Let φ : [m] → [n] be\nan order preserving function (so that if i ≤ j then φ(i) ≤ φ(j)). Identifying the\nelements of [n] with the vertices of the standard simplex Δn , φ extends to an affine\nmap Δm → Δn that we also denote by φ. Give a formula for this map in terms of\nbarycentric coordinates: If φ(s0, . . . , sm) = (t0, . . . , tn), what is tj as a function of\n(s0, . . . , sm)?\n(b) Write dj : [n - 1] → [n] for the order preserving injection that omits j as a value.\nShow that an order preserving injection φ : [n - k] → [n] is uniquely a composition\nof the form djk djk-1 · · · dj1 , with 0 ≤ j1 < j2 < · · · < jk ≤ n. Do this by describing\nthe integers j1, . . . , jk directly in terms of φ, and then verify the straightening rule\ndidj = dj+1di\nfor i ≤ j\n(c) Show that any order preserving map φ : [m] → [n] factors uniquely as the\ncomposition of an order preserving surjection followed by an order preserving injection\n(d) Write si : [m+1] → [m] for the order-preserving surjection that repeats the value\ni. Show that any order-preserving surjection φ : [m] → [n] has a unique expression\n(sn)in (sn-1)in-1 · · · (s0)i0 . Do this by describing the numbers i0, . . . , in, directly in\ni j\nterms of φ, and finding a straightening rule of the form s s = · · · for i < j.\n(e) Finally, implement your assertion that any order preserving map factors as a\nsurjection followed by an injection by establishing a straightening rule of the form\nidj\ns\n= · · · .\nRecall the notation Sinn(X) for the set of continuous maps from Δn to the space X.\nThe affine extension φ : Δm → Δn of an order-preserving map φ : [m] → [m] induces\na map φ∗ : Sinn(X) → Sinm(X). In particular, write\ndi = (di) ∗\nsj = (sj ) ∗ .\nThe di's are face maps, the si's are degeneracies.\n(f) Write down the identities satisfied by these operators, resulting from the identities\nyou found relating the di's and sj 's.\nA simplicial set is a sequence of sets K0, K1, . . ., with maps di : Kn → Kn-1, 0 ≤ i ≤ n,\nand si : Kn → Kn+1, 0 ≤ i ≤ n, satisfying these identities. For example, we have the\nsingular simplicial set Sin∗(X) of a space X.\nThe group of n-chains on X is the free abelian group generated by the n-simplices:\nSn(X) = ZSinn(X) .\n\nEach operator φ : Sinn(X) → Sinm(X) extends uniquely to a homomorphism φ :\nSn(X) → Sm(X). In particular, di : Sn(X) → Sn-1(X), 0 ≤ i ≤ n. We can combine\nthese homomorphism to form the boundary map\nn\nX\nd =\n(-1)idi : Sn(X) → Sn-1(X) .\ni=0\n(g) Use the relations among the di's to prove that\nd2 = 0 : Sn(X) → Sn-2(X) .\n(h) Let f : X → Y be a continuous map. By composition, we get a map f∗ :\nSinn(X) → Sinn(Y ). Show that together these form a map of simplicial sets (i.e.\nthey commute with the maps induced by order preserving maps φ : [m] → [n]).\n2.\n(a) Write down a singular 2-cycle representing the \"fundamental class\" of the\ntorus T 2 = S1 × S1 . We will give a precise definition of the fundamental class of a\nmanifold later, but for now let's just say that this cycle should be made up of singular\n2-simplices which together cover all but a small (e.g. nowhere dense) subset of T 2\nexactly once.\n(b) Construct an isomorphism\nHn(X) ⊕ Hn(Y ) → Hn(X q Y ) .\n3.\n(a) Write π0(X) for the set of path-components of a space X. Construct an\nisomorphism\nZπ0(X) → H0(X) .\n(b) Say what it means to assert that the isomorphisms you constructed in 2(b) and\n3(a) are natural, and make sure they are.\n4. Here are a couple more \"categorical\" definitions, giving you some practice with\nthe idea of constructions being defined by universal mapping properties.\nLet C be a category, A a set, and a 7→ Xa an assignment of an object of C to\neach element of A. A product of these objects is an object Y together with maps\npra : Y → Xa with the following property. For any object Z and any family of maps\nfa : Z → Xa, there is a unique map Z → Y such that fa = pra * f for all a ∈ A. A\ncoproduct of these objects is an object Y together with maps ina : Xa → Y with the\nfollowing property. For any object Z and any family of maps fa : Xa → Z, there is a\nunique map Y → Z such that fa = f * ina for all a ∈ A.\n(a) Describe constructions of the product and coproduct (if they exist) in the following\ncategories: sets, pointed sets, spaces, abelian groups. (A pointed set is a pair (S, ∗)\nwhere S is a set and ∗∈ S.)\n(b) What should be meant by the product when A = ∅? How about the coproduct?\nWhat are these objects in the four categories mentioned in (a)? Give an example of\na category in which neither one of these constructions exists.\n\n(c) Show that if (Y, {pr }) and (Y 0 , {pr0 }) are both products of a family {Xa : a ∈ A},\na\na\n→ Y 0\nthen there is a unique map f : Y\nsuch that pra * f = pra for all a ∈ A, and\nthat this map is an isomorphism.\n(d) A partially ordered set S defines a category as follows. The objects are the\nelements of S. (They constitute a set, rather than something larger, so this is a\n\"small category.\") For s, s0 ∈ S, there is exactly one morphism s → s0 if s ≤ s0, and\nnone otherwise.\nTake S to be the real numbers R with their natural order, for example, and consider\na map A → R. Under what conditions does the product of these objects exist, and\nif it does what is it? Same question for the coproduct.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.905 Algebraic Topology I\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

It is acyclic if H(A) = 0, and\ncontractible if it is chain-homotopy-equivalent to the trivial chain complex.

Propose a construction of the product and the coproduct of two spaces in the\nhomotopy category, and check that your proposal serves the purpose.\n7.(a) Let S and T be sets and A an abelian group. Establish a bijection between the\nset of maps of sets from S × T to A and the set of bilinear maps ZS × ZT → A.\n(b) For positive integers m, n, let Z/m, Z/n denote the cyclic groups of order m, n.\nConstruct a surjective bilinear map μ : Z/m × Z/n → Z/ gcd{m, n}.

Assume that all three columns are exact,\nthat all but one of the rows is exact, and that the compositions in the remaining row\nare trivial. Prove that the remaining row is also exact. (Hint: view each row as a\nchain complex . . . .)\n(b) (\"Long exact homology sequence of a triple.\") Let (C, B, A) be a \"triple,\" so\nC is a space, B is a subspace of C, and A is a subspace of B. Show that there are\nnatural transformations ∂ : Hn(C, B) → Hn-1(B, A) such that\ni∗\nj∗\n∂\n· · · -→ Hn(B, A) -→ Hn(C, A) -→ Hn(C, B) -→ Hn-1(B, A) -→ · · ·\nis exact, where i : (B, A) → (C, A) and j : (C, A) → (C, B) are the inclusions of\npairs. (9 (a) might be useful.)\n10. This exercise generalizes our computation of the homology of spheres, and intro\nduces several important constructions.\nThe cone on a space X is the quotient space CX = X × I/X × {0}, where I is the\nunit interval [0, 1]. The cone is a pointed space, with basepoint ∗ given by the \"cone\npoint,\" i.e. the image of X × {0}. (By convention, the cone on the empty space ∅ is\na single point, the cone point.) Regard X as the subspace of CX of all points of the\nform (x, 1).\nDefine the suspension of a space X to be SX = CX/X. Make SX a pointed space\nby declaring the image of X ⊆ CX to be the basepoint in SX. (By convention, the\nquotient W/∅ is the disjoint union of W with a single point, which is declared to be\nthe basepoint. So S∅ = ∗/∅ is the discrete two-point space, with the new point as\nbasepoint.)\nThe quotient map induces a map of pairs f : (CX, X) → (SX, ∗).\n(a) Show that CX is contractible.\ne\n(b) Show that there is a natural isomorphism Hn-1(X) → Hn(SX, ∗), for any n.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.905 Algebraic Topology I\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(a) In class I discussed a monoid homomorphism\ndeg : [Sn, Sn] → Z×\n(where Z× is the integers with monoid structure given by multiplication, and n ≥ 1),\ngiven by sending f to its effect on Hn(Sn). I asserted that it was surjective, but this\nwas an induction based on the case n = 1. Regard S1 as the unit circle in the complex\nplane. In class I claimed that the map z 7→ zd has degree d. Please verify this claim.\n(b) Regard Sn-1 as the unit sphere in Rn . Let L be a line through the origin in Rn ,\nand L⊥ its orthogonal complement. Let ρL be the linear map given by -1 on L and\n+1 on L⊥ . What is deg ρL?\n(c) What is the degree of the \"antipodal map,\" α : Sn-1 → Sn-1 sending x to -x?\n(d) The tangent space to a point x on the sphere Sn-1 can be regarded as the subspace\nof Rn of vectors perpendicular to x.

Use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the homology groups of the projec\ntive plane P , the Klein bottle K, and the torus T . (The projective plane is obtained\nby sewing a disk onto a M obius band along their boundaries. The Klein bottle is ob\ntained either by sewing two M obius bands together, or by sewing the two boundary\ncomponents of a cylinder together in a funny way. A torus is obtained by sewing the\nboundary components of a cylinder together in a less funny way. In each case, it's a\ngood idea to give yourself a hem: glue open \"collars\" together.)\n(b) Hopefully you computed that H2(T ) is an infinite cyclic group. Say something\nsensible about whether the \"fundamental class\" you constructed in Problem 2 is\nindeed a generator of that abelian group.\n13. ∅.\n14. The constructions sketched in Problem 12 are examples of the following general\nprocedure. Take two closed surfaces, Σ1 and Σ2, cut a disk out from each one, and\nglue them together along the hem. This is the connected sum Σ1#Σ2. Write T1 for the\ntorus, and Tg = T1#Tg-1. Write P1 for the projective plane, and Pg = P1#Pg-1.

      "content": "Lectures on Algebraic Topology\nLectures by Haynes Miller\nNotes based on a liveTEXed record made by Sanath Devalapurkar\nPictures by Xianglong Ni\nFall 2016\ni\n\niii\nPreface\nOver the 2016-2017 academic year, I ran the graduate algebraic topology sequence at MIT. The\nfirst semester traditionally deals with singular homology and cohomology and Poicare duality; the\nsecond builds up basic homotopy theory, spectral sequences, and characteristic classes.\nMy goal was to give a pretty standard classical approach to these subjects. In the first semester,\nI had various more specific objectives as well. I wanted to introduce students to the basic language\nof category theory and simplicial sets, so useful throughout mathematics and finding their first real\nmanifestations in algebraic topology. I wanted to stress the methods of homological algebra, for\nsimilar reasons. And I especially wanted to give an honest account of the machinery - relative cap\nproduct and Cech cohomology - needed in the proof of Poincare duality. The present document\ncontains a bit more detail on these last matters than was presented in the course itself.\nOn the other hand I barely touched on some important subjects. I did not talk about simplicial\ncomplexes at all, nor about the Lefschetz fixed point theorem. I gave only a brief summary of the\ntheory of covering spaces and the fundamental group, in preparation for a proper understanding\nof orientations. I avoided some point set topology by working with only compact subspaces rather\nthan general closed subspaces in the development of Poincare duality.\nI was lucky enough to have in the audience a student, Sanath Devalapurkar, who spontaneously\ndecided to liveTEX the entire course. This resulted in a remarkably accurate record of what happened\nin the classroom - right down to random alarms ringing and embarassing jokes and mistakes on\nthe blackboard. Sanath's TEX forms the basis of these notes, and I am grateful to him for making\nthem available. The attractive drawings were provided by another student, Xianglong Ni, who also\ncarefully proofread the manuscript.\nIn the course of editing these notes, beyond correcting various errors (while hopefully not intro-\nducting too many new ones), I completed a few arguments not done in detail in the actual lectures\nand rearranged some of the material to take full advantage of hindsight. I tried not to do too much\ndamage to the light and spontaneous character of Sanath's original notes. I hope you find these\nnotes useful, and I welcome comments or corrections!\n\nContents\nContents\niv\nSingular homology\nIntroduction: singular simplices and chains\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nHomology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCategories, functors, natural transformations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCategorical language . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nHomotopy, star-shaped regions\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nHomotopy invariance of homology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nHomology cross product . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nRelative homology\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nThe homology long exact sequence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nExcision and applications\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nThe Eilenberg Steenrod axioms and the locality principle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nSubdivision . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nProof of the Locality Principle\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nComputational methods\nCW-complexes\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCW-complexes II . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nHomology of CW-complexes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nReal projective space . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nEuler characteristic and homology approximation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCoefficients . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nTensor product . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nTensor and Tor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nThe fundamental theorem of homological algebra . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nHom and Lim . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nUniversal coefficient theorem\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nKunneth and Eilenberg-Zilber . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCohomology and duality\nCoproducts, cohomology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nExt and UCT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nProducts in cohomology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCup product, continued\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nSurfaces and nondegenerate symmetric bilinear forms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nLocal coefficients and orientations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\niv\n\nCONTENTS\nv\nProof of the orientation theorem\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nA plethora of products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCap product and \"Cech\" cohomology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCech cohomology as a cohomology theory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nThe fully relative cap product . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100\nPoincare duality\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 102\nApplications . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 105\nBibliography\n\nChapter 1\nSingular homology\nIntroduction: singular simplices and chains\nThis is a course on algebraic topology. We'll discuss the following topics.\n1. Singular homology\n2. CW-complexes\n3. Basics of category theory\n4. Homological algebra\n5. The Kunneth theorem\n6. Cohomology\n7. Universal coefficient theorems\n8. Cup and cap products\n9. Poincare duality.\nThe objects of study are of course topological spaces, and the machinery we develop in this course\nis designed to be applicable to a general space. But we are really mainly interested in geometrically\nimportant spaces. Here are some examples.\n- The most basic example is n-dimensional Euclidean space, Rn.\n- The n-sphere Sn = {x ∈Rn+1 : |x| = 1}, topologized as a subspace of Rn+1.\n- Identifying antipodal points in Sn gives real projective space RPn = Sn/(x ∼-x), i.e. the\nspace of lines through the origin in Rn+1.\n- Call an ordered collection of k orthonormal vectors an orthonormal k-frame. The space of\northonormal k-frames in Rn forms the Stiefel manifold Vk(Rn), topologized as a subspace of\n(Sn-1)k.\n- The Grassmannian Grk(Rn) is the space of k-dimensional linear subspaces of Rn. Forming\nthe span gives us a surjection Vk(Rn) →Grk(Rn), and the Grassmannian is given the quotient\ntopology. For example, Gr1(Rn) = RPn-1.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nAll these examples are manifolds; that is, they are Hausdorffspaces locally homeomorphic to Eu-\nclidean space. Aside from Rn itself, the preceding examples are also compact. Such spaces exhibit\na hidden symmetry, which is the culmination of 18.905: Poincare duality.\nAs the name suggests, the central aim of algebraic topology is the usage of algebraic tools to\nstudy topological spaces. A common technique is to probe topological spaces via maps to them\nfrom simpler spaces. In different ways, this approach gives rise to singular homology and homotopy\ngroups. We now detail the former; the latter takes the stage in 18.906.\nDefinition 1.1. For n ≥0, the standard n-simplex ∆n is the convex hull of the standard basis\n{e0, . . . , en} in Rn+1:\n∆n =\nnX\ntiei :\nX\nti = 1, ti ≥0\no\n⊆Rn+1.\nThe ti are called barycentric coordinates.\nThe standard simplices are related by face inclusions di : ∆n-1 →∆n for 0 ≤i ≤n, where di is\nthe affine map that sends verticies to vertices, in order, and omits the vertex ei.\nDefinition 1.2. Let X be any topological space. A singular n-simplex in X is a continuous map\nσ : ∆n →X. Denote by Sinn(X) the set of all n-simplices in X.\nThis seems like a rather bold construction to make, as Sinn(X) is huge. But be patient!\nFor 0 ≤i ≤n, precomposition by the face inclusion di produces a map di : Sinn(X) →Sinn-1(X)\nsending σ 7→σ *di. This is the \"ith face\" of σ. This allows us to make sense of the \"boundary\" of\na simplex, and we are particularly interested in simplices for which that boundary vanishes.\nFor example, if σ is a 1-simplex that forms a closed loop, then d1σ = d0σ. To express the\ncondition that the boundary vanishes, we would like to write d0σ -d1σ = 0 - but this difference is\nno longer a simplex. To accommodate such formal sums, we will enlarge Sinn(X) further by forming\nthe free abelian group it generates.\nDefinition 1.3. The abelian group Sn(X) of singular n-chains in X is the free abelian group\ngenerated by n-simplices\nSn(X) = ZSinn(X).\nSo an n-chain is a finite linear combination of simplices,\nk\nX\ni=1\naiσi ,\nai ∈Z ,\nσi ∈Sinn(X) .\nIf n < 0, Sinn(X) is declared to be empty, so Sn(X) = 0.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION: SINGULAR SIMPLICES AND CHAINS\nWe can now define the boundary operator\nd: Sinn(X) →Sn-1(X),\nby\ndσ =\nn\nX\ni=0\n(-1)idiσ.\nThis extends to a homomorphism d: Sn(X) →Sn-1(X) by additivity.\nWe use this homomorphism to obtain something more tractable than the entirety of Sn(X).\nFirst we restrict our attention to chains with vanishing boundary.\nDefinition 1.4. An n-cycle in X is an n-chain c with dc = 0. Notation:\nZn(X) = ker(d : Sn(X) →Sn-1(X)) .\nFor example, if σ is a 1-simplex forming a closed loop, then σ ∈Z1(X) since dσ = d0σ-d1σ = 0.\nIt turns out that there's a cheap way to produce a cycle:\nTheorem 1.5. Any boundary is a cycle; that is, d2 = 0.\nWe'll leave the verification of this important result as a homework problem. What we have\nfound, then, is that the singular chains form a \"chain complex,\" as in the following definition.\nDefinition 1.6. A graded abelian group is a sequence of abelian groups, indexed by the integers. A\nchain complex is a graded abelian group {An} together with homomorphisms d : An →An-1 with\nthe property that d2 = 0.\nThe group of n-dimensional boundaries is\nBn(X) = im(d : Sn+1(X) →Sn(X)) ,\nand the theorem tells us that this is a subgroup of the group of cycles: the \"cheap\" ones. If we\nquotient by them, what's left is the \"interesting cycles,\" captured in the following definition.\nDefinition 1.7. The nth singular homology group of X is:\nHn(X) = Zn(X)\nBn(X) = ker(d : Sn(X) →Sn-1(X))\nim(d : Sn+1(X) →Sn(X)) .\nWe use the same language for any chain complex: it has cycles, boundaries, and homology\ngroups. The homology forms a graded abelian group.\nBoth Zn(X) and Bn(X) are free abelian groups because they are subgroups of the free abelian\ngroup Sn(X), but the quotient Hn(X) isn't necessarily free. While Zn(X) and Bn(X) are uncount-\nably generated, Hn(X) turns out to be finitely generated for the spaces we are interested in. If T is\nthe torus, for example, then we will see that H1(T) ∼= Z ⊕Z, with generators given by the 1-cycles\nillustrated below.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nWe will learn to compute the homology groups of a wide variety of spaces. The n-sphere for\nexample has the following homology groups:\nHq(Sn) =\n\nZ\nif\nq = n > 0\nZ\nif\nq = 0, n > 0\nZ ⊕Z\nif\nq = n = 0\notherwise .\nHomology\nIn the last lecture we introduced the standard n-simplex ∆n ⊆Rn+1. Singular simplices in a space\nX are maps σ: ∆n →X and constitute the set Sinn(X). For example, Sin0(X) consists of points\nof X. We also described the face inclusions di : ∆n-1 →∆n, and the induced \"face maps\"\ndi : Sinn(X) →Sinn-1(X) , 0 ≤i ≤n ,\ngiven by precomposing with face inclusions: diσ = σ *di. For homework you established some\nquadratic relations satisfied by these maps. A collection of sets Kn, n ≥0, together with maps\ndi : Kn →Kn-1 related to each other in this way, is a semi-simplicial set. So we have assigned to\nany space X a semi-simplicial set S∗(X).\nTo the semi-simplicial set {Sinn(X), di} we then applied the free abelian group functor, obtaining\na semi-simplicial abelian group. Using the dis, we constructed a boundary map d which makes S∗(X)\na chain complex - that is, d2 = 0. We capture this process in a diagram:\n{spaces}\nSin∗\n\nH∗\n/ {graded abelian groups}\n{semi-simplicial sets}\nZ(-)\n\n{semi-simplicial abelian groups}\n/ {chain complexes}\ntake homology\nO\nExample 2.1. Suppose we have σ: ∆1 →X. Define φ: ∆1 →∆1 by sending (t, 1 -t) to (1 -t, t).\nPrecomposing σ with φ gives another singular simplex σ which reverses the orientation of σ. It is\nnot true that σ = -σ in S1(X).\nHowever, we claim that σ ≡-σ mod B1(X). This means that there is a 2-chain in X whose\nboundary is σ + σ. If d0σ = d1σ, so that σ ∈Z1(X), then σ and -σ are homologous: [σ] = -[σ] in\nH1(X).\nTo construct an appropriate boundary, consider the projection map π : ∆2 →∆1 that is the\naffine extension of the map sending e0 and e2 to e0 and e1 to e1.\n\n2. HOMOLOGY\nWe'll compute d(σ *π). Some of the terms will be constant singular simplices. Let's write\ncn\nx : ∆n →X for the constant map with value x ∈X. Then\nd(σ *π) = σπd0 -σπd1 + σπd2 = σ -c1\nσ(0) + σ .\nThe constant simplex c1\nσ(0) is an \"error term,\" and we wish to eliminate it. To achieve this we can\nuse the constant 2-simplex c2\nσ(0) at σ(0); its boundary is\nc1\nσ(0) -c1\nσ(0) + c1\nσ(0) = c1\nσ(0) .\nSo\nσ + σ = d(σ *π + c2\nσ(0)) ,\nand σ ≡-σ mod B1(X) as claimed.\nSome more language: two cycles that differ by a boundary dc are said to be homologous, and\nthe chain c is a homology between them.\nLet's compute the homology of the very simplest spaces, ∅and ∗. For the first, Sinn(∅) = ∅,\nso S∗(∅) = 0. Hence · · · →S2 →S1 →S0 is the zero chain complex. This means that Z∗(∅) =\nB∗(∅) = 0. The homology in all dimensions is therefore 0.\nFor ∗, we have Sinn(∗) = {cn\n∗} for all n ≥0. Consequently Sn(∗) = Z for n ≥0 and 0 for n < 0.\nFor each i, dicn\n∗= cn-1\n∗\n, so the boundary maps d: Sn(∗) →Sn-1(∗) in the chain complex depend\non the parity of n as follows:\nd(cn\n∗) =\nn\nX\ni=0\n(-1)icn-1\n∗\n=\n(\ncn-1\n∗\nfor n even, and\nfor n odd.\nThis means that our chain complex is:\n0 ←Z\n0←-Z\n1←-Z\n0←-Z\n1←-· · · .\nThe boundaries coincide with the cycles except in dimension zero, where B0(∗) = 0 while Z0(∗) = Z.\nTherefore H0(∗) = Z and Hi(∗) = 0 for i = 0.\nWe've defined homology groups for each space, but haven't yet considered what happens to\nmaps between spaces. A continuous map f : X →Y induces a map f∗: Sinn(X) →Sinn(Y ) by\ncomposition:\nf∗: σ 7→f *σ .\nFor f∗to be a map of semi-simplicial sets, it needs to commute with face maps: We need f∗*di =\ndi *f∗. A diagram is said to be commutative if all composites with the same source and target are\nequal, so this equation is equivalent to commutativity of the diagram\nSinn(X)\nf∗\n/\ndi\n\nSinn(Y )\ndi\n\nSinn-1(X)\nf∗/ Sinn-1(Y ) .\nWell, dif∗σ = (f∗σ) *di = f *σ *di, and f∗(diσ) = f∗(σ *di) = f *σ *di as well. The diagram\nremains commutative when we pass to the free abelian groups of chains.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nIf C∗and D∗are chain complexes, a chain map f : C∗→D∗is a collection of maps fn : Cn →Dn\nsuch that the following diagram commutes for every n:\nCn\nfn\n/\ndC\n\nDn\ndD\n\nCn-1\nfn-1 / Dn-1\nFor example, if f : X →Y is a continuous map, then f∗: S∗(X) →S∗(Y ) is a chain map as discussed\nabove.\nA chain map induces a map in homology f∗: Hn(C) →Hn(D). The method of proof is a so-\ncalled \"diagram chase\" and it will be the first of many. We check that we get a map Zn(C) →Zn(D).\nLet c ∈Zn(C), so that dCc = 0. Then dDfn(c) = fn-1dCc = fn-1(0) = 0, because f is a chain\nmap. This means that fn(c) is also an n-cycle, i.e., f gives a map Zn(C) →Zn(D).\nSimilarly, we get a map Bn(C) →Bn(D). Let c ∈Bn(C), so that there exists c′ ∈Cn+1 such\nthat dCc′ = c. Then fn(c) = fndCc′ = dDfn+1(c′). Thus fn(c) is the boundary of fn+1(c′), and f\ngives a map Bn(C) →Bn(D).\nThe two maps Zn(C) →Zn(D) and Bn(C) →Bn(D) quotient to give a map on homology\nf∗: Hn(X) →Hn(Y ).\nCategories, functors, natural transformations\nFrom spaces and continuous maps, we constructed graded abelian groups and homomorphisms. We\nnow cast this construction in the more general language of category theory.\nOur discussion of category theory will be interspersed throughout the text, introducing new\nconcepts as they are needed. Here we begin by introducing the basic definitions.\nDefinition 3.1. A category C consists of the following data.\n- a class ob(C) of objects;\n- for every pair of objects X and Y , a set of morphisms C(X, Y );\n- for every object X an identity morphism 1X ∈C(X, X); and\n- for every triple of objects X, Y, Z, a composition map C(X, Y ) × C(Y, Z) →C(X, Z), written\n(f, g) 7→g *f.\nThese data are required to satisfy the following:\n- 1Y *f = f, and f *1X = f.\n- Composition is associative: (h *g) *f = h *(g *f).\nNote that we allow the collection of objects to be a class. This enables us to talk about a\n\"category of all sets\" for example. But we require each C(X, Y ) to be set, and not merely a class.\nSome interesting categories have a set of objects; they are called small categories.\nWe will often write X ∈C to mean X ∈ob(C), and f : X →Y to mean f ∈C(X, Y ).\n\n3. CATEGORIES, FUNCTORS, NATURAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nDefinition 3.2. If X, Y ∈C, then f : X →Y is an isomorphism if there exists g: Y →X with\nf *g = 1Y and g *f = 1X. We may write\nf : X\n∼\n=\n-→Y\nto indicate that f is an isomorphism.\nExample 3.3. Many common mathematical structures can be arranged in categories.\n- Sets and functions between them form a category Set.\n- Abelian groups and homomorphisms form a category Ab.\n- Topological spaces and continuous maps form a category Top.\n- Chain complexes and chain maps form a category chAb.\n- A monoid is the same as a category with one object, where the elements of the monoid are\nthe morphisms in the category. It's a small category.\n- The sets [n] = {0, . . . , n} for n ≥0 together with weakly order-preserving maps between\nthem form the simplex category ∆, another small category. It contains as a subcategory the\nsemi-simplex category ∆inj with the same objects but only injective weakly order-preserving\nmaps.\n- A partially ordered set or \"poset\" forms a category in which there is a morphism from x to y\niffx ≤y. A small category is a poset exactly when (1) there is at most one morphism between\nany two objects, and (2) the only isomorphisms are identities. This is to be distinguished\nfrom the category of posets and order-preserving maps between them, which is \"large.\"\nCategories may be related to each other by rules describing effect on both objects and morphisms.\nDefinition 3.4. Let C, D be categories. A functor F : C →D consists of the data of\n- an assignment F : ob(C) →ob(D), and\n- for all X, Y ∈ob(C), a function F : C(X, Y ) →D(F(X), F(Y )) .\nThese data are required to satisfy the following two properties:\n- For all X ∈ob(C), F(1X) = 1F(X) ∈D(F(X), F(X)), and\n- For all composable pairs of morphisms f, g in C, F(g *f) = F(g) *F(f).\nWe have defined quite a few functors already:\nSinn : Top →Set ,\nSn : Top →Ab ,\nHn : Top →Ab ,\nfor example. We also have defined, for each X, a morphism d : Sn(X) →Sn-1(X). This is a\n\"morphism between functors.\" This property is captured by another definition.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

Let F, G: C →D be two functors.\nA natural transformation or natural map\nθ: F →G consists of maps θX : F(X) →G(X) for all X ∈ob(C) such that for all f : X →Y the\nfollowing diagram commutes.\nF(X)\nF(f)\n\nθX / G(X)\nG(f)\n\nF(Y )\nθY\n/ G(Y )\nSo for example the boundary map d: Sn →Sn-1 is a natural transformation.\nExample 3.6. Suppose that C and D are two categories, and assume that C is small. We may then\nform the category of functors Fun(C, D). Its objects are the functors from C to D, and given two\nfunctors F, G, Fun(C, D)(F, G) is the set of natural transformations from F to G. We let the reader\ndefine the rest of the structure of this category, and check the axioms. We needed to assume that C\nis small in order to guarantee that there is no more than a set of natural transformations between\nfunctors.\nFor example, let G be a group (or a monoid) viewed as a one-object category.\nAn object\nF ∈Fun(G, Ab) is simply a group action of G on F(∗) = A, i.e., a representation of G in abelian\ngroups. Given another F ′ ∈Fun(G, Ab) with F ′(∗) = A′, a natural transformation from F →F ′\nis precisely a G-equivariant homomorphism A →A′.\nCategorical language\nLet Vectk be the category of vector spaces over a field k, and linear transformations between them.\nGiven a vector space V , you can consider the dual V ∗= Hom(V, k). Does this give us a functor? If\nyou have a linear transformation f : V →W, you get a map f∗: W ∗→V ∗, so this is like a functor,\nbut the induced map goes the wrong way. This operation does preserve composition and identities,\nin an appropriate sense. This is an example of a contravariant functor.\nI'll leave it to you to spell out the definition, but notice that there is a univeral example of\na contravariant functor out of a category C: C →Cop, where Cop has the same objects as C, but\nCop(X, Y ) is declared to be the set C(Y, X). The identity morphisms remain the same. To describe\nthe composition in Cop, I'll write fop for f ∈C(Y, X) regarded as an element of Cop(X, Y ); then\nfop *gop = (g *f)op.\nThen a contravariant functor from C to D is the same thing as a (\"covariant\") functor from Cop\nto D.\nLet C be a category, and let Y ∈ob(C). We get a map Cop →Set that takes X 7→C(X, Y ), and\ntakes a map X →W to the map defined by composition C(W, Y ) →C(X, Y ). This is called the\nfunctor represented by Y . It is very important to note that C(-, Y ) is contravariant, while, on the\nother hand, for any fixed X, C(X, -) is a covariant functor (and is said to be \"corepresentable\" by\nX).\nExample 4.1. Recall that the simplex category ∆has objects the totally ordered sets [n] =\n{0, 1, . . . , n}, with order preserving maps as morphisms. The \"standard simplex\" gives us a functor\n∆: ∆→Top. Now fix a space X, and consider\n[n] 7→Top(∆n, X) .\nThis gives us a contravariant functor ∆→Set, or a covariant functor ∆op →Set. This functor\ncarries in it all the face and degeneracy maps we discussed earlier, and their compositions. Let us\nmake a definition.\n\n4. CATEGORICAL LANGUAGE\nDefinition 4.2. Let C be any category. A simplicial object in C is a functor K : ∆op →C. Simplicial\nobjects in C form a category with natural transformations as morphisms. Similarly, semi-simplicial\nobject in C is a functor ∆op\ninj →C,\nSo the singular functor Sin∗gives a functor from spaces to simplicial sets (and so, by restriction,\nto semi-simplicial sets).\nI want to interject one more bit of categorical language that will often be useful to us.\nDefinition 4.3. A morphism f : X →Y in a category C is a split epimorphism (\"split epi\" for short)\nif there exists g : Y →X (called a section or a splitting) such that the composite Y\ng-→X\nf-→Y is\nthe identity.\nExample 4.4. In the category of sets, a map f : X →Y is a split epimorphism exactly when, for\nevery element of Y there exists some element of X whose image in Y is the original element. So f is\nsurjective. Is every surjective map a split epimorphism? This is equivalent to the axiom of choice!\nbecause a section of f is precisely a choice of x ∈f-1(y) for every y ∈Y .\nEvery categorical definition is accompanied by a \"dual\" definition.\nDefinition 4.5. A map g : Y →X is a split monomorphism (\"split mono\" for short) if there is\nf : X →Y such that f *g = 1Y .\nExample 4.6. Again let C = Set. Any split monomorphism is an injection: If y, y′ ∈Y , and\ng(y) = g(y′), we want to show that y = y′. Apply f, to get y = f(g(y)) = f(g(y′)) = y′. But the\ninjection ∅→Y is a split monomorphism only if Y = ∅. So there's an asymmetry in the category\nof sets.\nLemma 4.7. A map is an isomorphism if and only if it is both a split epimorphism and a split\nmonomorphism.\nProof. Easy!\nThe importance of these definitions is this: Functors will not in general respect \"monomorphisms\"\nor \"epimorphisms,\" but:\nLemma 4.8. Any functor sends split epis to split epis and split monos to split monos.\nProof. Apply F to the diagram establishing f as a split epi or mono.\nExample 4.9. Suppose C = Ab, and you have a split epi f : A →B. Let g : B →A be a section.\nWe also have the inclusion i : ker f →A, and hence a map\n[ g\ni ] : B ⊕ker f →A .\nI leave it to you to check that this map is an isomorphism, and to formulate a dual statement.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nHomotopy, star-shaped regions\nWe've computed the homology of a point. Let's now compare the homology of a general space X\nto this example. There's always a unique map X →∗: ∗is a \"terminal object\" in Top. We have\nan induced map\nHn(X) →Hn(∗) =\n(\nZ\nn = 0\notherwise .\nAny formal linear combination c = P aixi of points of X is a 0-cycle. The map to ∗sends c to\nP ai ∈Z. This defines the augmentation ε : H∗(X) →H∗(∗). If X is nonempty, the map X →∗\nis split by any choice of point in X, so the augmentation is also split epi. The kernel of ε is the\nreduced homology eH∗(X) of X, and we get a canonical splitting\nH∗(X) ∼= eH∗(X) ⊕Z .\nActually, it's useful to extend the definition to the empty space by the following device. Extend\nthe singular chain complex for any space to include Z in dimension -1, with d : S0(X) →S-1(X)\ngiven by the augmentation ε sending each 0-simplex to 1 ∈Z. Let's write eS∗(X) for this chain\ncomplex, and eH∗(X) for its homology. When X = ∅, ε is surjective and you get the same answer\nas above. But\neHq(∅) =\n(\nZ\nfor q = -1\nfor q = -1 .\nThis convention is not universally accepted, but I find it useful. eH∗(X) is the reduced homology of\nX.\nWhat other spaces have trivial homology? A slightly non-obvious way to reframe the question\nis this:\nWhen do two maps X →Y induce the same map in homology?\nFor example, when do 1X : X →X and X →∗→X induce the same map in homology? If they\ndo, then ε : H∗(X) →Z is an isomorphism.\nThe key idea is that homology is a discrete invariant, so it should be unchanged by deformation.\nHere's the definition that makes \"deformation\" precise.\nDefinition 5.1. Let f0, f1 : X →Y be two maps. A homotopy from f0 to f1 is a map h : X×I →Y\n(continuous, of course) such that h(x, 0) = f0(x) and f(x, 1) = f1(x). We say that f0 and f1 are\nhomotopic, and that h is a homotopy between them. This relation is denoted by f0 ≃f1.\nHomotopy is an equivalence relation on maps from X to Y . Transitivity follows from the gluing\nlemma of point set topology. We denote by [X, Y ] the set of homotopy classes of maps from X to\nY . A key result about homology is this:\nTheorem 5.2 (Homotopy invariance of homology). If f0 ≃f1, then H∗(f0) = H∗(f1): homology\ncannot distinguish between homotopic maps.\nSuppose I have two maps f0, f1 : X →Y with a homotopy h : f0 ≃f1, and a map g : Y →Z.\nComposing h with g gives a homotopy between g *f0 and g *f1. Precomposing also works: If\n\n5. HOMOTOPY, STAR-SHAPED REGIONS\ng : W →X is a map and f0, f1 : X →Y are homotopic, then f0 *g ≃f1 *g. This lets us compose\nhomotopy classes: we can complete the diagram:\nTop(Y, Z) × Top(X, Y )\n\n/ Top(X, Z)\n\n[Y, Z] × [X, Y ]\n/ [X, Z]\nDefinition 5.3. The homotopy category (of topological spaces) Ho(Top) has the same objects as\nTop, but Ho(Top)(X, Y ) = [X, Y ] = Top(X, Y )/ ≃.\nWe may restate Theorem 5.2 as follows:\nFor each n, the homology functor Hn : Top →Ab factors as Top →Ho(Top) →Ab;\nit is a \"homotopy functor.\"\nWe will prove this in the next lecture, but let's stop now and think about some consequences.\nDefinition 5.4. A map f : X →Y is a homotopy equivalence if [f] ∈[X, Y ] is an isomorphism in\nHo(Top). In other words, there is a map g : Y →X such that fg ≃1Y and gf ≃1X.\nSuch a map g is a homotopy inverse for f; it is well-defined only up to homotopy.\nMost topological properties are not preserved by homotopy equivalences. For example, com-\npactness is not a homotopy-invariant property: Consider the inclusion i : Sn-1 ⊆Rn -{0}. A\nhomotopy inverse p : Rn -{0} →Sn-1 can be obtained by dividing a (always nonzero!) vector\nby its length. Clearly p *i = 1Sn-1. We have to find a homotopy i *p ≃1Rn-{0}. This is a map\n(Rn -{0}) × I →Rn -{0}, and we can use (v, t) 7→tv + (1 -t) v\n||v||.\nOn the other hand:\nCorollary 5.5. Homotopy equivalences induce isomorphisms in homology.\nProof. If f has homotopy inverse g, then f∗has inverse g∗.\nDefinition 5.6. A space X is contractible if the map X →∗is a homotopy equivalence.\nCorollary 5.7. Let X be a contractible space. The augmentation ε : H∗(X) →Z is an isomorphism.\nHomotopy equivalences in general may be somewhat hard to visualize. A particularly simple\nand important class of homotopy equivalences is given by the following definition.\nDefinition 5.8. An inclusion A ,→X is a deformation retract provided that there is a map h :\nX × I →X such that h(x, 0) = x and h(x, 1) ∈A for all x ∈X and h(a, t) = a for all a ∈A and\nt ∈I.\nFor example, Sn-1 is a deformation retract of Rn -{0}.\nWe now set about constructing a proof of homotopy invariance of homology. The first step is to\nunderstand the analogue of homotopy on the level of chain complexes.\nDefinition 5.9. Let C∗, D∗be chain complexes, and f0, f1 : C∗→D∗be chain maps. A chain\nhomotopy h : f0 ≃f1 is a collection of homomorphisms h : Cn →Dn+1 such that dh+hd = f1 -f0.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nThis relation takes some getting used to. It is an equivalence relation. Here's a picture (not a\ncommutive diagram).\n· · ·\n/ Cn+1\n\nd\n/ Cn\nh\n|\n\nd / Cn-1\nh\n|\n\n/ · · ·\n· · ·\n/ Dn+1\nd\n/ Dn\nd / Dn-1\n/ · · ·\nLemma 5.10. If f0, f1 : C∗→D∗are chain homotopic, then f0∗= f1∗: H∗(C) →H∗(D).\nProof. We want to show that for every c ∈Zn(C∗), the difference f1c -f0c is a boundary. Well,\nf1c -f0c = (dh + hd)c = dhc + hdc = dhc .\nSo homotopy invariance of homology will follow from\nProposition 5.11. Let f0, f1 : X →Y be homotopic. Then f0∗, f1∗: S∗(X) →S∗(Y ) are chain\nhomotopic.\nTo prove this we will begin with a special case.\nDefinition 5.12. A subset X ⊆Rn is star-shaped with respect to b ∈X if for every x ∈X the\ninterval\n{tb + (1 -t)x : t ∈[0, 1]}\nlies in X.\nAny nonempty convex region is star shaped.\nAny star-shaped region X is contractible: A\nhomotopy inverse to X →∗is given by sending ∗7→b. One composite is perforce the identity. A\nhomotopy from the other composite to the identity 1X is given by (x, t) 7→tb + (1 -t)x.\nSo we should expect that ε : H∗(X) →Z is an isomorphism if X is star-shaped. In fact, using\na piece of language that the reader can interpret:\nProposition 5.13. S∗(X) →Z is a chain homotopy equivalence.\nProof. We have maps S∗(X)\nε-→Z\nη-→S∗(X) where η(1) = c0\nb. Clearly εη = 1, and the claim is\nthat ηε ≃1 : S∗(X) →S∗(X). The chain map ηε concentrates everything at the point b: ηεσ = cn\nb\nfor all σ ∈Sinn(X). Our chain homotopy h : Sq(X) →Sq+1(X) will actually send simplices to\n\n6. HOMOTOPY INVARIANCE OF HOMOLOGY\nsimplices. For σ ∈Sinq(X), define the chain homotopy evaluated on σ by means of the following\n\"cone construction\": h(σ) = b ∗σ, where\n(b ∗σ)(t0, . . . , tq+1) = t0b + (1 -t0)σ\n(t1, . . . , tq+1)\n1 -t0\n\n.\nExplanation: The denominator 1 -t0 makes the entries sum to 1, as they must if we are to apply\nσ to this vector. When t0 = 1, this isn't defined, but it doesn't matter since we are multiplying by\n1 -t0. So (b ∗σ)(1, 0, . . . , 0) = b; this is the vertex of the cone.\nSetting t0 = 0, we find\nd0b ∗σ = σ .\nSetting ti = 0 for i > 0, we find\ndib ∗σ = hdi-1σ .\nUsing the formula for the boundary operator, we find\ndb ∗σ = σ -b ∗dσ\n. . . unless q = 0, when\ndb ∗σ = σ -c0\nb .\nThis can be assembled into the equation\ndb ∗+b ∗d = 1 -ηε\nwhich is what we wanted.\nHomotopy invariance of homology\nWe now know that the homology of a star-shaped region is trivial: in such a space, every cycle with\naugmentation 0 is a boundary. We will use that fact, which is a special case of homotopy invariance\nof homology, to prove the general result, which we state in somewhat stronger form:\nTheorem 6.1. A homotopy h : f0 ≃f1 : X →Y determines a natural chain homotopy f0∗≃f1∗:\nS∗(X) →S∗(Y ).\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nThe proof uses naturality (a lot). For a start, notice that if k : g0 ≃g1 : C∗→D∗is a chain\nhomotopy, and j : D∗→E∗is another chain map, then the composites j *kn : Cn →En+1 give\na chain homootpy j *g0 ≃j *g1.\nSo if we can produce a chain homotopy between the chain\nmaps induced by the two inclusions i0, i1 : X →X × I, we can get a chain homotopy k between\nf0∗= h∗*i0∗and f1∗= h∗*i1∗in the form h∗*k.\nSo now we want to produce a natural chain homotopy, with components kn : Sn(X) →Sn+1(X×\nI). The unit interval hosts a natural 1-simplex given by an identification ∆1 →I, and we should\nimagine k as being given by \"multiplying\" by that 1-chain. This \"multiplication\" is a special case of\na chain map\n× : S∗(X) × S∗(Y ) →S∗(X × Y ) ,\ndefined for any two spaces X and Y , with lots of good properties. It will ultimately be used to\ncompute the homology of a product of two spaces in terms of the homology groups of the factors.\nHere's the general result.\nTheorem 6.2. There exists a map × : Sp(X) × Sq(Y ) →Sp+q(X × Y ), the cross product, that is:\n- Natural, in the sense that if f : X →X′ and g : Y →Y ′, and a ∈Sp(X) and b ∈Sp(Y ) so\nthat a × b ∈Sp+q(X × Y ), then f∗(a) × g∗(b) = (f × g)∗(a × b).\n- Bilinear, in the sense that (a + a′) × b = (a × b) + (a′ × b), and a × (b + b′) = a × b + a × b′.\n- The Leibniz rule is satisfied, i.e., d(a × b) = (da) × b + (-1)pa × db.\n- Normalized, in the following sense. Let x ∈X and y ∈Y . Write jx : Y →X × Y for\ny 7→(x, y), and write iy : X →X × Y for x 7→(x, y). If b ∈Sq(Y ), then c0\nx × b = (jx)∗b ∈\nSq(X × Y ), and if a ∈Sp(X), then a × c0\ny = (iy)∗a ∈Sp(X × Y ).\nThe Leibniz rule contains the first occurence of the \"topologist's sign rule\"; we'll see these signs\nappearing often. Watch for when it appears in our proof.\nProof. We're going to use induction on p+q; the normalization axiom gives us the cases p+q = 0, 1.\nLet's assume that we've constructed the cross-product in total dimension p + q -1. We want to\ndefine σ × τ for σ ∈Sp(X) and τ ∈Sq(Y ).\nNote that there's a universal example of a p-simplex, namely the identity map ιp : ∆p →∆p.\nIt's universal in the sense any p-simplex σ : ∆p →X can be written as σ∗(ιp) where σ∗: Sinp(∆p) →\nSinp(X) is the map induced by σ. To define σ × τ in general, then, it suffices to define ιp × ιq ∈\nSp+q(∆p × ∆q); we can (and must) then take σ × τ = (σ × τ)∗(ιp × ιq).\nOur long list of axioms is useful in the induction. For one thing, if p = 0 or q = 0, normalization\nprovides us with a choice. So now assume that both p and q are positive. We want the cross-product\nto satisfy the Leibnitz rule:\nd(ιp × ιq) = (dιp) × ιq + (-1)pιp × dιq ∈Sp+q-1(∆p × ∆q)\nSince d2 = 0, a necessary condition for ιp × ιq to exist is that d((dιp) × ιq + (-1)pιp × dιq) = 0.\nLet's compute what this is, using the Leibnitz rule in dimension p + q -1 where we have it by the\ninductive assumption:\nd((dιp)×ιq+(-1)pιp×(dιq)) = (d2ιp)×ιq+(-1)p-1(dιp)×(dιq)+(-1)p(dιp)×(dιq)+(-1)qιp×(d2ιq) = 0\nbecause d2 = 0. Note that this calculation would not have worked without the sign!\n\n7. HOMOLOGY CROSS PRODUCT\nThe subspace ∆p×∆q ⊆Rp+1×Rq+1 is convex and nonempty, and hence star-shaped. Therefore\nwe know that Hp+q-1(∆p × ∆q) = 0 (remember, p + q > 1), which means that every cycle is a\nboundary. In other words, our necessary condition is also sufficient! So, choose any element with\nthe right boundary and declare it to be ιp × ιq.\nThe induction is now complete provided we can check that this choice satisfies naturality, bilin-\nearity, and the Leibniz rule. I leave this as a relaxing exercise for the listener.\nThe essential point here is that the space supporting the universal pair of simplices - ∆p × ∆q\n- has trivial homology. Naturality transports the result of that fact to the general situation.\nThe cross-product that this procedure constructs is not unique; it depends on a choice a choice\nof the chain ιp × ιq for each pair p, q with p + q > 1. The cone construction in the proof that\nstar-shaped regions have vanishing homology provids us with a specific choice; but it turns out that\nany two choices are equivalent up to natural chain homotopy.\nWe return to homotopy invariance. To define our chain homotopy hX : Sn(X) →Sn+1(X × I),\npick any 1-simplex ι : ∆1 →I such that d0ι = c0\n1 and d1ι = c0\n0, and define\nhXσ = (-1)nσ × ι .\nLet's compute:\ndhXσ = (-1)nd(σ × ι) = (-1)n(dσ) × ι + σ × (dι)\nBut dι = c0\n1 -c0\n0 ∈S0(I), which means that we can continue (remembering that |∂σ| = n -1):\n= -hXdσ + (σ × c0\n1 -σ × c0\n0) = -hXdσ + (ι1∗σ -ι0∗σ) ,\nusing the normalization axiom of the cross-product. This is the result.\nHomology cross product\nIn the last lecture we proved homotopy invariance of homology using the construction of a chain\nlevel bilinear cross-product\n× : Sp(X) × Sq(Y ) →Sp+q(X × Y )\nthat satisfied the Leibniz formula\nd(a × b) = (da) × b + (-1)pa × (db)\nWhat else does this map give us?\nLet's abstract a little bit. Suppose we have three chain complexes A∗, B∗, and C∗, and suppose\nwe have maps × : Ap × Bq →Cp+q that satisfy bilinearity and the Leibniz formula. What does this\ninduce in homology?\nLemma 7.1. These data determine a bilinear map × : Hp(A) × Hq(B) →Hp+q(C).\nProof. Let a ∈Zp(A) and b ∈Zq(B). We want to define [a] × [b] ∈Hp+q(C). We hope that\n[a]×[b] = [a×b]. We need to check that a×b is a cycle. By Leibniz, d(a×b) = da×b+(-1)pa×db,\nwhich vanishes becauxe a, b are cycles.\nNow we need to check that homology class depends only on the homology classes we started\nwith. So pick other cycles a′ and b′ in the same homology classes. We want [a × b] = [a′ × b′]. In\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nother words, we need to show that a×b differs from a′ ×b′ by a boundary. We can write a′ = a+da\nand b′ = b + db, and compute, using bilinearity:\na′ × b′ = (a + da) + (b + db) = a × b + a × db + (da) × b + (da) × (db)\nWe need to deal with the last three terms here. But since da = 0,\nd(a × b) = (-1)pa × (db) .\nSince db = 0,\nd((a) × b) = (da) × b .\nAnd since d2b = 0,\nd(a × b) = (da) × (db) .\nThis means that a′ × b′ and a × b differ by\nd\n(-1)p(a × b) + a × b + a × db\n\n,\nand so are homologous.\nThe last step is to check bilinearity, which is left to the listener.\nThis gives the following result.\nTheorem 7.2. There is a map\n× : Hp(X) × Hq(Y ) →Hp+q(X × Y )\nthat is natural, bilinear, and normalized.\nWe will see that this map is also uniquely defined by these conditions, unlike the chain-level\ncross product.\nI just want to mention an explicit choice of ιp × ιq. This is called the Eilenberg-Zilber chain.\nYou're highly encouraged to think about this yourself. It comes from a triangulation of the prism.\nThe simplices in this triangulation are indexed by order preserving injections\nω : [p + q] →[p] × [q]\nInjectivity forces ω(0) = (0, 0) and ω(p + q) = (p, q). Each such map determines an affine map\n∆p+q →∆p × ∆q of the same name. These will be the singular simplices making up ιp × ιq. To\nspecify the coefficients, think of ω as a staircase in the rectangle [0, p] × [0, q]. Let A(ω) denote the\narea under that staircase. Then the Eilenberg-Zilber chain is given by\nιp × ιq =\nX\n(-1)A(ω)ω\n\n8. RELATIVE HOMOLOGY\nThis chain is due to Eilenberg and Mac Lane; the description appears in a paper [4] by Eilenberg\nand Moore.\nIt's very pretty, but it's combinatorially annoying to check that this satisfies the\nconditions of the theorem. It provides an explicit chain map\nβX,Y : S∗(X) × S∗(Y ) →S∗(X × Y )\nthat satisfies many good properties on the nose and not just up to chain homotopy. For example,\nit's associative -\nS∗(X) × S∗(Y ) × S∗(Z)\nβX,Y ×1/\n1×βY,Z\n\nS∗(X × Y ) × S∗(Z)\nβX×Y,Z\n\nS∗(X) × S∗(Y × Z)\nβX,Y ×Z / S∗(X × Y × Z)\ncommutes - and commutative -\nS∗(X) × S∗(Y )\nβX,Y\n/\nT\n\nS∗(X × Y )\nS∗(T)\n\nS∗(Y ) × S∗(X)\nβY,X\n// S∗(X × Y )\ncommutes, where on spaces T(x, y) = (y, x), and on chain complexes T(a, b) = (-1)pq(b, a) when a\nhas degree p and b has degree q.\nWe will see that these properties hold up to chain homotopy for any choice of chain-level cross\nproduct.\nRelative homology\nAn ultimate goal of algebraic topology is to find means to compute the set of homotopy classes\nof maps from one space to another. This is important because many geometrical problems can be\nrephrased as such a computation. It's a lot more modest than wanting to characterize, somehow,\nall continuous maps from X to Y ; but the very fact that it still contains a great deal of interesting\ninformation means that it is still a very challenging problem.\nHomology is in a certain sense the best \"additive\" approximation to this problem; and its ad-\nditivity makes it much more computable. To justify this, we want to describe the sense in which\nhomology is \"additive.\" Here are two related aspects of this claim.\n1. If A ⊆X is a subspace, then H∗(X) a combination of H∗(A) and H∗(X -A).\n2. The homology H∗(A ∪B) is like H∗(A) + H∗(B) -H∗(A ∩B).\nThe first hope is captured by the long exact sequence of a pair, the second by the Mayer-Vietoris\nTheorem. Both facts show that homology behaves like a measure. The precise statement of both\nfacts uses the machinery of exact sequences. I'll use the following language.\nDefinition 8.1. A sequence of abelian groups is a diagram of abelian groups of the form\n· · · →Cn+1\nfn\n-→Cn\nfn-1\n---→Cn-1 →· · · ,\nin which all composites are zero; that is, im fn ⊆ker fn-1 for all n. It is exact at Cn provided that\nthis inequality is an equality.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nA sequence is just another name for a chain complex; it is exact at Cn if and only if Hn(C∗) = 0.\nSo homology measures the failure of exactness.\nExample 8.2. Sequences may be zero for n large or for n small. We may just not write them down\nif all the groups from some point on are zero. For example, 0 →A\ni-→B is exact iffi is injective,\nand B\np-→C →0 is exact iffp is surjective.\nExactness was a key concept in the development of algebraic topology, and \"exact\" is a great\nword for the concept. A foundational treatment [5] of algebraic topology was published by Sammy\nEilenberg and Norman Steenrod in 1952. The story goes that in the galleys for the book they left\na blank space whenever the word representing this concept was used, and filled it in at the last\nminute.\nDefinition 8.3. A short exact sequence is an exact sequence of the form\n0 →A i-→B\np-→C →0 .\nAny sequence of the form A →B →C expands to a diagram\nker(p)\n\"\nA\nO\ni\n/ B\np\n/\n#\nC\ncoker(i)\nO\nIt is exact at B if and only if A\n∼\n=\n-→ker p or, equivalently, coker(i)\n∼\n=\n-→C.\nIt is short exact if\nfurthermore i is injective and p is surjective.\nWe will study the homology of a space X by comparing it to the homology of a subspace A and\na complement or quotient modulo the subspace. Note that S∗(A) injects into S∗(X). This suggests\nconsidering the quotient group\nSn(X)\nSn(A) .\nThis is the group of relative n-chains of the pair (X, A).\nLet's formalize this a bit. Along with the category Top of spaces, we have the category Top2 of\npairs of spaces. An object of Top2 is a space X together with a subspace A. A map (X, A) →(Y, B)\nis a continuous map X →Y that sends A into B.\nThere are four obvious functors relating Top and Top2:\nX 7→(X, ∅) ,\nX 7→(X, X) ,\n(X, A) 7→X ,\n(X, A) 7→A .\nDo the relative chains form themselves into a chain complex?\nLemma 8.4. Let A∗be a subcomplex of the chain complex B∗. There is a unique structure of chain\ncomplex on the quotient graded abelian group C∗with entries Cn = Bn/An such that B∗→C∗is a\nchain map.\n\n9. THE HOMOLOGY LONG EXACT SEQUENCE\nProof. To define d : Cn →Cn-1, represent c ∈Cn by b ∈Bn, and hope that [db] ∈Bn-1/An-1 is\nwell defined. If we replace b by b + a for a ∈An, we find\nd(b + a) = db + da ≡db\nmod An-1 ,\nso our hope is justified. Then d2[b] = [d2b] = 0.\nDefinition 8.5. The relative singular chain complex of the pair (X, A) is\nS∗(X, A) = S∗(X)\nS∗(A) .\nThis is a functor from pairs of spaces to chain complexes. Of course\nS∗(X, ∅) = S∗(X) ,\nS∗(X, X) = 0 .\nDefinition 8.6. The relative singular homology of the pair (X, A) is the homology of the relative\nsingular chain complex:\nHn(X, A) = Hn(S∗(X, A)) .\nOne of the nice features of the absolute chain group Sn(X) is that it is free as an abelian group.\nThis is also the case for its quotent Sn(X, A), since the map Sn(A) →Sn(X) takes basis elements\nto basis elements. Sn(X, A) is freely generated by the n-simplices in X that do not lie entirely in\nA.\nExample 8.7. Consider ∆n, relative to its boundary\n∂∆n :=\n[\nim di ∼= Sn-1 .\nWe have the identity map ιn : ∆n →∆n, the universal n-simplex, in Sinn(∆n) ⊆Sn(∆n). It is not\na cycle; its boundary dιn ∈Sn-1(∆n) is the alternating sum of the faces of the n-simplex. Each\nof these singular simplices lies in ∂∆n, so dιn ∈Sn-1(∂∆n), and [ιn] ∈Sn(∆n, ∂∆n) is a relative\ncycle. We will see that the relative homology Hn(∆n, ∂∆n) is infinite cyclic, with generator [ιn].\nThe homology long exact sequence\nA pair of spaces (X, A) gives rise to a short exact sequence of chain complexes:\n0 →S∗(A) →S∗(X) →S∗(X, A) →0 .\nIn homology, this will relate H∗(A), H∗(X), and H∗(X, A).\nTo investigate what happens, let's suppse we have a general short exact sequence of chain\ncomplexes,\n0 →A∗→B∗→C∗→0 ,\nand study what happens in homology. Clearly the composite H∗(A) →H∗(B) →H∗(C) is trivial.\nIs this sequence exact? Let [b] ∈Hn(B) such that g([b]) = 0. It's determined by some b ∈Bn\nsuch that d(b) = 0. If g([b]) = 0, then there is some c ∈Cn+1 such that dc = gb. Now, g is\nsurjective, so there is some b ∈Bn+1 such that g(b) = c. Then we can consider db ∈Bn, and\ng(d(b)) = d(c) ∈Cn. What is b -db? This maps to zero in Cn, so by exactness there is some\na ∈An such that f(a) = b -db. Is a a cycle? Well, f(da) = d(fa) = d(b -db) = db -d2b = db,\nbut we assumed that db = 0, so f(da) = 0. This means that da is zero because f is an injection by\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nexactness. Therefore a is a cycle. What is [a] ∈Hn(A)? Well, f([a]) = [b -db] = [b]. This proves\nexactness of Hn(A) →Hn(B) →Hn(C).\nOn the other hand, H∗(A) →H∗(B) may fail to be injective, and H∗(B) →H∗(C) may fail to\nbe surjective. Instead:\nTheorem 9.1 (The homology long exact sequence). Let 0 →A∗→B∗→C∗→0 be a short exact\nsequence of chain complexes. Then there is a natural homomorphism ∂: Hn(C) →Hn-1(A) such\nthat the sequence\n· · ·\n/ Hn+1(C)\n∂\nt\nHn(A)\n/ Hn(B)\n/ Hn(C)\n∂\nt\nHn-1(A)\n/ · · ·\nis exact.\nProof. We'll construct ∂, and leave the rest as an exercise. Here's an expanded part of this short\nexact sequence:\n/ An+1\nf\n/\nd\n\nBn+1\ng\n/\nd\n\nCn+1\n/\nd\n\n/ An\nf\n/\nd\n\nBn\ng\n/\nd\n\nCn\n/\nd\n\n/ An-1\nf\n/ Bn-1\ng\n/ Cn-1\n/ 0\nLet c ∈Cn be a cycle: dc = 0. The map g is surjective, so pick a b ∈Bn such that g(b) = c, and\nconsider db ∈Bn-1. Well, g(d(b)) = d(g(b)) = dc = 0. So by exactness, there is some a ∈An-1\nsuch that f(a) = db. How many choices are there of picking a? Only one, because f is injective.\nWe need to check that a is a cycle. What is d(a)? Well, d2b = 0, so da maps to 0 under f. But\nbecause f is injective, da = 0, i.e., a is a cycle. This means we can define ∂[c] = [a].\nTo make sure that this is well-defined, let's make sure that this choice of homology class a didn't\ndepend on the b that we chose. Pick some other b′ such that g(b′) = c. Then there is a′ ∈An-1\nsuch that f(a′) = db′. We want a -a′ to be a boundary, so that [a] = [a′]. We want a ∈An such\nthat da = a -a′. Well, g(b -b′) = 0, so by exactness, there is a ∈An such that f(a) = b -b′. What\nis da? Well, da = d(b -b′) = db -db′. But f(a -a′) = b -b′, so because f is injective, da = a -a′,\ni.e., [a] = [a′]. I leave the rest of what needs checking to the listener.\nExample 9.2. A pair of spaces (X, A) gives rise to a natural long exact sequence in homology:\n· · ·\n/ Hn+1(X, A)\n∂\nt\nHn(A)\n/ Hn(X)\n/ Hn(X, A)\n∂\nt\nHn-1(A)\n/ · · ·\n.\n\n9. THE HOMOLOGY LONG EXACT SEQUENCE\nExample 9.3. Let's think again about the pair (Dn, Sn-1). By homotopy invariance we know that\nHq(Dn) = 0 for q > 0, since Dn is contractible. So\n∂: Hq(Dn, Sn-1) →Hq-1(Sn-1)\nis an isomorphism for q > 1. The bottom of the long exact sequence looks like this:\n/ H1(Dn, Sn-1)\ns\nH0(Sn-1)\n/ H0(Dn)\n/ H0(Dn, Sn-1)\n/ 0\nWhen n > 1, both Sn-1 and Dn are path-connected, so the map H0(Sn-1) →H0(Dn) is an\nisomorphism, and\nH1(Dn, Sn-1) = H0(Dn, Sn-1) = 0 .\nWhen n = 1, we discover that\nH1(D1, S0) = Z\nand\nH0(D1, S0) = 0 .\nThe generator of H1(D1, S0) is represented by any 1-simplex ι1 : ∆1 →D1 such that d0ι = c0\nand d1ι = c0\n0 (or vice versa). To go any further in this analysis, we'll need another tool, known as\n\"excision.\"\nWe can set this up for reduced homology (as in Lecture 5) as well. Note that any map induces\nan isomorphism in eS-1, so to a pair (X, A) we can associate a short exact sequence\n0 →eS∗(A) →eS∗(X) →S∗(X, A) →0\nand hence a long exact sequence\n· · ·\n/ Hn+1(X, A)\n∂\nt\neHn(A)\n/ eHn(X)\n/ Hn(X, A)\n∂\nt\neHn-1(A)\n/ · · ·\n.\nIn the example (Dn, Sn-1), eH∗(Dn) = 0 and so\n∂: Hq(Dn, Sn-1)\n∼\n=\n-→eHq-1(Sn-1)\nfor all n and q. This even works when n = 0; remember that S-1 = ∅and eH-1(∅) = Z. This is\nwhy I like this convention.\nThe homology long exact sequence is often used in conjunction with an elementary fact about\na map between exact sequences known as the five lemma. Suppose you have two exact sequences\nof abelian groups and a map between them - a \"ladder\":\nA4\nd\n/\nf4\n\nA3\nd\n/\nf3\n\nA2\nd\n/\nf2\n\nA1\nd\n/\nf1\n\nA0\nf0\n\nB4\nd\n/ B3\nd\n/ B2\nd\n/ B1\nd\n/ B0\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nWhen can we guarantee that the middle map f2 is an isomorphism? We're going to \"diagram chase.\"\nJust follow your nose, making assumptions as necessary.\nSurjectivity: Let b2 ∈B2. We want to show that there is something in A2 mapping to b2.\nWe can consider db2 ∈B1. Let's assume that f1 is surjective. Then there's a1 ∈A1 such that\nf1(a1) = db2.\nWhat is da1?\nWell, f0(da1) = d(f1(a1)) = d(db) = 0.\nSo we want f0 to be\ninjective. Then da1 is zero, so by exactness of the top sequence, there is some a2 ∈A2 such that\nda2 = a1. What is f2(a2)? To answer this, begin by asking: What is d(f2(a2))? By commutativity,\nd(f2(a2)) = f1(d(a2)) = f1(a1) = db2. Let's consider b2 -f2(a2). This maps to zero under d. So by\nexactness, there is b3 ∈B3 such that d(b3) = b2 -f2(a2). If we assume that f3 is surjective, then\nthere is a3 ∈A3 such that f3(a3) = b3. But now d(a3) ∈A2, and f2(d(a3)) = d(f3(a3)) = b2-f2(a2).\nThis means that b2 = f(a2 + d(a3)), verifying surjectivity of f2.\nThis proves the first half of the following important fact. The second half is \"dual\" to the first.\nProposition 9.4 (Five lemma). In the map of exact sequences above,\n- If f0 is injective and f1 and f3 are surjective, then f2 is surjective.\n- If f4 is surjective and f3 and f1 are injective, then f2 is injective.\nVery commonly one knows that f0, f1, f3, and f4 are all isomorphisms, and concludes that f2 is\nalso an isomorphism. For example:\nCorollary 9.5. Let\n/ A′\n∗\n/\nf\n\nB′\n∗\n/\ng\n\nC′\n∗\n/\nh\n\n/ A∗\n/ B∗\n/ C∗\n/ 0\nbe a map of short exact sequences of chain complexes. If two of the three maps induced in homology\nby f, g, and h are isomorphisms, then so is the third.\nHere's an application.\nProposition 9.6. Let (A, X) →(B, Y ) be a map of pairs, and assume that two of A →B, X →Y ,\nand (X, A) →(Y, B) induce isomorphims in homology. Then the third one does as well.\nProof. Just apply the five lemma to the map between the two homology long exact sequences.\nExcision and applications\nWe have found two general properties of singular homology: homotopy invariance and the long\nexact sequence of a pair. We also claimed that H∗(X, A) \"depends only on X -A.\" You have to\nbe careful about this. The following definition gives conditions that will capture the sense in which\nthe relative homology of a pair (X, A) depends only on the complement of A in X.\nDefinition 10.1. A triple (X, A, U) where U ⊆A ⊆X, is excisive if U ⊆Int(A). The inclusion\n(X -U, A -U) ⊆(X, A) is then called an excision.\nTheorem 10.2. An excision induces an isomorphism in homology,\nH∗(X -U, A -U)\n∼\n=\n-→H∗(X, A) .\n\n10. EXCISION AND APPLICATIONS\nSo you can cut out closed bits of the interior of A without changing the relative homology. The\nproof will take us a couple of days. Before we give applications, let me pose a different way to\ninterpret the motto \"H∗(X, A) depends only on X -A.\" Collapsing the subspace A to a point gives\nus a map of pairs\n(X, A) →(X/A, ∗) .\nWhen does this map induce an isomorphism in homology? Excision has the following consequence.\nCorollary 10.3. Assume that there is a subspace B of X such that (1) A ⊆IntB and (2) A →B\nis a deformation retract. Then\nH∗(X, A) →H∗(X/A, ∗)\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. The diagram of pairs\n(X, A)\n\ni\n/ (X, B)\n\n(X -A, B -A)\nk\n\nj\no\n(X/A, ∗)\nı\n/ (X/A, B/A)\n(X/A -∗, B/A -∗)\n\no\ncommutes. We want the left vertical to be a homology isomorphism, and will show that the rest of\nthe perimeter consists of homology isomorphisms. The map k is a homeomorphism of pairs while j\nis an excision by assumption (1). The map i induces an isomorphism in homology by assumption\n(2), the long exact sequences, and the five-lemma. Since I is a compact Hausdorffspace, the map\nB × I →B/A × I is again a quotient map, so the deformation B × I →B, which restricts to the\nconstant deformation on A, descends to show that ∗→B/A is a deformation retract. So the map\nı is also a homology isomorphism. Finally, ∗⊆Int(B/A) in X/A, by definition of the quotient\ntopology, so induces an isomorphism by excision.\nNow what are some consequences? For a start, we'll finally get around to computing the ho-\nmology of the sphere. It happens simultaneously with a computation of H∗(Dn, Sn-1). (Note that\nS-1 = ∅.) To describe generators, for each n ≥0 pick a homeomorphism\n(∆n, ∂∆n) →(Dn, Sn-1) ,\nand write\nιn ∈Sn(Dn, Sn-1)\nfor the corresponding relative n-chain.\nProposition 10.4. Let n > 0 and let ∗∈Sn-1 be any point. Then:\nHq(Sn) =\n\nZ = ⟨[∂ιn+1]⟩\nif\nq = n > 0\nZ = ⟨[c0\n∗]⟩\nif\nq = 0, n > 0\nZ ⊕Z = ⟨[c0\n∗], [∂ι1]⟩\nif\nq = n = 0\notherwise\nand\nHq(Dn, Sn-1) =\n(\nZ = ⟨[ιn]⟩\nif\nq = n\notherwise .\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nProof. The division into cases for Hq(Sn) can be eased by employing reduced homology. Then the\nclaim is merely that for n ≥0\neHq(Sn-1) =\n(\nZ\nif\nq = n -1\nif\nq = n -1\nand the map\n∂: Hq(Dn, Sn-1) →eHq-1(Sn-1)\nis an isomorphism. The second statement follows from the long exact sequence in reduced homology\ntogether with the fact that eH∗(Dn) = 0 since Dn is contractible. The first uses induction and the\npair of isomorphisms\neHq-1(Sn-1)\n∼\n=\n←-Hq(Dn, Sn-1)\n∼\n=\n-→Hq(Dn/Sn-1, ∗)\nsince Dn/Sn-1 ∼= Sn. The right hand arrow is an isomorphism since Sn-1 is a deformation retract\nof a neighborhood in Dn.\nWhy should you care about this complicated homology calculation?\nCorollary 10.5. If m = n, then Sm and Sn are not homotopy equivalent.\nProof. Their homology groups are not isomorphic.\nCorollary 10.6. If m = n, then Rm and Rn are not homeomorphic.\nProof. If m or n is zero, this is clear, so let m, n > 0. Assume we have a homeomorphism f : Rm →\nRn. This restricts to a homeomorphism Rm -{0} →Rn -{f(0)}. But these spaces are homotopy\nequivalent to spheres of different dimension.\nTheorem 10.7 (Brouwer fixed-point theorem). If f : Dn →Dn is continuous, then there is some\npoint x ∈Dn such that f(x) = x.\nProof. Suppose not. Then you can draw a ray from f(x) through x. It meets the boundary of Dn\nat a point g(x) ∈Sn-1. Check that g : Dn →Sn-1 is continuous. If x is on the boundary, then\nx = g(x), so g provides a factorization of the identity map on Sn-1 through Dn. This is inconsistent\nwith our computation because the identity map induces the identity map on eHn-1(Sn-1) ∼= Z, while\neHn-1(Dn) = 0.\n\n11. THE EILENBERG STEENROD AXIOMS AND THE LOCALITY PRINCIPLE\nOur computation of the homology of a sphere also implies that there are many non-homotopic\nself-maps of Sn, for any n ≥1.\nWe will distinguish them by means of the \"degree\": A map\nf : Sn →Sn induces an endomorphism of the infinite cyclic group Hn(Sn). Any endomorphism\nof an infinite cyclic group is given by multiplication by an integer. This integer is well defined\n(independent of a choice of basis), and any integer occurs. Thus End(Z) = Z×, the monoid of\nintegers under multiplication. The homotopy classes of self-maps of Sn also form a monoid, under\ncomposition, and:\nTheorem 10.8. Let n ≥1. The degree map provides us with a surjective monoid homomorphism\ndeg : [Sn, Sn] →Z× .\nProof. Degree is multiplicative by functoriality of homology.\nWe construct a map of degree k on Sn by induction on n. If n = 1, this is just the winding\nnumber; an example is given by regarding S1 as unit complex numbers and sending z to zk. The\nproof that this has degree k is an exercise.\nSuppose we've constructed a map fk : Sn-1 →Sn-1 of degree k. Extend it to a map fk : Dn →\nDn by defining fk(tx) = tfk(x) for t ∈[0, 1]. We may then collapse the sphere to a point and\nidentify the quotient with Sn. This gives us a new map gk : Sn →Sn making the diagram below\ncommute.\nHn-1(Sn-1)\nfk∗\n\nHn(Dn, Sn-1)\n∼\n=\no\n∼\n=\n/\n\nHn(Sn)\ngk∗\n\nHn-1(Sn-1)\nHn(Dn, Sn-1)\n∼\n=\no\n∼\n=\n/ Hn(Sn)\nThe horizontal maps are isomorphisms, so deg gk = k as well.\nWe will see (in 18.906) that this map is in fact an isomorphism.\nThe Eilenberg Steenrod axioms and the locality principle\nBefore we proceed to prove the excision theorem, let's review the properties ofsingular homology\nas we have developed them. They are captured by a set of axioms, due to Sammy Eilenberg and\nNorman Steenrod [5].\nDefinition 11.1. A homology theory (on Top) is:\n- a sequence of functors hn : Top2 →Ab for all n ∈Z and\n- a sequence of natural transformations ∂: hn(X, A) →hn-1(A, ∅)\nsuch that:\n- If f0, f1 : (X, A) →(Y, B) are homotopic, then f0∗= f1∗: hn(X, A) →hn(Y, B).\n- Excisions induce isomorphisms.\n- For any pair (X, A), the sequence\n· · · →hq+1(X, A) ∂-→hq(A) →hq(X) →hq(X, A) ∂-→· · ·\nis exact, where we have written hq(X) for hq(X, ∅).\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\n- (The dimension axiom): The group hn(∗) is nonzero only for n = 0.\nWe add the following \"Milnor axiom\" [8] to our definition. To state it, let I be a set and suppose\nthat for each i ∈I we have a space Xi. We can form their disjoint union or coproduct ` Xi. The\ninclusion maps Xi →` Xi induce maps hn(Xi) →hn(` Xi), and these in turn induce a map from\nthe direct sum, or coproduct in Ab:\nα :\nM\ni∈I\nhn(Xi) →hn\na\ni∈I\nXi\n!\n.\nThen:\n- The map α is an isomorphism for all n.\nOrdinary singular homology satisfies these, with h0(∗) = Z. We will soon add \"coefficents\" to\nhomology, producing a homology theory whose value on a point is any prescribed abelian group.\nIn later developments, it emerges that the dimension axiom is rather like the parallel postulate in\nEuclidean geometry: it's \"obvious,\" but, as it turns out, the remaining axioms accomodate extremely\ninteresting alternatives, in which hn(∗) is nonzero for infinitely many values of n (both positive and\nnegative).\nExcision is a statement that homology is \"localizable.\"\nTo make this precise, we need some\ndefinitions.\nDefinition 11.2. Let X be a topological space. A family A of subsets of X is a cover if X is the\nunion of the interiors of elements of A.\nDefinition 11.3. Let A be a cover of X. An n-simplex σ is A-small if there is A ∈A such that\nthe image of σ is entirely in A.\nNotice that if σ : ∆n →X is A-small, then so is diσ; in fact, for any simplicial operator φ,\nφ∗σ is again A-small. Let's denote by SinA\n∗(X) the graded set of A-small simplices. This us a\nsub-simplicial set of Sin∗(X). Applying the free abelian group functor, we get the subcomplex\nSA\n∗(X)\nof A-small singular chains. Write HA\n∗(X) for its homology.\nTheorem 11.4 (The locality principle). The inclusion SA\n∗(X) ⊆S∗(X) induces an isomorphism\nin homology, HA\n∗(X)\n∼\n=\n-→H∗(X).\nThis will take a little time to prove. Let's see right now how it implies excision.\nSuppose X ⊃A ⊃U is excisive, so that U ⊆IntA, or Int(X -U) ∪IntA = X. This if we let\nB = X -U, then A = {A, B} is a cover of X. Rewriting in terms of B,\n(X -U, A -U) = (B, A ∩B) ,\nso we aim to show that\nS∗(B, A ∩B) →S∗(X, A)\n\n11.

We have the following diagram of chain complexes with exact\nrows:\n/ S∗(A)\n=\n\n/ SA\n∗(X)\n\n/ SA\n∗(X)/S∗(A)\n\n/ 0\n/ S∗(A)\n/ S∗(X)\n/ S∗(X, A)\n/ 0\nThe middle vertical induces an isomorphism in homology by the locality principle, so the homology\nlong exact sequences combine with the five-lemma to show that the right hand vertical is also a\nhomology isomorphism. But\nSA\nn (X) = Sn(A) + Sn(B) ⊆Sn(X)\nand a simple result about abelian groups provides an isomorphism\nSn(B)\nSn(A ∩B) =\nSn(B)\nSn(A) ∩Sn(B)\n∼\n=\n-→Sn(A) + Sn(B)\nSn(A)\n= SA\nn (X)\nSn(A) ,\nso excision follows.\nThis case of a cover with two elements leads to another expression of excision, known as the\n\"Mayer-Vietoris sequence.\" In describing it we will use the following notation for the various inclu-\nsion.\nA ∩B\nj1\n/\nj2\n\nA\ni1\n\nB\ni2\n/ X\nTheorem 11.5 (Mayer-Vietoris).

The key is\na process of subdivision of singular simplices. It will use the \"cone construction\" b∗from Lecture 5.\nThe cone construction dealt with a region X in Euclidean space, star-shaped with respect to b ∈X,\nand gave a chain-homotopy between the identity and the \"constant map\" on S∗(X):\ndb ∗+b ∗d = 1 -ηε\nwhere ε : S∗(X) →Z is the augmentation and η : Z →S∗(X) sends 1 to the constant 0-chain c0\nb.\nLet's see how the cone construction can be used to \"subdivide\" an \"affine simplex.\" An affine\nsimplex is the convex hull of a finite set of points in Euclidean space. To make this non-degenerate,\nassume that the points v0, v1, . . . , vn, have the property that {v1 -v0, . . . , vn -b0} is linearly inde-\npendent. The barycenter of this simplex is the center of mass of the vertices,\nb =\nn + 1\nX\nvi .\nStart with n = 1. To subdivide a 1-simplex, just cut it in half. For the 2-simplex, look at the\nsubdivision of each face, and form the cone of them with the barycenter of the 2-simplex. This gives\nus a decomposition of the 2-simplex into six sub-simplices.\n\n12. SUBDIVISION\nWe want to formalize this process, and extend it to singular simplices (using naturality, of\ncourse). Define a natural transformation\n$ : Sn(X) →Sn(X)\nby defining it on standard n-simplex, namely by specifying what $(ιn) is where ιn : ∆n →∆n is the\nuniversal n-simplex, and then extending by naturality:\n$(σ) = σ∗$(ιn) .\nHere's the definition. When n = 0, define $ to be the identity; i.e., $ι0 = ι0. For n > 0, define\n$ιn := bn ∗$dιn\nwhere bn is the barycenter of ∆n. This makes a lot of sense if you draw out a picture, and it's a\nvery clever definition that captures the geometry we described.\nThe dollar sign symbol is a little odd, but consider: it derives from the symbol for the Spanish\npiece of eight, which was meant to be subdivided (so for example two bits is a quarter).\nHere's what we'll prove.\nProposition 12.1. $ is a natural chain map S∗(X) →S∗(X) that is naturally chain-homotopic to\nthe identity.\nProof. Let's begin by proving that it's a chain map. We'll use induction on n. It's enough to show\nthat d$ιn = $dιn, because then, for any n-simplex σ,\nd$σ = d$σ∗ιn = σ∗d$ιn = σ∗$dιn = $dσ∗ιn = $dσ .\nDimension zero is easy: since S-1 = 0, d$ι0 and $dι0 are both zero and hence equal.\nFor n ≥1, we want to compute d$ιn. This is:\nd$ιn = d(bn ∗$dιn)\n= (1 -ηbε -bn ∗d)($dιn)\nWhat happens when n = 1? Well,\nηbε$dι1 = ηbε$(c0\n1 -c0\n0) = ηbε(c0\n1 -c0\n0) = 0 ,\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nsince ε takes sums of coefficients. So the ηbε term drops out for any n ≥1. Let's continue, using\nthe inductive hypothesis:\nd$ιn = (1 -bn ∗d)($dιn)\n= $dιn -bn ∗d$dιn\n= $dιn -bn$d2ιn\n= $dιn\nbecause d2 = 0.\nTo define the chain homotopy T, we'll just write down a formula and not try to justify it. Making\nuse of naturality, we just need to define Tιn. Here it is:\nTιn = bn ∗($ιn -ιn -Tdιn) ∈Sn+1(∆n) .\nOnce again, we're going to check that T is a chain homotopy by induction, and, again, we need to\ncheck only on the universal case.\nWhen n = 0, the formula gives Tι0 = 0 (which starts the inductive definition!) so it's true that\ndTι0 -Tdι0 = $ι0 -ι0. Now let's assume that dTc -Tdc = $c -c for every (n -1)-chain c. Let's\nstart by computing dTιn:\ndTιn = dn(bn ∗($ιn -ιn -Tdιn))\n= (1 -bn ∗d)($ιn -ιn -Tdιn)\n= $ιn -ιn -Tdιn -bn ∗(d$ιn -dιn -dTdιn)\nAll we want now is that bn∗(d$ιn-dιn-dTdιn) = 0. We can do this using the inductive hypothesis,\nbecause dιn is in dimension n -1.\ndTdιn = -Td(dιn) + $dιn -dιn\n= $dιn -dιn\n= d$ιn -dιn .\nThis means that d$ιn -dιn -dTdιn = 0, so T is indeed a chain homotopy.\nProof of the Locality Principle\nWe have constructed the subdivision operator $ : S∗(X) →S∗(X), with the idea that it will shrink\nchains and by iteration eventually render any chain A-small. Does $ succeed in making simplices\nsmaller? Let's look first at the affine case. Recall that the \"diameter\" of a subset X of a metric\nspace is given by\ndiam(X) = sup{d(x, y) : x, y ∈X} .\nLemma 13.1. Let σ be an affine n-simplex, and τ a simplex in $σ. Then diam(τ) ≤\nn\nn+1diam(σ).\nProof. Suppose that the vertices of σ are v0, v1, . . . , vn. Let b be the barycenter of σ, and write the\nvertices of τ as w0 = b, w1, . . . , wn. We want to estimate |wi -wj|. First, compute\n|b -vi| =\n\nv0 + · · · + vn -(n + 1)vi\nn + 1\n=\n\n(v0 -vi) + (v1 -vi) + · · · + (vn -vi)\nn + 1\n.\n\n13. PROOF OF THE LOCALITY PRINCIPLE\nOne of the terms in the numerator is zero, so we can continue:\n|b -vi| ≤\nn\nn + 1 max\ni,j |vi -vj| =\nn\nn + 1diam(σ)\nSince wi ∈σ,\n|b -wi| ≤max\ni\n|b -vi| ≤\nn\nn + 1diam(σ) .\nFor the other cases, we use induction:\n|wi -wj| ≤diam(simplex in $dσ) ≤n -1\nn\ndiam(dσ) ≤\nn\nn + 1diam(σ) .\nNow let's transfer this calculation to singular simplices in a space X equipped with a cover A.\nLemma 13.2. For any singular chain c, some iterate of the subdivision operator sends c to an\nA-small chain.\nProof. We may assume that c is a single simplex σ : ∆n →X, because in general you just take the\nlargest of the iterates of $ needed to send the simplices in c to a A-small chains. We now encounter\nanother of the great virtues of singular homology: we pull A back to a cover of the standard simplex.\nDefine an open cover of ∆n by\nU := {σ-1(Int(A)) : A ∈A} .\nThe space ∆n is a compact metric space, and so is subject to the Lebesgue covering lemma, which\nwe apply to the open cover U.\nLemma 13.3 (Lebesgue covering lemma). Let M be a compact metric space, and let U be an open\ncover. Then there is ε > 0 such that for all x ∈M, Bε(x) ⊆U for some U ∈U.\nTo apply this, we will have to understand iterates of the subdivision operator.\nLemma 13.4. For any k ≥1, $k ≃1 : S∗(X) →S∗(X).\nProof. We construct Tk such that dTk+Tkd = $k-1. To begin, we take T1 = T, since dT+Td = $-1.\nLet's apply $ to this equation. We get $dT + $Td = $2 -$. Sum up these two equations to get\ndT + Td + $dT + $Td = $2 -1 ,\nwhich simplifies to\nd($ + 1)T + ($ + 1)Td = $2 -1\nsince $d = d$.\nSo define T2 = ($ + 1)T. Continuing, you see that we can define\nTk = ($k-1 + $k-2 + · · · + 1)T .\nWe are now in position to prove the Locality Principle, which we recall:\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nTheorem 13.5 (The locality principle). Let A be a cover of a space X. The inclusion SA\n∗(X) ⊆\nS∗(X) is a quasi-isomorphism; that is, HA\n∗(X) →H∗(X) is an isomorphism.\nProof. To prove surjectivity let c be an n-cycle in X. We want to find an A-small n-cycle that is\nhomologous to c. There's only one thing to do. Pick k such that $kc is A-small. This is a cycle\nbecause because $k is a chain map. I want to compare this new cycle with c. That's what the chain\nhomotopy Tk is designed for:\n$kc -c = dTkc + Tkdc = dTkc\nsince c is a cycle. So $kc and c are homologous.\nNow for injectivity. Suppose c is a cycle in SA\nn (X) such that c = db for some b ∈Sn+1(X). We\nwant c to be a boundary of an A-small chain. Use the chain homotopy Tk again: Suppose that k is\nsuch that $kc is A-small. Compute:\nd$kb -c = d($k -1)b = d(dTk + Tkd)b = dTkc\nso\nc = d$kb -dTkc = d($kb -Tkc) .\nNow, $kb is A-small, by choice of k. Is Tkc also A-small? I claim that it is. Why? It is enough\nto show that Tkσ is A-small if σ is. We know that σ = σ∗ιn. Because σ is A-small, we know that\nσ : ∆n →X is the composition i∗σ where σ : ∆n →A and i : A →X is the inclusion of some\nA ∈A. By naturality, then, Tkσ = Tki∗σ = i∗Tkσ, which certainly is A-small.\nThis completes the proof of the Eilenberg Steenrod axioms for singular homology. In the next\nchapter, we will develop a variety of practical tools, using these axioms to compute the singular\nhomology of many spaces.\n\n13. PROOF OF THE LOCALITY PRINCIPLE\nLefschetz progeny\nAccording to the Mathematical Genealogy Project, Solomon Lefschetz had 9312 academic descendents as of March 2018. Here are just a\nfew, with special attention to MIT faculty (marked with an asterisk).\nSolomon Lefschetz\nNorman Steenrod\nRalph Fox\nAlbert Tucker\nFrank Peterson∗\nGeorge Whitehead∗\nEdgar Brown\nBarry Mazur\nJohn Milnor∗\nMarvin Minsky∗\nJohn Nash∗\nDavid Anick∗\nJohn Moore\nRalph Cohen\nNoam Elkes\nSilvio Micali∗\nManuel Blum\nPatrick Winston∗\nPeter May\nWilliam Browder\nHaynes Miller∗\nHenry Cohn*\nAbhinav Kumar*\nBonnie Burger∗\nGary Lee Miller\nMike Sipser∗\nMark Behrens∗\nDennis Sullivan∗\nGeorge Lusztig∗\nTom Leighton∗\nDan Spielman∗\nAndrew Sutherland∗\nCurt McMullen\nHal Abelson∗\nPeter Shor∗\nAnkur Moitra∗\n\nChapter 2\nComputational methods\nCW-complexes\nThere are various ways to model geometrically interesting spaces. Manifolds provide one important\nmodel, well suited to analysis. Another model, one we have not talked about, is given by simplicial\ncomplexes. It's very combinatorial, and constructing a simplicial complex model for a given space\ninvolves making a lot of choices that are combinatorial rather than topological in character. A\nmore flexible model, one more closely reflecting topological information, is given by the theory of\nCW-complexes.\nIn building up a space as a CW-complex, we will successively \"glue\" cells onto what has been\nalready built. This is a general construction.\nSuppose we have a pair (B, A), and a map f : A →X. Define a space X ∪f B (or X ∪A B) in\nthe diagram\nA\nf\n/\n_\n\nX\n\nB\n/ X ∪f B\nby\nX ∪f B = X ⊔B/ ∼\nwhere the equivalence relation is generated by requiring that a ∼f(a) for all a ∈A. We say that\nwe have \"attached B to X along f (or along A).\"\nThere are two kinds of equivalence classes in X ∪f B: (1) singletons containing elements of\nB -A, and (2) {x} ⊔f-1(x) for x ∈X. The topology on X ∪f B is the quotient topology, and is\ncharacterized by a universal property: any solid-arrow commutative diagram\nA\nf\n/\n_\n\nX\nj\n\nj\n\nB\n/\ng\n)\nX ∪f B\n# Y\ncan be uniquely filled in. It's a \"push-out.\"\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nExample 14.1. If X = ∗, then ∗∪f B = B/A.\nExample 14.2. If A = ∅, then X ∪f B is the coproduct X ⊔B.\nExample 14.3. If both,\nB/∅= ∗∪∅B = ∗⊔B .\nFor example, ∅/∅= ∗. This is creation from nothing. We won't get into the religious ramifications.\nExample 14.4 (Attaching a cell). A basic collection of pairs of spaces is given by the disks relative\nto their boundaries: (Dn, Sn-1). (Recall that S-1 = ∅.) In this context, Dn is called an \"n-cell,\"\nand a map f : Sn-1 →X allows us to attach an n-cell to X, to form\nSn-1\nf\n/\n_\n\nX\n\nDn\n/ X ∪f Dn\nYou might want to generalize this a little bit, and attach a bunch of n-cells all at once:\n`\nα∈A Sn-1\nα\nf\n/\n_\n\nX\n\n`\nα∈A Dn\nα\n/ X ∪f\n`\nα∈A Dn\nα\nWhat are some examples? When n = 0, (D0, S-1) = (∗, ∅), so you are just adding a discrete\nset to X:\nX ∪f\na\nα∈A\nD0 = X ⊔A\nMore interesting: Let's attach two 1-cells to a point:\nS0 ⊔S0\nf\n/\n_\n\n∗\n\nD1 ⊔D1\n/ ∗∪f (D1 ⊔D1)\nAgain there's just one choice for f, and ∗∪f (D1 ⊔D1) is a figure 8, because you start with two\n1-disks and identify the four boundary points together. Let me write S1 ∨S1 for this space. We\ncan go on and attach a single 2-cell to manufacture a torus. Think of the figure 8 as the perimeter\nof a square with opposite sides identified.\n\n14. CW-COMPLEXES\nThe inside of the square is a 2-cell, attached to the perimeter by a map I'll denote by aba-1b-1:\nS1\naba-1b-1 /\n_\n\nS1 ∨S1\n\nD2\n/ (S1 ∨S1) ∪f D2 = T 2 .\nThis example illuminates the following definition.\nDefinition 14.5. A CW-complex is a space X equipped with a sequence of subspaces\n∅= Sk-1X ⊆Sk0X ⊆Sk1X ⊆· · · ⊆X\nsuch that\n- X is the union of the SknX's, and\n- for all n, there is a pushout diagram like this:\n`\nα∈An Sn-1\nα\nfn /\n_\n\nSkn-1X\n\n`\nα∈An Dn\nα\ngn\n/ SknX\n.\nThe subspace SknX is the n-skeleton of X.\nSometimes it's convenent to use the alternate\nnotation Xn for the n-skeleton. The first condition is intended topologically, so that a subset of X\nis open if and only if its intersection with each SknX is open; or, equivalently, a map f : X →Y is\ncontinuous if and only if its restriction to each SknX is continuous. The maps fn are the attaching\nmaps and the maps gn are characteristic maps.\nExample 14.6. We just constructed the torus as a CW complex with Sk0T 2 = ∗, Sk1T 2 = S1 ∨S1,\nand Sk2T 2 = T 2.\nDefinition 14.7. A CW-complex is finite-dimensional if SknX = X for some n; of finite type if\neach An is finite, i.e., finitely many cell in each dimension; and finite if it's finite-dimensional and\nof finite type.\nThe dimension of a CW complex is the largest n for which there are n-cells. This is not obviously\na topological invariant, but, have no fear, it turns out that it is.\nIn \"CW,\" the \"C\" is for cell, and the \"W\" is for weak, because of the topology on a CW-complex.\nThis definition is due to J. H. C. Whitehead. Here are a couple of important facts about them.\nTheorem 14.8. Any CW-complex is Hausdorff, and it's compact if and only if it's finite.\nAny compact smooth manifold admits a CW structure.\nProof. See [2] Prop. IV.8.1, [6] Prop. A.3.\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nCW-complexes II\nWe have a few more general things to say about CW complexes.\nSuppose X is a CW complex, with skeleton filtration ∅= X-1 ⊆X0 ⊆X1 ⊆· · · ⊆X and cell\nstructure\n`\nα∈An Sn-1\nα\nfn /\n_\n\nXn-1\n\n`\nα∈An Dn\nα\ngn\n/ Xn\n.\nIn each case, the boundary of a cell gets identified with part of the previous skeleton, but the\n\"interior\"\nIntDn = {x ∈Dn : |x| < 1}\ndoes not. (Note that IntD0 = D0.) Thus as sets - ignoring the topology -\nX =\na\nn≥0\na\nα∈An\nInt(Dn\nα) .\nThe subsets IntDn\nα are called \"open n-cells,\" despite the fact that they not generally open in the\ntopology on X, and (except when n = 0) they are not homeomorphic to compact disks.\nDefinition 15.1. Let X be a CW-complex with a cell structure {gα : Dn\nα →Xn : α ∈An, n ≥0}.\nA subcomplex is a subspace Y ⊆X such that for all n, there is a subset Bn of An such that\nYn = Y ∩Xn provides Y with a CW-structure with characteristic maps {gβ : β ∈Bn, n ≥0}.\nExample 15.2. SknX ⊆X is a subcomplex.\nProposition 15.3. Let X be a CW-complex with a chosen cell structure. Any compact subspace of\nX lies in some finite subcomplex.\nProof. See [2], p. 196.\nRemark 15.4. For fixed cell structures, unions and intersections of subcomplexes are subcomplexes.\nThe n-sphere Sn (for n > 0) admits a very simple CW structure: Let ∗= Sk0(Sn) = Sk1(Sn) =\n· · · = Skn-1(Sn), and attach an n-cell using the unique map Sn-1 →∗. This is a minimal CW\nstructure - you need at least two cells to build Sn.\nThis is great - much simpler than the simplest construction of Sn as a simplicial complex - but\nit is not ideal for all applications. Here's another CW-structure on Sn. Regard Sn ⊆Rn+1, filter\nthe Euclidean space by leading subspaces\nRk = ⟨e1, . . . , ek⟩.\nand define\nSkkSn = Sn ∩Rk+1 = Sk .\n\n15. CW-COMPLEXES II\nNow there are two k-cells for each k with 0 ≤k ≤n, given by the two hemispheres of Sk. For\neach k there are two characteristic maps,\nu, l: Dk →Sk\ndefining the upper and lower hemispheres:\nu(x) = (x,\np\n1 -|x|2) ,\nl(x) = (x, -\np\n1 -|x|2) .\nNote that if |x| = 1 then |u(x)| = |l(x)| = 1, so each characteristic map restricts on the boundary\nto a map to Sk-1, and serves as an attaching map. This cell structure has the advantage that Sn-1\nis a subcomplex of Sn.\nThe case n = infis allowed here. Then Rinfdenotes the countably infinite dimensional inner\nproduct space that is the topological union of the leading subspaces Rn. The CW-complex Sinfis\nof finite type but not finite dimensional. It has the following interesting property. We know that\nSn is not contractible (because the identity map and a constant map have different behavior in\nhomology), but:\nProposition 15.5. Sinfis contractible.\nProof. This is an example of a \"swindle,\" making use of infinite dimensionality. Let T : Rinf→Rinf\nsend (x1, x2, . . .) to (0, x1, x2, . . .). This sends Sinfto itself. The location of the leading nonzero\nentry is different for x and Tx, so the line segment joining x to Tx doesn't pass through the origin.\nTherefore\nx 7→tx + (1 -t)Tx\n|tx + (1 -t)Tx|\nprovides a homotopy 1 ≃T. On the other hand, T is homotopic to the constant map with value\n(1, 0, 0, . . .), again by an affine homotopy.\nThis \"inefficient\" CW structure on Sn has a second advantage: it's equivariant with respect to\nthe antipodal involution. This provides us with a CW structure on the orbit space for this action.\nRecall that RPk = Sk/ ∼where x ∼-x. The quotient map π : Sk →RPk is a double cover,\nidentifying upper and lower hemispheres. The inclusion of one sphere in the next is compatible with\nthis equivalence relation, and gives us \"linear\" embeddings RPk-1 ⊆RPk. This suggests that\n∅⊆RP0 ⊆RP1 ⊆· · · ⊆RPn\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nmight serve as a CW filtration. Indeed, for each k,\nSk-1\n/\nπ\nDk\nu\nRPk-1\n/ RPk\nis a pushout: A line in Rk+1 either lies in Rk or is determined by a unique point in the upper\nhemisphere of Sk.\nHomology of CW-complexes\nThe skeleton filtration of a CW complex leads to a long exact sequence in homology, showing that\nthe relative homology H∗(Xk, Xk-1) controls how the homology changes when you pass from Xk-1\nto Xk. What is this relative homology? If we pick a set of attaching maps, we get the following\ndiagram.\n`\nα Sk-1\n/\nf\n\n`\nα Dk\nα\n/\n\nW\nα Sk\nα\n\nXk-1\n/ Xk ∪f B\n/ Xk/Xk-1\nwhere W is the wedge sum (disjoint union with all basepoints identified): W\nα Sk\nα is a bouquet of\nspheres. The dotted map exists and is easily seen to be a homeomorphism.\nLuckily, the inclusion Xk-1 ⊆Xk satisfies what's needed to conclude that\nHq(Xk, Xk-1) →Hq(Xk/Xk-1, ∗)\nis an isomorphism. After all, Xk-1 is a deformation retract of the space you get from Xk by deleting\nthe center of each k-cell.\nWe know Hq(Xk/Xk-1, ∗) very well:\nHq(\n_\nα∈Ak\nSk\nα, ∗) ∼=\n(\nZ[Ak]\nq = k\nq = k .\nLesson: The relative homology Hk(Xk, Xk-1) keeps track of the k-cells of X.\nDefinition 16.1. The group of cellular n-chains in a CW complex X is\nCk(X) := Hk(Xk, Xk-1) = Z[Ak] .\nIf we put the fact that Hq(Xk, Xk-1) = 0 for q = k, k +1 into the homology long exact sequence\nof the pair, we find first that\nHq(Xk-1)\n∼\n=\n-→Hq(Xk)\nfor\nq = k, k -1 ,\nand then that there is a short exact sequence\n0 →Hk(Xk) →Ck(X) →Hk-1(Xk-1) →0 .\nSo if we fix a dimension q, and watch how Hq varies as we move through the skelata of X, we\nfind the following picture. Say q > 0. Since X0 is discrete, Hq(X0) = 0. Then Hq(Xk) continues to\n\n16. HOMOLOGY OF CW-COMPLEXES\nbe 0 till you get up to Xq. Hq(Xq) is a subgroup of the free abelian group Cq(X) and hence is free\nabelian. Relations may get introduced into it when we pass to Xq+1; but thereafter all the maps\nHq(Xq+1) →Hq(Xq+2) →· · ·\nare isomorphisms. All the q-dimensional homology of X is created on Xq, and all the relations in\nHq(X) occur by Xq+1.\nThis stable value of Hq(Xk) maps isomorphically to Hq(X), even if X is infinite dimensional.\nThis is because the union of the images of any finite set of singular simplices in X is compact and so\nlies in a finite subcomplex and in particular lies in a finite skeleton. So any chain in X is the image\nof a chain in some skeleton. Since Hq(Xk)\n∼\n=\n-→Hq(Xk+1) for k > q, we find that Hq(Xq) →Hq(X)\nis surjective. Similarly, if c ∈Sq(Xk) is a boundary in X, then it's a boundary in Xlfor some l≥k.\nThis shows that the map Hq(Xq+1) →Hq(X) is injective. We summarize:\nProposition 16.2. Let k, q ≥0. Then\nHq(Xk) = 0\nfor k < q\nand\nHq(Xk)\n∼\n=\n-→Hq(X)\nfor k > q .\nIn particular, Hq(X) = 0 if q exceeds the dimension of X.\nWe have defined the cellular n-chains of a CW complex X,\nCn(X) = Hn(Xn, Xn-1) ,\nand found that it is the free abelian group on the set of n cells. We claim that these abelian groups\nare related to each other; they form the groups in a chain complex.\nWhat should the boundary of an n-cell be? It's represented by a characteristic map Dn →Xn\nwhose boundary is the attaching map α : Sn-1 →Xn-1. This is a lot of information, and hard to\ninterpret because Xn-1 is itself potentially a complicated space. But things get much simpler if I\npinch out Xn-2. This suggests defining\nd : Cn(X) = Hn(Xn, Xn-1) ∂-→Hn-1(Xn) →Hn-1(Xn-1, Xn-2) = Cn-1(X) .\nThe fact that d2 = 0 is embedded in the following large diagram, in which the two columns and\nthe central row are exact.\nCn+1(X) = Hn+1(Xn+1, Xn)\n∂n\n\nd\n+\n0 = Hn-1(Xn-2)\n\nHn(Xn) /\njn\n/\n\nCn(X) = Hn(Xn, Xn-1)\n∂n-1\n/\nd\n+\nHn-1(Xn-1)\njn-1\n\nHn(Xn+1)\n\nCn-1(X) = Hn-1(Xn-1, Xn-2)\n0 = Hn(Xn+1, Xn)\nNow, ∂n-1 *jn = 0. So the composite of the diagonals is zero, i.e., d2 = 0, and we have a chain\ncomplex! This is the \"cellular chain complex\" of X.\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nWe should compute the homology of this chain complex, Hn(C∗(X)) = ker d/ im d. Now\nker d = ker(jn-1 *∂n-1) .\nBut jn-1 is injective, so\nker d = ker ∂n-1 = im jn = Hn(Xn) .\nOn the other hand\nim d = jn(im ∂n) = im ∂n ⊆Hn(Xn) .\nSo\nHn(C∗(X)) = Hn(Xn)/ im ∂n = Hn(Xn+1)\nby exactness of the left column; but as we know this is exactly Hn(X)! We have proven the following\nresult.\nTheorem 16.3. For a CW complex X, there is an isomorpphism\nH∗(C∗(X)) ∼= H∗(X)\nnatural with respect to filtration-preserving maps between CW complexes.\nThis has an immediate and surprisingly useful corollary.\nCorollary 16.4. Suppose that the CW complex X has only even cells - that is, X2k ,→X2k+1 is\nan isomorphism for all k. Then\nH∗(X) ∼= C∗(X) .\nThat is, Hn(X) = 0 for n odd, is free abelian for all n, and the rank of Hn(X) for n even is the\nnumber of n-cells.\nExample 16.5. Complex projective space CPn has a CW structure in which\nSk2kCPn = Sk2k+1CPn = CPk .\nThe attaching S2k-1 →CPk sends v ∈S2k-1 ⊆Cn to the complex line through v. So\nHk(CPn) =\n(\nZ\nfor 0 ≤k ≤2n, k even\notherwise .\nFinally, notice that in our proof of Theorem 16.3 we used only properties contained in the\nEilenberg-Steenrod axioms.\nAs a result, any construction of a homology theory satisfying the\nEilenberg-Steenrod axioms gives you the same values on CW complexes as singular homology.\nReal projective space\nLet's try to compute H∗(RPn). This computation will invoke a second way to think of the cellular\nchain group Cn(X). Each cell has a characteristic map Dn →Xn, and we have the diagram\n`(Dn, Sn-1)\n/\n'\n(Xn, Xn-1)\n\n(W Sn, ∗).\n\n17. REAL PROJECTIVE SPACE\nWe've shown that the vertical map induces an isomorphism in homology, and the diagonal does as\nwell. (For example, ` Dn has a CW structure in which the (n -1)-skeleton is ` Sn-1.) So\nHn(`(Dn, Sn-1))\n∼\n=\n-→Cn(X).\nWe have a CW structure on RPn with Skk(RPn) = RPk; there is one k-cell - which we'll\ndenote by ek - for each k between 0 and n. So the cellular chain complex looks like this:\nC0(RPn)\no\nC1(RPn)\no\n· · ·\no\nCn(RPn)\no\no\nZ⟨e0⟩\no\nZ⟨e1⟩\nd=0\no\n· · ·\no\nZ⟨en⟩\no\no\nThe first differential is zero because we know what H0(RPn) is (it's Z!). The differential in the\ncellular chain complex is given by the top row in the following commutative diagram.\nCn = Hn(RPn, RPn-1)∂\n/ Hn-1(RPn-1)\n/\n*\nHn-1(RPn-1, RPn-2) = Cn-1\n∼\n=\n\nHn(Dn, Sn-1)\n∼\n=\nO\n∂\n∼\n=\n/ Hn-1(Sn-1)\nπ∗\nO\n/ Hn-1(Dn-1/Sn-2, ∗) .\nThe map π : Sn-1 →RPn-1 is the attaching map of the top cell of RP n; that is, the double\ncover.\nThe diagonal composite pinches the subspace RPn-2 to a point.\nThe composite map\nSn-1 →Dn-1/Sn-2 factors as follows:\nSn-1\ndouble cover\n/\n)\nRPn-1\npinch\n/ Dn-1/Sn-2 ∼= Sn-1\nSn-1/Sn-2 = Sn-1 ∨Sn-1\nOne of the maps Sn-1 →Sn-1 from the wedge is the identity, and the other map is the antipodal\nmap α : Sn-1 →Sn-1. Write σ for a generator of Hn-1(Sn-1). Then in Hn-1 we have σ 7→\n(σ, σ) 7→σ + α∗σ. So we need to know the degree of the antipodal map on Sn-1. The antipodal\nmap reverses all n coordinates in Rn. Each reversal is a reflection, and acts on Sn-1 by a map of\ndegree -1. So\ndeg α = (-1)n .\nTherefore the cellular complex of RPn is as follows:\ndim\n-1\n· · ·\nn\nn + 1\n· · ·\nZ\no\nZ\no\n· · ·\no\nZ\n2 or 0\no\no\n· · ·\no\nThe homology is then easy to read off.\nProposition 17.1. The homology of real projective space is as follows.\nHk(RPn) =\n\nZ\nk = 0\nZ\nk = n odd\nZ/2Z\nk odd, 0 < k < n\notherwise .\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nHere's a table.

A CW structure involves attaching maps\n`Sn-1 →Skn-1X .\nKnowing these, up to homotopy, determines the full homotopy type of the CW complex. Homology\ndoes not record all this information.\nInstead, it records only information about the composite\nobtained by pinching out Skn-2X.\n`\na∈An Sn-1\na\n/\n(\nSkn-1X\n\nW\nb∈An-1 Sn-1\nb\n.\nIn Hn-1, this can be identified with a map\n∂: Z[An] →Z[An-1]\nthat is none other than the differential in the cellular chain complex.\nThe moral: homology picks offonly the \"first order\" structure of a CW complex.\nOn the other hand, we'll see in the next lecture that it does a very good job of that.\nEuler characteristic and homology approximation\nTheorem 18.1. Let X be a finite CW-complex with an n-cells. Then\nχ(X) =\ninf\nX\nk=0\n(-1)kak\ndepends only on the homotopy type of X; it is independent of the choice of CW structure.\n\n18. EULER CHARACTERISTIC AND HOMOLOGY APPROXIMATION\nThis integer χ(X) is called the Euler characteristic of X. We will prove this theorem by show-\ning that χ(X) equals a number computed from the homology groups of X, which are themselves\nhomotopy invariants.\nWe'll need a little bit of information about the structure of finitely generated abelian groups.\nLet A be an abelian group. The set of torsion elements of A,\nTors(A) = {a ∈A : na = 0 for some n = 0} ,\nis a subgroup of A. A group is torsion free if Tors(A) = 0. For any A the quotient group A/Tors(A)\nis torsion free.\nFor a general abelian group, that's about all you can say. But now assume A is finitely generated.\nThen Tors(A) is a finite abelian group and A/Tors(A) is a finitely generated free abelian group,\nisomorphic to Zr for some integer r called the rank of A. Pick elements of A that map to a set\nof generators of A/Tors(A), and use them to define a map A/TorsA →A splitting the projection\nmap. This shows that if A is finitely generated then\nA ∼= Tors(A) ⊕Zr .\nA finite abelian group A is necessarily of the form\nZ/n1 ⊕Z/n2 ⊕· · · ⊕Z/nt where n1|n2| · · · |nt .\nThe ni are the \"torsion coefficients\" of A. They are well defined natural numbers.\nLemma 18.2. Let 0 →A →B →C →0 be a short exact sequence of finitely generated abelian\ngroups. Then\nrank A -rank B + rank C = 0 .\nTheorem 18.3. Let X be a finite CW complex. Then\nχ(X) =\nX\nk\n(-1)krank Hk(X) .\nProof. Pick a CW-structure with, say, ak k-cells for each k. We have the cellular chain complex\nC∗. Write H∗, Z∗, and B∗for the homology, the cycles, and the boundaries, in this chain complex.\nFrom the definitions, we have two families of short exact sequences:\n0 →Zk →Ck →Bk-1 →0\nand\n0 →Bk →Zk →Hk →0 .\nLet's use them and facts about rank rewrite the alternating sum:\nX\nk\n(-1)kak =\nX\nk\n(-1)krank(Ck)\n=\nX\nk\n(-1)k(rank (Zk) + rank (Bk-1))\n=\nX\nk\n(-1)k(rank (Bk) + rank (Hk) + rank (Bk-1))\nThe terms rank Bk + rank Bk-1 cancel because it's an alternating sum. This leaves P\nk(-1)krank Hk.\nBut Hk ∼= Hsing\nk\n(X).\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nIn the early part of the 20th century, \"homology groups\" were not discussed. It was Emmy\nNoether who first described things that way. Instead, people worked mainly with the sequence of\nranks,\nβk = rank Hk(X) ,\nwhich are known (following Poincare) as the Betti numbers of X.\nGiven a CW-complex X of finite type, can we give a lower bound on the number of k-cells in terms\nof the homology of X? Let's see. Hk(X) is finitely generated because Ck(X) ←- Zk(X) ↠Hk(X).\nThus\nHk(X) =\nt(k)\nM\ni=1\nZ/ni(k)Z ⊕Zr(k)\nwhere the n1(k)| · · · |nt(k)(k) are the torsion coefficients of Hk(X) and r(k) is the rank.\nThe minimal chain complex with Hk = Zr and Hq = 0 for q = k is just the chain complex with 0\neverywhere except for Zr in the kth degree. The minimal chain complex of free abelian groups with\nHk = Z/nZ and Hq = 0 for q = k is the chain complex with 0 everywhere except in dimensions\nk + 1 and k, where we have Z n-→Z These small complexes are called elementary chain complexes.\nThis implies that a lower bound on the number of k-cells is\nr(k) + t(k) + t(k -1) .\nThe first two terms give generators for Hk, and the last gives relations for Hk-1.\nThese elementary chain complexes can be realized as the reduced cellular chains of CW complexes\n(at least if k > 0). A wedge of r copies of Sk has a CW structure with one 0-cell and r k-cells, so\nits cellular chain complex has Zr in dimension k and 0 in other positive dimensions. To construct a\nCW complex with cellular chain complex given by Z n-→Z in dimensions k + 1 and k and 0 in other\npositive dimensions, start with Sk as k-skeleton and attach a k + 1-cell by a map of degree n. For\nexample, when k = 1 and n = 2, you have RP2. These CW complexes are called \"Moore spaces.\"\nThis maximally efficient construction of a CW complex in a homotopy type can in fact be\nachieved, at least in the simply connected case:\nTheorem 18.4 (Wall, [10]). Let X be a simply connected CW-complex of finite type. Then there\nexists a CW complex Y with r(k) + t(k) + t(k -1) k-cells, for all k, and a homotopy equivalence\nY →X.\nWe will prove this theorem in 18.906.\nThe construction of Moore spaces can be generalized:\nProposition 18.5. For any graded abelian group A∗with Ak = 0 for k ≤0, there exists a CW\ncomplex X with eH∗(X) = A∗.\nProof. Let A be any abelian group. Pick generators for A. They determine a surjection from a free\nabelian group F0. The kernel F1 of that surjection is free, being a subgroup of a free abelian group.\nWrite G0 for minimal set of generators of F0, and G1 for a minimal set of generators for F1.\nLet k ≥1. Define Xk to be the wedge of |G0| copies of Sk, so Hk(Xk) = ZG0. Now define an\nattaching map\nα :\na\nb∈G1\nSk\nb →Xk\n\n19. COEFFICIENTS\nby specifying it on each summand Sk\nb . The generator b ∈G1 is given by a linear combination of the\ngenerators of F0, say\nb =\ns\nX\ni=1\nniai .\nWe want to mimic this in topology. To do this, first map Sk →Ws Sk by pinching (s -1) tangent\ncircles to points. In homology, this map takes a generator of Hk(Sk) to the sum of the generators\nof the k-dimensional homology of the various spheres in the bouquet. Map the ith sphere in the\nwedge to Sk\nai ⊆Xk by a map of degree ni. The map on the summand Sk\nb is then the composite of\nthese two maps,\nSk\nb →\ns_\ni=1\nSk →\n_\na\nSk\na .\nAltogether, we get a map α that realizes F1 →F0 in Hk. So using it as an attaching map produces\na CW complex X with eHq(X) = A for q = k and 0 otherwise. Write M(A, k) for a CW complex\nproduced in this way.\nFinally, given a graded abelian group A∗, form the wedge over k of the spaces M(Ak, k).\nSuch a space M(A, k), with eHq(M(A, k)) = A for q = k and 0 otherwise, is called a Moore space\nof type (A, k) [9]. The notation is a bit deceptive, since M(A, k) cannot be made into a functor\nAb →HoTop.\nCoefficients\nAbelian groups can be quite complicated, even finitely generated ones. Vector spaces over a field\nare so much simpler! A vector space is determined up to isomorphism by a single cardinality, its\ndimension. Wouldn't it be great to have a version of homology that took values in the category of\nvector spaces over a field?\nWe can do this, and more. Let R be any commutative ring at all. Instead of forming the free\nabelian group on Sin∗(X), we could just as well form the free R-module:\nS∗(X; R) = RSin∗(X)\nThis gives, first, a simplicial object in the category of R-modules. Forming the alternating sum of\nthe face maps produces a chain complex of R-modules: Sn(X; R) is an R-module for each n, and\nd : Sn(X; R) →Sn-1(X; R) is an R-module homomorphism. The homology groups are then again\nR-modules:\nHn(X; R) = ker(d : Sn(X; R) →Sn-1(X; R))\nim(d : Sn+1(X; R) →Sn(X; R)) .\nThis is the singular homology of X with coefficients in the commutative ring R. It satisfies all\nthe Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, with\nHn(∗; R) =\n(\nR\nfor\nn = 0\notherwise .\n(We could actually have replaced the ring R by any abelian group here, but this will become much\nclearer after we have the tensor product as a tool.) This means that all the work we have done\nfor \"integral homology\" carries over to homology with any coefficients.\nIn particular, if X is a\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nCW complex we have the cellular homology with coefficients in R, C∗(X; R), and its homology is\nisomorphic to H∗(X; R).\nThe coefficient rings that are most important in algebraic topology are simple ones: the integers\nand the prime fields Fp and Q; almost always a PID.\nAs an experiment, let's compute H∗(RPn; R) for various rings R. Let's start with R = F2, the\nfield with 2 elements. This is a favorite among algebraic topologists, because using it for coefficients\neliminates all sign issues. The cellular chain complex has Ck(RPn; F2) = F2 for 0 ≤k ≤n, and\nthe differential alternates between multiplication by 2 and by 0. But in F2, 2 = 0: so d = 0, and\nthe cellular chains coincide with the homology:\nHk(RPn; F2) =\n(\nF2\nfor\n0 ≤k ≤n\notherwise .\nOn the other hand, suppose that R is a ring in which 2 is invertible. The universal case is Z[1/2],\nbut any subring of the rationals containing 1/2 would do just as well, as would Fp for p odd. Now\nthe cellular chain complex (in dimensions 0 through n) looks like\nR\n0←-R\n∼\n=\n←-R\n0←-R\n∼\n=\n←-· · ·\n∼\n=\n←-R\nfor n even, and\nR\n0←-R\n∼\n=\n←-R\n0←-R\n∼\n=\n←-· · ·\n0←-R\nfor n odd. Therefore for n even\nHk(RPn; R) =\n(\nR\nfor\nk = 0\notherwise\nand for n odd\nHk(RPn; R) =\n\nR\nfor\nk = 0\nR\nfor\nk = n\notherwise .\nYou get a much simpler result: Away from 2, even projective spaces look like points, and odd\nprojective spaces look like spheres!\nI'd like to generalize this process a little bit, and allow coefficients not just in a commutative\nring, but more generally in a module M over a commutative ring; in particular, any abelian group.\nThis is most cleanly done using the mechanism of the tensor product. That mechanism will also let\nus address the following natural question:\nQuestion 19.1. Given H∗(X; R), can we deduce H∗(X; M) for an R-module M?\nThe answer is called the \"universal coefficient theorem\". I'll spend a few days developing what\nwe need to talk about this.\nTensor product\nThe category of R-modules is what might be called a \"categorical ring,\" in which addition corre-\nsponds to the direct sum, the zero element is the zero module, 1 is R itself, and multiplication is\n. . . well, the subject for today. We care about the tensor product for two reasons: First, it allows\nus to deal smoothly with bilinear maps such that the cross-product. Second, and perhaps more\n\n20. TENSOR PRODUCT\nimportant, it will allow us relate homology with coefficients in an any R-module to homology with\ncoefficients in the PID R; for example, relate H∗(X; M) to H∗(X), where M is any abelian group.\nLet's begin by recalling the definition of a bilinear map over a commutative ring R.\nDefinition 20.1. Given three R-modules, M, N, P, a bilinear map (or, to be explicit, R-bilinear\nmap) is a function β : M × N →P such that\nβ(x + x′, y) = β(x, y) + β(x′, y) ,\nβ(x, y + y′) = β(x, y) + β(x, y′) ,\nand\nβ(rx, y) = rβ(x, y) ,\nβ(x, ry) = rβ(x, y) ,\nfor x, x′ ∈M, y, y′ ∈N, and r ∈R.\nExample 20.2. Rn × Rn →R given by the dot product is an R-bilinear map. The cross product\nR3 × R3 →R3 is R-bilinear. If R is a ring, the multiplication R × R →R is R-bilinear, and the\nmultiplication on an R-module M given by R × M →M is R-bilinear. This enters into topology\nbecause the cross-product Hm(X; R) × Hn(Y ; R) ×\n-→Hm+n(X × Y ; R) is R-bilinear.\nWouldn't it be great to reduce stuffabout bilinear maps to linear maps? We're going to do this\nby means of a universal property.\nDefinition 20.3. Let M, N be R-modules. A tensor product of M and N is an R-module P and a\nbilinear map β0 : M × N →P such that for every R-bilinear map β : M × N →Q there is a unique\nfactorization\nM × N\nβ0\n/\nβ\n#\nP\nf\n\nQ\nthrough an R-module homomorphism f.\nWe should have pointed out that the composition f *β0 is indeed again R-bilinear; but this is\neasy to check.\nSo β0 is a universal bilinear map out of M×N. Instead of β0 we're going to write ⊗: M×N →P.\nThis means that β(x, y) = f(x ⊗y) in the above diagram. There are lots of things to say about\nthis. When you have something that is defined via a universal property, you know that it's unique\n. . . but you still have to check that it exists!\nConstruction 20.4. I want to construct a univeral R-bilinear map out of M ×N. Let β : M ×N →\nQ be any R-bilinear map. This β isn't linear. Maybe we should first extend it to a linear map.\nThere is a unique R-linear extension over the free R-module R⟨M ×N⟩generated by the set M ×N:\nM × N\nβ\n/\n[-]\n&\nQ\nR⟨M × N⟩\nβ\n:\nThe map [-], including a basis, isn't bilinear. So we should quotient R⟨M × N⟩by a submodule S\nof relations to make it bilinear. So S is the sub R-module generated by the four familes of elements\n(corresponding to the four relations in the definition of R-bilinearity):\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\n1. [(x + x′, y)] -[(x, y)] -[(x′ -y)]\n2. [(x, y + y′)] -[(x, y)] -[(x, y′)]\n3. [(rx, y)] -r[(x, y)]\n4. [(x, ry)] -r[(x, y)]\nfor x, x′ ∈M, y, y′ ∈N, and r ∈R. Now the composite M × N →R⟨M × N⟩/S is R-bilinear -\nwe've quotiented out by all things that prevented it from being so! And the map R⟨M × N⟩→Q\nfactors as R⟨M × N⟩→R⟨M × N⟩/S\nf-→Q, where f is R-linear, and uniquely because the map to\nthe quotient is surjective. This completes the construction.\nIf you find yourself using this construction, stop and think about what you're doing. You're\nnever going to use this construction to compute anything. Here's an example: for any abelian group\nA,\nA × Z/nZ →A/nA ,\n(a, b) 7→ba\nmod nA\nis clearly bilinear, and is universal as such.\nJust look: If β : A × Z/nZ →Q is bilinear then\nβ(na, b) = nβ(a, b) = β(a, nb) = β(a, 0) = 0, so β factors through A/nA; and A × Z/nZ →A/nA\nis surjective. So A ⊗Z/nZ = A/nA.\nRemark 20.5. The image of M ×N in R⟨M ×N⟩/S generates it as an R-module. These elements\nx ⊗y are called \"decomposable tensors.\"\nWhat are the properties of such a universal bilinear map?\nProperty 20.6 (Uniqueness). Suppose β0 : M × N →P and β′\n0 : M × N →P ′ are both universal.\nThen there's a linear map f : P →P ′ such that β′\n0 = fβ0 and a linear map f′ : P ′ →P such that\nβ0 = f′β′\n0. The composite f′f : P →P is a linear map such that f′fβ0 = f′β′\n0 = β0. The identity\nmap is another. But by universality, there's only one such linear map, so f′f = 1P . An identical\nargument shows that ff′ = 1P ′ as well, so they are inverse linear isomorphism. In brief:\nThe target of a univeral R-bilinear map β0 : M × N →P is unique up to a unique\nR-linear isomorphism compatible with the map β0.\nThis entitles us to speak of \"the\" universal bilinear map out of M ×N, and give the target a symbol:\nM ⊗R N. If R is the ring of integers, or otherwise understood, we will drop it from the notation.\nProperty 20.7 (Functoriality). Suppose f : M →M′ and : N →N′. Study the diagram\nM × N\nf×g\n\n⊗\n/\n&\nM ⊗N\nf⊗g\n\nM′ × N′\n⊗\n/ M′ ⊗N′\nThere is a unique R-linear map f ⊗g because the diagonal map is R-bilinear and the map M ×N →\nM ⊗N is the universal R-bilinear map out of M ×N. You are invited to show that this construction\nis functorial.\n\n20. TENSOR PRODUCT\nProperty 20.8 (Unitality, associativity, commutativity). I said that this was going to be a \"cate-\ngorical ring,\" so we should check various properties of the tensor product. For example, R ⊗R M\nshould be isomorphic to M.\nLet's think about this for a minute.\nWe have an R-bilinear map\nR × M →M, given by multiplication. We just need to check the universal property. Suppose we\nhave an R-bilinear map β : R × M →P. We have to construct a map f : M →P such that\nβ(r, x) = f(rx) and show it's unique. Our only choice is f(x) = β(1, x), and that works.\nSimilarly, we should check that there's a unique isomorphism L ⊗(M ⊗N)\n∼\n=\n-→(L ⊗M) ⊗N\nthat's compatible with L × (M × N) ∼= (L × M) × N, and that there's a unique isomorphism\nM ⊗N →N ⊗M that's compatible with the switch map M × N →N × M. There are a few other\nthings to check, too: Have fun!\nProperty 20.9 (Sums). What happens with M ⊗\nL\nα∈A Nα\n\n? This might be a finite direct sum,\nor maybe an uncountable collection. How does this relate to L\nα∈A(M ⊗Nα)? Let's construct a\nmap\nf :\nM\nα∈A\n(M ⊗Nα) →M ⊗\nM\nα∈A\nNα\n!\n.\nWe just need to define maps M ⊗Nα →M ⊗\nL\nα∈A Nα\n\nbecause the direct sum is the coproduct.\nWe can use 1 ⊗inα where inα : Nα →L\nα∈A Nα. These give you a map f.\nWhat about a map the other way? We'll define a map out of the tensor product using the\nuniversal property. So we need to define a bilinear map out of M ×\nL\nα∈A Nα\n\n. By linearity in\nthe second factor, it will suffice to say where to send elements of the form (x, y) ∈M ⊗Nβ. Just\nsend it to x ⊗inβy, where inβ : Nβ →L\nα∈A Nα is the inclusion of a summand. It's up to you to\ncheck that these are inverses.\nProperty 20.10 (Distributivity). Suppose f : M′ →M, r ∈R, and g0, g1 : N′ →N. Then\nf ⊗(g0 + g1) = f ⊗g0 + f ⊗g1 : M′ ⊗N′ →M ⊗N\nand\nf ⊗rg0 = r(f ⊗g0) : M′ ⊗N′ →M ⊗N .\nAgain I'll leave this to you to check.\nOur immediate use of this construction is to give a clean definition of \"homology with coefficients\nin M,\" where M is any abelian group. First, endow singular chains with coefficients in M like this:\nS∗(X; M) = S∗(X) ⊗M\nThen we define\nHn(X; M) = Hn(S∗(X; M)) .\nSince Sn(X) = ZSinn(X), Sn(X; M) is a direct sum of copies of M indexed by the n-simplices in X.\nIf M happens to be a ring, this coincides with the notation used in the last lecture. The boundary\nmaps are just d ⊗1 : Sn(X) ⊗M →Sn-1(X) ⊗M.\nAs we have noted, the sequence\n0 →Sn(A) →Sn(X) →Sn(X, A) →0\nis split short exact, and therefore applying the functor -⊗M to it produces another split short\nexact sequence. So\nSn(X, A) ⊗M = Sn(A; M)/Sn(X; M) ,\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nand it makes sense to use the notation Sn(X, A; M) for this. This is again a chain complex (by\nfunctoriality of the tensor product), and we define\nHn(X, A; M) = Hn(Sn(X, A; M)) .\nNotice that\nHn(∗; M) =\n(\nM\nfor n = 0\notherwise .\nThe following result is immediate:\nProposition 20.11. For any abelian group M, (X, A) 7→H∗(X, A; M) provides a homology theory\nsatisfying the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms with H0(∗; M) = M.\nSuppose R is a commutative ring and A is an abelian group. Then A ⊗R is naturally an R-\nmodule. So S∗(X; R) is a chain complex of R-modules - free R-modules. We can go a little further:\nsuppose that M is an R-module. Then A ⊗M is an R-module; and S∗(X; M) is a chain complex\nof R-modules. We can also write\nS∗(X; M) = S∗(X; R) ⊗R M .\nThis construction is natural in the R-module M; and, again using the fact that sums of exact\nsequences are exact, a short exact sequence of R-modules\n0 →M′ →M →M′′ →0\nleads to a short exact sequence of chain complexes\n0 →S∗(X; M′) →S∗(X; M) →S∗(X; M′′) →0\nand hence to a long exact sequence in homology, a \"coefficient long exact sequence\":\n· · ·\n/ Hn+1(X; M′′)\n∂\ns\nHn(X; M′)\n/ Hn(X; M)\n/ Hn(X; M′′)\n∂\ns\nHn-1(X; M′)\n/ · · · .\nA particularly important case is when R is a field; then S∗(X; R) is a chain complex of vector\nspaces over R, and H∗(X; R) is a graded vector space over R.\nQuestion 20.12. A reasonable question is this: Suppose we know H∗(X).\nCan we compute\nH∗(X; M) for an abelian group M?\nMore generally, suppose we know H∗(X; R) and M is an\nR-module. Can we compute H∗(X; M)?\n\n21. TENSOR AND TOR\nTensor and Tor\nWe continue to study properties of the tensor product. Recall that\nA ⊗Z/nZ = A/nA .\nConsider the exact sequence\n0 →Z 2-→Z →Z/2Z →0 .\nLet's tensor it with Z/2Z. We get\n0 →Z/2Z →Z/2Z →Z/2Z →0 .\nThis cannot be a short exact sequence! This is a major tragedy: tensoring doesn't preserve exact\nsequences; one says that the functor Z/nZ ⊗-is not \"exact.\" This is why we can't form homology\nwith coefficients in M by simply tensoring homology with M.\nTensoring does respect certain exact sequences:\nProposition 21.1. The functor N 7→M ⊗R N preserves cokernels; it is right exact.\nProof. Suppose that N′ →N →N′′ →0 is exact and let f : M ⊗N →Q. We wish to show that\nthere is a unique factorization as shown in the diagram\nM ⊗N′\n/\n&\nM ⊗N\nf\n\n/ M ⊗N′′\n/\nx\nQ .\nThis is equivalent to asking whether there is a unique factorization of the corresponding diagram of\nbilinear maps,\nM × N′\n/\n&\nM × N\nβ\n\n/ M × N′′\n/\nx\nQ\n- uniqueness of the linear factorization is guaranteed by the fact that M × N′′ generates M ⊗N′′.\nThis unique factorization reflects the fact that M × -preserves cokernels.\nFailure of exactness is bad, so let's try to repair it. A key observation is that if M is free, then\nM ⊗R -is exact. If M = RS, the free R-module on a set S, then M ⊗R N = ⊕SN, since tensoring\ndistributes over direct sums. Then we remember the following \"obvious\" fact:\nLemma 21.2. If M′\ni →Mi →M′′\ni is exact for all i ∈I, then so is\nM\nM′\ni →\nM\nMi →\nM\nM′′\ni .\nProof. Clearly the composite is zero. Let (xi ∈Mi, i ∈I) ∈L Mi and suppose it maps to zero.\nThat means that each xi maps to zero in M′′\ni and hence is in the image of some x′\ni ∈M′\ni. Just make\nsure to take x′\ni = 0 if xi = 0.\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nTo exploit this observation, we'll \"resolve\" M by free modules. This means: find a surjection\nfrom a free R-module, F0 →M. This amounts to specifying R-module generators. For a general ring\nR, the kernel of F0 →M may not be free. For the moment, let's make sure that it is by assuming\nthat R is a PID, and write F1 for the kernel. The failure of M ⊗-to be exact is measured, at least\npartially, by the leftmost term (defined as a kernel) in the exact sequence\n0 →TorR\n1 (M, N) →F1 ⊗R N →F0 ⊗R N →M ⊗R N →0 .\nThe notation suggests that this Tor term is independent of the resolution. This is indeed the\ncase, as we shall show presently. But before we do, let's compute some Tor groups.\nExample 21.3. For any PID R, if M = F is free over R we can take F0 = F and F1 = 0, and\ndiscover that then TorR\n1 (F, N) = 0 for any N.\nExample 21.4. Let R = Z and M = Z/nZ, and N any abelian group. When R = Z it is often\nomitted from the notation for Tor. There is a nice free resolution staring at us: F0 = F1 = Z, and\nF1 →F0 given by multiplication by n. The sequence defining Tor1 looks like\n0 →Tor1(Z/nZ, N) →Z ⊗N\nn⊗1\n--→Z ⊗N →Z/nZ ⊗N →0 ,\nso\nZ/nZ ⊗N = N/nN ,\nTor1(Z/nZ, N) = ker(n|N) .\nThe torsion in this case is the \"n-torsion\" in N. This accounts for the name.\nFunctors like Tor1 can be usefully defined for any ring, and moving to that general case makes\ntheir significance clearer and illuminates the reason why Tor1 is independent of choice of generators.\nSo let R be any ring and M a module over it. By picking R-module generators I can produce a\nsurjection from a free R-module, F0 →M. Write K0 for the kernel of this map. It is the module\nof relations among the generators. We can no longer guarantee that it's free, but we can at least\nfind a set of module generators for it, and construct a surjection from a free R-module, F1 →K0.\nContinuing in this way, we get a diagram like this -\n· · ·\n/\n!\nF2\n\nd\n/ F1\n\nd\n/ F0\n\nK2\n>\n!\nK1\n>\n!\nK0\n>\n!\nN\n\n=\n=\n=\n>\n- in which the upside-down V subdiagrams are short exact sequences and Fs is free for all s. Splicing\nthese exact sequences gives you an exact sequence in the top row. This is a free resolution of N.\nThe top row, F∗, is a chain complex. It maps to the very short chain complex with N in degree\n0 and 0 elsewhere, and this chain map is a homology isomorphism (or \"quasi-isomorphism\"). We\nhave in effect replaced N with this chain complex of free modules. The module N may be very\ncomplicated, with generators, relations, relations between relations . . . . All this is laid out in front\nof us by the free resolution. Generators of F0 map to generators for N, and generators for F1 map\nto relations among those generators.\n\n22. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF HOMOLOGICAL ALGEBRA\nNow we can try to define higher Tor functors by tensoring F∗with N and taking homology. If\nR is a PID and the resolution is just F1 →F0, forming homology is precisely taking cokernel and\nkernel, as we did above. In general, we define\nTorR\nn (M, N) = Hn(M ⊗R F∗) .\nIn the next lecture we will check that this is well-defined - independent of free resolution, and\nfunctorial in the arguments. For the moment, notice that\nTorR\nn (M, F) = 0\nfor n > 0\nif F is free ,\nsince I can take F\n∼\n=\n←-F ←0 ←· · · as a free resolution; and that\nTorR\n0 (M, N) = M ⊗R N\nsince we know that M ⊗R -is right-exact.\nThe fundamental theorem of homological algebra\nWe will now show that the R-modules TorR\nn (M, N) are well-defined and functorial. This will be an\napplication of a very general principle.\nTheorem 22.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Homological Algebra). Let M and N be R-modules; let\n0 ←M ←E0 ←E1 ←· · ·\nbe a sequence in which each En is free; let\n0 ←N ←F0 ←F1 ←· · ·\nbe an exact sequence; and let f : M →N be a homomorphism. Then we can lift f to a chain map\nf∗: E∗→F∗, uniquely up to chain homotopy.\nProof. Let's try to construct f0. Consider:\n/ K0 = ker(εM)\n/\ng0\n\nE0\nεM /\nf0\n\nM\nf\n\n/ L0 = ker(εN)\n/ F0\nεN\n/ N\n/ 0\nWe know that E0 = RS for some set S. What we do is map the generators of E0 into M via εM\nand then into F via f, and then lift them to F0 via εN (which is possible because it's surjective).\nThen extend to a homomorphism, to get f0. You can restrict f0 to kernels to get g0.\nNow the map d : E1 →E0 satisifes εM *d = 0, and so factors through a map to K0 = ker εM.\nSimilarly, d : F1 →F0 factors through a map F1 →L0, and this map must be surjective because\nthe sequence F1 →F0 →N is exact. We find ourselves in exactly the same situation:\n/ K1\n/\ng1\n\nE1\n/\nf1\n\nK0\ng0\n\n/ L1\n/ F1\n/ L0\n/ 0\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nSo we construct f∗by induction.\nNow we need to prove the chain homotopy claim. So suppose I have f∗, f′\n∗: E∗→F∗, both lifting\nf : M →N. Then f′\nn -fn (which we'll rename ln) is a chain map lifting 0 : M →N. We want to\nconsruct a chain null-homotopy of l∗; that is, we want h : En →Fn+1 such that dh + hd = ln. At\nthe bottom, E-1 = 0, so we want h : E0 →F1 such that dh = l0. This factorization happens in\ntwo steps.\nE0\nl0\n\n~\nh\nv\n/ M\n\nF1\n/ / L0\n/ F0\nεN / N .\nFirst, εNl0 = 0 implies that l0 factors through L0 = ker εN. Next, F1 →L0 is surjective, by\nexactness, and E0 is free, so we can lift generators and extend R-linearly to get h : E0 →F1..\nThe next step is organized by the diagram\nE1\nd\n/\nl1\n\n~\nh\nv\nE0\nl0\n\nh\n~\nF2\n/ /\nd\nL1\n/ F1\nd\n/ F0\nThis diagram doesn't commute; dh = l0, but the (d, h, l1) triangle doesn't commute. Rather, we\nwant to construct h : E1 →F2 such that dh = l1 -hd. Since\nd(l1 -hd) = l0d -dhd = (l0 -dh)d = 0 .\nthe map l1 -hd lifts to L1 = ker d. But then it lifts through F2, since F2 →L1 is surjective and\nE1 is free.\nExactly the same process continues.\nThis proof uses a property of freeness that is shared by a broader class of modules.\nDefinition 22.2. An R-module P is projective if any map out of P factors through any surjection:\nM\n\nP\n>\n/ N\nEvery free module is projective, and this is the property of freeness that we jave been using; the\nFundamental Theorem of Homological Algebra holds under the weaker assumption that each En is\nprojective.\nAny direct summand in a projective is also projective. Any projective module is a direct sum-\nmand of a free module. Over a PID, every projective is free, because any submodule of a free is\nfree. But there are examples of nonfree projectives:\nExample 22.3. Let k be a field and let R be the product ring k × k. It acts on k in two ways, via\n(a, b)c = ac and via (a, b)c = bc. These are both projective R-modules that are not free.\nNow we will apply Theorem 22.1 to verify that our proposed construction of Tor is independent\nof free (or projective!) resolution, and is functorial.\n\n22. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF HOMOLOGICAL ALGEBRA\nSuppose I have f : N′ →N.\nPick arbitrary free resolutions N′ ←F ′\n∗and N ←F∗, and\npick any chain map f∗: F ′\n∗→F∗lifting f.\nWe claim that the map induced in homology by\n1 ⊗f∗: M ⊗R F ′\n∗→M ⊗R F∗is independent of the choice of lift. Suppose f′\n∗is another lift, and\npick a chain homotopy h : f∗≃f′\n∗. Since M ⊗R -is additive, the relation\n1 ⊗h : 1 ⊗f∗≃1 ⊗f′\n∗\nstill holds. So 1 ⊗f∗and 1 ⊗f′\n∗induce the same map in homology.\nFor example, suppose that F∗and F ′\n∗are two projective resolutions of N. Any two lifts of the\nidentity map are chain-homotopic, and so induce the same map H∗(M ⊗R F∗) →H∗(M ⊗R F ′\n∗).\nSo if f : F∗→F ′\n∗and g : F ′\n∗→F∗are chain maps lifing the identity, then f∗*g∗induces the same\nself-map of H∗(M ⊗R F ′\n∗) as the identity self-map does, and so (by functoriality) is the identity.\nSimilarly, g∗*f∗induces the identity map on H∗(M ⊗R F∗). So they induce inverse isomorphisms.\nPutting all this together shows that any two projective resolutions of N induce canonically\nisomorphic modules TorR\nn (M, N), and that a homomorphism f : N′ →N induces a well defined\nmap TorR\nn (M, N′) →TorR\nn (M, N) that renders TorR\nn (M, -) a functor.\nMy last comment about Tor is that there's a symmetry there. Of course, M ⊗R N ∼= N ⊗R M.\nThis uses the fact that R is commutative.\nThis leads right on to saying that TorR\nn (M, N) ∼=\nTorR\nn (N, M). We've been computing Tor by taking a resolution of the second variable. But I could\nequally have taken a resolution of the first variable. This follows from Theorem 22.1.\nExample 22.4. I want to give an example when you do have higher Tor modules. Let k be a field,\nand let R = k[d]/(d2). This is sometimes called the \"dual numbers,\" or the exterior algebra over k.\nWhat is an R-module? It's just a k-vector space M with an operator d (given by multiplication by\nd) that satisfies d2 = 0. Even though there's no grading around, I can still define the \"homology\"\nof M:\nH(M; d) = ker d\nim d .\nThis k-algebra is augmented by an algebra map ε : R →k splitting the unit; ε(d) = 0. This\nrenders k an R-module. Let's construct a free R-module resolution of this module. Here's a picture.\n- o\n-\n-\no\n-\n-\no\n-\n-\no\n-\n-\no\nThe vertical lines indicate multiplication by d. We could write this as\n0 ←k\nε←-R\nd←-R\nd←-R ←· · · .\nNow tensor this over R with an R-module M; so M is a vector space equipped with an operator\nd with d2 = 0. Each copy of R gets replaced by a copy of M, and the differential gives multiplication\nby d on M. So taking homology gives\nTorR\nn (k, M) =\n(\nk ⊗R M = M/dM\nfor n = 0\nH(M; d)\nfor n > 0 .\nSo for example\nTorR\nn (k, k) = k\nfor n ≥0 .\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nHom and Lim\nWe will now develop more properties of the tensor product: its relationship to homomorphisms and\nto direct limits.\nThe tensor product arose in our study of bilinear maps. Even more natural are linear maps.\nGiven a commutative ring R and two R-modules M and N, we can think about the collection of\nall R-linear maps from M to N. Not only does this set form an abelian group (under pointwise\naddition of homomorphisms); it forms an R-module, with\n(rf)(y) = f(ry) = rf(y) ,\nr ∈R, y ∈M .\nThe check that this is again an R-module homomorphism uses commutativity of R. We will write\nHomR(M, N), or just Hom(M, N), for this R-module.\nSince Hom(M, N) is an R-module, we are entitled to think about what an R-module homomor-\nphism into it is. Given\nf : L →Hom(M, N)\nwe can define a new function\nˆf : L × M →N ,\nˆf(x, y) = (f(x))(y) ∈N .\nYou should check that this new function ˆf is R-bilinear! So we get a natural map\nHom(L, Hom(M, N)) →Hom(L ⊗M, N) .\nConversely, given a map ˆf : L ⊗M →N and x ∈L, we can define f(x) : M →N by the same\nformula. These are inverse operations, so:\nLemma 23.1. The natural map Hom(L, Hom(M, N)) →Hom(L ⊗M, N) is an isomorphism.\nOne says that ⊗and Hom are adjoint, a word suggested by Sammy Eilenberg to Dan Kan, who\nfirst formulated this relationship between functors [7].\nThe second thing we will discuss is a generalization of one perspective on how the rational\nnumbers are constructed from the integers - by a limit process: there are compatible maps in the\ndiagram\nZ\n/\n\nZ\n/\n1/2\n\nZ\n/\n1/3!\n\nZ\n/\n1/4!\n\n· · ·\nQ\n=\n/ Q\n=\n/ Q\n=\n/ Q\n= / · · ·\nand Q is the \"universal,\" or \"initial,\" abelian group you can map to.\nWe will formalize this process, using partially ordered sets as indexing sets. Recall from Lecture\n3 that a partially ordered set, or poset, is a small category I such that #I(i, j) ≤1 and the only\nisomorphisms are the identity maps. We will be interested in a particular class of posets.\nDefinition 23.2. A poset (I, ≤) is directed if for every i, j ∈I there exists k ∈I such that i ≤k\nand j ≤k.\nExample 23.3. This is a very common condition. A first example is the natural numbers N with\n≤as the order. Another example is the positive natural numbers, with i ≤j if i|j. This is because\ni, j|(ij). A topological example: if X is a space, A a subspace, and I is the set of open subsets of\nX containing A, directed by saying that U ≤V if U ⊇V . This is because an intersection of two\nopens is again open.\n\n23. HOM AND LIM\nDefinition 23.4. Let I be a directed set. An I-directed system in a category C is a functor I →C.\nThis means that for every i ∈I we are given an object Xi ∈C, and for every i ≤j we are given a\nmap fi,j : Xi →Xj, in such a way that fi,i = 1Xi and if i ≤j ≤k then fi,k = fj,k *fi,j : Xi →Xk.\nExample 23.5. If I = (N, ≤), then you get a \"linear system\" X0\nf01\n--→X1\nf12\n--→X2 →· · · .\nExample 23.6. Suppose I = (N>0, |), i.e., the second example above. You can consider I →Ab,\nsay assigning to each i the integers Z, and fij : Z\nj/i\n--→Z.\nThese directed systems can be a little complicated. But there's a simple one, namely the constant\none.\nExample 23.7. Let I be any directed system. Any object A ∈C determines an I-directed set,\nnamely the constant functor cA : I →C.\nNot every directed system is constant, but we can try to find a best approximating constant\nsystem. To compare systems, we need morphisms. I-directed systems in C are functors I →C.\nThey are related by natural transformations, and those are the morphisms in the category of I-\ndirected systems. That is to say, a morphism is a choice of map gi : Xi →Yi, for each i ∈I, such\nthat\nXi\n/\ngi\n\nXj\ngj\n\nYi\n/ Yj\ncommutes for all i ≤j.\nDefinition 23.8. Let X : I →C be a directed system. A direct limit is an object L and a map\nX →cL that is initial among maps to constant systems. This means that given any other map to\na constant system, say X →cA, there is a unique map f : L →A such that\ncL\ncf\n\nX\n' cA\ncommutes.\nThis is a \"universal property.\" So two different direct limits are canonically isomorphic; but a\ndirected system may fail to have a direct limit. For example, the linear directed systems we used\nto create the rational numbers exists in the category of finitely generated abelian groups; but Q is\nnot finitely generated, and there's no finitely generated group that will serve as a direct limit of this\nsystem in the category of finitely generated abelian groups.\nExample 23.9. Suppose we have an increasing sequence of subspaces, X0 ⊆X1 ⊆· · · ⊆X. This\ngives us a directed system of spaces, directed by the poset (N, ≤). It's pretty clear that as a set the\ndirect limit of this system is the union of the subspaces. Saying that X is the direct limit of this\ndirected system of spaces is saying first that X is the union of the Xi's, and second that the topology\non X is determined by the topology on the subspaces; it's the \"weak topology,\" characterized by\nthe property that a map f : X →Y is continuous if and only if the restriction of f to each Xn is\ncontinuous. This is saying that a subset of X is open if and only if its intersection with each Xn is\nopen in X. Our example is that a CW-complex is the direct limit of its skelata.\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nDirect limits may be constructed from the material of coproducts and quotients. So suppose\nX : I →C is a directed system. To construct the direct limit, begin by forming the coproduct over\nthe elements of I,\na\ni∈I\nXi .\nThere are maps ini : Xi →` Xi, but they are not yet compatible with the order relation in I.\nForm a quotient of the coproduct to enforce that compatibility:\nlim\n-→\ni∈I\nXi =\na\ni∈I\nXi\n!\n/ ∼\nwhere ∼is the equivalence relation generated by requiring that for any i ∈I and any x ∈Xi,\ninix ∼injfij(x) .\nThe process of forming the coproduct and the quotient will depend upon the category you are\nworking in, and may not be possible. In sets, coproduct is disjoint union and the quotient just\nforms equivalence classes.\nIn abelian groups, the coproduct is the direct sum and to form the\nquotient you divide by the subgroup generated by differences.\nDirect limits and the tensor product are nicely related, and the way to see that is to use the\nadjunction with Hom that we started with today.\nProposition 23.10. Let I be a direct set, and let M : I →ModR be a I-directed system of\nR-modules. There is a natural isomorphism\n(lim\n-→\nI\nMi) ⊗R N ∼= lim\n-→\nI\n(Mi ⊗R N) .\nProof. Let's verify that both sides satisfy the same universal property. A map from (lim\n-→I Mi)⊗R N\nto an R-module L is the same thing as a linear map lim\n-→I Mi →HomR(N, L). This is the same as\na compatible family of maps Mi →HomR(N, L), which in turn is the same as a compatible family\nof maps Mi ⊗R N →L, which is the same as a linear map lim\n-→I(Mi ⊗R N) →L.\nHere's a lemma that lets us identify when a map to a constant functor is a direct limit.\nLemma 23.11. Let X : I →Ab (or ModR). A map f : X →cL (given by fi : Xi →L for i ∈I)\nis the direct limit if and only if:\n1. For every x ∈L, there exists an i and an xi ∈Xi such that fi(xi) = x.\n2. Let xi ∈Xi be such that fi(xi) = 0 in L. Then there exists some j ≥i such that fij(xi) = 0\nin Xj.\nProof. Straightforward.\nProposition 23.12. The direct limit functor lim\n-→I : Fun(I, Ab) →Ab is exact. In other words, if\nX\np-→Y\nq-→Z is an exact sequence of I-directed systems (meaning that at every degree we get an\nexact sequence of abelian groups), then lim\n-→I X →lim\n-→I Y →lim\n-→I Z is exact.\n\n24. UNIVERSAL COEFFICIENT THEOREM\nProof. First of all, qp : X →Z is zero, which is to say that it factors through the constant zero\nobject, so lim\n-→I X →lim\n-→I Z is certainly the zero map. Let y ∈lim\n-→I Y , and suppose y maps to 0 in\nlim\n-→I Z. By condition (1) of Lemma 23.11, there exists i such that y = fi(yi) for some yi ∈Yi. Then\n0 = q(y) = fiq(yi) because q is a map of direct systems. By condition (2), this means that there is\nj ≥i such that fijq(yi) = 0 in Zj. So qfijyi = 0, again because q is a map of direct systems. We\nhave an element in Yj that maps to zero under q, so there is some xj ∈Xj such that p(xj) = yj.\nThen fj(xj) ∈lim\n-→I X maps to y.\nThe exactness of the direct limit has many useful consequences. For example:\nCorollary 23.13. Let i 7→C(i) be a directed system of chain complexes. Then there is a natural\nisomorphism\nlim\n-→\ni∈I\nH∗(C(i)) →H∗(lim\n-→\ni∈I\nC(i)) .\nPutting together things we have just said:\nCorollary 23.14. H∗(X; Q) = H∗(X) ⊗Q.\nSo we can redefine the Betti numbers of a space X as\nβn = dimQ Hn(X; Q)\nand discuss the Euler characteristic entirely in terms of the rational vector spaces making up the\nrational homology of X.\nUniversal coefficient theorem\nSuppose that we are given H∗(X; Z). Can we compute H∗(X; Z/2Z)? This is non-obvious. Consider\nthe map RP2 →S2 that pinches RP1 to a point. Now H2(RP2; Z) = 0, so in H2 this map is zero.\nBut in Z/2Z-coefficients, in dimension 2, this map gives an isomorphism. This shows that there's\nno functorial determination of H∗(X; Z/2) in terms of H∗(X; Z); the effect of a map in integral\nhomology does not determine its effect in mod 2 homology. So how do we go between different\ncoefficients?\nLet R be a commutative ring and M an R-module, and suppose we have a chain complex C∗of\nR-modules. It could be the singular complex of a space, but it doesn't have to be. Let's compare\nHn(C∗) ⊗M with Hn(C∗⊗M). (Here and below we'll just write ⊗for ⊗R.) The latter thing gives\nhomology with coefficients in M. How can we compare these two? Let's investigate, and build up\nconditions on R and C∗as we go along.\nFirst, there's a natural map\nα : Hn(C∗) ⊗M →Hn(C∗⊗M) ,\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nsending [z] ⊗m to [z ⊗m]. We propose to find conditions under which it is injective. The map α\nfits into a commutative diagram with exact columns like this:\nHn(C∗) ⊗M\nα\n/\nO\nHn(C∗⊗M)\nO\nZn(C∗) ⊗M\n/\nO\nZn(C∗⊗M)\nO\nCn+1 ⊗M\n=\n/\nO\nCn+1 ⊗M .\nO\nNow, Zn(C∗⊗M) is a submodule of Cn ⊗M, but the map Zn(C) ⊗M →Cn ⊗M need not be\ninjective . . . unless we impose more restrictions. If we can guarantee that it is, then a diagram chase\nshows that α is a monomorphism.\nSo let's assume that R is a PID and that Cn is a free R-module for all n. Then the submodule\nBn-1(C∗) ⊆Cn-1 is again free, so the short exact sequence\n/ Zn(C∗)\n/ Cn\n/\nd\n$\nBn-1(C∗)\n/\n\nCn-1\nsplits. So Zn(C∗) →Cn is a split monomorphism, and hence Zn(C∗) ⊗M →Cn ⊗M is too.\nIn fact, a little thought shows that this argument produces a splitting of the map α.\nNow, α is not always an isomorphism. But it certainly is if M = R, and it's compatible with\ndirect sums, so it certainly is if M is free. The idea is now to resolve M by frees, and see where\nthat idea takes us.\nSo let\n0 →F1 →F0 →M →0\nbe a free resolution of M. Again, we're using the assumption that R is a PID, to guarantee that\nker(F0 →M) is free. Again using the assumption that each Cn is free, we get a short exact sequence\nof chain complexes\n0 →C∗⊗F1 →C∗⊗F0 →C∗⊗M →0 .\nIn homology, this gives a long exact sequence. Unsplicing it gives the left-hand column in the\n\n25. KUNNETH AND EILENBERG-ZILBER\nfollowing diagram.\n\ncoker(Hn(C∗⊗F1) →Hn(C∗⊗F0))\n\n∼\n=\n/ coker(Hn(C∗) ⊗F1 →Hn(C∗) ⊗F0))\n\nHn(C∗⊗M)\n∂\n\n=\n/ Hn(C∗⊗M)\n\nker(Hn-1(C∗⊗F1) →Hn-1(C∗⊗F0))\n∼\n=\n/\n\nker(Hn-1(C∗) ⊗F1 →Hn-1(C∗) ⊗F0)\n\nThe right hand column occurs because α is an isomorphism when the module involved is free. But\ncoker(Hn(C∗) ⊗F1 →Hn(C∗) ⊗F0)) = Hn(C∗) ⊗M\nand\nker(Hn-1(C∗) ⊗F1 →Hn-1(C∗) ⊗F0) = TorR\n1 (Hn-1(C∗), M) .\nWe have proved the following theorem.\nTheorem 24.1 (Universal Coefficient Theorem). Let R be a PID and C∗a chain complex of R-\nmodules such that Cn is free for all n. Then there is a natural short exact sequence of R-modules\n0 →Hn(C∗) ⊗M\nα-→Hn(C∗⊗M) ∂-→TorR\n1 (Hn-1(C∗), M) →0\nthat splits (but not naturally).\nExample 24.2. The pinch map RP2 →S2 induces the following map of universal coefficient short\nexact sequences:\n/ H2(RP2) ⊗Z/2Z\n\n/ H2(RP2; Z/2Z)\n∼\n=\n\n∼\n=\n/ Tor1(H1(RP2), Z/2Z)\n\n/ 0\n/ H2(S2) ⊗Z/2Z\n∼\n=\n/ H2(S2; Z/2Z)\n/ Tor1(H1(S2), Z/2Z)\n/ 0\nThis shows that the splitting of the universal coefficient short exact sequence cannot be made\nnatural, and it explains the mystery that we began with.\nExercise 24.3. The hypotheses are essential. Construct two counterexamples: one with R = Z\nbut in which the groups in the chain complex are not free, and one in which R = k[d]/d2 and the\nmodules in C∗are free over R.\nKunneth and Eilenberg-Zilber\nWe want to compute the homology of a product. Long ago, in Lecture 7, we constructed a bilinear\nmap Sp(X) × Sq(Y ) →Sp+q(X × Y ), called the cross product. So we get a linear map Sp(X) ⊗\nSq(Y ) →Sp+q(X × Y ), and it satisfies the Leibniz formula, i.e., d(x × y) = dx × y + (-1)px × dy.\nThe method we used works with any coefficient ring, not just the integers.\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nDefinition 25.1. Let C∗, D∗be two chain complexes. Their tensor product is the chain complex\nwith\n(C∗⊗D∗)n =\nM\np+q=n\nCp ⊗Dq .\nThe differential (C∗⊗D∗)n →(C∗⊗D∗)n-1 sends Cp⊗Dq into the submodule Cp-1⊗Dq\nL Cp⊗Dq-1\nby\nx ⊗y 7→dx ⊗y + (-1)px ⊗dy .\nSo the cross product is a map of chain complexes S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ) →S∗(X × Y ). There are two\nquestions:\n(1) Is this map an isomorphism in homology?\n(2) How is the homology of a tensor product of chain complexes related to the tensor product of\ntheir homologies?\nIt's easy to see what happens in dimension zero, because π0(X) × π0(Y ) = π0(X × Y ) implies\nthat H0(X) ⊗H0(Y )\n∼\n=\n-→H0(X × Y ).\nLet's dispose of the purely algebraic question (2) first.\nTheorem 25.2. Let R be a PID and C∗, D∗be chain complexes of R-modules. Assume that Cn is\na free R-module for all n. There is a short exact sequence\n0 →\nM\np+q=n\nHp(C) ⊗Hq(D) →Hn(C∗⊗D∗) →\nM\np+q=n-1\nTorR\n1 (Hp(C), Hq(D)) →0\nnatural in these data, that splits (but not naturally).\nProof. This is exactly the same as the proof for the UCT. It's a good idea to work through this on\nyour own.\nCorollary 25.3. Let R be a PID and assume C′\nn and Cn are R free for all n. If C′\n∗→C∗and\nD′\n∗→D∗are homology isomorphisms then so is C′\n∗⊗D′\n∗→C∗⊗D∗.\nOur attack on question (1) is via the method of \"acyclic models.\" This is really a special case of\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Homological Algebra, Theorem 22.1.\nDefinition 25.4. Let C be a category, and fix a set M of objects in C, to be called the \"models.\"\nA functor F : C →Ab is M-free if it is the free abelian group generated by a coproduct of\ncorepresentable functors.\nThat is, F is a direct sum of functors of the form ZC(M, -) where\nM ∈M.\nExample 25.5. Since we are interested in the singular homology of a product of two spaces, it\nmay be sensible to take as C the category of ordered pairs of spaces, C = Top2, and for M the set\nof pairs of simplicies, M = {(∆p, ∆q) : p, q ≥0}. Then\nSn(X × Y ) = Z[Top(∆n × X) × Top(∆n, Y )] = ZTop2((∆n, ∆n), (X, Y )) .\nis M-free.\nExample 25.6. With the same category and models,\n(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ))n =\nM\np+q=n\nSp(X) ⊗Sq(Y ) ,\n\n25. KUNNETH AND EILENBERG-ZILBER\nis M-free, since the tensor product has as free basis the set\na\np+q=n\nSinp(X) × Sinq(Y ) =\na\np+q=n\nTop2((∆p, ∆q), (X, Y )) .\nDefinition 25.7. A natural transformation of functors θ : F →G is an M-epimorphism if\nθM : F(M) →G(M) is a surjection of abelian groups for every M ∈M. A sequence of natu-\nral transformations is a composable pair G′ →G →G′′ with trivial composition. Let K be the\nobjectwise kernel of G →G′′. There is a factorization G′ →K. The sequence is M-exact if G′ →K\nis a M-epimorphism. Equivalently, G′(M) →G(M) →G′′(M) is exact for all M ∈M.\nExample 25.8. We claim that\n· · · →Sn(X × Y ) →Sn-1(X × Y ) →· · · →S0(X × Y ) →H0(X × Y ) →0\nis M-exact. Just plug in (∆p, ∆q): you get an exact sequence, since ∆p × ∆q is contractible.\nExample 25.9. The sequence\n· · · →(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ))n →(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ))n-1 →· · · →S0(X) ⊗S0(Y ) →H0(X) ⊗H0(Y ) →0 .\nis also M-exact, by Corollary 25.3.\nThe terms \"M-free\" and \"M-exact\" relate to each other in the expected way:\nLemma 25.10. Let C be a category with a set of models M and let F, G, G′ : C →Ab be functors.\nSuppose that F is M-free, let G′ →G be a M-epimorphism, and let f : F →G be any natural\ntransformation. Then there is a lifting:\nG′\n\nF\nf\n>\nf\n/ G\nProof. Clearly we may assume that F(X) = ZC(M, X). Suppose that X = M ∈M. We get:\nG′(M)\n\nZC(M, M)\nfM\nfM\n/ G(M)\nConsider 1M ∈ZC(M, M). Its image fM(1M) ∈G(M) is hit by some element in cM ∈G′(M),\nsince G′ →G is an M-epimorphism. Define fM(1M) = cM.\nNow we exploit naturality! Any φ : M →X produces a commutative diagram\nC(M, M)\nfM\n/\nφ∗\n\nG′(M)\nφ∗\n\nC(M, X)\nfX\n/ G′(X)\nChase 1M around the diagram, to see what the value of fX(φ) must be:\nfX(φ) = fX(φ∗(1M)) = φ∗(fM(1M)) = φ∗(cM) .\nNow extend linearly. You should check that this does define a natural transformation.\n\nCHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS\nThis is precisely the condition required to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Homological\nAlgebra. So we have the\nTheorem 25.11 (Acyclic Models). Let M be a set of models in a category C. Let θ : F →G be\na natural transformation of functors from C to Ab. Let F∗and G∗be functors from C to chain\ncomplexes, with augmentations F0 →F and G0 →G. Assume that Fn is M-free for all n, and that\nG∗→G →0 is an M-exact sequence. Then there is a unique chain homotopy class of chain maps\nF∗→G∗covering θ.\nCorollary 25.12. Suppose furthermore that θ is a natural isomorphism. If each Gn is M-free and\nF∗→F →0 is an M-exact sequence, then any natural chain map F∗→G∗covering θ is a natural\nchain homotopy equivalence.\nApplying this to our category Top2 with models as before, we get the following theorem that\ncompletes work we did in Lecture 7.\nTheorem 25.13 (Eilenberg-Zilber theorem). There are unique chain homotopy classes of natural\nchain maps:\nS∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ) ⇆S∗(X × Y )\ncovering the usual isomorphism\nH0(X) ⊗H0(Y ) ∼= H0(X × Y ) ,\nand they are natural chain homotopy inverses.\nCorollary 25.14. There is a canonical natural isomorphism H(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )) ∼= H∗(X × Y ).\nCombining this theorem with the algebraic Kunneth theorem, we get:\nTheorem 25.15 (Kunneth theorem). Take coefficients in a PID R. There is a short exact sequence\n0 →\nM\np+q=n\nHp(X) ⊗R Hq(Y ) →Hn(X × Y ) →\nM\np+q=n-1\nTorR\n1 (Hp(X), Hq(Y )) →0\nnatural in X, Y . It splits as R-modules, but not naturally.\nExample 25.16. If R = k is a field, every module is free, so the Tor term vanishes, and you get a\nKunneth isomorphism:\n× : H∗(X; k) ⊗k H∗(Y ; k)\n∼\n=\n-→H∗(X × Y ; k)\nThis is rather spectacular. For example, what is H∗(RP3 × RP3; k), where k is a field? Well,\nif k has characteristic different from 2, RP3 has the same homology as S3, so the product has the\nsame homology as S3 × S3: the dimensions are 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1. If char k = 2, on the other hand,\nthe cohomology modules are either 0 or k, and we need to form the graded tensor product:\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nso the dimensions of the homology of the product are 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\n25. KUNNETH AND EILENBERG-ZILBER\nThe palindromic character of this sequence will be explained by Poincare duality. Let's look\nalso at what happens over the integers. Then we have the table of tensor products\nZ\nZ/2Z\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ/2Z\nZ\nZ/2Z\nZ/2Z\nZ/2Z\nZ/2Z\nZ\nZ\nZ/2Z\nZ\nThere is only one nonzero Tor group, namely\nTorZ\n1 (H1(RP3), H1(RP3)) = Z/2Z.\nPutting this together, we get the groups\nH0\nZ\nH1\nZ/2Z ⊕Z/2Z\nH2\nZ/2Z\nH3\nZ ⊕Z ⊕Z/2Z\nH4\nZ/2Z ⊕Z/2Z\nH5\nH6\nZ\nThe failure of perfect symmetry here is interesting, and will also be explained by Poincare duality.\n\nChapter 3\nCohomology and duality\nCoproducts, cohomology\nThe next topic is cohomology. This is like homology, but it's a contravariant rather than covariant\nfunctor of spaces. There are three reasons why you might like a contravariant functor.\n(1) Many geometric contructions pull back; that is, they behave contravariantly. For example, if I\nhave some covering space e\nX →X and a map f : Y →X, I get a pullback covering space f∗e\nX.\nA better example is vector bundles (that we'll talk about in 18.906) - they don't push out, they\npullback. So if we want to study them by means of \"natural\" invariants, these invariants will have\nto lie in a (hopefully computable) group that also behaves contravariantly. This will lead to the\ntheory of characteristic classes.\n(2) The structure induced by the diagonal map from a space to its square induces stucture in\ncontravariant functors that is more general and easier to study.\n(3) Cohomology turns out to be the target of the Poincare duality map.\nLet's elaborate on point (2). Every space has a diagonal map\nX\n∆\n-→X × X .\nThis induces a map H∗(X; R) →H∗(X × X; R), for any coefficient group R. Now, if R is a ring,\nwe get a cross product map\n× : H∗(X; R) ⊗R H∗(X; R) →H∗(X × X; R) .\nIf R is a PID, the Kunneth Theorem tells us that this map is a monomorphism. If the remaining\nterm in the Kunneth Theorem is zero, the cross product is an isomorphism. So if H∗(X; R) is free\nover R (or even just flat over R), we get a \"diagonal\" or \"coproduct\"\n∆: H∗(X; R) →H∗(X; R) ⊗R H∗(X; R) .\nIf R is a field, this map is universally defined, and natural in X.\nThis kind of structure is unfamiliar, and at first seems a bit strange. After all, the tensor product\nis defined by a universal property for maps out of it; maps into it just are what they are.\nStill, it's often useful, and we pause to fill in some of its properties.\nDefinition 26.1. Let R be a ring. A (graded) coalgebra over R is a (graded) R-module M equipped\nwith a \"comultiplication\" ∆: M →M ⊗R M and a \"counit\" map ε : M →R such that the following\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\ndiagrams commute.\nM\n∆\n\n=\n'\n=\nw\nR ⊗R M\nM ⊗R M\nε⊗1\no\n1⊗ε / M ⊗R R\nM\n∆\n/\n∆\n\nM ⊗R M\n∆⊗1\n\nM ⊗R M\n1⊗∆/ M ⊗R M ⊗R M\nIt is commutative if in addition\nM\n∆\nz\n∆\n$\nM ⊗R M\nτ\n/ M ⊗R M\ncommutes, where τ(x ⊗y) = (-1)|x|·|y|y ⊗x is the twist map.\nUsing acyclic models, you saw for homework that the the Kunneth map is associative and\ncommutative: The diagrams\nS∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ) ⊗S∗(Z)\n×⊗1\n/\n1⊗×\n\nS∗(X × Y ) ⊗S∗(Z)\n×\n\nS∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y × Z)\n×\n/ S∗(X × Y × Z)\nand\nS∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )\nτ\n/\n×\n\nS∗(Y ) ⊗S∗(X)\n×\n\nS∗(X × Y )\nT∗\n/ S∗(Y × X)\ncommute up to natural chain homotopy, where τ is as defined above on the tensor product and\nT : X × Y →Y × X is the swap map. Similar diagrams apply to the standard comparison map for\nthe homology of tensor products of chain complexes,\nμ : H∗(C) ⊗H∗(D) →H∗(C ⊗D) ,\nand the result is this:\nCorollary 26.2. Suppose R is a PID and H∗(X; R) is free over R. Then H∗(X; R) has the natural\nstructure of a commutative graded coalgebra over R.\nWe could now just go on and talk about coalgebras. But they are less familiar, and available\nonly if H∗(X; R) is free over R. So instead we're going to dualize, talk about cohomology, and get\nan algebra structure. Some say that cohomology is better because you have algebras, but that's\nmore of a sociological statement than a mathematical one.\nLet's get on with it.\n\n26. COPRODUCTS, COHOMOLOGY\nDefinition 26.3. Let N be an abelian group. A singular n-cochain on X with values in N is a\nfunction Sinn(X) →N.\nIf N is an R-module, then I can extend linearly to get an R-module homomorphism Sn(X; R) →\nN.\nNotation 26.4. Write\nSn(X; N) = Map(Sinn(X), N) = HomR(Sn(X; R), N) .\nThis is going to give us something contravariant, that's for sure. But we haven't quite finished\ndualizing. The differential d : Sn+1(X; R) →Sn(X; R) induces a \"coboundary map\"\nd : Sn(X; N) →Sn+1(X; N)\ndefined by\n(df)(σ) = (-1)n+1f(dσ) .\nThe sign is a little strange, and we'll see an explanation in a minute. Anyway, we get a \"cochain\ncomplex,\" with a differential that increases degree by 1. We still have d2 = 0, since\n(d2f)(σ) = ±d(f(dσ)) = ±f(d2σ) = ±f(0) = 0 ,\nso we can still take homology of this cochain complex.\nDefinition 26.5. The nth singular cohomology group of X with coefficients in an abelian group N\nis\nHn(X; N) = ker(Sn(X; N) →Sn+1(X; N))\nim(Sn-1(X; N) →Sn(X; N)) .\nIf N is an R-module, then Hn(X; N) is again an R-module.\nLet's first compute H0(X; N). A 0-cochain is a function Sin0(X) →N; that is, a function (not\nrequired to be continuous!) f : X →N. To compute df, take a 1-simplex σ : ∆1 →X and evaluate\nf on its boundary:\n(df)(σ) = -f(dσ) = -f(σ(e0) -σ(e1)) = f(σ(e1)) -f(σ(e0)) .\nSo f is a cocycle if it's constant on path components. That is to say:\nLemma 26.6. H0(X; N) = Map(π0(X), N).\nWarning 26.7. Sn(X; Z) = Map(Sinn(X); Z) = Q\nSinn(X) Z, which is probably an uncountable\nproduct. An awkward fact is that this is never free abelian.\nThe first thing a cohomology class does is to give a linear functional on homology, by \"evaluation.\"\nLet's spin this out a bit.\nWe want to tensor together cochains and chains. But to do that we should make the differential\nin S∗(X) go down, not up. Just as a notational matter, let's write\nS∨\n-n(X; N) = Sn(X; N)\nand define a differential d : S∨\n-n(X) →S∨\n-n-1(X) to be the differential d : Sn(X) →Sn+1(X). Now\nS∨\n∗(X) is a chain complex, albeit a negatively graded one. Form the graded tensor product, with\nS∨\n∗(X; N) ⊗S∗(X)\n\nn =\nM\np+q=n\nS∨\np (X; N) ⊗Sq(X) .\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nNow evaluation is a map of graded abelian groups\n⟨-, -⟩: S∨\n∗(X; N) ⊗S∗(X) →N ,\nwhere N is regarded as a chain complex concentrated in degree 0. We would like this map to be a\nchain map. So let f ∈Sn(X; N) and σ ∈Sn(X), and compute\n0 = d⟨f, σ⟩= ⟨df, σ⟩+ (-1)n⟨f, dσ⟩.\nThis forces\n(df)(σ) = ⟨df, σ⟩= -(-1)nf(dσ) ,\nexplaining the odd sign in our definition above.\nHere's the payoff: There's a natural map\nH-n(S∨\n∗(X; N)) ⊗Hn(S∗(X))\nμ-→H0\nS∨\n∗(X; N) ⊗S∗(X)\n\n→N\nThis gives us the Kronecker pairing\n⟨-, -⟩: Hn(X; N) ⊗Hn(X) →N .\nWe can develop the properties of cohomology in analogy with properties of homology.\nFor\nexample: If A ⊆X, there is a restriction map Sn(X; N) →Sn(A; N), induced by the injection\nSinn(A) ,→Sinn(X). And as long as A is nonempty, we can split this injection, so any function\nSinn(A) →N extends to Sinn(X) →N. This means that Sn(X; N) →Sn(A; N) is surjective.\n(This is the case if A = ∅, as well!)\nDefinition 26.8. The relative n-cochain group with coefficients in N is\nSn(X, A; N) = ker (Sn(X; N) →Sn(A; N)) .\nThis defines a sub cochain complex of S∗(X; N), and we define\nHn(X, A; N) = Hn(S∗(X, A; N)) .\nThe short exact sequence of cochain complexes\n0 →S∗(X, A; N) →S∗(X; N) →S∗(A; N) →0\ninduces the long exact cohomology sequence\n· · ·\nH1(X, A; N)\n/ H1(X; N)\n/ H1(A; N)\nδ\nk\nH0(X, A; N)\n/ H0(X; N)\n/ H0(A; N) .\nδ\nk\n\n27. EXT AND UCT\nExt and UCT\nLet R be a ring (probably a PID) and N an R-module. The singular cochains on X with values in\nN,\nS∗(X; N) = Map(Sin∗(X), N) ,\nthen forms a cochain complex of R-modules. It is contravariantly functorial in X and covariantly\nfunctorial in N. The Kronecker pairing defines a map\nHn(X; N) ⊗R Hn(X; R) →N\nwhose adjoint\nβ : Hn(X; N) →HomR(Hn(X; R), N)\ngives us an estimate of the cohomology in terms of the homology of X. Here's how well it does:\nTheorem 27.1 (Mixed variance Universal Coefficient Theorem). Let R be a PID and N an R-\nmodule, and let C∗be a chain-complex of free R-modules. Then there is a short exact sequence of\nR-modules,\n0 →Ext1\nR(Hn-1(C∗), N) →Hn(HomR(C∗, N)) →HomR(Hn(C∗), N) →0 ,\nnatural in C∗and N, that splits (but not naturally).\nTaking C∗= S∗(X; R), we have the short exact sequence\n0 →Ext1\nR(Hn-1(X; R), N) →Hn(X; N)\nβ-→HomR(Hn(X; R), N) →0\nthat splits, but not naturally. This also holds for relative cohomology.\nWhat is this Ext?\nThe problem that arises is that HomR(-, N) : ModR →ModR is not exact. Suppose I have\nan injection M′ →M. Is Hom(M, N) →Hom(M′, N) surjective? Does a map M′ →N necessarily\nextend to a map M →N? No! For example, Z/2Z ,→Z/4Z is an injection, but the identity map\nZ/2Z →Z/2Z does not extend over Z/4Z.\nOn the other hand, if M′\ni-→M\np-→M′′ →0 is an exact sequence of R-modules then\n0 →HomR(M′′, N) →HomR(M, N) →HomR(M′, N)\nis again exact. Check this statement!\nNow homological algebra comes to the rescue to repair the failure of exactness. Pick a free\nresolution of M,\n0 ←M ←F0 ←F2 ←· · · .\nApply Hom(-, N) to get a cochain complex\n0 →HomR(F0, N) →HomR(F1, N) →HomR(F2, N) →· · · .\nDefinition 27.2. Extn\nR(M, N) = Hn(HomR(F∗, N)).\nRemark 27.3. Ext is well-defined and functorial, by the Fundamental Theorem of Homological\nAlgebra, Theorem 22.1. If M is free (or projective) then Extn\nR(M, -) = 0 for n > 0, since we can\ntake M as its own projective resolution. If R is a PID, then we can assume F1 = ker(F0 →M) and\nFn = 0 for n > 1, so Extn\nR = 0 if n > 1. If R is a field, then Extn\nR = 0 for n > 0.\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nExample 27.4. Let R = Z and take M = Z/kZ. This admits a simple free resolution: 0 →Z k-→\nZ →Z/kZ →0. Apply Hom(-, N) to it, and remember that Hom(Z, N) = N, to get the very\nshort cochain complex, with entries in dimensions 0 and 1:\n0 →N\nk-→N →0 .\nTaking homology gives us\nHom(Z/kZ, N) = ker(k|N)\nExt1(Z/kZ, N) = N/kN .\nProof of Theorem 27.1. First of all, we can't just copy the proof (in Lecture 24) of the homology\nuniversal coefficient theorem, since Ext1\nR(-, R) is not generally trivial.\nInstead, we start by thinking about what an n-cocycle in HomR(C∗, N) is: it's a homomorphism\nCn →N such that the composite Cn+1 →Cn →N is trivial. Write Bn ⊆Cn for the submodule of\nboundaries. We have a homomorphism that kills Bn; that is,\nZn(HomR(C∗, N))\n∼\n=\n-→HomR(Cn/Bn, N) .\nNow Hn(C∗) (which we'll abbreviate as Hn) is the submodule Zn/Bn of Cn/Bn; we have an exact\nsequence\n0 →Hn →Cn/Bn →Bn-1 →0 .\nApply HomR(-, N) to this short exact sequence. The result is again short exact, because Bn-1 is a\nsubmodule of the free R-module Cn-1 and hence is free. This gives us the bottom line in the map\nof short exact sequences\n/ Bn HomR(C∗, N)\n/\n\nZn HomR(C∗, N)\n∼\n=\n\n/ Hn(HomR(C∗, N))\nβ\n\n/ 0\n/ HomR(Bn-1, N)\n/ HomR(Cn/Bn, N)\n/ HomR(Hn, N)\n/ 0 .\nThe map β is the one we started with. The snake lemma now shows that it is surjective and that\nker β ∼= coker(Bn HomR(C∗, N) →HomR(Bn-1, N)) .\nAn element of Bn HomR(C∗, N) is a map Cn →N that factors as Cn\nd-→Cn-1 →N. The\nobservation is now that this is the same as factoring as Cn\nd-→Zn-1 →N; once this factorization\nhas been achieved, the map Zn-1 →N automatically extends to all of Cn-1.\nThis is because\nZn-1 ⊆Cn-1 as a direct summand: the short exact sequence\n0 →Zn-1 →Cn-1 →Bn-2 →0\nsplits since Bn-2 is free. Consequently we can rewrite our forumula for ker β as\nker β ∼= coker(HomR(Zn-1, N) →HomR(Bn-1, N)) .\nBut after all\n0 ←Hn-1 ←Zn-1 ←Bn-1 ←0\nis a free resolution, so this cokernel is precisely Ext1\nR(Hn-1(C∗), N).\n\n27. EXT AND UCT\nQuestion 27.5. Why is Ext called Ext?\nAnswer: It classifies extensions. Let R be a commutative ring, and let M, N be two R-modules. I\ncan think about \"extensions of M by N,\" that is, short exact sequences of the form\n0 →N →L →M →0 .\nFor example, I have two extensions of Z/2Z by Z/2Z:\n0 →Z/2Z →Z/2Z ⊕Z/2Z →Z/2Z →0\nand\n0 →Z/2Z →Z/4Z →Z/2Z →0 .\nWe'll say that two extensions are equivalent if there's a map of short exact sequences between them\nthat is the identity on N and on M. The two extensions above aren't equivalent, for example.\nAnother definition of Ext1\nR(M, N) is: the set of extensions like this modulo this notion of\nequivalence. The zero in the group is the split extension.\nThe universal coefficient theorem is useful in transferring properties of homology to cohomology.\nFor example, if f : X →Y is a map that induces an isomorphism in H∗(-; R), then it induces an\nisomorphism in H∗(-; N) for any R-module N, at least provided that R is a PID. (This is in fact\ntrue in general.)\nCohomology satisfies the appropriate analogues of the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms.\nHomotopy invariance: If f0 ≃f1 : (X, A) →(Y, B), then\nf∗\n0 = f∗\n1 : H∗(Y, B; N) →H∗(X, A; N) .\nI can't use the UCT to address this. But we established a chain homotopy f0,∗≃f1,∗: S∗(X, A) →\nS∗(Y, B), and applying Hom converts chain homotopies to cochain homotopies.\nExcision: If U ⊆A ⊆X such that U ⊆Int(A), then H∗(X, A; N) →H∗(X -U, A -U; N) is an\nisomorphism. This follows from excision in homology and the mixed variance UCT.\nMilnor axiom: The inclusions induce an isomorphism\nH∗(\na\nα\nXα; N) →\nY\nα\nH∗(Xα; N) .\nAs a result, it enjoys the fruit of these axioms, such as:\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence: If A, B ⊆X are such that their interiors cover X, then there is\na long exact sequence\nHn+1(X; N)\n/ · · ·\nHn(X; N)\n/ Hn(A; N) ⊕Hn(B; N)\n/ Hn(A ∩B; N)\nl\n· · ·\n/ Hn-1(A ∩B; N)\nl\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nProducts in cohomology\nWe'll talk about the cohomology cross product first. The first step is to produce a map on chains\nthat goes in the reverse direction from the cross product we constructed in Lecture 7.\nConstruction 28.1. For each pair of natural numbers p, q, we will define a natural homomorphism\nα : Sp+q(X × Y ) →Sp(X) ⊗Sq(Y ) .\nIt suffices to define this on simplices, so let σ : ∆p+q →X × Y be a singular (p + q)-simplex in the\nproduct. Let\nσ1 = pr1 *σ : ∆p+q →X\nand\nσ2 = pr2 *σ : ∆p+q →Y\nbe the two coordinates of σ. I have to produce a p-simplex in X and a q-simplex in Y .\nFirst define two maps in the simplex category:\n- the \"front face\" αp : [p] →[p + q], sending i to i for 0 ≤i ≤p, and\n- the \"back face\" ωq : [q] →[p + q], sending j to j + p for 0 ≤j ≤q.\nUse the same symbols for the affine extensions to maps ∆p →∆p+q and ∆q →∆p+q. Now let\nα(σ) = (σ1 *αp) ⊗(σ2 *ωq) .\nThis seems like a very random construction; but it works! It's named after two great early\nalgebraic topologists, James W. Alexander and Hassler Whitney. For homework, you will show that\nthese maps assemble into a chain map\nα : S∗(X × Y ) →S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ) .\nThis works over any ring R. To get a map in cohomology, we should form a composite\nSp(X; R)⊗RSq(Y ; R) →HomR(Sp(X; R)⊗RSq(Y ; R), R) α∗\n-→HomR(Sp+q(X×Y ; R), R) = Sp+q(X×Y ; R) .\nThe first map goes like this: Given chain complexes C∗and D∗, we can consider the dual cochain\ncomplexes HomR(C∗, R) and HomR(D∗, R), and construct a chain map\nHomR(C∗, R) ⊗R HomR(D∗, R) →HomR(C∗⊗R D∗, R)\nby\nf ⊗g 7→\n(\n(x ⊗y 7→(-1)pqf(x)g(y))\n|x| = |f| = p, |y| = |g| = q\notherwise.\nAgain, I leave it to you to check that this is a cochain map.\nAltogether, we have constructed a natural cochain map\n× : Sp(X) ⊗Sq(Y ) →Sp+q(X × Y )\nFrom this, we get a homomorphism\nH∗(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )) →H∗(X × Y ) .\nI'm not quite done! As in the Kunneth theorem, there is an evident natural map\nμ : H∗(X) ⊗H∗(Y ) →H∗(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )) .\n\n29. CUP PRODUCT, CONTINUED\nThe composite\n× : H∗(X) ⊗H∗(Y ) →H∗(S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y )) →H∗(X × Y )\nis the cohomology cross product.\nIt's not very easy to do computations with this, directly. We'll find indirect means. Let me\nmake some points about this construction, though.\nDefinition 28.2. The cup product is the map obtained by taking X = Y and composing with the\nmap induced by the diagonal ∆: X →X × X:\n∪: Hp(X) ⊗Hq(X) ×\n-→Hp+q(X × X) ∆∗\n--→Hp+q(X), .\nThese definitions make good sense with any ring for coefficients.\nLet's explore this definition in dimension zero. I claim that H0(X; R) ∼= Map(π0(X), R) as\nrings. When p = q = 0, both α0 and ω0 are the identity maps, so we are just forming the pointwise\nproduct of functions.\nThere's a distinguished element in H0(X), namely the the function π0(X) →R that takes on\nthe value 1 on every path component. This is the identity for the cup product. This comes about\nbecause when p = 0 in our above story, then α0 is just including the 0-simplex, and ωq is the\nidentity.\nThe cross product is also associative, even on the chain level.\nProposition 28.3. Let f ∈Sp(X), g ∈Sq(Y ), and h ∈Sr(Z), and let σ : ∆p+q+r →X × Y × Z\nbe any simplex. Then\n((f × g) × h)(σ) = (f × (g × h))(σ) .\nProof. Write σ12 for the composite of σ with the projection map X × Y × Z →X × Y , and so on.\nThen\n((f × g) × h)(σ) = (-1)(p+q)r(f × g)(σ12 *αp+q)h(σ3 *ωr) .\nBut\n(f × g)(σ12 *αp+q) = (-1)pqf(σ1 *αp)g(σ2 *μq) ,\nwhere μq is the \"middle face,\" sending lto l+ p for 0 ≤l≤q. In other words,\n((f × g) × h)(σ) = (-1)pq+qr+rpf(σ1 *αp)g(σ2 *μq)h(σ3 *ωr) .\nI've used associativity of the ring. You get exactly the same thing when you expand (f ×(g×h))(σ),\nso the cross product is associative.\nOf course the diagonal map is \"associative,\" too, and we find that the cup product is associative:\n(α ∪β) ∪γ = α ∪(β ∪γ) .\nCup product, continued\nWe have constructed an explicit map Sp(X) ⊗Sq(Y ) ×\n-→Sp+q(Y ) via:\n(f × g)(σ) = (-1)pqf(σ1 *αp)g(σ2 *ωq)\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nwhere αp : ∆p →∆p+q sends i to i for 0 ≤i ≤p and ωq : ∆q →∆p+q sends j to j +p for 0 ≤j ≤q.\nThis is a cochain map; it induces a \"cross product\" Hp(X) ⊗Hq(Y ) →Hp+q(X × Y ), and, by\ncomposing with the map induced by the diagonal embedding, the \"cup product\"\n∪: Hp(X) ⊗Hq(X) →Hp+q(X) .\nWe formalize the structure that this product imposes on cohomology.\nDefinition 29.1. Let R be a commutative ring.\nA graded R-algebra is a graded R-module\n. . . , A-1, A0, A1, A2, . . . equipped with maps Ap ⊗R Aq →Ap+q and a map η : R →A0 that\nmake the following diagram commute.\nAp ⊗R R\n1⊗η /\n=\n&\nAp ⊗R A0\n\nA0 ⊗R Aq\n\nR ⊗R Aq\nη⊗1\no\n=\nx\nAp\nAq\nAp ⊗R (Aq ⊗R Ar)\n/\n\nAp ⊗R Aq+r\n\nAp+q ⊗R Ar\n/ Ap+q+r\nA graded R-algebra A is commutative if the following diagram commutes:\nAp ⊗R Aq\nτ\n/\n%\nAq ⊗R Ap\ny\nAp+q\nwhere τ(x ⊗y) = (-1)pqy ⊗x.\nWe claim that H∗(X; R) forms a commutative graded R-algebra under the cup product. This\nis nontrivial. On the cochain level, this is clearly not graded commutative. We're going to have to\nwork hard - in fact, so hard that you're going to do it for homework. What needs to be checked is\nthat the following diagram commutes up to natural chain homotopy.\nS∗(X × Y )\nT∗\n/\nαX,Y\n\nS∗(Y × X)\nαY,X\n\nS∗(X) ⊗R S∗(Y )\nτ\n/ S∗(Y ) ⊗R S∗(X)\nAcyclic models helps us prove things like this.\nYou might hope that there is some way to produce a commutative product on a chain complex\nmodeling H∗(X). With coefficients in Q, this is possible, by a construction due to Dennis Sullivan.\nWith coefficients in a field of nonzero characteristic, it is not possible. Steenrod operations provide\nthe obstruction.\nMy goal now is to compute the cohomology algebras of some spaces. Some spaces are easy!\nThere is no choice for the product structure on H∗(Sn), for example. (When n = 0, we get a free\nmodule of rank 2 in dimension 0. This admits a variety of commutative algebra structures; but we\n\n29. CUP PRODUCT, CONTINUED\nhave already seen that H0(S0) = Z × Z as an algebra.) Maybe the next thing to try is a product\nof spheres. More generally, we should ask whether there is an algebra structure on H∗(X) ⊗H∗(Y )\nmaking the cross product an algebra map. If A and B are two graded algebras, there is a natural\nalgebra structure on A ⊗B, given by 1 = 1 ⊗1 and\n(a′ ⊗b′)(a ⊗b) = (-1)|b′|·|a|a′a ⊗b′b .\nIf A and B are commutative, then so is A ⊗B with this algebra structure.\nProposition 29.2. The cohomology cross product\n× : H∗(X) ⊗H∗(Y ) →H∗(X × Y )\nis an R-algebra homomorphism.\nProof. I have diagonal maps ∆X : X →X × X and ∆Y : Y →Y × Y . The diagonal on X × Y\nfactors as\nX × Y\n∆X×Y\n/\n∆X×∆Y\n(\nX × Y × X × Y\nX × X × Y × Y .\n1×T×1\nLet α1, α2 ∈H∗(X) and β1, β2 ∈H∗(Y ). Then α1 × β1, α2 × β2 ∈H∗(X × Y ), and I want to\ncalculate (α1 × β1) ∪(α2 × β2). Let's see:\n(α1 × β1) ∪(α2 × β2) = ∆∗\nX×Y (α1 × β1 × α2 × β2)\n= (∆X × ∆Y )∗(1 × T × 1)∗(α1 × β1 × α2 × β2)\n= (∆X × ∆Y )∗(α1 × T ∗(β1 × α2) × β2)\n= (-1)|α2|·|β1|(∆X × ∆Y )∗(α1 × α2 × β1 × β2) .\nNaturality of the cross product asserts that the diagram\nH∗(X × Y )\nH∗(X) ⊗R H∗(Y )\n×X×Y\no\nH∗(X × X × Y × Y )\n(∆X×∆Y )∗\nO\nH∗(X × X) ⊗H∗(Y × Y ) .\n×X×X,Y ×Y\no\n∆∗\nX⊗∆∗\nY\nO\ncommute. We learn:\n(α1 × β1) ∪(α2 × β2) = (-1)|α2|·|β1|(∆X × ∆Y )∗(α1 × α2 × β1 × β2)\n= (-1)|α2|·|β1|(α1 ∪α2) × (β1 ∪β2) .\nThat's exactly what we wanted.\nWe will see later, in Theorem 33.3, that the cross product map is often an isomorphism.\nExample 29.3. How about H∗(Sp × Sq)? I'll assume that p and q are both positive, and leave the\nother cases to you. The Kunneth theorem guarantees that × : H∗(Sp) ⊗H∗(Sq) →H∗(Sp × Sq)\nis an isomorphism. Write α for a generator of Sp and β for a generator of Sq; and use the same\nnotations for the pullbacks of these elements to Sp × Sq under the projections. Then\nH∗(Sp × Sq) = Z⟨1, α, β, α ∪β⟩,\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nand\nα2 = 0 ,\nβ2 = 0 ,\nαβ = (-1)pqβα .\nThis calculation is useful!\nCorollary 29.4. Let p, q > 0. Any map Sp+q →Sp × Sq induces the zero map in Hp+q(-).\nProof. Let f : Sp+q →Sp × Sq be such a map. It induces an algebra map f∗: H∗(Sp × Sq) →\nH∗(Sp+q). This map must kill α and β, for degree reasons. But then it also kills their product,\nsince f∗is multiplicative.\nThe space Sp ∨Sq ∨Sp+q has the same homology and cohomology groups as Sp × Sq. Both\nare built as CW complexes with cells in dimensions 0, p, q, and p + q. But they are not homotopy\nequivalent.\nWe can see this now because there is a map Sp+q →Sp ∨Sq ∨Sp+q inducing an\nisomorphism in Hp+q(-), namely, the inclusion of that summand.\nSurfaces and nondegenerate symmetric bilinear forms\nWe are aiming towards a proof of a fundamental cohomological property of manifolds.\nDefinition 30.1. A (topological) manifold is a Hausdorffspace such that every point has an open\nneighborhood that is homeomorphic to some (finite dimensional) Euclidean space.\nIf all these Euclidean spaces can be chosen to be Rn, we have an n-manifold.\nIn this lecture we will state a case of the Poincare duality theorem and study some consequences\nof it, especially for compact 2-manifolds. This whole lecture will be happening with coefficients in\nF2.\nTheorem 30.2. Let M be a compact manifold of dimension n. There exists a unique class [M] ∈\nHn(M), called the fundamental class, such that for every p, q with p + q = n the pairing\nHp(M) ⊗Hq(M) ∪-→Hn(M)\n⟨-,[M]⟩\n-----→F2\nis perfect.\nThis means that the adjoint map\nHp(M) →Hom(Hq(M), F2)\nis an isomorphism. Since cohomology vanishes in negative dimensions, one thing this implies is that\nHp(M) = 0 for p > n. Since M is compact, π0(M) is finite, and\nHn(M) = Hom(H0(M), F2) = Hom(Map(π0(M), F2), F2) = F2[π0(M)] .\nA vector space V admitting a perfect pairing V ⊗W →F2 is necessarily finite dimensional; so\nHp(M) is in fact finite-dimensional for all p.\nCombining this pairing with the universal coefficient theorem, we get isomorphisms\nHp(M)\n∼\n=\n-→Hom(Hp(M), F2)\n∼\n=\n←-Hq(M) .\nThe homology and cohomology classes corresponding to each other under this isomorphism are said\nto be \"Poincare dual.\"\n\n30. SURFACES AND NONDEGENERATE SYMMETRIC BILINEAR FORMS\nUsing these isomorphisms, the cup product pairing can be rewritten as a homology pairing:\nHp(M) ⊗Hq(M)\n⋔\n/\n∼\n=\n\nHn-p-q(M)\n∼\n=\n\nHn-p(M) ⊗Hn-q(M) ∪\n/ H2n-p-q(M) .\nThis is the intersection pairing. Here's how to think of it. Take homology classes α ∈Hp(M) and\nβ ∈Hq(M) and represent them (if possible!) as the image of the fundamental classes of submanifolds\nof M, of dimensions p and q. Move them if necessary to make them intersect \"transversely.\" Then\ntheir intersection will be a submanifold of dimension n -p -q, and it will represent the homology\nclass α ⋔β.\nThis relationship between the cup product and the intersection pairing is the source of the\nsymbol for the cup product.\nExample 30.3. Let M = T 2 = S1 × S1. We know that\nH1(M) = F2⟨a, b⟩\nand a2 = b2 = 0, while ab = ba generates H2(M). The Poincare duals of these classes are represented\nby cycles α and β wrapping around one or the other of the two factor circles. They can be made to\nintersect in a single point. This reflects the fact that\n⟨a ∪b, [M]⟩= 1 .\nSimilarly, the fact that a2 = 0 reflects the fact that its Poincare dual cycle α can be moved so as\nnot to intersect itself. The picture below shows two possible α's.\nThis example exhibits a particularly interesting fragment of the statement of Poincare duality:\nIn an even dimensional manifold - say n = 2k - the cup product pairing gives us a nondegenerate\nsymmetric bilinear form on Hk(M).\nAs indicated above, this can equally well be considered a\nbilinear form on Hk(M), and it is then to be thought of as describing the number of points (mod\n2) two k-cycles intersect in, when put in general position relative to one another. It's called the\nintersection form. We'll denote it by\nα · β = ⟨a ∪b, [M]⟩,\nwhere again a and α are Poincare dual, and b and β are dual.\nExample 30.4. In terms of the basis α, β, the intersection form for T 2 has matrix\n\n.\nThis is a \"hyperbolic form.\"\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nLet's discuss finite dimensional nondegenerate symmetric bilinear forms over F2 in general. A\nform on V restricts to a form on any subspace W ⊆V , but the restricted form may be degenerate.\nAny subspace has an orthogonal complement\nW ⊥= {v ∈V : v · w = 0 for all w ∈W} .\nLemma 30.5. The restriction of a nondegenerate bilinear form on V to a subspace W is nonde-\ngenerate exactly when W ∩W ⊥= 0. In that case W ⊥is also nondegenerate, and the splitting\nV ∼= W ⊕W ⊥\nrespects the forms.\nUsing this easy lemma, we may inductively decompose a general (finite dimensional) symmetric\nbilinear form. First, if there is a vector v ∈V such that v · v = 1, then it generates a nondegenerate\nsubspace and\nV = ⟨v⟩⊕⟨v⟩⊥.\nContinuing to split offone-dimensional subspaces brings us to the situation of a nondegenerate\nsymmetric bilinear form such that v · v = 0 for every vector. Unless V = 0 we can pick a nonzero\nvector v. Since the form is nondegenerate, we may find another vector w such that v · w = 1. The\ntwo together generate a 2-dimensional hyperbolic subspace. Split it offand continue. We conclude:\nProposition 30.6. Any finite dimensional nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form over F2 splits\nas an orthogonal direct sum of forms with matrices [1] and\n\n.\nLet Bil be the set of isomorphism classes of finite dimensional nondegenerate symmetric bilinear\nforms over F2. We've just given a classification of these things. This is a commutative monoid under\northogonal direct sum. It can be regarded as the set of nonsingular symmetric matrices modulo the\nequivalence relation of \"similarity\": Two matrices M and N are similar if N = AMAT for some\nnonsingular A.\nClaim 30.7.\n\n∼\n\nProof. This is the same thing as saying that\n\n= AAT for some nonsingular A. Let\nA =\n\n.\nIt's easy to see that there are no further relations; Bil is the commutative monoid with two\ngenerators I and H, subject to the relation I + H = 3I.\nLet's go back to topology. Let n = 2. Then you get an intersection pairing on H1(M). Consider\nRP2. We know that H1(RP2) = F2. This must be the form we labelled I. This says that anytime\nyou have a nontrivial cycle on a projective plane, there's nothing you can do to remove its self\ninteresections. You can see this. The projective plane is a Mobius band with a disk sown on along\n\n31. LOCAL COEFFICIENTS AND ORIENTATIONS\nthe boundary. The waist of the Mobius band serves as a generating cycle. The observation is that\nif this cycle is moved to intersect itself tranversely, it must intersect itself an odd number of times.\nWe can produce new surfaces from old by a process of \"addition.\" Given two connected surfaces\nΣ1 and Σ2, cut a disk out of each one and sew them together along the resulting circles. This is the\nconnected sum Σ1#Σ2.\nProposition 30.8. There is an isomorphism\nH1(Σ1#Σ2) ∼= H1(Σ1) ⊕H1(Σ2)\ncompatible with the intersection forms.\nProof. Let's compute the cohomology of Σ1#Σ2 using Mayer-Vietoris. The two dimensional coho-\nmology of Σi -D2 vanishes because the punctured surface retracts onto its 1-skeleton. The relevant\nfragment is\n0 →H1(Σ1#Σ2) →H1(Σ1 -D2) ⊕H1(Σ2 -D2) →H1(S1) δ-→H2(Σ1#Σ2) →0 .\nThe boundary map must be an isomorphism, because the connected sum is a compact connected\nsurface so has nontrivial H2. We leave the verification that the direct sum is orthogonal to you.\nWrite Surf for the set of homeomorphism classes of compact connected surfaces. Connected\nsum provides it with the structure of a commutative monoid. The classification of surfaces may\nnow be summarized as folows:\nTheorem 30.9. Formation of the intersection bilinear form gives an isomorphism of commutative\nmonoids Surf →Bil.\nThis is a kind of model result of algebraic topology! - a complete algebraic classification of a\nclass of geometric objects. The oriented surfaces correspond to the bilinear forms of type gH; g is\nthe genus. But it's a little strange. We must have a relation corresponding to H ⊕I = 3I, namely\nT 2#RP2 ∼= (RP2)#3 .\nYou should verify this for yourself!\nThere's more to be said about this. Away from characteristic 2, symmetric bilinear forms and\nquadratic forms are interchangeable. But over F2 you can ask for a quadratic form q such that\nq(x + y) = q(x) + q(y) + x · y .\nThis is a \"quadratic refinement\" of the symmetric bilinear form. Of course it implies that x · x = 0\nfor all x, so this will correspond to some further structure on an oriented surface. This structure is a\n\"framing,\" a trivialization of the normal bundle of an embedding into a high dimensional Euclidean\nspace. There are then further invariants of this framing; this is the story of the Kervaire invariant.\nLocal coefficients and orientations\nThe fact that a manifold is locally Euclidean puts surprising constraints on its cohomology, captured\nin the statement of Poincare duality. To understand how this comes about, we have to find ways to\npromote local information - like the existence of Euclidean neighborhoods - to global information -\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nlike restrictions on the structure of the cohomology. Today we'll study the notion of an orientation,\nwhich is the first link between local and global.\nThe local-to-global device relevant to this is the notion of a \"local coefficient system,\" which is\nbased on the more primitive notion of a covering space. We merely summarize that theory, since it\nis a prerequisite of this course.\nDefinition 31.1. A continuous map p : E →B is a covering space if\n(1) every point pre-image is a discrete subspace of E, and\n(2) every b ∈B has a neighborhood V admitting a map p-1(V ) →p-1(b) such that the induced\nmap\np-1(V )\n∼\n=\n/\np\n#\nV × p-1(b)\npr1\ny\nB\nis a homeomorphism.\nThe space B is the \"base,\" E the \"total space.\"\nExample 31.2. A first example is given by the projection map pr1 : B × F →B where F is\ndiscrete. A covering space of this form is said to be trivial, so the covering space condition can be\nrephrased as \"local triviality.\"\nThe first interesting example is the projection map Sn →RPn obtained by identifying antipodal\nmaps on the sphere. This example generalizes in the following way.\nDefinition 31.3. An action of a group π on a space X is principal or totally discontinuous (terrible\nlanguage, since we are certainly assuming that every group element acts by homeomorphisms)\nprovided every element x ∈X has a neighborhood U such that the only time U and gU intersect is\nwhen g = 1.\nThis is a strong form of \"freeness\" of the action. It is precisely what is needed to guarantee:\nLemma 31.4. If π acts principally on X then the orbit projection map X →π\\X is a covering\nspace.\nIt is not hard to use local triviality to prove the following:\nTheorem 31.5 (Unique path lifting). Let p : E →B be a covering space, and ω : I →B a path\nin the base. For any e ∈E such that p(e) = ω(0), there is a unique path eω : I →E in E such that\npeω = ω and eω(0) = e.\nThis leads to a right action of π1(B, b) on F = p-1(b): Represent an element of π1(B) by a loop\nω; for an element e ∈p-1(b) let eω be the lift of ω with eω(0) = e; and define\ne · [ω] = eω(1) ∈E .\nThis element lies in F because ω was a loop, ending at b. One must check that this action by\n[ω] ∈π1(B, b) does not depend upon the choice of representative ω, and that we do indeed get a\nright action:\ne · (ab) = (e · a) · b ,\ne · 1 = e .\nGiven a principal π-action on X, with orbit space B, we can do more than just form the orbit\nspace! If we also have a right action of π on a set F, we can form a new covering space over B with\n\n31. LOCAL COEFFICIENTS AND ORIENTATIONS\nF as \"generic\" fiber. Write F ×π X for the quotient of the product space F × X by the equivalence\nrelation\n(s, gx) ∼(sg, x) ,\ng ∈π .\nThe composite projection F × X →X →B factors through a map F ×π X →B, which is easily\nseen to be a covering space. Any element x ∈X determines a homeomorphism\nF →p-1p(x)\nby\ns 7→[s, x] .\nOf course ∗×π X = B, and if we let π act on itself by right translation, π ×π X = X.\nCovering spaces of a fixed space B form a category CovB, in which a morphism E′ →E is\n\"covering transformation,\" that is, a map f : E′ →E making\nE′\nf\n/\n\nE\n\nB\ncommute. Sending p : E →B to p-1(b) with its action by π1(B, b) gives a functor\nCovB →Set-π1(B, b)\nto the category of right actions of π1(B, b) on sets. For connected spaces, this is usually an equiv-\nalence of categories. The technical assumption required is this: A space B is semilocally simply\nconnected if is path connected and for every point b and every neighborhood U of b, there exists a\nsmaller neighborhood V such that π1(V, b) →π1(X, b) is trivial. This is a very weak condition.\nTheorem 31.6. Assume that B is semi-locally simply connected.\nThen the functor CovB →\nSet-π1(B, b) is an equivalence of categories.\nThis is another one of those perfect theorems in algebraic topology!\nThe covering space corresponding under this equivalence to the translation action of π1(B, b) on\nitself is the universal cover of B, denoted by eB →B. It is simply connected. Since the automorphism\ngroup of π as a right π-set is π (acting by left translation), the automorphism group of eB →B as\na covering space of B is π1(B, b). This action is principal, and the covering space corresponding to\na π1(B, b)-set S is given by the balanced product S ×π1(B,b) eB.\nCovering spaces come up naturally in our study of topological manifolds. For any space X,\nwe can probe the structure of X in the neighborhood of x ∈X by studying the graded R-module\nH∗(X, X -x; R), the local homology of X at x.\nBy excision, this group depends only on the\nstructure of X \"locally at x\": For any neighborhood U of x, excising the complement of U gives an\nisomorphism\nH∗(U, U -x)\n∼\n=\n-→H∗(X, X -x) .\nWhen the space is an n-manifold - let's write M for it - the local homology is very simple. It's\nnonzero only in dimension n. This has a nice immediate consequence, by the way: there is a well-\ndefined locally constant function dim : M →N, sending x to the dimension in which H∗(M, M -x)\nis nontrivial. For an n-manifold, it's the constant function with value n.\nIn fact the whole family of homology groups Hn(M, M -x) is \"locally constant.\" This is captured\nin the statement that taken together, as x varies over M, they constitute a covering space over M.\nSo begin by defining\noM =\na\nx∈M\nHn(M, M -x)\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nas sets. There is an evident projection map p : oM →M. We aim to put a topology on oM with\nthe property that this map is a covering space. This will use an important map jA,x, defined for\nany closed set A ⊆M and x ∈A as the map induced by an inclusion of pairs:\njA,x : Hn(M, M -A) →Hn(M, M -x)\nDefine a basis of opens VU,x,α in oM indexed by triples (U, x, α) where U is open in M, x ∈U, and\nα ∈Hn(M, M -U):\nVU,x,α = {jU,x(α) : x ∈U} .\nEach α ∈Hn(M, M -U) thus defines a \"sheet\" of oM over U. We leave it to you to check that this\nis indeed a covering space.\nThis covering space has more structure: each fiber is an abelian group, an infinite cyclic abelian\ngroup. These structures vary continuously as you move from one fiber to another. To illuminate this\nstructure, observe that the category CovB has finite products; they are given by the fiber product\nor pullback, E′ ×B E →B. The empty product is the terminal object, B →B. This lets us define\nan \"abelian group object\" in CovB; it's an object E →B together with maps E ×B E →E and\nB →E over B, satisfying some evident conditions that are equivalent to requiring that they render\neach fiber an abelian group. If you have a ring around you can also ask for a map (B×R)×B E →E\nmaking each fiber an R-module.\nThe structure we have defined is a local coefficient system (of R-modules). We already have an\nexample; if M is an n-manifold, we have the orientation local system oM over M.\nIt's useful to allow coefficients in a commutative ring R; so denote by\noM ⊗R\nthe local system of R-modules obtained by tensoring each fiber with R.\nThe classification theorem for covering spaces has as a corollary:\nTheorem 31.7. Let B be path connected and semi-locally simply connected. Then forming the\nfiber over a point gives an equivalence of categories from the category of local coefficient systems of\nR-modules over B and the category of modules over the group algebra R[π1(B, b)].\nThe fibers of our local coefficient system oM are quite simple: they are free of rank 1. Since any\nautomorphism of such an R-module is given by multiplication by a unit in R, we find that the local\ncoefficient system is defined by giving a homomorphism\nπ1(M, b) →R×\nor, what is the same, an element of H1(M; R×).\nWhen R = Z, this homomorphism\nw1 : π1(M, b) →{±1}\nis the \"first Stiefel-Whitney class.\" If it is trivial, you can pick consistent generators for Hn(M, M-x)\nas x runs over M: the manifold is \"orientable,\" and is oriented by one of the two possible choices. If it\nis nontrivial, the manifold is nonorientable. I hope it's clear that the Mobius band is nonorientable,\nand hence any surface containing the Mobius band is as well.\nThe set of abelian group generators of the fibers of oM form a sub covering space, a double cover\nof M, denoted by o×\nM. It is the \"orientation double cover.\" If M is orientable (and connected) it\nis trivial; it consists of two copies of M. An orientation consists in chosing one or the other of the\n\n31. LOCAL COEFFICIENTS AND ORIENTATIONS\ncomponents. If M is nonorientable (and connected) the orientation double cover is again connected.\nAn interesting and simple fact is that its total space is a manifold in its own right, and is orientable;\nin fact it carries a canonical orientation.\nSimilarly we can form the sub covering space of R-module generators of the fibers of oM ⊗R;\nwrite (oM ⊗R)× for it.\nNow if p : E →B is a covering space, one of the things you may want to do is consider a section\nof p; that is, a continuous function σ : B →E such that p *σ = 1B. Write Γ(B; E) for the set of\nsections of p : E →B. Under the corresondence between covering spaces and actions of π,\nΓ(B; E) = (p-1(b))π1(B,b) ,\nthe fixed point set for the action of π1(B, b) on p-1(b). If E is a local system of R-modules, this is\na sub R-module.\nA \"local R-orientation at x\" is a choice of R-module generator of Hn(M, M -x; R), and we make\nthe following definition.\nDefinition 31.8. An R-orientation of an n-manifold M is a section of (oM ⊗R)×.\nFor example, when R = F2, every manifold is orientable, and uniquely so, since F×\n2 = {1}. A\nZ-orientation (or simply \"orientation\") is a section of the orientation double cover. A manifold is\n\"R-orientable\" if it admits an R-orientation. A connected n-manifold is either non-orientable, or\nadmits two orientations. Euclidean space is orientable.\nThis relates to the \"globalization\" project we started out talking about. A section over B is in\nfact called a \"global section.\" In the case of the orientation local system, we have a canonical map\nj : Hn(M; R) →Γ(M; oM ⊗R) ,\ndescribed as follows. The value of j(a) at x ∈M is the restriction of a to Hn(M, M -x). The first\n\"local-to-global\" theorem, a special case of Poincare duality, is this:\nTheorem 31.9 (Orientation Theorem). If M is compact, the map j : Hn(M; R) →Γ(M; oM ⊗R)\nis an isomorphism.\nWe will prove this theorem in the next lecture.\nThe representation of π1(B) on the fiber of oM ⊗R over b is given by the composite π1(B) →\n{±1} →R×. If this is the trivial homomorphism, the fixed points of this representation on R form\nall of R. If not, the fixed points are the subgroup of R of elements of order 2, written R[2].\nCorollary 31.10. If M is a compact connected n-manifold, then\nHn(M; R) ∼=\n(\nR\nif M is orientable\nR[2]\nif not .\nIn the first case, a generator of Hn(M; R) is a fundamental class for the manifold. You should\nthink of the manifold itself as a cycle representing this homology class. It is characterized as a class\nrestricting to a generator of Hn(M, M -x) for all x; this is saying that the cycle \"covers\" the point\nx once.\nThe first isomorphism in the theorem depends upon this choice of fundamental class. But in the\nsecond case, the isomorphism is canonical. Over F2, any compact connected manifold has a unique\nfundamental class, the generator of Hn(M; F2) = F2.\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nProof of the orientation theorem\nWe are studying the way in which local homological information gives rise to global information,\nespecially on an n-manifold M. The tool was the map\nj : Hn(M; R) →Γ(M; oM ⊗R)\nsending a class c to the section of the orientation local coefficient system given at x ∈M by the\nrestriction jx(c) ∈Hn(M, M -x). We asserted that if M is compact then j is an isomorphism and\nthat Hq(M) = 0 for q > n. The proof will be by induction.\nTo make the induction go, we will need a refinement of this construction. Let A ⊆M be a\ncompact subset. A class in Hn(M, M -A) is represented by a cycle whose boundary lies outside\nof A. It may cover A evenly. We can give meaning to this question as follows. Let x ∈A. Then\nM -A ⊆M -x, so we have a map\njA,x : Hn(M, M -A) →Hn(M, M -x)\nthat tests whether the chain covers x. As x ranges over A, these maps together give us a map to\nthe group of sections of oM over A,\njA : Hn(M, M -A) →Γ(A; oM) .\nBecause Hn(M, M -A) deals with homology classes that \"stretch over A,\" we will write\nHn(M, M -A) = Hn(M|A) .\nTheorem 32.1. Let M be an n-manifold and let A be a compact subset of M. Then Hq(M|A; R) = 0\nfor q > n, and the map jA : Hn(M|A; R) →Γ(A; oM ⊗R) is an isomorphism.\nTaking A = M (assuming M compact) we find that Hq(M; R) = 0 for q > n and\njM : Hn(M; R)\n∼\n=\n-→Γ(M; oM ⊗R) .\nBut the theorem covers much more exotic situations as well; perhaps A is a Cantor set in some\nEuclidean space, for example.\nWe follow [2] in proving this, and refer you to that reference for the modifications appropriate\nfor the more general statement when A is assumed merely closed rather than compact.\nFirst we establish two general results.\nProposition 32.2. Let A and B be closed subspaces of M, and suppose the result holds for A, B,\nand A ∩B. Then it holds for A ∪B.\nProof. The relative Mayer-Vietoris theorem and the hypothesis that Hn+1(M|A ∩B) = 0 gives us\nexactness of the top row in the ladder\n/ Hn(M|A ∪B)\njA∩B\n\n/ Hn(M|A) ⊕Hn(M|B)\njA⊕jB\n\n/ Hn(M|A ∩B)\njA∩B\n\n/ Γ(A ∪B; oM)\n/ Γ(A; oM) ⊕Γ(B; oM)\n/ Γ(A ∩B; oM) .\nExactness of the bottom row is clear: A section over A ∪B is precisely a section over A and a\nsection over B that agree on the intersection. So the five-lemma shows that jA∪B is an isomorphism.\nLooking further back in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence gives the vanishing of Hq(M|A) for q > n.\n\n32. PROOF OF THE ORIENTATION THEOREM\nProposition 32.3. Let A1 ⊇A2 ⊇· · · be a decreasing sequence of compact subsets of M, and\nassume that the theorem holds for each An. Then it holds for the intersection A = T Ai.\nThe proof of this proposition entails two lemmas, which we'll dispose of first.\nLemma 32.4. Let A1 ⊇A2 ⊇· · · be a decreasing sequence of compact subsets of a space X, with\nintersection A. Then\nlim\n-→\ni\nHq(X, X -Ai)\n∼\n=\n-→Hq(X, X -A) .\nProof. Let σ : ∆q →X be any q-simplex in X -A. The subsets X -Ai form an open cover of\nim(σ), so by compactness it lies in some single X -Ai. This shows that\nlim\n-→\ni\nSq(X -Ai)\n∼\n=\n-→Sq(X -A) .\nThus\nlim\n-→\ni\nSq(X|Ai)\n∼\n=\n-→Sq(X|Ai)\nby exactness of direct limit, and the claim then follows for the same reason.\nLemma 32.5. Let A1 ⊇A2 ⊇· · · be a decreasing sequence of compact subsets in a Hausdorffspace\nX with intersection A. For any open neighborhood U of A there exists i such that Ai ⊆U.\nProof. A is compact, being a closed subset of the compact Hausdorffspace A1. Since A is the\nintersection of the Ai, and A ⊆U, the intersection of the decreasing sequence of compact sets\nAi -U is empty. Thus by the finite intersection property one of them must be empty; but that says\nthat Ai ⊆U.\nProof of Proposition 32.3. By Lemma 32.4, Hq(M|A) = 0 for q > n. In dimension n, we contem-\nplate the commutative diagram\nlim\n-→\ni\nHn(M|Ai)\n∼\n=\n/\n∼\n=\n\nHn(M|A)\n\nlim\n-→\ni\nΓ(Ai; oM)\n∼\n=\n/ Γ(A; oM) .\nThe top map an isomorphism by Lemma 32.4.\nTo see that the bottom map is an isomorphism, we'll verify the two conditions for a map to be a\ndirect limit from Lecture 23. First let x be a section of oM over A. By compactness, we may cover\nA by a finite set of opens over each of which oM is trivial. The section extends over their union U,\nby unique path lifting. By Lemma 32.5 this open set contains some Ai, and we conclude that any\nsection over A extends to some Ai.\nOn the other hand, suppose that a section x ∈Γ(Ai; oM) vanishes on A. Then it vanishes on\nsome open set containing A, again by unique path lifting and local triviality. Some Aj lies in that\nopen set, again by Lemma 32.5. We may assume that j ≥i, and conclude that x already vanishes\non Aj.\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nProof of Theorem 32.1. There are five steps. In describing them, we will call a subset of M \"Eu-\nclidean\" if it lies inside some open set homeomorphic to Rn.\n(1) M = Rn, A a compact convex subset.\n(2) M = Rn, A a finite union of compact convex subsets.\n(3) M = Rn, A any compact subset.\n(4) M arbitrary, A a finite union of compact Euclidean subsets.\n(5) M arbitrary, A an arbitrary compact subset.\nNotes on the proofs: (1) To be clear, \"convex\" implies nonempty. By translating A, we may\nassume that 0 ∈A. The compact subset A lies in some disk, and by a homothety we may assume\nthat the disk is the unit disk Dn.\nThen we claim that the inclusion i : Sn-1 →Rn -A is a\ndeformation retract. A retraction is given by r(x) = x/||x||, and a homotopy from ir to the identity\nis given by\nh(x, t) =\n\nt + 1 -t\n||x||\n\nx .\nIt follows that Hq(Rn, Rn -A) ∼= Hq(Rn, Rn -Dn) for all q. This group is zero for q > n.\nIn dimension n, note that restricting to the origin gives an isomorphism Hn(Rn, Rn -Dn) →\nHn(Rn, Rn -0) since Rn -D is a deformation retract of Rn -0. The local system oRn is trivial,\nsince Rn is simply connected, so restricting to the origin gives an isomorphism Γ(Dn, oRn) →\nHn(Rn, Rn -0). This implies that jDn : Hn(Rn, Rn -Dn) →Γ(Dn, oRn) is an isomorphism. The\nrestriction Γ(Dn, oRn) →Γ(A, oRn) is also an isomorphism, since A →Dn is a deformation retract.\nSo by the commutative diagram\nHn(Rn, Rn -Dn)\n∼\n=\n/\njDn\n\nHn(Rn, Rn -A)\njA\n\nΓ(Dn, oRn)\n/ Γ(A, oRn)\nwe find that jA : Hn(Rn, Rn -A) →Γ(A; oRn) is an isomorphism.\n(2) by Proposition 32.2.\n(3) For each j ≥1, let Cj be a finite subset of A such that\nA ⊆\n[\nx∈Cj\nB1/j(x) .\nSince any intersection of convex sets is either empty or convex,\nAk =\nk\\\nj=1\n[\nx∈Cj\nB1/j(x)\nis a union of finitely many convex sets, and since A is closed it is the intersection of this decreasing\nfamily. So the result follows from (1), (2), and Proposition 32.3.\n(4) by (3) and (2).\n(5) Cover A by finitely many open subsets that embed in Euclidean opens as open disks with\ncompact closures. Their closures then form a finite cover by closed Euclidean disks Di in Euclidean\nopens Ui. For each i, excise the closed subset M -Ui to see that\nHq(M, M -A ∩Di) ∼= Hq(Ui, Ui -A ∩Di) ∼= Hq(Rn, Rn -A ∩Di) .\nBy (4), the theorem holds for each of these. Each intersection (A∩Di)∩(A∩Dj) is again a compact\nEuclidean subset, so the result holds for them by excision as well. The result then follows by (1).\n\n33. A PLETHORA OF PRODUCTS\nA plethora of products\nWe are now heading towards a statement of Poincare duality.\nRecall that we have the Kronecker pairing\n⟨-, -⟩: Hp(X; R) ⊗Hp(X; R) →R .\nIt's obviously not \"natural,\" because Hp is contravariant while homology is covariant. But given\nf : X →Y , b ∈Hp(Y ), and x ∈Hp(X), we can ask: How does ⟨f∗b, x⟩relate to ⟨b, f∗x⟩?\nClaim 33.1. ⟨f∗b, x⟩= ⟨b, f∗x⟩.\nProof. This is easy! I find it useful to write out diagrams to show where things are. We're going to\nwork on the chain level.\nHom(Sp(Y ), R) ⊗Sp(X)\n1⊗f∗/\nf∗⊗1\n\nHom(Sp(Y ), R) ⊗Sp(Y )\n⟨-,-⟩\n\nHom(Sp(X), R) ⊗Sp(X)\n⟨-,-⟩\n/ R\nWe want this diagram to commute. Suppose [β] = b and [ξ] = x. Then going to the right and then\ndown gives\nβ ⊗ξ 7→β ⊗f∗(ξ) 7→β(f∗ξ) .\nThe other way gives\nβ ⊗ξ 7→f∗(β) ⊗ξ = (β *f∗) ⊗ξ 7→(β *f∗)(ξ) .\nThis is exactly β(f∗ξ).\nThere's actually another product in play here:\nμ : H(C∗) ⊗H(D∗) →H(C∗⊗D∗)\ngiven by [c]⊗[d] 7→[c⊗d]. I used it to pass from the chain level computation we did to the homology\nstatement.\nWe also have the two cross products:\n× : Hp(X) ⊗Hq(Y ) →Hp+q(X × Y )\nand\n× : Hp(X) ⊗Hq(Y ) →Hp+q(X × Y ) .\nYou might think this is fishy because both maps are in the same direction. But it's OK, because we\nused different things to make these constructions: the chain-level cross product (or Eilenberg-Zilber\nmap) for homology and the Alexander-Whitney map for cohomology. Still, they're related:\nLemma 33.2. Let a ∈Hp(X), b ∈Hq(Y ), x ∈Hp(X), y ∈Hq(Y ). Then:\n⟨a × b, x × y⟩= (-1)|x|·|b|⟨a, x⟩⟨b, y⟩.\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nProof. Look at the chain-level cross product and the Alexander-Whitney maps:\n× : S∗(X) ⊗S∗(Y ) ⇆S∗(X × Y ) : α\nThey are inverse isomorphisms in dimension 0, and both sides are projective resolutions with respect\nto the models (∆p, ∆q); so by acyclic models they are natural chain homotopy inverses.\nSay [f] = a, [g] = b, [ξ] = x, [η] = y. Write fg for the composite\nSp(X) ⊗Sq(Y ) ×\n-→Sp+q(X × Y )\nf⊗g\n--→R ⊗R →R .\nThen:\n(f × g)(ξ × η) = (fg)α(ξ × η) ≃(fg)(ξ ⊗η) = (-1)pqf(ξ)g(η) .\nWe can use this to prove a restricted form of the Kunneth theorem in cohomology.\nTheorem 33.3. Let R be a PID. Assume that Hp(X) is a finitely generated free R-module for all\np. Then\n× : H∗(X; R) ⊗R H∗(Y ; R) →H∗(X × Y ; R)\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. Write M∨for the linear dual of an R-module M. By our assumption about Hp(X), the map\nHp(X)∨⊗Hq(Y )∨→(Hp(X) ⊗Hq(Y ))∨,\nsending f ⊗g to (x ⊗y 7→(-1)pqf(x)g(y)), is an isomorphism. The homology Kunneth theorem\nguarantees that the bottom map in the following diagram is an isomorphism.\nL\np+q=n Hp(X) ⊗Hq(Y )\n×\n/\n∼\n=\n\nHn(X × Y )\n∼\n=\n\nL\np+q=n Hp(X)∨⊗Hq(Y )∨\n∼\n=\n/\nL\np+q=n Hp(X) ⊗Hq(Y )\n∨\nHn(X × Y )∨\n∼\n=\no\nCommutativity of this diagram is exactly the content of Lemma 33.2.\nWe saw before that × is an algebra map, so under the conditions of the theorem it is an\nisomorphism of algebras. You do need some finiteness assumption, even if you are working over a\nfield. For example let T be an infinite set, regarded as a space with the discrete topology. Then\nH0(T; R) = Map(T, R). But\nMap(T, R) ⊗Map(T, R) →Map(T × T, R)\nsending f ⊗g to (s, t) →f(s)g(t) is not surjective; the characteristic function of the diagonal is not\nin the image, for example (unless R = 0).\nThere are more products around. For example, there is a map\nHp(Y ) ⊗Hq(X, A) →Hp+q(Y × X, Y × A) .\nConstructing this is on your homework. Suppose Y = X. Then I get\n∪: H∗(X) ⊗H∗(X, A) →H∗(X × X, X × A) ∆∗\n--→H∗(X, A)\n\n34. CAP PRODUCT AND \"CECH\" COHOMOLOGY\nwhere ∆: (X, A) →(X × X, X × A) is the \"relative diagonal.\" This relative cup product makes\nH∗(X, A) into a module over the graded algebra H∗(X). The relative cohomology is not a ring -\nit doesn't have a unit, for example - but it is a module. And the long exact sequence of the pair is\na sequence of H∗(X)-modules.\nI want to introduce you to one more product, one that will enter into our expression of Poincare\nduality.\nThis is the cap product.\nWhat can I do with Sp(X) ⊗Sn(X)?\nWell, I can form the\ncomposite:\n∩: Sp(X) ⊗Sn(X)\n1×(α*∆∗)\n------→Sp(X) ⊗Sp(X) ⊗Sn-p(X)\n⟨-,-⟩⊗1\n-----→Sn-p(X)\nUsing our explicit formula for α, we can write:\n∩: β ⊗σ 7→β ⊗(σ *αp) ⊗(σ *ωq) 7→(β(σ *αp)) (σ *ωq)\nWe are evaluating the cochain on part of the chain, leaving a lower dimensional chain left over.\nThis composite is a chain map, and so induces a map in homology:\n∩: Hp(X) ⊗Hn(X) →Hn-p(X) .\nNotice how the dimensions work. Long ago a bad choice was made: If cohomology were graded\nwith negative integers, the way the gradations work here would look better.\nThere are also two slant products. Maybe I won't talk about them. In the next lecture, I'll\ncheck a few things about cap products, and then get into the machinery of Poincare duality.\nCap product and \"Cech\" cohomology\nWe have a few more things to say about the cap product, and will then use it to give a statement\nof Poincare duality.\nProposition 34.1. The cap product enjoys the following properties.\n(1) (a ∪b) ∩x = a ∩(b ∩x) and 1 ∩x = x: H∗(X) is a module for H∗(X).\n(2) Given a map f : X →Y , b ∈Hp(Y ), and x ∈Hn(X),\nf∗(f∗(b) ∩x) = b ∩f∗(x) .\n(3) Let ε : H∗(X) →R be the augmentation. Then\nε(b ∩x) = ⟨b, x⟩.\n(4) Cap and cup are adjoint:\n⟨a ∩b, x⟩= ⟨a, b ∩x⟩.\nProof. (1) Easy.\n(2) Let β be a cocycle representing b, and σ an n-simplex in X. Then\nf∗(f∗(β) ∩σ) = f∗((f∗(β)(σ *αp)) · (σ *ωq))\n= f∗(β(f *σ *αp) · (σ *ω))\n= β(f *σ *αp) · f∗(σ *ωq)\n= β(f *σ *αp) · (f *σ *ωq)\n= β ∩f∗(σ)\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nThis formula goes by many names: the \"projection formula,\" or \"Frobenius reciprocity.\"\n(3) We get zero unless p = n. Again let σ ∈Sinn(X), and compute:\nε(β ∩σ) = ε(β(σ) · c0\nσ(n)) = β(σ)ε(c0\nσ(n)) = β(σ) = ⟨β, σ⟩.\nHere now is a statement of Poincare duality. It deals with the homological structure of compact\ntopological manifolds.\nWe recall the notion of an orientation, and Theorem 31.9 asserting the\nexistence of a fundamental class [M] ∈Hn(M; R) in a compact R-oriented n-manifold.\nTheorem 34.2 (Poincare duality). Let M be a topological n-manifold that is compact and oriented\nwith respect to a PID R.\nThen there is a unique class [M] ∈Hn(M; R) that restricts to the\norientation class in Hn(M, M -a; R) for every a ∈M. It has the property that\n-∩[M] : Hp(M; R) →Hq(M; R) ,\np + q = n ,\nis an isomorphism for all p.\nYou might want to go back to Lecture 25 and verify that RP3 × RP3 satisfies this theorem.\nOur proof of Poincare duality will be by induction. In order to make the induction go we will\nprove a substantially more general theorem, one that involves relative homology and cohomology.\nSo we begin by understanding how the cap product behaves in relative homology.\nSuppose A ⊆X is a subspace. We have:\n\nSp(X) ⊗Sn(A)\n1⊗i∗\n\ni∗⊗1 / Sp(A) ⊗Sn(A)\n∩\n/ Sq(A)\ni∗\n\nSp(X) ⊗Sn(X)\n∩\n/\n\nSq(X)\n\nSp(X) ⊗Sn(X, A)\n\n/ Sq(X, A)\n\nThe left sequence is exact because 0 →Sn(A) →Sn(X) →Sn(X, A) →0 splits and tensoring with\nSp(X) (which is not free!) therefore leaves it exact. The solid arrow diagram commutes precisely\nby the chain-level projection formula. There is therefore a uniquely defined map on cokernels.\nThis chain map yields the relative cap product\n∩: Hp(X) ⊗Hn(X, A) →Hq(X, A)\nIt renders H∗(X, A) a module for the graded algebra H∗(X).\nI want to come back to an old question, about the significance of relative homology. Suppose\nthat K ⊆X is a subspace, and consider the relative homology H∗(X, X -K). Since the complement\nof X -K in X is K, these groups should be regarded as giving information about K. If I enlarge\n\n34. CAP PRODUCT AND \"CECH\" COHOMOLOGY\nK, I make X -K smaller: K ⊆L induces H∗(X, X -L) →H∗(X -K); the relative homology is\ncontravariant in the variable K (regarded as an object of the poset of subspaces of X).\nExcision gives insight into how H∗(X, X -K) depends on K.\nSuppose K ⊆U ⊆X with\nK ⊆Int(U). To simplify things, let's just suppose that K is closed and U is open. Then X -U is\nclosed, X -K is open, and X -U ⊆X -K, so excision asserts that the inclusion map\nH∗(U, U -K) →H∗(X, X -K)\nis an isomorphism.\nThe cap product puts some structure on H∗(X, X -K): it's a module over H∗(X). But we\ncan do better! We just decided that H∗(X, X -K) = H∗(U, U -K), so the H∗(X) action factors\nthrough an action by H∗(U), for any open set U containing K. How does this refined action change\nwhen I decrease U?\nLemma 34.3. Let K ⊆V ⊆U ⊆X, with K closed and U, V open. Then:\nHp(U) ⊗Hn(X, X -K)\ni∗⊗1\n\n∩\n*\nHq(X, X -K)\nHp(V ) ⊗Hn(X, X -K)\n∩\ncommutes.\nProof. This is just the projection formula again!\nLet UK be the set of open neighborhoods of K in X. It is partially ordered by reverse inclusion.\nThis poset is directed, since the intersection of two opens is open. By the lemma, Hp : UK →Ab\nis a directed system.\nDefinition 34.4. The Cech cohomology of K is\nˇHp(K) = lim\n-→\nU∈UK\nHp(U) .\nI apologize for this bad notation; its possible dependence on the way K is sitting in X is not\nrecorded. The maps in this directed systen are all maps of graded algebras, so the direct limit is\nnaturally a commutative graded algebra. Since tensor product commutes with direct limits, we now\nget a cap product pairing\n∩: ˇHp(K) ⊗Hn(X, X -K) →Hq(X, X -K)\nsatifying the expected properties. This is the best you can do. It's the natural structure that this\nrelative homology has: H∗(X, X -K) is a module over ˇH∗(K).\nThere are compatible restriction maps Hp(U) →Hp(K), so there is a natural map\nˇH∗(K) →H∗(K) .\nThis map is often an isomorphism. Suppose K ⊆X satisfies the following \"regular neighborhood\"\ncondition: For every open U ⊇K, there exists an open V with U ⊇V ⊇K such that K ,→V is a\nhomotopy equivalence (or actually just a homology isomorphism).\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nLemma 34.5. Under these conditions, ˇH∗(K) →H∗(K) is an isomorphism.\nProof. We will check that the map to Hp(K) satisfies the conditions we established in Lecture 23\nto be a direct limit.\nSo let x ∈Hp(K).\nLet U be a neighborood of K in X such that Hp(U) →Hp(K) is an\nisomorphism. Then indeed x is in the image of Hp(U).\nThen let U be a neighborhood of K and let x ∈Hp(U) restrict to 0 in Hp(K). Let V be a\nsub-neighborood such that Hp(V ) →Hp(K) is an isomorphism. Then x restricts to 0 in Hp(V ).\nOn the other hand, here's an example that distinguishes ˇH∗from H∗. This is a famous example.\nThe \"topologist's sine curve\" is the subspace of R2 defined as follows. It is union of three subsets,\nA, B, and C. A is the graph of sin(π/x) where 0 < x < 1. B is the interval 0 × [-1, 1]. C\nis a continuous curve from (0, -1) to (1, 0) and meeting A ∪B only at its endpoints. This is a\ncounterexample for a lot of things; you've probably seen it in 18.901.\nWhat is the singular homology of the topologist's sine curve? Use Mayer-Vietoris! I can choose\nV to be some connected portion of the continuous curve from (0, -1) to (1, 0), and U to contain\nthe rest of the space in a way that intersects V in two open intervals. Then V is contractible, and\nU is made up of two contractible connected components. (This space is not locally path connected,\nand one of these path components is not closed.)\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence looks like\n0 →H1(X) ∂-→H0(U ∩V ) →H0(U) ⊕H0(V ) →H0(X) →0 .\nThe two path components of U ∩V do not become connected in U, so ∂= 0 and we find that\nε : H∗(X)\n∼\n=\n-→H∗(∗) and hence H∗(X) ∼= H∗(∗).\nHow about ˇH∗?\nLet X ⊂U be an open neighborhood.\nThe interval 0 × [-1, 1] has an ε-\nneighborhood, for some small ε, that's contained in U. This implies that there exists a neighborhood\nX ⊆V ⊆U such that V ≃S1. This implies that\nlim\n-→\nU∈UX\nH∗(U) ∼= H∗(S1)\nby a cofinality argument that we will detail later. So ˇH∗(X) = H∗(X).\nNevertheless, under quite general conditions the Cech cohomology of a compact Hausdorffspace\nis a topological invariant. The Cech construction forms a limit over open covers of the cohomology\nof the nerve of the cover. It is a topological invariant by construction.\nTheorem 34.6. Let X be a compact subset of some Euclidean space. If there is an open neigh-\nborhood of which it is a retract, then ˇH∗(X; R) is canonically isomorphic to the cohomology defined\nusing the Cech construction, and is therefore independent of the embedding into Euclidean space.\nSee Dold's beautiful book [3] for this and other topics discussed in this chapter.\n\n35. CECH COHOMOLOGY AS A COHOMOLOGY THEORY\nCech cohomology as a cohomology theory\nLet X be any space, and let K ⊆X be a closed subspace. We've defined the Cech cohomology of\nK as the direct limit of H∗(U) as U ranges over the poset UK of open neighborhoods of K. This\noften coincides with H∗(K) but will not be the same in general. Nevertheless it behaves like a\ncohomology theory. To expand on this claim, we should begin by defining a relative version.\nSuppose L ⊆K is a pair of closed subsets of a space X. Let (U, V ) be a \"neighborhood pair\"\nfor (K, L):\nL\n⊆\nK\n⊆\n⊆\nV\n⊆\nU\nwith U and V open. These again form a directed set UK,L, with partial order given by reverse\ninclusion of pairs. Then define\nˇHp(K, L) =\nlim\n-→\n(U,V )∈UK,L\nHp(U, V ) .\nWe will want to verify versions of the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms for these functors. For a start,\nI have to explain how maps induce maps.\nLet I be a directed set and A : I →Ab a functor. If we have an order-preserving map - a\nfunctor - φ : J →I from another directed set, we get Aφ : J →Ab; so (Aφ)j = Aφ(j). I can form\ntwo direct limits: lim\n-→J Aφ and lim\n-→I A. I claim that they are related by a map\nlim\n-→\nJ\nAφ →lim\n-→\nI\nA .\nUsing the universal property of direct limits, we need to come up with compatible maps fj : Aφ(j) →\nlim\n-→I A. We have compatible maps ini : Ai →lim\n-→I A for i ∈I, so we can take fj = inφ(j).\nThese maps are compatible under composition of order-preserving maps.\nExample 35.1. A closed inclusion i : K ⊇L induces an order-preserving map φ : UK →UL. The\nfunctor Hp : UK →Ab restricts to Hp : UL →Ab, so we get maps\nlim\n-→\nUK\nHp = lim\n-→\nUK\nHpφ →lim\n-→\nUL\nHp .\ni.e.\ni∗: ˇHp(K) →ˇHp(L) .\nThis makes ˇHp into a contravariant functor on the partially ordered set of closed subsets of X.\nI can do the same thing for relative cohomology, and get the maps involved in the following two\ntheorems, whose proofs will come in due course.\nTheorem 35.2 (Long exact sequence). Let (K, L) be a closed pair in X. There is a long exact\nsequence\n· · · →ˇHp(K, L) →ˇHp(K) →ˇHp(L) δ-→ˇHp+1(K, L) →· · ·\nthat is natural in the pair.\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nTheorem 35.3 (Excision). Suppose A and B are closed subsets of a normal space, or compact\nsubsets of a Hausdorffspace. Then the map\nˇHp(A ∪B, A)\n∼\n=\n-→ˇHp(B, A ∩B)\ninduced by the inclusion is an isomorphism.\nEach of these theorems relates direct limits defined over different directed sets. To prove them, I\nwill want to rewrite the various direct limits as direct limits over the same directed set. This raises\nthe following . . .\nQuestion 35.4. When does φ : J →I induce an isomorphism lim\n-→J Aφ →lim\n-→I A?\nThis is a lot like taking a sequence and a subsequence and asking when they have the same\nlimit. There's a cofinality condition in analysis, that has a similar expression here.\nDefinition 35.5. φ : J →I is cofinal if for all i ∈I, there exists j ∈J such that i ≤φ(j).\nExample 35.6. Any surjective order-preserving map is cofinal.\nFor another example, let (N>0, <) be the positive integers with their ususal order, and (N>0, |)\nthe same set but with the divisiblity order. There is an order-preserving map φ : (N>0, <) →(N>0, |)\ngiven by n 7→n!. This map is far from surjective, but any integer n divides some factorial (n divides\nn!, for example), so φ is cofinal. We claimed that both these systems produce Q as direct limit.\nLemma 35.7. If φ : J →I is cofinal then lim\n-→J Aφ →lim\n-→I A is an isomorphism.\nProof. Check that {Aφ(j) →lim\n-→I A} satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions to be lim\n-→J Aφ.\n1. For each a ∈lim\n-→I A there exists j ∈J and aj ∈Aφ(j) such that aj 7→a: We know that there\nexists some i ∈I and ai ∈A such that ai 7→a. Pick j such that i ≤φ(j). Then ai 7→aφ(j),\nand by compatibility we get aφ(j) 7→a.\n2. Suppose a ∈Aφ(j) maps to 0 ∈lim\n-→I A. Then there is some i ∈I such that φ(j) ≤i and\na 7→0 in Ai. But then there is j′ ∈J such that i ≤φ(j′), and a 7→0 ∈Aφ(j′) as well.\nProof of Theorem 35.2, the long exact sequence. Let (K, L) be a closed pair in the space X. We\nhave\nˇHp(K, L) =\nlim\n-→\n(U,V )∈UK,L\nHp(U, V ) ,\nˇHp(K) = lim\n-→\nU∈UK\nHp(U) ,\nand\nˇHp(L) = lim\n-→\nV ∈VL\nHp(V ) .\nWe can rewrite the entire sequence as the direct limit of a directed system of exact sequences indexed\nby UK,L, since the order-preserving maps\nUK ←UK,L →UL\nU\n7→\n(U, V ) 7→V\nare both surjective and hence cofinal. So the long exact sequence of a pair in Cech cohomology is\nthe direct limit of the system of long exact sequences of the neighborhood pairs (U, V ) and so is\nexact.\n\n35. CECH COHOMOLOGY AS A COHOMOLOGY THEORY\nThe proof of the excision theorem depends upon another pair of cofinalities.\nLemma 35.8. Assume that X is a normal space and A, B closed subsets, or that X is a Hausdorff\nspace and A, B compact subsets. Then the order-preserving maps\nU(A∪B,B) ←UA × UB →U(A,A∩B)\ngiven by\n(W ∪Y, Y )\n7→\n(W, Y ) 7→(W, W ∩Y )\nare both cofinal.\nProof. The left map is surjective, because if (U, V ) ∈UA∪B,B then U ∈UA, V ∈UB, and (U, V ) =\n(U ∪V, V ).\nTo see that the right map is cofinal, start with (U, V ) ∈UA,A∩B.\nNote that A is disjoint from B ∩(X -V ), so by normality, or compactness in a Hausdorffspace,\nthere exist non-intersecting open sets S and T with A ⊆S and B ∩(X -V ) ⊆T. Then take W =\nU ∩S ∈UA and Y = V ∪T ∈UB, and observe that W ∩Y = V ∩S and so (W, W ∩Y ) ⊆(U, V ).\nProof of Theorem 35.3. Combine Lemma 35.8 with excision for singular cohomology:\nlim\n-→(W,Y )∈UA×UB Hp(W ∪Y, Y )\n∼\n=\n/\n∼\n=\n\nlim\n-→UA×UB Hp(W, W ∩Y )\n∼\n=\n\nlim\n-→(U,V )∈UA∪B,B Hp(U, V )\n/ lim\n-→(U,V )∈UA,A∩B Hp(U, V )\nˇHp(A ∪B, B)\n/ ˇHp(A, A ∩B)\nThe Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence is a consequence of these two results.\nCorollary 35.9 (Mayer-Vietoris). Suppose A and B are closed subsets of a normal space, or com-\npact subsets of a Hausdorffspace. There is a natural long exact sequence:\n· · · →ˇHp-1(A ∪B) →ˇHp-1(A) ⊕ˇHp(B) →ˇHp-1(A ∩B) →Hp(A ∪B) →· · · .\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nProof. Apply Lemma 11.6 to the ladder\n· · ·\n/ ˇHp-1(A ∪B)\n\n/ ˇHp-1(B)\n\n/ ˇHp(A ∪B, B)\n∼\n=\n\n/ ˇHp(A ∪B)\n\n/ ˇHp(B)\n\n/ · · ·\n· · ·\n/ ˇHp-1(A)\n/ ˇHp-1(A ∩B)\n/ ˇHp(A, A ∩B)\n/ ˇHp(A)\n/ ˇHp(A ∩B)\n/ · · · .\nThe fully relative cap product\nCech cohomology appeared as the natural algebra acting on H∗(X, X -K), where K is a closed\nsubspace of X:\n∩: ˇHp(K) ⊗Hn(X, X -K) →Hq(X, X -K) ,\np + q = n .\nIf we fix xK ∈Hn(X, X -K), then capping with xK gives a map\n∩xK : ˇHp(K) →Hq(X, X -K) ,\np + q = n .\nWe will be very interested in showing that this map is an isomorphism under certain conditions.\nThis is a kind of duality result, comparing cohomology and relative homology and reversing the\ndimensions. We'll try to show that such a map is an isomorphism by embedding it in a map of long\nexact sequences and using the five-lemma.\nFor a start, let's think about how these maps vary as we change K. So let L be a closed subset\nof K, so X -K ⊆X -L and we get a \"restriction map\"\ni∗: Hn(X, X -K) →Hn(X, X -L) .\nDefine xL as the image of xK. The diagram\nˇHp(K)\n/\n-∩xK\n\nˇHp(L)\n-∩xL\n\nHq(X, X -K)\n/ Hq(X, X -L)\ncommutes by the projection formula. This embeds into a ladder shown in the theorem below. We\nwill accompany this ladder with a second one, to complete the picture.\nTheorem 36.1. Let L ⊆K be closed subspaces of a space X. There is a \"fully relative\" cap product\n∩: ˇHp(K, L) ⊗Hn(X, X -K) →Hq(X -L, X -K) ,\np + q = n ,\nsuch that for any xK ∈Hn(X, X -K) the ladder\n· · ·\n/ ˇHp(K, L)\n/\n∩xK\n\nˇHp(K)\n/\n∩xK\n\nˇHp(L)\nδ\n/\n∩xL\n\nˇHp+1(K, L)\n/\n∩xK\n\n· · ·\n· · ·\n/ Hq(X -L, X -K)\n/ Hq(X, X -K)\n/ Hq(X, X -L)\n∂/ Hq-1(X -L, X -K)\n/ · · ·\n\n36. THE FULLY RELATIVE CAP PRODUCT\ncommutes, where xL is the restriction of xK to Hn(X, X -L), and for any x ∈Hn(X)\n· · ·\n/ ˇHp(X, K)\n∩x\n\n/ ˇHp(X, L)\n∩x\n\n/ ˇHp(K, L)\n∩xK\n\nδ\n/ ˇHp+1(X, K)\n∩x\n\n/ · · ·\n· · ·\n/ Hq(X -K)\n/ Hq(X -L)\n/ Hq(X -L, X -K) ∂\n/ Hq-1(X -K)\n/ · · ·\ncommutes, where xK is the restriction of x to Hn(X, X -K).\nProof. What I have to do is define a cap product along the bottom row of the diagram (with\np + q = n)\nˇHp(K) ⊗Hn(X, X -K)\n∩\n/ Hq(X, X -K)\nˇHp(K, L) ⊗Hn(X, X -K)\nO\n∩\n/ Hq(X -L, X -K)\nO\nThis requires going back to the origin of the cap product. Our map ˇHp(K) ⊗Hn(X, X -K) →\nHq(X, X -K) came (via excision) from a chain map Sp(U) ⊗Sn(U, U -K) →Sq(U, U -K) where\nU ⊇K, defined by β ⊗σ 7→β(σ *αp) · (σ *ωq). Now given inclusions\nL\n⊆\nK\n⊆\n⊆\nV\n⊆\nU\nwe can certainly fill in the bottom row of the diagram\nSp(U) ⊗Sn(U)/Sn(U -K)\n/ Sq(U)/Sq(U -K)\nSp(U, V ) ⊗Sn(U)/Sn(U -K)\n/\nO\nSq(U -L)/Sq(U -K)\nO\nSince cochains in Sp(U, V ) kill chains in V , we can extend the bottom row to\nSp(U) ⊗Sn(U, U -K)\n/ Sq(U, U -K)\nSp(U, V ) ⊗(Sn(U -L) + Sn(V ))/Sn(U -K)\n/\n≃\n\nO\nSq(U -L)/Sq(U -K)\nO\nSp(U, V ) ⊗Sn(U)/Sn(U -K)\nBut L ⊆V , so (U -L)∪V = U, and the locality principle then guarantees that Sn(U -L)+Sn(V ) →\nSn(U) is a quasi-isomorphism. By excision, Hn(U, U -K) →Hn(X, X -K) is an isomorphism.\nNow use our standard map μ : H∗(C) ⊗H∗(D) →H∗(C ⊗D).\nThis gives the construction of the fully relative cap product. We leave the checks of commuta-\ntivity to the listener.\nThe diagram\nˇHp(L)\nδ\n/\n-∩xL\n\nˇHp+1(K, L)\n-∩xK\n\nHq(X, X -L)\n∂\n/ Hq-1(X -L, X -K)\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nprovides us with the memorable formula\n(δb) ∩xK = ∂(b ∩xL) .\nThe construction of the Mayer-Vietoris sequences now gives:\nTheorem 36.2. Let A, B be closed in a normal space or compact in a Hausdorffspace.\nThe\nCech cohomology and singular homology Mayer-Vietoris sequences are compatible: for any xA∪B ∈\nHn(X, X -A ∪B), there is a commutative ladder (where again we use the notation Hq(X|A) =\nHq(X, X -A), and again p + q = n)\n· · ·\n/ ˇHp(A ∪B)\n/\n∩xA∪B\n\nˇHp(A) ⊕ˇHp(B)\n/\n(∩xA)⊕(∩xB)\n\nˇHp(A ∩B)\n/\n∩xA∩B\n\nˇHp+1(A ∪B)\n/\n∩xA∪B\n\n· · ·\n· · ·\n/ Hq(X|A ∪B)\n/ Hq(X|A) ⊕Hq(X|B)\n/ Hq(X|A ∩B)\n/ Hq-1(X|A ∪B)\n/ · · ·\nin which the homology classes xA, xB, xA∩B are restrictions of the class xA∪B in the diagram\nHn(X, X -A)\n)\nHn(X, X -A ∪B)\n)\nHn(X, X -A ∩B)\nHn(X, X -B)\nPoincare duality\nLet M be a n-manifold and K a compact subset. By Theorem 32.1\nHn(M, M -K; R)\n∼\n=\n-→Γ(K; oM ⊗R) .\nAn orientation along K is a section of oM ⊗R over K that restricts to a generator of Hn(M, M-x; R)\nfor every x ∈K. The corresponding class in Hn(M, M -K; R) is a fundamental class along K,\n[M]K. We recall also the fully relative cap product pairing (in which p + q = n and L is a closed\nsubset of K)\n∩: ˇHp(K, L; R) ⊗R Hn(M, M -K; R) →Hq(M -L, M -K; R) .\nWe now combine all of this in the following climactic result.\nTheorem 37.1 (Fully relative Poincare duality). Let M be an n-manifold and K ⊇L a pair of\ncompact subsets. Assume given an R-orientation along K, with corresponding fundamental class\n[M]K. With p + q = n, the map\n∩[M]K : ˇHp(K, L; R) →Hq(M -L, M -K; R) .\nis an isomorphism.\n\n37. POINCARE DUALITY\nWe have seen that these isomorphisms are compatible; they form the rungs of the commuting\nladder\n· · ·\n/ ˇHp-1(L)\n/\n∩[M]L\n\nˇHp(K, L)\n/\n∩[M]K\n\nˇHp(K)\n/\n∩[M]K\n\nˇHp(L)\n/\n∩[M]L\n\n· · ·\n· · ·\n/ Hq+1(M, M -L)\n/ Hq(M -L, M -K)\n/ Hq(M, M -K)\n/ Hq(M, M -L)\n/ · · ·\nAlso, if M is compact and R-oriented with fundamental class [M] restricting along K to [M]K, we\nhave the ladder of isomorphisms\n· · ·\n/ ˇHp(M, L)\n/\n∩[M]\n\nˇHp(K, L)\n/\n∩[M]K\n\nˇHp+1(M, K)\n/\n∩[M]\n\nˇHp+1(M, L)\n/\n∩[M]\n\n· · ·\n· · ·\n/ Hq(M -L)\n/ Hq(M -L, M -K)\n/ Hq-1(M -K)\n/ Hq-1(M -L)\n/ · · ·\nTo prove this theorem, we will follow the same five-step process we used to prove the Orientation\nTheorem 32.1. We have already prepared the Mayer-Vietoris ladder for this purpose. We will also\nneed:\nLemma 37.2. Let A1 ⊇A2 ⊇· · · be a decreasing sequence of compact subspaces of M. Then\nˇHp(Ak) →ˇHp(A)\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. This follows from the observation that a direct limit of direct limits is a direct limit.\nProof of Theorem 37.1. By the top ladder and the five-lemma, we may assume L = ∅; so we want\nto prove that\n∩[M]K : ˇHp(K; R) →Hq(M, M -K; R)\nis an isomorphism.\n(1) M = Rn, K a compact convex set. We claim that\nˇH∗(K)\n∼\n=\n-→H∗(K) .\nFor any ε > 0, let Uε denote the ε-neighborhood of K,\nUε =\n[\nx∈K\nBε(x) .\nFor any y ∈Uε there is a closest point in K, since the distance function to y is continuous and\nbounded below on the compact set K and so achieves its infimum. If x′, x′′ ∈K are the same\ndistance from y, then the midpoint of the segment joining x′ and x′′ is closer, but lies in K since\nK is convex. So there is a unique closest point, f(y). We let the listener check that f : Uε →K is\ncontinuous. It is also clear that if i : K →Uε is the inclusion then i *f is homotopic to the identity\non Y , by an affine homotopy.\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nNow let Dn be a disk centered at the origin and containing the compact set K, and consider\nthe commutative diagram\nHp(K)\n∩[Rn]K\n/ Hq(Rn, Rn -K)\nHp(Dn)\n∼\n=\nO\n/\n∼\n=\n\nHq(Rn, Rn -Dn)\n∼\n=\nO\n∼\n=\n\nHp(∗)\n/ Hq(Rn, Rn -∗) .\nThe groups are zero unless p = 0, q = n. By naturality of the cap product, the bottom map is given\nby 1 7→1 ∩[Rn]∗, and this is [Rn]∗since capping with 1 is the identity, and this fundamental class\nis a generator of Hn(Rn, Rn -∗).\n(2) K a finite union of compact convex subsets of Rn. This follows by induction and the five\nlemma applied to the Mayer-Vietoris ladder 36.2.\n(3) K is any compact subset of Rn. This follows as before by a limit argument, using Lemmas\n32.4 and 37.2.\n(4) M arbitrary, K is a finite union of compact Euclidean subsets of M. This follows from (3)\nand Theorem 36.2.\n(5) M arbitrary, K an arbitrary compact subset. This follows just as in the proof of Theorem\n32.1.\nLet's point out some special cases. With K = M, we get:\nCorollary 37.3. Suppose that M is a compact R-oriented n-manifold, and let L be a closed subset.\nThen (with p + q = n) we have the commuting ladder whose rungs are isomorphisms:\n· · ·\n/ ˇHp-1(L)\n∩[M]L\n\n/ ˇHp(M, L)\n∩[M]\n\n/ Hp(M)\n∩[M]\n\n/ ˇHp(L)\n∩[M]L\n\n/ · · ·\n· · ·\n/ Hq+1(M, M -L)\n/ Hq(M -L)\n/ Hq(M)\n/ Hq(M, M -L)\n/ · · ·\nWith L = ∅, we get:\nCorollary 37.4. Suppose that M is an n-manifold, and let K be a compact subset. An R-orientation\nalong K determines (with p + q = n) an isomorphism\n∩[M]K : ˇHp(K; R) →Hq(M, M -K; R) .\nThe intersection of these two special cases is:\nCorollary 37.5 (Poincare duality). Let M be a compact R-oriented n-manifold. Then\n∩[M] : Hp(M; R) →Hn-p(M; R)\nis an isomorphism.\n\n38. APPLICATIONS\nApplications\nToday we harvest consequences of Poincare duality. We'll use the form\nTheorem 38.1. Let M be an n-manifold and K a compact subset. An R-orientation along K\ndetermines a fundamental class [M]K ∈Hn(M, M -K), and capping gives an isomorphism:\n∩[M]K : ˇHn-q(K; R)\n∼\n=\n-→Hq(M, M -K; R) .\nCorollary 38.2. ˇHp(K; R) = 0 for p > n.\nWe can contrast this with singular (co)homology. Here's an example:\nExample 38.3 (Barratt-Milnor, [1]). A two-dimensional version K of the Hawaiian earring, i.e.,\nnested spheres all tangent to a point whose radii are going to zero.\nWhat they proved is that\nHq(K; Q) is uncountable for every q > 1. But Cech cohomology is much more well-behaved.\nTheorem 38.4 (Alexander duality). For any compact subset K of Rn, the composite\nˇHn-q(K; R)\n∩[Rn]K\n-----→Hq(Rn, Rn -K; R) ∂-→eHq-1(Rn -K; R)\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. eH∗(Rn; R) = 0.\nThis is extremely useful! For example\nCorollary 38.5. If K is a compact subset of Rn then ˇHn(K; R) = 0.\nCorollary 38.6. The complement of a knot in S3 is a homology circle.\nExample 38.7. Take the case q = 1:\nˇHn-1(K; R)\n∼\n=\n-→eH0(Rn -K; R) = ker(ε : Rπ0(Rn -K) →R) .\nThe augmentation is a split surjection, so this is a free R-module. This shows, for example, that\nRP2 can't be embedded in R3 - at least not with a regular neighborhood.\nIf we take n = 2 and suppose that ˇH∗(K) = H∗(S1), we find that the complement of K has two\npath components. This is the Jordan Curve Theorem.\nThere is a useful purely cohomological consequence of Poincare duality, obtained by combining\nit with the universal coeffient theorem\n0 →Ext1\nZ(Hq-1(X), Z) →Hq(X) →Hom(Hq(X), Z) →0 .\nFirst, note that Hom(Hq(X), Z) is always torsion-free. If I assume that Hq-1(X) is finitely gen-\nerated, then Ext1\nZ(Hq-1(X), Z) is a finite abelian group. So the UCT is providing the short exact\nsequence\n0 →torsHq(X) →Hq(X) →Hq(X)/tors →0\n- that is,\nHq(X)/tors\n∼\n=\n-→Hom(Hq(X)/tors, Z) .\n\nCHAPTER 3. COHOMOLOGY AND DUALITY\nThat is to say, the Kronecker pairing descends to a perfect pairing\nHq(X)\ntors\n⊗Hq(X)\ntors\n→Z .\nLet's combine this with Poincare duality. Let X = M be a compact oriented n-manifold, so\nthat\n∩[M] : Hn-q(M)\n∼\n=\n-→Hq(M) .\nWe get a perfect pairing\nHq(X)\ntors\n⊗Hn-q(X)\ntors\n→Z .\nAnd what is that pairing? It's given by the composite\nHq(M) ⊗Hn-q(M)\n/\n1⊗(-∩[M])\n\nZ\nHq(M) ⊗Hq(M)\n⟨-,-⟩\nand we've seen that\n⟨a, b ∩[M]⟩= ⟨a ∪b, [M]⟩\nWe have used R = Z, but the same argument works for any PID - in particular for any field, in\nwhich case torsV = 0. We have proven:\nTheorem 38.8. Let R be a PID an M a compact R-oriented n-manifold. Then\na ⊗b 7→⟨a ∪b, [M]⟩\ninduces a perfect pairing (with p + q = n)\nHp(M; R)\ntors\n⊗R\nHq(M; R)\ntors\n→R .\nExample 38.9. Complex projective 2-space is a compact 4-manifold, orientable since it is simply\nconnected. It has a cell structure with cells in dimensions 0, 2, and 4, so its homology is Z in those\ndimensions and 0 elsewhere, and so the same is true of its cohomology. Up till now the cup product\nstructure has been a mystery. But now we know that\nH2(CP2) ⊗H2(CP2) →H4(CP2)\nis a perfect pairing. So if we write a for a generator of H2(CP2), then a ∪a = a2 is a free generator\nfor H4(CP2). We have discovered that\nH∗(CP2) = Z[a]/a3 .\nBy the way, notice that if we had chosen -a as a generator, we would still produce the same\ngenerator for H4(CP2): so there is a preferred orientation, the one whose fundamental class pairs\nto 1 against a2.\nThis calculation shows that while CP2 and S2 ∨S4 are both simply connected and have the\nsame homology, they are not homotopy equivalent. This implies that the attaching map S3 →S2\nfor the top cell in CP2 - the Hopf map - is essential.\nHow about CP3?\nIt just adds a 6-cell, so now H6(CP3) ∼= Z.\nThe pairing H2(CP3) ⊗\nH4(CP3) →H6(CP3) is perfect, so we find that a3 generates H6(CP3). Continuing in this way,\nwe have\nH∗(CPn) = Z[a]/(an+1) .\n\n38. APPLICATIONS\nExample 38.10. Exactly the same argument shows that\nH∗(RPn; F2) = F2[a]/(an+1)\nwhere |a| = 1.\nI'll end with the following application.\nTheorem 38.11 (Borsuk-Ulam). Think of Sn as the unit vectors in Rn+1. For any continuous\nfunction f : Sn →Rn, there exists x ∈Sn such that f(x) = f(-x).\nProof. Suppose that no such x exists. Then we may define a continuous function g : Sn →Sn-1 by\ng : x 7→\nf(x) -f(-x)\n||f(x) -f(-x)|| .\nNote that g(-x) = -g(x): g is equivariant with respect to the antipodal action. It descends to a\nmap g : RPn →RPn-1.\nWe claim that g∗: H1(RPn) →H1(RPn-1) is nontrivial. To see this, pick a basepoint b ∈Sn\nand choose a 1-simplex σ : ∆1 →Sn such that σ(e0) = b and σ(e1) = -b. The group H1(RPn) is\ngenerated by the cycle pσ. The image of this cycle in H1(RPn-1) is represented by the loop gpσ\nat b = pb, which is the image of the 1-simplex gσ joining gb to g(-b) = -g(b). The class of this\n1-simplex thus generates H1(RPn-1).\nTherefore g is nontrivial in H1(-; F2), and hence also in H1(-; F2). Writing an for the generator\nof H1(RPn; F2), we must have an = g∗an-1, and consequently an\nn = (g∗an-1)n = g∗(an\nn-1). But\nHn(RPn-1; F2) = 0, so an\nn-1 = 0; while an\nn = 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nBibliography\n[1] M. G. Barratt and J. Milnor, An example of anomalous singular homology, Proc. Amer. Math.\nSoc. 13 (1962) 293-297.\n[2] G.

      "content": "Chapter 1\nSingular homology\nIntroduction: singular simplices and chains\nThis is a course on algebraic topology. We'll discuss the following topics.\n1. Singular homology\n2. CW-complexes\n3. Basics of category theory\n4. Homological algebra\n5. The Kunneth theorem\n6. Cohomology\n7. Universal coefficient theorems\n8. Cup and cap products\n9. Poincare duality.\nThe objects of study are of course topological spaces, and the machinery we develop in this course\nis designed to be applicable to a general space. But we are really mainly interested in geometrically\nimportant spaces. Here are some examples.\n- The most basic example is n-dimensional Euclidean space, Rn.\n- The n-sphere Sn = {x ∈Rn+1 : |x| = 1}, topologized as a subspace of Rn+1.\n- Identifying antipodal points in Sn gives real projective space RPn = Sn/(x ∼-x), i.e. the\nspace of lines through the origin in Rn+1.\n- Call an ordered collection of k orthonormal vectors an orthonormal k-frame. The space of\northonormal k-frames in Rn forms the Stiefel manifold Vk(Rn), topologized as a subspace of\n(Sn-1)k.\n- The Grassmannian Grk(Rn) is the space of k-dimensional linear subspaces of Rn. Forming\nthe span gives us a surjection Vk(Rn) →Grk(Rn), and the Grassmannian is given the quotient\ntopology. For example, Gr1(Rn) = RPn-1.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nAll these examples are manifolds; that is, they are Hausdorffspaces locally homeomorphic to Eu-\nclidean space. Aside from Rn itself, the preceding examples are also compact. Such spaces exhibit\na hidden symmetry, which is the culmination of 18.905: Poincare duality.\nAs the name suggests, the central aim of algebraic topology is the usage of algebraic tools to\nstudy topological spaces. A common technique is to probe topological spaces via maps to them\nfrom simpler spaces. In different ways, this approach gives rise to singular homology and homotopy\ngroups. We now detail the former; the latter takes the stage in 18.906.\nDefinition 1.1. For n ≥0, the standard n-simplex ∆n is the convex hull of the standard basis\n{e0, . . . , en} in Rn+1:\n∆n =\nnX\ntiei :\nX\nti = 1, ti ≥0\no\n⊆Rn+1.\nThe ti are called barycentric coordinates.\nThe standard simplices are related by face inclusions di : ∆n-1 →∆n for 0 ≤i ≤n, where di is\nthe affine map that sends verticies to vertices, in order, and omits the vertex ei.\nDefinition 1.2. Let X be any topological space. A singular n-simplex in X is a continuous map\nσ : ∆n →X. Denote by Sinn(X) the set of all n-simplices in X.\nThis seems like a rather bold construction to make, as Sinn(X) is huge. But be patient!\nFor 0 ≤i ≤n, precomposition by the face inclusion di produces a map di : Sinn(X) →Sinn-1(X)\nsending σ 7→σ *di. This is the \"ith face\" of σ. This allows us to make sense of the \"boundary\" of\na simplex, and we are particularly interested in simplices for which that boundary vanishes.\nFor example, if σ is a 1-simplex that forms a closed loop, then d1σ = d0σ. To express the\ncondition that the boundary vanishes, we would like to write d0σ -d1σ = 0 - but this difference is\nno longer a simplex. To accommodate such formal sums, we will enlarge Sinn(X) further by forming\nthe free abelian group it generates.\nDefinition 1.3. The abelian group Sn(X) of singular n-chains in X is the free abelian group\ngenerated by n-simplices\nSn(X) = ZSinn(X).\nSo an n-chain is a finite linear combination of simplices,\nk\nX\ni=1\naiσi ,\nai ∈Z ,\nσi ∈Sinn(X) .\nIf n < 0, Sinn(X) is declared to be empty, so Sn(X) = 0.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION: SINGULAR SIMPLICES AND CHAINS\nWe can now define the boundary operator\nd: Sinn(X) →Sn-1(X),\nby\ndσ =\nn\nX\ni=0\n(-1)idiσ.\nThis extends to a homomorphism d: Sn(X) →Sn-1(X) by additivity.\nWe use this homomorphism to obtain something more tractable than the entirety of Sn(X).\nFirst we restrict our attention to chains with vanishing boundary.\nDefinition 1.4. An n-cycle in X is an n-chain c with dc = 0. Notation:\nZn(X) = ker(d : Sn(X) →Sn-1(X)) .\nFor example, if σ is a 1-simplex forming a closed loop, then σ ∈Z1(X) since dσ = d0σ-d1σ = 0.\nIt turns out that there's a cheap way to produce a cycle:\nTheorem 1.5. Any boundary is a cycle; that is, d2 = 0.\nWe'll leave the verification of this important result as a homework problem. What we have\nfound, then, is that the singular chains form a \"chain complex,\" as in the following definition.\nDefinition 1.6. A graded abelian group is a sequence of abelian groups, indexed by the integers. A\nchain complex is a graded abelian group {An} together with homomorphisms d : An →An-1 with\nthe property that d2 = 0.\nThe group of n-dimensional boundaries is\nBn(X) = im(d : Sn+1(X) →Sn(X)) ,\nand the theorem tells us that this is a subgroup of the group of cycles: the \"cheap\" ones. If we\nquotient by them, what's left is the \"interesting cycles,\" captured in the following definition.\nDefinition 1.7. The nth singular homology group of X is:\nHn(X) = Zn(X)\nBn(X) = ker(d : Sn(X) →Sn-1(X))\nim(d : Sn+1(X) →Sn(X)) .\nWe use the same language for any chain complex: it has cycles, boundaries, and homology\ngroups. The homology forms a graded abelian group.\nBoth Zn(X) and Bn(X) are free abelian groups because they are subgroups of the free abelian\ngroup Sn(X), but the quotient Hn(X) isn't necessarily free. While Zn(X) and Bn(X) are uncount-\nably generated, Hn(X) turns out to be finitely generated for the spaces we are interested in. If T is\nthe torus, for example, then we will see that H1(T) ∼= Z ⊕Z, with generators given by the 1-cycles\nillustrated below.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nWe will learn to compute the homology groups of a wide variety of spaces. The n-sphere for\nexample has the following homology groups:\nHq(Sn) =\n\nZ\nif\nq = n > 0\nZ\nif\nq = 0, n > 0\nZ ⊕Z\nif\nq = n = 0\notherwise .\n\n/\n\n/\nO\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.905 Algebraic Topology I\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "CHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nHomology\nIn the last lecture we introduced the standard n-simplex ∆n ⊆Rn+1. Singular simplices in a space\nX are maps σ: ∆n →X and constitute the set Sinn(X). For example, Sin0(X) consists of points\nof X. We also described the face inclusions di : ∆n-1 →∆n, and the induced \"face maps\"\ndi : Sinn(X) →Sinn-1(X) , 0 ≤i ≤n ,\ngiven by precomposing with face inclusions: diσ = σ *di. For homework you established some\nquadratic relations satisfied by these maps. A collection of sets Kn, n ≥0, together with maps\ndi : Kn →Kn-1 related to each other in this way, is a semi-simplicial set. So we have assigned to\nany space X a semi-simplicial set S∗(X).\nTo the semi-simplicial set {Sinn(X), di} we then applied the free abelian group functor, obtaining\na semi-simplicial abelian group. Using the dis, we constructed a boundary map d which makes S∗(X)\na chain complex - that is, d2 = 0. We capture this process in a diagram:\n{spaces}\nSin∗\n\nH∗\n/ {graded abelian groups}\n{semi-simplicial sets}\nZ(-)\n\n{semi-simplicial abelian groups}\n/ {chain complexes}\ntake homology\nO\nExample 2.1. Suppose we have σ: ∆1 →X. Define φ: ∆1 →∆1 by sending (t, 1 -t) to (1 -t, t).\nPrecomposing σ with φ gives another singular simplex σ which reverses the orientation of σ. It is\nnot true that σ = -σ in S1(X).\nHowever, we claim that σ ≡-σ mod B1(X). This means that there is a 2-chain in X whose\nboundary is σ + σ. If d0σ = d1σ, so that σ ∈Z1(X), then σ and -σ are homologous: [σ] = -[σ] in\nH1(X).\nTo construct an appropriate boundary, consider the projection map π : ∆2 →∆1 that is the\naffine extension of the map sending e0 and e2 to e0 and e1 to e1.\n\n2. HOMOLOGY\nWe'll compute d(σ *π). Some of the terms will be constant singular simplices. Let's write\ncn\nx : ∆n →X for the constant map with value x ∈X. Then\nd(σ *π) = σπd0 -σπd1 + σπd2 = σ -c1\nσ(0) + σ .\nThe constant simplex c1\nσ(0) is an \"error term,\" and we wish to eliminate it. To achieve this we can\nuse the constant 2-simplex c2\nσ(0) at σ(0); its boundary is\nc1\nσ(0) -c1\nσ(0) + c1\nσ(0) = c1\nσ(0) .\nSo\nσ + σ = d(σ *π + c2\nσ(0)) ,\nand σ ≡-σ mod B1(X) as claimed.\nSome more language: two cycles that differ by a boundary dc are said to be homologous, and\nthe chain c is a homology between them.\nLet's compute the homology of the very simplest spaces, ∅and ∗. For the first, Sinn(∅) = ∅,\nso S∗(∅) = 0. Hence · · · →S2 →S1 →S0 is the zero chain complex. This means that Z∗(∅) =\nB∗(∅) = 0. The homology in all dimensions is therefore 0.\nFor ∗, we have Sinn(∗) = {cn\n∗} for all n ≥0. Consequently Sn(∗) = Z for n ≥0 and 0 for n < 0.\nFor each i, dicn\n∗= cn-1\n∗\n, so the boundary maps d: Sn(∗) →Sn-1(∗) in the chain complex depend\non the parity of n as follows:\nd(cn\n∗) =\nn\nX\ni=0\n(-1)icn-1\n∗\n=\n(\ncn-1\n∗\nfor n even, and\nfor n odd.\nThis means that our chain complex is:\n0 ←Z\n0←-Z\n1←-Z\n0←-Z\n1←-· · · .\nThe boundaries coincide with the cycles except in dimension zero, where B0(∗) = 0 while Z0(∗) = Z.\nTherefore H0(∗) = Z and Hi(∗) = 0 for i = 0.\nWe've defined homology groups for each space, but haven't yet considered what happens to\nmaps between spaces. A continuous map f : X →Y induces a map f∗: Sinn(X) →Sinn(Y ) by\ncomposition:\nf∗: σ 7→f *σ .\nFor f∗to be a map of semi-simplicial sets, it needs to commute with face maps: We need f∗*di =\ndi *f∗. A diagram is said to be commutative if all composites with the same source and target are\nequal, so this equation is equivalent to commutativity of the diagram\nSinn(X)\nf∗\n/\ndi\n\nSinn(Y )\ndi\n\nSinn-1(X)\nf∗/ Sinn-1(Y ) .\nWell, dif∗σ = (f∗σ) *di = f *σ *di, and f∗(diσ) = f∗(σ *di) = f *σ *di as well. The diagram\nremains commutative when we pass to the free abelian groups of chains.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nIf C∗and D∗are chain complexes, a chain map f : C∗→D∗is a collection of maps fn : Cn →Dn\nsuch that the following diagram commutes for every n:\nCn\nfn\n/\ndC\n\nDn\ndD\n\nCn-1\nfn-1 / Dn-1\nFor example, if f : X →Y is a continuous map, then f∗: S∗(X) →S∗(Y ) is a chain map as discussed\nabove.\nA chain map induces a map in homology f∗: Hn(C) →Hn(D). The method of proof is a so-\ncalled \"diagram chase\" and it will be the first of many. We check that we get a map Zn(C) →Zn(D).\nLet c ∈Zn(C), so that dCc = 0. Then dDfn(c) = fn-1dCc = fn-1(0) = 0, because f is a chain\nmap. This means that fn(c) is also an n-cycle, i.e., f gives a map Zn(C) →Zn(D).\nSimilarly, we get a map Bn(C) →Bn(D). Let c ∈Bn(C), so that there exists c′ ∈Cn+1 such\nthat dCc′ = c. Then fn(c) = fndCc′ = dDfn+1(c′). Thus fn(c) is the boundary of fn+1(c′), and f\ngives a map Bn(C) →Bn(D).\nThe two maps Zn(C) →Zn(D) and Bn(C) →Bn(D) quotient to give a map on homology\nf∗: Hn(X) →Hn(Y ).\nCategories, functors, natural transformations\nFrom spaces and continuous maps, we constructed graded abelian groups and homomorphisms. We\nnow cast this construction in the more general language of category theory.\nOur discussion of category theory will be interspersed throughout the text, introducing new\nconcepts as they are needed. Here we begin by introducing the basic definitions.\nDefinition 3.1.

We\nnow cast this construction in the more general language of category theory.\nOur discussion of category theory will be interspersed throughout the text, introducing new\nconcepts as they are needed. Here we begin by introducing the basic definitions.\nDefinition 3.1. A category C consists of the following data.\n- a class ob(C) of objects;\n- for every pair of objects X and Y , a set of morphisms C(X, Y );\n- for every object X an identity morphism 1X ∈C(X, X); and\n- for every triple of objects X, Y, Z, a composition map C(X, Y ) × C(Y, Z) →C(X, Z), written\n(f, g) 7→g *f.\nThese data are required to satisfy the following:\n- 1Y *f = f, and f *1X = f.\n- Composition is associative: (h *g) *f = h *(g *f).\nNote that we allow the collection of objects to be a class. This enables us to talk about a\n\"category of all sets\" for example. But we require each C(X, Y ) to be set, and not merely a class.\nSome interesting categories have a set of objects; they are called small categories.\nWe will often write X ∈C to mean X ∈ob(C), and f : X →Y to mean f ∈C(X, Y ).\n\n3. CATEGORIES, FUNCTORS, NATURAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nDefinition 3.2. If X, Y ∈C, then f : X →Y is an isomorphism if there exists g: Y →X with\nf *g = 1Y and g *f = 1X. We may write\nf : X\n∼\n=\n-→Y\nto indicate that f is an isomorphism.\nExample 3.3. Many common mathematical structures can be arranged in categories.\n- Sets and functions between them form a category Set.\n- Abelian groups and homomorphisms form a category Ab.\n- Topological spaces and continuous maps form a category Top.\n- Chain complexes and chain maps form a category chAb.\n- A monoid is the same as a category with one object, where the elements of the monoid are\nthe morphisms in the category. It's a small category.\n- The sets [n] = {0, . . . , n} for n ≥0 together with weakly order-preserving maps between\nthem form the simplex category ∆, another small category. It contains as a subcategory the\nsemi-simplex category ∆inj with the same objects but only injective weakly order-preserving\nmaps.\n- A partially ordered set or \"poset\" forms a category in which there is a morphism from x to y\niffx ≤y. A small category is a poset exactly when (1) there is at most one morphism between\nany two objects, and (2) the only isomorphisms are identities. This is to be distinguished\nfrom the category of posets and order-preserving maps between them, which is \"large.\"\nCategories may be related to each other by rules describing effect on both objects and morphisms.\nDefinition 3.4. Let C, D be categories. A functor F : C →D consists of the data of\n- an assignment F : ob(C) →ob(D), and\n- for all X, Y ∈ob(C), a function F : C(X, Y ) →D(F(X), F(Y )) .\nThese data are required to satisfy the following two properties:\n- For all X ∈ob(C), F(1X) = 1F(X) ∈D(F(X), F(X)), and\n- For all composable pairs of morphisms f, g in C, F(g *f) = F(g) *F(f).\nWe have defined quite a few functors already:\nSinn : Top →Set ,\nSn : Top →Ab ,\nHn : Top →Ab ,\nfor example. We also have defined, for each X, a morphism d : Sn(X) →Sn-1(X). This is a\n\"morphism between functors.\" This property is captured by another definition.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nDefinition 3.5. Let F, G: C →D be two functors.\nA natural transformation or natural map\nθ: F →G consists of maps θX : F(X) →G(X) for all X ∈ob(C) such that for all f : X →Y the\nfollowing diagram commutes.\nF(X)\nF(f)\n\nθX / G(X)\nG(f)\n\nF(Y )\nθY\n/ G(Y )\nSo for example the boundary map d: Sn →Sn-1 is a natural transformation.\nExample 3.6. Suppose that C and D are two categories, and assume that C is small. We may then\nform the category of functors Fun(C, D). Its objects are the functors from C to D, and given two\nfunctors F, G, Fun(C, D)(F, G) is the set of natural transformations from F to G. We let the reader\ndefine the rest of the structure of this category, and check the axioms. We needed to assume that C\nis small in order to guarantee that there is no more than a set of natural transformations between\nfunctors.\nFor example, let G be a group (or a monoid) viewed as a one-object category.\nAn object\nF ∈Fun(G, Ab) is simply a group action of G on F(∗) = A, i.e., a representation of G in abelian\ngroups. Given another F ′ ∈Fun(G, Ab) with F ′(∗) = A′, a natural transformation from F →F ′\nis precisely a G-equivariant homomorphism A →A′.\nCategorical language\nLet Vectk be the category of vector spaces over a field k, and linear transformations between them.\nGiven a vector space V , you can consider the dual V ∗= Hom(V, k). Does this give us a functor? If\nyou have a linear transformation f : V →W, you get a map f∗: W ∗→V ∗, so this is like a functor,\nbut the induced map goes the wrong way. This operation does preserve composition and identities,\nin an appropriate sense. This is an example of a contravariant functor.\nI'll leave it to you to spell out the definition, but notice that there is a univeral example of\na contravariant functor out of a category C: C →Cop, where Cop has the same objects as C, but\nCop(X, Y ) is declared to be the set C(Y, X). The identity morphisms remain the same. To describe\nthe composition in Cop, I'll write fop for f ∈C(Y, X) regarded as an element of Cop(X, Y ); then\nfop *gop = (g *f)op.\nThen a contravariant functor from C to D is the same thing as a (\"covariant\") functor from Cop\nto D.\nLet C be a category, and let Y ∈ob(C). We get a map Cop →Set that takes X 7→C(X, Y ), and\ntakes a map X →W to the map defined by composition C(W, Y ) →C(X, Y ). This is called the\nfunctor represented by Y . It is very important to note that C(-, Y ) is contravariant, while, on the\nother hand, for any fixed X, C(X, -) is a covariant functor (and is said to be \"corepresentable\" by\nX).\nExample 4.1. Recall that the simplex category ∆has objects the totally ordered sets [n] =\n{0, 1, . . . , n}, with order preserving maps as morphisms. The \"standard simplex\" gives us a functor\n∆: ∆→Top. Now fix a space X, and consider\n[n] 7→Top(∆n, X) .\nThis gives us a contravariant functor ∆→Set, or a covariant functor ∆op →Set. This functor\ncarries in it all the face and degeneracy maps we discussed earlier, and their compositions. Let us\nmake a definition.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.905 Algebraic Topology I\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

We needed to assume that C\nis small in order to guarantee that there is no more than a set of natural transformations between\nfunctors.\nFor example, let G be a group (or a monoid) viewed as a one-object category.\nAn object\nF ∈Fun(G, Ab) is simply a group action of G on F(∗) = A, i.e., a representation of G in abelian\ngroups. Given another F ′ ∈Fun(G, Ab) with F ′(∗) = A′, a natural transformation from F →F ′\nis precisely a G-equivariant homomorphism A →A′.\nCategorical language\nLet Vectk be the category of vector spaces over a field k, and linear transformations between them.\nGiven a vector space V , you can consider the dual V ∗= Hom(V, k). Does this give us a functor? If\nyou have a linear transformation f : V →W, you get a map f∗: W ∗→V ∗, so this is like a functor,\nbut the induced map goes the wrong way. This operation does preserve composition and identities,\nin an appropriate sense. This is an example of a contravariant functor.\nI'll leave it to you to spell out the definition, but notice that there is a univeral example of\na contravariant functor out of a category C: C →Cop, where Cop has the same objects as C, but\nCop(X, Y ) is declared to be the set C(Y, X). The identity morphisms remain the same. To describe\nthe composition in Cop, I'll write fop for f ∈C(Y, X) regarded as an element of Cop(X, Y ); then\nfop *gop = (g *f)op.\nThen a contravariant functor from C to D is the same thing as a (\"covariant\") functor from Cop\nto D.\nLet C be a category, and let Y ∈ob(C). We get a map Cop →Set that takes X 7→C(X, Y ), and\ntakes a map X →W to the map defined by composition C(W, Y ) →C(X, Y ). This is called the\nfunctor represented by Y . It is very important to note that C(-, Y ) is contravariant, while, on the\nother hand, for any fixed X, C(X, -) is a covariant functor (and is said to be \"corepresentable\" by\nX).\nExample 4.1. Recall that the simplex category ∆has objects the totally ordered sets [n] =\n{0, 1, . . . , n}, with order preserving maps as morphisms. The \"standard simplex\" gives us a functor\n∆: ∆→Top. Now fix a space X, and consider\n[n] 7→Top(∆n, X) .\nThis gives us a contravariant functor ∆→Set, or a covariant functor ∆op →Set. This functor\ncarries in it all the face and degeneracy maps we discussed earlier, and their compositions. Let us\nmake a definition.\n\n4. CATEGORICAL LANGUAGE\nDefinition 4.2. Let C be any category. A simplicial object in C is a functor K : ∆op →C. Simplicial\nobjects in C form a category with natural transformations as morphisms. Similarly, semi-simplicial\nobject in C is a functor ∆op\ninj →C,\nSo the singular functor Sin∗gives a functor from spaces to simplicial sets (and so, by restriction,\nto semi-simplicial sets).\nI want to interject one more bit of categorical language that will often be useful to us.\nDefinition 4.3. A morphism f : X →Y in a category C is a split epimorphism (\"split epi\" for short)\nif there exists g : Y →X (called a section or a splitting) such that the composite Y\ng-→X\nf-→Y is\nthe identity.\nExample 4.4. In the category of sets, a map f : X →Y is a split epimorphism exactly when, for\nevery element of Y there exists some element of X whose image in Y is the original element. So f is\nsurjective. Is every surjective map a split epimorphism? This is equivalent to the axiom of choice!\nbecause a section of f is precisely a choice of x ∈f-1(y) for every y ∈Y .\nEvery categorical definition is accompanied by a \"dual\" definition.\nDefinition 4.5. A map g : Y →X is a split monomorphism (\"split mono\" for short) if there is\nf : X →Y such that f *g = 1Y .\nExample 4.6. Again let C = Set. Any split monomorphism is an injection: If y, y′ ∈Y , and\ng(y) = g(y′), we want to show that y = y′. Apply f, to get y = f(g(y)) = f(g(y′)) = y′. But the\ninjection ∅→Y is a split monomorphism only if Y = ∅. So there's an asymmetry in the category\nof sets.\nLemma 4.7. A map is an isomorphism if and only if it is both a split epimorphism and a split\nmonomorphism.\nProof. Easy!\nThe importance of these definitions is this: Functors will not in general respect \"monomorphisms\"\nor \"epimorphisms,\" but:\nLemma 4.8. Any functor sends split epis to split epis and split monos to split monos.\nProof. Apply F to the diagram establishing f as a split epi or mono.\nExample 4.9. Suppose C = Ab, and you have a split epi f : A →B. Let g : B →A be a section.\nWe also have the inclusion i : ker f →A, and hence a map\n[ g\ni ] : B ⊕ker f →A .\nI leave it to you to check that this map is an isomorphism, and to formulate a dual statement.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.905 Algebraic Topology I\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "CHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nHomotopy, star-shaped regions\nWe've computed the homology of a point. Let's now compare the homology of a general space X\nto this example. There's always a unique map X →∗: ∗is a \"terminal object\" in Top. We have\nan induced map\nHn(X) →Hn(∗) =\n(\nZ\nn = 0\notherwise .\nAny formal linear combination c = P aixi of points of X is a 0-cycle. The map to ∗sends c to\nP ai ∈Z. This defines the augmentation ε : H∗(X) →H∗(∗). If X is nonempty, the map X →∗\nis split by any choice of point in X, so the augmentation is also split epi. The kernel of ε is the\nreduced homology eH∗(X) of X, and we get a canonical splitting\nH∗(X) ∼= eH∗(X) ⊕Z .\nActually, it's useful to extend the definition to the empty space by the following device. Extend\nthe singular chain complex for any space to include Z in dimension -1, with d : S0(X) →S-1(X)\ngiven by the augmentation ε sending each 0-simplex to 1 ∈Z. Let's write eS∗(X) for this chain\ncomplex, and eH∗(X) for its homology. When X = ∅, ε is surjective and you get the same answer\nas above. But\neHq(∅) =\n(\nZ\nfor q = -1\nfor q = -1 .\nThis convention is not universally accepted, but I find it useful. eH∗(X) is the reduced homology of\nX.\nWhat other spaces have trivial homology? A slightly non-obvious way to reframe the question\nis this:\nWhen do two maps X →Y induce the same map in homology?\nFor example, when do 1X : X →X and X →∗→X induce the same map in homology? If they\ndo, then ε : H∗(X) →Z is an isomorphism.\nThe key idea is that homology is a discrete invariant, so it should be unchanged by deformation.\nHere's the definition that makes \"deformation\" precise.\nDefinition 5.1. Let f0, f1 : X →Y be two maps. A homotopy from f0 to f1 is a map h : X×I →Y\n(continuous, of course) such that h(x, 0) = f0(x) and f(x, 1) = f1(x). We say that f0 and f1 are\nhomotopic, and that h is a homotopy between them. This relation is denoted by f0 ≃f1.\nHomotopy is an equivalence relation on maps from X to Y . Transitivity follows from the gluing\nlemma of point set topology. We denote by [X, Y ] the set of homotopy classes of maps from X to\nY . A key result about homology is this:\nTheorem 5.2 (Homotopy invariance of homology). If f0 ≃f1, then H∗(f0) = H∗(f1): homology\ncannot distinguish between homotopic maps.\nSuppose I have two maps f0, f1 : X →Y with a homotopy h : f0 ≃f1, and a map g : Y →Z.\nComposing h with g gives a homotopy between g *f0 and g *f1. Precomposing also works: If\n\n5. HOMOTOPY, STAR-SHAPED REGIONS\ng : W →X is a map and f0, f1 : X →Y are homotopic, then f0 *g ≃f1 *g. This lets us compose\nhomotopy classes: we can complete the diagram:\nTop(Y, Z) × Top(X, Y )\n\n/ Top(X, Z)\n\n[Y, Z] × [X, Y ]\n/ [X, Z]\nDefinition 5.3. The homotopy category (of topological spaces) Ho(Top) has the same objects as\nTop, but Ho(Top)(X, Y ) = [X, Y ] = Top(X, Y )/ ≃.\nWe may restate Theorem 5.2 as follows:\nFor each n, the homology functor Hn : Top →Ab factors as Top →Ho(Top) →Ab;\nit is a \"homotopy functor.\"\nWe will prove this in the next lecture, but let's stop now and think about some consequences.\nDefinition 5.4. A map f : X →Y is a homotopy equivalence if [f] ∈[X, Y ] is an isomorphism in\nHo(Top). In other words, there is a map g : Y →X such that fg ≃1Y and gf ≃1X.\nSuch a map g is a homotopy inverse for f; it is well-defined only up to homotopy.\nMost topological properties are not preserved by homotopy equivalences. For example, com-\npactness is not a homotopy-invariant property: Consider the inclusion i : Sn-1 ⊆Rn -{0}. A\nhomotopy inverse p : Rn -{0} →Sn-1 can be obtained by dividing a (always nonzero!) vector\nby its length. Clearly p *i = 1Sn-1. We have to find a homotopy i *p ≃1Rn-{0}. This is a map\n(Rn -{0}) × I →Rn -{0}, and we can use (v, t) 7→tv + (1 -t) v\n||v||.\nOn the other hand:\nCorollary 5.5. Homotopy equivalences induce isomorphisms in homology.\nProof. If f has homotopy inverse g, then f∗has inverse g∗.\nDefinition 5.6. A space X is contractible if the map X →∗is a homotopy equivalence.\nCorollary 5.7. Let X be a contractible space. The augmentation ε : H∗(X) →Z is an isomorphism.\nHomotopy equivalences in general may be somewhat hard to visualize. A particularly simple\nand important class of homotopy equivalences is given by the following definition.\nDefinition 5.8. An inclusion A ,→X is a deformation retract provided that there is a map h :\nX × I →X such that h(x, 0) = x and h(x, 1) ∈A for all x ∈X and h(a, t) = a for all a ∈A and\nt ∈I.\nFor example, Sn-1 is a deformation retract of Rn -{0}.\nWe now set about constructing a proof of homotopy invariance of homology. The first step is to\nunderstand the analogue of homotopy on the level of chain complexes.\nDefinition 5.9. Let C∗, D∗be chain complexes, and f0, f1 : C∗→D∗be chain maps. A chain\nhomotopy h : f0 ≃f1 is a collection of homomorphisms h : Cn →Dn+1 such that dh+hd = f1 -f0.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nThis relation takes some getting used to. It is an equivalence relation. Here's a picture (not a\ncommutive diagram).\n· · ·\n/ Cn+1\n\nd\n/ Cn\nh\n|\n\nd / Cn-1\nh\n|\n\n/ · · ·\n· · ·\n/ Dn+1\nd\n/ Dn\nd / Dn-1\n/ · · ·\nLemma 5.10. If f0, f1 : C∗→D∗are chain homotopic, then f0∗= f1∗: H∗(C) →H∗(D).\nProof. We want to show that for every c ∈Zn(C∗), the difference f1c -f0c is a boundary. Well,\nf1c -f0c = (dh + hd)c = dhc + hdc = dhc .\nSo homotopy invariance of homology will follow from\nProposition 5.11. Let f0, f1 : X →Y be homotopic. Then f0∗, f1∗: S∗(X) →S∗(Y ) are chain\nhomotopic.\nTo prove this we will begin with a special case.\nDefinition 5.12. A subset X ⊆Rn is star-shaped with respect to b ∈X if for every x ∈X the\ninterval\n{tb + (1 -t)x : t ∈[0, 1]}\nlies in X.\nAny nonempty convex region is star shaped.\nAny star-shaped region X is contractible: A\nhomotopy inverse to X →∗is given by sending ∗7→b. One composite is perforce the identity. A\nhomotopy from the other composite to the identity 1X is given by (x, t) 7→tb + (1 -t)x.\nSo we should expect that ε : H∗(X) →Z is an isomorphism if X is star-shaped. In fact, using\na piece of language that the reader can interpret:\nProposition 5.13. S∗(X) →Z is a chain homotopy equivalence.\nProof. We have maps S∗(X)\nε-→Z\nη-→S∗(X) where η(1) = c0\nb. Clearly εη = 1, and the claim is\nthat ηε ≃1 : S∗(X) →S∗(X). The chain map ηε concentrates everything at the point b: ηεσ = cn\nb\nfor all σ ∈Sinn(X). Our chain homotopy h : Sq(X) →Sq+1(X) will actually send simplices to\n\n6. HOMOTOPY INVARIANCE OF HOMOLOGY\nsimplices. For σ ∈Sinq(X), define the chain homotopy evaluated on σ by means of the following\n\"cone construction\": h(σ) = b ∗σ, where\n(b ∗σ)(t0, . . . , tq+1) = t0b + (1 -t0)σ\n(t1, . . . , tq+1)\n1 -t0\n\n.\nExplanation: The denominator 1 -t0 makes the entries sum to 1, as they must if we are to apply\nσ to this vector. When t0 = 1, this isn't defined, but it doesn't matter since we are multiplying by\n1 -t0. So (b ∗σ)(1, 0, . . . , 0) = b; this is the vertex of the cone.\nSetting t0 = 0, we find\nd0b ∗σ = σ .\nSetting ti = 0 for i > 0, we find\ndib ∗σ = hdi-1σ .\nUsing the formula for the boundary operator, we find\ndb ∗σ = σ -b ∗dσ\n. . . unless q = 0, when\ndb ∗σ = σ -c0\nb .\nThis can be assembled into the equation\ndb ∗+b ∗d = 1 -ηε\nwhich is what we wanted.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.905 Algebraic Topology I\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "The proof uses naturality (a lot). For a start, notice that if k : g0 ≃g1 : C∗→D∗is a chain\nhomotopy, and j : D∗→E∗is another chain map, then the composites j *kn : Cn →En+1 give\na chain homootpy j *g0 ≃j *g1.\nSo if we can produce a chain homotopy between the chain\nmaps induced by the two inclusions i0, i1 : X →X × I, we can get a chain homotopy k between\nf0∗= h∗*i0∗and f1∗= h∗*i1∗in the form h∗*k.\nSo now we want to produce a natural chain homotopy, with components kn : Sn(X) →Sn+1(X×\nI). The unit interval hosts a natural 1-simplex given by an identification ∆1 →I, and we should\nimagine k as being given by \"multiplying\" by that 1-chain. This \"multiplication\" is a special case of\na chain map\n× : S∗(X) × S∗(Y ) →S∗(X × Y ) ,\ndefined for any two spaces X and Y , with lots of good properties. It will ultimately be used to\ncompute the homology of a product of two spaces in terms of the homology groups of the factors.\nHere's the general result.\nTheorem 6.2. There exists a map × : Sp(X) × Sq(Y ) →Sp+q(X × Y ), the cross product, that is:\n- Natural, in the sense that if f : X →X′ and g : Y →Y ′, and a ∈Sp(X) and b ∈Sp(Y ) so\nthat a × b ∈Sp+q(X × Y ), then f∗(a) × g∗(b) = (f × g)∗(a × b).\n- Bilinear, in the sense that (a + a′) × b = (a × b) + (a′ × b), and a × (b + b′) = a × b + a × b′.\n- The Leibniz rule is satisfied, i.e., d(a × b) = (da) × b + (-1)pa × db.\n- Normalized, in the following sense. Let x ∈X and y ∈Y . Write jx : Y →X × Y for\ny 7→(x, y), and write iy : X →X × Y for x 7→(x, y). If b ∈Sq(Y ), then c0\nx × b = (jx)∗b ∈\nSq(X × Y ), and if a ∈Sp(X), then a × c0\ny = (iy)∗a ∈Sp(X × Y ).\nThe Leibniz rule contains the first occurence of the \"topologist's sign rule\"; we'll see these signs\nappearing often. Watch for when it appears in our proof.\nProof. We're going to use induction on p+q; the normalization axiom gives us the cases p+q = 0, 1.\nLet's assume that we've constructed the cross-product in total dimension p + q -1. We want to\ndefine σ × τ for σ ∈Sp(X) and τ ∈Sq(Y ).\nNote that there's a universal example of a p-simplex, namely the identity map ιp : ∆p →∆p.\nIt's universal in the sense any p-simplex σ : ∆p →X can be written as σ∗(ιp) where σ∗: Sinp(∆p) →\nSinp(X) is the map induced by σ. To define σ × τ in general, then, it suffices to define ιp × ιq ∈\nSp+q(∆p × ∆q); we can (and must) then take σ × τ = (σ × τ)∗(ιp × ιq).\nOur long list of axioms is useful in the induction. For one thing, if p = 0 or q = 0, normalization\nprovides us with a choice. So now assume that both p and q are positive. We want the cross-product\nto satisfy the Leibnitz rule:\nd(ιp × ιq) = (dιp) × ιq + (-1)pιp × dιq ∈Sp+q-1(∆p × ∆q)\nSince d2 = 0, a necessary condition for ιp × ιq to exist is that d((dιp) × ιq + (-1)pιp × dιq) = 0.\nLet's compute what this is, using the Leibnitz rule in dimension p + q -1 where we have it by the\ninductive assumption:\nd((dιp)×ιq+(-1)pιp×(dιq)) = (d2ιp)×ιq+(-1)p-1(dιp)×(dιq)+(-1)p(dιp)×(dιq)+(-1)qιp×(d2ιq) = 0\nbecause d2 = 0. Note that this calculation would not have worked without the sign!\nHomotopy invariance of homology\nWe now know that the homology of a star-shaped region is trivial: in such a space, every cycle with\naugmentation 0 is a boundary. We will use that fact, which is a special case of homotopy invariance\nof homology, to prove the general result, which we state in somewhat stronger form:\nTheorem 6.1. A homotopy h : f0 ≃ f1 : X → Y determines a natural chain homotopy f0∗ ≃ f1∗ : S∗(X)\n→ S∗(Y ).\n\n7. HOMOLOGY CROSS PRODUCT\nThe subspace ∆p×∆q ⊆Rp+1×Rq+1 is convex and nonempty, and hence star-shaped. Therefore\nwe know that Hp+q-1(∆p × ∆q) = 0 (remember, p + q > 1), which means that every cycle is a\nboundary. In other words, our necessary condition is also sufficient! So, choose any element with\nthe right boundary and declare it to be ιp × ιq.\nThe induction is now complete provided we can check that this choice satisfies naturality, bilin-\nearity, and the Leibniz rule. I leave this as a relaxing exercise for the listener.\nThe essential point here is that the space supporting the universal pair of simplices - ∆p × ∆q\n- has trivial homology. Naturality transports the result of that fact to the general situation.\nThe cross-product that this procedure constructs is not unique; it depends on a choice a choice\nof the chain ιp × ιq for each pair p, q with p + q > 1. The cone construction in the proof that\nstar-shaped regions have vanishing homology provids us with a specific choice; but it turns out that\nany two choices are equivalent up to natural chain homotopy.\nWe return to homotopy invariance.

Suppose we have three chain complexes A∗, B∗, and C∗, and suppose\nwe have maps × : Ap × Bq →Cp+q that satisfy bilinearity and the Leibniz formula. What does this\ninduce in homology?\nLemma 7.1. These data determine a bilinear map × : Hp(A) × Hq(B) →Hp+q(C).\nProof. Let a ∈Zp(A) and b ∈Zq(B). We want to define [a] × [b] ∈Hp+q(C). We hope that\n[a]×[b] = [a×b]. We need to check that a×b is a cycle. By Leibniz, d(a×b) = da×b+(-1)pa×db,\nwhich vanishes becauxe a, b are cycles.\nNow we need to check that homology class depends only on the homology classes we started\nwith. So pick other cycles a′ and b′ in the same homology classes. We want [a × b] = [a′ × b′]. In\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nother words, we need to show that a×b differs from a′ ×b′ by a boundary. We can write a′ = a+da\nand b′ = b + db, and compute, using bilinearity:\na′ × b′ = (a + da) + (b + db) = a × b + a × db + (da) × b + (da) × (db)\nWe need to deal with the last three terms here. But since da = 0,\nd(a × b) = (-1)pa × (db) .\nSince db = 0,\nd((a) × b) = (da) × b .\nAnd since d2b = 0,\nd(a × b) = (da) × (db) .\nThis means that a′ × b′ and a × b differ by\nd\n(-1)p(a × b) + a × b + a × db\n\n,\nand so are homologous.\nThe last step is to check bilinearity, which is left to the listener.\nThis gives the following result.\nTheorem 7.2. There is a map\n× : Hp(X) × Hq(Y ) →Hp+q(X × Y )\nthat is natural, bilinear, and normalized.\nWe will see that this map is also uniquely defined by these conditions, unlike the chain-level\ncross product.\nI just want to mention an explicit choice of ιp × ιq. This is called the Eilenberg-Zilber chain.\nYou're highly encouraged to think about this yourself. It comes from a triangulation of the prism.\nThe simplices in this triangulation are indexed by order preserving injections\nω : [p + q] →[p] × [q]\nInjectivity forces ω(0) = (0, 0) and ω(p + q) = (p, q). Each such map determines an affine map\n∆p+q →∆p × ∆q of the same name. These will be the singular simplices making up ιp × ιq. To\nspecify the coefficients, think of ω as a staircase in the rectangle [0, p] × [0, q]. Let A(ω) denote the\narea under that staircase. Then the Eilenberg-Zilber chain is given by\nιp × ιq =\nX\n(-1)A(ω)ω\n\n8. RELATIVE HOMOLOGY\nThis chain is due to Eilenberg and Mac Lane; the description appears in a paper [4] by Eilenberg\nand Moore. It's very pretty, but it's combinatorially annoying to check that this satisfies the\nconditions of the theorem. It provides an explicit chain map\nβX,Y : S∗(X) × S∗(Y ) → S∗(X × Y )\nthat satisfies many good properties on the nose and not just up to chain homotopy.

To justify this, we want to describe the sense in which\nhomology is \"additive.\" Here are two related aspects of this claim.\n1. If A ⊆X is a subspace, then H∗(X) a combination of H∗(A) and H∗(X -A).\n2. The homology H∗(A ∪B) is like H∗(A) + H∗(B) -H∗(A ∩B).\nThe first hope is captured by the long exact sequence of a pair, the second by the Mayer-Vietoris\nTheorem. Both facts show that homology behaves like a measure. The precise statement of both\nfacts uses the machinery of exact sequences. I'll use the following language.\nDefinition 8.1. A sequence of abelian groups is a diagram of abelian groups of the form\n· · · →Cn+1\nfn\n-→Cn\nfn-1\n---→Cn-1 →· · · ,\nin which all composites are zero; that is, im fn ⊆ker fn-1 for all n. It is exact at Cn provided that\nthis inequality is an equality.\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\n-\n-\nA sequence is just another name for a chain complex; it is exact at Cn if and only if Hn(C∗) = 0.\nSo homology measures the failure of exactness.\nExample 8.2. Sequences may be zero for n large or for n small. We may just not write them down\nif all the groups from some point on are zero. For example, 0 → A i→ B is exact iff i is injective,\nand B\np→ C → 0 is exact iff p is surjective.\nExactness was a key concept in the development of algebraic topology, and \"exact\" is a great word\nfor the concept. A foundational treatment [5] of algebraic topology was published by Sammy\nEilenberg and Norman Steenrod in 1952. The story goes that in the galleys for the book they left\na blank space whenever the word representing this concept was used, and filled it in at the last\nminute.\nDefinition 8.3. A short exact sequence is an exact sequence of the form\n0 →A i-→B\np-→C →0 .\nAny sequence of the form A →B →C expands to a diagram\nker(p)\n\"\nA\nO\ni\n/ B\np\n/\n#\nC\ncoker(i)\nO\nIt is exact at B if and only if A\n∼\n=\n-→ker p or, equivalently, coker(i)\n∼\n=\n-→C.\nIt is short exact if\nfurthermore i is injective and p is surjective.\nWe will study the homology of a space X by comparing it to the homology of a subspace A and\na complement or quotient modulo the subspace. Note that S∗(A) injects into S∗(X). This suggests\nconsidering the quotient group\nSn(X)\nSn(A) .\nThis is the group of relative n-chains of the pair (X, A).\nLet's formalize this a bit. Along with the category Top of spaces, we have the category Top2 of\npairs of spaces. An object of Top2 is a space X together with a subspace A. A map (X, A) →(Y, B)\nis a continuous map X →Y that sends A into B.\nThere are four obvious functors relating Top and Top2:\nX 7→(X, ∅) ,\nX 7→(X, X) ,\n(X, A) 7→X ,\n(X, A) 7→A .\nDo the relative chains form themselves into a chain complex?\nLemma 8.4. Let A∗be a subcomplex of the chain complex B∗. There is a unique structure of chain\ncomplex on the quotient graded abelian group C∗with entries Cn = Bn/An such that B∗→C∗is a\nchain map.\n\n9. THE HOMOLOGY LONG EXACT SEQUENCE\nProof. To define d : Cn →Cn-1, represent c ∈Cn by b ∈Bn, and hope that [db] ∈Bn-1/An-1 is\nwell defined. If we replace b by b + a for a ∈An, we find\nd(b + a) = db + da ≡db\nmod An-1 ,\nso our hope is justified. Then d2[b] = [d2b] = 0.\nDefinition 8.5. The relative singular chain complex of the pair (X, A) is\nS∗(X, A) = S∗(X)\nS∗(A) .\nThis is a functor from pairs of spaces to chain complexes. Of course\nS∗(X, ∅) = S∗(X) ,\nS∗(X, X) = 0 .\nDefinition 8.6. The relative singular homology of the pair (X, A) is the homology of the relative\nsingular chain complex:\nHn(X, A) = Hn(S∗(X, A)) .\nOne of the nice features of the absolute chain group Sn(X) is that it is free as an abelian group.\nThis is also the case for its quotent Sn(X, A), since the map Sn(A) →Sn(X) takes basis elements\nto basis elements. Sn(X, A) is freely generated by the n-simplices in X that do not lie entirely in\nA.\nExample 8.7. Consider ∆n, relative to its boundary\n∂∆n :=\n[\nim di ∼= Sn-1 .\nWe have the identity map ιn : ∆n →∆n, the universal n-simplex, in Sinn(∆n) ⊆Sn(∆n). It is not\na cycle; its boundary dιn ∈Sn-1(∆n) is the alternating sum of the faces of the n-simplex. Each\nof these singular simplices lies in ∂∆n, so dιn ∈Sn-1(∂∆n), and [ιn] ∈Sn(∆n, ∂∆n) is a relative\ncycle. We will see that the relative homology Hn(∆n, ∂∆n) is infinite cyclic, with generator [ιn].\nThe homology long exact sequence\nA pair of spaces (X, A) gives rise to a short exact sequence of chain complexes:\n0 →S∗(A) →S∗(X) →S∗(X, A) →0 .\nIn homology, this will relate H∗(A), H∗(X), and H∗(X, A).\nTo investigate what happens, let's suppse we have a general short exact sequence of chain\ncomplexes,\n0 →A∗→B∗→C∗→0 ,\nand study what happens in homology. Clearly the composite H∗(A) →H∗(B) →H∗(C) is trivial.\nIs this sequence exact? Let [b] ∈Hn(B) such that g([b]) = 0. It's determined by some b ∈Bn\nsuch that d(b) = 0. If g([b]) = 0, then there is some c ∈Cn+1 such that dc = gb. Now, g is\nsurjective, so there is some b ∈Bn+1 such that g(b) = c. Then we can consider db ∈Bn, and\ng(d(b)) = d(c) ∈Cn. What is b -db? This maps to zero in Cn, so by exactness there is some\na ∈An such that f(a) = b -db. Is a a cycle? Well, f(da) = d(fa) = d(b -db) = db -d2b = db,\nbut we assumed that db = 0, so f(da) = 0. This means that da is zero because f is an injection by\n\nBibliography\n[1] M. G. Barratt and J. Milnor, An example of anomalous singular homology, Proc. Amer. Math.\nSoc. 13 (1962) 293-297.\n[2] G.

If two of the three maps induced in homology\nby f, g, and h are isomorphisms, then so is the third.\nHere's an application.\nProposition 9.6. Let (A, X) →(B, Y ) be a map of pairs, and assume that two of A →B, X →Y ,\nand (X, A) →(Y, B) induce isomorphims in homology. Then the third one does as well.\nProof. Just apply the five lemma to the map between the two homology long exact sequences.\nExcision and applications\nWe have found two general properties of singular homology: homotopy invariance and the long\nexact sequence of a pair. We also claimed that H∗(X, A) \"depends only on X -A.\" You have to\nbe careful about this. The following definition gives conditions that will capture the sense in which\nthe relative homology of a pair (X, A) depends only on the complement of A in X.\nDefinition 10.1. A triple (X, A, U) where U ⊆A ⊆X, is excisive if U ⊆Int(A). The inclusion\n(X -U, A -U) ⊆(X, A) is then called an excision.\nTheorem 10.2. An excision induces an isomorphism in homology,\nH∗(X -U, A -U)\n∼\n=\n-→H∗(X, A) .\n\n10. EXCISION AND APPLICATIONS\nSo you can cut out closed bits of the interior of A without changing the relative homology. The\nproof will take us a couple of days. Before we give applications, let me pose a different way to\ninterpret the motto \"H∗(X, A) depends only on X -A.\" Collapsing the subspace A to a point gives\nus a map of pairs\n(X, A) →(X/A, ∗) .\nWhen does this map induce an isomorphism in homology? Excision has the following consequence.\nCorollary 10.3. Assume that there is a subspace B of X such that (1) A ⊆IntB and (2) A →B\nis a deformation retract. Then\nH∗(X, A) →H∗(X/A, ∗)\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. The diagram of pairs\n(X, A)\n\ni\n/ (X, B)\n\n(X -A, B -A)\nk\n\nj\no\n(X/A, ∗)\nı\n/ (X/A, B/A)\n(X/A -∗, B/A -∗)\n\no\ncommutes. We want the left vertical to be a homology isomorphism, and will show that the rest of\nthe perimeter consists of homology isomorphisms. The map k is a homeomorphism of pairs while j\nis an excision by assumption (1). The map i induces an isomorphism in homology by assumption\n(2), the long exact sequences, and the five-lemma. Since I is a compact Hausdorffspace, the map\nB × I →B/A × I is again a quotient map, so the deformation B × I →B, which restricts to the\nconstant deformation on A, descends to show that ∗→B/A is a deformation retract. So the map\nı is also a homology isomorphism. Finally, ∗⊆Int(B/A) in X/A, by definition of the quotient\ntopology, so induces an isomorphism by excision.\nNow what are some consequences? For a start, we'll finally get around to computing the ho-\nmology of the sphere. It happens simultaneously with a computation of H∗(Dn, Sn-1). (Note that\nS-1 = ∅.) To describe generators, for each n ≥0 pick a homeomorphism\n(∆n, ∂∆n) →(Dn, Sn-1) ,\nand write\nιn ∈Sn(Dn, Sn-1)\nfor the corresponding relative n-chain.\nProposition 10.4. Let n > 0 and let ∗∈Sn-1 be any point. Then:\nHq(Sn) =\n\nZ = ⟨[∂ιn+1]⟩\nif\nq = n > 0\nZ = ⟨[c0\n∗]⟩\nif\nq = 0, n > 0\nZ ⊕Z = ⟨[c0\n∗], [∂ι1]⟩\nif\nq = n = 0\notherwise\nand\nHq(Dn, Sn-1) =\n(\nZ = ⟨[ιn]⟩\nif\nq = n\notherwise .\n\nCHAPTER 1. SINGULAR HOMOLOGY\nProof. The division into cases for Hq(Sn) can be eased by employing reduced homology. Then the\nclaim is merely that for n ≥0\neHq(Sn-1) =\n(\nZ\nif\nq = n -1\nif\nq = n -1\nand the map\n∂: Hq(Dn, Sn-1) →eHq-1(Sn-1)\nis an isomorphism. The second statement follows from the long exact sequence in reduced homology\ntogether with the fact that eH∗(Dn) = 0 since Dn is contractible. The first uses induction and the\npair of isomorphisms\neHq-1(Sn-1)\n∼\n=\n←-Hq(Dn, Sn-1)\n∼\n=\n-→Hq(Dn/Sn-1, ∗)\nsince Dn/Sn-1 ∼= Sn. The right hand arrow is an isomorphism since Sn-1 is a deformation retract\nof a neighborhood in Dn.\nWhy should you care about this complicated homology calculation?\nCorollary 10.5. If m = n, then Sm and Sn are not homotopy equivalent.\nProof. Their homology groups are not isomorphic.\nCorollary 10.6. If m = n, then Rm and Rn are not homeomorphic.\nProof. If m or n is zero, this is clear, so let m, n > 0. Assume we have a homeomorphism f : Rm →\nRn. This restricts to a homeomorphism Rm -{0} →Rn -{f(0)}. But these spaces are homotopy\nequivalent to spheres of different dimension.\nTheorem 10.7 (Brouwer fixed-point theorem). If f : Dn →Dn is continuous, then there is some\npoint x ∈Dn such that f(x) = x.\nProof. Suppose not. Then you can draw a ray from f(x) through x. It meets the boundary of Dn\nat a point g(x) ∈Sn-1. Check that g : Dn →Sn-1 is continuous. If x is on the boundary, then\nx = g(x), so g provides a factorization of the identity map on Sn-1 through Dn. This is inconsistent\nwith our computation because the identity map induces the identity map on eHn-1(Sn-1) ∼= Z, while\neHn-1(Dn) = 0.\n\n11. THE EILENBERG STEENROD AXIOMS AND THE LOCALITY PRINCIPLE\nOur computation of the homology of a sphere also implies that there are many non-homotopic\nself-maps of Sn, for any n ≥1.\nWe will distinguish them by means of the \"degree\": A map\nf : Sn →Sn induces an endomorphism of the infinite cyclic group Hn(Sn). Any endomorphism\nof an infinite cyclic group is given by multiplication by an integer. This integer is well defined\n(independent of a choice of basis), and any integer occurs. Thus End(Z) = Z×, the monoid of\nintegers under multiplication. The homotopy classes of self-maps of Sn also form a monoid, under\ncomposition, and:\nTheorem 10.8. Let n ≥1. The degree map provides us with a surjective monoid homomorphism\ndeg : [Sn, Sn] →Z× .\nProof. Degree is multiplicative by functoriality of homology.\nWe construct a map of degree k on Sn by induction on n. If n = 1, this is just the winding\nnumber; an example is given by regarding S1 as unit complex numbers and sending z to zk. The\nproof that this has degree k is an exercise.\nSuppose we've constructed a map fk : Sn-1 →Sn-1 of degree k. Extend it to a map fk : Dn →\nDn by defining fk(tx) = tfk(x) for t ∈[0, 1]. We may then collapse the sphere to a point and\nidentify the quotient with Sn. This gives us a new map gk : Sn →Sn making the diagram below\ncommute.\nHn-1(Sn-1)\nfk∗\n\nHn(Dn, Sn-1)\n∼\n=\no\n∼\n=\n/\n\nHn(Sn)\ngk∗\n\nHn-1(Sn-1)\nHn(Dn, Sn-1)\n∼\n=\no\n∼\n=\n/ Hn(Sn)\nThe horizontal maps are isomorphisms, so deg gk = k as well.\nWe will see (in 18.906) that this map is in fact an isomorphism.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.905 Algebraic Topology I\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
