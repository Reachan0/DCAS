Chapter 10, Exercise 6.4 (characters of the octahedral group).\n2. Chapter 10, Exercise 6.9 (identify simple groups from character table).\n3. A connected finite graph is called harmonic if it has the extra structure of\n1) a positive integer weight d(γ) labeling each vertex γ; and\n2) a special vertex called γ0, with d(γ0) = 1\nsubject to the following requirement: for every vertex γ,\n2d(γ) =\nd(γ0).\nedges {γ,γ0 }\nThat is, the label of each vertex is half the sum of the labels of adjacent vertices. The problem is\nto classify all possible harmonic graphs. (Here is one family of examples, to get you started. Fix\nan integer N ≥ 3. Let the vertices be the vertices of a regular N-gon, and the edges the usual\nedges. Label each vertex with a 1, and pick one vertex to call γ0. Since each vertex has exactly\ntwo adjacent vertices, it's easy to see that this is a harmonic graph.)\n4. Suppose G is a finite subgroup of SU2. Write (τ, C2) for the defining representation of G;\nthe τ stands for \"tautological.\" Now make a graph having one vertex γ for every (equivalence class\nof) irreducible representation (γ, Vγ ) of G. There is a distinguished vertex γ0 corresponding to the\ntrivial representation of G.\nJoin the vertex γ0 to γ by e(γ0, γ) (directed) edges if the irreducible representation γ0 appears\ne(γ0, γ) times in the representation Hom(τ, γ).\na) Show that e(γ0, γ) is equal to\nhχ0\nγ , χτ χγ i = |G|-1\nχγ0 (g) χτ (g)χγ (g).\ng∈G\nb) Show that e(γ0, γ) = e(γ, γ0); so we can think of the edges as undirected.\nc) Label each vertex γ by d(γ) = dim Vγ . Show that the graph is harmonic. (The hard part is\nshowing that the graph is connected; I haven't really explained how you might prove that. So\ndon't worry if that's the only part you can't figure out.)\nd) In section 6.12 you studied finite subgroups of SO3. In section 9.4 you studied a two-to-one\nmap from SU2 to SO3. Every finite subgroup F of SO3 has a preimage Fe in SU2 having twice\nas many elements, and called the binary something or other. For example, the preimage Ie of\nthe icosahedral group is called the binary icosahedral group; it has 120 elements. In your list\nof harmonic graphs from problem 3, decide which ones correspond to the binary groups Te, Oe,\nand Ie (of orders 24, 48, and 120).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.702 Algebra II\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "18.702\nMay 4, 2011\nConstructing the 17-gon\nThe computations are taken farther than what is in the text.\nGauss showed that one can contruct the 17-gon with ruler and compass. To prove that this is possible,\nit suffices\n\nto construct cos α, α = 2\n17 , which we can write in terms of the primitive 17th root of unity.\nIf = ei and ζ = + -1, then cos α = 1\n2 ζ.\nWhat we know about ruler and compass constructions is that ζ can be constructed if and only if it\nlies in a field that is obtained from the rational numbers by repeatly adjoining real square roots.\nLet F = Q and K = F (). The irreducible polynomial for over F is\nf(x) = x 16 + x 15 + · · · + x + 1.\nThe Galois group G of K over F is a cyclic group of order 16, isomorphic to the multiplicative group\nF×\n17.\nThe multiplicative group is generated by the residue of 3, i.e., the powers of 3,\n\n= 1, 31 = 3, 32 = 9, 33 = 10, ...,\nlist the elements\n\nof F×\n17. Taking the corresponding powers of lists the powers of different from 1 in\nthis order: (We represent congruence classes modulo 17 by the integers between -8 and 8.)\n1, 3, -8, -7, -4, 5, -2, -6, -1\n\n, -3, 8, 7, 4, -5, 2, 6.\nThese are the roots of f. Their sum is -1.\nThere is a corresponding generator β for the cyclic Galois group G = C-1, namely the automorphism\nsuch that β = 3 and βi = 3i . This automorphism permutes the powers cyclically in the order\nabove:\n1 ! 3\n\n! -8 ! -7 ! -4 ! 5 ! -2 ! -6 !\n! -1 ! -3 !\n\n8 ! 7 ! 4 ! -5 ! 2 ! 6 (! 1).\nNext, the subgroups of G are the cyclic groups\nC16 C8 C4 C2 C1\ngenerated by β, β2, β4, β8, and β16 = 1 respectively.\nGalois Theory tells us that the subfields of K are the fixed fields of these subgroups, and that these\nfixed fields form a chain\nF = L0 →L1 →L2 →L3 → L4 = K,\nwhere\nL\n< >\n1 = K\n, etc. Moreover, there are no other subgroups, and therefore no other intermediate\nfields. Each of the four extensions making up this chain has degree 2, so the tower of fields can be\nconstructed by repeatedly adjoining square roots.\nNotice that, with ζ = 1 + -1 as above, is a root of the quadratic polynomial\n(z - )(z - -1) = z 2 - ζz + 1,\n\nq\nq\nwhich has coefficients in F (ζ). Therefore K has degree 1 or 2 over F (ζ). Since ζ is a real number but\nis not real, F (ζ)\nR, and K √→ R. Therefore the degree of K over F (ζ) is equal to 2, from which\n→\nit follows that F (ζ) = L3. Since ζ ⊃ L3\nR, the square roots needed to reach the field L3 are real.\n→\nThis proves that the 17-gon can be constructed by ruler and compass.\nIt isn't too hard to compute the necessary square roots explicitly. First, L1 is the fixed field of β2 .\nSince β2 sends\n-8 -4 -2 -1 8 4 2 ,\nthe sum of these powers, which we'll denote by , is fixed by β2 . It seems cumbersome to carry all\nof these 's along, so we abbreviate, writing the sum symbolically as = [1, -8, -4, -2, -1, 8, 4, 2].\nThe remaining powers of form another orbit whose sum is 0 = [3, -7, 5, -6, -3, 7, -5, 6]. Then\n+ 0 = -1. We expand 0, obtaining a sum of 64 terms 1+3 + 1-7 +\n. The exponent 0 = 17\n· · ·\ndoes not occur among these powers. Since 0 is a rational number, and the powers different from\n1 form an orbit under the group, they occur the same number of times, i.e., 4 times, and 0 = -4.\nThen and 0 are roots of\ng(x) = x + x - 4 :\n, 0 = 2 (-1 ±\np\n17).\nIt isn't difficult to see, by sketching the 17th roots of 1, that > 0 . So the sign is + for . Anyway,\nL1 is the quadratic extension F (\np\n17) of F .\nNext, L2 is the fixed field of β4, and β4 sends\n-4 -1 4 .\nThe sum of these elements is fixed by β4 . Let\n1 = [1, -4, -1, 4],\n2 = [3, 5, -3, -5],\n3 = [-8, -2, 8, 2],\n4 = [-7, -6, 7, 6].\nEach of these sums is fixed by β4, and therefore is in L2. Then 1 + 3 = , and 13 = -1. So 1\nand 3 are roots of\nh(y) = y 2 - y - 1.\nSimilarly, 2 and 4 are roots of h1(y) = y2 - 0y - 1. The discriminants of h and h0 are 2 + 4 =\n8 - = 2\n1 (17 -\np\n17) and 8 - 0 = 2\n1 (17 +\np\n17) respectively. Let\nθ0\nθ =\nq\n(17 -\np\n17),\n=\nq\n(17 +\np\n17).\nEither of these elements will generate the field L2.\nIncidentally, the elements θ, θ0 give us another example of nested square roots with cyclic Galois\ngroup. There is only one intermediate field of degree 2. Here θθ0 =\n1 (172 - 17) =\n1 (17 16) =\n·\np\n17.\nWe continue, solving the quadratic equations for i:\n1, 3 = 1 ( ± θ),\nand 2, 4 = 1 (0 ± θ0).\nHere 1 > 3 and 2 > 4, so\n1 = 2\n1 ( + θ),\nand 2 = 2\n1 (0 + θ0).\n\nThe subfield of K of degree 4 over F is generated by θ. Since there is a unique subfield of degree 4, θ0\ngenerates the same field.\nFinally, let\n1]\n\nζ = [1, -,\nand ζ0 = [-4, 4] = β4ζ.\nThen +\n\nζ\nζ0 =\nand ζ\n1,\nζ = [-3, 5, -5, 3] =\nSo ζ, ζ0\n2.\nare roots of\n\nk(z) = z 2 - 1z + 2.\nThe field extension generated by ζ is obtained from F (1) by adjoining the square root of the discrim\ninant =\n1 - 42. Expanding the sum for\nfinds\n\n1, one\n1 = 3 + 22 + 4, so\n= 3 - 2\n\n2 + 4 = 2( - θ) - ( + θ ) + 4 = 4(17 + 3\np\n17) - 2θ - θ .\n\nWe compute θ0 in terms of θ finding that θ0 = - 10θ\n= (1 +\n17)θ. Then\n\np\n\n4 = 17 + 3\np\n17 - 3θ\np\n\n3 +\np\n\np\np\n-\n17θ =\n-\nq\n2(17 -\n17) .\n\nUnless I've made an error, the field F (ζ) is generated by\n\ns\n\n3 +\np\np\np\n-\nq\n2(17 -\n17)\n\n.\n\nI haven't computed ζ explicitly.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.702 Algebra II\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
