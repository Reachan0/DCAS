One way to do this is to\nchange the carrier concentration in a semiconductor through an applied potential.

This can lead to photon\nswitching in optimized device geometry.\nA simplified concept of this device is simply a p-n junction, shown schematically below.\nhν\nMetallurgical\njunction\nn+=1020 cm-3\np=NA cm-3\nX1\nX0\nNote this is a n+-p junction.
