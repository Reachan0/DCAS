Compare the heart rate and blood pressure at time = +100 sec to the baseline values\nat time = -10 sec. What is the physiologic basis for the observed change in arterial BP?\n\nDescription: Before and after the stand test, the heart rate remains fixed at 68 beats/min.\nThe systemic arterial pressure (ABP) is 117/72 mmHg (average = 94.5 mmHg) while\nsupine, but it decreases sharply upon standing and has dropped to 60/37 mmHg (average\n= 48.5 mmHg) by the time 100 seconds have passed.\n\nAnalysis: When a human moves from a supine to standing position, there is a major\ntranslocation of the body's blood; it shifts towards the feet and pools in the veins of the\nleg. This shift into the leg veins is effectively an increase in the venous zero pressure\nfilling volume (ZPFV). Since veins are elastic, increasing the ZPFV causes an increase of\nblood volume in the veins before any stretch in the wall of the veins (and any pressure)\nappears. Assuming that the volume of blood in the body doesn't chance, there is less\nblood in the other parts of the cardiovascular system, including in the systemic arteries.\nTherefore, the pressure drops in the systemic arteries. With the \"operational control\nsystems\" switched off, the baroreflex cannot do its job of signaling the heart to increase\nits cardiac output. Therefore, the heart rate does not increase upon standing in this \"no-\ncontrol\" case.\n\n2. The curves in Figure 3 show the patient's status at time = -10 sec. Using the axes\nprovided, sketch CO/VR curves and a LV P-V loop to represent the hemodynamics at\ntime = +100 sec. (Hint: First estimate the new CO assuming constant peripheral\nresistance.)\n\nThe post-standing LV P-V loop is determined by the post-standing systolic pressure (60\nmmHg), the post-standing diastolic pressure (38 mmHg), and the post-standing stroke\n1 of 5\n\nvolume (SV is proportional to pulse pressure, which is systolic pressure minus diastolic\npressure Æ since the post-standing pulse pressure is about half the pre-standing pulse\npressure, the post-standing SV is about half of the pre-standing SV. SV is the distance\nbetween the two vertical lines in the cardiac cycle, so the pre-standing SV is about 75 cc.\nThus, the post-standing SV is about 38 cc.) In this solution set's Figure 2, the points in\nthe cardiac cycle are labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Cycle point #3 is determined by the\nintersection of the 60 mmHg systolic pressure and the already-drawn systole curve.\nThen, point #2 must be the point that is one stroke volume (38 cc) to the right of point #3\nand at a pressure of 38 mmHg. Point #1 must lie on the diastole curve but at the same\nvolume of point #2. Finally, point #4 lies just above the diastole curve but at the same\nvolume of point #3.\n\nThe post-standing venous return curve is determined by estimating the post-standing\ncardiac output, CO. We know that cardiac output is equal to stroke volume times heart\nrate (CO = HR*SV), and that stroke volume is proportional to pulse pressure. In the\nprevious paragraph, we discussed that the pulse pressure, and thus the stroke volume,\ndecrease by a factor of two upon standing. Consequently, the cardiac output also\ndecreases by a factor of two (in other words, it is cut in half). To draw the new venous\nreturn curve, we place the equilibrium point on 0 mmHg right atrial pressure but at half\nthe cardiac output. Then, we draw the rest of the venous return curve with the same slope\nas the pre-standing venous return curve.\n\nTo intersect the venous return curve but also maintain an equilibrium point at 0 mmHg,\nthe post-standing cardiac output curve must move to the right and have a decrease in\nslope.\n\n2 of 5\n\n3. What sensors and effectors are responsible for the behavior of heart rate and BP in\nFigure 4? What is the primary effector mechanism responsible for the initial increase\nin HR?\n\nThe sensors responsible for the behavior of heart rate and blood pressure during the stand\ntest are the atrial stretch receptors, which sense for blood volume, and the baroreceptors,\nwhich sense for pressure. The relevant effectors are heart rate, contractility, venous tone,\nand peripheral resistance. The primary effector mechanism that initiates the increase in\nHR is the sympathetic stimulus, brought on by the baroreceptor reflex.\n\n4. Why is the mean BP at 100 seconds slightly higher than the control level? (You may\nuse the approximation Pm = Pd + 1/3 (Ps - Pd ).)\n\nMean BP is equal to cardiac output times total peripheral resistance (Pm = CO * TPR).\nWith sympathetic stimulation working (i.e., control system \"on\"), the peripheral\nresistance increases substantially while the cardiac output decreases just slightly. The net\neffect is an increase in the product of CO and TPR, or an increase in Pm. Another way to\nlook at this is that increased peripheral resistance causes an increase in diastolic pressure\nwithout much of a change to systolic pressure. Thus, the mean pressure increases upon\nstanding.\n\n5. Using the axes of Figure 3 sketch the new situation at t = 100 sec. Demonstrate the\nexpected impact of the control mechanisms by appropriately modifying the curves.\nHint: Estimate the new CO by assuming that stroke volume is proportional to pulse\npressure (systolic-diastolic ABP). Fill in the work sheet below as a guide to drawing\nthe curves.\n\nParameter\nt = -10 sec\nt = 100 sec\nHR\n(from Assign. Fig. 4) 68 bpm\n78 bpm\nCO\n(from Assign. Fig. 3)5000 cc/min\n60 cc * 78 bpm = 4680 cc/min\nSV\nSV = CO/HR = 5000 cc/68 = 74 cc\n36 * 74/44 = 60 cc\nPulse Press.\nPs - Pd = 116 - 72 = 44 mmHg\nPs - Pd = 118-82 = 36 mmHg\nMean ABP\n(from Assign. Fig. 4) 95 mmHg\n(from Assign. Fig. 4) 102 mmHg\n\n(Follow procedure of Problem 2 to create the LV P-V curve.)\n\n[CORRECTION:] It is important to note that the data given to us in Problem 5 indicates\nthat the stroke volume decreases, and this precludes the possibility of increased\ncontractility, which is a control mechanism that would typically happen upon sympathetic\nstimulation. (Increased contractility causes stroke volume to increase rather than to\ndecrease.) According to Problem 5's assumption that stroke volume is proportional to\npulse pressure, stroke volume decreases upon standing. Consequently, the venous return\ncurve must also decrease, as shown in Figure 3.\n3 of 5\n\nHowever, the data for Problem 5 does indicate the normal sympathetic response of an\nincrease in heart rate, so the cardiac output curve does move up and to the left. Figure 3\nshows the post-standing curves that correspond to the data in Problem 5.\n\nIn a normally-functioning CV system, sympathetic stimulation normally causes increased\ncontractility, constriction of veins, decreased venous capacitance, and increased mean\nsystem pressure - hence, if the increased contractility had occurred along with the\nincreased heart rate, the venous return curve would have moved up and to the right [as in\nthe original figure in the uncorrected solution set], and the stroke volume would have\nincreased rather than decreased.\n\n6. What shifts of blood volume would you expect in the early hours of weightlessness?\nExplain your rationale.\n\nIn the absence of gravity, first the blood that is normally attracted towards the feet will\nshift and be redistributed in the upper parts of the body. This is part of the total body fluid\nshift that occurs when weightlessness begins. Next, the volume sensors that are used to\nmeasure pressure at the atria will detect the increase in upper-body blood volume and\nthus measure the increase in upper-body pressure that has occurred. To reduce the\npressure in the upper body, the cardiovascular control system takes action to reduce the\nvolume of blood in the body by eliminating plasma through urine. Consequently, after a\nfew hours of weightlessness, there will be a significant reduction in total blood volume.\n\n4 of 5\n\n7. Why is the post-flight stand test result different from the pre-flight result?\n\nAs described above, the microgravity environment eventually causes a loss of total blood\nvolume (typically about 500 mL are lost). Furthermore, the heart's cardiac output\ndecreases because the removal of the hydrostatic pressure gradient requires much less\nwork from the heart. When the astronaut returns to gravity and conducts a stand test, the\nheart must compensate for the decreased blood volume and decreased cardiac output by\nproducing a much larger increase in heart rate upon standing.\n\nWhile total blood volume has the largest effect on the heart rate increase, we can mention\nat least three additional spaceflight-induced causes of the difference between the post-\nflight and pre-flight responses to standing. They include:\n1) reduction in arterial resistance gain (decreased ability to increase peripheral\nresistance)\n2) reduction in heart rate gain (because of reduced vagal component of baroreflex)\n3) reduction in venous tone (decreased ability to constrict veins).\nThese three reductions are all a result of decreased peripheral sympathetic\nneurotransmission (in other words, decreased sympathetic gain). The sympathetic gain\ndecreases because the lack of hydrostatic pressure gradient means that the baroreflex is\nnot used in microgravity.\n\n8. Can you think of any countermeasures to reduce the problem of orthostatic\nhypotension? (Consider mechanical, pharmacological, or other methods.)\n\n-\nFluid loading immediately before return to gravity\n-\nPharmaceuticals, that cause increase in total peripheral resistance or stroke\nvolume\n-\nPharmaceuticals that increase heart rate\n-\nMechanical counterpressure around legs to augment venous return\n-\nAerobic exercise in space to maintain oxygen uptake rate\n5 of 5"

      "content": "Solutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\nBone Homework Solution Set\nPROBLEM 1.\nSection modulus of idealized femoral shafts:\nWe find the section modulus, Z, by the equation Z = I/ro, where I = 0.25π(ro\n4 - ri ), simplified as\nZ = (0.25πro\n4 - 0.25πiri )/ ro\n(1)\nFor adult males of age 25, Z is 2.90 cm3\n.\nFor adult females of age 25, Z is 1.79 cm3 .\nOuter radius, ro, as a function of changing inner radius, ri:\nAs years pass, and a human's osteoblasts and osteoclasts are constantly reforming and absorbing bone.\nThis dynamic process can result in changes in both inner and outer dimensions of the cortical layer of\nthe bone, but bone strength can nevertheless be maintained. If the load on the skeleton remains constant,\nthen the bones can maintain constant strain rate if they maintain a constant section modulus.\nConsequently, if the inner radius of the cortical layer increases due to bone remodeling, a correspondent\nincrease in outer radius due to bone modeling can prevent a change in bone section modulus. We can\nsee this section modulus maintenance by returning to Equation (1):\nZ = (0.25πro\n4 - 0.25πiri )/ ro\nWe set Z to be a constant and allow the inner radius ri to increase linearly with time. For this problem ri\nincreases by 0.004 cm/year, a value which we can call rrate. We can collect outer radius, ro, terms on one\nside and ri terms on the other side of the equation. Then we can solve iteratively for the outer radius ro,\nwhich is found implicitly in Equation (2). The variable t is the time in years since the starting\nconditions.\n0.25πro\n4 - Zro = 0.25π (ri,initial + 0.004t)4\n(2)\nI used an iterative loop in Matlab to calculate the outer radius for each year between age 25 and age 95,\nsubject to the inner radius increasing by 0.004 cm/year and the section modulus remaining constant (at\neither 2.90 cm3 for males or 1.79 cm3 for females). The Matlab code is attached.\nThe results show that it is indeed physically possible for the outer radius to increase in such a way that\nthe section modulus remains the same when the inner radius increases. For a female aging from 25\nyears old to 80 years old, the outer radius increases from 1.40 cm to 1.49 cm to compensate for an inner\nradius change from 0.90 cm to 1.12 cm. In other words, in 55 years, a 6.4% increase in ro occurs for a\n24% increase in ri. For males going from age 25 to age 80, a 6.5% increase in ro occurs for an 18%\nincrease in ri. Even at age 80, for both females and males, the inner radius is sufficiently smaller than the\nouter radius as to make physical sense for the bone's cortical thickness: for females, the thickness\n(ro - ri) decreases from 0.50 cm at age 25 to 0.37 cm at age 80.\n\nSolutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\nThe following figures show the change in cortical layer inner and outer radii with time.\nFigure 1: Inner and outer radius changes with time for average female, under constant skeletal loading\nFigure 2: Inner and outer radius changes with time for average male, under constant skeletal loading\n\nSolutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\nEffect on bone mineral density, BMD:\nThe above figures show that the section modulus can remain constant due to an increasing outer radius\nas remodeling increases the inner radius. While section modulus is stablilized, the areal mineral density\nof bone, BMD, does not remain constant. BMD decreases as remodeling takes away from the inside of\nthe cortical layer and modeling adds to the outside. Figure 3 shows the percent change in BMD for\nfemales and males subject to the above changes in inner and outer cortical bone radii. At age 80,\nfemales have experienced a 20% decrease from age-25 BMD. Males have experienced an 18%\ndecrease. It is important to note that this reduction in BMD does not necessarily imply a reduction in\nbone strength. In fact, the increase in outer radius observed above can compensate for the loss in BMD.\nFigure 3: Percent change in BMD over time, for constant skeletal loading and 0.004 cm/yr remodeling\n\nSolutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\nPROBLEM 2:\nEffect of doubling and quadrupling the remodeling rate:\nDoubling and quadrupling the remodeling rate are the equivalent of changing rrate (rate of increase of the\ninner radius) to 0.008 cm/year and 0.016 cm/year, respectively. With a doubled remodeling rate, to\nmaintain a constant section modulus, an 80-year-old female would have an outer femoral shaft radius of\n1.62 cm (a 16% increase from age 25). An 80-year-old male would have an outer radius of 1.95 cm (a\n15% increase from age 25). If the remodeling rate were quadrupled, up to 0.016 cm/year, an 80-year-\nold female would have an outer femoral shaft radius of 1.95 cm (a 39% increase from age 25) to\nmaintain constant Z. An 80-year-old male experiencing this remodeling rate would have an outer radius\nof 2.28 cm (a 34% increase from age 25)! Combining these outer radius values with the age-80 inner\nradius values result in cortical thicknesses of only 0.17 cm (compared to 0.5 cm at age 25).\nFigures 4 through 7 show the trends for percent changes in outer radius, inner radius, and BMD as time\ngoes on, for the doubled and quadrupled remodeling rates.\nNotice that it still appears to be physically possible to maintain bone strength even as 0.016 cm of the\ninner radius of the cortical shell is being absorbed each year.\nFigure 4: Female with 0.008 cm/year remodeling\nFigure 5: Male with 0.008 cm/year remodeling\nFigure 6: Female with 0.016 cm/year remodeling\nFigure 7: Male with 0.016 cm/year remodeling\n\nSolutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\nPROBLEM 3.\nVariable loading profile:\nFor skeletal loading to be reduced 30% by age 60, I assume that the loading profile decreases linearly\nbetween ages 35 and 60. Before age 35, it is constant at 100%, and after age 60, it is constant at 70%.\nIn between these ages, I assume that a person's activity level gradually decreases and that consequently,\nhis or her skeletal loading gradually decreases. The years between age 35 and 60 correspond to the time\nwhen a person's children might be adolescents and young adults, when they require much less physical\nactivity and strain from their parents than they did when they were young children. Age 35 is also a\ntypical time for people to start exercising less frequently and less strenuously and to begin losing muscle\nmass and muscle tone. Finally, age 35 is a typical time for a person to settle into a more sedentary job.\nFigure 8 depicts this loading profile that I have just explained; it is constant, gradually decreasing, and\nthen again constant.\nFigure 8: Variable skeletal loading profile resulting in 30% reduction by age 60\nAs stated in the problem, it is assumed that any reduction in skeletal loading is linearly related to a\nreduction in femoral shaft section modulus. Consequently, the gradual decrease from 100% to 70%\nloading corresponds to a gradual decrease from 100% to 70% of a person's initial section modulus. The\npicture of the percent change in section modulus over time is identical to the picture of skeletal loading\nover time.\nThis gradual reduction in skeletal loading has the effect of preventing the increase in the outer radius\nand consequently speeding up the decrease of BMD. The inner femoral radius continues to increase at\nthe same 0.004 cm/year rate. Physically, this model predicts that remodeling continues to absorb bone\nfrom the inner cortical surface, but modeling ceases to add bone to the outer surface. The reduction in\nskeletal loading means that the bone has no reason to adapt to maintain a constant section modulus.\nSince the section modulus can be allowed to decrease, the outer radius does not have to be built upon.\nFigures 9 and 10 show how the outer radius remains almost constant while the inner radius increases\n\nSolutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\nlinearly (as before) and the BMD decreases by as much as 40%. During the years from age 35 to 60,\nwhile the skeletal loading is decreasing gradually, the rate of change of BMD is faster than during the\nyears while the skeletal loading is constant.\nFigure 9: Percent changes in female BMD and cortical radii, subject to reductions in skeletal loading\nFigure 10: Percent changes in male BMD and cortical radii, subject to reductions in skeletal loading\n\nSolutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\nSummary of loading and remodeling effects:\nTo understand better the profound effect on the femur caused by a reduction in skeletal loading , I\ncreated a summary table to compare the results of the different skeletal loading and bone remodeling\nscenarios.\nvariable loading\n/\n)\n)\n)\nle\nLi\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nle\nLi\n-\nTable 1: Summary of changes in outer radius, inner radius, and BMD, for constant and\nGender\nLoading\nprofile\nRemodeling\nrate\n(cm year\nAge 80\nouter\nradius\n(cm\nOuter\nradius %\nchange\nfrom 25 to\n80 yrs\nAge 80\ninner\nradius\n(cm\nInner radius\n% change\nfrom 25 to\n80 years\nAge 80\nBMD\nBMD %\nchange\nfrom 25\nto 80\nyears\nConstant\n0.004\n1.49\n6.4\n1.12\n1.08\n-20\nConstant\n0.008\n1.62\n1.34\n0.85\n-37\nConstant\n0.016\n1.95\n1.78\n0.53\n-61\nFema\nnear 30%\ndecrease\nbetween\nages 35\nand 60\n0.004\n1.39\n0.4\n1.12\n1.25\nConstant\n0.004\n1.81\n6.5\n1.42\n1.15\nConstant\n0.008\n1.95\n1.64\n0.94\nConstant\n0.016\n2.28\n2.08\n0.64\nMa\nnear 30%\ndecrease\nbetween\nages 35\nand 60\n0.004\n1.71\n0.3\n1.42\n0.87\nThe summary table shows clearly that of the scenarios modeled, the largest values for percent change in\nBMD occur for a remodeling rate of 0.016 cm/year (the quadrupled rate). For this same remodeling\nrate, however, the values for percent change in outer radius are also at their largest. Consequently, bone\nstrength is not necessarily reduced; losses in BMD are compensated for by gains in bone width.\nHowever, the summary table also shows a scenario where bone strength likely is reduced. For the case\nwhen skeletal loading decreases with age, the percent change in BMD is about the same as in the\ndoubled remodeling rate case, but there is no large increase in shaft outer radius to compensate for the\nloss in BMD. In the female case of decreasing skeletal loading, BMD decreases by 39% over the course\nof 55 years, and the outer radius actually decreases by 0.4%. This result of our simple model has serious\nimplications for human spaceflight. When we model a load reduction of just 30%, we see the possibility\nfor a severe reduction in bone strength. During spaceflight, however, loading is not simply reduced;\nrather, it is completely eliminated; there is zero skeletal loading in microgravity (with the exception of\nexercise countermeasures).\n\nSolutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\nMATLAB Code\n%Find outer radius as a cunction of changing inner radius\n%assuming constant skeletal loading and consequently constant\n%section modulus Z\nro_init = 1.70; %cm, for males\n%ro_init = 1.40; %cm, for females\nri_init = 1.20; %cm, for males\n%ri_init = 0.90; %cm, for females\nri_rate = 4*0.004; %cm/year\nrho = 1.05; %g/cm^3, solid bone density\nZ = 0.25*pi*(ro_init^4 - ri_init^4)/ro_init;\n%section modulus\nbone_results = zeros(70,7);\n%matrix to hold results for each year\nro = ro_init;\n%initialize outer radius\nfor t = 1:70,\nbone_results(t,1) = t + 25;\n%age in years\nro_side = 0.25*pi*ro^4 - Z*ro;\n%one side of equation for Z\nri = ri_init + ri_rate*t;\nri_side = 0.25*pi*ri^4;\n%other side of equation for Z\nwhile (ro_side <= ri_side),\nro = ro + 0.00005;\n%make tiny increment in ro if one\nro_side = 0.25*pi*ro^4 - Z*ro; %side of equation is less than\nend\n%other\narea = pi*(ro^2 - ri^2);\n%once the two sides converge,\nBMD = area*rho/(2*ro);\n%store results for this t\nbone_results(t,2) = ro;\n%in matrix\nbone_results(t,3) = ri;\nbone_results(t,4) = ro_side;\nbone_results(t,5) = ri_side;\nbone_results(t,6) = area;\nbone_results(t,7) = BMD;\nt = t + 1;\n%move on to the next year\nend\n\nSolutions by Kristen Bethke\nMarch 2, 2006\n16.423J\n%Find outer radius as a cunction of changing inner radius\n%assuming variable skeletal loading and consequently variable\n%section modulus Z\n%ro_init = 1.70; %cm, for males\nro_init = 1.40; %cm, for females\n%ri_init = 1.20; %cm, for males\nri_init = 0.90; %cm, for females\nri_rate = 0.004; %cm/year\nrho = 1.05; %g/cm^3, solid bone density\nZ_init = 0.25*pi*(ro_init^4 - ri_init^4)/ro_init;\n%section modulus\nZ = Z_init;\nbone_results = zeros(70,8);\n%matrix to hold results for each year\nro = ro_init;\n%initialize outer radius\nfor t = 1:70,\nbone_results(t,1) = t + 25;\n%age in years\nif t >= 10,\n%corresponds to age 35\nif t <= 35,\n%corresponds to age 60\nZ = Z_init*(-0.0120*(t-10)+1);\n%decreased loading ---> decreased Z\n%this expression for changing Z will cause it\n%decrease by 30% over 25 years\nend\nend\nro_side = 0.25*pi*ro^4 - Z*ro;\n%one side of equation for Z\nri = ri_init + ri_rate*t;\nri_side = 0.25*pi*ri^4;\n%other side of equation for Z\nwhile (ro_side <= ri_side),\nro = ro + 0.00005;\nro_side = 0.25*pi*ro^4 - Z*ro;\nend\nif (ro_side >= ri_side+0.004),\nro = ro - 0.02;\n%make tiny increment in ro if one\nro_side = 0.25*pi*ro^4 - Z*ro; %side is less than other\nwhile (ro_side <= ri_side),\nro = ro + 0.00005;\nro_side = 0.25*pi*ro^4 - Z*ro;\nend\nend\narea = pi*(ro^2 - ri^2);\n%once the two sides converge,\nBMD = area*rho/(2*ro);\n%store results for this t\nbone_results(t,2) = ro;\n%in matrix\nbone_results(t,3) = ri;\nbone_results(t,4) = ro_side;\nbone_results(t,5) = ri_side;\nbone_results(t,6) = area;\nbone_results(t,7) = BMD;\nbone_results(t,8) = Z;\nt = t + 1;\n%move on to the next year\nend"

You have, at your disposal, an air-bearing floor that simulates\nmicrogravity in one plane. You wish to model the motion of the astronauts on the floor\nwhile they perform push-offs and landings so that you can develop theories about their\nadaptation that can aid in training. What are the primary equations that govern this kind\nof situation? What effects are you modeling? What effects are you leaving out? If you\nknow all of the dynamics going on, is it always a good idea to model them all? When\nmight it not be a good idea?

Gordon Cooper to\nspace for a U.S. record-breaking 34 hours. While his health prior and during flight was\nexcellent, egress from the space capsule imposed a substantial burden on his\ncardiovascular system:\n\n\"The postflight examination began prior to egress from the spacecraft. Approximately 40\nminutes after landing, two measurements of the astronaut's [Cooper's] blood pressure\nwere recorded while he was still lying in the spacecraft on the deck of the recovery ship.\nHe was then able to egress from the spacecraft without assistance and stand erect on the\ndeck while his blood pressure was again recorded on the onboard tape. Later\nexamination of this 3 1/2 minute record shows that, while he was still in the spacecraft,\nhis blood pressures were 101/65 and 105/87, with a corresponding heart rate of 132 beats\nper minute. During egress and immediately thereafter, while standing upright on the\ndeck, his heart rate rose to 188 beats per minute [...]. At that point, another blood\npressure recording was attempted and, although the apparatus appeared to cycle\nnormally, no pressure pulses were seen on the recording.\n\nHis heart then returned to a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 92 beats per minute at\nsensor disconnect.\n\nAfter standing on the deck for approximately a minute, the pilot began to look pale and,\nalthough his face was already wet, new beads of perspiration appeared on his forehead.\nHe swayed slightly and reported symptoms of impending loss of consciousness including\nlightheadedness, dimming of vision, and tingling of his feet and legs. The cable was\nimmediately disconnected and, with support at each arm, he began to walk away from the\nspacecraft.

(25 points) Exploration in Extreme Environments.\n1a. Your best friend has been selected as an astronaut candidate, what advice (or \"lessons\nlearned\") would you give him/her as he/she embarks on a 12-week (3 month) analog\nmission to the South Pole in Antarctica? He/she will be living with 5 other crewmates (3\nwomen and 3 men total) (15 points).\nPlease provide a one-paragraph answer that synthesizes your advice.\nSolutions could include:\n- Isolated Confined Environments (top 7 categories to be aware of include):\no Overall hypothesis: Space is an extreme environment where lessons from\nextreme environments on Earth can be useful.\no Group interaction (overwhelmingly the most behavioral issue, cooperate, put\nthe team first, unanticipated dynamics, positive outlook and attitude, team\ngoals, how about testing the group before the mission?), communications (can\nhave positive or negative effect, external, internal, mission control), workload\n(strike a balance, busy and challenging work, not bored), recreation/leisure\ntime (has a positive effect), medical support (limited resources), adjustment,\nleadership (significantly effects mission success, authority and delegation,\nhow about testing the leaders and managers before the mission who are\nresponsible for making many decisions?), and food (can have a very positive\neffect)\no Other important issues include: single/significant events (do not focus on a\nsingle activity), organization/management, equipment (use adequately tested\nequipment), sleep and safety\no 3rd quarter slump in performance is a known phenomena (anticipate), Stuster's\nstudy shows physician 3rd quarter slump and leaders' experiencing the greatest\ndecline in the 2nd quarter.\no Group interaction themes to watch out for: interpersonal conflicts, not fitting\nin, problems in crew changes, trivial issues exaggerated, withdrawal; positive\nresponses are seen in celebrations (among crew), balancing team/individual\nwork, group discussions, etc.\no Knowing your \"mission\" includes familiarization with: environment (know\nyour environment and be familiar with the effect it has on you, and use it to\nyour advantage), past missions (learn from history), successful outcomes,\npreparing before the mission (social, communication, expectations, etc.).\nWhen in trouble, try lateral thinking. Learn to make errors and learn from\nthem.\n1b. Please briefly describe an 'informal' human performance experiment that you would\nrecommend to your colleague to run during his/her Antarctic experience (10 points).\n\nProf. Newman\nQuiz 1\n16.423J/HST515J/ESD65J\n- Choose your own experiment. Example measurements include: subjective\n(questionnaires), qualitative (journals) and quantitative measurements (physical\nperformance). Suggest an experimental hypothesis, state the objective, and\nanticipated results.\n2. (40 points) Describe the skeletal physiological adaptive changes when exposed to long-\nterm microgravity. Include current scientific hypotheses, results,\nsimilarities/differences to aging, comparison to 1G)? {illustrations and/or models are\nencouraged in this answer}\nSolutions might include the following:\nFor bone, the signal to demineralize seems to be linked to stress presented by activity of the\nantigravity muscles, so when posture is no longer the same, muscles are not used, and bone\nstruts no longer needed.\n- decrease in osteoblast function and osteoclast function remains the same\n- bone connected to force bearing muscle seems to be most affected, i.e. hips, pelvis,\nvertebrae (illustrate or reference Russian figure below).\n- bone demineralization and remodeling, decrease in bone formation etiology: skeletal\nunloading or because trabecular bone is metabolically more active\n- possibility of irreversible changes (need longitudinal database on\nastronauts/cosmonauts)\nAdaptive modeling, or Wolf's Law (which follows Frost's Mechanostat in the materials),\ndescribes a relationship between bone structure and function. Throughout life, bone is\nconstantly broken down and rebuilt to accommodate changing mechanical demands on the\nskeleton. From an engineering perspective, reduced bone strength could occur for two\nreasons: 1. The material is less able to withstand loading stresses OR 2. The structure is\naltered to increase loading stresses. Stress and strain must be major players in this evolving\nstory. If we think geometrically, bone density (BMD) does not measure strength, rather,\nstrength is determined by shape and dimensions of bone cross-sections. The homeostatic\n\nProf. Newman\nQuiz 1\n16.423J/HST515J/ESD65J\nendpoint that the body strives to maintain appears to be the section modulus. Ah ha, we\nmight hypothesize that strain magnitude (and frequency) are the stimuli for bone\nresportion and formation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that stress and particularly,\nbending might be essential to understand the mechanisms of bone loss in space. Buckling\nmight really need to be understood for bone fractures in the elderly. We need a model. Why?\nOur measured properties do not uncover the essential mechanisms. We now discuss the\nrelation to aging. A young bone is shown on the left with an elderly schematic in the center\nand right where the endiosteal (inner diameter) expands (loss) as well as trabecular bone loss\nand there is appropriate adaptive periosteal (outer diameter) bone formation. The bottom\nline result in aging is that there is BMD loss, but not necessarily section modulus reduction,\ntherefore strength can be maintained. We become more mechanically efficient as we age\n(nice human design!). If we go into microgravity and reduce\ni\nill\nlt i\n)\nresu\nn: 1 acce\nloading,\nIn the Figures, we hypothesize that the lack of load ng w\nlerated\ninternal bone loss, 2) no periosteal expansion, and that both BMD and bone strength\nwould be reduced (See below). The cosmonaut data lends credit to our hypothesis.\nIn conclusion, depending on skeletal loading, geometric changes may compensate for net\nbone loss. Reduced skeletal loading is a form of disuse like spaceflight. Bone loss in disuse\nleads to reduced structural strength. Wolff is still right today! Limitations to our studies\ninclude: Structural geometry can be measured with current DXA scanners but they don't do\nit very well. Small changes in dimensions are structurally relevant, but can't be reliably\nmeasured with current DXA scanners. We are able to show significant changes but we do it\nwith statistical power (large change (spaceflight) or large N (elderly or NHANES studies).\n3. (25 points) Give short, but complete definitions of the following:\n(a) the size principle;\n(b) nuclear chain and nuclear bag fibers;\n(c) illustrate α-γ coactivation (use a sketch with labels and some narrative);\n(d) describe how muscle fiber types might adapt in long-duration spaceflight;\n(e) Will the L-T (length-tension) and F-V (force-velocity) curves be affected by spaceflight?\nHow?\n\nProf. Newman\nQuiz 1\n16.423J/HST515J/ESD65J\nSolutions (detailed descriptions included for completeness, but not in Quiz answer)\na. Size Principle - states that the motor units that generate the smallest forces are activated\nfirst. The largest motor units, with the greatest number of muscle fibers, originate in the\nlargest nerve cell bodies and require the greatest amplitude of stimulus before becoming\nactive. (Henneman et al., 1965) The small motor units - mostly supply red muscle fiber w/\nhigh density of mitochondria are highly fatigue resistant on always \"on\". The large motor\nunits supply most white or pink muscle fibers and are capable of high velocities and high\nforces for short periods. Nice symmetry here - motor units are recruited from small to large,\nthe increment in forces as the new one comes in is always proportional to the level of force at\nthe time. The sequence is reversed when the force level falls (largest units dropping out\nfirst).\nb-c. Within that motor unit are muscle spindles\n(stretch receptors) subject to the same relative\nstretch as the whole muscle. The muscle\nspindle is made up of nuclear bag and\nnuclear chain fibers. Golgi tendon organs,\nsensitive to tendon stretch, are usually found\nnear the muscle-tendon junction. Nuclear bag\n(~ 2) and nuclear chain (~ 3-5 per spindle = 2-3\nmm long, 1.5 mm in diameter). Small muscles\nfor fine control hive a high density of spindles\n(some hand muscles w/ 120 spindles per gram\nof muscle) vs. Large muscles, gastroc., fewer\nthan 5 spindles per gram. The spindle functions\ninclude position and rate of change of length\nsignaling. Alpha (α) motoneurons inervate\nthe main muscle mass (extrafusal fibers)\nwhile, gamma (γ ) motoneurons inervate the\ninterafusal fibers within the spindle organs.\nSpindles attach at both ends to the main\nmuscles and act as strain guages. The gammas\nare much smaller and have slower conduction\nvelocities than alpha motoneurons. Muscle\nspindle afferents are of 2 types: Ia and II. The\nIa come from the nuclear bag fibers\n(possibly the chains) and the II come from\nthe nuclear chain fibers. The nuclear bag is\nassociated with gamma dynamic (γ d) and gamma static (γ s) efferents with both bag and\nchains, therefore, built-in velocity and length sensors, respectively. Small muscles for\nfine control have many spindles compared to large muscles that may have few spindles.\nGroup I fibers have large axons and therefore high conduction velocities. Group II fibers are\nsmaller with lower conduction velocities.\n\nProf. Newman\nQuiz 1\n16.423J/HST515J/ESD65J\nMuscle commands are signaled by simultaneous increases in both α and γ activity by higher\norder motor centers. This alleviates the problem of contraction of the main (extrafusal)\nmuscle mass and a slackening of the spindles if only a motor activity changed (say\nincreased). The stretch reflex would then come into play as the Ia afferent activity dropped,\ncausing the a motor activity to fall, thus turning the muscle force off. α-γ coactivation\nalleviates this problem. Needle electrodes in the intrafusal and extrafusal muscle fibers of the\nhand show that an increase in discharges from the spindle afferents occurs at the same time\nor only slightly after the beginning of electrical activity in the extrafusal muscle. The slight\ndelay is accounted for by the time required for the intrafusal fibers to contract. (Additional\nanswer covered in Muscle Homework Solutions)\nd. Long-duration spaceflight shows selective atrophy of the slow twitch muscle fibers (SO,\nor 'red'), of the antigravity muscles. Extensor muscles have the majority of slow fibers\ntypes and these are the primary antigravity muscle, therefore, they are most affected.\nSignificant atrophy of both fiber types can be seen in spaceflight, and the extent of atrophy is\nconfounded by the level of countermeasures (exercise). There is less need (and therefore use)\nof the fast fibers (FG, or 'white') during spaceflight 'locomotion' in microgravity and there\nis a shift toward slow fibers. FG (fast glycolytic), white fibers (palest staining, look for\npresence of mitochondrial ATPase in stains); fastest=time required for the tension to rise to\nits peak value in a twitch is less than other types, low density of mitochondria and blood\ncapillaries, anaerobic glycolysis to resynthesize muscle phosphagens. Fast oxidative\nglycolytic (FOG, or pink fibers), intermediate size between white and red, similar to FG, but\nmore mitochondria, oxidative enzymes present, partially aerobic. Slow oxidative, or red\nmuscle fibers are the smallest axon diameter fibers, which require the lowest tetanic tension\nof activation, slow contraction velocity, rich in mitochondria (red blood cell) concentration\nand oxygen carrying capacity, high oxidative enzymes, aerobic processes, fatigue resistant.\ne. The L-T (length-tension) relationship is based on Huxley's physiological quantitative\nmodel of the actin-myosin crossbridges, so we don't expect a change in the relative sense T\n(%) vs. Length, (Note: assuming no cellular structural changes.), BUT if you plot L-T on an\nabsolute scale you will notice reduced Tension levels from the loss of strength and atrophy (I\nimagine most will give this answer). Hill's F-V (force-velocity) curve will be affected by\nspaceflight. From class lectures, notes and the Russian muscle data a considerable decrease\nwas noted in the F/V ratio during spaceflight. As measured by a dynomometer, you expect\nthe force to have a higher slope (steeper dropoff) giving less force per velocity for\nshortening. Thus, the power curve (T &V) will also be decreased. You might need to take\n\nProf. Newman\nQuiz 1\n16.423J/HST515J/ESD65J\nthis in to consideration for the design of a lunar or Martian bicycle! You can think of the 3D\nrelationship between Tension-Length-Velocity to capture the changes all at once:\n4. (10 Points) Realizing the unified physiology of the musculoskeletal system, comment and/or\nillustrate how your answers for questions 2 and 3 above interact in a systems sense.\nMusculoskeletal system: The muscles and bones are connected via tendons and stress,\nstrain and force are critical parameters for performance. Consider the interaction of the\nmuscles and bones, particularly in the most significant regions (i.e., the vertebrae, long\nbones, hip). In bone, the imparted stress signals bone formation, resorption, and steady-state\nhomeostasis. Bone demineralization seems to be linked to stress presented by external\nloading and to musculature. The activity of muscles is greatly reduced when posture control\nis no longer the same (or no longer needed in spaceflight), therefore, altering the stress-strain\nprofile. This phenomena gives rise to the result above (slow twitch fibers atrophy more,\nespecially the extensor muscles since they have the majority of slow fibers types and these\nare the primary antigravity muscles). The stress-strain musculoskeletal response is critical,\nespecially subjected to bending moments and torsion. Frost's mechanostat theory suggests\nthat bone maintains a certain strain level. The system witnesses a decrease from the\nmusculature and, therefore, reduced strain on the skeleton, which results in an exacerbated\nphysiological deconditioning of the musculoskeletal system. There is an integrated\nphysiological effect going on dependent on gravity as well as each other (musculo-skeletal\ndependence).\nPhysiological deconditioning from spaceflight manifests itself as the need for an adaptive\nresponse to 1G upon return from spaceflight. CNS recruitment of muscle fibers necessary for\nmovement in 1G for musculoskeletal performance and motor control. The need in 1G to\nmaintain upright posture has to account for altered posture etiology: atrophy due to a\ndecrease in CNS recruitment of antigravity muscles and perhaps a concomitant decrease in\nthe contractile proteins synthesized in muscle. You also have an instantaneous skeletal\nloading in 1G that requires an adaptive response, not to mention orthostatic intolerance.1\n1 In general, the illustrations provided were much appreciated and demonstrated your learning."

      "content": "Summary Notes on Muscle Motor Units\nSize Principle [McMahon, 1984 and before him Henneman]\nLarge motor units require the greatest amplitude of stimulus to become active. The\nsmallest and most excitable neurons are turned on at a low level of stimulus strength,\nwith the consequence that the muscle force may be finely tuned at low levels through\nsmall adjustments in the number of muscle fibers active. The larger motor units come in\nonly at high levels of force.\nDark Meat or White?

In shortening, the relationship between the Force and Velocity is (Hill's Curve - know\nthis!!):\n(T+a)(v+b) = (To+a)b Hyperbolic Form\n-\nMuscles shorten more rapidly against light loads than they do against heavy ones\n-\nMuscles which are actively shortening can produce less force than those which\ncontract isometrically.\n\n2. There is a discontinuity in the slope of F-V curve at zero velocity.\n3. Active muscle yields when the load exceeds about 1.8 To (To - Tetanus tension).\n4. Hill's observations of the Fenn effect give a linear relation between total rate of energy\nliberation and tension.\nFenn = muscle produces a certain extra heat when it shortens a given distance, whether\nshortening velocity is fast or slow.\n5. Muscle shortening should be based on the relative motion of sliding filaments because:\n-\nA-band width stays constant during stretch and shortening\n-\nA-band disappears when myosin is dissolved away\n-\nActin filaments begin at Z-line, run through I-bands into A-band, but stop before\nreaching H-zone (muscle at rest length), I-band is entirely actin filaments, H-zone\nis myosin filaments\n6. Muscular energy liberation should be based on the splitting of a high-energy phosphate\nas actomyosin attachments separate.\nMuscle Graphics (still needs development, any takers?)\nImage, In action, Detail, In action, X-ray image, Muscle movie\nMuscle Tension-Length properties\nHill's Force-Velocity relationship"

Length, velocity and bursts:\nEverybody agrees that spindles give information about not only its length, but also about its rate\nof change of length. (T. McMahon pg. 153-154)\n\"Primary endings of muscle spindle are highly sensitive to the rate of change of muscle length, a\nproperty referred to as velocity sensitivity.\"\n\"Because of their high degree of dynamic sensitivity, primary endings respond with bursts of\nfiring to transient stimuli.\" (C.

The meeting\nwas the brainchild of Keith Cowing and astronaut John Grunsfeld, NASA's chief scientist at\nthe time. Its goals, stated in the letter of invitation published herein, were precipitated by\nthe ongoing dialogue on risk and exploration in the wake of the Columbia Shuttle accident,\nthe Hubble Space Telescope servicing question, and, in a broader sense, by the many NASA\nprograms that inevitably involve a balance between risk and forward-looking exploration.\nThe meeting, extraordinarily broad in scope and participant experience, offers insights\non why we explore, how to balance risk and exploration, how different groups define and\nperceive risk differently, and the importance of exploration to a creative society.\nAt NASA Headquarters, Bob Jacobs, Trish Pengra, and Joanna Adamus of NASA Public\nAffairs led the meeting's implementation. At NASA's Ames Research Center, Director\nScott Hubbard coordinated a group including Rho Christensen, Danny Thompson, Shirley\nBerthold, Victoria Steiner, Ed Schilling, Mike Mewhinney, Kathleen Burton, and the Ames\nVideo Team. Mel Averner also contributed significantly to the concept and content. The\nNaval Postgraduate School, commanded by Rear Admiral Patrick W. Dunne, provided a\ncongenial venue.\nThe meeting was broadcast on NASA TV, and thanks are due in this regard to Al\nFeinberg, Tony Stewart, Jim Taylor, and the planners' collaborative: Mark Shaddock and\nSpotlight Productions, Donovan Gates of Donovan Gates Production, and Michael Ditertay\nand his staff on this 30-person television crew. Thanks to their efforts, a DVD record of the\nmeeting has also been produced.\nThanks are also due to the moderators: Miles O'Brien of CNN, Chris McKay of NASA\nAmes, David Halpern of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and John\nGrunsfeld, NASA Headquarters.\nFinally, thanks are due in the NASA History Division to Liz Suckow and Steve Garber,\nand to the staff in the Printing and Design Office at NASA Headquarters: Shelley Kilmer, Cathy\nWilson, Paula Kephart, Henry Spencer, Jeffrey McLean, Greg Treese, and Steve Johnson.\nIn order to maintain the informal flavor of the meetings, these proceedings are based\non transcripts that have been lightly edited for grammar and punctuation.

Cowing, Editor, NASAWatch.com\nvii\n\nInvitation Letter\nThe goal of the Risk and Exploration Symposium is to engage in an open discussion about the\nissue of risk--identifying it, mitigating it, accepting it--all in the course of exploration. Yes,\nrisk taking is inherently failure-prone. Otherwise, it would be called \"sure-thing-taking.\"\nChallenge fosters excellence, often drawing on previously untapped skills and abilities.\nEach of us takes and accepts risk as a part of our daily existence. We often go out of our way\nto seek challenge. However, seeking challenge often means accepting a high level of risk.\nThe dictionary defines risk as being exposed to hazard or danger. To accept risk is to accept\npossible loss or injury, even death.\nOne of the key issues that continues to be debated in the tragedy of the Space Shuttle\nColumbia is the level of risk NASA accepted. And, ultimately, the entire nation is now\nengaged in a broader debate over whether or not the exploration of space is worth the risk\nof human life.\nWhile risk can often be reduced or controlled, there comes a point when the removal\nof all risk is either impossible or so impractical that it completely undermines the very\nnature of what NASA was created to do--to pioneer the future.\nEveryone today understands that human space exploration is a risky endeavor.\nHowever, the quest for discovery and knowledge, and the risks involved in overcoming\nseemingly insurmountable obstacles is not unique to NASA. Whether the challenge is\nexploring the depths of our oceans or reaching the top of our highest mountains, great\nfeats usually involve great risk.\nDuring this symposium, we want to examine the similarities between space\nexploration and other terrestrial expeditions, and examine how society accepts risk. For\nexample, more than 40,000 Americans die each year in automobile accidents. A recent\nstudy of 22,000 fatal accidents showed that nearly two-thirds of the victims were not\nwearing seatbelts--a clear indication that too many of us fail to understand the risks when\nwe get behind the wheel of a car and fail to buckle up.\nWhy are sacrifices made in the name of exploration more notable than the losses\nsuffered in the course of everyday life? What lessons can be learned by studying the history\nof exploration and risk? And why are so many people willing to risk their lives to advance\nadventure, discovery, and science when, often, the benefits are unknown and indefinable?\nWe have assembled an invitation-only audience of participants for this important\nevent comprised of NASA astronauts and leaders, as well as world renowned mountain\nclimbers, deep sea explorers, cave explorers, Arctic and Antarctic researchers, scientists,\ncommunication experts, and others. These participants are involved, in a personal way,\nwith risky endeavors, which serve to expand the frontiers of human knowledge beneath the\nsea, on the surface of Earth, and in outer space.\nWe look forward to your participation in what we believe will be a spirited and highly\nbeneficial public discussion of risk and exploration.\nSean O'Keefe, NASA Administrator\nix\n\nIntroduction\nOn behalf of Ames Research Center, one of your local hosts, I bid you greetings: to the\nAdministrator, to my fellow Center Directors, distinguished guests from Headquarters,\nmembers of the NASA family. Our thoughts go out today to members of the Kennedy Space\nCenter who cannot be here with us. They are attending to the damage from the hurricanes\nthat have hit them recently. Greetings also to the rest of the distinguished guests here, and,\nof course, to our gracious hosts at the Naval Postgraduate School.\nWe are here today to look at risk. How do we perceive risk, real and otherwise? How\ndo we identify risk? How do we mitigate risk? And finally, when and how should we tolerate\nand accept risk? And all of this discussion, of course, is in the context of exploration, the\nessence of what we do.\nWhat is risk? In our daily lives, we all assume multiple levels of real risk. We get\ninto cars. We get into airplanes, some of us far too often. We cross roads. We use cell\nphones while we're driving. We eat bacon and barbecued chicken that contain potentially\ncarcinogenic nitrites. One way or another, all these things represent real risks that we\ntolerate and accept. Most of us mitigate these risks in some measure by doing things like\nwearing seatbelts, using the oversight of agencies like the FAA, remembering to look both\nways, and getting our annual physical checkups. We are accustomed to living with risk,\nwhether we realize it or not.\nToday, tomorrow, and Wednesday morning, we are going to explore risk in the field\nof exploration. There is monetary risk, programmatic risk, and, of course, the far more\ncompelling issue of risk to life and limb of the explorers. We look at how we decide what\nrisks are acceptable, both for the individual and the institution. I think this is a key element\nhere. How do people perceive risk individually? How do we perceive risk as institutions?\nHow do we collectively decide what we will accept?\nLet me give you a little bit of insight from my own experiences. I will start with a\nprogram from seven or eight years ago where I was fortunate to be the manager of the Lunar\nProspector mission. In December 1997, just days before the launch, we had to make some\nvery tough assessments of the risk. There was a single-string spacecraft, first use of a new\nlaunchpad, the maiden flight of a new launch vehicle, although it was a design based on\nsome proven fleet ballistic missile motors. There was a very tight budget schedule, and a\nrelatively young team, although with some key experienced people at the top. So, why did\nwe go for launch? Why did we accept that risk?\nWell, we had a strong test program, solid teaming with effective communication and\nsome very experienced key managers, open channels during the design and development\nprocess, and lots of insight from a \"graybeard\" committee that provided us with truly\neffective comments. In the end, the deciding factors amounted to a considerable degree\nof trust and the determination that we had done everything possible to ensure mission\nsuccess. So, we launched. That mission was successful, and that data is now being used as\nwe plan a return to the Moon in the not-too-distant future.\nAnother example is from the restructuring of the Mars program. In April and June\n2000, we had to decide whether to take the risk of going back to Mars for an opportunity\n\nthat was just 38 months away. Would we not only send an orbiter, but would we send a\nlander? We had three opportunities there: do nothing, send an orbiter, and send a lander.\nWhy did we take the risk of doing the most ambitious one?\nWell, it was an outstanding launch opportunity. We had solid heritage from the\nPathfinder Mission. We had a fully developed payload, and we had a robust entry, descent\nand landing scheme that was well understood. We put two rovers into the mission to balance\nthe risk against random failures, and I think, as you will hear later on in this meeting from\nSteve Squyres, having 2 rovers had an unanticipated benefit of providing a rich panoply of\nhardware from which to reduce other types of risks. But, in the end, the reason we took that\nrisk was because it was the right thing to do. A strategic plan brought us back to the surface\nof Mars and gained the kind of information that is now changing the textbooks, changing\nthe way that we look at the Red Planet.\nFinally, let's look at the issue of human spaceflight risk. I was honored to be the sole\nNASA representative on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. It was one of the most\ndifficult assignments that I have ever had in my career. In that entire seven months, we never\nlost sight once of the nine lives that were lost, the seven astronauts and the two searchers,\nthe two helicopter pilots. Clearly, we take substantial risk when we put humans on the top\nof a rocket and leave Earth's gravity well. How do we adequately mitigate that risk? From\nColumbia, we learned some tough lessons. We learned we need to develop a culture of safety\nfor the long haul. We need clear communication, clear organization, adequate resources,\nrigorous and sound engineering principles, and a program systems engineering approach\nthat addresses the entire effort, that addresses all the analysis that we need.\nWe also need to effectively learn to encourage alternative points of view. If we do all\nof these things, can we eliminate risk, especially for human spaceflight? I think not. Will we\nfind a balance of well-mitigated risk and a powerful level of acceptable risk? I, for one, think\nso. What will that balance be? That's what we have come together to discuss today.\nScott Hubbard, Director, NASA Ames Research Center\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\nOpen next section\n\nThe Vision for Space Exploration\nThere is no historic analogue, I think, to a gathering like this.\nCertainly, no records exist of people living in Lisbon 500 years ago attending a candlelight\nsymposium featuring Amerigo Vespucci or Vasco da Gama or Ferdinand Magellan. So, this is\nan opportunity given by modern technology and the ease of transportation to pull together\nthis really extraordinary group of folks who've experienced the full extent and breadth\nof exploration and the risks attendant thereto. Such a gathering was important for the\npurpose of parsing this larger question of risk and return on the exploration ventures we are\nabout. I am particularly grateful to John Grunsfeld, who has really provided the intellectual\nhorsepower behind this kind of effort to think about these questions in a structured way,\nand to Keith Cowing, two very disparate kinds of folks, but folks who share the passion and\ndesire for exploration and an understanding of the attendant risk to it. So, to Keith and to\nJohn, I am most grateful for that extraordinary nudge that you all provided in pulling this\ntogether and providing the structure of the meeting.\nWe are gathered here, appropriately, in a place like Monterey, at the edge of a great\nocean, to discuss exploration in all of it facets of extreme environments here on Earth and\nin space. Indeed, this historic location is steeped in a history of exploration. The ventures of\nini\nSean O'Keefe\nNASA Adm\nstrator, 2001-05\nSean O'Keefe was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as NASA's 10th administrator. He\nserved from 21 December 2001 to 19 February 2005. During his term, O'Keefe actively supported NASA's\nmany missions to advance exploration and discovery in aeronautics and space technologies.\nO'Keefe joined the Bush Administration on inauguration day and first served as the Deputy Director of\nthe Office of Management and Budget until December 2001. Prior to joining the Bush Administration,\nO'Keefe was the Louis A. Bantle Professor of Business and Government Policy, an endowed chair at\nthe Syracuse University Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. Appointed as the Secretary\nof the Navy in July 1992 by President George Bush, O'Keefe previously served as Comptroller and\nChief Financial Officer of the Department of Defense from 1989. Before joining then Defense Secretary\nDick Cheney's Pentagon management team in these capacities, he served on the United States Senate\nCommittee on Appropriations staff for eight years, and was Staff Director of the Defense Appropriations\nSubcommittee. His public service began in 1978 upon selection as a Presidential Management Intern.\n\nso many people to explore and to establish the site of civilization that we see in\nthis marvelous area here around Monterey is testimonial to that. What we enjoy\neach day in this community, and understand about exploration and its benefits,\nare here and evident each day. Certainly this evening we will have an opportunity\nto see that more specifically at the aquarium.\nI want to provoke some thought and reflection about a central question\nwhich we're discussing here in these two and a half days. Why do we take\nsuch risks to explore? As humans, what is it about us that really wants to\nunderstand that which is on the other side of the horizon, that which is on the\nother side of the ridge? In doing so, there are periods of our human history in\nwhich the acceptance of those risks have resulted in great gains and, in other\ncases a mere footnote, because it ended in a way that was less than fulfilling.\nIn each case, there was always a contribution to that human desire to want to\nknow and understand. How we assess those risks and deal with the challenges\nof exploration is the central question we are about in this two and a half days,\nand I am most grateful to all of you for accepting the invitation to participate\nin this kind of debate and discussion of how we may structure this question,\nnot only in a public but also in a specific way. I am certain we will have a lively\ndiscussion of where you draw the line between the benefits of exploration and\nthe inherent risks, especially as technology changes, and as we learn more about\nthe environments in which we explore.\nNow, this is in part about NASA participation, to be sure, but it is mostly\nabout those of us from NASA having the opportunity to learn from so many\nothers who are engaged in the broader exploration agenda of the central questions\nwe pose.\nI am most grateful to see the Apollo, Shuttle, and Space Station veterans\nwho have gathered here with us to share their thoughts. Indeed, I think it will be\nhistoric in and of itself to learn so much from them. All of them have dared to sit\nin a spaceship at one point (and in several cases, like Jerry Ross, seven different\ntimes), to sit on the top of the spaceship with millions of pounds of explosive\nfuel, prepared to put their lives on the line in order to advance that cause of\nexploration and discovery. Now I asked Jerry, why you do this, and he said, \"Well,\nbecause it's an opportunity to do so,\" and he would easily sign up for an eighth\nflight this afternoon, I'm sure. As a matter of fact, I don't think he would wait\nuntil noon to sign up for an opportunity.\nTo some, it may seem that NASA has made space travel routine. Let there\nbe no mistake: I think we all fully appreciate and understand that space flight\nand exploration is still a very risky proposition. Despite our efforts to eliminate\nthat risk, there will always be an attendant risk to such a venture. And, as a\nresult, here in attendance are NASA scientists, engineers, and managers whose\njob it is to have constant vigilance about that risk. And in that regard, I view\nmyself as included in that requirement for constant diligence to assure that risk\nis mitigated as much as we can.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAn artist's concept of future exploration\nmissions: Two kilometers above the lava\nflows of Mars's Tharsis Bulge region,\na geologist collects samples from the\neastern cliff at the base of Olympus Mons,\nthe solar system's largest known shield\nvolcano.\n(NASA Image # S95-01566. Courtesy of\nJohn Frassanito and Associates)\n\nWHY\nFrom the discussions that will take place here, I hope we will gain a greater\nappreciation of our responsibility as a public organization to take on bold and\nrisky ventures, and to learn from those who have accepted private ventures and\nother approaches to how we explore risk. We want to know how to frame that\ndiscussion and debate, and evaluate that risk in a different way.\nBut, again, it is also a requirement that we do that in a diligent manner that\nminimizes and mitigates, to the maximum extent we can, what that risk may be,\nthat we understand what risk is as much as possible and, in some cases, accept\nit relative to the returns we think are feasible. That's the price of admission of\nwhat we do each and every time we're engaged in any exploration venture, be it of\nhuman spaceflight or robotic probes. It is always measured in the public domain\nand in the public eye relative to what our expectations are to that return. Indeed,\nNASA is an agency that has been defined over the course of its 46 years by great,\ngreat triumph and unbelievably deep tragedy, and we've learned from both ends\nof that spectrum. It's a consistent set of themes. It is, indeed, the singular aspect\nof what has described this agency throughout the course of its four decades.\nWe have purposely expanded the list of invitees, and we are very grateful\nto the folks who have accepted to be a part of this. We want to gain an added\nperspective from the people engaged in exploration of the Earth's most extreme\nenvironments, and learn what they can bring to the question of why we explore\nin the face of danger. What is it about that act of exploration that makes it so\nappealing? And so important? And so much of an acceptance of human desire to\nwant to understand and know that which we don't?\nWithin the NASA family, we have great respect for all who put their\nlives on the line: Not just to seek thrills, but, rather, to gain knowledge, wisdom,\nand experience that will benefit all humanity. All of those assembled here have\na unique and exciting story to tell about what drives us to explore, whether\nengaged in it directly or specifically involved in supporting its effort, all with the\nsame objective.\nAll of those stories, I have no doubt, we'll hear at this meeting. Also, we'll\nlearn from the experiences of how folks work to minimize and mitigate the risk,\nand learn where the fine line is between responsible and imprudent risk. Where is\n\"\nDO WE TAKE SUCH RISKS TO EXPLORE? AS HUMANS, WHAT IS IT ABOUT US\nTHAT REALLY WANTS TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF\nTHE HORIZON, THAT WHICH IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE?\n\"\n\"\nY D\"\nWHY\"\nWHY\nSEAN O'KEEFE\nTHE VISION FOR EXPLORATION\n\nthe differentiating line that marks that? Even when we've applied a careful calculus\nto these kinds of circumstances, in many cases and in many circumstances,\nthe events of nature will provide a set of risks that must be responded to, and\nchallenges independent of whatever control we might have over it.\nOur colleagues at the Kennedy Space Center, after their second hurricane in\nthe span of a few weeks, are dealing with just that set of challenges, of risks that\nthey are working through. And because of their extraordinary diligence, having\nsurvived two unbelievable events of what are natural disasters in their own right,\nnonetheless, have survived those experiences with all the Shuttle orbiters intact,\nall the space station hardware in great condition, and no loss of life, no injuries.\nIt's an extraordinary testimonial to the amazing diligence of Jim Kennedy, the\ndirector of the Kennedy Space Center, and what the Kennedy team has done to\nride out this set of natural disasters.\nI was down at the Kennedy Space Center with Bill Readdy a week ago,\nand the poetic kind of discrimination with which nature provides us a set of\nchallenges on risk were evident to us. I got an opportunity to see the Vertical\nAssembly Building, which is the dominant structure on the skyline of the\nKennedy Space Center that all recognize, and you could literally tell which way\nthe wind was blowing when Hurricane Frances blew in. Three of the four sides\nof the Vehicle Assembly Building were in relatively good shape. On one side of\nit, though, better than a thousand panels were blown off. Several of those panels\nhave also departed as a result of the latest hurricane that just came through. As a\nconsequence of striking some of the buildings in the area, ripping off big chunks\nof roof, all manner of consequence and destruction that occurred as a result of\nthat, all of which was mitigated in some way, shape, or form. And yet, the irony\nis that right next to the Thermal Protection Building, where a portion of the roof\nblew off next to the Vehicle Assembly Building, there was a pressure-treated\nlumber gazebo without a scratch.\nNature discriminates very profoundly, and why it does, we don't understand.\nIt certainly is a case that reminds all of us, even in such a simple example as that\none, that despite our best efforts, there are unknowns that will always rise up in any\nof these circumstances, in any case of exploration, for which the only defense we\nhave is diligence and the hope that we have mitigated against it as well as we can.\nWe're living in an era of great potential, one in which the exploration of\nthe solar system and of the Earth's most extreme environments will boost the\nopportunities we have to become a smarter, safer, healthier, and more intelligent\nworld. Certainly, we're more informed about the neighborhood we live in, a\nneighborhood defined as this little, bitty solar system around this little, puny\nstar in a gigantic galaxy that is part of a massive universe. We are just on the\ncusp of understanding what our role is in that broader case, and it's only been in\nthe last 40 years that we have come to understand it in ways that are really quite\nprofound. I'm confident that if we do this right, we'll be amazed by the rapid pace\nof progress our future exploration activities will bring about.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nBut we also know from history about the consequences of forsaking\nexploration. When we evaluate and determine as individuals, or collections\nof people and nations, to forsake those exploration opportunities, it has\nconsequences. In the 15th century, China had the opportunity to be the world's\nforemost maritime power and, indeed, possessed that capability. The Chinese\nruling class, nonetheless, decided that the sponsorship of the fleet was an\nindulgence. History, in the course of the several centuries thereafter for that\nculture, is certainly a function of those choices that were made.\nCertainly, we have the same opportunity in this country to make similar\nkinds of choices. In the 1875 time frame, the director of the Patent Office advised\nthe President of the United States that it was a good time to close down the\nPatent Office, because everything that needed to be invented had been. Had\nthe President of the United States accepted that wizened sage's advice at the\ntime, imagine where we'd be! Yet, that was based on a calculated understanding\nof what folks thought was the potential of new inventions. It wasn't reached\nwhimsically, it was reached by those who really believed that we had already\nincurred an enormous evolution of change of technology, revolution in industrial\naffairs, and, as a consequence, we were on a roll, and anything beyond that was\ngoing to be simply derivatives of the same.\nIn the last century, we've seen an explosion of growth in the exploration of\nseas, remote regions of the Earth, and, indeed, space. All of which, arguably, might\nnot have happened had that original set of recommendations been followed.\nIt is no accident that NASA's founding occurred some 46 years ago this\nvery week, in the same decade that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay first\nstood on our planet's highest peak, and that Jacques Cousteau used the good ship\nCalypso to conduct his epic voyages of undersea exploration. As explorers, we all\nshare that common bond.\nWe dare to dream grand dreams, and, in the process of doing so, assume\ntremendous risk, some of it beyond the scope of our knowledge of the time in\nwhich those dreams are assumed and accepted. We do so for what we know to be\ngreat purposes. We also, in the depths of those tragedies that occur, grieve when\nour brethren are lost in the cause of exploration. Indeed, part of the impetus for\nthis symposium was brought about in debates that occurred in the aftermath\nof the Columbia tragedy. It was a tough report that the Columbia Accident\nInvestigation Board released. It told us an awful lot about the technical problems\nthat led to it, the engineering challenges that we did not understand, and, as a\nresult, paid an ultimate price with nine people--the seven members of the crew\nas well as two engaged in the recovery of Columbia after its destruction. We\nlearned that that is a horrendous price--again.\nBut it also brought about, as a consequence of debate, a discussion about\nhow we contributed to that tragedy, and a broader public debate about a renewal\nof the purpose of why we explore. And that debate has gone on in a broader\npublic policy sense. The year after that horrific tragedy, it nonetheless was an\nSEAN O'KEEFE\nTHE VISION FOR EXPLORATION\n\nimpetus for motivating a debate by answering the fundamental question of why\nwe explore and what the strategy and path ahead should be in pursuit of that\nhuman desire to understand.\nIn the process, it also raised a series of questions that we have the\nopportunity here, over this couple of days, to at least debate how they should\nbe framed. We have, I think, as a consequence of the strategies the President has\nlevied, and the direction that he has provided to us at NASA for exploration, a\nbetter understanding now of exactly how to pursue those exploration goals. And\nit's laid out in a series of objectives and programs to achieve it, and a stepping-\nstone approach, and a whole range of different ways in which we're going to\nachieve that task.\nBut communicating the why of this venture has just begun as a public\ndebate in the last few months. Again, this is an extraordinary moment in time,\nin which there has been a renewal of that spirit of discovery and exploration. In\npart, it must then engage in this broader public dialogue, because we are, after all,\na public organization for which there is trust that is rendered to us by the public\nfor our acceptance of these kinds of challenges. And that trust is fragile, and at\neach of the intervals in which we have seen either those great triumphs or great\ntragedies, it has been tested.\nSo understanding the why, and being able to communicate that in a way\nthat's effective, is part of what this discussion is all about. And while participating\nin the panel discussions, I would ask that each of us pose the following kinds\nof questions: How do we integrate the risk calculation with the benefits to be\nderived? What's the return? How do we communicate that as well?\nBecause it's apparent, when tragedies occur, what the depth of the risk\nwas that was accepted, and then, therefore, not responded to effectively. But\nunderstanding what the benefits were to be derived sometimes gets lost in the\ntranslation, so how do we integrate that better? And that's on a personal as\nwell as a societal level. There are any number of colleagues here, and those\nwho've elected and chosen to participate in this venture, who can articulate\nthis on a personal level. But, also, how we translate that in a broader societal\ncontext, I think, is very important, why we've accepted those risks, for what\npotential gain.\nAlso, ask the question: How do we regularly remind ourselves of the risk,\nand is that really important? Is it something we really need to focus on, and to\nwhat level of depth and degree? Certainly, being accepting of it or dismissive\nof it is not one of the options, but what is the appropriate balance? Also, pose\nthe question: How do we avoid complacency? It is human nature, it is part of\nour human makeup, that what we see repetitively we begin to accept as normal?\nIf you've never seen it before, it suddenly becomes a remarkable circumstance,\nsomething which you respond to because you've never seen it before. And, yet, it\nmay be far less significant as risk than what you see every single day, yet, because\nwe see it so regularly, we accept it.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nWhat is it about our view as a culture, as a society, of why it is understood\nthat there is a risk attendant to driving an automobile, flying in a commercial\nairplane? These are things we understand as being part of that, either intuitively\nor intellectually, and have recognized that despite the fact that lots and lots\nof folks every single year die in horrific automobile accidents, we accept that,\nas humans, because of the transportation and opportunities it provides, the\nfacilitation of discourse and communication between and among each other,\nand the means to get from here to there. What is it about it that makes that an\naccepted level of risk?\nAnd, yet, in the act of exploration, when the tragedies occur, what is it that\nmakes that either intolerable or why we question it? And again, the root of this\nmay yet well be grounded in how well we understand the benefit that we think we\ngained as a consequence of the activity and the effect of accepting that risk.\nAlso, for those who are involved in wider-ranging sets of exploration\nopportunities, what is it about the risk that you accept that's different than\nthat which NASA accepts in what we do, and what is similar? How do you parse\nbetween both and determine what we can learn from this about that? And, I\nguess, the ultimate question: What can we learn from each other by how to\nframe this question differently and, indeed, communicate it more effectively as\nan opportunity for great gain?\nOver the course of human history every major advance has occurred because\nof the temerity on the part of human beings to want to understand and to explore\nand to do something that has not been tried or has been tried so irregularly as\nto have no pattern to it. If you think of every major advance in the course of our\nexistence it has been attributed to that characteristic of us as human beings.\nThis week we have an opportunity to learn from each other's experience\nso that we can go forward boldly into the unknown, informed by a responsible\nsense of how we communicate in a way that conveys the reasons why it is or is\nnot accepted as an appropriate level of risk. We are resolved at NASA to better\ncommunicate with the public about why it's necessary to take those risks, and\nwhy it is inherent in the way we, as human beings, conduct our lives in a way\nthat would give meaning and purpose to this larger exploration agenda. At its\n\"\n\"\n. . . WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER'S EXPERIENCE\nSO THAT WE CAN GO FORWARD BOLDLY INTO THE UNKNOWN, INFORMED BY A\nRESPONSIBLE SENSE OF HOW WE COMMUNICATE IN A WAY THAT CONVEYS THE\nREASONS WHY IT IS OR IS NOT ACCEPTED AS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RISK.\n\"\n\"\nSEAN O'KEEFE\nTHE VISION FOR EXPLORATION\n\ncore the answer is best summarized by a comment President Bush made in\nHouston just days after the Columbia tragedy, that this cause of exploration is\nnot an option we choose, it is a desire written in the human heart. And when we\ncan confront that, even on both ends of the equation--in its great triumph as\nwell as in its depths of tragedy--and we're reminded why we're driven to this,\nwhat is it we can do responsibly as public servants, for those of us at NASA and\nin the broader community of explorers represented here, to communicate that\nmore effectively?\nI thank you all for your participation, and I look forward to sharing with\nall of you the spirit of exploration and discovery that I think is certainly evident\nin this group by so many people who have elected to spend their time to engage\nin these important questions. The manner in which we have framed this over\nthese couple of days will bring those kinds of questions to bear in ways that, as\nwe move forward in this next step of exploration, to return to flight, to complete\nthe International Space Station, to develop through Project Constellation an\nopportunity to explore beyond Earth's orbit, all of this may be the beginnings\nagain of an opportunity to frame that discussion and debate, not only among\nourselves, but in the broader public, in ways that highlight those purposes of\nexploration, and why we engage in the risks and accept them, knowingly, for the\npurposes for which NASA began.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nRace to the Moon\nI'm an ancient mariner here and I see a lot more modern\nastronauts who have done a lot more than I have ever done. But I think the previous\nspeakers have really set the scene for this discussion of how we perceive risk. Now, I\nwould like to expand this concept of risk as it pertains to spaceflight, and, of course, Apollo\n13. But before I do, let me digress and tell several personal stories familiar to me of how I\nthink risk is perceived.\nThe first story takes place long before we had NASA astronauts. After World War\nII, Wernher von Braun came over from Germany, and he and his team went out to White\nSands, New Mexico with a bunch of dilapidated V-2 rockets. Their job was to fire those\nrockets up into the upper atmosphere and, with the proper sensors, determine maybe what\nthe stratosphere was like--the flow, the elements, and things like that.\nBut von Braun was a very farseeing individual. He knew that someday man would\ngo into space, and he would piggyback on these rockets some experiments that would\ndetermine, or help to determine, if man could survive in the environment of zero gravity.\nHe would put small animals in the nose cone of these rockets and put a camera at the apex.\nAnd, then, as the rocket got up to the top of its apogee and started to come down, before\nll\ni\nll\ni\ni\nCaptain Lovell was selected as an astronaut by NASA in September 1962. He served as Command\nModule pilot and navigator on the epic six-day journey of Apollo 8, man's maiden voyage to the Moon.\nOn that flight, Lovell and fellow crewmen, Frank Borman and William A. Anders, became the first humans\nto leave the Earth's gravitational influence. He was spacecraft commander of the Apollo 13 flight,\n11-17 April 1970, and became the first man to journey twice to the Moon. Captain Lovell held the record\nfor time in space with a total of 715 hours and 5 minutes until surpassed by the Skylab flights.\nJames Love\nFormer NASA Astronaut and Pres dent, Love\nCommun cat ons\n\nit reached terminal velocity, he would photograph their reaction to see how they\nwould react in zero gravity.\nNow, my story takes place out there at White Sands. One beautiful, blue\nday, out on the launch pad, is this dilapidated old V-2 rocket--gaseous oxygen\njust streaming out from the vent. Inside the nose cone there are two mice\nstrapped tightly to their couches. This one mouse looks a little worried. His tail\nis twitching back and forth, and perspiration is coming out on his whiskers. He\nlooks at his companion and says, \"You know, I'm getting scared. The rocket could\nblow up! The parachute could fail to open! A mouse could get killed doing this\nkind of work!\" And his companion, who had made about three flights before,\nsaid, \"It beats hell out of cancer research!\" So, in this particular case, this mouse\nfigured that risk was the lesser of two evils.\nNow, I'm going to tell you another personal story about this idea of risk. I'll\ngo forward quite a bit to Gemini 7, Frank Borman and I are on a two-week mission--\nthe purpose was to find out if man could live in space for two weeks, the maximum\ntime to go to the Moon. And here is a case where, because of the newness of the\nsituation, that risk was way overblown. The Gemini spacecraft proved to be a fairly\ndecent vehicle; Gemini 3, 4, 5, and 6 were pretty good. But in those days, NASA and\nthe doctors and the hierarchy--management--put the astronauts in the spacecraft\nand got them to keep their suits on all the time to fly these missions. For the first\ncouple of missions--three and a half hours or even one day--that's fine. But, as\ntime went on, those suits got to be more uncomfortable all the time, you know,\noxygen flowing through the body, drying up the body pretty badly.\nSo by the time Gemini 7 came around, a two-week mission, we were\ndetermined that we were going to get out of our suits. We had a special suit but\nit was still bulky and uncomfortable. So we took off--and the first thing we then\nwanted to do was get out of the suits. We found out that the spacecraft's integrity\nwas there. Nothing was leaking. Everything was fine. Management said, \"No.\nNo--stay in those suits.\" We said, \"But everything is going fine here.\" Finally, out\nof desperation, I had unzipped my suit and I had snuck out of it (or almost), and I\nwas out of my suit in everything but name. Poor Borman was still in his suit, and\nI could see he was getting more tired and difficult. And, finally, after about three\nand a half or four days, we finally got permission to get out of the suits.\nSo, here's a case where the risk was overkill. I mean, we knew the spacecraft\nwas good. We knew the best way to fly was in our underwear, not the suits. And\nnow, of course, as you and I see on TV, on the shuttle flights they're in shorts and\nT-shirts, so that's the way that goes.\nAnd then the third little story I want to tell you about risk is one that\nyou all know, but I think it's a classic. And it was the Apollo 8 flight. Apollo 8\nwas going to be an Earth orbital mission--around the Earth to test the Lunar\nModule and Command Module before we'd ever commit those two vehicles\nto go to the Moon. And as you know, two things happened in the summer of\n'68. Number one, Grumman Aircraft finally bit the bullet and said, \"Hey, we're\nnot going to get this Lunar Module ready before 1969.\" And then again, we had\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nOPENING PHOTO:\nThe Apollo 13 lunar landing mission crew\nfrom left to right are: Commander James\nA. Lovell Jr., Command Module pilot,\nJohn L. Swigert Jr., and Lunar Module\npilot, Fred W. Haise Jr.\n(NASA Image # S70-36485)\n\nintelligence information that the Soviets were going to put a man around the\nMoon, a circumnavigation flight around the Moon, before the end of 1968--in\nfact, in the late fall of 1968.\nAnd, as a matter of fact, we know now, talking to them and with everything\nin the open, that they were very serious about it. Their N-1 big lunar rocket was\na failure, but their Proton and Zond probably could have done the job. And, so, I\nthink in the fall or summer of '68, they sent Zond 5 around the Moon with small\nanimals. I think the reentry was so steep that the animals died, but it was a test\nthat they were doing to see if they could put two cosmonauts around the Moon.\nThey sent another spacecraft--Zond 6 Proton went around the Moon again. And\nwhile that flight was not a complete success, it had the possibilities of success.\nAnd here's where the change took place. In the Soviet Union, the hierarchy--\nthe management--was arguing: \"Is the risk worth the reward of beating the\nAmericans at least to get two guys around the Moon, or should we send another\nunmanned or animal-bound flight around the Moon before we commit to the\npeople?\" Leonov and Makarov, the two cosmonauts, were all set to go. They were\narguing: \"Let's go.\" Other people said no.\nAnd while they were hesitating--while they were vacillating back and\nforth--a bold decision was made in this country, in the fact that the Lunar\nModule was not ready, but Apollo 7 showed that the Command Service Module\ncould last for 11 days. And so, the decision was made to send Apollo 8 around the\nMoon and to look for landing sites and things like that.\nSo here was a case where we analyzed the risk and we thought that the\nreward--the achievement and the ability to continue the Apollo program for\nlanding--was well worth it.\nSo, let me first state that everything in life involves a degree of risk--\nand I think I've mentioned that before--from the moment we are born until\nwe die. And the risk can involve physical, financial, or emotional factors. You\nknow, the Hollywood stuntman has to weigh the reward for his efforts to the\nrisk he faces. The investor faces a risk of financial gain or loss. And, certainly,\nwhen we get married, the emotional risk is there for a happy marriage or a quick\ndivorce. Therefore, when we have control of our destinies, such as an active space\nprogram, we must analyze the reward we achieve for the risk involved and the\naction we must take to minimize that risk.\n\"\n\"\nSO HERE WAS A CASE WHERE WE ANALYZED THE RISK AND WE THOUGHT\nTHAT THE REWARD--THE ACHIEVEMENT AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE\nTHE APOLLO PROGRAM FOR LANDING--WAS WELL WORTH IT.\n\"\n\"\nJAMES LOVELL\nRACE TO THE MOON\n\nIn the space program--at least the one I knew--we approached the risk\nfactor in many ways. First, the contractors, of course, set standards for maximum\nreliability--99 percent, if possible. And they used the concept of redundancy,\nyou know--one of this or two of this or three of that. In case one failed, we had\nbackups. Every effort was made to simplify space system design. One example:\nIn the Lunar Module propulsion system, pressure-fed fuel systems were used\ninstead of the more complicated pump systems. We incorporated escape systems.\nOur design of the trajectory to the Moon--the first part--would be a free-return\ncourse. That meant if the spacecraft's main engines failed in its inflight test, the\nspacecraft would be on a course that would take it to the Moon--and the Moon's\ngravity would aim it back towards the Earth. And by using only the spacecraft's\nattitude rockets, it could safely land back here on Earth. Thus, an added safety\nfactor was given to the mission.\nOf course, the intense systems training by the Mission Control team and\nastronauts was essential--including an analysis of possible failure modes and\ntraining to recover from them. Now, this training pointed out the limits on\nefforts to reduce risk in an Apollo mission. We only trained for single-point\nfailures. Had we tried to train and develop recovering techniques for all possible\ncombinations of failures--well, we'd still be at Cape Canaveral waiting for the\nfirst takeoff. And therein lies the problem between risk and reward.\nI guess the best way to visualize this, at least from my point of view, is\nto picture a simple X/Y graph--a plot. Let's say that at the top of the Y, the\nordinate at the top, is a factor up there saying \"maximum risk.\" And then as we\ngradually go down the Y ordinate, the risk decreases all the way down until we\nget down to the juncture of the Y and the X graph--and there, theoretically, is\nzero risk. On the X axis, we put all those factors that we might be able to make in\nterms of cost--those factors that we can put into a spacecraft that would reduce\nrisk--high reliability, redundancy, extra safety equipment that would cover any\nfailures, true training, et cetera.\nI kind of think that as we plot the graph going down, that the risk\nwould decrease very rapidly until we got to some point where it would start to\nflatten out and keep parallel, never getting down to zero risk. As a matter of fact,\nI also think that had we continued to go out, adding additional redundancies,\nadding other equipment to handle other failures that might occur, and giving\nthe crews more intense training, more procedures that they had to follow in\ncase there are certain things that go wrong, that the risk factor would actually\nstart to go back up again. Therefore, there's got to be a point whereby we can\ndevelop a system that we minimize the risk but without going overboard,\nbecause eventually you'll compromise the spacecraft's ability to complete its\nassigned mission.\nNow, I think we did a fairly decent job in weighing the acceptable risks\nwith effort to reduce risk in the Apollo program. The first six Apollo missions\nproved that. On Apollo 11, Mission Control quickly resolved the landing radar\nproblem. The brilliant analysis by John Aaron saved the Apollo 12 mission after\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\na lightning strike on takeoff. And so, by Apollo 13, Mission Control people and\nspacecraft crews were confident that they could handle any situation. There\nwas, however, a wild card in our assumptions, and it surfaced on 13. Now Apollo\n13 was the third lunar landing mission and strictly, I think, the first scientific\nflight. It was targeted to land in the hills surrounding a crater called Fra Mauro.\nThe scientists thought the lunar material there would be different from that in\nApollo 11 or 12 and, of course, we thought the surface there would tell us about\nthe interior of the Moon.\nThe launch occurred on April 11, 1970, at 13:13 Central Standard Time.\nPerhaps the spacecraft number and the time was sort of a premonition of the\nevents to come. During launch phase, our first crisis occurred. The center engine\non the booster's second stage shut down two minutes early due to a \"pogo effect\"\nor extreme oscillation on its structure. Now, this pogo effect was noticed in one\nof the booster's unmanned flights.\nTo reduce the risk in this area, an engine shut-down device was added\nto prevent the engine from going divergent and disintegrating. In addition, the\nbooster was slightly overbuilt to allow a one-engine failure. Here was an example\nof added safety features to reduce the risk of a flight. Our initial trajectory to the\nMoon was that free-return course that I mentioned. But at 30 hours after launch,\nwe changed our flight path to what we call the hybrid course. Now this was\nnecessary to provide the proper visibility for a safe landing in Fra Mauro. And\nhere is where we traded the reduced risk of a safe return home for the guarantee\nof a good visibility. Should our spacecraft engine fail now, our closest point of\napproach to the Earth on our return would be about 2,500 miles out. Much too\nfar out for a safe capture by the Earth's atmosphere.\nWe didn't worry about it. Fourth flight--second time to the Moon--and I\nwas getting complacent.\nThe explosion took place two days and 200,000 miles from Earth, resulting\nin the loss of all the oxygen, electrical power, and propulsion of the Command\nService Module. At this point, the flight of Apollo 13 changed from another\nthrilling space adventure to a classic case of crisis management. It was here, too,\nthat other factors came into play to reduce the risk involved in spaceflight.\nThese are the attributes, or human characteristics, of a well-trained\nMission Control team: good leadership--not just at the top--but throughout\nthe organization, leadership that develops teamwork among all those involved,\nincluding contractors; use of initiative to find solutions to problems never\ncontemplated or trained for; the ability to focus and persevere to find the right\nsolution for each crisis; and, of course, a team that was well motivated to get\nthe job done. Now, these are the ingredients that turned Apollo 13 from an\nalmost certain disaster into a successful recovery. Mission Control and the flight\ncrew worked together to configure the Lunar Module into a lifeboat. The crew\nsuccessfully transferred the controls to the Lunar Module just as the Command\nModule died. Procedures were developed to use the Lunar Module landing engine\nto put the spacecraft back on a free-returning course.\nJAMES LOVELL\nRACE TO THE MOON\n\nLet me digress a little bit on this. There is something that I had learned\nin the space program, based on what I am about to say, that I took with me\nfrom the public sector into the private sector: Always expect the unexpected.\nWhen everything is going right--when everything looks rosy, when nothing is\nwrong--it's always nice to look ahead to see if there are symptoms coming down\nthat maybe are pending for a possible crisis.\nWhen I started to maneuver--now remember, I have two spacecraft mated\ntogether and I'm controlling from the Lunar Module, and remember, also, that\nI spent many, many hours in simulators learning how to fly a Lunar Module.\nBut when I put an input in to make a certain change of attitude, the spacecraft\ndidn't respond that way. I couldn't figure out why. If I wanted to go down, it\nwent up. If I went left, it went right. I mean, after all these hours! Well, then it\ndawned on me. I had a 60,000 pound dead mass attached to the Lunar Module ,\nAn interior view of the Apollo 13 Lunar Module and the \"mailbox,\" the jerry-rigged arrangement the Apollo 13 astronauts\nbuilt to use the Command Module lithium hydroxide canisters to purge carbon dioxide from the Lunar Module.\n(NASA Image # AS13-62-8929)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nthe Command Service Module, which, of course, we needed to get back into the\natmosphere. The Lunar Module had never been designed to be maneuvered with\nthe Command Service Module attached. We had to quickly figure out how an\ninput would give me the right output to get to the proper attitude to make that\nburn to get back on the free-returning course.\nNow, again, it was discovered that the crew was being poisoned by their\nown exhalations. The round canisters in the Lunar Module to remove the carbon\ndioxide were becoming saturated. In the dead Command Module there were\nplenty of unused, square canisters.\nUsing their initiative, the crew systems division thought up a way to use\ntape, plastic, cardboard, and an old sock to adapt a square canister to the Lunar\nModule. This removed the over-abundance of CO2 in the Lunar Module and, of\ncourse, prevented the poisoning of the crew. And, so, there was another little\nincident in system design. Why we had square canisters in the Command Module\nand round canisters in the Lunar Module, I will never know to this day.\nThroughout the return home, the risk of disaster decreased and the odds\nbecame more positive as each crisis was analyzed and a solution developed. When\nit became apparent that the spacecraft would miss the narrow return corridor for\na safe landing, a procedure was used that was developed as a last ditch measure\nfor Apollo 8. I was on that flight as a navigator, so I happened to know about it.\nUsing the Earth's terminator as a guide, a seat-of-the-pants manual maneuver\nwas accomplished to put the spacecraft back on proper course. Again, proper\ntraining, including an analysis of how to make course changes after experiencing\nnavigational failure, saved the day.\nIf, in the development of the Apollo program, we carefully balanced the risk\nversus the reward of a lunar landing by incorporating such factors as extreme\nreliability, redundancy, simplification, and intense training to reduce the risk, then\nwhat happened on 13? Apollo 7 through 12 succeeded in doing their missions, and\nthe problems they encountered were easily solved by Mission Control working\nwith their crews.\nThe answer is human error. It's a virus that can be embedded in the best laid\nplans. Those of you familiar with the causes of aircraft accidents will understand\nthat most accidents are caused by a series of events that overcome the pilot\nand/or the aircraft. Such was the case with Apollo 13. The first event occurred\nabout eight years before Apollo 13 took off. NASA ordered all Apollo contractors\nto make their electrical systems compatible with the 65 volt DC power available\nat the Kennedy Space Center--even though the spacecraft were designed to fly\nwith a 28-volt DC power system. That would simplify the testing at KSC. The\ncontractors complied with this request with one exception. A thermostat, part\nof the heater system inside the oxygen tanks, was not exchanged for one that\ncould handle the high voltage. The job of the thermostat was to protect the tank\nfrom overheating. When the temperature rose to about 80 degrees Fahrenheit,\nthe contacts would open, shutting off the heater power. At 65-volts DC power,\nhowever, the contacts could be welded shut, thus bypassing this safety feature.\nJAMES LOVELL\nRACE TO THE MOON\n\nAll tanks on Apollo 7 through 12 had this anomaly, but none experienced the\nsufficient heater operation during testing to damage their thermostats.\nA second incident occurred during the oxygen tank manufacture. A tank,\ndesignated for Apollo 10, was dropped at the factory. It was retested for flight\nqualification, but, because of the lost time, it was reassigned to Apollo 13.\nSeveral weeks before the launch of 13, the third incident took place.\nWith the booster, the spacecraft all assembled on the launch pad, a countdown\ndemonstration test was performed, making sure that all the components were\nready for launch. The test was successful, but after the test, the ground crew\ncould not remove the liquid oxygen from one of the spacecraft tanks. A review\nof the history of the tank revealed the damage incident at the factory. Studying\nthe design of the tank indicated that, although the tank performed perfectly for\nall inflight operations, the fall could have impaired the ground crew's ability to\nremove the oxygen after a ground test.\nTo replace the tank would slip the launch by a month, and so the decision\nwas made to use the tank's heater system to remove the oxygen by boiling it off.\nThe procedure was successful, but as the level of the liquid oxygen decreased, the\ntemperature rose. At 80 degrees, the contacts of the thermostat started to open\nto shut off the power. The high voltage welded them shut, and the thermostat,\ninstead of shutting off the power, became a conduit to keep the heater system\non. We know now that the temperature rose to about 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nseverely damaging the heater system. The problem was not detected. When the\ntank was filled with liquid oxygen, it was a bomb ready to go off. It exploded two\ndays later, 200,000 miles from Earth, when we turned on the heater system.\nI might digress another little bit here because, in all this discussion of\nrisk, there is a factor that's called fate, luck, or something like that. This was\nthe third time we turned on the heater system; nothing happened the first two\ntimes. If something happened the first time we turned on the heater system and\nthat explosion occurred, we would never have had enough electrical power to get\nall the way around the Moon and get back home again, as we had already put the\nvelocity on to go to the Moon.\nIf it did not explode when it did, but waited until we turned on the heater\nsystem later, once we were in lunar orbit or when the Lunar Module was on the\nsurface, we would never have had enough fuel in the Lunar Module to either get\nout of lunar orbit, or get enough to get back home again.\n\"\n\"\n. . . IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT ON THE WAY TO THE MOON,\nOUR RESEARCH SHOWS BE SURE YOU HAVE IT 200,000 MILES OUT.\n\"\n\"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nSo, if you're going to have an accident on the way to the Moon, our research\nshows be sure you have it 200,000 miles out.\nI asked Gene Kranz, who was the lead flight director, what lessons he\nlearned from Apollo 13 that could be applied to the Mission Control team--and\nmaybe all of NASA. Here are some of his comments: Develop the chemistry of a\nwinner. The mind-set for success must be embedded in the values and culture of\nthe organization. Be positive. Be optimistic. Do the right thing the first time.\nA second comment that he made: articulate a common vision that\nfocuses your energies on your objective; team focus to accomplish the mission,\nwhether it is in crisis mode or whether it's the entire organization. This\nwas outlined by the President just recently. We must focus our energies on\naccomplishing that mission.\nThe third thing he mentioned: teamwork provides the multidisciplinary\ncapability to deal with complex and fast-moving problems. We can say many\nbrains are better than one. Get the team together. Think up the solution. And, I\nkind of think, when I look back now on our Apollo program, that this was pretty\ncommon throughout our entire NASA organization. We had good leadership at\nHeadquarters. Marshall did the booster. Goddard did the network. Johnson did\nthe spacecraft and the crew training. Kennedy did the launch and the integration\nof the whole thing. So, we had a pretty good team.\nFourth, Kranz says: build momentum quickly. This allows rapid response\nto limit problem growth. I think what he means there is that a quick response\nwill give an insight to head off future problems that might be the result of an\noriginal problem.\nHe also says: be flexible. Solutions often lie outside the box. The idea there\nwas the carbon dioxide incident on 13.\nAnd then he says also: don't get distracted, and don't let your team get\ndistracted. For Apollo 13, on that particular flight, when I was waiting for the\ninformation to come up to re-energize to get the Command Module back in\noperation again, there was delay after delay, and I thought that they were going\nto set up more information to find out what went wrong and give us more things\nto do than just get the spacecraft ready. I didn't want the crew down there at\nMission Control to be distracted. I needed those basic procedures to get the\nCommand Module going again.\nHe then says: overwhelm the problem. Use every available asset. As soon\nas you have one, call in everybody who has any idea of what may be happening,\nalmost like verbal popcorn, but then you can winnow out what is good and what\nis not good.\nFinally, his idea is: keep the poise. Let your words and actions convince your\nteam that you are controlling events. Good leadership. You saw the movie. Gene\nKranz, like Ed Harris when the whole Control Center is talking about finding out\nwhat went wrong when they found out about the explosion, says, \"Stop guessing.\nStop guessing. Let's work the problem.\"\nJAMES LOVELL\nRACE TO THE MOON\n\nIn our approach to accomplish the President's directive of revisiting the\nMoon and on to Mars, we must accept a certain amount of risk and realize that\nunforeseen events are always present. The strategy of spacecraft development\nand mission design is to minimize the risk without compromising the goal.\nWhenever you are involved in an operation that handles thousands of pounds of\nhigh explosives, reaches extreme velocities, operates in a vacuum environment\nunder zero gravity, and then encounters tremendously high temperatures on\nreturn, you are, if I can borrow the title from one of Tom Cruise's old movies, in\na \"risky business.\"The people involved in that business and those who monitor,\ncritique, and investigate the results, should recognize that fact.\nTo be completely risk-averse is never to take off.\nWe should be aware that sometime in the future, we will again hear\nthose words: \"Houston, we have a problem,\" and I hope we'll be prepared to\nmeet the challenge. Or, if I can steal the words from Gene Kranz, \"failure is not\nan option\".\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nl\n:\nl\nl\ni\nBo d Endeavors\nLessons from Po ar and Space Exp orat on\nIt is an understatement to say that it is a pleasure to be here today\nto talk to you about some of my research. The concept of risk is something with which we\nall are familiar. Every decision that we make from the most trivial to the most important is\nattended by some sort of evaluation and consideration of the costs and the benefits, and the\nlikelihood of a successful outcome.\nExpedition risk is of a different order. And humans are not particularly good at\nestimating risk. The research shows that we have a tendency to underestimate risk over\nwhich we have some control, and to overrate risk over which we have no control. That's\nwhy we take the risk of driving on the highways, where presently there are 1.5 fatalities\nper 100 million miles traveled--incidentally that's down from 5.5 fatalities per 100 million\nmiles traveled in 1966. You were four times more likely to die in a traffic crash 30 years ago\nthan you are now, and there are nearly twice the number of automobiles and vehicle miles\ntraveled. We've done a lot to reduce risk in certain areas.\nBut why do nations and individuals explore? I have here just a partial list. Trade\nroutes, looking for new resources, in some cases national prestige, and, of course, science.\nIndividuals explore sometimes to satisfy a need for achievement, to do something special,\ni\nl\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nl\ni\ni\ni\nBold Endeavors: Lessons From Polar and Space Exploration, published in\nJack Stuster\nBehav ora Sc ent st and V ce Pres dent and Pr nc pa Sc ent st, Anacapa Sc ences, Inc.\nJack Stuster's work for NASA has included a study of Space Shuttle refurbishing procedures and studies\nof conditions on Earth that are analogous to space missions, including an analysis of diaries maintained\nby the leaders and physicians at French remote duty stations in the Antarctic and on small islands\nin the South Indian Ocean. He has developed design and procedural recommendations to enhance\nthe habitability of the International Space Station, future spacecraft, and planetary facilities. Stuster\ncompleted a study of Antarctic winter-over experiences, expeditions, and voyages of discovery, which\nare documented in his book\n1996 by the Naval Institute Press.\n\nmany times out of curiosity, including scientific curiosity, and I truly believe\nthat some people explore because they need to accept risk. Life just isn't enough\nwithout taking some chances. However, taking calculated chances is far different\nthan being rash.\nEvery bold endeavor that I've read about was accompanied by naysayers,\npeople who predicted that the expedition would result in disaster. It's archetypal\nthat Columbus had difficulty finding the financing for his planned expedition.\nIt wasn't because people believed the world was flat. By 1492 all learned people\nknew that the world was a sphere. The circumference of the Earth had been\ncalculated by the Greeks, and then again later, and accurately, 400 years B.C. or\nso, and again later, but the later estimate was off by a large factor.\nColumbus believed that he would reach Japan after traveling about 3,200\nmiles west. He was right. He did make landfall 33 days after leaving Spain. But\nhad he known that it was really 10,000 miles to Japan, and that a continent or\ntwo interrupted his voyage, he might not have taken that risk. He did maintain\ntwo journals, one for his own use, and one for the crew that showed they were\nmaking far greater progress than they actually were--a way for him to minimize\nhis personal risk on board.\nThere are many justifications for exploration. One of my favorites is from\nFridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian explorer, that might seem appropriate in this age\nwhen people complain about spending money on space. I mean--the critics say we\nshould spend it here--as if the money were actually taken into space and thrown\nout of the spacecraft. But Nansen, who was a scientist as well as an explorer,\nwrote that \"people perhaps still exist who believe that it is of no importance\nto explore the unknown regions. This, of course, shows ignorance. The history\nof the human race is a continual struggle from darkness toward light.\" I think\nthat's beautiful. \"It is therefore to no purpose to discuss the use of knowledge.\nMan wants to know, and when he ceases to do so, he is no longer man.\" I think\nthat says it all. And also, Nansen was an early supporter of women's suffrage, so\nplease don't judge him by his 19th century usage of the term 'man.'\nRoald Amundsen was a little more blunt in saying that \"Little minds only\nhave room for thoughts of bread and butter.\" But I will talk more about both\n\"\n\"\nTHE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS A CONTINUAL STRUGGLE FROM DARK-\nNESS TOWARD LIGHT.\" I THINK THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. \"IT IS THEREFORE TO NO\nPURPOSE TO DISCUSS THE USE OF KNOWLEDGE. MAN WANTS TO KNOW,\nAND WHEN HE CEASES TO DO SO, HE IS NO LONGER MAN.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nReplicas of Christopher Columbus's\nsailing ships Santa Maria, Nina, and Pinta\nsail by Endeavour (orbiter vehicle 105) on\nKennedy Space Center Launch Complex\nPad 39B, awaiting liftoff for its maiden\nvoyage, STS-49, on 7 May 1992.\n(NASA Image # S92-39077)\n\"\n\"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nNansen and Amundsen in a few minutes. There are many things I want to talk\nabout that I'm sure I'm going to forget, so forgive me for that.\nRobert Falcon Scott wrote, after his first expedition to Antarctica, about\nhow ill-prepared they were. \"Not a single article of the outfit had been tested,\nand amid the general ignorance that prevailed, the lack of system was painfully\napparent in everything.\" Robert Falcon Scott gave great advice about things, but\nhe didn't really take his own advice. In his final hours, having reached the South\nPole in 1912, only to find that Roald Amundsen had been there 30 days earlier,\nand on the trip back, laying in his tent with comrades who had perished beside\nhim, he wrote in his journal that \"We took risks, we knew that we took them.\nThings came out against us, and therefore, we have no cause for complaint.\"\nScott was unlucky also. They perished only 8 miles from the supply\ndepot that had been prepared for them. They just couldn't get to it in the\nstorm--1912 had been an unusually stormy year in Antarctica. Under other\nconditions, they might have made it to the depot and come home to write an\naccount of their expedition.\nApsley Cherry-Garrard, who was also a member of Scott's expeditions,\nwrote that \"the members of this expedition believed that it was worthwhile to\ndiscover new land and new life, to reach the South Pole of the Earth, to make\nelaborate meteorological and magnetic observations and so forth. They were\nprepared to suffer great hardships, and some of them died for their beliefs.\"\nThey should have been more prepared. Others were. Scott used Manchurian\nponies, which didn't really cut it in the snow, nor had they ever tested the tractors\nthey took to Antarctica. There was a certain hubris involved. Amundsen used\ndog sleds. The British would not use dogs or skis. It wasn't British. They were\ngoing to slog it out.\nMost of my work has involved the risks associated with the psychological,\nbehavioral, and human aspects of isolation and confinement. I use the following\nanalogy to help people get a handle on what it would really be like to be on an\nexpedition to Mars. Imagine living in a motor home with five other people for\nthree years. You're driving around the country, and you really can't get out for\nabout a year, and then, when you go outside, it's for very brief periods, and you\nhave to wear spacesuits, and you come back, and then you spend another year or so\ndriving around with those same five people. You've already heard every story that\nthey've ever told. The days blend one into another. The condition becomes mind-\nnumbing, and the tiniest, tiniest things get on your nerves. It is characteristic\nof all conditions of isolation and confinement that trivial issues are exaggerated\nway out of proportion. Everyone who I've interviewed about this talks about how\nthey would have an incredible argument at an Antarctic research station over a fax\ntransmission or something, and blow up, and then an hour later wonder: \"What\nthe heck happened? What was that all about?\" It is a universal occurrence.\nOne of the other universals of isolation and confinement is the strange\nrelationships that occur with your Mission Control, with your headquarters,\nwherever it is located--in Antarctica, it might be Port Hueneme, or it might\nJACK STUSTER\nBOLD ENDEAVORS\n\nbe the Johnson Space Center or elsewhere. But the remote crew always gets the\nimpression that \"They really don't understand the conditions under which we're\noperating. We're trying to get a job done here and they're not responding fast\nenough.\" Or, \"They're giving us too much to do.\" It always happens. And, you\nknow, I used to think that it was just endemic to isolation and confinement,\nbut I think it's a structural condition. Even the field offices of a corporation, a\nsmall one or a large one, or perhaps the research centers of a major government\nagency might feel these same sorts of tension. It is just a natural phenomenon\nthat occurs. If you're prepared for it, you can somehow reduce the risk.\nAnyway, an expedition to Mars would be a lot like this metaphor that I've\ndescribed for you. The first research that I conducted for NASA was conducted for\nthe Ames Research Center. In 1982 they took a chance on this anthropologist who\nwas working in the field of human factors to study conditions on Earth that are\nanalogous to what we expected for future space crews. I studied conditions such as\noffshore oil platforms, commercial research vessels, fishing vessels, fleet ballistic\nmissile submarines, saturation divers, and so forth, and came up with 100 or so\ndesign recommendations. It's my understanding that a couple of them actually\nmade it to the final design of the International Space Station, for which I'm grateful.\nI would like to know which ones they are. Personal sleeping quarters I don't think\nhas made it, and that was one of the most important recommendations.\nMore recently, I've conducted research through the Johnson Space\nCenter concerning longer-duration missions, one year to three years. The only\nanalogues available for such a long mission are previous expeditions. And, of\ncourse, I included our experience with Skylab, and there is much of relevance\nfrom Skylab.\nNASA has a tradition of trying to learn from the past, and in many cases\nis successful. However, I remember reading in one of the industry publications\nthat: \"One of the great lessons from the NASA experience on board Mir was that\nyou really shouldn't hard-schedule everything. You should have this task list\nthat you put things on. And then the crew can go and take from that task list\nas necessary. Isn't that a wonderful thing?\" I thought: My gosh, that was the\nprinciple behavioral finding from Skylab. Didn't anybody read those wonderful\nlessons learned reports from Skylab?\nSo, I wrote a letter to the editor, and I probably angered a whole lot of\npeople in doing so, but there is a lot that we can learn from the past, including\nour own more recent past.\nI've found that expeditions, and polar winter-over experiences in particular,\nresemble in many ways what we can reasonably expect for future space crews.\nChronologically, the earliest of the expeditions that I studied was Columbus's\nfirst voyage of discovery. And although it was only 33 days out to the New\nWorld and seven months total, there really is a lot to learn from that experience.\nFor example, he had strong-willed subordinates who questioned his authority\nregularly. One of them [Pinzon, commander of the Pinta] left the expedition in\nsearch of gold to the north, leaving the two principal vessels.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nAnd it's probably not well known that on Christmas Day, 1492, the Santa\nMaria went ashore and was broken up. The reason was the crew had partied the\nnight before, celebrating Christmas Eve, and left the watch to a cabin boy who\ndidn't know what to do when the ship slipped its anchor. No one was killed\nduring the process, but it left Columbus with only one hull.\nColumbus believed in triple redundancy long before it was a NASA policy,\nand he probably would not have left Europe with fewer than three hulls, and\ncertainly would not have returned. Oddly, in one of those incredible coincidences\nthat occurs that I've read about in the history of exploration, Pinzon rounds the\nbend of this little island--this tiny island where the crew was trying to decide\nwhat to do. Would they be able to rebuild and make a small craft out of the\nremnants of the Santa Maria? And then Pinzon shows up. They were able to\nreturn home, but in the two smallest of the three craft.\nRedundancy is an important method for reducing risk and increasing\nreliability. There are other methods: overbuilding--you build the valve to\nwithstand 150 percent of what you expect it to withstand; graceful degradation, so\nthat you have time to do something about it; and maintainability. When you have\na human crew, you should really take advantage of the crew for maintainability.\nOne of my favorite explorers is the French explorer, Jules-Sebastien-\nCesar Dumont d'Urville. Early in his career, he was on the island of Milos when\npeople approached him about a statue that was hidden in a cave. He saw it and\nwanted it for France, so they dragged it down to the ship, breaking off two arms\nin the process. It's what we know as the Venus de Milo. Later in his career, he\ncommanded two expeditions to the Pacific and to Antarctica. He was one of the\nfirst to see the mainland of Antarctica, which he named Adelie Land for his wife,\nwhom he rarely saw. He also named the linguistic groups of the Pacific with\nthe names that we use today--Polynesian, Melanesian, Micronesian. He was an\nexceptional leader. At a time when expeditions--naval ships, in particular--were\ncommanded autocratically, he was a kind and generous captain. He dressed as\nthe crew did, which perplexed the British any time they met, because they didn't\nunderstand. They didn't believe he was truly the captain when he was wearing a\nstraw hat and an open shirt. He was a realistic man.\nOn his second expedition, he was required to leave Marseilles carrying\nplants to the South Pacific. I don't know exactly what the plants were, but he had\nlots and lots of plants. At first, he objected to it because they were in pots and\nall over the ship, including in his cabin. And, after a week at sea, he wrote in his\njournal that this was a wonderful addition to an expedition and, if he had his way\nwith things, every French ship that left port would be accompanied by plenty of\nfoliage and greenery inside. I think that that's not too dissimilar from some of\nthe comments that we've heard from space crews loving to spend time with the\ngrowing experiments on board.\nThe French had discovered early on something that was very painfully\nlearned elsewhere, and that is, that there's often conflict among subgroups in\nan isolated and confined situation, and there were a lot of problems with the\nJACK STUSTER\nBOLD ENDEAVORS\n\ncivilian scientists and the military crew. The scientists were outside of the\ncommand structure and it was always a problem, which led to the demise of some\nexpeditions, or contributed to it, at least. So the French would take bright Naval\nofficers and train them to be botanists or natural philosophers and artists.\nIt's particularly appropriate that we talk a little bit about the Lewis and\nClark expedition in this year of the bicentennial. And there is much to learn,\neven though there are great differences. It was all outdoors, for one thing, and not\nin a confined environment, except when they were in winter quarters in Oregon\nwhere it was raining all the time. One of the things that we can learn from the\nLewis and Clark expedition is to establish a spirit of the expedition. Thomas\nJefferson named it the \"Corps of Discovery\"--a brilliant thing to do. I was very\npleased in 1999 when I visited the Astronaut Office at Johnson Space Center and\nsaw a sign that read,\" Expedition Corps.\" I asked, \"What is this?\" Andy Thomas\nresponded, \"Well, it's for the people who are planning to go to the International\nSpace Station and beyond.\" I said, \"It's a stroke of brilliance.\" You have people\nalready using the mind-set that this is an expedition. It's going to be a long\ntime--it's not a test flight, it's really an expedition. It's my understanding that\nMichael Foale is responsible for doing that. [Foale replied that astronaut Ken\nBowersox (also in the audience) was responsible for the use of the term]. Well,\nit was a stroke of brilliance and should be congratulated. It's a wonderful idea. It\nhelps people get in the mind-set for an expedition.\nThere were 40 explorers with Lewis and Clark. By the way, only one\nmember of the expedition perished in the entire three years, and he died of a\nburst appendix, we believe, based on a description of the incident. Any one of\nyou who ever had acute appendicitis would probably agree with me that you'd\nwant to have that out before you go. Now, the physicians tell me that that's not\nnecessary, but, from my experience, I wouldn't want to have that condition a long\nway from home. The Lewis and Clark Expedition was 28 months long, about the\nsame as an expedition to Mars might be.\nLewis and Clark and their company met many native peoples along the\nway. That probably won't happen on a mission to Mars, although some people are\nhoping for it, I'm sure. But one thing that they did was to describe everything in\ntheir journals. Captain Clark and Captain Lewis were meticulous journal keepers.\nI thought it might be interesting to find out what exactly they were doing\non the 27th of September 1804--200 years ago today. I was amazed. It was the\nmost pivotal period of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Two days ago, they were\non the Missouri River, and they reached a tributary near what is now Pierre, South\nDakota. They had finally encountered the Teton Sioux, who they had heard were\ngoing to be hostile to them. Indeed, it was a three-day period of intense hostility.\nThey had learned through interpreters--through other Native Americans--that\nthe Sioux intended to prevent them from going any farther and to steal all their\nstuff. The two preceding days were just incredibly tense.\nOn the 27th, they were trying to leave the village, and the little boat that was\ntaking them out to the larger keel boat had lost its anchor and was having trouble\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nmaintaining its position. The little boat came out and parted the remaining cable,\nand there was a lot of hollering to get the people to their oars and so forth, and\nthat alarmed Black Buffalo on shore, so he called all 200 of his warriors out to the\nshore. Lewis and Clark believed for sure that this was going to be the showdown.\nThey went to stations--Clark went to the bow and manned the swivel gun, a\nlittle two-inch cannon loaded with shot. They had something like 20 men with\nblunderbusses loaded with shot trained on the main body of the group. They\nhad a technological edge here. They would have wiped out 40 or 60 of the Teton\nSioux, but there's another 200 of them in arrow shot, and they could keep an\narrow in flight at all times, and it's a long time to reload the weapons on board\nthe keel boat.\nThere was this standoff for we don't know how long, but it appears to\nbe quite a while, with Clark in the bow shouting, the interpreter, who really\ndidn't speak Teton Sioux, trying to convey to Black Buffalo to control his people\nbecause there were warriors who were coming into the water, who were grabbing\nhold of the mast of the little boat to keep it ashore. They thought for sure that\nthis was the incident that they had been fearing. What Clark didn't realize was\nthat his people obeyed him because it was a military organization. The Teton\nSioux were only recently a tribal organization. It was a group of bands that came\ntogether when the resources permitted. Black Buffalo's control over the 200 or\nso was based on his charisma--only a quarter of them were related to him and\nhad some obligation to obey him. But Clark took a risk that if he held his ground\nand didn't fire, it would be resolved peacefully. And the decision paid off. Finally,\nBlack Buffalo pulled on the arm of one of the guys and apparently told him to\nback away, and the Corps of Discovery was permitted to go.\nOf course, the Sioux dogged them all along the way, trying to get them\nto come ashore or to take them on board, which Lewis and Clark didn't do. I'd\njust like to read a sentence or two from the journal entry for this day 200 years\nago. \"We were on our Guard all night. The misfortune of the loss of our Anchor\nobliged us to lie under a falling bank, much exposed to the accomplishment\nof their hostile intentions . . . Our Bowman, who could speak Maha, informed\nus in the night that the Maha prisoners informed him we were to be stopped.\nWe showed as little signs of this Knowledge of their intentions as possible. All\nprepared on board for anything that might happen. We kept a Strong guard all\n\"\n\"\nONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE LEWIS AND CLARK\nEXPEDITION IS TO ESTABLISH A SPIRIT OF THE EXPEDITION . . . IT HELPS\nPEOPLE GET IN THE MINDSET FOR AN EXPEDITION.\n\"\n\"\nJACK STUSTER\nBOLD ENDEAVORS\n\nnight, no Sleep. Captain Clark, 27 September 1804.\" Just south of the Mandan\nvillages is where this all occurred 200 years ago today.\nThe lessons applicable to the future? The importance of good leadership.\nPrevious studies found that good leadership is actually more important than\ngood habitability. Plan everything. Have a sense of cooperation and perseverance.\nTo the extent possible, live off the land. Now, you won't be able to hunt buffalo\non Mars, but you will be able to use the resources on Mars in the same manner to\nextend your reach. And, of course, develop a spirit of the expedition, symbolized\nby the Corps of Discovery.\nAnother expedition that everyone knows about is the voyage of the Beagle.\nIt was really a British surveying expedition, the purpose of which was to chart\nthe coastline of South America. Captain Robert Fitzroy was--I can't think of a\npolite word to use--a very stern and narrow-minded person. He at first didn't\nwant the volunteer naturalist, Charles Darwin, on board, because he didn't like\nthe look of his nose. And then later, off of the coast of Argentina, Darwin had an\nargument with Fitzroy and almost abandoned ship, because Fitzroy thought that\nslavery was a noble institution and had a lot going for it and Darwin thought it\nwas disgusting. And, so, at their next port, Darwin spent several weeks on shore\nuntil he cooled off.\nDarwin wrote in his journal about the crowded conditions on board a\nresearch vessel. So many chronometers and so many people packed into small\nspace. It was a very difficult journey for him. Darwin, after this five-year voyage\nand returning to England, lived to be a very old man. But he never again set foot\non a boat, never again left England.\nOne of the most relevant expeditions is the Belgian Antarctic expedition\nof 1898-1899. It's relevant not just because it was the first expedition to winter\nover in Antarctica, the first expedition to really have science as its true objective\nin Antarctica, but because it was a multinational crew, cosmopolitan, and, in\nthis regard, truly modern. It included Norwegians, Romanians, and, of course,\nBelgians. They had the very best of all French food, and one American, Frederick\nCook, the ship's physician.\nWhat happened on board the Belgica is well-documented. The crew gradually\nslipped into a malaise that was paralyzing to some of them. One man died because\nof what Cook thought was the effects of the isolation and confinement. One man\ndeveloped a temporary deafness. Another man developed a temporary blindness.\nOne man, each night, would find a place below deck where he could hide and\nsleep, because he thought people were going to kill him. Roald Amundsen served\nhis apprenticeship as an explorer as mate on the Belgica, and later wrote, \"Insanity\nand disease stalked the decks of the Belgica that winter.\" He credited Frederick\nCook with saving the expedition from certain psychological collapse.\nCook saw what was happening, and he thought that there was this heavy\npsychological component, but he also thought something was missing from their\ndiet. This was before vitamins had been discovered, but he figured there was\nsomething missing. He tried to get the men to eat fresh penguin meat, but it\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\ntasted too fishy for many of the men. So, for those who were the most afflicted\nby this malaise, he would have them stand with nothing on except an overcoat\nexposing their naked skin to the glow of the ship's stove. He called it the baking\ntreatment. They'd stand there for as long as they could each day, taking turns\ndoing this. Whether it had some effect on them, or maybe it was a placebo effect,\nit did have the effect of helping the crew get through this very difficult period.\nCook also thought that exercise would help, so he required the crew to take walks\non the ice, but this devolved into a circular path around the ship that became\nknown as the \"madhouse promenade.\"\nIt was a dismal time, and it appeared when the spring came that they were\nnot going to be able to release themselves from Antarctic's icy embrace. They\nworked very hard with ice saws and explosives and finally did break free, because\nthey knew that they couldn't survive another year.\nThis is not to say that people haven't survived isolation and confinement\nbefore; many have. There were often several hundred whaling ships locked in the\nice at any given time in the north during the 19th century. It is well known that\nduring the height of the Cold War, there were 10,000 American submariners, at\nany given moment, at sea, in isolation and confinement.\nRegarding the Australasian-Antarctic Expedition and Douglas Mawson,\nI formerly neglected the Australian contribution to exploration until my dear\nfriend, Desmond Lugg, showed me that it was just a characteristic American\nnarrow-mindedness to focus on certain things and disregard the rest. I rectified\nthat situation by reading as much as I could about this expedition and about\nMawson. There is a tremendous wealth of information that we can extrapolate\nfrom Mawson's experience. For one, personnel selection is important, and, for\nanother, weather influences everything. It'll interrupt your plans. It will break\nequipment and keep you from doing things that you want to do. If you don't think\nthat's relevant to the future, ask Michael Foale, who had on several occasions to\nretreat to the hardened portion of the International Space Station when there\nwere solar events, solar weather. Also, on Mars, there will be similar solar events\nand solar particle events and also dust storms. Dust storms on the planet Mars\ncan envelope the entire planet, and that would affect an expedition.\nRoald Amundsen was the most successful of all explorers; he always made\nit to his destination. First to the Northwest Passage. First to the South Pole. In\n1923 he was on two Dornier flying boats to fly over the North Pole. One of them\ndeveloped problems and had to land. It crash-landed. The other one landed. They\nspent two weeks on the ice, leveling with wooden spoons an airfield for them to\ntake off. Amundsen structured every moment of every day. The hours of work, the\nhours of eating, the hours of sleep, the hours for talking, for smoking, everything.\nHe was in charge, and he made himself known to be in charge and organized\neverything. When they returned to Norway two weeks later, of course everyone\nthought he had died in the ice, and it was a wonderful welcome. Amundsen later\nperished in the North while looking for Umberto Nobile, a guy who he devoted\nhis biography to criticizing. I work in the field of human factors, and I'm grateful\nJACK STUSTER\nBOLD ENDEAVORS\n\nto Roald Amundsen for his wonderful statement, \"The human factor is three-\nquarters of any expedition.\"\nErnest Shackleton is probably the best known of all the explorers. There\nare movies about him, books about him, and seminars at corporations to impart\nthe style of leadership that he had developed. His recruiting ad from a London\nnewspaper read, \"Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold,\nlong months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honor\nand recognition in case of success.\" Now, this might\nhave been a personnel selection measure on his part,\nbecause I truly believe he thought he was going to\nreturn, but he wanted to make sure that everyone who\nembarked with him would be aware of the risks.\nShackleton had very clever ways of selecting\npeople not so much on their technical expertise, but\non how well they got along with their colleagues. He\nwould ask them impertinent questions, and if they\nresponded defensively, that might not be the kind of\nperson that you really want in your tent eight months\ninto a bad situation. But if they were humorous\nabout it or philosophical about it, the person might\nbe okay. Although Shackleton never made it to any of\nhis destinations, he never lost a man. On the British\ntrans-Antarctic expedition, the Endurance was locked\nin the ice, and [the] crew spent months on board,\nand then several months in a camp next to the ship\nas it was sinking. Then they moved to a camp that\nwas on an ice floe that was as large as they could see,\nbut, gradually, as the winter ended, the ice floe was\nbreaking up around them. It was a mile across. Then\nit was several hundred yards across. Then it was 100\nyards across. They had been practicing their egress\nto the boats. They had saved lots of equipment and\nthree cutters from the ship. They had everything in\nthe boats and they had practiced many, many times to escape the floe. It started\nto break up beneath them. It actually broke up right in the middle of the camp.\nShackleton dramatically rescued one of his crew members from the ocean, pulling\nhim onto the ice, and they departed. Then, they spent a week in these open boats\nin the worst sailing conditions on the planet, before they made it to a tiny rock\ncalled Elephant Island, where they made it ashore.\nShackleton knew that they could not survive there very long, so he selected\nfive men to accompany him on the most arduous and dangerous open-boat\nvoyage probably ever undertaken, to get to a whaling station on South Georgia\nIsland. He took some of the people with him because he needed their skills, but\nhe took some of the five people with him because he didn't want to leave them\nErnest Shackleton. (Source: Shackleton, E.H. The Heart of\nthe Antarctic, Volume I, 1909. p.234.)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nthere. They were the malcontents that might have made things really bad for the\nfolks who were going to be confined to the huts they made from the overturned\ncutters on Elephant Island. He eventually made it to safety. They made five rescue\nattempts, finally getting to Elephant Island with a borrowed tug from the country\nof Chile. It is a wonderful story.\nI want to talk just for a moment about Richard Byrd, because he's American\nand one of the few of the American polar explorers that I consider relevant.\nOn his 1934 expedition, Byrd built Advance Base, a 9 by 13 foot hut that was\ntransported 100 miles from Little America and buried in the snow. It was going\nto be his experiment in isolation and confinement. Originally, he intended to\nhave two people live there, but wrote later that he didn't want to subject anyone\nelse to the risk. He considered the primary source of risk to be the psychological\nrisk of being alone in complete darkness. Well, he really shouldn't have done\nthis, because he almost killed himself three different ways. He fell and injured\nhis shoulder even before the party that had delivered him had departed. He was\ncontinuously poisoning himself from the exhaust from the gasoline generator\nand from the fumes from a poorly vented stove. He almost froze to death when\nhe locked himself out of the cabin in a storm--that was poor human factors\npreparation, the latch on the door.\nBut the crew at Little America knew that something was wrong several weeks\ninto this experiment when his Morse code transmissions were the equivalent of\nslurred. They mounted three different rescue missions before they got to him,\nand he was in terrible shape. He survived to write one of the most eloquent\naccounts of life in isolation and confinement at its worst in the book Alone, in\n1938. \"Time was no longer like a river running, but a deep still pool,\" he wrote. He\nalso said that \"a man who lives alone lives the life of a wolf.\" That is, his manners\nleft him, which is something that happens in isolation and confinement\nThe Norwegian Polar Expedition is one of my favorites and the expedition\nfrom which we can derive the most benefit. Fridtjof Nansen would have had a\nwonderful career in modern times, either as a rock musician or an actor. But he\nwas a scientist. He was one of the founders of the modern theory of neurology.\nHe was one of the popularizers of skiing as a sport. He had skied across Norway\nfrom Bergen to Oslo. Skiing was not a sport at the time, it was something rural\npeople did to get around.\nIt is difficult for us to appreciate what the world was like during the closing\nyears of the 19th century. We take for granted a communications network and\ntravel abilities that allow us to reach anywhere in the world. But in 1893, there\nwere still many unknown regions and many unanswered questions of the natural\nworld, and the most compelling was, \"what is at the North Pole?\" Is it land? Is\nit ice? Is it open ocean? There were fanciful predictions. And many people had\nperished trying to find out.\nNansen had a plan. There was some evidence that the polar ice pack moved\nacross the top of the world from east to west. So he thought: if a ship were built\nproperly, it could be locked in the ice on purpose, and then you could allow nature\nJACK STUSTER\nBOLD ENDEAVORS\n\nto carry you across the top of the world. He had a plan for a ship which he called\nthe Fram. \"Fram\" means \"onward\" in Norwegian, and it was his personal motto.\nHe approached the Norwegian government with this plan and received a grant.\nHe had to go back, not unlike modern expeditions, because of cost overruns for\nbuilding in an additional margin of safety.\nDuring a time when crews were separated--with the\"men,\"or crew, sleeping\nbefore the mast in the forecastle, and the officers and scientists in the main\ncabin--Nansen designed the Fram so that all staterooms opened onto the saloon,\nor the main area, a perhaps characteristically egalitarian, Norwegian approach.\nIt was a very stratified society, but he did this to encourage comradeship and\nfacilitate habitability. Nansen tested everything beforehand. There were spinoffs\nfrom his expedition. Polar travelers still use the Nansen Cooker, because it\nextracts the last calorie of energy from fuel.\nThe Norwegian Polar Expedition provided a model for all future explorers.\nThe Fram sailed up the coast of Norway, across Siberia, and at a point closer to\nAlaska than Norway, headed into the pack ice on purpose. The ship was built\nwith a rounded bottom and a recessed keel. Every fitting could be removed so\nice could not get a purchase on this ship. When the ice encroached, and the\npressures increased on the hull, the ship rose up out of the ice and remained\ncradled in that manner as she drifted across the top of the world. The theory was\nproved, and when it appeared they would get no farther north, Nansen selected\none man, Hjalmar Johansen, to accompany him on a dash to the pole.\nAfter many weeks, they found that they were only making a mile a day. So,\nat the closest that anyone had reached to the North Pole at that time, they turned\nback. They had no hope of regaining the Fram. They made it to Franz Josef Land\nwhere they were caught by an early winter.\nNansen knew that the secret was to keep people busy with meaningful\nwork, and, of course, to be especially careful about the food. Norwegians are\nnot afraid of the cold. They say there is no such thing as bad weather, only bad\nclothing. And he also knew that it was important to keep people entertained.\nThe crew looked for every opportunity to celebrate. After awhile, they actually\nwent into their almanac to find other countries' holidays to celebrate. Special\ncelebrations break the monotony and help motivate a crew.\nNansen and Johansen built a 6 by 10 foot hut out of stones and walrus\nhides. Their entire world was illuminated during that Arctic winter by the pale\nglow of a blubber lamp. They had nothing to do. They slept sometimes as many\nas 20 hours out of the 24, in the same sleeping bag, because it was the most\nefficient way to conserve heat. But they never resorted at any time during their\nnine months to any sort of conflict or harsh words. This was the first thing that\nthe press asked them when they got back. How did you survive?\nThey burst from their hut in the spring and performed every task that\nwas required of them expertly, despite the mind-numbing sameness of the nine\nmonths that they had endured in isolation and confinement. They couldn't clean\nthemselves. They had no towels. They didn't have a change of clothes. They\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nwould take their knives to scrape the soot that came from the blubber lamp that\nheated their food and illuminated their hut. They would scrape the blubber off\nand back into their lamps, recycling the fuel. It was incredible. Their dreams were\nfilled with clean clothes and Turkish baths.\nNansen and Johansen came upon a British expedition within a month\nafter leaving their hut, and they stayed there for another month or so until that\nexpedition's relief ship came. The day that they stepped foot on Norwegian soil,\nthe Fram broke loose from the Arctic pack ice on the other side of the world, then\nmade its way back. The crew was united and sailed together around Norway and\nup Christiana fjord to what is now Oslo. They were greeted as if they had just\nreturned from another planet. It's hard for us to imagine what it was like 110 years\nago, but the similarities to the feelings that we would have are certainly there.\nThis artist, explorer, neurologist, oceanographer, champion skier, and\nfounder of Norway was instrumental in the League of Nations. He received the\nNobel Peace Prize for saving hundreds of thousands of lives from the Armenian\nsituation, and also helped with a famine. The new Soviet Union after World\nWar I wouldn't recognize the Red Cross. Nansen was respected throughout the\narea for his experiences, and organized a relief effort, when he found that there\nwas a famine underway, while helping to repatriate prisoners of war. Presently,\nthere are people in Eastern Europe who hold what is called a Nansen passport for\ndisplaced persons. His legacy is wonderful.\nThere is much to learn from the past that is applicable to the future. I have\na lot to say about that, but I am out of time. The main themes to emerge from my\nresearch are: Certain problems are highly predictable, but they can be mitigated\nby taking the proper precautions. One of the most important findings is that\nhumans can endure almost anything.\nMy work has focused on the behavioral and human factors issues, and I\nperformed a content analysis of diaries that were maintained by the leaders and\nphysicians at French remote duty stations on tiny islands in the south Indian Ocean\nand at the Dumont d'Urville station in Antarctica. Engineers have been asking\nthe behavioral sciences for many years, \"What's the most important behavioral\nissue? Is it privacy and personal space? Is it sleep? Is it group interaction? What\nis it?\" Psychologists and others would say, \"Well, group interaction.\" \"Well, how\nmuch more important?\"\"We don't know.\"\nI used content analysis to help answer the engineers' questions. The\nmethod is based on the assumption that the more someone writes about a topic,\nthe more important it is to that person. I found that group interaction received\nalmost twice the number of category assignments as any other category. The\nstudy resulted in the first rank ordering of behavioral issues based on quantitative\ndata. I also found a decline in morale during the third quarter of an expedition;\nwhether it is a 5-month mission or a 12-month mission, there is a drop, in effect.\nInitially, I thought, isn't this an interesting and useful discovery. Then I started\nto realize that it applies to almost everything. Think of a semester in college:\nyou're only three-fourths of the way done and there is all that work yet to do, and\nJACK STUSTER\nBOLD ENDEAVORS\n\nI've only got three weeks remaining. I think it applies to many situations in addition\nto isolation and confinement.\nThere are some specific lessons. One of them is to design for redundancy, as\nNASA does so well, and also for maintainability. There is no substitute for having\nCaptain Lovell on board to take duct tape and fabricate a solution to a problem. One\nshould expect casualties. Don't consider it out of the question. Also understand\nthat weather will affect everything. The conditions will be different, but most of the\nproblems that will confront future explorers will be the same problems that were\nconfronted in the past. It won't be the gasoline-powered generator or the poorly\nvented stove that Byrd encountered, but some other similar situation.\nWe have embarked on a new age of discovery already, and there is much more\nin store for us--wonderful things.\nOne of my favorite quotes is from Arthur C. Clarke, who is one of the most\nprescient people on the planet. He invented the PDA for 2001: A Space Odyssey. He\ninvented the communications satellite, as we all know. His words inspire me. Every\ntime there is a visible pass of the International Space Station over my house, I am\nout on my roof watching it. \"Every age has its dreams, its symbols of romance. Past\ngenerations were moved by the graceful power of the great windjammers, by the\ndistant whistle of locomotives pounding through the night, by the caravans leaving\non the Golden Road to Samarkand, by quinqueremes of Nineveh from distant Ophir\n. . . Our grandchildren will likewise have their inspiration--among the equatorial\nstars. They will be able to look up at the night sky and watch the stately procession\nof the Ports of Earth--the strange new harbors where the ships of space make their\nplanetfalls and their departures.\"\nI could find lots and lots of quotes about taking risks. There are hardly any\nabout not taking risks, which might be telling. Of course, we heard earlier about\nAdmiral Zheng, whose armada of more than 300 ships in the early part of the 15th\nCentury sailed from China all the way to Africa. The flagship of his armada was\nmore than 300 feet long. Compare that to state of the art 1492 [European] naval\ntechnology. What would history have been like had the Emperor not had all the\nships burned and made it a capital offense to build a ship with more than two masts?\nWe might all be speaking Chinese now. I'm not sure. It's important, sometimes very\nimportant, to take risks, because the costs of not taking them can be greater than\ntaking them.\nI want to end on a more cheerful note. My favorite philosopher, Mark Twain,\ncommented on more than the weather in San Francisco in the summertime. He also\nsaid \"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't\ndo than by the ones that you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the\nsafe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.\"\n■\nBack to Contents page\n\nDi\ni\nscuss on\nMILES O'BRIEN: We have a little bit of time left, and I just wanted to open it up. Raise your\nhand if you have a question.\nQUESTION: The question I have for both Jim Lovell and Jack Stuster is: It seems to me one\nof the key differences between the explorations which you have studied so much and space\nexploration is something that you touched upon, that is, the relationship between the leader\non site and the team at Mission Control. That, to me, seems to be a big difference between\nthe polar missions where the leadership of one person on the ice meant everything and\nspace missions which, ultimately, like it or not, will be second-guessed. What is the best\nway, as NASA plans missions of great length, to work that out so you don't end up with a\nSkylab mutiny-type situation?\nJAMES LOVELL: Well, let me answer that question in this manner. In the early days of our\nspace exploration, as many of our audience knows, the people who designed the work to\nbe done on the spacecraft, sitting back at a desk and thinking of what to do, often had an\noverabundance of things to do until you got into the spacecraft. When you were actually\nworking in zero gravity and you had the ability to adapt to that zero gravity, you were\noverburdened with things to do at the beginning. So, the people on the ground have to\nrealize what the conditions are in the spacecraft to be able to accomplish the tasks that you\ngive the crew. In the early days, this was a lot of times not thought about until the crews\nsort of rebelled and went back to the controllers or mission planners and said, \"Look. Here's\nwhat we can do, and here's how we have to stretch out the agenda.\"\nJACK STUSTER: You're right. The early explorers, of course, had no way of communicating\nwith their base of operations. And, even when it became possible, some didn't take advantage.\nFor example, Shackleton could have had a [radio] transmitter on board the Endurance--he\nchose not to, because he didn't want to have that connection. And I've discussed this issue\nwith Claude Bachelard of the French polar program, and if he had his way, he wouldn't have\nmuch communication at all with home, only the most necessary things, because of the\npotential for problems. In that list that I mentioned very briefly of the behavioral issues,\nnumber one is group interactions. Number two was outside communications. And most\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION:\nQUESTION:\n(NASA Image # S65-28689)\nof it had a negative valence to it. So communications is definitely an issue, but\nNASA is doing an awful lot in that regard.\nThe Life Sciences folks at NASA Headquarters have sponsored a great deal\nof research just on this very issue of communications between on-orbit crew\nand Mission Control. I watch every morning NASA TV, and the relationship\nthat Mission Control folks have with the International Space Station crew is\nwonderful. It just seems terrific, and it goes both ways. The crew learns how\nto deal with Mission Control, and Mission Control learns to be sensitive to the\nspecial issues of the crew as well.\nMILES O'BRIEN: Of course, on Mars you'd have a 40-minute roundtrip for\ncommunication. That would probably complicate things a little bit. It would be\nmore like e-mail.\nI just recently downloaded the Saturn I user manual that the Skylab\nguys referred to, and it says the specification for reliability on the Saturn 1B\nsystem was only 0.88. Now, with the Shuttle and how we've gone towards the\nall nines or five nines (.99999), where do we look at the boundary of reliability,\nwhich you were talking about in your discussion?\nJAMES LOVELL: Well, it's tough to answer that. I think a general assumption\nthat whenever we design any component, whether it's a booster, a spacecraft, or\na segment of something, we try to get the greatest reliability. We try to man-rate\nthe system so that we can have reliability on the system that we're going to use.\nNow, I don't exactly know what all the percentages are of the various items that\nwe've used over the years. But I would assume that in our present operation,\nand in the future work on some of the new vehicles that we'll design, that is\none of the greatest concerns and greatest pushes that we will try to do, is to get\nthe greatest reliability. And we do that again, as both of us talked about, with\nredundancy, and the reliability of the components themselves. And we learn a\nlot, by the way, by past experience. I didn't mention that, but Apollo 14 took off\nwith a lot of things changed to it based on the potential that 13 had. They looked\nat all sorts of things before they launched Apollo 14, in about a nine-month cycle\nbefore they could relaunch it.\nI think there is a critical point, that is, evaluation of risk could be\napproached objectively by a variety of techniques, and you can try your damnedest\nto reduce that. But at some point someone has to make a decision--.88 or .89,\nwho makes the decision and on what basis do they make the decision? Is it\nsubjective, objective, a democratic vote? How do you do that?\nJAMES LOVELL: I'll answer again. The decision is made on, what is the reward?\nI've mentioned that critical thing on Apollo 8. The Americans thought, our NASA\nfolks thought, that the reward during Apollo 8 was well worth the risk, whereas\nthe Soviets thought that maybe they should send another unmanned spacecraft\nbefore risking a new cosmonaut. And, so, you had to look at the reward. If the\nOPENING PHOTO:\nView of the flight director's console in the\nMission Control Center, Houston, Texas,\nduring the Gemini 5 flight in 1965.\n\nDISCUSSION\nMILES O'BRIEN:\nMILES O'BRIEN:\nQUESTION:\ntheir\nreward is tremendous, then we have to accept a tremendous risk that is involved\nwith it. Like any other risk factor, if you invest a lot of money in something,\nyou have to think that that's well worth the risk to invest that money to get the\nreward back. And it's the same way with almost any operation that we do. That's\nthe way I look at it.\nMILES O'BRIEN: Jack, just to follow up on that, to what extent did the polar\nexplorers get specific about the risk? Or was it just all a gut feel?\nJACK STUSTER: It wasn't a mathematical exercise, that's for sure. It was highly\nsubjective. But it is a personal equation, and some people are willing to accept\nmore risk than others, and it all depends on what the potential benefit is. If the\npotential benefit is great, then we were justified in taking a greater risk.\nWould Shackleton and Amundsen have been good astronauts?\nJACK STUSTER: I think so. They would have been good mission managers, because\nthey attended to every detail. For them, there was very little risk, because they had\nalready attended to every detail, unlike others who didn't. But, if you attend to every\ndetail, if you had planned for every possible contingency that you can think of that\nmight occur, reasonably, there's a certain confidence in your ability. It's not really\ntaking a risk. The risk is something out of the ordinary, the weather, something that\nmight come up that you can't really count on. And then, you compartmentalize it,\nand it's okay to deal with it.\nAny other questions out there? Yes, go ahead.\nMy question is, how do you evaluate the reward? And, just as an\nexample, think of Cortez and Pizarro, they would have thought that\nexpeditions to the New World were accomplishing great benefits for Spain, but\nwe see them as genocidal, wiping out great cultures. How can there possibly be\nan objective measure of reward or benefit?\nJACK STUSTER: Well, I think if we encounter other living beings of some sort, or\nsome other entity, that would be a parallel. But, if it's a matter of science, then you\nmeasure the actual importance of your discovery, and it becomes, again, a subjective\nthing. I think astrophysicists and astronomers might be more inclined to take\ngreater risks than geologists to rescue the Hubble [Space Telescope]. I think it is a\npersonal equation. Am I wrong? Well, what I mean is, if the outcome is important\nto the individual or to a discipline, then those people are likely to take greater risks.\nBut no one wants to make a rash move, however motivated, however wonderful the\nbenefit might be. He wants to make sure that everything has been covered that can\nbe beforehand, to minimize the risk. But the very nature of exploration makes it\nalmost impossible to predict what you will get in the way of benefit.\nMILES O'BRIEN: The very nature of exploration makes it impossible to predict\nwhat you will retrieve.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION:\nj\nMILES O'BRIEN:\nJACK STUSTER\nMILES O'BRIEN\nMiles, this may be as much for you as the panelists. We have an\ninteresting juxtaposition of risk taking this week. Burt Rutan is getting ready to\nfly on Wednesday morning. And he would argue that he has carefully balanced\nthe risk/reward ratio, and he is very proud that he's never lost a test pilot. And\nhe clearly thinks the risk is worthwhile. But NASA is often held to a different\nstandard, because it's the government somehow making that decision, rather\nthan an individual. Government has facilitated Rutan's flight, and has clearly\nsaid that if he wants to do that himself, he can. But how does the government\ntake that similar risk? Does it get harder and harder to do?\nMILES O'BRIEN: Yeah, is the bar set higher because you're a government entity?\nI think that's true. If Burt Rutan, as a private entity funded by Paul Allen, wants\nto do this, I think the level of acceptance that people have over the consequences\nof that, whatever it may be, I think it's greater. And I don't have an easy answer\nfor how a government agency can accept that same level of risk. But, the other\nside of it is, you have all these smart people in this room, and a lot of resources\nthat you can bring to bear to try to minimize that risk even more. I mean, Rutan\nhas done what he has done so far for around 20 million dollars. And what is that?\nThat's a NASA study, right? A few NASA studies. [Laughter] But, nevertheless, it\nis pennies on the dollar compared to the amount of cost and amount of resources\nthat NASA has. So, I think that maybe that allows you to accept and create risk\nwith more safety.\nJAMES LOVELL: Let me answer that if I could, because I think the classic example\nwas, President Kennedy got up in 1961 and, in his speech, he said we plan to land\na man on the Moon and bring him back from space before the end of the decade.\nNow, we had just put Alan Shepard up two weeks before, in the suborbital flight,\nhad not yet put anybody up in Earth orbit, much less thought about sending\nanyone to the Moon. So, he saw that this was a risk, because of the position that\nthe country was then in, we were behind the Soviets at that time in technology,\nand they were doing all these things. And he had to get a position where he\nthought he could make a bold move. So, he, as the President, represented the\ngovernment, represented the people, thought that we could do that particular\nob. It was a huge risk. If we failed, what would be the situation? He took it upon\nhimself as the leader to put us in that position.\nJACK STUSTER: Burt Rutan is reducing risk, it's my understanding, to win the X\nPrize. It is the weight equivalent of three people. There is only the one person and\nthen the weight equivalent of two people that are going up. So, he has reduced the\nexposure to risk by taking the weight equivalent.\nI'm trying to get one of those seats.\n: I know. [Laughter]\n: And there would be no shortage of volunteers, either.\n\nDISCUSSION\nQUESTION\n.\nor\nMILES O'BRIEN:\nfor the end of\n: After the Apollo I fire, the Nation grieved. The spacecraft was fixed,\nand it flew in a very short period of time. After your mission, there was a similar\nsort of thing. There wasn't a lot of discussion. There was some, but not a lot, of\nasking, \"Why are we doing this?\" There seemed to be a compelling thing drawing\nus out there. Flash forward to the Challenger. There was a lot of hand wringing.\nIt took a lot longer than people thought to fly again. Flash forward to Columbia\nAlthough something came from this in a space policy, it still seems to be so\nmuch more difficult to get back to what seemed to be so natural in the '60s. For\neither of you, have we lost something since then? Is there something that can be\nregained? Is there a magic phrase or something you can do that can bring that\nback, or were we just lucky at that time?\nJAMES LOVELL: Well, I think you have to look at the accidents in the context of\nwhich they occurred. With the Apollo I fire, there were problems because we did\nnot really understand the use of sixteen pounds per square inch oxygen in ground\ntests, which we learned very belatedly. The program, at the time in which that fire\noccurred, was one of intense competition. It was intense prestige in this country. It\nwas one that wanted to be continued to go on to completion. After the Apollo, as\nwe all know, nationally it was sort of like a ship without a rudder for a while. We\nhad various stages of the Space Station. We tried to figure out what to do. What I\nfirst recall is we were going to build a space station, a shuttle, and a transportation\ndevice all at one time. We found we couldn't do that. I think that a loss today, a\nChallenger\nColumbia, as compared to a loss during an intense period, is entirely\ndifferent. We watch these spaceflights take off on television with seven people\ninvolved. It is an instant tragedy when we see something like that happen. Actually,\nI lost more friends testing airplanes until the Challenger accident occurred. We took\nthat loss. As you, Jack or Miles, mentioned, sometimes you become accustomed to\ncertain risks. In test flying, we become accustomed to someone buying the farm\noccasionally, and we didn't think more about that. We try to learn what happened,\nand then we try to change the system and to improve the system so it won't happen\nagain. Now there are major tragedies. If we lose something, it is a major tragedy\nbecause it represents part of our country.\nMILES O'BRIEN: Jack, what was the media response after Scott's team perished?\nWas there a call never to go back to the Poles?\nJACK STUSTER: I don't know. I'm not sure what the media response was. There\nwas a great deal of finger pointing and probably a lot of similar response. It didn't\nstop the progress of exploration\nPeople weren't calling\nthat exploration\nnecessarily?\nJACK STUSTER: No. As a matter of fact, it was ennobled. The heroic death of\nScott and his polar party wasn't acknowledged. There wasn't the inquiry, let me\nput it that way, that resulted in the detailed list of changes that must be made\nfor the next one.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nMILES O'BRIEN: Question?\nQUESTION: In putting together a team for a high risk mission, what relative\nemphasis should be put on, on the one hand, technical knowledge/training, and,\non the other, personal qualities, like resourcefulness and the ability to control an\nout-of-control situation?\nJACK STUSTER: Does it involve isolation and confinement? A small group?\nIsolated and confined? Technical performance? You will find that people who\nare technically competent might be called upon to perform their expertise only\noccasionally, whereas if they are living in isolation and confinement, they are\nalways interacting with each other. So, the skill you should really select for under\nthose circumstances is getting along with each other, and then ensuring that\nit's the case by demonstrating it, rather than as a test, by simulations or past\nperformance. Of all the principles of the behavioral sciences, ranking them in order\nof validity, the best predictor of future performance is past performance. You find\npeople who have been successful cooperators in the past, and you have a better\nchance that they would succeed. If you are going to go to Mars, 13 Norwegians\nwith some seafaring experience would be good. Just don't pack the blubber lamp,\nright? It would be a bad thing.\nIf I could return to the question, the question was, what is the relationship of risk\nand benefit? NASA is compelled to justify the activity. Often it is the spinoffs--\nTeflon and so forth. There has been one that I have hoped for a long time. Long\nduration space exploration will result in bone demineralization. It could be the\nshow stopper. The bones become brittle in the same manner that elderly people's\nbones become brittle, to the extent that it could be dangerous to the explorers,\neither when they make their planetfall or, certainly, when they return. There are a\nlot of very smart people financed by NASA who have been looking into this issue\nto develop a countermeasure. There are people who take the mechanical approach\nof stressing the bones to trick the osteoblasts and osteoclasts into leaving the\nbones alone, and so forth. I have been hopeful that a solution would come. I have\njust learned that if this pans out, it will be the most monumental spinoff that\nNASA has ever come up with, and, certainly, will justify all previous research and\nall future expeditions and research, and that is a countermeasure in the form of\na pill to bone demineralization. Everyone has an elderly relative, a grandmother,\na mother, who fell and broke her hip and either succumbed as a consequence or\nthe quality of her life was changed. All of us look forward to a future where we\nwill live in fear of falling and breaking a hip. This countermeasure successfully\ndeveloped by NASA will change all of that and would be, as I said, worth all of the\neffort that went before and will occur in the future.\nMILES O'BRIEN: Sounds like a story to me. [Laughter]\nJAMES LOVELL: Jack, you're not suggesting we send John Glenn up again, are\nyou? [Laughter]\nMILES O'BRIEN: Okay. That's all the time we have. Great panel.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nOpen next section\n\nS E S S I O N O N E\nearth\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\ni\ni\nial\niti\ni\ni\nll\nHunt ng M crob\nCommun es\nn Dry Antarct c Va ey Lakes\nI'm going to talk about my experiences in both the\nAntarctic and in the Arctic, and I'll focus more on the Antarctic; right now it's a little\nbit more exciting.\nWe started back in the late '70s, working at some of the lakes that are in the dry\nvalleys. And this is one of the largest ice-free regions that exist there. There is a series of\nlakes with very, very thick ice cover, and nobody had ever probed these lake before, and\nlooked at them in depth, other than just taking some drills and popping small holes in them,\nand taking a soda straw approach. We wanted to look at them in a little different fashion.\nAs I started thinking about this symposium, I started categorizing the kinds of risks\nthat we were involved with over this period of time. And for us it really came down to\nmission risk, the success of our expedition in general, and personal risk, which I divide into\ntransportation to and from the research site.\nWe usually take large ski aircraft to get down to McMurdo Sound, and then to get up\nnorth we use Twin Otters. And then to get into our remote field sites, we'll take helicopters,\nor, in some cases, on some of the expeditions we've taken Soviet icebreakers around the\nl\niol\ni\ni\ni\ni\nDale Andersen has made almost 1,000 dives beneath the thick ice of lakes and oceans. He helped\ndevelop a number of techniques needed to explore the lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, including\nboth human and robotic exploration (using the first remotely operated vehicle--ROV--in the Antarctic).\nIn 1991-92, as a member of the Exobiology Implementation Team under the auspices of the U.S./Soviet\nJoint Working Group for Space Biology and Medicine, he led the U.S. field team on a six-month joint\nU.S./Soviet expedition to the Bunger Hills, Antarctica. Currently, Andersen (along with Wayne Pollard at\nMcGill University and others) has been studying perennial springs and ice-covered lakes in the Canadian\nHigh Arctic.\nDa e Andersen\nAstrob\nog st, Antarct c/Arct c Researcher, SETI Inst tute\n\ncontinent, and then taken helicopters inland and have been dropped off. We\ndon't have much control over what happens during those times. We're there for\nthe ride and, hopefully, we make it. And obviously sometimes the weather and\nthe conditions can get pretty bad along those lines as well.\nThen, we actually live and work in these remote environments. We have to\nlearn how to do both of those things--we have to learn how to live effectively.\nThat takes quite a bit of effort, if you're going to spend lengthy periods of time\nin these remote settings.\nAnd, then, it's not just living, but you also have to accomplish some work.\nDeveloping the skills that require you to do that work is also something that\nwe've had to overcome over the years. And then there is also the scientific\ncredibility from a personal standpoint. We can put all the effort into going to\nthese regions to do the studies, and if we get there, and the weather is too bad, or\nif the equipment doesn't work, or we've forgotten something really important,\nit's just too bad. And, then, we come back with nothing but our hands in our\npockets, and say, well, we had some good times. And, then, the program managers\nyell at us and don't give us any more money. The ultimate currency would be\nscientific publications. And if you don't get those scientific publications, then\nyou don't get to go back down and do that kind of work again.\nAnd, then, there is the family setting. It's always difficult to be away for\nthese long periods of time, especially when you are in a hostile environment.\nYour family doesn't know from a day-to-day perspective if you are just wandering\naround in the snow or if you're drowning underwater or whatever is going on. So\nthat's one of those long arms that's always reaching out to you.\nOver time, we've really had poor communication. And it's something that\nhas only changed in the last five or six years. Now we can pretty much have global\ncommunication on an instantaneous basis. It used to be that we just didn't have\nany; it took weeks for something to get through.\nThen there's risk to others, or assigned risk. If I'm a leader on an expedition,\nand I can send people out to do work, my level of risk assessment is different\nthan what I would expect for somebody else, depending on their level of training\nor what their experience is.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nScott Tyler (UNR) and Bob Wharton\n(Idaho State) pull Dale Andersen from\nthe water at Lake Hoare, Taylor\nValley, Antarctica.\n(Image copyright Dale Andersen)\n\" \"\nNOW WHY DID WE GO TO THESE PLACES? WE DID HAVE SOME OF THE PROGRAM\nMANAGERS WHO WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT TELL US . . . THAT WE WERE\nJUST GOING TO FIND A BUNCH OF ROCKS, AND THAT WE'D WASTED EVERYBODY'S\nTIME AND MONEY. WHAT WE FOUND WAS A REALLY LUSH, LUXURIANT, MICROBIAL\nECOSYSTEM THAT HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE.\n\"\n\"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nFor a program manager, that perspective might be completely different.\nIt's different if they've never been in a field situation similar to that, or if they\nhave any kind of mountaineering or diving experience, or some other kind of\nexperience that they understand personal risk from that standpoint. But it's\nvaluable to have experienced people in those positions.\nAgain, there are different kinds of transportation risks that I've been\ninvolved with: large aircraft, large icebreakers, even Hagglund track vehicles that\nwe can take across the ice shelves among the continental ice, and helicopters.\nAll of those have different types of risk associated with them. And then in some\ncases, like the Hagglund track vehicles, we drive those personally, so then we have\nto be able to understand how to drive a vehicle like that, keep it out of crevasses,\nand understand what to do when it breaks down, which it invariably will.\nIn the dry valleys, a lot of the ice is not in the valley itself. You have the\ncontinental ice flowing through, and you have a barrier that essentially keeps\na lot of this from going into the valley. The evaporation highly exceeds the\nprecipitation, so it's quite dry. But some of the small features in between the\nglaciers are actually lakes. One example is Lake Hoare, where we spent quite a\nbit of time studying the lake ecosystem itself. Now these lakes are permanently\ncovered in ice, and the ice thickness ranges from about 3 to 4 meters up to 6\nmeters. In earlier years, about the only way people studied these lakes was\nto go out and drill a small hole through it, and then take water samples and take\nsome other measurements. But nobody ever really asked the question, what's\ngoing on at the bottom? Because most people thought the light levels were so low\nthat there wouldn't be anything on the bottom.\nWell, a few years later, we decided to open these lakes up with\na bigger hole so that we could go down and look. I guess, for some\nreason, we weren't smart enough, or at that time underwater cameras\nwere still a hassle to get a hold of, and it was just as easy to put us in\nthe water as it was to take a little camera and drop it down the hole.\nBut that wouldn't have had nearly the fun factor, either, I guess.\nWe developed a system that allowed us to melt holes through\nthis thick ice. Essentially, we take a copper coil and just put hot\nantifreeze solution through it, let it melt down the ice. You can see\nthat we can move in and out of that ice cover, as we're melting it.\nIt's like a tunnel, of course, a water tunnel. Then we suit up and we\njump in. Originally, we started out in wet suits and double hose\nregulators, which is kind of ancient history. Over the years, that was\nobviously not the best solution, because you've got to deal with a\nreally cold wet suit once you get out of it. If it's minus 30, it's not\ntoo comfortable to take a wet suit off in those conditions. You can\nsee that we're on tether, because once you go in, you've got one way\nin and one way out.\nNow why did we go to these places? That to me was the\nbiggest payoff. We did have some of the program managers who were\nA dive hole being \"cut\" through the ice at\nLake Hoare, Taylor Valley, Antarctica.\n(Image copyright Dale Andersen)\nDALE ANDERSEN\nHUNTING MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES\n\nassociated with the project tell us, just before we were getting ready to go in for the\nfirst time, that we were just going to find a bunch of rocks, and that we'd wasted\neverybody's time and money. What we found was a really lush, luxuriant, microbial\necosystem that had never been seen before. And as it turns out, these tunnels that\nwe make through the ice are just like tunnels back through time, 600 million years\nto 3.5 billion years ago. This gives us a glimpse of early Earth, and, perhaps, of\nearly Mars. If lakes existed on Mars, they would possibly have been ice-covered,\nand possibly have microbial communities similar to what we see in the dry valley.\nThese kinds of microbial mass communities are very, very prolific.\nOur work there is very dependent upon the training that we received. We\nhave to be very safe. We're diving in extremely remote areas where we don't have\nthe opportunity--at least, at that time, in this particular area, we didn't have the\nopportunity--to get back to a recompression chamber. The closest one would\nhave been in New Zealand, and that's, of course, after a helicopter possibly came\nout, and picked you up, and dragged you back to McMurdo, and put you on a C-\n141 Starlifter back to New Zealand.\nWhen we were in other situations, we didn't have that option at all. The\nnearest chamber was probably several months away. And we worked everywhere\nfrom about 40 meters up to the water columns. We have to be very, very careful\nabout the dives that we go on, and the kind of diving that we're doing. That one\ntether that takes you back to the surface is so very important. So it's kind of like\n\"follow the light.\" But it's actually very fun diving. It's very exciting to go into\nthese lakes.\nWe also started a program a number of years ago. Because we can only go so\nfar out on our leash underwater, we really are restricted to the amount of material\nwe can see. So we started a telepresence project where we started using remotely\noperated vehicles--actually Sylvia Earle loaned us the first ROV [Remotely Operated\nVehicle] that was used down in the Antarctic in one of these lakes. A lot of the\nalgorithms that we used for one of our ROVs was actually utilized later on the Mars\nPathfinder. Some of guys in the Intelligent Mechanisms Group at Ames worked\nvery closely with us on that. Anyway, that was a very good means of getting out and\naway from that dive hole, and getting into working with other communities. We\nalso had to learn to operate this kind of equipment in those environments.\nNow we just don't follow the microbial communities underwater. We also\nfollow them wherever we can find them. That includes on top of the glaciers. We\nthen have to pick up ice climbing skills and some general mountaineering skills\nwhen we want to go up into the alpine areas. So, it's a real skill mix to work in\nthese kinds of regions.\nIn 1991-1992, I had the opportunity, along with Jim Rice who is here in\nthe audience and Peter Dorn who is in Chicago, Illinois, to go to the Bunger\nHills, another ice-free area in the Antarctic, with the Soviets. That was a joint\nexpedition between our two space programs through the Space Medicine and\nBiology Working Group, and it was part of the Exobiology Implementation Team\nthat allowed us to get together with their exobiologists.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nThree of us joined eight Russians. We traveled for two months around the\nAntarctic continent by icebreaker. We got dropped off by helicopter for the next\nfour-and-a-half months in extremely remote settings with quite a few cultural\nand language barriers. To be honest, the expedition took place at the very last\nminute because of the way programmatics worked and the way permissions go,\nand because the dialogue between the Soviets and the U.S. at the time was kind\nof slow. We didn't find out that we were actually going until four weeks before\nwe left, so we had to buy everything, ship everything, and get everything down\nto South America. Hopefully, it was all there when we got there. We actually\ndidn't open up our boxes until we, literally, got to the Bunger Hills and the last\nhelicopter left. It was a pretty quaint setting. We spent some time in some of the\nhuts that they had there, but we also spent quite a few months sleeping in tents\non the ground in the rocks. There was a great deal of wind. This is an area that\nis prone to katabatics.\nSo we had quite a few difficulties while we were there, but we also had\nto accomplish some work. All in all, it was a very successful mission, both\nscientifically and culturally. It was culturally enriching to all of us, and it showed,\nat that time, even though it wasn't a space project per se, the two space programs\nwere working closely together in an isolated, Mars-analogue environment.\nMore recently I have shifted poles, and we are now working in the Canadian\nhigh arctic. The setting is not altogether that different. It is very glaciated.\nThere are large Alpine glaciers and outlet glaciers, along with large ice sheets.\nWe're studying a series of perennial springs in this region. These are the highest\nlatitude perennial springs in the world, along with those over in Svalbard. This is\na great Mars analogue. There may have been springs on Mars coming up through\nthick, continuous permafrost. This is where we would go to see these. Again,\nthis is a very remote setting to which we take Twin Otters and helicopters, are\ndropped off and left for a few weeks or months. It's a little shorter logistics train\nup to the Arctic, so we can get back and forth much easier. Nevertheless, while\nwe're there, we are actually a little more isolated, at times, than we are in the\nMcMurdo dry valley area.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nDALE ANDERSEN\nHUNTING MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nHi\nlti\ni\ni\ngh-A\ntude Mounta neer ng\nI've been climbing now for 27 years, and, hopefully, I've done\nit the right way. I started by climbing small peaks and then aspired to climb higher and higher\npeaks. As I was going higher, I eventually realized that what I liked about mountaineering\nwas the extreme challenge and how difficult it was and, also, the beauty of climbing these\nmountains without oxygen--the pure way, the hard way. I had probably a difficult start,\nthough, in my career, being raised in the great mountaineering state of Illinois. But it was in\nhigh school that I was reading adventure books: Amundsen, Scott, Endurance, and books like\nthat. I came across a story written in 1950--Annapurna, and it details the first ascent of an\n8,000-meter peak. There are fourteen 8,000-meter peaks in the world, roughly 26,000 feet\nand above. In 1950, a French team climbed this peak called Annapurna. They succeeded, and\nit is a very amazing story. It inspired me to start climbing mountains.\nThe first thing I had to do, obviously, was to get out of Illinois, and I chose to move to\nSeattle. My other goal in life was to become a veterinarian, so I studied veterinary medicine\nin the Seattle area. I started climbing voraciously and learned from people who were very\nexperienced, very conservative, and willing to teach me their craft. Eventually, I landed a\nto date.\ni\ni\ni\nlti\ni\nEd Viesturs is America's leading high altitude mountaineer, having climbed many of the world's most\nchallenging summits, including ascending Mount Everest five times. He holds this record with one\nother person. Viesturs is the only American and one of five people to climb the six highest peaks in the\nworld--all without supplemental oxygen. He is currently on a quest to climb all 14 of the world's highest\nmountains (above 8,000 meters) without the use of supplemental oxygen. He has successfully climbed 12\nEd V esturs\nAmer can H gh-A\ntude Mounta neer\n\njob guiding on Mount Rainier, 14,400 feet, which I have now climbed 192 times.\nMost of those times were as a guide.\nI truly believe that my safety and success in the Himalayas is because of\nmy guiding experience, because, as a guide you always have rather inexperienced\nclients in tow. You are responsible for them. You always have to be evaluating\nrisk and always asking yourself, if this happens, how do I get out of that? So you\nare always trying to think ahead, or, at least, not waiting until something were to\nhappen. I truly think this has helped me a lot in the Himalayas.\nAs I was guiding and climbing higher and higher peaks, I started dreaming\nbig. Obviously, the highest peak you can dream of is Mount Everest at 29,035\nfeet. I thought that if one day I had the chance to go there, it would be an amazing\nthing. On the summit there is one-third the amount of oxygen that there is here\nat sea level. To date, almost 2,000 people have stood on the summit of Mount\nEverest. The kind of clothing that we wear is very lightweight. It's very technical.\nThe boots are thermoplastic. There is foam insulation. The fabrics we use are\nsingle-layer GORE-TEX(r), breathable, waterproof, and these products insulate\nus, but we still have to move to create body heat. We don't have any internal heat\nsource other than our bodies. Basically, these products do not help us climb the\nmountain, but they make it safer. We climb faster and more efficiently.\nMost people that climb Everest--I'd say 95 to 98 percent of the people\nthat climb Everest--use supplemental oxygen. Even with supplemental oxygen,\nit is very difficult to climb this mountain, because the oxygen is mixing with\nambient air, and you are only really reducing your relative altitude a couple\nthousand feet. It is still very difficult, but I decided long ago that if I ever had\nthe chance to go to Everest, or one of the other 8,000-meter peaks, I would not\nuse oxygen to climb these mountains. I thought it would be more interesting\nto challenge myself and to see if maybe I could get to the summit, rather than\nguaranteeing myself getting to the summit. So, that is a rule that I made long ago\nand something I've lived by.\nI had my first chance to go to Mount Everest in 1987. We were climbing the\nNorth Face. With my partner, Eric Simonson, we were part of a large team of about\n10 climbers, and it takes 2 months of climbing, setting up a series of 4 camps, and\ncarrying loads to just get into position to go to the summit. In the end, if you can\nget one or two people from that team to the summit, then that is teamwork, and\nthat's a success. So, Eric and I were making the final dash to hopefully get to the\nsummit. I was climbing without oxygen the last 300 vertical feet of the summit\nridge to the top of the world. It was kind of late in the day, and the weather was\nchanging. Eric, rather conservative, as am I--we were looking at the top, thinking\nthat we could probably get ourselves to the summit, but we probably wouldn't get\nourselves down. For both of us, that seemed to be a huge decision-making factor.\nI have always felt that climbing has to be a round trip, right?\nBut a lot of people lose sight of that. They see this goal that's two hours\naway and they've spent years of preparing and training and months of climbing,\nand when it gets to that close of a distance, they're willing to throw caution to\nOPENING PHOTO:\nThis image featuring Mt. Everest and\nMakalu was taken by an Expedition 8\ncrewmember on the International Space\nStation (ISS).\n(NASA Image # ISS008-E-13304)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nthe wind simply to get to the summit and then, hopefully, they'll get down. And\na lot of those people, unfortunately, never make it back down. For me, the risk is\ntoo great--I don't want to die going to the summit of the world. So we walked\naway--300 feet from the top. And it's something I thought about every single\nday for three more years.\nTwo years later, in 1989, I climbed the third highest peak in the world,\nKangchenjunga. We climbed by a very steep and difficult route--this is the\ntechnical climbing that we had at 24,000 feet. Very strong team, rather good\nconditions, and in the end, we reached the summit of Kangchenjunga at 28,200\nfeet on a very, very pleasant day. And if the weather's good, and you have time,\nyou can stay for about an hour on the summit. If the weather's bad, three minutes,\ntake some photos, and down you go. We stayed for an hour. Looking 80 miles to\nthe west, you could see three more peaks in the distance. And the one closest\nto the center, the large one, is Everest. And even though I was there standing on\nKangchenjunga, I was longing to be back on Everest to finish that last 300 feet.\nA year later, I did go back to Everest. And--we were making the final ascent,\n300 feet away from the summit once again. Climbing without oxygen at these\naltitudes, you go very, very slowly. You take a step and you breathe 15 times. You\ntake another step and you breathe 15 times. And then you think about taking\nanother step, and you breathe 15 times.\nBut after 12 hours of continuous climbing from the high camp at 27,000\nfeet, I then, finally, stood on the summit of the world. And to me, this was the\nmost amazing point of my career--to be on the top of the world. I've always told\npeople this is the closest you can get to outer space without actually leaving the\nground. This was an amazing moment for me.\nThe following year, I went to K2--the second highest peak in the world--\nand by all means, much more difficult to climb than Everest. It's steeper, the\nweather is worse, and only 200 people to date have climbed K2. And I went there\nwith my great friend from Seattle, Scott Fisher.\nAt 26,000 feet was our last camp before we made the final dash to the\nsummit. The shelters and tents weigh about five pounds. On K2, the higher you\ngo, the steeper it gets and the more dangerous it gets. And that's where you really,\n\"\n\"\nI HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT CLIMBING HAS TO BE A ROUND TRIP, RIGHT? BUT A\nLOT OF PEOPLE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. THEY SEE THIS GOAL THAT'S TWO HOURS\nAWAY AND THEY'VE SPENT YEARS OF PREPARING AND TRAINING AND MONTHS OF\nCLIMBING, AND . . . THEY'RE WILLING TO THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND.\n\"\n\"\nED VIESTURS\nHIGH-ALTITUDE MOUNTAINEERING\n\nreally have to be careful, and that's where a lot of accidents occur, because people\nare so focused on just getting themselves to the top, they're not even aware of the\nweather, their surroundings, and the conditions. And that's something that you\nreally have to evaluate every step of the way. And, luckily, we climbed it on the\nfirst attempt. And once you climb K2, you never think of going back.\nI also met that year on K2 another great friend, Rob Hall from New Zealand.\nWe became great friends and did many climbs throughout the world. We climbed\nEverest together several times as well as Lhotse, Everest's neighbor. Lhotse\nis the fourth highest peak in the world. And what we started to do was to do\ntandem climbing where we would go and climb Everest over a two-month period,\nacclimatize our bodies, and then, quickly, in succession, climb another 8,000-\nmeter peak in just three days. And so we could utilize our acclimatization.\nTragically, though, both Scott and Rob died in 1996 on Mt. Everest during\nthe tragic storm of May 10th. I was there with my wife. I was the climbing leader for\nthe Everest IMAX film. My wife, Paula, was our base camp leader. Our expedition\nleader, and the director of the film, was David Breashears. Very experienced\nclimber, very detail-oriented, and an amazing leader to have on this climb, where\nyou had a very difficult task in taking a 42-pound camera to the summit, doing\nwhat other climbers were doing but also schlepping this giant microwave-sized\npiece of metal to the summit as well. And after six weeks of climbing, we were in\nposition to go to the summit. We were going to go on May 9th--this was a day\nahead of everyone. We evaluated the weather conditions. The weather patterns\nweren't what we were hoping they would be and we decided to go down. Our\nfriends, led by Rob and Scott, made the decision to continue on to the summit\non May 10th and then, sadly, the storm occurred, and on that day eight people\ndied--two of them my great friends. There was nothing we could do.\nWe couldn't climb up to them fast enough; we couldn't get a helicopter\nto get up to them. And that's the thing about mountaineering. It's one of\nthe places on the planet where rescue is literally impossible, unless you send\nhumans to go do the rescuing. There are no machines and there's no other way\nto get these people.\nPart of the reason, I think, that the tragedy occurred is that people were\nswayed by the group decisions that were made. It was almost like, if six people\nare going, then ten people are going, then twelve people are going. You know,\nthere's comfort--there's psychological comfort--in groups with larger numbers.\nAnd I think people would say, \"Well, they're going, so I'm going to go.\" And then\nthey kind of just kept pulling each other up higher and higher late in the day as\nthe storm was brewing. We helped with the rescue. We quit filming and stopped\nwhat we were doing in relation to our own objectives. We helped bring some\npeople down and then, after that, we managed to pick up the pieces, and we\nwent back up the mountain two weeks later. Not in spite of what happened, but,\nI think, to show the world that you can climb these mountains and live to talk\nabout it. If you find the right conditions, and if you wait with patience for the\nproper weather, you can climb these mountains and live to talk about it. The\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nsummit is only half the trip, and the most important half of the climb is, in my\nopinion, the descent.\nI've gone on to climb more. I'm on a quest to climb the 14 8,000-meter\npeaks in the world without supplemental oxygen. And over the last 15 years, I've\nmanaged to climb 13 of them. I have one more to go, which is called Annapurna,\nthe mountain that got me into all of this. So maybe it's poetic that it happens to\nbe the last mountain on the list.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nED VIESTURS\nHIGH-ALTITUDE MOUNTAINEERING\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nl\ni\nExp or ng the Deep Underground\nI've been trying to get to Mars ever since I was a little kid. And\nmy solution to this over the last decade or so is, really, to go down instead of go out. And\nthat may be as close to going to another planet as I ever get. After we published a paper with\nChris McKay suggesting that life on Mars would be underground, we were looking for ways\nto study the sub-surface. And, of course, the most immediate and obvious thing was the\nnew information we were getting from drill holes. People were beginning to drill, through\nthe Department of Energy project, and trying to look at deep subsurface microbiology. We\ndiscovered that caves were there and that maybe they would be cheaper to get into. And so,\nafter the early part of my career working in extreme environments on the surface, I decided\nto try caving. The first cave I ever caved was Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico, which is a\nnotoriously difficult cave. And all I thought at the time was, \"Am I going to live to get out of\nthis? I just have to live to get out of this cave.\"\nBut after the pain sort of faded, I realized that it was an amazing environment, that I'd\nnever done anything in any place that was so potentially fascinating for the kinds of exotic\nmicrobiology that I was interested in as an astrobiologist. And so I realized that I could do\nl\nDi\ni\ni\ni\nini\nl\nPene ope J. Boston\nrector of Cave and Karst Stud es, New Mex co Inst tute of M\nng and Techno ogy\nPenelope Boston's areas of research include cave geomicrobiology, microbial life in highly mineralized\nenvironments, and unique or characteristic biominerals and biosignature detection. In addition, she\nis involved in astrobiology and the search for life beyond Earth. At New Mexico Tech she is creating a\nnew program, Cave and Karst Studies, in conjunction with the founding of the National Cave and Karst\nResearch Institute. She is extensively involved in educational outreach about caves and karst issues,\nspace exploration, and general science for school children, older students, and the general public.\n\ntwo things. One is, I could learn how to cave safely and I could go to these places.\nAnd I could then refocus my work to essentially tap into an entire area of biology\nand mineralogy, and the way they overlap on our planet, that had not been studied\nbefore. This is a new field, really, in terms of what we've been doing on Earth. And\nthen it was immediately applicable, of course, to the situation of life beyond the\nplanet.\nAnd, so, most of my research now is focused in one type of cave or another.\nWe tend to pick them for their specific chemical properties, so we're looking for\ncaves that have poisonous atmospheres, that are very hot, that are very cold, that\nare very extreme in some sense, so that we can look at the limits to life on this\nplanet and learn from that what may be adaptive strategies of life for other bodies\nin the solar system and, perhaps, someday beyond. So really, to write a field guide\nto unknown organisms is part of our mandate.\nI'm studying the caves that we are looking at as I'm building on the work of\nother cave scientists in the world. There are a number of really clear lessons that\nwe're learning. These amazing environments show us that caves are really not\nrare. If you have only ever been in caves as an occasional tourist in a show cave,\nyou may think that caves are a rare phenomena, but really, there are a tremendous\nnumber of sub-surface voids on Earth of all different kinds. They aren't just in\ncalcium carbonate-type environments, which are the ones that we often come\nin contact with, but they really occur in every major rock type. And this is an\nimportant lesson for trying to apply our knowledge of Earth caves to other bodies\nin the solar system.\nThere are many, many ways to make caves. And, so, one of the areas of active\nresearch that we're engaged in is, really, a set of thought experiments about how\nyou can look at the basic physics and chemistry of environments and try to imagine\nways that subsurface voids on other bodies could be formed. And, so, we're working\nthat end of the theoretical spectrum of imagining caves on other planets.\nThe type of cave that we absolutely know exists elsewhere in the solar\nsystem are what are known as lava tubes, and these are a natural outgrowth of\nflood-basalt type, quiet, flowing lava eruptions. And these things are essentially\nrivulets that freeze on the outside. The rock on the outside freezes. It's a very good\ninsulator, and then it allows the interior to remain molten and lava continues to\nflow through. Eventually, when the eruption stops, these empty out and you have\nthese beautiful tubes, and so that's a very different class of cave from the kinds of\ndissolution-dominated caves that we often think of.\nCertainly, it was known and recognized by Ron Greeley and other colleagues,\neven in the Apollo era, that a lot of structures that they were seeing on the moon\nwere lava tubes, or unroofed sinuous rills, which is like a lava tube without its\ntop. As we get ever better imaging of the planet Mars, we have seen that there are\nlava tubes scattered widely over the planet, and these are quite easy to pick out.\nOlympus Mons has this little pit crater or little pit collapse feature, a string-of-\nbeads kind of appearance. This is a direct analogue to the way we find these sorts\nof things on Earth.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nPenny Boston prepares to rappel into\nthe entrance of the immense Lechuguilla\nCave, New Mexico.\n(Image copyright Val Hildreth-Werker)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nOne of the interesting things that's been attributed to the fact that the\ngravity on Mars is much lower is the fact that the lava tubes scale accordingly.\nSo not only does Mars have enormous examples of volcanism, but it has big lava\ntubes. The biggest lava tube on Earth is about 90 kilometers long, in Hawaii.\nThat's the record-holder on Earth. But, typically, when you look at these features\non Mars, they're hundreds of kilometers long. And the diameters are equally\ngreat, so they're on average 3 to 10 times the size of the average diameter of a\ntube on Earth. So these things are truly enormous.\nNot only those places, but when we look at the radar imaging data from the\nVenus missions, you can see that there are tube-like structures associated even\nwith those weird-looking types of volcanic features that you find on Venus. And,\nthen, even Io, which is such a cooking little moon out there with its tremendous\nsulfur component, seems to have what is clear evidence of lava tubes. And my\ndream is that somebody will get a really good image of one that's made out of\nentirely molten sulfur.\nSo these are fabulous features. These are places--at least on the Moon and\nMars, although I wouldn't recommend astronauts going directly to Io or Venus--\nthat can actually be exploited as human habitat. We just finished a Phase 1 and\nPhase 2 study over the last four years for NIAC, which is the NASA Institute\nfor Advanced Concepts, looking at the far-future conceptual development, and\nlooking at ways to discover the likely enabling technologies that we would need\nto make these actually useable for structures for astronauts and bases on the\nMoon and Mars in the future.\nSo, I'm not going to talk about all the different kinds of caves because\nthat would be a several-hour lecture in and of itself. But one of the points\nthat I think I want to really press home is that cave environments are typically\nradically different from the surface. Pictures taken in Saudi Arabia by the very\nwell-known caving team of John and Suzy Pinch have shown that, even in these\nvery hot, blasted sand deserts, when you get into very large bell-shaped caves,\nthere are divable pools. And the air in these caves is near saturated humidity. So\nit's a complete change from the overlying environment, even in caves that are\nnot sealed. And, so, it's just the barrier of above and below that provides this\nradically different environment. And this is a big message for astrobiology, that\njust what might be dominating on the surface of a planet is not necessarily the\nkey to where you actually have to go to look for the life.\n\"\n\"\nIN A LOT OF THESE SUBTERRANEAN WORLDS, WE REALLY ARE THE\nALIENS, AND THIS IS AN IMAGINATION-STRETCHING EXPERIENCE.\n\"\n\"\nPENELOPE J. BOSTON\nEXPLORING THE DEEP UNDERGROUND\n\nCave environments obviously have no sunlight, so this means that any\norganisms living within them have to make their living elsewhere, either by\ndetrital organic material washing in or, in the case of a lot of the organisms we're\nstudying, they're essentially rock eaters. These guys are disaggregating the parent\nrock using things like the metabolic product, the organic acids that they give off,\nand, then, other organisms come along within these little microcommunities,\nand they oxidize the metals in the rock. And this is how they get the energy to\nrun their entire ecosystem.\nThey're very high-humidity environments. In contrast to the surface,\nthey're very thermally stable, so even a cave with a big, gaping, open entrance still\nremains very, very thermally consistent on the interior. New transfer is usually\nvery, very low, with some exceptions. They're very rich mineral environments.\nAnd then there's no conventional weather, so it very much is a very different\nplanet in the near-crustal caves than it is on the surface.\nAnd the result of all these tremendously different conditions is that\ncaves are unique mineral factories. There are vast numbers of unique mineral\nformations that are found in caves. Huge catalogues of them have been seen and\nthe explanations for the occurrence of these is very much in its infancy. One of\nthe things that we are working on extensively is which of these types of mineral\nformation processes are actually biogenic, and it turns out that there are a lot of\nthem--perhaps even most of them in caves have a biogenic component.\nSo the organisms that are actually contributing to what's going on in\ncaves are not simply passive observers or users of the environment. They are\nmineralogically interactive. They are changing the caves. They are actually\ninteracting with the bedrock and they are guiding, and in some cases controlling,\nthe kinds of mineral deposits that are left. A lot of these organisms are novel, and\nI would venture to say that the bulk of the organisms that we find are actually\nSmall white patches are actinomycete bacterial colonies growing on cave walls and precipitating\nthe mineral calcite in Ft. Stanton Cave, New Mexico. (Image copyright Kevin Glover)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nnovel. They're not known to science. And, so, from one little cave puddle to the\nnext, perhaps we have 80 percent novel organisms that we look at by molecular\nphylogenetic techniques. So these are truly evolutionarily, self-contained\nenvironments, and many of them are actually physically isolated from the surface,\nand, in that sense, they really are miniature planetary systems within our own\ncrustal environment.\nNot only do the caves house this amazing array of organisms that we're\njust beginning to understand and study, but also they're wonderful preservation\nenvironments. So if you are looking for biosignatures, then the subsurface in\ncaves is the place to look. Not only do the organisms live there, but they very often\nself-lithify. They're engaged in self-fossilization while they're actually alive. So-\ncalled U-loops from Lechugia Cave look very organic. They are entirely rock now,\nbut we have been studying their living counterparts in modern caves, and these\nare clearly the fossilized remains of microbial mats that were inhabiting this cave\nprobably on the order of four to six million years ago when this cave was actively\nforming. We can also expose the fossils in this kind of material by acid etching.\nIn a lot of these subterranean worlds, we really are the aliens, and this is\nan imagination-stretching experience. It's the kind of thing where it would be\nlovely if we could take a lot of program managers into this kind of environment,\nbecause, really, it's the kind of thing where just reading about it doesn't make as\nmuch of an impact as if you were actually doing it.\nCueva de Villa Luz is one of the most amazing caves that we're studying. It's\na sulfuric acid-saturated cave in Tabasco, Mexico. Gases from the nearby volcano,\nEl Chico, now actually come into this cave and make it an extremely poisonous\nenvironment within which to work--tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide,\ncarbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, even aldehydes, and various other noxious\nthings. And so we require complete protection from that environment.\nThe message here is that this cave is the most biologically-rich cave of any\nthat we've ever seen, and it's because of these poisonous gases. These poisonous\ngases are not poisonous to the organisms that are living there; it's home sweet\nhome. And this is the message. We're not looking at extreme environments just\nto look at extremes where organisms are just barely hanging on. We're looking\nat them to look for organisms for which that is the comfortable environment,\nbecause those are representative of what we may find as the average conditions\non other bodies.\nSo we're trying to write the field guide to unknown life, and this is a really\ntough thing to do. But the place that I've been in my career where this makes the\nmost sense to me is in these kinds of protected and evolutionarily-sequestered\nenvironments. A lot of the material we look at doesn't even look alive. We've\nseen white muddy-looking stuff on the walls--that's living mud. That material\nis made out of cells and filaments that coat themselves with calcite mineral. And\nthey're actively producing this material in caves all over the world. Tiny white\ndots on the walls are organisms that are busy dissolving the salt in a lava tube\nand making their living there. So, even though something may not look alive,\nPENELOPE J. BOSTON\nEXPLORING THE DEEP UNDERGROUND\n\nand although sometimes we have to work very hard to show that it's alive, all of\nthese environments contain amazing life forms that are busy also leaving traces\nof themselves.\nOne of the other aspects of doing the kind of cave work that we do is also\ngiving us operational experience that is very valuable to future life detection\nmissions, whether they be robotic or, ultimately, crewed teams in the future. And\nthat is that we are operating in extreme environments that are hazardous, with\nan indigenous, sensitive, alien biology. In this case, the alien biology is on our\nown planet, but, nevertheless, it's very different from our surface environment,\nand we have to take all the precautions that one would imagine in order to avoid\ncontaminating it while, at the same time, managing not to kill ourselves off while\nworking in very difficult conditions. And so, it is an analogue for operating with\nlife-detection constraints, including even the aspect of working with various\ncollaborators at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and JPL [Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory] and NASA-Langley on robotics that can get us into some\nof these kinds of environments.\nSo the caves are out there. I know that as time goes on and we explore\nthe rest of the planets in the solar system, we'll find better and better ways of\nactually detecting caves besides the lava tubes. We'll find ways to get into them.\nWe'll find ways to drill into them--which will be a lot easier than just sinking a\ncore right down into solid rock--and they will have amazing structures, amazing\nminerals, and, perhaps, even amazing life as we explore them.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nl\ni\nl\nHi\nExp or ng the Wor d's\nghest Lakes\nI am a planetary geologist, so I am revolving between Earth and\nheaven, and part of heaven is Mars. As such, I am very privileged and, also very proud, to be\npart of Mars Exploration Rover science team, which is proving a lot in terms of exploration.\nAnd, as a member of the science team, with my colleagues, we are taking intellectual risks.\nWe have been working for several years to select landing sites, and we tried to match the\nlanding sites to the objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission. We were very happy\nto see that, indeed, in many cases we have been able to reach our objectives.\nBut, although it's an intellectual risk, it's also a risk for the assets and for the time\nthat has been put into preparing these missions. There is no human life involved in that part\nof it, but still, you want to make sure that you are doing your job properly. And to do that,\nyou have to do your homework. I would volunteer right away to go to Mars. People here, like\nMr. Lovell and [Harrison] Jack Schmitt and others, made me dream as a little girl, and I knew\nthat whatever I was doing with my life, it would involve NASA, planets, and exploration. But\nstill, you have to make sure that the concept you are pushing forward is as close as possible\nto reality. And to do that, we had to do a lot of planetary geology here on Earth and to try to\nfind the best analogue we can.\nSorbonne University in Paris.\nthe limits of life on Earth.\nli\nl\nPl\nl\ni\ni\nNathalie Cabrol is a planetary geologist at NASA Ames Research Center, since 1994, and a SETI Institute\nprincipal investigator, since 1998. Her research focuses on aqueous environments favorable to life on\nMars, exploration (robotic and human), and the study of terrestrial analogues. Her education includes a\nmaster and doctorate degree in planetary geology (1986 and 1991 respectively), both obtained at the\nNathalie enjoys climbing and hiking. She also practices free diving (diving without oxygen tanks). She\nholds an (unofficial) women's world record for the highest free dive, performed in 2003 in the Licancabur\nsummit lake. Both her passion for mountaineering and diving are combined in her scientific research for\nNatha e Cabro\nanetary Geo og st, NASA Ames Research Center, SETI Inst tute\n\nI am interested in lakes. I am interested in past aqueous environments on\nMars and their habitability potential--whether those are the best place for life,\nwhether life ever appeared on Mars--these are my drivers as a scientist. And\nto try to understand that, I am exploring high lakes. Why explore high lakes?\nBecause the higher you go on Earth, the earlier you go back in time. On Mars,\nbasically, you will be going into a core environment temperature that is really low\nand you are going into a thinner atmosphere and you try to understand what is\nhappening over there. And, so, we are exploring those high lakes. We have been\nstarting in the Andes with volcanic lakes.\nAnd our goal is astrobiology, but as we were going, our exploration kind of\ncaught up with us, and we discovered a brand new avenue of research. And this\ninvolved physiology and medicine--and I'll talk a little bit more about that--and,\nof course, education and public outreach.\nWell, why go high? As I said, these are the best analogues to Martian lakes\nand we want to understand the limits of life. And why do we want to do that?\nBecause right now, the Mars exploration rover mission has proven beyond doubt\nthat Mars was a habitable planet for the type of life we know here on Earth. But\nthat does not mean that there was life there; habitability and actual life being two\ndifferent things.\nSo, going back to these high lakes is for us to understand: Is life possible\nin analogous conditions to those on Mars? So we are going up there, and we are\ntrying to start with crater lakes in the Andes, and we'll try to move on to the\nHimalayas, because as the lakes in the Andes are slowly receding now because\nof the climate change, by the same token, on the other side of the planet in the\nHimalayas, large glaciers are now melting and they are creating new lakes that are\nprobably higher than those of the Andes. This is, for us, a place to really stop and\nwitness the ecosystems forming: How life gets there and develops, et cetera. So\nthis is really something that's fascinating.\nAnd we started with the Andes and, well, you have to imagine, about two\nyears ago, myself entering the office of my branch chief at Ames and saying, \"Hi,\nChief. I think I have this very bright idea. I would like to climb a 20,000-foot\nvolcano, named Licancabur, at the boundary of Chile and Bolivia. By the way,\nit's not extinct. And there is a lake on top, and I want to dive on that lake. Of\ncourse, it's almost freezing temperature, but I forgot to tell you something, I am\na free diver. I am not using oxygen. Can you help me with Code Q [NASA Safety\nOffice]. He actually did, and this is how we started the Licancabur adventure.\nWe were talking this morning about risk and payoff. It has been the most\nrewarding experience of my entire life so far. We were blessed by the fact that\nnobody in our crew was hurt, nobody was really in significant trouble. You will\nwake up lousy at that altitude, because this is the kind of thing that happens, but\nnobody got actually sick from mountain sickness. But we had to work with Code\nQ for six months. And among the people who advised us on this trip was Peter\nHackett, and Peter was one of the other guys climbing Everest without oxygen.\nSo we took this very seriously.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nSetting up camp for the Licancabur\nexpedition. (Copyright: 2003 Licancabur\nExpedition, NASA ARC/SETI Institute.\nImage by Gregory Kovacs.)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nBut, in the meantime, as is part of exploration, you open one door and many,\nmany others open as you are walking. And so we started climbing Licancabur,\ntrying to determine if there was life up there, and as the title of our project was\n\"Exploring the Limits of Life in the Highest Lakes on Earth,\" I had never imagined\nthat that could be testing our own limits. And not only were we writing the\nexperiment, but we became part of the experiment. And this became fascinating.\nWe know how analogous these places are to ancient Mars. The pressure is\nthe same. The temperature is the same. UV radiation--well, according to models,\nwe shouldn't be very far off on this one. It's a very arid environment, yet the\ncaldera is right next to it. We're in a volcanic environment with variable thermal\ninput, and if we have questions about life on Mars, when we go to these lakes, we\ndiscover that life is thriving over there.\nAnd so, to us, that was very, very encouraging. Because this opens doors\nand potential for the study and the search for life on Mars. And going up there\nnormally would help us to understand better from the standpoint of the biology,\nbut it helps us, also, to prepare for a future mission on Mars, because we have a\nbetter idea of the type of instruments, of the type of exploration strategy, what\nwe would be able to prepare, and giving heads up to management. And this is\nvery important, too.\nOur summit camp was around 19,500 feet, and we could look down to\ntwo evaporation lakes, Laguna Verde and Laguna Blanca. These two lagunas are\nlakes which were really perennial lakes 15,000 years ago during the last glacial\nmaximum. And since then, because of climate change, they have been evaporating.\nAnd we used those two lakes, which are at 14,000 feet, as an acclimatization area.\nAnd we are studying them.\nOnce again, we stumbled into the unexpected, which is the sense of\nexploration. And as we were just hoping to spend a little time there, to prepare\nfor the ascent, then we started discovering that we had more analogy with Mars\nthan we had bargained for. Everyday at about eleven o'clock, because this is a thin\natmosphere and because you have big gradients of temperature due to the high\nvolcano, you will have huge dust devils roaming around those lakes, and they will\nengulf your tents and your refuge. And you better not be in the middle of it. So that\nalso tells us about human exploration, that there are things you must be aware of.\n\"\n\"\nAND WITNESSING MY FATHER'S LAST DAYS IN THE CONDITION HE WAS IN, AND\nTHE DIFFICULTY HE HAD BREATHING, I SAID THAT THE ONLY RISK I COULD TAKE\nWOULD BE TO HAVE ONE MORE PERSON TO SUFFER THAT THING.\n\"\n\"\nNATHALIE CABROL\nEXPLORING THE WORLD'S HIGHEST LAKES\n\nBut what we also stumbled into were stromatolites [fossilized algae\ncolonies, some of the oldest and continually surviving life forms on Earth]. And\nthe field we stumbled into is 150 square kilometers. And these are on the paleo\nshore of this larger lake I talked about, Laguna Verde, Laguna Blanca--15,000\nyears ago this was one lake. And these are fed by hydrothermal springs. And\nwe discovered those stromatolites. When we examined those structures, we\ndiscovered that they were biogenic. This means that we had blue and green algae\nforming then, and we know that these microorganisms are the ones that existed\non planet Earth. And you have to go back to archaea [single-celled organisms,\namong the earliest forms of life on Earth] to see this kind of creature.\nSo we were on the shores of lakes that are very much analogous to what\nwe are seeing on Mars, and, all of a sudden, we find those primitive terrestrial\norganisms just colonizing everywhere they can. So that's the cherry on top of\nthe cake. We were not expecting that. We are hoping to develop this aspect,\nbecause, obviously, this is going to tell us a lot about the potential of these kinds\nof lakes.\nLaguna Verde is three times saltier than seawater. I learned this the hard\nway when I tried to dive in it. Eleven pounds of lead would take me to the bottom\nwithout any problem. It was an interesting experience, an interesting dive. So\nthey are stromatolite-like colonies. Because what I didn't mention is that we\nhave all these fossil stromatolites that colonized the paleo shore of this lake. But,\neven better, there are still stromatolites forming today. And this is a very rare\noccurrence on Earth these days. We are walking on them--literally on the floor,\nand there is better news than that. I just received three weeks ago some analysis\nfrom the lab, and this is a dead ringer for [an existing species], the chemistry is\nthe same exactly.\nOur goal was the top of the volcano. And not only do you want to dive on\ntop of this volcano, but you have to get there. We have to make sure that nobody\nis suffering from hypoxia, from any type of problem. We don't want to climb\ntoo fast, because we don't want to be anoxic at the summit. And, so, what we do\nis that we stop at night at 18,000 feet, at the only flat place we can find on that\nvolcano. Basically, this is a 12 meter by 4 meter kind of flat, and we are jamming\nour four or five tents on that, with an 800-meter drop nearby. I didn't mention\nthat to Code Q before we went there. But the slope is about a 40-45 degree\nslope, on very unstable material. We can't stabilize it, and the only thing we can\nhope for is that there will not be an earthquake that night.\nSo once we are there, we spend one night there for acclimatization, and\nonce we are on top, the scenery is quite something. The lake itself is a receding\nlake now, about the size of a football field. And the paleo shore marks the level of\nthe lake in the '50s. That also tells us something: those lakes are disappearing.\nIt is really time for us to understand what is going on there, because they will be\nlost forever in a few years.\nSo when we went there, of course, we wanted to dive. We have several\nobjectives when we are doing this. The first one is to characterize the habitat and\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nmicroorganisms and ecosystem that are there. And most of the summit lake, like\nLaguna Blanca or Laguna Verde, is a very shallow lake, which means that also the\nUV radiation--the microorganisms are going to be affected by that.\nThe other thing that we are doing is to do physiological research. At Ames,\nwe have the astrobionics group, which is developing the \"sea pods\". These are\nmonitors that keep track of the team. You are monitoring your blood oxygen\nsaturation, you are monitoring your heart beat and apnea during sleep, because\nthis is happening when you are in the mountains. But the thing we wanted to do\nhere was a little different.\nI am a free diver. I never dive with oxygen tanks, because I find them heavy\nand cumbersome. At 20,000 feet I had to convince many people that it was a\ngood idea to hold my breath. But, basically, people in good health at this altitude\nwill be at about 65 percent oxygen saturation in their blood. And their heart is\npumping at around 135 beats per minute.\nWe wanted to understand what was going on with the oxygen saturation\nby doing the free diving. There are things we cannot do at sea level, because your\nblood is always saturated in oxygen at sea level. And if something happens to this\nsaturation and heart beat system, you will see it at this altitude.\nI also had another motivation--the very overarching objective is that, as\nan organism, your body is going to produce, one way or another, more oxygen,\nand we need to understand that. Because we have many people in this world who\nare dying from lung and heart diseases. And helping those people breathe better,\nor maybe find a solution that will help them, that is something that is really\nimportant to us. I took this point home because my father passed away from\nmassive heart failure a few months before the expedition. And witnessing my\nfather's last days in the condition he was in, and the difficulty he had breathing,\nCamp near one of the highest lakes on Earth. (Copyright: 2003 Licancabur Expedition, NASA\nARC/SETI Institute. Image by Gregory Kovacs.)\nNATHALIE CABROL\nEXPLORING THE WORLD'S HIGHEST LAKES\n\nI said that the only risk I could take would be to have one more person to suffer\nthat thing.\nSo, this is where, in my mind, there is no question about the risk entailed. If\nsome people wonder why we are exploring, I tell you I know why I'm exploring.\nSo, we actually monitored the free dive. And we realized that people can\nbe very well with a heart beat of 39 beats per minute--this is how low my heart\nwent when I was diving there--and getting out at 20,000 feet of that kind of\nwater, which is at 40 degrees, with a blood oxygen saturation at 93 percent.\nSomething is producing oxygen in our body. Something remembers that we are\naquatic mammals. We need to understand what it is. Nature gave me two good\nlungs (actually, Stanford is looking for the third one) and a good heart, and I want\nto take advantage of that to help make headway, to find solutions for one of the\nmost horrendous killers in our society.\nSo, this is one of the aspects of why it is worth taking risks. On the other\nhand, on the NASA-related objective, these physiological monitors tell you\neverything that you want to know about a crew's health status. It was really\nimportant for us to show that this was working, and we actually did some live\ntransmission of our vitals directly to Ames and Stanford while we were there.\nThat was the first time this was done. That was one of the co-aspects. The other\naspect, going back to astrobiology and microorganisms, is that we are actually\nnow in a position to know those microenvironments a lot better.\nIn the past two years, we have also been involved in pinpointing some\ninteresting effects of the UV radiation. For example, diatoms are experiencing\nmutation and malformation due to UV radiation. We want to understand this\nbecause it tells us something. There are, apparently, mutations that we need to\nunderstand better, if it is a mutation toward extinction or if it is a mutation\ntoward evolution. It is really important in a world where you have high UV\nimpact, such as Mars would have been in the past. The other aspect of it is that\nwe are living in a world where UV impact is becoming more and more of an issue.\nWe have trouble with the ozone layer, and if these little creatures over there are\ndeveloping sunscreen and a UV-resistance strategy, we need to learn about it,\nbecause that will help the general public.\n\"\n\"\nIT IS HARD TO THINK THAT EXPLORATION CAN BE DONE WITHOUT TAKING RISK . . .\nTHAT, ULTIMATELY, EXPLORATION CAN BE DONE WITHOUT LOSING PEOPLE ONE WAY\nOR ANOTHER. EVEN IF THIS HAPPENS, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE DONE\nEVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE THE RISK AND TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING.\n\"\n\"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nSometimes we have interesting encounters. One of a diatoms [planktonic\nunicellular algae] we found was thought to be extinct a long time ago. Well, it's\nthriving in Laguna Verde, thank you. It is having lots of success. It is still there.\nIn another case, we found a diatom that was known to exist only in the Baltic\nSea. Don't ask me how it ended up here, but it is there and thriving. Maybe the\nconditions of salinity and cold are very close to the Baltic Sea.\nSo we are learning a lot. Stromatolites were the first creatures on Earth,\nand they are still there. They are evolving and they are telling us about our past.\nIf we are able to decipher what they are telling us, we will know better about our\norigins and, maybe, possible origins of life on other planets, because those lakes\nare very similar to that of Mars.\nTo go back to what many of the previous speakers talked about, managing\nrisk and people, there is, obviously, a physical responsibility. You have catastrophic\nrisk, of course. There is nothing we can do about the volcano exploding on us if\nwe are there when this happens. Everything else we can manage.\nI would say that the state of mind I would go with when I leave the U.S.\nand go to Bolivia would be to say that, as much as I can prevent it, nobody will\nget hurt on my watch. I am always working on this, and I have to manage a very\ndiverse group of people. This group of people ranges from young people, students,\nto people who are senior scientists to people who speak different languages.\nLast year in my team I had Hungarians. I had Chileans and Bolivians. I am\nFrench. I had American people and Spaniards. That makes for good jokes when\nwe are trying to translate one thing to another. We have to make sure that the\nsafety things will get through all the time. My personal standpoint here is that\nrisk is definitely inherent to exploration, and it is necessary for discovery. And I\nwill go a step farther. I say this is also the essence of survival. If we want to do it,\nwe need to explore. We need to explore new ground.\nI guess we have to share an ultimate responsibility, as Dale and Penny were\nmentioning. You have a team with you. You are responsible for them, and you\nhave to have answers. The main thing is that you have to be accountable and\nresponsible for all that. It is hard to think that exploration can be done without\ntaking risk. It is hard for me to think that, ultimately, exploration can be done\nwithout losing people one way or another. Even if this happens, we have to make\nsure that we have done everything possible to mitigate the risk and to prevent it\nfrom happening, as much as possible.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nNATHALIE CABROL\nEXPLORING THE WORLD'S HIGHEST LAKES\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\ni\nDeep/Underwater\nCave Env ronments\nI've come from a rather unusual background in that I\ncame up through engineering school wanting to be an astronaut, but had the good fortune of\ndiscovering that there were remaining places to be explored here on Earth in the meantime.\nAs a teenager, I watched a couple of these guys who talked here this morning walk on the\nMoon. They were my heroes, and it was the U.S. space program that was directly responsible\nfor my going out and getting a Ph.D. in engineering and wanting to work in space. In the\nprocess of trying to get into the Astronaut Corps at various times, I have also had the\nprivilege of being involved with a large number of expeditionary projects dealing with things\nthat go down into the Earth as opposed to things that go up. I added it up a little while ago.\nOver the last 26 years, I've spent 7 1⁄2 years in the field on expeditions, of which 353 days\nwere below 1,000 meters deep underground, based from subterranean camps. So, I'm either\na troglodyte or somebody who's looking for planetary exploration and hasn't been able to\nget off this pile of rock yet.\nWhat I am going to do here this afternoon is to rapidly take you to three of the most\nremote places that humans have ever reached inside this planet. This is serious business.\nIt is more serious, in my opinion, than high altitude mountaineering, because of the\nWilli\ni\nl\ni\nWilliam Stone led the exploration of Sistema Cheve (-1484 meters), (-1475 meters), and Cueva Charco\n(-1286 meters), among many other deep caves around the world. These Mexican caves represent the\nthree deepest systems in the Western Hemisphere and currently the 8th, 9th, and 21st deepest natural\nabysses in the world respectively. During the past 33 years, Bill has organized and led 47 expeditions\nand has spent seven years in the field on exploration projects. He holds 11 patents and patents-pending\nand is the inventor of numerous other exploration-related tools. He is presently leading the three-year\nDEPTHX project for NASA to develop and field-test a prototype robot for the postulated Europa lander\nthird stage, the \"hydrobot\" that autonomously maps the subsurface ocean of Europa.\nam C. Stone\nEng neer/Deep Cave Exp orer and Pres dent, Stone Aerospace\n\nmultidisciplinary nature and the remoteness. I don't consider expeditionary deep\ncaving as something you do for excitement. You do it because it's an opportunity\nto explore one of the last true frontiers on this planet. The classic distinction on\nthis subject came from arctic explorer Vilhjalmar Steffanson, who once spent\nfive years working solo north of the Arctic Circle. Interviewed about this one\ntime, the reporter asked [Steffanson], \"Well, you're an adventurer, aren't you?\"\nHe said, \"Son, adventure is what happens when exploration goes wrong.\"\nI have had that motto emblazoned upon my heart in letters of gold ever\nsince. You do not get Brownie points for having your name on a tombstone. You\nhave to come back. With that in mind, I have actually taken a lot of cues from\nhow NASA trains its astronauts when preparing for, and staffing, expeditions. In\nthe subterranean world, where we are about to go, it is a gloves-off environment.\nThe exploration front is now getting to the stage where it is so remote and so\ndifficult to reach that no matter what technology we have at our disposal, and\nno matter how Olympically-trained and fit the people are who are involved with\nit, we still get stopped. Every time you go for four or five months in the field, if\nyou're lucky, you're a kilometer or two deeper into the planet. I am going to try\nto give you an idea here just what this world is like. I'm going to show here what\nwould be the equivalent of summitting Everest and K2, but it's all going to be in\none continuous trip proceeding down, in order to give you a sequential feel for\nthe logistics and remoteness.\nRising out of the southeastern area of southern Mexico is the Huautla\nplateau. It jumps straight up about 2,100 meters. The top of it is cratered with\ngigantic sinkholes. The water that rains on this area for 500 square kilometers\nall goes internally and, in the process of doing that, it creates some pretty\nsubstantially-sized voids.\nAbout 50 kilometers away to the south and a kilometer higher in elevation\nis Cueva Cheve. This was only discovered in 1986. This underscores the still\nunknown extent of this last frontier: Cueva Cheve was not even known to the\nmodern world until 1986--just 18 years ago. The endeavors we're talking about\nrequire a lot of technology, starting off with the fact that you're going down. You\ndon't just walk down that depth. There are three kilometers of specialized rope\nthat are used to rig over 107 drops and traverses going down into this cave.\n\" \"\nINTERVIEWED ABOUT THIS ONE TIME, THE REPORTER ASKED [STEFFANSON],\n\"WELL, YOU'RE AN ADVENTURER, AREN'T YOU?\" HE SAID, \"SON, ADVENTURE IS\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN EXPLORATION GOES WRONG.\"\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAn artist's rendering of the hydrobot,\na self-propelled submersible that could\nbe used to explore beneath the surface\nof the ice-covered ocean on Europa,\none of Jupiter's moons.\n(Source: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\ntechnology/images_videos/iv_pages/\np48326.html.)\n\"\n\"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nTypical vertical drops on some of these things can reach distances of 160\nmeters straight down. That would be about one and a half times the height of the\nVehicle Assembly Building, for those who are here from Kennedy Space Center.\nA lot of times they're a little bit shorter, but they almost always have water\naccompanying them. The deeper you go, the more water you collect. The tributaries\neach add a little bit in until, finally, you're dealing with quite a serious flow. You're\nrigging lines on the walls to keep out of that, usually. This is life on rope. You're\nusually carrying around a 25-kilogram pack, which has the supplies that you're\nbringing. This is very much an inverse variant to the siege tactics that you see\nused on high altitude mountains where you're building Camp 1, Camp 2, Camp\n3, and you start off with a pyramid of 50 people. Sometimes, we've had as many\nas 150, but 50 is a typical number for a trip for four to five months. That works\nout to be a good number to work with--you have depth of personnel to handle\nemergencies in situ. We've generally considered that a team of 12 to 18 is about the\nminimum you would want for safety and skill redundancy. And the further down\nyou go, you're adding more tributaries until, finally, you're into rivers by the time\nyou get to about the -800-meter level. This would be a little over a half a mile\ndeep in English units. I know nobody around here works in English units . . . except\nwhen you're designing planetary craft going to Mars. [Laughter]\nOne of the things that we've had to deal with is the fact that we are constantly\nrunning up against the limits of human endurance. Typically, if you go on a marathon\nexploration trip, you can stay up for 24, 28, maybe 30 hours, and, after that, if\nyou come back to base camp on the surface, you're out of commission for two to\nthree days while you're recovering. You can't do that underground, because even\nwhen you are resting--say at an underground camp--you are consuming supplies,\nwhich are finite and paid for at great price of effort. If you want to move efficiently,\nyour people have to be roughly 16 hours from anywhere that they have to go. And,\nso, we begin to establish a series of camps. I want to dispel the notion that a lot\nof people have that these places are claustrophobic. In reality, many chambers and\ntunnels in southern Mexico--owing to the significant tropical yearly rainfall--are\nso big you can't even see the ceilings or the walls. It really is like being on the dark\nside of the Moon. These are team endeavors. None of your specialized personnel--\ndivers, climbers, surveyors--get to the \"front\" without riding on the sweat of a\nsubstantial support team. Like high altitude mountaineers, cavers frequently refer\nto such support crew staff as \"sherpas.\"\nAgain, when I think of an expedition--and this is a sticking point with me\nand it may be with others--there are a couple of holy words in the vocabulary\nof true explorers. And one of those is the term \"expedition.\" To me, this is an\nendeavor of 20 or more people being out in the field for four-plus months. That's\na serious distinction. Anything short of that is what I would refer to as a recon\nmission. And, so, in the case I'm discussing here, you're on site for four or five\nmonths, and people are working daily. It is not uncommon during the early stages\nof an expedition for the lead rigging team to get caught between known camps,\nand, so, setting a bivouac is something you plan for as you move in. Generally, it\nWILLIAM C. STONE\nDEEP/UNDERWATER CAVE ENVIRONMENTS\n\nis for logistics reasons that you don't get as far as you would like--for example,\nyou might not have been able to carry enough rope to continue rigging.\nWell, the reinforcement crew comes in the next day with another\nkilometer of rope and off you go. And then that support crew retreats to the\nprevious camp behind them and the rigging team presses onward. And so it\ngoes on down, until you are now roughly four days traveling distance from the\nnearest entrance. So, when you get to a place like this, you begin to think about\nthe fact that you're pretty remote, and there really isn't going to be any rescue,\nexcept from the people who are with you, particularly if it's something that\nrequires urgent response. If you can get a person back to a camp and stabilize\na broken leg or something like that, you can always send out for assistance.\nBut there are places where even that is not possible, particularly when working\nbeyond flooded, underwater tunnels.\nThe most remote place that we've been so far is at the current limit of\nexploration in Cueva Cheve. When you get down to a distance of approximately\n8 1/2 kilometers inside and at a depth of -1,360 meters, you're moving through river\ncanyons, and you keep thinking that, well, this is just going to keep going down\nlike this. But the problem is that caves are always quirky in terms of geology. All it\ntakes is a slight counterfold in the limestone strata, and that river that was boiling\nis now static, placid, and leading you into tunnels that are completely waterfilled\nto the roof for substantial distances, before they usually rise back up into air-filled\nsections of cave. They used to refer to these places as terminal siphons. In fact,\nthat's the name of a rock band I'm in, so you'll hear us touring someday.\nSo, you get down to a place like this and here you are, you're roughly 1,360\nmeters vertically down and 8 kilometers in. Everything down here is paid for\npreciously by the people who transported this down. You're living on ropes for\ndays to get this here, so you have to be very careful about what you bring. At this\npoint, those in the lead--in this case, trained cave divers--have this enormous\npressure on them to perform. And I'm sure that everybody who's flown on a\nrocket knows this same feeling. Here's 50 or 100 people who have given of their\ntime, of their lives, of their sweat for four months. That's not counting, by\nthe way, in the case of many of these, that we have spent two to four months\nrehearsing with those same teams over the preceding one or two years. When\nyou get to these places where the tunnels are full of water, now you're into\nanother level of discipline where you have to be aware of the fact that, number\none, you're going to be using portable life equipment--what astronauts refer to\nas PLSS [Portable Life Support System] units for EVA [extravehicular activity].\nAnd that's the way I think of this. I think of this as EVA. And when you do that,\nyou have to be thinking a couple of things. Number one is that anything can go\nwrong at any time, and so the best way to deal with this is to believe that this\nplace is actively out to get you. When you think that way, you start making\nchecklists ahead of time. In fact, we have them all laminated on waterproof\npaper. Not only before you go in, but after you come back out. It's the equivalent\nof pre-flight and postflight checklists.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nBut there's more to this. I'm going to say one thing here, and then I'll\ncome back to another side of it. We've been talking about issues for reducing\nrisk, one of them being making our equipment \"bombproof.\" That's a bit tough\nwhen you look at the places that you have to go through to get these items\nor the equipment that these people have down here. And the other issue is\nredundancy. But before I get to that, there's this whole issue of peer pressure\nthat is on you. You have to be ready at any second on one of these things that,\nif you get 50 feet inside this underwater tunnel and you don't like how you feel,\nyou abort. That's a cardinal rule.\nSomebody was asking me recently how many people do I know on\nexpeditions that have died? And I really never thought much about it until I\nstarted adding it up. Over the last 18 years, I've lost 16 good friends. People that\nI've climbed with, worked with on expeditions, people who were very qualified.\nThe reason they're not here right now is because they went a little too far--they\ndidn't abort when they should have, they didn't stop and say, \"Wait a minute.\nThere's a stack of things that are going wrong here.\" Nothing ever happens in\none blow. Jim Lovell pointed that out this morning. But a string of little events\noccurs--you start going down there and you get tired. You get tired and you\nsay, \"Ah, I don't need to have this extra little piece of safety line here.\" And, \"Oh,\nwell, I don't need to check this other piece of equipment I have for descending\na rope.\" Pretty soon, things start to add up, and you don't have that safety\non there and when you sit down, one of those carabiners is unlocked and it\ncomes unclipped, and there you are with 25 kilos hanging below you, and you're\nhanging on the rope by one hand. You know, that kind of stuff happens. So, you\nhave to get religious in your discipline about how you deal with the technology.\nThis is high technology exploration that's going on down here. More serious\nthan a typical EVA mission outside the Shuttle.\nThe Portable Life Support System we use is all fully-closed-cycle equipment.\nThere is no air in this system. It's all helium-oxygen running at about 6,000-psi\nin carbon-carbon tanks. The range on this particular rig is about eight hours and\n\" \"\nSOMETIMES WHEN YOU GET TO THESE LOCATIONS, THERE IS NO DRY LAND,\nAND SO YOU'RE LIVING IN HAMMOCKS STRUNG FROM ROCK BOLTS ABOVE THE\nWATER AND HOPING THAT YOU'RE HIGH ENOUGH THAT, IN CASE THERE'S A\nFLOOD, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET WASHED AWAY. THAT'S THE WORLD YOU\nLIVE IN WHEN YOU'RE DOWN THERE.\n\" \"\nWILLIAM C. STONE\nDEEP/UNDERWATER CAVE ENVIRONMENTS\n\ndepth-independent. We developed this particular PLSS because we didn't know\nhow far we were going to have to explore underwater. Sometimes when you get\nto these locations, there is no dry land, and so you're living in hammocks strung\nfrom rock bolts above the water and hoping that you're high enough that, in case\nthere's a flood, you're not going to get washed away. That's the world you live in\nwhen you're down there.\nIn the bottom of this system you're doing 600 meters--that's roughly a\nhalf a mile--of diving, starting at the -1360 meter level. When we got to the\nother side, we established a camp. We were over there for a week and explored\nanother three-and-a-half kilometers beyond the underwater section. These\nplaces represent the frontier right now. No one has been able to organize an\nexpedition since to go further. In the case of Huautla, it has been 10 years since\nanyone visited that location; in Cheve, it was 2003, and it's unlikely that a return\nthere will be fielded before 2007, although we do have that one in the planning\nstages already. Neither of these places are finished. They are beckoning. They\nare wide open. And, yet, we can't get the tactical logistics together or the team,\nbecause those people all have to be not only vertical trained, they have to be\ncomfortable with where they are in a remote environment, and they have to be\nable to dive at the same time as well as climb. You start putting all these things\ntogether, all these various task loadings, and, pretty soon, the filters get pretty\nserious. There are not many people in the world who have all these skills.\nThis is the kind of thing that we are going to have to think about. Who\nare you going to put on the Moon? What kind of expeditionary-qualified people\nare you going to put on the Moon? Are you going to live together for a year up\nthere? I mean, the psychological aspects are one thing, but the multidisciplinary\ntraining is going to be phenomenal.\nIf you get away from this logistical problem that we have of getting stuff\ndown to -1,500 meters underground, and you can bring things in on tractor trailers,\nthe whole ball game changes. One of the great natural wonders of the world, just\nsouth of Tallahassee, Florida, is a place called Wakulla Springs. Up until 1987, it\nwas basically unexplored. You could look at the entrance from glass-bottomed\nboats, but nobody had seen much more than 100 meters inside on scuba. And\nwe had an opportunity to go there with National Geographic in '87. But it was\nin '99 that things really got high tech. This project was a good example of how\nexploration need drove equipment development. Many pieces of technology we\nused did not exist prior to 1999. We built all this-a floating, saturation diving,\nrecovery system; 20-kilometer-range propulsion vehicles; dual-redundant,\nclosed-cycle PLSS backpacks; and 3-D, automated mapping systems--on a two-\nyear schedule, once we got the go-ahead from National Geographic and corporate\npatrons. We had a dual closed-cycle PLSS; six onboard computers running this\nthing; twin head-up displays; 18-hours range. There is no EVA system in use by\nNASA that would meet this standard, and I'll tell you why. When we get down\nthere, we're going to be doing missions to distances of about 4 1/2 kilometers\nfrom the entrance at 100 meters underwater depth. When you're out there, you\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nare two and a half hours one-way travel time from the nearest egress point. By\ncomparison, if you're on a Shuttle mission or a station mission right now, and\nyou have a problem with your suit, whether it's an Orlan or an ILC Dover suit,\nyou've got roughly 10 to 15 minutes, maybe 30 minutes in open circuit mode at\nbest, to get back to the hatch. Here you don't have that luxury. You are two and a\nhalf hours out, and you've got to figure out how you can do it.\nIt's important to point out that everybody here was in a situation where,\nno matter where they were on that trajectory, they had an abort scenario. The\nmaximum mission duration by pre-agreement among the teams was 10 kilometers\npenetration. And you had a factor of four to one safety margin to get yourself\nback. Everybody who was doing these would rehearse each mission beforehand\nfor upwards of 12 hours (in the spring basin), and have people come in and tell\nthem, for example, that all of their vehicles were dead, they had to transfer and\nget towed out by one of their partners. And then you'd tell them, for example,\nthat half of their life support system was gone and they'd have to continue out\non that. So you're continuously rehearsing all the various abort scenarios. In that\nsense, it's no different than training for a space mission. But here, we explicitly\nincluded abort capability for every phase of the mission. That isn't true of space\nflight currently.\nA typical mission is all about collection of information about what the\nfrontier is. If you're an explorer, you should be out there trying to collect that\ndata, just like Steffanson said, and get back safely with it.\nWe built for this project a gadget--known as the \"Digital Wall Mapper\"--\nwith a very high-grade, inertial guidance unit, phased array sonar, and about\neight computers. And it's imaging the wall as you drive through, to build a\nthree-dimensional map of the aquifer. The person in back is the safety diver.\nTheir job is to make sure that when this person is driving this monstrosity, that\nif they do something wrong, they're going to come up and help them out.\nTypically, we would have a support crew follow people in to a depth of\nabout 80 meters. Perhaps 150 meters into the cave the crew is running on helium-\noxygen, and they'll have 18 hours supply down there. The people on top have got\nthe biggest sport diving cylinders in the business, and they're dumping out about\na thousand dollars worth of helium-oxygen on that support mission just because\nof the fact that they're wasting it away, breathing it into the water column.\nAnd then off you go for approximately the next five and a half hours, with a\ntypical run down here to 100 meters depth, and then you're back. Now you can't\ncome straight out, as somebody like Mike Gernhardt or anybody will tell you who\nhas done EVA. You have a decompression issue, a very serious one. In fact when\nyou're five hours down at 100 meters, you're almost saturated. At 60 meters\ndown, we had a string of closed circuit cameras following people out. They had\nflashcards so they could tell if everything was OK, or they needed supplies from\ndown there.\nWhen they reached a certain stage--the completion of their 30-meter\ndecompression stop--six support divers would drop out of the sky, like something\nWILLIAM C. STONE\nDEEP/UNDERWATER CAVE ENVIRONMENTS\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nout of a James Bond movie, and come down and take away their closed-cycle unit,\ngive them a regulator, and let them switch up into a pressurized, personnel transfer\ncapsule. They would then be transferred up to the top and into what we call a\nmini-saturation system, where they would spend the next 12 hours. Total mission\nduration, about 22 to 24 hours. We did this everyday for three days, took a day\noff for maintenance, and then did it again, for three months while we were down\nthere. No issues with safety on that entire project with any of the mission crews.\nTen million data points were gathered on this trip to build the world's first\nthree-dimensional cave map. So, in our case it's not only a desire to be out on the\nfrontier, but it's also about bringing the data back home.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nA Writer/Climber Perspective\nI've been freelance writing for 25 years, mostly about adventure,\nexploration, spinoffs to archeology and history. But before that, I was a serious climber for\nabout 20 years, from age 17 to 37. I didn't climb high altitude peaks like Ed, but specialized\nin technically difficult peaks in Alaska. And I still climb, although pretty pitifully.\nBut for me, the most critical question of my life had to do with the fact that by the\nage of 22, I had been a firsthand witness to three fatal accidents to partners. It began with\nmy first partner in high school, Dave Lee, who, only four months after we started climbing,\nwas killed on the first Flatiron above Boulder. It was not a very hard route, but when we got\na rope snagged and had to unrope, he climbed down solo to retrieve it. He slipped and fell\n700 feet, with me watching.\nThree years later, I was the first person on the scene when two guys fell out of Pinnacle\nGully in Mt. Washington, one of whom was actually in training to be an astronaut. We\ntried to resuscitate them to no avail, and then had to haul their bodies down to Pinkham\nNotch. And then, just three months after that, on my hardest Alaskan expedition to Mt.\nHuntington, after all four of us had reached the summit, on the descent, Ed Burns, the\nyoungest of the four of us, a 20-year-old sophomore in college, inexplicably fell, had a\nThe Pueblo Revolt:\npublished this month by Simon &\nSchuster in October 2004.\ni\ni\nDavid Roberts is a freelance writer living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who specializes in adventure,\narchaeology, and history. He has co-led 13 mountaineering expeditions to Alaska and the Yukon, making\nmany first ascents, including the direct north face of Denali, the west face of Mount Huntington, and\nthe southeast face of Mount Dickey. He is the author of 16 books, most recently\nThe Secret Rebellion That Drove the Spanish Out of the Southwest,\nDav d Roberts\nWr ter\n\nrappel come loose. And we were descending in the middle of the night, we could\njust barely see in the Alaska twilight. And without my knowing, even today, what\nhappened, the rappel fell, and he simply fell away from me 4,000 feet, and we\nnever could even look for his body.\nThe question to me now is, why did I keep climbing after these terrible\nexperiences? At the time, I didn't even really examine it. I mean, I came close to\nquitting, but I didn't really examine why I kept climbing. I think if somebody had\nasked me, I would have said, \"Well, wouldn't their deaths be even more pointless\nif I quit climbing?\"\nSo, when I tailed off climbing and got interested in writing about other\nclimbers, including Ed, I got much more interested in this whole question of risk,\nmotivation, and the risk-reward payoff. And, in 1980, I wrote an essay called\n\"Moments of Doubt,\" an apologia for doing something as crazy and risky and\nuseless as climbing.\nMy favorite climbing autobiography is Lionel Terray's Conquistadors of the\nUseless, because it is an awkward, but telling, phrase. And just this year, I've\nfinished a memoir about my climbing in which I actually come to the opposite\nconclusion, that maybe it wasn't worth the risk. And what changed my thinking\nabout this was that I had always thought about risk in terms of the question,\nbasically sort of a solipsistic, selfish question, does the reward I get for making a\nfirst ascent make up for the risk and the tragedy of someone dying? And it took\nme 35 years to realize that that was just a completely self-centered and, therefore,\nsort of stupid question.\nAnd one of the things I did a few years ago was to go back and recontact\nDave's brother and sister, the only surviving members of his family. Forty years\nafter the accident, and I had never communicated with\nthem. And I found that his sister, in particular, was still in\na rage with me over that accident, and that she lived with\nit every day of her life. We spent the most intense seven\nhours straight in Seattle on a park bench talking about it,\nand trying to untangle her feelings about it. And I finally\nrealized that the question of, is it worth the risk, is not one\nyou can really just apply to yourself. It really does involve\nfamily, the larger society, and humankind, ultimately.\nI guess if I still had to come up with a rationale for\nclimbing mountains, it would not be anything to do with\nthe thrill of it versus the penalties, but, rather, whether the\nvery endeavor has something inspirational about it that\nlasts. And I think by analogy with Scott and Shackleton and\nAmundsen in the Antarctic, they justified their expeditions\nin the name of science, just as I think NASA is continually\ndoing. And Scott, when he died, had 30 pounds of rocks\non his flesh, geological samples. He tossed away everything extraneous, but he\nsomehow thought the 30 pounds of rocks were worth bringing back.

The South Pole,\nVolume I, p. 170.)\n\nCherry-Gerrard's worst journey in the world was to gather penguin eggs in the\nmiddle of winter from Cape Crozier, and under the misapprehension of the now\nexploded theory that ontology recapitulates phylogeny, penguins being the most\nprimitive birds in the world, their embryos would tell us all about early human\nevolution. It's complete bunk. He performed the worst journey in the world\nto gather three penguin eggs. But we don't remember Scott, Shackleton, and\nAmundsen for their science, we remember for their example of daring adventure\nand exploration and going where no one else had ever been. To me that was the\nfirst, and is still the most exciting, part of exploration, to go where no one else\nhad ever been. The only rationale for it is if it inspires other people. Ed Viesturs\nclearly inspires other people. I have been at talks he has given where the groupies\nhave just gathered all around him. They want more than autographs. Is he a rock\nstar celebrity? No, but there clearly is something that touches the human spirit\nand, as corny as Bush's line is, \"the desire written in the human heart\" really does\nhave to do with risk and exploration.\nOne last note, a curiosity from the Renaissance. We're taught, on and off,\nabout the Renaissance, but someone calculated that on a typical Renaissance\nvoyage to the New World, sailors stood a one in three chance of not surviving.\nAnd that makes Everest look like a piece of cake. It makes Bill Stone's stuff even\nlook safer. And the collectors of the narrative of the voyages write often about\nthe adventurers, but the adventurers were not the sailors, they were the guys that\nput up the money. The real adventure was taken by the financiers who backed the\nexpedition. The sailors were just expendable work hands. All of this needs to be\nput in a historical and multicultural perspective.\n■\n\" \"\nI GUESS IF I STILL HAD TO COME UP WITH A RATIONALE FOR CLIMBING\nMOUNTAINS, IT WOULD NOT BE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE THRILL OF IT\nVERSUS THE PENALTIES, BUT, RATHER, WHETHER THE VERY ENDEAVOR HAS\nSOMETHING INSPIRATIONAL ABOUT IT THAT LASTS.\nBack to Contents page\n\"\n\"\nDAVID ROBERTS\nA WRITER/CLIMBER PERSPECTIVE\n\nDiscussion\nCHRIS MCKAY: Okay, what I'd like to do now is to go to open discussion. Keep in mind\nwhat you heard, and keep in mind the questions that would be relevant to NASA, in terms\nof sending humans to explore. Points that David made--is it pointless to send humans,\nespecially now with technology advancing and, people argue, we could send machines.\nAnd it ties to these questions that David raised. And what I would like to do is have some\naudience participation and discussion. You can ask questions of anyone you want, or you\ncan make a short statement.\nQUESTION: Darlene Lim, NASA Ames Research Center, and my question is for Bill Stone.\nI wanted to find out what some of the advantages were that you presented, to say it would\nbe more advantageous to send humans into the aquifer and do the mapping that you outline\nversus sending in submersibles?\nBILL STONE: That's a fantastic setup. There might be one or two others in this audience\nwith similar background, but I think I've found myself in a unique position in having spent\nabout a decade of my life designing spacecraft and another decade designing robots, and\nnow robotic spacecraft. During \"CFT,\"or \"copious free time,\" we do some work underground.\nThe answer to your question goes like this, and I'll try to put it to you as succinctly as I can.\nThere are places where robots are entirely logical to be used first, and I classify those in two\nsituations. First, places that are lethal to humans, and second, places which are currently\ntoo remote to get to send people to with our primitive propulsion technology systems. So\nyou send robots in those situations.\nEverything else, in my opinion, is best done with people. Now, at some point, you\ndo have to draw the line in the sand to say this is too risky. As I said when I was looking\nover that list of departed friends--no different from Jim Lovell citing off a list of test\npilots he has known--these are dangerous environments. The reason we are still here\nis because we knew where to draw the line in the sand. Even if we do that, there is still\nunquantifiable risk, so the game is to say, all right, you want to be out there in person.\nProbably everybody in this room wants to be out there in person. Do I want to be here today?\nTo be honest, I'd rather be at Shackleton Crater on the Moon right now, for a couple of\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nEd\nj\n\"\nexamines the unmanned Surveyor III space-\nIntrepid\n(NASA Image # AS12-48-7136)\nyears with a dozen good, qualified people. I'd be happier there than I am here\nor at work. Being on the frontier is what I live for. That's where people like\nViesturs live. If you don't understand that, you need to go on an expedition\nsomewhere remote. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't, but among the people I\nwork with, you can tell right off the ones that are concerned about where they are\n. . . you see it in their eyes when they get to someplace like Camp 3 or Camp 4.\nIn fact, people that I've worked with for years on expeditions have a name\nfor it. They stole it from Jacques Cousteau: it's called \"rapture of the deep.\" You\ncan tell because their eyes are getting wider, and they're sitting there at those\ncamps going, \"I need to be concerned about getting out of here,\" rather than\nfocusing on the ob at hand, which is pushing the exploration frontier. The people\nyou find that have a bigger smile on their face the deeper you go, those are the\npeople you want, those are the ones you want out there with you at the frontier.\nNow, to go back to your question directly, why do this in person? Because it is the\nmost stimulating thing that you will ever experience in your life. I have had the\nprivilege of being where no one has been before many times. It is difficult to put\ninto words to those who have not experienced it just how moving that feeling is.\nIf I had to capture a 20-second image on film that depicted that event and\nwhat its importance is personally to anybody who does it, it would be [from]\nthe film Apollo 13 that Jim Lovell made with Ron Howard, where they show the\nimage of flying by the Moon and the astronauts thinking, \"I could be down there,\nlifting that rock up and looking at it in my hand. That's what drives us on. If you\nlook at what we do in our normal lives, it pales in comparison.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Bill just made a very good case for human exploration. I think\nwe want to hear a countercase, so somebody in the audience think of a good case\nfor why the space program should just be robotic, why we shouldn't risk human\nlife. If there's no one in the audience who can state that case, we don't have a\nwell-selected audience. Somebody come up with the counterpoint, the argument\n(so we can pillory them) why robots are sufficient. With that enticement, we'll\ngo to the question here.\nSTEVE COOK: Steve Cook, NASA Marshall. I won't take that question, but I will\nsay, first off, I think there's a gold mine of analogies here that are applicable to\nexploration that we need to capitalize upon as a country, to sell and sustain a\nvision that I don't think we're doing as well as we could today. With all of the\nexperiences you've been having, a lot of these are firsts with me and I've been\nwith NASA for several years. Question now with risk, with respect to Ed Viesturs\nand to Bill Stone. Ed, you talked about making the decision to hold back--you had\nthe camera crew, this would have been a perfect time to go; your friends did not.\nI'd like you to talk a little bit about the criteria you used versus what you think or\nknow that they used. Why did they go forward versus why did you stay?\nED VIESTURS: When we go to Everest, we spend six or eight weeks preparing\nfor that final day. That's carrying loads, building camps, acclimatizing. And then\nthe idea is that sometime in May, historically, we know that there's going to be\nOPENING PHOTO:\nCharles Conrad, Jr., Apollo 12 Commander,\ncraft during Apollo 12's second extrave-\nhicular activity (EVA-2). The Lunar Module\nis at right in the background.\n\nDISCUSSION\nI\na window of favorable weather that would allow us to do that final 3,000-foot\nclimb. So the whole preparation leads to that. Once you're ready, then you have to\ntake into account everything that you see around you. The weather patterns--now\nwe can get good weather forecasting. In those days, it was just kind of starting to\nwork, but we would have to base our judgment and what we were thinking about\ndoing on what we were seeing, what we were feeling; our gut instinct has a big\nrole in how I make my decision--you know, what am I seeing and how has that\nplayed a role in what I've done in the past. And we made a group decision--David\nBreashears, who'd climbed Everest twice, I'd climbed it four times by then--\nas a group, we all felt that the weather patterns that we were seeing were not\nhistorically what we were waiting to go to the summit with. So we made the\ncall based on that and, also, just the fact that it didn't feel right. And I think Bill\nmentioned that, I think the reason a lot of us are alive today is because we know\nwhen those red flags are popping up, that we have to listen to our instincts. If we\ndiscover later that we made the wrong decision and the weather was good, well,\nbig deal. We erred on the side of safety and being conservative.\nOur friends, they had this date in their mind, and that was May 10th. And,\na lot of times, climbers do that. Come hell or high water, they will just go for\nthe summit on that particular date--because it's auspicious or whatever. And\nI've always said, ultimately, the mountain decides when you can go up, and you\nhave to listen to what the mountain is telling you. There are signals, and you\ncan't blindly, stubbornly go up, because we all know that Mother Nature is much\nstronger than we are. They did start on a good day--it was perfect. And had they\nturned around in enough time, they would have escaped the storm, which came\nlate in the day, which is something that we saw developing every single day the\npast two weeks previously. But, again, they got so close to the top, they pushed\nfurther and further and further away. That umbilical cord of safety got stretched\nand finally broke. And I can't second-guess the decisions that they made.\nwasn't up there. I can evaluate what they did. I can say that I wouldn't have\nmade decisions the way they made them, but, again, as Bill said, there wasn't one\ndecision that was wrong, it was a multitude of little problems, and then the straw\nthat broke the camel's back was the storm, and then people died.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Ed, I'd like to ask you a question. Do you have a personal short\nanswer to the question of why you climb mountains?\nED VIESTURS: I'm a stubborn person, I like challenging projects and, for me,\nclimbing is the most difficult physical and mental thing I can think of doing--\nespecially without oxygen. And I know I have to train, prepare, think about what\nI'm doing, to be successful at it. And there's a huge struggle to get to those\naltitudes without oxygen. And so many things can go wrong, and when you\nsucceed, and when you finally are standing on the summit of Everest, it's an\namazing feeling. And it's something I can't find anywhere else, and, so, I've\nbecome addicted to it.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Would you classify what you do as exploration?\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION:\nBILL STONE:\nED VIESTURS: I explore myself. And I think that's the interesting part. I think,\nalso, you can be in the middle of the desert, you can be down in the ocean, if you\nget in trouble, somebody can come and get you. Up there, you're on your own. If\nyou make a mistake, you have to get yourself out of it. And it's a very rare feeling.\nAs normal, sea-level, landlubbing people, we don't get that feeling of isolation\nwhere we think about every single step and every single move that we make,\n[that] there can be consequences because of those. And that's an interesting\nthing that I feel up there.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Thanks. We have a question here.\nDennis Wingo, Skycorp, Incorporated. And this is for Neil, Ed, and\nyou, Chris. I see a commonality between what you do on the mountain, what\nyou do underground, and what you do in the Arctic. And the commonality is a\nstaged approach, abort modes--you don't do everything in one big, fell swoop.\nAnd it seems that in the space arena that we try to do that, whether it's a manned\nsystem or whether it's un-manned. But especially in the manned, because there's\na religious argument (I call it) going on now at NASA: Do we build a heavy lift\nlaunch vehicle, or do we use the assets that we have to go back to the Moon and\non to Mars? It seems that with the assets that we have now, and that we [will]\nhave in the near term, we could use your staged approach to go to the Moon and\ngo to Mars.\nED VIESTURS: Yeah, for us staging is critical, because we have to not only\nput supplies at various camps, but it's also the process of acclimatization. So,\nyou need to take the time to go at various altitudes, and then come down to\nrecuperate, and then, slowly, work to a higher altitude. It's kind of a necessity\nin both aspects, acclimatizing and, also, then, getting your gear in place. Once\nacclimatized, though, I've developed a system now where we'll go very quickly\nand--like you said, in that big launch vehicle we'll carry everything that we\nneed, and, in three days we'll do what normally takes two months. We'll climb,\nmoving everything with us, and then go to the summit. That's riskier, but it's\nalso faster, because you're spending less time in a dangerous environment. So,\nI think the trade-off is worth it. I'd rather climb faster, without the series of\ncamps behind me, but I need to do that initially to acclimatize.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Bill, you want to give us the downward view of the same thing?\nIt's no more risky than being a test pilot, in my opinion.\nCHRIS MCKAY: And your point?\nBILL STONE: No, I mean, you can control the risks. There's one thing that you\ncan't control, but you can prepare for, and that's the weather. And we're going to\nhave that kind of phenomenology wherever we go, whether it's a big storm that\ncomes in on Everest or whether it's a hurricane that dumps ten inches of rain\nover the plateau and you get a 10-meter-high rise in the water wherever you're\n\nDISCUSSION\n\"\nQUESTIONER\nBILL STONE:\nat. I have friends who have bolted their way 30 meters up a canyon wall in New\nGuinea as the water rose behind them. They hung from rock bolts for 32 hours\nwaiting for it to go down. They were prepared, you know. Yes, they were in a\ndangerous place, but they had their act together.\nLet me extend this to space, because I have actually put a lot of thought\ninto this. I've designed space systems. I've designed reaction control thrusters.\nThings like that. One of the things that apparently has been misunderstood here\nis that we did have complete control over the situations where we were--even\nthe weather. All of our camps were selected to be above the water. The way\nthe ropes were rigged--all of that stuff was of very high reliability. Further, we\ntrained everyone on the team to know when to replace things, if they discovered\nthat a line was fraying, for example. And there were depots of spare rigging tackle\nsituated at various locations along the way for just such emergencies. We even\nhad ways to get out if a rope broke--equipment for scaling overhung domes. We\nhad all these things covered.\nNow, if you switch to trying to think about what are you going to do if\nyou're trying to get to the Moon--which is the next logical target for us to get\nback to here, and prove that we can live off this planet--the first thing you've got\nto say is, all right, how are you going to get to low earth orbit (LEO)? And there\nare only so many ways that we can do that right now.\nYou've now seen what I do. If you were to say to me, \"Would you fly the\nShuttle?\" or something like that, then I'd have to say,\"I have to think very carefully\nabout that,\" because it does not meet my criteria for having an abort mode at any\npoint in the trajectory. You didn't pay me to come out here to give you sweet talk,\nso I'm going to talk to you straight. The last time we had a launch vehicle that met\nthose criteria is when these [Apollo] gentlemen were flying. Why on Earth have\nwe not done that now? That's just my personal impression. If I was going to try to\nput something up there, we'd probably be using ELVs with abort modes to get us\nout to LEO. Beyond that, you're into the issue of how survivable are your vehicles?\nYou need to be thinking in terms of propulsion, life support, and everything else.\nYou guys are great at this. NASA is a technological gem on this planet. But,\nunfortunately, you don't have any true \"expedicionarios\" here, as we say down\nin Mexico--true expeditionary people who think, \"Two years from now we're\ngoing to run an expedition to the Moon.\" And then go do it. The way NASA\nthinks these days is, \"We can develop these technologies and, maybe, 15 to 20\nyears from now we'll be back on the Moon. That's too late. That's too late. You've\ngot to get there now and learn from the frontier, just the way we've been doing\nunderground here on Earth. Those places you've seen today were unexplored 12\nyears ago--completely unknown. We built the technology to go there. Given the\nenormous resources at NASA, there is no reason that we can't be back on the\nMoon within five to seven years, max.\n: If the Moon is where you want to go.\nThere you go!\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION:\nQUESTION:\nDALE ANDERSEN: I want to go back to your question about staging, which was\ndoing things in steps. I think a lot of the issue there is knowing what the stages\nought to be. I remember once getting a lot of flack--we were going to the Antarctic\nto do diving under the ice. I put in travel orders to go to Key West--that was our\nstaging spot. We were going to do training for ice diving in Key West.\nNow, maybe you could argue that was a good place to go to stage the\nAntarctic, or maybe you could argue that it wasn't necessary. So, when we plan\nanything, any expedition, I like to think: What is our goal? What are we really\ntrying to do? What's the driver at the long end? And, then, what do we have to\ndo to get there? If you look at the way Apollo worked, as I understand it, it was\nvery much that way--as we heard this morning. You want to go to the Moon,\nso you need to develop docking, you need to demonstrate that you can stay in\na spacecraft, and so on. Take something like Gemini--it was a requirements-\ndriven program: If you want to go to the Moon, you're going to have to do\nthis first. It wasn't: Let's do Gemini and see where it leads, or some nebulous\nconcept that, somehow, if we develop these things, a mission to the Moon will\nmiraculously appear from the pieces.\nAnd, I think, as we think ahead to an exploration program, we have to do\nthe same thing: Where do we really want to go, and, then, what are the pieces that\nlead us there? And I think that's also what Bill was saying. So your question is a\nvery good one, and I think exploration on Earth, and people that plan expeditions\non Earth--the logic that they approach can be applied, but the answer is not so\neasy to come by.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Okay. Maybe someone can address my challenge to pick up the\ncase for robots, but probably not you!\nWell, maybe I will! I'm from Goddard Space Flight Center, a scientist-\ntype as opposed to a program manager, which seems to have been commented\nupon today.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Derisively, I might add!\nIt seems to me that over the years NASA has been very ambivalent\nabout people in space and science. Back in the '60s, getting people up there seemed\nto be something done for its own sake. Putting somebody on the Moon was done\nfor its own sake. Then, in the '70s and up to maybe the '90s, we started getting\ninto a mode where we were trying to be sold on the fact that people had to be there\nto do the science better. And it never appeared to me that that was the case--that\nit was a selling job to justify getting people in space, for the most part.\nAnd I guess my question now is: do you think that the public, Congress,\nand the media are ready to do real people in space as opposed to trying to do the\nscience with robotics? My personal feeling is much of the science could be done\nbetter with robotics, but we're not going in that direction right now.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Okay. That's a good start to the case for robots. And I think we\nneed to put that case out there as part of the complete discussion, because one\n\nDISCUSSION\nPENNY BOSTON:\nPENNY BOSTON: I think\nis no\nand\nanswer to the risks is, don't send people. You avoid the risks. If we go back to\nDale's categorization of risks--mission risk, personal risk, and team risk--what\nyou eliminate is the personal risk and team risk by not sending people. Certainly,\nwhen Steve Squyres did the MER mission, there was risk. But no one's life was\nat stake on Mars--it was just a programmatic risk, a science risk. The worst case\nthat could happen was that Steve would have wasted seven years of his life and\nno publications would have come out of it. Steve might have felt that that was a\ndisaster, but no one would have gotten killed over it.\nSo, I think the case where we think about risk--we can't just assume that\nmeans that humans are in the loop by definition and, therefore, we figure out\nhow to deal with the risk with humans. We have to step back once and say: are\nhumans even an essential part of the program, of the loop, or do we try to do\nscience by robotics?\nSo, now we've made the case for robots. Let's let the panel and the audience\nreact to that case. David is going to add to that. We've got a momentum going here!\nDAVID ROBERTS: No, I actually would strongly believe that robots are the answer.\nAnd I think it's probably my father's influence, because he told me years ago, as an\nastronomer, that there's no way we're ever going to get very far in human terms\nin space, so the future is going to be robotic. And I found the Mars rover landings\nmore gripping than the original Moon landings, human-equipped Moon landings.\nAnd I would say that the Hubble Telescope was far more important and exciting\nto me than any manned travel in space.\nAnd I think that, for the first time in history, maybe we can actually make the\nemotional and psychological investment in machine discovery--as we're also doing\nin the deep sea--in lieu of the conquistador going out there and doing it himself.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Okay. Penny, I'm hoping you'll take the contrary view!\nYou know I am!\nCHRIS MCKAY: What a surprise!\nthat there\ndichotomy between robotic\nhuman exploration. I think much ado is made out of that. They're obviously context-\ndependent. There are strong reasons why we're interested in human exploration\nbeyond simply the scientific function. And I disagree that now, or any time in the\nnear future, or even the mid-term future, we can design a robotic instrument that can\nhave the capabilities of the tremendous flexibility that a field scientist can have.\nHowever, that being said, I am a great fan of robotics missions. I love robots--\nI wish I had whole fleets of them myself. I'm trying to get MIT [Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology] and JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] to build whole fleets\nof them--because they're a tool. They're not a viable life form at this point. At\nthis point, it's not as if we're going to send robots or people. They are obviously\ncomplementary to the whole scientific process. But science is, fundamentally, a\nhuman enterprise, and the value of science is, fundamentally, to us as humans.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nthe j\nQUESTION:\nAnd, so, therefore, cutting us entirely out of the loop, I think, is inexcusable.\nAnd, so, wherever in the solar system we can send people, where it makes\nsense and where people can significantly contribute--and one of the things\nthat they have to contribute is that perception of the human experience of\nexploration--then I think that we should endeavor to do that, and save the\nrobots to be our helpers and to go places where we can't go, to go first. And\neven on Earth, where we're exploring certain caves where we have tiny channels\nthat we can't get into, even microrobotic devices there would greatly enrich our\nscientific exploration.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Well said. Dale, and then Nathalie, can respond to the same\nquestion, and then we'll take a question here from the woman in black, and then\nJim Garvin. Dale?\nDALE ANDERSEN: Briefly, I was just going to actually completely agree. I think\nit's a mix; it's not an either/or case. When robotics are required they should do\nob, and when people have the capability to go to those places, people should\nbe in the loop.\nI've used both robotics and going there myself, and I have to admit, I've\nbeen underwater with robotics, for example, while people at Ames have been\ndiving with me virtually via that robotic device. That's a great way to share your\nexperience in a remote location with a greater population. But it's not an either/\nor thing; it's just the right tool for the right place at the right time.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Nathalie, could you add a little to that? And then we'll go back\nto general questions.\nNATHALIE CABROL: I'm supporting both Dale's and Penny's views, because I've\nbeen putting together in the field an astronaut and a robot. And neither are always\nbest, but they complement each other. And for exploring a planet, the human\nbeing will bring in his immediate background and an understanding of what's\naround him, which a robot cannot do now and will not be able to do in a long time.\nBut, by the same token, the robot does not care too much about the environment.\nIs it cold, is it hot, is there lots of UV radiation? If there is an opportunity, they\njust don't care, they can last a long time at the surface. Together, they are almost\nan invincible team, but I would go a little step farther than that. I would say\nthat, no matter what we think about it, exploration is within our genes. This is\nwhere part of evolution is right there in us. We wouldn't be here if we wouldn't\nhave been taking risks and going from one place to another and exploring diverse\nhabitats. And another planet is just the next frontier for us; there will be farther\nfrontiers than that.\nI'm Becky Ramsey, I'm from NASA Headquarters, and I have to say\nthat regarding human versus robot, I have to come down on the human side,\nbecause I want to go. Yeah, and that actually leads into an issue I want to raise. I\nwant to touch on something that we talked about earlier this morning, and that's\nindividual versus government exploration. To bring up the example from this\n\nDISCUSSION\nQUESTION:\nmorning, Burt Rutan is ready to launch in just a couple of days here. What he's\ndone is private financing, small group, hand-picked people. And that seems to be\nvery similar to what you all do, whether it's individual or privately financed or\ngovernment financed, even if it's a direct NASA project. What you do seems to\nbe very small--one person, five people, even a hundred and fifty people--when\nyou compare that to my colleague and I who work in the same building and have\nnot met before today. That's very different. You know everybody on your team,\nand you're getting a lot further out there than we are. Is there something to be\nsaid for that--can we do this? Can government do this, can an agency like NASA\ndo, in space, what you have managed to do here on Earth? Or do we need to find a\ndifferent way and look at smaller, more team-focused models to do this?\nCHRIS MCKAY: That's a really good question, and when we look beyond Earth\norbit to distant destinations like Mars, the question becomes more pressing,\nbecause those teams have to be, by light-travel time requirements, more and\nmore autonomous, and less dependent on remote control from Mission Control.\nAnybody want to address that, comment on that? Penny and Bill, think of an\nanswer, too.\nPENNY BOSTON: Okay, I'm thinking real hard, that's a really serious question\npeople are wrestling with. The kinds of expeditionary things that we do are very\nsmall compared to a full-on mission to another planet. Therefore, the sheer\nnumber of people involved is so large in order to pull off a mission like that. In\nsome ways, I'm not entirely sure that a lot of our experience in these smaller units\nis directly applicable. Because, by force, you have to involve so many more people,\nand the level of planning complexity far exceeds anything that any of us do.\nSo, the question is, can you do that in a governmental environment? Well,\nI think NASA is doing it in a governmental environment. And I don't see why,\nfundamentally, that transition from the kinds of missions that we're doing now\ncan't be applied to also incorporate serious, meaningful, human exploration, plus\nan ongoing program. I don't see that it's not possible, with the caveat that, for\ncertain applications, perhaps small companies are better, for certain limited things.\nBurt Rutan is also not doing NASA. He is not doing NASA in a can, basically. He\nis doing a very different scale of things than NASA has to worry about.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Okay, I'm going to skip Bill's answer, because I think Penny hit the\nnail on the head, so we're going on to the next question, which is Jim Garvin.\nWell, thanks Chris. I'm Jim Garvin, NASA Headquarters, Moon-\nMars. I wanted to comment, and then address, an issue to the panel and everyone\nabout the robot/human dichotomy, because I don't think it is one, and I think\nwe have to pay attention to the great observations you all made. Because, in our\nhistory of space exploration, it was the robots that did the reconnaissance, the\nadvance planning, and let the humans, like the great courageous heroes today,\ndo the work. And I would submit to you that it was the humans back on Earth,\nand Apollo 17 and the others, continuing the work of the robotic spacecraft. So\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION:\n(NASA Image # JSC-2004-E-18861)\nit's that partnership that's important. And in many of the cases you've talked\nabout, robotic reconnaissance wasn't needed to open the frontier. The humans\ncould do that on the fly.\nI would dare say I wouldn't want any of you brave people to go to the\nsurface of Venus for the first time. It's probably better for our robot friends to\ndo that. And today, as we think about Mars, I would submit that we're learning\nthrough the rovers that Steve [Squyres] will talk about. And what we're planning\nin the future is the reconnaissance necessary to go to those sweet spots on\nMars. So then the humans become important onsite to do that kind of work.\nAnd I always marvel, if we think about this dichotomy, humans and robotics\nwork together when we look at the samples brought back from the Moon from\nthe Apollo mission. These multikilograms, each one itself a mini-universe for\nrobotics and people to work together with here, to understand that world on the\nMoon. Imagine that anywhere we go, whether it be on Earth or beyond.\nSo, I look at it as the reconnaissance that's important, and today, a lot of\nthat reconnaissance is better done on Mars, on the Moon, on Venus, way out\nwhere the origins of the universe are, by the machine. The question is, here\non Earth, how can we amplify your experiences in these unique environments\nto better train us to use that reconnaissance to make the tactical decision to\nput humans on site, because we need to because it's in our gene pool, or it's\nnecessary; it makes us better samplers. That's the question that I think this risk\nconference is treating, and I think, at times, that unfortunately comes down to\nthe ugly words \"programmatic cost.\" Where is the timing of that benefit?\nCHRIS MCKAY: Okay, good comment. Let's go to Keith for another comment or\na question.\nKeith Cowing, NASA Watch.com: Okay, you were trying to pick a\nfood fight a few minutes ago, and I love a food fight.\nAn artist's rendering of crewmembers setting up equipment during a Mars polar exploration.\n\nDISCUSSION\nKEITH COWING:\nQUESTION:\nCHRIS MCKAY: I'm trying to claim my role as moderator to stir the conversation.\nWell, in that case, I'll take that on.\nCHRIS MCKAY: You can always fire the moderator, you know.\nKEITH COWING: Whether it's robots or humans, in essence, it comes down to us\ngoing out there, whether we do it first or second or in tandem, and I guess one\nobservation to make, to throw a little raw meat into this argument, is it's all about\nwhat we as a culture are looking to do. When is the last time somebody threw a\nticker tape parade for a robot for doing something in space? When's the last time\nwe all cried at a national funeral when a robot didn't work? Just an observation.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Let's go to Donna Roberts, since I skipped her in the sequence.\nSorry, Donna, you had your hand up a while ago, and then we'll come back to\nyou, Steve.\nI'm Donna Roberts, of the University of California San Francisco\nMedical Center, and my question is, with humans and extreme environments,\nwhere safety is utmost, and pushing physical capabilities, what is necessary for\nmedicine? Should it be a first aid kit, should it be medicine, should doctors be\nthere, what kind of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities should we have?\nCHRIS MCKAY: Can we get some quick answer? Penny, Bill, we'll let you answer\nthis one.\nBILL STONE: You just got me fired up. If you asked me to go plan an expedition\nto Shackleton Crater or something, who would you take? And I've thought about\nthis, the answer is, number one, you bet, you're going to have a physician. He/she\nalso would probably be cotrained in dentistry. You may have to have a back-up to\nthat person, as well, who is perhaps cotrained in something else. We try to have a\nphysician on every project that I have ever run. It's just too good a capability to have\nat base camp, whether they're out in front or not. It's one of those contingency\nthings you have to think about when you're talking about long-duration projects.\nOK, if you're at a place where you're only an hour and a half away in orbit before\nyou can drop back in--like you are right now at the space station--it's not such a\ncritical thing, provided you have on-demand reentry. You're not going to have that\non the Moon. So, yeah, you will have to have physicians out there, no question\nabout it. The question is, what other skills should they have? And if I had to pick\ntwo, I would say emergency room experience and dentistry. The other surgical\ndisciplines can be actually done through telesupport from the ground, as long\nas the individual on the expedition has basic surgery skills, as most ER types\nhave. You can go on from there with all the other skills as well. My estimates for\na sustainable lunar base exploratory mission run from 12 to 18 individuals, not\nunlike the minimum critical mass we currently use on deep caving expeditions.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Isn't that something--you go to Mars so you can visit the\ndentist. That's why we need to send humans. Robots don't need dentists. We\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION\nhave a question here, and then we'll get to Steve. If you can pass the mike to Steve\nSquyres. A question here?\n: This is for Doctor Stone. Scott McGuinness, submariner, a student\nhere [at the Naval Postgraduate School]. Doctor Stone, as a diver, I was looking\nat your videos, and you go deep into these caves, and you dive. U.S. Navy tables\nand the Haldanean model don't take that into consideration. So, my question\nis, how did you mitigate the risk of decompression illness (DCI), and how can\nthat compare to the risk of radiation and all that for astronauts going to Mars?\nIt seems like one of NASA's larger problems is how do we mitigate the radiation\nhazards of deep space.\nBILL STONE: Decompression is not a big issue for lunar and Mars missions, at\nleast from my standpoint. Mike Gernhardt and I could probably debate this for\nanother 8 to 10 hours. The answer to your question is, those life support devices\nthat you saw there had triple parallel redundant decompression engines running\nin real time--that is, the algorithms were running in parallel on three separate\nprocessors at the same time, such that you were guaranteed a valid tissue tension\neven if two of the three processors shut down during a mission. The algorithms\nwere written in accordance with what we had known to be conservative, and we\ndrew a line that was about 15 percent more conservative above that. It took into\naccount real-time oxygen concentration and then fed that through a head-up\ndisplay. What that meant in terms of an operational situation is that when a\nyellow light would come on while you were in the middle of a dive, it would mean\nthat you had to be considering what your decompression scenario was going to\nbe like when you started to come back up. When we got to those stages, we would\nautomatically boost the oxygen concentration, such that we were far in excess\nof what would be required for a conservative decompression, yet below central\nnervous system (CNS) toxicity limits. We have never had a bends hit on any of\nthose deep caving projects, even though we're diving at altitude. All of those\nPLSS units have triplex digital depth sensors that are also sensing atmospheric\npressure at the altitude at which we were diving. That was all really taken care of\npretty conservatively.\nAs far as I understand it, and I don't profess to be an expert at this, the\nissue of space radiation is really one of shielding and stochastic analysis of what\nthe radiation environments are. You don't want to be out there on the 11-year\ncycle at solar max. If I remember correctly, there were some analyses of deep space\nradiation loading that were done in the '70s that indicate--and I can't remember a\nspecific citation, maybe Jim knows--that between two of the Apollo flights there\nwas a solar anomaly of sufficient magnitude that if you had been flying to the\nMoon during that time, there may have been some serious exposure issues. To\nme, dealing with deep space radiation exposure is actually something you can\nmitigate through a series of water barriers and things like that. I believe it's 10\ncentimeters of water that is sufficient to stop most of that. If you check through\nthe right areas and within NASA, and probably JSC [Johnson Space Center] has\n\nDISCUSSION\nQUESTION:\nI\nan\nj\n.\npeople in this, you'll find the answers to those questions. They've been looked at\nthoroughly. I don't consider that anything more than an engineering problem.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Steve Squyres. Introduce yourself.\nSteve Squyres, Cornell University.\nwant to return briefly to\nissue that was raised earlier about how small organizations seem to be able to\nsometimes accomplish more. If you look at what somebody like Ed Viesturs does\nor what Bill Stone does, or if you look at a group like Burt Rutan and what they\nare accomplishing there, it's easy to look at an organization like that and say, \"Boy,\nthey're lean, they're compact, they're able to get the ob done.\" You then look at\nlarger government agencies and you sense a difficulty there. But I think there is\na wonderful counterexample. The wonderful counterexample was what Jim Lovell\ntalked about this morning. It was Apollo.\nYou look at Apollo, and you look at Gemini, and you look at Mercury,\nyou look at what was accomplished in those days, and it [NASA] was a huge\norganization. It was in some ways bigger than the NASA of today. Yet, they got\nthings done.\nWhen I look at that, what strikes me is that there was a common thread\nthrough those organizations, and that is that they knew exactly what it was\nthey were trying to do. The level-one requirement for Apollo was stated in one\nsentence by the President. When Ed goes up a mountain, he knows what his\nlevel-one requirements are. It is very, very clearly stated. If you have a common\ngoal that is clearly understood by everybody in your organization, I don't think it\nmatters how big the organization is.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Good point, Steve. We have five minutes left. We have time for\ntwo questions.\nEUGENE RODDENBERRY: Hi. My name is Eugene Roddenberry. My father\nactually created Star Trek and, working in the industry, I have met a lot of\npeople who have been inspired by the show. It's completely different to work\nin entertainment, but the people who have been inspired have inspired me to\nlook around the world and meet individuals like yourselves. I think you guys\nhave shown that humanity is able to overcome adversities. And the fact that that\ninspires other scientists and other people in the field to reach for the stars or\ndown to the depths of the ocean--I think it goes beyond that. You guys inspire\nfans who have disabilities to overcome those disabilities, people who are in\nrelationships, people who have everyday risks that they need to take. I think\nthe fact that they see that humanity can take these huge leaps--these steps\nbeyond--is important It is very impressive. I just wanted to say thank you to\neveryone. It's very exciting.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Thanks for your comments. The next time you send a message\nto your Dad, thank him for me. I was one of those Trekkies that got inspired\nto seek out new worlds and all that stuff from watching the show. It's the only\ntelevision I watched. Larry?\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nLARRY LEMKE: Larry Lemke, NASA Ames. I would like to actually follow up\non Steve's comment, and some others on this whole question of how do you\ntake the lesson from small-scale exploration and put it into a bigger context.\nI agree with Steve. I actually don't think that size of the organization per se is\nthe issue. If you look at the participants on the panel, one of the sort of obvious\ncharacteristics that they share is that, not only do they plan the expeditions,\nthey do the expeditions. I am reminded of that comment that there's nothing\nlike the prospect of being hanged in the morning to concentrate your efforts. If\nyou look at the way NASA typically plans a large human exploration project, it is\nsort of notable that the people who are making the decisions very often do not\nreally have to experience the personal consequences of those decisions. I think if\nthat were to change, then the results might change as well.\nCHRIS MCKAY: So, you're saying we should send a NASA administrator to Mars?\nIs that a way of interpreting what you said?\nLARRY LEMKE: Or have the NASA administrator to actually design the vehicle.\nGet the opportunity to fly in what you design.\nCHRIS MCKAY: We actually have a few more minutes.\nQUESTION: Bruce McCandless, two Shuttle flights [astronaut]. We get back to\nthe human versus robot trade-off. Currently, when you are looking at a Mars\nmission, you're looking at speed of light transit times, round trip up to 40 minutes.\nSo, obviously, it's gonna be hours when you get out to the vicinity of Jupiter\nand Saturn. The thing that seems to be missing is the refined decision-making\nability, the ability to adapt to unforeseen situations, to recognize something that\nyou haven't been programmed to recognize. I assume that, eventually, computer\nscience will advance to the point where we can send androids. I wonder if anyone\nwould like to comment on the speed of light transit time as a factor in trading\noff between humans and robots.\nCHRIS MCKAY: That's a good point. Maybe I ought to add to that question, how\nwill that influence the autonomy of an expedition on Mars versus the autonomy\nof, say, a Shuttle or a station where there is virtually no delay--see them as being\nmore autonomous or not. Does anybody want to approach that? Penny? Dale?\nPENNY BOSTON: Yes. I think that it's a return to some of this historical\nstuff that Jack Stuster was talking about this morning: the fact that those\nexpeditions, before there was the kind of instantaneous communication that\nwe all have, were able to operate and do what they needed to do. We seem to\nsomehow believe now that we cannot do that any more. I think that a different\nkind of planning within NASA perhaps will be necessary to take us back to\nsome elements of that kind of self-contained expedition.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nOpen next section\n\nS E S S I O N T W O\nsea\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nDiving Shipwrecks\nI have a fantastic job working for the History Channel. I travel around\nthe world, I get to talk to some very interesting people, I get to talk about history, and I get\nto dive shipwrecks. This winter, I think I am going to be in France, Scotland, Croatia, the\nDominican Republic, and the South Pacific. And when I'm not addressing an audience full\nof astronauts, I say I have the best job in the world.\nPrior to my working for television, I spent more than 20 years working as a commercial\ndiver, largely in and around New York City, where I worked on everything from nuclear\nreactors to bridges to pipelines--wherever the work was. That was my day job. Before I even\ngot involved in commercial diving, I was diving shipwrecks for recreation. I was attracted by\nthe history, and I was attracted by the challenge that wreck diving afforded me.\nThere is a big difference between commercial diving and scuba diving. In commercial\ndiving, the diver is a cog in the machine. He is part of a bigger team. When it comes to\nscuba diving, you are everything. You are your own dive planner and your own dive support.\nYou are your own dive rescue. There is a certain freedom, and, of course, that's linked with\nresponsibility. Eventually, as I acquired more and more experience, I started diving deeper and\nU-869\nKurson, Shadow Divers\nDoria\nRMS Lusitania\nHMHS Britannic\nDeep Sea Detectives, on the History Channel.\ni\nl Di\nJohn Chatterton spent more than twenty years working as a commercial diver and as a boat captain.\nHis passion, however, has been researching and diving shipwrecks. In 1991, his discovery, and then\nsubsequent identification of the German submarine\n, in 230 feet of salt water (fsw) off the coast of\nNew Jersey has been the subject of several television documentaries and now a bestselling book by Robert\n. His diving credits include more than 150 dives to the passenger liner Andrea\n(250 fsw), the first trimix-breathing expedition to the\nin Ireland (300 fsw), and the first\nrebreather dive to the\nin Greece (400 fsw). John has worked on numerous projects for\ntelevision and is currently hosting the television series,\nJohn Chatterton\nProfess ona\nver\n\nDoria\nhad no\n(NASA Image # JSC-2003-E-45587)\nmore challenging wrecks. I found myself going deep inside wrecks like the Andrea\n. The goal of these dives was just to go where other men had not yet been.\nIn 1991, Captain Bill Nagle got a set of coordinates from a fisherman 60\nmiles off the New Jersey coast in what we were told was about 200 feet of water.\nWe put together a trip to the site, we went out there, and what we found was a\nwreck in 230 feet of water. It was a submarine, later identified as the German\nU-boat U-869. It was a submarine that no one was aware of, where it was, or\nthat it existed. No government, no navy, no historian, no expert could tell us\nwhich submarine this was. What an irresistible mystery. It afforded the divers\nwho discovered it the opportunity to rewrite a page of history. We thought at the\ntime that it was going to be a matter of a day or two--on the next dive we would\nbe identifying this submarine. Of course, that didn't happen. It took six years to\npositively identify it.\nIn retrospect, looking at our plan, we broke it down into three divisions:\neconomics, operations, and psychology. Economically, we\nfinancial\nassistance. We had no support. We had no budget. Essentially, I was going to\nhave to do it on my lunch money. That meant that we were going to dive the\nwreck to try and identify it the way we had been diving it--as scuba divers. It's a\nminimalist approach, and it is extremely risky. It's dangerous. Operationally, what\nwas our plan? Well, there were certain legalities that needed to be addressed,\ndealing with the German government. We then had to do research. Of course,\nresearch is what fueled our dive plan. What was there on the wreck site that we\ncould recover that would positively identify the wreck?\nThe teamwork that we used was indirect. In other words, we would work\nwith one another on research, we would work with one another on planning and\ncoordinating, and that kind of thing. However, you can see that in an environment\nlike this one, to put two or three divers in there is counterproductive to making\nthe dive safer. Because of the silt, because of the very tight spaces in there, and\nbecause of the entanglements, you couldn't get in there with more than one\nperson at a time. Specifically, the risks that we were facing relative to the diving\nwere decompression sickness, the possibility of oxygen toxicity, and equipment\nmalfunctions or failures. When we started diving the wreck, we were diving it on\nair, and we quickly converted to tri-mix with nitrox and oxygen decompression.\nWe had to use redundant systems for primary systems. We also had to be very\nconscious of health problems. If you faint out in front of this building, they are\ngoing to call an ambulance, and they are going to come and get you and take you\nover to the hospital. If you have a medical problem deep on a wreck, you're going\nto have a difficult time surviving.\nOn the wreck itself, it's dark. There are entanglements everywhere. You can\nsee there are hanging wires and that sort of thing. There are fishing nets. There\nis also the possibility of entrapment, of a loose piece of wreckage collapsing onto\nthe diver. That happened to at least two divers, me being one of them. I'm the only\none that survived. You can get lost, either inside the wreck or outside the wreck.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nInside the Aquarius research habitat,\na curious astronaut, Clayton C. Anderson,\nsmiles as he is greeted by an equally\ncurious school of marine fish peering\nthrough the habitat viewing port in waters\noff the Florida Keys.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nAnd, then, there's the possibility of panic. The thing that panic does in a\nvery stressful situation is, all of a sudden, your decisions and your actions are not\nlogical. They are not in your own best interest. My goal in this dive was to find\na small pad on those hatches at 12 o'clock, which we knew existed. The problem\nwas [that] it was made from white metal that completely [had] corroded away.\nPsychologically, this is an extremely intimidating environment. Aside from\nthe fact that 58 German sailors lost their lives inside this submarine, a total of\nthree divers lost their lives diving the wreck while I was working there.\nSo, you have changing conditions. You are diving by yourself. You also have\nto consider how obsessed you are, how driven you are. Is this affecting your good\njudgment? We talked about this yesterday on the panel: when do you abort the\nmission? You have to be able to do that while you still can.\nSix years later, I brought out a tag that positively identified the wreck as U-\n869. The CBS program NOVA did a two-hour documentary on it. The people that\nI worked with on that documentary later introduced me to the History Channel\nwhere I now work. Robert Kurson saw the documentary and wrote the book\nShadow Divers: The True Adventure of Two Americans Who Risked Everything to\nSolve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II. Now Twentieth Century Fox has\nbought the rights to the book, and Bill Boyles, the man who wrote the screenplay\nfor Apollo 13, is working on the screenplay as we speak.\nWhy go through all this? My ex-wife used to ask me that all the time. And\nI didn't have a snappy answer like George Mallory. It has to do with challenge. It\nhas to do with perseverance. It has to do with who we are, not just as individuals,\nbut, really, as a culture. Exploration is very much who we are, and we really have\ntwo choices. We either continue on a path of exploration, or we just quit. Not\neverybody is comfortable with quitting. Certainly explorers aren't. As an added\nbenefit, I am going to close with this letter. I get letters like this occasionally. This\none came last Friday.\n\"My name is Anka Hartung. My grandfather was Mr. Eric Poltey. He was\nthe machinist [obergefreiter] on the submarine U-boat 869.

This conference, of course, is dedicated to the concept\nof risk. And maybe there's an underlying message about why expose real live human beings\nto certain obvious dangers when you could--and maybe should--send a machine? Well,\nI love machines. I mean, I have had a hand in building quite a lot of them, developing and\nusing hundreds of variations on the theme of little machines that operate remotely, as well\nas those that take a few real, live people inside. And when a job is right, I do believe that it's\nobvious--you know, pick up a robot, send it, and enjoy it, such as when you're exploring\ndeep under the ice in the Antarctic or in the high Arctic. Send a robot first to check out\nwhat's down there, before you go look for yourself up close and personal. I whole-heartedly\nendorse the concept of using whatever tool does the job, but I think I share with maybe\neverybody in this room the belief that there's nothing like being there, right? If you can\nactually get there, why not?\nBut what about the risk? I'm asked about that quite a lot. You know, why do you do the\nthings that you do? Aren't you scared? Aren't you concerned? I mean, you have a family; don't\nlvi\nle\ni\nl\ni\nSylvia Earle is an oceanographer, marine botanist, ecologist, and writer. A pioneering aquanaut and\nmarine explorer, Earle made her first scuba dive at age 17. She has since set the women's depth record\nfor solo diving (1,000 meters/3,281 feet) and logged more than 6,000 diving hours--feats that garnered\nher the moniker \"Her Deepness.\" The author of five books and numerous scientific and popular articles,\nEarle tirelessly calls for the preservation and exploration of the world's marine ecosystems.\nSy\na Ear\nFounder and Cha r, Deep Ocean Exp orat on and Research, Inc.\n\nthey object to the idea of you going down underwater? It's dangerous! My answer\nis usually the same. The most dangerous thing I do almost every day of my life is to\nget into an automobile, get on the highway, and move along at reasonably moderate\nspeed, and I face traffic coming the other direction, and the only thing that keeps\nme from banging into that traffic is a painted line down the middle of the road and\na mutual desire--I hope it's mutual--to live. That's really dangerous.\nI think about explorers of the past and what they would think of this\nconference. I mean, we are so obsessed with safety these days, so obsessed with\nrisk. Can you imagine what OSHA would say about Christopher Columbus,\nor about the Challenger [oceanographic] expedition in 1872 as they made their\npreparations to go for four years around the world, going places where nobody\nhad been, exploring deep parts of the ocean? Imagine what they would say about\nWilliam Beebe with his little bathysphere and Otis Barton, the engineer [who\ncreated the bathysphere]. And if you've seen any of the films--and I have--of\ntheir operations, anybody associated with OSHA would have heart attacks just\nwatching. No hardhats! No hard shoes, running around barefoot on the deck with\nthis heavy equipment being slung around. Who would have insured Beebe or\nhis machine back in the 1930s? There's something that's happening to us as a\nspecies as we become risk-averse.\nBut I share with Anne Morrow Lindbergh some thoughts about risk. She\nand her husband Charles paved the way for the first flights across the North Pole,\nlooking for ways to establish new commercial air flight routes back in the 1930s.\nAnd when asked by a reporter as they set off for their first flight across the North\nPole--north to the Orient--the reporter asked her, \"Can't you even say that you\nthink it's an especially dangerous trip?\" And she said, \"I'm sorry, I really don't\nhave anything to say. After all, we want to go. What more is there to say?\" And\nthat's it. You know, as explorers, like little kids, we want to know what's around\nthe next corner, what's under the next rock, what's over the next horizon, what's\nin the deep, what's beyond the next star--or starfish.\nDanger is the silent partner of exploration, no doubt about it. But just try\nto avoid risk in everything you do. I have a home in Florida--that's risky! I have a\nhome here in California--think of the earthquakes--that's pretty risky. I live in this\nday and age. I walk in the streets of Washington, DC at night! That's really risky.\nWhen it comes to the ocean, I want to go. I want to have access, not just\nto the highest reaches of this planet. In fact, since the first ascent to the top of\nMount Everest half a century ago, more than 2,000 people have been to the top of\nMount Everest--literally the top of the world. It will soon be half a century since\nthe first successful trip to the deepest part of the ocean. That was the Everest of\nthe ocean, 11 kilometers down--7 miles--the bottom of the Marianas Trench,\nnot too far from the coast of the Philippines. That was nine years before the first\nfootprints were on the Moon--1960 when that took place--13 years after Thor\nHeyerdahl's expedition across the Pacific with a balsa wood raft. Again, OSHA\nwould not have approved. At a depth of seven miles, two men looked out of the\nport of the little machine, the bathyscaphe Trieste, at a depth of seven miles and\nOPENING PHOTO:\nDr. Sylvia Earle prepares to dive in a JIM\nsuit. (Image ID: nur07563, OAR/National\nUndersea Research Program (NURP))\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\na pressure of 16,000 pounds per square inch, in that eternal darkness of the deep\nsea, except for bioluminescent creatures, which are virtually everywhere in the\nocean. They saw eyes looking back. It was a flounder-like fish. And everybody\njoked, of course, it had to be a flounder-like fish, a flat fish, with 16,000 pounds\nof pressure per square inch.\nBut there you are. For about half an hour, almost half a century ago, they\nhad a glimpse of the deepest part of the ocean. Nobody's been back since. How\ncan this be? Presently there are four vehicles that exist that can take people to\njust over half the ocean's depth--the two Russian Mir subs, the French Nautile,\nthe Japanese Shinkai 6500. The Japanese tethered robot Kaiko did get some\nobservations a few times in the deepest part of the sea in the last decade, but it\nwas lost at sea last year. They confirmed, however, the existence of abundant and\ndiverse life at the deepest part of the sea, and soon, Woods Hole Oceanographic\nInstitution will have, with support from our taxpayer funds, a tethered robot that\nwill, again, go to the deepest sea. But it will take a few years. China is building\na 7,000-meter manned sub, and the United States is getting back into the deep\nsub game when that workhorse of all subs, the Alvin, will be replaced in the next\nfew years with a 6,500-meter sub.\nWell, I say, why only 6,500, why 7,000 meters when we're looking at an\nocean that is 11,000 meters deep? I want to go to the deepest part of the ocean. I\nmean, who doesn't? Why wouldn't you want to go? But I'm told, you know, we've\ngot access with a 6,500-meter or even a 7,000-meter sub to about 98 percent of\nthe ocean. So, it's only 2 percent, why worry about that? Well, it's 2 percent--it's\nan area about the size of the United States and an area about the size of Australia\nor China, and we'll just write that off. And it's a unique high-pressure realm.\nRemember, 16,000 pounds per square inch of pressure. Where else on the planet\nare you going to find forms of life that can survive in a realm like that? It's a place\nwhere basic ocean processes are taking place as well, the bottom of the deep\ntrenches where the crust of the ocean is diving under the continental plates.\nWell, I've conveyed my concerns about the powers that be that are stopping\nat 6,500 to 7,000 meters. I say, \"Lewis and Clark didn't stop at the Rockies and\nsay, 'That's good enough. Why bother going all the way to the coast?' Sir Edmund\n\"\n\"\nYOU KNOW, AS EXPLORERS, LIKE LITTLE KIDS, WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S\nAROUND THE NEXT CORNER, WHAT'S UNDER THE NEXT ROCK, WHAT'S OVER\nTHE NEXT HORIZON, WHAT'S IN THE DEEP, WHAT'S BEYOND THE NEXT STAR--OR\nSTARFISH. DANGER IS THE SILENT PARTNER OF EXPLORATION . . .\n\"\n\"\nSYLVIA EARLE\nDEEP OCEAN EXPLORATION\n\nHillary and Norgay Tenzing didn't stop 98 percent of the way up to the top of\nMount Everest, and we didn't travel 98 percent of the way to the Moon and turn\naround and say, \"That's good enough.\" Or to Mars. You know, we actually have\nsent probes and landed on Mars, and someday we will get back to the deepest\npart of the sea. And, frankly, I don't know what's stopping us. Unless there's a\ncertain resistance called risk.\nI, like Anne Lindbergh, like many of you here, I suppose, really do want\nto go. And here's the thing. I'm far more concerned about not taking the risks\ninvolved with exploration than risks that are involved with doing what we are\ndoing. I mean, suppose we just get ultrasafe and stay in bed--that's risky too.\nAs an ocean scientist, as chief scientist of NOAA back in the early '90s, they\nstarted calling me the \"Sturgeon General\" because I expressed concern about\nwhat was happening to the planet. This is, after all, our life support system.\nAnd, as any astronaut will tell you, you learn everything you can about your\nlife support system, and then you do everything you can to take care of your\nlife support system. And we haven't learned a great deal yet about our own life\nsupport system. This blue planet--less than 5 percent of the ocean has been\nseen, let alone explored. And I don't think the risks are really worth talking about\nwhen you consider the gains and the risks of not taking whatever modest risks\nthere are out there.\nI am concerned about the health of this planet--our life support system--\nstarting with the Earth's blue heart, the ocean. I think of the ocean as the engine\nthat drives climate and weather, regulates temperature, generates most of the\noxygen, and absorbs much of the carbon dioxide.\nIt's home for 97 percent of life on Earth, and\nthat's not surprising considering that that's where\n97 percent of the water on Earth is. As Chris\nMcKay--one of my great heroes--says, \"Water is\nthe single non-negotiable thing that life requires.\"\nHuh! There it is.\nIn the past half century, we've learned more\nabout the ocean than during all preceding human\nhistory, but it's not good enough--there's so much\nmore that we need to know. And, at the same time\nthat we've learned more, we've lost more. In the\nlast half century--the last half century!--90\npercent of the big fish in the ocean have been\nextracted. Ninety percent! Think of it. Half the\ncoral reefs are either gone or they're in really a\nsharp state of decline. Kelp forests from Tasmania\nto Alaska are not in the same good health that\nthey were 50 years ago. They, too, are in a state of decline. I hope you enjoyed\nthat tasty bit of halibut that you had last night--those of you who consumed\nExploring in the deep with a JIM suit. (Image ID: nur07562, National Under-\nsearch Research Program (NURP) Collection Photographer: W. Busch)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nit--because they're among the big fish--along with tuna, sharks, swordfish,\ngrouper, snapper, California rockfish--that have plummeted in my lifetime, in\nyour lifetime, because we are so good at extracting things from our life support\nsystem before we even understand how it works.\nSo think about what the risks will be of not taking the relatively small risks\ninvolved in exploration today. The chemistry of the planet is changing. What does\nthat mean to the little critters that are out there? Especially the microbes that\nreally dominate the way this planet works? Won't take much to set off a whole\nnew suite of events based on the changes in chemistry that are taking place now.\nOur security as a species is at risk for our reluctance at not taking the relatively\nsmall risks involved with what some regard as cutting-edge exploration. As never\nbefore, we really do have a chance to get out there and make a difference--and\nmaybe as never again. I want to show you now something to cause you to dream\nwith me about what the potential is. Why aren't we out there in the ocean? Why\naren't there fleets of little submarines like there are fleets of aircraft up in the\nsky? There is a little one-person sub called \"Deep Worker\", built up in Canada.\nThere are, I think, about fifteen or sixteen of them in operation now around\nthe world. For five years as the explorer-in-residence--what a cool title!--at the\nNational Geographic Society, I had the chance to engage more than a hundred\npeople--scientists, teachers, administrators, paper-pushers, economists--to\nlearn how to drive those little subs. They're so simple to learn how to drive that\neven a scientist can do it.\nAnd we did it, looking at the coastline of the United States, focusing on the\nsmall but promising counterpart to the national parks on land--marine sanctuaries.\nThere are a few. It amounts to less than one percent of our coastal waters, but,\nnonetheless, we've made a start toward protecting our life support system\naround this country. By getting into one of these little subs--one atmosphere, no\ndecompression--we could go as much as two thousand feet. It's a start toward the\nultimate 35,800 feet--the deepest part of the ocean, 7 miles. Why shouldn't we\ninvest in fleets of little subs that can take anybody who wants to go for whatever\nreason? Whether you want to write poetry or whether you want to write a business\nplan or whether you're an explorer interested in science, this is the major part of\nour planet. It's blue! It's water. And it's largely still inaccessible.\n\"\n\"\nTHIS BLUE PLANET--LESS THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE OCEAN HAS BEEN SEEN,\nLET ALONE EXPLORED. AND I DON'T THINK THE RISKS ARE REALLY WORTH\nTALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE GAINS AND THE RISKS OF NOT\nTAKING WHATEVER MODEST RISKS THERE ARE OUT THERE.\n\"\n\"\nSYLVIA EARLE\nDEEP OCEAN EXPLORATION\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nI was among the first in this country, back in the early 1950s, to enjoy\nusing one of the first aqualungs that first came into the country. I salute Jacques\nCousteau almost every day for giving me a passport into the ocean, and I love\nthe concept of being able to fly freely in the sea as a diver. And that's what these\nlittle subs do, too. As a diver, all by yourself, people say, \"Aren't you afraid all\nby yourself?\" Well, again, what else do we do all by ourselves? I love subs of all\nsorts: 1 person, 2 person, 6 person, 30 person, or passenger subs that take people\nout into the sea at least down to 50 meters or so these days. What is stopping\nus from gaining access to anywhere in the ocean we want to go? Anytime we\nwant to go? We need to understand what's out there, what's down there. This is\na moment in time--a crossroads in time--when we know that our life support\nsystem is in trouble. This part of the solar system is changing, this blue planet,\nthis Earth. With all due respect to our goal of going elsewhere in the solar system\nto set up housekeeping--and I love the idea of going to Mars, I'd love to be able\nto go myself and come back--the fact is that, look as far as we might, the Earth is\nthe place that, for the foreseeable future, we have got to come to grips with and\ntake care of it. That's really what is at risk: our future.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nOcean Futures\nLadies and gentlemen, it is a great privilege and honor to be here, and very\nhumbling, knowing who is here in this audience. And many of you I've had the opportunity\nto meet, and I have a lot of respect for what you do.\nThe symposium's invitation states that NASA was created to pioneer the future. I\nwill always remember the difficult times of trying to sell television programs with some of\nthe networks in the United States. The people who were putting up millions of dollars were\nasking my father,\"So, Captain, what do you expect to find?\" And his answer to those people\nwho were about to make major commitments was, \"If I knew, I wouldn't go.\"\nThis extraordinary desire to see what's on the other side of the hill is what has animated\nall of us. This cannot be done if we do not have a commitment to preserve and protect the\nresources of the present. It is a dream as old as consciousness to explore the stars, so we\nmust continue to explore, but with an equal commitment to protect the quality of life on\nEarth, which we are not doing. It will do no good to send people into space or underwater if\nit becomes an escape from intolerable conditions here at home. That being said, as famous\na pioneer underwater as my father was, and his team, they took risks they didn't even know\ni\nl\ni\ni\nCalypso and Alcyone.

Jean-Michel has produced over 70 films and been awarded the Emmy, the Peabody Award,\nthe 7 d'Or--the French equivalent of the Emmy, and the Cable Ace Award.\n\nexisted, compelled by the adventure of what they were seeing for the first time.\nThey took those risks because they were inspired by the importance of the\nrealm they had entered, just as space explorers were, are now, and will always\ncontinue to be. Having seen the world underwater, my father then dedicated his\nlife to protecting it. He also came to appreciate that everything is connected, and,\nthus, he became concerned about the water systems of the planet, the land, the\natmosphere, and the quality of life for people.\nI think NASA is in the same position relative to its view of life on Earth\nfrom space. When my father pushed me overboard at the age of seven, I had a\ntank on my back and, in those days, children did not argue with their parents,\nso I've been a scuba diver ever since. Some of my earliest views were formed in\nthe middle of the night, when my father would wake me and my brother out of a\nsound sleep to stand on the terrace in our south-of-France home to look at the\nsky, full of stars, planets, and the Moon. We were learning about nature firsthand.\nJacques Cousteau was a dreamer, full of excitement to explore outer space when\nit was only the subject of science fiction at the time. Fifty-nine years ago, he\npushed me overboard.\nI think my father and his team were willing to take great risks, risks they\nrealized they couldn't even describe or predict, because first, looking up at the\nstars and then into the oceanic abyss, they knew the greater risk was ignorance.\nThis is as true today. Our invitation also asks, \"Why are sacrifices made in the\nname of exploration more notable than the losses incurred in the course of\neveryday life?\" I think it is the nature of our species to focus on drama. We don't\naccept short-term, immediate, dramatic risks, but long-term, slow, less dramatic\nyet more important risks we ignore--i.e., species lost, pollution, and reducing\nthe habitability of the planet for life. We get excited about lives lost from short-\nterm, dramatic events, but are oblivious to thousands of people losing lives from\nthe demise of the environmental system that provides them with income, food,\nand a quality of life.\nFor example, in the U.S., it is estimated that the amount of oil runoff flowing\nfrom urban pavements into the oceans creates the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez\nevery eight months, as reported by the Pew Ocean Commission. Yet, not a word\nreaches the masses, and even if it did, there would be little outcry. Even the fact\nthat six thousand children die every day from lack of access to clear water creates\nOPENING PHOTO:\nThe Bahamas viewed from space.\n(NASA Image Number ISS007-E-8916)\n\"\n\"\nTHE PEOPLE WHO WERE PUTTING UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE ASKING MY FATHER,\n\"SO, CAPTAIN, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO FIND?\" AND HIS ANSWER TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO\nWERE ABOUT TO MAKE MAJOR COMMITMENTS WAS, \"IF I KNEW, I WOULDN'T GO.\"\n\"\n\"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nno outrage. We seem to accept, even ignore, these pernicious risks. I think it is\nthe duty of those of us privileged with the ability to explore to point out both the\ndramatic and the mundane, but certainly more significant, events.\nSo, how can we look with vision and commitment into the future of space\ntravel? I think we have to do it by mounting rearview mirrors on our spacecraft.\nBy that, I mean that, while moving farther into space, we simultaneously take\nthe opportunity to include equipment that will continue to monitor with greater\nsophistication the state of the Earth. Basically, we cannot fulfill our dream of\nexploration in outer space or inner space if home base is unlivable. NASA is\npowerfully positioned to create what I call the Global Ocean Network, which at\nour Ocean Futures Society we have started working on in a conceptual phase,\nwhereby it would be a way to constantly monitor from space with an array of\nvessel buoys, habited buoys, drifting buoys, whatnot, both bringing the dramatic\nevents and long-term trends in the planet's water system. As Sylvia just said, it\nis our life support system.\nThis is nothing new. I have a report right here, given to me a\nfew days ago, from a 1971 meeting of my father at NASA Headquarters\nwith Dr. Wernher von Braun and NASA officials. My father presented\nthe case for a global monitoring system \"to monitor the primary\nproduction of life in the ocean and to monitor the deterioration of life\nin the ocean resulting from human activities and from natural forces...\"\nHis dream was for NASA to launch satellites to monitor sophisticated\nocean sensors. Much has been done in this direction, but now it needs\nto be part of every endeavor. We need to take an aggressive marketing\nand public relations approach to selling the future and the risk to the\npublic, something we've not done well. We need to engage them in\nrealistically assessing risk and prioritizing issues. We need to motivate\nand mobilize them to take personal action and political action to\nensure we have an acceptable future for our children. The future based\non the direction we are [currently] headed is unacceptable.\nNASA is in an unprecedented position to participate in necessary\nnew directions. Infusing future space exploration with stewardship\nof our planet, we will accomplish two things that have to do with\nrisk: We will have upped the ante in terms of what we can gain by\nrisking human life to further our knowledge, and we will have shown\nour regard for that human life by protecting it in the only place we\nknow it to exist. There will always be brave men and women willing\nto risk their lives for exploration in outer space and underwater. We\nneed to dignify their courage, and possibly deaths, by making sure we are doing\neverything to protect not only their lives, but the life-giving system of the planet\nthrough their work as well.\nI'd like to tell you why we take risks. This incredible planet of ours, the\nonly one with sufficient quantities of water that we know of to have the kind of\nsophisticated life like we have, has inspired a lot of people like my dad to pioneer.\nJacques Cousteau, the French sea researcher,\nin 1973, addressing members of the press on his\nexperiences during an Antarctic expedition with\nthe oceanographic ship, Calypso.\n(NASA Image # 73-H-164)\nJEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU\nOCEAN FUTURES\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nThey didn't know what they really were doing. They were very cautious. And most\nof them, anyway, stayed alive. But it was touch and feel. It was this unbelievable\ncuriosity that animated them and opened the ocean world to millions of people.\nIn South Africa, I was taught to dive and hang on to the back of the dorsal\nfin of a 14-foot great white shark. Was I taking risks? Very calculated risks, much\nless than when I cross Fifth Avenue in New York. But in the process, we're making\npeople understand that these animals are part of our system.\nWas I taking risks when I wanted for the first time to go down with a\nship, sink with a ship, a Russian frigate that was made into a dive site? I always\nwondered, what happened in the minds of those people as they sank with\ntheir ships, the captains, the people in charge? A few months ago we were in\nthe middle of the Pacific working on an island, Laysan, where nobody lives, and\nfinding all our refuse. Fifty-two countries were represented there with probably\ntens of thousands of tons [of refuse] just lying there with fishing nets and debris.\nWe are using our ocean, we're using our own home, as a garbage can, a universal\nsewer. At some point nature will say, I can't handle it anymore, and we are getting\nsigns of that today.\nI believe that exploration and taking risks is what is going to change\nthe face of the planet today. We have new equipment, free breathers, new fins\ndesigned by imitating the flip of an Orca, new lights, new submersibles, new\ncommunication systems which, as Sylvia just rightfully said, will allow us to\nexplore not just the five percent we've explored, but a hundred percent. And\nthat's what's going to make us do the right thing. Because how can we protect\nwhat we don't understand?\nSo this risk we're taking is for the bettering of the quality of life for the\nhuman species on the planet. Those sharks we were diving with at 200 feet of\ndepth, they don't care. We do. We want them to stay there just like anything else.\nI will never forget the comparison that my dad made one day when he told\nme, \"You know, the planet is like an airplane with wings. Every time you remove\na rivet you are removing a species. At some point, it may just collapse.\" We don't\nwant to go there.\nAnd the decisions that our brains, that our industries, and political\nrepresentatives anywhere in the world will make will allow us to fulfill our dream\nand take calculated risks. And that, I believe, is what animates every one of us here.\nI have no job, I have a passion, and I will not retire until I'm switched off.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nl\ni\nRi\ni\nExp orat on and the\nsk-Reward Equat on\nDefining and controlling risk in exploration operations is a\ntough and continuous challenge that requires the application of a range of methods from\nthe qualitative to the quantitative, and, ultimately, to be successful, requires consistent\napplication of informed good judgment.\nWe've already heard a lot of very insightful themes from the previous speakers, and you're\ngoing to hear some of them again from me, but possibly from a slightly different perspective.\nFor my entire adult life I've been in relatively risky professions, starting out as a scuba diving\ninstructor and boat captain in the Caribbean, where your job is basically to keep people from\nkilling themselves, and you see it all, from people who sit on sea urchins and scream and spit\nout their regulator and their false teeth, and then go shooting to the surface, to people who go\nchasing after aggressive tiger sharks. So you learn to expect that anything can happen.\nAfter that, I worked as a commercial deep-sea diver doing subsea construction in the\noffshore oilfield, and then, later, as vice president of the world's largest subsea contractor.\nCurrently, I'm an astronaut, and involved in doing high-risk human research for space\ndecompression procedures.\nMi\nl\nchae L. Gernhardt, Ph.D.\nNASA Astronaut\nNASA selected Michael Gernhardt as an astronaut in March 1992. His technical assignments have\nincluded development of nitrox diving to support training for the Hubble Space Telescope repair and a\nvariety of Space Station extravehicular activity (EVA) developments; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM)\nat Mission Control Center, Houston, during various Shuttle missions; and leading an international\nresearch team in developing a new exercise prebreathe protocol that improved the safety and efficiency\nof space walks from the International Space Station. Gernhardt presently serves as a member of\nthe astronaut office EVA branch and as principle investigator of the Prebreath Reduction Program\nand manager of Johnson Space Center's Environmental Physiology Laboratory. A four flight veteran,\nGernhardt has logged over 43 days in space, including 4 spacewalks totaling 23 hours and 16 minutes.\nHe was a mission specialist on STS-69 in 1995, STS-83 in 1997, STS-94 in 1997, and STS-104 in 2001.\nGernhardt is assigned to the crew of STS-119.\n\nAs a professional, it's important that you address the risk-reward equation.\nBasically, that equation states that the utility, or the degree of success, is equal\nto the probability of success times the reward, minus the probability of failure\ntimes the cost. As a professional, if you don't balance this equation properly and\nend up most of the time with a really large, positive number, you're either not\ngoing to live very long, or, if you're in business and you're killing your people,\nyou're not going to stay in business very long.\nCommercial diving is potentially a very dangerous business, but, in fact,\nit's actually safer than many forms of nonprofessional scuba diving, because we\nunderstand that it's risky and we plan for those risks. Some of the nonprofessionals\ntend to focus more on the reward component of this equation. It would be really\nneat to dive on this wreck or really great to go in this cave. And, unfortunately,\nthey don't understand the risk side until it's too late.\nAs individuals involved in these operations, it's vitally important that you\nunderstand and accept the risks that you're getting into. And it's also important\nthat the individuals have direct control of the risks through their own actions.\nCommercial deep-sea diving is potentially very dangerous. Some of the\nwork that we do includes very complicated construction tasks that would\nbe dangerous on dry land. An example is a hyperbaric welding job, where, in\norder to do code-quality structural repairs of offshore platforms, we actually\nhave to weld in a dry environment, because in wet welding, the water quenches\nthe weld so fast you get hydrogen embrittlement. So we have to design these\nmultipiece habitats that we have to install around the tubular truss structure of\nthe platform, install seals, dewater the habitat, and then go inside and weld in a\ndry environment.\nThese are challenging operations at very high forces. A lot of time you're\nworking in current conditions, at close to maximum aerobic capacity. These\noperations would be dangerous on dry land, but we do them at depths of up to\n1,000 feet, under extreme physiological stresses, working in a dynamic, harsh\nenvironment that is capable of radical changes over short time periods. And\nmany times, you're working in limited or zero visibility on the muddy bottom.\nAnd, so, you've got to realize that that's risky, and plan and address those risks.\nIn my mind, I divide risk into two categories. There's what I would call the\ncorporate or programmatically controlled risk, and these risks relate primarily to\nthe design of the equipment, the degrees of redundancy, the reliability, things of\nthat nature. An example is a saturation, helium-oxygen saturation, diving system.\nAnd if you're not familiar with saturation diving, we use this method to increase the\nefficiency of the amount of bottom time we get for the amount of decompression\ntime. If we were to work at 500 feet for 30 minutes, it would take over 24 hours to\ndecompress. Once you stay on the bottom 24 hours or longer, the partial pressure\nof inert gas in your inspired breathing mixture comes to equilibrium with the\ntension of gas dissolved in your blood and tissues. Then your blood and tissues\nwill not uptake any more inert gas, and it will take 5 days to decompress, whether\nyou stay on the bottom for another minute or another month.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nEquipped with SCUBA gear in waters\noff the Florida Keys, the NEEMO 5 crew\nmembers congregate near the viewing\nport of the Aquarius research habitat.\n(NASA Image # JSC-2003-E-45591)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nSo, we actually live in these pressurized habitats on the deck of the vessel,\nbreathing a helium-oxygen mixture. At 1,000 feet it's less than one percent\noxygen. Then we transfer under pressure into a diving bell, we make a seal on\nthe bell, the bell is deployed overboard, and acts as an elevator to transport the\ndiver to the subsea worksite. Then we lock out of the bell, do eight hours work,\nreenter the bell, and make a seal-return to the surface under pressure where we\ntransfer into the living chamber on the deck of the vessel or platform. With a\nsix-person crew, we do 24-hour-a-day operations. That results in about 20 hours\nof working bottom time per 24 hour-day. We spend a month under pressure, so\nthe working-time to decompression-time ratio is about five, compared to the\nsurface diving position where you're less than point one.\nThis is a very efficient form of diving; it's very challenging with respect\nto the life support systems. Minor changes in the oxygen percentage can mean\nthe difference between hypoxia and acute oxygen toxicity. Same kinds of limits\non the carbon dioxide. Temperature and humidity are very sensitive at these\nextreme pressures and gas densities. A temperature swing of a few degrees, a few\npercentage points of relative humidity change, is the difference between comfort\nand discomfort. And larger swings than that are life and death.\nOn top of that, we're locking out, we're working in an oilfield environment,\nwhere you can bring trace contaminants back into the habitat. So all this has\nto be accounted for ahead of time, and controlled, and if you do a good job at\nthe corporate level, the equipment and procedures are safe, and you're happy\nto go use it. On one of our diving support vessels, we actually have a 16-person\nsaturation habitat built in below decks. It's very much like a space station, with\nliving quarters and node. There's a thing called a moon pool, we deploy the\nbell through the bottom of the vessel. So we do all kinds of very challenging\noperations, including some very unique decompression procedures.\nI had the opportunity to work with a man named C. J. Lambertsen, who\nactually invented the oxygen rebreather, and is considered the founder of the\nUnderwater Demolition Team (UDT). He actually worked for the OSS in World\nWar II, and he was the medical director of the company I worked for, and I\nworked closely with him for almost 25 years now. Very wise guy, very smart, very\nintellectual, very good operator. And his attitude was always, what do we have to\ndo? Now, how do we do it safely? And that's the right question to ask.\nThe other question is, what can we do safely? And if you ask that question,\nyou don't have the focus. I mean, there are a lot of things you can do safely. You\ncan watch television, you can go bowling. Oops, no, you might hurt your back. So\nyou see where that's going. So it's important to define what you want to do. Then\nyou have clear focus, and you can address the risk and do it safely. If you don't\nhave a clear vision of what you are attempting to do, then its difficult to analyze\nand control the risks, and, ultimately, you can end up being less safe, even though\nyou start with a more conservative attitude.\nThe other form of risk that I categorize is what I call the individual or\nteam-controlled risk. And even though the company might provide you with\nMICHAEL GERNHARDT\nEXPLORATION AND THE RISK-REWARD EQUATION\n\nsafe diving equipment and methods, we're doing heavy-duty construction in a\ndynamic environment, and there are all sorts of risks that are directly in the\ncontrol of the diver on the end of the hose and the topside team supporting\nhim. One example is a platform repair we did off Peru. The platform was falling\ndown, and we had to burn off the old parts of the platform, and then install\nthese clamps and braces and, basically, rebuild the entire platform underwater.\nA lot of times, we're working in two or three knot currents with heavy surge\nconditions. In order to rig the repair braces and install them underwater, you've\ngot, sometimes, two crane lines and four air tugger lines that you have to direct\nin order to transfer the multiton brace into position at the underwater worksite.\nYou're down there in these heavy currents and surge with limited visibility and\nyour life support umbilical [is] potentially in the middle of all of these crane and\nair tugger lines, and if don't have good situational awareness, you can get your\numbilical hose, hand, or arm in the middle of the trajectory of these swinging\nflanges and lose your arm, or your fingers, or cut your umbilical hose. And, so,\nyou have direct control over these risks.\nI don't know how NASA's safety would quantify this kind of operation. We\ntypically approve things by testing or analysis. I don't know what you test here,\nbecause every circumstance is different, impossible to quantify, and, generally,\nunrepeatable. And, so, these risks are very much in your control, and your skill,\nand the supervisor's assessment of your capabilities, is the only level of control\nof these risks, along with very good planning and teamwork.\nOne of the observations that I've made is that to do this kind of stuff\nsafely, you have to have the right attitude, you have to plan it, and you have to\nwork with your team, your topside team, and the people controlling all these\ncrane lines, and you have to go in with a good plan, and you have to be confident\nand aggressive.\nAnd the people that I saw getting hurt were the people who had checked\nout a little bit. Their heart really wasn't into it, and they wouldn't attack the pre-\ndive planning, and then they'd get in and they'd hesitate at the wrong moment,\nor something like that, and they would have the accident.\nAnd I think the same observation would be true for an organization. If\nyou become so risk-averse that you indiscriminately apply your resources\n\" \"\nSO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING,\nAND BE CONFIDENT AND AGGRESSIVE, AND UNDERSTAND THE\nRISKS AS BEST YOU CAN AND THEN GO DO IT.\n\" \"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nto controlling trivial risk, then you don't have those resources to apply to the\nimportant risks, and you lose your focus, and you really don't accomplish that\nmuch, and, frankly, you're probably not that much safer. So it's important to keep\nfocused on what you're doing, and be confident and aggressive, and understand\nthe risks as best you can and then go do it.\nWe heard a lot of interesting and eloquent quotes from explorers, and I\nhave to tell you one of my favorite quotes was from my first Shuttle commander,\na guy named Dave Walker. Dave is no longer with us, but he was a remarkable\nhuman being and a great team builder. He actually christened our crew as the\n\"Dog Crew,\" and he gave everybody a dog name. The only condition was you\ncouldn't like your dog name. So, being a rookie and a diver, I was Underdog. His\ncall sign was Red Dog. Dave said to me, \"You know, Underdog, it's a fine line\nbetween bleep and bleep hot.\" I can't say it exactly the way he said it. The bleep\nstarts with an \"S.\" Dave had probably known both sides of that line, so he really\nunderstood that. It is a fine line. It is a fine line between being a cowboy and\ntaking too many risks, and then, on the other side, being so risk averse that you\ndon't get anything done and you're not as safe as you should be.\nNow, as far as the risk-reward equation and the commercial diving\nindustry, we have to be safe or we don't have a business. It is the right thing to\ndo. You don't calculate that we're willing to lose this many people or anything\nlike that. You do the very best you can to make things safe. You also make them\ncost effective and efficient. What we have done over the years is, we started out\nwith the divers in a hands-on environment. We have slowly evolved the human\nback from the direct operational environment. Instead of divers having to go into\nsaturation and incur all these physiological stresses, we had one-atmosphere\ndive suits. That was one step. We then stepped further back from that with the\nintroduction of remote operated vehicles [ROVs]. I was in commercial diving in\nthe late '70s and early '80s when these became widely used. It was pretty comical\nat first, because they were way oversold. The salesman would promise the oil\ncompanies that you could do all kinds of things. We actually ended up making\na lot of money as divers rescuing these things when they failed or got fouled up\non a structure. One of the key things that we learned is that it's not so much\nthe capabilities of the human or the robot; it's both sides of the interface, which\nincludes how you design the tasks to be compatible with the diver or the robot.\nThe integration of both sides of this equation results in a work system versus\njust a diving suit or a robot. What we did was work with the oil companies to\nreengineer the subsea equipment so that we could work on it easily with ROVs.\nWe ended up actually being able to produce as efficient work with these ROVs\ntoday as we could with divers in previous years. An example is what we call\nthe bucket. We actually made the task so simple that the only task was to dock\nthe ROV into this conical interface. We had different tooling packages inside\nthat would do different things, ranging from small and large valve actuations\nto mating electrical and hydraulic connectors, but to the operator, the task was\nalways the same, dock the ROV into the bucket. So you try to keep it simple.\nMICHAEL GERNHARDT\nEXPLORATION AND THE RISK-REWARD EQUATION\n\nWhen you keep things simple, it actually gives you more brain cells to apply to\nsituation awareness to know how to stay out of trouble. We have actually evolved\nsome of these concepts up to the Space Station, with the microconical interface.\nSo, the message here is to keep the task and operation as simple as you can and,\nultimately, that makes it safer, because you have more reserve capabilities and\nsituational awareness to deal with the unexpected. When you plan an operation\nright at the limits of your capabilities, your safety margins go down.\nPeople always ask me, \"Was it more dangerous in commercial diving or the\nastronaut business?\" I think the answer to that is that in the space business,\ngetting to the work site is a lot more dangerous than riding the boat out and\ncoming back. But in commercial diving, once you're at the work site and dealing\nwith all these dynamic forces and physiologic stresses, it is probably riskier than\ndoing a spacewalk.\nOne of the things I think will happen, though, as we evolve to planetary\nexploration is that instead of training for a whole year to do a spacewalk and having\na whole ground team behind you, we're going to be doing EVA [Extravehicular\nActivity] every day, with a plan that has been developed, at best, the day before and\none that is likely to change many times during the course of the EVA. The balance\nof risk is going to shift between the corporately controlled risk on the redundancy\nof the vehicle to the personally controlled risk when you're doing these EVA\noperations. We need to have people who can make good judgments and good\ndecisions in a relatively unstructured and dynamic operational environment.\nI participated in one of the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment\nMission Operations), which is a program we have going with NOAA [National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration]. The underwater habitat they have off\nthe Keys is a great analogue. We actually lock out, do coral reef science, and spend\nnine hours a day in the water. They have remote way stations where you refill\nyour tanks. I have proposed that this is a great analogue to use to parameterize\nthat operational space. How far away from the habitat are you? What are your\nconsumables? How long will it take you to get back to the habitat, and how much\nair will you consume? You have to make all these real time decisions about when\nto refill tanks, when to start and stop working, when to head back to the habitat,\net cetera. The NOAA team has really tight flight rules. If you come back to the\nhabitat with less than 500 psi or one second beyond your flight plan, you're\nbusted. You're not going to dive anymore. It really builds good decision-making.\nThey have done over 27,000 excursion dives with a perfect safety record.\nThe notion would be to parameterize this operational space, and then ask\nyourself the question: If we're going to work on the Moon and we want to explore\na 200 kilometer radius, then what life support do we need? How fast do our\ntransport vehicles need to go? Where should the way stations be? There is a lot\nthat we can learn from land and subsea analogues that we should be applying to\nour mission design well before we set foot on the Moon or Mars.\nI am going to transition quickly from subsea to space on the topic of\ndecompression. I will also talk about the difference between qualitative and\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nquantitative risk control. We have to decompress in space because we work in\nlow-pressure space suits, and we want the pressure to be as low as possible so\nthat we have minimal forces and torques across the suits so we can work. We\nactually have to get rid of nitrogen much the same way a diver does.\nOn the trials of the Shuttle decompression procedures that we have all used,\nwe had 25 percent decompression sickness. You ask yourself, is that acceptable\nor not? It turns out there are some things about altitude DCS (decompression\nsickness) that are much different than diving. If you talk to the divers here, they\nwill say you've got to have way less than five percent. In commercial diving, we had\nabout 0.01 percent. Altitude decompression sickness\nis different, primarily because you pre-breathe the\noxygen and undersaturate your brain and spinal cord,\nso we don't [have] nearly as many serious symptoms\nof DCS that we see in diving.\nWhen they did the Shuttle ground trials,\nthey came up with 25 percent DCS, and they had a\ncommittee come in and they said, \"Well, what do you\nthink? Is this safe or not?\" You can find anybody to say\nit's safe or it's unsafe. It turns out that we have not\nhad any decompression sickness in flight, probably\nbecause the ground model was not that accurate. I\ndon't have time to go into all those details, but the\npoint is that it was the assessment of acceptable risk\nwas very subjective.\nWhen I started the pre-breathing production\ndevelopment for the procedure we are now using on\nthe Space Station, I took a whole year with a large\nteam to define what acceptable risk was. I pulled in\nthe Navy and the Air Force, the flight directors, who\nare great guys, who are really great at analyzing data\nand making decisions, the flight surgeons, and the\nastronaut office. When we had the first meeting, I said, \"Everybody in this room\nhas an opinion about what acceptable DCS risk is. Recognize it is only your\nopinion.\" We proceeded over the course of a year to pull in all the data we could,\nanalyze the data, and when we extracted the last little bit of information out of\nthat, we finally made the decisions.\nThere was a lot of talk yesterday about staging things. We actually staged\ninto this. You couldn't get a consensus right off the bat as to what acceptable\nDCS risk was, but I took the tack of saying, what's the highest risk we could have\nand still build the Space Station? We had a policy that if you had Type I DCS on\nan EVA and it resolved, you could go EVA again in 72 hours. This was consistent\nwith Navy and Air Force procedures. If you have the second Type I hit on this\nsame mission, then you were out. If you had Type II, serious DCS, you were also\nout of the rotation.\nAstronaut Michael L. Gernhardt, mission specialist, is pictured\nduring the 16 September 1995 extravehicular activity (EVA) which\nwas conducted in and around Space Shuttle Endeavour's cargo bay.\n(NASA Image # STS69-714-046)\nMICHAEL GERNHARDT\nEXPLORATION AND THE RISK-REWARD EQUATION\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nWe then did a Monte Carlo simulation of the entire Space Station assembly\nand maintenance model, applying this policy and subjecting it to the constraint\nthat we be 95 percent confident that we would always have two crew members to\ndo an EVA. That defined the uppermost risk we could have. We then looked at\nother factors and actually ended up picking a level of DCS risk of 15 percent at\nupper 95 percent confidence level, which, [as it] turns out, is below a threshold\nwhere there has ever been a report of Type II DCS in our database. We do these\ntrials with human subjects. Subject safety is our number one priority. We have\ndefined very explicitly what the accept conditions are. Even though the research is\ndifficult, it is pretty easy to make a decision, because we have prospectively defined\nthe acceptable risk criteria. You design the experiment, you do the trial, and, if it\nmeets it, you're great. If it doesn't, you reject it and test the next protocol.\nSome of these quantitative risk definitions and control techniques would\nbe applicable to other aspects of vehicle and mission safety design. Statistics\nare a good tool, to be used in conjunction with informed good judgment, not a\nreplacement for it. It's a fine line that we will have to walk as we move forward\nwith the next generation of exploration missions. We will need to understand and\naccept that they are risky, define clearly what we want to do, define and control\nthe risks as well as we possibly can, and then go do the mission recognizing that\nwe have done everything practical to control the risks, but that we will never\ntotally eliminate them.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nTitanic and Other Reflections\nI am also honored to be part of this august panel, which includes\ntwo of my heroes from the undersea world, and some of the people I'm just meeting today.\nWe live in an age when the land area of our planet has been explored, mapped, imaged,\nsettled, and exploited for whatever it has to offer. It's definitional that what remains to be\nexplored are the most remote, inaccessible, and inhospitable parts of our world, or places\nthat are not a part of our world at all. This basically means that the easy stuff has been done,\nif you want to consider polar exploration and all the great pioneering work in the ocean the\neasy stuff. The hard stuff is in front of us, and it means we are now confronting even more\nhostile and extreme conditions and requiring more sophisticated technology and support\nsystems in order to do our exploration. Correspondingly, we are facing more complex and\nsubtle forms of risk than ever before.\nI have lived with risk for my entire professional career as an action film director. I\nregularly asked people, with a completely straight face, to set themselves on fire, to flip their\ncar over, to leap out of an exploding building, to ride on top of a tractor-trailer truck that's\non its side skidding, to fly a helicopter underneath an overpass with two feet of clearance on\neither side of the rotor tip, and even to ride a sinking ship down underwater.\nRambo: First Blood\nand\nin\nAliens of the Deep.\ni\ni\nl\nBorn in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, James Cameron grew up near Niagra Falls. In 1971, he moved\nto Brea, California, where he studied physics at Fullerton College while working as a machinist and,\nlater, a truck driver. The1984 sleeper hit, The Terminator, launched his directorial career. Since that time,\nCameron has served as writer, producer, director, and/or editor on such films as\nPart II, Aliens, The Abyss, Point Break, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies,\nTitanic. Cameron's\nfilms have also earned numerous nominations and awards from a variety of organizations, culminating\nTitanic's 11 Academy Awards, including Cameron's three Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction, and\nBest Editing. In 1995, Cameron made 12 dives to the Titanic in preparation for his feature film. Cameron\nhas made a total of 38 dives in the Mir submersibles. His most recent expedition to the hydrothermal\nvents is the subject of the IMAX film,\nJames Cameron\nWr ter/D rector, Undersea Exp orer\n\nIn twenty years of directing stunts and action and pyrotechnic effects, I've\nnever actually had a serious injury on the set. That is because of application of\na fairly rigorous and disciplined process. It is not as institutionalized as it is\nwith NASA, but it has its own special rigor. Before any major stunt, or gag as\nwe call them, I would walk the set myself, looking at every piece of rigging and\nturning over every possibility in my head. At that moment on a shoot when all\nthe lights and the cameras are set up, it is the culmination of months of planning,\nengineering, testing, and rigging. The industry's leading experts up to that point\nhave done it all. (I would just like to point out that the failure of the Genesis\nspacecraft was not due to the Hollywood stunt pilot. Of course, now we know\nthat the science has been recovered, so it's all good.)\nThese experts have decades and decades of experience doing stunts,\nexplosions, car gags, fire, and whatever it is that we might be doing. But still,\neven after every single one of these people has signed off, I walk the set. I just\ncall a complete hold. I walk the set. I look at the rigging. I ask questions. I think\nabout it: What if this happens? What if that happens? Even though we have been\nover it and over it, I call that last minute hold, and I walk the set. I'm looking for\nsomething which is something that I've over the years come to call the x-factor,\nsome previously unseen detail or some exotic combination of variables which\ncould cause the stunt to go horribly wrong.\nI guess my point here is that the personal touch is critical, and taking\nindividual responsibility is critical, for everybody in the chain. Systems protocols\nand institutional checks and balances are important, and they add great robustness\nto risky operations. However, those very checks and balances can often inhibit\nindividuals from speaking up or taking action because they make the assumption\nthat someone else has approved it. Someone else is going to catch it. Someone\nelse has responsibility, and they don't catch it before it's too late.\n[When] we made the movie Titanic, we began that production in a very\nunusual way. We actually dove to the wreck site of Titanic twelve times. It's\nin 12,500 feet of water in the North Atlantic. We set ourselves some pretty\nambitious goals. We were going to build a new camera system so that we could\noperate a 35mm movie camera outside the submersible, seeing ambient pressure\nat 5,500 psi. We were going to build new lighting equipment. We were even going\nto build our own remotely-operated vehicles so we could explore the Titanic\nwreck internally. I had some experience as a project manager developing new\ntechnology for underwater filming on the movie The Abyss, and that prepared me,\nto a certain extent, for the difficulty of engineering this new equipment. Nothing\nprepared me for the chaos introduced when we took that whole circus to sea on\na research ship. We weathered three hurricanes and multiple equipment failures,\nbut we managed to prevail and get the images of the wreck. In that process, I got\nbitten by the deep ocean exploration bug.\nAfter the success of Titanic, the movie, I found myself less interested\nin Hollywood filmmaking and more interested in the challenges of ocean\nphotography and exploration. So, over the next few years, we developed new\nOPENING PHOTO:\nPart of the railing from the bow section of\nthe Titanic. Courtesy of James Cameron.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nimages and robotic exploration technology. Then I had to go out and raise the\nmoney by making films, in order to pay for it. So we wound up returning to the\nTitanic wreck site in 2001, because I figured if I couldn't raise money to go to the\nTitanic wreck I couldn't raise money to do anything. We took our spanking new\n3-D digital imaging system to capture the coolest stereo images of the wreck that\nwe could before it disintegrates, and we made a film called Ghosts of the Abyss,\nwhich was for the IMAX 3-D theaters.\nWe also created two very tiny and advanced ROVs [Remotely Operated\nVehicles] which could fly untethered inside the wreck. They were untethered in\nterms of a power umbilical, but they had a data tether, which was a spool of fiber\noptic, kind of like a wire-guided torpedo. We were able to explore the wreck,\nroom by room and deck by deck. These were launched from the submersibles\nafter we landed on the Titanic wreck, and they were flown inside the wreck by\nmyself and two other pilots. With these bots, we were able to capture some pretty\namazing images inside the wreck in spaces which could never have been seen by\nhuman eyes and which probably will never be seen directly by human eyes. We\nwere able to reveal in the lights and video cameras of these tiny robots a kind of\nlost grandeur of Titanic, which still exists deep inside that wreck.\nFor me, that was the greatest adventure imaginable. If I wasn't hooked\nbefore, I was certainly hooked then. Of course, all the time I was very cognizant\nof the risks and, as the person heading the team, the expedition leader, so to\nspeak, it was my responsibility. The buck stopped with me, so I was continuing\nto apply my lessons learned from my underwater motion picture filmmaking\nexperience, to this new realm. Of course, we had a lot of problems, and we\nhad equipment failures, and we got hit by another three hurricanes. Then the\nSeptember 11th attacks cut short our expedition. It was certainly a bizarre and\nironic experience to be, literally, down at the bottom of the ocean, at the site\nof the defining disaster of the first part of the 20th century, while probably the\ndefining disaster of the first part of the 21st century was taking place over our\nheads without our knowledge.\nHaving made 24 dives at this point by the end of the second expedition\nto explore the Titanic, I am now pretty continuously mindful of the lessons of\nTitanic as I continue with other exploration projects and any projects involving\n\" \"\nTITANIC HAS A VALUE AS A KIND OF PARABLE. THE LESSONS\nLEARNED ARE STILL VALUABLE FOR US IN OUR CONTINUING\nEXPLORATION OF THE SEA AND OF SPACE.\n\" \"\nJAMES CAMERON\nTITANIC AND OTHER REFLECTIONS\n\nrisk of any kind. The lessons learned from the sinking of Titanic caused sweeping\nreform of the maritime safety code in its time. But in the abstract, Titanic has\na value as a kind of parable. The lessons learned are still valuable for us in our\ncontinuing exploration of the sea and of space.\nTitanic was sunk primarily by institutional momentum. Just as the inertia\nof the ship was too great for the crew to be able to turn it in time to avoid hitting\nthe iceberg, the inertia of their methodology was at least equally responsible for\nthe collision. It was the policy of sea captains at that time to maintain full speed\nuntil they'd spotted the ice and then slow down only when it became absolutely\nnecessary. This was for economic reasons, reasons of straight commerce. This\nwas simply how it was done.\nThe Titanic's captain was due to retire after this one last prestigious\nvoyage, after a long and unblemished career. He was captaining on the maiden\nvoyage of the largest vessel ever created. His lifetime of experience taught him\nthat on a crystal clear night, in a flat calm ocean, he was safe maintaining full\nspeed, despite the Marconi-gram sitting in his pocket warning of a huge ice field\nahead. With a warning to the officer of the watch to be extra vigilant, he went to\nsleep as the ship barreled on toward its fate. Now, was this arrogance or hubris,\nas many have said? I don't think so, not really. It was simply business as usual.\nThese new ships didn't handle like the previous ones. They took longer to stop\nor to turn. So, everything he knew was actually wrong in that exact circumstance.\nThe old operating methods didn't really apply. The conditions had changed, but\nthe methods hadn't kept up. It also required an unlikely combination of elements\nto create the disaster. It was a typical cascade failure where you had a number of\nthings in series, all of which had to happen in that unique combination. The flat\ncalm of the ocean meant that no swells were breaking against the icebergs, which\nreduced the ability of the lookouts to see the icebergs in the dark. The general\nmistake made by the crew was to underestimate the perversity of the ocean, even\nwhen it seemed at its most benign.\nThere are a few interesting parallels between the sinking of the Titanic and the\nloss of the Columbia Space Shuttle and her crew. In both cases, there were unheeded\n\" \"\nTHERE ARE A FEW INTERESTING PARALLELS BETWEEN THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC AND\nTHE LOSS OF THE COLUMBIA SPACE SHUTTLE AND HER CREW. IN BOTH CASES, THERE\nWERE UNHEEDED WARNINGS. IN BOTH CASES, THE WARNINGS WERE DISMISSED, NOT OUT\nOF NEGLIGENCE, BUT FOR REASONS THAT MADE SENSE BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE AND\nINSTITUTIONAL MEMORY AT THAT MOMENT.\n\" \"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nwarnings. In both cases, the warnings were dismissed, not out of negligence, but\nfor reasons that made sense based on the experience and institutional memory at\nthat moment. In the case of Titanic, the crew was well aware, because of wireless\nmessages, that the ice lay ahead, but it was because it was the way it was always\ndone that they proceeded at full speed toward the ice field.\nWith Columbia it was known from many past missions that the foam\ncould separate from the external tank and possibly strike the orbiter, but that\nproblem had been analyzed twenty years earlier and dismissed as a serious threat\nto mission safety. When foam was observed possibly striking Columbia during\nthe launch, some engineers were concerned. But because this was the way we've\nalways done it, the warnings didn't propagate up the chain of command with\nenough force to change the outcome. So cultural momentum and institutional\nmemory had worked against Columbia just as they had worked against Titanic.\nAnother parallel is that in both accidents an unlikely series of events were\nrequired to cause catastrophe. With Titanic, it was the unlikely event of the very\nfirst iceberg that they spotted, the very first one out of a huge field of ice, happening\nto be exactly in the track of the ship. This was occurring on a night without the\nslightest swell activity to assist in spotting the berg in time. And all of this was\nhappening to a new, large class of ship whose crew was inexperienced in managing\nit in fast turns and sudden stops. With Columbia, it took the foam strike incident,\nbut then compounded it by the fact that this was one of the very few missions in\nrecent years that did not go to the ISS [International Space Station]. Had it been a\nmission to the Space Station, it is likely that the Station crew would have seen the\nlarge hole in the leading edge of the wing during the operations. Then the station\ncould have provided safe haven for the Columbia crew while everybody scrambled\nto launch a second orbiter to bring them all home safely.\nSo the vanishingly small possibility of a foam strike event actually damaging\na flight-critical component was coupled with the statistically low probability of\na non-ISS mission to create a disastrous outcome. These low-probability, high-\nconsequence events are the hardest to plan for and prevent, especially when it\nrequires a number of low-probability events in combination in order to create\na threatening scenario. Titanic teaches us to be constantly vigilant, to assume\nnothing about our methodology, to constantly ask the question \"What are we\ndoing wrong right now?\"\nI've lived with the lessons of Titanic and they've informed my judgment on\nsubsequent expedition projects. After our second expedition to Titanic, we looked for\nother projects with more and greater challenges, of course. The following spring we\nimaged the wreck of the Bismarck, which is 16,000 feet down in the North Atlantic.\nThen, we followed that up with stereo imaging at five hydrothermal vent sites along\nthe mid-Atlantic ridge. We were pretty excited by the imaging results from that,\nand I decided to make a second IMAX 3-D film about the life surrounding that\nhydrothermal vents. It was my intention with this film to draw a kind of sea/space\nconnection, on the basis of a kind of ocean analogue, where we would bring NASA\nexperts in analogue missions and let them draw the parallels between undersea\nJAMES CAMERON\nTITANIC AND OTHER REFLECTIONS\n\noperations with multiple vehicles deploying robotics. The submersibles would be\nlike a Mars surface rover on a traverse being deployed from a habitat or a base camp\nfor which the support ships or the surface ships were the analogues for that. But\nwe were also drawing a connection between the types of life that existed in these\nchemosynthesis-based environments down at these hydrothermal vents with the\nkind of life that we might encounter in extraterrestrial hydrospheres; if we were to\nfind subsurface water on Mars, if we were to find evidence of ancient life on Mars,\nit might have originated in hydrothermal communities. If Mars was once covered\nwith water or had a lot more water, that water may very well have been under ice, it\nmay have been denied the ability to photosynthesize, it may have had to live within\na chemosynthesis-based environment.\nWhen we go to Europa, we may find evidence of life there, again, probably\nsubsisting on a nonphotosynthesis basis. So we draw the sea/space connection\nin that film. I just thought I'd point that out since\nit's a room full of space buffs and we're an ocean\npanel--that there's a message there.\nIn the process of making this film, I've\nformed a partnership to buy and operate two deep\nrover submersibles, which are actually codesigned\nby Sylvia Earle. They have a depth rating of 1,000\nmeters. They are wonderful subs. You sit inside an\nacrylic sphere and you feel like you're in a kind of\nvacuole within the ocean where you have unlimited\nvisibility. You feel much better contact with the\nenvironment than you do looking through the\nsmall port windows of a typical deep submersible.\nNow, previously, we'd been working with\nthe Russian Academy of Sciences and with their\nMir submersible operation, which is a two-sub\noperation. I had a pretty good understanding of\nthe working systems of those subs and of how the\nsubmersibles were operated and how two subs are\noperated in tandem with each other in diving ops. But I was certainly in for a\nvery rude awakening by just how difficult it is to operate a manned submersible\nsystem when you're starting from scratch and when you're the one in front of\nwhom the buck stops.\nNow, we began by assembling a new team to operate and maintain the\nrovers and these were gathered from established submersible operations around\nthe U.S. and Canada. The first task was to tear the subs down to their frames for\nABS [American Bureau of Shipping] certification. Then we had to make all the\nmodifications to adapt our 3-D digital technology with the [pan and fill] systems\nand our special lighting and all of that to the submersibles. That was certainly a\ndaunting task. It took about six months, and we were barely re-certified in time\nfor our filming operations.\nDEEP ROVER, Deep Ocean Engineering's one person sub, dives to 300 meters.\n(Image ID: nur07547, National Undersearch Research Program (NURP) Collection.\nPhotographer: T. Kerby. Credit: OAR/National Undersea Research Program (NURP),\nUniversity of Hawaii)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nSo, we took our beautiful new subs to sea and met with the Russians out\nin the middle of the ocean, literally rendezvoused two ships in the middle of\nthe ocean at the mid-Atlantic ridge. We dove them together in a joint diving\noperation with the Mir submersibles. This culminated with one dive where we\nactually had four subs rendezvous at the bottom in 870 meters of water at a site\ncalled \"Lost City,\" which is a low temperature hydrothermal vent structure, a very\ninteresting place.\nThis operation was very complex logistically because it involved the\ncreation of new operational protocols for the launch and recovery of four subs\nin the same theater of operations at the same time. Tracking, communications,\nsurface ship operations, the number of submersibles in the water made all these\nsignificantly more complicated. This had ramifications through every kind of\ncontingency you could imagine. It wasn't just twice as complicated as operating\ntwo submersibles--it was some multiple. There was some square law at work\nthere. Also, we were dealing with underwater communications, which, if any of\nyou have done this, you know that such communications can be spotty at best,\nand we were dealing with them in Russian and English between four vehicles at\nthe same time on the same frequency.\nSo, we had to go through a pretty rigorous process of defining our comms\nprotocols before the fact. It was only because we had a good, long, healthy working\nrelationship with the Russians that made that possible. I found that the principles\nof risk management and safety assurance that I learned as a film director were\nactually transferable to these new situations, at least at an abstract level, and\ncertainly at a motivational level for myself, in terms of applying the same kind\nof energy and passion to the safety of the operation as to the aesthetic results\nof the film making. Now, obviously there's a very extensive body of established\nprocedure for submersible operations, and we studied that pretty rigorously, and\nwe selected our team members accordingly on the basis of their experience with\nmanned submersible ops. But it seemed like almost everything that we were\ndoing was unprecedented, and it was often difficult to find any kind of existing\nguidelines in the literature. Often, we were making up our own protocols in terms\nof what the safe procedures were for the launch of multiple subs or the manner in\nwhich we could descend them together for imaging purposes--sometimes only\na couple of meters apart, how we could operate them on the bottom (proximity\noperations), how our acoustic comms would work during the dive, how we would\nwork on the bottom with four subs together and a deployed ROV in the same\narea--a tethered vehicle.\nWe were able to pull on our experience from past dives, and we were able\nto anticipate and talk through in advance most of the contingencies that might\narise on the dive. Because of the complexity of our dive ops, we always preceded\neach dive with a joint dive ops meeting between the Russian group and the\nAmerican group. I call it the American group, but it was really a mixed group of\npeople from Australia, Canada, and everything else. The Russians called us the\n\"American group.\"\nJAMES CAMERON\nTITANIC AND OTHER REFLECTIONS\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nWe used models of the submersibles to talk through the maneuvers. The\nprocess there was very simple. Here is a model of your sub. You are the pilot of the\nsub. You move it. I will give you a voice command. You move that model the way\nyou think what I am telling you to do should result in action. This worked very\nwell. So, literally, it would be, \"Hands off. Okay, I want you to do this. I want you\nto do that.\" If they couldn't visualize it on dry land where we could hear each other\nperfectly, then it certainly wasn't going to be any better down at the bottom. Until\nwe figured out what message for voice communications was going to foul us up on\nthe bottom, we wouldn't go into the water. That was one technique.\nWe had perfected that in doing our wreck dives where we had the wreck\nas the central focusing element for what we were doing. It got more complicated\nwhen we went to these vent sites, and we were unable to physically model the\nvent sites. We had, in some cases, good microbathymetry, and, at the very least,\nwe had some decent site maps. We would use those as guides, and people would\nfly their models. We always knew in advance what we were trying to accomplish.\nThis briefing would then get synthesized into a dive plan document, which was\ndistributed to all of the various crew members. You have to appreciate that we had\ntwo observers and a pilot in each Mir, so that's six. We would have an observer\nand a pilot in each of the deep rovers, so an additional four. Ten people were\nall going in[to] the water, all having to know exactly what they were doing on a\ndaily basis. An interesting lesson here was that the task loading from a planning\nstandpoint became greater than the task load on the actual dive. In fact, I wound\nup getting most of my sleep during descent and ascent because I was spending\nthe night working through the documentation for the dive the following day. The\npace of operations was inappropriate to the scale of the logistics of what we were\ndoing. That was the thing that emerged.\nEach crew member got a dive plan which was individually tailored to their\nvehicle in terms of the timeline and their activities--the individual objectives\nfor each crew and the science activities as well. The science activities required a\nseparate pre-dive meeting by the science group who would bring us their requests\nand recommendations for modifications to the sampling equipment on the front\nof the subs.\nOne of the things I would like to express here today is the idea that, regardless\nof how much you plan, you have to be willing to accept the idea of failure. I think\nthat we are enthusiastic fans of exploration, probably everybody in the room, but\nfailure is a part of exploration. It is absolutely woven into the fabric of the act of\nexploration. By definition, exploration means you're doing something that has\nnever been done before. It is absurd to assume that activities without precedent\ncan be done in complete safety. If only the remote and hostile environments are\nyet to be explored, then we are inherently pushing the limits of human endurance\nand technical adaptation every time we advance the boundary of what is known.\nIt is absolutely important to use all of our accumulated knowledge to be\nas safe as possible. However, safety is not the most important thing. I know\nthis sounds like heresy, but it is a truth that must be embraced in order to do\n\n\"\n\"\n. . . SAFETY IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS\nLIKE HERESY, BUT IT IS A TRUTH THAT MUST BE EMBRACED IN ORDER TO\nDO EXPLORATION. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO ACTUALLY GO.\nexploration. The most important thing is to actually go. Because if safety were\nthe most important criterion, we would not go to Mars for 10,000 years, because\nonly then could we assure absolute, 100 percent success. Historically the success\nof cultures and nations has been the result of their ability to balance risk and\nreward--to put it another way, caution and boldness.\nThe problem with exploration is not the individual's perception of risk;\nit's the institutional, national, and political perception of risk. Astronauts are\nsmart people--I know a few of them. Most of them are Ph.D.s in one thing or\nanother--engineering, physics, medicine. They know that riding a pointy end of\na metal object that is screaming through the atmosphere at 20 times the speed of\na rifle bullet, being propelled by one long continuous explosion is not quite the\nsame as sitting at home in your Barcalounger.\nThey understand the dangers. They get it. They have assessed the risk.\nBut their personal dream, their vision--not for themselves, but for the entire\nhuman race--dwarfs that risk. They know the importance of what they are doing,\nbecause in their souls they are explorers. It's not the astronauts who are going\nto hold up the progress of exploration. It's the government that funds them, and\nthe people that empower that government to act, who will set the limitations.\nInstitutions gravitate inexorably toward a value system in which any risk becomes\nunacceptable, at which point exploration ceases.\nNow, we are lucky right now to be on a cusp with history where a\npresidential mandate has put NASA back on track with a renewed vision for\nexploration. NASA has reorganized around the guiding principle of exploration\nbeyond Earth's orbit. This is all very exciting, it is all very new, and it is definitely\nhappening. I believe it is a wise plan, and an affordable and achievable plan.\nBut there is one huge challenge that still needs to be overcome, even if we\ndeal with all of these short-term reorganization issues. We must overcome the\nfear of failure that may inhibit future leaders from allowing these missions to\nproceed. The challenge will be this: the only way to fail in landing humans on\nMars is to actually go. If we study the problem, we build tools and systems and\nso on for the next 50 years, we can kind of jolly ourselves along that we are really,\nhonest-to-God going to do it someday, that we're still those clever Americans\nwho put a man on the Moon back--when was that again?\nThat way we don't put our self-image at risk. But the second the button\ngets pushed and we are really going, then we enter a much higher realm of risk.\n\"\n\"\nJAMES CAMERON\nTITANIC AND OTHER REFLECTIONS\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\"Failure is not an option\" was a good credo for getting the Apollo 13 astronauts\nback home safely, but as a driving principle, it doesn't really work. Failure must\nalways be an option, or we stop being an exploring species.\nWhen I started our most recent expedition project, I called a big summit\nmeeting of all the department heads. I stood in front of a white board and put up\non the white board three slogans. The slogans were there: \"Luck is not a factor,\"\n\"Hope is not a strategy,\" \"Fear is not an option.\" Now, the first two were meant\nto convey my philosophy that to succeed in any complex task, it is essential to\nleave nothing to chance. You need to make your own luck by rigorous application\nof a robust process. You test everything in a very disciplined fashion, you don't\nguess, you know the answer, you anticipate every negative condition that might\npossibly prevail. You assume it is going to happen. You have an A plan, a B plan,\na C plan, and you assume that you're going to be on the C plan by your second\ncup on coffee on morning one of the expedition, because that's how it goes when\nyou're at sea.\nI wanted to scare them, and I wanted them to respect their adversary--not\nthe ocean, but the real adversary: entropy, which, as you know, is the tendency of\nthings to go from a state of organization to a state of chaos.\nThe third slogan, \"Fear is not an option,\"was meant to inspire the boldness\nthat actually sees you through these endeavors. It was the yin and the yang of the\nhealthy paranoia which the first two slogans represented, because without a kind\nof faith, which is not in luck and not in passive hope, but in yourself and your\nteam and in the greater meaning of what you're setting out to do, you won't find\nthe strength to go through with it.\nSo my message is, in whichever realm, be it going into space or going into\nthe deep sea, you have to balance the yin and yang of caution and boldness,\nrisk aversion and risk taking, fear and fearlessness. No great accomplishment\ntakes place, whether it be a movie or a deep ocean expedition or a space mission,\nwithout a kind of dynamic equipoise between the two. Luck is not a factor. Hope\nis not a strategy. Fear is not an option.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nOver the Edge of the World\nFerdinand Magellan took almost three years to circumnavigate\nthe globe.

That concept really didn't exist. He was going for\ntwo reasons, and they were pretty basic reasons. One was for greed, and one was\nfor glory.\nThere were two superpowers in those days, one of the important analogies\nto the recent present, during the Cold War. Those superpowers were Spain and\nPortugal, and they were vying for control of the ocean. They were doing that\nbecause they were vying for control of the world economy, or the global economy,\nsuch as it was. The key to that economy in those days wasn't oil, the way it is now;\nit was spices. We all say, \"What's the big deal about spices--cloves, cinnamon,\nnutmeg? Who cares? You can buy them in the supermarket. In those days, cloves\nwere the most valuable commodity on the face of the Earth. They were more\nprecious, pound for pound, than gold.\nOn his voyage, Magellan refused a number of opportunities to trade iron\nfor gold on a pound for pound basis, because he wanted to save space on his ship\nfor the cloves, which were more valuable. That one surviving small ship, less than\n90 feet in length, Victoria, that made it back to Seville laden with cloves, made\nenough money for the bankers who financed it and for King Charles, the Spanish\nbanker, to make the whole expedition--which was, in human terms, a tremendous\ndisaster--a huge commercial success. This inspired Spain to follow up five times,\neach time unsuccessfully, on Magellan's vision of circumnavigating the globe.\nFor me, researching this book, there are two approaches. One is the library.\nPeople often say, \"Well, where did you go to research this book?\" And I usually\nquickly deflate the balloon by saying, \"To the library,\" because that was the most\nimportant place. However, the library really isn't enough. You really have to get\nout into the field. It always reminds me of when I was a kid and dropping those\nlittle paper Japanese flowers into water--just add water and they come to life.\nWhen you go to the Strait of Magellan or you go to Sanlucar de Barrameda,\nthe port city in Spain from which Magellan's ships left, you begin to see the scale\nand the scope of what it was like. When you walk across a life-size replica of one\nof Magellan's ships and see how tiny it was and how primitive it was, you realize\nthat what they were taking looks to us, on a temporary risk-reward evaluation\nbasis, to be doomed to failure. But they didn't think that in those days. They\nthought that God was going to be on their side. And I'll try and explain a little\nbit to you why.\nSo for me, this was mostly tourism, to go in Magellan's tracks. Someday, to\ngo in the tracks of Neil Armstrong or Jim Lovell will be mostly tourism. Not yet.\nAnd it [would have] seemed inconceivable 500 years ago that tourists would go\nthrough the Strait of Magellan the way I did, with a couple of friends with our\ncameras, walking over glaciers that [had] imperiled Magellan's life and the lives\nof all his sailors. And the glory part of this was that they were going to bring\nChristianity and the glory of King Charles--who was all of 18 years old when\nOPENING PHOTO:\nfrom NASA's SeaWiFS satellite.\n(Source:\nSearch for 9251.)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nhe commissioned Magellan to go on this voyage--around the world and spread\nthose two goals far and wide as they went to claim the Spice Islands, which are\nin Indonesia, for Spain. Nobody really knew exactly where they were, and part\nof the expedition would be to find a shortcut, a fabled route somewhere through\nthe South American landmasses to the Spice Islands. The exact size and shape of\nSouth America was not really known. Something was known about the eastern\ncoast and that was all. They would cross what was known as the Pacific Gulf,\nconsidered to be a very small body of water.\nMy book on Magellan actually began on Mars with my previous book,\nVoyage to Mars, which was about NASA's robotic exploration of the red planet\nthrough four missions, from Pathfinder through the ill-fated Mars Polar Lander.\nDuring that time, NASA scientists at Goddard and JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory]\nkept talking about precedents for their exploration of the universe. They kept\ntalking about Columbus; we all know a lot about Columbus. They talked about\nBalboa. They talked about Vasco da Gama and they talked about Magellan. And,\nafter about the tenth or maybe the twentieth time, the name Ferdinand Magellan\nwas mentioned to me, a dim light bulb eventually illuminated in my mind, and I\nthought that might be a very interesting idea for a book. It might have a lot to say\nabout our own current age of exploration of the solar system and the universe.\nBecause after all, at the time that this man, Ferdinand Magellan, went around\nthe world, the world was as mysterious to Europeans as the solar system and the\nuniverse is to us.\nWho was Magellan? First of all, he was a misfit. If he was on this panel\ntoday, he probably would be the least popular member. He would be the one that\neverybody would be looking at and saying, \"He looks like a fanatic. He looks\nlike a weirdo.\" He wouldn't have that genial, easy-going manner and that self-\ndeprecatory humor that we admire in pilots and captains who are undertaking\nhigh-risk missions. From the little bit that we know from contemporary\nobservation, he had a knack for being abrasive and for offending people. He\ndefected from Portugal, because he couldn't get backing from the king of Portugal,\nwho personally disliked him, to Spain, where he really wasn't a known quantity.\nHe was preceded by a reputation as a daredevil, Portuguese soldier and a mariner,\nbut he was an unknown quantity. And he quickly managed, through some sleight\nof hand, to get backing from the king of Spain and his backers, who were older\nand wiser, because they were desperate to beat Portugal to the Spice Islands,\n\"\n\"\nSO FOR ME, THIS WAS MOSTLY TOURISM, TO GO IN MAGELLAN'S TRACKS. SOMEDAY, TO\nGO IN THE TRACKS OF NEIL ARMSTRONG OR JIM LOVELL WILL BE MOSTLY TOURISM.\n\"\n\"\nLAURENCE BERGREEN\nOVER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD\n\nmuch as this country was desperate to beat the Soviet Union to the Moon during\nthe height of the space race.\nMagellan was limited by his communication skills--he never learned\nSpanish well. He was very embarrassed by his heavy Portuguese accent. He\nusually communicated through very stiff documents. If he ever cracked a joke in\nhis life, there was no record of it.\nBut he was an obsessive personality and two things obsessed him. [One\nthing was] navigation, and he was a perfectionist in navigation. And as a\nPortuguese, he was aware of what was then the state-of-the-art of navigation\nand cartography in the world. Portuguese were like the Soviets in the space\nrace, obsessively secretive about their cartography. If you published a book in\nPortugal that contained any map or information about Portuguese voyages, you\nwere thrown into prison. And, of course, the book was destroyed. This was, of\ncourse, after the age of Gutenberg and [the publication of] Columbus's books had\nbeen a very important way of disseminating information. In fact, Columbus was\nMagellan's boyhood hero, and when Magellan read Columbus' account of his first\nvoyage to the new world, that inspired him to go even further than Columbus, the\nway some astronauts today are inspired by their childhood memories of watching\nJohn Glenn and other astronauts, and their exploits, on television.\nSo Magellan, putting it mildly, was not a people person, but he was a\nbrilliant navigator. He was also obsessed with one other element of his fleet\nof five ships, which were all leased and were all in bad condition: food. Most of\nthe records that we have of that time--and they are voluminous--show that he\nwas exceedingly careful about provisions and feeding the men what he thought\nwould be the most effective diet. And tremendous thought and care was given\nto the kind of food, even though it was all horrible food, it was all salty. It was\nsalt beef, it was salt cod, it was salt pork, there were olives. The only sweet thing\nwas honey, which was taken along, and there was a tremendous amount of wine,\nwhich was the staple beverage. It was mixed with water, so it probably wasn't\nvery tasty. And the other staple element was hardtack, that was basically stale\nbiscuits. It was a month old by the time it even got on the ships, and it gradually\nbecame wormy and rotten and soggy as the voyage went on. And even when it\nwas soaked with the feces and urine of the rats which infested the ships, the\nsailors continued to eat it because there was nothing else to eat beyond their\nrations, except for the leather wrapping the masts of some of the ships.\nYou may wonder why anybody would want to go on a voyage like this. In\nfact, most of the sailors came from the convict or semiconvict class and had no\nother hope for their survival in Spain but this voyage of escape from whatever\ntheir current problem was. Perhaps it was marital problems, perhaps it was debts,\nperhaps it was some crime that they had been accused of and this was their one\nescape. The officers were motivated often by greed because, after all, if they could\nbring or smuggle back some of these cloves, they would be set for life. Even a\nsack full would be enough for them to purchase a small house in the sailor's\nsuburb of Seville and live there comfortably for the rest of their lives.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nMagellan went because he believed that he was going to discover a new world.\nHe really was impelled by what we would call idealistic motives. Now, the king of\nSpain gave him tremendous latitude. He was given the ability to name continents\nand islands after himself, none of which he did; in fact, he turned out to be very\nself-effacing. The Strait of Magellan, for example, he named the Cape of the Feast\nof the 11,000 Virgins, which doesn't really roll off the tongue that well, because that\nwas the feast day on which he discovered it. So he was giving primarily religious\nnames to places he discovered because he was a very devout individual.\nHis crewmembers came from at least ten countries. They spoke at least ten\nlanguages, and they didn't get along. They consisted of a number of cabals, and\nthe Spaniards didn't talk to the Portuguese, who didn't talk to the English, who\ndidn't talk to the Germans, who didn't talk to the Norwegians, who didn't talk to\nthe Greeks. You may wonder how they communicated just to get ordinary sailing\nand nautical tasks done. They used an argot that was a Catalan slang that they all\nunderstood. But there was no easy rapport among these crewmembers, who would\njust as soon get into fights with each other as cooperate on their missions.\nI think it's fair to say that Magellan, with his lack of so-called \"people\nskills,\" faced much greater obstacles from the individuals on board the ship\nand the people he encountered in their travels around the world than he did\nfrom natural obstacles. In fact, he learned to master most of the incredibly\noverwhelming natural obstacles, including terrible storms in traversing the Strait\nof Magellan, which is a nautical nightmare. But he never really knew how to\nhandle people, except with the most brutal means imaginable, such as torture, in\norder to inspire and put dread in the men to follow him.\nThe major player at that time was King Charles the V, the king of Spain and\nthe emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. The king of Spain was a Hapsburg king;\nyou can tell that by that famous Hapsburg jaw in the portrait of him by Titian.\nAnd it was in the name of King Charles that Magellan went. Keep in mind King\nCharles was an 18-year-old boy; he was trying to grow a beard when he sent\nMagellan on this mission, and even when the survivors came back three years\nlater, he was only 21 years old and widely mistrusted by everyone around him.\nThe other major player in that era was Pope Leo X, who, as reflected in the\nportrait by Rafael, was a worried man. And if those Cardinals that are around\nhim look like they are menacing him, it's because, in those days, the Cardinals\nwere routinely plotting to kill and poison and strangle each other, and there were\nconstant plots against the life of the Pope. Nevertheless, Magellan went around\nthe world constantly pledging his loyalty and his entire expedition to the greater\nglory of the Roman Catholic Church and bringing the Church enlightenment to\npeople around the world.\nMagellan did not bring slaves or try to enslave people, which was a big\ndifference between him and his boyhood hero Columbus. He did bring one\npersonal slave with him, but when he found the so-called heathen in places, his\nfirst thought was not like Columbus's, \"Aha! There are so many people here we\ncan enslave!\" His first thought was, \"Aha! There are so many people here that we\nLAURENCE BERGREEN\nOVER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD\n\ncan baptize.\" Also, the group aboard included men, women, and children. So this\nalready marked a very important shift from the previous era of exploration.\nThe maps they used at that time were worse than useless. The so-called\n\"T&O map,\" based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, shows the ocean circling\nthe world, only three continents, Jerusalem at the top--it was absolutely useless\nfor anything. And this was the way most people--although not scholars--looked\nat the world at the time [of] Magellan['s travels]. This would be circa 1515.\nThere was a state-of-the-art map that was based on the calculations of\nPtolemy, the famous Greek-Egyptian mathematician whose mathematical\ncompilations were rediscovered and published during the Renaissance. The map\nis a projection of the world as a sphere, based on his calculations. The one dramatic\nomission is the Pacific Ocean--9,000 miles! Had Magellan known that after he\naccomplished his greatest feat of navigating the Strait of Magellan, which is at\nthe southernmost tip of South America, that he still had to cross the Pacific, he\nprobably wouldn't have gone and he probably wouldn't have gotten backing from\nthe Spanish crown or from the financiers who were expecting--like businessmen\neverywhere--a reward, a return on their investment. They were hoping for about\n14 percent, incidentally. So his maps were mostly useless. In fact, when he got\nto the Pacific Ocean, he was so exasperated with these kinds of maps and charts\nthat he threw them overboard in a temper tantrum and said, \"These maps are not\nto be trusted.\" And from then on, he relied solely on his own charts.\nA map of his actual route gives you an idea of how it looked in the\nworld as it actually was. And you can see his route as he leaves Seville and goes\nto the coast of South America following a well-worn path by that point, until he\nbegins to work his way down to near the southernmost tip, looking for the Strait\nof Magellan, which he had promised his backers and the king of Spain he'd find\nor else. And, finally, he did manage to find it. But from then on, for most of his\nroute and for most of those three years, he was sailing through waters that were\nuncharted by European cartographers and so were unknown to him.\nWe don't have an image of his actual vessel. But we know it rides very high\nin the water. It's dark brown or black because of the pitch, the tar covering the\nsides to keep it seaworthy. Depictions of ships of the time are shown surrounded\nby flying fish, which were a constant fact of life of some of the earlier parts of the\nvoyage, and by some sort of sea monsters, which were believed to exist.\nSome of the hazards that they believed to exist at that time were mermaids,\nconsidered to be a fact. Another was a magnetic island; if the ship sailed too\nclose, the island would pull all the nails out of the ship, the planks would come\napart, end of story. That was also considered to be scientific, factual. Then there\nwas the mythical continent of Terra Australis. Not until the 19th century was the\nexistence of this continent, thought to somehow counterbalance the continents\nof the Northern Hemisphere, disproved. And, also, the water was thought to boil\nat the equator, because it would be so hot.\nSo, there were all sorts of imaginary hazards that Magellan and his sailors\nthought they were facing, which turned out not to be the case. However, they\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nwere also facing real hazards that were in some ways even more dangerous. For\nexample, scurvy. Scurvy was the radiation poisoning of its era. There was no\nknown cure for scurvy. We now know that a teaspoon or less of Vitamin C taken\na day, in orange juice, or many herbs, or even beer, or malt, is the magic bullet\ncure for scurvy. But Europeans didn't know about that until 200 years after\nMagellan's voyage, which was a complicated, fascinating medical story in itself.\nAt that time, scurvy was a dread disease. It caused loosening of the teeth and\nmottled skin, and then, literally, the hard parts of your body, your bones, your\nteeth, your tendons, would come apart--your body literally falling apart. And\nover thirty sailors on Magellan's crew succumbed to the deprivations of scurvy\nand a horrible death at sea because of this disease, which we now know is so\nsimple to prevent.\nSo, danger was everywhere, and again, prayer and a belief in the divine will\nwas about the only protection that the men felt they had against it.\nOne of the great false leads of the voyage was the Rio de la Plata, South\nAmerica, which many of the men insisted was actually the Strait of Magellan. Of\ncourse, it's many hundreds of miles north. When Magellan saw it was shallow\nand covered with silt, he figured, just based on sheer instinct, that it wasn't deep\nenough to somehow cut through the South American land mass, and come out\nthe other side in the Pacific Ocean. And so he sailed around the bay, and kept\ngoing, and said, \"This is not it.\" The men didn't agree, and they mutinied, and he\nresponded to the mutiny by drawing and quartering some of the leaders, which\nFerdinand Magellan's route around the world (1519-22). ((c)1996 MAGELLAN GeographixTM)\nLAURENCE BERGREEN\nOVER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD\n\nwas a brutal procedure that involved removing their intestines while they were\nalive, burning them in front of them, and, eventually, decapitating them, putting\ntheir heads on a stake, and putting those stakes in the harbor where the ships were\nmoored in order to enforce discipline. And that was how Magellan kept his men in\nline. It was a very, very different era from today, as I was saying at the outset.\nOne of his chief discoveries, which was truly accidental, was the Magellanic\nClouds. Now, as I mentioned before, this was not a scientific mission. Not until the\nAge of Enlightenment and Captain Cook in the 18th century was the concept of a\nscience mission really popular or prevalent. Nevertheless, Magellan brought with\nhim a chronicler who had never been to sea named, Antonio Pigafetta, a funny name.\nBut Pigafetta was a rather intelligent, very ambitious young Venetian diplomat who\nheard about Magellan's voyage when he had gone to Seville, and he signed up for\nthis mission. And most of the important things we know about it comes from the\ndiary that Pigafetta kept on the voyage. He survived, and Magellan didn't.\nThese Magellanic Clouds, which were until about 10 years ago thought to be\nthe galaxies closest to the earth, were simply described by Pigafetta as two \"clouds\nof mist.\" Period. They had really very little idea of what they were looking at, but\nhe noticed everything. He also wrote down 30 different languages that Europeans\ndidn't know about, spoken by various preliterate tribes around the world, giving\nus our first lexicographies of all these languages. So he was an astronomer, an\nethnographer, and an anthropologist. He also became, because he learned these\nlanguages, translator for this mission. Pigafetta turned out to be one of Magellan's\nbest hires, let's put it that way. Especially because he survived.\nThe Strait of Magellan itself is unchanged from 500 years ago. It's basically\na fjord. The water is very cold. If any of the sailors had fallen overboard, they\nwould have survived six minutes at most. By the way, most of the sailors then\ndidn't know how to swim, and they had a terrible phobia about the water.\nFive hundred years later we walked across what our guides like to call a\n\"cold beach.\" There were Magellanic penguins, which were ubiquitous [and]\nwhich bailed Magellan's sailors out of starvation time and again when they went\nthrough 500 years ago.\nThe way Magellan managed to navigate what was really a maritime maze--\nnot a straight watery path--was to have his men climb mountains, and look ahead\nand see, well, which way to go. What was a dead end, and what was going to take\nthem to the Pacific during this 300-mile crossing? He also tasted the seawater.\nWhen it was salty, he knew he was near the Atlantic. When it got to be fresher,\nhe figured he must be getting to the middle of the strait. And when it turned salty\nagain, he figured he must be coming out to the Pacific, which was a misnomer,\nbecause the water there was even rougher than it had been in the Atlantic, where\nhe had faced some terrible storms.\nGlaciers were noted by Pigafetta, and looked at by all the men, but they\ncouldn't figure out why they were blue. Of course, they're blue for the same reason\nthat water is blue, because of the way the eye selectively absorbs scattered light.\nMagellan's fleet was very lucky not to have been crushed in one of the glaciers.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nMagellan very unwisely immersed himself in a tribal war when he reached\nthe Philippine Islands. When he reached that archipelago, he was actually\nworshipped, literally, by the islanders there, whom he converted to Christianity\nin mass baptism, including men, women, and the children. Pigafetta calculated\nseveral thousand conversions. And Magellan got so caught up in this that he\nwanted to keep on doing it. Meanwhile, all his officers who had survived to this\npoint said, basically, \"You know, we're on a commercial mission here. We have to\nget to the Spice Islands. You don't know where they are. We've got to get there.\"\nBut Magellan said he wanted to stay.\nThere was one island leader we know by the name of Lapu-Lapu, who was\nin a war with all the other islands in the Philippines. He was the ruler of the\nisland of Mactan. And he decided that since all the others were converting to\nthis new and strange deity who was brought from afar in these gigantic black\nships, he was going to do the opposite. So, he challenged Magellan to a battle.\nMagellan, as you might gather, was never one to back down from a fight. And\nhe said \"Fine, we'll undertake this battle.\" He figured he had gunpowder and\nweapons, guns on his side, which were very primitive and as likely to blow up\nas to fire correctly. But they did have crossbows, which were far more lethal, and\nthey also had armor. Magellan figured that armor would be impervious to blows\nfrom bamboo swords and that one of his soldiers would be able to defeat 50 or\neven 100 island warriors.\nSo Lapu-Lapu challenged him to a battle. Magellan decided that 60 men\nwould be enough for him to handle whatever Lapu-Lapu threw at him. He waved\noff assistance from a local sultan who offered all of his soldiers and troops to\nMagellan in favor of Magellan's support. He waved off offers of support from all\nhis men. He told his ships to stay way back--he didn't need to be covered by fire\nbecause God was going to protect him.\nSo, he undertook this amphibious landing early in the day on April 27,\n1521. His 60 men were met by 1,500 enraged soldiers with fire-hardened, poison-\ntipped swords and with bamboo shields who charged into the water and eventually\noverwhelmed Magellan, once they figured out who Magellan was--and he was\nrather conspicuous because of his plumed conquistador's helmet. (Note to other\nexplorers, don't wear a conquistador's helmet while fighting the enemy!) They\nmanaged to throw spears at the exposed parts of his body, at his arms and his\nlegs. Finally, they managed to knock his sword out of his right hand. When he\nstooped to pick it up from the water, he took another spear in his arm, disabling\nit. And then Lapu-Lapu's soldiers closed in for the kill. And, essentially, they\nhacked Magellan to pieces right there in Mactan harbor, and there was nothing\nlarge enough left for even a proper burial. And that was the death, the very, very\nunnecessary death of perhaps the greatest explorer of the entire Renaissance era.\nHis crew had seen this coming, because they had been aware of his growing\nrecklessness, and they quickly elected two captains, Portuguese and Spanish,\nto continue the expedition all the way to the Spice Islands. And then, finally,\novercoming one disaster after another, one ship made it back.\nLAURENCE BERGREEN\nOVER THE EDGE OF THE WORLD\n\nBy the way, the one ship that made it back was captained by a Basque\nmariner, Juan Sebastian Elcano. And in Spain this is known as the Elcano\nmission, rather than the Magellan mission, out of a nationalistic feeling, because\nMagellan was Portuguese and was viewed with so much suspicion by the Spanish\nauthorities.\nSo, as you can see, the idea of what exploring was like in those days was\nalmost incomprehensible compared to what we're used to today. And so our\nexploration of the solar system continues in that spirit, but with a tremendously\ndifferent approach from what it was like then.\n■\nBack to Contents page\n\nDiscussion\nDAVID LONGNECKER: My name is David Longnecker, from the University of Pennsylvania,\nand I'm addressing my question to Mike Gernhardt. I was intrigued by your calculation of\nacceptable risk for DCS (decompression sickness). As you know, the concept of acceptable\nrisk is one that's getting considerable play throughout NASA, as we look towards future\nexploration. Do you think it's possible to apply such techniques and such mathematical\napproaches to broader risk categories, as we look for broader missions?\nMICHAEL GERNHARDT: That's a great question, and the answer is: absolutely, you can.\nThere are limitations, obviously, to the data and to the statistics, and, ultimately, you will\nhave to make judgments. I found that running this process, I started out with an uninformed\ngroup and my own notions of what acceptable risk were. And we ended up with an educated\ngroup and a specific definition and a consensus to move forward. So, I think the answer to\nthat question is yes, a similar process could be run with return to flight, using models that are\nout there for [foam-shedding] and MMOD (Micrometeoroid/Orbital Debris) prospectively\ndefining what acceptable risk is for reentry. The only danger is that that should not be a\nsubstitute for good judgments. And I think if you look at that as one tool, a decision support\ntool, it could be very valuable in that regard.\nEUGENE RODDENBERRY: Hello. Eugene Roddenberry. Actually, I've got a question for Mr.\nCousteau. I wonder if you could tell us about what your son is doing today and if he's okay.\nFrom what I hear, speaking about risk, he's taking some risk right now.\nJEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU: Well, I think he's taking a very calculated risk. He, and some\nof the Hollywood people have helped him, built--that was a dream of his for a long time--a\nlife-size great white shark in which he's hiding. The structure of the great white, which can\nmove on its own, is such that anything can attack it and he's completely safe. What can go\nwrong is his life support system if he doesn't do the right thing. So, it comes back to him.\nIt's not nature that's the problem, it's human.\nHis objective is to find himself in the middle of other great white sharks, perfectly\nprotected, a lot better than I was when I was in South Africa. And he, from the inside, can\nsee through the eyes of the shark, as can the cameras which are looking out through the\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nGORDON OSINSKI:\nquit.\nj\n(NASA Image Number STS064-217-008).\neyes, at what's going on around it, and can kind of study the behavior of these\nsharks, which we know so very little about. So, from a scientific point of view,\nhopefully, they will make some new discoveries as to the behavior of great whites\nby including less risk than if we were in cages or even scuba diving. So, I don't\nthink he's taking a lot of risk, personally. Much less than other people have, and,\nhopefully, we will learn something. And that's what he's doing at the moment,\nas we speak.\nDAVID LAWRENCE: David Lawrence for Laurence Bergreen. Was going around\nthe world the great challenge in 1519 that Magellan hoped to meet, or was it just\nto get the cloves and get home, and it was just accidental that his expedition\ncontinued to make the first circumnavigation?\nLAURENCE BERGREEN: Yes, that's a good question. The latter. It was almost\nincidental. He figured that was the fastest way to get to the Spice Islands to bring\nhome the spices and to avoid the time-honored overland route, which was much\nslower, far more expensive, and controlled by the Arabs. So, it was really what he\nfelt was the expedient way to do it. The efficient way to do it.\nGordon Osinski, from the University of Arizona and\nsoon moving to the Canadian Space Agency. We've talked so much, so far,\nabout the risk of exploration, and the title of the symposium, but until this\nmorning, nothing about the risk of not exploring. I think John Chatterton said,\n\"Exploration is who we are. We should continue on the path of exploration or\n\" And Sylvia Earle said, \"Something is happening to us as a species.\" There\nare people yesterday who thought, to continue evolving as a species we should\nexplore, we have to explore.\nI was moved by the reasons why we should explore the sea, and we're looking\nto the stars. I was born a few years after man last walked on the Moon. I've been\ndoing some teaching recently and I'm shocked, aghast, at how many people think\nwe have not walked on the Moon, or actually, how many people think we have\nwalked on Mars. So my question is: Is there a greater risk of not exploring than\nexploring? And maybe pose that to the whole panel and to everyone.\nJEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU: I would just like to jump in by saying that we've\ndone a very, very poor ob of communicating the results of our exploration to the\npublic. I mean, you'd be amazed to go in parts of the country and find out that\npeople don't know anything about what's going on at NASA. And we have to see\na communication resolution, that we are leaving at the moment and taking for\ngranted. We have to find a way to get, particularly, young people to know what's\ngoing on. And by doing so, we're going to revive the excitement of exploration\nand stop, once and for all, this concept that everything has been done, and\neverything has been discovered, and there is nothing to do, and let's go and have\na drink. It's very, very sad, and I see this more and more. But there are people\nwho are starting to make a difference in that sense. So, we need to really tackle\nyoung people in schools.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nBackdropped against the blue and white\nEarth 130 nautical miles below, astronaut\nMark C.

I was so dismayed by this cover story\non a new magazine, I think it was U.S. News and World Report last spring, about\nthe great age of exploration being over. That the great frontiers were during the\ntime of Magellan and Columbus and all that. And yes, there's much to be done\nout in space, but this planet is largely explored. I actually sat in an Explorer's\nClub banquet one evening and listened to a spokesperson for space exploration\ntalk about how the only frontiers left were up in the sky, until Kathy Sullivan\nkicked the speaker from under the table, and I got up and gave him a laser look\nfrom across the room. We're talking Carl Sagan here.\nAnd he backtracked and said,\"Oh, yes, most of the ocean has yet to really be\nexplored.\" And that's the point, you know? If I were in charge, the administrator\nof an agency with the objective of looking at the solar system and surveying all\nthe planets and all the things and even beyond, I'd say, \"That blue one! That one\nthere with all the water. That's the one we really need to concentrate on because\nthat's where the action is!\" If you're looking for life, find the water. And we've\ngot it. It's here.\nAnd my greatest fear is that we, with all of our technology and knowledge\nabout how dependent we are on the natural systems that support us, we're\ngoing to let the system degrade to the point where our species is going to be in\ntrouble. We are in trouble! The thing is, we don't appreciate it. I'm all for looking\nskyward and in every direction of exploration, but it baffles me why we aren't\nreally motivated to look inwards. To look at the ocean, to explore it, and to find a\nplace for ourselves here within the natural systems that sustain us. And to apply\nthis great technology that we have to really understand the magnitude of what we\ndon't know about the ocean, and put it to work for us, for our survival, for our\nwell-being. This is the time.\nIn the next ten years, if we don't really take action, we're going to lose the\nchance with many of the species that we have taken for granted all our lives--\ntuna, swordfish, and the like. It's going to be gone! Coral reefs and all these other\nsystems that are at risk right now. We have the capacity to turn things around.\nThe real question is, are we going to use our knowledge in the spirit of exploration\nto do it? I mean, Goethe said, \"It's not enough just to know. You must act.\" Well,\nwe know. Do we have the capacity now to act?\nJOHN CHATTERTON: The spirit of exploration is certainly\nthing. But\nexploring requires resources. It requires money. And right now, we're very much\nsatisfied with spending money on weapons of war, on SUVs, on things that are\nreally counterproductive to our best interests. And, certainly, one of those things\nwould be exploration.\nJAMES CAMERON: Well, I think that's an excellent point, you know. I guess I\ntried to make it--probably crudely--that the type of exploration that remains\nto be done on our planet requires more advanced technology than previously.\nYou could do a lot and put your names in the history books with a small ship--\nwhich was state-of-the-art at the time--or some sled dogs and some true grit\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nand some luck. These days, none of those things are sufficient. You need large\norganizations like NASA or NOAA, Wood's Hole [Oceanographic Institution] or\nMBARI [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute] or some body like that to\nprovide technology and support staff and engineering and so on, so it does boil\ndown to a budget issue.\nGo back to Mike's formula, you know? Cost is a factor, the likelihood of\nsuccess is a factor. You run that equation. That applies to the financing [of] a\nmovie, the funding of a deep-ocean expedition, or an entire research program that\nmight deal with the deep. People look at it and say, \"What's the reward? What's\nin it for me?\" But there are new and interesting ways to finance explorations\nthat didn't exist before. The deep ocean is revealing such vast biodiversity that\nwhole new genomes are being revealed, and there are pharmaceutical companies\nthat are interested in bioprospecting the deep ocean, which will allow them to\ncreate new drugs, new treatments, and so on. So there's renewed interest in pure\nexploration, in a sense, and biosampling in realms that previously were being\noverlooked as not economically viable.\nSo it's just a question of being creative about how we create the funding\nparadigms. I've tried to do something a little bit unusual. In the past, filmmakers\nhave piggybacked on scientific expeditions that were going anyway for reasons\nof the goals of their various parent institutions. We flipped it around on our\nlast film and got the money from the media sources, then went to the scientific\ncommunity and said,\"Hey, we're going out with submersibles to the hydrothermal\nvents in the East Pacific Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Who wants to come\nalong and take advantage of these assets that we're marshaling out there for\nimaging purposes?\"\nAnd interestingly, our best response was from the astrobiology community.\nWe wound up taking researchers from Ames and Johnson Space Center and from\nJet Propulsion Laboratory with us out there to--not to do analogue research, but\nto look at the biology of the deep vents and relate it to what they might find in\nthe fossil record on Mars or other places in the solar system and beyond. So we\nwere actually using media and entertainment funding to help with science and\nexploration. There are different ways to skin the cat, but I think the important\nthing is for everyone collectively to try to engender the passion for exploration\nin the next generation.\nAnd part of that is reminding them of the heroes of the past and keeping\nthat image alive, and part of that is reminding them that there is so much of the\nworld and of the universe that has yet to be explored. It is within our grasp, and\nit's a real adventure that we can really have and really enjoy in our lifetimes, if we\nput our will toward doing that.\nSYLVIA EARLE: What is the cost of not exploring? That's the real factor.\nANDY PRESBY: My name is Andy Presby. I'm a student here at the school. When\na person of my meager accomplishments attempts to suggest something that may\nbe new to a group such as this, he must do so with a certain degree of humility.\n\nDISCUSSION\nI hope you will recognize the respect that I have for everyone in this room and\neveryone, particularly, at that table. I think you guys are missing the point.\nI've heard a lot of talk over the last couple of days, and I've been a space nut\nsince I was three years old and my daddy took me to see one of Mr. Roddenberry's\nmovies. However, we talk a lot about the scientific benefit. We talk a lot about the\npersonal exploratory benefit. For example, exploring Mount Everest. You then go\nand talk about the need to inspire the next generation of explorers, and I completely\nagree with you, Mr. Cameron, that that is absolutely required. You've talked about\nthe cost. We talked yesterday about a goal, and typically, when I hear somebody in\nthe space community talk about a goal, they mean a planet. They mean a body. I\ndon't think that's the goal that will inspire that [next] generation of explorers.\nWe have for the first time in human history come to recognize that, as you\nsay, Mr. Lovell, we are living on a spacecraft, a giant spacecraft that we didn't\ndesign and we don't know how it works. Now we're screwing around with the life\nsupport mechanisms. I work in submarines. I understand and fully appreciate the\nneed to keep life support gear running, but I also understand the need to explore\nthe environment around me and, perhaps, find alternative means through which\nthe needs of--what is it now?--six and a half billion people who all want the\nAmerican standard of living, which, if I am not mistaken, involves approximately\ntwo personal slaves worth of energy per year per person.\nWe live in an environment that's flooded with energy. Space is full of it.\nI hear folks talking about very narrow goals, and we're talking about scientific\ngoals. We're talking about exploratory goals and personal goals, and those are all\nimportant. Those are all immediate short-term goals, but I argue that, to inspire\nthe next generation of explorers, you need to speak about long-term goals such as\nfinding ways to relieve the pressure that we place on our environment by looking\nat, and yes, it's going to be expensive, sir, ways of moving resource production\nand other systems such as that off planet.\nI have a tremendous interest, and everyone sitting here in this row has a\ntremendous interest, in the sources of human conflict. The two sources of human\nconflict, as my friends have said, are the misunderstood \"other,\" close proximity\nto same, and lack of resources. Why don't we speak about that?\nDAVID HALPERN: Very well said by the next generation.\nJAMES CAMERON: I wholeheartedly agree that energy is probably going to be the\nsource of conflict. It is currently the source of conflict. It is going to continue to be\nthe source of conflict, and there may be energy sources revealed, whether it is mining\nhelium-3 on the Moon, doing off-planet fusion production, creating antimatter on\nthe back side of the Moon where the earth is shielded, or whatever you want to do.\nI think these are good ideas. I think that the issue of solving the problems with our\nlife support system here--which is something I personally am passionate about\nbut didn't speak about today because, frankly, I knew my colleagues here would\ndo it because I know them well--is a separate issue from exploration. I think that\nthere are aspects of exploration that are survival requirements.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nEARLE: While\nour\nno\nWhen Sylvia talks about the risk of not exploring, it's really the risk of\nnot having the technical capability to explore. We build our muscles slowly to\ngo out and do these things. We are still on an indefinite hold in low Earth orbit,\nbuilding up the muscle to learn how to support human beings for long duration\nin order to be able to go further. We are relying on our robots now to be our\nprecursors out there. We have to build up this capability, and, personally, I believe\nyou do have to have goals to do that. You have to have a focusing element. It can't\njust be an abstract thing: Let's go out and solve our energy problems out in the\nuniverse. We won't solve them at the Moon. We'll solve them here, generating\nthe technology that enables that exploration.\nIn my mind, I uncouple the abstract goal of exploration, which is to satisfy\nthe human soul--yearning, understanding, all those things--from the hard core\nnuts and bolts activity of exploration, which has always spawned so much in\nthe way of economic enhancement of this country and of the other developed\ncountries, because we put so much energy into the technology required to do\nthese difficult and exotic things. We will develop an improved nuclear power\nsystem. We will develop fusion power. We will develop some of these things, and\nthe control systems for same, in the course of trying to get to Mars or do these\nhigh energy things that we have to do in order to explore the solar system. Our\nunderstanding of distant stars from orbiting next-generation space telescopes\nand so on may be the key turning the latch of figuring out how to have an\nunlimited power supply here on Earth that will replace oil, and give us another\ndifferent excuse in the future for going to war. Right now, our excuse is oil.\nSYLVIA\nwe do look for alternatives to\ncurrent energy\nsources--and we should definitely do that--meanwhile, we can make better use\nof what we've already got: more efficient use of our current energy resources.\nIt is not just in terms of oil, gas, and things of this nature; I mean in terms of\nfood resources, too. Twenty million tons of wildlife extracted out of the ocean\nis simply thrown-away bycatch. More than 300 thousand marine mammals\nevery year are destroyed in the process of catching fish. We are seeing the fish\nthat we are taking just collapsing. You know we are too good at catching these\nthings. We are hunter-gatherers, but we're armed with new technologies that\nour predecessors could not imagine. So, we need to put on the brakes and think\nabout more effective use of the resources that are here. We couldn't support six\nbillion people with wildlife from the land. Ed Wilson, Harvard biologist, says\nwe've seen consumed \"the large, the slow and the tasty from North America over\n10 thousand years\". It's only taken us 50 years with our new technologies to do\nthe same thing with the ocean. We are very close to losing some of the creatures\nthat we have thought infinitely able to rebound\nmatter [how many] we\nextracted from the ocean. Exploration, in terms of finding solutions to the very\nproblem you have posed--how do we find the place for ourselves that is going\nto last, knowing that our numbers have increased three times in my lifetime,\nbut the planet stays the same size? Our capacity to support us is currently being\nstretched. It's not just oil and gas. It's oxygen in the atmosphere. What are we\n\nDISCUSSION\ndoing to that part of the world, the ocean, that is generating most of the oxygen,\nabsorbing much of the carbon dioxide? We're messing around with it. We need\nto know how it works. That means explore it, and then, take heed. Not just, yeah,\nwe've got all this new information, but acting on what we are learning and doing\nit in a way that secures a place for ourselves so we can continue to explore as long\nas humankind survives.\nANDY PRESBY: I don't know if anybody else wants to comment, but I didn't\nmean to focus specifically on energy. It was an example, and one that we can all\nrelate to. I don't know if that helps anybody respond to my question.\nJIM GARVIN: Jim Garvin, NASA, Moon and Mars Chief Scientist. They're our\nresources. I think the tenet I'm hearing in response to this great question is that\nwe have to separate exploration, as a catalytic tool to make things better, from the\napplied end game of exploration that we can document in history, from Magellan's\nsearch for cloves and in finding first orbit of Earth. How do we measure that? One\nof [the] things we are asked all the time is, what is the yield from these catalytic\nthings? Whether they be to inspire, what are they? We use lots of terms, and\nI think this audience would be wonderful to try come up with those metrics.\nThis young man says inspiration isn't enough. Okay. As we catalyze, what is? The\none I always find easy, maybe because I'm simpleminded and not yet quantum-\ncomputing, is IT. Information technology. Why are we doing it better in some\nplaces? Many reasons. Smart people. Maybe that's an area we ought to look at as\npart of exploration to extend ourselves to think better and to use our resources\nbetter to better inspire. Anyway, that's my comment for the group.\nJAMES CAMERON: I think there is an inspirational dividend to exploration. I\nthink this is one of the primary reasons to do it. I think you have to ask yourself,\nwhy are the Chinese doing a space program that basically mirrors what we were\ndoing thirty years ago? Why is it important to them now, as the fastest growing\neconomy on the planet, to be doing it, to simply be reproducing an accomplishment\nthat is already done? Because they know that the inspirational dividend within\ntheir own borders is going to be significant in inspiring kids to go into technical\ncareers in math, engineering, and science. So, the value that they are getting out\nof it is much greater than what they are putting into it. They've done the math.\nThey can't win that race any more.\nI think we should ask ourselves, what are we losing by not exploring, in\nterms of the inspirational dividend to a younger generation? One of the biggest\nproblems this country is going to be facing is the lack of \"fresh outs\"in engineering,\nmath, and sciences in the next ten years or so. We've got some big problems to\nsolve, and we're too far down the path as a technological species to go back to the\ngarden and try to pretend none of this ever happened. We've got to get ourselves\nout. We've got to think ourselves out of it as a technological species. We have to\ncontinue to build those tools and that capability.\nCertainly, with the vast amounts available for military procurement, you've\ngot people working in math and science and so on making pretty good livings there.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nOne\nWouldn't you rather have an alternative to that, though, in space exploration\nwhere we can focus our minds, improve our IT capability, improve our control\nover energy systems, and, by the way, understand long-term regenerative life\nsupport systems? If we're going to go to Mars, the point is to stay there, not\nsimply touch base and run back. We're going to have to learn how to live there\nwith very, very finite resources.\nThe more we learn about closed loop ecosystems, the more we need to\nknow about the big, closed loop ecosystem that we live in, and vice versa.\nbody of knowledge will feed the other. I think there is an awful lot to be gained\nsocietally for the investment that we are making in space exploration, and I would\ncertainly like to see a proportionate amount spent on ocean exploration. I know\nSylvia is enlightened in that she is one of the few people in the ocean community\nthat doesn't constantly complain about those billions that NASA gets.\nWhen they're fighting for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousand of\ndollars, she is enlightened enough to know that all knowledge improves us all and\nthat exploration should be constantly going in both directions. I agree with that\nas well. I could talk for hours about the value of analogues, of ocean exploration,\nof space exploration . . . And how you could build muscle in both places . . .\nJOHN CHATTERTON: The other thing is that exploration should not just inspire\nmore exploration. Exploration should inspire additional exploration, but it should\ninspire us to think big, to work on problems like energy, to work on problems like\nthe environment, to work on problems like population. Everything that we've got\non our to do list as a species, we need to apply ourselves, if we're going to find\nsolutions. We don't really have that much in the way of a choice.\nJIM PAWELCZYK: My name is Jim Pawelczyk and I'm at Penn State University.\nJames Cameron, you mentioned in your talk that we've already picked the low-\nhanging fruit with regard to exploration. All of you have spoken about inspiring\nthe next generation of explorers. Do we need a different educational paradigm in\norder to make those things mesh? And if so, what do you think it looks like?\nSYLVIA EARLE: I have three children and four grandsons. It disturbs me that\nwe aren't getting this generation coming along--the kids--actually out doing\nthings in good, wild places. In fact, our safety mechanisms in schools dictate\nagainst it. You go to Hawaii, kids aren't allowed to go get in the water as a part\nof their school activity--not above their ankles, anyway--because, you know,\nit's not safe. So whatever it takes, whether it's museums, aquariums, moms and\ndads, whoever, we need to take the responsibility for getting kids connected with\nthe real world, the living world, the wild world. We're missing it in the rather\nstructured form of education as it is currently being conducted, not just in this\ncountry, but most of the rest of the world where education systems are--really, I\nmean, it's important to learn the ABCs and the 1-2-3s, but we've also got to learn\nthat we're a part of this greater system, and that's missing.\n\nDISCUSSION\nPAUL SPUDIS: Yes, Paul Spudis, Applied Physics Lab. I want to thank Andy for\nstimulating a really good conversation here, because I think he's nibbling around\nthe edges of something. I've been listening to this for the last couple of days and\nI've heard a lot of interesting things. But I have two comments. First, in regard\nto this argument of spending money on weapons versus exploration, they're\nactually complimentary and, in fact, historically, the exploration is something\nwe let the military do during peacetime. And all the great explorations of the\nPacific weren't undertaken because they were interested in the natural history of\nPolynesia, they actually wanted good maps that they could use to retain British\ncontrol of the seaways.\nThe second point I want to make is that I think that we've nibbled around the\nedges of the issue of why we do exploration. And I think there's three motivations\nto it, of which we've only discussed two. The first motivation was discussed\nyesterday, and that's sort of the personal gratification. You know, because it's\nthere, I want to go, I'm curious, I want to know. The second motivation is societal\nand collective. It's, we explore to get strategic information, to inform ourselves\nso that we can make better guesses on how to do something else, whether it's to\nidentify other resources or to develop a technology or something like that. But\nno one's talked about the third motivation. And that is exploration as a prelude\nto settlement. We explore because we want to go live there. And one of the really\ninteresting things that we got out of Apollo is an appreciation for the fact that,\nsooner or later, life on this planet is doomed. We know this because we know\nthat impacts occur, and we know that in the past they've come darned close\nto nearly completely sterilizing the Earth--wiping out almost 95 percent of all\nliving species. So, ultimately, someday, somehow, that's going to happen here.\nAnd one of the big motivations, I think, for exploring space, is to create\nadditional reservoirs of human culture, so that if Earth is destroyed, or the\nbiosphere is destroyed, there will be, the human race will survive. Now, that's\na long-term thing, certainly isn't a part of going to the Moon or going to Mars.\nBut doing that by going to these places, we're going to learn the skills we need to\ndevelop the ability to live off-planet. Does anyone have any comment on that?\nPENNY BOSTON: Penny Boston, from New Mexico Tech. I've been thinking\nabout another type of risk that we really haven't addressed yesterday and today.\nAnd it's really a risk to exploration. When I look at everybody here who's doing\nexploration, we're all relying more and more on ever greater degrees of technology.\nSo that the point at which one can participate in this, the number of people\nbecomes narrower and narrower. You have to be well-educated and you have to\nhave access to resources. And I think back to the famous essay by C.P. Snow, in\nthe middle of the last century, the two cultures where you see this increasing\ndichotomy between those who know and those who have, and those who do not\nknow and do not have. And it seems that, unless we attend to that growing bridge\nin society, that ultimately threatens our future in terms of exploration. I see\nsymptoms of that in these sort of vacuous reality shows that are on TV. As much\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nas we may denigrate them [the reality TV shows], what it seems to me to indicate\nis that the vast majority of people are feeling more and more uncomfortable with\ntheir excessively cloistered and safe lives, and that, perhaps, this need to acquire\nrisk is general throughout the population, even though people like us manifest\nit maybe more obviously. And so, this potential danger to all of our enterprise,\nwhether it be ocean or land or space, seems to me a festering element that we\nneed to address.\nJAMES CAMERON: I think that's an excellent point. And my answer would relate\nto the previous question about education. You suggested that the problem is that\nthe technology narrows the band of people that can actually participate. But,\nin fact, technology can also be an enabler for people everywhere to participate,\nthrough improvements in information technology. And, you know, theoretically,\nwe're all wired up to one big human nervous system. So, if we have an avatar,\nwhether it's robotic or human, out there somewhere at the bottom of the ocean or\nin space doing something that's interesting, there's no reason why we can't all look\nover its shoulder and participate. But it requires a will on the part of the people\nbudgeting that operation to make sure that they put in as a line item, not just\noutreach in the sense of, \"We're going to tell people what we're doing and show\nthem some images,\" but participatory outreach in the sense that, \"We're going to\nlet you look over their shoulders. We're going to spend that extra two or three\npercent on a major mission to let people actually participate.\" And I know that the\nrecent activities on Mars have done an absolutely stellar job in doing that, if it can\nbe judged by the number of hits to the NASA Web site--I think it's up to 11 billion\nnow or something like that. People are looking over the shoulder of those little\nrovers. And if we had human beings there right now doing microbiology--I know\nthat's your field--or whatever, if we should get so lucky as to find some evidence\nof that on Mars, people would be able to participate in that. So I think the solution\nis always going to be there as a technical solution. It's a question of imagining it\nbefore the fact and incorporating it into what we're doing.\nSYLVIA EARLE: Just endorsing your observation about the need to have risk. It's\na kind of spice. Probably more valuable than cloves.\nDAVID HALPERN: With that parting comment, I think it seems appropriate to\nbring this session to an end. I'd like to thank Administrator Sean O'Keefe and\nAmes Director Scott Hubbard for the wonderful facilities that we're in now. And\nI especially want to thank each of the panelists for their dedication and their\nwonderful comments and their inspiration for what we've been doing. And I'd\nlike to thank, finally, the audience for the wonderful questions and wonderful\nattentiveness. And with that, I have one more thing. Those of you who are from\nthe East Coast probably have never lived through an earthquake, but you just had\na 5.9 earthquake about 120 miles off the coast. So this here session is memorable\nin many ways. Thank you again.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nOpen next section\n\nS E S S I O N T H R E E\nstars\n\nIntroduction\nIn this symposium, we've heard from women and men exploring the earth, the seas, and\nthe limits of human capability. We've discussed personal risk, programmatic risk, technical\nrisk, survival of the species risk, and the most important of all, the risk of not exploring\nat all. We are compelled by some ancient instinct to push the limits, to go where humans\ncan't survive except for brief periods of time or with significant technical support.\nMy name is John Grunsfeld. I'm the chief scientist of NASA. I'm an astronaut; I've\nhad the privilege to fly four times in space. I've done five space walks, so in fact--along\nthe lines of going to places where people can't survive--I do, in fact, work in a vacuum,\nalong with many of the others in this room. And it's truly a privilege to have been able to\nbe involved at the infancy of space exploration. In this session, we do turn to that ultimate\nchallenge, our first steps off the home planet. We live in a truly remarkable time.\nAs we speak here, as we're comfortably sitting in this environment, Gennady\nPadalka, the commander on the International Space Station, and Mike Fincke, the chief\nscience officer, are spending their 163rd day in space. (I may be off by a day.) For over three\nyears, we've had 24/7-365 occupation of the International Space Station. The ultimate\nservice, if you will. And I think that's pretty remarkable.\nSpirit and opportunity are still alive on Mars; we'll hear more about that. Cassini\nis at Saturn taking unbelievable images, things that we've never seen before, things\nthat we certainly don't understand. We have the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer\nTelescope, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory astronomy facility--three of the four\ngreat observatories, all exploring space and discovering things that we couldn't even\nimagine when these instruments were conceived.\nWe now know that there are over a 100 planets around nearby stars, when a decade\nago, we only knew about our own solar system. And, in spite of this tremendous growth\nof our knowledge of our home planet, the solar system, and the universe, it turns out\nfrom recent observations that we only know a tiny bit about what makes up our universe.\nNinety-six percent of the universe is filled with stuff and we don't have a clue what it is.\nBut I have to say, we're a little bit arrogant. Because when I was a graduate student\nand a postdoc and a faculty member at Caltech, it was believed that we knew about most\nof the universe, the history of the universe, the Big Bang and inflation and expansion of\nthe universe. And I thought that most of the great frontiers in physics had been solved and\nwe were cleaning up the details. And, as you heard this morning on the sea, we talk about\nhaving explored to the ends of the Earth, but 96 percent is still unexplored. For most of the\nuniverse, we still don't have a clue what makes it tick. We are really in the infancy in space\nexploration. Only 12 people have walked on the Moon, our closest planetary surface, and it's\ntime to leave the cradle.\nIn all the preceding talks, the central theme has been risk--that's what we're here\nto talk about. One element that has been discussed, peripherally or centrally, is what I\nconsider to be one of the central issues, which is teamwork. Space exploration sets a new\nextreme as a team activity. I think we can draw a parallel to Jim Lovell on Apollo 13, the\n\nultimate team of folks 200,000 miles from planet Earth with a pretty terrible problem.\nAnd Mike Foale, as he described last night, on the Mir space station, an international\nteam also with really tough times. And how the team in space and on planet Earth came\ntogether to solve those problems that led to the ultimate success of those missions, the\nsafe return of the crew.\nFor this session, we've assembled a team to continue this great discussion on\nrisk. And I dare say we have, indeed, put together a team of stars.\nJohn Grunsfeld, NASA Chief Scientist and Astronaut\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nRisk and Reward in Apollo\nOne of the things that occurred to me that might be worth\nemphasizing, relative to other discussions that have already occurred, is a brief summary of\nthe reward that came with whatever risk that was run--personal as well as national--with\nrespect to the Apollo program. Certainly it was conceived in the context of the Cold War,\nand it succeeded spectacularly. And even some of the emigres that I've had an opportunity to\ntalk with say that it had a tremendous influence on the confidence of the Soviet leadership\nrelative to President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, in that they believed--maybe\nmore so than many of the people in this country--that we would succeed, because we\nsucceeded in Apollo where they had not.\nSecondly, the technology base that Apollo enhanced--I think you're hard put to\nfind any specific item that it created, but it certainly enhanced the technology base. That\ntechnology base is available to us still today and has accelerated human progress in so many\ndifferent ways and in so many different fields.\nThe cultural and societal legacy is often, I think, forgotten. It was a tremendous\nconfidence-builder among the American people at the time. And, really, as we traveled the\ni\ni\nHarrison \"Jack\" Schmitt is a geologist, astronaut, and U.S. senator. He received a bachelor of science\ndegree in science from the California Institute of Technology in 1957 and a doctorate of philosophy\nin geology from Harvard University in 1964. He was a member of the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 and,\nthereby, the first and only geologist to land on the Moon. Schmitt served from 1977 to 1983 as a United\nStates Senator (Republican) representing New Mexico. Harrison is a founder and chairman of Interlune-\nIntermars Initiative, Inc., an organization that advocates the private sector's role in lunar exploration and\ndeveloping lunar resources.

Now, whether we've lived up to the legacy\nof that confidence or not is another discussion, but nevertheless, these kinds of\nprojects do have that kind of effect, in that, if we can go to the Moon, then we\nsurely can do some other things. And the answer is that you can if you motivate\nyoung men and women to believe it's the most important thing they're going to\ndo with their lives. If you can create that kind of motivation, indeed, you can do\njust about anything.\nAnd, finally, from my perspective of actually having been on the Apollo 17\nmission, the scientific legacy is just unfathomable. It is absolutely a magnificent\nlegacy of Apollo and its precursors that they created our modern understanding\nof the origin and evolution of the Moon, a foundation that's been built upon by\nsome of you with the Clementine and Lunar Prospector missions. It's something\nthat now relates directly to further understanding of the terrestrial planets, not\nthe least of which are the Earth and Mars. Imagine, once in a while, what it would\nbe if we did not have that legacy of information about the Moon--what kind\nof thoughts you would be having on Mars based on the information currently\ncoming in? So this, in a very brief way, I think\nillustrates why the reward was so fantastically\nimportant and so much worth the risk that a\nfew people, and the Nation and managers and\nfamilies, took in pursuit of that goal.\nWhat I would like to spend a little\nmore time on today is thinking about the\nprobability of success, which is the inverse\nhandmaiden, if you will, as a measure of\nrisk. A few years ago, in a paper that I'm sure\nnobody saw that I gave at one of the space\nconferences in Albuquerque, I tried to deal\nwith the evaluation, in a semiquantitative way,\nof the various approaches that one might take\nto return to deep space, and, specifically, to the\nMoon. As you might expect from my biases, the\nprivate sector approach won in that evaluation,\nbut it was on the assumption that there are\ncommercially viable lunar resources--namely,\nas was mentioned by James Cameron and\nstimulated by the young man here to my right,\nthe possibility of lunar helium-3 fusion power\nas one of several potential sources of electrical\npower that we're going to need over the next\n50 years and beyond. If you want the latest lay analysis of what the envelope of\nfinancial and technical success is for a lunar helium-3 initiative, I will recommend\nto you the October [2004] Popular Mechanics.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAstronaut Eugene A.

It is clearly the challenge of this\ngeneration and subsequent generations as well. My own estimate is that in order\nto just provide four-fifths of the world's population with the level of standard of\nliving that we enjoy today, we're looking at 10 to 11 times the amount of energy\nby 2050 that we consume today per capita. I'm not going to go into that any more\ndeeply, but if someone is interested, I'm sure I could find the paper that would\ngo into it more deeply.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, risk is always with us, as has been made very\nclear by this outstanding symposium. And there are always going to be people\naround us, many of them in this room, that are willing to take the risks, whatever\nthey might be, because we can conceive of the rewards. We're human beings, and\none of the great advantages we have as a species is we conceive of these kinds of\nthings. In major technological-based endeavors, I have come to the conclusion,\nstudying this over the last 20 or 30 years to some degree, that there really are\nthree dominant, interrelated determinants for success.\nWe were talking about the probability of success here, which is the inverse\nof risk. One is the size of the management reserve funding; second is the\nmanagement experience and flexibility to carry out this great project; and third\nis a cadre, a reservoir, of motivated young men and women.\nNow, first let me address the size of the management reserve of funding.\nIn Apollo, you all know the story--true or not, but it certainly worked out that\nway--of Jim Webb getting an estimate of what it was going to take to accomplish\nApollo and then doubling it and doubling it again, and that was our management\nreserve. And we used all of it. We didn't go over it, but we used all of it. And the\nreason a management reserve [is] so important is [that] it enables management,\nthen, to deal with the unknown unknowns and with erroneous initial assumptions\nthat might have been made about the approach to the problem.\nApollo is a good example of where an adequate management reserve brought\nsuccess. The Shuttle is an example, particularly in the early days, of where an\ninadequate management reserve caused significant problems. I happened to be\nin the Senate when Shuttle was headed for its first flight, and in 1978 it was\nclear that Shuttle was not going to get to first flight without a major influx of\nfunds. The Carter administration, at the time, was not willing to fight for that\n\" \"\n. . . OUR EXPERIENCE WITH APOLLO AND SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITIES INDICATE\nTHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE MOTIVATING OBJECTIVES THAT ARE ABOUT 10 YEARS\nAPART, PLUS OR MINUS A COUPLE OF YEARS.\n\" \"\nHARRISON SCHMITT\nRISK AND REWARD IN APOLLO\n\nsupplemental budget. I think it was the fiscal '79 budget, if I remember correctly,\nthat needed the supplemental. Until a good friend of ours named Hans Mark\nwas able to push and persuade President Carter that the Shuttle was required for\nverification of the SALT II treaty, which Carter was very interested in, we were\nnot going to get that supplemental.\nBut, fortunately, Hans did persuade the President to do that and we suddenly\nhad the White House helping us get the supplemental through a Democratic\nCongress. I might say that Hans had set that one up a little bit, because the payloads\nhad been designed for the Shuttle and not for ELV [Expendable Launch Vehicle],\nso he had a pretty good argument. That does present, though, an ethical dilemma,\nand I don't have an answer for this dilemma. It depends on what you believe the\nultimate value and reward of the project in hand will be, in that, if you, in a legitimate\nanalysis, know that you have inadequate funding and continue with inadequate\nmanagement reserve to take on a new project, should you take it on? Maybe the\nPostgraduate school here could have a seminar or something on that subject and\ntry to come up with an answer, but I really don't have it. Because I think you can\nargue that the managers of NASA at the time felt that even if they realized they had\nan inadequate management reserve of funding, that if they didn't go ahead with\nthe Space Shuttle under the constraints that the Nixon administration established,\nthat we would not have a manned space flight program. So I'll leave that dilemma\nwith you, and maybe you can debate it over the next beer.\nNow the second thing, the management experience and flexibility, was\ncertainly epitomized by the NASA management team in place between 1967 and,\nin particular, in 1968-72, when it really did crystallize and became a team that\nis to be envied, I think, by all of us. And it was critical to have that kind of team,\nbased initially from the heritage of the NACA, the National Advisory Committee\non Aeronautics, and added to by people like Sam Phillips and Bob Seamans and\nothers, who came in and provided that really remarkable team that led us through\nto success, not only for the first landing, but, also, the success for Apollo as a\nwhole. And, indeed, that team of managers, in particular Bob Gilruth, George Low,\nand Sam Phillips, made decisions well prior to Apollo 11 in order to optimize the\nApollo system so that it could be used for scientific exploration of the Moon.\nAll you'd have to do is look at the decisions that were made. The lunar rover, the\nBlock II Lunar Module, the advanced ALSEP [Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments\nPackage] and, strangely enough, the agreement that we should begin to fully train\nthe Apollo crew, beginning with Jim Lovell's crew, in exploration geology. And the\ncombination of all of that meant that we got that legacy I mentioned earlier of a\nremarkable scientific return from Apollo.\nThe third and maybe most important determinant for success is to have\nthat reservoir of young men and women available to apply their stamina and their\nimagination to the project at hand. Jim Lovell did not mention it yesterday, but Gene\nKranz, after the Apollo 13 crisis had been resolved, did an analysis of the average\nage of people in the Mission Control Center and it was 26 years old. And most of\nthem had already been there for several years. And there was just no question that\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nyou've got to have that kind of stamina, that kind of imagination and flexibility and\nwillingness to work as teams, or you probably are not going to be successful.\nNow, having said that, I also feel that our experience with Apollo and\nsubsequent activities indicate that you need to have motivating objectives that\nare about 10 years apart, plus or minus a couple of years. But that's about what I\nthink human evolution has given us in terms of our ability to concentrate for 16-\nhour days, 8-day weeks for a long period of time in order to make sure that which\nis to be done happens. So, as we look to establishing a long-term capability for\nindefinite exploration of our solar system and, eventually beyond, I think we have\nto still think in terms of how we quantize that period into specific objectives\nthat each generation can identify with and accomplish. Now, with respect to\npublic support and political support, I don't think there's any question that we\nin the United States believe and will continue to believe--and certainly NASA\nbelieves--that visibility and transparency are absolutely essential.\nIf you're going to have active and sustained political and explanatory\nsupport for efforts like we are about, you also need to have a White House\ndeeply committed and involved at basically all levels. There is no substitute in\nthe Congress for an active interest and activity from the White House. Whether\nit's a Democratic or Republican-controlled Congress, you still have to have that.\nOtherwise, you just don't get their attention very well.\nNow, on the private sector side of things, you need to have investor\nsupport. And to have investor support, the most important thing, of course, is to\nhave competitive returns on investment. That is, competitive with other uses of\ncapital. If you can do that, if you can show a path for that return on investment\nin a relatively short period of time, you have a predictable path for success. In\nfact, it's more predictable than the government, and that's why we're going to\nconcentrate on that right now. I know what the criteria for success are in a private\ninitiative. I know what they are in a government initiative. But the ones in the\nprivate sector are much more predictable. Or you just need to have an angel out\nthere with irrational exuberance. And we're hoping to find one of those one of\nthese days, and we'll be on our way.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nHARRISON SCHMITT\nRISK AND REWARD IN APOLLO\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nMir Adventures\nJohn asked me to be on the panel and talk a little bit about\npersonal risk. How do you decide, from a very personal standpoint, what risks you're willing\nto take? Specifically, to talk about the thoughts that went through my head, when I agreed to\nbe a crew member on Mir, in connection with personal risk. It's a fact that a person is born\nand from the time you are born, you are taking risks. Every single person, every day of their\nlife, is taking risks in one form or the other, and, as you go through life, you are learning\nto mitigate the risk. What risks you are willing to accept, what risks you are not willing to\naccept in such and such a case. Well, I'm not going to go back to the day I was born to talk\nabout how I think I learned to accept risk, but I will go back to 1962 when I was 20 years\nold. I just had graduated from college, I was 20 years old, I had a passion to fly, and I had no\njob. As you can see, that didn't correlate very well, but I knew that what I wanted more than\nanything in the world was an airplane that I could fly.\nSo my father asked me what I was planning on doing, and I said I was going to buy an\nairplane. And he looked at me and he said, \"You've never even bought a car yet! How do you\neven know how to buy an airplane?\" And I said, \"Father, don't you worry! It's airplanes we're\nMir\nid\nShannon Lucid was born in Shanghai, China, but considers Bethany, Oklahoma, to be her hometown.\nShe graduated from Bethany High School in 1960, received a bachelor of science degree in chemistry\nfrom the University of Oklahoma in 1963, and a master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees\nin biochemistry from the university in 1970 and 1973, respectively. Shannon Lucid was selected as\nan astronaut in 1978, after spending time as a teacher and researcher. She has flown as a mission\nspecialist in the Space Shuttle on five missions, deploying satellites, conducting scientific observations\nand experiments, some in a special laboratory built into the orbiter's cargo bay, and spending 188 days\nworking on board the Russian Space Station,\n. From February 2002 through September 2003, Lucid\nserved as NASA's chief scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC. Lucid remains an active\nastronaut at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\nShannon Luc\nNASA Astronaut\n\nj\non Mir\nMir\nMir.\n\"\nthe Space Shuttle Atlantis\nMir,\nthe Russian space station.\n(NASA Image # S79-E-5388)\ntalking about. Aviation.\" And I said, \"Everybody in aviation is absolutely honest,\nso don't you worry. Nobody will sell me a bad airplane!\"\nSo I didn't have to worry about how to go about buying an airplane or\nwhat to look for, et cetera. Well, I went out searching, and I found an airplane.\nNot a pretty airplane, but it was the only thing that I could get in the panhandle\nof Oklahoma, and, trust me, this is really true, it was sold to me by an aviation\nsalesman with a glass eye. And he told me it was absolutely perfect and he would\nshow me the logbook he had. It just had a brand new fabric ob and so on. I\nbought the airplane, and the next month the airworthiness certificate was taken\naway from it, so I was grounded. I thought my life was over.\nBut life went on. And I did get a very, very valuable lesson. And the lesson\nI learned was that when you are involved in an activity, just because someone is\ninvolved in the same activity and maybe they're using the same words, it doesn't\nnecessarily mean they have the same value system. And when you are working\nwith a team, in the activities that you're in, it's very important to know that the\npeople that you're investing with have the same value system, and that when\nyou're talking about something, you're talking about the same thing.\nThe other lesson that I learned over the next few years, before I came to\nwork at NASA, was I flew that airplane and I flew other airplanes for several\nthousand hours. I flew from Alaska down to Central America, and there were\nalways concerns about whether or not you're going to have an accident. If you\nread aviation reports, it seems that most of the accidents were due, in one way or\nthe other, to pilot error. And the biggest concern that I had was, okay, it's okay if\nyou crash, but I didn't want it to ever be pilot error.\nSo I didn't want the obituaries to read, \"Shannon was so stupid. Can you\nbelieve that she took off in that thunderstorm?\" And, so, that sort of tempered\nthe decisions that I made. And they are all hard decisions that you make while\nyou're flying. Mainly, the hardest decision is not to fly. And I found that I had\na very difficult time doing that, to say no, when I really wanted to go. But, like I\nsaid, over the years I learned how to do that.\nSo I went to work for NASA. And I was very fortunate in working for NASA,\nbecause with the Shuttle flights that I was fortunate to fly on, I found that there\nwas a team that had the same values system. And one of the great benefits of\nflying and working for NASA was working with the people in Mission Control,\nworking with the people at the Cape, because we were all part of a team, we were\nall working together for the same objective.\nSo, then the day came when I was asked if I would like to be a crew member\n. And, of course, I would have said, you didn't need to ask because I've\nbeen volunteering for years. But I said yes, and then a friend of mine went up to\nbefore I did, on a flight to bring Norm Thagard back. And my friend had not\nbeen back on earth more than two hours when the phone rang, and my friend said,\n\"Shannon, don't go.\" And I said, \"Oh? Don't go where?\" She said, \"To\n\" And I\nsaid, \"But why?\" And she said, \"Because you will be living in a mine shaft for several\nmonths, and I just can't picture you living there. So, take my advice, and don't go.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAstronaut Shannon W. Lucid onboard\nas she returns\nhome from her six-month mission on\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nI CHANGED IT INTO WHAT I CO\nLE.\nLE.\n\"\n. . . THE WAY I NEGATED THAT RISK WAS, I CHANGED THE PURPOSE OF\nTHE FLIGHT IN MY HEAD . . . I TOOK WHAT WAS A PERCEIVED RISK AND\nI CHANGED IT INTO WHAT I COULD\nD HAND\"\nU\nAnd so that was one input. Another input was, we trained in Star City in\nRussia, and the week before I was to go back to the United States for three weeks\nbefore I got on the Shuttle to go up to Mir, I was leaving a movie theater in Moscow\nwhich doubled as a church on Sunday morning. As I was leaving there, a lady came\nup to me who I didn't know, and she said, \"Are you the American woman that is\ngoing to go up on that tin can?\" And I said, \"What?\" And she said, \"I saw on the\nnews. Are you really going to go up and be locked up in a tin can for months with\ntwo Russians?\" And I thought, well, now, that's a novel way of looking at it. It\nwasn't quite the way I had been looking at it, and [it] made me think why did I\nreally want to do this, because I really wanted to do it in the worst way.\nAnd there were several reasons. One reason was, because I had had several\nShuttle flights, and I enjoyed them very much. I really enjoyed flying in space.\nAnd if you have a small piece of cake, a big one would be even better. So I figured\nthat, since I had enjoyed the short Shuttle flights I had been on, I would really\nenjoy a longer duration space flight.\nAnd the other reason why I really wanted to go was because I was curious. I\nwas very curious to find out what it would be like to live and work in space for a\nlong period of time. I was curious to see how the body would adapt. And I really\nwanted to experience that.\nAnd the other reason was, as a child I'd always wanted to be part of an\nexpedition. I mean, I read all the books about expeditions and going off and\nexploring the different places on the Earth. And, in my mind, going for a period of\ntime on a long duration spaceflight on the space station would be the equivalent\nof going on an expedition. Because I had written to National Geographic, I\nhad written to everyone I could think of, to find out how you could get on an\nexpedition. And it turns out that, basically, you had to know somebody who had\nsome money. And since I didn't know anyone, that option was closed. But this\nwas a chance that I had to experience that. So, those were the reasons why I was\nso anxious and so eager to go and fly on the space station Mir.\nNow, while I was on Mir, there were other risk factors that came in. One\nof them came when I was talking to my daughter on the ham radio one day.\nAnything that I found out of any importance about the program always came\nto me via friends or family members or the ham radio or whatever. And then we\nheard from the program. And my daughter said, \"Hey, Mom, guess what? You're\n\"\nD\"\nDLE.\"\nDLE.\nSHANNON LUCID\nMIR ADVENTURES\n\nnot going to come home when you think you are. You're going to be stuck up\nthere for months.\" And I said, \"What? What are you talking about?\" My daughter\nworked for a contractor that worked for NASA, so she was tied into the chain of\ngossip. And she said, \"They're having some kind of a problem, so don't pack your\nbags yet, because you're not coming home.\"\nAnd the first time, as soon as I heard that, I thought, oh my goodness. Because\nI remembered back to meetings that we had had at JSC [Johnson Space Center], and\nwe had had them for years before, talking about space station. They were the life\nscience meetings about how you should plan a mission. And the gist of it was that\nyou could only go in small increments. We had been in Skylab 90 days, 100 days,\nbut we had to be very careful. We couldn't exceed that. We had to have something\nlike 10 to 20 missions before we could go beyond 90 days. And then we were going\nto go up to 100 days, and then we were going to go up more. One of these very small\nincrements, getting up to where we could spend a longer period of time.\nSo my first thought when my daughter told me that was [of] those\nmeetings. And I thought, oh my goodness, in one fell swoop we're going way\nbeyond anything they discussed in those meetings. My second thought was, get\nreal, Shannon, let's use a little common sense here. Because there in Star City\nyou've seen all these people walking around that have been in space for a lot\nlonger than you're going to be up there. And there is nothing wrong with them.\nAnd, so, common sense negated\nwhat might have been thought of as\na perceived risk at that time.\nNow, another risk that I felt\nbefore I launched was that I wasn't\nreally sure what I was going to be doing\nwhen I got up on Mir. And I say that\nbecause we had the U.S. experiments\nthat were coming up, the science. But\nwe didn't know when it was going to\nbe there, because it was delayed. And\nno one was just real sure when it was\ngoing to get there.\nAnd the other thing [perceived\nrisk] was due to the complexity of\nthe program. I had never been able\nto go through the experiment that\nI was going to be doing end to end.\nSo, thinking about it just before we\nlaunched, I thought, you know, I could be really being set up here, because if you\ngo and you weren't able to do the experiments, you look, professionally, sort of\nbad because you weren't able to get your work done.\nBut, then, the way I negated that risk was, I changed the purpose of the flight\nin my head. I was not going up to do the science. I mean, that would have been nice,\nBackdropped against the waters of Cook Strait near New Zealand's South Island, Russia's Mir\nSpace Station is seen from the aft flight deck window of the Space Shuttle Atlantis.\n(NASA Image # STS76-713-036)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nbut that wasn't my personal primary purpose. I thought, the reason I'm going to go,\nand the reason I'm doing this flight, is because I want to see what it's like to have a\nlong duration flight, and I want to make sure that my crew mates and I get along and\nthat we have a great flight. And I thought, that I can handle. That's not dependent\non any payload coming up, or it's not depending on having any procedures.\nSo I took what was a perceived risk and I changed it into what I could\nhandle. Now the next risk that I thought of was, well, people always ask, \"Were\nyou comfortable living up there on Mir? How did you sleep?\" And the reason\nwhy I was comfortable living on Mir and went to sleep every night without\nany problem was because Soyuz was always attached. It gave you a great deal of\ncomfort in your heart knowing that if a problem arose, if there was a fire, a rapid\ndepressurization or anything, you had a way home. You had a lifeboat. You could\nget in the Soyuz and go home. And that you had an automatic abort mode and\nthat gave you a tremendous feeling of comfort.\nNow, there was one other risk that arose, and that was, once we got in orbit,\nit turns out--and I didn't know this ahead of time--the Russian cosmonauts\nwere going to do EVAs [Extravehicular Activity]. I thought, that's fine, they're\ngoing to go out and do EVAs, and I'm going to sit and watch them.\nWell, about a couple of hours before they went out to do their EVAs, and\nactually, they were already in their EVA underwear, the commander called me\nover and said, \"Shannon, quick, come here, I've got to train you, because this is\nwhat you're going to do while we're out\". And I said, \"What? I am going to be\ndoing something?\" And then he started rattling off in Russian these long lists of\ncommands that I'm supposed to be putting into the solar panels to get them to\nmove so the station will work properly. So, I'm losing my mind, so I say, \"Whoa,\nwhoa, wait, wait, wait a minute! You can't have me doing this, because I haven't\nbeen trained and I don't know how to do this\". And he said, \"Oh it's easy.\" And\nthen he was rattling it off again. Then I said \"Look, it may be easy for you, but\nI'm just an older American woman. So I need a little bit of help.\" And I said \"I\nneed a procedure\". And he said, \"Procedure? We don't have any procedures.\" And\nthat was true, they didn't work off procedures very much. And I said, \"I repeat,\nI'm an American. We work off procedures. I have to have a procedure.\" And then,\nbecause it was close to the EVA, he was getting a little tense, he sort of gave up.\nBut then the engineer said, \"Okay, I'll help you.\" So we sat there and we wrote out\na list of the commands and procedures that I was to follow. And then we wrote\nout how I was supposed to know when it was time for me to do this.\nAnd I mention this because I did feel under a little bit of pressure, because\nI wanted to do the right thing. And I knew I was under pressure because I had a\nlot of sweat on the back of my neck about that time. But I took the perceived risk,\nor took what I felt was a risk, and changed it into something I thought I could\nhandle. I changed it into a procedure. I forced the system into accommodating\nwhat I could handle. And so that's how I handled those risks.\nSo, from a personal standpoint, that's how I looked at Mir and handled the\nrisks that I saw. Then the big question that people always ask is, \"Well, okay,\nSHANNON LUCID\nMIR ADVENTURES\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nwhy do you want to fly in space? You have these risks, so why do you want to fly\nin space?\" I know exactly why I want to fly in space. It's sort of hard to put into\nwords. That's why I put this picture up there, because instead of a metaphor, it's\nsort of like a \"picturephor,\" except it doesn't really say it all. It's a sunset. And you\nsay, \"Okay, you want to fly in space because you want to see a sunset?\" Yeah. It's\nbecause you can look at the world in a new and a different way. You grow, and it's\na huge challenge. And one of the aspects that I really enjoyed about spaceflight is\nbecause you're working with a team, you're working with a marvelous team.\nNow, being actually in space, being the person that actually goes to fly,\nyou're the person that people see, and sort of the tip of the iceberg that sticks up.\nBut it's this huge team effort that does it, and being part of a team, it enlarges\nyourself, so that you're bigger than yourself. And it's all of that put together that\nis the reason why I want to fly in space.\nAnd a further reason is sort of the same reason why I really enjoyed working\nin a lab, back in the days when I used to be a scientist. You'd work in the lab and\nyou'd work all hours, and then, finally, one day it would happen where you had an\nidea; you had done the experiment, and then you looked at the data, you saw the\ndata, and you thought, wow! This is something new. You had found a new way\nof looking at the universe. Then you write your paper, and no one else thinks it's\nas marvelous as you thought. But, still, you had the feeling that you were able to\nfind something new that hadn't been seen before. You'd seen the world in a new\nway, and it's sort of the same way when you can express in words in such a way\nthat someone else can understand what you're saying, because you put the word\ncombination in a certain way so that you'd gotten the message across.\nAnd that is all part of the same reason of why you want to go into space,\nand why you want to explore. It's because you are part of something that's bigger\nthan yourself, and you can get a feel for what it's like to be really creative, and\nreally see the world and experience the world in a new and marvelous way.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nMars Exploration\nI'd like to share with you a very personal set of connected anecdotes to\ntalk about the risk of exploration, in particular of Mars. We all explore in different ways and\nsometimes we don't know that we're exploring. I think in spirit we explore. In the 1960s,\nI didn't know the risks I was taking as black disks were hurled at me at 100 miles an hour,\nand as, in the cacophony of the hockey game, I weighed those risks. And as a young child,\nI experienced those as well. But I think the message in all of exploration is learning, as one\nexplores, to accommodate the risks, to recognize them, and to react. And, of course, being a\nhockey goaltender was good training for learning the heartbreaks of exploring Mars.\nSo, I'd like to try to take you forward a number of years, and the exact date we can't\nsay. But the time when people and machines, women and men and machines, are able to\nexplore Mars. And, in this case, I think the question is really not one of ifs, but really one of\nwhen the time is right, when those benefits can be matched against the exploration risks. So\nI'm going to take you through some history to try to talk about that.\nI think we all learn to explore in different ways. Shannon gave us a wonderful story\nof exploring in space. My beginnings in this regard came trying to look for Mars on Earth\nin\ni\ni\ni\nJames B. Garv\nNASA Ch ef Sc ent st for Mars and the Moon\nIn his position (since 2000) as chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program and the newly initiated\nlunar exploration initiative, James Garvin is responsible for formulation of scientific requirements for the\nexploration of Mars and the Moon and overall leadership of the scientific trajectory of the programs. He\nbegan his NASA career in 1984 in the Geodynamics Branch of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,\nGreenbelt, Maryland. He has served as chief scientist for the Shuttle Laser Altimeter experiment (SLA),\nwhich flew in Earth orbit twice, and as principal investigator on 12 airborne laser altimeter missions\nto such remote locales as Iceland and the Azores. He is a co-investigator on the Mars Orbital Laser\nAltimeter (MOLA) on board NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and the NEAR Shoemaker laser\nrangefinder experiment. He has published over 60 peer-reviewed research articles and thousands of\nextended abstracts. Most recently (January 2004), he appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman\nas NASA's Mars expert.\n\nthrough the eyes of the Viking mission that I was lucky enough to be an intern for.\nAnd in doing so, I recognized that there are a lot of difficult-to-measure things\nthat, in fact, pose risks to the science and understanding we're trying to build.\nEarth as a training ground was one of the ways in my educational experience that\nI tried to accommodate risk. But I realized in doing so that there were things I\ncouldn't measure. I didn't have the technology or the tools. Just as many of the\nexplorers taught, I needed more tools to get more data. One way to obtain these\ndata is to benefit from human spaceflight to make robotic measurements.\nI realized that the landscapes that we want to understand on Mars and on\nEarth needed to be measured with new scales, robotic scales rather than human.\nI was fortunate to benefit from human spaceflight carrying my experiment, the\nShuttle Laser Altimeter (SLA), for the first time in the mid-1990s, to measure\npart of the Earth. This gave me the benefit of human exploration, the Shuttle\nprogram, carrying a robotic instrument. The first landfall that instrument made,\nso to speak, was, rather ironically the path right over Mauna Kea, the truly largest\nmountain on planet Earth considering the depths from which it rises from the\nocean floor. We were rather shocked, in fact, to realize that our flight path allowed\nus to measure this 4,000-meter place that I had visited as a graduate student\nsome ten years before to learn how to measure Mars.\nNow, in viewing human spaceflight to enable robotic experimentation,\nthe same sort of reducing risk routine is important. The advantage of human\nspaceflight was that it was more akin to flying an aircraft experiment than many\nof us in the remote sensory arena are experienced with. We had people on site\nto fix the problems. On our particular flight, in one case, the switch that enabled\nthe high-energy laser to make the measurements was, in fact, wired incorrectly.\nHuman error, part of risk. So we had to command our crews, in this case, to flip\nthe switch off to turn the laser on, and we had a very simple procedure, one step.\nWe were extremely good at it and had we not had that capability, we would not\nhave been able to fly the experiment.\nNow, what did we learn? Well, we learned, as we did on Mars, that one\nof the big side benefits of exploration in the face of risks is the serendipity of\ndiscovery from making new measurements. Yes, we measured the shape of the\nEarth at scales of a few feet from the Shuttle orbit. We told the Shuttle command\nwe were actually giving them orbits within a few feet during flight, which was\nquite compelling to them. But, we also managed to measure the heights of the\nvegetation, part of the dynamic carbon cycle of Earth. We had the capability to\nmake measurements of Earth, which we're now making from the ISAT satellite\nas part of the Earth Observing System, that would help tell us about the carbon\ncycle on our own planet as we got ready to carry this kind of instrument to Mars\nto help prepare for landings of vehicles like the rovers.\nSo, my dream, as I became an explorer off the planet, was to map Mars\nin 3-D at the scales that humans and others would want to build. The science,\nof course, was to understand the history of the crust from the evolution of the\nplanet, but also to bring Mars into closer focus, to allow us to make some of the\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAn artist's vision of future exploration\nmissions: Two kilometers above the lava\nflows of Mars's Tharsis Bulge region, a\ngeologist collects samples from the\neastern cliff at the base of Olympus Mons,\nthe solar system's largest known shield\nvolcano.

TODAY\nOUR ROVERS HAVE DRIVEN SPECTACULAR DISTANCES ON MARS AGAINST\nALL ODDS. AND YET, IN 20 HOURS WE DROVE MANY TIMES FURTHER WITH A\nHUMAN SYSTEM. THOSE CHOICES ARE VERY IMPORTANT.\nviews that allow us to imagine going to places that are very complicated and\nunique. Without the topographic perspective, learning how to fly into that kind of\nenvironment, with robots and then with humans, would have been impossible.\nWe've learned from the legacy of our forerunners, as we always do in\nexploration. I think it's important to go back to the Moon, as we are. But it's also\nimportant to go back in history to the Moon. Because the Surveyor Program, one\nof those antecedents built into Apollo, told us many things about the planet, and\nit was originally conceived as a risk mitigation step, not as a science mission. In\nthe case of Surveyor, they were able to get to new places.\nSurveyor 7 took the only picture from the rim of a gigantic fresh crater\non the Moon--Tycho. It gave us a new vantage point on the Moon. It helped us\nlook to places we might like to send human beings and understand that great\nworld. These robotic forerunners were the steps that allowed us to get the first\nsuccessful landings on another world, in this case, on Mars.\nViking collected 10,000 images from the surface, hundreds of spectra, 14\nexperiments of the most grandiose nature in the 1970s. Viking's first pictures\nwere not beautiful vistas and landscapes; they were pictures of the feet of the\nvehicle. They were taken as part of a science contingency plan, the same kind of\nplan that we, in fact, asked Steve Squyres to implement in sending out his prize\nrover, Spirit, to Mars. And these pictures actually gave us science, the first views\nof the sort of fingernail scale or hand scale of Mars. And they showed the fact\nthat Mars dust was kicked up and ended about an hour after landing. So this was\nscience. Viking took science to new extremes in searching for the first chemical\nantecedents of life and doing other experiments. It also took great pictures. And\nexploration is about mapping ourselves into a new vantage point.\nNow, some of these pictures were high risk. I remember vividly Jim Martin,\nthe project manager, saying, \"You're not taking any sunrise pictures. It's too cold.\nYou're not going to do that.\" Well, we did. Scientists prevailed against all odds.\nWe took that sunrise picture in an attempt to make Mars look the way our eyes\nwould see it. Now, this was very controversial, but it's the way science works. We\nwere trying to understand the Mars that we would see if we were there. That's\npart of exploration.\n\" \"\nT\"\nWILL \"\nWILL\nJAMES B. GARVIN\nMARS EXPLORATION\n\nT AND RETURNED WITH SAMPLES.\nD FOR MARS.\nTHE L\nLAN\nMAY\nMars has not always been easy. I could go on and on and talk about the\ngraveyard of vehicles on Mars, from our great colleagues in the Soviet Union\nand our own Mars Observer, the great reconnaissance that we hung our program\non in the 1980s. The failed Mars Polar Lander, a wonderful mission. The Beagle,\nthat had the hopes of many to get to Mars. But out of these failures have come\nlessons--lessons that are the tough lessons of exploration; in this case, with\nrobots before the people.\nOne of the lessons is that the polar regions on Mars are important. So we've\nselected a mission called Phoenix, after a year and a half long Olympic-class\ncompetition, to go back to recover that science. Likewise, our Mars Global Surveyor,\nfrom the ashes of the Mars Observer, has been monitoring Mars and mapping it,\nenabling landings of vehicles like our rovers. It's important to look at the legacy.\nWe built the system for Global Surveyor to operate for one Mars year. That would\nhave been about 9,000 orbits. Today we are over 26,000 orbits. So we were able to\nmitigate the risk and continue the exploration--just as the rovers are.\nSo, I think it's important to understand that we mitigate risks by\ntrying new vantage points, to know better, to be more informed. Today, we're\nbuilding, constructing, innovating, and testing, at Lockheed Martin, the Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter--the ultimate reconnaissance step that will help pave\nthe way for [the] future of Mars exploration. This is a complicated system; it's\nthe largest reconnaissance orbiter to go to Mars in our history. We launch it next\nsummer. It's the team of people that will help us mitigate those risks.\nNow, for a minute, I would like to get off Mars. And, yeah, I may be a\nMartian here, but I think it's important to look at how exploration evolves. As\nwe thought about the planet Venus in the late seventies, we had a vision for a\ncomplicated mission to map the planet and its atmosphere. Fifteen years later,\nthat mission is realized in a different way. Thanks to technology, computer\nscience, and information technology, the Magellan mission gave us higher\nresolution than we had imagined in the '70s, done in a different way. It allowed\nus to couple what we were seeing from the surface of this hellish world where\nour Soviet colleagues had landed 12 times [1969-81], to the big picture. This is\nsort of inverse exploration.\nNow, the approach taken by our Soviet colleagues for their brief foray to\nthe surface of the planet Venus, 450 degrees centigrade, was to use an approach\n\" \"\nADDER TO THE MOON WAS BUILT. WE WENT MULTIPLE TIMES,\nDING\nG SIX\nX TIMES. .

Overdesign the system to\nmitigate the risks of the unknown there. Surprisingly, they have not been back\nsince their tremendous successes, which culminated with the Vega landings in\n1986. But Venus still offers us a lesson in exploration.\nI think the lessons from Mars are several. One is from our own proving\nground here on Earth. Here and now, NASA is investing in programs to use Earth\nanalogies, chemical process, laboratory scale analogies, to do science. Likewise\nwith the Moon. The legacy of Harrison Schmitt and Jim Lovell and all those guys\nthat went to the Moon and got those data, is that it is important to move ahead\nwith the Moon as we start to learn about Mars.\nNow, I thought it would be instructive to talk for a minute about the\ndifferences between the cooperative robotic and human exploration. It's\nimportant to remind you of a few facts. Facts are always good when we look at\nrisk. One fact is what we did with the Apollo missions, which I would maintain\nwere at least science enabling, however you choose to look at that. What we did\nwas, we were able to interrogate the surface of another planet, even on foot with\nminimal tools, in an extremely short period of time. In two days, eight hours of\nbeing out on the lunar environment, we traveled two and a half kilometers. That's\na human scale of interrogation of another planet. We touched and collected 50\npounds of rocks on the Apollo 12 mission to the Surveyor site. On Apollo 17, we\nupped the ante. In 20 hours of EVA we drove 36 kilometers.\nToday, the pace of exploration is different. It's not different in its yield;\nit's different in its pace. The question of the timing is one of the important\nones as we look at when will the time be right. Will\nthe risks be accommodated to send human beings?\nToday our rovers have driven spectacular distances\non Mars against all odds. And yet, in 20 hours we\ndrove many times further with a human system.\nThose choices are very important.\nToday on Mars we've experienced many\nthings. We've looked at small craters in new ways,\nwith robotic assets. We've driven in and are living\ninside one and yet, we hunger for more. Some craters\nat the scale of large football fields on Mars actually\npresent tremendous exploration risk challenges. So\nbig that during the Apollo era, the flight rules did\nnot allow the crew to venture into the fresh impact\ncraters of the Moon. Yet today, we have roving capabilities on Mars that could\nenable that. So it's that cooperative robotic and human exploration that's so\nimportant. In my own case, I think visiting impact sites has helped train me\nintellectually to understand some of those on Mars.\nSo, as we look at places to go, as we focus our attention on where the\npeople and the machines need to go on Mars, we also need to learn from our\nexperiences. One of the lessons of exploration is the risk of not exploring. Here\nArtist's drawing of astronauts setting up weather instruments\non Mars. (Courtesy of John Frassanito and Associates)\nJAMES B. GARVIN\nMARS EXPLORATION\n\n. . . IT'\non planet Earth we have a template for understanding the record of cosmic\ncollisions, but the Moon and Mars offer a better template. It's the template of\nour history, and yet the opportunities for learning come both here and there.\nThis is one of the learning factors in exploration. The risk of getting there--the\ntrip, going to the places where the action is--can be mitigated by learning about\nplaces on Earth that can train us. Training is important. We've heard that again\nand again. Training with robots here on Earth, people, and then both on Mars.\nFinally, I want to relate a story that I think is part of what makes science\nand exploration exciting. Some of the things we are going for, whether they be\nsupernovae or understanding Mars or aspects of our Earth, are ephemeral. They will\nbe gone. The atmosphere of Pluto is an example we talk about often in science.\nI have been fortunate enough to visit a small volcanic island named Surtsey,\nborn 40 years ago. It is already 25 percent gone. It may not survive this coming\ncentury, and, yet, it is a little microcosm of how the Earth responds to all the\ndynamic forces that shape landscapes on Earth. But it's a training ground, too.\nOn this little island operates one of the types of processes that may make the\nubiquitous gullies and hillsides on Mars, and we can go visit the island in the\nsame chemical environment as those rocks on Mars. The time-lapse photography\nhas been sped up. Instead of at Mars scale, this is at Earth scale. We can go visit,\nand, in a period of years, we can watch it evolve, measure [it], and understand\nhow to explore it. We can also learn from new vantage points.\nAt NASA, it's important to empower the community to competitively seek\nways to see Mars in new ways. This last couple of years we had a competition\nfor the first Mars scout. One of the missions proposed by Joel Levine and his\nteam was to look at Mars from air, to get around more, to do the recon closer to\nthe ground of the Martian system, including the trace gases, that would help us\nbe better informed. Being better informed thanks to reconnaissance has always\nmade a difference in exploration.\nSo I think there is a set of converging pathways. The timing of the\nconvergence will tell us when the risk can be accommodated to put people on\nsite on Mars for the good of science. There are many pieces, and you can see\nthem. We're doing some of them now: reconnaissance, sample selection with\nour rovers, understanding the things we see on Earth. Just this summer, I should\nsay austral summer, a field team collected a new Martian meteorite in the middle\nof the range of Antarctica: a piece of Mars sent by Mother Nature to inform us \"\nS REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOT WAIT TO WONDER. THAT'S WHAT EXPLORATION\nIS ABOUT. DON'T WAIT, BECAUSE IT'S IN THE GOING THAT YOU HAVE TO GO.\"\n\"\n\"\n'S\"\n. . . IT\"\n. . . IT\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nabout what we need to learn about. This collective approach is a way to reduce\nrisk, and, by having a program that does so, we can learn. Where are we going with\nhumans? Well, I hope it's exploring at least, in part, in the name of science.\nI will finish with two minor quick thoughts. One is that sometimes\nexploring is better captured in the eyes of the artists. Georgia O'Keefe, at the\ndawn of the space age, painted a great picture, The Ladder to the Moon, from her\nvantage point in New Mexico. I think it was Taos. It was kind of an interesting\nflight approach to getting to the Moon that only a modernist could do. But, I\nthink it is the epitome of the inspiration that allowed us to actually achieve that\nvision. The ladder to the Moon was built. We went multiple times, landing six\ntimes. The Soviets went and returned with samples. Maybe that same ladder is\nneeded for Mars.\nSo, as we have all said during this conference, it's inspiring and, in fact,\nmore than inspiring, catalyzing the youth to tell us how to go that's important. I\nthink perhaps all the vision we talk about is a powerful risk mitigation tool.\nI will leave you with one last thought as best I can. I was giving a\ncommencement address to Thomas Jefferson High School in Virginia this last\nJune. The students were really empowered. They wanted to do space exploration.\nThey cheered when they saw a NASA person show up. I was stunned. I thought\nthere was a rock star somewhere, and I couldn't imagine they were cheering for\nNASA. I thought, Wow! Here are five hundred of our best and brightest boys and\ngirls wanting to do this. I stared at them, and, rarely for me, I was brought to a\nlack of words. I stopped a moment, then said, \"You know, it's really important to\nnot wait to wonder. That's what exploration is about. Don't wait, because it's in\nthe going that you have to go.\" So we mitigate the risks by going and not waiting\nintelligently, and that's what we're doing now in our Mars program.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nJAMES B. GARVIN\nMARS EXPLORATION\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nMars Exploration Rovers\nI'm here today to talk about the Mars Exploration Rover\n(MER) mission, the mission of Spirit and Opportunity, and the risks that we took with\nthat mission. I think by any standard, MER has to be looked at as one of the riskiest and\none of the most complex robotic missions that NASA has ever undertaken, but it has been\nsuccessful. We talked yesterday about mountaineering. Well, Spirit is now the first Martian\nrobotic mountaineer, ascending the Columbia Hills. We talked this morning about oceans,\nand Opportunity is now exploring the remains of an ancient salty sea on Mars. Penny,\nI'm sorry, we haven't found any caves yet. Caves are kind of scary places if you're a solar-\npowered rover. So, we're probably going to stay away from those.\nI'm going to talk about the risks that we took to make that success happen. There\nis one point I have to make from the very outset. It is so obvious that I almost don't need\nto say it, but it's also so fundamental that I have to say it. That is, there is a very, very\nfundamental difference between our mission and most new missions we are talking about\nhere. When our rockets lifted off from Cape Canaveral last summer, our lives were not on\nthe line. Now, there were a few meetings at NASA Headquarters where I wasn't quite so sure\nll\ni\ni\ni\nifi\ni\ni\nl\ni\nl\ni\ni\ni\nthe NASA Advisory Council.\nSteve Squyres\nProfessor of Astronomy, Corne\nUn vers ty and\nSc ent\nc Pr nc pa Invest gator for the Mars Exp orat on Rover M ss on\nSteve Squyres is the scientific principal investigator for NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project. He\nreceived his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1981 and spent five years working for NASA at their Ames\nResearch Center before returning to Cornell, where he is now a professor of astronomy. Scientific\nresearch for which he is best known includes study of water on Mars and of a possible ocean on Jupiter's\nmoon Europa. He has participated in many missions of planetary exploration, including the Voyager\nmission to Jupiter and Saturn, the Magellan mission to Venus, the Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, and\nMRO missions to Mars, the NEAR mission to the asteroid Eros, and the Cassini mission to Saturn.\nSquyres has served as the Chairman of NASA's Space Science Advisory Committee and as a member of\n\nabout that, preceding launch! I almost feel like I don't belong up here with people\nlike Shannon and with [Harrison] Jack Schmitt, but I think that our experiences\ndo have much to say about how one takes risks in spaceflight, including human\nspaceflight. There were many aspects of our mission that are in common with\nwhat goes on in human spaceflight. We had a very challenging schedule. We had\na very daunting technical task. We had an enormously large and complicated\nteam to pull it all off. Addressing and aggressively mitigating the risks that come\nwith all of those things is something on which we spent an enormous amount of\ntime, and I think some of our lessons there do carry over to the very demanding\nrealm of human spaceflight.\nAs Jim alluded to, our mission arose out of catastrophe. In 1998, NASA\nlaunched two missions to Mars. The Mars Polar Lander began its entry and\ndescent sequence and was never heard from again. The most likely cause was\ndetermined to have been a single line of code that was missing that resulted,\nultimately, probably, in the vehicle shutting off its motors about 40 meters above\nthe ground and hitting the surface at about 50 miles per hour. Then, in reverse,\nthe Mars Climate Orbiter was lost when a mix-up over English and metric units\nresulted in flying the spacecraft into the atmosphere and burning it up.\nSo, we were put in a position, which we all embraced from the start, of\nbeing involved in a mission that had to succeed. The credibility of a substantial\nportion of the Nation's space program and some of the institutions involved was\nvery much riding on our success or on our failure. We had to come up with ways\nto address that risk that were commensurate with the expectations that had been\nforced upon us by circumstances.\nAs with any program, we addressed, and had to face, a wide variety of\ndifferent kinds of risks. There was cost risk. There was programmatic risk.\nThere were technology risks and environmental risks. There were operational\nand scheduling risks. I am going to address each of these briefly in turn. There\nwere many things we did individually to mitigate each of those risks, but I\nthink, almost above all, there was one thing we did from the start that addressed\nevery single one of those risks. I alluded to this briefly in some remarks that I\nOPENING PHOTO:\nNASA dedicates Mars landmarks\nto Columbia crew.\n(NASA Image # PIA05200)\nThis stunning image features the heat shield impact site of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity.\n(Source: http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07327.)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nSO, W\nmade yesterday. We knew what we were trying to do. We had a set of level-one\nrequirements. They were negotiated with NASA Headquarters. They fit on a\nsingle piece of paper--two sides. They stated succinctly and clearly what the\nMER mission was expected to do. From the day that NASA said \"go\" to the day\nthat we had a date on Pad 17A at Cape Canaveral was 34 months. We would not\nhave made it had we not all had a clear, unambiguous, common understanding\nof what it was we were trying to accomplish. Those level-one requirements were\nour guide star.\nI lost a lot of sleep wondering whether or not we were going to make it, but\nI never once questioned what it was we were trying to accomplish. We never had\nan ounce of uncertainty in our minds. That was tremendously enabling, because\nevery time we faced a decision we turned to those requirements Do we do this\ntest? Do we not? Do we include this component? Do we not? Does it help us\nmeet the level-one requirements? If so, yes. If no, it's expendable. And it was that\nsimple. I don't care how big or how small the organization, how complex or how\nsimple your task, I cannot overstate the importance of clear, unambiguous goal\nsetting. It gives a crystalline clarity of purpose to your organization from top to\nbottom if everybody knows, with no ambiguity, what you are trying to achieve.\nThat was fundamental to our success.\nI am going to go through those risks that I listed.\nCost risks: When you get right down to it, our fundamental approach\nto cost risk was that, when we needed more money, NASA gave it to us. We\noriginally costed the mission out at $688 million. We overran that by more than\n100 million bucks. The reasons for those overruns are interesting, and I will be\nglad to tell any of you about them. They fundamentally had to do with some\nin-going assumptions that turned out to be flawed. Twice over the course of\nthe development, Firouz Naderi, the program manager at JPL [Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory], and Pete Theisinger, our very able project manager, and I had to get\non a plane and go back east and tell them we needed 50 million dollars more.\nThe first time we did it, we were flogged. We then got our 50 million, and we\npromised never to come back again.\nHow long was it, Jim? About six months later, we were on your doorstep\nagain. We were really flogged on that one. When it came right down to it, with\nso much on the line and so much at stake, the Agency was able to look at their\npriorities and say, \"We have to make this work.\" Never once over the entire\ncourse of the MER development did we not do something important, something\n\"\nE WERE PUT IN A POSITION, WHICH WE ALL EMBRACED FROM\nTHE START, OF BEING INVOLVED IN A MISSION THAT HAD TO SUCCEED.\n\"\n\"\nWE\"\nSO, W\"\nSO, W\nSTEVE SQUYRES\nMARS EXPLORATION ROVERS\n\nj\nthat was enabling of meeting our level-one requirements, because we didn't\nhave the money. It never happened, and that was because the Agency made the\ncommitment to make sure it never happened.\nProgrammatic risk: Programmatic risk means a lot of different things to\na lot of people. I will define it rather narrowly to mean the way in which you\ninteract with other programs over issues like personnel, facilities, and so forth.\nOur approach there, to be honest, was very much like our approach to cost risk.\nWhat we needed, we got. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is an immensely talented,\nimmensely capable organization, but their resources are not infinite. Whenever it\ncame down to something critical--if we needed the right people, we got them. If\nwe needed certain facilities, we got them. There just weren't any questions asked.\nThe team that was put together under Pete's leadership at JPL was the best\nthat the Jet Propulsion Laboratory had to offer. Lab management always gave us\neverything that we needed. You can't do that for every project, obviously, but it\nis a matter of having your priorities straight. Your priorities were that MER had\nwhat MER needed, and what MER needed, MER got. There was a phrase around\nJPL that I heard about. Somebody would say, \"I got MER'd\". That meant that their\nfacility or their engineer or somebody had been stolen away by MER to go off and\nmake sure we got to Mars okay.\nTechnology risk: Our approach to technology risk is, basically, don't take\nany. Our mission was assembled almost entirely from existing, tested, proven\ntechnology. Air bags have been used on Mars, parachutes have been used on Mars,\naerogel had been used on Mars. The payload was ready to go. The entire mission\nwas put together from existing, qualified, capable hardware. Our computer was a\nsmoking hot machine in 1985, okay, but it was good enough to meet the ob that\nwas laid out in the level-one requirements, and so that was what we used. You\ncan sometimes accomplish extraordinarily innovative things by taking all the\nexisting technologies and combining them together in novel ways. And I think\nthere may be a lesson there; I don't think MER is the only opportunity out there\nfor taking existing, proven, safe technologies and combining them together in\nways that haven't quite been attempted before.\nEnvironmental risks: This is a big one. There were many environments over\nthe course of our flight over which we had little or no control and for which we\nhad to do our best to prepare ourselves. Launch was an environment that was, as\na spacecraft team, outside of our control. That was risky. Landing was certainly\nrisky. Unless you have a fully deterministic landing system when you land on\nMars, I don't care how much testing you do--you cannot build a perfectly safe\nMars lander. You can build the best system you can, but you can always have one\nsharp pointy rock or one gust of wind that does you in, if you got unlucky that\nday at the landing site.\nAnd so our approach to environmental risk was absolutely the best one that\nyou can take: we built two of everything. Two rockets, two landers, two rovers,\ntwo payloads, identical up and down the line, but we built two of everything. This\nis a risk mitigation technique that does not carry over, obviously, into the realm\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nof human spaceflight--you can't say, well, let's send two crews and maybe one\nof them will survive.\nBut if you have a robotic mission that must succeed, if you don't send two,\nyou're crazy, in my personal opinion. It worked very well for us. And I'll also\npoint out that it worked very well for the people who were involved in Mariner\n3 and 4--Mariner 4 being the first successful Mars flyby, Mariner 3 going in the\ndrink. The same is true for Mariner 8 and 9--the first successful Mars orbiter,\nwhen Mariner 8 went in the drink.\nThere's another aspect of environmental risk, which I think was not\nadequately appreciated by most people, and that had to do with risk to the\nscience. We were going into a fundamentally unknown scientific environment.\nWe did the best we could to select good landing sites, but we didn't really know\nwhat to expect. And one of my greatest fears when we actually first proposed\nMER to NASA as a single rover mission was that we would choose badly, that\nMars would fake us out, and we'd get down on the surface and the science that\nwe were seeking just simply wouldn't be there. If you had two rovers, and if you\nhad a very diverse planet, as Mars is, you could send them to two very different\nsites, and maybe one of them is going to turn out to be the miracle site.\nMars did fake us out, by the way. If you had told me ahead of time, \"Steve,\none of the rovers is going to land on volcanic rocks and one's going to land on\nsedimentary rocks,\" and you'd said, \" Gusev, Meridani\" I would have said, \"Yeah,\nsure. It's got to be volcanic rocks at Meridani and sedimentary rock at Gusev.\"\nIt was the other way around. Mars completely faked us out. And the beauty\nof having that redundancy to mitigate that science risk is that if it really pays\noff and both vehicles get on the surface, you take advantage of that diversity\nto essentially double your science return, because you're in two completely\ndifferent environments.\nOperational risk: The chance that, when you try to do it, it's not going to\nwork. There's no magic formula here, this one's really straightforward. You do it\nwith margin and testing. Now, it's just down to block and tackling on this one.\nYou build a lot of margin into your design and then you test and you test and you\ntest and you test. And like I always say, you test it like you're going to fly it, and\nyou fly it just the way you tested it. And we did a hell of a lot of testing on MER.\nOur schedule was all about testing. Everything that we did was about testing.\nAnd in the end, those operational risks that we personally took paid off,\nand the margin in particular was very important. We put a lot of margin in the\ndesign--there's margin tucked away in so many nooks and crannies in that design\nyou can't believe it. And it was that margin that made us comfortable signing up\nto a set of level-one requirements that says this vehicle will last for 90 Martian\ndays on the surface. But if you've got that much margin in your pocket and a few\nthings break your way, you might still be driving around on SOL 265, which is, I\nthink, what today is. So margin pays off in big ways.\nFinally, schedule risk: This was the worst risk that we faced, by far. In a\nvery real sense, the entire story of the development of the Mars Exploration\nSTEVE SQUYRES\nMARS EXPLORATION ROVERS\n\nRover program--the development of Spirit and Opportunity--is the story of an\nextraordinary group of people facing schedule risk. Like I said, NASA said, \"Go,\nand you've got to be there on the pad in 34 months.\" That was not enough time.\nIt was not enough time. There were many things that we did to mitigate schedule\nrisk--I cannot discuss them all. I will only mention two of them.\nOne of them--this will sound paradoxical, but it is not, and if you take\nanything away from what I have to say today, please get this point. Our schedule\nrisk was mitigated to a great extent by the fact that we were flying two vehicles.\nThat doesn't sound like it makes sense. It should be easier to build one than to\nbuild two. Well, under certain circumstances, if you're starved for people, starved\nfor facilities, starved for money, then, yeah, that's true. But if you've got the\npeople, if you've got the facilities, and you've got the money, then it helps to\nbe hardware rich. You have more pieces on your chessboard and it puts you in a\nstronger position. Just as one trivially simple example, there are many tests that\nyou run on vehicles like this that only have to be run on one of your two vehicles.\nAnd if you've got the facilities and you've got the people, you run those two\ntests--not in series, but in parallel, and you take up schedule. And we did that\nagain and again and again and again.\nAnd Matt Wallace, who was the manager of our ATLO--assembly test and\nlaunch operations--was a master. He was a hero of this mission and he played\nthat game with those chess pieces with such intricacy and such skill that we\nmade it, and I don't think we would have made it to the pad if he'd had only one\nvehicle. I think we had to do it with two.\nThe other way in which, I am somewhat ashamed to say, that we mitigated\nschedule risks is that we pushed an extraordinary group of people too hard. We\npushed them beyond reasonable limits. It damaged people's health. It damaged\npeople's relationships with their loved ones. We got away with it because we had\nan extraordinary group of people under an extraordinary group of circumstances,\nbut that is not a sustainable approach to Mars exploration. You cannot go back to\nthat well again and again. I do not believe that 34, 36, 38 months is enough time\nto do a robotic mission of that kind of complexity. I think you need 48, and I hope\nthat lesson is one that is taken away from the MER mission.\nI'd like to finish this on a slightly lighter note by telling you a story. We had\na lot of discussion yesterday about humans versus robots. And as the robot guy\nhere, I want to tell a story about the experience that I had that really taught me a\nlot about that particular topic. We were at first trying to figure out how to use a\nset of rovers on Mars to really do scientific exploration. The technology folks at\nJPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] built a wonderful little vehicle called FIDO. And\nFIDO was a great test rover--you could take it out in the field and you didn't\nworry about getting a few scratches in the paint.\nWe took it out to a place called Silver Lake in the Mojave Desert about\n1997. And we went out there and it was the first time I had ever been out in the\nfield. So I went out there with my team--a bunch of really high-priced geologic\ntalent--some serious field geologists. And we got the rover out there and, of\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\n. . . WH\ncourse, the rover breaks down. First time I've ever been out in the field, it's dusty,\nit's dirty, you know, the rover's not working. So okay, what am I going to do with\nall these bored geologists I've got on my hands? So I said, \"Look, let's go on a\ngeology walk. Let's go on a little field trip.\" So everybody got their boots and their\nrock hammers and their hand lenses and everything. And I picked up a notebook\nand a stopwatch. And we walked out to a nearby ridge where I knew there was\nsome interesting geology exposed and we sat down--or rather I sat down--and\nthey went off and they started geologizing.\nAnd I started timing them. You know, how long does it take for Andy Knoll\nto walk over to that rock? How long does it take Ray Albertson to pick that thing\nup and break it open with his rock hammer and look at it with a hand lens? And\nthey were doing a lot of things that our rovers couldn't do, but I focused on\nthe things they were doing that our rovers could do. And, you know, I did it as\nquantitatively as I could--this was hardly a controlled experiment. And when I\nlooked at the numbers afterwards, what I found was that what our magnificent\nrobotic vehicles can do in an entire day on Mars, these guys could do in about\n30-45 seconds.\nWe are very far away from being able to build robots--I'm not going to\nsee it in my lifetime--that have anything like the capabilities that humans will\nhave to explore, let alone to inspire. And when I hear people point to Spirit and\nOpportunity and say that these are examples of why we don't need to send\nhumans to Mars, I get very upset. Because that's not even the right discussion to\nbe having. We must send humans to Mars. We can't do it soon enough for me.\nYou know, I'm a robot guy. I mean, I love Spirit and Opportunity--and I use a\nword like \"love\" very advisedly when talking about a hunk of metal.\nBut I love those machines. I miss them. I do. But they will never, ever have\nthe capabilities that humans will have and I sure hope you send people soon.\n■ \"\nEN I HEAR PEOPLE POINT TO SPIRIT AND OPPORTUNITY AND SAY THAT THESE\nARE EXAMPLES OF WHY WE DON'T NEED TO SEND HUMANS TO MARS, I GET VERY\nUPSET. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT EVEN THE RIGHT DISCUSSION TO BE HAVING. WE\nMUST SEND HUMANS TO MARS. WE CAN'T DO IT SOON ENOUGH FOR ME.\n\"\nBack to Contents page\n\"\nHE\"\n. . . W\"\n. . . W\nSTEVE SQUYRES\nMARS EXPLORATION ROVERS\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nl\nCOBE and the James Webb\nSpace Te escope\nI want to talk to you about the Cosmic Background Explorer\n(COBE) satellite and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), to give you examples of two\nextraordinarily risky visions that I have worked on. One of them hasn't been launched yet\nand one was launched some time ago. So the concentration is on the James Webb Telescope,\nwhich used to be called the Next Generation Space Telescope. We had a lot of Trekkies at\nHeadquarters and they were very proud to name it the Next Generation Space Telescope.\nIt was renamed after NASA Administrator James Webb. I didn't know much about James\nWebb until I read a biography of him and he was in fact a remarkable person and it's a\ntremendous honor for the telescope to have his name attached to it. If you want to know\nmore about it, there's a book called Powering Apollo. It is really very inspiring to read and\nalso points out that he was really very interested in reducing risk by adopting and learning\nabout new methods of management.\nAnd management, I think, is our biggest risk in many areas. Many people have spoken\nbefore about losing concentration on the risks that we face and panicking in the dive or\nwhatever it might be. We have to sort of keep the same focus all the way up to top of the\nmanagement chain, otherwise we get in trouble.\nl\ni\nj\ni\ni\nli\nJohn C. Mather is a senior astrophysicist in the Infrared Astrophysics Branch at NASA/Goddard Space\nFlight Center. His research centers on infrared astronomy and cosmology. As an National Research\nCouncil postdoctoral fellow at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (New York City), he led the proposal\nefforts for the Cosmic Background Explorer (1974-76), and came to Goddard Space Flight Center to\nbe the study scientist (1976-88), project scientist (1988-present), and also the principal investigator for\nthe Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) on COBE. He showed that the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation has a blackbody spectrum within 50 parts per million. As study scientist (1995-99)\nand project scientist (1999-present) for the James Webb Space Telescope, he coleads the science team\nwith Peter Stockman (STScI) and represents scientific interests within the project management.\nJohn Mather\nJames Webb Space Te escope Sen or Pro ect Sc ent st, NASA Goddard Space F ght Center\n\nSo, what do I think risks are? There are a lot of things that people call\nrisks that aren't, to my way of thinking. Some things are intrinsically chancy,\nyou couldn't possibly predict whether they would or would not happen. And we\nhave done a lot of things to reduce those risks by working harder and harder on\nwhat you can control and predict. But, also, there are a lot of things that depend\non who's working on it, who's thinking about it, who's paying. And if you're the\nmanagement paying to reduce risks and you have another person breathing down\non you saying, \"If you spend any more money on that project, you're out,\" there\nare a lot of kinds of risk that people feel and take.\nSo why should we take risks? Well, exploration and science are always about\nthe unknown, and that's intrinsically the nature of it. So that's why we're here.\nThe first project that I did was a mission to measure the primordial cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation in a couple of different ways, and to look for the\naccumulated light of the first galaxies. And we did actually succeed in all of these\nobjectives with the COBE satellite. This project was\nremarkably risky, considering when it was proposed and\nwhat it was like at the time. This was proposed in 1974.\nI organized a team six months out of graduate school to\npropose this mission, and when NASA decided to take\nus on as a serious study, they were taking a risk on us.\nBut we did actually get associated with a truly wonderful\nengineering team at Goddard Space Flight Center and\nthey produced this whole thing. It was an in-house\nproject, which is not one of the more common ways that\nwe do projects at NASA. But it was a wonderful thing for\nthis project.\nIn 1974 people did not have computers on every\ndesk. We did our first engineering drawings with pencils.\nAnd our calculators, our computers, were HP35s, and it\nwas a miracle to have one. So people thought differently\nabout risk because there was just too much you could\nnever figure out or calculate. You did not have a finite-\nelement model of everything you wanted. You just\nsaid, \"Well, I think that'll probably work.\" And sometimes you were right and\nsometimes you weren't.\nSo then there was testing. This went through two metamorphoses. COBE\nwas proposed first as payload for a Delta rocket. Then NASA went and put all of\nits eggs in one basket with a lot of kick from Congress and said, \"We're killing all\nthe expendable launch vehicles. We're going to send everything up on Shuttles.\"\nSo this was redesigned to go on a Shuttle and it was a 10,000-pound spacecraft\nthat had to go up from California. As far as I know, it was the only scientific\npayload that was to have the Shuttle launch from California.\nThen the Challenger happened when we had more or less completed our\ndesign and were putting our spacecraft together. And it became pretty clear that\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAn artist's impression of the selected\ndesign for the JWST spacecraft.\n(Image copyright European Space\nAgency)\nA map depicting the distribution of cosmic background radiation, as\ndetected by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) spacecraft.\n(NASA Image # 90-HC-640)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nthere was not going to be a Shuttle launch from California ever again, and it\nwasn't just because the Shuttles were dangerous--there wasn't enough traffic\nfor the purpose.\nSo we had to rebuild it all. We had also about a 30-month schedule we had\nto meet to rebuild everything. Fortunately, we did have the instruments that were\nmore or less complete. And the business end did not really have to change much.\nBut everything below that did have to change, and it was all new mechanical and\nthermal structures.\nSo our Deputy Project Manager took a risk. He started hunting around in\nthe rest of the world for a foreign launch vehicle, and Headquarters informed him\nthat he would lose some body parts if he kept on doing that, and that was a risk.\nHeadquarters did, however, recognize that potentially this mission could be the\nfirst new science mission to go up after the Challenger. And so they said, \"Well,\nif we could get you a Delta, could you fit?\" So the answer was: \"Yeah, just barely.\"\nAnd so the Delta was found. It had to be brought together from the spare parts\nleft around in hangars elsewhere and pigeon droppings had eaten holes through\nthe tanks in a few places. They were welded closed. So some of the stuff was a\nlittle bit of a risk.\nBut that was not the hard part. There were quite a few other kinds of\nrisks in here. Of the business end, the scientific instruments, two of them were\nlocated inside a helium cryostat, and we had almost no experience with operating\nanything at very low temperatures. Certainly, our space engineering team did not\nknow much about it. We all learned a lot going through this project.\nAnother really tough challenge that afflicted us seriously in the early days\nwas that our budget was always limited. We didn't enjoy the virtue of being a top-\npriority project. So there were quite a lot of things that we did that were probably\nwrong, but we just knew we couldn't get the money to do the thing right.\nHowever, that did change after the Challenger. And, so, the management\napproach changed. Charlie Pellerin came around and said, \"If there's anybody on\nthis project who knows any reason why this isn't right, tell us now.\" And he was\npretty serious that we would have to tell him. He wanted to know the bad news,\nif there was any, because he needed to make sure this was going to turn out. So,\nI think this was an example that management attitude and our ability to raise\nfunds to do the right thing were critically important to success.\nAnyway, the whole story as best I could tell it is recorded in a book called\nThe Very First Light. It's about ten years ago now, and it was written for a general\n\" \"\n. . . MY FIRST THING IS, IF IT'S NOT TESTED, IT WILL FAIL, AND\nTHAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO FIX IT EITHER.\n\"\n\"\nJOHN MATHER\nCOBE AND THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE\n\naudience. People told me afterwards they were out of breath from reading it\nbecause there were so many hazards that we faced and recovered from; and I\nthink that's not unusual in the space business.\nBut it was worth it. We showed the spectrum of the universe is a perfect\nblackbody spectrum for a temperature of 2.725 plus or minus .001 Kelvin, which\nin its earlier incarnation brought us a standing ovation when we showed it to the\nAmerican Astronomical Society. The question of whether the Big Bang theory\nwas correct at all was still a somewhat open issue when this was reported. And\nto produce such a perfect measurement was tremendous cause for a celebration.\nAnd all the critics finally had to give up and agree that, well, maybe the Big Bang\nwas really right. A map of the brightness of that background radiation over the\nentire sky was used to not only confirm the Big Bang story, but also to start in on\nthe question of what's the rest of the universe like? The map and the details tell\nus basically that it's true--we're only 4 percent of the total universe, the matter\nthat we know about. There's something like 20 percent more dark matter that\nstill has attractive gravity. And we weren't quite sure then, but we were beginning\nto get onto it, that there's also a repulsion force that causes the acceleration of\nthe universe. The universe is going faster and faster, and danged if I know what\nthat's about! A lot of people have guesses, none of which we can confirm as yet.\nSo this is a very open subject.\nSo these two results basically started up immense industries. There has\nalready been a successor spacecraft for the measurement of the map and it's\ndone far better. There's another one planned, and another one is hoped for after\nthat. So we have made tremendous results out of this project, which seemed\nextremely risky technically.\nNow, I want to go on to something that's perhaps easier in a sense, but\nmuch more difficult in another, the James Webb Space Telescope. This mission\nis the scientific successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and it was conceived a\nlong time ago, back in 1995, as the successor. And it's a scientific successor, but\nnot a replacement. A lot of people are very concerned about what the future of\nHubble is, and for anyone who cares, this is not a replacement.\nThis is not doing what Hubble does. This is looking farther away into\nthe very distant universe and looking deeper into the places where stars and\nplanets are being made, and it's much more challenging in a different way. To\naccomplish the objectives we need a much bigger telescope than Hubble. Well,\nhow are you going to do that? Well, I'll show you. It also needs to be very, very\ncold because we need to see infrared light. The most distant universe is red-\nshifted, as it appears to us. The ultraviolet light that was emitted by those most\ndistant things we want to see comes out in the infrared. And the visible light and\nother things come out in much longer infrared wavelengths. So we have to have a\nfull telescope, and we are driven to a solution that happens in deep space. So we\ncouldn't find any way around it. We sure knew that it would be great if we could\nservice this mission as the Hubble had been serviced. We could not find a design\nthat would allow that.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nSo we did negotiate a deal with the European and Canadian Space Agency\nand we did get the blessing of the National Academy of Sciences that this was the\nnext big thing. It is a vision which strikes fear and trembling into the hearts of\nengineers, because the payload escapes from the Earth. It's going to go a million\nmiles away from the Earth and when it gets partway out there it's going to deploy.\nAnd deployment in mechanical devices also terrified many engineers. We've had\na lot of trouble with mechanical things and they're plenty right to be worried\nabout it. It's got its solar arrays to deploy, then a solar baffle, a heat shield, then\ngraphite fiber poles, a little bit stouter than fishing poles but not a whole lot. The\nshield pops open and becomes five layers. The five-layer shield is a much better\nthermal shield. Then a support tower is erected and the secondary mirror comes\nout and deploys on its linkages. The gold-coated primary mirror there is made\nout of beryllium hexagons, but it's coated with gold. And it deploys one wing of\nthe hexagon, and now the other wing.\nIt's a million miles away. It's a million miles in the opposite direction from\nthe Sun. There's a point called the Lagrange point L2 where it's a semi-stable\norbit. And if you hovered around that spot, you could stay there with only a small\nnudge and move around the Sun with the Earth all year long.\nSo that's where we're going. This is the thing that's supposed to go there.\nAnd if you had asked us ten years ago if this was going to work, people would\nlaugh at you and say, \"Nah, you couldn't do anything like that.\" The company\nthat's building this for us is Northrop Grumman. It's next to L.A. airport. And\nthey tell us that they've actually deployed many, many things in space for other\ngovernment agencies which they can't tell us about! But there is a reason why\nthis technology was much more mature than astronomers ever imagined.\nSo, anyway, there's an awful lot of engineering risk in that thing. We\nhad altogether twelve contracts to learn how to build the ultra-lightweight\nmirror that we need. The mirror is a chunk of beryllium, which is polished to\nthe required accuracy. And we've proven that it will stay the right shape when\nit cools down. So this is a truly remarkable accomplishment. And, jeepers, it\nlooks just like a mirror, doesn't it? But it took years and years of cooperative\ntechnology and competition.\nNow, I want to show you the result as a formal tool that we use for analyzing\nrisk. If we didn't have a formal tool I'm convinced we could never get there,\nbecause the way that we did risk analysis for the COBE project was: \"Well, I\nthink it'll work or I think it won't.\" Now we have a very formal process. We\nhave a giant risk database. Our risk manager is here if you want to ask her more\nquestions about it.\nBut we have engineers that fill out forms and we have weekly meetings,\nand we keep track of every single thing that we're worried about. And sometimes\nwe retire it and sometimes we say, \"Oh, it's getting worse,\" and we have to do\nsomething more vigorous about it. At least three of the top issues for us were\nquestions about people--you know, can the agencies agree on something? So\nthis is an example that's very typical, that some of the hardest problems are\nJOHN MATHER\nCOBE AND THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nnegotiations. And I just wanted to emphasize that we have a method for doing\nthis, and never to forget what the problems are.\nI wanted to share some of my observations of physical things with you.\nAnd this, I have to admit, started with my learning experiences in school. I had a\nthesis project which failed on its first flight, and I learned a lot from that failure.\nAnd I know how we got into that mind-set that said, \"Well, let's fly it anyway.\"\nWe were tired, and we didn't have any more money. However, this thing did not\nwork for three different reasons and so I learned something.\nSo, my first thing is, if it's not tested, it will fail, and that you probably\nwon't be able to fix it either. And sometimes if it is tested, it will fail anyway, but\nat least you'll have a chance to fix it. But it will cost you. If you don't have a spare\npart or a backup plan, it will definitely fail. And if you only test it a little bit to see\nif it will do what it's supposed to do, then it'll do something else. So I've come\nto a similar conclusion to what Steve Squyres was recommending: You need lots\nof hardware around to work with, because things are going to go wrong and you\nneed to be able to test out your idea on one thing while you're fixing the other\none. So you need to have a lot of smart people thinking a lot about really terrible\nthings, things that could go wrong and might just go wrong, and not being too\nlimited to thinking about the things that you only know you can fix. Things that\nhave the highest consequence will often be things that you missed because, you\nknow, \"Oh, I can't fix that.\" So you need lots of external review and we do have\nlots of external review. And so that's the number one thing.\nThere's another issue, about individual people. I don't think that human\nbeings as a group are particularly good at balancing lots of likelihood and\nconsequence. I know a lot of people [who] have fallen off of things and hurt\nthemselves badly, including one of our senior managers on the COBE project--\nafter he retired, fortunately for the project. So we're not really good at this. We\nneed a formal tool. And we have a formal tool, but if you don't use it, you will\ndefinitely be in trouble! That's a conclusion from this.\nSo I think our greatest risk is lack of imagination. A lot of imaginary things\nyou just have to explore. Once you've decided where you're going to go with what\nyou get from your imagination, then you have to imagine all the things that could\ngo wrong. You have to rehearse all that. If you were a performer, as my wife is, then\nyou rehearse before you go out on stage. And people who are successful in our\nbusiness rehearse and rehearse and rehearse, too. But I know that, at least in my\nhistory, we have been very easily blinded by thinking about what we have to work\nwith rather than is it actually required? Nature doesn't really care whether we have\nenough resources to think about this problem. Either we did it right, or we didn't.\nIf you didn't build it right and you think of this fact, then you better tell people\nand get the resources. Otherwise, you might as well not have started.\n■\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\nBack to Contents page\n\nFrom the Earth to the Moon\nI'm just a Hollywood screenwriter, and when I look at the\npeople on this panel, I think I'm the answer to: \"What's wrong with this picture?\" The other\nthing that comes to mind is my Mission to Mars credit. There's a thing in Hollywood where\nyou fight hard to get credit on something, because you'll usually get some money when the\nDVD sells. And you have to weigh the value of that money versus being humiliated in front\nof people at NASA for having been involved in a movie as bad as Mission to Mars. So--I\nreally don't know if it was worth it. But anyway . . .\nIn 1996 I got a call from my agent and she said that Tom Hanks was doing a history\nof the Apollo program for HBO and did I want to be involved, and I said, \"Sign me up.\"\nI read the outlines that they had prepared and I read Andy Chaikin's book. The episode\nthat jumped out at me for dramatic purposes was the episode that, at that point, was then\ncalled \"The Fire.\" It was later re-titled, for good reason, \"Apollo I.\" They said, \"Sorry, that's\nalready taken by another writer.\" And the next day, I got a call that the writer had dropped\nout, so I got a chance to write that episode. In a very personally selfish way, that changed\nmy career. Up until that point, I'd been an action writer. I did Speed and Broken Arrow and\nFrom the Earth to the Moon (1998), Mission to Mars\nSpeed,\nstarring Keanu Reeves.\ni\ni\nGraham Yost is a writer/director from Toronto, Canada.

And I remember the highest\ncompliment that I got was, at one point, Frank Darabont was going to direct the\nepisode--Frank Darabont has directed The Shawshank Redemption\nThe Green\n. He said while he was reading it, he kept on flipping back to the title page\nand saying, \"This is the bus guy?\"\nAs a little Canadian boy, I watched the Moon program from Canada and\njust loved it, which is why I said I wanted to be on board--but it made me a true\nspace geek. The term on Earth to the Moon was \"you've become a helmet-sniffer,\nif anyone knows the term from sports. That's why I'm here. And we would follow\naround Dave Scott, our astronaut adviser, and I remember telling my wife, \"I just\nkeep looking at his feet,\" because those feet were on the Moon.\nIn the writing of this episode, \"Apollo 1,\" I decided very early on that I\nwanted to focus on Frank Borman, who was part of the Apollo 1--it was actually,\ntechnically, called the Apollo 204 Review Board. We're going to show a clip from\nthe episode. So this is Frank Borman. It's later on in the episode and it's Frank\nBorman, played by David Andrews, who's testifying in front of a Senate committee.\nAnd I made Walter Mondale the bad guy, but that's a whole other story.\n[Dialogue from video clip is indented.]\nSenator\nColonel Borman, would you have entered the\nspacecraft on the morning of the accident if your turn had been\ncalled?\nFrank Borman: Yes, sir.\nSenator Mondale: Would you have had any hesitancy?\nFrank Borman: No, sir.\nSenator Mondale: Were there defects in workmanship?\nFrank Borman: There were.\nSenator Mondale: And did these defects go beyond workmanship?\nFrank Borman: Yes, sir, there were defects in design.\nSenator Mondale: If you had entered that spacecraft on that morning,\nwould you have been motivated by a desire to take risks?\nFrank Borman: No, sir. Sometimes there are romantic, silk-scarf\nnotions attributed to this business, but we're professionals. We will\naccept it, certainly, but not undue risks.\nSenator Mondale: Let me rephrase the question. Knowing what you\nknow now, would you have entered that spacecraft?\nFrank Borman: No, sir.\nSenator Mondale: Colonel Borman, how did Commander Grissom\nand his crew feel about the readiness of the vehicle?\nFrank Borman: I talked to Ed White shortly before the accident.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAstronaut James A. Lovell, Jr.,\nbefore members of the Senate Space\nCommittee about the problems of the\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nHe thought they were over most of their problems and were on\ntheir way . . .\nSenator Mondale: Didn't Commander Grissom once hang a lemon on\nthe simulator?\nFrank Borman: You had to know Gus.\nSenator Mondale: Did Commander Grissom\nhang a lemon on the simulator?\nFrank Borman: Yes, sir.\nSecond Senator: [interrupts Mondale] Tell us\nabout him, Colonel. Sorry, Senator, I just have a\ncouple of quick questions. Would you yield for\na minute or two?\nSenator Mondale: Actually, Mr. Chairman, I--\nSecond Senator: Thanks. Colonel Borman,\nyou just said, \"You had to know Gus.\" And I\nthink that that's been missing in here the past\nfew days. I'd like the record to contain just a\nlittle about the men who perished in that fire.\nColonel, could you do that for us?\nFrank Borman: Gus Grissom was the first\nastronaut to be asked to fly three times.\nMercury, Gemini, and Apollo. He loved being\nan astronaut, except for the publicity and\ndisplay that comes with the job. There are no\nfront windows on the house he built for Betty\nin Timber Cove because he didn't want people\nlooking in. If that gives you the impression that\nGus was a cranky SOB, well, he was, at times.\nBut I would have trusted him with my life.\nEd White was a big man for an astronaut, a\nshade under six feet. As you well know, Ed was\nthe first American to walk in space. There's a\nstory going around that when he was on his\nspacewalk, he stayed out after he had been ordered in because he was\nhaving such a good time. Funny story, but it would have meant Ed\nWhite disobeyed an order. Not going to happen. Ed was a West Point\nman. Duty, honor, country were not just words to him. He was one\nof my closest friends.\nRoger Chaffee, I didn't know that well. He was one of the new guys,\nvery energetic, very excited. I heard a story about him, though. He\nwas out on Long Island visiting the Grumman facility where they\nwere building the descent stage of the lunar module. He saw a group\nThis photograph shows the crew in training for the ill-fated\nApollo/Saturn 204 mission, more commonly known as Apollo 1. On\n27 January 1967, a sudden fire broke out in the command module\nduring a launchpad test. All three of the primary crew--astronauts\nVirgil \"Gus\" Ivan Grissom, Edward Higgins White II, and Roger\nBruce Chaffee--perished.\n(NASA Image # 66-HC-1834)\nGRAHAM YOST\nFROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON\n\nof men standing in the corner. He found out these were the fellows\nthat make the tools that make the machines. None of the big wigs\nthat were escorted through there ever talked to these guys. But Roger\nwent over and made them feel like they were the most important\npart of the program.\nSecond Senator: Colonel, this isn't a court of law, so I can ask you\nsomething that's completely hypothetical. If you could somehow\nreach beyond the wall of death and talk to Grissom, White, and\nChaffee, what do you imagine they would say about the fire?\nFrank Borman: I was--I was hoping that someone would ask that.\nI don't know what Roger or Ed would say, but I can let Gus speak\nfor himself. Back in January, he talked to a group of reporters. They\nasked him about the dangers involved in going to the Moon.\n[Additional indentation to set off reminiscence of Grissom\nspeaking.]\nGus Grissom: We're in a risky business, and we hope if anything\nhappens to us, it will not delay the program. The conquest of\nspace is worth the risk of life. Our God-given curiosity will\nforce us to go there ourselves, because in the final analysis,\nonly man can fully evaluate the Moon in terms understandable\nto other men.\nSecond Senator: Colonel, at the risk of being gruesome, we've heard\nabout the fire from everyone who was there, everyone except the\nastronauts themselves, of course. Can you tell me what they went\nthrough? What it was like for them?\nFrank Borman: I can only tell you what we know or, at least, what we\nthink we know. When it happened, they were just waiting for the test\nto resume.\n[Additional indentation to set off flashbacks to astronauts caught in\nApollo I fire.]\nGus Grissom: How are we going to get to the Moon if we can't\ntalk between three buildings? I can't hear a thing you're saying.\nJesus Christ, I said, how are we going to get to the Moon if we\ncan't talk between two or three buildings?\nFrank Borman: They didn't see the spark that caused the fire because\nit was behind the panel door, down below Gus's feet. Because of the\noxygen, the spark was able to jump out into the netting under the\nseats. Gus probably saw it first because it was closest to him.\nAstronaut: Fire! We have fire!\nFrank Borman: Procedure would have had Gus push down Ed's\nheadrest so that Ed could have started turning the latches.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nAstronaut: We have a bad fire! [pause] Hurry up!\nFrank Borman: Now, it just took me a minute or more to tell you all\nthat. In actuality, from the first mention of the fire to the rupture of\nthe hull only 15 seconds went by.\nSecond Senator: Colonel, what caused the fire? I'm not talking about\nwires and oxygen. It seems that some people think that NASA\npressured North American to meet unrealistic and arbitrary deadlines\nand that in turn North American allowed safety to be compromised.\nFrank Borman: I won't deny that there's been pressure to meet\ndeadlines but safety has never been intentionally compromised.\nSecond Senator: Then what caused the fire?\nFrank Borman: A failure of imagination. We've always known there\nwas the possibility of a fire in a spacecraft. But the fear was always\nthat it would happen in space when you were 180 miles from terra\nfirma and the nearest fire station. That was the worry. No one ever\nimagined that it would happen on the ground. If anyone had thought\nof it, the test would have been classified as hazardous. But it wasn't.\nWe just didn't think of it. Now whose fault is that? Well, it's North\nAmerican's fault. It's NASA's fault. It's the fault of every person\nwho ever worked on Apollo. It's my fault. I didn't think the test was\nhazardous. No one did. I wish to God we had.\nSecond Senator: Now before we all go home, is there any statement\nyou personally would like to make?\nFrank Borman: I think I'm safe in speaking for all the astronauts when\nI say that we are confident in our management. We're confident in\nour training, in our engineering, and in ourselves. The real question\nis, are you confident in us?\nSecond Senator: What do you think we should do Colonel?\nFrank Borman: I think you should stop this witch-hunt and let us go\nto the Moon. [Applause]\nSecond Senator: Senator Mondale, back to you.\nSenator Mondale: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have nothing further.\nSecond Senator: Thank you, Colonel.\n[End of video clip]\nJohn Grunsfeld: I'm going to exercise my executive privilege here for just\na minute, and I'll let Graham continue, but, Graham, this is why we invited you.\nI can't help watching that without getting a little tear in my eye. I've been up\nat NASA Headquarters for a little over a year. When I came to Headquarters\nafter the loss of Columbia it was because of the pain that I felt for the crew and\nmy friends and this kind of circumstance. When I started watching this video\nGRAHAM YOST\nFROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON\n\nI thought, welcome to Mr. O'Keefe's world. And Bill Readdy's world. And all of\nus here from NASA who had to suffer through the loss of Columbia and crew.\nThis really does address the central issue that we're here to discuss, which is\nhow do we decide, when do we decide to go on, given the loss of our friends, for\nsomething we all believe is crucially important personally, professionally, for the\nplanet, and for our friends.\nI know Mr. O'Keefe has to leave in just a little bit, but I'd like to take this\nopportunity just to thank you as, hopefully, folks thank James Webb for the\nperseverance, the energy. For those of you who [don't] know me, I am an intense\nworkaholic. I can look to a few members in the audience who are shaking their\nheads in agreement and Mr. O'Keefe, you're the first person that I have been\nunable to keep up with. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for helping\nsponsor this risk symposium.\nI think in a nutshell that things like that video clip show the key to\ncommunicating this risk to the public effectively. So, back to you.\nGraham Yost: Thank you very much. After working on Earth to the Moon,\nI was looked at in Hollywood as the guy who, if NASA ever had a problem, would\nwrite the thing about it. So I became the disaster guy. This was also incredibly\ntough. I wrote a screenplay in '99 on Challenger. That has never been produced.\nPartly because, I think--it was for 20th Century Fox--and they were looking for\nwhite hats and black hats, and what I found was human beings.\nThen, I got to work for HBO on a thing on Mir and looked at Jerry Linenger's\nexperiences up there and the fire that they had. Also Mike Foale and the docking\nincident. At any rate, though, Earth to the Moon was the focus for me in risk.\nWe shot it mostly in Florida. We did the lunar surface stuff outside of L.A., but\nwe shot the rest of it in Florida. Our joke at the time was, just like the Moon\nprogram, we're thousands of miles from home, we're spending way too much\nmoney, and it's taking too long. The difference was, and it's been mentioned\nabout the robotic missions, there were risks to career, risks to family, but there\nreally, ultimately, was no risking of life in doing a miniseries for HBO and hanging\nout with Tom Hanks. That's not a hard thing.\nBut when I think about risk as I've heard over the past couple of days,\nI'm reminded of George Carlin's famous line--judging risk is very subjective.\n\"\n\"\nTHIS REALLY DOES ADDRESS THE CENTRAL ISSUE THAT WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS,\nWHICH IS HOW DO WE DECIDE, WHEN DO WE DECIDE TO GO ON, GIVEN THE LOSS\nOF OUR FRIENDS, FOR SOMETHING WE ALL BELIEVE IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT\nPERSONALLY, PROFESSIONALLY, FOR THE PLANET, AND FOR OUR FRIENDS.\n\"\n\"\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nGeorge Carlin's line about driving was, \"Have you ever noticed, anyone driving\nslower than you is an idiot and anyone who's driving faster is a maniac?\" In\nhearing some of the things, we feel like we can somehow judge our own risk\nlevel. We know what we can handle. The classic subjective thing is flying versus\ndriving. We know statistically flying is lot safer, and, yet, somehow, we feel that\nif we're in charge, we can handle that risk. I remember when I was living in New\nYork and some crime had happened to a stranger. That was the thing we were\nalways concerned with, stranger on stranger crime. You would find out when it\nhappened and where it happened and you'd say, \"Oh, I never would have been\nthere.\" So, it's not risky.\nIn terms of Apollo, as I said, one of the great honors of doing Earth to the\nMoon was meeting the astronauts and spending a lot of time with Dave Scott. I\ngot to direct the episode about Apollo 9. So I spent a lot of time with him talking\nabout that. I also worked with him getting the script ready for the episode covering\nthe Apollo 15 mission. He told me that there was a big discussion about what\nthe rover walk-back limit on it would be, how far the rover could go before, if it\nbroke down, they would have to walk back to the LEM. The proposal was that they\nshould have--I forget the term--it was like a double walk-back limit or something.\nBecause, what if the rover failed and one of the Portable Life Support System (PLSS)\nbackpacks failed, that they should be able to go back on one PLSS backpack. Dave\nsaid, \"No. That's just going to hamper us too much. That's going to hamstring us.\nWe need to go as far as the single walk-back limit.\" I said, \"Well, what would have\nhappened if you had a PLSS failure and a rover failure?\" He said, \"Well, we would\nhave had a bad day.\" That was his perspective, and that was his choice.\nThinking about risk and NASA and space exploration, you have to realize\nthat people like Shannon Lucid and people like [Harrison] Jack Schmitt and the\nother astronauts, they're perfectly capable of judging whether or not something\nis safe. Just like David Andrews, Borman is saying: We know what we're willing\nto take. The reality is that space exploration, unlike the Magellan voyages, has\nbeen a volunteer thing. There's been no torturing of astronauts and telling them\nthat they have to go into space. Which again, may not be a bad idea. [Laughter]\nIt's important not to rule anything out.\nThis does bring up the other project I worked on in which that was always\none of the questions. Judy Resnik and Dick Scobee and Elison Onizuka knew what\nthey were dealing with in spaceflight but did Christa McAuliffe really know? Did\nGreg Jarvis really know? The thing is, they were told. They were told as well\nas anyone can communicate to them. It's not about statistics. Dick Scobee told\nChrista McAuliffe the classic line, \"When you launch the Shuttle, everyone is at\nleast three miles away except for us. We're going to be sitting on top.\" For me, in\nresearching Challenger--and again it's probably one of the reasons it didn't get\nproduced--was that the problem with Challenger wasn't that NASA somehow\ngot lax with risk. There are all these theories, by the way. I don't know if any\nof you have read these books, but that NASA was pressured to make the launch\nin order to meet up with Reagan's State of the Union address that night and all\nGRAHAM YOST\nFROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON\n\nthis stuff. The future of space was in Reagan's hands, that there was pressure,\npressure, pressure. I think that's absurd, when you look into it, and that's what\nDave Scott would call an \"outside the culture\" view of it. When you get inside,\nyou realize it was just people doing the job they had and the best job they could.\nEveryone working on the program knew the astronauts or met them at some\ntime. There was no laxity in NASA on risk.\nTo me, in looking at it, the problem was with public perception of risk.\nThis has come up again and again over the past couple of days, but because I'm\nlast I get to say it again anyway. What can the public tolerate? What are they\nexpecting? I think that when Challenger happened, NASA was a victim of its\nown success. If you consider Apollo 13 was a close call. We've heard that term\nmentioned, but other than that, it was just a string of successes with manned\nmissions. The expectation in the public rose. There was also media pressure--\nthe media fed into that. There was a classic tape of Peter Jennings on the 26th of\nJanuary--the night before Challenger--saying another on-time departure is too\nmuch of a challenge for Challenger, because there was a socket wrench that they\ncouldn't work.\nBut, the truth be told, NASA at that time was part of the problem, because\nNASA had promised that the Shuttle was going to be a routine access to space.\nAs anyone who I've talked to involved with spaceflight knows, there's no such\nthing. It's not routine. It's not--as Mike Foale said last night--it's not flying a\nbig aircraft. It's something far more complicated and far more risky than that.\nDuring the Presidential Commission on Challenger a figure came up and I don't\nknow the source of it so, if it's not true, forgive me, but it has been said that the\nShuttle stood only a 1 in 100,000 chance of having a disaster. It was Richard\nFeynman, who was on the commission, who worked out the simple math that\nthat means the Shuttle would launch once a day for three hundred years before\nsomething happened. That was an unreal expectation, an unreal offer to the\npublic, that it's going to be that good, that sure.\nThe thing is that we have public accountability. We have a transparent\nprogram. There are problems with that, but I still think the good outweighs the\nbad. In researching the NASA stuff, we also, at one point for Earth to the Moon,\nwe were going to do a special two-hour episode about the Soviet program. It just\nbecame too expensive. One of the things that we found out is that there were\nhorrific accidents. The testing of an N1 with over 1,000 people killed in one\nexplosion. No one ever heard about it. No one in North America ever heard about\nit. No one in Russia heard about it.\nIn fact, I would say that culture of secrecy is something that, as Mike Foale\nsaid last night talking about the docking crash on Mir, contributed to that: The\nidea that we don't have to share everything. We don't have to tell you everything.\nIt's all okay.\nMy closing thoughts have to do with the question of humans versus robots.\nA lot of people have said it's kind of an absurd question. They have to go hand\nin hand. To me, humans versus robots is, frankly, not about risk. Ultimately,\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nit's about money. My feeling in having written about space exploration is that\nthe notion of risk is almost secondary to whether or not we move forward into\nspace. I think the public will bear whatever the risk is because they know that\nthe people involved will bear it. Because the astronauts sign up, because it is\nvoluntary. The question becomes, is the public going to get behind it? The public\nis important because they're paying for it.\nEven though I'm Canadian, I pay American tax dollars. So, it becomes\na public concern. If something happened back in the 1960s to Lockheed or\nGrumman or a North American test, well, that was private enterprise. That's\nokay. That's their deal. That's their pilot. But when it's our pilots, when it's our\nastronauts, then it becomes something that people have to get behind.\nDave Scott told me that Neil Armstrong once gave a presentation saying--\nand this is sort of a gloomy note to end on--but going to the Moon was really\nthe convergence of several important things. The technology was available, the\nmoney, and there was the public will. And I think the big question is going to be\nto get the public will to go back to the Moon and on to Mars. And I don't know\nif it's just a matter of communicating it. I think it is also a matter of, somehow,\nin the zeitgeist, the public has to get behind it. Beating the Soviets was worth it.\nPeople just signed up and said, it's worth it. I think that if we found out that a\nMars base was crucial to protecting us from an asteroid storm or alien invasion,\nwe would be there in 10 years.\nSo what I believe that NASA has to do is to embark on a massive campaign of\ndisinformation and lies. [Loud laughter.] And I pledge to do whatever I can.\n■\n\" \"\nMY FEELING IN HAVING WRITTEN ABOUT SPACE EXPLORATION IS THAT THE NOTION\nOF RISK IS ALMOST SECONDARY TO WHETHER OR NOT WE MOVE FORWARD INTO\nSPACE. I THINK THE PUBLIC WILL BEAR WHATEVER THE RISK IS BECAUSE THEY\nKNOW THAT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WILL BEAR IT.\nBack to Contents page\n\"\n\"\nGRAHAM YOST\nFROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON\n\nDiscussion\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: Welcome back to \"Risk and Exploration.\" Our panelists are eager and\nready to answer and discuss all of your questions and concerns. I imagine that the audience\nhas plenty to offer, so I think what we will do is start. If you do ask a question or make a\ncomment, please make sure and stand up, give your name and affiliation, and wait just a\nmoment for them to cue up your microphone.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I don't quite know how to phrase my question. It's been bothering\nme for the last day and a half. It was illustrated very nicely in the film clip we saw. There's\nan old set of characteristics of projects that has been going around for years, the last two\nof which involved praise and honor for the nonparticipants, and the last one is search for\nthe guilty. The search for the guilty was illustrated there with the cross-examination of the\nastronaut for causing a failure. I guess I have been bothered for years by the fact that there\nalways seems to be a need for institutional witch hunting. Somebody has to be guilty. This\nhas got to be an inhibiting factor for managers and the people who have to make the tough\ndecisions. I wonder how people feel about that. Is it really an inhibiting factor, or do you\nnot think about it?\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: That's a great question. I guess you missed the Barcelona Times in\n1522 when Magellan didn't return, and they started the witch-hunt there. It's an interplay\nbetween Congress, the media, and the transparency that Graham discussed. We want to\nhave a transparent space administration. That's part of our process.\nJIM GARVIN: Sometimes the side effect of that mind-set is stimulated reexamination of\nprograms. It has been said, and I've heard it said here, that we have programs in NASA. The\none I speak for here, the Mars exploration program, continuously reinvents itself, precipitated\nby different types of catalysts. Sometimes they are the big setbacks. We did that after Mars\nObserver--the big witch-hunt of the early '90s. We did it after, as Steve said, the Climate\nOrbiter/Polar Lander issue, and we built a better program. So, that transparency and these\neffects you rarely see sometimes have positive consequences. How to live in the risk world\nwithout them in a highly visible public program is the debate we should all have. In the case\nof Mars, I can say that the level of incisiveness and the view that we took to do the rover, to\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nand\nno\nnor\nmodule pilot, stands near the United States\nlunar landing mission in the Apollo series\n(1972). (NASA Image # AS17-134-20382)\ndo Mars Odyssey, which is still operating, and that we are applying to the Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter has been, perhaps, catalyzed by this mind-set.\nGRAHAM YOST: In researching From Earth to the Moon, the feeling after the fire in\nApollo I and the death of the crew was one of recommitment. The whole program\njust came together stronger and better than before out of that. I remember\nresearching Challenger. There certainly was a witch-hunt, and Larry Malloy at\nMarshall became the fall guy. He once said that he understood that, as the middle\nmanager in a corporation, his neck would be the one to go and his head would be\nthe one to roll. I would say, and everyone here is in NASA after Challenger\nyou will see NASA after Columbia as well, that there is sort of a recommitment. I\nthink, from the outside point of view, it's sort of a program that gets stronger.\nSTEVE SQUYRES: I think it serves\nuseful purpose\nis it in any way\nappropriate to have a search for the guilty parties. It just doesn't do anybody any\ngood and should be avoided. At the same time, you cannot let your desire to avoid\nthat scare you off from a ruthlessly self-critical evaluation of what went wrong.\nT. K. Mattingly last night said that every great success is preceded by failure.\nCertainly that was the case in the case of our mission, and I can tell you right now\nthat the MER [Mars Exploration Rover] mission, as one simple example, would not\nhave succeeded had it not been for the ruthlessly critical self-evaluation that NASA\nundertook of its Mars program, as Gene said, after the loss of MPL [Mars Polar\nLander] and MCO [Mars Climate Orbiter]. I think the CAIB, the Columbia Accident\nInvestigation Board, that Scott Hubbard was a part of, was a very necessary process.\nIt was ruthlessly critical of the Agency in ways that were necessary and ways that\nwill save lives in the future. We shouldn't have a witch-hunt, but you can't let it\nscare you off from doing a job you have to do when something goes wrong.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I would like to add that I do picture myself sitting in\nFrank Borman's chair down here answering the questions. Now, you've said it\nwas a good idea. You just gave up because you couldn't get the resources? Well,\nwhat kind of man are you, you know? It gives a person a little more courage to go\ntell the uncomfortable truth that you might have to tell sometimes.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think one of the questions that comes up as far as\ntesting is the James Webb Space Telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope is\na big telescope. That's why it has all that deployment, and it is still too small to\ndo certain types of work that we know we would want to do at the end of the next\ndecade: look for earth-type planets around nearby stars. I find that a compelling\ngoal, and we need a bigger telescope. It will almost certainly be too big to test\non planet Earth, and that gets back into the humans and robotic partnership. At\nwhat point are our goals important enough, our objectives well known, that the\nscale is such that we cannot test it on planet Earth? In the integrated test such\nthat we might want to employ robots and/or humans as we do in the Hubble\nSpace Telescope to check it out, how do you make that call? I know that this is\nsomething you've thought about, John.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAstronaut Harrison H. \"Jack\" Schmitt, lunar\nflag on the lunar surface during NASA's final\n\nDISCUSSION\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I would think that we have to do everything that\nwe can with robots because they are probably quicker in most areas, and there\nwill be some things they cannot do alone. When it comes to our dreams of big\ntelescopes to find planets around other stars, I think we have to be really diligent\nin searching for ways to test them on the ground also. We just shouldn't give up\non testing them on the ground, because I despair of convincing Congress that\nthey have to fund us when we can't test it before we fly it. So, I think we have to\nbe very, very imaginative about finding ways to test on the ground. We then still\nhave to figure out that it's maybe not going to work.\nThere are some things we cannot adjust in the final stage and we cannot\nconfirm on the ground. We have in mind flying constellations of telescopes that\ncollect light from several different places and funnel it through a single combiner\nin the middle in an interferometer configuration, and with this method, you\ncan build up the image sharpness that you would have from a telescope that is\nhundreds of meters, maybe kilometers or hundreds of kilometers across. You\nmight want to do that to find out about those planets around other stars, but\nwe just have no hope of testing that on the ground. Still, we must prove that it's\ngoing to work when you get there, so what are you going to use? Imagination? I\ncouldn't tell you the answer today.\nJIM GARVIN: We actually did experiments on the Moon with Apollo that you\ncouldn't have tested on the Earth. The human beings, the crew set up some of\nthe impressive arrays that we used to study the interior of the Moon and then\nexperienced the collision of leftover space vehicles to generate a pulse; [that] was\na novel, imaginative experiment that we did. I think there's an example of that.\nBut there was something that we call Robotic Sample Return to bring back pieces\nof Mars to Earth. Some of us call it \"Apollo without the astronauts\" because of\nthe complexity. The reason for that mission is because there are some things we\nthink can only be done, at least until we reach projected technology state, with\npeople in the loop. We either move a lot of people to Mars, and some of us would\nlike to go, or we bring stuff back from Mars so the people here can work on it.\nBecause of the testing limitations, you're there.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: One important point that I think is just good to get\non tape is that there is no such thing as pure robotic exploration. The stuff comes\nback to the people who want to understand the science, so people are always\ninvolved. It's just a question of where are the people in proximity to the context.\nThat's the evidence.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Thank you, David Roberts. Problem for Jim Garvin\nand Steve Squyres and the panel. Besides Mars and Europa, what would be the\nlikely planets or satellites for the next landers? Why? If possible, when?\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: First, you left out the Moon. Going back to the Moon,\nit's a planet in its own right. While we visited tremendously with the humans,\ngetting back there is a scientific and human operation proving ground. Mars is\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nLanding on\nand\nSTEVE SQUYRES: I think\nit\nI'm glad\ncentral to our vision, our implementation plan. So the Moon is a place. In fact,\ncontrary to common belief, although not contrary to the science community,\nthe Moon offers an interesting context for astrobiology. There's the question of\nearly planetary crusts in which there may be aspects of our own history in the\norigins of life from which you gain context. Other than that, I would submit that\nit's a reconnaissance that will help answer that question. You named Europa.\nIn January [2005], we will have the descent of the Huygens probe as part of\nthe mission to Titan, unquestionably one of the most interesting objects in\nour solar system, certainly from the standpoint of planetary atmospheres and\nenvironments.\nthat surface\nsustaining landed experiments\nbeyond the scope of Huygens is a wonderful step. We have a mission called Dawn\nthat will visit two of the main belt asteroids, which are really planetary objects\nin their own right, Vesta and Ceres in this case, and landing on them, by virtue\nof what we find from the first nonlanded experiments that we'll be doing, I think\nis important. But I don't want to leave out Venus. Twelve impressive landings\nby our Soviet colleagues have left many questions that are so fundamental to\nunderstanding how big, rocky planets work, and their atmospheres, that we have\nno clue about. And, yet, that poses a risk challenge to sustain operations there\nrobotically. I don't know whether the crews want to go yet, John, a little bit hard\nto get back in the gravity wall. There are a lot of places where landed experiments\nas a forerunner to sample returns and, ultimately, human landings, in my view,\nare important parts of our strategy.\nyou answered\nwell. Actually,\nyou\nmentioned Venus because, you know, we have Venus, Earth, and Mars, and it\nbrings us back to comments that Jean-Michel Cousteau and Sylvia Earle made\nthis morning, which are, we like this planet, this is a nice planet we live on.\nAnd we also know we don't want to end up like Venus or Mars, and we don't\nunderstand any of them, including the Earth, all that well.\nDAVID HALPERN: I'm happy somebody just mentioned Venus and Mars and the\nEarth. The point that was being made in the morning is not so much we don't\nwant to end up like Venus with the hot house or the greenhouse gas--that's a\nseparate issue. The simplest fact is that we know the topography--the ups and\ndowns and the curves of Venus and Mars--to a much, much greater extent than\nwe know the bottom of the ocean. That was one of the points that we were trying\nto make in the morning.\nWhen it comes to exploration, if you want to explore, like Lewis and Clark,\na continental area, what do you do? You first go there and you see what the height\nis and what the elevation is and where the streams are and where the gullies are.\nBut we don't know that in the ocean. And the point that was being made--and\nthen I think there was another comment made this afternoon--about 96 percent\nof the universe we don't know. Well, we don't even know 95 percent of the ocean.\nSo, I just want to reiterate the point from this morning.\n\nDISCUSSION\nand\nj\nJOE FULLER: Joe Fuller, Futron Corporation. Right now, we're spending a lot of\ntime, energy, resources, imaginations to reduce the risk associated with return\nto flight. And even though I'm sure everybody's going to do everything they can,\nthere will still be risks. And if we think the unthinkable, what if there's another\naccident, you know, on the very next mission? It would have a devastating\nconsequence. How do we get ahead of the curve in mitigating the risk of, you\nknow, such a situation? I guess I'll refer to Graham Yost--he got very close to it\nin talking about, you know, dealing with the public.\nGRAHAM YOST: Again, I think it comes back to the victim of success. The\nmanned spaceflight in America has not been like test flight in America, where\nthey had accidents all the time back in the '50s and people just kind of got used\nto that. God forbid, you know, that manned spaceflight had been like that. But\nit's hard to say what the public appetite is. Someone was asking me at the break\nabout that, and I do maintain that the public is in many ways more concerned--I\nbelieve and I may be totally wrong in this--they're more concerned about the\ncost of things, because it's a pocketbook issue, than they are about the human\nrisk. They're concerned about the human risk, but I think that they do feel that\neveryone is doing absolutely everything they can to make sure these people get\nback safely. I think that's just the tradition of the American spaceflight. And, so,\nI don't know what would happen to the Shuttle program. And, God forbid, you\nknow, it took a long time, relatively, between Challenger\nColumbia. That was\na lot of flights, and it doesn't excuse it or make it okay, it's such an incredibly\ncomplicated machine--you all know. And the public doesn't know. But I think\nthat the public accepts just the basic notion that it's risky.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I don't know how Shannon feels, but I know for myself\nI'm more amazed each time we launch a Shuttle when you think of the tens of\nthousands of pieces, you know, that are checked out in the few seconds just prior\nto launch that all have to pass those checks before we actually leave. And the tens\nof thousands of people that all have to do their ob just right before that Shuttle\nwill leave the ground. It's always amazing to me that we do leave. I'm always a\nlittle surprised, when I'm in the vehicle, that we actually leave. I sort of prepare\nmyself for that, you know, late countdown shutdown for some parameter out of\nlimits, which many of us have experienced.\nAt the same time, Shannon, how do you compartmentalize? I know I do\nthat. When I'm in the Shuttle thinking about the mission, I put the risk part of it,\nthe scary part, in a little compartment, and it never really occurs to me when we're\nsitting out on the launch pad on four-and-a-half million pounds of explosives.\nSHANNON LUCID: Well, you've made the decision that's what you're going to\ndo and you've worked with the people that are doing everything. You've worked\nwith the flight control team, you've worked with the Cape people, you know.\nAnd you know that they're doing the very best that they can. You know that\nthey're only human; you know that mistakes can be made. And you've made your\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nj\ndecision and that's what you're going to do. You don't sit there and analyze it and\nsay, \"What if?\" at that time.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: That's right. In specific, we talk about the team aspects. And,\nas risk takers, regardless of whether it's earth, sea, or the stars, when you get into\nthe vehicle or into the environment, ultimately, you have to trust those people\nwho are making the decisions, and management, that they've done everything\nthat they can. And often we talk about \"as low as reasonably achievable\" as a\nmethod of risk mitigation. For return to flight after Columbia, we have a very\nextensive guide, and the Space Operations Directorate has a very detailed return-\nto-flight plan. So, I think we're doing everything we can.\nDAVID LONGNECKER: Hi, David Longnecker from the University of Pennsylvania.\nAnd my question is probably addressed to you, John. And that is, following up on\nwhat we just heard about mitigating risk, one risk we haven't really talked about\nso far--at least [to] any significant degree here--is the risk associated with a\nvery large organization with multiple components, each doing their ob to an\noptimal level, but, yet, creating a series of stovepipes that are not linked together\nacross the organization. I'd be curious to know what NASA's doing to deal with\nthat sort of linkage of risk across a huge organization.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: David, that's a great question. Thank you for asking that,\nand I think you saw on August 1st that NASA engaged in a rather large-scale\ntransformation of its organization. The study of organizational risk in high-risk\nendeavors is a very mature study, but not very well understood. And you talked\nabout stovepipes. The function of the transformation was to get NASA aligned\nbehind a central goal. And you've heard that a lot. You have to have a clear goal.\nEverybody has to understand that goal, and everybody has to work together for\nthat goal. In the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report, they talked about\nintegration functions. And, so, one of the things that we've done is to strengthen,\nthrough consolidation and through this transformation, our ability to integrate.\nWe have a Science Missions Directorate that now contains all of our science\nand has close ties with exploration systems, space operations, aeronautics; and\nwe have an associate deputy administrator for integration who is the corporate\nconscience. And we develop our processes and policies to make sure that we\nhave close integration between all these endeavors, whether it's the expendable\nlaunch vehicles in the science arena or human spaceflight and the exploration\ndevelopment. And part of that--and, I think, a key part of that--is so that we\ncan incorporate lessons learned across the Agency into programs where those\nlessons may apply.\nSo, you know, that's not a full answer to your question, because it's only\nbeen a couple of months, but we're on the road towards trying to get that kind of\nintegration and breaking down the stovepipes.\nMITCH BARNEY: Mitch Barney, Goddard Space Flight Center. Ever since I was a\ncollege student, I've done my explorations in a bunny suit and clean-room booties.\n\nDISCUSSION\nSTEVE SQUYRES:\nthe\nan\nj\nI'm in the engineering side, developing new instrument-measurement techniques\nand technologies where failure is an option and the challenge is the risk--that's\nwhat brings you back day to day. Recently, the NASA environment for us has\nbecome a more competitive environment. We're competing and collaborating both\ninternally and externally with private industry and with academia. And I wonder\nwhat the panel's response [is] to a question about the impact of a competitive\nenvironment on the risk that NASA's taking now. Dr. Mather and Dr. Garvin, you\nboth mentioned the competitive aspects. So I wonder what you thought about\ncompetition and what it does--what's the impact on risk.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I'd like to start this, if I could, with Steve Squyres. I came to\nNASA as a principal investigator in science programs and considered that process\nto be like swimming with sharks. Yeah, Steve?\nIt is. I think that\ncompetitive process that we go\nthrough--if exercised appropriately, if the selection process is done in\nappropriate fashion--is one of the best risk mitigators that we have. My team,\nin various, different permutations and combinations, wrote three unsuccessful\nproposals--each of them, at the time, the best we could do, each of them with\nserious flaws--to agencies. We sent in the proposals. It was highly competitive.\nWe lost. It was painful. We went back and we sharpened our pencils and we did\na better ob. And each proposal got better and better and, finally, on the fourth\ntry, we managed to convince the Agency that something like MER was a good\nthing to do. I think that competitive process and the intensity of it--the pain\nand humiliation of losing a competition like that--drove us, and it drove us very\nhard to get better; and not just to write better proposals, but build safer, better,\nmore-likely-to-succeed hardware.\nAnd so, it's very important to have that competition. And I think the more\nbroadly the net is cast--opening up the competition to industry, to universities\nlarge and small, across the Agency--to try to level the playing field so that\neverybody's competing on roughly equivalent terms, is a very, very valuable\nthing. And I dislike the competitive process intensely, but it's part of what has\nled to success of many programs doing that.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think the key for us at NASA is to make sure we\nprovide you the tools and the ability to be able to compete head-to-head.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: If I may as well. I've seen the good and the bad of\nthe competitive process for, in particular, science-driven experiments. And we\nhaven't always gotten it right. I mean, Steve tells a good story, but we just spent\nthe last couple of years going through that competitive process for 25 wonderful\ncontests for missions to go to Mars, robotic missions, at this stage. And I think\nwe've actually achieved a risk-based lesson learned from honing of that process.\nAnd I first saw that process as a loser, often, in the '90s, proposing instruments,\nbut I later saw it from the standpoint of implementation, and I saw elegant things\nwe want to do in space--both at Earth and on planets--get through the process\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\non\nof\na\nwith great imagination and excitement, and then fail to sustain the cost envelope,\nthe research envelope.\nAnd I saw the community get smarter, that is, the integrated aerospace,\nuniversity, NASA center, you know, community. And in this last Mars scout\ngo-round--my one knothole in this--we had dozens of brilliant missions to\nMars. And in the end, the final four--I'm not a basketball player--emerged\nafter withering reviews by hundreds of individuals in which we spent more time\nworrying about being attentive to understanding risk. In fact, the most withering\nreview is the risk of implementation review we do. And I think, you know, to some\nextent, it's the setbacks that have honed that. So that I'm much more confident\nfrom all these analyses that we can do these things. Now, the question is, I think,\nhow do we maintain continuous improvement of that process when we reach a\ncertain level of performance--success from MER, success from COBE?\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I'm thinking that there are a lot of rules of the game that\ngovern how it all plays out and that at NASA Headquarters, when we set up the\nrules of engagement, we basically determine the outcome--in a way that we may\nnot anticipate--of how organizations grow or die. And the ability of organizations\nto grow or die as a response to the competitive process is part of capitalism, and\nit's part of the sort of basic religion of America, practically. But it does have some\nunintended consequences. Creative destruction is sort of [a] motto that people\ncarry, and a lot of us may lose. So, well, that's just part of the deal. And I think that\nwe need those competitive forces and, certainly, I've had a lot of losing proposals\nas well, so they know that and they deserve to lose, but maybe next time.\nSTEVE SQUYRES: There's one other aspect that we've mostly been doing with\nthe science side, because we're a science-heavy panel, but Jim brought up the\nmetrics by which you decide who wins the proposal. In the science case, we want\nprojects that are viable, scientifically top-notch, and so on. One of the duties of\nthe commander on a Space Shuttle flight--and I presume it was true of a Saturn\nV flight as well--is to remind the new fliers of the group that they're launching\nthe lowest bidder's successful project. So sometimes those measures\neffectiveness may be at odds with low risk.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: It must be getting late. Well, Jim, let me pick on you for a\nminute and ask you something. You've flown\nShuttle experiment, and I've\nthought about this. My Ph.D. thesis was on a Space Shuttle. It was on the Space\nShuttle Challenger, the flight before the fateful one, and I didn't think about the risk\nelement to the crew at all. When you flew your laser experiment, did you think at\nall about the risk the crew was taking to get science for you and your colleagues?\nJIM GARVIN: Well, in fact, John, we did, and for two reasons: One was the risk\nthat we were afraid we were imposing on them. We had 45 millijoules, the number\nin laser metrics, a non-eye-safe, infrared laser transmitter. The light could have\nblinded the crew looking out the back window. And so we developed flight rules\nand procedures with the crew so that they would be sleeping, often, when we\n\nDISCUSSION\n■\nBack to Contents page\nOpen next section\noperated. For two reasons: We didn't want them moving around, because we were\ntrying to measure little things on there, and, second, we didn't want that risk.\nBut I remember vividly the launch of STS-72, which was in January of '96, and\nthe biggest snowstorm in a decade in Washington[, DC].\nAnd I remember thinking that the crew were launching, you know, not\nreally thinking about the weather or getting to the payload operation control\ncenter at Goddard where they were running the experiment, which was causing\nme great stress, but I thought, they were riding these seven million pounds of\nthrust to carry our team's hundred kilos of stuff to try out an idea. And I thought\nhow lucky we were. Because we had all the infrastructure that got them there into\norbit successfully--in this case, it was a recovery mission for the Japanese--but\nalso, to let us have this window on the world with this flight. We went with\nchecked and set parameters, so I thought, if our straw is the one that breaks the\nback for the crew and, also for the mission and the Shuttle, that would be, you\nknow, a tremendous setback.\nWe were scheduled to have an experiment like this on the first Shuttle\nlaunch for science out of Vandenberg. So, we were to go into polar orbit with\nthe Shuttle to do experiments looking over the polar ice, being a big thing we\nwanted to measure. But, at any rate, it took us nine years to get back to our\nexperiment on Endeavour when we flew. I just think those are the challenges of\nhuman spaceflight.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I know, from the risk-taker's side, that the decision to\ngo is very easy when it's making great science or great exploration. That makes it a\nmuch easier discussion to think about the risks versus the rewards. There are folks\nI've flown with out here in the audience and we've done tremendous science.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: Any more? Going once, twice. Very good. Well, I want to\nthank all of the speakers. Let's give them all a great big hand. I also want to\ntake the time, once again, to thank the Naval Postgraduate School. It's been a\ntremendous venue for us and a great environment to have these discussions\ntoday for \"Sea and Stars.\" Also for Ames, which has helped facilitate this. Don't\nforget, tonight is dinner and a movie. We'll be watching the Endurance. And for\nthose out in the listening world, thanks for watching NASA TV.\n\nl\nS E S S I O N F O U R\nwhy we exp ore\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nWhy We Explore\nWelcome to \"Risk and Exploration--Earth, Sea, and the\nStars.\" Today's session is entitled \"Why We Explore,\" but I'm hoping that, mostly, we can\nmake it a dialogue, up close and personal. I'm John Grunsfeld. I'm the NASA chief scientist\nand an astronaut.\nI think we have started getting into the discussions on risk and exploration, into some\nof the thorny questions about how do we make decisions. How do we use our judgment?\nHow do we, as institutional managers of a public institution, make decisions on behalf of\nthe American people, and with oversight of the Congress, that can stand the test of time,\nwithout being so risk averse that we don't do anything interesting?\nThere's a couple of things I'd like to show this morning that are personal, that are\nprofessional as chief scientist, and then, representing the Agency, and then, looking forward.\nI think we'd be remiss in all of this discussion if we avoided the topic of why we're not\nsending a Space Shuttle back to the Hubble to service it. So I'll address that in a second.\nOne of our favorite cartoons shows a Conestoga wagon heading across the Great\nPlains. And the title reads \"Alarmed by the many dangers, the pioneers abandoned westward\nEndeavour on STS-67. In 1997, Grunsfeld\nAtlantis\nMir\noutside the Space Shuttle.\nld\ni\ni\ni\nAstronaut, astrophysicist, and mountaineer, John M. Grunsfeld served as NASA's chief scientist from\n2003-2004. Grunsfeld is a veteran of four Space Shuttle flights. In 1999 and 2002 he took part in a total\nof five successful spacewalks to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope.\nA native of Chicago, Grunsfeld received a bachelor's degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology in 1980. He earned a masters degree and a doctorate in physics from the University of\nChicago in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Grunsfeld was selected as a NASA astronaut in 1992. His first\nflight assignment came in 1995 on board the Space Shuttle\nserved as flight engineer for the Space Shuttle\nduring STS-81 and a 10-day mission to Russia's\nspace station. He has logged over 45 days in space, including 37 hours and 32 minutes working\nJohn Grunsfe\nNASA Ch ef Sc ent st and Astronaut\n\nexploration except for a series of unmanned prairie-probe vehicles.\" You know,\nI think many people have summed up succinctly why humans explore. Because\nwe want to go. In the face of danger, but managed risk. I am absolutely positive\nthat our outward expansion from the cradle that planet Earth is, will not be one\nof strictly unmanned probes, but we will be heading out across the prairies. Why\n[do] we explore? Right now, Spirit at Columbia Hills [Mars] is poised to look over\nthose hills and see what's beyond.\nI'm an explorer who is trained by a group called the National Outdoor\nLeadership School, and we're privileged to have John Gans, the director of the\nNational Outdoor Leadership School, here. I went there in high school and it was\nto learn to be a better risk manager, a better leader in the outdoors and, hopefully,\nnot to be reckless like most teenagers.\nBut my interest in exploration was largely driven through the pages of\nNational Geographic, through the movies of Jacques Cousteau, while growing up\non the south side of Chicago, that I was able to explore vicariously. But I wanted to\ngo. I have a passion for exploration, and I have a weakness. When I see something\nlike Columbia Hills, I have a need to look over that hill. And it's a real challenge.\nIt's a real challenge because you set limits for yourself. And as mountaineers,\nwe set limits for ourselves. We have to summit by a certain time so we can make\nit back safely. And I'm constantly torn, wanting to go further, especially when I'm\non professional travel and I take a day off to go hike. I say, \"Well, I only have one\nday and I'll go this far.\" And I get that far and I look forward and I say, \"Boy, I've\ngot to go a little further.\"\nSo, that's what we're doing with Spirit and Opportunity on Mars now. We\nhave the opportunity to go further because the rovers are still running, they're\nstill doing great. You know, we had a 90- or a 120-day mission and we're well\nbeyond that now, and we have hope they can go much further.\nThis May and June, I had the opportunity to try and climb a little hill in\nAlaska called Denali--Mt. McKinley. It's 6,157 meters, 20,320 feet tall. This is a\nserious expedition. It's not quite the kind of thing that Ed Viesturs does, but it's,\nI think, comparable in many ways.\nIt's at 63 degrees north latitude. That makes it perhaps the coldest mountain\non planet Earth. You start out already basically in the Arctic. Its conditions on the\nsummit are comparable to Everest in winter. The Alaska Range is a large landmass\nthat extends up out of plains, basically, a few hundred feet in altitude. It sees the\nfull brunt of arctic weather. And, so, it seemed like an appropriate challenge.\nNow, in order to do this as an astronaut--and I see Colonel Cabana in the\naudience--this was my third try. The first time I tried, as an astronaut, I felt\ncompelled to write a mission statement and a risk-mitigation statement that I\nsubmitted to my boss, Colonel Cabana, then chief of the astronaut office, so that\nI could get permission to go, so to speak. Even though it was personal leave.\nThat's the way I view risk management on this climb: you have my crew\nnotebook with checklists. And I think I'm the only mountaineer I know who\ngoes up with checklists and says, \"Okay.\" And part of that was, I recognized that\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAstronaut John M. Grunsfeld, mission\nspecialist, looks over a flight plan on\nSpace Shuttle Discovery's flight deck\nwhile communicating with ground\ncontrollers.\n(NASA Image # S103-E-5016)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nat high altitude I will be hypoxic, I will make mistakes. And this was one of\nmy mechanisms to prevent myself from making mistakes. I still made lots of\nmistakes. I think back now and I think, \"It's in the checklist; how could I have\nmissed it?\"\nBut it's one mechanism of risk mitigation that we use very often in the space\nbusiness, because the line between life and death is so fine. We heard in this talk\nsomething that I think is very characteristic: the farther you go from base camp,\nif the smiles get bigger, you have the right team. And we lived, basically, on a\nglacier for 23 days. All of our water came from melting snow.\nJust a great experience. No cell phones, no beepers, no Blackberrys, really\njust existing in a very primal way, but with the aid of high technology, and that's\nsomething I think is part of the real spirit of exploration, that trying to go to the\nnext hill. And I got up to the top and I looked back and I waved at Dave Schuman,\nwho is another NASA Headquarters employee. I said, \"Dave,\" and I had to yell.\nI said, \"Dave, I have bad news.\" And he was thinking \"Oh, no.\" We thought we\nwere close to the summit--we'd been on the summit ridge for about two hours\nclimbing up from something called the \"Football Field.\" And it's tedious. What\nEd Viesturs said is right. You take a step, you breathe a bunch of times, and you\ntake a step. And every time you stop to breathe, you look forward to see how\nmuch longer it is. And, very often, you don't see the top, you know, [you have\nto] climb another ridge. And I said, \"I have bad news. There's no place else to go\nbut down.\"\nI was actually worried about sort of an anticlimactic feeling. This was\nmy third try, and I just couldn't believe I was actually standing on the highest\npoint in North America--just an unbelievable feeling. I was half laughing-- my\nclimbing buddies say hysterically--and half crying. I just couldn't believe it. So\nwe had three NASA employees on the summit of North America on June 7th of\nthis year, 91 years after the first ascent.\nA lot of people have climbed to the top of this mountain--about 12,000.\nAbout one out of a hundred perish in this. My risk management plan was to\ngo through a book called Accidents in North American Mountaineering. It's\npublished every year. Just the fact that a book like this is published means that\nmountaineers are very sensitive to this issue of risk and that we try and learn\nfrom others' mistakes.\n\" \"\nI HAVE A PASSION FOR EXPLORATION, AND I HAVE A WEAKNESS.\nWHEN I SEE SOMETHING LIKE COLUMBIA HILLS, I HAVE A NEED TO\nLOOK OVER THAT HILL. AND IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE.\n\"\n\"\nJOHN GRUNSFELD\nWHY WE EXPLORE\n\nI went through basically every mountaineering accident on Mt. McKinley\nand in the Alaska Range from 1969 to about 1992 and came up with common\ncauses, behaviors that led to those accidents, and then asked myself, how can\nI avoid those behaviors? And, so, that was also in my little notebook. And I'd\nreview that every night and then review it with the team. \"Okay, we're not going\nto do this. We're always going to stay roped, no matter where we are. We're\nalways going to carry an ice axe.\"\nWe pretty much beat it away so that if you do the statistics, it became more\nlike 1 in 10,000. And one of the things that people think about mountaineering is\nthat it's high-risk behavior. In fact, a mountaineer who climbs recreationally, as I\ndo, is about three times more likely to die from heart disease in the United States\nthan from a mountaineering accident. But,\nof course, when there is a mountaineering\naccident, and a rescue, that short-term drama\nthat we discussed here is what plays big, and\nnot the many, many safe expeditions.\nThe other thing that we will talk about\nin the discussion is the Hubble decision.\nOn January 16th [2004], Sean O'Keefe, the\nAdministrator of NASA, Ed Weiler, and I\nwent out to the Goddard Space Flight Center\nto announce to the Hubbard Space Telescope\nservicing team that Mr. O'Keefe had made the\nhard decision that we were not going to return\nto the Hubble Space Telescope for a fifth\nservicing mission with the Space Shuttle.\nThis hit me extremely hard. I am\nliterally a \"Hubble Hugger,\" as I think many\nof you know. I've had the privilege of visiting\nthe Hubble Space Telescope twice. I'm a\nprofessional astronomer. I know Bob Parker\nis here somewhere, he's another astronomer\nastronaut, and I'm sure he can appreciate\nhow tough this was. But Mr. O'Keefe looked\nat all the elements post-Columbia, and, in\nfact, our last mission was on Columbia up to\nthe Hubble in March of 2002. And he looked\nat the recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.\nHubble has a clock, an internal clock. And that clock is driven by gyroscopes\nand batteries. And sometime in the next two to three years, the gyroscopes that\nare on Hubble will wear out, and Hubble won't be able to do science anymore.\nNot too much longer after that, the batteries will run out of juice, their ability\nto charge and recharge, and at that point, the telescope will go cold and won't be\nable to be recovered.\nAstronaut John M. Grunsfeld, positioned on a foot restraint on the end of Discovery's\nremote manipulator system (RMS), prepares to replace a radio transmitter in one of\nthe Hubble Space Telescope's electronics bay.\n(NASA Image # STS103-713-048)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nSo we have to get to Hubble before the batteries die. And if you look at the\nrecommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, and if you say\nwe're going to satisfy every single recommendation before we go to flight and you\nsay that we're not going to succumb to schedule pressure again, then when you look\nat the risk-to-benefit of using a Space Shuttle, you put yourself in a real box.\nOne of the boxes goes like the following: Imagine that we press forward with\na Hubble servicing mission with the Shuttle. We have the crew trained, we have\nthe big team trained, and we're on the pad. You know, maybe even we have liquid\noxygen boiling off and the hissing and the moaning. And, in the launch count, we\nfind out that something's not working right. A computer is down, a multiplexer\nisn't working, some communication link on the ground isn't working. Our flight\nrules would say, \"Don't launch.\"\nBut whoever is in the hot seat that day will feel enormous schedule\npressure to launch that mission anyway, because Hubble won't wait. We're all\nsuccess-oriented, that's what we drive to. And Mr. O'Keefe didn't want to put\nany manager in that position.\nWorse, when we go to the Hubble orbit, we launch due east. And, so, the only\nself-rescue capability we have--and that's another very important element in\nmountaineering or any outdoor adventure or going down in caves and, certainly,\nin the Antarctic--is limited to what you really have on the Shuttle. And, so, early\nin his analysis, he said if we're going to go to Hubble, we want to have a second\nSpace Shuttle available on the pad so that you could launch within less than 30\ndays, which is probably the maximum you could keep a Shuttle crew going in\norbit, in case of a Columbia-like accident. Well, imagine the enormous pressure\nif you had to execute that--of the second Shuttle to go rescue the crew.\nWould we do it? Of course we would. If we put ourselves in that position,\nwe would do everything we could to mount that rescue mission. And the same\nthing if the weather's not good, if something's wrong with that second Shuttle.\nAnd, I think, about half the time, there's some issue that delays us. We're getting\nbetter and better. I know two of my four missions have been delayed by a number\nof months. Many other missions have been delayed even as close to a few seconds\nprior to launch, when an engine will shut down for good reason, and we then\nrecycle to two or three months later.\nThat's not acceptable if we're doing a rescue mission, even if it is a best-effort\nrescue mission. So I think the managers would feel that extreme schedule pressure\nthat would put another crew at risk. So Mr. O'Keefe just felt that, as the top banana\nrisk manager for the Agency, he didn't want to put us in that position.\nThat's a tough call. We all love Hubble. Hubble does extremely important\nscience and is, perhaps, the most important scientific instrument ever created\nby humans. So this hit many of us hard, and it's that emotional side that makes\nrisk-analysis and decision-making so hard. Someone said that the decisions we\ndon't have control over are the ones that we worry the most about, and the ones\nwe do have control over, we worry the least about. Well, this is one that I know\nMr. O'Keefe has worried the most about.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD\nWHY WE EXPLORE\n\nAnd it really is compliance with all of the recommendations of the Columbia\nAccident Investigation Board and where we have raised the bar to make sure that\nwe fly safely with the Shuttle--as safely as we can.\nWhat we also heard in this conference [is] that the only limit is our\nimagination. Absolutely true. So the question you have to ask--and I did ask the\nAdministrator--\"Okay, if we can't go back with the Shuttle to service Hubble, how\ncan we service Hubble?\" I didn't quite put it that way, but I came back and said, \"If\nwe can service Hubble without the Shuttle, can we go forward with that?\"\nAnd I explained to him that it might be possible to use a robot to service\nHubble. Now, keep in mind that I'm proposing something that puts me, as a\nspacewalking astronaut, out of business. But that's exactly what we want to do.\nWe want to take routine operations of servicing--things that we can do with\nrobots, things that we pioneered using humans that now robotics can do--and\nreplace humans in hazardous situations.\nEVA, Extravehicular Activity, is a very hazardous activity. We've been very\nfortunate in our spacewalks and there have been some close calls. That being said,\nservicing Hubble robotically will be a true, high-performance challenge. So, it's\nnot clear that we can do it yet. But Mr. O'Keefe said we can go investigate that.\nThis was an idea that came out of the extremely talented team at the Goddard\nSpace Flight Center led by Frank Cepollina, one of our top inventors and out-\nof-the-box thinkers, a true explorer, one of the people responsible for the first\nservicing mission.\nRemember, Hubble was a \"space turkey,\" a \"dog in space,\" \"space junk.\" All\nof those things that we heard after it was launched, just because the mirror was\nground to the wrong shape. Now, it was actually the best mirror ever created, but\nit was the wrong shape. Well, we went up and put contact lenses on it, corrective\noptics, on the first servicing mission. And for three years, people [had] said, \"You\ncan't do it. People can't service it. It won't work. It will be too hard. You'll end up\ndestroying the telescope.\" But we did it.\nIt was that same team that came forward and said, \"We think we might be\nable to send robots to the rescue.\" Well, that alone wasn't quite enough to put\nus collectively over the edge to suggest that we actually should proceed with the\nrobotic mission, until we started listing the key technologies that we would have\nto prove to be able to service Hubble. And those technologies were: autonomous\nrobotic rendezvous with a spacecraft, proximity operations close to the telescope,\nreaching out and grabbing the telescope, effectively a docking; doing an assembly,\nputting a new spacecraft underneath the Hubble--robotic assembly, and then,\nhaving dexterous robotics, agile robotics that can feel, to be able to service the\ntelescope the way humans do, new tool development.\nWe looked at that list and I said, \"Boy, that list looks exactly like our top list\nof things we need to learn how to do to explore--to go to the Moon, Mars, and\nbeyond.\" And so the idea came up of using Hubble to be a catalyst for exploration.\nBecause, after all, what is Hubble? Hubble is out exploring the universe. It's\nour eyes for exploring the universe. It already is doing our exploration mission.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nAnd what a great part of the Hubble story that it can continue to do science and\nbe that spark that allows us to go further on.\nHubble is very hard to work on. This is going to be pushing what we've\ndone in space, you know, maybe one or two generations. But people perform at\ntheir highest when we give them high-performance challenges.\nIf you ask people the easy things, they'll do it, but when you ask people\nwho are passionate to do something hard, they'll do it well, and they'll pull out\nall the stops. And we've heard that in all of our panelists and in contributions\nfrom the audience.\nOnce we installed the Advanced Camera for Surveys in the telescope,\nthere are a lot of very delicate operations. One of the good things about a robot\nis once its done the operation once, it can repeat it over and over again. And\nwe have a greater knowledge of the metrology--of all of the measurements of\nHubble--than any spacecraft ever, due to four servicing missions and all of the\nmetrology we did on the ground--all of the measurements we made. So that we\ncould build instruments on the ground while Hubble's in space and know that\nthey'll fit. So this is the best setup we're probably going to have to try some of\nthese hard things.\nThe proposed robotic servicing mission will launch on an expendable\nvehicle. We've got to get it up there sometime around late 2007 or 2008, so\nthose of you who've heard about the MER, you know, 34 months wasn't long\nenough; well, we have about the same amount of time. It'll have two parts. It'll\nhave a part that's going to stay with the telescope and one that will leave. Once\nit's on orbit, a robotic arm, much like the Space Shuttle, will be deployed. And\nthere'll be people involved--this is not a push a button and it goes. Folks on the\nground will be monitoring this and, maybe, controlling it.\nWe're going to grab Hubble in exactly the same way we did with the Shuttle.\nWe'll have the same end effector--a very similar arm, a similar approach--and\nwe'll use the same spots on the Hubble that we grab with the Shuttle. So, we're\nstill in known territory, we're just using a robot. The robot will then put itself\non the bottom. And that's exactly what we do with the Shuttle--we grab Hubble\nand we put the Shuttle underneath. And we latch with these exact same latches.\nWell, now the robot's doing it.\nOnce we let go, now we have to get the arms and the hands. To do that,\nwe're going to use this special-purpose dexterous manipulator. It's already\nflight-ready. It's a Canadian arm called \"Dextre\"--that's the call sign. And it was\nbuilt to service electronics on the International Space Station.\nWell, we're going to steal that first and use it on Hubble. It'll deploy some\ncables to hook up the new spacecraft into the Hubble. This is something we\nfeel comfortable doing, except for the part with the connectors. The connectors\nare always tricky--they're tricky for people with hands, especially when you're\nwearing these big space gloves. In two weeks, we built prototype tools that were\nable to take these connectors on the ground-based version on and off. And so\nwe're reasonably confident we'll be able to do this.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD\nWHY WE EXPLORE\n\nBut of course, we have to expect the unexpected, and Hubble always\nprovides unexpected surprises. So we're going to involve all of the spacewalking\nastronauts and folks who have controlled robots on Hubble to go through all of\nthese and think what could go wrong, and make sure we have the robot designed\nto do that.\nNext, we're going to take out the wide-field camera. There's just two bolts\nand a ground strap and it pulls out externally. And we're going to stow the old\none and put a new one in. The nice thing is, once we've taken it out, the robot\nnow knows every motion it takes to put the new one back in. And we'll have extra\ncameras. One of the things about this robot is it can actually feel force. We'll have\nmonitoring so that if it hits something, we see the force on that particular joint\nrising, and we can back off a little bit and change the attitude.\nWe also have to hook the new spacecraft into the brains of Hubble. That'll\nbe another connector. It will be on the computer that Mike Foale put in. There's a\nconnector on the top, fortunately, not on the side, that's just a shorting plug. So,\ntake it off and put a cable on and then close the door on the cable.\nNow we get into the really hard stuff, which is to take the corrective optics\nout. They are not needed anymore. All new instruments have the corrective\noptics built in. These are the sides of the refrigerator, so this is doing the job\nof Jim Newman, who had that advance camera and put in the Cosmic Origins\nSpectrograph. Once that's done, the servicing part goes away. Hubble, hopefully,\nwill get between three and eight years of extended life, and then, at the end of\nlife, we have to safely deorbit Hubble. Again, it's a safety and a risk issue. There\nis about a 1:250 chance that some large part of Hubble will survive to the ground\nin a populated area, and that risk is just too high.\nSo that little package on the bottom that has the new batteries in it also has\ndeorbit engines. So Hubble will deploy all of its booms, start charging up the new\nbatteries, do its science, and then sometime, perhaps as late as 2015, we'll feather\nthe arrays, much like Mike Melvill feathered the wings on SpaceShipOne, and fire\nthe deorbit module.\nI'm hoping to be on a cruise ship somewhere in the Pacific to watch Hubble\nfly over and reenter. I think we'll all have to have a big party and really celebrate\nan incredible voyage. It will be this voyage that will have helped stimulate and\nadvance us, probably by five or six years, in the exploration effort.\nSo that's the plan for the robotics. We actually have some contracts in place\nnow. I think it was last Friday we announced that Lockheed Martin had won\nthe contract to build part of the spacecraft. It is going to be assembled at the\nGoddard Space Flight Center as an in-house project. People say three years is\nimpossible. But the really good news is that we have a tremendous amount of\nhardware already built, because we were on the road to a Servicing Mission 4.\nHubble has produced great images. How many people have seen the Hubble\nDeep Field? Or the Ultra Deep Field? An amazing picture. A thousand galaxies. It\ntook 11 days staring into a blank part of space. If you hold a soda straw up to the\nsky at night and look through it, that's about the area of the picture. If you look at\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nwhat's in the background in this relatively short exposure with this new camera,\nyou see a lot of things. If you add up all of the spots, each of which is another\ngalaxy, there are six thousand galaxies. Remember, that's just a little soda straw\nwith a relatively short exposure. Each one of those galaxies has 100 to 200 billion\nstars. You heard me say yesterday, 10 years ago we didn't know about any other\nplanets outside of our own solar system. Now we know, in just the nearby stars,\nof over 125. There are about twice that many that are being investigated to be\nconfirmed. We now think planetary systems are common. So you can add it up\njust in this picture alone: 6 thousand times 200 billion times a couple of planets\nper star. There are a lot of planets out there. It's pretty mind-boggling.\nThat's where we're going on Hubble. Where are we going next with the\nSpace Shuttle? Well, we're going back to the Space Station. In the President's\nvision for space exploration, our first task is to return the Shuttle safely to flight.\nThe team is working through that. They are working through it with a passion as\nwell. It is also hard.\nWe are finding a lot of challenges, not the least of which is we don't really\nhave a Shuttle we can launch to test the new foam changes. So, we have our best\nand brightest engineers working on it. We have Admiral Cantrell helping us with\nthe safety issues. We have really pulled out all the stops.\nThe crew that is going to go is led by Eileen Collins and piloted by Jim Kelly,\nboth very experienced. I flew with Wendy Lawrence on my first mission. She's\nan incredibly hard worker, intense and talented, from the United States Navy.\nCharlie Camarda, Andy Thomas, Steve Robinson, Soichi Noguchi from JAXA,\nthe Japanese Space Agency. A really exciting crew. We are going to dock with the\nSpace Station. We are going to evaluate our techniques for inspecting the orbiter\nand for repairing the orbiter with some EVA flight tests.\nThe crew patch [referencing presentation slide] has the crew names around\nthe outside and on the orbit. It has this swoosh and the STS-107 outline from\ntheir crew patch in recognition of that crew.\nBefore you leave today, we have STS-114 pins for every one of you. I want\nyou to wear those as a reminder of this conference and the work we have ahead of\nus. There are going to be hundreds of risk decisions, reward considerations, and\njudgments that we are going to make before we return to flight.\nI hope today is the start of a dialogue that you all have with us and that\nwe have with you, and that you will take with you to the groups with whom\nyou work, whether it's within NASA or outside of NASA. To continue this\n\" \"\nI HOPE TODAY IS THE START OF A DIALOGUE THAT YOU ALL HAVE\nWITH US AND THAT WE HAVE WITH YOU, . . .\n\" \"\nJOHN GRUNSFELD\nWHY WE EXPLORE\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\ndiscussion, either as organizations or as smaller groups or as individuals, we can\ncome back and keep this an ongoing dialogue. I think this continuing dialogue\nis very important if we are going to minimize the risk and maximize the return\nin our endeavors. STS-114 is part of that dialogue, and you will all be part of it\nnow--those of you within NASA, by definition, and those outside--because of\nyour participation here. We thank you for that.\nAs [NASA] Chief Scientist, I get to spend a little time in the House Science\nCommittee room in Congress, probably more than I'd like. There are some things\nwritten on the wall that I think are really fantastic, and every time I sit there,\nthinking, What am I gonna say? or What are they gonna ask me?, I look up on the\nwall and read, \"For I dipped into the Future, far as human eye could see; saw the\nvision of [new] worlds, and all the wonder that would be.\" That's from Tennyson.\nAgain, this is something that I think drives us all.\n■\nBack to Contents page\n\nDiscussion\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: With that, I would like to really open the floor completely to any\ndiscussion we might have, to talk about some of the overarching themes that came out of\nthis meeting, anything we haven't covered. I want this to be very personal, and if folks don't\nask questions, and even if they do, I'm going to ask folks that haven't participated yet to\nvolunteer. In fact, let me try and stimulate that a little bit.\nWhy don't I ask our moderators if I can put them on the spot: Dave Halpern, Chris\nMcKay, and our dinner speaker, Mike Foale, put you on the spot. We'll just start talking a\nlittle bit.\nI think it was clear to me that there was general agreement that the greatest risk is not\nto explore at all. I think that is something that we have to communicate to folks. That we\nshould not get so risk-averse that we just don't go out and explore. I have covered this one,\nbut also the greatest risk is the lack of imagination. There are a lot of \"greatest risks.\" They\nare all up there as the pinnacle of greatest risks. I had written down in my notes: Always\nexpect the unexpected. Just like being asked to come down and talk. The other one, which I\nreally liked, was Miles O'Brien saying, \"The public is not as wimpy as we think.\"I can see no\ngreater example of the public flying a new space ship than SpaceShipOne this morning.\nLast year in the United States, about 40,000 people died in car accidents, of which\n22,000 were not wearing seatbelts. I call that stupid. Folks who do that aren't thinking\nabout the risk and consequence. In exploration, it is harder than that. Mike Melvill, on his\nfirst flight, and, as far as I know, on this flight, had no pressure suit. When you get above\n50,000 feet, the remaining atmospheric pressure is such that the partial pressure of carbon\ndioxide and water vapor in your lungs dominates, and oxygen cannot get into your blood.\nWater at body temperature at low pressures will start spontaneously boiling if you expose\nit to a vacuum.\nMike Melvill had no pressure suit. That's hanging it out. Why? Why wasn't he wearing\na seatbelt and a pressure suit? Well, performance. They are at the edge of the performance\nof what we can do with a vehicle like that, and that's the decision they made to take that\nrisk. It paid off.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n(NASA Image # S98-04118)\nOPENING PHOTO:\nCommander Yuri Usachev (left) from\nRussia and U.S. astronauts Susan Helms\nand Jim Voss participate in Soyuz winter\nsurvival training in March 1998 near Star\nCity, Russia. The three became members\nof the second crew to live aboard the\nInternational Space Station.\nThey have a very, very good safety program. They look at all of the consider-\nations, and they consider their pressure vessel to be one that can't fail, at least given\nthe risks that they are willing to take at this stage. So they are true pioneers.\nIn aviation, so many pilots died early on. As a result of that, we developed\nlots of the safety mechanisms that test pilots like Mike Melvill use to fly in\nSpaceShipOne. This risk-judgment-benefit is really tough stuff, and I think it's\ngreat when it succeeds. We need to keep pushing.\nMiles also said, \"Exploration is driven by fear, greed and curiosity.\" I like to\nstay on the curiosity end of things. Focus on the target. Get the right target. Have\nan overarching shared goal. It is just wonderful now that NASA has that in the\nvision for space exploration. We need to keep focusing on that. The other thing\nthat I thought was interesting is that 96 percent of the energy content of the\nuniverse is in stuff that we have absolutely no clue what it is. I think that's great.\nWhat I didn't know is 96 percent of the undersea environment has not\nbeen explored. Folks say the easy targets have been explored, and it gets much\nharder from here. Largely, that's true. Technology is no substitute for experience\nand leadership.\nI am going to put Mike Foale on the spot right away, because I've talked\na little bit about NOLS [National Outdoor Leadership School], and technology\nis no substitute for experience and leadership. Mike, in the Astronaut Corps\nnow we are doing some things to try and enhance our expedition leadership.\nMaybe you can talk about just a couple of those things, like the NOLS, like the\nNEEMO [NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations], and let folks know\nwhat we're doing.\nMICHAEL FOALE: Well, John, I covered a bit of that in my dinner talk. To carry\nout any technologically advanced exploration mission which involves complicated\ntechniques and new equipment, you have to be trained. You have to know how to\nuse your equipment. If you take really fancy gear with you and you don't know\nhow to use it and you waste time on it in a blizzard or on top of a mountain, you\nmay actually end up risking more by messing with it than leaving it behind.\nWhen we train, we are basically putting aside that risk. We are mitigating the\nrisk of carrying out the mission when we actually, finally, get to space. With\nastronaut training, just as the training we heard about going under the sea or\ninto the deep caves, certainly you train for mountain climbing, we try and train\nso that we will perform better once we are there.\nHowever, the training is not necessarily without risk. The training is not\nnecessarily in the simulator, where I think you're pretty safe, unless a brown\nrecluse bites you, which happened with Joe Engle once. Some of our training\ninvolves going outdoors. Some of it involves flying in aircraft that could have a\nmalfunction, in particular, as we look toward exploration beyond Earth orbit, and\nin particular, when we can't turn around. Think of the Apollo 13 example, when\nyour problem occurs on the way out to your destination, or where you are forced\nto go a long way out before you get to come back, then you are in a situation of\nsurvival or making the best of all the materials and resources at hand.\n\nDISCUSSION\nsize\nthen\nWe have started to develop training that will take astronauts in small\ngroups, crew\nroughly. Six is what we've been choosing. We are\nworking with the National Outdoor Leadership School for one, the Canadian\ngovernment for another, and the NEEMO group in Key Largo, Florida, to explore\nand develop leadership, followership, and self-management skills in our crews.\nThat is one task.\nSecond, we are starting to get a feel for what we need to do when we are\nisolated and when we are dependent only on each other and the things we have\nat hand. That training we are still in the process of discussing and inventing.\nI showed you three cases. One is the National Outdoor Leadership School,\nwhere we go out either into the Canyon lands or into a mountain environment.\nAnother one has been exercises. We have taken part actually starting off in Cold\nLake, Canada, where basically we are given a scenario more of \"expeditioning\"\nfrom one point to another. It is kind of a fancy series of walking through the snow,\nmanaging yourselves, looking after your team, and managing the equipment that\nyou have with you. It is led by instructors who already have a plan on what the\nexercise is going to be, and it is covered in terms of risk, because we also have\nthe full resources of the Canadian Armed Forces to get us out of there if we\nactually got seriously hurt.\nAnother analogue that we have been exploring and using is the Aquarius\nLaboratory in Key Largo, Florida. There we've put together crews that are three\nastronauts with three nonastronauts. We have actually included our Mission\nControl flight leads, who would normally be in the Control Center controlling\na mission, to take part in those dives and those missions. And there we have\nactually solved another issue which is the classic problem of \"What on Earth is\nground control thinking!\" when you get these strange instructions. Especially\nif you actually have people who have a stake in your activities. Scientists who\nare not in the team but [are] back at home in safe conditions will be asking\nthings of you that might be rather difficult or seem rather strange or irrelevant\nat that point in your difficulties. And we're trying to bring together the Mission\nControl teams with the astronaut teams that would be deployed so that they\nwould see each other's problems. And we've done that two or three times now.\nLooking to the future, as we plan for moving to the Moon first and then Mars,\nwe need to develop further the idea of being able to maintain our equipment, look\nafter those resources that we have, even if they break and are a long, long time\naway from any kind of refurbishment back on Earth. To that extent, we want to\nactually follow-up on some of the Apollo lessons that we saw to teach geology at\nfirst. And these were in the deserts, I think always in the United States. Because\nof the Martian meteorite interest now, it's very exciting. We have thought about\nattempting expeditions, taking part with other scientific expeditions where there\nis a scientific goal that we, the astronaut office, do not have a stake in but they\nhave a stake in our performance. So, that would be realistic and an analogue to a\nreal mission on Mars or the Moon, where we have to carry out some of the grunt\nwork--the deployed work--that would be required.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\na\nWe are also looking at going to hot deserts, where meteorites also occur.\nThis would combine the expedition training with acquiring field geology skills\nthat would also be required of a small group going to the Moon or Mars. I think\nthat summarizes it.\nI should just add, once we get to these deployed situations, there are risks.\nAnd I myself was a little perplexed a number of years ago, when I was asked to come\nup with the whole safety/risk mitigation plan. And I had to have a safety review of\nwhat we were talking about and planning. At that time, we were sending roughly six\nastronauts at a time for survival training in Russia. And at that time, I talked about\nneeding to have some insight into the other partner's processes. The same would go\nfor the Canadians. The same would go if we hire another group, such as NOLS, for\nexample. NASA has to know what you do when we use your services.\nWith Russia, they had had\nnumber of helicopter accidents, and the\ntraining we were proposing was to do some of those search and rescue exercises\nwith the Russian helicopters. And in the end, people were so just alarmed by the\nstories coming out of Russia we had to turn that off. I didn't know how to fill out\na kind of safety/risk plan or matrix on that. Sometimes, you just have to use good\njudgment. You use your intuition. You ask all the questions that you can. We heard\nhow James Cameron manages his film set. That was interesting to me, because he\ndoesn't have the formal process that NASA has in its bureaucracy, forced on as a\nresult of many, many mishaps over many, many years of experience. Sometimes,\nin smaller groups, you have to use judgment. And I think we are going to be in a\nposition of having to use our judgment as we assess some of these new activities,\nnot only just processes and safety reviews.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: One of the things that you brought up was working with our\ninternational partners. That, I'm sure, is going to be a major issue with pushing\nout beyond lower Earth orbit to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. And it happens on\nEarth frequently, the issue of different international cultures. And we heard a little\nbit of that. I think that's one we're really going to have to grapple with. Not just the\nday-to-day living types of things, but how different cultures deal with the safety\nissue. Whether it's documented or whether it's trusting people's good judgment.\nMIKE FOALE: I know Chris, and certainly others from Ames who have been doing\nresearch, they've had to work, in particular, with Russians. And I know James\nCameron did. I'd love to know what their opinions are and how they manage\ninsight into systems that they don't know all about.\nCHRIS MCKAY: It's difficult, and in Russia, in particular helicopters flights--flying\nwith the U.S. Navy in Antarctica is very different than flying with Aeroflot in\nSiberia. And we'd like to take you on both trips, Mike. Actually, we would like to\nget you into the ice-covered lakes. I think you and Dale and I ought to talk after.\nBut, actually, what I would like to do is come back to this conference and just\nthink about it a little bit. It's been an incredibly fun and interesting conference.\nI can't remember when I've enjoyed one as much. My question to the audience\nis, how do we make it a useful conference? How do we take what we stated here\n\nDISCUSSION\nQUESTION:\nand make it something that could be useful--and I would say, useful to whom?\nUseful to three parts of NASA. The robotics program, which, after we heard Steve\nSquyres talk, I think is clearly in need of a better risk assessment strategy. The\nnear-term human program, which we're hearing about. I think John, Mike, and\nothers are well involved in that, and I think that's been in the impetus for this\nconference. And I applaud them for their efforts. And I think that's the light that\nmakes a way of doing something useful possible, [your] attention to this. And,\nthen, third is, [as] Mike was just saying, long-term human exploration of distant\nplanets--which is going to be a completely different category of risk and danger.\nSo, how do we make this conference useful to the robotic program, to the near-\nterm human program, and to the long-term exploration program?\nAnd I know that there are a lot of people in the audience with a lot of good\nideas about this, because I would hear them, as I was scarfing down my dessert\nat the dinners and lunches. And I think it would be good to get a dialogue going.\nHow do we make this conference useful, rather than just all going home and\nhaving had a fun and interesting time?\nAndy Presby. I'm student here at the school. I'm glad you asked . . .\nThe sign on the wall there behind you says, why do we explore? And I think I've\nheard a lot of very inspiring and interesting stories over the last couple of days\nabout why individual people--panelists and people in the room--have chosen\nto explore. And a lot of them are the same reasons that NASA has inspired me\npretty much since I was born, since I can remember. But I think an important\nthing for you guys to realize is that the first thing that struck me is [that] not all\nof you explore for the same reasons. And when you're looking at NASA from the\noutside in--and I think some of the folks from Hollywood and the media have\nidentified it correctly--the public is not as concerned about risk maybe as the\nexplorers are. The public seems to have sort of understood that you guys accept\nthe risk and you do it because you love it, for whatever reasons.\nWhat the public is worried about is, why are we going? And why should\nI pay for what you love to do? Why is it helpful to me to pay for what you love\nto do? And I think that if you guys walk out of here with anything, perhaps a\nuseful thing would be an internal dialogue amongst yourself culminating in an\nintensified outreach program to explain to the public, in terms that they can\nunderstand clearly, why they should pay for what we all in this room, I think,\nwould agree is one of the most important things our government does for us in\nthis country.\nMICHAEL FOALE: I think we heard very eloquent expressions over the last\nthree days as to why we explore. I'm actually more worried about the public not\nperceiving when it's dangerous. I don't believe people expected the Columbia\naccident. Astronauts do expect the Columbia accident. And I think there are\nmisconceptions out there. Someone referred to it. It's the repetition of anything\nthat makes us numb to the risks. And because we've seen Space Shuttles launch\nand land successfully a number of times, it was a surprise.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nthe\nQUESTION:\nThe risk has not been well communicated. What SpaceShipOne did today\nwas extraordinary. And you saw, if you were watching, how something very\nunexpected happened during the ascent. The Space Shuttle goes--there's 25\ntimes more energy in that whole business. I mean it's 100 tons, is it? Take the\nspeed, divide by 25, and square it, you're going to get the answer.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: It's 25 squared over 3 squared. [laughter] We're two\nphysicists. We'll have this in a moment.\nMICHAEL FOALE: So if it's Mach 3, and we go Mach 25 in a Space Shuttle, divide\n3 by 25 and you get about 8. And then you square it, and it's 64. But it's huge.\nThe difference is that their heating on entry is just going above boiling--if that.\nIt's not anywhere near risking a metal hull. If it's a composite hull, it's going to\nstart risking it pretty soon.\nA space vehicle gets up to 2,000-3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. So these issues\nare engineering issues, they're mundane, they're arcane to the public, who don't\nreally care to hear the details. But the final answer is that it's dangerous. It's risky\nif any of these things fail.\nJohn brought up an interesting comment about the risk of this launch\ntoday, which I would like to get to, to tell you that there is risk here even in\nSpaceShipOne. He talked about the lack of a pressure suit. He talked about the\nneed for closing the hatch and living only in shirtsleeves there. We don't do much\ndifferent on the Space Shuttle. We have pressure suits, and we have parachutes.\nThey didn't do the Columbia crew any good. I don't know they would have done\nChallenger crew any good.\nSo the situation really isn't so different. And, yet, John pointed to the risk\nthis morning for Mike Melvill as he did that climb. The risk is still there for\nevery Shuttle astronaut that will be flying on the Space Shuttle henceforth.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I was trying to use the seatbelt analogy. It doesn't guarantee\nit. But it reduces the risk. Good point.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Why does the public think then, that NASA is going to make it\nrisk free? There is the perception that if we were disciplined, if we followed the\nColumbia accident report rules, and if we had a culture of safety, we would be risk\nfree. Somehow the message that you guys are saying, which is that it is inherently\nrisky, people are going to die, crashes are going to occur, is not being conveyed by\nNASA. We're not getting across the message that you're articulating.\nAnd that's what I'm saying is, how do we turn this conference into something\nuseful? Well, maybe we need to start figuring out how to get that message across,\nand stop giving the impression that we can make perfect systems.\nTom Krause, BST. We're involved in assisting with the culture\nchange effort at NASA. It seems to me that the issue is not so much that the\npublic doesn't recognize the risk, but rather that the public finds unacceptable\nthe possibility that something could have gone wrong organizationally that led to\nthe accident. So, when the investigation finds that errors and mistakes were made\n\nDISCUSSION\nthat could have been prevented, then it seems to me the public says, something\nabout this just isn't right.\nCHRIS MCKAY: Can I react to that for just a bit? If you take just about any\naccident and trace it back, you can find a step or a place where it could have been\nprevented. That's just the nature of these complex systems. And I don't think\nthat you'll ever be able to come up with an institution, a large group or even\na small group, where your accidents due to human factors or human error are\ngone. I think that's unrealistic. And maybe Scott, who is on the Board, we might\nput him on the spot here, since I think he works at the same Center I do, could\ncomment on it.\nSCOTT HUBBARD: Yeah, let me see if I can parse a little bit from where you're\ncoming from, and what he's saying. It took a long time to be sure we had the\nphysical part [about the Columbia accident], in the end we got that with no\nequivocation. Everybody absolutely knew that. The organizational part took a\nlot longer, or took a different approach, and was in many ways more complex to\nunderstand. And, I think, having people come in and talk to us, having members\nof the community as well as experts in behavior and complex systems and human\nfactors talk to us, the distinction was that we had, perhaps, led the public to\nbelieve that we had done everything we could reasonably do. And, in fact, as we\npeel the onion on the accident, we found that there were cases where, because\nof repetition of something that started off as an inflight anomaly and became\na turn around issue, because of other situations where people had fallen into\npoor habits of engineering analysis and so forth, we really did make some human\nerrors that, with a different type of approach to it possibly, could be addressed.\nAnd, in fact, that's the result of the culture change.\nSo, now what we have to do, I think, is to tell the public that there is a\nlevel of risk. That we are doing everything we can to mitigate that risk, but it is\nnot going to go away past a certain point, there aren't perfect systems. We are\ngoing to address the culture issues as much as possible, but there is going to be\nan irreducible residue in there that you're going to have to deal with. I think the\ndanger is that, with the talented people in this room, and the Astronaut Corps\nin particular, you make it look so easy. All the thousands of people that support,\nwith all the things that are done, the impression comes across--whether it's\nin the robotic program, with the perfect landings of Spirit and Opportunity, or\nwhether it's with the Shuttle program with, by all accounts, a perfect takeoff and\nlanding--that we've got it down.\nThe fact is that anybody who has participated in a launch, particularly if\nyou've been in the position of being the last person to say go, and you hear in the\nbackground, through your earphones, all the thousands of things that have to be\nright, all the systems that have to be polled, you know that there is an irreducible\nrisk of something catastrophic happening.\nWe do not tell the public that story. I think if the public just had the\nearphones on of the guy in the polling chain as you're getting ready to launch\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\"\nJOHN GRUNSFELD:\nas it\nrisk\nand was aware of all the people at all of the systems and all of the things that have\nto happen, they would immediately realize, gee, what we have to go through to\nmake this happen, it's truly extraordinary. So, I think that that's part of what we\nneed to communicate, and part of what this business is all about.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: Let me put John Gans on the spot. He's the director of\nthe National Outdoor Leadership School. They have thousands of students every\nyear who go out into the wilderness, go out into risky situations. I imagine\noccasionally a parent will call and say, my son or daughter is going to go out and\ndo this rock climbing, is it safe? And how do you communicate to them the risk\nelement as an institutional risk manager?\nJOHN GANS: Well, first off, we try and be as clear as possible that we can't\nguarantee anyone's safety, and we're up front about that. I think every time I\nget on United Airlines and I hear, you know, \"Safety is our number one priority,\nit runs through my mind that, no, getting us there is the number one priority.\nSafety may be number two. But say safety is number one, we wouldn't take off.\nIt's clear that profitability is not number one.\nJOHN GANS: So we try and be as clear as possible. And you mentioned the\nparent-child thing. I'm going to switch the question some, because Dr. Sylvia\nEarle talked about the role of education as it relates to exploration and risk\nmanagement and getting people outside and other things. And I think the\ninteresting thing that I have been thinking about in this conference is that my\ndaughter, this summer, started climbing in a more aggressive way. Safely, but in\na more aggressive way. My daughter was 10 this summer, and she wanted to get\nready to climb Devil's Tower with me this fall.\nI adore my daughter, you can probably tell. And it really hit me that, suddenly,\nI'm on the other end of this, and I'm hesitant about what she was going to do.\nNow, climbing has been one of my passions in life. That's where I've felt most\nalive. It's where I've had some of my best relationships with people around me,\nwith the world around me, and the environment around me. And, suddenly, was\nit okay for my daughter to do it when it moved beyond the walk-up situation into\nsomething that was more serious? And I came to terms with it. We are going up\nto Devil's Tower in October.\nBut there is something about generational passing\nrelates to\nmanagement. And we certainly run into it with parents making decisions for their\nchildren. It certainly is tied into the educational issue. But it's something that goes\nto each individual family, and it's something that I've thought a lot about over\nthe last few days. It's something that goes to the space program, the generational\ndifference between the people that grew up with Apollo, the generational difference\nnow. Look at the number of parents now that won't let kids go off and ride a bike\nalone, wander out of their neighborhood alone, whatever else is the case.\nI realize I'm broadening the issue far beyond NASA here, but it goes so far\nbeyond what we're talking about here, and, somehow, I think there is a role to play\n\nDISCUSSION\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:\nj\nQUESTION:\nfor our society in making the parent-child relationship understand risk better. And\nthere is a role there for our schools. So, now that I blew up your question totally\ninto something else, I'll pass off the mike and not go on further. But the long and\nshort of it is, we try and be very clear with parents that we can't guarantee any\nsafety out there, but we manage it very well, and then we convey the benefits. And\nwe know the benefits right down the list, and we rock at all those benefits, and are\nclear about them, much the same conversation that's gone on here.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: That's great, and it brings up another point, that you\nbrought out, which is, if you think about the early part of the space program,\nprior to the first American going into space, rockets generally blew up. Most\nrockets blew up while we were trying this.\nThey still do, John.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: They still do. Not most. Some. Let me just take this a little\nfurther, which is, when Michael and I were growing up, that's what we saw. We\nsaw the struggles, there was no question that it was risky. And as we started\nflying more, and then we built a spaceship that looks like an airplane, it brought\nit into everybody's daily experience. Then, people who are growing up now, like\nmy children, space is part of their culture. It's become the norm. And so people\ndon't really notice the space program now until we don't have one. And I think\nthat's an indication that it is part of our culture, and that the education can help.\nGo on, Mike.\nMICHAEL FOALE: I just want to add that people in this room are probably aware\nthat . . . I don't know of any rocket system that can launch 1,000 times and not\nhave an accident. Most rocket systems launch 100 times and have an accident.\nSo if that is the only way, if you're on the rocket on the 100th time, and you do\na lot of trials, and you do the statistics, that's [it], you die on that rocket. So the\nway you get better than one in a hundred on any rocket system is to have a way\nof surviving that explosion that 100th time. And the Russians have done quite a\ngood ob with the Soyuz escape system, it's worked twice in all of their launches,\nhundreds of launches. Apollo was a good system never used. I think Gemini has\nan interesting case. It's a story as to why they didn't have an escape system quite\nlike the Mercury before it.\nBut that is the way we get away from those--the fact today is that rockets\ndo still blow up, and we can't do anything about it right now. We don't have a\nstrange, wonderful, anti-gravity technology that will get us away from that.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: And one in a hundred is the best of the best. Most are not\nnearly that good.\nJoe Fuller. I'm sitting here very anxious, because I don't think we're\ngetting down to business. It's been a wonderful conference, you know, over the\nlast two and a half days, and I think we've learned a lot. The problem is, how do\nwe capture the knowledge that's been just flowing out here?\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nAt some level there's a connection with the way we do business, and we\nneed to search for that. So what I would suggest is that, the first thing, we\ncapture the proceedings of this, and the second thing is, we form some kind of\norganization, you know, ad hoc or whatever, to pursue this information and make\nthe connections that are so obviously there.\n[In] some kind of way, the institutions have got to get involved in this.\nI think that, as someone said, every individual has a value calculation that\nthey have to make, and they have to make that trade. We can't determine the\nperception of risks for the individuals. We can't determine the value for them.\nBut what we have to do, and what we do in business is, the value proposition has\ngot to be so large that the risk is acceptable.\nSo what I would suggest is that you've got to go farther than this. You\ncan't stop here today. You've got to put some organization in place to carry\nthis forward, and mine this knowledge for the value and the benefits that are\nobviously inherent in it.\nI'm involved in risk management professionally. I haven't seen too many\nother people here that are. I did hear Mike Gernhardt talk about how he's using\nquantitative risk analysis. So I would volunteer to be a part of that group, to\ndetermine a strategy for extracting the knowledge and information so that it\nwould be more useful and of value as we go forward and explore.\nCHRIS MCKAY: I have a suggestion. I think that's a good suggestion, how do we\nconnect to the institution of NASA, in particular, the results of this conference? It\nseems to me [that] to do that you need someone who is close to the Administrator.\nHe clearly wants to get advice on this topic. Someone who is passionate with\nexperience in this area. Somebody like the Chief Scientist, John Grunsfeld. I\nthink we should add to his responsibilities this area. I think this would be a\nperfect opportunity. You've seen the conference. You were obviously one of the\nones who put it together and organized it. I really think that the mantle falls on\nyou to carry this forward within NASA as an institution, not just the near-term\nflight program, the return to flight. But also thinking long down the road.\nAlso, I think the robotic program is in need of a clear-headed assessment\nof risk. Now there the risks aren't to lives, but they are to resources. And I think\nthat that program also needs a clear risk assessment. And I think the Office of\nthe Chief Scientist right now is a good place to do it. So, all voting for John as the\nrepresentative of this?\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: Thank you, Chris, for your kind comment. But, seriously, I\nthink we have Tom Krause here from BST working on our culture. This is something\nthat the Office of the Chief Engineer, that my office, the Office of the Chief Scientist,\nBill Readdy, Office of Space Operations, Space Operations Mission Directorate--\nthis is a dialogue we have everyday. And we wanted to broaden that from NASA\nmanagement to you folks, and, as I said up front, the start of a dialogue.\nBut the other point was capturing this and you were just captured. You were\ncaptured on videotape. We're going to convert that. We've been talking, prior to\n\nDISCUSSION\nQUESTION:\na\nthe conference, about how are we going to put all this together. A number of folks\nhave been chronicling this individually, but we're going to do it institutionally as\nwell. And I know, Keith, you've thought about that a little bit. Do you want to say\nanything? Let me put Keith on the spot, and then back to you.\nKEITH COWING: I think we are quadruply redundant here. I am recording this\non my iPod, so I can be listening to it as the transcripts arrive in my e-mail box\nin about an hour up at Ames. We hope to have this online in a very short period\nof time, just the raw verbatim transcripts, with the \"ums\" and the \"ahs\" and the\nspelling errors taken care of. I'd have to talk to Bob Jacobs and some of the Ames\nfolks to get the specifics on what the follow-ons are, but there is talk of putting\nsome of this on a DVD, of putting a more comprehensive document together.\nSteve Dick and I have talked about something more comprehensive, in terms of\na history monograph. So the initial concept here, John saw the first e-mail that\nstarted this, was capture everything in as many ways as possible, so Joe, you're\npsychic, you knew what we were doing when we were first doing it.\nScott McGinnis: I'm a student here. What we do in the military, and\nI'm sure a lot of you are military, but if you assume this conference is like a six-\nmonth deployment, every time before you leave the ship you have to give your\nlessons learned. You get one line, everybody. Then the XO, I think, Dr. Grunsfeld,\nthat's you in this case, forces everyone to read it prior to going on [to] their next\ndeployment.\nSo that built a database, and as the XO you are required to make sure that\nthey all sign and verify that they have done this, proving that they have read it.\nThen, when they make the mistake again, the responsibility then lies with the\nresponsible individual, the person making the mistake. Therefore, you have a\ntraceability and a responsibility for each individual action, and also, it shortens\nthe amount of data; instead of having to watch our three days of deliberation,\nbeing able to shorten that and pull out the small pieces.\nSo that's part of the military structure, and you've got\nlittle more\ndiscipline--I think we talked about the flogging and all that kind of stuff.\n[Laughter] We have a little more coercive nature in the military to be able to do\nthat. But I'm sure NASA can muster that up. And second, you're talking about\nthe [pressure] suit of SpaceShipOne, the risk that they're taking. And I think it\nall goes back to the benefit that we haven't discussed, we've tapped around it. Dr.\nSpudis brought up the three reasons why we explore.\nI think the fourth, and Magellan showed it with his cloves, is money. And\nSpaceShipOne is doing it, one, to explore. But come on, we've got a $4.5 billion\nmarket in the tourist industry. And they are exploring not because they want to\nprove science or prove humanity. We've proved we can do it with the money. But\ncan we make it profitable? And I think if you saw the big \"Virgin\" on the side, and\nyou saw the big Sprite advertisement going on, and the M&Ms floating around,\nI think we have found one of the keys to space exploration, and that is the good\nold American greenback.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION:\nGood\nI think NASA also needs to find a way to maybe encourage that, like we did\nin the early '20s with the prizes. I think we've tapped around cost as a benefit,\nor money as a benefit. I know NASA can't get benefit monetarily that way. But\nit's definitely a point we haven't brought up.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: No, we'll be offering prizes. We've got Congressional\nauthority to do that for similar challenges. But it's clear that for Rutan, this is\nabout his passion, about pushing new envelopes. The X prize is $10 million [he\nblew off] quite a bit more than that. And I think it's great that he's been able to\nleverage the commercial sponsorship there to help offset his cost of developing\nthis Because it is opening a new frontier.\nEventually, folks who want to actually sell services will have to start\nincorporating more of the safety rigor. You probably wouldn't go out on a cruise\nship today if you knew that one out of every four or five times you weren't\ngoing to come back. So that's, again, that comes down to the profitability. And\nwhat Mike Gernhardt said is, you have to have a successful dive operation to\nhave a commercial operation be successful. And so, safety is a critical part of\nthat greenback.\nDavid Liskowsky from NASA Headquarters. I'd like to perhaps\ncomment on some of the discussion that's been going on. We're at a point in\ntime at the Agency where we've just gone through a large transformation to\nhopefully meet the exploration vision. I think we're all behind that, and that's\nwhat we'll be going forward with.\nMaybe we can take this opportunity at this time to use these changes that\nare going on in the Agency to change our message. Change our message to the\ndecision-makers, mainly Congress and the public, about what the nature of this\nbusiness is, that it is risky business. Everyone talks about that, that NASA has\nbeen a victim of its own success.\nBut maybe it's time that, as we go forward with this new exploration vision,\nand this is something that can be done through John as Chief Scientist, we have\nthe PAO [Public Affairs Office] folks who shape the NASA message let folks\nknow, truly, what the nature of the business is, and to let them know that, as we\ngo forward with this new vision, it is going to be risky. And without abdicating\nour responsibilities to meet the requirements of the CAIB [Columbia Accident\nInvestigation Board] report, there is going to be that element of risk. And it's\npart of us shaping the Agency's message and how we convey it to the public.\nMaybe this symposium can be the first step in trying to do that, in shaping\nwhat that new message should be for the exploration vision, and making,\nperhaps, a little more realistic vision than the Agency has had in the past.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD:\ncomment. Well, last comment, and we'll go to\n\"Moose\" Cobb--Robert Cobb--he's been dying to say something. Then we'll\nstay around for comments afterwards. In the packet, we gave everybody a pad of\npaper and a pen. And so, before you're allowed to leave, you'll have to write down\nat least one lesson learned, and provide that. You don't have to have a name on\n\nDISCUSSION\nQUESTION:\nJOHN GRUNSFELD:\nthere, but if you have any ideas, sketch that out and put it in the bin before you\ntake your STS-114 pin, which I really want you all to have.\nROBERT COBB: I'm the NASA Inspector General. I've been with the Agency for\ntwo and a half years, with no exploration or science background coming into the\nAgency. It's my perception that NASA works hard to dispel the notion that what\nit does is inherently risky, and the reason it does that is because there is a fear\nthat the public won't fund it if NASA tells the truth about the risk.\nThat's something that I think that this conference goes a long way towards--\nI think people recognize that the public is willing to accept risk. And that the\nidea is, the object is, that it's important for NASA to have a transparency into\nthe risks that it is accepting and to allow the public to share in understanding of\nthose risks.\nI'm Sandra Cauffman. I'm from Goddard. I think we're missing some\nbasic thing here. The question is, why we explore, and we are not really answering\nthat question. We're talking about the risks and, yes, that is very important, but\nthe people out there need to understand why it is that we're doing what we're\ndoing and what they are getting in return. They like to understand why we are\nrisking the people, but what are they getting back?\nIn the DOD world they understand why we are risking our soldiers and why\nwe are sending people to war and whatever, but in the NASA world they do not\nunderstand why are we sending astronauts. And they see pretty pictures of the\nstars and stuff, but what is it that they are getting back in return as taxpayers?\nAnd we need to really send a clear message to them. And it's not PAO [Public\nAffairs Office] stuff. It depends on each and every one of us to do that.\nJust a little story. I was in National Night Out in my neighborhood a couple\nof years ago and I was talking to my neighbor, a nice little old lady. And I am the\nDeputy Project Manager for the GOES-R Satellite. And she was asking me what I\ndid for a living and I told her about the weather satellites and all this and all that.\nAnd she just looked at me with this puzzled look on her face and she said, \"Why\ndo we need weather satellites when we have the Weather Channel?\" You know,\nthat's what we have to deal with, the perceptions out there. Yes, the risks are\nthere, but they need to understand, okay, we are risking, but what are we getting\nback? So, I just wanted to say that.\nThat's a great comment. Natalie, why don't you take that?\nNATHALIE CABROL: Actually, I would like to add on that comment because this\nis probably translating better, what these guys were saying yesterday. What is\nthe gold? Not the goal, but the gold, you know? Five hundred years ago, Magellan\nleaves, and he brings back cloves and he brings back riches. What are the riches\nthat we can show to the people today? And there are many. And we are good at it\nat NASA, but we are not good at telling people. You know, from the Moonwalks\npeople today are going to ski better. They have good Moon boots, medication,\nthings that we do in space better the health of people, the expeditions in the sky,\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nJOHN GRUNSFELD:\n\"\n\"\nj\nI also\nsomething\nends up\nin\n\"\nQUESTION:\nin the sea, or on the land are bringing [generating important discoveries]. We\nhave that, but we are not translating enough to the public. And I think this is\nwhere we need an effort.\nSteve?\nSTEVE DICK: Following up on that--I'm Steve Dick, the NASA historian. On\nFriday we're launching a series of essays on the nasa.gov Web site called \"Why\nWe Explore. And I think this will address some of the questions just raised. And\nit's not Public Affairs, it's historically nuanced and historically based. (And, by\nthe way, this is the 46th anniversary of NASA, on Friday, October 1st.) The first\nessay will deal with why we explore in the sense that exploration is necessary\nfor a creative society. And I'll talk about Ming China, which was mentioned by\nJack Stuster the other day. That's on the NASA Web site at http://www.nasa.gov/\nmissions/solarsystem/explore_main.html. And it'll be a once-a-month, \"Why We\nExplore\" series, a different essay each month.\nNATHALIE CABROL: I will wrap up quickly. But, you know, why do we explore?\nI think within us it's just because we think that somewhere on the other side of\nthe hills, as you were putting it, it must be better or something is better than\nwhat we have now. Otherwise, we wouldn't be doing it. And it's true that maybe\nthe other side of the hill has nothing particular, but what we learn along the way\nis bringing a lot of good to society, et cetera. So we need to emphasize this really,\nreally hard.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: And again, it comes down to both personal and institutional,\nas well as national. In the President's vision [for space exploration] he said, \"The\npurpose of this is to advance U.S. scientific, economic, and security interests.\nAnd it's through a broad range of things. As you say, along the ourney you learn\na lot of things that improve our life here on planet Earth.\nBut it's also the higher purpose. You know, we're trying to understand where\nwe came from. Why is there a universe? And in the process of very basic research\nlike that is where we learn the really valuable things--like quantum mechanics\nthat leads to lasers--that it would be a long time before you'd do that with just\nsubsistence farming. So, these types of things are very important.\nhave\nthat often\nresulting\ncontroversial\ndiscussions, but I have a statement that I think is true. I can't prove it, but it's\n\"Single-planet species don't survive.\nDave Leckrone, Hubble Space Telescope and NASA Engineering and\nSafety Center. I guess we're all ganging up on you because several of us must\nhave made the same comment to you. So, I want to start out by thanking you\nfor stimulating this conference, which has been absolutely fascinating. What\nfascinated me most in hearing all the speakers and the discussion and seeing the\nfilm last night about Ernest Shackleton and the Endurance expedition was this\nbusiness of what compels us to explore and take these risks in the first place,\ninstead of just adopting the fetal position in our lives.\n\nDISCUSSION\na\nsome\nAnd I have my own ideas. I actually wrote it all down and I'm going to\nexchange this for my pin later. But it sort of goes to what was said just a moment\nago, and I think Scott Hubbard mentioned this on the first day. We explore because\nwe have no choice. It's an evolutionary imperative. Our species became what it\nbecame because it explored. What was over the next hill was either a threat or a\nsource of sustenance. And if there wasn't anything there, then you had to go to\nthe next hill yet to check that one out. And I think this is built into our DNA.\nPoor Ernest Shackleton was so obsessed with exploring he couldn't even\nreally articulate why he kept going back to the Antarctic. He just had to do it.\nAnd I think at least some of us, if not all of us, within the species have it built\ninto our DNA. And I think corollaries to this are all having to do with survival--\nacquisition of knowledge, commerce, education, creating a national identity,\nfinding not only individual self-fulfillment but group fulfillment. And I think\nevery one of those relates, going way back perhaps, to our need to survive as a\nspecies. And maybe we can't survive as a one-planet species.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I agree with that absolutely. You know, we try and raise it\nto a higher plane but, ultimately, it is, I believe, hardwired into us to do this. But,\nas well, our evolution has taken us to be a species which is a thinking species,\nsometimes rational species. And, so, it's also provided us the ability to question\nwhat we do. And that's where this becomes a little bit messy, because we say,\n\"Well, is it worth the risk?\" And that comes back to where we are.\nAnd if anybody doubts that we have\nsurvival imperative to explore,\njust look at the situation we're in with science, technology, engineering, and\nmathematics in this country and where that may lead to eventually--because\ntechnology is the key to economic prosperity, which is the key to security, which\nis the key to freedom. And I believe that exploration is linked to our ability to\nstimulate people to, directly and indirectly, get a good education and make use\nof that productively.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I'm just going to build on some of these other things\nthat people have been commenting on. And, in particular, I want to play devil's\nadvocate to some of the spinoff comments that have been made.\nI agree that this is very important, and\nof the discoveries have\nbeen fantastic. But really--and this builds on your comment earlier--I think\nthat there's one question that NASA needs to be accountable to, or one big\nquestion, and that's quite simply, are we pushing the frontier? Are we pushing\nthe frontiers of science, technology, and exploration in a way that no one else\ncan--no individual, no company, no university--in a way that only NASA can?\nAnd that's the thing that we constantly have to be asking ourselves. And I think\nthis conference is part of getting at that issue.\nJIM GARVIN: Well, thanks, John. I think there's one comment notwithstanding\nthe spinoffs and everything. I mean, we can all play the game as, Dave, you said so\nwell about, this is an investment choice. It's part of our DNA. But I think it also\nbears witness to trying to generate metrics and look at what the impacts have\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION:\nbeen. And we do that perhaps ineffectively, as you've said, Nathalie. But they are\nnot transparent, they are major. And if you ask some of the technology leaders,\nexploration has begotten these catalytic effects.\nSo without it, the question that you raised, John, is the one I think this\ngroup needs to raise. How fast would we have progressed in different areas? I\nmean, maybe Darwinian progression--you know, seeking optimization whenever\nwe can--is not the game afoot, and natural selection in technology doesn't work.\nI don't know. That's a great thing to debate. You know, maybe Steve Dick's group\nin history can study that.\nBut I'm still struck by questions that when we ask people in other sectors of\nsociety--IT [information technology] being a good example--in remote sensing\nof this planet, the benefits, while maybe not tangible in terms of dollars in your\npocket, are there. We would not have microcomputing with fault tolerance, ever.\nThere would have been no imperative, except perhaps a very narrowly-defined\nsecurity interest area--which is important, of course--without this exploration\nimperative. And we demonstrated that.\nSo I think we need to do better at defining those metrics. I mean, yes, the\ntextbook metric, I think, is an important one that most people seem to forget.\nI like to think that all the textbooks have been rewritten in the last 20 years in\nmany of the areas of astronomy, physics, planetary science, and even this place\nof our own planet.\nBut anyway, I think that's the amplifier on technology progress in areas\nthat aren't the ones that have instant economic gain. That's what we should be\ndoing, and that follows on what you said so well. That's NASA's unique role as a\ngovernment agency. Otherwise, it would be private. Thanks.\nI'm Becky Ramsey, NASA Headquarters. Recently we had someone\ndo a study for us. And while it was a very interesting study, I won't go into the\nwhole thing. But one of the stats that struck me is that a majority of the people\nwe talked to said that they like NASA. They don't have a clue what we're doing,\nbut they like us. And I think we cannot lose sight of the fact that we're not the\nonly ones who want to go. It's not confined to the people in this room or the\npeople who attended this conference.\nI walked over to the little lobby bar last night. I was sitting there watching\nthe baseball game, and I got into a conversation with the bartender and some of\nthe servers. They said, \"Are you with the NASA group?\"\"Yeah.\" \"That's so cool!\"\nYou know, they don't know what we do, but they like us! And we have to build on\nthat personal connection. We are their representatives. Until Burt Rutan starts\ncharging five bucks for a trip into space, most of the people out there are not\ngoing to get to go. We have a responsibility to be their representatives and to do\nwhat they can't do yet. I mean, we talk about the spinoffs. They don't really care\nabout the spinoffs. Yes, they're important. Yes, the benefits that we [generate]\nmake everybody's lives better. But they don't know about that, you know? We\ntell them, but they don't read our cool little magazine. They don't know the\nweather satellites from the Weather Channel. They don't care that much about\n\nDISCUSSION\ndon't\nthat. They like it because it's cool, because they want to go. And I think we can't\nlose sight of the fact that that's why exploration is important to everyone else.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I absolutely agree. In fact, in other studies we've found\nthat the NASA logo--the meatball--is likely the number one brand recognition.\nThere may be a couple others that are close. The other thing we found out is that,\nwhen we were working on our renewed vision of discovery, we found out that\nmost people assumed we were already doing all these things. You know, when\nwe'd say, \"Well, what do you think about having a renewed trip to go beyond\nlow Earth orbit to the Moon and Mars?\" folks would say, \"Well, isn't that what\nyou're doing?\" And we'd say, \"Yes, that's what we're doing!\" And we have to\ncommunicate that a lot better.\nMEL AVERNER: That's not true. We're not going to Mars and Moon. We are\nattempting to do that, but it's not our mission yet. And if we say, \"Yes, we're\ngoing,\" people will go away saying, \"Great! Great! You're going!\" Okay, you got\nmy drift.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I wish Steve Squyres were here right now. I think he would\nargue with you. He has two of his children on Mars right now. I don't know. Jim,\ndo you want to comment just a little bit about our program, what some of the\nnext steps are that are already in place?\nJIM GARVIN: Yeah. Well, I think maybe Steve would do it better but if you\ndon't think we're exploring now, maybe we\ncommunicate that well. But I\nthink--two rovers 270 days on another world wandering at 300 percent beyond\nexpected lifetime is a new demonstration of that. Cassini alone is exploring at\nthe highest order.\nMEL AVERNER: I'd like to respond.\nJIM GARVIN: But, let me finish. I mean, I can go on and on with the legacy of\nhow we explore. It's just that, right now, a lot of people, perhaps in the public\nsector--and I can't speak for them because I'm a geek and work for NASA--but\nwhen I talk to them at hockey games and things where they don't always care\nwhat we do, they're stunned by what we're doing and how we're exploring. And\nhow we've learned to go from people on the surface of the Moon as our agents\nof exploration, being our representatives, to machines being those agents. And\nwe're doing that so many different ways. We're so diversified. In fact, if you ask\ncorporate America and many of my colleagues there, they're stunned. \"You're\ndoing all that, with that portfolio? You're nuts!\"\nMEL AVERNER: I'd like to get back to the bar last night. Becky, was that your\nname, doing what I would have done--drinking at the bar? Suppose you were to\ngo back to the bar and talk to those people and say, \"Well, we are exploring. We\nhave two robots on Mars doing terrific scientific things.\" Would they say, \"Wow,\nthat is great, but when are we going?\"\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:\nJOHN GRUNSFELD:\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:\nQUESTION:\nj\nJOHN GRUNSFELD:Absolutely,I agree.But just to give you the counterargument--\nand I don't know what the current number is, but there have been 13 billion hits\non the NASA Web site of which three-quarters . . .\nThat's a false number. It's not 13 billion people.\nNo, no. I didn't say it was 13 billion people.\nI know, but that's the impression that it leaves.\nJIM GARVIN: But there are well over 100 million unique IP addresses, maybe 250\nmillion total. It's all around the world, predominantly the U.S., but all around\nthe world. And, you know, you could argue about the numbers, but it is so much\ngreater than any other Web site that it's phenomenal. There is interest there, and\nthere's interest specifically because, I believe, that what we've done is we've put\ntwo human eyeballs on the surface of Mars. So people see what the rovers see and\nthey think, \"This is kind of what I would see when I get to go.\" Or, \"When we send\npeople, this is what they will see.\" And we want to do that.\nI'm Nancy Ann Budden, Naval Postgraduate School and Lunar\nPlanetary Institute in Houston. I want to build on some comments that were made\nby Joe Fuller and others about getting the word out and on some communications\nissues that Jim brought up. I oined Johnson Space Center's Exploration Office in\n'88 and I worked with a lot of you, Chris and Dale, on human exploration issues,\nand this was about the time that Bush '41 came out with his announcement that\nwe were going back to the Moon and on to Mars.\nOne of the things that we neglected to do over the next 12 years, really, was\nput into place a communications plan. We all had great ideas. We had a lot of\nmeetings. And now we have another opportunity with Bush '43 coming out with\na much more reasonable, cost-rational plan and vision. And one thing I think we\nreally need to do is put together a communications strategic plan, like a mission,\nand have a schedule and a budget and have somebody own that. Whether it's PAO\n[Public Affairs Office] through NASA Headquarters or whether it's an industry/\nNASA/university team. But we need to have a plan for that, that actually has\nsomeone own it, someone that's going to pay for it, and understand who are the\nadvocates that we need to build. Obviously, there are communities we need to get\nto within NASA, of course. We need to get to the [Capitol] Hill. But we need to\ndo it in an integrated, planned way with someone thinking about, okay--who are\nthe first people we need to get to, and when and why, and how do we integrate this\nmessage? I nominate Keith Cowing to put together the message [laughter]. And,\nJohn, I think everyone would love for you to run the communications strategy\nidea since you're getting asked to do a lot of other things this morning and since\nyou have a lot of spare time!\nAnyway, I would like to see someone own that and put together a message that\npeople agree with and actually stand behind, and make sure that it is consistent\nwith our Commander in Chief's vision of the future for space exploration.\n\nDISCUSSION\nQUESTION:\n\"\nQUESTION:\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: That is absolutely a great comment. We've received that\ncomment quite a lot, so we've actually heard that message and we've acted on\nit. Part of the transformation was to create a communications group, and we've\nlinked the legislative and the public affairs and our external relations into one\nteam so that we can help craft it. We were at the bar as well last night, talking\nabout a budget, specifically, or an increased budget, line items, and management\nfor public affairs as well. That's crucial, that we have to treat that as something\nthat's very high-priority. But in the transformation, we've combined all of those\nfor exactly the reason that you mentioned. Thank you.\nDavid Gast. I'm the other student here for the school. The thing that\nI think everyone here is touching on, and building on some of the things that\nhave just been said, is it is about communicating to the public. I think everyone\nin this room and most of the people watching NASA TV already know, kind of,\nthe reasons that we want to go out there, what we hope to accomplish, where we\nhope to go, and understand the risks that are inherent to doing that. With this\ncommunication message, what we have to do is say to everyone else, the people\nthat aren't in this room and aren't watching NASA TV, \"This is where we want to\ngo and this is why we want to go there. And, you know what? It's dangerous. Very\nlikely, things are going to crash. Maybe people are going to die. But the people\nthat are putting themselves on the line for that understand that and accept those\nrisks for themselves and believe that the goal of what we're trying to accomplish\nis worth that risk.\" So, I think it's all these things.\nWe have to communicate the risk, yes, coupled with why we think the risks\nare worth taking. We can't just say, \"We're going to do these great things, we're\ngoing to go to Mars, go to the Moon, and it will all be safe and happy and fun.\nNeither can we say, \"It's dangerous to travel through space.\" We have to say all\nthese things at the same time.\nWe talk about [that] the American people won't accept that something\nwent wrong that we could have avoided. There's always one more thing we could\nhave avoided had someone happened to think of it, had someone happened to see\nit. And I think they're willing to accept that if we're doing the best we can with\nwhat we have, there are always dangers there. And they're willing to accept that,\nagain, if we communicate that to them in advance. Like I said, the people here all\nunderstand that. We need to take what we've talked about here and present that\nto American people.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I think it's T. K. Mattingly who told us, \"Success always has\nfailure as its predecessor.\" He was more eloquent.\nKeith Cowing. Thank you, Nancy, for the nomination. When you\nhear what I have to say, you may withdraw it. To the point of Web traffic--and\nyou're right, I do Web sites for a living--citing Web numbers is so 1997, so\nPathfinder. [laughter] Google does that traffic before lunch on Sunday. It's great\nto hear these numbers, but I could go write something in my room right now.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nj\nQUESTION:\nJOHN GRUNSFELD:\nDrudge Report would pick it up and have a million hits by tonight. Big deal. The\nWeb hit numbers are important. A lot of people are looking at NASA's Web sites.\nBut we need to move on to other metrics. When a nine-year-old girl raises her\nhand at a Presidential visit and asks about space--things like that--then you\nknow. When the late-night shows make different okes about space--Jim Garvin\nhas done yeoman's duty, going on Letterman and so forth. When you start to see\nthis consciousness of space percolating up in other places . . . These numbers can\nbe very deceiving. Anybody can generate hits. You've just got to look for other\nmetrics. You've got to have a new metric every month. Just some advice from\nsomebody who does this for a living.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: This sort of follows your point, Keith. But when the\nNASA crews come into the small town of Lander, Wyoming, to go on [National\nOutdoor Leadership School] courses, they often stay after and talk to the kids\nattending courses. And when those kids leave the room, they're changed. And\nfollowing on your point, I believe, it's not about communicating to the public,\nit's about changing the public.\nKEITH COWING: As the Administrator of NASA loves to say--it is this Jesuit\nthing he has--\"one conversion at a time.\"It works. [laughter] It's self-propagating\nif you do it right.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I should say that every time an astronaut leaves the school,\nthey're changed as well.\nBill Clancy at NASA Ames. One concept that we haven't talked a lot\nabout here that I found very useful as it relates to the public, and also inside, is\nthe word sustainability. To me that's the most important word, I think, that's in\nour current vision. And I found it very useful to the shift from thinking about\nparticular missions to the program. So, rather than just talking about mission\nrisk, we have program risk. And we're talking about building competence and the\nability to go places and so on.\nI first understood this, I think, with Mars Polar Lander, where we didn't\nhave the telemetry that we needed to give us the information for building\nthe redesign that we needed. I think your example this morning is a beautiful\nexample as well, of the investment that one can make to build tools that will give\nus a competence that we know we want to have [as] part of our tool kit. So, I\nthink when we're articulating to ourselves what's our priority and our objective,\nit's the clear objective, maybe dates, and the sense of challenge. But it's all about\nsustainability, and we make decisions because we need to be here tomorrow.\nWe're not going to climb Everest today, because just getting to Everest today is\nnot our goal. We want to be able to climb again tomorrow.\nAnyone else? David.\nDAVID HALPERN: Thank you, John. And one of the things we've learned--some\nof us knew before, but some others learned--that 96 percent of space needs to be\n\nDISCUSSION\nj\nJOHN GRUNSFELD:\nQUESTION:\nexplored and 96 percent of the ocean needs to be explored. One [space] has zero\npressure and one [the ocean] has a very large pressure on the bottom. And then\nthe question comes that the ocean definitely is a place to explore, for two reasons.\nOne is [for] the creation of new knowledge, which is the same as what you're\ntalking about for outer space. But inner space also has a well-recognized aspect\nof creation of wealth. I mean, a number of [beneficial] activities have always gone\non in the ocean--and I don't mean just transportation, but subsurface as well--\nand new ones are coming along, like genomics, oceanography, things like that.\nSo, then comes the question. In the new, transformed NASA, the challenge,\nnow, would be to make use of the fact that oceans--or inner space--require the\nsame type of dedication and the same type of methodologies as are being used in\nexploration of outer space, and it's something that the new NASA might want to\nconsider. And it's actually well-poised for that because all of the science now is\nin the Science Mission Directorate. Rather than in two different stovepipes, it's\nall in one. It's a comment, not a question.\nJIM GARVIN: I'm really grateful for you for saying that because my new ob at\nNASA, with the many hats, is, in fact, to try to integrate the inner and outer\nspace exploration in this new vision. So I'm looking, as is Ghassem Asrar\n[NASA's Science Deputy Associate Administrator] and John, we're all looking for\nthe connections. Because I think the point with a vision, with an objective, with\nsome of these good points about program-thinking, which we've had in EOS for\nEarth science, we've had in the Mars program, we hope to have throughout our\nprogram--the Shuttle program--is an aspect of risk that I think is the one that\nright now strangleholds a lot of us. And that is risk of our own interpersonal\nmanagement structures to get the job done.\nAnd that, perhaps, is the genesis of the transformation, to get around\nsome of those things. But, you know, when organizations grow old they become\nwell-rooted in certain directions. And breaking roots, it's like taking a root off a\nredwood out there. I mean, it's going to stay three hundred feet tall, so you don't\nwant to have it fall over. You want to have it move. And other than slime molds,\nmost large plants don't move.\nBut I think that's the challenge. The ocean is an exploration frontier that\nwill teach us about high-pressure environments and knowledge and all that,\nand some shared technologies could be trialed there in the name of science and\nexploration to good end. And, you know, it's rather ironic to me that a large\nfraction of the ocean exists at 100-bar pressure, which is the average surface\npressure of the planet Venus. And, you know, lots of living stuff there. Interesting\nto think about.\nThanks, Jim. We'll take one more.\nGeorge Tahue from NASA Headquarters. Listening to some of the\ncomments here, an analogy is coming to my mind. If you're familiar with the\npaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and his description of evolution as punctuated\nevolution, I think NASA is, as a government agency, going through an evolution,\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nQUESTION:\nor\nsome mechanism--and\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:\nand we will continue to do so. Where we're going with this is going to take a\nvery long time, but there are certain points where there will be punctuations\nthat make great changes in very short amounts of time. And I think Apollo, that\nera, was one of those points. We may go through slower periods of time where\nwe go through those changes. But here we're at another point where we may be\nat another one of those punctuations. And this new transformation that we're\nlooking at isn't just rearranging the deck chairs. And it's something that we have\nto take internally and not just focus only on, why didn't the public understand\nwhat we're doing and how can we make them understand? It's something that we\nhave to do over this long period of time, even internally.\nWhen we had our transformation and the Office of Earth Science and\nthe Office of Space Science came together, I was listening to some of the Earth\nscience guys and saying, \"Wow, you do that? That's cool!\" Same reaction [as] at\nthe bar. So, I'd like to charge all of us to try to take a lot of this internally and\nfocus on those goals.\nAnother key thing we've heard here is to focus on the target. Stay on target.\nProtect and understand our planet. Search for life. Understand the limits of it,\nand recognize that humans and robots are the tools to do those goals. It's not just,\n\"Get us there.\" It's not just, \"Get the robots there.\" Focus on those [larger] goals.\nWe'll have these punctuated evolutions where we have a grand target that we're\nlooking for. And, in between, we'll have this balance that we keep going forward\nin trying to get that message to the public to understand that we, as an agency,\nhave a role as a public function in our society. So, those are my thoughts.\nI'm John Gaff from the Glenn Research Center. I think the Agency,\nwhile it does wonderful things--and I've been in it a long time, is not recognized\nby our society as critical to the survival of society. Nobody questions why you've\ngot the State Department, nobody questions why you've got the Treasury, and\nnobody questions why you've got the Defense Department,\nAgriculture,\neven. But for some reason, we have been unable, in my opinion, to transfer the\nknowledge that we are able to acquire for the future to being something critical\nfor the survival of the economic success of the Nation. And for the long-term\nviability of the Nation.\nSomehow, we need to start\nmaybe it's in the\neducation programs, these outreach things--where we get more institutionalized\nas a recognized, long-term investment. Until that happens, we're always going to\nbe at the margin, we're going to be at less than half a percent of the budget, and\nwe're not going to be able to compete for the other critical needs of, \"What's in\nit for me?\" with the society. Thank you.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I think that's a very good comment. I would like to point\nout that we're in relatively tough economic times right now, yet NASA is the only\nagency that's basically gotten an increase in its budget.\nDid it get one?\n\nDISCUSSION\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: Well, in the request, in the request. And even in the\nappropriations meetings, we've fared better than virtually all discretionary\nagencies. I think the issue is: We're still a discretionary agency.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I'd like to kind of second that and say two things. You\nguys are in a really tough position, almost a harder position than you were in the\nApollo era, because Apollo was something we all thought we needed to do. You\nguys are in the very, very hard position of deciding what we should do. We don't\nnecessarily need to do anything, it doesn't look like. There's not an immediate\nand obvious need. But you guys can do lots of different things. I'd like to tack onto\nDr. Halpern and Dr. Garvin's comments. I think you guys recognized this, but I'm\nnot sure that the rest of the population does--one of the amazing things about\nthe way NASA is exploring the new frontiers in space, and the way that ocean\nscience explores our frontiers here on Earth, is that for the first time, I think, in\nhuman history, you've got the conservationist, the naturalist, the scientist, and\nthe greedy capitalist wound up, in many cases, in one mind, in one human being.\nAnd you've got an organization that's already looking to protect resources that\nwe can't even exploit yet or use yet.\nI mean, does that seem strange to anybody else? That's new, folks! I mean,\nI think even more so than technologies, you guys can share lessons learned and\norganizational experiences based on how do we commercialize this thing, and\nhow do we get benefit out of it as a people without destroying it for ourselves and\nour posterity? And perhaps that could be part of your public outreach program,\nbecause, for instance, look at the market for the Toyota Prius cars. It's huge!\nThey're back-ordered, I don't know how long. Eight months back-ordered on the\ncars! You know? The public gives a darn about that kind of thing and you guys\ndo it [balance benefits and conservation] every day. It's innate. It's part of your\nnature. That's important.\nUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Coupled with that and, again, talking about expanding\nthe vision and explaining the risk, is that the vision we want to put out there is\nnot just [that] we want to go back to the Moon and learn how to go to Mars. But\nI think it's a bigger vision than that. It's partially this and partially the thing that\nhe's talking about. It's [that] we need to present both, this is the next step on\nwhich we are currently embarking, but also, this is a vision for the future that we\nhope to achieve by taking these steps. And that vision doesn't have to be perfect.\nIt doesn't have to be exactly what we're going to arrive at. But it has to be a goal\nbeyond just, you know, as great as the goal was to put a man on the Moon and\nbring him back to Earth. Why? Now why are we doing that?\nAnd we've talked a lot about that, but I think that needs to be part of what\nwould go out to the public, and what NASA thinks about internally, and each of\nus thinks about internally, in ourselves, as what is our long-term pictured goal\nthat all these things are steps toward? And that goes for exploring the seas as\nwell. You know, all these explorations are not just, I want to go to the bottom\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nof the Marianas Trench. It's, I want to find out more about the Earth. I want to\ndiscover more about us as a species. I want to maybe discover things that will\nsave our species or our Nation or whatever at some point in the future. So that\nneeds to be a part under consideration as well.\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: Okay, well, I think we're up to the end here. I just want to\ngive all of you a big \"thank you very much\" for participating in this. I know I've\nlearned a lot. I think we've all had a lot of good dialogue. I got a few too many\naction items, but they're very important ones and we will take that forward, back\nto NASA, and for those of us here from NASA, I hope you take that all out. I really\nwant to encourage you again, though, as you leave here, to regard this as the start\nof a dialogue. There's no question that this is one we'll talk about sustaining. I\nthink this dialogue will be sustained probably for all of human history as we push\nour frontiers, as we move out.\nI'd like to bring Scott Hubbard, the Director of the Ames Research Center,\nto give us some closing comments.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nOpen next section\n\ni\nl\ni\nA P P E N D I X\nn c os ng\n\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nClosing Comments\nMy job mainly right now is to roll the credits and thank a whole bunch\nof people who made this all happen. Before I do that though, I'd like to take the prerogative\nof the chair here and just make a few additional comments from things that I'd written\ndown in the last couple of days as well as some prethinking. One is the incredible speed\nwith which we are moving ahead in space exploration. Now that sounds perhaps silly on the\nsurface of it, but think for a moment. In the first 50 years of aviation, a million aircraft were\nbuilt, most of them used multiple times. In the first 50 years of space exploration, there\nhave been exactly 4500 launches total worldwide.\nThe difference, the gap, between where we are in commercial aviation today and\nwhere we are in space exploration is huge. The fact that Burt Rutan and his group can be\nso successful today is built on investments that were made, in some cases decades ago, by\nthe government. Now where does this lead us? This leads us to establishing a viable space\nexploration industry eventually, such that there will be a trailing edge of people who can\nmake a business case and make money out of not only communication satellites, but types\nof space travel.\nDi\nScott Hubbard serves as director of NASA's Ames Research Center, in the heart of California's Silicon\nValley. Hubbard's tenure at Ames began in 1987 and has included a variety of management roles. From\n1997 to 1999, he served as the deputy director of the Space Directorate at Ames Research Center. Prior\nto his current appointment, Hubbard was deputy director for research at Ames. In March 2000, Hubbard\nwas called to NASA Headquarters where he successfully redefined all robotic Mars missions in response\nto the Mars failures in 1999.\nScott Hubbard\nrector, NASA Ames Research Center\n\nj\nj\nThe Space Shuttle orbiter Endeavour and\nFacility after spending nine days in space\n(NASA Image # 96PC-0155)\nThe two analogies that are already there are the railroads, and, as I said,\ncommercial aviation. The railroads that got the right of way, Union Pacific,\nSouthern Pacific, came together and drove that nail out there in Utah [ oining the\ntwo railroads]. In aviation, the government invested in mail routes. And, eventually,\nthis form of investment and technology and subsidies led to multibillion dollar\nindustries. I think we are just on the verge of being able to see something like this\ncome out in space exploration, beyond something like the commercial satellite\nindustry. And I think it's going to be an absolutely fascinating ourney over the\nnext 10 years or so--maybe it's 5 years, we'll see--as this plays out.\nThe second major point is to underscore the false dichotomy of human\nversus robots. The only thing that will happen is the ratio will change over time.\nAnd, at some point, a human being, I'm looking at Chris McKay here, will be the\ntool of choice for exploring the Moon, and, particularly, exploring Mars. If we\ncould put him in a little box, I'm sure he would go with the MSL (Mars Science\nLaboratory) in '09.\nSo where do we go with this dialogue? I agree completely with what John\nsaid, with what many of you said. This can't be a one-of-a-kind. I think the\npublic will come along if we tell our story well, but we need professional help.\nSome people say we're beyond help; we need treatment.\nBut if we can talk about the risk of not exploring, the risk of losing our\nimagination, and maybe, ultimately, a second home for humanity, I think that\nwe have some compelling things in addition to the kind of spinoffs that may\ncome from what Nathalie Cabrol found by exploring these lakes, that your blood\noxygenation goes up, your heartbeat goes down. What does that mean? What\ndoes that mean for the biomedical community?\nThere are a lot of things in there, but telling the big future story, I think,\nis something we haven't done and we need to do. And we saw some storytellers\nhere in the last few days who just grabbed us. In giving a lot of talks, there's\nthe pin-drop moment, and we hit the pin-drop moment in those places were\neverybody was just absolutely transfixed by the story.\nSo, where can we go with this dialogue? One thing is that taking risks can\nprepare you for the future--often in ways you didn't even think of. I'm going to\ngive you one or two examples from my own experience, which has been largely\ntaking programmatic and technical risks.\nIn 1975 very little was known about repairing neutron damage in gamma\nray detectors. So I conducted, at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, a bunch of\nexperiments with a 72-curie plutonium-beryllium source. Now, if you consider\nthat your smoke detector is picocuries, you get some idea of how hot this was.\nSo, we went through the safety procedures. I signed up to the risks. Twenty-\nfive years later, at the age of 50 or so, I had dual cataracts in both eyes, which\nwas a possible outcome of doing that. But today, Bill Boynton with that same\ndetector orbiting Mars, figuring out where all the water-ice is, is able to repair\nhis detector, because of what we learned doing those experiments, almost 30\nyears ago, about how you heat the detector and get rid of the neutron damage.\nOPENING PHOTO:\nits crew of six glide in to Runway 15 at\nKennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing\non the STS-72 mission, the first Shuttle\nflight of 1996.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nYou never know what kind of a risk, and what kind of information, is going to\nprepare you for the future.\nIn a similar fashion, in April of 1990, I went in front of the Headquarters\nfolks and proposed the ridiculous mission of using a Delta-2 and a single probe\nand a cruise stage going to Mars and landing, of all things, using an airbag.\nThe risk there was ridicule and being laughed out of the room, which almost\nhappened. Fortunately, Jim Martin, the legendary leader of the Viking mission,\nthought there was something to it. And 14 years later, we have now used that\ntechnology three times successfully.\nSo, what I'm building up to is the analogy of setting up the Astrobiology\nInstitute in 1998. We took a risk--and Keith Cowing was part of this--in bringing\ntogether an interdisciplinary group of physicists, biologists, mathematicians,\nastronomers, who never talk to each other. Or if they do, the intersection is only\nat one point. And saying, let's all think from our disparate points of view about\na much broader series of questions, like where do we come from, are we alone in\nthe universe, where are we going?\nOut of that came a field today, and you've heard references to it, of more\nthan 1,000 scientists worldwide who are engaged in this in everyday research\nand view this interdisciplinary work, the interaction--the action is at the\nintersections--as being where we're headed for research in the future. So I\nwould say today, the group that has participated the last two and a half days at\nthis has been at a seminal, similar event of bringing together communities that\nhave perhaps not communicated as much as they should--robotic, human, risk-\nevaluators, decision-makers. And, so, what we need to do to keep this moving is\nhave the dialogue; perhaps we have a road map, we certainly need a distillation\nof lessons learned from this, and I would be willing to bet that we're going to\nultimately have, if John takes his action items here, thousands of people, maybe\ntens of thousands of people, who are engaged in doing the kind of work that we\ngot started here over the last two days.\nSo with that, let me roll the credits and, first of all, thank the idea men--\nJohn Grunsfeld, Keith Cowing, the people that had some of the initial concepts\nfor this. Let me thank the Naval Postgraduate School, Admiral Dunne, and,\n\" \"\nIN AVIATION, THE GOVERNMENT INVESTED IN MAIL ROUTES.

I had\ngiven some time to thoughts about risk and the way we use it and the way we misuse it\nand all of those things. Well, as the morning went on, the first speaker ticked off the first\nthree or four of my items, and the next speaker came along and fixed them all up. And, so,\nmost of the things that I thought I would like to comment on were gone. Then, just to put\nthe crowning blow on it all, we go in this afternoon and I listen to the most amazing set of\npeople that I could ever imagine. And I'm sitting here listening to this and saying, \"Every\none of these people, individually, has done more than me and all my friends.\" Now, how in\nthe world do you get up and talk after that?\nWell, I decided that the first thing I had to do was to talk about something different.\nSo, what I would like to do tonight is perhaps a little deviation, but I hope my thoughts are\nin the context of what you are discussing.\nWe have a nomenclature issue when we talk about exploration and the word explore: to\nsome people, that means visit planets. To some people, it means do great science. To some\ni\nly II\nT. K. Mattingly is one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He served as a member of\nthe astronaut support crews for the Apollo 8 and 11 missions and was the astronaut representative in\ndevelopment and testing of the Apollo spacesuit and backpack (EMU). He was designated command\nmodule pilot for the Apollo 13 flight but was removed from flight status 72 hours prior to the scheduled\nlaunch due to exposure to the German measles. He has logged 7,200 hours of flight time--5,000 hours in\njet aircraft. A veteran of three space flights, Mattingly has logged 504 hours in space, including 1 hour and\n13 minutes of extravehicular activity (EVA) during his Apollo 16 flight. He was the command module pilot on\nApollo 16 (16-27 April 1972), was the spacecraft commander on STS-4 (26 June to 4 July 1982) and STS\n51-C (24-27 January 1985). After retiring from NASA in 1989, Mattingly continued his work in space science\nin the private sector, focusing on developing low-cost and reusable launch systems for commercial use.\nThomas \"T.K.\" Matt ng\nFormer NASA Astronaut\n\nOPENING PHOTO:\nAstronaut Thomas K. Mattingly II,\nApollo 16 Command Module pilot.\n(NASA Image # S71-51295)\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nof us--I like to call ourselves explorers--but I tell you what, the ride is one hell\nof a good show. So I think we have different perspectives on what exploring is.\nBut once you get away from this community of ours, you find that the word\ntakes on a different connotation. We use the expression \"to explore business\nopportunities\" and the expression \"explore new kinds of things.\" And, in my\nmind, this \"explore\" means to do or to learn something new. It doesn't matter\nwhether it's science or how to manage an organization or how to go places. It's\nwhen you do something new. And, in my mind, that can take on something of a\ndifferent connotation. And so, if you look at it that way, then there are a lot of\npeople in the world that take risks. In our business, we talk about risk and the\nfirst thing we think of is some poor kids' young bodies laying there in the ashes.\nWell, there are a lot of other risks, and they're very, very real and they're\nvery important. And for those of you that have tried to start a business or have\ntried to run one with your own money, you understand what the word risk means.\nAnd it is just as overpowering as anything else.\nWhen I had an opportunity to launch the Atlas rockets--which, by the\nway, I consider to be one of the highlights of my career opportunities--I can tell\nyou, it's infinitely easier to sit on top of one of the things that NASA launches,\nbecause you are absolutely in the best hands you could ever be and you will never\nfind a lower level of risk. When you go launch it and it's your decision--it's not\na committee--you've got investors that you've just assured it's going to fly. But\nit's the same old rocket hardware and it's just as interesting. And that really gets\nyour attention.\nI know that the docs like to record the heart rate--they want to know what\nJim's heart rate is at launch and at entry and when he steps around. I tell you\nwhat--any of those statistics they collected on us won't compare with making\nthe decision to launch something that's got your money riding on it. That's a\ndifferent ball game. And it is just as interesting as people.\nSo, my point is not to belittle people. My point is to say risk is a different\nthing to a lot of different people for a lot of different reasons. And, so, when we\nsay we're taking an acceptable risk or whatever we're going to do, you have to put\nyourself in the place of \"risk to whom and for what?\" One of the speakers this\nmorning reiterated that we all think of risk of life. Okay, that's pretty easy. There\nis a property risk, but, actually, I think we can take almost all physical property\nand lump it together under financial arrangement of some sort, except in those\nrare cases when we're going to use or deplete a natural resource that doesn't get\nrefurbished. I remember one time in the Shuttle program, we just woke up one\nday and discovered that our demands--if we met the flight schedule--would have\ndepleted the Earth's supply of helium the first year. So we kind of had to do some\nmore engineering. So there is an example of another kind of property that you\nput at risk. But you also put at risk opportunities, and that's opportunities for\nyou to do something else with your time. The investor could invest in something\nthat's going to come out better--there's a million things that could happen. So\nthe connotation of risk is something that you have to stop and think about.\n\nJohn Young (left) and T. K. Mattingly in the recovery raft after\nthe splashdown of the Apollo 16 capsule.\n(NASA Image S72-36510)\nIt seems to me that in a democratic world one of the principles we have is\nthat there are human rights that belong to everybody and we go to great lengths\nto take care of those. And as school kids we were taught that our rights would\nend when yours start. Okay? That was an easy principle.\nThat same thing applies to third parties. When we do our trick and we\nlaunch things over people and around them, or when you run nuclear power\nplants, or when you do all kinds of things, there are innocent parties who did not\nget to vote on taking a risk. And one has to think very seriously about who it is\nthat has the authority to put in jeopardy somebody who didn't even participate\nin the decision. One of the nice things about the discussion this afternoon was\neverybody that I listened to was in activities that did not put\nthird parties at risk. They were responsible for other people,\nthey were responsible for a lot of things, but the innocent\nbystander was generally immune to their activities. And so\nthat [responsibility to innocent parties] puts an obligation on\nall spaceflight from the beginning.\nWhen we go out of the atmosphere on those missions\nand come back in, we're going through something that's\nvery traumatic and irreversible. Spaceflight is complex by its\nnature. It's large in scope and it has a whole range of critical,\nirreversible decisions in a harsh and unforgiving environment.\nOther than that, it's a wonderful place. [Laughter]\nThat first step has got to be right, and with that comes\nan obligation to all those kids out there in the world that\naren't part of our club and aren't having fun doing things that\nwe enjoy. It's easy for us to decide, \"Hey, this is good stuff,\"\nwhether it's good science or just a ball to go do, that's one\nthing. That's different than saying, \"I'm going to fly over your cow pasture and\nmaybe drop something on your house.\" People tend to get irritated at that.\nSo, what I wanted to do is step back for just a second and talk about some of\nthe perceptions so that it can help frame the question. Now, I'm not a visionary.\nI don't know what the world should do--I don't have any idea about whether we\nshould explore Timbuktu or Saturn or whatever. But in my opportunities in life,\nI've had a chance to do a lot of really neat things where you could have a vision\nabout how to get it done. And so I guess I'm one of those people you call an\nimplementer instead of a visionary. That's what I enjoy doing, and I think that's\nthe kind of things that have just worked out in my favor.\nSo while not a visionary, I have watched some. What I'd like to do is share\nwith you some thoughts about groups that I have watched and the characteristics\nof them. Because I'm going to make two assumptions--and these are not\ndebatable, because they're assumptions. I'm going to assume that you either\ngo forward or you die. Civilizations do that. So if you aren't making progress,\nyou're in deep trouble. Maybe it'll take time to play out, but that's the end. And\nI can't prove that, but, boy, do I believe it.\nTHOMAS \"T.K.\" MATTINGLY II\nREMARKS\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nSomebody gave me the analogy that it's like riding a bicycle. If you try to\nsit still and not move, it's a very difficult job. And if you can get up a little speed,\nyou can do a lot of things. That's one assumption.\nThe other I'm going to assume is that there is no way we will not explore\nthe universe. I have no idea what the timeframe is, but one of my investor friends\ngave me a piece of counsel one day when we were having trouble and couldn't\nfigure out how we were going to make the next step. And he said, \"Just don't get\nin the way of success.\"\nGoing back to Jim Lovell's [Apollo 13] mission, there's one lesson that I\ngathered from our ground risk management and getting a chance to watch the\nreal pros go do that. When we started, within an hour of Jim telling the world\nhe's got a problem, we didn't have electricity, we didn't have oxygen, we're on a\ntrajectory that's not coming home, and we don't have any ideas. And those cats\non the ground solved these problems one at a time. The only rule was, you've got\na problem to solve, you've got one to solve, and you've got one to solve, and we\ndo have a cutoff date when we need to have all this finished--it was later than Jim\nwanted it, but it beat the deadline.\nBut the principle was, don't get in the way of success. Assume that your\nbuddy is going to do his job and you don't want to be the one that's holding up\nthe show. With that, we went through a series of really challenging resolutions to\nproblems. Where folks really didn't know, but they said, \"Boy, if they can figure\nout how to get the water to last, we'll figure out how to get the electricity over\nthere.\" And it all came together, as you know.\nSo I'm going to assume that we're going to go do these things and that\nwe're mature enough we recognize that, I think, every success is preceded by\na failure. At least in my experience, it's not real clear you can have a success\nwithout preceding it with something that's humbling or threatening. Certainly\nmy career has gone through that sort of cycle.\nThe things we learn, we learn most easily from things that don't work.\nYou've got to be objective, you've got to be honest with yourself, but the things\nthat fail are the things that teach us. I have known a few people who could learn\nfrom success, but you know, when you're feeling good, it's really hard to be self-\ncritical. And so you miss a lot of lessons that you could have had. So don't ever\nbe afraid of failure.\nSo, if that's the case, if my premise is right--we're going to make progress\nand we're going to go explore--then our job is don't get in the way of success.\nWe don't know from the government side what the funding profiles will be, what\nthe timing is, but we need to be prepared to do whatever opportunity presents.\nSo how do you do that? I don't know. And I certainly wouldn't tell you anything\nother than sea stories about places I've been. But we're not in those places. We're\ngoing forward. And that's a new game and a new set of challenges and new places\nto go. That means rethink.\nSo, in that vein, let me just summarize my observations from spending\n20 years in government programs and then a few years working as a contractor\n\nDON'T WORRY ABOUT THE REST OF THEM, BECAUSE THEY D\nNUMB\nTER.\nTER.\nER ONE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR, QUANTIFIABLE, SIMPLE-TO-\nUNDERSTAND OBJECTIVE. STEP ONE. IF YOU DON'T FILL THAT SQUARE IN,\nDON'T WORRY ABOUT THE REST OF THEM, BECAUSE THEY DON'T\nT MAT\nT\n\"\n\"\non government programs and then the last ten years working on commercial\nventures. I've been in large corporations--government certainly is a large\norganization, DOD's a large organization--and I've been in some small startups\nand entrepreneurial ventures. We've made mistakes and we've had some successes.\nSo I've tried to catalog for you the signatures that have shown up in every success.\nAnd some were hinted at today and I just wanted to reiterate them.\nNumber one, you have to have a clear, quantifiable, simple-to-understand\nobjective. Step one. If you don't fill that square in, don't worry about the rest of\nthem, because they don't matter.\nOnce you've got that, you have some more challenges. And it takes creating\nan environment where getting it right is more important than who's right. You\nhave to have a group--and big things can't be done by small groups and by\nindividuals, only by large organizations. The trick in leadership is to create the\nenvironment where getting it right is all that counts, because the job's too hard\nto do anything else.\nSo if you've got that, then you have to have competent practitioners.\nWithout that, you won't go anywhere. Now, back in the Apollo days, that was one\nthing no one had to worry about. Because if you just said, \"Job opening--work\non Apollo,\" you know, the line went all the way around the county, because it was\nsomething every one of the young kids wanted to do.\nToday we have to compete for opportunities and people, especially. They\nwill come to an electric environment. The kinds of things that you folks do will\ndraw people. They are there--and they're the people who want to be there, people\nwho want to be personally accountable.\nSo in this group, this constellation of things that I have observed as uniform\nqualities, you have got to have a good objective, you have got to have personal\naccountability--eyeball to eyeball, participant to participant. That's not an org\nchart with lines on it, that's real-world accountability based on human relations\nthat we have with each other. You have to be competent in your job.\nI would caution that one place we've gotten trapped is the resume trap\nor the logo trap. I'm the world's worst in reading a resume and knowing what\nsomebody can do. I feel pretty good after working with them for a couple of days,\nand then I know what kind of people I'm around. But I have a real hard time with\na resume; they can look really good or really bad.\nThe logo trap is the other side of that. How many times have we worked in an\nindustry that's maturing, where the logo of the company is on the wall and it has a\nB\"\nNUM\"\nNUM\nT\"\nTTER.\"\nTTER.\nTHOMAS \"T.K.\" MATTINGLY II\nREMARKS\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nrecord of miraculous accomplishments--year after year they've done spectacular\nthings. All of us, including the employees, believe that we are part of that logo.\nAnd it happens at NASA, it happens at any large organization with a history. We\nidentify with that logo, that's a symbol of things that have happened.\nMaybe, after a period of time, the people that do those things aren't there\nanymore. And unless somebody has been very, very careful to be prescient\nenough to create an honest-to-goodness succession plan, you'll find people who\nknow the language, who look good, but do not have that personal, gut feeling for\nwhat it's about that's necessary to do these things that push the envelope. When\nyou find that situation, the places that succeed recognize it, and then they take\nsteps to fix that.\nThere's nothing magic about this except to face up to the fact that you know\nwhat you know and you know what you don't. And with that, those signatures\nhave shown up at every one of these little organizations that I've had a chance to\nbe exposed to.\nSo, while I can't tell the answers to the next job and the next challenge,\nbecause each one's unique, I would commend to you that these observations,\nthat I think I picked up primarily from working at NASA; they have been\nuniform signatures. We even applied the much-maligned aerospace management\nprocess to turning around a very nonglamorous company, where we did a really\nexcellent job of turnaround, coming out of bankruptcy to create some almost\nembarrassingly good results--done with people in a nonglamorous field and a\ngroup that two years ago was absolutely demoralized and hopeless.\nIt all came from just getting them all on the same page with the right orders.\nSo these are techniques that are not just peculiar to the high-tech business, they\nwork everywhere in life. So that's my observation.\nI do have one question I'd like to ask of you. When I was a kid, I lived in\nMiami, and I used to go down to the beach, like all high school kids, and look up at\nthe sky and see the Moon, and you kind of wondered, \"Gee,\" you know, beer talk,\n\"Hmm, wonder what the Earth would look like [from] up there?\" Well, that was\ntoo preposterous for even high school kids to talk about. Strange things happen.\nI had a chance to go and serve what I thought would be a couple-year tour\nwith NASA, and they were doing this program called Apollo and space-centered\nlife. I knew that when I got there, I wasn't going to the Moon. But, you know, I\nmight be getting in at the right time to go to Mars. [Laughter] Well, that schedule\nhas been modified a couple of times and I said, \"Well, okay. I did get to go to the\nMoon, I hope that doesn't blow my trip to Mars.\" [Laughter]\nThen I woke up and said, \"Maybe I could be the program manager to send\nsomebody to Mars.\" So tonight, I would plead with all of you in the exploration\nworld. Before I turn the lights out, I want to see pictures of people bouncing on\nMars. And that's your job. Thank you.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nNASA Image/Renee Bouchard\n\nMichael Foale\nNASA Astronaut\nRemarks\nThis morning, we heard an awful lot of eye-opening stories\nabout how we are exploring the planet today. I'm awed to be in the presence of so many\nnotable people here in the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Actually, this aquarium has figured\ninspirationally in motivational movies such as Star Trek and other grand works of science\nfiction. I should tell you I have been motivated by Star Trek, I think we heard that this\nafternoon from Chris McKay.\nPreparing for this talk, I continually asked myself why I, of all people, have been asked\nto speak to you this evening. And I kind of went through the thoughts. Maybe because\nI most recently returned from space--that seems an obvious one. Or because I've been\nfortunate enough to survive six flights to space. Or worse, because somebody sees me as\nprone to avoiding near disasters throughout my life. I know someone in my management\nchain believes that.\nI do not feel I'm a particular specialist in risk-taking or taking risks personally. Rather,\nI see myself as rather conservative about mitigating risks that I see ahead of myself and\nmy family.\nMir 23 and Mir 24\ndays, 11 hours, and 19 minutes.\nMi\nl\nle\nMichael Foale was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in June 1987. He served as a mission\nspecialist on STS-45, STS-56, STS-63, and STS-103. He was flight engineer 2 on\n(ascent on STS-84 and return on STS-86). On his last flight, 18 October 2003 to 29 April 2004, Foale\nserved as International Space Station (ISS) Expedition-8 Commander. The Expedition-8 crew launched\nfrom Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan aboard Soyuz TMA-3 and docked with the ISS on 20 October\n2003. His six-month tour of duty aboard the International Space Station included a 3 hour, 55 minute\nextravehicular activity (EVA). Mission duration was 194 days, 18 hours, and 35 minutes and, at its\nconclusion, Foale became the U.S. record holder for most cumulative time in space, having logged 374\nchae Foa\nNASA Astronaut\n\nZvezda Service Module, the ISS living\n(NASA Image # ISS007-E-17762)\nj\ndoing this\nj\nOPENING PHOTO:\nEquipped with a bungee harness,\nastronaut Michael Foale, Expedition 8\ncommander and NASA's science officer\non the International Space Station (ISS),\nperforms squat exercises on the Treadmill\nVibration Isolation System (TVIS) in the\nquarters. (Zvezda is Russian for \"star.\")\nThere are many guests amongst us who do not work at NASA, but have very\nrelevant experience in exploration. Please believe that I see risk perception and\nits mitigation as a rather subjective issue--I think we've heard that a number\nof times today.\nI, and NASA, do not know all the answers. In fact, I feel we may have strayed\noff course concerning our approach to risk in some areas. We, NASA, need to\nhear more than anything else not Mike Foale's point of view on risk, but those of\npeople outside of NASA looking in. I feel my ob today is to sort of set the scene\nand issue provocative opinions to you--I mean, I'm opinionated--and you are\nobliged to dispute them in the coming days.\nThat said, I'm going to give you my personal view of America's space\nexploration and the risk that comes with it. But first, I'd like to set the scene for\nspace exploration in the future, inspired by the President's vision for exploration,\nby showing the first part of a video made within the astronaut office by astronauts\nand narrated by astronauts--one of whom is myself.\n[Narration from video is indented.]\nFemale speaker: We are, by nature, explorers. Look at the centuries of\nhistories where people were committed to finding new worlds and\nestablishing them. And now I think it's time for us to go beyond low\nEarth orbit and do the very same thing.\nFemale Speaker: Human beings are insatiably curious. We want to\nknow what's out there in the stars. It's part of who we are; it's part of\nwhat we are.\nMale Speaker: Being outside on a spacewalk is the coolest thing you\ncan imagine--beyond belief. You're\nimportant thing,\nyou're building a spaceship and the world is rolling by. It's absolutely\nbreathtaking.\nMale Speaker: The Space Station is teaching us how to explore. Before\nwe can go to the Moon or to Mars, we have to learn a lot about the\nhuman body. What happens when you put yourself inside a spaceship\nfor weeks and even months? What food are we going to eat? Are we\ngoing to bring it all in cans or are we going to grow some food on\nboard? What sort of spaceships do we have to build?\nMichael Foale: When we look back 50 years to this time, we won't\nremember the experiments that were performed, we won't remember\nthe assembly that was done. What we will know was that countries\ncame together to do the first oint international project, and we will\nknow that that was the seed that started us off to the Moon and Mars.\nMale Speaker: I think you have to learn to live and work on the Moon\nfirst, so you can make mistakes when you're only two and a half days\naway from a can of beans.\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nMale Speaker: Human beings can do things that robots will never be able\nto do. They can anticipate, and they can handle, unexpected problems.\nMale Speaker: On the Moon, we ran into about 97 problems that\nnobody thought we'd run into, and we fixed every one.\nMale Speaker: We are going to continue to explore. We can confront the\nmajority of the problems by going to the Moon. And then, building on\nthat will give us the confidence and the technical ability to be able to\nstep further into the solar system and turn our sights towards Mars.\nMale Speaker: We go to places where human beings typically can't\nlive because these environments offer discoveries that defy our\nimagination. We're going to say, \"Wow!\"\nMale Speaker: We want to know where we should land; we want to\nknow where the water is. The robots blaze the trail--provide us with\na path to get there. They're finding out whether we could stand on\nthe surface of Mars. Those robots have raised their electronic eyes\nand given us those first glimpses of the horizon of Mars. To be able to\nstand on the surface of Mars and feel the wind blowing of Mars's thin\natmosphere is going to be a tremendous achievement.\nFemale Speaker: Can we use some of these resources? Can we prosper\nhere? Can humans live here?\nMale Speaker: So far, we have only sent people as far as the Moon,\nand sent our robots just as far as the edge of our solar system. We are\njust starting to understand our place in the universe, the perspective\nthat the universe gives us, and the tremendous, infinite variety that\nthe rest of the universe holds. That's where we are headed, and that's\nwhere we'll go after Mars.\n[Video segment ends]\nAfter watching that video, or others just like it, I find myself kind of\nnaturally responding with enthusiasm and excitement. I kind of go, \"Wow!\" It\nmakes me feel that we humans can do anything if we agree on a common purpose\nand simply put our minds to it.\nHowever, evocative and inspirational as my astronaut colleagues can be,\nwe are leaving out of the message something terribly important--risk. Why is\nthat? It's because we feel instinctively, maybe--especially in this year--it will\nspoil the mood of our message. That it will conjure up very painful and recent\nmemories of lost friends and failed missions.\nMy theme to you this evening is that we must always talk about risk when\nwe enthuse about exploration. The two are inevitably connected. And I think that\nmessage is coming home today.\nRisk--what is it? It's obvious when disaster strikes, such as when Shackleton's\nship, Endurance, was forestalled in his second attempt to reach the South Pole,\nMICHAEL FOALE\nREMARKS\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\ncrushed by the ice while trapped far from his goal. We consider an activity to\nhave risk if a foreseeable outcome has undesirable or dangerous consequences.\nEverybody knows what risk is, but it's according to their own subjective standards.\nRisk today, in Western society, might be perceived to be--as T. K. Mattingly\nreferred to--a financial activity or the stock market, allowing your children to take\nthe bus to school, not evacuating in advance of a hurricane warning, or not wearing\na seatbelt. And these examples are seen as risks because the consequences can\nsignificantly change our lives through financial ruin or loss of life.\nSo this evening when I speak of risk, I mean the risk of people being killed.\nHistorically, or even today in underdeveloped countries, loss of life was an\nunfortunate, but commonplace, occurrence within families and all other types\nof social units. Every child experienced soon in their childhood somebody dying\nor they saw a dead person. This might have included the ravages of marauding\nneighbors, war, starvation, and disease.\nBefore Christopher Columbus, if a proposal of exploration was made--be it\nto scout the far hills and tribes at a distance, or to utilize substantial resources\nof the community to send ships on marauding or exploring adventures--the risk\nentailed would appear to carry consequences not worse, and possibly better than,\nthe risk of inaction.\nInaction might simply mean waiting for unknown peoples to find and attack\nthe community or running out of food or tradable goods. So the imperative to\nexplore then and to take risks then was strong, because the risk was understood\nwidely to be a means to survival and the reduction of future risk.\nWhen a ship that had carried away a large fraction of the able-bodied\ncommunity did not return or became known to be lost, the news would be just as\npainful then as it is today, but I think the shock should have been less.\nHow do exploration and risk play a part on Earth now? I see exploration\ntaking place under the sea, such as underwater archaeology, or on land, such as\nthe search for Mars meteorites in deserts or Antarctica, or in mountaineering--\nand in space, as we develop human and robotic space missions beyond the realm\nof Earth. I do not see these combined exploration activities consuming anything\nbut a small fraction of the world's economic and human production.\nI do not know how today's activity should be compared to that [of] more\nthan a hundred years ago, but my feeling is that outlays for exploration today\nrepresent a smaller fraction of our output than in the past. So, in risk terms,\nnowadays activities are just as dangerous for participants as any exploration\nundertaken in history--dying is dying. There has been no change in the fact that\npeople can be injured today and lose their lives while exploring.\nWhat has changed is the public expectation for success, and the public\nshock when risk and danger show themselves as injury and loss of life. We're\nnot often exposed to death and severe illnesses or injury in our personal lives,\nunless we're in a group that we could label as thrill-seekers--and we've been\navoiding that term here today--or work in medical or emergency services, or in\na war zone.\n\nSHOCK WHEN RISK AND DANGER SHOW THEMSELVES AS INJURY AND\nWHAT\nIFE.\nIFE.\nI'm going to show you slides of a series of missions that I did not take part\nin. I was too young. I was just an enthusiastic, dreamy watcher of these events\nthat took place in the '60s. I'm going to show you astronauts walking out to their\nvehicle and then the vehicle launching. And I want to tell you to think about how\nyou, the manager sending that astronaut out to the launch pad, might feel--or\nthe family. And then I think about how you, as the astronaut or the risktaker\nwalking out to that launch, might feel about your risk.\n[slide] This is Alan Shepherd getting into his Mercury capsule in 1961, May\n5th. After the Soviet Union had orbited Yuri Gagarin, April 12th of that year,\nPresident Kennedy stated in a press conference, \"No one is more tired that I am\nin seeing the U.S. second to Russia in the space field.\" And he went on to say,\n\"We are, I hope, going to be able to carry out our efforts with due regard to the\nproblem of the life of the men involved this year.\"\nSo he did not say it directly, but he was referring to the high risk of putting a\nhuman into space. James Webb, the then NASA Administrator, issued a statement\nno more optimistic. \"NASA has not attempted to encourage press coverage of\nthe first Mercury Redstone manned flight.\" I think that's incredible in today's\nenvironment. \"We must keep the perspective that each flight is but one of many\nmilestones we must pass. Some will completely succeed in every respect. Some\npartially, and some will fail. From all of them will come mastery of the vast new\nspace environment on which so much of our future depends.\"\n[slide] This is Alan Shepherd's lift off on a Redstone rocket, flying for no\nmore than 15 minutes until splashdown. The flight was a success. Afterwards,\nthe risk perceived by the public may have been assuaged a touch. But my point\nto you is, because this was a first flight of a new nature carrying a human, it had\ngreat risk. So, like a test pilot, I believe any first flight with a human being carries\nincreased risk, especially in recently designed, new space vehicles.\nI'm going to show you a series of slides of space missions, as I mentioned,\nthat I believe carried a particularly high and increased risk. Initially, these\nmissions are ones I did not take part in, and so your opinion is as strong as mine.\nI think you should hold your opinion and see if it corresponds with that which\nI'm going to express to you.\nIn some cases, this risk may have been well understood by the public, such\nas this first flight of Al Shepherd. Other slides I will show, the public was much\nHAS CHANGED IS THE PUBLIC EXPECTATION FOR SUCCESS, AND THE PUBLIC\nSHOCK WHEN RISK AND DANGER SHOW THEMSELVES AS INJURY AND LOSS\nS OF\nF L\nL\n\"\n\"\nL\nMICHAEL FOALE\nREMARKS\nAT \"\nWHAT\"\nWHAT\nL\"\nLIFE.\"\nLIFE.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nless aware of how great the risk was and found themselves surprised. [slide]\nHere's John Glenn, 20 February 1962, walking out to the first human flight of the\nMercury-Atlas vehicle. John Glenn walked out to a much more risky launch than\nthe one before him by Gus Grissom, which had also been on a Redstone rocket.\nWhy? In my opinion, it's pretty clear. Because the vehicle had been changed.\nThe mission was very different. Launched to orbit with 3 times the speed of the\nRedstone, 10 times the energy to gain getting into orbit, and 10 times the energy\nto dissipate in excess heat reentering from orbit.\nThis is the basic fact of the physics of spaceflight into orbit and away from\nthe Earth. The energies needed to be acquired or dissipated are huge, roughly 300\ntimes the kinetic energy of airliners, 290 that of supersonic jets, 25 times that of\nSpaceShipOne this week, on which I, personally, pin much hope, and I think the\nrest of you do, also.\nWas this huge difference compared to Alan Shepherd's flight understood\nby the public? Kennedy did say only later that year, in September, \"We choose to\ngo to the Moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy,\nbut because they are hard.\"\n[slide] When Gus Grissom and John Young walked out, in March 1965, to\nGemini 3, the risks were again increased, in my opinion. It was a new human\nlaunch vehicle, a first flight for humans, and it was a new, larger spacecraft,\nthe Gemini capsule. On the previous rockets, there was an escape tower. The\ncrew escape system was reduced in this case--ejection seats--diminishing its\ncapability compared to Mercury. It was a big, risky step for our nation's space\nprogram, but probably not perceived [as so] by the public.\n[slide] This is Ed White on the first U.S. spacewalk--definitely a new risk\nin our space program, adding to others as a first-time test.\n[slide] Here's Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott docking with the Agena upper\nstage, only to experience high rotation rates when they docked. They undocked\nand experienced even worse rotation rates, tumbling. They saved themselves\nby switching to a different attitude control jet system and made an emergency\nsplashdown thousands of miles from the planned recovery area.\nSo the risk of human space exploration then, in this program up to that\npoint, had been successful. Shows itself as a real hazard, but in NASA parlance,\nwe call that a close call. It's where we go, \"Whew! That was dangerous,\" breathe a\nsigh of relief, but nobody lost their life.\n[slide] The death of the Apollo 1 crew--Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger\nChaffee--in January 1967, in a fire inside the command module while on the\nlaunch pad, pulled NASA and the Nation up short. But the tragedy brought the\nbest out in NASA and the Nation at that time, with new public resolve and tough\nlessons learned.\n[slide] Two years later, an incredibly bold and risky decision was made\nby George [Mueller] and others to send Apollo 8 to the Moon after only one\nmanned Apollo flight. Jim Lovell talked about that this morning. I think it is an\nincredible flight, especially risky because they did not take a lunar module with\n\nthem, which, because of its independent systems as a spacecraft in its own right,\nmitigated for future Apollo missions the risk of command-module failure.\n[slide] Apollo 11 was well-perceived by the public to be risky. I think failure\nwould have been tragic, in their minds, and awful, but not a shock. There was the\nunknown risk of landing on the lunar surface, plus the high risk of the Apollo\nsystem as a whole, but, so far, successfully flown. I remember as a young boy of\nabout 12 or 13, the success made me sigh with relief, as if the risk had somehow\ngone away at that point.\nThe reward for the United States, for the Nation, when we are willing to\ntake risks and to explore, is really so obvious in lunar rendezvous; the liftoff\nfrom the lunar surface with just one engine--only one engine to get you into\norbit--carried a whole other set of risks with it.\nAnd then we come to Jim Lovell's flight with Apollo 13. Its emergency was\nmore of a type--in my mind, Jim--that NASA actually expects and tries to plan\nfor. Risk again showed itself as real. I've wondered how I might have felt leaving\nthe Earth when the accident happened.\nAs he pointed out, it was a fortuitous place--200,000 miles from the\nMoon--from his point of view. But, in my case, I think of not being able to turn\naround as the power systems of their command module failed. I think of what\nthe cold, dead spacecraft may have seemed like when I was on Mir, when we lost\nenergy, lost power, without a single sound and no power and the cold of space\nsucking the heat out of the spacecraft and yourself and your crewmates. It's a\nvery, very hard task dealing with a dying spacecraft because it gets so cold and so\nwet. For Apollo 13, the risk was seen to be a close call. I don't mean to diminish\nthat, Jim Lovell, but it was a close call because we pulled it off--you pulled it\noff--no one died, thanks to thousands of people on Earth and your crew.\n[slide] STS-1, with John Young and Bob Crippen. This was the first powered\nflight of a Space Shuttle. I feel this was the boldest, riskiest flight in NASA's history.\nBut if you mention that to John, he just seems to mutter some understatement\ncharacteristic of only John Young. The launch involved three characteristically\ndifferent components to work perfectly and all together for the first time in\na manned test. These were the external tank, the solid rocket boosters, and the\norbiter. And within these, the main components--engines, hydraulic power units,\nfuel cells--all had to work reliably, but at least these had been tested in an integrated\nfashion before powered flight. This was not true of all three components together.\nNo unmanned flight of the STS had been conducted. And the buildup to STS-1 was\nslow and difficult for NASA, so the public heard about its risk in the press as much\nbecause it had been so long since the last manned launch of Apollo to Skylab. For all\nthat risk, the crew escape system--ejection seats--was especially limited compared\nto that of Apollo, adding even greater risk to the crew for this first flight.\nBut STS-1 was a success, as were subsequent flights up to the 25th,\nChallenger. The ejection seats were removed. Our public and NASA seemed to\nexpect space exploration to be like that of airline operations. And to be fair to the\npublic, this is an understandable misconception.\nMICHAEL FOALE\nREMARKS\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nOnly recently--just two weeks ago when I was climbing Mt. Baker--we\nwere discussing the loss of Columbia with people who do not work in the space\nprogram. And the genuine question goes, \"After all, the Shuttle lands like an\nairliner, right? So it must be as risk-free as an airliner. You spent all that money on\nit.\" I've heard this from generally well-informed people in different professions.\nSo the public is especially shocked when the Shuttle is destroyed.\nOkay, so why do astronaut applications to NASA actually increase after\nwe've had a disaster, including me in 1981, watching STS-1 from Cambridge,\nEngland, driven to become an astronaut. Would-be astronauts do risky things to\nacquire the skills of explorers--I think Bill Stone overdid it this morning--such\nas fly gliders or scuba dive on expeditions in Greece; this is something I thought\nwas really captivating and interesting. Or excavating human remains in the low\nvisibility and cold conditions on the Mary Rose in the English Channel. There\nwas risk in these exploration activities for me and the two people who preceded\nme. Two people had died in the course of many dives on the Mary Rose [before I\njoined the] project. But the excitement of discovering new things was compelling\nand it pushed me to do more.\n[slide] Becoming an astronaut in Group 15 in 1987, after Challenger. Yeah,\nyou'll recognize some characters here, it's an in-crowd, but it was a result of my\ndesire not to take risk, but to experience space exploration. My desire outweighed\nthe risk I perceived, a risk greater than I probably realized at the time.\n[slide] This is astronaut spaceflight readiness training, and it carries risk.\nWe may have to eject out of a T-38 or be picked up by helicopter in search-and-\nrescue exercises. Or--this is not hazardous--overeat during a survival exercise.\nBut these training activities to prepare astronauts are undertaken to reduce our\nfuture risks during space missions.\nSo our training carries risk also, and this is to be balanced carefully with the\nhigher risks that we are trying to mitigate in the conduct of our space missions. Our\nremote outdoor expedition training is a key to preparing crew members to make use\nof local resources, solve technical and mechanical failures in difficult conditions.\n[slide] Here John Young and Charlie Duke are being trained in geology to\nincrease the science return of Apollo 16, which was highly successful. I believe\nwe need to place future exploration astronauts into geology field work, in a long-\nduration expedition context, as part of scientific expeditions where scientists\nhave a stake in these activities of the astronauts. So the astronauts feel the\npressure that stake has on them, [as] for example, searching for and recognizing\nMartian meteorites in the deserts or in Antarctica.\nPost-Challenger, my first flight was on STS-45 in 1992. And my family\ntook the risk very seriously, as the families of all astronauts do, as did my first\ncommander--Charlie Bolden. And he was already a three-time flyer, I think, at\nthat point. And he strongly encouraged me--and I was a bit surprised by this--\nto write a will. It was honest advice for a risk-taker from a risk-taker.\nNASA managers work to the very best of their ability to manage our risk\nwhen we fly, but they are limited to the tools at hand, the architecture of the\n\nMISSIONS. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIFIED AS THAT MISSION UNFOL\nLLOY\nINK.\nINK.\nSpace Shuttle system, and the inherent risk in all launch systems attempting\norbital speeds.\nIn the late 1990s, NASA was directed to work with the Russian Space Agency\nto build the International Space Station (ISS), providing sustaining financial\nsupport to, at that time, a Russian space industry in severe difficulty. And it\njump-started the redesign of the ISS and initiated a series of joint Shuttle-Mir\nmissions throughout which a NASA astronaut would be left aboard the Mir to\ngain experience in the conduct of long-duration space flight.\n[slide] So here a few of us and our Russian support staff are gathered in front\nof Yuri Gagarin's statue in Star City. As Charlie Precourt and our crew brought me\ntowards Mir in 1997, I was anxious actually not about the risk, not for my safety,\nbut my ability simply to interact well with my Russian hosts, my cosmonaut crew.\nThe launch was behind me, and I reckoned the on-orbit phase should be less risky.\nLloyd's of London must have thought the same, because they charged me the\nsame $1,500 for mission life insurance, just as they had for my shorter Shuttle\nmissions. They would have been horrified as that mission unfolded, I think.\nThe risk of the U.S. working with Russia in the conduct of these expeditions\nwas that the two sides did not, and could not reasonably, know everything about\neach other's decisions and processes. I certainly did not know or understand that\nwell at the time. A lesson learned during this program was that we are obliged to\nknow as much as possible about each other's operations that carry risks.\nJerry Linenger, who I was replacing, happened to tell me in the handover a\nhairy story about a manual Progress docking attempt, which Vasili Tsibliev had\nbeen instructed to carry out earlier and which, in the end, failed, finishing in a\nclose call, a fly by of the station. I listened attentively, but did not know how to\ncalibrate it as a risk. At any rate, I considered the presence of an independent\nspace vehicle--the Soyuz--to be sufficient to insure our lives in the event of\nbad events on the space station. And, as it would turn out, we came very close to\ntesting my supposition.\nI'm going to show you, very briefly, a clip of a collision of a Progress vehicle\nthat took place while I was on board the space station Mir in 1997. Before the\nactual collision takes place in this video, I will show you the way this docking\nattempt should have taken place. There you will see a Progress vehicle coming\nin towards the space station, towards the docking axis. And it will dock in a\nD'S OF LONDON MUST HAVE THOUGHT THE SAME, BECAUSE THEY CHARGED ME THE\nSAME $1,500 FOR MISSION LIFE INSURANCE, JUST AS THEY HAD FOR MY SHORTER SHUTTLE\nMISSIONS. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIFIED AS THAT MISSION UNFOLDED, , I I TH\nH\n\"\n\"\nMICHAEL FOALE\nREMARKS\nYD\"\nLLOY\"\nLLOY\nH\"\nHINK.\"\nHINK.\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nnominal fashion, stopping at about 100 meters, and then the crew takes over,\nusing manual controls.\nIn this successful attempt, carried out by Anatoly Soloviev and Pavel\nVinogradov, that I witnessed actually later on in that year, they were using all of\nthe full capabilities of the Progress docking system--the range and range rate,\nthe radar system--that allow a normal automatic docking to take place. Vasili\nTsibliev, my commander in Mir 23, had been asked to turn off that equipment--\nnot use it. Why? Because the program in Russia wanted to cut the cost of buying\na $2 million electronic box in the Ukraine. That was the rationale for this test. As\nit unfolded, and as I learned about it, I realized this was a gross miscalculation of\nwhat we were ready to do that day, and it was very improperly thought through\n[about] how to carry out this docking test.\n[video] The sound you hear is in the Soyuz as I was flying around in\nthere looking at the damage, actually. This is the docking module that we're\ntalking about--the docking core. Here's Anatoly monitoring the TORU docking\nequipment. And he sees the Mir in his sights as he flies the Progress manually,\nlooking through a camera from the Progress towards the Mir.\nThis now is the scene as Vasili saw it. We'd already gotten too high above\nthe Mir. You can see the solar arrays of the Mir here, this is the long axis. I snuck\nthis video, by the way, which is why it's such poor quality. They didn't know I\ntook it. And the docking was along this axis, it was meant to be. You can see\nwe're high above the Mir. Vasili is not really saying anything in this audio yet. I'm\njust watching over his shoulder. Sasha is nearby. We should be docking on this\naxis, but we're now moving this way.\nSasha is saying, \"You should move out.\" Sasha is saying, \"Break out! Break\nout!\" He says to me, \"Get to the spacecraft.\" This is my feet coming by the scene\nhere. And then, that's the crash as the Progress hits. At this point, I'm floating\ninto the space towards the Soyuz and the pressure's already falling, I can feel the\npressure, in my ears falling.\nThis is the classic klaxon that you hear when you have a loss of pressure.\nAfterwards, when we did the survey, flying around in the Soyuz spacecraft, we\nlooked at the damage and we saw that the solar array had been badly crashed.\nAfter big events--after risk--you relax. And I wanted to show you what the\nhandover's mood looked like as we finished up. After that pretty terrible day for\nVasili Tsibliev and the rest of us, but particularly bad for the commander who\nsuffered the stigma of this collision, every day we would look out of the window\nat this scene.\nThe damage to the Spektr module was serious, and it broke the foundation\nof that solar array that comes in here towards the Spektr module--so much [so]\nthat I feel that the bearing was the location of the breach in the hull or [the]\nleaks. And Anatoly Soloviev and I did a space walk in Russian suits to survey the\ndamage and try to find a hole, but we were not successful.\nMore serious and risky were the successive--and this takes me back to Jim\nLovell's experience--times when we would lose complete attitude control of the\n\nspace station and tumble slowly. When we had isolated that module--the Spektr\nmodule, Sasha and I--after the collision, we had cut off 30 percent of the Mir's\npower supply in so doing. And so now, the Mir was in a very critical energy state.\nActually, orienting the Mir using the Soyuz, which was the way we did this\nto overcome the loss of attitude control, always made me nervous that we would\nhave inadvertently stabilized it in a spin, so stable that we would forever be stuck\nin it and direct the arrays away from the Sun and then, therefore, kill the station.\n[slide] This is for John Grunsfeld. To put risk on Mir in perspective, I have to\nadd that the risk of a Space Shuttle flight, for me, after the Mir, was just as real to\nme. It was while participating in a Hubble repair mission--with John Grunsfeld,\nby the way, over here--on STS-103 in 1999, commanded by Kurt Brown, that\nI felt the most anxious about what we're planning to do. And the task simply\nwas performance anxiety for me. To change out the brain, the\nmain computer, of the telescope--that made me more nervous\nthat day, about my own performance and the risk of my actions,\nthan anything I have ever experienced in all of six space missions.\nTo leave Hubble worse off than we had found it, now that was a\nnightmare I did not ever want to contemplate.\nComing back to Russia again, NASA's experience on Mir,\nI believe, went a long way to reducing risk in working with the\nRussians on the International Space Station. We gained insight\ninto their commissions and launch decision-making processes.\n[slide] So here you see me. I want to show you, this is\nthe management point of view, and it's a serious one of launch\nreadiness. Ten days before launch on that Soyuz TMA-3 in October\nof last year, I am being presented as kind of an item--Exhibit\nA--to the Russian commission. Not only as a risk-taker, but as a\nform of risk mitigation. The argument was presented, in front of\nme and my crew, by Star City that our training was complete and\nsufficient and so, therefore, our performance did not represent a\nrisk to the completion of Expedition 8. It was kind of a unique\nsituation to be in for me.\nAs we approached the time of departure from Star City to\nthe launch site in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, my family--Rhonda, Ian,\nand Jenna, and those are my crewmates, Aleksandr Kaleri and\nPedro Duque--were toasted very seriously by the Russians and\nthoughtfully, acknowledging the unspoken risks in front of us as we embarked on\nExpedition 8. At this point, no one talks about risk.\n[slide] I'm going to show you the walk out from the suit-up building in\nKazakhstan out to our designated squares, and then the salute, and then on\nto the launch pad for a Soyuz launch. On the way out to a Shuttle launch, you\nbecome introspective, somewhat, as you notice all the other vehicles for a Shuttle\nlaunch are leaving. On the way out to a Russian launch, I'm always amazed that\nin Kazakhstan, when you get to the base of the rocket, you're surrounded by\nAstronaut Michael Foale, Expedition 8\ncommander and NASA's science officer on\nthe International Space Station, gives thumbs\nup after he and his crewmates successfully\nlanded in north central Kazakhstan on\n30 April 2004 in their Soyuz TMA-3 capsule.\n(NASA Image # JSC2004-E-21242)\nMICHAEL FOALE\nREMARKS\n\n\"\nj\nhundreds of senior figures and VIPs, and they're all clamoring to be there, right\nnext to a steaming, hissing, breathing rocket. I guess they want to take part in the\nsame risk as we three have to at that point in the launch sequence.\nAt this point, though, they've moved everybody away. The ride is incredible.\nI don't know how to describe it. There's a lot of rumbling noise, vibration. Very\nabrupt cutoffs as we go through staging, and then there's peace and quiet when you\nget to orbit. And all the hoopla you went through getting to the launch pad is kind\nof behind you.\nYou think about, if you have a reflective moment, your family back at the\nlaunch pad, thousands of miles away already.\nIf you were to watch the faces of launch teams at Cape Canaveral, and the\nmanagers, you would find expressions of concern and nervousness and prayer\nand hope written all over their faces. At this moment, if people have forgotten\nthe risk of the launch, then they remember it.\nOn board, it's more simple. Crew members have to only perform reliably and\ncarefully. In my mind, once embarked on a risky phase, be it crossing a crevice\nfield on a glacier or carrying out procedures using dynamic operations in a space\nvehicle, at that point, you have to stop worrying and move on to minimize the\nrisk of your own failure. That's the risk-taker's point of view.\nOf course, there's time to relax sometimes, such as New Year. A long-\nduration mission is very much an act of endurance and perseverance. The risk\nI take most seriously is being part of a crew that cannot shift out of relaxation\nfrom routine to operational readiness for dynamic operations. An example of\nthat would be shifting to operational readiness for reentry in a space vehicle after\nyou've spent 194 days in space.\nThis transition for our crew, including a long-time unseen flight engineer,\nwas probably the greatest risk we were exposed to during this otherwise pretty\nnominal expedition. The ride is incredible. From four hours ago, [when] we\nwere enjoying chocolate and drinks, and then, after a deorbit burn, pyro belts\nfiring, tumbling, the shock of parachute opening, rapid depressurization of the\nspacecraft, and then the smell of cordite coming in through the vents of the\nspacecraft into the cabin; finally, you touch down onto the Kazakhstan plain.\n[video] He's saying, \"I congratulate you. This is the hole made by a thruster\nmade on the Soyuz spacecraft as it did the braking burn.\nAfter the risk is past, crew members, family, space managers, all of us are\nrelieved, and we celebrate how we have cheated death once more. It shows in our\nfaces that the risk of spaceflight and space exploration is always present, and\nwe must always be honest about it, explain it, and do our utmost to reduce it,\nwithout hiding it. That way, when we risk-takers are back with our families and\nwe talk about committing to new space exploration--she says, \"Don't you dare\nfly again!\" [ oking] No, you talk about it. Nobody should ever, ever be shocked if,\nin taking those steps, we should falter and not return home.\nExploration today carries risk just as dangerous as it did in history. I believe\nwe must honestly explain that risk, just as we move forward to carry out the\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\n\nPresident's space exploration vision. Americans can suffer discomfort, hardship,\nand overcome the greatest difficulties when the goals and risks are laid out plainly\nside by side. We must take on these most challenging adventures, while looking\ninto the face of risk. In that way, we will achieve some incredible things in space.\nYou've listened this evening to me and the excellent discussion today.\nPlease continue to let me and us know what you, the public, and our\nCongress, think about risk-taking in space exploration. Thank you for being here\nthis evening.\n■\nBack to Contents page\nMICHAEL FOALE\nREMARKS\n\nAbout the Editors\nSteven J. Dick is the chief historian for NASA. He has a B.S. in astrophysics\n(1971), and an M.A. and Ph.D. (1977) in history and philosophy of science from Indiana\nUniversity. Dick worked as an astronomer and historian of science at the U. S. Naval\nObservatory in Washington, D.C. for 24 years before coming to NASA Headquarters\nin 2003. Among his books are Plurality of Worlds: The Origins of the Extraterrestrial Life\nDebate from Democritus to Kant (1982), The Biological Universe: The Twentieth Century\nExtraterrestrial Life Debate and the Limits of Science (1996), and Life on Other Worlds\n(1998), the latter translated into Chinese, Italian, Czech, and Polish. His most recent\nbooks are The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology (2004) and\na comprehensive history of the U. S. Naval Observatory, Sky and Ocean Joined: The U. S.\nNaval Observatory, 1830-2000 (2003). The latter received the Pendleton Prize of the\nSociety for History in the Federal Government. He is also editor of Many Worlds:\nThe New Universe, Extraterrestrial Life and the Theological Implications (2000). Dick is\nthe recipient of the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Medal and the NASA Group\nAchievement Award for his role in NASA's multidisciplinary program in astrobiology.\nHe has served as chairman of the Historical Astronomy Division of the American\nAstronomical Society, as president of the History of Astronomy Commission of\nthe International Astronomical Union, and is the immediate past president of the\nPhilosophical Society of Washington.\nKeith L. Cowing is the editor of the online publications NASA Watch and\nSpaceRef.com. He received both a B.A. (1984) and M.A. (1987) in biology from Central\nConnecticut State University. Cowing is the coauthor (with Frank Sietzen, Jr.) of\nNew Moon Rising (2004) which examines the events leading up to the formulation of\nthe Vision for Space Exploration as put forth by President Bush. Cowing has served\nas guest editor of Ad Astra Magazine, written for United Press International, and\nAir&Space Magazine (among others), and appeared on all major U.S. television and\nradio networks as a commentator on space policy and technology. Prior to being\nan online journalist, Cowing was a NASA civil servant and served as manager of\nPressurized Payload Accommodations at the NASA Space Station Freedom Program\nOffice. Prior to, and immediately after, working for NASA, Cowing was employed\nby the American Institute of Biological Sciences where he managed a series of large\nbiomedical peer review activities for NASA and the U.S. Army. Cowing has been a\nparticipant in the NASA Haughton Mars Project located on Devon Island, Nunavut,\nCanada. Together with his business partner Marc Boucher, SpaceRef Interactive\ndonated and constructed the Arthur Clarke Mars Greenhouse, now in operating on\nDevon Island. Cowing was also part of the early organizational meetings that led\nto the establishment of NASA's astrobiology program and the NASA Astrobiology\nInstitute. Cowing helped to organize the symposium and donated his services in the\npreparation of these proceedings.\nBack to Contents page\n\nIndex\nA\nAccidents in North American Mountaineering, 211\nAgena, 260\nAdvance Base, 31\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys, 215\nAlbertson, Ray, 179\nAllen, Paul, 38\nAlvin (American submersible), 103\nAmes Research Center, 24, 46, 65, 81, 229, 238, 242\nAmundsen, Roald, 22-23, 28, 29-30, 37, 49\nAnnapurna, 49\nAndersen, Dale, 43-48, 67, 86, 88, 236\nAndrea Doria, 98\nAndrews, David, 188, 193\nAntarctica, 23, 25, 33, 43-47, 101, 170, 222, 258, 262; dry valleys, 44-46\nApollo program, 56, 93, 147, 153, 154, 155, 157, 167, 169, 189, 193, 199, 221, 226, 227,\n240, 253, 260, 261\nApollo 1 (Apollo 204), 39, 187, 188; fire, 188-191, 260\nApollo 7, 13, 18\nApollo 8, 12-13, 17, 18, 36\nApollo 9, 18, 193\nApollo 10, 18, 19\nApollo 11, 14, 18, 260\nApollo 12, 14-15, 18\nApollo 13, 15-20, 36, 82, 99, 128, 151, 156, 194, 220, 252, 261; lessons learned, 19\nApollo 14, 36\nApollo 15, 193\nApollo 16, 262\nApollo 17, 154\nApollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP), 156\nAquarius Laboratory, 221\nArctic, 47, 101, 210\nArmstrong, Neil, 130, 195, 260\nAsrar, Ghassem, 239\nAssembly Test and Launch Operations (ATLO), 178\nAsteroids, 200\nAstrobiology, 46, 55, 61-64, 124, 247\nAtlas launch vehicle, 250, 260\nAustralasian-Antarctic Expedition, 29\nAverner, Mel, 235, 248\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nB\nBeagle\nBeagle II\nC\nBachelard, Claude, 35\nBalboa, Vasco Nunez de, 131\nBarney, Mitch, 202\nBarton, Otis, 102\nBathyscaphe, 102-103\n, voyage of, 28\n(mission), 168\nBeebe, William, 102\nBelgian Antarctic Expedition, 28-29\nBelgica, 28\nBergreen, Laurence, 129-138\nBig Bang, 184\nBismarck (ship), 123\nBolden, Charles, 262\nBorman, Frank, 12, 188-191, 198\nBoston, Penny, 55-60, 67, 87-88, 94, 147, 173\nBowersox, Ken, 26\nBoynton, Bill, 246\nBreashears, David, 83\nBritish trans-Antarctic Expedition, 30\nBrown, Kurt, 265\nBudden, Nancy Ann, 236\nBunger Hills, Antarctica, 46-47\nBurns, Ed, 77\nBurton, Kathleen, 248\nBush, President George W., 10, 236\nBush, President George H.W., 236\nByrd, Richard, 31\nC-141 Starlifter, 46\nCabana, Robert, 210\nCabrol, Nathalie, 61-68, 88, 231, 232, 234, 246\nCalypso (ship), 7\nCameron, James, 119-128, 140, 143, 145, 148, 154; Ghosts of the Abyss,\nCantrell, Walter, 217\nCape of the Feast of the 11,000 Virgins, 133\nCape Canaveral, 160, 173, 175, 266\nCape Crozier, 79\nCarlin, George, 192-193\n\nINDEX\nCarter, Jimmy, 155, 156\nCartography, 134\nCassini (mission), 151, 235\nCauffman, Sandra, 231\nCaves, 55-60; organisms in, 58-59; underwater, 69-75\nCepollina, Frank, 214\nCeres, 200\nChafee, Roger, 189, 190, 260\nChaikin, Andrew, 187\nChallenger (ship), 102\nChallenger Space Shuttle, 39, 183, 204; accident, 182, 192, 193, 194, 198, 200, 224,\n261, 262; TV movie, 198\nChandra X-ray Observatory, 151\nChatterton, John, 97-100, 140, 146; Shadow Divers, 99\nCherry-Garrard, Apsley, 23, 78-79\nChina: and exploration in 15th century, 7, 34, 232\nChina: space program, 145\nChristensen, Rho, 248\nClancy, Bill, 238\nClarke, Arthur C., 34\nClementine (lunar mission), 154\nClosed loop ecosystems, 146\nCOBE--Cosmic Background Explorer, 181-186, 204\nCollins, Eileen, 217\nColumbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), 2, 7, 198, 202, 212-213, 214, 230\nColumbia Space Shuttle accident, ix, 7-8, 39, 191, 198, 200, 213, 214, 225, 262;\ncompared to Titanic disaster, 122-123\nColumbia Hills, 173, 210\nColumbus, Christopher, 22, 24-25, 102, 131, 132, 133, 141, 258\nCommand Service Module (Apollo), 12, 13, 15, 17, 19\nCommunications, 36\nCongress: United States, 86, 157, 209, 218, 230\nCook, Frederick, 28\nCook, Captain James, 136\nCook, Steve, 82\nCorps of Discovery, 26-27\nCortez, Hernando, 37\nCosmic Origins Spectrograph, 216\nCousteau, Jacques, 7, 106, 108, 109, 210\nCousteau, Jean-Michel, 107-110, 139, 140, 210\nCowing, Keith, 3, 90, 91, 229, 236, 237, 238, 247\nCueva Cheve, 70-76\nCueva de Villa Luz, 59\n\nRISK AND EXPLORATION: EARTH, SEA AND THE STARS\nD\nE\nBeagle\nda Gama, Vasco, 3, 131\nDarabont, Frank, 188\nDarwin, Charles, 28\nDawn (mission), 200\nDecompression illness/sickness (DCI/DCS), 92, 98, 111-114, 116-118, 139\nDeep rover submersible, 124\nDeepworker submersible, 105\nDelta launch vehicle, 182, 183, 247\nDenali (Mt.

      "content": "BOLD ENDEAVORS: BEHAVIORAL LESSONS FROM POLAR AND SPACE EXPLORATION\nJack W. Stuster\nAnacapa Sciences, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA\nABSTRACT\nAnecdotal comparisons frequently are made between\nexpeditions of the past and space missions of the future.\nSpacecraft are far more complex than sailing ships, but\nfrom a psychological perspective, the differences are few\nbetween confinement in a small wooden ship locked in the\npolar ice cap and confinement in a small high-technology\nship hurtling through interplanetary space. This paper\ndiscusses some of the behavioral lessons that can be\nlearned from previous expeditions and applied to facilitate\nh uman adjustment and performance during future space\nexpeditions of long duration.\nIn many ways, the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1898\nto 1899 was a precursor of things to come. It was the first\nexpedition to camp, although briefly, on the Antarctic continent,\nand the first to spend an entire year locked in its icy embrace.\nMost important was the international composition of its crew--\neighteen men isolated together in one of the most challenging\nenvironments on Earth. In an era when expeditions were\nexpressions of nationalistic tendencies, the cosmopolitan\nmakeup of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition was truly modern,\nconsisting of nine Belgians, six Norwegians, two Poles, a\nRomanian, and an American, the ship's physician, Dr. Frederick\nA. Cook.\nDr. Cook had responded to a newspaper advertisement\nthat was placed when the expedition's original physician backed\nout only a few days before the ship sailed. Commandant Adrien\nde Gerlache, organizer of the expedition, selected Cook on the\nbasis of his previous Arctic experience. In October 1897, Cook\njoined the expedition in the roadstead of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nThe Belgica, the expedition's ship, arrived in the Antarctic\nduring January 1898. Though late in the season, the crew was\nable to make several landings to collect geological specimens,\nlichens, moss, and insects. They conducted more scientific work\nthan had any previous Antarctic expedition, but they probably\nspent too much time on shore. In March, the ship became\ntrapped in the frozen Bellinghausen Sea and, locked in by pack\nice, drifted there for more than a year. The crew was not fully\nprepared for the experience.\nThe medical officers of polar expeditions, and later at\nAntarctic research stations, usually experienced considerable\nfrustration because they found few professional duties to\nperform. However, this was not to be the case for Dr. Cook. The\nthirty-two-year-old physician was occupied during the\nremainder of the expedition with a problem that started when the\nship became locked in the ice and grew increasingly acute\nthroughout the long winter night: almost every member of\nMaterial in this article was drawn from several chapters of the\nauthor's book, Bold Endeavors: Lessons from Polar and Space\nExploration. (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press. 1996).\nthe crew gradually became afflicted with a strange and persistent\nmelancholy. As the weeks blended one into another, the\ncondition deepened into depression and then despair.\nEventually, crew members lost almost all motivation and found\nit difficult to concentrate or even to eat. One man weakened and\ndied of a heart ailment that Cook believed was caused, at least in\npart, by his terror of the darkness. Another crewman became\nobsessed with the notion that others intended to kill him; when\nhe slept, he squeezed himself into a small recess in the ship so\nthat he could not easily be found. Yet another man succumbed to\nhysteria that rendered him temporarily deaf and unable to speak.\nAdditional members of the crew were disturbed in other ways. It\nwas to this dismal condition that Roald Amundsen referred when\nhe later wrote, \"Insanity and disease stalked the decks of the\nBelgica that winter.\"\nDr. Cook believed the malady was caused more by lack of\nlight than by the scurvy they were experiencing. Whatever the\nactual cause, it is clear that the problem was also psychological.\nThe dreaded polar night is not really that dreadful3⁄4it has been\nendured without ill effects by many explorers and countless\nindigenous inhabitants of the Arctic regions3⁄4but it took a\nterrible toll on the crew of the Belgica. The men suffered from\npoor circulation, heart troubles, and impaired digestion. Their\ndiet was low in fiber and probably certain vitamins. Although\nvitamins had not been discovered yet, Dr. Cook believed that the\ndiet lacked some important element. He attempted to remedy the\ncondition by encouraging the men to eat fresh penguin meat, but\nmany found it unpalatable. He also prescribed an exercise\nprogram to counter growing symptoms of insanity among the\ncrew, but walks on the ice devolved into a circular path around\nthe ship that came to be known as the \"madhouse promenade.\"\nCook's journal entries reflect the depression into which this\nsmall society had fallen. The following is an example:\nThe darkness grows daily a little deeper, and\nthe night soaks hourly a little more color\nfrom our blood. Our gait is now careless, the\nstep non-elastic, the foothold uncertain . . . .\nMost of us in the cabin have grown\ndecidedly gray within two months, though\nfew are over thirty. Our faces are drawn, and\nthere is an absence of jest and cheer and\nhope in our make-up which, in itself, is one\nof the saddest incidents in our existence. . . .\nThe novelty of life has been worn out. . . .\nWe miss the usual poetry and adventure of\nhome on winter nights. We miss the flushed\nmaidens, the jingling bells, the spirited\nhorses, the inns, the crackling blaze of the\ncountry fire. We miss much of life which\nmakes it worth the trouble of existence.\n(Cook [1900] 1980, 319)\nGravitational and Space Biology Bulletin 13(2), June 2000 49\n\nBEHAVIORAL LESSONS FROM POLAR AND SPACE EXPLORATION\nIn desperation, Cook devised a method that he called the\n\"baking treatment,\" in which the most seriously ill sat with\ntheir bodies exposed to the warm glow of the ship's stove for\nan hour each day. This therapy, combined with enforced\nportions of fresh penguin meat, seemed to help, but Cook\nobserved that \"surely one of the most important things was to\nraise the patients' hopes and instill a spirit of good humor\"\n(Cook [1900] 1980). This he did consciously and persistently\nthroughout the remainder of the expedition.\nThe crew's spirits began to improve in the spring, but the\nice floe that trapped the Belgica gave no indication that it\nwould ever break up. It was necessary to escape the Antarctic\nbecause, as each man knew, to stay another year would be\nfatal. Laboring with large ice saws, axes, and explosives, the\ncrew eventually blasted the ship free, but the Belgica did not\nreach open water for another month. In November 1899, the\nship arrived in Europe, where crew members were greeted as if\nthey had been to the moon and back.\nFrederick Cook described life onboard the Belgica as a\n\"hellish existence,\" but he rose to the occasion and is credited\nwith saving the expedition from psychological disaster.\nThe cause of the malady that affected the Belgian\nAntarctic Expedition remains a mystery. The diet and lack of\nsunlight could have caused anemia and depression, as Cook\nsurmised, or perhaps the crew suffered from a shared\nhysterical reaction or some other psychological group\nphenomenon. Simple boredom and depression may have\naffected all the members of the party and driven some beyond\nthe limits of their endurance. Like most complex phenomena,\nthe crew's experience was probably caused by a combination\nof factors. Certainly it was of considerable relevance to plans\nfor future long-duration expeditions.\nIt is increasingly difficult for people to imagine what life\nwas like in the closing years of the 19th century. Today we\ntake for granted the air transportation network and wireless\ncommunications that cover the globe, but much of Earth was\nstill inaccessible in the 1800s. The polar regions were among\nthe most consuming mysteries of the natural world yet to be\nexplained. No one knew what conditions to expect--whether\nland, ice, or sea covered the poles.\nMany efforts had been made to reach the farthest north.\nMost notably, in 1845, the British Admiralty dispatched Sir\nJohn Franklin to locate and navigate the Northwest Passage,\nand it was assumed that Franklin and his carefully selected\nparty would succeed where others had failed. Two ships, the\nErebus and the Terror, were loaded with supplies to\nsupport a crew of 129 for four years. After departing England,\nthey hailed a group of whalers off Greenland on their course\nnorth, then vanished without a trace.\nDuring most of the next two decades, polar exp loration\nwas dedicated to finding and, perhaps, rescuing any survivors\nof the Franklin Expedition. Among the attempts was an\nAmerican expedition, thirty-one men commanded by young\nLieutenant George Washington De Long, that sailed onboard\nthe Jeannette out of San Francisco Bay on 8 July 1879.\nTelegraph Hill and the Embarcadero swarmed with well-\nwishers, and more were afloat on the yachts, tugs, and\nlaunches that filled the bay as the barque-rigged coal burner\nsteamed through the Golden Gate and set a course for the\nArctic. Two months later, the Jeannette was beset by ice\nand trapped, as the Erebus and the Terror and countless\nother ships had been over the centuries. The crew stayed with\nthe ship for nearly two years until she was crushed, then\nmade their way to shore and through the Siberian wilderness.\nOnly thirteen men survived the ordeal.\nThree years after De Long and his party abandoned their\nship, pieces of the Jeannette's wreckage were found on the\nsouthwest coast of Greenland, thousands of miles from where,\ncrushed by the ice, she had sunk. This information contributed\nto a theory that the far north was covered with ice, and that\nthis ice cap moved in a westerly direction across the Arctic.\nDr. Fridtjof Nansen, a young scientist, outdoorsman, and\ncurator at Christiania University, developed a bold plan to\ntest the hypothesis. Nansen recently had returned from\nmaking the first successful crossing of the Greenland plateau,\na remarkable accomplishment that would prove to be only a\nprelude to one of the world's boldest endeavors.\nThe genius of Nansen's plan was to build a special ship\nfor the expedition instead of converting an existing vessel.\nThis ship would be designed to rise up out of the ice as the\nfloes pressed against her hull, rather than to resist the full\nforce of the pressure. Critics scoffed at Nansen for his theory\nand predicted that his expedition would end in failure.\nHowever, he persevered and obtained an initial grant from the\nNorwegian government. There were cost overruns, just as\nthere are in modern programs, when the design was changed to\nincrease the ship's capacity and the margin for crew safety.\nThe Fram--the name means \"onward\" in Norwegian--\nwas heavily built, but constructed with no edges below the\nwater line that might give ice a purchase on the ship. The keel\nwas recessed, and all fittings could be removed to create a\nsmooth and rounded profile. Departing the beautiful Hanseatic\nport of Bergen on 1 July 1893, she sailed north and east,\ncrossed the Barents and Kara seas, and skirted the northern\ncoast of Siberia. Three months later, at a point closer to\nAlaska than Norway, she headed into the ice pack, where she\nwas intentionally locked in the ice just north of 78o latitude.\nAs the floes encroached and the forces on the Fram's hull\nincreased, the sturdy little ship rose out of the ice and\nremained cradled above the pressure ridges, drifting with the\nice pack across the top of the world for nearly three years.\nNansen's design worked according to plan, and the theory of\npolar drift was confirmed. When it appeared that the Fram's\ncourse would take her no farther north across the polar ice\ncap, Nansen selected Hjalmar Johansen to accompany him on\na dash to the pole with kayaks, sledges, and dogs.\nGravitational and Space Biology Bulletin 13(2), June 2000\n\nBEHAVIORAL LESSONS FROM POLAR AND SPACE EXPLORATION\nFigure 1. \"Fram in the Ice\" by William Gilkerson, 1894.\n(Courtesy of the author)\nBy 7 April 1895, Nansen and Johansen were making only\na mile headway each day over rough ice, so they turned back at\n86o13' north latitude--160 miles farther north than any explorer\nhad previously achieved. Navigating with erroneous charts and\ncaught by an early winter, they made it to Franz Josef Land and\nbuilt a small hut out of stones and walrus hides, in which they\nwould live in complete isolation and confinement. Life in the six-\nby-ten-foot hut was unpleasant in many ways, not the least\nbeing the decline in personal hygiene they endured because they\nlacked supplies, including fuel for melting snow. For the entire\nnine-month Arctic winter, they cooked their food and\nilluminated their world with the small flame of a blubber lamp,\ncoating the hut and themselves with soot and grease. The best\nway they found to clean themselves, scraping their skin with\ntheir knife blades, produced usable quantities of fuel that they\nrecycled in their lamp. Conditions were about as bad as humans\ncan reasonably endure. Nansen and Johansen's dreams were\nfilled with Turkish baths and visits to clothing stores.\nThe two explorers lived together as one might imagine\nNeolithic hunters who had ventured too far and become stranded\nby an early winter storm; but Nansen and Johansen survived the\nexperience. They suffered from the mind-numbing sameness of\ntheir days and the other health-threatening conditions, but\nemerged from their den early in the spring of 1896 to expertly\nperform all of the technical tasks necessary to fight their way\nthrough pack ice to the safety and comforts of civilization. They\nsurvived the extreme austerity of their life with no apparent ill\neffects, and pressed on eagerly in their kayaks. Walruses\nattacked them, and at one point the explorers nearly lost their\nkayaks and equipment when their small craft drifted away from\nthe ice flow onto which they had climbed. A month after\ndeparting their hut, they encountered the English explorer\nFrederick Jackson in one of history's most remarkable chance\nmeetings. They stayed with the Jackson Expedition nearly two\nmonths, waiting for its relief ship. The day that Nansen and\nJohansen set foot on Norwegian soil, the Fram broke free from\nthe ice on the opposite side of the Arctic and headed for\nSpitzbergen and then Tromso, Norway. Here her crew was\nreunited after seventeen months of separation. A few weeks\nlater, on 9 September 1896, the Fram steamed up Christiania\nFjord three years and three months following her departure.\nNansen and his crew were greeted as if they had just returned\nfrom another planet.\nDuring his isolation and confinement, Fridtjof Nansen\nexperienced a lethargy that was similar to that described a few\nyears later by Dr. Cook of the Belgica. Nansen described his\nfeelings in his journal:\nMy mind is confused; the whole thing has got into a\ntangle; I am a riddle to myself. I am worn out, and\nyet I do not feel any special tiredness. Is it because I\nsat up reading last night? Everything around us is\nemptiness, and my brain is a blank. I look at the\nhome pictures and I am moved by them in a curious,\ndull way; I look into the future, and feel as if it does\nnot much matter to me whether I get home in the\nautumn of this year or next. So long as I get home in\nthe end, a year or two seem almost nothing. I have\nnever thought this before. I have no inclination to\nread, nor to draw, nor to do anything else whatever.\nThe only thing that helps me is writing, trying to\nexpress myself on these pages, and then looking at\nmyself, as it were, from the outside. (Nansen 1897,\nvol. 1, 372-73)\nThanks to better equipment, procedures, leadership, and, most\nimportant, the extensive planning that preceded the Norwegian\nPolar Expedition, the malaise onboard the Fram was short-lived\nand more effectively contained than that suffered by the crew of\nthe Belgica. How did the Norwegian Polar Expedition endure\nmore than three years with scarcely a problem, while the Belgian\nAntarctic Expedition nearly collapsed within its first year?\nThe primary characteristic that distinguished Nansen from\nmost other polar explorers was that he approached all aspects of\nexpedition planning with scientific precision. He started by\nreading accounts of previous expeditions to learn from the\nexperiences of his predecessors. Nansen remarked in his diary\nthat, to his surprise, most of the problems confronting him\nalready had been addressed and, in many instances, solved by\nprevious explorers: wear appropriate clothing, pay special\nattention to the food, select crew members who can get along,\nand keep the crew busy and entertained. Nansen developed\nspecial high-calorie rations and systematically tested every item\nof food; he developed and evaluated sledges, harnesses,\nGravitational and Space Biology Bulletin 13(2), June 2000\n\nBEHAVIORAL LESSONS FROM POLAR AND SPACE EXPLORATION\nprotective clothing, and other equipment; and he invented\nsolutions to equipment problems that still are used by polar\ntravelers. He evenequipped his ship with wind-powered electric\nlights to illuminate the winter darkness at a time when electricity\nwas still a novelty, and he fostered group solidarity with an\negalitarian approach to his crew during an era when expeditions\nwere managed autocratically. Modern exploration really began\nwith Fridtjof Nansen and his Norwegian Polar Expedition. All\nwho came after him benefitted immensely from his experience,\nand his experience is relevant to the full range of behavioral\nissues confronting expedition teams of the future.\nThe Norwegian Polar Expedition provides an appropriate\nmodel for modern explorers in many ways. Nansen's systematic\nsimulation, testing, and evaluation of every item of equipment\nand his meticulous attention to every detail and possible\ncontingency set him apart from all previous and most\nsubsequent explorers. But, most important, Nansen recognized\nthat the physical and psychological well-being of his crew could\nmake the difference between success and failure. Accordingly, he\nprovided a well-designed habitat, insightful procedures, and\nexceptional leadership to a qualified and compatible crew. \"The\nhuman factor is three quarters of any expedition,\" wrote Roald\nAmundsen, the most successful of all explorers. Before\nAmundsen, Nansen knew that human factors were the critical\ncomponent in any expedition; in Nansen's words, \"It is the man\nthat matters.\"\nDespite superficial similarities to other space missions and\nEarth-bound analogues, lunar and Martian missions--involving\nextended durations and astronomical distances--will be far more\ndifficult and dangerous. Crowded conditions, logistics and\nequipment problems, radiation concerns, communication lag\ntimes, workloads, language and cultural differences, and a variety\nof other issues will conspire to impair the performance and\naffect the behavior of crew personnel. Above all stressors,\nhowever, the long durations of missions will impose the greatest\nburdens and extract the most severe tolls on the humans\ninvolved. On long-duration space missions, time is likely to be\nthe factor that will compound all issues, however trivial, into\nserious problems.\nAnecdotal comparisons frequently are made between\nfuture space missions and expeditions of the past. From an\nengineering perspective, spacecraft are far more complex than\nsailing ships, and one of the factors that drives spacecraft\ncomplexity is the requirement to support the crew in the hostile\nenvironment of space. The technological differences are\nsignificant. From a behavioral or psychological perspective,\nhowever, the differences between confinement in a small wooden\nship locked in the polar icecap and confinement in a small,\nhigh-technology ship hurtling through interplanetary space are\nprobably few.\nFigure 2. Models of the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria in\nFront of Launch Pad 39A. Like NASA, Columbus believed\nin triple redundancy. With fewer than three hulls the\nexpedition might not have survived, as the Santa Maria\nwent aground on Christmas Day, 1492. (Courtesy of\nNASA)\nBEHAVIORAL THEMES\nI began a chronological review of past expeditions with\naccounts of Columbus's first voyage to the New World in 1492.\nAlthough the outward-bound trip for Columbus's three small\nships took only thirty-three days and the total voyage lasted\nabout seven months, accounts of this expedition have\nconsiderable relevance. Columbus faced many of the same\nproblems, including strong-willed and independent subordinates,\nthat will confront leaders of future expeditions. My review also\nincluded accounts of Charles Darwin's famous 1831-36 voyage\nonboard the Beagle, of commercial whaling and sealing voyages,\nand of more recent adventures (e.g., Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki\nand The Ra Expedition). Although my range was broad,\nlate-nineteenth-\nand twentieth-century accounts of polar\nexpeditions predominate. Notable among these are Fridtjof\nNansen's Norwegian Polar Expedition (1893-97); the Belgian\nAntarctic Expedition (1898-99); the Amundsen and Scott race\nto the South Pole (1910-12); Ernest Shackleton's British\nTrans-Antarctic Expedition (1914-16); Admiral Richard E.\nByrd's two expeditions to Antarctica (1928-30 and 1933-35);\nand the International Biomedical Expedition to the Antarctic, or\nIBEA (1980-81). I also studied other examples of human\nexperience characterized by isolation and confinement, including\nsuch underwater habitats as Sealab and Tektite; offshore oil\nplatforms; saturation chambers; submarines; Skylab; and\nremote-duty military and scientific environments. Recently, I\ncompleted an analysis of diaries maintained by the leaders and\nphysicians at French remote-duty stations, providing the first\nquantitative data on the relative importance of behavioral issues.\nMy research methods have resulted in an alternative to the\ntraditional behavioral science perspective on life in isolation and\nconfinement. This alternative perspective places new emphasis\non the many examples in which humans have operated\nsuccessfully for long durations despite their austere, isolated,\nand confined conditions. The well-known disasters are\ninstructive, because they remind us of the need to be careful in\nGravitational and Space Biology Bulletin 13(2), June 2000\n\nBEHAVIORAL LESSONS FROM POLAR AND SPACE EXPLORATION\nthe design of habitats, equipment, and procedures and in the\nselection of personnel for special duty. The successes, however,\nare\nperhaps\nmore\ninstructive,\nproviding\nconsiderable\nencouragement to those who will be called upon to endure the\ninevitable stressors associated with space station missions and\nlife on future lunar bases and interplanetary spacecraft.\nThe main themes to emerge from my research are as\nfollows:\n- There are highly predictable behavioral\nresponses to isolation and confinement.\n- Minor\ninterpersonal\nand\npsychological\nproblems are common, but serious problems\nare avoidable if proper precautions are taken.\n- Future long-duration space expeditions will\nmore closely resemble sea voyages than the\ntest flights that have served as models up to\nnow.\n- Valuable lessons concerning the design and\nconduct of future expeditions can be learned\nfrom studying the experiences of remote-duty\npersonnel and previous explorers.\n- Humans can endure almost anything.\nTwenty-two categories of behavioral issues have emerged\nfrom my research. All of these issues are involved, to varying\ndegrees, in an individual's adjustment to living and working in\nisolation and confinement. They are listed below in their order of\nsalience, as determined by the content analysis of remote-duty\ndiaries (Stuster, Bachelard and Suedfeld, 1999):\nGroup Interaction\nOutside Communications\nWorkload\nRecreation & Leisure\nMedical Support\nAdjustment\nLeadership\nEvents\nFood Preparation\nOrganization & Management\nEquipment\nSleep\nSafety\nPersonnel Selection\nWaste Management\nInternal Communications\nExercise\nHabitat Aesthetics\nHygiene\nPersonal Hygiene\nPrivacy/Personal Space\nClothing\nRecommendations range from special theme dinners--to\npromote group solidarity and help mark the passage of time--to\nprivate quarters designed to mitigate the cumulative stress that\nresults from the unrelenting proximity of one's comrades.\nRemaining comments address the most salient category, \"Group\nInteraction.\"\nMark Twain said that the best way to learn if you like\nsomeone is to travel with that person. However, the crews of\nfuture space expeditions will experience interpersonal problems\neven if friendship and compatibility have been established\nthrough years of selection, simulation, and training together.\nWhile individuals cause some difficulties, most interpersonal\nproblems within isolated and confined groups are rather the\ninevitable result of fundamental forces and processes that are\ncharacteristic of the experience. Sustained, close personal contact\ncan be extremely stressful, and interpersonal problems are\nexacerbated by additional sources of stress, such as danger, time\npressure, equipment malfunctions, and heavy workloads (or,\nconversely, boredom). This stress is cumulative, and behavioral\nconsequences are likely if there is no way to eliminate its\nsource--for example, by removing oneself from the group\ntemporarily. But, as the physician of the Belgian Antarctic\nExpedition described in the following diary entry, it is\nimpossible to get away from one's comrades when living in\nisolation and confinement:\n20 May 1898: I do not mean to say that we are\nmore discontented than other men in similar\nconditions. This part of the life of polar\nexplorers is usually suppressed in the\nnarratives. An almost monotonous discontent\noccurs in every expedition through the polar\nnight. It is natural that this should be so, for\nwhen men are compelled to see one another's\nfaces, encounter the few good and the many\nbad traits of character for weeks, months, and\nyears, without any outer influence to direct the\nmind, they are apt to remember only the rough\nedges which rub up against their own bumps of\nmisconduct. If we could only get away from\neach other for a few hours at a time, we might\nlearn to see a new side and take a fresh interest\nin our comrades; but this is not possible. The\ntruth is, that we are at this moment as tired of\neach other's company as we are of the cold\nmonotony of the black night and of the\nunpalatable sameness of our food. Now and\nthen we experience affectionate moody spells\nand then we try to inspire each other with a\nsort of superficial effervescence of good cheer,\nbut such moods are short-lived. Physically,\nmentally, and perhaps morally, then, we are\ndepressed, and from my past experience in the\nArctic I know that this depression will increase\nwith the advance of the night, and far into the\nincreasing dawn of next summer. (Cook 1980\n[1900], 290-91)\nImagine living in a medium-sized motor home, locked in\nwith five other adults for a period of three years. Socially, this\nsituation approximates a mission to Mars. The crew will be\nexcited following departure from Earth orbit and extremely busy\nGravitational and Space Biology Bulletin 13(2), June 2000\n\nBEHAVIORAL LESSONS FROM POLAR AND SPACE EXPLORATION\nwith important technical tasks, contingency planning, and\nmission-abort rehearsal activities. But a change will occur as the\nexcitement dissipates and the days begin to blend into weeks,\nthen months--as the crew makes the transition to the cruise\nphase of the voyage. Each crew member's repertoire of jokes,\nanecdotes, personal experiences, and opinions will become well\nknown to the other members of the tiny, closed society (if this\nhas not already occurred during years of premission training and\nsimulations). Nothing that anyone says or does will seem new,\nand previously innocuous mannerisms will be magnified into\nintolerable flaws as crew members become increasingly weary of\neach other. The lavatory and the small compartments that serve\nas private sleep chambers offer the only escapes from others.\nInterpersonal friction and overt conflicts among crew members\nare the inevitable consequences of these conditions.\nThe stresses associated with isolation and confinement\nconsistently result in minor interpersonal problems; sometimes\nmajor conflicts occur, but they are rare. Typically, exaggeration\nof trivial issues causes most of the interpersonal conflicts that\noccur within isolated and confined groups--issues that under\nnormal conditions would be considered inconsequential. The\nmost trivial of issues are predictably exaggerated beyond\nreasonable proportions by the relentless proximity of comrades\nand by the other stresses of isolated and confined living that\naccumulate over time. Dr. Desmond Lugg's final, predeparture\nwords to Australian Antarctic personnel concern what he has\nnamed \"The Rule of 10\": that is, when one is isolated, the\nstrength of one's initial reaction--be it to someone within the\ngroup or to a communication from the outside--should be\ndivided by ten to achieve the appropriate measure before\nresponding.\nAn account of the International Biomedical Expedition to\nthe Antarctic (IBEA), written in 1988 by Jean Rivolier and his\ncolleagues, provides the most relevant examples of interpersonal\nproblems. The IBEA, composed of a total of twelve scientists\nfrom five nations, was conducted, in part, to obtain information\nabout group interaction that might be useful to future space\nmissions. This objective was achieved; the interpersonal\nproblems experienced during the IBEA are extremely relevant to\nplans for future expeditions. Rivolier et al. describe the\nproblems:\nThere were times such as at the onset of the\nlaboratory programme in Sydney and at the\narrival of the group in Antarctica when the\ngroup worked with a will as a team to unpack\nand test their gear. But the harmony was\nshort-lived. Individuals asserted themselves.\nThey competed with each other for status and\nresponsibility, and they drew apart in their\nnational groups. Occasionally they regrouped\naccording to their antipathy to particular\nexperimenters, and even less occasionally\nthey forgot their differences to enjoy each\nother's company. (1988, 91)\nFigure 3. Card Games During Richard E. Byrd's First\nExpedition to Antarctica Helped the Men Pass the Long\nWinter Night. (Courtesy of the National Archives)\nOn the twentieth day of the seventy-one-day motorized\ntraverse that began near the Dumont d'Urville station, one\nmember of the expedition had to be evacuated for psychological\nreasons. The others endured the entire mission but returned from\nthe traverse \"humorless, tired, despondent, and resentful.\" None\nof the participants found their Antarctic experience enjoyable,\nnot due to climate or hardships but to the \"inconsiderate and\nselfish behavior\" of colleagues. Most of the interpersonal\nproblems were precipitated by disagreements over the\nperformance of necessary communal work and camp chores.\nThese trivial issues were aggravated by underlying rivalries and\ncultural and language differences among members of the party.\nDespite the efforts of the organizers, the group was fragmented\nand lacked a unifying spirit or sense of mission. Fortunately, no\nserious emergency occurred that would have required a\ncoordinated response.\nIf trivial issues are inevitably, sometimes dangerously,\nblown out of proportion, it seems clear that a way to minimize\nthe potential for this phenomenon would be to eliminate, to the\nextent possible, differences among the members of an expedition.\nIn this regard, it is important to note that the most successful\n(i.e., remarkable) expeditions have been conducted by relatively\nhomogeneous groups or groups that have been organized\nspecifically on the basis of compatibility. The most salient\nexamples are Fridtjof Nansen's group of thirteen Norwegians\nwho sailed onboard the Fram (Norwegian Polar Expedition,\n1893-96), and the twenty-seven men carefully selected by\nErnest Shackleton to conduct an ambitious expedition to\nAntarctica onboard the Endurance (Imperial Trans-Antarctic\nExpedition, 1914-15). The Fram's crew endured three years of\nisolation and confinement and, in the process, reached what was\nthen the point farthest north achieved by humans, an\naccomplishment of such magnitude at the time that modern\nreaders might find it difficult to comprehend. In contrast, the\nGravitational and Space Biology Bulletin 13(2), June 2000\n\nBEHAVIORAL LESSONS FROM POLAR AND SPACE EXPLORATION\nEndurance never even reached Antarctica; but the performance\nof Shackleton's crew in surviving the loss of their ship may have\nbeen an even greater achievement than that of the Norwegians. It\nis true that both of these exemplary expeditions experienced\nsome interpersonal problems, but not nearly to the extent of\ncontemporary expeditions composed of heterogeneous crews.\nIt is not feasible to select a homogeneous crew for future\nspace expeditions because of the social and economic realities of\nthese endeavors. International cooperation will be necessary to\nfinance such large-scale undertakings as lunar bases and\ninterplanetary voyages. Thus, many future space crews will be\ncomposed of individuals from different countries and cultures. In\nshort, it appears inevitable that cultural differences, such as\nthose that contributed to divisiveness during the Belgian\nAntarctic Expedition and the IBEA, will be a component in\nfuture space expeditions. What can be done to mitigate the\ndisruptive effects of these differences?\nIt would be prudent to develop countermeasures to\nminimize the possibility of conflict in crews composed of\nindividuals of different genders, technical specialties, ages, and\ncultural\nand\nnational\nbackgrounds.\nPersonnel\nselection\nprocedures, training programs, formal policies, and informal\npractices and customs could greatly reduce the potential for\nserious interpersonal problems. The ideal personnel selection\nsystem would identify those candidates who are both willing and\ncapable of working with others under special conditions, and it\nwould actually select crews, at least in part, on the basis of\nspecific intracrew compatibilities.\nAn extensive program of behavioral research at early U.S.\nAntarctic stations was precipitated by a severe psychosis that\nemerged among the Navy crew that was preparing a base for the\nInternational Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957. The research,\nlargely conducted by Eric Gunderson and Paul Nelson, involved\nseveral hundred winter-over personnel and the identification of\nthree clusters of behavioral traits that were highly correlated\nwith effective performance at Antarctic stations. Gunderson\nlabeled the clusters (1) emotional stability, (2) task performance,\nand (3) social compatibility. Emotional stability involves an\nindividual's ability to maintain control of his or her emotions,\ndespite the stresses of isolated and confined living; \"calm\" and\n\"even-tempered\"\nare\nthe\nideal\ncharacteristics.\nTask\nperformance refers to both task motivation and proficiency;\n\"industrious\" and \"hard-working\" describe the ideal traits in this\ncategory. Social compatibility includes a number of personal\ncharacteristics, such as likability, cheerfulness, and consideration\nfor others; \"friendly\" and \"popular\" are the ideal characteristics.\nNavy psychologists and psychiatrists have used these categories\nfor the past three decades to guide the screening of volunteers for\nAntarctic duty.\nGunderson and his colleagues at the Naval Health Research\nCenter estimated the relative importance of the three behavioral\nclusters to overall performance at U.S. Antarctic stations, as\nperceived by Navy and civilian winter-over personnel (Doll and\nGunderson, 1970; Gunderson, 1973b). Crew ratings of their\ncolleagues on the three behavioral traits were correlated with\nresponses to a criterion item: \"If you were given the task of\nselecting men to winter over at a small station, which men from\nthis station would you choose first?\" A fourth variable,\nfriendship, was included in the analysis to serve as a control.\nTable 1 presents the three behavioral clusters and the control\nvariable in rank order of importance, as indicated by the\nmagnitudes of the correlations with the criterion. Civilians judged\nsocial compatibility to be the most important cluster of traits,\nwhereas military personnel favored emotional stability. Social\ncompatibility refers to an individual's ability to get along with\nothers, a difficult process for some in the tension-filled\nenvironment of a remote-duty station. Similarly, emotional\nstability refers to an individual's capacity for avoiding extreme\nmoods and behavior. It is essential to note that both groups\nfound personality traits, rather than task performance, the most\nimportant factors determining the kind of individual with whom\nexperienced personnel would want to share another year in\nisolation and confinement. These results are as statistically and\nintuitively valid today as they were when the studies were\nconducted, and they could be applied to the development of\npersonnel selection criteria for other remote-duty environments,\nsuch as future long-duration space expeditions.\nThe following is a list of personal characteristics required\nfor successful adaptation to isolation and confinement. It is\nbased on the Navy research and on my review of original and\nsecondary sources concerning expeditions and voyages of\ndiscovery.\nLikability\nEmotional control\nPatience\nTolerance\nSelf-confidence (without egotism or arrogance)\nA team approach (willingness to subordinate one's\ninterest to that of the group)\nSense of humor\nSocial resourcefulness (easily entertained)\nTechnical competence\nParticipants in future long-duration expeditions should\nreceive instruction in the behavioral and psycho-logical problems\nthat can occur during an expedition and in techniques to help deal\nwith circumstances as they arise. The astronauts who returned\nTable 1.

As a consequence, a training program has been\ndeveloped and pilot-tested with a group of twelve astronauts\nwho are members of NASA's Expedition Corps, astronauts who\nare candidates for missions to the International Space Station.\nThe two-day training program covers a broad range of issues and\nincludes specific examples of the habitability and behavioral\nprinciples that have been identified in the analogue and\nexperimental literature. The training program also offers fairly\nsimple guidelines, such as the following:\n-\nAvoid controversial subjects.\n-\nConsider the possible consequences before you say\nor do something.\n-\nDo more than your share of communal tasks.\n-\nBe considerate; more than that, try to avoid being\nannoying in any way.\n-\nConsciously attempt to be cheerful and supportive of\nyour teammates.\n-\nBe polite and respectful.\nA particularly divisive source of interpersonal problems\noccurs when the normal tendency for subgroups to form\nescalates into the development of cliques. Although the tendency\nfor subgroups to form is unavoidable, the environment should be\nstructured to encourage maximum communication across\nsubgroups to offset, to some extent, the increased\ncommunication among members within subgroups. Subgroups\nserve as coping mechanisms for some individuals, but they can\nbe disruptive and dangerous, because one person (or more)\ninevitably is excluded.\nMeals offer an opportunity for the type of communication\nthat will help to mitigate the tendency for subgroup formation\namong members of an isolated, confined crew. Eating together as\na group is a natural activity that most people seem to enjoy; the\nbenefits to group solidarity of eating together are so well known\nas to be a behavioral cliche. The requirement for daily nutrition\nand the apparent human tendency to find some pleasure in\ndining together offer valuable opportunities to encourage\ninterpersonal communication that will foster group solidarity\nand counter the potentially negative effects of subgroup\nformation. Some crew members are bound to find reasons to eat\nby themselves and withdraw from the group in other ways. It is\nimportant, however, that the design of equipment and\nprocedures encourages eating together at least once each day, as\nwell as at frequent special dinners (e.g., theme dinners and\ncelebrations of holidays and mission milestones).\nA FINAL NOTE\nThe point is made in the preceding discussion that\ninterpersonal problems are inevitable among individuals living in\nisolation and confinement for long periods, and that the\ninordinate incidence of these problems is a normal consequence\nof living in close proximity to others with no opportunity for\nvariety or escape. Interpersonal problems are certainly common,\nbut serious problems are not inevitable, especially if the\nindividuals are particularly compatible or if their solidarity is\nessential to their survival. For example, Lansing ([1959] 1994)\nwrites of Shackleton and the crew of the Endurance adrift on\ntheir ice floe:\nIt was remarkable that there were not more\ncases of friction among the men, especially\nafter the Antarctic night set in. The gathering\ndarkness and the unpredictable weather limited\ntheir activities to an ever-constricting area\naround the ship. There was very little to\noccupy them, and they were in closer contact\nwith one another than ever. But instead of\ngetting on each other's nerves, the entire party\nseemed to become more close knit. (42)\nIndividual compatibility and recognition of the need to\nmaintain solidarity are among the ingredients of a successful\nlong-duration expedition. Perhaps it was one or both of these\nfactors that permitted Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to\nendure nine months of confinement together in a crude Arctic hut\nwithout a single argument:\nOur spirits were good the whole time; we\nlooked serenely towards the future, and\nrejoiced in the thought of all the delights it had\nin store for us. We did not even have recourse\nto quarrelling to while away the time. (Nansen\n1897, vol. 2, 464)\nAfter their return to Norway, Johansen was asked how\nthey had gotten along during the winter, and whether they had\nquarreled. Reporters were as eager for controversy 100 years ago\nas they are now and they recognized it would be a severe test for\ntwo men to live so long together in perfect isolation. Johansen\nreplied, \"Oh no, we didn't quarrel; the only thing was that I had\nthe bad habit of snoring in my sleep, and then Nansen used to\nkick me in the back.\" He would shake himself a little then sleep\ncalmly. Nansen was shocked when he read Johansen's comment\nin a newspaper. Nansen admitted to giving Johansen many a\nwell-meant kick, but it was a surprise to learn so long afterward\nthat Johansen had awakened sufficiently to realize that he had\nbeen kicked.\nREFERENCES\nAmundsen, R.

History of Bone Studies in Spaceflight and\nEarth-based Analogs\nGiven the right political motivation and an appropriate investment of\nresources, astronauts could be exploring the surface of Mars as early as\n10 years from now. During the 6 to 12 month journey the astronauts\ncould experience bone loss that would put them at serious risk of\nfracture upon return to a gravitational environment, either on Earth or on\nMars. This section explores the history of studies on space flight bone\nloss and assesses what we know to date about the problem.\n1.1 Background\n1.1.1 Measurement of bone mineral density\nThe parameter that is most often used to describe loss of bone mass,\nstiffness, and strength, is bone mineral density (BMD). This is not a\n\"density\" in the traditional engineering sense, that is, total mass divided\nby volume (gm/cm3), but is instead an \"areal density\" of mineral mass\n(gm/cm2). Its value is derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry\n(DXA), in which a two-dimensional projection of a bone is divided up into\nregions in which the bone-mineral content (BMC, calculated from the\namount of X-ray absorptance) is divided by the projected area of the\nregion to yield the BMD value for that region. This technique has several\nlimitations in terms of assessing the strength of bone. Specifically, by\ncollapsing the bone to two dimensions, information about its three\ndimensional geometry, and three dimensional density distribution are\n\nlost. It is thus difficult to reconstruct an engineering model of the bone\nthat takes into account these three-dimensional attributes. To date, all of\nthe measurements of bone mineral loss in the proximal femora of\nastronauts (and subjects in Earth-based space flight simulations) have\nused DXA as the sole imaging technique. To assess strength, the BMD\nvalues obtained from DXA are correlated with in vitro mechanical tests of\ncadaveric femora. Applying more accurate techniques of assessing bone\nstrength, such as the three-dimensional finite element analysis described\nin this thesis, is greatly hindered in the case of space flight studies due to\nthe absense of three dimensional bone information, such as can be\nobtained by computed tomography (CT), for instance. Many of the\nlimitations of the work described in this thesis stem directly from this lack\nof three-dimensional data and it is hoped that future space flight bone\nstudies will fill this information gap.\n1.1.2 Bone Loss in Spaceflight and Earth-based Analogs\nDuring space flights lasting longer than one month, astronauts undergo\nsignificant losses of bone mass and bone mineral density in the weight\nbearing areas of the skeleton, particularly the spine and lower limbs, as a\nresult of the unloading produced by weightlessness in the microgravity\nenvironment (LeBlanc et al., 1998; Holick, 1998; Vico et al., 1998). Due\nto the relatively small number of human subjects who have flown in\nspace, the limited duration of missions to date, and the inaccuracy of\nearly measurement techniques, the problem of bone loss during\nweightlessness is not yet well quantified or well understood. Enough\nevidence has been gained, however, to raise concern about the risk of\nfracture, particularly in the hip, during skeletal loading following return to\nEarth (1 G), during activities on the surface of Mars (3/8 G), or even\nduring strenuous activities performed in weightlessness, such as\nextravehicular (EVA) construction of the International Space Station\n(ISS).\nThe results of studies conducted during the space flights of the 1960's\nand early 1970's are highly variable due to poor measurement\ntechniques employed in some cases. Following the Gemini 4, 5, and 7\nmissions, lasting from 4 to 14 days, investigators noticed a distinct\nincrease in calcium excretion (Lutwak, 1966; Whedon et al., 1967) and\ninitially thought that the astronauts had experienced a dramatic 10-20%\nloss in calcaneus and metacarpal bone density (Mack and Lachance,\n1966; Mack et al., 1967). However, through reevaluation, these losses\n\nwere reduced to about 2-4% for five astronauts and 9% for one astronaut\n(Vose, 1974). The 18-day Soyuz 9 mission produced a 8-10% decrease\nin heel bone density for both cosmonauts (Birykov and Krasnykh, 1970).\nBone density measurement techniques were improved during the three-\nman Apollo flights, lasting up to 13 days, but in only one of these flights\nwere investigators able to measure a significant amount of bone loss\nfrom the heel (Rambaut et al., 1975).\nStudies conducted during the longer-term Skylab, Salyut and Mir space\nstation missions allowed for better measurement of calcium homeostasis\nand bone density, but were confounded by other factors such as variable\ncompliance with prescribed exercise countermeasures intended to\nminimize bone loss. Skylab metabolic data indicate that over a three\nmonth period, the total negative calcium balance from excess urine and\nfecal excretion is as much as 25 grams (Rambaut et al., 1979b;\nRambaut et al., 1979a), but later estimates reduced this value to 12.8\ngrams or 1% of the 1250 grams in the average skeleton (Cann, 1993).\nReduced losses during the Skylab 4 mission have been attributed to\nincreased exercise by the astronauts. Both US and Soviet investigations\nestimated that the average bone loss from the calcaneus was 1% per\nmonth (Stupakov et al., 1984). A combined US / USSR study of long-\nterm spaceflight, in which quantitative computed tomography (QCT)\nscans were taken of the spine found no significant loss of density in the\nvertebral bodies (Oganov et al., 1990), apparently validating the exercise\ncountermeasures. Closer inspection, however, revealed that there was\nan 8% loss of density in the posterior elements of the vertebrae, which\ncorrelated with a 4% loss of volume in the attached muscles, perhaps\ndemonstrating the limited effectiveness of exercise countermeasures in\nspace. Further evidence of this limitation came from QCT scans of one\ncosmonaut after a 366-day Mir mission, which showed a 10% loss of\ntrabecular bone mass in L1, L2, and L3 vertebrae (Grigoriev et al.,\n1991). When investigators started looking at other regions in the body,\nthey found even more distressing losses. Most significantly, a\nquantitative digital radiography (QDR, equivalent to DXA) study of\ncosmonauts after 4.5--6 month long missions on Mir found bone mineral\ndensity (BMD) losses of as much as 14% in the femoral neck and\ngreater trochanter of the hip (Oganov et al., 1992). A study of US\nastronauts found that even in relatively short flights (1 to 2 weeks), the\nvertebrae L2-4 could lose as much as 3% of baseline BMD (Miyamoto et\nal., 1998).\n\nSpaceflight Bone Loss in Humans\nFlight /\nStudy\nFinding\nReferences\nGemini 4,5,\nand 7\n4-14days; Calcaneus and\nmetacarpal bone density\nlosses of 2-4% for 5\nVose, 1974\nSoyuz 9\n18 days; 8-10% decrease in\ncalcaneus density for both\ncosmonauts\nBirykov and\nKrasnykh,\nSkylab 2\nMission\nNo significant bone mineral\ncontent changes in arm;\ncalcaneus loss returned to\nRambaut, et\nal. 1975\nLong Term\nFollow-Up of\nSkylab Bone\nStatistically significant loss of\nos calcis mineral in nine\nSkylab crewmembers, 5\nTilton, et al.\nCombined\nU.S. / U.S.S.R\nStudy of Long\nQCT of spine; Up to 8\nmonths; No loss in vertebral\nbodies, but 8% loss in\nOganov, et al.\nMir 366-Day\nMission\nOne cosmonaut averaged\n10% loss of trabecular bone\nfrom L1, L2, L3; measured by\nGrigoriev, et\nal.\nMir 4.5 - 6\nMonth Flights\nQDR assessment of BMD;\ntotal body mineral losses\naveraged 0.4%; most marked\nOganov, et al.\nMir 1 and 6\nMonth Flights\npQCT; noticeable loss of\ntrabecular and cortical bone\nin the tibia after 6 months\nCollet, et al.\nNASDA Study\nof 2 NASA\nAstronauts\n42 year old femaleand 32\nyear old male; short flight;\nnegative calcium balance;\nMiyamoto, et\nal. 1998\nof 2 NASA\nAstronauts\nof 2 NASA\nAstronauts\nyear old male; short flight;\nnegative calcium balance;\n3.0% loss of BMD in L2-4\nyear old male; short flight;\nnegative calcium balance;\n3.0% loss of BMD in L2-4\nyear old male; short flight;\nnegative calcium balance;\n3.0% loss of BMD in L2-4\nal. 1998\n\nThe seriousness of the losses in BMD during spaceflight is evident when\ncompared with the losses attributed to aging. On average, the rate of\nBMD loss for the proximal femur and lumbar vertebrae in men and\nwomen over 55 years of age has been estimated to be around 0.5--1%\nper year (Burger et al., 1998; Greenspan et al., 1996; Ensrud et al.,\n1995; Jones et al., 1994). These rates of loss are believed to increase\nthe risk of hip fracture in elderly individuals at the rate of about 4% per\nyear and beyond age 75 the risk of hip fracture increases exponentially.\nAs mentioned above, the rates of loss from the same skeletal areas\nduring spaceflight are about 1 - 2% per month, 10 or more times greater\nthan the rate occurring in normal aging. From another perspective, an\nestimated loss of 20% in femoral neck BMD during a year of spaceflight\nwould correspond to the average BMD loss in the femoral neck of a\nwoman aging from 50 years to almost 80 years (Looker et al., 1995).\nWhile the mechanisms responsible for bone loss in ageing and\nspaceflight are probably different (LeBlanc and Schneider, 1991), the\nsimilarities in the observed changes may be of mutual benefit to the\nstudy of either case (Hughes-Fulford, 1991).\nSome investigators have used bed rest as an analog for the skeletal\nunloading experienced in spaceflight. One early study put 90 healthy\nyoung men through 5-36 weeks of bed rest and found that not only was\nthere an average 5% loss of calcaneal mineral each month, but that\nmechanical and biochemical countermeasures were unsuccessful at\npreventing this loss (Schneider and McDonald, 1984). During another 17\nweek bed rest study, subjects lost an average of 0.21 +/- 0.05% per\nweek of bone mineral density in the femoral neck, and 0.27 +/- 0.05%\nper week in the trochanteric area (LeBlanc et al., 1990). Other studies\nhave shown similar mineral losses, slowing of mineralization, and\nlimitations of countermeasures. Some studies have also encountered\ncontradictory results demonstrating the difficulties of bed rest as an\nanalog for spaceflight (Vico et al., 1987; Zaichick and Morukov, 1998).\nThe combined results of space flight and bed rest studies, in terms of\nmeasured BMD loss, are summarized in Table 1.1. The last column is a\nnormalized parameter indicating the actual or projected BMD loss per\nyear.\nnormalized parameter indicating the actual or projected BMD loss per\nyear.\n\nBedrest / Hypokinesia Studies\nModels for Weightlessness of\nSpaceflight\nStudy\nFinding\nReferences\n5-36 Weeks\nBedrest\n90 healthy young men; 5%\nloss of calcaneal mineral\neach month; mechanical and\nbiochemical\ncountermeasures not\nsuccessful\nSchneider\nand\nMcDonald,\n120-Day\nBedrest\nMineralization rate slowed;\ncontradictory results\ndemonstrate difficulties of\nbedrest as space analog\nVico, et al.\n17-Week\nBedrest\n6 healthy young males; 6\nmonths of reambulation;\nBMD % change (p<0.5):\nfemoral neck (FN) -3.6\ntrochanter (t) -4.6; % /week\n(p<0.5): FN -.21 +/- .05, T-\n.27 +/- .05; Reambulation %\nrecovery: FN 0.00 +/- .06, T\n0.05 +/- .05 (prox. femur did\nnot recover well)\nLeBlanc, et al.\n370-Day\nAntiorthostatic\nHypokinesia\nTest\nHighest losses in foot bones;\nremedial measures delay\nosteoporosis but do not\ncompletely exclude it; results\nobtained by different\nmethods often conflicting\nZaichick and\nMorukov,\nResults from animal studies of bone mineral loss in spaceflight and\nimmobilization have been highly variable due to differences in study\n\ndesign, duration, and measurement techniques. In addition, much of the\nvariability may be due to the age of the animals, since many of the early\nstudies were carried out on rats that were still growing (less than 5-6\nmonths old). Rats were flown on eight Russian Cosmos biosatellite\nmissions, lasting from 5 days to 22 days, as well as on the US Spacelab\n3 mission (7 days). Juvenile male rhesus monkeys were flown on five\nCosmos missions and an adult nemestria macaque monkey was flown\non an early US mission (Biosatellite 3). Additional studies were carried\nout on rats and monkeys in various forms of suspension and\nhypokinesia. Bone formation was found to be reduced in the metaphyses\nof long bones during the first Cosmos mission (Yagodovsky et al., 1976).\nThe Cosmos 782 and 936 missions resulted in a 40% reduction in the\nlength of the primary spongiosa (Asling, 1978) and a 30% decrease in\nthe femoral breaking strength (Spector et al., 1983). In addition, these\nmissions revealed that an arrest line separating normal bone from\ndefective and hypomineralized bone formed during spaceflight (Turner et\nal., 1985) and that osteoblast differentiation in non-weight bearing bones\nwas suppressed during weightlessness (Roberts et al., 1981), thus\nyielding evidence that other bones in the body might be affected in long\nterm flight. Rats flown for 5 days aboard the Cosmos 1514 biologic\nsatellite incurred no measurable change in bone mass (Vico et al.,\n1987), while calcium excretion studies on monkeys on the same flight\nshowed evidence of increased resorption (Cann et al., 1986). After the\nslightly longer Cosmos 1667 mission, the flight rats showed a greater\nloss of trabecular bone in the proximal metaphyses of the tibia than rats\nundergoing tail suspension for the same duration on earth (Kaplansky et\nal., 1987; Vico et al., 1991). Rats undergoing tail suspension of their\nhindlimbs for 15 days showed reductions in calcium content to 86.2 ±\n2.5% for the tibia, and 75.5 ± 3.5% for vertebrae (Globus et al., 1984),\nwhile those exposed to hypokinesia and head-down suspension for\nperiods of 35 to 60 days exhibited osteoporosis in the tibial and vertebral\nspongiosa (Durnova et al., 1986). Other tail suspension studies revealed\na reduction of osteoblast number and growth and mineralization rates in\nthe unloaded bones (Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998). Rhesus monkeys\nflown for 13 days on Cosmos 1887 and 2044, and 11.5 days aboard\nCosmos 2229, showed reduced bone mineralization and growth and a\nsignificant decrease in whole body bone mineral content (BMC), with\nonly partial recovery by one month post-flight (Cann et al., 1990; Zerath\net al., 1996). In addition, during the Cosmos 2044 mission it was shown\nthat the fracture repair process was impaired in rats (Kaplansky et al.,\n1991).\n\nSpaceflight Bone Loss in Animals\nFlight /\nStudy\nFinding\nRats; 40% reduction in length\nof primary spongiosa due to\nreduced formation and\nincreased resorption\nRats; Osteoblast\nCosmos 605\nCosmos 782\nRats; Bone formation\nreduced in metaphyses of\nlong bones\nReferences\nYagodovsky,\net al. 1976\nAsling, 1978\nRoberts, 1981\nSpector, et al.\nTumer, et al.\nGlobus, et al.\nCann, et al.\nCann, et al.\nVico, et al.\nCosmos 782?\nCosmos 936\nCosmos 782\n& 936\nRat Tail\nSuspension,\nCosmos 1514\nCosmos\n1667, 1887,\nCosmos 1667\ndifferentiation in non-weight-\nbearing site suppressed\nduring weightlessness\nRats; 30% decrease in\nfemoral breaking strength of\nfemora with recovery of\nRats; Arrest line separating\nbone formed during and\npost-spaceflight; defective\nand hypomineralized bone\nUp to 15 days; Calcium\ncontent: tibia = 86.2 +/- 2.5%,\nvertebra = 75.5 +/- 3.5% of\ncontrol\nPrimates; 5 days; resorption\nincreased during flight\nPrimates; 13 days; lower\nmineralization rate and less\nbone mineralized;\nlongitudinal growth slowed\nRats; 7 day spaceflight vs. 7\nday tail-suspension; loss of\ntrabecular bone in prox tibial\nCosmos 2044\nKaplansky, et\nal. 1991\nRats; fracture repair process\nimpaired during flight\n\nCosmos 2229\nPrimates; 11.5 days,\ntendency toward decreased\nBMC during flight; only partial\nrecovery 1 month after\nZerath, et al.\nRat-Tail\nSuspension\nUnloaded bones display\nreduced osteoblast number,\ngrowth, and mineralization\nrate in trabecular bone\nMorey-Holton\nand Globus,\n1.1.3 Summary of findings from spaceflight and immobilization\nstudies\nThe findings of these spaceflight and immobilization studies, conducted\nover the past 35 years, may be summarized as follows:\n- Significant bone loss occurs in humans and animals exposed to\nweightlessness during spaceflight\n- Urine and fecal calcium excretion is increased resulting in a\nnegative calcium balance\n-\nCalcium resorption from bone is increased and\nabsorption from gut is decreased\n-\nBone mineral density decreases\n- Critical weight-bearing areas lose density most rapidly and\nthe rate of loss is approximately 1-2% per month\n-\nNon-weight-bearing areas are affected in the\nlong term\n- Osteoblast proliferation and activity are reduced while osteoclast\nactivity either remains the same or increases slightly\n-\nBone growth is slowed\n-\nFracture repair is impaired\n-\nBone strength is reduced\n1.2 Significance\nSeveral conclusions may be drawn regarding the significance of these\nskeletal changes in terms of human spaceflight.\n\n- Astronauts and cosmonauts spending a significant period in\nweightlessness (> 1 month) will experience a loss of bone strength\nand a subsequent increase in fracture risk during:\n-\nActivities on Earth (walking / running, falls)\n-\nIntravehicular / extravehicular activity (IVA /\nEVA) on Mars or in weightlessness\n- A fracture occurring on Mars (3/8 G) has serious consequences to\nthe individual and crew due to:\n-\nremoteness (limited medical resources)\n-\npossible inhibition of fracture repair and\nimmune respones associated with weightlessness\n-\nloss of functionality in terms of the crew\nmember's skills and duties (increased workload on\nremaining crew members)\nTo date, hip fracture has risk has generally been estimated based on\ncorrelations between bone mineral density (BMD) and failure load for a\ngiven loading condition (usually associated with an specific activity,\nincluding traumatic activities such as falls). In the vast majority of cases,\nthe failure load in this context is obtained through mechanical testing of\ncadaveric femora. Thus, while BMD correlates reasonably well with bone\nstrength in vitro, actual fracture risk is harder to calculate due to in vivo\nfactors (e.g. body mass). Consequently, there exists a need to better\nassess the in vivo fracture risk for astronauts performing normal and\ntraumatic activities following a significant period of weightlessness (i.e.,\nmore than a month).\n1.3 References\nAsling, C.W., Histological studies on tibial bone of rats in the 1975 Cosmos 782 flight, in Final\nreports of U.S experiments flown on the Soviet satellite Cosmos 782, S.N.

We will, however, limit\nourselves to lumped parameter models, and will not discuss distributed-parameter transmission line\ntype models. Hence, we will be able to discuss both average and pulsatile flows, volumes and\npressures, at selected points in the vascular bed, but we cannot discuss pulse wave propagation,\nreflections, detailed fluid flow behavior, etc.\nThere are three major functional components in the systemic vascular bed: the elastic\narteries, the microcirculation (including arterioles, capillaries, and venules), and the venous system.\nSee Figure 1. The pulmonary vascular bed has similar components, but the properties of the\npulmonary vascular resistance are unique.\nFigure 1\nS Y S T E M I C C I R C U L A T I O N\nArteries\nArterioles,\nCapillaries,\nVenules\nVeins\nWe will assume that the major resistive component in the systemic circulation is located at\nthe level of the microcirculation (primarily the arterioles), and that the large arteries and veins\ncontribute primarily capacitance. We will include, however, a small resistance in the venous return\npath. The venous capacitance is much larger than that of the arteries and provides the major\nreservoir for blood volume.\nB.\nVascular Resistance\nLaminar viscous flow in rigid tubes (Poiseuille flow) results in a parabolic distribution of\nvelocities across the tube, and a linear relationship exists between the pressure drop, P, and the flow\nrate, Q, through the tube.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\n∆P = RQ\n(1)\nThe constant of proportionality is the resistance to flow, R. It is dependent upon the\ngeometry of the tube and the viscosity, μ, of the fluid.\nl\nR = π μ 4\n(2)\nr\nwhere l is the length of the tube over which ∆P is measured, and r is the radius of the tube. If the\nflow is measured in cc/sec, and ∆P in dynes/cm2, then the units of resistance are dyne-sec/cm5. If\npressure is measured in mmHg and flow in cc/sec., resistance is expressed in \"peripheral resistance\nunits,\" or PRU. Note that if the mean pressure drop across the circulation were 80 mmHg and the\ncardiac output were 5 liters/min. (which is about 80 cc/sec.) then total peripheral resistance would\nbe close to 1 PRU.\nThe resistance of the tube is directly proportional to length and viscosity and inversely\nproportional to the fourth power of the radius. Thus, one would expect that the major contribution\nto vascular resistance would be made by the smallest vessels.\nOne may use the measured flow distribution in the various vascular beds and the Poiseuille\nformula to estimate the relative resistance offered by various vessels. Such estimates are contained\nin Table 1, confirming that arterioles are the site of most of the peripheral resistance.\nTable 1\nRelative Resistance to Flow in the Vascular Bed\nAorta\n4%\nVenules\n4%\nLarge arteries\n5%\n0.3%\nMean arterial branches\n10%\nMain venous branches\n0.7%\n6%\nLarge veins\n0.5%\nArterioles\n41%\n1.3%\n27%\nTotal venous = 7%\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nTerminal Veins\nTerminal branches\nVena cava\nCapillaries\n\nTotal: arterial + capillary = 93%\n(From Burton 1972, p. 91)\n\nNote also that the strong dependance of the resistance upon vessel radius implies that\nsensitive regulation of flow is possible by changes in vessel diameter due to smooth muscle action.\nAlthough Poiseuille's law has many engineering applications, and although it gives\nconsiderable insight into flow in the circulation; nevertheless, it cannot be rigorously applied to the\ncirculation. It requires the following assumptions:\ni)\nThe fluid is homogeneous and Newtonian.\nBlood may be considered as a Newtonian fluid only if the radius of the vessel\nexceeds 0.5 mm, and if the shear rate exceeds 100 sec.-1. This condition, therefore\nexcludes arterioles, venules, and capillaries, since they are generally considerably\nless than 1 mm in diameter.\nii)\nThe flow is steady and inertia-free.\nIf the flow is pulsatile, the variable pressure gradient communicates kinetic energy to\nthe fluid, and the flow is no longer inertia-free. This condition excludes the larger\narteries.\niii)\nThe tube is rigid so that its diameter does not change with pressure.\nThis condition is never met in the circulatory system. The veins in particular depart\nfrom this assumption.\nAlthough Poiseuille's law does not apply strictly, we will consider that pressure and flow\nare linearly related in those parts of the circulation in which the viscous forces predominate over\ninertial forces (low Reynolds numbers). Hence, we will represent the small vessels (arterioles,\ncapillaries, and venules) as linear resistance elements governed by Eq. 1. (The calculation of R\nmay require modification in some vascular beds, however.)\nC.\nVascular Capacitance\n1.\nIntroduction\nThe walls of blood vessels are not rigid, but rather they stretch in response to increased\ntransmural pressure. The vessel walls contain four major elements: endothelial lining, elastin\nfibers, collagen fibers, and smooth muscle. The endothelium provides a smooth wall, and offers\nselective permeability to certain substances. The endothelial cells play very little part in the total\nelasticity of the walls. However, endothelial cells are active sensors of fluid shear stresses, and play\nan important role in regulation of smooth muscle tone via release of vasoactive molecules. The\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nelastin fibers are easily stretched (about six times more easily than rubber). They produce an elastic\ntension automatically as the vessel expands, and without biochemical energy expenditure. The\ncollagen fibers are much stiffer than the elastin fibers. However, these fibers are slack, and do not\nexert their tension until the vessel has been stretched. Thus, the more the vessel expands, the stiffer\nit becomes. The smooth muscle serves to produce an active tension, contracting under\nphysiological control, and changing the diameter of the lumen of the vessel. Figure 2 shows the\nrelative mixtures of the four elements in walls of various vessels. Notice the predominance of\nelastin in the large and medium arteries, and the predominance of smooth muscle in the small\narterioles. The former are elastic \"storage\" vessels, while the latter are controllable \"resistance\"\nvessels. The thin-walled collapsible veins perform the major storage, or capacitance role in the\ncirculation. The capillaries are formed of only a one cell thick endothelium, and are well suited for\ntheir role as an exchange mechanism between the circulating blood and the interstitial fluid.\nFigure 2\nAorta\nMedium\nSmall artery\nSphincter\nartery\narteriole\npre - cap.

Volume-pressure curves for arteries and veins are\nshown in Figure 3. (Note the different scales.) The slope of the curve at any particular point is a\nmeasure of the incremental capacitance of the vessel. Notice that the V-P curves are not linear and\nthat the vessels get stiffer as they expand--hence the incremental capacitance decreases. Note also\nthat veins have a much larger capacitance than arteries, and are the major storage elements in the\ncirculation.\n∆V\nC =\n(3)\n∆P\nFigure 3\nRelative volume\nAorta\nVena cava\nPressure in cms of water\nFigure by MIT OCW.

The way in which the cross-section of the vessels\nchanges in the two cases is also indicated. (From Burton 1972, p. 55.)\nThe model shown in Figure 4 provides an explanation for the non-linear behavior. In the\nfigure, the thin coils represent \"weak\" elastin fibers at different lengths. The heavy coil represents\na \"stiff\" collagen fibers which are initially not under tension. As the material is stretched, more\nparallel springs are added, which increase overall stiffness as distension is increased. It is also true\nthat the capacitance of arteries decreases with age. This increase in stiffness may be due to an\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nincreased resting length of the elastic and collagen fibers, so a greater number of fibers would be\nstretched in parallel; or to changes in the amount of collagen in the vessel walls.\nFigure 4\nA\nB\nC\nΔL\nL\nF\n--\nA\nE =\nSTRAIN ΔL/L\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nSTRESS F/A\nA\nB\nC\nΔL\nModel explaining the increase in elastic modulus (E) which develops at high strains (∆L/L).

(See figure 5.) The\nmaterial is in equilibrium with a force F0 applied to it. The equilibrium tensile stress then is\nA. If the stress is increased to σ + dσ′, the length will increase to l0 + dl. Hooke's Law\nσ = F0\nrelates the fractional change in length dl/l0 (the strain) to the change in stress, dσ.\ndl\ndσ = E\n(4)\nl0\nFigure 5\nThe constant, E, is known as Young's modulus. The larger E, the \"stiffer\" the material.\nFor blood vessels, E is not constant, but is a function of pressure. The following table shows the\nvariation of E with transmural pressure for the thoracic aorta.\nTable 2\nVariation of Young's Modulus with Intraaortic Pressure\nP, mmHg\nE, dynes/cm2 x 106\n\n1.2\n4.2\nNote: 1 mmHg = 1330 dynes/cm2\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nb.\nLaPlace's Law\nIt is often of importance to relate the tension in the walls of hollow vessels to the transmural\npressure across the walls. Consider a cylinder of length, l, and wall thickness h (Figure 6a). The\ninner radius is r1 and the outer radius is r2. The internal pressure is p1, and the external pressure is\np2. The wall stress (force per unit area) is σ. We wish to derive the relation between σ and the\ntransmural pressure. Imagine that the cylinder is split down the axis (Figure 6b). The total force\npulling the cylinder half down will be:\n= 2σhl\nF1\nFigure 6\nOpposing this force will be that due to the pressures acting on the projected\narea of the cylindrical walls. The net force due to the pressure differences is:\nF2 = 2P1r1l - 2P2r2l\nIn order to have equilibrium,\nF1 = F2\n2σhl = 2l P1r1 - P2r2 )\n(\nσh = (P1r1 - P2r2 )\n(5)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nIf the vessel is thin-walled (h << r), then r1 ≈r2 = r0 and\nσh = r0P\n(6)\nwhere P is the transmural pressure. Equation (6) is an expression of LaPlace's law for a thin-\nwalled cylinder. Note that for a given transmural pressure, the wall tension (T = σh) per unit length\nincreases as the radius increases and vice versa.\nr0P\nCan you derive Laplace's law for a thin-walled sphere?\nσh = 2\nc.\nCalculation of Arterial Capacitance\nThe arterial capacitance per unit length, Cu, may be calculated assuming that vessel length\ndoes not vary with transmural pressure.\ndA p, x )\n(7)\n(\n=\nCu\ndP x )\n(\nwhere A(p,x) and P(x) are the vessel cross-sectional area and transmural pressure respectively Both\nmay be functions of x, the length along the vessel axis, and the area will also vary with pressure, P.\nFrom LaPlace's Law (Eq. 6) we may relate the change in wall stress to the change in\ntransmural pressure at a particular radius, r0.\ndσ = r0 dP + P dr\n(8)\nh\nh\nFrom Hooke's law we have\ndc\ndσ = E\n(9)\nc0\nwhere c is the circumference of the cylinder, 2πr.\n2πdr\ndr\ndσ = E\n= E\n(10)\n2πr0\nr0\nCombining (8) and (10) we obtain the relation between changes in radius and changes in pressure\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nr0\ndr =\nh\n(11)\ndP E\nP\n\n-\n\nr0\nh\nFrom (7):\nd(πr )\ndA\ndr\nCu =\n=\n= 2πr0\n(12)\ndP\ndP\ndP\n=\n2πr0\n(13)\nCu\nEh\n\n- P\n\nr0\nEh\nIn most situations the denominator may be simplified by neglecting P, since\nis the\nr0\nh\ndominant term.

A table of such\ncorresponding variables is presented in Table 3 below.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nTable 3\nFluid Variable\nPressure, P\nVoltage, e\nFlow, Q\nCurrent, i\nCharge, q\n∆P/Q\n∆e/i\nCapacitance, C = ∆V/∆P\nCapacitance, C = ∆q/∆e\nElectrical Variable\nVolume, V\nResistance, R =\nResistance, R =\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nD.\nA Lumped Parameter Model of the Peripheral Circulation\nFigure 7 represents the same circulatory segment as Figure 1 using electrical symbolism:\nFigure 7\nQ\nPa\nPf\nPv\nRv\nCv\nRa\nCa\nIn the figure, Ca represents the equivalent capacitance of the arteries, and Cv the total\ncapacitance of all the veins in the circulation under consideration. Ra is the \"peripheral\" resistance,\nand Rv the resistance to venous flow. Q is the mean flow rate, Pa the arterial transmural pressure,\nPv the venous transmural pressure, and Pf the right atrial or \"filling\" pressure.\nTypical values for each of the components for an adult human are as follows:\nTable 4\nRepresentative Values for Lumped Parameter Model\nCa\n/mmHg\nCv\nRa\nRv\n= 2 ml\n= 100 ml/mmHg\n= 1 mmHg/ml/sec.\n= .06 mmHg/ml/sec.\nWe now proceed to an analysis of the model of Figure 7. Specifically, we would like to establish\nthe relationship between the mean flow rate through the vasculature, Q, and the right atrial filling\npressure, Pf. The reasons for the choice of these parameters will become clearer after discussing\nventricular function, but it is obvious that we could equally well choose other variables to relate if\ndesired.\nWe will designate by Vt the total volume of blood in the peripheral circulation. This\nrepresents approximately 85% of the total blood volume. The remaining fifteen percent resides in\nthe heart and pulmonary circulation. Of the total blood volume in the peripheral circulation, an\namount V0 is required just to fill the undistended system before any transmural pressure is\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\ndeveloped. V0 is known as the \"zero-pressure filling volume\", or the \"non-stressed volume\".\nThe pressure-volume relationships of the arterial and venous systems are plotted below in Figure 8.\nThe figure also shows the effects of varying amounts of sympathetic nervous tone. (Increase in\nsympathetic tone causes vascular smooth muscle to contract, thus shrinking the size of blood\nvessels.)\nFigure 8\nNormal\nNormal\nSympathetic stimulation\nSympathetic stimulation\nArterial system\nSympathetic inhibition\nVenous system\nInhibition\nPressure (mm Hg)\nv olume\nv olume\nVolume (ml)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Saunders, 1982.\nThe volumes stored in the arterial and venous capacitances are given by\nVa = Ca Pa + Va 0\n(14)\nVv = CvPv + Vv0\n(15)\nThe total blood volume in the peripheral circulation is fixed at Vt,\nVt = Va + Vv = Ca Pa + CvPv + V0\n(16)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nV0 is on the order of 3,000 ml in the adult (500 cc. in Va0, and 2500 cc. in Vv0).Vt is\napproximately 4,000 ml. During each cardiac cycle, a stroke volume ∆V enters the arterial system\nand an equal quantity leaves the peripheral vasculature through the venous system to enter the right\nheart. ∆V is small compared to Vt - V0. (∆V ≈ 80 cc.)\nIn steady state if the mean flow is Q, then there will be a pressure drop across each\nresistance such that\nPa - Pv = QRa\n(17)\nPv - Pf = QRv\n(18)\nSuppose the flow were to go to zero. Now all the pressure gradients would disappear, the volume\nwould adjust itself in arteries and veins accordingly, and there would be a mean systemic filling\npressure, Pms, observed at all points.\nPa = Pv = Pf = Pms\nSince now both capacitances are at the same pressure, we have:\n= Ca\nVa\nPms + Va 0\n= Cv\nVv\nPms + Vv0\nand\nVt = Pms (Ca + Cv ) + (Va0 + Vv0 )\n(19)\nNote that\nVt -(Va0 + Vv0 )\nVt - V0\n(20)\n=\n=\nPms\nCa + Cv\nCt\nwhere Ct is the total capacitance of both arteries and veins. Thus Pms is an intrinsic property of\nthe vascular network provided the blood volume and vascular capacitance (vascular tone) are kept\nconstant. Pms is the ratio of total distending volume (Vt - V0) to total systemic capacitance.\nWe will now derive an expression relating the flow, Q, to the filling pressure, Pf and the\nmean systemic filling pressure Pms.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFrom Eqs. (17) and (18) or from inspection of the circuit we have:\nQ = Pa - Pf\n(21)\n+ Rv\nRa\nPa may be related to Pms by combining eqs. (16) and (20)\nCaPa + CvPv = Pms ( Ca + Cv )\nUsing eq. (17), we have:\nCaPa + Cv ( Pa - QRa ) = Pms ( Ca + Cv )\nPa ( Ca + Cv ) - QRaCv = Pms ( Ca + Cv )\nPa = Pms + QRa\nCv\n(22)\nCa + Cv\nSubstituting (22) into (21) and rearranging, we obtain:\nQ =\nPms - Pf\n(23)\nRv + Ra\n\nCa\n\nCa + Cv\nEquation (23) relates flow to filling pressure and includes Pms (a basic property of the system) and\nthe Rs and Cs. From the table of representative values given in Table 4 above it can be seen that the\nsecond term in the denominator is the same order of magnitude as the first term.\nIt should be noted that if Pf is lowered below atmospheric pressure, the veins entering the\nthorax will collapse. Hence, venous return to the heart cannot be increased by negative filling\npressures. (This is the same phenomenon as trying to suck fluid up through a collapsible straw.\nThe collapse of veins is readily observed in the neck veins, and the veins on the dorsum of the\nhands.) The venous return at 0 mmHg tends to be maintained for Pf ≤ 0.\nAs early as 19l4, Starling (Patterson and Starling 1914) made use of the collapse\nphenomenon in his isolated heart-lung preparation (\"Starling resistors\"). The first theoretical and\nexperimental studies of flow through collapsible tubing were done by Holt (1941, 1969). He used\nthe apparatus shown below (Figure 9a), and measured the flow, Q, through a section of collapsible\ntube as a function of the pressure just proximal to the segment (P1), the pressure just distal to the\nsegment (P2), and the pressure external to the segment, Pe. A typical experimental result is shown\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nin Figure 9b, which relates flow to P2 when Pe and P1 are held constant. For downstream pressures\nexceeding the external pressure (P2 > Pe) the vessel is open throughout its length, and the slope of\nthe line is determined by the flow resistance of the open cylindrical tube. For downstream\npressures less than the external pressure, the flow is independent of P2, and is determined by P1 -\nPe. (For more discussion of flow through collapsible tubes, see Caro et al. 1978, 460ff, or Fung\n1984, 186ff).\nFigure 9\nP2\nP1\nPe\nQ\nReservoir\nCollapsible tube\nQ cm3 /m\nPe\n2O\n= 0 cm H\n-50\n-25\nP\ncm H O\nFigure by MIT OCW.

The following figures illustrate the effects on the flow rate of\nmanipulating various parameters: (All experimental curves are for dogs, and idealized curves are for\nhumans.)\n1.\nChanging Resistance\nThe slope of the venous return curve may be changed by varying the quantity\n\nCa\nRv + Ra Ca + Cv\n\n. Thus, interventions that change peripheral resistance, Ra, or the venous return\nresistance Rv (such as compressing the large veins) will cause only a slope change (Figs. 11 and\n12 show idealized human curves, and actual experimental data from dogs.)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 11\n(Idealized curves for humans)\n12.5\nVenous Return (liters/min.)\n7.5\n2.5\nNormal resistance\n2 x normal\n1/2 normal\n-4\nRight Atrial Pressure (mm.Hg)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

(Guyton 1973, p. 215)\nE.\nThe Windkessel Simplification\nIf we restrict our attention to the flow and pressure in the aorta, we may simplify the model\nof the peripheral circulation by assuming that the venous pressure is constant and approximately\nzero (Pv= 0). Our model then reduces to that shown in Figure 16. This simple model is known as\nthe Windkessel model.\nFigure 16\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nIt was originally proposed by the German physicist, O. Frank (Frank 1888). It is a\nsimplified model which represents the circulation as a compliant system of major vessels in which\nnegligible frictional losses are present, and a terminal vascular resistance (the microcirculation). It\nis instructive here to discuss the expected behavior of the simple Windkessel model for the\nperipheral circulation if it is driven with a \"heart\" modelled as a periodic flow impulse generator\nthat ejects stroke volumes of ∆V. (See Figure 17.)\nFigure 17\nUsing this model, it is possible to express the arterial pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean)\nin terms of the model parameters, and to observe the dependence of these pressures on stroke\nvolume, heart rate, arterial capacitance, and peripheral resistance.\nIf the systems starts at t = 0 with no volume in the capacitance vessels, the pressure\nwaveform will build up over time as shown in Figure 18.\nFigure 18\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nThe initial stroke volume will be instantaneously deposited in the arterial capacitance, and\narterial pressure will rise by ∆\na .\nV C\nThe pressure will then decay exponentially, with a time\nconstant τ = RaCa as the volume leaves the capacitor through the peripheral resistance, Ra. Before\nthe pressure reaches zero the next impulse of volume is \"dumped\" into the capacitor, again raising\nthe pressure by an amount ∆\na .\nV C\nEventually the system will reach equilibrium when the volume\ndeposited in the capacitance per beat is exactly matched by the volume leaving the capacitor through\nthe peripheral resistance. We may make use of this requirement of equilibrium to solve the system\nfor the maximum, minimum, and mean arterial pressures in terms of the stroke volume, ∆V, the\ntime between impulses, T, and the properties of the circulation, Ra and Ca.\nIn steady state, the increment in pressure corresponding to the sudden dumping of ∆V\nIn the time, T, during which Ca discharges exponentially through Ra, the\npressure must drop an equal amount.\nIf the steady-state peak pressure is Ps (systolic pressure), the minimal (diastolic) pressure T\nseconds later would be\nonto Ca will be ∆\na .\nV C\n-\na\nT R Ca\nPd = Pse\nHence, the pressure decrease would be\n1 -e -T RaCa )\nPs (\nSetting this quantity equal to ∆\na , we have:\nV C\n∆V\nPs (1 -e -T RaCa ) =\n(24)\nCa\nThus, systolic pressure is given by:\n∆V\nPs = Ca\n⋅\n(1 -e -T RaCa )\n(25)\nDuring the intervals, nT < t < (n + 1)T, the expression for arterial pressure then becomes\n∆V\ne -(t -nt) RaCa\nPa (t) = Ca\n⋅\n(1 -e -T RaCa )\n(26)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nDiastolic Pressure\n∆V\ne -T RaCa\nPd =\n⋅\nCa (1 - e -T RaCa )\n(27)\nPulse Pressure\n∆V\nPs - Pd =\n(28)\nCa\nThe mean pressure Pa is simply the product of the average flow, ∆\n, and the resistance, Ra.\nV T\nThus:\n∆V\nPa =\n⋅ Ra\nT\n(29)\n∆V\n=\n⋅ f ⋅ Ra (f ≡ beats per minute)\nSeveral points are worth observing from the above expressions--first, the mean arterial\npressure is directly proportional to heart rate, stroke volume, and peripheral resistance, as would be\nexpected. Since stroke volume times heart rate equals cardiac output, Equation (29) simply states\nthat the mean arterial pressure equals the product of cardiac output and peripheral resistance.\nExamination of Equation (28) reveals that the pulse pressure is directly proportional to the\nstroke volume and inversely proportional to arterial capacitance. What does this imply for patients\nwith severe arteriosclerotic vascular disease with pipe-like arteries? Does it suggest a simple\napproximate technique to monitor stroke volume?\nThe exponential decay during diastole is a realistic representation of the pressure in the\nhuman aorta. Using our typical values of Ra ≈ 1 mmHg/ml/sec. and Ca ≈ 2 ml/mmHg, the time\nconstant for the decay is about 2 sec. Figure 19 shows the intrarterial blood pressure and flow\nmeasured in the rabbit aorta. At t = 2.5 sec. the heart is stopped with vagal stimulation, and the\nblood pressure falls exponentially, consistent with the Windkessel model.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 19\n-20\nOriginal Pressure\nOriginal Flow\n1.5\n2.5\n3.5\nTime (second)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nII.\nTHE HEART AS A PUMP\nA.\nIntroduction\nThe performance of the heart as a pump is dependent primarily upon the contraction and\nrelaxation properties of the heart muscle cells (myocardium). Other factors must also be\nconsidered such as: the geometric organization of these cells, the presence of connective tissue, the\nheart's electrical rhythm, and valve function. In this section we will examine the mechanical\nfunction of the intact heart and its cellular basis. We will then present a simple model for the heart-\npump and explore the interaction between the heart and peripheral circulation.\nThe heart is a hollow chamber whose walls consist of a mechanical syncytium of\nmyocardial cells. Figure 20 shows the structure of the myocardium at various levels of detail.\nNotice that cardiac muscle is very similar in structure to skeletal muscle, particularly with regard to\nthe sarcomere organization.\n1.\nThe Length-Tension Relationship\nThe biochemical events leading to contraction are similar in skeletal and cardiac muscle.\nThe theory most generally accepted is the sliding filament hypothesis, in which contractile force is\ndeveloped as cross-bridges form between thick and thin filaments in the sarcomeres. Calcium is the\ntrigger for this process as it is released into the cell cytoplasm following an action potential.\nRelaxation of the muscle occurs as calcium is actively removed from the region of the contractile\napparatus by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. (Students who are not familiar with muscle physiology\nshould read chapters 17-18 of Berne and Levy. The biochemical details of electrical excitation-\ncontraction coupling are reviewed in detail in Katz 1992 and Opie 1998, chapter 8.)\nThe total force generated by a contracting muscle is a function of the degree of overlap\nbetween thick and thin filaments, and hence contractile force will be a function of muscle length.\nThe classical findings relating skeletal muscle length and developed tension are shown in Figure\n21.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 20 - Myocardial Structure\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Braunwald, Ross, and Sonnenblick. Mechanisms of Contraction in the Normal and Failing Heart.\n2nd ed. Little-Brown, 1976.\nMyocardial structure, as seen under the light and electron microscopes, is schematized. Top drawing shows section\nof myocardium as it would appear under light microscope, with interconnecting fibers or cells attached end-to-end and\ndelimited by modified cell membranes called intercalated disks. Ultrastructural schematization (center drawing)\nillustrates the division of the fiber longitudinally in to rodlike fibrils, in turn composed of sarcomeres, the basic\ncontractile units. Within the sarcomeres, thick filaments of myosin, confined to the central dark A band, alternate\nwith thin filaments of actin which extend from the A lines (delimiting the sarcomere) through the I band and into the\nA band where they overlap the myosin filaments. These landmarks are seen in detail drawings (bottom). On\nactivation a repetitive interaction between the sites shown displaces the filaments inward so that the sarcomere and\nhence the whole muscle shortens, with maximum overlap at 2.2μ. Also depicted are the membranous systems: the\nT system that carries electrical activity into the cells and the sarcoplasmic reticulum that releases calcium to activate\nthe contractile machinery. Like the intercalated disks, these are specialized extensions of the superficial sarcolemma.\nNote also the rich mitochondrial content, typical of \"red\" muscle, which is highly dependent on aerobic metabolism.\n(From Braunwald, Ross, and Sonnenblick 1976).\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 21\nLength-Tension Relationship in Skeletal Muscle\nA\nB\na\nb\nc\nr\nTension, % of maximum\nC\nB\nD\nA\n1-27\n1-67\n2-0 2-25\n3-65\nO-B4\nE\n1-0\n1-5\n2-0\n2-5\n3-0\n3-5\n4-0\nSarcomere length, μ\nC\n3-65 μ (a+b)\n2-20 - 2-25 μ (b+c)\n2-05 μ (b)\n1-85 - 1-90 μ (b-c)\n1-65 μ (\n)\na+z\n1-05μ 2 (b+z)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

The optimal overlap of myofilaments occurs at a sarcomere range of 2.05 to 2.25μ\n(between 2 and 3). At a sarcomere length shorter than 2.0μ (4) thin filaments pass into the opposite half of the\nsarcomere and a double overlap occurs (5 and 6). Note that the central 0.2μ of the thick filament is devoid of cross-\nbridges which could interact with sites on the think filaments.

After Opie, 1998.\nThe relationship between sarcomere lengths and tension for cardiac muscle in comparison with skeletal muscle.\nNote (i) the effect of increasing calcium ion concentration and (ii) the absence of any decrease of tension at maximal\nsarcomere lengths so that there is no basis for the descending limb of the Starling curve. Recent sophisticated laser-\ndiffraction techniques invalidate previous curves based on apparent sarcomere length-tension relationships of\nimperfect papillary muscle preparations. For data on failing human heart, see Holubarsch et al. (1996). (From\nOpie 1998.)\nNote that at sarcomere lengths greater than 3.65 microns developed tension is zero--presumably\nbecause there is no overlap between thick and thin filaments. The overlap increases as length\ndecreases to 2.2 microns, and tension increases proportionately. As the sarcomere length decreases\nbelow 2.0 microns, developed tension decreases. The reasons are not clear, but may be related to\nchanges in geometry, or level of \"activation\" of the contractile process.\nCardiac muscle exhibits a length-tension relationship which is not exactly the same as that\nfor skeletal muscle. Figure 22 compares the length-tension curves for skeletal muscle and cardiac\nmuscle. Both active and resting tensions are shown for isometric (constant length) contractions.\nResting tension is much greater in cardiac muscle than in skeletal muscle. In normal hearts,\nmyocardial cells cannot be stretched much beyond the peak of the length-tension curve, and\nnormally operate on the ascending limb of the curve.\nFigure 23a,b shows length tension data obtained from cat papillary muscle. The scheme of\nthe experimental apparatus is shown in Figure 23a. In its fully relaxed state the muscle exhibits the\nlength-tension relationship shown in the \"passive\" curve of Figure 23b. It behaves as a non-linear\nspring. As the muscle reaches longer lengths it becomes increasingly stiff. The passive length-\ntension relationship is determined by the mechanical properties of the muscle cells and the\nassociated connective tissue which is part of the muscle.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nIf the muscle contracts from a particular resting length and tension, it will develop active\ntension. Maximum tension will occur if the length of the muscle is fixed (isometric contraction).\nThe active tension is a function of the initial resting tension (the preload). Higher developed tension\nis generated from longer resting lengths, and vice versa. The active tension curve in Figure 23b is a\nplot of active tension versus resting muscle length.\nWhat happens if the muscle is allowed to shorten during the contraction phase? When the\ntension developed by the muscle reaches the afterload determined by the weight, the muscle will\nshorten until the final length-tension coordinates again fall on the active curve.\nA first-order model for the papillary muscle might be a two-state spring as shown in Figure\n23c. The spring constant K is low during the resting state, but is high during the active state of the\nmuscle. The resultant length-tension curves would, of course, be linear, but they do capture the\nessence of the muscle's behavior as shown in Figure 23b.\n2.\nPressure-Volume Relationships in the Ventricle\nThe intact heart exhibits mechanical behavior which resembles the length-tension behavior\nof isolated muscle. We will focus on a single ventricle. Instead of plotting tensions and lengths, it\nis much more convenient to measure and plot pressures and volumes. (One can relate\nintraventricular pressure to wall tension by appropriate application of LaPlace's law. Similarly,\nventricular volume can be related to circumference.) A plot of ventricular pressure vs. volume is\ncalled a \"ventricular function curve\" and may be drawn for both the resting phase of the cardiac\ncycle (diastole) and the actively contracting phase (systole) (Figure 24). Such data may be\nobtained by filling the ventricle to different levels and measuring both diastolic pressure and volume\nto create the diastolic curve. Points on the systolic curve may be obtained by causing the ventricle\nto contract isovolumetrically (with the aorta clamped, for example) and measuring systolic pressure.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 23\nIsolated Cardiac Muscle Experiments\nRelation Between Force (Tension) and\nLength for the Cat Papillary Muscle\nT\nl\nForce (gms)\nE\nC\nA\nF\nG\nI\nJ\nH\nB\nD\nInitial length\n0.1\n11.25\n12.00\n12.40\n12.65\n12.80\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nPassive\nPreload (gms)\n(mm)\nActive\na.

It has been shown in Figure 24 as a plot of maximum isovolumetric\nventricular pressure vs. end-diastolic volume.\nThe \"Law of the Heart\" may be expressed in a variety of forms. Several \"output\"\nvariables may be plotted on the ordinate including: ventricular pressure, stroke volume, cardiac\noutput, stroke work, etc. A variety of \"input\" variables may be plotted on the abscissa including:\nend-diastolic volume, end-diastolic pressure, sarcomere length, circumference, etc. All of these\nvariations may be seen in the literature, and they all express in some sense the input/output behavior\nof the ventricle as stated by Starling: \"the energy of contraction is a function of the length of the\nmuscle fiber\". This behavior of the heart is intrinsic to the myocardium itself, and is independent\nof any extrinsic neural or hormonal influences. One of the implications of Starling's Law is that\nthe \"output of the heart is equal to and determined by the amount of blood flowing into the heart,\nand may be increased or diminished within very wide limits according to the inflow\"...(Starling,\n1918).\nVd is the volume of blood in the ventricle when the transmural pressure is zero. It is\nreferred to as the \"dead volume\" or \"zero-pressure filling volume\". Vd is generally not the same\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nduring diastole and systole, as is indicated in Figure 24. Estimates of the dead volumes during\nsystole and diastole are given below in Table 5 (page 44).\nIf as shown in Figure 25 an isolated left ventricle is filled with a constant preload pressure,\nPf, and if the aorta is connected to a constant afterload pressure, Pa, a pressure-volume loop will be\ngenerated during the heart's pumping cycle, as shown in Figure 26. The cycle begins at (1) when\nthe heart is at end-diastolic pressure and volume, Pf. From 1 to 2 the ventricle contracts with no\nchange in volume (isovolumetric contraction phase) since both mitral and aortic valves are closed.\nFrom 2 to 3 the ventricular volume decreases as blood is ejected into the afterload reservoir at\nconstant pressure, Pa. Ejection continues until the systolic pressure-volume curve is reached at\npoint 3. From 3 to 4 the pressure drops during the isovolumetric relaxation phase when aortic and\nmitral valves are closed. At point 4 the mitral valve opens and filling takes place at constant\npressure, Pf, until the volume again reaches point 1 on the diastolic pressure-volume curve.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 25\nCardiac cycle with constant preload, Pf, and constant afterload, Pa\nPa\nP, v\nPf\nFigure 26\nPressure-volume loop during constant pre- and afterload\nPressure (mmHg)\nVolume (cc)\nVd\ns\nPa\nPf\nVd\nd 50\n\nFigure 27\nLeft ventricular (LV), aortic, and left atrial (LA) pressure versus time\nPressure\n(mmHg) 150\nP a\nPf\nTime\nLA\nAorta\nLV\nFigure 28\nThe LV pressure-volume loop when the heart is attached to the aorta\nPressure\n(mmHg)\n1′\ns\nVd Vd\nd 50\nVolume (cc)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nIf the heart functions within the intact circulation the LV preload is determined by the left\natrial pressure, and the afterload is determined by the pressure in the aorta. Figure 27 shows the\npressures in LA, LV, and aorta as a function of time. The corresponding LV pressure-volume loop\nis shown as 1-2-3-4-5 in Figure 28. (These key pressure-volume points are also indicated in\nFigure 27.)\nDuring diastole, the ventricle fills from point (5) to point (1) along its diastolic curve. The\nend-diastolic pressure at point (1) is the preload. Systole begins, and the ventricle begins to\ncontract, thus increasing its pressure, but since both mitral and aortic valves remain closed, the\nventricular volume remains constant (isovolumetric contraction). At point (2), the intraventricular\npressure exceeds aortic pressure and ejection begins. The pressure at point (2) is the afterload.\nThe maximum pressure is reached at point (3), and is called \"systolic BP\" when measured in\narteries.\nAt the end of systole, point (4), the ventricular volume and pressure are defined by the\nsystolic ventricular function curve. Diastole then begins, with isovolumetric relaxation of the\nventricle to point (5) where filling begins again. Notice that the same amount of blood is pumped\nout of the heart during systole as enters during diastole. If diastolic flow into the heart increases\n(assume an end-diastolic volume of 170 ml), then the end-diastolic operating point would be at\n(1)′--an increased preload. If systolic ejection occurs at the same afterload, all of this blood is\nejected and the end-systolic point is again at (4). Since the stroke volume has increased, the work\nperformed by the heart during the new cycle has also increased. Note that stroke work, pdV\n∫\n, is\nsimply the area enclosed by the P-V loop.\n3. Contractility\nIn the intact organism Starling's law of the heart probably plays a rather minor role in\nchanging cardiac output to meet the varying needs of the body. The law's major value is probably\nin balancing the outputs of the right and left ventricles on a beat-by-beat basis.\nHow, then, does the body increase cardiac output to meet increased metabolic needs, as\nduring exercise, for example? Cardiac output increases dramatically, but the ventricular filling\npressure and volume typically show no increases. Rather, the ventricular pressure-volume\nrelationship actually changes so that for the same filling volume, a greater pressure is developed.\n(See Figure 29.) The heart becomes a more powerful or more \"contractile\" pump. Changes in\n1It is probably more precise to consider wall tensile stress (tension per unit cross sectional area) as the afterload\nrather than ventricular pressure. The same ventricular pressure would lead to a greater afterload if the radius of the\nheart were larger, and vice versa. If we consider wall thickness as well, then hypertrophy may actually reduce the\nafterload of individual fibers.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\ncardiac contractility are mediated by physiologic signals extrinsic to the heart that are carried by the\nautonomic nervous system, hormones, or by drugs. Contractility changes may also be caused by\ndisease.\nFigure 29 illustrates how changes in contractility result in shifts of the ventricular end-\nsystolic function curve.\nFigure 29\nIncreasing\nB\nA\nC\nD\nDecreasing\nDiastolic\nV2\nV0 V1\nV3\nP0\nP1\nP3\nP4\nContractility\nContractility\nFilling Curve\nVentricular Pressure\nVentricular Volume\nA shift in the curve upward and to the left represents an increase in contractility and vice\nversa. Notice that we may cause an increase in isovolumetric end systolic pressure by moving\nalong curve 1 from A to B. This corresponds, of course, to increasing the preload from P0 to P1,\nand involves no change in cardiac contractility. If, by virtue of an extrinsic influence on the heart,\nventricular contractility increases (curve 2), the same increase in systolic pressure may be achieved\nat a net decrease in filling pressure (point C). In general, changes in contractility occur in the intact\nanimal to meet changes in demands. Extrinsic influences may also decrease contractility (curve 3).\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nIn this case, a large increase in preload would be required just to maintain the same end systolic\npressure (point D). Disease and certain drugs may cause such decreases in contractility. Any\nagent causing an increase in contractility is called a positive inotropic agent and vice versa.\nThe diastolic pressure-volume curve is a measure of the mechanical stiffness of the heart\nduring its resting phase. The relaxation of muscle follows the active removal of calcium ions from\nthe region of the contractile apparatus by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, it is an energy-\nrequiring process. The diastolic properties of the heart may be significantly affected by a variety of\npathologic conditions which alter the mechanical properties of the ventricle either through changes\nin structure (constrictive pericardial disease, cardiac tamondade, dilated cardiomyopathy, etc.) or\nfunction (ischemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). For example, Figure 30 illustrates the increase\nin diastolic stiffness associated with transient lack of blood flow to the heart due to coronary artery\ndisease. The increase in diastolic stiffness reflects a relative lack of ATP that is required for muscle\nrelaxation.\nFigure 30\nAngina\nControl\nPressure (mmHg)\nVolume (ml)\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Grossman and Barry, 1980.\nLeft ventricular diastolic pressure-volume plots in control (open circles) and post-pacing (closed circles) periods in a\npatient with coronary heart disease who developed angina during atrial pacing. The entire diastolic pressure-volume\nrelationship is shifted upward, so that pressure is higher at any given volume. (From Grossman and Barry 1980.)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nB.\nModel of the Heart\nIn this section we wish to develop a simple model of the heart which will be intuitively\nreasonable, which will account for the input/output relationships of the heart on both a time-\naveraged basis and a beat-by-beat pulsatile basis. The model must also reflect the concept of\n\"contractility\". Our model is based on the work of Defares (Defares, Osborn, and Hara 1963),\nwhich was subsequently elaborated by Prof. Kiichi Sagawa and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins.\nSagawa has written an excellent review of ventricular models (Sagawa 1973), including that of\nDefares.\n1.\nThe Variable Capacitor Model\nBefore going to the modeling, an examination of some experimental data is necessary.\nFigure 25 shows a series of pressure-volume loops from a denervated canine left ventricle obtained\nunder different conditions of preload and afterload, but during a constant contractile state.\nFigure 31\nVentricular pressure (mmHg)\nVd\nVentricular volume (ML)\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Suga and Sagawa 1972.\nNotice that during diastole, there is an approximate straight-line relationship between\npressure and volume. At zero pressure the line crosses the volume axis at Vd, the residual (or\n\"dead\") volume of the ventricle when the transmural pressure is zero. Note also from Figure 31\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nthat the end-systolic points fall on a straight line which has the same volume intercept,2 but a much\nlarger slope.\nThis experimental data suggests that we may consider the left ventricle as a 2-state device.\nIn diastole it behaves as an elastic chamber (a capacitor) whose properties may be represented by\nthe diastolic pressure-volume curve shown in Figure 26. In the physiologic range, the curve is a\nstraight line, and its equation would be:\nV = Vd + CDP\n(30)\nNote that CD\nV ∆P , and is termed the diastolic capacitance (or compliance) of the ventricle.\n= ∆\nSimilarly, during systole the heart may be represented as a capacitor with value, CS. The pressure\nvolume relation would be:\nV = Vd + CSP\n(31)\nThis relation is plotted as the systolic curve of Figure 32. Notice that at high diastolic filling\npressures the diastolic pressure-volume curve is no longer linear. This occurs, however, at diastolic\nfilling pressures greater than about 20mmHg, which is above the normal physiologic range, and\nwhere cardiac dilatation begins to be limited by collagenous tissue and pericardium. Approximate\nvalues of the capacitances and dead volume for dog and man are shown in Table 5.\n2Note: for simplicity we will assume that the dead volume, Vd, is identical for diastole and for systole.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 32\nSchematic Ventricular Pressure-Volume Relations\nTable 5\nApproximate Values for Capacitances and Vds for Dog and Man\nDog\nMan\nVd\n5 cc\n15 cc\nCD\n4 ml/mmHG\n15 ml/mmHg\nCS\n\n0.1 ml/mmHg\n0.4 ml/mmHg\nSo far we have considered the ventricle to be a discrete two-state device with instantaneous\ntransitions from diastole to systole and back.

By\nmeasuring instantaneous pressure-volume relationships during systole, the function C(t) was\ncalculated, and the result is shown in Figure 33.\nFigure 33\nInstantaneous LV Capacitance, C(t) for the dog\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\nC(t)\n(ml/mmHg)\n2.0\n1.0\nt (msec)\nCurve calculated from data in Suga (1979).\nNotice that in this experiment C(t) decreases from its diastolic value over a 270 ms period, then\nrelaxes back to its diastolic value during the ensuing 135 ms period. The time to develop minimal\ncapacitance is approximately twice the relaxation period.\nThe instantaneous capacitance C(t) is independent of preload and afterload and\nprovides a complete quantitative description of the mechanical properties of the ventricle\nduring the cardiac cycle.\nWe will now proceed to analyze how we may utilize the instantaneous capacitance to\ncalculate the variables such as stroke volume and cardiac output.\nIn Figure 34 we plot C(t) for a number of cardiac cycles.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 34\nWe next analyze the pump function of the idealized LV when it is driven by a constant\npressure preload Pf, and when it pumps into a constant pressure afterload, Pa. To do so, consider\nthe following electric circuit model of the system.\nFigure 35\nElectrical Circuit Model of the Ventricle\nHere the open circles represent constant pressure sources. D1 is a diode representing the\natrio-ventricular valve; D2 is a diode representing the ventricular outflow valve. (A diode may be in\ntwo states: conducting and non-conducting.

During the period of diastolic filling, the capacitor has filled to a\nlevel:\nVD = CDPf + Vd\nNow as C(t) decreases below its diastolic value of CD, P(t) will increase above Pf, and D1\nstops conducting.

When Pf is large, we find\nexperimentally that the ventricular output curve flattens out (see Figure 38).

Such a plot is shown in Figure 40, using data produced by a computational model of the\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\ncardiovascular system (courtesy of Dr. Ramakrishna Mukkamala, 2000).

(Can you predict the change to be expected in the pressure-volume loop as\nthe contractility increases while keeping the preload and afterload constant?)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 43\nRepresentation of Contractility in the P-V Plane\nPositive inotropic drugs result in a decrease in CS while generally leaving CD unaffected.\nFigures 44 and 45 present experimental data showing that the positive inotropic action of\nepinephrine infusion leads to a clear increase in systolic \"elastance, e(t)\". Elastance is the inverse\nof compliance [e(t) = 1/C(t)]. Figure 44 shows that measurements of ventricular volume or\npressure alone cannot satisfactorily characterize ventricular contractility. At a fixed inotropic state,\nfor example, there may be wide variations in stroke volumes and developed pressures. On the other\nhand, plots of elastance (∆P/∆V) vs time reveal consistent changes with inotropic state. The\npressure-volume loops of figure 45 also demonstrate the unique value in using end-diastolic\npressure-volume ratios as a measure of contractile state.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 44\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.

One must obtain simultaneous measures of\nboth ventricular pressure and ventricular volume. In addition, these measurements must be made at\na variety of filling volumes in order to define the linear relation between end systolic\npressures and volumes which determines Cs.\nSeveral techniques have been used to achieve the required measurements. One approach\nmonitors ventricular pressure via a catheter-tipped transducer and determines ventricular volumes\nusing radionuclides. Ventricular filling volumes are varied by manipulating pre-load (nitrites) and\nafterload (nitroprusside, or α-adrenergic drugs).\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nA second technique makes use of the \"impedance catheter\". A single catheter measures\nLV pressures, and also estimates LV volume by monitoring the electrical impedance of the blood-\nfilled chamber. The resulting data may be plotted as P-V loops. The technique is useful in\ndocumenting relative changes in ventricular contractility induced by therapeutic maneuvers, for\nexample. Figure 47 shows the positive inotropic effect of dobutamine, and Figure 48 shows a\nsimilar effect of epinephrine. (In each figure, the control loops show the lower end-systolic P-V\nslope.)

Each pump is modeled as a single variable capacitor.\nFigure 49\nDiagram of the major elements of the circulatory system.\nThe elements enclosed in the dotted rectangle are included in the \"heart-lung pumping\nunit\".\nThis simple approach ignores the atria completely, and combines the effect of the atrial kick3 into a\nsingle pumping chamber. There is good experimental data to confirm the validity of using the\nvariable capacitor model for the right heart as well as the left (Sunagawa and Sagawa 1982).\nThe pulmonary vascular bed is modeled in the same manner as the systemic bed, although\nthe properties of the pulmonary vascular resistance differ (see below).\nIt is often convenient to combine the heart (both right and left chambers) together with the\npulmonary circulation as a single functional unit. This so-called \"heart-lung pumping unit\"\nwould be described in terms of a \"cardiac\" output, Q, and a venous filling pressure, Pf. The\ninteraction of the heart-lung pumping unit with the systemic circulation is of fundamental interest\nclinically.\nHow can we characterize the heart-lung unit? It is sketched in Figure 50. The preload to\nthe heart-lung unit (HLU) is the right atrial filling pressure, Pf, and the afterload is the aortic\npressure, Pa. A rigorous derivation of the properties of the HLU would require a detailed analysis\n3Atrial contraction does contribute to the efficiency of the heart by increasing the ventricular end-diastolic pressure.\nThe atrial \"kick\" may increase cardiac output by 15-20% under certain conditions of severe cardiac demand.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nof the pulmonary circulation. A simplified and somewhat qualitative approach will be developed\nhere.\nFigure 50\nThe Heart-Lung Pumping Unit\nThe right ventricle and pulmonary circuit are a low-pressure system. Normal mean\npulmonary artery pressure, PPA, is approximately 15 mmHg. The pulmonary vascular bed changes\nits resistance significantly as a function of flow rate. As the pulmonary artery flow increases (as a\nresult of somewhat higher driving pressures), its resistance decreases. The reason for this behavior\nis probably that multiple possible parallel pathways for blood flow exist in the pulmonary bed. As\nflow increases, more parallel branches are recruited, thus lowering resistance. In addition, the\nvessels dilate with increasing transmural pressure, also decreasing resistance to flow. Recruitment\nand dilation of vessels also occurs as the left atrial pressure increases. Permutt (see Sagawa 1973,\np. 46) suggested a model for the pulmonary vascular bed which consisted of a parallel array of thin-\nwalled collapsible tubes (Starling resistors). Alveolar pressure was the pressure external to the\ncollapsible segments. This model predicted a relationship between pulmonary vascular resistance\nand pulmonary arterial pressure which was highly non-linear. (See Figure 51a.) Experimental data\n(Figure 51b) seem to confirm this model.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nPVR\ncmH20\n( L/min\nFigure 51\ninf\n0.0437\n0.0250\nPLA\n∆ P/F mmHg\n( ml/min\n(\nLA 5.9-6.2 mmHg\nLA 7.9-8.7 mmHg\nLA 13.5-16 mmHg\n(\n0.0200\n0.0150\n0.0100\n0.0050\nPpa (cmH20)\nRight Pulmonary Artery Pressure (mmHg)\nA.

Compare the effect of left atrial pressure (LA) on the\nrelationship curve with that simulated by Permutt's model in Figure 51a. Palv = 5 mm Hg. (From Permutt et al.,\n1962).\nBecause of the non-linear behavior of the pulmonary resistance, the pulmonary artery\npressure is less sensitive to net blood flow than would be expected with a constant pulmonary\nvascular resistance. In addition, the relationship between pulmonary flow and pulmonary artery\npressure (or pressure gradient) is non-linear. Figure 52 demontrates the non-linearities in the flow\nvs. pressure curve for dog lung.\nPulmonary artery pressure is also relatively insensitive to changes in left atrial pressure, up\nto LA pressures of 7-10 mmHg. (See Figure 53.) This is because as LA pressure increases,\npulmonary vascular resistance decreases (recall Figure 50).\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 52\nPulmonary arterial pressure (mm.hg)\nImage removed due to copyright considerations. See Chapter 6 in Fung, Y.C.\nBiodynamics: Circulation. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1984.\nExperimental data and theoretical curves relating pulmonary flow and resistance to pulmonary pressure gradient. The\nexperimental data are from an isolated dog lung with pulmonary venous pressure fixed at 3 cm H2O, pleural pressure\nequal to zero, and three different alveolar pressures: 23, 17, and 7 cm H2O. The theoretical curves are based on a\nmodel of pulmonary alveolar flow developed by Fung (see Fung 1984, ch. 6).\nFigure 53\nEffect of left atrial pressure on pulmonary arterial pressure.\nNormal\nrange\nLeft atrial pressure (mm.Hg)\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Guyton.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nSince the pulmonary artery pressure changes little over wide ranges of flow, we will\nconsider it to be constant. Thus, the afterload, PPA, of the right heart is constant, and the RV output\nis determined only by the properties of the right ventricle, and the RV filling pressure, Pf. In steady\nstate the LV output must exactly match that of the RV. The left atrial pressure adjusts to the proper\nvalue such that the stroke volume of the LV equals that of the RV. Therefore, the output of the\nHLU (referred to as the cardiac output), will be\nC.O. = f CD\n(\nr Pf - CS\n(38)\nr PPA )\nwhere f is the heart rate in beats per minute, Pf is the filling pressure, PPA is the pulmonary artery\nr\nr\npressure, and CD, CS are the diastolic and systolic capacitances of the RV respectively. C.O. is in\ncc/min.\nNotice that the cardiac output is relatively independent of the left ventricular afterload. For\nexample, if the mean aortic pressure were to double from 100 mmHg to 200 mmHg, the left atrial\npressure would have to rise by only 3 mmHg (using values for cardiac capacitances given in the\ntable of normal values at the end of this section). This small rise in LA pressure would increase the\npulmonary artery pressure even less due to a decrease in pulmonary artrery resistance. The\nresultant change in RV output would be only about 5%.\nHowever, there is a limit to the extent to which increasing left atrial pressure will increase\nleft ventricular output. The left ventricle cannot be filled beyond some maximum volume, Vmax.\nThis limiting volume may be set by the mechanical properties of the ventricular\nmyocardium/pericardium, but in practice the maximal LV filling pressure is established when the\nLA pressure reaches the \"pulmonary edema\" threshold. At pressures higher than about 30\nmmHg, the hydrostatic pressure forcing fluid out of pulmonary capillaries exceeds the oncotic\npressure keeping fluid within the vasculature. Water then passes out of the capillaries into the\ninterstitial space, and actually into the alveoli of the lung, leading to the condition known as\npulmonary edema. When this condition occurs, gas exchange in the lung becomes impaired, the\nblood becomes hypoxic, and ventricular function deteriorates still more, which leads to still higher\nLA pressures and more pulmonary edema. This vicious circle is incompatible with survival unless\npromptly treated.\nWhen the LV diastolic volume reaches the maximum, then stroke volume cannot exceed\nl Pa\n(39)\nSVmax = Vmax\nl\n- CS\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nA plot of cardiac output as a function of systemic arterial pressure, Pa, is of the following\nform:\nFigure 54\nAt low and normal systemic arterial pressures, the RV determines cardiac output\nindependent of Pa. When the C.O. reaches f Vl\nmax - CS\n(\nl Pa ) , however, the LV begins to limit\ncardiac output because of its filling limitation. The LA pressure rises, causing concommitant rises\nin PA pressure, which limits RV output to that set by the left ventricle. Notice that as the LV\ncontractility decreases (increasing CS) the limiting cardiac output drops. Thus, the LV will limit\ncardiac output either at extremely high afterloads, or when LV contractility falls.\nThe equations which characterize the heart-lung-unit are shown below.\nI.\nRange I: Cardiac Output determined by RV Function\nC.O. = f CD\nr PPA )\n(40)\n(\nr Pf - CS\nVmax\nr\nwhen Pf <\nr\n,\nCD\nC.O.\nand Pa < 1\nl\nVl\nmax -\nCS\nf\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nor Pa < 1\nl\nr Pf + CS\nl (Vmax - CD\nr PPA )\nCS\nII.\nRange II: RV Saturates\nC.O. = f Vmax - CS\n(\nr PPA )\n(41)\nwhen Pf ≥ Vmax\nr\nr ,\nCD\nl\nr\nand Pa <\nl (Vmax - Vmax + CS\nr PPA )\nCS\nIII.\nRange III: LV Limits C.O.

In range II\nthe RV diastolic filling is maximum, hence the C.O. saturates (assuming PPA is constant). In\nrange III the C.O. is limited by the left ventricle. Normally the cardiovascular system operates\nin range I.\nThe equations above may be represented as a three-dimensional plot of C.O. as a function\nof Pf and Pa. An experimental plot of this sort is shown in Figure 55. The data is from open-\nchested dogs. The three operating ranges have been indicated on the curves, and show that\nexperimental data seem to fit our simple model reasonably well. Note that for the experimental\ndata, cardiac output was independent of mean aortic pressure up to about 150 mmHg.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 55\nCardiac output as a function of filling pressure and afterload (dog data)\n[Data from Herndon & Sagawa, 1969; figure from Guyton, Jones, and Coleman, 1973.]\n2.\nEffect of Intrathoracic Pressure\nUp to now we have treated the heart as it would behave in an open-chested animal. In the\nintact organism, mean intrathoracic pressure is about 6 mmHg less than atmospheric pressure. The\nheart senses only transmural pressures. For the same intracardiac pressure relative to atmospheric\npressure, the effective transmural pressure is 6 mmHg greater in the closed-chested animal than in\nthe open-chested animal. This effect is particularly pronounced with respect to diastolic filling\npressures since these pressures are normally only a few mm of Hg to start off with. Figure 56\nexplicitly includes the transthoracic pressure into the variable capacitor model.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 56\nElectric Circuit Incorporation of Transthoracic Pressure\ninto Variable Capacitor Model.\nCardiac Output (liters/min.)\nFigure 57 shows three cardiac output curves (at constant afterload) at different transthoracic\npressures for humans. In particular, we note that for the normal closed-chest situation there is a\nsubstantial cardiac output of approximately 5 L/min at zero right atrial pressure (relative to\natmospheric pressure). This is the normal operating point in the closed-chest subject.\nFigure 57\nEffect on the cardiac output curve of negative pressure breathing, positive pressure\nbreathing, and opening the chest to atmospheric pressure.\nbreathing\nNormal-closed\nchest\npressure\nbreathing\nOpen chest or\npositive pressure\nNegative\n-4\nRight Atrial Pressure (mm.Hg)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

These models both relate blood flow, Q, to the filling pressure of the right heart, Pf.\nThe two models may be combined as shown in Figure 60.\nFigure 60\nSince the Qs and Pfs are identical, we may now solve for the steady-state \"operating point\" of the\nentire system. Either analytical or graphical techniques may be used. In our analysis we will\nconsider mean pressures, flows, and volumes.\nB.\nNormal Functioning of the Cardiovascular System\nThe equation describing the heart-lung unit in Range I was given in equation 40 above, and\nis reproduced here. Note that we have explicitly included the effect of intrathoracic pressure, Pth.\nr\nr\nQ = C.O. = f CD (Pf - Pth ) - CS(PPA - Pth )]\n(43)\n[\nr\nwhen Pf - Pth < Vmax ,\nr\nCD\nl\n(Vmax - S.V. )\nand Pa <\nl\nCS\nThe equation governing the peripheral circulation was equation 23 above.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nEquations 23 and 43 may be combined to yield an expression for cardiac output.\nPms - Pth - PPA\nC\nr\ns\nr\nC.O.=\nRv + Ra\nCa\n+\nCD\nr\n(44)\nCa + Cv\nfCD\nIt is useful to put in numerical figures to estimate the importance of the various terms. Using the\ntable of normal values in Table 6 (at the end of the chapter), we find:\n8 + 5 - 1.5\nC.O. (cc / sec.) = .06 + .02+.05\n= 84.6 cc / sec.\n(45)\n= 5.07 L / min.\nBased on equation 45 we may examine the principal determinants of the cardiac output in\nthe normal physiologic range.\n1.\nHeart Rate. Cardiac output increases asymptotically with heart rate in this model.\nNotice that if the heart rate goes to zero, the last term in the denominator goes to infinity and\nC.O. goes to zero. As heart rate gets very large, this term gets vanishingly small and\ncardiac output reaches an asymptotic value of 8.6 L/min. in our case. (Note that our model\ndoes not take account of the drop in C.O. as filling time decreases.)\n2.\nMean Systemic Pressure, Pms. This term is the largest in the numerator, and is a\nmajor determinant of cardiac output. Since Pms is the ratio of distending blood volume to\ntotal systemic capacitance, a change in either of these factors will alter Pms and hence cardiac\noutput. Increasing blood volume, decreasing venous capacitance, or decreasing venous\nzero-pressure filling volume will lead to increased C.O.\n3.\nIntrathoracic Pressure, Pth. This term is an important one, and makes a major\ncontribution to cardiac output by virtue of its action on cardiac filling. (You should know\nwhat happens in a Valsalva maneuver.)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\n4.\nVenous Capacitance, Cv. This term appears explicitly in the second term in the\ndenominator (a small term) and implicitly in the definition of Pms in the numerator. As Cv\nincreases, C.O. decreases.\nr\nr\n5.\nRight Ventricular Diastolic Capacitance, CD. Increasing CD will increase the\nnumerator and decrease the denominator, hence increasing cardiac output (in a saturating\nmanner). (Generally this variable will not change, however.)\n6.\nArterial Resistance. Varying Ra has only a small effect on C.O. Ra enters only the\nsmall second term in the denominator. What effect does Ra have on Pa?\n7.\nArterial Capacitance, Ca. Since Ca << Cv, Ca essentially enters the second term of\nthe denominator in the form RaCa. Varying Ca will have a rather small effect on C.O.\n8.\nVenous Resistance, Rv. Increasing Rv dramatically increases the first term of the\ndenominator, and drops C.O.\n9.\nInotropy of the Ventricles. Under normal conditions the cardiac output is weakly\nr\ndependent on Cs and completely independent of Cs\nl. This reflects the fact that the\ncontractility of the ventricles is not the major factor limiting cardiac output; rather it is the\ndiastolic filling of the RV.\nC.\nCardiac Output Under Abnormal Conditions\nWe now consider the abnormal operating ranges of the heart-lung pump.\n1.\nRange II\nRange II is defined by maximum filling of the right ventricle\nr\n,\nPf - Pth ≥ Vmax\nr\nCD\n- S.V.\nVl\nmax\nand Pa <\nl\nCS\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nIn this range the left ventricular output is not constrained, but the R.V. has fixed output which\ndetermines overall C.O.\nr\nC.O. = f Vmax\nr\n(46)\n[\n- CS (PPA - Pth )]\n2.\nRange III\nThe system is in range III when the left ventricle is the limiting chamber in determining\ncardiac output. From equation 36 the maximum stroke volume obtainable from the L.V. is given\nby:\nl Pa\nS.V. max = Vmax\nl\n- CS\nThus, when\nl\nPa >\nl (Vmax - S.V. )\n(47)\nCS\nThe L.V limits cardiac output to:\nC.O. = f Vl\nmax - CS\n(\nl PPA )\n(48)\nBut\nPa = Pv + (Ra + Rv )(C.O.)\nIf we simplify this relationship by ignoring Pv and assuming Rv << Ra we obtain\nPa ≅(C.O. )(Ra )\n(49)\nSubstituting (49) into (48) we obtain\nC.O. =\nfVmax\nl\nl Ra )\n(50)\n(1 + fCS\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nThus, under conditions of LV-limited cardiac output, the cardiac output is a function of LV\nl\ncontractility, CS; peripheral arterial resistance Ra; and heart rate, f. Note that C.O. increases\nasymptotically with increasing heart rate; decreases with increasing CS or Ra. (See Figure 61.)\nInequality (47) is satisfied at either extremely high systemic pressures, or more commonly in left\nventricular failure when CS becomes larger than normal.\nIt is under these conditions that \"afterload reduction\" (decrease in Ra) is effective in\nincreasing cardiac output.\nFigure 61\nCardiac Output when limited by L.V. (Range III)\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nD.\nGraphical Solution\n1.\nOperating Point Analysis\nThe graphical solution for the steady-state operating point of the intact circulation makes\nuse of the \"venous return\" and \"cardiac output\" curves, and was introduced by Dr. Arthur\nCardiac Output and Venous Return\n(liters/min.)\nGuyton. Figure 62 shows normal cardiac output and venous return curves. The point of\nintersection is the operating point. Note that the steady state operating point is at a C.O. of 5\nliters/min. and a right atrial pressure of 0 mmHg (referenced to atmosphere in a closed-chest\nindividual).\nFigure 62\nCardiac output\n(normally)\n(normally)\nEquilibrium Point\nVenous return\n-4\nRight Atrial Pressure (mm.Hg)\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Guyton (1973), Fig. 14-1.\nIn the following section, we will illustrate the use of Guyton's graphical technique to analyze\nseveral specific physiological states.\n2.\nSympathetic Stimulation\n- Sympathetic stimulation has rather little effect on resistance to venous return, Rv.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\n- Sympathetic stimulation causes constriction of veins with a decrease in zero-pressure\nfilling volume, and increased mean systemic filling pressure--hence, moves venous return\ncurves up and to the right.\n- Sympathetic stimulation increases peripheral resistance, and the slope of the venous return\ncurve decreases. This is a small effect compared to the change in Pms, however.\n- Sympathetic stimulation changes the cardiac output curves by shifting to the left and\nincreasing the slope. This is due to increases in both contractility and heart rate.\nFigure 63 illustrates an analysis for the combined effects of sympathetic stimulation on both\ncardiac and peripheral factors. The normal operating point is at A, while with increased sympathetic\ntone, the operating point moves from A to C, and then to D. Notice that despite the increase in\ncardiac output, RA pressure drops. These curves do not show arterial blood pressure. What would\nyou expect to happen to blood pressure under intense sympathetic stimulation?\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 63\nCardiac Output and Venous Return\n(liters/min.)\nB\nA\nC\nD\nMaximum sympathetic\nstimulation\nMaximum sympathetic\nstimulation\nSpinal anesthesia\nSpinal anesthesia\n-4\nRight Atrial Pressure (mm.Hg)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Thus, if a vascular bed is perfused with blood with an O2\nsaturation of only 30%, a prompt vasodilation is observed. Hypoxia will shift the C.O. curve\ndownward and to the right--with severe hypoxia seriously damaging the heart's ability to pump.\nFigure 64 illustrates the impact of two degrees of hypoxia on cardiac output.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 64\n(liters/min.)\nC\nB\nA\nCardiac Output and Venous Return\n-4\nRight Atrial Pressure (mm.Hg)\nNormal\nSevere Hypoxia\nModerate Hypoxia\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Well-\ntrained athletes may increase their cardiac outputs by up to 6 or 7 times normal. Exercise can affect\ncardiac output in several ways:\n1.\nTensing of muscles, especially those in the abdomen and legs, can increase mean\nsystemic pressure, thus increasing venous return.\n2.\nAutonomic stimulation will increase mean systemic filling pressure and also\nincrease cardiac contractility and rate.\n3.\nIncrease in muscle metabolism causes local vasodilatation which decreases the\nresistance to venous return. The time sequence of the effects is shown in Figure 65.\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nFigure 65\nOnset of\nstrenous exercise\nCardiac\noutput\nHeart\npressure\nCardiac Output (liters per minute)\nResistance to\nvenous return\nrate\nMean circulatory\nMean Systemic Pressure (mm.Hg)\nResistance to Venous Return\n(dyne seconds/cm5 )\nHeart Rate (per minute)\n64 128 256\nSeconds After Onset of Exercise\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Guyton (1973), Fig. 25-2.\nThe graphic analysis shown in Figure 66 illustrates the net effect on cardiac output. The normal\noperating point is at A. At the onset of moderate exercise, the tensing of muscles leads to an\nimmediate increase in MSP from 7mmHg to 10 mmHg, and the operating point moves to B. Note\nthat the resistance to venous return on this venous return curve has increased slightly due to\nmuscle clamping. The CO increases from 5 L/min to about 6 L/min. During the next 15 to 20\nseconds sympathetic stimulation becomes significant, causing both cardiac and peripheral effects.\nBoth CO and venous return curves shift appropriately, and the next operating point is at C with a\ncardiac output of 8 L/min at an RA pressure of 0.

Introduction\nThe purpose of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues of\nthe body--particularly to the brain and heart. In general, the amount of blood flow to a particu\nlar organ is dynamically adjusted to meet its current metabolic need. The cardiovascular control\nsystems operate to establish the proper cardiac output and to assure its optimal distribution to the\nvarious organs of the body. The highest priority is to assure adequate perfusion of the brain, and if\nnecessary blood flow will be shunted from less critical organs to the brain.\nFigure 1 demonstrates that as the body's rate of oxygen utilization increases, the cardiac output\nmust increase in order to deliver the O2 to the tissues, assuming the arterio-venous oxygen content\ndifference is constant.1 In steady state, the rate of oxygen uptake, V O2, is equal to the cardiac\noutput, Q, multiplied by the arterio-venous difference in oxygen content. Experimental evidence is\nshown in Figure 2, demonstrating the relationship between cardiac output and oxygen consumption\nat various levels of physical exercise.\n· VO2\nQ\nHLPU\nQ\nCV(O2)\nCA(O2)\n·\nQ CV(O2) + VO2 = Q CA(O2)\n· VO2 = Q [CA(O2)-CV(O2)]\nFigure 1: Conservation of Mass Relationship\nThe cardiovascular control system is constantly challenged by a wide variety of physical and\nphysiological stresses. Some are transient and require rapid adaptive responses, while other stresses\nare more chronic and require slower (and more permanent) compensatory mechanisms. Table 1\npresents a representative list of challenges to the cardiovascular system. Adaptive responses to\nchallenges acting within seconds (such as standing or running) are mediated primarily by the au\ntonomic nervous system. Hormonal controls act within minutes to days, and would be expected to\nplay an important role in challenges such as blood loss, myocardial damage, or dehydration. Long-\nterm adaptations are required in response to long-term stresses such as severe physical training or\nhigh altitude living, and generally result in physical remodeling of tissue such as myocardium\nand/or blood vessels.\nCardiovascular control is best understood in the context of the parallel anatomical arrangement\nof organs as illustrated in Figure 3. The figure demonstrates that if the pressure in the aorta is main\n1While this assumption is not strictly true, it is reasonable for most normal operating ranges of cardiac output.\nControl and Integration\n\nDexter 1951\nDouglas 1922\nChristiansen 1931\nDonald 1955\nOxygen Consumption (liters/min)\nCardiac Output (liters/min)\nCardiac Index (liters/min/m2 )\nCardiac output and cardiac index\nOxygen consumption\nWork Output During Exercise (kilogram-metersters/min)\nFigure 2: Relationship between cardiac output and work output (solid curve) and between oxygen consumption and\nwork output (dashed curve) during exercise.

As we will see, a complex neurohumoral\ncontrol system is used to maintain a constant aortic pressure and to adjust the network of parallel\nresistances.\nThe control of the cardiovascular system is complex, and involves numerous biochemical, neu\nrological and hormonal mechanisms. The flow of blood to a particular vascular bed depends on the\nproper regulation of the cardiac rate and contractility, the intravascular volume, the venous tone,\nand arteriolar resistance. Some control mechanisms are quite local, and modulate arteriolar resis\ntance in response to the metabolic needs of the immediately adjacent tissue. These mechanisms are\nnot dependent on the autonomic nervous system or hormones, but are intrinsic to the local vascular\n6.022j--2004\n\nbed. This intrinsic regulatory mechanism is called autoregulation, and plays an important role in\nmost organs. Extrinsic regulatory mechanisms depend on complex neurohumoral mechanisms,\nand integrate the function of heart, kidney, and vasculature.\nVascular smooth muscle plays a central role in both intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mecha\nnisms since it controls arteriolar and pre-capillary resistance, and also modifies the zero-pressure\nfilling volume of the veins. Hence, we will next discuss some aspects of the physiology of vascular\nsmooth muscle.\n(\n)\n(\n)\nP\nH ead and Neck\nA rms\nL ungs\nB ronchial\nL eft A trium\nC oronary\nL eft Ventricle\nT runk\nHepatic\nSplenic\nM esenteric\nK idney afferent\nK idney efferent\nPelvic Organs\nL egs\nR ight A trium\nR ight Ventricle\nH epatic\nortal\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Smooth Muscle\nIntroduction\nSmooth muscle is present in the walls of most hollow organs of the body, such as the GI tract,\nbladder, uterus, gall bladder, ureters, and blood vessels (except capillaries). Smooth muscle is\nalso present elsewhere in the body, e.g. in the eye where it controls pupil size, or in the hair folli-\ncles where it causes \"hair-raising\". Changes in smooth muscle tension offset changes in internal\npressure, and/or control the diameter of hollow organs. In the GI tract smooth muscle coordi-\nnates peristalsis. In arterioles smooth muscle controls the resistance to blood flow. In venules\nand veins, smooth muscle controls the amount of blood stored--the zero-pressure filling volume.\nSmooth muscle is, therefore, of central importance to the control of the cardiovascular system, and\nis central to the understanding of autoregulation.\nSmooth muscle cells are characteristically spindle-shaped with single centrally-placed nuclei,\nand are typically organized into sheets. They contain the same basic contractile proteins as skeletal\nand cardiac muscle: actin and myosin, but rely on different regulatory proteins (calmodulin instead\nof troponin). In smooth muscle the contractile elements are not organized into the regular pattern\nof sarcomeres that result in the characteristic striations of skeletal and cardiac muscle. (Hence the\nname \"smooth\" muscle.) The smooth muscle contractile apparatus is demonstrated schematically\nin Figure 4. Bundles of actin filaments are attached to \"dense bodies\", some of which are adherent\nto the cell membrane. Smaller numbers of thicker myosin filaments are scattered among the actin\nfibers. Cross-bridges form between actin and myosin heads, and cyclic conformational changes in\nthe myosin result in contraction.\nRelaxed state\nContracted state\nContractile proteins\nFocal density\nAdhesion density\nCell membrane\nExternal lamina\nNucleus\nMyosin\nfilaments\nDense\nbodies\nActin\nfilaments\nCell\nA\nB\nFigure 4: Cartoons of smooth muscle cell. A. Physical structure of contractile elements. B. Contractile function.\n6.022j--2004\n\nTypes of smooth muscle\nThere are two types of smooth muscle in the body: 1) single-unit or visceral type, and 2) multi-unit\ntype. Single-unit smooth muscle is so-named because the individual cells are tightly coupled both\nmechanically (via desmosomes that transmit mechanical force) and electrically (via low-resistance\ngap junctions that transmit action potentials from cell to cell). Hence, single-unit cells function\nas a syncitium, much like cardiac muscle. Single-unit smooth muscle is found in most hollow\nvisceral organs and tubular structures of the body, including blood vessels. Single-unit smooth\nmuscle cells exhibit the property of autorhythmicity, resulting in spontaneous rhythmic action\npotentials and contractions that spread from cell to cell. The frequency of firing is increased by\nstretch. Figure 5 shows the spontaneous activity of visceral smooth muscle and that increased\nstretch results in increased frequency fo action potentials. Hormones from the sympathetic nervous\nsystem (norepinephrine) also cause increases frequency of action potentials and increased muscle\ntension. Under normal conditions visceral smooth muscle maintains a constant tension, or tone,\nthat is particularly important in the GI tract and in the vascular system.\nMulti-unit smooth muscle tissue is composed of cells that act as independent units. Each cell is\nindividually innervated, and the mechanical activity of the muscle is coordinated by nerve fibers.\nMulti-unit smooth muscle is found in such structures as the sphincter and ciliary muscles of the eye\nthat control pupil size, the large arteries, and in the piloerector muscles that cause erection of the\nhair and \"goose-bumps\". Multi-unit smooth muscle cells are not tonically active, do not respond\nto stretch, and are activated only via autonomic neural activity.\nContractile mechanisms\nContraction of smooth muscle is triggered by a sequence of biochemical events initiated by an\nincrease in the concentration of calcium in the cytoplasm. In common with skeletal and cardiac\nmuscle, contraction is initiated by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration from about 100\nnM (relaxed) to 700 nM. There are major differences between the two types of muscle, however,\nin the biochemical processes that control contraction, and also in the contractile dynamics. A\ncomplex array of electrical, mechanical, and humoral signals controls the intracellular calcium\nlevel. Although the major features are understood, unraveling the detailed mechanisms of smooth\nmuscle physiology is still an active research area.\nHow does intracellular calcium control contraction in smooth muscle?\nThe contraction of smooth muscle is accomplished by the same basic actin-myosin sliding filament\nmachinery as in other muscle types. The myosin head attaches to the actin filament, changes its\nconfiguration--thereby shortening the actin-myosin structure--then releases itself and repeats the\ncycle. In order to bind to actin, the myosin head must be phosphorylated. The phosporylation step\ncannot take place, however, without the presence of the activated form of the enzyme myosin light-\nchain kinase (MLCK) in the presence of ATP. The MLCK is activated by the regulatory protein\ncalmodulin, provided it has been bound to calcium. The concentration of intracellular calcium,\ntherefore, is critical in initiating smooth muscle contraction. Figure 6 reviews the sequence of\nbiochemical events leading to contraction, and Figure 7 illustrates in cartoon form the biochemical\npathways leading to smooth muscle contraction. Notice that the level of intracellular calcium\nControl and Integration\n\nW:L\nmV\n0.40\n0.64\n0.81\n0.91\n1.14\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\nsec\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 5: Action potentials and tension in a strip of intestinal smooth muscle showing increased frequency of sponta\nneous action potentials in response to increased tension.\ndetermines the amount of available activated MLCK. Note also that smooth muscle contraction is\ncontrolled by calcium-mediated changes in the myosin thick filaments in contrast to skeletal and\ncardiac muscle where the calcium-mediated changes occur in the thin actin filaments. Another\ncontrast between smooth muscle and striated muscle is that the latter contracts only in response\nto an action potential that triggers calcium entry into the cytosol from outside the cell and from\nthe SR. Smooth muscle cells also develop tension in response to an action potential, but may\nalso contract in response to calcium concentration increases caused by the opening of ligand- or\nstretch-mediated calcium channels.\nThe dynamics of smooth muscle contraction are two to three orders of magnitude slower than\nin skeletal and cardiac muscle.

Significantly, however,\nthe energy required to maintain tension in smooth muscle is much less then in striated muscle. A\nmuscle \"twitch\" may last from 3 to 30 seconds in smooth muscle, and in fact the smooth muscle in\nmany organs--including blood vessels--maintains indefinitely a continuous (or tonic) contraction\nwith minimal energy expenditure. The ability of smooth muscle to maintain tension with minimal\nControl and Integration\nMechanism of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Calcium enters the cytoplasm through voltage or ligand gated\nmembrane channels, or it can be released from intracellular stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).\nIntracellular store calcium release involves stimulating ligand activation of a series of second messangers to\nproduce inositol triphosphate IP3. IP3 binds to Ca++ receptors on the SR membrane and increases cytoplasmic\n[Ca++]. When cytoplasmic calcium reaches a threshold, contraction is initiated. Intracellular Ca++ forms\ncomplexes with calmodulin (CaM); a regulatory protein that activates the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK),\nwhich in turn phosphorylates one of the light chains of the myosin molecule and allows the myosin head to bind\nthe actin filament, causing muscle contraction. (From Barany, M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction.\nAcademic Press, 1996).\n\nenergy expenditure is called the \"latch\" phenomenon. A possible mechanism is that the myosin\nremains bonded to the actin but stops cycling.\nRelaxation of smooth muscle occurs when the myosin heads are dephosphorylated. This is ac-\ncomplished by the action of myosin light-chain phosphatase, an enzyme that is always present and\nactive in the cytosol. If the level of activated Ca++-calmodulin-MLCK drops, then the phosphatase\nwill dominate and dephosphorylation of myosin will occur. Since [Ca++]in controls the amount\nof activated MLCK, the calcium concentration is able to control muscle contraction and relax-\nation. So the key to controlling smooth muscle contraction is the control of intracellular calcium\nconcentration.\nFigure 8:\nHow is intracellular calcium concentration controlled?\nCalcium can enter the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells in two ways: it can flow down its con-\ncentration gradient from outside of the cell through specific transmembrane channels, or it can be\nreleased into the cytoplasm from internal stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Similarly, calcium\ncan be removed from the cytoplasm by actively pumping it out of the cell, or into the intracel-\nlular reservoirs of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. At any time, therefore, the intracellular calcium\nconcentration is established by the balance between calcium inflow and outflow. The channels and\npumps in the cell membrane and SR are complex, and are controlled by a wide variety of electrical,\nmechanical, and humoral factors.\nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a storage depot for calcium within the cell. Release of\nSR calcium into the cytoplasm is controlled by a second messenger system triggered by hormones\nor neurotransmitters that attach to specific receptors on the cell membrane. For example, the\nsympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine binds to the α1 adrenoceptor on the cell membrane\nand initiates a sequence of reactions mediated by G proteins resulting in the formation of inositol\ntriphosphate (IP3) that binds to a specific receptor on the SR, causing release of Ca++ into the\n6.022j--2004\nVOC\nROC\nMembrane\nDepolarization\nAgonist\nSR\nPIP\nP\nDAG\nPK C\nIP\nPLC\nGa\nCa2+\nCa2+\nCa2+\nCa2+\n+\n+\n+\nNA\nET\nANG II\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nAgonists such as norepinephrine (NA), endothelin (ET), and angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulate Ca++\nrelease from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by binding G protein coupled receptors, activating phospholipase C\n(PLC) and causing inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation. Calcium can also enter the cytoplasm through\nreceptor operated channels (ROC) or voltage operated channels (VOC).\n\ncytoplasm. (See Table 2 and Figure 8.) The SR membrane also contains active pumps that transport\nintracellular Ca++ back into the SR.\nFigure 9: Control of calcium across the cell membrane (see text).\nCalcium movement across the cell membrane is controlled by pumps that move calcium out of\nthe cell, and by calcium channels that control its inflow into the cell. (See Figure 9.) There are two\nsarcolemma calcium pumps. One is powered by ATP and moves calcium ion out of the cell against\nits electrochemical gradient. The second pump is the Ca++/Na+ exchanger in which one Ca++ is\nmoved out of the cell in exchange for 3 Na+ ions moving in. The energy for this pump is derived\nfrom the sodium electrochemical gradient. The calcium channels, when open, permit calcium to\nflow down its electrochemical gradient into the cell. There are three types of calcium channels:\n1. voltage-dependent channels in which the permeability of the channel is controlled by the\nmembrane potential (tension is roughly proportional to the degree of membrane depolariza-\ntion in a continuous manner, see Figure 10);\n2. receptor-operated channels that are opened when an agonist binds to the channel receptor;\nand\n3. stretch-activated channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the cell.\nClearly the mechanical behavior of smooth muscle is incredibly complex, and is under the\ncontrol of a host of mechanical, electrical, and humoral factors, many of which interact. Thus,\nthe smooth muscle cell integrates many different inputs. Some signals may be carried from dis-\ntant locations by nerve impulses or by hormones (norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, an-\ngiotensin II etc.), while other signals ([H+], adenosine,etc.) may reflect the metabolic state of\nControl and Integration\nExtracellular Space\nIntracellular Space\nCa/Na - Exchanger\n(Cytosol)\n3Na\nCa\n1Ca\n++\n++\n++\n1Ca\nCa\n++\n+\n2+\nChannel\nCa-ATPase\n(ATP ADP)\n10 Mol/L Ca\n10 Mol/L Ca\n-7\n-3\n2+\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nNE\n300 nM\nT (dynes)\n10-8\nc\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\nEm (mV)\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\nTime (min.)\nEm (mV)\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 10:\nimmediately adjacent tissues.

Intrinsic Regulation--Autoregulation\nIntroduction\nIn many organs blood flow appears to be regulated to meet the immediate metabolic needs of the\ntissue, such that even under wide variations of perfusion pressure flow is adjusted appropriately.\nThis behavior is independent of neurohumoral control, yet clearly involves changes in vascular\nresistance. The phenomenon is referred to as autoregulation, and is illustrated in Figure 11. Skele\ntal muscle in the hind limb of a dog was isolated from the rest of the animal, and was perfused\nfrom a constant pressure source. The metabolic state was constant. From a baseline of 100 mmHg\nthe perfusion pressure was suddenly increased or decreased, and the flow rate was monitored. The\nflows immediately following the pressure changes (transient flows) are plotted as open circles. The\nsteady-state flows (after 30-60 seconds) are plotted as closed circles. Notice that in response to a\nstep increase in perfusion pressure from 100 mmHg to 120 mmHg the flow increases immediately\nfrom 2 to 6 ml/min/100gm of tissue. The immediate increase in flow is partly explained by the\nincrease in perfusion pressure, and partly due to a significant decrease in vascular resistance. The\nresistance at baseline is 100/2 ∼ 50 mmHg/ml/min. The resistance immediately after the step in\nperfusion pressure drops to 120/6 ∼ 20 mmHg/ml/min. The decrease in resistance is caused by\ndilation of the arteries and arterioles by the increased transmural pressure. However, the flow then\ndrops back to nearly the original flow rate, and the estimated resistance increases to 120/2.2 ∼ 54\nmmHg/ml/min; slightly higher than at baseline. When perfusion pressure dropped to 50 mmHg,\nflow actually ceased, suggesting that the arterioles actually developed infinite resistance due to col\nlapse. However, during the following 30 seconds or so, the flow was re-established and approached\nthe baseline level. Clearly the arterioles in this experimental preparation are not behaving as pas\nsive elastic conduits! Rather, they appear to develop increased wall tension (\"tone\") after being\nstretched by an increase in transmural pressure, and to relax and increase in diameter after their\ninitial constriction (or even collapse) due to a sudden decrease in transmural pressure.\nMuscle Blood Flow (ml/min/100 gm)\nMasimum transient blood flow\nSteady state blood flow\nFlow with constant resistance\nFigure 11: Pressure-flow behavior in the\nisolated hind limb of a dog.

The dotted line rep\nresents the flow-pressure relationships\nfor a constant vascular resistance of 50\nmmHg/(ml/min)\nPerfusion Pressure (mmHg)\nThe temporal dynamics of autoregulation in the hindlimb are illustrated in Figure 12 that shows\nperfusion pressure, blood flow, and vascular resistance as a function of time after a step increase\nand decrease in perfusion pressure.

Hindlimb blood\nflow is represented by the solid curve, perfusion pressure is indicated by the long-dashed curve, and the calculated\nresistance is indicated by the short-dashed curve. Note the rapidity of autoregulation when the perfusion pressure is\neither increased or decreased.\nThe phenomenon of autoregulation is seen in many organs, including the kidney, heart, and\nbrain. Figure 13 illustrates autoregulation in the kidney. Renal blood flow remains remarkably\nconstant between arterial pressures of 80 and 200 mmHg, as does the glomerular filtration rate.\nRenal autoregulation is not affected by denervation of the kidney, but adding drugs that paralyze\nsmooth muscle abolishes it. The implication is that autoregulation is a local phenomenon that\ndepends on the behavior of vascular smooth muscle in response to stretch. It is independent of the\nautonomic nervous system and furthermore, the data from the isolated hind limb experiment rule\nout dependency on circulating hormones.\nMetabolically induced hyperemia\nIn the examples given, metabolic activity has been constant, as was the oxygen content of the\nperfusing blood. If metabolic activity of an organ increases, vascular resistance drops and the\nrate of blood flow to the organ increases (hyperemia). Figure 14 illustrates the effect of increased\nmuscular activity on blood flow to the calf of the leg during rhythmic exercise. Note that during\nthe relaxation phase of the exercise blood flow reaches levels of 15 times the control level. This\neffect is independent of the nervous system.

Cardiac output (blood flow\nto the entire body) increases in direct proportion to oxygen consumption, as was noted above in\nFigure 1. Blood flow increases in glands during active secretion, in the brain during neural activity,\nin the heart during increased cardiac work, in the GI tract during digestion, etc.\nCalf\nRHYTHYMIC EXERCISE\n(ml/100 ml/min)\nflow\nTime (min)\nBlood Flow\nFigure 14: Effect of exercise on blood flow in\nthe calf, illustrating the extreme dependence\nof blood flow on the degree of tissue activity.\nDots = mean rate of flow; crosses = flow dur\ning a few seconds relaxation; circles = flow\nduring sustained contraction. [Redrawn from\nBarcroft and Swann (1953).]\nThe resistance of a vascular bed responds to changes in the oxygen content of the perfusing\nblood in order to maintain an adequate rate of oxygen supply to meet the metabolic need of the\ntissue. Figure 15 demonstrates the increase in blood flow to the isolated hind limb of a dog when\nthe oxygen saturation of the perfusing blood is dropped. Note that the time constant of the vascular\nresponse is in the order of 20-30 seconds. Autoregulation tends to maintain oxygen transport\nto the tissue despite the changes in blood oxygen saturation. These observations suggest that\nvascular resistance is modulated by molecules related to local tissue metabolism. A number of\n6.022j--2004\n\ncandidates have been suggested, including CO2, O2, [H+] (lactic acid), [K+], and adenosine. Of\nthese, adenosine seems most likely. A reduction in local pO2 would lead to increased production\nof adenosine from ATP. The adenosine then diffuses to the adenosine receptor on vascular smooth\nmuscle (VSM) resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and lowered vascular resistance.\n30 % O2\nsaturation\n97 % O2\nsaturation\n97 % O2\nsaturation\nBlood Flow (cc/min)\nFigure 15:\nEffect of acute\nchanges in arterial oxygen sat\nuration on arterial blood flow\nto the hind limb of a dog. Note\nespecially the rapidity of the re\naction (Crawford, 1959).\nTime (min)\nReactive Hyperemia\nIf blood flow to tissue is stopped completely (or reduced significantly below steady-state values) for\na period of time (30 seconds to 10 minutes), and then the occlusion is removed, the blood flow will\nrise initially to very high levels, and then gradually return to normal. This phenomenon is known as\nreactive hyperemia and has been observed in most tissues--especially in skeletal muscle, cardiac\nmuscle and skin, and is illustrated in Figure 16. The phenomenon suggests that vascular resistance\nis under the control of locally-produced vasodilatory metabolites that accumulate during ischemia,\nand then get \"washed away\" to normal levels after flow is restored. The longer the ischemic period,\nthe more dramatic the reactive hyperemia.\nAutoregulation may be responsible for the so-called \"Anrep effect\" in the heart. It is observed\nthat when the ventricle is suddenly presented with an increased afterload the end-diastolic pres\nsure suddenly rises (as one would expect), but as the afterload is maintained end-diastolic pressure\nslowly drops--evidence of increased ventricular contractility. Why? The reason seems to be that\nduring the initial pressure rise there is a zone of relative ischemia in the endocardial myocardium.\nAutoregulation follows, with improved perfusion and concomitant improved mechanical perfor\nmance.\nFemoral arterial pressure (mm Hg)\nFemoral blood flow (ml/min)\nFigure 16:\nReactive hyperemia in the\nhindlimb of the dog after occlusions of 15,\n30, and 60 seconds.

Extrinsic Regulation\nIntroduction\nAutoregulation plays a significant role in the regulation of blood flow, but alone it is not sufficient.\nRather, an elaborate extrinsic control system exists which involves a variety of sensors and effectors\nlinked together via the autonomic and central nervous systems.\nIn general any control system must function to control some variable(s), and includes several\nfunctional components: 1) sensors or receptors to measure the controlled variable, 2) control logic,\nand 3) effector mechanisms. (See Figure 17.) In addition an appropriate communication system\nis required. What is the controlled variable in the cardiovascular system? Ultimately the system\nfunctions to regulate tissue blood flow such that metabolic demands are met. However, tissue\nblood flow per se is not actively sensed and controlled. Rather, the cardiovascular system regulates\narterial pressure rather closely, and controls regional blood flow by varying the resistance of the\nvascular beds as necessary. In addition, the system regulates blood volume to within narrow limits,\nbut the time constants of this control loop are longer.\nReference\nControlled\nError\nLogic\n-\n+\nEffectors\nSensors\nVariable\nControl\nFigure 17: Block diagram of a control system\nThe Communication System: The Autonomic Nervous System\nThe autonomic nervous system coordinates and regulates many of the body's organ systems, and\nits operation is usually at an unconscious level. The autonomic nervous system can be divided\ninto 1) afferent pathways, which carry information from organs to the brain, 2) centers in the\ncentral nervous system (spinal column or brainstem) which integrate autonomic responses, and\n3) efferent pathways which carry information to the various organs. The efferent pathways have\nbeen subdivided into two sections--the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system. A\nrough generalization would assign regulation of the base-line vegetative functions of the body to\nthe parasympathetic nervous system, and the mobilization of the body for emergency situations\nto the sympathetic system. Thus parasympathetic activity increases GI motility, gastric secretion,\netc. Sympathetic stimulation leads to increase in heart rate, rise in arterial pressure, and in general\nopposes parasympathetic effects. Most organs are innervated by both systems, and the net balance\nof sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity determines the behavior of the organ. Figure\n18 is a diagram of the autonomic nervous system.\nNote that the sympathetic efferent fibers exit from the central nervous system (brain and spinal\ncord) via the thoracic and lumbar spinal roots. The efferent pathway begins with a \"preganglionic\"\n6.022j--2004\n\nFigure 18: Diagram of the efferent autonomic pathways. Preganglionic neurons are shown as solid lines, post-\nganglionic neurons as dotted lines. The heavy lines are parasympathetic fibers: the light lines are sympathetic.\naxon whose nerve body lies within the spinal cord. This axon synapses with a \"post-ganglionic\"\nfiber that innervates the target organs. The synapses and postganglionic nerve bodies are located in\nclusters known as \"ganglia\". Many sympathetic ganglia are located close to the spine, but others\nare more peripheral (e.g. the celiac ganglion). Parasympathetic efferent fibers exit from the CNS\nvia the cranial nerves and via sacral spinal roots. The parasympathetic efferent fibers travel long\ndistances to the vicinity of their target organs where they synapse with short post-ganglionic axons.\nFigure 19 diagrams the neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system. Note that acetyl-\nControl and Integration\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\ncholine is the transmitter of the parasympathetic system and also of all ganglia. The acetylcholine\nreceptors in both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are of the \"nicotinic\" type, while the\nend-organ acetylcholine receptors are of the \"muscarinic\" type. The transmitter for the sympathetic\nnervous system is norepinephrine.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 19: The general wiring of autonomic effector neurons including identification of neurotransmitter agents at\ndifferent synapses\nTable 3 documents the responses of various target organs to autonomic nervous stimulation.\nNote that most organs have innervation from both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, and\nthat the \"operating point\" of the target organ is established by the balance of the two opposing\nneural inputs.\n6.022j--2004\n\nTable 3: Responses of Effector Organs to Autonomic Nerve Impulses\nADRENERGIC IMPULSES\nEFFECTOR ORGANS\nResponse\nResponses\nType\nEye\nRadial muscle, iris\nSphincter muscle, iris\nCiliary muscle\nHeart\nS-A node\nAtria\nA-V node\nHis-Purkinje system\nVentricles\nArterioles\nCoronary\nSkin and mucosa\nSkeletal muscle\nCerebral\nPulmonary\nAbdominal viscera; renal\nSalivary glands\nVeins (Systemic)\nLung\nBronchial muscle\nBronchial glands\nStomach\nMotility and tone\nSphincters\nSecretion\nIntestine\nMotility and tone\nSphincters\nSecretion\nGallbladder and Ducts\nUrinary Bladder\nDetrusor\nTrigone and sphincter\nAdrenal Medulla\nα\nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\nα, β\nα\nα, β\nα\nα, β\nα, β\nα\nα\nβ\nα, β\nα\nβ\nα\nβ\nα\nContraction (mydriasis) ++\n--\nRelaxation for far vision\n(slight effect)\nIncrease in heart rate ++\nIncrease in contractility and\nconduction velocity ++\nIncrease in automaticity and\nconduction velocity ++\nIncrease in automaticity and\nconduction velocity +++\nIncrease in contractility,\nconduction velocity,\nautomaticity, and rate of\nidioventricular pacemakers\n+++\nConstriction +; dilatation ++\nConstriction +++\nConstriction ++; dilatation ++\nConstriction (slight)\nConstriction +; dilatation\nConstriction +++; dilatation +\nConstriction +++\nConstriction ++\nRelaxation +\nInhibition (?)\nDecrease (usually) +\nContraction (usually) +\nInhibition (?)\nDecrease (usually) +\nContraction (usually) +\nInhibition (?)\nRelaxation +\nRelaxation (usually) +\nContraction ++\n--\nCHOLINERGIC IMPULSES\nResponses\n--\nContraction (miosis) +++\nContraction for near vision\n+++\nDecrease in heart rate; vagal\narrest +++\nDecrease in contractility, and\n(usually) increase in\nconduction velocity ++\nDecrease in conduction\nvelocity; A-V block +++\nLittle effect\nSlight decrease in contractility\nclaimed by some\nDilatation ±\nDilatation\nDilatation +\nDilatation\nDilatation\n--\nDilatation ++\n--\nContraction ++\nStimulation +++\nIncrease +++\nRelaxation (usually) +\nStimulation +++\nIncrease +++\nRelaxation (usually) +\nStimulation +++\nContraction +\nContraction +++\nRelaxation ++\nSecretion of epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine\nControl and Integration\n\nEffector Mechanisms\nThe extrinsic control system, acting via autonomic nervous system and hormonal pathways, can\nalter cardiovascular system performance via several distinct effector mechanisms:\nArteriolar Resistance\nUnder normal conditions the vascular smooth muscle in arterioles has a resting tension or \"tone\"\nestablished by a basal level of sympathetic stimulation.

Figure 21 illustrates in diagrammatic fashion that skin arterioles show the\nmost dramatic increase in resistance. Vascular beds in the brain show little response to sympathetic\ntone. (They respond primarily to pCO2 levels.) Muscle vascular beds will dilate when sympathetic\ntone decreases, and there is some evidence to suggest that some sympathetic fibers to muscle may\nactually secrete acetylcholine and have a vasodilatory effect that might be preparatory for \"fight or\nflight\". Vascular smooth muscle is not innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system except\nin genital erectile tissue (which receives parasympathetic vasodilator nerves).\nHormonal influences (see Figure 22): The adrenal medulla secretes mainly epinephrine (E),\nbut some norepinephrine (NE). NE exerts pure vasoconstrictor effects via α receptors. E acts via\nboth α and β receptors. In skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and liver, the β (vasodilator) receptors\npredominate; while skin, kidney and GI tract have more α (vasoconstrictor) receptors.\n6.022j--2004\n\nFigure 21: Diagrammatic representation of\nbasal tone and the range of response of the\nresistance vessels in muscle and skin to sym\npathetic nerve stimulation.

Splanchic veins (in the abdominal cavity) respond dramati\ncally to NE, the skin vessels respond strongly to temperature and emotion, and the veins in muscle\nbeds are heavily influenced by muscle contraction. The effect of venoconstriction is demonstrated\nclearly in the venous return curves (see Figure 27).

Thus, as BP\ndrops, sympathetic stimulation increases, constricting the afferent arterioles, causing a decrease\nin glomerular perfusion pressure. Also low BP results in renin liberation from juxtaglomerular\napparatus which acts on α2-globulin in plasma to produce the decapeptide angiotensin I, which\nis converted in the lungs to the octapeptide angiotensin II which liberates aldosterone from the\nadrenal cortex. The aldosterone cause increased sodium and water conservation (decreased urine\noutput). Finally, decreased blood volume causes secretion of anti-diuretic hormone which reduces\nurine output.

After Guyton.\n6.022j--2004\n\nSensors or Receptors\nThe cardiovascular control system includes a number of sensors which monitor several relevant\nvariables.\nLocal metabolic state\nAs discussed above local, metabolic state is sensed by precapillary sphincters. These sphincters\nrespond directly to local factors, and hence are part of the intrinsic rather than extrinsic control\nsystem. Nevertheless it is appropriate to note that overall cardiovascular control does, in fact,\nmeasure the state of local perfusion and responds appropriately to it, particularly in skeletal and\ncardiac muscle.\nPressure Sensors\nBaroreceptors play a very important role in the extrinsic control system, since they monitor central\narterial pressure which is a controlled variable. The sensors are stretch receptors located in the\ncarotid sinus and the aortic arch. (See Figure 34.) They respond to stretch of the arterial wall\ncaused by changes in the transmural arterial pressure. Afferent nerves from the carotid sinus (sinus\nnerve) return to the medulla via the glossopharyngeal nerves (IX), and the \"depressor nerve\" carries\nafferent impulses from aortic arch receptors to the vagus (X) and hence back to the medulla. The\nrate of firing of the afferent fibers is related to both the mean arterial pressure, and also to the rate\nof the change of the pressure. (See Figures 35, 36.) The baroreceptors are the primary receptors\nfor short-term, beat-by-beat control of the CV system.\nFigure 34: The location of baroreceptors and their innervation.\nThe baroreceptors are on the outside curvature of the aorta and\nsinus. The baroreceptor system ultimately uses the vagus and\nthe glossopharyngeal nerves to signal to the vasomotor cen\nters in the brain. 1, Aortic baroreceptors; 2, aortic nerves (de\npressor branches of vagi); 3, vagus nerve; 4, external carotid\nartery; 5, carotid sinus; 6, carotid baroreceptors; 7, carotid si\nnus nerves; 8, glossopharyngeal nerves.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nControl and Integration\n\nPhasic aortic\npressure\nMean arterial pressures (mm.Hg)\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nTime (sec.)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 35: Relationship of phasic aortic blood pressure to the firing of a single afferent nerve fiber from the carotid\nsinus at different levels of mean arterial pressure.\n1 sec\nMean Pressure (mmHg)\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Neil.\nFigure 36: Impulse activity in single fiber of left aortic nerve, and blood pressure recorded from left common carotid\nartery. Mean pressures in five records shown, beginning at top, are 125, 80, 62. 55, and 42 mmHg. (From Neil.)\nChemoreceptors\nArterial receptors that respond to changes in 02, CO2, and H+ ion concentrations are found in\nspecialized tissues near the aortic arch and carotid bifurcations. (See Figure 37.) Under nor\nmal conditions these sensors play very little role in circulatory regulation--and if blood gases\nare within normal range very few impulses are generated by these sensors. When blood gases\n6.022j--2004\n\nbegin to deviate from normal the respiratory response is constantly controlled by chemoreceptor\nreflexes. There receptors act as an \"emergency system\" for the cardiovascular systemin the pres\nence of severe perterbution of blood gases. The average chemoreceptor output impulse frequency\nis a function of both p02 and pC02, and is also modulated by blood flow through the sensor. (See\nFigure 38). The cardiovascular effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation are intense bradycar\ndia, arteriolar vasoconstriction, and increased adrenal secretion of catecholamines. Cardiac output\nfalls, but resistance increases such that arterial pressure rises. Interestingly, stimulation of the aor\ntic chemoreceptors seems to cause reflex tachycardia. Why the different sensors result in opposite\nreactions is not clear.\nFigure 37: The location of chemoreceptors and their innerva\ntion. The chemoreceptors are in the angle of the sinus bifur\ncation and on the inside curve of the aorta. The chemorecep\ntor system ultimately uses the vagus and the glossopharyngeal\nnerves to signal to the respiratory centers in the brain. 2, aortic\nnerves (depressor branches of vagi); 3, vagus nerve; 4, external\ncarotid artery; A, aortic bodies; B, carotid bodies.\nPercent maximum response\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nPaco2\nFigure 38: Average chemoreceptor impulse frequency recorded\nfrom multifiber preparation, expressed as percent of maximum\nresponse (ordinate), in relation to changes in arterial pO2 and\npCO2 (abscissa). (From Korner.)\nPa\n(mm Hg)\no2\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Korner.\nThe vasomotor center of the medulla apparently also has the ability to sense hypoxia or hyper\ncapnia (increased pC02). If the effective perfusion pressure of the brainstem falls below 50 mmHg\nthere is a tremendous sympathetic system response with maximum vasoconstriction in peripheral\nand renal beds, and cardiac stimulation. (This is the so-called \"CNS ischemic response.\")\nControl and Integration\n\nVolume Receptors\nRegulation of blood volume is, of course, of key importance to the body. If a bolus of fluid is\nrapidly infused into an animal, urine output will quickly increase to restore intravascular volume\nwithin a few hours. The sensors involved in the \"volume receptor reflex\" actually do not measure\nvolume directly, but rather respond to stretch or distension of walls of vessels or heart chambers.\nThe most important receptors are stretch receptors located in the walls of the right and left atria.\n(See Figure 39.)\n-30\n-20\n-10\nRelative impulse frequency\nECG\na\nc\nv\nAtrial pressure\nType A\nType B\nChange in blood volume (%)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Right: Relative frequency of impulses\n(ordinate) in afferent fiber from type B receptor when total blood volume was changed from its normal level. Change\nin atrial pressure in these experiments was approximately ±5 cm H2O for ±20% change in blood volume. (Based on\ndata of Gupta et al. and Paintal.)\nStretch receptors of similar anatomy to those in the atria have been found in the ventricular\nwalls, the pulmonary artery and the walls of the great veins of the thorax. Whether they play a role\nin the \"volume receptor reflex\" is not known. Impulses from volume receptors are carried to the\nvasomotor center in the medulla where several responses are elicited. In response to a decrease in\nvolume receptor neural output the following occur:\n1. Neural connections to the hypothalamus lead to increases in secretion rate of antidiuretic\nhormone (ADH), and in level of thirst. The result is decreased urine output and more drink\ning.\n2. Sympathetic stimulation of the kidney is increased, decreasing rates of urine flow and sodium\nexcretion. Also renin secretion increases, triggering a chain of reactions that result in fluid\nretention.\n3. Increases in the sympathetic stimulation to pre- and postcapillary resistance vessels reduces\ncapillary hydrostatic pressure thus resorbing interstitial fluid into the vascular space.\nSensors of Internal and External Environment\nAlthough the baroreceptors and chemoreceptors are the key sensors in the regulation of the circu\nlation, it is well known that a wide variety of situations exist in which signals from the external\n6.022j--2004\n\nenvironment or internal environment may alter cardiovascular function. \"Deep pain\" associated\nwith visceral manipulation, distortion of joints, testicular trauma etc. leads to the dramatic somatic\ndepressor response characterized by bradycardia, cold sweat, syncope, nausea, and weakness. Sen\nsors of external temperatures exist in the skin and lead to reflex vasoconstriction. Similarly, internal\nbody temperature is sensed by cells in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. We have already\nmentioned the ability of the medullary vasomotor center to detect and respond to ischemia of the\nCNS.\nFinally, the cardiovascular system responds to stimuli originating in the external environment\nand interpreted at the cortical level. Thus, threats as perceived via sight, sound, smell, etc. will\ncause dramatic cardiovascular responses. Obviously, a comprehensive understanding of cortical\nautonomic mechanisms is still beyond our reach, but it is clear that these higher nervous centers\nact continuously with medullary centers in control of cardiovascular function.\nCentral Control Logic\nAll levels of the CNS from cortex to spinal cord contribute to control of the circulation. The most\nessential \"control logic\" is at the level of the medulla oblongata and lower pons. This region--\nthe vasomotor center--is responsible for generation of tonic and reflex efferent impulses to all\nthe effectors in the cardiovascular system. Higher centers in the brain influence the CV system\nvia the medullary center--except for the sympathetic vasodilator pathways which originate in the\nmotor cortex. In broad terms, the medullary center functions to convert a particular combination of\nafferent signals from sensors into an appropriate set of effector responses. In general, blood vessels\nare controlled via the degree of sympathetic tone, and the heart is controlled by the interplay of\nvagal and sympathetic outflow.

The\nresults are shown in Figure 40. Note the decrease in post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve activity\nwhich corresponds to an increase in carotid sinus perfusion pressure. This drop in sympathetic\nactivity causes a drop in systemic arterial pressure as shown in Figure 41. Note that the rate of\nSystemic arterial pressure (mm Hg)\nGain\nFigure 41: Characteristics of baroreceptor reflex\nwhen carotid sinuses have been isolated from rest\nIsolated carotid sinus pressure (mm Hg)\nof circulation, while their innervation remains intact\n(\"open-loop\" conditions).

In skeletal muscle\nthe interaction and balance between extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms can be clearly seen. In\nresting muscle, neural control is dominant. In anticipation of exercise, blood flow increases due\nto cholinergic sympathetic stimulation. After the onset of exercise local metabolic factors result in\nvasodilation.\nReferences\n1.

Introduction\nPurpose\nThe Cardiovascular Simulator is a dynamic computer simulation of human cardiovascular\nhemodynamics, primarily intended for students of physiology and medicine. It is implemented on\nengineering workstations running the X Window System, allowing the student to perform a variety\nof measurements in a real-time simulated cardiovascular system, not all of which would be possible\nin an animal laboratory. The simulation is based on the lumped-parameter mathematical model\ntaught in Quantitative Physiology and Cardiovascular Pathophysiology courses in the Harvard-\nM.I.T. Division of Health Sciences and Technology. The computer simulation is implemented on\nthe M.I.T. Project Athena student computing network.\n2. The Model\nThe Basic System\nThe model which forms the basis of the simulator, based on an analog computer\nimplementation by Defares [1], is shown in Figure 1. The cardiovascular system is divided into four\nmajor sections: the left heart, the systemic (peripheral) circulation, the right heart, and the pulmonary\ncirculation. Each side of the heart is modelled by a variable capacitor, representing the pumping\naction of atrium and ventricle as a unit; two diodes, representing the atrioventricular and arterial\nvalves; and inflow and outflow resistances. In total, the blood storage capacity of all vessels are\nlumped into six capacitances (Cl, Ca, Cv, Cr, Cpa, Cpv), connected by six resistances (Rli, Rlo, Ra,\nRv, Rro, Rpa), and four ideal flow valves (Dli, Dlo, Dri, Dro).\nThe program calculates experimental data based on constituent relations for each element\nand the continuity of flow through the system, analogous to Kirchoff's Current Law for electrical\ncircuits. For the resistive pathways (resistors), flow is the pressure drop across the pathway divided\nby the resistance of the pathway, equivalent to Ohm's Law for linear resistors.\nQr = Pr/R\nElectrical Analog: i = v/r\n(1)\nFor the capacitative compartments (capacitors), flow is equal to the time rate of change of volume in\nthe compartment.\nQc = dVc/dt\ni = dq/dt\n(2)\nThe volume in the compartment can be expressed as the pressure times the compliance, plus the\nzero-pressure (atmospheric) filling volume.\nVc = PcC + V0\nq = vc + q0\n(3)\nTherefore, the change in volume is\n- 4\n\ndVc/dt = d(PcC)/dt\ndq/dt = d(vc)/dt\n(4)\nThis gives a complete equation for the continuity of flow:\nQc = C dPc/dt + Pc dC/dt\ni = c dv/dt + v dc/dt\n(5)\nThe lumped-parameter model is described fully by Eq. (5) applied to each of six circuit\nnodes, with initial conditions. These equations are solved numerically, giving pressure, volume, and\nflow through each compartment of the system. lnitial parameters are chosen which closely match\nexperimental data from the literature. The variable capacitances in the heart are driven by a pre\ncomputed time function, also derived from experimental data. The user of the simulator may modify\nall local and system parameters at any time; the instantaneous response to such perturbations can\nthen be visualized for any pressure, volume, or flow in the system.\nFigure 1. Circuit Diagram Equivalent of Lumped Parameter Model\nThe Baroreceptor Control System\nThe simulator incorporates a baroreceptor feedback control model in addition to the\nhemodynamics described above. The baroreceptor senses arterial pressure, Pa, producing an\nafferent signal, S, proportional to the deviation of Pa from the current setpoint pressure, Psp. The\nphysiological control pathways are described in Figure 2.\nThe control signal, S, is used to modulate autonomic activity to control heart rate and\ncontractility, peripheral resistance, and venous tone. We have chosen a proportional control law\nwhich updates HR, Cl sys, Cr sys, Ra, and Vv0 by adding to each of these parameters a deviation\nconsisting of a moving average of the control signal multiplied by a gain factor. The model is based\non the work of DeBoer [2]. Each limb of the response has a specific delay due primarily to the\n- 5\n\nresponse times of different autonomic nerve types and end-organs. Afferent nerve and central\nnervous system delays also contribute to delay in the control system (Table 1).\nNERVE TYPE\nLATENCY\nMAX RESPONSE\nLENGTH OF RESPONSE\nAlpha-sympathetic\n2.0 sec\n5.0 sec\n30.0 sec\nBeta-sympathetic\n2.0 sec\n5.0 sec\n30.0 sec\nParasympathetic\n0.0 sec\n0.5 sec\n1.0 sec\nTable 1.

This gross approximation may not\nhold for such a linearized operating-point control model; therefore caution should be used when\nmaking physiological inferences based on the control system model. For that matter, it should\nalways be remembered that the cardiovascular simulator is not by any means a complete model of\n- 6\n\nhemodynamics--it merely serves as a linear simplification to facilitate understanding the principles\nof the real, nonlinear system.\nREFLEX LIMB\nGAIN\nRESPONSE TIMING\nheart rate\n18 ms/mmHg\nbeta-sympathetic &\nparasympathetic\ncontractility\n0.007 ml/mmHg/mmHg\nbeta-sympathetic\nperipheral resistance\n0.011 PRU/mmHg\nalpha-sympathetic\nvenous zero-pressure volume\n26.5 ml/mmHg\nalpha-sympathetic\nTable 2.

The discussions of this section pertain to fluid flow in general and are therefore\nuseful in a much broader context than the more specific topics to be discussed in subsequent sec\ntions. For the sake of simplicity, however, some subtleties of fluid dynamics, which are of little\npractical import to blood flow, will be overlooked. Those wanting a somewhat more thorough\npresentation but still on an elementary level, should look in any basic text in fluid dynamics.\n1. Forces acting on a small element\nWe first need to establish a convention in referring to forces of various types which may act on\na fluid or solid element. If we isolate a small cubical element of some substance (as shown in\nFigure 1), we can distinguish three different types of forces. The first two act on the surfaces of the\nelement, and are by convention termed the pressure force (associated with the direction normal\nto the surface) and a shear force (acting parallel to the surface). It is often more convenient to\nspeak in terms of a force per unit surface area, termed the pressure ( p) and shear stress (t ) for\nthe normal and tangential directions, respectively. In three dimensions, it is necessary to identify\nnine stress components in order to completely define the state-of-stress at a point in the fluid.\nThese nine stress components comprise the stress tensor. We denote the various components of\nthe stress tensor by ti j where i is the face of a small cubic fluid element on which the stress acts\n(the \"direction\" of a face is determined by a vector normal to the surface), and j is the direction in\nwhich the stress points. For example, tyx is a shear stress acting upon the y-face in the x -direction\nas shown in Figure 1. The third type of force is a body force which acts uniformly throughout the\nfluid and is usually expressed in terms of a force per unit volume. Gravity is the only body force\nwe will consider.\nεyx\ny\nx\np\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 1: Forces acting on a small element. Pressure is normal to the surface, while shear stress is\ntangential.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\n2. The Properties of a Fluid\nWe can distinguish between a solid and fluid according to the response of a small element to a\nshear force. A solid will deform as the force is applied and maintain that deformation until the\nforce is released, at which time it will return to its original configuration. (See Figure 2.) This is\ntermed \"elastic deformation\". For an ideal elastic solid (a Hookean solid) the shear deformation or\n\"strain\" is proportional to the shear stress, τ. For small strains,\nl\nτ\nG\nG dγ\n=\nh =\nThe constant of proportionality, G, is the shear modulus of elasticity.\nIn contrast, if a stress is applied to a fluid surface, the fluid will continue to deform at a rate\nwhich is proportional to the applied stress. Here the appropriate constitutive relation is between\nthe shear stress and the rate of deformation. Taking the one-dimensional case of Figure 3, the rate\nof deformation, or the \"shear rate\", is simply the velocity gradient (du\nU ). The constant of\ndy\nh\n=\nproportionality relating shear stress to the rate of deformation is the coefficient of viscosity, μ. In\nthe one-dimensional case again, we can write:\ndu\nτx y\ndy\n= μ\nh\ndg\nSTEEL\nSTEEL\nl\nε\ne\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 2: An elastic solid deforms with shear stress but will return to its original configuration.\nεyx\nh\nU\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 3: A fluid will deform at a rate proportional to the shear stress. Here the shear rate is the\nvelocity gradient U/h.\n\nIn a so-called Newtonian fluid, μ is independent of shear rate (but can depend upon such\nparameters as temperature, and liquid or gas composition). Many fluids, however, possess the\ncharacteristic that μ changes as the shear rate changes and are therefore termed \"non-Newtonian\"\nfluids.\nA plot of shear stress, τ, versus shear rate is called a flow curve. Examples are shown in Figure\n4. Curve 1 is for a Newtonian fluid in which viscosity is independent of shear rate. The slope of the\ncurve is the coefficient of viscosity, μ. It has units of dyne-sec/cm2 or poise. Water has a viscosity\nof .01 poise or 1 centipoise. Plasma's viscosity is 1.5 centipoise, and that of whole blood is about 4\ncentipoise. Curve 2 shows a behavior seen in solutions of high polymers in which the viscosity is\na function of shear rate. In the curve shown, the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rates (a\n\"shear-thinning\" fluid). The fluid shown in curve 3 behaves as a solid at low levels of shear stress,\nbut begins to flow when some critical \"yield stress\", τy , is exceeded. If the curve were linear for\nτ > τy , the material would be known as a \"Bingham plastic\".\ng (sec-1)\nεY\nε (dynes/cm2 )\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Middleman.\nFigure 4: Flow curve of simple types of fluids.\nNote that viscosity is usually associated with the \"thickness\" of a fluid. Motor oil, for example,\nis considered much \"thicker\" than water, because it is highly viscous and doesn't flow easily.\nThe property of \"thickness\" is quite different from fluid density: both water and mercury are\nconsiderably denser than oil, but both behave as \"thinner\" fluids.\nAn effect associated with fluid viscosity is the no-slip condition. It is experimentally observed\nthat whenever a fluid is in contact with a solid surface, the fluid moves at exactly the same velocity\nas the surface. There is no slippage between the solid surface and the adjacent fluid. (This explains\nwhy moving fan blades can accumulate dust.) Ludwig Prandtl, in a classic 1904 paper, proposed\nthis.\n2.1 Blood as a Fluid\nBlood is a suspension of cells in a solution of electrolytes and proteins. Red blood cells (RBCs)\naccount for most of the cells, and occupy about 50% of the blood volume. (The percent of volume\ntaken up by RBCs is the hematocrit.) The non-cellular fluid, separable by centrifugation, is plasma.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nIf blood is allowed to clot, the remaining fluid is called serum, which is similar to plasma, but is\nmissing the protein fibrinogen. Red blood cells number about 5 × 106 per mm . They are disk-\nshaped, measuring about 7.6 μm in diameter and 2.8 μm in thickness.\nPlasma behaves as a Newtonian fluid. Whole blood, however, is non-Newtonian in its prop\nerties. Figure 5 shows a flow curve for whole blood. It is a \"shear-thinning\" curve of the type\nshown in curve 2 of Figure 4. Two phenomena explain the non-Newtonian flow curve of blood:\ncell aggregation at low shear rates, and RBC deformation at high shear rates.\nShear stress (dynes/cm2)\nShear rate (sec-1)\nFigure by OCW. After Charm.\nFigure 5: Dynamic equilibrium between cell aggregate size and shear stress applied.\nIn the presence of fibrinogen and globulin RBCs tend to form aggregates known as rouleaux.\n(In the absence of fibrinogen and globulin such clumping does not occur.) As blood flows, the\nrouleaux are broken up at increasing shear rates, resulting in smaller particle sizes and lower ef\nfective viscosity. An experiment done by Chien illustrates the mechanisms underlying the non-\nNewtonian behavior of blood. Figure 6 shows the relationship between the viscosity of several\nfluids and the shear rate. All of the fluids were suspensions containing 45% RBCs by volume.\nCurve NP is for RBCs suspended in normal plasma, in which aggregates may form at low shear\nrates. Curve NA is for RBCs suspended in 11% albumin (no aggregates can form). Curve HA is\nfor acetaldehyde-hardened RBCs in albumen (no membrane deformation possible). The data show\nthat the fixed RBC suspension has a constant viscosity at all shear rates tested.\nThe separation of curves NP and NA suggest that RBC aggregates are broken up to single-cell\nsize at shear rates of about 10 sec-1. The continuing decrease in viscosity as shear rates increase\nto several hundred suggest that the RBCs become elongated in the presence of high shear, thus\ndecreasing viscosity slightly. (See Figure 7.)\nWhole blood may be considered reasonably Newtonian for shear rates greater than 100 sec-1.\nEstimates of the wall shear rates in various blood vessels are shown in Table 1 below. In all cases\nwall shear rates are above 100 sec-1.\nThe viscosity of blood is a strong function of the hematocrit. Figure 8 illustrates the relative\nviscosity of blood as a function of hematocrit.

( What clinical implications follow? )\nFigure 9 also shows the increase in relative viscosity of blood as a function of hematocrit.

Res. 1:247, 1953.)\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nIn 1931 Fahraeus and Lindqvist measured the viscosity of blood, relative to that of water, in\nthin glass tubes at high shear rates. They observed a decrease in relative viscosity when tube\ndiameter fell below 0.3 mm (Figure 10). The explanation of this effect is the fact that RBCs tend\nto migrate toward the center of the tube, leaving a cell-poor layer of plasma (of lower viscosity)\nnear the walls.\nIt is also true that the effective hematocrit in the thin tube is lower than that of the reservoir\nfeeding the tube. (The RBCs at the center of the tube move faster than the plasma at the walls;\nthus, to transport the same ratio of cells to plasma through the tube, the concentration of RBCs\nmust be lower than at the feeding reservoir.)

Res. 3:6, 1971.)\n\nIt is the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect which explains the lower apparent viscosity of blood in the\nmicrocirculation as compared to the viscometer (Figure 9).\nFrom all of the above, we may conclude that to a good approximation blood may be\nconsidered as a Newtonian fluid provided the diameter of the vessel is greater than about 0.3\nmm., and the shear rate exceeds 100 sec.-1.\n3. Conservation of Mass\nIn addition to the constitutive relation just discussed (Eq. 2.), two other concepts are commonly\nused in fluid dynamics; conservation of mass and conservation of momentum. We sometimes also\nneed to invoke the equation for conservation of energy. In the context of flow through vessels of\nvarying cross-sectional area, the principle of mass conservation can be simply visualized. Take,\nfor example, the tube shown in Figure 12.\nFigure 12: Conservation of Mass\nA fluid region has been denoted by dashed lines having two ends which are perpendicular to the\ntube axis, and a curved lateral surface which we define as being parallel to the fluid velocity vector\nat every point on the surface. This is called a stream tube.1 In steady flow the stream tube can be\nthought of as an imaginary vessel, completely contained by the actual vessel. No fluid passes into\nor out of the stream tube through the lateral surface. Furthermore, if we choose the stream tube to\nbe very small, we can ascribe a single inlet velocity (u1) and a single outlet velocity (u2) to all the\nfluid particles passing through areas A1 and A2, respectively.\nConservation of mass then dictates that the mass flow rate through area A1 (ρu1 A1) must equal\nthe mass flow rate through area A2 (ρu2 A2) where ρ is the fluid density. In blood flow, the density\ncan be assumed constant, giving\nu1 A1 = u2 A2\n(1)\nConsidering the entire vessel as the stream tube, the same equation can be written, except that u1\nand u2 must then be thought of as average velocities over the entire cross-sectional area.\n1Another useful concept is that of the \"streamline\", which is an imaginary line that is everywhere tangent to the\nfluid velocity vector.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nZ\nI\nZ\nI\nZ\nI\nI\nHaving derived an equation for mass conservation for a simple, very specific case, consider\nnow a more general formulation.\nFigure 13: Mass Flux through an arbitrary control volume\nConsider an arbitrary control volume in a fluid with a velocity field Ev(x , y, z, t ) as shown in\nFigure 13. The mass contained within the control volume is\nm\nρ dV\n=\ncv\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid and dV is a volume element. The net flow of matter through a\ndifferential surface area d Ai , into the control volume is:\ndmi\nvi\nd AEi\n(2)\ndt = -ρ E -\nwhere vEi is the fluid velocity vector at point i , and d AEi is a vector differential area pointing in the\ninward direction. By integrating over the entire closed surface of the control volume we have:\ndm\nv\nd AE\n(3)\ndt = -\ncs\nρE -\nConservation of mass states that the time rate of change of the mass inside the control volume\nmust equal the rate of mass transfer across the surface into the control volume. Hence,\n∂\nv\nA\n(4)\nρE\n∂t\ncv\nρ dV = -\ncs\n- d E\nor\n∂\nρ dV\nρvE\nA\n∂t\ncv\n+\ncs\n- d E =\nIf we deal with incompressible fluids (such as blood) (ρ = const.) then the left-hand side of eq.\n(4) is zero, and we have,\nv\nd AE\n(5)\ncs\nE -\n=\n\nEr - E =\nZ\nAn alternative formulation, useful when the velocity field varies in both magnitude and direc\ntion, can be derived from equation 5 using Green's theorem, and states that for an incompressible\nfluid,\nv\n(6)\nThis is called the continuity equation.\nThe evaluation of the integral in equation 5 to the tube depicted in Figure 12 is quite simple if\nwe assume that the velocities are constant across each section:\nA1u1 -A2u2 =\nor\nA1u1 = A2u2 = Q\n(7)\nas in equation 1.\nA more general statement for this situation is:\nu(r )\nr\nconstant\n2πr E\nA\n- dE =\nEquation 7 states that in a conduit of varying cross-sectional areas, the flow velocity must vary\ninversely with the area of the tube. This principle may be applied to the circulation as a whole\nin order to estimate blood velocity at various points. The table below documents the geometry of\nthe mesenteric vascular bed of the dog. Note that the total cross-sectional area of the vascular bed\nincreases almost three orders of magnitude from aorta to capillaries. As shown diagrammatically\nin Figure 14, the mean velocity in the vascular tree varies inversely with total area. Thus, if the\nmean velocity in the aorta is about 30 cm/sec., it would be in the order of 0.3 mm/sec. in the\ncapillaries.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nTable 2: Geometry of Mesenteric Vascular Bed of the Dog*\nTotal\nTotal\nKind of\nDiameter\nCross-\nLength\nVolume\nVessel\n(mm)\nNumber\nsectional\n(cm)\n(cm3)\nArea (cm2)\nAorta\n0.8\nLarge arteries\n3.0\nMain artery branches\n5.0\nTerminal branches\n0.6\n1,800\n5.0\nArterioles\n0.02\n40,000,000\n0.2\nCapillaries\n0.008\n1,200,000,000\n0.1\n60 ⎫\n⎪\nVenules\n0.03\n80,000,000\n0.2\n110 ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪\nTerminal veins\nMain venous branches\n1,800\n⎬\n⎪ ⎪\nLarge veins\n220 ⎪ ⎪ ⎪\nVena cava\n1..2\n50 ⎭\n* Data of F.

Conservation of Momentum\n4.1 Differential Approach\nThe principle of conservation of momentum is no more than a statement of Newton's second law\nwritten for a particle of mass, m.\nFE = maE\n(8)\nwhere aE is the particle acceleration and FE is the total force acting on the particle. However,\nwe will find it more convenient to re-write the right-hand side of equation 8 in terms of the rate\nof change of momentum, where the momentum of a particle is equal to its mass times its velocity.\nFor fluids, we prefer to use the mass per unit volume or density, ρ, and also the momentum per\nunit volume, ρvE. Hence, equation 8 can be re-written as\nd\nFE = dt (ρv)\nE\n(9)\nwhere FE is the net force per unit volume and the right-hand side is the rate of change of momentum\nwith time.\nThe components of the velocity, u, v, and w are each functions of both time and position.\nHence,\ndu(x , y, z, t )\n∂u\n∂u ∂x\n∂u ∂y\n∂u ∂z\ndt\n=\n∂t + ∂x ∂t + ∂y ∂t + ∂z ∂t\n∂u\n∂u\n∂u\n∂u\nv\nw\n=\n∂t + u ∂x +\n∂y +\n∂z\n(10)\nwith similar expressions for v and w. Equation 10 may be rewritten with the help of the vector\nnotation � :\ndu\ndt = ∂u\n∂t +\n\nvE · �\n\nu\n(11)\n\nNote that the operator vE · � ( ) is a scalar, and is given in equation 12.\n\nvE · �\n\n( ) = u ∂( )\n∂x + v ∂( )\n∂y + w ∂( )\n∂z\n(12)\nThis operator is applied to each velocity vector component, and the total rate of change of momen\ntum may be written as:\nρ ∂\n∂\nvE\nt + ρ vE · � vE =\n(forces/volume)\n(13)\nThe first term is called the unsteady or temporal acceleration, and vanishes if the flow is steady as\nviewed by a stationary observer. The second term is called the convective acceleration.\nTo complete the description of fluid motion, we must specify the forces which are acting on the\nfluid. For blood and other \"simple\" fluids, there are only three forces of interest.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nh\n\ni\n\n- Gravitational force, which is simply ρ g per unit volume acting in the vertical direction.\nPressure forces.\n-\n- Viscous forces arising from friction between the flowing fluid element and its surroundings.\n4.1.1 Pressure Forces\nSince equation 13 is written in differential form, we are looking for the local forces on a small\nelement of fluid. The local net pressure force per unit volume which the fluid element experiences\nis simply the local pressure gradient. Consider first the x -direction.\nFigure 15: Pressure body force on a fluid element\nThe force per unit volume in the x -direction will be given by:\np -\np + ∂\n∂ρ\nx dx\ndydz\n∂p\n(14)\nfx,p =\ndx dydz\n= - ∂x\nIn more general terms:\nfEp\np\n(in three dimensions)\n= -�\nThe net viscous force per unit volume acting on the same fluid particle in one-dimensional flow\nresults from the difference in shear stress between the upper and lower surfaces.\nThe force per unit volume in the x -direction due to viscosity can then be written:\n∂τyx\nτyx +\ndy - τyx dx dz\n·\nfx,v\n=\n∂y\ndx dydz\n∂τy\n∂2u(y)\n=\n∂y = μ ∂y2\n(15)\nNeglecting some subtleties in the derivation, the vector force per unit volume due to viscosity in a\nthree-dimensional, incompressible flow can be written:\nfEv = μr 2 vE\n∂\n∂\n∂\nwhere\nr ≡ ∂x 2 + ∂y2 + ∂z2\n(16)\n\nFigure 16: Viscous force on an element\nCombining equations 9 - 16 we obtain the vector differential equation for conservation of\nmomentum, also known as the Navier-Stokes equation:\nρ ∂vE\nρ + μr vE + ρgE\n(17)\n∂t + ρ vE · � vE = -�\nWe rarely use this equation in its complete form, however, since very few exact solutions have been\nfound. Instead, we make various simplifications, appropriate for the problem at hand, to reduce\nthis equation to a more tractable form. For example, in cases of steady one-dimensional flow in\nthe x-y plane we can write (neglecting gravity):\n∂p\n∂2u\n(18)\n- ∂x + μ∂y2 = 0\nand\n∂p\n(19)\n∂y =\nThe velocity profile can therefore be obtained simply by integrating equation 18 over y and apply\ning the appropriate boundary conditions.\n4.1.2 Laminar Viscous Flow in Rigid Tubes\nAs a specific example, we will consider the problem of steady laminar viscous flow in rigid tubes.\nOne solution, following directly from equation 17 written in cylindrical coordinates is given in\nAppendix A. A simpler solution based on a direct application of equation 8 is given here.\nConsider a tube of radius a and length 1l, and a fluid of viscosity μ. (See Figure 17.) The\npressure at x = 0 is pa , and at x = 1l the pressure is pb. Consider the cylindrical shell control\nvolume of radius r , thickness dr , and length 1l. Since the flow is steady, there is no acceleration,\nso the total force acting on the control volume must be zero. Two forces must be considered: the\nforce due to the pressure gradient, and viscous forces.\nThe net force acting on the control volume due to the pressure gradient is:\n(pa - pb)2πr dr\nf p = (pa - pb)d A =\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nFigure 17: Steady flow through a straight cylinder, known as Poiseuille Flow\nThe net viscous force acting on the control volume would be given by:\nfv(r )\n=\n=\nfv(r + dr ) -\n∂\n∂r [ fv(r )] dr\nfv(r )\n=\n∂\n∂r [2πr 1lτ(r )] dr\nSince the flow is steady:\nf p + fv\n=\n∂\n(pa -pb)2πr dr + ∂r (2πr 1lτ(r )) dr\n=\nIntegrating once, we have:\n+ k1\n2πr 1lτ(r ) = -π(pa -pb)r 2\nSince τ(r )\n∂u , we have\n= μ ∂r\n∂u\nr (pa -pb)\nk1\n∂r = -\n2μ1l\n+ 2πμ1lr\nWhen r\n0, ∂u must be zero by symmetry, so that k1 must be zero. Rearranging, we have:\n∂r\n=\n\n∂u\n-(pa -pb) r\n∂r =\n2μ1l\nIntegrating again,\nu(r )\n-(pa -pb) r + k2\n=\n4μ1l\nThe second boundary condition is the no-slip condition, namely, u(a)\n0. Hence, we have\n=\n1 (pa -pb)\n\nu(r )\nr 2\n(20)\n= 4μ\n1l\na\n1 -\na\nThis is the equation of a parabola, and the velocity distribution is shown below:\nFigure 18: Parabolic Flow Profile of Poiseuille Flow (also called Hagen-Poiseuille Flow)\nWe may now calculate the total flow, Q, through the tube.\nZ a\nQ =\nu(r ) · 2πr dr\n=\nπ(pa -pb)a2\n2μ1l\nZ a\nr\n\n1 - r 2\na2\n\ndr\n=\nπ\n8 · 1\nμ · a4\n1l (pa -pb)\n(21)\nEquation 21 is the well-known Poiseuille's law which relates flow to pressure drop for rigid\ntubes. Note the division of the terms into a constant, a viscosity term, a geometric term, and a\npressure term. Note particularly the strong dependence of flow on tube radius, a. Equation 21 may\nbe written in the form\n1l\n(pa -pb)\nQ R\nwhere\nR\n=\n= π · μ · a4\nHere R is the \"resistance\" of the tube and is directly proportional to length and viscosity, and\ninversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. Thus, one would expect that the major\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\ncontribution to vascular resistance would be made by the small vessels. This is born out by con\nsideration of the following table. Note also that the strong dependence of resistance upon vessel\nradius implies sensitive regulation of flow is possible by changing vessel diameter through action\nof vascular smooth muscle.\nTable 3: Relative Resistance to Flow inthe Vascular Bed: Calculated from\nR ∝r\nTable 2 and Poiseuille's Law\nAorta\n4%\nLarge arteries\n5%\nMain arterial branches\n10%\nTerminal branches\n6%\nArterioles\n41%\nCapillaries\n27%\nVenules\n4%\nTerminal veins\n0.3%\nMain veinous branches\n0.7%\nLarge veins\n0.5%\nVena cava\n1.5%\nTotal arterial + capillary:\n93%\nTotal venous:\n7%\nAnother common simplification of the Navier-Stokes equation involves the neglect of all terms\ninvolving viscosity. This leads to:\nv\nρ ∂\n∂\nE\nt + ρ vE · � vE = -�p + ρgE\n(22)\ncommonly referred to as Euler's equation. When using Euler's equation we make the assumption\nthat the flow can be treated locally as inviscid. In this context the inviscid assumption simply means\nthat the pressure gradient is due primarily to the effects of inertia rather than viscous stresses.\nEuler's equation may be integrated along a streamline to yield\np + ρgh + 1 ρv 2 = constant along a streamline\n(23)\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid in grams/cc, v the velocity in cm/sec, p the pressure in dynes/cm2,\ng the acceleration of gravity (980 cm/sec2), and h the height of the fluid above some arbitrary ref\nerence in cm. Instead of gram-centimeter-second units, we may use millimeters of mercury for all\nterms (1 mmHg = 1,330 dynes/cm2). In the above expression 1\n2 ρv 2 is the kinetic energy per unit\nvolume along the stream line, while p and ρgh appear as the potential energy per unit volume\ndue to pressure and the earth's gravitational field respectively. It should be noted that the relation\nexpressed in equation 23 assumes no energy losses due to friction--it does not apply to viscous\nflows. It is known as Bernoulli's equation, and is an expression of conservation of energy. Its\napplication in situations where dissipation of energy is negligible is extremely helpful. However,\nyou should note that the absence of viscosity and thermodynamic terms indicates that this is not a\ncomplete energy balance equation. Several illustrative examples follow:\n1. Vascular Constrictions:\nConsider the simple example shown in Figure 18. A tube of varying cross-sectional area\ncarries fluid in a horizontal direction. We wish to determine the relation between p1 and p2.\n\n\"\nFigure 19: Manometry: flow through a constriction\nSince the tube is horizontal, we may neglect the gravitational term in equation 23. The\nequation of continuity permits us to relate the cross-sectional areas and velocities:\nA2v2\nA1v1\n=\nA1\nv2\nv1\n=\nA2\nBernoulli's principle states:\n2 ρv 1 + p1 =\n2 ρv 2 + p2\np2v1\nρ v\nv1\n=\np1 -2\n2 -\nA1\n#\np2\nρv 1\nA2\n-1\n=\np1 -2\nThus, in the narrowed portions of the tube, the pressure drops as the velocity increases. One\ninteresting physiologic application of this finding is discussed by Burton (Chap. 10 ) in\nconnection with the arterial narrowing due to atherosclerotic plaques. Consider the vessel\nshown in Figure 20.\nAssume the vessel's normal area to be A1, with a mean pressure of 100 mmHg and a velocity\nof 30 cm/sec (ρ ≈1). If the vessel is narrowed by the plaque to an effective area only one-\nninth as large as normal, what will the transmural pressure be at the point of narrowing?\nConsider also the possible disastrous results of capillary ingrowth or cracks into plaques as\nillustrated in Figure 21. How might such geometry lead to rupture of the capillaries into the\nplaque?\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nFigure 20: Flow past an atherosclerotic blockage.\nFigure 21: Pressure differential across an atherosclerotic plaque.\n2. Pressure Measurement\nIf an obstacle is placed in a liquid flowing with velocity, vo, the liquid must come to rest just\nbefore the obstacle, and the streaming is divided into two branches one on each side of the\nobstacle. The original parallel streamlines are deformed as shown in Figure 22.\nFigure 22: Stagnation point of a catherter in flow.\nThere is a stagnation point at the tip of the obstacle (v1 = 0) and by the Bernoulli theorem,\nρv 0\np1 = p0 + 2\nwhere p0 and v0 are measured well upstream from the obstacle.\nQuestion: Extend this reasoning to the problem of measuring pressures in the arterial system\nwith catheters. Compare the pressure readings which would be obtained from a catheter with\nthe opening facing \"upstream\" (end pressure) versus one with laterally oriented openings\n\n(side pressure). Consider Table 4 below, which shows the amount and relative importance of\nkinetic energy at different cardiac outputs. Note the rather significant effect in the pulmonary\nartery. (Here, however, catheter opening usually points \"downstream\", and would come very\nclose to measuring true pressure.)\nTable 4: Amount and Relative Importance of Kinetic Energy in Different Parts of the Circulation*\nResting Cardiac Output\nCardiac Output\nIncreased 3 Times\nKinetic\nKinetic\nKinetic\nKinetic\nVelocity\nEnergy\nPressure\nEnergy as\nEnergy\nPressure\nEnergy as\nVessel\n(cm/sec)\n(mmHg)\n(mmHg)\n% of\n% of\n(mmHg)\n(mmHg)\nTotal\nTotal\nAorta, systolic\n3%\n17%\nMean\n0.4\n0.4%\n3.8\n2.6%\nArteries,\nsystolic\n0.35\n0.3%\n3.8\n3%\nMean\n0.04\nNeg.\nNeg.\nCapillaries\n0.1\n0.000004 25\nNeg.\nNeg.\nNeg.\nVenæ cavæ\nand atria\n0.35\n12%\n3.2\n52%\nPulmonary\nartery, systolic\n13%\n52%\nMean\n0.23\n2%\n2.1\n13%\n* The cases where kinetic energy should not be neglected--that is, where it is more than 5% of the total fluid\nenergy--are indicated by italic figures.

Calculation of Valve Areas\nThe Bernoulli principle provides an approach for estimating the size of the valve areas using\ndata obtained via cardiac catheterization. In Figure 23 the chamber represents the ventricle\nduring ejection.\nFigure 23: Blood ejected during systolic out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve (A)\nFluid is ejected through the orifice, and the cross-section area of the jet is A. The pressure\ninside the chamber is po, and the velocity is vo. The velocity and pressure of the fluid in the\njet are v1, p1. Bernoulli's equation states:\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\ns\nρv 0\nρv 1\np0 + 2\n=\np1 + 2\nρ v\nv0\n1 -\n=\np0 -p1\nIf we assume that v0 v1, this equation becomes:\nρv 0\n=\np0 -p1\nv1 =\nρ (p0 -p1)\nIf the flow rate, Q, is known, we have\nQ\nAv1\n=\nQ\nA =\nv1\nSubstituting from above, we have\nQ\nA = k√p0 -p1\n(24)\nIn our derivation k\n√2/ρ. The form of equation 4.1.2 has been verified experimentally\n=\nfor diseased human heart valves, but the value of the constant, k, differs depending on the\nvalve involved. Q is measured in cc/sec; p0 -p1 is the pressure gradient across the valve in\nmmHg; k is 44.5 for the aortic valve and 37 for the mitral valve; and A is the valve area in\ncm .\nNote: Q is not cardiac output, but the instantaneous flow rate through the valve at the time\nthe pressures are being measured.\n5. Reynolds Number and Turbulent Flow\nA dimensionless parameter called the Reynolds number is used as a measure of the relative im\nportance of inertial effects (related to fluid momentum) and viscous effects. From equation 23\nit can be seen that changes in pressure due to changes in fluid velocity scale with ρv 2. Viscous\nstresses in a two-dimensional flow, as noted earlier, are equal to the coefficient of viscosity, times\nthe shear rate, μ du/dy, which can be roughly aproximated for flow through a tube by μ v/d. We\ncan form a ratio, which we call the Reynolds number, between inertia-induced stress and viscous\nshear stress of the form\n\nρv 2\nρvd\nvd\nRed ≡\n(25)\nμv/d =\nμ\n= ν\nwhere r ed is the Reynolds number using tube diameter, d, as the characteristic length, and where\nν is the kinematic viscosity (ν ≡μ/ρ).\nHigh Reynolds number flow (Red 1) is dominated by inertial effects, and vicous effects\nmay be neglected as a first approximation. Bernoulli's equation (eq. 23), for example, would be\nvalid when the Reynolds number is high. When the Reynolds number is low ( 1) viscous effects\ndominate.\nIn steady laminar flow, fluid particles move along well-defined trajectories or streamlines and\nno mixing occurs between adjacent streamlines. A different kind of flow results, however, when\nthe Reynolds number is sufficiently large; a flow characterized by apparently random velocity\nfluctuations superimposed (see Figure 24).\nu\nu\nt\nLaminar\nt\nu\nTurbulent\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 24: Reynolds number predicts development of turbulence in a given geometry.\nIn contrast to laminar flow, turbulence causes each fluid particle to move down the vessel in\nan apparently random fashion in which kinetic energy associated with the axial flow direction\nis continuously converted, first into a swirling or eddy motion, and finally into heat by viscous\ndissipation.\nTurbulent flow results from an instability of laminar flow and occurs at a value of Reynolds\nnumber which depends on the local geometry. For example, flow in a tube of uniform circular\ncross-section typically becomes turbulent when Red > 2300. In contrast, flow passing from a\n∼\nnarrow orifice into a larger tube or reservoir can become turbulent at Reynolds numbers as low as\n10. Judging from the range of Red given in Table 5 below (page 37), turbulence in fully-developed\nflow is not likely to occur in the venous circulation, but flow through venous valves or past vessel\nconstrictions could become turbulent.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nWithout going into a detailed description of turbulent dissipation and the pressure drops asso\nciated with turbulence, one general statement, derived primarily from experimental observations,\nwill be useful. Due to the internal dissipation of fluid energy associated with turbulence, an addi\ntional loss or pressure drop must be included in the mechanical energy equation. For a wide range\nof geometries, it can be shown that pressure changes due to turbulence vary as the square of the\nmean velocity.\nTurbulent blood flow creates mechanical vibrations in the walls of vessels. The vibrations are\noften audible through the stethescope (bruits or murmurs), or palpable (thrills). While turbulent\nflow is common in cases of narrowed heart valves or partial obstructions to arterial flow, it may\nalso occur in normal individuals when sufficiently high Reynolds numbers are encountered. This\nis particularly likely during situations of high cardiac output such as exercise, fever, anemia, etc.\nMurmurs heard in such cases are called \"flow murmurs\" or \"functional murmurs\", and are benign.\n6. Entrance Effects\nIn our discussion so far we have assumed steady viscous flow, and have derived the equation\nfor Poiseuille flow. This type of flow is sometimes called \"fully developed\" viscous flow in a\ncylindrical conduit in which the viscous drag from the walls penetrates throughout the fluid leading\nto a parabolic velocity profile. Clearly blood flow at the proximal aorta is not fully developed\nlaminar flow, since it enters the aorta as a bolus with a uniform velocity distribution over the cross-\nsection. As the blood flows down the aorta, the viscous drag from the walls has an increasing effect\non the flow. In particular, velocities near the wall tend to decrease, and the penetration of the drag\ninto the fluid increases as the fluid continues down the conduit. Eventually the \"boundary layer\"\npenetrates to the center of the conduit and steady laminar flow is established. (See Figure 24.) The\ndistance from the entrance to the point where fully developed flow occurs is termed the entrance\nlength, L E. The ratio Le/D, where D is the diameter of the conduit, is related to the velocity of the\nfluid. One might expect Le/D to be directly proportional to v and inversely proportional to μ. In\nfact, a theoretical entrance length which agrees reasonably well with experiment for non-turbulent\nflow is\nLe\nv Dp\n0.065Red\n, where\nRed =\n(Reynolds number).\n(26)\nD =\nμ\nFor the aorta v ≈25 cm/sec, D = 2.5 cm, μ\n4 × 10-2, and Red ≡1560. Hence,\n=\nLe\n, or\n250cm\nD =\nL E =\nThis result implies that the velocity distribution in the entire aorta will tend to be uniform over\nthe cross-section. Experimental results for dogs is shown in Figure 25 which show rather uniform\nvelocity distributions almost all the way to the iliac bifurcation. Note that the above analysis\nassumes steady flow, and we have used the mean aortic flow in estimating the entrance length. The\nimportant point is that even if we neglect the pulsatile component of the flow, viscous effects are\nnot important in the large vessels such as the aorta. They become important, however, in smaller\nvessels.\n\nRegion of flow establishment Region of fully\nwith nonuniform boundary\ndeveloped flow\nwith uniform\nEntrance length\nlayers.\nboundary\nlayers.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 25: Entrance effects.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\nFigure 26: Velocity distribution in the aorta of dogs.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\n7. Oscillating Viscous Flow\nFlow in the aorta and large arteries is clearly not steady, but rather is pulsatile. The question is-\nwhat is the nature of the flow? How much influence upon velocity profiles is played by shear\nstresses at the vessel walls? Is it possible to estimate where in the arterial system we might expect\nPoiseuille flow, and where to expect bolus or slug flow?\nAs a first approach to this problem, consider the problem of a one-dimensional oscillating plate\nimmersed in an infinite fluid. (See Figure 27.)\nFigure 27: Oscillating plate in an infinite fluid reservoir.\nThe plate, assumed to be of infinite length in the x-direction, and perpendicular to the xy plane\nis oscillated back and forth with velocity v0 cos ωt .\nIntuition permits us to predict the behavior of the fluid motion in some limiting cases. If ω\n0,\n=\nand the plate moved at constant velocity v0, eventually all the fluid would move with the plate at a\nvelocity, v0. On the other hand, it is apparent that as ω →inf, only an infinitesimal layer of fluid\nwhich clings to the plate at y = 0 would tend to move with the plate, and that fluid away from the\nplate would tend to remain at rest. For intermediate values of ω one would expect the viscous drag\nof the plate to \"penetrate\" the liquid to various distances. It would also appear reasonable to expect\nthe depth of penetration of the viscous effects to be greater as the fluid viscosity increased. We are\ninterested in getting a rough estimate of this \"boundary layer thickness\", and in applying the result\nto the vascular system.\nThe problem is solved as follows:\nConsider the control volume dx dydz at a distance y cm from the oscillating plate.\nThe equations of motion need consider only the \"mass × acceleration\" term and the viscous\nshear forces since the pressure gradient ∂p/∂x\n0.\n=\nMass =\nρ dx dydz\nAcceleration =\n∂u(y, t )\n∂t\nshear force =\n∂\n∂y [τ(y) dx dz] dy = μ ∂2u\n∂y2 dx dydz\nThe equation of motion becomes:\n\nr\n∂u(y, t)\n∂2u(y, t) = 0\nwhere\nν ≡ μ\n(27)\n∂t\n-ν\n∂y2\nρ\nThe boundary conditions are:\nv0 cos ωt\nu(y = 0)\n=\nu(y = inf)\n=\nThe solution to the differential equation is of the form:\nu(y, t)\nAe-y/δ cos ωt - y\n(28)\n=\nδ\nSubstituting back into the original equation, and recalling the boundary conditions we have\n2ν\nA = u0\nδ =\nω\n(29)\nWhen y = δ, the amplitude of the fluid oscillation drops to 1 of its maximum, and hence δ is a\ne\nmeasure of the boundary layer thickness.\nAn estimate of δ may be made for the cardiovascular system. Assume a heart rate of 100\nbeats/min. and a kinematic viscosity of blood of ν\n5 × 10-2. For H.R. = 100 beats/min.\n=\nω = 2π f ≈10. Substituting, we obtain\nδ\n0.1 cm\n1 mm\n=\n=\nThis implies that for large ( 1 mm) vessels such as the aorta the boundary layer extends only\na very short distance into the fluid. Thus, in the aorta the fluid tends to behave as plug flow, with\nrelatively uniform velocity distribution.\nUsing similar methods one may solve the problem of oscillating flow in a rigid tube. The\nmathematics is quite complex and not worth discussing here, but it does permit one to estimate\nboundary layer effects in tubes. The resultant expression for boundary layer thickness is identical\nto that of equation 29 above. It is emphasized again that fully developed laminar (Poiseuille) flow\nis to be expected only in vessels in the order of several mm. and less in diameter.\n8. Pulse wave propagation in arteries\nIn this section, we wish to develop a simple model which illustrates how pulse propagation may\noccur in the arterial system. We will represent the artery as a thin-walled elastic tube characterized\nby an equation of state relating the area of the vessel, A, to the transmural pressure, p,\nA = A(p)\nFor simplicity we will assume a linear operating region and define a compliance per unit length\nCu such that\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\n∂A\nCu\nconstant\n= ∂p =\nThis implies\nA\n(30)\n= A0 + Cu p\nConsider a section of vessel as shown in Figure 28.\nFigure 28:\nThe equation of continuity states that the net rate of increase in mass of the control volume,\n∂Q\nρ ∂A dx must equal the net inflow into the control volume which is -ρ\ndx .\n∂t\n∂x\nHence,\n∂Q\n∂A\n(31)\n∂x + ∂t = 0\nThe equation of motion equates the time rate of change of momentum to the pressure gradient.\n∂\n∂\nA)dx\n(p ·\n∂t (uρ Adx ) = - ∂x\nDifferentiating and suitably factoring we obtain:\n1 ∂u\n1 ∂A\n1 ∂A\n1 ∂p\nρu\nρ\nu ∂t + A ∂t\n=\n-\nA ∂x + p ∂x\n∂\n∂\n∂\n∂\nρu\nln u + ∂t ln A\n=\n-ρ\nln A + ∂x ln p\n∂t\n∂x\nsmall\nsmall\n\ns\ns\nWe will assume a small-signal case; that is, the variation in A with respect to time and space\nis small compared to similar variations in velocity u and pressure, p. Hence, we may neglect the\nterms containing ln A, and we have:\n∂u\n1 ∂p\n(32)\n∂t + ρ ∂x = 0\nMultiplying by A we obtain (noting that Q = Au),\n∂Q\nA ∂p\n(33)\n∂t + ρ ∂x = 0\nUsing equation 30, differentiating with respect to t , and substituting into equation 31, we obtain\n∂Q\n∂p\n+ Cu\n(34)\n∂x\n∂t =\nEquations 33 and 34 are similar to the equations governing lossless transmission lines, and\nρ/A may be identified as Lu , the inertance per unit length.\nIf the compliance of the vessel is assumed to be independent of pressure and location, and if\nthe area of the vessel is assumed to be constant (no tapering and small peturbations with pressure),\nwe may treat Cu and Lu as constants and solve equations 33 and 34.\nDifferentiating 33 with respect to x , and 34 with respect to t and eliminating the Q terms, we\nhave:\n∂2 p\nA ∂2 p\nCu ∂t 2 -ρ ∂x 2 = 0\nor\n∂2 p\nA ∂2 p\n(35)\n∂t 2 -ρCu ∂x 2 = 0\nSolutions are of the form\np = p(x -ct )\nThus pressure waves propagate at constant velocity, c, without distortion, where\nA\nc\n(36)\n=\nρCu\n=\nLuCu\nThis velocity is known as the Moens-Korteweg wave speed. The Moens-Korteweg relation\nship indicates a constant wave velocity in the arterial system. In man, pulse wave velocity varies\ngreatly--for instance it is about 3 m/sec. at the proximal aorta, and 8 or 9 m/sec. at the iliac\nbifurcation. Further, it is also true that the pulse wave distorts as it moves down the aorta. (See\nFigure 29.)\nFactors of importance which influence pulse propagation in the circulatory tree include: 1)\nvessel stiffness increases with pressure such that the peaks of pressure move faster than the low-\npressure points; 2) the arterial tree is tapered in area and wall properties; and 3) reflections may\ndistort pressure waveforms.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 29: Contour of arterial pressure pulse in various parts of aorta. Curve 0, pulse near root of\naorta; curves 10, 20, and 30, pulse at 10, 20, and 30 cm farther down aorta.\nIn general, vessels become stiffer with age as elastic tissue becomes replaced with collagen,\nand as arteriosclerosis becomes more common. As one would expect, pulse wave velocity in the\naorta increases with age. Also, since vessels expand and become stiffer as pressure increases, pulse\nwave velocity increases with mean blood pressure (Figure 30).\nAortic pulse-wave velocity (m/sec)\nPulse-wave velocity for thoracic aorta (m/sec)\nAge (years)\nMean blood pressure (mmHg)\nPulse-wave velocity versus age\nPulse-wave velocity versus blood pressure\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Fluid Mechanics of Heart Valve Action\n10.1 Aortic Valve\nThe aortic valve consists of three thin (0.1 mm) flexible, self-supporting cusps. Corresponding to\neach cusp, there is a bulge in the aortic wall called a sinus (sinuses of Valsalva). The coronary\narteries arise from two of these sinuses.\nFigure 31: Sinuses of Valsalva of the Aortic Valve.\nIn the normal valve, blood flow is laminar, and furthermore, the reversed flow is less than 5%\nof the stroke volume. The fact that flow is observed to be laminar despite peak Reynolds numbers\nof near 104 suggests that the normal valve offers no obstruction to forward flow. On the other hand\nthe very low reverse flow at the end of systole suggests the valve may be almost closed before the\nend of systole. It also seems important that the ostia of the coronary arteries not be occluded during\nthe heart cycle.\nThe movement of the valve cusps has been studied by Bellhouse by means of a model system,\nand they have demonstrated the importance of the sinuses. The observations are:\nAt the start of systole the valve cusps open rapidly and move out toward the sinuses. Vortices\nformed between the cusps and the sinus walls. The cusps did not flutter, and flow entered each\nsinus at the ridge, curled back around the sinus wall, and then along the cusp to flow out into\nthe main stream at the points of attachment of the cusp to the aorta. Thus, the valve leaflets are\nsupported, during ejection, between the main stream and the trapped vortices.\nAfter peak ejection velocity, as blood was being decelerated ( but still moving out of the heart),\nthe valve cusps move away from the sinuses, and are almost completely closed before the end of\nsystole. Reverse flow was less than 5% of the forward S.V.\nIf the sinuses are occluded, the cusps open and touch the walls of the aorta during systole, and\nthere are no trapped vortices. The valve closes by means of reversed flow above, and back flow\nincreased to 25% of the forward flow.\nThe action of the valve may be explained on the basis of local pressure gradients in the regions\nof the aortic root. During deceleration of the blood (latter half of systole) there must be a reverse\n\nFigure 32: Vortices in the Sinuses of Valsalva in Systole.\npressure gradient in the region of the aortic outlet.

On a somewhat less formal basis than the Navier Stokes equation above, he reasoned\nthat to maintain a steady flow in a tube, one had to balance the viscous forces retarding the flow\nwith a pressure drop from inlet to outlet.\nv\nIf we assume steady flow ∂\n∂\nE\nt = 0 and straight parallel flow [vE = u(x ), so (vE\nv\n0, then\n· �)E =\nequation 17 simplifies to\nv\n(42)\n-�p + μr2 E =\nFigure 35: Poiseuille Flow\nFor the geometry of Figure 35, equation 42 becomes (in cylindrical coordinates):\nd p\n1 d du\nr\ndx = μ r dr\ndr\n(43)\nThis is a separable partial differential equation.

Thus, one would expect that the major\ncontribution to vascular resistance would be made by the small vessels. Note that the mean velocity,\nv, is half the centerline velocity:\n\nQ\nv\n(48)\n= πa2 = 2 u(0)\nAlthough Poiseuille's law has many engineering applications, and although it gives consider\nable insight into flow in the circulation; nevertheless, it cannot be rigorously applied to the circu\nlation. It requires the following assumptions:\n1. The fluid is homogeneous and Newtonian. Blood may be considered as a Newtonian fluid\nonly if the radius of the vessel exceeds 0.5 mm and if the shear rate exceeds 100 sec.-1. This\ncondition, therefore, excludes arterioles, venules, and capillaries.\n2. The flow is steady and inertia-free. If the flow is pulsatile, the variable pressure gradient\ncommunicates kinetic energy to the fluid, and the flow is no longer inertia-free. This condi\ntion excludes the larger arteries.\n3. The tube is rigid so that its diameter does not change with pressure. This condition is never\nmet in the circulatory system, particularly the veins.\nMore precise models of blood flow in the circulation have been devised which take account of\nthe properties of vessel walls, inertia, pulsatile flow, etc.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

FUNCTIONS OF THE CIRCULATION\n(i) Transport: Supplies nutrients to various cellgroups. Removes wastes; distributes heat.\nMost important \"nutrient\" is oxgen (Figure 1). Other materials: CO2, amino acids,\nglucose, fats, hormones, ions, urea, cells, etc.\n(ii) Communication: Integrative communication via hormones\n(iii) Heat Exchanger: Distributes heat to skin, lungs. Controls dissipation\n(iv) Protection: Clotting mechanisms, transport of WBCs, antibodies.\nB. COMPONENTS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM\n(i) Major Components: Two pumps in series; major conduits; exchange mechanisms be\ntween intravascular and extra-vascular fluid; reservoirs for fluid storage (Figure 2); fluid\nmedium (blood). Physical characteristics of elastic arteries, collapsible veins, resistance\nvessels.\n(ii) Organization: High pressure delivery system, low-pressure capacitance system (Figure\n2). Parallel organization of supply routes (Figure 3).\n(iii) Some Numbers: Typical Dimensions, velocities, normal values (Tables 1, 2).\n(iv) Perfusion and O2 Uptake of representative organs (Figure 4).\nC.

The estimates are very rough, from data taken from many\nsources and not very consistent. The kidney is greatly overperfused; the muscles, underperfused.\nIn exercise the proportion of blood flow to muscle increases enormously, as it does for skin in hot\nenvironments.\nTable 1: Geometry of Mesenteric Vascular Bed of the Dog*\nTotal\nTotal\nKind of\nDiameter\nCross-\nLength\nVolume\nVessel\n(mm)\nNumber\nsectional\n(cm)\n(cm3)\nArea (cm2)\nAorta\n0.8\nLarge arteries\n3.0\nMain artery branches\n5.0\nTerminal branches\n0.6\n1,800\n5.0\nArterioles\n0.02\n40,000,000\n0.2\n25 ⎫\nCapillaries\n0.008\n1,200,000,000\n0.1\n60 ⎪ ⎪ ⎪\nVenules\n0.03\n80,000,000\n0.2\n110 ⎪ ⎪ ⎬\nTerminal veins\n1,800\nMain venous branches\n270 ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪\nLarge veins\n220 ⎪ ⎭\nVena cava\n1..2\n* Data of F.
