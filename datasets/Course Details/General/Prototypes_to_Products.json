Topics covered include prototyping techniques, materials selection, design-for-manufacturing, field-testing, and project management. All classwork will directly relate to the students' projects, and the instructor will consult on the projects during weekly lab time. There are no exams. Teams are encouraged to enroll together.\n\nRecommended Textbook\n\nUlrich, Karl T., and Steven D. Eppinger.\nProduct Design and Development\n. 3rd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2003. ISBN: 9780072471465.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nThis is a six-unit class: three hours a week will be spent in class and the remaining three hours will be spent doing homework and working on the design projects, both individually and in groups. Because much of the work for this seminar will be done during class time, attendance is essential. Students missing a class meeting should contact the instructor and their group to make up the work. Students may not miss more than two classes during the semester. This seminar is graded on an A/B/C/D/F basis, furthermore it is a class where your work is impacting the lives of people around the world and we expect an appropriate level of commitment.\n\nactivities\n\npercentages\n\nClass Participation and Attendance\n\n10%\n\nWeekly Progress/Updates\n\n15%\n\nHomework Assignments\n\n10%\n\nM1 Design Review\n\n25%\n\nFinal Design/Prototype\n\n15%\n\nM2 Final Presentation\n\n25%\n\nGroup Meetings and Weekly Updates\n\nRoughly one session each week will be largely dedicated to group work and will include progress reports and group consulting. Groups should come to class with a work plan for the class so they can get things done while they are together as a group. Groups will also need to schedule time for meetings outside of the class session.\n\nIntellectual Property Policy\n\nIn this class, you will be working on projects and inventions as individuals or in groups. All of MIT's intellectual property rules apply to any projects you work on during this class. For further information about these policies, you can contact the IP office directly. The Web site for the office is\nMIT Office of Intellectual Property Counsel\nand some of the policies on \"Ownership of Intellectual Property\" can be seen at\nInformation Policies\n.\n\nThat being (carefully) said, students can own the rights to their projects if they have not made significant use of MIT resources. The machine shop, library, desktop computers and so on are not considered significant MIT resources. It is unlikely that you will receive \"significant MIT resources\" (e.g. certain types and amounts of money) from this class. Unless you have received other resources from MIT outside of this class, it is unlikely that MIT will have any rights to the intellectual property you develop in this class. Please contact the IP office with any questions.",

Email to instructor beforehand.\n\nCome up with a detailed list of things you plan to accomplish during the next 3\nweeks. This should be based on the first items in your Gantt chart. You can\nmake a mini Gantt chart if some things are dependent on other things (i.e.\ndesign, build, assemble), or a list of tasks if they can all be done in parallel (i.e.\npurchase items A-Z).\n\n(Note on Gantt charts, if an item is not dependent on another item, it should be\nlisted early on the Gantt chart. For example, building something from a piece of\nmetal has to come after you purchase the metal, but buying some paint for it can\ncome at the beginning, and does not have to wait until the item is built. Do things\nin parallel whenever possible. This will save time because you will not have to\nspend time waiting for the paint to be delivered when your item is otherwise\nready to go.)\n\nWrite down a clearly what is going to be completed each week (either using the\nGantt chart or due dates on your list.)\n\nThe tasks on the list should be bite sized and there should be many of them (5-\n10 items). If a task is going to take more than a couple of hours, break it up into\nsmaller tasks. The objective is to be able to check off tasks as you go, and see\nwhether you are on schedule. If you have one big task, \"do the project\", you\ncannot measure progress, delegate work if you have teammates, or tell when\nyou have finished. It is also much less intimidating to start a small task than a big\none.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.S06 Prototypes to Products\nFall 2005\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Prototypes to Products, SP.724\n\nHomework #4\n\nAssigned: Thursday 9/20/05\nDue: Parts of this are due each day for the next 3 weeks, please read carefully.\n\nPart 1: Thursday September 22:\n\nLinda Plano will be guest speaking. Answer the following questions. Short answers are\npreferable.\n\nToday it can be difficult to build a career directly related to Appropriate Technology even though\nthere is considerable need for it throughout the world. In this class, we want to explore options to\nachieve ongoing development and dissemination of AT. Many people believe that no one should\nmake a profit from AT, at least not for AT in the developing world. To explore this issue, think\nabout what you would want your life to be like if you were to make a career out of AT.\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, assume that in five to ten years, you will have a spouse and\ntwo kids under the age of five and that you want to continue doing AT. Please answer the\nfollowing questions:\n- Financial Risk Tolerance\n- What's your risk tolerance? I.e., how much of your income would you be willing\nto risk if you were working on something you really care about?\n- What's your risk tolerance for your family*? If you are the sole provider, how\nmuch of their financial well-being are you willing to risk?\n- What's their risk tolerance? Do you think they would agree with you (OK, that's a\ntough one but I promise you'll need to deal with it one way or another if you get\nmarried)?\n- Lifestyle\n- What counts as a luxury? I.e., how much income do you need to have in order\nto have the lifestyle you want?\n- What counts as barely acceptable?\n- Values, Impact and Control\n- What are your values - personal, local, global? This is a huge question,\nobviously, but one that bears thinking about for your future. For the purposes of\nthis class, try to think about it in terms of AT: e.g., is it important to you that you\nget to work on AT because you enjoy it?; is it important that your community\nbenefits from and/or recognizes your efforts on your AT work?; is it important that\nyour work have a global impact? Or just that it is benign?\n\n- How critical is it that your work expresses those values?\n- Does it matter to you whether you are calling the shots? I.e., do you want\nsomeone else figuring out the overall strategy as long as you get to do hands-on\nwork, or vice versa?\nNote: There are definitely no right or wrong answers to this and related values questions. The\nmore honest you are, the better the chances that you will avoid a midlife crisis. Honest!\nPart 2: Tuesday, September 27 & Tuesday, October 4\nBen Linder will be consulting on your project. Bring in your Gantt chart, and your list of tasks. He\nwill be able to spend around 15 minutes on each project, so be ready to explain what you have\nbeen working on, and how it has been going. Be ready to ask questions if you are getting stuck\non anything. Use the feedback you get to adjust your tasks for next week.\nPart 3: Thursday October 6th\nJoost Bonson will be guest speaking. Come prepared with any questions about networking,\nbusiness questions, 50k competition, the Developmental Entrepreneurship class, etc.\nPart 4: Thursday, October 13th,\nProgress reports: Have a couple of power point slides discussing what you have done for the past\nfew weeks, and if your goals originally were different, why was there a difference? What your\nmajor goals are for the next 2 weeks?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.S06 Prototypes to Products\nFall 2005\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Strengths and Weaknesses refer to issues internal to\nthe team; Opportunities and Threats refer to issues external to the team.\n\nWhat are the Strengths within the team?\n\nWhat do we do well?\n\nWhat do we know or have already that can help us?\n\nWhat did the judges like about our project?\n\nWhat are the Weaknesses within the team?\n\nWhat do we do poorly, or don't know how to do?\n\nWhat concerns did the judges raise?\n\nWhat other internal limits do we face?\n\nWhat are the external Opportunities we have?\nWhat aspects of the situation that we're trying to help will make this a success?\n\nWho do we know who can help us make this a reality?\n\nWhat are the external Threats we face?\nWhat features of the community we're trying to help might hinder our work?\nAre there logistical issues beyond our control?\n\nNow, look at the overlaps between the internal strengths and weaknesses and the\nexternal threats and opportunities to help you decide on priorities.\n\nOpportunities\nThreats\nStrengths\nInvest: there's great overlap and\nthese areas you should definitely\npursue\nDefend: you can probably\nmobilize your resources to\nminimize these threats\nWeaknesses\nDecide: you have a choice, either\ninvest resources to prevent the\nweakness from ruining the\nopportunity, let the opportunity go,\nor collaborate to mitigate the\nweakness\nDamage Control/Divest: this is a\nrisky area that you need to\nmanage\n\nReview this SWOT analysis, thinking about your objectives and whether you need to\nrevise them based on this analysis. Overall, the SWOT is intended to make sure you're\nthinking about the project you're undertaking, to maximize your chances for success.\n\nSample SWOT Analysis for Sample Project\n\nStrengths\n1. Completed Proof of Concept (POC)\n2. Good sales case: low cost, fast, easy to use\n3. Patent just issued\n\nWeaknesses\n4. POC needs advanced features\n5. Low on $$\n6. Alan is too busy\n7. I don't like sales\n8. Need to partner with company with manufacturing capabilities\n\nOpportunities\n9. We have existing contacts\n10. Product area is hot right now\n\nThreats\n11. Finding a partner is proving difficult\n12. The competition may make something better soon\n13. POC is perceived as not capable enough\n\nOpportunities\nThreats\nStrengths\nInvest:\n1,2,3,10\nGood market and good\nposition\nDefend:\n\n2,3,11 - Use sales attributes\nand patent to attract partner\n\n1&12 - Get product out\nbefore field moves ahead\ntoo far\n\n2&13 Show value\nWeaknesses\n\nDecide:\n\n5, 7,8&9 Get existing contacts\nto help\n\n5 & 10 - Sell something with\nreduced features sooner\nDamage control:\n\n8&11 Get a partner \"or\nelse...\"\n\n3,12 &13 Get product started\nso we can concentrate on\nnew features\n\nSummary: Bold items indicate areas to focus on. Some basic ideas came up in\nmore than one box, so they are the most important, and create a coherent\nstrategy.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.S06 Prototypes to Products\nFall 2005\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
