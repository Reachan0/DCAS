  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nSummary\n\nTechnology Roadmapping (TRM for short) is a 9 unit Fall Semester 2002 Masters Research Seminar on exploring long-term industry dynamics of emerging technologies. Students perform original work crafting or enhancing a Roadmap in a technology-business domain of their choice. Thesis & Special Project opportunities are offered & encouraged.\n\nSeminar Description\n\nThis seminar will explore the purposes and development of Technology Roadmaps for systematically mapping out possible development paths for various technological domains and the industries that build on them.\n\nData of importance for such Roadmaps include rates of innovation, key bottlenecks, physical limitations, improvement trendlines, corporate intent, and value-chain and industry evolutionary paths.\n\nThe course will build on ongoing work on the MIT Communications Technology Roadmap project, and begin exploring other domains as well. Towards this end, we will have faculty guest speakers - mostly lab directors drawn from a spectrum of research centers at MIT - each of whom will share their long-term perspective on their fields and what they perceive to be open and compelling directions for future effort.\n\nCaveat\n\nIt's crucial that all participating students realize this is a\nResearch\nSeminar, meaning that all participants must perform original (and hard) work. You should be doing this because you think this sort of in-depth research is highly aligned with your professional interests and aspirations. For example, research you will perform for this Seminar will be an excellent entree to CTOs, key people in companies in your industry of choice, and so forth. We, in turn, will be offering sometimes half-baked & even preliminary ideas, sharing lessons-learned along the way, figuring things out as we go, and generally investing a lot of time and braincycles into really understanding what Technology Roadmapping could and should be.\n\nSeminar Goals\n\nWe hope to foster collaborative efforts between 1-3 students, MIT researchers, & Industry Sponsors, cutting across MIT research areas. Furthermore, we hope this includes Cross Industry Benchmarking, ideally in partnership with Industrial Sponsors of current and potential research at MIT. We'd like to develop an \"MIT Method\" of Roadmapping which integrates Technology AND Business Dynamics. Ideally, we attract students passionate about the technology sector - however broadly or narrowly defined - who are committed to producing a coherent & complete Tech Roadmap (Draft 1.0) during the Fall Semester.\n\nOur overall TRM aspiration is to build up a rich and thriving MIT Technology Roadmapping Initiative, one which integrates many currently disparate or fragmented research veins.\n\nElements of the MIT Technology Roadmapping Initiative\n\nBusiness Cycle Dynamics\n- e.g. systems dynamics-like models of the bullwhip effect\n\nIndustry Structure Dynamics\n- e.g. the double helix in\nClockspeed\n\nCorporate Strategy Dynamics\n- e.g. S-curves & dynamic analyses of players in the value chain\n\nTechnology Dynamics\n- e.g. the Semiconductor Industry Association's roadmap built around Moore's law\n\nRegulatory Policy Dynamics\n- e.g. Cross-National, Cross-Sector\n\nPurpose of Roadmapping\n\nTech Roadmapping allows for a technology-and-Industry-level of observation & analysis. Ideally the effort encourages Broad faculty participation, drawn from Multi-Disciplinary parts of the Institute, so as to cover the Emerging Technology spectrum and assessment of Business Implications of Technology trends. If done well, this offers a unifying, big-picture perspective, and a long-term \"futurecasting\" view. Furthermore, we are neutral-ground for discussion among industry players & MIT research sponsors.\n\nPossible Benefits of TRM\n\nWe closely observe Value Chain Evolution over time\n\nLanguage for discussion between business & technology world\n\nStructured basis for interaction Cross Value Chains, between academia & industry, spanning basic research through application\n\nBridging between vertical \"silos\" of research - e.g. MicroPhotonics / LIDS / Media Lab / eBiz Center\n\nPublishing Collaborative Tech Roadmaps\n\nRisk goes down, Capital Investment goes up (generally)\n\nTechnology Roadmapping Essentials\n\nPerformance indicators\n\nInnovations over time, trendlines\n\nPhysical limitations\n\nValue Chains\n\nIndustry Structure\n\nExamples of Degrees of Technology Aggregation\n\nCommunications Roadmap\n\nOptical Communications\n\nMicroPhotonics\n\nWireless\n\nPersonal Area Networking\n\nCellular G3, G4, G5\n\nMedical Imaging\n\nMRI\n\nFunctional MRI\n\nNanotechnology\n\nPrecision Engineering\n\nAFM\n\nBiological Engineering\n\nBacterial Robotic\n\nEnrollment & Expectations\n\nOpen to truly dedicated students who commit to active attendance, the readings, the necessary independent research, & crafting a high-quality Technology Roadmap in your technology domain of choice.\n\nGrading\n\nStudents are graded 20% based on class participation & attendance, 15% on progress report presentations & documentation, 45% on the quality & content of the final TRM presentation & documentation, 5% for adding novel reference material to our library of links and TRM documentation, and 15% discretionary for demonstrably helping classmates improve their roadmapping abilities, sharing lessons-learned, and generally going \"above & beyond.\"\n\nTeamwork\n\nWe allow students to work either alone or in teams of 2 or 3 consisting of people of their own choice. For grading purposes, teamwork will be judged per-capita, with special effort made to assess individual contribution within the team. We will not tolerate free-riders in this seminar; everyone must be a full contributor.",

Data of importance for such roadmaps\ninclude rates of innovation, key bottlenecks, physical limitations,\nimprovement trendlines, corporate intent, and value chain and industry\nevolutionary paths. The course will build on ongoing work on the\nMIT Communications Technology Roadmap project, but will explore other\ndomains selected from Nanotechnology, Bio-informatics,\nGeno/Proteino/Celleomics, Neurotechnology, Imaging & Diagnostics,\netc. Thesis and Special Project opportunities will be offered.\n(A Sloan Research Seminar)\n\nTRM Class Goals\n- Collaborative efforts among 1-3 students, MIT\nresearchers, & Industry Sponsors\n- Across MIT research areas\n- Cross Industry Benchmarking\n- Partnered with Industrial Sponsors\n- Covering Technology AND Business Dynamics\n- Attract students passionate about technology\nsector, however broadly or narrowly defined\n- Committed to producing coherent & complete\nTech Roadmap (Draft 1.0) during Fall Semester\n\nHigh TRM Student Expectations\n- Serious commitment of time & interest\n- Literature review & substantial interviews\n- Attend talks & seminar series in that tech\nsector, that's part of the course\n- E.g. http://web.mit.edu/mphotonics/www/sem-\nseries.shtml\n- Data gathering & presentation smithing\n- Crafting a draft PPT & DOC by semesters\nend\n\nEngaging Masters Students in\nMIT Sloan Research Agendae\n- Business school disconnect\n- Unfortunate and sub-optimal\n- We're prototyping a new path\n- Help show that it works!\n\nStone Soup analogy\nno free riders\nClockspeed as touchstone\nvalue chain dynamics\nRoadmap as a verb:\nto do collaborative planning\n\nSeriously\n- If you're not really serious, free up a slot\n- We want this to be a top priority\n- The seminar ought to BOTH advance\nyour professional interests AND appeal\nto our shared roadmapping vision\n\nSeminars & Conferences\n- Part of your 9 units is required\nattendance of relevant technology\nseminars throughout MIT.\n- Find them through http://web.mit.edu\nGoogle & so forth.
