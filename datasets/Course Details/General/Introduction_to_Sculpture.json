  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 3 hours / session\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis class introduces fundamental issues in sculpture such as site, context, process, psychology and aesthetics of the object, and the object's relation to the body. During the semester Introduction to Sculpture will explore issues of interpretation and audience interaction. As a significant component to this class introductions to a variety of materials and techniques both traditional (wood, metal, plaster) as well as non-traditional (fabric, latex, found objects, rubber, etc.) will be emphasized.\n\nThroughout the semester both individually, and as a class, through work produced and discussions generated from it, the meaning of such terms as '\nsculpture\n' '\ndwelling\n' '\nprocess\n' '\nutility\n' '\npublic space\n' '\nmaterial\n' '\nprivate space\n' '\nstructure\n' '\nnomadic\n' '\npermanent\n' and other will be re-defined.\n\nWhereas this is a studio-oriented class with a strong physical basis, this class will be examining these issues via readings, artist lectures, slides, videos, a field trip and other material.\n\nRequirements\n\nA minimum of six hours per week outside class work is expected.\n\nThree major projects will be given during the course of the semester along with smaller projects interspersed throughout. Completion of all projects is required for a passing grade, as is regular attendance.\n\nThe course will utilize readings periodically to focus and generate discussion as well as to inspire. Participation/preparation in these discussions is mandatory.\n\nSketchbook_:_ A book (blank, unlined, is ideal) for this class is a requirement. To be used both for artistic ideas as well as retaining technical information. When individual meetings occur it is important to have this available.\n\nTape measure.\n\nAttendance on the fieldtrip to Dia Beacon / New York City.\n\nEvaluations\n\nAssessment and critique of your studio projects will take place in three ways:\n\nMeetings individually with professors and TA while work is being executed.\n\nA mid-point critique where work will be 75% completed and will undergo rigorous assessment from professors, teaching assistants, fellow peers, and invited artists.\n\nA final critique where comments from the first two assessments will figure into a more complete/cohesive final project.\n\nGrading will be based on:\n\nACTIVITY\n\nPERCENTAGE\n\nConcept of individual projects\n\n20%\n\nExecution of individual projects\n\n20%\n\nClass participation\n\n20%\n\nPersonal investment in and commitment to your work\n\n20%\n\nDemonstrated growth over the course of the semester\n\n20%\n\nCompletion of all projects is required for a passing grade, as is regular attendance and constructive participation.\n\nSafety\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned come to class prepared to work.\n\nWith a myriad of different production techniques there are equally numerous ways of doing unintentional injury to yourself and others around you. The following should always be followed:\n\nWear work clothes.\n\nHave closed toed shoes.\n\nNo loose hair.\n\nNo loose jewelry.\n\nWear gloves when appropriate.\n\nWear eye protection when appropriate.\n\nClean up after yourself.\n\nLift heavy objects carefully and with assistance.\n\nIf you're not sure about a procedure or equipment ask someone. (Course Instructor, TA, Woodshop Monitor)\n\nLab Fee\n\nThe lab fee of $40 covers photocopies, and some basic material, but does not cover general materials for projects. Some material is available from the sculpture area, some for purchase, some for salvage (ask first). Others will need to be purchased directly from outside sources (list of suppliers and contacts as needed).",

Pliant material such as fabric /\nrubber / will be inserted / integrated / juxtaposed against such hard material such\nas steel, wood, masonry material etc. This sculpture must engage some type of\nphysical /psychological /emotional territory. It may need to center around some\naspect of your personal desires / fears / and experiences.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nThere is no size limitation on this project.\n\nMust incorporate metalworking techniques.\n\nSculpture may be freestanding sculpture or rely on existing architecture or be\nplaced in situ.\n\nPresentation of your work influences its reception.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS:\n\nWhat is a structure and what is skin?\n\nHow is structure and skin related to hard and soft?\n\nDoes a skin act to hold a structure together or is a skin draped over (tarp-like) a\npreexisting structure?\n\nWhat type of material are structures and skins made of?\n\nWhat material biases do hard materials and soft materials have? feminine vs.\nmasculine?\n\nConsider the transformative nature of some materials (yarn that turns into a more\nstable woven cloth)\n\nTECHNICAL INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDE:\n\nmetal working (welding, cutting, joining, etc)\npliable material construction\nsurface manipulations\n\nCALENDAR:\n\nWednesday,\nSeptember 3\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMonday,\nSeptember 8\nMetal Demo / Definitions\nWednesday,\nSeptember 10\nMIG / introduce Project 1, Structures and Skins / slides / quick assy.\n\nMonday,\nSeptember 15\nSewing demo/ quick assy.\nWednesday,\nSeptember 17\nPlan of action /Reading\n\nMonday,\nSeptember 22\nStudent Holiday NO CLASS\nWednesday,\nSeptember 24\nVisiting artist, Hiro Mori / how to connect things demo\n\nMonday,\nSeptember 29\nslides / production\nWednesday,\nOctober 1\nin-progress review\n\nMonday,\nOctober 6\nProduction\nWednesday,\nOctober 8\nProduction\n\nMonday,\nOctober 13\nColumbus Day NO CLASS\nWednesday,\nOctober 15\nReview, Project 1 (guest critique)"
