What differentiates the elastic and plastic theory of structures is the constitutive behavior.\nThe other two groups of equations ie, the equations of equilibrium, Eq.(252 and 253 of Part I), and the strain-\ndisplacement relations remain the same. This chapter focuses on the development of constitutive equations for plates\nand shells. Three new concepts will be introduced:\n- Plastic incompressibility\nYield conditions\n-\nAssociated flow rule\n-\nEach of the above concepts will be briefly described.\n1.1\nPlastic Incompressibility\nThe explanation of this concept requires going back to the equation of the 3-D elasticity. Recall the relationship\nbetween the volumetric strain εii and the hydrostatic pressure.\nεii =\np\n(1)\nK\nwhere p = 1\n3 σii is the mean stress and K is the bulk modulus defined by\nE\nK =\n(2)\n3(1 - 2ν)\nThe physical meaning of εii is the relative change of volume\ndV\nεii = ε11 + ε22 + ε33 =\n(3)\nV\nThere is an overwhelming experimental evidence that plastic deformations do not produce any volume change of the\nmaterial, dV = 0 even though the hydrostatic pressure is very high. This means that εii = 0. Strictly speaking the\nplastic part of the strain tensor will vanish, εp = 0. In view of Eq.(1) the bulk modulus should go to infinity, which\nii\nhappens when ν = 0.5. Thus for a plastic incompressible material the Poisson ratio should be equal to one half. In\nthe theory of plates and shells the material incompressibility is equivalent to\nεαα = -ε33\n(4)\nTherefore, a joint action of any in-plane direct strains produces strain in the thickness direction ε33. There are no\nconstraints for the thickness h to become thinner or thicker. The incompressibility condition will thus be automati\ncally satisfied for thin-walled structures. The only inconsistency is that in the constitutive equations for plates and\nshells, the thickness is considered to be constant while in reality there will be a small change, according to Eq.(4).\n1.2\nYield Condition\nThe starting point of the analysis is the Hooke's law for plane stress\nE\nσαβ = 1 - ν2 [(1 - ν)εαβ + νγγ δαβ ]\n(5)\nintroduced earlier, see Eq.(34 of Part I). The inverted form of the above equation is\nν\n= 1 - ν\n(6)\nεαβ\nE\nσαβ - 1 + ν σγγ δαβ\n\nHuber postulated in 1904 that yielding of the material occurs when the elastic (distortional) energy in a unit\nvolume reaches a critical value. The strain energy density is defined\n1 σαβ · εαβ = C\n(7)\nUsing Eq.(6) and the incompressibility ν = 2\n1 , the strain energy can be expressed in terms of the plane stress tensor\nas\n1 + ν\n2E\nσαβ σαβ - 3 σαασββ = C\nor\n(8)\n2EC\n3σαβ σαβ - σαασββ = 1 + ν = C1\n(9)\nThe unknown calibration constant C1 can be determined from uniaxial tension or shear test. Consider uniaxial\ntension\nσαβ =\nσ11\n(10)\nExpanding the expression on the left hand side of Eq.(9), one gets\n3σ2\n11 = 2σ2 = C1\n(11)\n11 - σ2\nYielding occurs when σ11 = σy , where σy is the uniaxial yield stress of the material. Thus C1 = 2σy\n2 and the\nfinal form of the plane stress yield condition reads\n3σαβ σαβ - σαασββ = 2σ2\n(12)\ny\nIn the expanded notation, Eq.(12) takes the following form\nσ2\n+ 3σ2 = σ2\n(13)\n11 - σ11σ22 + σ22\ny\nIn the principal stress coordinate system σ12 = 0, and Eq.(13) reduces to\nσ1\n2 - σ1σ2 + σ2 = σ2\n(14)\ny\nA graphical representation of Eq.(14) is the Huber-Mises ellipse (full line). The broken line in the same figure\n\nr\np\n\nrepresents the Tresca yield condition which is derived from an entire different hypothesis. Tresca assumed that\nyielding of the material occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches a critical value. The maximum shear stress\ncan be easily expressed in terms of principal stresses\nτmax = max |σ1 -\nσ2| , |σ2 -\nσ3| , |σ3 -\nσ1|\n(15)\nIn the case of plane stress σ3 = 0 and Eq.(15) reduce to\nmax {|σ1 - σ2| , |σ2| , |σ1|} = 2k = σy\n(16)\nwhere k is the yield stress in shear. A graphical representation of Eq.(16) is the Tresca Hexagon.\n1.3\nAssociated Flow Rule\nLet us define the yield function F by\nF ≡ 3σαβ σαβ - σαασββ - 2σy\n(17)\nIt was observed experimentally that increments or rates of the plastic strain tensor ε αβ are normal to the yield\ncondition\nMathematically, the normality condition is expressed as\nε αβ = λ δF (σαβ )\nδσαβ\n(18)\nPerforming the differentiation one finally gets the flow rule for plane stress.\nε αβ = 2 λ(3σαβ - σααδαβ )\n(19)\nwhere λ is the proportionality constant.\nIt is possible to invert the flow rule with the help of the yield condition. The proportionality constant can be\neliminated between Eq.(12) and (19) and the stresses can be uniquely expressed in terms of components of the strain\nrates by\n2 σy\nε αβ + εααδαβ\n(20)\nσαβ =\nε αβ ε αβ + εααε ββ\nIn the principal coordinate system\nσ1,\nε1,\n(21)\nσαβ =\n, εαβ =\n0,\n0,\nσ2\nε2\n\np\np\nr\np\nand Eq.(20) reduces to\nσy\n2 ε1 +\n= √\n⎫\n⎪\n\n⎬\nε2\nσ1\nε 2\n1 + ε1ε 2 + ε2\n(22)\n⎪\n⎭\n2 ε2 + ε1\nσ2\nσy\n= √\nε 2\n1 + ε1ε 2 + ε2\nFinally, from Eq.(20) one can easily calculate the so-called plastic dissipation rate D .\nD = σαβ ε αβ =\n2 σy\nε αβ ε αβ + εααε ββ\n(23)\nIn particular, the state ε22 = ε12 = 0 corresponds to the transverse plane strain in which the dissipation rate reduces\nto\nD = ( √2\n3 σy) ε11\n(24)\nThis state is represented in the figure by point A where the stress coordinates are\nσ1 = √2\n3 σy\n(25)\nσ2 = √1\n3 σy\nThus under the constraint ε2 = 0, there is a reaction stress σ2 = 2\n1 σ1\nYield Conditions in the Space of Generalized Stresses\nIn the theory of the elastic structures the relationship between the generalized stresses and strain is obtained relatively\neasily. The Hooke's law is linear. Thus, integration of stresses through the thickness is straightforward where the\nLove-Kirchoff hypothesis is used. By contrast, in the case of plastic structures, the stress-strain rate relation are\nnonlinear and with the exception of few simple cases, the integration can not be performed.\nSimple and surprisingly accurate results are obtained by replacing the solid cross-section by a sandwich section.\nThe face plates of the thickness t each transmit in-plane stresses σαβ . The sandwich core of the thickness h transmits\nin-plane shear stresses.\n\nIt is assumed that h >> t so that the distribution of stresses σαβ over the thickness of the face plate is constant.\nThe one-dimensional case of stress distribution is shown in the figure below.\nThus, the stress resultant Nαβ and stress couples Mαβ are\nNαβ = (σ+ + σ-)t\n(26)\nαβ\nαβ\nh\nMαβ = (σ-\nαβ )t\n(27)\nαβ - σ+\nConsider a uniaxial case. If both the face plates are at yield σ+ = σ-= σy. then from Eq.(26) the reference\nmembrane force is\nN0 = 2σyt\n(28)\nwhile M = 0. In the case of pure bending σ-= σy , σ+\nand the reference bending moment is\n11 = -σy\nM0 = σyth\n(29)\nwhile the membrane force is zero. It is convenient to normalize the components of the membrane force and bending\nmoment according to\nnαβ = Nαβ ,\nmαβ = Mαβ\n(30)\nN0\nM0\n\nr\nThen, the system of Eqs.(26) and (27) is equivalent to\nσ+ = σy(nαβ - mαβ ),\nαβ\n(31)\nσ-= σy(nαβ + mαβ )\nαβ\nAssuming that both upper and lower face plates of the sandwich structures are at yield, Eq.(31) can be inserted to\nthe plane stress yield conditions given by Eq.(12). This leads to the following simultaneous system of equations\n3nαβ nαβ - nααnββ + 3mαβ mαβ - mααmββ = 2\n(32)\n3mαβ nαβ - mααnββ = 0\n(33)\nIn particular, in the principal coordinate system Eqs.(32) and (33) reduce to\nn1\n2 - n1n2 + n2\n2 + m1\n2 - m1m2 + m2\n2 = 1\n(34)\n2n1m1 + 2n2m2 - n1m2 - n2m1 = 0\n(35)\nEqs.(32) and (35) can be represented as a surface F (mαβ , nαβ ) = 0 in the six-dimensional space. Many special cases\ncan be derived from Eqs.(32) and (33).\n2.1\nPure Bending Action, Nαβ = 0 or nαβ = 0\nEquation(33) is identically satisfied and Eq.(32) yields\n3mαβ mαβ - mααmββ = 2\n(36)\nor in physical quantities (see the normalization Eqs.(29) and (30))\n3Mαβ Mαβ - MααMββ = 2M 2\n(37)\nIn principal direction\nM1\n2 - M1M2 + M 2 = M 2\n(38)\nIt is interesting to note that Eq.(36) is exact, i.e. the same expression is obtained for solid and sandwich\nsections. Therefore, the six-dimensional yield surface given by Eqs.(32) and (33) is sufficiently accurate for practical\napplications. Note a formal analogy between the yield condition in plane stress, Eq.(17) and corresponding yield\nloci for moments, Eq.(36). Therefore, the expression for the flow rule and dissipation function can be readily written\nwithout derivation.\nr\nMαβ =\n2 M0 p κ αβ + κγγ δαβ\n(39)\nκ αβ κ αβ + καακ ββ\nD b = Mαβ κ αβ =\n2 M0\np\nκ αβ κ αβ + καακ ββ\n(40)\n2.2\nPure Membrane Action, Mαβ = 0 or mαβ = 0\nEq.(33) is identically satisfied while Eq.(32) reduces to:\n3nαβ nαβ - nααnββ = 2\n(41)\nIn physical quantities the above equation reads\n3Nαβ Nαβ - NααNββ = 2N 2\n(42)\nIn principal directions\nN1\n2 - N1N2 + N 2 = N 2\n(43)\n\nq\nq\nBoth yield loci are represented by a Huber-Mises ellipse.\nr\nNαβ =\n3 N0\nε αβ + εγγ δαβ\np ε αβ ε αβ + εααε ββ\n(44)\nr\nDm = Nαβ ε αβ =\n3 N0\np\nε αβ ε αβ + εααε ββ\n(45)\n2.3\nCylindrical Shell\nIn a more general case in which both bending moments and membrane forces are developed, the four dimensional\nyield function F(mαβ ,nαβ ) can be defined by combining Eqs.(32) and (33). Then, the associated flow rule will define\nthe direction of the generalized strain rates.\nκ αβ = λ\nδF , ε αβ = λ δF\n(46)\nδmαβ\nδnαβ\nFor example, for a cylindrical shell with zero axial membrane force n1\nn 2\n2 + 3\n4 m 2\n= 1,\nm2 = m1\n(47)\nCombining Eqs.(46) and (47), the inverted constitutive equations are\n4κ 2\nε 2\n(48)\nn2 =\n,\nm1 =\n\n4κ\nε 2\nε\nκ\n+\n+ 3\nThe elliptical yield locus given by Eq.(47) is compared with the yield conditions corresponding to the Tresca and\nmaximum stress yield criterion.\nPrinciple of Virtual Velocity and Limit Analysis\nIn the theory of plasticity the incremental and rate formulations are equivalent. From the chain rule of differentiation\nδεαβ = δεαβ δt = ε αβ δt\n(49)\nδt\nThe constitutive equation of plasticity, Eq.(20) is the homogenous equation of degree zero i.e.\nσαβ ( εαβ ) = σαβ ( δεαβ ) = σαβ (δεαβ )\n(50)\nδt\n\nZ\nZ\nI\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nThis property proves the equivalence of the global equilibrium equation expressed by δπ = 0, Eq.(118 of Part I) and\nthe principle of virtual velocity\n(M αβ κ αβ + Nαβ ε αβ )dS =\nwdS +\n\n+ Nnt\n(51)\np\n(Nnnun\nut)\nS\nS\nΓ\nwhere (n, t) denotes the normal and tangential direction on the outer boundary Γ. It should be mentioned that\nEq.(51) represents the condition of global equilibrium from which the local equilibrium equation can be derived.\nThis has been done in Part I notes on the example of small (Eq. 101) and moderately large deflections of plates (Eq.\n136). In the case of the bending theory of plates subjected to a transverse pressure loading, Eq.(51) reduces to\nMαβ κ αβ dS =\np\n(52)\nwdS,\nS\nS\nwhere S is the lateral surface of the shell. Note that for the principle of virtual velocity the static quantities (Mαβ , p)\nmust be in equilibrium. Similarly, the rate of generalized strains καβ must be compatible with the displacement rate,\nw . In Eq.(52) nothing is said about the relation between Mαβ and καβ , so it is valid for any type of material.\n3.1\nLower Bound Theorem\nThe limit analysis theorem for elastic-perfectly plastic structures provides bounds on the magnitude of external loads\ncausing structural collapse. In this connection, two new concepts are introduced.\nAny stress state M *\nαβ , p* satisfying:\n- Equation of equilibrium (Eq. 101 of Part I)\n- Stress (moments) boundary conditions (Eq. 102 of Part I)\n- And not violating the yield condition, F ≤ 0\nis called the statically admissible state. It can be proved that p* provides a lower bound for the exact limit load,\np* ≤ p. Example will follow.\n3.2\nUpper Bound Theorem\nThe main new concept is the kinematically admissible velocity field w ∗. This field represents the incipient collapse\nmode of a structure. It has to satisfy the kinematic boundary conditions (zero velocity or slopes) and should lead to\nunique expressions for the generalized strain rates κ∗\nfrom which the rate of plastic dissipation can be calculated,\nαβ\nusing Eq.(40). The corresponding collapse load p∗ is defined by\nM ∗ κ ∗\np∗w ∗dS\n(53)\nαβ αβ dS ≡\nS\nS\nIt should be noted that ( κ∗\nw∗) is a kinematically admissible state. At the same time, (M ∗\nαβ ,\nαβ , p∗) are generally not\nin equilibrium.\nIn order to prove the upper bound theorem consider a modified version of the principle of virtual work, Eq.(52):\nMαβ κ αβ\n∗ dS =\npw ∗dS\n(54)\nS\nS\nEquation (54) differs from Eq. (53) in that the starred quantities are replaced by exact values (Mαβ , p) which are in\nequilibrium.\nSubtracting side by side Eq.(54) from Eq.(53) one gets\n(M ∗\nκ∗\n(p∗ - p) w∗dS\n(55)\nαβ - Mαβ ) αβ dS =\nS\nS\nAccording to Drucker's stability postulate the integrand (Mαβ\n∗ - Mαβ ) κ∗\n≥ 0 is non-negative for the convex\nαβ\nR\nyield condition and the associated flow rule. It follows then from Eq. (55) that p∗ ≥ p provided that\nw ∗dS > 0.\nS\nWe have shown that the load intensity p∗, defined by Eq. (53), is always an upper bound on the actual collapse load\np.\n\nApplications\n4.1\nBending of a Simply Supported Plate\nLet us consider a simply supported circular plate subjected to the uniformly distributed transverse pressure p.\nThe internal stress state is defined by the radial and circumferential bending moments (Mr, Mθ). In view of the\nrotational symmetry the twisting moment vanishes. Therefore, the bending moments are principal bending moments\nMr = M1, Mθ = M2 and the yield condition Eq.(38) applies. The lower bound on the collapse load is calculated\nfirst.\nLet us consider the hexagon inscribed into the von Mises ellipse. Boundary conditions\nMr = Mθ\nat\nr = 0\n(56)\nMr = 0\nat r = R\ndictate that the stress profile lies in the first quadrant, so that\n0 < Mr\n*< M0\n(57)\nMθ = M0\nThe problem has been reduced to finding a distribution of the radial bending moment Mr\n*(r) satisfying the stress\nboundary condition and the equations of equilibrium. The equations of equilibrium of the circular plate, transferred\nfrom the rectangular coordinate system (Eq. 101 of Part I) to the polar coordinate system are\nForce equilibrium\nd (rQr) + rp = 0\n(58)\ndr\nMoment equilibrium\nd (rMr) - Mθ - rQr = 0\n(59)\ndr\nwhere Qr is the transverse shear force. Substituting Mθ = 0 and eliminating Qr between the above equations yields\nd2\n(rMr) = -pr\n(60)\ndr2\nThe solution of this equation satisfying the static (moment) boundary conditions, Eq.(56), is\nMr(r) = p\n6(R2 - r 2)\n(61)\nIn particular, for r = 0, Mr = Mθ = M0 so that\np* = 6\nR\nM\n(62)\nThis expression provides a lower bound on the collapse load of the plate obeying the von Mises yield condition. Note\nthat in deriving the above lower bound, nothing was said about the curvature rates ( κr, κ θ) or the strain rate field\nw .\n\nIn order to derive an upper bound on the collapse load, one has to define the kinematic boundary conditions. For\na simply supported plate the slope at the center should vanish and the velocity at the outer boundary is zero:\ndw = 0 at r = 0\n(63)\ndr\nw = 0 at r = R\n(64)\nA specific form of Eq.(56) for a circular plate from which the upper bound load is calculated reads\nZ R 2\nq\nZ R\n2π\nM0\n( κ∗r )2 + κ∗r κ ∗\nθ + ( κ∗\nθ)2rdr = 2π\np∗w ∗(r)rdr\n(65)\n√\nThe left hand side represents the rate of plastic energy dissipation in the bending action integrated over the plate\narea, according to Eq.(40). The right hand side is the rate of work of external loading. The principal curvature are\nthe radial and circumferential curvatures, defined by:\nκr = - d2w\ndr2 ,\nκθ = -1\nr\nd w\ndr\n(66)\nLet us assume a family of kinematically admissible velocity fields in the form\nw∗(r) = w0[1 - ( r\nR )n]\n(67)\nwhere w0 is the central amplitude and n is a free parameter, to be determined. The above solutions satisfy identically\nthe kinematic boundary conditions. Calculating the curvature rates, substituting to Eq.(65) and integrating gives\nthe following expression for the load-carrying capacity:\nM0 4\n2 p\np∗ = R2 √\n3(1 + n ) n2 - n + 1\n(68)\nThe exponent n can now be chosen to minimize the magnitude of p∗. From the condition dp∗ = 0, one obtains the\ndn\ncubic algebraic equation\n2n 3 - n 2 + 2n - 4 = 0\n(69)\nwhose real solution is n = 1.15. Substituting the optimum value of n into Eq.(61) the minimum value of the collapse\nload is\nM0\np∗ = 6.85 R2\n(70)\nThe coefficient in the exact solution of this problem is 6.51 giving the error of some 14%. The reason for the error is\nthat the present approximate solution does not satisfy the \"static\" boundary conditions, given by Eq. (56), and the\nlocal equation of equilibrium. Instead, the components of the bending moment are constant over the plate because\nthe curvature rate ratio is fixed\nκ θ\nα =\n=\n(71)\nκ r\nn - 1\n\nFor n = 1, the vector of the curvature rate is normal to the Mr axis and the coordinates of the moment vector are\n√\n(72)\nM0 = 0.57M0\nMr =\nM0 = 1.15M0\nMθ = √\nIn the present case with n = 1.15 the magnitude of the bending moments are slightly different but constant, see\npoint A in the figure above.\nMr = 0.69M0\n(73)\nMθ = 1.14M0\nIt is seen that the constant moment solution can satisfy neither plate equilibrium, Eq.(59), nor the stress boundary\nconditions. An important conclusion is that bounds in the collapse load 6 < p∗ < 6.85 were established through\nrelatively simple calculations.\n4.2\nConcept of a Plastic Hinge, and Example of a Clamped Plate\nIn order to extend the solution for the simply supported plate to the case of a clamped plate, a concept of the plastic\nhinge line should be introduced.\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\nh\ni\n\ni\nClamped boundary conditions for an elastic plate require vanishing of the slope. Not so in the theory of plasticity.\nConsider the transverse plane strain loading (cylindrical bending) of a strip made of rigid-plastic material.\nCalculate the rate of plastic work over a small segment Δx\nxb\nxb\nMdθ\n(74)\nD =\nM κdx =\nxa\nxa\nwhere κdx = dθ comes from the definition of a curvature as a change of the slope θ,\ndθ\nκ =\n(75)\ndx\nFor Δx = xb - xa sufficiently small, the moment can be assumed to be constant and Eq.(65) is replaced by\nD = M0\nxb\nxa\ndθ = M0θ\nxb = M0\nxa\nθ (xb) - θ (xa) = M0Δθ\n(76)\nwhere Δθ is the relative rotation on both sides of the hinge.\nIn plastic plates and shells discontinuities in the rate of rotation Δθ are admissible and should be included in\nthe formulation. Referring to the case of the clamped plate, there will be a plastic hinge line (a circle). Additional\ninternal work is dissipated on this line.\n(77)\nr=R\nD hinge = 2πR √2\n3 M0θ = 2πR √2\n3 M0\ndw\ndr\nThis new term should be added to the right hand side of the rate of work balance expressed by Eq.(65). Assuming\nthe same velocity field as in the case of the simply supported plate, the contribution of the new term can be easily\nevaluated and the expression for the collapse load becomes,\nM0 4\n2 hp\nR2 √\n3(1 + n )\nn2 - n + 1 + n\np∗ =\n(78)\n\nr\nr\nThe plot of the dimensionless collapse pressure versus the parameter n is shown on page 12. The minimum is seen\nto occur at n = 0.91. The corresponding value of the upper bound on the collapse load is p∗ = 13.8 which is almost\ntwice a similar value for the simply supported plate.\nIt is interesting to compare the velocity profile for both types of boundary conditions, see below. In both cases the\nvelocity field is close to a conical shape but there is a qualitative difference. The curvature of the simply supported\nplate is positive forming a dish with a slope at the center. The curvature in the clamped plate is negative so that a\ncusp is formed with a discontinuous slope at the center. This difference could be clearly seen from a blown-up graph\nof the velocity field near the center of the plate.\n4.3\nPlastic Resistance of a Circular Membrane\nLet us consider a similar problem of a thin circular membrane under a uniformly distributed pressure, discussed\nin Section 4.2.3 of Part I. The only difference is that the membrane is rigid-plastic. From the strain-displacement\nrelation, Eq.(206 of Part I) we can calculate the rate of strains\nδu r\nδw δw\nε rr =\n+\n(79)\nδr\nδr δr\nu r\nε θθ =\n(80)\nr\nAssuming that ur = 0 meaning that trajectories of all material points move vertically, Eqs.(79) and (80) reduce to\nδw δw\nε rr =\n,\nε θθ = 0\n(81)\nδr δr\nFrom the above information one can uniquely determine the components of the membrane forces. Because the radial\nand circumferential directions are principal directions, Eq.(44) in expanded notation gives\n2 εrr + εθθ\nNr =\nN0 p\n(82)\n( ε2 +\nε θθ + ε2 )\nrr\nεvv\nθθ\n2 εθθ + εrr\nNθ =\nN0 p\n(83)\nε2\n( rr + εvvε θθ + εθθ)\nSubstituting the expression for the strain rates given by Eq.(81) to Eq.(83), the corresponding membrane forces are\nNrr = √\n3 N0,\nNθθ = √\n3 N0\n(84)\nSuch a field of membrane forces is approximate, as it does not satisfy the symmetry condition Nr = Nθ at the plate\ncenter. This is a consequence of a simplified assumption u r = 0.\nThe surface element in the membrane is subject to bi-axial tension of a constant magnitude over the structure\nno matter what is the size and shape of the function w(r). This is a great simplification because the terms Nrr is a\nconstant in the equation of equilibrium (205 in Part I),\n2 d\ndw\nN0 √\n3 dr (r dr ) + rp = 0\n(85)\nIntegrating the above equation twice one gets\n√\n3 pr\nw(r) = - 8 N0\n+ C1 ln r + C2\n(86)\nThe integration constant C1 should vanish because otherwise the central deflection of the membrane will go to infinity.\nThe integration constant C2 is found from zero displacement at the clamped edge w(r = R) = 0. The final solution\nis\n√\n3pR2\nr 2\nw(r) = 8N0\n(1 - ( R ))\n(87)\n\nZ\nZ\nIn particular, the relation between the pressure and the central deflection w0 is\np = √8\n3 σ0( R\nh )2 w\nh\n(88)\nA comparison of the bending and membrane solutions is presented in the figure.\nA transition between the bending and membrane response (intersection point of two lines), occurs when central\ndeflection reaches 3\n4 of the thickness. In reality a transition from bending to membrane action occurs more gradually\nwhen deflection becomes of an order of plate thickness. Despite the approximate nature of the above analytical\nsolution with zero in-plane displacement and parabolic shape of the transverse deflection w(r), its accuracy is very\ngood. This can be seen from a comparison of the prediction of Eq.(87) with the finite element calculation, shown in\nthe figure below.\n4.4\nAxial Crushing of a Prismatic Tube\nThe prismatic tube of a circular cross-section subjected to large axial load deforms plastically in the axi-symmetric\nor diamond mode. Thicker tubes with the radius-to-thickness ratio R/h < 20 fold by forming axi-symmetric bellows\nwhile thinner tubes crumple in the diamond mode, as shown in the figure below. When the loading and respons is\nrotationally symmetric, the in-plane shear forces and twisting moment vanish, Nrθ = Mrθ = 0 and the components\nof the generalized forces become\nNαβ =\n, Mαβ =\n(89)\nNθ\nMθ\nNz\nMz\nIn the absence of a lateral pressure, the principle of virtual velocities, Eq.(51) reduces to\n(Mαβ κ αβ + Nαβ ε αβ )ds =\nN zu zdΓ = Pu\n(90)\nS\nΓ\nwhere u is a uniform compressive rate of displacement and P = 2πR N is the total (still unknown) compressive\nforce. Further simplifications are introduced by making assumptions about the strain rate field. It was observed\n\nX\nin tests that the tube walls are inextensible in the axial direction so that εz = 0. Furthermore, the change in the\ncircumferential curvature is much smaller than in the axial curvature, thus κθ = 0. The integrand of Eq.(90) reduces\nto (Mz κ z + Nθε θ), where (Mz , Mθ) are related by the yield condition.\nFinally, the square yield condition, circumscribed on the exact yield condition (see p. 8 of Part II) is assumed\nand the stress state is approximated by Mz = M0 and Nθ = N0. Now, the principle of virtual velocities is reduced\nto\nZ\nZ\n2πR[M0\nκz dz + N0\nε θdz] = P u\n(91)\nL\nL\nThe bending and membrane rate of energies are calculated separately by assuming a suitable deformation mode.\nThe first observation is that the process of plastic folding is progressive with one fold formed at a time. Therefore,\nthe integration over the lateral surface can be performed over the length 2H of the folding wave.\n2H\nu\nw0\nw(z)\nH\nH\nv1\nA\nB\nC\nds\nIn an actual metal tube the folds are smooth and continuous. The computational model is simplified and consists\nof straight segments between the hinge circles. Taking the angle α as the process parameter, the tube shortening is\nu = 2H(1-cos α), and its rate is u = 2Hα sin α. The instantaneous amplitude of the lateral velocity is w = Hα cos α.\nThe bending rate of energy is calculated first:\nZ\nE b = 2πRM0\nκ zdz = 2πRM0\n|θ i|\n(92)\n2H\ni=1\nThere are three plastic hinge circles A, B, C where the rate of rotation are θ A = α , θ B = 2 α, and θ C = α . Thus,\nEq.(92) yields E b = 8πRM0α . The hoop strain rate is defined by\nw\nε θ =\n(93)\nR\nand thus the rate of membrane energy is\nZ H w 0\nE m = 2πRN0 · 2\nds\n(94)\nR\nwhere ds is the element length of the fold and the coefficient 2 accounts for the two halves. In the present model the\ninstantaneous velocity field is a linear function of the deformed coordinates\nw(s) = w0\ns\nH\n(95)\nPerforming the integration, the final expression for the rate of membrane energy is\nEm = 2πN0 w0H2\n(96)\nSubstituting the calculated values into the principle of virtual velocity, Eq.(91) gives\nH2\n2HP α sin α = 8πM0α + 2πN0α\ncos α\n(97)\nR\n\nr\np\nr\nr\nwhere α changes from α = 0 at the beginning of the process to α = π\n2 at the end. Integrating Eq.(97) with respect\nto the process parameter α gives an expression for the mean crushing force Pm:\n2π2M0\nPm =\nR + πN0H\n(98)\nH\nThe dependence of the mean crushing force on the unknown length H of the folding wave is shown in the figure\nbelow.\nIt is plausible to assume that the folding wave adjusts itself in the crushing process to minimize the magnitude\nof the mean crushing force. Indeed, the analytical minimum exists when\ndPm\n2π2M0\n= -\nR + πN0 = 0\n(99)\ndH\nH2\nfrom which the optimum value of H is found\n2πM0R\nHopt =\n(100)\nN0\nSubstituting Eq.(100) back into Eq.(98), the best estimate of the mean crushing force is\nPm = 2π 2πM0N0R\n(101)\nIn the literature, analytical expressions for the normalized mean crushing force were derived. Dividing both sides\nof Eq.(101) by M0, the dimensionless mean crushing force becomes a function of the diameter-to-thickness ratio:\nPm = 2π\n√\n4π\n2R u 22.27\n2R\n(102)\nM0\nh\nh\nIn physical quantities using the definitions of M0 and N0, Eq.(102) reads\nPm = 7.87σ0h\n2 R\n(103)\nIn reality, not the entire crushing distance 2H is available. The tube shortening during the formation of a typical\nfold is 0.75(2H). With the correction for the effective crushing distance, the coefficient in Eq.(103) is increased, to\ngive\nPm = 9.44σ0h\n2 R\n(104)\n\nDespite many simplifying assumptions, the present solution provides a good estimate of the mean crushing force\nand energy absorption of tubes. The prediction of Eq.(104) is compared with test results and other solutions in the\ngraph below.\nCourtesy Elsevier, Inc., http://www.sciencedirect.com.

Strain Measure\n1.1.1\nEngineering Strain\nEngineering strain ε is defined as the relative displacement:\nε = ds - ds0\n(1)\nds0\nwhere ds0 is the increment of initial lenght and ds is the increment of current length.\n1.1.2\nGreen-Lagrangian Strain\nInstead of comparing the length, one can compare the square of lengths:\nE = ds2 - ds2\n(2)\n2ds2\nds - ds0 ds + ds0\n=\nds0\n2ds0\nWhere ds\nds0, the second term is Eq. (2) tends to unity, and the Green strain\n→\nmeasure and the engineering strain become identical. Equation (2) can be put into\nan equivalnet form:\nds2 - ds2\n0 = 2Eds2\n(3)\nwhich will now be generalized to the 3-D case.\n1.2\n3-D Strain Measure\n1.2.1\nDerivation of Green-Lagrangian Strain Tensor for Plates\nLet define the following quanties:\n- a = [ai]: vector of the initial (material) coordinate system\n- x = [xi]: vector of the current (spatial) coordinate system\n- u = [ui]: displacement vector\nwhere the index i = 1, 2, 3. The relation between those quantities is:\nxi = ai + ui\n(4)\ndxi = dai + dui\n\na\nu\nx\ndu\nda\ndx\na\nu\nx\ndu\nda\ndx\nO\nNow, the squares of the initial and the current length increment can be written\nin terms of ai and ui:\nds2\n0 = daidajδij\n(5)\nds2 = dxidxj δij\n(6)\n= (dai + dui) (daj + duj ) δij\nwhere the Kronecker tensor δij reads:\nδij =\n\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n\n(7)\n0 0 1\nThe vector u can be considered as a function of:\n- the initial (material) coordinate system, u (a), which leads to Lagrangian\ndescripion, or\n- the current (spatial) coordinates, u (x), which leads to the Eulerian descrip\ntion\nIn structural mechanics, the Lagrangian description is preferable:\nui = ui (ai)\n(8)\n∂ui\ndui =\ndak = ui,k dak\n∂ak\n∂uj\nduj =\ndal = uj ,l dal\n∂al\nLet us calculated the difference in the length square:\nds2 - ds2\n0 = (dai + dui) (daj + duj) δij - daidaj δij\n(9)\n\nUsing Eq. (8) and the definition of δij, the difference in the length square can be\ntransformed into:\nds2 - ds2\n0 = (duj dai + duidaj + duiduj ) δij\n(10)\n= (uj ,l dal dai + ui,k dak daj + ui,k dak uj,l dal) δij\n= [uj ,l (dajδjl) dai + ui,k (daiδik) daj + ui,k uj,l (daiδik) (dajδjl)] δij\n= (uj ,i +ui,j +ui,k uj ,k ) daidaj\n= 2Eij daidaj\nwhere, by analogy with the 1-D case, the Lagrangian or Green strain tensor Eij is\ndefined:\nEij =\n(ui,j +uj ,i +uk,i uk,j )\n(11)\nIn the case of small displacement gradient (uk,i ¿ 1), the second nonlinear term\ncan be neglected leading to the defintion of the infinitesimal strain tensor:\nεij =\n(ui,j +uj ,i )\n(12)\nFrom the defintion, the strain tensor is symmetric εij = εji, which can be seen by\nintechanign the indices i for j and j for i. In the moderately large deflection theory\nof structures, the nonlinear terms are important. Therefore, Eq. (11) will be used\nas a starting point in the development of the general theory of plates.\nComponents of Green-Lagrangian Strain Tensor Let define the following\nrange convention for indices:\n- Greek letters: α, β, ... = 1, 2\n- Roman letters: i, j, ... = 1, 2, 3\nWith this range convention, the Roman letters are also written as:\ni = α, 3\n(13)\nj = β, 3\nThe Lagrangian or Green strain tensor can be expressed:\nij\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nαβ\nβ\nα\n=\n=\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n\"\n\"\n\"\n#\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\" #\n\"\n\n#\n#\nwhere Eαβ is the in-plane component of strain tensor, Eα3 and E3β are out-of-plane\n\nlece\nshear components of strain tensor, and E33 is the through-thickness component of\nstrain tensor. Similarily, displacement vector can be divided into two components:\nui =\nu\nu\n\"\n=\nu\nv\n\"\n=\n\"\nw\nw\nu3\nuα\nwhere uα is the in-plane components of the displacement vector, and u3 = w is the\nout-of-plane components of the displacement vector and also called as the trans\nverse displacement.\nInitial Undeformed Configuration\nx\nz\nη\nξ\nmidd\nsurfa\nDeformed Configuration\na\nx\nu\nuα\nu\nAssumptions of the von Karman Theory The von Karman thoery of mod\nerately large deflection of plates assumes:\n1. The plate is thin.\nThe thickness h is much smaller than the typical plate\ndimension, h\nL.\n¿\n2. The magnitude of the transverse deflection is of the same order as the thickness\nof plate, |w| = O (h). In practice, the present theory is still a good engineering\napproximation for deflections up to ten plate thickness.\n\n3. Gradients of in-plane displacements uα,β are small so that their product or\nsquare can be neglected.\n4. Love-Kirchhoff hypothesis is satisfied.\nIn-plane displacements are a linear\nfunction of the z-coordiate (3-coordinate).\nuα = u*\nα - z u3,α\n(14)\nwhere u*\nα is the displacement of the middle surface, which is independent of\nz-coordinate, i.e. uα\n*,3 = 0; and u3,α is the slope which is negative for the\n\"smiling\" beam.\nz\n5. The out-of-plane displacement is independent of the z-coordiante, i.e. u3,3 =\n0.\n1.2.2\nSpecification of Strain-Displacement Relation for Plates\nIn the theory of moderately large deflections, the strain-displacement relation can\nbe specified for plates.\nIn-Plane Terms of the Strain Tensors From the general expression, Eq. (11),\nthe 2-D in-plane componets of the strain tensor are:\nEαβ =\n(uα,β +uβ ,α +uk,α uk,β )\n(15)\nHere, consider the last, nonlinear term:\nuk,α uk,β = u1,α u1,β +u2,α u2,β +u3,α u3,β\n(16)\n= uγ,α uγ ,β +u3,α u3,β\nIn the view of the Assumption 3, the first term in the above equation is zero,\nuγ,α uγ ,β ' 0. Therefore, the 2-D in-plane components of strain tensor reads:\nEαβ =\n(uα,β +uβ,α +w,α w,β )\n(17)\n\nwhere w = u3. Introducing Eq. (14) into Eq. (17), i.e. applying Love-Kirchhoff\nhypothesis, one gets:\n£\nw,β\n¤\n(18)\n¢\nFrom the definiton of the curvature, one gets:\n¡\n¡\n¡\nEαβ =\n(uα\n*- z w,α ) ,β +\n,α +w,α\nu*\nβ - z w,β\n¢\n1 u*\nα,β +u*\nβ,α -2 z w,αβ +\n=\nw,α w,β\n¢\nu*\nα,β +u*\nβ,α - z w,αβ +\n=\nw,α w,β\nκαβ = -w,αβ\n(19)\nNow, Eq. (18) can be re-casted in the form:\nEαβ =\nαβ + z καβ\n(20)\nE*\nwhere the strain tensor of the middle surface E*\nis composed of a linear and a\nαβ\nnonlinear term:\n¢\n1 w,α w,β\n(21)\n¡\nIn the limiting case of small displacements, the second term can be neglected as\ncompared to the first term. In the classical bending theory of plate, the in-plane\ndisplacements are assumed to be zero uα = 0 so that strains are only due to the\ncurvatue:\nEαβ = z καβ\n(22)\nE*\nαβ\nu*\nα,β +u*\nβ,α +\n= 2\nwhere\nκαβ =\n\nκ11 κ12\nκ21 κ22\n= -\n\n= -w,αβ\n(23)\n∂2w\n∂2w\n∂x2\n∂x∂y\n∂2w\n∂2w\n∂x∂y\n∂y2\nIn the above equation, κ11 and κ22 are curvatures of the cylindrical bending, and\nκ12 is the twist which tells how the slope in the x-direction changes with the\ny-direction:\n∂μ ∂w\n∂x\n¶\nκ12 = ∂y\nfor a cylinder\nκ =\n\nInterpretation of the linear terms: 1\n2 uα\n*,β +u*\nβ,α\nEach component can\nbe expressed in the followings:\ndu1\nε11 =\n(u1,1 +u1,1 ) = u1,1 =\n(24)\ndx\ndu2\nε22 =\n(u2,2 +u2,2 ) = u2,2 =\n(25)\ndy\nμ\n¶\ndu1\ndu2\nε12 =\n(u1,2 +u2,1 ) =\n+\n(26)\ndy\ndx\n1 du1\nε12|if u2=0 = 2 dy\nε11\nu2 ≡ 0\ny\nx\nε\ny\nx\nε\nu\ny\nx\nTherefore, ε11 and ε22 are the tensile strain in the two directions, and ε12 is the\nchange of angles, i.e. shear strain.\nInterpretation of the nonlinear term: 2\n1 w,α w,β\nLet α = 1 and β = 1.\nThen, the nonlienar term reads:\n2w,α w,β\n\nα=1,β=1\n= 1\ndw\ndx\ndw\ndx = 1\nμdw\ndx\n¶2\n(27)\nOne can also obtain the same quantity by the defintion of 1-D Green-Lagrangian\nstrain:\n¡\n¢\nμ\n¶2\nμ\n¶2\nds2 - ds2\nds2\n0 + dw2 - ds2\ndw\ndw\nE =\n2ds0\n0 '\n2ds0\n0 = 2\nds0\n= 2\ndx\n(28)\n\ndx\nx\nds0 = dx\nds0\nds2 = ds0\n2 + dw2\ndw\nds\n,z w\nThus, the conclusion is that the nonlinear term 1\n2 w,α w,β represents the change of\nlength of the plate element due to finite rotations.\nOut-Of-Plane Terms of the Strain Tensors Refering to the definition intro\nduced in Section 1.2.1, there are three other componets of the strain tensor: E3β,\nEα3 and E33. Using the general expression for the components of the strain tensor,\nEq. (11), it can be shown that the application of Assumption 4 and 5 lead to the\nfollowing expressions:\nE3β =\n(u3,β +uβ,3 +uk,3 uk,β )\n(29)\n=\n[u3,β +uβ,3 + (u1,3 u1,β +u2,3 u2,β +u3,3 u3,β )]\n=\n[u3,β -u3,β + (-u3,1 u1,β -u3,2 u2,β )]\n=\n(-u3,1 u1,β -u3,2 u2,β )\n=\nw,γ uγ ,β\n-2\nEα3 =\n(uα,3 +u3,α +uk,α uk,3 )\n(30)\n=\n[uα,3 +u3,α + (u1,α u1,3 +u2,α u2,3 +u3,α u3,3 )]\n=\n[-u3,α +u3,α + (-u1,α u3,1 -u2,α u3,2 )]\n=\n(-u1,α u3,1 -u2,α u3,2 )\n=\nw,γ uγ,α\n-2\n\nE33 =\n(u3,3 +u3,3 +uk,3 uk,3 )\n(31)\nh\ni\n= u3,3 +\n(u1,3 ) + (u2,3 ) + (u3,3 )\nh\ni\n=\n(u1,3 ) + (u2,3 )\n2 h\ni\n= 1 (-u3,1 )2 + (-u3,2 )2\n= w,γ w,γ\nThe above are all second order terms which vanish for small deflection theory of\nplates. In the theory of moderately larege deflection of plates, the out-of-plate shear\nstrains as well as the through-thickness strain is not zero. Therefore, an assumption\n\"plane remains plane,\" expressed by Eq. (14), does not mean that \"normal remains\nnormal.\" The existance of the out-of-plane shear strain means that lines originally\nnormal to the middle surface do not remain normal to the deformed plate. However,\nthe incremental work of these strains with the corresponding stresses is negligible:\nE3βσ3β, Eα3σα3 and E33σ33, are small\n(32)\nbecause the corresponding stress σ3β, σα3 and σ33 are small as compared to the\nin-plane stress σαβ .\nOne can conclude that the elastic strain energy (and even\nplastic dissipation) is well approximated using the plane strain assumption:\nZ\nZ\nσijεijdz '\nσαβ εαβdz\n(33)\nh\nh\n\nDerivation of Constitutive Equations for Plates\n2.1\nDefinitions of Bending Moment and Axial Force\nHook's law in plane stress reads:\nE\nσαβ =\n[(1 - ν) εαβ + ν εγγ δαβ]\n(34)\n1 - ν2\nIn terms of components:\nE\nσxx =\n(εxx + ν εyy)\n(35)\n1 - ν2\nE\nσyy =\n(εyy + ν εxx)\n1 - ν2\nE\nσxy =\nεxy\n1 + ν\nHere, strain tensor can be obtained from the strain-displacement relations:\nεαβ\n*\nαβ\n(36)\n= εαβ + z κ\nNow, define the tensor of bending moment:\nZ\nh\nMαβ ≡\nσαβ z dz\n(37)\nh\n-\nand the tensor of axial force (membrane force):\nZ\nh\nNαβ ≡\nσαβ dz\n(38)\nh\n-\n2.2\nBending Energy\n2.2.1\nBending Moment\nLet us assume that ε*\n= 0.

The smallest integer value is n = 1\nwhich gives the following buckling mode.\n\nThe Donnell solution should be compared with more exact solution of the ring\nbuckling problem which take into account a more complex incremental displacement\nfield with both w (θ) and v (θ). Here, a distinction should be made between the\ncentrally directed pressure (as in all preceding analysis) and the field -pressure\nloading where pressure is always directed normal to the deformed surface.\nIn the later case, the ring buckling occurs at:\n¡\n¢ EI\nQc = n 2 - 1 a3\n(440)\nwhere the smallest integer n = 2 so that Q = 3EI/a3 . The buckling mode has now\neight nodal points rather than four.\nThe solution of centrally directed pressure loading case is:\nQc =\n¡\nn2\n- 1\n¢2 EI\n(441)\nn - 2\na\nwhere again the smallest n = 2. Thus the smallest buckling load intensity is:\nEI\nQc = 4.5 3\n(442)\na\nIt is seen that for a realistic value n=2, the present solution, Eq. (439) gives\nthe buckling pressure between the two cases of field-pressure loading and centrally\ndirected loading, 3 < 4 < 4.5.\n5.5\nBuckling under Hydrostatic Pressure\nSpecial case of the combined loading in which the total axial load P is:\nP = πa2 q\n(443)\n\nThe pre-buckling solution is given by Eq. (394). The solution of the buckling equa\ntion still can be sought through the sinusoidal function, Eq. (401). The optimum\nsolution can be found by a trial and error method varying parameters m and n . A\ngraphical representation of the solution is shown in figure below.\n5.6\nBuckling under Torsion\nA twist applied to one end of a cylindrical shell process a twisting force Nxθ:\nM\nN*=\n(444)\nxθ\n2πa\nThe other two components of the pre-buckling membrane forces vanish N*= N*=\nxx\nθθ\n0. Moreover, the force is constant.\n\nUnder these conditions, the governing equation reduces to:\n8 w +\nN*\n4 w,xθ = 0\n(445)\nD∇\n1 -\na2\nν2\nC w,xxxx + a\nxθ ∇\nIn view of the presence of odd-ordered derivatives in the above equation, the sep\narable form of the solution for w (x, θ), assumed previously, does not satisfy the\nequation.\nUnder torsional loading, the buckling deformation consists of circumferential\nwaves that spiral around the cylindrical shell from one end to the other.\nSuch\nwaves can be represented by a deflection function of the form:\n\nx\nw (x, θ) = C sin m a - nθ\n(446)\nwith\nmπa\nm =\n(447)\nL\nwhere m and n are integers. The alone displacement field satisfy the differential\nequation and the periodical condition is the circumferential direction, but does not\nsatisfy any commonly used boundary at the cylinder ends.\nConsequently, this\nsimple examples can be used only for long cylinders.\nFor such cylinders, introduction of the additional displacement field into the\ngoverning equation, yields:\n¡\nm 2 + n\n¢2 D\nm\n¡\n¢\nN*=\n+\n2 C\n(448)\nxθ\n2 m n a2\n2 ( m2 + n2)2 n\n1 - v\nFor sufficiently long cylinders, the shell buckles in two circumferential waves, n = 2.\nAlso, the term m 2 is small compared with 4. Then, the approximate expression is:\n4 D\nm 3 ¡\n¢\nN*=\n+\n2 C\n(449)\nxθ\nm a2\n64 1 - v\nAn analytical minimization of the alone experiment with repeat to m gives:\nμ ¶2\nh\nm 4 =\n(450)\n9 (1 - ν2)\na\n\nUpon substitution, the final expression for the buckling force, or better, critical\nshear strain causing buckling is:\nμ ¶3/2\nN*\n0.272 E\nh\nτcr =\nxθ =\n(451)\nh\n(1 - ν2)3/4\na\nThe above solution was given by Donnell. As noted, the above solution is invalid\nfor short shells due to the difficulties in satisfying boundary condition.\nA more\nrigorous analytical-numerical solution is shown in the figure below.\nAs the radius of the shell approaches infinity, the critical stress coefficient for\nsimply supported and clamped edge approaches respectively the value 5.35 and 8.98\ncorresponding to plates under the shear loading.\n5.7\nInfluence of Imperfection and Comparison with Experiments\nBecause of the presence of unavoidable imperfection in real shells, the experimen\ntally measured buckling load are much smaller than the ones found theoretically.\nReduction in the\nbuckling strength\ndue to imperfection\nComparison of theoretical and experimental results for four different type of loads:\n\n- Axial compression\nTorsion\n-\n- Lateral pressure\n- Hydrostatic pressure\nare shown in the subsequent two pages. Note that the graphs were presented\nin log - log scale. Replotting the results for axially loaded plate yields the graph\nshown below.\n1.1\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n2,500\n3,000\n3,500\nTheory\nA design recommendation\ns cr = 0.605 Eh/a\ns exp\na\nh\nDistribution of test data for cylinders subjected to axial compression.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nThe differences are shown to be very large. Design curves for cylindrical and\nother shells are based on the theoretical solution modified by empirical prediction\nfactors called \"know-down factors\".\nFor example, the solid curve shown in the\nreceding page is a \"90 percent probability curve.\" For a/h = 50, the reduction\nfactor predicted by this probability curve is 0.24. Thus, the theoretical solution\nσcr = 0.605 Eh/a should be multiplied by 0.24 for the design stress σ = 0.15 Eh/a.\nCylindrical shells loaded in different way are been sensitive to imperfections and\nthe resulting knock-down factors are smaller.\nMost industrial organization establish their own design criteria. They are fre\nquently loose-leaf and are continuously updated on the volume of the experimented\nevidence increase. The situation can be converted to the firmly established manual\n\nof steel constructions for the design of columns and beam. The reason is that col\numn are not sensitive to imperfection as far as the ultimate strength is concerned."
