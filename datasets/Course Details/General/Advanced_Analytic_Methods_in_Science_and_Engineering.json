The discussions did not cover all the topics in the chapter. Rather, they aimed to communicate the basics and make it easier for the students to read the materials in these chapters on their own. While these materials were not tested in the exams, they are fundamental and it is important for the students to learn them well. It was not a requirement for students to hand in the homeworks in the lectures, but students had to do as many as they could on their own.\n\nThe following topics were covered in detail:\n\nSeries solutions of linear homogeneous ODE. Discussed how to make expansions around irregular as well as regular singular points.\n\nThe WKB Method. Covered not only the lowest-order WKB approximation but also the higher-order WKB approximations.\n\nAsymptotic expansion of integrals. Covered the Laplace method, the method of stationary phase, and the saddle point method.\n\nBoundary layer theory. Demonstrated how to solve the standard boundary layer problems. Discussed some of the boundary layer problems either considered unsolvable or solved incorrectly in the literature.\n\nSmall non-linear oscillations. This includes the two-scale method, the counter term method in renormalized perturbation and the method of renormalization group.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nComplex Variables with Applications (\n18.04\n), or Advanced Calculus for Engineers (18.075) or Functions of a Complex Variable (18.112)\n\nTextbook\n\nCheng, Hung.\nAdvanced Analytic Methods in Continuum Mathematics:\n\nFundamentals for Science and Engineering.\nBoston, MA: Luban Press, 2004.

Problem 1.(5x5+5pts) Find and classify the singular points (including inf)\nfor the following ODE:\n(a)\nxy00 + (c -x)y0 -ay = 0 (confluent hypergeometric equation)\n(b)\nx(1 -x)y00 + [c -(a + b + 1)x]y0 -aby = 0. (hypergeometric equation)\n(c)\ny00 -(x4 -3\n16x-2)y = 0.\n(d)\ny00 +(x2 + 3\n16x-2)y = 0.\n(e)\ny00 + (ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2)y = 0, ν a constant. (parabolic cylinder equation)\nThe recurrence formula for the last equation involves three different an.Find a\nchange of the dependable variable so that the recurrence formula for the trans-\nformed equation involves only two different an.\nWe recall that, in order to find the behaviour of the solution at very large values of x, it is\nconvenient to let t = 1\nx, in which case we have\nd\ndx\n=\nd\nd(1\nt) = -t2 d\ndt\nd2\ndx2\n=\nt2 d\ndt(t2 d\ndt) = t4 d2\ndt2 + 2t3 d\ndt\nThus a second order differential equation of the form\ny\n00 + C(x)y0 + D(x)y = 0\ntransforms into\nd2y\ndt2 + 2t -C(1\nt)\nt2\ndy\ndt + D(1\nt)\nt4\ny = 0\n(1)\nSolution:\n(a) (confluent hypergeometric equation) First we put the equation into the form\ny00 + ( c\nx -1)y0 -a\nxy = 0\nwhich is the right form the behaviour of the points.\nThe point x = 0 is not an ordinary point since the function ( c\nx -1) is not analytic at x = 0\n(in case c 6= 0).Furthermore, since x( c\nx -1) and x2(-a\nx) are both analytic, x = 0 is a regular\nsingular point.x = inf. Using (1), our equation transforms into\nd2y\ndt2 + 2t -(ct -1)\nt2\ndy\ndt -at\nt4 y = 0\nand hence x = infis an irregular singular point of rank 1.\n\n(b) (hypergeometric equation)\nx(1 -x)y00 + [c -(a + b + 1)x]y0 -aby = 0\n⇒\ny00 + [c -(a + b + 1)x]\nx(1 -x)\ny0 -\nab\nx(1 -x)y = 0\nx = 0 and x = 1 are regular singular points except some special values of the parameters\na, b and c. For x = inf, we use (1) to obtain\nd2y\ndt2 + (2 -c)t + (a + b -1)\n(t -1)t\ndy\ndt -\nab\nt2(t -1)y = 0\nHence, x = infis a regular singular point except some special values of the parameters a and\nb.\n(c) y00 -(x4 -3\n16x-2)y = 0.\nClearly, x = 0 is a regular singular point. With t = 1\nx, we have\nd2y\ndt2 + 2\nt\ndy\ndt -(t-4 -3\n16t2)\nt4\ny = 0\nTherefore x = infis an irregular singular point of rank 3. c.y00 -(x4 -3\n16x-2)y = 0.\n(d) y00 + (x2 + 3\n16x-2)y = 0.\nClearly, x = 0 is a regular singular point. With t = 1\nx, we have\nd2y\ndt2 + 2\nt\ndy\ndt + (t-2 + 3\n16t2)\nt4\ny = 0\nTherefore x = infis an irregular singular point of rank 2.\n(e) y00 + (ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2)y = 0.\nSince the function multiplying y is analytic everywhere, all the points except possibly x = inf\nare ordinary points.\nFor x = inf, using (1), we obtain the transformed equation to be\nd2y\ndt2 + 2\nt\ndy\ndt +\nμ(ν + 1\n2)t2 -1\nt6\n¶\ny = 0\nwhere t = 1\nx. Hence we see that x = infis an irregular singular point of rank 2.\nFor the last part of the question, we observe that the original form of the equation has\n\"operators of three different orders\":\n* D2 : order -2\n* (ν + 1\n2) : order 0\n\n* -1\n4x2 : order +2\nThis will lead to three different types of an terms in the recurrence formula. Indeed, if we\nlet\ny =\nX\nanxn\nin the original parabolic cylinder equation, we arrive at the recurrence formula\nann(n -1) + (ν + 1\n2)an-2 -1\n4an-4 = 0\nfrom which it is hard, if not impossible, to obtain an explicit formula for an's. We are asked\nto make a change of the dependable variable in order to get away form this problem. We\ntentatively let\ny = uY\nwhere u is a function of x. Then\n[D2 + (ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2)]uY = u[(D + u0\nu )2 + (ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2)]Y = 0\nHence\n[(D + u0\nu )2 + (ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2)]Y = 0\nWe look more closely at\n(D + u0\nu )2 + ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2 = D2 + u0\nu D + Du0\nu + (u0\nu )2 + ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2\n(2)\nHere we shall either eliminate the order -2 term which is -1\n4x2, or all terms with order 0.\nThe former seems easier, if we let\n(u0\nu )2 -1\n4x2 = 0\nthen a solution to this will be\nu0\nu = -1\n2x ⇒u = e-1\n4x2\nPutting this into (2), we obtain\n(D2 + xD + ν)Y = 0\nas our transformed differential equation. This formulation will not have the problems that\nthe older had, as we have only operators of two different orders, namely D2 with order -2,\nand (xD + ν) with order 0.\nProblem 2(7x5pts):Find the Maclaurin series solutions for the equations in prob-\nlem 1. In what region is each of the series convergent?\n(a)\nxy00 + (c -x)y0 -ay = 0 (Confluent Hypergeometric Equation)\n\nSince we showed in problem 1 that x = 0 is a regular singular point, we seek a solution in\nthe form of a Frobenius series:\ny(x) =\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nanxn+s; an = 0 if n < 0\nwhere s is some constant to be determined later.\nHowever, since coefficient of y is not\nsingular, one solution can still be obtained by expanding Taylor Series. Because, the indicial\nequation, which can be obtained by putting y = xs, and considering only the lowest order\noperators, will have the root s = 0.\nAfter this remark, we proceed as we should, by the Frobenius Series:\ny0 =\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n + s)anxn+s-1, y00 =\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n + s)(n + s -1)anxn+s-2\n(3)\nSubstituting this series into the original equation, we obtain\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n + s)(n + s -1)anxn+s-2 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nc(n + s)anxn+s-1 -\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + s) + a]anxn+s = 0\nRelabeling indices,\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + 1 + s)(n + s)an+1 + [c(n + 1 + s) -(n + s) -a]an]xn+s = 0\nAnd the recurrence relation is\n(n + s + 1)(n + s + c)an+1 -(n + s + a)an = 0\nSetting n = -1 yields (a-1 = 0, a0 6= 0) the indicial equation\ns(s -1 + c) = 0\nTherefore s can take two values, either s = 0 or s = 1 -c. We'll treat each case separately:\nFor s = 0,\nan+1 =\nn + a\n(n + 1)(n + c)an\nwhere c cannot be a negative integer, or zero. Then,\nan\n=\nn -1 + a\nn(n -1 + c)an-1\n=\n(n -1 + a)(n -2 + a)(1 + a)\nn!(n -1 + c)(n -2 + c)...(1 + c)ca0\n=\nΓ(n + a)Γ(c)\nΓ(a)Γ(n + 1)Γ(n + c)a0\nTherefore the solution corresponding to s = 0 must be proportional to\ny1(x)=Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n+a)\nn!Γ(n+c)xn\n\nFor s = 1 -c,\nan+1 =\nn + 1 -c + a\n(n + 2 -c)(n + 1)an\nor\nan =\nn -c + a\n(n + 1 -c)n)an-1\nwhere c 6= 2, 3, 4, ... Then we find\nan = Γ(n + 1 + a -c)Γ(2 -c)\nΓ(1 + a -c)Γ(n + 2 -c)a0\nand the second solution is proportional to\ny2(x)=x1-c Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n+1+a-c)\nn!Γ(n+2-c) xn\nThis will be independent from y1(x) provided c 6= 1. The general solution of the confluent\nhypergeometric equation will be a linear combination of y1(x) and y2(x).\nAs can be seen by applying the ratio test, both series are convergent for |x| < inf.\n(b) x(1 -x)y00 + [c -(a + b + 1)x]y0 -aby = 0. (hypergeometric equation)\nx = 0 is a regular singular point, and so the solution is in the form of a Frobenius series\ny(x) =\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nanxn+s; an = 0 if n < 0\nand y0 and y00 are the same as before.Also same remarks apply as in (a). Substituting, we\nobtain\n0 =\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n + s)(n + s -1)anxn+s-1 -\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n + s)(n + s -1)anxn+s\n+\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nc(n + s)anxn+s-1 -\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(a + b + 1)(n + s) + ab]anxn+s\nRelabeling indices,\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + 1 + s)(n + s + c)an+1 -[(n + s)(n + s + a + b) + ab]an]xn+s = 0\nBy equating each term is zero, and factorizing the coefficient of an\n(n + s)(n -1 + s + c)an+1 -(n -1 + s + a)(n -1 + s + b)an-1 = 0\nWith n = 0, the indicial equation is\ns(s + c -1) = 0\n\nTherefore, either s = 0 or s = 1 -c.\nFor s = 0,\nan+1\n=\n(n -1 + a)(n -1 + b)\nn(n -1 + c)\nan-1\n=\n(n -1 + a)(n -2 + a)...a(n -1 + b)(n -2 + b)...b\nn!(n -1 + c)(n -2 + c)...c\na0\nThis is all done assuming that c is not zero, or a negative integer. Then one of the solutions\nis found to be\ny3(x)=Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n+a)Γ(n+b)\nn!Γ(n+c)\nxn\nFor s = 1 -c,\nan\n=\n(n -c + a)(n -c + b)\nn(n + 1 -c)\nan-1\n=\n(n -c + a)(n -1 -c + a)...(1 -c + a)(n -c + b)(n -1 -c + b)...(1 -c + b)\nn!(n + 1 -c)(n + c)...(2 -c)\na0\n=\nΓ(n -c + a + 1)Γ(n -c + b + 1)Γ(2 -c)\nn!Γ(1 -c + a)Γ(1 -c + b)Γ(n + 2 -c) a0\nHere we assumed that c is not positive integer. Then we find\ny4(x)=x1-c Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n+a+1-c)Γ(n+b+1-c)\nn!Γ(n+2-c)\nxn\nAnd the most general solution to the Hypergeometric Equation is a linear combination of\ny3(x) and y4(x), providing that c 6= 0, ±1, ±2, .... The series are convergent for all |x| < 1.\n(c)\ny00 -(x4 -3\n16x-2)y = 0.\nSince we know that x = 0 is a regular singular point, we expand a Frobenius Series y(x) =\nPinf\nn=-infanxn+s; an = 0 if n < 0. Substituting y00 as given in (3) into the equation, we obtain\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nan(n + s)(n + s -1)xn+s-2 -\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nanxn+s+4 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n16anxn+s-2 = 0\n⇒\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n{an[(n + s)(n + s -1) + 3\n16] -an-6}xn-2 = 0\nSetting n = 0 gives the indicial equation (a0 6= 0, a-6 = 0)\ns(s -1) + 3\n16 = 0\nwhich implies either s = 1\n4 or s = 3\n4.\n\nFor s = 1\n4, we have\nan[(n + 1\n4)(n -3\n4) + 3\n16] = an-6\ni.e\nan =\nan-6\nn(n -1\n2)\nThen putting n = 6m, we obtain\na6m =\na6(m-1)\n62m(m -1\n12)\nTherefore, we conclude\na6m =\nΓ(11\n12)\n62mm!Γ(m + 11\n12)a0\nand the solution is proportional to\ny5(x)=x\n4 Pinf\nn=0\nx6n\n62nn!Γ(n+ 11\n12)\nClearly, the series is convergent for all |x| < inf(say, by ratio test).\nFor s = 3\n4,we have\nan[(n + 3\n4)(n -1\n4) + 3\n16] = an-6\ni.e\nan =\nan-6\nn(n + 1\n2)\nThen putting n = 6m, we obtain\na6m =\na6(m-1)\n62m(m + 1\n12)\nTherefore, we conclude\na6m =\nΓ(13\n12)\n62mm!Γ(m + 13\n12)a0\nand the solution is proportional to\ny6(x)=x\n4 Pinf\nn=0\nx6n\n62nn!Γ(n+ 13\n12)\nClearly, the series is convergent for all |x| < inf(say, by ratio test).\nThe general solution to the differential equation will then be a linear combination of those\ntwo solutions, namely y5(x) and y6(x), for |x| < inf.\n(d)\ny00 +(x2 + 3\n16x-2)y = 0.\n\nSince we know that x = 0 is a regular singular point, we expand a Frobenius Series y(x) =\nPinf\nn=-infanxn+s; an = 0 if n < 0. Substituting y00 as given in (3) into the equation, we obtain\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nan(n + s)(n + s -1)xn+s-2 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nanxn+s+2 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n16anxn+s-2 = 0\n⇒\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n{an[(n + s)(n + s -1) + 3\n16] + an-4}xn-2 = 0\nSetting n = 0 gives the indicial equation (a0 6= 0, a-4 = 0)\ns(s -1) + 3\n16 = 0\nwhich implies either s = 1\n4 or s = 3\n4.\nFor s = 1\n4, we have\nan[(n + 1\n4)(n -3\n4) + 3\n16] = -an-4\ni.e\nan = -\nan-4\nn(n -1\n2)\nThen putting n = 4m, we obtain\na4m = (-1)m\na4(m-1)\n42m(m -1\n8)\nTherefore, we conclude\na4m = (-1)m\nΓ(7\n8)\n42mm!Γ(m + 7\n8)a0\nand the solution is proportional to\ny7(x)=x\n4 Pinf\nn=0(-1)n\nx4n\n42nn!Γ(n+ 7\n8)\nClearly, the series is convergent for all |x| < inf(say, by ratio test).\nFor s = 3\n4, we have\nan[(n + 3\n4)(n -1\n4) + 3\n16] = -an-4\ni.e\nan = -\nan-4\nn(n + 1\n2)\nThen putting n = 4m, we obtain\na4m = (-1)m\na4(m-1)\n42m(m + 1\n8)\nTherefore, we conclude\na4m = (-1)m\nΓ(9\n8)\n42mm!Γ(m + 9\n8)a0\n\nand the solution is proportional to\ny8(x)=x\n4 Pinf\nn=0(-1)n\nx4n\n42nn!Γ(n+ 9\n8)\nClearly, the series is convergent for all |x| < inf(say, by ratio test).\nThe general solution of the differential equation then is a linear combination of the two\nsolutions found above.\n(e) y00 + (ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2)y = 0, ν a constant. (parabolic cylinder equation)\nWe remember from problem(1.e) that our transformed equation was\nY 00 -xY + νY = 0\nwhere y = e-1\n4x2Y. Since now x = 0 is an ordinary point, we simply expand the Taylor Series\nY (x) = Pinf\nn=-infanxn. Then Y 00(x) = Pinf\nn=-infn(n -1)anxn-2. Substituting those into the\nequation, we obtain\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nn(n -1)anxn-2 -\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nnanxn +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nνanxn = 0\nor\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2xn -\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n -ν)anxn = 0\nwhich gives\n(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 -(n -ν)an = 0\nThen\nan = (n -2 -ν)\nn(n -1) an-2\n(4)\nLetting n = 2m,\na2m = 2(m -1 -ν\n2)\n22m(m -1\n2) a2(m-1)\nThen\na2m = 2(m -1 -ν\n2)\n22m(m -1\n2) a2(m-1)\nThen\na2m =\nΓ(m -ν\n2)Γ(1\n2)\n2mm!Γ(m + 1\n2)Γ(-ν\n2)a0\nTherefore one of the solutions is proportional to\ny9(x)=e-1\n4x2 Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n-ν\n2 )\n2nn!Γ(n+ 1\n2)x2n\n\nThe series is convergent for all |x| < inf. To find the other solution, we let n = 2m+1 in (4),\nto obtain\na2m+1 = 2m -1 -ν\n2m(2m + 1)a2(m-1)+1 = (m -ν+1\n2 )\n2m(m + 1\n2)a2(m-1)+1\nThen\na2m+1 =\nΓ(m -ν-1\n2 )Γ(1\n2)\n2mm!Γ(m + 3\n2)Γ(-1+ν\n2 )a1\nTherefore one of the solutions is proportional to\ny10(x)=e-1\n4x2 Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n-ν-1\n2 )\n2nn!Γ(n+ 3\n2)x2n+1\nThe series is convergent for all |x| < inf.\nThe general solution can be written as a linear combination of y9(x) and y10(x).\nProblem 3(25pts): Calculate the Quantity\nlim\np→n\nJp(x) -cos πpJ-p(x)\nsin πp\nFrom now on, let us call this quantity Qn(x). Since\nJp(x) = ep log( x\n2)\ninf\nX\nm=0\n(-1)m(x/2)2m\nm!Γ(m + p + 1)\n∂Jp(x)\n∂p\n= log\n3x\n\nJp(x) -\n3x\np\ninf\nX\nm=0\n(-1)m ¡x\n¢2m Γ0(m + p + 1)\nm!Γ2(m + p + 1)\nAnd of course\n∂J-p(x)\n∂p\n= -log\n3x\n\nJ-p(x) +\n3x\n-p\ninf\nX\nm=0\n(-1)m ¡x\n¢2m Γ0(m -p + 1)\nm!Γ2(m -p + 1)\nThe numerator and denominator of Qn(x) both tend to zero as p →n, so we must use\nL'Hopital's Rule to obtain the limit by differentiating the top and bottom with respect to p.\nQn(x) = lim\np→n\n∂Jp(x)\n∂p\n-\n-π sin πpJ-p(x) + cos πp∂J-p(x)\n∂p\n\nπ cos πp\nThe middle term tends to zero in the limit, and since cos πp = (-1)p,\n(-1)nQn(x) = 1\nπ\nμ∂Jn(x)\n∂n\n-(-1)n∂J-n(x)\n∂n\n¶\n\n∴(-1)nQn(x) = 1\nπ\nlog\n3x\n\nJn(x) + (-1)n log\n3x\n\nJ-n(x)\n\n-1\nπ\n3x\nn\ninf\nX\nm=0\n(-1)m ¡x\n¢2m Γ0(m + n + 1)\nm!Γ2(m + n + 1)\n-1\nπ(-1)n 3x\n-n\ninf\nX\nm=0\n(-1)m ¡x\n¢2m Γ0(m -n + 1)\nm!Γ2(m -n + 1)\n∴(-1)nQn(x) =2\nπ log\n3x\n\nJn(x) -\n¡x\n¢n\nπ\ninf\nX\nm=0\n¡\n-1\n4x2¢m Γ0(m + n + 1)\nm!Γ2(m + n + 1)\n-1\nπ\nn-1\nX\nm=0\n(-1)m+n ¡x\n¢2m-n Γ0(m -n + 1)\nm!Γ2(m -n + 1)\n-1\nπ\ninf\nX\nm=n\n(-1)m+n ¡x\n¢2m-n Γ0(m -n + 1)\nm!Γ2(m -n + 1)\n(5)\nwhere I have used the fact that Jn(x) = (-1)nJn(x) to obtain the first log term above. I\nhave also split up the last infinite series into two parts - one involving a sum from zero to\nn -1, and the other from n to inf. The reason for this is because for the third part of\n(-1)nQn(x) above, the arguments of the gamma functions are negative integers and require\nmore analysis. We now consider the three sums separately. If we define ψ(x) = Γ0(x)\nΓ(x) (ψ is\nthen the digamma function), then the first of the sums\n-\n¡x\n¢n\nπ\ninf\nX\nm=0\n¡\n-1\n4x2¢m Γ0(m + n + 1)\nm!Γ2(m + n + 1)\n= -\n¡x\n¢n\nπ\ninf\nX\nm=0\n¡\n-1\n4x2¢m ψ(m + n + 1)\nm!(m + n)!\nThe properties of the Digamma function ψ(x) are not used anywhere in this question - if\nyou're not comfortable with it, just assume it's a shorthand notation for Γ0(x)\nΓ(x) .\nThe last sum in (5) can be simplified by relabelling the summing index.

We have to be\ncareful here, because Γ(x) becomes infinite for negative integers x, and so Γ0(x) is certainly\nnot well defined for negative integers either. If you remember, the ratio of the Gamma\nfunction's derivative to the function squared came originally from differentiating the reciprical\nof the function, when we calculated ∂J-p(x)\n∂p\n. What we require then is\n\nd\ndx\nΓ(x)\n\nm-n+1\n(6)\nUsing the \"reflection formula\" (should be given in Bender and Orszag) Γ(z)Γ(1-z) =\nπ\nsin πz,\nwe have that\nd\ndx\nΓ(x)\n\nm-n+1\n= d\ndx Γ(1 -x)sin πx\nπ\n\nm-n+1\nwhich can be calculated in a straight-forward way. We find that\n-Γ0(m -n + 1)\nΓ2(m -n + 1) = -Γ(n -m)(-1)n-m\nPutting all four parts of Qn(x) together, we finally have\nQn(x)(-1)n =2\nπ log\n3x\n\nJn(x)\n-\n¡x\n¢n\nπ\ninf\nX\nm=0\n¡\n-1\n4x2¢m\nm!(m + n)!(ψ(m + n + 1) + ψ(m + 1))\n-\n¡x\n¢-n\nπ\nn-1\nX\nm=0\nx2\n\n(n -m -1)!\nm!\nThe quantity Qn(x)(-1)n is actually a Bessel function of the second kind, sometimes also\ncalled a Neumann function - denoted usually by Yn(x).

Find c(x) and d(x) and show that both\nof them have a simple pole at x = 0. What do you learn from this example.\nPlugging in y1 and y2 in, we obtain\nc(x) + (1 + x)d(x)\n=\n2 + 2xc(x) + x2d(x)\n=\nSolving this set of equations, we find\nc(x) = -2(x + 1)\nx(x + 2), d(x) =\nx(x + 2)\nwhich, obviously, have simple poles at x = 0.\nTherefore the differential equation in question has a (regular) singular point at x = 0. Yet,\nit has two independent solutions which are analytic everywhere. The moral of this example\nis that, that a differential equation has singularity at a point does not guarantee that it will\nhave singular solutions around that point."

(parabolic cylinder equation)\nSolution:\nPrelimenaries: pages 172-177 in the book.\n(a) Since x = infis an irregular singular point of rank 1, we first make the change of variables\ny = eAxY\nwhich leads to D →D + A, and the ODE becomes\n[(D + A)2 + ( c\nx -1)(D + A) -a\nx]Y = 0\nor\n{D2 + [2A + c\nx -1]D + [A( c\nx -1) + A2 -a\nx]}Y = 0\n(1)\nWith t = 1\nx, we need to find A such that the term 1\nt4d(1\nt) (here d refers to the coefficient\nof y in the original ODE, to see where this comes from, refer to page 177 in the book)\ndoes not have a pole of order higher that (k + 2) = 3. So we need to have the function\nd(1\nt) = Act -A + A2 -at to have a factor of t, which is possible if -A + A2 = 0. Then\neither A = 0 or A = 1. Each case will be treated separately. First, let us take A = 0.\nWe plug\nY =\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nanx-n-s\n(2)\n(in this case y = Y ) into the ODE to obtain\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + s)(n + s + 1) -c(n + s)]anx-n-s-1 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + s) -a]anx-n-s = 0\nwhich leads to, after making n →n -1 in the first summation,\n(n + s -a)an + (n + s -1)(n + s -c)an-1 = 0\nLetting n = 0, we find that s = a. Rewriting,\nan = -(n + s -1)(n + s -c)\n(n + s -a)\nan-1\n\nThus\nan = (-1)nΓ(n + a)Γ(n + 1 + a -c)\nn!Γ(a)Γ(a -c + 1)\none solution is\ny1(x)= x-a Pinf\nn=0(-1)n Γ(n+a)Γ(n+1+a-c)\nn!\nx-n\nTo find the other solution, we let A = 1 in (1), and obtain\n[D2 + (1 + c\nx)D + c -a\nx\n]Y = 0\nAgain, we plug in (2) into this last equation, to obtain\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + s)(n + s + 1) -c(n + s)]anx-n-s-2 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[-(n + s) + c -a]anx-n-s-1 = 0\nwhich gives us, with n →n -1 in the first summation, that\n(n -1 + s)(n + s -c)an-1 -(n + s -c + a)an = 0\nLetting n = 0, we find that s = c -a. Putting this into the last formula, we have\nan = (n -1 + c -a)(n -a)\nn\nan-1\nwhich gives\nan = Γ(n + c -a)Γ(n + 1 -a)\nn!Γ(c -a)Γ(1 -a)\nan-1\nThus, the second solution is\ny2(x)= xa-cex Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n+c-a)Γ(n+1-a)\nn!\nx-n\nThe general solution is\ny(x)=C1x-a Pinf\nn=0(-1)n Γ(n+a)Γ(n+1+a-c)\nn!\nx-n+C2xa-cex Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n+c-a)Γ(n+1-a)\nn!\nx-n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants. Note that series for both of the solutions are\nasymptotic series, they converge nowhere.\n(b) Since x = infis a regular singular point, we directly plug in the series (2) into the ODE\nin question to obtain\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n+s)(n+s+1-c)anx-n-s-1+\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[-(n+s)(n+s+1)+(a+b+1)(n+s)-ab]anx-n-s = 0\nAfter making n →n -1 in the first summation, we obtain\n(n + s -a)(n + s -b)an = (n -1 + s)(n + s -c)an-1\n\nLetting n = 0, we find that either s = a, or s = b. Rewriting the above formula\nan = (n -1 + s)(n + s -c)\n(n + s -a)(n + s -b)an-1\nwhich gives\nan =\nΓ(n + s)Γ(n + 1 + s -c)\nΓ(n + 1 + s -a)Γ(n + 1 + s -b)\nΓ(1 + s -a)Γ(1 + s -b)\nΓ(s)Γ(1 + s -c)\na0\nThus the general solution is\ny=C1x-a Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n+a)Γ(n+1+a-c)\nn!Γ(n+1+a-b)\nx-n+C2x-b Pinf\nn=0\nΓ(n+b)Γ(n+1+b-c)\nn!Γ(n+1+b-a)\nx-n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants. Note that those series are convergent for\n|x| > 1.\n(c) Since x = infis an irregular singular point of rank 3, we seek a coordinate transformation\nof the form\ny = eA1x3+A2x2+A3xY\nwhich will transform the ODE into a form in which the coeefficent of Y does not have a\npole of order higher than (k+2) = 5. In other words, after transformation the quantity\nt4d(1\nt) should not have a pole of order higher than 5, which means d(1\nt) should not\nhave any poles of order higher than 1 at t = 0. The ODE for Y is\n[(D + 3x2A1 + 2xA2 + A3)2 -x4 + 3\n16x-2]Y = 0\n⇒\n{D2+[6x2A1+4xA2+2A3]D+[(9A2\n1-1)x4+12A1A2x3+(3A1A3+4A2\n2)x2+(4A2A3+6A1)x+(A2\n3+2A2)+\nWe see that we need to do is to eliminate the x4, x3, x2 terms in the coeefficient of Y.\nThis can easily be done by letting 9A2\n1 -1 = 0, A2 = A3 = 0. Hence there are two\ncases, namely A1 = ±1\n3.\nLet's first analyze A1 = 1\n3. Then indeed the ODE becomes\n[D2 + 2x2D + 2x + 3\n16x-2]Y = 0\nwhich has d(1\nt) = 21\nt + 3\n16t2. This last quantity has no poles of order higher than 1,\nverifying our earlier remark.\nNow we proceed as in the earlier cases, thus we plug (2) into the ODE. This gives us\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + s)(n + s + 1) + 3\n16]\n|\n{z\n}\n(n+s+ 1\n4)(n+s+ 3\n4)\nanx-n-s-2 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[-2(n + s) + 2]anx-n-s+1 = 0\n\nMaking n →n -3 in the first summation, we obtain\n2(n + s -1)an + (n -3 + s + 1\n4)(n -3 + s + 3\n4)an-3 = 0\nLetting n = 0 gives that s = 1. Using this, we rewrite the above formula with n = 3m,\nwe obtain\na3m = 3(m -7\n12)(m -5\n12)\n2m\na3(m-1)\nThus the one of the solutions which is valid for |x| >> 1 is\ny1(x)=x-1e\n3x3 Pinf\nn=0(3\n2)n Γ(n+ 5\n12)Γ(n+ 7\n12)\nn!\nx-3n\nFor the case when we take A1 = -1\n3, our ODE is\n[D2 -2x2D -2x + 3\n16x-2]Y = 0\nPlugging in (2) into the ODE. This gives us\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + s)(n + s + 1) + 3\n16]\n|\n{z\n}\n(n+s+ 1\n4)(n+s+ 3\n4)\nanx-n-s-2 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[2(n + s) -2]anx-n-s+1 = 0\nMaking n →n -3 in the first summation, we obtain\n2(n + s -1)an + (n -3 + s + 1\n4)(n -3 + s + 3\n4)an-3 = 0\nLetting n = 0 gives that s = 1. Using this and rewriting the above formula with\nn = 3m, we obtain\na3m = -3(m -7\n12)(m -5\n12)\n2m\na3(m-1)\nThus the second solution which is valid for |x| >> 1 is\ny2(x)=x-1e-1\n3x3 Pinf\nn=0(-3\n2)n Γ(n+ 5\n12)Γ(n+ 7\n12)\nn!\nx-3n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of those two solutions. Note that both\nseries are convergent nowhere.\n(d) Since x = infis an irregular singular point of rank 2, we seek a coordinate trans-\nformation of the form\ny = eA1x2+A2xY\nwhich will transform the ODE into a form in which the coeefficent of Y does not\nhave a pole of order higher than (k + 2) = 4. In other words, after transformation\nthe quantity\nt4d(1\nt) should not have a pole of order higher than 4, which means\nd(1\nt) should not have any poles at t = 0. The ODE for Y is\n[(D + 2xA1 + A2)2 + x2 + 3\n16x-2]Y = 0\n\nor\n[D2 + 4xA1D + 2A1 + 4x2A2\n1 + 4xA1A2 + A2\n2 + x2 + 3\n16x-2]Y = 0\nWe need to do is to eliminate the x2 and x terms in the coefficient of Y. This can\neasily be done by letting 4A2\n1 + 1 = 0, A2 = 0. Let's choose A1 = ±1\n2i, A2 = 0.\nThen indeed the ODE becomes\n[D2 ± 2xiD ± i + 3\n16x-2]Y = 0\nwhich has d(1\nt) = ±i + 3\n16t2. This last quantity has no poles, as we wished.\nNow we proceed as in the earlier cases, thus we plug (2) into the ODE. This gives us\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[(n + s)(n + s + 1) + 3\n16]anx-n-s-2 ± i\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[-2(n + s) + 1]anx-n-s = 0\nMaking n →n -2 in the first summation, we obtain\n±ian(-2(n + s) + 1) + (n -2 + s + 1\n4)(n -2 + s + 3\n4)an-2 = 0\nLetting n = 0 gives that s = 1\n2 (in both cases). Rewriting the above formula, we have\nan = ±i(n -5\n4)(n -3\n4)\n2n\nan-2\nWith n = 2m, the above formula is\na2m = ±i(m -5\n8)(m -3\n8)\nm\na2(m-1)\nThus the general solution which is valid for |x| >> 1 is\ny = C1x-1\n2e\n2ix2\ninf\nX\nn=0\n(i)-nΓ(n + 3\n8)Γ(n + 5\n8)\nn!\nx-2n+C2x-1\n2e-1\n2ix2\ninf\nX\nn=0\n(i)nΓ(n + 3\n8)Γ(n + 5\n8)\nn!\nx-2n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants. The second solution can also be obtained\nby taking the complex conjugate of the first solution. Note that both series converge\nnowhere.\n(e) Since x = infis an irregular singular point of rank 2, we seek a coordinate transformation\nof the form\ny = eA1x2+A2xY\nwhich will transform the ODE into a form in which the coeefficent of Y does not have a\npole of order higher than (k+2) = 4. In other words, after transformation the quantity\nt4d(1\nt) should not have a pole of order higher than 4, which means d(1\nt) should not\nhave any poles at t = 0. The ODE for Y is\n[(D + 2xA1 + A2)2 + ν + 1\n2 -1\n4x2]Y = 0\n\nor\n[D2 + 4xA1D + 2A1 + 4x2A2\n1 + 4xA1A2 + A2\n2 -1\n4x2]Y = 0\nWe see that the only thing we need to do is to eliminate the x2 and x terms in the\ncoefficient of Y. This can easily be done by letting 4A2\n1 -1\n4 = 0, A2 = 0.\nLet's proceed with A1 = ±1\n4. Then indeed the ODE becomes\n[D2 ± xD + ν + 1\n2 ± 1\n2]Y = 0\nwhich has d(1\nt) = ν + 1\n2 ± 1\n2. This last quantity has no poles, as we wished.\nNow we proceed as in the earlier cases, thus we plug (2) into the ODE. This gives us\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n(n + s)(n + s + 1)anx-n-s-2 +\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\n[∓(n + s) + ν + 1\n2 ± 1\n2]anx-n-s = 0\nMaking n →n -2 in the first summation, we obtain\n(∓(n + s) + ν + 1\n2 ± 1\n2)an + (n -2 + s)(n -1 + s)an-2 = 0\nLetting n = 0, we find that s = ±ν + 1\n2 ± 1\n2 . Rewriting the above formula\nan = -(n -2 + s)(n -1 + s)\n∓(n + s) + ν + 1\n2 ± 1\nan-2\nWith n = 2m, the above formula is\na2m = -(2m -2 + s)(2m -1 + s)\n∓(2m + s) + ν + 1\n2 ± 1\na2(m-1) = -2\n(m + s-2\n2 )(m + s-1\n2 )\n[∓m + 1\n2(∓s + ν + 1\n2 ± 1\n2)]a2(m-1)\nHence for upper (+) case: s = ν + 1, and\na2m = 2(m + ν-1\n2 )(m + ν\n2)\nm\na2(m-1) = 2mΓ(m + ν+1\n2 )Γ(m + ν+2\n2 )\nm!Γ(ν-1\n2 )Γ(ν\n2)\na0\nand for the lower (-) case: s = -ν, and\na2m = -2(m -ν+2\n2 )(m -ν+1\n2 )\nm + 1\na2(m-1) = (-2)mΓ(m -ν\n2)Γ(m -ν-1\n2 )Γ(1\n2)\nΓ(m + 3\n2)Γ(-ν\n2)Γ(-ν+1\n) a0\nThus the general solution which is valid for |x| >> 1 is\ny = C1e\n4x2x-ν-1\ninf\nX\nn=0\n2nΓ(n + ν+1\n2 )Γ(n + ν+2\n2 )\nn!\nx-2n+C2e-1\n4x2xν\ninf\nX\nn=0\n(-2)nΓ(n -ν\n2)Γ(n -ν-1\n2 )\nn!\nx-2n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants.

(Chapter 7,Problem 1) Show that the Wronskian of y+\nWKB and y-\nWKB given by\n(7.5) is a constant.\nSolution:\nThe Wronskian is defined to be\nW = y1y0\n2 -y0\n1y2\nwhere, in our case,\ny1\n=\ny+\nWKB =\np\np(x)\nei R p(x)dx\n(3)\ny2\n=\ny-\nWKB =\np\np(x)\ne-i R p(x)dx\nWe differentiate those to find\n(y±\nWKB)0 = [±ip(x) -\n2p(x)]y±\nWKB\nThus\nW\n=\ny+\nWKBy-\nWKB[-ip(x) -\n2p(x)] -[ip(x) -\n2p(x)]y+\nWKBy-\nWKB\n=\n-2ip(x)y+\nWKBy-\nWKB\n=\n-2ip(x)\np\np(x)\nei R p(x)dx\np\np(x)\ne-i R p(x)dx = -2i = constant\n3. The WKB solutions (3) can also be derived by putting\ny = eiS\n(a) Substitute WKB solutions into y00 + p2y = 0 and show that\niS00 -(S0)2 + p2 = 0\nwhich is a nonlinear ODE.\n(b) If p(x) is of the form\np(x) = λP(x)\ngive a reason which suggests that we may drop the term iS00 in the equation\nabove and obtain\n(S0)2 -p2 = 0\nThis equation is known as Hamilton-Jacobi equation.\n(c) Show that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation yields the solutions e±i R p(x)dx.\n(d) Obtain the additional factor\n√\np(x) in the WKB solutions by going to the\nnext-order approximation.\nSolution:\n\n(a)\ny\n=\neiS\ny0\n=\niS0eiS\ny00\n=\niS00eiS -(S0)2eiS\nPlugging those in, we obtain\niS00eiS -(S0)2eiS + p2eiS = [iS00 -(S0)2 + p2]eiS = 0\nHence, if y 6= 0,\niS00 -(S0)2 + p2 = 0\n(4)\n(b) We don't know what S is, in the first place. So how can one show that the term iS00\ncan be dropped, that is, it is negligible.The strategy is that we neglect the term iS00,\nand solve for S. After then, we turn back, and check if we did something sensible with\nneglecting iS00.\nSolving\n(S0)2 -λ2P 2 = 0\nwe obtain\nS = ±λ\nZ\nP(x)dx = O(λ)\n(5)\nHence\nS0\n=\nλP(x)\nS00\n=\nλP 0(x)\nThus\nλ(i1\nλS)00\n|\n{z\n}\nO( 1\nλ )\n-(1\nλS0)2\n| {z }\nO(1)\n+ P 2\n|{z}\nO(1)\n= 0\nHence, the solution S given by (5) almost satisfies the given equation. So the term iS00\nis negligible-compared with (S0)2.\n(c) Putting (5) into y = eiS, we obtian y = e±i R p(x)dx.\n(d) Let\nS = ±λ\nZ\nP(x)dx + Q(x)\nwhere Q(x) is the next-order correction to S.Then\nS0\n=\n±λP(x) + Q0(x)\nS00\n=\n±λP 0(x) + Q00(x)\nPlugging those into (4), we obtain\n-λP 0 -λ2P 2 -2iλPQ0 + (Q0)2 + λ2P 2 = 0\n\nor\nP 0 + 2iPQ0 = 1\nλ(Q0)2\nNeglecting the right-hand side of the last equation, we obtain\nQ0 = i1\nP 0\nP\nThis integrates to give us\nQ = i ln P\nThus\ny\n=\neiS = ei[±λ R P(x)dx+Q(x)]\n=\ne±i R p(x)dx-1\n2 ln p\n=\np\np(x)\ne±i R p(x)dx\nQ.E.D."

Solve approximately the following two equations\n(a) 2y00 + (1 + x)2y0 + y = 0, 0 < x < 1, with y(0) = 0 and y(1) = 2.\n(b) 2y00 -(1 + x2)y0 + y = 0, 0 < x < 1, with y(0) = 0 and y(1) = 2\nSolutions:\n1. Solve approximately the following two equations\nIn both problems, the highest derivative is multiplied by a perturbation parameter 2,\nand hence the problems are solved using boundary layer techniques.\n(a) Since a(x) = (1 + x)2 > 0, the rapidly varying solution is decreasing and thus the\nboundary layer is at x = 0, and it has width 2.\nWe can find the solution outside the boundary layer by solving\n(1 + x)2y0\nout + yout = 0\nwhich gives\nyout = C1e\n1+x\nwhere C1 is a constant. Since the rapidly varying function is negligible at x = 1, we can use\nthe boundary condition at x = 0 to determine the value of C1 :\nyout(1) = C1e1/2 = 2\nthus C1 = 2e-1/2. To find the behaviour of the rapidly varying function near x = 0, we look\nat\n2y00 + (1 + 0)2y0 = 0\nwhich gives\nyr ≈C2e-x/2\nUsing the boundary condition at x = 0, i.e\nC2 + yout(0) = 0\nwe find C2 = -2e-1/2. Hence the solution is\nyuniform = 2e-1/2e\n1+x -2e-1/2e-x/2\n1. (b) Since a(x) = -(1 + x2) < 0, the rapidly varying solution is increasing and thus\nthe boundary layer is at x = 1, and it has width 2.\n\nWe can find the solution outside the boundary layer by solving\n-(1 + x2)y0\nout + yout = 0\nwhich gives\nyout = C1etan-1 x\nwhere C1 is a constant. Since the rapidly varying function is negligible at x = 0, we can use\nthe boundary condition at x = 0 to determine the value of C1 :\nyout(0) = C1e0 = 0\nthus C1 = 0. Hence yout ≡0.Therefore the solution is approximately zero outside the bound-\nary layer.\nTo find the behaviour of the rapidly varying function near x = 1, we look at\n2y00 -(1 + 12)y0 = 0\nwhich gives\nyr ≈C2e2(x-1)/2\nUsing the boundary condition at x = 1, we find C2 = 2. Hence one may think that the\nsolution can be approximated by\nyuniform = yr + yout = yr = 2e2(x-1)/2\n(1)\nThat is correct in that the absolute error between the exact solution and yuniform given by\n(1) will be small. But since the solution itself is also \"small\", the relative error may be large.\nIn such a case, it may be useful to calculate higher order approximations to yr which, in the\npresent case, equals yuniform.\nTo calculate a better approximation, we let\nyr = e\nR x\n1 (1+x2)dxv(x) = e\n2 (x+ 1\n3x3-4\n3)dxv(x)\nwhere v(x) is expected not to be rapidly varying. Substituting this into the differential\nequation, we obtain\nv0 -2x + 1\n1 + x2 v = 2v00\nNeglecting the right hand side, we find\nln v = -ln(1 + x2) -tan-1 x + c\nor\nv(x) =\n2C\n1 + x2e-(tan-1 x-π\n4 )\nwhere c and C are some constants. Using the boundary condition at x = 1, we see that\nC = 2. Hence we find\nyuniform = yout + yr = yr =\n1 + x2e-(tan-1 x-π\n4 )e\n2 (x+ 1\n3x3-4\n3)dx\nwhich is more accurate than (1)."

Solve approximately\n2y00 + (1 + x2)y0 + y = 0, 0 < x < 1, 2 << 1\n(1)\nwith boundary conditions\ny(0) = y(1) = 1\n(2)\n2. Solve approximately\n2y00 + x(1 + x)y0 + 1\n2y = 0, 0 < x < 1, 2 << 1\n(3)\nwith boundary conditions\ny(0) = 1 and y(1) = 2\n(4)\n3. Solve approximately\n2y00 -2xy0 + (1 + 3x3)y = 0, -1 < x < 1, 2 << 1\n(5)\nwith boundary conditions\ny(-1) = 2 and y(1) = 3\n(6)\nSolutions:\n1. Since a(x) = -2 sin x ≤0, the rapidly varying solution is increasing with x. Thus there\nis a boundary layer of width 2 near the endpoint x = 1. Also, since a(x) has a simple\nzero at x = 0, there is a boundary layer of width √2 near the endpoint x = 0.\nWe start by seeking the solution yin(x) valid inside the boundary layer near x = 0.\nThis is because yr(x) is negligible in this region. Thus the solution in this region has\nonly one arbitrary constant which can be determined from the boundary condition at\nx = 0.\nThe solution inside the boundary layer near x = 0 is a linear combination of the\nsolutions given by\ny± = e-αx2/42Dν(±\nr\n|α|\n2 x)\n(7)\nwhere\nν = β\n|α| -sign(α) + 1\n(8)\n\nwhere β = cos(x)|x=0 = 1, and α = a0(x)|x=0 = -2 cos 0 = -2. Thus ν = 1/2, and the\nsolutions are\ny± = e-x2/22D1/2(±\nr\n2x)\n(9)\nThe solution y-is the rapidly increasing solution which is negligible inside the boundary\nlayer near x = 0. Thus we have\ny(near 0)\nin\n(x) = ex2/22D1/2(\nr\n2x)\nD1/2(0)\n(10)\nwhere the boundary conditon y(0) = 1 has been utilized. Remembering that\nDν(X) ≈Xνe-X2/4, X →inf\n(11)\nfor x >> √2, we conclude\ny(near 0)\nin\n(x) ≈\nD1/2(0)(\nr\n2x)1/2\n(12)\nOutside the boundary layers, we have\n-2(sin x)y0 + (cos x)y = 0\n(13)\nwhich gives\nyout(x) = c\n√\nsin x\n(14)\nMatching yout with yin in the region 1 >> x >> √2, we obtain c =\nD1/2(0)(2\n2)1/4. Thus\nyout(x) =\nD1/2(0)(2\n2)1/4√\nsin x\n(15)\nIn particular, yout(1) =\nD1/2(0)(2\n2)1/4√\nsin 1.\nFinally, we seek the the solution inside the boundary layer near x = 1. Since a(1) =\n-2 sin 1, we have\nyr(x) = [1 -yout(1)]e-2 sin 1(1-x)/2\n(16)\nThus we have\ny(near 1)\nin\n(x) =\nD1/2(0)(2\n2)1/4√\nsin 1 + [1 -\nD1/2(0)(2\n2)1/4√\nsin 1]e-2 sin 1(1-x)/2\n(17)\n2. Since a(x) = x(1 + x) ≥0, the rapidly varying solution is a decreasing function of x,\nhence there is a boundary layer near x = 0. Since a(0) = 0, which means that x = 0 is\na turning point, the width of the boundary layer near x = 0 is of order √2.\nThe rapidly varying solution yr is negligible outside the boundary layer. Thus when\nx >> √2, the solution is approximately equal to yout which satisfies\nx(1 + x)y0\nout + 1\n2yout = 0\n(18)\n\nThis equation yields yout(x) = c\nq\nx+1\nx where c is a constant. Making use of the boundary\ncondition at x = 1, we find\nyout(x) =\nr\n2(x + 1)\nx\n(19)\nInside the boundary layer near x = 0, using the formulae given in the solution of\nproblem 1,with α = 1, β = 1/2, ν = -1/2, we find\nyin(x) = e-x2/42[c1D-1/2(\nr\n2x) + c2D-1/2(-\nr\n2x)]\n(20)\nwhere both c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.We eliminate one of those constants by\nmatching the solutions yin and yout in the region 1 >> x >> √2,that is, by observing\nyin(x) ≈e-x2/42c2D-1/2(-\nr\n2x) ≈c2\n√\n2π\nΓ(1/2)(\nr\n2x)-1/2 = c2\n√\n2(\nr\n2x)-1/2\n(21)\nby virtue of the formula\nDν(X) ≈\n√\n2π\nΓ(-ν)|X|-ν-1eX2/4, X →inf\n(22)\nThis is because the first summand, c1D-1/2(-\nq\n2x), vanishes as x >> √2, which can\nbe seen from (11).Also\nyout(x) ≈\nr\nx\n(23)\nin the region 1 >> x >> √2. We note that both yin and yout are equal to a constant\ntimes x-1/2 in the region 1 >> x >> √2. This is an indication that this region is the\noverlapping region in which both approximations hold. Joining yin and yout in this\noverlapping region gives us\nc2 = (1\n2)1/4\n(24)\nFrom the boundary condition at x = 0, we know c1 + c2 = 1/D-1/2(0), hence c1 =\n1/D-1/2(0) -(1\n2)1/4. Therefore\nyin(x) = e-x2/42[(\nD-1/2(0) -(1\n2)1/4)D-1/2(\nr\n2x) + (1\n2)1/4D-1/2(-\nr\n2x)]\n(25)\nAs a final observation, we note that yout(0) is infinite. But as we continue yout(x) into\nthe region of the boundary layer, it turns into\n(1\n2)1/4e-x2/42D-1/2(-\nr\n2x)\n(26)\nAt x = 0, the expression above is equal to (1\n2)1/4D-1/2(0), which is a large number but\nnot infinity.\n\n3. We observe that, since a(0) = 0, there is turning point at x = 0, which is an interior\npoint. Hence there is a boundary layer of width order √2 near x = 0. In this case,\nwe know that the roles of the slowly varying solution and the rapidly varying solution\ninterchange as one crosses the turning point x = 0.\nBy the terminology of the notes and the book, we have α = -2. Thus the negligible\nsolution is the slowly varying solution, and the (possibly) order 1 solution is the rapidly\nvarying solution.\nAlso, the rapidly varying solution is increasing for x > 0. Therefore, there is a boundary\nlayer of width 2 near x = 1. Similarly, since the rapidly varying solution is decreasing\nfor x < 0, there is a boundary layer of width of order 2 near x = -1.(This is always\nthe case if α < 0, and there are no other turning points)\nLet us start with the slowly varying solution at x = -1. Since this solution becomes\nthe rapidly varying solution in the region x > 0, and since the value of the solution at\nx = 1 is of order unity, this solution must be exponentially small outside the boundary\nlayer near x = 1.\nSimilarly if we start with the slowly varying solution at x = 1, and continue it to\nnegative values of x, it becomes the rapidly varying solution in the region x < 0. Thus\nthis solution must be exponentially small outside of the boundary layer at x = -1.\nThe solution of the problem is the sum of the two solutions described above. It is\nappreciable only near the endpoints. Near x = 1, we have a(x) = -2, thus for x > 0\nyin1(x) ≈3e-2(1-x)/2\n(27)\nSimilarly, for x < 0\nyin2(x) ≈2e-2(x+1)/2\n(28)\nwhere the boundary conditions are utilized. Finally, we can write\nyuniform(x) = 3e-2(1-x)/2 + 2e-2(x+1)/2\n(29)"

This is because,\n\nwhen η is integrated, a term of O( 1\nx) will give a logarithmic function, and in the WKB\nsolution this will show up as a factor in front. Smaller terms, however, will not matter.\nFor example\nx2 in η will integrate to -1\nx, which will contribute a factor exp(-1\nx). As\nx >> 1, this factor will be very close to 1, hence negligible.

Find the entire asymptotic series for each of the integrals in problem 2.\nSolutions:\nIn the following, we assume the given integrals to be in the form\nI(λ) =\nZ b\na\nh(x)e-λv(x)dx\n1. (a) v(x) = x3, which has a minimum at the lower end point -1. Since v(x) is monoton-\nically increasing in [-1, 1], we can use the formula\nI(λ) ≈e-λv(a)h(a)\nλv0(a)\n(1)\nto obtain the leading term as\nI(λ) ≈2eλ\n3λ\n\n(b) The integral can be written as\nI(λ)\n=\nZ inf\nt1/2e-λ cosh(t+1)dt\n=\nZ inf\nt1/2e-λ[cosh 1+t sinh 1+..]dt\n≈\ne-λ cosh 1\nZ inf\nt1/2e-λt sinh 1dt\n=\ne-λ cosh 1\nZ inf\n(\nλ sinh 1)3/2s1/2e-sds\n=\ne-λ cosh 1\n(λ sinh 1)3/2Γ(3/2) =\ne-λ cosh 1\n(λ sinh 1)3/2\n√π\n(c) v(x) = -x(1 -x) takes its minimum at x = 1/2, which is an interior point.\nAs v00(1/2) 6= 0, we can use the formula\nI(λ) ≈\ns\n2π\nλ|v00(x0)|e-λv(x0)h(x0)\n(2)\nto obtain the leading term\nI(λ) ≈\nrπ\nλeλ/4\n2. (a) v(x) = x3, which takes its minimum at x = -1. So, by using (1), we find\nI(λ) ≈eλ\n3λ\n(b) v(x) = x2, takes its minimum at x = 1. Therefore, using (1), we find\nI(λ) ≈e-λ\n2λ\n(c)\nZ 1\n-2\n(sin x)e-λx2dx =\nZ -1\n-2\n(sin x)e-λx2dx +\nZ 1\n-1\n(sin x)e-λx2dx\nwhere the second integral is zero, because its integrand is odd. Therefore, we only\nconsider the first integral. v(x) = x2, which takes its minimum at x = -1 and is\nmonotonically decreasing throughout [-2, -1]. Therefore, by using the formula\nI(λ) ≈-e-λv(b)h(b)\nλv0(b)\n(3)\nto obtain the leading term as\nI(λ) ≈-e-λ\n2λ sin 1\n\n(d) v(x) = sin x takes its minimum at x = -π\n2, an interior point. Therefore, the\nformula (2) gives the leading term\nr\n2π\nλ eλ\n(e) h(x) = e-x2 and v(x) = x, which takes its minimum at x = 0 and is monotonic\nthroughout the domain of integration.\nTherefore, the relevant formula is (3),\nwhich gives\nI(λ) ≈1\nλ\n(f) Since the main contribution comes from x = λ part, we can replace the integral\nby\nI(λ)\n=\nZ λ\nex3dx\n=\nZ λ\n3x23x2ex3dx =\n3x2ex3|λ\n1 +\nZ λ\n3x3ex3dx\nwhich implies the leading term\n3λ2eλ3\n(g) v(x) = x+x5, which takes on its minimum at x = 0, therefore by using the formula\n(3), we obtain\nλ\n3. (a) We first let s = x3 + 1, then the integral becomes\nI(λ) = eλ\nZ 2\ne-λs1\n3(1 -s)2/3dx\nwhere now the contribution comes from s = 0. So we can change the upper limit\nto inf.

Find the leading term for each of the integrals below for λ >> 1.\n(a)\nR 1\n-1 eiλt3dt\n(b)\nR inf\n1 eiλt2dt\n(c)\nR π\n0 eiλ cos tdt\n2. Find the leading term for each of the integrals below λ >> 1.\nI(x) =\nZ inf\n-inf\neixteit5/5dt\n(1)\nConsider both cases in which x > 0 or x < 0.\nSolutions:\n1. (a) I(λ) = R 1\n-1 eiλt3dt\nCan write\nI(λ) =\nZ 1\neiλt3dt +\nZ 0\n-1\neiλt3dt\nWe observe that the second integral is the complex conjugate of the first, hence\nI(λ) = 2 Re\nZ 1\neiλt3dt\nMoreover, we see that the point t = 0 is the only stationary phase point, which gives the\nmain contribution to the integral, therefore we can make the approximation\nI(λ) ≈2 Re\nZ inf\neiλt3dt = 2 Re J(λ)\nwhere\nJ(λ) =\nZ inf\neiλt3dt\nNote that we do not need to calculate the end point contributions, which would come out to\nbe of smalller order than the contribution of the stationary phase point-we are only asked\nthe leading term.\nThe integrand of J is oscillatory. We would like to change the contour into one on which is\nexponentially decreasing, for then we we would be able to express it as a gamma function.\nThus we put\nz3 = it3\nwhere t is real. This means the path over which the integral is taken would be\nz = i1/3t\n\nThere are three roots for i1/3 : eiπ/6, e5iπ/6, e3iπ/2. An analysis of those paths brings that we\ncan only change the domain of integral, which is originally the real axis, into the straightline\nmaking an angle π/6, which is the only case where we can close our contour with a zero\ncontribution arc. Thus\nJ = eiπ/6\nZ inf\ne-λt3dt\nMaking one more variable change\nτ = λt3\nwe arrive at\nJ = eiπ/6\n3λ1/3\nZ inf\ne-ττ -2/3dτ = eiπ/6\n3λ1/3Γ(1/3)\nTherefore, the answer is given by\nI(λ) ≈\n3λ1/3Γ(1/3)\n1. (b)\nR inf\n1 eiλx2dx\nThere is no stationary phase points in the domain of the integral, hence this is an integral\nin the form (8.36) of the book, i.e of the form\nI(λ) =\nZ b\na\neiλu(x)h(x)dx\n(2)\nfor which the end point contributions are important. Hence the leading form can be given\nby (8.39) in the book, which is\neiλu(b)h(b)\niλu0(b)\n-eiλu(a)h(a)\niλu0(a)\nIn our case, we have only one end point, hence the leading term is\n-eiλu(1)h(1)\niλu0(1)\n= -eiλ\n2iλ\n1. (c)\nR π\n0 eiλ cos xdx\nThe stationary phase points are solutions to sin x = 0, which are x = 0, π. Since stationary\nphase points contribute more than the end points, we do not consider end points for the\npurpose of calculating the leading term.\nIn this example, the end points are stationary\nphase points, so they will already be taken care of when calculating the stationary phase\npoints, so in some sense, we can say that there is no end point contribution.\nWe use the formula (8.45) and (8.46) from the book which are\neiπ/4\ns\n2π\nλu00(x0)eiλu(x0)h(x0) and e-iπ/4\ns\n2π\nλ|u00(x0)|eiλu(x0)h(x0)\n(3)\n\ndepending on the sign of u00(x0). Since the stationary phase points are end points, they\ncontribute only half of the quantity they would if they were interior points. Thus we finally\nfind\n2e-iπ/4\nr\n2π\nλ eiλ + 1\n2eiπ/4\nr\n2π\nλ e-iλ =\nr\n2π\nλ cos(λ -π\n4)\nas the leading term.\n2. The integral (1) is in the form (2), with u(t) = t, h(t) = eit5/5. The integral has neither\npoints of stationary phase nor finite end points. We first treat the simpler case x < 0.\nWe start with scaling the variable of integration by the transformation t = (-x)1/4z,\nand the integral (1) becomes\nI(x) = (-x)1/4\nZ inf\n-inf\neiΛf(z)dz\nwith f(z) = -z + 1\n5z5 and Λ = (-x)5/4. This last integrand has two stationary points\nz = -1, 1, which are found by solving f 0(z) = -1 + z4 = 0. Therefore the integral can\nbe approximated by making use of (3), which give\ne-iπ/4\nr π\n2Λe4iΛ/5 + eiπ/4\nrπ\n2e-4iΛ/5\ntherefore\nI(x)\n=\n(-x)1/4\nr\n2π\nΛ cos(4\n5Λ -π\n4)\n=\n(-x)1/4\ns\n2π\n(-x)5/4 cos(4\n5(-x)5/4 -π\n4) =\n√\n2π(-x)-3/8 cos(4\n5(-x)5/4 -π\n4)\nFor the case x > 0, we scale the original integral with t = x1/4z, and the integral (1)\nbecomes\nI(x) = x1/4\nZ inf\n-inf\neiΛf(z)dz\n(4)\nwith f(z) = z + 1\n5z5 and Λ = x5/4. This integral still does not have any stationary\nphase points, hence we look at the critical points of f by solving f 0(z) = 1 + z4 = 0\nwhich gives z = eiπ/4, e3iπ/4, e5iπ/4, e7iπ/4.\nPutting z = reiθ in f(z) = z + 1\n5z5 = r(cos θ + i sin θ) + 1\n5r5(cos 5θ + i sin 5θ). So the\nintegrand of (4) blows up for large r in the regions where\n-sin 5θ > 0\nand becomes exponentially small in the regions where sin 5θ > 0. These are shown in\nthe figure below along with the critical points of f. The regions in which the integrand\nbecomes exponentially large are shaded. We observe that we can deform the domain\nof our integral as shown in the figure, to upwards, so that the path of the integral\nnow contains two of the critical points of f. We cannot deform the path of our integral\n\nFigure 1\n\ndownwards, as the \"black\" regions, over which the integrand becomes exponentially\nlarge prevents us from doing so.\nWe calculate the relevant values\nf(eiπ/4)\n=\n5eiπ/4, f 00(eiπ/4) = 4e3iπ/4\nf(e3iπ/4)\n=\n5e3iπ/4, f 00(e3iπ/4) = 4eiπ/4\nwhich means we have the expansions\niΛf(z)\n≈\niΛ4\n5eiπ/4 -2Λeiπ/4(z -eiπ/4)2\niΛf(z)\n≈\niΛ4\n5e3iπ/4 -2Λe-iπ/4(z -e3iπ/4)2\nSo the contributions from those critical points are calculated to be\nx1/4\nr\nπ\n2Λeiπ/4 exp[iΛ4\n5eiπ/4] + x1/4\nr\nπ\n2Λe-iπ/4 exp[iΛ4\n5e3iπ/4]\nwhich is\n√\n2πx-3/8√\n2π exp(-2\n√\n5 x5/4) cos(2\n√\n5 x5/4 -1\n8π)"

Since the integrand has no finite endpoints nor points of stationary phase, the dominant\ncontributions to this integral come from point or points in the complex plane. Since the integrand is\nof the order of unity, we expect that the integral vanishes exponentially as R i K.\nAs the integrand has no singularities, the dominant contributions come from one or more saddle\npoints in the complex plane. Let\nfΩzæ : sinh z.\nThe saddle points are the zeroes of\nfrΩzæ : cosh z.\nThus a saddle point z0 satisfies\nez0 + e?z0 : 0,\nwhich can be writeen as\ne2z0\nz\n: ?1.\nTherefore,\n0 : ciZ/2, c3iZ/2, 6 6 6 cΩ2n + 1æZ/2 6 6 6.\nThere are an infinite number of saddle points.\nTo see which one or ones contribute, we evaluate the integrand at each of the saddle points.

The goal is to make the deformed contour pass through one or more of the saddle\npoints, with the magnitude of the integrand largest at the saddle points.\nIn order to jusify the deformation of the contour of integration, we must make sure that the\nintegrand vanishes at the added contour at infinity. Since\nP eiR sinhΩx+iyæ P: e?R cosh x sin y,\nthe integrand vanishes as x i cK provided that sin y ; 0.

This\n/3Ω\nrapidly varying solution joins with the second term for yΩaæΩxæ given above. Thus we have\nB : 0.\nThe boundary condition\nyΩ0æ : 0 A A : 0.\nThus the solution inside the boundary layer near x : 0 is zero.\nMatching youtΩxæ with this solution, we find that\nyoutΩxæ : 0.\n\nNear x : 1, we have\nyΩxæ : e? 3 tan 1Ω1?xæ\nK\n,\nwhich satisfies the boundary condition yΩ1æ : 1.

As we know, the solution of an interior boundary layer with a negative F is generally a\nU-shape curve, being very small everywhere except in regions of widths K near the endpoints.\nIn the present problem, the boundary condition at the upper endpoint is yΩ1æ : 0. Thus the\nsolution is small everywhere except near the lower endpoint.

The equation can be\nwritten as\n66 y +c2y : ?K y\n6 2 y ? c2Ωa1K + a2K2 + 6 6 6æy.\nThe last term in the differential equation above is the counter term.

Thus y0 is a linear\n6 2\nsuperposition of eimct terms with real coefficients. Similarly, all eimct coefficients of y0 y0 are\nimaginary.\nThe differential equation for y1 is\nΩ d2 + c2æy1 : i e3ict ? e?3ict + eict ? e?ict + ca1i eict ?\ne?ict .\ndt2\n8c\nSetting the sum of the coefficients of eict in the equation above to zero. we get\na1 : ? 4c2 .\nWe see that the sum of the e?ict coefficients also vanishes with this choice of a1.\nThat a single choice of a1 eliminates two kinds of secular terms is due to the fact that a1is real.\n\nWith a1 real, the right-side of the differential equation above is real. This ensures that the sum of the\ncoefficients of e?ict terms is equal to the complex conjugate of that of the eict terms. Consequently,\nthe sum of the e?ict coefficients vanishes if that of the eict coefficients does.\nWith this value of a1, we get\nc : 1 + K + 6 6 6,\nand\nsinΩ1 + K æt\ny0Ωtæ :\n1 + K 8\n,\nwhich, in the lowest-order of K and with t as large as K?1, agrees with the result obtained earlier\nwith the two-scale method.\nThe eimct coefficients of y1Ωtæ are imaginary. To see this, we solve the differential equation\nsatisfied by y1Ωtæ and get\ny1Ωtæ : Beict + BDe?ict + e3ict ? e?3ict .\ny\n64c3i\nThe initial condition of y1Ω0æ : 0 leads to B being purely imaginary. From the initial condition\n1 Ω0æ : 0, we find that the value of B is 3i/Ω64c3æ. Thus\ny1Ωtæ : i 3eict ? 3e?ict ? e3ict + e?3ict\n64c3\n.\nWe note that all coefficients of the eimct terms in the expression above are imaginary. This, in\nturn, enables us to show that the secular terms in the differential equation for y2Ωtæ can be eliminated\nby a choice of a2.\nInstead of showing this, we shall, instead, show by induction that the secular terms in the\ndifferential equation for yn+1 can be eliminated by the counter terms, where n : 2, 3 6 6 6.\ne\nLet ylΩtæ, l : 0, 1 6 6 6 n, be a superposition of eimct terms with imaginary coefficients. Then the\nimct coefficients of y\nlΩtæ, l : 0, 1 6 6 6 n are real. With the same arguments as presented before, we\nmay show that it is possible to eliminate both the eict secular terms and the e?ict secular terms in the\ndifferential equation for yn+1Ωtæ with a single choice of an. Also, since yn+1Ω0æ : 0, the eimct\ncoefficients of yn+1Ωtæ are imaginary. Thus we have proven by induction that it is possible to\neliminate all secular terms with the counter terms."

      "content": "Boundary Layers and Singular Perturbation\nLecture 18\nInterior Turning Points\nIn this lecture we'll examine some examples in which there is a turning point inside the interval\nwhere (9.13) holds. This is to say that the turning point is an interior point.\nThis is a good time to make a subtle elaboration on how to continue a solution through a turning\npoints. We shall put, without loss of generality, the turning point at the origin.\nLet's first consider the case in which F ; 0. The rapidly varying solution is increasing for x 9 0\nand is decreasing for x ; 0. Let us start with the rapidly varying solution (9.24), at the lower\nendpoint x : ?1 and continue this solution to the right. Before we reach the origin, indeed at a\njoin it with y2Ωxæ which, by the second asymptotic form of (9.52), is\nK\ndistance\naway from the origin, (9.24) fails to be a good approximation. To continue this solution\nthrough the origin, we must\nx\nK\nx\nx o\nrapidly varying when is negative and is with a magnitude much larger than\n. As we continue this\nsolution to positive values of , it turns into the slowly varying solution when\nK\nF ;\n, as can be\nverified with the use of the first asymptotic formula of (9.52). We mention that, for\n0, it is not\nmeaningful to start with the slowly varying solution at x : ?1 and continue it to the right. To see\nthis, consider the solution near x : ?1 which is a sum of a slowly varying solution and a rapidly\nvarying solution. Let the latter being very small compared to the former at x : ?1. As we continue\nthis solution to the right, the rapidly solution grows exponentially and may become comparable to or\neven larger than the slowly varying solution. This says that if we start at x : ?1, it is difficult to\ndistinguish a slowly varying solution with the sum of a slowly varying solution and a rapidly varying\nsolution.\nSimilarly, in order to obtain the second independent solution of the differential equation, we start\nwith the rapidly varying solution at the upper endpoint x : 1 and continue it to the left. Inside the\nboundary layer, it is equal to y1Ωxæ, as we can seen from the first asymptotic formula of (9.51). As\nwe continue this solution to the region x 9 0, it turns into the slowly varying solution, as we can see\nfrom the second asymptotic formula of (9.51).\nTo repeat, if F is positive, the rapidly varying solution decreases exponentially as one leaves the\norigin in either direction. Therefore, if a rapidly varying solution and a slowly varying solution are of\nthe same order of magnitude at x : 0, then the former is much smaller than the latter as one leaves\nthe origin. We shall call the former the small solution, and the latter the large solution. It is\nmeaningful to take a small solution at one side of the turning point and continue it across the turning\npoint. The small solution turns into the large solution at the other side of the turning point. But it is\nnot meaningful to start with the large solution and continue it across the turning point.\nIf F 9 0, the rapidly varying solution is increasing in the region x ; 0 and decreasing in the\nregion x 9 0. Thus the rapidly varying solution is the large solution and the slowly varying solution\nis the small solution. As before, we must start with the small solution and continue it across the\nturning. Thus we start with the slowly varying solution at an endpoint and continue it across the\norigin. This solution turns into the rapidly varying solution as one crosses the origin.\nWe shall give a couple of examples to illustrate how to use this concept of small solution and\nlarge solution to solve a boundary layer problem with an interior turing point. It is also possible to\nuse this concept to solve boundary layer problems with two or more turning points.

This means that\nthere is no boundary layer at the upper endpoint x : 1.

      "content": "The WKB Approximation\nLecture Eleven\nTurning Point\nAs we have mentioned, the WKB approximation is useful in problems of wave propagation. In\nthis section we demonstrate this by applying it to the wave equation which governs the quantum\nmechanical behavior of a particle.\nConsider the time-independent Schrodinger equation of one spatial dimension discussed at the\nend of Chapter 5. We will write this equation in the form\nd2` + R2øE ? VΩxæ¿` : 0,\n(7.50)\ndx2\nR\n2m\nm\nR\nwhere\nis equal to\ndivided by the Planck constant, with\nthe mass of the particle. We shall\nconsider\nas a very large number.\nAs we have mentioned, |`|2 is the probability density of the particle, E is the energy of the\nparticle, and VΩxæ is the potential. We note that E ? V is equal to the kinetic energy of the particle.\nIn the region where\nE ; VΩxæ,\nthe kinetic energy of the particle is positive. Comparing with (7.1), we identify pΩxæ with\nR E ? VΩxæ .\nThe WKB solutions are\np?1/2e\ni X pdx and p?1/2e\n?i X pdx .\n(7.51)\nThese solutions are oscillatory as a function of x.\nIn the region where\nE 9 VΩxæ,\nthe kinetic energy of the particle is negative, and the momentum of the particle is imaginary. In\nclassical mechanics, this region is inaccessible to the particle. The WKB solutions are\nX Ndx\n?X Ndx\nN?1/2e\nand N?1/2e\n,\n(7.52)\nwhere\nN : R VΩxæ ? E .\nThe first solution above is exponentially increasing as x increases, and the second solution above is\nexponentially decreasing as x increases. Since a particle is rarely observed in the classically\ninaccessible region, we require the solution to be the one which decreases more and more as x goes\ndeeper and deeper into the classically inaccessble region.\nLet there be a point x0 at which\nE ? VΩx0æ : 0.\nNote that the point x0 is the point at which the momentum of the particle vanishes. By (7.4), the\nWKB approximation fails at x0. Indeed, (7.4) is not satisfied in a small neighborhood around x0, and\nthe WKB approximation fails in this small neighborhood.\nLet us study the behavior of the wavefunction near x0. We shall assume that the derivative of\nVΩxæ at x0 is different from zero, hence E ? VΩxæ is negative at one side of x0 and positive at the other\nside of x0. The point x0 is the dividing point between a classically accessible region and a classically\ninaccessible region. In classical mechanics, the particle cannot move into the region where its kinetic\nenergy is negative, and must turn back as it arrives at x0. That is why the point x0 is called a turning\npoint of the equation. As we may expect, the qualitative behavior of the quantum wavefunction goes\nthrough a transition near x0. More precisely, the WKB solution changes from an oscillatory behavior\nfrom one side of x0 to an exponential behavior at the other side of x0. However, we cannot continue\nthe solution from one side of x0 to the other side of x0 with the WKB approximation alone. This is\nbecause the WKB solutions fail in a small neighborhood around x0.\nFortunately, another approximation is available when x is close to x0, where we may make the\napproximation\nøE ? VΩxæ¿ u ?FΩx ? x0æ,\nwith F equal to VrΩx0æ. This approximation is valid for\n|x ? x0| o 1.\n(7.53)\n-- 1 --\n\nThe WKB Approximation\nTherefore, in the region of (7.53), the Schrodinger equation is approximately equal to\nd2` ? FR2Ωx ? x0æ` : 0,\n(7.54)\ndx2\nwhich is related to the Air equation\nd2u ? [u : 0\nd[2\nby a linear transformation of the independent variable. Thus the Schrodinger equation in the\nregion near the turning point is approximately a linear superposition of the solutions of the Airy\nfunctions. The constants of superposition are determined by the conditions imposed on the solution.\nBy (7.4), the WKB approximation is valid in the region\no ??2/3,\no ?\n?\n|x ? x0|\n(7.55)\nwhere\n2 : |F|R2.\nBy (7.53) and (7.55), there are two overlapping regions in which both the WKB solutions and the\nAiry function solutions are good approximations of the solution of (7.50). The first overlapping\nregion is\n?2/3,\n1 o x ? x0\n(7.56a)\n#\nwhere x is to the right of x0, and the second overlapping region is\n#\n/3\n1 o x0 ? x o ??2 ,\n(7.56b)\n#\nwhere x is to the left of x0. The existence of such overlapping regions is crucial, as it enables us to\njoin the WKB solutions from one side of the turning point to the other side of the turning point,\nusing the Airy functions to interpolate through the region in which the WKB approximation fails.\nWe first demonstrate how this is done when (7.50) has only one turning point. We shall assume\nthat F is positive. In such a case, the kinetic energy of the particle is negative in the region x ; x0. In\nclassical mechanics, this is the region inaccessible to the particle. Thus we require the solution ` of\nthe Schrodinger equation to vanish rapidly as x increases in this region. The WKB solution satisfying\nthis requirement is\n?X\nx\nNΩxrædxr\n.\nx0\n` WKBΩxæ : e\n(7.57)\nNΩxæ\nWe may choose the solution to be a constant times the right side of (7.57), but this affects only the\noverall normalization of the wavefunction and we will leave it the way it is. The WKB solution fails\nas we continue it to the neighborhood of the turning point x0. When x is close to x0, we approximate\n(7.50) by (7.54). The two independent solutions of (7.54) are the Airy functions denoted by AiΩ[æ\nand BiΩ[æ, where\n/\n[ : ?2 3Ωx ? x0æ.\n(7.58)\n/\n?\nNote that a region of x with width unity corresponds to a region of [ with the width ?2 3. Since\n2/3 is a very large number, this region of [ is a very large region. When we study the function in the\nvariable [, it is like studying the function with a magnifier. Therefore, the small region in x given by\n(7.54), in which the Airy function solution is valid, is a large region in [.\nAs we will discuss in the next chapter, the asymptotic form of AiΩ[æ when the magnitude of [ is\nlarge is given by\nAiΩ[æ i e?2\nZ\n[3\n[\n/2\n/3\n/4 , [ i K,\n(7.59)\n/2 + Z\nsin\nΩ?[æ3\nZ Ω?[æ1\n, [ i ?K.\n(7.60)\n/4\nSince AiΩ[æ vanishes exponentially when [ is large and positive, it satisfies the requirement we\nimpose on the wavefunction. Thus the wavefunction in the neighborhood of the turning point x0 is\n`Ωxæ : cAiΩ[æ,\n(7.61)\nwhere c is a constant. To determine c, we match the solution (7.61) with the solution (7.57) in the\noverlapping region (7.56a) on the right side of x0.

      "content": "Asymptotic Expansions of Integrals\nLectures Fourteen and Fifteen\nIn the last lecture, we discuss the method of stationary phase which is applicable to the integral\n(8.36).\nIf the integral (8.36) has neither points of stationary phase nor contributions from the endpoints, the\nmethod of stationary phase fails. As an example, consider calculating the asymptotic form of\ne?iRx\nIΩRæ : X\nK\ndx, R ;; 1.\n?K\n1 + x2\n/\nThe function IΩRæ is the Fourier transform of Ω1 + x2æ?1 2. Identifying uΩxæ with ?x, we see that, since\nurΩxæ : ?1 e 0, this integral has no points of stationary phase. Nor does this integral have finite\nendpoints. Therefore, the method of stationary phase is not useful for the problem. In order to find\nthe asymptotic form of this integral, we must use the saddle point method whcih will be presetly\ndiscussed.\nD The Saddle Point Method\nThe Laplace method enables us to deal with the integral of the form of (8.8), where the coefficient of\nR in the exponent is real. The method of stationary phase enables us to deal with the integral of the\nform of (8.36), where the coefficient of R in the exponent is purely imaginary.\nIn this section, we shall deal with integrals of the form\nIΩRæ : X eiRfΩzæhΩzædz,\n(8.52)\nc\nwhere c is a contour in the complex z-plane and where fΩzæ and hΩzæ are analytic functions of z. This\nproblem is interesting in its own right but, as we have mentioned, it may also help us to evaluate the\nasymptotic form of integrals of the form (8.36) in which there are neither finite endpoints nor points\nof staionary phase.\nLet\nfΩzæ : uΩx, yæ + ivΩx, yæ,\nthen the exponential function in (8.52) is equal to\neiRfΩzæ : eiRuΩx,yæe?RvΩx,yæ .\n-- 1 --\n\nu\nAsymptotic Expansions of Integrals\nWe see that the coefficient of R in the exponent above has both a real part and an imaginary part.\nIn section 8B, we have treated the case in which u is zero. And in Section 8C, we have treated the\ncase in which v is zero. We now treat the case with neither u nor v equal to zero.\nThe magnitude of the integrand is sharply peaked around the point z0 at which v is minimum. But if\nr is not equal to zero, the integrand also oscillates rapidly in the neighborhood of z0, and the\nresulting cancellation wipes out entirely the contribution of z0.\nLet us deform, by Cauchy's integral theorem, the contour c into another contour cr. If u happens to\nbe a constant on the contour cr, then\nIΩRæ : eiRa X e?RvhΩzædz,\nc\nwhere a is the value of u on cr. Thus there is no cancellation due to the rapid changes of the phase\nfactor of the integrand and the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the point z0 on cr at\nwhich v is minimum. The asymptotic form of the integral can be obtained with the use of Laplace's\nmethod.\nThe point z0 may be an endpoint of cr. In such a case, we may obtain the leading term of the integral\nby expanding the integrand around the endpoint and carry out the integration over an exponential\nfunction.\nThe point z0 may also be an interior point of cr. We shall argue that, if z0 is an interior point of cr, all\npartial derivatives of u and v must vanish at z0.\nWe begin by observing that, since v is minimum at z0 along the curve cr, the variation of v in the\ntangential direction of cr vanishes at z0. Also, since u is constant on cr, the variation of u in the\ntangential direction of cr is zero. The latter means that, by the Cauchy-Riemann equation, the\nvariation of v in the direction orthogonal to the tangential direction of of cr is zero. Thus both partial\nderivatives of v vanish at z0. By the Cauchy-Riemann equations, so do the two partial derivatives of\nu at z0. Indeed,\nfrΩz0æ : 0.\nThe point z0 is known to be a saddle point for the integral (8.52), as we shall explain further below.\nSince, along the contour c, v is minimum at z0 and u is stationary, the dominant contribution to the\nintegral over c comes from the saddle point z0. The asymptotic form of the integral can be obtained\nby expanding the integrand around z0 and carrying out the Gaussian integrals.\nAs we deform the contour, we may encounter singularities of the integrand. The Cauchy integral\ntheorem is then no more applicable and we may not deform the contour beyond the singularity. Thus\nthe singularity may contribute a dominant contribution to the integral.\nIn summary, for the integral of the general form (8.52), the possible points of contribution are the\nsingular points, the endpoints, and the saddle points.\nThere may be more than one saddle points or singular points in the problem. Not all of them\ncontribute to the asymptotic form of the integral. We must decide what contour to deform to and\nwhich saddle points or singular points are relevant. We shall show how to do this below.\nDoing this will require a little understanding of complex analysis. Here we'll add to our previous\ndiscussions on this topic.\nA curve on which u is a constant is called a level curve of u. A curve on which v is a constant is\ncalled a level curve of v. We shall show that, with certain notable exceptions, the level curves of u\nintersect orthogonally with the level curves of v.\nProblem for the Reader:\nConsider in the complex plane the function\nfΩzæ : z2 : Ωx + iyæ2.\nDraw the level curves of u as well as those of v for this function.\nAnswer\nWe have\nuΩx, yæ : x2 ? y2, and vΩx, yæ : 2xy.\nWe draw the level curves of u and the level curves of v :constant in the figure below.\n-- 2 --\n\nAsymptotic Expansions of Integrals\nA\nD\nC\nC\nD\nB\nE\nE\nF\nF\nx\ny\nu = 0\nv =\nu = 0\n'\n'\n'\n'\nu = 0\nu = 0\nv = 1\n\nv =\nv =\nu =\nu = 1\n\nv =\nv = 1\n\nu =\nu = 1\n\nu = 1\n\nu =\nu =\nu = 1\n\nFigure 8.8.\nQuestion for the Reader:\nDo the level curves of u and those of v intersect orthogonally?\nAnswer\nYes, as we can see from Fig. 8.8, the level curves of u generally intersect orthogonally with those of\nv.\nBut there is one notable exception. There are two level curves of u and two level curves of v\nintersecting at the origin. The level curves of u and those of v do not intersect orthogonally at the\norigin. Instead, the two level curves of u intersect orthogonally at the origin. So do the two level\ncurves of v. We note also that the derivative of fΩzæ vanishes at the origin, which is where the\naforementioned unsual behavior occurs.\nAs a general rule, if u and v are harmonic conjugates of each other the level curves of u and those of\nv intersect orthogonally, . To see this, we express the infinitesimal variation of uΩx, yæ as\ndu : uxdx + uydy.\nNow on a level curve of u, the value of u does not vary. Therefore we have\nuxdx + uydy : 0,\nwhere dx and dy are the variations of x and y between two neighboring points on the level curve of u.\nThis says that 4u is perpendicular to the tangent vector of the level curve of u.\nSimilarly, 4v is perpendicular to the tangent vector of the level curve of v.\nNow\nΩ4uæ 6 Ω4væ : uxvx + uyvy : 0,\nwhere the last step is obtained with the use of the Cauchy-Riemann equations (2.9). Therefore, at the\npoint a level curve of u and a level curve of v intersect, the tangent vectors of these two curves are\nothogonal to each other.\nBut there are exceptions. The points of exception are the points at which the derivative of fΩzæ\nvanishes. At each of such points, all of the partial derivatives of u and v vanish. Thus both 4u and 4v\nare null vectors at such a point and neither possess a direction. While the scalar product of 4u and 4v\nremain to vanish at a zero of fr, it is due to the vanishing of the gradient vectors, and not due to the\northogonality of the gradient vectors.\nNote also that two level curves of u generally do not intersect. Let a level curve be given by\nuΩx, yæ : c.\nAnd let Ωx0, y0æ be a point on this curve. Now by the implicit function theorem, the equation above\nhas a unique solution in a neighborhood of Ωx0, y0æ with the form\ny : yΩxæ,\nprovided that uyΩx0, y0æ e 0. Similarly, it has a unique solution in a neighborhood of Ωx0, y0æ with the\n-- 3 --\n\nAsymptotic Expansions of Integrals\nform\nx : xΩyæ,\nprovided that uxΩx0, y0æ e 0. Thus, unless both ux and uy vanish, there can only be one level curve\npassing through the point Ωx0, y0æ. But at the point z0 at which frΩz0æ : 0, both ux and uy vanish, and\nthere is no reason why two level curves of u cannot intersect at z0. Indeed, we see in the example\nabove that two level curves of u do intersect at the origin. Also, two level curves of v in this example\nalso intersect at the origin.\nWe have learned in calculus that if the derivative of a function of a real variable x vanishes at x0,\nthen it has an extremum at x0 provided that its second derivative does not vanish. This is quite\ndifferent for uΩx, yæ and vΩx, yæ, which are functions of two variables. Near the point z0 at which the\nderivative of fΩzæ vanishes, we have\nfΩzæ ? fΩz0æ p frrΩz0æΩz ? z0æ2/2.\nTherefore, if frrΩz0æ e 0, the behavior of fΩzæ near z0 is the same as the function z2 near the origin.\nProblem for the Reader:\nLet vΩx, yæ : 2xy, the imaginary part of z2. What is the behavior of v on the line x : y and the line\nx : ?y? What does v look like near x : y : 0?\nAnswer\nThe line x : y is a level curve of u. On this line v:2x2, and is minimum at the origin.\nThe line x : ?y is also a level curve of u. On this line v : ?2x2, and is maximum at the origin.\ne\nIf we consider vΩx, yæ as a function of x and y in a three-dimensional space, it resembles the surface\nof a saddle near the point x : y : 0, where the line x : y is in the front-back direction of the saddle,\nand the line x : ?y is in the sidewise direction of the saddle. The function vΩx, yæ is neither\nabsolutely maximum nor absolutely minimum at the origin. Thus the origin is a saddle point of v.\nSimilarly, the origin is a saddle point of u : x2 ? y2.\nIf u and v are the real part and the imaginary part of an analytic function the derivative of which\nvanishes at z0, then z0 is a saddle point of u and that of v.\nBy definition, the value of a function vΩx, yæ does not vary on any of its level curves. Thus it varies\nmost rapidly in the direction orthogonal to its level curve. Since the level curves of u intersect those\nof v orthogonally, v varies most rapidly on a level curve of u, and u varies most rapidly on a level\ncurve of v.\nAs a consequence, the function e?Rv varies most rapidly on a level curve of u. Now we have seen that\nthere are two level curves of u passing through the point z0. We have also seen that the function\nvΩx, yæ is minimum on one of these curves, and maximum on the other curve. Thus the function\n?RvΩzæ decreases most rapidly as one leaves z0 on the former curve. This curve is called the path of\nsteepest descent. Similarly, e?RvΩzæ increases most rapidly as one leaves z0 on the latter curve, which\nis called the path of steepest ascent.\nConsider now the integral in the general form of (8.52). If c is a level curve of uΩx, yæ, the phase of\nthe exponential function of (8.52) is a constant and can be taken outside of the integral. Also, the\nmagnitude e?RvΩx,yæ varies most rapidly on c. Thus the integral is of the form of (8.8), and the\ndominant contributions come from the point at which v is minimum. It is therefore a good idea to\ndeform the contour of the integral of (8.52) into a level curve of u, for then the asymptotic form of\nthe integral can be obtained with the Laplace method.\nTake the example of (8.47), in which fΩzæ : z2. We cannot easily go from ?1 to 1 on a curve of\nconstant u. Let us therefore take the path ACDEFB in the figure. Along the path AC, the phase\nuΩx, yæ is a constant and vΩx, yæ is minimum at the endpoint A. Thus the dominant contribution to the\nintegral along AC is given by a small neighborhood of width 1/R near the endpoint A, and can be\ncalculated by the Laplace method. The result is the same as we have obtained by using the formula\n(8.39) and keeping only the contribution from the endpoint A. The contour CD is not a level curve of\nu. Instead, it is a level curve of v, on which v : 1. The integrand on CD is as small as e?R, hence the\nintegral over CD will be neglected. Next we consider the contour DE. This contour is a path of\nsteepest descent with the saddle point at the origin. Thus we may again use the Laplace method to\nevaluate the contribution of the origin, and the answer is the same as that calculated with the use of\n(8.45). The contribution of the contour EF, which is not a level curve of u, will be neglected as the\nintegrand is exponentially small on this contour. The dominant contribution of the contour FB,\nwhich is a level curve of u, comes from the point B. Applying the Laplace method gives us the same\n-- 4 --\n\nAsymptotic Expansions of Integrals\nresult obtained with the use of (8.39). Thus, by deforming the contour of integration, we succeed in\nverifying (8.48) with the application of the Laplace method.\nA\nD\nC\nC\nD\nB\nE\nE\nF\nF\nx\ny\nu = 0\nv =\nu = 0\n'\n'\n'\n'\nu = 0\nu = 0\nv = 1\n\nv =\nv =\nu =\nu = 1\n\nv =\nv = 1\n\nu =\nu = 1\n\nu = 1\n\nu =\nu =\nu = 1\n\nFigure 8.8.\nWe note that it will not be fruitful to deform the contour from the real axis to the curve AC'D'E'F'B.\nFor if we do this, we will find that on the curve AC', v is minimum not at A but at C'. Thus the\ndominant contributions to the integral over AC' come from the point C', where the integrand is of\nthe order of eR. This large term is cancelled by an equally large term with the opposite sign coming\nfrom the integral over C'D'. Also, while the contour D'E' passes through the saddle point z : 0, this\ncontour is one of the steepest ascent and the contributions of this contour come not from the saddle\npoint z : 0 but from the endpoints D' and E'. Indeed, the integral over each of the segments of the\ncurve AC'D'E'F'B has a very large leading term. These terms cancel one another and it is extremely\ndifficult to determine what remains after such extensive cancellations.\nTherefore, as we start from an endpoint of the contour and try to deform the contour to a level curve\nof u, be sure to go in the direction v increases, not the other way around.\nIt is possible to deform the contour into a sum of curves all of which are level curves of u. Instead of\ntaking the contour ACDEFB to go from A to B, we may go from A to C on the level curve of u as\nbefore, but instead of making a turn at C, we follow this level curve all the way to infinity. We then\nchange over at infinity to the line x : y, and go from one infinite end of this straightline to another\ninfinite end of this straightline. Then we change over at infinity to the level curve on which F and B\nlie to arrive at B. In this way u is a constant on each of the segments of the contours.\nApplying the Laplace method to each of the contours, we may obtain not only the leading term but\nalso the next leading terms. To do this, we merely have to keep more terms in the expansions of the\nintegrand around the points of contribution and carry out the integration.\n-- 5 --"

      "content": "The WKB Approximation\nLectures Nine and Ten The WKB\nApproximation\nThe WKB method is a powerful tool to obtain solutions for many physical problems. It is\ngenerally applicable to problems of wave propagation in which the frequency of the wave is very\nhigh or, equivalently, the wavelength of the wave is very short. The WKB solutions are approximate\nsolutions, but sometimes they are surprisingly accurate. In this chapter we'll discuss this method,\nwhich is applicable to linear equations only.\nA The Zeroth and the First-Order WKB\nWe consider the second-order differential equation\nyrr + p2y : 0.\n(7.1)\nIf p is a constant, the two independent solutions of (7.1) are expΩcipxæ, waves with wave number p\ntravelling in opposite directions of the x-axis.\nIf p is a function of x, it appears reasonable that the solutions are two waves with the phase\nc X pΩxædx. Thus we may surmise that the independent solutions of (7.1) are\nci X pΩxædx\ne\n,\n(7.2)\nwhich are the zeroth-order WKB solutions.\nLet us see if these solutions satisfy (7.1). We have\nci X pΩxædx\nci X pΩxædx\nd2 + p2 e\n: cipre\ne 0. Ω7.3æ\ndx2\nTherefore, the WKB solutions (7.2) do not satisfy (7.1) unless pr : 0, or p is independent of x.\nWhile we get a negative answer, (7.3) suggests that expΩci X pΩxædxæ are good approximate\nsolutions of (7.1) provided that cipr is negligible, or, more precisely, if\n|pr| o p2,\nthe left-side of this inequality being a term inside the parenthesis of (7.3). The inequality above can\nbe written as\nd 1\no 1.\n(7.4)\np\ndx\nThis condition is satisfied if pΩxæ is of the form\npΩxæ e RPΩxæ,\n(7.5)\nwhere R is a large constant, i.e.,\nR ;; 1,\n(7.6)\nand PΩxæ is of the order of unity. Indeed, if pΩxæ is given by (7.5), the inequality (7.4) is\n1 d\no 1.\n(7.7)\nR dx PΩxæ\nClearly, (7.7) is satisfied if R ;; 1, provided that x is not near a zero of PΩxæ.\nWe note that the phases of the solutions expΩci X pΩxædxæ are functions of x, but the magnitudes\nof these approximate solutions are independent of x. Let us remember that, in Chapter 1, we have\nshown that if y1 and y2 are two independent solutions of (7.1), then the Wronskian\nr\nr\nWΩxæ e y1y2 ? y1y2 is independent of x. Now the Wronskian of expΩi X pΩxædxæ and expΩ?i X pΩxædxæ\nis easily shown to be equal to 2ipΩxæ, not a constant unless pΩxæ is a constant. This suggests that these\napproximate solutions still leave something to be desired. Because the Wronskian of the\napproximate solutions miss by a factor pΩxæ, let us try to fix it by adding an additional factor 1/ pΩxæ\nto each of the approximate solutions. The resulting approximate solutions are\nci X pΩxædx\nc\nyWKB Ωxæ :\ne\n.\n(7.8)\npΩxæ\nwhich includes both the zeroth order and the first order terms of the WKB approximations.\n-- 1 --\n\nThe WKB Approximation\nc\nThe magnitude of these solutions varies with x like 1/ pΩxæ . The Wronskian of yWKB Ωxæ is now\nexactly a constant. (See homework problem 1.) It is therefore tempting to surmise that, under the\nci X pΩxædx\nc\ncondition (7.4) or equivalently, (7.7), yWKB Ωxæ are even better approximations than e\n.\nTo see if this is true, we put\nci X pΩxædx\ny e e\nv,\nΩ7.9æ\nand substitute this expression of y into (7.1). We get\nΩD c ipæΩD c ipæv + p2v : 0.\nor\nc 2ip d\nΩ d2\ndx c ipræv : 0.\ndx2\nWe shall write the equation above as\nvr + pr\nv : c 2\ni\np v\".\n(7.10)\n2p\nBy (7.5), (7.10) can be written as\nvr + Pr v : cK i vrr ,\n(7.11)\n2P\n2P\nwhere\nL e 1/R\nis a small number. In the first-order approximation, we ignore the right side of (7.11) and we get\nvr + Pr v u 0,\n(7.12)\n2P\nwhich gives\nvΩxæ u\n.\n(7.13)\nPΩxæ\nThus (7.9) and (7.13) give, aside from an immaterial overall constant, the WKB solutions (7.8).\nWe have mentioned that if PΩxæ has a zero at x0, the inequality (7.10) does not hold at x0. To see\nhow far away from x0 it must be for the WKB approximation to hold, let PΩxæ near x0 be\napproximately given by\nPΩxæ u aΩx ? x0æn , x u x0.\n(7.14)\nThen (7.7) requires\n|x ? x0| o\nn\nRa\n1/Ωn+1æ .\n(7.15)\nEq. (7.15) tells us how far away from x0 it must be for the WKB approximate solutions to be valid.\nIf PΩxæ vanishes in the way given by (7.14), we say that PΩxæ has an nth-order zero at x0. Not all\nzeroes of PΩxæ are of finite order, and an example of PΩxæ having a zero of infinite order is given by\nhomework problem 6. The range of validity of the WKB solutions of homework problem 6 is given\nin homework problem 5b.\nAs we have mentioned, the WKB approximation is useful for describing the propagation of waves\nwith very high frequencies or, equivalently, very small wavelengths. As an example, consider the\nproblem of determining the shadow cast on a wall by a point light source in front of a screen. To\nobtain the exact solution of this problem, one solves the wave equation and make the solution satisfy\nthe boundary conditions imposed by the presence of the screen, which is a difficult boundary-value\nproblem. On the other hand, the shadow on the wall is very accurately determined simply by\ndrawing straight lines from the light source to the edges of the screen. This is because when the\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the dimensions of the screen, the WKB approximation\ncan be used to justify the results obtained with the use of geometric optics. footnote As another\nexample, we know that Newtonian mechanics is an approximation of quantum mechanics. However,\nthe behavior of atoms obeying the rules of wave mechanics is drastically different from that of\nparticles obeying the rules of Newtonian mechanics. How does one reconcile these two sets of rules?\nThe answer again lies in the WKB approximation, in which the Schrodinger equation is reduced to\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi equation satisfied by the classical action of Newtonian mechanics.\nThe WKB approximation can also be used to solve problems in which the functional behavior is\n-- 2 --\n\nThe WKB Approximation\nrapidly growing or rapidly decaying other than rapidly oscillatory, an example being the problems of\nboundary layer which we will discuss in Chapter 9. Consider the equation\nyrr ? N2y : 0.\n(7.16)\nThe WKB solutions are given by\nc\nyWKB Ωxæ :\ne\ncX NΩxædx .\n(7.17)\nNΩxæ\nThese solutions are good approximations of the solutions of (7.16) if\nd\ndx\nNΩxæ\no 1.\n(7.18)\nThe counterpart of (7.5) is\nNΩxæ : RNΩxæ,\n(7.19)\nwhere R o 1 and NΩxæ is of order unity. As before, if N is in the form (7.19), the inequality (7.18) is\nalways satisfied unless x is near a zero of NΩxæ.\nThe WKB approximation can be justified under other conditions. For example, it is easy to\nverify that (7.4) is satisfied if pΩxæ is of the form\npΩxæ : PΩKxæ, K o 1,\n(7.20)\nwhere we have a small parameter K rather than a large parameter R. If we make the change of\nvariable\nX : Kx,\nthen (7.1) becomes\nd2y + R2P2ΩXæy : 0,\ndX2\nwhere the large parameter R : K?1 appears.\nSometimes the large parameter R is not explicitly exhibited. As an example, consider the\nproblem of solving the Airy equation yrr ? xy : 0 when x is very large. In this problem, x inherently\ncontains a large parameter. Indeed, let x be of the order of ?, with ? o 1. We may put\nd\nx e ?X,\nwhere X is of the order of unity. Then the Airy equation is\n2 ? ?3X y : 0.\ndX2\nComparing with (7.16), we have, if X is positive,\n/2\nNΩXæ : RX1 ,\nwhere R e ?3/2 is the large paramater.\nWe also note that the integral X pdx is dimensionless and hence does not change with a change of\nthe scale of the independent variable. In the example of the Airy equation, we have\n/\n/\nX RX1 2dX : X x1 2dx.\nIndeed, since the dimension of the wavelength is that of length, same as that of x, the leftside of (7.4)\nis dimensionless. Thus (7.4) can be expressed either with the variable X or with the variable x, as\nd\n: d\ndX RX1/2\ndx x1/2 .\nB Solutions Near an Irregular Singular Point\nWe will now apply the WKB method to obtain the asymptotic solutions near an irregular\nsingular point of a second-order linear homogeneous equation. While we have already given a\nmethod in the preceding section to obtain these solutions, it applies only when the rank of the\nsingular point is an integer. In addition, the use of the WKB method makes it very easy to obtain the\nleading terms of the asymptotic series.\ny\nTo start, we consider the leading asymptotic terms for the solutions of the equation\nrr + xy : 0.\n(7.21)\n-- 3 --\n\nThe WKB Approximation\nFor x 9 0, we have, comparing with (7.16),\n/2\nN : Ω?xæ1 .\nThus the WKB solutions are\n?1/4ec2|x|3/2/3\n|x|\n.\n(7.22)\nWe conclude immediately that, when x is large and negative, one of these solutions is an\nexponentially increasing function of x and the other is an exponentially decreasing function of x.\nWhen x is positive, we have, comparing with (7.1),\n/2\np : x1 .\nThus the WKB solutions are\nx?1/4eci2x3/2/3,\n(7.23)\nboth being oscillatory functions of x.\nC Higher-order WKB Approximation\nWe shall in this section find the higher-order terms of the WKB approximation.\nFor this purpose let us return to eq. (7.11). Since this equation has a small parameter K and is\nlinear, it is straightforward to use it to derive successive corrections to the WKB approximations. We\nput\nv : v0 + Lv1 + K2v2 + 6 6 6,\n(7.38)\nwhere vn, n : 0, 1 6 6 6., are independent of K. The series in (7.38) is called a perturbation series\nwhich is expected to be useful when K is small.

Strictly speaking, truncating a series is justified if we succeed\nin proving that the sum of terms neglected is much less than the sum of terms kept. But proving this\nis sometimes difficult to do. We shall be content with proving that the Ωn + 1æth term in the series is\nmuch less than the nth term if K is sufficiently small.

When the parameter K is\nvery small, it is natural to expect that the solution not be very different from the one with K set to\nzero. Consider for example the motion of a harmonic oscillator of unit mass with the spring constant\nequal to Ω1 + Ke?tæ. The equation of motion for this problem is\nx6 + Ω1 + Ke?tæx : 0,\n(9.1)\nwith\nxΩ0, Kæ : 1, x%Ω0, Kæ : 0,\n(9.2)\nwhere xΩt, Kæ is the displacement of the harmonic oscillator and x% is the time derivative of x.\nEquation (9.1) can be solved in a closed form and the exact solution is a Bessel function. But if K\nis very small, the spring constant is approximately equal to unity at all times t ; 0, and to the\nlowest-order of approximation, we expect that we may ignore its small deviation from unity. Thus\nwe have\nxΩt, Kæ u xΩt, 0æ : cos t.\n(9.3)\nTo find the small correction due to the small deviation of the spring constant from unity, one may\nanticipate that, since the deviation is of the order of K, this small correction is of the order of K as\nwell. Indeed, since all terms in (9.1) are analytic functions of K, we will try to see if there is a\nsolution in the form of a Taylor series of K:\nxΩt, Kæ u x0Ωtæ + Kx1Ωtæ + ` + KnxnΩtæ + `,\n(9.4)\nwhere xnΩtæ is independent of K. Substituting (9.4) into (9.1) and (9.2), we get\nd2 + 1 øx0Ωtæ + Kx1Ωtæ + `¿ + Ke?tøx0Ωtæ + Kx1Ωtæ + `¿ : 0,\n(9.5)\ndt2\nx0Ω0æ + Kx1Ω0æ + ` : 1,\n(9.6)\nand\nx% 0Ω0æ + Kx% 1Ω0æ + ` : 0.\n(9.7)\nSetting K in the equations above to zero, we get\nx60 + x0 : 0,\nwith\nx0Ω0æ : 1, and x%0Ω0æ : 0.\nThe solution x0Ωtæ is just xΩt, 0æ given by (9.3).\nSetting to zero the coefficient of K on the leftside of (9.5), we get\nx61 + x1 : ?e?t cos t.\n(9.8)\nSimilarly, we get from (9.6) and (9.7) that\nx1Ω0æ : 0.\n(9.9)\nx% 1Ω0æ : 0.\n(9.10)\nThe solution of (9.8) satisfying (9.9) and (9.10) is\n5 cos t ? 3 sin t + e?t 2 sin t\n? cos t .\nx1Ωtæ : 1\nSince both x1Ωtæ and x0Ωtæ are OΩ1æ at all times and since K is very small, we have\n|Kx1Ωtæ|o |x0Ωtæ|\nat all times, except when t is near the points where x0Ωtæ happens to vanish.\nOne may further obtain the nth-order correction xnΩtæ from (9.5)-(9.7). We shall find that xnΩtæ is\nOΩ1æ at all times. Thus\n-- 1 --\n\nBoundary Layers and Singular Perturbation\n|KnxnΩtæ|o |Kn?1xn?1Ωtæ|.\nThe inequalities above indicate that keeping more and more terms in the series of (9.4) makes the\napproximate solution better and better.\nThe series (9.4) is a perturbation series, and the method given above in obtaining a perturbation\nseries is called that of regular perturbation.\nB Boundary Layer Theory\nIt may be surprising, but not all problems with a small parameter can be solved by regular\nperturbation. Let us start the discussion with a simple example.\nConsider the solution of the differential equation\nK dy + y : 0\n(9.11)\ndx\nwith the initial condition\nyΩ0æ : 1.\nIf we set K in the differential equation above to zero, we get\nyΩxæ : 0.\nBut this approximate solution does not satisfy the initial condition.\nIn order to understand why this is so, we solve this differential equation in a closed form. We\nfind that\n/K\nyΩxæ : e?x .\nThis solution of the differential equation satisfies the initial condition for all values of K not equal to\nzero. But if we set K to zero, the solution above vanishes, and the initial condition is not satisfied.\nIndeed, considered as a function of K, the solution of the differential equation has an essential\nsingularity at K : 0. It is therefore no wonder that it does not have a Maclaurin series expansion.\nAs a comparison, consider the solution of the equation\ndy + Ky : 0\n(9.12)\ndx\nwith the same initial condition. The exact solution is\nyΩxæ : e?Kx .\nThe approximate solution obtained by setting K in the differential equation to zero is\nyΩxæ : 1\nwhich is a good approximation of the exact solution when Kx is very small.\nWhat makes the method of regular perturbation applicable for one but not for the other? The\nanswer lies in the fact that if we set K to zero, eq. (9.12) remains a first-order differential equation,\nwhile eq. (9.11) turns into an algebraic equation. Indeed, while it is always true that the magnitude of\nKy is small compared to that of y, it is not always true that the magnitude of Kyr is small compared to\nthat of y. This is because, if yΩxæ is a rapidly varying function of x, the magnitude of the derivative of\nyΩxæ is much larger than yΩxæ. In such a case, KyrΩxæ may be of the same order of magnitude as yΩxæ.\n/\nIndeed, we may easily verify that this is true for the function yΩxæ : e?x K, the solution of (9.11).\nWe encounter similar difficulties with boundary layer problems in fluid mechanics. Let us\nconsider the second-order differential equation\nKyrrΩxæ + aΩxæyrΩxæ + bΩxæyΩxæ : 0,\n(9.13)\nwhich generally cannot be solved in a closed form. We shall choose the interval in which (9.13)\nholds to be ø0, 1¿ . Typically, we require that the solution satisfies the boundary conditions:\nyΩ0æ : A, yΩ1æ : B.\n(9.14)\nThe parameter K is very small, while A and B are OΩ1æ. Note that the small parameter K is the\ncoefficient of yrr .\nThis problem is a simplified model of the boundary layer problem in fluid mechanics. As we\nknow, the highest-order term in the Navier-Stokes equation in fluid mechanics is equal to T42v3,\nwhere v3 is the velocity of the fluid and T is the kinematic viscosity. The kinematic viscosity is often a\nsmall parameter, and the order of the Navier-Stokes equation decreases if we ignore the viscosity.\nEquation (9.13) can be solved with good accuracy with the use of the WKB method. (See\n-- 2 --\n\nBoundary Layers and Singular Perturbation\nhomework problem 1.) However, we gain more insights to this problem by starting afresh.\nLet us set K : 0. Then (9.13) becomes\naΩxæyr + bΩxæy : 0.\nThis equation is readily solved and we get\nysΩxæ : exp ?X bΩxæ dx .\n(9.15)\naΩxæ\nThe fact is that eq. (9.13) is of the second order, and has two independent solutions. But the\napproximate equation we obtain is of the first order, and has only one independent solution. Thus the\napproximate method we use yields only one of the independent solutions. This is to say that we lose\none of the independent solutions as we set K in the differential equation to zero. It is impossible to\nsatisfy the two boundary conditions of (9.14) with only one solution.\nHow do we find the missing solution approximately? To get some insight into the answer, let us\ngo to the much simpler case in which a and b are constants. Then the general solution of (9.13) is\nequal to\nc1er1x + c2er2x ,\nwhere c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants and r1 and r2 are the roots of the quadratic equation\nKr2 + ar + b : 0.\nThis quadratic equation can be solved easily. But if we set K in this quadratic equation to zero, we get\nonly one root\nr u ?b/a,\nwhich gives the solution\ne?bx/a .\nThe solution is equal to the one denoted by ysΩxæ in (9.15) with aΩxæ and bΩxæ replaced by the\nconstants a and b, respectively. The other root of the quadratic equation is obtained by solving the\nequation exactly. When K is very small, this root is approximately given by\n? a/K.\nThis root tells us that the second solution of the differential equation is approximately\ne?ax/K\ny\n.\nWe see that this solution is a rapidly varying function of x. Indeed, it is a rapidly decreasing function\nof x if a is positive, and a rapidly increasing function of x if a is negative.\nThat the missing solution is a rapidly varying function of x also explains why it is not always\nlegitimate to drop the yrr term in (9.13). Let us denote the rapidly varying solution by yrΩxæ. Then\nr r Ωxæ is of the order of K?1 times yrΩxæ, and yr rrΩxæ is of the order of K?2 times yrΩxæ. Therefore, the\nterm Kyr rrΩxæ is bigger than yrΩxæ by a large multiple of K?1. Again, while it is true that Ky, say, is\nalways much smaller than y, it is not always true that Kyrr is much smaller than y.\nr\nOn the other hand, ys rr and ys are both of the same order of magnitude as ys. Thus it is justified to\ntreat Kyrr as a small perturbation term. Thus we write (9.13) as\nrrΩxæ,\naΩxæys r Ωxæ + bΩxæysΩxæ : ?Kys\n(9.16)\nand seek the solution ysΩxæ in the perturbation series\nysΩxæ : yΩ\ns\n0æΩxæ + KyΩ\ns\n1æΩxæ +6 6 6.\nSubstituting this series into (9.16), we easily find that ys\nΩ0æΩxæ is given by (9.15), and that\naΩxæ d\ndx2 ys\nΩn?1æΩxæ, n : 1, 2 6 6 6.\n(9.17)\ny\ndx\nΩ\ns\nnæΩxæ + bΩxæyΩ\ns\nnæΩxæ : ? d2\nThus ys\nΩnæΩxæ, n : 1, 2, 6 6 6, satisfies a first-order ODE with the inhomogeneous term equal to the\nΩ0æ\nnegative of the second-order derivative of ys\nΩn?1æΩxæ. Once ys is found, we may then solve (9.17)\nΩ1æ\nwith n : 1 and obtain ys . Similarly, all yΩ\ns\nnæΩxæ, n : 2, 3, 6 6 6, can be obtained by successive\niteration.\nWe remark that, by treating Kys \" as a small perturbation, we have implicitly assumed that the\nsolution is slowly varying. Since all terms in the perturbation series so obtained are slowly varying,\nthe assumption is justified and the method of regular perturbation produces succesive\n-- 3 --\n\nBoundary Layers and Singular Perturbation\napproximations of the slowly varying solution. On the other hand, this method cannot produce the\nrapidly varying solution. Clearly, if the solution is rapidly varying, it is not justified to treat Kyrr as a\nsmall perturbation term.\nTo find successive approximations of the rapidly varying solution, we note that, when aΩxæ and\nbΩxæ are constants, the rapidly varying function is expΩ?ax/Kæ. Thus we surmise that, when aΩxæ and\nbΩxæ depend on x, the rapidly varying solution is approximately exp ?K?1 X aΩxædx . Therefore, we\nshall put\nyrΩxæ : exp ?K?1 X aΩxædx vΩxæ.\n(9.18)\nWith the rapidly varying behavior of yrΩxæ taken up by the exponential factor, we expect vΩxæ to be\nslowly varying. Substituting (9.18) into (9.13), we get\nv : Kvrr\navr + Ωar ? bæ\n.\n(9.19)\nTreating the term Kvrr as a small perturbation we may solve (9.19) with regular perturbation. We put\nvΩxæ : v0Ωxæ + Kv1Ωxæ +6 6 6,\n(9.20)\nand get\nX bΩxæ\nv0Ωxæ : aΩ\nxæ exp\ndx\n(9.21)\naΩxæ\nas well as\nd2\na d vn + Ωar ? bævn : dx2 vn?1.\n(9.22)\ndx\nNote that, just like (9.17) for ys\nΩnæ, (9.22) is a first-order differential equation for vn and can be solved\nin a closed form. Thus we may obtain all vn by successive iteration. We note that this prodecure\nyields us only the solution which is in the form of (9.18), where v is slowly varying. Hence it does\nnot yield ys.\nIf yrΩxæ is rapidly decreasing, we expect that it is appreciable only in a small neighborhood near\nthe lower endpoint x : 0, and drops to very small values as x gets away from the origin. The graph\nfor the solution (9.23) has a bump near x : 0. The solution is said to have a boundary layer near the\nlower endpoint.\nSimilarly, if yrΩxæ is rapidly increasing, we expect it to be appreciable only near the upper\nendpoint x : 1.\nIn a specific calculation, we may, instead of pluggin in a and b into the formulae given above,\nobtain both yout and yinΩxæ directly from (9.13). First of all, the differential equation for yout is\nobtained by neglecting the term Kyrr in (9.13). The resulting equation is of the first-order and can be\nsolved in a closed form. The multiplicative constant in this solution can be fixed with the boundary\ncondition at the endpoint where yrΩxæ is negligible. The equation for yin can be obtained by treating\nthe functions a and b as constants.\nProblem for the Reader:\nSolve approximately the equation\nKyrr + Ω1 + xæyr + y : 0, 0 9 x 9 1,\nwith the boundary conditions\nyΩ0æ : yΩ1æ : 1.\nAnswer\nWe have\naΩxæ : 1 + x ; 0,\nthus yrΩxæ is rapidly decreasing and there is a boundary layer near x : 0 with a width of order K.\nFor x outside of the boundary layer, we have\nr\nΩ1 + xæyout + yout : 0.\nThus we get\n-- 4 --\n\ne\nu\nBoundary Layers and Singular Perturbation\nc\nyoutΩxæ : 1 + x .\nThe constant c is determined from the boundary condition at x : 1 and we have\nyoutΩxæ : 1 + x .\nIn particular,\nyoutΩ0æ : 2.\nTo obtain yinΩxæ near x : 0, we make the approximation\naΩxæ u aΩ0æ : 1.\nThus\nrr\nKyin + yin u 0.\nTherefore we have\n/K\nyinΩxæ : 2 + cre?x .\nThe boundary condition\nyΩ0æ : 1\nrequires that\ncr : ?1.\nThus\n/K\nyinΩxæ : 2 ? e?x .\nWe also find that\nyuniform :\n? e?x/K .\n1 + x\nThe solution is plotted in the figure below. We see that it is given by 2/Ω1 + xæ almost everywhere.\nBut the function 2/Ω1 + xæ does not satisfy the boundary condition at x : 0. Thus the rapidly varying\nsolution yr kicks in near the point x : 0 and the solution y goes through a rapid transition inside the\nboundary layer.\nx\ne\ne\nl\ni\nni\nl\ni\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n0.8\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\ny(x)\n= 0.1\n= 0.01\nxact so ut on\nform so ut on\nFigure 9.1.\nC Turning Points\nIn the preceding section, we assume that aΩxæ is of the same sign throughout the interval in which\nthe differential equation (9.13) holds. The solutions yrΩxæ and ysΩxæ, given by (9.24) and (9.15)\nrespectively, are good approximations of the two independent solutions of the differential equation.\nBut if x0 is a simple zero of aΩxæ, the function aΩxæ changes sign at x0, and the approximations\n-- 5 --\n\nBoundary Layers and Singular Perturbation\nwe have made in the preceding section fail in the neighborhood of x0. Borrowing the terminology in\nquantum mechanics, we shall call x0 a turning point of eq. (9.13).\nTo obtain approximate solutions near a turning point, we approximate aΩxæ and bΩxæ in (9.13) by\nalgebraic functions of x, and solve the resulting equation exactly. This is the same approach as the\none used to handle the turning point of the wave equation discussed in Chapter 7. The only\ndifference is that the approximate solutions for (9.13) near a turning point are parabolic cylinder\nfunctions rather than Airy functions, as we shall show.\nIt will be convenient get rid of the yr term in (9.13). Let us write (9.13) as\na\nΩD + K æDy + b K y : 0.\nThis tells us that, to eliminate the yr term, we put\nr\ny :\n? X\nx\nexp\naΩx æ\ndxr\nYΩxæ.\n(9.42)\n2K\nThis is because, as we move the exponential factor to the left of D, we make the replacement\nD i D ? 2\na\nK .\nThus eq. (9.13) becomes\nD + a\nD ? a\nY + b K Y : 0,\n2K\n2K\nor\nD2Y +\n2bΩxæ ? arΩxæ ? a2Ωxæ Y : 0.\n(9.43)\n2K\n4K2\nSince 1/Ω4K2æ is very large, we see that an alternative way to solve eq. (9.43) is to use the WKB\nmethod, approximating NΩxæ in (7.16) by\na2 + 2KΩa r ? 2bæ\nP a P\nar ? 2b\n4K2\np\n2K\n+ 2 P a P .\nThe WKB approximation is valid provided that aΩxæ does not vanish. This approximation yields\nfor Y two WKB solutions, one of them a rapidly increasing function of x, while the other a rapidly\ndecreasing function of x. To obtain the solutions of (9.13), we multiply these two WKB solutions by\nthe exponential factor of (9.42), getting the slowly varying solution ys and the rapidly varying\nsolution yr. (See homework problem 1).\nx\nThe WKB approximation fails at a turning point. Let x0 be a turning point. We shall assume that\n0 is a simple zero of aΩxæ. Then we have, near x : x0,\naΩxæ u FΩx ? x0æ\nand\nbΩxæ u G.\nBy (7.18), the WKB approximation holds only if\nP x ? x0 P;;\nFortunately, when\nK .\nx is close to x0, or more precisely\nP x ? x0 P99 1,\neq. (9.43) is approximately\nd2Y +\n2G ? F\nF2Ωx ? x0æ2\n?\nY u 0,\n(9.44)\n2K\n4K2\ndx2\nwhich we will be able to solve in a closed form.\nx\nx0\n? FΩx ? x0æ2\n4K\n.\nx\nx0\ny\nY\nBefore we show how to do this, we first note that, when is near\n, we have\nThus, for close to\n, the solution is related to\nby\n? X\nexp\nr\nx\naΩx æ\nx0 dxr\n2K\np exp\ny u e?FΩx?x0æ2/Ω4KæY.\n(9.45)\nWe here take note that, if F is positive, the factor multiplying Y in (9.45) drops exponentially as\n|x ? x0| increases; on the other hand, if F is negative, this factor grows exponentially as |x ? x0|\nincreases.\n-- 6 --\n\nBoundary Layers and Singular Perturbation\nWe shall scale the variable Ωx ? x0æ by\nx ? x0 :\nK\n|F| X.\n(9.46)\nThen (9.44) becomes\n? signΩFæ\nd2Y\n(9.47)\n+\nG\n|F|\n? X2\nY : 0,\nwhere\nsignΩFæ : F/|F|.\nWe note that, with the independent variable scaled this way, the resulting equation (9.47) is\nindependent of the small parameter K. As a result, the solution of (9.47) varies by an amount OΩ1æ\ndX2\nthe order of\nX\nOΩ1æ\nX\nΩx ? x0æ\nK\nF\nK\nx0.\nx : x0\n,\n,\nwhen\nvaries by an amount\n. Thus we say that the scale of\nis unity. By (9.46), the scale of\nis\n. ( We have made the implicit assumption that\nis of the order of unity.) Therefore,\nthere is a boundary layer with width\nnear the turning point\nThere is a way to see directly from (9.13) that the width of the boundary layer near\nis of\nK . Let us choose x0 : 0 for convenience and write eq. (9.13) near the turning point as\nKyrr + Fxyr + Gy u 0.\nTo determine the scale of x, we make the change of variable\nx : JX.\nThen we have\nK\nd2\ndX y + Gy : 0.\nJ2 dX2 y + FX d\nWe see that if we choose\nJ :\nK ,\nthe differential equation above is independent of the small parameter K. Thus both solutions\nexpressed as functions of X are independent of K. This means that the scale of X for these solutions is\nunity, or the scale of x for these solutions is K as concluded earlier.\nEquation (9.47) is a parabolic cylinder equation, which is usually written in the generic form\nd2` + ΩT + 1/2 ? z2/4æ` : 0.\n(9.48)\ndz2\nOne of the solutions of eq. (9.48) is the parabolic cylinder function denoted by DTΩzæ. Since equation\n(9.48) is unchanged with the replacement of z i ?z, DTΩ?zæ also satisfies equation (9.48). In\naddition, (9.48) is unchanged if we make the replacements z i iz as well as T i ?T ? 1. Thus\nD?T?1Ωizæ and D?T?1Ω?izæ are also solutions of eq. (9.48).\nWe shall choose the two independent solutions of y near the turning point to be\ny1 : e?Fx2/Ω4KæDT\n|F| x\n(9.49)\nK\nand\ny2 : e?Fx2/Ω4KæDT ?\n|F| x\n(9.50)\nK\nwhere\nG ? signΩFæ + 1\nT : |F|\n.\nThe asymptotic forms of the parabolic cylinder function are given by\nDTΩXæ u XTe?X2/4 ,\nX i K,\n2Z |X|?T?1eX2/4,\nu\nX i ?K.\n<Ω?Tæ\nWe shall replace the parabolic cylinder functions in (9.49) and (9.50) by these asymptotic forms\nwhen |X| is large.\n-- 7 --\n\nBoundary Layers and Singular Perturbation\nThe qualitative behaviors of y1 and y2 depend on the sign of F. This is because the exponential\nfactor in (9.49) and (9.50) are either growing exponentially or vanishing exponentially as |X|\nbecomes large, depending on the sign of F. Thus there are two separate cases to discuss.\nCase of F ; 0\nFor F ; 0, we have\nG\nT : F ? 1.\nAlso, the exponential function vanishes as |X| increases.

      "content": "Asymptotic Expansions of Integrals\nLecture Thirteen: Method of Stationary Phase\nIn 1911, E. Rutherford performed an experiment in which F-particles were made to pass through\na thin metal foil. He measured the F -particles emerging from the foil at an angle, and found that the\nrate for such events, while being very low, is much higher than what had been expected. More\nprecise experiments performed later showed that, with the scattering angle at 90 degrees, the rate of\nsuch events is 1 event out of 8000 events. While such an event is rare, it is at least by a factor 1010\nmore frequent than what had been predicted by J. J. Thomson's atomic model. Rutherford concluded\nthat this means that an atom has a nucleus which is much, much smaller than even the tiny atom. His\ndiscovery ushered in the nuclear age. Scientists have since found that if we imagine an atom to be of\nthe size of the Earth we live on, then in proportion the nucleus would be not much bigger than a\ncampus gymnasium. Rutherford's experiment illustrates that it is not enough to know that an event is\nrare. We must also know how rare it is.\nWhile the scattering of F-particles from the atoms in the metal foil obeys the laws of quantum\nmechanics, the phenomenon Rutherford observed falls within a general pattern of wave interference.\nConsider, for example, a monochromatic wave with the amplitude eik6x3 passing through two slits in a\na\nb\ns\nwall, arriving at a point on a screen behind the wall. We illustrate this in the figure below.\nFigure 8.5.\nThe phase of the ray arriving at the screen passing through the first slit is different from that\npassing through the second slit, as the lengths of the two ray paths designated by AS and BS are\ndifferent. The amplitude of the wave at the wall is equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the two rays,\nwhich interfere with each other.\nIf there are more than two slits, then there will be more rays interfering with one another. When\nwe add up a large number of waves with the same frequency but different phases, the interference of\nthe waves tends to cancel out one another. This is especially so as the frequency becomes very high.\nTo see this, let us consider the example of the integral\nX\nb\neiRxdx.\nThis integral is a superposition of waves of the same wave number R but with a phase dependent on\nx. The magnitude of a wave is equal to unity when 0 9 x 9 b, and zero otherwise.\ne\nWe easily carry out the integration and get\niRb ? 1\nX\nb\neiRxdx :\niR\n.\n(8.33)\nAs we see from (8.33), this integral vanishes like 1/R when R is large. Since the absolute value of the\nintegrand for 0 9 x 9 b is unity, there are cancellations among the waves.\nTo understand how the cancellations come about, we observe that eiRx is a rapidly varying\nfunction of x when R is large. Indeed, as x varies by the small amount 1/R, the phase of eiRx varies by\nthe amount unity. Let us change the scale of the integration variable and define\nt : Rx.\nAs x varies by the small amount 1/R, t varies by the amount unity. The integral in (8.33) becomes\nIΩRæ : 1 X\nbR\neitdt.\n(8.34)\nR\nWhile the integrand of (8.24), considered as a function of x, is of the scale of 1/R, the integrand of\n-- 1 --\n\nAsymptotic Expansions of Integrals\n(8.34), considered as a function of t, is of the scale of unity, and is not a rapidly varying function.\nThis is like looking at a photograph with tiny structures through a magnifier, and the small-scale\nvariations become variations of normal scales. The factor 1/R multiplying the integral in (8.34) is due\nto that fact that dx is smaller than dt by a multiplicative factor R. The region of integration with t the\nintegration variable is very large, and is from 0 to bR. Yet as we integrate from t : 0 to t : 2Zn,\nwhere n is any integer, we get exactly zero. This is because both the real part and the imaginary part\nof the function eit are positive half of the time and negative half of the time, and the contributions of\nthe waves integrated over a complete cycle of width 2Z exactly cancel one another. Thus the region\nof uncancelled contributions in the t-variable is the region near the endpoint t : Rb with a width less\nthan 2Z. If we put down the magnifier, we see that the uncancelled region in the x -variable is a\nregion near the endpoint x : b with a width of the order of 1/R. That is why the integral of (8.33) is\nof the order of 1/R.\nNow let us change the lower limit of integration from zero to a, and consider the integral\nX\nb\neiRxdx,\na\nIt is clear that uncancelled contributions to the integral come from two small regions with widths of\nthe order of 1/R near the endpoints. The integral above can be exactly calculated. We have\neiRb ? eiRa\nX\nb\neiRxdx :\niR\n.\n(8.35)\na\nNote that eiRb and eiRa are the values of the integrand at the endpoints b and a, respectively.\n-- 2 --"

The variable of integration x is real. We\nshall show how to find the asymptotic form of IΩRæ as R i K.\nWe note that the integrand in the integral above is maximum when v is minimum. Indeed, let x0\nbe the point inside the interval øa, b¿ at which vΩxæ is minimum. Then the integrand at x0 is\nexponentially larger than that at any other points in the region of integration. As a result, to evaluate\nthe integral of (8.8) approximately, it is crucial to approximate vΩxæ and hΩxæ accurately near x. This\nalso means that we need not be concerned with the integrand away from x0. This is because the\ndominant contribution to the integral comes from a very small region near x0.\nProblem for the Reader:\nFind the leading asymptotic term of the integral\nK\nIΩRæ : X\n0 expΩ?R sinh2xædx, R o 1.\n(8.9)\nAnswer\nComparing (8.9) with (8.8), we make the identification\nvΩxæ : sinh2x,\nand\nhΩxæ : 1.\nThe function sinh2x is always positive, and is minimum at x : 0.

We shall show how to get a rough estimate of the\nasymptotic form of the integral IΩRæ without going through a great deal of calculations performed.\nThe integrand of IΩRæ drops by a factor of e when\nRx2 : 1,\nor\nx : 1/ R .\n/ R\n/ R\nx\n/ R .\nIΩRæ\nx :\nThus 1\nis roughly the width of the region which gives the dominant contributions to the integral.\nThe width 1\nof the region of dominant contribution is the same factor relating dx with dt.

      "content": "Singular Points of Ordinary Differential Equations\nLecture Eight\nIrregular Singular Points of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations\nSolutions expanded around an irregular singular point are distinctive in one aspect: they are\nusually in the form of an exponential function times a Frobenius series. Due to the factor of the\nexponential function, a solution near an irregular singular point behaves very differently from that\nnear a regular singular point. It may blow up exponentially, or vanish exponentially, or oscillate\nwildly.\nLet us start with the discussion of irregular singular points with the simpler case of the first-order\nlinear and homogeneous equation\nyr + pΩxæy : 0.\n(6.40)\nAs we know, the solution of (6.40) is\nyΩxæ : ce?PΩxæ ,\n(6.42)\nwhere\nPΩxæ : X pΩxædx\nwith c a constant. If pΩxæ has a pole of order Ωk + 1æ at x : 0 and hence has the Laurent series\nexpansion\npΩxæ : bk+1 + ` + b\nx\n1 + a0 + a1x2 + `,\nxk+1\nfind the solution of (6.40).\nAnswer\nWe have\nPΩxæ : ? bk+1 + ` + b1 ln x.\nkxk\nThus the solution of (6.40) is of the form\nbk+1 + `\nexp\nx?b1 MΩxæ,\nkxk\nwhere MΩxæ is a Maclaurin series. Note that x?b1 MΩxæ is a Frobenius series.\nIf pΩxæ has a pole of order Ωk + 1æ at x0 instead of at the origin, and if we are interested in the\nbehavior of the solution near x0, then we make the change of variable\nX : x ? x0.\nThe solution near x0 is given by the one given above with x replaced by X.\nWe are now ready to discuss the second-order linear homogeneous differential equations (6.38)\nwith an irregular singular point.\nLet x0 be an irregular singular point of (6.38). If\nΩx ? x0æk+1cΩxæ : c0 + c1Ωx ? x0æ + `\nand\nΩx ? x0æ2k+2dΩxæ : d0 + d1Ωx ? x0æ + `,\nare both convergent Taylor series, and if at least one of c0 and d0 are not zero, then x0 is called an\nirregular singular point of rank k. If the order of the pole of cΩxæ and that of dΩxæ at x0 are Ωk1 + 1æ\nand Ω2k2 + 2æ respectively, with k1 not equal to k2, then the rank k is equal to the greater of k1 and\nk2.\nNote that if k : 0, then x0 is a regular singular point of (6.38).\nWe mention that, if x0 is an irregular singular point of rank k, where k is a positive integer, then\nthe solutions of (6.38) are of the form\nyΩxæ : expøFΩxæ¿YΩxæ,\n(6.45)\nwhere\n-- 1 --\n\nSingular Points of Ordinary Differential Equations\nAk?1\nA1\nFΩxæ :\nAk\n+ Ωx ? x0æk?1 + ` x ? x0\nΩx ? x0æk\nand\ns\nYΩxæ : > anΩx ? x0æn+ , a0 e 0, a?1 : a?2 : ` : 0\n(6.46)\nis a Frobenius series.\nAs a general remark, if we wish to find the behavior of the solution of (6.38) at very large values\nof x, we make the change of variable\nx : 1 .\nt\nWhen x is very large, t is very small. Indeed, x : K corresponds to t : 0. By making an expansion of\nthe solution around t : 0 in the way we just outlined, we obtain an expansion around x : K.\nKeeping a few terms of this expansion is often a good approximation of the solution at very large\nvalues of x.\nThe change of the independent variable from x to t is done with\nd\ndx :\nd\ndΩ 1\nt æ : ?t2 d\ndt ,\nand\nd2\ndx2 : t2 d\ndt t2 d\ndt\n: t4 d2\ndt2 + 2t3 d\ndt .\nThus (6.38) becomes\nd2y\ndt2 + 2t ? cΩ 1\nt\nt2\næ dy\ndt + dΩ 1\nt\nt4\næ y : 0.\n(6.54)\nWe call x : K an ordinary point, a regular singular point, or an irregular singular point of rank k of\neq. (6.38), respectively, if t : 0 is an ordinary point, a regular singular point, or an irregular singular\npoint of rank k of (6.54), respectively. In particular, we see from (6.54) that the infinity is an\nirregular singular point of rank k if either dΩxæ blows up like x2k?2 or cΩxæ blows up like xk?1 as x goes\nto infinity.\nIf the infinity is an irregular singular point of rank k, then the solution of (6.38) for very large x is\nof the form\nyΩxæ : expøAkxk + Ak?1xk?1 + ` + A1x¿YΩxæ,\n(6.55)\nwhere\nYΩxæ : > anx?n?s , a0 e 0, a?1 : a?2 : ` : 0,\n(6.56)\nwhich is easily deduced from (6.45) and (6.46) by identifying Ωx ? x0æ with t, or 1/x. Note that the\nterms in the series (6.56) are in decreasing powers of x, and hence the series is a useful\napproximation for x large.\nProblem for the Reader:\nFind the series solution of\nyrr + x?4y : 0\n(6.57)\nwhich is useful for very small values of x.\nAnswer\nThe point x : 0 is an irregular singular point with rank 1. Thus the series solution near the origin\nis of the form\nA1\ny : exp\nYΩxæ,\n(6.58)\nx\nwith\ns\nYΩxæ : > anxn+ , a0 e 0, a?1 : a?2 : ` : 0.\n(6.59)\nWe substitute (6.58) into (6.57). We get\n2 + 1\nd2Y ? 2A1 dY + Ω 2A1\nA1\n+\næY : 0.\n(6.60)\ndx2\nx2\ndx\nx3\nx4\nThe value of A1 is determined by requiring the most divergent term in the coefficient of Y in (6.60)\n-- 2 --\n\nSingular Points of Ordinary Differential Equations\nto vanish. There is, in eq. (6.60), a term in the coefficient of Y which is a fourth-order pole at the\npoint of expansion x0 : 0. Thus we require\n2 + 1 : 0,\nor\nA1\nA1 : ci.\nLet us choose the root\nA1 : i.\nThen (6.60) becomes\nΩ d2 ? 2i\nd + 2i æY : 0.\ndx2\nx2 dx\nx3\nOne of the solutions can be obtained by inspection. We get\nYΩxæ : x.\nThis result can also be obtained if we go through the grind to obtain the recurrence formula\nΩn + s ? 1æΩn + s ? 2æan?1 : 2iΩn + s ? 1æan.\nFrom the recurrence formula with n : 0, we get\na\ns : 1.\nThus the recurrence formula is\nnΩn ? 1æan?1 : 2inan.\nSetting n : 1, we obtain from the recurrence formula that\n1 : 0,\nand hence a2 : a3 : 6 6 6 : 0. Therefore, the series solution for YΩxæ terminates after one term.\nThus we have obtained the closed form expression of one of the independent solutions of (6.57) as\ni\ny1Ωxæ : xexp\n.\nx\nTaking the complex conjugate y1Ωxæ, we get the second independent solution of (6.57) as\n? i\ny2Ωxæ : xexp\n.\nx\nProblem for the Reader:\nFind the series solution of the Bessel equation\nyrr + x?1yr + Ω1 ? p2/x2æy : 0\n(6.61)\nwhich is useful for very large values of x.\nAnswer\nWe may read off the rank at infinity from the Bessel equation (6.61) directly, without changing\nthe independent variable from x to t.\nAs x goes to infinity, the coefficient of y goes to a constant, or x0. Therefore, according to this\ncoefficient,\n2k ? 2 : 0,\nor\nk : 1.\nThe coefficient of yr is x?1. Thus, according to this coefficient,\nk ? 1 : ?1,\nor\nk : 0.\nThe rank of the Bessel equation at x0 : K is the greater of the two, and is unity.\nThus we put\nyΩxæ : expΩA1xæYΩxæ\nwhere\nYΩxæ : > anx?n?s , a0 : 1, a?1 : a?2 : ` : 0.\nThe Bessel equation becomes\nΩD2 + 2A1D + x?1D + A1\n2 + 1 + A1/x ? p2/x2æY : 0.\n-- 3 --\n\nSingular Points of Ordinary Differential Equations\nWe require the sum of the most divergent terms in the coefficient of Y in the equation above vanish.\nAs x i K, the coefficient of Y in the equation above is ΩA1\n2 + 1æ. Thus we get\nA1 : ci.\nThis determines the two roots of A1.\nTake the root\nA1 : i.\nThen the equation for Y becomes\nYrr + Ω2i + x?1æYr + Ωi/x ? p2/x2æY : 0.\nWe have\nΩD2 + x?1D ? p2/x2æYΩxæ : >øΩn + sæΩn + s + 1æ ?

Since JpΩxæ is a\nsolution of the Bessel equation, it must be a linear superposition of y1 and y2. Thus we have\nJpΩxæ : cy1Ωxæ + c7y2Ωxæ.\nThe coefficient c cannot be determined with the present analysis, but we will be able to show in\nThus\nc : e?iZΩ1/4+p/2æ\n2Z\n.\nChapter 8 that\nJpΩxæ u\nZ2 x cosΩx ? Z/4 ? pZ/2æ, x ;; 1.\nThe series (6.63) and (6.64) differ from the series (6.32) in one important aspect: the former are\ndivergent for all values of x! This can be seen from (6.62), which shows that, when n is very large,\nthe ratio an/an?1 goes to infinity.\nThat these series are divergent does not imply that they are not useful for the purpose of\napproximation. Indeed, they are called asymptotic series and give very good approximations to the\nsolutions when x is large if the number of terms is chosen appropriately.\nThe classic example of an asymptotic series is\ne?t\nIΩxæ : X\nK\ndt, x N 0.\n(6.65)\n0 1 + tx\nWe have\n-- 4 --\n\nSingular Points of Ordinary Differential Equations\nThus we expect\nIΩ0æ : X\nK\ne?tdt : 1.\nIΩxæ u 1,\nwhen x is small.\nTo seek an approximation better than this, we approximate the factor Ω1 + txæ?1 in the integrand\nof IΩtæ by\nn\nu 1 ? tx + t2x2 + ` + Ω?txæ .\n1 + tx\nUsing this approximation for the integrand of IΩxæ, we get\nIΩxæ u X\nK\ne?tø1 ? tx + t2x2 + ` + Ω?txæn ¿dt\nn\n: 1 ? x + 2!x2 + ` + n!Ω?xæ .\n(6.66)\nThe first term of this series is unity, an approximation we have already obtained. However, we note\nthat the series in (6.66) diverges for all values of x as we let n i K.\nNevertheless, (6.66) is a useful formula for approximation, as we shall prove. We have\nn+1\n: 1 ? tx + t2x2 + 6 6 6 +Ω?txæn + Ω?\ntx\n+\næ\ntx ,\n1 + tx\nwhich is exact. Thus we have\nIΩxæ : X\nK\ne?tø1 ? tx + t2x2 + ` + Ω?txæn ¿dt + Rn,\n(6.67)\nwhere\nn+1\ne?t Ω?txæ\nRn : X\nK\ndt.\n1 + tx\nEquation (6.67) is exact. This is to be compared with (6.66), which is obtained by dropping Rn.\nHow big is the term dropped? We have\nP Rn Pi X\nK\ne?tΩtxæn+1dt : xn+1Ωn + 1æ!.\nLet x : 0.1. Then the sum of the first five terms of (6.66), which is of the order of unity, differs from\nthe exact value by R4, which is estimated to be about one tenth of one percent. We may improve this\napproximation somewhat by taking more terms. But as the series eventually diverges, it is obviously\nnot a great idea to be too enthused and take a large number of terms in (6.66). Where do we stop?\nVery roughly, we should stop when the upper bound of Rn no longer goes down as we increase n by\nunity. For x : 0.1, this happens when n : 10.\nIf x : 0.01, and if we take one hundred terms in the series (6.57), the error is as small as 10? .\nHomework Problems due Wed next week ( Oct 13, 04)\nChapter 6, problem8.\nChapter 7, problem 1 and 2.\n-- 5 --"

      "content": "Separation of Variables\nLecture 5\nSeparation of Variables\nUnlike first-order partial differential equations, solvable second-order partial differential\nequations are much more limited in number. Many such second-order partial differential equations\nare solved with the method of separation of variables. In particular, the method of separation of\nvariables can be used to solve all the partial differential equations discussed in the preceding chapter,\nwhich are linear, homogeneous, and of constant-coefficient. The method of separation of variables\nmay also be useful for a number of linear partial differential equations with non-constant\ncoefficients; we'll give an example of this at the end of the chapter.\nWe use a superposition of such solutions, in the form (4.39), to satisfy the initial condition\n(4.37).\nIn this chapter, we shall discuss the method of separation of variables and demonstrate this\nmethod with several PDEs examples.\nA The Laplace Equation\nWe shall start again with the Laplace equation in two spatial dimensions:\nuxx + uyy : 0,\n(5.1)\nwhich holds inside the unit dis\nx2 + y2 9 1.\n(5.2)\nLet us adopt the polar coordinates r and O. We shall require that, on the boundary of this disk, uΩr, Oæ\nsatisfies the condition\nuΩ1, Oæ : gΩOæ,\n(5.3)\nwhere\nO : tan?1 y\nx ,\n(5.4)\nand\nr e\nx2 + y2 .\n(5.5)\nThis is a boundary-value problem for the Laplace equation.\nNote that, because the geometry of this problem is cylindrically symmetrical, it is more\nconvenient to use as the independent variables the polar coordinates r and O instead of the Cartesian\nvariables x and y.\nWe shall find the solution of the Laplace equation in the form\nu : RΩræ>ΩOæ,\n(5.15)\nwhich is a product of a function of r and a function of O.\nProblem for the Reader:\nSubstitute (5.15) into (5.14) and divide the resulting equation by RΩræ>ΩOæ/r2.\nAnswer:\nThe eigenvalues are\nn2, n : 0, 1, 2`\nand the eigenfunctions are\ne\n> :\ncinO\nand\nRnΩræ : rn or r?n , n ; 0,\nR0Ωræ : 1 or ln r.\n(5.25)\nAny solution of the form RnΩræecinO satisfies the Laplace equation. Since the Laplace equation is\nlinear, a linear superposition of them also satisfies the Laplace equation. We shall use a linear\nsuperposition of these solutions to fulfill the boundary condition (5.3).\nWe mention that not all solutions found above are always employed to satisfy the boundary\ncondition. For the Laplace equation (5.1) which holds inside the unit disk r 9 1, the solutions r?n and\nln r must be excluded. This is because they blow up at r : 0. Therefore we put\n-- 1 --\n\nSeparation of Variables\nK\nuΩr, Oæ : A0 +> ΩAn cos nO + Bn sin nOærn .\n(5.26)\nNext we turn to the wave equation in two spatial dimensions. This equation is satisfied by the\ndisplacement of the surface of a circular drum, which we'll study in this section. The surface of the\ndrum has circular symmetry, therefore, for the vibration of the drum surface, the spatial variables we\nshall use are the polar coordinates r and O. The equation is\n/2u\n/t2 ? /2u\n/r2 ? 1 r /u\n/r ? 1\nr2 /2u\n/2O : 0,\nwhere\nu : uΩr, O, tæ,\na function of three variables.\nThe PDE is of second order in each of the independent variables. We note that, in this equation,\nthe sign of the coefficient of utt is opposite to that of urr. Therefore, the PDE is hyperbolic between\nthe variables t and r. Similarly, it is hyperbolic between t and O. Thus we impose two initial\nconditions at t : 0 :\nuΩr, O, 0æ : fΩr, Oæ,\n(5.32)\nand\nutΩr, O, 0æ : gΩr, Oæ.\n(5.33)\nThe PDE is elliptic in the spatial variables, thus we impose the boundary condition\nuΩ1, O, tæ : 0,\n(5.34)\nwhich is well-posed.\nThe conditions above are physically meaningful as well. Equation (5.34) says that the\ncircumference of the drum is kept fixed at all times, and (5.32) and (5.33) give the initial\ndisplacement and the initial velocity of the surface of the drum. We expect from experience that a\nunique solution of the wave equation will result under these conditions. It is satisfying that such a set\nof conditions on the solution makes the problem well-posed.\nProblem for the Reader:\nApply the method of separation of variables to the wave equation by putting\nu : TΩtæRΩræ>ΩOæ,\n(5.35)\nand obtain the equations for TΩtæ, RΩræ and >ΩOæ.\nAnswer:\nWe get\nuΩr, O, tæ : > øeicnmtΩanmeinO + bnme?inOæ + e?icnmtΩcnmeinO + dnme?inOæ¿JnΩcmnræ.\nn,m\nwhere\nJnΩcnmæ : 0.\nThis solution satisfies the wave equation as well as the boundary condition (5.34). And the\ncoefficients amn, bmn, cmn and dmn are so chosen that the initial conditions (5.32) and (5.33) are\nsatisfied.\nMore detailed discussions and examples can be found in the text book.\n-- 2 --"

      "content": "Chapter1\nThe Differential Operator\nA . C alculus\nLet us first introduce a shorthand notation for the differential operator:\nd\nD\n.\n(1.1)\ndx\nWe note that\nm x\nD em x = me\n.\nThis means that, when it operates on e mx , the differential operator D is\nsimply equal to the constant m :\nD ! m .\nIndeed,\nD2 mx\n2 mx\ne\n= m e\n.\nmx\nThus, when it operates on e\n,\nD2 ! m .\nmx\nSimilarly , when it operates on e\n,\nDn ! m n , n = 2, 3 · ·· .\nTherefore, when it operates on e mx, the operator P (D) can be replaced by\nP (D) ! P (m),\n(1.2)\nwhere P (D) is a polynomial of D .\nB. Ordinary Differential Equation\nNext we give a brief review of ordinary differential equations (ODE).\nWe may classify an ODE by its order and by whether it is linear or non-linear.\nGenerally, It is much more difficult to solve a non-linear ODE than a linear\nODE in a closed form. And it is much more difficult to solve a high-order ODE\nthan a low-order ODE in a closed form.\nConsider the simplest of differential equations\ndy + p(x)y = q(x).\n(1.9)\ndx\nIn (1.9), p(x) and q(x) are functions of x. Since the highest order derivative\nin the equation above is the first derivative, the equation is called an ODE of\ndy\nthe first order. And since the equation is linear in y (\nis regarded as linear in\ndx\ny) , the equation is called linear. Being linear and of the lowest order possible,\neq. (1.9) can be solved in a closed form, no matter how ugly p(x) and q(x) are.\nIf q = 0, the equation is called homogeneous.\nIf q 6= 0, the equation is called inhomogeneous.\nThe solution of eq. (1.9) with q(x) 6 = 0 is\n\n-P (x)(\nR x\ny(x) = e\n0 e P (x 0 )q(x 0)dx0 + c).\nwhere\nP (x)\nR x p(x 0)dx0 .\n(1.13).\nThe solution has one arbitrary constant.\nProblem for the reader:\nFind a particular solution of the following differential equation:\nx\n(D100 + 1)y = e .\nAnswer:\nThere is more than one way to find a particular solution of this equation,\nbut we advocate doing it in the following way. We treat D as if it were a number\nand get\nx\nyP = D100 + 1 e ,\nwhere yP is a particular solution of the differential equation. By using (1.2)\nwith m = 1 , we get\n1 x\nyP =\ne x = e\n.\n1100 + 1\nExample 2\nFind the general solution of\ny(100) + y = cosh x.\nAnswer\nStep one: we solve the corresponding homogeneous equation\nY (100) + Y = 0 .\nTry\nY = e mx ,\nthen m must satisfy\nm 100 = -1.\n(1.19)\nEquation (1.19) is a polynomial equation which has one hundred roots, which\nwe will denote as mn , n = 1, · · ·100, with\n\n(2n + 1)i\nmn = e\n.\nThus the complementary solution of the present example is\n= c1e m1 x + · · · + c100e m100 x\nY\n.\n(1.20)\nStep two: We find one particular solution of the ODE. We have\nyP =\ncosh x =\n(e x + e -x).\nD100 + 1\nD100 + 1 2\nMaking use of (1.2), we have\nyP =\n(e x + e -x) =\ncosh x .\n(1.21)\n1 + 1 2\nThe most general solution is\ny = yP + Y .\n(1.22)"
