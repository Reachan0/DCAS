  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nIt is recommended that MIT students take\n17.801 Political Science Scope and Methods,\nor get the permission of the instructor.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this class is to introduce undergraduate political scientists to the basic quantitative tools of political science research. In particular, this class explores the key statistically-based research tools that social scientists use to frame and answer empirical questions. When you finish this subject successfully, you will be able to conduct quantitative research, be better able to read critically much of the professional literature in political science and other statistically-based fields, and have an employable skill. The most important purpose behind the political science laboratory, however, is to help you move from a passive reader of social scientific tomes to a creative producer of new insights.\n\nProducing new knowledge, or systematically probing someone else's claims, can be a lot of fun. In order to get to the fun, there is a lot of stuff we have to consider. Consequently, this subject runs on three (roughly) parallel tracks.\n\nLeaving on Track 1 is statistics.\nStatistical reasoning is the most important method of testing hypotheses in the social sciences. Therefore, the statistical introduction offered here forms the core of the subject. The approach I will take to statistics is informal and intuitive. The approach could be more formal and less intuitive, but that would leave us with less time to get on to the new knowledge part. If this subject piques your interest in statistical methods, or if you want a more rigorous treatment of the statistical topics addressed here, consider taking 17.800 (Quantitative Research Methods I) or\n14.32 (Econometrics)\n.\n\nLeaving on Track 2 are research mechanics.\nSerious scholarship requires hard work, organization, and attention to detail. Lots of people have lots of interesting ideas about how the social world works. Some of these ideas are right, others, nuts. In the long run, the researchers who are taken the most seriously and who make the biggest contributions are the ones who get down and dirty with the data. And doing good empirical research involves knowing how libraries work, how to convince people to be interviewed by you, how to type numbers into a computer, how to write code in monster statistical packages, and how to craft a clear English-language sentence. We will therefore spend a good amount of time with the mundane tasks of learning how to use one statistical package (called STATA(r)) and learning how to write papers that follow a specific style book:\n\nTurabian, Kate L.\nA Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations\n. 6th ed. University of Chicago Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780226816272.\n\nLeaving on Track 3 is a project of your own making.\nThere is an old Chinese proverb that says, \"I hear and I forget; I see and I remember; I\ndo\nand\nI understand\n.\" It is this philosophy that drives the Institute's lab requirement, and it is the philosophy that drives this subject. You will be responsible for finding a question that interests you and applying the skills you're learning in this subject toward learning (and understanding) something new. This is the most interesting part of this subject. It can be fun, but it's also much more difficult than it first appears. Because doing original research is so hard, I generally enforce the prerequisite (\n17.869 Political Science Scope and Methods\n). You need to have a good understanding about what political science is and what political scientists do before taking this class. Otherwise, I can guarantee that you will be totally at sea the last half of the semester.\n\nSubject Organization\n\nWe will meet twice each week. During the first half of the semester the primary purpose of these meetings will be to review materials in two formats: lecture and discussion. The subject schedule that is given in the\ncalendar\nsection delineates what will happen each class meeting.\nI expect you to be prepared for each class.\nPreparation will involve different things, depending on what we will be doing in that meeting. During some meetings I will be presenting material from one of the textbooks. For those, you will be expected to have done the textbook reading before the class. I will pay attention to who seems prepared and who is not. If you are unprepared for a particular class meeting, come to class anyway, because I will grade down people who are regularly absent.\n\nDuring the second half of the semester we will meet twice each week to talk about your research projects. You will be required to make two class presentations during this period. At the first presentation, you will be responsible for introducing the class to the problem you wish to address, how you plan to address it, and your preliminary findings. At the second presentation you will be responsible for presenting your findings. These will be brief presentations, probably no more than 15 minutes apiece. Because you will be graded on these presentations, you should practice them beforehand.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass Attendance, Quizzes, and Discussion of Assigned Readings.\n\nSee the comments in the first paragraph of the section on\nSubject Organization\n. Come to all the regularly-scheduled class meetings. Attending the oral presentations that your colleagues give about their research is\nnot\noptional; your constructive participation in these sessions from the perspective of the audience will be a major aspect of this part of the grade. You also will provide brief written feedback on at least two other students' research projects. Finally, there will be a brief assignment about identifying and evaluating causal claims.\n\n20%\n\nData Analysis Exams and Problem Sets.\n\nThere will one short (30-minute), in-class exam, that covers material from the lectures, text book, and problem sets. These are intended to make sure you have been serious about mastering the most basic technical and mechanical aspects of conducting quantitative research.\n\n20%\n\nGroup Project.\n\nThere will be a group project assigned the first month of the semester, to give you a short introduction to doing quantitative social science research. The final product of each project will be graded; with you assigned a grade that is a linear combination of your own effort and the effort of the group.\n\n20%\n\nFinal Research Project.\n\nThe final project is the culmination of this subject. You should start on the first day of the semester in thinking about what you want to research and getting together your data. Keep in mind that there is an old adage about estimating the amount of time it takes to gather and analyze data for an original project: Take your original estimate. Double it. Double it again. And again. You will still be wrong by a factor of two. In writing up your research project, you must organize the paper using a style book, preferably Kate L. Turabian's. The final write-up is due the last day of class. Do not assume that I will grant you an extension. You will also be graded on your two presentations.\n\n40%",

      "content": "Final Project Assignment\n17.871\nSpring 2012\nAssignment summary\nYou will make two oral presentations, of 15 minutes in length, and turn in a final research paper,\n15-20 pages long.\nPresentations\nGeneral considerations. Both presentations will be limited to fifteen minutes, followed by five\nminutes of response from me and others in the class. We will therefore start on time (at 5\nminutes past the hour) and I will cut you off when 15 minutes have elapsed, precisely. Fifteen\nminutes go faster than you imagine. The best presentations will be those that have been\npracticed beforehand. Remember: you will be graded on the quality of your presentations.\n(Indeed, you will be graded more on the presentation itself than on whether you actually found\nanything interesting in your research.)\nIf you have PowerPoint slides to aid in your presentation, e-mail them to me at least an\nhour before the class meeting.\nWhen you are not presenting, you are participating by listening and giving feedback. You must\nbe present for all the presentation sessions.\nFirst presentation. The first presentation should inform us of your subject, how you intend to\npursue it, the data you plan to use, and any special problems you think you will encounter.\nInform us of your subject: What is the substantive issue you intend to pursue? What is the key\npuzzle or question you wish to address. To whom would the issue be of interest? Have others\nresearched this area before? If so, what have they found?\nHow do you intend to pursue the subject: What are your major dependent variables (focus on one\nor two). What are your major independent variables? What \"unit of analysis\" will you be\nstudying? (That is, will you be studying individuals, counties, countries, etc.?) Will this be a\ntime series analysis? Cross-sectional? A combination?\nYour data: What would the ideal data be to do this project? If you can't get your ideal data,\nwhat data can you get your hands on? Tell us actual sources. It would also be good at this point\nto report descriptive statistics of your data set, graphs that show simple, basic relationships, etc.\nSpecial problems. Perhaps there's a crucial variable that will be difficult or impossible to\nmeasure directly, or some regression assumption will be violated. Quantitative analysis is rarely\nstraightforward, so tell us any wrinkles you've encountered thus far, or anticipate encountering\nover the next month.\n\nSecond presentation. The second presentation should summarize the basics of your first\npresentation and then report your findings. The summary of the first presentation should be very\nbrief, focusing on reminding us of the subject you are pursuing, your basic approach, and the\nsource(s) of your data. Your findings should be reported in much the way we learned data\nanalysis in this subject. First, present your data. Identify the variables in your analysis: how are\nthey measured, what are their means and dispersions? Second, present the most important\nbivariate relationships. This may be done either with a correlation matrix or with a series of well\nthought-out graphs. Third, present your multivariate analysis. Draw to our attention the core\nresults and whether they confirm or disconfirm your orginal conjectures. Discuss any cases that\nappear to be poorly described by your analysis and what might be done to correct this. Fourth,\ntell us what you conclude about your subject from the analysis you've done.\nResearch paper\nThe logic of exposition in your research paper should roughly parallel the second presentation.\nThe one section you should add at the beginning of the paper that you won't want to talk too\nmuch about in the second presentation is a discussion of previous research. While you don't\nhave to do a comprehensive search of the literature, you need to do a little library work to see if\nanyone has written about your topic before and (if they did) what they found. Don't worry if\nyou've found that someone has previously done something identical to your project. Replication\nof others' results is an important part of normal science.\nJournal articles in political science (which is the model your write-up should follow) often\nfollow this outline:\nI.\nIntroduction\nII.\nLiterature review\nIII.\nData\nIV.\nModel specification (i.e., what are the variables and how are they measured?)\nV.\nResults\nA.\nPreliminary results (simple relationships and a first cut at multivariate\nanalysis)\nB.\nSensitivity analysis and other searches for anomalies\nC.\nRe-estimation; further analysis\nVI.\nDiscussion of results from a substantive perspective\nVII.\nConclusion\nThe first page (after the title page) must have an abstract of no more than 250 words that\nsummarizes your project and findings. The abstract page must contain your name and the title of\nyour paper.\n\nThe paper should be about 20 pages long, including text, graphs, figures, appendices, and\nbibliography. There is no hard and fast page limit for the final page. Write succinctly. Edit.\nHone. Eschew verbiage. Make the text flow. If there's a particularly long, involved\nmethodological problem that you attend to, consider moving it to an appendix and only make\nreference to it in the body of the paper.\nRead Kate Turabian's style book (A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and\nDissertations) before you write your final draft. Follow this style book for most things. In\naddition, the American Political Science Review's style sheet is the authority for special cases\nthat pertain to political science. Look at recent editions of the American Political Science\nReview or American Journal of Political Science to see how tables and figures should appear.\nFinally, there are some mechanical issues that you must attend to in writing ths paper. (Indeed,\nyou should always attend to these issues when writing for the social sciences.) If you do not\nfollow these strictures, your paper will be returned to you for rewriting, possibly resulting in\nyour receiving an I for the subject. When you turn in your final paper, you will need to include a\ncheck-list indicating that you have made sure it meets these criteria.\nDouble-space everything, except footnotes and tables.\nUse footnotes, not endnotes.\nUse the author-date form of citation.\nProperly number the pages (page 1 is the first text page).\nInclude figures and tables at the end of your paper, consecutively numbered. (Include all\nthe figures first, then the tables.) Make explicit reference to each table and figure in the\nbody of the text.\nDon't use fancy fonts.. Make sure the font size is no smaller than 10pt and no larger than\n12pt. Never use bold face. Use underscoring or italics for emphasis, book titles, etc.\nUse a constant 1\" margin on each page.\nTables and figures should be self-explanatory.\nStaple the paper in the upper left-hand corner. Don't use a report cover. (Electronic\nversions of papers are now preferred.)\n\nWhat you will hand in\nAccording to the regulations of the faculty, all final papers are due on the last day of this class.\nThat means by 11:59pm. Any extensions must be approved beforehand.\nTo receive a grade in this class you must produce the following:\nEmail a copy of your paper to the TA and me. The version should be either in pdf or\nMicrosoft Word format.\nCompleted checklist form. Indicate to me in the e-mail that you have met all of the\nmechanical criteria of the paper that are on the checklist.\nYour data and the STATA code capable of reproducing the results you report. See below\nfor further instructions about this.\nIf any of these elements is missing, you will receive an I.\nHow to turn in your data\nFor the benefit of future students in 17.871, to assist me in giving you feedback, and in the\ninterest of scientific replication, you are required to turn in the data you use to produce the\nresults in your paper, plus the computer code used to generate the results. Here's what you have\nto produce.\nData. If you gather the data yourself, you must make available to me the computer file of that\ndata. You must also make available a \"codebook\" that identifies the variables: (1) variable\nname, (2) data source, (3) column location of the variable in the file, and (4) any coding rules\nyou used to create the variable. If you used a data set produced by someone else, such as an\nICPSR data set, you must tell me the full citation of the data set. If it is not an ICPSR data set,\nand it is not available through the MIT-Harvard Data Center, we will treat it like you gathered\nthe data yourself.\nSTATA code. You must save the STATA code from the \".do files\" that produced the results\nyou report in your paper. Give the code a file name that corresponds with the results reported in\nyour paper (e.g., table1.do, figure2.do).\nYou will then e-mail the data to me, as an attachment. If the data is too large to e-mail, let us\nknow and we'll work out something.\n\n17.871 Final Paper Checklist\nDouble-spaced, except footnotes and tables.\nFootnotes used, not endnotes\nAuthor-date citation form used\nPage numbers properly used\nProper font.\nEither 10pt or 12pt.\nItalics or underscore used for emphasis.\nBold is never used.\nCourier or Times/Times New Roman typeface.\nConstant 1\" margin on each page\nPaper stapled in the upper left-hand corner. No report covers.\nCoefficients and other statistics in tables (like regression coefficients and standard errors)\nhave no more than 3 significant digits.\nNo STATA output dumped into the text of the paper.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n17.871 Political Science Laboratory\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "17.871\nSpring 2012\nGroup Projects\n\nAssignment summary\n\nWorking with your assigned group, answer the question posed to you. You will give a 20-\nminute presentation (with 5 minutes available for questions) on your work on March 12. Your\ngroup will also turn in a nine-page written report on your project on Friday, March 16. (Please\ne-mail a copy to me by 5:00 pm., in one of the following formats: doc, wpf, or pdf.) The report\nshould be in the form of a (mini) term paper meaning, among other things, that it should follow\nthe format described by Kate Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and\nDissertations. The paper should do the following:\n\n1. State, or re-state, the question, and discuss to whom the question is important and why.\n2. Review any relevant literature you can find, either in journals or books.\n3. Describe your method, including, how you measured the variables of interest (dependent and\nindependent variables) and where you gathered the data.\n4. Summarize your findings, using the appropriate figures and tables.\n\nThe nine page limit includes tables, figures, and bibliography.\n\nStatement about Collaboration\n\nYou are encouraged to seek and extend as much help as you can, both within and between groups. I\nexpect you to be meticulous in citing the written work of others that you use.\n\nGrading\n\nI will assign a letter grade to each group's project. That will be the grade you receive, plus or minus an\nadjustment that will be determined as follows: I will ask each member of the group to indicate the\nrelative amount of effort each person contributed to the successful completion of the project. If\nsomeone in the group stands out as being a conspicuous over- or under-contributor to the group effort,\nthat person's letter grade will be adjusted upward or downward as appropriate.\n\nProject 1: Electoral Systems and the Quality of Representation\n\nBackground: Democratic countries the world over employ a wide variety of electoral systems. Citizens\nof democratic countries vary in how responsive they believe their leaders are to their desires. A natural\nquestion arises about whether some electoral systems are better than others in transmitting the voices of\ncitizens to the ears of elected officials. This question is intrinsically interesting, but it has practical\nimplications, since reformers the world over often try to change the local electoral system in order to\nmake it more \"responsive\" to the people. In particular, it is commonly believed that systems that have\nmore parties from which to choose and that employ some form of proportional representation are more\nresponsive to citizen demands.\n\nQuestion: Do citizens from countries with more political parties and that employ proportional\nrepresentation in their legislative elections feel that their voices are heard more than citizens from\ncountries with few parties and that employ plurality voting for legislatures?\n\nPossible explanations\n- Multi-partyism. The more parties a country has, the more they are able to populate the full array\nof possible issue positions. This gives voters more of a reason to believe their voices are heard\nin the parliament.\n- Proportional representation. Proportional representation (PR) systems allocate seats in the\nlegislature in proportion to the votes received throughout a geographic region, in contract to\nplurality systems, which allocate seats on a \"winner take all\" basis. Under this system, minority\nviews are presumed to be more likely to be represented in the legislature.\n- Individual demographics and partisanship. Certain types of people may be happier with\ngoverning institutions than others, despite the electoral system. Sometimes this will be a\nfunction of local political factors. For instance, left-leaning people in a country controlled by a\nliberal party may be less likely to believe the parliament is \"fair\" than conservative people.\n\nData sources\n- Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. This is a cross-national survey that asked an identical\nbattery of questions to citizens in several dozen countries and is available through its own web\nsite (http://www.umich.edu/~cses/). There are individual reports that document the political and\npartisan context of each country included in the project.\n\nBibliographic sources\n- Christopher J. Anderson and Christine A. Guillory. 1997. \"Political Institutions and Satisfaction\nwith Democracy: A Cross-National Analysis of Consensus and Majoritarian Systems.\"\nAmerican Political Science Review 91: 66-81.\n- Anderson, C., Blais, A., Donovan, T., Listhaug, O., Bowler, S. 2005. Losers' consent: Elections\nand democratic legitimacy. Oxford: Oxford University Press.\n\nComments/hints: This project will involve the use of a large, unwieldy data set (the CSES), merging it\nwith information gathered from other sources. You will want to meditate on whether the questions\nasked in the different countries actually mean the same thing, across different languages and cultures.\nPick one variable as your key explanatory variable, treating other variables as controls.\n\nProject 2: Unfamiliar Names and Congressional Elections\n\nQuestion: In House elections, many voters know nothing other than the candidates' names and party\naffiliations. Does having a less familiar name hurt candidates in House elections?\n\nPossible Explanations\n- Incumbency. Incumbents tend to fare better than do challengers so you may consider controlling\nfor incumbency.\n- District partisanship. Districts tend to be stable in their partisanship, which researchers often\nmeasure with the average tendency to vote Democratic in recent presidential elections.\n- Ethnicity. You may wish to control for or exclude races where one or both candidates have\n\"ethnic\" last names.\n\nData sources\n- Census Bureau. Data on the frequency of names in the United States is available through the\nCensus Bureau, e.g., http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/index.html\n- Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. ICPSR has biographical data on\ncandidates for house elections, as well as election results.\n- United States Congress, Congressional Directory. This guide to members of the House and\nSenate includes election returns for every congressional district and state.\n\nProject 3: U.S. Foreign Aid and Voting in the United Nations\n\nQuestion: Why do some countries vote with the U.S. in the United Nations General Assembly, and\nothers do not?\n\nPossible explanations:\n- Democracies stick together. The U.S., as the \"leader of the free world,\" is able to pull along\ncoalitions that are predominantly democratic.\n- Reliance on U.S. foreign aid. Nations that receive foreign assistance from the U.S. are more\nlikely to support the U.S. position.\n- \"Anti-Americanism\": Public opinion in some countries is less favorable to the U.S. than in\nothers. Knowing this, representatives of these countries to the U.N. will vote against the U.S.\nposition more often.\n\nData sources:\n- \"United Nations General Assembly Voting Data.\" Compiled by Erik Voeten and Adis\nMerdzanovic and online at http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/12379.\n- Freedom House. An organization that annually issues a report detailing how free each country\nin the world is. (Note: A simple literature search will uncover many different \"democracy\" and\n\"freedom\" data sets out there.)\n- Statistical Abstract of the United States. This nifty data source includes tables that detail\nforeign assistance given to every country on earth, for many years.\n\nComments/hints: First, there is the issue of measuring support. This could be a dichotomous variable\n(vote with the US/not with the US), a continuous variable that measures when a country supported, or\nanother variable that takes into account the \"importance\" of different votes\" Second, the possible\nexplanations require some refinement. Many of the proposed explanations don't have \"natural\"\nindicators, so you need to think hard about how to measure them and finding the data.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n17.871 Political Science Laboratory\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Also, attach a Stata do-file and your data file that will reproduce the analysis you\nreport.\n\nGrading rubric\n\nThe following is the distribution of points for how the assignment will be graded:\n\n- Writing/Organization - 30 points\n- Lit. Review - 15 points\n- Data Collection - 15 points\n- Data Analysis - 20 points\n- Data Presentation - 20 points\nPresentation\nYou should be able to make your presentation using five slides. Here they are:\n\n1. Research question\nPose your question\nWhat is the current state of academic thinking about your question?\nDevelop a hypothesis about one key explanatory variable\nExplain why it's important to democracy, public policy, etc.\n2. Research design (methodology: usually regression)\nDescribe dependent variable, key explanatory variable, control variables (justify the\ncontrols)\nDescriptive statistics (recode all to 0-1, present means and sds)\n3. Bivariate relationship for key variable\nScatter plot for continuous variables, box plots or crosstabs for nominal variables,\nlabel axes, label data points\n\n□\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n17.871 Political Science Laboratory\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Briefly, look up and describe one or\ntwo studies on your causal claim. You can choose causal claims about politics or about humans\nmore generally. (E.g., \"McCain lost because he was too old\" or \"People get sick because of cold\nweather.\") Turn the paragraph into me at the beginning of class and be prepared for a brief\ndiscussion about your causal claim.\n\nIn your paragraph, briefly answer the following questions:\n1. What is the causal claim? That is, what x is causing what y?\n2. What have researchers found? Check Google scholar, etc.\n3. Did researchers use experimental studies? Or are the studies merely observational?\n4. Are there any obvious problems with the studies?\n\nYour causal claim must be at least somewhat widely believed and non-trivial. If in doubt, search\nfor it using a search engine or peruse skeptic.com or snopes.com.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n17.871 Political Science Laboratory\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "17.871\nSpring 2012\nHow to Use the STATA infile and infix Commands\nSTATA is a very flexible program, allowing you to read-in and manipulate data in many different\nforms. This is good, because social science data come in various formats, requiring great\nflexibility among the statistical packages social scientists use. Unfortunately, the STATA manual\nwe are using only covers how to input the simplest of data sets. The simplicity of the examples in\nthat book border on the trivial. The purpose of this handout, therefore, is to introduce you to the\nuse of the STATA infile and infix commands, going a little more in depth than the Hamilton book\ngoes.\nAn easy case\nLet us say that you have data about four students who have taken a standardized test. You have\ntheir first names, their ages, and their scores on two tests (Test 1 and Test 2). Here are the data in\ntabular form:\nName\nAge\nTest 1\nTest 2\nBob\nCarol\nTed\nAlice\nThe easiest way to get these data into STATA is for you to fire up the STATA Data Editor and\njust type the data into the spreadsheet-like interface.\nThe next-easiest way to get the data into STATA is for you to type the data into a file and then let\nSTATA read it in. Let's say your Athena username is janedoe. You could create a data file using\na text editor such as EMACS. Let's say you saved the data in a file in your directory named\nscores.dat. The file scores.dat looks like the following.1\nExhibit 1\nBob 18 95 18\nCarol 21 43 27\nTed 14 67 9\nAlice 12 23 31\nThen, from within STATA you would type the following:\n1Note that all files that STATA reads must end with a carriage return.\n*\n* Athena is MIT's UNIX-based computing environment. OCW does not provide access to it.\n\ninfile str5 name age test1 test2 using /mit/janedoe/scores.dat\nThe word infile is the command name. The words name, age, test1, and test2 are the variable\nnames. STATA variable names must be 32 characters long,2 or shorter, and begin with a\nletter or underscore (_). STATA generally assumes that variables contain numbers. If the data\nare not numeric, STATA needs to be told that a variable is non-numeric (a text \"string\") and the\nlongest the text string can be. That is the function of the word str5 before the word name: to\nspecify that name is a text string that may be no longer than 5 characters long.\nAfter you have typed in the infile command, you should then issue the compress command. That\nis because STATA has some tricky memory management problems, and this command will\nconvert all the variables to their most efficient internal representations.\nAn example with fixed field data\nThe above example is the simplest case of reading in data for use by STATA. In addition to being\na short, narrow data set, we are able to express this data set using what we call a \"free form\"\nformat: the data are just freely typed into the computer, with nothing but a space to separate\nvariable values. Data sets are rarely this simple. For instance, if you had someone with a first\nname of \"Mary Jane\" you would have to get rid of the space (by typing in something like\nMaryJane or Mary_Jane). If you had thousands of observations (instead of four) and variables\n(instead of four) the spaces necessary to delimit individual observations might cause the data set\nto balloon beyond what is really necessary to contain the unique information among the data. For\nthese, and other, reasons, data sets are typically organized using a \"fixed format\". With fixed\nformat organization, each line begins a new observation3 and each variable occupies the same\ncolumn(s) on each line.\nThe fixed format version of the data would look something like the following:\nExhibit 2\nBob 189518\nCarol214327\nTed 1467 9\nAlice122331\nTo read in this data, you would use the STATA infix command. This is what you would type to\nread in the data from Exhibit 2:\ninfix str5 name 1-5 age 6-7 test1 8-9 test2 10-11 using scores.dat\n2Earlier versions of STATA (i.e., versions 6 and earlier) limited variable names to 8\ncharacters in length. I often maintain that convention, for compatibility reasons and for brevity.\n3There are important exceptions that will be dealt with below.\n\nA word about missing data\nSometimes data will be missing from a data set. There are three ways of indicating missing data\nin STATA: (1) the lone period, (2) missing value codes, and (3) blanks.\nThe lone period\nSTATA generally represents missing values with a lone period where the value of the variable\nshould be. For instance, say that Ted would not tell us his age. We could account for this fact by\nplacing a period where his age should go, either in free form:\nBob 18 95 18\nCarol 21 43 27\nTed . 67 9\nAlice 12 23 31\nor in fixed format:\nBob 189518\nCarol214327\nTed\n.67 9\nAlice122331\nSTATA would then exclude Ted from any calculations or procedures that required the use of the\nage variable.\nMissing value codes\nMost social science data sets use missing value codes to indicate missing values. It is most\ncommon to give someone an impossible value for that variable when the variable's true value is\nmissing, and then to tell the statistical program about that value. So, for instance, ages must be\npositive. Therefore, we could make the value of -1 indicate a missing age, give Ted an age of -1,\nand then tell STATA what we've done. The data would look like this:\nBob 189518\nCarol214327\nTed -167 9\nAlice122331\nThere are then two ways to change a missing value code into an actual missing value\nrepresentation in STATA. The most general way is to use the replace command:\nreplace age=. if age== -1\n\nThe above command tells STATA to replace values of age with the missing value representation\nin those cases where age equals -1.\nThis technique can get tedious if you have lots of variables with the same missing value code.\nSTATA has a command, mvdecode, which converts missing values to their proper representation.\nFor instance, if age, test1, and test2 all used -1 for missing data, you could issue the following\nsingle command to accommodate the missing values:\nmvdecode age test1 test2, mv(-1)\nYou can use up to 27 different missing value codes. For instance, let's say you're working on a\npublic opinion survey. One question asks if the person voted for president in the last election.\nThe next question asks for whom the respondent voted, but only if the person reported in the\nprevious question that she had voted for president. In this case, you will have missing data on\nthe second question, for at least two reasons--the respondent may have not voted or the\nrespondent may have voted, but then refused to tell you for whom. You might give the \"not\napplicables\" the missing value code of -8 and the \"refusals\" the missing value code of -9.\nSTATA now allows you to collapse these different missing value cases into one, or maintain\nthem in the data set. For instance, the command\nmvdecode presvote, mv(-8 -9)\nwill turn values of -8 and -9 to the default missing value symbol \".\" (period). On the other hand,\nthe command\nmvdecode presvote, mv (-8 = .a -9=.b)\nwill translate values of -8 to the \"extended missing value code\" of .a and values of -9 to the\nextended missing value code of .b. For most statistical operations, the effect of the two\ncommand is the same. However, if you later want to go back and do analysis on the missing\ncategories themselves (say, you're interested in why people refuse to state a preference for\npresident), then you can recover the original data.\nSometimes, if you have a long list of missing value codes and you don't want to maintain the\ndifferent codes internally, there's a less tedious replace command that will accomplish the same\nthing as the first mvdecode command. For instance, the command\nreplace presvote = . if presvote <= -8\nproduces precisely the same result as\nmvdecode presvote, mv(-8 -9)\n\nBlanks\nIf STATA encounters a blank in a fixed field formatted data set where a variable should be, it\ninterprets that value of the variable as missing. (Question: Why won't this work with free format\ndata?) So, in this example, the following fixed field data set would also indicate that Ted's age is\nmissing:\nBob 189518\nCarol214327\nTed\n67 9\nAlice122331\nWhich is the best way to indicate missing values?\nYou should get in the habit of indicating missing values with missing value codes, rather than\nusing blanks or relying on the lone period. Using blanks is an invitation to sloppiness and errors.\nThe lone period is fine in STATA, but not all statistical packages (or high-level programming\nlanguages) use the same missing value symbol. Also, the period may be mistaken for a legitimate\ndecimal point, leading to further errors.\nMulti-record data sets\nTypically, data files contain only one line of data for each observation (or case). There are times,\nhowever, when you have so much data about each observation that it won't fit (legibly) on a\nsingle line. In those cases you must be explicit to STATA in telling it how many data lines\nconstitute a case, or you will be in deep trouble.\nImagine that the data set we've been using put name, age, and the test scores on one line, but then\nput GPA on the second line, like this:\nExhibit 3\nBob 189518\n3.35\nCarol214327\n2.97\nTed -167 9\n0.75\nAlice122331\n4.00\n(Ted's age is still missing.) Notice that the variables still occupy the same columns each time, it's\njust that each individual's data also occupies two lines. You deal with reading \"multiple records\nper case\" by modifying the infix command in two ways. First, you need to tell infix how many\n\nlines of data constitute each observation. Second, you need to specify the line on which each\nvariable may be found.\nThe following is the command you would issue to read in the data from Exhibit 3:\ninfix 2 lines 1: str5 name 1-5 age 6-7 test1 8-9 test2 10-11 2: gpa 1-4\nThe phrase \"2 lines\" indicates that each observation consists of two lines of data. \"1: str5 ...\ntest2 10-11\" indicates the variables that are found on the first line. Likewise, \"2: gpa 1-4\"\nindicates that the variable gpa is on the second line, in columns 1-4.\nNote that you don't have to read variables from each line. So, for instance, if you didn't have\nneed for the gpa variable in the analysis you were doing, you could just type:\ninfix 2 lines 1: str5 name 1-5 age 6-7 test1 8-9 test2 10-11\nand just skip over the second line.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n17.871 Political Science Laboratory\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "17.871\nHow to Use the STATA merge and reshape commands\nMost of the projects done in 17.871, and in fact most interesting research, require combining\ndata sets. This handout reviews using the most valuable command for managing multiple data\nsets, the merge command. In addition, we are often interested in combining multiple\nobservations from some unit of analysis (like countries or states or people) to create a panel data\nset. The reshape command helps to move between different organizations of the data.\nThe merge command\nLet us say we are researching the effect of using different voting equipment on the tendency of\nvoters to cast \"blank\" or \"spoiled\" ballots (that is, to record no vote, or to record multiple votes).\nOne data set might record the number of votes cast and the number of blank ballots in each town.\nHere is an example:\nExhibit 1. ballots.dta\ntown\nblank92 ballot92\nblank96\nballot96\nBarnstable\nBourne\nBrewster\nChatham\nDennis\nEastham\nFalmouth\nHarwich\nMashpee\nOrleans\nProvincetown\nSandwich\nTruro\nWellfleet\nYarmouth\nThe variable town identifies a town (duh!), blank92 and blank96 record the number of blank\nballots in these town for 1992 and 1996, and ballot92 and ballot96 record the total number of\nballots cast in the town. Let us suppose we have saved this data set in the file ballots.dta\nAnother data set might record the ballot method used in the town, like this:\n\nExhibit 2. machines.dta\ntown\nmethod92 method96\nBarnstable\nPaper\nAccuVote\nBourne\nAccuVote AccuVote\nBrewster\nOptech\nOptech\nChatham\nPaper\nOptech\nDennis\nOptech\nOptech\nEastham\nPaper\nOptech\nFalmouth\nPaper\nAccuVote\nHarwich\nOptech\nOptech\nMashpee\nPaper\nOptech\nOrleans\nOptech\nOptech\nProvincetown\nPaper\nPaper\nSandwich\nOptech\nOptech\nTruro\nPaper\nPaper\nWellfleet\nPaper\nPaper\nYarmouth\nOptech\nOptech\nAs before, town is the town. The variables method92 and method96 record the type of voting\ndevice the town used in 1992 and 1996, respectively. The data are saved in machines.dta.\nNotice the following important point: Both ballots.dta and machines.dta have a common\nvariable, town, which uniquely identifies the cases. (In this example, the town name identifies\nthe cases. For larger, more complex cases, it is often advisable to use a numerical variable as the\njoint identifier.)\nTo merge two data sets, follow these steps:\n(1)\nSort both data sets on the common identifying variable and save them to disk\nsorted.\n(2)\nUse one of the data sets.\n(3)\nIssue the merge command, using the following syntax:\nmerge commonvariable using remotefilename\nThis set of commands will augment the data set you had used (in step 2), by adding the variables\nfrom the remote file. In addition, a new variable will be created, called _merge. The variable\n_merge will be equal to 3 if the case was in both data sets, 1 if the case was in the \"master\" data\nset (i.e., the one used in step 2) but not in the \"using\" data set, and 2 if the case was in the\n\"using\" data set but not originally in the \"master\" data set.\nSo, the following commands\nuse ballots\nsort town\nsave ballots,replace\nuse machines\nsort town\nsave machines,replace\n\nuse ballots\nmerge town using machines\nwould produce the following data set:\nExhibit 3. Merged data set\ntown\nblank92 ballot92\nblank96\nballot96\nmethod92 method96 _merge\nBarnstable\n22467 Paper\nAccuVote\nBourne\n8032 AccuVote AccuVote\nBrewster\n5498 Optech\nOptech\nChatham\n4475 Paper\nOptech\nDennis\n8493 Optech\nOptech\nEastham\n3151 Paper\nOptech\nFalmouth\n16224 Paper\nAccuVote\nHarwich\n6737 Optech\nOptech\nMashpee\n4962 Paper\nOptech\nOrleans\n4229 Optech\nOptech\nProvincetown\n2268 Paper\nPaper\nSandwich\n9757 Optech\nOptech\nTruro\n1156 Paper\nPaper\nWellfleet\n1768 Paper\nPaper\nYarmouth\n12710 Optech\nOptech\nThe _merge variable confirms that we brought in a balanced set of cases from both data sets. (In\nother words, it confirms that there aren't towns that we have election returns for that we don't\nhave voting equipment data for, and vice versa.) However, it's a nuisance variable once the\nmerge has been successfully completed, so it's a good idea to drop it once you've satisfied\nyourself that everything is OK.\nThe reshape command\nThe data set shown in Exhibit 3 could be used to analyze the rate of ballot blanking in 1992 and\n1996, separately, as a function of voting technology used. And, it could be used to study the\nchange in ballot blanking from 1992 to 1996, as a function of the change in voting technology.\nHowever, we might also want to treat the data set as consisting of 30 town-year observations,\nrather than 15 separate town observations. To do this, I would want to \"stack up\" the different\ntown observations, having the 1992 variables for blanks, ballots, and method appearing first (and\nidentified according to year), followed by the 1996 variables for blanks, ballots and method (also\nidentified according to year). We can do this using the reshape command.\nNotice first the naming convention I adopted in the above data sets: each substantive variable\nname consists of a stem (blank or ballot) followed by the year in question (92 or 96).\nThen, the following command\nreshape long blank ballot method, i(town) j(year)\n\nwill \"reshape\" the Exhibit 3 data set as follows:\nExhibit 4. Reshaped, merged data set\ntown\nblank\nballot\nmethod year\nBarnstable\n22747 Paper\nBourne\n7885 AccuVote\nBrewster\n5480 Optech\nChatham\n4558 Paper\nDennis\n8732 Optech\nEastham\n3013 Paper\nFalmouth\n16377 Paper\nHarwich\n6741 Optech\nMashpee\n4619 Paper\nOrleans\n4251 Optech\nProvincetown\n2488 Paper\nSandwich\n9151 Optech\nTruro\n1161 Paper\nWellfleet\n1815 Paper\nYarmouth\n12862 Optech\nBarnstable\n22467 AccuVote\nBourne\n8032 AccuVote\nBrewster\n5498 Optech\nChatham\n4475 Optech\nDennis\n8493 Optech\nEastham\n3151 Optech\nFalmouth\n16224 AccuVote\nHarwich\n6737 Optech\nMashpee\n4962 Optech\nOrleans\n4229 Optech\nProvincetown\n2268 Paper\nSandwich\n9757 Optech\nTruro\n1156 Paper\nWellfleet\n1768 Paper\nYarmouth\n12710 Optech\nWe now have a new data set with twice as many observations as before: each town has two\nobservations, one for 1992 and the other for 1996. For each town-year observation, we have the\nnumber of blanks, total number of ballots, and the voting method used for that observation.\nThe command\nreshape wide blank ballot method, i(town) j(year)\nwill reverse the procedure, restoring the data set to Exhibit 3 (without _merge).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n17.871 Political Science Laboratory\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Stata Handout\n\n1. Starting Stata\n\nIf you use Stata for Windows, starting Stata is straightforward. You just have to double-click on the\nwstata (or stata) icon.\n\nIf you use Stata for Unix, type at the athena command prompt:\n\nathena% add stata\nathena% xstata\n\nThen four windows will appear on your monitor. You will type your commands in the Stata Command\nwindow. The Review window records your commands and the Variables window lists the variables in\nyour data set (including the one that you created).\n\n2. Do-files\n\nProblem sets usually require you to turn in your do-file. Do-files simply contain commands that you want\nStata to execute. Without do-files, you have to type a command, wait for an execution, and then type\nanother command. This can be inconvenient once your commands become more elaborate. In addition, it\nis important to create do-files to keep track of what you did. If you don't have a do-file when you want to\nrepeat the same analysis again or modify your past analysis, you will have to type the same commands\nagain.\n\nThe way do-files work is very easy: we first create a file that contains all the commands that Stata should\nexecute, and then tell Stata to execute them. So we are just telling Stata what to do all in advance,\ninstead of one by one.\n*\n*\n*\n*Athena is MIT's UNIX-based computing environment. OCW does not provide access to it.\n\nTo create a do-file, click on the do file button or type\n\ndoedit\n\nThen you will see a simple text file. When you finish entering commands, save the do-file. Here you\nshould make sure it is saved in the current directly. Stata looks for data and do-files in the current\ndirectory and save new data files there. You can find the location of the current directory at the bottom left\nhand corner of the window (something like C:\\Data in Windows). You can change the location of the\ncurrent directory by the cd command, as in cd temp, for example (assuming that you have already\ncreated a folder called temp in Data directory). When you have finished typing your code, you can run it\nby selecting it and hitting the do button. You can run the entire file by typing\n\ndo filename\n\nfilename can be any name. Do-files have .do as an extension, but .do is assumed when you enter do or\ndoedit, so you don't have to explicitly spell out your filename as do sample.do; do sample is sufficient. If\nyou want to modify your do-file, type doedit filename.\n\n3. Log files\n\nYou can record all results that appear in the Results window in a log file. There are two versions of log-\nfiles: one is Stata formatted (smcl) and another one is a text file. You can read log-files written in smcl\nonly in the viewer of Stata and smcl-style logs contain some annoying style, so I recommend that you use\na text file version of log-file. To start recording your output, type\n\nlog using filename.log\n\nTyping .log at the end is important. If you don't add the extension, Stata creates smcl-style log files.\nWhen you are done with the analysis, type\n\nlog close\n\nOf course, you can include these commands (log using...and log close) in your do-file. When you do so,\nit is safe to enter log using ..., replace (see below). Alternatively, you can start a log, then run your do-\nfile that does not contain the log using.. command.\n\nIf you make a mistake in your do-file and receive an error message, Stata stops the procedures. Stata\ndoes not automatically close the log, so if this happens, close the log first (you can check if the log is\nopen by looking at the bottom of the Stata Results window - if it's open, it says log on) and then type\n\nlog using filename.log, replace\n\nThis command overwrites the existing log file. In some cases, you may want to add more results to the\nexisting log file. Then you should make sure the log is closed and type\n\nlog using filename.log, append\n\nSince text log-files are just text files, you can read and print them using text editors (such as emacs in\nUnix or Notepad in Windows). Log files are stored in the current directly.\n\n4. Some Additional Commands\n\nSome basic commands that you use to do Problem set 2 are included in the questions. Here are some other\ncommands and facts that you may need to know.\n\n(1) Creating variables\n\nTo create a variable, type\n\ngen varname=expression\n\nFor example, to create a standard normal variable and call it x,\n\ngen x=invnorm(uniform())\n\nNote that, obviously, you cannot create a variable that has the same name as the existing variable.\nSuppose that you first set the number of observations to 50 and then create a variable called x by typing\ngen x=invnorm(uniform()). You are done with obs=50, so you change the number of observation to 100\n(set obs 100) and again type gen x=invnorm(uniform()), then you will get an error message. In this\ncase, you have three options: (1) clear the data, (2) remove variable x, or (3) or explicitly tell Stata to\ncreate a new variable with the same name (i.e. overwrite x). To do (1), use command clear (see below).\nTo do (2), just type drop x. In order to do (3) (i.e. when you want to overwrite x), type replace\nx=invnorm(uniform()).\n\n(2) Checking the data\n\nWhen you want to see the variable that you created, type\n\nbr\n\n(equivalent to typing browse).\n\n(3) Clearing the memory and dropping variables\n\nOnce you are done with the data, you can clear the data. To do so, type\n\nclear\n\nNote that this will erase all the variables in the data. If you want to remove some variables in the data and\nkeep all the other variables, type\n\ndrop varname\n\n(4) Graphs\n\nTo draw a graph and save it, type\n\nhistogram varname, saving(graphname, replace) [Stata 8]\n\nFor example, if the name of the variable is x and if you want to call the graph graph1, the above\ncommand would look like;\n\nhistogram x, bin(100) normal saving(graph1, replace)\n\nI would add replace in saving(..) for the same reason that replace is added in the log using.. command.\nThe normal command adds a nice normal curve and is optional. The bin( ) command is also optional and\nyou can specify different numbers. You probably want to add the bin( ) command only when the sample\nsize is very large and the graph does not look very smooth. (Note that in Stata 7, you can increase your\nbin only up to 50.)\n\nTo look at the graph after your do-file is done,\n\ngraph use graph1 [Stata 8]\n\nNote that depending on the version of Stata, you have to use a slightly different command. To print the\ngraph, click on the File in the header bar (when the graph is still open) and then choose Print Graph.\n\n(5) Exiting Stata\n\nWhen you are done, make sure your data is cleared (clear), then just type exit.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n17.871 Political Science Laboratory\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
