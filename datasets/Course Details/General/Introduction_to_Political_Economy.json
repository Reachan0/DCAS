Now predictability matters a lot:\nTheorem\nSuppose that in each period there is a majority of voters who are certain\nnot to be the next proposer. Then in every MPE the current proposer gets\nthe entire surplus.\nTo guarantee equitable division of rents among legislators, it is not\nenough that get to propose equally often. You also need\nunpredictability, to prevent the current proposer from targeting\nweaker members.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 11\nOctober 16, 2017.\n17 / 53\n\nEconomic Policy under Representative Democracy\nLegislative Bargaining\nPredictability and Power: Example\nSuppose players A, B, and C rotate in making offers.\nExistence of equilibrium where proposer gets everything:\nWhen A proposer, A and C willing to give everything to A.\nWhen B proposer, B and A willing to give everything to B.\nWhen C proposer, C and B willing to give everything to C.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 11\nOctober 16, 2017.\n18 / 53\n\nEconomic Policy under Representative Democracy\nLegislative Bargaining\nPredictability and Power: Example\nUniqueness:\nSuppose there's a MPE where A offers ε > 0 to either B or C.\nThen C's vote must cost at least ε.\nC's vote costs at least ε iff B gives her at least ε/δ in period 1 with\npositive probability.\nThen A's vote must also cost at least ε/δ in period 1.\nBut A's vote costs at least ε/δ in period 1 iff C gives her at least\nε/δ2 in period 2 with positive probability.\nBy induction someone's vote costs at least ε/δt in period t with\npositive probability, for all t.\nBut only $1 to go around, so this is impossible.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 11\nOctober 16, 2017.\n19 / 53\n\nEconomic Policy under Representative Democracy\nThe Effects of Political Institutions\nThe Effects of Political Institutions\nSo far we examined models of democracy with few institutional\ndetails.\nBut some of these details matter (and we have seen a preview of that\nin legislative bargaining).\nOne set of important institutional arrangements that matter for how\ndemocracy works are about separation of powers - the distribution\nof powers between legislatures and presidents (and beyond).\nWe now discuss a very simple model of this due to Persson, Tabellini\nand Roland (1997, 2000).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 11\nOctober 16, 2017.\n20 / 53\n\nEconomic Policy under Representative Democracy\nThe Effects of Political Institutions\nA Model of Political Public Finance\ninf\n∑\nThe model has an infinite horizon with three groups of citizen-voters,\ni = 1, 2, 3.\nEach group has a continuum of citizens with unit mass.\nTime is discrete.\nPreferences of a member of i in period j are represented by the utility\nfunction\nδt-j\nct\ni + H(gt )\nt=j\nwhere ci is consumption of a unique consumption good and H(gt ) is\nt\nutility of public goods provided in period t.\nEach individual in the society has one unit of income per-period\n(exogenous) and thus faces a budget constraint\nci = 1 - τt + rt\ni .\nt\nwhere τt is a lump-some tax and ri is a group-specific transfer.\nt\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 11\nOctober 16, 2017.\n21 / 53\n\nEconomic Policy under Representative Democracy\nThe Effects of Political Institutions\nModel: Politicians\nThere are three politicians, one representing each of the groups.\nPoliticians enjoy politician-specific transfers denote by sl (how much\nt\nrent each gets to steal).\nA policy vector is thus denoted\ni\nl\npt = [τt , gt , {rt }, {st }]\nIn each period the political system has to determine pt - the tax on\nincomes, public good provision, transfers, and politician rents.

In this game the\nagenda setter aims to form a minimum winning coalition and thus\nwants to design a policy such that one other group supports it.\nThe agenda setter makes a take-it-or leave it offer to the other\nlegislator who is easiest to buy, where the price will be in terms of\nwhat the agenda setter has to offer the politician to get them to say\nyes.\nIn turn this will be determined by what that legislator has to deliver\nto his voters to get re-elected.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 11\nOctober 16, 2017.\n29 / 53\n\nEconomic Policy under Representative Democracy\nThe Effects of Political Institutions\nSimple Legislature: Argument (continued)\nFirst observe that the legislative bargaining game must have the\noutcome rm = rn = 0 for m, n 6= a.\nTo buy a legislator's vote, a must make transfers to his district. If bm ,\nsay, is set very high, then group m will be costly to buy for a and will\nbe excluded from the winning coalition.\nExclusion means no transfers for the district.\nThis situation creates a Bertrand game between districts m, n 6= a\nand imply that they underbid each other until\nbm = bn = 1 - τ + H(g ) and rm = rn = 0.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 11\nOctober 16, 2017.\n30 / 53\n\nEconomic Policy under Representative Democracy\nThe Effects of Political Institutions\nSimple Legislature: Argument (continued)\nNow define W to be the expected continuation value to any legislator\nfrom being elected.\nIf a legislator is re-elected he has an equal change of becoming\nagenda setter, or of taking on each of the other two possible roles,\neach legislator has the same continuation value.\nIn equilibrium sL ≥ 3 - 2δW . First note that in forming the\nminimum winning coalition a gives rents only to the legislator he\nincludes in the coalition, say legislator m.\nMoreover, he gives just enough to make m indifferent between\naccepting and saying no.\nGiven that the excluded legislator says no, if m deviates they all get\nthe status-quo payoff and are thrown out of offi ce.

If pk -j 6= 0 for some j ≤ k, all voters with bliss\n\npoint p αi < ε for some small ε vote for party B in all future\nelections.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 12\nOctober 18, 2017.\n7 / 22\n\nPolitical Compromise\nPolitical Compromise in Democracy\nRepeated Game Equilibria: Argument\nFirst note that once it comes to power, party B will always choose its\nmost preferred policy, p = -pB , since it's behaving under no\nconstraints.\nMoreover, since pA > pB > 0, more than half of the voters will\nsupport party B against party A when both of them are playing their\nmost preferred policy.\nThen, if party A adopts the policy of p = 0 in all periods, its utility is\n\nA\nA\n- p\ninf\n∑\nUC\nA = -\nβt p\n= 1 - β\nt=0\nIf it deviates to its most preferred policy, its utility this period is 0,\nbut from the next period onwards, the equilibrium policy will be\np = -pB , so the utility to deviating is\n\nB + pA\n-β p\nB\nA\ninf\n∑\nUD\nA = -\nβt p\n+ p\n=\n1 - β\nt =1\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 12\nOctober 18, 2017.\n8 / 22\n\nPolitical Compromise\nPolitical Compromise in Democracy\nRepeated Game Equilibria: Argument (continued)\nTherefore, despite party ideologies, the Condorcet winner will be\nimplemented as long as\nUA ≥ UD\nA ,\nC\nthat is, as long as\n\nB\nA\nA\nβ p\n+ p\n≥ p\nThis condition will be satisfied if β is high enough, that is, if\nA\np\nβ ≥\n(pB + pA )2 .\nThus better outcomes are possible even without commitment if\npolitical parties are patient, or if pB is suffi ciently large.\nThis last condition is interesting, since it emphasizes that greater\ndisagreement among the parties may be useful in forcing one of the\nparties to adopt the policies desired by the voters.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 12\nOctober 18, 2017.\n9 / 22\n\nPolitical Compromise\nPolitical Compromise in Democracy\nRepeated Game Equilibria: Further Issues\nQuestion: why did we choose party A as the one to be in power and\nimplement the Condorcet winner policy of voters?\nQuestion: how would you support an equilibrium in which party B is\ninduced to choose the Condorcet winner policy?\nQuestion: what happens if we allow nonstationary strategies? Can we\ndo better?\nWhat will the Pareto frontier look like? (See, for example, Dixit,\nGrossman and Gul, 2000).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 12\nOctober 18, 2017.\n10 / 22\n\nPolitical Compromise\nPolitical Compromise in Nondemocracies\nPolitical Compromise in Nondemocracies\nThe Olson stationary bandit argument: Mancur Olson formulated\nthe now famous stationary bandit argument (Maguire and Olson,\n1996).\nIt goes like this:\nWhat is bad for a society is to have a number of bandits that come and\ngo and rob citizens. They will apply maximal extraction, and thus kill\nany incentive for investment or effort.\nIf instead there is a single bandit that stays around (a \"stationary\nbandit\"), that's not so bad, because the bandit can use repeated game\nstrategies.\nTaking away everything would discourage investment. Thus the bandit\nhas an incentive to establish a reputation for taking only part of what\nis produced, thus encouraging people to continue producing.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 12\nOctober 18, 2017.\n11 / 22\n\nPolitical Compromise\nPolitical Compromise in Nondemocracies\nIs the Stationary Bandit Argument Compelling?\nSanchez de la Sierra (2014) provides evidence for this perspective by\nexploiting the differential increases in incentives of armed groups in\nthe civil war of Eastern Congo to become \"stationary bandits\"\nbecause of the coltan price hike.\nColtan is easier to tax because it's much harder to conceal than gold,\nso he uses gold as a control.\nHe therefore hypothesizes that \"attempted conquests\" should\nincrease due to the higher interaction of Coltan deposits and coltan\nprice, but not the same for gold.\nPotentially consistent with the stationary bandit argument - the\nrebels may want to become stationary bandits when the returns are\nhigher.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 12\nOctober 18, 2017.\n12 / 22\n\nPolitical Compromise\nPolitical Compromise in Nondemocracies\nEvidence\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 12\nOctober 18, 2017.\n13 / 22\nCourtesy of Raul Sanchez de la Sierra. Used with permission.\n\nPolitical Compromise\nPolitical Compromise in Nondemocracies\nBut\nYet this is a rather indirect argument.\nThe fact that these rebel groups are trying to control coltan-rich\nplaces when the price of coltan increases doesn't mean that they will\nact like stationary bandits (or will be building \"proto-states\").\nThey may just be attracted by greater naked extraction.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 12\nOctober 18, 2017.\n14 / 22\n\nPolitical Compromise\nPolitical Compromise in Nondemocracies\nBut (continued)\nEmpirically, long-lived dictators (Mobutu, Mugabe, the Duvaliers in\nHaiti) are not more developmental, and if anything seem to be among\nthe most kleptocratic.\nConceptually, this equates the state with organized banditry. But is\nthat right?\nTheoretically, Olson's vision is too narrow also.\nAcemoglu and Robinson (APSR 2006): the relationship between\nentrenchment and likelihood to take actions against economic\ndevelopment is inverse U-shaped. This is because a very\nnon-entrenched dictator has no reason to sabotage development in\norder to save his future rents.\nAcemoglu, Golosov and Tsyvinski (JET 2010): from a repeated games\nperspective, a less entrenched dictator may be easier to discipline. This\nis because if he deviates, society can more easily punish him by\nremoving him from power.

Similar to common value auctions.\nIn this lecture, we will develop these ideas formally and then provide\nsome evidence as to whether these kinds of considerations will matter\nin actual voting decisions.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n2 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nIntroduction\nThe Condorcet Jury Theorem\nThe first person to think about such issues was again Condorcet.\nCondorcet reasoned about the jury problem, where all jurors have the\nsame interests, and would like to convict a defendant if he is guilty.\nBut each has incomplete information (say a signal about the\nunderlying state of nature).\nCondorcet reasoned that if they all pool their information - say by\nvoting sincerely - then with a suffi ciently large jury, the law of large\nnumbers will kick in and the dispersed information of the jurors will\nbe well aggregated.\nSo voting acts as a good way of information aggregation.\nThis point was picked up about a century later by Francis Galton,\nwho developed the idea of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" and provided\nfascinating evidence consistent with it.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n3 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nConvicting the Innocent\nA Modern Jury Problem\nBut let's dig a little bit deeper into this (following Fedderson and\nPesendorfer, 1998).\nThere are n jury members who have to decide whether to convict a\ndefendant.\nThere are no conflicts of interest - all jury members would like to\nconvict the defendant if he is guilty, denoted by the underlying state\nθ = G , but not if he is innocent, θ = I .\nEach jury starts with a common prior that the defendant is guilty with\nprobability π ∈ (0, 1).\nThen receives a signal s = {g, i} (for example, from their reading of\nthe evidence presented at the trial). Suppose that the signals are\nconditionally independent and identically distributed and satisfy\nPr (s = g |θ = G ) = p and Pr (s = i|θ = I ) = q; q, p > 0.5 .\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n4 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nConvicting the Innocent\nUnanimity\nThe key assumption is that the jury requires unanimity to reach the\nverdict of x = G .\nLet the vote of juror j be denoted by vj ∈{g, i}. Then x = G if\nvj = g for all j.\nSuppose also that each member j of the group has the following\npayoff:\n⎧\n⎨ 0 if x = θ\nuj (x, θ) =\n-z if x = G and θ = I\n⎩ - (1 - z) if x = I and θ = G\nwhere z ∈ [0; 1].\nThis in particular implies that convicting an innocent defendant has a\nhigher negative payoff when z is greater (leading to more conservative\ndecisions).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n5 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nConvicting the Innocent\nBest Responses\nWhen will a juror vote to convict?\nSuppose first that the juror expects not to be pivotal - meaning that\nher vote doesn't matter. This will in particular happen when other\njurors have already voted to acquit (since the jury requires\nunanimity). In such cases her vote doesn't matter, so voting v = G\nhas no payoff implications.\nInstead, her vote matters (if and only) if she is pivotal, meaning that\nall n - 1 other jurors have voted to convict.\nIn this case, she would like to induce a collective decision (a jury\nverdict) such that\nx = I if Pr(θ = G |information set) ≤ z.\nThis simply says that given the costs of convicting an innocent, she\nwould only like to convict the defendant if the probability that he is\nguilty is greater than z.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n6 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nConvicting the Innocent\nOptimal Conviction\nTo simplify the discussion, let's assume that\nPr(θ = G |sj = g for all j) =\n\n> z\nn\n1-q\n1-π\n1 +\np\nπ\nso that when all information is against the defendant and if jurors had\naccess to this information, they would be confident enough to convict\nhim.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n7 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nConvicting the Innocent\nSincere Voting\nLet us now focus on the case where all jurors both \"sincerely\" and\nconsider the problem of juror 1 who has received signal s1 = i.\nThe key objects we need to compute is\nP1 = Pr(θ = G |sj = g for all j 6= 1 and s1 = i). Why?\nUnder sincere voting, this probability is\nP1 =\n\n.\nn-1\nq\n1-q\n1-π\n1 + 1-p\np\nπ\nDoes sincere voting make sense?\nFirst suppose that P1 < z, then together with our above assumption,\nthis condition ensures that sincere voting is an equilibrium (and in\nsome sense the jury system works well). Why?\nNow suppose that P1 > z. What happens?\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n8 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nConvicting the Innocent\nBayesian Nash Equilibrium\nLet us now understand how the Bayesian-Nash equilibrium works\nwhen P1 > z. (We note that this will always be the case when n is\nlarge. Is 12 large?).\nThen sincere voting is not an equilibrium.\nBut clearly, voting to convict always cannot be in equilibrium either.\nThe Bayesian-Nash equilibrium will then be in mixed strategies. In\nparticular, suppose that vj = g if sj = g, but also\nvj = g with probability γ if sj = i.\nFor such an equilibrium, we need each juror to be indifferent between\nvoting guilty and innocent when they receive sj = i. In other words,\nP1 = Pr(θ = G |vj = g for all j 6= 1 and s1 = i) = z.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n9 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nConvicting the Innocent\nBayesian Nash Equilibrium in the Limit\nIt can be shown (as it is intuitive) that as n increases, the probability\nof convicting the defendant converges increases, and as n → inf, it\nconverges to a positive number.\nThus large juries will over-convict - they also convict the guilty with\nprobability 1.\nWhy?\nEssentially, each juror finds it optimal to rely on the implicit\ninformation that if her vote is pivotal, it must be that others have\nvoted to convict, and that's pretty good evidence that the defendant\nis guilty.\nPut differently, no one wants to be a contrarian and acquit when\nothers are voting to convict.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n10 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nConvicting the Innocent\nLessons\nVoting in common-interest in complete information situations will be\nvery different than what we have seen so far.\nIf voters are \"hyper-rational\" to be able to make such inferences, they\nwill have a tendency to distort their information (thus not engage in\n\"sincere voting\").\nBut this may also involve major ineffi ciencies, very different from\nCondorcet's Jury Theorem.\nDoes this mean voting is always a very bad way of aggregating\ninformation? Well, yes and no.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n11 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nA Model of a Large Election\nFeddersen and Pesendorfer (1996) consider the following environment.\nThere our two states of nature, θ = {0, 1}, and two policy choices of\ncandidates, x ∈{0, 1}.\nThere are three types of voters, denoted by elements of the type\nspace T = {0, 1, i}.\nThe first two are committed voters and will always choose x = 0 or\nx = 1 either because of distributional or ideological reasons.\nThe last one designates \"independent\" voters, which we normally\nthink as the \"swing voters\". These independents have preferences\ngiven by\nUi (x, θ) = -I (x 6= θ) ,\nwhere I (x 6= θ) is the indicator function for the position of the\ncandidate from being different than the state of nature.\nThis implies that the voters received negative utility if the \"wrong\"\ncandidate is elected.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n12 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nA Common Value Model (continued)\nA candidate (policy) that obtains an absolute majority is chosen. If\nboth options obtain the same number of votes, then one of them is\nchosen at random.\nLet us suppose, without loss of any generality, that the prior\nprobability that the true state is θ = 0 is α ≤ 1/2, so that state\nθ = 1 is more likely ex ante.\nTo make the model work, there needs to be some uncertainty about\nthe preferences of other voters. One way to introduce this is to\nsuppose that how many other voters there are (meaning how many\nother voters could potentially turn out to vote) and what fractions of\nthose will be committed types are stochastically generated. (This is\nthe assumption first developed in Myerson and Weber, 1993).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n13 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nUncertainty\nSuppose, in particular, that the total number of voters is determined\nby Nature taking N + 1 independent draws from a potentially large\npool of voters.\nAt each draw, an actual voter is selected with probability 1 - pφ. This\nimplies that the number of voters is a stochastic variable with the\n\nbinomial distribution with parameters N + 1, 1 - pφ .\nConditional on being selected, an agent is independent with\n\nprobability pi /\n, is committed to x = 0 with probability\n\n1 - pφ\np0/ 1 - pφ, and is committed to x = 1 with probability\np1/ 1 - pφ .\nTherefore, the numbers of voters of different types also follow\nbinomial distributions.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n14 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nUncertainty (continued)\n\nThe probability vector pφ, pi , p0, p1 , like preferences and the prior\nprobability α, is common knowledge.\nFinally, each agent knows her type and also receives a signal\ns ∈ S = {0, 1, φ}, where the first two entries designate the actual\nstate, i.e., θ = 0 or θ = 1, so that conditional on receiving the signal\nvalues the agent will know the underlying state for sure.\nThe last entry means that the agent receives no relevant information\nand this event has probability q.\nThis formulation implies that some voters will potentially be fully\ninformed, but because all events are stochastic, whether there is\nindeed such an agent in the population or how many of them there\nare relative to committed types is not known by any of the voters.\nVoting truthfully is not necessarily optimal for independents. In fact\nthey may prefer to abstain rather than vote according to their\ninformation (priors or some other source of signals that are not\ncertain).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n15 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nStrategies\nA pure strategy here is simply\nσ : T × S → [φ, 0, 1] ,\nwhere φ denotes abstention.\nClearly, σ (0, ·) = 0 and σ (1, ·) = 1 (for committed voters).\nMoreover, it is also clear that σ (i, z) = z for z ∈{0, 1}, meaning\nthat independent informed voters will vote according to their (certain)\nposterior.\nThis implies that we can simply focus on the decisions by uninformed\nindependent voters, denoted by\n\nτ = τ0, τ1, τφ ,\nwhich correspond to the probabilities that they will vote for x = 0,\nx = 1 and abstain, respectively. Recall that though \"uninformed,\"\nthese voters have posteriors that are not equal to 1/2, thus have\nrelevant information.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n16 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nSwing Voter's Curse\nThe key observation in the analysis of this model is that, as in the\njury problem, an individual should only care about his or her vote\nconditional on being pivotal.\nSince they do not obtain direct utility from their votes and only care\nabout the outcome, their votes when there is a clear majority for one\nor the other outcome are irrelevant.\nBut this implies that one has to condition on a situation in which\none is pivotal in a large election.\nThis happens (in the unlikely event) where either an equal number of\nagents have voted for each choice, or one of the two choices is\nwinning with only one vote.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n17 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nSwing Voter's Curse (continued)\nThis intuition is suffi cient to establish the following proposition, which\ncaptures the idea of the \"swing voter's curse\".\nLet U (x, τ) be the expected utility of an uninformed independent\nagent to choose x ∈{0, 1, φ}, when all other independents are using\n(symmetric) mixed strategies given by τ.\nProposition\nSuppose that pφ > 0, q > 0 and that N is greater than 2 and even. Then\nif U (1, τ) = U (0, τ), then all uninformed independent voters abstain.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n18 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nIntuition\nIf U (1, τ) = U (0, τ), meaning that an uninformed voter is indifferent\nbetween voting for either candidate (policy), then he or she must\nprefer to abstain.\nBy continuity, we could also show that if |U (1, τ) - U (0, τ)| < ε for\nε suffi ciently small, then the same conclusion will apply. This is\ndespite the fact that uninformed voters actually have relevant\ninformation, because the prior α can be arbitrarily small.\nIntuitively, when a voter expects the same utility from the two options\navailable to him or her, then abstaining and leaving the decision to\nanother voter who is more likely to be informed is better.\nThis is despite the fact that the voter may be leaving the decision to\na committed type.\nDifferent from the implications of models in which swing voters are\n\"powerful\".\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n19 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nImplications\nThe implication is that useful information will be lost in the elections,\nand this is the essence of the \"swing voter's curse\".\nNevertheless, Feddersen and Pesendorfer also show that in large\nelections information still aggregates in the sense that the correct\nchoice is made with arbitrarily high probability. In particular:\nProposition\nSuppose that pφ > 0, q > 0 and pi 6= |p1 - p0|, then for every ε > 0,\n\nthere exists N such that for N > N, the probability that the correct\ncandidate gets elected is greater than 1 - ε.\nThe idea of this result is that as the size of the electorate becomes\nlarge, uninformed independents mix between the \"disadvantaged\"\ncandidate and abstaining, in such a way that informed independents\nbecome pivotal with very high probability.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n20 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nDiscussion\nResults depend on \"hyper rational voters\". Is this realistic?\nOn the other hand, the resulting voting rule may be \"simple\": abstain\nif you do not have strong information. But this conclusion is still\nfollows from a complicated reasoning and sometimes mixed strategies\nare necessary.\nHow to interpret the result that the correct action will be taken in\nlarge elections?\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n21 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nAny Voter's Curse\nBut if voters are strategic in this fashion and vote just to be pivotal,\nturnout will be extremely low with even trivial costs of voting.\nTurnout has to be low in particular in order to make each voter be\npivotal with a suffi ciently high probability.\nNo way of explaining turnout rates of 20 or 30% in large elections (let\nalone 60 or 70%).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n22 / 23\n\nVoting with Incomplete Information\nSwing Voter's Curse\nEvidence?\nWe will discuss evidence in the next lecture.\nBut it's worth mentioning the work by Battaglini, Morton and Palfrey\n(2008, 2010), which looks at voting behavior in reasonable-sized lab\nexperiments with common values (as with the model here).\nThey find support for two of the key features here:\nSwing voter's curse: abstention by low information independent voters.\nSwing voter's cunning strategy: they mix in a way to encourage more\ninformed independence to be pivotal (and this cunning strategy is\nstronger when there is greater imbalance between committed voters as\ntheory would suggest).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lecture 3\nSeptember 13, 2017.\n23 / 23\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.770 Introduction to Political Economy\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

In other words, they will solve:\nmax φτm (1 - τm )(1-α)/αAm λθm / (1 - α)\nsubject to (18).\nThe first-order condition for an interior solution can be expressed as\n1 - α\ndAm\nτm\nAm -\nAm + τm\n= 0\nα\n1 - τm\ndτm\nwhere\ndAm\n(1 - τm )(1-α)/α\n= -\n< 0\ndτm\nΓ00 (Am )\n1 - β 1 - α\ntakes into account the effect of future taxes on technology choice at\ntime t = 0.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n28 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nTechnology Adoption and Holdup\nTechnology Adoption: Revenue Extraction (continued)\nProposition: Consider the game with technology adoption, and suppose\nthat Condition (ES) holds and φ > 0, then the unique political equilibrium\nfeatures τm = τRE ≡ min {α, τ } for all t. If the elite could commit to a\nt\ntax policy at time t = 0, they would prefer to commit to τTA < τRE .\nTherefore, in contrast to the pure holdup problem where SPE could\nprevent the additional ineffi ciency (when β ≥ 1 - α), with the\ntechnology adoption game, the ineffi ciency survives the SPE.\nThe reason is that, since middle class producers invest only once at\nthe beginning, there is no possibility of using history-dependent\npunishment strategies.\nThis illustrates the limits of implicit agreements to keep tax rates low.\nSuch agreements not only require a high discount factor (β ≥ 1 - α),\nbut also frequent investments by the middle class, so that there is a\ncredible threat against the elite if they deviate from the promised\npolicies.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n29 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nTechnology Adoption and Holdup\nConclusion\nDistributional conflicts will lead to distortionary policies.\nThe extent of distortions depends on whether groups in power wish to\nmanipulate factor prices.\nFactor price manipulation could lead to higher taxes, insecure\nproperty rights, and barriers against technology adoption\nThese equilibria not necessarily Pareto suboptimal- the set of\ninstruments is restricted.\nHowever, Pareto ineffi ciencies arise when there are nontrivial dynamic\ninteractions (as in holdup or technology adoption)\nAlso note that simply changing the identity of the group in power\nmay not improve the allocation of resources as we discuss in greater\ndetail next.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n30 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nSimple Model of Elite Control\nInfinite horizon economy populated by a continuum 1 of risk neutral\nagents, with discount factor equal to β < 1.\nUnique non-storable final good denoted by y.\nThe expected utility of agent j at time 0 is given by:\nUj\n0 = E0\ninf\n∑βtct\nj ,\n(19)\nt=0\nj\nwhere c ∈ R denotes the consumption of agent j at time t and Et is\nt\nthe expectations operator conditional on information available at time\nt.\nSuppose that each individual dies with a small probability ε in every\nperiod, and a mass ε of new individuals are born (with the convention\nthat after death there is zero utility and β is the discount factor\ninclusive of the probability of death).\nWe will consider the limit of this economy with ε → 0.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n31 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nOccupations\nproduction workers versus capitalists/entrepreneurs.\nAll agents have the same productivity as workers, their productivity in\nentrepreneurship differs.\nj\nAgent j at time t has entrepreneurial talent/skills a ∈{AL , AH } with\nt\nAL < AH .\nTo become an entrepreneur, an agent needs to set up a firm, if he\ndoes not have an active firm already.\nSetting up a new firm may be costly because of entry barriers created\nby existing entrepreneurs.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n32 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nStates\nEach agent therefore starts period t with two state variables:\nj\nskill level at ∈{AH , AL}\njst ∈{0, 1} denoting whether the individual has an active firm.\nj\nWe refer to an agent with s = 1 as a member of the \"elite,\" since he\nt\nwill have an advantage in becoming an entrepreneur (when there are\nentry barriers), and in an oligarchic society, he may be politically more\ninfluential than non-elite agents.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n33 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nDecisions\nWithin each period, each agent makes the following decisions:\nj\nj\nan occupation choice et ∈{0, 1}, and in addition if e = 1, i.e., if he\nt\nbecomes an entrepreneur,\ninvestment, employment, and hiding decisions, kt\nj , lj and ht\nj , where hj\nt\nt\ndenotes whether he decides to hide his output in order to avoid\ntaxation (since the final good is not storable, the consumption decision\nis simply given by the budget constraint).\nAgents also make the policy choices in this society.\nThree policy choices:\na tax rate τt ∈ [0, 1] on output,\nlump-sum transfers to all agents denoted by Tt ∈ [0, inf),\ncost Bt ∈ [0, inf) to set up a new firm.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n34 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nProduction\nj\nAn entrepreneur with skill level a can produce\nt\nyj =\n1 (aj\nt )α(kt\nj )1-α(lt\nj )α\n(20)\nt\n1 -

Leapfrogging is more likely when δ, AL /AH and M are low.\nOligarchies are more likely to be relatively ineffi cient in the long run:\nwhen δ is low, meaning that democracy is unable to pursue highly\npopulist policies\nwhen AH is high relative to AL, so that high-skill comparative\nadvantage is important\nM is low, so that a random selection of agents contains a small fraction\nof high-skill agents, making oligarchic sclerosis highly distortionary.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n65 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nComparison between Democracy and Oligarchy (continued)\nOutput in democracy\nOutput in oligarchy\nOutput in oligarchy\nt\nt'\nYD\nY'E\ninf\nYE\nYE\ninf\nYt\nFigure 3: Comparison of aggregate output in democracy and oligarchy.\nThe dashed curve depicts output in oligarchy when (44) holds, and the\nsolid line when it does not.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n66 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nOther Systems?\nCan other political systems do better?\nYes, for example, delegate taxes to entrepreneurs and entry barriers to\nworkers\nBut, generally not feasible.\nPolitical power \"indivisible\": if the system is democratic, the party in\npower can also decides taxes.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n67 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nNew Technologies and Institutional Flexibility\nDemocracies also more flexible.\nSuppose that at some date t0 > 0, there is an unanticipated and\nexogenous arrival of a new technology, enabling entrepreneur j to\nproduce:\nj\nj\nt )α(kt\nj )1-α(lt\nj )α\ny =\n(ψaˆ\n,\nt\n1 - α\nj\nwhere ψ > 1 and aˆ is the talent of this entrepreneur with the new\nt\ntechnology.\nSuppose lj = λ for the new technology as well, entrepreneur j's\nt\noutput can be written as\n\nmax\n1 (ψaˆt\nj )α(kt\nj )1-αλα ,\n1 (at\nj )α(kt\nj )1-αλα\n.\n1 - α\n1 - α\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n68 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nNew Technologies and Institutional Flexibility (continued)\nj\nAlso to simplify the discussion, assume that the law of motion of aˆ is\nt\nj\nsimilar to that of at , given by\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\nAH\nwith probability\nσH\nif aˆj = AH\nt\nAH\nwith probability\nσL\nif aˆj = AL\nt\nj\n=\naˆ\n(45)\nt +1\nj\nAL\nwith probability 1 - σH\nif aˆ = AH\nt\nj\nAL\nwith probability 1 - σL\nif aˆ = AL\nt\nComparative advantage shifts to a new set of entrepreneurs.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n69 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nOligarchy versus Democracy\nNew Technologies and Institutional Flexibility (continued)\nDemocracy will immediately switched to the new technology, thus\nψ\n1-α\nYˆ D ≡\n(1 - δ) α AH .\n1 - α\nIn contrast, switch to new technology will be delayed in oligarchy in\noligarchy.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n70 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nEvidence\nEvidence for Oligarchic Stagnation\nIn a very interesting paper Stasavage (2014) argues that autonomous\ncities provides an illustration of oligarchic growth followed by\nstagnation.\nThe cities were dominated by merchant guilds, who subsequently\nblocked the introduction of new technologies and rise of new\nindustries.\nBut early on, they also provided secure property rights for merchants.\nThis fits the general set of ideas discussed in this lecture.\nThe evidence is suggestive - rapid city population growth for\nautonomous cities, and then stagnation.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n71 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nEvidence\nEarly and Late Effects of Oligarchic Cities\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 13 and 14\nOctober 23 and 25, 2017.\n72 / 74\n\nEconomic Policy under Nondemocratic Institutions\nEvidence\nQuadratic Estimates\nGrowth of population as a function of number of years of autonomy\nand its square.\n(c) American Political Science Association.

Why do they turn out?\nTo what extent do the Dowsian prediction of convergence to the\nmiddle/the median voter's preferences work out in practice?\n3 Do political decisions reflect the preferences of the median\nvoter/voters?\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n2 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nWhy and How Do Voters Vote?\nWhy Do Voters Vote?\nAs we have seen, it is diffi cult to get people to turn out if they are\nvoting to be pivotal (unless voting is costless or pleasurable).\nSo this means there are three sets of reasons why people might be\nturning out:\nThey enjoy voting.\nThey are subject to social pressure.\nThey vote because of some moral/ethical considerations.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n3 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nWhy and How Do Voters Vote?\nDo Voters Enjoy Voting?\nThis is not an easy question to answer.\nSo instead we can look at whether once you induce people to start\nvoting (exogenously), they continue to vote.\nThis is the so-called \"habit-formation\" hypothesis, for which you can\ngo back as far as Aristotle (on ethical behavior feeding into further\nethical behavior).\nMore recently advocated by Brody and Sniderman (1977). We know\nthat there are significant persistent differences in likelihood of voting\nacross groups and individuals. But a huge identification problem.\nGerber, Green and Shachar (2003) provide evidence using the\nvote-canvassing RCT in Connecticut.\nThey encourage voting with door-to-door canvassing and phone calls\nbefore the 1998 general election, and then look at the effects on\nvoting behavior in 1998, and then in a subsequent election in 1999.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n4 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nWhy and How Do Voters Vote?\nHabit-Formation\nThe results are consistent with this hypothesis, though not\noverwhelming.\n(c) John Wiley & Son, Inc.

(2017).\nThey design a field experiment with door-to-door canvassing in\nChicago following the 2010 congressional elections.\nThe creative new element is that the arrival of canvassers is\npreannounced to one of the treatment groups, and incentives to lie\nabout past voting are manipulated.\nDesign: no flyer group receives no flyers, treatment groups receive\nflyers that do or do not mentioned election, and the opt out groups\nreceive a flyer with a box to check if they do not want to be disturbed.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n6 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nWhy and How Do Voters Vote?\nSocial Pressure (continued)\n(c) Oxford University Press.

Used with permission.\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nDo Voters Vote Strategically?\nDuverger's Law and Strategic Voting\nOne implication of strategic voting is Duverger's Law, which claims\nthat with simple majority, single-ballot elections, there will be a\nstrong tendency towards a two-party system, because strategic voting\nconsiderations will make voters shun non-contender parties. In\ncontrast, proportional representation or dual-ballot system can\nsupport multiple parties.\nFujiwara (2011) tests this implication using a regression-discontinuity\ndesign based on different voting systems in place in Brazilian\nmunicipalities based on population.\nIn municipal elections (for mayors), a single ballot or the dual ballot\nsystem is used below and above the cutoff of 200,000.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n16 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nDo Voters Vote Strategically?\nEvidence for Duverger's Law\nRD estimate:\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n17 / 52\nCourtesy of Thomas Fujiwara.

Used with permission.\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nDo Voters Vote Strategically?\nSummary\nOverall, quite a bit of evidence that there is some strategic voting,\nand perhaps quite a bit of it.\nBut this evidence doesn't really speak to whether people are very\nsophisticated or just so-so strategic.\nStrategic voting may not be inconsistent with rule-utilitarianism\neither.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n20 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nDowsian Convergence\nTesting Dowsian Convergence\nThe Dowsian convergence result, discussed in the first two lectures, is\nviewed as iconic of basic voting theory.\nIt has attracted considerable attention from social scientists and\nbeyond.\nAs these things go, it is also a relatively easy theory to test.\nOne approach is to use regression discontinuity design: holding the\nideology of the electorate constant, which party gets elected shouldn't\nmatter if we are indeed in the Dowsian world.\nSeveral papers have attacked this problem.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n21 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nDowsian Convergence\nImportance of Party Identity in the US\nLee et al. (2004) do this using US Congress elections.\nThey focus on basic regression discontinuity estimates and look at\nnominate scores as a summary of the voting record (from rollcall\nvotes) of U.S. House members.\nThey also look at likelihood of voting the same way as the\nDemocratic Party leader.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n22 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nDowsian Convergence\nNo Dowsian Convergence in the US\n(c) Oxford University Press.

The\nunique equilibrium is Dowsian policy convergence.\nWhy?\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n34 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nDowsian Convergence\nAdd Frictions\nThe previous result is no longer true if there are \"frictions\".\nThe most obvious friction is idiosyncratic party preferences as in the\nprobabilistic voting model. In this case, each politician has a captured\naudience, and will be able to push his policies (at least a little bit) in\nthe direction of his bliss point. (What is a simple proof of this?)\nAnother friction might be preventing certain types of parties from\nentering. For example, parties representing the interests of certain\nethnic groups or worker groups are banned from elections in many\ncountries (e.g., Turkey, Burma).\nIf we have that both parties are to the right of the median voter, then\nthe above theorem doesn't work.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n35 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nAre Policies Responsive to Voters?\nPolicy Responsiveness\nThe lack of Dowsian policy convergence does not imply that policies\nare not, on average, responsive to voter preferences.\nAt some level whether this is the case or not is much more important.\nInvestigating this issue is made complicated by the fact that we don't\ngenerally know what voters want. But there is one setting in which\nwe infer changes in voter preferences - de jure or de facto changes in\nthe voting franchise.\nIn contrast to comparative statics with respect to inequality, which we\nsaw not to be robust in the second lecture, comparative statics with\nrespect to changes in the voting franchise are fairly straightforward.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n36 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nAre Policies Responsive to Voters?\nDemocracy and Redistribution\nConsider a model similar to that discussed in the second lecture,\nwhere each individual has income yi and the only fiscal tools are a\nlinear income tax and lump-sum redistribution.\nAs a result, the most preferred tax rate of a richer individual is lower\nthan that of a poorer individual (holding everything else including the\ndistribution of income constant).\nSuppose that individuals are ranked according to income, and only\nthose above the qth percentile are enfranchised. An extension of the\nfranchise - a democratization - is a decline in this percentile.\nTheorem\nConsider an extension of the franchise. This always increases taxes and\nredistribution.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n37 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nAre Policies Responsive to Voters?\nMeasuring Democracy\nTo test this prediction, we need to measure of democracy or\ndemocratizations. This is in general tricky.\nAcemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson (2014, 2017) developed a\nbinary index based on several sources.\nUsing this annual measure of democracy, they investigate the effects\nof democratizations on taxes, revenues and inequality.\nthere are several econometric issues one has to be careful about\n(serial correlation, endogeneity, Nickell bias, etc.)\nAll the same, for our focus here, the robust result is that\ndemocratizations leads to higher taxes and government revenues.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n38 / 52\n\nVoting and Political Decisions in Practice\nAre Policies Responsive to Voters?\nDemocracy and Taxes\nNB: GDP is controlled for on the RHS, so these are effects on taxes.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 4 and 5\nSeptember 18 and 20, 2017.\n39 / 52\nCourtesy of Daron Acemoglu, Suresh Naidu, Pascual Restrepo, and James A.

Robinson.

But if so, why are taxes\ngoing up?\nDemocracy is responsive to the middle class, and the middle class may\nwant lower redistribution towards the poor when the poor are added to\nthe franchise.\nDemocratizations may change the structure of the economy, creating\nmore inequality-generating opportunities (e.g., the fall of apartheid in\nSouth Africa).\nAcemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo and Robinson provide evidence consistent\nwith the second and third channels.

(This does also relate to political agency and other\naspects of representative democracy we will discuss into lectures).\nClientelism and coercion: how voters can be influenced to vote in ways\nthat are not directly in their interests.\nPopulism: how extreme or nonsustainable policies may result.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n2 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nLobbying\nWe start with a simple model of lobbying due to Grossman and\nHelpman (1994).\nThe advantage of this setup is that it links to our simplest model of\nelectoral politics - where parties choose policies ex ante - and also\nto our analysis of probabilistic voting.\nImagine that there are G groups of agents, with the same economic\npreferences.\nThe utility of an agent in group g, when the policy that is\nimplemented is given by the vector p ∈P ⊂ RK , is equal to\nUg (p) - γg (p)\nAppier Ug (p) is the usual indirect utility function, and γg (p) is the\nper-person lobbying contribution from group g.\nWe will allow these contributions to be a function of the policy\nimplemented by the politician, and to emphasize this, it is written\nwith p as an explicit argument.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n3 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nLobbying (continued)\nFollowing Grossman and Helpman, let us assume that there is a\npolitician in power, and he has a utility function of the form\nG\nG\nV (p) ≡∑αg γg (p) + a ∑αgUg (p)\n(1)\ng =1\ng =1\nαg is the share of group g in the population.\na determines how much the politician cares about aggregate welfare.\nWhen a = 0, he only cares about money, and when a → inf, he acts\nas a utilitarian social planner.\nOne reason why politicians might care about aggregate welfare is\nbecause of electoral politics (for example, they may receive rents or\nutility from being in power as in the last subsection and their vote\nshare might depend on the welfare of each group).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n4 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nLobbying (continued)\nNow consider the problem of an individual j in group g.\nBy contributing some money, he might be able to sway the politician\nto adopt a policy more favorable to his group, but standard free rider\nproblem.\nTherefore, only organized groups can contribute.\nSuppose that out of the G groups of agents, G 0 < G are organized as\nlobbies, and can collect money among their members in order to\nfurther the interests of the group.\nThe remaining G - G 0 are unorganized, and will make no\ncontributions. Without loss of any generality, let us rank the groups\nsuch that groups g = 1, ..., G 0 to be the organized ones.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n5 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nLobbying (continued)\nThe lobbying game takes the following form:\nevery organized lobby g simultaneously offers a schedule γg (p) ≥ 0\nwhich denotes the payments they would make to the politician when\npolicy p ∈P is adopted.\nafter observing the schedules, the politician chooses p.\nNotice the important assumption here that contributions to\npoliticians (campaign contributions or bribes) can be conditioned on\nthe actual policy that's implemented by the politicians.\nThis assumption may be a good approximation to reality in some\nsituations, but in others, lobbies might simply have to make up-front\ncontributions and hope that these help the parties that are expected\nto implement policies favorable to them get elected.\nThis is a potentially complex game, since lobbies are choosing\nfunctions (rather than real numbers or vectors).\nNevertheless, the equilibrium of this lobbying game takes a relatively\nsimple form.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n6 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nLobbying Equilibrium\nTheorem\nIn the lobbying game described above, contribution functions for groups\ng = 1, 2...J, {γˆ g (·)}\nand policy p∗ constitute a SPE if:\ng =1,2..J\n1. γˆ g (·) is feasible in the sense that 0 ≤ γˆ g (p) ≤ Ug (p).\n2.

That is, the contribution function of each lobby\nis such that there exists a policy that makes no contributions to the\npolitician, and gives her the same utility.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n8 / 76\n\n!\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nSketch Proof\nThese results follow using an analysis similar to the menu options of\nBernheim and Whinston (1986).\nConditions 1 and 2 are easy to understand.\nNo group would ever offer a contribution schedule that does not\nsatisfy Condition 1.\nCondition 2 has to hold, since the politician chooses the policy.\nIf Condition 3 did not hold, then the lobby could change its\ncontribution schedule slightly and improve its welfare, as we show\nnext.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n9 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nSketch Proof (continued)\n∗\nSuppose condition 3 does not hold for lobby g = 1, and instead of p ,\nsome pˆ maximizes (2).\nDenote the difference in the values of (2) evaluated at these two\nvectors by Δ > 0.\nConsider the following contribution schedule for lobby g = 1:\nG 0\nαg γˆ g (p ∗ ) + a\nG\n∑\nγ 1 (p)\n=\n1 ∑\nαgUg (p ∗ )\n[\nα1\ng =1\ng =1\nG 0\nG\n∑αg γˆ g (p) - a ∑αgUg (p) + εc1 (p)]\n-\ng =2\ng =1\nwhere c1 (p) is an arbitrary function that reaches its maximum at\np = pˆ.\nFollowing this contribution offer by lobby 1, the politician would\nchoose p = pˆ for any ε > 0.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n10 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nSketch Proof (continued)\nTo see that this choices optimal for the politician, note that by part\n(1), the politician would choose policy p that maximizes\nG 0\nG\n=1\n∑\ng\nα1 γ 1 (p) + ∑αg γˆ g (p) + a\nαgUg (p)\n=2\ng\nG 0\nG\n∑αg γˆ g (p ∗ ) + a ∑αgUg (p ∗ ) + εc1 (p) .\n=\ng =1\ng =1\nSince for any ε > 0 this expression is maximized by pˆ, the politician\nwould choose pˆ.\nThe change in the welfare of lobby 1 as a result of changing its\nstrategy is Δ - εc1 (pˆ).\nSince Δ > 0, for small enough ε, the lobby gains from this change,\nshowing that the original allocation could not have been an\nequilibrium.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n11 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nSketch Proof (continued)\nFinally, condition 4 ensures that the lobby is not making a payment to\nthe politician above the minimum that is required.\nSuppose this condition were not true for some lobby, say lobby 1.\nThen lobby 1 could reduce its contribution function by a constant -\nfrom γ1 (p) to γ1(p) - ε. Since the shift down by a constant does\nnot change marginal incentives for the politician, for ε suffi ciently\nsmall, the politician would still choose the same policy. But since\nε > 0, lobby 1 would increase its payoff.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n12 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nDifferentiable Contribution Functions\nNext suppose that these contribution functions are differentiable.\nThen, it has to be the case that for every policy choice, pk , within the\nvector p ∗, we must have from the first-order condition of the\npolitician that\nG 0\nG\n∗)\n∂γˆ g (p\n∂Ug (p ∗)\n∑\n∑\nαg\nαg\n= 0 for all k = 1, 2, .., K\n+ a\n∂pk\n∂pk\ng =1\ng =1\nFrom the first-order condition of each lobby that\n\nG\n∗)\n∂Ug (p ∗)\n∗)\n∂γˆ g (p\nγg\n∂ ˆ\n(p\n∑\nαg\nαg\n-\n+\n+\n∂pk\n∂pk\n∂pk\ng 0 =1\nG\n∗)\n∂Ug (p\n∑αg\n= 0\na\ng 0=1\n∂pk\nfor all k = 1, 2, .., K and g = 1, 2, .., G 0 .\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n13 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nDifferentiable Contribution Functions (continued)\nCombining these two first-order conditions, we obtain\n∂γˆ g (p ∗)\n∂Ug (p ∗)\n=\n(3)\n∂pk\n∂pk\nfor all k = 1, 2, .., K and g = 1, 2, .., G 0 .\nIntuitively, at the margin each lobby is willing to pay for a change in\npolicy exactly as much as this policy will bring them in terms of\nmarginal return.\nBut then this implies that the equilibrium can be characterized as\nG 0\nG\np ∗ ∈ arg max ∑αgUg (p) + a ∑αgUg (p) .\np\nj =1\nj =1\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n14 / 76\n\n!\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nLobbying\nDifferentiable Contribution Functions (continued)\nConsequently, there is an interesting parallel between the lobbying\nequilibrium and the pure strategy equilibria of probablilistic\nvoting models analyzed before.\nLike the latter, the lobbying equilibrium can also be represented as a\nsolution to the maximization of a weighted social welfare function,\nwith individuals in unorganized groups getting a weight of a and those\nin organized group receiving a weight of 1 + a. Intuitively, 1/a\nmeasures how much money matters in politics, and the more money\nmatters, the more weight groups that can lobby receive.\nAs a → inf, we converge to the utilitarian social welfare function.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n15 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nApplication of Lobbying to Distributional Conflict\nLobbying and Distributional Conflict\nConsider a simple setting with two groups, rich and poor.\nSuppose that the rich are organized and the poor are not.\nWithout lobbying, social welfare maximization would typically involve\nredistribution from the rich to the poor.\nBut with lobbying, the weight of the rich in the induced social welfare\nfunction increases, and we may end up with no redistribution.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n16 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nCampaign Contributions\nCampaign Contributions\nAn alternative conception of what organized groups do: campaign\ncontributions used for affecting equilibrium election outcomes.\nConsider a probabilistic voting model with campaign contributions.\nLet contributions to party P be where\nOg αgC g\nCP = ∑g\nP\nOg is an indicator variable for whether group g is organized or not,\nC g\nP is contribution per member, and αg denotes the size of group g.\nThe effect of contributions is introduced as affecting the balance of\ndifferent politicians. In particular, suppose as before that individuals\nin a group will vote for\nUi (pA ) - Ui (pB ) - δ ≥ σi ,\nwhere δ is an aggregate random valance variable affecting all voters.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n17 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nCampaign Contributions\nCampaign Contributions (continued)\nAssume that\n\nδ = δ + η × (CB - CA ),\nso campaign spending influences this valance parameter. The\nparameter η measures the effectiveness of campaign spending.\nWith usual arguments, the indifferent voter in group J is defined by\nthe threshold\nσg = Ug (pA ) - Ug (pB ) + η(CA - CB ) - δ .\nIn addition, assume that all groups are symmetric, and have σg\ndistributed uniformly over\n\n-\n,\n.\n2φ 2φ\nSuppose also that the parameter δ has a uniform distribution on\n\n-\n,\n.\n2ψ 2ψ\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n18 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nCampaign Contributions\nCampaign Contributions (continued)\nThis implies that the probability of party A winning the election is\nPr [A] =\n+ ψ [U(pA ) - U(pB ) + η(CA - CB )]\nwhere\nU(pP ) = ∑ αgUg (pP )\ng\nis a measure of average preferences.\nA utilitarian social planner would have simply maximized this.\nMoreover, given the symmetry of all the groups, we know from our\nabove analysis that probabilistic voting would have also maximized\nthis. (Symmetry of all groups is adopted to highlight that any\ndeviation from utilitarian social welfare function is due to the effects\nof lobbying).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n19 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nCampaign Contributions\nCampaign Contributions (continued)\nWe continue to assume that the only objective of the parties is to\ncome to power.\nThe question is how lobbying changes this. To understand this, let us\nlook at the objective function of lobbies.\nAssume that the lobby for group J has the objective function:\n\nPr [A] Ug (pA ) + (1 - Pr [A])Ug (pB ) -\n(CA\ng ) + (CB\ng )2 ,\nwhich means that they don't care about which party comes to power,\nonly about the implemented policy.

The\nclientelism that resulted was not redistributive and generally\nbenefited only a relatively small proportion of the citizenry\" (van\nde Walle, 2003).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 6 and 7\nSeptember 25 and 27, 2017.\n36 / 76\n\nElectoral Politics Gone Wrong\nClientelism\nIdeas on Clientelism\nClientelism may result from \"repeated game interactions\": if the\nparticular village doesn't vote for a particular politician, they won't\nget transfers in the future.\nBut in practice, clientelism seems to be related to political middlemen\nand networks (e.g., Finan and Schechter, 2012).\nIt might be very effective in buying turnout (rather than buying\nvotes) (e.g., Nichter, 2008).\nClientelism is most straightforward when it takes the form of \"vote\nbuying\" or even \"vote coercion\" (e.g., Baland and Robinson, 2008).\nBut even with secret ballots, \"reciprocity\"-type concerns me support\nclientelism (e.g., Finan and Schechter, 2012).\nWhy is clientelism different than usual electoral politics?

This guarantees payoff of\nR + y\nGiven that this much rent must be left to politician, an upper bound\non citizens'payoff is\n(R + y ) - (R + y )\n1 - δ\nδ\n=\n(R + y )\n1 - δ\nAnother upper bound is total output 1-δ y.\nSo overall upper bound on citizens'payoffs is\nmin {δ (R + y ) , y }\n1 - δ\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n6 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nStatic Model with Full Information\nBest Equilibrium\nThere is a simple equilibrium that always gives citizens their best\npossible payoff (a best SPE):\nPolitician is required to provide public goods at least\n∗\ng = min {δ (R + y ) , y }. (Reelected iff he/she does this).\nPolitician provides exactly this much.\nIn stationary equilibrium of this form, politician IC constraint is:\n∗ ) ≥ R + y\n(R + y - g\n1 - δ\nor equivalently\n∗\ng ≤ δ (R + y ) ,\nwhich is satisfied, and thus we have characterized a best SPE for the\ncitizens, with their utility given by\nmin {δ (R + y ) , y } .\n1 - δ\nThe IC constraint ensures that politicians receives enough rents.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n7 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nStatic Model with Full Information\nDiscussion\nComparative statics: in this best equilibrium, citizen utility ↑ in\nδ, R, y. Is this intuitive?\nIn this case, no gains from nonstationary strategies. Why?\nStill, there are other SPEs. How do we ensure that this one arises?\nAre there simple strategies that voters could use to implement this\nSPE?\nConsider retrospective voting strategies, where citizens kick out the\npolitician if they fall below a reservation utility.\nThen choose the reservation utility as min{δ(R + y ), y }.\nBut problem: suppose there is cost ε of replacing the politician.

So what happens to distortions in the long\nrun?\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n16 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nOptimal Nonstationary Equilibria\nMain Result\nTheorem\nIn the optimal equilibrium, output is distorted downward in period 0 (that\nis, τ0 > 0).\nThe continuation values promised to the politician (wt ) are non-decreasing\nand converge to some w ∗ .\nAlso, distortions disappear in the long run, i.e., τt → 0 as t → inf.\nBecause future payments to the politician relax the IC constraint, it's\nbetter to give late rewards than earlier rewards.\nThis leads to backloading.\nWhy not give everything very late? Because of concave utility.\nSo rewards buildup slowly over time, until the IC constraint becomes\nslack.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n17 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nOptimal Nonstationary Equilibria\nProof: Recursive Formulation\nThe easiest way of proving this result is via the recursive formulation\nof the problem.\nWhat's best payoff for citizens consistent with politican getting payoff\nw?\n\n+\nV (w ) = max u (g ) - h (y ) + δV\nw\ny ,g ,w +\nsubject to\n+\nw = v (y - g ) + δw\n(PK, γ)\n+\nv (y - g ) + δw\n≥ v (y )\n(IC, ψ)\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n18 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nOptimal Nonstationary Equilibria\nFirst-Order Conditions\nFOCw + :\n+\nV 0\nw\n= -γ - ψ = V 0 (w ) - ψ\nwhere γ is the multiplier the promise keeping constrained and ψ is the\nmultiplier on the politician IC constraint.\nFOCy ,g :\nu0 (g ) - h0 (y ) = ψv 0 (y )\nThis clarifies that ψ is related to distortions. If ψ = 0, then\nu0 (g ) - h0 (y ) = 0 or equivalently, τ = 0.

This would be\nU2\nN = (y -\n\nη(y -r )\nwhere η is their posterior about the incumbent's ability.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n24 / 43\nU2\nI =\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nCareer Concerns of Politicians\nCareer Concerns (continued)\nNow suppose that voters know that the politician will choose r 1\namounts of rents for himself.\nThen they can estimate\ng1\nη = y - r 1\nand their optimal reelection decision is\n1 iff η ≥ E (η) = 1\np I =\n.\n0 otherwise.\nThe problem is that r 1 is an equilibrium choice by the politician.\nHe will try to make this choice in a way that affects the beliefs of\ncitizens and his probability of remaining in power, for example, by\nproviding more public goods.\nThis is why this class of models are sometimes called \"signal\njamming\" models.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n25 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nCareer Concerns of Politicians\nCareer Concerns (continued)\nTo make more progress, let us first look at the probability that he\nkeeps power.\nThis is\npI\n= Prob [ pI\n= 1] = Prob [ η ≥ 1]\n\n=\n=\nProb\n1 + ξ\ng1\n≥ 1 = Prob\ny - r1\n\ny - r1\n1 - y - r1\nη(y - r1)\ny - r1\n≥ 1\nwhere the last equality exploits the uniform assumption for η.\nNow the incumbent will choose r1 to maximize\nυI = r1 + pI β(R + r2), which we can write as:\n\ny - r1\nmax υI = r1 +\n+ ξ 1 -\nβ(R + r )\nr1\ny - r 1\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n26 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nCareer Concerns of Politicians\nCareer Concerns (continued)\nThe first-order condition of this maximization problems gives\nξ(y - r 1)\n1 -\nβ(R + r ) = 0\n(1)\n(y - r1)2\nThis defines a best-response r1 (r 1 ) by the incumbent. When voters\nexpect them to play r 1, he would play r1 (r 1).\nClearly, the equilibrium has to be a fixed point, r1 (r 1) = r 1.\nSubstituting this into (1), we obtain\nr1 = y - ξβ(R + r )\nand the politician keeps power with probability pI = 1 , since in\nequilibrium nobody's fooled, and with probability 1/2 the politician is\nworse than average.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n27 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nCareer Concerns of Politicians\nCareer Concerns (continued)\nThis is therefore a more satisfactory model of deriving results in which\nelections appear as a method of controlling politicians.\nWe can again express the equilibrium behavior of voters as electing\nthe incumbent if\ng1 = ξβ(R + r )η ≥ ξβ(R + r )\nNevertheless, it is important to emphasize that such decision rules are\nno longer \"retrospective\" or pre-determined punishment rules; instead\nthey are derived from the forward-looking optimal behavior of the\nvoters. This, in particular, implies that even if there were costs of\nreplacing the current politician, with suffi ciently small costs, the same\nequilibrium with the rise.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n28 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nEvidence\nEvidence\nSeveral pieces of evidence in the literature point to the existence of\npolitical agency type considerations.\nIn particular, politicians behave differently depending on how much\nrents they expect from remaining in offi ce, and voters to kick out\npoliticians who (badly) misbehave.\nLet us now go over a few papers illustrating this.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n29 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nEvidence\nElectoral Accountability and Policy Choices\nBesley and Case (1995) provide differences-in-differences estimates\nfrom US governors.

But also there is\na large effect on the composition of who runs and thus becomes a\nlegislator.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n38 / 43\n\nPolitical Agency and Electoral Control\nSelection\nDiscontinuous Changes in Salaries\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 8 and 9\nOctober 2 and 4, 2017.\n39 / 43\nCourtesy of Claudio Ferraz and\nFrederico Finan.

The unit of observation is\na circle, as defined at the time of the survey (Quarter 2 of FY 2012-2013). Panel A presents instrumental variables regressions, where\ntreatment status is instrumented with randomization results. The sample consists of circles that were surveyed in the second phase of the\nsurvey(seeAppendixB).Specification includes stratum fixed effects and controls for number ofnew and reassessed properties added inthe\npre-treatment (FY 2011) fiscal year. Panels B and C present instrumental variables regressions, where treatment status is instrumented\nwith randomizationresults. Specifications follow Equation 5.6 of the main text, and includes a control for whether the response came from\nthe short version of the questionnaire. The characteristics in Panel B labelled Components of GARV are those that directly enter into\nthe formula used to calculate GARV (see Appendix B for more information). Tax Category (Panel B, Column 7) is 7-tiered categorical\nvariable with 7 being the most expensive tax bracket and 1 being the least expensive. Per-capita wages (Panel C, Column 3) is self-reported\nhousehold expenditures divided by the total number of working household members. Predicted expenditure given assets (Panel C, Column\n4) is the predicted value of a regression of household expenditure on series of dummy variables indicating various household assets. The\nInformation treatment is included in the control group in all panels. Standard errors in all panels are clustered by the robust partition of\ncircles, i.e. the group of circles such that all circles that merged or split with each other are included within the same partition. * p<0.10,\n** p<0 05 *** p<0 01\nOlken ()\nCorruption Lecture\n58 / 60\n24-27b\nCourtesy of Adnan Q.

If we wish transitivity,\npolitical power must be allocated to one individual or a set of\nindividuals with the same preferences.\nHow do we proceed?→ Restrict preferences or restrict institutions.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n11 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nArrow's Impossibility Theorem\nProof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem I\nSuppose to obtain a contradiction that there exists a non-dictatorial\nand weakly Paretian social ordering, φ, satisfying independence from\nirrelevant alternatives. Contradiction in two steps.\nStep 1: Let a set J ⊂H be strongly decisive between p1, p2 ∈P if\nfor any preference profile ρ ∈<H with p1 ≻i p2 for all i ∈J and\np2 ≻j p1 for all j ∈ H\\J , p1 ≻S p2 (H itself is strongly decisive\nsince φ is weakly Paretian).\nWe first prove that if J is strongly decisive between p1, p2 ∈P, then\nJ is dictatorial (and hence decisive for all p, p0 ∈P and for all\npreference profiles ρ ∈<H ).\nTo prove this, consider the restriction of an arbitrary preference profile\nρ ∈<H to ρ|{p1 ,p2 ,p3 } and suppose that we also have p1 ≻i p3 for all\ni ∈J .\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n12 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nArrow's Impossibility Theorem\nProof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem II\nNext consider an alternative profile ρ0\n, such that\n|{p1 ,p2,p3 }\np1 ≻i\n0 p2 ≻i\n0 p3 for all i ∈J and p2 ≻i\n0 p1 and p2 ≻i\n0 p3 for all\ni ∈ H\\J .\nSince J is strongly decisive between p1 and p2, p1 ≻0S p2.\nMoreover, since φ is weakly Paretian, we also have p2 ≻0S p3, and\nthus p1 ≻0S p2 ≻0S p3.\nNotice that ρ0\ndid not specify the preferences of individuals\n|{p1 ,p2 ,p3 }\ni ∈ H\\J between p1 and p3, but we have established p1 ≻0S p3 for\nρ0\n|{p1 ,p2 ,p3 }.\nWe can then invoke independence from irrelevant alternatives and\nconclude that the same holds for ρ|{p1 ,p2,p3 }, i.e., p1 ≻S p3.\nBut then, since the preference profiles and p3 are arbitrary, it must be\nthe case that J is dictatorial between p1 and p3.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n13 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nArrow's Impossibility Theorem\nProof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem III\nNext repeat the same argument for ρ|{p1 ,p2,p4 } and ρ0\n|{p1,p2 ,p4 }, except\nthat now p4 ≻i p2 and p4 ≻i\n0 p1 ≻i\n0 p2 for i ∈J , while p2 ≻j\n0 p1 and\np4 ≻j\n0 p1 for all j ∈ H\\J .\nThen, the same chain of reasoning, using the facts that J is strongly\ndecisive, p1 ≻0S p2, φ is weakly Paretian and satisfies independence\nfrom irrelevant alternatives, implies that J is dictatorial between p4\nand p2 (that is, p4 ≻S p2 for any preference profile ρ ∈<H ).\nNow once again using independence from irrelevant alternatives and\nalso transitivity, for any preference profile ρ ∈<H , p4 ≻i p3 for all\ni ∈J .\nSince p3, p4 ∈P were arbitrary, this completes the proof that J is\ndictatorial (i.e., dictatorial for all p, p0 ∈P).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n14 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nArrow's Impossibility Theorem\nProof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem IV\nStep 2: Given the result in Step 1, if we prove that some individual\nh ∈H is strongly decisive for some p1, p2 ∈P, we will have\nestablished that it is a dictator and thus φ is dictatorial. Let Dab be\nthe strongly decisive set between pa and pb .\nSuch a set always exists for any pa, pb ∈P, since H itself is a\nstrongly decisive set. Let D be the minimal strongly decisive set\n(meaning the strongly decisive set with the fewest members).\nThis is also well-defined, since there is only a finite number of\nindividuals in H.\nMoreover, without loss of generality, suppose that D = D12 (i.e., let\nthe strongly decisive set between p1 and p2 be the minimal strongly\ndecisive set).\nIf D a singleton, then Step 1 applies and implies that φ is dictatorial,\ncompleting the proof.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n15 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nArrow's Impossibility Theorem\nProof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem V\nThus suppose that D 6= {i}. Then, by unrestricted domain, the\nfollowing preference profile (restricted to {p1, p2, p3 }) is feasible\nfor i ∈D\np1 ≻i p2 ≻i p3\nfor j ∈ D\\ {i}\np3 ⪰j p1 ≻j p2\nfor k /\np2 ≻k p3 ≻k p1.\n∈D\nBy hypothesis D is strongly decisive between p1 and p2. Thus\np1 ≻S p2.\nNext if p3 ≻S p2, then given the preference profile here, D\\ {i}\nwould be strongly decisive between p2 and p3, and this would\ncontradict that D is the minimal strongly decisive set.\nThus p2 %S p3. Combined with p1 ≻S p2, this implies p1 ≻S p3. But\ngiven the preference profile here, this implies that {i} is strongly\ndecisive, yielding another contradiction.\nTherefore, the minimal strongly decisive set must be a singleton {h}\nfor some h ∈H. Then, from Step 1, {h} is a dictator and φ is\ndictatorial, completing the proof.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n16 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nVoting and the Condorcet Paradox\nVoting\nCould be voting help?\nNo because Arrow's Theorem already covers voting.\nBut voting may impose additional \"institutional structure\"\nBut in fact the Condorcet paradox has many of the same features as\nArrow's Theorem.\nThis was anticipated by the great and indomitable Marquis de\nCondorcet.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n17 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nVoting and the Condorcet Paradox\nThe Condorcet Paradox\nImagine a society consisting of three individuals, 1, 2, and 3, three\nchoices and preferences\n1 a ≻ c ≻ b\n2 b ≻ a ≻ c\n3 c ≻ b ≻ a\nAssume \"open agenda direct democracy\" system.\nA1.

This will be the cost of\nredistributive taxation in this model.\nLet l denote average labor supply. Since the average of αi is α, we\nhave l = L(τ). The government budget constraint can therefore be\nwritten:\nT ≤ τl ≡ τL(τ).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n41 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nApplication: Redistributive Taxation\nApplication: Redistributive Taxation III\nLet U(τ; αi ) be utility for αi from tax τ with T determined as\nresidual. By straightforward substitution into the individual utility\nfunction, we can express the policy preferences of individual i as\nU(τ; αi ) ≡ L(τ) + h(α - L(τ)) + (1 - τ)(αi - α).\n(1)\nAre the preferences represented by (1) single-peaked?\nThe answer depends on the shape of the average labor supply\nfunction L(τ). By putting enough structure on dysfunction, we could\nensure that U(τ; αi ) is strictly concave or quasi concave, thus\nsatisfying single-peakedness. However, this function could be\nsuffi ciently convex that U(τ; αi ) could have multiple peaks (multiple\nlocal maxima). As a result, preferences may not be single peaked.\nBut it is straightforward to verify that (1) satisfies the single-crossing\nproperty.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nPolitical Economy Lectures 1 and 2\nSeptember 6 and 11, 2017.\n42 / 64\n\nCollective Choice and Static Voting Models\nApplication: Redistributive Taxation\nApplication: Redistributive Taxation IV\nTherefore, we can apply MVT, and party competition gives\nτm = arg max U(τ; αm )\nτ\nHence, we have\nL0(τm )\n\n1 - h0(α - L(τm ))\n- (αm - α) = 0\n(2)\nIf the mean is greater than the median, as we should have for a\nskewed distribution of income, it must be the case that αm - α < 0\n(that is median productivity must be less than mean productivity).\nThis implies that τm > 0- otherwise, (2) would be satisfied for a\nnegative tax rate, and we would be at a corner solution with zero\ntaxes (unless negative tax rates, i.e., subsidies, were allowed).\nNow imagine a change in the distribution of α such that the difference\nbetween the mean and the median widens.

      "content": "14.770-Fall 2017\nRecitation 1 Notes\nArda Gitmez\nSeptember 8, 2017\nToday:\n- A short review of the first lecture and concepts.\n- A close cousin of Arrow's Impossibility result: the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem.\nWhat Happened in the First Lecture\nIn many ways, it's a pretty standard \"Introduction to Political Economy\" lecture.\n- Politics: the art of aggregating preferences.1\n- Of course, the first question is: is it possible to aggregate preferences?\n- (Spoiler: it isn't.)\n- Let's formalize this question a little bit.\n- Assume a group of people, H, have well-defined (complete, reflexive, transitive) preferences over\npolicies.2\n- Can we create an \"aggregation machine\" to which we put these preferences, and it spits out one\nwell-defined (transitive) preference profile over policies (reflecting the preferences for the whole\ngroup)?\n- Such an aggregation machine is also often named a \"Social Welfare Function\".\n- Some features we would expect from the aggregation machine (aka axioms):\n∗ Weakly Paretian. If everyone prefers one policy over the other, the society should too.\n∗ Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). The comparisons can be reduced to\npairwise ones.\n- Arrow's Impossibility Theorem: The only such aggregation machine is the dictatorial rule -\nwhich, come to think of it, is not an \"aggregation machine\" at all.\n∗ Is this a commentary on the difficulty of group decision-making, or a commentary on how\ndemanding the features we expect are (in particular, IIA)?\n∗ A depressing result at first, but also hugely influential: gave rise to 30 years of literature on\nsocial choice.\n1A very loose definition, I know.\n2These preferences can come from anywhere (see L. Notes slides 4 and 5 for a treatment), but the crucial thing is that the\npreference domain is unrestricted - i.e. they can be anything.\n\n∗ Most importantly: it gave rise to the class you're taking now. If such an aggregation machine\ncould be found, there would be no need for a full-semester class on political economy!\n- The other depressing result we covered: Condorcet Paradox.\n- In words: \"Voting isn't a good way to aggregate preferences, as it may lead to cycles.\"\n- Not really surprising given Arrow: indeed, this is a corollary of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.\n(Why?)\n- Next question: OK, but can we get around Arrow? When can we have a meaningful prediction on\ngroup decision making?\n- Obviously, we should revisit the model. One feature of the model is: the preference domain is\nunrestricted. This is usually a feature that the impossibility results heavily rely on, because those\nproofs always go like: \"But what happens when people have these preferences?\"\n- Let's drop the unrestrictedness assumption, and place some restriction/structure on preferences.\n- Two such restrictions: (i) single-peakedness and (ii) single-crossing.\n- Reasonable? Sometimes, but we're making these assumptions mostly because they are what work\nmathematically.\n- Following this restriction, next big result of the lecture: Median Voter Theorem (MVT).\n- When preferences are single-peaked, there are no Condorcet cycles. Consequently, voting works!\n- Works with sincere voting, but also with strategic voting, i.e. we should not worry about people\nlying. (Subject to some caveats we covered in the lecture.)\n- Another variant of the MVT: Downsian Convergence Theorem.\n- Same idea. When preferences are single-peaked, the median voter's most preferred policy is\nimplemented.\nWhat You Should Remember About the First Lecture\nIt is a brief but valuable intro: try to keep in mind the intellectual flow of the lecture. \"Group decision\nmaking is hard, but if people have sufficiently structured preferences, voting is a pretty good tool for decision\nmaking.\"\nThe concepts you should remember:\n1. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem (and how IIA is crucial and controversial)\n2. Condorcet Paradox\n3. Median Voter Theorem and Downsian Convergence Theorem\nThe next few lectures really build on the theoretical ideas we developed here: we will discuss whether people\nhave really single-peaked preferences, whether people vote strategically, whether Downsian convergence really\noccurs etc.\nSome Extra: Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem\nYou may have the following reaction upon seeing Arrow's Impossibility Theorem:\n\n\"OK, but why are we insisting on finding a whole preference profile (i.e. a ranking over all\npossible policies)? Don't we just need to choose one policy?\"\nIn other words, why don't we have a \"choice machine\" rather than an \"aggregation machine\"? This seems\npromising, but unfortunately it wouldn't work either: Gibbard-Satterthwaite (G-S) tells us that the only\n\"choice machine\" which satisfies certain desirable properties is again dictatorial.\nTwo main differences between G-S and Arrow:\n1. As hinted above, G-S is about \"choice machines\" (i.e. Social Choice Functions) rather than \"aggrega\ntion machines\" (i.e. Social Welfare Functions).\n2. G-S is about incomplete information, i.e. it takes into account that people may lie about their prefer\nences (much like the second version of MVT we covered in the lecture).\nLet's formulate these ideas and the theorem mathematically.\n- Let H be the (finite) set of people, and let P be the (finite) set of policies.\n- As in the lecture, let R be the set of all weak orders on P.\n- Note: as in Arrow, preference domain is again unrestricted.\n- Each individual i ∈H has preferences Ri ∈ R. Consequently, a preference profile has the form\nρ = (R1, . . . , R|H|) ∈ R|H|.\nDefinition 1. A Social Choice Function f is a function\nf : R|H| →P\nThat is, it takes a preference profile ρ as its input and chooses an policy f(ρ) ∈P.\nWhat are some desirable features of a Social Choice Function? We will state two: Pareto efficiency and\nStrategy-Proofness. Let's start with Pareto efficiency.\nDefinition 2. Given a preference profile ρ ∈ R|H|, a policy p ∈P is Pareto optimal if there is no other\npolicy p0 ∈P such that\np 0 ⪰i p\nfor all i ∈H\nand\np 0 ≻j p\nfor some j ∈H.\nThis is the very standard notion of Pareto optimality: there exists no other policy that everybody weakly\nprefers and at least one agent strictly prefers.\nDefinition 3. A Social Choice Function f is Pareto efficient if, for any preference profile ρ ∈ R|H|, f(ρ)\nis Pareto optimal.\nPretty reasonable, huh? The other desirable feature we have, strategy-proofness, is also quite reasonable.\nDefinition 4. A Social Choice Function f is strategy-proof if, for any preference profile ρ = (R1, . . . , R|H|) ∈\nR|H|, any individual i ∈H and any preference R0 ∈ R,\ni\nf(ρ) ⪰i f(R1, . . . , Ri-1, Ri\n0 , Ri+1, . . . , R|H|)\nThat is, individual i cannot strictly benefit from pretending that her preferences are Ri\n0 .\nThis is also a pretty standard requirement: indeed, whenever there is incomplete information, some kind of\n\"truth-telling\" requirement needs to be imposed.3\n3There's a huge story behind this I can't cover within this lecture - you should take 14.281 or 14.125 for the treatment it\ndeserves!\n\nDefinition 5. A Social Choice Function f is dictatorial if there exists an agent i ∈H such that, for any\nρ = (R1, . . . , R|H|) ∈ R|H|, f(ρ) is the most preferred policy for Ri.\nNow we are ready to state the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem.\nTheorem 1. (Gibbard-Satterthwaite). If |P| ≥ 3, then any Pareto efficient and strategy-proof Social\nChoice Function is necessarily dictatorial.\nSome commentary on this theorem:\n- Why do we need |P| ≥ 3? Can you find a Pareto efficient, strategy-proof and nondictatorial Social\nChoice Function when |P| = 2?\n- Once again: is this a commentary on the difficulty of group decision-making, or a commentary on how\ndemanding strategy-proofness is?\n- It should be apparent that this result is closely connected to Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Their\nproofs are really similar too! Indeed, there is an illuminating paper by Phil Reny (Economics Letters,\n2001) titled \"Arrow's Theorem and the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem: A Unified Approach\" which\ngives the proofs side-by-side.\nIf you feel like you need a resource to revisit the issues discussed today, Mas-Collel, Whinston and Green's\nChapter 21 and (first half of) Chapter 23 are good places to look at.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.770 Introduction to Political Economy\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.770-Fall 2017\nRecitation 10 Notes\nArda Gitmez\nDecember 8, 2017\nToday: \"Why incentives can backfire\"\n- Holmstrom and Milgrom's multitasking model (1991, JLEO)\n- Two papers by Benabou and Tirole (2003, REStud and 2006, AER)\nBut first, some motivation: recall that in class, we argued that high pay for bureaucrats may be detrimental\nbecause it may attract the wrong pool of applicants. That's the screening story - today, I'll talk about\nan alternative theory based on incentives. (For more econ minded folks, this is getting closer to adverse\nselection vs moral hazard dichotomy.)\nI'll talk about two strand of models:\n- The famous \"multitasking\" model by Holmstrom and Milgrom. Basically, a higher monetary incentive\ncan \"shift\" agent's efforts towards \"wrong\" activities. Consider teachers spending all their time on\nteaching kids how to excel at tests, and no social skills.\n- The \"intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation\" models by Benabou and Tirole. Here, providing monetary\nincentivizes for an action may indeed reduce the supply of the action, because agents are concerned\nwith looking like they do the action just because they want to do it, not because they're paid to do it.\nMany examples of this - see below.\nThe Multitasking Model\nThe multitasking model is a very famous one among theorists - it's also such a simple insight that sometimes\nit's difficult to appreciate how powerful it is. Below is a very very simplified version of the multitasking model:\n- Two individuals: a principal and an agent. (Consider government and the teacher.)\n- Two tasks: 1 and 2. (Consider teaching how to take tests and teaching social skills.)\n- Agent chooses how much effort to spend on each task (a1, a2) ∈ R2\n- Principal observes a single-dimensional measure of total effort s = μ1a1 +μ2a2 +ε, μ1, μ2 > 0. (Consider\na composite exam score - can also add noise.)\n- Principal makes a transfer based on the signal: t(s) = αs + β. (Performance-based pay.)\n- A higher α corresponds to \"high-powered incentives\".\n- We'll look for the optimal α chosen by the principal, i.e. the wage contract.\n- The linearity of contract is obviously restrictive, but there are justifications for it beyond the\nscope of this lecture.\n\nPrincipal's payoff:\nB1a1 + B2a2 - t(s)\nwhere B1, B2 > 0 are the \"benefits\". (Consider the relative social benefits from having children who know\nhow to take tests and children with high social skills.)\nAgent's payoff:\na\na\nt(s) -\n-\na\nWhere the 2\ni term is the cost of action. Note that, due to the additive cost function, the two effort levels\nare substitutes.\nAs usual in the moral hazard literature, we'll do the analysis in two steps:\n1. Given (α, β), what's the action that agents take? Clearly, looking at agent's payoff function and taking\nFOCs:\nai(α) = μiα\nfor i = 1, 2.\nSince β is just a lump-sum transfer, it doesn't enter into this. Heuristically, the agent spends more\neffort on an action if it's more visible. (Plausibly μi is higher for testing skills than it is for social\nskills.)\n2. Given ai(α), what's the best α? The principal solves:\nmax B1a1 + B2a2 - (μ1a1 + μ2a2)\nα\nsubject to\nai = μiα\nfor i = 1, 2.\nTaking FOCs and rearranging yields:\nB1μ1 + B2μ2\n||B||\nα ∗ =\n=\ncos θ\nμ1 + μ\n||μ||\nα∗ is high when (B1, B2) and (μ1, μ2) vectors are congruent. Heuristically, high-powered incentives are\ngood when what principal cares about is also what principal measures. However, this is a very demanding\nassumption: the composite exam score does not necessarily reflect the socially optimal combination of test-\ntaking skills and social skills! In that case, high-powered incentive would backfire: teachers would substitute\naway from teaching social skills and spend too much time on teaching test-taking skills!\nIncentives and Prosocial Behavior\nThis is a long paper - I'll only cover the gist of it here. The basic idea is simple: agents have concerns for\nsocial reputation or self-respect, and consequently they want to signal that they are altruistic type. They\ncan:\n- Signal their type by working hard even if pay is low.\n- Nevertheless, the signaling value of such an action decreases when individuals are paid to work hard,\nso we may end up with lower effort.\nThat is, extrinsic incentives may crowd out intrinsic motivation. Some examples of such crowding out:\n\n- Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) found that schoolchildren collected less money when given performance\nincentives.\n- Titmuss (1970) argued that paying blood donors could reduces the supply\n- Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) \"A Fine is a Price\" found that fining parents for picking up their children\nlate from day-care centres resulted in more late arrivals.\nHere's a basic model which may explain such phenomenon. There is only one action a. Each individual\nselects a participation level a from choice set A ⊂ R. Participation is not free: there is an effort cost C (a).\nAssume that there is a material reward ya for choosing a.\nLet νa and νy denote agent's intrinsic valuations for contributing to the social good and for money (greed),\nso contribution gives a benefit of\n(νa + νy y) a - C (a)\nIndividuals' types v = (νa, νy) ∈ R2 are drawn independently from f (v) with mean ( νa, ν y ). As usual, types\nare private information.\nIn this model, decisions carry reputational costs and benefits, i.e. there is a value of reputation. Such value\nmay be instrumental (e.g. marriage market) or affective (shame as hedonic good) - we'll remain agnostic\nabout it. Assume the following functional form for reputational benefits:\nr (a, y) = μaE (νa | a, y) - μy E (νy | a, y) , μa ≥ 0, μy ≥ 0\nso that the decision problem of agent is:\nmax {(νa + νy y) a - C (a) + μaE (νa | a, y) - μyE (νy | a, y)}\na∈A\nThe FOC gives us\n∂E (νa | a, y)\n∂E (νy | a, y)\nC0 (a) = νa + νyy + μa\n- μy\n∂a\n∂a\nJust through eyeballing, you can see that optimal a reveals three motivations: intrinsic, extrinsic and\nreputational.\nThe reputation is hardwired into this equation because individuals try to infer νa and νy from the actions\ntaken. Here's a critical observation: A higher incentive rate y reduces informativeness of actions about νa,\nbut increases it about νy . In other words, stronger incentives may reduce effort because high effort in this\ncase makes you look greedy.\nHere's a graph which captures it all:\n\nThere are two reputational effects in equilibrium in this graph:\n- New high-contributors have lower νa's than old ones - they drag down the group's reputation for\nprosocial orientation.\n- New high-contributors are \"greedy\" types whereas those who still contribute below a after the reward\nis introduced reveal that they case less about money than average.\nThe net effect of a financial reward therefore is ambiguous: supply curve of contributions can be locally\ndownward or upward-sloping.\nHere's a more formal analysis:\n- Assume C (a) = ka2 .\n- Valuations νa, νy distributed normally with covariance σay\nIn this case, standard results for normal random variables yield\nE (νa | a, y) = ν a + ρ (y) · (ka - ν a - ν yy - r (a, y))\nE (νy | a, y) = ν y + χ (y) · (ka - ν a - ν y y - r (a, y))\nwhere\nσ2 + yσay\n1 - ρ (y)\na\nρ (y) =\n, χ (y) =\nσ2 + 2yσay + y2σ2\ny\na\ny\nNote that ρ (0) = 1: when there are no financial rewards, actions are fully informative about νa.\nProposition 1. There is a unique (differentiable-reputation) equilibrium, in which an agent with preferences\n(νa, νy) contributes at the level\nνa + νyy\na =\n+ μaρ (y) - μyχ (y)\nk\nIn this case, higher y increases agents' direct payoff from contributing but reduces associated signaling value\nalong both dimensions. Incentives indeed backfire over some range (provided sufficient reputational concern),\nsee:\nCopyright Roland Benabou,\nJean Tirole, and the\nAmerican Economic\nAssociation reproduced\nwith permission of the\nAmerican Economic\nReview.\n\nIntrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation\nLet me just tell you the story of the model, and you can read about it if you want to.\nWe have the 14.770 Final Exam in ∼ 10 days from now on. You'll choose how much to study for the final;\nand clearly both you and me want you to do well in the final.\nTo be honest, I've seen (at least part of) the final exam by now, so I know how difficult it would be. So\nhow would you feel if I suddenly came up, picked one of you and told \"I'll pay you $ 100 if you take a 90 or\nabove from the final\"?\n- On the one hand, this incentivizes you to work harder for final for obvious reasons.\n- On the other hand, this statement says something about the difficulty of the final and my perception\nabout the person I picked - it plausibly tells you that I know the final exam is difficult, and that person\nneeds some extra incentives to work enough for the final. But this may discourage him from studying\nas well!\nWhich effect dominates? Depends, but it's easy to come up with scenarios where offering additional mone\ntary incentives can backfire.\nDisclaimer: I'll not pay anything to any of you, regardless of your performance in the final exam.\nHow do you feel now?

      "content": "14.770-Fall 2017\nRecitation 2 Notes\nArda Gitmez\nSeptember 15, 2017\nToday:\n- A brief review of the second and third lectures.\n- Going over Feddersen and Pesendorfer (APSR, 1998) once more.\nA Helicopter Tour of the Class\nLecture 2 mostly builds on the first lecture, introducing two key ideas you should remember:\n1. Single-Crossing Preferences. A restriction on preferences much in the same vein as single-peakedness.\nJust like single-peakedness, it ensures that MVT and Donwsian Convergence holds.\n- Unlike single-peakedness, this is a property of the whole preference profile, not an individual's\npreference.\n- Neither of them implies the other!\n- Easier than single-peakedness to check in some applications, e.g. redistributive taxation.\n2. Probabilistic Voting. The \"smoothed out\" version of electoral competition model - so that we get\ncontinuous best responses.\n- Turns out this is also a model which predicts why parties tend to cater towards swing voters.\n- Useful, but sometimes you need to place extreme restrictions, e.g. uniform distributions, to make\nit tractable.\n- If interested, Persson and Tabellini's Section 3.4 is a good resource to check.\nLecture 3, on the other hand, shifts gears a little bit.\n- Lectures 1 and 2 take the assumption that \"everybody has individual, heterogeneous preferences\n(private values)\" as given.\n- Sometimes a reasonable assumption (redistributive taxation?)...\n- But sometimes, a policy has a \"common interest\" element (trade liberalization?)...\n- In these cases, there is no conflict of preferences, but perhaps a conflict of information.\n- So, let's take one extreme and consider a model where everybody has the same preferences\n(common values), but different information.\n\n- Real life is probably somewhere in between private preferences and common values, but it's really\nintractable.1\n- Somewhat interestingly, these models share a lot of features with the models on common value\nauctions.\n- In a common value auction, bidders place their bids conditional on winning. In a common value\npolicy choice, voters cast their votes conditional on being pivotal. In both cases, these events\n(winning or being pivotal) contain useful information.\n- Not surprising that Pesendorfer also wrote a group of highly influential papers on auction theory!\n- Fun fact: \"Swing Voter's Curse\" is a pun on \"Winner's Curse\" - a well-known concept in common\nvalue auctions.\n- In today's recitation, we'll cover an example where things may go in counterintuitive directions, because\npeople realize that being pivotal is valuable information.\n- That's all for the theoretical analysis of voting (for now)! Next few lectures will focus on empirics -\ntesting the theories laid out by the theoretical models we covered so far.\nThe Jury Problem (Feddersen-Pesendorfer 1998)\n- Folk wisdom about jury verdicts, which require unanimous agreement on conviction:\n\"Trial by jury is not an instrument of getting at the truth; it is a process designed to make\nit as sure as possible that no innocent man is convicted.\"\n- This seems to be the correct heuristic when people vote sincerely (everybody brings their partial\ninformation to the table, we aggregate, and the law of large numbers kicks in).\n- Not so much when people act strategically - i.e. when they realize being pivotal contains some infor\nmation.\n- Intuitively: if you are a juror, you realize that the only scenario when your vote will matter is: when\nall other eleven people vote for conviction. That's a very strong set of signals to overturn!\nThe Model\nWhat we covered in the lecture:\n- State of the world θ ∈{I, G}\n- Pr{θ = G} = π ∈ (0, 1)\n- n jurors, each receive signal s ∈{i, g}\n- Each signal iid conditional on state\n- Pr{s = g|θ = G} = p, p > 0.5\n- Pr{s = i|θ = I} = q, q > 0.5\n- Each juror would like to convict if and only if\nPr{θ = G|information} ≥ z\nwhere z ∈ [0, 1] is the threshold of reasonable doubt.\n1Auction theory has spent a lot of time figuring out the correct way to model this midpoint (Google \"affiliated values\" if\ninterested), and believe me it's not easy.\n\nDefine β(k, n) as the posterior probability that the defendant is guilty conditional on observing k guilty\nsignals out of n:\nπpk(1 - p)n-k\nβ(k, n) = πpk(1 - p)n-k + (1 - π)(1 - q)kqn-k\nThe following assumption ensures that the model is interesting:\nAssumption 1. There is a k∗ with n ≥ k∗ ≥ 1, such that\nβ(k ∗ - 1, n) < z < β(k ∗ , n)\nIn layman's terms, this assumption says that \"the collective information of all jurors matter\".\nSincere Voting\nWe are interested in whether the folk wisdom holds; in other words:\n\"What is the probability that θ = G conditional on conviction?\"\nLet's first answer this question by assuming that the jurors simply tell what their signals are without being\nstrategic. In this case, the posterior probability conditional on conviction (i.e. n guilty signals) is:\nπpn\nβ(n, n) = πpn + (1 - π)(1 - q)n\nSince p, q > 0.5, this converges to 1 as n →inf. In other words, the unanimity rule ensures that no innocent\nman gets convicted! (Under sincere voting, of course.)\nStrategic Voting\nDo the reasoning above hold under strategic voting, too? That is, is sincere voting an equilibrium?\n- If k∗ = n, yes. But this is a very demanding condition!\n- If k∗ < n, no. This is because then we have:\nβ(n - 1, n) > z\n(1)\nThat is, conditional on a juror being pivotal, she believes that the defendant is guilty even when her\nprivate signal says otherwise, so she votes for conviction. (Consistent with the intuition we provided\nearlier!)\nFor the rest of the analysis, we'll assume that Equation 1 holds.\nAnalysis of Equilibrium\nThe power of a game theoretical model is: it can go beyond being cynical about some other predictions, and\nmake its own! So, let's use this machinery to analyze what happens.\nSome notes:\n- Let's look for a symmetric Bayesian Nash Equilibrium of the game induced by this setup.\n- There's always an equilibrium where everyone votes acquit regardless of their signals. This is not an\ninteresting one, and perhaps not very realistic.\n\n- Is there an equilibrium where everyone votes convict regardless of the signal? Not if\nπ(1 - p)\n< z\n(2)\nπ(1 - p) + (1 - π)q\nand this is an easy condition to satisfy.\n- A symmetric strategy profile is given by\n(σ(i), σ(g)) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1]\nwhere σ(s) is the probability of voting to convict after observing signal s ∈{i, g}.\n- Define the probabilities of conviction vote by a juror in both states:\nγG = pσ(g) + (1 - p)σ(i)\nγI = (1 - q)σ(g) + qσ(i)\nWe're looking for a responsive equilibrium where γG 6\nγI .\n=\nThat is, a juror's vote must be infor\nmative of its signal (to some extent, if not fully).\nStart by realizing that we cannot have a responsive equilibrium with σ(g) < 1.\n1. You can check that, if a juror who receives s = g weakly prefers to acquit, then a juror who receives\ns = i strictly prefers to acquit.\n2. In other words, we need to have σ(i) = 0.\n3. But remember, being pivotal means n - 1 other conviction votes. Since only those who receive s = g\nvotes to convict, this means n - 1 other guilty signals.\n4. As long as Equation 1 holds, this cannot be an equilibrium, for the same reason why sincere voting\ncannot be an equilibrium.\nSo, we pinned down σ(g) = 1. What about σ(i)?\n1. It cannot be 0 (as long as Equation 1 holds) and it cannot be 1 (as long as Equation 2 holds) either!\n2. For σ(i) ∈ (0, 1), we need an indifference condition:\nπ(γG)n-1(1 - p)\n= z\nπ(γG)n-1(1 - p) + (1 - π)(γI )n-1q\nOr, more explicitly:\nπ(p + (1 - p)σ(i))n-1(1 - p)\n= z\nπ(p + (1 - p)σ(i))n-1(1 - p) + (1 - π)((1 - q) + qσ(i))n-1q\nOne can then back out σ(i) from this equation. As long as Equations 1 and 2 are satisfied, we have\nσ(i) ∈ [0, 1].\nFeddersen and Pesendorfer analyze the case where π = 0.5 and p = q. In this case,\n\n1/(n-1)\n(1-z)(1-p)\nzp\np - (1 - p)\nσ(i) =\n\n1/(n-1)\n(1-z)(1-p)\np -\nzp\n(1 - p)\nThis is a nice, closed form solution, and one can calculate the probability that an innocent defendant gets\nconvicted. Spoiler: it does not converge to zero. The following figure plots it for π = 0.5, p = q = 0.7 and\nz = 0.5.\n\n(c) The American Political Science Association. All rights reserved.

For more information, see\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use/\nSAD. :(\nNon-Unanimous Rules\nIf even unanimous verdicts sometimes convict innocent defendants, what is a rule which doesn't?\nBased on the analysis so far, you should be able to guess the answer:\n\"Literally any other rule which requires only a fraction α ∈ (0, 1) of conviction votes.\"\nWhy? I'm not going to give the whole answer here, but only some intuition.\nFix some α ∈ (0, 1). In a responsive symmetric Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, a juror who receives s = i\nmust again be indifferent when she is pivotal. This requires:\nπ(γG)αn(1 - γG)(1-α)n(1 - p)\n= z\nπ(γG)αn(1 - γG)(1-α)n(1 - p) + (1 - π)(γI )αn(1 - γI )(1-α)nq\nThe only way this doesn't blow up or vanish as n →inf is:\n(γG)α(1 - γG)1-α\n= 1\n(γI )α(1 - γI )1-α\nThis, along with the fact that γG > γI , implies that we must have:\nγG > α > γI\nBut then, when θ = G, a fraction γG > α votes are in favor of conviction, so the juror convicts with\nprobability 1! Similar argument goes for θ = I. Note that the above argument doesn't work with α = 1 - in\nthat case, both γG and γI would need to be close to one.\nFinally, note that the assumption of large n is crucial for above reasoning to work - so, rather than dealing\nwith particulars of the α, maybe one should just increase the size of the jury.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.770 Introduction to Political Economy\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.770-Fall 2017\nRecitation 3 Notes\nArda Gitmez\nSeptember 22, 2017\nToday:\nA discussion of\n\"Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government\"\nby Achen and Bartels.\nA Brief Review of the Book\nThe spirit of the book is much in line with the themes of this week's lectures.\n- In Lectures 1-3, we covered some theoretical models of how/why electoral politics work.\n- Lectures 4 and 5 were then about whether these models' predictions hold in real life.\n- Results are mixed: Downsian convergence in its strongest form usually doesn't hold, but there\nsome responsiveness to voters' preferences as well.\nAchen and Bartels take a stronger (and to some extent, more provocative) view of the theoretical views of\nelectoral politics.\nThe book starts by laying out the benchmark theoretical model of electoral politics (or, in Achen and Bartels'\nwords, \"folk theory of democracy\" - each voter votes for the best alternative for herself and we agree on a\npolicy which is an agreeable compromise for everybody).\nIt then proceeds to argue why the folk theory does not hold in real life. Most broadly, I'd say the book is\ncomprised of three parts.\n1. The first part of the book (Chapters 2 and 3) demonstrate why electoral politics -in the sense we\nhave thought about so far- does not work. It may not work in a setup where political parties act as\n\"intermediaries\" between voters' preferences and policies, and it may not work when voters directly\nvote on policies (rather than politicians).\n- These two chapters are most closely related to this week's themes of class.\n2. The second part (Chapters 4 through 7) take an alternative view of electoral politics: the \"keeping\npoliticians accountable\" model. It does not work either: people sometimes punish politicians for things\nthey cannot possibly control, or act myopically in evaluating a politician's performance.\n- This is more closely related to the idea of \"political agency\", which we will start covering in\nLecture 8.\n\n3. The authors utilize the last part (Chapters 8 through 11) to set forth their view of electoral politics (and\ndemocracy in general) the \"group theory\" model of voter behavior. Voters do not exist in the world\nas human beings with their own exogenously given preferences: instead, they start off by identifying\nthemselves as the member of a group and then form their preferences/beliefs based on this identity.\n- A nod to the recent discussion on the prevalence of \"identity politics\". This theory is grounded\nin psychology/sociology, so perhaps more knowledge of behavioral economics would help an\neconomist to grasp it better.\nI plan to spend most of the discussion on the first part of the book - not because other parts are less inter\nesting, but because it is more closely related to our lectures so far.\nBelow are some random thoughts/my small notes upon reading the book to start the conversation.\nLet's Discuss!\n- Do you think the models we have covered so far are positive or normative?\n- The way the class is structured so far (Arrow first, MVT and Downsian convergence later, etc.)\nmakes us think like it's more positive: we're trying to make some predictions on what outcomes\nelectoral politics would produce.\n- One important contribution of Achen and Bartels is to place these theories within historical\ncontext. It \"flips around\" the order in which these theories came up, and helps us see the\nnormative side of MVT/Downsian Convergence clearer. With this interpretation, Arrow is a\ntheoretical response to the optimist conclusions of the folk theory.\n- Chapter 2: I've taken notes of three observations on why, in practice, electoral politics won't work\neither because voters don't know what's best for them. These are: (i) framing effects, (ii) ignorance,\n(iii) the \"reverse causality\" of rhetoric/persuasion.\n- Can \"better theory\" capture and incorporate these observations? If so, would it still have predic\ntive power?\n- Is there a risk of coming off as paternalistic upon making these type of observations?\n- Chapter 3: the discussion about historical evolution of \"republic vs democracy\" is neat and interesting.\nHow should we really define democracy anyway? (This question appears repeatedly throughout the\nbook - even though I tend to read this is a book on electoral politics, not on democracy as a whole.)\n- Chapter 3: What do you think about the authors' discussion on the history of referendums in the US?\n- Is there too much capture? Do people frequently vote for what's worse for them? Once again, is\nthere a way to make these observations without coming off as paternalistic?\n- I personally think that a usually overlooked reason why we should be suspicious about referendums\nas a democratic device is: they are almost always \"yes/no\" questions, killing future possibilities\nof further discussion/compromise. (Once again this goes back to the earlier question on what the\ndefining feature of a democracy is - and I sense that the thesis laid in the last part is related to\nthis.)\n- On \"restrospective voting\": what do you think about the empirics there? How can we be sure, for\ninstance, that the voters don't punish the incumbents for not responding strongly enough to negative\nshocks? (They have an answer for this question in the book - I'm not entirely sure if I buy it.)\n- On \"identity politics\": how should we place this view in the post-truth era?\n- Suppose this psychological model of identity formation is true. Is it something we should be concerned\nabout?\n\n- Once again, is it positive or normative?\n- It seems like people who are really affected by a policy align themselves in their interests (consider\nthe example about the abortion debate). A reason to worry less?\n- What about outside of the US?\n- If we end up believing in the authors, what should we conclude? Should we have \"more democracy\"\nor \"less democracy\"? What does \"more democracy\" mean anyway? (For authors' response to these\nquestions -which are well-articulated and I firmly agree- check Chapter 11.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.770 Introduction to Political Economy\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.770-Fall 2017\nRecitation 4 Notes\nArda Gitmez\nOctober 6, 2017\nToday:\n- A review of the week.\n- Another take on Acemoglu, Golosov and Tsyvinski (2008, Ecma).\n- The theoretical model of Ferraz and Finan (2011, AER) - actually more like the model of Besley\n(2006).\nWhat's Happening in This Class?\nMost generally, we're done with the first one-third of Daron's lectures - those about electoral politics. We\ncovered:\n(i) the theoretical models: Median Voter Theorem, Downsian Convergence, probabilistic voting, swing\nvoter's curse...\n(ii) empirical evidence: tests of strategic voting, Downsian Convergence, policy responsiveness...\n(iii) some further ideas on why things may not go as smoothly as predicted by the theoretical models:\nlobbying, vote buying, clientelism, populism...\nNow we're in the second one-third: those about politicians. The fancy name for these lectures is political\nagency, because we're treating the voters as principals and politicians as agents. Very similarly:\n(i) We covered the theoretical models: the models where elections work as a disciplining device on politicians.\nTwo broad classes of models here:\n1. Those where voters punish the politicians if they fails to deliver. Three examples:\n- The Barro-Ferejohn baseline model with complete information and stationary equilibrium.\n- The incomplete information model with stationary equilibrium.\n- The Acemoglu-Golosov-Tsyvinski (2008) model with complete information and nonstationary\nequilibrium (also, endogenous production).\n2. Those where voters choose politicians who deliver, because they believe they're better politicians\n- and politicians thus have an incentive to deliver, because they want to stay in office. Two\nexamples:\n- The career concerns model.\n- Today's adverse selection model by Besley (2006).\n(ii) We covered some empirical evidence: effects of term length, scrutiny, renumeration...\n\n(iii) Next lecture, we will cover why things may not go as smoothly.\nBeginning the week after that, we'll start the last one-third of Daron's part: those who analyze how policies\nare determined. We'll cover models of legislative bargaining, political compromise etc.\nToday, I'll zoom in to two of the bullet points mentioned above.\nAcemoglu, Golosov and Tsyvinski (2008)\nThere are three reasons why I'm covering this model today:\n1. The Barro-Ferejohn models of political agency focus on stationary strategies. As we discussed in\nthe lecture, non-stationary equilibria has interesting features: the possibility of backloading (i.e.\npromising more payments in the future if the politician behaves well in the short term) may make the\nvoters better off - because it incentivizes the politician better and because there is more consumption\ntoday. Of course, backloading may not work if the politician is impatient.\n- This model generates exactly these predictions: the optimal SPE features backloading (i.e. politi\ncian's per period payoff increasing over time) as long as the politician is not impatient.\n2. The Barro-Ferejohn models do not have a notion of productive efficiency: the output is given\nendogenous. Productive efficiency seems to be a relevant concern: if voters know that the politician\nwill steal, they don't have much incentives to work hard. Therefore, the possibility of politician\nbehaving badly introduces output distortions. Should we worry about these distortions?\n- This model, by introducing endogenous production, shows that the output distortions vanish in\nthe long term as long as the politician is not impatient.\n3. Technically, this is an analysis which relies on the recursive dynamic programming approach - a\nuseful tool for dynamic games and for future lectures as well. Good to know!\nThe Model\nWe discussed this in the lecture, so I'll just repeat the basics:\nCitizen (per period) utility:\nu(g) - h(y)\ny is the output (produced by citizens), h(y) is the (convex) cost. g is public good, u(g) is the (concave)\nutility. Think of a world where citizens produce everything and hand them in to the politician, and then\npolitician decides how much of the output to return in the form of public goods. Consequently, what's left\nto the politician is y - g.\n- Note: the productive efficiency (what would happen in the absence of politician) requires that y = g\nand u0(g) - h0(y) = 0 every period.\nPolitician (per period) utility from y - g:\nv(y - g)\n- v(.) is concave. This is important: if utility was linear, the citizens would keep promising larger and\nlarger (unbounded) payoffs to the politician in the future, and ensure that y = g in all periods.\nAssume that citizens have a discount factor β ∈ (0, 1), and the politician has a discount factor δ ∈ (0, 1).\n- The model in class assumed β = δ, but I'm giving the more general version here, because I also want\nto discuss what happens when politician is impatient (δ < β).\n\nThe equilibrium is not stationary anymore, so everything is indexed by time:\n(yt, gt)inf\nt=0\nWe're looking for the best SPE for citizens. It is given by:\ninf\nX\nmax\nβt(u(gt) - h(yt))\n(yt,gt)inf\nt=0 t=0\nsubject to\nu(gt) ≥ h(yt)\n∀t\n(IC - C)\ninf\nX\nwt :=\nδs v(yt+s - gt+s) ≥ v(yt)\n∀t\n(IC - P )\ns=0\n(IC - C) tells that the citizens have incentives to work each period, and (IC - P ) tells that the politician\nhas incentives to stay rather than stealing everything and running away. Note that we can see why it may\nbe useful to distort output right away: a lower yt makes it less likely that the politician will steal everything,\nbecause there is less to steal. The appeal of backloading is also apparent: keeping wt high via future rents\nto politican relaxes (IC - P ) whereas giving high consumption to citizens today.\nRecursive Formulation\nThe problem above is well-formulated and all, but admittedly hardly tractable (infinitely many first-order\nconditions!). Instead, we'll work with the recursive formulation (you'll see why this is simpler):\nV (w) := max u(g) - h(y) + βV (w +)\ny,g,w+\nsubject to\nv(y - g) + δw+ = w\n(γ)\n(PK)\nv(y - g) + δw+ ≥ v(y)\n(ψ)\n(IC - P )\nThe basic story: assume that citizens have somehow promised a (lifetime discounted) utility w to the\npolitician. They are now optimizing within this period: they decide how much to produce (y) and how\nmuch rents to leave to the politician (g), as well as how much to promise for the next period (w+). V (w)\nis the \"value\" they obtain by making the optimal decision when they start the period with a promise w.\nThe tricky part is: they know they'll do another optimization with another promise w+ next period, so next\nperiod's \"value\" βV (w+) is also a part of their utility.1 The constraint (PK) ensures that the promise is\nkept, (IC - P ) once again ensures that the politician does not steal everything and run away.\nBut now you should see why this is a more preferred formulation: this is essentially a static problem (only\nthree first-order conditions!). You can also easily show that this is a nicely behaved optimization problem\n(in particular, V (.) is concave and decreasing).\nLet's just write the Lagrangian and take the three FOCs:\n(F OCy )\n-h0(y) + γh0(y - g) + ψ (v 0(y - g) - v 0(y)) = 0\n(1)\n(F OCg )\nu 0(g) - γv0(y - g) - ψv0(y - g) = 0\n(2)\n(F OCw+ )\nβV 0(w +) + γδ + ψδ = 0\n(3)\n1This is called the recursive formulation because we're plugging V (w+) into the calculation of V (w). If you're not familiar\nwith this approach, Stokey-Lucas-Prescott is the resource.\n\nOn top of the FOCs, a fourth equation we can derive is via the envelope theorem:\nV 0(w) = -γ\n(4)\nLet's play around with these conditions a bit. Combining (1) and (2) gives:\nu 0(g) - h0(y) = ψv0(y)\n(5)\n- As long as the incentive constraint binds (ψ > 0), we have: u0(g) - h0(y) > 0. That is: output is\ndistorted!\n- Keeping the politician disciplined introduces output distortions. Or, a better way to put it: citizens\nfind it optimal to work less in order to discipline the politician. Intuition: first order gain-second order\nloss argument.\nCombining (3) and (4) gives:\nβ V 0(w +) = V 0(w) - ψ\nδ\n(6)\nSome analysis now:\n1. You can show that we must have the politician's incentive constraint binding in t = 0, i.e. ψ > 0.\nIntuition: if this constraint is slack, you're promising too much to the politician. Just promise less and\nconsume more!\n2. Since ψ > 0, by (5), u0(g) - h0(y) > 0 and there are output distortions at t = 0.\nβ\n3. Once again, since ψ > 0 at t = 0, by (6), we have:\nV 0(w+) < V 0(w). Consider the case β = δ (i.e.\nδ\npolitician is patient). Then this condition becomes: V 0(w+) < V 0(w). Combine it with the concavity\nof V (.), and we have:\n+\nw > w\nThat is, each period, you promise more and more to the politician for the future! In other words, there\nis backloading. Moreover, w cannot grow unboundedly (this is due to concavity of v(.)). This implies\n∗\nthat we must have w increasing and converging to some value w .\n4. In the limit we have w = w+ = w ∗ . In the case β = δ, (6) implies that we must have ψ = 0 in the\nlimit. That is, distortions disappear in the long run.\n5. Finally, note that the above reasoning does not work with δ < β (i.e. politician is impatient). In that\ncase, w converges to some wˆ with\nβ V 0( ˆw) = V 0( ˆw) - ψ\nδ\nConsequently, ψ > 0 even in the limit, and distortions do not disappear.\nNice, huh?\nBesley (2006)\nShifting gears now. I'll present a (really simple) model of political agency - this is based on Besley's \"canonical\nmodel\" in Chapter 3 of his 2006 book Principled Agents? The Political Economy of Good Government. Ferraz\nand Finan (2011) takes this model to set up a theoretical framework around their findings.\nThe model will be in many respects similar to the career concerns model we covered in class - a two period\nmodel where citizens vote for the politician in the second round because they believe she is a better type.\nThe difference will be that: unlike a career concern model, the politician knows about her type. Technically,\nthis assumption turns this into a model of adverse selection.\n\nThe Model\nWe have two periods: t ∈{0, 1}. The discount factor is δ ∈ (0, 1].\nThe politician has a (persistent) type i ∈{c, nc}, where c is corrupt and nc is noncorrupt. Each politician's\ntype is drawn from an iid distribution with Pr{i = nc} = π ∈ (0, 1).\nIn each period t ∈{1, 2}, there is a state of the world st ∈{0, 1}, privately observed by the politician. The\nstate of the world is drawn from an iid distribution with Pr{st = 1} =\n.\nIn each period t ∈{1, 2}, the elected politician of type i observes the state st and picks a policy et(st, i) ∈\n{0, 1}. The citizens have a payoff of\n(\nV,\nif et = st\nut(st, et) =\n0.\nif et =6\nst\nA noncorrupt politician simply maximizes the citizen's payoff - the interesting one is the corrupt politician.\nA corrupt politician receives \"ego rents\" of W from being in the office. In addition, she receives a payoff of\n(\n0,\nif et = st\nc\nu (st, et) =\nt\nrt\nif et =6\nst\nwhere rt is the \"private benefit\" from setting the wrong policy. (Consider the case of a procurement deal\nwhich should be signed with the most efficient firm. Nevertheless, only the politician observes firm efficiency,\nand corrupt politicians get a bribe for choosing the inefficient firm.) Here, rt is iid drawn from a disrtibution\nG(r) with mean μ and support [0, R]. To make model interesting, assume R is sufficiently high:\nR > δ(W + μ)\nThis condition guarantees that the corrupt politician with highest rt prefers to take the rents immediately,\nrather than waiting for the next period.\nTiming:\n1. An incumbent politician is in the office. The incumbent's type is drawn, and she privately observes\nher type.\n2. s1 is drawn and observed by the politician.\n3. If the incumbent is corrupt, r1 is drawn and observed by the politician.\n4. The incumbent chooses e1, and citizens observe their payoffs.\n5. Citizens decide whether to keep the incumbent or elect a new politician. If they elect a new politician,\nher type is drawn randomly from the same distribution.\n6. In the second period, s2 is drawn and observed by the elected politician, (if she is corrupt) r2 is drawn\nand observed by the politician, and the elected politician chooses e2. Payoffs are realized.\nAnalysis\nWe will look for a Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium of this game. As usual, use backward induction.\nIn the second period, there is no control over the elected politician, so\ne2(s2, nc) = s2\ne2(s2, c) = 1 - s2\n\nFollowing this, the citizens maximize the probability that a noncorrupt politician is elected in the second\nperiod. Note that if they elect a new politician, the aforementioned probability is π.\nSuppose, in equilibrium, citizens keep the incumbent if and only if she provides them V in the next period (this\nis to be verified later). Now, consider the first period. A noncorrupt politician always chooses e1(s1, nc) = s1,\nbut corrupt politician faces a trade off. If e1(s1, c) = 1 - s1, she receives a payoff of r1 (and is kicked out of\nthe office). If e1(s1, c) = s1, she receives a payoff of 0 in period 1 but an expected payoff of E[r1]+W = μ+W\nin the second period. Consequently,\ne1(s1, nc) = s1 ⇔ r1 ≤ δ(μ + W )\nand the probability that a corrupt incumbent will set e1 = s1 is:\nλ := G(δ(μ + W ))\nNote that as long as R > δ(W + μ), λ ∈ (0, 1). The fact that λ > 0 (i.e. some of the corrupt politicians\nbehave in favor of the citizens' interests) is the disciplining effect. Check the comparative statics to make\nsure it makes sense to you!\nFinally, we have to verify that citizen behavior we assumed earlier is indeed optimal. With the above\nbehavior, if u1 = 0, the incumbent immediately reveals herself to be a corrupt type, so replacing her is\noptimal. When u1 = V ,\nπ\nPr{i = nc|V } =\n> π\nπ + (1 - π)λ\nSo keeping the politician is indeed optimal.\nOne intuitive prediction of this model is that: if the disciplining effect is strong enough, then rent extraction\nλ\nis higher in the second period than in the first period. That is, if\n≥ π,\n1-λ\n(1 - π)(1 - λ)E[r|r ≥ δ(μ + W )] ≥ ((1 - π)λ + (1 - π)(1 - λ)(1 - π)) E[r]\nFerraz and Finan (2011) utilize this prediction to motivate their empirics: a first-term mayor should be\ninvolved in less corruption due to the disciplining effect.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.770 Introduction to Political Economy\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.770-Fall 2017\nRecitation 5 Notes\nArda Gitmez\nOctober 13, 2017\nToday:\nA review of dynamic games, with:\n- A formal definition of Subgame Perfect Equilibrium,\n- A statement of single-deviation principle, and,\n- Markov Perfect Equilibrium.\nWhy? Next week we'll start covering models on policy determination (legislative bargaining, political com\npromise etc.) and those models are dynamic - they heavily rely on SPE and punishment strategies etc.\nUnderstanding them will be useful!\nAlso, the models in last lecture (divide-and-rule and politics of fear) use Markov Perfect Equilibrium, so it's\nhelpful to review those.\nConsequently, this recitation will be mostly about game theory, and less about political economy. Indeed,\nthis document is based on the lecture notes I typed up when I was TAing for 14.122 (Game Theory) last year.\nThere exists another document in titled \"A Review of Dynamic Games\" - which more or less covers the same\nstuff, but some in greater detail and some in less.1 Here, I'll try to be more hands-on and go over some basic\nconcepts via some illustrations. Some good in-depth resources are Fudenberg and Tirole's Game Theory and\nGibbons' Game Theory for Applied Economists.\nExtensive Form Games: Definition and Notation\nInformally, an extensive form game is a complete description of:\n1. The set of players.\n2. Who moves when, and what choices they have.\n3. Players' payoffs as a function of the choices that are made.\n4. What players know when they move.\nI provide a formal definition of a finite extensive form game with perfect information (i.e. observed actions)\nbelow, but a similar definition applies to infinite horizon games, or games with imperfect information, as well.\nDefinition 1. A finite extensive form game with perfect information consists of\n1The notation used here differs from the one in the other document - sorry.\n\n1. A finite set I of players,\n2. A finite set T of nodes that form a tree2 along with functions giving for each nonterminal node t /∈ Z:\n(a) i(t): the player who moves,\n(b) A(t): the set of possible actions,\n(c) n(t, a): the successor node resulting from each possible action.\n3. Payoff functions ui : Z → R, i.e. mapping from terminal nodes to the real numbers.\nThis is too notation heavy for our purposes, and you shouldn't worry about it too much. Most of the notation\nis there because it helps us define the strategy space.\nGiven an extensive form game, define\nHj := {t ∈ T such that i(t) = j}.\nThis is the set of nodes (or histories, you may read) where j is called to move.\nWrite\nAj := ∪s∈H(j)A(s)\nDefinition 2. A pure strategy for player j in an extensive form game with perfect information is a function\nsj : Hj → Aj such that sj (h) ∈ A(h) for all h ∈ Hj .\nNote: A strategy is a complete contingent plan specifying what a player will do in any situation (history)\nthat arises.\nSubgame Perfect Equilibrium\nWhat's a \"subgame\" anyway?\nDefinition 3. Let G = (I, T, Z, i, A, n, u) be an extensive form game. A subgame G0 = (I0, T 0, Z0, i0, A0, n , u0)\nconsists of\n1. I0 = I\n2. T 0 ⊂ T consists of a single nonterminal node and all of its successors.\n3. All functions (i0, A0, n0, h0, u0) are exactly as in G but restricted to the appropriate domain given by T 0 .\nWe're now ready to define what a SPE is.\n∗\n∗\nDefinition 4. A strategy profile s is a Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE) if the restriction of s to\nG0 is a Nash Equilibrium of G0 for every subgame G0 of G.\nI'll not have time to discuss why this is an appropriate solution concept here - you can refer to the in-depth\nresources I listed above if interested.\nInfinite Horizon Games\nOk, the above discussion was useful in terms of visualizing what a subgame is, but you should've realized that\nmost of the examples we covered in class are infinite horizon games. In such games, drawing the game tree\nand finding all the subgames is a cumbersome task. To make it more tractable, we'll place more structure\non the game, and focus on infinite horizon multistage games with observed actions.\n2The notion of forming a tree leaves out cyclicities among nodes, etc.\n\nDefinition 5. An infinite horizon multistage game with observed actions is an extensive form game\nwhere:\n- At stage t = 0, 1, 2, ... some subset of players simultaneously choose actions.\n- All players observe stage t actions before choosing stage t + 1 actions.\n- Players' payoffs are some function of the action sequence: ui(a , a , ...).\nIt is often the case that that player i's payoffs are some discounted sum, i.e. they are of the form:\nui(si, s-i) = ui0(si, s-i) + δui1(si, s-i) + δ2 ui2(si, s-i) + . . .\nwhere uit(si, s-i) is a payoff received at t when the strategies are followed.\nInterpretation of δ Two possible interpretations of the discount rate is:\n1. Interest rate: δ = 1+r\n2. Probabilistic end of the game: suppose game is finite, but that the end is not deterministic. Instead,\ngiven that stage t is reached, there is probability δ that stage t + 1 will be reached.\nNote that the structure we place on these games makes the definition of a subgame easier. A subgame in this\ncontext is simply: the game played after a stage, following some history. A history ht, on the other hand, is\njust the list of actions taken up until this point:\nht = (a , a , . . . , a t)\nHere are two canonical examples of the games in this form:\nExample 1. Repeated Game.\nLet G be a simultaneous move game with finite action spaces A1, A2, . . . , AI . The infinitely repeated game\nt\nt\nGinf is the game where in periods t = 0, 1, 2, . . . the players simultaneously choose actions (a1, . . . , a ) after\nI\nobserving all previous actions. We define payoffs in this game by:\ninf\nX\nt\nt\nui(si, s-i) =\nδt gi(a1, . . . , a I )\nt=0\nt\nt\nwhere (a1, . . . , a ) is the actions taken in period t when players follow strategies s1, . . . , sI .\nI\nExample 2. Bargaining Game.\nSuppose a prize worth of $ 1 is to be divided between two players. The following procedure is used:\n1. At t = 0, 2, 4, ... Player 1 proposes a division (x1, 1 - x1). Player 2 then says yes or no. If yes, the\ngame ends. Otherwise, continue.\n2. At t = 1, 3, 5, ... Player 2 proposes (1 - x2, x2). Player 1 says yes or no.\nAssume that if (y, 1 - y) agreed to at period t, payoffs are: δty and δt(1 - y).\nAnalysis of Infinite Horizon Games\nNow that we have a tractable structure, we can find all the subgames of an infinite horizon multistage game\nwith observed action and find the SPE. It turns out this still isn't very easy: There are infinitely many\nsubgames and uncountably many strategies that might do better.\n\nSoon, we'll discuss a theorem which substantially simplifies the analysis in most infinite horizon games. We\nfirst need a definition.\nDefinition 6. An infinite horizon game G is continuous at inf if\nlim sup |ui(s) - ui(s 0)| = 0 s.t. s(ht) = s 0(ht) ∀t ≤ T\nT →inf i,s,s0\nEssentially, this means that distant future events have a very small effect on payoff. This is satisfied in a\nstandard game with discounting and bounded payoffs. For instance, repeated games (with bounded stage\ngame payoff) and the bargaining game are continuous at inf. Virtually in all the models we cover in this\nclass, this condition is satisfied. It is violated by no discounting, or some payoff function or technology that\nallows potentially unbounded payoffs.\nNow, some notation.\nDefinition 7. Write ui(si, s-i|ht) for the payoff ui( si, s -i), where ( si, s -i) are played to reach some history\nht, and then (si, s-i) are followed at later stages.\nOne interpretation for ui(si, s-i|ht) is the payoff of player i from (si, s-i) conditional on ht being reached.\n∗\nNote the following observation, which follows from the definition of SPE: s is a SPE iff ui(s ∗|ht) ≥\n∗\nui(si, s |ht) for all i and for all ht that start a subgame.\n-i\nWe're now ready to present the theorem justifying the one-stage deviation principle.\nTheorem 1. Suppose G is an infinite horizon extensive form game with observed actions that is continuous\n∗\nat inf. A strategy profile s is a SPE if and only if\n∗\n@ht and sˆi differing from s only in play of i at ht with\ni\n∗\nui(ˆsi, s -i|ht) > ui(s ∗ |ht)\nNote the strength of this theorem: recall that we had argued that the main difficulty of infinite horizon\ngames is that there are uncountably many deviations to check. This theorem says that in many games, it\nsuffices to check deviations at single stages, rather than checking other complicated deviations. Thanks to\nthis theorem, the only types of deviations we need to check are the ones where player i says: \"Let me deviate\n∗\n∗\nfrom s only once right now, and then go back to playing according to si .\" Without this theorem, we would\ni\n∗\nalso need to check deviations like: \"Let me deviate from s only once seven periods from now on, and then\ni\ntwelve periods from now on, etc.\" That's a very onerous task!\nBelow is the proof - you don't need to know it by heart (presented here just for the sake of completeness), but\nyou should keep the basic intuition in mind: Keep other players' strategies fixed. If you can find a profitable\ndeviation, you should be able to find a one-stage deviation as well. This is more or less the same idea with\nprinciple of optimality from dynamic programming - the idea which gives way to the recursive formulation.\n∗\nProof. ( =⇒ ) direction is obvious: if there is some profitable deviation from s ∗, clearly, s cannot be a SPE.\n( ⇐= ) direction is more interesting. We need to show that not being able to find one-stage deviations is\n∗\n∗\nsufficient to ensure that s is a SPE. Assume that s satisfies the no-single deviation property. We need to\n∗\nshow that ui(s ∗|ht) ≥ ui(si, s |ht) for all i and for all ht that start a subgame.\n-i\nWe will show this by covering two cases: (1) the case where the s0 differs from s ∗ in a finite number of stages,\ni\ni\n(2) the case where s0 differs from s ∗ in an infinite number of stages.\ni\ni\n\nStep 1. Suppose s ∗ and s0 differ only in T stages. We'll prove the result by induction on T .\ni\ni\n∗\nBase Step. Assume s and s differ only in period t0 . Consider an information set ht .\ni\ni\n∗\n∗\n∗\n- If t < t then ui(si , s -i|ht) = ui(si, s -i|ht), since they only differ on things that happen before\nstage t.\n- If t0 ≥ t then\nX\n∗\n∗\n∗\nX\nui(si, s -i|ht)\n=\nPr{ht |ht , s i, s -i}ui(si, s -i|ht )\nht0\n∗\n∗\n∗\nX\n=\nPr{ht |ht , s i , s -i}ui(si, s -i|ht )\nht0\n∗\n∗\n∗\n∗\n≤\nPr{ht |ht , s i , s -i}ui(si , s -i|ht )\nht0\n∗\n∗\n= ui(si , s -i|ht).\nWhere the first equality follows by definition, the second equality follows because s0 and s ∗ are\ni\ni\nthe same in periods before t0 (which implies that they give the same probability of reaching to a\n∗\nhistory ht0 ), and the inequality follows due to the running hypothesis that s satisfies the no-single\ndeviation property.\nInductive Step. Assume the result holds for strategies that differ in T periods. Let s0 be any strategy\ni\n∗\ndiffering from s in T + 1 periods. Let t0 denote the last period at which they differ, and define si by:\ni\n(\n0s (ht) if t < t0\ni\ns i(ht) =\n∗\ns (ht) if t ≥ t0\ni\nFor any ht, we have:\n∗\n∗\n∗\n∗\nui(si, s -i|ht) ≤ ui( si, s -i|ht) ≤ ui(si , s -i|ht)\nwhere the first inequality comes from an argument identical to the one made in T = 1 case and the\nsecond inequality follows from inductive hypothesis.\nThe induction is therefore complete, and so is the proof for Step 1.\nStep 2. Suppose s0 differs from s ∗ in an infinite number of periods. Suppose, to get a contradiction, that\ni\ni\nthere exists an information set ht (which is an initial node of a subgame) such that\nui(s 0\n∗\ni, s -i|ht) > ui(s ∗ |ht)\nClearly, we can find an ε > 0 such that\n∗\nui(si, s -i|ht) > ui(s ∗ |ht) + ε\n(1)\nSince G is continuous at inf, we can find a T such that |ui(s0) - ui(s00)| < ε whenever s and s\ndiffer\nonly after first T periods. Let si be the strategy with\n(\n0s (ht) if t < T\ni\ns i(ht) =\n∗\nsi (ht) if t ≥ T\nThen we have:\n∗\nui( si, σ ∗\ni, s -i|ht) - ε > ui(s\n-i|ht) > ui(s\n∗ |ht)\n\nwhere the first inequality follows because si and s0 differ only after the first T periods, and the second\ni\ninequality follows by Equation (1). But this contradicts the conclusion of Step 1, because si differs\n∗\nfrom s in a finite number of periods.\ni\nSince we have covered both steps, which consider exhaustive cases, the result follows.\nExample: Bargaining Game\nTo illustrate the use of one-stage deviation principle and to show the power of SPE in one interesting model,\nwe now return to the bargaining model discussed earlier. We will show that SPE provides quite sharp pre\ndictions for this game.\nClaim 1. In Bargaining Game, a SPE is:\n∗\nsi (ht) =\nat all proposal nodes\n1 + δ\n(\nδ\nyes if offered at least\n∗\n1+δ\nsi (ht) =\nat all response nodes\nδ\nno\nif offered less than 1+δ\nProof. Remember that Bargaining Game is continuous at inf. Therefore, using Theorem 1, we just need to\nshow\n∗\n∗\n∗\nui(si , s -i|ht) ≥ ui(si, s -i|ht)\nwhenever s differs only at ht .\ni\n- Case 1: ht is a proposal node, so\nδt\n∗\n∗\nui(si , s -i|ht) =\n.\n1 + δ\nIf si differs at ht then\n(\nδt+1 δ\nif si(ht) >\n∗\n1+δ\n1+δ\nui(si, s -i|ht) =\n.\nδt × less if si(ht) is less than 1+δ\n- Case 2: ht is a response node where y was offered.\nδ\n∗\nIf response is yes, then δty is the payoff. If response is no then δt+1\n1+δ . If y ≥\nthen si (ht) = yes\n1+δ\nδ\n∗\nis optimal. If y <\nthen s (ht) = no is optimal.\n1+δ\ni\nThe result follows.\nThis proposition is useful and illustrates the strength of Theorem 1, but what about other SPE? Below,\nwe show that the SPE we characterized above is unique. It also illustrates another interesting technique:\na non-constructive proof of uniqueness by conducting the analysis in the payoff space instead of strategy\nspace. We'll cover this in next Monday's class, but it never hurts to cover it earlier, right?\nClaim 2. In the Barganing Game, in any SPE, Player 1 receives a payoff of\nand Player 2 receives a\n1+δ\nδ\npayoff of 1+δ\nProof. Suppose v and v are the smallest and largest possible payoffs for a Player 1 (the first proposer) in a\nSPE. Some observations:\n1. 0 ≤ v ≤ v ≤ 1. By construction.\n2. 1-v ≥ δv. This is because Player 2 can always reject the offer and propose in the next round, in which\nshe gets at least δv. This implies that Player 1 must leave at least δv to Player 2 when she proposes.\n\n3. v ≥ 1 - δv . This is because if the game advances to the next round, Player 2 will at most get δv . Thus,\nany offer giving Player 2 δv + ε must be accepted. Therefore, Player 1 can ensure a payoff of at least\n1 - δv - ε for any ε.\nIf you draw the set of all points that satisfy all three inequalities, you'll see that v = v = 1+δ .\nThis concludes the proof that the proposing player must get\nin every subgame in a SPE. Incidentally,\n1+δ\nthis is also the payoff that Player 1 receives in the SPE we constructed earlier.\nNote that the extremely strong predictive power of SPE in Bargaining Game depends on a few critical\nassumptions. If, for instance, there was simultaneous proposals by both players, then any division (x, 1 - x)\nis a SPE. The predictions also would not extend to the case of more than two players: in such a case, the\npredictive power of SPE drops significantly.\nMarkov Perfect Equilibrium\nThe Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) concept is a drastic refinement of SPE developed as a reaction to\nthe multiplicity of equilibria in dynamic problems. (SPE doesn't suffer from this problem in the context\nof a bargaining game, but many other games -especially repeated games- contain a large number of SPE.)\nEssentially it reflects a desire to have some ability to pick out unique solutions in dynamic problems.\nPayoff-Relevant Variables\nAfter seeing examples where SPE lacks predictive power, people sometimes start to complain about un\nreasonable \"bootstrapping\" of expectations. Suppose we want to rule out such things. One first step to\ndeveloping such a concept is to think about the minimal set of things we must allow people to condition on.\nOften, there is a natural set of payoff-relevant variables.\nExample 3. Exploitation of Common Resource.\n- Two fishermen choose quantities (q10, q20), (q11, q21), ..., (q1t, q2t).\n- Stock of fish grows by St+1 = (1 + g)(St - (q1t + q2t))\n- Price is pt = P (q1t + q2t)\n\nWith unrestricted strategy spaces, anything could happen with patient agents. This is because either fisher\nman can fish to extinction in the next period, and construct an equilibrium using it as a threat point.\nOn the other hand, Markov approach allow qit to depends only on St, and not on how we got there.\nClearly we would like a solution concept that eliminates such punishments, and have a solution more like a\n\"repeated static NE\".\nDefinition, Notation and Examples\nLet G be a multistage game with observed actions, i.e. at time t = 0, 1, 2, . . . some subset of players simul\ntaneously choose actions and all previous actions are observed before these choices are made.\nDefinition 8. Period t histories ht and (h0)t0 are said to be Markov equivalent, ht ∼ (h0)t0 , if for any\ntwo action sequences {αs}inf\nand {βs}inf\nof present and future action profiles and for all i:\ns=0\ns=0\ngi(ht , {αs}) ≥ gi(ht , {βs}) ⇐⇒ gi((h0)t0 , {αs}) ≥ gi((h0)t0 , {βs}).\nIntuitively, two histories are Markov equivalent when the relative preferences over future actions are identi\ncal. Note that we allow payoffs to be scaled differently but want decision making to be the same.\nSome examples:\n- In the common resource game, any two histories ht , (h0)t0 with the same number of fish (St = St\n0 ) are\nMarkov equivalent.\n- In a repeated game, any two histories are Markov Equivalent.\n- In the divide-and-rule model, any two histories which end up with the same state (K or D) are Markov\nequivalent. Indeed, in almost all of the dynamic game models we covered in class, the definition of\nwhat a state is will be obvious.\nLet H = ∪tHt and Ai = ∪tAit. Recall that a strategy is a function si : H → Ai.\nDefinition 9. A Markov strategy is a function\nsi : H → Ai\nsuch that\nsi(ht) = si((h0)t0 )\nwhenever ht ∼ (h0)t0 .\nDefinition 10. A Markov Perfect Equilibrium of G is a SPE of G in which all players use Markov\nstrategies.\nNote that an effect of this refinement is: it declares past to be irrelevant as long as present value of payoff-\nrelevant variables to be the same. This essentially eliminates the effect of punishments.\nHere's an existence result:\nProposition 1. A MPE exists in any finite multistage game with observed actions, and in infinite horizon\ngames whose payoffs are continuous at inf.\nAnd here's another result which (in a loose sense) suggests that Markov strategies are self-enforcing:\n\nProposition 2. If all other players use Markov strategies, then the remaining player has a Markov strategy\namong her (unrestricted) best responses.\nThis result holds because when the other players are not conditioning on irrelevant things (past play), then\nyou do not have to condition on irrelevant things either.\nDoes MPE fix the problems we started with?\n- In some cases, yes. For instance, for a repeated game, Markov Perfect Equilibria are NE for the static\ngame, repeated each period.\n- Similarly, in the divide-and-rule model there are many SPE (where the ruler can condition punishments\non the past behavior) but a unique MPE.\n- In other cases, it may be tricky. For instance, in the common resources game, if the stock of fish grows\nin a deterministic manner, then one can still do punishments (e.g. \"if number of fish is not exactly 137\nwe'll catch everything tomorrow.\") Putting some noise in the stock of fish sometimes fixes this, but\nthere is no general rule which asserts that it always will.\nIn a (totally unrelated) note:\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.770 Introduction to Political Economy\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Indirectly, this is a discussion\non the difference between political economy and game theory.\nPicking from where we left off last week... Recall that our focus was on infinite horizon multistage games\nwith observed actions.\nDefinition 1. An infinite horizon multistage game with observed actions is an extensive form game\nwhere:\n- Set of players I is finite.\n- At stage t = 0, 1, 2, ... player i ∈I chooses ait ∈ Ait.\n- All players observe stage t actions at = (a1t, . . . , a|I|t) before choosing stage t + 1 actions.\n- Players' payoffs are some function of the action sequence: ui(a0, a1, ...).

(Makes it a game\nwith infinitely many players, but results still go through.)\n- In this game, we can construct SPE's where any consumption stream is possible. This is because any\nplayer can punish a deviation by consuming everything.\nClearly we would like a solution concept that eliminates such punishments, and have a solution more like a\n\"repeated static NE\".\nDefinition, Notation and Examples\nLet G be a multistage game with observed actions, i.e. at time t = 0, 1, 2, . . . some subset of players simul\ntaneously choose actions and all previous actions are observed before these choices are made.\nDefinition 2.

In the log\nutility, each self t chooses an αt ∈ [0, 1], which is the fraction of wealth to consume. The only Markov\nPerfect Equilibrium in this game is α∗, which solves:\ninf\nX\nα ∗ = arg max log(αAt) + β\nδs log(α ∗ At+s)\nα\ns=1\nwhere the law of motion is given by:\nAt+s = (1 - α)At(1 + r)s(1 - α ∗ )s-1\n\nsubstituting, rearranging and dropping constant terms, we have:\ninf\nX\nα ∗ = arg max log(α) + β\nδs log(1 - α)\nα\ns=1\nwhich implies:\n1 - δ\nα ∗ = 1 - δ + βδ\nDynamic Games\nA good resource on dynamic games is the supplementary material by Daron I posted last week. You should\nreally go check it, but let me briefly emphasize the concept of a dynamic game. From that document:\nThe difference between dynamic games and infinitely repeated games is that in dynamic games,\nthere is an underlying state, which evolves over time as a result of the actions by players and by\nnature.\nSo, long story short, a dynamic game makes our lives easier by explicitly giving us the state. Otherwise,\nwe'd need to come up with the definition of a state and it's not always obvious. (There is a long discussion\nhere on the possibility of defining the set of all histories as the set of states - this would allow us to make\neverything Markovian in an uninteresting way. I don't want to go into this discussion, partly because it's\nconfusing and partly because it's not necessary for this class. For this class, if there's a state given, you\nshould use it!)\nSo a dynamic game has a set of states K, a set of actions Ai(k) for each k ∈ K, and a (per-period) utility\nfunction:\nui : A × K → R\nalong with a Markovian transition function:\nq(kt+1|at, kt)\nA history in this context will be the list of actions and states so far:\nht = (a0, k0, a1, k1, . . . , at, kt)\nJust for the sake of comparison with the definition made at the beginning, a dynamic game is a game where:\n- Set of players I is finite.\n- At stage t = 0, 1, 2, ... player, if state is k ∈ K, i ∈I chooses ait ∈ Ai(k).\n- All players observe stage t actions at = (a1t, . . . , a|I|t) before choosing stage t + 1 actions.\n- Players' payoffs are\ninf\nX\nui = E[\nδt ui(at, kt)]\nt=0\nThis definition is very similar to the definition of a multistage game, but there is more of a sense of stationarity\nhere. (Everything that's time dependent is now taken care of via the states!)\nA (pure) strategy for player i in a dynamic game is:\nsi : H × K → Ai\nWhereas a (pure) Markov strategy is:\nsi : K → Ai\nNow, with some contemplation, you should be able to realize that the Markov strategy I define here is really\nMarkov in the sense of Definition 2. (This is because of the stationary nature of the game!)\n\nDynamic Games vs Repeated Games\nExistential question time: Why are we doing all these?\nThe analysis of games with discounting has been a focus of game theoretic analysis for years. They have\ntons of results (folk theorems, reputation results etc.) What are we learning new from all of these analysis?\nI'd go on to argue that the broad implications are vastly different. A standard game theoretical model\nargues that in short term relationships (one-shot and finite horizon games) have a difficult time sustaining\ncooperation among players. A standard folk theorem result basically says that \"In an infinite horizon game,\nwith sufficiently patient players (i.e. with more frequent interactions of a longer expected life) we can sustain\ncooperation.\" This is a pretty robust insight which all of these game theoretical analysis builds upon. In a\ndynamic game, this insight can be overturned.\nAs an example, consider the \"Constitutional Choice Game\" example - a favorite example of Daron. There\nare three states: absolutism a, constitutional monarchy c, and full democracy d. There are two agents: elite\nE and middle class M . The per period payoffs are:\nuE (d) < uE (a) < uE (c)\nuM (a) < uM (c) < uM (d)\nAssume that E rules in a (i.e. they decide on which state to move to) and M rules in c and d. Suppose the\ninitial state is a.\nIt is clear that a move from a to c is a Pareto improvement: both groups are better off. Consequently, a\nis not Pareto efficient whereas c and d are. Do we obtain a Pareto improvement in equilibrium, are are we\nstuch with a? (Read: when do the elites extend the francise?)\nThe answer is: whenever elites are not patient, we end up in a Pareto efficient state. In particular, staying\nin a yields a payoff of\n1 uE (a)\n1 - β\nto the elites. When they move to c, they realize that the next period M will move to d and they'll stay there\nforever. The payoff is:\nβ\nuE (c) +\nuE (d)\n1 - β\nClearly, a move to c (and eventually d) occurs when\nβ\nuE (a) - βuE (d)\nuE (c) +\nuE (d) ≥\nuE (a) ⇔ uE (c) ≥\n1 - β\n1 - β\n1 - β\nwhich is true for sufficiently low β!\nThis is a simple and interesting \"flip\" on our intuition about the cooperation (i.e. obtaining the Pareto\nefficient outcome) in general. Indeed, Daron builds his 14.773 lectures based on this intuition - so if you\nwant to see more, take 14.773!\nAlso, Daron has a paper titled \"Why not a Political Coase Theorem?\" (2013) investiagting this issue in\ndepth - you can check it if interested.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.770 Introduction to Political Economy\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
