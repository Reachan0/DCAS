      "content": "BE.450 final exam\nName\n1. An association between Helicobacter hepaticus infection and hepatocellular\ntumors in susceptible strains of laboratory mice has been proven. What\nevidence would be needed to establish a link between enterohepatic\nHelicobacter species (i.e. non-gastric Helicobacter species) infection and liver\ncancer in humans? Describe the kinds of studies and findings that you think\nwould lead the International Agency for Research on Cancer to include infection\nwith enterohepatic Helicobacter species along with infection with Helicobacter\npylori, schistosomes, and liver flukes as being carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).\n\nBE.450 final exam\nName\n2. In an editorial accompanying the paper by Kirk Mauer et al. titled \"Identification\nof cholelithogenic enterohepatic Helicobacter species and their role in murine\ncholesterol gallstone formation\" (Gastroenterology 2005), Alan Hofmann wrote:\nMauer et al. show convincingly that infection with a single strain of Helicobacter (H\nbilis) or 2 strains (H hepaticus and H rodentium) of enterohepatic Helicobacter\naccelerates the formation of cholesterol gallstones in mice fed a lithogenic diet. The\narticle sheds little light on the mechanism of this effect. No data are provided on biliary\nlipid composition or on the activities of the transporters encoded by the Lith genes.\nPathologic changes in the intestine, liver, and biliary tract are described sketchily.\nAlthough Helicobacter DNA was not present in bile at the time of sampling (16 weeks),\nthe gallbladder mucosa was inflamed, with \"hyalinosis, intestinal metaplasia, eosinophilic\ninflammation, hyperplasia, and dysplastic change\" being observed. Presumably, future\narticles from these laboratories will provide detailed information on these key features of\nthe disease model.\nDescribe one experiment that you think would help establish the mechanism by\nwhich enterohepatic Helicobacter infection contributes to cholesterol gallstone\ndisease in mice fed a lithogenic diet. Be sure to state the hypothesis your\nexperiment will test.\n\nBE.450 final exam\nName\n3. It has been suggested that hepatocellular tumors in rodents treated with\nchemical carcinogens develop from foci of altered hepatocytes. These foci have\naltered phenotypes based on their histochemical appearance (i.e. increased γ-\nglutamyl transferase [γ-GT] expression). However, the functional changes in\nthese foci that confer malignant potential are not understood. What do you think\nare the main advantages and limitations of using (A) genomic and (B) proteomic\nanalysis to characterize these altered foci? What are your main technical and\nconceptual concerns (i.e. potential problems) about using these approaches to\nascertain the role of altered foci in hepatic carcinogenesis?\n\nBE.450 final exam\nName\n4. What do you think is the best currently available animal model for human viral\nhepatitis leading to hepatocellular carcinoma? You should define what you mean\nby best, and can limit your comparison to hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or\nboth. Be sure to explain your reasoning.\n\nBE.450 final exam\nName\n5. It has been argued that the only real value of randomized, controlled\nchemoprevention studies is that they can demonstrate sufficient weight of\nevidence to justify committing immense resources to primary prevention efforts.\nDo you think that intervention with micronutrients or pharmaceutical agents to\nprevent hepatocellular carcinoma in parts of the world with high rates of aflatoxin\nexposure and hepatitis virus infection is worthwhile, or do you think that\nprevention should focus exclusively on eliminating food contaminants and\nvaccination? Explain your reasoning."

The paper titled \"Dendritic cells loaded with stressed tumor cells elicit long-\nlasting protective tumor immunity in mice depleted of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T\ncells\" by Prasad et al. reports that stressed and gamma-irradiated syngeneic\ntumor cells elicit protective CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the absence of\ndendritic cell (DC) maturation. In the absence of infectious non-self (i.e. pattern\nrecognition receptor [PRR] agonists) do you think necrotic cells or apoptotic cells\nwould be more effective at inducing DC activation? Explain your reasoning.\n\n2.

(You may use an\nexplanation and/or an illustration to answer the last part of this question).\n\n4. \"Cross-priming\" refers to the activation of naive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL;\nCD8+ T cells) by antigen-presenting cells (APC) that have acquired nominal\nantigens from another cell. Although injection of mice with MHC-mismatched\ncells expressing minor H antigens has been shown to prime self-MHC-restricted\nCTL responses specific for the minor H antigens, the biological relevance of\ncross-priming in protective immunity against viral infection remains controversial.\nDescribe one experiment that could be performed to test that hypothesis that\nvirus-specific CTL are elicited by cross-priming. Be sure to state why the\nexperimental result supports (or refutes) the hypothesis, and how you control for\ndirect priming.\n\n5. Answer the following question posted on a hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing and\nprevention web forum.\nI donated blood and the results came back positive for anti-nucleocapsid core protein\n(anti-HBc) only. Although the blood was trashed, I thought this might have been a false\npositive result. I donated blood a second time and got no notification that there were any\nproblems with my blood, and I was asked to donate again in the future - which I did.\nNow the third time I donated, I was again anti-HBc positive only. Now I am told that I\nshould never again in my entire life donate blood. First of all, why would my future\ndonations be denied if I am not a carrier (I wasn't positive for anything else)? It seems to\nme that HBV isn't a death sentence for most people - greater than 90% clear the\ninfection. Aren't the odds of transmitting HBV from a person who has cleared the\ninfection via blood transfusion very low? Since we are desperate for donors, is this really\na necessary precaution?"

animal\n\nToxin Terminology\n- Exotoxin = protein toxins of bacteria, in\ncontrast to endotoxin (LPS)\n- Not all exotoxins are secreted; some\naccumulate inside the bacterium and are\nreleased by bacterial lysis\n- Cytotoxin = target a wide range of cell\ntypes, in contrast to neurotoxins,\nleukotoxins, hepatotoxins, cardiotoxins\n\nMore Toxin Terminology\n- Toxins can be named for the bacterial\nspecies that produce them, such as cholera\ntoxin, Shiga toxin, diphtheria toxin and\ntetanus toxin\n- Toxins can be named for their activities,\nsuch as adenylate cyclase, lecithinase\n- Toxins can be simply given letter\ndesignations, such as exotoxin A\n\nToxin Classification by Mechanism\n- Type I toxins bind to the host cell surface,\nbut they are not translocated into the host\ncell (i.e. superantigens [Sag])\n- Type II toxins disrupt eukaryotic cell\nmembranes (i.e. phospholipases, and pore-\nforming toxins)\n- Type III toxins are A-B toxins, which have\na binding (B) component and active (A)\ncomponent\n\nSuperantigens (Type I) Toxins\n- Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) (toxic shock\nsyndrome)\n- Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (Spe) (toxic\nshock-like syndrome and scarlet fever)\n- Staphylococcal enterotoxin (food poisoning)\nHormone Analog\n- STa (heat-stable toxin) (diarrhea)\n\nSuperantigens (Type I Toxins)\nAPC\nAPC\nHelper T cell\nHelper T cell\nFew clones\nFew clones\nPeptide\nPeptide\nMany clones\nMany clones\nSAg\nSAg\n\nMembrane-Disrupting (Type II)\nToxins\n- Alpha-toxin (gas gangrene)\n- Alpha-toxin (necrosis)\n- Listeriolysin O (LLO) (listeriosis)\n- Pneumolysin (pneumonia)\n- Streptolysin O (SLO) (rheumatic fever)\n- Hemolysin A (Hly A) (urinary tract\ninfections and peritonitis)\n\nMembrane-Disrupting (Type II)\nToxins\n- Two types of membrane-disrupting toxins\n- Pore-forming toxins insert holes in the\nmembrane\n- Enzymes cleave bonds in membrane phopholipids\n- Erythrocytes provide a convenient method\nto assay activity, so these toxins are often\ncalled hemolysins\n\nRole of Membrane Disrupting\nToxins\n- In some cases, the primary role appears to\nbe killing of professional phagocytes, such\nas neutrophils and macrophages\n- In other cases, they are used by invasive\nbacteria to escape from a phagosome and\nenter the host cell cytoplasm\n\nA-B (Type III) Toxins\n- Diphtheria toxin (diphtheria)\n- Cholera toxin (cholera)\n- LT (heat-labile toxin) (infant diarrhea and\ntraveler's diarrhea)\n- Shiga toxin (dysentery and hemolytic\nuremic syndrome [HUS])\n- Botulinum toxin (botulism)\n- Tetanus toxin (tetanus)\n- Pertussis toxin (whooping cough)\n\nA-B (Type III) Toxins\n- First toxins studied\n- Historically more interest in A-B toxins than\nType I or type II\n- Simple A-B toxins are synthesized as a\nsingle polypeptide\n- Often A and B portions are separated during\nprocessing by proteolytic cleavage\n- Compound A-B toxins are composed of\nmultiple B monomers\n\nS\nS\nSimple A-B toxin\nSimple A-B toxin\nB portion\nB portion\nA portion\nA portion\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nCompound A-B toxin\nCompound A-B toxin\nA portion\nA

B\nsubunit is the carbohydrate moiety of a\nglycoconjugate\n- Distribution of receptor determines target\ncell specificity\n- In some cases, the A subunit needs to be\nenzymatically activated within the\ncytoplasm, by host cell proteins\n\nMechanisms of Action of A-B\nToxins\n- Although A-B toxins target many different\ncell types, many of them catalyze the same\nreaction\n- ADP-ribosylation, the transfer of ADP-\nribose from NAD to a target protein,\nchanges the behavior of the target protein\n- Diphtheria toxin inactivates elongation factor-2\n- Cholera toxin constitutively activates a Gs GTP-\nbinding protein that regulates adenylate cyclase\n\nNIAID Category A & B Priority\n(Bacterial) Pathogens\nCategory A\n- Bacillus anthracis\n- Clostridium botulinum\n- Yersinia pestis\n-
