It is a member of the\nChamic sub-branch of the vast Austronesian family that includes Malay, Philippine, and\nPolynesian languages.

      "content": "24.961\nTone-1: African Languages\n1. Main theme\n- the study of tone in African lgs. raised serious conceptual problems for the\nrepresentation of the phoneme as a bundle of distinctive features.\n- the solution to the problem (autosegmental representations) became a model for\nall other features\n- tone exhibits the widest range of phonological behavior, perhaps reflecting fact\nthat F0 is separated from rest of signal at an early point in auditory processing\n2. Phonetic correlates of tone\n- F0; stiffen and slacken vocal folds\n- typically realized on modal voicing\n- domain: often larger than single segment (syllable, word)\n- Tone-Bearing Unit: typically syllable, mora also possible (Lithuanian, Makua,\nJapanese); often spills over syllable boundary (peak delay)\n- often accompanied by voice quality features like creaky and breathy voice\n- can be affected by laryngeal features of adjacent consonants (tonogenesis)\n3. notation\n- Two-way contrast: a vs. a (or a) most Bantu languages\n- Three-way contrast: a vs. a (or a) vs. a (Yoruba, Buli syuk H 'path', syuk M\n'navel', syuk 'fish sp.'\n- Contours: a (rise) a (fall)\n- Features for H, M, L\n- Goldsmith: [+highpitch, -lowpitch], [-highpitch, -lowpitch], [-highpitch,\n+lowpitch] (3-way height contrast; cf. vowel height)\n- Yip: [+upper, -high], [-upper, +high], [-upper, -high] ([+upper, +high] for raised\nH) (4-way height contrast)\n4. descriptive problems with tone motivating a novel conception of feature organization\n- decomposition of contour tones Rise into LH and Fall into HL\n- tonal melodies and tonal polarity\n5. Margi (Chadic, Nigeria): H, L, R (Williams 1973, Hoffmann 1963)\n- rising tone behaves phonologically as combination of Low plus High\n- derivational source from syllable coalescence\nsal\nsal-ari\n'man'\nkum\nkum-ari\n'meat'\ntagu\ntagw-ari\n'horse'\nu?u\nu?w-ari\n'fire'\n- tonal melody in verbs\n\nsa\nndabya\nH\nHH\ngha\ndza?u\nL\nLL\nhu\ngusu\nR\nLH\nin a language with tonal melodies, the number of tonal contrasts does not increase\nwith the length of the lexical item; rather the melody is extended to encompass\nadditional syllables\n- tonal polarity: affix takes the opposite tone from the root: [tense-root-subject]\na sa gu\n'you go astray'\na wi gu\n'you run'\na vl gu\n'you fly'\n5. adding features of [±rise], [±fall] does not express the equivalence with LH and HL\n6. Goldsmith (1976) Autosegmental Phonology\n- tonal features are represented on a separate level (tier) from segmental features\n- the temporal relation between the tonal tier and the segmental tier is represented\nby association lines\n- rules of tonal phonology define and modify the associations as well as changing\nthe feature coefficients\n7. Margi analyzed autosegmentally\ndevocalization\nu ? u - a r i\nu ? w - a r i\n-> u ? w - a r i\nsegmental tier\n| | | |\n| | | | / | |\nH L H L\nH L H L H LH L\ntonal tier\n- tonal stability: while vowel deletes or devocalizes to a glide and hence loses its\nability to hold a tone, the tone does not disappear but is reassociated with an\nadjacent syllable\n8. Goldsmith's (1976) Well-Formedness Condition on autosegmental representations\n(rules apply to maximally satisfy it; early example of rules driven to satisfy a constraint)\n- every tone is associated with a tone-bearing unit (TBU = syllable, mora)\n- every tone-bearing unit is associated with a tone\n- association lines do not cross (for locality)\n9. Margi tonal melodies\n- verb roots belong to one of three tonal classes: H, L, LH\n\n- tones are associated with tone-bearing units (syllable) one-to- one, left-to-right\n- tones spread to satisfy the first condition of the WFC\n- tones associate to satisfy the second\n- implication that asymmetric location of plateux and contours should correlate\n- subsequent research fails to support this prediction\n- Zhang (UCLA diss) and others: contours prefer right edge of word; reflex of\nphonetic duration in citation, phrase-final position\n8. Leben (1978): further work by Dweyer finds that LHH melody of Hausa ndavula 'sling'\nis counter-exemplified by more numerous LLH of lasimo 'amulet'. Leben suggests that H\nis mapped to right edge for majority class while left-to-right is default\nsimilar asymmetry for Kukuya (Paulian 1974)\nka 'to pick'\nkara 'paralytic'\nkaraga 'be entangled'\nsa 'knot'\nsami 'conversation'\nmwai 'younger brother'\n9.

But other\naspects of phonological competence seem better suited to constraint formalism.\n\n[2] limitations on s ound i nventory a nd s hape:\n\no\nFijian p, t, k vs. English p, t, k, b, d, g.\no\nhow do\n\nwe deal with the absence of something?\no\ndoes it make any sense to say that Fijian could have [b] but does not? Actively reject it?\no\nThis implies that speaker knows about [b]. More generally that typologically the absence of some\nproperty is as important as its presence (cf. Principles & Parameters).\no\nOne answer to this question was to follow the structuralists (Trubetzkoy, Bloomfieldians): In English\n[-voice] and [+voice] contrast and so are unpredictable and hence listed in the lexicon\no\nbut [-voice] in Fijian is redundant; if the lexicon is the repository of unpredictable information, we can\nrepresent Fijian /p/ as [ 0voice] and posit a rewrite rule:\n[-sonorant] -> [-voice]\no\nNow English and Fijian are formally different; we use rewrite rules.\n[3]. Problems with t his approach: it doesn't lend i tself well to o ther cases\no\nFijian is CV. No CCV, again different from English.\no\nDo we say every consonant is followed by a vowel ( [0cons] -> [-cons] / [+cons] ___) or every vowel\nis preceded by a consonant ([0cons] -> [+cons] / ___ [-cons]? Directionality problems.\no\nIn many cases ru\n\nles m\nust refer to the redundant information: e.g. stress f alls o n vowels n ot on\nconsonants so we must fill in the [0consonantal] for the stress rule to work properly.\no\nProposed solution: Morpheme-Structure Rules: state generalizations over the lexicon on the shape of\nwords and morphemes before lexical insertion and hence entry into the phonological component.\no\nBut then a \"duplication problem\" (Kenstowicz & K\nisseberth 1976) arises where the same constraint\nexpressing passive limitations on morpheme form (Morpheme-Structure Rules) also plays an active\nrole in shaping the output of ru\n\nles g overning alternations.\n[4]. Japanese obstruent voicing (data and analysis from Ito & Mester 1986, 2003)\n\no\nContrast of [voice]: asa 'morning' vs. aza 'bruise'; aka 'red', aga 'fried tofu'\no\nIn Yamato (native) and mimetic vocabulary no voice contrast after nasals:\ntombo 'dragonfly', kande 'chewing', unzari 'disgusted', kangae 'thought';\no\nMSR: [-sonorant] -> [+voice] / [+nasal] ___\no\ncontrols output of concatenation:\ntabe-ru\ntabe-te\n'eat'\n\nsin-u\n\nsin-de\n\n'die'\n\nyom-u\nyon-de\n'read'\no\nIf p ostnasal voicing in its M\n\nSR function applies solely in the lexicon before morpheme combination,\nthen we seem to say the same thing twice: obstruents voice after a nasal in the lexicon and again in the\nphonological component; how can the same rule be in two different places?\no\nAlternatively, the rule can be taken out of l exicon and placed in the phonological component; but then\nit has a \"double function\" (fills in z eros for tombo and changes contrastive values for -t ≈ -d).\no\nBut now we no longer directly state a generalization that is true of morpheme shapes in the lexicon.\nWhat is to prevent a voiceless consonant in this position?\no\nYamato Japanese lacks such lexical items--how i s this generalization to be expressed?\n\n[5]. Lyman's Law: only o ne voiced o bstruent per morpheme1\n\no\n(Yamato, Sino-Japanese vocabulary)\nkak-u\n\nkusa\n\nsato\n'write'\n'grass'\n'village'\nkago\n\nkaze\n\nkado\n'basket'\n'wind'\n'corner'\ngake\n\ndas-u\n\nbuta\n'cliff'\n\n'take out'\n'pig'\n*gVg\n\n*dVz\n\n*bVd\no\nThere is no effective way to express this as a rule filling in zeros. We need a negative constraint on\nmorpheme shape:\n* [+voice] ..... [+voice]\n[6]. What about the redundant [0voice] after a nasal?\no\nDoes it allow a violation of Lyman's Law?\no\nApparently not: *dombo.\no\nThus it appears that a redundant [+voice] functions the same as a contrastive one for this\ngeneralization. Hence we need\ntombo\n* dombo\n|\n\n| |\n[+voi] [+voi] [+voi]\no\nWe also require a negative statement of the constraint: *[+nasal] [-voice]\no\nNow the post-nasal voicing sound change in /yom-te/ -> yonde appears to be a way to \"satisfy\" the\nconstraint.\no\nBut now we are even further from the goal of a unified statement since we have a constraint *[nasal] [-\nvoice] and a rule that changes [-voice] to [+voice] after a nasal to evidently satisfy the constraint. But it\ngets worse.\n\n[7]. Rendaku (\"s\n\nequential\") voicing:\no\nfirst consonant of second e lement of a compound is voiced (cf. linking morphemes in the compounds\nof German (Liebe-s-brief), Slavic, Dravidian, West African)\nse\n'back'\n\nneko-ze\n'hunchback'\nkaki\n'write'\nyoko-gaki\n'horizontal writing'\ntosi\n'year'\n\nhebi-dosi\n'snake year'\nsono\n'garden'\nhana-zono\n'flower garden'\no\nLyman's Law controls output of rendaku, which is blocked in the following:\nkado\n'corner'\nhito-kado\n'first point'\nsabi\n'rust'\n\naka sabi\n'red rust'\ntubo\n'jar'\n\ntya-tubo\n'tea jar'\n\n1 According to Tateishi (2003) the English plural morpheme in loans devoices in order to\nconform with\nLyman's Law: cars > kaazu, but Ladies > rediisu\n\ntozi\n'binding'\nkawa-tozi\n'leather binding'\nkurage 'jellyfish'\ndenki-kurage\n'electric jellyfish'\ntunagi\n'rosary link'\nzyuzu-tunagi\n'tied in a row'\ntokage 'lizard'\nao-tokage\n'green lizard'\no\nHere instead of a rule changing a coefficient to conform to a constraint, the constraint blocks the\napplication of a rule.\no\nWe can also ask if the \"redundant\" [+voice] in an NC cluster will \"activate\" Lyman's Law.\no\nThe answer is \"yes\".\n\nkangae 'thought' sirooto-kangae\n\n'layman's idea'\n\n[8] conclusion\n\no\nrules o f s ound change can either be blocked (e.g. rendaku) or be activated (post-nasal voicing) to\nconform to a constraint that also governs \"static\" generalizations over the lexicon.\no\nHow does one unify these disparate reflections of the post-nasal voicing generalization and Lyman's\nLaw into single grammatical statements?\no\nOT's answer is to dispense with rules entirely and express all phonological generalizations as\nconstraints.\n\n[9]. Problem of conspiracies: Kisseberth 1 970.

Another problem is\nan infinite regress: \"the wellformedness of a candidate word [pad] might depend on whether\nor not [pat] is a possible word. But to determine whether [pat] is a possible word, we have\nto determine whether or not is statisfies MinDist constraints, requiring it to be adequately\ndistinct from its neighbors, and so on\".\n-\nEF's claim is that we don't in general find these effects and the only response to a\nnonoptimal contrast is neutralization: in unstressed syllables distinctions are lost and the set\nof vowels shrinks rather than shifts (e.g. by introducing length); the only response to final\nvoiced obstruents is devoicing (loss of contrast towards articulatorily less effortful sound)\n-\nProposal is to restrict the role of dispersion constraints to defining the phonemic inventory\nthat encodes the lexicon and as a final \"quality check\" on the output of the input-output\nmapping in the ESC (Evaluation of Surface Contrast) module; in particular, dispersion\nconstraints cannot interact with (be ranked with) the markedness and faithfulness\nconstraints that define the input-output mapping.\nFlemming, Edward. \"The Role of Distinctiveness Constraints in Phonology.\" Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\n2006.

They deny this, at least for [voice], claiming that a voicing contrast can be\nimplemented by a variety of phonetic gestures whose d\nistribution and magnitude vary\naccording to context and no one gesture has privileged status. What unites them is a\nperceptual integration.\n-\nvoicing in sonorants, stops, and fricatives is phonetically diverse but yet they pattern as a\nnatural class for the past tense and plural allomorphs in English (assumes z and d are not the\ndefaults).\n-\npassive voicing is really actively and purposely produced\n-\nperceptual integration to give an \"intermediate perceptual property\" IPP. Performed by the\nauditory system and can occur even when sound in not heard as speech: low frequency of F0\n(and F1) with vocal fold vibration and duration of consonant with preceding vowel duration.\n-\npermits a more abstract view of a distinctive feature; so apparently VOT will integrate with\nhigh F0 to define the voiceless value signaling the open glottis gesture in the adjacent vowel.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n24.961 Introduction to Phonology\nFall 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

in Turkish labial harmony targets just high vowels while backness\nharmony targets both high and nonhigh vowels\n-\nin Western Mongolian non-high round vowels are restricted to first syllable; also there is\nno spread of [round] to later syllables, unlike in Turkish\n-\nparsing: extending a feature across a word makes pairs of words more distinct (Gallagher\n2010)\n-\narticulatory motivation: (rapid) shifts from [+F] to [-F] may require more effort than\nleaving the articulator in a single state\n[15] Transparency\n-\nTypically consonants are transparent for vowel harmony features unless they are specified\nfor features that are incompatible with the spreading feature such as palatality (high F2)\nand pharyngealization (low F2) in Arabic (Davis 1995).\n-\nvowels can be transparent for some consonantal features such as [anterior] in sibilant\nharmony; but in some cases the vowel might really be retroflexed but with minimal or no\nauditory effect.\n-\ngenuine transparency: the neutral vowels in Finnish and Hungarian and voiceless stops in\nnasal harmony languages\n-\nhow to treat these cases remains an outstanding problem\n\n-\nKiparsky & Pajusalu (2003) note that if Finnish /i/ and /e/ trigger harmony on back\nvowels then marked segments arise: [y] and [o] and [a]\n-\nFor them transparency arises from constraint conjunction: Agree[back] & ([-back] ->\n[-low, -round]) : a violation is assigned if there is an agree back violation and in\naddition if there is a back vowel in the harmonic domain, then the vowel is also not\n[-low, -round];
