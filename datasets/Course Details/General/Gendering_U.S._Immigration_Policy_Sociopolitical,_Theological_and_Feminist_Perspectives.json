The first half takes a closer look at the contemporary gender dynamics of U.S. immigration (also accounting for the intersecting effects of gender, race, sexuality, class and legacies of colonial/postcolonial power dynamics). This part of the course explores how gendered cultural constructs and structural processes have influenced the way that migrants, and especially migrant women, are incorporated into U.S. labor markets and the way that migrant workers and families are illegalized and constructed as targets for immigration enforcement.\n\nThe second half of the course focuses on ethical and theological perspectives on immigration policy. The framework for this part of the course is multilayered. It introduces students to the value orientations that have historically dominated the immigration policy debate (principally communitarian and cosmopolitan perspectives). It uses feminist social theory and feminist theology to re-frame the terms of this debate and to engage many of the issues (introduced in the first part of the class) that have been overlooked by more established perspectives. This part of the course also explores the sociopolitical and faith-based value systems of immigrant women, using them to further enrich our dialogue on immigration policy.\n\nThe Consortium for Graduate Studies in Gender, Culture, Women, and Sexuality (GCWS)\n\nThe GCWS at MIT brings together scholars and teachers at nine degree-granting institutions in the Boston area who are devoted to interdiscplinary graduate teaching, research, and scholarship in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. Learn more about the\nGCWS\n.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nStudents will develop a deeper understanding of the gendered dynamics shaping the contemporary workings of U.S immigration.\n\nStudents will learn about the value orientations that have historically defined U.S. immigration policy and will learn how the moral-ethical concerns of these value orientations are transformed by feminist ethics and theology.\n\nStudents will engage sociological, theological and feminist concepts, pertinent to the study of gender, immigrant-native born relations and immigration policy in a way that helps them to position their own moral-ethical standpoint (whether secular and/or theological) within a broader conversation.\n\nStudents will explore the interwoven dynamics of gender, sexuality, race, class, religion and postcolonialism as it pertains to the contemporary dynamics of immigration.\n\nStudents will produce research about immigrant communities and/or native born minority communities as it relates to the intersections of politics and policy, socioeconomic relations and/or faith communities from feminist perspectives. Their research will also contribute to an emerging dialogue about social justice, globalization and multiculturalism in a postcolonial U.S. context.\n\nRequired Books\n\nBenhabib, Seyla, and Judith Resnik.\nMigrations and Mobilities: Citizenship, Borders, and Gender.\nNYU Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780814776001.\n\nChoi Hee An.\nA Postcolonial Self: Korean Immigrant Theology and Church.\nStony Brook: State University of New York Press, 2016.

Students lose four points from their attendance score for every unexcused absence (\nsee course policies\non excused absences). Students may also lose up to two points per class for arriving late or leaving early. Points for tardiness or early departure may be waived if students give advanced notice. If a student accumulates three or more unexcused absences, they will earn a failing grade for the class. If a student accumulates three or more excused absences, they will not be automatically failed, but will have to meet with one or both instructors to determine whether they will be able to continue with the class. If it is not possible to work out a satisfactory agreement concerning minimal attendance and participation for the remainder of the course, the student will be required to withdraw from the course.\n\nParticipation\n\nStudents will receive 10 of the 20 points for this requirement for class participation. Optimal class participation includes making regular contributions to our small and large group discussions and making relevant and quality contributions. To meet this second criterion, it is essential that students read the required materials in a timely manner and demonstrate their familiarity with the readings in our class discussions. Students can expect to receive maximum points for class participation so long as they make a good faith effort to meet these requirements. However, students may lose up to three points each from their participation grade (for regularity and quality of participation) if they consistently fail to meet these standards throughout the course of the class.\n\nPlease see the\nAssignments\nsection for more information about other course requirements.\n\nGrading\n\nStudents will receive letter grades for this course. Grades will be assigned as follows, based on the total accumulated points received (100 point range) for al requirements.\n\nrequirement\n\nGrade\n\nExcellent in all respects\n\nA: 100-93\n\nGood in all and excellent in most respects\n\nA-: 90-92\n\nGood in all and excellent in a few respects\n\nB+: 87-89\n\nGood in all respects\n\nB: 83-86\n\nMinimally acceptable in all and good in most respects\n\nB-: 80-82\n\nMinimally acceptable in all and good in a few respects\n\nC+: 77-79\n\nMinimally acceptable in all respects\n\nC: 73-76\n\nLargely unacceptable\n\nC-: 70-72\n\nUnacceptable\n\nD+: 67-69\n\nUnacceptable\n\nD: 63-66\n\nUnacceptable\n\nD-: 60-62\n\nFailed\n\nF: 0-59\n\nCourse Policies\n\nPaper Formatting\n\nEntire document: Double-spaced, 12 point serif font (e.g., Times New Roman or Batang).

Students may receive an excused absence for medical emergencies (to care for themselves, a dependent, or close family member) or commitments connected to military service. Family events, commitments having to do with your regular work schedule, or attendance at special trainings and conferences do not count as excused absences. Please email the instructors in advance about both anticipated and unforeseen absences.\n\nPolicy on Late Assignments\n\nAll assignments must be submitted on or before the due dates, with exceptions only in extraordinary circumstances and with both instructors' prior approval.
