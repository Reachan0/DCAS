It revolves around complex analytic functions. These are functions that have a complex derivative. Unlike calculus using real variables, the mere existence of a complex derivative has strong implications for the properties of the function.\n\nComplex analysis is a basic tool in many mathematical theories. By itself and through some of these theories it also has a great many practical applications.\n\nThere are a small number of far-reaching theorems that we'll explore in the first part of the class. Along the way, we'll touch on some mathematical and engineering applications of these theorems. The last third of the class will be devoted to a deeper look at applications.\n\nThe main theorems are Cauchy's Theorem, Cauchy's integral formula, and the existence of Taylor and Laurent series. Among the applications will be harmonic functions, two-dimensional fluid flow, easy methods for computing (seemingly) hard integrals, Laplace transforms, and Fourier transforms with applications to engineering and physics.\n\nTextbook\n\nThere is no required textbook. We will use the following written resources:\n\nLecture Notes\n\nWe will occasionally use readings from the following online textbooks. You can also use them as supplemental reading.\n\nTaylor, Michael.\nIntroduction to Complex Analysis\n(PDF - 1.3MB)\n\nBeck, Matthias, Gerald Marchesi, Dennis Pixton, and Lucas Sabalka.\nA First Course in Complex Analysis\n(PDF - 1.5MB)\n\nBrown, James Ward and Ruel V. Churchill.\nComplex Variables and Applications.\n9th ed. McGraw-Hill Education, 2013. ISBN: 9780073383170.\n\nHomework and Exams\n\nThere are nine problem sets, two one-hour in-class exams, and a three-hour final exam.\n\nCollaboration\n\nMIT has a culture of teamwork. We encourage you to work with study partners.\n\nCollaboration on homework is encouraged.\n\nYou must write your solutions yourself, in your own words.\n\nYou must list all collaborators and outside sources of information.\n\nRemember it it is a serious violation of academic integrity to copy an answer without attribution.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem sets\n\n25%\n\nHour exams\n\n40%\n\nFinal exam\n\n35%\n\nIn addition, a passing grade on the final exam is required in order to pass the class.",

      "content": "18.02 Review\nJeremy Orloff\n1 Review of multivariable calculus (18.02) constructs\n1.1 Introduction\nThese notes are a terse summary of what we'll need from multivariable calculus. If, after reading\nthese, some parts are still unclear, you should consult your notes or book from your multivariable\ncalculus or ask about it at office hours. We've also posted a more detailed review of line integrals\nand Green's theorem. You should consult that if needed.\nWe've seen that complex exponentials make trigonometric functions easier to work with and give\ninsight into many of the properties of trig functions. Similarly, we'll eventually reformulate some\nmaterial from 18.02 in complex form. We'll see that it's easier to present and the main properties\nare more transparent in complex form.\n1.2 Terminology and notation\nVectors. We'll denote vectors in the plane by (�, �)\nNote. In physics and in 18.02 we usually write vectors in the plane as �� + ��. This use of � and �\nwould be confusing in 18.04, so we will write this vector as (�, �).\nIn 18.02 you might have used angled brackets ⟨�, �⟩ for vectors and round brackets (�, �) for points.\nIn 18.04 we will adopt the more standard mathematical convention and use round brackets for both\nvectors and points. It shouldn't lead to any confusion.\nOrthogonal. Orthogonal is a synonym for perpendicular. Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot\nproduct is zero, i.e. � = (�1, �2) and � = (�1, �2) are orthogonal if\n� ⋅ � = (�1, �2) ⋅ (�1, �2) = �1�1 + �2�2 = 0.\nComposition. Composition of functions will be denoted � (�(�)) or � *�(�), which is read as '�\ncomposed with �'\n1.3 Parametrized curves\nWe often use the greek letter gamma for a paramtrized curve, i.e.\n�(�) = (�(�), �(�)).\nWe think of this as a moving point tracing out a curve in the plane. The tangent vector\n� ′(�) = (� ′(�), � ′(�))\nis tangent to the curve at the point (�(�), �(�)). It's length |� ′(�)| is the instantaneous speed of the\nmoving point.\n\n|||\n|||\n1 REVIEW OF MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS (18.02) CONSTRUCTS\nx\ny\nγ(t)\nγ′(t)\nγ′(t)\nParametrized curve �(�) with some tangent vectors � ′(�).\nExample Rev.1. Parametrize the straight line from the point (�0, �0) to (�1, �1).\nSolution: There are always many parametrizations of a given curve. A standard one for straight lines\nis\n�(�) = (�, �) = (�0, �0) + �(�1 - �0, �1 - �0), with 0 ≤ � ≤ 1.\nExample Rev.2. Parametrize the circle of radius � around the point (�0, �0).\nSolution: Again there are many parametrizations. Here is the standard one with the circle traversed\nin the counterclockwise direction:\n�(�) = (�, �) = (�0, �0) + �(cos(�), sin(�)), with 0 ≤ � ≤ 2�.\nx\ny\n(x0, y0)\n(x1, y1)\nr\nLine from (�0, �0) to (�1, �1) and circle around (�0, �0).\n1.4 Chain rule\nFor a function � (�, �) and a curve �(�) = (�(�), �(�)) the chain rule gives\n�� (�(�))\n��\n��\n=\n� ′(�) +\n� ′(�) = �� (�(�)) ⋅ � ′(�) dot product of vectors.\n��\n�� |�(�)\n�� |�(�)\nHere �� is the gradient of � defined in the next section.\n1.5 Grad, curl and div\nGradient. For a function � (�, �), the gradient is defined as grad� = �� = (��, ��). A vector field\n� which is the gradient of some function is called a gradient vector field.\nCurl. For a vector in the plane �(�, �) = (�(�, �), �(�, �)) we define\ncurl� = �� - ��.\n\n1 REVIEW OF MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS (18.02) CONSTRUCTS\nNote. The curl is a scalar. In 18.02 and in general, the curl of a vector field is another vector field.\nHowever, for vectors fields in the plane the curl is always in the � direction, so we have simply\ndropped the � and made curl a scalar.\nDivergence. The divergence of the vector field � = (�, �) is\ndiv� = �� + ��.\n1.6 Level curves\nRecall that the level curves of a function � (�, �) are the curves given by � (�, �) = constant.\nRecall also that the gradient �� is orthogonal to the level curves of �\n1.7 Line integrals\nThe ingredients for line (also called path or contour) integrals are the following:\n- A vector field � = (�, �)\n- A curve �(�) = (�(�), �(�)) defined for � ≤ � ≤ �\nThen the line integral of � along � is defined by\n�\n� ⋅ �� = ∫\n�(�(�)) ⋅ � ′(�)�� = ∫�\n��� + ���.\n∫�\n�\nExample Rev.3. Let � = (-�∕�2, �∕�2) and let � be the unit circle. Compute line integral of � along\n�.\nSolution: You should be able to supply the answer to this example\n1.7.1 Properties of line integrals\n1. Independent of parametrization.\n2. Reverse direction on curve ⇒ change sign. That is,\n� ⋅ ��.\n� ⋅ �� = - ∫�\n∫-�\n(Here, -� means the same curve traversed in the opposite direction.)\n3. If � is closed then we sometimes indicate this with the notation ∮�\n� ⋅ �� = ∮�\n� �� + � ��.\n\n1 REVIEW OF MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS (18.02) CONSTRUCTS\n1.7.2 Fundamental theorem for gradient fields\nTheorem Rev.4. (Fundamental theorem for gradient fields)\nIf � = �� then ∫ � ⋅ �� = � (� ) - � (�), where �, � are the beginning and endpoints respectively\n�\nof �.\nProof. By the chain rule we have\n�� (�(�)) = �� (�(�)) ⋅ � ′(�) = �(�(�)) ⋅ � ′(�).\n��\nThe last equality follows from our assumption that � = �� . Now we can this when we compute the\nline integral:\n�\n� ⋅ �� = ∫\n�(�(�)) ⋅ � ′(�) ��\n∫�\n�\n� �� (�(�)) ��\n= ∫\n��\n�\n= � (�(�)) - � (�(�))\n= � (� ) - � (�)\nNotice that the third equality follows from the fundamental theorem of calculus.\nDefinition. If a vector field � is a gradient field, with � = �� , then we call � a a potential function\nfor �.\nNote: the usual physics terminology would be to call -� the potential function for �.\n1.7.3 Path independence and conservative functions\nDefinition. For a vector field �, the line integral ∫ � ⋅ �� is called path independent if, for any two\npoints � and �, the line integral has the same value for every path between � and �.\nTheorem. ∫�\n� ⋅ �� is path independent is equivalent to ∮�\n� ⋅ �� = 0 for any closed path.\nSketch of proof. Draw two paths from � to � . Following one from � to � and the reverse of the\nother back to � is a closed path. The equivalence follows easily. We refer you to the more detailed\nreview of line integrals and Green's theorem for more details.\nDefinition. A vector field with path independent line integrals, equivalently a field whose line inte\ngrals around any closed loop is 0 is called a conservative vector field.\nTheorem Rev.5. We have the following equivalence: On a connected region, a gradient field is\nconservative and a conservative field is a gradient field.\nProof. Again we refer you to the more detailed review for details. Essentially, if � is conservative\nthen we can define a potential function � (�, �) as the line integral of � from some base point to (�, �).\n1.8 Green's Theorem\nIngredients: � a simple closed curve (i.e. no self-intersection), and � the interior of �.\n\n1 REVIEW OF MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS (18.02) CONSTRUCTS\n� must be positively oriented (traversed so interior region � is on the left) and piecewise smooth (a\nfew corners are okay).\nx\ny\nR\nC\nR\nC\nR\nC\nTheorem Rev.6.

See the more detailed notes on Green's theorem and line integrals for\nthe proof.\n1.9 Extensions and applications of Green's theorem\n1.9.1 Simply connected regions\nDefinition: A region � in the plane is simply connected if it has \"no holes\". Said differently, it is\nsimply connected for every simple closed curve � in �, the interior of � is fully contained in �.\nExamples:\nD1\nD2\nD3\nx\ny\nD4\nx\ny\nD5 = whole plane\nD1-D5 are simply connected. For any simple closed curve � inside any of these regions the interior\nof � is entirely inside the region.\nNote. Sometimes we say any curve can be shrunk to a point without leaving the region.\nThe regions below are not simply connected. For each, the interior of the curve � is not entirely in\nthe region.\n\n1 REVIEW OF MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS (18.02) CONSTRUCTS\nC\nAnnulus\nx\ny\nC\nPunctured plane\n1.9.2 Potential Theorem\nHere is an application of Green's theorem which tells us how to spot a conservative field on a simply\nconnected region. The theorem does not have a standard name, so we choose to call it the Potential\nTheorem.\nTheorem Rev.7. (Potential Theorem) Take � = (�, �) defined and differentiable on a region �.\n(a) If � = �� then curl� = �� - �� = 0.\n(b) If � is simply connected and curl� = 0 on �, then � = �� for some � .\nWe know that on a connected region, being a gradient field is equivalent to being conservative. So we\ncan restate the Potential Theorem as: on a simply connected region, � is conservative is equivalent\nto curl� = 0.\n(\n)\nProof of (a): � = ��, �� , so curl� = ��� - ��� = 0.\nProof of (b): Suppose � is a simple closed curve in �. Since � is simply connected the interior\nof � is also in �. Therefore, using Green's theorem we have,\n� ⋅ ��\ncurl� �� = 0.\n∮�\n= ∫∫�\nx\ny\nD\nC\nR\nThis shows that � is conservative in �. Therefore, by Theorem Rev.5 � is a gradient field.\nSummary: Suppose the vector field � = (�, �) is defined on a simply connected region �. Then,\nthe following statements are equivalent.\n�\n(1) ∫\n� ⋅ �� is path independent.\n�\n(2) ∮�\n� ⋅ �� = 0 for any closed path �.\n(3) � = �� for some � in �\n(4) � is conservative in �.\nIf � is continuously differentiable then 1,2,3,4 all imply 5:\n(5) curl� = �� - �� = 0 in �\n\n1 REVIEW OF MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS (18.02) CONSTRUCTS\n1.9.3 Why we need simply connected in the Potential Theorem\nIf there is a hole then � might not be defined on the interior of �. (See the example on the tangential\nfield below.)\nD\nC\n1.9.4 Extended Green's Theorem\nWe can extend Green's theorem to a region � which has multiple boundary curves.\nSuppose � is the region between the two simple closed curves �1 and �2.\nC1\nC2\nR\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC4\nR\n(Note � is always to the left as you traverse either curve in the direction indicated.)\nThen we can extend Green's theorem to this setting by\ncurl� ��.\n� ⋅ �� + ∮�2\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�\n∮�1\nLikewise for more than two curves:\ncurl� ��.\n� ⋅ �� + ∮�2\n� ⋅ �� + ∮�3\n� ⋅ �� + ∮�4\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�\n∮�1\nProof. The proof is based on the following figure. We 'cut' both �1 and �2 and connect them by two\ncopies of �3, one in each direction. (In the figure we have drawn the two copies of �3 as separate\ncurves, in reality they are the same curve traversed in opposite directions.)\nNow the curve � = �1 + �3 + �2 - �3 is a simple closed curve and Green's theorem holds on it.\nBut the region inside � is exactly � and the contributions of the two copies of �3 cancel. That is,\nwe have shown that\ncurl� �� = ∫�1+�3+�2-�3\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�1+�2\n� ⋅ ��.\n∫∫�\nThis is exactly Green's theorem, which we wanted to prove.\n\n1 REVIEW OF MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS (18.02) CONSTRUCTS\nC1\nC2\nC3\n-C3\nThe punctured plane.\n(-�, �)\nExample Rev.8.

      "content": "Line Integrals and Green's Theorem\nJeremy Orloff\n1 Vector Fields (or vector valued functions)\nVector notation. In 18.04 we will mostly use the notation (�) = (�, �√) for vectors. The other\ncommon notation (�) = �� + �� runs the risk of � being confused with � =\n-1 -especially if I forget\nto make � boldfaced.\nDefinition. A vector field (also called called a vector-valued function) is a function �(�, �) from �2\nto �2. That is,\n�(�, �) = (�(�, �), �(�, �)),\nwhere � and � are regular functions on the plane. In standard physics notation\n�(�, �) = �(�, �)� + �(�, �)� = (�, �) .\nAlgebraically, a vector field is nothing more than two ordinary functions of two variables.\nExample GT.1. Here are a number of standard examples of vector fields.\n(a.1) Force: constant gravitational field �(�, �) = (0, -�).\n(a.2) Velocity:\n(\n)\n(\n)\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�(�, �) =\n=\n.\n�2 + �2 , �2 + �2\n�2 , �2\n(Here � is our usual polar �.)

It\nis a shrinking radial field -like water pouring from a source at (0,0).\nThis vector field exhibits another important feature for us: it is not defined at the origin because the\ndenominator becomes zero there. We will say that � has a singularity at the origin.\n(a.3) Unit tangential field:\n� = (-�, �) ∕�. Tangential means tangent to circles centered at the\norigin. We know it is tangential because it is orthogonal to the radial vector field in (a.2). � also has\na singularity at the origin.

Sketch the vector fields, (a.1), (a.2) and (a.3) from the previous example.\n\n2 DEFINITION AND COMPUTATION OF LINE INTEGRALS ALONG A PARAMETRIZED CURVE2\nx\ny\n(a.1) Constant vector field\nx\ny\n(a.2) Shrinking radial field\nx\ny\n(a.3) Unit tangential field\n2 Definition and computation of line integrals along a parametrized\ncurve\nLine integrals are also called path or contour integrals.\nWe need the following ingredients:\nA vector field �(�, �) = (�, �)\nA parametrized curve �: �(�) = (�(�), �(�)), with � running from � to �.\nNote: since � = (�, �), we have �� = (��, ��).\nDefinition. The line integral of � along � is defined as\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�\n(�, �) ⋅ (��, ��) = ∫�\n� �� + � ��.\n∫�\nComment: The notation �⋅�� is common in physics and � ��+� �� in thermodynamics. (Though\neveryone uses both notations.)\nWe'll see what these notations mean in practice with some examples.\n(\n)\n(\n)\nExample GT.3. Let �(�, �) = �2�, � -2� and let � be the curve �(�) = �, �2 , with � running\nfrom 0 to 1. Compute the line integral �\n� ⋅ ��.\n= ∫�\nDo this first using the notation ∫�\n� �� + � ��. Then repeat the computation using the notation\n� ⋅ ��.\n∫�\nSolution: First we draw the curve, which is the part of the parabola � = �2 running from (0, 0) to\n(1, 1).\n\n3 WORK DONE BY A FORCE ALONG A CURVE\nx\ny\nC\n(i) Using the notation ∫�\n� �� + � ��.\nWe have � = (�, �), so � = �, � = �2. In this notation � = (�, �), so � = �2� and � = � -2�.\nWe put everything in terms of �:\n�� = ��\n�� = 2� ��\n� = (�2)(�2) = �4\n� = � -2�2\nNow we can put all of these in the integral. Since � runs from 0 to 1, these are our limits.\n�\n� �� + � �� = ∫\n�4 �� + (� -2�2)2� �� = ∫\n�4 + 2�2 -4�3 �� = -2\n15.\n= ∫�\n(ii) Using the notation ∫�\n� ⋅ ��.\nAgain, we have to put everything in terms of �:\n(\n)\n� = (�, �) = �4 , � -2�2\n��\n��\n= (1, 2�) , so � � =\n�� = (1, 2�) ��\n��\n��\n(\n)\nThus, � ⋅ �� = �4 , � -2�2 ⋅ (1, 2�) �� = �4 + (� -2�2)2� ��. So the integral becomes\n�\n� ⋅ �� = ∫\n�4 + (� -2�2)2� ��.\n= ∫�\nThis is exactly the same integral as in method (i).\n3 Work done by a force along a curve\nHaving seen that line integrals are not unpleasant to compute, we will now try to motivate our interest\nin doing so. We will see that the work done by a force moving a body along a path is naturally\ncomputed as a line integral.\nSimilar to integrals we've seen before, the work integral will be constructed by dividing the path into\nlittle pieces. The work on each piece will come from a basic formula and the total work will be the\n'sum' over all the pieces, i.e. an integral.\n\n3 WORK DONE BY A FORCE ALONG A CURVE\n3.1 Basic formula: work done by a constant force along a small line\nWe'll start with the simplest situation: a constant force � pushes a body a distance Δ� along a straight\nline. Our goal is to compute the work done by the force.\nThe figure shows the force � which pushes the body a distance Δ� along a line in the direction of\nthe unit vector �. The angle between the force � and the direction � is �.\nbT=unit vector\nlength=∆s\nvector=∆r = ∆s bT\nF\nθ\nWe know from physics that the work done by the force on the body is the component of the force in\nthe direction of motion times the distance moved. That is,\nwork = |�| cos(�) Δ�\nWe want to phrase this in terms of vectors. Since |�| = 1 we know � ⋅ � = |�| cos(�). Using this in\nthe formula for work we have\nwork = � ⋅ � Δ�.\n(1)\nEquation 1 is important and we will see it again. For now, we want to make one more substitution.\nWe'll call the vector Δ� � = Δ�. This is the displacement of the body. (Note, it is essentially the\n\nsame as our formula �� � = �� .) Using this, Equation 1 becomes\n��\n��\nwork = � ⋅ Δ�.\n(2)\nThis is the basic work formula that we'll use to compute work along an entire curve\n3.2 Work done by a variable force along an entire curve\nNow suppose a variable force � moves a body along a curve �. Our goal is to compute the total\nwork done by the force.\nThe figure shows the curve broken into 5 small pieces, the �th piece has displacement Δ��. If the\npieces are small enough, then the force on the �th piece is approximately constant. This is shown as\n�� .\n∆r1\n∆r2\n∆r3\n∆r4\n∆r5\nF1\nF2\nF3\nF4\nF5\nAlso, if the pieces are small enough, then each segment is approximately a straight line and the force\nis approximately constant. So we can apply our basic formula for work and approximate the work\n\n4 GRAD, CURL AND DIV\ndone by the force moving the body along the �th piece as\nΔ�� ≈ �� ⋅ Δ��.\nThe total work is the sum of the work over each piece.\ntotal work =\n∑\nΔ�� ≈\n∑\n�� ⋅ Δ��.\nNow, as usual, we let the pieces get infinitesimally small, so the sum becomes an integral and the\napproximation becomes exact. We get:\ntotal work\n� ⋅ ��.\n= ∫�\nThe subscript � indicates that it is the curve that has been split into pieces. That is, the total work is\ncomputed as a line integral of the force over the curve �!\n4 Grad, curl and div\nGradient. For a function � (�, �): grad� = �� = (��, ��).\nCurl. For a vector in the plane �(�, �) = (�(�, �), �(�, �)) we define\ncurl� = �� - ��.\nNOTE. This is a scalar. In general, the curl of a vector field is another vector field. For vectors fields\nin the plane the curl is always in the � direction, so we simply drop the � and make curl a scalar.\nSometimes it is called the 'baby curl'.\nDivergence. The divergence of the vector field � = (�, �) is\ndiv� = �� + ��.\n5 Properties of line integrals\nIn this section we will uncover some properties of line integrals by working some examples.\nExample GT.4. First look back at the value found in Example GT.3. Now, use the same vector field\nas in that example, but, in this case, let � be the straight line from (0, 0) to (1, 1), i.e. same endpoints,\nbut different path. Compute the line integral ∫�\n� ⋅ ��.\nSolution: As always, start by sketching the curve:\nx\ny\nC\n\n5 PROPERTIES OF LINE INTEGRALS\nWe'll use the notation ∫�\n� �� + � ��.\nParametrize the curve: � = �, � = �, with � from 0 to 1.\nPut everything in terms of �:\n�� = ��\n�� = ��\n� = �2� = �3\n� = � -2� = -�\nNow we put this into the integral\n�\n� �� + � �� = ∫\n�3 �� - � �� = ∫\n�3 - � �� = -4\n1 .\n= ∫�\nThis is a different value from Example GT.3, which leads to the important principle:\nImportant principle for line integrals. Line integrals over two different paths with the same end\npoints may be different.\nExample GT.5. Again, look back at the value found in Example GT.3. Now, use the same vector\nfield and curve as Example GT.3 except use the following (different) parametrization of �.\n� = sin(�),\n� = sin2(�);\n0 ≤ � ≤ �∕2.\nCompute the line integral ∫�\n� ⋅ ��.\nSolution: We won't sketch the curve it is identical to the one in Example GT.3. Putting everything\nin terms of � we have\n�� = cos(�) ��\n�� = 2 sin(�) cos(�) ��\n� = �2� = sin2(�) sin2(�) = sin4(�)\n� = � -2� = sin(�) - 2 sin2(�)\nWe put these in the integral �\n� �� + � �� and compute\n= ∫�\n�∕2\n� = ∫\nsin4(�) cos(�) �� + (sin(�) - 2 sin2(�))2 sin(�) cos(�) ��\n�∕2 (\n)\n= ∫\nsin4(�) + 2 sin2(�) - 4 sin3(�) cos(�) ��\n(Let � = sin(�), �� = cos(�) ��.)\n= ∫\n�4 + 2�2 -4�3 ��\n= -2\n15.\n\n5 PROPERTIES OF LINE INTEGRALS\nThis is the same value we got in Example GT.3! In fact, the � substitution led to exactly the same\nintegral! This leads us to the important principle:\nImportant principle for line integrals. The parametrization of the curve doesn't affect the value\nof line the integral over the curve.\nYou should note that our work with work make this reasonable, since we developed the line integral\nabstractly, without any reference to a parametrization.\n5.1 List of properties of line integrals\n1. Independent of parametrization: The value of the line integral ∫�\n� ⋅ �� is independent of the\nparametrization of �.\n2. Reversing direction on the curve changes the sign: If � is a curve, then we write -� for the\nsame curve traversed in the opposite direction. In this case\n� ⋅ ��\n� ⋅ ��.\n∫-�\n= - ∫�\n(See the next example.)\nExample GT.6. Let � be the curve from Example GT.3. Sketch � and -� and give a parametriza\ntion of -�.\nSolution: � follows the parabola � = �2 from (0,0) to (1,1), so the curve -� covers the same section\nof the parabola, but goes from (1,1) to (0,0), i.e. we reversed the direction of the arrow.\nx\ny\nC\nC goes from (0,0) to (1,1)\nx\ny\n-C\n-C goes from (1,1) to (0,0)\n(\n)\nThe curve � can be parametrized as �(�) = �, �2 , with � running from 0 to 1. The easiest way to\nreverse this is to have � run from 1 to 0\nWith this parametrization the � limits on the integral are reversed, which, we know from 18.01,\nchanges the sign of the integral.\nIf you insist on an increasing parameter, we can parametrize -� by\n(\n)\n�(�) = 1 - �, (1 - �)2 , with � runnning from 0 to 1.\n3.

Because �� = 0 on �1 and �� = 0 on �2 we can write\n� �� + � �� = ∫�1\n� �� + ∫�2\n� ��.\n∫�1+�2\nUsing the shorthand will save us some writing in the future.\nExample GT.8. Evaluate �\n-� �� + � �� where � is the unit circle traversed in a counter\n= ∮�\nclockwise (CCW) direction.\nSolution: Parametrization:\n� = cos(�), � = sin(�), 0 ≤ � ≤ 2�.

We put this into Wolfram Alpha and found �2 = 0.\nNote. We should suspect that the value of 0 is no accident. This is true and we will see it easily once\nwe learn Green's theorem. Avoiding actually computing an integral like this should be motivation\nenough for us to learn Green's theorem.\n18.01 challenge. Compute the integral for �2. Hints: You can use the substitution � = tan(�∕2) and\npartial fractions. It's best to use symmetry and compute 2 times the integral from 0 to �.\n\n8 GRADIENT AND CONSERVATIVE FIELDS\n8 Gradient and conservative fields\nWe will now focus on the important case where � is a gradient field. That is, for some function\n� (�, �),\n(\n)\n� = �� = ��, �� .\nNote. We will learn to call � a potential function for �.\n8.1 The fundamental theorem for gradient fields\nTheorem GT.11. (fundamental theorem for gradient fields) Suppose that � = �� is a gradient field\nand � is any path from point � to point �. The fundamental theorem for vector fields says\n∫�\n� ⋅ �� = � (�, �)|� = � (�) - � (� ) = � (�1, �1) - � (�0, �0).\n(3)\n�\nwhere � = (�0, �0) and � = (�1, �1).\nThat is, for gradient fields the line integral depends only on the endpoints of the path and is inde\npendent of the path taken.\nx\ny\nC1\nP = (x0, y0)\nQ = (x1, y1)\nC2\nIf � = �� then ∫�1\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�2\n� ⋅ �� = � (�) - � (� ).\nThe proof of the fundamental theorem is given after the next example\nExample GT.12. Let � (�, �) = ��3 + �2 and let � be the curve shown. Compute � = �� and\ncompute ∫�\n� ⋅ �� two ways: (i) directly as a line integral, (ii) using the fundamental theorem.\nx\ny\nC\n(0, 0)\n(1, 2)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nSolution: �(�, �) = �� ��, �� = �3 + 2�, 3��2\n\n8 GRADIENT AND CONSERVATIVE FIELDS\n(i) Parametrize �: � = �, � = 2�, � runs from 0 to 1.\nWrite everything in terms of �:\n�� = ��,\n�� = 2 ��,\n� = �3 + 2� = 8�3 + 2�,\n� = 3��2 = 12�3 .\nPut all this into the integral and compute:\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�\n(�3 + 2�) �� + 3��2 �� = ∫ (8�3 + 2�) �� + 12�32 �� = ∫\n32�3 + 2� �� = 9.\n∫�\n(ii) By the fundamental theorem\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�\n�� ⋅ �� = � (1, 2) - � (0, 0) = 9.\n∫�\nYou decide which method is easier!\n8.2 Proof of the fundamental theorem\nProof. The proof uses the definition of line integral together with the chain rule and the usual fun\ndamental theorem of calculus.\nWe assume the following:\n(i) � = ��\n(ii) The curve � is parametrized by �(�) = (�(�), �(�)), with � running from �0 to �1 and �(�0) = � ,\n�(�1) = �.\nFirst recall the for a parametrized curve �(�) the chain rule says\n�� (�(�))\n��\n��\n��\n= ��\n+ ��\n= �� ⋅\n.\n��\n��\n��\n��\nSo,\n�1\n�1\n��\n�� (�(�))\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�\n�� ⋅ �� = ∫\n�� ⋅\n�� = ∫\n��\n��\n��\n∫�\n�0\n�0\n= � (�(�))|�1 = � (�(�1)) - � (�(�0)) = � (�) - � (� )\nQED\n�0\n8.3 Path independence\nDefinition. For a vector field � we say that the line integrals ∫�\n� ⋅ �� are path independent if for\nany two points � and � the integral yields the same value for every path connecting � to �.\nFrom the fundamental theorem we can conclude: if � = �� is a gradient field, then the integrals\n� ⋅ �� are path independent.\n∫�\nThe following theorem offers an alternative way to express path independence.\nTheorem GT.13. For a given vector field �, the line integrals ∫�\n� ⋅ �� are path independent is\nequivalent to ∮��\n� ⋅ �� = 0 for any closed path �� .\n\n8 GRADIENT AND CONSERVATIVE FIELDS\nProof. To show equivalence we need to show two things:\n(i) Path independence implies the line integral around any closed path is 0.\n(ii) The line integral around all closed paths is 0 implies path independence.\nProof (i). To start, note that the constant path �0 where �(�) = �0, with � running from 0 to 0 has\nline integral\n� ⋅ �� = ∫\n� ⋅ � �� = 0.\n∮�0\nAssume path independence and consider the closed path �� shown in Figure (i) below. Since both\n�� and �0 have the same start and end points, path independence says the line integrals are the same,\ni.e.\n� ⋅ ��\n� ⋅ �� = 0.\n∮��\n= ∮�0\nThis proves (i).\n(ii) Assume ∮��\n� ⋅ �� = 0 for any closed curve. Consider two paths between � and � as shown\nin Figure (ii). The curve �� = �1 - �2 is a closed curve starting and ending at � . Therefore, by\nassumption ∮��\n� ⋅ �� = 0. So\n� ⋅ ��\n� ⋅ �� = ∮�1-�2\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�1\n� ⋅ �� - ∫�2\n0 = ∫��\nThis implies ∫�1\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�2\n� ⋅ ��. That is, the integral is the same for all paths from � to �, i.e.\nthe line integrals are path independent.\nx\ny\nCc\nP = Q\nFigure (i)\nx\ny\nC2\nC1\nP\nQ\nFigure (ii)\n8.4 Conservative vector fields\nGiven a vector field �, Theorem GT.13 in the previous section said that the line integrals of � were\npath independent is equivalent to the line integral of � around any closed path is 0. Following physics\nterminology, we call such a vector field a conservative vector field.\nThe fundamental theorem says the if � is a gradient field: � = �� , then the line integral ∫�\n� ⋅ ��\nis path independent. That is,\n\n|||\n8 GRADIENT AND CONSERVATIVE FIELDS\na gradient field is conservative.\nThe following theorem says that the converse is also true on connected regions. By a connected\nregion we mean that any two points in the region can be connected by a continuous path that lies\nentirely in the region.\nTheorem GT.14. A conservative field on a connected region is a gradient field.\nProof. Call the region �. We have to show that if we have a conservative field � = (�, �) on �\nthe there is a potential function � with � = �� .\nThe easy part will be defining � . The trickier part will be showing that its gradient is �. So, first we\ndefine � : Fix a point (�0, �0) in �. Then for any point (�, �) in � we define\n� (�, �) = ∫�\n� ⋅ ��, where � is any path from (�0, �0) to (�, �).\nPath independence guarantees that � (�, �) is well defined, i.e. it doesn't depend on the choice of\npath.\nNow we need to show that � = �� , i.e if � = (�, �), then we need to show that �� = � and\n�� = �. We'll show the first case, the case �� = � is essentially the same. First, note that by\ndefinition\n�� (� + �, �)\n��(�, �) =\n.\n��\n|�=0\nThe function � (� + �, �) is defined in terms of a line integral. So, we need to write down this integral\nand differentiate it.\nIn the figure below, � (�, �) is the integral along the path �1 from (�0, �0) to (�, �) and � (� + �, �)\nis the integral along �1 + �2, where �2 is the horizontal line segment from (�, �) to (� + �, �). This\nmeans that\n� (� + �, �) = ∫�1\n� ⋅ �� + ∫�2\n� ⋅ �� = � (�, �) + ∫�2\n� ⋅ ��.\n(x0, y0)\n(x, y)\n(x + t, y)\nγ1\nγ2\nD\nWe need to parameterize the horizontal segment �2. Notationwise, the letters �, � and � are already\ntaken, so we let �2(�) = (�(�), �(�), where\n�(�) = � + �, �(�) = �; with 0 ≤ � ≤ �\nOn this segment �� = �� and �� = 0. So,\n�\n� (� + �, �) = � (�, �) + ∫ �(� + �, �) ��\n\n|||\n9 POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS\nThe piece � (�, �) is constant as � varies, so the fundamental theorem of calculus says that\n�� (� + �, �) = �(� + �, �).\n��\nSetting � = 0 we have\n�� (� + �, �)\n��(�, �) =\n= �(�, �).\n��\n|�=0\nThis is exactly what we needed to show! We summarize in a box:\nOn a connected region a conservative field is a gradient field.\nExample GT.15. If � is the electric field of an electric charge it is conservative.\nExample GT.16. A gravitational field of a mass is conservative.\n9 Potential functions\nDefinition. If � = �� is a gradient vector field then we call � a potential function for �.\nNote. The usual physics terminology would be to call -� the potential function for �.\nThis section is devoted to answering two questions.\n1. How do we know if a vector field � is a gradient vector field, i.e. if � = �� for some potential\nfunction � ?\n2. If it exists, how do we find the potential function � ?\n9.1 First answers to our questions\nTheorem GT.17. Suppose � = (�, �). We have the following answer to our two questions.\n��\n(a) If � = �� , then �� =\n, i.e. �� = ��.\n��\n��\n(b) If �� = �� in the whole plane then � is a gradient vector field, i.e � = �� for some potential\nfunction � .\n(c) If � is conservative on a connected region, then � is a gradient field.\nNotes. The restriction that � is defined on the whole plane is too stringent for our needs. Below, we\nwill give what we call the Potential theorem, which only requires that � be defined and differentiable\non what is called a 'simply connected region'.\nProof of (a). If � = (�, �) = �� then � = �� and � = ��. This implies,\n�� = ��� and �� = ���, i.e �� = ��. QED.\n(Provided � has continuous second partials.)\nThe proof of (b) will be postponed until after we have proved Green's theorem and we can state the\nPotential theorem. Part (c) is just a restatement of Theorem GT.14. The examples below will show\nhow to find �\n(\n)\nExample GT.18. For which values of the constants � and � will � = ���, �2 + �� be a gradient\nfield?\n\n9 POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS\nSolution: �� = ��, �� = 2�. To apply the theorem we need �� = �� in the entire plane. So,\n� = 2 and � is arbitrary.\n(\n)\nExample GT.19. Is � = (3�2 + �), e�\nconservative?\n(\n)\nSolution: First we check if it is a gradient field: We write � = (�, �) = 3�2 + �, e� . Then,\n= e�\n�� = 1, ��\n. Since �� = ��, � is not a gradient field. Now, Theorem GT.17(c) says it can't\nbe conservative.\n(-�, �)\nExample GT.20. Is\nconservative?\n�2 + �2\nSolution: NO! The reasoning is a little trickier than in the previous example. First, it is not hard to\ncompute that\n�2 - �2\n�� =\n= ��.\n(�2 + �2)2\nBUT, since the field is not defined for all (�, �), Theorem GT.17(b) does not apply. So, all we can\nsay at this point is that we haven't ruled out its being conservative.\nTo show that it's not conservative we will find a closed path where the line integral is not 0. In fact,\nwe will use our super-duper important example from above.\nLet � = unit circle parametrized by � = cos(�), � = sin(�).\nWriting everything in terms of �:\n�\n�\n�� = - sin(�) ��,\n�� = cos(�) ��,\n� = -\n= -sin(�),\n� =\n= cos(�).\n�2 + �2\n�2 + �2\nPutting this in the line integral\n2�\n2�\n� ⋅ �� = ∮�\n� �� + � �� = ∮\nsin2(�) + cos2(�) �� = ∫\n�� = 2�\n∮�\nSince this is not 0, the field is not conservative.\n(�, �)\nExample GT.21. Is � =\nconservative?\n�2 + �2\nSolution: Again it is easy to check that �� = ��, BUT since � is not defined at (0, 0) Theorem\nGT.17(b) does not apply. HOWEVER, it turns out that\n√\n� = � ln( �2 + �2) = � ln �\nSince � is a gradient field, it is conservative. (Officially, we should say, � is conservative on the\nregion consisting of the plane minus the origin.)\n9.2 Finding the potential function\nWe will show two methods for finding the potential functions. In general, for 18.04 the method of\nintegrating along a rectangular path is more relevant.\n(\n)\nExample GT.22. Show that � = 3�2 + 6��, 3�2 + 6� is conservative and find the potential func\ntion � such that � = �� .\nSolution: We have � = (�, �), where � = 3�2 + 6��, � = 3�2 + 6�.\n\n9 POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS\nFirst, �� = 6� = ��. Since � is defined for all (�, �) Theorem GT.17 implies � is a gradient field,\nhence conservative.\nMethod 1 for finding � .\nSince � is a gradient field we know ∫�\n� ⋅ �� = � (�) - � (� ) for any path from � to �. We make\nuse of this by letting � be a rectangular path from the origin to an arbitrary point � = (�1, �1) (see\nfigure).\nx\ny\nC1\nC2\ny1\nQ = (x1, y1)\nRectangular path from the origin to �.\nWe know ∫�1+�2\n� ⋅ �� = � (�1, �1) - � (0, 0). So\n� (�1, �1) = ∫�1+�2\n� ⋅ �� + � (0, 0).\nOn the rectangular path shown �� = 0 on �1 and �� = 0 on �2. Therefore,\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�1\n� �� + ∫�2\n� ��.\n∫�1+�2\nThese integrals are straightforward to compute. We do each one separately.\nIntegral over �1:\nParametrize �1: parameter = �: � = 0, � = �, � runs from 0 to �1.\nPut everything we need in terms of the parameter �:\n�� = ��,\n� = 3�2 + 6� = 6�.\nPut this in the integral and compute\n�1\n� �� = ∫\n6� �� = 3�2\n1.\n∫�1\nIntegral over �2 ∶\nParameter = �: � = �, � = �1, � runs from 0 to �1.\nPut everything we need in terms of the parameter �:\n�� = ��,\n� = 3�2 + 6�� = 3�2 + 6��1\nPut this in the integral and compute (remember �1 is a constant):\n�1\n� �� = ∫\n3�2 + 6��1 �� = �3 + 3�1\n2�1.\n∫�2\n\n9 POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS\nSo,\n� (�1, �1) - � (0, 0) = ∫�1+�2\n� ⋅ �� = 3�1\n2 + �3\n1 + 3�1\n2�1.\nNow, we are free to choose any value for � (0, 0), i.e. it is an arbitrary constant of integration �. So,\ndropping the subscripts on �1 and �1, we have\n� (�, �) = 3�2 + �3 + 3�2� + �.\nMethod 2 for finding � .\nWe know � = �� and � = ��. We start by integrating � with respect to �.\n�� = 3�2 + 6�� ⇒ � (�, �) = �3 + 3�2� + �(�).\nThe function �(�) is the 'constant of integration' with respect to �.\nNow �� = �, so differentiating our expression for � we get\n�� = 3�2 + � ′(�) = � = 3�2 + 6�.\nThus, � ′(�) = 6�, which implies �(�) = 3�2 + �. Using this in our expression for � , we have\n� (�, �) = �3 + 3�2� + �(�) = 3�2� + 3�2 + �3 + �.\n(Same as method 1.)\n(\n)\nExample GT.23. Let � =\n(� + �2), (2�� + 3�2) . Show that � is a gradient field and find the\npotential function using both methods.\nSolution: Testing the partials we have: �� = 2� = ��, � defined on all (�, �). Thus, by Theorem\nGT.17, � is conservative.\nMethod 1: Use the path shown.\nx\ny\nC1\nC2\nx1\nQ = (x1, y1)\nWe know � (�1, �1) - � (0, 0) = ∫\n� ⋅ �� = ∫ � �� + ∫ � ��,\n�1+�2\n�1\n�2\nParametrize �1: � = �, � = 0, � runs from 0 to �1.\nIn terms of the parameter � along �1: �� = ��,\n� = � + �2 = �.\nIntegrating:\n�1\n�2\n� �� = ∫\n� �� = 2 .\n∫�1\nParametrize �2: � = �1, � = �, � runs from 0 to �1.\nIn terms of the parameter � along �2: �� = ��,\n� = 2�1� + 3�2.\nIntegrating:\n�1\n� �� = ∫\n2�1� + 3�2 �� = �1�2\n1 + �3\n1.\n∫�2\n\n10 GREEN'S THEOREM\n�2\nSo, � (�1, �1) = ∫�1+�2\n� ⋅ �� + � (0, 0) =\n+ �1�2\n1 + �1\n3 + � (0, 0).\nLetting � (0, 0) = � and dropping the subscripts on �1, �1 we have\n�2\n� (�, �) =\n+ ��2 + �3 + �.\nMethod 2. Since, in 18.04, we are less interested in method 2, we'll leave this to the reader.\n10 Green's theorem\nGreen's theorem is the one of the big theorems of multivariable calculus. It relates line integrals\nand area integrals. Using this relation we can often compute a seemingly difficult integral without\nintegration or reduce it to an easy integral. At the this section we will describe how it is analogous\nto the fundamental theorem of calculus.\n10.1 Simple closed curves\nDefinition. A simple closed curve is a closed curve with no self-intersection.\nA simple closed curve � has a well-defined interior. Call the interior �. We say that � is positively\noriented if � is always on the left as you traverse the curve. We call � the boundary of �.\nx\ny\nR\nC\nR\nC\nR\nC\nThree positively oriented simple closed curves bounding a region �\nx\ny\nClosed but not simple\nNote. For smooth curves like the ones shown above the interior is easy to define. For an arbitrary\nsimple closed curves, showing that it has a well-defined interior is more subtle. The theorem that\nproves this is called the Jordan curve theorem.\n10.2 Green's theorem\nTheorem GT.24. Green's theorem. Let � be a positively oriented simple closed curve with interior\nregion �. We assume � is piecewise smooth (a few corners are okay). If the vector field � = (�, �)\nis defined and differentiable on � then\n� �� + � �� = ∫∫�\n�� - �� ��.\n(4)\n∮�\nIn two dimensions we define curl� = �� - ��. So, in vector form, Green's theorem is written\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�\ncurl� ��.\n∮�\n\n10 GREEN'S THEOREM\nExample GT.25. (Using the right hand side of Equation 4 to find the left hand side.)\nUse Green's theorem to compute\n�\n3�2�2 �� + 2�2(1 + ��) ��\n= ∮�\nwhere � is the circle shown.\nx\ny\nC\na\nSolution: The line integral is of the form on the left hand side of Green's theorem. So, by Green's\ntheorem we can convert the line integral to an area integral. In the line integral � = 3�2�2, � =\n2�2(1 + ��), so �� - �� = 6�2� + 4� -6�2� = 4�. Therefore,\n�\n3�2�2 �� + 2�2(1 + ��) �� = ∫∫�\n�� - �� ���� = 4 ∫∫�\n�����.\n= ∮�\nWe could compute this directly, but here's a trick. We know the � center of mass is\n=\n� �� �� = �.\n���\n� ∫∫�\nSince area � = ��2, we have ∫∫�\n� �� �� = ��3, so � = 4��3 .\nExample GT.26. (Using the left hand side of Equation 4 to find the right hand side.)\nUse Green's theorem to find the area under one arch of the cycloid.\nSolution: Our strategy is to use Green's theorem to replace the area integral with a line integral.\nThe figure shows one arch of the cycloid. The region is under the arch and above the �-axis. The\nboundary of the region is � = �1 + �2.\nx\ny\nC1\nC2\nR\n2a\nπa\n2πa\nThe trick is to use the vector field � = (-�, 0), so curl� = �� - �� = 1. With this �, Green's\ntheorem says\n� ⋅ �� = ∮�\n-� �� = ∫∫�\n�� - �� �� = ∫∫�\n�� = area\n∮�\nThat is, the area is equal to the line integral ∮�\n-� ��. We compute the line integral as usual:\n\n10 GREEN'S THEOREM\nParametrize �1: � = �, � = 0, � runs from 0 to 2��. So,\n�� = ��,\n�� = 0,\n� = -� = 0,\n� (skip � because �� = 0).\nThus ∫�1\n� ⋅ �� = 0.\nParametrize �2: � = �(� - sin(�)), � = �(1 - cos(�)), � runs from 2� to 0. (Note the direction �\nruns.) So,\n�� = �(1 - cos(�)) ��,\n�� (skip �� because � = 0),\n� = -� = -�(1 - cos(�)),\n� = 0.\nComputing the integral over �2:\n2�\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�2\n-� �� = ∫\n-�2(1 - cos(�))2 �� = ∫\n�2(1 - cos(�))2 �� = 3��2 .\n∫�2\n2�\n(The integral is easily computed by expanding the square and using the half-angle formula.)\nAdding the two integrals: the area under one arch of the cycloid is 3��2.\n10.3 Other ways to compute area using line integrals\nThe key to the previous example was that for � = (-�, 0) we had curl� = �� - �� = 1. There are\nother vector fields with the property curl� = 1. For example, � = (0, �) or � = (-�∕2, �∕2). Using\nGreen's theorem we have\nArea of � = ∮�\n-� �� ∮�\n� �� =\n-� �� + � ��.\n2 ∮�\nHere � is the positively oriented curve that bounds �.\n10.4 'Proof' of Green's theorem\n(i) First we'll work on the rectangle shown. Later we'll use a lot of rectangles to approximate an\narbitrary region.\nx\ny\na\nb\nc\nd\n(ii) We'll simplify a bit and assume � = 0. The proof when � = 0 is essentially the same with a\nbit more writing.\nFirst we consider the right hand side of Green's theorem (Equation 4). By direct calculation (assum\ning � = 0), the right hand side is\n�\n�\n-��\n-�� �� = ∫\n(�, �) �� ��.\n∫∫�\n� ∫�\n��\n\n10 GREEN'S THEOREM\nThe inner integral is the integral with respect to � of a derivative with respect to �. That is, we can\ncompute it using the fundamental theorem of calculus.\n� �� (�, �) �� = -�(�, �)|� = -�(�, �) + �(�, �)\n�\n∫\n��\n�\nPutting this into the outer integral we have shown that\n�\n-�� �� = ∫\n�(�, �) - �(�, �) ��.\n(5)\n��\n∫∫�\n�\nNext we consider the left hand side of Equation 4. We have (remember � = 0) to compute ∮�\n� ��.\n� has four sides we parametrized each one:\nbottom: � = �, � = �, � runs from � to �, �� = ��\ntop: � = �, � = �, � runs from � to �, �� = ��\nsides: skip because �� = 0.\nSo,\n� �� + ∫���\n� �� (since �� = 0 along the sides)\n∮�\n� �� = ∫������\n�\n�\n�\n= ∫\n�(�, �) �� + ∫\n�(�, �) �� = ∫\n�(�, �) - �(�, �) ��.\n(6)\n�\n�\n�\nComparing Equations 5 and 6 we find that we have proved Green's theorem for the rectangle.\nNext we'll use rectangles to build up an arbitrary region. We start by stacking two rectangles on top\nof each other.\nFor line integrals when adding two rectangles with a common edge the common edges are traversed\nin opposite directions. So, the sum of the line integrals over the two rectangles equals the line integral\nover the outside boundary.\n=\nSimilarly when adding a lot of rectangles: everything cancels except the outside boundary. This\nextends Green's theorem on a rectangle to Green's theorem on a sum of rectangles. Since any region\ncan be approximated as closely as we want by a sum of rectangles, Green's theorem must hold on\narbitrary regions. (See figure below.)\n\n11 ANALOGY TO THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS\n≈\nAny region and boundary can be approximated as a sum of rectangles.\n11 Analogy to the fundamental theorem of calculus\n��\nWe saw in the proof of Green's theorem that at one key step we had to integrate ∫\n��. To do\n��\nthis we literally used the fundamental theorem. There is another way to view this connection. We\nwill be rather informal in describing it, but it can be made formal and has deep and wide-ranging\napplications in math and science.\nTo set up the analogy we recall the fundamental theorem of calculus\n�\n� ′(�) �� = � (�) - � (�)\n∫�\nHere's a picture of the domain of integration:\n�\n�\n�\nNotice that the left hand side of the fundamental theorem involves the integral of the derivative of\n� over a region (interval), and the right hand side is a sum of � itself over the boundary (endpoints)\nof the region.\nLikewise, Green's theorem says\ncurl� �� = ∮�\n� ⋅ ��.\n∫∫�\nThe left hand side involves the integral of a derivative of � (i.e. curl� = �� - ��) over a region,\nand the right hand side is an integral (i.e. a 'sum') of � itself over the boundary of the region. This\nis exactly the same language we used to describe the fundamental theorem of calculus.\n12 Simply connected regions\nWe will need the topological notion of a simply connected region. We will stick with an informal\ndefinition of simply connected that will be sufficient for our purposes.\n\n13 POTENTIAL THEOREM AND CONSERVATIVE FIELDS\n(For those who are interested: We will assume that a simple closed curve has an inside and an outside.\nThis is intuitive and is easy to show if � is a smooth curve, but turns out to surprisingly hard if we\nallow � to be strange, e.g. a Koch snowflake.)\nDefinition: A region � in the plane is called simply connected if, for every simple closed curve\nthat lies entirely in � the interior of � also lies entirely in �.\nExamples:\nD1\nD2\nD3\nx\ny\nD4\nx\ny\nD5 = whole plane\nD1-D5 are simply connected, since for any simple closed curve inside them its interior is entirely\ninside the region. This is sometimes phrased as each region has \"no holes\".\nNote. An alternative definition, which works in higher dimensions is that the region is simply con\nnected if any curve in the region can be continuously shrunk to a point without leaving the region.\nThe regions at below are not simply connected. That is, the interior of the curve � is not entirely in\nthe region.\nC\nAnnulus\nx\ny\nC\nPuntured plane\n13 Potential theorem and conservative fields\nAs an application of Green's theorem we can now give a more complete answer to our question of\nhow to tell if a field is conservative. The theorem does not have a standard name, so we choose to\ncall it the Potential theorem. You should check that it is largely a restatement for simply connected\nregions of Theorem GT.17 above.\nTheorem GT.27. (Potential theorem) Take � = (�, �) defined and differentiable on a region �.\n(a) If � = �� then curl� = �� - �� = 0.\n(b) If � is simply connected and curl� = 0 on �, then � = �� for some � .\nNotes.\n1. We know that on a connected region, being a gradient field is equivalent to being conservative. So\nwe can restate the Potential theorem as: On a simply connected region, � is conservative is equivalent\nto curl� = 0.\n\n13 POTENTIAL THEOREM AND CONSERVATIVE FIELDS\n2. Recall that once we know work integral is path independent, we can compute the potential function\n� by picking a base point �0 in � and letting\n� (�) = ∫�\n� ⋅ ��,\nwhere � is any path in � from �0 to �.\nProof of (a): This was proved in Theorem GT.17.\nProof of (b): Suppose � is a simple closed curve in �. Since � is simply connected the interior\nof � is also in �. Therefore, using Green's theorem we have,\n� ⋅ ��\ncurl� �� = 0.\n∮�\n= ∫∫�\nx\ny\nD\nC\nR\nThis shows that � is conservative in �. Therefore by Theorem GT.14, � is a gradient field.\nSummary: Suppose the vector field � = (�, �) is defined on a simply connected region �. Then,\nthe following statements are equivalent.\n�\n(1) ∫\n� ⋅ �� is path independent.\n�\n(2) ∮�\n� ⋅ �� = 0 for any closed path �.\n(3) � = �� for some � in �\n(4) � is conservative in �.\nIf � is continuously differentiable then 1, 2, 3, 4 all imply 5:\n(5) curl� = �� - �� = 0 in �\n13.1 Why we need simply connected in the Potential theorem\nThe basic idea is that if there is a hole in �, then � might not be defined on the interior of �. This\nis illustrated in the next example.\nExample GT.28.(What can go wrong if � is not simply connected.) Here we will repeat the super-\nduper really important Example GT.9.\n(-�, �)\nLet � =\n(\"tangential field\").\n�2\n� is defined on � = plane - (0,0) = punctured plane\n\n14 EXTENDED GREEN'S THEOREM\nx\ny\nC\nPuntured plane\nSeveral times now we have shown that curl� = 0. (If you've forgotten this, you should recompute it\nnow.) We also know that on any circle � of radius � centered at the origin ∫�\n� ⋅ �� = 2�.\nSo, the conclusion of the above theorem that curl� = 0 implies � is conservative does not hold. The\nproblem is that � is not simply connected and, in fact, � is not defined on the entire region inside �,\nso we are not able to apply Green's theorem to conclude that the line integral is 0.\n14 Extended Green's theorem\nWe can extend Green's theorem to a region � which has multiple boundary curves. The figures\nbelow show regions bounded by 2 or more curves. You will see that this gives us away to work\naround singularities in the field �.\n14.1 Regions with multiple boundary curves\nConsider the following three regions.\nC1\nC2\nRA\nC3\nC4\nC5\nC6\nRB\nC7\nC8\nRC\nThe region on the left, �� is bounded by �1 and �2. We say that the boundary is �1 + �2. Note that\nthe way it is drawn, the region is always to the left as you traverse either boundary curve.\nThe region on the right, �� is bounded by �7 and �8. We say that the boundary is �7 - �8. The\nreason for the minus sign is that the boundary curves should be oriented so that the region is to your\nleft as you traverse the curve. As shown, the region �� is to the right of �8, but to the left of -�8.\nLikewise, in the middle figure, �� has boundary �3 + �4 + �5 + �6. You should check that our\nsigns are consistent with the orientation of the curves.\n\n14 EXTENDED GREEN'S THEOREM\n14.2 Extended Green's theorem\nTheorem GT.29. Extended Green's theorem. Suppose �� is the region in the left-hand figure above\nthen, for any vector field � differentiable in all of �� we have\ncurl� �� ��.\n∮�1+�2\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫��\nLikewise for more than two curves: If �� has boundary �3 + �4 + �5 + �6 and � is differentiable\non all of �� then\ncurl� �� ��.\n∮�3+�4+�5+�6\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫��\nProof. We will prove the formula for ��. The case of more than two curves is essentially the same.\nThe key is to make the 'cut' shown in the figure below, so that the resulting curve is simple.\nC1\nC2\nC3\n-C3\nRA\nIn the figure the curve �1 + �3 + �2 - �3 surrounds the region ��. (You have to imagine that the\ncut is infinitesimally wide so �3 and -�3 are right on top of each other.)\nNow the original Green's theorem applies:\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�\ncurl� �� ��\n∮�1+�3+�2-�3\nSince the contributions of �3 and -�3 will cancel, we have proved the extended form of Green's\ntheorem.\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�\ncurl� �� ��.\nQED\n∮�1+�2\n(-�, �)\nExample GT.30. Again, let � be the tangential field � =\n. What values can ∮�\n� ⋅ �� take\n�2\nfor � a simple closed positively oriented curve that doesn't go through the origin?\nSolution: We have two cases (i) �1 does not go around 0; (ii) �2 goes around 0\nC1\nR1\nC2\nR2\nx\ny\n\n14 EXTENDED GREEN'S THEOREM\nCase (i) We know � is defined and curl� = 0 in the entire region inside �1, so Green's theorem\nimplies\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�\ncurl� �� �� = 0.\n∮�1\nCase (ii) We can't apply Green's theorem directly because � is not defined everywhere inside �2.\nInstead, we use the following trick. Let �3 be a circle centered on the origin and small enough that\nis entirely inside �2.\nx\ny\nC2\nC3\nR2\nThe region �2 has boundary �2 - �3 and � is defined and differentiable in �2. We know that\ncurl� = 0 in �2, so extended Green's theorem implies\ncurl� �� �� = 0.\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�2\n∫�2-�3\n� ⋅ ��.\nSo ∫�2\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�3\nSince �3 is a circle centered on the origin we can compute the line integral directly -we've done this\nmany times already.\n� ⋅ �� = 2�.\n∮�3\nTherefore, for a simple closed curve � and � as given, the line integral ∮�\n� ⋅ �� is either 2� or 0,\ndepending on whether � surrounds the origin or not.\nAnswer to the question: The only possible values are 0 and 2�.\nExample GT.31. Use the same � as in the previous example. What values can the line integral take\nif � is not simple.\nSolution: If � is not simple we can break it into a sum of simple curves.\nx\ny\nC1\nC2\n\n15 ONE MORE EXAMPLE\nIn the figure, we can think of the entire curve as �1 + �2. Since each of these curves surrounds the\norigin we have\n� ⋅ �� = 2� + 2� = 4�.\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�1\n� ⋅ �� + ∫�2\n∫�1+�2\nIn general, ∮�\n� ⋅ �� = 2��, where � is the number of times � goes around (0,0) in a counterclock\nwise direction.\nAside for those who are interested: The integer � is called the winding number of � around 0. The\nnumber � also equals the number of times � crosses the positive �-axis, counting +1 if it crosses\nfrom below to above and -1 if it crosses from above to below.\n15 One more example\nExample GT.32. Let � = �� (�, �) .\nFor � ≥ 0, � is defined on the entire plane. For � < 0, � is defined on the ��-plane minus the origin\n(the punctured plane).\nUse extended Green's theorem to show that � is conservative on the punctured plane for all integers\n�. Then, find a potential function.\nSolution: We start by computing the curl:\n� = ��� ⇒ �� = ���-2��\n� = ��� ⇒ �� = ���-2��\nSo, curl� = �� - �� = 0.\nTo show that � is conservative in the punctured plane, we will show that ∫�\n� ⋅ �� = 0 for all simple\nclosed curves � that don't go through the origin.\nIf � is a simple closed curve not around 0 then � is differentiable on the entire region inside � and\nGreen's theorem implies ∫�\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�\ncurl� �� �� = 0.\nIf � is a simple closed curve that surrounds 0, then we can use the extended form of Green's theorem\nas in Example GT.30\nx\ny\nC\nC2\nR\nWe put a small circle �2 centered at the origin and inside �.\n\n||||\n||||\n15 ONE MORE EXAMPLE\nSince � is radial, it is orthogonal to �2. So, on �2, � ⋅ �� = 0, which implies ∮�2\n� ⋅ �� = 0. Now,\non the region � with boundary � - �2 we can apply the extended Green's theorem\n� ⋅ �� = ∫∫�\ncurl� �� �� = 0.\n∮�-�2\nThus, ∮�\n� ⋅ �� = ∮�2\n� ⋅ ��, which, as we saw, equals 0.\nThus ∮�\n� ⋅ �� = 0 for all closed loops, which implies � is conservative. QED\nTo find the potential function we use method 1 over the curve � = �1 + �2 shown.\nx\ny\nC1\nC2\n(x1, y1)\n(1, 1)\nThe following calculation works for � = -2. For � = -2 everything is the same except we get\nnatural logs instead of powers.\nParametrize �1 using �: � = 0, � = �; � from 1 to �1. So,\n�� = 0,\n�� = ��,\nskip �, since �� = 0,\n� = ��� = �(1 + �2)�∕2. So,\n�1\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�1\n� �� + � �� = ∫\n�(1 + �2)�∕2 ��\n∫�1\n(1 + �2)(�+2)∕2 �1\n=\n(�-substitution: � = 1 + �2)\n� + 2\n|1\n(1 + �2)(�+2)∕2\n- 2(�+2)∕2\n=\n.\n� + 2\n� + 2\nParametrize �2 using �: � = �, � = �1; � from 1 to �1. So,\n= ��� = �(�2 + �2\n1)�∕2\n�� = ��,\n�� = 0,\n�\nskip, � since �� = 0. So,\n�1\n� ⋅ �� = ∫�2\n� �� + � �� = ∫\n�(�2 + �2\n1)�∕2 ��\n∫�2\n)(�+2)∕2\n(�2 + �2\n�1\n=\n(�-substitution: � = �2 + �2)\n� + 2\n|1\n)(�+2)∕2\n)(�+2)∕2\n(�2 + �2\n(1 + �2\n=\n-\n.\n� + 2\n� + 2\n)(�+2)∕2 - 2(�+2)∕2\n(�2 + �2\nAdding these we get � (�1, �1) - � (1, 1) =\n. So,\n� + 2\n��+2\n� (�, �) =\n+ �.\n(If � = -2 we get � (�, �) = ln � + �.)\n� + 2\n\n15 ONE MORE EXAMPLE\n(Note, we ignored the fact that if (�1, �1) is on the negative �-axis we shoud have used a different\npath that doesn't go through the origin. This isn't really an issue because we know there is a potential\nfunction. Because our function � is known to be a potential function everywhere except the negative\n�-axis, by continuity it also works on the negative �-axis.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

This is an essential step in using the Laplace transform to solve differential equa\ntions, and this was more or less Heaviside's original motivation.\nThe cover-up method can be used to make a partial fractions decomposition of a proper rational\nfunction � (�) whenever the denominator can be factored into distinct linear factors. We will see\n�(�)\nthat we can extend the coverup method to also deal with distinct quadratic factors.\nNote. We put this section first, because the coverup method is so useful and many people have not\nseen it. Some of the later examples rely on the full algebraic method of undetermined coefficients\npresented in the next section. If you have never seen partial fractions you should read that section\nfirst.\n1.1.2 Linear Factors\nWe first show how the method works on a simple example, and then show why it works.\n� -7\nExample PF.1. Decompose\ninto partial fractions.\n(� - 1)(� + 2)\nSolution: We know the answer will have the form\n� -7\n�\n�\n=\n+\n(1)\n(� - 1)(� + 2)\n� -1\n� + 2.\nTo determine � by the cover-up method, on the left-hand side we mentally remove (or cover up with\na finger) the factor � -1 associated with �, and substitute � = 1 into what's left; this gives �:\n|\n� -7\n1 -7\n=\n= -2 = �.\n(2)\n(� + 2)\n1 + 2\n|�=1\nSimilarly, � is found by covering up the factor � + 2 on the left, and substituting � = -2 into what's\nleft. This gives\n� -7\n-2 -7\n=\n= 3 = �.\n(� - 1)\n||�=-2\n-2 -1\nThus, our answer is\n� -7\n-2\n=\n+\n(3)\n(� - 1)(� + 2)\n� -1\n� + 2.\n\n1 PARTIAL FRACTIONS AND THE COVERUP METHOD\n1.1.3 Why does the method work?\nThe reason is simple. The \"right\" way to determine � from Equation 1 would be to multiply both\nsides by (� - 1); this would give\n� -7\n�\n= � +\n(� - 1).\n(4)\n(� + 2)\n� + 2\nNow if we substitute � = 1, what we get is exactly Equation 2, since the term on the right with �\ndisappears. The cover-up method therefore is just an easy and efficient way of doing the calculations.\nIn general, if the denominator of the proper rational function factors into the product of distinct linear\nfactors:\n� (�)\n�1\n��\n=\n+ ... +\n,\n�� = �� ,\n(� - �1)(� - �2) ⋯ (� - ��)\n� - �1\n� - ��\nthen �� is found by covering up the factor � - �� on the left, and setting � = �� in the rest of the\nexpression.\nExample PF.2. Decompose\ninto partial fractions.\n�3 - �\nSolution: Factoring, �3 - � = �(�2 -1) = �(� - 1)(� + 1). By the cover-up method,\n-1\n1∕2\n1∕2\n=\n+\n+\n�(� - 1)(� + 1)\n�\n� -1\n� + 1.\nTo be honest, the real difficulty in all of the partial fractions methods (the cover-up method being no\nexception) is in factoring the denominator.\n1.1.4 Quadratic Factors\nThere are multiple ways to deal with a quadratic factors that don't have real roots.\n1. Factor the quadratic factor into complex linear factors.\n2. Use 'complex coverup'\n3. Use a algebraic techniques with just real numbers\nWe will show all three methods using the same example\n� -1\nExample PF.3. Decompose �(�) =\nby factoring the denominator into complex\n(� + 1)(�2 + 4)\nlinear terms\n� -1\n� -1\n�\n�\n�\nSolution:\n=\n=\n+\n+\n.\n(� + 1)(�2 + 4)\n(� + 1)(� -2�)(� + 2�)\n� + 1\n� -2�\n� + 2�\n2� -1\n4 -3�\n4 + 3�\nUsing coverup we see that � = -2∕5, � =\n=\n, � =\n. So,\n(2� + 1)(4�)\n-2∕5\n(4 -3�)∕20\n(4 + 3�)∕20\n-2∕5\n(8� + 12)∕20\n-2∕5\n(2�∕5 + 3∕5)\n�(�) =\n+\n+\n=\n+\n=\n+\n.\n� + 1\n� -2�\n� + 2�\n� + 1\n�2 + 4\n� + 1\n�2 + 4\n� -1\nExample PF.4. Decompose �(�) =\nwithout using complex techniques.\n(� + 1)(�2 + 4)\n\n1 PARTIAL FRACTIONS AND THE COVERUP METHOD\nSolution: Notice that in the previous example in the last expression for �(�) the numerator of the\n�2 + 4 term in the partial fraction decomposition is a linear term instead of a constant. This is the\ngeneral rule for quadratic terms.\n� -1\n�\n�� + �\n=\n+\n.\n(5)\n(� + 1)(�2 + 4)\n� + 1\n�2 + 4\nNotice the quadratic factor gets a linear term in the numerator. Notice also that the number of un\nknown coefficients is the same as the degree of the denominator in the original fraction.\nUsing coverup we find � = -2∕5. Now we can do some algebra to find � and �. Muliplying\nEquation 5 through by the denominator gives\n� -1 = �(�2 + 4) + (�� + �)(� + 1) = (� + �)�2 + (� + �)� + (4� + �).\nEquate the coefficients on both sides:\n�2 ∶ 0 = � + �\n� ∶ 1 = � + �\n�2 ∶\n-1 = 4� + �\nSince we already know �, the first equation gives � = 2∕5, and then the second gives � = 3∕5.\nComparing this with the previous example we see we've found the same answer.\n� -1\nExample PF.5. Decompose\nusing 'complex coverup'.\n(� + 1)(�2 + 4)\nSolution: This starts the same as the previous example.\n� -1\n�\n�� + �\n=\n+\n.\n(6)\n(� + 1)(�2 + 4)\n� + 1\n�2 + 4\nCoverup gives us � = -2∕5. To do complex coverup, mentally multiply the above equation by\n�2 + 4 and then substitute � = 2�. We get\n2� -1\n3 + 4�\n= �(2�) + � ⇔\n= � + 2��.\n2� + 1\nSo, � = 3∕5 and � = 2∕5. (Same as before.)\nExample PF.6. Don't be fooled by quadratic terms that factor into linear ones.\n�\n�\n�\n=\n=\n+\n+\n(� + 1)(�2 -4)\n(� + 1)(� + 2)(� - 2)\n� + 1\n� + 2\n� -2.\nExample PF.7. Don't forget that the rational function must be proper. For example, decompose\n�3 + 2� + 1 using partial fractions.\n�2 + � -2\nSolution: First, we must use long-division to make this proper.\n�3 + 2� + 1\n5� -1\n5� -1\n�\n�\n= � -1 +\n= � -1 +\n= � -1 +\n+\n�2 + � -2\n�2 + � -2\n(� + 2)(� - 1)\n� + 2\n� -1.\nUsing coverup we get � = 11∕3, � = 4∕3.\n\n1 PARTIAL FRACTIONS AND THE COVERUP METHOD\n1.1.5 Repeated Linear Factors\nThe cover-up method can also be used if a linear factor is repeated, but it gives just partial results.\nIt applies only to the highest power of the linear factor.\nExample PF.8. Decompose\n.\n(� - 1)2(� + 2)\nSolution: We write\n�\n�\n�\n=\n+\n+\n(7)\n(� - 1)2(� + 2)\n(� - 1)2\n� -1\n� + 2.\nTo find � cover up (� - 1)2 and set � = 1; you get � = 1∕3. To find �, cover up � + 2, and set\n� = -2; you get � = 1∕9.\nThis leaves � which cannot be found by the cover-up method. But since � and � are already known\nin Equation 7, � can be found by substituting any numerical value (other than 1 or -2) for � in (7).\nFor instance, if we put � = 0 and remember that � = 1∕3 and � = 1∕9, we get\n1∕3\n�\n1∕9\n=\n+\n+\n,\n-1\ngiving � = -1∕9.\n� could also be found by applying the method of undetermined coefficients to the Equation 7; note\nthat since � and � are known, it is enough to get a single linear equation in order to determine � --\nsimultaneous equations are no longer needed.\nThe fact that the cover-up method works for just the highest power of the repeated linear factor can\nbe seen just as before. In the above example for instance, the cover-up method for finding � is just a\nshort way of multiplying Equation 9 through by (�-1)2 and then substituting � = 1 into the resulting\nequation.\n1.2 Partial Fractions: Undetermined Coefficients\n1.2.1 Introduction\nLogically this section should precede the previous one on coverup since it explains what we are\ndoing with partial fractions and shows an algebraic method that never fails. However, since most\nstudents in this course will have seen partial fractions before it seemed reasonable to start with the\ncoverup method.\n1.2.2 Rational Functions\nA rational function is one that is the ratio of two polynomials. For example\n� + 1\n�2 + 7� + 9\nand\n�2 + 7� + 9\n� + 1\nare both rational functions.\nA rational function is called proper if the degree of the numerator is strictly smaller than the degree\nof the denominator; in the examples above, the first is proper while the second is not.\n\n1 PARTIAL FRACTIONS AND THE COVERUP METHOD\nLong-division: Using long-division we can always write an improper rational function as a poly\nnomial plus a proper rational function. The partial fraction decomposition only applies to proper\nfunctions.\nExample PF.9. Use long-division to write �3 + 2� + 1 as the sum of a polynomial and a proper\n�2 + � -2\nrational function.\nSolution:\n� -1\n�2 + � -2\n�3\n+\n2�\n+1\n�3\n+�2\n-2�\n-�2\n+4�\n+1\n-�2\n-�\n+2\n5�\n-1\nTherefore,\n�3 + 2� + 1\n5� -1\n= � -1 +\n.\n�2 + � -2\n�2 + � -2\n1.2.3 Linear Factors\nHere we assume the denominator factors into distinct linear factors. We start with a simple example.\nWe will explain the general principle immediately afterwords.\n� -3\nExample PF.10. Decompose �(�) =\nusing partial fractions.\n(� - 2)(� - 1)\nSolution:\n� -3\n�\n�\n=\n+\n(� - 2)(� - 1)\n� -2\n� -1.\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator on the left gives\n� -3 = �(� - 1) + �(� - 2)\n(8)\nThe sure algebraic way is to expand out the right hand side and equate the coefficients with those of\nthe polynomial on the left.\n{ coeff. of �:\n= � + �\n� -3 = (� + �)� + (-� -2�) ⇒\ncoeff. of 1:\n-3 = -� -2�\nWe solve this system of equations to find the undetermined coefficients � and �: � = -1, � = 2.\nAnswer: �(�) = -1∕(� - 2) + 2∕(� - 1).\nNote. Not surprisingly, using the coverup method by plugging the roots of each factor into Equation\n8 would be easier because when you do this every term except one becomes 0.\nPlug in � = 1\n⇒ -2 = �(-1) ⇒ � = 2\nPlug in � = 2\n⇒ -1 = �(1) ⇒ � = -1.\nIn general, if � (�)∕�(�) is a proper rational function and �(�) factors into distinct linear factors\n�(�) = (� - �1)(� - �2) ⋯ (� - ��) then\n� (�)\n�1\n�2\n��\n=\n+\n+ ⋯ +\n.\n�(�)\n� - �1\n� - �2\n� - ��\n\n1 PARTIAL FRACTIONS AND THE COVERUP METHOD\nThe proof of this is not hard, but we will not give it. Remember you must have a proper rational\nfunction and each of the factors must be distinct. Repeated factors are discussed below.\nExample PF.11. Decompose\n.\n�3 -3�2 - � + 3\nSolution: The hardest part of this problem is to factor the denominator. For higher order polynomials\nthis might be impossible. In this case you can check\n�3 -3�2 - � + 3 = (� - 1)(� + 1)(� - 3).\nThe partial fractions decomposition is\n�\n�\n�\n=\n+\n+\n(� - 1)(� + 1)(� - 3)\n� -1\n� + 1\n� -3.\nMultiplying through by the denominator gives\n3 = �(� + 1)(� - 3) + �(� - 1)(� - 3) + �(� - 1)(� + 1).\nPlugging in � = 1 gives � = -3∕4, likewise � = -1 gives � = 3∕2 and � = 3 gives � = -3∕4.\n1.2.4 Quadratic Factors\n5� + 6\nExample PF.12. Decompose\n.\n(�2 + 4)(� - 2)\nSolution: We write\n5� + 6\n�� + �\n�\n=\n+\n(9)\n(�2 + 4)(� - 2)\n�2 + 4\n� -2.\nWe first determine � by the cover-up method, getting � = 2 . Then � and � can be found by the\nmethod of undetermined coefficients; the work is greatly reduced since we need to solve only two\nsimultaneous equations to find � and �, not three.\nFollowing this plan, using � = 2, we combine terms on the right of (9) so that both sides have the\nsame denominator. The numerators must then also be equal, which gives us\n5� + 6 = (�� + �)(� - 2) + 2(�2 + 4).\n(10)\nComparing the coefficients of �2 and of the constant terms on both sides of (10) gives the two equa\ntions\n0 = � + 2\nand\n6 = -2� + 8,\nfrom which � = -2 and � = 1 .\nIn using Equation 10, one could have instead compared the coefficients of �, getting 5 = -2� + �,\nleading to the same result, but providing a valuable check on the correctness of the computed values\nfor � and �.\nIn Example PF.12, an alternative to undetermined coefficients would be to substitute two numerical\nvalues for � into the original Equation 9, say � = 0 and � = 1 (any values other than � = 2 are\nusable). Again one gets two simultaneous equations for � and �. This method requires addition of\nfractions, and is usually better when only one coefficient remains to be determined (as in the example\njust below).\n\n1 PARTIAL FRACTIONS AND THE COVERUP METHOD\n1.2.5 Repeated Linear Factors\nFor repeated linear factors we need one partial fraction term for each power of the factor as illustrated\nby the following example.\nExample PF.13. Decompose �(�) =\n2�\nusing partial fractions.\n�3(� + 1)2(� + 2)\nSolution:\n2�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�(�) =\n=\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n�3(� + 1)2(� + 2)\n�\n�2\n�3\n� + 1\n(� + 1)2\n� + 2\nHere the denominator has a linear factor � repeated three times (term �3), and a linear factor (� + 1)\nrepeated twice (term (� + 1)2); hence three partial fractions are associated with the first, while two\nare associated with the latter. The term (s+2) which is not repeated leads to one partial fraction as\npreviously seen. You can check that the coefficients are\n� = -5∕2, � = 1, � = 0, � = 2, � = 2, � = 1∕2.\n1.2.6 Repeated Quadratic Factors\nJust like repeated linear factors, quadratic factors have one term for each power of the factor as\nillustrated in the following example.\nExample PF.14. Find �(�) =\n2�\nusing partial fractions.\n�(�2 + 1)2(�2 + 4� + 2)\nSolution: The partial fractions decomposition is\n2�\n�\n�� + �\n�� + �\n�� + �\n�(�) =\n=\n+\n+\n+\n�(�2 + 1)2(�2 + 4� + 6)\n�\n�2 + 1\n(�2 + 1)2\n�2 + 4� + 6\nNote the repeated factor (�2 + 1)2 lead to two partial fraction terms.\nWe won't compute the coefficients -you can do this by going through the algebra.\n1.2.7 Complex Factors\nAs in Example PF.3 we can allow complex roots. In this case all quadratic terms factor into linear\nterms.\nExample PF.15. Decompose �∕(�2 + �2) using complex partial fractions.\nSolution:\n�\n�\n�\n�\n=\n=\n+\n.\n�2 + �2\n(� - ��)(� + ��)\n� - ��\n� + ��\nMultiplying through by the denominator gives � = �(� + ��) + �(� - ��).\nPlug in � = �� ⇒ � = 1∕2.\nPlug in � = -�� ⇒ � = 1∕2.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Show that � is a constant.\nAnswer. Since |� (�)| > 1 we know � is never 0. Therefore 1∕� (�) is entire and |1∕� (�)| < 1.\nBeing entire and bounded it is constant by Liouville's theorem.\nProblem 7.\nSuppose � (�) is analytic and |� | is constant on the disk |� - �0| ≤ �. Show that � is constant on the\ndisk.\nAnswer. This follows from the maximum modulus principle. Since |� | is constant on the disk, its\nmaximum modulus does not occur only on the boundary. Therefore it must be constant.\nExtra problems from pset 4\nProblem 8. (a) Let � (�) = ecos(�)�2. Let � be the disk |� -5| ≤ 2. Show that � (�) attains both its\nmaximum and minimum modulus in � on the circle |� -5| = 2.\nHint: Consider 1∕� (�).\nSolution: Since � (�) is analytic on and inside the disk, the maximum modulus principle tells us it\nattains its maximum modulus on the boundary.\nSince e� is never 0 and �2 is not zero anywhere in � we know that 1∕� (�) is analytic on and inside\nthe disk. Therefore it attains its maximum modulus on the boundary. But the point where 1∕|� (�)|\nis maximized is the point where |� (�)| is minimized.\n(b) Suppose � (�) is entire. Show that if � (4)(�) is bounded in the whole plane then � (�) is a polyno\nmial of degree at most 4.\nSolution: By the maximum modulus principle � (4)(�) is a constant. Integrating a constant 4 times\nleads to a polynomial of degree a most 4.\n(c) The function � (�) = 1∕�2 goes to 0 as � → inf, but it is not constant. Does this contradict\nLiouville's theorem?\nSolution: No, Liouville's theorem requires the function be entire. � (�) has a singularity at the origin,\nso it is not entire.\nProblem 9.\n�\nShow ∫\necos � cos(sin(�)) �� = �. Hint, consider e�∕� over the unit circle.\nSolution: (Follow the hint.) Parametrize the unit circle as �(�) = e��, with 0 ≤ � ≤ 2�.

But, by symmetry ours is half the above.\n(It might be easier to see this if you use the limits [-�, �] instead of [0, 2�].)\nSo, we have shown that the integral is �.\nProblem 10.\n(a) Suppose � (�) is analytic on a simply connected region � and � is a simple closed curve in �..\nFix �0 in �, but not on �. Use the Cauchy integral formulas to show that\n� ′(�)\n� (�)\n�� = ∫�\n��.\n∫� � - �0\n(� - �0)2\n′\nSince � is simply connected we know � and � are analytic on and inside �.

Since �(�) goes to 0 as |�| gets large we can\npick � large enough that |�(�)| < |�(�0)| for all |�| = �. But this violates the maximum modulus\ntheorem, which says that the maximum modulus of �(�) on the disk |�| ≤ � occurs on the circle\n|�| = �. This disaster means our assumption that �(�) = 0 was wrong. We conclude �(�) ≡ 0 as\nclaimed.\nThis means that � (�) = � (�0) for all �, i.e. � (�) is constant.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

He deserves most of\nthe credit for the course design. The topic notes were written by me with many corrections and\nimprovements contributed by Jorn Dunkel. Of course, any responsibility for typos and errors lies\nentirely with me.\n0.1 Brief course description\nComplex analysis is a beautiful, tightly integrated subject. It revolves around complex analytic func\ntions. These are functions that have a complex derivative. Unlike calculus using real variables, the\nmere existence of a complex derivative has strong implications for the properties of the function.\nComplex analysis is a basic tool in many mathematical theories. By itself and through some of these\ntheories it also has a great many practical applications.\nThere are a small number of far-reaching theorems that we'll explore in the first part of the class.\nAlong the way, we'll touch on some mathematical and engineering applications of these theorems.\nThe last third of the class will be devoted to a deeper look at applications.\nThe main theorems are Cauchy's Theorem, Cauchy's integral formula, and the existence of Taylor\nand Laurent series. Among the applications will be harmonic functions, two dimensional fluid flow,\neasy methods for computing (seemingly) hard integrals, Laplace transforms, and Fourier transforms\nwith applications to engineering and physics.\n0.2 Topics needed from prerequisite math classes\nWe will review these topics as we need them:\n- Limits\n- Power series\n- Vector fields\n- Line integrals\n- Green's theorem\n0.3 Level of mathematical rigor\nWe will make careful arguments to justify our results. Though, in many places we will allow our\nselves to skip some technical details if they get in the way of understanding the main point, but we\nwill note what was left out.\n\n0 18.04 COURSE INTRODUCTION\n0.4 Speed of the class\n(Borrowed from R. Rosales 18.04 OCW 1999)\nDo not be fooled by the fact things start slow. This is the kind of course where things keep on building\nup continuously, with new things appearing rather often. Nothing is really very hard, but the total\nintegration can be staggering - and it will sneak up on you if you do not watch it. Or, to express it in\nmathematically sounding lingo, this course is \"locally easy\" but \"globally hard\". That means that if\nyou keep up-to-date with the homework and lectures, and read the class notes regularly, you should\nnot have any problems.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Topic 1 Notes\nJeremy Orloff\n1 Complex algebra and the complex plane\nWe will start with a review of the basic algebra and geometry of complex numbers. Most likely you\nhave encountered this previously in 18.03 or elsewhere.\n1.1 Motivation\nThe equation �2 = -1 has no real solutions, yet we know that this equation arises naturally and we\nwant to use its roots. So we make up a new symbol for the roots and call it a complex number.\nDefinition. The symbols ±� will stand for the solutions to the equation �2 = -1. We will call these\nnew numbers complex numbers. We will also write\n√\n-1 = ±�\nNote: Engineers typically use � while mathematicians and physicists use �. We'll follow the mathe\nmatical custom in 18.04.\nThe number � is called an imaginary number. This is a historical term. These are perfectly valid\nnumbers that don't happen to lie on the real number line.1 We're going to look at the algebra,\ngeometry and, most important for us, the exponentiation of complex numbers.\nBefore starting a systematic exposition of complex numbers, we'll work a simple example.\nExample 1.1. Solve the equation �2 + � + 1 = 0.\nSolution: We can apply the quadratic formula to get\n√\n√\n√√\n√\n-1 ±\n1 -4\n-1 ±\n-3\n-1 ±\n-1\n-1 ±\n3 �\n� =\n=\n=\n=\n.\nThink: Do you know how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square? This is how the\nquadratic formula is derived and is well worth knowing!\n1.2 Fundamental theorem of algebra\nOne of the reasons for using complex numbers is because allowing complex roots means every\npolynomial has exactly the expected number of roots. This is called the fundamental theorem of\nalgebra.\nTheorem. (Fundamental theorem of algebra) A polynomial of degree � has exactly � complex\nroots (repeated roots are counted with multiplicity).\n1Our motivation for using complex numbers is not the same as the historical motivation. Historically, mathematicians\nwere willing to say �2 = -1 had no solutions. The issue that pushed them to accept complex numbers had to do with\nthe formula for the roots of cubics. Cubics always have at least one real root, and when square roots of negative numbers\nappeared in this formula, even for the real roots, mathematicians were forced to take a closer look at these (seemingly)\nexotic objects.\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nIn a few weeks, we will be able to prove this theorem as a remarkably simple consequence of one of\nour main theorems.\n1.3 Terminology and basic arithmetic\nDefinitions\n- Complex numbers are defined as the set of all numbers\n� = � + ��,\nwhere � and � are real numbers.\n- We denote the set of all complex numbers by �. (On the blackboard we will usually write C\n-this font is called blackboard bold.)\n- We call � the real part of �. This is denoted by � = Re(�).\n- We call � the imaginary part of �. This is denoted by � = Im(�).\nImportant: The imaginary part of � is a real number. It does not include the �.\nThe basic arithmetic operations follow the standard rules. All you have to remember is that �2 = -1.\nWe will go through these quickly using some simple examples. It almost goes without saying that\nin 18.04 it is essential that you become fluent with these manipulations.\n- Addition: (3 + 4�) + (7 + 11�) = 10 + 15�\n- Subtraction: (3 + 4�) - (7 + 11�) = -4 -7�\n- Multiplication:\n(3 + 4�)(7 + 11�) = 21 + 28� + 33� + 44�2 = -23 + 61�.\nHere we have used the fact that 44�2 = -44.\nBefore talking about division and absolute value we introduce a new operation called conjugation.\nIt will prove useful to have a name and symbol for this, since we will use it frequently.\nComplex conjugation is denoted with a bar and defined by\n� + �� = � - ��.\nIf � = � + �� then its conjugate is � = � - �� and we read this as \"z-bar = � - ��\".\nExample 1.2.\n3 + 5� = 3 -5�.\nThe following is a very useful property of conjugation: If � = � + �� then\n�� = (� + ��)(� - ��) = �2 + �2 .\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nNote that �� is real. We will use this property in the next example to help with division.\nExample 1.3. (Division.) Write 3 + 4� in the standard form � + ��.\n1 + 2�\nSolution: We use the useful property of conjugation to clear the denominator:\n3 + 4�\n3 + 4� 1 -2�\n11 - 2�\n11 - 2\n=\n⋅\n=\n=\n�.\n1 + 2�\n1 + 2� 1 -2�\nIn the next section we will discuss the geometry of complex numbers, which gives some insight into\nthe meaning of the magnitude of a complex number. For now we just give the definition.\nDefinition. The magnitude of the complex number � + �� is defined as\n√\n|�| =\n�2 + �2.\nThe magnitude is also called the absolute value, norm or modulus.\n√\n√\nExample 1.4. The norm of 3 + 5� =\n9 + 25 =\n34.\nImportant. The norm is the sum of �2 and �2. It does not include the � and is therefore always\npositive.\n1.4 The complex plane\n1.4.1 The geometry of complex numbers\nBecause it takes two numbers � and � to describe the complex number � = � + �� we can visualize\ncomplex numbers as points in the ��-plane. When we do this we call it the complex plane. Since �\nis the real part of � we call the �-axis the real axis. Likewise, the �-axis is the imaginary axis.\nImaginary axis\n�\n�\n�\n�\nImaginary axis\n� = � + �� = (�, �)\n� = � + �� = (�, �)\n�\nReal axis\n�\nReal axis\n-�\n�\n� = � - �� = (�, -�)\n1.4.2 The triangle inequality\nThe triangle inequality says that for a triangle the sum of the lengths of any two legs is greater than\nthe length of the third leg.\n�\n�\n�\nTriangle inequality: |��| + |��| > |��|\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nFor complex numbers the triangle inequality translates to a statement about complex magnitudes.\nPrecisely: for complex numbers �1, �2\n|�1| + |�2| ≥ |�1 + �2|\nwith equality only if one of them is 0 or if arg(�1) = arg(�2). This is illustrated in the following\nfigure.\n�\n�1 + �2\n�2\n�1\n�\nTriangle inequality: |�1| + |�2| ≥ |�1 + �2|\nWe get equality only if �1 and �2 are on the same ray from the origin, i.e. they have the same\nargument.\n1.5 Polar coordinates\nIn the figures above we have marked the length � and polar angle � of the vector from the origin to\nthe point � = � + ��. These are the same polar coordinates you saw in 18.02 and 18.03. There are a\nnumber of synonyms for both � and �\n� = |�| = magnitude = length = norm = absolute value = modulus\n� = arg(�) = argument of � = polar angle of �\nAs in 18.02 you should be able to visualize polar coordinates by thinking about the distance � from\nthe origin and the angle � with the �-axis.\nExample 1.5. Let's make a table of �, � and � for some complex numbers. Notice that � is not\nuniquely defined since we can always add a multiple of 2� to � and still be at the same point in the\nplane.\n� = � + �� �\n�\n0, 2�, 4�, ...\nArgument = 0, means � is along the �-axis\n�\n√1\n�∕2, �∕2 + 2� ... Argument = �∕2, means � is along the �-axis\n1 + �\n2 �∕4, �∕4 + 2� ... Argument = �∕4, means � is along the ray at 45* to the �-axis\nReal axis\nImaginary axis\n�\n1 + �\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nWhen we want to be clear which value of � is meant, we will specify a branch of arg. For example,\n0 ≤ � < 2� or -� < � ≤ �. This will be discussed in much more detail in the coming weeks.\nKeeping careful track of the branches of arg will turn out to be one of the key requirements of\ncomplex analysis.\n1.6 Euler's Formula\nEuler's (pronounced 'oilers') formula connects complex exponentials, polar coordinates, and sines\nand cosines. It turns messy trig identities into tidy rules for exponentials. We will use it a lot. The\nformula is the following:\ne�� = cos(�) + � sin(�).\n(1)\nThere are many ways to approach Euler's formula. Our approach is to simply take Equation 1 as\nthe definition of complex exponentials. This is legal, but does not show that it's a good definition.\nTo do that we need to show the e�� obeys all the rules we expect of an exponential. To do that\nwe go systematically through the properties of exponentials and check that they hold for complex\nexponentials.\n1.6.1 e�� behaves like a true exponential\nP1. e�� differentiates as expected:\n�e��\n= �e�� .\n��\nProof. This follows directly from the definition:\n�e��\n= � (cos(�) + � sin(�)) = -sin(�) + � cos(�) = �(cos(�) + � sin(�)) = �e��.\n��\n��\nP2. e�⋅0 = 1.\nProof. e�⋅0 = cos(0) + � sin(0) = 1.\nP3. The usual rules of exponents hold:\ne��e�� = e�(�+�).\nProof. This relies on the cosine and sine addition formulas.\ne�� ⋅ e�� = (cos(�) + � sin(�)) ⋅ (cos(�) + � sin(�))\n= cos(�) cos(�) - sin(�) sin(�) + � (cos(�) sin(�) + sin(�) cos(�))\n= cos(� + �) + � sin(� + �) = e�(�+�).\nP4. The definition of e�� is consistent with the power series for e�.\nProof. To see this we have to recall the power series for e�, cos(�) and sin(�). They are\ne�\n�2\n�3\n�4\n= 1 + � +\n+\n+\n+ ...\n2!\n3!\n4!\n�4\n- �6\ncos(�) = 1 - �2\n+\n+ ...\n2!\n4!\n6!\nsin(�) = � - �3\n+ �5\n+ ...\n3!\n5!\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nNow we can write the power series for e�� and then split it into the power series for sine and cosine:\ninf\ne��\n∑ (��)�\n=\n�!\ninf\n�2�\ninf\n�2�+1\n∑\n∑\n=\n(-1)�\n+ �\n(-1)�\n(2�)!\n(2� + 1)!\n= cos(�) + � sin(�).\nSo the Euler formula definition is consistent with the usual power series for e�.\nProperties P1-P4 should convince you that e�� behaves like an exponential.\n1.6.2 Complex exponentials and polar form\nNow let's turn to the relation between polar coordinates and complex exponentials.\nSuppose � = � + �� has polar coordinates � and �. That is, we have � = � cos(�) and � = � sin(�).\nThus, we get the important relationship\n� = � + �� = � cos(�) + �� sin(�) = �(cos(�) + � sin(�)) = �e��.\nThis is so important you shouldn't proceed without understanding. We also record it without the\nintermediate equation.\n� = � + �� = �e��.\n(2)\nBecause � and � are the polar coordinates of (�, �) we call � = �e�� the polar form of �.\nLet's now verify that magnitude, argument, conjugate, multiplication and division are easy in polar\nform.\nMagnitude. |e��| = 1.\nProof.\n√\n|e��| = | cos(�) + � sin(�)| =\ncos2(�) + sin2(�) = 1.\nIn words, this says that e�� is always on the unit circle - this is useful to remember!\nLikewise, if � = �e�� then |�| = �. You can calculate this, but it should be clear from the definitions:\n|�| is the distance from � to the origin, which is exactly the same definition as for �.\nArgument. If � = �e�� then arg(�) = �.\nProof. This is again the definition: the argument is the polar angle �.\nConjugate. (�e��) = �e-��.\nProof.\n-��\n(�e��) = �(cos(�) + � sin(�)) = �(cos(�) - � sin(�)) = �(cos(-�) + � sin(-�)) = �e\n.\nIn words: complex conjugation changes the sign of the argument.\n= �1e��1 and �2\nMultiplication. If �1\n= �2e��2 then\n�1�2 = �1�2e�(�1+�2).\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nThis is what mathematicians call trivial to see, just write the multiplication down. In words, the\nformula says the for �1�2 the magnitudes multiply and the arguments add.\nDivision. Again it's trivial that\n�1e��1\n�1 e�(�1-�2)\n=\n.\n�2e��2\n�2\nExample 1.6. (Multiplication by 2�) Here's a simple but important example. By looking at the graph\nwe see that the number 2� has magnitude 2 and argument �∕2. So in polar coordinates it equals 2e��∕2.\nThis means that multiplication by 2� multiplies lengths by 2 and adds �∕2 to arguments, i.e. rotates\nby 90*. The effect is shown in the figures below\nRe\nIm\n2i = 2eiπ/2\nπ/2\nRe\nIm\nRe\nIm\n× 2i\n|2�| = 2, arg(2�) = �∕2\nMultiplication by 2� rotates by �∕2 and scales by 2\n(\n√)3\n1+� 3\nExample 1.7. (Raising to a power) Let's compute (1 + �)6 and\n√\n√\n2e��∕4\nSolution: 1 + � has magnitude =\n2 and arg = �∕4, so 1 + � =\n. Raising to a power is now\neasy:\n(√\n)6\n2e��∕4\n= 8e6��∕4 = 8e3��∕2\n(1 + �)6 =\n= -8�.\n√\n(\n√)3\nSimilarly, 1 + � 3 = e��∕3, so\n1 + � 3\n= (1 ⋅ e��∕3)3 = e�� = -1\n1.6.3 Complexification or complex replacement\nIn the next example we will illustrate the technique of complexification or complex replacement. This\ncan be used to simplify a trigonometric integral. It will come in handy when we need to compute\ncertain integrals.\nExample 1.8. Use complex replacement to compute\n� = ∫ e� cos(2�) ��.\nSolution: We have Euler's formula\n2��\ne\n= cos(2�) + � sin(2�),\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nso cos(2�) = Re(e2��). The complex replacement trick is to replace cos(2�) by e2��. We get (justifi\ncation below)\n�� = ∫ e� cos 2� + �e� sin 2���,\n� = Re(��).\nComputing �� is straightforward:\ne�(1+2�)\n�� = ∫ e�e�2� �� = ∫ e�(1+2�) �� =\n.\n1 + 2�\nHere we will do the computation first in rectangular coordinates. In applications, for example\nthroughout 18.03, polar form is often preferred because it is easier and gives the answer in a more\nuseable form.\ne�(1+2�)\n1 -2�\n�� =\n⋅\n1 + 2�\n1 -2�\ne�(cos(2�) + � sin(2�))(1 - 2�)\n=\n=\ne�(cos(2�) + 2 sin(2�) + �(-2 cos(2�) + sin(2�)))\nSo,\n� = Re(��) = e�(cos(2�) + 2 sin(2�)).\nJustification of complex replacement. The trick comes by cleverly adding a new integral to � as\nfollows. Let � = ∫ e� sin(2�) ��. Then we let\n�� = � + �� = ∫ e�(cos(2�) + � sin(2�)) �� = ∫ e�e2�� ��.\nClearly, by construction, Re(�� ) = � as claimed above.\nAlternative using polar coordinates to simplify the expression for �� :\n√\nIn polar form, we have 1 + 2� = �e��, where � =\n5 and � = arg(1 + 2�) = tan-1(2) in the first\nquadrant. Then:\ne�(1+2�)\ne�\ne�\ne�(2�-�)\n�� = √\n= √\n= √ (cos(2� - �) + � sin(2� - �)).\n5e��\nThus,\ne�\n� = Re(��) = √ cos(2� - �).\n1.6.4 �th roots\nWe are going to need to be able to find the �th roots of complex numbers, i.e., solve equations of the\nform\n�� = �,\nwhere � is a given complex number. This can be done most conveniently by expressing � and � in\npolar form, � = �e�� and � = �e��. Then, upon substituting, we have to solve\n�� e��� = �e��\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nFor the complex numbers on the left and right to be equal, their magnitudes must be the same and\ntheir arguments can only differ by an integer multiple of 2�. This gives\n� = �1∕�\n�� = � + 2��, where � = 0, ±1, ±2, ...\nSolving for �, we have\n�\n2��\n� =\n+\n.\n�\n�\nExample 1.9. Find all 5 fifth roots of 2.\nSolution: For � = 2, we have � = 2 and � = 0, so the fifth roots of 2 are\n= 21∕5 2���∕5\n��\ne\n, where � = 0, ±1, ±2, ...\nLooking at the right hand side we see that for � = 5 we have 21∕5e2�� which is exactly the same as\nthe root when � = 0, i.e. 21∕5e0�. Likewise � = 6 gives exactly the same root as � = 1, and so on.\nThis means, we have 5 different roots corresponding to � = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n= 21∕5, 21∕5e2��∕5, 21∕5e4��∕5, 21∕5e6��∕5, 21∕5e8��∕5\n��\nSimilarly we can say that in general � = �e�� has � distinct �th roots:\n= �1∕� e��∕�+� 2�(�∕�) for � = 0, 1, 2, ... � -1.\n��\nExample 1.10. Find the 4 fourth roots of 1.\nSolution: We need to solve �4 = 1, so � = 0. So the 4 distinct fourth roots are in polar form\n= 1, e��∕2, e��, e�3�∕2\n��\nand in Cartesian representation\n�� = 1, �, -1, -�.\nExample 1.11. Find the 3 cube roots of -1.\ne� �+� 2��\n, e��, e�5�∕3\nSolution: �2 = -1 =\n. So, �� = e� �∕3+� 2�(�∕3) and the 3 cube roots are e��∕3\n.\nSince �∕3 radians is 60* we can simpify:\n√\n√\ne��∕3 = cos(�∕3) + � sin(�∕3) =\n+ �\n⇒\n�� = -1,\n± �\nExample 1.12. Find the 5 fifth roots of 1 + �.\n√\nSolution: �5 = 1 + � =\n2e�(�∕4+2��), for � = 0, 1, 2, .... So, the 5 fifth roots are\n21∕10e��∕20, 21∕10e�9�∕20, 21∕10e�17�∕20, 21∕10e�25�∕20, 21∕10e�33�∕20.\nUsing a calculator we could write these numerically as � + ��, but there is no easy simplification.\nExample 1.13. We should check that our technique works as expected for a simple problem. Find\nthe 2 square roots of 4.\n= 4e� 2��\n= 2 and 2e��\nSolution: �2\n. So, �� = 2e� ��, with � = 0, 1. So the two roots are 2e0\n= -2\nas expected!\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\n1.6.5 The geometry of �th roots\nLooking at the examples above we see that roots are always spaced evenly around a circle centered\nat the origin. For example, the fifth roots of 1 + � are spaced at increments of 2�∕5 radians around\nthe circle of radius 21∕5.\nNote also that the roots of real numbers always come in conjugate pairs.\n�\n�\nCube roots of -1\n√\n1 + �\n+ � 2\n�\n�\n-1\n√\n- �\nFifth roots of 1 + �\n1.7 Inverse Euler formula\nEuler's formula gives a complex exponential in terms of sines and cosines. We can turn this around\nto get the inverse Euler formulas.\nEuler's formula says:\ne��\n-��\n= cos(�) + � sin(�)\nand\ne\n= cos(�) - � sin(�).\nBy adding and subtracting we get:\ne�� + e-��\ne�� - e-��\ncos(�) =\nand\nsin(�) =\n.\n2�\nPlease take note of these formulas we will use them frequently!\n1.8 de Moivre's formula\nFor positive integers � we have de Moivre's formula:\n(cos(�) + � sin(�))� = cos(��) + � sin(��)\nProof. This is a simple consequence of Euler's formula:\n= (e��)� = e���\n(cos(�) + � sin(�))�\n= cos(��) + � sin(��).\nThe reason this simple fact has a name is that historically de Moivre stated it before Euler's formula\nwas known. Without Euler's formula there is not such a simple proof.\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\n1.9 Representing complex multiplication as matrix multiplication\nConsider two complex numbers �1 = � + �� and �2 = � + �� and their product\n�1�2 = (� + ��)(� + ��) = (�� - ��) + �(�� + ��) =∶ �\n(3)\nNow let's define two matrices\n[\n]\n[\n]\n� -�\n� -�\n�1 =\n�2 =\n�\n�\n�\n�\nNote that these matrices store the same information as �1 and �2, respectively. Let's compute their\nmatrix product\n[\n] [\n]\n[\n]\n� -�\n� -�\n�� - �� -(�� + ��)\n�1�2 =\n=\n∶= � .\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�� + ��\n�� - ��\nComparing � just above with � in Equation 3, we see that � is indeed the matrix corresponding\nto the complex number � = �1�2. Thus, we can represent any complex number � equivalently by\nthe matrix\n[\n]\nRe � - Im �\n� = Im �\nRe �\nand complex multiplication then simply becomes matrix multiplication. Further note that we can\nwrite\n[\n]\n[\n]\n-1\n� = Re �\n+ Im �\n,\n[\n]\n0 -1\ni.e., the imaginary unit � corresponds to the matrix 1\nand �2 = -1 becomes\n[\n] [\n]\n[\n]\n-1\n-1\n= -\n.\nPolar form (decomposition). Writing � = �e�� = �(cos � + � sin �), we find\n[\n]\n[\n] [\n]\ncos � - sin �\n� 0\ncos � - sin �\n� = �\n=\nsin �\ncos �\n0 �\nsin �\ncos �\ncorresponding to a stretch factor � multiplied by a 2D rotation matrix. In particular, multiplication\nby � corresponds to the rotation with angle � = �∕2 and � = 1.\nWe will not make a lot of use of the matrix representation of complex numbers, but later it will help\nus remember certain formulas and facts.\n1.10 The exponential function\nWe have Euler's formula: e�� = cos(�) + � sin(�). We can extend this to the complex exponential\nfunction e�.\nDefinition. For � = � + �� the complex exponential function is defined as\ne� = e�+�� = e�e�� = e�(cos(�) + � sin(�)).\nIn this definition e� is the usual exponential function for a real variable �.\nIt is easy to see that all the usual rules of exponents hold:\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\n1. e0 = 1\n2. e�1+�2 = e�1e�2\n3. (e�)� = e�� for positive integers �.\n4. (e�)-1 = e-�\n5. e� = 0\nIt will turn out that the property �e�\n= e� also holds, but we can't prove this yet because we\n��\n�\nhaven't defined what we mean by the complex derivative\n.\n��\nHere are some more simple, but extremely important properties of e�. You should become\nfluent in their use and know how to prove them.\n6. |e��| = 1\nProof.\n√\n|e��| = | cos(�) + � sin(�)| =\ncos2(�) + sin2(�) = 1.\n7. |e�+��| = e� (as usual � = � + �� and �, � are real).\nProof. You should be able to supply this. If not: ask a teacher or TA.\n8. The path e�� for 0 < � < inf wraps counterclockwise around the unit circle. It does so infinitely\nmany times. This is illustrated in the following picture.\nt\nπ\nπ\n3π\nπ\n5π\n3π\n7π\n2π\n9π\n5π\n11π\n3π 13π\n7π\n15π\n4π\ne0 = e2πi = e4πi\neπi/4 = e9πi/4\neπi/2 = e5πi/2\n3eπi/4 = e11πi/4\neπi = e3πi\n5eπi/4 = e13πi/4\ne3πi/2 = e7πi/2\n7eπi/4 = e15πi/4\nz = eit\nThe map � → e�� wraps the real axis around the unit circle.\n1.11 Complex functions as mappings\nA complex function � = � (�) is hard to graph because it takes 4 dimensions: 2 for � and 2 for �. So,\nto visualize them we will think of complex functions as mappings. That is we will think of � = � (�)\nas taking a point in the complex �-plane and mapping (sending) it to a point in the complex �-plane.\nWe will use the following terms and symbols to discuss mappings.\n- A function � = � (�) will also be called a mapping of � to �.\n- Alternatively we will write � → � or � → � (�). This is read as \"� maps to �\".\n- We will say that \"� is the image of � under the mapping\" or more simply \"� is the image of\n�\".\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\n- If we have a set of points in the �-plane we will talk of the image of that set under the mapping.\nFor example, under the mapping � → �� the image of the imaginary �-axis is the real �-axis.\n� → � = ��\nRe(�)\nIm(�)\n�\nRe(�)\nIm(�)\n-1\nThe image of the imaginary axis under � → ��.\nNext, we'll illustrate visualizing mappings with some examples:\nExample 1.14. The mapping � = �2. We visualize this by putting the �-plane on the left and the\n�-plane on the right. We then draw various curves and regions in the �-plane and the corresponding\nimage under �2 in the �-plane.\nIn the first figure we show that rays from the origin are mapped by �2 to rays from the origin. We\nsee that\n1. The ray �2 at �∕4 radians is mapped to the ray � (�2) at �∕2 radians.\n2. The rays �2 and �6 are both mapped to the same ray. This is true for each pair of diametrically\nopposed rays.\n3. A ray at angle � is mapped to the ray at angle 2�.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nL1\nL2\nL3\nL4\nL5\nL6\nL7\nL8\nf(L1) & f(L5)\nf(L2) & f(L6)\nf(L3) & f(L7)\nf(L4) & f(L8)\nz 7→w = z2\n� (�) = �2 maps rays from the origin to rays from the origin.\nThe next figure gives another view of the mapping. Here we see vertical stripes in the first quadrant\nare mapped to parabolic stripes that live in the first and second quadrants.\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\n0.5 1\n0.5\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n1 2\n8 10 12 14 16\nz 7→w = z2\n�2 = (�2 - �2) + �2�� maps vertical lines to left facing parabolas.\nThe next figure is similar to the previous one, except in this figure we look at vertical stripes in\nboth the first and second quadrants. We see that they map to parabolic stripes that live in all four\nquadrants.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\n0.5 1\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n1 2\n8 10 12 14 16\nz 7→w = z2\n� (�) = �2 maps the first two quadrants to the entire plane.\nThe next figure shows the mapping of stripes in the first and fourth quadrants. The image map is\nidentical to the previous figure. This is because the fourth quadrant is minus the second quadrant,\nbut �2 = (-�)2.\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\n0.5 1\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n1 2\n8 10 12 14 16\nz 7→w = z2\nVertical stripes in quadrant 4 are mapped identically to vertical stripes in quadrant 2.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\nz 7→w = z2\nSimplified view of the first quadrant being mapped to the first two quadrants.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nz 7→w = z2\nSimplified view of the first two quadrants being mapped to the entire plane.\nExample 1.15.

Any horizontal stripe of width 2� gets mapped to the entire plane minus\nthe origin,\nBecause the plane minus the origin comes up frequently we give it a name:\nDefinition. The punctured plane is the complex plane minus the origin.

We say that � (�) is a\n2-to-1 function. That is, it maps 2 different points to each value. (Technically, it only maps one point\nto 0, but we will gloss over that for now.) Here are some other examples of many-to-one functions.\nExample 1.16. � = �3 is a 3-to-1 function. For example, 3 different � values get mapped to � = 1:\n(\n√\n)3\n(\n√\n)3\n-1 +\n3 �\n-1 -\n3 �\n13 =\n=\n= 1\nExample 1.17. The function � = e� maps infinitely many points to each value. For example\n2��\n4��\n2���\ne = e\n= e\n= ... = e\n= ... = 1\ne��∕2 = e��∕2+2�� = e��∕2+4�� = ... = e��∕2+2��� = ... = �\nIn general, e�+2��� has the same value for every integer �.\n\nx\ny\narg = 0\narg = π/4\narg = π/2\narg = 3π/4\narg = π\narg = 5π/4\narg = 3π/2\narg = 7π/4\narg ≈2π\narg ≈π\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\n1.12.2 Branches of arg(�)\nImportant note. You should master this section. Branches of arg(�) are the key that really underlies\nall our other examples. Fortunately it is reasonably straightforward.\nThe key point is that the argument is only defined up to multiples of 2�� so every � produces infinitely\nmany values for arg(�). Because of this we will say that arg(�) is a multiple-valued function.\nNote. In general a function should take just one value. What that means in practice is that whenever\nwe use such a function will have to be careful to specify which of the possible values we mean. This\nis known as specifying a branch of the function.\nDefinition. By a branch of the argument function we mean a choice of range so that it becomes\nsingle-valued. By specifying a branch we are saying that we will take the single value of arg(�) that\nlies in the branch.\nLet's look at several different branches to understand how they work:\n(i) If we specify the branch as 0 ≤ arg(�) < 2� then we have the following arguments.\narg(1) = 0;\narg(�) = �∕2;\narg(-1) = �;\narg(-�) = 3�∕2\nThis branch and these points are shown graphically in Figure (i) below.\nFigure (i): The branch 0 ≤ arg(�) < 2� of arg(�).\nNotice that if we start at � = 1 on the positive real axis we have arg(�) = 0. Then arg(�) increases\nas we move counterclockwise around the circle. The argument is continuous until we get back to the\npositive real axis. There it jumps from almost 2� back to 0.\nThere is no getting around (no pun intended) this discontinuity. If we need arg(�) to be continuous\nwe will need to remove (cut) the points of discontinuity out of the domain. The branch cut for this\nbranch of arg(�) is shown as a thick orange line in the figure. If we make the branch cut then the\ndomain for arg(�) is the plane minus the cut, i.e. we will only consider arg(�) for � not on the cut.\nFor future reference you should note that, on this branch, arg(�) is continuous near the negative real\naxis, i.e. the arguments of nearby points are close to each other.\n(ii) If we specify the branch as -� < arg(�) ≤ � then we have the following arguments:\narg(1) = 0;\narg(�) = �∕2;\narg(-1) = �;\narg(-�) = -�∕2\n\nx\ny\narg = 0\narg = π/4\narg = π/2\narg = 3π/4\narg = π\narg = -3π/4\narg = -π/2\narg = -π/4\narg ≈0\narg ≈-π\nx\ny\narg = 2π\narg = π/4\narg = π/2\narg = 3π/4\narg = π\narg = 5π/4\narg = 3π/2\narg = 7π/4\narg ≈2π\narg ≈π\narg ≈9π/4\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nThis branch and these points are shown graphically in Figure (ii) below.\nFigure (ii): The branch -� < arg(�) ≤ � of arg(�).\nCompare Figure (ii) with Figure (i). The values of arg(�) are the same in the upper half plane, but\nin the lower half plane they differ by 2�.\nFor this branch the branch cut is along the negative real axis. As we cross the branch cut the value\nof arg(�) jumps from � to something close to -�.\n(iii) Figure (iii) shows the branch of arg(�) with �∕4 ≤ arg(�) < 9�∕4.\nFigure (iii): The branch �∕4 ≤ arg(�) < 9�∕4 of arg(�).\nNotice that on this branch arg(�) is continuous at both the positive and negative real axes. The jump\nof 2� occurs along the ray at angle �∕4.\n(iv) Obviously, there are many many possible branches. For example,\n42 < arg(�) ≤ 42 + 2�.\n(v) We won't make use of this in 18.04, but, in fact, the branch cut doesn't have to be a straight line.\nAny curve that goes from the origin to infinity will do. The argument will be continuous except for\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\na jump by 2� when � crosses the branch cut.\n1.12.3 The principal branch of arg(�)\nBranch (ii) in the previous section is singled out and given a name:\nDefinition. The branch -� < arg(�) ≤ � is called the principal branch of arg(�). We will use the\nnotation Arg(�) (capital A) to indicate that we are using the principal branch. (Of course, in cases\nwhere we don't want there to be any doubt we will say explicitly that we are using the principal\nbranch.)\n1.12.4 Continuity of arg(�)\nThe examples above show that there is no getting around the jump of 2� as we cross the branch cut.\nThis means that when we need arg(�) to be continuous we will have to restrict its domain to the plane\nminus a branch cut.\n1.13 Concise summary of branches and branch cuts\nWe discussed branches and branch cuts for arg(�). Before talking about log(�) and its branches and\nbranch cuts we will give a short review of what these terms mean. You should probably scan this\nsection now and then come back to it after reading about log(�).\nConsider the function � = � (�). Suppose that � = � + �� and � = � + ��.\nDomain. The domain of � is the set of � where we are allowed to compute � (�).\nRange. The range (image) of � is the set of all � (�) for � in the domain, i.e. the set of all � reached\nby � .\nBranch. For a multiple-valued function, a branch is a choice of range for the function. We choose\nthe range to exclude all but one possible value for each element of the domain.\nBranch cut. A branch cut removes (cuts) points out of the domain. This is done to remove points\nwhere the function is discontinuous.\n1.14 The function log(�)\nOur goal in this section is to define the log function. We want log(�) to be the inverse of e�. That\nis, we want elog(�) = �. We will see that log(�) is multiple-valued, so when we use it we will have to\nspecify a branch.\nWe start by looking at the simplest example which illustrates that log(�) is multiple-valued.\nExample 1.18. Find log(1).\nSolution: We know that e0 = 1, so log(1) = 0 is one answer.\nWe also know that e2�� = 1, so log(1) = 2�� is another possible answer. In fact, we can choose any\nmultiple of 2��:\nlog(1) = 2���, where � is any integer\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nThis example leads us to consider the polar form for � as we try to define log(�). If � = �e�� then\none possible value for log(�) is\nlog(�) = log(�e��) = log(�) + ��,\nhere log(�) is the usual logarithm of a real positive number. For completeness we show explicitly\nthat with this definition elog(�) = �:\nlog(�)\nlog(�)+��\nlog(�)e�� = �e��\ne\n= e\n= e\n= �.\nSince � = |�| and � = arg(�) we have arrived at our definition.\nDefinition. The function log(�) is defined as\nlog(�) = log(|�|) + � arg(�),\nwhere log(|�|) is the usual natural logarithm of a positive real number.\nRemarks.\n1. Since arg(�) has infinitely many possible values, so does log(�).\n2. log(0) is not defined. (Both because arg(0) is not defined and log(|0|) is not defined.)\n3. Choosing a branch for arg(�) makes log(�) single valued. The usual terminology is to say we\nhave chosen a branch of the log function.\n4. The principal branch of log comes from the principal branch of arg. That is,\nlog(�) = log(|�|) + � arg(�), where - � < arg(�) ≤ �\n(principal branch).\nExample 1.19. Compute all the values of log(�). Specify which one comes from the principal\nbranch.\n�\nSolution: We have that |�| = 1 and arg(�) =\n+ 2��, so\n�\n�\nlog(�) = log(1) + � 2 + �2�� = � 2 + �2��, where � is any integer.\nThe principal branch of arg(�) is between -� and �, so Arg(�) = �∕2. Therefore, the value of log(�)\nfrom the principal branch is ��∕2.\n√\nExample 1.20. Compute all the values of log(-1 -\n3 �). Specify which one comes from the\nprincipal branch.\n√\nSolution: Let � = -1 -\n3 �. Then |�| = 2 and in the principal branch Arg(�) = -2�∕3. So all the\nvalues of log(�) are\n2�\nlog(�) = log(2) - �\n+ �2��.\nThe value from the principal branch is log(�) = log(2) - �2�∕3.\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\n1.14.1 Figures showing � = log(�) as a mapping\nThe figures below show different aspects of the mapping given by log(�).\nIn the first figure we see that a point � is mapped to (infinitely) many values of �. In this case we\nshow log(1) (blue dots), log(4) (red dots), log(�) (blue cross), and log(4�) (red cross). The values in\nthe principal branch are inside the shaded region in the �-plane. Note that the values of log(�) for a\ngiven � are placed at intervals of 2�� in the �-plane.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\n×\n×\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n-4π\n-4\n-2π\n-2\n2π\n4π\nπ\n-π\nz 7→w = log(z)\nz = ew ←w\nMapping log(�): log(1), log(4), log(�), log(4�)\nThe next figure illustrates that the principal branch of log maps the punctured plane to the horizontal\nstrip -� < Im(�) ≤ �. We again show the values of log(1), log(4), log(�) and log(4�). Since we've\nchosen a branch, there is only one value shown for each log.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\n×\n×\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n×\n×\n-4π\n-4\n-2π\n-2\n2π\n4π\nπ\n-π\nz 7→w = log(z)\nz = ew ←w\nMapping log(�): the principal branch and the punctured plane\nThe third figure shows how circles centered on 0 are mapped to vertical lines, and rays from the\norigin are mapped to horizontal lines. If we restrict ourselves to the principal branch the circles are\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nmapped to vertical line segments and rays to a single horizontal line in the principal (shaded) region\nof the �-plane.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n-4π\n-4\n-2π\n-2\n2π\n4π\nπ\n-π\nz 7→w = log(z)\nz = ew ←w\nMapping log(�): mapping circles and rays\n1.14.2 Complex powers\nWe can use the log function to define complex powers.\nDefinition. Let � and � be complex numbers then the power �� is defined as\n�� = e� log(�).\nThis is generally multiple-valued, so to specify a single value requires choosing a branch of log(�).\n√\nExample 1.21. Compute all the values of\n2�. Give the value associated to the principal branch of\nlog(�).\nSolution: We have\n��\n�\nlog(2�) = log(2e 2 ) = log(2) + � + �2��.\nSo,\n√\nlog(2�)\nlog(2) + ��\n√\n��\n2� = (2�)1∕2\n+���\n+���\n= e\n= e\n=\n2e 4\n.\n(As usual � is an integer.) As we saw earlier, this only gives two distinct values. The principal branch\nhas Arg(2�) = �∕2, so\n(\n)\n√\n√\n��\n√ (1 + �)\n2� =\n2e 4\n=\n2 √\n= 1 + �.\nThe other distinct value is when � = 1 and gives minus the value just above.\nExample 1.22. Cube roots: Compute all the cube roots of �. Give the value which comes from the\nprincipal branch of log(�).\n�\nSolution: We have log(�) = � + �2��, where � is any integer. So,\nlog(�)\n2��\n�1∕3\n� � +�\n= e 3\n= e 6\n\n1 COMPLEX ALGEBRA AND THE COMPLEX PLANE\nThis gives only three distinct values\ne��∕6,\ne�5�∕6,\ne�9�∕6\n�\nOn the principal branch log(�) = � , so the value of �1∕3 which comes from this is\n√\ne��∕6\n�\n=\n+ 2.\nExample 1.23. Compute all the values of 1�. What is the value from the principal branch?\nSolution: This is similar to the problems above. log(1) = 2���, so\n1� = e� log(1) = e�2���\n-2��\n= e\n, where � is an integer.\nThe principal branch has log(1) = 0 so 1� = 1.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Topic 10 Notes\nJeremy Orloff\n10 Conformal transformations\n10.1 Introduction\nIn this topic we will look at the geometric notion of conformal maps. It will turn out that analytic\nfunctions are automatically conformal. Once we have understood the general notion, we will look\nat a specific family of conformal maps called fractional linear transformations and, in particular at\ntheir geometric properties. As an application we will use fractional linear transformations to solve\nthe Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on the unit disk with specified values on the unit circle.\nAt the end we will return to some questions of fluid flow.\n10.2 Geometric definition of conformal mappings\nWe start with a somewhat hand-wavy definition:\nInformal definition. Conformal maps are functions on � that preserve the angles between curves.\nMore precisely: Suppose � (�) is differentiable at �0 and �(�) is a smooth curve through �0. To be\nconcrete, let's suppose �(�0) = �0. The function maps the point �0 to �0 = � (�0) and the curve � to\n�(�) = � (�(�)).\nUnder this map, the tangent vector � ′(�0) at �0 is mapped to the tangent vector\n� ′(�0) = (� *�)′(�0)\nat �0. With these notations we have the following definition.\nDefinition. The function � (�) is conformal at �0 if there is an angle � and a scale � > 0 such that\nfor any smooth curve �(�) through �0 the map � rotates the tangent vector at �0 by � and scales it by\n�. That is, for any �, the tangent vector (� *�)′(�0) is found by rotating � ′(�0) by � and scaling it by\n�.\nIf � (�) is defined on a region �, we say it is a conformal map on � if it is conformal at each point �\nin �.\nNote. The scale factor � and rotation angle � depends on the point �, but not on any of the curves\nthrough �.\nExample 10.1. The figure below shows a conformal map � (�) mapping two curves through �0 to\ntwo curves through �0 = � (�0). The tangent vectors to each of the original curves are both rotated\nand scaled by the same amount.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nx\ny\nγ′\n1(t0)\nγ1(t)\nγ′\n2(t0)\nγ2(t)\nz0\nu\nv\n(f *γ1)′(t0)\nf(γ1(t))\n(f *γ2)′(t0)\nf(γ2(t))\nw0\nz 7→w = f(z)\nw0 = f(z0)\nA conformal map rotates and scales all tangent vectors at �0 by the same ammount.\nRemark 1. Conformality is a local phenomenon. At a different point �1 the rotation angle and scale\nfactor might be different.\nRemark 2. Since rotations preserve the angles between vectors, a key property of conformal maps\nis that they preserve the angles between curves.\nExample 10.2. Recall that way back in Topic 1 we saw that � (�) = �2 maps horizontal and vertical\ngrid lines to mutually orthogonal parabolas. We will see that � (�) is conformal. So, the orthogonality\nof the parabolas is no accident. The conformal map preserves the right angles between the grid lines.\nx\ny\nu\nv\nz 7→w = z2\n10.3 Tangent vectors as complex numbers\nIn 18.02, you used parametrized curves �(�) = (�(�), �(�)) in the ��-plane. Considered this way, the\ntangent vector is just the derivative:\n� ′(�) = (� ′(�), � ′(�)).\nNote, as a vector, (� ′ , � ′) represents a displacement. If the vector starts at the origin, then the endpoint\nis at (� ′ , � ′). More typically we draw the vector starting at the point �(�).\n\n|||\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nIn 18.04, we use parametrized curves �(�) = �(�) + ��(�) in the complex plane. Considered this way,\nthe tangent vector is just the derivative:\n� ′(�) = � ′(�) + �� ′(�).\nIt should be clear that these representations are equivalent. The vector (� ′ , � ′) and the complex\nnumber � ′ + �� ′ both represent the same displacement. Also, the length of a vector and the angle\nbetween two vectors is the same in both representations.\nThinking of tangent vectors to curves as complex numbers allows us to recast conformality in terms\nof complex numbers.\nTheorem 10.3. If � (�) is conformal at �0 then there is a complex number � = �e�� such that the\nmap � multiplies tangent vectors at �0 by �. Conversely, if the map � multiplies all tangent vectors\nat �0 by � = �e�� then � is conformal at �0.\nProof. By definition � is conformal at �0 means that there is an angle � and a scalar � > 0 such\nthat the map � rotates tangent vectors at �0 by � and scales them by �. This is exactly the effect of\nmultiplication by � = �e��.\n10.4 Analytic functions are conformal\nTheorem 10.4. (Operational definition of conformal) If � is analytic on the region � and � ′(�0) = 0,\nthen � is conformal at �0. Furthermore, the map � multiplies tangent vectors at �0 by � ′(�0).\nProof. The proof is a quick computation. Suppose � = �(�) is curve through �0 with �(�0) = �0. The\ncurve �(�) is transformed by � to the curve � = � (�(�)). By the chain rule we have\n�� (�(�))\n= � ′(�(�0))� ′(�0) = � ′(�0)� ′(�0).\n��\n|�0\nThe theorem now follows from Theorem 10.3.\nExample 10.5. (Basic example) Suppose � = �e�� and consider the map � (�) = ��. Geometrically,\nthis map rotates every point by � and scales it by �. Therefore, it must have the same effect on all\ntangent vectors to curves. Indeed, � is analytic and � ′(�) = � is constant.\nExample 10.6. Let � (�) = �2. So � ′(�) = 2�. Thus the map � has a different affect on tangent\nvectors at different points �1 and �2.\nExample 10.7. (Linear approximation) Suppose � (�) is analytic at � = 0. The linear approximation\n(first two terms of the Taylor series) is\n� (�) ≈ � (0) + � ′(0)�.\nIf �(�) is a curve with �(�0) = 0 then, near �0,\n� (�(�)) ≈ � (0) + � ′(0)�(�).\nThat is, near 0, � looks like our basic example plus a shift by � (0).\nExample 10.8. The map � (�) = � has lots of nice geometric properties, but it is not conformal. It\npreserves the length of tangent vectors and the angle between tangent vectors. The reason it isn't\nconformal is that is does not rotate tangent vectors. Instead, it reflects them across the �-axis.\nIn other words, it reverses the orientation of a pair of vectors. Our definition of conformal maps\nrequires that it preserves orientation.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\n10.5 Digression to harmonic functions\nTheorem 10.9. If � and � are harmonic conjugates and � = � + �� has � ′(�0) = 0, then the level\ncurves of � and � through �0 are orthogonal.\nNote. We proved this in an earlier topic using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Here will make an\nargument involving conformal maps.\nProof. First we'll examine how � maps the level curve �(�, �) = �. Since � = � + ��, the image of\nthe level curve is � = � + ��, i.e it's (contained in) a vertical line in the �-plane. Likewise, the level\ncurve �(�, �) = � is mapped to the horizontal line � = � + ��.\nThus, the images of the two level curves are orthogonal. Since � is conformal it preserves the angle\nbetween the level curves, so they must be orthogonal.\nx\ny\nu = a\nv = b\nz0\nu\nv\nu = a\nv = b\nw0\nz 7→w = g(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\nw0 = g(z0)\n� = � + �� maps level curves of � and � to grid lines.\n10.6 Riemann mapping theorem\nThe Riemann mapping theorem is a major theorem on conformal maps. The proof is fairly technical\nand we will skip it. In practice, we will write down explicit conformal maps between regions.\nTheorem 10.10. (Riemann mapping theorem) If � is simply connected and not the whole plane,\nthen there is a bijective conformal map from � to the unit disk.\nCorollary. For any two such regions there is a bijective conformal map from one to the other. We\nsay they are conformally equivalent.\n10.7 Fractional linear transformations\nDefinition. A fractional linear transformation is a function of the form\n�� + �\n� (�) =\n, where �, �, �, � are complex constants and �� - �� = 0\n�� + �\nThese are also called Mobius transforms or bilinear transforms. We will abbreviate fractional linear\ntransformation as FLT.\nSimple point. If �� - �� = 0 then � (�) is a constant function.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nProof. The full proof requires that we deal with all the cases where some of the coefficients are 0.\nWe'll give the proof assuming � = 0 and leave the case � = 0 to you. Assuming � = 0, the condition\n�� - �� = 0 implies\n� (�, �) = (�, �).\n�\nSo,\n(�∕�)(�� + �)\n�\n� (�) =\n= .\n�� + �\n�\nThat is, � (�) is constant.\nExtension to inf. It will be convenient to consider linear transformations to be defined on the ex\ntended complex plane � ∪ {inf} by defining\n{\n�∕�\nif � = 0\n� (inf) =\ninf\nif � = 0\n� (-�∕�) = inf\nif � = 0.\n10.7.1 Examples\nExample 10.11. (Scale and rotate) Let � (�) = ��. If � = � is real this scales the plane. If � = e�� it\nrotates the plane. If � = �e�� it does both at once.\nx\ny\n-1\n-2\n-i\ni\n2i\nu\nv\n-2\n-1\n-i\ni\n2i\nz 7→w = az\na = reiθ\nMultiplication by � = �e�� scales by � and rotates by �\nNote that � is the fractional linear transformation with coefficients\n[\n]\n[\n]\n�\n�\n� 0\n=\n.\n� �\n(We'll see below the benefit of presenting the coefficients in matrix form!)\nExample 10.12. (Scale and rotate and translate) Let � (�) = �� + �. Adding the � term introduces a\ntranslation to the previous example.\nx\ny\n-1\n-2\n-i\ni\n2i\nu\nv\n-2\n-1\n-i\ni\n2i\nz 7→w = az + b\nThe map � = �� + � scales, rotates and shifts the square.\n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nNote that � is the fractional linear transformation with coefficients\n[\n]\n[\n]\n�\n�\n�\n�\n=\n.\n� �\nExample 10.13. (Inversion) Let � (�) = 1∕�. This is called an inversion. It turns the unit circle\ninside out. Note that � (0) = inf and � (inf) = 0. In the figure below the circle that is outside the unit\ncircle in the � plane is inside the unit circle in the � plane and vice-versa. Note that the arrows on\nthe curves are reversed.\nx\ny\ni\nu\nv\ni\nz 7→w = 1/z\nThe map � = 1∕� inverts the plane.\nNote that � is the fractional linear transformation with coefficients\n[\n]\n[\n]\n� �\n=\n.\n� �\nExample 10.14. Let\n� - �\n� (�) =\n.\n� + �\nWe claim that this maps the �-axis to the unit circle and the upper half-plane to the unit disk.\nProof. First take � real, then\n√\n� - �\n�2 + 1\n|� (�)| = |� + �| = √\n= 1.\n�2 + 1\nSo, � maps the �-axis to the unit circle.\nNext take � = � + �� with � > 0, i.e. � in the upper half-plane. Clearly\n|� + 1| > |� -1|,\nso\n|� + �| = |� + �(� + 1)| > |� + �(� - 1)| = |� - �|,\nimplying that\n� - �\n|� (�)| = |� + �| < 1.\nSo, � maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk.\nWe will use this map frequently, so for the record we note that\n� (�) = 0,\n� (inf) = 1,\n� (-1) = �,\n� (0) = -1,\n� (1) = -�.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nThese computations show that the real axis is mapped counterclockwise around the unit circle start\ning at 1 and coming back to 1.\nx\ny\n-1\ni\nu\nv\ni\n-i\nz 7→w = z -i\nz + i\n� - �\nThe map � =\nmaps the upper-half plane to the unit disk.\n� + �\n10.7.2 Lines and circles\nTheorem. A linear fractional transformation maps lines and circles to lines and circles.\nBefore proving this, note that it does not say lines are mapped to lines and circles to circles. For\nexample, in Example 10.14 the real axis is mapped the unit circle. You can also check that inversion\n� = 1∕� maps the line � = 1 + �� to the circle |� - 1∕2| = 1∕2.\nProof. We start by showing that inversion maps lines and circles to lines and circles. Given � and\n� = 1∕� we define �, �, � and � by\n� - ��\n� = � + ��\nand\n� =\n=\n= � + ��\n�\n�2 + �2\nSo,\n� =\n�\nand\n� = -\n�\n�2 + �2\n�2 + �2 .\nNow, every circle or line can be described by the equation\n�� + �� + �(�2 + �2) = �\n(If � = 0 it descibes a line, otherwise a circle.) We convert this to an equation in �, � as follows.\n�� + �� + �(�2 + �2) = �\n��\n��\n�\n⇔\n+\n+ � =\n�2 + �2\n�2 + �2\n�2 + �2\n⇔\n�� - �� + � = �(�2 + �2).\nIn the last step we used the fact that\n�2 + �2 = |�|2 = 1∕|�|2 = 1∕(�2 + �2).\nWe have shown that a line or circle in �, � is transformed to a line or circle in �, �. This shows that\ninversion maps lines and circles to lines and circles.\nWe note that for the inversion � = 1∕�.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\n1. Any line not through the origin is mapped to a circle through the origin.\n2. Any line through the origin is mapped to a line through the origin.\n3. Any circle not through the origin is mapped to a circle not through the origin.\n4. Any circle through the origin is mapped to a line not through the origin.\nNow, to prove that an arbitrary fractional linear transformation maps lines and circles to lines and\ncircles, we factor it into a sequence of simpler transformations.\nFirst suppose that � = 0. So,\n� (�) = (�� + �)∕�.\nSince this is just translation, scaling and rotating, it is clear it maps circles to circles and lines to\nlines.\nNow suppose that � = 0. Then,\n� (�� + �) + � - ��\n�� + �\n�\n�\n�\n� - ��∕�\n� (�) =\n=\n=\n+\n�� + �\n�� + �\n�\n�� + �\nSo, � = � (�) can be computed as a composition of transforms\n�\n→\n�1 = �� + �\n→\n�2 = 1∕�1\n→\n� = � + (� - ��∕�)�2\n�\nWe know that each of the transforms in this sequence maps lines and circles to lines and circles.\nTherefore the entire sequence does also. □\n10.7.3 Mapping �� to ��\nIt turns out that for two sets of three points �1, �2, �3 and �1, �2, �3 there is a fractional linear\ntransformation that takes �� to �� . We can construct this map as follows.\nLet\n(� - �1)(�2 - �3)\n�1(�) = (� - �3)(�2 - �1).\nNotice that\n�1(�1) = 0,\n�1(�2) = 1,\n�1(�3) = inf.\nLikewise let\n(� - �1)(�2 - �3)\n�2(�) = (� - �3)(�2 - �1).\nNotice that\n�2(�1) = 0,\n�2(�2) = 1,\n�2(�3) = inf.\nNow � (�) = � -1*�1(�) is the required map.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\n10.7.4 Correspondence with matrices\nWe can identify the transformation\n�� + �\n� (�) = �� + �\nwith the matrix\n[\n]\n� � .\n� �\nThis identification is useful because of the following algebraic facts.\n[\n]\n[\n]\n�\n�\n�\n�\n1. If � = 0 then\nand �\ncorrespond to the same FLT.\n�\n�\n�\n�\nProof. This follows from the obvious equality\n�� + �\n��� + ��\n=\n.\n�� + �\n��� + ��\n[\n]\n[\n]\n�\n�\n�\n�\n2. If � (�) corresponds to � =\nand �(�) corresponds to � =\nthen composition\n�\n�\n�\nh\n� *�(�) corresponds to matrix multiplication ��.\nProof. The proof is just a bit of algebra.\n(\n)\n�� + �\n� ((�� + � )∕(�� + h)) + �\n(�� + ��)� + �� + �h\n� *�(�) = �\n=\n=\n�� + h\n� ((�� + � )∕(�� + h)) + �\n(�� + ��)� + �� + �h\n[\n] [\n]\n[\n]\n� �\n� �\n�� + �� �� + �h\n�� =\n=\n�\n�\n�\nh\n�� + �� �� + �h\nThe claimed correspondence is clear from the last entries in the two lines above.\n[\n]\n� �\n3. If � (�) corresponds to � =\nthen � has an inverse and � -1(�) corresponds to �-1 and\n� �\n[\n]\n�\n-�\nalso to\n, i.e. to �-1 without the factor of 1∕ det(�).\n-�\n�\nProof. Since ��-1 = � it is clear from the previous fact that � -1 corresponds to �-1. Since\n[\n]\n�\n-�\n�-1 = �� - �� -�\n�\n[\n]\n�\n-�\nFact 1 implies �-1 and\nboth correspond to the same FLT, i.e. to � -1.\n-�\n�\nExample 10.15.\n[\n]\n� �\n1. The matrix 0\n1 corresponds to � (�) = �� + �.\n[\n]\ne��\n2. The matrix\ne-\n�� corresponds to rotation by 2�.\n[\n]\n3. The matrix 1\n0 corresponds to the inversion � = 1∕�.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\n10.8 Reflection and symmetry\n10.8.1 Reflection and symmetry in a line\nExample 10.16. Suppose we have a line � and a point �1 not on �. The reflection of �1 in � is the\npoint �2 so that � is the perpendicular bisector to the line segment �1�2. Since there is exactly one\nsuch point �2, the reflection of a point in a line is unique.\nDefinition. If �2 is the reflection of �1 in �, we say that �1 and �2 are symmetric with respect to the\nline �.\nIn the figure below the points �1 and �2 are symmetric in the �-axis. The points �3 and �4 are\nsymmetric in the line �.\nx\ny\nz1\nz2\na\na\nS\nz3\nz4\nb\nb\nIn order to define the reflection of a point in a circle we need to work a little harder. Looking back\nat the previous example we can show the following.\nFact. If �1 and �2 are symmetric in the line �, then any circle through �1 and �2 intersects �\northogonally.\nProof. Call the circle �. Since � is the perpendicular bisector of a chord of �, the center of � lies\non �. Therefore � is a radial line, i.e. it intersects � orthogonally.\nx\ny\nz1\nz2\na\na\nS\nz3\nz4\nb\nb\nCircles through symmetric points intersect the line at right angles.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\n10.8.2 Reflection and symmetry in a circle\nWe will adapt this for our definition of reflection in a circle. So that the logic flows correctly we\nneed to start with the definition of symmetric pairs of points.\nDefinition. Suppose � is a line or circle. A pair of points �1, �2 is called symmetric with respect to\n� if every line or circle through the two points intersects � orthogonally.\nFirst we state an almost trivial fact.\nFact. Fractional linear transformations preserve symmetry. That is, if �1 and �2 are symmetric in a\nline or circle �, then, for an FLT � , � (�1) and � (�2) are symmetric in � (�).\nProof. The definition of symmetry is in terms of lines and circles, and angles. Fractional linear\ntransformations map lines and circles to lines and circles and, being conformal, preserve angles. □\nTheorem. Suppose � is a line or circle and �1 a point not on �. There is a unique point �2 such that\nthe pair �1, �2 is symmetric in �.\nProof. Let � be a fractional linear transformation that maps � to a line. We know that �1 = � (�1)\nhas a unique reflection �2 in this line. Since � -1 preserves symmetry, �1 and �2 = � -1(�2) are\nsymmetric in �. Since �2 is the unique point symmetric to �1 the same is true for �2 vis-a-vis �1.\nThis is all shown in the figure below.\nx\ny\nz1\nz2 = T -1(w2)\nS\nx\ny\nw1 = T(z1)\nw2\nT(S)\nw = T(z)\nWe can now define reflection in a circle.\nDefinition. The point �2 in the theorem is called the reflection of �1 in �.\n10.8.3 Reflection in the unit circle\nUsing the symmetry preserving feature of fractional linear transformations, we start with a line and\ntransform to the circle. Let � be the real axis and � the unit circle. We know the FLT\n� - �\n� (�) = � + �\nmaps � to �. We also know that the points � and � are symmetric in �. Therefore\n� - �\n� - �\n�1 = � (�) =\nand �2 = � (�) =\n� + �\n� + �\nare symmetric in �. Looking at the formulas, it is clear that �2 = 1∕�1. This is important enough\nthat we highlight it as a theorem.\nTheorem. (Reflection in the unit circle) The reflection of � = � + �� = �e�� in the unit circle is\ne��\n�\n� + ��\n=\n=\n=\n.\n�\n|�|2\n�2 + �2\n�\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nThe calculations from 1∕� are all trivial.\nNotes.\n1. It is possible, but more tedious and less insightful, to arrive at this theorem by direct calcula\ntion.\n2. If � is on the unit circle then 1∕� = �. That is, � is its own reflection in the unit circle -as it\nshould be.\n3. The center of the circle 0 is symmetric to the point at inf.\nThe figure below shows three pairs of points symmetric in the unit circle:\n1 + �\n-2 + �\n�1 = 2; �1 =\n�2 = 1 + �; �2 =\n,\n�3 = -2 + �; �3 =\n.\n2,\nx\ny\ni\nz1\nw1\nz2\nw2\nz3\nw3\nPairs of points �� ; �� symmetric in the unit circle.\nExample 10.17. Reflection in the circle of radius �. Suppose � is the circle |�| = � and �1 is a\npoint not on �. Find the reflection of �1 in �.\nSolution: Our strategy is to map � to the unit circle, find the reflection and then map the unit circle\nback to �.\nStart with the map � (�) = � = �∕�. Clearly � maps � to the unit circle and\n�1 = � (�1) = �1∕�.\nThe reflection of �1 is\n�2 = 1∕�1 = �∕�1.\nMapping back from the unit circle by � -1 we have\n�2 = � -1(�2) = ��2 = �2∕�1.\nTherefore the reflection of �1 is �2∕�1.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nHere are three pairs of points symmetric in the circle of radius 2. Note, that this is the same figure\nas the one above with everything doubled.\n-4 + 2�\n�1 = 4; �1 = 1,\n�2 = 2 + 2�; �2 = 1 + �,\n�3 = -4 + 2�; �3 =\n.\nx\ny\ni\nz1\nw1\nz2\nw2\nz3\nw3\nPairs of points �� ; �� symmetric in the circle of radius 2.\nExample 10.18. Find the reflection of �1 in the circle of radius � centered at �.\nSolution: Let � (�) = (� - �)∕�. � maps the circle centered at � to the unit circle. The inverse map\nis\n� -1(�) = �� + �.\nSo, the reflection of �1 is given by mapping � to � (�), reflecting this in the unit circle, and mapping\nback to the original geometry with � -1. That is, the reflection �2 is\n�1 - �\n�\n�2\n�1 →\n→\n→ �2 =\n+ �.\n�\n�1 - �\n�1 - �\nWe can now record the following important fact.\nFact. (Reflection of the center) For a circle � with center � the pair �, inf is symmetric with respect\nto the circle.\nProof. This is an immediate consequence of the formula for the reflection of a point in a circle. For\nexample, the reflection of � in the unit circle is 1∕�. So, the reflection of 0 is infinity.\nExample 10.19. Show that if a circle and a line don't intersect then there is a pair of points �1, �2\nthat is symmetric with respect to both the line and circle.\nSolution: By shifting, scaling and rotating we can find a fractional linear transformation � that maps\nthe circle and line to the following configuration: The circle is mapped to the unit circle and the line\nto the vertical line � = � > 1.\nx\ny\na\n1/r\nr\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nFor any real �, �1 = � and �2 = 1∕� are symmetric in the unit circle. We can choose a specific � so\nthat � and 1∕� are equidistant from �, i.e. also symmetric in the line � = �. It is clear geometrically\nthat this can be done. Algebraically we solve the equation\n√\n√\n� + 1∕�\n= �\n⇒\n�2 -2�� + 1 = 0\n⇒\n� = � +\n�2 -1\n⇒\n= � -\n�2 -1.\n�\n√\n√\nThus �1 = � -1(� +\n�2 -1) and �2 = � -1(� -\n�2 -1) are the required points.\nExample 10.20. Show that if two circles don't intersect then there is a pair of points �1, �2 that is\nsymmetric with respect to both circles.\nSolution: Using a fractional linear transformation that maps one of the circles to a line (and the other\nto a circle) we can reduce the problem to that in the previous example.\nExample 10.21. Show that any two circles that don't intersect can be mapped conformally to con\ncentric circles.\nSolution: Call the circles �1 and �2. Using the previous example start with a pair of points �1, �2\nwhich are symmetric in both circles. Next, pick a fractional linear transformation � that maps �1 to\n0 and �2 to infinity. For example,\n� - �1\n� (�) =\n.\n� - �2\nSince � preserves symmetry 0 and inf are symmetric in the circle � (�1). This implies that 0 is the\ncenter of � (�1). Likewise 0 is the center of � (�2). Thus, � (�1) and � (�2) are concentric.\n10.9 Solving the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions\nIn general, a Dirichlet problem in a region � asks you to solve a partial differential equation in �\nwhere the values of the solution on the boundary of � are specificed.\nExample 10.22. Find a function � harmonic on the unit disk such that\n{\nfor 0 < � < �\n�(e��) =\nfor -� < � < 0\nThis is a Dirichlet problem because the values of � on the boundary are specified. The partial differ\nential equation is implied by requiring that � be harmonic, i.e. we require ∇2� = 0. We will solve\nthis problem in due course.\n10.9.1 Harmonic functions on the upper half-plane\nOur strategy will be to solve the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on the upper half-plane\nand then transfer these solutions to other domains.\nExample 10.23. Find a harmonic function �(�, �) on the upper half-plane that satisfies the boundary\ncondition\n{\nfor � < 0\n�(�, 0) =\nfor � > 0\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nSolution: We can write down a solution explicitly as\n�(�, �) =\n�,\n�\nwhere � is the argument of � = � + ��. Since we are only working on the upper half-plane we can\ntake any convenient branch with branch cut in the lower half-plane, say -�∕2 < � < 3�∕2.\nx\ny\nu = 1\nu = 0\nz = x + iy\nr2\nr1\nθ\nTo show � is truly a solution, we have to verify two things:\n1. � satisfies the boundary conditions\n2. � is harmonic.\n)\nBoth of these are straightforward. First, look at the point �2 on the positive �-axis. This has argument\n� = 0, so �(�2, 0) = 0. Likewise arg(�1) = �, so �(�1, 0) = 1. Thus, we have shown point (1).\nTo see point (2) remember that\nlog(�) = log(�) + ��.\nSo,\n( 1\n� = Re\nlog(�)\n��\nSince it is the real part of an analytic function, � is harmonic.\n.\nExample 10.24. Suppose �1 < �2 < �3. Find a harmonic function � on the upper half-plane that\nsatisfies the boundary condition\n�(�, 0) =\n⎧\n⎪\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪\n⎪⎩\n�0\nfor � < �1\n�1\nfor �1 < � < �2\n�2\nfor �2 < � < �3\n�3\nfor �3 < �\nSolution: We mimic the previous example and write down the solution\n�3\n�2\n�1\n�(�, �) = �3 + (�2 - �3)\n+ (�1 - �2)\n+ (�0 - �1)\n.\n�\n�\n�\nHere, the �� are the angles shown in the figure. One again, we chose a branch of � that has 0 < � < �\nfor points in the upper half-plane. (For example the branch -�∕2 < � < 3�∕2.)\nx\ny\nx1\nx2\nx3\nu = c0\nu = c1\nu = c2\nu = c3\nz = x + iy\nθ1\nθ2\nθ3\nr0\nr1\nr2\nr3\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nTo convince yourself that � satisfies the boundary condition test a few points:\n- At �3: all the �� = 0. So, �(�3, 0) = �3 as required.\n- At �2: �1 = �2 = 0, �3 = �. So, �(�2, 0) = �3 + �2 - �3 = �2 as required.\n- Likewise, at �1 and �0, � have the correct values.\nAs before, � is harmonic because it is the real part of the analytic function\n(�2 - �3)\n(�1 - �2)\n(�1 - �0)\nΦ(�) = �3 +\nlog(� - �3) +\nlog(� - �2) +\nlog(� - �1).\n��\n��\n��\n10.9.2 Harmonic functions on the unit disk\nLet's try to solve a problem similar to the one in Example 10.22.\nExample 10.25. Find a function � harmonic on the unit disk such that\n{\n�(e��) =\nfor -�∕2 < � < �∕2\nfor �∕2 < � < 3�∕2\nx\ny\ni\n-i\nu = 1\nu = 0\nz\nSolution: Our strategy is to start with a conformal map � from the upper half-plane to the unit disk.\nWe can use this map to pull the problem back to the upper half-plane. We solve it there and then\npush the solution back to the disk.\nLet's call the disk �, the upper half-plane �. Let � be the variable on � and � the variable on �.\nBack in Example 10.14 we found a map from � to �. The map and its inverse are\n� - �\n�� + �\n� = � (�) =\n,\n� = � -1(�) =\n� + �\n-� + 1.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\ni\n-i\nu = 1\nu = 0\nz\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n-1\nφ = 1\nφ = 1\nφ = 0\nw\nθ1\nθ2\nw = T -1(z) =\niz+i\n-z+1\nz = T(w) = w-i\nw+i\nThe function � on � is transformed by � to a function � on �. The relationships are\n�(�) = �*� -1(�)\nor\n�(�) = �*� (�)\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nThese relationships determine the boundary values of � from those we were given for �. We compute:\n� -1(�) = -1,\n� -1(-�) = 1,\n� -1(1) = inf,\n� -1(-1) = 0.\nThis shows the left hand semicircle bounding � is mapped to the segment [-1, 1] on the real axis.\nLikewise, the right hand semicircle maps to the two half-lines shown. (Literally, to the 'segment' 1\nto inf to -1.)\nWe know how to solve the problem for a harmonic function � on �:\n(\n)\n�(�) = 1 - 1 �2 + �1 = Re 1 - 1 log(� -1) + 1 log(� + 1) .\n�\n�\n��\n��\nTransforming this back to the disk we have\n(\n)\n�(�) = �*� -1(�) = Re 1 - 1 log(� -1(�) -1) + 1 log(� -1(�) + 1) .\n��\n��\nIf we wanted to, we could simplify this somewhat using the formula for � -1.\n10.10 Flows around cylinders\n10.10.1 Milne-Thomson circle theorem\nThe Milne-Thomson theorem allows us to insert a circle into a two-dimensional flow and see how\nthe flow adjusts. First we'll state and prove the theorem.\nTheorem. (Milne-Thomson circle theorem) If � (�) is a complex potential with all its singularities\noutside |�| = � then\n(\n)\n�2\nΦ(�) = � (�) + �\n�\nis a complex potential with streamline on |�| = � and the same singularities as � in the region\n|�| > �.\nProof. First note that �2∕� is the reflection of � in the circle |�| = �.\nNext we need to see that � (�2∕�) is analytic for |�| > �. By assumption � (�) is analytic for |�| ≤ �,\nso it can be expressed as a Taylor series\n� (�) = �0 + �1� + �2�2 + ...\n(1)\nTherefore,\n(\n)\n(\n)2\n�2\n�2\n�2\n�\n= �0 + �1\n+ �2\n+ ...\n(2)\n�\n�\n�\nAll the singularities of � are outside |�| = �, so the Taylor series in Equation 1 converges for\n|�| ≤ �. This means the Laurent series in Equation 2 converges for |�| ≥ �. That is, � (�2∕�) is\nanalytic for |�| ≥ �, i.e. it introduces no singularies to Φ(�) outside |�| = �.\nThe last thing to show is that |�| = � is a streamline for Φ(�). This follows because for � = �e��\nΦ(�e��) = � (�e��) + � (�e��)\nis real. Therefore\n�(�e��) = Im(Φ(�e��) = 0.\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\n10.10.2 Examples\nThink of � (�) as representing flow, possibly with sources or vortices outside |�| = �. Then Φ(�)\nrepresents the new flow when a circular obstacle is placed in the flow. Here are a few examples.\nExample 10.26. (Uniform flow around a circle) We know from Topic 6 that � (�) = � is the complex\npotential for uniform flow to the right. So,\nΦ(�) = � + �2∕�\nis the potential for uniform flow around a circle of radius � centered at the origin.\nUniform flow around a circle\nJust because they look nice, the figure includes streamlines inside the circle. These don't interact\nwith the flow outside the circle.\nNote, that as � gets large flow looks uniform. We can see this analytically because\nΦ′(�) = 1 - �2∕�2\ngoes to 1 as � gets large. (Recall that the velocity field is (��, ��), where Φ = � + �� ...)\nExample 10.27. (Source flow around a circle) Here the source is at � = -2 (outside the unit circle)\nwith complex potential\n� (�) = log(� + 2).\nWith the appropriate branch cut the singularities of � are also outside |�| = 1. So we can apply\nMilne-Thomson and obtain\n(1\n)\nΦ(�) = log(� + 2) + log\n+ 2\n�\nSource flow around a circle\nWe know that far from the origin the flow should look the same as a flow with just a source at � = -2.\nLet's see this analytically. First we state a useful fact:\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\nUseful fact. If �(�) is analytic then so is h(�) = �(�) and h ′(�) = � ′(�).\nProof. Use the Taylor series for � to get the Taylor series for h and then compare h ′(�) and � ′(�). □\nUsing this we have\nΦ′(�) =\n-\n� + 2\n�(1 + 2�)\nFor large � the second term decays much faster than the first, so\nΦ′(�) ≈\n� + 2.\nThat is, far from � = 0, the velocity field looks just like the velocity field for � (�), i.e. the velocity\nfield of a source at � = -2.\nExample 10.28. (Transforming flows) If we use\n�(�) = �2\nwe can transform a flow from the upper half-plane to the first quadrant\nSource flow around a quarter circular corner\n10.11 Examples of conformal maps and excercises\nAs we've seen, once we have flows or harmonic functions on one region, we can use conformal maps\nto map them to other regions. In this section we will offer a number of conformal maps between\nvarious regions. By chaining these together along with scaling, rotating and shifting we can build a\nlarge library of conformal maps. Of course there are many many others that we will not touch on.\nFor convenience, in this section we will let\n� - �\n�0(�) =\n.\n� + �\nThis is our standard map of taking the upper half-plane to the unit disk.\nExample 10.29. Let �� be the half-plane above the line\n� = tan(�)�,\n\n10 CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATIONS\ni.e., {(�, �) ∶ � > tan(�)�}. Find an FLT from �� to the unit disk.\nSolution: We do this in two steps. First use the rotation\n-���\n�-�(�) = e\nto map �� to the upper half-plane. Follow this with the map �0. So our map is �0*�-� (�).\nYou supply the picture\nExample 10.30. Let � be the channel 0 ≤ � ≤ � in the ��-plane. Find a conformal map from � to\nthe upper half-plane.\nSolution: The map � (�) = e� does the trick. (See the Topic 1 notes!)\nYou supply the picture: horizontal lines get mapped to rays from the origin and vertical segments\nin the channel get mapped to semicircles.\nExample 10.31.

Find a conformal map from � to the upper\nhalf-plane.\nSolution: The map � -1(�) maps � to the second quadrant. Then multiplying by -� maps this to the\nfirst quadrant. Then squaring maps this to the upper half-plane. In the end we have\n(\n(\n))2\n�� + �\n� (�) = -�\n.\n-� + 1\nYou supply the sequence of pictures.\nExample 10.33.

      "content": "Topic 11 Notes\nJeremy Orloff\n11 Argument Principle\n11.1 Introduction\nThe argument principle (or principle of the argument) is a consequence of the residue theorem. It\nconnects the winding number of a curve with the number of zeros and poles inside the curve. This\nis useful for applications (mathematical and otherwise) where we want to know the location of zeros\nand poles.\n11.2 Principle of the argument\nSetup.\n� a simple closed curve, oriented in a counterclockwise direction.\n� (�) analytic on and inside �, except for (possibly) some finite poles inside (not on) � and some zeros\ninside (not on) �.\nLet �1, ... , �� be the poles of � inside �.\nLet �1, ... , �� be the zeros of � inside �.\nWrite mult(��) = the multiplicity of the zero at ��. Likewise write mult(��) = the order of the pole\nat ��.\nWe start with a theorem that will lead to the argument principle.\nTheorem 11.1. With the above setup\n(∑\n∑\n)\n� ′(�) �� = 2��\nmult(��) -\nmult(��) .\n∫� � (�)\nProof. To prove this theorem we need to understand the poles and residues of � ′(�)∕� (�). With this\nin mind, suppose � (�) has a zero of order � at �0. The Taylor series for � (�) near �0 is\n� (�) = (� - �0)��(�)\nwhere �(�) is analytic and never 0 on a small neighborhood of �0. This implies\n� ′(�)\n�(� - �0)�-1�(�) + (� - �0)�� ′(�)\n=\n� (�)\n(� - �0)��(�)\n�\n� ′(�)\n= � - �0\n+ �(�)\nSince �(�) is never 0, � ′(�)∕�(�) is analytic near �0. This implies that �0 is a simple pole of\n� ′(�)∕� (�) and\n(\n)\n� ′(�)\nRes\n, �0\n= � = mult(�0).\n� (�)\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nLikewise, if �0 is a pole of order � then the Laurent series for � (�) near �0 is\n� (�) = (� - �0)-��(�)\nwhere �(�) is analytic and never 0 on a small neighborhood of �0. Thus,\n� ′(�)\n�(� - �0)-�-1�(�) + (� - �0)-�� ′(�)\n= -\n� (�)\n(� - �0)-��(�)\n�\n� ′(�)\n= -\n+\n� - �0\n�(�)\nAgain we have that �0 is a simple pole of � ′(�)∕� (�) and\n(\n)\n� ′(�)\nRes\n, �0\n= -� = -mult(�0).\n� (�)\nThe theorem now follows immediately from the Residue Theorem:\n� ′(�) �� = 2��sum of the residues\n∫� � (�)\n(∑\n∑\n)\n= 2��\nmult(��) -\nmult(��) .\nDefinition. We write �� ,� for the sum of multiplicities of the zeros of � inside �. Likewise for �� ,� .\nSo the Theorem 11.1 says,\n′\n�� = 2�� �� ,� - �� ,� .\n(1)\n�\n∫�\n�\n(\n)\nDefinition. Winding number. We have an intuition for what this means. We define it formally via\nCauchy's formula. If � is a closed curve then its winding number (or index) about �0 is defined as\nInd(�, �0) =\n��.\n2�� ∫� � - �0\n(In class I'll draw some pictures. You should draw a few now.)\n11.2.1 Mapping curves: � *�\nOne of the key notions in this topic is mapping one curve to another. That is, if � = �(�) is a curve\nand � = � (�) is a function, then � = � *�(�) = � (�(�)) is another curve. We say � maps � to � *�.\nWe have done this frequently in the past, but it is important enough to us now, so that we will stop\nhere and give a few examples. This is a key concept in the argument principle and you should make\nsure you are very comfortable with it.\nExample 11.2. Let �(�) = e�� with 0 ≤ � ≤ 2� (the unit circle). Let � (�) = �2. Describe the curve\n� *�.\nSolution: Clearly � *�(�) = e2�� traverses the unit circle twice as � goes from 0 to 2�.\nExample 11.3. Let �(�) = �� with -inf < � < inf (the �-axis). Let � (�) = 1∕(� + 1). Describe the\ncurve � *�(�).\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nSolution: � (�) is a fractional linear transformation and maps the line given by � to the circle through\nthe origin centered at 1∕2. By checking at a few points:\n1 + �\n1 - �\n� (-�) =\n=\n,\n� (0) = 1,\n� (�) =\n=\n,\n� (inf) = 0.\n-� + 1\n� + 1\nWe see that the circle is traversed in a clockwise manner as � goes from -inf to inf.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\ni = γ(1)\n-i = γ(-1)\nγ(t) = it\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n1 = f(0)\nf(-i)\nf(i)\nf(inf)\n1/2\nf *γ(t) = 1/(1 + it)\nw = f(z) =\nz+1\nThe curve � = �(�) = �� is mapped to � = � *�(�)) = 1∕(�� + 1).\n11.2.2 Argument principle\nYou will also see this called the principle of the argument.\nTheorem 11.4. Argument principle. For � and � with the same setup as above\n� ′(�)\n∫� � (�) �� = 2�� Ind(� *�, 0) = 2��(�� ,� - �� ,� )\n(2)\nProof. Theorem 11.1 showed that\n� ′(�)\n∫� � (�) �� = 2��(��,� - ��,� )\nSo we need to show is that the integral also equals the winding number given. This is simply the\nchange of variables � = � (�). With this change of variables the countour � = �(�) becomes � =\n� *�(�) and �� = � ′(�) �� so\n� ′(�)\n��\n�� = ∫� *�\n= 2�� Ind(� *�, 0)\n∫� � (�)\n�\nThe last equality in the above equation comes from the definition of winding number.\nNote that by assumption � does not go through any zeros of � , so � = � (�(�)) is never zero and 1∕�\nin the integral is not a problem.\nHere is an easy corollary to the argument principle that will be useful to us later.\nCorollary. Assuming that � *� does not go through -1, i.e. there are no zeros of 1 + � (�) on � then\n′\n�\n= 2�� Ind(� *�, -1) = 2��(�1+� ,� - �� ,� ).\n(3)\n� + 1\n∫�\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nProof. Applying the argument principle in Equation 2 to the function 1 + � (�), we get\n(1 + � )′(�)\n∫� 1 + � (�) �� = 2�� Ind(1 + � *�, 0) = 2��(�1+� ,� - �1+� ,� )\nNow, we can compare each of the terms in this equation to those in Equation 3:\n(1 + � )′(�)\n� ′(�)\n�� = ∫�\n��\n(because (1 + � )′ = � ′)\n∫� 1 + � (�)\n1 + � (�)\nInd(1 + � *�, 0) = Ind(� *�, -1)\n(1 + � winds around 0 ⇔ � winds around -1)\n�1+� ,� = �1+� ,�\n(same in both equations)\n�1+� ,� = �� ,�\n(poles of � = poles of 1 + � )\nExample 11.5. Let � (�) = �2+� Find the winding number of � *� around 0 for each of the following\ncurves.\n1. �1 = circle of radius 2.\n2. �2 = circle of radius 1/2.\n3. �3 = circle of radius 1.\nanswers. � (�) has zeros at 0, -1. It has no poles.\nSo, � has no poles and two zeros inside �1. The argument principle says Ind(� *�1, 0) = ��,�1 -\n�� ,� = 2\nLikewise � has no poles and one zero inside �2, so Ind(� *�2, 0) = 1 -0 = 1\nFor �3 a zero of � is on the curve, i.e. � (-1) = 0, so the argument principle doesn't apply.

Rouches theorem. Make the following assumptions:\n� is a simple closed curve\n\n|||\n|||\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\n�, h are analytic functions on and inside �, except for some finite poles.\nThere are no poles of � and h on �.\n|h| < |� | everywhere on �.\nThen\nInd(� *�, 0) = Ind((� + h)*�, 0).\nThat is,\n�� ,� - �� ,� = �� +h,� - �� +h,�\n(4)\nProof. In class we gave a heuristic proof involving a person walking a dog around � *� on a leash of\nlength h*�. Here is the analytic proof.\nThe argument principle requires the function to have no zeros or poles on �. So we first show that\nthis is true of � , � + h, (� + h)∕� . The argument is goes as follows.\nZeros: The fact that 0 ≤ |h| < |� | on � implies � has no zeros on �. It also implies � + h has no\nzeros on �, since the value of h is never big enough to cancel that of � . Since � and � + h have no\nzeros, neither does (� + h)∕� .\nPoles: By assumption � and h have no poles on �, so � + h has no poles there. Since � has no zeros\non �, (� + h)∕� has no poles there.\nNow we can apply the argument principle to � and � + h\n′\n�\n�� = Ind(� *�, 0) = �� ,� - �� ,� .\n(5)\n2�� ∫� �\n(� + h)′\n�� = Ind((� + h)*�, 0) = �� +h,� - �� +h,�.\n(6)\n2�� ∫� � + h\n(\n)\nh\nh\n� + h\nNext, by assumption\n< 1, so\n*� is inside the unit circle. . This means that 1+ h =\n|� |\n�\n�\n�\nmaps � to the inside of the unit disk centered at 1. (You should draw a figure for this.) This implies\nthat\n((\n)\n)\n� + h\nInd\n*�, 0 = 0.\n�\n� + h\n� ′\nLet � =\n. The above says Ind(�*�, 0) = 0. So, ∫�\n�� = 0. (We showed above that � has\n�\n�\nno zeros or poles on �.)\n′\n(� + h)′\n�\nNow, it's easy to compute that � ′\n=\n-\n. So, using\n�\n� + h\n�\n′\n� ′\n(� + h)′\n�\nInd(�*�, 0) = ∫�\n�� = ∫�\n�� - ∫�\n�� = 0 ⇒ Ind((� + h)*�, 0) = Ind(� *�, 0).\n�\n� + h\n�\nNow equations 5 and 6 tell us ��,� - �� ,� = �� +h,� - �� +h,� , i.e. we have proved Rouches theorem.\nCorollary. Under the same hypotheses, If h and � are analytic (no poles) then\n�� ,� = �� +h,�.\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nProof. Since the functions are analytic �� ,� and �� +h,� are both 0. So Equation 4 shows �� = �� +h.\nQED.\nWe think of h as a small perturbation of � .\nExample 11.7. Show all 5 zeros of �5 + 3� + 1 are inside the curve �2 ∶ |�| = 2.\nSolution: Let � (�) = �5 and h(�) = 3� +1. Clearly all 5 roots of � (really one root with multiplicity\n5) are inside �2. Also clearly, |h| < 7 < 32 = |� | on �2. The corollary to Rouches theorem says all\n5 roots of � + h = �5 + 3� + 1 must also be inside the curve.\nExample 11.8. Show � + 3 + 2e� has one root in the left half-plane.\nSolution: Let � (�) = � + 3, h(�) = 2e�. Consider the contour from -�� to �� along the �-axis and\nthen the left semicircle of radius � back to -��. That is, the contour �1 + �� shown below.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\niR\n-iR\nCR\nC1\nTo apply the corollary to Rouches theorem we need to check that (for � large) |h| < |� | on �1 + ��.\nOn �1, � = ��, so\n|� (�)| = |3 + ��| ≥ 3,\n|h(�)| = 2|e��| = 2.\nSo |h| < |� | on �1.\nOn ��, � = � + �� with � < 0 and |�| = �. So,\n|� (�)| > � -3 for � large,\n|h(�)| = 2|e�+��| = 2e� < 2 (since � < 0).\nSo |h| < |� | on ��.\nThe only zero of � is at � = -3, which lies inside the contour.\nTherefore, by the Corollary to Rouches theorem, � + h has the same number of roots as � inside\nthe contour, that is 1. Now let � go to infinity and we see that � + h has only one root in the entire\nhalf-plane.\nTheorem. Fundamental theorem of algebra.\nRouches theorem can be used to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra as follows.\nProof. Let\n� (�) = �� + ��-1��-1 + ... + �0\nbe an �th order polynomial. Let � (�) = �� and h = � - � . Choose an � such that � >\nmax(1, �|��-1|, ... , �|�0|). Then on |�| = � we have\n�\n�\n��-1 +\n��-2 + ... +\n< ��\n|h| ≤ |��-1|��-1 + |��-2|��-2 + ... + |�0| ≤ �\n.\n�\n�\n�\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nOn |�| = � we have |� (�)| = ��, so we have shown |h| < |� | on the curve. Thus, the corollary to\nRouches theorem says � + h and � have the same number of zeros inside |�| = �. Since we know\n� has exactly � zeros inside the curve the same is true for the polynomial � + h. Now let � go to\ninfinity, we've shown that � + h has exactly � zeros in the entire plane.\nNote. The proof gives a simple bound on the size of the zeros: they are all have magnitude less than\nor equal to max(1, �|��-1|, ... , �|�0|).\n11.3 Nyquist criterion for stability\nThe Nyquist criterion is a graphical technique for telling whether an unstable linear time invariant\nsystem can be stabilized using a negative feedback loop. We will look a little more closely at such\nsystems when we study the Laplace transform in the next topic. For this topic we will content\nourselves with a statement of the problem with only the tiniest bit of physical context.\nNote. You have already encountered linear time invariant systems in 18.03 (or its equivalent) when\nyou solved constant coefficient linear differential equations.\n11.3.1 System functions\nA linear time invariant system has a system function which is a function of a complex variable.\nTypically, the complex variable is denoted by � and a capital letter is used for the system function.\nLet �(�) be such a system function. We will make a standard assumption that �(�) is meromorphic\nwith a finite number of (finite) poles. This assumption holds in many interesting cases. For example,\nquite often �(�) is a rational function �(�)∕� (�) (� and � are polynomials).\nWe will be concerned with the stability of the system.\nDefinition. The system with system function �(�) is called stable if all the poles of � are in the left\nhalf-plane. That is, if all the poles of � have negative real part.\nThe system is called unstable if any poles are in the right half-plane, i.e. have positive real part.\nFor the edge case where no poles have positive real part, but some are pure imaginary we will call\nthe system marginally stable. This case can be analyzed using our techniques. For our purposes it\nwould require and an indented contour along the imaginary axis. If we have time we will do the\nanalysis.\n�\nExample 11.9. Is the system with system function �(�) =\nstable?\n(� + 2)(�2 + 4� + 5)\nSolution: The poles are -2, -2 ± �. Since they are all in the left half-plane, the system is stable.\n�\nExample 11.10. Is the system with system function �(�) =\nstable?\n(�2 - 4)(�2 + 4� + 5)\nSolution: The poles are ±2, -2 ± �. Since one pole is in the right half-plane, the system is unstable.\n�\nExample 11.11. Is the system with system function �(�) =\nstable?\n(� + 2)(�2 + 4)\nSolution: The poles are -2, ±2�. There are no poles in the right half-plane. Since there are poles on\nthe imaginary axis, the system is marginally stable.\nTerminology. So far, we have been careful to say 'the system with system function �(�)'. From\nnow on we will allow ourselves to be a little more casual and say 'the system �(�)'. It is perfectly\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nclear and rolls off the tongue a little easier!\n11.3.2 Pole-zero diagrams\nWe can visualize �(�) using a pole-zero diagram. This is a diagram in the �-plane where we put a\nsmall cross at each pole and a small circle at each zero.\nExample 11.12. Give zero-pole diagrams for each of the systems\n�\n�\n�\n�1(�) =\n,\n�2(�) =\n,\n�3(�) =\n(� + 2)(�2 + 4� + 5)\n(�2 - 4)(�2 + 4� + 5)\n(� + 2)(�2 + 4)\nSolution: These are the same systems as in the examples just above. We first note that they all have\na single zero at the origin. So we put a circle at the origin and a cross at each pole.\nRe(s)\nIm(s)\nx\nx\nx\nG1(s)\ni\nRe(s)\nIm(s)\nx\nx\nx\nx\nG2(s)\ni\nRe(s)\nIm(s)\nx\nx\nx\nG3(s)\ni\nPole-zero diagrams for the three systems.\n11.3.3 A bit about stability\nThis is just to give you a little physical orientation. Given our definition of stability above, we could,\nin principle, discuss stability without the slightest idea what it means for physical systems.\nThe poles of �(�) correspond to what are called modes of the system. A simple pole at �1 corresponds\nto a mode �1(�) = e�1�. The system is stable if the modes all decay to 0, i.e. if the poles are all in the\nleft half-plane.\nPhysically the modes tell us the behavior of the system when the input signal is 0, but there are\ninitial conditions. A pole with positive real part would correspond to a mode that goes to infinity as\n� grows. It is certainly reasonable to call a system that does this in response to a zero signal (often\ncalled 'no input') unstable.\nTo connect this to 18.03: if the system is modeled by a differential equation, the modes correspond\nto the homogeneous solutions �(�) = e��, where � is a root of the characteristic equation. In 18.03 we\ncalled the system stable if every homogeneous solution decayed to 0. That is, if the unforced system\nalways settled down to equilibrium.\n11.3.4 Closed loop systems\nIf the system with system function �(�) is unstable it can sometimes be stabilized by what is called a\nnegative feedback loop. The new system is called a closed loop system. Its system function is given\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nby Black's formula\n�(�)\n���(�) =\n(7)\n1 + ��(�),\nwhere � is called the feedback factor. We will just accept this formula. Any class or book on control\ntheory will derive it for you.\nIn this context �(�) is called the open loop system function.\nSince ��� is a system function, we can ask if the system is stable.\nTheorem. The poles of the closed loop system function ���(�) given in Equation 7 are the zeros\nof 1 + ��(�).\nProof. Looking at Equation 7, there are two possible sources of poles for ���.\n1. The zeros of the denominator 1 + ��. The theorem recognizes these.\n2. The poles of �. Since � is in both the numerator and denominator of ��� it should be clear that\nthe poles cancel. We can show this formally using Laurent series. If � has a pole of order � at �0\nthen\n(\n)\n�(�) =\n�� + ��-1(� - �0) + ... �0(� - �0)� + �1(� - �0)�+1 + ... ,\n(� - �0)�\nwhere �� = 0. So,\n(\n)\n�� + ��-1(� - �0) + ... �0(� - �0)� + ...\n(�-�0)�\n���(�) =\n(\n)\n�\n1 +\n�� + ��-1(� - �0) + ... �0(� - �0)� + ...\n(�-�0)�\n(\n)\n�� + ��-1(� - �0) + ... �0(� - �0)� + ...\n=\n(\n),\n(� - �0)� + � �� + ��-1(� - �0) + ... �0(� - �0)� + ...\nwhich is clearly analytic at �0. (At �0 it equals ��∕(���) = 1∕�.)\nExample 11.13. Set the feedback factor � = 1. Assume � is real, for what values of � is the open\nloop system �(�) =\nstable? For what values of � is the corresponding closed loop system\n� + �\n���(�) stable?\n(There is no particular reason that � needs to be real in this example. But in physical systems,\ncomplex poles will tend to come in conjugate pairs.)\nSolution: �(�) has one pole at � = -�. Thus, it is stable when the pole is in the left half-plane, i.e.\nfor � > 0.\nThe closed loop system function is\n1∕(� + �)\n=\n���(�) = 1 + 1∕(� + �)\n� + � + 1.\nThis has a pole at � = -� -1, so it's stable if � > -1. The feedback loop has stabilized the unstable\nopen loop systems with -1 < � ≤ 0. (Actually, for � = 0 the open loop is marginally stable, but it\nis fully stabilized by the closed loop.)\nNote. The algebra involved in canceling the �+� term in the denominators is exactly the cancellation\nthat makes the poles of � removable singularities in ���.\n� + 1\nExample 11.14. Suppose �(�) =\n. Is the open loop system stable? Is the closed loop system\n� -1\nstable when � = 2.\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nSolution: �(�) has a pole in the right half-plane, so the open loop system is not stable. The closed\nloop system function is\n�\n(� + 1)∕(� - 1)\n� + 1\n=\n=\n���(�) = 1 + ��\n1 + 2(� + 1)∕(� -1)\n3� + 1.\nThe only pole is at � = -1∕3, so the closed loop system is stable. This is a case where feedback\nstabilized an unstable system.\n� -1\nExample 11.15. �(�) =\n. Is the open loop system stable? Is the closed loop system stable\n� + 1\nwhen � = 2.\nSolution: The only pole of �(�) is in the left half-plane, so the open loop system is stable. The closed\nloop system function is\n�\n(� - 1)∕(� + 1)\n� -1\n=\n=\n���(�) = 1 + ��\n1 + 2(� - 1)∕(� + 1)\n3� -1.\nThis has one pole at � = 1∕3, so the closed loop system is unstable. This is a case where feedback\ndestabilized a stable system. It can happen!\n11.3.5 Nyquist plot\nFor the Nyquist plot and criterion the curve � will always be the imaginary �-axis. That is\n� = �(�) = ��, where -inf < � < inf.\nFor a system �(�) and a feedback factor �, the Nyquist plot is the plot of the curve\n� = ��*�(�) = ��(��).\nThat is, the Nyquist plot is the image of the imaginary axis under the map � = ��(�).\nNote. In �(�) the variable is a greek omega and in � = �*� we have a double-u.\nExample 11.16. Let �(�) =\n1 . Draw the Nyquist plot with � = 1.\n� + 1\nSolution: In this case �(�) is a fractional linear transformation, so we know it maps the imaginary\naxis to a circle. It is easy to check it is the circle through the origin with center � = 1∕2. You can\nalso check that it is traversed clockwise.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\ns = γ(ω) = iω\n-2i = γ(-2)\n2i = γ(2)\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\nG(0)\nG(2i)\nG(-2i)\nG(inf)\nw = G *γ(ω) =\niω+1\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nNyquist plot of �(�) = 1∕(� + 1), with � = 1.\nExample 11.17. Take �(�) from the previous example. Describe the Nyquist plot with gain factor\n� = 2.\nSolution: The Nyquist plot is the graph of ��(��). The factor � = 2 will scale the circle in the\nprevious example by 2. That is, the Nyquist plot is the circle through the origin with center � = 1.\nIn general, the feedback factor will just scale the Nyquist plot.\n11.3.6 Nyquist criterion\nThe Nyquist criterion gives a graphical method for checking the stability of the closed loop system.\nTheorem 11.18. Nyquist criterion. Suppose that �(�) has a finite number of zeros and poles in\nthe right half-plane. Also suppose that �(�) decays to 0 as � goes to infinity. Then the closed loop\nsystem with feedback factor � is stable if and only if the winding number of the Nyquist plot around\n� = -1 equals the number of poles of �(�) in the right half-plane.\nMore briefly,\n���(�) is stable ⇔ Ind(��*�, -1) = ��,RHP\nHere, � is the imaginary �-axis and ��,RHP is the number of poles of the original open loop system\nfunction �(�) in the right half-plane.\nProof. ��� is stable exactly when all its poles are in the left half-plane. Now, recall that the poles\nof ��� are exactly the zeros of 1 + ��. So, stability of ��� is exactly the condition that the number\nof zeros of 1 + �� in the right half-plane is 0.\nLet's work with a familiar contour.\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\niR\n-iR\nCR\nC1\nxz1\nxz2\nLet �� = �1 + ��. Note that �� is traversed in the clockwise direction. Choose � large enough\nthat the (finite number) of poles and zeros of � in the right half-plane are all inside ��. Now we can\napply Equation 3 in the corollary to the argument principle to ��(�) and � to get\n-Ind(��*��, -1) = �1+��, �� - ��, ��\n(The minus sign is because of the clockwise direction of the curve.) Thus, for all large �\nthe system is stable ⇔ �1+��, �� = 0 ⇔ Ind(��*��, -1) = ��, ��.\nFinally, we can let � go to infinity. The assumption that �(�) decays 0 to as � goes to inf implies\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nthat in the limit, the entire curve ��*�� becomes a single point at the origin. So in the limit ��*��\nbecomes ��*�. QED\n11.3.7 Examples using the Nyquist Plot mathlet\nThe Nyquist criterion is a visual method which requires some way of producing the Nyquist plot.\nFor this we will use one of the MIT Mathlets (slightly modified for our purposes).\nOpen the Nyquist Plot applet at\nhttp://web.mit.edu/jorloff/www/jmoapplets/nyquist/nyquistCrit.html\nPlay with the applet, read the help.\nNow refresh the browser to restore the applet to its original state. Check the Formula box. The\nformula is an easy way to read off the values of the poles and zeros of �(�). In its original state,\napplet should have a zero at � = 1 and poles at � = 0.33 ± 1.75 �.\nThe left hand graph is the pole-zero diagram. The right hand graph is the Nyquist plot.\nExample 11.19. To get a feel for the Nyquist plot. Look at the pole diagram and use the mouse\nto drag the yellow point up and down the imaginary axis. Its image under ��(�) will trace out the\nNyquis plot.\nNotice that when the yellow dot is at either end of the axis its image on the Nyquist plot is close to\n0.\nExample 11.20. Refresh the page, to put the zero and poles back to their original state. There are\ntwo poles in the right half-plane, so the open loop system �(�) is unstable. With � = 1, what is the\nwinding number of the Nyquist plot around -1? Is the closed loop system stable?\nSolution: The curve winds twice around -1 in the counterclockwise direction, so the winding number\nInd(��*�, -1) = 2. Since the number of poles of � in the right half-plane is the same as this winding\nnumber, the closed loop system is stable.\nExample 11.21. With the same poles and zeros, move the � slider and determine what range of �\nmakes the closed loop system stable.\nSolution: When � is small the Nyquist plot has winding number 0 around -1. For these values of �,\n��� is unstable. As � increases, somewhere between � = 0.65 and � = 0.7 the winding number\njumps from 0 to 2 and the closed loop system becomes stable. This continues until � is between 3.10\nand 3.20, at which point the winding number becomes 1 and ��� becomes unstable.\nAnswer: The closed loop system is stable for � (roughly) between 0.7 and 3.10.\nExample 11.22. In the previous problem could you determine analytically the range of � where\n���(�) is stable?\nSolution: Yes! This is possible for small systems. It is more challenging for higher order systems,\nbut there are methods that don't require computing the poles.\nIn this case, we have\n�-1\n�(�)\n(�-0.33)2+1.752\n� -1\n=\n=\n���(�) = 1 + ��(�)\n1 +\n�(�-1)\n(� -0.33)2 + 1.752 + �(� - 1)\n(�-0.33)2+1.752\n\n11 ARGUMENT PRINCIPLE\nSo the poles are the roots of\n(� -0.33)2 + 1.752 + �(� -1) = �2 + (� -0.66)� + 0.332 + 1.752 - �\nFor a quadratic with positive coefficients the roots both have negative real part. This happens when\n0.66 < � < 0.332 + 1.752 ≈3.17.\nExample 11.23. What happens when � goes to 0.\nSolution: As � goes to 0, the Nyquist plot shrinks to a single point at the origin. In this case the\nwinding number around -1 is 0 and the Nyquist criterion says the closed loop system is stable if and\nonly if the open loop system is stable.\nThis should make sense, since with � = 0,\n�\n=\n= �.\n���\n1 + ��\nExample 11.24. Make a system with the following zeros and poles:\nA pair of zeros at 0.6 ± 0.75�\nA pair of poles at -0.5 ± 2.5�.\nA single pole at 0.25.\nIs the corresponding closed loop system stable when � = 6?\nSolution: The answer is no, ��� is not stable. � has one pole in the right half plane. The mathlet\nshows the Nyquist plot winds once around � = -1 in the clockwise direction. So the winding\nnumber is -1, which does not equal the number of poles of � in the right half-plane.\nIf we set � = 3, the closed loop system is stable.\n11.4 A bit on negative feedback\nGiven Equation 7, in 18.04 we can ask if there are any poles in the right half-plane without needing\nany underlying physical model. Still, it's nice to have some sense of where this fits into science and\nengineering.\nIn a negative feedback loop the output of the system is looped back and subtracted from the input.\nExample 11.25. The heating system in my house is an example of a system stabilized by feedback.\nThe thermostat is the feedback mechanism. When the temperature outside (input signal) goes down\nthe heat turns on. Without the thermostat it would stay on and overheat my house. The thermostat\nturns the heat up or down depending on whether the inside temperature (the output signal) is too low\nor too high (negative feedback).\nExample 11.26. Walking or balancing on one foot are examples negative feedback systems. If you\nfeel yourself falling you compensate by shifting your weight or tensing your muscles to counteract\nthe unwanted acceleration.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Topic 12 Notes\nJeremy Orloff\n12 Laplace transform\n12.1 Introduction\nThe Laplace transform takes a function of time and transforms it to a function of a complex variable\n�. Because the transform is invertible, no information is lost and it is reasonable to think of a function\n� (�) and its Laplace transform � (�) as two views of the same phenomenon. Each view has its uses\nand some features of the phenomenon are easier to understand in one view or the other.\nWe can use the Laplace transform to transform a linear time invariant system from the time domain\nto the �-domain. This leads to the system function �(�) for the system -this is the same system\nfunction used in the Nyquist criterion for stability.\nOne important feature of the Laplace transform is that it can transform analytic problems to algebraic\nproblems. We will see examples of this for differential equations.\n12.2 A brief introduction to linear time invariant systems\nLet's start by defining our terms.\nSignal. A signal is any function of time.\nSystem. A system is some machine or procedure that takes one signal as input does something with\nit and produces another signal as output.\nLinear system. A linear system is one that acts linearly on inputs. That is, �1(�) and �2(�) are inputs\nto the system with outputs �1(�) and �2(�) respectively, then the input �1 + �2 produces the output\n�1 + �2 and, for any constant �, the input ��1 produces output ��1.\nThis is often phrased in one sentence as input �1�1 + �2�2 produces output �1�1 + �2�2, i.e. linear\ncombinations of inputs produces a linear combination of the corresponding outputs.\nTime invariance. Suppose a system takes input signal � (�) and produces output signal �(�). The\nsystem is called time invariant if the input signal �(�) = � (� - �) produces output signal �(� - �).\nLTI. We will call a linear time invariant system an LTI system.\nExample 12.1. Consider the constant coefficient differential equation\n3� ′′ + 8� ′ + 7� = � (�)\nThis equation models a damped harmonic oscillator, say a mass on a spring with a damper, where\n� (�) is the force on the mass and �(�) is its displacement from equilibrium. If we consider � to be\nthe input and � the output, then this is a linear time invariant (LTI) system.\nExample 12.2. There are many variations on this theme. For example, we might have the LTI system\n3� ′′ + 8� ′ + 7� = � ′(�),\nwhere we call � (�) the input signal and �(�) the output signal.\n\n|||\n|||\n|||\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\n12.3 Laplace transform\nDefinition. The Laplace transform of a function � (�) is defined by the integral\ninf\n(� ; �) = ∫\ne-��� (�) ��,\nfor those � where the integral converges. Here � is allowed to take complex values.\nImportant note. The Laplace transform is only concerned with � (�) for � ≥ 0. Generally, speaking\nwe can require � (�) = 0 for � < 0.\nStandard notation. Where the notation is clear, we will use an upper case letter to indicate the\nLaplace transform, e.g, (� ; �) = � (�).\nThe Laplace transform we defined is sometimes called the one-sided Laplace transform. There is a\ntwo-sided version where the integral goes from -inf to inf.\n12.3.1 First examples\nLet's compute a few examples. We will also put these results in the Laplace transform table at the\nend of these notes.\ne��\nExample 12.3. Let � (�) =\n. Compute � (�) = (� ; �) directly. Give the region in the complex\n�-plane where the integral converges.\n(e��; �) = ∫\ninf\ne��e\ninf\ne(�-�)� inf\n-�� �� = ∫\ne(�-�)� �� =\n{\n� - � |\nif Re(�) > Re(�)\n�-�\n=\ndivergent\notherwise\nThe last formula comes from plugging inf into the exponential. This is 0 if Re(� - �) < 0 and\nundefined otherwise.\nExample 12.4. Let � (�) = �. Compute � (�) = (� ; �) directly.

This is 0 if Re(-�) < 0 and undefined\notherwise.\nExample 12.5. Let � (�) = �. Compute � (�) = (� ; �) directly. Give the region in the complex\n�-plane where the integral converges.\ninf\ninf\n�e-��\n- e-��\n(�; �) = ∫\n�e\n=\n-�\n�2 |0\n-�� ��\n{ 1\nif Re(�) > 0\n�2\n=\ndivergent\notherwise\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nExample 12.6. Compute\n(cos(��)).\nSolution: We use the formula\ne��� + e-���\ncos(��) =\n.\n1∕(� - ��) + 1∕(� + ��)\n�\nSo,\n(cos(��); �) =\n=\n�2 + �2 .\n12.3.2 Connection to Fourier transform\nThe Laplace and Fourier transforms are intimately connected. In fact, the Laplace transform is often\ncalled the Fourier-Laplace transform. To see the connection we'll start with the Fourier transform\nof a function � (�).\ninf\n�(�) = ∫\n� (�)e-��� ��.\n-inf\nIf we assume � (�) = 0 for � < 0, this becomes\ninf\n�(�) = ∫\n� (�)e-��� ��.\n(1)\nNow if � = �� then the Laplace transform is\ninf\n(� ; �) = (� ; ��) = ∫\n� (�)e-��� ��\n(2)\nComparing these two equations we see that �(�) = (� ; ��). We see the transforms are basically\nthe same things using different notation -at least for functions that are 0 for � < 0.\n12.4 Exponential type\nThe Laplace transform is defined when the integral for it converges. Functions of exponential type\nare a class of functions for which the integral converges for all � with Re(�) large enough.\nDefinition. We say that � (�) has exponential type � if there exists an � such that |� (�)| < �e�� for\nall � ≥ 0.\nNote. As we've defined it, the exponential type of a function is not unique. For example, a function\nof exponential type 2 is clearly also of exponential type 3. It's nice, but not always necessary, to find\nthe smallest exponential type for a function.\nTheorem. If � has exponential type � then (� ) converges absolutely for Re(�) > �.\nProof. We prove absolute convergence by bounding\n|� (�)e-��|.\n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nThe key here is that Re(�) > � implies Re(� - �) < 0. So, we can write\ninf\ninf\ninf\n|� (�)e-��| �� ≤∫\n|�e(�-�)�| �� = ∫\n�eRe(�-�)� ��\n∫0\nThe last integral clearly converges when Re(� - �) < 0. QED\nExample 12.7. Here is a list of some functions of exponential type.\n� (�) = e�� ∶\n< 2eRe(�)�\n� (�)\n(exponential type Re(�))\n� (�) = 1 ∶\n� (�) < 2 = 2e0⋅� (exponential type 0)\n� (�) = cos(��) ∶ |� (�)| ≤ 1\n(exponential type 0)\nIn the above, all of the inequalities are for � ≥ 0.\nFor � (�) = �, it is clear that for any � > 0 there is an � depending on � such that |� (�)| ≤ �e��\nfor � ≥ 0. In fact, it is a simple calculus exercise to show � = 1∕(��) works. So, � (�) = � has\nexponential type � for any � > 0.\nThe same is true of ��. It's worth pointing out that this follows because, if � has exponential type �\nand � has exponential type � then � � has exponential type � + �. So, if � has exponential type � then\n�� has exponential type ��.\n12.5 Properties of Laplace transform\nWe have already used the linearity of Laplace transform when we computed (cos(��)). Let's offi\ncially record it as a property.\nProperty 1. The Laplace transform is linear. That is, if � and � are constants and � and � are\nfunctions then\n(�� + ��) = �(� ) + �(�).\n(3)\n(The proof is trivial -integration is linear.)\nProperty 2. A key property of the Laplace transform is that, with some technical details,\nLaplace transform transforms derivatives in � to multiplication by � (plus some details).\nThis is proved in the following theorem.\nTheorem. If � (�) has exponential type � and Laplace transform � (�) then\n(� ′(�); �) = �� (�) - � (0), valid for Re(�) > �.\n(4)\nProof. We prove this using integration by parts.\ninf\ninf\n′(�)e-�� �� = � (�)e-�� inf\n(� ′; �) = ∫\n�\n|0 + ∫\n�� (�)e-�� �� = -� (0) + �� (�).\ninf, � (�)e-��\nIn the last step we used the fact that at � =\n= 0, which follows from the assumption\nabout exponential type.\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nEquation 4 gives us formulas for all derivatives of � .\n(� ′′; �) = �2� (�) - �� (0) - � ′(0)\n(5)\n(� ′′′; �) = �3� (�) - �2� (0) - �� ′(0) - � ′′(0)\n(6)\nProof. For Equation 5:\n(� ′′; �) = ((� ′)′; �) = �(� ′; �)-� ′(0) = � (�� (�) - � (0))-� ′(0) = �2� (�)-�� (0)-� ′(0). QED\nThe proof Equation 6 is similar. Also, similar statements hold for higher order derivatives.\nNote. There is a further complication if we want to consider functions that are discontinuous at the\norigin or if we want to allow � (�) to be a generalized function like �(�). In these cases � (0) is not\ndefined, so our formulas are undefined. The technical fix is to replace 0 by 0- in the definition and\nall of the formulas for Laplace transform. You can learn more about this by taking 18.031.\nProperty 3. Theorem. If � (�) has exponential type �, then � (�) is an analytic function for Re(�) > �\nand\n� ′(�) = -(�� (�); �).\n(7)\nProof. We take the derivative of � (�). The absolute convergence for Re(�) large guarantees that we\ncan interchange the order of integration and taking the derivative.\ninf\ninf\n�\n� ′(�) =\n� (�)e-�� �� = ∫\n-�� (�)e-�� �� = (-�� (�); �).\n�� ∫0\nThis proves Equation 7.\nEquation 7 is called the �-derivative rule. We can extend it to more derivatives in �: Suppose\n(� ; �) = � (�). Then,\n(�� (�); �) = -� ′(�)\n(8)\n(��� (�); �) = (-1)�� (�)(�)\n(9)\nEquation 8 is the same as Equation 7 above. Equation 9 follows from this.\nExample 12.8. Use the s-derivative rule and the formula (1; �) = 1∕� to compute the Laplace\ntransform of �� for � a positive integer.\nSolution: Let � (�) = 1 and � (�) = (� ; �). Using the s-derivative rule we get\n(�; �) = (�� ; �) = -� ′(�) = �2\n(�2; �) = (�2� ; �) = (-1)2� ′′(�) = �3\n�!\n(��; �) = (��� ; �) = (-1)�� �(�) = ��+1\nProperty 4. �-shift rule. As usual, assume � (�) = 0 for � < 0. Suppose � > 0. Then,\n(� (� - �); �) = e-��� (�)\n(10)\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nProof. We go back to the definition of the Laplace transform and make the change of variables\n� = � - �.\ninf\ninf\n(� (� - �); �) = ∫\n� (� - �)e-�� �� = ∫\n� (� - �)e-�� ��\n�\ninf\ninf\n= ∫\n� (�)e-�(�+�) �� = e-��\n∫\n� (�)e-�� �� = e-��� (�).\nThe properties in Equations 3-10 will be used in examples below. They are also in the table at the\nend of these notes.\n12.6 Differential equations\nCoverup method. We are going to use partial fractions and the coverup method. We will assume\nyou have seen partial fractions. If you don't remember them well or have never seen the coverup\nmethod, you should read the note Partial fractions and the coverup method posted with the class\nnotes.\nExample 12.9. Solve � ′′ - � = e2�, �(0) = 1, � ′(0) = 1 using Laplace transform.\nSolution: Call (�) = � . Apply the Laplace transform to the equation gives\n(�2� - ��(0) - � ′(0)) - � =\n� -2\nA little bit of algebra now gives\n(�2 -1)� =\n+ � + 1.\n� -2\nSo\n� + 1\n� =\n+\n=\n+\n(� - 2)(�2 -1)\n�2 -1\n(� - 2)(�2 -1)\n� -1\nUse partial fractions to write\n�\n�\n�\n� =\n+\n+\n+\n� -2\n� -1\n� + 1\n� -1.\nThe coverup method gives � = 1∕3, � = -1∕2, � = 1∕6.\nWe recognize\n� - �\nas the Laplace transform of e��, so\n�(�) = �e2� + �e� + �e-� + e� = 1e2� - 1e� + 1e-� + e�.\nExample 12.10. Solve � ′′ - � = 1, �(0) = 0, � ′(0) = 0.\nSolution: The rest (zero) initial conditions are nice because they will not add any terms to the algebra.\nAs in the previous example we apply the Laplace transform to the entire equation.\n�\n�\n�\n�2� - � = , so � =\n=\n=\n+\n+\n�\n�(�2 -1)\n�(� - 1)(� + 1)\n�\n� -1\n� + 1\nThe coverup method gives � = -1, � = 1∕2, � = 1∕2. So,\n� = � + �e� + �e-� = -1 + 1\n2e� + 2\n1e-�.\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\n12.7 System functions and the Laplace transform\nWhen we introduced the Nyquist criterion for stability we stated without any justification that the\nsystem was stable if all the poles of the system function �(�)were in the left half-plane. We also\nasserted that the poles corresponded to exponential modes of the system. In this section we'll use\nthe Laplace transform to more fully develop these ideas for differential equations.\n12.7.1 Lightning review of 18.03\nDefinitions.\n�\n1. � =\nis called a differential operator. Applied to a function � (�) we have\n��\n��\n�� =\n.\n��\nWe read �� as '� applied to � .'\nExample 12.11. If � (�) = �3 + 2 then �� = 3�2, �2� = 6�.\n2. If � (�) is a polynomial then � (�) is called a polynomial differential operator.\nExample 12.12. Suppose � (�) = �2 + 8� + 7. What is � (�)? Compute � (�) applied to � (�) =\n�3 + 2� + 5. Compute � (�) applied to �(�) = e2�.\nSolution: � (�) = �2 + 8� + 7�. (The � in 7� is the identity operator.) To compute � (�)� we\ncompute all the terms and sum them up:\n� (�) = �3 + 2� + 5\n�� (�) = 3�2 + 2\n�2� (�) = 6�\nTherefore: (�2 + 8� + 7�)� = 6� + 8(3�2 + 2) + 7(�3 + 2� + 5) = 7�3 + 24�2 + 20� + 51.\n�(�) = e2�\n��(�) = 2e2�\n�2�(�) = 4e2�\nTherefore: (�2 + 8� + 7�)� = 4e2� + 8(2)e2� + 7e2� = (4 + 16 + 7)e2� = � (2)e2�.\nThe substitution rule is a straightforward statement about the derivatives of exponentials.\nTheorem 12.13. (Substitution rule) For a polynomial differential operator � (�) we have\n� (�)e�� = � (�)e�� .\n(11)\nProof. This is obvious. We 'prove it' by example. Let � (�) = �2 + 8� + 7�. Then\n� (�)��� = �2e�� + 8�e�� + 7e��\n= � (�)e��\n= (�2 + 8� + 7)e��\n.\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nLet's continue to work from this specific example. From it we'll be able to remind you of the general\napproach to solving constant coefficient differential equations.\nExample 12.14. Suppose � (�) = �2+8�+7. Find the exponential modes of the equation � (�)� = 0.\nSolution: The exponential modes are solutions of the form �(�) = e�0�. Using the substititution rule\n� (�)e�0� = 0 ⇔ � (�0) = 0.\nThat is, �(�) = e�0� is a mode exactly when �0 is a root of � (�). The roots of � (�) are -1, -7. So the\nmodal solutions are\n-�\n-7�\n�1(�) = e\nand �2(�) = e\n.\nExample 12.15. Redo the previous example using the Laplace transform.\nSolution: For this we solve the differential equation with arbitrary initial conditions:\n� (�)� = � ′′ + 8� ′ + 7� = 0;\n�(0) = �1, � ′(0) = �2.\nLet � (�) = (�; �). Applying the Laplace transform to the equation we get\n(�2� (�) - ��(0) - � ′(0)) + 8(�� (�) - �(0)) + 7� (�) = 0\nAlgebra:\n��1 + 8�1 + �2\n(�2 + 8� + 7)� (�) - ��1 - �2 -8�1 = 0 ⇔ � = �2 + 8� + 7\nFactoring the denominator and using partial fractions, we get\n��1 + 8�1 + �2\n��1 + 8�1 + �2\n�\n�\n� (�) =\n=\n=\n+\n�2 + 8� + 7\n(� + 1)(� + 7)\n� + 1\n� + 7.\nWe are unconcerned with the exact values of � and �. Taking the Laplace inverse we get\n-� + �e-7�\n�(�) = �e\n.\nThat is, �(�) is a linear combination of the exponential modes.\nYou should notice that the denominator in the expression for � (�) is none other than the characteristic\npolynomial � (�).\n12.7.2 The system function\nExample 12.16. With the same � (�) as in Example 12.12 solve the inhomogeneous DE with rest\ninitial conditions: � (�)� = � (�), �(0) = 0, � ′(0) = 0.\nSolution: Taking the Laplace transform of the equation we get\n� (�)� (�) = � (�).\nTherefore\n� (�) =\n� (�)\n� (�)\nWe can't find �(�) explicitly because � (�) isn't specified.\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nBut, we can make the following definitions and observations. Let �(�) = 1∕� (�). If we declare �\nto be the input and � the output of this linear time invariant system, then �(�) is called the system\nfunction. So, we have\n� (�) = �(�) ⋅ � (�).\n(12)\nThe formula � = � ⋅ � can be phrased as\noutput = system function × input.\nNote well, the roots of � (�) correspond to the exponential modes of the system, i.e. the poles of\n�(�) correspond to the exponential modes.\nThe system is called stable if the modes all decay to 0 as � goes to infinity. That is, if all the poles\nhave negative real part.\nExample 12.17. This example is to emphasize that not all system functions are of the form 1∕� (�).\nConsider the system modeled by the differential equation\n� (�)� = �(�)� ,\nwhere � and � are polynomials. Suppose we consider � to be the input and � to be the ouput. Find\nthe system function.\nSolution: If we start with rest initial conditions for � and � then the Laplace transform gives\n� (�)�(�) = �(�)� (�) or\n�(�)\n�(�) =\n⋅ � (�)\n� (�)\nUsing the formulation\noutput = system function × input,\nwe see that the system function is\n�(�)\n�(�) = � (�) .\nNote that when � (�) = 0 the differential equation becomes � (�)� = 0. If we make the assumption\nthat the �(�)∕� (�) is in reduced form, i.e. � and � have no common zeros, then the modes of the\nsystem (which correspond to the roots of � (�)) are still the poles of the system function.\nComments. All LTI systems have system functions. They are not even all of the form �(�)∕� (�).\nBut, in the �-domain, the output is always the system function times the input. If the system function\nis not rational then it may have an infinite number of poles. Stability is harder to characterize, but\nunder some reasonable assumptions the system will be stable if all the poles are in the left half-plane.\nThe system function is also called the transfer function. You can think of it as describing how the\nsystem transfers the input to the output.\n12.8 Laplace inverse\nUp to now we have computed the inverse Laplace transform by table lookup. For example, -1(1∕(�-\n�)) = e��. To do this properly we should first check that the Laplace transform has an inverse.\nWe start with the bad news: Unfortunately this is not strictly true. There are many functions with\nthe same Laplace transform. We list some of the ways this can happen.\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\n1. If � (�) = �(�) for � ≥ 0, then clearly � (�) = �(�). Since the Laplace transform only concerns\n� ≥ 0, the functions can differ completely for � < 0.\n2. Suppose � (�) = e�� and\n{\n� (�)\nfor � = 1\n�(�) =\n.\nfor � = 1.\nThat is, � and � are the same except we arbitrarily assigned them different values at � = 1. Then,\nsince the integrals won't notice the difference at one point, � (�) = �(�) = 1∕(� - �). In this sense\nit is impossible to define -1(� ) uniquely.\nThe good news is that the inverse exists as long as we consider two functions that only differ on a\nnegligible set of points the same. In particular, we can make the following claim.\nTheorem. Suppose � and � are continuous and � (�) = �(�) for all � with Re(�) > � for some �.\nThen � (�) = �(�) for � ≥ 0.\nThis theorem can be stated in a way that includes piecewise continuous functions. Such a statement\ntakes more care, which would obscure the basic point that the Laplace transform has a unique inverse\nup to some, for us, trivial differences.\nWe start with a few examples that we can compute directly.\nExample 12.18. Let\n� (�) = e�� .\nSo,\n� (�) =\n.\n� - �\nShow\n� (�) =\n∑\nRes(� (�)e��)\n(13)\n�+�inf\n� (�) = 1\n� (�)e�� ��\n(14)\n2�� ∫�-�inf\nThe sum is over all poles of e��∕(� - �). As usual, we only consider � > 0.\nHere, � > Re(�) and the integral means the path integral along the vertical line � = �.\nSolution: Proving Equation 13 is straightforward: It is clear that\ne��\n� - �\nhas only one pole which is at � = �. Since,\n(\n)\n∑\ne��\n= e��\nRes\n, �\n� - �\nwe have proved Equation 13.\nProving Equation 14 is more involved. We should first check the convergence of the integral. In this\ncase, � = � + ��, so the integral is\n�+�inf\ninf\ne(�+��)�\ne��\ninf\ne���\n� (�)e�� �� =\n� �� =\n��.\n2�� ∫\n2�� ∫\n� + �� - �\n2� ∫\n� + �� - �\n�-�inf\n-inf\n-inf\n\n||||\n||||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nThe (conditional) convergence of this integral follows using exactly the same argument as in the\ne��\nexample near the end of Topic 9 on the Fourier inversion formula for � (�) =\n. That is, the\nintegrand is a decaying oscillation, around 0, so its integral is also a decaying oscillation around\nsome limiting value.\nNow we use the contour shown below.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nC1\n-C2\n-C3\nC4\nc -Ri\nc + Ri\n-R + Ri\n-R -Ri\nc\nxa\nWe will let � go to infinity and use the following steps to prove Equation 14.\n1. The residue theorem guarantees that if the curve is large enough to contain � then\n(\n)\ne��\n∑\ne��\n= e��\n�� =\nRes\n, �\n.\n2�� ∫�1-�2-�3+�4 � - �\n� - �\n2. In a moment we will show that the integrals over �2, �3, �4 all go to 0 as � → inf.\n3. Clearly as � goes to infinity, the integral over �1 goes to the integral in Equation 14\nPutting these steps together we have\ne��\n�+�inf\ne��\ne�� = lim\n�� = ∫\n��.\n�→inf ∫�1-�2-�3+�4 � - �\n� - �\n�-�inf\nExcept for proving the claims in step 2, this proves Equation 14.\nTo verify step 2 we look at one side at a time.\n�2: �2 is parametrized by � = �(�) = � + ��, with -� ≤ � ≤ �. So,\n�\n�\ne��\ne(�+��)�\ne��\ne�� - e-��\n��\n�� =\n.\n= ∫\n≤∫\n|∫�2 � - �\n|\n-� |� + �� - �|\n-� �\n��\nSince � and � are fixed, it's clear this goes to 0 as � goes to infinity.\nThe bottom �4 is handled in exactly the same manner as the top �2.\n�3: �3 is parametrized by � = �(�) = -� + ��, with -� ≤ � ≤ �. So,\n|\ne��\n|\n�\ne(-�+��)�\n� e-��\ne-��\n�\n2�e-��\n��\n�� =\n�� =\n.\n= ∫\n≤∫\n|∫�3 � - �\n|\n-� |-� + �� - � |\n-� � + �\n� + � ∫-�\n� + �\nSince � and � > 0 are fixed, it's clear this goes to 0 as � goes to infinity.\nExample 12.19. Repeat the previous example with � (�) = � for � > 0, � (�) = 1∕�2.\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nThis is similar to the previous example. Since � decays like 1∕�2 we can actually allow � ≥ 0\nTheorem 12.20. Laplace inversion 1. Assume � is continuous and of exponential type �. Then for\n� > � we have\n�+�inf\n� (�) = 1\n� (�)e�� ��.\n(15)\n2�� ∫�-�inf\nAs usual, this formula holds for � > 0.\nProof. The proof uses the Fourier inversion formula.\nWe will just accept this theorem for now.\nExample 12.18 above illustrates the theorem.\nTheorem 12.21. Laplace inversion 2. Suppose � (�) has a finite number of poles and decays like\n1∕� (or faster). Define\n� (�) =\n∑\nRes(� (�)e��, ��), where the sum is over all the poles ��.\n(16)\nThen (� ; �) = � (�)\nProof. Proof given in class. To be added here. The basic ideas are present in the examples above,\nthough it requires a fairly clever choice of contours.\nThe integral inversion formula in Equation 15 can be viewed as writing � (�) as a 'sum' of exponen\ntials. This is extremely useful. For example, for a linear system if we know how the system responds\nto input � (�) = e�� for all �, then we know how it responds to any input by writing it as a 'sum' of\nexponentials.\n12.9 Delay and feedback.\nLet � (�) = 0 for � < 0. Fix � > 0 and let h(�) = � (� - �). So, h(�) is a delayed version of the signal\n� (�). The Laplace property Equation 10 says\n-��� (�),\n�(�) = e\nwhere � and � are the Laplace transforms of h and � respectively.\nNow, suppose we have a system with system function �(�). (Again, called the open loop system.)\nAs before, can feed the output back through the system. But, instead of just multiplying the output\nby a scalar we can delay it also. This is captured by the feedback factor �e-��.\nThe system function for the closed loop system is\n�\n���(�) = 1 + �e-���\nNote even if you start with a rational function the system function of the closed loop with delay is\nnot rational. Usually it has an infinite number of poles.\nExample 12.22. Suppose �(�) = 1, � = 1 and � = 1 find the poles of ���(�).\nSolution:\n.\n���(�) = 1 + e-�\nSo the poles occur where e-� = -1, i.e. at ���, where � is an odd integer. There are an infinite\nnumber of poles on the imaginary axis.\nExample 12.23. Suppose �(�) = 1, � = 1 and � = 1∕2 find the poles of ���(�). Is the closed loop\nsystem stable?\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nSolution:\n���(�) = 1 + e-�∕2.\nSo the poles occur where e-� = -2, i.e. at - log(2)+���, where � is an odd integer. Since - log(2) <\n0, there are an infinite number of poles in the left half-plane. With all poles in the left half-plane,\nthe system is stable.\nExample 12.24. Suppose �(�) = 1, � = 1 and � = 2 find the poles of ���(�). Is the closed loop\nsystem stable?\nSolution:\n.\n���(�) = 1 + 2e-�\nSo the poles occur where e-� = -1∕2, i.e. at log(2)+���, where � is an odd integer. Since log(2) > 0,\nthere are an infinite number of poles in the right half-plane. With poles in the right half-plane, the\nsystem is not stable.\nRemark. If Re(�) is large enough we can express the system function\n�(�) = 1 + �e-��\nas a geometric series\n-�� + �2 -2�� - �3 -3�� + ...\n= 1 - �e\ne\ne\n1 + �e-��\nSo, for input � (�), we have output\n-��� (�) + �2e-2��� (�) - �3e-3��� (�) + ...\n�(�) = �(�)� (�) = � (�) - �e\nUsing the shift formula Equation 10, we have\n�(�) = � (�) - �� (� - �) + �2� (� -2�) - �3� (� -3�) + ...\n(This is not really an infinite series because � (�) = 0 for � < 0.) If the input is bounded and � < 1\nthen even for large � the series is bounded. So bounded input produces bounded output -this is also\nwhat is meant by stability. On the other hand if � > 1, then bounded input can lead to unbounded\noutput -this is instability.\n12.10 Table of Laplace transforms\nProperties and Rules\nWe assume that � (�) = 0 for � < 0.\nFunction\nTransform\ninf\n� (�)\n� (�) = ∫\n� (�)e-�� ��\n(Definition)\n� � (�) + � �(�)\n� � (�) + � �(�)\n(Linearity)\ne��� (�)\n� (� - �)\n(�-shift)\n� ′(�)\n�� (�) - � (0)\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\n� ′′(�)\n�2� (�) - �� (0) - � ′(0)\n� (�)(�)\n��� (�) - ��-1� (0)-\n⋯ - � (�-1)(0)\n�� (�)\n-� ′(�)\n��� (�)\n(-1)�� (�)(�)\n-��� (�)\n� (� - �)\ne\n(�-translation or �-shift)\n�\n� (�)\n� (�) ��\n(integration rule)\n∫\n�\n� (�)\ninf\n� (�) ��\n�\n∫�\n\n12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM\nFunction Table\nFunction\nTransform\nRegion of convergence\n1∕�\nRe(�) > 0\ne��\n1∕(� - �)\nRe(�) > Re(�)\n�\n1∕�2\nRe(�) > 0\n��\n�!∕��+1\nRe(�) > 0\ncos(��)\n�∕(�2 + �2)\nRe(�) > 0\nsin(��)\n�∕(�2 + �2)\nRe(�) > 0\ne�� cos(��)\n(� - �)∕((� - �)2 + �2)\nRe(�) > Re(�)\ne�� sin(��)\n�∕((� - �)2 + �2)\nRe(�) > Re(�)\n�(�)\nall �\n�(� - �)\n-��\ne\nall �\ne�� + e-��\ncosh(��) =\n�∕(�2 - �2)\nRe(�) > �\ne�� - e-��\nsinh(��) =\n�∕(�2 - �2)\nRe(�) > �\n1 (sin(��) - �� cos(��))\n2�3\n(�2 + �2)2\nRe(�) > 0\n�\n� sin(��)\n�\n(�2 + �2)2\nRe(�) > 0\n1 (sin(��) + �� cos(��))\n2�\n�2\n(�2 + �2)2\nRe(�) > 0\n��e��\n�!∕(� - �)�+1\nRe(�) > Re(�)\n√\n� �\n√\n�\nRe(�) > 0\n��\nΓ(� + 1)\n��+1\nRe(�) > 0\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Topic 13 Notes\nJeremy Orloff\n13 Analytic continuation and the Gamma function\n13.1 Introduction\nIn this topic we will look at the Gamma function. This is an important and fascinating function that\ngeneralizes factorials from integers to all complex numbers. We look at a few of its many interesting\nproperties. In particular, we will look at its connection to the Laplace transform.\nWe will start by discussing the notion of analytic continuation. We will see that we have, in fact,\nbeen using this already without any comment. This was a little sloppy mathematically speaking and\nwe will make it more precise here.\n13.2 Analytic continuation\nIf we have an function which is analytic on a region �, we can sometimes extend the function to be\nanalytic on a bigger region. This is called analytic continuation.\nExample 13.1. Consider the function\ninf\n� (�) = ∫\ne3�e-�� ��.\n(1)\nWe recognize this as the Laplace transform of � (�) = e3� (though we switched the variable from �\nto �). The integral converges absolutely and � is analytic in the region � = {Re(�) > 3}.\nCan we extend � (�) to be analytic on a bigger region �? That is, can we find a region � a function\n�(�) such that\n1. � contains �\n2. �(�) is analytic on �\n3. �(�) agrees with � on �, i.e. �(�) = � (�) for � ∈ �.\nSolution: Yes! We know that � (�) =\n-valid for any � in �. So we can define �(�) =\n� -3\n� -3\nfor any � in � = � - {3}.\nWe say that we have analytically continued � on � to � on �.\nNote. Usually we don't rename the function. We would just say � (�) defined by Equation 1 can be\ncontinued to � (�) =\non �.\n� -3\nDefinition. Suppose � (�) is analytic on a region �. Suppose also that � is contained in a region �.\nWe say that � can be analytically continued from � to � if there is a function �(�) such that\n1. �(�) is analytic on �.\n2. �(�) = � (�) for all � in �.\nAs noted above, we usually just use the same symbol � for the function on � and its continuation to\n�.\n\n13 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nA\nB\n-1\nThe region � = Re(�) > 0 is contained in � = Re(�) > -1.\nNote. We used analytic continuation implicitly in, for example, the Laplace inversion formula in\nvolving residues of � (�) = (� ; �). Recall that we wrote that for � (�) = e3�, � (�) =\nand\n�-3\n� (�) =\n∑\nresidues of � .\nAs an integral, � (�) was defined for Re(�) > 3, but the residue formula relies on its analytic contin\nuation to � - {3}.\n13.2.1 Analytic continuation is unique\nTheorem 13.2. Suppose �, � are analytic on a connected region �. If � = � on an open subset of\n� then � = � on all of �.\nProof. Let h = � - �. By hypothesis h(�) = 0 on an open set in �. Clearly this means that the zeros\nof h are not isolated. Back in Topic 7 we showed that for analytic h on a connected region � either\nthe zeros are isolated or else h is identically zero on �. Thus, h is identically 0, which implies � = �\non �.\nCorollary. There is at most one way to analytically continue a function from a region � to a con\nnected region �.\nProof. Two analytic continuations would agree on � and therefore must be the same.\nExtension. Since the proof of the theorem uses the fact that zeros are isolated, we actually have the\nstronger statement: if � and � agree on a nondiscrete subset of � then they are equal. In particular,\nif � and � are two analytic functions on � and they agree on a line or ray in � then they are equal.\nHere is an example that shows why we need � to be connected in Theorem 13.2.\nExample 13.3. Suppose � is the plane minus the real axis. Define two functions on � as follows.\n{\n1 for � in the upper half-plane\n� (�) =\n0 for � in the lower half-plane\n{\n1 for � in the upper half-plane\n�(�) =\n1 for � in the lower half-plane\nBoth � and � are analytic on � and agree on an open set (the upper half-plane), but they are not the\nsame function.\n\n13 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION\nHere is an example that shows a little care must be taken in applying the corollary.\nExample 13.4. Suppose we define � and � as follows\n� (�) = log(�) with 0 < � < 2�\n�(�) = log(�) with -� < � < �\nClearly � and � agree on the first quadrant. But we can't use the theorem to conclude that � = �\neverywhere. The problem is that the regions where they are defined are different. � is defined on �\nminus the positive real axis, and � is defined on � minus the negative real axis. The region where\nthey are both defined is � minus the real axis, which is not connected.\nBecause they are both defined on the upper half-plane, we can conclude that they are the same there.\n(It's easy to see this is true.) But (in this case) being equal in the first quadrant doesn't imply they\nare the same in the lower half-plane.\n13.3 Definition and properties of the Gamma function\nDefinition. The Gamma function is defined by the integral formula\ninf\nΓ(�) = ∫\n��-1e-� ��\n(2)\nThe integral converges absolutely for Re(�) > 0.\nProperties\n1. Γ(�) is defined and analytic in the region Re(�) > 0.\n2. Γ(� + 1) = �!, for integers � ≥ 0.\n3. Γ(� + 1) = �Γ(�) (functional equation)\nThis property and Property 2 characterize the factorial function. Thus, Γ(�) generalizes �! to\ncomplex numbers �. Some authors will write Γ(� + 1) = �!.\n4. Γ(�) can be analytically continued to be meromorphic on the entire plane with simple poles at\n0, -1, -2 .... The residues are\n(-1)�\nRes(Γ, -�) =\n�!\n[\ninf (\n)\n]-1\n∏\n�e��\n-�∕�\n5. Γ(�) =\n1 + � e\n, where � is Euler's constant\n�\n� = lim 1 + 1 +\n+ ...\n-log(�) ≈0.577\n�→inf\n�\nThis property uses an infinite product. Unfortunately we won't have time, but infinte products\nrepresent an entire topic on their own. Note that the infinite product makes the positions of\nthe poles of Γ clear.\n�\n6. Γ(�)Γ(1 - �) = sin(��)\nWith Property 5 this gives a product formula for sin(��).\n\n13 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION\n√\n7. Γ(� + 1) ≈\n2���+1∕2e-� for |�| large, Re(�) > 0.\n√\nIn particular, �! ≈\n2���+1∕2e-�. (Stirling's formula)\n8. 22�-1Γ(�)Γ(� + 1∕2) =\n√\n�Γ(2�) (Legendre duplication formula)\nNotes. These are just some of the many properties of Γ(�). As is often the case, we could have\nchosen to define Γ(�) in terms of some of its properties and derived Equation 2 as a theorem.\nWe will prove (some of) these properties below.\n√\n√\nExample 13.5. Use the properties of Γ to show that Γ(1∕2) =\n� and Γ(3∕2) =\n�∕2.\nSolution: From Property 2 we have Γ(1) = 0! = 1. The Legendre duplication formula with � = 1∕2\nthen shows\n(1)\n(1)\n√\n20Γ\nΓ(1) =\n√\n�Γ(1) ⇒ Γ\n=\n�.\nNow, using the functional equation Property 3 we get\n√\n(3)\n(1\n)\n(1)\n�\nΓ\n= Γ\n+ 1 =\nΓ\n=\n.\n13.4 Connection to Laplace\nΓ(�)\nClaim. For Re(�) > 1 and Re(�) > 0, (��-1; �) =\n.\n��\ninf\n��-1e-�� ��.\nProof. By definition (��-1; �) =\nIt is clear that if Re(�) > 1, then the integral\n∫0\nconverges absolutely for Re(�) > 0.\nLet's start by assuming that � > 0 is real. Use the change of variable � = ��. The Laplace integral\nbecomes\ninf\ninf ( )�-1\ninf\n��-1e-�� �� = ∫\n�\n-� ��\n��-1e-�\nΓ(�)\ne\n=\n=\n��.\n∫\n�\n�\n�� ∫\n��\nΓ(�)\nThis shows that (��-1; �) =\nfor � real and positive. Since both sides of this equation are\n��\nanalytic on Re(�) > 0, the extension to Theorem 13.2 guarantees they are the same.\nCorollary. Γ(�) = (��-1; 1). (Of course, this is also clear directly from the definition of Γ(�) in\nEquation 2.\n13.5 Proofs of (some) properties of Γ\nProperty 1. This is clear since the integral converges absolutely for Re(�) > 0.\n�!\nProperty 2. We know (see the Laplace table) (��; �) =\n. Setting � = 1 and using the corollary\n��+1\nto the claim above we get\nΓ(� + 1) = (��; 1) = �!.\n(We could also prove this formula directly from the integral definition of of Γ(�).)\n\n13 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION\nProperty 3. We could do this relatively easily using integration by parts, but let's continue using the\nLaplace transform. Let � (�) = ��. We know\nΓ(� + 1)\n(�, �) =\n��+1\n′\nNow assume Re(�) > 0, so � (0) = 0. Then � = ���-1 and we can compute (� ′; �) two ways.\n�Γ(�)\n(� ′; �) = (���-1; �) =\n��\nΓ(� + 1)\n(� ′; �) = �(��; �) =\n��\nComparing these two equations we get property 3 for Re(�) > 0.\nProperty 4. We'll need the following notation for regions in the plane.\n�0 = {Re(�) > 0}\n�1 = {Re(�) > -1} - {0}\n�2 = {Re(�) > -2} - {0, -1}\n�� = {Re(�) > -�} - {0, -1, ... , -� + 1}\nSo far we know that Γ(�) is defined and analytic on �0. Our strategy is to use Property 3 to analyti\ncally continue Γ from �0 to ��. Along the way we will compute the residues at 0 and the negative\nintegers.\nRewrite Property 3 as\nΓ(� + 1)\nΓ(�) =\n(3)\n�\nThe right side of this equation is analytic on �1. Since it agrees with Γ(�) on �0 it represents an\nanalytic continuation from �0 to �1. We easily compute\nRes(Γ, 0) = lim �Γ(�) = Γ(1) = 1.\n�→0\nΓ(� + 2)\nSimilarly, Equation 3 can be expressed as Γ(� + 1) =\n. So,\n� + 1\nΓ(� + 1)\nΓ(� + 2)\nΓ(�) =\n=\n(4)\n�\n(� + 1)�\nThe right side of this equation is analytic on �2. Since it agrees with Γ on �0 it is an analytic\ncontinuation to �2. The residue at -1 is\nΓ(1)\nRes(Γ, -1) = lim (� + 1)Γ(�) =\n= -1.\n�→-1\n-1\nWe can iterate this procedure as far as we want\nΓ(� + � + 1)\nΓ(�) =\n(5)\n(� + �)(� + � - 1) + ... + (� + 1)�\n\n13 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION AND THE GAMMA FUNCTION\nThe right side of this equation is analytic on ��+1. Since it agrees with Γ on �0 it is an analytic\ncontinuation to ��+1. The residue at -� is\nΓ(1)\n(-1)�\nRes(Γ, -�) = lim (� + �)Γ(�) =\n=\n.\n�→-�\n(-1)(-2) ... (-�)\n�!\nWe'll leave the proofs of Properties 5-8 to another class!\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Topic 2 Notes\nJeremy Orloff\n2 Analytic functions\n2.1 Introduction\nThe main goal of this topic is to define and give some of the important properties of complex analytic\nfunctions. A function � (�) is analytic if it has a complex derivative � ′(�). In general, the rules for\ncomputing derivatives will be familiar to you from single variable calculus. However, a much richer\nset of conclusions can be drawn about a complex analytic function than is generally true about real\ndifferentiable functions.\n2.2 The derivative: preliminaries\nIn calculus we defined the derivative as a limit. In complex analysis we will do the same.\nΔ�\n� (� + Δ�) - � (�)\n� ′(�) = lim\n= lim\n.\nΔ�→0 Δ�\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\nBefore giving the derivative our full attention we are going to have to spend some time exploring\nand understanding limits. To motivate this we'll first look at two simple examples - one positive and\none negative.\nExample 2.1. Find the derivative of � (�) = �2.\nSolution: We compute using the definition of the derivative as a limit.\n(� + Δ�)2 - �2\n�2 + 2�Δ� + (Δ�)2 - �2\nlim\n= lim\n= lim 2� + Δ� = 2�.\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\nΔ�→0\nThat was a positive example. Here's a negative one which shows that we need a careful understanding\nof limits.\nExample 2.2. Let � (�) = �. Show that the limit for � ′(0) does not converge.\nSolution: Let's try to compute � ′(0) using a limit:\n� (Δ�) - � (0)\nΔ�\nΔ� - �Δ�\n� ′(0) = lim\n= lim\n=\n.\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\nΔ�→0 Δ�\nΔ� + �Δ�\nHere we used Δ� = Δ� + �Δ�.\nNow, Δ� → 0 means both Δ� and Δ� have to go to 0. There are lots of ways to do this. For example,\nif we let Δ� go to 0 along the �-axis then, Δ� = 0 while Δ� goes to 0. In this case, we would have\n� ′(0) = lim Δ� = 1.\nΔ�→0 Δ�\nOn the other hand, if we let Δ� go to 0 along the positive �-axis then\n-�Δ�\n� ′(0) = lim\n= -1.\nΔ�→0 �Δ�\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nThe limits don't agree! The problem is that the limit depends on how Δ� approaches 0. If we came\nfrom other directions we'd get other values. There's nothing to do, but agree that the limit does not\nexist.\nWell, there is something we can do: explore and understand limits. Let's do that now.\n2.3 Open disks, open deleted disks, open regions\nDefinition. The open disk of radius � around �0 is the set of points � with |� - �0| < �, i.e. all points\nwithin distance � of �0.\nThe open deleted disk of radius � around �0 is the set of points � with 0 < |� - �0| < �. That is, we\nremove the center �0 from the open disk. A deleted disk is also called a punctured disk.\nz0\nr\nz0\nr\nLeft: an open disk around �0; right: a deleted open disk around �0\nDefinition. An open region in the complex plane is a set � with the property that every point in �\ncan be be surrounded by an open disk that lies entirely in �. We will often drop the word open and\nsimply call � a region.\nIn the figure below, the set � on the left is an open region because for every point in � we can draw\na little circle around the point that is completely in �. (The dashed boundary line indicates that the\nboundary of � is not part of �.) In contrast, the set � is not an open region. Notice the point �\nshown is on the boundary, so every disk around � contains points outside �.\nLeft: an open region �; right: � is not an open region\n2.4 Limits and continuous functions\nDefinition. If � (�) is defined on a punctured disk around �0 then we say\nlim � (�) = �0\n�→�0\nif � (�) goes to �0 no matter what direction � approaches �0.\nThe figure below shows several sequences of points that approach �0. If lim � (�) = �0 then � (�)\n�→�0\nmust go to �0 along each of these sequences.\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nSequences going to �0 are mapped to sequences going to �0.\nExample 2.3. Many functions have obvious limits. For example:\nlim �2 = 4\n�→2\nand\nlim(�2 + 2)∕(�3 + 1) = 6∕9.\n�→2\nHere is an example where the limit doesn't exist because different sequences give different limits.\nExample 2.4. (No limit) Show that\n�\n� + ��\nlim\n= lim\n�→0 �\n�→0 � - ��\ndoes not exist.\nSolution: On the real axis we have\n�\n�\n=\n= 1,\n�\n�\nso the limit as � → 0 along the real axis is 1.\nBy contrast, on the imaginary axis we have\n�\n��\n=\n= -1,\n�\n-��\nso the limit as � → 0 along the imaginary axis is -1. Since the two limits do not agree the limit as\n� → 0 does not exist!\n2.4.1 Properties of limits\nWe have the usual properties of limits. Suppose\nlim � (�) = �1 and lim �(�) = �2\n�→�0\n�→�0\nthen\n- lim � (�) + �(�) = �1 + �2.\n�→�0\n- lim � (�)�(�) = �1 ⋅ �2.\n�→�0\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n- If �2 = 0 then lim � (�)∕�(�) = �1∕�2\n�→�0\n- If h(�) is continuous and defined on a neighborhood of �1 then lim h(� (�)) = h(�1)\n�→�0\n(Note: we will give the official definition of continuity in the next section.)\nWe won't give a proof of these properties. As a challenge, you can try to supply it using the formal\ndefinition of limits given in the appendix.\nWe can restate the definition of limit in terms of functions of (�, �). To this end, let's write\n� (�) = � (� + ��) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �)\nand abbreviate\n� = (�, �),\n�0 = (�0, �0),\n�0 = �0 + ��0.\nThen\n{\nlim� →�0 �(�, �) = �0\nlim � (�) = �0\niff\n�→�0\nlim� →�0 �(�, �) = �0.\nNote. The term 'iff' stands for 'if and only if' which is another way of saying 'is equivalent to'.\n2.4.2 Continuous functions\nA function is continuous if it doesn't have any sudden jumps. This is the gist of the following\ndefinition.\nDefinition. If the function � (�) is defined on an open disk around �0 and lim � (�) = � (�0) then we\n�→�0\nsay � is continuous at �0. If � is defined on an open region � then the phrase '� is continuous on\n�' means that � is continuous at every point in �.\nAs usual, we can rephrase this in terms of functions of (�, �):\nFact. � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �) is continuous iff �(�, �) and �(�, �) are continuous as functions of\ntwo variables.\nExample 2.5. (Some continuous functions)\n(i) A polynomial\n� (�) = �0 + �1� + �2�2 + ... + ����\nis continuous on the entire plane. Reason: it is clear that each power (� + ��)� is continuous as a\nfunction of (�, �).\n(ii) The exponential function is continuous on the entire plane. Reason:\ne� = e�+�� = e� cos(�) + �e� sin(�).\nSo the both the real and imaginary parts are clearly continuous as a function of (�, �).\n(iii) The principal branch Arg(�) is continuous on the plane minus the non-positive real axis. Reason:\nthis is clear and is the reason we defined branch cuts for arg. We have to remove the negative real\naxis because Arg(�) jumps by 2� when you cross it. We also have to remove � = 0 because Arg(�)\nis not even defined at 0.\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n(iv) The principal branch of the function log(�) is continuous on the plane minus the non-positive\nreal axis. Reason: the principal branch of log has\nlog(�) = log(�) + � Arg(�).\nSo the continuity of log(�) follows from the continuity of Arg(�).\n2.4.3 Properties of continuous functions\nSince continuity is defined in terms of limits, we have the following properties of continuous func\ntions.\nSuppose � (�) and �(�) are continuous on a region �. Then\n- � (�) + �(�) is continuous on �.\n- � (�)�(�) is continuous on �.\n- � (�)∕�(�) is continuous on � except (possibly) at points where �(�) = 0.\n- If h is continuous on � (�) then h(� (�)) is continuous on �.\nUsing these properties we can claim continuity for each of the following functions:\n- e�2\n- cos(�) = (e�� + e-��)∕2\n- If � (�) and �(�) are polynomials then � (�)∕�(�) is continuous except at roots of �(�).\n2.5 The point at infinity\nBy definition the extended complex plane = � ∪ {inf}. That is, we have one point at infinity to be\nthought of in a limiting sense described as follows.\nA sequence of points {��} goes to infinity if |��| goes to infinity. This \"point at infinity\" is approached\nin any direction we go. All of the sequences shown in the figure below are growing, so they all go\nto the (same) \"point at infinity\".\nVarious sequences all going to infinity.\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nIf we draw a large circle around 0 in the plane, then we call the region outside this circle a neigh\nborhood of infinity.\nR\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nThe shaded region outside the circle of radius � is a neighborhood of infinity.\n2.5.1 Limits involving infinity\nThe key idea is 1∕inf = 0. By this we mean\nlim\n= 0\n�→inf �\nWe then have the following facts:\n- lim � (�) = inf ⇔ lim 1∕� (�) = 0\n�→�0\n�→�0\n- lim � (�) = �0 ⇔ lim � (1∕�) = �0\n�→inf\n�→0\n- lim � (�) = inf ⇔ lim\n= 0\n�→inf\n�→0 � (1∕�)\nExample 2.6. lim e� is not defined because it has different values if we go to infinity in different\n�→inf\n= e�e�� and\ndirections, e.g. we have e�\ne�e��\nlim\n= 0\n�→-inf\ne�e��\nlim\n= inf\n�→+inf\nlim e�e�� is not defined, since � is constant, so e�e�� loops in a circle indefinitely.\n�→+inf\nExample 2.7. Show lim �� = inf (for � a positive integer).\n�→inf\nSolution: We need to show that |��| gets large as |�| gets large. Write � = ����, then\n|��| = |������| = �� = |�|�\n2.5.2 Stereographic projection from the Riemann sphere\nThis is a lovely section and we suggest you read it. However it will be a while before we use it in\n18.04.\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nOne way to visualize the point at inf is by using a (unit) Riemann sphere and the associated stereo\ngraphic projection. The figure below shows a sphere whose equator is the unit circle in the complex\nplane.\nStereographic projection from the sphere to the plane.\nStereographic projection from the sphere to the plane is accomplished by drawing the secant line\nfrom the north pole � through a point on the sphere and seeing where it intersects the plane. This\ngives a 1-1 correspondence between a point on the sphere � and a point in the complex plane �. It\nis easy to see show that the formula for stereographic projection is\n�\n�\n� = (�, �, �) → � =\n+ �\n.\n1 - �\n1 - �\nThe point � = (0, 0, 1) is special, the secant lines from � through � become tangent lines to the\nsphere at � which never intersect the plane. We consider � the point at infinity.\nIn the figure above, the region outside the large circle through the point � is a neighborhood of\ninfinity. It corresponds to the small circular cap around � on the sphere. That is, the small cap\naround � is a neighborhood of the point at infinity on the sphere!\nThe figure below shows another common version of stereographic projection. In this figure the\nsphere sits with its south pole at the origin. We still project using secant lines from the north pole.\n2.6 Derivatives\nThe definition of the complex derivative of a complex function is similar to that of a real derivative\nof a real function: For a function � (�) the derivative � at �0 is defined as\n� (�) - � (�0)\n� ′(�0) = lim\n�→�0\n� - �0\nProvided, of course, that the limit exists. If the limit exists we say � is analytic at �0 or � is differ\nentiable at �0.\n\n|\n|\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nRemember: The limit has to exist and be the same no matter how you approach �0!\nIf � is analytic at all the points in an open region � then we say � is analytic on �.\nAs usual with derivatives there are several alternative notations. For example, if � = � (�) we can\nwrite\n��\n� (�) - � (�0)\nΔ�\n|\n� ′(�0) =\n= lim\n= lim\n��\n�→�0\n� - �0\nΔ�→0 Δ�\n|�0\nExample 2.8. Find the derivative of � (�) = �2.\nSolution: We did this above in Example 2.1. Take a look at that now. Of course, � ′(�) = 2�.\nExample 2.9. Show � (�) = � is not differentiable at any point �.\nSolution: We did this above in Example 2.2. Take a look at that now.\nChallenge. Use polar coordinates to show the limit in the previous example can be any value with\nmodulus 1 depending on the angle at which � approaches �0.\n2.6.1 Derivative rules\nIt wouldn't be much fun to compute every derivative using limits. Fortunately, we have the same\ndifferentiation formulas as for real-valued functions. That is, assuming � and � are differentiable we\nhave:\n�\n- Sum rule:\n(� (�) + �(�)) = � ′ + � ′\n��\n�\n- Product rule:\n(� (�)�(�)) = � ′ � + �� ′\n��\n�\n� ′ � - �� ′\n- Quotient rule:\n(� (�)∕�(�)) =\n��\n�2\n�\n- Chain rule:\n�(� (�)) = � ′(� (�))� ′(�)\n��\n- Inverse rule: �� -1(�) =\n��\n� ′(� -1(�))\nTo give you the flavor of these arguments we'll prove the product rule.\n�\n� (�)�(�) - � (�0)�(�0)\n(� (�)�(�)) = lim\n��\n�→�0\n� - �0\n(� (�) - � (�0))�(�) + � (�0)(�(�) - �(�0))\n= lim\n�→�0\n� - �0\n� (�) - � (�0)\n(�(�) - �(�0))\n= lim\n�(�) + � (�0)\n�→�0\n� - �0\n� - �0\n= � ′(�0)�(�0) + � (�0)� ′(�0)\nHere is an important fact that you would have guessed. We will prove it in the next section.\nTheorem. If � (�) is defined and differentiable on an open disk and � ′(�) = 0 on the disk then � (�)\nis constant.\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n2.7 Cauchy-Riemann equations\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations are our first consequence of the fact that the limit defining � (�) must\nbe the same no matter which direction you approach � from. The Cauchy-Riemann equations will\nbe one of the most important tools in our toolbox.\n2.7.1 Partial derivatives as limits\nBefore getting to the Cauchy-Riemann equations we remind you about partial derivatives. If �(�, �)\nis a function of two variables then the partial derivatives of � are defined as\n��\n�(� + Δ�, �) - �(�, �)\n(�, �) = lim\n,\n��\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\ni.e. the derivative of � holding � constant.\n��\n�(�, � + Δ�) - �(�, �)\n(�, �) = lim\n,\n��\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\ni.e. the derivative of � holding � constant.\n2.7.2 The Cauchy-Riemann equations\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations use the partial derivatives of � and � to allow us to do two things:\nfirst, to check if � has a complex derivative and second, to compute that derivative. We start by\nstating the equations as a theorem.\nTheorem 2.10. (Cauchy-Riemann equations) If � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �) is analytic (complex dif\nferentiable) then\n��\n��\n��\n��\n� ′(�) =\n+ �\n=\n- �\n��\n��\n��\n��\nIn particular,\n��\n�� and �� = - ��\n=\n.\n��\n��\n��\n��\nThis last set of partial differential equations is what is usually meant by the Cauchy-Riemann equa\ntions.\nHere is the short form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n�� = ��\n�� = -��\nProof. Let's suppose that � (�) is differentiable in some region � and\n� (�) = � (� + ��) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �).\nWe'll compute � ′(�) by approaching � first from the horizontal direction and then from the vertical\ndirection. We'll use the formula\n� (� + Δ�) - � (�)\n� ′(�) = lim\n,\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nwhere Δ� = Δ� + �Δ�.\nHorizontal direction: Δ� = 0, Δ� = Δ�\n� (� + Δ�) - � (�)\n� ′(�) = lim\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\n� (� + Δ� + ��) - � (� + ��)\n= lim\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\n(�(� + Δ�, �) + ��(� + Δ�, �)) - (�(�, �) + ��(�, �))\n= lim\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\n�(� + Δ�, �) - �(�, �)\n�(� + Δ�, �) - �(�, �)\n= lim\n+ �\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\nΔ�\n��\n��\n=\n(�, �) + �\n(�, �)\n��\n��\nVertical direction: Δ� = 0, Δ� = �Δ� (We'll do this one a little faster.)\n� (� + Δ�) - � (�)\n� ′(�) = lim\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\n(�(�, � + Δ�) + ��(�, � + Δ�)) - (�(�, �) + ��(�, �))\n= lim\nΔ�→0\n�Δ�\n�(�, � + Δ�) - �(�, �)\n�(�, � + Δ�) - �(�, �)\n= lim\n+ �\nΔ�→0\n�Δ�\n�Δ�\n1 ��\n=\n(�, �) + ��(�, �)\n� ��\n��\n��\n��\n=\n(�, �) - �\n(�, �)\n��\n��\nWe have found two different representations of � ′(�) in terms of the partials of � and �. If put them\ntogether we have the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n��\n��\n��\n��\n��\n��\n- ��\n��\n� ′(�) =\n+ �\n=\n- �\n⇒\n=\n,\nand\n=\n.\n��\n��\n��\n��\n��\n��\n��\n��\nIt turns out that the converse is true and will be very useful to us.\nTheorem. Consider the function � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �) defined on a region �. If � and � satisfy\nthe Cauchy-Riemann equations and have continuous partials then � (�) is differentiable on �.\nThe proof of this is a tricky exercise in analysis. It is somewhat beyond the scope of this class, so\nwe will skip it. If you're interested, with a little effort you should be able to grasp it.\n2.7.3 Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations provide us with a direct way of checking that a function is differen\ntiable and computing its derivative.\nExample 2.11. Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to show that e� is differentiable and its derivative\nis e�.\n= e�+��\nSolution: We write e�\n= e� cos(�) + �e� sin(�). So\n�(�, �) = e� cos(�) and �(�, �) = e� sin(�).\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nComputing partial derivatives we have\n�� = e� cos(�),\n�� = -e� sin(�)\n�� = e� sin(�),\n�� = e� cos(�)\nWe see that �� = �� and �� = -��, so the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied. Thus, e� is\ndifferentiable and\n� e� = �� + ��� = e� cos(�) + �e� sin(�) = e�.\n��\nExample 2.12. Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to show that � (�) = � is not differentiable.\nSolution: � (� + ��) = � - ��, so �(�, �) = �, �(�, �) = -�. Taking partial derivatives\n�� = 1,\n�� = 0,\n�� = 0,\n�� = -1\nSince �� = �� the Cauchy-Riemann equations are not satisfied and therefore � is not differentiable.\nTheorem. If � (�) is differentiable on a disk and � ′(�) = 0 on the disk then � (�) is constant.\nProof. Since � is differentiable and � ′(�) ≡ 0, the Cauchy-Riemann equations show that\n��(�, �) = ��(�, �) = ��(�, �) = ��(�, �) = 0\nWe know from multivariable calculus that a function of (�, �) with both partials identically zero is\nconstant. Thus � and � are constant, and therefore so is � .\n2.7.4 � ′(�) as a 2 × 2 matrix\nRecall that we could represent a complex number � + �� as a 2 × 2 matrix\n[\n]\n� -�\n� + ��\n↔\n.\n(1)\n�\n�\nNow if we write � (�) in terms of (�, �) we have\n� (�) = � (� + ��) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �)\n↔\n� (�, �) = (�(�, �), �(�, �)).\nWe have\n� ′(�) = �� + ���,\nso we can represent � ′(�) as\n[\n]\n�� -�� .\n��\n��\nUsing the Cauchy-Riemann equations we can replace -�� by �� and �� by �� which gives us the\nrepresentation\n[\n]\n��\n��\n� ′(�)\n↔\n,\n�� ��\ni.e, � ′(�) is just the Jacobian of � (�, �).\nFor me, it is easier to remember the Jacobian than the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Since � ′(�) is a\ncomplex number I can use the matrix representation in Equation 1 to remember the Cauchy-Riemann\nequations!\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n2.8 Cauchy-Riemann all the way down\nWe've defined an analytic function as one having a complex derivative. The following theorem\n′\nshows that if � is analytic then so is � . Thus, there are derivatives all the way down!\nTheorem 2.13. Assume the second order partials of � and � exist and are continuous. If � (�) = �+��\nis analytic, then so is � ′(�).\nProof. To show this we have to prove that � ′(�) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. If � = �+��\nwe know\n′\n�� = ��,\n�� = -��,\n� = �� + ���.\nLet's write\n′\n� = � + �� ,\nso, by Cauchy-Riemann,\n� = �� = ��,\n� = �� = -��.\n(2)\nWe want to show that �� = �� and �� = -��. We do them one at a time.\nTo prove �� = ��, we use Equation 2 to see that\n�� = ���\nand �� = ���.\nSince ��� = ���, we have �� = ��.\nSimilarly, to show �� = -��, we compute\n�� = ���\nand �� = -���.\nSo, �� = -��. QED.\nTechnical point. We've assumed as many partials as we need. So far we can't guarantee that all the\npartials exist. Soon we will have a theorem which says that an analytic function has derivatives of\nall order. We'll just assume that for now. In any case, in most examples this will be obvious.\n2.9 Gallery of functions\nIn this section we'll look at many of the functions you know and love as functions of �. For each\none we'll have to do three things.\n1. Define how to compute it.\n2. Specify a branch (if necessary) giving its range.\n3. Specify a domain (with branch cut if necessary) where it is analytic.\n4. Compute its derivative.\nMost often, we can compute the derivatives of a function using the algebraic rules like the quotient\nrule. If necessary we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations or, as a last resort, even the definition\nof the derivative as a limit.\nBefore we start on the gallery we define the term \"entire function\".\nDefinition. A function that is analytic at every point in the complex plane is called an entire function.\nWe will see that e�, ��, sin(�) are all entire functions.\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n2.9.1 Gallery of functions, derivatives and properties\nThe following is a concise list of a number of functions and their complex derivatives. None of\nthe derivatives will surprise you. We also give important properties for some of the functions. The\nproofs for each follow below.\n1. � (�) = e� = e� cos(�) + �e� sin(�).\nDomain = all of � (� is entire).\n� ′(�) = e�.\n2. � (�) ≡ � (constant)\nDomain = all of � (� is entire).\n� ′(�) = 0.\n3. � (�) = �� (� an integer ≥ 0)\nDomain = all of � (� is entire).\n� ′(�) = ���-1 .\n4. � (�) (polynomial)\nA polynomial has the form � (�) = ���� + ��-1��-1 + ... + �0.\nDomain = all of � (� (�) is entire).\n� ′(�) = �����-1 + (� - 1)��-1��-1 + ... + 2�2� + �1.\n5. � (�) = 1∕�\nDomain = � - {0} (the punctured plane).\n� ′(�) = -1∕�2 .\n6. � (�) = � (�)∕�(�) (rational function).\nWhen � and � are polynomials � (�)∕�(�) is called a rational function.\nIf we assume that � and � have no common roots, then:\nDomain = � -{roots of �}\n� ′ � - � � ′\n� ′(�) =\n.\n�2\n7. sin(�), cos(�)\ne�� + e-��\ne�� - e-��\nDefinition. cos(�) =\n,\nsin(�) =\n2�\n(By Euler's formula we know this is consistent with cos(�) and sin(�) when � = � is real.)\nDomain: these functions are entire.\n� cos(�) = - sin(�),\n��\n� sin(�) = cos(�).\n��\nOther key properties of sin and cos:\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n- cos2(�) + sin2(�) = 1\ne�\n-\n= cos(�) + � sin(�)\n- Periodic in � with period 2�, e.g. sin(� + 2� + ��) = sin(� + ��).\n- They are not bounded!\n- In the form � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �) we have\ncos(�) = cos(�) cosh(�) - � sin(�) sinh(�)\nsin(�) = sin(�) cosh(�) + � cos(�) sinh(�)\n(cosh and sinh are defined below.)\n- The zeros of sin(�) are � = �� for � any integer.\nThe zeros of cos(�) are � = �∕2 + �� for � any integer.\n(That is, they have only real zeros that you learned about in your trig. class.)\n8. Other trig functions cot(�), sec(�) etc.\nDefinition. The same as for the real versions of these function, e.g. cot(�) = cos(�)∕ sin(�),\nsec(�) = 1∕ cos(�).\nDomain: The entire plane minus the zeros of the denominator.\nDerivative: Compute using the quotient rule, e.g.\n(\n)\n� tan(�)\n�\nsin(�)\ncos(�) cos(�) - sin(�)(- sin(�))\n2 �\n��\n= ��\n=\ncos(�)\n=\ncos2(�)\n= sec\ncos2(�)\n(No surprises there!)\n9. sinh(�), cosh(�) (hyperbolic sine and cosine)\nDefinition.\ne� + e-�\ncosh(�) =\n,\ne� - e-�\nsinh(�) =\nDomain: these functions are entire.\n� cosh(�) = sinh(�),\n��\n� sinh(�) = cosh(�)\n��\nOther key properties of cosh and sinh:\n- cosh2(�) - sinh2(�) = 1\n- For real �, cosh(�) is real and positive, sinh(�) is real.\n- cosh(��) = cos(�), sinh(�) = -� sin(��).\n10. log(�) (See Topic 1.)\nDefinition. log(�) = log(|�|) + � arg(�).\nBranch: Any branch of arg(�).\nDomain: � minus a branch cut where the chosen branch of arg(�) is discontinuous.\n�\nlog(�) =\n��\n�\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n11. �� (any complex �) (See Topic 1.)\n= e� log(�)\nDefinition. ��\n.\nBranch: Any branch of log(�).\nDomain: Generally the domain is � minus a branch cut of log. If � is an integer ≥ 0 then ��\nis entire. If � is a negative integer then �� is defined and analytic on � - {0}.\n���\n= ���-1 .\n��\n12. sin-1(�)\n√\nDefinition. sin-1(�) = -� log(�� +\n1 - �2).\nThe definition is chosen so that sin(sin-1(�)) = �. The derivation of the formula is as follows.\nLet � = sin-1(�), so � = sin(�). Then,\ne�� - e-��\n2�� -2��e�� -1 = 0\n� =\n⇒ e\n2�\nSolving the quadratic in e�� gives\n√\n√\n2�� +\n-4�2 + 4\ne�� =\n= �� +\n1 - �2.\nTaking the log gives\n√\n√\n�� = log(�� +\n1 - �2) ⇔ � = -� log(�� +\n1 - �2).\nFrom the definition we can compute the derivative:\n� sin-1(�) = √ 1\n.\n��\n1 - �2\nChoosing a branch is tricky because both the square root and the log require choices. We will\nlook at this more carefully in the future.\nFor now, the following discussion and figure are for your amusement.\nSine (likewise cosine) is not a 1-1 function, so if we want sin-1(�) to be single-valued then we\nhave to choose a region where sin(�) is 1-1. (This will be a branch of sin-1(�), i.e. a range for\nthe image,) The figure below shows a domain where sin(�) is 1-1. The domain consists of the\nvertical strip � = � + �� with -�∕2 < � < �∕2 together with the two rays on boundary where\n� ≥ 0 (shown as red lines). The figure indicates how the regions making up the domain in the\n�-plane are mapped to the quadrants in the �-plane.\nA domain where � → � = sin(�) is one-to-one\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n2.9.2 A few proofs\nHere we prove at least some of the facts stated in the list just above.\n1. � (�) = e�. This was done in Example 2.11 using the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n2. � (�) ≡ � (constant). This case is trivial.\n3. � (�) = �� (� an integer ≥ 0): show � ′(�) = ���-1\nIt's probably easiest to use the definition of derivative directly. Before doing that we note the\nfactorization\n�� - �� = (� - �0)(��-1 + ��-2�0 + ��-3�2\n0 + ... + �2��-3 + ���-2 + ��-1)\nNow\n�� - ��\n� (�) - � (�0)\n� ′(�0) = lim\n= lim\n�→�0\n� - �0\n�→�0 � - �0\n= lim (��-1 + ��-2�0 + ��-3�2\n0 + ... + �2��-3 + ���-2 + ��-1)\n�→�0\n= ���\n-1 .\nSince we showed directly that the derivative exists for all �, the function must be entire.\n4. � (�) (polynomial). Since a polynomial is a sum of monomials, the formula for the derivative\nfollows from the derivative rule for sums and the case � (�) = ��. Likewise the fact the � (�)\nis entire.\n5. � (�) = 1∕�. This follows from the quotient rule.\n6. � (�) = � (�)∕�(�). This also follows from the quotient rule.\n7. sin(�), cos(�). All the facts about sin(�) and cos(�) follow from their definition in terms of\nexponentials.\n8. Other trig functions cot(�), sec(�) etc. Since these are all defined in terms of cos and sin, all\nthe facts about these functions follow from the derivative rules.\n9. sinh(�), cosh(�). All the facts about sinh(�) and cosh(�) follow from their definition in terms\nof exponentials.\n10. log(�). The derivative of log(�) can be found by differentiating the relation elog(�) = � using\nthe chain rule. Let � = log(�), so e� = � and\n� e�\n��\n�e� ��\ne���\n��\n=\n= 1\n⇒\n= 1\n⇒\n= 1\n⇒\n= e�\n��\n��\n�� ��\n��\n��\nUsing � = log(�) we get\n� log(�)\n= .\n��\n�\n11. �� (any complex �). The derivative for this follows from the formula\n= e� log(�)\n���\n= e� log(�) ⋅ �\n���\n��\n⇒\n=\n= ���-1\n��\n�\n�\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n2.10 Branch cuts and function composition\nWe often compose functions, i.e. � (�(�)). In general in this case we have the chain rule to compute\nthe derivative. However we need to specify the domain for � where the function is analytic. And\nwhen branches and branch cuts are involved we need to take care.\nExample 2.14. Let � (�) = e�2 . Since e� and �2 are both entire functions, so is � (�) = e�2 . The\nchain rule gives us\n� ′(�) = e�2(2�).\nExample 2.15. Let � (�) = e� and �(�) = 1∕�. � (�) is entire and �(�) is analytic everywhere but 0.\nSo � (�(�)) is analytic except at 0 and\n�� (�(�))\n1∕� ⋅ -1\n= � ′(�(�))� ′(�) = e\n��\n�2 .\nExample 2.16. Let h(�) = 1∕(e� - 1). Clearly h is entire except where the denominator is 0. The\ndenominator is 0 when e� -1 = 0. That is, when � = 2��� for any integer �. Thus, h(�) is analytic\non the set\n� - {2���, where � is any integer}\nThe quotient rule gives h ′(�) = -e�∕(e� - 1)2. A little more formally: h(�) = � (�(�)). where\n� (�) = 1∕� and � = �(�) = e� -1. We know that �(�) is entire and � (�) is analytic everywhere\nexcept � = 0. Therefore, � (�(�)) is analytic everywhere except where �(�) = 0.\nExample 2.17. It can happen that the derivative has a larger domain where it is analytic than the\noriginal function. The main example is � (�) = log(�). This is analytic on � minus a branch cut.\nHowever\n�\nlog(�) =\n��\n�\nis analytic on � - {0}. The converse can't happen.\n√\nExample 2.18. Define a region where\n1 - � is analytic.\nSolution: Choosing the principal branch of argument, we have\n√\n� is analytic on\n� -{� ≤ 0, � = 0}, (see figure below.).\nSo\n√\n1 - � is analytic except where � = 1 - � is on the branch cut, i.e. where � = 1 - � is real and\n≤ 0. It's easy to see that\n� = 1 - � is real and ≤ 0 ⇔ � is real and ≥ 1.\n√\nSo\n1 - � is analytic on the region (see figure below)\n� -{� ≥ 1, � = 0}\nNote. A different branch choice for\n√\n� would lead to a different region where\n√\n1 - � is analytic.\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nThe figure below shows the domains with branch cuts for this example.\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\n√\n√\ndomain for\n�\ndomain for\n1 - �\n√\nExample 2.19. Define a region where � (�) =\n1 + e� is analytic.\nSolution: Again, let's take\n√\n� to be analytic on the region\n� -{� ≤ 0, � = 0}\nSo, � (�) is analytic except where 1 + e� is real and ≤ 0. That is, except where e� is real and ≤ -1.\nNow, e� = e�e�� is real only when � is a multiple of �. It is negative only when � is an odd mutltiple\nof �. It has magnitude greater than 1 only when � > 0. Therefore � (�) is analytic on the region\n� -{� ≥ 0, � = odd multiple of �}\nThe figure below shows the domains with branch cuts for this example.\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\n-3πi\n-πi\nπi\n3πi\n√\n√\ndomain for\n�\ndomain for\ne� + 1\n2.11 Appendix: Limits\nThe intuitive idea behind limits is relatively simple. Still, in the 19th century mathematicians were\ntroubled by the lack of rigor, so they set about putting limits and analysis on a firm footing with\ncareful definitions and proofs. In this appendix we give you the formal definition and connect it\nto the intuitive idea. In 18.04 we will not need this level of formality. Still, it's nice to know the\nfoundations are solid, and some students may find this interesting.\n\n||||\n||||\n|||\n|||\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\n2.11.1 Limits of sequences\nIntuitively, we say a sequence of complex numbers �1, �2, ... converges to � if for large �, �� is really\nclose to �. To be a little more precise, if we put a small circle of radius � around � then eventually the\nsequence should stay inside the circle. Let's refer to this as the sequence being captured by the circle.\nThis has to be true for any circle no matter how small, though it may take longer for the sequence to\nbe 'captured' by a smaller circle.\nThis is illustrated in the figure below. The sequence is strung along the curve shown heading towards\n�. The bigger circle of radius �2 captures the sequence by the time � = 47, the smaller circle doesn't\ncapture it till � = 59. Note that �25 is inside the larger circle, but since later points are outside the\ncircle we don't say the sequence is captured at � = 25\nA sequence of points converging to �\nDefinition. The sequence �1, �2, �3, ... converges to the value � if for every � > 0 there is a number\n�� such that |�� - �| < � for all � > �� . We write this as\nlim �� = �.\n�→inf\nAgain, the definition just says that eventually the sequence is within � of �, no matter how small you\nchoose �.\nExample 2.20. Show that the sequence �� = (1∕� + �)2 has limit -1.\nSolution: This is clear because 1∕� → 0. For practice, let's phrase it in terms of epsilons: given\n� > 0 we have to choose �� such that\n|�� - (-1)| < � for all � > ��\nOne strategy is to look at |�� + 1| and see what �� should be. We have\n2�\n|�� - (-1)| =\n|\n(\n�\n1 + �\n)2\n+ 1\n|\n=\n|�2 + � |\n< �2 + �\nSo all we have to do is pick �� large enough that\n+\n< �\n�2\n��\n�\nSince this can clearly be done we have proved that �� → �.\n\n2 ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS\nThis was clearly more work than we want to do for every limit. Fortunately, most of the time we can\napply general rules to determine a limit without resorting to epsilons!\nRemarks.\n1. In 18.04 we will be able to spot the limit of most concrete examples of sequences. The formal\ndefinition is needed when dealing abstractly with sequences.\n2. To mathematicians � is one of the go-to symbols for a small number. The prominent and rather\neccentric mathematician Paul Erdos used to refer to children as epsilons, as in 'How are the\nepsilons doing?'\n3. The term 'captured by the circle' is not in common usage, but it does capture what is happen\ning.\n2.11.2\nlim � (�)\n�→�0\nSometimes we need limits of the form lim � (�) = �. Again, the intuitive meaning is clear: as � gets\n�→�0\nclose to �0 we should see � (�) get close to �. Here is the technical definition\nDefinition. Suppose � (�) is defined on a punctured disk 0 < |� - �0| < � around �0. We say\nlim � (�) = � if for every � > 0 there is a � such that\n�→�0\n|� (�) - �| < � whenever 0 < |� - �0| < �\nThis says exactly that as � gets closer (within �) to �0 we have � (�) is close (within �) to �. Since �\ncan be made as small as we want, � (�) must go to �.\nRemarks.\n1. Using the punctured disk (also called a deleted neighborhood) means that � (�) does not have\nto be defined at �0 and, if it is then � (�0) does not necessarily equal �. If � (�0) = � then we\nsay the � is continuous at �0.\n2. Ask any mathematician to complete the phrase \"For every �\" and the odds are that they will\nrespond \"there is a � ...\"\n2.11.3 Connection between limits of sequences and limits of functions\nHere's an equivalent way to define limits of functions: the limit lim � (�) = � if, for every sequence\n�→�0\nof points {��} with limit �0 the sequence {� (��)} has limit �.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Topic 3 Notes\nJeremy Orloff\n3 Line integrals and Cauchy's theorem\n3.1 Introduction\nThe basic theme here is that complex line integrals will mirror much of what we've seen for multi-\nvariable calculus line integrals. But, just like working with ��� is easier than working with sine and\ncosine, complex line integrals are easier to work with than their multivariable analogs. At the same\ntime they will give deep insight into the workings of these integrals.\nTo define complex line integrals, we will need the following ingredients:\n- The complex plane: � = � + ��\n- The complex differential �� = �� + ���\n- A curve in the complex plane: �(�) = �(�) + ��(�), defined for � ≤ � ≤ �.\n- A complex function: � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �)\n3.2 Complex line integrals\nLine integrals are also called path or contour integrals. Given the ingredients we define the complex\nline integral ∫�\n� (�) �� by\n�\n� (�) �� ∶= ∫\n� (�(�))� ′(�) ��.\n(1a)\n∫�\n�\nYou should note that this notation looks just like integrals of a real variable. We don't need the\nvectors and dot products of line integrals in �2. Also, make sure you understand that the product\n� (�(�))� ′(�) is just a product of complex numbers.\nAn alternative notation uses �� = �� + ��� to write\n� (�) �� = ∫�\n(� + ��)(�� + ���)\n(1b)\n∫�\nLet's check that Equations 1a and 1b are the same. Equation 1b is really a multivariable calculus\nexpression, so thinking of �(�) as (�(�), �(�)) it becomes\n�\n(\n)\n� (�) �� = ∫\n[�(�(�), �(�)) + ��(�(�), �(�)] � ′(�) + �� ′(�) ��\n∫�\n�\nBut,\n�(�(�), �(�)) + ��(�(�), �(�)) = � (�(�))\nand\n� ′(�) + �� ′(�) = � ′(�)\n\n|||\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\nso the right hand side of this equation is\n�\n� (�(�))� ′(�) ��.\n∫�\nThat is, it is exactly the same as the expression in Equation 1a.\nExample 3.1. Compute ∫�\n�2�� along the straight line from 0 to 1 + �.\nSolution: We parametrize the curve as �(�) = �(1 + �) with 0 ≤ � ≤ 1. So � ′(�) = 1 + �. The line\nintegral is\n2�(1 + �)\n�2�� = ∫\n�2(1 + �)2(1 + �) �� =\n.\n∫\nExample 3.2. Compute ∫�\n��� along the straight line from 0 to 1 + �.\nSolution: We can use the same parametrization as in the previous example. So,\n� �� = ∫\n�(1 - �)(1 + �) �� = 1.\n∫�\nExample 3.3. Compute ∫�\n�2 �� along the unit circle.\n�e��\nSolution: We parametrize the unit circle by �(�) = e��, where 0 ≤ � ≤ 2�. We have � ′(�) =\n.\nSo, the integral becomes\n2�\n2�\n2�\ne�3�\n�2 �� = ∫\ne2���e�� �� = ∫\n�e3�� �� =\n= 0.\n∫�\n3 |0\nExample 3.4. Compute ∫ � �� along the unit circle.\nSolution: Parametrize �: �(�) = e��, with 0 ≤ � ≤ 2�. So, � ′(�) = �e��. Putting this into the integral\ngives\n2�\n2�\n� �� = ∫\ne�� � e�� �� = ∫\n� �� = 2��.\n∫�\n3.3 Fundamental theorem for complex line integrals\nThis is exactly analogous to the fundamental theorem of calculus.\nTheorem 3.5. (Fundamental theorem of complex line integrals) If � (�) is a complex analytic func\ntion on an open region � and � is a curve in � from �0 to �1 then\n� ′(�) �� = � (�1) - � (�0).\n∫�\n\n|||\n|||\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\nProof. This is an application of the chain rule. We have\n�� (�(�)) = � ′(�(�)) � ′(�).\n��\nSo\n�\n�\n�\n�� (�(�))\n� ′(�) �� = ∫\n� ′(�(�)) � ′(�) �� = ∫\n�� = � (�(�)) = � (�1) - � (�0).\n��\n∫�\n�\n�\n|�\n′\nAnother equivalent way to state the fundamental theorem is: if � has an antiderivative � , i.e. � = �\nthen\n� (�) �� = � (�1) - � (�0).\n∫�\nExample 3.6. Redo ∫�\n�2 ��, with � the straight line from 0 to 1 + �.\nSolution: We can check by inspection that �2 has an antiderivative � (�) = �3∕3. Therefore the\nfundamental theorem implies\n1+�\n�3\n(1 + �)3\n2�(1 + �)\n�2 �� =\n=\n=\n.\n∫�\n3 |0\nExample 3.7. Redo ∫�\n�2 ��, with � the unit circle.\nSolution: Again, since �2 had antiderivative �3∕3 we can evaluate the integral by plugging the end\npoints of � into the �3∕3. Since the endpoints are the same the resulting difference will be 0!\n3.4 Path independence\nWe say the integral ∫�\n� (�) �� is path independent if it has the same value for any two paths with the\nsame endpoints. More precisely, if � (�) is defined on a region � then ∫�\n� (�) �� is path independent\nin �, if it has the same value for any two paths in � with the same endpoints.\nThe following theorem follows directly from the fundamental theorem. The proof uses the same\nargument as Example 3.7.\nTheorem 3.8. If � (�) has an antiderivative in an open region �, then the path integral ∫�\n� (�) �� is\npath independent for all paths in �.\nProof. Since � (�) has an antiderivative of � (�), the fundamental theorem tells us that the integral\nonly depends on the endpoints of �, i.e.\n� (�) �� = � (�1) - � (�0)\n∫�\nwhere �0 and �1 are the beginning and end point of �.\nAn alternative way to express path independence uses closed paths.\nTheorem 3.9. The following two things are equivalent.\n\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\n1. The integral ∫�\n� (�) �� is path independent.\n2. The integral ∫�\n� (�) �� around any closed path is 0.\nProof. This is essentially identical to the equivalent multivariable proof. We have to show two\nthings:\n(i) Path independence implies the line integral around any closed path is 0.\n(ii) If the line integral around all closed paths is 0 then we have path independence.\nTo see (i), assume path independence and consider the closed path � shown in figure (i) below. Since\nthe starting point �0 is the same as the endpoint �1 the line integral ∫�\n� (�) �� must have the same\nvalue as the line integral over the curve consisting of the single point �0. Since that is clearly 0 we\nmust have the integral over � is 0.\nTo see (ii), assume ∫�\n� (�) �� = 0 for any closed curve. Consider the two curves �1 and �2 shown\nin figure (ii). Both start at �0 and end at �1. By the assumption that integrals over closed paths are\n0 we have ∫�1-�2\n� (�) �� = 0. So,\n� (�) �� = ∫�2\n� (�) ��.\n∫�1\nThat is, any two paths from �0 to �1 have the same line integral. This shows that the line integrals\nare path independent.\nx\ny\nCc\nP = Q\nFigure (i)\nx\ny\nC2\nC1\nP\nQ\nFigure (ii)\n3.5 Examples\nExample 3.10. Why can't we compute ∫�\n��� using the fundamental theorem.\nSolution: Because � doesn't have an antiderivative. We can also see this by noting that if � had an\nantiderivative, then its integral around the unit circle would have to be 0. But, we saw in Example\n3.4 that this is not the case.\nExample 3.11. Compute ∫�\n�� over each of the following contours\n�\n(i) The line from 1 to 1 + �.\n\n||\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\n(ii) The circle of radius 1 around � = 3.\n(iii) The unit circle.\nSolution: For parts (i) and (ii) there is no problem using the antiderivative log(�) because these\ncurves are contained in a simply connected region that doesn't contain the origin.\n(i)\n√\n�\n�� = log(1 + �) - log(1) = log( 2) + � 4 .\n�\n∫�\n(ii) Since the beginning and end points are the same, we get\n1 �� = 0\n�\n∫�\n(iii) We parametrize the unit circle by �(�) = e�� with 0 ≤ � ≤ 2�. We compute � ′(�) = �e��. So the\nintegral becomes\n2�\n2�\n�� = ∫\n�e�� �� = ∫\n� �� = 2��.\ne��\n�\n∫�\nNotice that we could use log(�) if we were careful to let the argument increase by 2� as it went\naround the origin once.\nExample 3.12. Compute ∫�\n��, where � is the unit circle in two ways.\n�2\n(i) Using the fundamental theorem.\n(ii) Directly from the definition.\nSolution: (i) Let � (�) = -1∕�. Since � ′(�) = 1∕�2, the fundamental theorem says\n1 �� = ∫�\n� ′(�) �� = � (endpoint) - � (start point) = 0.\n∫� �2\nIt equals 0 because the start and endpoints are the same.\n(ii) As usual, we parametrize the unit circle as �(�) = e�� with 0 ≤ � ≤ 2�. So, � ′(�) = �e�� and the\nintegral becomes\n2�\n2�\n2�\n�2 �� = ∫\n�e�� �� = ∫\n�e-�� �� = -e-��\n= 0.\n∫�\ne2��\n|0\n3.6 Cauchy's theorem\nCauchy's theorem is analogous to Green's theorem for curl free vector fields.\nTheorem 3.13. (Cauchy's theorem) Suppose � is a simply connected region, � (�) is analytic on �\nand � is a simple closed curve in �. Then the following three things hold:\n(i) ∫�\n� (�) �� = 0\n(i′) We can drop the requirement that � is simple in part (i).\n(ii) Integrals of � on paths within � are path independent. That is, two paths with the same endpoints\nintegrate to the same value.\n\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\n(iii) � has an antiderivative in �.\nProof. We will prove (i) using Green's theorem - we could give a proof that didn't rely on Green's,\nbut it would be quite similar in flavor to the proof of Green's theorem.\nLet � be the region inside the curve. And write � = � + ��. Now we write out the integral as follows\n� (�) �� = ∫�\n(� + ��) (�� + ���) = ∫�\n(� �� - � ��) + �(� �� + � ��).\n∫�\nLet's apply Green's theorem to the real and imaginary pieces separately. First the real piece:\n� �� - � �� = ∫�\n(-�� - ��) �� �� = 0.\n∫�\nWe get 0 because the Cauchy-Riemann equations say �� = -��, so -�� - �� = 0.\nLikewise for the imaginary piece:\n� �� + � �� = ∫�\n(�� - ��) �� �� = 0.\n∫�\nWe get 0 because the Cauchy-Riemann equations say �� = ��, so �� - �� = 0.\nTo see part (i′) you should draw a few curves that intersect themselves and convince yourself that\nthey can be broken into a sum of simple closed curves. Thus, (i′) follows from (i).1\nPart (ii) follows from (i) and Theorem 3.9.\nTo see (iii), pick a base point �0 ∈ � and let\n�\n� (�) = ∫\n� (�) ��.\n�0\nHere the integral is over any path in � connecting �0 to �. By part (ii), � (�) is well defined. If we\ncan show that � ′(�) = � (�) then we'll be done. Doing this amounts to managing the notation to\napply the fundamental theorem of calculus and the Cauchy-Riemann equations. So, let's write\n� (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �),\n� (�) = �(�, �) + �� (�, �).\nThen we can write\n�� = �� + ���, etc.\n��\nWe can formulate the Cauchy-Riemann equations for � (�) as\n��\n1 ��\n� ′(�) =\n=\n(2a)\n��\n� ��\ni.e.\n� ′(�) = �� + ��� = 1(�� + ���) = �� - ���.\n(2b)\n�\n1In order to truly prove part (i′) we would need a more technically precise definition of simply connected so we could\nsay that all closed curves within � can be continuously deformed to each other.\n\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\nFor reference, we note that using the path �(�) = �(�) + ��(�), with �(0) = �0 and �(�) = � we have\n�\n�\n� (�) = ∫\n� (�) �� = ∫ (�(�, �) + ��(�, �))(�� + ���)\n�0\n�0\n�\n= ∫ (�(�(�), �(�)) + ��(�(�), �(�))(� ′(�) + �� ′(�)) ��.\n(3)\nOur goal now is to prove that the Cauchy-Riemann equations given in Equation 3 hold for � (�). The\nfigure below shows an arbitrary path from �0 to �, which can be used to compute � (�). To compute\nthe partials of � we'll need the straight lines that continue � to � + h or � + �h.\nA\nz0\nz\nz + h\nz + ih\nC\nCx\nCy\nPaths for proof of Cauchy's theorem\nTo prepare the rest of the argument we remind you that the fundamental theorem of calculus implies\n∫ h �(�) ��\nlim\n= �(0).\n(4)\nh→0\nh\n(That is, the derivative of the integral is the original function.)\nFirst we'll look at �� . So, fix � = � + ��. Looking at the paths in the figure above we have\n��\n� (� + h) - � (�) = ∫�+��\n� (�) �� - ∫�\n� (�) �� = ∫��\n� (�) ��.\nThe curve �� is parametrized by �(�) = � + � + ��, with 0 ≤ � ≤ h. So,\n��\n� (� + h) - � (�)\n∫�� � (�) ��\n= lim\n= lim\n��\nh→0\nh\nh→0\nh\n∫0\nh �(� + �, �) + ��(� + �, �) ��\n= lim\nh→0\nh\n= �(�, �) + ��(�, �)\n= � (�).\n(5)\nThe second to last equality follows from Equation 4.\n\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\nSimilarly, we get (remember: � = � + ��, so �� = � ��)\n1 ��\n� (� + �h) - � (�)\n∫�� � (�) ��\n= lim\n= lim\n� ��\nh→0\n�h\nh→0\n�h\n∫ h �(�, � + �) + ��(�, � + �) � ��\n= lim\nh→0\n�h\n= �(�, �) + ��(�, �)\n= � (�).\n(6)\nTogether Equations 5 and 6 show\n��\n1 ��\n� (�) =\n=\n��\n� ��\n′\nBy Equation 2a we have shown that � is analytic and � = � . □\n3.7 Extensions of Cauchy's theorem\nCauchy's theorem requires that the function � (�) be analytic on a simply connected region. In cases\nwhere it is not, we can extend it in a useful way.\nSuppose � is the region between the two simple closed curves �1 and �2. Note, both �1 and �2 are\noriented in a counterclockwise direction.\nTheorem 3.14. (Extended Cauchy's theorem) If � (�) is analytic on � then\n� (�) �� = 0.\n∫�1-�2\nProof. The proof is based on the following figure. We 'cut' both �1 and �2 and connect them by two\ncopies of �3, one in each direction. (In the figure we have drawn the two copies of �3 as separate\ncurves, in reality they are the same curve traversed in opposite directions.)\nWith �3 acting as a cut, the region enclosed by �1 + �3 - �2 - �3 is simply connected, so Cauchy's\nTheorem 3.13 applies. We get\n� (�) �� = 0\n∫�1+�3-�2-�3\n\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\nThe contributions of �3 and -�3 cancel, which leaves ∫�1-�2\n� (�) �� = 0. QED\nNote. This clearly implies ∫�1\n� (�) �� = ∫�2\n� (�) ��.\nExample 3.15. Let � (�) = 1∕�. � (�) is defined and analytic on the punctured plane.\nx\ny\nPunctured plane: � - {0}\nQuestion: What values can ∫�\n� (�) �� take for � a simple closed curve (positively oriented) in\nthe plane?\nSolution: We have two cases (i) �1 not around 0, and (ii) �2 around 0\nx\ny\nC1\nR\nC2\nCase (i): Cauchy's theorem applies directly because the interior does not contain the problem point\nat the origin. Thus,\n� (�) �� = 0.\n∫�1\nCase (ii): we will show that\n� (�) �� = 2��.\n∫�2\nLet �3 be a small circle of radius � centered at 0 and entirely inside �2.\nx\ny\nC2\nC3\nR\nFigure for part (ii)\n\n3 LINE INTEGRALS AND CAUCHY'S THEOREM\nBy the extended Cauchy theorem we have\n2�\n� (�) �� = ∫�3\n� (�) �� = ∫\n� �� = 2��.\n∫�2\nHere, the line integral for �3 was computed directly using the usual parametrization of a circle.\nAnswer to the question: The only possible values are 0 and 2��.\nWe can extend this answer in the following way:\nIf � is not simple, then the possible values of\n� (�) ��\n∫�\nare 2���, where � is the number of times � goes (counterclockwise) around the origin 0.\nDefinition. � is called the winding number of � around 0. � also equals the number of times �\ncrosses the positive �-axis, counting +1 for crossing from below and -1 for crossing from above.\nx\ny\nC\nA curve with winding number 2 around the origin.\nExample 3.16. A further extension: using the same trick of cutting the region by curves to make it\nsimply connected we can show that if � is analytic in the region � shown below then\n� (�) �� = 0.\n∫�1-�2-�3-�4\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC4\nR\nThat is, �1 - �2 - �3 - �4 is the boundary of the region �.\nOrientation. It is important to get the orientation of the curves correct. One way to do this is to\nmake sure that the region � is always to the left as you traverse the curve. In the above example.\nThe region is to the right as you traverse �2, �3 or �4 in the direction indicated. This is why we put\na minus sign on each when describing the boundary.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

More will follow as\nthe course progresses.\nIf you learn just one theorem this week it should be Cauchy's integral formula!\nWe start with a statement of the theorem for functions.

(A second extension of Cauchy's theorem) Suppose that � is a simply connected\nregion containing the point �0. Suppose � is a function which is\n1. Analytic on � -{�0}\n2. Continuous on �. (In particular, � does not blow up at �0.)\nThen,\n�(�) �� = 0\n∫�\nfor all closed curves � in �.\nProof.

Using this, we can show that �(�) is, in fact, analytic at �0. The proof will be the same as in\nour proof of Cauchy's theorem that �(�) has an antiderivative.\n4.4.2 Proof of Cauchy's integral formula\n� (�)\nWe reiterate Cauchy's integral formula from Equation 1:\n� (�0) =\n��.\n2�� ∫� � - �0\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nz0\nC\nA\nProof.

Since the derivative of �\nexists at �0, we know that\nlim �(�) = � ′(�0).\n�→�0\n\n4 CAUCHY'S INTEGRAL FORMULA\nThat is, if we define �(�0) = � ′(�0) then � is continuous at �0. From the extension of Cauchy's\ntheorem just above, we have\n� (�) - � (�0)\n�(�) �� = 0,\ni.e.\n�� = 0.\n∫�\n∫�\n� - �0\nThus\n� (�)\n� (�0)\n�� = ∫�\n�� = � (�0) ∫�\n�� = 2��� (�0).\n∫� � - �0\n� - �0\n� - �0\nThe last equality follows from our, by now, well known integral of 1∕(� - �0) on a loop around �0.\n4.5 Proof of Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives\nRecall that Cauchy's integral formula in Equation 3 says\n�!\n� (�)\n� (�)(�) =\n��,\n� = 0, 1, 2, ...\n2�� ∫� (� - �)�+1\nFirst we'll offer a quick proof which captures the reason behind the formula, and then a formal proof.\nQuick proof: We have an integral representation for � (�), � ∈ �, we use that to find an integral\nrepresentation for � ′(�), � ∈ �.\n[\n]\n(\n)\n�\n� (�)\n�\n� (�)\n� (�)\n� ′(�) =\n�� =\n�� =\n��\n�� 2�� ∫� � - �\n2�� ∫� ��\n� - �\n2�� ∫� (� - �)2\n(Note, since � ∈ � and � ∈ �, we know that � - � = 0) Thus,\n� (�)\n� ′(�) =\n��\n2�� ∫� (� - �)2\nNow, by iterating this process, i.e. by mathematical induction, we can show the formula for higher\norder derivatives.\nFormal proof: We do this by taking the limit of\n� (� + Δ�) - � (�)\nlim\nΔ�→0\nΔ�\nusing the integral representation of both terms:\n� (�)\n� (�)\n� (� + Δ�) =\n��,\n� (�) =\n��\n2�� ∫� � - � -Δ�\n2�� ∫� � - �\nNow, using a little algebraic manipulation we get\n� (� + Δ�) - � (�)\n� (�)\n� (�)\n=\n-\n��\nΔ�\n2�� Δ� ∫� � - � -Δ�\n� - �\n� (�)Δ�\n=\n��\n2�� Δ� ∫� (� - � -Δ�)(� - �)\n� (�)\n=\n��\n2�� ∫� (� - �)2 -Δ�(� - �)\nLetting Δ� go to 0, we get Cauchy's formula for � ′(�):\n� (�)\n� ′(�) = 1\n��\n2�� ∫� (� - �)2\nThere is no problem taking the limit under the integral sign because everything is continuous and\nthe denominator is never 0. □\n\n4 CAUCHY'S INTEGRAL FORMULA\n4.6 Amazing consequence of Cauchy's integral formula\n4.6.1 Existence of derivatives\nTheorem. Suppose � (�) is analytic on a region �. Then, � has derivatives of all order.\nProof. This follows from Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives. That is, we have a formula for\nall the derivatives, so in particular the derivatives all exist.\nA little more precisely: for any point � in � we can put a small disk around �0 that is entirely\ncontained in �. Let � be the boundary of the disk, then Cauchy's formula gives a formula for all the\nderivatives � (�)(�0) in terms of integrals over �. In particular, those derivatives exist. □\nRemark. If you look at the proof of Cauchy's formula for derivatives you'll see that � having\nderivatives of all orders boils down to 1∕(� - �) having derivatives of all orders for � on a curve\nnot containing �.\nImportant remark. We have at times assumed that for � = � + �� analytic, � and � have continuous\nhigher order partial derivatives. This theorem confirms that fact. In particular, ��� = ���, etc.\n4.6.2 Cauchy's inequality\nTheorem 4.15. (Cauchy's inequality) Let �� be the circle |�-�0| = �. Assume that � (�) is analytic\non �� and its interior, i.e. on the disk |� - �0| ≤ �. Finally let �� = max |� (�)| over � on ��.\nThen\n|� (�)(�0)| ≤ �!�� ,\n� = 1, 2, 3, ...\n(6)\n��\nProof. Using Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives (Equation 3) we have\n|� (�)|\n��\n�! ��\n|� (�)(�0)| ≤ �!\n|��| ≤ �!\n|��| =\n⋅ 2��\n|� - �0|�+1\n2�\n2� ��+1\n2� ∫��\n��+1 ∫��\n4.6.3 Liouville's theorem\nTheorem 4.16. (Liouville's theorem) Assume � (�) is entire and suppose it is bounded in the complex\nplane, namely |� (�)| < � for all � ∈ � then � (�) is constant.\nProof. For any circle of radius � around �0 the Cauchy inequality says |� ′(�0)| ≤ � . But, � can\n�\nbe as large as we like so we conclude that |� ′(�0)| = 0 for every �0 ∈ �. Since the derivative is 0,\nthe function itself is constant.\nIn short:\nIf � is entire and bounded then � is constant.\nNote. � (�) = ���� + ... + �0, sin(�), e� are all entire but not bounded.\nNow, practically for free, we get the fundamental theorem of algebra.\nCorollary. (Fundamental theorem of algebra) Any polynomial � of degree � ≥ 1, i.e.\n� (�) = �0 + �1� + ... + ����, �� = 0,\n\n4 CAUCHY'S INTEGRAL FORMULA\nhas exactly � roots.\nProof. There are two parts to the proof.\nHard part: Show that � has at least one root.\nThis is done by contradiction, together with Liouville's theorem. Suppose � (�) does not have a\nzero. Then\n1. � (�) = 1∕� (�) is entire. This is obvious because (by assumption) � (�) has no zeros.\n2. � (�) is bounded. This follows because 1∕� (�) goes to 0 as |�| goes to inf.\nIm(z)\nIm(z)\nR\nCR\nM = max of |1/P(z)| in here.\n|1/P(z)| small out here.\n(It is clear that |1∕� (�)| goes to 0 as � goes to infinity, i.e. |1∕� (�)| is small outside a large circle.\nSo |1∕� (�)| is bounded by �.)\nSo, by Liouville's theorem � (�) is constant, and therefore � (�) must be constant as well. But this is\na contradiction, so the hypothesis of \"No zeros\" must be wrong, i.e. � must have a zero.\nEasy part: � has exactly � zeros. Let �0 be one zero. We can factor � (�) = (� - �0)�(�). �(�) has\ndegree � -1. If � -1 > 0, then we can apply the result to �(�). We can continue this process until\nthe degree of � is 0.\n4.6.4 Maximum modulus principle\nBriefly, the maximum modulus principle states that if � is analytic and not constant in a domain �\nthen |� (�)| has no relative maximum in � and the absolute maximum of |� | occurs on the boundary\nof �.\nIn order to prove the maximum modulus principle we will first prove the mean value property. This\nwill give you a good feel for the maximum modulus principle. It is also important and interesting in\nits own right.\nTheorem 4.17. (Mean value property) Suppose � (�) is analytic on the closed disk of radius � cen\ntered at �0, i.e. the set |� - �0| ≤ �. Then,\n2�\n� (�0) = 1\n� (�0 + �e��) ��\n(7)\n2� ∫0\n\n|\n|\n||\n||\n4 CAUCHY'S INTEGRAL FORMULA\nProof. This is an application of Cauchy's integral formula on the disk\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nz0\nr\nCr\n�� = |� - �0| ≤ �.\nWe can parametrize ��, the boundary of ��, as\n�(�) = �0 + �e��, with 0 ≤ � ≤ 2�, so � ′(�) = ��e��.\nBy Cauchy's formula we have\n2� � (�0 + �e��)\n2�\n� (�)\n� (�0) =\n�� =\n��e�� �� =\n� (�0 + �e��) ��\n�e��\n2�� ∫�� � - �0\n2�� ∫\n2� ∫0\nThis proves the property. □\nIn words, the mean value property says � (�0) is the arithmetic mean of the values on the circle.\nNow we can state and prove the maximum modulus principle. We state the assumptions carefully.\nWhen applying this theorem, it is important to verify that the assumptions are satisfied.\nTheorem 4.18. (Maximum modulus principle) Suppose � (�) is analytic in a connected region �\nand �0 is a point in �.\n1. If |� | has a relative maximum at �0 then � (�) is constant in a neighborhood of �0.\n2. If � is bounded and connected, and � is continuous on � and its boundary, then either � is\nconstant or the absolute maximum of |� | occurs only on the boundary of �.\nProof. Part (1): The argument for part (1) is a little fussy. We will use the mean value property and\nthe triangle inequality from Theorem 4.11.\nSince �0 is a relative maximum of |� |, for every small enough circle � ∶ |� - �0| = � around �0 we\nhave |� (�)| ≤ |� (�0)| for � on �. Therefore, by the mean value property and the triangle inequality\n2�\n|� (�0)| = | 1\n|\n(mean value property)\n� (�0 + �e��) ��\n2� ∫ 0\n2�\n|\n|\n≤\n|� (�0 + �e��)| ��\n(triangle inequality)\n2� ∫0\n2�\n≤ 1\n|� (�0)| ��\n(|� (�0 + �e��)| ≤ |� (�0)|)\n2� ∫0\n= |� (�0)|\nSince the beginning and end of the above are both |� (�0)| all the inequalities in the chain must be\nequalities.\n\n4 CAUCHY'S INTEGRAL FORMULA\nThe first inequality can only be an equality if for all �, � (�0 + �e��) lie on the same ray from the\norigin, i.e. have the same argument or are 0.\nThe second inequality can only be an equality if all |� (�0 + �e��)| = |� (�0)|. So we have all � (�0 +\n�e��) have the same magnitude and the same argumeny. This implies they are all the same.\nFinally, if � (�) is constant along the circle and � (�0) is the average of � (�) over the circle then\n� (�) = � (�0), i.e. � is constant on a small disk around �0.\nPart (2): The assumptions that � is bounded and � is continuous on � and its boundary serve to\nguarantee that |� | has an absolute maximum (on � combined with its boundary). Part (1) guarantees\nthat the absolute maximum can not lie in the interior of the region � unless � is constant. (This\nrequires a bit more argument. Do you see why?) If the absolute maximum is not in the interior it\nmust be on the boundary. □\nExample 4.19. Find the maximum modulus of e� on the unit square with 0 ≤ �, � ≤ 1.\nSolution:\n|e�+��| = e� ,\nso the maximum is when � = 1, 0 ≤ � ≤ 1 is arbitrary. This is indeed on the boundary of the unit\nsquare\nExample 4.20. Find the maximum modulus for sin(�) on the square [0, 2�] × [0, 2�].\nSolution: We use the formula\nsin(�) = sin � cosh � + � cos � sinh �.\nSo,\n| sin(�)|2 = sin2 � cosh2 � + cos2 � sinh2 �\n= sin2 � cosh2 � + (1 - sin2 �) sinh2 �\n= sin2 � + sinh2 �.\nWe know the maximum over � of sin2(�) is at � = �∕2 and � = 3�∕2. The maximum of sinh2 � is\nat � = 2�. So maximum modulus is\n√\n√\n1 + sinh2(2�) =\ncosh2(2�) = cosh(2�).\nThis occurs at the points\n�\n3�\n� = � + �� = 2 + 2��,\nand � = 2 + 2��.\nBoth these points are on the boundary of the region.\nExample 4.21. Suppose � (�) is entire. Show that if lim � (�) = 0 then � (�) ≡ 0.\n�→inf\nSolution: This is a standard use of the maximum modulus principle. The strategy is to show that\nthe maximum of |� (�)| is not on the boundary (of the appropriately chosen region), so � (�) must be\nconstant.\nFix �0. For � > |�0| let �� be the maximum of |� (�)| on the circle |�| = �. The maximum\nmodulus theorem says that |� (�0)| < ��. Since � (�) goes to 0, as � goes to infinity, we must have\n�� also goes to 0. This means |� (�0)| = 0. Since this is true for any �0, we have � (�) ≡ 0.\n\n4 CAUCHY'S INTEGRAL FORMULA\nExample 4.22. Here is an example of why you need � to be bounded in the maximum modulus\ntheorem. Let � be the upper half-plane\nIm(�) > 0.\nSo the boundary of � is the real axis.\nLet � (�) = e-��. We have\n|� (�)| = |e-��| = 1\nfor � along the real axis. Since |� (2�)| = |e2| > 1, we see |� | cannot take its maximum along the\nboundary of �.\nOf course, it can't take its maximum in the interior of � either. What happens here is that � (�)\ndoesn't have a maximum modulus. Indeed |� (�)| goes to infinity along the positive imaginary axis.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The key connection to 18.04 is that both the real and imaginary parts of analytic functions\nare harmonic. We will see that this is a simple consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. In\nthe next topic we will look at some applications to hydrodynamics.\n5.2 Harmonic functions\nWe start by defining harmonic functions and looking at some of their properties.\nDefinition 5.1. A function �(�, �) is called harmonic if it is twice continuously differentiable and\nsatisfies the following partial differential equation:\n∇2� = ��� + ��� = 0.\n(1)\nEquation 1 is called Laplace's equation. So a function is harmonic if it satisfies Laplace's equation.\nThe operator ∇2 is called the Laplacian and ∇2� is called the Laplacian of �.\n5.3 Del notation\nHere's a quick reminder on the use of the notation �. For a function �(�, �) and a vector field\n�(�, �) = (�, �), we have\n(\n)\n�\n�\n(i)\n� =\n,\n��\n��\n(ii)\ngrad � = �� = (��, ��)\n(iii)\ncurl � = � × � = (�� - ��)\n(iv)\ndiv � = � ⋅ � = �� + ��\n(v)\ndiv grad � = � ⋅ �� = ∇2� = ��� + ���\n(vi)\ncurl grad � = � × � � = 0\n(vii)\ndiv curl � = � ⋅ � × � = 0.\n\n5 INTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS\n5.3.1 Analytic functions have harmonic pieces\nThe connection between analytic and harmonic functions is very strong. In many respects it mirrors\nthe connection between e� and sine and cosine.\nLet � = � + �� and write � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �).\nTheorem 5.2. If � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �) is analytic on a region � then both � and � are harmonic\nfunctions on �.\nProof. This is a simple consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Since �� = �� we have\n��� = ���.\nLikewise, �� = -�� implies\n��� = -���.\nSince ��� = ��� we have\n��� + ��� = ��� - ��� = 0.\nTherefore � is harmonic. We can handle � similarly. □\nNote. Since we know an analytic function is infinitely differentiable we know � and � have the\nrequired two continuous partial derivatives. This also ensures that the mixed partials agree, i.e.\n��� = ���.\nTo complete the tight connection between analytic and harmonic functions we show that any har\nmonic function is the real part of an analytic function.\nTheorem 5.3. If �(�, �) is harmonic on a simply connected region �, then � is the real part of an\nanalytic function � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �).\nProof. This is similar to our proof that an analytic function has an antiderivative. First we come up\nwith a candidate for � (�) and then show it has the properties we need. Here are the details broken\ndown into steps 1-4.\n1. Find a candidate, call it �(�), for � ′(�):\n′\nIf we had an analytic � with � = � + ��, then Cauchy-Riemann says that � = �� - ���. So,\nlet's define\n� = �� - ���.\n′\nThis is our candidate for � .\n2. Show that �(�) is analytic:\nWrite � = � + ��, where � = �� and � = -��. Checking the Cauchy-Riemann equations we\nhave\n[\n]\n[\n]\n�� ��\n���\n���\n=\n�� ��\n-��� -���\nSince � is harmonic we know ��� = -���, so �� = ��. It is clear that �� = -��. Thus �\nsatisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, so it is analytic.\n3. Let � be an antiderivative of �:\n\n5 INTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS\nSince � is simply connected our statement of Cauchy's theorem guarantees that �(�) has an\nantiderivative in �. We'll need to fuss a little to get the constant of integration exactly right.\nSo, pick a base point �0 in �. Define the antiderivative of �(�) by\n�\n� (�) = ∫\n�(�) �� + �(�0, �0).\n�0\n(Again, by Cauchy's theorem this integral can be along any path in � from �0 to �.)\n4. Show that the real part of � is �.\nLet's write � = � + �� . So, � ′(�) = �� - ���. By construction\n� ′(�) = �(�) = �� - ���.\nThis means the first partials of � and � are the same, so � and � differ by at most a constant.\nHowever, also by construction,\n� (�0) = �(�0, �0) = �(�0, �0) + �� (�0, �0),\nSo, �(�0, �0) = �(�0, �0) (and � (�0, �0) = 0). Since they agree at one point we must have\n� = �, i.e. the real part of � is � as we wanted to prove.\nImportant corollary. � is infinitely differentiable.\nProof. By definition we only require a harmonic function � to have continuous second partials. Since\nthe analytic � is infinitely differentiable, we have shown that so is �!\n5.3.2 Harmonic conjugates\nDefinition. If � and � are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function, then we say � and �\nare harmonic conjugates.\nNote. If � (�) = � + �� is analytic then so is �� (�) = -� + ��. So, if � and � are harmonic conjugates\nand so are � and -�.\n5.4 A second proof that � and � are harmonic\nThis fact is important enough that we will give a second proof using Cauchy's integral formula.\nOne benefit of this proof is that it reminds us that Cauchy's integral formula can transfer a general\nquestion on analytic functions to a question about the function 1∕�. We start with an easy to derive\nfact.\nFact. The real and imaginary parts of � (�) = 1∕� are harmonic away from the origin. Likewise for\n�(�) = � (� - �) = � - �\naway from the point � = �.\nProof. We have\n�\n�\n=\n- �\n�\n�2 + �2\n�2 + �2 .\n\n5 INTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS\nIt is a simple matter to apply the Laplacian and see that you get 0. We'll leave the algebra to you!\nThe statement about �(�) follows in either exactly the same way, or by noting that the Laplacian is\ntranslation invariant.\nSecond proof that � analytic implies � and � are harmonic. We are proving that if � = � + �� is\nanalytic then � and � are harmonic. So, suppose � is analytic at the point �0. This means there is a\ndisk of some radius, say �, around �0 where � is analytic. Cauchy's formula says\n� (�)\n� (�) =\n��,\n2�� ∫�� � - �\nwhere �� is the circle |� - �0| = � and � is in the disk |� - �0| < �.\nNow, since the real and imaginary parts of 1∕(� - �) are harmonic, the same must be true of the\nintegral, which is limit of linear combinations of such functions. Since the circle is finite and � is\ncontinuous, interchanging the order of integration and differentiation is not a problem.\n5.5 Maximum principle and mean value property\nThese are similar to the corresponding properties of analytic functions. Indeed, we deduce them\nfrom those corresponding properties.\nTheorem. (Mean value property) If � is a harmonic function then � satisfies the mean value property.\nThat is, suppose � is harmonic on and inside a circle of radius � centered at �0 = �0 + ��0 then\n2�\n�(�0, �0) =\n�(�0 + �e��) ��\n2� ∫0\nProof. Let � = � + �� be an analytic function with � as its real part. The mean value property for �\nsays\n2�\n�(�0, �0) + ��(�0, �0) = � (�0) =\n� (�0 + �e��) ��\n2� ∫0\n2�\n�(�0 + �e��) + ��(�0 + �e��) ��\n= 2� ∫0\nLooking at the real parts of this equation proves the theorem.\nTheorem. (Maximum principle) Suppose �(�, �) is harmonic on a open region �.\n(i) Suppose �0 is in �. If � has a relative maximum or minimum at �0 then � is constant on a disk\ncentered at �0.\n(ii) If � is bounded and connected and � is continuous on the boundary of � then the absolute\nmaximum and absolute minimum of � occur on the boundary.\nProof. The proof for maxima is identical to the one for the maximum modulus principle. The proof\nfor minima comes by looking at the maxima of -�.\nNote. For analytic functions we only talked about maxima because we had to use the modulus in\norder to have real values. Since |-� | = |� | we couldn't use the trick of turning minima into maxima\nby using a minus sign.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS\n5.6 Orthogonality of curves\nAn important property of harmonic conjugates � and � is that their level curves are orthogonal. We\nstart by showing their gradients are orthogonal.\nLemma 5.4. Let � = � + �� and suppose that � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �) is analytic. Then the dot\nproduct of their gradients is 0, i.e.\n�� ⋅ �� = 0.\nProof. The proof is an easy application of the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n�� ⋅ �� = (��, ��) ⋅ (��, ��) = ���� + ���� = ���� - ���� = 0\nIn the last step we used the Cauchy-Riemann equations to substitute �� for �� and -�� for ��. □\nThe lemma holds whether or not the gradients are 0. To guarantee that the level curves are smooth\nthe next theorem requires that � ′(�) = 0.\nTheorem. Let � = � + �� and suppose that\n� (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �)\nis analytic. If � ′(�) = 0 then the level curve of � through (�, �) is orthogonal to the level curve �\nthrough (�, �).\nProof. The technical requirement that � ′(�) = 0 is needed to be sure that the level curves are smooth.\nWe need smoothness so that it even makes sense to ask if the curves are orthogonal. We'll discuss\nthis below. Assuming the curves are smooth the proof of the theorem is trivial: We know from\n18.02 that the gradient �� is orthogonal to the level curves of � and the same is true for �� and\nthe level curves of �. Since, by Lemma 5.4, the gradients are orthogonal this implies the curves are\northogonal.\nFinally, we show that � ′(�) = 0 means the curves are smooth. First note that\n� ′(�) = ��(�, �) - ���(�, �) = ��(�, �) + ���(�, �).\nNow, since � ′(�) = 0 we know that\n�� = (��, ��) = 0.\nLikewise, �� = 0. Thus, the gradients are not zero and the level curves must be smooth.\nExample 5.5. The figures below show level curves of � and � for a number of functions. In all cases,\nthe level curves of � are in orange and those of � are in blue. For each case we show the level curves\nseparately and then overlayed on each other.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS\n\nINTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS\nExample 5.6. Let's work out the gradients in a few simple examples.\n(i) Let\n� (�) = �2 = (�2 - �2) + �2��,\nSo\n�� = (2�, -2�)\nand\n�� = (2�, 2�).\nIt's trivial to check that �� ⋅ �� = 0, so they are orthogonal.\n\n5 INTRODUCTION TO HARMONIC FUNCTIONS\n(ii) Let\n�\n�\n� (�) =\n=\n- �\n�\n�2\n�2 .\nSo, it's easy to compute\n(\n)\n(\n)\n�2 - �2 -2��\n2�� �2 - �2\n�� =\n,\nand\n�� =\n,\n.\n�4\n�4\n�4\n�4\nAgain it's trivial to check that �� ⋅ �� = 0, so they are orthogonal.\nExample 5.7. (Degenerate points: � ′(�) = 0.) Consider\n� (�) = �2 .\nFrom the previous example we have\n�(�, �) = �2 - �2 ,\n�(�, �) = 2��,\n�� = (2�, -2�),\n�� = (2�, 2�).\nAt � = 0, the gradients are both 0 so the theorem on orthogonality doesn't apply.\nLet's look at the level curves through the origin. The level curve (really the 'level set') for\n� = �2 - �2 = 0\nis the pair of lines � = ±�. At the origin this is not a smooth curve.\nLook at the figures for �2 above. It does appear that away from the origin the level curves of �\nintersect the lines where � = 0 at right angles. The same is true for the level curves of � and the lines\nwhere � = 0. You can see the degeneracy forming at the origin: as the level curves head towards 0\nthey get pointier and more right angled. So the level curve � = 0 is more properly thought of as four\nright angles. The level curve of � = 0, not knowing which leg of � = 0 to intersect orthogonally\ntakes the average and comes into the origin at 45*.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

So as t grow the magnitude grows exponentially and the argument\nincreases. This gives a spiral!\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nNote, this is not to scale. The exponential et grows too quickly, so we drew e0.2t instead.\nQualitatively this is a good representation of the curve.\n(b) Consider the mapping z → w = z2. Draw the image in the w-plane of the triangular\nregion in the z-plane with vertices 0, 1 and i.\nSolution: The figure shows the image.\nIn brief we have: z = 1 ↦ w = 1, z = (1 + i)/2 ↦ w = i/2, z = i↦w = -1.\nThe sides of the triangle map as follows:\nthe line segment [0, 1] ↦ the line segment [0, 1]\nthe line segment [0, i] ↦ the line segment [0, -1]\nthe line segment [1, i] ↦ the parabola shown in the figure (proved below).\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\n(1 + i)/2\ni\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\n-1\n0.5i\nz 7→w = z2\nIt takes a small amount of algebra to find the equation for the image of the segment\nfrom 1 to i. We parametrize the segment as z = (1 -t) + ti with 0 ≤t ≤ 1. Then\nw= z2 = (1 -2t) + 2t(1 -t)i. As a curve in the plane this is\nw = (u(t), v(t)), where u(t) = 1 - 2t and v(t) = 2t(1 - t).\nA little more algebra shows that t = (1 -u)/2 and therefore v = -u2 + 1/2. This is the\n\n18.04 Problem Set 1, Spring 2018 Solutions\nformula for the parabola shown.\nProblem 4. (10 points)\nLet zk = e2πi/n.

Use that to factor it into a linear term and\na degree n - 1 term.\nSolution: The nth roots of 1 are all the roots of the equation zn-1 = 0. Since we know\nthat z = 1 is a root we can factor the equation as\n(z -1)(zn-1 + zn-2 + ... + z + 1) = 0\nSince zk is also a root of zn -1 and zk =1, we must have zk is a root of the second factor.\nThis is what we were asked to show!\nProblem 5. (20: 10,10 points) (Orthogonal lines stay orthogonal!)\n(a) Consider the mapping w = ez.\n(i) Sketch in the w-plane the image under this mapping of vertical lines in the z-plane.\n(ii) On the same graph sketch the image of horizontal lines.\nShow enough lines to give a good idea of what's happening.\n(iii) Show (argue either geometrically or analytically) that the images of a vertical and a\nhorizontal lines meet at right angles.\nSolution: (i) As usual, let z = x+ iy. Vertical line have the equation x = a for some\nconstant a. We can parametrize this line by z = a+ iy, with -inf< y < inf. The image of\nthe line under the mapping is\nw = ea+iy = eaeiy.\nThus |w| = ea is constant, so the image is a circle of radius ea centered on 0.\n(ii) Likewise, horizontal lines have the equation y = b for some constant b. We parametrize\nthis by z = x+ ib, with -inf < x < inf. The image of the line under this mapping is\nw = ex+ib = exeib.\nThus arg(w) = b is constant, so the image is a ray from the origin at angle b.\nIn the figure below we label the corresponding curves with the same label. So, for example,\nthe image of the vertical line lv4 is the circle in the w-plane labeled lv4\n\n18.04 Problem Set 1, Spring 2018 Solutions\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nlv1\nlv2\nlv3\nlv4\nlh1\nlh2\nlh3\nlh4\nlh5\nlh6\nlh7\nlh8\n-1\n1/2\nπ/4 i\nπ/2 i\n3π/4 i\nπ i\n-3π/4 i\n-π/2 i\n-π/4 i\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\nlv1\nlv2\nlv3\nlv4\nlh1\nlh2\nlh3\nlh4\nlh5\nlh6\nlh7\nlh8\nz 7→w = ez\n(iii) The images found in parts (i) and (ii) are circles and rays. Geometrically we know\nthat radii are perpendicular to circles, so rays from the origin are perpendicular to circles\ncentered on the origin.\n(b) Repeat part (a) for the mapping w = z2.\nSolution: This part is similar to part (a), though we will need a little more algebraic\nmanipulation to identify the image curves.\n(i) The vertical line x = a is parametrized by z = a+ iy, with -inf < y < inf. So the image\nis w = a2 -y2 + i2ay. Let's write this as w = u+ iv. It is easy to see that with u = a2 -y2\nand v = 2ay we have\nu = a2 - (v/2a)2.\nThis is a parabola in the uv-plane which opens to the left and has vertex at (a2, 0).\n(ii) Horizontal lines y = b are similar:\nParametrization: z = x+ ib, with -inf < x < inf.\nImage: w = x2 - b2 + i2bx.\nIf w = u+ iv then u = (v/2b)2 - b2. This is a parabola opening to the right with vertex at\n(-b2, 0).\nThe figure below is labeled in the same way as the figure in part (a). Notice the vertical\nlines x = a and x = -a map to the same parabola as befits the 2-to-1 mapping w = z2.\nThe real z-axis (x = 0) maps to the positive real w-axis (u > 0). We can view this as a\ndegenerate parabola. Likewise for the imaginary z-axis.\nRe(z)\nIm(z)\nlv1\nlv2\nlv3\nlv4\nlv5\nlh1\nlh2\nlh3\nlh4\nlh5\n-1\n-1\nRe(w)\nIm(w)\nlv2, lv4\nlv1, lv5\nlh2, lh4\nlh1, lh5\nlh3\nlv3\nz 7→w = z2\n(iii) To show the image curves are orthogonal (meet at right angles) we need to show that\ntheir tangent vectors are orthogonal. Happily, we've parametrized the image curves in parts\n(i) and (ii), so computing tangent vectors is easy. In keeping with the course we will write\nvectors as x + iy rather than in 18.02 notation as ⟨x, y⟩\n\n18.04 Problem Set 1, Spring 2018 Solutions\nHorizontal line: z = a+iy; image w = a2-y2+i2ay; image tangent vector: dw = -2y+i2a.\nVertical line: z = x+ ib; image w = x2 - b2 + i2xb; image tangent vector:\ndy\ndw = 2x + i2b.\ndx\nThe lines meet at the point a + ib, so we need to check the tangents at that point.\nHorizontal line image: dw = -2b + i2a\nVertical line image: dw\ndy\n= 2a + i2b\ndx\nIt is easy to see that these are orthogonal. For 18.04 the nicest way to say this is to note\nthat -2b + i2a = i(2a + i2b). Since multiplication by i is rotation by 90∘ the vectors are at\nright angles.\nExtra problems not for points\nProblem 6. (0 points) Find all points where\nArg (z -1\nz + 2) = ±π\nHint: let w = (z-1)/z+ 2). What does the condition say about the relation between w and\nw? Be careful to note points where Arg(w) is not defined.\nSolution: Answer: the set of points is the circle |z + 1/2| = 3/2, excluding the points z = 1\nand z = -2 where arg(w) is not defined.\nJustification. Arg(w) = ±π/2 means that w is on the imaginary axis (and w = 0). Thus\nwe must have\nz -1\nw= z+ 2 = ib, where b = 0 is real.\n2ib + 1\nSolving for z we get z = -ib + 1.\nWe can view this as a mapping b ↦ z from the real b-line to the complex z-plane. A tiny\namount of algebra gives\n2ib+ 1\nz = -ib+ 1 = -ib+ 1 -2.\nIgnoring the scale by 3 and the shift by -2 for the moment we have:\nClaim. The image of w = -ib+1 where b is real is the circle |w - 1/2| = 1/2, i.e. the circle\nwith radius 1/2 and center 1/2.\nProof.\n1 + bi\n|w-1/2| = ∣\n∣\n∣= 2.\n-ib + 1 - 1/2∣ = 2(1 - bi)\n(The last equality follow from problem 2c.)\nSince z = 3w-2 we have the z-image is the circle of radius 3/2 with center 3/2-2 = -1/2.\nz -1\nAlternative solution. w = (z-1)/(z+ 2) is pure imaginary, so w = -w, i.e.\n=\nz + 2\n-z -1\nz + 2. A little algebra gives 2|z|2 + z + z = 4.\nLet z = x+ iy. The above becomes 2(x2 + y2) + 2x = 4 or x2 + y2 + x = 4. Completing the\nsquare gives (x + 1/2)2 + y2 = 9/4. That is |z + 1/2|2 = 9/4.\n\n18.04 Problem Set 1, Spring 2018 Solutions\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Compute its\nderivative and show it equals - sin(z).\nWe'll do this two ways, first from the definition of cos(z) in terms of exponentials. Second,\nwe'll write cos(z) as a function of x and y and verify the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\nMethod 1. By definition cos(z) = eiz +\ne-iz\n, so cos(z) is entire because both eiz and e-iz\nare entire. Its derivative is\nd cos(z)\nieiz - ie-iz\n-eiz + e-iz\n=\n=\n= - sin(z)\ndz\n2i\nMethod 2.

Compute its derivative.\nSince cot(z) = cos(z)\nsin(z) is the quotient of entire functions it is analytic for all z except where\nsin(z) = 0. We know sin(z) = 0 for all multiples of π. To see that this is all the zeros of sin\nwe use the formula\nsin(z) = sin(x) cosh(y) + i cos(x) sinh(y)\nSince cosh(y) is never 0, the real part of sin(z) is only 0 where sin(x) = 0, where x = nπ\nfor some integer n. Since cos(nπ) = 0, the imaginary part of sin(z) is only 0 if sinh(y) = 0.\nThis only happens when y = 0 Therefore, the zeros of sin(z) are at z = x+ iy = nπ.\nSo cot(z) is analytic on the set C - {nπ where n is an integer}.\nWe use the quotient rule to compute the derivative. Since the algebra will be identical to\nthe real case, we know the derivative will be - csc2(z):\nd cot(z) = dz\nd (cos(z)\n- sin(z) sin(z) - cos(z) cos(z) = -\nsin\n2(z)\n= - csc2(z).\ndz\nsin(z) ) =\nsin2(z)\n\n18.04 Problem Set 2, Spring 2018 Solutions\nProblem 2.

So, on any branch of log we'll have\nlog(e0) = log(e2πi) = log(1)\n\n18.04 Problem Set 2, Spring 2018 Solutions\nFor example, if we choose the principal branch of log the log(1) = 0, so log(e2πi) = 2πi.\nProblem 4.

Show that F2(z) = f(z) is not analytic unless f is constant.\nHint for both parts: Use the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\nThe tricky part of this problem is keeping the notation straight while we take partial deriva\ntives for use in the Cauchy-Riemann equations. So, for z = x+ iy, let's write\nf(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y).\n(a) Then\nF1(z) = f(z) = u(x, -y) -iv(x, -y).\nWe can write F1(z) = U1(x, y) + iV1(x, y), where U1(x, y) = u(x, -y) and V1(x, y) =\n-v(x, -y). Since f(z) is analytic the Cauchy-Riemann equations say that ux = vy and\nuy = -vx. To check the Cauchy-Riemann equations on F1 we take the partial derivatives\nof U1 and V1.

Thus, f(z)\nis not analytic for z = 0.\nNote: we could also have used the C-R equations on f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), where\nu(x, y) = x2 + y2 and v(x, y) = 0.\nProblem 6.

The principal branch of log(w) is defined on C -{negative real axis}. So we\nneed to exclude those z that put w = z2 -1 on the negative real axis.

Now we need to exclude those z that put\neither w = z + 1 or w = z -1 on the negative real axis. That is, our branch cut is the real\ninterval (-inf, 1].

This is because\nwe made two branch cuts: (-inf, -1] for √z + 1 and (-inf, 1) for\n√\nz -1. Thus the interval\n(-inf, -1] is covered twice and (-1, 1] just once. The square root function changes sign\nas z crosses from one side of a branch cut to the other. Thus each factor in the product\n√z + 1\n√\nz -1 changes sign as we cross (-inf, -1). This means the product doesn't change\nsign and we don't need that portion of the branch cuts!\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

We know this has the antiderivative F (z) = z3/3. There fore ∫C f(z) dz =\nF (z1)-F (z0), where z0 and z1 are the endpoints of the curve C. Since these points coincide,\nthe integral must be 0.\n(ii) This requires some algebraic manipulation. Let z = x+ iy.

So we can apply\nGreen's theorem to each part of the integral. (Here R is the interior of the simple closed\ncurve C.)\nReal part: ∫(x2 - y2) dx - 2xy dy. So, M = x2 -y2, N = -2xy.

Each of the two vertical segments on the left are of length 2π. So ez maps this\nsegment to a full circle minus the point ex+ix = ex+i(x+2π).

This shows T (iy) is on the unit circle. Since we know fractional linear\n√1 + y2\ntransformations map lines to lines or circles this shows the image of the y-axis must be the\nentire unit circle.\nTo see (3): (1) shows that one point in the right half-plane maps to the inside of the disk.\nThis implies the entire half-plane must do so also.\n(b) A fixed point z of a transformation T is one where T(z) = z.

We know that w1 = T (z1)\nhas a unique reflection w2 in this line. Since T -1 preserves symmetry, z1 and z2 = T -1(w2)\nare symmetric in S.

The first obvious guess is u(z) = Im(z/(1 - z2).\nBut this fails because z/(1-z2) has a singularity at z = 1.

If your transformation still doesn't transform u to the\ncorrect φ try composing with a rotation.\nSolution: Conveniently, the map found in problem 2a will work. Write w = T(z), so z is\nthe variable on the half-plane and w is the variable on the disk.

That is, if w = eiθ then we need to have\nφ(w) = sin(θ)/2.\nThe function Φ(w) = w is analytic, so φ(w) = 2\n1 Im(w) is harmonic. On the boundary of\nthe disk we have\nφ(eiθ) = 2 Im(eiθ) = 2 sin(θ).\nThis is exactly what is required by requirement (2) above.\n(d) Use the fractional linear transform to take φ back to u on the right half-plane.\nSolution: The relationship u(z) = φ(T (z)) gives\nu(z) = φ(z-1\n2 Im (z -1\nz+ 1) =\nz+ 1) .\nSo, using z = x+ iy\n2 Im ((x - 1) + iy\ny\nu(x, y) = 1\n(x+ 1) + iy ) = (x+ 1)2 + y2 .\n\n18.04 Problem Set 8, Spring 2018 Solutions\nProblem 4.

Finding such a T is straightforward. We start with T (w) =\n. This\nw + b\nis chosen so that T(inf) = -1.

Here we just use our standard transform from the upper half-plane to the disk:\nz -i\nT(w) =\n= T-1(e-iπ/4). Then we can transform the problem\nz + i . Let w1 = T-1(eiπ/4), w2\nto the half-plane with jumps in the boundary value at w1 and w2. Solve this in the same\nmanner as part (a) and transfer the solution back to the disk.

From that compute the stream function and sketch some streamlines. You can\ndo this by hand or with a package like Matlab or Mathematica.\nSolution: Here is the plot of some streamlines with a few velocity vectors added to show\nthe direction. The orange dot on the negative y-axis is the stagnation point.\nUniform flow with a vortex at 0. Here, U = 1, Q = 1.\nUniform flow has complex potential ΦU(z) = Uz, where U is the direction.\nA vortex at z = 2i has complex potential ΦV (z) = iQ log(z - 2i), where Q is a measure of\nthe circulation strength.\nTo avoid a lot of complicated arithmetic, let's set U = 1. So, the combined flow has complex\npotential Φ(z) = z + iQ log(z).\nLet z = x+ iy = reiθ, then\nΦ(z) = (x+iy)+iQ(log(|z -2i|)+i arg(z-2i)) = (x-Q arg(z -2i))+i(y +Q log(|z -2i|)).\nSo, the stream function is ψ = Im(Φ) = y + Q log(|z - 2i|) .\nTo plot some velocity vectors we used the fact the Φ′ = u-iv, where (u, v) is the velocity\nvector field.

In this case this there is only one stagnation point\nat z = -Qi + 2i.

Use the Milne-Thomson Theorem to make this\nflow go around the cylinder |z| = 1.

As\na bonus, on the left, we show uniform around a cylinder. Stagnation points are shown as\norange dots. The cylinder is shown as an orange circle. We include the streamlines inside\nthe cylinder because they look nice!\nIn the figures U = 1, Q = 1, V = 2i and R = 1.\nLeft: uniform flow around a cylinder. Right: uniform plus vortex around a cylinder.\nAs before, uniform flow has ΦU = Uz. A vortex around z = 2i has ΦV (z) = iQ log(z - 2i).\nSo uniform plus vortex has complex potential\nΦUV (z) = Uz + iQ log(z - 2i).\nThe Milne-Thomson circle theorem implies that this flow around a cylinder of radius R has\ncomplex potential\nΦ(z) = ΦUV (z) + ΦUV (R2/z) = Uz + UR\nz\n+ iQ log(z - 2i) - iQ log(R2/z + 2i).\nThe effect of U is just to scale and rotate the flow.

We have\nΦ(z) = z + R\nz\n+ iQ log(z - 2i) - iQ log(R2/z + 2i).\nSo, for z = x+ iy, the stream function is\nψ = Im(Φ) = (y - R\nr\ny + Q log(|z - 2i|) - Q log(|R2/z + 2i|)) .\nAgain we used Φ′ to draw some arrows for the velocity field and find stagnation points.\niQ\niQR2\nΦ′(z) = 1 - R2\n(2)\nz2 + z - 2i + z(R2 + 2iz).\nStagnation points are where Φ′(z) = 0.

As z goes to infinity Φ′(z) ≈ 1. This shows the vector\nfield is approximately uniform for large z.\nPart (b) is the same: The expression in Equation 2 for Φ′(z) is approximately 1 for large\nz.\nProblem 2. (15 points)\nConsider f(z) = z5 - 2z.\n(a) How many times does f wind the circle |z| = 3 around the origin? That is, let γ(θ)\nparametrize the circle. How many times does the curve f ∘ γ(θ) wind around the origin.\nSolution:\nThe figure on the left below show the plot of f ∘γ, where γ is the circle |z| = 3.\nLeft plot: parts (a) and (c).\nRight plot: part (b).\nWe will use the argument principle and Rouches theorem to show that the winding number\nof f ∘γ around 0 is Ind(f ∘γ, 0) = 5 .\nUsing the notation from the class notes, the argument principle says that Ind(f ∘ γ, 0) =\nZf,γ - Pf,γ. Since f is entire there are no poles and we have\nInd(f ∘γ, 0) = Zf,γ\nSo, to show the winding number is 5, it suffices to show that f has exactly 5 zeros inside γ.\nFor this, we split f into pieces: f = g+ z, where g(z) = z5 and h(z) = -2z. On |z| = 3 we\nhave\n|h| = 6 < 35 = |g|.\nSo Rouches theorem implies that Zg,γ = Zg+h,γ. Clearly Zg,γ = 5 This shows that f = g+h\nhas 5 zeros inside γ. QED.\n(b) How many times does f wind the circle |z| = 1 around the origin?\nSolution: The figure on the right above shows f ∘γ where γ is the unit circle. The style of\nargument is identical to part (a).\nLet f = g+ h, where g(z) = -2z and h = z5. On |z| = 1, |h| = 1 < 2 = |g|. It is clear that\ng has exactly one zero inside γ. So, Rouches theorem implies Zf,γ = Zg,γ = 1. That is, the\nwinding number is 1.\n\n18.04 Problem Set 9, Spring 2018 Solutions\n(c) How many times does f wind the circle |z| = 3 around the point z = -2?\nSolution: Let γ be the circle of radius 3 around the origin. Clearly, Ind(f ∘ γ, -2) =\nInd(-2 + f ∘γ, 0). Now we apply Rouches theorem to show that f(z) - 2 has 5 zeros inside\nγ. This will imply that Ind(f ∘γ, -2) = 5.\nLet g(z) = z5. |g| = 35 on γ. Also g has 5 zeros inside γ.\nLet h(z) = -2z - 2. |h| ≤ 8 on γ.\nSince |h| < |g| on γ, Rouches theorem says that f-2 = g+h and g both have 5 zeros inside\nγ.\nProblem 3. (10 points)\n(a) Show that f(z) = z3 + 9z + 30 has no roots in the disk |z| < 2.\nWe apply Rouches theorem: let g(z) = 9z + 30 and h(z) = z3. Both g and h are analytic\nand f = g+ h.\nOn the curve C∶ |z| = 2 we have |g| ≥ |12| and |h| = 8, i.e. |h| < |g|. Since |h| is strictly\nless than |g| on C, Rouches theorem implies that g and f = g+ h have the same number of\nzeros inside C. Since g(z) clearly has no zeros inside the circle, neither does f.\n(b) Show that f(z) = z6 + 4z2 - 1 has exactly two roots in the disk |z| < 1.\nLet g(z) = 4z2 - 1 and h(z) = z6. On the unit circle we have\n|h(z)| = 1 < 3 ≤ |g(z)|.\nSo, since g and h have no poles, Rouches theorem says g and f = g+ h have the same\nnumber of zeros inside the unit circle. The roots of g(z) are ±1/2, i.e. g has exactly two\nzeros in the disk, therefore, so does f.\nProblem 4. (7 points)\nSuppose f(z) is analytic on a region containing |z| ≤ 1. Suppose also that |f(z)| < 1 on\n|z| = 1. Show that f(z) - z has exactly one zero in the disk |z| < 1\nSolution: We know that g(z) = -z has exactly one zero in the unit disk. Since |f| < 1 = |g|\non the unit circle, we can apply Rouches theorem to show that\nQED.\n1 = Zg,|z|=1 = Zf+g,|z|=1 = Zf-z,|z=1\nProblem 5. (15 points)\nIn this problem we will consider linear systems with negative feedback, where the feedback\ngain is k. That is, if G(s) is the open loop system function then the closed loop system\nG(s)\nfunction is GCL(s) = 1 + kG(s).\ns + 1\n(a) Suppose a linear system has system function G(s) =\nLet the feedback\n(s - 1)(s - 2).\ngain k = 4. Is the closed loop system stable?

Since these are in the left half-plane, GCL is stable.\n(b) For the system in part (a) draw the Nyquist plot, that is draw the curve kG∘γ where the\ncurve γ is the y-axis. You can use any tool you want to do this. One suggestion is to use the\nfollowing applet: https://web.mit.edu/jorloff/www/jmoapplets/nyquist/nyquistCrit.html.\n(Use this version of the applet. I've modified the one we used in class to include feedback\ngain.)\nHow many times does this curve wind around -1? Explain how this is consistent with your\nanswer to part (a).\nSolution: The plot below shows the winding number of 4G ∘ γ around -1 is 2. This is\nconsistent with part (a) because:\n1. G(s) has two poles in the right half-plane.\n2. the Nyquist criterion for stability says that if GCL is stable then the winding number of\nthe Nyquist plot around -1 equals the number of poles in the right half-plane.\nProblem 6. (16 points)\nLet f(z) = (z + 1/z)/2. Use a package like Matlab or Mathematic to draw f ∘γ for the\nfollowing curves.\nMake sure that the axes both have the same scale, so that circles plot as circles and not\nellipses. In Matlab the command axis equal after you plot will do this.\n(a) The circle |z| = 3/2.\n(b) The circle |z + 1/2| = 3/2.\n(c) The circle |eiπ/4z + 1/2| = 3/2.\n(d) The unit circle |z| = 1.\n\n18.04 Problem Set 9, Spring 2018 Solutions\nanswers: We used the following Matlab (really Octave) code to do all the plots in this\nproblem. For each plot all we had to do is change the values of a and b.\n% Set the constants describing the circle\na = 1.5;\nb = -0.5;\n% Set theta from 0 to 2pi\nth = [0:.01:2*pi];\n% z is the circle being transformed\nz = a*e.^(1i*th) + b;\n% w is the transformed circle\nw = 0.5*(z+1./z);\n% Draw the plots\nhold off\n% This causes plot to erase the previous figure\n% Subplot can be used to put more than one graph in a figure.

So a = 3/2 and b = -1/2\n(c) This is similar to part (b).\n2 = 3\n2)\nv = eiπ/4z + 1\n2eiθ, so, z = e-iπ/4 (2\n3 eiθ- 1\nThat is, a = e-1i∗π/4 ∗ 1.5 and b = e-1i∗π/4 ∗ (-0.5)\nNotice how this looks like an airfoil. We could use a more complicated shaping functions to\nmap the circle to other shapes. This map would map a flow around the cylinder to a flow\naround the new shape. For example, this could be used to study flow around a wing.\n(d) Here a = 1 and b = 0. The result is a line segment on the real axis between -1 and 1.\nIt's easy to see why this happens: on the unit circle z = eiθ, so\nz+ 1/z = eiθ + e-iθ\n= cos(θ).\nThis is real and stays between -1 and 1.\n\n18.04 Problem Set 9, Spring 2018 Solutions\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Use the Laplace transform and partial fractions to solve the differential equation\n� ′′ + 8� ′ + 7� = �-2�\nwith initial conditions �(0) = 0, � ′(0) = 1.\nAns: Let �(�) ∶= (�(�); �). Then, taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the\ndifferential equation, we get\n(� ′′(�); �) + 8(� ′(�); �) + 7(�(�); �) = (�-2�; �)\ni.e.\n{�2� - ��(0) - � ′(0)} + 8{�� - �(0)} + 7� =\n� + 2\ni.e.\n�(�2 + 8� + 7) =\n+ 1.\n� + 2\n\nThus,\n� =\n=\n=\n+\n(� + 2)(� + 7)(� + 1)\n(� + 7)(� + 1)\n-1∕5\n1∕30\n1∕6\n-1∕6\n1∕6\n+\n+\n+\n+\n(� + 2)\n(� + 7)\n(� + 1)\n(� + 7)\n(� + 1)\n-1∕5\n1∕3\n-2∕15\n+\n+\n(� + 2)\n(� + 1)\n(� + 7).\nSo,\n1 �-� - 1 �-2� - 2 �-7�\n� =\n.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Is this consistent with Problem 1?\nAns: Yes, it is continuous. Yes, it is consistent, since Problem 1 is about differentiability\nand there are certainly continuous functions which are not differentiable.\n4.1. Express the following functions in the form � (�) = �(�, �) + ��(�, �): ��, �2, cos(�)\nand sin(�) (see also Problem 2)\n4.2.

Is this consistent with Problem 1?\nAns: See notes for these computations. The computation for cos(�) is also on the second\nproblem set. For 4.3, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are not satisfied, which is consistent\nwith what we saw in Problem 1.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.04 Complex Variables with Applications\nSpring 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
