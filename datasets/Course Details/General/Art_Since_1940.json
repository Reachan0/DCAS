Because of the burgeoning increase in art production, the course is necessarily selective. We will trace major developments and movements in art up to the present, primarily from the US; but we will also be looking at art from Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as art \"on the margins\" -- art that has been overlooked by the mainstream critical press, but may have a broad cultural base in its own community. We will ask what function art serves in its various cultures of origin, and why art has been such a lightning rod for political issues around the world.\n\nRequirements\n\nTo learn this subject, you will be expected to attend class meetings, do a good bit of outside reading and looking, view films during class, write two papers (one as part of a midterm), attend any field trips, participate in an in-class debate, and take a final exam. For help with writing, you are encouraged to take advantage of the\nwriting center\n. We understand there are different learning styles so please come to office hours or meet with the T.A. to plan a strategy that works for you.\n\nReadings\n\nThere is no one textbook for this course, but there are extensive readings from several books. Other recommended texts are useful for background or for further reading. All readings will be available on the course Web site or held on reserve in the MIT libraries. A complete list of readings by session can be found in the\nreadings\nsection.\n\nGrading\n\nGrades will be determined as follows:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nMidterm (including paper)\n\n20%\n\nFinal research paper\n\n30%\n\nFinal exam\n\n50%\n\nGood attendance and participation in class (particularly in the end of term debate) will bring extra credit to your final grade. You need to do work in each of the graded areas to pass this course, but we hope and anticipate that you'll be in touch with us if problems develop for you along the way.\n\nHonor Policy\n\nIt is expected that all written and exam work submitted for this class will be researched from established sources, but will be thought through and written on your own. We encourage you to get help with editing, but any and all sources you consult (beyond facts of record) need to be properly cited - even if those sources are Wikipedia, your roommate, or a peer reviewer! Work that is quoted without quotation marks, cited without footnotes, or otherwise \"borrowed\" without clear credit given where credit is due, will be considered plagiarism.",

The paper is due in class (or in my\noffice before class) as part of the midterm, which begins at\n9:30 sharp on Wednesday, October 20.\nThe essay should be typed or printed, as well as fiee of misspellings and typographical errors.\nYou are not expected to do extensive research beyond the readings assigned for class, but you\nshould definitely use class readings in your paper. You must properly footnote such materials in\naccordance with established academic standards. Use the Writing Center if you need help; I'm\nalso available during office hours. I recommend that you finish Friday so that you can use the\nweekend to study for the rest of the midterm!\nN.B.Late papers will not be accepted.\nChoose TWO works fkom the list below (they are all on view at the Harvard University\nArt Museums - see admissions details below), and conduct a close comparative analysis.\nExamine the visual elements of the sculpture or painting (pay attention to the way your\neye moves as you look, as well as what captures your attention - and use this to learn\nwhere the visual emphases are in the work). Describe these elements through an\nintegrated comparison (i.e., don't list each work's attributes separately, but synthesize the\ntwo). Once you have completed this analysis, discuss how each work relates to the\nAbstract Expressionist movement. I am less interested in flat judgments than in your\nreasoned arguments: of all the different stylistic variations (and rhetorical claims) we\nhave seen in Abstract Expressionism, which can be identified here? Are there any aspects\nof the works you are examining that do not fit the style as it was worked out in the late\n1940s and 1950s? Situate your arguments in an understanding of the artist's overall\nproduction as we have gone over it in class and learned through course readings.\nDavid Smith, Doorway on wheels, 1960.

      "content": "MIT 4.651 ART SINCE 1940\nProf. Caroline A. Jones\nResearch Papers\npdf November 16, 2010\nYour research paper should be at least 10 pages in length, and not more than 25; it should be\ncleanly typed with proper, humanities-style footnotes to all source material, plus a bibliography\nof all sources consulted. ANY USE OF SOURCES WITHOUT PROPER CITATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED\nPLAGIARISM. You should provide good labeled photocopies of whatever images or objects you\ndiscuss in detail; if reproductions aren't available, a sketch, line drawing, or your own\nphotograph is acceptable. Your thesis argument should be clearly stated in your first paragraph\nand reflected in your choice of a title for your essay; it should motivate your writing throughout\nand reach some resolution in your conclusion. I strongly suggest that you work from an outline\nto keep your essay on track. Read it over when you are done with your first draft -- did you\nreach the conclusion you thought you would? If not, go back and change the beginning to fit\nyour conclusion! Make your paper a coherent essay, not a collection of observations glued\ntogether with others' ideas. I will be happy to meet with you during office hours to discuss your\nchoice of a topic, to go over outlines or drafts, or talk about alternative approaches (see\nsuggested topics, below).\nPapers are due Lec #25, preferably in class. Unless they are given to my assistant before the\noffices close, or you have gotten prior authorization from me (or a signed medical excuse),\nyour paper will be considered late. Late papers will be given a numerical grade lowered by\n20%, and you may receive an Incomplete.\nIt should go without saying that essays should have artists' names correctly spelled, with all\ntitles and dates of works accurate and complete. Successful papers will have a clear thesis\nargument. Helpful guidebooks on writing essays include those by Sylvan Barnett, Kate\nTurabian, or the classic Elements of Style by Strunk and White. Extra credit will be given for\nusing the peer review system developed by Sylvan Barnett.\nSuggested Topics and Approaches\n1. Monographic: Go to the Museum of Fine Arts (your MIT ID gets you in for free), the\nHarvard Art Museums, the MIT List Visual Arts Center, the Rose Art Museum, or any\nother arts institution in the area and find a work on view at that dates from 1940 to the\npresent. Pick an artist you feel strongly about (positively or negatively), and find out\neverything you can about them before you write your paper. Use library books, journal\narticles, the internet, newspaper reviews, radio talkshows -- but cite your sources!\n. Analyze the work in detail\n. Situate this particular work in the artist's overall oeuvre\nthen pursue one or several of the following additional points, as a motivated argument:\n. Argue for the work's importance in the history of postwar art, or its meaning in its\noriginal context, and its changed meaning today\nContinued...\n\nMIT 4.651 ART SINCE 1940\nProf. Caroline A. Jones\nResearch Papers\npdf November 16, 2010\n. Demonstrate the work's links to earlier art (this should be more than speculative, and\nshould be anchored by research into the artist's sources)\n. Compare to earlier art of the same or similar genre, medium, style, subject, or\napproach, and analyze what has changed between the two periods\n. Explore the work's affinities (or lack thereof) with a movement with which it is usually\nassociated (i.e., postmodernism, Color Field, l'art brut, Tachisme, neo-Dada,\nassemblage, Minimalism, Pop, Gutai, Abstract Expressionism, etcetera). Here\nyou can argue with the \"experts,\" and present your own arguments for the work's\nsignificance.\n2. Thematic: Pick a theme that interests you, such as \"primitivism,\" \"politics and public art,\"\n\"graffiti,\" \"undergrounds,\" \"contemporary art and popular music,\" \"word and image,\"\n\"advertising and art marketing,\" \"engineering and art,\" race, masculinity, gender ... the\npossibilities are endless. Then, within this chosen theme:\n. Find an artist or an art movement that brings the theme into closer focus\n. Analyze the specifics of the historical period in which this artwork, artist, or art\nmovement operated to engage with your theme\nthen pursue one or both of the following additional points, as a motivated argument:\n. Argue why the artist's (or artists') chosen approach was successful - or unsuccessful\n- as an artistic strategy. Support your argument in either case with data about\nthe particular reception the art received, or the specific context in which it was\nproduced.\n. Argue for the works' relevance for today's culture.\n3. DIY: Define your own research project that combines thoughtful analysis of a work (or\nworks) of art with insights drawn from background reading on: the artist's intentions\n(insofar as these can ever be known), influences, personal biography, etc., and the work's\nsocial, critical, artistic, political or other pertinent contexts. You may make your final\npresentation in any medium (with my prior approval), but it must have some verbal\ncomponent that we agree upon in advance.\nNOTE: OPTION #3 REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE PROFESSOR.\n(this means well before the due date!!)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n4.651 Art Since 1940\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
