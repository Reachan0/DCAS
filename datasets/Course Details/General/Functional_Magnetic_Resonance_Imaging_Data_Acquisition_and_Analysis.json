The time rate of\nchange of Δ n is given by d(Δ n)/dt = (Δ n Δ n0)/T1, where T1 is the spinlattice\nrelaxation time and Δ n0 is the population difference at equilibrium.\na) Find the equation for the population difference at some time, t, after placing the\nsample in the magnet?\nb) How long does it take for the distribution to get to 90% of the Boltzmann\ndistribution if the T1 is 800 ms?\nPage 1 of 7\n\nWe want Δ n(t) and we have d(Δ n)/dt = (Δ n Δ n0)/T1.\nRearranging,\nd(Δ n) / (Δ n Δ n0) = dt/T1\nIntegrating both sides and recalling that integral(dx/x) = ln(x),\nln(Δ n Δ n0) = t/T1 + C, where C is a constant arising from indefinite integration\nlimits. Since C is constant, we can set t=0 and arrive at\nC = ln(Δ n(0) Δ n0)\nln(Δ n Δ n0) ln(Δ n(0) Δ n0) = t/T1\nRecall that ln(x) - ln(y) = ln(x/y)\nln[ (Δ n Δ n0) / (Δ n(0) Δ n0) ] = t/T1\nRaise both sides by e and recall that eln(x) = x\n(Δ n Δ n0) / (Δ n(0) Δ n0) = et/T1\nΔ n(0) is the spin level difference of the sample immediately after being placed in the\nmagnet, and cannot change instantaneously. Therefore, Δ n(0) = 0, the value it had\nbefore being placed in the magnet.\nΔ n(t) = Δ n0et/T1 + Δ n0 = Δ n0(1et/T1)\nb) We want Δ n(t) = 0.9Δ n0\n0.9Δ n0 = Δ n0(1et/T1)\n0.1 = et/T1\nTake the natural log of both sides and recall that ln(ex) = x\nt = T1*ln(0.1) = 1.84 sec\nProblem 3: Playing with T1 and T2 contrast\nPage 2 of 7\n\nUsing the table of tissue parameters below, we will investigate how the choice of pulse\nsequence parameters can change the contrast in the image. We will assume that the pulse\nsequence is the following: [π /2 - t1 π /2 - (t1+t2) π /2 - t1 - acquisition], a\nstimulated echo, and make use of the relationship: S = (ρ /2)( exp -(t1+t2)/T1 ) exp 2t1/T2,\nwhere S is the MR signal strength, ρ is the proton spin density, t1=TE/2 and t1+t2=TM.\nTissue\nT1\nT2\nρ\nGray matter\n1.2 s\n70 ms\n.98\nWhite matter\n800 ms\n45 ms\n.80\na) Plot the signal equation versus t1 for both white matter and gray matter assuming\nt2 = 50 ms.\nb) In another figure, plot the signal difference between white matter and gray matter\nas t2 is changed. Assume t1 = 25 ms.\nPage 3 of 7\n\nProblem 3: Calculation of Imaging Gradients\nAssuming a 10 cm field of view, a 10 ms phase encoding gradient, and 8 phase encoding\nsteps, what are the phase angles for each phase encoding step?\nθ y = γ\nΔ y Gy τ\nGy: FOVy = 1/γ Gy τ Gy = 1/γ FOVy τ\nθ y = γ\nΔ y τ (1/γ FOVy τ )\nθ y = Δ y / FOVy\nθ y = 1 cm / 10 cm = .1 rad\nProblem 4: Human safety in MRI\nThe goal of this problem is to make you aware of human safety issues when using fast\nbrain imaging sequences. Consider the following two pulse sequences: single shot\ngradientecho EPI (i.e., one 90° RF excitation pulse followed by a train of gradient\nrecalled echoes), and a single shot spinecho sequence (i.e., one 90° RF excitation pulse\nfollowed by a train of 180° RF refocusing pulses that form spinechoes).\na) Find an expression for the specific absorption rate (SAR) for both sequences.\nHint: make a simple model that considers the RF power deposited for a single RF\npulse and weight it by the duty cycle for the train of RF pulses. The duty cycle is\nthe amount of time the RF is turned on per TR, thus it contains information about\neach RF pulse duration, the number of slices acquired and the number of RF\npulses per TR. Does the weight of the patient matters?\nb) Based on the expression found in the previous point, compare the two sequences\nand discuss their limitations in terms of SAR. Which of the two sequences would\nbe likely to induce more peripheral nerve stimulation?\nPage 4 of 7\n\nWithout consideration of the orientation of the object to be imaged, the SAR will be\nproportional to: integral(B12(t)*dt) * [duty cycle] / weight(kg), where B1(t) is the\napplied RF pulse, the duty cycle is the the number of RF pulses per TR (this takes into\naccount the number of slices acquired per TR), and the limits of integration are 0 to TR.\nSince there is only 1 RF pulse per slice for the gradient echo sequence and several for the\nspinecho sequence, the spinecho sequence will distribute more energy into the subject\nper unit time given the same TR. For part b), the crucial factor is how fast the gradient\nfields change, i.e. fast gradient field switching is usually responsible for peripheral nerve\nstimulation. Therefore, the gradient echo sequence would be most likely to cause PNS.\nProblem 5: Considerations in pulse sequence acquisition parameters\nWhich parameter(s) would you keep the same to ensure that the degree and direction of\ndistortion between two different pulse sequences were the same? Why?\nAssuming an EPI sequence and imaging the same volume (or slice), the main factors that\naffect distortions (where distortions does not include blurry images from only sampling\nthe center of kspace) are bandwidth and echo spacing for the degree of the distortion,\nand the readout direction for the orientation of the distortion. For example, if we switch\nthe frequency encoding and phase encoding directions, the ghosts you mentioned will be\nalong the orthogonal dimension to what they were in the original sequence.\nPage 5 of 7\n\nProblem 6: More on Pulse Sequence Acquisition Parameters\nFor each of the two pulse sequences shown below:\na) Calculate the Total Acquisition Time\nb) Calculate the Voxel Size\nc) State whether it is a structural or functional scan (and how you know)\nd) State whether it is a 2D or 3D scan\nSEQUENCE ONE\nScanner SIEMENS MAGNETOM TrioTim\nRoutine\nSlab group: 1\nSEQUENCE TWO\nOrientation: Sagittal\nScanner SIEMENS MAGNETOM TrioTim\nPhase encode direction: A >> P\nRoutine\nReadout direction: R >> L\nSlice group 1\nSlices per slab: 160\nSlices: 30\nFoV read: 220 mm\nDist.

The total imaging time is the number\nof phase encodes multiplied by the TR\ntime. Since we have GRAPPA (parallel\nimaging technique) with acceleration\nfactor of 2, the scan time should be\nalmost halved. So we have 192*2.3s/2 =\n200.8 sec = 3.68min. Note that the\nGRAPPA algorithm requires acquiring\nseveral ACS (or phaseencoding) lines\nfor proper reconstruction, which add to\nthe scan time. The lab handout does not\nhave this info, so I can't say what would\nbe the precise imaging time, but in\nreality it should be a bit more than the\ncalculated 3.68min. Further, all the 160\nslices are acquired within the one TR,\nand this is possible since the TR is long\nand the TE is short.\nb). The FOV in x and y is 220mm, and\nthe matrix sizes are 256 and 192\nrespectively. Therefore, for x and y, we\nhave (220/256)x(220/192) =\n0.86x1.15mm2. Since the slice thickness\nis 1.2mm the overall voxel size is\n0.86x1.15x1.2mm3 = 1.1868mm3.\nc). This is a structural acquisition since\nthe number of measurements is 1.\nd). We are acquiring 160 slices, so this is\na 3D scan.\nScan 2\na). This is an EPI sequence used for\nfMRI acquisition. 30 slices with the\ngiven inplane resolution are acquired\nwithin the rather long TR period. The\ntotal acquisition time would depend on\nthe number of measurement, the TR time\nand the dummy scans. Therefore, we\nhave (142+3)*2 = 290sec = 4.833min.\nb). The slice thickness is 4mm and in\nplane matrix size is 64x64 over FOV is\n220mm2. Therefore the voxel size is\n4x(220/64)x(220/64)mm3 = 47.27mm3 =\n0.0473cc.\nc). This is a functional acquisition since\nthe number of measurements is 142 and\nthe TE and TR are long, and the\nresolution is low.\nd). This is a multislice 2D scan.\nPage 7 of 7"

From a physiological standpoint, why do you think this could\nhappen?\nfrom Hoge et. al., MRM, 1999\nAs flow increases become large, more and more deoxyhemoglobin is\nwashed out of the venous system, resulting in the concentration of dHb to\ndecrease substantially. As the limit is approached, very large flow increases\nare necessary for only incremental decreases in dHb concentration. At the\ntheoretical limit of extremely high flow rates, dHb is completely washed\nout and venous blood becomes fully oxygenated. At this limit, additional\nflow will not cause a change in the BOLD signal, since there is no dHb left\nto wash out!\n2.\nSE-BOLD theoretically can eliminate extravascular BOLD signal around\nlarger veins, thereby more specifically targeting late capillaries and early\nvenules. Why would this be advantageous? Given conventional scanners\navailable at most imaging centers, why do you think this is not routinely\ndone?\nSource: Hoge, R., et al.

Copyright (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.\n\nNeuronal activation is hypothesized to be spatially localized to capillary\nbeds, rather than draining veins. Imaging approaches that are exclusively\nsensitized to these areas are thus likely to be highly specific to neuronal\nactivation. SE-BOLD, however, is probably not commonly used on\nconventional scanners for at least two reasons: 1) SE-BOLD loses\nconsiderable CNR (and thus sensitivity), versus GRE-BOLD, and 2) at\nconventional field strengths (i.e. 1.5T and 3.0T) there is significant large\nvessel intravascular contribution to the BOLD signal. Therefore, the\nBOLD signal will still contain both large and small vessel contributions,\nand it will be impossible to separate the two. As such, small vessel sensitivity\nis lost.\n3.\nList two benefits and three drawbacks of going to higher fields for BOLD\nimaging? Explain.\nAdvantages: higher SNR, shorter T2/T2* of blood, leading to less\nintravascular effect; both these factors will make SE-BOLD more feasible.\nDrawbacks: greater susceptibility effects, increased distortion, more energy\ndeposition in subject (SAR) requiring long TRs, less homogeneous transmit\nand receive, shorter tissue T2/T2*. Other answers accepted.\n4.\nRight now there are pulse sequences that can acquire data at incredibly fast\nrates; with TRs on the order of a few milliseconds. Explain why this may not\nbe incredibly useful for doing BOLD fMRI?\nWith BOLD imaging, we are essentially limited by the speed of the\nhemodynamic response, which is on the order of seconds. Even if we\nwanted to accurately evaluate the shape of this response, few millisecond\nresolution is overkill.\n\n5. The figure on the left from\nSchwartz and colleagues\nsummarizes one of the first\nexperiments to use autoradiographic\ntechniques to map glucose\nmetabolism (1977). They subjected\nrats to an osmotic load which\nstimulated cell bodies in the PVN\nand SON (a). Interestingly, they\nsaw a large increase in metabolism\nin the posterior pituitary - the\nterminal end of PVN/SON axons\n(c), but did not see an increase in\nmetabolism near the SON/PVC\nnuclei (c). Comment on this\nfinding in light of Logothetis'\nobservation that fMRI signals are\nmore highly correlated to LFPs than\nAPs.\nThese data essentially support Logothetis' observations. If we assume that\nmetabolism roughly co-localizes with flow increase, then we would see a\nBOLD response in the posterior pituitary, where the axon potentials are\nsynpasing (i.e. modulating LFP), and not at the site of PVC/SON nuclei,\nwhere the action potentials are originating.\n6.\nIn lecture 3, we asserted that the BOLD response is roughly linear. In reality,\nthere are definitely some non-linear components to the signal. Speculate on\nwhere non-linearities could arise, considering the problem from a neuronal,\nmetabolic, and vascular point of view (i.e. one example for each; i.e. three\ntotal).\nNeuronal: adaptation would certainly affect linearity.\nThree photos removed due to copyright restrictions.\nFigure 1a, b, and c in Schwartz, W. J., et al. \"Metabolic Mapping\nof Functional Activity in the Hypothalamo-Neurohypophysial\nSystem of the Rat.\" Science New Series 205, no. 4407 (August 17,\n1979): 723-725.\n\nMetabolic: Some have suggested that CMRO2 and CBF are initially\nuncoupled, due to immediate energy demands being met by anaerobic\nrespiration. Under this model, responses to short stimuli (which favor\nanaerobic respiration) may not scale with stimuli duration -- as stimulus\ntimes increase, metabolism will shift to aerobic respiration.\nVascular: As seen in question 1, there clearly is a non-linear relationship\nbetween BOLD and CBF.\n7.\nCBF increases in response to neural activation. Most evidence suggests that\nthis occurs by increasing capillary blood velocity, not by capillary recruitment.\nImagine for a second, that this is actually wrong; i.e. there is significant\ncapillary recruitment during neuronal activation. Does this alter our view of\nthe oxygen limitation model as an explanation of why CBF increases\nsignificantly more than CMRO2 during activation?\nThis would cast doubts on the model, which assumes that oxygen extraction\ndecreases since capillary transit time decreases upon increased CBF. If\nCBF increased by recruitment, instead of by velocity increase, capillary\ntransit time should remain the same, and extraction should not decrease.\n8.\n(Extra Credit) As we saw in Lecture 4, water diffusing around small vessels\nexperience a range of fields, such that phase offsets acquired in the first half of\nthe experiment are different from those acquired in the second half. This\nleads to an inability to completely refocus the signal during a spin echo\nexperiment, resulting in a small but measurable phase change between\nactivated and baseline states (circled). This ∆phase alters the T2/R2 and\nproduces a modest change in the SE-BOLD signal (thick red double arrow).\nWe also discussed why this effect is reduced around large vessels (thin red\ndouble arrow): the field size is large compared to the diffusion size; water\nmolecules feel a constant field, leading to a linear phase accrual, which can be\nreversed with a spin echo.\nWe did not discuss, however, the fact that the effect peaks around vessels with\nradius of ~7 um, and decreases with smaller vessels. At a vessel radius of 1\num (for example), the spin echo sequence does not cause much of T2/R2\nchange (thick blue arrows). Explain why this is the case.\n\nIf diffusion is considerably larger than the local field perturbation caused\nby the vessel, each water molecule will diffuse past many vessels and thus\nsample the full range of field distortions. If the diffusing spins feel all the\nvariations, the net phase acquired by each is roughly the same and there is\nvery little phase dispersion. Thus, at the echo time, there will be\nessentially zero phase accrual in both the activated and baseline states,\nand ∆phase is zero! Note that this means there will be little signal change\nin BOTH the GRE an SE BOLD experiment around these very small\nvessels!"

Equivalently, it has a zero determinant. Also equivalently,\nat least one column of the matrix is an exact linear combination of the other columns.]\nb) What does it mean for a design matrix to be illconditioned?\n[The determinant is nearly zero; at least one column is nearly a linear combination of the other\ncolumns.]\nc) What are the implications of a) and b) above on:\ni) the ability of the model to fit the data?\n[None. Poorly conditioned design matrices impact the interpretation of the coefficients of\nthe model; the model fit is unaffected.]\nii) the coefficient estimates and their standard errors?\n[The coefficients are not uniquely determined for the situation where the design matrix is\nsingular, and hence they have infinite standard errors. For the poorlyconditioned situation,\nthe large uncertainty in the coefficients will result in large standard errors for at least some of\nthe coefficients.]\n3. What is the difference between a fixedeffects and a randomeffects\nmodel?\n[In a fixed effects model, the overall mean activation for each subject is a constant, which is\nestimated from the data. So each subject has a coefficient associated with it in the GLM\nwhich is that subject's mean. In a random effects model, the subjects are modeled as a\nrandom sample of subjects from a population. Hence, it is usually not meaningful to estimate\nthe 'mean' activation for a subject, since this is a realization of a random variable, not an\nunknown constant. Consequently, the random effect for subject is assumed to be a Gaussian\nrandom variable with mean zero, and it is characterized by it's variance: the betweensubject\nvariance.\nFixed effects models are appropriate when one does not wish to generalize beyond the\nsubjects at hand, or when it is perhaps hopeless to consider doing so because there are too\nfew subjects to reasonably expect to be able to estimate betweensubject variability.\nRandom effects models yield results that are likely to be valid for future subjects sampled from\nthe same population. Hence, random effects models are usually preferred in fMRI analysis.]\n\nCan one have a model that includes both types of effects?\n[yes]\n4. Is there an optimal level of spatial smoothing. If not, why? If so, what is it?\n[ Yes. It should be the same size as the activation blobs you are looking for. ]\n[No. There is no one level of smoothing that is optimal as the optimal size depends on the\nsize of the activation blobs, which will differ across space, contrast, and subject]\n[Yes. The minimum amount necessary in order for Gaussian random field theory to be valid].\n5. Sketch out a typical hemodynamic response function (HRF), give approximate values for\nthe onset delay, delay to peak, and equilibration time.\n[ ]\n7. You are performing an experiment in which you are manipulating a psychological variable\n(eg, working memory load) at levels of 1, 3, and 5 (ie, you are presenting stimuli that represent\nlevels 1, 3, and 5). You wish to test for a linear effect of the variable. There are two possible\nways: (Method 1) you can model the level directly in the design matrix, or (Method 2) you can\nmodel each level separately and test for a linear effect with a contrast. For the purposes of\nthis exercise assume a shape to the hemodynamic response and do not worry about\nnuisance variables like offset and drift.\na) Describe in words how you would implement Method 1. Include a contrast matrix to test\nfor the slope.\n[There would be two regressors in the design matrix. One regressor would be the regressor\ncreated from the design when all levels were pooled into one condition. The other would be\nthe same except that each individual presentation is scaled by its level. The first regressor\ncodes for an offset and the second codes for the slope of the effect. The contrast would be [0\n1].]\nb) In Method 2, you would have a regressor for each level. Describe how you would\ncreate a contrast matrix to test for a nonzero slope.\n[This is set up like another GLM type of problem. You have an independent variable (the\nlevels) and you have observations/dependent variables (the regression coefficients (betas),\nand you are going to model their relationship by a slope and offset, and then test the slope.\n\n8. a) What is a null hypothesis?\n[The null hypothesis is the situation which obtains if the effect being tested is not true. It\nusually is of the form of something being equal to zero, for example 'the mean difference in\nactivation between stimulus blocks and fixation blocks is zero'. The logic of statistical\nhypothesis testing is to tentatively assume that the null is true, to assess the likelihood that\nthis is the case via a test statistic, and then to (hopefully) reject the null in favor of the\nalternative if this likelihood is sufficiently small. The null hypothesis can either be rejected or\nnot rejected; it can never be accepted.]\nb) What is an alternative hypothesis?\n[The alternative hypothesis is the situation which one assumes will obtain if the null is not\ntrue. Situations not included in either the null or the alternative are assumed apriori to be\n*impossible*.]\nc) Give an example of how one can have two different pvalues for the same null hypothesis\ndepending on the alternative hypothesis which is used (hint: these two pvalues for a simple\nexample of this situation will have ratio 1/2).\n[If one tests the null hypothesis that a coefficient is zero against the alternative that it is\npositive, then one will obtain some pvalue, say \"p\". If one performs the same test with the\nsame data but tests against the alternative that the coefficient is *nonzero*, then one will\nobtain the pvalue \"2p\". The first is called a onetailed test, the latter a twotailed test.]\nd) Can both the null and the alternative hypothesis be true for a valid hypothesis test?\n[No.]\nSet up the forward model:\nBeta = D*q, where Beta are the HRF amplitude estimates from the 1st level analysis (ie, Beta\n= [beta1 beta2 beta3]'), D is the linear relationship:\nD\n= 1\nFirst column codes offset, 2nd column codes slope, which are the things we want to estimate\n(ie, q = [offset slope]'). Solve for q = inv(D'*D)*D'*beta. We are only interested in the slope = [0\n1]*q = [0 1]* inv(D'*D)*D'*beta. The contrast matrix is the thing we multiply by beta, so C = [0\n1]* inv(D'*D)*D']\n\n9. What is the problem of multiple comparisons? Choose one solution to explain.\n[Consider the situation where a single hypothesis is tested at the 0.05 significance level. This\nmeans that if one were to imagine repeating the experiment many times, and if this null\nhypothesis happened to be true, then one would make a mistake by rejecting this hypothesis\nonly 5% of the time, due to chance. Now if one imagines testing 20 such hypotheses at the\nsame time, and if these hypotheses, for simplicity, happen to be independent, then one would\nmake a mistake on average once for each replication of the experiment, not 1 in 20 as before.\nAn example is hypothesis tests at each of thousands of voxels.]\n10. a) Why is it desirable to specify regions of interest in an fMRI experiment before looking at\nthe data, to the full extent that this is possible?\n[Selecting regions apriori reduces the problem of multiple comparisons and thus can\ngreatly increase the power of hypothesis tests and enhance the likely validity of conclusions.\nSelecting regions of interest aposteriori means that the\nsame data that are used to\nformulate hypotheses are being used to test the hypotheses.]\nb) If a region that was not of interest apriori is found to have a statistically significant pvalue\nonce the data are analyzed, what can one say about the interpretation of this pvalue?\n[The pvalue overstates the statistical significance of the result, by an unknown amount.\nThe extent to which the pvalue overstates the significance depends on to what extent\nhypotheses are selected aposterior (i.e., how much \"fishing\" is being done.).\nc) What can be done to improve the situation in b) above?\n[Conduct a followup study, for which hypotheses formulated aposteriori in the first (pilot)\nstudy will be specified apriori. Or else, crossvalidate by setting using some subjects (chosen\nat random) for hypothesisgeneration, and setting aside the others for validation. In any case,\nthe fact that the regions were not of apriori interest needs to be made clear in any report of\nthe results.]"

There are two possible ways: (Method 1) you can\nmodel the level directly in the design matrix, or (Method 2) you can model each\nlevel separately and test for a linear effect with a contrast. For the purposes of\nthis exercise assume a shape to the hemodynamic response and do not worry\nabout nuisance variables like offset and drift.\n\na) Describe in words how you would implement Method 1. Include a contrast\nmatrix to test for the slope.\n\nb) In Method 2, you would have a regressor for each level. Describe how you\nwould create a contrast matrix to test for a non-zero slope.\n\n8. a) What is a null hypothesis?\n\nb) What is an alternative hypothesis?\n\nc) Give an example of how one can have two different p-values for the same null\nhypothesis depending on the alternative hypothesis which is used (hint: these\ntwo p-values for a simple example of this situation will have ratio 1/2).\n\nd) Can both the null and the alternative hypothesis be true for a valid hypothesis\ntest?\n\n9. What is the problem of multiple comparisons? Choose one solution to explain.\n\n10. a) Why is it desirable to specify regions of interest in an fMRI experiment\nbefore looking at the data, to the full extent that this is possible?\n\nb) If a region that was not of interest a-priori is found to have a statistically\nsignificant p-value once the data are analyzed, what can one say about the\ninterpretation of this p-value?\n\nc) What can be done to improve the situation in b) above?\n\n11.

The trouble is that they know nothing about\nfMRI. Since you have just completed HST.583, your friend assumes you are an expert\non this topic and has come to you for advice. Most importantly, there is a rich donor who\nhas given unrestricted funds to pay for the scans, subject remuneration and generous\nconsulting fees to you, the expert, for providing the following information.

Here are examples of good ones.\n-Since the differences between rest with eyes open and closed is still\ncontroversial, a paradigm that ensures that during the baseline condition all subjects\nmaintain the same state (eyes open and fixated on center of screen or closed) will\ndecrease between subject variance and perhaps even improve within subject\nsignificance of results.\n-Any method to ensure that during \"baseline\" subjects are indeed resting quietly\nwith eyes closed or open and not doing another \"off paradigm\" task (recalling list of\nerrands to run after experiment is over)- physiological monitoring, low level task- fixate\ncross hair, etc. will give more consistent results within and across subject.]\nProblem 2:\nA physics post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Adelsteinsson's lab shows you a generalized pulse\nsequence for a common imaging technique used boost T1 contrast.

(3 points)\n\nDraw at zero crossing. Mz will be zero here, so when you excite with your 90 for\nimaging, no signal will be knocked down into the transverse plane (Mxy) and no signal\nwill be detected by the receiver coils.\n\nc) Why would it be useful to eliminate white matter signal when performing functional\nimaging analyses? (1 point)\nFor example if you want to segment out gray matter exclusively - this gives you excellent\nwhite matter/gray matter contrast (the best possible actually, since white matter is now\ndark!).\n\nd) The T1 of white matter is 832 ms. Compute the TI needed to null white matter signal.\n(Hint: Modify the longitudinal (T1) magnetization equation to accommodate double the\ndynamic range).

Advantages of assuming a shape: increased statistical efficiency and a higher\nnumber of DOFs.]\n\nProblem 4:\n\nOne controversial claim for BOLD fMRI is that the positive change in signal amplitude is\npreceded by a smaller decrease in signal. This postulated decrease has been termed\nthe \"initial dip\" or \"early dip\":\n) Suggest a possible physiological mechanism for the initial dip. (5 points)\n) If the initial dip does exist, why could it be useful for functional imaging? (5 points)\n) Why do you think it has been difficult to observe with fMRI? (5 points)\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\n[Answer:\nial dip may represent the initial increase in CMRO2 before blood flow\na) The init\nincreases to deliver more oxygen (see Malonek and Grinvald, Menon). As a result, the\nBOLD signal will initially go down, since there is transiently more deoxyhemoglobin in\nthe local blood, since oxygen is being removed and metabolized by the neuron. As CBF\nstarts to increase, delivery of oxygenated blood will flush out the dHb, leading to the\nmain positive response.\n\nAlso acceptable: the Buxton et. al. balloon model can also explain the initial dip, based\non a non-linear flow out/ volume relationship. That is, if the curve initially has a shallow\nslope, so that with a sharp increase of Fin the first effect is a rapid filling of the balloon\n(because Fout is slow to increase), then the dHb content initially would increase due to\nthe increased venous volume. This would also result in an initial dip.\n\nb) Because CMRO2 should be more spatially specific to neural activity (since an increase\nin CMRO2 is closely associated with firing neurons) the initial dip may be a more\nspatially accurate measure of activation. Some believe that CBF may not be regulated\nwith as fine a spatial control as CMRO2 (recall \"watering garden for sake of thirsty\nflower\").\nSource: Duong et al. MRM 44 (2000): 231-242.\nCourtesy of Wiley-Liss, Inc., a subsidiary of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nUsed with permission.\n\nc) Much smaller signal, thus harder to resolve given the limits imposed by the poor\ncontrast to noise of fMRI BOLD signals.]\nroblem 5:\nist three possible ways CBF may be regulated in the brain; give a brief description of\nts)\n\nP\nL\neach.

Capillary flow in\nthe brain is regulated by\n1- modulation of arteriolar diameter by vasoactive substances (NO, CO2, K+, adenosine)\nthat bind to vascular smooth muscle receptors (glia, neurons, ?)\n2- secretion of vasoactive substances (Adenosine, NO, Prostaglandins, H+, K+) by\nneurons that are the byproducts of energy metabolism into surrounding neuropil\n3- direct neural innervation of arterioles (NO, VIP, DA, Substance P, NA, GABA, 5-HT,\nACh)\n4- indirect control by substances (K+, Adenosine, CO2) released via astrocyte endfeet\n5- Pericyte constriction at capillary level\nroblem 6:\n) When registering the fMRI data from one of your subjects to his/her own structural\nlected in the same scan session, what are the sources of noise (variance)?\ne\nne method for inter-subject registration of the fMRI data from the subjects\none of your experiments so that you can perform a group analysis.

Either of these methods can use\n\nmany different warping algorithms (e.g. affine, spline, cortical surface). Sources of noise\ninclude inter-subject variability in anatomy, inconsistency in image acquisition\nparameters (e.g. cross site or after upgrade), poor head positioning in scanner with large\ndifferences in distortions]\n\nProblem 7:\nOne of your best friends aspires to do an fMRI experiment to test their hypothesis about\nshifts attention from doing a single task to doing two simultaneous tasks.\n\nbeyond what you\narned in the course is required; just apply your own best logical effort and common\nand\nhow the brain\nThe hypothesis is that there is only a \"fixed\" amount of attentional ability in the brain and\nthat when shifting from one to two tasks the ability will be \"divided\" and hence less will\nbe available for either one of the two tasks.

(5 points)\n\nAll answers must include the following: fMRI data is noisy, signals are small and\nsubjects highly variable. With too small of a sample size, you may miss a real finding\ncompletely if the activations in regions are near threshold for detection or if have much\ninter-subject variability in localization. This is especially important for the smaller brain\nregions. A minimal sample size to draw meaningful conclusions is typically 12-16\n(anecdotally, for many fMRI studies). The actual required sample size, however,\nrequired depends on several factors; specifically the expected effect size and the desired\npower.\n\niii. A description of the fMRI paradigm that includes exactly what the subjects will be\noing and when and how. (5 points)\nd\n\nAn example of a correct response is:\nFirst experiments typically begin with a block design to maximize power to detect\nregional activation. She is proposing to spend 6 10 minute long scans doing an event\nrelated paradigm. A less risky proposal would be to invest in a few block design trials to\nidentify the voxels of interest and then use the event related paradigm to look at the\nhemodynamic response times of the components of the network. Also, she made no\nmention of parametrically varying the motor task to allow a more robust detection of\nmovement correlated activation. Such variations could include the dimension of time\n(duration of movement), complexity, numbers of fingers used.\n\nA minimum of two event types must be specified; complex finger movement and imagined\nfinger movement and the duration of each event specified. Adequate time must be given\nfor rest (control condition). Each trial should be 1-5 sec long. We need plenty of trials to\nhave statistical power, so given 10 minutes scan could do about 100 trials per scan.\nEither spaced events spaced about 16 sec or rapid presentation with 5-10sec with jitter.\nThe number of trials needs to be provided along with information about whether the\nevents are being timed for a block, spaced single trial or rapid event related analysis.\n\nTo be able to average data across all scans, need to have stable performance of the task\nduring real movement so must practice prior to scans until achieve plateau performance.\nThis also indicates need to collect behavioral data to verify performance accuracy, speed\netc. Otherwise, learning/memory effects may confound results. This training will also\nhelp to equilibrate the attention level of subjects and will help equilibrate the imagery\ncomponent across subjects.\n\nKeeping still for 10 minutes is difficult for some subjects; a larger number of shorter\nscans (~5minutes) may yield better quality data with less motion artifact.\neriment.

Please immediately\nconfirm you have all 5 pages! This is a closed book/ closed notes exam. You have one\nhour.\n\nRead the whole exam first. Write legibly. Describe what you are thinking. Even if the\nfinal answer is wrong, you will be given credit for your reasoning and approach to the\nproblem. Be efficient, assess what you can answer right away; divide your time so that\nyou can cover all the problems, allocating less time to the easiest parts. Don't spend too\nmuch time on a single question. Try not to leave questions blank; we cannot give\npartial credit without something written down.\n\nProblem 1 (25 points):\nSpatial attention has been hypothesized to be an emergent function of a \"Tri-nodal\nCortical Network\".\n\na) Name each of the three cortical regions that comprise the \"Tri-nodal Cortical Network\"\nfor spatial attention (5 points)\n\nFrontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex and cingulate gyrus\n\nb) Design your own or describe a published experimental paradigm to probe the\nattention network. Your answer must include a clearly stated hypothesis (5 points), a\nbriefly, but accurately described paradigm (5 points), and predicted or reported outcome\n(5 points).\n\nSeveral described in textbook and in Brad Dickerson's lecture notes; levels of arousal,\nvisual or spatial directed attention, domain or modality specific attentional modulation\n\nc) Choose an appropriate acquisition sequence for collecting this scan noting type of\nsequence, and relevant parameters (5 points)\n\nFor example:\nGradient echo EPI at 3T, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, 20 slices, 5 mm thickness, 1 mm\ngap, FOV = 220 mm, matrix size = 64x64, BW = 2520 Hz/pixel, etc.\n\nPage 1 of 6\nHST.583: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Data Acquisition and Analysis, Fall 2008\nHarvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology\nCourse Director: Dr. Randy Gollub.\n\nProblem 2 (15 Points):\nStandard functional imaging at the Martinos Center uses an echo planar (EPI) imaging\nparadigm (30 slices, 4 mm slice thickness, TE = 30 ms, TR = 2000 ms, matrix size =\n64x64).\n\na) What is the phenomenon that causes EPI distortions called? (5 points)\n\nMagnetic susceptibility, which leads to Bo-field inhomogeniety\n\nb) What regions of the brain are most susceptible to these distortions. Explain. (5 points)\n\norbitofrontal, medial-temporal- areas that are at air tissue interfaces.\n\nc) What relaxation parameter allows the generation of contrast through the BOLD effect?\n(5 points)\n\nT2*; the paramagnetic nature of deoxyhemoglobin will slightly alter the local magnetic\nfield, leading to spin dephasing. This is a concentration-dependent phenomenon; as the\namount of dHb changes, so will the local T2*. T2 is also acceptable; SE-BOLD also\nproduces functional contrast that is more sensitive to changes around smaller vessels\n(why?).\n\nProblem 3 (20 points):\nAfter a short fMRI scan during which your subject performed a carbon dioxide inhalation\ntask (block design paradigm in which she alternates between breathing room air and\nbreathing room air enriched with 10% carbon dioxide), she takes a coffee break. The\ncaffeine in her coffee is a known vasoconstrictor (i.e. decreases the radius of arterioles).\n\na) Will caffeine cause a global increase or decrease in baseline cerebral blood flow\n(CBF)? Explain. (5 points)\n\nCBF is proportional to r4, so a vasoconstriction will decrease blood flow.\nThe major way blood flow is regulated in the brain is by vasoconstriction/ dilation of\narterioles perfusing tissue and capillary beds. A change in arteriolar diameter results in\na change in vascular resistance, leading to a change in flow. Vasodilation decreases\nvascular resistance, resulting in an increase in blood flow. Vasoconstriction increases\nvascular resistance, resulting in a decrease in blood flow.\n\nb) Carbon dioxide inhalation is thought to (increase/ decrease/ not affect) oxygen\nmetabolism (CMRO2). Explain. (5 points)\n\nCarbon dioxide inhalation should not alter CMRO2. Carbon dioxide is a potent\nvasodilator and will cause arteriolar smooth muscle to relax, thereby increasing CBF;\nhowever, it should not alter neuronal activity in an appreciable way. CMRO2 is thus not\nexpected to change. This is a key assumption made in Hoge and Davis' seminal work,\nand is one that is still made in state-of the-art studies. The hemoneural hypothesis, if\ncorrect, may challenge this idea.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nHappily caffeinated, she returns to the magnet and you resume scanning using the exact\nsame carbon dioxide inhalation task. Assume that the absolute change in CBF during\ncarbon dioxide inhalation is the same as in the original scan (i.e. before coffee).\n\nc) Do you expect the BOLD percentage change during carbon dioxide inhalation to\n(increase/ decrease/ stay the same), compared to the original scan (i.e. before coffee)?\n(10 points)\n\nTo help you answer this problem, consider the BOLD/flow relationship derived by Hoge\nand Davis; feel free to plot this curve if it helps you answer the problem.\n\nSince CO2 is a potent vasodilator ΔCBF should be positive during CO2 inhalation\nblocks. We are also told that ΔCBF will stay the same before and after caffeine\ningestion. Since CBFo decreases due to caffeine, and ΔCBF is positive and stays the\nsame, the percentage change (ΔCBF/ CBFo) increases.\n\nThe flow-BOLD relationship is drawn below. A increase in (ΔCBF/ CBFo) moves us to\nthe right and up on the curve. Therefore, the percentage BOLD response\n(ΔBOLD/BOLDo) also increases.\n\nPage 3 of 6\nCourtesy of Wiley-Liss, Inc., a subsidiary of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nUsed with permission. Copyright (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.\n\nProblem 4 (10 points):\nThe post stimulus undershoot (PSU) is a consistent feature of the BOLD hemodynamic\nresponse. Provide a possible explanation for the PSU that considers dynamic changes\nin physiology during activation. Feel free to use hand drawn diagrams and/or graphs.\n\nOne possible explanation: after neural activity ceases, blood flow returns to baseline\nfaster than the venous vasculature can shrink back to its original size (venous vessels\nare compliant and increase in volume in response to increased pressure and flow).\nSince flow returns to baseline more quickly than blood volume, there ends up being a\ngreater amount of deoxyhemoglobin present transiently. Once volume returns to\nbaseline, the BOLD signal does as well (as seen below).\n\nProblem 5 (5 points):\nWhat are two different types of experimental manipulation used in fMRI tasks for relating\nspecific mental processes to specific brain regions? For each, give an example from\nsomething presented in class or a published study.\n\nAnswer:\nI was initially looking for:\n1) Hold the stimulus constant and vary the task:\nFor the self reference task, the stimulus (trait adjectives) is held constant and the task\nvaries between self reference and semantic questions.\n\n2) Hold the task constant and vary the stimulus\nFor the SIRP task, the task (maintain information in WM) is constant and the\nstimulus varies (parametric modulation of working memory LOAD)\n\nI also accepted (because the wording of the question is sufficiently vague that nearly all\nof you interpreted it this way!):\n1) Block design\nPage 4 of 6\n\n2) Event related\n\nProblem 6 (15 points):\nIt is well known that fMRI data is very noisy. Considerable effort is being made on\nmultiple fronts to improve activation detection sensitivity (improve signal to noise). For\neach of the domains listed describe one way to improve sensitivity to fMRI signal\nchanges and explain why it would work.\n\na) Image acquisition\n\nb) experimental design\n\nc) image analysis (post-processing)\n\nAnswer:\na) Higher field strengths, Multi-channel imaging coils, Restrict head motion, Monitor\nrespiratory and cardiac signal to use as regressors, Gate to cardiac signal, Choose\nbetter TE to optimize BOLD contrast, averaging, larger voxel size\n\nb) More trials, Longer blocks, Design experiments s.t. design vectors are orthogonal to\ndrift vectors, Create tasks that better isolates cognitive area of interest, fast event related\nwith more trials\n\nc) Smooth data (optimize smoothing kernel), Temporally filter data to remove\nautocorrelation, Use FIR analysis if HRF is not well known, Use model-free analysis if\nthere is no prior info about expected signals, ROI based analysis\n\nProblem 7 (10 points):\nDiffusion Weighted Imaging is used to investigate white matter integrity and pathology\nassociated with normal aging and neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis that\nare known to disrupt axonal function and/or myelination.\n\na) What would you expect to observe about FA values in areas of disruption along a\nwhite matter tract, such as the cortico-spinal tract?

The idea is to explain how to execute ba\nsic tasks and also expose some useful functionality that may not be obvi\nous to the user. Weʼve tried to make the software as open and intuitive as\npossible, but there is no substitute for actually taking a guided tour of a\nprogram by following a tutorial. Iʼve made fairly extensive use of footnotes\nto keep the main text clear while providing details where it might be help\nful.\nThe dataset provided is a simple visual activation experiment performed\non a human subject in a 3 Tesla whole body scanner. The scans of inter\nest include a whole brain structural scan and a functional MRI image se\nries. The exercise starts with raw DICOM files transferred directly from the\nscanner and finishes with the export of activation maps into a word proc\nessor. The data analysis topics include spatial normalization but stop just\nbefore group analysis. Group analysis will be the topic of a second\n(shorter) tutorial.\nThe exercises in this tutorial take you through a fully interactive analysis\nsession, but the entire analysis performed in the exercise could also be\nscripted (this will be the topic of a later tutorial).\nIf you donʼt already have the NeuroLens software it can be downloaded at\nhttp://www.neurolens.org/Download/. This tutorial document is distributed\nin a zip archive which contains all data and other files required to do the\nexercises. You can always download the latest version of this tutorial\n(data and instructions) at http://www.neurolens.org/Tutorials/Tutorial1.zip\nWe would like to thank the Office of National Drug Control Policy for fund\ning this work as part of the MGH Phenotype-Genotype Project on Addic\ntions and Mood Disorders.\n\nv1.5.0\nExercise 1: Loading the DICOM files\nNeuroLens makes it easy to work with output directly from the MRI scan\nner. You can read DICOM files1 directly into NeuroLens without any pre\nparatory format conversion and run any viewing or processing operation.\nTypically you will still want to export them to another format such as MINC\nas a more convenient working format, and this is what we will do in this\nexercise.\nMINC is supported as a preferred working format because a single file can con\ntain an entire acquisition series. It typically takes many DICOM files to represent\nthe same information. MINC also provides support for all the descriptive meta\ndata used by NeuroLens. In the future we will also support NIfTI export.\nTo get started, follow the steps listed below:\nLaunch NeuroLens\nYou launch NeuroLens by double-clicking its icon, which is usually in the\nApplications Folder.\nOpen the files\nYou will load all of the DICOM files for the tutorial experiment. These can\nbe found in the DICOM Folder of the folder Tutorial1 that was unzipped\nwhen you downloaded this tutorial (normally downloaded to your Desk\ntop).\nYou can open a folder of DICOM files by dragging the folder onto the Neu\nroLens icon in the Finder or Dock. You can also select File > Open in\nNeuroLens and select the folder that contains all of the DICOM files.\nView the session info\nAfter all the files are read, a window will open showing the list of \"series\"\ncontained in the folder2. This provides a much more useful summary of\nthe information than the folder full of DICOM files. An example of this win\n1 DICOM is the image data standard used by virtually all vendors of clinical medical imag\ning systems. More than a file format, it is a standard for network communications be\ntween imaging systems in a hospital PACS environment. As currently implemented by\nmost manufacturers, DICOM has a few disadvantages as a working file format for scien\ntific users - in particular the number of files used to represent a single acquisition can be\nvery large (hundreds of files).\n2 The term \"series\" is used to denote the set of DICOM files that comprise a single scan.\nThe files in a series usually represent different slices of a volume, and may include repeti\ntions of the volume over time.\n\nv1.5.0\ndow is shown in the figure labeled \"DICOM Folder Browser\". On the left\nside of the window (blue box) is a list of the series that were found in the\nfolder. On the right side of the window (red box) is a list of acquisition pa\nrameters for the selected series. At the bottom of the window is a text field\ndisplaying the disk location where files will be saved in MINC format if the\n\"Convert\" button is clicked.\nAcquisition Info\nSeries List\nDICOM Folder Browser\nFor this tutorial, only the series number 5 and 9 of a longer scanning ses\nsion have been included in the DICOM folder (for faster download). The\nseries number reflects the order of the scan in the session. Series 5 is a\nT1-weighted structural scan (the protocol name is Flat Sag 3D revro\nscaled3) and series 9 is a functional MRI time series (protocol ge_func\ntionals_644).\nTry loading a series by double-clicking its entry in the series list, or by se\nlecting it and clicking the \"Load\" button. Each dataset should open in a\nnew window displaying slices along the three anatomic planes and a plot\nof the MRI signal as a function of time for series 9.\n3 Sagittal 3D scan intended for cortical reconstruction and flattening using a reverse\nreadout and improved scale factor.\n4 Gradient-echo functional scan with a 64x64 image matrix.\n\nv1.5.0\nWhile NeuroLens can load DICOM files very quickly, it will generally be\nmore convenient to export the scans to a format in which there are fewer\nfiles. In preparation for the next Section, specify a location on your disk\nwhere you can create files (e.g. your Desktop) by clicking the \"Choose...\"\nbutton. Then select both series in the list5 and click the \"Convert\" button to\nexport these series to MINC format at the specified location. A new folder\nwill be created at the location you chose and each series will be written to\na single file inside it.\nExercise 2: Viewing MRI scans\nFinding the data\nNow locate the newly exported MINC files in the folder you selected in the\nprevious session. This folder will be named \"demo1-trio-20501-20040113\n083038\" based on descriptive information read from the DICOM files6.\nNote also that NeuroLens creates a preview icon that shows the contents\nof the file:\nSeries 9\nSeries 5\nFolder name\n5 ⌘-A selects all series, or you can ⌘-click to select multiple series one by one.\n6 The hypen-separated fields in this name are: patient name as entered on the scanner\ncomputer, scanner model, scanner serial number, session date, and session time.\n\nv1.5.0\nLoading the data\nTo open a file, just double-click on the icon or drag it onto the NeuroLens\nicon7. Each dataset should open in a new window. Note that the window\nfor series 9 shows a plot of the EPI8 signal in yellow by default, while the\nwindow for series 5 shows a large view of the central slice instead. You\ncan select large image views for series 9 using the tabs at the top of the\nwindow labeled Axial, Sagittal, and Coronal and conversely for series 5\nyou can view plots of spatial intensity profile by selecting the Plot tab\n(highlighted with green box in \"NeuroLens Volume Window\" Figure).\nSeries 5\n(structural)\nSeries 9\n(functional)\nViewing the data\nYou can adjust a number of display parameters using controls along the\nmenu bar at the top of the window. You can access a more extensive set\nof controls by clicking the \"Inspector\" item in the menu bar (this white \"i\"\non a blue background). Try adjusting the different parameters - the upper\nand lower window levels are the data values that map to the upper and\nlower end of the selected color space (below, yellow box). The default\ncolor space for data loaded directly from DICOM is grey - you can change\nthe colorspace using the popup menu button of the same name in the in\nspector.\nThe \"Coords\" tab of the Inspector Panel allows precise control of the cur\nsor location within a volume, and the \"Plot\" tab provides controls for the\ndisplay of signals. The \"ROI\" tab allows you to get statistics on data val\nues within a region of interest that you paint or derive from another data-\nset. Note that the controls in the Inspector Panel change when you select\n7 Only DICOM data requires you to open a Folder in NeuroLens, since scans are distrib\nuted across multiple files in a way that is generally not obvious from the file names.\n8 Echo-Planar-Imaging, the MRI technique used to perform high-speed imaging for func\ntional MRI.\n\nv1.5.0\na different window - the single panel always refers to the currently active\nwindow.\nNavigating through space\nYou can navigate to any point in the volume by pointing (clicking) and\ndragging in the image views in the window. As you move about, the nu\nmeric data value of the voxel under the cursor is displayed along the bot\ntom of the screen (magenta box) along with the spatial and time coordi\nnates.\nThe idea of this window design is that the three small tri-planar views and the plot\nprovide an overview of the dataset. You can get a more detailed view by selecting on\nof the large tab panes in the right of the window.\nYou can zoom in on the location of the cursor by dragging the slider below\neach of the large tabbed slice views. To see the whole image again just\nclick the small image at the left end of the zoom slider.\nInspector Panel\nColor Legend\nData Value\nView Selection Tabs\nAxial\nSagittal\nCoronal\nToolbar\nNeuroLens Volume Window\n\nv1.5.0\nNavigating through Time\nIn the functional scan, the default view\nshows a plot of the MRI signal in the large\ntab pane. You can navigate through\nspace in this data as described above,\nand also through time by clicking or drag\nging along the time axis in the plot9.\nWhen you drag along the time axis on the\nplot, pay careful attention to the image\nviews along the left of the window - you\nwill see variations in the noise over time\nand small shifts in the brainʼs position.\nDrag\nBy default the\nrange of the signal plot is set to include the\nmaximum value in the entire dataset, as well as\nzero. If you want to continuously re-scale the\naxes to cover the range of the current signal\n(providing a more detailed view), check the\nAutoscale checkbox in the lower right corner of\nthe plot tab pane.\n9 You can also step forwards or backwards through time by clicking on any image or plot\nview and holding down the right or left arrow key. Pressing the up and down arrow keys\nwill move along a spatial direction, depending on the last image view that was clicked.\n\nv1.5.0\nCoordinate Displays\nThe exact coordinates of the current cur\nsor location can be displayed in a number\nof ways:\n1.World Coordinates: these are the coor\ndinates in millimeters in the MRI scanner\nframe of reference. The origin is at the\ncenter of the gradient coils, and X Y and Z\nare along the corresponding gradient\naxes. X increases from subject left to sub\nject right, Y increases from posterior to an\nterior, and Z increases from inferior to su\nperior. In the case of a spatially normal\nized dataset, the world coordinates are in\nthe MNI space (approximately Talairach).\n2.Volume coordinates: these are coordi\nnates in millimeters along the rows, col\numns, and slice normals of a scan. The\norigin is at the lower left posterior corner of\nany volume. X increases along the most\nleft-pointing volume axis, Y increases\nalong the most anterior-pointing volume\naxis, and Z increases along the most\nsuperior-pointing volume axis.\n3.Index coordinates: these reflect the or\nder in which the digital pixel samples oc\ncur in the file and in the memory buffer\nCoords Tab used while a volume is loaded. The column co\nordinate is the fastest varying one, followed by\nrow, and finally slice.\nYou can specify exact coordinates using any of the above formats, under\nthe \"Coords\" tab of the Inspector panel. You can also set which format is\ndisplayed at the bottom of the window using the \"Coordinate Display Type\"\npopup button at the bottom of this tab (blue box, left), or by selecting Neu\nroLens > Preferences and setting the same control under the \"Volume\"\ntab.\n\nv1.5.0\nMosaic Display\nA useful feature is the ability to view all slices\nalong a given anatomic plane as a mosaic.\nThis can be easily done by clicking the \"Show\nAll Slices\" checkbox in the large view tabs10.\nThis works for all cardinal planes, and clicking\nat a location in the mosaic view will cause the\ntri-planar views and coordinates to update to\nthe correct coordinate. You can also step\nthrough time in the mosaic view by dragging\nthe frame or t sliders on the \"Coords\" Tab.\nViewing file metadata\nAnother useful feature is the ability to see descriptive information about a\ndataset. You can do this easily in Neu\nroLens by selecting File > Show file\nmetadata... in the main menu. This will\ncause a sheet containing a wide range\nof information about the data acquisition\nsettings, subject demographics, and\nother topics to drop down in the current\nwindow:\n10 You can also click in any image and press the \"m\" key to toggle mosaic mode. Select\nHelp > Mouse and Keyboard for a detailed list of keyboard shortcuts.\n\nv1.5.0\nTry clicking on the various tabs (Volume, Acquisition, Demographic, Dis\nplay, Processing, and Annotation). Note that some of this information can\nbe edited - the demographic tab allows you to edit information about the\nsubject (age, weight, etc.) and also to add new fields. Note that these ed\nits only affect the copy of the dataset in the application memory until you\nsave the file to disk.\nNote that under the Volume tab you can edit many of the parameters,\nsuch as the voxel step sizes and the data orientation (Axial vs. Sagittal vs.\nCoronal). Changes to these parameters will be reflected in the data dis\nplay in real time - this can be useful\nwhen loading non-standard files in\nwhich images are flipped or displayed\nin the wrong orientation. As noted be\nfore these edits do not effect the disk\nfile unless the dataset is saved by se\nlecting File > Save or File > Save As...\n\nv1.5.0\nEditing Geometry Parameters\nAfter experimenting with viewing and editing the file metadata, quit your\nNeuroLens session without saving your changes. You will re-load the\nMINC files in the next exercise.\n\nv1.5.0\nExercise 3: Pre-processing Image Data\nIn this section you will load the EPI series (9)\ncontaining the functional MRI data and perform\npreprocessing and statistical operations on it.\nAll processing modules in NeuroLens are im\nplemented as plugins, which means they can be\ndeveloped, packaged, and installed separately\nfrom the core application11. These processing\nmodules can be accessed under the Actions\nmenu, or by selecting the Action item on the\ntoolbar of a dataset window12.\nMost Actions provide their own\nonline help which should ex\nplain usage details and the underlying method used.\nThis can be accessed by clicking the purple \"?\" button in\nthe lower right corner of a Action menu, or by selecting\nHelp > Actions and selecting the appropriate Action\nname.\nRunning an Action usually produces a new dataset that opens in its own\nwindow without modifying the input dataset (the window that was selected\nwhen the Action was launched).\nLoad the Data\nFirst, load the MINC file for series 9 by double-clicking on the file. Inspect\nthis fMRI data for motion by dragging through time on the plot while ob\nserving the edges of the brain in the tri-planar views. This subject stayed\nfairly still, but you should be able to spot small positional shifts around the\nedges. Even small shifts like this can cause prominent artifacts in voxels\nat the edge of the brain.\nRun Motion Correction\nThe first pre-processing step you will apply is Motion Correction. This\nmodule tries to align each volume in the functional image series to a\nspecified target frame, to minimize the effects of subject motion during the\n11 This helps keep the main application simple and allows users to extend NeuroLens by\nadding their own custom functionality.\n12 Generally some Actions will be greyed out in the menu because they can not be ap\nplied to the current dataset. For example fMRI analysis does not make sense on a data-\nset that does not have a time dimension.\n\nv1.5.0\nscan13. Click on the \"Action\" item (the one with the gear icon) on the tool-\nbar of the window for series 9, select Motion Correction, and examine\nthe menu that appears. In most cases the default parameters that are\nsuggested will be appropriate and you can just click \"Ok\" to run the opera\ntion (donʼt do this yet though).\nIn this exercise, the only change you will\nmake is to request graphs of the motion cor\nrection parameters after running the Action.\nTo do this, select the Outputs tab of the Ac\ntion interface and select the Motion parame\nters checkbox.\nThe Action should take a few seconds to\nrun and will cause three new windows to\nopen: the motion-corrected dataset, a plot\nof the estimated brain translations (x,y,z)\nover time, and a plot of the brain rotations (x,y,z) over time.\nTranslations\nRotations\nAligned Series\nYou can determine the contents of each window by looking at the title bar\nof the window. In most cases, in addition to the file name14 there will be a\ndescription of the dataset as in the example below (Translation Parame\nters). The description of the aligned series is not changed - the descrip\ntion of the input dataset (the MRI protocol name) is used. You can identify\nthe motion-corrected series however by the suffix \"-MC.mnc\" that is added\nto the file name of the input:\n13 The motion correction Action is based on source code adapted from AFNIʼs 3dvolreg\nprogram and the method described in Real-Time 3D Image Registration for Functional\nMRI. Bob Cox and Andrzej Jesmanowicz. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine\n42:1014-1018 (1999). We have simplified the code and optimized it to use the Macʼs\nhardware vector processor (AltiVec) for increased performance.\n14 Note that the output of an Action is not written to disk by default, so in this case there is\nno actual file until you invoke a File > Save or File > Save As...\n\nv1.5.0\nExamine the plots of the X, Y, and Z translation parameters (red, green,\nand blue respectively). You should notice that the Y translation (green)\nshows a consistent negative drift15. The motion correction plots are shown\nin units of millimeters (translation) and degrees (rotation). The vertical\naxes are by default set to a range of ±2 mm and ±2 degrees, to provide a\nconsistent scaling for the evaluation of motion16.\nCompare the image stability in the original series with that of the motion-\ncorrected series by dragging the mouse along the time axis in the plot\nwhile carefully inspecting the edges of the brain in the slice views. It can\nalso be helpful to \"blink\" back and forth between the beginning and end of\nthe series by clicking (not dragging) near both ends of the time axis.\nWhen you have finished looking at the scans, close all the windows except\nfor the motion-corrected series (which will be used in the next section).\nRun Spatial Smoothing\nThe next step in preprocessing is to spatially filter the data. This amounts\nto smoothing each volume using a 3D Gaussian kernel in order to improve\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (at the expense of image resolution). This prac\ntice is acceptable (in moderation) since the activated regions of interest in\nmany studies are diffuse and span many voxels. Moreover the contrast-\nto-noise ratio in many experiments is too low to detect parenchymal acti\nvation without smoothing17.\n15 As noted above, X is left-to-right, Y is posterior-to-anterior, and Z is inferior-to-superior.\nNegative Y is therefore in the posterior direction. This is often seen as the pillow under\nthe subjectʼs head compresses over time.\n16 Full-scale motions (i.e. of 2mm or 2o) would be considered large. However the impact\nof this on the quality of the eventual result depends strongly on the nature of the move\nment. Gradual drifts in position can be well corrected even if they result in a final position\nseveral millimeters away from the start, and sudden jerks of just a millimeter can cause\nsevere intensity fluctuations by disrupting the excitation history of a slice.\n17 Acquiring fMRI data at a higher resolution and then smoothing to a lower resolution is\noften necessary because acquiring the initial data at too low a resolution will cause ex\ncessive susceptibility artifact.\n\nv1.5.0\nTo smooth the data, select the window\ncontaining the motion-corrected series by\nclicking on it. Then open the Action by se\nlecting Spatial Smoothing under the Ac\ntion item on this windowʼs toolbar. The\nsheet displayed on the left should open.\nIn this case we will smooth at the default 6\nmm width18, so you can just click OK to\nrun the Action.\nA single new window should open, con\ntaining the spatially smoothed dataset.\nThe new dataset will appear visibly\nblurred, but much of the anatomic informa\ntion (in this already low resolution scan) should still be discernible. The\nrange of noise fluctuations visible on the signal (yellow plot) should be\nsmaller after smoothing19. You can inspect the signal at the same location\nin two or more open datasets by ⌘-clicking in an image of one of them.\nThis will cause the cursor to go to the same location in world coordinates\nin all open datasets20.\nKeep the spatially smoothed dataset open (its file name will have the suffix\n-MC-SM.mnc) for the next exercise. You may close the previous file\n(whose name ends with -MC.mnc) if you like.\n18 The width is the full-width-at-half-max (FWHM) of the Gaussian smoothing kernel in all\nthree directions. Note that it is specified in millimeters and not in pixels, and that the\nsmoothing takes place between slices as well as within slices.\n19 If you click in background voxels with Autoscale turned on, you will notice that the sig\nnal appears discretized. This is due to the fact that the integer storage type of the data-\nset is preserved, and the data values can therefore only assume integer values.\n20 Because the world coordinates are synchronized between datasets, the cursor should\ngo to the corresponding brain location in any dataset acquired in that scanning session -\neven if the spatial resolution and slice angulations are different.\n\nv1.5.0\nExercise 4: Statistical analysis of data\nNow you are ready to perform an actual statistical analysis on the data.\nThis will consist of modeling the signal over time at each voxel as the sum\nof a set of a hypothetical response waveforms plus a constant and drift\nterms21. The response waveform is elevated during the periods where a\nparticular stimulus or task was applied. Since there may be more than\none stimulus type applied during the experiment, you can specify more\nthan one response waveform22. The linear modeling action computes\nweighting parameters to apply to the different waveforms to produce the\nbest fit, defined as producing the minimum sum of squared errors, to a\ngiven signal (this is done at each voxel).\nThis is illustrated in the figure below, where two response waveforms, plus\na constant and three drift terms (blue traces, left) are combined to produce\nthe purple signal on the right as an approximation to the observed signal\nat a voxel (yellow). The parameter values applied to the five waveforms\nare listed at the top of the plot on the right23. Note that the use of two re\nsponse waveforms allows the different blocks of activation to have differ\nent heights.\nFitting a Linear Signal Model\n21 This approach is commonly referred to as the Generalized Linear Model or GLM. Vari\nants of this method are used in most major fMRI packages such as SPM, AFNI, and FSL.\n22 These waveforms may also be referred to as basis functions or regressors.\n23 These graphs are taken directly from the NeuroLens views used to specify a model\nand display the fit.\n\nv1.5.0\nThe model fit produces estimates at each voxel of the response ampli\ntudes (the model parameters) and a measure of the residual error (differ\nence between the model and the actual data - in practice the standard er\nror is used24). The probability of a response being \"present\" (i.e. not a\nrandom noise fluctuation) at a voxel is computed by dividing the estimated\neffect size by the residual standard error and computing the p-value for\nthis ratio (the T-statistic). To assess an individual run, you would view the\nT-statistic or the negative logarithm of the corresponding p-value. The ef\nfect size and standard error can also be viewed and saved (these are\nused as inputs to higher level group analyses). Usually we are interested\nin the significance of a specific combination of response waveforms, and\nthese are generally expressed as a contrast. A contrast is simply a list of\nvalues (one for each basis function) indicating the weight it is to be given\nin computing the summary output. In the example illustrated in the figure\nabove, a contrast of \"1 0 0 0 0 0\" would produce maps of T-statistic, effect\nsize, and standard error including only responses to the first basis function\n(the top one in the graph on the left)25. Now we are ready to run the\nanalysis.\nRun Linear Modeling\nTo fit a linear model to the spatially smoothed\ndataset, click on its window and select Linear\nModeling from the toolbar Action item. The\nsheet shown on the left will open in its own\nwindow. The first thing you will do is specify\nthe stimulus timing (the design). One way to do\nthis is to enter the design as \"Sampled Regres\nsors\" by clicking on the pull down menu and\nchanging from \"Table of Events\" (see screen\nshot to the left). In this format, each stimulus\ntype is represented as a sequence of numbers\n(typically 0ʼs and 1ʼs) separated by spaces.\nThe numbers should be separated by spaces\n(no commas) and are read from left to right, top\nto bottom. If there is more than one stimulus\ntype, they can be represented one after the\nother in the editor (white space is ignored).\n24 Calculated by computing the square root of the average squared error and dividing by\nthe degrees of freedom for the effect (a value slightly less than the number of image\nframes).\n25 A contrast of \"1 -1 0 0 0 0\" would provide the difference in response to the first and\nsecond function. The basis functions for which the contrast is zero are often called re\ngressors of no interest. If we want to we can test for any regressor however. A contrast\nof \"0 0 0 1 0 0\" would test for a linear drift.\n\nRight Hemifield\nStimulation\nLeft Hemifield\nStimulation\nv1.5.0\nYou can type this expression directly into the text view on the sheet, or\nread it from a text file (.rtf or .txt). We have provided a text file containing\na representation of the visual stimulation applied to the subject when se\nries 9 was acquired. Load the design now by clicking the button labeled\n\"Read file...\" and navigate to the disk image containing the tutorial. There\nyou will find a file called \"Stimulus Timing.rtf\". Select this file and click\n\"Open\". The contents of the file should be displayed in the design expres\nsion editor and a checkmark should appear beneath it, signifying that the\ndesign is valid for this dataset26. After you have performed this step the\naction interface should look like this:\nStimulus Block\nRight Hemifield\nStimulation\nLeft Hemifield\nStimulation\n26 If the design expression is not valid, a red ! symbol will appear. Usually this is due to\nthe use of commas in the expression or because the number of values supplied is not a\nmultiple of the number of frames.\n\nv1.5.0\nThe design entered describes two stimulus types (visual stimulation of the\nleft and right halves of the visual field)27.\nTo visualize the design bring up the \"HRF\nand Model\" window, displayed on the left,\nwhich should have opened when the Linear\nModeling Action was first run. The bottom\nwindow pane shows the two stimulus types\nyou have specified (green waveform, fol\nlowed by blue waveform) plus a third order\npolynomial used to model baseline plus\ndrift. Itʼs a good idea to always look at this\nview after entering a design to make sure it\nlooks as expected.\nYou may notice that the response wave\nforms appear to have been slightly\nsmoothed (the corners are rounded). This\nis due to the application of an assumed\nhemodynamic response function (HRF) in\nthis analysis mode. This is intended to ac\ncount for the fact that the BOLD response28 is not instantaneous but rather\noccurs with a small lag and dispersion. This is usually described using the\nimpulse response (the response to an idealized short stimulus), which has\nbeen found to be reasonably approximated in fMRI by the sum of one or\nmore gamma functions29. The HRF used in the current model is viewed\nas the red waveform in the top pane of the above screenshot. The view\nshows a plot of the assumed HRF sampled with the inter-scan interval of\nthe input series. You can modify the parameters of the HRF by clicking on\nthe \"HRF\" pane of the Linear Modeling actionʼs window. From this page,\nyou can also change the polynomial drift order or perform pre-whitening of\n27 Periods where a given stimulus was applied are specified by a value of one in each\nsequence in this example. The number sequences for the two stimulus types are sepa\nrated by a blank line for clarity (white space is ignored). Note that the organization of\nstimulus blocks into rows of values is optional (also for clarity). The above design could\njust as well be specified by a single column with 180 rows, or by entering all 180 values\non a single line.\n28 The blood oxygenation level-dependent response that is the most commonly used con\ntrast mechanism in functional MRI.\n29 The default in NeuroLens is to use a single gamma function, which approximates the\nsmall delay and dispersion of the response. Some (but not all) stimulus types lead to\nresponses in which an overshoot and undershoot are seen. This can be modelled by\nadding a second negative gamma function with suitable width and delay. Checking the\n\"Undershoot\" box will do this.\n\nv1.5.0\nthe data using the AR1 parameter. For this exercise you do not need to\nchange any of the settings from their default values.\nThe final bit of configuration you need to do before\nrunning the Linear Modeling Action is to specify the\ncontrast. You can view and change this by clicking\nthe \"Contrasts\" tab of the Linear Modeling actionʼs\nsheet. The default contrast in NeuroLens is always a\nsingle \"one\"30. This will test for a non-zero value of\nthe first regressor. Change the contrast by clicking\non the number \"1\" in the list31. Change the default\n\"1\" to \"1 -1\". This will test the difference between the\nresponses to left and right hemifield stimultion at\neach voxel. Now change the default \"Contrast #1\" to\nsomething more descriptive like \"Left - Right\". When\nyou are finished the list should look like the one on\nthe left.\nNow you are ready to go! Click the RUN button to run the action. In a few\nseconds a map of the -log(p) value32 should appear in a new window33.\nYou should also see a new curve plotted in purple in the window of the in\nput dataset. This is the estimated signal model at the current cursor loca\ntion. Compare with the yellow observed signal.\n30 The contrast string entered in the sheet is padded with zeros so that its length equals\nthe number of regressors. For convenience you only have to specify up to the last non\nzero value.\n31 It is possible to evaluate several contrasts at once. You can add additional contrasts\nby clicking the \"+\" button below the list.\n32 this is the negative logarithm of the p value associated with the T statistic for that voxel.\n33 Other output maps are available and can be selected under the \"Output\" tab of the ac\ntion sheet. For this exercise you will just produce the default map of -log(p).\n\nv1.5.0\nInput dataset with\nMap of -log(p)\nmodel fit\nView the model and activation map\nHere it will also be useful to synchronize coordinates in multiple windows\nby ⌘-clicking at very red or blue locations in the -log(p) map 34. After doing\nthis look at the signal in the input dataset (the spatially smoothed one).\nThe appropriate response term (left or right stimulation) should be very\nprominent in the modeled and observed signals.\nOverlay the activation map on other scans\nThe activation map alone is difficult to interpret because there is no anat\nomic contrast. This can be addressed easily in NeuroLens by overlaying\nthe activation map on the source EPI scan or, better yet, on the subjectʼs\nhigh-resolution anatomic scan.\n34 The -log(p) map is by default displayed using the Spectral color scale. In addition the\n-log(p) map is also displayed with symmetric windowing, which means the upper and\nlower window limits will be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. This forces zero val\nues to be green regardless of the overall data range. In the Spectral color scale \"colder\"\ncolors (blue, purple, black) denote negative response while \"hotter\" colors (yellow, red,\nwhite) denote positive activation.\n\nv1.5.0\nOverlay the -log(p) map on the time-\nseries EPI scan by clicking the\npopup button marked \"Overlay\" in\nthe toolbar of the EPI time series\nand selecting the -log(p) map from\nthe list that appears35. The statisti\ncal map should immediately be dis\nplayed as a transparent overlay over\nthe EPI scan. You can adjust the\nopacity of the overlay by dragging\nthe Opacity slider in the Inspector\npanel. You can also set a threshold\nbelow which values in the overlay\ndataset are made completely trans\nparent. Note that when an overlay is\nactive, the color legend, content de\nscription, and some image controls\nfor the overlay are displayed in the\nInspector panel for the underlay. You\ncan remove the overlay by setting the\nOverlay popup in the toolbar to\n\"None\"36.\nOverlaying the -log(p) map on the\nEPI scan from which it was derived\nseems natural because they have\nthe same image dimensions. In\nNeuroLens it is also possible to over\nlay an activation map on a high-\nresolution anatomic scan even\nthough the image dimensions and\nslice angulations are in general dif\nferent. The procedure is the same\nas before - just open the anatomic\nscan from the demo dataset (series\n5) and select the -log(p) map from\n35 You can also assign this overlay by holding down the Option key and dragging one of\nthe -log(p) map images over the window of the EPI dataset and dropping it onto one of\nthe EPI image views. A third way is to click in a -log(p) map window, select Edit > Copy,\nand then Edit > Paste after clicking in an image view of the EPI series.\n36 You can also remove an overlay by clicking in any image view and typing \"x\".\n\nv1.5.0\nthe list under the Overlay popup in the windowʼs toolbar37. The -log(p)\nmap will be immediately interpolated onto the high resolution scan, allow\ning you to view the functional information in a much better anatomic con\ntext.\nSave the statistical map\nSave the map of -log(p) to disk by clicking on its window and selecting File\n> Save As... from the main menu. You should save it to the same folder\nas the converted MINC files for series 5 and 9.\nLeave the individualʼs -log(p) map and high-resolution anatomic scan open\nfor the next exercise.\nView the processing history\nA useful feature of NeuroLens is the ability to view the processing history\nof a dataset. This can be done simply be selecting File > Show file me\ntadata... . The \"Processing\" tab in the sheet that opens (shown below)\ncontains a list of the processing steps used to generate the dataset in\nquestion. Clicking the disclosure triangle of a step reveals the settings\nused for that operation. Under the Processing tab there is also a vertical\ntab containing Results and Settings. The Results pane shows any de\nscriptive parameters that were computed in a processing step (e.g. de\ngrees of freedom in a statistical analysis).\n37 You can also copy and paste (⌘-C/⌘-V) an image onto another dataset to assign it as\nan overlay. This way is often easier if the windows are overlapping.\n\nv1.5.0\nExercise 5: Spatial normalization\nIt is often desirable to transform an individualʼs brain data into a standard\nized coordinate system so that visualization may be performed under\nmore consistent settings or so the data can be pooled for group statistical\nanalysis.\nNeuroLens provides a module which allows you to compute the transfor\nmation required to align an individualʼs whole-brain EPI scan with a group\naverage EPI brain38 in Talairach coordinates. Once this transformation is\ncomputed, it can be applied to the individualʼs activation maps to resample\nthem into a standard format that can then be used for visualization or\ngroup statistical analysis.\nThe Volume Registration Action allows you to supervise the fitting proce\ndure. If the fit begins to go off track, you can pause the automatic fit and\nadjust the transformation parameters manually. You can then resume the\nfit to see if the numerical optimization will converge to an optimal solution.\nRun the Volume Registration Action\nMake sure the individualʼs EPI series (#9) is open. Click on its window to\nmake it current, then select Actions > Volume Registration. The window\nshown below should open:\n38 Some software packages compute a transform based on the subjectʼs high-resolution\nanatomic scan and then apply this to their activation maps, which are derived from the\nsubjectʼs EPI scans. We chose to focus on an EPI-based alignment because it is the EPI\nscans which need to be accurately aligned for group analysis. Moreover it appears that\nEPI-based registrations may be less prone to bad fits due to the numerical optimization\nprocedure getting trapped in local minima.\n\nv1.5.0\nThe \"Setup\" tab displayed by default shows the settings used in the multi\nstep alignment procedure. Three passes are performed, with successively\nless smoothing and subsampling of the source and target datasets. Each\nstep also includes a different set of alignment parameters that are allowed\nto vary - these can be selected using the checkboxes in the columns for\nthe different fit parameters. We will use the default steps here.\nTo start the registration procedure you will\nneed to specify a target (the \"Fit\" button is\ndisabled until you do so). You will use a\ngroup average EPI scan in MNI space as a\ntarget. To open this dataset, click the button\nlabeled \"Show Standard Targets\". This will\ncause the sheet shown on the left to open.\nSelect the file 3T-EPI-Target.mnc and click\n\"Open\". The selected target39 should open in\na new dataset window and it will be assigned\nas the target in the\naction window.\nClick on the Volume Registration window to\nmake it current again, and select the \"Fitting\"\ntab to see a display of the fitting progress. At\nthis point the progress display will show the\ninput dataset (series 9) overlaid on the target\nwith no transformation applied:\n40 Subject 3T EPI Target\n39 This dataset is an average of 40 gradient-echo EPI scans acquired from different indi\nviduals at 3 Tesla and registered to the MNI standard space.\n\nv1.5.0\nAs you would expect, there is substantial misregistration at the start. To\nbegin the alignment, click the \"Fit\" button. You can follow the progress of\nthe fit in the three overlay views - the opacity of the overlay can be modi\nfied using the vertical slider to the right of the views. You should see the\ninput dataset (blueish purple) aligned reasonably well over the target\n(greyscale).\nWhen the text for \"Current Registration\nPhase\" changes to \"Finished\" the reg\nistration is complete. At this point a\ntransformation has been computed that\nrepresents the optimal alignment of the\nsource to the target. You can open this\ntransformation as a document40 by\nclicking the \"Open Transform\" button\nunder the \"Fitting\" tab of the Volume\nRegistration Action. A new window will\nopen like the one shown on the left. To\nsave this transform, click on the trans\nform window and select File > Save\nAs...\nThe saved transform can be loaded later and assigned as the initial trans\nform of the Volume Registration Action. You can then use the action to\nresample volumes using this transform.\n40 A document is any data that can be loaded in NeuroLens using the File > Open com\nmand. Documents are displayed in the Recent Files menu and under the Windows\nmenu. Supported document types include volumes (which may be time series), surfaces,\nfiber tracts, and transforms.\n\nv1.5.0\nMake sure you leave the Volume Registration window open, because weʼll\nuse it in the next step of this exercise.\nResample the activation map\nNow youʼve computed the transform, but it hasnʼt been applied to any da\ntasets. First weʼll resample the -log(p) map generated in the previous ex\nercise using the computed transform. Make sure the -log(p) map is still\nopen from the previous exercise41. In the window of the Volume Registra\ntion Action, select the \"Resampling\" tab. Configure the two popup buttons\nin the interface so they look as shown below:\nThis will cause the -log(p) map (suffix -logp-c1.mnc) to be resampled at\nthe voxel locations of the EPI target (a standard voxel grid) using the\ncomputed transform. Note that at this point you will not be able to change\nthe transform (that popup is dimmed), because the current instance of the\nVolume Registration Action has been used to perform a fit. If no fit has\nbeen performed you can set the transform popup to any loaded transform\ndocument (allowing you to resample a dataset using a transform loaded\nfrom disk). Click the \"Resample\" button, and in a few seconds you should\nsee a new window open with a resampled copy of the -log(p) map.\nNow click in a slice image of the resampled\n-log(p) map and type ⌘-C (copy to clipboard),\nthen click in a slice image of 3T-EPI-Target.mnc\nand type ⌘-V (paste). This will cause the re-\nsampled statistical map to be overlaid on the tar\nget. You should see the regions of visual activa\ntion overlaid at the approprate locations in the\noccipital lobe (as shown at left).\n-log(p) map overlaid\non EPI target\n41 By now you may have several windows open, which can be cluttered on a small dis\nplay. This is a good situation to use Expose, which allows you to tile windows. To ar\nrange all of the NeuroLens windows side by side, press the F10 key. It should then be\neasy to select the -log(p) map.\n\nv1.5.0\nVerify the registration\nIt is generally a good idea to check the registration quality by resampling\neither the individualʼs anatomic scan or their EPI scan and overlaying it on\nthe target dataset. Using the steps described above for the resampling\nstage (keep the Volume Registration window open - you donʼt need to\nredo the fit), resample the subjectʼs anatomic scan (series 5) and their EPI\nscan (used as input to the Volume Registration) with the already computed\ntransform and overlay it on the EPI target. You should see a fairly good fit,\nalthough being a linear transformation it will never be perfect.\nLocate peaks in the activation map\nIt is often desirable to locate the set of peaks in the -log(p) map that are\nabove (or below) a certain threshold. This can be done by clicking on the\nwindow of the spatially normalized copy of the -log(p) map and selecting\nActions > Find Peaks. The sheet below should open:\nFor this exercise specify an amplitude threshold of 10 (p≤10-10) and a clus\nter size threshold of 625 voxels (about 5 ml). Click OK to run the action,\nand a window like the one shown below should open.\nThe new window contains two tabs, \"Positive\" and \"Negative\". These con\ntain a list of all the local maxima (or minima) at which the absolute value of\n\nv1.5.0\nthe data value exceeds the specified threshold (in this case 10) over at\nleast 625 adjacent voxels (5 ml)42. Note that there can be several local\nmaxima within each cluster. By default the table is sorted so that the\nhighest value in the whole dataset is at the top of the list (the most nega\ntive value will be at the top of the list under the Negative tab). The world\ncoordinates of each local maximum are also given - in this case, because\nthe input dataset is in MNI-Talairach coordinates, these values are the\nMNI-Talairach coordinates of the peak. If we were to operate on a native\nspace (non-spatially normalized) dataset these coordinates would simply\nbe in the world system for the session.\nThe cluster ID refers to the set of contiguous voxels in which a peak lies.\nThese can be displayed by checking the \"Cluster IDs\" box when running\nthe action. The cluster IDs are assigned in decreasing order of cluster\nsize (largest = 1)43. The cluster volume in milliliters is also given. The\ncolumn labeled \"Comments\" can be used to annotate the peaks.\n42 This may seem like a lot of voxels, but remember that the spatially normalized -log(p)\nmap has been resampled onto a sampling grid with a spacing of only 2 mm.\n43 The rows of the table can be sorted based on any of the columns. To group all cluster\nIDs together click on the Cluster ID column heading. Within clusters the secondary sort\norder will be whatever was in effect before re-sorting. Clicking the Peak heading followed\nby the Cluster ID heading will group clusters together with peaks sorted by height.\n\nv1.5.0\nNote that, if you double-click any row of the tables, the cursor location in\nall open datasets will go the coordinates of that peak. Try double clicking\non the first row of your list of positive peaks (the entry in the Value column\nshould be 66.52757). The cursor in the spatially normalized -log(p) map\nshould go to the hottest spot in the entire volume44. Conversely if you ⌘\nclick at a location in the spatially normalized -log(p) map, the closest row\nin the table will automatically be selected. Try these actions (double\nclicking table rows and ⌘-clicking in the input dataset) a few times to get\nfamiliar with this feature.\nYou can export the annotated list of peaks to any word processing or\nspreadsheet program by selecting the peaks you want (⌘-A to select all)\nand clicking the button labeled \"Copy selected rows to clipboard\". Then\nselect the document where you want to insert the table and perform a\n44 Note that the coordinates in the non-normalized volumes will not be correct, since the\npeaks are listed in the space of the normalized -log(p) map.\n\nv1.5.0\npaste (⌘-V). We will look at more methods of exporting data in the next\nlesson.\nPeaks table exported to\nExcel spreadsheet\nIn the final lesson you will need the spatially normalized copies of the sub\njectʼs anatomic scan and their -log(p) map. Save these to disk and/or\nleave them open in NeuroLens. You will also use the native space -log(p)\nmap and original EPI scan.\n\nv1.5.0\nLesson 6: exporting results\nNow that you have performed a complete analysis of an fMRI run45, it may\nbe useful to export the results to a word processing program or email them\nto a colleague. NeuroLens has a number of features which makes this\nconvenient.\nArranging the figure\nOpen or select the spatially normalized -log(p) map. Click in any of the\nslice images and type ⌘-C to copy this dataset to the clipboard. Press\nthe F10 key to tile the dataset windows via Expose and select the spatially\nnormalized anatomic map. Click in an image view of the normalized anat\nomic map and type ⌘-V to paste the -log(p) map.\nCopying and pasting images\nNow open the Inspector for the normalized\nanatomic scan by clicking the Inspector toolbar\nitem (or typing ⌘-I)46. Type a value of 20 into\nthe Threshold field in the Overlay box and hit\nreturn47. Drag the Opacity slider in the Overlay\narea all the way to the right so the value is 1.0.\nUncheck the Visible box under the Cursor area\nto make the cursor invisible. The axial view of\nthe overlay should look like the image on the\nright, with most of the activation map transpar\nent (the regions below the threshold).\nTo export this graphic, open a Word document\nor email. Click in the NeuroLens image you\nwish to export, and type ⌘-C to copy the image. Then click in the docu\nment and type ⌘-V to paste the image. This works on both slice images\nand plot views.\nYou may also want to grab a copy of the color legend. Just click on the\ncolor legend in the Overlay area of the normalized anatomic scanʼs In\n45 Group analyses will be covered in Tutorial II.\n46 ⌥ refers to the Option key.\n47 Entering values into text boxes generally does not take effect until you type return or\ntab to leave the text box and commit the change.\n\nv1.5.0\nspector panel, type ⌘-C, and paste it into the document by typing ⌘-V 48.\nThe result should look like this:\n-60\n-40\n-20\nIf you want to paste the color legend into a document (like a slide) with a\ndark background, you can change the default text color used when copy\ning by opening the Preferences window and clicking on the color well un\nder the Copy & Paste tab:\nYou can also adjust the colors and display settings used for plots of sig\nnals. This can be useful in adapting figures for export into non-color\ndocuments or slides.\n48 Most things that can be done using copy and paste can also be done by Option-\ndragging the item you wish to export. ⌘-C is a shortcut for Edit > Copy.\n\nv1.5.0\n!: 26.225 1.495 718.718 4.105 1.441 -0.033 (3.4%)\n!: 26.225 1.495 718.718 4.105 1.441 -0.033 (3.4%)\nSignal (au)\nSignal (au)\nTime (s)\nTime (s)\nAdjusting plot display settings\nThe adjustment shown above was achieved using the plot settings in the\nInspector panel shown below.\n\nv1.5.0\nPlot display settings\nThe plot display settings can be changed using\nthe controls shown on the left. You change plot\ncolors by selecting a signal in the Plot list and\nclicking the color well in the box labeled\nSelection. Note that you can select multiple\nrows in the list (!-clicking or !-A) and adjust\nthe parameters in the Selection box. The\nchanges will be applied to all selected rows.\nThe color and weight of the axes as well as the\nfonts used can be adjusted using the controls in\nthe Axes box. If you want your changes to be\npropagated to all open datasets you can click\nthe \"Use for all\" button. If \"Only same type\" is\nselected then only datasets with the same\ncontent description (seen in the title bar) will be\nchanged.\nSaving image graphics to disk\nIn addition to copying and pasting, you\nmay want to save an image in NeuroLens\nto a disk file. This can be done easily by\ncontrol-clicking on the image and select\ning \"Save image to file...\". In the Save\ndialogue that opens select the folder\nwhere you want to put the file, give it a\nname, and click Save.\nThe save format will be either TIFF or\nPDF - you can set this under NeuroLens\n> Preferences > Copy & Paste as shown\nbelow.\n\nv1.5.0\nPDF is a vector format that will allow plots, text, and the cursor crosshair\nto be scaled without loss of quality. You can load the PDF file into pro\ngrams like Adobe Illustrator if you need to fine-tune the appearance. TIFF\nis best suited for image data.\nExporting data for use by other programs\nSometimes itʼs useful to export the\nactual numerical data for further\nprocessing in a program like Mat-\nlab or Excel. This can be done by\ncopying the signal values to the\nclipboard and pasting into another\nprogram or by saving the values to\na text file.\n\nv1.5.0\nConclusion\nThis concludes the first NeuroLens tutorial. Hopefully you now have a feel\nfor how to perform basic operations in the software, providing you with the\ntools needed to analyze an fMRI run. Topics not covered here include\ngroup statistical analysis, region of interest (ROI) analysis, and surface-\nbased visualization. These will be covered in subsequent tutorials.\nWhere to get help\nThere are several sources of help and documentation for NeuroLens.\nThese include:\n- online help for NeuroLens and actions accessed using the Apple help\nsystem\n- an online userʼs forum at http://www.neurolens.org/forums/ where you\ncan post questions, feature requests, and report bugs.\n- these tutorials\nHopefully these will be useful!"

Voxels whose time course\nmatch the model with statistical significance are nonzero (i.e. either yellow or blue, not\ngreen). There are two such regions located sidebyside near the posterior section (i.e. to\nwards the rear) of the brain; this area is known as the visual cortex.\na.Do these regions appear to be in the right places based on how the visual fields\nmap to the visual cortex? Explain.\nYes, these regions do appear to be in the right places. The contrast we use\nto generate this statistical map was [1 1], which yields positive tstatistic\nvalues corresponding to regions with a stronger response to the lefthemi\nfield stimulus than to the righthemifield stimulus, and negative tstatistic\nvalues corresponding to regions with stronger responses to the righthemi\nfield stimulus than the left. As a result, the *right* occipital lobe is the main\nregion showing positives values, and the *left* region shows negative val\nues. This is consistent with the *contralateral* retinotopic mapping of the\nvisual system, i.e., the left hemifield is mapped onto the right side and the\nright hemifield is mapped on to the left one.\nb.One of these regions is yellow (I.e. positive), and one is blue (i.e. negative). Why\nis this the case? Does the negative patch indicate a region of deactivation as op\nposed to activation?\nThe negative values in the left occipital area don't necessarily indi\ncate deactivation, and most likely indicate activation. These values\nare negative because of the contrast we specify. These negative val\nues indicate that those voxels in the left occipital area show weaker\n(less positive) response to the lefthemifield stimulus than to the\nrighthemifield one. In other words, the left occipital area may be ac\ntivated by both types of stimuli (which can be shown by using the\ncontrasts [1 0] and [0 1]), it was just that the activation was stronger\nunder the righthemifield stimuli. In fact, if one examines the time se\nries of the voxels in the left occipital area, one should be able to see\nthat for most of the voxels, there is positive activation during the\nstimuli on both sides, but the response amplitude was apparently\ngreater under the right stimuli than under the left ones. However,\nthere are indeed some voxels in the left occipital area, especially\n\nthose located more rostrally and ventrally, which do appear to be de\nactivated by stimuli in the contralateral hemifield. This is true for\nboth hemispheres.\nc.There are also blue and yellow patches in other areas of the brain. Command\nclick on some of these voxels to see the corresponding timecourse and model fit in\nthe original data window. Do you think we have located new functional areas outside\nthe visual cortex that respond to visual stimulation?\n←Most of the other blue or yellow voxels are false positives and unlikely repre\nsentative of additional functional areas (although it can't be completely ruled\nout). Most of them are located in or along the ventricles or along (but outside\nof) the ventral and lateral surfaces of the brain. These regions are known to\nbe subject to susceptibility artifacts resulting from inhomogeneities where the\nbrain tissue meets nasal or oral cavities, eye sockets, etc, or to motion prob\nlems that aren't entirely corrected (e.g. if the subject shifts a little to the left,\nthen on the far right there's no brain where there used to be), or to other physi\nological sources of noise. The combination of the increased noise and the\nspatial smoothing probably made it look like there were areas of activation\nwhere there in fact weren't any.\n←A couple of you suggested that a few blue areas corresponded to optic\nnerve and therefore were true activations; I accepted this. However, take a\nlook at the time course; it suggests that the same stimulus produces _oppo\nsite effects_; i.e. our stimulus paradigm in both designs had two ON periods,\nand in this region, each of the ON periods produced opposite effects. Hard for\nme to believe this is physiological... Because of our [1 1] contrast, it received\na significant tscore. .\n2.Why was spatial smoothing done when analyzing the fMRI data? Could we not smooth\nthe data before model fitting? What would be benefits and drawbacks of this more direct\napproach?\n←From Huettel, page 277:\n←\"All fMRI data have spatial correlation due to both functional similarity of adjacent\nbrain regions and to blurring introduced by the vascular system. By using a filter\nthat matches the expected spatial correlation of the data, one can increase SNR con\nsiderably with minimal loss of spatial resolution.\"\n←Of course in reality, we don't know the spatial extent of the correlation, so we don't\nknow the ideal filter size. As a result, we could indeed increase SNR by smoothing,\nbut we could also lose some spatial resolution (drawback).\n\n←Additionally, spatial smoothing will lower falsepositive rate and random \"salt and\npepper\" activations that are noise in reality. See figure on pg 277.\n←We could of course not smooth the data to ensure the highest spatial resolution,\nbut of course, we'll take a hit in SNR; if we don't have enough detection power, we\ncould miss activation completely.\n3.In this exercise, we performed modelfitting in one operation, implementing the two de\nsign regressors as well as the polynomial drift terms. Some researchers remove polynomi\nal drift terms to first create a driftcorrected data set. They then perform their modelfitting\nusing the design regressors on this driftcorrected set. Is this a better/ worse/ equivalent\napproach? Explain.\n←This was a fun one, and you guys provided some great answers! Basically, I took\nmost of your answers, if they were reasonably well thought out.\nHaving said that, I (and the two fMRI stats guys I checked with :) am a firm believer\nthat if there is any chance that your design terms and drift terms have ANY degree of\ncolinearity (i.e. they are not completely orthogonal), you should include all terms in\nyour model and perform multiple regression in a single step. You will get the highest\ntscores this way. Essentially, if you fit in two steps, and there are there is real acti\nvation that can be modeled by the drift (i.e. drift and design are not orthogonal), you\nwill remove this signal. This signal is essentially lost, and will not get fit by your real\ndesign matrix, whose betas contribute to the tscore. Now yes, even if you model in\na single step, you will fit some of your designrelated signal to drift terms however,\nbecause you are ALSO fitting with the true design matrix (which should fit the activa\ntionrelated signal better), you'll get higher betadesign and a smaller betadrift leading to a\nhigher tstatistic. Another way of looking it at, is that your overall residual error will\nbe smaller when all regressors are fit at once, since the fit is more \"accurate\". This\nwould improve the sensitivity in the activation maps, since the residual error goes\ninto the denominator of the tstatistic fraction.\n←Many of you suggested that a twostep approach will decrease your DOF, and\ntherefore increase your tscore. This is true, but for most fMRI experiments with\nnumber of measurements in the 100's, I think this is a very small effect; think about\nsqrt(200) versus sqrt(197). You'll see that the better fit by performing multiple re\ngression in one step has an overwhelming effect, most of time.\n←Now, what if the design and drift terms are perfectly orthogonal?! Well, the two ap\nproaches are identical, save for the DOF!! The residuals and beta values should be\nexactly the same, and the more DOF will benefit the twostep approach, albeit very\nslightly.\n\n←In sum, for most scenarios where there is significant independence between drift\nand true activation signal, either way works well, and results are similar. Use an ex\ntreme case as an example; consider a 60 s OFF period followed by a 60s ON period\nand a linear drift term. These terms are quite colinear; if you model in two steps,\nyou'll really miss activation.... Try it!\n←\n4.Run the Linear Modeling Action once more. After entering the design matrix, and specify\ning the contrasts, click on the \"Ouputs\" tab. Unclick log(p) and choose \"Standard error for\neffect\" check boxes. Change the \"Treshold\" level to zero. Click \"Run\". The standard error\nfor effect window should popup.\na.Choose the standard error window; move from the inferior to superior (lower to\nhigher) slices of the brain using the mouse pointer or the scrollwheel. Notice that\nthe orbits (eyes) are considerably brighter (i.e. positive) than most of the brain tissue.\nWhy would this be the case?\nb.Qualitatively, what is the standard error map telling you? For optimal detection,\nwhat would we like to see in this map? Explain.\n←The standard error map is related to the variance of the residual time series, after\nlinear fitting. Tscore is computed by dividing the effect size by the standard error of\neffect map. So you want these values to be as small as possible, i.e. low variance in\nthe residual signal, indicating either low noise or tight fit. For optimal detection,\nwe'd like this map to be essentially near zero in our regions of interest.\n←Now the orbits have essentially a high variance in the residual signal. For one,\npeople more their eyes during an fMRI experiment! Second, the orbit is fluid filled,\nand thus is not as rigid as tissue. The fluid is more prone to slosh around (even\nslightly), from thermal motion, physiological motion, and even scanner vibration.\nThis will also increase variance of the signal.\n5.List three ways to increase activation detection sensitivity in fMRI and elaborate on why\nthe methods would work. Answers can be from an experimental design, acquisition, or\ndata analysis pointofview.\n←So many ways!!!\n←Here's a list of a few:\n1)More trials\n2)Longer blocks\n3)Higher field strengths\n4)Multichannel imaging coils\n5)Restrict head motion\n\n6)Monitor respiratory and cardiac signal to use as regressors\n7)Gate to cardiac signal\n8)Smooth data\n9)Temporally filter data to remove autocorrelation\n10)Design experiments s.t. design vectors are orthogonal to drift vectors\n11)Use FIR analysis if HRF is not well known\n12)Use modelfree analysis if there is no prior info about expected signals\n13)Create tasks that better isolates cognitive area of interest\n14)Choose better TE to optimize BOLD contrast"

These terms are quite colinear; if you model in two steps,\nyou'll really miss activation.... Try it!\n←\n4.Run the Linear Modeling Action once more. After entering the design matrix, and specify\ning the contrasts, click on the \"Ouputs\" tab. Unclick log(p) and choose \"Standard error for\neffect\" check boxes. Change the \"Treshold\" level to zero. Click \"Run\". The standard error\nfor effect window should popup.\na.Choose the standard error window; move from the inferior to superior (lower to\nhigher) slices of the brain using the mouse pointer or the scrollwheel. Notice that\nthe orbits (eyes) are considerably brighter (i.e. positive) than most of the brain tissue.\nWhy would this be the case?\nb.Qualitatively, what is the standard error map telling you? For optimal detection,\nwhat would we like to see in this map? Explain.\n←The standard error map is related to the variance of the residual time series, after\nlinear fitting. Tscore is computed by dividing the effect size by the standard error of\neffect map. So you want these values to be as small as possible, i.e. low variance in\nthe residual signal, indicating either low noise or tight fit. For optimal detection,\nwe'd like this map to be essentially near zero in our regions of interest.\n←Now the orbits have essentially a high variance in the residual signal. For one,\npeople more their eyes during an fMRI experiment! Second, the orbit is fluid filled,\nand thus is not as rigid as tissue. The fluid is more prone to slosh around (even\nslightly), from thermal motion, physiological motion, and even scanner vibration.\nThis will also increase variance of the signal.\n5.List three ways to increase activation detection sensitivity in fMRI and elaborate on why\nthe methods would work. Answers can be from an experimental design, acquisition, or\ndata analysis pointofview.\n←So many ways!!!\n←Here's a list of a few:\n1)More trials\n2)Longer blocks\n3)Higher field strengths\n4)Multichannel imaging coils\n5)Restrict head motion\n\n6)Monitor respiratory and cardiac signal to use as regressors\n7)Gate to cardiac signal\n8)Smooth data\n9)Temporally filter data to remove autocorrelation\n10)Design experiments s.t. design vectors are orthogonal to drift vectors\n11)Use FIR analysis if HRF is not well known\n12)Use modelfree analysis if there is no prior info about expected signals\n13)Create tasks that better isolates cognitive area of interest\n14)Choose better TE to optimize BOLD contrast"

Take a look at the -log(p) map you generated in exercise 4. Voxels whose time\ncourse match the model with statistical significance are non-zero (i.e. either yellow\nor blue, not green).

Do these regions appear to be in the right places based on how the visual fields\nmap to the visual cortex? Explain.\nb. One of these regions is yellow (I.e. positive), and one is blue (i.e. negative). Why\nis this the case? Does the negative patch indicate a region of deactivation as\nopposed to activation?\nc. There are also blue and yellow patches in other areas of the brain. Command-\nclick on some of these voxels to see the corresponding time-course and model fit\nin the original data window.

False Discovery Rate\n- p.\n\nA Hypothetical Hypothesis Test\nConsider a hypothesis test for which you obtain the\nt-statistic\nT = 4.62,\nwith 50 degrees of freedom. The corresponding p-value is\n1 -Pr(-4.62 ≤T50 ≤4.62) = 0.000027.\nIs this necessarily cause for celebration?\n- p.\n\nThe Rest of the Story . . .\nThe t-statistic on the previous slide was obtained by\nchoosing the maximum of 64 × 64 × 16 = 65, 536 random\ndraws from the null distribution of the test statistic (i.e.,\nthe T50 distribution).\nSo one might typically expect to see a t-statistic this large\nor larger in a typical fMRI volume, even if what you're\nimaging is a bottle of water.\nWe need to adjust p-values for the number of tests\nperformed, a process which statisticians call adjusting for\nmultiple comparisons.\n- p.\n\nAn Illustrative Example (Model)\nIn order to illustrate many of the basic ideas, it is sufficient\nto consider an example of confidence intervals (or\nhypothesis tests) on just two parameters.\nConsider the simple linear regression model\nyi = δ + β(xi -x ) + ei,\nwhere xi = 0, 10, 20, . . . , 100, δ = 0, β = 1, and the\nei ∼N (0, 102).\n(Aside: Note that the vectors [1, 1, . . . , 1]T and\n[x1 -x, x\n\n2 -x, . . . , x\n\nn -x ]T are orthogonal.)\n- p.\n\nIllustrative Example (Hypothesis)\nWe are interested in testing, at the α = 0.05 level, the null\nhypothesis\nH0 : δ = 0 and β = 1,\nagainst the alternative\nH1 : δ = 0 or β = 1,\nA joint 95% confidence region for (δ, β) would provide a\ncritical region for this test.\n- p.\n\nConfidence Region\nIndividual 95% Confidence Intervals:\nIndepdent Parameter Estimates\n-5\nIntercept\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\nSlope\n- p.\n\nComments\nThe box formed by the two individual confidence intervals\nis considerably smaller than the actual bivariate\nconfidence region.\nEach confidence interval for a parameter has confidence\nlevel 0.95, so the region formed by the intersection of\nthese intervals has confidence 0.952 = 0.9025 < 0.95.\n- p.\n\nComments (Cont'd)\nOver repeated future data, the probability that either\nparameter falls in it's interval is 1 -α∗ = 0.95. Since the\nmodel has been set up so the the estimates (δ,ˆ βˆ) are\nindependent, the actual probability of rejecting H0 for the\npair of confidence intervals\nα =\nPr( T1\nt1 or T2\nt2) =\n|\n| ≥\n|\n| ≥\n1 -(1 -α∗)2 = 1 -(1 -0.05)2 = 0.0975.\n- p. 1\n\nComments (Cont'd)\nWorking backwards, if we choose α∗ to be\nα∗ = 1 -\n√\n1 -α ≈α/2,\nthen we will achieve our goal of an overall significance\nlevel of α.\nThis is approach achieves exactly the desired\nsignificance if the test statistics are independent, but is\nconservative if the test statistics are dependent.\n- p. 1\n\nBonferroni Intervals with 95% Confidence Ellipse\nIndividual 97.47% Confidence Intervals\nWith 95% Joint Confidence Ellipse\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\nSlope\n-5\nIntercept\n- p. 1\n\nBonferroni Correction\nThe Setup: We have k independent test statistics\nT1, . . . , Tk, corresponding to parameters β1, . . . , βk,\nrespectively.\nFor each test statistic, we reject the null hypothesis\nHi : βi = 0 when Ti\nti, for constants t1, . . . , tk.\n|\n| ≥\nWe would like to calculate the probability of rejecting the\nnull hypothesis\nH0 : β1 = β2 = . . . = βk = 0\nagainst the alternative that H0 is not true.\n- p. 1\n\nY\nBonferroni Correction (Cont'd)\nThis probability of rejecting H0 is\nα =\nP0( T1\nt1 or T2\nt2 or . . . Tk\ntk)\n|\n| ≥\n|\n| ≥\n|\n| ≥\nk\n=\n1 -\nPr(|Ti| ≤ti) = 1 -(1 -α∗)k .\ni=1\nHence, we choose\nα∗ = 1 -(1 -α)(1/k) ≈1 -(1 -α/k) = α/k.\n- p. 1\n\nExample Revisited: Alternative Parameterization\nNext we see what happens in our simple linear regression\nexample if we don't subtract of the mean of the xs:\nyi = δ + βxi + ei,\nwhere xi = 0, 10, 20, . . . , 100, δ = 0, β = 1, and the\nei ∼N (0, 102). To relate this to the previous\nparameterization, note that\nδ = δ -x.\n(Aside: Note that the vectors [1, 1, . . . , 1]T and\n[x1, x2, . . . , xn]T not orthogonal! Consequently, the t-tests\nfor δ and β will not be independent.)\n- p. 1\n\nAlternative Parametrization (Cont'd)\nWe are interested in testing the null hypothesis\nH0 : δ = -x and β = 1,\nagainst the alternative\nH1 : δ =\n-x or β =\n1,\nat the 0.05 significance level.\nA joint 95% confidence region for ( δ, β) would provide a\ncritical region for this test.\n- p. 1\n\nConfidence Region for a

Activation Clusters\nIn addition to requiring that p values be below a threshold,\none can impose as an additional requirement that there\nbe a minimum number of voxels clustered at any \"active\"\nlocation.\nThere are obviously many ways to pair critical p-values\nwith minimum cluster sizes.\nThere is a stand-alone C program, AlphaSim that can\ndetermine cluster significance levels by simulation.\nAlphaSim is part of the AFNI distribution (Bob Cox, NIH,\nafni.nimh.nih.gov)\n- p. 1\n\nExample AlphaSim Command Line\nA typical run of AlphaSim:\nAlphaSim -nx 46 -ny 55 -nz 46 \\\n-dx

2\n\nInterpretation of AlphaSim Results\nMaximum active clusters of 42 or more below threshold\np = 0.05 occur about 5% of the time under the null\nhypothesis of no activation.\nNote the following:\nFor a higher p-value threshold, the minimum\nsignificant cluster size will be larger.\nThis approach accounts for spatial correlation induced\nby smoothing, but not for and spatial correlation\npresent in the unsmoothed data.\n- p. 2\n\nSummary: Bonferroni\nFor an overall test at the α significance level, select\nindividual voxels among N total as active if p ≤α/N.\nNot a bad approximation if voxels are nearly independent.\nCan be very conservative if there is considerable spatial\ncorrelation among voxels.\nUsing both a p-value threshold and a minimum cluster\nsize via AlphaSim is one way to partially overcome this\nconservatism.\n- p. 2\n\nGaussian Random Field\nA Gaussian random field is a stationary Gaussian\nstochastic process, usually in 2 or 3 dimensions.\nThe one-dimensional case of GRF is Brownian motion\n(formally, a Weiner process).\nUnsmoothed BOLD activation is not well approximated as\na GRF, so spatial smoothing is generally done if one is to\nuse GRF theory.\nSmoothing is averaging, and averages of (almost)\narbitrary random variables are approximately Gaussian.\nThis is the essence of the Central Limit Theorem.\n- p. 2\n\nEuler Characteristic\nIf one thresholds a continuous GRF, the the Euler\nCharacteristic is\nEC = (# Blobs) -(# Holes),\nif the threshold is sufficiently high, then this will\nessentially become the (# Blobs).\nIf the threshold is higher still, then the EC will likely be\nzero or 1.\nIf we threshold high enough, then we might be able to\nassume, at an appropriate significance level, that all

approximately.\nIn order to meet this requirement, we must do fairly hefty\nspatial smoothing (i.e., precoloring).\nThis has the obvious disadvantage of blurring together\nbrain structures with different functions, particularly if the\nsmoothing is not done on the cortical surface.\nCompare with AlphaSim, another way for accounting for\nspatial correlation due to smoothing.\n- p. 3\n\nFalse Discovery Rate\nThe Bonferroni and GRF approaches ensure that the\nprobability of incorrectly declaring any voxel active is\nsmall. If any voxels \"survive,\" one can reasonably expect\nthat each one is truly active.\nAn alternative approach is to keep the proportion of\nvoxels incorrectly declared active small. Among those\nvoxels declared active, a predetermined proportion (e.g.,\n0.05), on average, will be declared active in error (\"false\ndiscoveries\").\n- p. 3\n\nImplementing FDR\nOrder the N p-values from smallest to largest:\np(1) ≤p(2) ≤· · · ≤ p(N).\nDeclare as active voxels corresponding to ordered\np-values for which\np(i) ≤qci/N,\nwhere q is the selected FDR.\nThe choice of c depends on the assumed correlation\nstructure for the test statistics.\n- p. 3\n\nValues for c\nTwo choices for c have been suggested in the literature\nFor independent tests, or tests based on data for which\nthe noise is Gaussian with non-negative correlation\nacross voxels, use c = 1.\nFor arbitrary correlation structure in the noise, use\nc = 1/(log(N) + γ), where γ = . 0.577 is Euler's constant.\n- p. 3\n\nA Simulated Example\nNumber of Voxels:\nN = 64 × 64 × 16 = 65, 536\nNumber of Active Voxels:\nN1 = 0.02N = 1, 335\n\"Inactive\" statistics independently distributed t50.\n\"Active\" statistics independently distributed noncentral-t,\nt50(δ), where δ = 3.5.\n- p. 3\n\nDensities for Active and Inactive Voxel Statistics\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nProbability Density\nNull\nActive\n-6\n-4\n-2\nTest Statistic\n- p. 3\n\nHistogram of the Voxel Statistics\nHistogram of 64x64x16 =65536 Statistics\nFrequency\n-4\n-2\nTest Statistic\n- p. 3\n\nGraphical Illustration of Results\nInactive Voxels\nActive Voxels\nOrdered p-Values\n0.0000\n0.0005\n0.0010\n0.0015\nOrdered p-Values\n0.000\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.010\n0.005\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\n0.000\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.010\n0.012\ni/n\ni/n\n- p. 3\n\nSimulation Results\n.\nFDR = 35/549 = 0.064, c = 1:\n(Solid line in preceeding figure)\nDiscovered\nYes\nNo\nCorrect 514 64,166\nError\nTotal\n549 64,987\n- p. 3\n\nSimulation Results\n.\nFDR = 1/123 = 0.008, c = 1/(log(N) + γ):\n(Broken line in preceeding figure)\nDiscovered\nYes\nNo\nCorrect 122 64,200\nError\nTotal\n123 65,413\n- p. 4\n\nSimulation Results\nBonferroni (FDR = 0), p = .05/N = 7.6 × 10-7\n(Not shown in preceeding figure)\nDiscovered\nYes\nNo\nCorrect\n64,201\nError\nTotal\n65,492\n- p. 4\n\nSummary: False Discovery Rate\nCan be more sensitive at detecting true activation than\nBonferroni without requiring the heavy spatial smoothing\nof GRF theory.\nBut a change in philosophy is required: instead of making\nthe likelihood of any voxel being falsely declared active\nsmall, one is willing to accept that a small proportion of\nvoxels will likely be false discoveries, and instead attempt\nto control the size of this proportion.\n- p. 4\n\nII.

Conjunction Analysis\n- p. 5\n\nGroup Analyses\nWe next consider approaches to data analyses which\ninvolve more than one subject.\nThe first difficulty that one has to address in these\nsituations is warping each subjects data onto a common\ntemplate, such as Talaraich coordinates.\nThis process can easily introduce and difficulties and\ndistortions of its own, but these are beyond the scope of\nthe present discussion.\n- p. 5\n\nFixed Effects Analyses\nIt is conceivable that one might want to make inference\nfor only the subjects at hand, without any desire to\nextrapolate to a larger population.\nThis might be the case for clinical applications of fMRI, for\nexample, where the objective is to understand the\nsubjects - patients - who are being studied or treated.\nFixed effects models should be used in such cases.\nBut since fMRI is presently a research tool, fixed effects\nanalyses are usually less appropriate than random effects\nanalyses, in which one is concerned with inferences valid\nfor a population, or equivalently, for the \"next\" subject\nwhich one might obtain.\n- p. 5\n\nFixed vs. Random Effects\nAssume that several machines are used in a production\nenvironment. To fix ideas, let's say these machines are\nfor DNA sequencing.\nIf I have several of these machines in my lab, I would\npresumably be interested in quantifying the relative\nperformance of each of them. Fixed effects models would\nbe appropriate.\nOn the other hand, if I owned the company that makes\nthe machines, then I'd want to characterize the\nperformance of any one of the machines, conceptually\ndrawn at random. The machines would then constitute a\npopulation, and I'd use random effects analyses.\n- p. 5\n\nThe Random-Effects Idea\nA contrast at any given voxel is regarded as a sum of\nthree components:\n1. The true (but unknown) contrast\n2. A random shift from the truth which depends only on\nthe subject.\n3. A second random shift from the truth due to\nmeasurement uncertainty within a subject.\nIn the limit of many subjects, (2) can be made arbitrarily\nsmall; in the limit of long scans, (3) can be made\narbitrarily small (except perhaps for a measurement bias).\n- p. 5\n\nThe Random-Effects Idea: Schematic\nTrue Contrast\nBetween-Subjects\nWithin-Subj.\nPopulation\nEstimated Contrast\n-\nWithin-Subject\nPopulation of\nSubj.

(Degrees of freedom ≈number of subjects.)\n- p. 6\n\n\"Standard\" Two-Stage Approach for Random Effects\nStage 1: Obtain the a map of effects for each subject.\nStage 2: Use these effect maps as \"data\" in the second\nstage of the analysis.\nForm the t-statistic for an overall test of significance of the\neffect or contrast.\nNote that these maps enter into the second stage on\n\"equal footing\".\n- p. 6\n\nCritique of Usual Two-Stage Approach\nThe usual two-stage approach to multi-subject analyses\ntreats the contrast estimate maps from each subject as\ngiven data, without consideration of the uncertainty in\nthese values, which may be considerable and which may\ndiffer from subject to subject.\nA better approach is two summarize a contrast of interest\nby two maps: a contrast estimate map, and a\ncorresponding standard error map.

This\nis called sensitization.\n- p. 8\n\nA Regression Model\nFor \"representative\" voxels in each subject:\nlog(yt)\n=\nβ0 + βhalf + βtype +\nβhalf × βtype + ot\nwhere βtype is a 3-level factor for face type (Angry,\nNeutral, Fixation); βhalf (levels 1 and 2) compares the\nfirst and second half of the experiment, and ot is (for\nsimplicity) here modeled as white noise.\n- p. 8\n\nHabituation/Sensitiziation Contrast\nFor models of log of the data, contrasts become\ndimensionless ratios.

(Note\nthe degrees of freedom of the t-statistics in our example:\nn(s -1) for FE; s -1 for RE. So the t-distribution is more\ndiffuse, and the standard error has the extra σb\n2/s term.)\n- p. 8\n\nNot Enough Subjects (Cont'd)\nIt's important to realize that the large standard errors for\nRE analyses with few subjects is usually not a fault of the\nmetholdogy. Rather, one is incorporating σ b in the\nstandard errors of the estimates, and this is quantity\nwhich can't be well estimated except under two\nconditions:\nYou have lots of subjects, and so σ2 /s is reasonably\nb\nsmall, and your t-test for effect significance has\nadequate degrees of freedom.\nYou regularize the estimate of σˆ2\nb by including\ninformation which isn't in the data. This can be done\nexplicitly, via a prior distributions and a Bayesian\nanalysis, or implicitly, as in Worsley (2002).\n- p. 9\n\nTypicality\nFriston, Holmes and Worsley (NeuroImage, 1-5, 1999)\nintroduce the concepts of typicality and conjunction\nanalysis as a way to make inference with respect to a\npopulation in a fixed-effects context.\nIf one has a small sample of subjects, and a certain\nfeature is observed in several of these subjects (adjusting\nfor multiple comparisons), then one can say, qualitatively,\nthat this feature is \"typical,\" and thus likely to be present in\na population.\nThis is to be contrasted from quantitative assessment of\nwhat the \"average\" effect is in a randomly selected\nsubject from a population.\n- p. 9\n\nConjunction Analysis\nIn conjunction analysis, one attempts to find what\nactivation is statistically significantly in all (or, perhaps,\nmost) subjects.\nThis feature can then be thought of as typical, i.e., more\nlikely than not to be present in the population from which\nthe subjects are drawn.\n- p. 9\n\nIV. Model Validation\nThe GLM is a very powerful tool, but like any modeling\ntool, it is only good to the extent that the modeling\nassumptions are valid.\nIf assumptions are grossly violated, then inferences can\nbe seriously misleading.\n- p. 9\n\nLinear Model (GLM) Assumptions\nThe assumptions underlying the model include:\nThe form of the model for the mean.\nThe temporal correlation structure, and equal-variance\nassumptions.\nGaussian errors.\nSeparation of signal from noise (e.g., What part of the\ntrend in a time course is a \"nuisance effect\" to be\nfiltered out, and what part of it is slowly varying\nsignal?)\n- p. 9\n\nThe Form of the Model\nIf your X matrix does not appropriately model the factors\ncontributing to mean activation, then your estimates can\nbe seriously biased.\nThis bias can, in principle, be detected by looking at the\nresiduals.\nThink of the example of a straight line fit to data for which\na parabola would be much better.\nHow would the residuals (deviations from the fit) tell you\nthat your model is inappropriate?\n- p. 9\n\nError Variance Assumptions\nInappropriate modeling of temporal correlation can give\nyou a biased estimate of the uncertainty in effects, and\ngrossly incorrect estimates of degrees of freedom for\nvoxel t- or F -statistics.\nIn principle, one can test this by looking to see if the\nresiduals at each time course are (at least approximately)\nwhite noise.\n- p. 9\n\nError Variance Assumptions (Cont'd)\nHow does the temporal autocorrelation vary from voxel to\nvoxel? Is it adequate to use the same model for each\nvoxel?\nAssuming equal within-voxel variances when these\nvariances differ considerably is also something that one\nmight want to look out for, though checking the correlation\nestimates is probably more important.\n- p. 9\n\nGaussian Errors\nWhen doing inference, we assume that the noise in our\ndata follows Gaussian distributions.\n(This assumption is necessary for determining standard\nerrors of estimates; it is not required for the estimates\nthemselves.)\nFixed effects analysis are not very sensitive to violation of\nthis assumption. The central limit theorem implies that\naverages tend to be Gaussian in many situations, and\ncoefficient estimates are essentially weighted averages.\nStandardized contrasts will generally be approximately\nt-distributed (Central Limit Theorem; if standard errors\nand degrees of freedom are appropriately estimated).\n- p. 9\n\nGaussian Errors (Cont'd)\nThis robustness, unfortunately, does not extend to\nrandom effects. Estimates of variances between subjects,\nfor example, will likely be sensitive to to the assumption of\nGaussianity. That being said, Gaussian random-effects\nmodels are very widely used, because there are not good\nalternatives.\n- p. 9\n\nSeparation of Signal from Noise\nA necessary step in any fMRI analysis is to remove\nnuisance effects from the data.\nUsually these results are low-frequency trends, and they\nare removed either by high-pass filtering, or by explicit\nmodeling via covariates in the GLM.\nAlways keep in mind that if your have signal which looks\nlike the trend being removed, then you might be \"throwing\nthe baby out with the bathwater.\"\nOne example might be a nuisance physiological effect,\nwhich you'd like to model and remove. If this effect is, at\nleast in part, associated with an experimental stimulus,\nthen you could be discarding important signal with the\nnoise.\nnoise.\n- p. 10\n\nModel Selection\nIn any course in regression analysis, one learns how to\nchoose a \"best\" model from within a family of interesting\ncandidate models.\nPart of this approach involves examining candidate\nmodels for goodness-of-fit, mostly be examining residuals\nas discussed earlier.\nAnother part of this approach is model comparison, which\ninvolves fitting a \"large\" model, with perhaps too many\nparameters, and then comparing this fit to a \"smaller\"\nmodel in which some of these parameters are\nconstrained, either to equal zero, or else perhaps to equal\neach other.\n- p. 10\n\nModel Selection (Cont'd)\nModel comparison thus reduces to hypothesis testing, in\nthe simplest textbook situations, to F -tests.\nThis approach can be applied to fMRI, although instead\nof a single F -test, we will have F maps and associated\np-value maps to interpret.\nMore general model comparison tool compare the\nreduction in residual sum of squares between nested\nmodels, penalizing for complexity due to adding\nparameters. Two such criteria are AIC and BIC (Akaike\nInformation Criterion; Bayesian Information Criterion).\n- p. 10\n\nModel Validation: SPMd Toolbox\nLuo and Nichols (2002). \"Diagnosis and Exploration of\nMassively Univariate Datasets,\" Technical Report, U.\nMich Dept. of Biostatistics.

See also Bullmore et al., NeuroImage, 4,\n16-33, 1996, for an applied article which clearly\npresents the basic methodological ideas.\n- p. 1\n\nHow PCA in fMRI is Different\nUsual PCA scenario: Rows of Xn×p are a sample of\nsize n of a p-variate Gaussian.\nIn fMRI, Xn×p is a matrix of time × space, hence a\nsample of size one from a np-dimensional Gaussian.\n(Actually, one can also cast the X matrix for \"typical\"\nnon-fMRI PCAs in this form, but the covariance matrix\nwill be block diagonal with the p × p covariance matrix of\nthe column variables repeated n times on the diagonal,\nbecause of the independent cases).\n- p. 1\n\nCovariance Matrices\nXT X, p × p, is the (singular) spatial covariance matrix\nXXT , n\nn, is the temporal covariance matrix\n×\nDuality: We can switch the roles of n and p (that is, work\nwith XT in the role of X, in which case the voxels are\nregarded as \"cases\" and time points as \"variables\".)\n- p. 1\n\nEigenvalues and Eigenvectors\nEigenvalues of XXT (temporal), and (nonzero)\neigenvalues XT X (spatial):\nλ1 > λ2 > λ3 > . . . > λn\nEigenvectors {wk} (spatial, p × 1), and {uk} (temporal,\nn × 1):\nXT Xwk =\nλkwk\nXXT uk =\nλkuk\n- p. 1\n\nX\nX\nP\nDecomposition of Variance\nLet σx\ni be the variance of xi, the ith row of X, i.e., the\nvariance of image at the ith time point. Then\nn\nn\nσx\ni =\nλi = tr (XXT )\ni=1\ni=1\nSo the variance is preserved by the PCA.\nHence, the normalized eigenvalues\nλk\nτk ≡\nλi\ni\ncan be interpreted as the proportion of variance\nattributable to the kth PCA.\n- p. 2\n\nSpatial-Temporal Duality\nThe products {Xwk} yields the scores (PCs) for a\ndecomposition in terms of the loadings {wk\nT };\nThe products {XT uk} Yoda's the scores for a\ndecomposition in terms of the loadings {uk}.\nSince\nuk = Xwk/√λk,\nand wk = XT uk/√λk\n- p. 2\n\nSpatial-Temporal Duality, Continued\nThus the loadings of the eigenimages of the spatial\ncovariance matrix XT X are proportional to the scores\nfor the dual analysis with time points as variables, and\nvice versa.\nSince n << p, it is computationally far more efficient to\ncompute the eigenvectors of the n\nn matrix XXT . We\n×\ncan then use the duality to easily get the p-dimensional\neigenvectors of XT X.\n- p. 2\n\nX\nDecomposition of X\nFinally, we can use the SVD (interpreted via PCA) to\nexpress the space-time matrix X as a sum of p n\nn\n×\nrank-one matrices, each determined by a spatial\neigenimage wi and a temporal eigenvector ui, weighted\nby decreasing eigenvalues λi:\nn\nT\nX =\n√\nλiuiwi\ni=1\nEach term is the outer product of an eigenimage with a\nunivariate timecourse. One can hope that the first few\neigenimages are interpretable, and that they explain\nmost of the variability in X.\n- p. 2\n\nSchematic of Decomposition\n(Truncating the sum at q ≤n terms provides the closest\nleast-squares rank-q approximation to X.)\n- p. 2\n\nX\nStatistical Inference\nFor the first time, we now use the Gaussian assumption\nof our data model, and not just the covariance matrices.\nWe distinguish between estimates (e.g., λˆk) and their\ncorresponding population values.\nVar (λˆk) ≈2λ2/(p -1)\nk\nVar (ˆuk) ≈\nλk\nλj\n2 ukuk\nT\np -1\nj = 1\n(λk -λj )\nj = k\nAsymptotically valid for large n and p. Substitute\nestimates for population values.\nVar ( ˆwk) is of the same form as above, with obvious\nchanges.\n- p. 2\n\nHow Many PCs are different from noise?\nThere is an extensive literature on this topic.\nAndersen et al. reference W.G. Mallows, Latent vectors\nof random symmetric matrices, Biometrika, 48,\n133-149, 1960.\nIn practice, one often empirically keeps a \"few\"\neigenimages, such that a reasonably large proportion of\nthe variance is explained, and for which the networks\nindicated by the images have reasonable\ninterpretations.\nReplication over subjects is more convincing than any\nformal statistical test, since the tests are asymptotically\nvalid, and even then only when the Gaussian\nassumption is satisfied.\n- p. 2\n\nHow Many PCs: Common Approaches\nPlot the eigenvalues in decreasing order (a scree plot,\nand look for a break (\"knee\"), with the eigenvalues to\nthe right of the knee being very small.\nRetain eigenvalues greater than the average. (Recall\nthat the eigenvalues are the variances of the PCs).\nFormally test for the smallest eigenvalue equal to zero,\nthen the last two eigenvalues equal to zero, etc., until\nthe null hypothesis is rejected. This tends to retain more\ncomponents than other approaches, in part because\nthe tests are not independent.\n- p. 2\n\nWhy do PCA?\nThe first few components often account for most of the\nvariability. We can keep only the components with\n\"large\" variances, that is, PCA can be used for\ndimension reduction.\nThe loadings for at least some of the PCs might be\ninterpretable, (e.g., first PC above might correspond\nroughly to the size of the turtle shell, or the first few\neigenimages might correspond to neural networks\nwhich seem sensible given the experiment).\n- p. 2\n\nIndependent Components Analysis (ICA)\nCorrelation vs. Independence\nThe blind-source separation problem\nA simple example with two components\nThe importance of NonGausianity\nThe central limit theorem\nKurtosis\nNegentropy\nPreprocessing\nProbabilistic ICA\nComparison with PCA\n- p. 2\n\nP\nCorrelation\nIf one plots observations of two random variables in a\n2D scatterplot, then correlation measures the extent to\nwhich these points fall along a straight line.\nIf X and Y are random variables, with expected values\nE(X) and E(Y ), then the correlation ρ is defined as\nE[(X -E(X))(Y -E(Y ))]\nρ = p\np\nE(X -E(X))2\nE(Y -E(Y ))2\nThe sample form of this equation is\ni (xi -x )(yi -y )\nr = pP\npP\ni(xi -x )2\ni(yi -y )2\nThe numerator is the covariance, and the denominator\nis the product of standard deviations.\n- p. 3\n\nUncorrelated Gaussians are Independent\nY\n-3\n-2\n-1\nSample of 1000 from\nUncorrelated Gaussians\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\nX\n- p. 3\n\nUncorrelated Non-Gaussians can be Dependent\n145 Bivariate Gaussians\nSelected from Previous Sample\nY1\n-3\n-2\n-1\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\nX1\n- p. 3\n\nICA: Blind Source Separation\nImagine that there are n time-varying sources si(t).\nWe cannot directly observe the si; instead we observe\nlinear combinations\nxi(t) = ai1s1(t) + ai2s2(t) + . . . + ainsn(t),\nor, in matrix form\nX = AS\n(Note, by the way, that there is no error term above.)\nIf the si(t) are independent at each t, then one can, in\nprinciple, determine the si uniquely up to a multiplicative\nconstant.\n- p. 3\n\n\"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\nExample: Hyv arinen and Oja (2000)\nTwo independent signals uniformly distributed on\n[-\n√\n3,\n√\n3]:\nsi ∼U(-\n√\n3,\n√\n3),\nfor i = 1, 2.\nWe observe the following pair of dependent random\nvariables, which is a linear mixture of the si:\nx1\ns1\n=\nx2\ns2\n- p. 3\n\nS_2\n-2\n-1\nExample: Latent Uniform Sources\nExample: Independent Uniform Sources\n-2\n-1\nS_1\n- p. 3\n\nX2\n-2\n-1\nExample: Observed Mixture\nMixture of Uniform Sources\n-4\n-2\nX1\n- p. 3\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem\nAverages of random variables tend to be more\nGaussian then the averaged components\nRoll of a fair Die\nProb.\nProb.\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nCount\nAverage of five Rolls of a fair Die\nCount\n- p. 3\n\nThe Basic Idea of ICA\nA linear combination of the xis is necessarily also a\nlinear combination of the sis:\ny = w T x = w T (As) ≡z T s\nWe want to find a vector z for which y is as\nnon-Gaussian as possible.\nThere are 2n local solutions, equal to ±si(t), for\ni = 1, . . . , n.\nIf two or more of the si are Gaussian, then the sources\ncannot be found, since any linear combination of\nGaussians is also Gaussian.\n- p. 3\n\nX\nNonGaussianity Criteria: Kurtosis\nKurtosis is the fourth central moment. The fourth\nmoment is equal to 3 for Gaussians, leas than 3 for\ndensities which peak near the center (leptokurtic,\nsub-Gaussian), and greater than 3 for densities flat near\nthe center (platykurtic, super-Gaussian).\nAssume x and y have variance 1. Kurtosis is\nκ(x) =\n(xi -x )4 -3\ni\nKurtosis is additive:\nκ(c1x + c2y) = c1\n4κ(x) + c2\n4κ(y)\nKurtosis is computationally simple, but highly sensitive\nto outliers.\n- p. 3\n\nNonGaussianity Criteria: Negentropy\nEntropy, H(·), measures the amount of information in a\nrandom variable; the more \"random\" (i.e.,\nunpredictable), the higher the entropy:\nH(Y )\nPr(Y = ai) log[Pr(Y = ai)],\n≡-\nX\ni\nsummed (or integrated) over all values in the support of\nY .\nAmong all random variables with the same variance,\nthe Gaussian has the highest entropy.\nLet Z be Gaussian, and Y any other random variable\nwith the same variance as Z. Negentropy is defined as\nfollows\nJ(Y ) ≡H(Z) -H(Y )\nNegentropy is thus always non-negative.\n- p. 4\n\nPreprocessing\nSince ICA does not make use of covariances, it makes\nsense computationally to first center and pre-whiten the\ndata.\nIf this is done, then the mixing matrix A (analogous to\nthe \"eigentimecourses\" in PCA) will be orthogonal.\nThus, one might consider doing PCA first, then\nwhitening (and thus discarding the covariance\ninformation on which PCA is based), and following with\nICA.\n- p. 4\n\nProbabilistic ICA (MELODIC)\nIn order to avoid overfitting, and also to be able to\nprobabilistically rank, threshold, and select ICs, we need\nto extend the IC model to include noise.\nOne approach is implemented in the FSL package\nMELODIC (Beckmann and Smith)\nThe MELODIC model (i indexes voxels):\nxi = Asi + μ + ηi\nxi is p × 1, A is p × q, where q < p, μ is the mean,\nηi ∼N (0, σ2Σi).\nApproximate negentropy is used to find the ICs\nA Gaussian mixture model is used to detect activation\nA Baysian approach to assign probabilities to\n- p. 4\ncomponents.\n\nICA vs PCA\nPCA and ICA are formally very similar: both produce a\nsequence of images and associated timecourses.\nPCA was developed for multivariate Gaussian data, for\nwhich uncorrelatedness implies independence.\nThere is a natural ordering of principal components,\nbased on the eigenvalues of the covariance or correlation\nmatrix.\nPCA is often used to hopefully reduce the dimensionality\nof the problem, but replacing a high-dimensional dataset\nwith a smaller number of orthogonal principal\ncomponents.\n- p. 4\n\nICA vs PCA (Continued)\nICA fails for Gaussian data. It is an attempt to find\nindependent non-Gaussian components. (In practice,\none first centers and whitens the data, so that the data\nare uncorrelated from the beginning.)\nThere is no natural ordering of independent\ncomponents, so no natural way to reduce\ndimensionality.\nThe PCA algorithm is essentially unique, based on the\nsingular value decomposition.\nICA is algorithm-dependent. And even repeated runs\nusing the same algorithm can give different answers,\nsince there are random choices made in the\noptimization algorithm (e.g., random starting vectors).\n- p. 4\n\nGranger Causality\nPrototype Problem: Time series for two nodes X and Y in\na network, want to measure directed association\nX\nY .\n⇒\nIdea:\nFit model.

Human Subjects Issues Specific to Functional MRI\nFunctional neuroimaging poses some significant risks. Entry into the magnet environment alone\nis one of those risks. Experiments involving injection of drugs or contrast agents, invasive physiological\nmonitoring, emotionally stressful experimental paradigms, and or use of clinical populations each add\nadditional risks. All aspects of a research career in functional neuroimaging require competence in the\narea of human subjects protections including clear knowledge of the foreseeable risks, obtaining IRB\napproval to conduct a study, and informed consent from subjects.\n\nA. Health Effects of MRI Studies\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (including spectroscopy, conventional, and fast imaging techniques)\nfor medical procedures is associated with acceptable and well-controlled risks. However, technological\nadvances in MRI (higher static fields, faster gradients, stronger RF transmitters) have occurred rapidly\nand many questions regarding the safety of these developments remain unanswered. The standard\nreference on MR safety is the book by Shellock cited in the references.\n\nInformal market research studies indicate that more than 150 million diagnostic MRI examinations\nwere performed worldwide between the onset of clinical MRI in the early 1980s and the end of 1999;\nthe vast majority of these were conducted without any sign of patient injury. MRI related deaths and\ninjuries are attributable to the high field environment required for scanning, which can result in\nprojectile accidents (AKA \"missile effect\"). Inadequate screening procedures for metallic objects are\nthe other major factor responsible for subject morbidity and mortality. Examples include the death of a\n6 year old boy in 2003 by the projectile path of a metal oxygen tank, and the deaths of patients with\ncardiac pacemakers who were inadvertently scanned.\n\nConcerns for patient safety have been raised in regard to each of the three distinct fields used in\nMRI; the static B0 fields; the radiofrequency (RF) transmission field, B1 and the time dependent\nmagnetic field gradients.\n\n-\nStatic B0 fields- no established adverse health effects.\nStatic magnetic fields are measured in Gauss (G) or Tesla (T), with 10,000 G being equal to 1 T.\nTo put things in perspective, the earth's magnetic field varies from approximately 0.3 to 0.7 G between\nthe equator and the poles, respectively. A small refrigerator door magnet may be as strong as 150 G to\n250 G. The strengths of the static magnetic fields used in research MR systems for imaging and/or\nspectroscopy range 0.012 T to over 10 T (100,000 G). According to the most recent recommendations\nand guidelines provided by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), clinical MR\nsystems in the US are permitted to function on a routine clinical basis at static magnetic field strengths\nof up to 4.0 T.\n\nExtensive research studies have been conducted in isolated tissues, animals and humans to identify\nill effects of exposure to high magnetic fields. While there have been some positive findings, none of\nthese has been replicated. The work performed to date has yet to prove a single example of a\nscientifically sound and rigorously verified pathological effect of high magnetic fields 2. The absence of\nferromagnetic components in human tissues and the extremely small value of the magnetic susceptibility\nof these tissues are believed to be responsible for the absence of harmful effects of the high magnetic\nfields.\n\nMagnetohydrodynamic effects on most body tissues are sufficiently small as to be physiologically\ninsignificant. One hypothesized exception is the endolymphatic tissues of the inner ear that may be the\nsource of sensations of nausea and vertigo reported by some human subjects in the presence of higher\n\n(e.g. 4 to 7T) static magnetic fields. The comfort of subjects will be enhanced by moving them\nSLOWLY in and out of the magnet and by minimizing their motion while in the magnet.\nNote: magnetohydrodynamic forces can induce distortion in recorded ECG signals. It is important\nto recognize that these distortions do not reflect any change in cardiac conduction; rather they are\nartifacts in the recording.\n\nThe safety aspect of the static field is hard to quantify because there is no clear physical\nphenomena associated with exposure that can be used to establish upper limits for safe subject exposure.\nThe upper limit on the strength of the static magnetic field that can be used for human imaging studies is\nset by technical, regulatory and cost factors. Current research efforts to develop ultra high field imaging\nsystems are of high priority. Future work at these higher fields may establish health effects that have not\nyet been detected.\n\n-\nRF B1 fields- Limiting physiological effect is tissue heating\nA RF pulse (a short burst of an electromagnetic radiation) is used in MRI to \"excite\" tissue protons\nby an exchange of energy. The RF spectrum typically used in MRI covers the same frequencies that are\nused by radio stations (around 100 MHz). Such high frequency oscillations do not elicit peripheral\nnerve stimulation (see next section).\n\nDuring MR procedures, the majority of the RF power transmitted for imaging is transformed into\nheat within the patient's tissue as a result of resistive losses from the induced electric field. This ohmic\nheating of tissue during MR procedures is greatest at the surface or periphery and minimal at the center\nof the body of human subjects.\n\nAbsorption of RF power by the tissue is described in terms of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR),\nwhich is expressed in Watts/kg. In the US, the recommended SAR level for head imaging is 3.2\nWatts/kg. The relative amount of RF radiation that an individual encounters during a MR procedure is\nusually characterized with respect to the whole-body averaged and peak SAR levels (i.e., the SAR\naveraged in one gram of tissue).\n\nThe SAR produced during a MR procedure is a complex function of scanner and body factors.\nScanner factors include the frequency (i.e., determined by the strength of the static magnetic field of the\nMR system, with resonant frequencies producing the greatest effect), the type of RF pulse used (e.g., 90°\nvs. 180° pulse), the repetition time and the type of RF coil used. Body factors include the volume of\ntissue contained within the coil, the configuration of the anatomical region exposed, the orientation of\nthe body to the field vectors, as well as other factors. However, the actual increase in tissue temperature\ncaused by exposure to RF radiation is dependent on the subjects thermoregulatory system (e.g. tissue\nperfusion, etc.). The risk of exposing subjects with compromised thermoregulatory function (e.g. elderly\npatients and patients taking medications that affect thermoregulation, such as calcium-blockers, beta-\nblockers, diuretics, or vasodilators) to MR procedures that require high SARs has not been assessed.\n\nWhen operating a commercially built scanner with coils and pulse sequences provided by the\nmanufacturer, all scanning will be done within safe limits. When developing new coils, pulse sequences\nor in other ways adapting the scanning environment, it is the obligation of the investigator to ensure that\nthe scans will be safe for human subjects. Several of the newer pulse sequences and imaging techniques\nthat have been developed use relatively high levels of RF energy. For example, using fast spin echo\n(FSE) and magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) pulse sequences on high-field-strength MR systems\nmay require levels of RF energy that easily exceed whole body averaged SARs ranging between 4.0 to\n8.0 W/kg (i.e., higher than the level currently recommended by the FDA). The thermogenic effects of\nRF energy deposited by the newest ultra high field imaging systems have yet to be characterized.\n\nIn order to minimize any excessive tissue heating that may occur during exposure to high levels of\nRF energy, use the fan in the scanner during imaging procedures whenever tolerated by the subject.\n\nElectrical Burns\n\nRF fields can cause burns by producing electrical currents in conductive loops. When using\nequipment such as surface coils, ECG or EEG leads, the investigator must be extremely careful not to\nallow the wire or cable to form a conductive loop with itself or with the subject. Coupling of a\ntransmitting coil to a receive coil may also cause severe burns.\n\nSwitched gradient fields- Limiting physiological effect is peripheral nerve stimulation\n\nThe thermal effects that result from gradient switching during MRI have been found to be\nessentially negligible and are not considered clinically significant. Similarly, the stimulation effects on\ncardiac tissue are considered negligible. However, both theory and practice have demonstrated that\ngradient magnetic field switching can induce metallic taste, magnetophosphenes (electromagnetically-\ninduced visual flashes of light), peripheral nerve stimulation, and skeletal muscular contractions.\n\nTo minimize these electrical effects, subjects should be instructed not to clasp their hands (to\navoid creating a conductive loop, thus increasing the likelihood of neural stimulation) and to inform the\noperator if they experience any discomfort or pain so that they can be re-positioned in the magnet.\n\nThe pulsed gradient fields that occur during MRI expose the subject to a time varying magnetic\nfield. According to Faraday's Law of Induction, exposure of any conductive tissue to time-varying\nmagnetic fields will induce an electric field (measured in V/m) in the conductive tissue that is oriented\nperpendicular to the time rate of change of the magnetic field. These effects are markedly greater using\necho planar imaging technology and hardware that requires up to 2.5 gauss/cm maximum amplitudes\nand <300 microsecond rise times.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field will be determined by several factors including the electrical\nresistance in the induced circuit in the tissue(s), the cross sectional area of the tissue, and the rate of\nchange (i.e., changing magnitude versus time) of the gradient magnetic field, itself 3. All induced\nelectric fields will occur during the times that the gradient magnetic field strengths are changing; the\ngreater the magnitude of the rise and fall times, the greater the induced electric field. And, the steeper\nthe rate of rise of the gradient magnetic field strength, the lower the threshold for peripheral nerve\nstimulation. The relations between these factors are linear, with a slope unique to each waveform (e.g.\nsine wave or trapezoid).\n\nNote that there is a greater changing magnetic field over time as one proceeds further away from\nthe center and towards the ends of the gradient coils, where the time rate of change of the gradient\nmagnetic fields is the greatest (AKA maximum magnetic flux). The length of the gradient coils thus\ndetermines the site of peripheral nerve stimulation.\n\nAcoustic Noise\nAnother potentially hazardous effect related to gradient magnetic fields is the acoustic noise\nproduced as current is passed through the gradient coils during image acquisition. For anatomical\nimaging, the noise is mostly of low frequency and has a \"clunking\" sound; for EPI, the noise can be of\nvery high frequency (600-1400 Hz) and sounds like a loud \"beep\". Generally, the stronger gradients\n\nused with higher magnetic fields and with EPI produce more intense noise. Prolonged exposure to this\nnoise will damage the unprotected ear. Even conventional scanning procedures, which are considered to\nproduce noise within the recommended FDA safety guidelines, have been documented to cause\nreversible hearing loss when patients did not wear ear protection.\n\nAll research subjects should wear hearing protection in the form of earplugs or headphones during\nscanning (both are recommended on the 3T). Earplugs must be the right size and properly inserted into\nthe ear canal to obtain their full effect. This requires instruction and practice. It is the responsibility of\nthe researcher to see that the subject is properly fitted with hearing protection. Packing the subject's\nhead with foam cushions further dampens the noise and is recommended in the 3T environment.\n\nAdditional noise in the magnet environment comes from the magnet coolant pump, air handling\nsystem and patient fan. While not dangerous, these other sources of noise can be annoying to subjects\nand can interfere with communication.\n\nB. Safety in the High Field Environment\n1. Screening\nThis is the single most important safety step. No subject with any contraindication to scanning\nshould ever be scanned. All subjects should be thoroughly screened by a trained staff member before\nrecruitment into any imaging study. Preferably before they come to the scanner to avoid wasting\nprecious scan time. Absolute contraindications to scanning include: indwelling ferromagnetic material\n(e.g. foreign object in eye, some surgical implants), pregnancy, seizure disorder, implanted\nbioengineering device (e.g. pacemaker, infusion pump), anxiety disorder, weight over 300 lbs.\n\n2. Pre-imaging preparation\nWhen subjects arrive at the scanner they must complete the screening form to verify that they have\nno contraindications for scanning (see sample form at end of handout). All investigators entering the\nscanning environment must be similarly screened. Subjects must provide informed consent to\nparticipate in the study. Subjects and investigators must remove all metallic objects before entering the\nscan room, including coins in pockets, watches, wallets, hair pins, safety pins, and make-up.\n\nC. Distress in the MR environment\n-\nIncidence of distress\nDistress in the MR environment includes all subjectively unpleasant experiences that are directly\nattributable to the MR study. The distress of subjects undergoing MR studies can range from mild\nanxiety that can be managed simply with minimal reassurance, to a full-blown panic attack that may\nrequire psychiatric intervention. Severe psychological distress reactions to MR imaging, namely anxiety\nand panic attacks, are typically characterized by the rapid onset of at least four of the following clinical\nsigns: fear of losing control or dying, nausea, paresthesias, palpitations, chest pain, faintness, shortness\nof breath, feeling of choking, sweating, trembling, vertigo, or depersonalization. Appropriate screening\nprocedures to exclude susceptible subjects from studies are required. For clinical research studies in\nwhich the subject population of interest has an anxiety disorder e.g. claustrophobia, generalized anxiety\ndisorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder or a cognitive deficit, it is\nalways necessary to use measures to minimize distress.\n\nResearch studies on the incidence of anxiety responses to MR imaging have only been conducted\non patients undergoing diagnostic procedures. Note that clinical imaging to diagnose or stage disease is\ninherently distressing. In that population, moderate distress severe enough to be described as a dysphoric\npsychological reaction has been reported by as many as 65% of the patients examined by MR imaging.\nThe most severe forms of psychological distress described by patients are claustrophobia, and anxiety or\n\npanic attacks. Claustrophobia is a disorder characterized by the marked, persistent and excessive fear of\nenclosed spaces. In such affected individuals exposure to enclosed spaces such as the MR environment\nalmost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response that can be indistinguishable from a panic\nattack as described above.\n\nThere are no good predictors of who will experience distress in the MR environment. In fact,\ndifferent studies cite opposing results such as which gender has greater difficulty tolerating the MR\nstudies. These differences may reflect cultural, socioeconomic or other influences such as the behavior\nof the research scientist.\n\nMotion artifact disrupting the MR image quality is frequently the result of subject distress.\nMotion artifacts can compromise the quality of MR image data. A recent clinical study of 297 first-time\nMR outpatients demonstrated that approximately 13% of all MR studies showed motion artifacts\nunrelated to normal physiological variables and about half of these impaired the diagnostic quality of the\nexamination. Excessive anxiety with accompanying tremors, trembling, and jaw clenching has been\npresumed to contribute to motion artifacts in MR images and has even erroneously been reported as\nfunctional activation in bilateral temporal lobes in an early PET study.\n\n-\nFactors that contribute to distress\nThe physical environment of the MR system can be a source of distress to subjects. Sensations of\napprehension, tension, worry, claustrophobia, anxiety, fear, and even panic attacks have been directly\nattributed to the confining dimensions of the interior of the MR system in the clinical studies (e.g., the\npatient's face may be three to ten inches from the inner portion of the MR system).\n\nSimilar distressing sensations have been attributed to the prolonged duration of the MR\nexamination, the gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise, the temperature and humidity within\nthe MR system, and the distress related to the restriction of movement. For example, gradient field\ninduced noise is sufficiently intense to cause transient hearing threshold shifts in as many as 43% of\npatients undergoing MR procedures. Other studies have reported stress related to the administration of a\nMRI contrast agent. Additionally, the MR system may produce a feeling of sensory deprivation, which\nis also known to be a precursor of severe anxiety states.\n\nAdverse psychological reactions are sometimes associated with the MR procedures because the\nstudy may be perceived by the patient as a \"dramatic\" medical test that has an associated uncertainty of\noutcome (i.e., there is a fear of the presence of disease or other abnormality). For those fMRI studies\nconducted in clinical research populations, even when subjects are informed that the study is only for\nresearch purposes and is not going to affect their treatment or prognosis, they may still have\nexpectations or concerns.\n\n-\nTechniques to minimize subjective distress\nCertain measures to alleviate subject distress should be employed for all studies. A number of\nother measures will be required if the subject is experiencing significant distress due to factors as\ndescribed above. Finally, other distress-alleviation techniques will only be necessary for subjects with\nco-existing psychiatric illness or other special problems.\n\nThe single most important step is to educate the subject about the specific aspects of the MR\nexamination that are known to be particularly difficult to tolerate. This includes conveying, in terms that\nare understandable, the internal dimensions of the MR system, the level of gradient magnetic field-\ninduced acoustic noise to expect, the estimated time duration of the study, and the need to remain still\nduring imaging.\n\nUpon entering MR facility, subjects who are treated with respect and are welcomed into a calm\nenvironment will experience less distress. Many details of subject positioning in the MR system can\nincrease comfort and minimize distress. Taking time to ensure comfortable positioning with adequate\npadding and blankets to ensure no undue pain from positioning is also important. Adequate ear\nprotection should be provided routinely to decrease acoustic noise from the MR system. Demonstrate\nthe two-way intercom system to reassure the subject that the MR staff can hear them when they speak\nand can speak to them.\n\nMaintain verbal contact via the intercom system or physical contact by having a study staff person\nremain in the MR system room with the subject during the examination to decrease psychological\ndistress. All subjects should be given a \"panic button\" that allows them to immediately communicate\nsevere distress. MR system-mounted mirrors or prism glasses can be used to permit the subject to\nmaintain a vertical view of the outside of the MR system in order to minimize phobic responses.\n\nThe environment of the MR system may be changed to optimize the management of apprehensive\nsubjects. For example, the presence of higher lighting levels tends to make most individuals feel less\nanxious. Therefore, the use of bright lights at either end and inside of the MR system can produce a less\nimposing environment. In addition, using a fan inside of the MR system to provide more air movement\nwill help reduce the sensation of confinement and lessen any tissue heating that may result from RF\npower deposition during imaging.\n\nLet the Neuroscientist Beware!\nThe following measures that have been shown to be effective in minimizing subjective distress\nmay not be compatible with your functional imaging studies. The following suggestions should only be\nemployed after careful consideration of the impact they may have on the functional imaging data to be\ncollected. (Consider why)\n\nSome MR staff have reported that placing a cotton pad moistened with a few drops of essential\nlemon or vanilla oil or other similarly used form of aroma therapy in the MR system close enough so\nthat the subject may receive olfactory stimulation can also reduce distress. Electronic devices that utilize\ncompressed air to transmit music or audio communication through headphones have been developed\nspecifically for use with MR systems. MR-compatible music/audio systems may be acquired from a\ncommercial vendor or can be made by adapting an airplane pneumatic earphone headset. MR-\ncompatible music systems can be used to provide calming music to the subject and, with the proper\ndesign, help to minimize exposure to gradient magnetic field-induced acoustic noise. Reports have\nindicated that the use of these devices has been successful in reducing symptoms of anxiety in subjects\nduring MR procedures. In addition, it is now possible to provide visual stimulation to the patient via a\nprojection television.\n\nAdditional measures such as pre-imaging behavioral therapy, hypnosis and sedation have been\nsuccessfully employed for clinical imaging studies that are essential for diagnostic purposes (see\ndiscussion in 1 for full details).\n\n2. Ethical Conduct of fMRI Research involving Human Subjects\n\nA. Investigator Training\nIt is the responsibility of every investigator who conducts research with human subjects, healthy or\notherwise, to be fully informed about and to practice current standards of good clinical practice. It has\n\nbeen said, \"ignorance is blameworthy\". This information is widely available and each institution has an\noffice to assist you. Harvard, HMS (http://www.hms.harvard.edu/integrity/) and MIT all have official\npolicy statements regarding the responsible conduct of research. Read them. Practice safe research.\n\nYou are responsible for understanding the rights of your human subjects and the requirements for\nobtaining true informed consent. You can peruse the federal Office for Human Research Protections\nwebsite. Required reading includes:\n1- The Belmont Report: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.htm\n2- Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46 Protection of Human Subject\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm\n\nYou may choose to complete the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI) human subjects\nresearch educational program. The CITI offers many advantages, primarily the depth and breadth of\ninformation pertaining to human-subject research and the case-based application of ethical concepts and\nregulations in a web-based learning environment. You can register for the CITI program through\nhttps://www.citiprogram.org/default.asp.\n\nB. Critical Elements to Informed Consent\nThere can be no element of coercion in the recruitment of research subjects. All subjects have\nthe \"right\" to say no. For example, in the setting of a lab director asking a trainee to participate in a\nstudy, the right to say \"no\" is violated by the conflict generated by the director's position of authority\nover the trainee.\nAll risks must be clearly specified in the consent. For a typical fMRI study at either 1.5T or 3T,\nthe information that is required includes the following:\n\n\"There are no known or foreseeable risks or side effects associated with conventional MRI\nprocedures except to those people who have electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated\nimplants (such as cardiac pacemakers) or to those who have clips on blood vessels in their brain. There\nare no known additional risks associated with high-speed MRI. Both the conventional and the high\nspeed MRI systems have been approved by the FDA and will be operated within the standards reviewed\nand accepted by the FDA.\nA magnetic resonance scan is not uncomfortable. You will lie on a table that slides into a\nhorizontal cylinder that is only slightly wider than your body. You will be asked to lie still, but you will\neasily be able to hear and speak to the research staff. The MR scanner makes loud knocking or beeping\nsounds during imaging; earplugs will be provided to help reduce this noise. There should not be any\nsignificant discomfort during this procedure. If you notice any discomfort you should notify the\ninvestigators as soon as possible. If the discomfort cannot be reduced to an acceptable level, the\nscanning session may be stopped. The MRI can be stopped at any time at your request. If you are prone\nto claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) you should notify the course director in charge of the scan.\nIf you are or might be pregnant, it is recommended that you do not participate in this MRI study.\"\n\nC. Risk/Benefit Considerations\nOver the past several years the bar has been raised in terms of the allowable risk/benefit ratio for\nIRB approved studies. For example, it is no longer possible to get federal funding or IRB approval for\nstudies to expose patients to the risks of imaging solely to learn about the underlying scientific basis of\nthe disorder. Instead, the investigator must demonstrate how the outcome of the study will directly\nimpact the clinical care of that study population. This is true not only for clinical trials of potential new\ntreatments, but also for pharmaceutical challenge studies.\n\nIt is incumbent upon each investigator to determine all potential risks or adverse outcomes from a\nproposed study and to establish that the benefit to society will sufficiently outweigh the risk to the\nparticipating individuals.\n\n************************************************************************\nCase Study:\nIntraoperative Registration of Medical Images by Temporarily Implanted Fiducial Markers\n\nYou have been diagnosed with an operable brain tumor. In order to identify the size, location, and\nmargins of the tumor, a stereotactic frame has been affixed to your skull. You will be having MR and CT\nimaging studies done with the frame in place and then later will have your surgery. The frames are\nterribly bulky and uncomfortable, quite invasive, very unsightly, and can interfere with optimal imaging.\nThe neurosurgeon has approached you about participating in a research study in which small fiducial\nmarkers will be anchored to your skull and will remain in place for the imaging and surgical portions of\nyour medical care. You are given a consent form that describes the procedure by which the markers will\nbe implanted. The consent includes information that the markers themselves have no known adverse\nhealth effects.\n\n1. What questions do you have for your physician?\n\n2. What are your concerns? Do you express them to your physician? If so, what do you say?\n\n3. Would you agree to participate in this study? If so, why? If not, why not?

Response moni-\ntoring involves evaluating the consequences of behaviour and making adjustments to optimize outcomes.\nDeficiencies in this function, and abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on which it relies, have\nbeen reported as contributing factors to autistic disorders. We investigated whether ACC structure and func-\ntion during response monitoring were associated with repetitive behaviour in ASD. We compared ACC activa-\ntion to correct and erroneous antisaccades using rapid presentation event-related functional MRI in 14 control\nand ten ASD participants. Because response monitoring is the product of coordinated activity in ACC\nnetworks, we also examined the microstructural integrity of the white matter (WM) underlying this brain\nregion using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) in I2 control and I2 adult\nASD participants. ACC activation and FA were examined in relation to Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised\nratings of restricted and repetitive behaviour. Relative to controls, ASD participants: (i)made more antisac-\ncade errors and responded more quickly on correct trials; (ii)showed reduced discrimination between error\nand correct responses in rostral ACC (rACC), which was primarily due to (iii)abnormally increased activation\non correct trials and (iv) showed reduced FA in WM underlying ACC. Finally, in ASD (v) increased activation\non correct trials and reduced FA in rACC WM were related to higher ratings of repetitive behaviour. These\nfindings demonstrate functional and structural abnormalities of the ACC in ASD that may contribute to\nrepetitive behaviour. rACC activity following errors is thought to reflect affective appraisal of the error. Thus,\nthe hyperactive rACC response to correct trials can be interpreted as a misleading affective signal that\nsomething is awry, which may trigger repetitive attempts at correction. Another possible consequence of\nreduced affective discrimination between error and correct responses is that it might interfere with the\nreinforcement of responses that optimize outcomes. Furthermore, dysconnection of the ACC, as suggested\nby reduced FA, to regions involved in behavioural control might impair on-line modulations of response\nspeed to optimize performance (i.e. speed-accuracy trade-off) and increase error likelihood. These findings\nsuggest that in ASD, structural and functional abnormalities of the ACC compromise response monitor-\ning and thereby contribute to behaviour that is rigid and repetitive rather than flexible and responsive to\ncontingencies. Illuminating the mechanisms and clinical significance of abnormal response monitoring in\nASD represents a fruitful avenue for further research.\nKeywords: autism; anterior cingulate cortex; response monitoring; functional MRI; diffusion tensor imaging\nAbbreviations: ACC =anterior cingulate cortex; ADI-R =autism diagnostic interview-revised; ASD =autism spectrum\ndisorders; BOLD = blood oxygen level dependent; CWP =cluster-wise probability; dACC =dorsal ACC; DTI =diffusion\ntensor imaging; ERN =error-related negativity; HC =healthy control; IQ = intelligence quotient; MPRAGE = magnetization\nprepared rapid gradient echo; OCD =obsessive-compulsive disorder; rACC = rostral ACC; TE =echo time; TR = repetition\ntime; WM =white matter\nReceived December 19,200ZRevised March 14, 2008.

Antisaccades are well-suited for examining\nresponse monitoring because they have a relatively well-\ndelineated neuroanatomy and neurophysiology (for review\nsee: Munoz and Everling, 2004), generate robust electro-\nphyisological\nerror\nmarkers,\nERN,\nerror\npositivity\n(Nieuwenhuis et al.,\n2001) and ACC hemodynamic\nresponses (Polli et al., 2005) and involve a high degree of\nresponse conflict. Moreover, individuals with developmen-\ntal disorders affecting social processing, including ASD,\nconsistently show a n increased rate of antisaccade errors\n(i.e. a failure to suppress the prepotent prosaccade)\n(Manoach et al.,\n1997, 2004; Minshew et al., 1999;\nGoldberg et al., 2002; Luna et al., 2007), which may reflect,\nin part, aberrant evaluation of performance and modifica-\ntion of prepotent stimulus-response mappings.\nW e examined group differences in ACC activation during\ncorrect and erroneous antisaccade trials using rapid\npresentation\nevent-related\nfMRI.\nComparisons\nwere\nrestricted to antisaccade trials since healthy and ASD\nparticipants produce too few prosaccade errors with this\nparadigm (Manoach et al., 2004). W e examined activity in\nrostra1 and dorsal ACC (rACC, dACC) separately, given\ntheir differences in cytoarchitecture, function and connec-\ntivity (Devinsky et al., 1995; Bush et al., 1998; Whalen et al.,\n1998) and distinct patterns of haemodynamic activity\nduring antisaccade error commission (Polli et al., 2005).\nSince response monitoring is the product of coordinated\nactivity between the ACC and functionally related regions\n(Holroyd and Coles, 2002), and the ACC shows evidence of\ndecreased structural and functional connectivity in autism\n(Barnea-Goraly et al., 2004; Kana et al., 2007), we also\nexamined the microstructural integrity of the W M under-\nlying the ACC using DTI. W e expected ASD participants to\nshow: (i) a n increased antisaccade error rate; (ii) increased\nACC activity during both correct and erroneous antisaccade\ntrials and (iii) reduced FA in the W M underlying ACC.\nFinally, we hypothesized that (iv) structural and functional\nACC abnormalities would be associated with rigid,\nrepetitive behaviour in ASD.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTwelve adults with ASD and 14 healthy control (HC) participants\nwere recruited by poster and website advertisements (see Table 1\nfor demographic data). Participants with ASD were diagnosed\nwith autism (n = 8), Asperger's disorder (n =2) or pervasive\ndevelopmental disorder, not otherwise specified (n =2) by an\nexperienced clinician (R.M.J.) on the basis of current presentation\nand developmental history as determined by medical record\nreview and clinical interview. Potential participants meeting\nDSM-IV criteria for co-morbid psychiatric conditions or substance\nabuse were excluded. ASD diagnoses were confirmed using the\nAutism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R: Rutter et al.,\n2003) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Module\n4 (Lord et al., 1999) administered by research reliable personnel.\nBmin (2008)\nPage 3 of 15\nTable I Means, standard deviations and group\ncomparisons of demographic data\nSubject\nHC\nASD\nT\nP\ncharacteristics\n(n = 14)\n(n= 12)\nAge\n2 7 f 8\n30* 11\n-0.69\n0.50\nSex\n8Ml6F\nIOM/2F\n+ =0.28\n0.22\nLaterality\n75 & 45\n61 &38\n0.86\n0.40\nscore\n(Handedness)\nParental SESa\n1.31 *0.48\n1.17 *0.39\nz = -0.60\n0.42\nYears of\n16&2\n16&3\n-0.51\n0.62\neducation\nEstimated\n114*9\n116*8\n-0.62\n0.54\nverbal I Q ~\n'A lower score denotes higher status.

Four\nof the 12 ASD participants were taking the following medications:\nfluoxetine and lithium; buproprion and clonazepam; citalopram\nand sertraline and methylphenidate.\nHC participants were screened to exclude a history of autism or\nany other neurological or psychiatric condition. AU participants\nwere screened to exclude substance abuse or dependence within the\npreceding 6 months, and any independent condition that might\naffect brain function. ASD and control groups were matched for\nage, sex, handedness as measured by a laterality score on the\nmodified Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (scores of -100 and\n+lo0 denote exclusive use of left or right hands, respectively)\n(Oldfield, 1971; White and Ashton, 1976), parental socioeconomic\nstatus on the Hollingshead Index (Hollingshead, 1965), years of\neducation and estimated verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) based on\na test of single word reading (American National Adult Reading\nTest: Blair and Spreen, 1989). All ASD participants had average or\nabove estimates of verbal (124 & 12, range: 106-141) and non-verbal\n(120f 10, range: 100-138) IQ as measured by the Wechsler\nAbbreviated Scale of Intelligence (Wechsler, 1999). The study\nwas approved by the Partners Human Research Committee.\nAll participants gave written informed consent after the experi-\nmental procedures had been fully explained.\nfMKI data were unusable for one ASD participant due to eye\ntracking malfunction. For a second ASD participant, data were not\nacquired because scanner-safe glasses of the correct prescription\nwere not available. fMKI analyses were conducted on the\nremaining 10 ASD and 14 control participants. Saccadic latency\ndata for one control participant was omitted from analysis due to\nan acquisition problem. DTI data were acquired on all 12 ASD\nparticipants and 12 of the 14 controls.\nSaccadic paradigm\nPrior to scanning, the task was explained and participants practiced\nin a mock scanner until their performance indicated that they\nunderstood the directions and were comfortable with the task.\nParticipants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as\npossible and told that they would receive a bonus of 5 cents for each\ncorrect response in addition to a base rate of pay. Each run of the\n\nPage 4 of 15\nBrain (2008)\ntask consisted of a pseudorandom sequence of prosaccade and\nantisaccade trials that were balanced for right and left movements.\nFigure 1 provides a graphic depiction of the task and a description\nof task parameters. Randomly interleaved with the saccadic trials\nwere intervals of fxation lasting 2, 4 or 6s. The fxation intervals\nprovided a baseline and their variable length introduced 'temporal\njitter', which optimizes the analysis of rapid presentation event-\nrelated fMRI designs (Buckner et al., 1998; Burock and Dale, 2000;\nMiezin et al., 2000). The schedule of events was determined using a\ntechnique to optimize the statistical efticiency of event-related\ndesigns (Dale, 1999). Participants performed six runs of the task,\neach lasting 5 min 22s, with short rests between runs. The total\nexperiment lasted about 40min and generated a total of 211\nprosaccade and 21 1 antisaccade trials, and 80 f ~ a t i o n intervals.\nStimulus display and eye tracking\nDisplays of the eye movement task were generated using\nthe Vision Shell programming platform (www.visionshell.com,\nWatertown, MA, USA), and back-projected with a Sharp XG-2000\ncolor LCD projector (Osaka, Japan) onto a screen at the rear of the\nbore that was viewed by the participant via a mirror on the head\ncoil. The ISCAN MRI Remote Eye Tracking Laboratory (ISCAN,\nBurlington, MA) recorded saccades during scanning. This system\nused a video camera mounted at the rear of the MRI bore.\nA Prosaccade\n1 'O\"\ntarget position\neye position\nB Antisaccade\ntarget position\neye position\nC Timeline\nTime frns): , 0-\n- - -\n(see above)\nFixation\nI\nI\n(3t0\":s)\n(1700ms)\nK. N.Thakkar et al.\nThe camera imaged the eye of the participant via an optical\ncombiner, a 45\" cold transmissive mirror that reflects an infrared\nimage of the eye, with the infrared illumination being provided by an\nLED mounted on the head coil. The system used passive optical\ncomponents with no ferrous content within the bore to minimize\nartefacts in the MRI images. Eye position was sampled at a rate of\n60Hz. Eye images were processed by ISCAN's RK-726PCI high\nresolution PupilICorneal reflection tracker, located outside of the\nshielded MRI room. Stimuli presented by Vision Shell were digitally\nencoded and relayed to TSCAN as triggers that were inserted into the\neye movement recordings.\nScoring and analysis of eye movement data\nEye movement data were scored in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick,\nMA) using a partially automated programme that determined the\ndirectional accuracy of each saccade with respect to the required\nresponse and the latency from target onset. Saccades were\nidentified as horizontal eye movements with velocities exceeding\n47\"Is. The onset of a saccade was defined as the point at which the\nvelocity of the eye movement first exceeded 3l0/s. Only trials with\nsaccades in the desired direction and latencies over 130 ms were\nconsidered correct, and only correct saccades were included in\nthe latency analyses. The cutoff of 130ms excluded anticipatory\nsaccades, which are executed too quickly to be a valid response to\nright\nk-4\nlatency\nlatencynu\nStimulus\nFixation\nFig. I Saccadic paradigm with idealized eye position traces. Saccadic trials lasted 4000 ms and began with an instructional cue at the\ncentre of the screen. For half of the participants, orange concentric rings were the cue for a prosaccade trial (A) and a blue cross was the\ncue for an antisaccade trial (B).These cues were reversed for the rest of the participants.The cue was flanked horizontally by two small\ngreen squares of 0.2\" width that marked the potential locations of stimulus appearance, 10\" left and right of centre.These squares remained\non the screen for the duration of each run. (C)A t 300 ms, the instructional cue was replaced by a green fixation ring at the centre of the\nscreen, of 0.4\" diameter and luminance of 20 cd/m2. After 1700 ms, the ring shifted t o one of the two target locations, right or left, with\nequal probability. This was the stimulus t o which the participant responded by either making a saccade t o it (prosaccade) or t o the square\non the opposite side (antisaccade).The green ring remained in the peripheral location for 1000 ms and then returned t o the centre, where\nparticipants were also t o return their gaze for 1000 ms before the start of the next trial. Fixation intervals were simply a continuation of\nthe fixation display that constituted the final second of the previous saccadic trial.\n\nAbnormal response monitoring in autism\nBmin (2008)\nPage 5 of 15\nthe appearance of the target (Fischer and Breitmeyer, 1987).\nWe classified corrective saccades that followed antisaccade errors\ninto short and long latency self-corrections (c.f. Polli et al., 2006):\nthose with latencies (from error initiation) >I30 ms suggesting\nthat the correction was a conscious (aware) response to\nvisual feedback regarding an error, and those with latencies\n4 3 0 ms suggesting that the correction represented a concurrently\nprogrammed correct saccade and that the participant was\nunaware of having made an error (Mokler and Fischer, 1999;\nMcPeek et al., 2000). Post-error slowing was calculated for each\nparticipant as the difference in latency between correct trials\npreceded by an error and correct trials preceded by a correct\nresponse. Error rate and latency of correct trials were analysed\nusing randomized block ANOVAs with Group (ASD versus\ncontrols) as the between-subjects factor, Task (antisaccade versus\nprosaccade) as the within-subjects factor and subjects nested\nwithin group as the random factor. Post-error slowing and self-\ncorrection rates for antisaccades were compared by group using\nt-tests.\nImage acquisition\nImages were acquired with a 3.OT Siemens Trio whole body high-\nspeed imaging device equipped for echo planar imaging (Siemens\nMedical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). Head stabilization was\nachieved with cushioning, and all participants wore earplugs\n(29dB rating) to attenuate noise. Automated shimming proce-\ndures were performed and scout images were obtained. Two high-\nresolution structural images were acquired in the sagittal plane for\nslice prescription, spatial normalization (spherical and Talairach)\nand cortical surface reconstruction using a high resolution 3D\nmagnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence\n(repetition time (TR), 2530ms; echo spacing, 7.25ms; echo time\n(TE), 3 ms; flip angle 7\") with an in-plane resolution of 1 and\n1.3mm slice thickness. T1- and T2-weighted structural images,\nwith the same slice specifications as the Blood Oxygen Level\nDependent (BOLD) scans, were obtained to assist in registering\nfunctional and structural images.\nfMRl\nFunctional images were collected using a gradient echo T2*\nweighted sequence (TR/TE/Flip = 2000 ms130 ms/9O0). Twenty\ncontiguous horizontal slices parallel to the intercommissural plane\n(voxel size: 3.13 x 3.13 x 5mm) were acquired interleaved. The\nfunctional sequences included prospective acquisition correction\nfor head motion (Thesen et a/., 2000). Prospective acquisition\ncorrection adjusts slice position and orientation in real time\nduring data acquisition. This reduces motion-induced effects on\nmagnetization history.\nDTI\nSingle-shot echo planar imaging DTI was acquired using a twice\nrefocused spin echo sequence (Reese et a/., 2003) with the fol-\nlowing sequence parameters: TRITE = 8400182 ms; b = 700 s/mm2;\nNEX = 1; 10 T2 images acquired with b =0; 72 diffusion directions;\n128 x 128 matrix; 2 x 2mm in-plane resolution; 64 axial oblique\n(AC-PC) slices; 2mm (Omm gap) slice thickness; scan duration\n12'44\". The n= 72 diffusion directions were obtained using the\nelectrostatic shell algorithm (Jones, 2004).\nSurface-based analyses fir fMRl and DTI\nFunctional and FA volumes were aligned to the 3D structural\nimage for each participant that was created by averaging the two\nMPRAGE scans after correcting for motion. The averaged\nMPRAGE scans were used to construct inflated (2D) models of\nindividual cortical surfaces using previously described segmenta-\ntion, surface reconstruction and inflation algorithms (Dale et al.,\n1999; Fischl et a/., 1999a). To register data across participants,\nanatomical, functional and DTI scans were spatially normalized\nusing a surface-based spherical coordinate system that employs a\nnon-rigid alignment algorithm that explicitly aligns cortical\nfolding patterns and is relatively robust to inter-individual\ndifferences in the gyral and sulcal anatomy of cingulate cortex\n(Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 1999a, b). For both fMRI and DTI,\nthe ACC was localized using an automated surface-based\nparcellation system that includes a label for the ACC (Fischl\net al., 2004). The ACC label was divided into dorsal and rostra1\nsegments by drawing a line perpendicular to the intercommissural\nplane at the anterior boundary of the genu of the corpus callosum\n(Devinsky et al., 1995).\nfMRI and DTI results were displayed on a template brain\nconsisting of the averaged cortical surface of an independent\nsample of 40 adults from the Buckner laboratory at Washington\nUniversity. To correct for multiple comparisons we ran 10 000\nMonte Carlo simulations of synthesized white Gaussian noise\nusing a P-value of G0.05 and the smoothing, resampling and\naveraging parameters of the functional analyses. This determines\nthe likelihood that a cluster of a certain size would be found by\nchance for a given threshold. To test our a priori hypotheses\nconcerning ACC function and structure, we restricted the\nsimulations to our ACC ROIs. To determine whether other\nregions also showed significant group differences we also ran\nsimulations to correct for multiple comparisons on the entire\ncortical surface. To facilitate comparison with other studies,\napproximate Talairach coordinates were derived by mapping the\nsurface-based coordinates of activation and FA maxima back to\nthe original structural volume for each participant, registering the\nvolumes to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MN1305) atlas\n(Collins et al., 1994) and averaging the MNI305 coordinates that\ncorresponded to the surface maxima across participants. The\nresulting coordinates were transformed to standard Talairach\nspace using an algorithm developed by Matthew Brett (http:l/\nfMRl data analyses\nAnalyses were conducted using FreeSurfer (Fischl et a/., 1999a)\nand FreeSurfer Functional Analysis Stream (FS-FAST) software\n(Burock and Dale, 2000). In addition to on-line motion correction\n(prospective acquisition correction), functional scans were cor-\nrected retrospectively for motion using the AFNI algorithm (Cox\nand Jesmanowicz, 1999). To characterize average motion for each\nparticipant, total motion in millimetres for all six directions\n(x, y, z and three rotational directions) as determined by AFNI,\nwas averaged across the six runs of the task and compared\nbetween groups. Following motion correction, scans were intensity\nnormalized, and smoothed using a 3D 8mm FWHM Gaussian\nkernel. Finite impulse response estimates (Burock and Dale, 2000;\nMiezin et al., 2000) of the event-related haemodynamic responses\nwere calculated for each of the four trial types (correct\nprosaccades, error prosaccades, correct antisaccades and error\n\nPage 6 of 15\nBrain (2008)\nantisaccades) for each participant. This involved using a linear\nmodel to provide unbiased estimates of the average signal intensity\nat each time point for each trial type without making a priori\nassumptions about the shape of the haemodynamic response.\nHaemodynamic response estimates were computed at 12 time\npoints with an interval of 2 s (corresponding to the TR) ranging\nfrom 4 s prior to the start of a trial to 18 s after the start.\nTemporal correlations in the noise were accounted for by pre-\nwhitening using a global estimate of the residual error auto-\ncorrelation function truncated at 30 s (Burock and Dale, 2000).\nRegistered group data were smoothed with a 2D 4.6mm\nFWHM Gaussian kernel. We compared activation in error versus\ncorrect antisaccades, and in both correct and error antisaccades\nversus fwation, both within and between groups using a random\neffects model. We examined the 6 and 8 s time points that showed\npeak error-related activation in previous studies (Polli et al., 2005,\n2008).\nDTI analysis\nThe objective of the DTI analysis was to measure FA in the WM\nunderlying specific regions using a vertex-wise analysis of the\nregistered group data. FA was measured in the undeformed WM\n2mm below the WMIgray matter boundary. This strategy\nminimizes partial volume contributions from cortical gray\nmatter and preserves regional specificity (the rationale for the\nsurface-based approach is elaborated in Manoach et al., 2007a).\nDTI data were analysed using the following multi-step procedure:\n(1) Motionleddy current distortion correction: Raw diffusion\ndata were corrected for head motion and residual eddy\ncurrent distortion by registering all images to the first T2\nimage, which was acquired with b=O. The registration was\nperformed using the FLIRT tool (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001)\nfrom the FSL software library (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).\nThe registration used a global affine (12 df) transformation, a\nmutual information cost function and sinc resampling.\n(2) Tensor reconstruction: The diffusion tensor and FA volumes\nwere reconstructed using the standard least-squares fit to the\nlog diffusion signal (Basser et al., 1994).\n(3) Registration of FA and T1 volumes: FA volumes were\nregistered to the high-resolution structural (TI) volumes for\neach participant using the T2 volume as an intermediary.\nThis avoids the potential bias that might arise from using the\nFA volume in the registration, since FA is the variable of\ninterest. In addition, the graylwhite boundary in the T1\nvolume has better correspondence with the T2 volume than\nthe FA volume, allowing for a more accurate registration. The\nT2 volume was taken from the b=O image in the DTI\nacquisition and was, therefore, in register with the FA\nvolume. Each participant's averaged T2 volume was manually\nregistered to the T1 volume with Tkregister2 (http:/1\nsurfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu)using 9 df including translation,\nrotation and scaling. Manual registration was used to\nmaximize anatomic agreement along the medial wall and\nbecause echo planar imaging susceptibility distortions in DTI\ncan confound global registration procedures. The resulting\nspatial transformation was applied to the FA volume, thus\nbringing the FA and T1 volumes into register.\n(4) Projection of subcortical FA values onto the WMIgray matter\ninterface: For each participant, a surface representation of the\nWM/gray matter boundary was derived from the TI volume\nK. N.Thakkar et al.\nusing the previously described segmentation, surface recon-\nstruction and inflation algorithm (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl\net al., 1999a). FA was sampled in the WM 2mm below the\nWMlgray matter boundary for each vertex on the surface and\nthen projected onto the WMlgray interface. FA values were\nsmoothed using n =50 iterations of replacement by nearest\nneighbours. This corresponds to smoothing by -10mm\nFWHM on the surface.\n(5) Registration of surface FA maps across participants: This was\nachieved by applying the surface transformations from the\nspatial normalization of the TI maps to the FA maps, which\nwere in register with T1 maps (step 3).\n(6) To test for significant group differences in FA in the\nregistered group data, a t-test was performed in the WM\nunderlying each vertex.\nRelations of ACC function and structure to\nrestricted, repetitive behaviour in ASD\nMRI activation in each contrast at 6 and 8 s and FA values were\nregressed onto ADI-R diagnostic algorithm scores of restricted and\nrepetitive behaviours for every vertex on the cortical surface. In\nthe regression of FA values on ADI-R scores, age was used as a\ncovariate given the documented relation of increasing age with\ndecreasing FA (Pfefferbaum et al., 2000).\nResults\nSaccadic performance\nASD participants made significantly more errors than H C\n[F(1,22)= 7.82, P =0.0081.

As group differences\nin activation were more pronounced at the 8 s than the 6s\ntime point, we report findings from 8 s only.\nControls showed a more differentiated response to error\nversus correct trials than ASD participants in the right rACC,\nextending into the dACC (Fig. 3A, Table 2). The basis of this\ngroup difference was that ASD participants showed signifi-\ncantly greater activation to correct responses in bilateral\nrACC (Fig. 3B, Table 2). In this region, the group difference in\nthe response to errors was not significant (Fig. 3C), and\nwithin group analyses revealed that while both groups showed\na significant response to errors bilaterally (Control: left\nmaximum -9, 37, 12, cluster size= 1204 mm2, cluster-wise\nprobability (CWP) =0.0001; right maximum 7,26, 18, cluster\nsize = 1561 mm2, CWP =0.0001; ASD: left maximum -5, 34,\n5, cluster size = 1112 mm2, CWP =0.0001; right maximum 9,\n38, 12, cluster size =850 mm2, CWP =0.0001), only the ASD\ngroup showed a significant response to correct trials (left\nmaximum -7, 40, 1, cluster size = 1 107mm2, CWP =0.0001;\nright maximum\n7,\n39, 11, cluster size= 1498mm2,\nCWP =0.0001). Compared with controls, ASD participants\nalso showed significantly greater activation for correct trials in\nanother more anterior perigenual rACC region bilaterally\n(Fig. 3B), and in the left hemisphere this region also showed a\nsignificantly greater response to errors (Fig. 3C). Controls did\nnot activate this perigenual rACC region for either correct or\nerror responses. When multiple comparisons correction was\napplied to the entire cortical surface, the finding that the ASD\ngroup showed an exaggerated response to correct trials in\nright rACC extending into dACC remained significant\n(CWP=0.0001). The only other significant group difference\nin cortical activation was a less differentiated response for\nASD participants to error versus correct responses in the\nmedial aspect of the right superior frontal gyrus.\nFour of our ASD participants were taking medications\nthat could affect ACC function. A re-analysis of the data\nwith only unmedicated ASD participants confirmed the\nmain findings that in the right rACC, ASD participants\nshowed significantly less discrimination between correct\nand error trials and greater activation to correct trials\n(Table 2, Supplementary Figure).\nDTI analyses\nASD participants showed significantly reduced FA in the\nWM underlying rACC and dACC bilaterally (Fig. 4,\nTable 2). The maxima in both hemispheres were in rACC\nWM, near the border with dACC and FA reductions\nextended into the corpus callosum. These reductions met\nmultiple comparisons correction for the entire cortical\nsurface. Significantly reduced activation FA in ASD was also\nseen in the WM underlying bilateral frontopolar cortex,\nwhich, extended into dorsolateral and ventrolateral pre-\nfrontal cortex in the left hemisphere; bilateral intraparietal\nand parietal transverse sulci; and left precentral gyrus.\nThe only region showing significantly greater FA in ASD\nparticipants versus controls was in the WM underlying\nright insula.\nRelations of ACC function and structure to\nADI-R scores of restricted and repetitive\nbehaviour in ASD\nRegression analyses showed that in ASD, higher ADI-R\nrestricted and repetitive behaviour scores were associated\nwith greater activation during correct trials versus fixation\nat 8 s in the right rACC (Fig. 5A, Table 2). This right rACC\nregion overlapped with the regions showing both signifi-\ncantly increased activation to correct trials and reduced FA.\nRepetitive behaviour scores were not significantly associated\nwith ACC activation in other contrasts at either 6 or 8s.\nThe only other cortical region showing a significant relation\nat 8s was the right paracentral gyrus extending into the\npostcentral gyrus in the error versus correct contrast.\n\nPage 8 of 15\nBrain (2008)\nK.

No other cortical regions showed\nsignificant relations in underlying WM.\nThe literature on repetitive behaviour in autism supports\na division into 'low-level' repetitive motor behaviour and\nmore complex behaviours that appear to be driven by\nideation (for review see, Turner, 1999). To assess the\nrelative importance of 'sensorimotor' versus 'ideational'\nforms of repetition in accounting for the observed relations\nwith ACC activation and structure, we first divided each\nparticipants' ADI-R repetitive behaviour score into 'senso-\nrimotor' (i.e. D3lD4: sterotypies, mannerisms, repetitive\nobject use, unusual sensory interests) and 'ideational' (i.e.\nDllD2: narrow restricted interests and rituals) subscores\n(Hollander et al., 2003). On average, the ideational subscore\naccounted for 65% 14% of the total repetitive behaviour\nscore. We then performed multiple regression analysis\nwith BOLD or FA value at the ACC maxima of the\nregression with total score as the dependent variable, and\nthe two subscores as covariates. Sensorimotor subscores\nwere more strongly related to activation in the ACC\n(P=0.04) than ideational subscores (P=0.17). The opposite\nwas true for FA, which showed a stronger correlations\nwith ideational subscores (P= 0.05) than sensorimotor\nsubscores (P= 0.18). The subscores did not differ signifi-\ncantly in their contribution to activation or FA, and neither\nimproved on the relations seen with the total repetitive\nbehaviour score (activation: P =0.0009; FA: P =0.04)\nsuggesting that both subscores contributed to the relations\nobserved.\nDiscussion\nThe present study demonstrates functional and structural\nabnormalities of the ACC in ASD that may contribute to\nrestricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour,\na defining feature of ASD. Compared with controls, ASD\nparticipants showed increased rACC activation to both\ncorrect and error responses and reduced microstructural\nintegrity of the WM underlying ACC, including in regions\nshowing abnormally increased response monitoring activa-\ntion. Moreover, in rACC increased activation to correct\ntrials and reduced FA were related to ratings of rigid,\nrepetitive behaviour. These findings support the hypothesis\nof hyperactive response monitoring in ASD and link it to\nrepetitive behaviour.\nRelative to controls, ASD participants showed reduced\ndiscrimination between error and correct trials in a rACC\nregion that responds to errors (Polli et al., 2005).

Reduced\ndiscrimination between response outcomes may interfere\nwith adjusting responses to obtain the most favourable\noutcome both with regard to subsequent trials and longer\nterm modification of the strength of stimulus-response\nmappings. This could contribute to behaviour that is\nstimulus-bound and repetitive rather than flexible and\nresponsive to contingencies. This provides a plausible\nexplanation for the relation between increased rACC\nactivity to correct trials and repetitive behaviour.\nA complementary explanation has been offered for the\nrelation of increased error signals to the severity of\nobsessions and compulsions in OCD (Gehring et al.,\n2000; Ursu et al., 2003). A longstanding theory of OCD\nposits that inappropriate and exaggerated error signals lead\nto a pervasive sense of incompleteness and self-doubt and\nbehavioural repetition represents a vain attempt to reduce\nthese error signals (Pitman, 1987). According to this theory,\nexaggerated ACC activation to correct trials reflects\ninappropriate error signalling and triggers a compulsion\nto repeat behaviours that were already successfully com-\npleted (Maltby et al., 2005). Similar to individuals with\nOCD, ASD participants showed an exaggerated ACC\nresponse to correct trials (Ursu et al., 2003; Maltby et al.,\n2005). While in OCD fMRI activation to correct trials was\nmaximal in dACC (Maltby et al., 2005), in ASD it was\nmaximal in rACC and was related to repetitive behaviour.\nWhile dACC activity following errors is thought to reflect\neither conflict or error detection (for review see: Ullsperger\nand von Cramon, 2004), rACC activity following errors has\nbeen interpreted as appraisal of the affective or motivational\nsalience of errors (van Veen and Carter, 2002; Luu et al.,\n2003; Taylor et al., 2006). Thus, one interpretation of this\nrelation is that it reflects an inappropriate affective response\nto correct performance that triggers behavioural repetition.\nThis exaggerated affective response may occur even with\nawareness that one has performed correctly. Regardless of its\nbasis, the relation between increased rACC responses to\ncorrect trials and repetitive behaviour suggests that aberrant\nresponse monitoring contributes to a defining feature of ASD.\nBoth ASD and OCD are characterized by behaviour that\nis rigid and not optimally responsive to contingency, and\nthere is evidence of both phenomenological overlap and\ndistinctions between the obsessions and compulsions of\nOCD and the restricted and repetitive behaviours of ASD,\nboth in terms of subjective experience and type of\nbehaviour (Baron-Cohen, 1989; McDougle et al., 1995;\nRussell et al., 2005; Zandt et al., 2007). Interestingly, a study\nof multiplex families of children with autism found that\nparents were significantly more likely to have obsessive-\ncompulsive traits or disorder if the children had high ADI-R\nrepetitive behaviour scores, and this was due to loading\n\nAbnormal response monitoring in autism\non ideational but not sensorimotor items (Hollander et al.,\n2003). This finding supports the distinction between\nrepetition of movements and repetition of more complex,\nideational behaviours (for review see, Turner, 1999) and\nsuggests that the latter may share underlying mechanisms in\nOCD and ASD. In the present study, both sensorimotor\nand ideational subscores contributed to the relations seen\nwith response monitoring activation and FA. At present,\nrepetitive behaviours in autism are incompletely under-\nstood, and neurobiologically valid dimensions are yet to be\ndelineated. The present findings suggest that ACC abnorm-\nalities may contribute to repetitive behaviour in ASD,\npossibly on the basis of their contribution to aberrant\nresponse monitoring, but linking ACC abnormalities to\nspecific dimensions of repetitive behaviour and identifying\nthe underlying mechanisms requires further study with\nlarge samples.\nAbnormal response monitoring may also contribute to\ndeficient cognitive control of behaviour in ASD, which, in\nthe present study, was reflected in an increased antisaccade\nerror rate, consistent with prior work (Manoach et al.,\n1997, 2004; Minshew et al., 1999; Goldberg et al., 2002;\nLuna et al., 2007) and possibly in reduced dynamic\nperformance adjustment. In spite of making more errors,\nASD participants responded more quickly than controls on\ncorrect trials suggesting a disruption in the speed-accuracy\ntrade-off. This apparent difficulty in modulating response\nspeed to improve accuracy is unlikely to reflect reduced\nerror awareness since ASD participants were as, or more\nlikely than controls to self-correct errors. Nor is it likely to\nreflect a blunted neural response to errors given both the\nincreased response to errors in left perigenual rACC and\nprevious work showing normal or increased amplitude of\nthe ERN in ASD (Henderson et al., 2006). Deficient use of\noutcomes to adjust performance in a continuous, dynamic\nfashion may stem from response monitoring dysfunction in\nthe ACC and/or from dysconnection of the ACC from\nocular motor regions involved in saccade generation.\nAberrant connectivity of ACC regions subserving response\nmonitoring in ASD is suggested by our finding of reduced\nFA in the underlying WM. This finding is consistent with a\nprevious report of reduced FA in ACC white matter in\nautism (Barnea-Goraly et al., 2004) and with evidence of\ndecreased functional connectivity of the ACC to other\nregions during a task involving response inhibition (Kana\net al., 2007).\nHow might information concerning the outcome of the\nprior response be communicated to ocular motor regions\nresponsible for adjusting behaviour in the subsequent trial?\nMonkey electrophysiology studies suggest a basis for speed-\naccuracy trade-offs in the ocular motor system. Compared\nwith prosaccades, antisaccades are associated with reduced\npre-target activity of saccade-related neurons in the frontal\neye field (Everling et al., 1999; Everling and Munoz, 2000)\nand superior colliculus (Everling et al., 1999),key regions in\nsaccade generation. Moreover, lower pre-target frontal eye\nBrain (2008)\nPage II of 15\nfield activity is correlated with increased saccadic latency\nand fewer antisaccade errors. Reduced preparatory neural\nactivity in response to the instruction to perform an\nantisaccade presumably makes it more difficult for activity\nrelated to the incorrect, but prepotent prosaccade to reach\nthe threshold for triggering an eye movement. However, the\nprice for this improved accuracy is that the activity\ngenerating the correct antisaccade also takes longer to\nreach threshold, resulting in prolonged saccadic latencies.\nThus, we hypothesize that the slowing of responses that\nfollow an antisaccade error (i.e. post-error slowing:\nNieuwenhuis et al., 2001) stems from an ACC error\nresponse that signals the frontal eye field to reduce its\npreparatory activity during the subsequent trial. This\nhypothesis is consistent with previous work demonstrating\nthat other aspects of trial history affect preparatory neural\nactivity in the frontal eye field during antisaccades\n(Manoach et al., 2007b). How might error signals be\nconveyed to frontal eye field? The use of outcomes to\ndynamically adjust responses has been attributed to ACC\nacting with lateral prefrontal cortex (Gehring and Knight,\n2000; Paus, 2001; Garavan et al., 2002) and lateral\nprefrontal cortex has been proposed to provide inhibitory\ninput to frontal eye field during antisaccades (DeSouza\net al., 2003). Thus, in ASD, aberrant communication\nbetween response evaluation in the ACC and regions\ninitiating compensatory adjustments, possibly lateral pre-\nfrontal cortex, could result in a failure to optimally reduce\npreparatory firing rates in frontal eye field in response to\na prior error. This reduced dynamic performance adjust-\nment could lead to faster responding and more errors.\nWe are presently testing this hypothesis using an anti-\nsaccade paradigm that gives rise to post-error slowing\n(Rabbitt, 1966) and will allow a more direct examination\nof compensatory behaviour and its supporting neural\ncircuitry. Unfortunately, although post-error slowing is\nseen when antisaccades are the only task (Polli et al., 2006)\nthe intermixed antisaccade and prosaccade paradigm\nemployed here gives rise to other inter-trial factors that\nalso affect latency (e.g. task-switching and prior antisac-\ncades, Cherkasova et al., 2002; Fecteau et al., 2004; Barton\net al., 2006; Manoach et al., 2007b) and may obscure the\neffects of a prior error. There is evidence of reduced post-\nerror slowing in adults with high functioning autism,\nhowever, from a previous study that employed a memory\nsearch task (Bogte et al., 2007). Generalizing beyond the\nocular motor system, failures of dynamic performance\nadjustment due to ACC dysfunction and dysconnectivity\nmay contribute to the rigid and perseverative behaviours\nthat characterize ASD.\nRepetitive behaviour scores in ASD were also associated\nwith reduced FA in the WM underlying left subgenual\nrACC. Subgenual rACC is part of a network that is thought\nto play an important role in generating autonomic\nresponses to motivationally salient stimuli, evaluating\ntheir significance in predicting reward and in using this\n\nPage 12 of 15\nBrain (2008)\ninformation to guide behaviour (Damasio et al., 1990;\nDrevets, 2000). An important consideration in interpreting\nthis relation of FA to repetition is that subgenual rACC\nregion was not functionally or structurally abnormal in this\nASD sample. This suggests that even normal variation in FA\nof the subgenual rACC may contribute to a tendency to\nrepeat unreinforced stimulus-response mappings. More\ngenerally, the relations we observed between behavioural\nrepetition and ACC function and structure may not be\nspecific to ASD. Accumulating evidence suggests that the\nthree symptom clusters that define autism-social\nimpair-\nment, communication deficits and restricted, repetitive\nbehaviour-arise\nfrom distinct genetic and cognitive\nmechanisms and may represent continuous traits in the\npopulation (for reviews see: Happe et al., 2006; London,\n2007). Previous studies have reported relations between\nindices of response monitoring and repetition in OCD\n(Gehring et al., 2000; Ursu et al., 2003) and in non-\nclinically ascertained samples of children and adults with\nobsessive-compulsive characteristics (Hajcak and Simons,\n2002; Santesso et al., 2006).\nOur findings also raise the question of whether the\nresponse monitoring abnormalities that we observed are\nspecific to ASD. Similar abnormalities have been reported\nin OCD (Maltby et al., 2005) and attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder (van Meel et al., 2007). While\nmethodological differences preclude a direct comparison\nof these findings, we previously studied patients with\nschizophrenia using the identical paradigm (Polli et al.,\n2008). Schizophrenia is also a neurodevelopmental disorder\nthat is characterized by rigid and perseverative behaviour,\nresponse monitoring abnormalities (Carter et al., 2001),\nreduced FA in ACC WM (Manoach et al., 2007a) and a\nconsistently elevated antisaccade error rate (Radant et al.,\n2007; Manoach et al. 2002). Although both schizophrenia\nand ASD samples made more antisaccade errors than\ncontrols, ASD participants performed correct trials faster\nand schizophrenia patients performed more slowly. While\nboth groups showed reduced discrimination between error\nand correct trials in the ACC, this occurred for different\nreasons. In ASD this reflected a hyperactive response to\ncorrect trials, while in schizophrenia it reflected a blunted\nACC response to errors, consistent with numerous previous\nreports (Laurens et al., 2003). These differences argue for\ndistinct behavioural and neural signatures of response\nmonitoring deficits in schizophrenia and ASD. These\nfindings, along with those of recent neuroimaging studies\nsuggesting genetic mediation of response monitoring\n(Fallgatter et al., 2004; Klein et al., 2007; Kramer et al.,\n2007), support the candidacy of neuroimaging-based\nindices of response monitoring as neurocognitive endophe-\nnotypes. Whether response monitoring abnormalities can\nbe distinguished in ASD, OCD and other neuropsychiatric\ndisorders, whether they are related to diagnosis or specific\ntraits, and whether they are also present in unaffected\nfamily members remains to be seen.\nK. N.Thakkar et al.\nSeveral additional limitations to and alternative inter-\npretations of our findings merit consideration. First, might\nthe hyperactive rACC response to correct antisaccades in\nASD reflect a less efficient response to conflict rather\nthan response monitoring? The ACC is thought to play a\nrole in detecting conflict and engaging cognitive control\nto resolve it (for review see: Carter and van Veen, 2007).\nAntisaccades involve a high degree of conflict as one must\nchoose between two competing responses and inhibit the\nprepotent one. Errors give rise to another type of conflict\nwhen the actual response is compared with the intended\none. Thus, both correct and erroneous antisaccades\nengender conflict. While it is not possible to entirely rule\nout the conflict explanation, several observations argue\nagainst it. If this rACC region were detecting conflict it\nshould respond to both correct and error trials. Instead,\ncontrols showed a significant response only to errors. In\naddition, the timing of the haemodynamic response to\ncorrect antisaccades in ASD, which started -4 s and peaked\nat -8 s (Fig. 3), argues for a role in response monitoring\nrather than successful conflict resolution. In this paradigm,\ndifferential fMRI activation for correct antisaccade versus\nprosaccade trials, including in dACC, presumably reflecting\nconflict detection, response inhibition and saccade genera-\ntion, peaks at -4s and is mostly gone by 8 s (Manoach\net al., 2007b; see also Polli et al., 2005, for a discussion\nof ACC regions involved in saccade generation versus\nresponse monitoring). Finally, it is dorsal rather than rACC\nactivation that is associated with engaging cognitive control\non correct high-conflict and error trials (Carter and van\nVeen, 2007).\nAn important limitation is that the small sample size of\nthe present study may have compromised our power to\ndetect additional group differences and relations of interest,\nparticularly in regions outside our a priori ACC regions of\ninterest for which more stringent multiple comparisons\ncorrections were applied. In spite of the relatively small\nsample size, our a priori hypotheses were confirmed.\nIn addition, four of our ASD participants were taking\nmedications that could affect ACC function. A re-analysis\nof the fMRI data with only unmedicated ASD participants,\nhowever, supported our main findings of significantly less\ndiscrimination between response outcomes in the rACC,\nand greater activation to correct trials. It is also important to\nnote that our sample was limited to high functioning adults\nwith ASD so it is not clear that our findings would generalize\nto lower functioning or younger samples. Although increased\nantisaccade error rates are seen in autism as early as ages 8-12\n(Luna et al., 2007), we limited our study to adults since\nsaccadic inhibition may not fully develop until late adoles-\ncence (Klein and Foerster, 2001) and larger samples would be\nnecessary to discriminate between the effects of diagnosis and\nthose due to normal development. Another limitation\nconcerns our interpretation of FA as reflecting connectivity.\nFA reflects the degree of directional coherence of water\ndiffusion in tissue and is, therefore, an indirect measure of\n\nAbnormal response monitoring in autism\nWM microstructure. While FA correlates with axon myelinat-\nion (Harsan et al., 2006), not all of its biophysical\ndeterminants are fully understood (Beaulieu, 2002). Thus, it\nis not possible to attribute FA differences or the relations we\nobserved to a particular WM property.\nIn summary, the present study reports hyperactive\nresponse monitoring in the rACC in ASD that is related\nto restricted, repetitive behaviour and is accompanied by\nreduced FA in the underlying white matter. This suggests a\nstructural correlate to abnormal function that may com-\npromise connectivity in the circuitry subserving response\nmonitoring. These findings suggest that structural and fun-\nctional abnormalities of the ACC compromise response\nmonitoring and contribute to behavioural repetition in\nASD. Impairments in evaluating and learning from errors\nmay lead to behaviour that is rigid and repetitive rather\nthan optimally guided by outcomes, and may compromise\nperformance across a wide range of tasks. Illuminating the\nneural basis and clinical significance of response monitoring\ndeficits in ASD represents a fruitful avenue for further\nresearch.\nSupplementary material\nSupplementary material is available at Brain online.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank Mark Vangel for statistical\nconsultation, Robert Levy, Kim Ono, Christopher Sherman\nand Jeremy Young for help with manuscript preparation,\nand Matt Cain and Jay Edelman for technical assistance.\nSome of these data were presented at the annual meeting\nof the Society for Neuroscience in Washington, DC, in\nNovember, 2005.
