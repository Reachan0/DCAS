  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 5 sessions / week, 4 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore taking this course, students are expected to have completed: Introduction to Experimental Biology and Communication (7.02), Genetics (7.03), and General Biochemistry (7.05).\n\nDescription\n\nIndividual research projects in Project Lab will center on using molecular genetics to examine the biology of the bacterium\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n, an opportunistic pathogen often found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Students will engage in independent projects to probe various aspects of\nP. aeruginosa\nphysiology such as antibiotic resistance, phase variation, toxin production, secondary metabolite production, twitching motility, swarming behaviors, and more. Projects will aim to discover the molecular basis for these processes using both classical and new, cutting-edge techniques. These include plasmid manipulation, genetic complementation, mutagenesis, PCR, DNA sequencing, enzyme assays, and gene expression studies.\n\nOverview\n\nThe course consists of these three key components: laboratory work, oral presentations, and writing requirements. Because communication is an especially important component of scientific research, this course aims to improve your written and oral communication skills. Research \"at the bench\" will occupy the bulk of your time; however, you are also responsible for making oral presentations to the class and for writing up your research results in a format suitable for publication in\nThe Journal of Bacteriology\n.\n\nLaboratory Work\n\nThe first two weeks of the course will be a Molecular Biology \"Boot Camp\" in which the whole class will conduct a short project designed to help master some basic techniques. Following that, students will pursue an independent research project with a partner. The instructors and TAs work with students to choose a project and will then coach each team through its execution over the course of the semester, including the initial planning, the design of individual experiments, data interpretation, and technical troubleshooting.\n\nOral Presentations\n\nOnce each week we will begin class with a group meeting during which we will discuss issues of general or specific concern, explain protocols, and plan experimental strategies. During these meetings you will have the opportunity to hone your presentation skills through progress reports, journal club, and other presentations.\n\nWriting Requirements\n\nWritten communication has been the standard for disseminating scientific achievements and new knowledge for centuries. Developing good scientific writing skills is thus a critical component of this course. You will be required to fulfill a number of writing assignments, culminating in a final paper (~15 pages) that describes your own research.\n\nReadings\n\nTo give you some background on how\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nacts\nin vitro\nand\nin vivo\n, a list of relevant journal articles is provided.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nGrading will be based on your performance in the areas summarized below. Although students in this course will typically work in groups of two, students are graded independently.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nExperimental design and interpretation, skill, effort, lab notebook and lab citizenship\n\n50%\n\nGroup meetings and oral presentations\n\n20%\n\nInterim writing assignments (3)\n\n10%\n\nFinal paper\n\n20%\n\nLab Hours and Attendance\n\nYou are expected to attend class every day during the regular lab hours. You will receive a lower grade in this class if you do not show up on time.\n\nYou may find a need to stay late on occasion. With a prior notice, the TAs can stick around so that students may complete the day's experiments. However, the TAs will not look favorably upon you if you need to work late because you did not arrive on time or wasted time during the normal hours. If this is repeatedly the case, it will affect your final grade. Occasionally you may need plates taken out of the incubator or cultures started over the weekend. A member of the teaching staff can do these things for you at their discretion. The more organized you are about your request the more likely we are to say yes (e.g. prepare tubes with medium for us and label them clearly). Under no circumstances will you be allowed to work in the lab when no member of teaching staff is present.\n\nMid-term Evaluation\n\nAt mid-term, we will hand out a written evaluation of your progress to date. The evaluation will give you an idea of your strengths and weaknesses. For some, the evaluation will be a \"wake up call\" which will identify deficiencies in experimental, technical, or communication skills. The grade will not be recorded; it serves to provide you with an opportunity to improve going into the second part of the term.",

Voltage applied at the ends of an\nagarose gel generates an electric field with a strength defined by the length of the gel and\nthe potential difference at the ends (V/cm). DNA molecules exposed to this electric field\nmigrate toward the anode (positive end) due to the negatively charged phosphates along\nthe DNA backbone. The migration velocity is limited by the frictional force imposed by\nthe gel matrix. While charge and/or size can affect the rate at which macromolecules will\npass through the gel, the charge to mass ratio is the same for DNA molecules of different\nlengths. It is the size of the DNA, therefore, that determines the rate at which it passes\nthrough the gel, thereby allowing an effective separation of DNA fragment-length\nmixtures by electrophoresis. To visualize the DNA, the gel is treated with ethidium\nbromide. This dye intercalates between the stacked bases of nucleic acids and fluoresces\nred-orange (560 nm) when illuminated with UV light (260 to 360 nm).\nReagents and materials:\n50 X TAE buffer (agarose gel running buffer)\nEthidium bromide 10 mg/ml (20,000x stock) - wear gloves when handling EtBr.\nSince it is a DNA-intercalating molecule, EtBr is a mutagen! Dispose of all tips etc in\nlabeled receptacle in fume hood.\n6X Gel loading buffer\nAgarose gel:\n1. To an Erlenmeyer flask, add agarose to an appropriate weight to volume (see below).\nYou will want the final gel to be about 8mm thick so calculate how much agar solution\nyou will need.\nAgarose (%)\nSize of fragment separated\n0.5\n15 kb to 30 kb\n0.7\n1 kb-12 kb\n1.0\n500 bp to 8 kb\n1.2\n400 bp to 5 kb\n1.5\n200 bp to 3 kb\n2. Add appropriate amount of 1X TAE to the flask. **Do not make your agarose in\nwater!** Bring slurry to a boil in a microwave (heat about 1.5 minute on high power),\nswirl, and repeat as necessary until no \"streaks\" or chunks remain.\n* Be careful with molten agar and agarose. It can boil over suddenly and cause\nnasty burns.\n\n7 . 1 3 F a l l 2 0 0 8\nP a g e | 2\n3. Once agarose is completely dissolved, add ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml; a 10,000 X\nstock) to a final concentration of 0.1μg/ml (WEAR GLOVES!). Swirl to mix.\n4. Pour molten agar into a gel box.\n5. The agar is completely set when it becomes opaque (< 20 min).\n6. If you prepare your gel ahead of time, wrap it in saran wrap and store it in the cold\nroom.\n7. Add the loading dye to your DNA samples to a final concentration of 1X.\n8. Load the gel. Remember to also load a molecular weight marker!!! See end of this\nprotocol for 1 kb and 100 bp molecular weight marker patterns.\n9. Run gel with an overlay of 1X TAE (about 5-8 mm deep above the gel) at 80-100V.\n10. The bromphenol blue in the loading dye will migrate with an apparent molecular\nweight of 500 bp and the xylene cyanol of 2 kb.\n11. When the gel has run far enough, so that your bands have clearly separated and you\ncan tell what size they are, take a picture of the gel.\nCutting out DNA band:\nTake the gel to the dark room and use a hand-held UV-light transluminator to visualize\nthe DNA bands. In order to minimize damage to the DNA, use a long-wave UV light for\nas short a time as possible. Make sure to use protective glasses during this\nprocedure since the UV light will burn your retina. Excise the desired band\nusing a razor blade. Place the band in an eppendorf tube. Take a picture of the gel without\nthe band in it to be sure the band is successfully recovered.\n\n100 bp DNA Ladder\nPage 2 of 3\nNote:\nDuring 2% agarose gel electrophoresis with tris\nacetate (pH 7.6) as the running buffer, bromophenol\nblue migrates near the 100-bp fragment. The 100-bp\nband migrates behind the bromophenol blue marker on\n6% polyacrylamide gels with tris-borate (pH 8.0) as\nthe running buffer.\nPart of the 600-bp band may migrate anomalously\nslowly in polyacrylamide gels (1,2,3). This band may\nappear as an extra band near or on top of the 700-bp\nband.\nReferences:\n1.\nHsieh, C., et al. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet. 225, 25.\n2.\nStellwagen, N.C.

The constructs and strains you are making will certainly be of use to the people in Profs. Laub and\nNewman's labs and the better you archive your materials, the easier it will be for someone to follow up with your work and credit you for it! In addition,\nby now you all now know that: 1) transforming a strain with a plasmid and verifying the plasmid is a procedure that takes several days and 2) cloning a\ngene is a procedure that can take several weeks. If after making these strains and plasmids you do not make an archival stock, the time and money you\nspent performing these tasks is essentially wasted. If those justifications aren't motivation enough for you, how well you maintain your archives will also\nbe a significant factor in your final grade! Thus, archiving the strain and plasmids you construct this term is an incredibly important part of your\nresponsibilities as a 7.13 student.\nBecause this is so important, we will check your archive periodically throughout the term. These dates will be announced later, but at this time we will\nask to see your strain and plasmid lists (use templates below, the first lines serve as an example of how to correctly fill out the information) and your\nfreezer boxes that contain the items on your lists. These archive boxes should be kept entirely separate from your \"everyday box\" or the box that\ncontains the things you use on a regular basis (you can get new freezer boxes in the cabinet by my office in 089).\nAt the end of the term you should be prepared to provide your archived strain and plasmid stocks and send her your complete strain and plasmid lists as\nwell as copies of your plasmid maps and sequence files via e-mail. Please add your names to the file name.

Preventing Vector Recircularization using Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase:\nAlkaline phosphatase catalyzes the removal of 5 phosphate groups from DNA, RNA,\nribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Since CIP-treated fragments lack the\n5 phosphoryl termini required by ligases, they cannot self-ligate (1). This property can be\nused to decrease the vector background in cloning strategies.\nDNA ligase requires that one of the two pieces of DNA to be joined have a 5'-phosphate\n(donor). Vector DNA cut with a single enzyme will have two 5'-phosphate ends and two\n3' hydroxyl ends. Since they are on the same molecule, there is nothing to stop these\nfrom rejoing during a ligation. In fact, this reaction will proceed quite well, since it is\nessentially unimolecular. In order to minimize this reaction and favor ligation of the\ninsert DNA, one can treat the digested vector DNA with Alkaline Phosphatase prior to\npurification. This enzyme will remove the 5'-phosphate groups. Since the insert will still\nhave 5'-phosphates, vector-insert ligation will occur but vector-vector ligation will not.\nThis procedure is also suggested when double-digesting a vector when the two cuts are\nextremely close. When the two sites are close, analysis by gel electrohoresis will not\nenable one to assess the extent that both enzymes have worked. If the DNA consists of a\npool of single and double cut DNA, the single cut DNA can easily religate if 5'-\nphosphate is present and a high background of vector religation may result, even if the\nvector is gel purified.\nApplications\n- Removing of 5 and 3 phosphoryl groups from nucleic acids\n- Preparing of templates for 5 end labeling\n- Preventing fragments from self ligating\n- Dephosphorylation of proteins\nReaction Buffer\n10X NEBuffer 3:[100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol\n(pH 7.9 @ 25°C)].

Purify DNA by gel purification immediately after step 3.\nNote\n1) Slightly lower activity may be observed in any reaction buffer containing a total salt\nconcentration of less than 50mM, under these conditions a 2-fold excess of CIP is\nrecommended.\n2) Since CIP treatment of vectors is the final vector preparation step before ligation it is\nbetter to gel purify the vector than use the PCR/enzyme clean up kit after CIP treatment.\nThis will ensure that the cut vector is separated away from any uncut vector as well as\n\n7 . 1 3 F a l l 2 0 0 8\nP a g e | 2\nremoving the CIP.

In the\n1990s the microscope has continued to be a powerful tool for biologists. We can watch\nsubnanometer movements of cells or single molecules in cells with digital CCD cameras,\nmeasure piconewton forces exerted by motor proteins with optical traps formed by IR\nlasers, reconstruct the 3D structure of a cell using powerful image analysis algorithms,\nfollow the chemical changes in a cell using fluorescent dyes, or determine the precise\nlocation of various gene products that are tagged with antibodies, enzymes, or light\nemitting (fluorescent or luminescent) proteins. The dynamics of cellular responses\ncaptured in a microscope tell us about the lifestyle and life span of a structure. The\npurpose of the microscope module in Project Lab is to familiarize you with the operation\nof a state-of-the-art digital microscope. The microscope system consists of a Nikon\nOptiphot 2 microscope, a Photometric ImagePoint CCD camera, and a MacIntosh G3\nPowerPC computer for data acquisition and image analysis. With this system, you will\nobserve the dynamics of fluorescently tagged proteins in cultured CAD cells. The manual\nwill illustrate how to set up a microscope for imaging with phase contrast, differential\ninterference contrast, or fluorescence optics, and how to analyze the images using Spot or\nPhotoshop software packages.\nParts of a Microscope\nThe microscope is divided into three parts: an illumination system, an optical system, and\nan image viewing system. The illumination system consists of the lamp, shutters, filters,\ncondenser, and field diaphragm. These elements deliver and focus the light onto the\nspecimen. The optical system consists of the objective lens and various prisms, filters,\nand magnifiers. They focus the image onto the oculars or camera. A CCD camera\ncaptures a digital image and the image is stored on a computer.\nThe Microscope\nA microscope consists of an illumination system, an imaging system, and a detecting\nsystem. These systems focus light onto a specimen, collect light from the specimen, and\nrecord the magnified image. The specimen is mounted on a transparent glass slide and\npositioned on the movable stage of the microscope. Light from a bright source is focused\nby the collector and condenser lenses onto the specimen. Light transmitted through the\nspecimen is collected by the objective lens and focused on the focal plane of the objective\nlens, creating a magnified image of the specimen. The image is then further magnified\nand projected by the ocular lens (eyepiece) onto a detector, either the human eye, a piece\nof photographic film, or imaging chip of a CCD camera. The condenser diaphragm and\nthe other apertures restrict the amount of light entering or leaving a lens.\nThe total magnification is a product of the magnification of the individual lenses: if the\nobjective lens magnifies 100-fold (100X) and the ocular lens magnifies 10X, the final\nmagnification recorded (by the eye) will be 1000X. The magnification recorded on the\nfilm depends on what lenses are present in the path to the camera (and not on the ocular\nlens). The resolution of a microscope lens is the minimum distance, D, between two\n\n7 . 1 3 F a l l 2 0 0 8\nP a g e | 2\ndistinguishable objects that can be resolved from each other: the smaller the value of D,\nthe better the resolution. D depends on three parameters: the angular aperture, a, or\nhalfangle of light entering the lens from the specimen; the refractive index, N, of the air\nor fluid medium between the specimen and the objective lens; and the wavelength, l, of\nincident light:\nDecreasing the value of l or increasing either N or a will decrease the value of D and thus\nimprove the resolution.\n1) The angular aperture depends on the width of the objective lens and its distance\nfrom the specimen. Moving the objective lens closer to the specimen will increase\nsin a and reduce D.\n2) The refractive index measures the degree to which a medium bends a light ray\nthat passes through it; the refractive index of air is defined as N = 1.0. One way to\ndecrease D is to use immersion oil as the medium between the specimen and the\nobjective lens. Since the refractive index of such oils is 1.5, the resolution will be\nimproved 1.5-fold.\n3) The shorter the wavelength of incident light, the lower the value of D and better\nthe resolution.\nUnder the best conditions, with violet light (wavelength, l = 0.4 μm) and N sin a of 1.4, a\nlimit of resolution of just under 0.2 μm can theoretically be obtained under the light\nmicroscope.\nTypes of Light Microscopy\nA typical living cell is transparent, thus nearly invisible to the eye. To \"see\" a cell we\nmust either stain the specimen with a colored or fluorescent dye (described in sample\npreparation) or manipulate light so that interference caused by the cell generates contrast.\nTransmitted light microscopy\n- Bright field\n- Phase Contrast\n- DIC/Nomarski\nEpifluorescence light microscopy\nBright field microscopy can only be used to view stained specimens since light is usually\nnot absorbed by unstained specimen. Histological stains such as hemotoxilin and eosin\nare used to image cytoplasmic and nuclear structures in a cell. Because enzymes within\ncells can remain active under precisely controlled conditions, we can take advantage of\nthis activity to locate the enzymes within the cell. This is done by adding a substrate\nwhich yields a colored product when the enzyme acts on it. However, without artificial\nmeans to generate color contrast, brightfield microscopy has limited usefulness.\nPhase-contrast microscopy is used to give detailed views of transparent, live, unstained\ncells and tissues. The brightness in a region of the sample depends on the refractive index\nof that region. Because light moves more slowly in a medium of higher refractive index,\n\n7 . 1 3 F a l l 2 0 0 8\nP a g e | 3\nthe part of a light wave that passes through a specimen will be refracted and consequently\nwill be out of phase with the part of the wave that does not pass through the specimen.\nWhen the two parts of the light wave are recombined, the resultant light will be brighter\nif they are in phase and less bright if they are out of phase. Thus, dense or thick regions\nof the cell will appear darker than their surroundings.\nIncident light passes through an annular diaphragm, which focuses a ring of light on the\nsample. Light that passes unobstructed through the specimen is focused by the objective\nlens onto the phase-retarding gray phase ring (on the surface of the objective lens), which\nabsorbs some of the direct light and alters its phase by one-quarter of a wavelength. If a\nspecimen refracts or diffracts the light, the phase of some light waves is altered and the\nlight waves are redirected through the thin, clear region of the phase plate. The refracted\nand unrefracted light are recombined at the image plane. Structures within a cell are\nhighlighted by the light and dark fringes generated by constructive and destructive\ninterference.\nNomarski, or Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy, generates a three-\ndimensional or \"relief\" image. The \"shadow\" represents a difference in refractive index\nrather than literal thickness. Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used\nfully open, thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution. A prism splits\na beam of incident polarized light into two parallel beams: one passes through one region\nof a specimen and the other passes through a closely adjacent region. After passage\nthrough the specimen, the beams are reunited by a similar prism in the objective. In a\nhomogeneous specimen, there is no difference between the two beams, and no contrast is\ngenerated. However, near a refractive boundary (e.g. a nucleus within the cytoplasm), the\npath difference between the normal and the reference beam will generate a relief. A path\ndifference of 0 results in no transmitted light; maximum light is transmitted if the path\ndifference is half the wavelength. By these means, different regions of the specimen\nappear bright or less bright in contrast to the mid-gray background.\nPhase-contrast microscope is useful in examining the structure and movement of larger\norganelles, such as the nucleus and mitochondria, in live cultured cells. The disadvantage\nof this technique is that it is suitable for observing only single cells or thin cell layers.\nThe Nomarski technique, in contrast, only defines the outlines of the large organelles;\nhowever, thicker objects can be observed by combining this technique with optical\nsectioning.\nFluorescence microscopy relies on emission of light by the sample when excited by\nhigher wavelength light.\nUnlike a transmitted light microscope, a fluorescence\nmicroscope illuminates the sample through the objective lens (epi-illumination). A\nspecific wavelength of ultraviolet light from a mercury lamp source is selected by the\nexcitation filter. The excitation radiation is reflected by the dichromatic filter and focused\nby the objective lens onto the sample. Fluorescent molecules in the sample absorb the\nlight and emit light (fluoresce) at a longer wavelength. This light is collected and focused\nby the objective lens. An emission filter blocks any residual excitation light. Because\nmost of the excitation light passes through the specimen, epi-illumination allows us to\n\n7 . 1 3 F a l l 2 0 0 8\nP a g e | 4\ndetect very low levels of fluorescent light, making possible the detection of single\nmolecules.\nInstructions for using the microscope and video camera with Spot software\nCleaning the lenses\nThe optical cleanliness of the microscope lenses must be scrupulously maintained to\nobtain clear, high contrast images. If the image appears blurred, low contrast, or spotty,\nthen the system is dirty. Furthermore, dirt on the surfaces of lenses is a sure-fire method\nto scratch the lens. Most dirt is found on the microscope slide or cover slip. If you see\ndiffuse spots or circles when the sample is in focus, then check the glass surface of the\ncover slip or microscope slide for fingerprints, immersion oil, or dried tissue culture\nmedia. If the spot moves, then check for air bubbles in the oil or in the liquid surrounding\nthe specimen.\n- Water or grease on the objective lens will cause the image to appear dull or of low\ncontrast and blurry at best focus. Clean the objective lens as described below.\n- Dirt in the plane of focus is usually on the surface of the field diagram lens (or on\na glass surface in the same focal plane).\n- Check the surface of the eyepiece. Grease from eyelashes will obscure the image\nwhen viewed through the oculars but not when viewed through the CCD camera.\nThe objective lenses should be routinely checked for cleanliness before use. Be extremely\ncareful to handle the objectives by their barrel and do not touch the lens surface with\nfingers. Dropping an objective will destroy it. (And lenses are VERY expensive)\n1. Moisten a piece of lens paper and gently touch it to the lens surface. Repeat with a\ndry piece of paper.\n2. Grease and immersion oil may be removed by moistening a piece of lens paper\nwith water, and gently touching the lens surface. Repeat with a dry piece of paper.\n3. If still dirty, repeat 2 with ethanol; then repeat again with water. Notify the\ninstructor.\nTurning on the Microscope\nAlways turn on the mercury lamp first because arcing of the bulb generates an\nelectromagnetic pulse (EMP) which can blow the computer. A corollary to this rule is to\nturn on the computer last. If you want to view the image using the CCD camera or\ncapture the image onto the computer, then you must turn on the camera, monitor, and\ncomputer.\n1. mercury lamp (for fluorescence microscopy, ALWAYS TURN ON FIRST)\n2. Power strip: This will give power for microscope illumination (in the back, on the\nright) and the CCD camera\n3. Computer (turn on LAST) When turning things off, turn off the computer first,\nthen power strip and then UV lamp. Please don't forget the power strip.\nOtherwise, the video camera is still on.\nFinding and Focusing\nA. Start with the 10X objective and put your cells in focus.\n\n7 . 1 3 F a l l 2 0 0 8\nP a g e | 5\n- Carefully rack down the stage. The objectives should be swung out to the side.\n- Place specimen into the specimen holder.\n- Swing the objective of choice into place.\nNOTE: The easiest way to find your cells is by using DAPI fluorescence\nOnce you have the cells in focus, just close the shutter to the UV lamp and turn up the\nwhite light. If you still can't see them, adjust contrast. The easiest way to see cells under\nwhite light is by using the following filter combination (these apply to PHASE objectives\nonly):\n- DIC filter beneath stage pushed in; DIC filter near eyepieces pulled out\n- Use Phase 3 filter in dial or Phase 4 in dial (depending on what objective you use)\n- May need to increase illumination\nB. Set up for Koehler illumination. For optimal imaging, the microscope lens and\nspecimen slide must be clean and the system set up for Koehler illumination. Under these\nconditions, the specimen is brought into focus and the condenser lens is aligned with the\nobjective lens and positioned to fully illuminate the specimen.\n- Adjust the condenser to illuminate the specimen with an optimal amount of light\n- Adjust the intensity of the lamp with the slider controls at the front of the\nmicroscope base. A middle setting should be adequate for most applications.\n- Close the aperture (under stage) completely.\n- Bring the aperture leaves into focus (a decagon image) by using the condenser\nfocus (knob below stage on left).\n- Align the decagon to the center with the alignment knobs. Centering can be\nchecked by opening up the field diagram. This step centers the condenser lens\nwithin the optical and illumination path.\n- Open up the condenser such that the edges of the decagon are just inside the edge\nof the tube. This ensures the specimen is fully illuminated but prevents excess\nillumination.\nNOTE: Every time you change the objective lens, the condenser may be put out of focus.\nYou may need to focus the condenser each time you change the objective.\nC. To use higher magnification, just rotate the appropriate objective into place. If the\nobjective requires oil, then place a drop of oil on top of the specimen before placing the\nobjective. Remove air bubbles from the oil. Be careful not to get oil on dry (<60X)\nobjectives.\nD. To use fluorescence:\n- DIC filter in condenser (beneath stage) pushed in; DIC filter near eyepieces pulled\nout (otherwise it will cut the fluorescence signal). It doesn't matter about anything\nbelow the stage under fluorescence, since all illumination is coming from above\nthrough the objective.\n- Dim white light and open shutter to UV lamp\nWhen looking through phase objectives (10x, 40x, 100x), the DIC filters should not be\nengaged (filter ring to ph3 or ph4, not DIC 1.4).\n\n7 . 1 3 F a l l 2 0 0 8\nP a g e | 6\n**The GFP fluorescence is the most important feature of your cells, so you should focus\non that, then acquire all three of your images (i.e., GFP, DAPI, DIC) in the same plane of\nfocus.\nTo adjust illumination from the mercury bulb: slide in/out the neutral density (ND) filters\nin the back.

You do not\nnecessarily have to complete your research project, but you do need to demonstrate a basic level\nof competence and put forth a genuine effort to extend the research as far as possible. In\naddition, we do not expect that all your experiments will be successful, but we do expect that you\nwill have carried them out in a rigorous, well-controlled, and well-documented manner. Not\neveryone enters this course with the same level of laboratory research experience. The staff\nrecognizes this and encourages you to \"make the most\" of your own skills. Your effort to expand\nyour knowledge beyond the immediate need of the experimentation will be reflected favorably in\nthis portion of the grade. Also, you are expected to demonstrate good \"team effort\" by not only\nworking with your teammates to move the project forward but also by being a good lab citizen.\nThis means that you should be vigilant about doing the lab jobs that will be assigned to you and\nabout cleaning up after yourself when using common areas. Everyone is expected to carry his or\nher share of the burden.\nYou must keep a lab notebook. The notebook is very important as it is key to good experimental\npractice. Each lab partner should keep his or her own notebook, which will eventually contain all\nthe data collected by the whole team. In this way each partner can consider the results\nindependently.\nThe notebook should be a complete record of all the experiments as they were actually\nperformed. A good notebook will enable someone to reconstruct, long after the fact, exactly what\nwas done and why. In addition, you will derive both the Material and Methods section and the\nResults section of your final papers from the records kept in your notebook. Thus, it is essential\nto get in the habit of keeping a good record from the beginning.\nLab notebooks should be bound with numbered pages. In the notebook you should write down,\nas you go, what was actually done. Experimental results, tables, graphs, and photographs should\nbe written directly in your notebook or taped to the pages for a permanent record. Your notebook\nshould minimally include the information below and further, points 1-3 should be done before\nyou begin your experiment:\n1. Table of contents. Leave extra pages at the beginning of the notebook for a table of\ncontents, which you'll add as you go along. The table of contents should have a short\ntitle of each experiment, numbered and dated.\n2. A short summary of the reasoning for each experiment. Often a single sentence will\nsuffice. It is also very important to include a summary of the method you will use\nand a detailed plan for how you expect the experiment to proceed. Sketches of the\nprocedure may be very helpful in this regard as visualizing the physical steps\nrequired to complete the experiment ahead of time will help things proceed more\nsmoothly during the experiment and help you get out of lab on time. Thorough\npreparation of this type is *especially* critical if this is the first time you will be\nperforming a procedure.\n3. All the relevant information about the preparation of the experiment. Much of this\ncan be accomplished by suitable cross references to previous experiments. The first\n\ntime a solution is introduced, its origin should be noted. If a component or method is\nused for the first time, then it should be described in detail. The same applies to\nbacterial strains, plasmids, etc.\n4. The actual series of events, as performed. Especially important here are the actual\ntimes of incubation (as opposed to what was planned), any changes in procedure,\nany unusual observations made, etc. Writing down what actually happened can make\nit possible to interpret an experiment even though many mistakes were made.\n5. The results. Include raw data in the form in which it was collected. For example,\nrecord the actual number of colonies found, as well as the cell concentration\ncalculated from this number. A brief summary of the results and interpretation will\nalso be helpful when reviewing the data at a later date.\nThe main point is that it is unwise to rely solely on memory. After acquiring some experience,\nyou may want to know something about an early experiment which did not seem important at the\ntime. If you are in the habit of writing things as you go along, the chance of being able to learn\nfrom the early experiments is much greater. A good notebook will also help the instructors to\nhelp you troubleshoot experiments. The TAs will check the notebooks for completeness\nperiodically. They must be current. You are responsible for having your previous day's entries\ncompleted every day."

The majority of these mutants are in the fur gene. In Pseudomonas, Fur is\nessential for aerobic growth, so any mutants isolated are point mutations, rather than knockouts.\nMedia\nLB\n1. Add 25 g LB to 1 L deionized water. For plates, add 15 g bacto agar.\n2. Autoclave for 35 min on the fluid cycle.\n3. Let cool, then add required antibiotic for selective media. If making plates, pour into petri dishes, let\nsolidify, and refrigerate.\nManganese plates:\n2 g Tryptone\n1.2 g NaCl\n10mM MnCl2\n7.5 g agar\n500 ml deionized water\nAutoclave and cool to 50oC, then add\n50 uM desferral (desferroxamine) (make and filter sterilize a 25 mM stock solution. Use 2 ul/ml)\nThese plates must be made fresh - use within a week.\nBHI\nAdd 37 g BHI to 1 L water. For plates, add 15 g bacto agar.\nAutoclave for 35 min on liquid cycle.\nProtocol\n1. Grow liquid LB culture of wt PA-14 overnight.\n2. Dilute 1:10 and plate 25 μl onto manganese selection plates. You may want to play with the\nconcentrations of cells plated to achieve optimal results.\n3. Wrap plates in parafilm and incubate at 37oC for 1-2 days.\n4. If resulting colonies are well spaced on the plate, stamp to low and high iron CAS plates (see\nposted protocol), and to a BHI plate. If the colonies are close together, pick each one with a\nsterile stick and transfer to low and high iron CAS plates and a BHI plate. Be sure to spot a\ncolony of wt PA-14 onto each plate as a control. If stamping, be sure to mark the orientation of\nthe plates, so you can identify colonies.\n5. Incubate at 30oC overnight.\n6. Screen for mutants based on the pictures provided in the CAS medium protocol.\nBased on PA14 genome, design primers to amplify and sequence the Fur gene to determine the nature of\nthe mutation in the putative fur mutants you identify."
