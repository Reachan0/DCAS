  "course_description": "This class provides an introduction to quantitative models and qualitative frameworks for studying complex engineering systems. Also taught is the art of abstracting a complex system into a model for purposes of analysis and design while dealing with complexity, emergent behavior, stochasticity, non-linearities and the requirements of many stakeholders with divergent objectives. The successful completion of the class requires a semester-long class project that deals with critical contemporary issues which require an integrative, interdisciplinary approach using the above models and frameworks.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Overview\n\nESD.04J / 1.041J teaches\nsystems thinking\nthrough\na class-wide system design project\n, conducted in a complex technical environment and challenging societal context.\n\nESD.04J / 1.041J, through lectures and recitation exercises, teaches systems thinking concepts and how one goes about conceiving and approaching complex system design problems. These learnings are then utilized by students as they address a major system design project working as a class-wide team.\n\nLearnings\n\nSystems thinking as an integrative holistic approach to problem solving\n\nBasic ideas of design -- making good choices among alternatives as a fundamental of engineering\n\nAbstracting a complex technical system into quantitative models and/or qualitative frameworks that represent that system\n\nUsing those models and frameworks to reach effective design decisions\n\nCreating a strategy for implementing design decisions\n\nIdentifying the key system stakeholders and balancing their diverse interests\n\nOrganizing a set of individuals into an effective consulting team\n\nThe class project for Spring 2007 is concerned with\ndesigning a system for transporting and storing spent nuclear fuel (SNF)\n. This is an important problem in contemporary society. Nuclear power plants and research facilities around the United States have been producing SNF -- as a byproduct of the production of electric power -- a quite toxic substance, for some years. Until now, most SNF has been \"temporarily\" stored on site at the nuclear facilities. The nuclear power plant operators want that material removed. The current plan is to relocate it from about 130 sites around the country to a below-ground repository, thought to be geologically stable, at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.\n\nMany questions arise as one considers how to proceed. Is it better to move this spent nuclear fuel to Yucca Mountain and store it below ground, or continue to store it on site at the nuclear plants or at other dedicated facilities? Are there feasible means of storing it on site? What are the relative risks of the different options? How does terrorism enter into our design considerations in the post-9/11 era? If we do choose to transport SNF, what mode of transportation should be used and what operating practices are appropriate? Who are the various stakeholders in this issue and how are they differentially affected by various decisions? Who benefits and who pays in the implementation of various strategic alternatives?\n\nThose are but several of the\nspecific\nquestions one might consider in this system design project. But we will also consider\nthe broader context of U.S. energy and environmental policy\n. Design decisions we make will bear directly on the viability of nuclear energy as a way of meeting the U.S.'s energy needs. And there are environmental issues as well. Nuclear power can be produced without generation of further greenhouse gases, which has implications for global climate change. At the same time, many are concerned with the safety and environmental risks of nuclear power generation.\n\nESD.04J / 1.041J will address this complex system design question. We will conceptualize and structure the salient issues and move toward developing design alternatives using systems thinking principles, which are critical for understanding and approaching complex sociotechnical systems of the type described here.\n\nThis class is appropriate for and accessible to MIT undergraduates, typically juniors and seniors. Some graduate students, especially those interested in an introduction to systems thinking, will find the subject of value as well.\n\nStudent work will include various readings and assignments intended to build strength in the fundamentals of systems thinking. A major share of student effort will be embodied in their contribution to the class-wide system design project described above. This includes conceptualization of the key issues, development of strategic alternatives, and ultimately recommendations for a system design. The class will produce an integrated report reflecting its findings and will be asked to present these findings in an oral report as well. So, in addition to learnings in systems thinking and design applied in a complex technical and social environment, students will gain experience in writing and presentation skills, which are needed to succeed in contemporary organizations.\n\nStudent Work\n\nWork expected of students is of several kinds:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nWritten assignments\n\n35%\n\nProject work\n\n45%\n\nClass participation\n\n5%\n\nMidterm examination\n\n15%\n\nAlso, reading will be assigned to provide background for the lecture material, the midterm exam and for the project.\n\nAcademic Honesty and Performance Policy\n\nThe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Engineering Systems Division adhere to the strictest standards of academic honesty. An important aspect of achieving these standards is to be sure that students are aware of expectations of faculty as regards academic honesty. This statement states the faculty's expectations in ESD.04J / 1.041J.\n\nAssignments\n\nAssignments performed by students for submission have a dual purpose. They are intended as educational devices, including the teaching of skills such as working in teams. They are also evaluation tools for the faculty in judging the quality of performance of individual students. Our policies are intended to balance these two purposes and, unless otherwise stated, these policies apply to all assignments.\n\nStudents can work together to conceptualize general approaches to assignments. However, unless otherwise specified for a particular assignment, the work you submit should be done completely on your own. This includes text, numerical calculations, mathematical derivations, diagrams, graphs, computer programs and output.\n\nThis class has group work on project-related activities. Of course, this work is to be done in collaboration with your group mates. It is important that everyone on the group does their fair share of the work. The group collectively should take the responsibility to assure that. Also, each individual has an obligation to carry his or her part of the load in a timely fashion so that the group work does not suffer.\n\nReference any written source or website you use in your submission.\n\nIn-class Exams\n\nAll work on in-class exams should be performed only by you. Materials you can bring into the examination will be specified by the faculty for each exam.\n\nIf you have any questions about how these policies relate to a specific situation, you should speak to Professor Sussman.\n\nRecommended Citation\n\nFor any use or distribution of these materials, please cite as follows:\n\nJoseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J / 1.041J / ESD.01J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems / Engineering System Design, Spring 2007.

Benefit Cost Analysis. Applications, insights, drawbacks.\n\nQuestions\nIn Parts 1 and 2 you are expected to base your answers only on the data given in the\nassignment. Note that these are stylized for simplicity. In Part 3 you should use the\nknowledge from the class discussion and the readings along with your own reasoning to\nanswer the questions.\n\nSystem Description\n\nWe will consider a simplified situation of the SNF transportation and storage CLIOS\nSystem as shown in Figure 1. There are 6 sites where SNF is currently stored numbered\nfrom 1 to 6 and marked as grey triangles on the map. There are two proposals for storing\nthe fuel: (i) using a single centralized long-term facility (Marked X), or (ii) using two\nshorter-term smaller centralized facilities marked A and B. Finding acceptable sites for\nthis use was hard and their position currently satisfies both political and scientific\nconstraints for the anticipated length of storage. As a result identifying other potential\nareas or routes is not an alternative at this point. The transportation of SNF is expected to\nbe completed within 10 years. SNF can be transported either by rail OR by truck - i.e. no\nhybrid transportation solutions can be implemented.\n\nTable 1 displays information about the network routes that have already been found to\nprovide the minimum exposure of general population while SNF is en route.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

(SNF transport is expensive!)\n\nFrom historical observations, the accident probabilities for the two modes have been\nestablished. For intercity travel the accident probability for truck is P\n= 10-6\ntruck_accident\nper\ntruck-mile while the corresponding probability for trains is Ptrain_accident = 10-7 per train-\nmile. For urban travel this probability is doubled, because of traffic volumes, higher\nnumber of railroad crossings etc.\n\nIf an accident happens, then the probability of a significant leakage of radioactive\nmaterial has been calculated based on drop and puncture test performance to be on\naverage Prelease = 10-4 for each container carried. Container leakage in a given incident is\nindependent of whether other containers have leaked or not. We assume that the\nconsequences (health effects and restoration work) are the same if one or more containers\nleak in the same accident.\n\nAll containers carrying SNF will be equipped with tracking equipment that notifies the\nemergency response teams if it senses an accident. The probability that the GPS is\naffected by the accident and does not signal is PGPS_failure = 10-2. If the system does not fail\nthen the emergency response teams can arrive at the accident site early enough to prevent\nsevere contamination with a probability of Pmild_ER = 0.7. If they arrive late, Pmild_ER = 0.2.\n\nThe costs for decontamination and toll on economic and population health have been\nestimated on an approximate basis and shown on Table 3.\n\nTable 3 Event Costs\nEvent\nCosts\nUrban Mild\n$100M*(S/100.000)2\nUrban Severe $1B*(S/100.000)3\nRural Mild\n$10M\nRural Severe\n$100M\nwhere S is the urban area population size.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

Identify the solution space (bundles of strategic alternatives) implied by the\nproblem formulation.\n2. For the bundles of strategic alternatives you identified, calculate (or identify from\nthe problem description) the following data for operation of the project for 1 year:\na. Expected value of number of accidents for rural and urban settings.\nb. Probability of leak if an accident happens\nc. Probability of GPS failure if an accident happens\n3. Now you are ready to provide an event tree for each bundle to aid your\ncalculations of end probabilities.\n4. Using the event trees, calculate the end probabilities for having zero incidents,\nmild incidents, or severe incidents. What are the expected values of their costs?\n5. All else being equal which combination of storage site and transportation mode\nwould you recommend? Does your answer change if you take transportation cost\ninto account?\n6. A research fund has been designated to improve reliability of the SNF transport.\nYou are asked to choose how much money to allocate in increasing the reliability\nby one order of magnitude of the container or of the GPS unit. Assuming that any\nchanges do not impact production costs, which of the two would be your top\npriority? How much money would you be willing to invest in it?\n\nThe use of a spreadsheet like Excel is highly recommended. You could also use decision\nanalysis software e.g. the evaluation version of TreeAge or the Palisade PrecisionTree to\ndraft the event trees but this is not necessary for completing the assignment and may\nactually delay your work.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

To calculate the expected value of the number of accidents occurring, we multiply the\nnumber of miles traveled by the probability of accident per mile. This means that we need\nto calculate total loads and total miles for each bundle and distinguish whether they go\nthrough a rural or an urban setting since the accident probabilities differ. This is done in\nthe attached spreadsheet in detail.\n\nTable SOL1 summarizes these calculations per bundle.\n\nTable SOL1: Vehicle-miles traveled and Expected Values of Accidents for all bundles in Urban and\nRural settings.\nBundle\nRural\nUrban\nEV(Rural\nEV(Urban\nvehicle-miles vehicle-\naccident)\naccident)\nmiles\nTemp+rail\n24.775\n1.410\n2.48%\n0.282%\nTemp+truck\n500.800\n28.200\n501%\n56.4%\nPerm+rail\n+214.600*\n21.5%\n14.1%\nPerm+truck\n+3.889.000*\n141.000\n3890%\n282%\n*in addition to the temp solution results\n\nThis means that for the truck bundles, based on the probabilities per vehicle-mile as\noffered in the problem description some type of accident is inevitable.

Since it is assumed that each individual containers\nprobability to leak is 10-4 and is independent of what the rest do, this means that carrying\n20 containers will increase the probability of at least one leak. Since we assumed that the\nimpact of an incident is not dependent on the number of containers that leaked there is no\nneed to calculate the probabilities of higher order incidents (at least two containers\nleaking etc. which would have been the case otherwise).\nThe way to calculate this probability is the following. The probability of a container not\nleaking is (1-10-4). The probability of twenty containers not leaking is (1-10-4)20 . So the\nprobability of at least one leaking will be: 1- (1-10-4)20 = 0.002.\n\n2c.\n\nThe same thinking applies for calculating the probability of the GPS/notification device\nfailure which for trucks would be simply 0.01. For rail we need at least one functioning\nGPS device to send the signal. Since a device is fitted in each container the probability\nthat all fail at the same incident is (0.01)20 which for all practical purposes is 0.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

The probability of an event occurring is the\nproduct of probabilities of the events that it is dependent on. These are shown as blue\nnumbers above the end-node sign (blue triangle).\n\nThe expected values of the event costs are given by multiplying the probability of an\nevent with the cost it would incur if it actually happened.\n\nFor rural accidents, the clean-up cost of the events of mild and severe accidents have\nalready been given by the problem description.\n\nCalculating the costs of urban clean-up is a little more nuanced since it is dependent on\nthe population and the relative frequency of each population size. As a first step we\ncalculate the clean-up costs for each city as shown in the table below:\n\nTABLE SOL 2\nMild\nSevere\n\nincident\nIncident\nMild incident\nSevere Incident\nNumber\n\nof\nClean-up cost per city\nWeighted costs\nRoute\nCities\nPopulation\n(in $M)\n1A\n300,000.0\n900.0\n27,000.0\n82.98\n2489.36\n2A\n100,000.0\n100.0\n1,000.0\n31.91\n319.15\n3A\n50,000.0\n25.0\n125.0\n4.08\n20.39\n4B\n75,000.0\n56.3\n421.9\n5.98\n44.88\n5B\n50,000.0\n25.0\n125.0\n3.55\n17.73\n6B\n1,000,000.0\n10,000.0\n1,000,000.0\n1773.05\n177304.96\nTotal for Temp bundles\n1901.55\n180196.48\nBA\n100,000.0\n100.0\n1,000.0\n28.37\n283.69\nAX\n50,000.0\n25.0\n125.0\n17.91\n89.54\nTotal for Perm bundles\n46.28\n373.22\n\nThe second step is to weigh the cost calculated for each population size with the ratio of\nthe number of miles that go through these cities over the total number of urban miles as\nshown in the last two columns of the table.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

To that end, we ask you to provide for the next\nclass the following information:\n\n1. Your resume.\n2. Your statement of interests relative to this class. Here we suggest in a paragraph\nor two, certainly no more than half a page, to discuss what you hope to learn from\nthis class and how it relates to your longer-term professional interests. We\nrecognize you have only seen the syllabus and heard one lecture, but nonetheless\nit would be of value to the teaching staff to understand what you would expect\nyour learnings to be.\n3. This is a class about \"complex systems\". We ask you to identify and briefly\ndiscuss a \"complex system\" with which you have had personal experience, and\nfor which you have had some responsibility for improving. Please describe this\nsystem, how you decided what steps were appropriate to improve it, and the\nprocess by which you actually implemented those improvements - to scale this\nfor you, we're thinking about perhaps a page and certainly no more than two\npages.\n\nThis exercise--read by the teaching staff but ungraded--will give us some sense of the\ninterests and experiences of the students. It will allow us to begin to tailor the exercises to\ncome, especially the term of the semester-long class-wide project--and begin to get you\ninvolved in systems thinking.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

SUSSMAN\n\n3-1-8, U (SPRING)\nPROJECT ASSIGNMENT #1 (P1)\n12 POINTS\nDISTRIBUTED THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2007\nDUE MONDAY, MARCH 5, 2007\nInitial Representation of the SNF System\nGrouping\nFor this assignment we will form groups of at least 4 students. The groups are relatively\narbitrary although we have made an attempt at intellectual diversity. See the appendix for\nthe team assignments.\nAssignment Background\nThe CEO of your consulting firm is considering participating in a bid for a project that is\nrelated to Spent Nuclear Fuel management policy. The problem details have not been\nclarified yet a so she wants her team (you!!) to be prepared with a system-wide\nunderstanding of the issues involved.\nThe firm is known for its innovative recommendations that are associated with out-of\nthe-box thinking combined with a well-founded understanding of the issues at hand. In an\neffort to enhance their performance and systematize their work the CEO has decided to\n\"test-drive\" the CLIOS Process for this project. She has read the CLIOS Process user's\nguide that you will have but has no other prior experience with it.\nAssignment Statement\nGiven the unknown nature of the actual contract your team should have an initial meeting\nor two to get organized. Each team will have a VP in the consulting firm (aka a member\nof the class instructing staff) as a mentor. You should plan on meeting with your mentor\nno later than Wednesday, Feb 28. You need to take the initiative to arrange that meeting.\nWe expect you will choose to organize yourself into two sub-teams to look into two\naspects of the SNF case (described below), but if you want to organize yourself some\nother way, that's fine too. One ground rule: you should strive for equitable distribution of\nwork.\nThe two major tasks are 1) a first order representation of the Spent Nuclear Fuel system.\nThe key perspective here is how to manage the existing and future spent fuel\nproduced at nuclear reactors in the U.S.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\n2) consider the broader issue of how nuclear energy relates to the overall provision of\nelectric power in the US.\nSo if you choose a subteam organizational structure, here's how you would likely\nproceed.\nEach subteam should complete a first iteration of Steps 1-4 of the CLIOS Process as\ndescribed in the user's guide.\nThe expected deliverables and relative workload are summarized below:\nStep 1 should be less than 1 page of text. The emphasis is on the checklists which should\nhave approximately 5 to 20 items each.\nStep 2 defines subsystems and actor groups. You should indicate which subsystems and\nactor groups you choose in about a page.\nSteps 3&4 populate the subsystems with the most important / relevant components. One\ndiagram per subsystem along with one page of explanation of what are the major\ninteractions is sufficient. Try not to include more than 15 components/actors in any of\nyour subsystems. Also populate the institutional sphere with actors and discuss the\nrelationships among them (1 page). Finally discuss the Type 2 links (projections)\nbetween actors and components.\nNotice that as long as diagram notation is consistent and explained then it is not\nnecessary for the teams to follow the CLIOS Process notation. Clarity is important\nthough. There are several software tools you can use to create the diagrams (MS Word,\nMS Powerpoint, VISIO, Vensim etc). Any of the above is fine or you can do it by hand.\nAfter having completed the above you are asked to convene as a team to \"merge\" the\ntwo CLIOS representations and\n1. identify how the CLIOS Systems intersect\n2. indicate how decisions made in the broader system (energy industry) affect the\nSNF subsystem\n3. discuss the difficulties that you have encountered in completing the tasks. What\nwere they? Were they common?\n4. discuss how your team worked together. How did you choose to organize\nyourselves? Would you do it differently now, given your experience?\nThis task should be about three pages or less.\nAn alternative to the above is that your team work as one unit on both tasks\nsimultaneously - your choice! The outputs should be the same, regardless of how you\nchoose to organize yourselves.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nResources\nYou are free to use outside sources although for this level of representation a basic\nsystem understanding is sufficient.\nPurpose\nThis assignment is intended to familiarize you with constructing a first-order CLIOS\nSystem representation for a broad system. Our expectations are not to obtain the perfect\nrepresentation - both CLIOS Systems are huge - but to see that you can exercise your\njudgment in identifying the salient characteristics and interactions in each CLIOS System\nand how the two relate. Different teams will probably come up with different\nrepresentations focusing on different system aspects in a way that reflects the differing\nperspectives of the team members. That's fine! There is no right answer! But good\nanswers are carefully crafted and exhibit clear thinking.\nGrading\nYour team will receive one grade for this assignment.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

For this assignment,\nwe ask you to describe a particular system and to use that system as a way of further\ndeveloping your systems thinking skills.\n\nThe system you select should be \"large\", have important technical content, and should\nrelate to an important societal issue. We characterize those systems as socio-technical and\nthe issues as Critical Contemporary Issues (CCI).\n\nIssues relating to the behavior of such systems are reported in the media every day. For\nthis assignment we ask you to get a current article from some news source concerned\nwith the system of interest to you. Then, we ask you to describe this system, explaining\nwhat issues relating to your system make it newsworthy, and any complexity or\nuncertainties inherent in your system of interest--it is virtually guaranteed that any\ninteresting system you select will have a good deal of complexity and uncertainty. You\nwill want to discuss how your system relates to its \"relevant environment\" and identify\nkey issues relating to its performance.\n\nAfter you have identified the system you are interested in from current news sources, you\nmay want to seek additional sources to enhance your understanding and the issues that\nmake it of current interest, thus making your answer more substantive. Please cite those\nsources.\n\nTo help calibrate you on the level of detail we are looking for, please limit your response\nto three pages (not including the list of sources).

There are a number of possibilities and DoE wants some help in thinking\nthrough and sorting out the strategic alternatives for improving the GCC posture of the US. This\nis a step along the way to the overall design of a complex engineering system\n\nThey engage a (high-priced) consulting firm (you) to help them think through the issues. Your\nfirm's P1 was submitted to DoE to show the quality of your thinking in the energy field, and they\nhave engaged you (as well as a competing firm--them) to take the next steps in this study. At\nsome point in the future, DoE will select one of the firms to complete the study, but for now, it's\na competition as DoE wants to get a number of ideas on the table.\n\nWe should note there has been a shakeout in the consulting world for firms that specialize in the\nenergy industry. The old firms, unimaginatively named Team A, Team B and Team C, have\nconsolidated into two firms (who should each come up with a better name--branding is\neverything). As it happens, each firm has at least one member from the original three firms so\neach firm can draw on all the P1 thinking easily. Each firm has a mentor; the teams and their\nmentors are shown in the appendix.\n\nDoE, having studied the three P1s submitted by the original three firms, understands\n\n1) that nuclear power is a potentially valuable source of power from non-carbon based\nsources\n2) so nuclear power can be a way to address GCC\n3) that the role nuclear power can play is linked closely to how the SNF is managed (and\nwe know that \"managed\" has many interpretations) and this may limit how effective the nuclear\noption can be\n\nTherefore, DoE wants to consider other strategic alternatives for addressing GCC beyond\nnuclear.\n\nWhat DoE wants is a two-stage study as follows.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nPart 1 Strategic alternatives for SNF\n\nCurrently, nuclear energy provides about 20% of the US electrical energy base. DoE is interested\nin scenarios in which\n1) it grows to 40% over the next 25 years,\n2) it continues flat at 20% over that same time period, and\n3) nuclear energy in the US is phased out over a 25-year time frame, going from the\ncurrent 20% to zero.\n\nOf course, these scenarios have various probabilities of occurrence, but DoE is interested in\nunderstanding the implications of each of them. Clearly, whichever of these futures plays out will\naffect the amount of spent nuclear fuel produced quite substantially and hence the strategic\nalternatives associated with managing it will presumably vary as well. In addition, there is the\nuncertainty of the overall energy demand growth in the US over that time period.\n\nIn a brainstorming session at your firm, your CEO indicated that she was impressed by the initial\nresults of the CLIOS Process (P1)--after all, it got the firm this paid job (P1 was speculative and\nthere was no fee)--and wants to continue using the CLIOS Process believing it gives you a\ncompetitive edge over your rival (little does she know that the opposing firm is on the CLIOS\nProcess bandwagon as well).\n\nIn this next stage, building on the CLIOS representations developed in P1, you will partially\nexecute steps 6, 7, and 8 of the CLIOS process. So you will first perform Step 6. In particular,\nyou will develop refined goals and specify performance measures under each of the three\nscenarios described above. No models or framework are required, but you will see the need to\ndevelop some preliminary analyses to scope the problem. You should be able to describe your\nwork in Step 6 in 3 to 4 pages (not including any lists, tables, or figures).\n\nThen you will perform Step 8. The problem specification by DoE has itself identified some major\nuncertainties, namely the future of nuclear power, and the growth rate of energy use in the United\nStates. But there are certainly others that you might consider in your identification of major\nuncertainties. Approximately 2 pages should be adequate for presenting this step.\n\nThen in Step 7, we turn to the major focus of this part of the project: the creation of a set of\nstrategic alternatives for each of the three scenarios specified by DoE that consider the other\nuncertainties and factors you identified in P1. You are not asked at this stage to do a detailed\nanalysis of these strategic alternatives. That will come later. Now, we are going through the\n\"creative\" phase of the CLIOS process, where useful strategic alternatives are identified for later\nmore careful study, recognizing the broad range of future conditions that the SNF management\nsystem will have to deal with. Brainstorming about strategic alternatives will probably generate a\nlarge number of possible alternatives. In approximately one page, write down up to 20 of the\nmost promising/interesting strategic alternatives using a descriptive title and a very brief\nexplanation for each. As you narrow down your solution space, the number of strategic\nalternatives you identify as most promising among them is up to you but 6 is the upper limit.\nDon't feel that you must come up with 6. A smaller number of well-characterized strategic\nalternatives is preferable to a large number of poorly explained ones. You should limit your\ndescription of each strategic alternative to one page.\n\nPart 2--Considering additional strategic alternatives\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nDoE believes that under some of the scenarios described above--for example, a high market\nshare for nuclear and high energy growth--managing the amount of SNF generated may simply\nnot be possible. DoE thinks the 40% scenario will be very difficult to handle from an SNF\nperspective, especially with high overall growth (HOG) in energy use. In the 40%, HOG scenario\nwe are producing a lot of power in a non-carbon based manner. But DoE believes that in the 40%,\nHOG scenario, there will be too much SNF to handle.\n\nSo DoE wants you to develop additional strategic alternatives for dealing with 40%, HOG\nscenario that would be less dependent on nuclear power, but with no increase in greenhouse gases\n(compared with the 40%, HOG scenario) causing GCC.\n\nHere we ask you to do Step 7 only. You will enumerate 3 additional strategic alternatives that\nhave the potential to achieve this goal, describing each in about 1 page.\n\nA preview on where you will go from here\n\nOnce you have completed Part 1 and Part 2, you will have a good list of strategic alternatives in\nthe nuclear realm and beyond that realm as well. The two teams will then meet with the \"DoE\nsecretary\" (aka Prof Sussman) to present their full list of strategic alternatives to select which\nones make sense for further more detailed study. The evaluation of these strategic alternatives and\nthe selection of some for implementation will take us close to the end of the semester.\n\nThis assignment is due on April 10, well after Spring Break. However, we strongly advise you to\nmeet with your firm several times before Spring Break to get organized and on track. At least one\nof those meetings should be with your mentor. In this early stage you should start thinking about\nanother creative piece to this project--deciding how to structure your approach to Steps 6, 7 and\n8 given how DoE wants you to address the issues. There are several viable approaches your\nmentor has thought of, but it would be no surprise if you were to come up with a better, original\napproach. Your team should think that through carefully, running ideas by your mentor as you\nproceed.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

These attributes make it difficult to represent\nand study CLIOS Systems. We have developed a CLIOS Process to help study such systems.\nThe CLIOS Process can be used as an organizing mechanism for understanding a CLIOS\nSystem's underlying structure and behavior, identifying and deploying strategic alternatives\nfor improving the system's performance, and monitoring the performance of those strategic\nalternatives. Moreover, it is an iterative process that allows for continuous learning about the\nsystem by both studying and intervening in the system.\nC\n\nA key motivation behind the need for a CLIOS Process is the presence of \"nested\ncomplexity\", which results when a physical domain is nested within and interacts with an\ninstitutional sphere, where both are complex. The study of CLIOS Systems requires the use\nof a variety of models and frameworks, with quantitative engineering and economic models\nbeing used for the physical domain, and qualitative frameworks for understanding\ninstitutional, organizational and stakeholder behavior being used for the institutional sphere.\nAn important aspect of the CLIOS Process is the integration of the analyses of the physical\ndomain and institutional sphere, and the development of strategic alternatives for both.\n\nThe CLIOS Process consists of three stages:\n1. Representation of the CLIOS System structure and behavior,\n2. Design, Evaluation and Selection of CLIOS System strategic alternatives, and\n3. Implementation of the selected strategic alternatives.\n\nThe representation stage is primarily diagrammatic in nature. Diagrams are used to represent\nthe structure and behavior of the CLIOS System by graphically illustrating the system\ncomponents and interactions in the physical domain, on the institutional sphere. and between\nthem. An accompanying text describing and explaining the CLIOS System diagrams is often\nhelpful.\n\nThe CLIOS Process can be thought of as a Christmas tree and its ornaments; the tree\nrepresents the overall process and the ornaments represent the specific tools (e.g. benefit-cost\nanalysis, probabilistic risk assessment, system simulations, stakeholder analysis, scenario\nplanning, design structure matrices, etc.) that one can use for specific steps in the overall\nprocess. This paper describes the overall CLIOS Process and particular regimes of tools that\ncan be used in the study of CLIOS Systems. The appendix highlights tools that can be used\nfor more advanced analyses of CLIOS systems.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

Our World is CLIOS\nOur world is complex, large-scale, interconnected, open and sociotechnical (CLIOS). The\nterm \"CLIOS System\" was conceived as a way to capture the salient characteristics of a class\nof engineering systems with wide-ranging economic, social, political and environmental\nimpacts that are of growing interest to researchers, decisionmakers, policy makers and\nstakeholders. The CLIOS framework provides a way to describe, understand, study, and\nultimately, to improve the performance of a wide range of systems. Systems that can be\ndescribed and analyzed as CLIOS Systems include air traffic control systems, the global\nenergy/climate system, the National Missile Defense system and the eBay online trading\nsystem (Magee and de Weck, 2002; Zuckerman, 2002). The boundaries of CLIOS Systems\nare often defined by an existing or impending problem, such as the reduction of air pollutant\nemissions from transportation systems in megacities, or the transport and storage of spent\nnuclear fuel from nuclear power plants.\n\nWe begin by defining the primary characteristics of CLIOS Systems.\n\nComplex: A system is \"complex\" when it is composed of a group of interrelated components\nand subsystems, (those terms will be defined more rigorously later), for which the degree and\nnature of the relationships between them is imperfectly known, with varying directionality,\nmagnitude and time-scales of interactions. While there are many types of complexities\ndefined in the literature (Sussman 2002, Lloyd 2002), we are primarily concerned with four\ntypes of complexities for CLIOS Systems:\n\nStructural Complexity (also known as combinatorial or detail complexity) exists when\nthe system consists of a large number of interconnected parts.\n\nBehavioral complexity (also referred to as dynamic complexity) exists when\npredictions of system outputs or behavior is difficult. This can be found even in\nsystems with low structural complexity when their parts interact over time in closely-\ncoupled feedback loops. Even if we understand the internal behavior of individual\nsubsystems and components, our lack of understanding of the relationships between\nthese components and subsystems leads to difficulties in making predictions of overall\nCLIOS System behavior. Emergence is a specific example of behavioral complexity in\nwhich the laws or rules governing the behavior or individual components are simple,\nbut the patterns of overall behavior that result are complex and usually surprising\n(Holland, 1998).\n\nNested Complexity is a concept that suggests a complex \"physical/technical\" system\nembedded within an institutional system (which we will later refer to as an\ninstitutional sphere). Moreover, the institutional system exhibits structural and\nbehavioral complexity in its own right. The two-way interactions between the\nphysical/technical and institutional systems create \"nested complexity.\"\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n\nEvaluative Complexity reflects the multi-stakeholder environment in which CLIOS\nSystems exist - different stakeholders value different aspects of system performance\nin different ways, making decision-making difficult. Simply put, what may be good\nperformance to one stakeholder, may not be good performance to another stakeholder.\nEven if one could make good predictions about the behavior of the CLIOS System\nwhen strategic alternatives are implemented, evaluative complexity means it is still\ndifficult to make a decision about what to do.\n\nLarge-Scale: CLIOS Systems have impacts that are large in magnitude, and often long-lived\nand of \"large-scale\" geographical extent. For this reason, as we argue later, CLIOS Systems\nare often related to Critical Contemporary Issues.\n\nInterconnected: CLIOS Systems are often interconnected with other sociotechnical systems.\nAs an example, one could point to the relationships between transportation systems, energy\nsystems and the global climate system.\n\nOpen: CLIOS Systems explicitly include social, political and economic aspects (Sussman,\n2000) beyond the technical or \"engineered\" system; we are concerned about system\nperformance on these dimensions.\n\nSociotechnical: To distinguish CLIOS Systems from systems in which we may consider only\ntechnical aspects (such as complex computer programs) or purely social systems in which\ntechnology is not a central consideration (such as the social security system), we emphasize\ntheir sociotechnical nature. Technology plays a central role in CLIOS Systems, as does the\nsocial context within which the system is operating.\n\nWe think of a CLIOS System as consisting of a physical domain - with interconnected\nphysical subsystems - embedded in an institutional sphere (i.e. nested complexity). This is\nillustrated in Figure 1. Therefore, when we speak of a CLIOS System, we refer both to the\nphysical and the institutional aspects of the system; we include both domains.\n\nHere, subsystems refer to major parts of the physical domain. We visualize the subsystems as\nbeing divided into distinct layers, but with interconnections between the subsystems (or\n\"layers\"). As we will see, the choice of how to divide the physical domain into logical\nsubsystems is up to the analyst and will depend on the issues and problems that motivate the\nanalysis. Components (the small circles on the subsystem layers) are the basic units that\nmake up a subsystem; links among them represent their interconnections. The institutional\nsphere includes actors and organizations (i.e. the institutional stakeholders) that influence and\naffect (and are affected by) one or all of the subsystems.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

The transportation subsystem could incorporate components such as: private auto fleet,\ncongestion, freight transportation demand, etc. Finally, the institutional sphere (in a US\ncontext) would include agencies like DOT, EPA, and DOE, along with advocacy groups, auto\nmanufacturing companies, etc. Finally, the programs and regulations specified in the Clean\nAir Act would be an example of policy linkages from an organization on the institutional\nsphere (EPA) to components within the transportation and environment subsystems.\n1.2. The Need for a CLIOS Process\nThe primary motivation for this paper is the authors' perception that there is a need for a new\nprocess for both analyzing and managing the complex sociotechnical systems that are at the\ncore of many of society's most intractable contemporary problems. Its value lies in its clearly\nstructured process for approaching problems related to CLIOS Systems, starting the user at\nthe very basic and simple description of the system, and leading the user step by step through\na learning process of increasing complexity and depth (see Figure 4). The CLIOS Process can\nlead the user from problem and goal identification to implementation and adaptation of\nstrategic alternatives, with an explicit systems approach to both analyzing and addressing\nproblems.\n\nBecause of the many subsystems involved, the uncertainty in the behavior of the subsystems\nand their interactions, and the degree of human agency involved, the behavior of CLIOS\nSystems is difficult to predict and often counterintuitive (i.e. exhibiting behavioral\ncomplexity). This holds true even when subsystem behavior is readily predictable. One of\nthe unique contributions of the CLIOS framework is it provides a set of tools for learning how\nto visualize, think about, discuss, and debate solutions for CLIOS Systems in a structured, but\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nflexible (or \"modular\") format. The representation phase of the CLIOS Process is critical in\nthis respect. As an analogy, engineering drawings are fundamental to the creative process of\nengineering design, when one is engineering objects or devices or machines, ranging from\nsimple gears to bridges to a space station.2 For CLIOS Systems, similar \"tools of\nvisualization\" are needed to build intuition and systems thinking for students and analysts.\nFigure 1 above is a basic example of how one can begin to visualize and conceptualize the\nsystem.3 Section 4 describes more fully the steps in the \"representation\" stage of the CLIOS\nanalysis, which is used to gain important insights into the system via visualization.\n\nWe further argue that there is a need for a framework that is capable of capturing the\ncomplexity of these sociotechnical systems, while at the same time allowing analysts to\nincorporate qualitative and institutional factors. Developing quantitative models that will\npredict the performance of the physical domain can be very difficult and costly. Looking to\nthe institutional sphere, increasingly sophisticated systems models have evolved to\nincorporate economic, social and political interactions with the physical domain (Marks,\n2002). Yet, the ability to fully integrate economic, social and political issues into a systems\nframework has continued to be limited by a relatively weaker understanding of organizational\nand institutional structures (Flood and Carson, 1993). The CLIOS Process provides a\nstructured process for the analysis of both the physical and institutional aspects of the system.\n\nFinally, the CLIOS Process enables analysis in order to better understand the system, but also\nprovides a structured process for \"intervening in\" and changing the system in order to\nimprove outcomes or performance. The CLIOS Process is used for the design and\nimplementation of what we call \"strategic alternatives\" that are intended to enhance the\nperformance of the CLIOS system. These strategic alternatives can take the form of changes\nto the subsystems in the physical domain, or changes to the related organizations and their\ninter-relationships on the institutional sphere.\n1.3. Who Will Find Value in the CLIOS Process?\nThe CLIOS Process is valuable for both analyzing and changing/improving systems where\nexisting methodological approaches such as cost-benefit analysis, simulation modeling, and\nstakeholder analysis fail to capture relevant and salient issues either on the\ntechnical/engineering or social/political side of the problem. It is particularly useful for\ndealing with problems for which the system boundaries may not be immediately evident.\nFurthermore, the CLIOS Process is \"discipline-neutral,\" in that the users do not require\ntraining in any specific disciplinary methodologies to successfully apply the CLIOS Process.\nHowever, users can and should incorporate specific methodologies (including some of the\nmore advanced models and tools described in Appendix A) at specific steps in the process.\nWhat the CLIOS Process does require is a strong systems-thinking approach by the individual\nor group undertaking the analysis. As suggested above, the CLIOS Process can be carried out\n\n2 See D. Newman (2002) on principles of engineering drawing for undergraduate engineering students. For a historical\ndiscussion of the role of engineering drawings as a \"tool of visualization\" for engineers, to support intuition and nonverbal\nthinking, see E. Ferguson (1992).\n3 Some students, see C. Osorio-Urzua (2007) have built upon Figure 1 to deepen their understanding of their own system of\ninterest. Osorio-Urzua expanded the institutional sphere to an internal and external sphere, in order to better describe the\nroles of different organizations and groups on the institutional sphere in relation to the physical systems.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

Potential users of the CLIOS Process include the\nfollowing:\n\nStudents/Researchers: The CLIOS Process has been used for class projects - at both the\ngraduate and undergraduate level - as a pedagogical tool, training students to approach and\nanalyze engineering systems holistically.4 It has also been used as a research framework for\nmaster's theses and doctoral dissertations for understanding systems that can be characterized\nas CLIOS Systems.5 These theses have not only applied the CLIOS Process, but have\nillustrated the modularity of the CLIOS Process itself. Indeed, several students have extended\nand deepened the CLIOS Process in order to better understand their own CLIOS systems.\n\nDecisionmakers: In addition to its research and pedagogical role, the CLIOS Process can also\nbe employed by public or private sector decisionmakers, with responsibility for one or more\ncomponents of a subsystem, to change and improve the system.\n\nStakeholders: Citizens, private sector actors, non-profit organizations and advocacy groups\nthat are affected for good or ill by the CLIOS System, can also use the CLIOS Process in a\nmore participatory format to attempt to influence its performance. In CLIOS terms, both\ndecisionmakers and stakeholders \"populate\" the institutional sphere.\n\nExperts/Analysts: Individuals or groups that provide analysis and recommendations to\ndecisionmakers and stakeholders are the fourth group of potential users of the CLIOS Process.\nThese experts/analysts may be a part of the CLIOS System (i.e. as employees of an\norganization on the institutional sphere) or retained to study the CLIOS System as consultants\n(and therefore do not \"populate\" the institutional sphere, but provide advice to decisionmakers\nor stakeholders that do \"populate\" the institutional sphere).\n\nPart of the value is that all of these individuals/groups can work together on the CLIOS\nProcess. For clarity, this paper outlines and describes the CLIOS Process as though it were\nbeing carried out by a single analyst. Yet, in practice, participation by stakeholders and\ndecisionmakers using the CLIOS Process as a collaborative group process will (or should)\noccur (Mostashari, 2005). It is envisioned that the CLIOS Process could create a forum where\nstakeholders systematically raise and elaborate upon their concerns, so that these concerns\ncould be adequately addressed by decisionmakers and policymakers, without losing the\nunderstanding of the systems as a whole. For example, in the context of the unsustainable\npatterns of metropolitan development, Innes (1997) notes that \"efforts to intervene have been\nmade by one or another set of interests, each grasping the elephant by only one of its parts and\nmisunderstanding the whole.\" This is not uncommon in the policy world as a multitude of\nagents have an influence on individual subsystems in a larger, complex and interconnected\nsystem, thus leading to unintended consequences on the other subsystems. Clearer\nframeworks for understanding systems holistically could enable decisionmakers to better see\ntheir function as \"part of a complex system of linked factors in the physical environmental\nand the governmental context\" (Innes, 1997). We suggest that the CLIOS Process supports\nthis effort.\n\n4 Moses (2006), for example, stresses a holistic approach as \"fundamental\" to Engineering Systems.\n5 Kometer (2005), Ward (2005), Mostashari (2005), and Osorio-Urzua (2007) are some examples.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n2. KEY CONCEPTS\n2.1. CLIOS System Representation\nThe CLIOS Process begins with a \"representation\" of the CLIOS System both\ndiagrammatically as well as with supporting text. The motivation for the representation is to\nconvey the structural relationships and direction of influence between the components within\na CLIOS system and subsystems. In this sense, the CLIOS system representation is an\norganizing mechanism for mapping out the system's underlying structure and behavior - a\nprecursor to identifying strategic alternatives for improving the system's performance. We\nwill look at representation in more detail when we go through the steps of the CLIOS Process.\n\nAs noted earlier, the CLIOS Process can be applied by individuals or groups. When carried\nout by a group, it can generate a shared and more complete understanding of the system\namong various decisionmakers, analysts and stakeholders, each bringing to bear their own\nperspectives, knowledge, preferences and values. Because the representation is primarily\nqualitative in nature, the CLIOS Process allows for the participation of a range of actors with\ndifferent levels of expertise.\n2.2. Nested Complexity\nAs previously noted, a key motivation for a CLIOS Process is the characteristic of \"nested\ncomplexity\" present in all CLIOS systems. According to this concept, a CLIOS System is\ncomprised of a complex physical domain, which follows quantitative principles that can be\napproximated by engineering and economic models, surrounded by a \"messier\" institutional\nsphere (see Figure 1). On the sphere is the organizational and institutional network of\npolicymakers, firms, non-governmental organizations, and stakeholders that together\ncomprise the institutions that interact with the physical domain.6 Analyzing this sphere of\norganizations and institutions requires different methodologies - usually qualitative in nature\nand often more participatory, such as evaluation of stakeholder perspectives and\norganizational analysis.\n\nWe therefore have \"nested complexity\" when the physical domain is being affected or\nmanaged, loosely speaking, by a complex organizational and policymaking system. However,\nwhile we make a distinction between the physical domain and institutional sphere -we also\nneed to understand the connections between the physical domain and institutional spheres.\nIndeed, an important step in the CLIOS System representation is to identify and characterize\nthese links. Understanding nested complexity is a necessary step in moving towards better\nintegrating institutional design with technical design.\n\n6 We realize that representing the physical and institutional spheres in this manner - more structured and quantifiable\nphysical domains, compared to messier, more chaotic, and more complex, human-based institutional spheres - runs the risk\nof overstating the dichotomy between systems composed of \"things\" and systems composed of \"people.\" This discussion has\nbeen taken up by researchers from many disciplines, we would refer the reader to Almond and Genco, 1977 and Flood and\nCarson, 1993 (in particular, pp. 251-2).\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n2.3. Critical Contemporary Issues (CCIs)\nAs mentioned earlier, the boundaries of CLIOS Systems are often defined by the issues and\nproblems that emerge within these complex sociotechnical systems and by the means\navailable to the decision-makers to affect the system. Examples of critical contemporary\nissues include productivity; competitiveness; economic development; sustainability, including\nenergy/environment/air quality/global climate change; urban form (e.g., the mega-cities of the\ndeveloping world and sprawl in the developed world); social equity; environmental justice;\nquality of life; congestion/mobility/accessibility; security; technology development and\ndeployment; and doubtless many others.\n\nCritical contemporary issues share the characteristic of requiring interdisciplinary approaches\n- approaches that do not come neatly boxed in traditional disciplines (engineering or non-\nengineering) but rather are integrative in nature. They also require systems thinking. Various\nkinds of complexity - structural, behavioral, nested and evaluative - as described in Section\n1.1, are also invariably present. The CLIOS Process is designed with exactly these kinds of\nCCIs in mind.\n2.4. Strategic Alternatives\nThe CLIOS Process is structured not only to support analysis, but guide users in their efforts\nto change, affect or otherwise intervene in the system, in order to address the problem (or\nCCI) that motivated the analysis in the first place. Strategic alternatives are essentially the\nchanges we consider to improve the performance of the CLIOS System. The creative part of\nthe CLIOS Process is in designing a set of such alternatives and selecting among them. It\noften takes imagination and insight into the CLIOS System under consideration to develop\nuseful and feasible strategic alternatives. Yet, rarely will we implement a single strategic\nalternative. Usually we select a set of strategic alternatives for simultaneous or phased\nimplementation. We call these sets \"bundles.\"\n\nStrategic alternatives may be developed for both the physical domain and the institutional\nsphere. Usually, strategic alternatives that influence the physical domain need to be\ncomplemented by changes in the institutional sphere that would make the implementation of\nthe alternative possible.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

OVERVIEW OF THE CLIOS PROCESS\nWe will now walk through the CLIOS Process step-by-step, presenting the basic or\n\"barebones\" structure of the CLIOS Process. At several points in our discussion, we will also\ndescribe ways in which the CLIOS Process can be \"tailored\" by utilizing additional methods,\nboth quantitative and qualitative, at various steps in the process. In order to maintain clarity,\nwe will differentiate between what the authors consider to be (a) the core of the CLIOS\nProcess, (b) examples of how to carry out specific steps in the CLIOS Process, and (c)\nspecific models and frameworks that can be used to \"tailor\" the CLIOS Process.\n3.1. The Basic Structure: 3 Stages and 12 Steps\nThe CLIOS Process is composed of twelve steps, divided into three stages (see Figure 2). The\nthree stages are: Representation; Design, Evaluation and Selection; and Implementation. In\nStage One - Representation - the CLIOS System representation is created and considered in\nterms of both its structure and behavior. In this stage, we also establish preliminary goals for\nthe CLIOS System - i.e. in what ways do we want to improve its performance. In Stage Two\n- Design, Evaluation and Selection -strategic alternatives for performance improvements to\nthe physical domain and institutional sphere are designed, evaluated and finally some are\nselected. In Stage Three - Implementation - implementation plans for the physical domain\nand the institutional sphere are designed and refined. An overview of the three stages is\nshown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Summary of Three Stages\nStage\nKey Ideas\nOutputs\nRepresentation\nUnderstanding and visualizing the\nstructure and behavior\nEstablishing preliminary goals\nSystem description, issue\nidentification, goal identification, and\nstructural representation\nDesign,\nEvaluation, and\nSelection\nRefining goals aimed at\nimprovement of the CLIOS System\nDeveloping bundles of strategic\nalternatives\nIdentification of performance\nmeasures, identification and design of\nstrategic alternatives, evaluation of\nbundles of strategic alternatives, and\nselection of the best performing\nbundle(s).\nImplementation\nImplementing bundles of strategic\nalternatives\nFollowing-through - changing and\nmonitoring the performance of the\nCLIOS System\nImplementation strategy for strategic\nalternatives in the physical domain and\nthe institutional sphere, actual\nimplementation of alternatives, and\npost-implementation evaluation.\n\nIn using the CLIOS Process, the analyst will often need to pose questions at each stage similar\nto those shown in Table 2 below.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

How are these actors/organizations related to each other?\n\nDo the types of policies made by different organizations on the institutional sphere reinforce or\ncounter each other?\n\nUnder the current institutional structure, can organizations manage the system to achieve target\nlevels of performance?\n\nIn summary, the first stage is used to understand structural, behavioral, nested, and evaluative\ncomplexity; the second stage is used to create and evaluate strategic alternatives for\nimproving system performance; and the final stage brings various alternatives for the physical\nand institutional systems together to form and implement a feasible strategy or plan for\nimproving the CLIOS System. One of the differences of the CLIOS Process from other\nsystem approaches is that the strategic alternatives for implementation may include changes to\nboth the physical and institutional systems.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

The twelve steps are coded by the\nshading of the boxes to indicate whether they are part of the representation; design, evaluation\nand selection; or implementation stage. Step 5 indicates more of a transition, than a \"step\"\nper se in the analysis. This marks the key transition from a descriptive treatment (trying to\nunderstand) to a prescriptive treatment (trying to intervene, change, improve) of the system.\n\nFigure 2: The Twelve Steps of the CLIOS Process\nPHASES\nSTEPS\n\nREPRESENTATION\nDESIGN, EVALUATION,\n& SELECTION\nIMPLEMENTATION &\nADAPTATION\n2.

For example, one identifies and describes\nboth the components and the links between those components at the same time (Steps 4A and\n4B). Steps 7 and 8 will also occur more or less simultaneously. As one identifies and\nanalyzes strategic alternatives to change the CLIOS system, additional uncertainties may\nbegin to surface. In other words, as one thinks about how to \"tinker with\" the system, it often\nbecomes clear that one does not fully understand the ways that the whole system will react in\nresponse to this \"tinkering,\" both in the short and long run.\n\nThe reader should bear in mind that while we show the CLIOS Process as a set of ordered\nsteps, we emphasize that this is an iterative process, and not a rigid, once-through process.\nIndeed, as shown in Figure 3, there are several important points where iteration can occur. As\nwe go through the steps of the CLIOS Process, we will highlight where and how iteration\nback to earlier steps can be done (having labeled some of these iterations as A, B, and so on,\nfor reference).\n\nFigure 3: Iteration in the CLIOS Process\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\n2.

Tailoring the CLIOS Process\nThe above discussion sketches out the basic structure for the CLIOS Process. However, we\nhave noted earlier that this is a flexible and modular process. Additional tools and methods of\nanalysis can be used to support the twelve steps introduced in Figure 2. As a useful analogy\nfor understanding the modularity of the CLIOS Process, one can say that the CLIOS Process\nis structured like a Christmas tree. Its overall structure allows for quantitative and qualitative\nanalytical tools (we call these \"models\" and \"frameworks\"), which are suitable for each\nstage/step to be \"attached\" to the CLIOS Process like ornaments on a tree.\n\nWhen conducting the CLIOS Process, one therefore has the opportunity to tailor the process\naccording to the needs and abilities of the users - whether students, decisionmakers,\nexperts/analysts or stakeholders. Presented later in this paper (Appendix A) is an overview of\nvarious tools (or \"ornaments\") and how these tools can be selected to \"hang on to the CLIOS\nProcess Christmas tree.\" How one decides to decorate the tree depends on the particular\nCLIOS System in question, the motivation for the analysis, and the level of analytical\nsophistication desired. The selection and use of these tools will also depend upon the training\nand background of the individual or group undertaking the CLIOS Process, the data available,\nand the amount of time that can be dedicated to the CLIOS Process, among other factors. For\nthis reason, we suggest that it is a flexible process.\n\nMODELS AND FRAMEWORKS As a note on how to read this user's\nguide, as we describe the steps in the CLIOS Process, we use separate boxes\nsuch as this box in order to highlight where specific models or frameworks -\nthe \"ornaments\" on the CLIOS Process \"Christmas tree\" - can be applied to\nhelp the analysts through one or more steps in the process.\n\nAlthough additional models and frameworks can be applied to support the\nanalysis of most of the steps in the CLIOS Process, they will be most useful\nbeginning after Step 5, when we transition from a descriptive to prescriptive\ntreatment of the CLIOS System.\n\n3.3. Learning about CLIOS Systems\nIn essence, the CLIOS Process is set up as an approach to learn about CLIOS systems and\nstructure analyses in a way that enables continuous learning for students, decisionmakers, and\nstakeholders. The learning process occurs regardless of whether the CLIOS Process is carried\nout by individuals or a group. Figure 4 illustrates how the understanding of the CLIOS\nSystem should evolve as one progresses through the 12 steps of the CLIOS Process.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

However,\nbecause this is an iterative process, even during the \"prescriptive\" mode, one's descriptive\nunderstanding of the system can change. The analysts can update their understanding of the\nsystem structure and behavior, decide how to better \"bound\" the system, and appreciate its\nkey uncertainties, as one assesses different possibilities for improving the system.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n4. STAGE 1: REPRESENTATION\nThe representation stage aids in the understanding of the complete CLIOS System by\nexamining the structures and behaviors of the physical subsystems and institutional sphere\nand the interactions between them. The CLIOS Process usually uses a combination of\ndiagrams and text to capture the critical aspects of the CLIOS System and present them in an\neasy to comprehend format. This allows the users of the CLIOS Process to understand the\nCLIOS System and establishes the basis for completing the second and third stages of the\nCLIOS Process.\n\nWhen the CLIOS Process is carried out by a group of analysts, decisionmakers, and\nstakeholders, the representation stage is used to create a common understanding of the system\namong these actors. In this manner, the issues and goals associated with the CLIOS System\ncan be reasonably discussed based on a good understanding of its basic characteristics. Some\nagreement on the issues and goals will be necessary to be able to eventually successfully\ncreate and ultimately implement strategic alternatives for system performance improvements\nin later stages. While all the stakeholders may not agree about goals at this early\nrepresentation stage, it is not too early to start building a common understanding that can lead,\nwe hope, to consensus in the later stages.\n\nIn the steps below, we present one approach to complex system representation. It is, by no\nmeans, the only way. It may not even be the best way for all CLIOS Systems. However, this\napproach has proven useful in the CLIOS System representations that have been conducted to\ndate. Because this approach to the CLIOS Process is flexible, it allows for creativity on the\npart of the users of the CLIOS Process, as to how to develop their system representations.\n4.1. Step 1: Describe CLIOS System: Checklists and\nPreliminary Goal Identification\nIn developing the CLIOS System representation, we first create several checklists to serve as\na high-level examination of the CLIOS System, as shown in Figure 5. The lists should address\nthe question: \"what is it about the system that makes it interesting?\" (Puccia and Levins,\n1985). One can draw upon a wide range of sources: academic articles and books, popular\npress, reports published by government, business, non-governmental organizations, etc.\nUnderstanding the historical context and development of the system can also be useful for\ninsights regarding current issues, challenges, and recurring themes or issues. For example,\nearlier attempts to change and improve the system, whether successes or failures, can\nhighlight certain structures or dynamics within the system. It is particularly useful if the\nCLIOS Process user has previous experience with the CLIOS System under study, or with\nother related systems, and can bring that experience to bear on the checklists and preliminary\ngoal identification.\n\nThe first of the checklists is the characteristics checklist that may relate to: (a) the temporal\nand geographic scale of the system, (b) the core technologies and systems, (c) the natural\nphysical conditions that affect or are affected by the system, (d) the key economic and market\nfactors, (e) important social or political factors or controversies related to the system and (f)\nthe historical development and context of the CLIOS System.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n\nThe second checklist captures opportunities, issues and challenges - those aspects of the\nCLIOS System for which we may seek constructive improvements through strategic\nalternatives in Stage 2.\n\nFinally, in the third checklist, we identify preliminary system goals, which often relate to the\nopportunities, issues and challenges found in the second checklist.\n\nThe initial checklists for the CLIOS System serve as a valuable basis for the rest of the\nanalysis. In particular, as we continue to develop the CLIOS System representation, we can\nreturn to these checklists to identify any major issues that have been omitted. The checklists\nshould capture the concerns and needs of a broad set of stakeholders, including policy makers,\nsystem managers and operators, customers and so forth. As the CLIOS Process is intended to\nfacilitate better performance of the system, one has to ask \"What are the management and\npolicy questions that need to be addressed?\" and \"What are the goals for the CLIOS System?\"\n\nFigure 5: CLIOS System Checklists\n\nCharacteristics\nChecklist\n\nOpportunities/Issues/\nChallenges Checklist\n\nPreliminary CLIOS\nSystem Goals\nChecklist\n\nThis first step also implicitly bounds the CLIOS System, at least preliminarily. Given that\nCLIOS is an iterative process, boundaries are expected to expand and/or contract as the\nCLIOS Process advances and focuses more clearly. Redefining the system boundaries in later\niterations may actually signal a shift in the analysts' mental models of the system, as\nsuggested by Figure 4.\n\nA\nOur first example where iteration may occur, identified as \"A\" in Figure 3, is the\niteration that occurs between Step 1 and Step 6. In Step 1, some preliminary system\ngoals are identified as the overarching description of the CLIOS System is developed.\nHowever, these goals will be revisited in greater depth in Step 6 (Refine CLIOS System Goals\nand Identify Performance Measures). This occurs in Stage 2, after the CLIOS System\nrepresentation has been developed, and the user better understands the system. Specifying\nsystem goals via performance measures (in Step 6) may lead one to revisit the system goals as\noriginally conceived (in Step 1). Note that this iteration is bidirectional. Upon reaching Step\n6, another review of the checklists in Step 1 will ensure that no relevant characteristics,\nopportunities, issues, and challenges have been omitted from the analysis.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n4.2. Step 2: Identify Subsystems in the Physical Domain and\nGroups on the Institutional Sphere\nTo outline the general structure of the CLIOS System, we determine (a) which major\nsubsystems make up the physical domain of the CLIOS System, (b) who the main actor\ngroups are on the institutional sphere, and (c) how they relate to one another on a macro-level.\nThis is essentially establishing the structure as illustrated in Figure 1. One useful way to\nidentify these subsystems and actor groups is by grouping the issues identified in the first step\ninto different categories. Another approach is to organize the subsystems according to their\ncommon technological characteristics, functions, or how they fulfill the needs of the various\nactor groups on the institutional sphere.\n\nFor the Physical Domain: Our approach to learning about the CLIOS System and organizing\none's ideas about how the system works, is to parse the physical system into subsystems, map\nout the structure of those subsystems (which can be envisioned as layers), and finally identify\nthe key linkages between subsystems. This is a difficult process, but worthwhile in that many\nof the insights into the structure and behavior of the CLIOS System will come through, while\nthinking about how it can be subdivided into the different layers.\n\nFor the Institutional Sphere: We then identify major actor groups on the institutional\nsphere. The general categories may include government agencies, private sector firms, citizen\ngroups as well as independent expert/advisory entities and so forth. This can be derived from\nthe checklists in terms of who manages the system, who is affected by it, who attempts to\ninfluence it, and in general, who worries about it.\n4.3. Step 3: Populate the Physical Domain and the\nInstitutional Sphere\n\nPopulating the Physical Domain: In this step, we employ the type of basic subsystem\ndiagram common in systems sciences, \"defined as having components and relations that may\nbe represented (at least in principle) as a network-type diagram with nodes representing\ncomponents and lines the relationships\" (Flood and Carson, 1993). Initial CLIOS subsystem\ndiagrams are created by detailing each subsystem - for example, passenger transportation,\nland use, the environment, etc. - and identifying the major components in each subsystem and\nthe links indicating influence of components on each other. Sometimes a component can be\ncommon to more than one subsystem. In these cases the component is called a common\ndriver. We will discuss the different types of components later in this paper. Figure 6 shows\nthe populated subsystems and the concept of the common driver linking those subsystems.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nFigure 6: Populating the Subsystem Diagrams7\n\nWhile the subsystem diagrams help to represent the CLIOS System, the use of this type of\ndiagram can quickly reach its limit. There is a cognitive upper bound to the number of\n\"components\" that can be represented within such a diagram, while still providing an\nopportunity for insight for the creator or user of the diagram.8 However, remaining within\nthis cognitive limit can result in oversimplification of the system - that is, too few\ncomponents that are too \"macro\" in nature to be of value leaving some of its subsystems\npoorly represented. One technique that can be used for increasing the resolution of the system\nrepresentation without creating overcrowded diagrams is expanding. Expanding focuses on\ncritical components and magnifies their functions into separate diagrams for more detailed\nstudy. This is shown in Figure 7.\n\nMODELS AND FRAMEWORKS Different representation techniques can\nbe used and depends on the analysts' preferences. For example, Design\nStructure Matrices (DSM) is one alternative to the diagrammatic approach\nshown here.\n\nIt is left to the discretion of the CLIOS Process users to decide which approach is more\nappropriate for their objectives. In this paper, we suggest the construction of system diagrams\nas one way to usefully represent the system, but by no means do we consider this as the sole\nor the optimal method for all CLIOS Process applications. The nomenclature that is\nintroduced here, however, can be useful for communication purposes as a common language\nirrespective of which representation method is used.\n\n7 The reader may notice similarities of the system representation as described in Step 3 of the CLIOS Process and other\nmethods such as system dynamics and object-process methodology (OPM).\n8 From the authors' experience, a single subsystem diagram should contain approximately 20 components--because of\ncognitive limits--although that number may be substantially more or less depending upon the preferences of the analyst.\nSubsystem 1\nSubsystem 2\nSubsystem 3\nSubsystem 4\nCommon Driver\nCommon\nDriver\nComponent\nLink\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

In order to conveniently\nshow the institutional sphere, we flatten the sphere onto a two-dimensional plane. Figure 7\nabove illustrates the tasks described in Step 3 for a transportation example. It shows the\nvarious subsystems selected, the institutional sphere mapped onto a plane for convenience,\nwith the subsystems and sphere populated with components and actors respectively. Further,\nwe then expand those components or actors if the user feels they need greater detail.\n4.4. Step 4A: Describe Components in the Physical Domain\nand Actors on the Institutional Sphere\n\nComponents of the physical domain: Up to this point, the components have been\nconsidered as generic. In this step we more carefully characterize the nature of the individual\ncomponents. Within the physical domain, we consider three basic types of components.\nRegular components (or from now on, simply \"components\" and indicated by circles) are\nusually the most common in the subsystem diagrams within the physical domain. They can\nrefer to concepts such as \"congestion\" or can contain complex internal structures such as\n\"economic growth.\"9\n\n9 Whether these components are broken out in more detail within the main subsystem diagram depends on the focus of the\nCLIOS System representation. Analytic insights may be better gained by \"expanding\" a particular component, as described\nearlier.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nPolicy Levers (indicated by rectangles) are components within the physical domain that are\nmost directly controlled or influenced by decisions taken by the actors -- often institutions\nand organizations - on the institutional sphere.\n\nCommon Drivers (indicated by diamonds) are components that are shared across multiple and\npossibly all subsystems of the physical domain.\n\nIn Figure 8, we show three shapes used for different CLIOS System components. External\nfactors are indicated by shading, rather than by shape, and can still be either a component or a\ncommon driver. Deciding on the type of component, whether it is an external factor, and\nwhether the component should actually be further expanded into greater detail, is not trivial.\nBox 1 provides some heuristics to help the analysts in making these decisions.\n\nFigure 8: Suggested CLIOS System diagram component shapes\ncomponent\npolicy\nlever\ncommon\ndriver\nexternal\nfactor\n\nReturning to the idea of nested complexity, the policy levers are those components that\ndirectly link the actors on the institutional sphere to the subsystems in the physical domain.\nThe common drivers, on the other hand, emerge from the process of dividing the system into\nseparate subsystems. They are important components that \"drive\" the behavior of more than\none of the subsystems. The common drivers are important both for understanding the\nbehavior of the CLIOS System as well for implementing changes to the system (during later\nstages in the CLIOS Process). Many common drivers are also external factors that are\nexogenous to the physical domain. They may constitute major sources of uncertainty, since\nthey impact the physical domain at several different subsystems. The uncertainty of common\ndrivers, for example, population and economic growth, will have to be taken into account in\nany evaluation of strategic alternatives for system improvements.\n\nActors on the institutional sphere: In parallel to describing the components in the physical\ndomain, we also describe the actors on the institutional sphere. In describing the actors, we\ncan identify important characteristics, such as their power or mandate over different parts of\nthe physical subsystems, their interests in the subsystems, their expertise and resources and\ntheir positions with regards to different potential strategic alternatives.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nBox 1: A note on heuristics for scaling and bounding the CLIOS System\n5. \"Think outside of the box.\" Innovative solutions usually lie out of conventional boundaries.\nAvoiding restrictive boundary setting may facilitate better strategic alternatives.\n\nStart by representing the big picture. Detail can be added as needed as the CLIOS Process\nproceeds by using techniques such as expanding or by adding subsystems as necessary.\n\nSystem boundaries can be altered as the CLIOS Process unfolds. It is usually easier to\nnarrow the boundaries than it is to expand them, so think broadly at the outset.\n4. External factors usually influence the CLIOS System unidirectionally. For a typical urban\ntransportation system, the global economy (an external factor) affects the local economy (a system\ncomponent and probably a common driver). No component in the urban transportation system can\nmeaningfully affect the global economy and the global economy is too massive to be affected by the\nlocal economy of a typical urban area.\n3. Ideally, system boundaries should not reflect ideological convictions and preconceived mental\nmodels of the analyst. This is a key reason that a team with members with differing mental models,\nrather than a single analyst, should ideally work on the CLIOS Process.\n2. The boundary of a CLIOS System is also determined by what the analysts consider as feasible\nstrategic alternatives. Therefore some macro-level economic and social factors may well fall\noutside the boundary of the system but would be part of the \"relevant environment\", affecting and in\nsome cases affected by the CLIOS System.. As will be discussed later, scenario building will be one\ntool to think systematically about these linkages between the CLIOS System and the relevant\nenvironment.\n1. The analysis needs to take into account the actual scale of the system (spatial and temporal), and\nthe magnitude and scope of its impacts, physical, economical, political or social. This will not only\ndetermine where the system boundaries are drawn, but also which subsystems and components will\nbe included.\n\nComponents are the units of analysis for the appropriate level of detail - scale - of the\nsystem. For a general transportation system example, vehicles are components and would\nprobably not be analyzed further.\n\nThe scale of the system is determined by whether any meaningful additional insight can be\ngained through further analysis. There is no need to break down cars into auto parts even if\nthese may play a role in the system (e.g. catalytic converters for reducing pollutants) unless\nadditional insight is gained by doing so.\nIn Step 3 of the CLIOS Process we need to begin to explicitly address these questions. These are all\ndifficult questions. Indeed, there is no right answer to them. As Maier and Rechtin note, system\nanalysis is more of an art rather than science; hence, analysts are expected to use heuristics and their\nexperience to make these choices. A second reason is that any answer to these is dependent on the\nscale and scope at which we want to consider the CLIOS System and indeed that can change as the\nanalysis advances. As mentioned previously, these changes are indicative of shifting mental models\nand possibly precursors to important insights (as shown in Figure 4). That being said, there are\nheuristics that the analyst can use to support these decisions. We describe some of these below.\nHowever, caveat emptor - as with all heuristics, they can be contradictory, not universally\napplicable, and certainly the list is not exhaustive.\nAs we introduce the basic concepts of the CLIOS Process' representation stage in general terms,\nthere are many specific questions the reader might ask. Where is the boundary of the CLIOS\nSystem? How does one break up the physical domain into subsystems? When should a component\nin a physical subsystem be expanded into subcomponents? Similarly, when should an organization\non the institutional sphere be broken up into sub-organizations?\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

Step 4B: Describe Links\nAs the components are characterized and divided into different types, we also in parallel need\nto characterize the nature of the several kinds of links. Link notation needs to be consistent; if\nthey represent different things, one should use different diagrammatic components (Flood and\nCarson, 1993). In the diagrams used in the CLIOS System representation, these links will be\nlargely qualitative. Generally, the links should indicate directionality of influence and\nfeedback loops,10 as well as the magnitude of influence (big/important or small/marginal\nimpacts on the adjoining components). Other possible characteristics to include in the notation\nfor the links could be the timeframe of influence (short-, medium-, or long-term lags), the\nfunctional form of the influence (linear/non-linear functions of various forms or threshold\neffects, step functions), continuous or discontinuous (under what conditions the link is active\nor inactive), and uncertainty of the effect of one component upon another (including\nuncertainty in all of the above characteristics).\n\nIn thinking about the linkages, a key aspect of the CLIOS System representation is to develop\na framework for thinking about and describing the links in the system. We identify here three\nclasses of links:\n(a) Class 1: links between components in a subsystem,\n(b) Class 2: links between components in a subsystem and actors on the institutional\nsphere (also called \"projections\"), and\n(c) Class 3: links between actors on the institutional sphere.\nThere are different approaches appropriate to each class of links. Generally the links within\nthe physical domain (Class 1) can be analyzed using engineering- and microeconomics-based\nmethods, and will often be quantifiable. Regarding the links from the institutional sphere to\nthe physical subsystems (Class 2 or projections), quantitative analysis is less useful, since\nhuman agency and organizational and stakeholders' interests come into play as they attempt\nto induce changes in the physical domain. Finally, there are the interactions that take place\nwithin the institutional sphere itself (Class 3). Understanding this class of links requires\nmethods drawing upon theories of organizations, institutions, politics and policy.\n\nWhile the interactions within the physical domain and within the institutional spheres more\nreadily fall under the domain of more traditional disciplinary perspectives, we would argue\nthat the interactions between the institutional sphere and physical subsystems are more\ninterdisciplinary and of particular interest to the evolving field of Engineering Systems.\nBorrowing a phrase from Karl Popper (1972), \"obviously what we want is to understand how\nsuch non-physical things as purposes, deliberations, plans, decisions, theories, intentions and\nvalues, can play a part in bringing about physical changes in the physical world\" (cited in\nAlmond and Genco (1977), emphasis in original).\n\nIn Figure 9 we show some suggested link notation. Components can have weak, average, or\nstrong links to other components. Links can be one way or bi-directional. One can also have\nlinks that are positive or negative in their influence on the other component.\n\n10 We suggest that feedback loops in which one component has a feedback loop directly back onto itself would not be used in\na CLIOS System representation. Instead, the intervening components need to be identified, to provide insight into the chain\nof causality that creates this feedback.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

Can be advisory or hierarchical.\nMass Transfer: Shows flow of materials between two components\nEnergy Transfer: Shows flow of energy between two components\n\nThe exact shape or notation for the components and the links, or the level of detail in\ndescribing the types of links, is solely the decision of the analysts or decisionmaker following\nthe CLIOS Process. What is most important is that the analyst does follow a systematic\nprocess of thinking through and attempting to classify the links in their systems. In that\nmanner, the analysts will learn more about the CLIOS system, and gain intuition regarding its\nstructure and behavior (refer again to Figure 4). The diagrams are not as important as the\nthinking that went into making the diagrams! To quote Edward Tufte. \"The act of arranging\ninformation becomes an act of insight\"\n\nNow, having described our suggested notation for the CLIOS System representation, we show\na CLIOS System representation in Figure 10.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

Step 5: Transition from Descriptive to Prescriptive\nTreatment of System\nAs noted earlier, this step marks a transition from a descriptive to prescriptive treatment of the\nsystem. We move from the initial representation stage to the later stages of design,\nevaluation, and selection, and implementation of strategic alternatives. We hope that some\nimportant insights will resulted about the nature of the CLIOS System under study and have\nemphasized that many of the most important insights about the system behavior will come\nduring the process of creating the diagrams, and the discipline of bringing a systems mindset\nto a large complex system. However, before making the transition to Stages 2 and 3, we offer\nsome questions and mental exercises that can hopefully draw out some additional insights\nregarding the CLIOS System.\n\nOnce the general structure of the CLIOS System has been established, and the behavior of\nindividual components, actors, and links has been relatively well characterized, we can use\nthis information to gain a better understanding of the overall system behavior, and where\npossible, counterintuitive or emergent system behavior. This entails essentially tracing\nthrough the system at its different levels - the physical subsystems and institutional spheres.\nBy tracing through the pathways in the CLIOS System, there are several sources of important\nsystems behavior that can be identified by asking the following types of leading questions.\n\nFirst, with respect to the physical layers (Class 1 links), are there strong interactions within or\nbetween subsystems? Are there chains of links with fast-moving, high-influence interactions?\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nAre some of the paths of links strongly non-linear and/or irreversible in their impact? Finally,\ncan strong positive or negative feedback loops be identified?\n\nSecond, looking at the links between the institutional sphere and the physical subsystems\n(Class 2 links or projections), can we identify components within the physical domains that\nare influenced by many different organizations in the institutional sphere? If so, are the\norganizations pushing the system in the same direction, or is there competition among\norganizations in the direction of influence? Alternatively, do some organizations on the\ninstitutional sphere have an influence on many components within the physical domain?\n\nFinally, within the institutional sphere itself (Class 3 links) - are the relationships between\norganizations characterized by conflict or cooperation? Are there any high-influence\ninteractions, or particularly strong organizations that have direct impacts on many other\norganizations within the institutional sphere? What is the hierarchical structure of the\ninstitutional sphere, and are there strong command and control relations among the\norganizations, and or are they more loosely coupled? What is the nature of interaction\nbetween several organizations that all influence the same subsystems within the physical\ndomain?\n\nIn this stage, rather than attempting to quantify the relationships, the focus should be more on\nsimply \"getting the sign right\" (Marks, 2002) or understanding the direction of change\nthrough a series of complex and uncertain chains of links. Furthermore, here we may also\nbegin to develop a catalogue of issues and possible strategic alternatives for the CLIOS\nSystem. The idea is that in a CLIOS System representation, certain links - fast, large\nmagnitude, irreversible, etc. - should raise a warning flag that there could be a potential\nproblem (or opportunity) arising from this link or sequence of links, forming a loop, which\ncan create a \"vicious\" or \"virtuous\" cycle. In addition to these high impact links or chains of\nlinks, certain components may be pulled in two directions simultaneously by two different\nloops. These loops can be purely within the physical domain, but are also likely to arise when\ndifferent actors on the institutional sphere have an influence on the same components within\nthe physical domain.\n\nThinking carefully through these questions can generate some insights regarding how to\nimprove the system, some of the key uncertainties, and possible implementation issues that\nmay arise. We now move to Stage 2.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n\n5. STAGE 2: DESIGN, EVALUATION AND SELECTION\nHaving considered the CLIOS System from the standpoint of its structure and behavior during\nthe Representation stage, the next stage focuses on the design, evaluation, and selection\naspects of the CLIOS Process. We therefore begin to consider in greater depth the evaluative\ncomplexity of the CLIOS System, in order to identify opportunities for improving both the\nphysical domain and the institutional sphere. This culminates in the development of a robust\nbundle of strategic alternatives. Among these strategic alternatives may be organizational and\ninstitutional changes that may be necessary to meet the CLIOS System goals (defined in Step\n1, and to be reconsidered in Step 6).\n\nAs part of Stage 2, we can also proceed with using the appropriate (quantitative) models\nusing the refined system goals and the identified performance measures as guidance for model\nscope and scale. These models should be validated to evaluate the current state of the system;\nthey will subsequently serve as a basis for comparing strategic alternatives. The models can\nbe the quantitative analog of the qualitative representation built in the representation stage, or\ncan be constructed from scratch simply using insights from the qualitative representation.\nTwo basic model categories can be used: case-specific i.e. models that track limited facets of\nthe CLIOS System on the component or subsystem level (in our transportation example a\ntraffic simulation would be such a model) and system-wide i.e. models that aim to describe\ninteractions at the CLIOS system level (e.g. a system dynamics simulation that combines\neconomic, environmental, and transportation interactions). Ideally, the system-wide models\nshould integrate inputs from the independent models in a system representation consistent\nwith the qualitative insights that are gained from Stage 1.\n5.1. Step 6: Refine CLIOS System Goals and Identify\nPerformance Measures\nEntering the second stage of the CLIOS Process, it is necessary to refine the preliminary goals\ndeveloped in Step 1 to reflect the knowledge and insight gained at this point in the process.\nThe Representation Stage should have revealed the needs and perspectives of the stakeholders\nmore clearly and captured the opportunities and issues of the CLIOS system under study. This\nadditional information can be used to refocus the preliminary goals into a concise normative\nview of what the desired future state of the system should be, and give the analyst an idea of\nwhich goals are attainable and realistic, and which goals may need to be modified in the face\nof reality. The concrete vision of the desired future state of the system, as prescribed by the\nrefined goals, can then be used to identify performance measures that mark the progress from\nthe current to the desired future state. Usually, these performance measures would be\nproperties of components in the physical domain.\n\nPerformance measures for CLIOS Systems are often difficult to define, and it is not\nuncommon that consensus fails to be reached on even how to measure or prioritize different\nperformance measures. In this sense, we are confronted with the evaluative complexity\ninherent in CLIOS Systems. \"Performance\" will depend heavily upon the viewpoint of the\nvarious stakeholders.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nMODELS AND FRAMEWORKS: A useful way of tying together the\nneeds/goals of the stakeholders with the identified performance measures is by\nthe Needs-Metrics Matrix as described by Ulrich and Eppinger.\n\nA\nOne may even find that difficulties in defining performance measures that capture all\nof the phenomena of interest lead one to revisit Step 1, to challenge the initial\ndescription, preliminary goals, and boundaries of the CLIOS System. This is another\nexample of the need to iterate throughout the CLIOS Process.\n\nBox 2: Examples of performance measures in CLIOS System components\nfor the case of urban transportation\nIn the case of urban transportation, certain common drivers such as economic development are\nimportant performance measures for many stakeholders. First, these measures reflect the economic\nhealth of the city. But also economic growth depends in part upon the efficacy of the transportation\nsystem to bring goods to customers, customers to stores, and employees to work. Therefore economic\nhealth can indirectly reflect a well-functioning transportation system. Policy levers can also be\nperformance measures in themselves. For example, the level of investment in public transport can be\nviewed as a performance measure, although it actually measures the financial inputs to the system, and\nnot necessarily the output of that investment (e.g. better roads, cleaner bus fleets). Of course, regular\ncomponents such as congestion or human health, which may not be common drivers or policy levers,\ncan be performance measures as well.\n5.2. Step 7: Identify and Design Strategic Alternatives for\nCLIOS System Improvement\nThe establishment of better refined goals and performance measures naturally leads to\nquestions about how CLIOS System performance can be improved through strategic\nalternatives. This is a creative step in the CLIOS Process where imagination in developing\nstrategic alternatives is to be valued and out-of-the-box thinking and brainstorming is often a\nkey to success. .Considering what kinds of strategic alternatives have worked well in similar\nCLIOS Systems can be helpful. This step is meant to bring out a wide range of (even if only\nremotely reasonable) alternatives. Broad and creative thinking is valued here. Detailed\nevaluation, and selection, (and, of course, elimination) of strategic alternatives will come later\nin Step 9.\n\nPerformance improvements through strategic alternatives can take three forms. Thinking\nabout nested complexity, we can characterize strategic alternatives as:\n-\nphysical changes involving direct modification of components in the physical domain\n(e.g. expansion of a highway or the construction of a new rail line in our urban\ntransportation example),\n-\npolicy-driven changes involving the policy lever projections from the institutional sphere\non the physical domain, (e.g. a vehicle trade-in policy or congestion pricing in the urban\ntransportation example), and,\n-\nactor-based - architectural changes of the institutional sphere either within actors or\nbetween actors (e.g. a structural change in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or\na change in the way the EPA interacts with the US Department of Transportation (DOT)\non the institutional sphere of a U.S. transportation CLIOS System).\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n\nThinking through system performance from the inner physical layers to the outer institutional\nsphere is a more bottom-up systems engineering approach, in which we look first at the\nphysical domain and ask how the subsystems in the physical domain - through changes to the\ncomponents or perhaps, in some cases, changes to the links between components - can lead to\nbetter performance. This approach often leads to more technology-driven strategic\nalternatives relating directly to the physical domain (physical strategic alternatives).\n\nIn many cases, in order to achieve changes in the physical domain, policy-driven strategic\nalternatives need to be considered. These strategic alternatives may rely on incentives or\ndisincentives such as taxes, subsidies, voluntary agreements, and restrictions on certain\nbehaviors. Implicit in these types of alternatives is usually an assumption about how a policy\nchange, initiated by actors on the institutional sphere, will cascade through the physical\ndomain, and what changes in the performance measure will occur. Following this process can\nalso reveal where strategic alternatives of this kind are counterproductive, diminishing the\nperformance in other parts of the system.\n\nFinally, an important part of Step 7 should be to evaluate the institutional arrangements\n(sometimes referred to as the institutional \"architecture\"11) that govern the management of the\nCLIOS System and then devise strategic alternatives that change these arrangements, in order\nsupport the CLIOS System goals. The institutional sphere can be investigated to highlight the\ninterventions that need to be made on the institutional sphere to accomplish those changes to\nthe physical domain (actor-based strategic alternative).\n\nB\nThis is also a step for revisiting the CLIOS representation beginning with Step 2, in\nwhich the subsystems in the physical domain and major actor groups on the\ninstitutional sphere are first identified. As one considers strategic alternatives, it may\nbe necessary to modify some of the earlier CLIOS representation to include additional actors\nor components, or even subsystems and actor groups, that were originally \"left out\" and that\nmay be necessary to achieve specific performance measures and attain CLIOS System goals.\n5.3. Step 8: Flag Important Areas of Uncertainty\nA parallel activity to the identification of strategic alternatives for CLIOS System\nperformance improvements is to look for uncertainties in the anticipated performance of the\nCLIOS System, both at the subsystem and the CLIOS System level. In identifying the\nimportant uncertainties, one can rely on the insights gained in Stage 1 and Step 6, in which we\nlooked for chains of strong interactions, areas of conflict between stakeholders, or emergent\nbehavior resulting from feedback loops. For example, we should look carefully at individual\nlinks or loops that had large magnitude, fast-moving, non-linear or irreversible influences on\nother components within the system.\n\n11 We often use the term \"architecture\" to denote organizational interactions among the actors on the institutional sphere of\nthe CLIOS System. This definition is adapted from Sussman and Conklin (2001), where a regional architecture is defined\n\"as a methodology for designing organizational interactions among the various agencies and private-sector firms that would\nparticipate in providing transportation services of any type at a regional scale\". Indeed, one can consider a regional\narchitecture as a special case of an architecture, where the CLIOS System is a regional transportation system.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nThe common drivers, given their importance to the performance of a CLIOS System, are\nanother key area that can affect CLIOS System uncertainty. Common drivers in our urban\ntransportation example would include GDP and population, both of which can be highly\nuncertain, especially in the long-term. Since these factors can simultaneously influence\ndifferent subsystems in different ways, the overall impact of the common drivers can be\ndifficult to ascertain. Sensitivity analysis exercises can be useful here. These common drivers\ncan have a particularly strong influence on the physical domain when one considers the\nlonger-run evolution of the CLIOS System. For example, whether an economy (a) grows\nonly gradually, with occasional sharp downturns, or (b) suddenly takes off, can radically\ninfluence the entire CLIOS System through changes in demand for goods and services,\nincluding transportation and energy, levels of investment available, changes in land use\npatterns, supply and demand for different types of technologies, and the relative value placed\non the environment and economic growth.\n\nFinally, while flagging important areas of uncertainty, we should also consider the impact of\nexternal factors, such as macroeconomic growth, and national and international political\ntrends that link a CLIOS system to an even broader system. For this reason, we need to use\nmodels and frameworks for understanding uncertainty in open systems.\n\nMODELS AND FRAMEWORKS A promising qualitative methodology for\nidentifying key uncertainties and understanding their impact on the CLIOS\nSystem is scenario planning as developed by Royal Dutch/Shell in the years\nleading up to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Ged Davis, head of Shell's\nScenarios Team, defines scenarios as \"coherent, credible stories about\nalternative futures\" (Davis, 2002). Scenarios are used in the corporate context\nto make decisions in a complex and uncertain environment by fostering a new\nway of thinking about the future and its impact on strategy. Scenario planning\nhas continued to evolve finding applications in a wide range of contexts\nbesides corporate strategy.\n\nQuantitative approaches are of value as well in this step of the CLIOS\nProcess. They include estimation of probabilities for events in the CLIOS\nSystem and the use of risk assessment to identify and quantify their expected\nimpacts. Another way of approaching uncertainty is exemplified by real\noptions used to value flexibility and flexible strategic alternatives. One could\ncreate more flexible strategic alternatives, which could be modified as an\nuncertain future played out. McConnell (2005) describes ways that life-cycle\nflexibility can be integrated into the CLIOS Process.\n\nC\nThis may be another important point for iteration back to Step 2. As uncertainties\nare identified, it may be necessary to reconsider the boundaries of the CLIOS\nSystem, and how the subsystems in the physical domain and groups on the\ninstitutional sphere appear in the CLIOS representation. It may be that subsystems are\ncharacterized in ways that do not help the analyst understand and deal with the key\nuncertainties. One may also find that important groups on the institutional sphere were\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nmissing or poorly characterized. Therefore, revisiting the diagrams in Steps 2 and onward\nmay be useful for better understanding uncertainties.\n5.4. Step 9: Evaluate Strategic Alternatives and \"Bundles\"\nIn this step, the individual strategic alternatives that were generated in Step 7 are evaluated\nusing the models developed in Step 6 or additional models if need be. Also, we can return\nhere to the insights gained in Stage 1. Usually, each alternative is examined with regards to\nhow it impacts the CLIOS System, especially for the performance area(s) that it was designed\nfor. The case-specific models are usually adequate for this evaluation. If the strategic\nalternative is causing the intended performance measure(s) to deteriorate then the strategic\nalternative usually should be withdrawn from further consideration (or perhaps modified).\nFurther, even for strategic alternatives that are narrowly targeted on specific subsystems or\ncomponents, the systemic impacts of all strategic alternatives need to be considered,\nparticularly if specific alternatives targeting one performance measure can spillover to other\nperformance measures producing unintended consequences. The value of flexibility in the\nstrategic alternative design, as identified in Step 8, should also be considered at this point.\n\nMODELS AND FRAMEWORKS: Cost-benefit analysis is a well\nestablished tool for comparing, as one would expect, the costs and benefits of\ndifferent alternatives. This is a well established and common tool, when\napplied rigorously and with an understanding of its inherent limitations\n(specifically, having to reduce a number of disparate costs and benefits to a\nmonetary equivalent).\n\nThe use of trade-off analysis is an alternative approach which allows\ncomparison of strategic alternatives across difference performance measures.\nA large number of alternatives can be compared in this manner, and there is\nno need to reduce performance measures to a single measure. As the name\nsuggests, it allows decisionmakers to clearly see the tradeoffs between\nalternatives across various dimensions of performance.\n\nGiven system complexity, it would be unusual if a single strategic alternative could be\ndeployed and meet CLIOS System goals. In other words, there is no silver bullet for CLIOS\nSystems. However, by combining strategic alternatives into bundles, the analyst may\naccomplish two objectives. First, one can mitigate and/or compensate for negative impacts.\nGiven the interconnectedness of the CLIOS System, improvements along one dimension of\nperformance may degrade performance in other areas of the system. Therefore, one should\nlook for alternatives that can either attenuate those negative impacts, or compensate those\nactors and stakeholders on the institutional sphere that are negatively impacted, by including\nstrategic alternatives that address their needs, even though these alternatives might not have\nmade the initial cut.\n\nSecond, different combinations of strategic alternatives can improve the robustness of the\noverall bundle. We here define robustness as the ability of bundles of strategic alternatives to\nperform reasonably well under different futures. For example, combinations of alternatives\ncan provide insurance against extreme changes or shocks to the system, such as major shifts\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nin the common drivers. The system-wide models from Step 6 and the uncertainty\nconsiderations from Step 8 are critical in the evaluation of bundles of strategic alternatives.\nSeeking a robust bundle is a different approach than that of identifying a so-called \"optimal\"\nbundle, which may only perform optimally under a constrained set of conditions. In fact, we\nargue that achieving \"optimal performance\" is an unrealistic goal for a CLIOS System. Given\nthe range of performance measures involved, different stakeholder views, and trade-offs\nneeded to obtain the necessary support for implementation, simply finding a feasible bundle\n(one that works and can be implemented) may be an achievement in itself.\n\nOne way of displaying robustness is with a matrix, where the columns represent different\nfutures and the rows represent bundles of strategic alternatives; then we can see how the\nbundles perform compared across a range of futures.\n\nTable 3: Performance of Bundles across Different Futures\n\nFuture1\nFuture2\nFuture3\nBundle 1\n+\n-\n++\nBundle 2\n+\n++\n+\nBundle 3\n+\n+\n\nWhere we see positive outcomes in each of the futures (Bundle 2, in the example), that bundle\nis then considered robust. In this case, the choice is straightforward. However, if choosing\nbetween Bundle 1 and 3, this would depend upon the desire to avoid negative outcomes, in\nwhich case Bundle 3 would be preferable, even though Bundle 1 performs well in two out of\nthe three futures, and extremely well in one of the futures. In further developing and refining\nboth strategic alternatives and implementation plans, as will be described below, the focus\nshould be on combining strategic alternatives that can make bundles more robust and\nimplementable across the entire set of possible futures.\n\nWe note that implicit in characterizing the overall \"performance\" of a bundle, is weighing the\nvarious \"performance measures\" identified earlier. Evaluative complexity suggests that\ndifferent stakeholders will see this weighing differently. So while for illustrative purposes we\nrefer to overall \"performance,\" we should realize that agreeing on it will often be non-trivial\nin practice.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\n6. STAGE 3: IMPLEMENTATION\nOnce a bundle of promising strategic alternatives is identified, the next crucial (but often\noverlooked) action is to design a plan for implementation. Many analyses come to an end at\nStep 9 with a list of recommendations, but with little guidance as to what obstacles might\narise in the implementation of the recommended actions, or how the political realities will\naffect the actual deployment.\n\nSteps 10 and 11 (shown as parallel steps) are meant to address this common shortcoming.\nStep 10 focuses on how to implement the strategic alternatives that are related to the physical\ndomain, while Step 11 focuses on how to implement the strategic alternatives on the\ninstitutional sphere. Akin to project management, but at a higher level, the implementation\nplans developed in Steps 10 and 11 would often include deployment budget / financial\nrequirements, actor champion, and contingency planning in case some strategic alternatives\nfail or are not implemented on time. While we separate the two steps to emphasize the need\nto consider both areas, ideally the two steps will create a common implementation plan where\nthe strategic alternatives for the physical domain and those for the institutional sphere are\nmutually supportive.\n6.1. Step 10: Design and Implement Plan for Physical\nDomain/Subsystems\nAs mentioned above, this part of the plan for implementation concentrates on the physical and\npolicy-driven types of strategic alternatives in the physical domain. In developing the plan, it\nis important to consider how each strategic alternative fits with the others. Are they\nindependent or are some prerequisite for the success of the others? Are there enough\nresources to proceed with all strategic alternatives or do additional fund-raising mechanisms\nneed to be considered? Is the projected time horizon for achieving the CLIOS System goals\nreasonable based on the ability to implement each alternative? How is implementation\naffected by failures in meeting the targets of specific strategic alternatives?\n\nAn additional consideration when we create a plan is focusing on all of the performance\nmeasures and the trade-offs among them. Neglecting certain performance measures,\nespecially those measures which are highly valued by certain actors on the institutional\nsphere, can make the bundle deployment vulnerable to strong resistance from groups that feel\nthat their interests are threatened. This highlights another key task in developing a strategy\nfor implementation, which is the use of the CLIOS System representation to identify which\nactor is going to implement, monitor and enforce what strategic alternative (i.e. who will be\nthe champion for each strategic alternative), as well as who has the potential to impede its\nimplementation. These considerations will inform the parallel Step 11.\n6.2. Step 11: Design and Implement Plan for Institutional\nSphere\nStrategic alternatives developed earlier in Step 9 include needed changes to the structure of\nindividual actors (e.g. organizations) and the relationships among them. In Step 11, we design\na plan for implementation of these actor-based changes. Designing a plan for implementation\nrequires a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of the institutional sphere. We\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007. MIT\nOpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY].\n\nESD.04\nCLIOS USER'S GUIDE\nconsider Step 11 to be a parallel activity to Step 10, with a plan for implementing actor-based\nchanges explicitly being a central part of the overarching implementation plan.\n\nWhen creating a plan for how the institutional architecture can be modified along the lines\ndrawn from the actor-based strategic alternatives of the chosen bundle, due consideration\nshould be given to the actors' individual and collective goals. By studying actors on the\ninstitutional sphere to assess how each strategic alternative affects their interests, one can try\nto identify both the proponents and opponents of various strategic alternatives. This\nconsideration is central to Step 11 by returning to the issue of mitigation or compensation; one\ncan consider the building of coalitions that will overcome resistance created from the\nopponents. (See Appendix A on the political science concepts of Olsonian and Stiglerian\nsystem characteristics.)\n\nA well-crafted implementation plan for the institutional sphere notwithstanding, institutional\nchanges may work against the goals of some organizations, and generate not only external\nconflict among organizations, but also internal conflict as organizations attempt to adapt to\nnew institutional interactions. While organizations must \"change internally as well as in their\ninstitutional interactions with other organizations\", it is also true that \"organizations, by their\nvery nature, change slowly\" (Sussman, 2000) and we need to be realistic in our time frames\nfor improving our CLIOS System when changes to the institutional sphere are among our\nstrategic alternatives.\n6.3. Step 12: Evaluate, Monitor and Adapt Strategic\nAlternatives\nFinally, once bundles of strategic alternatives have been implemented, the next step is to\nmonitor and observe outcomes, both in the short and long run. In particular, one should be\ncareful to identify any unanticipated \"side effects\" such as degradation in the performance of\none subsystem due to strategic alternatives targeted at improving a different subsystem.\nIndeed, creating the capability to monitor key aspects of the CLIOS system, its subsystems,\nand their components, can and should be included as part of the plan for implementation in\nSteps 10 and 11.\n\nStep 9 and Step 12 should be considered as complements of one another. While Step 9\nrepresented the ex ante evaluation of how well bundles of strategic alternatives should\nperform, Step 12 represents the ex post evaluation of how well those bundles did perform.\nBecause Step 12 is our final step in the CLIOS Process, it is also a critical point for additional\niteration to earlier steps. We highlight four points of iteration here, starting with the iteration\nback to Step 9.\n\nD\nIf the strategic alternatives failed to achieve improved system performance, one can\nreturn to Step 9, and reevaluate the individual strategic alternatives, or consider\ndifferent bundles of options that can overcome any problems with the original\nbundles that were implemented. For example, if a bundle of transportation options worked\nrelatively well, but did not meet their expected performance measures, one can consider\nadding additional strategic alternatives, perhaps in the area of land use changes, to improve\ntheir performance through supporting strategic alternatives. One may also find that evaluation\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

For example, close observation of\noutcomes will resolve many of the initial uncertainties in terms of how the system\nwill respond to different interventions, both in the physical domain and on the institutional\nsphere. This information can also inform choices regarding future strategic alternatives.\nAfter implementing strategic alternatives and evaluating their outcomes, an analyst can decide\nwhether and how to design new strategic alternatives, or simply modify strategic alternatives\nthat were already considered.\n\nF\nAt this point, we can also use knowledge gained after the implementation of bundles\nof strategic alternatives to once again refine CLIOS System goals and performance\nmeasures. For example, it may be that there were fundamental disagreements among\ndecisionmakers and stakeholders on the performance measures - disagreements that did not\nbecome clear until strategic alternatives were actually implemented. This type of information\n- carefully gathered after interventions - can be extremely valuable in designing future\nstrategic alternatives.\n\nG\nFinally, an important point for iteration is from Step 12 back to Step 5. Again, Step\n5 is where the user makes the critical transition from a descriptive treatment to a\nprescriptive treatment of the CLIOS System. In other words, the question shifts\nfrom \"what do we know about the system,\" to \"what do we do with the system?\" It is also the\npoint at which one can consolidate knowledge and emerging insights regarding the structure\nand behavior of the system. Iteration \"G\" suggests that one has completed the entire CLIOS\nProcess and returns to reiterate the prescriptive stages. This \"second time through\" the\nprocess should reflect a much deeper understanding of and appreciation for system\npossibilities, limits, uncertainties, and sensitivities, and an updating of prior beliefs/models\nregarding system goals, structure, and behavior (as shown in Figure 4). Of course, one's\nperception and understanding of the system may have shifted so fundamentally that it may\neven be worthwhile to return to Step 1, and repeat the representation stage of the CLIOS\nProcess.\n\nSo, while we discuss these four \"feedback loops\" for iteration in the CLIOS Process, there are\nother possible points of iteration. A noted above, one could return to the initial CLIOS\nSystem representation and assess whether certain aspects of the system were missing or\npoorly represented at this stage. Looking first at the physical domain, one could ask if there\nwas any unanticipated emergent behavior that altered the performance of the system or if any\nof the links were mis-specified or functioned differently than expected. One may learn the\nmost from failures in achieving desired goals and performance measures. The lack of\nperformance improvement could indicate a failure to understand the actors on the institutional\nsphere and interactions among them, or poorly designed plans for implementation.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring 2007.

From Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge by Edward O. Wilson:\nThe theme of this book, consilience, refers to the web of interconnection among\ndisciplines -- the ultimate tying together of all knowledge.\nWilson discusses complexity theory, saying that The greatest challenge today, notjust in\ncell biology but in all of science is the accurate and complete description of complex\nsystems. Scientists have broken down many kinds of systems. They think they know the\nelements and the forces. The next task is to reassemble them, at least in mathematical\nmodels that capture the key properties of the entire ensembles. Success in this enterprise\nwill be measured by the power researchers acquire to predict emergent phenomena when\npassing from general to more specific levels of organization. That in simplest terms is the\ngreat challenge of scientific holism.\nWilson notes that the physicists have done this. By treating individual particles such as\nnitrogen atoms as random agents, they have deduced the patterns that emerge when the\nparticles act together in large assemblages, but he says the subject matter of physics is the\nsimplest in science. It will be much harder in biology, he suggests.\nHe defines complexity theory as the search for algorithms used in nature that display\ncommon features across many levels of organization. He says complexity theories, At\ntheir best, they might lead to deep new laws that account for the emergence of such\nphenomena as cells, ecosystems, and minds.\nHe is not convinced about the approach, but is hopeful. He says that some of the elementary\nconcepts like chaos and fractal geometry have been useful in modeling the physical world.\nTo be successful in his field of biology, what complexity theory needs is more empirical\ninformation and some day, perhaps, we will have a true theory of biology.\nWilson also discusses the opportunity of economists to build on biology and psychology.\nHe refers to going from the micro to the macro: The ensemble of processes by which the\nmass of individual decisions are translated into social patterns. I think this bottom-up idea\nwill be terribly difficult to realize, but it is consistent with Wilsons theme of consilience.\n2. From Herbert SimonsThe Architecture of Complexity, Proceedings of the American\nPhilosophical Society, Vol. 106, No. 6, December 1962:\nA number of proposals have been advanced in recent years for the development of general\nsystems theory which, abstracting from properties peculiar to physical, biological, or social\nsystems, would be applicable to all of them. We might well feel that, while the goal is\nlaudable, systems of such diverse kinds could hardly be expected to have any nontrivial\nproperties in common. Metaphor and analogy can be helpful, or they can be misleading.\n\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nAll depends on whether the similarities the metaphor captures are significant of superficial.\nIt may not be entirely vain, however, to search for common properties among diverse kinds\nof complex systems. The ideas that go by the name of cybernetics constitute, if not a theory,\nat least a point of view that has been proving fruitful over a wide range of applications. It\nhas been useful to look at the behavior of adaptive systems in terms of the concepts of\nfeedback and homeostasis and to analyze adaptiveness in terms of the theory of selective\ninformation. The ideas of feedback and information provide a frame of reference for\nviewing a wide range of situations, just as do the ideas of evolution, of relativism, of\naxiomatic method, and of operationalism.\n3.

Complexity as per Joel Moses in his working paper Complexity and Flexibility:\nThere are many definitions of complexity. Some emphasize the complexity of the behavior\nof a system. We tend to emphasize the internal structure of a system. Thus our approach is\ncloser to a dictionary definition of complicated. A system is complicated when it is\ncomposed of many parts interconnected in intricate ways. Let us ignore the near circularity\nof the definition. The definition points out two features of the concept. It has to do with\ninterconnections between parts of a system, and it has to do with the nature of these\ninterconnections (their intricateness). One can use information theory to get at the notion of\nintricateness in the sense that a highly intricate set of interconnections contains much\ninformation, whereas a highly regular one contains far less. For our purposes a simpler\ndefinition will be helpful. We shall define the complexity of a system simply as the number\nof interconnections between the parts.\nOur view of complexity differs from that of the man on the street. Complexity is not an\ninherently bad property to us. Rather it is the coin of the realm in systems. You usually\nhave to expend complexity dollars to achieve useful goals, such as increased functionality,\nefficiency or flexibility. The reason for the word usually above is that there are occasions\nwhen one can greatly simplify the design of a system and produce an equivalent one with\nmany fewer parts and interconnections. We shall exclude such unusual situations. We shall\nbe concerned with the more frequent situation where one wishes to modify an existing\nsystem in order to add functionality (e.g., more seats in an airplane, a new feature in Word),\nor increase efficiency. The ease with which such changes may be accomplished is related to\nthe inherent flexibility of the initial design. Thus we are concerned with relationship\nbetween complexity and flexibility in a given system.\n5. Complexity as per Eberhardt Rechtin and Mark Maier in The Art of System\nArchitecting:\nComplex: composed of a set of interconnected or interwoven parts.\nSystem: a set of different elements so connected or related as to perform a unique function\nnot performable by the elements alone.\nIt is generally agreed that increasing complexity is at the heart of the most difficult\nproblems facing todays systems of architecting and engineering. Systems are simply\ngrowing in complexity -- the biggest cause of cost-overruns.\nThe authors argue that qualitatively different problem-solving techniques are required at\nhigher levels of complexity than at low ones.\nmodel (abstract) the system at as high a level as possible, then progressively reduce the\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nlevel of abstraction. In short, Simplify.\nThis primacy of complexity is system design helps explain why a single optimum\nseldom, if ever, exists for such systems. There are just too many variables.\n6. Detail complexity vs. dynamic complexity as per Peter Senge in The Fifth Discipline: The\nArt and Science of the Learning Organization:\nsophisticated tools of forecasting and business analysisusually fail to produce\ndramatic breakthroughs in managing a business. They are all designed to handle the sort of\ncomplexity in which there are many variables: detail complexity. But there are two types\nof complexity. The second type is dynamic complexity, situations where cause and effect\nare subtle, and where the effects over time of interventions are not obvious.\nWhen the same action has dramatically different effects in the short run and the long (run),\nthere is dynamic complexity. When an action has one set of consequences locally and a\ndifferent set of consequences in another part of the system, there is dynamic complexity.\nWhen obvious interventions produce non-obvious consequences, there is dynamic\ncomplexity.\n7. From Dealing with Complexity: An Introduction to the Theory and Application of\nSystems Science, by Robert L. Flood and Ewart R. Carson, citing Vemuri in Modeling\nof Complex Systems: An Introduction:\nComplex situations are often partly or wholly unobservable, that is, measurement is noisy\nor unachievable (e.g., any attempt may destroy the integrity of the system).\nIt is difficult to establish laws from theory in complex situations as there are often not\nenough data, or the data are unreliable so that only probabilistic laws may be achievable.\nComplex situations are often soft and incorporate values systems that are abundant, different\nand extremely difficult to observe or measure. They may at best be represented using\nnominal and interval scales.\nComplex situations are open and thus evolve over time -- evolution may be understood to\ninvolve a changing internal structure, differential growth and environmentally caused\nadaptation.\n8.\nFrom Frontiers of Complexity: The Search for Order in a Chaotic World, by Peter\nCoveney and Roger Highfield:\nComplexity is the study of the behavior of macroscopic collections of such units that they\nare endowed with the potential to evolve in time.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nThey distinguish between mathematical complexity defined in terms of the number of\nmathematical operations needed to solve a problemand scientific complexity as defined\nabove. Mathematical complexity is the sort of complexity of interest in computer science.\n9. John Sterman, Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex\nWorld.\nHis underlying world view is system dynamics, emphasizing the multi-loop, multi-state,\nnonlinear character of the feedback systems in which we live. He says that natural and\nhuman systems have a high degree of dynamic complexity. He emphasizes that\ncomplexity is not caused simply by the number of components in a system or the number\nof combinations one must consider in making a decision. The latter is combinatorial\ncomplexity, finding the optimal solution from a very, very large number of possibilities.\nBut dynamic complexity can occur in simpler systems with little combinatorial complexity,\nbecause of interactions of the agents over time.\nTime delays between taking a decision and its effects on the state of the\nsystem are common and particularly troublesome. Most obviously, delays reduce\nthe number of times one can cycle around the learning loop, slowing the ability to\naccumulate experience, test hypotheses, and improve.\nDynamic complexity not only slows the learning loop, it reduces the learning\ngained on each cycle. In many cases controlled experiments are prohibitively\ncostly or unethical. More often, it is simply impossible to conduct controlled\nexperiments. Complex systems are in disequilibrium and evolve. Many actions\nyield irreversible consequences. The past cannot be compared well to current\ncircumstance. The existence of multiple interacting feedbacks means it is difficult\nto hold other aspects of the system constant to isolate the effect of the variable of\ninterest; as a result many variables simultaneously change, confounding the\ninterpretation of changes in systems behavior and reducing the effectiveness of\neach cycle around the learning loop.\nDelays also create instability in dynamic systems. Adding time delays to negative\nfeedback loops increases the tendency for the system to oscillate. [An\nexample:] driving a car involve[s] time delays between the initiation of a\ncontrol action (accelerating/braking,) and its effects on the state of the system.\nAs a result, decision makers often continue to intervene to correct apparent\ndiscrepancies between the desired and actual state of the system even after\nsufficient corrective actions have been taken to restore the system to equilibrium,\nleading to overshoot and oscillation. The result is [for example] stop-and-go\ntraffic, Oscillation and instability reduce our ability to control for confounding\nvariables and discern cause and effect, further slowing the rate of learning.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nDynamic Complexityarises because systems are\n- Dynamic: Herablitus said, All is change. What appears to be unchanging is, over a longer\ntime horizon, seen to vary. Change in systems occurs at many time scales, and these\ndifferent scales sometimes interact.\n- Tightly Coupled: The actors in the system interact strongly with one another and with the\nnatural world. Everything is connected to everything else.\n- Governed by feedback: Because of the tight couplings among actors, our actions feed back\non themselves. Our decisions alter the state of the world, causing changes in nature and\ntriggering others to act, thus giving rise to a new situation which then influences our next\ndecisions. Dynamics arise from these feedbacks.\n- Nonlinear: Effect is rarely proportional to cause, and what happens locally in a system\n(near the current operating point) often does not apply in distant regions (other states of the\nsystem). Nonlinearity also arises as multiple factors interact in decision making:\nPressure from the boss for greater achievement increases your motivation and work effort -\nup to the point where you perceive the goal to be impossible.\n- History-dependent: Taking one road often precludes taking others and determines where\nyou end up (path dependence). Many actions are irreversible: You can't unscramble an egg\n(the second law of thermodynamics). Stocks and flows (accumulations) and long time\ndelays often mean doing and undoing have fundamentally different time constants\n- Self-organizing: The dynamics of systems arise endogenously and spontaneously from\ntheir structure. Often, small, random perturbations are amplified and molded by the\nfeedback structure, generating patterns in space and time and creating path dependence.\n- Adaptive: The capabilities and decision rules of the agents in complex systems change over\ntime. Evolution leads to selection and proliferation of some agents while others become\nextinct. Adaptation also occurs as people learn from experience, especially as they learn\nnew ways to achieve their goals in the face of obstacles. Learning is not always beneficial,\nhowever.\n- Counterintuitive: In complex systems cause and effect are distant in time and space while\nwe tend to look for causes near to the events we seek to explain. Our attention is drawn to\nthe symptoms of difficulty rather than the underlying cause. High leverage policies are\noften not obvious.\n- Policy Resistant: The complexity of the systems in which we are embedded overwhelms\nour ability to understand them. The result: many obvious solutions to problems fail or\nactually worsen the situation.\n- Characterized by tradeoffs: Time delays in feedback channels mean the long run response\nof a system to an intervention is often different from its short run response. High leverage\npolicies often cause worse-before-better behavior, while low leverage policies often\ngenerate transitory improvement before the problem grows worse.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

Charles Perrow, Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies.\nPerrow argues that our systems have become so complex and closely coupled that accidents\nare normal and cannot be assured against. He discusses the idea of components being\njoined by complex interactions, so that the failure of one affects many others. He discusses\na common-mode component being used for several purposes (e.g., a pump) so that when\nit fails, a number of difficult-to-predict interactions occur. Further, these components are\ntightly coupled, so that failures propagate though the system quickly (and perhaps not\nvisibly).\nHe uses the word linear to contrast with complex when he describes interactions among\nsubsystems (or components). By linear he means interactions occur in an expected\nsequence. By complex he means they may occur in an unexpected sequence.\nHe says complex systems are characterized by:\n- Proximity of components that are not in a production sequence\n- Many common mode connections between components in a production sequence\n- Unfamiliar or unintended feedback loops\n- Many control parameters with potential interactions\n- Indirect or inferential information sources\n- Limited understanding of some processes\nSo if complex systems have safety issues, why not make them linear? It is because we\nstrive for the performance we can achieve only through complexity.\nTightly coupled systems are characterized by:\n- Delays are not possible\n- Sequence of events are invariant\n- Alternative paths not available\n- Little opportunity for substitution or slack\n- Redundancies are designed in and deliberate\nSo he plots various systems of the following axes indicating a continuum in these\ncharacterizations -- far from binary.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

Interconnections have long time-constants since universities are the\nantithesis of command and control.\nPerrow explains why complex, tightly-coupled systems have normal accidents. Because\nthe system is complex, we need decentralized operations to achieve flexibility if something\ngoes wrong. However, tightly-coupled systems need centralized operations for system\ncontrol. Clearly, we cannot have both decentralized and centralized operations, hence the\ninevitability of normal accidents.\n11.

Complexity in internal management of a system (like the space program) vs. complexity in\nthe objectives of a social system -- the space program had a simple objective -- a man on the\nmoon and back safely by the end of the 1960s. To quote from J. Morley English (ed.) in\nEconomics of Engineering and Social Systems -- It may have been the proper order to\ndevelop the complex management systems first while holding to the straight-forward\nobjective that the space program afforded and only then extending the systems engineering\nmethodology to handle the more complex objectives of social systems.\n13. From Rescuing Prometheus by Thomas P. Hughes:\nSocial scientists and public intellectuals defined the baffling social complexity to which the\nsystems approach enthusiasts believed they could respond as a problem involving\nindeterminacy, fragmentation, pluralism, contingency, ambivalence, and nonlinearity.\nEcologists, molecular biologists, computer scientists and organizational theorists also found\nthemselves in a world of complex systems. Humanists -- architects and literary critics\namong them -- see complexity as a defining characteristic of a postmodern industrial\nworld.\nHughes discussing Jay Forrester as follows:\nForrester warns decision-makers that intuitive judgements about cause-and effect\nrelationships may not be effective in complex feedback systems, such as an urban system,\nwith their multiple feedback loops and levels. Complex systems have a multitude of\ninteractions, not simply cause-and-effect relationships. Causes may not be proximate in\ntime and space to effects: a decision to increase the availability of housing, for instance, can\naffect the level of underemployment years later, not unlike the butterfly/chaos effect. A\nseemingly more proximate cause, such as the shutting down of factories, may hide the\neffects of the earlier decision to build more housing.\n14. Paul Ormerod, Butterfly Economics: A New General Theory of Social and Economic\nBehavior. Ormerod discusses complex economic and social systems and focuses on:\n- The behavior of individuals being affected by other individuals\n- How simple individual rules of behavior lead to complex behavior at the system level\n- The inherent unpredictability of the short-run behavior of economic and other social\nsystems\n- And hence the futility and perhaps counter-productivity of government intervention to\ntry to influence inflation or unemployment (e.g.)\n- Thinking about the economy, not as a machine, but as a biological system\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

From The Economist, June 5, 1999, an article entitled Complex Equations:\nThe article discusses complexity management in the context of banks and insurers,\nreferencing work by Tim Wright of Booz-Allen & Hamilton (BAH).\nConsolidation of these firms brings nightmarish complexity that undoes any cost saving\nor revenue synergies. But why, says BAH. These consolidations are supposed to achieve\neconomies of scale. But while metrics like cost/call fall by 18% as calls double, such\neconomies of scale at the operational level tend to be wiped out by diseconomies of scale at\na firm-wide level. So while makers of ball-bearings, e.g., become more efficient with size,\nbanks and insurers tend not to\nReasonscustomers are not one-size-fits-all, so scale economies are hard to attain.\nInternational operations are all different -- regulations, etc.\n16. From The Social Psychology of Organizations by Daniel Katz and Robert Louis Kahn:\nThe authors note that it is a big mistake to use biological metaphors to describe patterned\nhuman activity. Further the authors say, The biological structures are anchored in physical\nand physiological constancies, whereas social structures are not. So dont use the physical\nmodel, because you will miss the essential social-psychological facts of the highly variable,\nloosely affiliated character of social systems. And a social system has no structure apart\nfrom its functioning (Allport) and is characterized by more variability than biological\nsystems. To reduce human variability in organizations we use environmental pressures,\nshared values and expectations, and rule enforcement.\n17. A. O. Hirschman and C. E. Lindblom, Economic Development, Research and\nDevelopment, Policy Making: Some Converging Views, Behavioral Science, vol. 7\n(1962), pp. 211-22.\nThe authors consider the three fields of interest noted in the title, each of which can be\ncharacterized as a complex system in the social-political-economic realm. They essentially\nargue that in each of these areas (drawing on the work of others), that unbalanced growth,\napparently irrational strategies like duplication of resources and confusion and lack of\ncommunication may in fact be effective strategies in this context. Lindblom (in his earlier\nwork) argues that there is a fallacy in thinking that public policy questions can best be\nsolved by attempting to understand them and that there is almost never sufficient\nagreement to provide adequate criteria for choosing among possible alternative policies.\nHe goes on to discuss what he calls disjointed incrementalism, where no attempt at\ncomprehensiveness is made in policy-making. He argues that comprehensive policy-\nmaking in complex systems will always fail because of value conflicts, information\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\ninadequacies and general complexity beyond man's intellectual capacities.\nSo in looking at these three fields of interest, the authors, in contemplating design and\ndecision-making within these socially-based complex systems, have the following points of\nconvergence in approaches to economic development, research and development, and\npolicy:\n1)\nThe most obvious similarity is that all insist on the rationality and usefulness of\ncertain processes and modes of behavior which are ordinarily considered to be\nirrational, wasteful, and generally abominable.\n2) The three approaches thus have in common an attack on such well-established\nvalues as orderliness (see Hirschman's model of optimum disorderliness),\nbalance, and detailed programming; they all agree with Burke that some matters\nought to be left to a wise and salutary neglect.\n3) They agree that one step ought often to be left to lead to another, and that it is\nunwise to specify objectives in much detail when the means of attaining them are\nvirtually unknown.\n4) All agree further that in rational problem solving, goals will change not only in\ndetail but in a more fundamental sense through experience with a succession of\nmeans-ends and ends-means adjustments.\n5) All agree that in an important sense a rational problem solver wants what he can\nget and does not try to get what he wants except after identifying what he wants by\nexamining what he can get.\n6) There is also agreement that the exploration of alternative uses of resources can be\noverdone, and that attempts at introducing explicitly certain maximizing\ntechniques (trade-offs among inputs or among outputs, cost-benefit calculations)\nand coordinating techniques will be ineffective and quite possibly harmful in some\nsituations. In a sense more fundamental than is implied by theories stressing the\ncost of information, the pursuit of certain activities that are usually held to be the\nvery essence of economizing can at times be decidedly uneconomical.\n7) One reason for this is the following: for successful problem solving, all agree it is\nmost important that arrangements exist through which decision-makers are\nsensitized and react promptly to newly emerging problems, imbalances, and\ndifficulties; this essential ability to react and to improvise readily and\nimaginatively can be stultified by an undue preoccupation with, and consequent\npretense at, advance elimination of these problems and difficulties through\nintegrated planning.\n8) Similarly, attempts at foresight can be misplaced; they will often result in\ncomplicating the problem through mistaken diagnoses and ideologies. Since man\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nhas quite limited capacities to solve problems and particularly to foresee the shape\nof future problems, the much maligned hard way of learning by experiencing the\nproblems at close range may often be the most expeditious and least expensive\nway to a solution.\n9) Thus we have here theories of successive decision-making; denying the possibility of\ndetermining the sequence ex ante, relying on the clues that appear in the course of the\nsequence, and concentrating on identification of these clues.\n18. David Levy, Applications and Limitations of Complexity Theory in Organizational\nTheory and Strategy, Handbook of Strategic Management.\nThe complexity paradigm rejects some key assumptions of traditional neoclassical\neconomics, such as perfect information, diminishing returns, and the implicit existence of a\nsingle rational agent acting on behalf of an organization to maximize some objective\nfunction. ...More pertinent is the behavioral and administrative approach to organization\ntheory pioneered by Simon and Cyert and March, which recognizes that organizations\ncomprise networks of people with bounded rationality.\nphysical systems are shaped by unchanging natural laws, whereas social systems are\nsubject to intervention by cognizant agents, whose behavior is essentially unpredictable at\nthe individual level. Investigations of economic time series by chaos theorists have usually\nassumed that relationships among economic actors are fixed over time. In reality, methods\nof macroeconomic management have changed from the use of the gold standard to\nKeynesian demand management and, later, to monetarist controls. Human agency can alter\nthe parameters and very structures of social systems; indeed, one of the main purposes of\nmanagement is to limit the gyrations of chaotic systems, reduce their sensitivity to external\nshocks, and, in the case of Demming's lean management systems, ensure that behavior is\nnon-chaotic by reducing variability throughout the system.\nImplications of Complexity Theory for Strategy\nA. Long-term planning is impossible\nChaos theory has demonstrated how small disturbances multiply over time because\nof non-linear relationships and feedback effects. As a result, such systems are\nextremely sensitive to initial conditions, making their future states appear random.\nNetworks, even when in the ordered regime, are subject to perturbations from\nexternal influences, which sometimes cause substantial, though unpredictable,\nreconfigurations.\nB. Dramatic change can occur unexpectedly\nTraditional paradigms of economics and strategy, built upon simplified\nassumptions of cause and effect, would suggest that small changes in parameters\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nshould lead to correspondingly small changes in the equilibrium outcome.\nComplexity theory forces us to reconsider this conclusion. Large fluctuations can\nbe generated internally by deterministic chaotic systems, and small perturbations to\nnetworks, even when in the ordered state, can sometimes have major effects.\nC. Complex systems exhibit patterns and short-term predictability\nSocial scientists are generally more interested in the order than the randomness of\ncomplex systems. Short-term forecasting is possible in a chaotic deterministic\nsystem because, given a reasonable specification of conditions at one time period,\nwe can calculate the conditions the next time period.\nD. Organizations can be tuned to be more innovative and adaptive. Rather than\nexpend large amounts of resources on forecasting for unpredictable futures, many\nwriters have suggested that businesses emphasize flexibility, creativity and\ninnovation in response to the vagaries of the marketplace. The idea that organic\nstructures are more effective than mechanistic ones in coping with turbulent\nenvironments, does, of course, have a long pedigree in management studies.\nComplexity theory suggests that organic networks poised on the edge of chaos\nmight give rise to self-organization and emergent order that enable firms to prosper\nin an era of rapid change.\nIt is important to acknowledge that complexity cannot simply be imported from the\nnatural sciences and applied off-the-shelf to industries and firms.\nComplexity theory is not a complete break from traditional organization theory and\nscientific methods, in that it can be seen as a continuation and deepening of systems\nand behavioral approaches to organization theory.\nIn dynamic systems, we seek webs of causation rather than simple linear\nrelationships, and accept the inherent complexity of economic systems rather than rely\non traditional reductionist frameworks.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

Holland, Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity. Holland is from\nthe Santa Fe school of complexity (Gell-Mann, et al.) He starts with basic elements:\nagents, meta-agents and adaptation and the idea of complex adaptive systems (cas). His\nmetaphor is evolutionary biology although his examples are more broadly drawn, such as a\nlarge city. He defines four properties -- aggregation, nonlinearity, flows and diversity and\nthree mechanisms -- tagging, internal models and building blocks. He develops the idea of\nadaptive agents, rules and emergence and finally a software model called echo based on\nsites, resources and strings which he uses on some simple cases to show how organization\nemerges.\nHe agrees we are far from a theory of cas but says a theory will probably be based on\n- Interdisciplinarity\n- Computer-based thought experiments\n- A correspondence principle (Bohr) -- our models should encompass standard\nmodels from prior studies in relevant disciplines.\n- A mathematics of competitive processes based on recombination -- Ultimately, we\nneed rigorous generalizations that define the trajectories produced by the interaction\nof competition and recombination. An appropriate mathematics must depart\nfrom traditional approaches to emphasize persistent features of the far-from\nequilibrium evolutionary trajectories generated by recombination.\n20. W. Brian Arthur, On the Evolution of Complexity-- in Complexity: Metaphors,\nModels, and Reality, G. A. Cowan, David Pines and David Meltzer (eds.).\nArthur speaks about three ways in which systems become more complex as they evolve.\nFirst, he discusses ecosystems (which may be organizational as well as biological in\nnature) in which individuals find niches within a complex web to fill. He uses the pre- and\npost-automobile transportation industry as an example. In the pre- period, buggy whip\nfactories, etc., exploited niches; then the auto was invented and this quickly simplified the\nsystem, only to see it become more complex over time. He cites Newton simplifying\ngreatly the approach of Ptolemy, the latter based on a geocentric model of the solar system\nwith tremendous complexity introduced to make it work. Newton, with a few laws,\ndeveloped the simple ideas which govern the solar-centric model and which had greatly\nsuperior predictive power.\nSecond, Arthur discusses structural deepening, noting that to enhance performance,\nsubsystems are added. This refers to individuals (not ecosystems) becoming more complex.\nThe original design of the gas-turbine had one moving part. Then to enhance performance,\ncomplexity -- subsystems -- were added.\nThird, he discusses complexity and evolution through capturing software like electricity\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nor the mathematics of derivative trading on the financial market.\n21. Stuart Kauffman, At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-\nOrganization and Complexity.\nKauffman is of the Santa Fe School. His framework is biology, primarily. He thinks that\nDarwins chance and gradualism cannot have been enough of a theory of evolution to get us\nwhere we are today. He writes about self-organizing systems as the additional and\nnecessary piece of the puzzle.\nWhile autocatalytic networks arise spontaneously and naturally because of the laws\nof complexity, perhaps natural selection then tunes their parameters until they are in the\nordered regime near this edge -- the transitional region between order and chaos where\ncomplex behavior thrives. After all, systems capable of complex behavior have a decided\nsurvival advantage, and thus natural selection finds its role as the molder and shaper of the\nspontaneous order for free. In the chaotic regime, similar initial states tend to become\nprogressively more dissimilar, and hence to diverge farther and farther apart in state space,\nas each passes along its trajectory. This is just the butterfly effect and sensitivity to initial\nconditions. Small perturbations amplify. Conversely, in the ordered regime, similar initial\nstates tend to become more similar, hence converging closer together as they flow along\ntheir trajectories. This is just another expression of homeostasis. Perturbations to nearby\nstates damp out\nIt is far too early to assess the working hypothesis that complex adaptive systems\nevolve to the edge of chaos. Should it prove true, it will be beautiful. But it will be equally\nwonderful if it proves true that complex adaptive systems evolve to a position somewhere in\nthe ordered regime near the edge of chaos. Perhaps such a location on the axis, ordered and\nstable, but still flexible, will emerge as a kind of universal feature of complex adaptive\nsystems in biology and beyond.\nFurther, what is the source of these properties, this ability to evolve? Is evolution\npowerful enough to construct organisms that are able to adapt by mutation, recombination,\nand selection? Or is another source or order -- spontaneous self-organization -- required?\nIt is fair to say that Darwin simply assumed that gradual improvement was possible in\ngeneral. He based his argument on the selection carried out by breeders of cattle, pigeons,\ndogs, and other domesticated plants and animals. But it is a long, long step from selection\nby hand for alternation in ear shape to the conclusion that all features of complex organisms\ncan evolve by the gradual accumulation of useful variations.\nDarwin's assumption was almost certainly wrong. It does not appear to be the case\nthat gradualism always holds. In some complex systems, any minor change causes\ncatastrophic changes in the behavior of the system. In these cases, as we will soon discuss,\nselection cannot assemble complex systems. Here is one fundamental limit to selection.\nThere is a second fundamental limit as well. Even when gradualism does hold in the sense\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD\nMonth YYYY].\n\nthat minor mutations cause minor changes in phenotype, it still does not follow that\nselection can successfully accumulate the minor improvements. Instead, an error\ncatastrophe can occur. An adapting population then accumulates a succession of minor\ncatastrophes rather than a succession of minor improvements. Even with selection sifting,\nthe order of the organism melts silently away.\nSelection, in short, is powerful but not all-powerful. Darwin might have realized this\nwere he familiar with our present-day computers.\n\nEvolving a serial computer program is either very hard or essentially impossible\nbecause it is incredibly fragile. Familiar computer programs are precisely the kind of\ncomplex systems that do not have the property that small changes in structure yield small\nchanges in behavior. Almost all small changes in structure lead to catastrophic changes in\nbehavior. Furthermore, this problem becomes worse as redundancy is squeezed out of the\nprogram in order to achieve a minimal program to perform the algorithm. In a nutshell, the\nmore compressed the program, the more catastrophically it is altered by any minor change\nin the instructions. Hence the more compressed the program, the harder it is to achieve by\nany evolutionary search process.\nAnd yet the world abounds with complex systems that have successfully evolved -\norganisms, economies, our legal system. We should begin to ask, What kinds of complex\nsystems can be assembled by an evolutionary process?I should stress that no general\nanswer is known, but that systems with some kinds of redundancy are almost certainly far\nmore readily evolved than those without redundancy. Unfortunately, we only roughly\nunderstand what redundancy actually means in evolving systems.\nCite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring\n2007.

Holland, -----------------------------\n----------------.\nHolland is from the Santa Fe school of complexity (Gell-Mann et al.). This is a\ngood little book that captures much useful thinking. He starts with \"basic\nelements\": agents, meta-agents and adaptation and the idea of \"complex adaptive\nsystems\" (cas). His metaphor is evolutionary biology, although his examples are\nmore broadly drawn, such as a large city -- indeed, that is his first example. He\ndefines four properties -- aggregation, nonlinearity, flows and diversity -- and\nthree mechanisms -- tagging, internal models and building blocks. He develops\nthe idea of adaptive agents, rules and emergence and, finally, a software model\ncalled \"echo\" based on sites, resources and strings, which he uses on some simple\ncases to show how organization emerges.\nHe says we are far from a theory of cas, but says a theory will probably be based on\n- Interdisciplinarity\n- Computer-based thought experiments\n- A correspondence principle (Bohr) -- \"our models should encompass\nstandard models from prior studies in relevant disciplines\"\n- A mathematics of competitive processes based on recombination --\n\"Ultimately, we need rigorous generalizations that define the trajectories\nproduced by the interaction of competition and recombination... an\nappropriate mathematics must depart from traditional approaches to\nemphasize persistent features of the far-from-equilibrium evolutionary\ntrajectories generated by recombination.\nOne key idea: adaptable systems become complex!\nRescuing Prometheus, Tom Hughes, Pantheon Books, New York, 1998.\nThis book is an instant classic. It discusses the history of the \"system approach\". It\nincludes fascinating discussions of how large-scale, technological systems --\nincluding the Central Artery/Tunnel, ARPANET, large-scale weapons systems --\nget designed and deployed in political contexts.\nAt Home in the Universe, Stuart Kauffman, -----------------------------.\nSimulation Modeling and Analysis, 2nd edition, Averill Law and W.

He talks about complex systems, and especially\n- The behavior of individuals being affected by other individuals\n- How simple individual rules of behavior lead to complex behavior at the\nsystem level\n- The inherent unpredictability of the short-run behavior of economic and\nother social systems\n- And hence the futility and perhaps counter-productivity of government\nintervention to try to influence (e.g.) inflation or unemployment\n- His scorn for academic economists with their emphasis on \"maths\" and\ntheir lack of concern for testing their findings/models against empirical\ndata\n- The economy, not as a machine, but as more like a biological system\nNormal Accidents: Living with High Risk Technologies, 2nd ed., Charles Perrow, Basic\nBooks, 19--.\nPerrow, a sociologist at Yale, has done the seminal work in this area.
