Here are some general guidelines to follow:\n1. Read the previous financial reports (ex: 10-K, 10-Q reports) for each company. (See below for\nsources to obtain financial reports.)\n2. With your group, calculate the ratio of your choice for the past three years and examine the\ndifferences between your two companies. Speculate on the causes of the major differences\nbetween the two companies. Pose a few questions or hypothetical situations and answer them\nusing the ratios that you have calculated.\n3. The goal of this exercise is to understand the relationship between financial numbers, business,\nstrategy, and enterprise value. It is acceptable if your analysis is not right, and therefore, it is\nnot necessary to consult analyst reports on your two companies. If you do consult professional\nsources, please indicate which parts of your analysis were inspired by those sources.\nEach group must hand in a hard copy of their slides plus email their TA an electronic version of their\nslides by the start of class on October 3rd .\nUndergraduate Group Assignments:\nEach undergraduate (U) group will be required to make a 10-minute presentation.

      "content": "Self-Unloader Dry Bulk Ships Case Study & Questions\nRead the SUL Company case study. For your written assignment, I want you to\ncalculate the premium (expressed as a percentage) that the self-unloader shipowner\nmust charge compared to the owner of a standard bulker. This premium should be\nevaluated for a ship that costs $60 million to build (includes an additional $12 million in\nvessel cost for the self-unloader) and has a daily operating cost (opex) of $8,900. The\npremium must provide an equivalent return on capital (ROC) and return on equity\n(ROE) when compared to the original values for the standard bulker. (See guidelines\nbelow as to how to do this).\n\nIn class we will discuss:\n\n- The above calculation assumes that the self-unloader spends the same time in\nport as a standard bulker. What impact does it have that the self-unloader has a\nfaster unloading rate, and therefore a shorter time in port? How do you quantify\nthis impact?\n- What should SUL Co.'s pricing policy be?\n- From a shipowner's viewpoint, what are the pro's and con's of being a self\nunloader shipowner?\n- Should SUL Co. build the ship described in the case study/spreadsheet?\n- How does the down market affect SUL Co.'s decision?\n\nGuidelines for the SUL Mendoza Investment Model:\n\nTo modify capital costs:\nChange cell F7 from a value of $48,000,000 to $60,000,000.\n\nTo change operating expenses:\nChange cell V8 from a value of $7,000 to $8,900.\n\nTo change the time charter equivalent (TCE) rate:\nThink of the TCE rate as the amount that the shipowner charges for the\nuse of his ship each day. To see the impact of increasing the TCE by X%, change\ncell F17 from 0% to X%. Hit \"Enter\".\n\nFor your homework, just state the PERCENTAGE PREMIUM, plus 3 reasons why you\nthink that SUL Co. will--or will not--be able to obtain this premium.\n\nThis assignment sheet was prepared by Nathan L Pratt and Henry S Marcus as an\nintroduction to working with the referenced investment model. Some information in this\nspreadsheet (the inputs relating to TCE and interest rates in particular) has been\ndisguised\nat the request of the author of the spreadsheet\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n2.96 / 2.961 / 6.930 / 10.806 / 16.653 Management in Engineering\nFall 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Accordingly, there were multiple right answers to some of the sections (for the\neffect on the Leverage Ratio part). The correct answers are marked in Bold and Underlined.\nEach Transaction was worth 4 points (including 1 point for the effect on the ratio).\nYou were required to record ALL the effects of each of the transactions. Recording the ones\nlisted below provides a complete answer. Here are some comments about reoccurring\nmistakes:\n1. Transaction 2B is the end of year adjustment for the prepaid rent expenses.\n2. Transaction 3B is depreciation (End of year).\n3.

The maximum score for a\ncomplete answer for each line is described on the right column. In addition, for every additional\nentry (something that should not appear in this report but you added it anyway) we reduced 1\npoint.\nHere are some comments about reoccurring mistakes:\n1. Since the Income statement includes a loss of 100$ (due to the stolen property) which\ndid not have an effect on cash - you were required to add an adjustment in the Non\nCash adjustments part.\n2. Although it seems the PP&E did not change during the year (Beginning Balance and\nEnding Balance are the same), since we know property in a value of 100$ was stolen\n(reduced the PP&E by a 100$) than we must assume the company purchased additional\nPP&E in the same amount.\n\nPeriod Ending\n3l-0ct-ll\nNet Income\nl00\nNon Cash Adjustments\n\nIncrease in Cumulative Depreciation\nIncrease in Accounts Receivable\n-50\nDecrease in Inventory\nIncrease in Accounts Payable\nDecrease in Other Current Liabilities\n-100\nLoss from stolen property\nMax\nscore:\n0.5\nNet Cash Increase from Operating Activities\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nPurchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment\n-100\nNet Cash Decrease from Investing Activities\n-100\nCash Flow From Financing Activities\n\nPayment of Long Term Loan\n-400\nIssuance of Stocks (Paid in Capital)\nNet Cash Decrease from Financing Activities\n-250\nTotal Increase in Cash during the year 2011\nBeginning Cash Balance\nEnding Cash Balance\n0.5\n25 Total\n\nQuestion 4\nIShareholder's Equity\" was meant to read IShare Capital\", such that you were supposed to add\nall three lines to get $280,000 in Shareholder Equity. However, if you directly used Shareholder\nEquity of $80,000 and made the correct conclusion given that choice, you were not penalized.\nAlso, if you elected to use long-term debt in these ratios instead of the more common total\nliabilities, you should have realized that a one-year loan is not long-term debt. In real life, you\nwould clarify these conditions with your debtors. Also, note that taking a loan provides cash\nassets in addition to showing up as a liability with interest. Up to 5 marks per calculation, 5\nmarks for conclusion. There were 4 possible correct solutions:\nIf equity is $80,000 and debt is considered to be total liabilities, WinBig should choose\nalternative 2 since it is the only possibility:\nTotal Liabilities\n160000+40000+100000+100000*1.05\n1.

Entries\n-\nAdjusting the events that continually occur for which no specific transaction\nsignals the requirement for a journal entry but that still affect the net income\nfor the period and the financial position at the end of the period\n\n-\nAdjusting entries prepared at the end of the accounting period change the\nbalances in the general ledger accounts so that all revenues and expenses\nare recognized\n\n-\nFor example,\n\n- Recognition of accrued revenues and receivables\n\n- Recognition of accrued expenses and payables\n\n- Allocation of prepaid operating costs, e.g. prepaid insurance cost\n\n- Recognition of Depreciation\n\n- Correction of errors, etc.\n\n(1) Allocation of prepaid insurance cost\n-\nKing's Shoe Store paid $1,500 on January 1, 2000, for a three-year insurance\npolicy - Transaction #8\n\n-\nDuring the year 2000, one-third of the coverage expired, so $500 of the\npremium should leave the asset account on the balance sheet and become an\ninsurance expense, reducing income and retained earnings.\n\n-\nIn other words, the balance sheet on December 31, 2000, should show only\n$1,000 of prepaid insurance as an asset.\nTransaction\nNumber\nAccounts\nDebit\nCredit\nInsurance Expense (SE)\nPrepaid Insurance (A)\n\nTransaction\nNumber\nAccounts\nDebit\nCredit\nInsurance Expense (SE)\nPrepaid Insurance

as time passes. Therefore, accounting spreads\nan asset's cost over the periods of the assets' estimated useful life.\n\n-\nThe term depreciation refers to the charge made to the current operations for the\nportion of the cost of such assets consumed during the current period. The\nstraight-line method is widely used for depreciation calculations\n\n-\nKing's Shoe Store's internal records show that annual depreciation is $30,000\nper
