  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nSeminars: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nStudents must have completed\n14.01 Principles of Microeconomics\nbefore taking this course.\n\nCourse Description\n\nWhat is the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth and development? How does energy security affect geopolitical relations among nations as well as socioeconomic relations within nations? This seminar will cover some of these timely and complex questions linking infrastructure and energy and their technologies. We will examine efforts in economically developing and developed nations to build, finance, and regulate infrastructure systems, technologies, and services, particularly those affecting energy security. We will explore how infrastructure is defined, financed, and delivered; how infrastructure, technologies, and innovations are intertwined; how infrastructure supports the energy system and its technologies; and how different countries face the challenges of energy security. Students will think about how the current worldwide economic and energy crises can be an opportunity for making fundamental changes to improve collapsing infrastructure networks and technologies and to attain energy sustainability.\n\nAssignments and Grading\n\nASSIGNMENTS\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\n4 two-page reaction papers\n\n50%\n\n1 25-page final research paper\n\n40%\n\nClass Participation\n\n10%\n\nThe final research paper, not exceeding 25 pages (double spaced) should be on a topic related to energy infrastructure. Students will present a summary of their papers during the last week of the term. Emphasis is on the quality of the writing.\n\nAcademic Misconduct\n\nPlagiarism and cheating are both academic crimes. Never (1) turn in an assignment that you did not write yourself. (2) turn in an assignment for this class that you previously turned in for another class, or (3) cheat on an exam. If you do so, it may result in a failing grade for the class, and possibly even suspension from the college. Anyone caught cheating in any way will be reported to the provost in line with recognized university procedures.",

In addition to the reading responses, each graduate student in the class needs to make one\npresentation during the semester. Undergraduate students are welcome to present, and\nthey can substitute this presentation for one of the reading responses.\n2. The content of the presentation has to be related to the theme of the class session during\nwhich the student will present.\n3. The presentation will follow the \"Pecha-Kucha\" format (usually pronounced in three\nsyllables like \"pe-chak-cha\" and devised by Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham of Tokyo's\nKlein-Dytham Architecture (KDa), in 2003): the student will present 15 slides in 5\nminutes. That is on average 20 seconds per slide, but the time spent on some slides can be\nshorter or longer than the others, as long as the total is kept within 5 minutes. Only\ngraphics are allowed in the slides, no text. (If some graphics contain a few words, that is\nfine though.) The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session with\nfellow students and instructors for 10 minutes.\nIf you need more tips on the \"Pecha-Kucha\" presentation, please visit\nhttp://www.aqworks.com/2007/07/03/pecha-kucha-nights-guide-to-better-presentations-\nskills/\n4.\nPlease let the TA and instructors know at least two weeks in advance when you would\nlike to present.\n\nAnd... enjoy the process! We hope this would be both fun and effective learning\nexperience for you.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n11.165 / 11.477 Infrastructure and Energy Technology Challenges\nFall 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Understanding Response Papers1\nDefinition\nA response paper communicates your intellectual reactions to an idea in the articles and papers we\nread for class. Much like a book review, the response paper usually provides your overall point of\nview regarding the material read.\nSteps to writing a good response paper\nWriting good response papers is demanding. You need not only to read the text but also to\nunderstand and express an opinion about it, including how different ideas relate to one another.\nResponse papers require you to synthesize the intellectual work of others -‐-‐-‐ that is, integrate the\nideas.\n1.\nAs you write only highlight the most important points discussed in the article and think\nwhether or not you agree with them. Why would it be important (or not) for other people to read\nthis article? Who should read it? What are its implications for the subject at hand?\n2.\nAfter you read, think about the argument you want to make in your response paper. Your\nresponse should cover the most important and most interesting ideas to which you will respond.\nBe selective.\n3.\nIn the response paper, argue convincingly whether or not the article:\n(a)\nhas a clear central claim;\n(b)\nis good enough to be thoroughly analyzed;\n(c)\nis coherent or ambiguous;\n(d)\nis simplistic or fails to cover significant issues or questions, thus is irrelevant;\n(e)\nis based on strong assumptions and/or does not present persuasive evidence to support the\nmain assumption(s) or argument;\n(f)\nis contradicted by other authors' theories or your own.\n4.\nWrite the response paper using the standards for any academic paper (i.e., excellent spelling\nand grammar, special attention to quotations and citations, double spacing, standard one-‐-‐-‐inch\nmargins, and legible font size).\n5.\nDo not just summarize the text(s). You are supposed to be reacting or responding to them,\nnot repeating what they say. If there is no analysis involved, then you have not responded, only\nregurgitated.\n6.\nIf there are things in the article that you do not understand, do not gloss over them. Try to\nfind out what the author(s) mean. If you still cannot make sense of an argument in a text, then it\nmay be the case that the argument does not, in fact, make sense. If that is the case, point it out in\nyour paper.\n1 This text has excerpts from materials prepared by the Duke University Writing Studio and the\nUniversity of South Dakota Academic Advising Center\n\nStructure of a response paper\n1.\nIntroduce the major theme in the first paragraph of the response paper and organize and\nunify your arguments around that theme. Do not just respond to the issues discussed in the paper's\nintroduction and conclusion because this is a rather transparent strategy to avoid reading the\npaper. Instead, pay special attention to overarching themes as well as specifics.\n2.\nIn the following paragraphs (i.e., the body of your response paper), discuss the issues where\nyou agree or disagree with the author(s), explain your position, evaluate the evidence the author(s)\nprovides/provide, and give examples. Be specific and detailed. Connect the evidence to your major\ntheme. If you are responding to multiple articles, you may compare and contrast the authors based\non your major theme. Be sure to cite the page when you are using specific ideas or quotes. Your\nthoughts or beliefs, should you decide to include them in your discussion, must be supported by\nfacts and logic. Consider both sides of issues at stake. If the author(s) is (are) on one side of an\nissue, consider the other side. If the author(s) offers (offer) both sides of an issue, consider where\nagreements and disagreements lie and what each side's strengths and weaknesses\nare. Indicate omissions, and raise counterarguments when you detect arguments that are not well-‐-‐-‐\nsupported.\n3.\nConclude your response paper by summarizing your reaction and setting out your ideas\nabout the significance of the article, as well as its implications.\nProper formatting, grading, and submission instructions\nYour response paper should be two-‐-‐pages, double-‐-‐spaced in standard Arial font, 12-‐-‐-‐point in size,\n8.5\" x 11\" paper, 1-‐-‐-‐inch margins all around. Figures (not required but can be included) should not\nbe included in this page count. References must be included.\nEach response paper will be worth 5% of the overall grade. You should bring a copy of your\ncompleted assignment to class and be prepared to share your work with your classmates.\nUse MIT writing resources\nThis seminar requires that you have the ability to communicate your ideas effectively in writing. If\nyou have difficulty writing in proper English, you should seek assistance at the MIT Writing and\nCommunication Center. Meet with the instructors if you have questions about the paper, but we\nwill not read a draft of the paper before it is due.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n11.165 / 11.477 Infrastructure and Energy Technology Challenges\nFall 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
