  "course_description": "This course covers theories about the form that settlements should take and attempts a distinction between descriptive and normative theory by examining examples of various theories of city form over time. Case studies will highlight the origins of the modern city and theories about its emerging form, including the transformation of the nineteenth-century city and its organization. Through examples and historical context, current issues of city form in relation to city-making, social structure, and physical design will also be discussed and analyzed.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Overview\n\nThe class is an examination of the physical and social form of cities. Cities achieve form over time, and while their temporal attributes are stressed in the class, it not a systematic account of the history of cities. Instead, lectures focus on the theories, both normative and functional, which have motivated and still inform the construction of cities.\n\nTopics are categorized into three sections. The first examines the nature of city form theory through examples of traditional attempts to specify \"goodness,\" recent attempts to explain how cities perform, and selected systematic claims on city form theory. The second section focuses on the modern city from its genesis in northern Europe in the late eighteenth-century and discusses in detail the inventions that created it and formed the basis of the contemporary city. The third section attempts to build on the previous sections by concentrating on current theory and practice, in particular on city form process, spatial and social structure, and form models.\n\nStudents are given required and background reading material for each session as well as an overall general bibliography.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n11.001J / 4.250J Introduction to Urban Design and Development\n(for undergraduates), or\n\n11.301J / 4.252J Introduction to Urban Design and Development\n(for graduates)\n\nGrading\n\nStudents enrolled in the course, whether for 9 credits or 12 credits, are required to submit a term paper at the end of the semester. Details, requirements, and resources are provided under\nTerm Paper\n.\n\nGrades are given based on this paper assignment as well as attendance and participation during lecture. Because of the nature of the material presented, students are encouraged to question the theories presented to them and also provide thoughtful insights and analysis through their class participation.",

I.e.,\nthe perception of adaptability is in itself important (and perceived adapt\nability may have psychological value, even if never used).\nPrediction and\ndissemination both entail cost:! of their o~m. On the other hand, \"there are\ndistinct benefits in adapting, or costs in not doing 60.\nThe costs and bene\nfits\"will accrue to differe~t people, of course.\nThere may also be social, political and psychological coots: apparent waste,\ndisorientation, uncertainty, a characterless or unstimulating environment.\nAn extremely adaptable or responsive environ=nt would pr,,:'ably be intolerable.\nThe stability of the large physical environment ~~y be one of its assets.\nDesign stratcgies may reduce SOCl!! of the pol:i.tical IILd psychological costs\nof adaptability (the location of pe=ncnt sY;.-.bolic land:::arks in a shifting\nIB:ldscape, for elcaICplc).\nIn sc:::e c~es, it =y be an objecti\",e to reduce\nacaptability, i.e., to icpose arbitrary c~rtainty by increasing the cost of\nfuture adaptation (lOfo\"revt!r wild lO )\", or to reduce future choices to a few\nmanageable possibilities.\nSystematic m2asu=cs of adapr.~bility could \"be useful in programming, in \"\nde9ign, in cost-bene£it evaluation, in managecent, in mskin; decisione.\nt<.easurcs are likcl:: ':0\ni.;~ used L\"l an incremental ;:0:.1 (which alternative has\nthe more adaptability?), or in satisficing (the ccst of adaptation must\nnever be higher \"than SOlr.e arbit:-ary figure, or a certain degree of indi\nvidual manipulation must always\n\"~e possible). P:'cgrams might state the\nmaximum allowable cost for adapting to some likely succcssor use, or for\nrestoring the site to its previcus condition. Or there might be more spe\ncific physical rules, i.e., \"to every unit of 1000 square feet of floor\napace, it must be possible to\n\" ~ake a 50~ addition without disru?ting any\nother area.\" Random perturbations might be used. to test simulated proposals.\nKevin Lynch\nMay 1976\n\n1,'V;- o.{'''' ~/Y;?'?~~ hi?\")'\n. 1\no~02')V- ~jv-P OY~\n,\n(/'1\n(r \\)\n-t'~\nU\ni/\n'I;' I L=tlr7k?1;r~~ A~V-'1\n~\"\"iJ ''J li'1'2p!7J ?,rr~t?-§-t'}7J ?!'em (lYl? fn?\nI '\"\n,:}PI' ??7rr~ rr!';Z'O 117/\"{(671 1 '\nh)/lO\",.\n\" -imp r/? -w ?-J/r''7l?:?~ \"'v 'UJ-:~) Cr?~\n',\n..,.A,/.\"f)\n-n ~-\" '~'\n\" !(.if\nf\nI t! 1\n7 r?r:J- t Y Uv ni)\nt;/YZr/lvi/).-v.?I~qV;-;\"? r ?'/)d?/t 12.
