This is what harmony means\n.\n\n--Zoltan Kodaly_, Selected Writings_\n\nThe Kodaly Philosophy of music education is known among musicians worldwide for its inclusive points of view: Music is for everyone; no person is complete without music; the best approach to musical genius is through the instrument accessible to nearly everyone - the human voice; everyone can learn to sing in tune; authentic folk songs provide a body of masterpieces by which we can be led to the masterpieces of renowned composers; all musicians, whether novices or professionals, must aspire to develop their ability to hear with the inner ear the music which is on the page, and to express from the heart. It is due to this frame of mind that our approach to the Fundamentals of Music is based upon the Kodaly Philosophy. You can read more about the Kodaly Philosophy at the Web site of the\nOrganization of American Kodaly Educators\n.\n\nWhile principles of musical notation are central to the course, we consider 21M.051 to be a skill-building course. In that regard, our goals include creating an environment in which the student can be encouraged to sing in tune, enabling the student to train her/his music literacy and inner hearing, and making music musically. Please be reminded that such skills are best learned under the guidance of a live teacher who possesses the experience necessary to evaluate your skill level and inspire your growth.\n\nEligibility\n\nStudents who have already taken 21M.301 or 21M.302 may not enroll in 21M.051.\n\nRequired Course Tools\n\nDuckworth, William.\nA Creative Approach to Music Fundamentals\n. 9th ed.
