Four questions, long debated by historians, will receive close scrutiny:\n\nWhat caused the war?\nWhy did the North win the war?\nCould the South have won?\nTo what extent is the Civil War America’s “defining moment”?",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nSyllabus Archive\n\nThe following syllabi come from a variety of different terms. They illustrate the evolution of this course over time, and are intended to provide alternate views into the instruction of this course.\n\nFall 2010, Merritt Roe Smith (\nPDF\n)\n\nFall 2007, Merritt Roe Smith (\nPDF\n)\n\nFall 2005, Merritt Roe Smith (\nPDF\n)\n\nDescription\n\nFocus: Although attention will be devoted to the causes and long-term consequences of the Civil War, this class will focus primarily on the war years (1861-1865) with special emphasis on the military and technological aspects of the conflict. Four questions, long debated by historians, will receive close scrutiny:\n\nWhat caused the war?\n\nWhy did the North win the war?\n\nCould the South have won?\n\nTo what extent is the Civil War America's \"defining moment\"?\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nThis class will operate more like a reading seminar than a traditional lecture class (though a few lectures will be delivered during the term). Students are expected to participate in class discussions by reading the assigned materials by the date they are due. To guide class discussions, students are asked to prepare brief 1.5/2-page reflection papers (6 in all, as designated below) for each set of readings during the term. Please note that the final reflection paper topic is intended as an exercise in comparison and interpretation. Now is the time to start to think about how you want to frame it. Specific instructions about these assignments and how to do them will be discussed in class.\n\nIn addition to the reflection papers, there will be two (2) reading quizzes during the term. The final grade will be determined as follows:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nReflection Papers\n\n50%\n\nQuizzes\n\n50%\n\nNote: Regular attendance, participation, and a good attitude are essential. Without all three, you will not get much out of this course. Attendance will be taken and poor attendance will result in severe final grade penalties. Class participation is particularly important because it can determine your final grade in borderline situations.",

      "content": "Introductory lecture Prof. M. R. Smith\nCivil War & Reconstruction\n\nWHAT IS HISTORY?\n\nA. Common definitions of history\n\nB. The idea of many pasts\n\nC. Ways of studying the past\ne.g. history as past politics\n\n\" \" social processes/social conflicts (cf. Karl Marx)\n\n\" \" as the story of human progress (cf. Daniel Boorstin)\n\n\" \" as the story of war (the Civil War)\n\nD. History as an interpretative discipline\n1. E. H. Carr on what constitutes a historical fact\n2. Theories of history: some examples\na. G. F. Hegel\nb. Karl Marx\nc. F. J. Turner\nd. Lewis Mumford\ne. Thomas Kuhn\n\nE. Lines of interpretation in the history of technology\n1. Technology as the history of expanding knowledge/expanding systems\n(example: Thomas P. Hughes)\n2. Technology as a social force (example: Lynn White's stirrup thesis)\n3. Technology as a social product; the social construction of technology\n(example: David Noble; Donald MacKenzie)\n4. Technology as a social process\n(example: Anthony Wallace's Rockdale)\n\nF. What does all this have to do with the Civil War?\nIt is simply to say that interpretation matters. The readings and films you will be\nviewing this term present different historical interpretations of the Civil War. I\nwant you to pay attention to them and tease out these differences (see last\nassignment re. \"who got it right?\")\n\nIn fact, we are going to start out backwards so to speak by reading David\nDonald's little about Why the North Won the Civil War, so we can reflect on that\nquestion as we move through the term and all the complexities of the larger\nconflict that we will encounter. So bear in mind that history is an interpretive,\nopen-ended subject. Quite apart from the war itself, one of the primary objects of\n\nthis class is to learn how to differentiate between varying interpretations of the\npast, evaluate them, and come to a conclusion about which ones best stand up to\nscholarly scrutiny. These are tools that will come in handy in whatever\nprofessional field you choose to pursue in life."
