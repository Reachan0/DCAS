  "course_description": "15.431 Entrepreneurial Finance examines the elements of entrepreneurial finance, focusing on technology-based start-up ventures and the early stages of company development. The course addresses key questions which challenge all entrepreneurs: how much money can and should be raised; when should it be raised and from whom; what is a reasonable valuation of the company; and how should funding, employment contracts and exit decisions be structured. It aims to prepare students for these decisions, both as entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. In addition, the course includes an in-depth analysis of the structure of the private equity industry.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nRequirements\n\nThe course requires the concepts and skills developed in\n15.402 Finance Theory II\n, which is a pre-requisite. Other courses that may fulfill the pre-requisite requirements are\n15.414 Financial Management\nor\n15.415 Finance Theory\n. Some knowledge of option pricing will also be needed in a few instances. Because we will be linking financial concepts to other business concepts your broad MBA training will also come in handy.\n\nThis course places a strong emphasis on presentation and discussion skills. It will be important for you to explain your positions or arguments to each other and to try to argue for the implementation of your recommendations.\n\nCourse Overview\n\nThis course will use a combination of case discussions and lectures to study entrepreneurial finance. The course is targeted to budding entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. There are five main areas of focus:\n\nBusiness Evaluation and Valuation\n: Here we will give you some tools to valuate early stage business opportunity. We will also review the standard tools of valuation applied to start-up situations and introduce the venture capital method and the real options approach to valuation.\n\nFinancing\n: In this module, we will highlight the main ways that entrepreneurs are financed and analyze the role of financial contracts in addressing information and incentive problems in uncertain environments.\n\nVenture Capital Funds\n: We will look at the structure of venture capital funds and their fund raising process. This module will include issues of corporate venture capital and private equity funds in emerging market economies.\n\nEmployment\n: We will study the issues of attracting and compensating employees in start-ups.\n\nExit\n: We will discuss how founders should exit. Should they sell to another company, take it public, or continue independently as a private company?\n\nCarl Stjernfeldt (General Partner at Castile Ventures) will co-teach a number of sessions. We are very lucky to have Carl participate so please use his time judiciously! We also have a number of additional guest speakers who will discuss recent developments in the industry.\n\nMaterials\n\nA number of case studies are required for this course. The following two texts are optional materials:\n\nLevin, Jack S.\nStructuring Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Entrepreneurial Transactions\n. Aspen Publishers, 2009. ISBN: 9780735581609.\n\nMetrick, Andrew, and Ayako Yasuda.\nVenture Capital and the Finance of Innovation\n. Wiley, 2010. ISBN: 9780470454701.\n\nDeliverables and Procedures\n\nThis course is designed to be challenging and time-consuming. You should expect to prepare an average of one case per week. Each case will come with guideline questions. Students are required to submit a two-page memorandum on the cases. Students can (but are not required to) work in teams of no more than four. You have the option of not handing in two cases during the semester.\n\nThe memorandums should be typed and double-spaced. They should be written as if you were presenting it to your business partners (be they your fellow entrepreneurs or investors). The two-page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memoranda will not be accepted after the class has met. Grading of the memoranda will be on the bases of check marks. The grades on these memorandums tend to help on the margins, moving students up or down half a grade.\n\nClass attendance is critical to the learning process. Because this is such a new area of academic inquiry, there are no textbooks from which to distill all the critical information. The learning will come from struggling together to come to a better understanding of the key issues in the case. Also, because this is a new course, your input is particularly valued as we learn together.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass participation\n\n25%\n\nMemoranda\n\n25%\n\nFinal exam (not available on MIT OpenCourseWare)\n\n50%\n\nThe final exam will be an in-class exam and will be held during the exam week. The exam will be open book but no computers, cell phones or PDAs will be allowed during the exam.",

To determine\nthe Equity Value subtract the market value of debt (the present\nvalue of interest payments).\nCost of Capital for All-Equity Firm (k)\nk = risk-free rate + β * market risk premium\n→Risk-free rate = Long-term bond rate\n→beta = \"unlevered\" beta of comparable firms in\nthe industry\n→βU = βL* E co / [Eco + Dco]\n→Market risk premium = 7%\n\nWhere Can We Find Beta?\n- Standard to look at publicly-traded comparable\nStandard to look at publicly traded comparable\nfirms in same industry.\n- But often there aren't many that are in similar stage\nof development.\n- Later stage companies will tend to have lower\nbetas (all else equal) than early stage companies\nb\nt\nt\ni\nl\nt\nbecause start-up expenses in early stage\ncompanies (e.g. R&D) tend to be more fixed than in\nlater stage companies.\nTerminal Value Calculation\n- Run out Free Cash Flows until they reach a stable\nRun out Free Cash Flows until they reach a stable\npattern\n- Assume a growth rate of g% from then on; use\nconservative growth rates\n- The terminal value formula is:\nTV = FCF*[1+g] / [k-g]\nPV(TV) = TV / [1+k]n\n\nWrinkles on Standard APV Calculations\n- Company may not have taxable income for many years.\n→ Tax rate in these years is 0. Tax losses can be carried forward\nfor up to 15 years to lower taxable income in profitable years.\n→ What discount rate should be applied?\n- Interest expense is not deductible in years when the\ncompany has tax losses.\n→ Carry forward interest expense to years when it can be\ndeducted (up to three years carry forward).\n- Explicit modeling of idiosyncratic uncertainty is\nExplicit modeling of idiosyncratic uncertainty is\nparticularly important.\n→ Take expected value of cash flows over various scenarios\nAPV Example: Medical Diagnostics, Inc.\n\"Medical Diagnostics, Inc\"\n($000)\nRevenue\n6,475\n22,445\n55,960\n110,402\nCost of Goods Sold\n2,406\n7,175\n16,723\n32,564\nR&D\n1,191\n1,343\n1,665\n3,555\n8,630\nSales and Marketing\n2,517\n4,908\n8,805\n16,815\n25,745\nRegulatory and Clinical\n1,199\n1,345\n1,595\nOther Expense\n2,137\n3,397\n4,733\n6,740\n9,394\nTotal SG&A\n6,549\n10,552\n16,402\n28,455\n45,364\nEBITDA\n(6,133)\n(6,483)\n(1,132)\n10,782\n32,474\nDepreciation\nEBIT\n(6,317)\n(6,817)\n(1,676)\n10,203\n31,751\nTaxes\n\n10,858\n\nDepreciation Addback\nCapital Expenditures\nNWC\n(364)\n1,410\n6,416\n16,316\n32,315\nCh I\nNWC\nCh.

No taxes until year 5; use accumulated net tax\nlosses from previous yyears to offset taxable income in yyear 5.\n- Equity Value. In general we subtract a measure of the market\nvalue of debt (MVD) at the time of the initial valuation to get equity\nvalue. Here it is zero; so enterprise value equals equity value.\n- Terminal Values and Growth Rates. Note that we have assumed\nrelatively slow terminal value growth rates: 3% or 7%. Still, the\nvalue of the business in the second case is nearly twice that of the\nfirst case. Most of the value of this firm comes from the terminal\nvalue!!\n→ Model cash flows explicitly until the firms is in steady state\n→ This may be reasonable if there is IP protecting profits or\nbarriers to entry, but we need to be careful\nThe Venture Capital Method\nThe Standard calculations:\n- Step 1: Forecast sales or earnings for a period of years\nStep 1: Forecast sales or earnings for a period of years.\n- Step 2: Estimate the time at which the VC will exit the\ninvestment (typically through an IPO or sale to strategic buyer).\n- Step 3: Value the exit price based on an assumed multiple of\nearnings or sales or customers, etc. The multiple is typically\nbased on comparable public companies or comparable\ntransactions.\n- St\nStep 44: Di\nDiscount it intteriim cashh flflows andd exitit vallue att rattes\nranging from 25% - 80%.\n- Step5: Determine the VC's stake\n.\n\nExample: MIT.com, Inc.\n- Step 1: Forecast Sales or revenues\nYear 0 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5\nEarnings\n-5\n- Step 2: Assume company exits after 5 years\n- Step 3: Assume that the company will have earnings of 5 and it\nwill g\np\no public at a multipple of 20x earninggs for a value of $100M.\n- Step 4: Valuation at 50% Discount Rate\n→ Post-money = $100M/(1.50)5 = $13.2M\n→ Pre-money value = $8.2M\nExample: MIT.com (cont.)\n- Step 5: VC share\n→ VC will ask for 5/13 2\n38 0% equity stake to invest $5M\nVC will ask for 5/13.2 = 38.0% equity stake to invest $5M\n→ Assume N0= 1M shares outstanding prior to financing.\nHow many new shares, N1, does the VC get?\n→ N1/(N0+ N1 ) = s\nN1 = 1 -\ns\ns N 0\n→ N1 = 0.612M shares\n→ Stock price = $5M/0.612M = $8.17\n\nStock Option Pool\n- If the firm needs to reserve 15% of the equity (by the exit date)\nt\nit\nt t\nth\nd t\ndj\nt th\nb\nto recruit management team, then we need to adjust the number\nof shares. The VC still gets 38% of the equity.\n- If m is the stock option pool percentage, and Nm is the number\nof shares issued to the stock option pool, then we know that the\nshares issued to the VC and the option pool (N1+ Nm) are:\ns + m\nN 0\n1 -s -m\n- The shares held by the VC investor, N1, are then:\ns\nN\n1 -s -m\nStock Option Pool (cont.)\n- Thus in our example:\n→ N1 = 0.38/(1 - 0.38 - 0.15) * 1M = 0.809M shares\n→ Nm = 0.15/(1 - 0.38 - 0.15) *1M = 0.319M shares.\n→Price per share is $6.18.\n\nNew Investor in Follow-on Round (with\nLower Discount Rate)\n- Forecast Earnings\nYear 0 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5\nEarnings\n-5\n-3\n- New investor (discount rate of 30%):\n→ Values company at end of year 2 at $100M/1.33 = $45.5M\n→ Requires share, s2, $3M/$45.5M = 6.6% of firm in second\nround.\n→ First-round VC still requires 38% of firm at exit, but will start\noff with more shares and greater percentage (which will then\nbe diluted).\ns1\nN 1 = 1 - s1 - s2 - m N 0\nNew Investor in Follow-on Round (cont.)\n- Initial VC:\n→ N1 = 0.38/(1 - 0.38 - 0.066 - 0.15)* 1M= 0.941M;\n→ p1= $5M/0.941M=$5.33\n- Follow-on Investor:\n→ N2 = .066/(1 - 0.38 - 0.066 - 0.15)*1M=0.163;\n→ p1= $3M/0.163M=$18.40\n- Option Pool\n→ Nm=0.15/(1 - 0.38 - 0.066 - 0.15)*1M = 0.371M\n\nN\nN\nN\nNew Investor (cont.)\n- Note that the first round VC investor starts off with a 40.7% equity\nq\ny\nstake, which then gets diluted to 38% ownership when the second\nround VC investor comes on board.\n- If development time slips by two years then the second round\ninvestors require 11.1% equity share, since their valuation at this\npoint is $26.9M = 100/1.35. If we still have to give 15% in option\npool, this implies that:\nN 2 = 1 - s\ns\n- m ( N 0 + N 1)\nwhich is (0.111/(1 - 0.111 - 0.15))*1.940M = 0.291M shares.\n- The first-round VC ends up with only 35.8% of the shares at the\nexit date and the IRR on the investment falls to 32.5% from 50%.\nComparable Multiples For Exit Values\n- Find exit values by looking at similar companies\nFind exit values by looking at similar companies\n→ Take multiples of EBITDA, sales, customers, eyeballs etc.\n- Strength:\n→ Tells you what the market thinks about growth potential.\n- Weaknesses:\n→ Tells you what the market thinks about growth potential\nTells you what the market thinks about growth potential.\n→ May be hard to find real comparable firms at similar stages that\nare already public and for whom data are available.\n\nCaveats About Multiples\n- Industry Cycles\n→ Young industries might have high multiples for firms that enter\nYoung industries might have high multiples for firms that enter\nthe market today, since they have first mover advantage\n- Mean Reversion\n→ High multiples for firms that enter the market during a \"hot\"\nmarket need not apply for firms that go public in a few years\n→ How well can you \"market time\"?\n- Vesting Period\n→ IPO multiples overstate gains due to long term under-\nperformance\n→ Choose your multiples wisely!!\nWhy Are Discount Rates so High?\n- Such high discount rates cannot be explained as\nSuch high discount rates cannot be explained as\nbeing a reward for systematic risk.\n- In most practical cases, CAPM would give discount\nrates well below 25%, let alone 80%.\n- Th\nThree (li(limitited)\nd) \"\"ratitionalles\"\":\n→ Compensate VC for illiquidity of investment;\n→ Compensate VC for adding value;\n→ Correct for optimistic forecasts and idiosyncratic risk.\n\nRationale I: Investments Are Illiquid\n- Investments in a private companies cannot be sold\nInvestments in a private companies cannot be sold\nas easily as stock in public companies.\n→ All else equal, this lack of marketability makes private equity\ninvestments less valuable than easily-traded public\ninvestments.\n- Caveat: How much less valuable?\n→ Practitioners in private equity investments often use liquidity\ndiscounts of 20%-30%, i.e., they estimate the value to be\n20% to 30% less than an equivalent stake in a publicly\ntraded company.\nRationale II: VC Adds Value\n- VCs are active investors and bring more to the deal\nthan just money:\n→ spend a large amount of time,\n→ reputation capital,\n→ access to skilled managers,\n→ industry contacts, network,\n→ and other resources.\n- A l\nA large didiscountt ratte iis a crudde way tto compensatte\nthe VC for this investment of time and resources.\n- Caveat: Why not compensate the VC explicitly for\nservices?\n\nRationale III: Optimistic Forecasts\n- VC method assumes that the firm hits its targets\nVC method assumes that the firm hits its targets.\n→ Forecasts tend to rely on cash flows in the best case\n- A higher discount rate is a crude way to correct\nforecasts that are too optimistic.\n- Caveatt:\n→ Build uncertainty into the cash flow estimates\n→ 80% of 0 is still 0\n→ This is not the time to be lazy!\nRationale IV: VC Market Power\n- Valuations are influenced by the distribution of\nValuations are influenced by the distribution of\nbargaining power between VC and entrepreneur\n→ Affects the rent distribution between VC and entrepreneur\n- Factors that influence bargaining power:\n→ Supply and demand for capital;

It reflects the average investor's\nvaluation of the probability distribution of future stock prices\n\nUsing Option Pricing Methodologies to\nValue Real Options?\n- How do we translate key variables into real options?\n-\nrf = Time value of money\n- t =\nLength of time till option has to be realized\n- K = Expenditure required to acquire project assets\n- σ = Riskiness of project\n-\nS0 = Present value of project\n\nHow to Get Variables for Option Pricing\n- Use DCF valuation analysis to get present value\n- Use scenario analysis to get volatility of present value\n→ Need to make assumptions about probabilities of various\noutcomes\n→ Need to make assumptions about the cash flows under\ndifferent scenarios\n→ If you have volatility of comparable company you might be\nable to use these. But rarely available\n\nDifficulties in Applying Option Pricing\nMethodologies to New Ventures\n- Present value of project? Riskiness?\n→ Underlying project is not traded and therefore its market\nvalue is not immediately known\n→ Returns might not be normally distributed\n→ Real options lead to real decisions! These affect the future\nvalue of the project itself\n\nOption Pricing in the Case of Focal\n- Find risk neutral probabilities\n→ Market value of project is 39.0. This is the discounted value\nof the expected payoffs in the low and and high markup\nstates assuming a probability of 0.5 for each state and a\n16% discount rate.\n→ The risk-neutral probabilities are given by:\nπ * (137.0) + (1 - π) * (-59.0) = 39.0 * (1.07)2\n→ So, π = 0.54\n- Present value of the Focal option:\n→ PV= (0.54 * 137.0 + 0.46*0) / (1.07)2 = 65.6\n\nDecision Analysis vs. Option Pricing\n- The Option Pricing Method gives a higher valuation than the\nDecision Analysis Method (65 vs. 50).\n- Note that you need the same information to price the options\nusing both methods.\n- Both methods have their drawbacks\n→ The Option Pricing Method assumes that there is arbitrage\nwhen there clearly isn't\n→ The Decision Analysis Method discounts payoffs using\nCAPM-based discount rates which assume that payoffs are\nlinear.\n\nWhat to Do\n-\nIt is important to spot the option and to get some rough sense of its\nvalue.\n-\nUnderstand what is the critical part of the existing project that\ngenerates the real option\n→ Real options have to be embedded in the first step, otherwise you\ndo not need the first part. Then it is not a real option anymore but\nan opportunity!\n-\nBe careful when pricing real options with the Black & Scholes formula\n→ Volatility of underlying project is difficult to estimate\n→ Misestimating the volatility of an option can severely affect its value\n\nWhat not to do\n- Don't use options opportunistically: Sometimes people use real\noptions as ex post justification of bad investment decisions!\n- \"This business may look bad, but it gives us options to get into\nbetter businesses.\"\n→ A bad project is still a bad project. Avoid it if you can!\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.431 Entrepreneurial Finance\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

If there are initially 600,000\ncommon shares outstanding, then own 40% of the common stock\non conversion.\n→ In this case, will convert if .4*V>$2M or V>$5M (ignoring\naccrued dividends).\n- Automatic Conversion\n→ VC must convert at an IPO provided the IPO price is greater than\nsome multiple of the initial conversion price.\n→ The median multiple is 3.0; it is higher for early stage deals (4.0);\nlower for later stage deals (2.7)\n\nPayoffs from Convertible Preferred\nSlope=1\nSlope=%common\nFV: Face value of\npreferred stock\nCV: Min. enterprise\nvalue at conversion\nFV\nCV=$5M\n\nParticipating Convertible Preferred\n- Convertible preferred with extra feature that \"in the event of\nliquidation or sale\" the holder gets face value plus equity\nparticipation.\n→ Redeemable preferred + common stock if the company is\nliquidated (including private sale but not IPO). In our example,\nwould get $2M and 40% of the company.\n→ Convertible preferred if company goes public. In our example,\nwould get $2M or or 40% of the company.\n→ In this case, convert if .4*VIPO > $2M + .4*(VSALE-$2M)\n(ignoring accrued dividends).\n\nPayoffs from Participating Preferred\nSlope= % common\nSALE\nIPO\nSlope=1\nFV of\nFV: Face value of\npreferred\npreferred stock\n\nPayoffs from Participating Preferred\n(Assume a Maximum Sales Price)\nSlope= % common\nSALE\nIPO\nSlope=1\nFV of\nSale\npreferred\n\nEvolution of Preferred Stock Over Time\n- 1970s: Security of choice - Redeemable preferred\n→ Often in combination with common stock\n→ Not many IPOs\n- 1980s: Security of choice - Convertible preferred\n→ Active IPO market\n→ Large increase of funds flowing into VC industry\n- 1990s: Security of choice - Participating convertible preferred\n→ Many later stage investors paid very high prices\n\nDo these Pay-off Structures Matter?\n- No, in the world of Modigliani-Miller!\n→ Just alternative ways of slicing up the pay\n- Yes, in the real world\n→ High-powered incentives for VCs to add value\n→ High-powered incentives for entrepreneurs create long-term value\n\nThe Role of Preferred Stock\n- Preferred feature aligns incentives of entrepreneur with VC to\nstrive for large payoffs\n→ Limits returns to the founder for modest outcomes - incentives to\nreach high payoffs\n- The extent to which the VC wants to encourage the entrepreneur\nto go for the big payoffs can be controlled by specific choice of\nsecurity. Redeemable Preferred + Common Stock >\nParticipating Convertible Preferred > Convertible Preferred >\nCommon Stock > Minimum wage\n\nRelation of Deal Structure and Implied\nFirm Value: Convertible Preferred\n- VCs typically derive the \"post-money\" (\"pre-money\") value of\na firm based on the terms of the convertible preferred contract.\n→ If, for example, the VC invests $2M in the above convertible\npreferred contract (which converts into 40% of the firm's common\nstock), then VC will say that the post-money value is $2M/.4 =\n$5M and the pre-money value is $3M ($5M - $2M)\n→ Alternatively, if the VC method comes up with a value of $5M\npost-money, and the investment is $2M, then the VC method\nchooses a % ownership, s, such that s*$5M = $2M. Here s is 40%.\n\nWhy this Approach is Problematic\n- Ignoring the liquidation value has two implications:\n→ Because investors get 100% of the firm in liquidation, if the firm\nhas value in liquidation, they need less equity upon conversion to\ncompensate them for their initial investment.\n→ Because investors get 100% of the firm in liquidation, the implied\npre- and post-money valuation that is offered to the entrepreneur is\noverstated!\n\nWhy these Concerns are Important\n- The approach ignores the value of the downside protection\nprovided by the preferred feature of the security.\n- This affects the implied value that the VC offers:\nNumber of Cost Value Avg. %\nInvestments\nValue/Cost\nWrite-Offs\n40 10.1%\nBelow Cost\n225 37.8%\nAt Cost\n187 100.0%\n1-5x\n382 1164 3059 262.8%\n5-10x\n242 1713 709.5%\nOver 10x\n206 3703 1797.6%\nTotal\n1004 2790 8927 320.0%\n- If firm is liquidated below cost, average recovery is 26.8% of\ncost; if liquidated at or below cost average recovery is 38.4%.\n\nAn Example to Make the Point\n- Assume the VC invest $2M. And value of the firm at IPO is V* with\nprobability 0.5 and is liquidity for V=$1M with probability 0.5. What\nis the implied value V* the VC is offering based on the deal terms of a\nconvertible preferred contract?\n- In order for the VC to earn a market return on her investment:\n$2M = 0.5*40%*V* + 0.5*100%*$1M,\nThe implied value V* is $7.5M.\n- In contrast, to break even under common stock we would need:\n$2M = 0.5*40%*V + 0.5*40%*$1M\nThe implied value is $9M\n\nA Systematic Approach to Backing out the\nImplied Value, V*\nSlope=1\ns=Slope=0.4\nA\nB\nFV: Face value of\npreferred stock\nCV: Min. enterprise\nvalue at conversion\nFV=$2M\nCV=$5M\n\nConvertible Preferred as a Series of Options\n- Option (A): V if V < FV; FV if V>FV. Thus,\nmin(V,FV) = V - max(V-FV,0)\n= V - max(V-2,0)\nEquivalent to buying the stock and selling a call with a strike price of 2.\n- Option (B):\n= s*max(V-CV,0)\n= 0.4*max(V-5,0)\nEquivalent to buying 0.4 calls with a strike of 5.\nOption (A) + Option (B) = V - max(V-2,0) + .4*max(V-5,0).\nGet V if V<2; 2 if 2<V<5; and 0.4*5 if V>5.\n\nBacking Out V* Using Option Pricing\n- We know that if the VC is getting a market return:\n$2M = Value of Option (A) + Value of Option (B).\n- If we know the risk-free rate (rf) and the strike prices (FV and\nCV), and take a guess at the maturity (T) and the volatility of\nthe investment (σ). The only thing we don't know is V*. All we\nneed to do is reverse engineer the Black Scholes formula.\n- Thus, suppose rf=5%, FV=2, CV=5, T=3, and σ=50%.

The balance of the financing\nwill be allocated to new investors.\n→ In current environment: Preferred automatically converts to\ncommon if investors do not participate in dilutive financing\n\nParticipation Rights\n- First Refusal Rights\n→ Rights to purchase shares proposed to be sold by any shareholders\n- Preemptive Rights\n→ Gives investors the right to buy new shares offered by the firm in\nlater financing rounds\n→ Rights end at time of IPO\n→ In current environment: Right to invest 2x pro-rata ownership in\nlater round\n\nControl Rights\n- Entrepreneurs wants to have control over the development of the\nbusiness\n→ Control is most important when the company is growing\n- VC wants to ensure high returns on the investments\n→ Control is most important when things are not going well\n- The goal is to structure contracts as to allocate control to the\nparty that has more benefits and expertise in using it\n→ Voting Rights/Board Representation\n→ Protective Provisions\n\nControl Terms\n- Voting Rights\n→ Preferred holders vote as if they had converted their holding into\ncommon shares\n→ Just before they go public: VCs control votes in 57% of deals,\nwhereas entrepreneurs control votes in 23% of deals. Neither has\ncontrol in 20% of the deals.\n→ If performance and vesting targets are not met, VC increases\ncontrol in 72% of the cases\n- Board Representation\n→ Average size of board is 5\n→ VCs get 41.5% of seats on average; entrepreneurs get 34.7% on\naverage; outsiders the remainder.\n\nControl Terms\n- Protective Provisions (Class Voting Rights)\n→ Approval of preferred holders is required for\n→Sale, merger, or liquidation of company\n→Changes in corporate charters\n→Major acquisitions or budget changes\n→Appointment or termination of CEO etc.\n→ Allows investors to prevent any actions by management that\nmaterially change the business risk of the company\n\nMile Stones\n- Performance Contingencies: Historically in about 44% of\ndeals, some aspect of the contract is contingent on financial or\nnon-financial performance measures\n→Voting control to VC if EBIT below some threshold\n→Share vesting contingent on FDA approval\n→\"Earn-ins\": Earn equity by meeting value goals\n→Additional funding conditional on completing a new\nbenchmark\n- In current environment: Majority of closings includes\nmilestone based tranches\n\nExit Provisions\n- Tag-Along\n→ If an offer is made for a shareholder's shares, that offer must be\nextended to other shareholders (VC)\n- Drag-Along\n→ Right to force all shareholders to sell company upon board and\nmajority shareholder approval\n- Co-Sale Right\n→ Allows VC to exit at the same rate and time as a founding\nshareholder\n\nRegistration Rights\n- Stipulate the extent to which preferred versus common stock\nwill share equal/preferential treatment when the stocks have\nbeen converted and participate in an IPO\n- Demand Rights: Allow investors to demand that the company\ngoes public even if management does not want to\n- \"Piggy-back\" Rights: Allow investor to include his shares\nalong side with company in an IPO\n- Lock-up Provision: Specifies the period until shares vest\n→ Often determined by the underwriter\n\nGoal of Employee Terms\n- Compensate employees for taking risk and hard work\n- Provide incentives to encourage superior performance\n- Retain talent in the company\n\nEmployee Terms\n- Reserved shares\n→ Pool of shares that can be given to employees for\nincentives/compensation reasons\n→ Typically represents 10%-15% of total fully diluted capitalization\n→ Usually require board approval\n→ Shares issued in excess of the allotted pool trigger anti-dilution\nprovisions\n- Non-competes\n→ Investors want ensure that key employees do not leave to form\ncompetitive firm\n→ Time period of non-compete: 1-2 years\n\nStock Restriction Agreements\n- Vesting of founders' shares\n→ \"Golden hand-cuffs\": Prevents sale of stock before a certain date\n→Four years on the East Coast, three years on the West Coast\n→ Vesting normally occurs quarterly\n→ In current environment: Moving to four year vesting\n- Right to buy back unvested shares of entrepreneur at original\npurchase price, if he leaves the company\n- Accelerated vesting for certain (top) managers in acquisition\n→ Avoid hold-up problems\n\nStaged Capital Commitment (SCC)\n- VCs fund companies in multiple \"rounds\":\n→ Seed stage\n→ Start-up\n→ Early stage\n→ Expansion .....\n- Rounds tend to be shorter early on and in high-tech industries.\n- The capital invested tends to increase in later rounds.\n\nThe Dual Roles of SCC\n- Control Mechanism\n→ Entrepreneur has to come back to VC for funding at several points.\nAllows investor to monitor the firm and to shut it down (i.e. not\nfund it) if the success probabilities are poor.\n→Option to abandon!\n- Signaling and Screening\n→ Entrepreneurs who are confident about their prospects will want to\ndefer raising capital until the firm has passed some milestones.\n→ SCC allows the entrepreneur to issue equity at a more favorable\nprice and enables VCs to screen among entrepreneurs.\n\nExample: SCC as a Control Mechanism\n- Mit.com needs:\n→ $10M to get things off the ground\n→ $20M a year from now for further development of the business.\n- Next year, news about firm's prospects will have come out:\n→ Good news (2/3 prob.): Certain success => $150M payoffs\n→ Bad news (1/3 prob.): 1/10 chance of success ($150M payoff) and\na 9/10 chance of failure ($0 payoff).\n- If bad news comes out, efficient not to invest $20M to get\nexpected payoff of $15M.\n\nExample: Financing without SCC\n- Suppose company raises $30M all at once, up front.\n- The entrepreneur will always choose to invest at both stages if\nhis next best job is not very good (even when it is economically\ninefficient) and he'd have to return the $20M if he didn't invest.\n- In exchange for $30M, VC will demand 28.5% of the equity, as\n28.5% * (2/3 * 150 + 1/3 * .1 * 150) = 30\n- Entrepreneur is left with 71.5% of the company.\n\nExample: Financing with SCC\n- Assume:\n→ Entrepreneur raises $10M now, extra $20M if good news realizes.\n→ If bad news comes out, he does not raise money.\n- Solve backwards:\n→ If good news comes out, sell 13.3% of firm to raise $20M (=\n13.3% * 150)\n→ In start-up stage, company is worth 2/3 * 150 = 100, sell 10% of\nthe company to raise $10M.\n- The entrepreneur sells only 23.3% of company.\nNote: The initial round investor has to own more than 10% of the company initially in anticipation of getting \"diluted\" in\nthe subsequent round. For example, if initially there are 1000 shares owned by E, first round investor buys 130\nshares (owning 13.4% of company) and second round investor buys 173.9 shares.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.431 Entrepreneurial Finance\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

To determine the\nEquity Value subtract the market value of debt.\n\nGenerate cash flows:\n- Value after-tax cash flows to all-equity firm / investment:\n→ Start with free cash flows to all-equity firm\n- For start-ups:\n→ Generate different scenarios\n→Expect substantial non-linearity\n→Assign probabilities to the different scenarios\n→ Value company as expected value of different scenarios\n\nThe Venture Capital Method\n- Step 1: Forecast sales/revenues to equity for a period of years.\n- Step 2: Estimate the time at which the VC will exit the\ninvestment (typically through an IPO or sale to strategic buyer).\n- Step 3: Value the exit price based on an assumed multiple of\nearnings or sales or customers, etc. The multiple is typically\nbased on comparable public companies or comparable\ntransactions.\n- Step 4: Discount interim cash flows and exit value at rates\nranging from 25% - 80%.\n- Step5: Determine the VC's stake\n\nWhy are Discount Rates so High?\n- Such high discount rates cannot be explained as being a reward\nfor systematic risk. In most cases, CAPM would give discount\nrates well below 25%, let alone 80%.\n- Three (limited) \"rationales\":\n→ Compensate VC for illiquidity of investment\n→ Compensate VC for adding value\n→ VC market power\n→ Should not use high discount rates to correct for overoptimistic\nprojections, better build it in cash flow scenarios\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of methods\n-\nAPV\n\n→ Strengths\n→Model cash flows as coming from specific set of operating\nstrategies / assumptions\n→Can see impact of changes in strategies on valuation\n→Valuation tied to fundamentals\n→ Weaknesses\n→Difficult to know right market risk premium and risk factor\n→May leave things out?\n→Strategic value?\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of methods\n- VC method relies on market multiples\n→ Strengths\n→Implicitly uses market consensus of real options\n→Market prices may capture \"missing\" values in DCF\n→Helps to free ride on market's research capabilities?\n→ Weaknesses\n→Cannot always (if ever) get close comparable\n→Firm-level idiosyncrasies\n→Changes in strategy\n→Problem in overheated market: Herding\n→Mean reversion\n\nConclusion: Valuation\n- The different methods are not mutually exclusive\n- VC method and comparables are important but\n→ Do not tell you where value comes from\n→ Whether comparables are really comparable\n- DCF analysis (+ Real options) forces to justify valuation but\n→ Only as good as the data input\n→ Relies on imperfect models\n- Go back and forth between the two approaches\n\nVenture Capitalist as Intermediaries\n- VC himself faces agency issues with regard to his LPs\n→ Limited partners have very little control over GPs once the money\nhas been invested\n→ Large information asymmetries between GPs and LPs\n- VCs objectives:\n→ Maximize financial returns to justify the risk and effort of the\ninvestment for their LPs (GP compensation is largly based on\ncarried interest)\n→ Building own reputation to facilitate fundraising for later funds and\nimprove deal flow\n→ Eventually achieve \"liquidity\", since fund has limited lifetime\n\nStructure of compensation\n- Base compensation as a % of committed capital (or assets under\nmanagement) plus carried interest\n→ Management fee: 1.5% - 2.5% of capital\n→ Carried interest: 20% share of profits\n- Positive:\n→ Induces effort\n→ Attracts talented individuals (really?)\n- Negative:\n→ Huge incentives and potential for opportunism:\n→ Increasing fund size\n→ Changing deal mix\n\nPotential conflict of interest between VC\nand entrepreneur\n- The split of financial returns\n- The allocation of control rights\n- Perception/valuation of future success rate of the company\n→ Uncertainty\n→ Asymmetric information and moral hazard\n- The time horizon of the venture and the type of liquidation event\n\nLogic behind the term sheet is to mitigate\npotential conflicts between the two parties\n- Financial returns divided to:\n→ Reward investors for their investments in the firm\n→ Provide high-powered incentives to entrepreneurs to maximize\nvalue and stay with the firm\n→ Provide VCs with incentives to add value\n- Dynamic allocation of control:\n→ Gives more control to entrepreneur if things turn out well\n→ Gives more control to VC if things do not turn out well\n- Provides incentives to achieve a liquidity event\n→ Prevents entrepreneur from settling for \"life-style\" firm\n\nMost VC contracts have conversion and\nredemption features\n- E.g. Convertible preferred can be converted at the shareholders'\noption into common stock at a pre-specified conversion price\n→ Preferred feature aligns incentives of entrepreneur with VC to\nstrive for large payoffs, since it limits returns to the founder for\nmodest outcomes. The extent to which the VC wants to encourage\nrisk taking by the entrepreneur can be controlled by specific choice\nof security. Redeemable Preferred + Common Stock >\nParticipating Convertible Preferred > Convertible Preferred >\nCommon Stock > minimum wage\n→ Conversion allows VC to participate in the upside. It also reduces\nVC control once the company is a success, since de facto control\ngoes back to management\n\nExample: Convertible preferred payoffs\nSlope=1\nSlope=%common\nDon't convert\nV: Liquidation Value\nFV: Face value of\npreferred stock\nCV: Min. enterprise\nvalue at conversion\nFV\nCV\nV\n\nFinal Exam: The Rules\n- An individual effort\n- Open book: Use any materials from course\n→ Do not bring in outside historical or industry info\n→ Final has all the information you need - it's made up anyway!!\n→ You can use excel for valuation purpose\n→But do not blame me if your laptop crashes!\n- What you cannot use:\n→ Mobile devices, Ipad, Pda etc.\n→ Your neighbors' brains\n\nThe Exam should be:\n- Clearly label your calculations and spell out any assumptions\nthat are non-obvious\n- Write short and price answers, no need for long\n→ Do not \"fish around\" for an answer\n- Put name on cover page only\n→ We grade them anonymously\n\nADVICE ?\n- Exams should address the issues raised in the questions\n- Be very clear about what you are assuming and calculating\n!!!!!

      "content": "Todd Chow knew the search for a well qualified CEO for his favorite portfolio company,\nSecursiv Networks, would not be easy. Secursiv is a Boston based network security\nsoftware company that has developed a very good product and has gained some initial\nrevenue traction. After a rather lengthy process, exhausting both personal networks and\nusing a professional search firm, the board has to decide between three solid candidates.\nEven though all three candidates (Adam, Burt, and Charlie) could be a solid CEO, none\nof them stand out as the obvious choice. In order to get a better overall picture of the their\nstrengths and weaknesses, Todd prepared a short summary that he emailed to his fellow\nboard members:\nFellow Secursiv BOD members,\nIn order to facilitate a decision on our CEO search at tomorrow's\nboard meeting, I have prepared a short summary of each candidate\nbelow. Looking forward to seeing you again!\nTodd\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAdam Smith\nAdam knows the industry well, and has spent the last 3 years\nfocused on solving a very similar customer problem to what we are\ndoing with Startup Inc. At his current employer, IBM, he is a VP\nin charge of about 160 people and with a total P&L responsibility\nof around $65M of annual sales. Most of Adam's references have\ncome back very strong, he is considered one of the shining stars\nat IBM. However, one of his peer references mentioned that he\ncould be quite political. There are some concerns related to\nAdam's lack of start-up experience. He is also quite focused on a\nhigh base salary, and has asked some questions that lead me to\nbelieve he is not well educated on the value of equity in a\ngrowing start-up. Adam lives in Newton with his wife and two\nkids.\nBurt Nelson\nEverybody in the industry knows Burt, he is truly one of the most\ninfluential people in the network security world. Over the last\n20 years he has focused on solving the exact same problem that\nSecursiv is going after, and he truly understands the value\nproposition. In addition, since he is a frequent speaker at\nindustry events and quoted in the press we will get significant\nexposure if he joins the company. Burt has been involved in 4\nprior startups, all focused on the security industry, and he is\nquite a hard working person (as reinforced by his references). He\ndoes not have prior CEO experience, the most senior position he\nhas prior held is that of COO (for Good Company Inc, with about\n35 direct reports). Even though Burt lives with his wife (who is\n\na winery manager) in San Francisco, his entire extended family is\nhere and he is looking forward to moving back. The team\nunanimously likes and respects Burt, he has even crossed paths\nwith some of them in prior lives.\nCharlie Walker\nCharlie is a well known person to us. He was the CEO of Success\nInc and Even Greater Success Inc, both of which were investments\nof ours. However, he was also CEO of Implode Inc were the market\nwas not really developing as fast as we were hoping, and it was\ncomplete write-off. Charlie is one of the hardest working people\nin the Boston entrepreneurial society but he took the last year\noff to learn how to fly his plane (which he uses to commute to\nhis house in Florida in the wintertime). During his career\nCharlie has never worked directly in the security industry, but\nhe has all the applicable knowledge of how to build a business\nand create shareholder value. Charlie is asking for 10% equity\nand a full acceleration upon any kind of exit. He says he thinks\nwe should consider the fact that he is willing to work for an\nannual salary of $50k before complaining about his equity\nrequirements. He has a point there...\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.431 Entrepreneurial Finance\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
