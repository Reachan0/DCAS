Earth Face\nSimple heat related questions about the Earth body:\n\nIn this course - the word \"terrestrial\" specifically refers to the\nplanet Earth.\nThe word \"terrestrial\" is also currently referred to other planets\nsuch as Mars and Venus.\nSo a simple question is - What is terrestrial heat?\nA simplistic answer is -\nTerrestrial heat is the heat of the planet Earth.\nBut that is an incomplete answer for the incomplete question.\nWhat further questions can we ask about terrestrial heat?\nWhat are the fundamental questions unanswered still?\n\nWe all know that the surface of the Earth gets heated externally\nby solar radiation, meaning by Sun's rays.\nWe also know that Earth is getting heated internally, from inside.\nSo there is heat production from inside and heat flow to the\nsurface of the Earth.\nSo the next leading questions are:\nHow is that heat produced? How is it reaching the surface?\nHow much is needed? Currently sufficient?\nOtherwise will the Earth cool off?\nThus the field of Terrestrial Heat has many important\nfundamental questions - on which fundamental research has\nbeen ongoing for decades.\n\nThe earth has a temperature around 7000 degrees Celsius in inner the\ncore, on an average the temperature increases by 25-35 deg. C. per\nkilometer measured from the earth surface and inwards.\nThe temperature potential can be exploited as heat by pumping a fluid\naround in a circuit which takes the medium to depths of 2-5 kilometers.\nDepending on the depth and temperature profile, it is possible to\nachieve exit temperatures around 200 deg. C.\nKnowledge of energy sources in the Earth is of increasing interest from\nmany different points of view in the geosciences.\nWhy the heat is so high at the center of the Earth?\n\nThe Global Heat Flow Database of\nThe International Heat Flow Commission\nis maintained currently by\nProf. Will Gosnold, Univ. of North Dakota\nhttp://www.heatflow.und.edu/index.html\nSo where is the heat coming from in the center of the\nEarth?\n\nIn late 1800's, Lord Kelvin assumed that the Earth\nwas originally as hot as the Sun and has been cooling\never since. He calculated that it would take between\n20 and 400 million years for the earth to cool to its\npresent state.\nThis age estimate was not acceptable when\ncompared to other evidence. This disagreement led\nto the searches for the identification of other sources\nof heat production within the Earth.\nTo resolve this disagreement we need to know the\nsources of heat in the heat equilibrium equation.\n\nFigure. Earth continuing to\ncool over its life time by\ncurrent theory\nFor example, heat\nproduction 3 billion years\nago is twice heat production\nof present day.\nThus, less and less heat is\ngetting generated in the\nEarth through times,\nbecause of the radioactive\ndecay of the heat producing\nelements .\n\nMe\nan\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\nheat production\nrate\ns.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nRadioactivity as a heat source was quickly\nrecognized soon after its discovery in 1895.\nRadiogenic heat is the heat generated by the decay\nof radioactive isotopes of the elements.\nRadiogenic heat was investigated as the source of\nheat flux over and above the primordial heat in the\nEarth. Abundances of heat producing elements\n(HPE) in the Earth were investigated extensively\nsince then.\n\nTerrestrial heat - production\nTerrestrial heat - flow - dissipation\nTerrestrial heat - transport\nTerrestrial heat - energy usage\nEtc.\nThe focus of this course is the importance of antineutrino\nanalysis for the concentration determination of the\nHeat Producing Elements for assaying the whole Earth -\nthe knowledge of which is useful for identifying the\nradioactive sources of heat in such studies.\n\nRefer to Quantitative geophysics and geology by Lliboutry, L.,\nChapter 9.

The crust is further divided into oceanic crust and\ncontinental crust, the mantle is sub divided into the upper mantle which is\nbelow the crust, and the lower mantle is below the outer mantle going\ntoward the center of the Earth. Similarly, the core is subdivided into the\nouter core and inner core. The outer core is below the lower mantle. The\ninner core is at the very center of the Earth. The approximate radial\nthicknesses are: oceanic crust 5 to 10 km, continental crust 50 to 65 km,\nupper mantle 640 km, lower mantle 2240 km, outer core 2260 km and\ninner core 1220 km.

It effects the\noverall efficiency from the detection point of view.\n\n- Alpha rays have discrete\nenergies.\n- Gamma rays have\ndiscrete and also may have\ncontinuous energies.\n- Beta rays have continuous\nenergies.\nContinuous energy spectrum\nof the beta rays is shown in\nthe figure.\nThe maximum energy Emax\ncorresponds approximately\nto Q (slide 27)\nRef. p. 273 Subatomic Physics,\nFrauenfelder & Henley\n\n- Qβ- = ZM -\nto a first approximation\nZ+1M\nwhere\nZM and Z+1M are neutral atomic masses of parent\nand product of negatron β decay.\nT\n= measured maximum kinetic energy or\nmax\n\"end point \" energy of the continuous beta ray\nspectrum\nTγ = Total gamma ray energy emitted after beta ray.\n1 amu = 1 atomic mass unit = 931 MeV.\n- http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/qcalc/qcalcr.jsp\n\nWhy is Qβ - value important?\nWhere does it play a role?\n- Qβ - value becomes important in the detection\nmethodology.\n- The detection threshold energy is the minimum\nenergy required for the detection nuclear reaction\nto happen, in the detector medium.\n- If the reaction threshold energy > Qβ - , the\ncorresponding betas, in turn the corresponding\nantineutrinos cannot be detected when they\ninteract with the detector medium.\n\n- The isotopes of the elements K, U and Th are long-\nlived and radioactive.\n- The next Table lists, end decay products of U and Th\ndecay series, the total Q value available, the\nmaximum beta- energy and the corresponding\nvalues of 40K decay.

The fractional transmission decreases\nexponentially but finally reaches zero, with\nincreased thickness of the detection medium. That\nvalue of the thickness equals the maximum range,\ncharacteristic of those beta particles.\n\n- Gamma rays, which are neutral, interact with the detection\nmedium, predominantly by three major types of interactions\ncalled photo electric absorption, Compton scattering and pair\nproduction. Gamma rays get attenuated in the detection\nmedium.\n- Neutrons, which are neutral particles, interact with the nuclei\nof the detection medium. In this process, the neutrons either\nmay lose their energy and change the direction of their path,\nor they may disappear completely by generating one or more\nsecondary radiations.\n- In contrast to gamma rays, the resulting secondary radiations\nare mostly heavy charged particles, which can then be\ndetected directly.\n\n- Antineutrinos interact weakly with any matter. That\nis the main reason, even the antineutrinos generated\nin the deep interior of the Earth reach the surface of\nthe Earth.\n- However, antineutrinos interact weakly with the\ndetector medium as well. Hence the probability of\ntheir detection is very low relative to, for example\ngamma rays. Thus, they need very large volume\ndetection medium.\n\n-\nAlpha particles travel very short\ndistances in materials, often less than\n100 micrometers in solid low-atomic\nnumber materials.\n-\nBeta particles are more penetrating,\nmany of them able to travel a few\nmillimeters in low-atomic-number solid\nmaterials.\n-\nGamma radiation is quite penetrating\nand depending on its energy, can\npenetrate through tens of centimeters\nthickness of lead large thicknesses of\nhigh atomic number solid materials\nlike lead\n-\nNeutron path length , several meters ,in a\ndetection medium is strongly dependent on\nthe energy of the neutron,\n-\nAntineutrinos are capable of penetrating\n12,000 kilometers, the entire diameter of\nthe Earth.\n\n- Thus, the stopping power of the detection medium\ndetermines the efficiency of the detector.\n- Stopping power parameter is dependent on the\nenergy of the radiation.\n\nAssume a hypothetical detector exposed to some\ntype of radiation.\nConsider first a single particle or quantum of\nradiation that enters the detection medium. This\nsingle particle could be for example a single alpha\nparticle or gamma ray photon.\nIn order for the radiation to be detected, the\ndetector medium must respond by interacting with\nthe radiation particle which has certain amount of\nenergy.\n\n- Thus a charge Q appears within the detector\nat the time t = 0 due to interaction of a single\nparticle or quantum of radiation.\n- This charge Q must be collected to form the\nbasic electric signal, which is accomplished by\nthe imposition of an electric field within the\ndetector which causes the positive and\nnegative charges created by the radiation to\nflow in the opposite directions.\n\n- If the charge is collected for a time period tc ,\nthe time integral over the duration of the\ncurrent must be equal to Q, the total amount\nof charge generated in that specific\ninteraction.\n- Detector model schematic\n\nThe next step of operation in the detector is fundamentally of\ntwo distinct types:\n- Current mode of operation\n- Pulse mode of operation.\n- Current mode represents in which the average dc current\nproduced by the detector is measured.\n- Pulse mode - instead of looking at the average current over\nmany interactions, the output is recorded for each individual\nquantum of radiation which happens to interact with the\ndetector medium.\n\nWhen operating a radiation detector in pulse mode, each\nindividual pulse amplitude carries important information\nregarding the charge generated by that particular radiation\ninteraction in the detector.\n- The amplitudes will be different for a large number of pulses,\ndue to difference in incident radiation energy or to fluctuations\nin inherent response of the detector to the incident radiation.\n- The pulse amplitude distribution is a fundamental property of\nthe detector output which provides important information\nabout the incident radiation or the operation of the detector\nitself.\n\nIn radiation spectrometry, the main object is\nmeasurement of the energy distribution of the incident\nradiation.\n- Full Width Half Maximum FWHM\n- Pulse Height at maximum H0\n- Resolution R = FWHM / H0\n- How closely the adjacent incident energies can be\ndetected, is measured by energy resolution parameter.\n\n- Absolute Efficiency\n= number of pulses recorded/\nEabs\nnumber of radiation quanta\nemitted by source\n- Intrinsic Efficiency\n= number of pulses recorded /\nEint\nnumber of quanta incident on detector\n\nEint = Eabs Ω\n- Where Ω is the solid angle of the detector seen\nfrom the actual source position.\n- Intrinsic efficiency of the detector depends\nprimarily on the detector material, the\nradiation energy, and the physical thickness of\nthe detector in the direction of the incident\nradiation. A dependence on the distance\nbetween the source and the detector remains.\n\n54Incident radiation and solid angle.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nUsed with permission\n\nFigure. Conceptualization of solid angle between\nsource (Earth) and detector located on/in the crust\nSolid angle parameter is of significant importance in\nantineutrino analysis, with reference to the antineutrino\ndetector located on crust, because of the large dimensions of\nthe Earth regions compared to the detector size.\nUsed with permission\n\n- A detector with known efficiency can be used\nto measure the absolute activity of a\nradioactive source\n- Assumption: Source emits radiation\nisotropically and no attenuation takes place\nbetween source and detector.\n- Solid angle parameter is of significant\nimportance in antineutrino analysis.\n\nRadiation detection spectrometer for\nmeasuring the incident radiation, typically consists of:\n1) Detector (detecting (target) medium)\n2) Transducer (Photo Multiplier Tubes optional)\n3) Preamplifier and Amplifier\n4) Pulse Height Analyzer\n5) Multi Channel Analyzer\n6) Computer & peripherals\nFigure in the next slide shows pictorially the components of\na radiation detection spectrometer.\n\nUsed with permission\n\nTypes of radiation.\n- Interaction of radiation with the detection medium\nConcepts of\nstopping power of the medium\npenetration range of the incident radiation\nin the medium.\nSimplified detector model\nDeposition of energy and charge collection\nConversion of charge to signal pulse\nEnergy resolution and efficiency of the detector\nSolid angle parameter of the incident radiation\nRelevance of the solid angle parameter in the\nanalysis of Earth's K, U, Th determination\n\n-\nThe penetration power of antineutrinos is\nthousands of times higher than other radiations\nlike alpha, beta and gamma.\n-\nThe path length of the antineutrinos is greater\nthan the Earth's diameter.\n-\nHence antineutrinos generated in the deep\ninterior of the Earth reach the surface of the\nEarth, and thus can be detected.\n\n- Antineutrinos generated at the site of\ncreation are detected by means of the\neffects they produce in a detecting\nmedium.\n- Because these antineutrinos reach\nthe crust or surface of the Earth, and\ninteract with the detector medium, we\nwill be able to do the analysis.\n- This is the key point in the\ndetermination of Heat Producing\nElements (HPE) in deep interiors of\nthe Earth by the antineutrinos they\nemanate.\n- Such an analysis cannot done by\nusing alpha, beta, gamma rays\ncoming from the HPE located in the\ndeep interior of the Earth.\nUsed with permission\n\nFor detection of radiations like alpha, beta, gamma,\nneutron - the main point is that\n- Their interaction with the detecting medium is strong,\nwhere as interaction of antineutrinos is weak.\n- Their interaction probability with the detector medium\nis higher than that of a weakly interacting particle like\nthe neutrino or antineutrino.\n- Hence the detector medium has to be much higher in\nvolume and material for the antineutrino particle\ndetection.\n- The detection concepts and parameters discussed so\nfar are applicable to the antineutrino radiation\ndetection except for the penetrability of the\nantineutrinos.\n\n- In 1934, long before the neutrino was\ndetected in an experiment, Fermi provided\nmodel for the beta decay process.\n- The fundamental process that takes place\nin beta decay is the change of a neutron\ninto a proton, an electron, and an\nantineutrino. The neutron may be a free\nparticle, or it may be bound inside the\nnucleus.\n\nWhat happens when antineutrinos enter matter of the\ndetector medium?\nMost of the time, they pass straight through without\nscattering, but Fermi's theory of the weak force\npredicts that the neutrino can induce a beta decay .\nIn particular, the antineutrino (the antiparticle of the\nneutrino) will occasionally interact with a nucleus\nthrough the weak force and will induce the\ntransformation of a proton into a neutron.\n\n- Negative beta decay accompanied by antineutrinos\n- a neutron in an unstable nucleus becomes a\nproton emitting an electron and an antineutrino.\n- Inverse beta decay capturing antineutrinos by\nprotons in a detector - an incoming antineutrino\ninteracts with a proton in the detection medium\nreleasing a neutron and a positron.\n\n- This inverse of the usual beta-decay process results\nin a nucleus with one less unit of positive charge. The\nreaction products are:\n(antineutrino) + X (n, p) - e+ + Y (n+1, p-1) ,\n- where n equals the number of neutrons and p equals\nthe number of protons of a nucleus X. If the nucleus\nhappens to be that of hydrogen (a single proton),\nthen the interaction produces a neutron and a\n(antineutrino) + p - n + e+ .\nAntineutrinos are detected by detecting the inverse\nbeta decay reaction products namely, positron and\nthe neutron.\npositron, e+:\n\n- Antineutrinos travel in\nstraight lines from point\nA to B; unlike for\nexample the neutrons\nwhich travel zig-zag.\n- This characteristic of the\nantineutrinos is useful\nin the antineutrino\nanalysis to develop\ndetection directional\nsensitivity. Double signature of inverse beta decay.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nThe figure illustrates\nantineutrino detection\nprinciples.\nInverse beta decay reaction\nbegins when the incident\nantineutrino (blue dashed\nline) interacts with protons\nin the medium.\nThe reaction products\npositron (e+ ) and a\nneutron (n) are released. Double signature of inverse beta decay.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n- Presence of antineutrino is confirmed by detecting\nboth products of inverse beta decay, a reaction in\nwhich an incident antineutrino (blue dashed line)\ninteracts with a proton through the weak force. The\nantineutrino turns into a positron (e+), and the\nproton turns into a neutron (n).\n- In the figure, this reaction is shown to take place in\na liquid scintillator. The short solid blue arrow\nindicates that, shortly after it has been created, the\npositron encounters an electron, and the particle\nand antiparticle annihilate each other.\n\n- Two gamma rays are emitted that travel in opposite\ndirections and will cause the liquid scintillator to\nproduce a flash of visible light.\n- In the meantime, the neutron travels further,\nfollowing a random path (longer zig-zag, solid blue\narrow) until it is captured. The resulting nucleus\nreleases energy in gamma rays that will cause the\nliquid scintillator to produce again a tiny flash of\nvisible light.\n- This sequence of two flashes of light separated by a\nfew microseconds is the double signature of inverse\nbeta decay and confirms the presence of an\nantineutrino.\n\nFirst and second flashes separated by few microseconds when\ndetected in coincidence provide the \"double signature\"of inverse\nbeta decay to confirm the detection of the incident antineutrino.\n74Double signature of inverse beta decay.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nInverse beta decay\nby a proton\nin a detector by capturing\nantineutrinos - an incoming\nantineutrino interacts with a\nproton in the detection\nmedium releasing a neutron\nand a positron.\nThreshold energy of the\nreaction - 1. 8 MeV\nInverse beta decay\nby a deuteron, d:\nThreshold energy of the\nreaction - 4.03 MeV.\n\nFigure. Relevance of detection threshold energy to the detection of energies\nof antineutrinos emitted in the decay of K, U, and Th in the Earth.\n1) The vertical dotted line at 1.8 MeV represents the energy threshold of scintillation\ndetectors employing the inverse beta decay reaction for the detection of\nantineutrinos. So K cannot be detected if the detection threshold is higher.\nRef. Araki et al. KamLAND Collaboration, Nature, 2005, 436, 499-503.\n2) The red dash and dotted line at 4.03 MeV represents the energy threshold for\ndetectors using deuterium for the inverse beta decay reaction. Hence K, U, Th\ncannot be detected with such detectors.\n\nRef. Figure based on the figure of KamLand detector by KamLAND collaboration\n\nOne of the ways of detection is by\na liquid scintillator.\nA liquid scintillator converts a\nfraction of the energy of the\ngamma rays, generated by the\nincident positron annihilation, into\na tiny flash of light. Similarly\nscintillation light pulses are\ngenerated by the energy of the\ngamma rays emitted by the\ninteraction of the neutrons with\nthe scintillation medium.\nThe light travels through the highly\ntransparent liquid scintillator to\nthe surrounding photo multiplier\ntubes, where the photons are\nconverted into an electronic pulse.\nRef. Figure based on the figure of KamLand detector by\nKamLAND collaboration\n\nConcept of Interference:\nThe incident energy of the radiation is converted into a\nsignal pulse by the detection system.\nSo each pulse is representative of the incident energy.\nThat incident energy of the radiation corresponds to the\nisotope of the element of interest.\nHowever, that pulse may also be generated by an\nenergy of radiation not belonging to the isotope of\ninterest. This additional contribution is thus\ninterfering with the true pulse of interest.\n\nThere are primarily four component sources in the\nbackground spectrum, interfering with the signal of interest:\n1. The intrinsic Heat Producing Elements (HPE) contamination in\nthe component materials used in the construction of the\ndetector.\n2. The cosmic ray interactions which produce signals\nsimilar to the signal of interest.\n3. Power reactors and other anthropogenic sources\nsurrounding the detector.\n4. Interference from fluctuating airborne radioactivity.\nThese background contributions should be properly accounted in\norder to optimize the detection signal to background ratio not\nonly to improve the detection sensitivity but also to measure\nthe HPE (namely K, U, Th) abundances accurately.\n\n- Antineutrinos are detected by inverse beta decay\nreaction with the detection matter.\n- Inverse beta decay capturing antineutrinos by\nprotons of detector matter - an incoming\nantineutrino interacts with a proton in the\ndetection medium releasing a neutron and a\npositron.\n\n- Incident antineutrino interacts with the protons of the\ndetecting medium by inverse beta decay reaction.\n- The reaction products are positron and neutron.\n- These in turn generate gamma rays.\n- These gamma rays are detected by the scintillating\nmedium, which generate the light pulses; which are\ndetected by the photo multiplier tubes which provide\nthe signal for analysis.\n\n- The final signal of the gamma rays from positron and the\nneutrons that are detected in coincidence provide\nconfirmation of the incident antineutrino.\n- This type of detection methodology does not sustain the\ninformation of the direction of the incident antineutrino. That\ninformation is lost partially, if not in full.\n- Many investigators consider that , since in the inverse beta\ndecay reaction, the neutron emitted most of the time is in\nthe forward path of the incident antineutrino direction,\ndirectional information of the incident antineutrino is\npreserved partially if not in full.\n\nCurrently, the preferred mode\nof antineutrino detection is by\ndetection of scintillation\npulses emitted by interaction\nof gamma-rays with the\nscintillator; the gamma rays\nare generated by the inverse\nbeta decay reaction products\nneutron (n) and positron (e+ ). Detection.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n- The positron travels at relativistic velocity in the detection medium and\nannihilation takes place only when it eventually comes to rest and\ninteracts with an electron, emitting two equal and opposite gamma-rays,\neach of energy 511 keV.\n- These gamma rays will interact with the scintillating medium of the\ndetector, scinitillation light photons will be generated. The photo\nmultiplier tube converts the incident scintillation photon into a signal.\n- The neutron travels in zig-zag path, in the detection medium, until it is\ncaptured. The resulting nucleus releases energy in gamma rays that will\ncause the liquid scintillator to generate scinitllation light.\n- Thus in the scintillation detection method, consists of detecting the\ngamma rays from the reaction products namely the positron and neutron.\n- The information of the direction of the incident antineutrino is lost\nbecause scintillation light resulting from the gamma rays, will be emitted\nisotropically and not preferentially.\n\n- Incident antineutrino interacts with\nthe proton of the detection medium by\ninverse beta decay reaction, emitting\nneutron and positron.\n- The positron, travelling almost at\nrelativistic velocity of the light, emits\nCerenkov radiation.\n- In contrast to the scintillation light\nwhich is emitted isotropically,\nCerenkov radiation is emitted\npreferentially along the direction of\nthe positron velocity, in the shape of\na cone with the vertex pointing\ntowards the direction of the incident\nantineutrino.\nUsed with permission.\n\n- Direction of the incident\nantineutrino will be\ninferred by specially\ndesigned software which\ndeduces that information\nby identification of the\nlocations of the photo\nmultiplier tubes which\nprovide a correlated\nsignal for the emitted\nCerenkov radiation.\nUsed with permission.\n\nAntineutrino detection\nAntineutrino detection\nwith no directional\nwith no directional\nsensitivity\nsensitivity\nAntineutrino detection with\nAntineutrino detection with\ndirectional sensitivity\ndirectional sensitivity\nUsed with permission.\n\n- Detection method is by\nscintillation detection.\n- Gamma rays that produce\nthe scintillation for\ndetection, are generated\nfrom the reaction products\nnamely neutron and\npositron.\n- Detection time is in micro\nseconds.\n- Detection method is by\nCerenkov radiation\ndetection.\n- The reaction product,\nnamely, positron itself emits\nCerenkov radiation in a\ncharacteristic cone shape\nwith a vertex in the direction\nof the incident antineutrino.\n- Detection time is in pico\nseconds.\n\nThis session provided\n□ Basics of radiation characteristics of\nheat producing elements (HPE):\n-\nAlpha, beta, gamma, neutrino and\nantineutrino radiations\n□ Alpha, positive beta decay and negative\nbeta decay, neutrino and antineutrino\nemission in K, U, Th decay.\n□ Long-lived radiogenic Isotopes of the\nheat producing elements of K, U and Th,\ntheir half-lives, isotopic abundances\n□ U and Th decay series\n□ 40K decay scheme.\n\nBasics of Radiation Detection\nConcepts:\n1.\nInteraction of radiation with the\ndetection medium\n2.\nDetection signal: Charge\ncollection\n3.\nDetection signal: Charge\ncollection\nto pulse formation\n4.\nEnergy resolution\n5.\nDetection efficiency and solid\nangle\n\nBasics of Antineutrino Radiation Detection\nConcepts:\n1.
