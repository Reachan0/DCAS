However, it is often difficult to pinpoint the\nlocus (pre- vs. post-synaptic) of these modifications in the CNS. This complication arises from\nthe fact that it may be possible to change several different parameters for either the pre- or\npost-synaptic terminal, and induce the same overall effect of increased/decreased strength at\nany given synapse. For both the pre- and post-synaptic side:\n1) List all of the parameters that could undergo modifications.\n2) For each of these possibilities, outline an experimental approach that could\npotentially determine if that particular parameter indeed plays a role in\nmodifying the strength of synaptic connections. Clearly state any underlying\nassumptions you may need to make for a given experimental approach.\nhttp://tonegawa23.mit.edu/quizzes/798quiz1.htm\n3/11/2003"
