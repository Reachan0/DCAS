How to find legal materials\nMIT has a networkwide subscription to a limited version of the LexisNexis database, known as LexisNexis\nAcademic. It contains a large library of news materials, Lexis's commercial annotated edition of the United States\nCode and the Constitution, similar state materials, Congressional bills and federal statutes starting from 1989, the\nCongressional Record, the Federal Register, the Code of Federal Regulations, and virtually every published decision\nof a federal or state court that you could find in a law library.\nTo begin, go to http://web.lexisnexis.com/universe and click \"Legal Research.\"\n- To get a decision by name: \"Get a Case,\" then enter the names of the parties.\n- To get a decision by citation: \"Get a Case,\" then enter the citation.\n- To get a section of the United States Code: \"Federal Code,\" then \"Guided Search,\" and search by \"Cite\" as\nfollows: to get 47 U.S.C. § 230, enter \"47 USCS sec 230\".\n- To get a public law: \"Congressional,\" then \"Laws,\" then \"Laws by Number.\"\n- To get a Congressional bill: \"Congressional,\" then \"Bills,\" then \"Bills by Number.\"\nMost of the search forms also let you search by contents as well as citation, and there are lots of materials available\nin addition to the above. Don't be afraid to explore!\n4. Structure of the federal court system\nCivil and criminal cases start at a federal district court in front of a single trial judge appointed for life\nby the president. All of Massachusetts is in one district, the District of Massachusetts (D. Mass). There are\ncourthouses in Boston, Worcester, and Springfield that house the United States District Court for the District\nof Massachusetts.\nThe losing party can usually appeal a \"final judgment or order\" to a threejudge panel of a federal appeals\ncourt. The federal court system is organized geographically into 12 \"circuits,\" each with a court of appeals. Cases\nfrom our district court are appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. There are\nalso some specialized appeals courts, like the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears all patentrelated appeals.\nThere are six \"active\" judges on the First Circuit Court of Appeals (the smallest in the country), but only three\nrandomlyselected judges on a panel. If a majority of active judges on the court vote to allow it, a case can be reheard\nby a federal appeals court sitting en banc, usually the entire court. This happens rarely.\nFinally, a losing party in a federal appeals court or a state supreme court can file a \"petition for certiorari\" with\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in Washington, D.C. Unlike a direct appeal, the Supreme Court is not\nrequired to hear your case and in fact only grants \"cert\" for about one percent of requests.\nFederal courts have jurisdiction to hear cases involving federal laws, like copyright (Recording Indus. Ass'n of\nAm., supra) and deprivation of civil rights (Reno v. ACLU, supra). They also have jurisdiction to hear some cases\narising under state laws, when the value of the dispute is more than $75,000 and the parties are in different states:\na \"diversity\" case (Zeran, supra). States' own court systems hear the rest of the cases. Most states have systems\nsimilar in structure to the federal government."

      "content": "OCTOBER TERM, 1993\nSyllabus\nCAMPBELL, aka SKYYWALKER, et al. v. ACUFF\nROSE MUSIC, INC.\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe sixth circuit\nNo. 92-1292.\nArgued November 9, 1993--Decided March 7, 1994\nRespondent Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., filed suit against petitioners, the mem\nbers of the rap music group 2 Live Crew and their record company,\nclaiming that 2 Live Crew's song, \"Pretty Woman,\" infringed Acuff-\nRose's copyright in Roy Orbison's rock ballad, \"Oh, Pretty Woman.\"\nThe District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live Crew, holding\nthat its song was a parody that made fair use of the original song.\nSee\nCopyright Act of 1976, 17 U. S. C. §107.\nThe Court of Appeals reversed\nand remanded, holding that the commercial nature of the parody ren\ndered it presumptively unfair under the first of four factors relevant\nunder §107; that, by taking the \"heart\" of the original and making it\nthe \"heart\" of a new work, 2 Live Crew had, qualitatively, taken too\nmuch under the third §107 factor; and that market harm for purposes\nof the fourth §107 factor had been established by a presumption attach\ning to commercial uses.\nHeld: 2 Live Crew's commercial parody may be a fair use within the\nmeaning of §107.\nPp. 574-594.\n(a) Section 107, which provides that \"the fair use of a copyrighted\nwork . . . for purposes such as criticism [or] comment . . . is not an\ninfringement . . . ,\" continues the common-law tradition of fair use adju\ndication and requires case-by-case analysis rather than bright-line rules.\nThe statutory examples of permissible uses provide only general guid\nance.\nThe four statutory factors are to be explored and weighed to\ngether in light of copyright's purpose of promoting science and the\narts.\nPp. 574-578.\n(b) Parody, like other comment and criticism, may claim fair use.\nUnder the first of the four §107 factors, \"the purpose and character of\nthe use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature . . . ,\" the\nenquiry focuses on whether the new work merely supersedes the objects\nof the original creation, or whether and to what extent it is \"transforma\ntive,\" altering the original with new expression, meaning, or message.\nThe more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance\nof other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding\nof fair use.\nThe heart of any parodist's claim to quote from existing\nmaterial is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nSyllabus\ncreate a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's work.\nBut that tells courts little about where to draw the line.\nThus, like\nother uses, parody has to work its way through the relevant factors.\nPp. 578-581.\n(c) The Court of Appeals properly assumed that 2 Live Crew's song\ncontains parody commenting on and criticizing the original work, but\nerred in giving virtually dispositive weight to the commercial nature of\nthat parody by way of a presumption, ostensibly culled from Sony Corp.\nof America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 451, that\n\"every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively . . .\nunfair . . . .\"\nThe statute makes clear that a work's commercial nature\nis only one element of the first factor enquiry into its purpose and char\nacter, and Sony itself called for no hard evidentiary presumption.\nThe\nCourt of Appeals's rule runs counter to Sony and to the long common-\nlaw tradition of fair use adjudication.\nPp. 581-585.\n(d) The second §107 factor, \"the nature of the copyrighted work,\" is\nnot much help in resolving this and other parody cases, since parodies\nalmost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works, like the Orbi\nson song here.\nP. 586.\n(e) The Court of Appeals erred in holding that, as a matter of law, 2\nLive Crew copied excessively from the Orbison original under the third\n§107 factor, which asks whether \"the amount and substantiality of the\nportion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole\" are reason\nable in relation to the copying's purpose.\nEven if 2 Live Crew's copy\ning of the original's first line of lyrics and characteristic opening bass\nriff may be said to go to the original's \"heart,\" that heart is what most\nreadily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which\nparody takes aim.\nMoreover, 2 Live Crew thereafter departed mark\nedly from the Orbison lyrics and produced otherwise distinctive music.\nAs to the lyrics, the copying was not excessive in relation to the song 's\nparodic purpose.\nAs to the music, this Court expresses no opinion\nwhether repetition of the bass riff is excessive copying, but remands to\npermit evaluation of the amount taken, in light of the song 's parodic\npurpose and character, its transformative elements, and considerations\nof the potential for market substitution.\nPp. 586-589.\n(f) The Court of Appeals erred in resolving the fourth §107 factor,\n\"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the\ncopyrighted work,\" by presuming, in reliance on Sony, supra, at 451,\nthe likelihood of significant market harm based on 2 Live Crew's use for\ncommercial gain.\nNo \"presumption\" or inference of market harm that\nmight find support in Sony is applicable to a case involving something\nbeyond mere duplication for commercial purposes.\nThe cognizable\nharm is market substitution, not any harm from criticism.\nAs to parody\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\npure and simple, it is unlikely that the work will act as a substitute for\nthe original, since the two works usually serve different market func\ntions.\nThe fourth factor requires courts also to consider the potential\nmarket for derivative works.\nSee, e. g., Harper & Row, Publishers,\nInc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539, 568.\nIf the later work has\ncognizable substitution effects in protectible markets for derivative\nworks, the law will look beyond the criticism to the work's other ele\nments.\n2 Live Crew's song comprises not only parody but also rap\nmusic.\nThe absence of evidence or affidavits addressing the effect of 2\nLive Crew's song on the derivative market for a nonparody, rap version\nof \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" disentitled 2 Live Crew, as the proponent of the\naffirmative defense of fair use, to summary judgment.\nPp. 590-594.\n972 F. 2d 1429, reversed and remanded.\nSouter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nKennedy, J.,\nfiled a concurring opinion, post, p. 596.\nBruce S. Rogow argued the cause for petitioners.\nWith\nhim on the briefs was Alan Mark Turk.\nSidney S. Rosdeitcher argued the cause for respondent.\nWith him on the brief were Peter L. Felcher and Stuart M.\nCobert.*\nJustice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.\nWe are called upon to decide whether 2 Live Crew's com\nmercial parody of Roy Orbison's song, \"Oh, Pretty Woman,\"\n*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the American\nCivil Liberties Union by Steven F. Reich, Steven R. Shapiro, Marjorie\nHeins, and John A. Powell; for Capitol Steps Production, Inc., et al. by\nWilliam C. Lane; for the Harvard Lampoon, Inc., by Robert H. Loeffler\nand Jonathan Band; for the PEN American Center by Leon Friedman;\nand for Robert C. Berry et al. by Alfred C. Yen.\nBriefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the National\nMusic Publishers' Association, Inc., et al. by Marvin E. Frankel and Mi\nchael S. Oberman; and for Fred Ebb et al. by Stephen Rackow Kaye,\nCharles S. Sims, and Jon A. Baumgarten.\nBriefs of amici curiae were filed for Home Box Office et al. by Daniel\nM. Waggoner, P. Cameron DeVore, George Vradenburg, Bonnie Bogin, and\nRichard Cotton; and for Warner Bros. by Cary H. Sherman and Robert\nAlan Garrett.\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nmay be a fair use within the meaning of the Copyright Act\nof 1976, 17 U. S. C. §107 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV).\nAlthough\nthe District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live\nCrew, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding the defense\nof fair use barred by the song's commercial character and\nexcessive borrowing.\nBecause we hold that a parody's com\nmercial character is only one element to be weighed in a fair\nuse enquiry, and that insufficient consideration was given to\nthe nature of parody in weighing the degree of copying, we\nreverse and remand.\nI\nIn 1964, Roy Orbison and William Dees wrote a rock ballad\ncalled \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" and assigned their rights in it to\nrespondent Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\nSee Appendix A, infra,\nat\n594.\nAcuff-Rose\nregistered\nthe\nsong\nfor\ncopyright\nprotection.\nPetitioners Luther R. Campbell, Christopher Wongwon,\nMark Ross, and David Hobbs are collectively known as 2\nLive Crew, a popular rap music group.1\nIn 1989, Campbell\nwrote a song entitled \"Pretty Woman,\" which he later de\nscribed in an affidavit as intended, \"through comical lyrics,\nto satirize the original work . . . .\"\nApp. to Pet. for Cert.\n80a.\nOn July 5, 1989, 2 Live Crew's manager informed\nAcuff-Rose that 2 Live Crew had written a parody of \"Oh,\nPretty Woman,\" that they would afford all credit for owner\nship and authorship of the original song to Acuff-Rose, Dees,\nand Orbison, and that they were willing to pay a fee for the\nuse they wished to make of it.\nEnclosed with the letter\nwere a copy of the lyrics and a recording of 2 Live Crew's\nsong.\nSee Appendix B, infra, at 595.\nAcuff-Rose's agent\nrefused permission, stating that \"I am aware of the success\n1 Rap has been defined as a \"style of black American popular music con\nsisting of improvised rhymes performed to a rhythmic accompaniment.\"\nThe Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopedia of Music 613 (1988).\n2 Live\nCrew plays \"[b]ass music,\" a regional, hip-hop style of rap from the Lib\nerty City area of Miami, Florida.\nBrief for Petitioners 34.\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\nenjoyed by 'The 2 Live Crews', but I must inform you that\nwe cannot permit the use of a parody of 'Oh, Pretty\nWoman.' \"\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 85a.\nNonetheless, in June\nor July 1989,2 2 Live Crew released records, cassette tapes,\nand compact discs of \"Pretty Woman\" in a collection of songs\nentitled \"As Clean As They Wanna Be.\"\nThe albums and\ncompact discs identify the authors of \"Pretty Woman\" as\nOrbison and Dees and its publisher as Acuff-Rose.\nAlmost a year later, after nearly a quarter of a million\ncopies of the recording had been sold, Acuff-Rose sued 2 Live\nCrew and its record company, Luke Skyywalker Records, for\ncopyright infringement.\nThe District Court granted sum\nmary judgment for 2 Live Crew,3 reasoning that the commer\ncial purpose of 2 Live Crew's song was no bar to fair use;\nthat 2 Live Crew's version was a parody, which \"quickly de\ngenerates into a play on words, substituting predictable lyr\nics with shocking ones\" to show \"how bland and banal the\nOrbison song\" is; that 2 Live Crew had taken no more than\nwas necessary to \"conjure up\" the original in order to parody\nit; and that it was \"extremely unlikely that 2 Live Crew's\nsong could adversely affect the market for the original.\"\n754 F. Supp. 1150, 1154-1155, 1157-1158 (MD Tenn. 1991).\nThe District Court weighed these factors and held that 2\nLive Crew's song made fair use of Orbison's original.\nId.,\nat 1158-1159.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and\nremanded.\n972 F. 2d 1429, 1439 (1992).\nAlthough it as\nsumed for the purpose of its opinion that 2 Live Crew's song\n2 The parties argue about the timing.\n2 Live Crew contends that the\nalbum was released on July 15, and the District Court so held.\nF. Supp. 1150, 1152 (MD Tenn. 1991).\nThe Court of Appeals states that\nCampbell's affidavit puts the release date in June, and chooses that date.\n972 F. 2d 1429, 1432 (CA6 1992).\nWe find the timing of the request irrele\nvant for purposes of this enquiry.\nSee n. 18, infra, discussing good faith.\n3 2 Live Crew's motion to dismiss was converted to a motion for sum\nmary judgment.\nAcuff-Rose defended against the motion, but filed no\ncross-motion.\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nwas a parody of the Orbison original, the Court of Appeals\nthought the District Court had put too little emphasis on the\nfact that \"every commercial use . . . is presumptively . . .\nunfair,\" Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios,\nInc., 464 U. S. 417, 451 (1984), and it held that \"the admit\ntedly commercial nature\" of the parody \"requires the conclu\nsion\" that the first of four factors relevant under the statute\nweighs against a finding of fair use.\n972 F. 2d, at 1435, 1437.\nNext, the Court of Appeals determined that, by \"taking the\nheart of the original and making it the heart of a new work,\"\n2 Live Crew had, qualitatively, taken too much.\nId., at 1438.\nFinally, after noting that the effect on the potential market\nfor the original (and the market for derivative works) is \"un\ndoubtedly the single most important element of fair use,\"\nHarper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471\nU. S. 539, 566 (1985), the Court of Appeals faulted the Dis\ntrict Court for \"refus[ing] to indulge the presumption\" that\n\"harm for purposes of the fair use analysis has been estab\nlished by the presumption attaching to commercial uses.\"\n972 F. 2d, at 1438-1439.\nIn sum, the court concluded that\nits \"blatantly commercial purpose . . . prevents this parody\nfrom being a fair use.\"\nId., at 1439.\nWe granted certiorari, 507 U. S. 1003 (1993), to determine\nwhether 2 Live Crew's commercial parody could be a fair use.\nII\nIt is uncontested here that 2 Live Crew's song would be an\ninfringement of Acuff-Rose's rights in \"Oh, Pretty Woman,\"\nunder the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U. S. C. §106 (1988 ed.\nand Supp. IV), but for a finding of fair use through parody.4\n4 Section 106 provides in part:\n\"Subject to sections 107 through 120, the owner of copyright under this\ntitle has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:\n\"(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;\n\"(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\nFrom the infancy of copyright protection, some opportunity\nfor fair use of copyrighted materials has been thought neces\nsary to fulfill copyright's very purpose, \"[t]o promote the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts . . . .\"\nU. S. Const., Art.\nI, §8, cl. 8.5\nFor as Justice Story explained, \"[i]n truth, in\nliterature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if\nany, things, which in an abstract sense, are strictly new and\noriginal throughout.\nEvery book in literature, science and\nart, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much\nwhich was well known and used before.\"\nEmerson v. Da\nvies, 8 F. Cas. 615, 619 (No. 4,436) (CCD Mass. 1845).\nSimi\nlarly, Lord Ellenborough expressed the inherent tension in\nthe need simultaneously to protect copyrighted material and\nto allow others to build upon it when he wrote, \"while I shall\nthink myself bound to secure every man in the enjoyment\nof his copy-right, one must not put manacles upon science.\"\n\"(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to\nthe public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or\nlending . . . .\"\nA derivative work is defined as one \"based upon one or more preexisting\nworks, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fiction\nalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,\nabridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be re\ncast, transformed, or adapted.\nA work consisting of editorial revisions,\nannotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, repre\nsent an original work of authorship, is a 'derivative work.' \"\n17 U. S. C.\n§101.\n2 Live Crew concedes that it is not entitled to a compulsory license\nunder §115 because its arrangement changes \"the basic melody or funda\nmental character\" of the original.\n§115(a)(2).\n5 The exclusion of facts and ideas from copyright protection serves that\ngoal as well.\nSee §102(b) (\"In no case does copyright protection for an\noriginal work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system,\nmethod of operation, concept, principle, or discovery . . .\"); Feist Publi\ncations, Inc. v.

S. 539, 547 (1985)\n(copyright owner's rights exclude facts and ideas, and fair use).\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nCarey v. Kearsley, 4 Esp. 168, 170, 170 Eng. Rep. 679, 681\n(K. B. 1803).\nIn copyright cases brought under the Statute\nof Anne of 1710,6 English courts held that in some instances\n\"fair abridgements\" would not infringe an author's rights,\nsee W. Patry, The Fair Use Privilege in Copyright Law 6-17\n(1985) (hereinafter Patry); Leval, Toward a Fair Use Stand\nard, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1105 (1990) (hereinafter Leval), and\nalthough the First Congress enacted our initial copyright\nstatute, Act of May 31, 1790, 1 Stat. 124, without any explicit\nreference to \"fair use,\" as it later came to be known,7 the\ndoctrine was recognized by the American courts nonetheless.\nIn Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342 (No. 4,901) (CCD Mass.\n1841), Justice Story distilled the essence of law and method\nology from the earlier cases: \"look to the nature and objects\nof the selections made, the quantity and value of the materi\nals used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the\nsale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the\noriginal work.\"\nId., at 348.\nThus expressed, fair use re\nmained exclusively judge-made doctrine until the passage of\nthe 1976 Copyright Act, in which Justice Story's summary\nis discernible: 8\n\"§107.\nLimitations on exclusive rights: Fair use\n\"Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and\n106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such\nuse by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any\nother means specified by that section, for purposes such\nas criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (includ\ning multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or\nresearch, is not an infringement of copyright.\nIn deter\nmining whether the use made of a work in any particular\n6 An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, 8 Anne, ch. 19.\n7 Patry 27, citing Lawrence v.

S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\ncase is a fair use the factors to be considered shall\ninclude--\n\"(1) the purpose and character of the use, including\nwhether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non\nprofit educational purposes;\n\"(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\"(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in\nrelation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n\"(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for\nor value of the copyrighted work.\n\"The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar\na finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consid\neration of all the above factors.\"\n17 U. S. C. §107 (1988\ned. and Supp. IV).\nCongress meant §107 \"to restate the present judicial doc\ntrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any\nway\" and intended that courts continue the common-law tra\ndition of fair use adjudication.\nH. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 66\n(1976) (hereinafter House Report); S. Rep. No. 94-473, p. 62\n(1975) (hereinafter Senate Report).\nThe fair use doctrine\nthus \"permits [and requires] courts to avoid rigid application\nof the copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle\nthe very creativity which that law is designed to foster.\"\nStewart v. Abend, 495 U. S. 207, 236 (1990) (internal quota\ntion marks and citation omitted).\nThe task is not to be simplified with bright-line rules, for\nthe statute, like the doctrine it recognizes, calls for case-by\ncase analysis.\nHarper & Row, 471 U.

ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nCongress most commonly had found to be fair uses.9\nNor\nmay the four statutory factors be treated in isolation, one\nfrom another.\nAll are to be explored, and the results\nweighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.\nSee Leval 1110-1111; Patry & Perlmutter, Fair Use Mis\nconstrued: Profit, Presumptions, and Parody, 11 Cardozo\nArts & Ent. L. J. 667, 685-687 (1993) (hereinafter Patry &\nPerlmutter).10\nA\nThe first factor in a fair use enquiry is \"the purpose and\ncharacter of the use, including whether such use is of a com\nmercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\"\n§107(1).\nThis factor draws on Justice Story's formulation,\n\"the nature and objects of the selections made.\"\nFolsom v.\nMarsh, supra, at 348.\nThe enquiry here may be guided by\nthe examples given in the preamble to §107, looking to\nwhether the use is for criticism, or comment, or news report\n9 See Senate Report, p. 62 (\"[W]hether a use referred to in the first\nsentence of section 107 is a fair use in a particular case will depend upon\nthe application of the determinative factors\").\n10 Because the fair use enquiry often requires close questions of judg\nment as to the extent of permissible borrowing in cases involving parodies\n(or other critical works), courts may also wish to bear in mind that the\ngoals of the copyright law, \"to stimulate the creation and publication of\nedifying matter,\" Leval 1134, are not always best served by automatically\ngranting injunctive relief when parodists are found to have gone beyond\nthe bounds of fair use.\nSee 17 U. S. C. §502(a) (court \"may . . . grant . . .\ninjunctions on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain\ninfringement\") (emphasis added); Leval 1132 (while in the \"vast majority\nof cases, [an injunctive] remedy is justified because most infringements are\nsimple piracy,\" such cases are \"worlds apart from many of those raising\nreasonable contentions of fair use\" where \"there may be a strong public\ninterest in the publication of the secondary work [and] the copyright own\ner's interest may be adequately protected by an award of damages for\nwhatever infringement is found\"); Abend v. MCA, Inc., 863 F. 2d 1465,\n1479 (CA9 1988) (finding \"special circumstances\" that would cause \"great\ninjustice\" to defendants and \"public injury\" were injunction to issue), aff'd\nsub nom.

S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\ning, and the like, see §107.\nThe central purpose of this in\nvestigation is to see, in Justice Story's words, whether the\nnew work merely \"supersede[s] the objects\" of the original\ncreation, Folsom v. Marsh, supra, at 348; accord, Harper &\nRow, supra, at 562 (\"supplanting\" the original), or instead\nadds something new, with a further purpose or different\ncharacter, altering the first with new expression, meaning,\nor message; it asks, in other words, whether and to what\nextent the new work is \"transformative.\"\nLeval 1111.\nAl\nthough such transformative use is not absolutely necessary\nfor a finding of fair use, Sony, supra, at 455, n. 40,11 the goal\nof copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally\nfurthered by the creation of transformative works.\nSuch\nworks thus lie at the heart of the fair use doctrine's guaran\ntee of breathing space within the confines of copyright, see,\ne. g., Sony, supra, at 478-480 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), and\nthe more transformative the new work, the less will be the\nsignificance of other factors, like commercialism, that may\nweigh against a finding of fair use.\nThis Court has only once before even considered whether\nparody may be fair use, and that time issued no opinion be\ncause of the Court's equal division.\nBenny v. Loew's Inc.,\n239 F. 2d 532 (CA9 1956), aff 'd sub nom. Columbia Broad\ncasting System, Inc. v. Loew's Inc., 356 U. S. 43 (1958).\nSuf\nfice it to say now that parody has an obvious claim to trans\nformative value, as Acuff-Rose itself does not deny.\nLike\nless ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can provide\nsocial benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in\nthe process, creating a new one.\nWe thus line up with the\ncourts that have held that parody, like other comment or crit\nicism, may claim fair use under §107.\nSee, e. g., Fisher v.\nDees, 794 F. 2d 432 (CA9 1986) (\"When Sonny Sniffs Glue,\"\na parody of \"When Sunny Gets Blue,\" is fair use); Elsmere\nMusic, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F. Supp. 741\n11 The obvious statutory exception to this focus on transformative uses\nis the straight reproduction of multiple copies for classroom distribution.\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\n(SDNY), aff'd, 623 F. 2d 252 (CA2 1980) (\"I Love Sodom,\" a\n\"Saturday Night Live\" television parody of \"I Love New\nYork,\" is fair use); see also House Report, p. 65; Senate Re\nport, p. 61 (\"[U]se in a parody of some of the content of the\nwork parodied\" may be fair use).\nThe germ of parody lies in the definition of the Greek paro\ndeia, quoted in Judge Nelson's Court of Appeals dissent, as\n\"a song sung alongside another.\"\n972 F. 2d, at 1440, quoting\n7 Encyclopedia Britannica 768 (15th ed. 1975).\nModern dic\ntionaries accordingly describe a parody as a \"literary or ar\ntistic work that imitates the characteristic style of an author\nor a work for comic effect or ridicule,\" 12 or as a \"composition\nin prose or verse in which the characteristic turns of thought\nand phrase in an author or class of authors are imitated in\nsuch a way as to make them appear ridiculous.\" 13\nFor the\npurposes of copyright law, the nub of the definitions, and the\nheart of any parodist's claim to quote from existing material,\nis the use of some elements of a prior author's composition\nto create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that\nauthor's works.\nSee, e. g., Fisher v. Dees, supra, at 437;\nMCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F. 2d 180, 185 (CA2 1981).\nIf, on\nthe contrary, the commentary has no critical bearing on the\nsubstance or style of the original composition, which the al\nleged infringer merely uses to get attention or to avoid the\ndrudgery in working up something fresh, the claim to fair\nness in borrowing from another's work diminishes accord\ningly (if it does not vanish), and other factors, like the extent\nof its commerciality, loom larger.14\nParody needs to mimic\n12 American Heritage Dictionary 1317 (3d ed. 1992).\n13 11 Oxford English Dictionary 247 (2d ed. 1989).\n14 A parody that more loosely targets an original than the parody pre\nsented here may still be sufficiently aimed at an original work to come\nwithin our analysis of parody.\nIf a parody whose wide dissemination in\nthe market runs the risk of serving as a substitute for the original or\nlicensed derivatives (see infra, at 590-594, discussing factor four), it is\nmore incumbent on one claiming fair use to establish the extent of trans\nformation and the parody's critical relationship to the original.\nBy con\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\nan original to make its point, and so has some claim to use\nthe creation of its victim's (or collective victims') imagina\ntion, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so\nrequires justification for the very act of borrowing.15\nSee\nibid.; Bisceglia, Parody and Copyright Protection: Turning\nthe Balancing Act Into a Juggling Act, in ASCAP, Copyright\nLaw Symposium, No. 34, p. 25 (1987).\nThe fact that parody can claim legitimacy for some appro\npriation does not, of course, tell either parodist or judge\nmuch about where to draw the line.\nLike a book review\nquoting the copyrighted material criticized, parody may or\nmay not be fair use, and petitioners' suggestion that any pa\nrodic use is presumptively fair has no more justification in\nlaw or fact than the equally hopeful claim that any use for\nnews reporting should be presumed fair, see Harper & Row,\n471 U. S., at 561.\nThe Act has no hint of an evidentiary pref\nerence for parodists over their victims, and no workable pre\nsumption for parody could take account of the fact that par\nody often shades into satire when society is lampooned\nthrough its creative artifacts, or that a work may contain\nboth parodic and nonparodic elements.\nAccordingly, parody,\nlike any other use, has to work its way through the relevant\nfactors, and be judged case by case, in light of the ends of\nthe copyright law.\nHere, the District Court held, and the Court of Appeals\nassumed, that 2 Live Crew's \"Pretty Woman\" contains par\ntrast, when there is little or no risk of market substitution, whether be\ncause of the large extent of transformation of the earlier work, the new\nwork's minimal distribution in the market, the small extent to which it\nborrows from an original, or other factors, taking parodic aim at an origi\nnal is a less critical factor in the analysis, and looser forms of parody\nmay be found to be fair use, as may satire with lesser justification for the\nborrowing than would otherwise be required.\n15 Satire has been defined as a work \"in which prevalent follies or vices\nare assailed with ridicule,\" 14 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 500, or\nare \"attacked through irony, derision, or wit,\" American Heritage Diction\nary, supra, at 1604.\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nody, commenting on and criticizing the original work, what\never it may have to say about society at large.\nAs the Dis\ntrict Court remarked, the words of 2 Live Crew's song copy\nthe original's first line, but then \"quickly degenerat[e] into a\nplay on words, substituting predictable lyrics with shocking\nones . . . [that] derisively demonstrat[e] how bland and banal\nthe Orbison song seems to them.\"\n754 F. Supp., at 1155\n(footnote omitted).\nJudge Nelson, dissenting below, came to\nthe same conclusion, that the 2 Live Crew song \"was clearly\nintended to ridicule the white-bread original\" and \"reminds\nus that sexual congress with nameless streetwalkers is not\nnecessarily the stuff of romance and is not necessarily with\nout its consequences.\nThe singers (there are several) have\nthe same thing on their minds as did the lonely man with the\nnasal voice, but here there is no hint of wine and roses.\"\n972 F. 2d, at 1442.\nAlthough the majority below had diffi\nculty discerning any criticism of the original in 2 Live Crew's\nsong, it assumed for purposes of its opinion that there was\nsome.\nId., at 1435-1436, and n. 8.\nWe have less difficulty in finding that critical element in 2\nLive Crew's song than the Court of Appeals did, although\nhaving found it we will not take the further step of evaluat\ning its quality.\nThe threshold question when fair use is\nraised in defense of parody is whether a parodic character\nmay reasonably be perceived.16\nWhether, going beyond\nthat, parody is in good taste or bad does not and should not\nmatter to fair use.\nAs Justice Holmes explained, \"[i]t would\nbe a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the\nlaw to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of [a\nwork], outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits.\nAt\n16 The only further judgment, indeed, that a court may pass on a work\ngoes to an assessment of whether the parodic element is slight or great,\nand the copying small or extensive in relation to the parodic element, for\na work with slight parodic element and extensive copying will be more\nlikely to merely \"supersede the objects\" of the original.\nSee infra, at\n586-594, discussing factors three and four.\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\nthe one extreme some works of genius would be sure to miss\nappreciation.\nTheir very novelty would make them repul\nsive until the public had learned the new language in which\ntheir author spoke.\"\nBleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing\nCo., 188 U. S. 239, 251 (1903) (circus posters have copyright\nprotection); cf. Yankee Publishing Inc. v. News America\nPublishing, Inc., 809 F. Supp. 267, 280 (SDNY 1992) (Leval,\nJ.) (\"First Amendment protections do not apply only to those\nwho speak clearly, whose jokes are funny, and whose paro\ndies succeed\") (trademark case).\nWhile we might not assign a high rank to the parodic ele\nment here, we think it fair to say that 2 Live Crew's song\nreasonably could be perceived as commenting on the original\nor criticizing it, to some degree.\n2 Live Crew juxtaposes\nthe romantic musings of a man whose fantasy comes true,\nwith degrading taunts, a bawdy demand for sex, and a sigh\nof relief from paternal responsibility. The later words can\nbe taken as a comment on the naivete of the original of an\nearlier day, as a rejection of its sentiment that ignores the\nugliness of street life and the debasement that it signifies.\nIt is this joinder of reference and ridicule that marks off the\nauthor's choice of parody from the other types of comment\nand criticism that traditionally have had a claim to fair use\nprotection as transformative works.17\nThe Court of Appeals, however, immediately cut short the\nenquiry into 2 Live Crew's fair use claim by confining its\ntreatment of the first factor essentially to one relevant fact,\nthe commercial nature of the use.\nThe court then inflated\nthe significance of this fact by applying a presumption osten\n17 We note in passing that 2 Live Crew need not label their whole album,\nor even this song, a parody in order to claim fair use protection, nor should\n2 Live Crew be penalized for this being its first parodic essay.\nParody\nserves its goals whether labeled or not, and there is no reason to require\nparody to state the obvious (or even the reasonably perceived).\nSee\nPatry & Perlmutter 716-717.\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nsibly culled from Sony, that \"every commercial use of copy\nrighted material is presumptively . . . unfair . . . .\"\nSony,\n464 U. S., at 451.\nIn giving virtually dispositive weight to\nthe commercial nature of the parody, the Court of Appeals\nerred.\nThe language of the statute makes clear that the commer\ncial or nonprofit educational purpose of a work is only one\nelement of the first factor enquiry into its purpose and char\nacter.\nSection 107(1) uses the term \"including\" to begin the\ndependent clause referring to commercial use, and the main\nclause speaks of a broader investigation into \"purpose and\ncharacter.\"\nAs we explained in Harper & Row, Congress\nresisted attempts to narrow the ambit of this traditional en\nquiry by adopting categories of presumptively fair use, and\nit urged courts to preserve the breadth of their traditionally\nample view of the universe of relevant evidence.\n471 U. S.,\nat 561; House Report, p. 66.\nAccordingly, the mere fact that\na use is educational and not for profit does not insulate it\nfrom a finding of infringement, any more than the commer\ncial character of a use bars a finding of fairness.\nIf, indeed,\ncommerciality carried presumptive force against a finding of\nfairness, the presumption would swallow nearly all of the\nillustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of §107,\nincluding news reporting, comment, criticism, teaching,\nscholarship, and research, since these activities \"are gener\nally conducted for profit in this country.\"\nHarper & Row,\nsupra, at 592 (Brennan, J., dissenting).\nCongress could not\nhave intended such a rule, which certainly is not inferable\nfrom the common-law cases, arising as they did from the\nworld of letters in which Samuel Johnson could pronounce\nthat \"[n]o man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for\nmoney.\"\n3 Boswell's Life of Johnson 19 (G. Hill ed. 1934).\nSony itself called for no hard evidentiary presumption.\nThere, we emphasized the need for a \"sensitive balancing of\ninterests,\" 464 U. S., at 455, n. 40, noted that Congress had\n\"eschewed a rigid, bright-line approach to fair use,\" id., at\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\n449, n. 31, and stated that the commercial or nonprofit educa\ntional character of a work is \"not conclusive,\" id., at 448-449,\nbut rather a fact to be \"weighed along with other[s] in fair\nuse decisions,\" id., at 449, n. 32 (quoting House Report, p. 66).\nThe Court of Appeals's elevation of one sentence from Sony\nto a per se rule thus runs as much counter to Sony itself as\nto the long common-law tradition of fair use adjudication.\nRather, as we explained in Harper & Row, Sony stands for\nthe proposition that the \"fact that a publication was commer\ncial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor that tends to\nweigh against a finding of fair use.\"\n471 U. S., at 562.\nBut\nthat is all, and the fact that even the force of that tendency\nwill vary with the context is a further reason against elevat\ning commerciality to hard presumptive significance.\nThe\nuse, for example, of a copyrighted work to advertise a prod\nuct, even in a parody, will be entitled to less indulgence\nunder the first factor of the fair use enquiry than the sale of\na parody for its own sake, let alone one performed a single\ntime by students in school.\nSee generally Patry & Perlmut\nter 679-680; Fisher v. Dees, 794 F. 2d, at 437; Maxtone-\nGraham v. Burtchaell, 803 F. 2d 1253, 1262 (CA2 1986); Sega\nEnterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F. 2d 1510, 1522\n(CA9 1992).18\n18 Finally, regardless of the weight one might place on the alleged in\nfringer's state of mind, compare Harper & Row, 471 U. S., at 562 (fair use\npresupposes good faith and fair dealing) (quotation marks omitted), with\nFolsom v. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342, 349 (No. 4,901) (CCD Mass. 1841) (good\nfaith does not bar a finding of infringement); Leval 1126-1127 (good faith\nirrelevant to fair use analysis), we reject Acuff-Rose's argument that 2\nLive Crew's request for permission to use the original should be weighed\nagainst a finding of fair use.\nEven if good faith were central to fair use,\n2 Live Crew's actions do not necessarily suggest that they believed their\nversion was not fair use; the offer may simply have been made in a good-\nfaith effort to avoid this litigation.\nIf the use is otherwise fair, then no\npermission need be sought or granted.\nThus, being denied permission to\nuse a work does not weigh against a finding of fair use.\nSee Fisher v.\nDees, 794 F. 2d 432, 437 (CA9 1986).\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nB\nThe second statutory factor, \"the nature of the copy\nrighted work,\" §107(2), draws on Justice Story's expression,\nthe \"value of the materials used.\"\nFolsom v. Marsh, 9 F.\nCas., at 348.\nThis factor calls for recognition that some\nworks are closer to the core of intended copyright protection\nthan others, with the consequence that fair use is more diffi\ncult to establish when the former works are copied.\nSee,\ne. g., Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S., at 237-238 (contrasting fic\ntional short story with factual works); Harper & Row, 471\nU. S., at 563-564 (contrasting soon-to-be-published memoir\nwith published speech); Sony, 464 U. S., at 455, n. 40 (con\ntrasting motion pictures with news broadcasts); Feist, 499\nU. S., at 348-351 (contrasting creative works with bare fac\ntual compilations); 3 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on\nCopyright §13.05[A][2] (1993) (hereinafter Nimmer); Leval\n1116.\nWe agree with both the District Court and the Court\nof Appeals that the Orbison original's creative expression for\npublic dissemination falls within the core of the copyright's\nprotective purposes.\n754 F. Supp., at 1155-1156; 972 F. 2d,\nat 1437.\nThis fact, however, is not much help in this case,\nor ever likely to help much in separating the fair use sheep\nfrom the infringing goats in a parody case, since parodies\nalmost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works.\nC\nThe third factor asks whether \"the amount and substanti\nality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work\nas a whole,\" §107(3) (or, in Justice Story's words, \"the quan\ntity and value of the materials used,\" Folsom v. Marsh,\nsupra, at 348) are reasonable in relation to the purpose of\nthe copying.\nHere, attention turns to the persuasiveness of\na parodist's justification for the particular copying done, and\nthe enquiry will harken back to the first of the statutory\nfactors, for, as in prior cases, we recognize that the extent\nof permissible copying varies with the purpose and character\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\nof the use.\nSee Sony, supra, at 449-450 (reproduction of\nentire work \"does not have its ordinary effect of militating\nagainst a finding of fair use\" as to home videotaping of televi\nsion programs); Harper & Row, supra, at 564 (\"[E]ven sub\nstantial quotations might qualify as fair use in a review of a\npublished work or a news account of a speech\" but not in a\nscoop of a soon-to-be-published memoir).\nThe facts bearing\non this factor will also tend to address the fourth, by reveal\ning the degree to which the parody may serve as a market\nsubstitute for the original or potentially licensed derivatives.\nSee Leval 1123.\nThe District Court considered the song 's parodic purpose\nin finding that 2 Live Crew had not helped themselves over\nmuch.\n754 F. Supp., at 1156-1157.\nThe Court of Appeals\ndisagreed, stating that \"[w]hile it may not be inappropriate\nto find that no more was taken than necessary, the copying\nwas qualitatively substantial. . . . We conclude that taking\nthe heart of the original and making it the heart of a new\nwork was to purloin a substantial portion of the essence of\nthe original.\"\n972 F. 2d, at 1438.\nThe Court of Appeals is of course correct that this factor\ncalls for thought not only about the quantity of the materials\nused, but about their quality and importance, too.\nIn\nHarper & Row, for example, the Nation had taken only some\n300 words out of President Ford's memoirs, but we signaled\nthe significance of the quotations in finding them to amount\nto \"the heart of the book,\" the part most likely to be news\nworthy and important in licensing serialization.\n471 U. S.,\nat 564-566, 568 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe also\nagree with the Court of Appeals that whether \"a substantial\nportion of the infringing work was copied verbatim\" from\nthe copyrighted work is a relevant question, see id., at 565,\nfor it may reveal a dearth of transformative character or\npurpose under the first factor, or a greater likelihood of mar\nket harm under the fourth; a work composed primarily of an\noriginal, particularly its heart, with little added or changed,\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nis more likely to be a merely superseding use, fulfilling de\nmand for the original.\nWhere we part company with the court below is in apply\ning these guides to parody, and in particular to parody in the\nsong before us.\nParody presents a difficult case.\nParody's\nhumor, or in any event its comment, necessarily springs from\nrecognizable allusion to its object through distorted imita\ntion.\nIts art lies in the tension between a known original\nand its parodic twin.\nWhen parody takes aim at a particular\noriginal work, the parody must be able to \"conjure up\" at\nleast enough of that original to make the object of its critical\nwit recognizable.\nSee, e. g., Elsmere Music, 623 F. 2d, at\n253, n. 1; Fisher v. Dees, 794 F. 2d, at 438-439.\nWhat makes\nfor this recognition is quotation of the original's most distinc\ntive or memorable features, which the parodist can be sure\nthe audience will know.\nOnce enough has been taken to as\nsure identification, how much more is reasonable will depend,\nsay, on the extent to which the song's overriding purpose\nand character is to parody the original or, in contrast, the\nlikelihood that the parody may serve as a market substitute\nfor the original.\nBut using some characteristic features can\nnot be avoided.\nWe think the Court of Appeals was insufficiently apprecia\ntive of parody's need for the recognizable sight or sound\nwhen it ruled 2 Live Crew's use unreasonable as a matter\nof law.\nIt is true, of course, that 2 Live Crew copied\nthe characteristic opening bass riff (or musical phrase) of the\noriginal, and true that the words of the first line copy\nthe Orbison lyrics.\nBut if quotation of the opening riff and\nthe first line may be said to go to the \"heart\" of the original,\nthe heart is also what most readily conjures up the song for\nparody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim.\nCopy\ning does not become excessive in relation to parodic purpose\nmerely because the portion taken was the original's heart.\nIf 2 Live Crew had copied a significantly less memorable part\nof the original, it is difficult to see how its parodic character\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\nwould have come through.\nSee Fisher v. Dees, supra, at\n439.\nThis is not, of course, to say that anyone who calls himself\na parodist can skim the cream and get away scot free.\nIn\nparody, as in news reporting, see Harper & Row, supra, con\ntext is everything, and the question of fairness asks what\nelse the parodist did besides go to the heart of the original.\nIt is significant that 2 Live Crew not only copied the first\nline of the original, but thereafter departed markedly from\nthe Orbison lyrics for its own ends.\n2 Live Crew not only\ncopied the bass riff and repeated it,19 but also produced oth\nerwise distinctive sounds, interposing \"scraper\" noise, over\nlaying the music with solos in different keys, and altering\nthe drum beat.\nSee 754 F. Supp., at 1155.\nThis is not a\ncase, then, where \"a substantial portion\" of the parody itself\nis composed of a \"verbatim\" copying of the original.\nIt is\nnot, that is, a case where the parody is so insubstantial, as\ncompared to the copying, that the third factor must be re\nsolved as a matter of law against the parodists.\nSuffice it to say here that, as to the lyrics, we think the\nCourt of Appeals correctly suggested that \"no more was\ntaken than necessary,\" 972 F. 2d, at 1438, but just for that\nreason, we fail to see how the copying can be excessive in\nrelation to its parodic purpose, even if the portion taken is\nthe original's \"heart.\"\nAs to the music, we express no opin\nion whether repetition of the bass riff is excessive copying,\nand we remand to permit evaluation of the amount taken, in\nlight of the song's parodic purpose and character, its trans\nformative elements, and considerations of the potential for\nmarket substitution sketched more fully below.\n19 This may serve to heighten the comic effect of the parody, as one\nwitness stated, App. 32a, Affidavit of Oscar Brand; see also Elsmere\nMusic, Inc. v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F. Supp. 741, 747 (SDNY\n1980) (repetition of \"I Love Sodom\"), or serve to dazzle with the original's\nmusic, as Acuff-Rose now contends.\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\nD\nThe fourth fair use factor is \"the effect of the use upon\nthe potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\"\n§107(4).\nIt requires courts to consider not only the extent\nof market harm caused by the particular actions of the al\nleged infringer, but also \"whether unrestricted and wide\nspread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant . . .\nwould result in a substantially adverse impact on the poten\ntial market\" for the original.\nNimmer §13.05[A][4], p. 13-\n102.61 (footnote omitted); accord, Harper & Row, 471 U.

Cas., at\n349.\nThe enquiry \"must take account not only of harm to\nthe original but also of harm to the market for derivative\nworks.\"\nHarper & Row, supra, at 568.\nSince fair use is an affirmative defense,20 its proponent\nwould have difficulty carrying the burden of demonstrating\nfair use without favorable evidence about relevant markets.21\nIn moving for summary judgment, 2 Live Crew left them\nselves at just such a disadvantage when they failed to ad\ndress the effect on the market for rap derivatives, and con\nfined themselves to uncontroverted submissions that there\nwas no likely effect on the market for the original.\nThey did\nnot, however, thereby subject themselves to the evidentiary\npresumption applied by the Court of Appeals.\nIn assessing\nthe likelihood of significant market harm, the Court of Ap\n20 Harper & Row, 471 U. S., at 561; H. R. Rep. No. 102-836, p. 3, n. 3\n(1992).\n21 Even favorable evidence, without more, is no guarantee of fairness.\nJudge Leval gives the example of the film producer's appropriation of a\ncomposer's previously unknown song that turns the song into a commercial\nsuccess; the boon to the song does not make the film's simple copying\nfair.\nLeval 1124, n. 84.\nThis factor, no less than the other three, may be\naddressed only through a \"sensitive balancing of interests.\"\nSony Corp.\nof America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 455, n. 40 (1984).\nMarket harm is a matter of degree, and the importance of this factor will\nvary, not only with the amount of harm, but also with the relative strength\nof the showing on the other factors.\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\npeals quoted from language in Sony that \" '[i]f the intended\nuse is for commercial gain, that likelihood may be presumed.\nBut if it is for a noncommercial purpose, the likelihood must\nbe demonstrated.' \"\n972 F. 2d, at 1438, quoting Sony, 464\nU. S., at 451.\nThe court reasoned that because \"the use of\nthe copyrighted work is wholly commercial, . . . we presume\nthat a likelihood of future harm to Acuff-Rose exists.\"\nF. 2d, at 1438.\nIn so doing, the court resolved the fourth\nfactor against 2 Live Crew, just as it had the first, by apply\ning a presumption about the effect of commercial use, a pre\nsumption which as applied here we hold to be error.\nNo \"presumption\" or inference of market harm that might\nfind support in Sony is applicable to a case involving some\nthing beyond mere duplication for commercial purposes.\nSony's discussion of a presumption contrasts a context of\nverbatim copying of the original in its entirety for commer\ncial purposes, with the noncommercial context of Sony itself\n(home copying of television programming).\nIn the former\ncircumstances, what Sony said simply makes common sense:\nwhen a commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the\nentirety of an original, it clearly \"supersede[s] the objects,\"\nFolsom v. Marsh, supra, at 348, of the original and serves as\na market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable\nmarket harm to the original will occur.\nSony, supra, at 451.\nBut when, on the contrary, the second use is transformative,\nmarket substitution is at least less certain, and market harm\nmay not be so readily inferred.\nIndeed, as to parody pure\nand simple, it is more likely that the new work will not affect\nthe market for the original in a way cognizable under this\nfactor, that is, by acting as a substitute for it (\"supersed[ing]\n[its] objects\").\nSee Leval 1125; Patry & Perlmutter 692,\n697-698.\nThis is so because the parody and the original usu\nally serve different market functions.\nBisceglia, ASCAP,\nCopyright Law Symposium, No. 34, at 23.\nWe do not, of course, suggest that a parody may not harm\nthe market at all, but when a lethal parody, like a scathing\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nOpinion of the Court\ntheater review, kills demand for the original, it does not\nproduce a harm cognizable under the Copyright Act.\nBe\ncause \"parody may quite legitimately aim at garroting the\noriginal, destroying it commercially as well as artistically,\"\nB. Kaplan, An Unhurried View of Copyright 69 (1967), the\nrole of the courts is to distinguish between \"[b]iting criticism\n[that merely] suppresses demand [and] copyright infringe\nment[, which] usurps it.\"\nFisher v. Dees, 794 F. 2d, at 438.\nThis distinction between potentially remediable displace\nment and unremediable disparagement is reflected in the\nrule that there is no protectible derivative market for criti\ncism.\nThe market for potential derivative uses includes only\nthose that creators of original works would in general de\nvelop or license others to develop.\nYet the unlikelihood that\ncreators of imaginative works will license critical reviews or\nlampoons of their own productions removes such uses from\nthe very notion of a potential licensing market.\n\"People ask\n. . . for criticism, but they only want praise.\"\nS. Maugham,\nOf Human Bondage 241 (Penguin ed. 1992).\nThus, to the\nextent that the opinion below may be read to have consid\nered harm to the market for parodies of \"Oh, Pretty\nWoman,\" see 972 F. 2d, at 1439, the court erred.\nAccord,\nFisher v. Dees, supra, at 437; Leval 1125; Patry & Perlmut\nter 688-691.22\nIn explaining why the law recognizes no derivative market\nfor critical works, including parody, we have, of course, been\nspeaking of the later work as if it had nothing but a critical\naspect (i. e., \"parody pure and simple,\" supra, at 591).\nBut\nthe later work may have a more complex character, with ef\nfects not only in the arena of criticism but also in protectible\nmarkets for derivative works, too.\nIn that sort of case, the\nlaw looks beyond the criticism to the other elements of the\nwork, as it does here.\n2 Live Crew's song comprises not\n22 We express no opinion as to the derivative markets for works using\nelements of an original as vehicles for satire or amusement, making no\ncomment on the original or criticism of it.\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nOpinion of the Court\nonly parody but also rap music, and the derivative market\nfor rap music is a proper focus of enquiry, see Harper & Row,\nsupra, at 568; Nimmer §13.05[B].\nEvidence of substantial\nharm to it would weigh against a finding of fair use,23 because\nthe licensing of derivatives is an important economic incen\ntive to the creation of originals.\nSee 17 U. S. C. §106(2)\n(copyright\nowner\nhas\nrights\nto\nderivative\nworks).\nOf\ncourse, the only harm to derivatives that need concern us, as\ndiscussed above, is the harm of market substitution.\nThe\nfact that a parody may impair the market for derivative uses\nby the very effectiveness of its critical commentary is no\nmore relevant under copyright than the like threat to the\noriginal market.24\nAlthough 2 Live Crew submitted uncontroverted affidavits\non the question of market harm to the original, neither they,\nnor Acuff-Rose, introduced evidence or affidavits addressing\nthe likely effect of 2 Live Crew's parodic rap song on the\nmarket for a nonparody, rap version of \"Oh, Pretty Woman.\"\nAnd while Acuff-Rose would have us find evidence of a rap\nmarket in the very facts that 2 Live Crew recorded a rap\nparody of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" and another rap group sought\na license to record a rap derivative, there was no evidence\nthat a potential rap market was harmed in any way by 2\nLive Crew's parody, rap version.\nThe fact that 2 Live\nCrew's parody sold as part of a collection of rap songs says\nvery little about the parody's effect on a market for a rap\nversion of the original, either of the music alone or of the\nmusic with its lyrics.\nThe District Court essentially passed\n23 See Nimmer §13.05[A][4], p. 13-102.61 (\"a substantially adverse im\npact on the potential market\"); Leval 1125 (\"reasonably substantial\"\nharm); Patry & Perlmutter 697-698 (same).\n24 In some cases it may be difficult to determine whence the harm flows.\nIn such cases, the other fair use factors may provide some indicia of the\nlikely source of the harm.\nA work whose overriding purpose and charac\nter is parodic and whose borrowing is slight in relation to its parody will\nbe far less likely to cause cognizable harm than a work with little parodic\ncontent and much copying.\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nAppendix A to opinion of the Court\non this issue, observing that Acuff-Rose is free to record\n\"whatever version of the original it desires,\" 754 F. Supp., at\n1158; the Court of Appeals went the other way by erroneous\npresumption.\nContrary to each treatment, it is impossible\nto deal with the fourth factor except by recognizing that\na silent record on an important factor bearing on fair use\ndisentitled the proponent of the defense, 2 Live Crew, to\nsummary judgment.\nThe evidentiary hole will doubtless\nbe plugged on remand.\nIII\nIt was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the\ncommercial nature of 2 Live Crew's parody of \"Oh, Pretty\nWoman\" rendered it presumptively unfair.\nNo such eviden\ntiary presumption is available to address either the first fac\ntor, the character and purpose of the use, or the fourth, mar\nket harm, in determining whether a transformative use, such\nas parody, is a fair one.\nThe court also erred in holding that\n2 Live Crew had necessarily copied excessively from the Or-\nbison original, considering the parodic purpose of the use.\nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nand remand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDIX A TO OPINION OF THE COURT\n\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" by Roy Orbison and William Dees\nPretty Woman, walking down the street,\nPretty Woman, the kind I like to meet,\nPretty Woman, I don't believe you,\nyou're not the truth,\nNo one could look as good as you\nMercy\nPretty Woman, won't you pardon me,\nPretty Woman, I couldn't help but see,\n\nCite as: 510 U.

S. C. §107 (1988 ed. and Supp.\nIV), presumes that rules will emerge from the course of deci\nsions.\nI agree that certain general principles are now dis\ncernible to define the fair use exception for parody.\nOne of\nthese rules, as the Court observes, is that parody may qual\nify as fair use regardless of whether it is published or per\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nKennedy, J., concurring\nformed for profit.\nAnte, at 591.\nAnother is that parody\nmay qualify as fair use only if it draws upon the original\ncomposition to make humorous or ironic commentary about\nthat same composition.\nAnte, at 580.\nIt is not enough that\nthe parody use the original in a humorous fashion, however\ncreative that humor may be.\nThe parody must target the\noriginal, and not just its general style, the genre of art to\nwhich it belongs, or society as a whole (although if it targets\nthe original, it may target those features as well).\nSee Rog\ners v. Koons, 960 F. 2d 301, 310 (CA2 1992) (\"[T]hough the\nsatire need not be only of the copied work and may . . . also\nbe a parody of modern society, the copied work must be, at\nleast in part, an object of the parody\"); Fisher v. Dees, 794\nF. 2d 432, 436 (CA9 1986) (\"[A] humorous or satiric work\ndeserves protection under the fair-use doctrine only if the\ncopied work is at least partly the target of the work in ques\ntion\").\nThis prerequisite confines fair use protection to\nworks whose very subject is the original composition and\nso necessitates some borrowing from it.\nSee MCA, Inc. v.\nWilson, 677 F. 2d 180, 185 (CA2 1981) (\"[I]f the copyrighted\nsong is not at least in part an object of the parody, there is\nno need to conjure it up\"); Bisceglia, Parody and Copyright\nProtection: Turning the Balancing Act Into a Juggling Act,\nin ASCAP, Copyright Law Symposium, No. 34, pp. 23-29\n(1987).\nIt also protects works we have reason to fear will\nnot be licensed by copyright holders who wish to shield their\nworks from criticism.\nSee Fisher, supra, at 437 (\"Self\nesteem is seldom strong enough to permit the granting of\npermission even in exchange for a reasonable fee\"); Posner,\nWhen Is Parody Fair Use?, 21 J. Legal Studies 67, 73 (1992)\n(\"There is an obstruction when the parodied work is a target\nof the parodist's criticism, for it may be in the private inter\nest of the copyright owner, but not in the social interest, to\nsuppress criticism of the work\") (emphasis deleted).\nIf we keep the definition of parody within these limits, we\nhave gone most of the way towards satisfying the four-factor\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nKennedy, J., concurring\nfair use test in §107.\nThe first factor (the purpose and char\nacter of use) itself concerns the definition of parody.\nThe\nsecond factor (the nature of the copyrighted work) adds little\nto the first, since \"parodies almost invariably copy publicly\nknown, expressive works.\"\nAnte, at 586.\nThe third factor\n(the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation\nto the whole) is likewise subsumed within the definition of\nparody.\nIn determining whether an alleged parody has\ntaken too much, the target of the parody is what gives con\ntent to the inquiry.\nSome parodies, by their nature, require\nsubstantial copying.\nSee Elsmere Music, Inc. v. National\nBroadcasting Co., 623 F. 2d 252 (CA2 1980) (holding that \"I\nLove Sodom\" skit on \"Saturday Night Live\" is legitimate\nparody of the \"I Love New York\" campaign).\nOther paro\ndies, like Lewis Carroll's \"You Are Old, Father William,\"\nneed only take parts of the original composition.\nThe third\nfactor does reinforce the principle that courts should not ac\ncord fair use protection to profiteers who do no more than\nadd a few silly words to someone else's song or place the\ncharacters from a familiar work in novel or eccentric poses.\nSee, e. g., Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F. 2d\n751 (CA9 1978); DC Comics Inc. v. Unlimited Monkey Busi\nness, Inc., 598 F. Supp. 110 (ND Ga. 1984).\nBut, as I believe\nthe Court acknowledges, ante, at 588-589, it is by no means\na test of mechanical application.\nIn my view, it serves in\neffect to ensure compliance with the targeting requirement.\nAs to the fourth factor (the effect of the use on the market\nfor the original), the Court acknowledges that it is legitimate\nfor parody to suppress demand for the original by its critical\neffect.\nAnte, at 591-592.\nWhat it may not do is usurp de\nmand by its substitutive effect.\nIbid.\nIt will be difficult, of\ncourse, for courts to determine whether harm to the market\nresults from a parody's critical or substitutive effects.\nBut\nagain, if we keep the definition of parody within appropriate\nbounds, this inquiry may be of little significance.\nIf a work\ntargets another for humorous or ironic effect, it is by defini\n\nCite as: 510 U. S. 569 (1994)\nKennedy, J., concurring\ntion a new creative work.\nCreative works can compete with\nother creative works for the same market, even if their ap\npeal is overlapping.\nFactor four thus underscores the im\nportance of ensuring that the parody is in fact an independ\nent creative work, which is why the parody must \"make some\ncritical comment or statement about the original work which\nreflects the original perspective of the parodist--thereby\ngiving the parody social value beyond its entertainment\nfunction.\"\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. v. Showcase At\nlanta Cooperative Productions, Inc., 479 F. Supp. 351, 357\n(ND Ga. 1979).\nThe fair use factors thus reinforce the importance of keep\ning the definition of parody within proper limits.\nMore than\narguable parodic content should be required to deem a\nwould-be parody a fair use.\nFair use is an affirmative de\nfense, so doubts about whether a given use is fair should\nnot be resolved in favor of the self-proclaimed parodist.\nWe\nshould not make it easy for musicians to exploit existing\nworks and then later claim that their rendition was a valu\nable commentary on the original.\nAlmost any revamped\nmodern version of a familiar composition can be construed\n\nas a \"comment on the naivete of the original,\" ante, at 583,\nbecause of the difference in style and because it will be amus\ning to hear how the old tune sounds in the new genre.\nJust\nthe thought of a rap version of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony\nor \"Achy Breaky Heart\" is bound to make people smile.\nIf\nwe allow any weak transformation to qualify as parody, how\never, we weaken the protection of copyright.\nAnd under-\nprotection of copyright disserves the goals of copyright just\nas much as overprotection, by reducing the financial incen\ntive to create.\nThe Court decides it is \"fair to say that 2 Live Crew's song\nreasonably could be perceived as commenting on the original\nor criticizing it, to some degree.\"\nIbid. (applying the first\nfair use factor).\nWhile I am not so assured that 2 Live\nCrew's song is a legitimate parody, the Court's treatment of\n\nCAMPBELL v. ACUFF-ROSE MUSIC, INC.\nKennedy, J., concurring\nthe remaining factors leaves room for the District Court to\ndetermine on remand that the song is not a fair use.\nAs\nfuture courts apply our fair use analysis, they must take care\nto ensure that not just any commercial takeoff is rationalized\npost hoc as a parody.\nWith these observations, I join the opinion of the Court."

(\"Chamberlain\") appeals the November 13, 2003\nsummary judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois\n(\"District Court\") in favor of Skylink Technologies, Inc. (\"Skylink\"), finding that Skylink is\nnot violating the anti-trafficking provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n(\"DMCA\"), 17 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq., and dismissing all other claims, including claims of\npatent infringement. Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Techs., Inc., 292 F. Supp. 2d\n1040 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (\"Chamberlain II\"). That same court, in an earlier ruling, denied\nChamberlain's motion for summary judgment on its DMCA claims. Chamberlain Group,\nInc. v. Skylink Techs., Inc., 292 F. Supp. 2d 1023 (N.D. Ill 2003) (\"Chamberlain I\").\nChamberlain does not appeal that denial of its summary judgment motion.\n\nChamberlain's claims at issue stem from its allegation that the District Court\nincorrectly construed the DMCA as placing a burden upon Chamberlain to prove that\nthe circumvention of its technological measures enabled unauthorized access to its\ncopyrighted software. But Skylink's accused device enables only uses that copyright\nlaw explicitly authorizes, and is therefore presumptively legal. Chamberlain has neither\nproved nor alleged a connection between Skylink's accused circumvention device and\nthe protections that the copyright laws afford Chamberlain capable of overcoming that\npresumption. Chamberlain's failure to meet this burden alone compels a legal ruling in\nSkylink's favor. We therefore affirm the District Court's summary judgment in favor of\nSkylink.\nBACKGROUND\nA.\nThe Applicable Statute\nChamberlain sued Skylink, alleging violations of the patent and copyright laws.\nChamberlain's second amended complaint, dated March 26, 2003, enumerated eight\ncauses of action against Skylink, including the infringement of three patents. The\nmatter on appeal involves only Chamberlain's allegation that Skylink is violating the\nDMCA, specifically the anti-trafficking provision of § 1201(a)(2). The District Court first\ndenied Chamberlain's motion for summary judgment of its DMCA claim, Chamberlain I,\nand then granted Skylink's motion for summary judgment on the DMCA claim.\nChamberlain II. The District Court also dismissed all other counts.\nThe District Court's ruling, along with the appellate briefs that the parties and\namici filed with this court, raise numerous provisions of the DMCA for our consideration.\nThe key provisions at issue, however, are all in § 1201(a).\n04-1118\n\n§ 1201. Circumvention of copyright protection systems\n(a) Violations regarding circumvention of technological measures.\n(1) (A) No person shall circumvent a technological measure that\neffectively controls access to a work protected under this title. . . .\n(2) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or\notherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component,\nor part thereof, that--\n(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing\na technological measure that effectively controls access to a work\nprotected under this title;\n(B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than\nto circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a\nwork protected under this title; or\n(C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that\nperson with that person's knowledge for use in circumventing a\ntechnological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected\nunder this title.\n(3) As used in this subsection--\n(A) to \"circumvent a technological measure\" means to descramble a\nscrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid,\nbypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without\nthe authority of the copyright owner; and\n(B) a technological measure \"effectively controls access to a work\" if\nthe measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the\napplication of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of\nthe copyright owner, to gain access to the work.\n\n17 U.S.C. § 1201(a).\nB.\nThe Dispute\nThe District Court reviewed the basic facts and the underlying technology in its\ndismissal of Chamberlain's motion for summary judgment. Though the parties\nemphasize different aspects of the District Court's factual discussion, neither one\nquestions its general accuracy.\n\nThe technology at issue involves Garage Door Openers (GDOs). A GDO\ntypically consists of a hand-held portable transmitter and a garage door opening device\nmounted in a homeowner's garage. The opening device, in turn, includes both a\nreceiver with associated signal processing software and a motor to open or close the\n04-1118\n\ngarage door. In order to open or close the garage door, a user must activate the\ntransmitter, which sends a radio frequency (RF) signal to the receiver located on the\nopening device. Once the opener receives a recognized signal, the signal processing\nsoftware directs the motor to open or close the garage door.\n\nWhen a homeowner purchases a GDO system, the manufacturer provides both\nan opener and a transmitter. Homeowners who desire replacement or spare\ntransmitters can purchase them in the aftermarket. Aftermarket consumers have long\nbeen able to purchase \"universal transmitters\" that they can program to interoperate\nwith their GDO system regardless of make or model. Skylink and Chamberlain are the\nonly significant distributors of universal GDO transmitters.1 Chamberlain places no\nexplicit restrictions on the types of transmitter that the homeowner may use with its\nsystem at the time of purchase. Chamberlain's customers therefore assume that they\nenjoy all of the rights associated with the use of their GDOs and any software\nembedded therein that the copyright laws and other laws of commerce provide.\nThis dispute involves Chamberlain's Security+ line of GDOs and Skylink's Model\n39 universal transmitter. Chamberlain's Security+ GDOs incorporate a copyrighted\n\"rolling code\" computer program that constantly changes the transmitter signal needed\nto open the garage door. Skylink's Model 39 transmitter, which does not incorporate\nrolling code, nevertheless allows users to operate Security+ openers. Chamberlain\nalleges that Skylink's transmitter renders the Security+ insecure by allowing\nunauthorized users to circumvent the security inherent in rolling codes. Of greater legal\n\nChamberlain's product, the \"Clicker,\" interoperates with both Chamberlain\nand non-Chamberlain GDOs.\n04-1118\n\nsignificance, however, Chamberlain contends that because of this property of the Model\n39, Skylink is in violation of the anti-trafficking clause of the DMCA's anticircumvention\nprovisions, specifically § 1201(a)(2).\nThe code in a standard (i.e., non-rolling code) GDO transmitter is unique but\nfixed. Thus, according to Chamberlain, the typical GDO is vulnerable to attack by\nburglars who can open the garage door using a \"code grabber.\" According to\nChamberlain, code grabbers allow burglars in close proximity to a homeowner operating\nher garage door to record the signal sent from the transmitter to the opener, and to\nreturn later, replay the recorded signal, and open the garage door. Chamberlain\nconcedes, however, that code grabbers are more theoretical than practical burgling\ndevices; none of its witnesses had either firsthand knowledge of a single code grabbing\nproblem or familiarity with data demonstrating the existence of a problem.\nNevertheless, Chamberlain claims to have developed its rolling code system specifically\nto prevent code grabbing.2\nThe essence of the rolling code system is that the transmitted signals are broken\ninto fixed and variable (or \"rolling\") components. The entire transmitted signal is a bit\nstring. The fixed component serves to identify the transmitter. The rolling component\ncycles through a lengthy cycle of bit strings only some of which are capable of opening\nthe door at any given time, ostensibly so that a burglar replaying a grabbed code is\nunlikely to send a valid signal--and therefore unlikely to open the garage door.\n\nAccording to Skylink, Chamberlain introduced rolling codes to prevent\ninadvertent GDO activation by planes passing overhead, not as a security measure.\n04-1118\n\nA user wishing to set up a new transmitter for use with her Security+ GDO must\nswitch the opener to \"program mode\" and send a signal from the transmitter to the\nopener. The opener stores both the fixed and rolling components of the transmitted\nsignal. When the user switches the opener back to \"operate mode,\" the system is set\nand the user may operate the opener with the newly programmed transmitter. In\nChamberlain's transmitter, a computer program increases the rolling code by a factor of\nthree each time the user activates the transmitter. When the transmitted signal reaches\nthe receiver, a program in the opener checks to see whether the rolling code received\nwas identical to one of the most recently received 1,024 rolling codes (the \"rear\nwindow\"). If so, it will not activate the motor. If, on the other hand, the rolling code\nreceived is among the next 4,096 binary signals (the \"forward window\"), the receiver will\nactivate the motor.\nNot all recognized binary rolling signals are in either the forward or rear windows.\nIf the transmitter sends a single signal outside of either window, the receiver will ignore\nit. If, however, the transmitter sends two signals outside either window in rapid\nsuccession, the opener will again access its programming, this time to determine\nwhether the two signals together comprise a \"resynchronization\" sequence. If the\nsignals differ by three, the receiver will reset the windows and activate the motor.\nAccording to Chamberlain, resynchronization accommodates the possibility that\nhomeowners using the same transmitter for multiple residences may transmit so many\nsignals while out of range of the opener that they exhaust the entire forward window.\nSkylink began marketing and selling universal transmitters in 1992. Skylink\ndesigned its Model 39, launched in August 2002, to interoperate with common GDOs,\n04-1118\n\nincluding both rolling code and non-rolling code GDOs.3 Although Chamberlain\nconcedes that the Model 39 transmitter is capable of operating many different GDOs, it\nnevertheless asserts that Skylink markets the Model 39 transmitter for use in\ncircumventing its copyrighted rolling code computer program. Chamberlain supports\nthis allegation by pointing to the Model 39's setting that operates only Chamberlain's\nrolling code GDOs.\nSkylink's Model 39 does not use rolling code technology. Like Chamberlain's\nproducts, however, the Model 39's binary signal contains two components. The first\ncorresponds to the Chamberlain's fixed component identifying the transmitter, and the\nsecond simulates the effect of the Chamberlain's rolling code. Like the Chamberlain\nfixed component, the primary role of the Model 39's identifying component is in\nprogramming; a homeowner wishing to use a Model 39 in conjunction with a\nChamberlain GDO must program the opener to recognize his newly purchased\ntransmitter. When the homeowner actually uses the transmitter, it broadcasts three\nfixed codes in rapid succession. The first binary signal combines the identifying\ncomponent with an arbitrary binary sequence. The second binary signal subtracts 1800\nfrom the first signal. The third signal adds three to the second signal. The combination\nof these three codes transmitted with every press of the Model 39 transmitter button will\neither cause the Chamberlain GDO to operate in response to the first fixed code or\ncause the GDO to resynchronize and operate in response to the second and third fixed\n\nThe Model 39 interoperates with at least 15 different brands and dozens of\ndifferent GDO models, only a few of which include Chamberlain's rolling code. One of\nthe Model 39's settings interoperates only with Chamberlain rolling code GDOs.\n\n04-1118\n\ncodes. Chamberlain characterizes this procedure as a circumvention of an important\nsecurity measure; a code grabber that recorded the Model 39's three codes could later\nplay them back and activate a Chamberlain rolling code GDO without authorization.\nThese facts frame the dispute now before us on appeal. Though only\nChamberlain's DMCA claim is before us, and though the parties dispute whether or not\nSkylink developed the Model 39 independent of Chamberlain's copyrighted products,4 it\nis nevertheless noteworthy that Chamberlain has not alleged either that Skylink\ninfringed its copyright or that Skylink is liable for contributory copyright infringement.\nWhat Chamberlain has alleged is that because its opener and transmitter both\nincorporate computer programs \"protected by copyright\" and because rolling codes are\na \"technological measure\" that \"controls access\" to those programs, Skylink is prima\nfacie liable for violating § 1201(a)(2). In the District Court's words, \"Chamberlain claims\nthat the rolling code computer program has a protective measure that protects itself.\nThus, only one computer program is at work here, but it has two functions: (1) to verify\nthe rolling code; and (2) once the rolling code is verified, to activate the GDO motor, by\nsending instructions to a microprocessor in the GDO.\" Chamberlain I, 292 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1028.\n\nAccording to Chamberlain, the transmitter program is registered with the\nUnited States Copyright Office as No. TX5-533-065, and the computer program in the\nreceiver is registered with the United States Copyright Office as No. TX5-549-995. The\nparties dispute whether the code used in the program is precisely the registered code or\na slight variation thereof, possibly qualifying as a derivative work. Because this appeal\nis of a summary judgment favoring Skylink, however, we view all disputed facts in the\nlight most favorable to Chamberlain, and therefore assume that all programs in question\nare fully protected by the copyright laws.\n04-1118\n\nC.\nThe Summary Judgment Motions\nThe District Court first considered Chamberlain's motion for summary judgment\non its DMCA claim. Chamberlain I. Chamberlain sued Skylink under 17 U.S.C. §\n1201(a)(2), a statutory provision that neither the Seventh Circuit nor any previous\nDistrict Court in the Seventh Circuit had ever considered. To date, in fact, only the\nSecond Circuit has construed § 1201(a)(2), and that construction focused on First\nAmendment issues rather than on an application of the statute to case-specific facts.\nSee Universal City Studios v. Corley, 273 F.3d 429 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"Corley\"). The\nDistrict Court therefore correctly viewed this case as a matter of first impression, and\nprovided detailed analyses of Chamberlain's various arguments and Skylink's proffered\ndefenses.\nAt the end of this review, the District Court denied Chamberlain's motion for\nsummary judgment. Chamberlain does not appeal this denial. The District Court,\nhowever, did refer back to its discussions numerous times in its consideration and grant\nof Skylink's motion for summary judgment, the subject of the current appeal. In fact, the\nDistrict Court's discussion of Skylink's motion began by \"assum[ing] the reader's\nfamiliarity with [its] earlier decision.\" Chamberlain II, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 1042.\nUnderstanding the District Court's denial of Chamberlain's summary judgment motion is\ntherefore critical to understanding its grant of Skylink's summary judgment motion.\nChamberlain's argument, submitted in both summary judgment motions, rests on\nits interpretation of the statute's \"plain language.\" Chamberlain contends first, that\nSkylink \"primarily designed or produced [the Model 39] for the purpose of circumventing\n[Chamberlain's rolling code] technological measure that effectively controls access to\n04-1118\n\n[Chamberlain's copyrighted computer programs],\" contravening § 1201(a)(2)(A);\nsecond, that the Model 39 \"has only limited commercially significant purpose or use\nother than to circumvent [Chamberlain's rolling code] technological measure that\neffectively controls access to [Chamberlain's copyrighted computer programs],\"\ncontravening § 1201(a)(2)(B); and third, that Skylink marketed the Model 39 \"for use in\ncircumventing [Chamberlain's rolling code] technological measure that effectively\ncontrols access to [Chamberlain's copyrighted computer programs],\" contravening §\n1201(a)(2)(C). Chamberlain I, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 1035.\nSkylink submitted several defenses, arguing that: (1) the Model 39 transmitter\nserves a variety of functions that are unrelated to circumvention; (2) Chamberlain has\nfailed to demonstrate that its GDOs contain a computer program protected by copyright;\n(3) consumers use the Model 39 transmitter to activate the Security+ GDOs with\nChamberlain's consent; (4) Skylink has not violated the DMCA because it falls within a\nsafe harbor provision per § 1201(f);5 and (5) Chamberlain's rolling code computer\n\n§ 1201. Circumvention of copyright protection systems. . .\n(f) Reverse engineering.\n(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who\nhas lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may\ncircumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a\nparticular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and\nanalyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve\ninteroperability of an independently created computer program with other\nprograms. . . to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do\nnot constitute infringement under this title. . . .\n(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term \"interoperability\" means the\nability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such\nprograms mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.\n17 U.S.C. § 1201(f). Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), first\nas an amicus to the District Court and now as an amicus to this court, submitted §\n1201(f) as an alternative basis for finding in favor of Skylink.\n04-1118\n\nprogram does not protect a copyrighted computer program, but instead protects an\nuncopyrightable process. Id. at 1035-36. Though the District Court commented on all\nof these arguments, it based its rulings entirely on Skylink's third argument concerning\nauthorization and consent.\nChamberlain submitted two arguments in response to Skylink's assertion that\nChamberlain authorized its customers to use the Model 39. First, Chamberlain argued\nthat Skylink bore the burden of proving that its behavior was authorized, and that\nSkylink's argument was therefore, at best, an affirmative defense rather than a defect in\nits own pleadings. Chamberlain II, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 1044. Second, Chamberlain\nnoted that it never gave consumers explicit authorization to program competing\nuniversal transmitters into its rolling code openers, at least in part because it never\nanticipated that any competitor would crack its code. Skylink did not dispute this point,\nbut asserted simply that in the absence of an explicit restriction, consumers must be\nfree to infer that they have purchased the full range of rights that normally accompany\nconsumer products--including those containing copyrighted embedded software.\nIn assessing the authorization issue, the District Court noted that according to the\nstatute's internal definitions, \"circumvent a technological measure\" means to\n\"descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid,\nbypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of\nthe copyright owner.\" Id. at 1043 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(3)(A)) (emphasis added by\nthe District Court).\nAccording to undisputed facts, a homeowner who purchases a Chamberlain\nGDO owns it and has a right to use it to access his or her own garage. At the time of\n04-1118\n\nsale, Chamberlain does not place any explicit terms or condition on use to limit the ways\nthat a purchaser may use its products. A homeowner who wishes to use a Model 39\nmust first program it into the GDO. Skylink characterizes this action as the\nhomeowner's authorization of the Model 39 to interoperate with the GDO. In other\nwords, according to Skylink, Chamberlain GDO consumers who purchase a Skylink\ntransmitter have Chamberlain's implicit permission to purchase and to use any brand of\ntransmitter that will open their GDO. The District Court agreed that Chamberlain's\nunconditioned sale implied authorization. Id.\nChamberlain also argued that its web page and warranty implied restrictions on\nthe use of competing transmitters. The District Court, however, refused to read an\nimplicit restriction from the mere absence of competing products discussed on\nChamberlain's web page, particularly given the longstanding industry practice of\nmarketing universal transmitters. The District Court rejected the alleged implications of\nChamberlain's warranties even more strongly, noting that consumers are always free to\nforego the benefits of a product's warranty and to use consumer products in any way\nthat they choose. The District Court similarly rejected Chamberlain's reiteration of the\narguments that had proved unpersuasive in its own summary judgment motion to\ndefend itself against Skylink's summary judgment motion.\nThe District Court further noted that under Chamberlain's proposed construction\nof the DMCA, not only would Skylink be in violation of § 1201(a)(2) (prohibiting\ntrafficking in circumvention devices), but Chamberlain's own customers who used a\nModel 39 would be in violation of § 1201(a)(1) (prohibiting circumvention). The District\n04-1118\n\nCourt declined to adopt a construction with such dire implications. See Chamberlain I,\n292 F. Supp. 2d at 1039-40.\nIn short, the District Court concluded that because Chamberlain never restricted\nits customers' use of competing transmitters with its Security+ line, those customers\nhad implicit authorization to use Skylink's Model 39. Because of that implicit\nauthorization, Chamberlain could not possibly meet its burden of proving that Skylink\ntrafficked in a device designed to circumvent a technological measure to gain\nunauthorized access to Chamberlain's copyrighted computer programs. The District\nCourt therefore granted Skylink's motion for summary judgment on Chamberlain's\nDMCA claim. Chamberlain timely appealed only the District Court's final judgment in\nfavor of Skylink on Chamberlain's DMCA claim, not the District Court's denial of its own\nsummary judgment motion.\nDISCUSSION\nA.\nJurisdiction\nThough we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1),\nthat finding rests upon a detailed jurisdictional inquiry. Chamberlain's initial complaint\ndescribed \"an action for patent infringement arising under the Patent Laws of the United\nStates, 35 U.S.C. §§ 271 et seq. and for copyright infringement arising under the\nCopyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1201.\" The complaint stated four counts; three involved\ninfringement of Chamberlain patents. Subsequent amendments to the complaint added\nfour more non-patent claims. There is therefore little doubt that, both as filed and as\namended, the District Court's jurisdiction \"arose under\" the patent laws, at least in part.\n04-1118\n\nChamberlain argues, with some justification, that this characterization of its\ncomplaint alone is enough to confer appellate jurisdiction on this court. According to\nChamberlain, the Supreme Court's emphasis of the well-pleaded complaint rule in\ndetermining our jurisdiction requires us to inquire only whether the District Court's\njurisdiction \"arose under\" the patent laws, at least in part. See Holmes Group v.\nVornado Air Circulation Sys., 535 U.S. 826, 829 (2002). Skylink does not dispute this\npoint. Nevertheless, \"[e]very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy\nitself . . . of its own jurisdiction . . . even though the parties are prepared to concede it.\"\nBender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986) (citations omitted).\nThough both our precedent and the Supreme Court's dicta concerning cases, such as\nthis one, where all patent issues were dismissed and only non-patent issues are on\nappeal, support our jurisdiction, the determination is not as clear cut as Chamberlain\ncontends--in part because of the unusual language that the District Court used in\ndismissing the claims other than Count III, the DMCA claim that is the subject of this\nappeal.\nThe District Court first dismissed one of Chamberlain's patent claims, Count II,\n\"without prejudice to Plaintiff's reasserting its '703 patent claims if the Federal Circuit\nreverses Judge Conlon's decision in Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Interlogix, Inc., No. 01\nC6157.\" Chamberlain and Interlogix settled their case while it was on appeal. This\ncourt then remanded the matter for \"the purpose of allowing the District Court to\nconsider the parties' motion to vacate its judgment.\" Chamberlain Group, Inc. v.\n04-1118\n\nInterlogix, Inc., 75 Fed. Appx. 786 (Fed. Cir. 2003).6 Though the Interlogix trial court\nsubsequently denied that motion, Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Interlogix, Inc., No. 01-\nC6157, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9851 (N.D. Ill., May 27, 2004), that denial in no way\ndisturbed the settlement. As a result, there is no longer any set of circumstances under\nwhich this court could \"reverse Judge Conlon's decision.\" Chamberlain can no longer\nreassert Count II in any forum. The District Court's dismissal of Count II, though styled\nas \"without prejudice subject to a condition subsequent,\" has ripened into a dismissal\nwith prejudice, and therefore serves as an adjudication on the merits of Count II.\nThe District Court's effective adjudication of Count II confirmed Federal Circuit\njurisdiction to hear all appeals from the final judgment in this matter, 28 U.S.C. §\n1295(a)(1), by assuring that the District Court's own jurisdiction arose in part under the\npatent laws. See Holmes, 535 U.S. at 826. At the time that the District Court dismissed\nCount II, however, numerous other claims and counterclaims remained unresolved.\nShortly thereafter, though, and subject to stipulation by the parties, the District Court\ndismissed all remaining claims other than Count III, the DMCA claim:\nCounts IV through VII of the Second Amended Complaint and Counts I\nthrough VII of the Amended Answer and Counterclaim are dismissed with\nprejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a). Counts I and VIII of the\nSecond Amended Complaint are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to\nFed.R.Civ.P. 41(a). The dismissal of the patent claims is without prejudice\nsolely\nfor\nthe\npurpose\nof\npermitting\nthe\nmaintenance\nof\nthe\n\nUnpublished opinions of the Federal Circuit may not be cited as\nprecedent, but are nevertheless binding on the parties. Because of the wording of the\nDistrict Court's dismissal, this particular unpublished opinion is critical to determining the\nstatus of Count II in the present matter.\n04-1118\n\npatent claims in the ITC investigation and nowhere else as per agreement\nof the parties.7\n\nCounts I, II, and VIII were the only patent claims in the Second Amended Complaint.\nThis broad dismissal rendered the District Court's summary judgment for Skylink on the\nDMCA claim a final judgment from which Chamberlain could appeal.\nThough we have never before had to consider our jurisdiction over matters in\nwhich a trial court dismissed all patent claims using precisely the language that this\nDistrict Court did in dismissing Claims I, II, and VIII, our precedent is clear. Federal\nCircuit jurisdiction depends on whether the plaintiff's complaint as amended raises\npatent law issues. Gronholz v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 836 F.2d 515, 519 (Fed. Cir.\n1987); see also Holmes, 535 U.S. at 829 n.1; Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating\nCorp., 486 U.S. 800, 822-24 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring); Holmes, 535 U.S. at 835\n(Stevens, J., concurring). Where, as here, all of the patent claims in the amended\ncomplaint were dismissed prior to the non-patent ruling on appeal, the dispositive\nquestion is whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. Nilssen v. Motorola,\nInc., 203 F.3d 782, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2000).\nDismissals without prejudice are de facto amendments to the complaint.\nGronholz, 836 F.2d at 519. For the purposes of determining Federal Circuit jurisdiction,\nwe do not differentiate between actual and constructive amendments; both divest us of\n\nAccording to the District Court, Chamberlain also argued that it never\nauthorized its customers to use Model 39 transmitters in a separate action in front of the\nInternational Trade Commission (\"ITC\"). In the Matter of Certain Universal Transmitters\nfor Garage Door Openers (\"Matter of GDOs\"), Inv. No. 337-TA-497, 2003 WL, slip op. at\n39, 41-42 (Nov. 4, 2003). The ITC's Administrative Law Judge rejected the argument.\nSee Chamberlain II, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 1044-45. That matter is the subject of a\nseparate appeal still pending.\n04-1118\n\njurisdiction if they eliminate all issues of patent law. See id. Dismissals with prejudice\nare adjudications on the merits, and not constructive amendments to the complaint.\nZenith Elecs. Corp. v. Exzec, Inc., 182 F.3d 1340, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In all such\ncases, we retain jurisdiction to hear all appeals on all issues. See id.\nTaken together, whenever the complaint included a patent claim and the trial\ncourt's rulings altered the legal status of the parties with respect to that patent claim, we\nretain appellate jurisdiction over all pendent claims in the complaint. See Atari, Inc. v.\nJS & A Group, Inc., 747 F.2d 1422, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (en banc) overruled on other\ngrounds by, Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovation, Inc. 141 F.3d 1059 (1998) (en banc\nin relevant part); Zenith, 182 F.3d at 1346; Nilssen, 203 F.3d at 785. In other words, if\nall patent claims raised in the amended complaint were dismissed without prejudice, the\ndismissal would divest us of jurisdiction; dismissals with prejudice would not. Nilssen,\n203 F.3d at 785. Neither the specific rule under which the District Court dismissed the\nclaims nor the wording of the dismissal alters the fundamental basis of our jurisdiction.\nId. Dismissals divest this court of jurisdiction only if \"[t]he parties were left in the same\nlegal position with respect to [all] patent claims as if they had never been filed.\" Id.\n\"[T]he dismissal of a claim with prejudice operate[s] as an adjudication of that claim on\nthe merits,\" id., and preserves our jurisdiction.\nOur jurisdiction in the present matter therefore hinges on whether one or more of\nthe District Court's dismissals altered the legal positions of Chamberlain and Skylink vis-\na-vis the dismissed claim. The Supreme Court has defined the difference between\ndismissals with and without prejudice:\nThe primary meaning of \"dismissal without prejudice,\" we think, is\ndismissal without barring the defendant from returning later, to the same\n04-1118\n\ncourt, with the same underlying claim. That will also ordinarily (though not\nalways) have the consequence of not barring the claim from other courts,\nbut its primary meaning relates to the dismissing court itself. Thus,\nBlack's Law Dictionary (7th ed. 1999) defines \"dismissed without\nprejudice\" as \"removed from the court's docket in such a way that the\nplaintiff may refile the same suit on the same claim,\" id. at 482, and\ndefines \"dismissal without prejudice\" as \"[a] dismissal that does not bar\nthe plaintiff from refiling the lawsuit within the applicable limitations period,\nibid.\"\n\nSemtek Int'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 505-06 (2001). This\ndistinction is functional, rather than semantic. Notwithstanding the District Court's\nsemantic characterization of its dismissal of Claim II as \"without prejudice\" subject to a\ncondition subsequent that can no longer occur, and of Claims I and VIII as \"without\nprejudice\" except in a single forum, Chamberlain is barred from reasserting these\nclaims. The District Court's dismissals clearly fail to meet the Supreme Court's\ndefinition of \"dismissal without prejudice\" because they alter the legal status of the\nparties vis-a-vis all of Chamberlain's asserted patent claims. Chamberlain and Skylink\nwere not \"left in the same legal position with respect to the patent claims as if they had\nnever been filed.\" Nilssen, 203 F.3d at 785. We therefore have jurisdiction to hear this\nappeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1).\nB.\nThe Parties' Positions\nOn appeal, the parties have raised a number of issues that we must address\nboth as matters of statutory construction and as they relate to the factual disposition of\nthis case. Chamberlain argues that \"Skylink violates the prima facie requirement of anti-\ntrafficking § 1201(a)(2).\" According to Chamberlain, \"Skylink did not seriously dispute\nthat the operation of its transmitters bypasses Chamberlain's rolling code security\nmeasure to gain access to Chamberlain's copyrighted GDO receiver operating software,\n04-1118\n\nbut instead focuses on an 'authorization' defense.\" Given that \"plain language\"\ninterpretation of the statute, Chamberlain also argues that the District Court erred in\nassigning the plaintiff the burden of proving that access was unauthorized rather than\nplacing the burden on the defendant to prove that the access was authorized. Finally,\nwith the burden thus shifted, Chamberlain argues that Skylink has not met its burden,\nand that the District Court's grant of summary judgment was therefore in error.\nSkylink primarily urges us to adopt both the District Court's construction and its\napplication of its construction to the facts of this case. In particular, Skylink urges us not\nto place the burden of proving authorization on defendants, arguing that it would be\ntantamount to reading a new \"authority\" requirement into the DMCA.8 To resolve this\ndispute, we must first construe the relevant portions of the DMCA, and then apply the\nstatute, properly construed, to the specific facts at issue.\nC.\nStandard of Review\nTo resolve issues of substantive copyright law, this court applies the law as\ninterpreted by the regional circuits, in this case the Seventh Circuit. See Atari Games\nCorp. v. Nintendo of Am., Inc., 975 F.2d 832, 837 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Because this matter\n\nTwo amici urging us to affirm raised additional arguments that warrant\nmention. Amicus Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) urges us\nto consider the import of § 1201(f), which explicitly allows circumvention for the\npurposes of achieving interoperability. Amicus Consumers Union (CU) urges us to\nconsider the policy implications of Chamberlain's proposed construction to consumers\nand to aftermarket competitors. According to CU, Chamberlain's proposed construction\nof the DMCA would enable copyright owners to engage in a number of practices that\nwould otherwise be considered copyright misuse, an antitrust violation, or a violation of\nstate unfair competition laws. At oral argument, Chamberlain conceded that its\nproposed construction would, indeed, alter virtually all existing consumer expectations\nconcerning the public's rights to use purchased products containing copyrighted\nsoftware protected by a technological measure--effectively confirming CU's fears.\n04-1118\n\ncame to us following a summary judgment, we must apply the Seventh Circuit's\nstandard of review for summary judgments. This standard does not differ from circuit to\ncircuit. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48\n(1986). Appellate courts review summary judgment motions de novo, viewing the\nrecord and all inferences from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\nSchmidt v. Ottawa Med. Ctr., P.C., 322 F.3d 461, 463 (7th Cir. 2003). Summary\njudgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\nwhere the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.\n\nOur task is essentially one of statutory construction. It is also a matter of first\nimpression. For us to determine whether or not Skylink was entitled to summary\njudgment that its Model 39 universal transmitter does not violate the DMCA, we must\nfirst determine precisely what § 1201(a)(2) prohibits. The Seventh Circuit has\nconsidered the DMCA only once, in In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F.3d 643,\n655 (7th Cir. 2003). That case involved provisions of the DMCA other than those at\nissue here. To the extent that the Seventh Circuit provided any useful guidance to our\nconsideration of the DMCA, it can be captured in two simple sentences: \"The DMCA is\nan attempt to deal with special problems created by the so-called digital revolution. . . .\nThe Act does not abolish contributory infringement.\" Id. As a result, there is no binding\nprecedent governing the substantive issues in this case. The parties have provided\nnumerous citations to persuasive authority from other regional circuits and from District\nCourts, primarily but not exclusively Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F.\nSupp. 2d 294, 319 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (\"Reimerdes\"), aff'd sub nom. Universal City Studios\n04-1118\n\nv. Corley, 273 F.3d 429 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"Corley\").9 The parties pointed the District Court\ntoward this case as well, and the District Court relied in part upon the Reimerdes\nanalysis in its own construction of the DMCA. See Chamberlain I, 292 F. Supp. 2d at\n1036-40; Chamberlain II, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 1045.\nThe general methodology guiding a court's construction of a statute is well\nestablished, and is the same in the Seventh Circuit as it is in the Federal Circuit.\nCompare Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Bush, 918 F.2d 1323, 1327 (7th Cir. 1990), with\nMadison Galleries, Ltd. v. United States, 870 F.2d 627, 630 (Fed. Cir. 1989). We must\nstart with the language of the statute. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake\nBay Found., 484 U.S. 49, 56 (1987). If the statute is unambiguous, our inquiry is at an\nend; we must enforce the congressional intent embodied in that plain wording. See\nUnited States v. Clark, 454 U.S. 555, 560 (1982). \"When a syntactical analysis of the\nstatutory language does not yield a satisfactory answer with respect to the intent of the\nCongress, we must employ other less satisfactory means to ascertain, as best we can,\nthe legislative will.\" Bethlehem Steel, 918 F.2d at 1327. In such cases, investigations\nof the statute's structure and of relevant legislative history can both provide useful\ninsights to help us construe the statute in the way most consistent with congressional\nintent. See, e.g., Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001); Whitman v. Am.\nTrucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 490 (2001); Boim v. Quranic Literacy Inst., 291 F.3d\n1000, 1019 (7th Cir. 2002). \"Policy considerations cannot override our interpretation of\n\nBoth parties relied on the trial court's decision in this case, rather than the\nSecond Circuit's decision, presumably because the trial court, but not the Court of\nAppeals, addressed § 1201(a)(2)(A).\n\n04-1118\n\nthe text and structure of [a statute], except to the extent that they may help to show that\nadherence to the text and structure would lead to a result so bizarre that Congress\ncould not have intended it.\" Central Bank, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank, N.A., 511 U.S.\n164, 188 (1994).\nD.\nThe Statute and Liability under the DMCA\nThe essence of the DMCA's anticircumvention provisions is that §§ 1201(a),(b)\nestablish causes of action for liability. They do not establish a new property right. The\nDMCA's text indicates that circumvention is not infringement, 17 U.S.C. § 1201(c)(1)\n(\"Nothing in this section shall affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to\ncopyright infringement, including fair use, under this title.\"), and the statute's structure\nmakes the point even clearer. This distinction between property and liability is critical.\nWhereas copyrights, like patents, are property, liability protection from unauthorized\ncircumvention merely creates a new cause of action under which a defendant may be\nliable. The distinction between property and liability goes straight to the issue of\nauthorization, the issue upon which the District Court both denied Chamberlain's and\ngranted Skylink's motion for summary judgment.\nA plaintiff alleging copyright infringement need prove only \"(1) ownership of a\nvalid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\"\nFeist Pub., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991); see also Harris\nCustom Builders, Inc. v. Hoffmeyer, 92 F.3d 517, 519 (7th Cir. 1996). \"[T]he existence\nof a license, exclusive or nonexclusive, creates an affirmative defense to a claim of\ncopyright infringement.\" I.A.E., Inc. v. Shaver, 74 F.3d 768, 775 (7th Cir. 1996). In\nother words, under Seventh Circuit copyright law, a plaintiff only needs to show that the\n04-1118\n\ndefendant has used her property; the burden of proving that the use was authorized\nfalls squarely on the defendant. Id. The DMCA, however, defines circumvention as an\nactivity undertaken \"without the authority of the copyright owner.\" 17 U.S.C. §\n1201(a)(3)(A). The plain language of the statute therefore requires a plaintiff alleging\ncircumvention (or trafficking) to prove that the defendant's access was unauthorized--a\nsignificant burden where, as here, the copyright laws authorize consumers to use the\ncopy of Chamberlain's software embedded in the GDOs that they purchased. The\npremise underlying this initial assignment of burden is that the copyright laws authorize\nmembers of the public to access a work, but not to copy it. The law therefore places the\nburden of proof on the party attempting to establish that the circumstances of its case\ndeviate from these normal expectations; defendants must prove authorized copying and\nplaintiffs must prove unauthorized access.\nThe distinction between property and liability also addresses an important policy\nissue that Chamberlain puts into stark focus.10 According to Chamberlain, the 1998\nenactment of the DMCA \"renders the pre-DMCA history in the GDO industry irrelevant.\nBy prohibiting the trafficking and use of circumvention technology, the DMCA\nfundamentally altered the legal landscape. . . . Any analysis of practices within the\nGDO industry must now be undertaken in light of the DMCA.\" Chamberlain reiterated\nand strengthened this assertion at oral argument, claiming that the DMCA overrode all\npre-existing consumer expectations about the legitimate uses of products containing\ncopyrighted embedded software. Chamberlain contends that Congress empowered\n\nAmicus CU also raised this issue in its brief to this court.\n\n04-1118\n\nmanufacturers to prohibit consumers from using embedded software products in\nconjunction with competing products when it passed § 1201(a)(1). According to\nChamberlain, all such uses of products containing copyrighted software to which a\ntechnological measure controlled access are now per se illegal under the DMCA unless\nthe manufacturer provided consumers with explicit authorization. Chamberlain's\ninterpretation of the DMCA would therefore grant manufacturers broad exemptions from\nboth the antitrust laws and the doctrine of copyright misuse.\nSuch an exemption, however, is only plausible if the anticircumvention provisions\nestablished a new property right capable of conflicting with the copyright owner's other\nlegal responsibilities--which as we have already explained, they do not. The\nanticircumvention provisions convey no additional property rights in and of themselves;\nthey simply provide property owners with new ways to secure their property. Like all\nproperty owners taking legitimate steps to protect their property, however, copyright\nowners relying on the anticircumvention provisions remain bound by all other relevant\nbodies of law. Contrary to Chamberlain's assertion, the DMCA emphatically did not\n\"fundamentally alter\" the legal landscape governing the reasonable expectations of\nconsumers or competitors; did not \"fundamentally alter\" the ways that courts analyze\nindustry practices; and did not render the pre-DMCA history of the GDO industry\nirrelevant.\nWhat the DMCA did was introduce new grounds for liability in the context of the\nunauthorized access of copyrighted material. The statute's plain language requires\nplaintiffs to prove that those circumventing their technological measures controlling\naccess did so \"without the authority of the copyright owner.\" 17 U.S.C. § 1201(3)(A).\n04-1118\n\nOur inquiry ends with that clear language. We note, however, that the statute's\nstructure, legislative history, and context within the Copyright Act all support our\nconstruction. They also help to explain why Chamberlain's warranty conditions and\nwebsite postings cannot render users of Skylink's Model 39 \"unauthorized\" users for the\npurposes of establishing trafficking liability under the DMCA.\nE.\nStatutory Structure and Legislative History\nThe specific statutory provision here at issue is § 1201(a)(2) of the DMCA. The\nstructure of the DMCA follows logically from the textual provisions distinguishing\ncircumvention from infringement. The provisions relevant to circumvention are all in a\nnew chapter of the Copyright Act, Chapter 12, titled \"Copyright Protection and\nManagement System.\" Violators may be subject to the new civil penalties of § 1203\nand the criminal penalties of § 1204, but they are not necessarily liable for copyright\ninfringement.\nThe Second Circuit, as a precursor to its constitutional analysis, summarized the\nstatute's history and structure:\nThe DMCA was enacted in 1998 to implement the World Intellectual\nProperty Organization Copyright Treaty (\"WIPO Treaty\"), which requires\ncontracting parties to \"provide adequate legal protection and effective\nlegal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological\nmeasures that are used by authors in connection with the exercise of their\nrights under this Treaty or the Berne Convention and that restrict acts, in\nrespect of their works, which are not authorized by the authors concerned\nor permitted by law.\"11 Even before the treaty, Congress had been\ndevoting attention to the problems faced by copyright enforcement in the\ndigital age. Hearings on the topic have spanned several years. . . . This\nlegislative effort resulted in the DMCA.\n\nWIPO Treaty, Apr. 12, 1997, art. 11, S. Treaty Doc. No. 105-17 (1997),\navailable at 1997 WL 447232.\n04-1118\n\nThe Act contains three provisions targeted at the circumvention of\ntechnological protections. The first is subsection 1201(a)(1)(A), the anti-\ncircumvention provision. This provision prohibits a person from\n\"circumvent[ing] a technological measure that effectively controls access\nto a work protected under [Title 17, governing copyright].\" . . .\nThe second and third provisions are subsections 1201(a)(2) and\n1201(b)(1), the \"anti-trafficking provisions.\" . . . Subsection 1201(a)(1)\ndiffers from both of these anti-trafficking subsections in that it targets the\nuse of a circumvention technology, not the trafficking in such a technology.\nThe DMCA contains exceptions, . . . [id. §§ 1201(d),(f),(g)] . . .\ncreates civil remedies, id. § 1203, and criminal sanctions, id. § 1204. It\nspecifically authorizes a court to \"grant temporary and permanent\ninjunctions on such terms as it deems reasonable to prevent or restrain a\nviolation.\" Id. § 1203(b)(1).\n\nCorley, 273 F.3d at 440-41 (footnote appears as text in original; internal footnotes from\noriginal omitted).\nHere, as in Corley, the primary statutory clause at issue is § 1201(a)(2) of the\nDMCA, though other subsections of § 1201 are also implicated. Unlike the Second\nCircuit in Corley, which provided only enough of the statutory construction to address\nconstitutional challenges, however, we must construe the full boundaries of\nanticircumvention and anti-trafficking liability under the DMCA. We must determine the\nCongressional intent embodied in the statute's language, and then enforce the correctly\nconstrued statute to the facts at hand. See United States v. Clark, 454 U.S. 555,\n560 (1982).\nBecause the DMCA is a complex statute creating several new causes of action,\neach subject to numerous exceptions, we must also ensure that our construction makes\nsense given the statute's entirety. We must therefore consider briefly the relationship\namong the liabilities created under §§ 1201(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b). Statutory structure\nand legislative history both make it clear that § 1201 applies only to circumventions\nreasonably related to protected rights. Defendants who traffic in devices that\n04-1118\n\ncircumvent access controls in ways that facilitate infringement may be subject to liability\nunder § 1201(a)(2). Defendants who use such devices may be subject to liability under\n§ 1201(a)(1) whether they infringe or not. Because all defendants who traffic in devices\nthat circumvent rights controls necessarily facilitate infringement, they may be subject to\nliability under § 1201(b). Defendants who use such devices may be subject to liability\nfor copyright infringement. And finally, defendants whose circumvention devices do not\nfacilitate infringement are not subject to § 1201 liability.\nThe key to understanding this relationship lies in § 1201(b),12 which prohibits\ntrafficking in devices that circumvent technological measures tailored narrowly to protect\nan individual right of the copyright owner while nevertheless allowing access to the\nprotected work. Though § 1201(b) parallels the anti-trafficking ban of § 1201(a)(2),\nthere is no narrowly tailored ban on direct circumvention to parallel § 1201(a)(1). This\nomission was intentional.\nThe prohibition in 1201(a)(1) [was] necessary because prior to [the\nDMCA], the conduct of circumvention was never before made unlawful.\nThe device limitation in 1201(a)(2) enforces this new prohibition in\nconduct. The copyright law has long forbidden copyright infringements, so\nno new prohibition was necessary. The device limitation in 1201(b)\nenforces the longstanding prohibitions on infringements.\n\nS. Rep. No. 105-90 at 12 (1998).\nPrior to the DMCA, a copyright owner would have had no cause of action against\nanyone who circumvented any sort of technological control, but did not infringe. The\n\n\"No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or\notherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof,\nthat . . . [circumvents] a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a\ncopyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof.\" 35 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1)\n(emphasis added).\n04-1118\n\nDMCA rebalanced these interests to favor the copyright owner; the DMCA created\ncircumvention liability for \"digital trespass\" under § 1201(a)(1). It also created trafficking\nliability under § 1201(a)(2) for facilitating such circumvention and under § 1201(b) for\nfacilitating infringement (both subject to the numerous limitations and exceptions\noutlined throughout the DMCA).13\nThe importance of \"rebalancing\" interests in light of recent technological\nadvances is manifest in the DMCA's legislative history. Though the Supreme Court has\nrecognized that interim industrial developments may erode the \"persuasive effect of\nlegislative history,\" New York v. FERC, 535 U.S. 1, 23 (2002), Congressional intent\nevident in relatively recent legislation like the DMCA may provide useful context in\ninterpreting the statutory language. Though \"we do not resort to legislative history to\ncloud a statutory text that is clear,\" Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 147-48\n(1994), we nevertheless recognize that \"words are inexact tools at best, and hence it is\nessential that we place the words of a statute in their proper context by resort to the\nlegislative history.\" Tidewater Oil Co. v. United States, 409 U.S. 151, 157 (1972).\nThe most significant and consistent theme running through the entire legislative\nhistory of the anticircumvention and anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA, §§\n1201(a)(1),(2), is that Congress attempted to balance competing interests, and\n\"endeavored to specify, with as much clarity as possible, how the right against anti-\n\nFor obvious reasons, § 1201(a)(2) trafficking liability cannot exist in the\nabsence of § 1201(a)(1) violations--much as this court has often explained that \"indirect\n[patent] infringement, whether inducement to infringe or contributory infringement, can\nonly arise in the presence of direct infringement, though the direct infringer is typically\nsomeone other than the defendant accused of indirect infringement.\" Dynacore\nHoldings Corp. v. U.S. Philips Corp., 363 F.3d 1263, 1272 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n04-1118\n\ncircumvention would be qualified to maintain balance between the interests of content\ncreators and information users.\" H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, at 26 (1998). The Report of\nthe House Commerce Committee concluded that § 1201 \"fully respects and extends\ninto the digital environment the bedrock principle of 'balance' in American intellectual\nproperty law for the benefit of both copyright owners and users.\" Id.\nThe crux of the present dispute over statutory construction therefore stems from\na dispute over the precise balance between copyright owners and users that Congress\ncaptured in the DMCA's language.\nDefendants argue . . . that the DMCA should not be construed to reach\ntheir conduct [or product] . . . because the DMCA, so applied, could\nprevent those who wish to gain access to technologically protected\ncopyrighted works in order to make . . . non-infringing use of them from\ndoing so. . . . Technological access control measures have the capacity to\nprevent fair uses of copyrighted works as well as foul. Hence, there is a\npotential tension between the use of such access control measures and\nfair use, [as well as the much broader range of explicitly noninfringing\nuse]. . . . As the DMCA made its way through the legislative process,\nCongress was preoccupied with precisely this issue. Proponents of strong\nrestrictions on circumvention of access control measures argued that they\nwere essential if copyright holders were to make their works available in\ndigital form because digital works otherwise could be pirated too easily.\nOpponents\ncontended\nthat\nstrong\nanticircumvention\nmeasures\nwould extend the copyright monopoly inappropriately and prevent many\nfair uses of copyrighted material. Congress struck a balance. . . .\n\nReimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 304 (citations omitted). We must understand that\nbalance to resolve this dispute.\nF.\nAccess and Protection\nCongress crafted the new anticircumvention and anti-trafficking provisions here\nat issue to help bring copyright law into the information age. Advances in digital\n\n04-1118\n\ntechnology over the past few decades have stripped copyright owners of much of the\ntechnological and economic protection to which they had grown accustomed. Whereas\nlarge-scale copying and distribution of copyrighted material used to be difficult and\nexpensive, it is now easy and inexpensive. The Reimerdes court correctly noted both\nthe economic impact of these advances and their consequent potential impact on\ninnovation. Congress therefore crafted legislation restricting some, but not all,\ntechnological measures designed either to access a work protected by copyright, §\n1201(a), or to infringe a right of a copyright owner, § 1201(b).\nThough as noted, circumvention is not a new form of infringement but rather a\nnew violation prohibiting actions or products that facilitate infringement, it is significant\nthat virtually every clause of § 1201 that mentions \"access\" links \"access\" to\n\"protection.\" The import of that linkage may be less than obvious. Perhaps the best\nway to appreciate the necessity of this linkage--and the disposition of this case--is to\nconsider three interrelated questions inherent in the DMCA's structure: What does §\n1201(a)(2) prohibit above and beyond the prohibitions of § 1201(b)? What is the\nrelationship between the sorts of \"access\" prohibited under § 1201(a) and the rights\n\"protected\" under the Copyright Act? and What is the relationship between\nanticircumvention liability under § 1201(a)(1) and anti-trafficking liability under §\n1201(a)(2)? The relationships among the new liabilities that these three provisions, §§\n1201(a)(1),(a)(2),(b), create circumscribe the DMCA's scope--and therefore allow us to\ndetermine whether or not Chamberlain's claim falls within its purview. And the key to\ndisentangling these relationships lies in understanding the linkage between access and\nprotection.\n04-1118\n\nChamberlain urges us to read the DMCA as if Congress simply created a new\nprotection for copyrighted works without any reference at all either to the protections\nthat copyright owners already possess or to the rights that the Copyright Act grants to\nthe public. Chamberlain has not alleged that Skylink's Model 39 infringes its copyrights,\nnor has it alleged that the Model 39 contributes to third-party infringement of its\ncopyrights. Chamberlain's allegation is considerably more straightforward: The only\nway for the Model 39 to interoperate with a Security+ GDO is by \"accessing\"\ncopyrighted software. Skylink has therefore committed a per se violation of the DMCA.\nChamberlain urges us to conclude that no necessary connection exists between access\nand copyrights. Congress could not have intended such a broad reading of the DMCA.\nAccord Corley, 273 F.3d at 435 (explaining that Congress passed the DMCA's anti-\ntrafficking provisions to help copyright owners protect their works from piracy behind a\ndigital wall).\nChamberlain derives its strongest claimed support for its proposed construction\nfrom the trial court's opinion in Reimerdes, a case involving the same statutory\nprovision. See Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 304. Though Chamberlain is correct in\nconsidering some of the Reimerdes language supportive, it is the differences between\nthe cases, rather than their similarities, that is most instructive in demonstrating\nprecisely what the DMCA permits and what it prohibits.\n\nThe facts here differ greatly from those in Reimerdes. There, a group of movie\nstudios sought an injunction under the DMCA to prohibit illegal copying of digital\nversatile discs (DVDs). Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 308. The plaintiffs presented\nevidence that each motion picture DVD includes a content scrambling system (CSS)\n04-1118\n\nthat permits the film to be played, but not copied, using DVD players that incorporate\nthe plaintiffs' licensed decryption technology. Id. The defendant provided a link on his\nwebsite that allowed an individual to download DeCSS, a program that allows the user\nto circumvent the CSS protective system and to view or to copy a motion picture from a\nDVD, whether or not the user has a DVD player with the licensed technology. Id. The\ndefendant proudly trumpeted his actions as \"electronic civil disobedience.\" Id. at 303,\n312. The court found that the defendant had violated 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)(A)\nbecause DeCSS had only one purpose: to decrypt CSS. Id. at 319, 346.\nChamberlain's proposed construction of the DMCA ignores the significant\ndifferences between defendants whose accused products enable copying and those,\nlike Skylink, whose accused products enable only legitimate uses of copyrighted\nsoftware. Chamberlain's repeated reliance on language targeted at defendants\ntrumpeting their \"electronic civil disobedience,\" id. at 303, 312, apparently led it to\nmisconstrue significant portions of the DMCA. Many of Chamberlain's assertions in its\nbrief to this court conflate the property right of copyright with the liability that the\nanticircumvention provisions impose.\nChamberlain relies upon the DMCA's prohibition of \"fair uses . . . as well as foul,\"\nReimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 304, to argue that the enactment of the DMCA\neliminated all existing consumer expectations about the public's rights to use purchased\nproducts because those products might include technological measures controlling\naccess to a copyrighted work. But Chamberlain appears to have overlooked the\nobvious. The possibility that § 1201 might prohibit some otherwise noninfringing public\nuses of copyrighted material, see, e.g. RealNetworks, Inc. v. Streambox, Inc., No.\n04-1118\n\n2:99CV02070, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1889, at *23, (W.D. Wash., Jan. 18, 2000);\nReimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 323, arises simply because the Congressional decision\nto create liability and consequent damages for making, using, or selling a \"key\" that\nessentially enables a trespass upon intellectual property need not be identical in scope\nto the liabilities and compensable damages for infringing that property; it is, instead, a\nrebalancing of interests that \"attempt[s] to deal with special problems created by the so-\ncalled digital revolution.\" Aimster, 334 F.3d at 655.\nThough Reimerdes is not the only case that Chamberlain cites for support, none\nof its other citations are any more helpful to its cause. In three other cases, Lexmark\nInternational, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d 943, 969 (E.D.\nKy. 2003), Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. v. Gamemasters, 87 F. Supp.\n2d 976 (N.D. Cal. 1999), and RealNetworks, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1889, the trial\ncourts did grant preliminary injunctions under the DMCA using language supportive of\nChamberlain's proposed construction. None of these cases, however, is on point. In\nLexmark, 253 F. Supp. 2d at 971, the trial court ruled that the defendant's conduct\nconstituted copyright infringement. In Sony, 87 F. Supp. 2d 987, the plaintiff's\nallegations included both trademark and copyright infringement, and the defendant\nconceded that its product made \"temporary modifications\" to the plaintiff's copyrighted\ncomputer program. In RealNetworks, the defendant's product allegedly disabled\nRealNetworks' \"copy switch,\" RealNetworks' technological measure designed to let the\nowner of copyrighted material being streamed over RealNetworks' media player either\nenable or disable copying upon streaming. RealNetworks, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1889\nat *1. The court stated explicitly that the avoidance of the copy switch appeared to have\n04-1118\n\nlittle commercial value other than circumvention and the consequent infringement that it\nenabled. Id. at *21. In short, the access alleged in all three cases was intertwined with\na protected right. None of these cases can support a construction as broad as the one\nthat Chamberlain urges us to adopt, even as persuasive authority.\nFurthermore, though the severance of access from protection appears plausible\ntaken out of context, it would also introduce a number of irreconcilable problems in\nstatutory construction. The seeming plausibility arises because the statute's structure\ncould be seen to suggest that § 1201(b) strengthens a copyright owner's abilities to\nprotect its recognized rights, while § 1201(a) strengthens a copyright owner's abilities to\nprotect access to its work without regard to the legitimacy (or illegitimacy) of the actions\nthat the accused access enables. Such an interpretation is consistent with the Second\nCircuit's description: \"[T]he focus of subsection 1201(a)(2) is circumvention of\ntechnologies designed to prevent access to a work, and the focus of subsection\n1201(b)(1) is circumvention of technologies designed to permit access to a work but\nprevent copying of the work or some other act that infringes a copyright.\" Corley, 273\nF.3d at 440-41 (emphasis in original).\nIt is unlikely, however, that the Second Circuit meant to imply anything as drastic\nas wresting the concept of \"access\" from its context within the Copyright Act, as\nChamberlain would now have us do. Were § 1201(a) to allow copyright owners to use\ntechnological measures to block all access to their copyrighted works, it would\neffectively create two distinct copyright regimes. In the first regime, the owners of a\ntypical work protected by copyright would possess only the rights enumerated in 17\nU.S.C. § 106, subject to the additions, exceptions, and limitations outlined throughout\n04-1118\n\nthe rest of the Copyright Act--notably but not solely the fair use provisions of § 107.14\nOwners who feel that technology has put those rights at risk, and who incorporate\ntechnological measures to protect those rights from technological encroachment, gain\nthe additional ability to hold traffickers in circumvention devices liable under § 1201(b)\nfor putting their rights back at risk by enabling circumventors who use these devices to\ninfringe.\nUnder the second regime that Chamberlain's proposed construction implies, the\nowners of a work protected by both copyright and a technological measure that\neffectively controls access to that work per § 1201(a) would possess unlimited rights to\nhold circumventors liable under § 1201(a) merely for accessing that work, even if that\naccess enabled only rights that the Copyright Act grants to the public. This second\nimplied regime would be problematic for a number of reasons. First, as the Supreme\nCourt recently explained, \"Congress' exercise of its Copyright Clause authority must be\nrational.\" Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 205 n.10 (2003). In determining whether a\nparticular aspect of the Copyright Act \"is a rational exercise of the legislative authority\nconferred by the Copyright Clause . . . we defer substantially to Congress. It is\nCongress that has been assigned the task of defining the scope of the limited monopoly\nthat should be granted to authors . . . in order to give the public appropriate access to\n\nWe do not reach the relationship between § 107 fair use and violations of\n§ 1201. The District Court in Reimerdes rejected the DeCSS defendants' argument that\nfair use was a necessary defense to § 1201(a), Reimerdes, 111 F.Supp. 2d at 317;\nbecause any access enables some fair uses, any act of circumvention would embody its\nown defense. We leave open the question as to when § 107 might serve as an\naffirmative defense to a prima facie violation of § 1201. For the moment, we note only\nthat though the traditional fair use doctrine of § 107 remains unchanged as a defense to\ncopyright infringement under § 1201(c)(1), circumvention is not infringement.\n04-1118\n\ntheir work product.\" Id. at 204-05 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Chamberlain's\nproposed construction of § 1201(a) implies that in enacting the DMCA, Congress\nattempted to \"give the public appropriate access\" to copyrighted works by allowing\ncopyright owners to deny all access to the public. Even under the substantial deference\ndue Congress, such a redefinition borders on the irrational.\nThat apparent irrationality, however, is not the most significant problem that this\nsecond regime implies. Such a regime would be hard to reconcile with the DMCA's\nstatutory prescription that \"[n]othing in this section shall affect rights, remedies,\nlimitations, or defenses to copyright infringement, including fair use, under this title.\" 17\nU.S.C. § 1201(c)(1). A provision that prohibited access without regard to the rest of the\nCopyright Act would clearly affect rights and limitations, if not remedies and defenses.\nJustice Souter has remarked that \"[n]o canon of statutory construction familiar to me\nspecifically addresses the situation in which two simultaneously enacted provisions of\nthe same statute flatly contradict one another. We are, of course, bound to avoid such\na dilemma if we can, by glimpsing some uncontradicted meaning for each\nprovision.\" Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 509\n(1999) (Souter, J., dissenting). Chamberlain's proposed construction of § 1201(a)\nwould flatly contradict § 1201(c)(1)--a simultaneously enacted provision of the same\nstatute. We are therefore bound, if we can, to obtain an alternative construction that\nleads to no such contradiction.\nChamberlain's proposed severance of \"access\" from \"protection\" in § 1201(a)\ncreates numerous other problems. Beyond suggesting that Congress enacted by\nimplication a new, highly protective alternative regime for copyrighted works;\n04-1118\n\ncontradicting other provisions of the same statute including § 1201(c)(1); and ignoring\nthe explicit immunization of interoperability from anticircumvention liability under §\n1201(f);15 the broad policy implications of considering \"access\" in a vacuum devoid of\n\"protection\" are both absurd and disastrous. Under Chamberlain's proposed\nconstruction, explicated at oral argument, disabling a burglar alarm to gain \"access\" to a\nhome containing copyrighted books, music, art, and periodicals would violate the\nDMCA; anyone who did so would unquestionably have \"circumvent[ed] a technological\nmeasure that effectively controls access to a work protected under [the Copyright Act].\"\n§ 1201(a)(1). The appropriate deterrents to this type of behavior lie in tort law and\ncriminal law, not in copyright law. Yet, were we to read the statute's \"plain language\" as\nChamberlain urges, disabling a burglar alarm would be a per se violation of the DMCA.\nIn a similar vein, Chamberlain's proposed construction would allow any\nmanufacturer of any product to add a single copyrighted sentence or software fragment\nto its product, wrap the copyrighted material in a trivial \"encryption\" scheme, and\nthereby gain the right to restrict consumers' rights to use its products in conjunction with\ncompeting products.16 In other words, Chamberlain's construction of the DMCA would\nallow virtually any company to attempt to leverage its sales into aftermarket\nmonopolies--a practice that both the antitrust laws, see Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image\nTech. Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 455 (1992), and the doctrine of copyright misuse,\n\nAmicus CCIA expanded on this argument in its amicus briefs to both the\nDistrict Court and this court. Though the District Court found this argument at least\nsuperficially persuasive, it did not reach it. On the facts of this case, neither can we.\nBecause § 1201(f) is an affirmative defense, it becomes relevant only if Chamberlain\ncan prove a prima facie case and shift the burden of proof to Skylink.\n\n04-1118\n\nAssessment Techs. of WI, LLC v. WIREdata, Inc., 350 F.3d 640, 647 (7th Cir. 2003),\nnormally prohibit.\nEven were we to assume arguendo that the DMCA's anticircumvention\nprovisions created a new property right, Chamberlain's attempt to infer such an\nexemption from copyright misuse and antitrust liability would still be wrong. We have\nnoted numerous times that as a matter of Federal Circuit law, \"[i]ntellectual property\nrights do not confer a privilege to violate the antitrust laws. But it is also correct that the\nantitrust laws do not negate [a] patentee's right to exclude others from patent property.\"\nCSU, L.L.C. v. Xerox Corp., 203 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). In\nwhat we previously termed \"the most extensive analysis of the effect of a unilateral\nrefusal to license copyrighted expression,\" id., among our sister Circuits, the First Circuit\nexplained that: \"[T]he Copyright Act does not explicitly purport to limit the scope of the\nSherman Act. . . . [W]e must harmonize the two [Acts] as best we can.\" Data Gen.\nCorp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1186-87 (1st Cir. 1994). Our\nprevious consideration of Data General led us to conclude that it was \"consistent with\nboth the antitrust and the copyright laws and is the standard that would most likely be\nfollowed by the Tenth Circuit.\" CSU, 203 F.3d at 1329.\nBecause nothing in Seventh Circuit law contradicts Data General, we similarly\nconclude that it is the standard that the Seventh Circuit would most likely follow. The\nDMCA, as part of the Copyright Act, does not limit the scope of the antitrust laws, either\nexplicitly or implicitly. The Supreme Court\n\nAmicus CU expanded on this policy implication in its brief to this court.\n04-1118\n\nhas considered the issue of implied repeal of the antitrust laws in the\ncontext of a variety of regulatory schemes and procedures. Certain\naxioms of construction are now clearly established. Repeal of the antitrust\nlaws by implication is not favored and not casually to be allowed. Only\nwhere there is a plain repugnancy between the antitrust and regulatory\nprovisions will repeal be implied.\n\nGordon v. N.Y. Stock Exch., Inc., 422 U.S. 659, 682 (1975). No such \"plain\nrepugnancy\" separates the DMCA from the antitrust laws--unless we adopt\nChamberlain's rather extreme proposed construction of its language. The recognition\nthat the DMCA does not create a new property right drives the point home even further:\nplaintiffs alleging DMCA liability to protect their property rights are not exempt from\nother bodies of law.\nFinally, the requisite \"authorization,\" on which the District Court granted Skylink\nsummary judgment, points to yet another inconsistency in Chamberlain's proposed\nconstruction. The notion of authorization is central to understanding § 1201(a). See,\ne.g., S. Rep. 105-90 at 28 (1998) (\"Subsection (a) applies when a person has not\nobtained authorized access to a copy or a phonorecord that is protected under the\nCopyright Act and for which the copyright owner has put in place a technological\nmeasure that effectively controls access to his or her work.\"). Underlying Chamberlain's\nargument on appeal that it has not granted such authorization lies the necessary\nassumption that Chamberlain is entitled to prohibit legitimate purchasers of its\nembedded software from \"accessing\" the software by using it. Such an entitlement,\nhowever, would go far beyond the idea that the DMCA allows copyright owner to\nprohibit \"fair uses . . . as well as foul.\" Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 304.\nChamberlain's proposed construction would allow copyright owners to prohibit\nexclusively fair uses even in the absence of any feared foul use. It would therefore\n04-1118\n\nallow any copyright owner, through a combination of contractual terms and\ntechnological measures, to repeal the fair use doctrine with respect to an individual\ncopyrighted work--or even selected copies of that copyrighted work. Again, this\nimplication contradicts § 1201(c)(1) directly. Copyright law itself authorizes the public to\nmake certain uses of copyrighted materials. Consumers who purchase a product\ncontaining a copy of embedded software have the inherent legal right to use that copy\nof the software. What the law authorizes, Chamberlain cannot revoke.17\nChamberlain's proposed severance of \"access\" from \"protection\" is entirely\ninconsistent with the context defined by the total statutory structure of the Copyright Act,\nother simultaneously enacted provisions of the DMCA, and clear Congressional intent.\nSee Tidewater Oil, 409 U.S. at 157. It \"would lead to a result so bizarre that Congress\ncould not have intended it.\" Central Bank, 511 U.S. at 188. The statutory structure and\nthe legislative history both make it clear that the DMCA granted copyright holders\nadditional legal protections, but neither rescinded the basic bargain granting the public\nnoninfringing and fair uses of copyrighted materials, § 1201(c), nor prohibited various\nbeneficial uses of circumvention technology, such as those exempted under §§\n1201(d),(f),(g),(j). See Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 323.\nWe therefore reject Chamberlain's proposed construction in its entirety. We\nconclude that 17 U.S.C. § 1201 prohibits only forms of access that bear a reasonable\nrelationship to the protections that the Copyright Act otherwise affords copyright owners.\n\nIt is not clear whether a consumer who circumvents a technological\nmeasure controlling access to a copyrighted work in a manner that enables uses\npermitted under the Copyright Act but prohibited by contract can be subject to liability\n04-1118\n\nWhile such a rule of reason may create some uncertainty and consume some judicial\nresources, it is the only meaningful reading of the statute. Congress attempted to\nbalance the legitimate interests of copyright owners with those of consumers of\ncopyrighted products. See H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, at 26 (1998). The courts must\nadhere to the language that Congress enacted to determine how it attempted to achieve\nthat balance. See Gwaltney, 484 U.S. at 56.\nAs we have seen, Congress chose to create new causes of action for\ncircumvention and for trafficking in circumvention devices. Congress did not choose to\ncreate new property rights. That is the choice that we have identified. \"It is not for us to\nresolve the issues of public policy implicated by the choice we have identified. Those\nissues are for Congress.\" Corley, 273 F.3d at 458. Were we to interpret Congress's\nwords in a way that eliminated all balance and granted copyright owners carte blanche\nauthority to preclude all use, Congressional intent would remain unrealized.\nCongress chose words consistent with its stated intent to balance two sets of\nconcerns pushing in opposite directions. See H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, at 26 (1998).18\nThe statute lays out broad categories of liability and broad exemptions from liability. It\nalso instructs the courts explicitly not to construe the anticircumvention provisions in\nways that would effectively repeal longstanding principles of copyright law. See §\n1201(c).19 The courts must decide where the balance between the rights of copyright\nowners and those of the broad public tilts subject to a fact-specific rule of reason. Here,\n\nunder the DMCA. Because Chamberlain did not attempt to limit its customers' use of its\nproduct by contract, however, we do not reach this issue.\nSee also David Nimmer, A Riff on Fair Use in the Digital Millennium\nCopyright Act, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 673 (2000).\n04-1118\n\nChamberlain can point to no protected property right that Skylink imperils. The DMCA\ncannot allow Chamberlain to retract the most fundamental right that the Copyright Act\ngrants consumers: the right to use the copy of Chamberlain's embedded software that\nthey purchased.\nG.\nChamberlain's DMCA Claim\nThe proper construction of § 1201(a)(2) therefore makes it clear that\nChamberlain cannot prevail. A plaintiff alleging a violation of § 1201(a)(2) must prove:\n(1) ownership of a valid copyright on a work, (2) effectively controlled by a technological\nmeasure, which has been circumvented, (3) that third parties can now access (4)\nwithout authorization, in a manner that (5) infringes or facilitates infringing a right\nprotected by the Copyright Act, because of a product that (6) the defendant either (i)\ndesigned or produced primarily for circumvention; (ii) made available despite only\nlimited commercial significance other than circumvention; or (iii) marketed for use in\ncircumvention of the controlling technological measure. A plaintiff incapable of\nestablishing any one of elements (1) through (5) will have failed to prove a prima facie\ncase. A plaintiff capable of proving elements (1) through (5) need prove only one of\n(6)(i), (ii), or (iii) to shift the burden back to the defendant. At that point, the various\naffirmative defenses enumerated throughout § 1201 become relevant.\nThe District Court analyzed Chamberlain's allegations in precisely the\nappropriate manner--a narrow focus on Skylink's behavior, intent, and product within\nthe broader context of longstanding expectations throughout the industry. The District\nCourt assumed that Chamberlain met the first element, copyright ownership, and for the\n\nSee also Recent Cases: Copyright Law, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 1390 (2001).\n04-1118\n\npurposes of its summary judgment motions accepted Chamberlain's evidence of the\nsecond element, technological access control. The District Court granted Skylink's\nmotion for summary judgment because Chamberlain failed to meet its burden on the\nfourth element, the lack of authorization. Chamberlain emphatically contests this\nconclusion on appeal, though mostly by reiterating arguments that the District Court\ncorrectly rejected.\nChamberlain, however, has failed to show not only the requisite lack of\nauthorization, but also the necessary fifth element of its claim, the critical nexus\nbetween access and protection. Chamberlain neither alleged copyright infringement nor\nexplained how the access provided by the Model 39 transmitter facilitates the\ninfringement of any right that the Copyright Act protects. There can therefore be no\nreasonable relationship between the access that homeowners gain to Chamberlain's\ncopyrighted software when using Skylink's Model 39 transmitter and the protections that\nthe Copyright Act grants to Chamberlain. The Copyright Act authorized Chamberlain's\ncustomers to use the copy of Chamberlain's copyrighted software embedded in the\nGDOs that they purchased. Chamberlain's customers are therefore immune from §\n1201(a)(1) circumvention liability. In the absence of allegations of either copyright\ninfringement or § 1201(a)(1) circumvention, Skylink cannot be liable for § 1201(a)(2)\ntrafficking. The District Court's grant of summary judgment in Skylink's favor was\ncorrect. Chamberlain failed to allege a claim under 17 U.S.C. § 1201.\nCONCLUSION\nThe DMCA does not create a new property right for copyright owners. Nor, for\nthat matter, does it divest the public of the property rights that the Copyright Act has\n04-1118\n\nlong granted to the public. The anticircumvention and anti-trafficking provisions of the\nDMCA create new grounds of liability. A copyright owner seeking to impose liability on\nan accused circumventor must demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the\ncircumvention at issue and a use relating to a property right for which the Copyright Act\npermits the copyright owner to withhold authorization--as well as notice that\nauthorization was withheld. A copyright owner seeking to impose liability on an accused\ntrafficker must demonstrate that the trafficker's device enables either copyright\ninfringement or a prohibited circumvention. Here, the District Court correctly ruled that\nChamberlain pled no connection between unauthorized use of its copyrighted software\nand Skylink's accused transmitter. This connection is critical to sustaining a cause of\naction under the DMCA. We therefore affirm the District Court's summary judgment in\nfavor of Skylink.\nAFFIRM\nCOSTS\n\nEach party shall bear its own costs.\n04-1118"

For purposes\nof determining the royalty fee under subsection (d)(1), two or more cable systems\nin contiguous communities under common ownership or control or operating\nfrom one headend shall be considered as one system.\nThe \"local service area of a primary transmitter\", in the case of a television\nbroadcast station, comprises the area in which such station is entitled to insist\nupon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to the rules, regu\nlations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission in ef\nfect on April 15, 1976, or such station's television market as defined in section\n76.55(e) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on September 18,\n1993), or any modifications to such television market made, on or after Septem\nber 18, 1993, pursuant to section 76.55(e) or 76.59 of title 47 of the Code of Fed\neral Regulations, or in the case of a television broadcast station licensed by an ap\npropriate governmental authority of Canada or Mexico, the area in which it would\nbe entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted if it were a television\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\n§ 111\nbroadcast station subject to such rules, regulations, and authorizations. In the\ncase of a low power television station, as defined by the rules and regulations of\nthe Federal Communications Commission, the \"local service area of a primary\ntransmitter\" comprises the area within 35 miles of the transmitter site, except that\nin the case of such a station located in a standard metropolitan statistical area\nwhich has one of the 50 largest populations of all standard metropolitan statis\ntical areas (based on the 1980 decennial census of population taken by the Sec\nretary of Commerce), the number of miles shall be 20 miles. The \"local service\narea of a primary transmitter\", in the case of a radio broadcast station, comprises\nthe primary service area of such station, pursuant to the rules and regulations\nof the Federal Communications Commission.\nA \"distant signal equivalent\" is the value assigned to the secondary transmis\nsion of any nonnetwork television programming carried by a cable system in\nwhole or in part beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter of such\nprogramming. It is computed by assigning a value of one to each independent\nstation and a value of one-quarter to each network station and noncommercial\neducational station for the nonnetwork programming so carried pursuant to the\nrules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commis\nsion. The foregoing values for independent, network, and noncommercial edu\ncational stations are subject, however, to the following exceptions and limitations.\nWhere the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission\nrequire a cable system to omit the further transmission of a particular program\nand such rules and regulations also permit the substitution of another program\nembodying a performance or display of a work in place of the omitted transmis\nsion, or where such rules and regulations in effect on the date of enactment of\nthis Act permit a cable system, at its election, to effect such deletion and substi\ntution of a nonlive program or to carry additional programs not transmitted by\nprimary transmitters within whose local service area the cable system is located,\nno value shall be assigned for the substituted or additional program; where the\nrules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commis\nsion in effect on the date of enactment of this Act permit a cable system, at its\nelection, to omit the further transmission of a particular program and such rules,\nregulations, or authorizations also permit the substitution of another program\nembodying a performance or display of a work in place of the omitted transmis\nsion, the value assigned for the substituted or additional program shall be, in the\ncase of a live program, the value of one full distant signal equivalent multiplied\nby a fraction that has as its numerator the number of days in the year in which\nsuch substitution occurs and as its denominator the number of days in the year.\nIn the case of a station carried pursuant to the late-night or specialty program\nming rules of the Federal Communications Commission, or a station carried on\na part-time basis where full-time carriage is not possible because the cable system\nlacks the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis all signals\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 111\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\nwhich it is authorized to carry, the values for independent, network, and noncom\nmercial educational stations set forth above, as the case may be, shall be multi\nplied by a fraction which is equal to the ratio of the broadcast hours of such sta\ntion carried by the cable system to the total broadcast hours of the station.\nA \"network station\" is a television broadcast station that is owned or operated\nby, or affiliated with, one or more of the television networks in the United States\nproviding nationwide transmissions, and that transmits a substantial part of the\nprogramming supplied by such networks for a substantial part of that station's\ntypical broadcast day.\nAn \"independent station\" is a commercial television broadcast station other\nthan a network station.\nA \"noncommercial educational station\" is a television station that is a noncom\nmercial educational broadcast station as defined in section 397 of title 47.\n§ 112 · Limitations on exclusive rights: Ephemeral recordings44\n(a)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, and except in the case of\na motion picture or other audiovisual work, it is not an infringement of copy\nright for a transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a perfor\nmance or display of a work, under a license, including a statutory license under\nsection 114(f), or transfer of the copyright or under the limitations on exclusive\nrights in sound recordings specified by section 114 (a) or for a transmitting orga\nnization that is a broadcast radio or television station licensed as such by the Fed\neral Communications Commission and that makes a broadcast transmission of\na performance of a sound recording in a digital format on a nonsubscription basis,\nto make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission pro\ngram embodying the performance or display, if--\n(A) the copy or phonorecord is retained and used solely by the transmit\nting organization that made it, and no further copies or phonorecords are\nreproduced from it;

In establish\ning rates and terms for transmissions by eligible nonsubscription services\nand new subscription services, the copyright arbitration royalty panel shall\nestablish rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and terms that\nwould have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and\na willing seller. In determining such rates and terms, the copyright arbitra\ntion royalty panel shall base its decision on economic, competitive and pro\ngramming information presented by the parties, including--\n(i) whether use of the service may substitute for or may promote the\nsales of phonorecords or otherwise may interfere with or may enhance\nthe sound recording copyright owner's other streams of revenue from\nits sound recordings; and\n(ii) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the transmitting en\ntity in the copyrighted work and the service made available to the pub\nlic with respect to relative creative contribution, technological contribu\ntion, capital investment, cost, and risk.\nIn establishing such rates and terms, the copyright arbitration royalty\npanel may consider the rates and terms for comparable types of digital au\ndio transmission services and comparable circumstances under voluntary\nlicense agreements negotiated under subparagraph (A).\n(C)(i) Publication of a notice of the initiation of voluntary negotiation\nproceedings as specified in subparagraph (A) shall be repeated in accordance\nwith regulations that the Librarian of Congress shall prescribe--\n(I) no later than 30 days after a petition is filed by any copyright\nowners of sound recordings or any eligible nonsubscription service\nor new subscription service indicating that a new type of eligible\nnonsubscription service or new subscription service on which sound\nrecordings are performed is or is about to become operational; and\n(II) in the first week of January 2000, and at 2-year intervals there\nafter, except to the extent that different years for the repeating of such\nproceedings may be determined in accordance with subparagraph (A).\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 114\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\n(ii) The procedures specified in subparagraph (B) shall be repeated,\nin accordance with regulations that the Librarian of Congress shall pre\nscribe, upon filing of a petition in accordance with section 803(a)(1)\nduring a 60-day period commencing--\n(I) 6 months after publication of a notice of the initiation of vol\nuntary negotiation proceedings under subparagraph (A) pursuant to\na petition under clause (i)(I); or\n(II) on July 1, 2000, and at 2-year intervals thereafter, except to the\nextent that different years for the repeating of such proceedings may\nbe determined in accordance with subparagraph (A).\n(iii) The procedures specified in subparagraph (B) shall be concluded\nin accordance with section 802.\n(3) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between 1 or more\ncopyright owners of sound recordings and 1 or more entities performing sound\nrecordings shall be given effect in lieu of any determination by a copyright ar\nbitration royalty panel or decision by the Librarian of Congress.\n(4)(A) The Librarian of Congress shall also establish requirements by which\ncopyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their sound re\ncordings under this section, and under which records of such use shall be kept\nand made available by entities performing sound recordings.\n(B) Any person who wishes to perform a sound recording publicly by\nmeans of a transmission eligible for statutory licensing under this subsec\ntion may do so without infringing the exclusive right of the copyright owner\nof the sound recording--\n(i) by complying with such notice requirements as the Librarian of\nCongress shall prescribe by regulation and by paying royalty fees in ac\ncordance with this subsection; or\n(ii) if such royalty fees have not been set, by agreeing to pay such roy\nalty fees as shall be determined in accordance with this subsection.\n(C) Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before the\ntwentieth day of the month next succeeding the month in which the roy\nalty fees are set.\n(5)(A) Notwithstanding section 112(e) and the other provisions of this\nsubsection, the receiving agent may enter into agreements for the reproduc\ntion and performance of sound recordings under section 112(e) and this\nsection by any 1 or more small commercial webcasters or noncommercial\nwebcasters during the period beginning on October 28, 1998, and ending\non December 31, 2004, that, once published in the Federal Register pursu\nant to subparagraph (B), shall be binding on all copyright owners of sound\nrecordings and other persons entitled to payment under this section, in lieu\nof any determination by a copyright arbitration royalty panel or decision\nby the Librarian of Congress. Any such agreement for small commercial\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\n§ 114\nwebcasters shall include provisions for payment of royalties on the basis of\na percentage of revenue or expenses, or both, and include a minimum fee.\nAny such agreement may include other terms and conditions, including re\nquirements by which copyright owners may receive notice of the use of their\nsound recordings and under which records of such use shall be kept and\nmade available by small commercial webcasters or noncommercial webcast\ners. The receiving agent shall be under no obligation to negotiate any such\nagreement. The receiving agent shall have no obligation to any copyright\nowner of sound recordings or any other person entitled to payment under\nthis section in negotiating any such agreement, and no liability to any copy\nright owner of sound recordings or any other person entitled to payment\nunder this section for having entered into such agreement.\n(B) The Copyright Office shall cause to be published in the Federal Regis\nter any agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A). Such publica\ntion shall include a statement containing the substance of subparagraph (C).\nSuch agreements shall not be included in the Code of Federal Regulations.\nThereafter, the terms of such agreement shall be available, as an option, to any\nsmall commercial webcaster or noncommercial webcaster meeting the eligi\nbility conditions of such agreement.\n(C) Neither subparagraph (A) nor any provisions of any agreement en\ntered into pursuant to subparagraph (A), including any rate structure, fees,\nterms, conditions, or notice and recordkeeping requirements set forth\ntherein, shall be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken into account in\nany administrative, judicial, or other government proceeding involving the\nsetting or adjustment of the royalties payable for the public performance\nor reproduction in ephemeral phonorecords or copies of sound recordings,\nthe determination of terms or conditions related thereto, or the establish\nment of notice or recordkeeping requirements by the Librarian of Congress\nunder paragraph (4) or section 112(e)(4). It is the intent of Congress that any\nroyalty rates, rate structure, definitions, terms, conditions, or notice and\nrecordkeeping requirements, included in such agreements shall be consid\nered as a compromise motivated by the unique business, economic and\npolitical circumstances of small webcasters, copyright owners, and perform\ners rather than as matters that would have been negotiated in the market\nplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller, or otherwise meet the\nobjectives set forth in section 801(b).\n(D) Nothing in the Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002 or any agree\nment entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be taken into account\nby the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in\nits review of the determination by the Librarian of Congress of July 8, 2002,\nof rates and terms for the digital performance of sound recordings and ephem\neral recordings, pursuant to sections 112 and 114.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 114\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\n(E) As used in this paragraph--\n(i) the term \"noncommercial webcaster\" means a webcaster that--\n(I) is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501);\n(II) has applied in good faith to the Internal Revenue Service for ex\nemption from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code\nand has a commercially reasonable expectation that such exemption shall\nbe granted;

It is the intent of Congress that royal\nties payable to copyright owners of musical works for the public performance of\ntheir works shall not be diminished in any respect as a result of the rights granted\nby section 106(6).\n(j) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following terms have the fol\nlowing meanings:\n(l) An \"affiliated entity\" is an entity engaging in digital audio transmissions\ncovered by section 106(6), other than an interactive service, in which the licen\nsor has any direct or indirect partnership or any ownership interest amounting\nto 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting or nonvoting stock.\n(2) An \"archived program\" is a predetermined program that is available re\npeatedly on the demand of the transmission recipient and that is performed\nin the same order from the beginning, except that an archived program shall\nnot include a recorded event or broadcast transmission that makes no more\nthan an incidental use of sound recordings, as long as such recorded event or\nbroadcast transmission does not contain an entire sound recording or feature\na particular sound recording.\n(3) A \"broadcast\" transmission is a transmission made by a terrestrial broad\ncast station licensed as such by the Federal Communications Commission.\n(4) A \"continuous program\" is a predetermined program that is continu\nously performed in the same order and that is accessed at a point in the pro\ngram that is beyond the control of the transmission recipient.\n(5) A \"digital audio transmission\" is a digital transmission as defined in sec\ntion 101, that embodies the transmission of a sound recording. This term does\nnot include the transmission of any audiovisual work.\n(6) An \"eligible nonsubscription transmission\" is a noninteractive non-\nsubscription digital audio transmission not exempt under subsection (d)(1)\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\n§ 114\nthat is made as part of a service that provides audio programming consisting,\nin whole or in part, of performances of sound recordings, including retrans\nmissions of broadcast transmissions, if the primary purpose of the service is\nto provide to the public such audio or other entertainment programming, and\nthe primary purpose of the service is not to sell, advertise, or promote particu\nlar products or services other than sound recordings, live concerts, or other\nmusic-related events.\n(7) An \"interactive service\" is one that enables a member of the public to\nreceive a transmission of a program specially created for the recipient, or on\nrequest, a transmission of a particular sound recording, whether or not as part\nof a program, which is selected by or on behalf of the recipient. The ability of\nindividuals to request that particular sound recordings be performed for re\nception by the public at large, or in the case of a subscription service, by all\nsubscribers of the service, does not make a service interactive, if the program\nming on each channel of the service does not substantially consist of sound\nrecordings that are performed within 1 hour of the request or at a time desig\nnated by either the transmitting entity or the individual making such request.\nIf an entity offers both interactive and noninteractive services (either concur\nrently or at different times), the noninteractive component shall not be treated\nas part of an interactive service.\n(8) A \"new subscription service\" is a service that performs sound record\nings by means of noninteractive subscription digital audio transmissions and\nthat is not a preexisting subscription service or a preexisting satellite digital\naudio radio service.\n(9) A \"nonsubscription\" transmission is any transmission that is not a sub\nscription transmission.\n(10) A \"preexisting satellite digital audio radio service\" is a subscription sat\nellite digital audio radio service provided pursuant to a satellite digital audio\nradio service license issued by the Federal Communications Commission on\nor before July 31, 1998, and any renewal of such license to the extent of the scope\nof the original license, and may include a limited number of sample channels\nrepresentative of the subscription service that are made available on a non-\nsubscription basis in order to promote the subscription service.\n(11) A \"preexisting subscription service\" is a service that performs sound\nrecordings by means of noninteractive audio-only subscription digital au\ndio transmissions, which was in existence and was making such transmis\nsions to the public for a fee on or before July 31, 1998, and may include a\nlimited number of sample channels representative of the subscription ser\nvice that are made available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote\nthe subscription service.\n(12) A \"retransmission\" is a further transmission of an initial transmission,\nand includes any further retransmission of the same transmission. Except as\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 114\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\nprovided in this section, a transmission qualifies as a \"retransmission\" only if\nit is simultaneous with the initial transmission. Nothing in this definition shall\nbe construed to exempt a transmission that fails to satisfy a separate element\nrequired to qualify for an exemption under section 114(d)(1).\n(13) The \"sound recording performance complement\" is the transmission\nduring any 3-hour period, on a particular channel used by a transmitting en\ntity, of no more than--\n(A) 3 different selections of sound recordings from any one phonorecord\nlawfully distributed for public performance or sale in the United States, if\nno more than 2 such selections are transmitted consecutively; or\n(B) 4 different selections of sound recordings--\n(i) by the same featured recording artist; or\n(ii) from any set or compilation of phonorecords lawfully distributed\ntogether as a unit for public performance or sale in the United States,\nif no more than three such selections are transmitted consecutively:\nProvided, That the transmission of selections in excess of the numerical\nlimits provided for in clauses (A) and (B) from multiple phonorecords shall\nnonetheless qualify as a sound recording performance complement if the\nprogramming of the multiple phonorecords was not willfully intended to\navoid the numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses.\n(14) A \"subscription\" transmission is a transmission that is controlled and\nlimited to particular recipients, and for which consideration is required to be\npaid or otherwise given by or on behalf of the recipient to receive the trans\nmission or a package of transmissions including the transmission.\n(15) A \"transmission\" is either an initial transmission or a retransmission.\n§ 115 · Scope of exclusive rights in nondramatic musical works:\nCompulsory license for making and distributing phonorecords49\nIn the case of nondramatic musical works, the exclusive rights provided by clauses\n(1) and (3) of section 106, to make and to distribute phonorecords of such works,\nare subject to compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by this section.\n(a) Availability and Scope of Compulsory License.--\n(1) When phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been distrib\nuted to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright\nowner, any other person, including those who make phonorecords or digital\nphonorecord deliveries, may, by complying with the provisions of this section,\nobtain a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of the work.\nA person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary purpose\nin making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private use, in\ncluding by means of a digital phonorecord delivery. A person may not obtain\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\n§ 115\na compulsory license for use of the work in the making of phonorecords du\nplicating a sound recording fixed by another, unless:\n(i) such sound recording was fixed lawfully; and\n(ii) the making of the phonorecords was authorized by the owner of\ncopyright in the sound recording or, if the sound recording was fixed\nbefore February 15, 1972, by any person who fixed the sound recording\npursuant to an express license from the owner of the copyright in the\nmusical work or pursuant to a valid compulsory license for use of such\nwork in a sound recording.\n(2) A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a musical arrange\nment of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner\nof interpretation of the performance involved, but the arrangement shall not\nchange the basic melody or fundamental character of the work, and shall not\nbe subject to protection as a derivative work under this title, except with the\nexpress consent of the copyright owner.\n(b) Notice of Intention to Obtain Compulsory License.--\n(1) Any person who wishes to obtain a compulsory license under this sec\ntion shall, before or within thirty days after making, and before distributing\nany phonorecords of the work, serve notice of intention to do so on the copy\nright owner. If the registration or other public records of the Copyright\nOffice do not identify the copyright owner and include an address at which\nnotice can be served, it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention in\nthe Copyright Office. The notice shall comply, in form, content, and man\nner of service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall pre\nscribe by regulation.\n(2) Failure to serve or file the notice required by clause (1) forecloses the pos\nsibility of a compulsory license and, in the absence of a negotiated license, ren\nders the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of in\nfringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by\nsections 502 through 506 and 509.\n(c) Royalty Payable under Compulsory License.50--\n(1) To be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory license, the copy\nright owner must be identified in the registration or other public records of\nthe Copyright Office. The owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords made\nand distributed after being so identified, but is not entitled to recover for any\nphonorecords previously made and distributed.\n(2) Except as provided by clause (1), the royalty under a compulsory license\nshall be payable for every phonorecord made and distributed in accordance\nwith the license. For this purpose, and other than as provided in paragraph\n(3), a phonorecord is considered \"distributed\" if the person exercising the\ncompulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its possession.\nWith respect to each work embodied in the phonorecord, the royalty shall be\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 115\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\neither two and three-fourths cents, or one-half of one cent per minute of\nplaying time or fraction thereof, whichever amount is larger.51\n(3)(A) A compulsory license under this section includes the right of the\ncompulsory licensee to distribute or authorize the distribution of a phonore\ncord of a nondramatic musical work by means of a digital transmission which\nconstitutes a digital phonorecord delivery, regardless of whether the digital\ntransmission is also a public performance of the sound recording under sec\ntion 106(6) of this title or of any nondramatic musical work embodied therein\nunder section 106(4) of this title. For every digital phonorecord delivery by or\nunder the authority of the compulsory licensee--\n(i) on or before December 31, 1997, the royalty payable by the com\npulsory licensee shall be the royalty prescribed under paragraph (2) and\nchapter 8 of this title; and\n(ii) on or after January 1, 1998, the royalty payable by the compulsory\nlicensee shall be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs (B) through\n(F) and chapter 8 of this title.\n(B) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any copyright\nowners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain\na compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) may negotiate and agree upon\nthe terms and rates of royalty payments under this paragraph and the pro\nportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may desig\nnate common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay or receive such royalty pay\nments. Such authority to negotiate the terms and rates of royalty payments\nincludes, but is not limited to, the authority to negotiate the year during\nwhich the royalty rates prescribed under subparagraphs (B) through (F) and\nchapter 8 of this title shall next be determined.\n(C) During the period of June 30, 1996, through December 31, 1996, the\nLibrarian of Congress shall cause notice to be published in the Federal Reg\nister of the initiation of voluntary negotiation proceedings for the purpose\nof determining reasonable terms and rates of royalty payments for the ac\ntivities specified by subparagraph (A) during the period beginning Janu\nary 1, 1998, and ending on the effective date of any new terms and rates\nestablished pursuant to subparagraph (C), (D) or (F), or such other date\n(regarding digital phonorecord deliveries) as the parties may agree. Such\nterms and rates shall distinguish between (i) digital phonorecord deliver\nies where the reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental\nto the transmission which constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery, and\n(ii) digital phonorecord deliveries in general. Any copyright owners of\nnondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a com\npulsory license under subsection (a)(1) may submit to the Librarian of\nCongress licenses covering such activities. The parties to each negotia\ntion proceeding shall bear their own costs.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nSubject Matter and Scope of Copyright\n§ 115\n(D) In the absence of license agreements negotiated under subpara\ngraphs (B) and (C), upon the filing of a petition in accordance with sec\ntion 803(a)(1), the Librarian of Congress shall, pursuant to chapter 8, con\nvene a copyright arbitration royalty panel to determine a schedule of rates\nand terms which, subject to subparagraph (E), shall be binding on all copy\nright owners of nondramatic musical works and persons entitled to ob\ntain a compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) during the period be\nginning January 1, 1998, and ending on the effective date of any new terms\nand rates established pursuant to subparagraph (C), (D) or (F), or such\nother date (regarding digital phonorecord deliveries) as may be determined\npursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C). Such terms and rates shall distin\nguish between (i) digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction or\ndistribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the transmission which con\nstitutes the digital phonorecord delivery, and (ii) digital phonorecord de\nliveries in general. In addition to the objectives set forth in section 801(b)(1),\nin establishing such rates and terms, the copyright arbitration royalty panel\nmay consider rates and terms under voluntary license agreements negoti\nated as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C). The royalty rates payable for\na compulsory license for a digital phonorecord delivery under this section\nshall be established de novo and no precedential effect shall be given to the\namount of the royalty payable by a compulsory licensee for digital phono\nrecord deliveries on or before December 31, 1997. The Librarian of Con\ngress shall also establish requirements by which copyright owners may re\nceive reasonable notice of the use of their works under this section, and\nunder which records of such use shall be kept and made available by per\nsons making digital phonorecord deliveries.\n(E)(i) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between\none or more copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and one or\nmore persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection\n(a)(1) shall be given effect in lieu of any determination by the Librarian of\nCongress.

The authors of a joint work are co\nowner of copyright in the work.\n(b) Works Made for Hire.--In the case of a work made for hire, the employer\nor other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author for pur\nposes of this title, and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a writ\nten instrument signed by them, owns all of the rights comprised in the copyright.\n(c) Contributions to Collective Works.--Copyright in each separate con\ntribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a\nwhole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an ex\npress transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in\nthe collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing\nand distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any re\nvision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.\n(d) Transfer of Ownership.--\n(1) The ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by\nany means of conveyance or by operation of law, and may be bequeathed by\nwill or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession.\n(2) Any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, including any sub\ndivision of any of the rights specified by section 106, may be transferred as pro\nvided by clause (1) and owned separately.

In the case\nof a grant executed by two or more authors of a joint work, termination of the\ngrant may be effected by a majority of the authors who executed it; if any of\nsuch authors is dead, the termination interest of any such author may be ex\nercised as a unit by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this sub\nsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than one-half of that\nauthor's interest.\n(2) Where an author is dead, his or her termination interest is owned, and\nmay be exercised, as follows:\n(A) The widow or widower owns the author's entire termination inter\nest unless there are any surviving children or grandchildren of the author,\nin which case the widow or widower owns one-half of the author's interest.\n(B) The author's surviving children, and the surviving children of any\ndead child of the author, own the author's entire termination interest un\nless there is a widow or widower, in which case the ownership of one-half\nof the author's interest is divided among them.\n(C) The rights of the author's children and grandchildren are in all cases\ndivided among them and exercised on a per stirpes basis according to the\nnumber of such author's children represented; the share of the children of\na dead child in a termination interest can be exercised only by the action\nof a majority of them.\n(D) In the event that the author's widow or widower, children, and grand\nchildren are not living, the author's executor, administrator, personal repre\nsentative, or trustee shall own the author's entire termination interest.\n(3) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period\nof five years beginning at the end of thirty-five years from the date of execu\ntion of the grant; or, if the grant covers the right of publication of the work,\nthe period begins at the end of thirty-five years from the date of publication\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 203\nCopyright Ownership and Transfer\nof the work under the grant or at the end of forty years from the date of ex\necution of the grant, whichever term ends earlier.\n(4) The termination shall be effected by serving an advance notice in writ\ning, signed by the number and proportion of owners of termination interests\nrequired under clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection, or by their duly autho\nrized agents, upon the grantee or the grantee's successor in title.\n(A) The notice shall state the effective date of the termination, which shall\nfall within the five-year period specified by clause (3) of this subsection, and\nthe notice shall be served not less than two or more than ten years before\nthat date.

The rights vest in the author, authors, and other\npersons named in, and in the proportionate shares provided by, clauses (1) and\n(2) of subsection (a).\n(3) Subject to the provisions of clause (4) of this subsection, a further\ngrant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right covered by a ter\nminated grant is valid only if it is signed by the same number and propor\ntion of the owners, in whom the right has vested under clause (2) of this\nsubsection, as are required to terminate the grant under clauses (1) and (2)\nof subsection (a). Such further grant or agreement is effective with respect\nto all of the persons in whom the right it covers has vested under clause (2)\nof this subsection, including those who did not join in signing it. If any\nperson dies after rights under a terminated grant have vested in him or her,\nthat person's legal representatives, legatees, or heirs at law represent him or\nher for purposes of this clause.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nCopyright Ownership and Transfer\n§ 205\n(4) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right\ncovered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective\ndate of the termination. As an exception, however, an agreement for such a\nfurther grant may be made between the persons provided by clause (3) of\nthis subsection and the original grantee or such grantee's successor in title,\nafter the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause (4) of\nsubsection (a).\n(5) Termination of a grant under this section affects only those rights cov\nered by the grants that arise under this title, and in no way affects rights aris\ning under any other Federal, State, or foreign laws.\n(6) Unless and until termination is effected under this section, the grant, if\nit does not provide otherwise, continues in effect for the term of copyright pro\nvided by this title.\n§ 204 · Execution of transfers of copyright ownership\n(a) A transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is not\nvalid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the trans\nfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner's\nduly authorized agent.\n(b) A certificate of acknowledgment is not required for the validity of a trans\nfer, but is prima facie evidence of the execution of the transfer if--\n(1) in the case of a transfer executed in the United States, the certificate is is\nsued by a person authorized to administer oaths within the United States; or\n(2) in the case of a transfer executed in a foreign country, the certificate is\nissued by a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States, or by a person\nauthorized to administer oaths whose authority is proved by a certificate of\nsuch an officer.\n§ 205 · Recordation of transfers and other documents4\n(a) Conditions for Recordation.--Any transfer of copyright ownership or\nother document pertaining to a copyright may be recorded in the Copyright\nOffice if the document filed for recordation bears the actual signature of the per\nson who executed it, or if it is accompanied by a sworn or official certification\nthat it is a true copy of the original, signed document.\n(b) Certificate of Recordation.--The Register of Copyrights shall,\nupon receipt of a document as provided by subsection (a) and of the fee pro\nvided by section 708, record the document and return it with a certificate of\nrecordation.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 205\nCopyright Ownership and Transfer\n(c) Recordation as Constructive Notice.--Recordation of a document\nin the Copyright Office gives all persons constructive notice of the facts stated\nin the recorded document, but only if--\n(1) the document, or material attached to it, specifically identifies the work\nto which it pertains so that, after the document is indexed by the Register of\nCopyrights, it would be revealed by a reasonable search under the title or reg\nistration number of the work; and\n(2) registration has been made for the work.\n(d) Priority between Conflicting Transfers.--As between two conflic\nting transfers, the one executed first prevails if it is recorded, in the manner re\nquired to give constructive notice under subsection (c), within one month after\nits execution in the United States or within two months after its execution out\nside the United States, or at any time before recordation in such manner of the\nlater transfer. Otherwise the later transfer prevails if recorded first in such man\nner, and if taken in good faith, for valuable consideration or on the basis of a bind\ning promise to pay royalties, and without notice of the earlier transfer.\n(e) Priority between Conflicting Transfer of Ownership and Non\nexclusive License.--A nonexclusive license, whether recorded or not, prevails\nover a conflicting transfer of copyright ownership if the license is evidenced by\na written instrument signed by the owner of the rights licensed or such owner's\nduly authorized agent, and if\n(1) the license was taken before execution of the transfer; or\n(2) the license was taken in good faith before recordation of the transfer\nand without notice of it.\nChapter 2 · Endnotes\n1.

In all cases the reversion of rights is sub\nject to the following limitations:\n(A) A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its\ntermination may continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant after\nits termination, but this privilege does not extend to the preparation after\nthe termination of other derivative works based upon the copyrighted work\ncovered by the terminated grant.\n(B) The future rights that will revert upon termination of the grant be\ncome vested on the date the notice of termination has been served as pro\nvided by clause (4) of this subsection.\n(C) Where the author's rights revert to two or more persons under clause\n(2) of this subsection, they shall vest in those persons in the proportionate\nshares provided by that clause. In such a case, and subject to the provisions\nof subclause (D) of this clause, a further grant, or agreement to make a fur\nther grant, of a particular author's share with respect to any right covered\nby a terminated grant is valid only if it is signed by the same number and\nproportion of the owners, in whom the right has vested under this clause,\nas are required to terminate the grant under clause (2) of this subsection.\nSuch further grant or agreement is effective with respect to all of the per\nsons in whom the right it covers has vested under this subclause, includ\ning those who did not join in signing it. If any person dies after rights under\na terminated grant have vested in him or her, that person's legal represen\ntatives, legatees, or heirs at law represent him or her for purposes of this\nsubclause.\n(D) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right\ncovered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective\ndate of the termination. As an exception, however, an agreement for such\na further grant may be made between the author or any of the persons\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nDuration of Copyright\nEndnotes\nprovided by the first sentence of clause (6) of this subsection, or between\nthe persons provided by subclause (C) of this clause, and the original grantee\nor such grantee's successor in title, after the notice of termination has been\nserved as provided by clause (4) of this subsection.\n(E) Termination of a grant under this subsection affects only those rights\ncovered by the grant that arise under this title, and in no way affects rights\narising under any other Federal, State, or foreign laws.\n(F) Unless and until termination is effected under this subsection, the\ngrant, if it does not provide otherwise, continues in effect for the remain\nder of the extended renewal term.\n(d) Termination Rights Provided in Subsection (c) Which Have Ex\npired on or before the Effective Date of the Sonny Bono Copyright\nTerm Extension Act.--In the case of any copyright other than a work made for\nhire, subsisting in its renewal term on the effective date of the Sonny Bono Copy\nright Term Extension Act9 for which the termination right provided in subsec\ntion (c) has expired by such date, where the author or owner of the termination\nright has not previously exercised such termination right, the exclusive or non\nexclusive grant of a transfer or license of the renewal copyright or any right un\nder it, executed before January 1, 1978, by any of the persons designated in sub\nsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, other than by will, is subject to termination under\nthe following conditions:\n(1) The conditions specified in subsections (c) (1), (2), (4), (5), and (6) of\nthis section apply to terminations of the last 20 years of copyright term as\nprovided by the amendments made by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Ex\ntension Act.\n(2) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period\nof 5 years beginning at the end of 75 years from the date copyright was origi\nnally secured.\n§ 305 · Duration of copyright: Terminal date\nAll terms of copyright provided by sections 302 through 304 run to the end of\nthe calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.\nChapter 3 · Endnotes\n1.

In 1998, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act amended section 302 by sub\nstituting \"70\" for \"fifty,\" \"95\" for \"seventy-five\" and \"120\" for \"one hundred\" each place they\nappeared. Pub. L. No. 105-298, 112 Stat. 2827. This change was effective October 27, 1998. Id.\n5. In 1997, section 303 was amended by adding subsection (b). Pub. L. No. 105-80, 111 Stat.\n1529, 1534.

Pub. L. No. 105-298, 112 Stat. 2827. That\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nDuration of Copyright\nEndnotes\nAct also amended subsection 304(c) by deleting \"by his widow or her widower and his or her\nchildren or grandchildren\" from the first sentence of paragraph (2), by adding subparagraph\n(D) at the end of paragraph (2) and by inserting \"or, in the case of a termination under sub\nsection (d), within the five-year period specified by subsection (d)(2),\" into the first sentence\nof subparagraph (4)(A). Id.\n7. In 1998, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act amendment to subsection\n304(b) completely deleted the previous language that was originally part of the 1976 Copy\nright Act. Pub. L. No. 105-298, 112 Stat. 2827. That earlier statutory language continues to be\nrelevant for calculating the term of protection for copyrights commencing between Septem\nber 19, 1906, and December 31, 1949. The 1976 Copyright Act extended the terms for those\ncopyrights by 20 years, provided they were in their renewal term between December 31, 1976,\nand December 31, 1977. The deleted language states:\nThe duration of any copyright, the renewal term of which is subsisting at any time\nbetween December 31, 1976, and December 31, 1977, inclusive, or for which renewal\nregistration is made between December 31, 1976, and December 31, 1977, inclusive, is\nextended to endure for a term of seventy-five years from the date copyright was origi\nnally secured.\nThe effective date of this provision was October 19, 1976.

No. 94-553, 90\nStat. 2541, 2598.\nIn addition, prior to the 1976 Copyright Act, Congress enacted a series of nine interim\nextensions for works whose copyright protection began between September 19, 1906, and\nDecember 31, 1918, if they were in their renewal terms. Without these interim extensions,\ncopyrights commencing during that time period would have otherwise expired after 56 years,\nat the end of their renewal terms, between September 19, 1962, and December 31, 1976. The\nnine Acts authorizing the interim extensions are as follows, in chronological order:\nPub. L. No. 87-668, 76 Stat. 555 (extending copyrights from September 19, 1962, to\nDecember 31, 1965)\nPub.

The year\ndate may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with ac\ncompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards,\nstationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and\n(3) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by\nwhich the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designa\ntion of the owner.\n(c) Position of Notice.--The notice shall be affixed to the copies in such\nmanner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright.\nThe Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific\nmethods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of works\nthat will satisfy this requirement, but these specifications shall not be consid\nered exhaustive.\n(d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.--If a notice of copyright in the form\nand position specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to\nwhich a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight\nshall be given to such a defendant's interposition of a defense based on innocent\ninfringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in\nthe last sentence of section 504(c)(2).\n§ 402 · Notice of copyright: Phonorecords of sound recordings2\n(a) General Provisions.--Whenever a sound recording protected under this\ntitle is published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright\nowner, a notice of copyright as provided by this section may be placed on pub\nlicly distributed phonorecords of the sound recording.\n(b) Form of Notice.--If a notice appears on the phonorecords, it shall con\nsist of the following three elements:\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nCopyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration\n§ 404\n(1) the symbol π (the letter P in a circle); and\n(2) the year of first publication of the sound recording; and\n(3) the name of the owner of copyright in the sound recording, or an ab\nbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known al\nternative designation of the owner; if the producer of the sound recording\nis named on the phonorecord labels or containers, and if no other name ap\npears in conjunction with the notice, the producer's name shall be consid\nered a part of the notice.\n(c) Position of Notice.--The notice shall be placed on the surface of the\nphonorecord, or on the phonorecord label or container, in such manner and lo\ncation as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright.\n(d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.--If a notice of copyright in the form\nand position specified by this section appears on the published phonorecord or\nphonorecords to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access,\nthen no weight shall be given to such a defendant's interposition of a defense based\non innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except\nas provided in the last sentence of section 504(c)(2).\n§ 403 · Notice of copyright: Publications incorporating\nUnited States Government works3\nSections 401(d) and 402(d) shall not apply to a work published in copies or phon\norecords consisting predominantly of one or more works of the United States\nGovernment unless the notice of copyright appearing on the published copies or\nphonorecords to which a defendant in the copyright infringement suit had ac\ncess includes a statement identifying, either affirmatively or negatively, those\nportions of the copies or phonorecords embodying any work or works protected\nunder this title.\n§ 404 · Notice of copyright: Contributions to collective works4\n(a) A separate contribution to a collective work may bear its own notice of copy\nright, as provided by sections 401 through 403. However, a single notice applicable\nto the collective work as a whole is sufficient to invoke the provisions of section\n401(d) or 402(d), as applicable with respect to the separate contributions it con\ntains (not including advertisements inserted on behalf of persons other than the\nowner of copyright in the collective work), regardless of the ownership of copy\nright in the contributions and whether or not they have been previously published.\n(b) With respect to copies and phonorecords publicly distributed by author\nity of the copyright owner before the effective date of the Berne Convention\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 404\nCopyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration\nImplementation Act of 1988, where the person named in a single notice appli\ncable to a collective work as a whole is not the owner of copyright in a separate\ncontribution that does not bear its own notice, the case is governed by the provi\nsions of section 406(a).\n§ 405 · Notice of copyright: Omission of notice on\ncertain copies and phonorecords5\n(a) Effect of Omission on Copyright.--With respect to copies and pho\nnorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner before the ef\nfective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, the omission\nof the copyright notice described in sections 401 through 403 from copies or pho\nnorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner does not in\nvalidate the copyright in a work if--\n(1) the notice has been omitted from no more than a relatively small num\nber of copies or phonorecords distributed to the public; or\n(2) registration for the work has been made before or is made within five\nyears after the publication without notice, and a reasonable effort is made to\nadd notice to all copies or phonorecords that are distributed to the public in\nthe United States after the omission has been discovered; or\n(3) the notice has been omitted in violation of an express requirement in\nwriting that, as a condition of the copyright owner's authorization of the public\ndistribution of copies or phonorecords, they bear the prescribed notice.\n(b) Effect of Omission on Innocent Infringers.--Any person who inno\ncently infringes a copyright, in reliance upon an authorized copy or phonorecord\nfrom which the copyright notice has been omitted and which was publicly distrib\nuted by authority of the copyright owner before the effective date of the Berne\nConvention Implementation Act of 1988, incurs no liability for actual or statutory\ndamages under section 504 for any infringing acts committed before receiving ac\ntual notice that registration for the work has been made under section 408, if such\nperson proves that he or she was misled by the omission of notice. In a suit for in\nfringement in such a case the court may allow or disallow recovery of any of the\ninfringer's profits attributable to the infringement, and may enjoin the continua\ntion of the infringing undertaking or may require, as a condition for permitting the\ncontinuation of the infringing undertaking, that the infringer pay the copyright\nowner a reasonable license fee in an amount and on terms fixed by the court.\n(c) Removal of Notice.--Protection under this title is not affected by the re\nmoval, destruction, or obliteration of the notice, without the authorization of the\ncopyright owner, from any publicly distributed copies or phonorecords.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nCopyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration\n§ 407\n§ 406 · Notice of copyright: Error in name or date on\ncertain copies and phonorecords6\n(a) Error in Name.--With respect to copies and phonorecords publicly dis\ntributed by authority of the copyright owner before the effective date of the Berne\nConvention Implementation Act of 1988, where the person named in the copy\nright notice on copies or phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the\ncopyright owner is not the owner of copyright, the validity and ownership of the\ncopyright are not affected. In such a case, however, any person who innocently\nbegins an undertaking that infringes the copyright has a complete defense to\nany action for such infringement if such person proves that he or she was mis\nled by the notice and began the undertaking in good faith under a purported\ntransfer or license from the person named therein, unless before the undertak\ning was begun--\n(1) registration for the work had been made in the name of the owner of\ncopyright; or\n(2) a document executed by the person named in the notice and showing\nthe ownership of the copyright had been recorded.\nThe person named in the notice is liable to account to the copyright owner\nfor all receipts from transfers or licenses purportedly made under the copyright\nby the person named in the notice.\n(b) Error in Date.--When the year date in the notice on copies or phono\nrecords distributed before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implemen\ntation Act of 1988 by authority of the copyright owner is earlier than the year in\nwhich publication first occurred, any period computed from the year of first\npublication under section 302 is to be computed from the year in the notice.\nWhere the year date is more than one year later than the year in which publica\ntion first occurred, the work is considered to have been published without any\nnotice and is governed by the provisions of section 405.\n(c) Omission of Name or Date.--Where copies or phonorecords publicly dis\ntributed before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of\n1988 by authority of the copyright owner contain no name or no date that could\nreasonably be considered a part of the notice, the work is considered to have been\npublished without any notice and is governed by the provisions of section 405 as in\neffect on the day before the effective date of the Berne Convention Implementation\nAct of 1988.\n§ 407 · Deposit of copies or phonorecords for Library of Congress7\n(a) Except as provided by subsection (c), and subject to the provisions of sub\nsection (e), the owner of copyright or of the exclusive right of publication in a\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 407\nCopyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration\nwork published in the United States shall deposit, within three months after the\ndate of such publication--\n(1) two complete copies of the best edition; or\n(2) if the work is a sound recording, two complete phonorecords of the best\nedition, together with any printed or other visually perceptible material pub\nlished with such phonorecords.\nNeither the deposit requirements of this subsection nor the acquisition pro\nvisions of subsection (e) are conditions of copyright protection.\n(b) The required copies or phonorecords shall be deposited in the Copyright\nOffice for the use or disposition of the Library of Congress. The Register of\nCopyrights shall, when requested by the depositor and upon payment of the fee\nprescribed by section 708, issue a receipt for the deposit.\n(c) The Register of Copyrights may by regulation exempt any categories of ma\nterial from the deposit requirements of this section, or require deposit of only one\ncopy or phonorecord with respect to any categories. Such regulations shall pro\nvide either for complete exemption from the deposit requirements of this section,\nor for alternative forms of deposit aimed at providing a satisfactory archival record\nof a work without imposing practical or financial hardships on the depositor,\nwhere the individual author is the owner of copyright in a pictorial, graphic, or\nsculptural work and (i) less than five copies of the work have been published, or\n(ii) the work has been published in a limited edition consisting of numbered\ncopies, the monetary value of which would make the mandatory deposit of two\ncopies of the best edition of the work burdensome, unfair, or unreasonable.\n(d) At any time after publication of a work as provided by subsection (a), the\nRegister of Copyrights may make written demand for the required deposit on any\nof the persons obligated to make the deposit under subsection (a). Unless deposit\nis made within three months after the demand is received, the person or persons\non whom the demand was made are liable--\n(1) to a fine of not more than $250 for each work; and\n(2) to pay into a specially designated fund in the Library of Congress the\ntotal retail price of the copies or phonorecords demanded, or, if no retail price\nhas been fixed, the reasonable cost to the Library of Congress of acquiring\nthem; and\n(3) to pay a fine of $2,500, in addition to any fine or liability imposed un\nder clauses (1) and (2), if such person willfully or repeatedly fails or refuses to\ncomply with such a demand.\n(e) With respect to transmission programs that have been fixed and transmit\nted to the public in the United States but have not been published, the Register\nof Copyrights shall, after consulting with the Librarian of Congress and other in\nterested organizations and officials, establish regulations governing the acquisi\ntion, through deposit or otherwise, of copies or phonorecords of such programs\nfor the collections of the Library of Congress.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nCopyright Notice, Deposit, and Registration\n§ 408\n(1) The Librarian of Congress shall be permitted, under the standards and\nconditions set forth in such regulations, to make a fixation of a transmission\nprogram directly from a transmission to the public, and to reproduce one copy\nor phonorecord from such fixation for archival purposes.\n(2) Such regulations shall also provide standards and procedures by which\nthe Register of Copyrights may make written demand, upon the owner of the\nright of transmission in the United States, for the deposit of a copy or phono\nrecord of a specific transmission program. Such deposit may, at the option of\nthe owner of the right of transmission in the United States, be accomplished\nby gift, by loan for purposes of reproduction, or by sale at a price not to ex\nceed the cost of reproducing and supplying the copy or phonorecord.

and\n(D) whether other less burdensome and comparably effective means of\npreventing or restraining access to the infringing material are available.\n(3) Notice and ex parte orders.--Injunctive relief under this subsection\nshall be available only after notice to the service provider and an opportunity\nfor the service provider to appear are provided, except for orders ensuring the\npreservation of evidence or other orders having no material adverse effect on\nthe operation of the service provider's communications network.\n(k) Definitions.--\n(1) Service provider.--(A) As used in subsection (a), the term \"service pro\nvider\" means an entity offering the transmission, routing, or providing of con\nnections for digital online communications, between or among points speci\nfied by a user, of material of the user's choosing, without modification to the\ncontent of the material as sent or received.\n(B) As used in this section, other than subsection (a), the term \"ser\nvice provider\" means a provider of online services or network access, or\nthe operator of facilities therefor, and includes an entity described in sub\nparagraph (A).\n(2) Monetary relief.--As used in this section, the term \"monetary re\nlief \" means damages, costs, attorneys' fees, and any other form of monetary\npayment.\n(l) Other Defenses Not Affected.--The failure of a service provider's con\nduct to qualify for limitation of liability under this section shall not bear adversely\nupon the consideration of a defense by the service provider that the service pro\nvider's conduct is not infringing under this title or any other defense.\n(m) Protection of Privacy.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to\ncondition the applicability of subsections (a) through (d) on--\n(1) a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts\nindicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with a standard\ntechnical measure complying with the provisions of subsection (i); or\n(2) a service provider gaining access to, removing, or disabling access to ma\nterial in cases in which such conduct is prohibited by law.\n(n) Construction.--Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) describe separate and\ndistinct functions for purposes of applying this section. Whether a service pro\nvider qualifies for the limitation on liability in any one of those subsections shall\nbe based solely on the criteria in that subsection, and shall not affect a determi\nnation of whether that service provider qualifies for the limitations on liability\nunder any other such subsection.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 513\nCopyright Infringement and Remedies\n§ 513 · Determination of reasonable license fees\nfor individual proprietors10\nIn the case of any performing rights society subject to a consent decree which pro\nvides for the determination of reasonable license rates or fees to be charged by\nthe performing rights society, notwithstanding the provisions of that consent de\ncree, an individual proprietor who owns or operates fewer than 7 nonpublicly\ntraded establishments in which nondramatic musical works are performed pub\nlicly and who claims that any license agreement offered by that performing rights\nsociety is unreasonable in its license rate or fee as to that individual proprietor,\nshall be entitled to determination of a reasonable license rate or fee as follows:\n(1) The individual proprietor may commence such proceeding for deter\nmination of a reasonable license rate or fee by filing an application in the ap\nplicable district court under paragraph (2) that a rate disagreement exists and\nby serving a copy of the application on the performing rights society.

Such proceeding, including such review, shall be concluded\nwithin 6 months after its commencement.\n(7) Any such final determination shall be binding only as to the individual\nproprietor commencing the proceeding, and shall not be applicable to any\nother proprietor or any other performing rights society, and the performing\nrights society shall be relieved of any obligation of nondiscrimination among\nsimilarly situated music users that may be imposed by the consent decree gov\nerning its operations.\n(8) An individual proprietor may not bring more than one proceeding pro\nvided for in this section for the determination of a reasonable license rate or fee\nunder any license agreement with respect to any one performing rights society.\n(9) For purposes of this section, the term \"industry rate\" means the license\nfee a performing rights society has agreed to with, or which has been deter\nmined by the court for, a significant segment of the music user industry to\nwhich the individual proprietor belongs.\nChapter 5 · Endnotes\n1.

The rates applicable under sections 114(f)(1)(B),\n115, and 116 shall be calculated to achieve the following objectives:\n(A) To maximize the availability of creative works to the public;\n(B) To afford the copyright owner a fair return for his creative work\nand the copyright user a fair income under existing economic conditions;\n(C) To reflect the relative roles of the copyright owner and the copy\nright user in the product made available to the public with respect to rela\ntive creative contribution, technological contribution, capital investment,\ncost, risk, and contribution to the opening of new markets for creative\nexpression and media for their communication;\n(D) To minimize any disruptive impact on the structure of the indus\ntries involved and on generally prevailing industry practices.\n(2) To make determinations concerning the adjustment of the copy\nright royalty rates in section 111 solely in accordance with the following\nprovisions:\n(A) The rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to\nreflect (i) national monetary inflation or deflation or (ii) changes in the\naverage rates charged cable subscribers for the basic service of provid\ning secondary transmissions to maintain the real constant dollar level of\nthe royalty fee per subscriber which existed as of the date of enactment\nof this Act: Provided, That if the average rates charged cable system sub\nscribers for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions are\nchanged so that the average rates exceed national monetary inflation, no\nchange in the rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) shall be permitted:\nAnd provided further, That no increase in the royalty fee shall be permit\nted based on any reduction in the average number of distant signal equiva\nlents per subscriber. The copyright arbitration royalty panels may con\nsider all factors relating to the maintenance of such level of payments\nincluding, as an extenuating factor, whether the industry has been re\nstrained by subscriber rate regulating authorities from increasing the\nrates for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nCopyright Arbitration Royalty Panels\n§ 801\n(B) In the event that the rules and regulations of the Federal Commu\nnications Commission are amended at any time after April 15, 1976, to\npermit the carriage by cable systems of additional television broadcast\nsignals beyond the local service area of the primary transmitters of such\nsignals, the royalty rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be ad\njusted to insure that the rates for the additional distant signal equivalents\nresulting from such carriage are reasonable in the light of the changes\neffected by the amendment to such rules and regulations. In determin\ning the reasonableness of rates proposed following an amendment of\nFederal Communications Commission rules and regulations, the copy\nright arbitration royalty panels shall consider, among other factors, the\neconomic impact on copyright owners and users: Provided, That no ad\njustment in royalty rates shall be made under this subclause with respect\nto any distant signal equivalent or fraction thereof represented by (i) car\nriage of any signal permitted under the rules and regulations of the Fed\neral Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976, or the\ncarriage of a signal of the same type (that is, independent, network, or\nnoncommercial educational) substituted for such permitted signal, or (ii)\na television broadcast signal first carried after April 15, 1976, pursuant to\nan individual waiver of the rules and regulations of the Federal Commu\nnications Commission, as such rules and regulations were in effect on\nApril 15,1976.\n(C) In the event of any change in the rules and regulations of the Fed\neral Communications Commission with respect to syndicated and sports\nprogram exclusivity after April 15, 1976, the rates established by section\n111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to assure that such rates are reasonable in\nlight of the changes to such rules and regulations, but any such adjust\nment shall apply only to the affected television broadcast signals carried\non those systems affected by the change.\n(D) The gross receipts limitations established by section 111(d)(1)(C) and\n(D) shall be adjusted to reflect national monetary inflation or deflation or\nchanges in the average rates charged cable system subscribers for the basic\nservice of providing secondary transmissions to maintain the real constant\ndollar value of the exemption provided by such section; and the royalty rate\nspecified therein shall not be subject to adjustment.\n(3) To distribute royalty fees deposited with the Register of Copyrights un\nder sections 111, 116, 119(b), and 1003, and to determine, in cases where con\ntroversy exists, the distribution of such fees.\n(c) Rulings.--The Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the\nRegister of Copyrights, may, before a copyright arbitration royalty panel is con\nvened, make any necessary procedural or evidentiary rulings that would apply\nto the proceedings conducted by such panel, including--\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 801\nCopyright Arbitration Royalty Panels\n(1) authorizing the distribution of those royalty fees collected under sec\ntions 111, 119, and 1005 that the Librarian has found are not subject to con\ntroversy; and\n(2) accepting or rejecting royalty claims filed under sections 111, 119, and\n1007 on the basis of timeliness or the failure to establish the basis for a claim.\n(d) Support and Reimbursement of Arbitration Panels.--The Librarian\nof Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, shall provide\nthe copyright arbitration royalty panels with the necessary administrative services\nrelated to proceedings under this chapter, and shall reimburse the arbitrators pre\nsiding in distribution proceedings at such intervals and in such manner as the Li\nbrarian shall provide by regulation.

Such rules and regulations shall\nremain in effect unless and until the Librarian, upon the recommendation of the\nRegister of Copyrights, adopts supplemental or superseding regulations under\nsubchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.\n(e) Report to the Librarian of Congress.--Not later than 180 days after\npublication of the notice in the Federal Register initiating an arbitration proceed\ning, the copyright arbitration royalty panel conducting the proceeding shall re\nport to the Librarian of Congress its determination concerning the royalty fee or\ndistribution of royalty fees, as the case may be. Such report shall be accompanied\nby the written record, and shall set forth the facts that the arbitration panel found\nrelevant to its determination.\n(f) Action by Librarian of Congress.--Within 90 days after receiving the\nreport of a copyright arbitration royalty panel under subsection (e), the Librar\nian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, shall\nadopt or reject the determination of the arbitration panel. The Librarian shall\nadopt the determination of the arbitration panel unless the Librarian finds that\nthe determination is arbitrary or contrary to the applicable provisions of this title.\nIf the Librarian rejects the determination of the arbitration panel, the Librarian\nshall, before the end of an additional 30-day period, and after full examination of\nthe record created in the arbitration proceeding, issue an order setting the royalty\nfee or distribution of fees, as the case may be.

vessel hull, including a plug or mold,\nis subject to protection under this chapter, notwithstanding section 1302(4).\n(b) Definitions.--For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms have\nthe following meanings:\n(1) A design is \"original\" if it is the result of the designer's creative endeavor\nthat provides a distinguishable variation over prior work pertaining to simi\nlar articles which is more than merely trivial and has not been copied from an\nother source.\n(2) A \"useful article\" is a vessel hull, including a plug or mold, which in nor\nmal use has an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the\nappearance of the article or to convey information. An article which normally\nis part of a useful article shall be deemed to be a useful article.\n(3) A \"vessel\" is a craft--\n(A) that is designed and capable of independently steering a course on\nor through water through its own means of propulsion; and\n(B) that is designed and capable of carrying and transporting one or\nmore passengers.\n(4) A \"hull\" is the frame or body of a vessel, including the deck of a vessel,\nexclusive of masts, sails, yards, and rigging.\n(5) A \"plug\" means a device or model used to make a mold for the purpose\nof exact duplication, regardless of whether the device or model has an intrin\nsic utilitarian function that is not only to portray the appearance of the prod\nuct or to convey information.\n(6) A \"mold\" means a matrix or form in which a substance for material is used,\nregardless of whether the matrix or form has an intrinsic utilitarian function that\nis not only to portray the appearance of the product or to convey information.\n§ 1302 · Designs not subject to protection3\nProtection under this chapter shall not be available for a design that is--\n(1) not original;\n(2) staple or commonplace, such as a standard geometric figure, a familiar\nsymbol, an emblem, or a motif, or another shape, pattern, or configuration\nwhich has become standard, common, prevalent, or ordinary;\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\nProtection of Original Designs\n§ 1305\n(3) different from a design excluded by paragraph (2) only in insignificant\ndetails or in elements which are variants commonly used in the relevant trades;\n(4) dictated solely by a utilitarian function of the article that embodies it; or\n(5) embodied in a useful article that was made public by the designer or\nowner in the United States or a foreign country more than 2 years before the\ndate of the application for registration under this chapter.\n§ 1303 · Revisions, adaptations, and rearrangements\nProtection for a design under this chapter shall be available notwithstanding\nthe employment in the design of subject matter excluded from protection\nunder section 1302 if the design is a substantial revision, adaptation, or rear\nrangement of such subject matter. Such protection shall be independent of\nany subsisting protection in subject matter employed in the design, and shall\nnot be construed as securing any right to subject matter excluded from pro\ntection under this chapter or as extending any subsisting protection under this\nchapter.\n§ 1304 · Commencement of protection\nThe protection provided for a design under this chapter shall commence upon\nthe earlier of the date of publication of the registration under section 1313(a) or\nthe date the design is first made public as defined by section 1310(b).\n§ 1305 · Term of protection\n(a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the protection provided under this\nchapter for a design shall continue for a term of 10 years beginning on the date\nof the commencement of protection under section 1304.\n(b) Expiration.--All terms of protection provided in this section shall run\nto the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.\n(c) Termination of Rights.--Upon expiration or termination of protection\nin a particular design under this chapter, all rights under this chapter in the de\nsign shall terminate, regardless of the number of different articles in which the\ndesign may have been used during the term of its protection.\nCopyright Law of the United States\n\n§ 1306\nProtection of Original Designs\n§ 1306 · Design notice\n(a) Contents of Design Notice.--\n(1) Whenever any design for which protection is sought under this chapter\nis made public under section 1310(b), the owner of the design shall, subject to\nthe provisions of section 1307, mark it or have it marked legibly with a design\nnotice consisting of--\n(A) the words \"Protected Design\", the abbreviation \"Prot'd Des.\", or the\nletter \"D\" within a circle, ∂, or the symbol \"*D*\";\n(B) the year of the date on which protection for the design commenced; and\n(C) the name of the owner, an abbreviation by which the name can be\nrecognized, or a generally accepted alternative designation of the owner.\nAny distinctive identification of the owner may be used for purposes of subpara\ngraph (C) if it has been recorded by the Administrator before the design marked\nwith such identification is registered.\n(2) After registration, the registration number may be used instead of the\nelements specified in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1).\n(b) Location of Notice.--The design notice shall be so located and applied\nas to give reasonable notice of design protection while the useful article embody\ning the design is passing through its normal channels of commerce.\n(c) Subsequent Removal of Notice.--When the owner of a design has com\nplied with the provisions of this section, protection under this chapter shall not\nbe affected by the removal, destruction, or obliteration by others of the design\nnotice on an article.\n§ 1307 · Effect of omission of notice\n(a) Actions with Notice.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the omis\nsion of the notice prescribed in section 1306 shall not cause loss of the protec\ntion under this chapter or prevent recovery for infringement under this chapter\nagainst any person who, after receiving written notice of the design protection,\nbegins an undertaking leading to infringement under this chapter.\n(b) Actions without Notice.--The omission of the notice prescribed in sec\ntion 1306 shall prevent any recovery under section 1323 against a person who be\ngan an undertaking leading to infringement under this chapter before receiving\nwritten notice of the design protection.

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.\nWhen the Framers of the First Amendment prohibited\nCongress from making any law \"abridging the freedom of speech,\"\nthey were not thinking about computers, computer programs, or the\nInternet. But neither were they thinking about radio, television,\nor movies. Just as the inventions at the beginning and middle of\nthe 20th century presented new First Amendment issues, so does the\n-4\n\ncyber revolution at the end of that century. This appeal raises\nsignificant First Amendment issues concerning one aspect of\ncomputer technology--encryption to protect materials in digital\nform from unauthorized access.\nThe appeal challenges the\nconstitutionality of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n(\"DMCA\"), 17 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq. (Supp. V 1999) and the validity\nof an injunction entered to enforce the DMCA.\nDefendant-Appellant Eric C. Corley and his company, 2600\nEnterprises, Inc., (collectively \"Corley,\" \"the Defendants,\" or\n\"the Appellants\") appeal from the amended final judgment of the\nUnited\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York (Lewis\nA. Kaplan, District Judge), entered August 23, 2000, enjoining\nthem from various actions concerning a decryption program known\nas \"DeCSS.\" Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F.\nSupp. 2d 346 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (\"Universal II\"). The injunction\nprimarily bars the Appellants from posting DeCSS on their web site\nand from knowingly linking their web site to any other web site\non which DeCSS is posted. Id. at 346-47. We affirm.\nIntroduction\nUnderstanding the pending appeal and the issues it\n-5\n\nraises requires some familiarity with technical aspects of\ncomputers and computer software, especially software called\n\"digital versatile disks\" or \"DVDs,\" which are optical media\nstorage devices currently designed to contain movies.1\nThose\nlacking such familiarity will be greatly aided by reading Judge\nKaplan's extremely lucid opinion, Universal City Studios, Inc. v.\nReimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 294 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (\"Universal I\"),\nbeginning with his helpful section \"The Vocabulary of this Case,\"\nid. at 305-09.\nThis appeal concerns the anti-trafficking provisions of\nthe DMCA, which Congress enacted in 1998 to strengthen copyright\nprotection in the digital age. Fearful that the ease with which\npirates could copy and distribute a copyrightable work in digital\nform was overwhelming the capacity of conventional copyright\nenforcement to find and enjoin unlawfully copied material,\nCongress sought to combat copyright piracy in its earlier stages,\nbefore the work was even copied. The DMCA therefore backed with\n1DVDs are similar to compact disks (CDs), but differ, among\nother things, in that they hold far more data. For detailed\ninformation concerning DVDs and CDs, see \"Fast Guide to CD/DVD\"\na\nt\nhttp://searchWindowsManageability.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,\n,sid_gci514667,00.html (last updated Aug. 3, 2001).\n-6\n\nlegal sanctions the efforts of copyright owners to protect their\nworks from piracy behind digital walls such as encryption codes\nor password protections. In so doing, Congress targeted not only\nthose pirates who would circumvent these digital walls (the \"anti-\ncircumvention provisions,\" contained in 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)),\nbut also anyone who would traffic in a technology primarily\ndesigned to circumvent a digital wall (the \"anti-trafficking\nprovisions,\" contained in 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2), (b)(1)).\nCorley publishes a print magazine and maintains an\naffiliated web site geared towards \"hackers,\" a digital-era term\noften applied to those interested in techniques for circumventing\nprotections of computers and computer data from unauthorized\naccess. The so-called hacker community includes serious computer-\nscience scholars conducting research on protection techniques,\ncomputer buffs intrigued by the challenge of trying to circumvent\naccess-limiting devices or perhaps hoping to promote security by\nexposing flaws in protection techniques, mischief-makers inter\nested in disrupting computer operations, and thieves, including\ncopyright infringers who want to acquire copyrighted material (for\npersonal use or resale) without paying for it.\nIn November 1999, Corley posted a copy of the decryption\n-7\n\ncomputer program \"DeCSS\" on his web site, http://www.2600.com\n(\"2600.com\").2\nDeCSS is designed to circumvent \"CSS,\" the\nencryption technology that motion picture studios place on DVDs\nto prevent the unauthorized viewing and copying of motion\npictures. Corley also posted on his web site links to other web\nsites where DeCSS could be found.\nPlaintiffs-Appellees are eight motion picture studios\nthat brought an action in the Southern District of New York\nseeking injunctive relief against Corley under the DMCA.\nFollowing a full non-jury trial, the District Court entered a\npermanent injunction barring Corley from posting DeCSS on his web\nsite or from knowingly linking via a hyperlink to any other web\nsite containing DeCSS. Universal II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 346-47.\nThe District Court rejected Corley's constitutional attacks on the\n2\"2600\" has special significance to the hacker community. It\nis the hertz frequency (\"a unit of frequency of a periodic process\nequal to one cycle per second,\" Webster's Third New International\nDictionary 1061 (1993)) of a signal that some hackers formerly\nused to explore the entire telephone system from \"operator mode,\"\nwhich was triggered by the transmission of a 2600 hertz tone\nacross a telephone line, Trial Tr. at 786-87, or to place\ntelephone calls without incurring long-distance toll charges,\nUnited States v. Brady, 820 F. Supp. 1346, 1355 & n.18 (D. Utah\n1993). One such user reportedly discovered that the sound of a\ntoy whistle from a box of Cap'n Crunch cereal matched the\ntelephone company's 2600 hertz tone perfectly. Id. at 1355 n.18.\n-8\n\nstatute and the injunction. Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 325\n45.\nCorley renews his constitutional challenges on appeal.\nSpecifically, he argues primarily that: (1) the DMCA oversteps\nlimits in the Copyright Clause on the duration of copyright\nprotection; (2) the DMCA as applied to his dissemination of DeCSS\nviolates the First Amendment because computer code is \"speech\"\nentitled to full First Amendment protection and the DMCA fails to\nsurvive the exacting scrutiny accorded statutes that regulate\n\"speech\"; and (3) the DMCA violates the First Amendment and the\nCopyright Clause by unduly obstructing the \"fair use\" of copy\nrighted materials.\nCorley also argues that the statute is\nsusceptible to, and should therefore be given, a narrow interpre\ntation that avoids alleged constitutional objections.\nBackground\nFor decades, motion picture studios have made movies\navailable for viewing at home in what is called \"analog\" format.\nMovies in this format are placed on videotapes, which can be\nplayed on a video cassette recorder (\"VCR\"). In the early 1990s,\nthe studios began to consider the possibility of distributing\nmovies in digital form as well. Movies in digital form are placed\n-9\n\non disks, known as DVDs, which can be played on a DVD player\n(either a stand-alone device or a component of a computer). DVDs\noffer advantages over analog tapes, such as improved visual and\naudio quality, larger data capacity, and greater durability.\nHowever, the improved quality of a movie in a digital format\nbrings with it the risk that a virtually perfect copy, i.e., one\nthat will not lose perceptible quality in the copying process, can\nbe readily made at the click of a computer control and instantly\ndistributed to countless recipients throughout the world over the\nInternet. This case arises out of the movie industry's efforts\nto respond to this risk by invoking the anti-trafficking provi\nsions of the DMCA.\nI. CSS\nThe movie studios were reluctant to release movies in\ndigital form until they were confident they had in place adequate\nsafeguards against piracy of their copyrighted movies. The\nstudios took several steps to minimize the piracy threat. First,\nthey settled on the DVD as the standard digital medium for home\ndistribution of movies. The studios then sought an encryption\nscheme to protect movies on DVDs.\nThey enlisted the help of\nmembers of the consumer electronics and computer industries, who\n-10\n\nin mid-1996 developed the Content Scramble System (\"CSS\"). CSS\nis an encryption scheme that employs an algorithm configured by\na set of \"keys\" to encrypt a DVD's contents. The algorithm is a\ntype of mathematical formula for transforming the contents of the\nmovie file into gibberish; the \"keys\" are in actuality strings of\n0's and 1's that serve as values for the mathematical formula.\nDecryption in the case of CSS requires a set of \"player keys\"\ncontained in compliant DVD players, as well as an understanding\nof the CSS encryption algorithm. Without the player keys and the\nalgorithm, a DVD player cannot access the contents of a DVD. With\nthe player keys and the algorithm, a DVD player can display the\nmovie on a television or a computer screen, but does not give a\nviewer the ability to use the copy function of the computer to\ncopy the movie or to manipulate the digital content of the DVD.\nThe studios developed a licensing scheme for distribut\ning the technology to manufacturers of DVD players. Player keys\nand other information necessary to the CSS scheme were given to\nmanufacturers of DVD players for an administrative fee. In\nexchange for the licenses, manufacturers were obliged to keep the\nplayer keys confidential. Manufacturers were also required in the\nlicensing agreement to prevent the transmission of \"CSS data\" (a\n-11\n\nterm undefined in the licensing agreement) from a DVD drive to any\n\"internal recording device,\" including, presumably, a computer\nhard drive.\nWith encryption technology and licensing agreements in\nhand, the studios began releasing movies on DVDs in 1997, and DVDs\nquickly gained in popularity, becoming a significant source of\nstudio revenue.3 In 1998, the studios secured added protection\nagainst DVD piracy when Congress passed the DMCA, which prohibits\nthe development or use of technology designed to circumvent a\ntechnological protection measure, such as CSS. The pertinent\nprovisions of the DMCA are examined in greater detail below.\nII. DeCSS\nIn September 1999, Jon Johansen, a Norwegian teenager,\ncollaborating with two unidentified individuals he met on the\nInternet, reverse-engineered a licensed DVD player designed to\n3By the end of 1997, most if not all DVDs that were released\nwere encrypted with CSS. Trial Tr. at 409; Universal I, 111 F.\nSupp. 2d at 310. Moreover, DVD players were projected to be in\nten percent of United States homes by the end of 2000. Trial Tr.\nat 442; Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 310. In fact, as of 2000,\nabout thirty-five percent of one studio's worldwide revenues from\nmovie distribution was attributable to DVD sales and rentals.\nTrial Tr. at 403; Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 310 n.69.\n-12\n\noperate on the Microsoft operating system, and culled from it the\nplayer keys and other information necessary to decrypt CSS. The\nrecord suggests that Johansen was trying to develop a DVD player\noperable on Linux, an alternative operating system that did not\nsupport any licensed DVD players at that time. In order to\naccomplish this task, Johansen wrote a decryption program\nexecutable on Microsoft's operating system.4 That program was\ncalled, appropriately enough, \"DeCSS.\"\nIf a user runs the DeCSS program (for example, by\nclicking on the DeCSS icon on a Microsoft operating system\nplatform) with a DVD in the computer's disk drive, DeCSS will\ndecrypt the DVD's CSS protection, allowing the user to copy the\nDVD's files and place the copy on the user's hard drive. The\nresult is a very large computer file that can be played on a\nnon-CSS-compliant player and copied, manipulated, and transferred\n4An operating system works with the computer to perform the\napplication's instructions. Generally, an executable application\ncan be played only on the operating system for which it is\ndesigned, although interoperability has been improving. At the\ntime of the trial, DeCSS could be run only on the Microsoft\nWindows operating system. Trial Tr. at 245 (Testimony of Robert\nW. Schumann).\n-13\n\njust like any other computer file.5 DeCSS comes complete with a\n5An item of some controversy, both in this litigation and\nelsewhere, is the extent to which CSS-encrypted DVDs can be copied\neven without DeCSS. The record leaves largely unclear how CSS\nprotects against the copying of a DVD, as contrasted with the\nplaying of a DVD on an unlicensed player. The Defendants' experts\ninsisted that there is nothing about the way CSS operates that\nprevents the copying of a DVD. Declaration of Frank Stevenson ¶\n23 (\"Bit-for-bit copying, which precisely duplicates the content\nof one DVD to another, results in a fully-playable product.\");\nTrial Tr. at 751 (Testimony of Professor Edward Felten) (CSS\n\"could [not] have prevented the encrypted content from being\ncopied to somewhere else\"); Deposition of Barbara Simons at 48-49,\n77. Some of the Plaintiffs' experts countered simply that \"copying\nto a hard drive is something that compliant DVD players are not\nallowed to do,\" without explaining why.\nTrial Tr. at 37\n(Testimony of Dr. Michael I. Shamos); see also Deposition of John\nJ. Hoy at 347-48; Deposition of Fritz Attaway at 83.\nAnother\nexpert indicated that while a DVD movie can be copied to a\ncomputer's hard drive in encrypted form, the movie cannot be\nplayed without a DVD actually present in the DVD drive.\nDeposition of Robert W. Schumann at 153; Second Supplemental\nDeclaration of Robert W. Schumann ¶ 15.\nThis expert did not\nidentify the mechanism that prevents someone from copying\nencrypted DVDs to a hard drive in the absence of a DVD in the disk\ndrive.\nHowever, none of this detracts from these undisputed\nfindings: some feature of either CSS itself, or another\n(unidentified) safeguard implemented by DVD manufacturers pursuant\nto their obligations under the CSS licensing scheme, makes it\ndifficult to copy a CSS-encrypted DVD to a hard drive and then\ncompress that DVD to the point where transmission over the\nInternet is practical. See Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 338.\nConversely, a DVD movie file without CSS encryption is easily\ncopied, manipulated, and transferred. See id. at 313. In other\nwords, it might very well be that copying is not blocked by CSS\nitself, but by some other protection implemented by the DVD player\nmanufacturers. Nonetheless, in decrypting CSS, the DeCSS program\n-14\n\nfairly user-friendly interface that helps the user select from\namong the DVD's files and assign the decrypted file a location on\nthe user's hard drive. The quality of the resulting decrypted\nmovie is \"virtually identical\" to that of the encrypted movie on\nthe DVD. Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 308, 313. And the file\nproduced by DeCSS, while large, can be compressed to a manageable\nsize by a compression software called \"DivX,\" available at no cost\non the Internet. This compressed file can be copied onto a DVD,\nor transferred over the Internet (with some patience).6\n(perhaps incidentally) sidesteps whatever it is that blocks\ncopying of the files.\nWhile there may be alternative means of extracting a\nnon-encrypted, copyable movie from a DVD--for example, by copying\nthe movie along with its encryption \"bit-by-bit,\" or \"ripping\" a\nDVD by siphoning movie file data after CSS has already been\ndecrypted by a licensed player--DeCSS is the superior means of\nacquiring easily copyable movies, see id. at 342, and in fact, is\nrecommended by a DVD compression web site as the preferred tool\nfor obtaining a decrypted DVD suitable for compression and\ntransmission over the Internet, see id.\nWe acknowledge the\ncomplexity and the rapidly changing nature of the technology\ninvolved in this case, but it is clear that the Defendants have\npresented no evidence to refute any of these carefully considered\nfindings by the District Court.\n6The District Court determined that even at high speeds,\ntypical of university networks, transmission times ranged from\nthree minutes to six hours. The Court noted, however, that \"the\navailability of high speed network connections in many businesses\nand institutions, and their growing availability in homes, make\nInternet and other network traffic in pirated copies a growing\n-15\n\nJohansen posted the executable object code, but not the\nsource code, for DeCSS on his web site. The distinction between\nsource code and object code is relevant to this case, so a brief\nexplanation is warranted. A computer responds to electrical\ncharges, the presence or absence of which is represented by\nstrings of 1's and 0's. Strictly speaking, \"object code\" consists\nof those 1's and 0's. Trial Tr. at 759 (Testimony of Professor\nEdward Felton). While some people can read and program in object\ncode, \"it would be inconvenient, inefficient and, for most people,\nprobably impossible to do so.\" Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at\n306. Computer languages have been written to facilitate program\nwriting and reading. A program in such a computer language\n-BASIC, C, and Java are examples--is said to be written in \"source\ncode.\" Source code has the benefit of being much easier to read\n(by people) than object code, but as a general matter, it must be\ntranslated back to object code before it can be read by a\ncomputer. This task is usually performed by a program called a\ncompiler. Since computer languages range in complexity, object\ncode can be placed on one end of a spectrum, and different kinds\nthreat.\" Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 315.\n-16\n\nof source code can be arrayed across the spectrum according to the\nease with which they are read and understood by humans. See Trial\nExhibits BBC (Declaration of David S. Touretzky), BBE (Touretzky\nArticle: Source v. Object Code: A False Dichotomy). Within months\nof its appearance in executable form on Johansen's web site, DeCSS\nwas widely available on the Internet, in both object code and\nvarious forms of source code. See Trial Exhibit CCN (Touretzky\nArticle: Gallery of CSS Descramblers).\nIn November 1999, Corley wrote and placed on his web\nsite, 2600.com, an article about the DeCSS phenomenon. His web\nsite is an auxiliary to the print magazine, 2600: The Hacker\nQuarterly, which Corley has been publishing since 1984.7 As the\nname suggests, the magazine is designed for \"hackers,\" as is the\nweb site. While the magazine and the web site cover some issues\nof general interest to computer users--such as threats to online\nprivacy--the focus of the publications is on the vulnerability of\ncomputer security systems, and more specifically, how to exploit\n7Defendant 2600 Enterprises, Inc., is the company Corley\nincorporated to run the magazine, maintain the web site, and\nmanage related endeavors like merchandising.\n-17\n\nthat vulnerability in order to circumvent the security systems.\nRepresentative articles explain how to steal an Internet domain\nname and how to break into the computer systems at Federal\nExpress. Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 308-09.\nCorley's article about DeCSS detailed how CSS was\ncracked, and described the movie industry's efforts to shut down\nweb sites posting DeCSS. It also explained that DeCSS could be\nused to copy DVDs. At the end of the article, the Defendants\nposted copies of the object and source code of DeCSS. In Corley's\nwords, he added the code to the story because \"in a journalistic\nworld, . . . [y]ou have to show your evidence . . . and particu\nlarly in the magazine that I work for, people want to see\nspecifically what it is that we are referring to,\" including \"what\nevidence . . . we have\" that there is in fact technology that\ncircumvents CSS. Trial Tr. at 823. Writing about DeCSS without\nincluding the DeCSS code would have been, to Corley, \"analogous\nto printing a story about a picture and not printing the picture.\"\nId. at 825.\nCorley also added to the article links that he\nexplained would take the reader to other web sites where DeCSS\n-18\n\ncould be found. Id. at 791, 826, 827, 848.\n2600.com was only one of hundreds of web sites that\nbegan posting DeCSS near the end of 1999. The movie industry\ntried to stem the tide by sending cease-and-desist letters to many\nof these sites. These efforts met with only partial success; a\nnumber of sites refused to remove DeCSS. In January 2000, the\nstudios filed this lawsuit.8\nIII. The DMCA\nThe DMCA was enacted in 1998 to implement the World\nIntellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty (\"WIPO\nTreaty\"), which requires contracting parties to \"provide adequate\nlegal protection and effective legal remedies against the\ncircumvention of effective technological measures that are used\nby authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under\nthis Treaty or the Berne Convention and that restrict acts, in\nrespect of their works, which are not authorized by the authors\n8The lawsuit was filed against Corley, Shawn C. Reimerdes,\nand Roman Kazan. 2600 Enterprises, Inc., was later added as a\ndefendant. At an earlier stage of the litigation, the action was\nsettled as to Reimerdes and Kazan. See Universal II, 111 F. Supp.\n2d at 346.\n-19\n\nconcerned or permitted by law.\" WIPO Treaty, Apr. 12, 1997, art.\n11, S. Treaty Doc. No. 105-17 (1997), available at 1997 WL 447232.\nEven before the treaty, Congress had been devoting attention to\nthe problems faced by copyright enforcement in the digital age.\nHearings on the topic have spanned several years. See, e.g., WIPO\nCopyright Treaties Implementation Act and Online Copyright\nLiability Limitation Act: Hearing on H.R. 2281 and H.R. 2280\nBefore the Subcomm. on Courts and Intellectual Property of the\nHouse Comm. on the Judiciary, 105th Cong. (1997); NII Copyright\nProtection Act of 1995: Hearings on H.R. 2441 Before the Subcomm.\non Courts and Intellectual Property of the House Comm. on the\nJudiciary, 104th Cong. (1996); NII Copyright Protection Act of\n1995: Joint Hearing on H.R. 2441 and S. 1284 Before the Subcomm.\non Courts and Intellectual Property of the House Comm. on the\nJudiciary and the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong.\n(1995); H.R. Rep. No. 105-551 (1998); S. Rep. No. 105-190 (1998).\nThis legislative effort resulted in the DMCA.\nThe Act contains three provisions targeted at the\ncircumvention of technological protections.\nThe first is\n-20\n\nsubsection 1201(a)(1)(A), the anti-circumvention provision.9 This\nprovision prohibits a person from \"circumvent[ing] a technological\nmeasure that effectively controls access to a work protected under\n[Title 17, governing copyright].\" The Librarian of Congress is\nrequired to promulgate regulations every three years exempting\nfrom this subsection individuals who would otherwise be \"adversely\naffected\" in \"their ability to make noninfringing uses.\" 17 U.S.C.\n§ 1201(a)(1)(B)-(E).\nThe second and third provisions are subsections\n1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1), the \"anti-trafficking provisions.\"\nSubsection 1201(a)(2), the provision at issue in this case,\nprovides:\nNo person shall manufacture, import,\noffer to the public, provide, or otherwise\ntraffic in any technology, product, service,\ndevice, component, or part thereof, that--\n(A) is primarily designed or produced for\nthe purpose of circumventing a technological\nmeasure that effectively controls access to a\n9For convenience, all references to the DMCA are to the\nUnited State Code sections.\n-21\n\nwork protected under this title;\n(B) has only limited commercially signif\nicant purpose or use other than to circumvent\na technological measure that effectively\ncontrols access to a work protected under this\ntitle; or\n(C) is marketed by that person or another\nacting in concert with that person with that\nperson's knowledge for use in circumventing a\ntechnological measure that effectively con\ntrols access to a work protected under this\ntitle.\nId. § 1201(a)(2).\nTo \"circumvent a technological measure\" is\ndefined, in pertinent part, as \"to descramble a scrambled work\n. . . or otherwise to . . . bypass . . . a technological measure,\nwithout\nthe\nauthority\nof\nthe\ncopyright\nowner.\"\nId.\n§\n1201(a)(3)(A).\nSubsection\n1201(b)(1)\nis\nsimilar\nto\nsubsection\n1201(a)(2), except that subsection 1201(a)(2) covers those who\ntraffic in technology that can circumvent \"a technological measure\nthat effectively controls access to a work protected under\" Title\n17, whereas subsection 1201(b)(1) covers those who traffic in\n-22\n\ntechnology that can circumvent \"protection afforded by a\ntechnological measure that effectively protects a right of a\ncopyright owner under\" Title 17. Id. § 1201(a)(2), (b)(1)\n(emphases added). In other words, although both subsections\nprohibit trafficking in a circumvention technology, the focus of\nsubsection 1201(a)(2) is circumvention of technologies designed\nto prevent access to a work, and the focus of subsection\n1201(b)(1) is circumvention of technologies designed to permit\naccess to a work but prevent copying of the work or some other act\nthat infringes a copyright. See S. Rep. No. 105-190, at 11-12\n(1998). Subsection 1201(a)(1) differs from both of these anti-\ntrafficking subsections in that it targets the use of a\ncircumvention technology, not the trafficking in such a\ntechnology.\nThe DMCA contains exceptions for schools and libraries\nthat want to use circumvention technologies to determine whether\nto purchase a copyrighted product, 17 U.S.C. § 1201(d);\nindividuals using circumvention technology \"for the sole purpose\"\n-23\n\nof trying to achieve \"interoperability\" of computer programs\nthrough reverse-engineering, id. § 1201(f); encryption research\naimed at identifying flaws in encryption technology, if the\nresearch is conducted to advance the state of knowledge in the\nfield, id. § 1201(g); and several other exceptions not relevant\nhere.\nThe DMCA creates civil remedies, id. § 1203, and\ncriminal sanctions, id. § 1204.\nIt specifically authorizes a\ncourt to \"grant temporary and permanent injunctions on such terms\nas it deems reasonable to prevent or restrain a violation.\" Id.\n§ 1203(b)(1).\nIV. Procedural History\nInvoking subsection 1203(b)(1), the Plaintiffs sought an\ninjunction against the Defendants, alleging that the Defendants\nviolated the anti-trafficking provisions of the statute. On\nJanuary 20, 2000, after a hearing, the District Court issued a\npreliminary injunction barring the Defendants from posting DeCSS.\nUniversal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 82 F. Supp. 2d 211\n-24\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2000).\nThe Defendants complied with the preliminary injunction,\nbut continued to post links to other web sites carrying DeCSS, an\naction they termed \"electronic civil disobedience.\" Universal I,\n111 F. Supp. 2d at 303, 312. Under the heading \"Stop the MPAA\n[(Motion Picture Association of America)],\" Corley urged other web\nsites to post DeCSS lest \"we . . . be forced into submission.\" Id.\nat 313.\nThe Plaintiffs then sought a permanent injunction\nbarring the Defendants from both posting DeCSS and linking to\nsites containing DeCSS. After a trial on the merits, the Court\nissued a comprehensive opinion, Universal I, and granted a\npermanent injunction, Universal II.\nThe Court explained that the Defendants' posting of\nDeCSS on their web site clearly falls within section 1201(a)(2)(A)\nof the DMCA, rejecting as spurious their claim that CSS is not a\ntechnological measure that \"effectively controls access to a work\"\nbecause it was so easily penetrated by Johansen, Universal I, 111\n-25\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 318, and as irrelevant their contention that DeCSS\nwas designed to create a Linux-platform DVD player, id. at 319.\nThe Court also held that the Defendants cannot avail themselves\nof any of the DMCA's exceptions, id. at 319-22, and that the\nalleged importance of DeCSS to certain fair uses of encrypted\ncopyrighted material was immaterial to their statutory liability,\nid. at 322-24. The Court went on to hold that when the Defendants\n\"proclaimed on their own site that DeCSS could be had by clicking\non the hyperlinks\" on their site, they were trafficking in DeCSS,\nand therefore liable for their linking as well as their posting.\nId. at 325.\nTurning to the Defendants' numerous constitutional\narguments, the Court first held that computer code like DeCSS is\n\"speech\" that is \"protected\" (in the sense of \"covered\") by the\nFirst Amendment, id. at 327, but that because the DMCA is\ntargeting the \"functional\" aspect of that speech, id. at 328-29,\n-26\n\nit is \"content neutral,\" id. at 329,10 and the intermediate\nscrutiny of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968),\napplies, Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 329-30.\nThe Court\nconcluded that the DMCA survives this scrutiny, id. at 330-33, and\nalso rejected prior restraint, overbreadth, and vagueness\nchallenges, id. at 333-39.\nThe Court upheld the constitutionality of the DMCA's\napplication to linking on similar grounds: linking, the Court\nconcluded, is \"speech,\" but the DMCA is content-neutral, targeting\nonly the functional components of that speech. Therefore, its\napplication to linking is also evaluated under O'Brien, and, thus\nevaluated, survives intermediate scrutiny. However, the Court\nconcluded that a blanket proscription on linking would create a\nrisk of chilling legitimate linking on the web. The Court\n10In a supplemental Order, the Court corrected a typographical\nerror in its opinion in Universal I by changing the first sentence\nof the first full paragraph at 111 F. Supp. 2d 328 to read\n\"Restrictions on the nonspeech elements of expressive conduct fall\ninto the content-neutral category.\" Universal City Studios, Inc.\nv. Reimerdes, No. 00 Civ. 0277 (LAK) (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2001).\n-27\n\ntherefore crafted a restrictive test for linking liability\n(discussed below) that it believed sufficiently mitigated that\nrisk. The Court then found its test satisfied in this case. Id.\nat 339-41.\nFinally, the Court concluded that an injunction was\nhighly appropriate in this case. The Court observed that DeCSS\nwas harming the Plaintiffs, not only because they were now exposed\nto the possibility of piracy and therefore were obliged to develop\ncostly new safeguards for DVDs, but also because, even if there\nwas only indirect evidence that DeCSS availability actually\nfacilitated DVD piracy,11 the threat of piracy was very real,\nparticularly as\nInternet transmission speeds continue to increase. Id. at 314-15,\n342. Acknowledging that DeCSS was (and still is) widely available\non the Internet, the Court expressed confidence in\nthe likelihood . . . that this decision will\nserve notice on others that \"the strong right\narm of equity\" may be brought to bear against\nthem absent a change in their conduct and thus\n11For example, advertisements for pirated DVDs rose\ndramatically in number after the release of DeCSS on the web, and\nDVD file compression web sites recommend the use of DeCSS.\nUniversal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 342.\n-28\n\ncontribute to a climate of appropriate respect\nfor intellectual property rights in an age in\nwhich the excitement of ready access to untold\nquantities of information has blurred in some\nminds the fact that taking what is not yours\nand not freely offered to you is stealing.\nId. at 345.\nThe Court's injunction barred the Defendants from:\n\"posting on any Internet web site\" DeCSS; \"in any other way . . .\noffering to the public, providing, or otherwise trafficking in\nDeCSS\"; violating the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA in\nany other manner, and finally \"knowingly linking any Internet web\nsite operated by them to any other web site containing DeCSS, or\nknowingly maintaining any such link, for the purpose of\ndisseminating DeCSS.\" Universal II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 346-47.\nThe Appellants have appealed from the permanent\ninjunction.\nThe United States has intervened in support of the\nconstitutionality of the DMCA.\nWe have also had the benefit of\na number of\namicus curiae briefs, supporting and opposing the District Court's\njudgment. After oral argument, we invited the parties to submit\nresponses to a series of specific questions, and we have received\n-29\n\nhelpful responses.\nDiscussion\nI. Narrow Construction to Avoid Constitutional Doubt\nThe\nAppellants\nfirst\nargue\nthat,\nbecause\ntheir\nconstitutional arguments are at least substantial, we should\ninterpret the statute narrowly so as to avoid constitutional\nproblems.\nThey identify three different instances of alleged\nambiguity in the statute that they claim provide an opportunity\nfor such a narrow interpretation.\nFirst, they contend that subsection 1201(c)(1), which\nprovides that \"[n]othing in this section shall affect rights,\nremedies, limitations or defenses to copyright infringement,\nincluding fair use, under this title,\" can be read to allow the\ncircumvention of encryption technology protecting copyrighted\nmaterial when the material will be put to \"fair uses\" exempt from\n-30\n\ncopyright liability.13\nWe disagree that subsection 1201(c)(1)\npermits such a reading. Instead, it clearly and simply clarifies\nthat the DMCA targets the circumvention of digital walls guarding\ncopyrighted material (and trafficking in circumvention tools), but\ndoes not concern itself with the use of those materials after\ncircumvention has occurred. Subsection 1201(c)(1) ensures that\nthe DMCA is not read to prohibit the \"fair use\" of information\njust because that information was obtained in a manner made\nillegal by the DMCA. The Appellants' much more expansive\ninterpretation of subsection 1201(c)(1) is not only outside the\nrange of plausible readings of the provision, but is also clearly\nrefuted by the statute's legislative history.14\nSee Commodity\n13In Part IV, infra, we consider the Appellants' claim that\nthe\nDMCA\nis\nunconstitutional\nbecause\nof\nits\neffect\non\nopportunities for fair use of copyrighted materials.\n14The legislative history of the enacted bill makes quite\nclear that Congress intended to adopt a \"balanced\" approach to\naccommodating both piracy and fair use concerns, eschewing the\nquick fix of simply exempting from the statute all circumventions\nfor fair use. H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt. 2, at 25 (1998). It\nsought to achieve this goal principally through the use of what\nit called a \"fail-safe\" provision in the statute, authorizing the\nLibrarian of Congress to exempt certain users from the anti-\ncircumvention provision when it becomes evident that in practice,\nthe statute is adversely affecting certain kinds of fair use. See\n17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(C); H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt. 2, at 36\n-31\n\nFutures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 841 (1986)\n(constitutional doubt canon \"does not give a court the prerogative\nto ignore the legislative will\").\nSecond, the Appellants urge a narrow construction of the\nDMCA because of subsection 1201(c)(4), which provides that\n\"[n]othing in this section shall enlarge or diminish any rights\nof free speech or the press for activities using consumer\nelectronics, telecommunications, or computing products.\"\nThis\nlanguage is clearly precatory: Congress could not \"diminish\"\nconstitutional rights of free speech even if it wished to, and the\n(\"Given the threat of a diminution of otherwise lawful access to\nworks and information, the Committee on Commerce believes that a\n'fail-safe' mechanism is required. This mechanism would . . .\nallow the . . . [waiver of the anti-circumvention provisions], for\nlimited time periods, if necessary to prevent a diminution in the\navailability to individual users of a particular category of\ncopyrighted materials.\").\nCongress also sought to implement a balanced approach through\nstatutory provisions that leave limited areas of breathing space\nfor fair use. A good example is subsection 1201(d), which allows\na library or educational institution to circumvent a digital wall\nin order to determine whether it wishes legitimately to obtain the\nmaterial behind the wall. See H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt. 2, at 41.\nIt would be strange for Congress to open small, carefully limited\nwindows for circumvention to permit fair use in subsection 1201(d)\nif it then meant to exempt in subsection 1201(c)(1) any\ncircumvention necessary for fair use.\n-32\n\nfact that Congress also expressed a reluctance to \"enlarge\" those\nrights cuts against the Appellants' effort to infer a narrowing\nconstruction of the Act from this provision.\nThird, the Appellants argue that an individual who buys\na DVD has the \"authority of the copyright owner\" to view the DVD,\nand therefore is exempted from the DMCA pursuant to subsection\n1201(a)(3)(A) when the buyer circumvents an encryption technology\nin order to view the DVD on a competing platform (such as Linux).\nThe basic flaw in this argument is that it misreads subsection\n1201(a)(3)(A). That provision exempts from liability those who\nwould \"decrypt\" an encrypted DVD with the authority of a copyright\nowner, not those who would \"view\" a DVD with the authority of a\ncopyright owner.15\nIn any event, the Defendants offered no\nevidence that the Plaintiffs have either explicitly or implicitly\n15This is actually what subsection 1201(a)(3)(A) means when\nread in conjunction with the anti-circumvention provisions. When\nread together with the anti-trafficking provisions, subsection\n1201(a)(3)(A) frees an individual to traffic in encryption\ntechnology designed or marketed to circumvent an encryption\nmeasure if the owner of the material protected by the encryption\nmeasure authorizes that circumvention.\n-33\n\nauthorized DVD buyers to circumvent encryption technology to\nsupport use on multiple platforms.16\nWe conclude that the anti-trafficking and anti-\ncircumvention provisions of the DMCA are not susceptible to the\nnarrow interpretations urged by the Appellants. We therefore\nproceed to consider the Appellants' constitutional claims.\nII. Constitutional Challenge Based on the Copyright Clause\nIn a footnote to their brief, the Appellants appear to\ncontend that the DMCA, as construed by the District Court, exceeds\nthe constitutional authority of Congress to grant authors\ncopyrights for a \"limited time,\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8,\nbecause it \"empower[s] copyright owners to effectively secure\nperpetual protection by mixing public domain works with\n16Even if the Defendants had been able to offer such evidence,\nand even if they could have demonstrated that DeCSS was \"primarily\ndesigned . . . for the purpose of\" playing DVDs on multiple\nplatforms (and therefore not for the purpose of \"circumventing a\ntechnological measure\"), a proposition questioned by Judge Kaplan,\nsee Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 311 n.79, the Defendants would\ndefeat liability only under subsection 1201(a)(2)(A). They would\nstill be vulnerable to liability under subsection 1201(a)(2)(C),\nbecause they \"marketed\" DeCSS for the copying of DVDs, not just\nfor the playing of DVDs on multiple platforms. See, e.g., Trial\nTr. at 820.\n-34\n\ncopyrighted materials, then locking both up with technological\nprotection measures.\" Brief for Appellants at 42 n.30. This\nargument is elaborated in the amici curiae brief filed by Prof.\nJulie E. Cohen on behalf of herself and 45 other intellectual\nproperty law professors. See also David Nimmer, A Riff on Fair\nUse in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev.\n673, 712 (2000). For two reasons, the argument provides no basis\nfor disturbing the judgment of the District Court.\nFirst, we have repeatedly ruled that arguments presented\nto us only in a footnote are not entitled to appellate\nconsideration. Concourse Rehabilitation & Nursing Center Inc. v.\nDeBuono, 179 F.3d 38, 47 (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Mapp,\n170 F.3d 328, 333 n.8 (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Restrepo,\n986 F.2d 1462, 1463 (2d Cir. 1993). Although an amicus brief can\nbe helpful in elaborating issues properly presented by the\nparties, it is normally not a method for injecting new issues into\nan appeal, at least in cases where the parties are competently\nrepresented by counsel. See, e.g., Concourse Center, 179 F.3d at\n47.\n-35\n\nSecond, to whatever extent the argument might have merit\nat some future time in a case with a properly developed record,\nthe argument is entirely premature and speculative at this time\non this record. There is not even a claim, much less evidence,\nthat any Plaintiff has sought to prevent copying of public domain\nworks, or that the injunction prevents the Defendants from copying\nsuch works.\nAs Judge Kaplan noted, the possibility that\nencryption would preclude access to public domain works \"does not\nyet appear to be a problem, although it may emerge as one in the\nfuture.\" Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 338 n.245.\nIII. Constitutional Challenges Based on the First Amendment\nA. Applicable Principles\nLast year, in one of our Court's first forays into First\nAmendment law in the digital age, we took an \"evolutionary\"\napproach to the task of tailoring familiar constitutional rules\nto novel technological circumstances, favoring \"narrow\" holdings\nthat would permit the law to mature on a \"case-by-case\" basis. See\nName.Space, Inc. v. Network Solutions, Inc., 202 F.3d 573, 584\nn.11 (2d Cir. 2000). In that spirit, we proceed, with appropriate\n-36\n\ncaution, to consider the Appellants' First Amendment challenges\nby analyzing a series of preliminary issues the resolution of\nwhich provides a basis for adjudicating the specific objections\nto the DMCA and its application to DeCSS. These issues, which we\nconsider only to the extent necessary to resolve the pending\nappeal, are whether computer code is speech, whether computer\nprograms are speech, the scope of First Amendment protection for\ncomputer code, and the scope of First Amendment protection for\ndecryption code. Based on our analysis of these issues, we then\nconsider the Appellants' challenge to the injunction's provisions\nconcerning posting and linking.\n1. Code as Speech\nCommunication does not lose constitutional protection as\n\"speech\" simply because it is expressed in the language of\ncomputer code. Mathematical formulae and musical scores are\nwritten in \"code,\" i.e., symbolic notations not comprehensible to\nthe uninitiated, and yet both are covered by the First Amendment.\nIf someone chose to write a novel entirely in computer object code\nby using strings of 1's and 0's for each letter of each word, the\n-37\n\nresulting work would be no different for constitutional purposes\nthan if it had been written in English. The \"object code\" version\nwould be incomprehensible to readers outside the programming\ncommunity (and tedious to read even for most within the\ncommunity), but it would be no more incomprehensible than a work\nwritten in Sanskrit for those unversed in that language. The\nundisputed evidence reveals that even pure object code can be, and\noften is, read and understood by experienced programmers. And\nsource code (in any of its various levels of complexity) can be\nread by many more. See Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 326.\nUltimately, however, the ease with which a work\nis comprehended is irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry. If\ncomputer code is distinguishable from conventional speech for\nFirst Amendment purposes, it is not because it is written in an\nobscure language. See Junger v. Daley, 209 F.3d 481, 484 (6th\nCir. 2000).\n2. Computer Programs as Speech\nOf course, computer code is not likely to be the\n-38\n\nlanguage in which a work of literature is written. Instead, it\nis primarily the language for programs executable by a computer.\nThese programs are essentially instructions to a computer.\nIn\ngeneral, programs may give instructions either to perform a task\nor series of tasks when initiated by a single (or double) click\nof a mouse or, once a program is operational (\"launched\"), to\nmanipulate data that the user enters into the computer.17 Whether\ncomputer code that gives a computer instructions is \"speech\"\nwithin the meaning of the First Amendment requires consideration\nof the scope of the Constitution's protection of speech.\nThe First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make\nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . .\" U.S. Const.\namend. I. \"Speech\" is an elusive term, and judges and scholars\nhave debated its bounds for two centuries. Some would confine\n17For example, a program (or part of a program) will give a\ncomputer the direction to \"launch\" a word-processing program like\nWordPerfect when the icon for WordPerfect is clicked; a program\nlike WordPerfect will give the computer directions to display\nletters on a screen and manipulate them according to the computer\nuser's preferences whenever the appropriate keys are struck.\n-39\n\nFirst Amendment protection to political speech. E.g., Robert Bork,\nNeutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. L.J.\n1 (1971). Others would extend it further to artistic expression.\nE.g., Marci A. Hamilton, Art Speech, 49 Vand. L. Rev. 73 (1996).\nWhatever might be the merits of these and other\napproaches, the law has not been so limited.\nEven dry\ninformation, devoid of advocacy, political relevance, or artistic\nexpression, has been accorded First Amendment protection. See\nMiller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 34 (1973) (\"The First Amendment\nprotects works which, taken as a whole, have serious literary,\nartistic, political, or scientific value . . . .\" (emphasis\nadded)); Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484 (1957) (First\nAmendment embraces \"[a]ll ideas having even the slightest\nredeeming social importance,\" including the \"'advancement of\ntruth, science, morality, and arts in general.'\" (quoting 1\nJournals of the Continental Congress 108 (1774))); Board of\nTrustees of Stanford University v. Sullivan, 773 F. Supp. 472, 474\n-40\n\n(D.D.C. 1991) (\"It is . . . settled . . . that the First Amendment\nprotects scientific expression and debate just as it protects\npolitical and artistic expression.\"); see also Kent Greenawalt,\nSpeech, Crime and the Uses of Language 85 (1989) (\"[A]ssertions\nof fact generally fall within a principle of freedom of speech\n. . . .\"); cf.

A recipe is no less \"speech\" because it calls\nfor the use of an oven, and a musical score is no less \"speech\"\nbecause it specifies performance on an electric guitar. Arguably\ndistinguishing computer programs from conventional language\ninstructions is the fact that programs are executable on a\ncomputer. But the fact that a program has the capacity to direct\nthe functioning of a computer does not mean that it lacks the\nadditional capacity to convey information, and it is the conveying\nof information that renders instructions \"speech\" for purposes of\nthe First Amendment.20\nThe information conveyed by most\n19These cases almost always concern instructions on how to\ncommit illegal acts. Several courts have concluded that such\ninstructions fall outside the First Amendment. However, these\nconclusions never rest on the fact that the speech took the form\nof instructions, but rather on the fact that the instructions\ncounseled the listener how to commit illegal acts. See, e.g., Rice\nv. Paladin Enterprises, Inc., 128 F.3d 233, 247-49 (4th Cir.\n1997); United States v. Barnett, 667 F.2d 835, 842 (9th Cir.\n1982). None of these opinions even hints that instructions are\na form of speech categorically outside the First Amendment.\n20Of course, we do not mean to suggest that the communication\nof \"information\" is a prerequisite of protected \"speech.\"\nProtected speech may communicate, among other things, ideas,\nemotions, or thoughts. We identify \"information\" only because\nthis is what computer programs most often communicate, in addition\n-43\n\n\"instructions\" is how to perform a task.\nInstructions such as computer code, which are intended\nto be executable by a computer, will often convey information\ncapable\nof comprehension and assessment by a human being.21 A programmer\nreading a program learns information about instructing a computer,\nand might use this information to improve personal programming\nskills and perhaps the craft of programming.\nMoreover,\nprogrammers communicating ideas to one another almost inevitably\ncommunicate in code, much as musicians use notes.22\nLimiting\nto giving directions to a computer.\n21However, in the rare case where a human's mental faculties\ndo not intercede in executing the instructions, we have withheld\nprotection. See Vartuli, 228 F.3d at 111.\n22Programmers use snippets of code to convey their ideas for\nnew programs; economists and other creators of computer models\npublish the code of their models in order to demonstrate the\nmodels' vigor.

United States Department of Justice, 176 F.3d\n1132, 1141 (9th Cir.)

Instructions that communicate\ninformation comprehensible to a human qualify as speech whether\nthe instructions are designed for execution by a computer or a\nhuman (or both).\nVartuli is not to the contrary.\nThe defendants in\n23Reinforcing the conclusion that software programs qualify\nas \"speech\" for First Amendment purposes--even though they\ninstruct computers--is the accelerated blurring of the line\nbetween \"source code\" and conventional \"speech.\" There already\nexist programs capable of translating English descriptions of a\nprogram into source code. Trial Tr. at 1101-02 (Testimony of\nProfessor\nAndrew\nAppel).\nThese\nprograms\nare\nfunctionally\nindistinguishable from the compilers that routinely translate\nsource code into object code.\nThese new programs (still\napparently rudimentary) hold the potential for turning \"prose\"\ninstructions on how to write a computer program into the program\nitself. Even if there were an argument for exempting the latter\nfrom First Amendment protection, the former are clearly protected\nfor the reasons set forth in the text. As technology becomes more\nsophisticated, instructions to other humans will increasingly be\nexecutable by computers as well.\n-45\n\nVartuli marketed a software program called \"Recurrence,\" which\nwould tell computer users when to buy or sell currency futures\ncontracts if their computers were fed currency market rates. The\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission charged the defendants with\nviolating federal law for, among other things, failing to register\nas commodity trading advisors for their distribution of the\nRecurrence software. The defendants maintained that Recurrence's\ncues to users to buy or sell were protected speech, and that the\nregistration\nrequirement as applied to Recurrence was a constitutionally\nsuspect\nprior\nrestraint.\nWe\nrejected\nthe\ndefendants'\nconstitutional claim, holding that Recurrence \"in the form it was\nsold and marketed by the defendants\" did not generate speech\nprotected by the First Amendment. Vartuli, 228 F.3d at 111.\nEssential to our ruling in Vartuli was the manner in\nwhich the defendants marketed the software and intended that it\n-46\n\nbe used: the defendants told users of the software to follow the\nsoftware's cues \"with no second-guessing,\" id., and intended that\nusers follow Recurrence's commands \"mechanically\" and \"without the\nintercession of the mind or the will of the recipient,\" id. We\nheld that the values served by the First Amendment were not\nadvanced by these instructions, even though the instructions were\nexpressed in words. Id.\nWe acknowledged that some users would,\ndespite the defendants' marketing, refuse to follow Recurrence's\ncues mechanically but instead would use the commands as a source\nof information and advice, and that, as to these users,\nRecurrence's cues might very\n\"well have been 'speech.'\" Id. at 111-12.\nNevertheless, we\nconcluded that the Government could require registration for\nRecurrence's intended use because such use was devoid of any\nconstitutionally protected speech. Id. at 112.\nVartuli considered two ways in which a programmer might\nbe said to communicate through code: to the user of the program\n(not\nnecessarily\nprotected)\nand\nto\nthe\ncomputer\n(never\n-47\n\nprotected).24 However, this does not mean that Vartuli denied\nFirst Amendment protection to all computer programs. Since\nVartuli limited its constitutional scrutiny to the code \"as\nmarketed,\" i.e., as an automatic trading system, it did not have\noccasion to consider a third manner in which a programmer might\ncommunicate through code: to another programmer.\nFor all of these reasons, we join the other courts that\nhave concluded that computer code, and computer programs\nconstructed from code can merit First Amendment protection, see\nJunger, 209 F.3d at 484;25 Bernstein, 922 F. Supp. at 1434-36; see\n24Vartuli reasoned that the interaction between \"programming\ncommands as triggers and semiconductors as a conduit,\" even though\ncommunication, is not \"speech\" within the meaning of the First\nAmendment and that the communication between Recurrence and a\ncustomer using it as intended was similarly not \"speech.\" Vartuli,\n228 F.2d at 111.\n25The reasoning of Junger has recently been criticized. See\nOrin S. Kerr, Are We Overprotecting Code? Thoughts on First-\nGeneration Internet Law, 57 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1287 (2000).\nProf. Kerr apprehends that if encryption code is First Amendment\nspeech because it conveys \"ideas about cryptography,\" Junger, 209\nF.3d at 484, all code will be protected \"because code will always\nconvey information about itself.\" Kerr, supra, at 1291. That\nshould not suffice, he argues, because handing someone an object,\nfor example, a padlock, is a good way of communicating how that\nobject works, yet a padlock is not speech. Id. at 1291-92.\n-48\n\nalso Bernstein, 176 F.3d at 1140-41; Karn v. United States\nDepartment of State, 925 F. Supp. 1, 9-10 (D.D.C. 1996) (assuming,\nwithout deciding, that source code with English comments\ninterspersed throughout is \"speech\"), although the scope of such\nprotection remains to be determined.\n3. The Scope of First Amendment Protection for Computer\nCode\nHaving\nconcluded\nthat\ncomputer\ncode\nconveying\ninformation is \"speech\" within the meaning of the First Amendment,\nwe next consider, to a limited extent, the scope of the protection\nthat code enjoys. As the District Court recognized, Universal I,\n111 F.

Both code and a\npadlock can convey information, but only code, because it uses a\nnotational system comprehensible by humans, is communication that\nqualifies as speech. Prof. Kerr might be right that making the\ncommunication of ideas or information the test of whether code is\nspeech provides First Amendment coverage to many, perhaps most,\ncomputer programs, but that is a consequence of the information-\nconveying capacity of the programs, not a reason for denying them\nFirst Amendment coverage.\n-49\n\nof the content of the speech. Content-based restrictions are\npermissible only if they serve compelling state interests and do\nso by the least restrictive means available.\nSee Sable\nCommunications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126\n(1989). A content-neutral restriction is permissible if it serves\na substantial governmental interest, the interest is unrelated to\nthe suppression of free expression, and the regulation is narrowly\ntailored, which \"in this context requires . . . that the means\nchosen do not 'burden substantially more speech than is necessary\nto further the government's legitimate interests.'\" Turner\nBroadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 662 (1994)\n(quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799 (1989)).26\n26The Supreme Court has used slightly different formulations\nto express the narrow tailoring requirement of a content-neutral\nregulation. In O'Brien, the formulation was \"if the incidental\nrestriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than\nis essential to the furtherance of that interest.\" 391 U.S. at\n377.\nIn Ward, the formulation was \"'so long as the . . .\nregulation promotes a substantial government interest that would\nbe achieved less effectively absent the regulation.'\" 491 U.S. at\n799 (quoting United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 689\n(1985)). Ward added, however, that the regulation may not \"burden\nsubstantially more speech than is necessary to further the\ngovernment's legitimate interests.\" Id. (emphasis added). Turner\n-50\n\n\"[G]overnment regulation of expressive activity is\n'content neutral' if it is justified without reference to the\ncontent of regulated speech.\" Hill v.

A regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the\ncontent of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an\nincidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\"\nWard, 491 U.S. at 791.\nThe Supreme Court's approach to\ndetermining content-neutrality appears to be applicable whether\nwhat is regulated is expression, see id. at 791-93 (regulation of\nvolume of music), conduct, see O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377, or any\n\"activity\" that can be said to combine speech and non-speech\nelements, see Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11 (1974)\nBroadcasting quoted both the \"no greater than is essential\"\nformulation from O'Brien, see Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S. at\n662, and the \"would be achieved less effectively\" formulation from\nWard, see id.\nTurner Broadcasting made clear that the narrow\ntailoring requirement is less demanding than the least restrictive\nmeans requirement of a content-specific regulation, id., and\nappears to have settled on the \"substantially more\" phrasing from\nWard as the formulation that best expresses the requirement, id.\nThat is the formulation we will apply.\n-51\n\n(applying O'Brien to \"activity\" of displaying American flag hung\nupside down and decorated with a peace symbol).\nTo determine whether regulation of computer code is\ncontent-neutral, the initial inquiry must be whether the regulated\nactivity is \"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication\nto fall within the scope of the First . . . Amendment[].\" Id. at\n409; see also Name.Space, 202 F.3d at 585. Computer code, as we\nhave noted, often conveys information comprehensible to human\nbeings, even as it also directs a computer to perform various\nfunctions. Once a speech component is identified, the inquiry\nthen proceeds to whether the regulation is \"justified without\nreference to the content of regulated speech.\" Hill, 530 U.S. at\n720.\nThe Appellants vigorously reject the idea that computer\ncode can be regulated according to any different standard than\nthat applicable to pure speech, i.e., speech that lacks a\nnonspeech component. Although recognizing that code is a series\nof instructions to a computer, they argue that code is no\n-52\n\ndifferent, for First Amendment purposes, than blueprints that\ninstruct an engineer or recipes that instruct a cook. See\nSupplemental Brief for Appellants at 2, 3.27 We disagree. Unlike\na blueprint or a recipe, which cannot yield any functional result\nwithout human comprehension of its content, human decision-making,\nand human action, computer code can instantly cause a computer to\naccomplish tasks and instantly render the results of those tasks\navailable throughout the world via the Internet. The only human\naction required to achieve these results can be as limited and\ninstantaneous as a single click of a mouse. These realities of\nwhat code is and what its normal functions are require a First\nAmendment analysis that treats code as combining nonspeech and\nspeech elements, i.e., functional and expressive elements. See\nRed Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 386 (1969)\n(\"[D]ifferences in the characteristics of new media justify\n27This argument is elaborated by some of the amici curiae.\n\"In the absence of human intervention, code does not function, it\nengages in no conduct. It is as passive as a cake recipe.\" Brief\nof Amici Curiae Dr. Harold Abelson et al. at 26.\n-53\n\ndifferences in the First Amendment standards applied to them.\"\n(footnote omitted)).\nWe recognize, as did Judge Kaplan, that the functional\ncapability of computer code cannot yield a result until a human\nbeing decides to insert the disk containing the code into a\ncomputer and causes it to perform its function (or programs a\ncomputer\nto\ncause\nthe\ncode\nto\nperform\nits\nfunction).\nNevertheless, this momentary intercession of human action does not\ndiminish the nonspeech component of code, nor render code entirely\nspeech, like a blueprint or a recipe. Judge Kaplan, in a passage\nthat merits extensive quotation, cogently explained why this is\nespecially so with respect to decryption code:\n[T]he focus on functionality in order to\ndetermine the level of scrutiny is not an\ninevitable consequence of the speech-conduct\ndistinction. Conduct has immediate effects on\nthe environment. Computer code, on the other\nhand, no matter how functional, causes a\ncomputer to perform the intended operations\nonly if someone uses the code to do so.\nHence, one commentator, in a thoughtful\narticle, has maintained that functionality is\nreally \"a proxy for effects or harm\" and that\nits adoption as a determinant of the level of\nscrutiny slides over questions of causation\n-54\n\nthat intervene between the dissemination of a\ncomputer program and any harm caused by its\nuse.\nThe characterization of functionality as\na proxy for the consequences of use is\naccurate. But the assumption that the chain\nof causation is too attenuated to justify the\nuse of functionality to determine the level of\nscrutiny, at least in this context, is not.\nSociety\nincreasingly\ndepends\nupon\ntechnological means of controlling access to\ndigital files and systems, whether they are\nmilitary computers, bank records, academic\nrecords, copyrighted works or something else\nentirely. There are far too many who, given\nany\nopportunity,\nwill\nbypass\nsecurity\nmeasures, some for the sheer joy of doing it,\nsome for innocuous reasons, and others for\nmore malevolent purposes. Given the virtually\ninstantaneous and worldwide dissemination\nwidely available via the Internet, the only\nrational assumption is that once a computer\nprogram capable of bypassing such an access\ncontrol system is disseminated, it will be\nused. And that is not all.\nThere\nwas\na\ntime\nwhen\ncopyright\ninfringement could be dealt with quite\nadequately by focusing on the infringing act.\nIf someone wished to make and sell high\nquality\nbut\nunauthorized\ncopies\nof\na\ncopyrighted book, for example, the infringer\nneeded a printing press.\nThe copyright\nholder, once aware of the appearance of\ninfringing copies, usually was able to trace\nthe copies up the chain of distribution, find\nand prosecute the infringer, and shut off the\ninfringement at the source.\n-55\n\nIn principle, the digital world is very\ndifferent.\nOnce a decryption program like\nDeCSS is written, it quickly can be sent all\nover the world. Every recipient is capable\nnot only of decrypting and perfectly copying\nplaintiffs' copyrighted DVDs, but also of\nretransmitting perfect copies of DeCSS and\nthus enabling every recipient to do the same.\nThey likewise are capable of transmitting\nperfect copies of the decrypted DVD.\nThe\nprocess potentially is exponential rather than\nlinear.\n. . .\nThese considerations drastically alter\nconsideration of the causal link between\ndissemination of computer programs such as\nthis and their illicit use. Causation in the\nlaw ultimately involves practical policy\njudgments. Here, dissemination itself carries\nvery substantial risk of imminent harm because\nthe\nmechanism\nis\nso\nunusual\nby\nwhich\ndissemination of means of circumventing access\ncontrols to copyrighted works threatens to\nproduce virtually unstoppable infringement of\ncopyright. In consequence, the causal link\nbetween the dissemination of circumvention\ncomputer programs and their improper use is\nmore than sufficiently close to warrant\nselection of a level of constitutional\nscrutiny based on the programs' functionality.\nUniversal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 331-32 (footnotes omitted). The\nfunctionality of computer code properly affects the scope of its\nFirst Amendment protection.\n4.\nThe Scope of First Amendment Protection for\n-56\n\nDecryption Code\nIn considering the scope of First Amendment protection\nfor a decryption program like DeCSS, we must recognize that the\nessential purpose of encryption code is to prevent unauthorized\naccess. Owners of all property rights are entitled to prohibit\naccess to their property by unauthorized persons. Homeowners can\ninstall locks on the doors of their houses. Custodians of\nvaluables can place them in safes. Stores can attach to products\nsecurity devices that will activate alarms if the products are\ntaken away without purchase. These and similar security devices\ncan be circumvented. Burglars can use skeleton keys to open door\nlocks. Thieves can obtain the combinations to safes.\nProduct\nsecurity devices can be neutralized.\nOur case concerns a security device, CSS computer code,\nthat prevents access by unauthorized persons to DVD movies. The\nCSS code is embedded in the DVD movie. Access to the movie cannot\nbe obtained unless a person has a device, a licensed DVD player,\nequipped with computer code capable of decrypting the CSS\n-57\n\nencryption code. In its basic function, CSS is like a lock on a\nhomeowner's door, a combination of a safe, or a security device\nattached to a store's products.\nDeCSS is computer code that can decrypt CSS. In its\nbasic function, it is like a skeleton key that can open a locked\ndoor, a combination that can open a safe, or a device that can\nneutralize the security device attached to a store's products.28\nDeCSS enables anyone to gain access to a DVD movie without using\na DVD player.\nThe initial use of DeCSS to gain access to a DVD movie\ncreates no loss to movie producers because the initial user must\npurchase the DVD. However, once the DVD is purchased, DeCSS\nenables the initial user to copy the movie in digital form and\ntransmit it instantly in virtually limitless quantity, thereby\ndepriving the movie producer of sales. The advent of the Internet\ncreates the potential for instantaneous worldwide distribution of\n28More dramatically, the Government calls DeCSS \"a digital\ncrowbar.\" Brief for Intervenor United States at 19.\n-58\n\nthe copied material.\nAt first glance, one might think that Congress has as\nmuch authority to regulate the distribution of computer code to\ndecrypt DVD movies as it has to regulate distribution of skeleton\nkeys, combinations to safes, or devices to neutralize store\nproduct security devices. However, despite the evident legitimacy\nof protection against unauthorized access to DVD movies, just like\nany other property, regulation of decryption code like DeCSS is\nchallenged in this case because DeCSS differs from a skeleton key\nin one important respect: it not only is capable of performing the\nfunction of unlocking the encrypted DVD movie, it also is a form\nof communication, albeit written in a language not understood by\nthe general public.\nAs a communication, the DeCSS code has a\nclaim to being \"speech,\" and as \"speech,\" it has a claim to being\nprotected by the First Amendment. But just as the realities of\nwhat any computer code can accomplish must inform the scope of its\nconstitutional protection, so the capacity of a decryption program\nlike DeCSS to accomplish unauthorized--indeed, unlawful--access\n-59\n\nto materials in which the Plaintiffs have intellectual property\nrights must inform and limit the scope of its First Amendment\nprotection. Cf. Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 386 (\"[D]ifferences in the\ncharacteristics of new media justify differences in the First\nAmendment standards applied to them.\").\nWith all of the foregoing considerations in mind, we\nnext consider the Appellants' First Amendment challenge to the\nDMCA as applied in the specific prohibitions that have been\nimposed by the District Court's injunction.\nB. First Amendment Challenge\nThe District Court's injunction applies the DMCA to the\nDefendants by imposing two types of prohibition, both grounded on\nthe anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA. The first prohibits\nposting DeCSS or any other technology for circumventing CSS on any\nInternet web site. Universal II, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 346-47, ¶\n1(a), (b). The second prohibits knowingly linking any Internet\nweb site to any other web site containing DeCSS. Id. at 347, ¶\n1(c). The validity of the posting and linking prohibitions must\n-60\n\nbe considered separately.\n-61\n\n1. Posting\nThe initial issue is whether the posting prohibition is\ncontent-neutral, since, as we have explained, this classification\ndetermines the applicable constitutional standard. The Appellants\ncontend that the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA and their\napplication by means of the posting prohibition of the injunction\nare content-based. They argue that the provisions \"specifically\ntarget . . . scientific expression based on the particular topic\naddressed by that expression--namely, techniques for circumventing\nCSS.\" Supplemental Brief for Appellants at 1. We disagree. The\nAppellants' argument fails to recognize that the target of the\nposting provisions of the injunction--DeCSS--has both a nonspeech\nand a speech component, and that the DMCA, as applied to the\nAppellants, and the posting prohibition of the injunction target\nonly the nonspeech component. Neither the DMCA nor the posting\nprohibition is concerned with whatever capacity DeCSS might have\nfor conveying information to a human being, and that capacity, as\npreviously explained, is what arguably creates a speech component\n-62\n\nof the decryption code. The DMCA and the posting prohibition are\napplied to DeCSS solely because of its capacity to instruct a\ncomputer to decrypt CSS. That functional capability is not speech\nwithin the meaning of the First Amendment. The Government seeks\nto \"justif[y],\" Hill, 530 U.S. at 720, both the application of the\nDMCA and the posting prohibition to the Appellants solely on the\nbasis of the functional capability of DeCSS to instruct a computer\nto decrypt CSS, i.e., \"without reference to the content of the\nregulated speech,\" id.\nThis type of regulation is therefore\ncontent-neutral, just as would be a restriction on trafficking in\nskeleton keys identified because of their capacity to unlock jail\ncells, even though some of the keys happened to bear a slogan or\nother legend that qualified as a speech component.\nAs a content-neutral regulation with an incidental\neffect on a speech component, the regulation must serve a\nsubstantial governmental interest, the interest must be unrelated\nto the suppression of free expression, and the incidental\nrestriction on speech must not burden substantially more speech\n-63\n\nthan is necessary to further that interest. Turner Broadcasting,\n512 U.S. at 662.\nThe Government's interest in preventing\nunauthorized access to encrypted copyrighted material is\nunquestionably substantial, and the regulation of DeCSS by the\nposting prohibition plainly serves that interest. Moreover, that\ninterest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The\ninjunction regulates the posting of DeCSS, regardless of whether\nDeCSS code contains any information comprehensible by human beings\nthat would qualify as speech. Whether the incidental regulation\non speech burdens substantially more speech than is necessary to\nfurther the interest in preventing unauthorized access to\ncopyrighted materials requires some elaboration.\nPosting DeCSS on the Appellants' web site makes it\ninstantly available at the click of a mouse to any person in the\nworld with access to the Internet, and such person can then\ninstantly transmit DeCSS to anyone else with Internet access.\nAlthough the prohibition on posting prevents the Appellants from\nconveying to others the speech component of DeCSS, the Appellants\n-64\n\nhave not suggested, much less shown, any technique for barring\nthem from making this instantaneous worldwide distribution of a\ndecryption code that makes a lesser restriction on the code's\nspeech component.29\nIt is true that the Government has\nalternative\nmeans\nof\nprohibiting\nunauthorized\naccess\nto\ncopyrighted materials. For example, it can create criminal and\n29Briefs of some of the amici curiae discuss the possibility\nof adequate protection against copying of copyrighted materials\nby adopting the approach of the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992,\n17 U.S.C. § 1002(a), which requires digital audio tape recorders\nto include a technology that prevents serial copying, but permits\nmaking a single copy. See, e.g., Brief of Amici Curiae Benkler\nand Lessig at 15. However, the Defendants did not present\nevidence of the current feasibility of a similar solution to\nprevent serial copying of DVDs over the Internet. Even if the\nGovernment, in defending the DMCA, must sustain a burden of proof\nin order to satisfy the standards for content-neutral regulation,\nthe Defendants must adduce enough evidence to create fact issues\nconcerning\nthe\ncurrent\navailability\nof\nless\nintrusive\ntechnological solutions. They did not do so in the District\nCourt.\nMoreover, we note that when Congress opted for the\nsolution to serial copying of digital audio tapes, it imposed a\nspecial royalty on manufacturers of digital audio recording\ndevices to be distributed to appropriate copyright holders. See\n17 U.S.C. §§ 1003-1007. We doubt if the First Amendment required\nCongress to adopt a similar technology/royalty scheme for\nregulating the copying of DVDs, but in any event the record in\nthis case provides no basis for invalidating the anti-trafficking\nprovisions of the DMCA or the injunction for lack of such an\nalternative approach.\n-65\n\ncivil liability for those who gain unauthorized access, and thus\nit can be argued that the restriction on posting DeCSS is not\nabsolutely necessary to preventing unauthorized access to\ncopyrighted materials. But a content-neutral regulation need not\nemploy the least restrictive means of accomplishing the\ngovernmental objective. Id.\nIt need only avoid burdening\n\"substantially more speech than is necessary to further the\ngovernment's legitimate interests.\" Id. (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted). The prohibition on the Defendants' posting\nof DeCSS satisfies that standard.30\n2. Linking\nIn considering linking, we need to clarify the sense in\nwhich the injunction prohibits such activity. Although the\n30We have considered the opinion of a California intermediate\nappellate court in DVD Copy Control Ass'n v. Bunner, No. H021153,\n2001 WL 1340619 (Cal. Ct. App., 6th Dist. Nov. 1, 2001),\ndeclining, on First Amendment grounds, to issue a preliminary\ninjunction under state trade secrets law prohibiting a web site\noperator from posting DeCSS. To the extent that DVD Copy Control\ndisagrees with our First Amendment analysis, we decline to follow\nit.\n-66\n\ninjunction defines several terms, it does not define \"linking.\"\nNevertheless, it is evident from the District Court's opinion that\nit is concerned with \"hyperlinks,\" Universal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d\nat 307; see id. at 339.31 A hyperlink is a cross-reference (in a\ndistinctive font or color) appearing on one web page that, when\nactivated by the point-and-click of a mouse, brings onto the\ncomputer screen another web page. The hyperlink can appear on a\nscreen (window) as text, such as the Internet address (\"URL\") of\nthe web page being called up or a word or phrase that identifies\nthe web page to be called up, for example, \"DeCSS web site.\" Or\nthe hyperlink can appear as an image, for example, an icon\ndepicting a person sitting at a computer watching a DVD movie and\ntext stating \"click here to access DeCSS and see DVD movies for\nfree!\"\nThe code for the web page containing the hyperlink\ncontains a computer instruction that associates the link with the\nURL of the web page to be accessed, such that clicking on the\n31\"Hyperlinks\" are also called \"hypertext links\" or \"active\nlinks.\"\n-67\n\nhyperlink instructs the computer to enter the URL of the desired\nweb page and thereby access that page. With a hyperlink on a web\npage, the linked web site is just one click away.32\nIn applying the DMCA to linking (via hyperlinks), Judge\nKaplan recognized, as he had with DeCSS code, that a hyperlink has\nboth a speech and a nonspeech component. It conveys information,\nthe Internet address of the linked web page, and has the\nfunctional capacity to bring the content of the linked web page\nto the user's computer screen (or, as Judge Kaplan put it, to\n\"take one almost instantaneously to the desired destination.\"\nId.). As he had ruled with respect to DeCSS code, he ruled that\napplication of the DMCA to the Defendants' linking to web sites\ncontaining DeCSS is content-neutral because it is justified\n32\"Linking\" not accomplished by a hyperlink would simply\ninvolve the posting of the Internet address (\"URL\") of another web\npage. A \"link\" of this sort is sometimes called an \"inactive\nlink.\" With an inactive link, the linked web page would be only\nfour clicks away, one click to select the URL address for copying,\none click to copy the address, one click to \"paste\" the address\ninto the text box for URL addresses, and one click (or striking\nthe \"enter\" key) to instruct the computer to call up the linked\nweb site.\n-68\n\nwithout regard to the speech component of the hyperlink. Id. The\nlinking prohibition applies whether or not the hyperlink contains\nany information, comprehensible to a human being, as to the\nInternet address of the web page being accessed. The linking\nprohibition is justified solely by the functional capability of\nthe hyperlink.\nApplying\nthe\nO'Brien/Ward/Turner\nBroadcasting\nrequirements for content-neutral regulation, Judge Kaplan then\nruled that the DMCA, as applied to the Defendants' linking, served\nsubstantial governmental interests and was unrelated to the\nsuppression of free expression. Id. We agree. He then carefully\nconsidered the \"closer call,\" id., as to whether a linking\nprohibition would satisfy the narrow tailoring requirement. In\nan especially carefully considered portion of his opinion, he\nobserved that strict liability for linking to web sites containing\nDeCSS would risk two impairments of free expression. Web site\noperators would be inhibited from displaying links to various web\npages for fear that a linked page might contain DeCSS, and a\n-69\n\nprohibition on linking to a web site containing DeCSS would\ncurtail access to whatever other information was contained at the\naccessed site. Id. at 340.\nTo avoid applying the DMCA in a manner that would\n\"burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the\ngovernment's legitimate interests,\" Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S.\nat 662 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), Judge\nKaplan adapted the standards of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,\n376 U.S. 254, 283 (1964), to fashion a limited prohibition against\nlinking to web sites containing DeCSS. He required clear and\nconvincing evidence\nthat those responsible for the link (a) know\nat the relevant time that the offending\nmaterial is on the linked-to site, (b) know\nthat it is circumvention technology that may\nnot lawfully be offered, and (c) create or\nmaintain\nthe\nlink\nfor\nthe\npurpose\nof\ndisseminating that technology.\nUniversal I, 111 F. Supp. 2d at 341. He then found that the\nevidence satisfied his three-part test by his required standard\nof proof. Id.\n-70\n\nIn response to our post-argument request for the\nparties' views on various issues, including specifically Judge\nKaplan's test for a linking prohibition, the Appellants replied\nthat his test was deficient for not requiring proof of intent to\ncause, or aid or abet, harm, and that the only valid test for a\nlinking prohibition would be one that could validly apply to the\npublication in a print medium of an address for obtaining\nprohibited material. Supplemental Brief for Appellants at 14. The\nAppellees and the Government accepted Judge Kaplan's criteria for\npurposes of asserting the validity of the injunction as applied\nto the Appellants, with the Government expressing reservations as\nto the standard of clear and convincing evidence. Supplemental\nBrief for Appellees at 22-23; Supplemental Brief for Government\nat 19-21.\nMindful of the cautious approach to First Amendment\nclaims involving computer technology expressed in Name.Space, 202\nF.3d at 584 n.11, we see no need on this appeal to determine\nwhether a test as rigorous as Judge Kaplan's is required to\n-71\n\nrespond to First Amendment objections to the linking provision of\nthe injunction that he issued.\nIt suffices to reject the\nAppellants' contention that an intent to cause harm is required\nand that linking can be enjoined only under circumstances\napplicable to a print medium. As they have throughout their\narguments, the Appellants ignore the reality of the functional\ncapacity of decryption computer code and hyperlinks to facilitate\ninstantaneous unauthorized access to copyrighted materials by\nanyone anywhere in the world. Under the circumstances amply shown\nby the record, the injunction's linking prohibition validly\nregulates the Appellants' opportunity instantly to enable anyone\nanywhere to gain unauthorized access to copyrighted movies on\nDVDs.33\nAt oral argument, we asked the Government whether its\n33We acknowledge that the prohibition on linking restricts\nmore than Corley's ability to facilitate instant access to DeCSS\non linked web sites; it also restricts his ability to facilitate\naccess to whatever protected speech is available on those sites.\nHowever, those who maintain the linked sites can instantly make\ntheir protected material available for linking by Corley by the\nsimple expedient of deleting DeCSS from their web sites.\n-72\n\nundoubted power to punish the distribution of obscene materials\nwould permit an injunction prohibiting a newspaper from printing\naddresses of bookstore locations carrying such materials. In a\nproperly cautious response, the Government stated that the answer\nwould depend on the circumstances of the publication.\nThe\nAppellants' supplemental papers enthusiastically embraced the\narguable analogy between printing bookstore addresses and\ndisplaying on a web page links to web sites at which DeCSS may be\naccessed.\nSupplemental Brief for Appellants at 14.\nThey\nconfidently asserted that publication of bookstore locations\ncarrying obscene material cannot be enjoined consistent with the\nFirst Amendment, and that a prohibition against linking to web\nsites containing DeCSS is similarly invalid. Id.\nLike many analogies posited to illuminate legal issues,\nthe bookstore analogy is helpful primarily in identifying\ncharacteristics that distinguish it from the context of the\npending dispute. If a bookstore proprietor is knowingly selling\nobscene materials, the evil of distributing such materials can be\n-73\n\nprevented by injunctive relief against the unlawful distribution\n(and similar distribution by others can be deterred by punishment\nof the distributor). And if others publish the location of the\nbookstore, preventive relief against a distributor can be\neffective before any significant distribution of the prohibited\nmaterials has occurred. The digital world, however, creates a\nvery different problem. If obscene materials are posted on one\nweb site and other sites post hyperlinks to the first site, the\nmaterials are available for instantaneous worldwide distribution\nbefore any preventive measures can be effectively taken.\nThis reality obliges courts considering First Amendment\nclaims in the context of the pending case to choose between two\nunattractive alternatives: either tolerate some impairment of\ncommunication in order to permit Congress to prohibit decryption\nthat may lawfully be prevented, or tolerate some decryption in\norder to avoid some impairment of communication. Although the\nparties dispute the extent of impairment of communication if the\ninjunction is upheld and the extent of decryption if it is\n-74\n\nvacated, and differ on the availability and effectiveness of\ntechniques for minimizing both consequences, the fundamental\nchoice between impairing some communication and tolerating\ndecryption cannot be entirely avoided.\nIn facing this choice, we are mindful that it is not for\nus to resolve the issues of public policy implicated by the choice\nwe have identified. Those issues are for Congress. Our task is\nto determine whether the legislative solution adopted by Congress,\nas applied to the Appellants by the District Court's injunction,\nis consistent with the limitations of the First Amendment, and we\nare satisfied that it is.\nIV. Constitutional Challenge Based on Claimed Restriction of Fair\nUse\nAsserting that fair use \"is rooted in and required by\nboth the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment,\" Brief for\nAppellants at 42, the Appellants contend that the DMCA, as applied\nby the District Court, unconstitutionally \"eliminates fair use\"\nof copyrighted materials, id. at 41 (emphasis added). We reject\n-75\n\nthis extravagant claim.\nPreliminarily, we note that the Supreme Court has never\nheld that fair use is constitutionally required, although some\nisolated statements in its opinions might arguably be enlisted for\nsuch a requirement. In Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 (1990),\ncited by the Appellants, the Court merely noted that fair use\n\"'permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright\nstatute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity\nwhich that law is designed to foster,'\" id. (quoting Iowa State\nUniversity Research Foundation, Inc. v. American Broadcasting\nCos., 621 F.2d 57, 60 (2d Cir. 1980)); see also Harper & Row,\nPublishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 560 (1985)\n(noting \"the First Amendment protections already embodied in the\nCopyright Act's distinction between copyrightable expression and\nuncopyrightable facts and ideas, and the latitude for scholarship\nand comment traditionally afforded by fair use\"). In Campbell v.\nAcuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994), the Court observed,\n\"From the infancy of copyright protection, some opportunity for\n-76\n\nfair use of copyrighted materials has been thought necessary to\nfulfill copyright's very purpose, '[t]o promote the Progress of\nScience and useful Arts . . . .'\"34 Id. at 575 (citation omitted);\nsee generally William F. Patry, The Fair Use Privilege in\nCopyright Law 573-82 (2d ed. 1995) (questioning First Amendment\nprotection for fair use).\nWe need not explore the extent to which fair use might\nhave constitutional protection, grounded on either the First\nAmendment or the Copyright Clause, because whatever validity a\nconstitutional claim might have as to an application of the DMCA\nthat impairs fair use of copyrighted materials, such matters are\nfar beyond the scope of this lawsuit for several reasons. In the\nfirst place, the Appellants do not claim to be making fair use of\nany copyrighted materials, and nothing in the injunction prohibits\n34Although we have recognized that the First Amendment\nprovides no entitlement to use copyrighted materials beyond that\naccorded by the privilege of fair use, except in \"an extraordinary\ncase,\" Twin Peaks Productions, Inc. v. Publications International,\nLtd., 996 F.2d 1366, 1378 (2d Cir. 1993), we have not ruled that\nthe Constitution guarantees any particular formulation or minimum\navailability of the fair use defense.\n-77\n\nthem from making such fair use. They are barred from trafficking\nin a decryption code that enables unauthorized access to\ncopyrighted materials.\nSecond, as the District Court properly noted, to\nwhatever extent the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA might\nprevent others from copying portions of DVD movies in order to\nmake fair use of them, \"the evidence as to the impact of the anti-\ntrafficking provision[s] of the DMCA on prospective fair users is\nscanty and fails adequately to address the issues.\" Universal I,\n111 F. Supp. 2d at 338 n.246.\nThird, the Appellants have provided no support for their\npremise that fair use of DVD movies is constitutionally required\nto be made by copying the original work in its original format.35\nTheir examples of the fair uses that they believe others will be\n35As expressed in their supplemental papers, the position of\nthe Appellants is that \"fair use extends to works in whatever form\nthey are offered to the public,\" Supplemental Brief for Appellants\nat 20, by which we understand the Appellants to contend not merely\nthat fair use may be made of DVD movies but that the fair user\nmust be permitted access to the digital version of the DVD in\norder to directly copy excerpts for fair use in a digital format.\n-78\n\nprevented from making all involve copying in a digital format\nthose portions of a DVD movie amenable to fair use, a copying that\nwould enable the fair user to manipulate the digitally copied\nportions. One example is that of a school child who wishes to\ncopy images from a DVD movie to insert into the student's\ndocumentary film. We know of no authority for the proposition\nthat fair use, as protected by the Copyright Act, much less the\nConstitution, guarantees copying by the optimum method or in the\nidentical format of the original.\nAlthough the Appellants\ninsisted at oral argument that they should not be relegated to a\n\"horse and buggy\" technique in making fair use of DVD movies,36\nthe DMCA does not impose even an arguable limitation on the\nopportunity to make a variety of traditional fair uses of DVD\nmovies, such as commenting on their content, quoting excerpts from\ntheir screenplays, and even recording portions of the video images\n36In their supplemental papers, the Appellants contend, rather\nhyperbolically, that a prohibition on using copying machines to\nassist in making fair use of texts could not validly be upheld by\nthe availability of \"monks to scribe the relevant passages.\"\nSupplemental Brief for Appellants at 20.\n-79\n\nand sounds on film or tape by pointing a camera, a camcorder, or\na microphone at a monitor as it displays the DVD movie. The fact\nthat the resulting copy will not be as perfect or as manipulable\nas a digital copy obtained by having direct access to the DVD\nmovie in its digital form, provides no basis for a claim of\nunconstitutional limitation of fair use. A film critic making\nfair use of a movie by quoting selected lines of dialogue has no\nconstitutionally valid claim that the review (in print or on\ntelevision) would be technologically superior if the reviewer had\nnot been prevented from using a movie camera in the theater, nor\nhas an art student a valid constitutional claim to fair use of a\npainting by photographing it in a museum. Fair use has never been\nheld to be a guarantee of access to copyrighted material in order\nto copy it by the fair user's preferred technique or in the format\nof the original.\nConclusion\nWe have considered all the other arguments of the\nAppellants and conclude that they provide no basis for disturbing\n-80\n\nthe District Court's judgment. Accordingly, the judgment is\naffirmed.\n-81"

Rural Telephone Service Co.\nCertiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\nNo. 89-1909. Argued January 9, 1991 -- Decided March 27, 1991.\n916 F. 2d 718, reversed.\nRespondent Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc., is a certified public utility providing telephone service to\nseveral communities in Kansas. Pursuant to state regulation, Rural publishes a typical telephone directory, consisting\nof white pages and yellow pages. It obtains data for the directory from subscribers, who must provide their names\nand addresses to obtain telephone service. Petitioner Feist Publications, Inc., is a publishing company that specializes\nin area-wide telephone directories covering a much larger geographic range than directories such as Rural's. When\nRural refused to license its white pages listings to Feist for a directory covering 11 different telephone service areas,\nFeist extracted the listings it needed from Rural's directory without Rural's consent. Although Feist altered many\nof Rural's listings, several were identical to listings in Rural's white pages. The District Court granted summary\njudgment to Rural in its copyright infringement suit, holding that telephone directories are copyrightable. The Court\nof Appeals affirmed.\nHeld: Rural's white pages are not entitled to copyright, and therefore Feist's use of them does not constitute\ninfringement. Pp. 344-364.\n(a) Article I, § 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution mandates originality as a prerequisite for copyright protection. The\nconstitutional requirement necessitates independent creation plus a modicum of creativity. Since facts do not owe\ntheir origin to an act of authorship, they are not original and, thus, are not copyrightable. Although a compilation\nof facts may possess the requisite originality because the author typically chooses which facts to include, in what\norder to place them, and how to arrange the data so that readers may use them effectively, copyright protection\nextends only to those components of the work that are original to the author, not to the facts themselves. This\nfact/expression dichotomy severely limits the scope of protection in fact-based works. Pp. 344-351.\n(b) The Copyright Act of 1976 and its predecessor, the Copyright Act of 1909, leave no doubt that originality\nis the touchstone of copyright protection in directories and other fact-based works. The 1976 Act explains that\ncopyright extends to \"original works of authorship,\" 17 U.S.C. § 102(a), and that there can be no copyright in\nfacts, § 102(b). A compilation is not copyrightable per se, but is copyrightable only if its facts have been \"selected,\ncoordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.\"\n§ 101 (emphasis added). Thus, the statute envisions that some ways of selecting, coordinating, and arranging data\nare not sufficiently original to trigger copyright protection. Even a compilation that is copyrightable receives only\nlimited protection, for the copyright does not extend to facts contained in the compilation. § 103(b). Lower courts\nthat adopted a \"sweat of the brow\" or \"industrious collection\" test -- which extended a compilation's copyright\nprotection beyond selection and arrangement to the facts themselves -- misconstrued the 1909 Act and eschewed\nthe fundamental axiom of copyright law that no one may copyright facts or ideas. Pp. 351-361.\n(c) Rural's white pages do not meet the constitutional or statutory requirements for copyright protection. While\nRural has a valid copyright in the directory as a whole because it contains some forward text and some original\nmaterial in the yellow pages, there is nothing original in Rural's white pages. The raw data are uncopyrightable\nfacts, and the way in which Rural selected, coordinated, and arranged those facts is not original in any way. Rural's\nselection of listings -- subscribers' names, towns, and telephone numbers -- could not be more obvious and lacks\nthe modicum of creativity necessary to transform mere selection into copyrightable expression. In fact, it is plausible\nto conclude that Rural did not truly \"select\" to publish its subscribers' names and telephone numbers, since it was\nrequired to do so by state law. Moreover, there is nothing remotely creative about arranging names alphabetically\nin a white pages directory. It is an age-old practice, firmly rooted in tradition and so commonplace that it has come\nto be expected as a matter of course.

J., and White, Marshall,\nStevens, Scalia, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., joined.\nBlackmun, J., concurred in the judgment.\nThis case requires us to clarify the extent of copyright\nprotection available to telephone directory white pages.\nI\nRural Telephone Service Company, Inc., is a certified\npublic utility that provides telephone service to several\ncommunities in northwest Kansas. It is subject to a state\nregulation that requires all telephone companies operat\ning in Kansas to issue annually an updated telephone\ndirectory. Accordingly, as a condition of its monopoly\nfranchise, Rural publishes a typical telephone directory,\nconsisting of white pages and yellow pages. The white\npages list in alphabetical order the names of Rural's sub\nscribers, together with their towns and telephone num\nbers. The yellow pages list Rural's business subscribers\nalphabetically by category and feature classified adver\ntisements of various sizes. Rural distributes its directory\nfree of charge to its subscribers, but earns revenue by\nselling yellow pages advertisements.\nFeist Publications, Inc., is a publishing company that\nspecializes in area-wide telephone directories. Unlike a\ntypical directory, which covers only a particular calling\narea, Feist's area-wide directories cover a much larger\ngeographical range, reducing the need to call directory\nassistance or consult multiple directories. The Feist di\nrectory that is the subject of this litigation covers 11 dif\nferent telephone service areas in 15 counties and contains\n46,878 white pages listings -- compared to Rural's ap\nproximately 7,700 listings. Like Rural's directory, Feist's\nis distributed free of charge and includes both white pages\nand yellow pages. Feist and Rural compete vigorously for\nyellow pages advertising.\nAs the sole provider of telephone service in its service\narea, Rural obtains subscriber information quite easily.\nPersons desiring telephone service must apply to Rural\nand provide their names and addresses; Rural then as\nsigns them a telephone number. Feist is not a telephone\ncompany, let alone one with monopoly status, and there\nfore lacks independent access to any subscriber informa\ntion. To obtain white pages listings for its area-wide di\nrectory, Feist approached each of the 11 telephone com\npanies operating in northwest Kansas and offered to pay\nfor the right to use its white pages listings.\nOf the 11 telephone companies, only Rural refused to\nlicense its listings to Feist. Rural's refusal created a prob\nlem for Feist, as omitting these listings would have left\na gaping hole in its area-wide directory, rendering it less\nattractive to potential yellow pages advertisers. In a deci\nsion subsequent to that which we review here, the District\nCourt determined that this was precisely the reason Rural\nrefused to license its listings. The refusal was motivated\nby an unlawful purpose \"to extend its monopoly in tele\nphone service to a monopoly in yellow pages advertising.\"\nRural Telephone Service Co. v. Feist Publications, Inc.,\n737 F. Supp. 610, 622 (Kan. 1990).\nUnable to license Rural's white pages listings, Feist\nused them without Rural's consent. Feist began by re\nmoving several thousand listings that fell outside the ge\nographic range of its area-wide directory, then hired per\nsonnel to investigate the 4,935 that remained. These em\nployees verified the data reported by Rural and sought\nto obtain additional information. As a result, a typical\nFeist listing includes the individual's street address; most\nof Rural's listings do not. Notwithstanding these addi\ntions, however, 1,309 of the 46,878 listings in Feist's 1983\ndirectory were identical to listings in Rural's 1982-1983\nwhite pages. App. 54 (P 15-16), 57. Four of these were\nfictitious listings that Rural had inserted into its directory\nto detect copying.\nRural sued for copyright infringement in the District\nCourt for the District of Kansas taking the position that\nFeist, in compiling its own directory, could not use the\ninformation contained in Rural's white pages. Rural as\nserted that Feist's employees were obliged to travel door-\nto-door or conduct a telephone survey to discover the\nsame information for themselves. Feist responded that\nsuch efforts were economically impractical and, in any\nevent, unnecessary because the information copied was\nbeyond the scope of copyright protection. The District\nCourt granted summary judgment to Rural, explaining\nthat \"courts have consistently held that telephone direc\ntories are copyrightable\" and citing a string of lower court\ndecisions. 663 F. Supp. 214, 218 (1987). In an unpub\nlished opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Cir\ncuit affirmed \"for substantially the reasons given by the\ndistrict court.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a, judgt. order\nreported at 916 F. 2d 718 (1990). We granted certiorari,\n498 U.S. 808 (1990), to determine whether the copyright\nin Rural's directory protects the names, towns, and tele\nphone numbers copied by Feist.\nII -- A\nThis case concerns the interaction of two well-\nestablished propositions. The first is that facts are not\ncopyrightable; the other, that compilations of facts gen\nerally are. Each of these propositions possesses an im\npeccable pedigree. That there can be no valid copyright\nin facts is universally understood. The most fundamental\naxiom of copyright law is that \"no author may copyright\nhis ideas or the facts he narrates.\" Harper & Row, Pub\nlishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 556\n(1985). Rural wisely concedes this point, noting in its\nbrief that \"facts and discoveries, of course, are not them\nselves subject to copyright protection.\" Brief for Respon\ndent 24. At the same time, however, it is beyond dispute\n\nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)\nPage 3\nthat compilations of facts are within the subject matter\nof copyright. Compilations were expressly mentioned in\nthe Copyright Act of 1909, and again in the Copyright\nAct of 1976.\nThere is an undeniable tension between these two\npropositions. Many compilations consist of nothing but\nraw data -- i. e., wholly factual information not accom\npanied by any original written expression. On what basis\nmay one claim a copyright in such a work? Common sense\ntells us that 100 uncopyrightable facts do not magically\nchange their status when gathered together in one place.\nYet copyright law seems to contemplate that compilations\nthat consist exclusively of facts are potentially within its\nscope.\nThe key to resolving the tension lies in understand\ning why facts are not copyrightable. The sine qua non of\ncopyright is originality. To qualify for copyright protec\ntion, a work must be original to the author. See Harper &\nRow, supra, at 547-549. Original, as the term is used in\ncopyright, means only that the work was independently\ncreated by the author (as opposed to copied from other\nworks), and that it possesses at least some minimal de\ngree of creativity. 1 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright\n§ § 2.01[A], [B] (1990) (hereinafter Nimmer). To be sure,\nthe requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a\nslight amount will suffice. The vast majority of works\nmake the grade quite easily, as they possess some cre\native spark, \"no matter how crude, humble or obvious\"\nit might be. Id., § 1.08[C]. Originality does not signify\nnovelty; a work may be original even though it closely\nresembles other works so long as the similarity is fortu\nitous, not the result of copying. To illustrate, assume\nthat two poets, each ignorant of the other, compose iden\ntical poems. Neither work is novel, yet both are original\nand, hence, copyrightable. See Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn\nPictures Corp., 81 F. 2d 49, 54 (CA2 1936).\nOriginality is a constitutional requirement.\nThe\nsource of Congress' power to enact copyright laws is Ar\nticle I, § 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution, which authorizes\nCongress to \"secure for limited Times to Authors . . . the\nexclusive Right to their respective Writings.\" In two de\ncisions from the late 19th century -- The Trade-Mark\nCases, 100 U.S. 82 (1879); and Burrow-Giles Litho\ngraphic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.S. 53 (1884) -- this Court\ndefined the crucial terms \"authors\" and \"writings.\" In so\ndoing, the Court made it unmistakably clear that these\nterms presuppose a degree of originality.\nIn The Trade-Mark Cases, the Court addressed the\nconstitutional scope of \"writings.\" For a particular work\nto be classified \"under the head of writings of authors,\"\nthe Court determined, \"originality is required.\" 100 U.S.,\nat 94. The Court explained that originality requires in\ndependent creation plus a modicum of creativity: \"While\nthe word writings may be liberally construed, as it has\nbeen, to include original designs for engraving, prints,\n&c., it is only such as are original, and are founded in the\ncreative powers of the mind. The writings which are to\nbe protected are the fruits of intellectual labor, embodied\nin the form of books, prints, engravings, and the like.\"\nIbid. (emphasis in original).\nIn Burrow-Giles, the Court distilled the same require\nment from the Constitution's use of the word \"authors.\"\nThe Court defined \"author,\" in a constitutional sense, to\nmean \"he to whom anything owes its origin; originator;\nmaker.\" 111 U.S., at 58 (internal quotation marks omit\nted). As in The Trade-Mark Cases, the Court empha\nsized the creative component of originality. It described\ncopyright as being limited to \"original intellectual con\nceptions of the author,\" 111 U.S., at 58, and stressed the\nimportance of requiring an author who accuses another of\ninfringement to prove \"the existence of those facts of orig\ninality, of intellectual production, of thought, and concep\ntion.\" Id., at 59-60.\nThe originality requirement articulated in The Trade-\nMark Cases and Burrow-Giles remains the touchstone of\ncopyright protection today. See Goldstein v. California,\n412 U.S. 546, 561-562 (1973). It is the very \"premise of\ncopyright law.\" Miller v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,\n650 F. 2d 1365, 1368 (CA5 1981). Leading scholars\nagree on this point. As one pair of commentators suc\ncinctly puts it: \"The originality requirement is constitu\ntionally mandated for all works.\" Patterson & Joyce, Mo\nnopolizing the Law: The Scope of Copyright Protection\nfor Law Reports and Statutory Compilations, 36 UCLA\nL. Rev. 719, 763, n. 155 (1989) (emphasis in original)\n(hereinafter Patterson & Joyce). Accord, id., at 759-760,\nand n. 140; Nimmer § 1.06[A] (\"Originality is a statutory\nas well as a constitutional requirement\"); id., § 1.08[C]\n(\"[A] modicum of intellectual labor . . . clearly constitutes\nan essential constitutional element\").\nIt is this bedrock principle of copyright that mandates\nthe law's seemingly disparate treatment of facts and fac\ntual compilations. \"No one may claim originality as to\nfacts.\" Id., § 2.11[A], p. 2-157. This is because facts\ndo not owe their origin to an act of authorship. The\ndistinction is one between creation and discovery: The\nfirst person to find and report a particular fact has not\ncreated the fact; he or she has merely discovered its exis\ntence. To borrow from Burrow-Giles, one who discovers\na fact is not its \"maker\" or \"originator.\" 111 U.S., at\n58. \"The discoverer merely finds and records.\" Nimmer\n§ 2.03[E]. Census takers, for example, do not \"create\"\nthe population figures that emerge from their efforts; in\na sense, they copy these figures from the world around\nthem. Denicola, Copyright in Collections of Facts: A\nTheory for the Protection of Nonfiction Literary Works,\n81 Colum. L. Rev. 516, 525 (1981) (hereinafter Denicola).\nCensus data therefore do not trigger copyright because\nthese data are not \"original\" in the constitutional sense.\nNimmer § 2.03[E]. The same is true of all facts -- scien\ntific, historical, biographical, and news of the day. \"They\nmay not be copyrighted and are part of the public domain\navailable to every person.\" Miller, supra, at 1369.\nFactual compilations, on the other hand, may possess\n\nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)\nPage 4\nthe requisite originality. The compilation author typically\nchooses which facts to include, in what order to place\nthem, and how to arrange the collected data so that they\nmay be used effectively by readers. These choices as to\nselection and arrangement, so long as they are made inde\npendently by the compiler and entail a minimal degree of\ncreativity, are sufficiently original that Congress may pro\ntect such compilations through the copyright laws. Nim\nmer § § 2.11[D], 3.03; Denicola 523, n. 38. Thus, even a\ndirectory that contains absolutely no protectible written\nexpression, only facts, meets the constitutional minimum\nfor copyright protection if it features an original selection\nor arrangement. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 547.\nAccord, Nimmer § 3.03.\nThis protection is subject to an important limitation.\nThe mere fact that a work is copyrighted does not mean\nthat every element of the work may be protected. Origi\nnality remains the sine qua non of copyright; accordingly,\ncopyright protection may extend only to those compo\nnents of a work that are original to the author. Patterson\n& Joyce 800-802; Ginsburg, Creation and Commercial\nValue: Copyright Protection of Works of Information,\n90 Colum. L. Rev. 1865, 1868, and n. 12 (1990) (here\ninafter Ginsburg). Thus, if the compilation author clothes\nfacts with an original collocation of words, he or she may\nbe able to claim a copyright in this written expression.\nOthers may copy the underlying facts from the publica\ntion, but not the precise words used to present them.\nIn Harper & Row, for example, we explained that Pres\nident Ford could not prevent others from copying bare\nhistorical facts from his autobiography, see 471 U.S., at\n556-557, but that he could prevent others from copying\nhis \"subjective descriptions and portraits of public fig\nures.\" Id., at 563. Where the compilation author adds\nno written expression but rather lets the facts speak for\nthemselves, the expressive element is more elusive. The\nonly conceivable expression is the manner in which the\ncompiler has selected and arranged the facts. Thus, if the\nselection and arrangement are original, these elements of\nthe work are eligible for copyright protection. See Patry,\nCopyright in Compilations of Facts (or Why the \"White\nPages\" Are Not Copyrightable), 12 Com. & Law 37, 64\n(Dec. 1990) (hereinafter Patry). No matter how original\nthe format, however, the facts themselves do not become\noriginal through association. See Patterson & Joyce 776.\nThis inevitably means that the copyright in a factual\ncompilation is thin. Notwithstanding a valid copyright,\na subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts con\ntained in another's publication to aid in preparing a com\npeting work, so long as the competing work does not fea\nture the same selection and arrangement. As one com\nmentator explains it: \"No matter how much original au\nthorship the work displays, the facts and ideas it exposes\nare free for the taking. . . . The very same facts and ideas\nmay be divorced from the context imposed by the author,\nand restated or reshuffled by second comers, even if the\nauthor was the first to discover the facts or to propose\nthe ideas.\" Ginsburg 1868.\nIt may seem unfair that much of the fruit of the com\npiler's labor may be used by others without compensa\ntion. As Justice Brennan has correctly observed, how\never, this is not \"some unforeseen byproduct of a statu\ntory scheme.\" Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 589 (dissent\ning opinion). It is, rather, \"the essence of copyright,\"\nibid., and a constitutional requirement.\nThe primary\nobjective of copyright is not to reward the labor of au\nthors, but \"to promote the Progress of Science and useful\nArts.\" Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Accord, Twentieth Century Mu\nsic Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156 (1975). To this\nend, copyright assures authors the right to their original\nexpression, but encourages others to build freely upon\nthe ideas and information conveyed by a work. Harper\n& Row, supra, at 556-557. This principle, known as the\nidea/expression or fact/expression dichotomy, applies to\nall works of authorship. As applied to a factual compila\ntion, assuming the absence of original written expression,\nonly the compiler's selection and arrangement may be\nprotected; the raw facts may be copied at will. This re\nsult is neither unfair nor unfortunate. It is the means by\nwhich copyright advances the progress of science and art.\nThis\nCourt\nhas\nlong\nrecognized\nthat\nthe\nfact/expression dichotomy limits severely the scope of\nprotection in fact-based works. More than a century ago,\nthe Court observed: \"The very object of publishing a\nbook on science or the useful arts is to communicate to\nthe world the useful knowledge which it contains. But\nthis object would be frustrated if the knowledge could\nnot be used without incurring the guilt of piracy of the\nbook.\" Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 103 (1880). We\nreiterated this point in Harper & Row:\n\"No author may copyright facts or ideas. The copy\nright is limited to those aspects of the work -- termed\n'expression' -- that display the stamp of the author's\noriginality.\n\"Copyright does not prevent subsequent users from\ncopying from a prior author's work those constituent el\nements that are not original -- for example . . . facts, or\nmaterials in the public domain -- as long as such use\ndoes not unfairly appropriate the author's original con\ntributions.\" 471 U.S., at 547-548 (citation omitted).\nThis, then, resolves the doctrinal tension: Copyright\ntreats facts and factual compilations in a wholly consis\ntent manner. Facts, whether alone or as part of a com\npilation, are not original and therefore may not be copy\nrighted. A factual compilation is eligible for copyright if\nit features an original selection or arrangement of facts,\nbut the copyright is limited to the particular selection or\narrangement. In no event may copyright extend to the\nfacts themselves.\nII -- B\nAs we have explained, originality is a constitution\nally mandated prerequisite for copyright protection. The\nCourt's decisions announcing this rule predate the Copy\nright Act of 1909, but ambiguous language in the 1909\n\nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)\nPage 5\nAct caused some lower courts temporarily to lose sight of\nthis requirement.\nThe 1909 Act embodied the originality requirement,\nbut not as clearly as it might have. See Nimmer § 2.01.\nThe subject matter of copyright was set out in § § 3 and 4\nof the Act. Section 4 stated that copyright was available\nto all the writings of an author.\" 35 Stat. 1076. By us\ning the words \"writings\" and \"author\" -- the same words\nused in Article I, § 8, of the Constitution and defined by\nthe Court in The Trade-Mark Cases and Burrow-Giles\n-- the statute necessarily incorporated the originality re\nquirement articulated in the Court's decisions. It did so\nimplicitly, however, thereby leaving room for error.\nSection 3 was similarly ambiguous. It stated that the\ncopyright in a work protected only \"the copyrightable\ncomponent parts of the work.\" It thus stated an im\nportant copyright principle, but failed to identify the spe\ncific characteristic -- originality -- that determined which\ncomponent parts of a work were copyrightable and which\nwere not.\nMost courts construed the 1909 Act correctly,\nnotwithstanding the less-than-perfect statutory language.\nThey understood from this Court's decisions that there\ncould be no copyright without originality. See Patterson\n& Joyce 760-761. As explained in the Nimmer treatise:\n\"The 1909 Act neither defined originality, nor even ex\npressly required that a work be 'original' in order to com\nmand protection. However, the courts uniformly inferred\nthe requirement from the fact that copyright protection\nmay only be claimed by 'authors'. . . . It was reasoned\nthat since an author is 'the . . . creator, originator' it fol\nlows that a work is not the product of an author unless\nthe work is original.\" Nimmer § 2.01 (footnotes omitted)\n(citing cases).\nBut some courts misunderstood the statute. See, e.g.,\nLeon v. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co., 91 F. 2d 484\n(CA9 1937); Jeweler's Circular Publishing Co. v. Key\nstone Publishing Co., 281 F. 83 (CA2 1922).\nThese\ncourts ignored §§ 3 and 4, focusing their attention in\nstead on § 5 of the Act. Section 5, however, was purely\ntechnical in nature: It provided that a person seeking to\nregister a work should indicate on the application the type\nof work, and it listed 14 categories under which the work\nmight fall. One of these categories was \"books, including\ncomposite and cyclopaedic works, directories, gazetteers,\nand other compilations.\" § 5(a). Section 5 did not pur\nport to say that all compilations were automatically copy\nrightable. Indeed, it expressly disclaimed any such func\ntion, pointing out that \"the subject-matter of copyright\nis defined in section four.\" Nevertheless, the fact that\nfactual compilations were mentioned specifically in § 5\nled some courts to infer erroneously that directories and\nthe like were copyrightable per se, \"without any further\nor precise showing of original -- personal -- authorship.\"\nGinsburg 1895.\nMaking matters worse, these courts developed a new\ntheory to justify the protection of factual compilations.\nKnown alternatively as \"sweat of the brow\" or \"industri\nous collection,\" the underlying notion was that copyright\nwas a reward for the hard work that went into compiling\nfacts. The classic formulation of the doctrine appeared in\nJeweler's Circular Publishing Co., 281 F., at 88:\n\"The right to copyright a book upon which one has\nexpended labor in its preparation does not depend upon\nwhether the materials which he has collected consist\nor not of matters which are publici juris, or whether\nsuch materials show literary skill or originality, either in\nthought or in language, or anything more than industri\nous collection. The man who goes through the streets of a\ntown and puts down the names of each of the inhabitants,\nwith their occupations and their street number, acquires\nmaterial of which he is the author\" (emphasis added).\nThe \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine had numerous flaws,\nthe most glaring being that it extended copyright pro\ntection in a compilation beyond selection and arrange\nment -- the compiler's original contributions -- to the\nfacts themselves. Under the doctrine, the only defense\nto infringement was independent creation. A subsequent\ncompiler was \"not entitled to take one word of informa\ntion previously published,\" but rather had to \"indepen\ndently work out the matter for himself, so as to arrive\nat the same result from the same common sources of in\nformation.\" Id., at 88-89 (internal quotations omitted).\n\"Sweat of the brow\" courts thereby eschewed the most\nfundamental axiom of copyright law -- that no one may\ncopyright facts or ideas. See Miller v. Universal City Stu\ndios, Inc., 650 F. 2d, at 1372 (criticizing \"sweat of the\nbrow\" courts because \"ensuring that later writers obtain\nthe facts independently . . . is precisely the scope of pro\ntection given . . . copyrighted matter, and the law is clear\nthat facts are not entitled to such protection\").\nDecisions of this Court applying the 1909 Act make\nclear that the statute did not permit the \"sweat of the\nbrow\" approach. The best example is International News\nService v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215 (1918). In that\ndecision, the Court stated unambiguously that the 1909\nAct conferred copyright protection only on those elements\nof a work that were original to the author. International\nNews Service had conceded taking news reported by As\nsociated Press and publishing it in its own newspapers.\nRecognizing that § 5 of the Act specifically mentioned\n'\"periodicals, including newspapers,'\" § 5(b), the Court\nacknowledged that news articles were copyrightable. Id.,\nat 234. It flatly rejected, however, the notion that the\ncopyright in an article extended to the factual informa\ntion it contained: \"The news element -- the information\nrespecting current events contained in the literary pro\nduction -- is not the creation of the writer, but is a re\nport of matters that ordinarily are publici juris; it is the\nhistory of the day.\" Ibid.1\n1The Court ultimately rendered judgment for Associated Press on non-copyright grounds that are not relevant here. See 248 U.S., at\n235, 241-242.\n\nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)\nPage 6\nWithout a doubt, the \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine\nflouted basic copyright principles. Throughout history,\ncopyright law has \"recognized a greater need to dissem\ninate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.\"\nHarper & Row, 471 U.S., at 563. Accord, Gorman, Fact\nor Fancy: The Implications for Copyright, 29 J. Copy\nright Soc. 560, 563 (1982). But \"sweat of the brow\"\ncourts took a contrary view; they handed out proprietary\ninterests in facts and declared that authors are absolutely\nprecluded from saving time and effort by relying upon the\nfacts contained in prior works. In truth, \"it is just such\nwasted effort that the proscription against the copyright\nof ideas and facts . . . [is] designed to prevent.\" Rosemont\nEnterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F. 2d 303,\n310 (CA2 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1009 (1967).\n\"Protection for the fruits of such research . . . may in cer\ntain circumstances be available under a theory of unfair\ncompetition. But to accord copyright protection on this\nbasis alone distorts basic copyright principles in that it\ncreates a monopoly in public domain materials without\nthe necessary justification of protecting and encouraging\nthe creation of 'writings' by 'authors.'\" Nimmer § 3.04,\np. 3-23 (footnote omitted).\nII -- C\n\"Sweat of the brow\" decisions did not escape the at\ntention of the Copyright Office. When Congress decided\nto overhaul the copyright statute and asked the Copy\nright Office to study existing problems, see Mills Music,\nInc. v. Snyder, 469 U.S. 153, 159 (1985), the Copyright\nOffice promptly recommended that Congress clear up the\nconfusion in the lower courts as to the basic standards of\ncopyrightability. The Register of Copyrights explained in\nhis first report to Congress that \"originality\" was a \"ba\nsic requisite\" of copyright under the 1909 Act, but that\n\"the absence of any reference to [originality] in the statute\nseems to have led to misconceptions as to what is copy\nrightable matter.\" Report of the Register of Copyrights\non the General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law, 87th\nCong., 1st Sess., p. 9 (H. Judiciary Comm. Print 1961).\nThe Register suggested making the originality require\nment explicit. Ibid.\nCongress took the Register's advice.\nIn enacting\nthe Copyright Act of 1976, Congress dropped the ref\nerence to \"all the writings of an author\" and replaced\nit with the phrase \"original works of authorship.\" 17\nU.S.C. § 102(a). In making explicit the originality re\nquirement, Congress announced that it was merely clar\nifying existing law: \"The two fundamental criteria of\ncopyright protection [are] originality and fixation in tan\ngible form. . . . The phrase 'original works of authorship,'\nwhich is purposely left undefined, is intended to incorpo\nrate without change the standard of originality established\nby the courts under the present [1909] copyright statute.\"\nH. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 51 (1976) (emphasis added)\n(hereinafter H. R. Rep.); S. Rep. No. 94-473, p. 50 (1975)\n(emphasis added) (hereinafter S. Rep.). This sentiment\nwas echoed by the Copyright Office: \"Our intention here\nis to maintain the established standards of originality. . . . \"\nSupplementary Report of the Register of Copyrights on\nthe General Revision of U.S. Copyright Law, 89th Cong.,\n1st Sess., pt. 6, p. 3 (H. Judiciary Comm. Print 1965)\n(emphasis added).\nTo ensure that the mistakes of the \"sweat of the brow\"\ncourts would not be repeated, Congress took additional\nmeasures. For example, § 3 of the 1909 Act had stated\nthat copyright protected only the \"copyrightable compo\nnent parts\" of a work, but had not identified originality\nas the basis for distinguishing those component parts that\nwere copyrightable from those that were not. The 1976\nAct deleted this section and replaced it with § 102(b),\nwhich identifies specifically those elements of a work for\nwhich copyright is not available: \"In no case does copy\nright protection for an original work of authorship extend\nto any idea, procedure, process, system, method of oper\nation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the\nform in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or\nembodied in such work.\" Section 102(b) is universally\nunderstood to prohibit any copyright in facts. Harper\n& Row, supra, at 547, 556. Accord, Nimmer § 2.03[E]\n(equating facts with \"discoveries\"). As with § 102(a),\nCongress emphasized that § 102(b) did not change the\nlaw, but merely clarified it: \"Section 102(b) in no way\nenlarges or contracts the scope of copyright protection\nunder the present law. Its purpose is to restate . . . that\nthe basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains\nunchanged.\" H. R. Rep., at 57; S. Rep., at 54.\nCongress took another step to minimize confusion by\ndeleting the specific mention of \"directories . . . and other\ncompilations\" in § 5 of the 1909 Act. As mentioned, this\nsection had led some courts to conclude that directories\nwere copyrightable per se and that every element of a di\nrectory was protected. In its place, Congress enacted two\nnew provisions. First, to make clear that compilations\nwere not copyrightable per se, Congress provided a defi\nnition of the term \"compilation.\" Second, to make clear\nthat the copyright in a compilation did not extend to the\nfacts themselves, Congress enacted § 103.\nThe definition of \"compilation\" is found in § 101 of\nthe 1976 Act. It defines a \"compilation\" in the copyright\nsense as \"a work formed by the collection and assembling\nof preexisting materials or of data that are selected, co\nordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting\nwork as a whole constitutes an original work of author\nship\" (emphasis added).\nThe purpose of the statutory definition is to empha\nsize that collections of facts are not copyrightable per se.\nIt conveys this message through its tripartite structure,\nas emphasized above by the italics. The statute identifies\nthree distinct elements and requires each to be met for a\nwork to qualify as a copyrightable compilation: (1) the\ncollection and assembly of pre-existing material, facts, or\n\nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)\nPage 7\ndata; (2) the selection, coordination, or arrangement of\nthose materials; and (3) the creation, by virtue of the\nparticular selection, coordination, or arrangement, of an\n\"original\" work of authorship. \"This tripartite conjunc\ntive structure is self-evident, and should be assumed to\n'accurately express the legislative purpose.'\" Patry 51,\nquoting Mills Music, 469 U.S., at 164.\nAt first glance, the first requirement does not seem\nto tell us much. It merely describes what one normally\nthinks of as a compilation -- a collection of pre-existing\nmaterial, facts, or data. What makes it significant is that\nit is not the sole requirement. It is not enough for copy\nright purposes that an author collects and assembles facts.\nTo satisfy the statutory definition, the work must get over\ntwo additional hurdles. In this way, the plain language\nindicates that not every collection of facts receives copy\nright protection. Otherwise, there would be a period after\n\"data.\"\nThe third requirement is also illuminating. It empha\nsizes that a compilation, like any other work, is copy\nrightable only if it satisfies the originality requirement\n(\"an original work of authorship\"). Although § 102 states\nplainly that the originality requirement applies to all\nworks, the point was emphasized with regard to compi\nlations to ensure that courts would not repeat the mis\ntake of the \"sweat of the brow\" courts by concluding that\nfact-based works are treated differently and measured by\nsome other standard. As Congress explained it, the goal\nwas to \"make plain that the criteria of copyrightable sub\nject matter stated in section 102 apply with full force to\nworks . . . containing preexisting material.\" H. R. Rep., at\n57; S. Rep., at 55.\nThe key to the statutory definition is the second\nrequirement.\nIt instructs courts that, in determining\nwhether a fact-based work is an original work of au\nthorship, they should focus on the manner in which the\ncollected facts have been selected, coordinated, and ar\nranged. This is a straight-forward application of the orig\ninality requirement. Facts are never original, so the com\npilation author can claim originality, if at all, only in the\nway the facts are presented. To that end, the statute dic\ntates that the principal focus should be on whether the\nselection, coordination, and arrangement are sufficiently\noriginal to merit protection.\nNot every selection, coordination, or arrangement will\npass muster. This is plain from the statute. It states that,\nto merit protection, the facts must be selected, coordi\nnated, or arranged \"in such a way\" as to render the work\nas a whole original. This implies that some \"ways\" will\ntrigger copyright, but that others will not. See Patry 57,\nand n. 76. Otherwise, the phrase \"in such a way\" is mean\ningless and Congress should have defined \"compilation\"\nsimply as \"a work formed by the collection and assembly\nof preexisting materials or data that are selected, coor\ndinated, or arranged.\" That Congress did not do so is\ndispositive. In accordance with \"the established princi\nple that a court should give effect, if possible, to every\nclause and word of a statute,\" Moskal v. United States,\n498 U.S. 103, 109-110 (1990) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), we conclude that the statute envisions that\nthere will be some fact-based works in which the selec\ntion, coordination, and arrangement are not sufficiently\noriginal to trigger copyright protection.\nAs discussed earlier, however, the originality require\nment is not particularly stringent. A compiler may settle\nupon a selection or arrangement that others have used;\nnovelty is not required. Originality requires only that the\nauthor make the selection or arrangement independently\n(i.e., without copying that selection or arrangement from\nanother work), and that it display some minimal level\nof creativity. Presumably, the vast majority of compila\ntions will pass this test, but not all will. There remains\na narrow category of works in which the creative spark\nis utterly lacking or so trivial as to be virtually nonexis\ntent. See generally Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing\nCo., 188 U.S. 239, 251 (1903) (referring to \"the narrow\nest and most obvious limits\"). Such works are incapable\nof sustaining a valid copyright. Nimmer § 2.01[B].\nEven if a work qualifies as a copyrightable compila\ntion, it receives only limited protection. This is the point\nof § 103 of the Act. Section 103 explains that \"the subject\nmatter of copyright . . . includes compilations,\" § 103(a),\nbut that copyright protects only the author's original con\ntributions -- not the facts or information conveyed:\n\"The copyright in a compilation . . . extends only to\nthe material contributed by the author of such work, as\ndistinguished from the preexisting material employed in\nthe work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the\npreexisting material.\" § 103(b).\nAs § 103 makes clear, copyright is not a tool by which a\ncompilation author may keep others from using the facts\nor data he or she has collected. \"The most important\npoint here is one that is commonly misunderstood today:\ncopyright . . . has no effect one way or the other on the\ncopyright or public domain status of the preexisting ma\nterial.\" H. R. Rep., at 57; S. Rep., at 55. The 1909 Act\ndid not require, as \"sweat of the brow\" courts mistakenly\nassumed, that each subsequent compiler must start from\nscratch and is precluded from relying on research under\ntaken by another. See, e.g., Jeweler's Circular Publish\ning Co., 281 F., at 88-89. Rather, the facts contained\nin existing works may be freely copied because copyright\nprotects only the elements that owe their origin to the\ncompiler -- the selection, coordination, and arrangement\nof facts.\nIn summary, the 1976 revisions to the Copyright Act\nleave no doubt that originality, not \"sweat of the brow,\"\nis the touchstone of copyright protection in directories\nand other fact-based works. Nor is there any doubt that\nthe same was true under the 1909 Act. The 1976 revi\nsions were a direct response to the Copyright Office's con\ncern that many lower courts had misconstrued this basic\nprinciple, and Congress emphasized repeatedly that the\npurpose of the revisions was to clarify, not change, ex\n\nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)\nPage 8\nisting law. The revisions explain with painstaking clarity\nthat copyright requires originality, § 102(a); that facts are\nnever original, § 102(b); that the copyright in a compi\nlation does not extend to the facts it contains, § 103(b);\nand that a compilation is copyrightable only to the ex\ntent that it features an original selection, coordination,\nor arrangement, § 101.\nThe 1976 revisions have proven largely successful in\nsteering courts in the right direction. A good example is\nMiller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 650 F. 2d, at 1369\n1370: \"A copyright in a directory . . . is properly viewed as\nresting on the originality of the selection and arrangement\nof the factual material, rather than on the industriousness\nof the efforts to develop the information. Copyright pro\ntection does not extend to the facts themselves, and the\nmere use of information contained in a directory without\na substantial copying of the format does not constitute\ninfringement\" (citation omitted). Additionally, the Sec\nond Circuit, which almost 70 years ago issued the classic\nformulation of the \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine in Jew\neler's Circular Publishing Co., has now fully repudiated\nthe reasoning of that decision. See, e.g., Financial In\nformation, Inc. v. Moody's Investors Service, Inc., 808\nF. 2d 204, 207 (CA2 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 820\n(1987); Financial Information, Inc. v. Moody's Investors\nService, Inc., 751 F. 2d 501, 510 (CA2 1984) (Newman,\nJ., concurring); Hoehling v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,\n618 F. 2d 972, 979 (CA2 1980). Even those scholars who\nbelieve that \"industrious collection\" should be rewarded\nseem to recognize that this is beyond the scope of exist\ning copyright law. See Denicola 516 (\"The very vocabu\nlary of copyright is ill suited to analyzing property rights\nin works of nonfiction\"); id., at 520-521, 525; Ginsburg\n1867, 1870.\nIII\nThere is no doubt that Feist took from the white\npages of Rural's directory a substantial amount of fac\ntual information. At a minimum, Feist copied the names,\ntowns, and telephone numbers of 1,309 of Rural's sub\nscribers. Not all copying, however, is copyright infringe\nment. To establish infringement, two elements must be\nproven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copy\ning of constituent elements of the work that are original.\nSee Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 548. The first element\nis not at issue here; Feist appears to concede that Ru\nral's directory, considered as a whole, is subject to a valid\ncopyright because it contains some foreword text, as well\nas original material in its yellow pages advertisements.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 18; Pet. for Cert. 9.\nThe question is whether Rural has proved the second\nelement. In other words, did Feist, by taking 1,309 names,\ntowns, and telephone numbers from Rural's white pages,\ncopy anything that was \"original\" to Rural? Certainly,\nthe raw data does not satisfy the originality requirement.\nRural may have been the first to discover and report the\nnames, towns, and telephone numbers of its subscribers,\nbut this data does not \"owe its origin'\" to Rural. Burrow-\nGiles, 111 U.S., at 58. Rather, these bits of information\nare uncopyrightable facts; they existed before Rural re\nported them and would have continued to exist if Rural\nhad never published a telephone directory. The origi\nnality requirement \"rules out protecting . . . names, ad\ndresses, and telephone numbers of which the plaintiff by\nno stretch of the imagination could be called the author.\"\nPatterson & Joyce 776.\nRural essentially concedes the point by referring to\nthe names, towns, and telephone numbers as \"preexist\ning material.\" Brief for Respondent 17. Section 103(b)\nstates explicitly that the copyright in a compilation does\nnot extend to \"the preexisting material employed in the\nwork.\"\nThe question that remains is whether Rural selected,\ncoordinated, or arranged these uncopyrightable facts in\nan original way. As mentioned, originality is not a strin\ngent standard; it does not require that facts be presented\nin an innovative or surprising way. It is equally true,\nhowever, that the selection and arrangement of facts can\nnot be so mechanical or routine as to require no creativity\nwhatsoever. The standard of originality is low, but it does\nexist. See Patterson & Joyce 760, n. 144 (\"While this re\nquirement is sometimes characterized as modest, or a low\nthreshold, it is not without effect\") (internal quotation\nmarks omitted; citations omitted). As this Court has ex\nplained, the Constitution mandates some minimal degree\nof creativity, see The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S., at 94;\nand an author who claims infringement must prove \"the\nexistence of . . . intellectual production, of thought, and\nconception.\" Burrow-Giles, supra, at 59-60.\nThe selection, coordination, and arrangement of Ru\nral's white pages do not satisfy the minimum constitu\ntional standards for copyright protection. As mentioned\nat the outset, Rural's white pages are entirely typical.\nPersons desiring telephone service in Rural's service area\nfill out an application and Rural issues them a telephone\nnumber. In preparing its white pages, Rural simply takes\nthe data provided by its subscribers and lists it alphabet\nically by surname. The end product is a garden-variety\nwhite pages directory, devoid of even the slightest trace\nof creativity.\nRural's selection of listings could not be more obvious:\nIt publishes the most basic information -- name, town,\nand telephone number -- about each person who applies\nto it for telephone service. This is \"selection\" of a sort,\nbut it lacks the modicum of creativity necessary to trans\nform mere selection into copyrightable expression. Rural\nexpended sufficient effort to make the white pages direc\ntory useful, but insufficient creativity to make it original.\nWe note in passing that the selection featured in Ru\nral's white pages may also fail the originality requirement\nfor another reason. Feist points out that Rural did not\ntruly \"select\" to publish the names and telephone num\nbers of its subscribers; rather, it was required to do so\nby the Kansas Corporation Commission as part of its\nmonopoly franchise. See 737 F. Supp., at 612. Accord\n\nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991)\nPage 9\ningly, one could plausibly conclude that this selection was\ndictated by state law, not by Rural.\nNor can Rural claim originality in its coordination and\narrangement of facts. The white pages do nothing more\nthan list Rural's subscribers in alphabetical order. This\narrangement may, technically speaking, owe its origin to\nRural; no one disputes that Rural undertook the task of\nalphabetizing the names itself. But there is nothing re\nmotely creative about arranging names alphabetically in\na white pages directory. It is an age-old practice, firmly\nrooted in tradition and so commonplace that it has come\nto be expected as a matter of course. See Brief for In\nformation Industry Association et al. as Amici Curiae\n10 (alphabetical arrangement \"is universally observed in\ndirectories published by local exchange telephone com\npanies\"). It is not only unoriginal, it is practically in\nevitable. This time-honored tradition does not possess\nthe minimal creative spark required by the Copyright Act\nand the Constitution.\nWe conclude that the names, towns, and telephone\nnumbers copied by Feist were not original to Rural and\ntherefore were not protected by the copyright in Rural's\ncombined white and yellow pages directory. As a consti\ntutional matter, copyright protects only those constituent\nelements of a work that possess more than a de minimis\nquantum of creativity. Rural's white pages, limited to\nbasic subscriber information and arranged alphabetically,\nfall short of the mark. As a statutory matter, 17 U.S.C. §\n101 does not afford protection from copying to a collec\ntion of facts that are selected, coordinated, and arranged\nin a way that utterly lacks originality. Given that some\nworks must fail, we cannot imagine a more likely candi\ndate. Indeed, were we to hold that Rural's white pages\npass muster, it is hard to believe that any collection of\nfacts could fail.\nBecause Rural's white pages lack the requisite orig\ninality, Feist's use of the listings cannot constitute in\nfringement. This decision should not be construed as\ndemeaning Rural's efforts in compiling its directory, but\nrather as making clear that copyright rewards originality,\nnot effort. As this Court noted more than a century ago,\n\"great praise may be due to the plaintiffs for their indus\ntry and enterprise in publishing this paper, yet the law\ndoes not contemplate their being rewarded in this way.\"\nBaker v. Selden, 101 U.S., at 105.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nReversed.\nJustice Blackmun concurs in the judgment."

It contains a large library of news materials, Lexis's commercial annotated edition of the United States\nCode and the Constitution, similar state materials, Congressional bills and federal statutes starting from 1989, the\nCongressional Record, the Federal Register, the Code of Federal Regulations, and virtually every published decision\nof a federal or state court that you could find in a law library.\nTo begin, go to http://web.lexisnexis.com/universe and click \"Legal Research.\"\n- To get a decision by name: \"Get a Case,\" then enter the names of the parties.\n- To get a decision by citation: \"Get a Case,\" then enter the citation.\n- To get a section of the United States Code: \"Federal Code,\" then \"Guided Search,\" and search by \"Cite\" as\nfollows: to get 47 U.S.C. § 230, enter \"47 USCS sec 230\".\n- To get a public law: \"Congressional,\" then \"Laws,\" then \"Laws by Number.\"\n- To get a Congressional bill: \"Congressional,\" then \"Bills,\" then \"Bills by Number.\"\nMost of the search forms also let you search by contents as well as citation, and there are lots of materials available\nin addition to the above. Don't be afraid to explore!\n4. Structure of the federal court system\nCivil and criminal cases start at a federal district court in front of a single trial judge appointed for life\nby the president. All of Massachusetts is in one district, the District of Massachusetts (D. Mass). There are\ncourthouses in Boston, Worcester, and Springfield that house the United States District Court for the District\nof Massachusetts.\nThe losing party can usually appeal a \"final judgment or order\" to a threejudge panel of a federal appeals\ncourt. The federal court system is organized geographically into 12 \"circuits,\" each with a court of appeals. Cases\nfrom our district court are appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. There are\nalso some specialized appeals courts, like the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears all patentrelated appeals.\nThere are six \"active\" judges on the First Circuit Court of Appeals (the smallest in the country), but only three\nrandomlyselected judges on a panel. If a majority of active judges on the court vote to allow it, a case can be reheard\nby a federal appeals court sitting en banc, usually the entire court. This happens rarely.\nFinally, a losing party in a federal appeals court or a state supreme court can file a \"petition for certiorari\" with\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in Washington, D.C. Unlike a direct appeal, the Supreme Court is not\nrequired to hear your case and in fact only grants \"cert\" for about one percent of requests.\nFederal courts have jurisdiction to hear cases involving federal laws, like copyright (Recording Indus. Ass'n of\nAm., supra) and deprivation of civil rights (Reno v. ACLU, supra). They also have jurisdiction to hear some cases\narising under state laws, when the value of the dispute is more than $75,000 and the parties are in different states:\na \"diversity\" case (Zeran, supra). States' own court systems hear the rest of the cases. Most states have systems\nsimilar in structure to the federal government."

Cal. 1991)\nPage 1\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of California\nOn Command Video Corporation v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Paramount Pictures Corporation, Twentieth\nCentury Fox Film Corporation, Universal City Studios, Inc., the Walt Disney Company, and Warner Brothers, Inc.;\nEmbassy Pictures\nNo. C-89-4022 SAW (JSB). Decided November 14, 1991 -- Filed November 14, 1991.\nFor the Plaintiff: Jeffrey King; Jeffrey Poston, Bickel &\nBrewer, Washington, D.C., Michael Healy, Sedgwick, Detert,\nMoran & Arnold, San Francisco, California.\nFor the Defendants: Robert Kuenzel, Proskauer, Rose,\nGoetz & Mendelsohn, San Francisco, California, emphCarole\nHander; Arthur Silber, Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn,\nLos Angeles, California.\nStanley A. Weigel, United States District Judge.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nPlaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that its hotel\nvideo-movie viewing system does not infringe defendants'\ncopyrights in the movies shown through the system. All\nbut one of the defendants have joined to counterclaim\nfor damages for copyright infringement by plaintiff's sys\ntem.1Before the Court are cross-motions for summary\njudgment on the issue of liability. Plaintiff, the designer\nand builder of an innovative video viewing system cur\nrently installed in a number of hotels, insists that a hotel\noccupant's viewing of one or more of defendants' movies\nthrough its system does not constitute a \"public perfor\nmance\" under the 1976 Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et\nseq. Defendants, seven major United States movie com\npanies, contend that such viewings do constitute public\nperformances and that plaintiff's system therefore vio\nlates defendants' exclusive right of public performance\nunder § 106(4) of the Act.\nI. Facts\nThe material facts of this case are not in dispute. On\nCommand has developed a system for the electronic de\nlivery of movie video tapes. The system consists of a\ncomputer program, a sophisticated electronic switch, and\na bank of video cassette players (\"VCPs\"), all of which are\ncentrally located in a hotel equipment room. The VCPs\nare connected to the hotel's guest rooms by wiring. The\ncomputer program directs the electronic switches so that\na particular VCP will be dedicated to the guest room\nwhere a particular movie is requested. Each VCP con\ntains a video tape. When a guest requests a particular\nmovie, the computer identifies the VCP containing that\nmovie, switches the VCP to that particular room, and\nstarts the movie video.\nA hotel guest operates the system from his or her room\nby remote control. After the television is turned on, the\nscreen lists a menu of available movies. The guest selects\na movie by entering the appropriate code on the remote\ncontrol. Once a particular video is selected, that video\nselection disappears from the menu of available videos\ndisplayed on all other television sets in the hotel. The\nvideo is seen only in the room where it was selected by\nthe guest. It cannot be seen in any other guest room\nor in any other location in the hotel. The viewer cannot\npause, rewind, or fast-forward the video. When the movie\nends, it is automatically rewound and then immediately\navailable for viewing by another hotel guest.\nThe only components of the system installed in the\nguest rooms are the hand-held remote control and a mi\ncroprocessor in the television set. When a guest checks\nin to the hotel, the hotel clerk uses a front-desk termi\nnal connected to the On Command computer program to\nactivate movie transmission to the appropriate room. At\nthe guest's request, the clerk can prevent the transmis\nsion of adult movies to a room or deactivate service to\na room altogether. The apparent advantages On Com\nmand's system enjoys over existing closed-circuit hotel\nvideo systems with pre-set movie times, such as \"Spec\ntravision,\" are the larger variety of movies available for\nviewing and the guests' freedom to watch them on their\nown schedule. On Command's system also eliminates the\neffort and potential guest embarrassment of in-house ho\ntel video rental programs, in which VCPs are installed in\nindividual rooms and guests must physically rent videos\nfrom the hotel staff.\nII. Discussion\nA copyright owner has the exclusive right \"to perform\nthe copyrighted work publicly\" or to authorize any such\npublic performance. 17 U.S.C. § 106(4). What consti\ntutes a public performance is defined by the Copyright\nAct in two clauses. Under clause (1), the \"public place\"\nclause, a performance is public if it occurs at a place open\nto the public or at any place where a substantial number\nof persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its\nsocial acquaintances is gathered.\n17 U.S.C. § 101. Under clause (2), the \"transmit\"\nclause, a performance is public if someone transmits or\notherwise communicates a performance or display of the\nwork to a place specified by clause (1) or to the public,\nby means of any device or process.\nId. Under the transmit clause, a performance is public\n\"whether the members of the public capable of receiving\n1Embassy Pictures does not join as a counterclaimant. According to plaintiff, Embassy was originally named as a defendant but has\nsince changed its name, was not served with the complaint, and is not a party to this suit at this time.\n\nOn Command Video Corp. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, 777 F. Supp. 787 (N.D. Cal. 1991)\nPage 2\nthe performance or display receive it in the same place\nor in separate places and at the same time or at different\ntimes.\" Id.\nBoth plaintiff and defendants base their motions for\nsummary judgment on favorable interpretations of these\nclauses. Both also rely heavily on the Ninth Circuit's de\ncision in Columbia Pictures v. Professional Real Estate,\n866 F.2d 278 (9th Cir. 1989). This Court must there\nfore determine whether On Command's system results in\nthe public performance of defendants' movies under the\nstatutory clauses and Professional Real Estate.\nA. The Public Place Clause.\nProfessional Real Estate held that hotel guest rooms\nare not \"public places\" for the purposes of the Copyright\nAct. 866 F.2d at 280. Defendants do not challenge this\nholding. Rather, defendants argue that because On Com\nmand's system comprises components dispersed through\nout a hotel -- i.e., the command center is located in a\nhotel equipment room, the hotel operator's terminal is\nin the front lobby, the transmission wiring is installed\nthroughout the walls and ceilings -- the relevant place\nof performance is not the individual hotel rooms but the\nentire hotel, which defendants contend is a public place\nunder the language of the Act. This argument is unavail\ning. At least for the purposes of public place analysis,\na performance of a work does not occur every place a\nwire carrying the performance passes through; a perfor\nmance occurs where it is received. Accepting defendants'\nargument would eviscerate both the concepts of \"perfor\nmance\" and \"public place.\" The Act defines the perfor\nmance of a motion picture as the \"showing of its images\nin any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it\naudible.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. A movie video is thus per\nformed only when it is visible and audible. In On Com\nmand's system, this viewing and hearing occurs only in\nan individual guest room. That can be the only rele\nvant place of performance for public place analysis. Since\nhotel guest rooms are indisputably not public places for\ncopyright purposes, On Command's system results in no\npublic performances under the public place clause.\nB. The Transmit Clause.\nPublic performance of defendants' movies under this\nclause occurs if On Command \"transmits\" the movies \"to\nthe public.\" Under the Copyright Act, to \"transmit\" a\nperformance is to communicate it by any device or pro\ncess whereby images or sounds are received beyond the\nplace from which they are sent.\nId. Plaintiff's argument that On Command's system\ninvolves not \"transmissions\" but \"electronic rentals\" sim\nilar to patrons' physical borrowing of videotapes is with\nout merit. On Command transmits movie performances\ndirectly under the language of the definition. The system\n\"communicates\" the motion picture \"images and sounds\"\nby a \"device or process\" -- the equipment and wiring\nnetwork -- from a central console in a hotel to individual\nguest rooms, where the images and sounds are received\n\"beyond the place from which they are sent.\" See also\nProfessional Real Estate, 866 F.2d at 282 n.7. The fact\nthat hotel guests initiate this transmission by turning on\nthe television and choosing a video is immaterial.\nOn Command's video transmissions are also \"to the\npublic\" for the purposes of the transmit clause. Hotel\nguests watching a video movie in their room through On\nCommand's system are not watching it in a \"public place\"\nbut they are nonetheless members of \"the public.\" See\nColumbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, 568\nF.Supp. 494, 219 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 995 (W.D. Pa. 1983),\naff'd 749 F.2d 154, 159, 224 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 641 (3rd\nCir. 1984) (\"the transmission of a performance to mem\nbers of the public, even in private settings such as ho\ntel rooms . . . constitutes a public performance\") (citing\nH.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. at 64 (1976)\n(\"1976 House Report\")); ESPN Inc. v. Edinburg Commu\nnity Hotel, Inc., 735 F.Supp. 1334, 1340 (S.D. Tex. 1986)\n(\"The House Report . . . on the Copyright Act makes ex\nplicit that performances to occupants of hotel rooms fall\nwithin the definition of a public performance\"). This\nis because the relationship between the transmitter of\nthe performance, On Command, and the audience, ho\ntel guests, is a commercial, \"public\" one regardless of\nwhere the viewing takes place. The non-public nature of\nthe place of the performance has no bearing on whether\nor not those who enjoy the performance constitute \"the\npublic\" under the transmit clause.\nA performance may still be public under the transmit\nclause \"whether the members of the public . . . receive it in\nthe same place or in separate places and at the same time\nor at different times.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. A 1967 Report by\nthe House of Representatives reveals that Congress added\nthis language to the transmit clause to cover precisely the\nsort of single-viewer system developed by plaintiff:\n[This language makes doubly clear that] a per\nformance made available by transmission to\nthe public at large is \"public\" even though the\nrecipients are not gathered in a single place,\nand even if there is no direct proof that any of\nthe potential recipients was operating his re\nceiving apparatus at the time of the transmis\nsion. The same principles apply whenever the\npotential recipients of the transmission rep\nresent a limited segment of the public, such\nas the occupants of hotel rooms. . . .; they are\nalso applicable where the transmission is ca\npable of reaching different recipients at differ\nent times, as in the case of sounds or images\nstored in an information system and capable\nof being performed or displayed at the initia\ntive of individual members of the public.\nH.R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. at 29 (1967).\nThus, whether the number of hotel guests viewing an\nOn Command transmission is one or one hundred, and\nwhether these guests view the transmission simultane\nously or sequentially, the transmission is still a public\n\nOn Command Video Corp. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, 777 F. Supp. 787 (N.D. Cal. 1991)\nPage 3\nperformance since it goes to members of the public. See\nalso Redd Horne, 749 F.2d at 159 (transmissions of videos\nto private viewing booths occupied by one to four per\nsons infringing under transmit clause); Paramount Pic\ntures Corp. v. Labus, 16 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) 1142, 1147\n(W.D. Wisc. 1990) (hotel's distribution of unauthorized\ncopies of video cassettes to single guest violated copy\nright owner's exclusive right to distribute work to \"the\npublic\"). On Command therefore \"publicly performs\"\ndefendants' movies under the meaning of the transmit\nclause.\nC. Defendants' Ownership of Copyright\nPlaintiff raises defendants' ownership of copyright in\na number of the movies in question as a disputed issue of\nfact. Defendants concede that their copyright in five (5)\nof these movies is insufficiently documented in the sub\nmitted exhibits and ask leave to supplement their submis\nsions accordingly. Since defendants seek summary judg\nment only on the issue of liability, however, it is unneces\nsary to postpone the Court's ruling until the documenta\ntion regarding these five movies is complete. The failure\nof proof regarding these movies bears ultimately on the\nquestion of remedies, which will be awarded only for those\ninfringements properly proven.\nAccordingly,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n(1) Defendants' motion for summary judgment is\nGRANTED;\n(2) Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is DE\nNIED;\n(3) Further proceedings on injunctive relief and dam\nages are scheduled for hearing before this Court on Jan\nuary 16, 1992, at 2:15pm. Defendants must serve and\nfile any supplemental documentation proving copyright\nownership on or before December 16, 1992. Plaintiff's\nresponse, if any, must be served and filed on or before\nDecember 31, 1992."

Respondents own the copyrights\non some of the television programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves. Some members\nof the general public use video tape recorders sold by petitioners to record some of these\nbroadcasts, as well as a large number of other broadcasts. The question presented is whether\nthe sale of petitioners' copying equipment to the general public violates any of the rights\nconferred upon respondents by the Copyright Act.\nRespondents commenced this copyright infringement action against petitioners in the\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of California in 1976. Respondents alleged\nthat some individuals had used Betamax video tape recorders (VTR's) to record some of\nrespondents' copyrighted works which had been exhibited on commercially sponsored\ntelevision and contended that these individuals had thereby infringed respondents' copyrights.\nRespondents further maintained that petitioners were liable for the copyright infringement\nallegedly committed by Betamax consumers because of petitioners' marketing of the Betamax\nVTR's. n1 Respondents sought no relief against any Betamax consumer. Instead, they sought\n\nI\nmoney damages and an equitable accounting of profits from petitioners, as well as an\ninjunction against the manufacture and marketing of Betamax VTR's.\nn1 The respondents also asserted causes of action under state law and ß 43(a) of\nthe Trademark Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 441, 15 U. S. C. ß 1125(a). These claims are not\nbefore this Court.\nAfter a lengthy trial, the District Court denied respondents all the relief they sought and\nentered judgment for petitioners. 480 F.Supp. 429 (1979). The United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's judgment on respondents' copyright claim,\nholding petitioners liable for contributory infringement and ordering the District Court to\nfashion appropriate relief. 659 F.2d 963 (1981). We granted certiorari, 457 U.S. 1116 (1982);\nsince we had not completed our study of the case last Term, we ordered reargument, 463 U.S.\n1226 (1983). We now reverse.\nAn explanation of our rejection of respondents' unprecedented attempt to impose copyright\nliability upon the distributors of copying equipment requires a quite detailed recitation of the\nfindings of the District Court. In summary, those findings reveal that the average member of\nthe public uses a VTR principally to record a program he cannot view as it is being televised\nand then to watch it once at a later time. This practice, known as \"time-shifting,\" enlarges the\ntelevision viewing audience. For that reason, a significant amount of television programming\nmay be used in this manner without objection from the owners of the copyrights on the\nprograms. For the same reason, even the two respondents in this case, who do assert\nobjections to time-shifting in this litigation, were unable to prove that the practice has\nimpaired the commercial value of their copyrights or has created any likelihood of future harm.\nGiven these findings, there is no basis in the Copyright Act upon which respondents can hold\npetitioners liable for distributing VTR's to the general public. The Court of Appeals' holding\nthat respondents are entitled to enjoin the distribution of VTR's, to collect royalties on the sale\nof such equipment, or to obtain other relief, if affirmed, would enlarge the scope of\nrespondents' statutory monopolies to encompass control over an article of commerce that is\nnot the subject of copyright protection. Such an expansion of the copyright privilege is beyond\nthe limits of the grants authorized by Congress.\nThe two respondents in this action, Universal City Studios, Inc., and Walt Disney\nProductions, produce and hold the copyrights on a substantial number of motion pictures and\nother audiovisual works. In the current marketplace, they can exploit their rights in these\nworks in a number of ways: by authorizing theatrical exhibitions, by licensing limited showings\non cable and network television, by selling syndication rights for repeated airings on local\ntelevision stations, and by marketing programs on prerecorded videotapes or videodiscs.\nSome works are suitable for exploitation through all of these avenues, while the market for\nother works is more limited.\nPetitioner Sony manufactures millions of Betamax video tape recorders and markets these\ndevices through numerous retail establishments, some of which are also petitioners in this\naction. n2 Sony's Betamax VTR is a mechanism consisting of three basic components: (1) a\ntuner, which receives electromagnetic signals transmitted over the television band of the public\nairwaves and separates them into audio and visual signals; (2) a recorder, which records such\nsignals on a magnetic tape; and (3) an adapter, which converts the audio and visual signals on\nthe tape into a composite signal that can be received by a television set.\n\nn2 The four retailers are Carter Hawley Hales Stores, Inc., Associated Dry Goods\nCorp., Federated Department Stores, Inc., and Henry's Camera Corp. The principal\ndefendants are Sony Corporation, the manufacturer of the equipment, and its wholly\nowned subsidiary, Sony Corporation of America. The advertising agency of Doyle Dane\nBernback, Inc., also involved in marketing the Betamax, is also a petitioner. An\nindividual VTR user, William Griffiths, was named as a defendant in the District Court,\nbut respondents sought no relief against him. Griffiths is not a petitioner. For\nconvenience, we shall refer to petitioners collectively as Sony.\nSeveral capabilities of the machine are noteworthy. The separate tuner in the Betamax\nenables it to record a broadcast off one station while the television set is tuned to another\nchannel, permitting the viewer, for example, to watch two simultaneous news broadcasts by\nwatching one \"live\" and recording the other for later viewing. Tapes may be reused, and\nprograms that have been recorded may be erased either before or after viewing. A timer in\nthe Betamax can be used to activate and deactivate the equipment at predetermined times,\nenabling an intended viewer to record programs that are transmitted when he or she is not at\nhome. Thus a person may watch a program at home in the evening even though it was\nbroadcast while the viewer was at work during the afternoon. The Betamax is also equipped\nwith a pause button and a fast-forward control. The pause button, when depressed,\ndeactivates the recorder until it is released, thus enabling a viewer to omit a commercial\nadvertisement from the recording, provided, of course, that the viewer is present when the\nprogram is recorded. The fast-forward control enables the viewer of a previously recorded\nprogram to run the tape rapidly when a segment he or she does not desire to see is being\nplayed back on the television screen.\nThe respondents and Sony both conducted surveys of the way the Betamax machine was\nused by several hundred owners during a sample period in 1978. Although there were some\ndifferences in the surveys, they both showed that the primary use of the machine for most\nowners was \"time-shifting\" -- the practice of recording a program to view it once at a later\ntime, and thereafter erasing it. Time-shifting enables viewers to see programs they otherwise\nwould miss because they are not at home, are occupied with other tasks, or are viewing a\nprogram on another station at the time of a broadcast that they desire to watch. Both surveys\nalso showed, however, that a substantial number of interviewees had accumulated libraries of\ntapes. n3 Sony's survey indicated that over 80% of the interviewees watched at least as much\nregular television as they had before owning a Betamax. n4 Respondents offered no evidence\nof decreased television viewing by Betamax owners. n5\nn3 As evidence of how a VTR may be used, respondents offered the testimony of\nWilliam Griffiths. Griffiths, although named as an individual defendant, was a client of\nplaintiffs' law firm. The District Court summarized his testimony as follows:\n\"He owns approximately 100 tapes. When Griffiths bought his Betamax, he intended not\nonly to time-shift (record, play-back and then erase) but also to build a library of\ncassettes. Maintaining a library, however, proved too expensive, and he is now erasing\nsome earlier tapes and reusing them.\n\"Griffiths copied about 20 minutes of a Universal motion picture called 'Never Give An\nInch,' and two episodes from Universal television series entitled 'Baa Baa Black Sheep'\nand 'Holmes and Yo Yo.' He would have erased each of these but for the request of\nplaintiffs' counsel that it be kept. Griffiths also testified that he had copied but already\nerased Universal films called 'Alpha Caper' (erased before anyone saw it) and 'Amelia\n\nEarhart.' At the time of his deposition Griffiths did not intend to keep any Universal film\nin his library.\n\"Griffiths has also recorded documentaries, news broadcasts, sporting events and\npolitical programs such as a rerun of the Nixon/Kennedy debate.\" 480 F.Supp. 429, 436\n437 (1979).\nFour other witnesses testified to having engaged in similar activity.\nn4 The District Court summarized some of the findings in these surveys as follows:\n\"According to plaintiffs' survey, 75.4% of the VTR owners use their machines to record\nfor time-shifting purposes half or most of the time. Defendants' survey showed that\n96% of the Betamax owners had used the machine to record programs they otherwise\nwould have missed.\n\"When plaintiffs asked interviewees how many cassettes were in their library, 55.8% said\nthere were 10 or fewer. In defendants' survey, of the total programs viewed by\ninterviewees in the past month, 70.4% had been viewed only that one time and for\n57.9%, there were no plans for further viewing.\" Id., at 438.\nn5 \"81.9% of the defendants' interviewees watched the same amount or more of\nregular television as they did before owning a Betamax. 83.2% reported their frequency\nof movie going was unaffected by Betamax.\" Id., at 439.\nSony introduced considerable evidence describing television programs that could be copied\nwithout objection from any copyright holder, with special emphasis on sports, religious, and\neducational programming. For example, their survey indicated that 7.3% of all Betamax use is\nto record sports events, and representatives of professional baseball, football, basketball, and\nhockey testified that they had no objection to the recording of their televised events for home\nuse. n6\nn6 See Defendants' Exh. OT, Table 20; Tr. 2447-2450, 2480, 2486-2487, 2515\n2516, 2530-2534.\nRespondents offered opinion evidence concerning the future impact of the unrestricted sale\nof VTR's on the commercial value of their copyrights. The District Court found, however, that\nthey had failed to prove any likelihood of future harm from the use of VTR's for time-shifting.\n480 F.Supp., at 469.\nThe District Court's Decision\nThe lengthy trial of the case in the District Court concerned the private, home use of VTR's\nfor recording programs broadcast on the public airwaves without charge to the viewer. n7 No\nissue concerning the transfer of tapes to other persons, the use of home-recorded tapes for\npublic performances, or the copying of programs transmitted on pay or cable television\nsystems was raised. See id., at 432-433, 442.\n\nn7 The trial also briefly touched upon demonstrations of the Betamax by the retailer\npetitioners which were alleged to be infringements by respondents. The District Court\nheld against respondents on this claim, 480 F.Supp., at 456-457, the Court of Appeals\naffirmed this holding, 659 F.2d 963, 976 (1981), and respondents did not cross-petition\non this issue.\nThe District Court concluded that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast\nover the public airwaves was a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute copyright\ninfringement. It emphasized the fact that the material was broadcast free to the public at\nlarge, the noncommercial character of the use, and the private character of the activity\nconducted entirely within the home. Moreover, the court found that the purpose of this use\nserved the public interest in increasing access to television programming, an interest that \"is\nconsistent with the First Amendment policy of providing the fullest possible access to\ninformation through the public airwaves. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic\nNational Committee, 412 U.S. 94, 102.\" Id., at 454. n8 Even when an entire copyrighted work\nwas recorded, the District Court regarded the copying as fair use \"because there is no\naccompanying reduction in the market for 'plaintiff's original work.'\" Ibid.\nn8 The court also found that this \"access is not just a matter of convenience, as\nplaintiffs have suggested. Access has been limited not simply by inconvenience but by\nthe basic need to work. Access to the better program has also been limited by the\ncompetitive practice of counterprogramming.\" 480 F.Supp., at 454.\nAs an independent ground of decision, the District Court also concluded that Sony could not\nbe held liable as a contributory infringer even if the home use of a VTR was considered an\ninfringing use. The District Court noted that Sony had no direct involvement with any Betamax\npurchasers who recorded copyrighted works off the air. Sony's advertising was silent on the\nsubject of possible copyright infringement, but its instruction booklet contained the following\nstatement:\n\"Television programs, films, videotapes and other materials may be copyrighted. Unauthorized\nrecording of such material may be contrary to the provisions of the United States copyright\nlaws.\" Id., at 436.\nThe District Court assumed that Sony had constructive knowledge of the probability that\nthe Betamax machine would be used to record copyrighted programs, but found that Sony\nmerely sold a \"product capable of a variety of uses, some of them allegedly infringing.\" Id., at\n461. It reasoned:\n\"Selling a staple article of commerce -- e. g., a typewriter, a recorder, a camera, a\nphotocopying machine -- technically contributes to any infringing use subsequently made\nthereof, but this kind of 'contribution,' if deemed sufficient as a basis for liability, would expand\nthe theory beyond precedent and arguably beyond judicial management.\n. . . .\n\". . . Commerce would indeed be hampered if manufacturers of staple items were held\nliable as contributory infringers whenever they 'constructively' knew that some purchasers on\nsome occasions would use their product for a purpose which a court later deemed, as a matter\nof first impression, to be an infringement.\" Ibid.\nFinally, the District Court discussed the respondents' prayer for injunctive relief, noting that\nthey had asked for an injunction either preventing the future sale of Betamax machines, or\n\nrequiring that the machines be rendered incapable of recording copyrighted works off the air.\nThe court stated that it had \"found no case in which the manufacturers, distributors, retailers\nand advertisers of the instrument enabling the infringement were sued by the copyright\nholders,\" and that the request for relief in this case \"is unique.\" Id., at 465.\nIt concluded that an injunction was wholly inappropriate because any possible harm to\nrespondents was outweighed by the fact that \"the Betamax could still legally be used to record\nnoncopyrighted material or material whose owners consented to the copying. An injunction\nwould deprive the public of the ability to use the Betamax for this noninfringing off-the-air\nrecording.\" Id., at 468.\nThe Court of Appeals' Decision\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment on respondents' copyright\nclaim. It did not set aside any of the District Court's findings of fact. Rather, it concluded as a\nmatter of law that the home use of a VTR was not a fair use because it was not a \"productive\nuse.\" n9 It therefore held that it was unnecessary for plaintiffs to prove any harm to the\npotential market for the copyrighted works, but then observed that it seemed clear that the\ncumulative effect of mass reproduction made possible by VTR's would tend to diminish the\npotential market for respondents' works. 659 F.2d, at 974.\nn9 \"Without a 'productive use,' i. e. when copyrighted material is reproduced for its\nintrinsic use, the mass copying of the sort involved in this case precludes an application\nof fair use.\" 659 F.2d, at 971-972.\nOn the issue of contributory infringement, the Court of Appeals first rejected the analogy to\nstaple articles of commerce such as tape recorders or photocopying machines. It noted that\nsuch machines \"may have substantial benefit for some purposes\" and do not \"even remotely\nraise copyright problems.\" Id., at 975. VTR's, however, are sold \"for the primary purpose of\nreproducing television programming\" and \"[virtually] all\" such programming is copyrighted\nmaterial. Ibid. The Court of Appeals concluded, therefore, that VTR's were not suitable for\nany substantial noninfringing use even if some copyright owners elect not to enforce their\nrights.\nThe Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court's reliance on Sony's lack of knowledge\nthat home use constituted infringement. Assuming that the statutory provisions defining the\nremedies for infringement applied also to the nonstatutory tort of contributory infringement,\nthe court stated that a defendant's good faith would merely reduce his damages liability but\nwould not excuse the infringing conduct. It held that Sony was chargeable with knowledge of\nthe homeowner's infringing activity because the reproduction of copyrighted materials was\neither \"the most conspicuous use\" or \"the major use\" of the Betamax product. Ibid.\nOn the matter of relief, the Court of Appeals concluded that \"statutory damages may be\nappropriate\" and that the District Court should reconsider its determination that an injunction\nwould not be an appropriate remedy; and, referring to \"the analogous photocopying area,\"\nsuggested that a continuing royalty pursuant to a judicially created compulsory license may\nArticle I, ß 8, of the Constitution provides:\n\"The Congress shall have Power . . . To Promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by\nsecuring for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective\nWritings and Discoveries.\"\n\nThe monopoly privileges that Congress may authorize are neither unlimited nor primarily\ndesigned to provide a special private benefit. Rather, the limited grant is a means by which an\nimportant public purpose may be achieved. It is intended to motivate the creative activity of\nauthors and inventors by the provision of a special reward, and to allow the public access to\nthe products of their genius after the limited period of exclusive control has expired.\n\"The copyright law, like the patent statutes, makes reward to the owner a secondary\nconsideration. In Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123, 127, Chief Justice Hughes spoke as\nfollows respecting the copyright monopoly granted by Congress, 'The sole interest of the\nUnited States and the primary object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits\nderived by the public from the labors of authors.' It is said that reward to the author or artist\nserves to induce release to the public of the products of his creative genius.\" United States v.\nParamount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 158 (1948).\nAs the text of the Constitution makes plain, it is Congress that has been assigned the task\nof defining the scope of the limited monopoly that should be granted to authors or to inventors\nin order to give the public appropriate access to their work product. Because this task involves\na difficult balance between the interests of authors and inventors in the control and\nexploitation of their writings and discoveries on the one hand, and society's competing interest\nin the free flow of ideas, information, and commerce on the other hand, our patent and\ncopyright statutes have been amended repeatedly. n10\nn10 In its Report accompanying the comprehensive revision of the Copyright Act in\n1909, the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives explained this balance:\n\"The enactment of copyright legislation by Congress under the terms of the\nConstitution is not based upon any natural right that the author has in his writings, . . .\nbut upon the ground that the welfare of the public will be served and progress of science\nand useful arts will be promoted by securing to authors for limited periods the exclusive\nrights to their writings. . . .\n\"In enacting a copyright law Congress must consider . . . two questions: First, how\nmuch will the legislation stimulate the producer and so benefit the public; and, second,\nhow much will the monopoly granted be detrimental to the public? The granting of such\nexclusive rights, under the proper terms and conditions, confers a benefit upon the\npublic that outweighs the evils of the temporary monopoly.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th\nCong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).\nFrom its beginning, the law of copyright has developed in response to significant changes in\ntechnology. n11 Indeed, it was the invention of a new form of copying equipment -- the\nprinting press -- that gave rise to the original need for copyright protection. n12 Repeatedly,\nas new developments have occurred in this country, it has been the Congress that has\nfashioned the new rules that new technology made necessary. Thus, long before the\nenactment of the Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 1075, it was settled that the protection given\nto copyrights is wholly statutory. Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 661-662 (1834). The\nremedies for infringement \"are only those prescribed by Congress.\" Thompson v. Hubbard, 131\nU.S. 123, 151 (1889).\nn11 Thus, for example, the development and marketing of player pianos and\nperforated rolls of music, see White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co., 209 U.S. 1\n(1908), preceded the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1909; innovations in copying\n\ntechniques gave rise to the statutory exemption for library copying embodied in ß 108 of\nthe 1976 revision of the copyright law; the development of the technology that made it\npossible to retransmit television programs by cable or by microwave systems, see\nFortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U.S. 390 (1968), and\nTeleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U.S. 394 (1974),\nprompted the enactment of the complex provisions set forth in 17 U. S. C. ß\n111(d)(2)(B) and ß 111(d)(5) (1982 ed.) after years of detailed congressional study,\nsee Eastern Microwave, Inc. v. Doubleday Sports, Inc., 691 F.2d 125, 129 (CA2 1982).\nBy enacting the Sound Recording Amendment of 1971, 85 Stat. 391, Congress also\nprovided the solution to the \"record piracy\" problems that had been created by the\ndevelopment of the audio tape recorder. Sony argues that the legislative history of that\nAct, see especially H. R. Rep. No. 92-487, p. 7 (1971), indicates that Congress did not\nintend to prohibit the private home use of either audio or video tape recording\nequipment. In view of our disposition of the contributory infringement issue, we express\nno opinion on that question.\nn12 \"Copyright protection became necessary with the invention of the printing press\nand had its early beginnings in the British censorship laws. The fortunes of the law of\ncopyright have always been closely connected with freedom of expression, on the one\nhand, and with technological improvements in means of dissemination, on the other.\nSuccessive ages have drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in the\ncontrol and exploitation of his intellectual property, the related interest of the publisher,\nand the competing interest of society in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas.\"\nForeword to B. Kaplan, An Unhurried View of Copyright vii-viii (1967).\nThe judiciary's reluctance to expand the protections afforded by the copyright without\nexplicit legislative guidance is a recurring theme. See, e. g., Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia\nBroadcasting System, Inc., 415 U.S. 394 (1974); Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television,\nInc., 392 U.S. 390 (1968); White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co., 209 U.S. 1 (1908);\nWilliams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 203 Ct. Cl. 74, 487 F.2d 1345 (1973), aff'd by an\nequally divided Court, 420 U.S. 376 (1975). Sound policy, as well as history, supports our\nconsistent deference to Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for\ncopyrighted materials. Congress has the constitutional authority and the institutional ability to\naccommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably\nimplicated by such new technology.\nIn a case like this, in which Congress has not plainly marked our course, we must be\ncircumspect in construing the scope of rights created by a legislative enactment which never\ncontemplated such a calculus of interests. In doing so, we are guided by Justice Stewart's\nexposition of the correct approach to ambiguities in the law of copyright:\n\"The limited scope of the copyright holder's statutory monopoly, like the limited copyright\nduration required by the Constitution, reflects a balance of competing claims upon the public\ninterest: Creative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must\nultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the\nother arts. The immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an 'author's'\ncreative labor. But the ultimate aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for the\ngeneral public good. 'The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in\nconferring the monopoly,' this Court has said, 'lie in the general benefits derived by the public\nfrom the labors of authors.' Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123, 127. See Kendall v. Winsor,\n\n21 How. 322, 327-328; Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 241-242. When technological change\nhas rendered its literal terms ambiguous, the Copyright Act must be construed in light of this\nbasic purpose.\" Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156 (1975) (footnotes\nomitted).\nCopyright protection \"subsists . . . in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible\nmedium of expression.\" 17 U. S. C. ß 102(a) (1982 ed.). This protection has never accorded\nthe copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work. n13 Rather, the\nCopyright Act grants the copyright holder \"exclusive\" rights to use and to authorize the use of\nhis work in five qualified ways, including reproduction of the copyrighted work in copies. ß\n106. n14 All reproductions of the work, however, are not within the exclusive domain of the\ncopyright owner; some are in the public domain. Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted\nwor for a \"fair use\"; the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use.\nCompare ß 106 with ß 107.\nn13 See, e. g., White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co., 209 U.S., at 19; cf.\nDeep South Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.S. 518, 530-531 (1972). While the law\nhas never recognized an author's right to absolute control of his work, the natural\ntendency of legal rights to express themselves in absolute terms to the exclusion of all\nelse is particularly pronounced in the history of the constitutionally sanctioned\nmonopolies of the copyright and the patent. See, e. g., United States v. Paramount\nPictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 156-158 (1948) (copyright owners claiming right to tie\nlicense of one film to license of another under copyright law); Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal,\n286 U.S. 123 (1932) (copyright owner claiming copyright renders it immune from state\ntaxation of copyright royalties); Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S. 339, 349-351\n(1908) (copyright owner claiming that a right to fix resale price of his works within the\nscope of his copyright); International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S.\n131 (1936) (patentees claiming right to tie sale of unpatented article to lease of\npatented device).\nn14 Section 106 of the Act provides:\n\"Subject to sections 107 through 118, the owner of copyright under this title has the\nexclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:\n\"(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;\n\"(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n\"(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale\nor other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;\n\"(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes,\nand motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work\npublicly; and\n\"(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes,\nand pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion\npicture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly.\"\n\"Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner,\" that is, anyone\nwho trespasses into his exclusive domain by using or authorizing the use of the copyrighted\n\nIII\nwork in one of the five ways set forth in the statute, \"is an infringer of the copyright.\" ß\n501(a). Conversely, anyone who is authorized by the copyright owner to use the copyrighted\nwork in a way specified in the statute or who makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of\nthe copyright with respect to such use.\nThe Copyright Act provides the owner of a copyright with a potent arsenal of remedies\nagainst an infringer of his work, including an injunction to restrain the infringer from violating\nhis rights, the impoundment and destruction of all reproductions of his work made in violation\nof his rights, a recovery of his actual damages and any additional profits realized by the\ninfringer or a recovery of statutory damages, and attorney's fees. ß ß 502-505. n15\nn15 Moreover, anyone who willfully infringes the copyright to reproduce a motion\npicture for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain is subject to\nsubstantial criminal penalties, 17 U. S. C. ß 506(a) (1982 ed.), and the fruits and\ninstrumentalities of the crime are forfeited upon conviction, ß 506(b).\nThe two respondents in this case do not seek relief against the Betamax users who have\nallegedly infringed their copyrights. Moreover, this is not a class action on behalf of all\ncopyright owners who license their works for television broadcast, and respondents have no\nright to invoke whatever rights other copyright holders may have to bring infringement\nactions based on Betamax copying of their works. n16 As was made clear by their own\nevidence, the copying of the respondents' programs represents a small portion of the total use\nof VTR's. It is, however, the taping of respondents' own copyrighted programs that provides\nthem with standing to charge Sony with contributory infringement. To prevail, they have the\nburden of proving that users of the Betamax have infringed their copyrights and that Sony\nshould be held responsible for that infringement.\nn16 In this regard, we reject respondents' attempt to cast this action as comparable\nto a class action because of the positions taken by amici with copyright interests and\ntheir attempt to treat the statements made by amici as evidence in this case. See Brief\nfor Respondents 1, and n. 1, 6, 52, 53, and n. 116. The stated desires of amici\nconcerning the outcome of this or any litigation are no substitute for a class action, are\nnot evidence in the case, and do not influence our decision; we examine an amicus\ncuriae brief solely for whatever aid it provides in analyzing the legal questions before us.\nThe Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by\nanother. In contrast, the Patent Act expressly brands anyone who \"actively induces\ninfringement of a patent\" as an infringer, 35 U. S. C. ß 271(b), and further imposes liability on\ncertain individuals labeled \"contributory\" infringers, ß 271(c). The absence of such express\nlanguage in the copyright statute does not preclude the imposition of liability for copyright\ninfringements on certain parties who have not themselves engaged in the infringing activity.\nn17 For vicarious liability is imposed in virtually all areas of the law, and the concept of\ncontributory infringement is merely a species of the broader problem of identifying the\ncircumstances in which it is just to hold one individual accountable for the actions of another.\n\nn17 As the District Court correctly observed, however, \"the lines between direct\ninfringement, contributory infringement and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn . . .\n.\" 480 F.Supp., at 457-458. The lack of clarity in this area may, in part, be attributable\nto the fact that an infringer is not merely one who uses a work without authorization by\nthe copyright owner, but also one who authorizes the use of a copyrighted work without\nactual authority from the copyright owner.\nWe note the parties' statements that the questions of Sony's liability under the\n\"doctrines\" of \"direct infringement\" and \"vicarious liability\" are not nominally before this\nCourt. Compare Brief for Respondents 9, n. 22, 41, n. 90, with Reply Brief for\nPetitioners 1, n. 2. We also observe, however, that reasoned analysis of respondents'\nunprecedented contributory infringement claim necessarily entails consideration of\narguments and case law which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed\nthe parties to a large extent rely upon such arguments and authority in support of their\nrespective positions on the issue of contributory infringement.\nSuch circumstances were plainly present in Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U.S. 55\n(1911), the copyright decision of this Court on which respondents place their principal reliance.\nIn Kalem, the Court held that the producer of an unauthorized film dramatization of the\ncopyrighted book Ben Hur was liable for his sale of the motion picture to jobbers, who in turn\narranged for the commercial exhibition of the film. Justice Holmes, writing for the Court,\nexplained:\n\"The defendant not only expected but invoked by advertisement the use of its films for\ndramatic reproduction of the story. That was the most conspicuous purpose for which they\ncould be used, and the one for which especially they were made. If the defendant did not\ncontribute to the infringement it is impossible to do so except by taking part in the final act. It\nis liable on principles recognized in every part of the law.\" Id., at 62-63.\nThe use for which the item sold in Kalem had been \"especially\" made was, of course, to\ndisplay the performance that had already been recorded upon it. The producer had personally\nappropriated the copyright owner's protected work and, as the owner of the tangible medium\nof expression upon which the protected work was recorded, authorized that use by his sale of\nthe film to jobbers. But that use of the film was not his to authorize: the copyright owner\npossessed the exclusive right to authorize public performances of his work. Further, the\nproducer personally advertised the unauthorized public performances, dispelling any possible\ndoubt as to the use of the film which he had authorized.\nRespondents argue that Kalem stands for the proposition that supplying the \"means\" to\naccomplish an infringing activity and encouraging that activity through advertisement are\nsufficient to establish liability for copyright infringement. This argument rests on a gross\ngeneralization that cannot withstand scrutiny. The producer in Kalem did not merely provide\nthe \"means\" to accomplish an infringing activity; the producer supplied the work itself, albeit in\na new medium of expression. Sony in the instant case does not supply Betamax consumers\nwith respondents' works; respondents do. Sony supplies a piece of equipment that is generally\ncapable of copying the entire range of programs that may be televised: those that are\nuncopyrighted, those that are copyrighted but may be copied without objection from the\ncopyright holder, and those that the copyright holder would prefer not to have copied. The\nBetamax can be used to make authorized or unauthorized uses of copyrighted works, but the\nrange of its potential use is much broader than the particular infringing use of the film Ben Hur\ninvolved in Kalem. Kalem does not support respondents' novel theory of liability.\nJustice Holmes stated that the producer had \"contributed\" to the infringement of the\ncopyright, and the label \"contributory infringement\" has been applied in a number of lower\n\ncourt copyright cases involving an ongoing relationship between the direct infringer and the\ncontributory infringer at the time the infringing conduct occurred. In such cases, as in other\nsituations in which the imposition of vicarious liability is manifestly just, the \"contributory\"\ninfringer was in a position to control the use of copyrighted works by others and had\nauthorized the use without permission from the copyright owner. n18 This case, however,\nplainly does not fall in that category. The only contact between Sony and the users of the\nBetamax that is disclosed by this record occurred at the moment of sale. The District Court\nexpressly found that \"no employee of Sony, Sonam or DDBI had either direct involvement with\nthe allegedly infringing activity or direct contact with purchasers of Betamax who recorded\ncopyrighted works off-the-air.\" 480 F.Supp., at 460. And it further found that \"there was no\nevidence that any of the copies made by Griffiths or the other individual witnesses in this suit\nwere influenced or encouraged by [Sony's] advertisements.\" Ibid.\nn18 The so-called \"dance hall cases,\" Famous Music Corp. v. Bay State Harness\nHorse Racing & Breeding Assn., Inc., 554 F.2d 1213 (CA1 1977) (racetrack retained\ninfringer to supply music to paying customers); KECA Music, Inc. v. Dingus McGee's Co.,\n432 F.Supp. 72 (WD Mo. 1977) (cocktail lounge hired musicians to supply music to\npaying customers); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co., 36 F.2d 354\n(CA7 1929) (dance hall hired orchestra to supply music to paying customers), are often\ncontrasted with the so-called landlord-tenant cases, in which landlords who leased\npremises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and did not participate directly in any\ninfringing activity were found not to be liable for contributory infringement. E. g.,\nDeutsch v. Arnold, 98 F.2d 686 (CA2 1938).\nIn Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F.2d 304 (CA2 1963), the owner\nof 23 chainstores retained the direct infringer to run its record departments. The\nrelationship was structured as a licensing arrangement, so that the defendant bore none\nof the business risk of running the department. Instead, it received 10% or 12% of the\ndirect infringer's gross receipts. The Court of Appeals concluded:\n\"[The dance-hall cases] and this one lie closer on the spectrum to the employer-\nemployee model, than to the landlord-tenant model. . . . [On] the particular facts before\nus, . . . Green's relationship to its infringing licensee, as well as its strong concern for the\nfinancial success of the phonograph record concession, renders it liable for the\nunauthorized sales of the 'bootleg' records.\n. . . .\n\". . . [The] imposition of vicarious liability in the case before us cannot be deemed\nunduly harsh or unfair. Green has the power to police carefully the conduct of its\nconcessionaire . . .; our judgment will simply encourage it to do so, thus placing\nresponsibility where it can and should be effectively exercised.\" Id., at 308 (emphasis in\noriginal).\nIn Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc., 443 F.2d 1159\n(CA2 1971), the direct infringers retained the contributory infringer to manage their\nperformances. The contributory infringer would contact each direct infringer, obtain the\ntitles of the musical compositions to be performed, print the programs, and then sell the\nprograms to its own local organizations for distribution at the time of the direct\ninfringement. Id., at 1161. The Court of Appeals emphasized that the contributory\ninfringer had actual knowledge that the artists it was managing were performing\ncopyrighted works, was in a position to police the infringing conduct of the artists, and\nderived substantial benefit from the actions of the primary infringers. Id., at 1163.\n\nIn Screen Gems-Columbia Music, Inc. v. Mark-Fi Records, Inc., 256 F.Supp. 399\n(SDNY 1966), the direct infringer manufactured and sold bootleg records. In denying a\nmotion for summary judgment, the District Court held that the infringer's advertising\nagency, the radio stations that advertised the infringer's works, and the service agency\nthat boxed and mailed the infringing goods could all be held liable, if at trial it could be\ndemonstrated that they knew or should have known that they were dealing in illegal\ngoods.\nIf vicarious liability is to be imposed on Sony in this case, it must rest on the fact that tit\nhas sold equipment with constructive knowledge of the fact that its customers may use that\nequipment to make unauthorized copies of copyrighted material. There is no precedent in the\nlaw of copyright for the imposition of vicarious liability on such a theory. The closest analogy\nis provided by the patent law cases to which it is appropriate to refer because of the historic\nkinship between patent law and copyright law. n19\nn19 E. g., United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S., at 158; Fox Film Corp.\nv. Doyal, 286 U.S., at 131; Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 657-658 (1834). The two\nareas of the law, naturally, are not identical twins, and we exercise the caution which we\nhave expressed in the past in applying doctrine formulated in one area to the other. See\ngenerally Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 217-218 (1954); Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus,\n210 U.S., at 345.\nWe have consistently rejected the proposition that a similar kinship exists between\ncopyright law and trademark law, and in the process of doing so have recognized the\nbasic similarities between copyrights and patents. The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82,\n91-92 (1879); see also United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., 248 U.S. 90, 97\n(1918) (trademark right \"has little or no analogy\" to copyright or patent); McLean v.\nFleming, 96 U.S. 245, 254 (1878); Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 322 (1872). Given\nthe fundamental differences between copyright law and trademark law, in this copyright\ncase we do not look to the standard for contributory infringement set forth in Inwood\nLaboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 854-855 (1982), which was\ncrafted for application in trademark cases. There we observed that a manufacturer or\ndistributor could be held liable to the owner of a trademark if it intentionally induced a\nmerchant down the chain of distribution to pass off its product as that of the trademark\nowner's or if it continued to supply a product which could readily be passed off to a\nparticular merchant whom it knew was mislabeling the product with the trademark\nowner's mark. If Inwood's narrow standard for contributory trademark infringement\ngoverned here, respondents' claim of contributory infringement would merit little\ndiscussion. Sony certainly does not \"intentionally [induce]\" its customers to make\ninfringing uses of respondents' copyrights, nor does it supply its products to identified\nindividuals known by it to be engaging in continuing infringement of respondents'\ncopyrights, see id., at 855.\nIn the Patent Act both the concept of infringement and the concept of contributory\ninfringement are expressly defined by statute. n20 The prohibition against contributory\ninfringement is confined to the knowing sale of a component especially made for use in\nconnection with a particular patent. There is no suggestion in the statute that one patentee\nmay object to the sale of a product that might be used in connection with other patents.\nMoreover, the Act expressly provides that the sale of a \"staple article or commodity of\ncommerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use\" is not contributory infringement. 35 U. S.\nC. ß 271(c).\n\nn20 Title 35 U. S. C. ß 271 provides:\n\"(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses\nor sells any patented invention, within the United States during the term of the patent\ntherefor, infringes the patent.\n\"(b) Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.\n\"(c) Whoever sells a component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or\ncomposition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process,\nconstituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or\nespecially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or\ncommodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a\ncontributory infringer.\n\"(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or contributory\ninfringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal\nextension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following:\n(1) derived revenue from acts which if performed by another without his consent would\nconstitute contributory infringement of the patent; (2) licensed or authorized another to\nperform acts which if performed without his consent would constitute contributory\ninfringement of the patent; (3) sought to enforce his patent rights against infringement\nor contributory infringement.\"\nWhen a charge of contributory infringement is predicated entirely on the sale of an article\nof commerce that is used by the purchaser to infringe a patent, the public interest in access to\nthat article of commerce is necessarily implicated. A finding of contributory infringement does\nnot, of course, remove the article from the market altogether; it does, however, give the\npatentee effective control over the sale of that item. Indeed, a finding of contributory\ninfringement is normally the functional equivalent of holding that the disputed article is within\nthe monopoly granted to the patentee. n21\nn21 It seems extraordinary to suggest that the Copyright Act confers upon all\ncopyright owners collectively, much less the two respondents in this case, the exclusive\nright to distribute VTR's simply because they may be used to infringe copyrights. That,\nhowever, is the logical implication of their claim. The request for an injunction below\nindicates that respondents seek, in effect, to declare VTR's contraband. Their suggestion\nin this Court that a continuing royalty pursuant to a judicially created compulsory license\nwould be an acceptable remedy merely indicates that respondents, for their part, would\nbe willing to license their claimed monopoly interest in VTR's to Sony in return for a\nroyalty.\nFor that reason, in contributory infringement cases arising under the patent laws the Court\nhas always recognized the critical importance of not allowing the patentee to extend his\nmonopoly beyond the limits of his specific grant. These cases deny the patentee any right to\ncontrol the distribution of unpatented articles unless they are \"unsuited for any commercial\nnoninfringing use.\" Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Hass Co., 448 U.S. 176, 198 (1980).\nUnless a commodity \"has no use except through practice of the patented method,\" id., at 199,\nthe patentee has no right to claim that its distribution constitutes contributory infringement.\n\"To form the basis for contributory infringement the item must almost be uniquely suited as a\n\nIV\ncomponent of the patented invention.\" P. Rosenberg, Patent Law Fundamentals ß 17.02[2]\n(2d ed. 1982). \"[A] sale of an article which though adapted to an infringing use is also\nadapted to other and lawful uses, is not enough to make the seller a contributory infringer.\nSuch a rule would block the wheels of commerce.\" Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U.S. 1, 48\n(1912), overruled on other grounds, Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243\nU.S. 502, 517 (1917).\nWe recognize there are substantial differences between the patent and copyright laws. But in\nboth areas the contributory infringement doctrine is grounded on the recognition that adequate\nprotection of a monopoly may require the courts to look beyond actual duplication of a device\nor publication to the products or activities that make such duplication possible. The staple\narticle of commerce doctrine must strike a balance between a copyright holder's legitimate\ndemand for effective -- not merely symbolic -- protection of the statutory monopoly, and the\nrights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce. Accordingly,\nthe sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute\ncontributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable\npurposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.\nThe question is thus whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant\nnoninfringing uses. In order to resolve that question, we need not explore all the different\npotential uses of the machine and determine whether or not they would constitute\ninfringement. Rather, we need only consider whether on the basis of the facts as found by the\nDistrict Court a significant number of them would be noninfringing. Moreover, in order to\nresolve this case we need not give precise content to the question of how much use is\ncommercially significant. For one potential use of the Betamax plainly satisfies this standard,\nhowever it is understood: private, noncommercial time-shifting in the home. It does so both\n(A) because respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing it\nfor their programs, and (B) because the District Court's factual findings reveal that even the\nunauthorized home time-shifting of respondents' programs is legitimate fair use.\nA. Authorized Time-Shifting\nEach of the respondents owns a large inventory of valuable copyrights, but in the total\nspectrum of television programming their combined market share is small. The exact\npercentage is not specified, but it is well below 10%. n22 If they were to prevail, the outcome\nof this litigation would have a significant impact on both the producers and the viewers of the\nremaining 90% of the programming in the Nation. No doubt, many other producers share\nrespondents' concern about the possible consequences of unrestricted copying. Nevertheless\nthe findings of the District Court make it clear that time-shifting may enlarge the total viewing\naudience and that many producers are willing to allow private time-shifting to continue, at\nleast for an experimental time period. n23\nn22 The record suggests that Disney's programs at the time of trial consisted of\napproximately one hour a week of network television and one syndicated series.\nUniversal's percentage in the Los Angeles market on commercial television stations was\nunder 5%. See Tr. 532-533, 549-550.\nn23 The District Court did not make any explicit findings with regard to how much\nbroadcasting is wholly uncopyrighted. The record does include testimony that at least\none movie -- My Man Godfrey -- falls within that category, id., at 2300-2301, and certain\nbroadcasts produced by the Federal Government are also uncopyrighted. See 17 U. S.\n\nC. ß 105 (1982 ed.). Cf. Schnapper v. Foley, 215 U. S. App. D. C. 59, 667 F.2d 102\n(1981) (explaining distinction between work produced by the Government and work\ncommissioned by the Government). To the extent such broadcasting is now significant,\nit further bolsters our conclusion. Moreover, since copyright protection is not perpetual,\nthe number of audiovisual works in the public domain necessarily increases each year.\nThe District Court found:\n\"Even if it were deemed that home-use recording of copyrighted material constituted\ninfringement, the Betamax could still legally be used to record noncopyrighted material or\nmaterial whose owners consented to the copying. An injunction would deprive the public of the\nability to use the Betamax for this noninfringing off-the-air recording.\n\"Defendants introduced considerable testimony at trial about the potential for such copying\nof sports, religious, educational and other programming. This included testimony from\nrepresentatives of the Offices of the Commissioners of the National Football, Basketball,\nBaseball and Hockey Leagues and Associations, the Executive Director of National Religious\nBroadcasters and various educational communications agencies. Plaintiffs attack the weight of\nthe testimony offered and also contend that an injunction is warranted because infringing uses\noutweigh noninfringing uses.\n\"Whatever the future percentage of legal versus illegal home-use recording might be, an\ninjunction which seeks to deprive the public of the very tool or article of commerce capable of\nsome noninfringing use would be an extremely harsh remedy, as well as one unprecedented in\ncopyright law.\" 480 F.Supp., at 468.\nAlthough the District Court made these statements in the context of considering the\npropriety of injunctive relief, the statements constitute a finding that the evidence concerning\n\"sports, religious, educational and other programming\" was sufficient to establish a significant\nquantity of broadcasting whose copying is now authorized, and a significant potential for future\nauthorized copying. That finding is amply supported by the record. In addition to the religious\nand sports officials identified explicitly by the District Court, n24 two items in the record\ndeserve specific mention.\nn24 See Tr. 2447-2450 (Alexander Hadden, Major League Baseball); id., at 2480,\n2486-2487 (Jay Moyer, National Football League); id., at 2515-2516 (David Stern,\nNational Basketball Association); id., at 2530-2534 (Gilbert Stein, National Hockey\nLeague); id., at 2543-2552 (Thomas Hansen, National Collegiate Athletic Association);\nid., at 2565-2572 (Benjamin Armstrong, National Religious Broadcasters). Those officials\nwere authorized to be the official spokespersons for their respective institutions in this\nlitigation. Id., at 2432, 2479, 2509-2510, 2530, 2538, 2563. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n30(b)(6).\nFirst is the testimony of John Kenaston, the station manager of Channel 58, an educational\nstation in Los Angeles affiliated with the Public Broadcasting Service. He explained and\nauthenticated the station's published guide to its programs. n25 For each program, the guide\ntells whether unlimited home taping is authorized, home taping is authorized subject to certain\nrestrictions (such as erasure within seven days), or home taping is not authorized at all. The\nSpring 1978 edition of the guide described 107 programs. Sixty-two of those programs or\n58% authorize some home taping. Twenty-one of them or almost 20% authorize unrestricted\nhome taping. n26\n\nn25 Tr. 2863-2902; Defendants' Exh. PI.\nn26 See also Tr. 2833-2844 (similar testimony by executive director of New Jersey\nPublic Broadcasting Authority). Cf. id., at 2592-2605 (testimony by chief of New York\nEducation Department's Bureau of Mass Communications approving home taping for\neducational purposes).\nSecond is the testimony of Fred Rogers, president of the corporation that produces and\nowns the copyright on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The program is carried by more public\ntelevision stations than any other program. Its audience numbers over 3,000,000 families a\nday. He testified that he had absolutely no objection to home taping for noncommercial use\nand expressed the opinion that it is a real service to families to be able to record children's\nprograms and to show them at appropriate times. n27\nn27 \"Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the\n'Neighborhood' at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that it's a real service\nto families to be able to record such programs and show them at appropriate times. I\nhave always felt that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows people to\ntape the 'Neighborhood' off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the 'Neighborhood' because\nthat's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of\ntheir family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by\nothers. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been 'You are an important\nperson just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions.' Maybe I'm going on too\nlong, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of\nhis or her life, in a healthy way, is important.\" Id., at 2920-2921. See also Defendants'\nExh. PI, p. 85.\nIf there are millions of owners of VTR's who make copies of televised sports events,\nreligious broadcasts, and educational programs such as Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, and if\nthe proprietors of those programs welcome the practice, the business of supplying the\nequipment that makes such copying feasible should not be stifled simply because the\nequipment is used by some individuals to make unauthorized reproductions of respondents'\nworks. The respondents do not represent a class composed of all copyright holders. Yet a\nfinding of contributory infringement would inevitably frustrate the interests of broadcasters in\nreaching the portion of their audience that is available only through time-shifting.\nOf course, the fact that other copyright holders may welcome the practice of time-shifting does\nnot mean that respondents should be deemed to have granted a license to copy their\nprograms. Third-party conduct would be wholly irrelevant in an action for direct infringement\nof respondents' copyrights. But in an action for contributory infringement against the seller of\ncopying equipment, the copyright holder may not prevail unless the relief that he seeks affects\nonly his programs, or unless he speaks for virtually all copyright holders with an interest in the\noutcome. In this case, the record makes it perfectly clear that there are many important\nproducers of national and local television programs who find nothing objectionable about the\nenlargement in the size of the television audience that results from the practice of time-shifting\nfor private home use. n28 The seller of the equipment that expands those producers'\naudiences cannot be a contributory infringer if, as is true in this case, it has had no direct\ninvolvement with any infringing activity.\n\nn28 It may be rare for large numbers of copyright owners to authorize duplication of\ntheir works without demanding a fee from the copier. In the context of public\nbroadcasting, however, the user of the copyrighted work is not required to pay a fee for\naccess to the underlying work. The traditional method by which copyright owners\ncapitalize upon the television medium -- commercially sponsored free public broadcast\nover the public airwaves -- is predicated upon the assumption that compensation for the\nvalue of displaying the works will be received in the form of advertising revenues.\nIn the context of television programming, some producers evidently believe that\npermitting home viewers to make copies of their works off the air actually enhances the\nvalue of their copyrights. Irrespective of their reasons for authorizing the practice, they\ndo so, and in significant enough numbers to create a substantial market for a\nnoninfringing use of the Sony VTR's. No one could dispute the legitimacy of that market\nif the producers had authorized home taping of their programs in exchange for a license\nfee paid directly by the home user. The legitimacy of that market is not compromised\nsimply because these producers have authorized home taping of their programs without\ndemanding a fee from the home user. The copyright law does not require a copyright\nowner to charge a fee for the use of his works, and as this record clearly demonstrates,\nthe owner of a copyright may well have economic or noneconomic reasons for permitting\ncertain kinds of copying to occur without receiving direct compensation from the copier.\nIt is not the role of the courts to tell copyright holders the best way for them to exploit\ntheir copyrights: even if respondents' competitors were ill-advised in authorizing home\nvideotaping, that would not change the fact that they have created a substantial market\nfor a paradigmatic noninfringing use of Sony's product.\nB. Unauthorized Time-Shifting\nEven unauthorized uses of a copyrighted work are not necessarily infringing. An unlicensed use\nof the copyright is not an infringement unless it conflicts with one of the specific exclusive\nrights conferred by the copyright statute. Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S.,\nat 154-155. Moreover, the definition of exclusive rights in ß 106 of the present Act is prefaced\nby the words \"subject to sections 107 through 118.\" Those sections describe a variety of uses\nof copyrighted material that \"are not infringements of copyright\" \"notwithstanding the\nprovisions of section 106.\" The most pertinent in this case is ß 107, the legislative\nendorsement of the doctrine of \"fair use.\" n29\nn29 The Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 1075, did not have a \"fair use\" provision.\nAlthough that Act's compendium of exclusive rights \"to print, reprint, publish, copy, and\nvend the copyrighted work\" was broad enough to encompass virtually all potential\ninteractions with a copyrighted work, the statute was never so construed. The courts\nsimply refused to read the statute literally in every situation. When Congress amended\nthe statute in 1976, it indicated that it \"intended to restate the present judicial doctrine\nof fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way.\" H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p.\n66 (1976).\nThat section identifies various factors n30 that enable a court to apply an \"equitable rule of\nreason\" analysis to particular claims of infringement. n31 Although not conclusive, the first\nfactor requires that \"the commercial or nonprofit character of an activity\" be weighed in any\nfair use decision. n32 If the Betamax were used to make copies for a commercial or profit-\nmaking purpose, such use would presumptively be unfair. The contrary presumption is\nappropriate here, however, because the District Court's findings plainly establish that time\n\nshifting for private home use must be characterized as a noncommercial, nonprofit activity.\nMoreover, when one considers the nature of a televised copyrighted audiovisual work, see 17\nU. S. C. ß 107(2) (1982 ed.), and that time-shifting merely enables a viewer to see such a\nwork which he had been invited to witness in its entirety free of charge, the fact that the\nentire work is reproduced, see ß 107(3), does not have its ordinary effect of militating against\na finding of fair use. n33\nn30 Section 107 provides:\n\"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work,\nincluding such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means\nspecified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an\ninfringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any\nparticular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include -\n\"(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a\ncommercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n\"(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\"(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted\nwork as a whole; and\n\"(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted\nwork.\" 17 U. S. C. ß 107 (1982 ed.).\nn31 The House Report expressly stated that the fair use doctrine is an \"equitable rule\nof reason\" in its explanation of the fair use section:\n\"Although the courts have considered and ruled upon the fair use doctrine over and\nover again, no real definition of the concept has ever emerged. Indeed, since the\ndoctrine is an equitable rule of reason, no generally applicable definition is possible, and\neach case raising the question must be decided on its own facts. . . .\n. . . .\n\"General intention behind the provision\n\"The statement of the fair use doctrine in section 107 offers some guidance to users\nin determining when the principles of the doctrine apply. However, the endless variety\nof situations and combinations of circumstances that can rise in particular cases\nprecludes the formulation of exact rules in the statute. The bill endorses the purpose\nand general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze\nthe doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological change.\nBeyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria\napplicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a\ncase-by-case basis.\" H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, supra, at 65-66.\nThe Senate Committee similarly eschewed a rigid, bright-line approach to fair use.\nThe Senate Report endorsed the view \"that off-the-air recording for convenience\" could\nbe considered \"fair use\" under some circumstances, although it then made it clear that it\ndid not intend to suggest that off-the-air recording for convenience should be deemed\nfair use under any circumstances imaginable. S. Rep. No. 94-473, pp. 65-66 (1975).\nThe latter qualifying statement is quoted by the dissent, post, at 481, and if read in\nisolation, would indicate that the Committee intended to condemn all off-the-air\n\nrecording for convenience. Read in context, however, it is quite clear that that was the\nfarthest thing from the Committee's intention.\nn32 \"The Committee has amended the first of the criteria to be considered -- 'the\npurpose and character of the use' -- to state explicitly that this factor includes a\nconsideration of 'whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit\neducational purposes.' This amendment is not intended to be interpreted as any sort of\nnot-for-profit limitation on educational uses of copyrighted works. It is an express\nrecognition that, as under the present law, the commercial or non-profit character of an\nactivity, while not conclusive with respect to fair use, can and should be weighed along\nwith other factors in fair use decisions.\" H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, supra, at 66.\nn33 It has been suggested that \"consumptive uses of copyrights by home VTR users\nare commercial even if the consumer does not sell the homemade tape because the\nconsumer will not buy tapes separately sold by the copyrightholder.\" Home Recording of\nCopyrighted Works: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the\nAdministration of Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.,\npt. 2, p. 1250 (1982) (memorandum of Prof. Laurence H. Tribe). Furthermore, \"[the]\nerror in excusing such theft as noncommercial,\" we are told, \"can be seen by simple\nanalogy: jewel theft is not converted into a noncommercial veniality if stolen jewels are\nsimply worn rather than sold.\" Ibid. The premise and the analogy are indeed simple, but\nthey add nothing to the argument. The use to which stolen jewelry is put is quite\nirrelevant in determining whether depriving its true owner of his present possessory\ninterest in it is venial; because of the nature of the item and the true owner's interests in\nphysical possession of it, the law finds the taking objectionable even if the thief does not\nuse the item at all. Theft of a particular item of personal property of course may have\ncommercial significance, for the thief deprives the owner of his right to sell that\nparticular item to any individual. Time-shifting does not even remotely entail\ncomparable consequences to the copyright owner. Moreover, the time-shifter no more\nsteals the program by watching it once than does the live viewer, and the live viewer is\nno more likely to buy prerecorded videotapes than is the time-shifter. Indeed, no live\nviewer would buy a prerecorded videotape if he did not have access to a VTR.\nThis is not, however, the end of the inquiry because Congress has also directed us to\nconsider \"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\"\nß 107(4). The purpose of copyright is to create incentives for creative effort. Even copying\nfor noncommercial purposes may impair the copyright holder's ability to obtain the rewards\nthat Congress intended him to have. But a use that has no demonstrable effect upon the\npotential market for, or the value of, the copyrighted work need not be prohibited in order to\nprotect the author's incentive to create. The prohibition of such noncommercial uses would\nmerely inhibit access to ideas without any countervailing benefit. n34\nn34 Cf. A. Latman, Fair Use of Copyrighted Works (1958), reprinted in Study No. 14\nfor the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Copyright Law Revision, Studies Prepared for\nthe Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 30\n(1960):\n\n\"In certain situations, the copyright owner suffers no substantial harm from the use of\nhis work. . . . Here again, is the partial marriage between the doctrine of fair use and\nthe legal maxim de minimus non curat lex.\"\nThus, although every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair\nexploitation of the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright,\nnoncommercial uses are a different matter. A challenge to a noncommercial use of a\ncopyrighted work requires proof either that the particular use is harmful, or that if it should\nbecome widespread, it would adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work.\nActual present harm need not be shown; such a requirement would leave the copyright holder\nwith no defense against predictable damage. Nor is it necessary to show with certainty that\nfuture harm will result. What is necessary is a showing by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat some meaningful likelihood of future harm exists. If the intended use is for commercial\ngain, that likelihood may be presumed. But if it is for a noncommercial purpose, the likelihood\nmust be demonstrated.\nIn this case, respondents failed to carry their burden with regard to home time-shifting.\nThe District Court described respondents' evidence as follows:\n\"Plaintiffs' experts admitted at several points in the trial that the time-shifting without\nlibrarying would result in 'not a great deal of harm.' Plaintiffs' greatest concern about time-\nshifting is with 'a point of important philosophy that transcends even commercial judgment.'\nThey fear that with any Betamax usage, 'invisible boundaries' are passed: 'the copyright owner\nhas lost control over his program.'\" 480 F.Supp., at 467.\nLater in its opinion, the District Court observed:\n\"Most of plaintiffs' predictions of harm hinge on speculation about audience viewing patterns\nand ratings, a measurement system which Sidney Sheinberg, MCA's president, calls a 'black\nart' because of the significant level of imprecision involved in the calculations.\" Id., at 469.\nn35\nn35 See also 480 F.Supp., at 451:\n\"It should be noted, however, that plaintiffs' argument is more complicated and\nspeculative than was the plaintiff's in Williams & Wilkins. . . . Here, plaintiffs ask the\ncourt to find harm based on many more assumptions. . . . As is discussed more fully in\nPart IV infra, some of these assumptions are based on neither fact nor experience, and\nplaintiffs admit that they are to some extent inconsistent and illogical.\"\nThere was no need for the District Court to say much about past harm. \"Plaintiffs have\nadmitted that no actual harm to their copyrights has occurred to date.\" Id., at 451.\nOn the question of potential future harm from time-shifting, the District Court offered a\nmore detailed analysis of the evidence. It rejected respondents' \"fear that persons 'watching'\nthe original telecast of a program will not be measured in the live audience and the ratings and\nrevenues will decrease,\" by observing that current measurement technology allows the\nBetamax audience to be reflected. Id., at 466. n36 It rejected respondents' prediction \"that\nlive television or movie audiences will decrease as more people watch Betamax tapes as an\nalternative,\" with the observation that \"[there] is no factual basis for [the underlying]\nassumption.\" Ibid. n37 It rejected respondents' \"fear that time-shifting will reduce audiences\nfor telecast reruns,\" and concluded instead that \"given current market practices, this should\n\naid plaintiffs rather than harm them.\" Ibid. n38 And it declared that respondents' suggestion\nthat \"theater or film rental exhibition of a program will suffer because of time-shift recording of\nthat program\" \"lacks merit.\" Id., at 467. n39\nn36 \"There was testimony at trial, however, that Nielsen Ratings has already\ndeveloped the ability to measure when a Betamax in a sample home is recording the\nprogram. Thus, the Betamax owner will be measured as a part of the live audience. The\nlater diary can augment that measurement with information about subsequent viewing.\"\nId., at 466.\nIn a separate section, the District Court rejected plaintiffs' suggestion that the\ncommercial attractiveness of television broadcasts would be diminished because\nBetamax owners would use the pause button or fast-forward control to avoid viewing\nadvertisements:\n\"It must be remembered, however, that to omit commercials, Betamax owners must\nview the program, including the commercials, while recording. To avoid commercials\nduring playback, the viewer must fast-forward and, for the most part, guess as to when\nthe commercial has passed. For most recordings, either practice may be too tedious. As\ndefendants' survey showed, 92% of the programs were recorded with commercials and\nonly 25% of the owners fast-forward through them. Advertisers will have to make the\nsame kinds of judgments they do now about whether persons viewing televised\nprograms actually watch the advertisements which interrupt them.\" Id., at 468.\nn37 \"Here plaintiffs assume that people will view copies when they would otherwise\nbe watching television or going to the movie theater. There is no factual basis for this\nassumption. It seems equally likely that Betamax owners will play their tapes when\nthere is nothing on television they wish to see and no movie they want to attend.\nDefendants' survey does not show any negative effect of Betamax ownership on\ntelevision viewing or theater attendance.\" Id., at 466.\nn38 \"The underlying assumptions here are particularly difficult to accept. Plaintiffs\nexplain that the Betamax increases access to the original televised material and that the\nmore people there are in this original audience, the fewer people the rerun will attract.\nYet current marketing practices, including the success of syndication, show just the\nopposite. Today, the larger the audience for the original telecast, the higher the price\nplaintiffs can demand from broadcasters from rerun rights. There is no survey within the\nknowledge of this court to show that the rerun audience is comprised of persons who\nhave not seen the program. In any event, if ratings can reflect Betamax recording,\noriginal audiences may increase and, given market practices, this should aid plaintiffs\nrather than harm them.\" Ibid.\nn39 \"This suggestion lacks merit. By definition, time-shift recording entails viewing\nand erasing, so the program will no longer be on tape when the later theater run begins.\nOf course, plaintiffs may fear that the Betamax owners will keep the tapes long enough\nto satisfy all their interest in the program and will, therefore, not patronize later theater\nexhibitions. To the extent that this practice involves librarying, it is addressed in section\nV. C., infra. It should also be noted that there is no evidence to suggest that the public\n\ninterest in later theatrical exhibitions of motion pictures will be reduced any more by\nBetamax recording than it already is by the television broadcast of the film.\" Id., at 467.\nAfter completing that review, the District Court restated its overall conclusion several\ntimes, in several different ways. \"Harm from time-shifting is speculative and, at best,\nminimal.\" Ibid. \"The audience benefits from the time-shifting capability have already been\ndiscussed. It is not implausible that benefits could also accrue to plaintiffs, broadcasters, and\nadvertisers, as the Betamax makes it possible for more persons to view their broadcasts.\" Ibid.\n\"No likelihood of harm was shown at trial, and plaintiffs admitted that there had been no actual\nharm to date.\" Id., at 468-469. \"Testimony at trial suggested that Betamax may require\nadjustments in marketing strategy, but it did not establish even a likelihood of harm.\" Id., at\n469. \"Television production by plaintiffs today is more profitable than it has ever been, and, in\nfive weeks of trial, there was no concrete evidence to suggest that the Betamax will change\nthe studios' financial picture.\" Ibid.\nThe District Court's conclusions are buttressed by the fact that to the extent time-shifting\nexpands public access to freely broadcast television programs, it yields societal benefits. In\nCommunity Television of Southern California v. Gottfried, 459 U.S. 498, 508, n. 12 (1983), we\nacknowledged the public interest in making television broadcasting more available.\nConcededly, that interest is not unlimited. But it supports an interpretation of the concept of\n\"fair use\" that requires the copyright holder to demonstrate some likelihood of harm before he\nmay condemn a private act of time-shifting as a violation of federal law.\nWhen these factors are all weighed in the \"equitable rule of reason\" balance, we must conclude\nthat this record amply supports the District Court's conclusion that home time-shifting is fair\nuse. In light of the findings of the District Court regarding the state of the empirical data, it is\nclear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the statute as presently written bars such\nconduct. n40\nn40 The Court of Appeals chose not to engage in any \"equitable rule of reason\"\nanalysis in this case. Instead, it assumed that the category of \"fair use\" is rigidly\ncircumscribed by a requirement that every such use must be \"productive.\" It therefore\nconcluded that copying a television program merely to enable the viewer to receive\ninformation or entertainment that he would otherwise miss because of a personal\nscheduling conflict could never be fair use. That understanding of \"fair use\" was\nerroneous.\nCongress has plainly instructed us that fair use analysis calls for a sensitive balancing\nof interests. The distinction between \"productive\" and \"unproductive\" uses may be\nhelpful in calibrating the balance, but it cannot be wholly determinative. Although\ncopying to promote a scholarly endeavor certainly has a stronger claim to fair use than\ncopying to avoid interrupting a poker game, the question is not simply two-dimensional.\nFor one thing, it is not true that all copyrights are fungible. Some copyrights govern\nmaterial with broad potential secondary markets. Such material may well have a\nbroader claim to protection because of the greater potential for commercial harm.\nCopying a news broadcast may have a stronger claim to fair use than copying a motion\npicture. And, of course, not all uses are fungible. Copying for commercial gain has a\nmuch weaker claim to fair use than copying for personal enrichment. But the notion of\nsocial \"productivity\" cannot be a complete answer to this analysis. A teacher who copies\nto prepare lecture notes is clearly productive. But so is a teacher who copies for the\nsake of broadening his personal understanding of his specialty. Or a legislator who\ncopies for the sake of broadening her understanding of what her constituents are\n\nV\nwatching; or a constituent who copies a news program to help make a decision on how\nto vote.\nMaking a copy of a copyrighted work for the convenience of a blind person is\nexpressly identified by the House Committee Report as an example of fair use, with no\nsuggestion that anything more than a purpose to entertain or to inform need motivate\nthe copying. In a hospital setting, using a VTR to enable a patient to see programs he\nwould otherwise miss has no productive purpose other than contributing to the\npsychological well-being of the patient. Virtually any time-shifting that increases viewer\naccess to television programming may result in a comparable benefit. The statutory\nlanguage does not identify any dichotomy between productive and nonproductive time-\nshifting, but does require consideration of the economic consequences of copying.\nIn summary, the record and findings of the District Court lead us to two conclusions. First,\nSony demonstrated a significant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders who\nlicense their works for broadcast on free television would not object to having their broadcasts\ntime-shifted by private viewers. And second, respondents failed to demonstrate that time-\nshifting would cause any likelihood of nonminimal harm to the potential market for, or the\nvalue of, their copyrighted works. The Betamax is, therefore, capable of substantial\nnoninfringing uses. Sony's sale of such equipment to the general public does not constitute\ncontributory infringement of respondents' copyrights.\n\"The direction of Art. I is that Congress shall have the power to promote the progress of\nscience and the useful arts. When, as here, the Constitution is permissive, the sign of how far\nCongress has chosen to go can come only from Congress.\" Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram\nCorp., 406 U.S. 518, 530 (1972).\nOne may search the Copyright Act in vain for any sign that the elected representatives of\nthe millions of people who watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a program\nfor later viewing at home, or have enacted a flat prohibition against the sale of machines that\nmake such copying possible.\nIt may well be that Congress will take a fresh look at this new technology, just as it so\noften has examined other innovations in the past. But it is not our job to apply laws that have\nnot yet been written. Applying the copyright statute, as it now reads, to the facts as they have\nbeen developed in this case, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\nDISSENTBY:\nBLACKMUN\nDISSENT:\nJUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE\nREHNQUIST join, dissenting.\nA restatement of the facts and judicial history of this case is necessary, in my view, for a\nproper focus upon the issues. Respondents' position is hardly so \"unprecedented,\" ante, at\n421, in the copyright law, nor does it really embody a \"gross generalization,\" ante, at 436, or a\n\"novel theory of liability,\" ante, at 437, and the like, as the Court, in belittling their claims,\ndescribes the efforts of respondents.\n\nI\nThe introduction of the home videotape recorder (VTR) upon the market has enabled\nmillions of Americans to make recordings of television programs in their homes, for future and\nrepeated viewing at their own convenience. While this practice has proved highly popular with\nowners of television sets and VTR's, it understandably has been a matter of concern for the\nholders of copyrights in the recorded programs. A result is the present litigation, raising the\nissues whether the home recording of a copyrighted television program is an infringement of\nthe copyright, and, if so, whether the manufacturers and distributors of VTR's are liable as\ncontributory infringers. I would hope that these questions ultimately will be considered\nseriously and in depth by the Congress and be resolved there, despite the fact that the Court's\ndecision today provides little incentive for congressional action. Our task in the meantime,\nhowever, is to resolve these issues as best we can in the light of ill-fitting existing copyright\nlaw.\nIt is no answer, of course, to refer to and stress, as the Court does, this Court's\n\"consistent deference to Congress\" whenever \"major technological innovations\" appear. Ante,\nat 431. Perhaps a better and more accurate description is that the Court has tended to evade\nthe hard issues when they arise in the area of copyright law. I see no reason for the Court to\nbe particularly pleased with this tradition or to continue it. Indeed, it is fairly clear from the\nlegislative history of the 1976 Act that Congress meant to change the old pattern and enact a\nstatute that would cover new technologies, as well as old.\nII\nIn 1976, respondents Universal City Studios, Inc., and Walt Disney Productions (Studios)\nbrought this copyright infringement action in the United States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California against, among others, petitioners Sony Corporation, a Japanese\ncorporation, and Sony Corporation of America, a New York corporation, the manufacturer and\ndistributor, respectively, of the Betamax VTR. The Studios sought damages, profits, and a\nwide-ranging injunction against further sales or use of the Betamax or Betamax tapes.\nThe Betamax, like other VTR's, presently is capable of recording television broadcasts off\nthe air on videotape cassettes, and playing them back at a later time. n1 Two kinds of\nBetamax usage are at issue here. n2 The first is \"time-shifting,\" whereby the user records a\nprogram in order to watch it at a later time, and then records over it, and thereby erases the\nprogram, after a single viewing. The second is \"library-building,\" in which the user records a\nprogram in order to keep it for repeated viewing over a longer term. Sony's advertisements,\nat various times, have suggested that Betamax users \"record favorite shows\" or \"build a\nlibrary.\" Sony's Betamax advertising has never contained warnings about copyright\ninfringement, although a warning does appear in the Betamax operating instructions.\nn1 The Betamax has three primary components: a tuner that receives television\n(\"RF\") signals broadcast over the airwaves; an adapter that converts the RF signals into\naudio-video signals; and a recorder that places the audio-video signals on magnetic tape.\nSony also manufactures VTR's without built-in tuners; these are capable of playing back\nprerecorded tapes and recording home movies on videotape, but cannot record off the\nair. Since the Betamax has its own tuner, it can be used to record off one channel while\nanother channel is being watched.\nThe Betamax is available with auxiliary features, including a timer, a pause control,\nand a fast-forward control, these allow Betamax owners to record programs without\nbeing present, to avoid (if they are present) recording commercial messages, and to skip\n\nover commercials while playing back the recording. Videotape is reusable; the user\nerases its record by recording over it.\nn2 This case involves only the home recording for home use of television programs\nbroadcast free over the airwaves. No issue is raised concerning cable or pay television,\nor the sharing or trading of tapes.\nThe Studios produce copyrighted \"movies\" and other works that they release to theaters\nand license for television broadcast. They also rent and sell their works on film and on\nprerecorded videotapes and videodiscs. License fees for television broadcasts are set\naccording to audience ratings, compiled by rating services that do not measure any playbacks\nof videotapes. The Studios make the serious claim that VTR recording may result in a\ndecrease in their revenue from licensing their works to television and from marketing them in\nother ways.\nAfter a 5-week trial, the District Court, with a detailed opinion, ruled that home VTR\nrecording did not infringe the Studios' copyrights under either the Act of Mar. 4, 1909 (1909\nAct), 35 Stat. 1075, as amended (formerly codified as 17 U. S. C. ß 1 et seq.), or the\nCopyright Revision Act of 1976 (1976 Act), 90 Stat. 2541, 17 U. S. C. ß 101 et seq. (1982\ned.). n3 The District Court also held that even if home VTR recording were an infringement,\nSony could not be held liable under theories of direct infringement, contributory infringement,\nor vicarious liability. Finally, the court concluded that an injunction against sales of the\nBetamax would be inappropriate even if Sony were liable under one or more of those theories.\n480 F.Supp. 429 (1979).\nn3 At the trial, the Studios proved 32 individual instances where their copyrighted\nworks were recorded on Betamax VTR's. Two of these instances occurred after January\n1, 1978, the primary effective date of the 1976 Act; all the others occurred while the\n1909 Act was still effective. My analysis focuses primarily on the 1976 Act, but the\nprinciples governing copyright protection for these works are the same under either Act.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in virtually every respect.\n659 F.2d 963 (1981). It held that the 1909 Act and the 1976 Act contained no implied\nexemption for \"home use\" recording, that such recording was not \"fair use,\" and that the use\nof the Betamax to record the Studios' copyrighted works infringed their copyrights. The Court\nof Appeals also held Sony liable for contributory infringement, reasoning that Sony knew and\nanticipated that the Betamax would be used to record copyrighted material off the air, and that\nSony, indeed, had induced, caused, or materially contributed to the infringing conduct. The\nCourt of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for appropriate relief; it suggested\nthat the District Court could consider the award of damages or a continuing royalty in lieu of an\ninjunction. Id., at 976.\nThe Copyright Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, ß 8, cl. 8, empowers Congress \"To\npromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and\nInventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\" This Nation's initial\ncopyright statute was passed by the First Congress.

The most important of\nthese sections, for present purposes, is ß 107; that section states that \"the fair use of a\ncopyrighted work . . . is not an infringement of copyright.\" n8\nn6 Section 106 provides:\n\n\"Subject to sections 107 through 118, the owner of copyright under this title has the\nexclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:\n\"(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;\n\"(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n\"(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale\nor other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;\n\"(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes,\nand motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work\npublicly; and\n\"(5) in the case literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes,\nand pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion\npicture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly.\"\nn7 A \"phonorecord\" is defined by ß 101 as a reproduction of sounds other than\nsounds accompanying an audiovisual work, while a \"copy\" is a reproduction of a work in\nany form other than a phonorecord.\nn8 Section 107 provides:\n\"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work,\nincluding such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means\nspecified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an\ninfringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any\nparticular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include -\n\"(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a\ncommercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n\"(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\"(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted\nwork as a whole; and\n\"(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted\nwork.\"\nSection 101 makes it clear that the four factors listed in this section are \"illustrative and\nnot limitative.\"\nThe 1976 Act, like its predecessors, n9 does not give the copyright owner full and\ncomplete control over all possible uses of his work. If the work is put to some use not\nenumerated in ß 106, the use is not an infringement. See Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists\nTelevision, Inc., 392 U.S. 390, 393-395 (1968). Thus, before considering whether home\nvideotaping comes within the scope of the fair use exemption, one first must inquire whether\nthe practice appears to violate the exclusive right, granted in the first instance by ß 106(1),\n\"to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords.\"\n\nn9 The 1976 Act was the product of a revision effort lasting more than 20 years.\nSpurred by the recognition that \"significant developments in technology and\ncommunications\" had rendered the 1909 Act inadequate, S. Rep. No. 94-473, p. 47\n(1975); see H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 47 (1976), Congress in 1955 authorized the\nCopyright Office to prepare a series of studies on all aspects of the existing copyright\nlaw. Thirty-four studies were prepared and presented to Congress. The Register of\nCopyrights drafted a comprehensive report with recommendations, House Committee on\nthe Judiciary, Copyright Law Revision, Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. (Comm. Print 1961)\n(Register's 1961 Report), and general revision bills were introduced near the end of the\n88th Congress in 1964. H. R. 11947/S. 3008, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964). The\nRegister issued a second report in 1965, with revised recommendations. House\nCommittee on the Judiciary, Copyright Law Revision, pt. 6, Supplementary Report of the\nRegister of Copyrights on the General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law: 1965 Revision\nBill, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (Comm. Print 1965) (Register's Supplementary Report).\nAction on copyright revision was delayed from 1967 to 1974 by a dispute on cable\ntelevision, see generally Second Supplementary Report of the Register of Copyrights on\nthe General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law: 1975 Revision Bill, ch. V, pp. 2-26 (Draft\nOct.-Dec. 1975) (Register's Second Supplementary Report), but a compromise led to\npassage of the present Act in 1976.\nA\nAlthough the word \"copies\" is in the plural in ß 106(1), there can be no question that\nunder the Act the making of even a single unauthorized copy is prohibited. The Senate and\nHouse Reports explain: \"The references to 'copies or phonorecords,' although in the plural, are\nintended here and throughout the bill to include the singular (1 U. S. C. ß 1).\" n10 S. Rep.\nNo. 94-473, p. 58 (1975) (1975 Senate Report); H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 61 (1976) (1976\nHouse Report). The Reports then describe the reproduction right established by ß 106(1):\n\"[The] right 'to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords' means the right to\nproduce a material object in which the work is duplicated, transcribed, imitated, or simulated\nin a fixed form from which it can be 'perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either\ndirectly or with the aid of a machine or device.' As under the present law, a copyrighted work\nwould be infringed by reproducing it in whole or in any substantial part, and by duplicating it\nexactly or by imitation or simulation.\" 1975 Senate Report 58; 1976 House Report 61.\nThe making of even a single videotape recording at home falls within this definition; the VTR\nuser produces a material object from which the copyrighted work later can be perceived.\nUnless Congress intended a special exemption for the making of a single copy for personal use,\nI must conclude that VTR recording is contrary to the exclusive rights granted by ß 106(1).\nn10 Title 1 U. S. C. ß 1 provides in relevant part:\n\"In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates\notherwise . . . words importing the plural include the singular . . . .\"\nThe 1976 Act and its accompanying Reports specify in some detail the situations in which a\nsingle copy of a copyrighted work may be made without infringement concerns. Section\n108(a), for example, permits a library or archives \"to reproduce no more than one copy or\nphonorecord of a work\" for a patron, but only under very limited conditions; an entire work,\nmoreover, can be copied only if it cannot be obtained elsewhere at a fair price. n11 ß 108(e);\n\nsee also ß 112(a) (broadcaster may \"make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a\nparticular transmission program,\" and only under certain conditions). In other respects, the\nmaking of single copies is permissible only within the limited confines of the fair use doctrine.\nThe Senate Report, in a section headed \"Single and multiple copying,\" notes that the fair use\ndoctrine would permit a teacher to make a single copy of a work for use in the classroom, but\nonly if the work was not a \"sizable\" one such as a novel or treatise. 1975 Senate Report 63\n64; accord, 1976 House Report 68-69, 71. Other situations in which the making of a single\ncopy would be fair use are described in the House and Senate Reports. n12 But neither the\nstatute nor its legislative history suggests any intent to create a general exemption for a single\ncopy made for personal or private use.\nn11 The library photocopying provisions of ß 108 do not excuse any person who\nrequests \"a copy\" from a library if the requester's use exceeds fair use. ß 108(f)(2).\nMoreover, a library is absolved from liability for the unsupervised use of its copying\nequipment provided that the equipment bears a notice informing users that \"the making\nof a copy\" may violate the copyright law. ß 108(f)(1).\nn12 For example, \"the making of a single copy or phonorecord by an individual as a\nfree service for a blind person\" would be a fair use, as would \"a single copy reproduction\nof an excerpt from a copyrighted work by a calligrapher for a single client\" or \"a single\nreproduction of excerpts from a copyrighted work by a student calligrapher or teacher in\na learning situation.\" 1975 Senate Report 66-67; see 1976 House Report 73-74.\nApplication of the fair use doctrine in these situations, of course, would be unnecessary if\nthe 1976 Act created a general exemption for the making of a single copy.\nIndeed, it appears that Congress considered and rejected the very possibility of a special\nprivate use exemption. The issue was raised early in the revision process, in one of the studies\nprepared for Congress under the supervision of the Copyright Office. A. Latman, Fair Use of\nCopyrighted Works (1958), reprinted in Study No. 14 for the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, Copyright Law Revision, Studies Prepared for the Subcommittee on Patents,\nTrademarks, and Copyrights, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1960) (Latman Fair Use Study). This\nstudy found no reported case supporting the existence of an exemption for private use,\nalthough it noted that \"the purpose and nature of a private use, and in some cases the small\namount taken, might lead a court to apply the general principles of fair use in such a way as to\ndeny liability.\" Id., at 12. After reviewing a number of foreign copyright laws that contained\nexplicit statutory exemptions for private or personal use, id., at 25, Professor Latman outlined\nseveral approaches that a revision bill could take to the general issue of exemptions and fair\nuse. One of these was the adoption of particularized rules to cover specific situations, including\n\"the field of personal use.\" Id., at 33. n13\nn13 Professor Latman made special mention of the \"personal use\" issue because the\narea was one that \"has become disturbed by recent developments . . . .\nPhotoduplication devices may make authors' and publishers' groups apprehensive. The\nCopyright Charter recently approved by [the International Confederation of Societies of\nAuthors and Composers] emphasizes the concern of authors over 'private' uses which,\nbecause of technological developments, are said to be competing seriously with the\nauthor's economic interests.\" Latman Fair Use Study 33-34.\n\nRejecting the latter alternative, the Register of Copyrights recommended that the revised\ncopyright statute simply mention the doctrine of fair use and indicate its general scope. The\nRegister opposed the adoption of rules and exemptions to cover specific situations, n14\npreferring, instead, to rely on the judge-made fair use doctrine to resolve new problems as\nthey arose. See Register's 1961 Report 25; Register's Supplementary Report 27-28.\nn14 The one exemption proposed by the Register, permitting a library to make a\nsingle photocopy of an out-of-print work and of excerpts that a requester certified were\nneeded for research, met with opposition and was not included in the bills initially\nintroduced in Congress. See Register's 1961 Report 26; H. R. 11947/S. 3008, 88th\nCong., 2d Sess. (1964); Register's Supplementary Report 26. A library copying provision\nwas restored to the bill in 1969, after pressure from library associations. Register's\nSecond Supplementary Report, ch. III, pp. 10-11; see S. 543, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., ß\n108 (Comm. Print, Dec. 10, 1969); 1975 Senate Report 48.\nThe Register's approach was reflected in the first copyright revision bills, drafted by the\nCopyright Office in 1964. These bills, like the 1976 Act, granted the copyright owner the\nexclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work, subject only to the exceptions set out in\nlater sections. H. R. 11947/S. 3008, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., ß 5(a) (1964). The primary\nexception was fair use, ß 6, containing language virtually identical to ß 107 of the 1976 Act.\nAlthough the copyright revision bills underwent change in many respects from their first\nintroduction in 1964 to their final passage in 1976, these portions of the bills did not change.\nn15 I can conclude only that Congress, like the Register, intended to rely on the fair use\ndoctrine, and not on a per se exemption for private use, to separate permissible copying from\nthe impermissible. n16\nn15 The 1964 bills provided that the fair use of copyrighted material for purposes\n\"such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research\" was not\nan infringement of copyright, and listed four \"factors to be considered\" in determining\nwhether any other particular use was fair. H. R. 11947/S. 3008, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., ß\n6 (1964). Revised bills, drafted by the Copyright Office in 1965, contained a fair use\nprovision merely mentioning the doctrine but not indicating its scope: \"Notwithstanding\nthe provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringement of\ncopyright.\" H. R. 4347/S. 1006, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., ß 107 (1965). The House\nJudiciary Committee restored the provision to its earlier wording, H. R. Rep. No. 2237,\n89th Cong., 2d Sess., 5, 58 (1966), and the language adopted by the Committee\nremained in the bill in later Congresses. See H. R. 2512/S. 597, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., ß\n107 (1967); S. 543, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., ß 107 (1969); S. 644, 92d Cong., 1st Sess.,\nß 107 (1971); S. 1361, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., ß 107 (1973); H. R. 2223/S. 22, 94th\nCong., 1st Sess., ß 107 (1975). With a few additions by the House Judiciary Committee\nin 1976, see 1976 House Report 5; H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 94-1733, p. 70 (1976), the\nsame language appears in ß 107 of the 1976 Act.\nn16 In Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 203 Ct. Cl. 74, 487 F.2d 1345 (1973),\naff'd by an equally divided Court, 420 U.S. 376 (1975), decided during the process of the\nrevision of the copyright statutes, the Court of Claims suggested that copying for\npersonal use might be outside the scope of copyright protection under the 1909 Act. The\ncourt reasoned that because \"hand copying\" for personal use has always been regarded\n\nas permissible, and because the practice of making personal copies continued after\ntypewriters and photostat machines were developed, the making of personal copies by\nmeans other than hand copying should be permissible as well. 203 Ct. Cl., at 84-88, 487\nF.2d, at 1350-1352.\nThere appear to me to be several flaws in this reasoning. First, it is by no means\nclear that the making of a \"hand copy\" of an entire work is permissible; the most that\ncan be said is that there is no reported case on the subject, possibly because no\ncopyright owner ever thought it worthwhile to sue. See Latman Fair Use Study 11-12; 3\nM. Nimmer, Copyright ß 13.05[E][4][a] (1983). At least one early treatise asserted that\ninfringement would result \"if an individual made copies for his personal use, even in his\nown handwriting, as there is no rule of law excepting manuscript copies from the law of\ninfringement.\" A. Weil, American Copyright Law ß 1066 (1917). Second, hand copying\nor even copying by typewriter is self-limiting. The drudgery involved in making hand\ncopies ordinarily ensures that only necessary and fairly small portions of a work are\ntaken; it is unlikely that any user would make a hand copy as a substitute for one that\ncould be purchased. The harm to the copyright owner from hand copying thus is\nminimal. The recent advent of inexpensive and readily available copying machines,\nhowever, has changed the dimensions of the problem. See Register's Second\nSupplementary Report, ch. III, p. 3; Hearings on H. R. 2223 before the Subcommittee on\nCourts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 194 (1975) (1975 House Hearings) (remarks of Rep.\nDanielson); id., at 234 (statement of Robert W. Cairns); id., at 250 (remarks of Rep.\nDanielson); id., at 354 (testimony of Irwin Karp); id., at 467 (testimony of Rondo\nCameron); id., at 1795 (testimony of Barbara Ringer, Register of Copyrights). Thus,\n\"[the] supposition that there is no tort involved in a scholar copying a copyrighted text\nby hand does not much advance the question of machine copying.\" B. Kaplan, An\nUnhurried View of Copyright 101-102 (1967).\nWhen Congress intended special and protective treatment for private use, moreover, it\nsaid so explicitly. One such explicit statement appears in ß 106 itself. The copyright owner's\nexclusive right to perform a copyrighted work, in contrast to his right to reproduce the work in\ncopies, is limited. Section 106(4) grants a copyright owner the exclusive right to perform the\nwork \"publicly,\" but does not afford the owner protection with respect to private performances\nby others. A motion picture is \"performed\" whenever its images are shown or its sounds are\nmade audible. ß 101. Like \"[singing] a copyrighted lyric in the shower,\" Twentieth Century\nMusic Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 155 (1975), watching television at home with one's family\nand friends is now considered a performance. 1975 Senate Report 59-60; 1976 House Report\n63. n17 Home television viewing nevertheless does not infringe any copyright -- but only\nbecause ß 106(4) contains the word \"publicly.\" n18 See generally 1975 Senate Report 60-61;\n1976 House Report 63-64; Register's 1961 Report 29-30. No such distinction between public\nand private uses appears in ß 106(1)'s prohibition on the making of copies. n19\nn17 In a trio of cases, Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U.S.\n390, 398 (1968); Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U.S.\n394, 403-405 (1974); and Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151 (1975),\nthis Court had held that the reception of a radio or television broadcast was not a\n\"performance\" under the 1909 Act. The Court's \"narrow construction\" of the word\n\"perform\" was \"completely overturned by the [1976 Act] and its broad definition of\n'perform' in section 101.\" 1976 House Report 87.\n\nn18 A work is performed \"publicly\" if it takes place \"at a place open to the public or\nat any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family\nand its social acquaintances is gathered.\" ß 101.\nn19 One purpose of the exemption for private performances was to permit the home\nviewing of lawfully made videotapes. The Register noted in 1961 that \"[new] technical\ndevices will probably make it practical in the future to reproduce televised motion\npictures in the home. We do not believe the private use of such a reproduction can or\nshould be precluded by copyright.\" Register's 1961 Report 30 (emphasis added). The\nRegister did not suggest that the private making of a reproduction of a televised motion\npicture would be permitted by the copyright law. The Register later reminded Congress\nthat \"[in] general the concept of 'performance' must be distinguished sharply from the\nreproduction of copies.\" Register's Supplementary Report 22.\nSimilarly, an explicit reference to private use appears in ß 108. Under that section, a\nlibrary can make a copy for a patron only for specific types of private use: \"private study,\nscholarship, or research.\" n20 ß ß 108(d)(1) and (e)(1); see 37 CFR ß 201.14(b) (1983).\nLimits also are imposed on the extent of the copying and the type of institution that may make\ncopies, and the exemption expressly is made inapplicable to motion pictures and certain other\ntypes of works. ß 108(h). These limitations would be wholly superfluous if an entire copy of\nany work could be made by any person for private use. n21\nn20 During hearings on this provision, Representative Danielson inquired whether it\nwould apply to works of fiction such as \"Gone With the Wind,\" or whether it was limited\nto \"strictly technical types of information.\" The uncontradicted response was that it would\napply only in \"general terms of science . . . [and] the useful arts.\" 1975 House Hearings\n251 (testimony of Robert W. Cairns); cf. id., at 300 (statement of Harry Rosenfield) (\"We\nare not asking . . . for the right to copy 'Gone With the Wind'\").\nn21 The mention in the Senate and House Reports of situations in which copies for\nprivate use would be permissible under the fair use doctrine -- for example, the making\nof a free copy for a blind person, 1975 Senate Report 66; 1976 House Report 73, or the\n\"recordings of performances by music students for purposes of analysis and criticism,\"\n1975 Senate Report 63 -- would be superfluous as well. See n. 12, supra.\nB\nThe District Court in this case nevertheless concluded that the 1976 Act contained an\nimplied exemption for \"home-use recording.\" 480 F.Supp., at 444-446. The court relied\nprimarily on the legislative history of a 1971 amendment to the 1909 Act, a reliance that this\nCourt today does not duplicate. Ante, at 430, n. 11. That amendment, however, was\naddressed to the specific problem of commercial piracy of sound recordings. Act of Oct. 15,\n1971, 85 Stat. 391 (1971 Amendment). The House Report on the 1971 Amendment, in a\nsection entitled \"Home Recording,\" contains the following statement:\n\"In approving the creation of a limited copyright in sound recordings it is the intention of\nthe Committee that this limited copyright not grant any broader rights than are accorded to\nother copyright proprietors under the existing title 17. Specifically, it is not the intention of the\nCommittee to restrain the home recording, from broadcasts or from tapes or records, of\nrecorded performances, where the home recording is for private use and with no purpose of\n\nreproducing or otherwise capitalizing commercially on it. This practice is common and\nunrestrained today, and the record producers and performers would be in no different position\nfrom that of the owners of copyright in recorded musical compositions over the past 20 years.\"\nH. R. Rep. No. 92-487, p. 7 (1971) (1971 House Report).\nSimilar statements were made during House hearings on the bill n22 and on the House floor,\nn23 although not in the Senate proceedings. In concluding that these statements created a\ngeneral exemption for home recording, the District Court, in my view, paid too little heed to\nthe context in which the statements were made, and failed to consider the limited purpose of\nthe 1971 Amendment and the structure of the 1909 Act.\nn22 The following exchange took place during the testimony of Barbara Ringer, then\nAssistant Register of Copyrights:\n\"[Rep.] BIESTER. . . . I can tell you I must have a small pirate in my own home. My\nson has a cassette tape recorder, and as a particular record becomes a hit, he will\nretrieve it onto his little set. . . . [This] legislation, of course, would not point to his\nactivities, would it?\n\"Miss RINGER. I think the answer is clearly, 'No, it would not.' I have spoken at a\ncouple of seminars on video cassettes lately, and this question is usually asked: 'What\nabout the home recorders?' The answer I have given and will give again is that this is\nsomething you cannot control. You simply cannot control it. My own opinion, whether\nthis is philosophical dogma or not, is that sooner or later there is going to be a crunch\nhere. But that is not what this legislation is addressed to, and I do not see the crunch\ncoming in the immediate future. . . . I do not see anybody going into anyone's home\nand preventing this sort of thing, or forcing legislation that would engineer a piece of\nequipment not to allow home taping.\" Hearings on S. 646 and H. R. 6927 before\nSubcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., 22\n23 (1971) (1971 House Hearings).\nn23 Shortly before passage of the bill, a colloquy took place between Representative\nKastenmeier, Chairman of the House Subcommittee that produced the bill, and\nRepresentative Kazen, who was not on the Subcommittee:\n\"Mr. KAZEN. Am I correct in assuming that the bill protects copyrighted material that\nis duplicated for commercial purposes only?\n\"Mr. KASTENMEIER. Yes.\n\"Mr. KAZEN. In other words, if your child were to record off of a program which\ncomes through the air on the radio or television, and then used it for her own personal\npleasure, for listening pleasure, this use would not be included under the penalties of this\nbill?\n\"Mr. KASTENMEIER. This is not included in the bill. I am glad the gentleman raises\nthe point.\n\"On page 7 of the report, under 'Home Recordings,' Members will note that under the\nbill the same practice which prevails today is called for; namely, this is considered both\npresently and under the proposed law to be fair use. The child does not do this for\ncommercial purposes. This is made clear in the report.\" 117 Cong. Rec. 34748-34749\n(1971).\n\nUnlike television broadcasts and other types of motion pictures, sound recordings were not\nprotected by copyright prior to the passage of the 1971 Amendment. Although the underlying\nmusical work could be copyrighted, the 1909 Act provided no protection for a particular\nperformer's rendition of the work. Moreover, copyrighted musical works that had been\nrecorded for public distribution were subject to a \"compulsory license\": any person was free to\nrecord such a work upon payment of a 2-cent royalty to the copyright owner. ß 1(e), 35 Stat.\n1075-1076. While reproduction without payment of the royalty was an infringement under the\n1909 Act, damages were limited to three times the amount of the unpaid royalty. ß 25(e), 35\nStat. 1081-1082; Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. Goody, 248 F.2d 260, 262-263, 265 (CA2 1957),\ncert. denied, 355 U.S. 952 (1958). It was observed that the practical effect of these provisions\nwas to legalize record piracy. See S. Rep. No. 92-72, p. 4 (1971); 1971 House Report 2.\nIn order to suppress this piracy, the 1971 Amendment extended copyright protection\nbeyond the underlying work and to the sound recordings themselves. Congress chose,\nhowever, to provide only limited protection: owners of copyright in sound recordings were\ngiven the exclusive right \"[to] reproduce [their works] and distribute [them] to the public.\"\n1971 Amendment, ß 1(a), 85 Stat. 391 (formerly codified as 17 U. S. C. ß 1(f)). n24 This\nright was merely the right of commercial distribution. See 117 Cong. Rec. 34748-34749\n(1971) (colloquy of Reps. Kazen and Kastenmeier) (\"the bill protects copyrighted material that\nis duplicated for commercial purposes only\").\nn24 The 1909 Act's grant of an exclusive right to \"copy,\" ß 1(a), was of no\nassistance to the owner of a copyright in a sound recording, because a reproduction of a\nsound recording was technically considered not to be a \"copy.\" See 1971 House Hearings\n18 (testimony of Barbara Ringer, Assistant Register of Copyrights); 1971 Amendment, ß\n1(e), 85 Stat. 391 (formerly codified as 17 U. S. C. ß 26) (\"For the purposes of\n[specified sections, not including ß 1(a)], but not for any other purpose, a reproduction\nof a [sound recording] shall be considered to be a copy thereof\"). This concept is carried\nforward into the 1976 Act, which distinguishes between \"copies\" and \"phonorecords.\"\nSee n. 7, supra.\nAgainst this background, the statements regarding home recording under the 1971\nAmendment appear in a very different light. If home recording was \"common and\nunrestrained\" under the 1909 Act, see 1971 House Report 7, it was because sound recordings\nhad no copyright protection and the owner of a copyright in the underlying musical work could\ncollect no more than a 2-cent royalty plus 6 cents in damages for each unauthorized use. With\nso little at stake, it is not at all surprising that the Assistant Register \"[did] not see anybody\ngoing into anyone's home and preventing this sort of thing.\" 1971 House Hearings 23.\nBut the references to home sound recording in the 1971 Amendment's legislative history\ndemonstrate no congressional intent to create a generalized home-use exemption from\ncopyright protection. Congress, having recognized that the 1909 Act had been unsuccessful in\ncontrolling home sound recording, addressed only the specific problem of commercial record\npiracy. To quote Assistant Register Ringer again, home use was \"not what this legislation\n[was] addressed to.\" Id., at 22. n25\nn25 During consideration of the 1976 Act, Congress, of course, was well aware of the\nlimited nature of the protection granted to sound recordings under the 1971\nAmendment. See 1975 House Hearings 113 (testimony of Barbara Ringer, Register of\n\nCopyrights) (1971 Amendment \"created a copyright in a sound recording . . . but limited\nit to the particular situation of so-called piracy\"); id., at 1380 (letter from John Lorenz,\nActing Librarian of Congress) (under 1971 Amendment \"only the unauthorized\nreproduction and distribution to the public of copies of the sound recording is prohibited.\nThus, the duplication of sound recordings for private, personal use and the performance\nof sound recordings through broadcasting or other means are outside the scope of the\namendment\").\nWhile the 1971 Amendment narrowed the sound recordings loophole in then existing\ncopyright law, motion pictures and other audiovisual works have been accorded full copyright\nprotection since at least 1912, see Act of Aug. 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 488, and perhaps before, see\nEdison v. Lubin, 122 F. 240 (CA3 1903), appeal dism'd, 195 U.S. 625 (1904). Congress\ncontinued this protection in the 1976 Act. Unlike the sound recording rights created by the\n1971 Amendment, the reproduction rights associated with motion pictures under ß 106(1) are\nnot limited to reproduction for public distribution; the copyright owner's right to reproduce the\nwork exists independently, and the \"mere duplication of a copy may constitute an infringement\neven if it is never distributed.\" Register's Supplementary Report 16; see 1975 Senate Report\n57 and 1976 House Report 61. Moreover, the 1976 Act was intended as a comprehensive\ntreatment of all aspects of copyright law. The Reports accompanying the 1976 Act, unlike the\n1971 House Report, contain no suggestion that home-use recording is somehow outside the\nscope of this all-inclusive statute. It was clearly the intent of Congress that no additional\nexemptions were to be implied. n26\nn26 Representative Kastenmeier, the principal House sponsor of the 1976 revision bill\nand Chairman of the House Subcommittee that produced it, made this explicit on the\nopening day of the House hearings:\n\"[From] time to time, certain areas have not been covered in the bill. But is it not\nthe case, this being a unified code, that the operation of the bill does apply whether or\nnot we specifically deal with a subject or not? . . .\n\"Therefore, we can really not fail to deal with an issue. It will be dealt with one way\nor the other. The code, title 17, will cover it. So we have made a conscientious decision\neven by omission. . . .\n. . . .\n\". . . By virtue of passing this bill, we will deal with every issue. Whether we deal\nwith it completely or not for the purpose of resolving the issues involved is the only\nquestion, not whether it has dealt with the four corners of the bill because the four\ncorners of the bill will presume to deal with everything in copyright.\" Id., at 115.\nI therefore find in the 1976 Act no implied exemption to cover the home taping of\ntelevision programs, whether it be for a single copy, for private use, or for home use. Taping a\ncopyrighted television program is infringement unless it is permitted by the fair use exemption\ncontained in ß 107 of the 1976 Act. I now turn to that issue.\nFair Use\nThe doctrine of fair use has been called, with some justification, \"the most troublesome in\nthe whole law of copyright.\" Dellar v. Samuel Goldwyn, Inc., 104 F.2d 661, 662 (CA2 1939);\nsee Triangle Publications, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc., 626 F.2d 1171, 1174 (CA5\nIV\n\n1980); Meeropol v. Nizer, 560 F.2d 1061, 1068 (CA2 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1013\n(1978). Although courts have constructed lists of factors to be considered in determining\nwhether a particular use is fair, n27 no fixed criteria have emerged by which that\ndetermination can be made. This Court thus far has provided no guidance; although fair use\nissues have come here twice, on each occasion the Court was equally divided and no opinion\nwas forthcoming. Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 203 Ct. Cl. 74, 487 F.2d 1345\n(1973), aff'd, 420 U.S. 376 (1975); Benny v. Loew's Inc., 239 F.2d 532 (CA9 1956), aff'd sub\nnom. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Loew's Inc., 356 U.S. 43 (1958).\nn27 The precise phrase \"fair use\" apparently did not enter the case law until 1869,\nsee Lawrence v. Dana, 15 F. Cas. 26, 60 (No. 8,136) (CC Mass.), but the doctrine itself\nfound early expression in Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342 (No. 4,901) (CC Mass. 1841).\nJustice Story was faced there with the \"intricate and embarrassing [question]\" whether a\nbiography containing copyrighted letters was \"a justifiable use of the original materials,\nsuch as the law recognizes as no infringement of the copyright of the plaintiffs.\" Id., at\n344, 348. In determining whether the use was permitted, it was necessary, said Justice\nStory, to consider \"the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value\nof the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or\ndiminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work. . . . Much must, in\nsuch cases, depend upon the nature of the new work, the value and extent of the copies,\nand the degree in which the original authors may be injured thereby.\" Id., at 348-349.\nSimilar lists were compiled by later courts. See, e. g., Tennessee Fabricating Co. v.\nMoultrie Mfg. Co., 421 F.2d 279, 283 (CA5), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 928 (1970); Mathews\nConveyer Co. v. Palmer-Bee Co., 135 F.2d 73, 85 (CA6 1943); Columbia Pictures Corp.\nv. National Broadcasting Co., 137 F.Supp. 348 (SD Cal. 1955); Shapiro, Bernstein & Co.\nv. P. F. Collier & Son Co., 26 USPQ 40, 43 (SDNY 1934); Hill v. Whalen & Martell, Inc.,\n220 F. 359, 360 (SDNY 1914).\nNor did Congress provide definitive rules when it codified the fair use doctrine in the 1976\nAct; it simply incorporated a list of factors \"to be considered\": the \"purpose and character of\nthe use,\" the \"nature of the copyrighted work,\" the \"amount and substantiality of the portion\nused,\" and, perhaps the most important, the \"effect of the use upon the potential market for or\nvalue of the copyrighted work\" (emphasis supplied). ß 107. No particular weight, however,\nwas assigned to any of these, and the list was not intended to be exclusive. The House and\nSenate Reports explain that ß 107 does no more than give \"statutory recognition\" to the fair\nuse doctrine; it was intended \"to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change,\nnarrow, or enlarge it in any way.\" 1976 House Report 66. See 1975 Senate Report 62; S. Rep.\nNo. 93-983, p. 116 (1974); H. R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 32 (1967); H. R. Rep.\nNo. 2237, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 61 (1966).\nA\nDespite this absence of clear standards, the fair use doctrine plays a crucial role in the law\nof copyright. The purpose of copyright protection, in the words of the Constitution, is to\n\"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.\" Copyright is based on the belief that by\ngranting authors the exclusive rights to reproduce their works, they are given an incentive to\ncreate, and that \"encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to\nadvance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in 'Science and the useful\nArts.'\" Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 219 (1954). The monopoly created by copyright thus\nrewards the individual author in order to benefit the public. Twentieth Century Music Corp. v.\n\nAiken, 422 U.S., at 156; Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123, 127-128 (1932); see H. R.\nRep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).\nThere are situations, nevertheless, in which strict enforcement of this monopoly would\ninhibit the very \"Progress of Science and useful Arts\" that copyright is intended to promote.\nAn obvious example is the researcher or scholar whose own work depends on the ability to\nrefer to and to quote the work of prior scholars. Obviously, no author could create a new work\nif he were first required to repeat the research of every author who had gone before him. n28\nThe scholar, like the ordinary user, of course could be left to bargain with each copyright\nowner for permission to quote from or refer to prior works. But there is a crucial difference\nbetween the scholar and the ordinary user. When the ordinary user decides that the owner's\nprice is too high, and forgoes use of the work, only the individual is the loser. When the\nscholar forgoes the use of a prior work, not only does his own work suffer, but the public is\ndeprived of his contribution to knowledge. The scholar's work, in other words, produces\nexternal benefits from which everyone profits. In such a case, the fair use doctrine acts as a\nform of subsidy -- albeit at the first author's expense -- to permit the second author to make\nlimited use of the first author's work for the public good. See Latman Fair Use Study 31;\nGordon, Fair Use as Market Failure: A Structural Analysis of the Betamax Case and its\nPredecessors, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 1600, 1630 (1982).\nn28 \"The world goes ahead because each of us builds on the work of our\npredecessors. 'A dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant can see farther than the\ngiant himself.'\" Chafee, Reflections on the Law of Copyright: I, 45 Colum. L. Rev. 503,\n511 (1945).\nA similar subsidy may be appropriate in a range of areas other than pure scholarship. The\nsituations in which fair use is most commonly recognized are listed in ß 107 itself; fair use\nmay be found when a work is used \"for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, . . . scholarship, or research.\" The House and Senate Reports expand on this list\nsomewhat, n29 and other examples may be found in the case law. n30 Each of these uses,\nhowever, reflects a common theme: each is a productive use, resulting in some added benefit\nto the public beyond that produced by the first author's work. n31 The fair use doctrine, in\nother words, permits works to be used for \"socially laudable purposes.\" See Copyright Office,\nBriefing Papers on Current Issues, reprinted in 1975 House Hearings 2051, 2055. I am aware\nof no case in which the reproduction of a copyrighted work for the sole benefit of the user has\nbeen held to be fair use. n32\nn29 Quoting from the Register's 1961 Report, the Senate and House Reports give\nexamples of possible fair uses:\n\"'quotation of excerpts in a review or criticism for purposes of illustration or comment;\nquotation of short passages in a scholarly or technical work, for illustration or clarification\nof the author's observations; use in a parody of some of the content of the work\nparodied; summary of an address or article, with brief quotations, in a news report;\nreproduction by a library of a portion of a work to replace part of a damaged copy;\nreproduction by a teacher or student of a small part of a work to illustrate a lesson;\nreproduction of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports; incidental and\nfortuitous reproduction, in a newsreel or broadcast, of a work located in the scene of an\nevent being reported.'\" 1975 Senate Report 61-62; 1976 House Report 65.\n\nn30 See, e. g., Triangle Publications, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Inc., 626\nF.2d 1171 (CA5 1980) (comparative advertising).\nn31 Professor Seltzer has characterized these lists of uses as \"[reflecting] what in\nfact the subject matter of fair use has in the history of its adjudication consisted in: it\nhas always had to do with the use by a second author of a first author's work.\" L.\nSeltzer, Exemptions and Fair Use in Copyright 24 (1978) (emphasis removed). He\ndistinguishes \"the mere reproduction of a work in order to use it for its intrinsic purpose\n- to make what might be called the 'ordinary' use of it.\" When copies are made for\n\"ordinary\" use of the work, \"ordinary infringement has customarily been triggered, not\nnotions of fair use\" (emphasis in original). Ibid. See also 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright ß\n13.05[A][1] (1983) (\"Use of a work in each of the foregoing contexts either necessarily\nor usually involves its use in a derivative work\").\nn32 Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 203 Ct. Cl. 74, 487 F.2d 1345 (1973),\naff'd by an equally divided Court, 420 U.S. 376 (1975), involved the photocopying of\nscientific journal articles; the Court of Claims stressed that the libraries performing the\ncopying were \"devoted solely to the advancement and dissemination of medical\nknowledge,\" 203 Ct. Cl., at 91, 487 F.2d, at 1354, and that \"medical science would be\nseriously hurt if such library photocopying were stopped.\" Id., at 95, 487 F.2d, at 1356.\nThe issue of library copying is now covered by ß 108 of the 1976 Act. That section,\nwhich Congress regarded as \"[authorizing] certain photocopying practices which may not\nqualify as a fair use,\" 1975 Senate Report 67; 1976 House Report 74, permits the\nmaking of copies only for \"private study, scholarship, or research.\" ß ß 108(d)(1) and\n(e)(1).\nI do not suggest, of course, that every productive use is a fair use. A finding of fair use still\nmust depend on the facts of the individual case, and on whether, under the circumstances, it is\nreasonable to expect the user to bargain with the copyright owner for use of the work. The\nfair use doctrine must strike a balance between the dual risks created by the copyright system:\non the one hand, that depriving authors of their monopoly will reduce their incentive to create,\nand, on the other, that granting authors a complete monopoly will reduce the creative ability of\nothers. n33 The inquiry is necessarily a flexible one, and the endless variety of situations that\nmay arise precludes the formulation of exact rules. But when a user reproduces an entire work\nand uses it for its original purpose, with no added benefit to the public, the doctrine of fair use\nusually does not apply. There is then no need whatsoever to provide the ordinary user with a\nfair use subsidy at the author's expense.\nn33 In the words of Lord Mansfield: \"[We] must take care to guard against two\nextremes equally prejudicial; the one, that men of ability, who have employed their time\nfor the service of the community, may not be deprived of their just merits, and the\nreward of their ingenuity and labour; the other, that the world may not be deprived of\nimprovements, nor the progress of the arts be retarded.\" Sayre v. Moore, as set forth in\nCary v. Longman, 1 East 358, 361, n. (b), 102 Eng. Rep. 138, 140, n. (b) (K. B. 1785).\nSee Register's Supplementary Report 13.\nThe making of a videotape recording for home viewing is an ordinary rather than a\nproductive use of the Studios' copyrighted works. The District Court found that \"Betamax\nowners use the copy for the same purpose as the original. They add nothing of their own.\"\n\n480 F.Supp., at 453. Although applying the fair use doctrine to home VTR recording, as Sony\nargues, may increase public access to material broadcast free over the public airwaves, I think\nSony's argument misconceives the nature of copyright. Copyright gives the author a right to\nlimit or even to cut off access to his work. Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S., at 127. A VTR\nrecording creates no public benefit sufficient to justify limiting this right. Nor is this right\nextinguished by the copyright owner's choice to make the work available over the airwaves.\nSection 106 of the 1976 Act grants the copyright owner the exclusive right to control the\nperformance and the reproduction of his work, and the fact that he has licensed a single\ntelevision performance is really irrelevant to the existence of his right to control its\nreproduction. Although a television broadcast may be free to the viewer, this fact is equally\nirrelevant; a book borrowed from the public library may not be copied any more freely than a\nbook that is purchased.\nIt may be tempting, as, in my view, the Court today is tempted, to stretch the doctrine of\nfair use so as to permit unfettered use of this new technology in order to increase access to\ntelevision programming. But such an extension risks eroding the very basis of copyright law,\nby depriving authors of control over their works and consequently of their incentive to create.\nn34 Even in the context of highly productive educational uses, Congress has avoided this\ntemptation; in passing the 1976 Act, Congress made it clear that off-the-air videotaping was to\nbe permitted only in very limited situations. See 1976 House Report 71; 1975 Senate Report\n64. And, the Senate Report adds, \"[the] committee does not intend to suggest . . . that off-\nthe-air recording for convenience would under any circumstances, be considered 'fair use.'\"\nId., at 66. I cannot disregard these admonitions.\nn34 This point was brought home repeatedly by the Register of Copyrights.\nMentioning the \"multitude of technological developments\" since passage of the 1909 Act,\nincluding \"remarkable developments in the use of video tape,\" Register's Supplementary\nReport xiv-xv, the Register cautioned:\n\"I realize, more clearly now than I did in 1961, that the revolution in communications\nhas brought with it a serious challenge to the author's copyright. This challenge comes\nnot only from the ever-growing commercial interests who wish to use the author's works\nfor private gain. An equally serious attack has come from people with a sincere interest\nin the public welfare who fully recognize . . . 'that the real heart of civilization . . . owes\nits existence to the author'; ironically, in seeking to make the author's works widely\navailable by freeing them from copyright restrictions, they fail to realize that they are\nwhittling away the very thing that nurtures authorship in the first place. An\naccommodation among conflicting demands must be worked out, true enough, but not\nby denying the fundamental constitutional directive: to encourage cultural progress by\nsecuring the author's exclusive rights to him for a limited time.\" Id., at xv; see 1975\nHouse Hearings 117 (testimony of Barbara Ringer, Register of Copyrights).\nB\nI recognize, nevertheless, that there are situations where permitting even an unproductive\nuse would have no effect on the author's incentive to create, that is, where the use would not\naffect the value of, or the market for, the author's work. Photocopying an old newspaper\nclipping to send to a friend may be an example; pinning a quotation on one's bulletin board\nmay be another. In each of these cases, the effect on the author is truly de minimis. Thus,\neven though these uses provide no benefit to the public at large, no purpose is served by\npreserving the author's monopoly, and the use may be regarded as fair.\n\nCourts should move with caution, however, in depriving authors of protection from\nunproductive \"ordinary\" uses. As has been noted above, even in the case of a productive use,\nß 107(4) requires consideration of \"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or\nvalue of the copyrighted work\" (emphasis added). \"[A] particular use which may seem to have\nlittle or no economic impact on the author's rights today can assume tremendous importance\nin times to come.\" Register's Supplementary Report 14. Although such a use may seem\nharmless when viewed in isolation, \"[isolated] instances of minor infringements, when\nmultiplied many times, become in the aggregate a major inroad on copyright that must be\nprevented.\" 1975 Senate Report 65.\nI therefore conclude that, at least when the proposed use is an unproductive one, a\ncopyright owner need prove only a potential for harm to the market for or the value of the\ncopyrighted work. See 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright ß 13.05[E][4][c], p. 13-84 (1983). Proof of\nactual harm, or even probable harm, may be impossible in an area where the effect of a new\ntechnology is speculative, and requiring such proof would present the \"real danger . . . of\nconfining the scope of an author's rights on the basis of the present technology so that, as the\nyears go by, his copyright loses much of its value because of unforeseen technical advances.\"\nRegister's Supplementary Report 14. Infringement thus would be found if the copyright owner\ndemonstrates a reasonable possibility that harm will result from the proposed use. When the\nuse is one that creates no benefit to the public at large, copyright protection should not be\ndenied on the basis that a new technology that may result in harm has not yet done so.\nThe Studios have identified a number of ways in which VTR recording could damage their\ncopyrights. VTR recording could reduce their ability to market their works in movie theaters\nand through the rental or sale of prerecorded videotapes or videodiscs; it also could reduce\ntheir rerun audience, and consequently the license fees available to them for repeated\nshowings. Moreover, advertisers may be willing to pay for only \"live\" viewing audiences, if\nthey believe VTR viewers will delete commercials or if rating services are unable to measure\nVTR use; if this is the case, VTR recording could reduce the license fees the Studios are able to\ncharge even for first-run showings. Library-building may raise the potential for each of the\ntypes of harm identified by the Studios, and time-shifting may raise the potential for\nsubstantial harm as well. n35\nn35 A VTR owner who has taped a favorite movie for repeated viewing will be less\nlikely to rent or buy a tape containing the same movie, watch a televised rerun, or pay to\nsee the movie at a theater. Although time-shifting may not replace theater or rerun\nviewing or the purchase of prerecorded tapes or discs, it may well replace rental usage;\na VTR user who has recorded a first-run movie for later viewing will have no need to rent\na copy when he wants to see it. Both library-builders and time-shifters may avoid\ncommercials; the library-builder may use the pause control to record without them, and\nall users may fast-forward through commercials on playback.\nThe Studios introduced expert testimony that both time-shifting and librarying would\ntend to decrease their revenue from copyrighted works. See 480 F.Supp., at 440. The\nDistrict Court's findings also show substantial library-building and avoidance of\ncommercials. Both sides submitted surveys showing that the average Betamax user\nowns between 25 and 32 tapes. The Studios' survey showed that at least 40% of users\nhad more than 10 tapes in a \"library\"; Sony's survey showed that more than 40% of\nusers planned to view their tapes more than once; and both sides' surveys showed that\ncommercials were avoided at least 25% of the time. Id., at 438-439.\n\nAlthough the District Court found no likelihood of harm from VTR use, 480 F.Supp., at 468,\nI conclude that it applied an incorrect substantive standard and misallocated the burden of\nproof. The District Court reasoned that the Studios had failed to prove that library-building\nwould occur \"to any significant extent,\" id., at 467; that the Studios' prerecorded videodiscs\ncould compete with VTR recordings and were \"arguably . . . more desirable,\" ibid.; that it was\n\"not clear that movie audiences will decrease,\" id., at 468; and that the practice of deleting\ncommercials \"may be too tedious\" for many viewers, ibid. To the extent any decrease in\nadvertising revenues would occur, the court concluded that the Studios had \"marketing\nalternatives at hand to recoup some of that predicted loss.\" Id., at 452. Because the Studios'\nprediction of harm was \"based on so many assumptions and on a system of marketing which is\nrapidly changing,\" the court was \"hesitant to identify 'probable effects' of home-use copying.\"\nIbid.\nThe District Court's reluctance to engage in prediction in this area is understandable, but,\nin my view, the court was mistaken in concluding that the Studios should bear the risk created\nby this uncertainty. The Studios have demonstrated a potential for harm, which has not been,\nand could not be, refuted at this early stage of technological development.\nThe District Court's analysis of harm, moreover, failed to consider the effect of VTR\nrecording on \"the potential market for or the value of the copyrighted work,\" as required by ß\n107(4). n36 The requirement that a putatively infringing use of a copyrighted work, to be\n\"fair,\" must not impair a \"potential\" market for the work has two implications. First, an\ninfringer cannot prevail merely by demonstrating that the copyright holder suffered no net\nharm from the infringer's action. Indeed, even a showing that the infringement has resulted in\na net benefit to the copyright holder will not suffice. Rather, the infringer must demonstrate\nthat he had not impaired the copyright holder's ability to demand compensation from (or to\ndeny access to) any group who would otherwise be willing to pay to see or hear the\ncopyrighted work. Second, the fact that a given market for a copyrighted work would not be\navailable to the copyright holder were it not for the infringer's activities does not permit the\ninfringer to exploit that market without compensating the copyright holder. See Iowa State\nUniversity Research Foundation, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., 621 F.2d 57 (CA2 1980).\nn36 Concern over the impact of a use upon \"potential\" markets is to be found in\ncases decided both before and after ß 107 lent Congress' imprimatur to the judicially\ncreated doctrine of fair use. See, e. g., Iowa State University Research Foundation, Inc.\nv. American Broadcasting Cos., 621 F.2d 57, 60 (CA2 1980) (\"the effect of the use on\nthe copyright holder's potential market for the work\"); Meeropol v. Nizer, 560 F.2d 1061,\n1070 (CA2 1977) (\"A key issue in fair use cases is whether the defendant's work tends to\ndiminish or prejudice the potential sale of plaintiff's work\"), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1013\n(1978); Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 203 Ct. Cl., at 88, 487 F.2d, at 1352\n(\"the effect of the use on a copyright owner's potential market for and value of his\nwork\"); Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corp. v. Crooks, 542 F.Supp. 1156, 1173\n(WDNY 1982) (\"[The] concern here must be focused on a copyrighted work's potential\nmarket. It is perfectly possible that plaintiffs' profits would have been greater, but for\nthe kind of videotaping in question\") (emphasis in original).\nIn this case, the Studios and their amici demonstrate that the advent of the VTR technology\ncreated a potential market for their copyrighted programs. That market consists of those\npersons who find it impossible or inconvenient to watch the programs at the time they are\nbroadcast, and who wish to watch them at other times. These persons are willing to pay for\nthe privilege of watching copyrighted work at their convenience, as is evidenced by the fact\nthat they are willing to pay for VTR's and tapes; undoubtedly, most also would be willing to\n\nV\npay some kind of royalty to copyright holders. The Studios correctly argue that they have been\ndeprived of the ability to exploit this sizable market.\nIt is thus apparent from the record and from the findings of the District Court that time-\nshifting does have a substantial adverse effect upon the \"potential market for\" the Studios'\ncopyrighted works. Accordingly, even under the formulation of the fair use doctrine advanced\nby Sony, time-shifting cannot be deemed a fair use.\nContributory Infringement\nFrom the Studios' perspective, the consequences of home VTR recording are the same as if\na business had taped the Studios' works off the air, duplicated the tapes, and sold or rented\nthem to members of the public for home viewing. The distinction is that home VTR users do\nnot record for commercial advantage; the commercial benefit accrues to the manufacturer and\ndistributors of the Betamax. I thus must proceed to discuss whether the manufacturer and\ndistributors can be held contributorily liable if the product they sell is used to infringe.\nIt is well established that liability for copyright infringement can be imposed on persons\nother than those who actually carry out the infringing activity. Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,\n222 U.S. 55, 62-63 (1911); 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright ß 12.04[A] (1983); see Twentieth\nCentury Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S., at 160, n. 11; Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Realty Co., 283\nU.S. 191, 198 (1931). Although the liability provision of the 1976 Act provides simply that\n\"[anyone] who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner . . . is an infringer of\nthe copyright,\" 17 U. S. C. ß 501(a) (1982 ed.), the House and Senate Reports demonstrate\nthat Congress intended to retain judicial doctrines of contributory infringement. 1975 Senate\nReport 57; 1976 House Report 61. n37\nn37 This intent is manifested further by provisions of the 1976 Act that exempt from\nliability persons who, while not participating directly in any infringing activity, could\notherwise be charged with contributory infringement. See ß 108(f)(1) (library not liable\n\"for the unsupervised use of reproducing equipment located on its premises,\" provided\nthat certain warnings are posted); ß 110(6) (\"governmental body\" or \"nonprofit\nagricultural or horticultural organization\" not liable for infringing performance by\nconcessionaire \"in the course of an annual agricultural or horticultural fair or exhibition\").\nThe doctrine of contributory copyright infringement, however, is not well defined. One of\nthe few attempts at definition appears in Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists\nManagement, Inc., 443 F.2d 1159 (CA2 1971). In that case the Second Circuit stated that \"one\nwho, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the\ninfringing conduct of another, may be held liable as a 'contributory' infringer.\" Id., at 1162\n(footnote omitted). While I have no quarrel with this general statement, it does not easily\nresolve the present case; the District Court and the Court of Appeals, both purporting to apply\nit, reached diametrically opposite results.\nA\nIn absolving Sony from liability, the District Court reasoned that Sony had no direct\ninvolvement with individual Betamax users, did not participate in any off-the-air copying, and\ndid not know that such copying was an infringement of the Studios' copyright. 480 F.Supp., at\n460. I agree with the Gershwin court that contributory liability may be imposed even when the\ndefendant has no formal control over the infringer. The defendant in Gershwin was a concert\npromoter operating through local concert associations that it sponsored; it had no formal\n\ncontrol over the infringing performers themselves. 443 F.2d, at 1162-1163. See also\nTwentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S., at 160, n. 11. Moreover, a finding of\ncontributory infringement has never depended on actual knowledge of particular instances of\ninfringement; it is sufficient that the defendant have reason to know that infringement is\ntaking place. 443 F.2d, at 1162; see Screen Gems-Columbia Music, Inc. v. Mark-Fi Records,\nInc., 256 F.Supp. 399 (SDNY 1966). n38 In the so-called \"dance hall\" cases, in which\nquestions of contributory infringement arise with some frequency, proprietors of entertainment\nestablishments routinely are held liable for unauthorized performances on their premises, even\nwhen they have no knowledge that copyrighted works are being performed. In effect, the\nproprietors in those cases are charged with constructive knowledge of the performances. n39\nn38 In Screen Gems, on which the Gershwin court relied, the court held that liability\ncould be imposed on a shipper of unauthorized \"bootleg\" records and a radio station that\nbroadcast advertisements of the records, provided they knew or should have known that\nthe records were infringing. The court concluded that the records' low price and the\nmanner in which the records were marketed could support a finding of \"constructive\nknowledge\" even if actual knowledge were not shown.\nn39 See, e. g., Famous Music Corp. v. Bay State Harness Horse Racing & Breeding\nAssn., Inc., 554 F.2d 1213 (CA1 1977); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro, Bernstein\n& Co., 36 F.2d 354 (CA7 1929); M. Witmark & Sons v. Tremont Social & Athletic Club,\n188 F.Supp. 787, 790 (Mass. 1960); see also Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken,\n422 U.S. 151, 157 (1975); Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Realty Co., 283 U.S. 191, 198-199\n(1931); 3 M. Nimmer, Copyright ß 12.04[A], p. 12-35 (1983).\nCourts have premised liability in these cases on the notion that the defendant had the\nability to supervise or control the infringing activities, see, e. g., Shapiro, Bernstein & Co.\nv. H. L. Green Co., 316 F.2d 304, 307 (CA2 1963); KECA Music, Inc. v. Dingus McGee's\nCo., 432 F.Supp. 72, 74 (WD Mo. 1977). This notion, however, is to some extent\nfictional; the defendant cannot escape liability by instructing the performers not to play\ncopyrighted music, or even by inserting a provision to that effect into the performers'\ncontract. Famous Music Corp. v. Bay State Harness Horse Racing & Breeding Assn., Inc.,\n554 F.2d, at 1214-1215; KECA Music, Inc. v. Dingus McGee's Co., 432 F.Supp., at 75;\nShapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. Veltin, 47 F.Supp. 648, 649 (WD La. 1942). Congress\nexpressly rejected a proposal to exempt proprietors from this type of liability under the\n1976 Act. See 1975 Senate Report 141-142; 1976 House Report 159-160; 1975 House\nHearings 1812-1813 (testimony of Barbara Ringer, Register of Copyrights); id., at 1813\n(colloquy between Rep. Pattison and Barbara Ringer).\nThe Court's attempt to distinguish these cases on the ground of \"control,\" ante, at\n437, is obviously unpersuasive. The direct infringer ordinarily is not employed by the\nperson held liable; instead, he is an independent contractor. Neither is he always an\nagent of the person held liable; Screen Gems makes this apparent.\nNor is it necessary that the defendant be aware that the infringing activity violates the\ncopyright laws. Section 504(c)(2) of the 1976 Act provides for a reduction in statutory\ndamages when an infringer proves he \"was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or\nher acts constituted an infringement of copyright,\" but the statute establishes no general\nexemption for those who believe their infringing activities are legal. Moreover, such an\nexemption would be meaningless in a case such as this, in which prospective relief is sought;\n\nonce a court has established that the copying at issue is infringement, the defendants are\nnecessarily aware of that fact for the future. It is undisputed in this case that Sony had reason\nto know the Betamax would be used by some owners to tape copyrighted works off the air.\nSee 480 F.Supp., at 459-460.\nThe District Court also concluded that Sony had not caused, induced, or contributed\nmaterially to any infringing activities of Betamax owners. Id., at 460. In a case of this kind,\nhowever, causation can be shown indirectly; it does not depend on evidence that particular\nBetamax owners relied on particular advertisements. In an analogous case decided just two\nTerms ago, this Court approved a lower court's conclusion that liability for contributory\ntrademark infringement could be imposed on a manufacturer who \"suggested, even by\nimplication\" that a retailer use the manufacturer's goods to infringe the trademark of another.\nInwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 851 (1982); see id., at 860\n(opinion concurring in result). I think this standard is equally appropriate in the copyright\ncontext.\nThe District Court found that Sony has advertised the Betamax as suitable for off-the-air\nrecording of \"favorite shows,\" \"novels for television,\" and \"classic movies,\" 480 F.Supp., at\n436, with no visible warning that such recording could constitute copyright infringement. It is\nonly with the aid of the Betamax or some other VTR, that it is possible today for home\ntelevision viewers to infringe copyright by recording off-the-air. Off-the-air recording is not\nonly a foreseeable use for the Betamax, but indeed is its intended use. Under the\ncircumstances, I agree with the Court of Appeals that if off-the-air recording is an infringement\nof copyright, Sony has induced and materially contributed to the infringing conduct of Betamax\nowners. n40\nn40 My conclusion respecting contributory infringement does not include the retailer\ndefendants. The District Court found that one of the retailer defendants had assisted in\nthe advertising campaign for the Betamax, but made no other findings respecting their\nknowledge of the Betamax's intended uses. I do not agree with the Court of Appeals, at\nleast on this record, that the retailers \"are sufficiently engaged in the enterprise to be\nheld accountable,\" 659 F.2d 963, 976 (1981). In contrast, the advertising agency\nemployed to promote the Betamax was far more actively engaged in the advertising\ncampaign, and petitioners have not argued that the agency's liability differs in any way\nfrom that of Sony Corporation and Sony Corporation of America.\nB\nSony argues that the manufacturer or seller of a product used to infringe is absolved from\nliability whenever the product can be put to any substantial noninfringing use. Brief for\nPetitioners 41-42. The District Court so held, borrowing the \"staple article of commerce\"\ndoctrine governing liability for contributory infringement of patents. See 35 U. S. C. ß 271.\nn41 This Court today is much less positive. See ante, at 440-442. I do not agree that this\ntechnical judge-made doctrine of patent law, based in part on considerations irrelevant to the\nfield of copyright, see generally Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U.S. 176, 187\n199 (1980), should be imported wholesale into copyright law. Despite their common\nconstitutional source, see U.S. Const., Art. I, ß 8, cl. 8, patent and copyright protections have\nnot developed in a parallel fashion, and this Court in copyright cases in the past has borrowed\npatent concepts only sparingly. See Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S. 339, 345-346\n(1908).\n\nn41 The \"staple article of commerce\" doctrine protects those who manufacture\nproducts incorporated into or used with patented inventions -- for example, the paper\nand ink used with patented printing machines, Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U.S. 1\n(1912), or the dry ice used with patented refrigeration systems, Carbice Corp. v.\nAmerican Patents Corp., 283 U.S. 27 (1931). Because a patent holder has the right to\ncontrol the use of the patented item as well as its manufacture, see Motion Picture\nPatents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 509-510 (1917); 35 U. S. C. ß\n271(a), such protection for the manufacturer of the incorporated product is necessary to\nprevent patent holders from extending their monopolies by suppressing competition in\nunpatented components and supplies suitable for use with the patented item. See\nDawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U.S. 176, 197-198 (1980). The doctrine\nof contributory patent infringement has been the subject of attention by the courts and\nby Congress, see id., at 202-212, and has been codified since 1952, 66 Stat. 792, but\nwas never mentioned during the copyright law revision process as having any relevance\nto contributory copyright infringement.\nI recognize, however, that many of the concerns underlying the \"staple article of\ncommerce\" doctrine are present in copyright law as well. As the District Court noted, if liability\nfor contributory infringement were imposed on the manufacturer or seller of every product\nused to infringe -- a typewriter, a camera, a photocopying machine -- the \"wheels of\ncommerce\" would be blocked. 480 F.Supp., at 461; see also Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,\n222 U.S., at 62.\nI therefore conclude that if a significant portion of the product's use is noninfringing, the\nmanufacturers and sellers cannot be held contributorily liable for the product's infringing uses.\nSee ante, at 440-441. If virtually all of the product's use, however, is to infringe, contributory\nliability may be imposed; if no one would buy the product for noninfringing purposes alone, it\nis clear that the manufacturer is purposely profiting from the infringement, and that liability is\nappropriately imposed. In such a case, the copyright owner's monopoly would not be\nextended beyond its proper bounds; the manufacturer of such a product contributes to the\ninfringing activities of others and profits directly thereby, while providing no benefit to the\npublic sufficient to justify the infringement.\nThe Court of Appeals concluded that Sony should be held liable for contributory\ninfringement, reasoning that \"[videotape] recorders are manufactured, advertised, and sold for\nthe primary purpose of reproducing television programming,\" and \"[virtually] all television\nprogramming is copyrighted material.\" 659 F.2d, at 975. While I agree with the first of these\npropositions, n42 the second, for me, is problematic. The key question is not the amount of\ntelevision programming that is copyrighted, but rather the amount of VTR usage that is\ninfringing. n43 Moreover, the parties and their amici have argued vigorously about both the\namount of television programming that is covered by copyright and the amount for which\npermission to copy has been given. The proportion of VTR recording that is infringing is\nultimately a question of fact, n44 and the District Court specifically declined to make findings\non the \"percentage of legal versus illegal home-use recording.\" 480 F.Supp., at 468. In light of\nmy view of the law, resolution of this factual question is essential. I therefore would remand\nthe case for further consideration of this by the District Court.\nn42 Although VTR's also may be used to watch prerecorded video cassettes and to\nmake home motion pictures, these uses do not require a tuner such as the Betamax\ncontains. See n. 1, supra. The Studios do not object to Sony's sale of VTR's without\ntuners. Brief for Respondents 5, n. 9. In considering the noninfringing uses of the\n\nVI\nBetamax, therefore, those uses that would remain possible without the Betamax's built-\nin tuner should not be taken into account.\nn43 Noninfringing uses would include, for example, recording works that are not\nprotected by copyright, recording works that have entered the public domain, recording\nwith permission of the copyright owner, and, of course, any recording that qualifies as\nfair use. See, e. g., Bruzzone v. Miller Brewing Co., 202 USPQ 809 (ND Cal. 1979) (use\nof home VTR for market research studies).\nn44 Sony asserts that much or most television broadcasting is available for home\nrecording because (1) no copyright owner other than the Studios has brought an\ninfringement action, and (2) much televised material is ineligible for copyright protection\nbecause videotapes of the broadcasts are not kept. The first of these assertions is\nirrelevant; Sony's liability does not turn on the fact that only two copyright owners thus\nfar have brought suit. The amount of infringing use must be determined through\nconsideration of the television market as a whole. Sony's second assertion is based on a\nfaulty premise; the Copyright Office permits audiovisual works transmitted by television\nto be registered by deposit of sample frames plus a description of the work. See 37 CFR\nß ß 202.20(c)(2)(ii) and 202.21(g) (1983). Moreover, although an infringement action\ncannot be brought unless the work is registered, 17 U. S. C. ß 411(a) (1982 ed.),\nregistration is not a condition of copyright protection. ß 408(a). Copying an\nunregistered work still may be infringement. Cf. ß 506(a) (liability for criminal copyright\ninfringement; not conditioned on prior registration).\nThe Court has adopted an approach very different from the one I have outlined. It is my\nview that the Court's approach alters dramatically the doctrines of fair use and contributory\ninfringement as they have been developed by Congress and the courts. Should Congress\nchoose to respond to the Court's decision, the old doctrines can be resurrected. As it stands,\nhowever, the decision today erodes much of the coherence that these doctrines have struggled\nto achieve.\nThe Court's disposition of the case turns on its conclusion that time-shifting is a fair use.\nBecause both parties agree that time-shifting is the primary use of VTR's, that conclusion, if\ncorrect, would settle the issue of Sony's liability under almost any definition of contributory\ninfringement. The Court concludes that time-shifting is fair use for two reasons. Each is\nseriously flawed.\nThe Court's first reason for concluding that time-shifting is fair use is its claim that many\ncopyright holders have no objection to time-shifting, and that \"respondents have no right to\nprevent other copyright holders from authorizing it for their programs.\" Ante, at 442. The\nCourt explains that a finding of contributory infringement would \"inevitably frustrate the\ninterests of broadcasters in reaching the portion of their audience that is available only through\ntime-shifting.\" Ante, at 446. Such reasoning, however, simply confuses the question of liability\nwith the difficulty of fashioning an appropriate remedy. It may be that an injunction\nprohibiting the sale of VTR's would harm the interests of copyright holders who have no\nobjection to others making copies of their programs. But such concerns should and would be\ntaken into account in fashioning an appropriate remedy once liability has been found.\nRemedies may well be available that would not interfere with authorized time-shifting at all.\nThe Court of Appeals mentioned the possibility of a royalty payment that would allow VTR sales\nand time-shifting to continue unabated, and the parties may be able to devise other narrowly\ntailored remedies. Sony may be able, for example, to build a VTR that enables broadcasters to\nscramble the signal of individual programs and \"jam\" the unauthorized recording of them.\n\nEven were an appropriate remedy not available at this time, the Court should not misconstrue\ncopyright holders' rights in a manner that prevents enforcement of them when, through\ndevelopment of better techniques, an appropriate remedy becomes available. n45\nn45 Even if concern with remedy were appropriate at the liability stage, the Court's\nuse of the District Court's findings is somewhat cavalier. The Court relies heavily on\ntestimony by representatives of professional sports leagues to the effect that they have\nno objection to VTR recording. The Court never states, however, whether the sports\nleagues are copyright holders, and if so, whether they have exclusive copyrights to\nsports broadcasts. It is therefore unclear whether the sports leagues have authority to\nconsent to copying the broadcasts of their events.\nAssuming that the various sports leagues do have exclusive copyrights in some of\ntheir broadcasts, the amount of authorized time-shifting still would not be overwhelming.\nSony's own survey indicated that only 7.3% of all Betamax use is to record sports events\nof all kinds. Tr. 2353, Defendants' Exh. OT, Table 20. Because Sony's witnesses did not\nrepresent all forms of sports events, moreover, this figure provides only a tenuous basis\nfor this Court to engage in factfinding of its own.\nThe only witness at trial who was clearly an exclusive copyright owner and who\nexpressed no objection to unauthorized time-shifting was the owner of the copyright in\nMister Rogers' Neighborhood. But the Court cites no evidence in the record to the effect\nthat anyone makes VTR copies of that program. The simple fact is that the District Court\nmade no findings on the amount of authorized time-shifting that takes place. The Court\nseems to recognize this gap in its reasoning, and phrases its argument as a hypothetical.\nThe Court states: \"If there are millions of owners of VTR's who make copies of televised\nsports events, religious broadcasts, and educational programs such as Mister Rogers'\nNeighborhood, and if the proprietors of those programs welcome the practice,\" the sale\nof VTR's \"should not be stifled\" in order to protect respondents' copyrights. Ante, at 446\n(emphasis supplied). Given that the Court seems to recognize that its argument\ndepends on findings that have not been made, it seems that a remand is inescapable.\nThe Court's second stated reason for finding that Sony is not liable for contributory\ninfringement is its conclusion that even unauthorized time-shifting is fair use. Ante, at 447 et\nseq. This conclusion is even more troubling. The Court begins by suggesting that the fair use\ndoctrine operates as a general \"equitable rule of reason.\" That interpretation mischaracterizes\nthe doctrine, and simply ignores the language of the statute. Section 107 establishes the fair\nuse doctrine \"for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, . . .\nscholarship, or research.\" These are all productive uses. It is true that the legislative history\nstates repeatedly that the doctrine must be applied flexibly on a case-by-case basis, but those\nreferences were only in the context of productive uses. Such a limitation on fair use comports\nwith its purpose, which is to facilitate the creation of new works. There is no indication that\nthe fair use doctrine has any application for purely personal consumption on the scale involved\nin this case, n46 and the Court's application of it here deprives fair use of the major cohesive\nforce that has guided evolution of the doctrine in the past.\nn46 As has been explained, some uses of time-shifting, such as copying an old\nnewspaper clipping for a friend, are fair use because of their de minimis effect on the\ncopyright holder. The scale of copying involved in this case, of course, is of an entirely\ndifferent magnitude, precluding application of such an exception.\n\nHaving bypassed the initial hurdle for establishing that a use is fair, the Court then\npurports to apply to time-shifting the four factors explicitly stated in the statute. The first is\n\"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or\nis for nonprofit educational purposes.\" ß 107(1). The Court confidently describes time-shifting\nas a noncommercial, nonprofit activity. It is clear, however, that personal use of programs\nthat have been copied without permission is not what ß 107(1) protects. The intent of the\nsection is to encourage users to engage in activities the primary benefit of which accrues to\nothers. Time-shifting involves no such humanitarian impulse. It is likewise something of a\nmischaracterization of time-shifting to describe it as noncommercial in the sense that that term\nis used in the statute. As one commentator has observed, time-shifting is noncommercial in\nthe same sense that stealing jewelry and wearing it -- instead of reselling it -- is\nnoncommercial. n47 Purely consumptive uses are certainly not what the fair use doctrine was\ndesigned to protect, and the awkwardness of applying the statutory language to time-shifting\nonly makes clearer that fair use was designed to protect only uses that are productive.\nn47 Home Recording of Copyrighted Works: Hearing before the Subcommittee on\nCourts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 1250 (1982) (memorandum of Prof. Laurence\nH. Tribe).\nThe next two statutory factors are all but ignored by the Court -- though certainly not\nbecause they have no applicability. The second factor -- \"the nature of the copyrighted work\"\n-- strongly supports the view that time-shifting is an infringing use. The rationale guiding\napplication of this factor is that certain types of works, typically those involving \"more of\ndiligence than of originality or inventiveness,\" New York Times Co. v. Roxbury Data Interface,\nInc., 434 F.Supp. 217, 221 (NJ 1977), require less copyright protection than other original\nworks. Thus, for example, informational works, such as news reports, that readily lend\nthemselves to productive use by others, are less protected than creative works of\nentertainment. Sony's own surveys indicate that entertainment shows account for more than\n80% of the programs recorded by Betamax owners. n48\nn48 See A Survey of Betamax Owners, Tr. 2353, Defendants' Exh. OT, Table 20,\ncited in Brief for Respondents 52.\nThe third statutory factor -- \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used\" -- is even\nmore devastating to the Court's interpretation. It is undisputed that virtually all VTR owners\nrecord entire works, see 480 F.Supp., at 454, thereby creating an exact substitute for the\ncopyrighted original. Fair use is intended to allow individuals engaged in productive uses to\ncopy small portions of original works that will facilitate their own productive endeavors. Time-\nshifting bears no resemblance to such activity, and the complete duplication that it involves\nmight alone be sufficient to preclude a finding of fair use. It is little wonder that the Court has\nchosen to ignore this statutory factor. n49\nn49 The Court's one oblique acknowledgment of this third factor, ante, at 447, and n.\n30, seems to suggest that the fact that time-shifting involves copying complete works is\nnot very significant because the viewers already have been asked to watch the initial\nbroadcast free. This suggestion misses the point. As has been noted, a book borrowed\nfrom a public library may not be copied any more freely than one that has been\n\npurchased. An invitation to view a showing is completely different from an invitation to\ncopy a copyrighted work.\nThe fourth factor requires an evaluation of \"the effect of the use upon the potential market\nfor or value of the copyrighted work.\" This is the factor upon which the Court focuses, but once\nagain, the Court has misread the statute. As mentioned above, the statute requires a court to\nconsider the effect of the use on the potential market for the copyrighted work. The Court has\nstruggled mightily to show that VTR use has not reduced the value of the Studios' copyrighted\nworks in their present markets. Even if true, that showing only begins the proper inquiry. The\ndevelopment of the VTR has created a new market for the works produced by the Studios.\nThat market consists of those persons who desire to view television programs at times other\nthan when they are broadcast, and who therefore purchase VTR recorders to enable them to\ntime-shift. n50 Because time-shifting of the Studios' copyrighted works involves the copying of\nthem, however, the Studios are entitled to share in the benefits of that new market. Those\nbenefits currently go to Sony through Betamax sales. Respondents therefore can show harm\nfrom VTR use simply by showing that the value of their copyrights would increase if they were\ncompensated for the copies that are used in the new market. The existence of this effect is\nself-evident.\nn50 The Court implicitly has recognized that this market is very significant. The\ncentral concern underlying the Court's entire opinion is that there is a large audience\nwho would like very much to be able to view programs at times other than when they\nare broadcast. Ante, at 446. The Court simply misses the implication of its own\nconcerns.\nBecause of the Court's conclusion concerning the legality of time-shifting, it never\naddresses the amount of noninfringing use that a manufacturer must show to absolve itself\nfrom liability as a contributory infringer. Thus, it is difficult to discuss how the Court's test for\ncontributory infringement would operate in practice under a proper analysis of time-shifting.\nOne aspect of the test as it is formulated by the Court, however, particularly deserves\ncomment. The Court explains that a manufacturer of a product is not liable for contributory\ninfringement as long as the product is \"capable of substantial noninfringing uses.\" Ante, at 442\n(emphasis supplied). Such a definition essentially eviscerates the concept of contributory\ninfringement. Only the most unimaginative manufacturer would be unable to demonstrate that\na image-duplicating product is \"capable\" of substantial noninfringing uses. Surely Congress\ndesired to prevent the sale of products that are used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights;\nthe fact that noninfringing uses exist presumably would have little bearing on that desire.\nMore importantly, the rationale for the Court's narrow standard of contributory\ninfringement reveals that, once again, the Court has confused the issue of liability with that of\nremedy. The Court finds that a narrow definition of contributory infringement is necessary in\norder to protect \"the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of\ncommerce.\" Ante, at 442. But application of the contributory infringement doctrine implicates\nsuch rights only if the remedy attendant upon a finding of liability were an injunction against\nthe manufacture of the product in question. The issue of an appropriate remedy is not before\nthe Court at this time, but it seems likely that a broad injunction is not the remedy that would\nbe ordered. It is unfortunate that the Court has allowed its concern over a remedy to infect its\nanalysis of liability.\nVII\n\nThe Court of Appeals, having found Sony liable, remanded for the District Court to consider\nthe propriety of injunctive or other relief. Because of my conclusion as to the issue of liability,\nI, too, would not decide here what remedy would be appropriate if liability were found. I\nconcur, however, in the Court of Appeals' suggestion that an award of damages, or continuing\nroyalties, or even some form of limited injunction, may well be an appropriate means of\nbalancing the equities in this case. n51 Although I express no view on the merits of any\nparticular proposal, I am certain that, if Sony were found liable in this case, the District Court\nwould be able to fashion appropriate relief. The District Court might conclude, of course, that\na continuing royalty or other equitable relief is not feasible. The Studios then would be\nrelegated to statutory damages for proven instances of infringement. But the difficulty of\nfashioning relief, and the possibility that complete relief may be unavailable, should not affect\nour interpretation of the statute.\nn51 Other nations have imposed royalties on the manufacturers of products used to\ninfringe copyright. See, e. g., Copyright Laws and Treaties of the World (UNESCO/BNA\n1982) (English translation), reprinting Federal Act on Copyright in Works of Literature\nand Art and on Related Rights (Austria), ß ß 42(5)-(7), and An Act dealing with\nCopyright and Related Rights (Federal Republic of Germany), Art. 53(5). A study\nproduced for the Commission of European Communities has recommended that these\nrequirements \"serve as a pattern\" for the European community. A. Dietz, Copyright Law\nin the European Community 135 (1978). While these royalty systems ordinarily depend\non the existence of authors' collecting societies, see id., at 119, 136, such collecting\nsocieties are a familiar part of our copyright law. See generally Broadcast Music, Inc. v.\nColumbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 4-5 (1979). Fashioning relief of this\nsort, of course, might require bringing other copyright owners into court through\ncertification of a class or otherwise.\nLike so many other problems created by the interaction of copyright law with a new\ntechnology, \"[there] can be no really satisfactory solution to the problem presented here, until\nCongress acts.\" Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S., at 167 (dissenting opinion).\nBut in the absence of a congressional solution, courts cannot avoid difficult problems by\nrefusing to apply the law. We must \"take the Copyright Act . . . as we find it,\" Fortnightly\nCorp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U.S., at 401-402, and \"do as little damage as\npossible to traditional copyright principles . . . until the Congress legislates.\" Id., at 404\n(dissenting opinion)."
