While many CML patients treated with Gleevec experience remission, a significant population develops resistance to the drug. Point mutations in the gene that encodes the Bcr-Abl protein have been identified in patients with Gleevec-resistant CML.\n\nIn this course, students express a Gleevec-resistant mutant of the Bcr-Abl kinase domain and investigate in-vitro inhibition of kinase activity by Gleevec and a second kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib. The mutant Abl domain is expressed in\nE. coli\nand then purified and analyzed using nickel affinity chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and BSA quantification. Students use a coupled phosphorylation assay to determine the specific activity of their expressed mutant kinase domain and the wild type kinase domain in the absense and presence of Gleevec and Dasatinib. Students use a structure-viewing program to explore the mechanistic basis of Bcr-Abl inhibition and Gleevec-resistance.\n\nStudents also use site-directed mutagenesis to create the DNA for another Gleevec-reistance mutant of their choice.\n\nPre-Labs and Lab Participation\n\nPrior to each laboratory session (except for session 1), you should outline the procedures you will be carrying out and complete any relevant calculations. Prelabs should include a clear outline, but need not repeat detailed procedures that you will refer to in your lab manual (for example, the step by step procedure for a miniprep). Your TA will assign you a grade of 0, 1 or 2 points for each lab session based on your preparation and participation in lab for that day.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPOINTS\n\nLab preparation and participation\n\n40 points\n\nLecture attendance\n\n10 points\n\nLaboratory work / lab report\n\n50 points\n\nTotal\n\n100 points\n\nCalendar\n\nThe calendar below provides information on the course's lecture (Lec) and lab (Lab) sessions.\n\nSES #\n\nH396P ABL PROTEIN EXPRESSION/ KINASE INHIBITION ASSAYS\n\nDNA SITE-DIRECtED MUTAGENESIS\n\nLec 1\n\nIntroduction.

To\nprepare 5 mL of a 1 mg/mL aqueous solution of BSA, weigh out 5 mg of BSA into a 15-\nmL conical tube, add 5 mL of water, and invert or vortex the tube to completely dissolve\nthe BSA. BSA aliquots may be stored long term at -20 °C. Prior to each assay, prepare\nfive dilutions of the BSA stock solution to create a standard curve. The linear range of the\nBio-Rad protein assay is 0.2 to 0.9 mg/mL. Therefore in six separate 0.65-mL eppendorf\ntubes, label and add the following: 270 μL of the BSA stock and 30 μL of deionized\nwater (to give 0.9 mg/mL), 210 μL of BSA and 90 μL of water (to give 0.7 mg/mL), 165\nμL of BSA and 135 μL of water (to give 0.55 mg/mL), 120 μL of BSA and 180 μL of\nwater (to give 0.4 mg.mL), 60 μL of BSA and 240 μL of water (to give 0.2 mg/mL), and\nno BSA and 300 uL of water (to use as your \"blank\").\n\nPrepare 20 mL of the assay dye reagent by diluting one part Bio-Rad dye\nconcentrate with four parts DI water. Filter the resulting solution and store any unused\nreagent for up to two weeks at room temperature. To create a standard curve using the\nBSA standards, pipette 20 μL of each standard into an eppendorf tube. Add 980 μL of the\nprepared dye reagent to each tube and vortex briefly. Incubate the tubes at room\ntemperature for 5 to 50 minutes. Measure the absorbance of each solution at 595 nm by\nUV/Vis spectrometry using disposable polystyrene cuvettes. The sample with 20 μL of\nwater in 980 μL of assay reagent should be used as your \"blank\" in the\nspectrophotometer. Plot the absorbance vs. concentration for the BSA standards using\nMicrosoft Excel or another graphing program and determine the R-squared value and\nslope of the best-fit line to establish that you can obtain a strait line with your standards.\nIf your R-squared value is less than 0.9, repeat the exercise until you achieve an\nacceptable line. Good laboratory practice calls for the creation of a new standard curve\neach time you run a protein assay.\n\nTo determine the concentration of unknown samples, combine 20 uL of your\nsample (or an appropriate dilution) with 980 μL of assay reagent and measure the\nabsorbance at 595. Use the slope of the standard curve to calculate the sample\nconcentration in mg/mL.\n\nA2: Varian Cary 100 Spectrophotometer Instructions\n\n1. Turn on the spectrophotometer.\n2. Open the \"simple reads\" program, found as a desktop icon or under the Cary\nWinUV menu under the \"Start\" button.\n3. The lamps are on if under the \"Commands\" menu \"Lamps Off\" is displayed. If\n\"Lamps On\" is displayed, click on it to turn on the lamps. For accurate\nmeasurements, allow the lamp to warm up for at least 15 minutes before use.\n4. To set the instrument, click the \"Setup...\" command button on the left side of the\nscreen. In the \"Read the wavelength\" scroll box, type in the desired wavelength.\n\nThe \"Abs\" button in \"Y mode\" should be selected. When the setup is complete,\nclick the \"OK\" button to exit the window.\n5. Prior to measuring the absorbance of your samples, you must zero the instrument.\nTo do this, open the lid and determine which cell is in the light path. Insert a\ncuvette with your blanking solution in the instrument. Close the lid completely,\nand press the \"Zero\" command button on the left side of the screen to zero the\ninstrument at the chosen wavelength. The blank should now have a absorbance\nread of zero give or take the small amount of \"noise\" present at all times.\n6. You are now ready to measure the absorbance of your samples. Insert a cuvette\ncontaining a sample into the instrument, close the lid completely, and press the\n\"Read\" button at the top of the screen. Record the absorbance measurement.\n7. Under the \"File\" menu, select \"Print\" to print your data.\n8. When finished, close the program and return to the desktop.\n9. Turn off the lamps, then turn off the instrument.\n\nA3: DNA isolation from a bacterial pellet (miniprep)\nhttp://www1.qiagen.com/literature/handbooks/PDF/PlasmidDNAPurification/PLS_QP_\nMiniprep/1043788_HB_QIAprep_122006.pdf\n\nMiniprep Procedure:\na.) Harvest the bacterial cells from your 3-mL overnight culture by transferring 1.5 mL\ninto a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and spinning down the cells in a microcentrifuge for 3\nminutes. Discard the supernatant and add the remaining 1.5 mL of cell culture to the tube.\nRepeat the centrifugation and discard the supernatant. You should have a small bacterial\npellet at the bottom of the tube.\nb.) Check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. Add 250 μL of Buffer P1 to the cell\npellet and completely resuspend the pellet by vortexing.\nc.) Add 250 μL of Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Do not vortex,\nsince that can cause shearing of the DNA. If you have properly lysed the cells, the cell\nsuspension will turn blue after the addition of the P2 buffer. If there are colorless regions\nor brown clumps in the cells, continue mixing until a homogenous blue solution appears.\nd.) Add 350 μL of Buffer N3 and mix immediately by inverting the tube 4-6 times. The\nsolution should become colorless and cloudy.\ne.) Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in you bench top microcentrifuge. A\ncompact white pellet should form.\nf.) Apply the resulting supernatant (which contains the plasmid DNA) to a QIAprep spin\ncolumn by decanting or pipetting.\ng.) Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow through.\nh.) Wash the spin column by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 s.\nDiscard the flow through.\ni.) Centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. This is essential for\nthe success of any future enzymatic reactions.\nj.) Place the QIAprep spin column into a clean and labeled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTo elute DNA, add 50 μL of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.5) to the center of the spin\ncolumn, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.\n\nFor long term storage, keep purified DNA at -20 °C.\n\nA4: Quantification of DNA concentration\nDissolve x μL (typically, 1-3 μL) of DNA sample in 100 μL of water. Measure the\nabsorbance at 260 nm in a quartz cuvette. See Section Appendix A2 for UV/Vis\nspectrophotometer instructions. To calculate the concentration in μg/μL of your double\nstranded (ds) DNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.05)(100/x). Typical concentrations of\nminiprepped DNA are 0.1-2 μg/μL. To calculate the concentration of single stranded (ss)\nDNA or RNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.04)(100/x) instead.\nTo convert the concentration to mol/L, use the fact that 1 base pair has a molecular\nweight of ~650 g/mol, so a 5 kb plasmid has a typical molecular weight of 3.3x106 g/mol.\nFor ssDNA or RNA, use a molecular weight of 325 g/mol per nucleotide.\n\nAPPENDIX B: Protein and Nucleotide Sequences\n\nB1: Protein Sequence of c-Abl(229-511) (283 AA; 32,730 MW) from ABL1_HUMAN\nSwissprot accession number: P00519 (http://www.expasy.org/uniprot/P00519).\nNumbering is for isoform 1A. For isoform 1B numbering, add 19 (Abl(248-530)). We\nwill use 1A numbering throughout this course.\n(229)SP NYDKWEMERT\n\n250 260 270 280 290 300\nDITMKHKLGG GQYGEVYEGV WKKYSLTVAV KTLKEDTMEV EEFLKEAAVM KEIKHPNLVQ\n\n310 320 330 340 350 360\nLLGVCTREPP FYIITEFMTY GNLLDYLREC NRQEVNAVVL LYMATQISSA MEYLEKKNFI\n\n370 380 390 400 410 420\nHRDLAARNCL VGENHLVKVA DFGLSRLMTG DTYTAHAGAK FPIKWTAPES LAYNKFSIKS\n\n430 440 450 460 470 480\nDVWAFGVLLW EIATYGMSPY PGIDLSQVYE LLEKDYRMER PEGCPEKVYE LMRACWQWNP\n\n490 500 510\nSDRPSFAEIH QAFETMFQES SISDEVEKEL G\n\nB2: Nucleotide sequence encoding Abl(229-511)\nThe nucleotide sequence of the Abl(229-511) construct that we are working with is\nidentical to the kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl protein.

This\nmeans that the kinase activity of c-Abl is tightly regulated, and the default activity setting\nis \"off\".\n\nA chromosomal abnormality related to chronic myleloid leukemia (CML) causes\nthe reciprocal translocation of genetic material from two different chromosomes, 9 and\n22, which results in the formation of a mutant gene that contains part of the BCR (break\ncluster region) gene from chromosome 22 and part of the ABL gene from chromosome 9.\nThis mutant gene is called BCR-ABL, and the protein it encodes, denoted Bcr-Abl,\ncontains the kinase domain of c-Abl, but lacks the residues responsible for auto-\ninhibition. Bcr-Abl is therefore a constitutively active kinase, which means that the\nactivity is permanently \"on\". This aberrant kinase activity is responsible for uncontrolled\ncell proliferation, which leads to cancer.\n\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nSH3\nSH2\ncap\nC-terminal\ndomains\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nSH3\nSH2\nC-terminal\ndomains\nBCR\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nc-Abl kinase (or Abl)\nThe activity of c-Abl is auto-inhibited by its\nN-terminal domains.

We will use it\nas a mimic of Bcr-Abl for our investigations. Like\nBcr-Abl, it is constitutively active.\nBCR\nAbl\nWe will abbreviate this below as\n\nA Small Molecule Drug for CML Treatment\n\nBcr-Abl activity is the underlying cause for CML, and the identification of the\nBcr-Abl oncoprotein led to high throughput screening and the \"rational design\" of\npotential small molecule inhibitors. These efforts culminated in the development of the\ndrug Gleevec by chemists at the pharmaceutical company Novartis (a branch of which is\na few doors down from us on Mass Ave). Gleevec (also known as Glivec, imatinib, and\nSTI-571) showed excellent efficacy against CML and was approved by the FDA in 2001.\nThis development was particularly thrilling to the scientific community because Gleevec\nis the first example of a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat human disease.\nGleevec inhibits Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity by competitively binding the ATP-\nbinding site of the kinase domain and stabilizing the inactive conformation of the protein.\nAlso exciting is the striking specificity of Gleevec for Abl. Gleevec only inhibits two\nother proteins at physiological levels, neither of which result in problematic side effects.\n\nBcr\nAbl\nuncontrolled cell proliferation\n(cancer)\nACTIVE kinase\nBcr\nAbl\nACTIVE kinase\nBcr\nAbl\nINACTIVE kinase\nGleevec\nGleevec\nunc\n\nHowever....A PERCENTAGE OF CML PATIENTS DO NOT RESPOND TO\nGLEEVEC TREATMENT, AND OTHER PATIENTS THAT INITIALLY RESPOND\nTO TREATMENT EVENTUALLY DEVELOP GLEEVEC RESISTANCE.\nontrolled\nliferationX\ncell\npro\n(cancer)\n\nThe majority of these Gleevec-resistant cases can be linked to a single amino acid\nmutation in the Abl kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl protein.

The Abl kinase domain, similar to Bcr-\nAbl, lacks the N-terminal Abl regulation domains and is thus constitutively active.\nDuring this course you will express and purify an H396P mutant of the Abl kinase\ndomain, a mutation that has been identified in patients with Gleevec-resistent CML. You\nwill use this mutant along with (commercially available) wild-type Abl kinase domain in\na coupled phosphorylation assay to determine kinase activity in the absence and presence\nof Gleevec and other kinase inhibitors. In addition, you will use site-directed mutagenesis\nto create a DNA expression vector for future expression of an Abl mutant of your choice.\nconstitutively active\nGleevec\nGleevec\nwild type\nInactive\nActive or Inactive?\nActive or Inactive?\nActive or Inactive?\nXXX\nXXX\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nconstitutively active\nwild type\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nconstitutively active\nAbl kinase\ndomain\n*H396P mutant\nconstitutively active\nAbl kinase\ndomain\n*H396P mutant\nBcr\nbl\nACTIVE kinase\nA\n*\nGleevec\nuncontrolled cell\nproliferation\n(cancer)\nBcr\nl\nACTIVE kinase\nAb\n*\nmutant\nGleevec\n\nModule 4 and 5 Overview: Gleevec is a blockbuster small molecule drug for chronic\nmyelogenous leukemia (CML) that functions as a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, an aberrant\nkinase implicated in the disease. While over 80% of patients treated with Gleevec in the\nchronic stage of CML experience remission, a significant population eventually develops\nresistance to the drug. A number of point mutations in the gene that encodes the Bcr-Abl\nprotein have been identified in patients with Gleevec-resistant CML. Over the semester\nyou will develop and execute a research plan to 1) determine whether a selected mutation\n(H396P) in the BCR-ABL gene confers Gleevec resistance using an in-vitro kinase assay,\n2) explore the efficacy of alternative Bcr-Abl inhibitors on the wild-type and mutant\nkinases, 3) evaluate crystal structures to understand the mechanism(s) by which Bcr-Abl\nmutations block drug activity, and 4) use site-directed mutagenesis to create an Abl\nmutant of your choice.

You\nwill also isolate wild type (wt) Abl plasmid DNA for subsequent mutagenesis.\n\n1) Preparation of LB media (the details in grey may be prepared by your TA)\nLB (Luria-Bertani) media must be prepared and sterilized for use in the bacterial growth\nand protein expression you will carry out in the next few sessions. The media should\ncontain a final concentration of 1% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract and 1.0% NaCl in\nwater. Using the premixed powder, add 25 g of LB powder/ L of water to achieve the\ndesired concentrations. Prepare a 500-mL solution of LB in a 1-L flask and a separate\n100-mL solution in a 200-mL container. For sterilization, cover the containers with\naluminum foil and make sure the cap is not screwed onto the 200-mL container. Stick a\npiece of autoclave indicator tape on the side of each flask. The tape will turn color upon\nreaching a sufficient sterilization temperature. Follow the TA's instructions for using the\nautoclave. Media is typically autoclaved for 20 min. Once the sterilized LB media has\ncooled enough for you to hold the flask comfortably, use sterile technique to add\nkanamycin (kan) and streptomycin (strep) (antibiotics) to a final concentration of 50\nμg/mL each to the 500-mL solution. The TA's will provide you with a 50 mg/ mL stock\nof strep and a 50 mg/ mL stock of kan, so you should add 500 μL of strep and 500 μL of\nkan to the 500 mL of LB. Do not add antibiotics to the 200-mL bottle, and screw the cap\non tightly once the solution has cooled completely.\n\nUsing sterile technique demonstrated by your TA, transfer two 6-mL and one 5-mL\naliquots of LB from the 200-mL bottle into three cell culture tubes. Tomorrow you will\ncheck to confirm that your tubes have remained clear, indicating that you have used good\nsterile technique. If your media becomes cloudy (other than after intentional inoculation),\nit means the solution has been contaminated, and you must prepare fresh media.\n\nSESSION 1B\n1) Inoculation of LB/ kan with E. coli containing a plasmid encoding the wt Abl kinase\ndomain\n\nConfirm that your LB media is contamination-free by checking that the solutions are\nclear. Add 6 μL of the kan 50 mg/mL stock solution to each of the culture tubes\ncontaining 6 mL of LB to give a final concentration of 50 μg/mL kan. Using a sterile\npipette tip, transfer half of a colony from a freshly-transformed bacterial plate (supplied\nby your TA) to a culture tube. You should drop the entire pipette tip into the solution.\nWith a second pipette tip, transfer the other half of the colony to the second tube. The\ncolonies on the plate are DH5-α E. coli cells, which are ideal bacterial storage cells to\nhold a vector of interest (in this case an Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid). Place the\nculture tubes in a 37 °C shaker overnight. In session 2 you will isolate the Abl kinase\ndomain plasmid DNA from the bacteria that grows up overnight.\n\n2) Inoculation of LB/ kan/ strep with E. coli containing plasmids encoding the H396P\nAbl kinase domain and the Yop phosphatase\n\nAdd 5 μL of the 50 mg/mL kan stock solution and 5 μL of the 50 mg/mL strep stock\nsolution to the culture tube containing 5 mL of LB to give a final concentration of 50\nμg/mL of each antibiotic. Using a sterile pipet tip, transfer a colony of H396P Abl(229-\n511)/ Yop-containing bacteria from a plate (supplied by your TA) to the culture tube. The\ncolonies on the plate are called BL21-DE3 cells, which are a cell-line commonly used for\nprotein expression. Place the culture tube in a 37 °C shaker overnight. In session 2 you\nwill use this \"starter culture\" to inoculate your 500-mL LB solution to express the H396P\nAbl(229-511) and Yop proteins.\n\nSESSION 1B (lab open 1-2 pm) FOR THE MON/WED SECTION ONLY\nSince your samples need to be inoculated the day before Session 2, you should only do\nthe procedures in black today. Your TA will come in on Sunday to perform the\ninoculation (indicated in grey) so that your samples are ready for you on Monday.\n\n1) Inoculation of LB/ kan with E. coli containing a plasmid encoding the Abl kinase\ndomain\n\nConfirm that your LB media is contamination-free by checking that the solutions are\nclear. Add 6 μL of the kan 50 mg/mL stock solution to each of the culture tubes\ncontaining 6 mL of LB to give a final concentration of 50 μg/mL kan. Using a sterile\npipette tip, transfer half of a colony from a freshly-transformed bacterial plate (supplied\nby your TA) to a culture tube. You should drop the entire pipette tip into the solution.\nWith a second pipette tip, transfer the other half of the colony to the second tube. The\ncolonies on the plate are DH5-α E. coli cells, which are ideal bacterial storage cells to\nhold a vector of interest (in this case an Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid). Place the\nculture tubes in a 37 °C shaker overnight. In session 2 you will isolate the Abl kinase\ndomain plasmid DNA from the bacteria that grows up overnight.\n\n2) Inoculation of LB/ kan/ strep with E. coli containing plasmids encoding the H396P\nAbl kinase domain and the Yop phosphatase\n\nAdd 5 μL of the 50 mg/mL kan stock solution and 5 μL of the 50 mg/mL strep stock\nsolution to the culture tube containing 5 mL of LB to give a final concentration of 50\nμg/mL of each antibiotic. Using a sterile pipet tip, transfer a colony of H396P Abl(229-\n511)/ Yop-containing bacteria from a plate (supplied by your TA) to the culture tube. The\ncolonies on the plate are called BL21-DE3 cells, which are a cell-line commonly used for\nprotein expression. Place the culture tube in a 37 °C shaker overnight. In session 2 you\nwill use this \"starter culture\" to inoculate your 500-mL LB solution to express the H396P\nAbl(229-511) and Yop proteins.\n\nBoth culture tubes should be cloudy with bacteria when you remove them from the\nshaker after overnight incubation in Session 2.\n\nSESSION 2\n\n1.) Expression of the H396P Abl kinase domain in the presence of Yop phosphatase\n\nInoculate 500 mL of LB/ kan/ strep with your 5-mL starter culture of bacteria containing\nthe ABL and YOP genes. Place the flask in the 37 °C shaker and periodically check the\nOD600 (optical density or absorbance at 600 nm) using the UV/Vis spectrometer. Use\n(non-inoculated) LB as the sample blank. Review the spectrometer instructions in\nAppendix A2. Once the OD600 reaches 0.1, the density should double approximately\nevery 20 minutes, which should help you plan when next to check the OD. When the\nmedia reaches an OD600 of 0.8 to 1.0, remove the flask from the 37 °C shaker and place\nit in the 24 °C shaker. At this point, transfer 1 mL of the culture to a 1.5-mL eppendorf\ntube and spin it down for 3 minutes in a bench top microcentrifuge. Remove the\nsupernatant and store the pellet at -20 °C. This is your pre-induction sample for\nsubsequent gel analysis. After the cell culture has been shaking at 24 °C for at least 10\nminutes (or up to one hour), induce protein expression with the addition of IPTG. Add\n100 μL of 1M IPTG to give a final concentration of 0.2 mM IPTG. Let the culture grow\nat 24 °C overnight.\n\n2.) Isolation of the wt Abl plasmid DNA from the two 6-mL overnight cultures.\n\nWhile you monitor the OD of your H396P Abl(229-511)/ Yop expression, you should\nconcurrently work to isolate the plasmid DNA from your two 6-mL overnight bacterial\ncultures, which contain the wt Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid. You will use the isolated\nplasmid DNA in later lab sessions for DNA mutagenesis to create a Bcr-Abl mutant\nimplicated in Gleevec-resistant CML.\n\nToday you will use a Qiagen miniprep kit to isolate the plasmid DNA. The following\ninstructions are modified from the Qiagen miniprep handbook:\n\nMiniprep Procedure:\na.) Harvest the bacterial cells from your overnight cultures (12 mL total) by transferring\n1.5 mL of culture into each of four 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes and spinning down the cells\nin a microcentrifuge for 3 minutes. Discard the supernatant and add 1.5 mL of remaining\nculture to the four eppendorf tubes. Repeat the centrifugation and discard the supernatant.\nYou should have a small bacterial pellet at the bottom of each tube.\nb.) Check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. Add 250 μL of Buffer P1 to each\ncell pellet and completely resuspend each pellet by vortexing.\nc.) Add 250 μL of Buffer P2 to each tube, and mix by inverting the tubes 4-6 times. Do\nnot vortex, since that can cause shearing of the DNA. If you have properly lysed the cells,\nthe cell suspensions will turn blue after the addition of the P2 buffer. If there are colorless\nregions or brown clumps in the cells, continue mixing until a homogenous blue solution\nappears.\nd.) Add 350 μL of Buffer N3 to each tube and mix immediately by inverting the tubes 4-6\ntimes. The solutions should become colorless and cloudy.\n\ne.) Centrifuge the tubes for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in you bench top microcentrifuge. A\ncompact white pellet should form in each sample.\nf.) Apply the resulting supernatant from each tube (which contains the plasmid DNA) to\neach of four QIAprep spin columns by decanting or pipetting.\ng.) Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow through.\nh.) Wash the spin columns by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 s.\nDiscard the flow through.\ni.) Centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. This is essential for\nthe success of any future enzymatic reactions.\nj.) Place the QIAprep spin columns into clean and labeled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nTo elute DNA, add 40 μL of Buffer EB warmed to 55 °C (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.5) to the\ncenter of each spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.\n\nCombine the DNA elution samples (160 μL total) in an eppendorf tube. For long-term\nstorage, keep the purified DNA, labeled with your names and the date, at -20 °C.\n\n3.) Quantification of the DNA concentration by absorption at 260 nm\n\nDissolve x μL (suggested amount is 3 μL) of DNA sample in 100 μL of water. Measure\nthe absorbance at 260 nm in a quartz cuvette. See Section Appendix A2 for UV/Vis\nspectrophotometer instructions. To calculate the concentration in μg/μL of your double\nstranded DNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.05)(100/x). Typical concentrations of\nminiprepped DNA are 0.1-2 μg/μL.\n\nSESSION 2B\n\nPreparation and storage of the H396P Abl(229-511)/Yop- containing cell pellet.\na.) Remove the 1-L culture flask from the shaker and transfer the contents into a 500-mL\ncentrifuge tube.\n\nb.) Prior to spinning down the culture, transfer 1 mL from the centrifuge tube into a 1.5-\nmL eppendorf tube and spin it down for 3 minutes in a bench-top microcentrifuge.\nRemove the supernatant and store the tiny pellet at -20 °C. This is your post-induction\nsample for subsequent gel analysis.\n\nc.) Balance the mass of your centrifuge tube with a blank or with another group's tube. If\nneeded, use a transfer pipette to adjust the amount of culture in each tube or to add buffer.\n\nd.) Spin down the cell culture in the centrifuge at 6K rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Make\nsure the centrifuge is balanced, and, when possible, combine your centrifuge run with that\nof other groups to minimize wait time.\n\ne.) As the culture is spinning down, tare a 50-mL conical tube and record the weight on\nthe tube and in your notebook.\n\nf.) Once the centrifuge run is complete, decant the supernatant and carefully remove any\nresidual liquid with a transfer pipette. To discard, treat the supernatant with 50% bleach,\nand then pour it down the drain with plenty of water. The protein is in the pellet.\n\ng.) Carefully scrape the pellets into the tared 50-mL conical tube using a spatula.\n\nh.) If needed (if the pellet is not transferring well from the 500 to the 50-mL tube), add\nsome buffer to transfer any remaining pellet stuck in the 500-mL tube. Spin down the\npellet in the 50-mL conical tube for 5 minutes using the centrifuge tube adaptors and\nmaking sure your sample is balanced with a blank. Discard the supernatant.\n\ni.) Weigh the tube and record the pellet weight.\n\nj.) Store the H396P Abl(229-511)/Yop-containing cell pellet in the -20 °C freezer until\nneeded for protein purification. Please make sure to write your names and the date on\nyour tube!\n\nSESSION 3\n\nDuring sessions 3 and 4 you will verify that the plasmid DNA you isolated contains a\nconstruct of the expected size for the Abl kinase domain. You will then design primers\nfor subsequent site-directed mutagenesis. In preparation for purifying the H396P Abl\nkinase domain, you will prepare all the necessary buffers for the lysis and purification. In\nsession 4, you will also prepare a standard curve for future protein quantification.\n\nRestriction enzymes (RE's) are enzymes that selectively cleave double stranded DNA\nbased on recognition of specific, short DNA sequences called recognition sites. In DNA\nengineering, restriction enzymes are used to cut open plasmids for the ligation of a\ncomplementarily-cut DNA insert into the plasmid for protein expression. In Session 2,\nyou isolated a DNA plasmid (the pET-28a vector) containing an insert encoding residues\n229-511 of the Abl kinase domain. Since the gene encoding the Abl kinase domain is\npositioned in the pET-28a vector between Xho1 and an Nde1 recognition sites, treatment\nof the plasmid with those two restriction enzymes should result in excision of the ABL\ninsert. Today you will excise the insert by digestion of the isolated plamid DNA with\nXho1 and Nde and check the size of the digestion products on an agarose gel to confirm\nthat your vector and insert are the expected size in base pairs (bp). As denoted in the\nvector map, the pET28a vector (minus the segment between the Nde1 and Xho1 sites) is\n5,289 bp, and the ABL insert should be 849 bp. As experimental controls, you will\nsimultaneously prepare a no-enzyme \"mock\" digest and digests containing only one of\nthe two restriction enzymes required to excise the ABL insert. By gel analysis of the four\nreactions, you will expect to see a band for the no-enzyme \"mock\" reaction at\napproximately 6,138 bp (consistent with the size of the insert plus vector. The one-\nenzyme reactions should linearize the plasmid DNA without excising any segment. Since\ncoiled plasmid DNA travels further by electrophoresis than equivalent linearized DNA,\nthese reactions should result in bands with an apparent size slightly larger than the uncut\nplasmid. A sample gel is provided below.\n\n2 3\nlane 1 500-bp DNA ladder\nlane 2 no-enzyme \"digestion\"\nlane 3 Xho1-only digestion\nlane 4 Nde1-only digestion\nlane 5 Xho1/Nde1 digestion\n500 bp\n1000 bp\n1500 bp\n2000 bp\n\n1.) DNA digestion with Xho1 and Nde1 restriction enzymes\n\nSet up analytical-scale digests of your plasmid DNA using 1 μg of DNA and final\nreaction volumes of 20 μL each. In each of four sterile 0.65 mL tubes, add the following\ncomponents in the order listed, where x = the volume of miniprep elution added (in μL)\nto give 1 μg of DNA:\n\nno enzyme\nXho1 only\nNde1 only\nXho1/Nde1\nSterile water\n\n17.8 - x μL\n17.3 - x μL\n17.3 - x μL\n16.8 - x μL\nRE 10X Buffer D\n\n2 μL\n\n2 μL\n\n2 μL\n\n2 μL\nBSA, 10 μg/ μL\n\n0.2 μL\n0.2 μL\n0.2 μL\n0.2 μL\nPlasmid DNA, 1 μg\n\nx μL\n\nx μL\n\nx μL\nx μL\nMix by pipetting, then add:\nXho1, 10 units/ μL\n\n0 μL\n\n0.5 μL\n0 μL\n\n0.5 μL\nNde1, 10 units/ μL\n\n0 μL\n\n0 μL\n\n0.5 μL\n0.5 μL\n\n______\n______\n______\n______\nFinal volume\n\n20 μL\n20 μL\n20 μL\n20 μL\n\nMix the reactions gently by pipetting, close the tubes, and centrifuge for several seconds\nin a bench-top microcentrifuge. Incubate the digestions for 1 hour in the 37 oC incubator.\nMeanwhile, prepare an agarose gel (described below) to analyze the digested DNA by\nelectrophoresis. When the digestions are complete, remove the tubes from the incubator\nand add 4 μL of 6X nucleic acid loading buffer to each of the reactions.\n\nDNA electrophoresis enables size-based DNA separation. Due to the negatively charged\nphosphate backbone of DNA, DNA molecules migrate from the negatively-charged to the\npositively-charged end of the gel. The smaller molecule travel faster than the larger\nmolecules. The size (in bp) of each separated DNA fragment is determined by\ncomparison to a DNA ladder that has a band at given intervals of bp. Here we will use a\n500 bp ladder that includes bands of DNA that are 500 bp, 1000 bp, 1500 bp, 2000 bp,\nand so on. Depending on the size of the DNA fragments you wish to analyze, more of\nless agarose can be incorporated into a DNA gel. The higher the percentage of agarose,\nthe smaller the effective range of separation will be. For analyzing the 849-bp insert and\nthe 6.1 kb Abl-containing vector, you will prepare a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel.\n\n2.) Preparation of a DNA 1.2 % agarose gel\n\nSet up the gel box as demonstrated by the TA. Insert the gel comb at the negatively-\ncharged (black) end of the box. In a 200-mL Erlenmeyer flask, weigh out 1.2 g agarose\nand add 100 mL of 1X Tris acetate electrophoresis (TAE) buffer. To prepare the 1X\nbuffer, dilute 10 mL of 10X TAE (provided by your TA) with 90 mL of DI water.\nDissolve the agarose by heating the flask in a microwave on medium heat until the\nsolution just boils. Prior to microwaving, plug the top of the flask with a paper towel to\nhelp prevent boiling over. All of the agarose solid should be dissolved and the solution\nshould be clear. Cool the solution to approximately 60 oC (cool enough to hold the flask\n\ncomfortably), and pour the solution into a prepared gel box. Allow the gel to set for\napproximately 30 minutes before loading. The colorless gel solution will have a bluish\ntint when the gel has solidified.\n\nOnce the gel has solidified, carefully remove the comb by pulling strait upwards.\nPour 1X TAE into the gel box so that it just covers the gel. Using a gel-loading tip that\nfits the 20-μL pipette, load 3 μL of 500-bp DNA ladder and 10 μL of each of your four\nDNA digestion samples. Remember, DNA will migrate toward the positive (red)\nelectrode. Loading the samples at the wrong end will cause the samples to run off the gel!\nPlace the top on the DNA gel box and run the gel at 100 Volts for 1 hour.\n\nOnce the gel running is complete, carefully remove the gel from the box and place\nit in a small plastic container, such as the top of a gel-tip box. Stain the gel with\napproximately 0.5 μg/ mL ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution for 10 minutes by agitating\non a gel rocker. EtBr is a fluorescent DNA intercalating agent, which means it inserts\nitself between DNA bases. Intercalated EtBr fluoresces under UV light with an intensity\nthat is approximately 20 fold brighter than EtBr that is not DNA-associated. This\nfluorescence increase results from the exclusion of water molecules (a common\nfluorescence quencher) associated with EtBr in solution. As an intercalating agent, it is\nnot surprising that EtBr is highly mutagenic and a suspected carcinogen and terratogen.\nWhile EtBr is less dangerous in solution than in the powder form, you should always\nwear nitrile gloves (not latex) and use extreme caution when handling any EtBr solution.\nAny gloves, paper towels, etc. that touch EtBr solutions should be discarded as solid EtBr\nhazardous waste.\n\nAfter incubation, dispose of the EtBr solution in the designated waste container.\nRinse the gel with water. Place the gel on the DNA transilluminator for visualization of\nyour bands, using appropriate UV shielding. Take a picture of your gel with the Polaroid\ncamera box for your lab report. Once you have a clear picture, discard the gel in the\ndesignated solid EtBr waste container.\n\nTo enable studies on additional point mutations found in the BCR-ABL gene of Gleevec-\nresistant cancer patients, you will introduce a point mutation in the wt DNA that you\nisolated and verified. Your resulting mutant DNA may be used in future iterations of the\ncourse for expression and use in kinase assays (as we are doing this year with the H396P\nmutant). Mutant DNA can be made from the wt DNA using site-directed mutagenesis.\nFrom the list of identified mutations in Appendix B3, select a mutant that interests you.\nWhile your DNA gel is running, you should begin designing primers to create the desired\nmutant DNA. Primer proposals should be written in the form of the proposal worksheet\nin Appendix C2 and turned in to your TA at the beginning of Session 4.\n\nOverview of DNA mutagenesis\n\nYou will use the QuikChange(r) (http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200518.pdf)\nsite-directed mutagenesis method to create your desired point mutation in the wt plasmid\nDNA that you have previously isolated by miniprep and analyzed by Xho1/Nde1\ndigestion. This mutagenesis method relies on a high-fidelity DNA polymerase and mutant\noligonucleotide primers, which you will design and that include the base pair substitution\nof interest. A DNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of\n\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n**\nGene in plasmid with\ntaget site for mutation\nDenature the plasmid and anneal\nthe oligonucleotide primers\ncontaining the desired mutation\nUsing the nonstrand-displacing\naction of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase,\nextend and incorporate the mutagenic\nprimers resulting in nicked circular strands\nDigest the methylated, nonmutated\nparental DNA template with Dpn I\nTransform the circular, nicked dsDNA\ninto DH5α chemically competent cells\nAfter transformation, the DH5α\ncells repair the nicks in the mutated\nplasmid\nStep 1\nPlasmid Preparation\nStep 2\nTemperature Cycling\nStep 3\nDigestion\nStep 4\nTransformation\nLEGEND\n*\n*\nmutagenic primer\nparental DNA plasmid\nmutated DNA plasmid\ntarget site for mutation\nmutagenic\nprimers\nmutated plamid\n(contains nicked\ncircular strands)\n\nFigure 1.

Specifically, the plasmid is denatured and the\nprimers containing the desired mutation are annealed to the complementary strand. The\npolymerase then uses the plasmid DNA as a template to extend the primers, resulting in a\nmutated plasmid with staggered nicks (breaks in the DNA where there are no connecting\nnucleotides against a strand of template DNA to make a new complimentary strand of\nDNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizes thermostable DNA polymerases,\nwhich enable the high temperature denaturation of DNA plamids to create single-\nstranded templates without simultaneously denaturing the polymerase enzyme. In the\nstandard mutagenesis procedure (Figure 1), the mutant primers are extended by the\nphosphodiester bond between nucleotides). In order to remove the wt template DNA\nfrom the PCR product mixture, the mixture is then treated with Dpn I endonuclease, an\nenzyme that specifically digests methylated and hemimethylated DNA. Since DNA\nisolated from most E. coli strands is methylated, treatment of the PCR product mixture\nwith Dpn 1 selectively digests the parent template DNA, leaving only mutant DNA\nassembled in vitro. The nicked vector DNA (containing the desired mutation) is then\ntransformed into DH5α cells. The cell machinery repairs the nicked DNA, and the\nrepaired mutant plasmid can be isolated by miniprep.\n\n3.) Design of forward and reverse mutant oligonucleotide primers\n\nYou will design two primers, each 25-45 nucleotides in length, which are the reverse\ncomplement (A to T and C to G) of each other and incorporate your desired mutation.\nThe following guidelines are from the Quikchange(r) instruction manual and should be\nadhered to exactly for successful mutagenesis.\n- The designed mutation should be in the middle of each primer with 10-15 bases of\ncorrect sequence on both sides.\n- Both mutagenic primers must contain the desired mutation and anneal to the same\nsequence on opposite strands of the plasmid.\n- Primers should be between 25 and 45 bases in length, with a melting temperature\n(Tm) greater than or equal to 78 oC. Use the formula below to estimate the Tm of\nyour proposed primers:\no Tm = 81.5 + 0.41(%GC) - 675/N - % mismatch\nwhere, N is the primer length in bases and the values for %GC and %\nmismatch are in whole numbers.\n- If possible, the primers should have a minimum GC content of 40% and should\nterminate in one or more C or G bases.\n- Primers must be purified by either fast polynucleotide liquid chromatography\n(FPLC) or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Failure to purify the\nprimers results in a significant decrease in mutation efficiency. This purification\ncan be performed by the primer synthesis facility and should be selected on the\norder form.\n\n(See section C1 of the appendix for an example of primer design)\n\nSESSION 4\n\nLaboratory Procedures\n\n1.) Preparation of Ni-affinity column buffers, dialysis stock buffer solution, and SDS-\nPAGE buffers: solutions for isolation and analysis of the H396P Abl kinase domain.\n\nThe Ni-NTA buffers and SDS-PAGE buffers will be shared by the class. Your TA will\ntherefore assign each group a total of three class buffers to prepare. Some of the buffer\npreparation protocols contain blanks, and for these you are must to calculate the required\namount of each reagent (in grams) to achieve the specified concentration. CONFIRM\nTHAT YOUR CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT WITH YOUR TA BEFORE YOU\nSTART TO PREPARE YOUR BUFFERS.\n\nYour TA will assign you to prepare one of the three Ni-NTA purification buffers\ndescribed below:\n\na) Ni-NTA binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.8). In a 1 L bottle,\ncombine _______ g of Tris base (FW 121.1), _______ g NaCl (FW 58.44),\nand 800 mL of cold water. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the\nfinal volume to 1L.\nb) Ni-NTA washing buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, pH\n7.8). In a 500 mL or 1L bottle, combine _______ g Tris base (FW 121.1),\n_______ g NaCl (FW 58.44), _______ g imidazole (FW 68.08), and 400 mL\nof water. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to\n500 mL.\nc) Ni-NTA elution buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, pH\n7.8). In a 500 mL or 1L bottle, combine _______ g Tris base (FW 121.1),\n_______ g NaCl (FW 58.44), _______ g imidazole (FW 68.08), and 400 mL\nof water. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to\n500 mL.\n\nEACH group must prepare a 10X stock of TBS for dialysis as indicated:\n\nd) 10X TBS (dialysis buffer) (200 mM Tris, 1.37 M NaCl, pH 7.5). In a 1 L\nbottle, combine _______ g Tris base, _______ g NaCl, and 800 mL of water.\nAdjust the pH to 7.5 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to 1 L.\n\nYou will be assigned two of the SDS-PAGE gel buffers below to prepare for the class to\nshare. Several of the buffers will be prepared by the TAs, as indicated:\n\ne) 10X electrophoresis buffer (Tank buffer). In a 2 L bottle, combine 60.4 g Tris\nbase, 288 g glycine, and 10 g SDS. Add water to a final volume of 2 L.\nf)\nCoomasie staining solution (provided by TA). 0.25 % Coomassie Brilliant\nBlue, 50 % methanol, and 10 % glacial acetic acid.\n\ng) 6X reducing protein loading buffer. For 15 mL of solution, combine 3.5 mL\nwater, 3.5 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.6 mL glycerol (use a positive\ndisplacement pipette for this viscous liquid), 1.0 g SDS, 930 mg DTT, and\n1.2 mg bromophenol blue. Store this solution at - 20 oC.\nh) Fast destain solution (provided by TA). 40% methanol and 10% glacial\nacetic acid. This solution can destain gels in 1-3 hours.\ni)\nSlow destain solution (provided by TA). 5% methanol and 10% glacial\nacetic acid. This solution is for destaining overnight.\nj)\n1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. In a 1 L bottle, add _______ g of Tris base and 800\nmL of water. Adjust the pH of the solution to 8.8. Add water to a final\nvolume of 1 L.\nk) 0.38 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. In a 1 L bottle, add _______ g of Tris base and 800\nmL of water. Adjust the pH with HCl to 6.8. Add water to a final volume of 1\nL.\nl)\n50 % sucrose, 100 mL\nm) 10 % ammonium persulfate (APS), 10 mL. store at 4 °C.\nn) 40% acrylamide/ bisacrylamide solution (provided by TA)\n\n2.) Preparation of BSA solutions and creation of a standard curve for the Bio-Rad protein\nquantification assay. (This can be completed anytime before session 6. At a minimum, you\nshould prepare the 1 mg/mL BSA stock solution today.)\n\nPrepare 5 mL of a 1 mg/mL aqueous solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA). To do\nthis, weigh out 5 mg of BSA into a 15-mL conical tube on the balance. Add 5 mL of\nwater and invert or vortex the tube to completely dissolve the BSA. Divide the stock\nsolution into 1-mL aliquots in 1.5-ml eppedorf tubes and store at -20 °C for use in protein\nquantification assays throughout Modules 4 and 5. Prior to each assay, you must prepare\nfive dilutions of your BSA stock solution to create a standard curve. The linear range of\nthe Bio-Rad protein assay is 0.2 to 0.9 mg/mL. Therefore in six separate 0.65-mL\neppendorf tubes, label and add the following: 270 μL of the BSA stock and 30 μL of\ndeionized water (to give 0.9 mg/mL), 210 μL of BSA and 90 μL of water (to give 0.7\nmg/mL), 165 μL of BSA and 135 μL of water (to give 0.55 mg/mL), 120 μL of BSA and\n180 μL of water (to give 0.4 mg/mL), 60 μL of BSA and 240 μL of water (to give 0.2\nmg/mL), and no BSA and 300 uL of water (to use as your \"blank\").\n\nPrepare 20 mL of the assay dye reagent by diluting 1 part Bio-Rad dye\nconcentrate with 4 parts DI water. Filter the resulting solution and store any unused\nreagent for up to two weeks at room temperature. To create a standard curve using your\nBSA standards, pipette 20 μL of each standard into an eppendorf tube. Add 980 μL of the\nprepared dye reagent to each tube and vortex briefly. Incubate the tubes at room\ntemperature for 5 to 50 minutes. Measure the absorbance of each solution at 595 nm by\nUV/Vis spectrometry using disposable polystyrene cuvettes. See Appendix A2 for\ninstructions on using the Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer. The sample with 20 μL of\nwater in 980 μL of assay reagent should be used as your \"blank\" in the\nspectrophotometer. Plot the absorbance vs. concentration for the BSA standards using\n\nMicrosoft Excel or another graphing program and determine the R-squared value and\nslope of the best-fit line to establish that you can obtain a strait line with your standards.\nPrint a copy for your lab report. If your R-squared value is less than 0.9, repeat the\nexercise until you achieve an acceptable line. Good laboratory practice calls for the\ncreation of a new standard curve each time you run a protein assay.\n\n3.) Hand in the order form for your primers. See your TA about entering your primer\ninformation onto an Invitrogen order form.\n\nSESSION 5\n\nWhile we wait for the DNA primers to arrive for the mutagenesis, we will focus on\npurifying the H396P Abl kinase domain. Today you will lyse your H396P Abl(229-511)/\nYop-containing pellet, and isolate the H396P Abl kinase domain via its amino-terminal\nhexahistidine tag.\n\nAffinity tag purification of recombinant proteins:\n\nA common strategy for isolating a recombinant protein from cell lysate is the use\nof an affinity tag, which is a small peptide or protein fragment that can reversibly bind to\na specifically-functionalized solid support. In affinity-based purification, the protein of\ninterest is expressed with a tag immediately amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal to the\nprotein. After cell lysis, the tagged protein is pulled out of the crude lysate through the\nbinding of the tag to affinity resin. The resin is copiously washed to remove any non-\nspecific binders, and the protein of interest is then eluted from the column by changing\nthe pH to reduce binding affinity or by introducing a competitive binder. Common\naffinity tags include the GST tag (a 27-kDa protein that binds glutathione coated beads),\nthe FLAG tag (an 8-residue peptide, DYKDDDDK, that binds a FLAG-antibody\nfunctionalized resin), and the hexahistidine tag (HHHHHH, which binds to Ni/NTA\nfunctionalized resin). Here we will utilize the hexahistidine tag appended to the amino-\nterminus of the Abl kinase domain. Since no other proteins in the bacteria have this tag,\nyou should be able to selectively isolate the hexahistidine-tagged H396P Abl(229-511)\nprotein. Elution of the target protein is accomplished by the addition of 100 to 200 mM\nimidazole, which competes for the Ni binding. The structure of imidazole and histidine\nare shown in Fig. 2 to demonstrate their identical Ni-coordination sites. In addition to\npurification applications, affinity tags can also be used for protein visualization on gels.\nFor example, an anti-hexahistine antibody conjugated with a fluorescent marker can be\nused to visualize which bands on a gel contain the hexahistidine tag.\n\nNH\nN\nN\nH\nN\nHistidine\nImidazole\n\nFigure 2. Structures of histidine and imidazole\n\nLaboratory\n\n1.) Cell lysis\nI. Thaw the cell pellet on ice or at room temperature.\nII. Add 10 mL of B-PER detergent and 100 μL of a 100X protease inhibitor cocktail\nsolution to the pellet in a 50-mL conical tube. Pipette up and down using a 10-mL\npipette until the cell suspension is homogenous. In order to maximize your protein\nyield, it is essential that the suspension is free of lumps and completely\nhomogenous before moving on to the next step. This may mean pipetting up and\ndown 40 or more times.\n\nIII. Add an additional 10 mL of B-PER and 100 μL of 100X protease inhibitor\ncocktail and pipette up and down 10 to 15 times to achieve a homogenous\nsuspension.\nIV. Gently agitate (by shaking or rocking) the suspension for 10 min at 4 oC.\nV. Centrifuge the tube at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Remember to balance the\ncentrifuge with a tube of equal mass, such as another group's cell lysis mixture.\nVI. Decant the solution (containing your soluble protein) into a fresh 50-mL conical\ntube. Add Ni-NTA binding buffer to a final volume of approximately 46 mL and\nimmediately continue on to the Ni-NTA purification. If necessary, you can store\nthe lysate on ice if you are waiting for Ni-NTA resin.\nVII. To discard of the cell pellet, add 30% bleach to the pellet in the conical tube. Let\nthe pellet sit in the bleach solution for at least 30 min, then dispose of the pellet\nand solution down the drain using plenty of water.\n\n2.) Purification of the H396P Abl kinase domain by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography\n\nWhile the purification will be carried out at room temperature on the benchtop, all buffers\nshould be stored at 4 oC and all elutions should be stored in an ice bucket.\n\nI. To your solution of crude peptide in binding buffer, add a total of 1 mL Ni-NTA\npre-activated resin. Note: 1 mL of resin is equivalent to 2 mL of a 50% resin\nslurry. The slurry can be transferred directly from the resin bottle to your 50-mL\nconical tube using a pipette.\nII. Gently agitate the resin with your protein solution for 20 min at 4 °C.\nIII. Carefully add the cell lysate/resin mixture to a 20-mL plastic column, and collect\nthe flow through in a 50-mL conical tube. It is very important that you never\nallow the resin to go dry! Make sure that there is always at least a small amount\nof buffer above the resin bed.\nIV. Once the cell lysate reaches the level of the filled resin, wash the resin with 10\nmL of binding buffer and then with 30 mL of washing buffer. Collect the flow\nthrough in a 50 mL conical tube.\nV. Elute the hexahistidine-tagged Abl protein from the column by adding 1.2-mL\naliquots of elution buffer. Collect each 1.2-mL aliquot in a separate, labeled 1.5-\nmL eppendorf tube. Collect 7 elution fractions in total. Fractions containing your\nprotein may be light blue from Ni that has eluted with the protein.\nVI. For subsequent gel analysis (in session 7) remove a 40-uL aliquot from each\nelution fraction. Carefully label these and store at 4 oC.\nVII. Combine your elution fractions and dialyze the protein into TBS as described (in\nsection 4.)) below.\nVIII. Wash the column with 10 mL of washing buffer, and deposit your used resin in\nthe designated container for regeneration.\n\n3.) Optional: Absorption measurements of Ni/NTA elution fractions\nMeasure the A280 of all fractions. See Appendix A2 for spectrophotometer\ninstructions. Absorption at 280 is a less sensitive detection method than visualization on\nan SDS-PAGE gel, so you may find that fractions with no detectible protein by UV/Vis\n\nhave protein present on a gel. In your lab report, you should compare the results for\ndetection by absorption at 280 nm with those for SDS-PAGE gel analysis.\n\n4.) Dialysis of the purified H396P Abl(229-511) protein\n\nSince the activity of some proteins can be damaged by prolonged storage in buffers with\nhigh concentration of imidazole, you will dialyze your eluted H396P Abl(229-511)\nfractions into TBS buffer. Consider the sizes (molecular weights) of the components in\nyou elutions: the hexahistidine tagged Abl kinase domain is approximately 32 kDa, and\nthe imidazole is 68 Da (0.068 kDa). Therefore using a 10 kDa MWCO (molecular weight\ncut off) dialysis device should easily enable removal of imidazole from the protein\nsolution.\n\nBased on the Ni-NTA elutions that contain detectable protein by absorption at 280 nm,\ncombine all elutions with a significant concentration of the Abl domain. (Alternatively,\nyou can combine all 7 elution fractions if you did not measure the A280 values.) Soak a\n10-kDa MWCO dialysis cassette in 1X TBS or water for at least ten minutes. Using a\nsyringe, carefully load the protein solution into the dialysis cassette. Be careful not to\npierce through the side of the cassette. Please have your TA observe you during this\nstep to ensure the correct protocol is being followed and that no protein is lost.\nUsing the Styrofoam floatation clips, float the cassette in 2 L of cold TBS. Dialyze your\nprotein at 4 °C overnight. In preparation for buffer exchange, chill another 2 L of TBS at\n4 °C overnight. Tomorrow you will exchange the dialysis buffer with the fresh pre-\nchilled TBS.\n\nSESSION 5B\n\nExchange the dialysis buffer with fresh pre-chilled TBS, and continue dialysis at 4 °C.\nThe used TBS can be poured down the drain to dispose.\n\nSESSION 6\n\n1.) Preparation of an SDS page gel\n\nSDS-PAGE gel analysis will allow you to check the identity (by molecular\nweight) and purity of the H396P Abl kinase domain. In an SDS gel, proteins are\nseparated based on their molecular weights. This occurs because the SDS (a detergent)\nbinds to all denatured proteins in an amount approximately proportional to the size of the\nprotein. This results in all proteins having an equal charge to mass ratios, since the\nnegatively-charged SDS masks any charges from the protein side chains. The protein size\nis thus the sole factor that affects its migration speed through the pores of the\npolymerized gel. The molecular weight of each protein can be deduced by comparing the\nmigration distance of the protein bands to that of a protein ladder, which is comprised of\nprotein samples with known molecular weights.\n\nAssembly of your SDS-PAGE gel\n\nI. Make up the 12 % running gel. In a 15-mL conical tube, combine 3 mL 40%\nacrylamide/ bisacrylamide solution, 2.4 mL 1.0 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1.2 mL 50%\nsucrose, 3 mL water, and 100 μL 10% SDS. Wait until a TA is by your side and\nwatching before you add the APS or TEMED. Once you are ready to pour the gel\nand your TA is watching you, add 250 μL of 10% APS solution and 2.5 μL of\nTEMED.\nII. Mix the solution by inverting 4-6 times, and then immediately transfer enough\nsolution to fill the gel cassette part way using a Pasteur pipette. Your TA will\ndemonstrate how high the running gel should be to leave sufficient room for the\nstacking gel and the gel comb. Once the gel is poured, add a thin layer of water to the\ntop of the running gel to keep the top level.\nIII. Allow the gel to polymerize, which can take up to 30 minutes. While the gel\npolymerizes, you can prepare the stacking solution (step IV) minus the APS and\nTEMED, which should not be added until just before the stacking gel is poured. Once\nthe running gel has solidified, decant the water layer and use filter paper to absorb\nany residual water.\nIV. Pour the stacking gel. In a 15 mL conical tube, combine 500 μL 40% acrylamide/\nbisacrylamide solution, 1.7 mL 0.38 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.5 mL water, and 50 μL\n10% SDS. Next add 400 μL 10% APS solution and 2.5 μL TEMED. Mix the solution\nby inverting 4-6 times, and pour the solution on top of the running gel to the top of\neach cassette.\nV. Quickly insert a comb into the stacking gel. The gel may take up to 30 minutes to\npolymerize. The purpose of the stacking gel is to concentrate the protein samples as\nthey enter the running gel.\nVI. Once the gels have polymerized, place the cassettes in a plastic container with 1X\nTank buffer. Wrap the container in saran wrap to prevent the gel from drying out and\nstore the gel at 4 oC. You will use your gel in Session 7.\n\n2.) Preparation of SDS-PAGE samples\n\nYou should prepare the following gel samples: pre-induction, post-induction, and all\nseven Ni-NTA column elution samples.\n\nTo prepare the pre- and post-induction samples, thaw the saved pellets at room\ntemperature, and add 24 μL of the 6X sample loading buffer to each pellet. For the\nelution samples, combine 20 μL of each sample with 4 μL of the 6X gel loading buffer in\n1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes. Boil all of the samples for 3 to 5 minutes to fully denature the\nproteins. The samples can be stored at room temperature until they are used in Session 7.\n\nSESSION 7\nNote: You have the option to combine Sessions 7 and 8 into one laboratory day if you\nwould prefer one long session instead of two short sessions.\n\nDuring Sessions 7 and 8 you will analyze the purified H396P Abl(229-511) by SDS-\nPAGE gel electrophoresis. You will also determine the concentration of your protein\ndomain after purification and dialysis.\n\n1.) Running an SDS-PAGE gel\nRemove your cast gel from the storage container, remove the white strip of tape from the\nbottom of your gel, and place the cassette in the gel running apparatus. Two gels fit in a\ngel box, so two groups of students should use each box. Fill the apparatus with 1X\nelectrophoresis (TANK) buffer such that the section between the two gels is filled to the\ntop and the outer sections are filled halfway with buffer. Carefully remove the gel comb.\nUsing gel-loading pipette tips on a 20p pipette, load 5 uL of protein ladder (provided by\nyour TA) into a corner well of your gel. The protein ladder consists of proteins with\nknown molecular weights conjugated to visible dyes and does not need to mixed with the\nsample loading buffer. See the posting on the -20 freezer or the figure below to identify\nthe molecular weight markers in the protein ladder. In the next two wells, load 10 uL of\nthe pre and post-induction samples. In the final 7 wells, load your Ni-NTA elution\nsamples. Run the gel at 200 V until the blue dye reaches the bottom of the gel\n(approximately 45 to 60 min).\n\nOnce the gel running is complete, disassemble the gel apparatus, and carefully pry\nthe cassette apart with a spatula. Transfer the gel into a container for staining. Running a\nlight stream of water over the gel can help prevent gel tearing during cassette separation\nand gel transfer. Add enough Coomasie blue staining solution to cover the gel (10 to 25\nmL), and place the container on the gel rocker. Rock the gel in the stain for 30 minutes.\nPour the used staining solution into a designated bottle, and rinse the gel with water. To\ndestain, cover the gel with fast destaining solution. Rock the gel at room temperature for\n30 to 50 min, then replace the fast destain with the slow destain solution and rock the gel\novernight. For the overnight destain, cover the container with saranwrap to avoid\nexcessive evaporation (especially during the winter months).\n\n250 kDa\n150 kDa\n100 kDa\n75 kDa\n50 kDa\n37 kDa\n25 kDa\n20 kDa\n15 kDa\n10 kDa\n\nBio-rad precision plus\n\nMolecular weight markers\n\nSESSION 7B\nAfter destaining, pour the destain solution in a designated waste bottle and check your gel\nfor protein bands. You should rinse the gel with water and take a digital picture for your\nlaboratory report. Once you have a decent picture of your gel, you may discard it.\n\nSESSION 8\n\n1.) H396P Abl(229-511) Protein Concentration\n\nUsing a syringe, transfer the dialyzed protein solution from the dialysis cassette into a 15-\nmL conical tube. The cassette cannot be reused and should be discarded after use.\n\nConcentrate the protein solution to a final volume of approximately 500 μL using a\nMillipore 10-KDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator. For concentration, add up to 12 mL\nat a time of your dialyzed protein solution to the concentrator tube and replace the cap.\nPlace the concentrator tube with the volume gradations facing up in the centrifuge. Add a\ncounterbalance, either another group's sample or a 50-mL conical tube with the\nappropriate volume of water to balance your concentrator tube. Spin at 500 x g until you\nreach the desired volume, approximately 15 to 45 minutes. Use a pipette to recover your\nconcentrated protein from the filter unit in the concentrator tube. For maximum protein\nrecovery, withdraw the protein from the bottom of the filter unit and use a \"side-to-side\nsweeping motion\". You should remove the concentrated protein solution as soon as\npossible following centrifugation.\n\nStore your protein in a clearly labeled eppendorf at 4 °C for use in Sessions 13 and 14.\n\n2.) Protein Quantification\n\nUse the Bio-Rad quantification assay (Session 4) to determine the protein concentration\nof the H396P Abl kinase domain after purification, dialysis, and concentration. See\nAppendix A1 for a review on preparing your BSA samples from the 1 mM BSA stock\nyou made in Session 4.\n\nClearly label the dialyzed protein with your names, your TA's name, and the date.\nStore the solution at 4 °C.\n\nSESSION 9\n\nDuring laboratory Sessions 9 and 10 you will perform site-directed mutagenesis to\nconstruct the DNA for a mutant Abl kinase domain with a single amino acid substitution.\nYou will transform cells for subsequent isolation of your mutant DNA.\n\n1.) Preparation of mutagenesis primers\n\nFor the mutagenesis reactions 10 μM solutions of your forward and reverse primers\nshould be prepared with ddH20. Before opening the primer containers, which contain\nyour primer DNA as lyophilized power, briefly centrifuge the tubes for 30 to 60 seconds.\nCalculate and add the necessary amount of water to achieve a 10 μM solution, and store\nyour primer solutions at 4 oC short term and at -20 °C long term.\n\n2.) Amplification of the mutant plasmid by PCR\n\nYou will set up a series of PCR reactions with various concentrations of DNA template\n(your isolated plasmid DNA) to produce plasmids containing the desired base-pair\nsubstitution. By varying the amount of DNA template, you will determine the reaction\nconditions that ultimately produce colonies with the least amount of template DNA\npossible, which maximizes the likelihood of isolating a colony with the desired mutation.\nWhile there must be enough template DNA to facilitate replication, too much template\ncan result in incomplete digestion after the PCR, resulting in undesired amplification of\nthe wild type DNA. Also essential for successful mutagenesis is the use of PfuTurbo as\nthe DNA polymerase. Unlike standard PCR reactions, which require replication of a 1 to\n2 kb insert, mutagenesis requires replication of an entire plasmid, which can be 5 or more\nkb (the pEt plasmid is approximately 6.1 kb with the Abl insert). PfuTurbo is used for its\nhigh fidelity and ability to extend very long templates.\n\nIn each of three sterile PCR tubes, add the following components in the order listed,\nwhere x = the volume of miniprep elution added (in μL) to give 10 ng of DNA.\n\n10 ng DNA\n\n20 ng DNA\n\n50 ng DNA\n10X Pfu buffer\n\n5 μL\n\n5 μL\n\n5 μL\ntemplate plasmid DNA\nx μL\n\n2x μL\n\n5x μL\n10 μM forward primer\n1.2 μL\n\n1.2 μL\n\n1.2 μL\n10 μM reverse primer\n1.2 μL\n\n1.2 μL\n\n1.2 μL\n10 mM dNTP mix\n\n1.0 μL\n\n1.0 μL\n\n1.0 μL\nddH20\n\n40.6 - x μL\n\n40.6 - 2x μL\n40.6 - 5x μL\nImmediately before starting the PCR machine, add:\nPfuTurbo, 2.5 units/ μL\n1.0 μL\n\n1.0 μL\n\n1.0 μL\n\n________\n\n________\n\n________\nFinal volume\n\n50 μL\n\n50 μL\n\n50 μL\n\nMix the reactions gently by pipetting 4-6 times, and place the tubes in the thermal cycler.\nThe length of the PCR program is critical for successful mutagenesis because the Pfu\n\npolymerase requires ample time to extend around the full plasmid. Your TA will\ndemonstrate how to set the following PCR program: 95 °C for 30 sec; [16-20 cycles of 95\n°C for 30 sec: 55 °C for 1 min: 65 °C for 2 min per kb plasmid]; then hold at 10 °C. Since\nthe plasmid you are using is approximately 6 kb, each 65 °C extension will be for 12 min.\nThe class should load the PCR reactions in the thermal cycler together and the TA will\nstart the run. The run will take over 4 hours, and the reaction tubes may be left overnight\nin the cycler after the run is complete.\n\nSESSION 9B\n1.) Remove your reaction from the thermal cycle and store at 4 oC.\n\nSESSION 10\n\n1.) DpnI digestion of the PCR reaction\n\nAs described in the Quikchange mutation overview (in Session 3), the purpose of DpnI\ntreatment is to digest away the template (wild type) DNA, such that the only remaining\nplasmid is the mutation-containing PCR product. Sufficiently high DpnI concentration\nand digestion time are essential for complete digestion of the template DNA in order to\nprevent carrying over the wt plasmid into the transformation, which could result in the\nisolation of wt, instead of mutated, DNA. For each 50-μL PCR reaction, transfer 10 μL of\nthe crude reaction into a fresh tube. Add 1 μL of DpnI (10 units/ μL) and mix thoroughly\nby pipetting 4-6 times. Transfer the 10-μL reaction to a new tube to ensure that all the\nDNA in the tube has been exposed to Dpn1. Incubate the digestion at 37 °C for at least 1\nhour. The crude digestion product can be used directly in a transformation reaction. Extra\nPCR and digestion products should be labeled and stored at -20 °C.\n\n2.) Preparation of LB/kan agar plates\n\nWhile the DpnI digestion incubates, prepare LB/kan agar plates for your transformation\nreaction. To prepare 4 plates, weigh out 5 g of LB powder and 3 g of bacto-agar in a 200-\nmL flask. Add 100-mL of water, and cover the top of the flask with aluminum foil. Add a\npiece of autoclave-indicator tape to the side of the flask and autoclave the solution for 20\nmin on the liquid cycle. Several groups should autoclave their media in a single autoclave\nrun to avoid extra waiting time. Once autoclaved, allow the solution to cool to\napproximately 55 oC, such that you can hold the flask comfortably. Add 100 μL of\n1000X kan to give a final concentration of 50 μg/ mL, and swirl the flask to mix.\nImmediately transfer 25-mL aliquots of the mixture to cell culture plates using a 100-mL\npipette. Allow the agar to solidify for at least 15 minutes before using. Store any unused\nplates at 4 oC.\n\n3.) Transformation of DH5α cells\n\nBacterial transformation involves the uptake of foreign DNA into a cell for subsequent\nexpression. While a small percent of bacterial species (approximately 1%) have the\ngenetic capacity to take in outside DNA through the cell membrane, transformation is\ncommonly achieved using procedures that render bacterial cells passively permeable by\nheat shock or electroporation. In this procedure, you will use heat-shock competent cells,\nwhich work best with plasmid DNA, for your transformation. Heat-shock competent cells\nare prepared by incubating the chilled cells with divalent metal ions to increase their\npermeability. After incubation with plasmid DNA, briefly heating the cells results in\nuptake of the foreign plasmid. Careful timing is essential to maximize DNA\nincorporation while minimizing cell destruction.\n\nPlates should be placed in the 37 °C incubator with the LB/agar side up.\n\nI. For each transformation reaction, thaw a single 30-uL aliquot of heat-shock\ncompetent DH5α cells in an ice bucket. Today you will set up a total of four\ntransformation reactions: three for the mutagenesis products and one as a positive\ncontrol with your isolated wt plasmid DNA. Competent cells cannot be refrozen\nfor later use, so please do not remove more aliquots then you will use from the -\n80 oC freezer.\nII. Keep your plasmid DNA from the DpnI digestions and your miniprep of wt Abl\nDNA chilled in the ice bucket\nIII. For each transformation reaction, add 25 μL of cells and 1 μL of DNA (either\nfrom the crude Dpn1 digestion mixture of from your miniprep) in a 1.5-mL sterile\neppendorf tube on ice. Typically, the DNA samples used are 0.5 to 1 μg/ μL. Mix\nthe cells gently by stirring with the pipette tip.\nIV. Heat shock the cells by placing the tubes in a 42 °C water bath for exactly 45\nseconds. Use a timer to ensure that the cells are not overexposed.\nV. Immediately transfer the tubes to an ice bucket. Incubate the cells on ice for 2\nminutes, then add 500 μL of SOB to rescue the cells.\nVI. Transfer the cell solutions to cell culture tubes.\nVII. Incubate the tubes at 37 °C in a shaker (220 rpm) for 30-60 minutes. 30 min.\nshould be adequate for routine transformations, such as this one.\nVIII. For each cell solution, plate 200 μL onto a room temperature or 37 °C LB/kan\nagar plate that has been divided into 4 sections by marker on the bottom of the\nplate. Streak the plate as shown by your TA across the four quadrants. Label\neach plate as mutant or wt, specify the point mutation on the mutant plates, and\ninclude the amount of DNA template used for the mutant reactions. Write your\nname and your TA's name on each plate as well.\nIX. Incubate the plates overnight in the 37 °C incubator.\n\nSESSION 10B\nPick individual colonies to grow up for DNA isolation (miniprep)\n\nAdd 3 mL of autoclaved LB solution (from your 100-mL preparation in week 1) into\neach of 3 cell culture tubes. Confirm that your LB media is contamination-free by\nchecking that the solution is clear. Add 3 μL of a 1000X (50 mg/ mL) kan stock solution\nto each tube to give a final concentration of 50 μL/mg kan.\n\nRemove your LB-kan agar plates from the 37 oC incubator. Confirm that your wt Abl\ntransformation was successful in generating hundreds or thousands of colonies on the\ndesignated plate. Estimate and record the number of colonies on the plates transformed\nwith DNA from your mutagesis with 10, 20, or 50 ng of template DNA.\n\nUsing a sterile pipette tip, transfer a colony to a cell culture tube from the mutant DNA\nplate with bacteria transformed with the mutagenesis mixture using the least amount of\ntemplate DNA. For example, if you have colonies on all of your plates, use the plate from\nthe mutagenesis reaction with 10 ng of DNA. This further decreases the likelihood of\nselecting a colony that contains wt DNA.\n\nSelect 2 more colonies from the same mutant DNA plate, and inoculate the solutions in\nthe other 2 cell culture tubes. Be careful to never mix colonies, since each colony\ncontains a different DNA clone and mixing could result in combining wt DNA with DNA\ncontaining the desired mutation.\n\nPlace the culture tubes in a 37 °C shaker overnight. During Session 11 you will isolate\nthe plasmid DNA from the 3 selected colonies.\n\nFor any groups that experimented with a new point mutation (that hasn't been optimized\nfor this lab), you may or may not have colonies from your mutant DNA transformations.\nIf you are not in one of the lucky groups with colonies, you should pick a colony from\nanother group's plate and record your new target mutation. Quikchange mutatgenesis\ncan require optimization and does not work for every mutation imaginable, and your\ngrade will NOT be affected by whether or not your mutagenesis succeeded, assuming\nyour primer design and Quikchange procedure were competently executed.\n\nSESSION 11\n\nToday you will isolate your mutant DNA from the transformed cells. You will then\ndesign primers (or use T7 primers) to sequence your mutant DNA and prepare samples\nfor sequencing.\n\n1.) DNA isolation of mutant plasmid DNA\n\nIsolate the DNA from your three selected colonies. A general miniprep procedure can be\nfound in Appendix A3 and is included below. Note that this is the same procedure that\nyou carried out for isolation of the wt Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid DNA in session 2.\nBased on your skillful lab work and a little luck, at least one of these plasmids should\ncontain the desired mutation.\n\nDNA isolation from a bacterial pellet (miniprep)\nhttp://www1.qiagen.com/literature/handbooks/PDF/PlasmidDNAPurification/PLS_QP_\nMiniprep/1043788_HB_QIAprep_122006.pdf\n\na.) Harvest the bacterial cells from your 3-mL overnight culture by transferring 1.5 mL\ninto a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and spinning down the cells in a microcentrifuge for 3\nminutes. Discard the supernatant and add the remaining 1.5 mL of cell culture to the tube.\nRepeat the centrifugation and discard the supernatant. You should have a small bacterial\npellet at the bottom of the tube.\nb.) Check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. Add 250 μL of Buffer P1 to the cell\npellet and completely resuspend the pellet by vortexing.\nc.) Add 250 μL of Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Do not vortex,\nsince that can cause shearing of the DNA. If you have properly lysed the cells, the cell\nsuspension will turn blue after the addition of the P2 buffer. If there are colorless regions\nor brown clumps in the cells, continue mixing until a homogenous blue solution appears.\nd.) Add 350 μL of Buffer N3 and mix immediately by inverting the tube 4-6 times. The\nsolution should become colorless and cloudy.\ne.) Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in you bench top microcentrifuge. A\ncompact white pellet should form.\nf.) Apply the resulting supernatant (which contains the plasmid DNA) to a QIAprep spin\ncolumn by decanting or pipetting.\ng.) Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow through.\nh.) Wash the spin column by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 s.\nDiscard the flow through.\ni.) Centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. This is essential for\nthe success of any future enzymatic reactions.\nj.) Place the QIAprep spin column into a clean and labeled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTo elute DNA, add 50 μL of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.5) to the center of the spin\ncolumn, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.\n\nFor long term storage, keep purified DNA at -20 °C.\n\n2.) Quantification of DNA concentration\nCalculate the concentration of each of your three miniprep elutions. For each sample,\ndissolve x μL (typically, 1-3 μL) in 100 μL of water. Measure the absorbance at 260 nm\nin a quartz cuvette. See Section Appendix A2 for UV/Vis spectrophotometer\ninstructions. To calculate the concentration in μg/μL of your double stranded (ds) DNA,\nmultiply the Abs260 by (0.05)(100/x). Typical concentrations of miniprepped DNA are\n0.1-2 μg/μL.\nCalculate the concentration of each of your three miniprep elutions, as was done\npreviously for your wt Abl(229-511)-containing plamid. See Appendix A4 for\ninstructions on measuring and calculating DNA concentration. You will use some of the\nminiprepped DNA for sequencing and should store the remaining DNA, labeled with the\ndesired mutation and numbered 1-3 at -20 °C.\n\n3.) Preparation of DNA sequencing samples\n\nYou will send the plasmid DNA isolated from the three selected colonies for DNA\nsequencing to check for the desired mutation. For each submission, combine the\nfollowing in a DNA sequencing tube:\n\n3.2 pmol of your sequencing primer\n\n200-500 ng of the plasmid DNA\n\nddH20 to a final volume of 12 μL\n\nLabel each tube with a 3 letter name that is distinguishable from all other samples in the\nclass, and fill in the information on a numbered sequencing sheet for the class. Make\nnote of the numbers of your samples as well as the names, since the sequencing can come\nback with numbers only.\n\nSESSION 12\n\nYou will be assigned one or several of the following buffers, all of which will be used for\nthe coupled phosphorylation assay in Sessions 13 and 14.\n\n- 10 x Kinase Buffer: 1 M Tris base (FW 121.14) pH 7.5, 100 mM MgCl2.This\nshould be prepared in several steps:\n1. First prepare 1 L of a 1M solution of Tris: In a 1 L bottle, combine\n_______ g Tris, and 0.8 L of room temperature DI water. Adjust the pH to\n7.5 with 1.0 M HCl. Add water to a final volume of 1 L.\n2. Next prepare 10 mL of an approximately 3 M solution of MgCl2-6H2O\n(FW 203.31) in 0.1 M HCl. Record the actual concentration of your\nsolution. The 0.1 M HCl keeps the solution acidic to prevent the MgCl2\nfrom crashing out of solution during storage.\n3. Prepare 10 mL of the 10 x kinase buffer (to avoid MgCl2 crashing out at\nneutral pH, do not store it for more than a few weeks). For example, if the\nMgCl2 solution was 2.66 M, you should add 385 uL of 2.66 M MgCl2 to\n9.615 mL of the 1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The Tris concentration will be\nonly negligibly less than 1 M.\n\n- 100 mM ATP, pH 7.5 (ε259 = 15400 M-1cm-1). ATP FW = 551.14 (anhydrous).\nTo prepare 9 ml of a 100 mM ATP solution, add g of ATP to 7 mL water.\nAdjust the pH of the solution to 7.5 using 1 M NaOH (approximately 1.3 mL will\nbe needed for the pH adjustment). Be careful NOT to overshoot the pH! If the\nsolution becomes too basic, the ATP will hydrolyze and will be useless in the\nupcoming kinase assay. If you overshoot the pH, you should discard your solution\nand start over.\n\nAfter reaching a pH of 7.5, add water to a final volume of 9 mL.\n\nDetermine the exact pH of the ATP solution by absorption spectroscopy. The\n\napparent weight of the ATP is likely to include some water, which results in a\n\nlower than expected concentration. Record the Abs at 259 for a 1/4000 dilution of\n\nthe ATP solution and calculate the actual ATP concentration using Beer's Law\n\n(Abs = εcl). Aliquot the ATP solution into 100-uL samples in 0.5 mL-eppendorf\n\ntubes and store the labeled-aliqots at -20 oC.\n\n- 35 mM PEP. FW = 208.04. Add 100 mg of PEP to 13.7 mL of water. Store the\nsolution in 200-μL aliquots in the -20 °C freezer. (provided by TA)\n\n- 12 mM NADH. (FW of the hydrate: 709.40). Since NADH easily takes on water\nweight, attempt a 14 mM solution by adding \"10 mg\"/mL of NADH. In a 15-mL\nconical tube, add \"5 mg\" of NADH to 0.5 mL of water.

For a 900 μL solution of peptide (final volume), add 25 mg (18\nμmol) of peptide to a 15-mL conical tube. Add 700 μL of 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5 or\nwater to the lyophilized peptide. The peptide solution will initially be very acidic\ndue to TFA contamination from peptide HPLC purification. To neutralize the\nsolution, add 1 M NaOH until the pH is approximately 7.5. For one previous\npreparation of this peptide, 9 uL of 1 M NaOH was required for neutralization,\nbut this will differ with every batch of peptide, depending on how much residual\nTFA is with the peptide. After neutralization, add 100 mM Tris buffer or water to\ngive a final volume of 900 μL. The peptide should be labeled, dated, and stored at\n-20 oC in 50-μL aliquots. (provided by TA)\n\nOnce the buffers above are made, all groups should prepare their own 1x assay buffer to\nuse in Sessions 13 and 14:\n\nPreparation of 2 mL* of 1 x assay buffer\n\nIn order to save time and allow you to easily and reproducibly repeat the coupled\nphosphorylation assay, you should prepare a 1x assay buffer that contains all of the\nreagents in the kinase assay except for the kinase, the substrate peptide, and the PK/LDH\n(coupling enzymes). Once you make up this buffer, you should store it at -20 °C. It is ok\nto freeze/thaw the buffer and use it as needed.\n\n* 2 mL refers to the final volume after the addition of the kinase, peptide, and PK/LDH.\nThe volume of the assay buffer alone will be 1.44 mL.\n\nFor 2 mL* of 1x assay buffer, combine the following in a 2 mL eppendorf tube:\n- μL of 10x kinase buffer\n- μL of 35 mM PEP for a final concentration of 1 mM\n- μL of mM ATP for a final concentration of 2 mM\n- μL of mM NADH for a final concentration of 0.11 mg/mL or 155\nμM.

You will recall\nthat kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of substrate peptides or\nproteins by transferring a phosphate group from a molecule of ATP to the substrate.\nPhosphorylation is spectroscopically silent, which means that we can monitor neither the\nformation of the phosphorylated product, nor the conversion of ATP to ADP directly\nusing spectroscopy. This is because the products would appear identical to the starting\nmaterials due to identical absorption features and extinction coefficients. In order to\nmonitor the activity of your wild type and mutant Abl kinase domains, you will therefore\nuse a coupled assay, which \"couples\" the conversion of ADP to ATP with the conversion\nof NADH to NAD+, a process that can be detected by a decrease in absorbance at 340\nnm. This coupling assay is outlined in Fig.3.\n\nFigure 3. The Kinase Coupled Assay for Abl Activity\n\nIt is possible to use the kinase coupled assay to generate quantitative kinetic data on the\nkinase of interest. You will use this assay to determine the specific activity of the wt and\nmutant Abl kinase domains in the absence and presence of small molecule inhibitors,\nincluding Gleevec. Specific activity in biochemistry is defined as the amount of product\nformed by an enzyme in a given amount of time. Specific activity is often reported in\nunits (U) per mg of enzyme, where 1 unit is equal to 1 μmol of product formed per\nminute.\n\n1.)

To\nprepare 5 mL of a 1 mg/mL aqueous solution of BSA, weigh out 5 mg of BSA into a 15-\nmL conical tube, add 5 mL of water, and invert or vortex the tube to completely dissolve\nthe BSA. BSA aliquots may be stored long term at -20 °C. Prior to each assay, prepare\nfive dilutions of the BSA stock solution to create a standard curve. The linear range of the\nBio-Rad protein assay is 0.2 to 0.9 mg/mL. Therefore in six separate 0.65-mL eppendorf\ntubes, label and add the following: 270 μL of the BSA stock and 30 μL of deionized\nwater (to give 0.9 mg/mL), 210 μL of BSA and 90 μL of water (to give 0.7 mg/mL), 165\nμL of BSA and 135 μL of water (to give 0.55 mg/mL), 120 μL of BSA and 180 μL of\nwater (to give 0.4 mg.mL), 60 μL of BSA and 240 μL of water (to give 0.2 mg/mL), and\nno BSA and 300 uL of water (to use as your \"blank\").\n\nPrepare 20 mL of the assay dye reagent by diluting one part Bio-Rad dye\nconcentrate with four parts DI water. Filter the resulting solution and store any unused\nreagent for up to two weeks at room temperature. To create a standard curve using the\nBSA standards, pipette 20 μL of each standard into an eppendorf tube. Add 980 μL of the\nprepared dye reagent to each tube and vortex briefly. Incubate the tubes at room\ntemperature for 5 to 50 minutes. Measure the absorbance of each solution at 595 nm by\nUV/Vis spectrometry using disposable polystyrene cuvettes. The sample with 20 μL of\nwater in 980 μL of assay reagent should be used as your \"blank\" in the\nspectrophotometer. Plot the absorbance vs. concentration for the BSA standards using\nMicrosoft Excel or another graphing program and determine the R-squared value and\nslope of the best-fit line to establish that you can obtain a strait line with your standards.\nIf your R-squared value is less than 0.9, repeat the exercise until you achieve an\nacceptable line. Good laboratory practice calls for the creation of a new standard curve\neach time you run a protein assay.\n\nTo determine the concentration of unknown samples, combine 20 uL of your\nsample (or an appropriate dilution) with 980 μL of assay reagent and measure the\nabsorbance at 595. Use the slope of the standard curve to calculate the sample\nconcentration in mg/mL.\n\nA2: Varian Cary 100 Spectrophotometer Instructions\n\n1. Turn on the spectrophotometer.\n2. Open the \"simple reads\" program, found as a desktop icon or under the Cary\nWinUV menu under the \"Start\" button.\n3. The lamps are on if under the \"Commands\" menu \"Lamps Off\" is displayed. If\n\"Lamps On\" is displayed, click on it to turn on the lamps. For accurate\nmeasurements, allow the lamp to warm up for at least 15 minutes before use.\n4. To set the instrument, click the \"Setup...\" command button on the left side of the\nscreen. In the \"Read the wavelength\" scroll box, type in the desired wavelength.\n\nThe \"Abs\" button in \"Y mode\" should be selected. When the setup is complete,\nclick the \"OK\" button to exit the window.\n5. Prior to measuring the absorbance of your samples, you must zero the instrument.\nTo do this, open the lid and determine which cell is in the light path. Insert a\ncuvette with your blanking solution in the instrument. Close the lid completely,\nand press the \"Zero\" command button on the left side of the screen to zero the\ninstrument at the chosen wavelength. The blank should now have a absorbance\nread of zero give or take the small amount of \"noise\" present at all times.\n6. You are now ready to measure the absorbance of your samples. Insert a cuvette\ncontaining a sample into the instrument, close the lid completely, and press the\n\"Read\" button at the top of the screen. Record the absorbance measurement.\n7. Under the \"File\" menu, select \"Print\" to print your data.\n8. When finished, close the program and return to the desktop.\n9. Turn off the lamps, then turn off the instrument.\n\nA3: DNA isolation from a bacterial pellet (miniprep)\nhttp://www1.qiagen.com/literature/handbooks/PDF/PlasmidDNAPurification/PLS_QP_\nMiniprep/1043788_HB_QIAprep_122006.pdf\n\nMiniprep Procedure:\na.) Harvest the bacterial cells from your 3-mL overnight culture by transferring 1.5 mL\ninto a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and spinning down the cells in a microcentrifuge for 3\nminutes. Discard the supernatant and add the remaining 1.5 mL of cell culture to the tube.\nRepeat the centrifugation and discard the supernatant. You should have a small bacterial\npellet at the bottom of the tube.\nb.) Check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. Add 250 μL of Buffer P1 to the cell\npellet and completely resuspend the pellet by vortexing.\nc.) Add 250 μL of Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Do not vortex,\nsince that can cause shearing of the DNA. If you have properly lysed the cells, the cell\nsuspension will turn blue after the addition of the P2 buffer. If there are colorless regions\nor brown clumps in the cells, continue mixing until a homogenous blue solution appears.\nd.) Add 350 μL of Buffer N3 and mix immediately by inverting the tube 4-6 times. The\nsolution should become colorless and cloudy.\ne.) Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in you bench top microcentrifuge. A\ncompact white pellet should form.\nf.) Apply the resulting supernatant (which contains the plasmid DNA) to a QIAprep spin\ncolumn by decanting or pipetting.\ng.) Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow through.\nh.) Wash the spin column by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 s.\nDiscard the flow through.\ni.) Centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. This is essential for\nthe success of any future enzymatic reactions.\nj.) Place the QIAprep spin column into a clean and labeled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTo elute DNA, add 50 μL of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.5) to the center of the spin\ncolumn, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.\n\nFor long term storage, keep purified DNA at -20 °C.\n\nA4: Quantification of DNA concentration\nDissolve x μL (typically, 1-3 μL) of DNA sample in 100 μL of water. Measure the\nabsorbance at 260 nm in a quartz cuvette. See Section Appendix A2 for UV/Vis\nspectrophotometer instructions. To calculate the concentration in μg/μL of your double\nstranded (ds) DNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.05)(100/x). Typical concentrations of\nminiprepped DNA are 0.1-2 μg/μL. To calculate the concentration of single stranded (ss)\nDNA or RNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.04)(100/x) instead.\nTo convert the concentration to mol/L, use the fact that 1 base pair has a molecular\nweight of ~650 g/mol, so a 5 kb plasmid has a typical molecular weight of 3.3x106 g/mol.\nFor ssDNA or RNA, use a molecular weight of 325 g/mol per nucleotide.\n\nAPPENDIX B: Protein and Nucleotide Sequences\n\nB1: Protein Sequence of c-Abl(229-511) (283 AA; 32,730 MW) from ABL1_HUMAN\nSwissprot accession number: P00519 (http://www.expasy.org/uniprot/P00519).\nNumbering is for isoform 1A.

If provided in\nAppendix B3, confirm that the numbering of the nucleotide substitution falls\nwithin the codon determined above (here 1189-1191), and use a translator tool to\nensure that the bp change results in the expected amino acid substitution. If the\nDNA change is not listed, determine which nucleotide substitution gives the\ndesired amino acid change.

Also\nplace the plasmid Abl and Yop DNA tubes on ice until ready for use.\n2) Add 40-50 μL of the cells to a 1.5-mL eppendorf tube on ice.\n3) Carefully mix 1 μL of the Yop plasmid DNA and 1 μL of the Abl plasmid\nDNA with the cells. (Note: the plasmid DNA was from a miniprep at ~ 100\n\ni\n\nng/uL. The transformation should work well, however, for a range of\nconcentrations.)\n4) Move the tube from the ice bath to a 42 oC water or oil bath for EXACTLY 45\nseconds.\n5) Immediately transfer the tube back onto ice, and incubate on ice for 2 minutes.\n6) Rescue the cells with the addition of 600 μL of SOB media.\n7) Incubate the tube at 37 oC with end-over-end rotation for 1 hour.\n8) Plate 100- 500 μL of the cell solution on pre-warmed kan/strep LB plates.\n(The plates should have kan and strep at 50 μg/mL each.)\n9) Incubate overnight at 37 oC.\n\nMake a glycerol stock of the transformed cells.\nTo make a glycerol stock:\n1) Pick a colony from a fresh plate (no more than 2 days old), and inoculate a 1-mL\nculture of LB (with kan and strep).\n2) Grow culture until OD600 = 0.5 (do NOT overgrow).\n3) Transfer 600 μL of culture to a 1.5 μL sterile tube.\n4) Add 600 μL of sterile 50% glycerol to the tube for a 25% final glycerol\nconcentration.\n5) Invert tube to mix. Make sure to carefully label the tube with the date, cell type,\nand plasmid(s).\n6) Flash freeze in liquid nitrogen.\n7) Store at -80. For easy identification, place the tube in a small plastic bag with a\nmore detailed paper label inside.\n\nDuring Session 1:\n\nYou should introduce the students to sterile technique by explaining the\nimportance of autoclaving media and equipment and demonstrating the use of pipettes.\nTo demonstrate, add 6 mL of sterile LB to a cell culture tube, since the students will have\nto do this at the end of class. Advise them to keep their bench-top area clean by wiping it\ndown with 70% ethanol. Point out when to use sterilized tips and when it is ok to use\nnon-sterile tips. Also explain that we must make the assumption that the air is sterile.\n\nSince the safety lecture is now part of session 1, the TAs (rather than the students)\nwill have prepared a 500-mL and a 100-mL solution of sterile LB. Please distribute the\nLB solutions to the students and explain that they are responsible for preventing\ncontamination of their LB.\nAt some point during the lab period (before or after the students leave), the TA\nshould prepare a fresh plate containing bacteria with Abl(229-511) and a plate with\nbacteria containing both the H396P Abl and Yop phosphatase. Accordingly, set out an\nLB/kan and an LB/kan/strep plate on the bench top to warm to room temperature. Take a\nscraping of the glycerol stock (from the Klibanov -80 oC freezer) of DH5α cells with the\nAbl-encoding plasmid using a pipette tip and drop the tip into 1 mL of LB with 50 μg/mL\nkan in a cell culture tube. Work quickly to make sure that the cells do not thaw before\nyou return them to the freezer. Place the tube in the 37 oC shaker for 5 to 30 min, and\nthen spread about 200 μL of the solution onto the LB/kan plate. Similarly, take a scraping\nof the glycerol stock of Yop-plasmid/H396P Abl-plasmid containing BL21-DE3 cells\n\nii\n\nwith a pipette tip and drop the tip into 1 mL of LB with 50 μg/mL kan and 50 μg/mL\nstrep in a cell culture tube. Place the tube in the 37 oC shaker for 5 to 30 min, and then\nspread about 200 μL of the solution onto the LB/kan/strep plate. Place the plates in the 37\noC incubator overnight.\n\nSESSION 1B (lab open 1-2 pm)\n\nDemonstrate to the students how to pick a colony from the plates. Inoculate 2 sets of\nculture tubes as described for the students in case some groups add the colonies to the\nmedia with the wrong set of antibiotics. Make sure the students check that their media is\nnot cloudy (contaminated) before they add the antibiotics. Give them some of the extra\nmedia prepared by the TAs if their media is bad. Once everyone has picked their\ncolonies, wrap the plates with parafilm and store them at 4 oC.\n\niii\n\nSESSION 2 (lab open 1-5 pm)\n\nDemonstrate use of the two shakers (37 °C and room temperature). The heated shaker\nshould be set to 250 rpm. Please note that the room temperature shaker does not have an\nrpm speed setting, but instead is numbered 1-10. Set the speed to just above 5, which is\nclose to 250 rpm. Advise students to start checking the OD of their media 2 hours after\ninoculation.\n\nYou should also demonstrate proper use of the UV/Vis spectrophotometer, although this\ncan wait until after everyone has started protein expression. Remind students to use the\nquartz cuvettes for the DNA measurements and the plastic (disposable) cuvettes for the\nOD measurements. For the miniprep procedure, demonstrate proper use of the bench top\ncentrifuges and explain the importance of keeping the samples balanced. Also show the\nstudents how to use the large centrifuges so they will be prepared for tomorrow to spin\ndown their cell pellets from the 500 mL growth that they will induce today.\n\nFor the miniprep procedure, check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. If not, add\nthe RNaseA. Buffer P1 should be stored at 4 oC following RNaseA addition. Each group\nshould receive a freezer box for storage of their isolated DNA in the -20 °C freezer.\n\niv\n\nSESSION 3\n\nTAs should prepare the following buffers for week sessions 3 and 4:\n\n- 10X TAE buffer. In a 1 L bottle, combine 48.4 g Tris base, 10.9 mL glacial acetic\nacid, 2.92 g EDTA (free acid, FW 292.25), and 1 L of water. The pH should be\nbetween 8.1 and 8.3 and should not require adjustment.\n- Coomasie staining solution. 0.25 % Coomassie Brilliant Blue, 50 % methanol,\nand 10 % glacial acetic acid. Prepare 500 mL. Store at room temperature.\n- Fast destain solution. 40% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid. Prepare 1 L.\n- Slow destain solution. 5% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid. Prepare 1 L.\nStore both destain solutions at room temperature.\n- 40% acrylamide/ bisacrylamide solution. Follow the instructions on the bottle.\nStore at 4 oC.\n- 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution. (Use extreme caution when working\nwith EtBr. It is a suspected carcinogen and teratogen. Wear nitrile gloves and\nwork with the powder form only in a hood.)\n\nAt the start of session 3, demonstrate setting up a DNA gel box to pour and run a\ngel. Stress that the DNA runs from the negative to the positive end of the gel, and show\nthem which end to load their DNA on. Review what results should be expected on the gel\nfrom the four digestions. On the board, draw a diagram of the vector with the Abl insert\nand discuss the expected outcome after Xho1 digestion, Nde1 digestion and Xho1/ Nde1\ndigestion.\nAdvise the students to select a mutation from the list of Abl mutants found in\nGleevec-resistant CML patients (Appendix B3) and record each pairs' target mutation.\nNote that the Quikchange is NOT always successful, but that the students are\nencouraged to try any mutant of their choice. Mutations that have worked in the\npast are S417Y (this one is the most consistently successful) and G250E. Mutations\nthat have failed in the past are F486S, M351T, and E255K. However, the\nunsuccessful mutations may have failed due to student error or may just require\nQuikchange optimization.\n\nv\n\nSESSION 4\n\nPrepare two to three 200-mL bottles of 1.0 M HCl for pH adjustments in session 4. Make\nsure that any concentrated HCl used for pHing by the students is also in a small\ncontainer. Prior to session 4, check ALL of the pH meters and confirm that they are\nworking properly.\n\nAssign each group of students three class buffers to prepare: one of the Ni-NTA\npurification buffers (a, b, c) and two of the SDS-PAGE buffers (e and g, j and l, or k and\nm). Every group should make their own 10X dialysis buffer, solution d. You may end up\nhaving more than one group make a buffer, which is fine. Preparing buffers is an\nimportant skill for the students, so please still assign each group 3.\n\nFor the BSA protein assays, please review proper use of the UV/Vis spectrophotometer.\n\nToday primer proposals are due for the DNA mutagenesis. Check the primer proposal for\neach group of students and help them enter in the primer information on the Invitrogen\norder form. Follow the primer ordering instructions that are included with the\nequipment/supply ordering sheets.\n\nThe students need to check their calculations with you prior to preparing the\nbuffers. The correct values are included below.\n\nYour TA will assign you to prepare one of the three Ni-NTA purification buffers\ndescribed below:\na) Ni-NTA binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.8). In a 1 L bottle,\ncombine 6.1 g of Tris base (FW 121.1), 17.5 g NaCl (FW 58.44), and 800 mL\nof cold water. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the final\nvolume to 1L.\nb) Ni-NTA washing buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, pH\n7.8). In a 500 mL or 1L bottle, combine 3.05 g Tris base (FW 121.1), 8.75 g\nNaCl (FW 58.44), 1.02 g imidazole (FW 68.08), and 400 mL of water. Adjust\nthe pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to 500 mL.\nc) Ni-NTA elution buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, pH\n7.8). In a 500 mL or 1L bottle, combine 3.05 g Tris base (FW 121.1), 8.75 g\nNaCl (FW 58.44), 6.8 g imidazole (FW 68.08), and 400 mL of water. Adjust\nthe pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to 500 mL.\n\nEACH group must prepare a 10X stock of TBS for dialysis as indicated:\nd) 10X TBS (dialysis buffer) (200 mM Tris, 1.37 M NaCl, pH 7.5). In a 1 L\nbottle, combine 24.2 g Tris base, 80.1 g NaCl, and 800 mL of water. Adjust\nthe pH to 7.5 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to 1 L.\n\nYou will be assigned two of the SDS-PAGE gel buffers below to prepare for the class to\nshare. Several of the buffers will be prepared by the TAs, as indicated:\n\nvi\n\ne) 10X electrophoresis buffer (Tank buffer). In a 2 L bottle, combine 60.4 g Tris\nbase, 288 g glycine, and 10 g SDS. Add water to a final volume of 2 L.\nf)\nCoomasie staining solution (provided by TA). 0.25 % Coomassie Brilliant\nBlue, 50 % methanol, and 10 % glacial acetic acid.\ng) 6X reducing protein loading buffer. For 15 mL of solution, combine 3.5 mL\nwater, 3.5 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.6 mL glycerol (use a positive\ndisplacement pipette for this viscous liquid), 1.0 g SDS, 930 mg DTT, and\n1.2 mg bromophenol blue. Store this solution at - 20 oC.\nh) Fast destain solution (provided by TA). 40% methanol and 10% glacial\nacetic acid. This solution can destain gels in 1-3 hours.\ni)\nSlow destain solution (provided by TA). 5% methanol and 10% glacial\nacetic acid. This solution is for destaining overnight.\nj)\n1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. In a 1 L bottle, add 121.1 g of Tris base and 800 mL\nof water. Adjust the pH of the solution to 8.8. Add water to a final volume of\n1 L.\nk) 0.38 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. In a 1 L bottle, add 46 g of Tris base and 800 mL\nof water. Adjust the pH with HCl to 6.8. Add water to a final volume of 1 L.\nl)\n50 % sucrose, 100 mL\nm) 10 % ammonium persulfate (APS), 10 mL. store at 4 °C.\nn) 40% acrylamide/ bisacrylamide solution (provided by TA)\n\nvii\n\nSESSION 5\n\nFor cell lysis, stress the importance of fully homogenizing the pellet in the B-PER\ndetergent. For the purification, review the concept of an affinity tag on the board. Remind\nthe students not to disturb the resin bed in the purification procedure. Label a container\n\"used Ni/NTA resin\". The used resin should be stored in the binding buffer at 4 °C for\nsubsequent regeneration.\n\nFor the protein dialysis, have the students make up 1X TBS from their 10X solutions\nearly in the lab period, and store the TBS (dialysis buffer) in the fridge so it is cold for the\nprotein dialysis.\n\nPrepare 20 mL of a 10% SDS solution in water. Store in a 50-mL eppendorf tube at room\ntemperature.\n\nviii\n\nSESSION 6\n\nDemonstrate the set up for pouring an SDS gel and placement of the poured gel in the gel\nbox. The gel combs should face inward and either two gels or a gel and a blank cassette\nmust be inserted. Point out how far to fill the gel with the resolving gel solution to leave\nadequate room for the stacking gel and gel comb (up to the highest line on the gel\ncassette).\n\nSESSION 7 and 8\n\nStudents can combine these sessions into a single day or have two very short lab days.\n\nOne TA should prepare the following for session 7:\n\n- Protein ladder: Prepare 20 μL aliquots and store at -20 oC.\n\nReview setting up a gel box and loading protein samples. Demonstrate how to\nscan a gel (or take a picture) for the report. Designate and label a bottle for used\nCoomassie blue stain. The stain can be reused. Label a waste bottle for used destain\nsolution. Remind the students that they must not pour these solutions down the sink.\nProvide the students with an aliquot of protein ladder from the -20 oC freezer for the\nSDS-PAGE gels. If time is running short, you can speed up the staining and destaining\nprocess by heating the gels and stain (or destain) in the microwave for 15 seconds at a\ntime for 3 to 4 times total. If you do this, be careful not to inhale deeply when you open\nthe microwave, since both the stain and destain solutions contain acetic acid.\n\nix\n\nSESSION 9\n\nOne TA should prepare the following aliquots for Sessions 9 and 10:\n- PfuTurbo: Prepare 10 μL aliquots and store at -20 oC. One aliquot should be\nsufficient for 3 pairs of students.\n- SOB media. In a 1-L bottle, combine 20 g tryptone (2%), 5 g yeast extract (0.5%),\n584 mg NaCl (10 mM), 186 mg KCl (2.5 mM), and 1.2 g MgSO4 (FW 120.37, 10\nmM). Add water to a final volume of 1 L. Dissolve the powder, aliquot the\nresulting solution into 100 mL bottles and autoclave for 40 min in the liquid\ncycle. Meanwhile, prepare a MgCl2 solution: Dissolve 2.03 g MgCl2\n.6H2O (FW\n203.31) in 20 mL of water and filter through a 0.2 micron filter into a sterile\ncontainer. Into each 100-mL bottle of autoclaved media, add 2 mL of the filtered\nMgCl2 solution. Store the SOB media at room temperature.\n- A \"Used Magic Bead\" container (If you decide to use magic beads instead of\nspreaders). A small container (50-200 mL) should be filled 1⁄4 full with ethanol\nand labeled for used magic beads.\n- Sterile 1.5-mL eppendorf tubes. Check that there is a sufficient number of sterile\neppendorf tubes for the DH5α cell aliquots and for the class transformation\nprocedure. If not, autoclave at least 200 tubes in a glass beaker covered with\naluminum foil on the dry cycle (40 minutes for sterilization and 20 minutes for\ndrying).\n- DH5α cell aliquots. Thaw a tube of DH5α cells on ice. Prepare 30-uL aliquots in\nsterile 1.5-mL eppendorf tubes. Flash freeze the cells with liquid nitrogen by\npouring the tubes in a dewer and pouring in enough liquid nitrogen to cover the\ntubes. Either wait for the liquid nitrogen to evaporate or remove the tubes with\ntweezers and immediately freeze the cell aliquots at -80 °C. Do not submit the\ncells to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. If an aliquot is thawed, it should be used or\ndiscarded.\n\nAt the start of session 9, demonstrate programming and running the PCR thermal\ncycler and load the following program for the class: 95 °C for 30 sec; [20 cycles of 95 °C\nfor 30 sec: 55 °C for 1 min: 65 °C for 12 min]; 10 °C for infinity. The class will do a\nsingle run (depending on the tube capacity of the PCR), so all the samples should be\nloaded at roughly the same time. Advise the students to wait until the entire class is ready\nfor the run before they add the PfuTurbo polymerase. Once all the samples are loaded,\nstart the run.\n\nx\n\nSESSION 10\n\nFor plate pouring, each group will need to autoclave a 100-mL solution of media\nfor a 20-minute liquid cycle. You should do the actual autoclaving once the students have\nprepared the solutions. Organize the timing such that the class can accomplish their\nautoclaving in one or two runs. In addition, you should advise the students to start\nimmediately with their DpnI digestions, since they will need to incubate the digestions\nfor at least 1 hour before beginning the transformations.\n\nSESSION 10B\n\nIf there are any students that were unsuccessful in generating a single colony,\nhave them pick three colonies from another student's plate. Since some of the colonies\nmay contain wild-type DNA or other undesired mutations, this doubles the chance that a\ndesired mutant will be isolated from that plate. Remind the students that they are\ntherefore still making an important contribution, even if their own mutant failed to\nproduce colonies.\n\nxi\n\nSESSIONS 11 and 12\n\nPrior to session 12: TA's should prepare 1 M NaOH for adjusting the pH of the ATP\nsolution. Please also check ALL of the pH meters and confirm that they are working\nproperly.\n\nTAs should remind the students that mutagenesis is not always successful on the first try\nand occasionally extensive optimization in necessary. Students should realize that they\nare doing new, untested experiments, so they should not be discouraged if their\nmutagenesis was not successful on this first attempt. Remind them that we still have the\nprimers and another group of students can try for that mutation next year.\n\nFill out the form for DNA sequencing and have the students enter their constructs. The\nstudents should each include 3 correctly labeled samples. Make a copy of the sequencing\nform before submitting, so you can match the numbers with the correct students, in case\nanyone forgot to copy down that information.\n\nSESSION 12 (lab open 1-4 pm)\n\nTAs should prepare the NADH stocks, peptide stocks, and PEP, if there are insufficient\nstocks in the freezer. It is essential that the peptide stock is at neutral pH. Divide the\nremaining solutions among the group of students. Check their calculations before they\nstart the buffer preparation.\n\nPrepare inhibitor solutions: 100 μM of Gleevec in DMSO and a 100 μM of Dasatinib in\nDMSO. You will need less than 50 μL of each solution for the class assays, but make\nlarge enough solutions that you are able to measure the inhibitors accurately. Split the\nsolutions into 10-μL aliquots to avoid excessive handling by the students. Inhibitor\nsolutions should be made fresh each semester and should be stored at -20 °C.\n\nFor Sessions 13 and 14 (kinase assays) the class period will be split up into two time\nslots: 1-3 and 3-5. Have half of the class sign up for each of these time slots prior to\nthose sessions.\n\nCalculations for 10x kinase buffer and ATP solution (full instructions are in the manual):\n- 10 x Kinase Buffer: 1 M Tris base (FW 121.14) pH 7.5, 100 mM MgCl2.This\nshould be prepared in several steps:\n1. First prepare 1 L of a 1M solution of Tris: In a 1 L bottle, combine 121.1 g\nTris, and 0.8 L of room temperature DI water. Adjust the pH to 7.5 with\nHCl (it is recommended to start with concentrated HCl and then switch to\n1.0 M HCl as you get close to the desired pH.) Add water to a final\nvolume of 1 L.\n\n- 100 mM ATP, pH 7.5 (ε259 = 15400 M-1cm-1). ATP FW = 551.14 (anhydrous).\nTo prepare 9 ml of a 100 mM ATP solution, add 0.5 g of ATP to 7 mL water.\n\nxii\n\nAdjust the pH of the solution to 7.5 using 1 M NaOH (approximately 1.3 mL will\nbe needed for the pH adjustment).\n\nCalculations for the assay buffer:\n\nFor 2 mL* of 1x assay buffer, combine the following in a 2 mL eppendorf tube:\n- 200 μL of 10x kinase buffer\n- 57 μL of 35 mM PEP for a final concentration of 1 mM\n- 40 μL of 100 mM ATP for a final concentration of 2 mM\n- 25.8 μL of 12 mM NADH for a final concentration of 0.11 mg/mL or 155 μM.\n(Make sure the frozen stock that you use is recent.)\n- 1,117.2 μL of distilled water to give a \"final\" volume of 1440 μL\n\n(This leaves 560 μL of spare volume for the enzymes and peptide.)\n\nStore your 1x assay buffer in 400-μL aliquots in the -20 C freezer. Label your tubes well\nso they are not confused with the 10x kinase buffer!\n\nxiii\n\nSESSION 13 and 14\n\nSince the students may need a lot of individualized attention during the assays, split each\nsession into two time slots to run the assays. Half of the class should come to lab from 1-\n3 pm, and the remaining half should come to lab from 3-5 pm.\n\nDouble check that there is sufficient commercial wt Abl kinase for all of the groups to\nrun the assay in the absence of an inhibitor and in the presence of Gleevec and Dasatinib.\nThis is a total of 3 assay runs with wt Abl, requiring 9 uL of Abl enzyme per group.\nOrder more enzyme at least two workdays ahead of time if required.\n\nPrior to Session 13, do a test run of all assays to make sure that the reagents are good and\nthe UV spec. is working properly. Remake reagent and inhibitor aliquots as needed.\nInhibitor aliquots should be made fresh each semester. The expected specific activity for\nthe wt Abl kinase domain in the absence of inhibitor is 3-4 U/mg. The specific activity\nfor the purified H396P mutant is typically 10 fold lower.\n\nxiv\n\nSESSION 15\n\nThis session is held in a computer room (typically room 1-115). Bring the session 15\nanswer key to class to help answer any questions.\n\nSince this is the final lab class, please remind the students about their upcoming journal\nclub presentation and have them check out of the lab.\n\nxv"

During laboratory Sessions 1\nand 2 you will express the H396P Abl kinase domain. You will also isolate wild type (wt)\nAbl plasmid DNA for subsequent mutagenesis.\n\n1) Preparation of LB media (the details in grey may be prepared by your TA)\nLB (Luria-Bertani) media must be prepared and sterilized for use in the bacterial growth\nand protein expression you will carry out in the next few sessions. The media should\ncontain a final concentration of 1% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract and 1.0% NaCl in\nwater. Using the premixed powder, add 25 g of LB powder/ L of water to achieve the\ndesired concentrations. Prepare a 500-mL solution of LB in a 1-L flask and a separate\n100-mL solution in a 200-mL container. For sterilization, cover the containers with\naluminum foil and make sure the cap is not screwed onto the 200-mL container. Stick a\npiece of autoclave indicator tape on the side of each flask. The tape will turn color upon\nreaching a sufficient sterilization temperature. Your TA will autoclave the media for 20\nmin. Once the sterilized LB media has cooled enough for you to hold the flask\ncomfortably, use sterile technique to add kanamycin (kan) and streptomycin (strep)\n(antibiotics) to a final concentration of 50 μg/mL each to the 500-mL solution. The TA's\nwill provide you with a 50 mg/ mL stock of strep and a 50 mg/ mL stock of kan, so you\nshould add 500 μL of strep and 500 μL of kan to the 500 mL of LB. Do not add\nantibiotics to the 200-mL bottle, and screw the cap on tightly once the solution has cooled\ncompletely.\n\nUsing sterile technique demonstrated by your TA, transfer two 6-mL and one 10-mL\naliquots of LB from the 200-mL bottle into three cell culture tubes. Tomorrow you will\ncheck to confirm that your tubes have remained clear, indicating that you have used good\nsterile technique. If your media becomes cloudy (other than after intentional inoculation),\nit means the solution has been contaminated, and you must prepare fresh media.\n\nSESSION 1B (lab open 1-2 pm)\n1) Inoculation of LB/ kan with E. coli containing a plasmid encoding the wt Abl kinase\ndomain\n\nConfirm that your LB media is contamination-free by checking that the solutions are\nclear. Add 6 μL of the kan 50 mg/mL stock solution to each of the culture tubes\ncontaining 6 mL of LB to give a final concentration of 50 μg/mL kan. Using a sterile\npipette tip, transfer half of a colony from a freshly-transformed bacterial plate (supplied\nby your TA) to a culture tube. You should drop the entire pipette tip into the solution.\nWith a second pipette tip, transfer the other half of the colony to the second tube. The\ncolonies on the plate are DH5-α E. coli cells, which are ideal bacterial storage cells to\nhold a vector of interest (in this case an Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid). Place the\nculture tubes in a 37 °C shaker overnight. In session 2 you will isolate the Abl kinase\ndomain plasmid DNA from the bacteria that grows up overnight.\n\n2) Inoculation of LB/ kan/ strep with E. coli containing plasmids encoding the H396P\nAbl kinase domain and the Yop phosphatase\n\nAdd 10 μL of the 50 mg/mL kan stock solution and 10 μL of the 50 mg/mL strep stock\nsolution to the culture tube containing 10 mL of LB to give a final concentration of 50\nμg/mL of each antibiotic. Using a sterile pipet tip, transfer a colony of H396P Abl(229-\n511)/ Yop-containing bacteria from a plate (supplied by your TA) to the culture tube. The\ncolonies on the plate are called BL21-DE3 cells, which are a cell-line commonly used for\nprotein expression. Place the culture tube in a 37 °C shaker overnight. In session 2 you\nwill use this \"starter culture\" to inoculate your 500-mL LB solution to express the H396P\nAbl(229-511) and Yop proteins."

Expression of the H396P Abl kinase domain in the presence of Yop phosphatase\n\nInoculate 500 mL of LB/ kan/ strep with your 10-mL starter culture of bacteria containing\nthe ABL and YOP genes. Place the flask in the 37 °C shaker and periodically check the\nOD600 (optical density or absorbance at 600 nm) using the UV/Vis spectrometer. Use\n(non-inoculated) LB as the sample blank. Review the spectrometer instructions in\nAppendix A2. Once the OD600 reaches 0.1, the density should double approximately\nevery 20 minutes, which should help you plan when next to check the OD. When the\nmedia reaches an OD600 of 0.8 to 1.0, remove the flask from the 37 °C shaker and place\nit in the 24 °C shaker. At this point, transfer 1 mL of the culture to a 1.5-mL eppendorf\ntube and spin it down for 3 minutes in a bench top microcentrifuge. Remove the\nsupernatant and store the pellet at -20 °C. This is your pre-induction sample for\nsubsequent gel analysis. After the cell culture has been shaking at 24 °C for at least 10\nminutes (or up to one hour), induce protein expression with the addition of IPTG. Add\n100 μL of 1M IPTG to give a final concentration of 0.2 mM IPTG. Let the culture grow\nat 24 °C overnight.\n\n2.) Isolation of the wt Abl plasmid DNA from the two 6-mL overnight cultures.\n\nWhile you monitor the OD of your H396P Abl(229-511)/ Yop expression, you should\nconcurrently work to isolate the plasmid DNA from your two 6-mL overnight bacterial\ncultures, which contain the wt Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid. You will use the isolated\nplasmid DNA in later lab sessions for DNA mutagenesis to create a Bcr-Abl mutant\nimplicated in Gleevec-resistant CML.\n\nToday you will use a Qiagen miniprep kit to isolate the plasmid DNA. The following\ninstructions are modified from the Qiagen miniprep handbook:\n\nMiniprep Procedure:\na.) Harvest the bacterial cells from your overnight cultures (12 mL total) by transferring\n1.5 mL of culture into each of four 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes and spinning down the cells\nin a microcentrifuge for 3 minutes. Discard the supernatant and add 1.5 mL of remaining\nculture to the four eppendorf tubes. Repeat the centrifugation and discard the supernatant.\nYou should have a small bacterial pellet at the bottom of each tube.\nb.) Check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. Add 250 μL of Buffer P1 to each\ncell pellet and completely resuspend each pellet by vortexing.\nc.) Add 250 μL of Buffer P2 to each tube, and mix by inverting the tubes 4-6 times. Do\nnot vortex, since that can cause shearing of the DNA. If you have properly lysed the cells,\nthe cell suspensions will turn blue after the addition of the P2 buffer. If there are colorless\nregions or brown clumps in the cells, continue mixing until a homogenous blue solution\nappears.\nd.) Add 350 μL of Buffer N3 to each tube and mix immediately by inverting the tubes 4-6\ntimes. The solutions should become colorless and cloudy.\n\ne.) Centrifuge the tubes for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in you bench top microcentrifuge. A\ncompact white pellet should form in each sample.\nf.) Apply the resulting supernatant from each tube (which contains the plasmid DNA) to\neach of four QIAprep spin columns by decanting or pipetting.\ng.) Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow through.\nh.) Wash the spin columns by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 s.\nDiscard the flow through.\ni.) Centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. This is essential for\nthe success of any future enzymatic reactions.\nj.) Place the QIAprep spin columns into clean and labeled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nTo elute DNA, add 40 μL of Buffer EB warmed to 55 °C (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.5) to the\ncenter of each spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.\n\nCombine the DNA elution samples (160 μL total) in an eppendorf tube. For long-term\nstorage, keep the purified DNA, labeled with your names and the date, at -20 °C.\n\n3.) Quantification of the DNA concentration by absorption at 260 nm\n\nDissolve x μL (suggested amount is 3 μL) of DNA sample in 100 μL of water. Measure\nthe absorbance at 260 nm in a quartz cuvette. See Section Appendix A2 for UV/Vis\nspectrophotometer instructions. To calculate the concentration in μg/μL of your double\nstranded DNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.05)(100/x). Typical concentrations of\nminiprepped DNA are 0.1-2 μg/μL.\n\nSESSION 2B (lab open 1-2 pm)\n\nPreparation and storage of the H396P Abl(229-511)/Yop- containing cell pellet.\na.) Remove the 1-L culture flask from the shaker and transfer the contents into a 500-mL\ncentrifuge tube.\n\nb.) Prior to spinning down the culture, transfer 1 mL from the centrifuge tube into a 1.5-\nmL eppendorf tube and spin it down for 3 minutes in a bench-top microcentrifuge.\nRemove the supernatant and store the tiny pellet at -20 °C. This is your post-induction\nsample for subsequent gel analysis.\n\nc.) Balance the mass of your centrifuge tube with a blank or with another group's tube. If\nneeded, use a transfer pipette to adjust the amount of culture in each tube or to add buffer.\n\nd.) Spin down the cell culture in the centrifuge at 6K rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Make\nsure the centrifuge is balanced, and, when possible, combine your centrifuge run with that\nof other groups to minimize wait time.\n\ne.) As the culture is spinning down, tare a 50-mL conical tube and record the weight on\nthe tube and in your notebook.\n\nf.) Once the centrifuge run is complete, decant the supernatant and carefully remove any\nresidual liquid with a transfer pipette. To discard, treat the supernatant with 50% bleach,\nand then pour it down the drain with plenty of water. The protein is in the pellet.\n\ng.) Carefully scrape the pellets into the tared 50-mL conical tube using a spatula.\n\nh.) If needed (if the pellet is not transferring well from the 500 to the 50-mL tube), add\nsome buffer to transfer any remaining pellet stuck in the 500-mL tube. Spin down the\npellet in the 50-mL conical tube for 5 minutes using the centrifuge tube adaptors and\nmaking sure your sample is balanced with a blank. Discard the supernatant.\n\ni.) Weigh the tube and record the pellet weight.\n\nj.) Store the H396P Abl(229-511)/Yop-containing cell pellet in the -20 °C freezer until\nneeded for protein purification. Please make sure to write your names and the date on\nyour tube!"

You will then design primers\nfor subsequent site-directed mutagenesis. In preparation for purifying the H396P Abl\nkinase domain, you will prepare all the necessary buffers for the lysis and purification. In\nsession 4, you will also prepare a standard curve for future protein quantification.\n\nRestriction enzymes (RE's) are enzymes that selectively cleave double stranded DNA\nbased on recognition of specific, short DNA sequences called recognition sites. In DNA\nengineering, restriction enzymes are used to cut open plasmids for the ligation of a\ncomplementarily-cut DNA insert into the plasmid for protein expression. In Session 2,\nyou isolated a DNA plasmid (the pET-28a vector) containing an insert encoding residues\n229-511 of the Abl kinase domain. Since the gene encoding the Abl kinase domain is\npositioned in the pET-28a vector between Xho1 and an Nde1 recognition sites, treatment\nof the plasmid with those two restriction enzymes should result in excision of the ABL\ninsert. Today you will excise the insert by digestion of the isolated plamid DNA with\nXho1 and Nde and check the size of the digestion products on an agarose gel to confirm\nthat your vector and insert are the expected size in base pairs (bp). As denoted in the\nvector map, the pET28a vector (minus the segment between the Nde1 and Xho1 sites) is\n5,289 bp, and the ABL insert should be 849 bp. As experimental controls, you will\nsimultaneously prepare a no-enzyme \"mock\" digest and digests containing only one of\nthe two restriction enzymes required to excise the ABL insert. By gel analysis of the four\nreactions, you will expect to see a band for the no-enzyme \"mock\" reaction at\napproximately 6,138 bp (consistent with the size of the insert plus vector. The one-\nenzyme reactions should linearize the plasmid DNA without excising any segment. Since\ncoiled plasmid DNA travels further by electrophoresis than equivalent linearized DNA,\nthese reactions should result in bands with an apparent size slightly larger than the uncut\nplasmid. A sample gel is provided below.\n\n2 3\nlane 1 500-bp DNA ladder\nlane 2 no-enzyme \"digestion\"\nlane 3 Xho1-only digestion\nlane 4 Nde1-only digestion\nlane 5 Xho1/Nde1 digestion\n500 bp\n1000 bp\n1500 bp\n2000 bp\n\n1.) DNA digestion with Xho1 and Nde1 restriction enzymes\n\nSet up analytical-scale digests of your plasmid DNA using 1 μg of DNA and final\nreaction volumes of 20 μL each. In each of four sterile 0.65 mL tubes, add the following\ncomponents in the order listed, where x = the volume of miniprep elution added (in μL)\nto give 1 μg of DNA:\n\nno enzyme\nXho1 only\nNde1 only\nXho1/Nde1\nSterile water\n\n17.8 - x μL\n17.3 - x μL\n17.3 - x μL\n16.8 - x μL\nRE 10X Buffer D\n\n2 μL\n\n2 μL\n\n2 μL\n\n2 μL\nBSA, 10 μg/ μL\n\n0.2 μL\n0.2 μL\n0.2 μL\n0.2 μL\nPlasmid DNA, 1 μg\n\nx μL\n\nx μL\n\nx μL\nx μL\nMix by pipetting, then add:\nXho1, 10 units/ μL\n\n0 μL\n\n0.5 μL\n0 μL\n\n0.5 μL\nNde1, 10 units/ μL\n\n0 μL\n\n0 μL\n\n0.5 μL\n0.5 μL\n\n______\n______\n______\n______\nFinal volume\n\n20 μL\n20 μL\n20 μL\n20 μL\n\nMix the reactions gently by pipetting, close the tubes, and centrifuge for several seconds\nin a bench-top microcentrifuge. Incubate the digestions for 1 hour in the 37 oC incubator.\nMeanwhile, prepare an agarose gel (described below) to analyze the digested DNA by\nelectrophoresis. When the digestions are complete, remove the tubes from the incubator\nand add 4 μL of 6X nucleic acid loading buffer to each of the reactions.\n\nDNA electrophoresis enables size-based DNA separation. Due to the negatively charged\nphosphate backbone of DNA, DNA molecules migrate from the negatively-charged to the\npositively-charged end of the gel. The smaller molecule travel faster than the larger\nmolecules. The size (in bp) of each separated DNA fragment is determined by\ncomparison to a DNA ladder that has a band at given intervals of bp. Here we will use a\n500 bp ladder that includes bands of DNA that are 500 bp, 1000 bp, 1500 bp, 2000 bp,\nand so on. Depending on the size of the DNA fragments you wish to analyze, more of\nless agarose can be incorporated into a DNA gel. The higher the percentage of agarose,\nthe smaller the effective range of separation will be. For analyzing the 849-bp insert and\nthe 6.1 kb Abl-containing vector, you will prepare a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel.\n\n2.) Preparation of a DNA 1.2 % agarose gel\n\nSet up the gel box as demonstrated by the TA. Insert the gel comb at the negatively-\ncharged (black) end of the box. In a 200-mL Erlenmeyer flask, weigh out 1.2 g agarose\nand add 100 mL of 1X Tris acetate electrophoresis (TAE) buffer. To prepare the 1X\nbuffer, dilute 10 mL of 10X TAE (provided by your TA) with 90 mL of DI water.\nDissolve the agarose by heating the flask in a microwave on medium heat until the\nsolution just boils. Prior to microwaving, plug the top of the flask with a paper towel to\nhelp prevent boiling over. All of the agarose solid should be dissolved and the solution\nshould be clear. Cool the solution to approximately 60 oC (cool enough to hold the flask\n\ncomfortably), and pour the solution into a prepared gel box. Allow the gel to set for\napproximately 30 minutes before loading. The colorless gel solution will have a bluish\ntint when the gel has solidified.\n\nOnce the gel has solidified, carefully remove the comb by pulling strait upwards.\nPour 1X TAE into the gel box so that it just covers the gel. Using a gel-loading tip that\nfits the 20-μL pipette, load 3 μL of 500-bp DNA ladder and 10 μL of each of your four\nDNA digestion samples. Remember, DNA will migrate toward the positive (red)\nelectrode. Loading the samples at the wrong end will cause the samples to run off the gel!\nPlace the top on the DNA gel box and run the gel at 100 Volts for 1 hour.\n\nOnce the gel running is complete, carefully remove the gel from the box and place\nit in a small plastic container, such as the top of a gel-tip box. Stain the gel with\napproximately 0.5 μg/ mL ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution for 10 minutes by agitating\non a gel rocker. EtBr is a fluorescent DNA intercalating agent, which means it inserts\nitself between DNA bases. Intercalated EtBr fluoresces under UV light with an intensity\nthat is approximately 20 fold brighter than EtBr that is not DNA-associated. This\nfluorescence increase results from the exclusion of water molecules (a common\nfluorescence quencher) associated with EtBr in solution. As an intercalating agent, it is\nnot surprising that EtBr is highly mutagenic and a suspected carcinogen and terratogen.\nWhile EtBr is less dangerous in solution than in the powder form, you should always\nwear nitrile gloves (not latex) and use extreme caution when handling any EtBr solution.\nAny gloves, paper towels, etc. that touch EtBr solutions should be discarded as solid EtBr\nhazardous waste.\n\nAfter incubation, dispose of the EtBr solution in the designated waste container.\nRinse the gel with water. Place the gel on the DNA transilluminator for visualization of\nyour bands, using appropriate UV shielding. Take a picture of your gel with the Polaroid\ncamera box for your lab report. Once you have a clear picture, discard the gel in the\ndesignated solid EtBr waste container.\n\nTo enable studies on additional point mutations found in the BCR-ABL gene of Gleevec-\nresistant cancer patients, you will introduce a point mutation in the wt DNA that you\nisolated and verified. Your resulting mutant DNA may be used in future iterations of the\ncourse for expression and use in kinase assays (as we are doing this year with the H396P\nmutant). Mutant DNA can be made from the wt DNA using site-directed mutagenesis.\nFrom the list of identified mutations in Appendix B3, select a mutant that interests you.\nWhile your DNA gel is running, you should begin designing primers to create the desired\nmutant DNA. Primer proposals should be written in the form of the proposal worksheet\nin Appendix C2 and turned in to your TA at the beginning of Session 4.\n\nOverview of DNA mutagenesis\n\nYou will use the QuikChange(r) (http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200518.pdf)\nsite-directed mutagenesis method to create your desired point mutation in the wt plasmid\nDNA that you have previously isolated by miniprep and analyzed by Xho1/Nde1\ndigestion. This mutagenesis method relies on a high-fidelity DNA polymerase and mutant\noligonucleotide primers, which you will design and that include the base pair substitution\nof interest. A DNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of\n\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n**\nGene in plasmid with\ntaget site for mutation\nDenature the plasmid and anneal\nthe oligonucleotide primers\ncontaining the desired mutation\nUsing the nonstrand-displacing\naction of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase,\nextend and incorporate the mutagenic\nprimers resulting in nicked circular strands\nDigest the methylated, nonmutated\nparental DNA template with Dpn I\nTransform the circular, nicked dsDNA\ninto DH5α chemically competent cells\nAfter transformation, the DH5α\ncells repair the nicks in the mutated\nplasmid\nStep 1\nPlasmid Preparation\nStep 2\nTemperature Cycling\nStep 3\nDigestion\nStep 4\nTransformation\nLEGEND\n*\n*\nmutagenic primer\nparental DNA plasmid\nmutated DNA plasmid\ntarget site for mutation\nmutagenic\nprimers\nmutated plamid\n(contains nicked\ncircular strands)\n\nFigure 1.

Specifically, the plasmid is denatured and the\nprimers containing the desired mutation are annealed to the complementary strand. The\npolymerase then uses the plasmid DNA as a template to extend the primers, resulting in a\nmutated plasmid with staggered nicks (breaks in the DNA where there are no connecting\nnucleotides against a strand of template DNA to make a new complimentary strand of\nDNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizes thermostable DNA polymerases,\nwhich enable the high temperature denaturation of DNA plamids to create single-\nstranded templates without simultaneously denaturing the polymerase enzyme. In the\nstandard mutagenesis procedure (Figure 1), the mutant primers are extended by the\nphosphodiester bond between nucleotides). In order to remove the wt template DNA\nfrom the PCR product mixture, the mixture is then treated with Dpn I endonuclease, an\nenzyme that specifically digests methylated and hemimethylated DNA. Since DNA\nisolated from most E. coli strands is methylated, treatment of the PCR product mixture\nwith Dpn 1 selectively digests the parent template DNA, leaving only mutant DNA\nassembled in vitro. The nicked vector DNA (containing the desired mutation) is then\ntransformed into DH5α cells. The cell machinery repairs the nicked DNA, and the\nrepaired mutant plasmid can be isolated by miniprep.\n\n3.) Design of forward and reverse mutant oligonucleotide primers\n\nYou will design two primers, each 25-45 nucleotides in length, which are the reverse\ncomplement (A to T and C to G) of each other and incorporate your desired mutation.\nThe following guidelines are from the Quikchange(r) instruction manual and should be\nadhered to exactly for successful mutagenesis.\n- The designed mutation should be in the middle of each primer with 10-15 bases of\ncorrect sequence on both sides.\n- Both mutagenic primers must contain the desired mutation and anneal to the same\nsequence on opposite strands of the plasmid.\n- Primers should be between 25 and 45 bases in length, with a melting temperature\n(Tm) greater than or equal to 78 oC. Use the formula below to estimate the Tm of\nyour proposed primers:\no Tm = 81.5 + 0.41(%GC) - 675/N - % mismatch\nwhere, N is the primer length in bases and the values for %GC and %\nmismatch are in whole numbers.\n- If possible, the primers should have a minimum GC content of 40% and should\nterminate in one or more C or G bases.\n- Primers must be purified by either fast polynucleotide liquid chromatography\n(FPLC) or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Failure to purify the\nprimers results in a significant decrease in mutation efficiency. This purification\ncan be performed by the primer synthesis facility and should be selected on the\norder form.\n\n(See section C1 of the appendix for an example of primer design)"

Preparation of Ni-affinity column buffers, dialysis stock buffer solution, and SDS-\nPAGE buffers: solutions for isolation and analysis of the H396P Abl kinase domain.\n\nThe Ni-NTA buffers and SDS-PAGE buffers will be shared by the class. Your TA will\ntherefore assign each group a total of three class buffers to prepare. Some of the buffer\npreparation protocols contain blanks, and for these you are must to calculate the required\namount of each reagent (in grams) to achieve the specified concentration.

Preparation of BSA solutions and creation of a standard curve for the Bio-Rad protein\nquantification assay. (This can be completed anytime before session 6. At a minimum, you\nshould prepare the 1 mg/mL BSA stock solution today.)\n\nPrepare 5 mL of a 1 mg/mL aqueous solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA). To do\nthis, weigh out 5 mg of BSA into a 15-mL conical tube on the balance. Add 5 mL of\nwater and invert or vortex the tube to completely dissolve the BSA. Divide the stock\nsolution into 1-mL aliquots in 1.5-ml eppedorf tubes and store at -20 °C for use in protein\nquantification assays throughout Modules 4 and 5. Prior to each assay, you must prepare\nfive dilutions of your BSA stock solution to create a standard curve. The linear range of\nthe Bio-Rad protein assay is 0.2 to 0.9 mg/mL. Therefore in six separate 0.65-mL\neppendorf tubes, label and add the following: 270 μL of the BSA stock and 30 μL of\ndeionized water (to give 0.9 mg/mL), 210 μL of BSA and 90 μL of water (to give 0.7\nmg/mL), 165 μL of BSA and 135 μL of water (to give 0.55 mg/mL), 120 μL of BSA and\n180 μL of water (to give 0.4 mg/mL), 60 μL of BSA and 240 μL of water (to give 0.2\nmg/mL), and no BSA and 300 uL of water (to use as your \"blank\").\n\nPrepare 20 mL of the assay dye reagent by diluting 1 part Bio-Rad dye\nconcentrate with 4 parts DI water. Filter the resulting solution and store any unused\nreagent for up to two weeks at room temperature. To create a standard curve using your\nBSA standards, pipette 20 μL of each standard into an eppendorf tube. Add 980 μL of the\nprepared dye reagent to each tube and vortex briefly. Incubate the tubes at room\ntemperature for 5 to 50 minutes. Measure the absorbance of each solution at 595 nm by\nUV/Vis spectrometry using disposable polystyrene cuvettes. See Appendix A2 for\ninstructions on using the Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer. The sample with 20 μL of\nwater in 980 μL of assay reagent should be used as your \"blank\" in the\nspectrophotometer. Plot the absorbance vs. concentration for the BSA standards using\n\nMicrosoft Excel or another graphing program and determine the R-squared value and\nslope of the best-fit line to establish that you can obtain a strait line with your standards.\nPrint a copy for your lab report. If your R-squared value is less than 0.9, repeat the\nexercise until you achieve an acceptable line. Good laboratory practice calls for the\ncreation of a new standard curve each time you run a protein assay.\n\n3.) Hand in the order form for your primers. See your TA about entering your primer\ninformation onto an Invitrogen order form."

This\nmeans that the kinase activity of c-Abl is tightly regulated, and the default activity setting\nis \"off\".\n\nA chromosomal abnormality implicated in chronic myleloid leukemia (CML)\ncauses the reciprocal translocation of genetic material from two different chromosomes, 9\nand 22, which results in the formation of a mutant gene that contains part of the BCR\n(break cluster region) gene from chromosome 22 and part of the ABL gene from\nchromosome 9. This mutant gene is called BCR-ABL, and the protein it encodes, denoted\nBcr-Abl, contains the kinase domain of c-Abl, but lacks the residues responsible for auto-\ninhibition. Bcr-Abl is therefore a constitutively active kinase, which means that the\nenzyme activity is permanently \"on\". This aberrant kinase activity is responsible for\nuncontrolled cell proliferation, which leads to cancer.\n\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nSH3\nSH2\ncap\nC-terminal\ndomains\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nSH3\nSH2\nC-terminal\ndomains\nBCR\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nc-Abl kinase (or Abl)\nThe activity of c-Abl is auto-inhibited by its\nN-terminal domains.

We will use it\nas a mimic of Bcr-Abl for our investigations. Like\nBcr-Abl, it is constitutively active.\nBCR\nAbl\nWe will abbreviate this below as\n\nA Small Molecule Drug for CML Treatment\n\nBcr-Abl activity is the underlying cause for CML, and the identification of the\nBcr-Abl oncoprotein led to high throughput screening and the \"rational design\" of\npotential small molecule inhibitors. These efforts culminated in the development of the\ndrug Gleevec by chemists at the pharmaceutical company Novartis (a branch of which is\na few doors down from us on Mass Ave). Gleevec (also known as Glivec, imatinib, and\nSTI-571) showed excellent efficacy against CML and was approved by the FDA in 2001.\nGleevec inhibits Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity by competitively binding in the ATP\nbinding pocket of the kinase domain and stabilizing the inactive conformation of the\nprotein. This development was particularly thrilling to the scientific community because\nGleevec is the first example of a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat human\ndisease. Also exciting is the striking specificity of Gleevec for Abl. Gleevec only inhibits\ntwo other proteins at physiological levels, neither of which result in problematic side\neffects.\n\nBcr\nAbl\nuncontrolled cell proliferation\n(cancer)\nACTIVE kinase\nBcr\nAbl\nACTIVE kinase\nBcr\nAbl\nINACTIVE kinase\nGleevec\nGleevec\nunc\n\nHowever....A PERCENTAGE OF CML PATIENTS DO NOT RESPOND TO\nGLEEVEC TREATMENT, AND OTHER PATIENTS THAT INITIALLY RESPOND\nTO TREATMENT EVENTUALLY DEVELOP GLEEVEC RESISTANCE.\nontrolled\nliferationX\ncell\npro\n(cancer)\n\nThe majority of these Gleevec-resistant cases can be linked to a single amino acid\nmutation in the Abl kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl protein.

The\nAbl kinase domain, similar to Bcr-Abl, lacks the N-terminal Abl regulation domains and\nis thus constitutively active. During this course you will express and purify an H396P\nmutant of the Abl kinase domain, a mutation that has been identified in patients with\nGleevec-resistent CML. You will use this mutant along with (commercially available)\nwild-type Abl kinase domain in a coupled phosphorylation assay to determine kinase\nactivity in the absence and presence of Gleevec and another kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib.\nIn addition, you will use site-directed mutagenesis to create a DNA expression vector for\nfuture expression of an another Gleevec-resistant Abl mutant of your choice.\nconstitutively active\nGleevec\nGleevec\nwild type\nInactive\nActive or Inactive?\nActive or Inactive?\nActive or Inactive?\nXXX\nXXX\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nconstitutively active\nwild type\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nconstitutively active\nAbl kinase\ndomain\n*H396P mutant\nconstitutively active\nAbl kinase\ndomain\n*H396P mutant\nBcr\nbl\nACTIVE kinase\nA\n*\nGleevec\nuncontrolled cell\nproliferation\n(cancer)\nBcr\nl\nACTIVE kinase\nAb\n*\nmutant\nGleevec\n\nModule 4 and 5 Overview: Gleevec is a blockbuster small molecule drug for chronic\nmyelogenous leukemia (CML) that functions as a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, an aberrant\nkinase implicated in the disease. While most of patients treated with Gleevec in the\nchronic stage of CML experience remission, a significant population eventually develops\nresistance to the drug. A number of point mutations in the gene that encodes the Bcr-Abl\nprotein have been identified in patients with Gleevec-resistant CML. Over the semester\nyou will develop and execute a research plan to 1) determine whether a selected mutation\n(H396P) in the BCR-ABL gene confers Gleevec resistance using an in-vitro kinase assay,\n2) explore the efficacy of an alternative Bcr-Abl inhibitor, Dasatinib, on the wild-type\nand mutant kinases, 3) evaluate crystal structures to understand the mechanism(s) by\nwhich Bcr-Abl mutations block drug activity, and 4) use site-directed mutagenesis to\ncreate an another Gleevec-resistant Abl mutant of your choice.

During laboratory Sessions 1\nand 2 you will express the H396P Abl kinase domain. You will also isolate wild type (wt)\nAbl plasmid DNA for subsequent mutagenesis.\n\n1) Preparation of LB media (the details in grey may be prepared by your TA)\nLB (Luria-Bertani) media must be prepared and sterilized for use in the bacterial growth\nand protein expression you will carry out in the next few sessions. The media should\ncontain a final concentration of 1% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract and 1.0% NaCl in\nwater. Using the premixed powder, add 25 g of LB powder/ L of water to achieve the\ndesired concentrations. Prepare a 500-mL solution of LB in a 1-L flask and a separate\n100-mL solution in a 200-mL container. For sterilization, cover the containers with\naluminum foil and make sure the cap is not screwed onto the 200-mL container. Stick a\npiece of autoclave indicator tape on the side of each flask. The tape will turn color upon\nreaching a sufficient sterilization temperature. Your TA will autoclave the media for 20\nmin. Once the sterilized LB media has cooled enough for you to hold the flask\ncomfortably, use sterile technique to add kanamycin (kan) and streptomycin (strep)\n(antibiotics) to a final concentration of 50 μg/mL each to the 500-mL solution. The TA's\nwill provide you with a 50 mg/ mL stock of strep and a 50 mg/ mL stock of kan, so you\nshould add 500 μL of strep and 500 μL of kan to the 500 mL of LB. Do not add\nantibiotics to the 200-mL bottle, and screw the cap on tightly once the solution has cooled\ncompletely.\n\nUsing sterile technique demonstrated by your TA, transfer two 6-mL and one 10-mL\naliquots of LB from the 200-mL bottle into three cell culture tubes. Tomorrow you will\ncheck to confirm that your tubes have remained clear, indicating that you have used good\nsterile technique. If your media becomes cloudy (other than after intentional inoculation),\nit means the solution has been contaminated, and you must prepare fresh media.\n\nSESSION 1B (lab open 1-2 pm)\n1) Inoculation of LB/ kan with E. coli containing a plasmid encoding the wt Abl kinase\ndomain\n\nConfirm that your LB media is contamination-free by checking that the solutions are\nclear. Add 6 μL of the kan 50 mg/mL stock solution to each of the culture tubes\ncontaining 6 mL of LB to give a final concentration of 50 μg/mL kan. Using a sterile\npipette tip, transfer half of a colony from a freshly-transformed bacterial plate (supplied\nby your TA) to a culture tube. You should drop the entire pipette tip into the solution.\nWith a second pipette tip, transfer the other half of the colony to the second tube. The\ncolonies on the plate are DH5-α E. coli cells, which are ideal bacterial storage cells to\nhold a vector of interest (in this case an Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid). Place the\nculture tubes in a 37 °C shaker overnight. In session 2 you will isolate the Abl kinase\ndomain plasmid DNA from the bacteria that grows up overnight.\n\n2) Inoculation of LB/ kan/ strep with E. coli containing plasmids encoding the H396P\nAbl kinase domain and the Yop phosphatase\n\nAdd 10 μL of the 50 mg/mL kan stock solution and 10 μL of the 50 mg/mL strep stock\nsolution to the culture tube containing 10 mL of LB to give a final concentration of 50\nμg/mL of each antibiotic. Using a sterile pipet tip, transfer a colony of H396P Abl(229-\n511)/ Yop-containing bacteria from a plate (supplied by your TA) to the culture tube. The\ncolonies on the plate are called BL21-DE3 cells, which are a cell-line commonly used for\nprotein expression. Place the culture tube in a 37 °C shaker overnight. In session 2 you\nwill use this \"starter culture\" to inoculate your 500-mL LB solution to express the H396P\nAbl(229-511) and Yop proteins.\n\nSESSION 2 (lab open 1-5 pm)\n\n1.) Expression of the H396P Abl kinase domain in the presence of Yop phosphatase\n\nInoculate 500 mL of LB/ kan/ strep with your 10-mL starter culture of bacteria containing\nthe ABL and YOP genes. Place the flask in the 37 °C shaker and periodically check the\nOD600 (optical density or absorbance at 600 nm) using the UV/Vis spectrometer. Use\n(non-inoculated) LB as the sample blank. Review the spectrometer instructions in\nAppendix A2. Once the OD600 reaches 0.1, the density should double approximately\nevery 20 minutes, which should help you plan when next to check the OD. When the\nmedia reaches an OD600 of 0.8 to 1.0, remove the flask from the 37 °C shaker and place\nit in the 24 °C shaker. At this point, transfer 1 mL of the culture to a 1.5-mL eppendorf\ntube and spin it down for 3 minutes in a bench top microcentrifuge. Remove the\nsupernatant and store the pellet at -20 °C. This is your pre-induction sample for\nsubsequent gel analysis. After the cell culture has been shaking at 24 °C for at least 10\nminutes (or up to one hour), induce protein expression with the addition of IPTG. Add\n100 μL of 1M IPTG to give a final concentration of 0.2 mM IPTG. Let the culture grow\nat 24 °C overnight.\n\n2.) Isolation of the wt Abl plasmid DNA from the two 6-mL overnight cultures.\n\nWhile you monitor the OD of your H396P Abl(229-511)/ Yop expression, you should\nconcurrently work to isolate the plasmid DNA from your two 6-mL overnight bacterial\ncultures, which contain the wt Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid. You will use the isolated\nplasmid DNA in later lab sessions for DNA mutagenesis to create a Bcr-Abl mutant\nimplicated in Gleevec-resistant CML.\n\nToday you will use a Qiagen miniprep kit to isolate the plasmid DNA. The following\ninstructions are modified from the Qiagen miniprep handbook:\n\nMiniprep Procedure:\na.) Harvest the bacterial cells from your overnight cultures (12 mL total) by transferring\n1.5 mL of culture into each of four 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes and spinning down the cells\nin a microcentrifuge for 3 minutes. Discard the supernatant and add 1.5 mL of remaining\nculture to the four eppendorf tubes. Repeat the centrifugation and discard the supernatant.\nYou should have a small bacterial pellet at the bottom of each tube.\nb.) Check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. Add 250 μL of Buffer P1 to each\ncell pellet and completely resuspend each pellet by vortexing.\nc.) Add 250 μL of Buffer P2 to each tube, and mix by inverting the tubes 4-6 times. Do\nnot vortex, since that can cause shearing of the DNA. If you have properly lysed the cells,\nthe cell suspensions will turn blue after the addition of the P2 buffer. If there are colorless\nregions or brown clumps in the cells, continue mixing until a homogenous blue solution\nappears.\nd.) Add 350 μL of Buffer N3 to each tube and mix immediately by inverting the tubes 4-6\ntimes. The solutions should become colorless and cloudy.\n\ne.) Centrifuge the tubes for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in you bench top microcentrifuge. A\ncompact white pellet should form in each sample.\nf.) Apply the resulting supernatant from each tube (which contains the plasmid DNA) to\neach of four QIAprep spin columns by decanting or pipetting.\ng.) Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow through.\nh.) Wash the spin columns by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 s.\nDiscard the flow through.\ni.) Centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. This is essential for\nthe success of any future enzymatic reactions.\nj.) Place the QIAprep spin columns into clean and labeled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nTo elute DNA, add 40 μL of Buffer EB warmed to 55 °C (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.5) to the\ncenter of each spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.\n\nCombine the DNA elution samples (160 μL total) in an eppendorf tube. For long-term\nstorage, keep the purified DNA, labeled with your names and the date, at -20 °C.\n\n3.) Quantification of the DNA concentration by absorption at 260 nm\n\nDissolve x μL (suggested amount is 3 μL) of DNA sample in 100 μL of water. Measure\nthe absorbance at 260 nm in a quartz cuvette. See Section Appendix A2 for UV/Vis\nspectrophotometer instructions. To calculate the concentration in μg/μL of your double\nstranded DNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.05)(100/x). Typical concentrations of\nminiprepped DNA are 0.1-2 μg/μL.\n\nSESSION 2B (lab open 1-2 pm)\n\nPreparation and storage of the H396P Abl(229-511)/Yop- containing cell pellet.\na.) Remove the 1-L culture flask from the shaker and transfer the contents into a 500-mL\ncentrifuge tube.\n\nb.) Prior to spinning down the culture, transfer 1 mL from the centrifuge tube into a 1.5-\nmL eppendorf tube and spin it down for 3 minutes in a bench-top microcentrifuge.\nRemove the supernatant and store the tiny pellet at -20 °C. This is your post-induction\nsample for subsequent gel analysis.\n\nc.) Balance the mass of your centrifuge tube with a blank or with another group's tube. If\nneeded, use a transfer pipette to adjust the amount of culture in each tube or to add buffer.\n\nd.) Spin down the cell culture in the centrifuge at 6K rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Make\nsure the centrifuge is balanced, and, when possible, combine your centrifuge run with that\nof other groups to minimize wait time.\n\ne.) As the culture is spinning down, tare a 50-mL conical tube and record the weight on\nthe tube and in your notebook.\n\nf.) Once the centrifuge run is complete, decant the supernatant and carefully remove any\nresidual liquid with a transfer pipette. To discard, treat the supernatant with 50% bleach,\nand then pour it down the drain with plenty of water. The protein is in the pellet.\n\ng.) Carefully scrape the pellets into the tared 50-mL conical tube using a spatula.\n\nh.) If needed (if the pellet is not transferring well from the 500 to the 50-mL tube), add\nsome buffer to transfer any remaining pellet stuck in the 500-mL tube. Spin down the\npellet in the 50-mL conical tube for 5 minutes using the centrifuge tube adaptors and\nmaking sure your sample is balanced with a blank. Discard the supernatant.\n\ni.) Weigh the tube and record the pellet weight.\n\nj.) Store the H396P Abl(229-511)/Yop-containing cell pellet in the -20 °C freezer until\nneeded for protein purification. Please make sure to write your names and the date on\nyour tube!\n\nSESSION 3 (lab open 1-5 pm)\n\nDuring sessions 3 and 4 you will verify that the plasmid DNA you isolated contains a\nconstruct of the expected size for the Abl kinase domain. You will then design primers\nfor subsequent site-directed mutagenesis. In preparation for purifying the H396P Abl\nkinase domain, you will prepare all the necessary buffers for the lysis and purification. In\nsession 4, you will also prepare a standard curve for future protein quantification.\n\nRestriction enzymes (RE's) are enzymes that selectively cleave double stranded DNA\nbased on recognition of specific, short DNA sequences called recognition sites. In DNA\nengineering, restriction enzymes are used to cut open plasmids for the ligation of a\ncomplementarily-cut DNA insert into the plasmid for protein expression. In Session 2,\nyou isolated a DNA plasmid (the pET-28a vector) containing an insert encoding residues\n229-511 of the Abl kinase domain. Since the gene encoding the Abl kinase domain is\npositioned in the pET-28a vector between Xho1 and an Nde1 recognition sites, treatment\nof the plasmid with those two restriction enzymes should result in excision of the ABL\ninsert. Today you will excise the insert by digestion of the isolated plamid DNA with\nXho1 and Nde and check the size of the digestion products on an agarose gel to confirm\nthat your vector and insert are the expected size in base pairs (bp). As denoted in the\nvector map, the pET28a vector (minus the segment between the Nde1 and Xho1 sites) is\n5,289 bp, and the ABL insert should be 849 bp. As experimental controls, you will\nsimultaneously prepare a no-enzyme \"mock\" digest and digests containing only one of\nthe two restriction enzymes required to excise the ABL insert. By gel analysis of the four\nreactions, you will expect to see a band for the no-enzyme \"mock\" reaction at\napproximately 6,138 bp (consistent with the size of the insert plus vector. The one-\nenzyme reactions should linearize the plasmid DNA without excising any segment. Since\ncoiled plasmid DNA travels further by electrophoresis than equivalent linearized DNA,\nthese reactions should result in bands with an apparent size slightly larger than the uncut\nplasmid.

Incubate the digestions for 1 hour in the 37 oC incubator.\nMeanwhile, prepare an agarose gel (described below) to analyze the digested DNA by\nelectrophoresis. When the digestions are complete, remove the tubes from the incubator\nand add 4 μL of 6X nucleic acid loading buffer to each of the reactions.\n\nDNA electrophoresis enables size-based DNA separation. Due to the negatively charged\nphosphate backbone of DNA, DNA molecules migrate from the negatively-charged to the\npositively-charged end of the gel. The smaller molecule travel faster than the larger\nmolecules. The size (in bp) of each separated DNA fragment is determined by\ncomparison to a DNA ladder that has a band at given intervals of bp. Here we will use a\n500 bp ladder that includes bands of DNA that are 500 bp, 1000 bp, 1500 bp, 2000 bp,\nand so on. Depending on the size of the DNA fragments you wish to analyze, more of\nless agarose can be incorporated into a DNA gel. The higher the percentage of agarose,\nthe smaller the effective range of separation will be. For analyzing the 849-bp insert and\nthe 6.1 kb Abl-containing vector, you will prepare a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel.\n\n2.) Preparation of a DNA 1.2 % agarose gel\n\nSet up the gel box as demonstrated by the TA. Insert the gel comb at the negatively-\ncharged (black) end of the box. In a 200-mL Erlenmeyer flask, weigh out 1.2 g agarose\nand add 100 mL of 1X Tris acetate electrophoresis (TAE) buffer. To prepare the 1X\nbuffer, dilute 10 mL of 10X TAE (provided by your TA) with 90 mL of DI water.\nDissolve the agarose by heating the flask in a microwave on medium heat until the\nsolution just boils. Prior to microwaving, plug the top of the flask with a paper towel to\nhelp prevent boiling over. All of the agarose solid should be dissolved and the solution\nshould be clear. Cool the solution to approximately 60 oC (cool enough to hold the flask\n\ncomfortably), and pour the solution into a prepared gel box. Allow the gel to set for\napproximately 30 minutes before loading. The colorless gel solution will have a bluish\ntint when the gel has solidified.\n\nOnce the gel has solidified, carefully remove the comb by pulling strait upwards.\nPour 1X TAE into the gel box so that it just covers the gel. Using a gel-loading tip that\nfits the 20-μL pipette, load 3 μL of 500-bp DNA ladder and 10 μL of each of your four\nDNA digestion samples. Remember, DNA will migrate toward the positive (red)\nelectrode. Loading the samples at the wrong end will cause the samples to run off the gel!\nPlace the top on the DNA gel box and run the gel at 100 Volts for 1 hour.\n\nOnce the gel running is complete, carefully remove the gel from the box and place\nit in a small plastic container, such as the top of a gel-tip box. Stain the gel with\napproximately 0.5 μg/ mL ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution for 10 minutes by agitating\non a gel rocker. EtBr is a fluorescent DNA intercalating agent, which means it inserts\nitself between DNA bases. Intercalated EtBr fluoresces under UV light with an intensity\nthat is approximately 20 fold brighter than EtBr that is not DNA-associated. This\nfluorescence increase results from the exclusion of water molecules (a common\nfluorescence quencher) associated with EtBr in solution. As an intercalating agent, it is\nnot surprising that EtBr is highly mutagenic and a suspected carcinogen and terratogen.\nWhile EtBr is less dangerous in solution than in the powder form, you should always\nwear nitrile gloves (not latex) and use extreme caution when handling any EtBr solution.\nAny gloves, paper towels, etc. that touch EtBr solutions should be discarded as solid EtBr\nhazardous waste.\n\nAfter incubation, dispose of the EtBr solution in the designated waste container.\nRinse the gel with water. Place the gel on the DNA transilluminator for visualization of\nyour bands, using appropriate UV shielding. Take a picture of your gel with the Polaroid\ncamera box for your lab report. Once you have a clear picture, discard the gel in the\ndesignated solid EtBr waste container.\n\nTo enable studies on additional point mutations found in the BCR-ABL gene of Gleevec-\nresistant cancer patients, you will introduce a point mutation in the wt DNA that you\nisolated and verified. Your resulting mutant DNA may be used in future iterations of the\ncourse for expression and use in kinase assays (as we are doing this year with the H396P\nmutant). Mutant DNA can be made from the wt DNA using site-directed mutagenesis.\nFrom the list of identified mutations in Appendix B3, select a mutant that interests you.\nWhile your DNA gel is running, you should begin designing primers to create the desired\nmutant DNA. Primer proposals should be written in the form of the proposal worksheet\nin Appendix C2 and turned in to your TA at the beginning of Session 4.\n\nOverview of DNA mutagenesis\n\nYou will use the QuikChange(r) (http://www.stratagene.com/manuals/200518.pdf)\nsite-directed mutagenesis method to create your desired point mutation in the wt plasmid\nDNA that you have previously isolated by miniprep and analyzed by Xho1/Nde1\ndigestion. This mutagenesis method relies on a high-fidelity DNA polymerase and mutant\noligonucleotide primers, which you will design and that include the base pair substitution\nof interest. A DNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of\n\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n**\nGene in plasmid with\ntaget site for mutation\nDenature the plasmid and anneal\nthe oligonucleotide primers\ncontaining the desired mutation\nUsing the nonstrand-displacing\naction of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase,\nextend and incorporate the mutagenic\nprimers resulting in nicked circular strands\nDigest the methylated, nonmutated\nparental DNA template with Dpn I\nTransform the circular, nicked dsDNA\ninto DH5α chemically competent cells\nAfter transformation, the DH5α\ncells repair the nicks in the mutated\nplasmid\nStep 1\nPlasmid Preparation\nStep 2\nTemperature Cycling\nStep 3\nDigestion\nStep 4\nTransformation\nLEGEND\n*\n*\nmutagenic primer\nparental DNA plasmid\nmutated DNA plasmid\ntarget site for mutation\nmutagenic\nprimers\nmutated plamid\n(contains nicked\ncircular strands)\n\nFigure 1.

Specifically, the plasmid is denatured and the\nprimers containing the desired mutation are annealed to the complementary strand. The\npolymerase then uses the plasmid DNA as a template to extend the primers, resulting in a\nmutated plasmid with staggered nicks (breaks in the DNA where there are no connecting\nnucleotides against a strand of template DNA to make a new complimentary strand of\nDNA. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizes thermostable DNA polymerases,\nwhich enable the high temperature denaturation of DNA plamids to create single-\nstranded templates without simultaneously denaturing the polymerase enzyme. In the\nstandard mutagenesis procedure (Figure 1), the mutant primers are extended by the\nphosphodiester bond between nucleotides). In order to remove the wt template DNA\nfrom the PCR product mixture, the mixture is then treated with Dpn I endonuclease, an\nenzyme that specifically digests methylated and hemimethylated DNA. Since DNA\nisolated from most E. coli strands is methylated, treatment of the PCR product mixture\nwith Dpn 1 selectively digests the parent template DNA, leaving only mutant DNA\nassembled in vitro. The nicked vector DNA (containing the desired mutation) is then\ntransformed into DH5α cells. The cell machinery repairs the nicked DNA, and the\nrepaired mutant plasmid can be isolated by miniprep.\n\n3.) Design of forward and reverse mutant oligonucleotide primers\n\nYou will design two primers, each 25-45 nucleotides in length, which are the reverse\ncomplement (A to T and C to G) of each other and incorporate your desired mutation.\nThe following guidelines are from the Quikchange(r) instruction manual and should be\nadhered to exactly for successful mutagenesis.\n- The designed mutation should be in the middle of each primer with 10-15 bases of\ncorrect sequence on both sides.\n- Both mutagenic primers must contain the desired mutation and anneal to the same\nsequence on opposite strands of the plasmid.\n- Primers should be between 25 and 45 bases in length, with a melting temperature\n(Tm) greater than or equal to 78 oC. Use the formula below to estimate the Tm of\nyour proposed primers:\no Tm = 81.5 + 0.41(%GC) - 675/N - % mismatch\nwhere, N is the primer length in bases and the values for %GC and %\nmismatch are in whole numbers.\n- If possible, the primers should have a minimum GC content of 40% and should\nterminate in one or more C or G bases.\n- Primers must be purified by either fast polynucleotide liquid chromatography\n(FPLC) or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Failure to purify the\nprimers results in a significant decrease in mutation efficiency. This purification\ncan be performed by the primer synthesis facility and should be selected on the\norder form.\n\n(See section C1 of the appendix for an example of primer design)\n\nSESSION 4\n\nLaboratory Procedures (lab open 1-5 pm)\n\n1.) Preparation of Ni-affinity column buffers, dialysis stock buffer solution, and SDS-\nPAGE buffers: solutions for isolation and analysis of the H396P Abl kinase domain.\n\nThe Ni-NTA buffers and SDS-PAGE buffers will be shared by the class. Your TA will\ntherefore assign each group a total of three class buffers to prepare. Some of the buffer\npreparation protocols contain blanks, and for these you are must to calculate the required\namount of each reagent (in grams) to achieve the specified concentration. CONFIRM\nTHAT YOUR CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT WITH YOUR TA BEFORE YOU\nSTART TO PREPARE YOUR BUFFERS.\n\nYour TA will assign you to prepare one of the three Ni-NTA purification buffers\ndescribed below:\n\na) Ni-NTA binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.8). In a 1 L bottle,\ncombine _______ g of Tris base (FW 121.1), _______ g NaCl (FW 58.44),\nand 800 mL of cold water. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the\nfinal volume to 1L.\nb) Ni-NTA washing buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, pH\n7.8). In a 500 mL or 1L bottle, combine _______ g Tris base (FW 121.1),\n_______ g NaCl (FW 58.44), _______ g imidazole (FW 68.08), and 400 mL\nof water. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to\n500 mL.\nc) Ni-NTA elution buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, pH\n7.8). In a 500 mL or 1L bottle, combine _______ g Tris base (FW 121.1),\n_______ g NaCl (FW 58.44), _______ g imidazole (FW 68.08), and 400 mL\nof water. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to\n500 mL.\n\nEACH group must prepare a 10X stock of TBS for dialysis as indicated:\n\nd) 10X TBS (dialysis buffer) (200 mM Tris, 1.37 M NaCl, pH 7.5). In a 1 L\nbottle, combine _______ g Tris base, _______ g NaCl, and 800 mL of water.\nAdjust the pH to 7.5 with HCl, and then adjust the final volume to 1 L.\n\nYou will be assigned two of the SDS-PAGE gel buffers below to prepare for the class to\nshare. Several of the buffers will be prepared by the TAs, as indicated:\n\ne) 10X electrophoresis buffer (Tank buffer). In a 2 L bottle, combine 60.4 g Tris\nbase, 288 g glycine, and 10 g SDS. Add water to a final volume of 2 L.\nf)\nCoomasie staining solution (provided by TA). 0.25 % Coomassie Brilliant\nBlue, 50 % methanol, and 10 % glacial acetic acid.\n\ng) 6X reducing protein loading buffer. For 15 mL of solution, combine 3.5 mL\nwater, 3.5 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.6 mL glycerol (use a positive\ndisplacement pipette for this viscous liquid), 1.0 g SDS, 930 mg DTT, and\n1.2 mg bromophenol blue. Store this solution at - 20 oC.\nh) Fast destain solution (provided by TA). 40% methanol and 10% glacial\nacetic acid.

Add water to a final volume of 1\nL.\nl)\n50 % sucrose, 100 mL\nm) 10 % ammonium persulfate (APS), 10 mL. store at 4 °C.\nn) 40% acrylamide/ bisacrylamide solution (provided by TA)\n\n2.) Preparation of BSA solutions and creation of a standard curve for the Bio-Rad protein\nquantification assay. (This can be completed anytime before session 6. At a minimum, you\nshould prepare the 1 mg/mL BSA stock solution today.)\n\nPrepare 5 mL of a 1 mg/mL aqueous solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA). To do\nthis, weigh out 5 mg of BSA into a 15-mL conical tube on the balance. Add 5 mL of\nwater and invert or vortex the tube to completely dissolve the BSA. Divide the stock\nsolution into 1-mL aliquots in 1.5-ml eppedorf tubes and store at -20 °C for use in protein\nquantification assays throughout Modules 4 and 5. Prior to each assay, you must prepare\nfive dilutions of your BSA stock solution to create a standard curve. The linear range of\nthe Bio-Rad protein assay is 0.2 to 0.9 mg/mL. Therefore in six separate 0.65-mL\neppendorf tubes, label and add the following: 270 μL of the BSA stock and 30 μL of\ndeionized water (to give 0.9 mg/mL), 210 μL of BSA and 90 μL of water (to give 0.7\nmg/mL), 165 μL of BSA and 135 μL of water (to give 0.55 mg/mL), 120 μL of BSA and\n180 μL of water (to give 0.4 mg/mL), 60 μL of BSA and 240 μL of water (to give 0.2\nmg/mL), and no BSA and 300 uL of water (to use as your \"blank\").\n\nPrepare 20 mL of the assay dye reagent by diluting 1 part Bio-Rad dye\nconcentrate with 4 parts DI water. Filter the resulting solution and store any unused\nreagent for up to two weeks at room temperature. To create a standard curve using your\nBSA standards, pipette 20 μL of each standard into an eppendorf tube. Add 980 μL of the\nprepared dye reagent to each tube and vortex briefly. Incubate the tubes at room\ntemperature for 5 to 50 minutes. Measure the absorbance of each solution at 595 nm by\nUV/Vis spectrometry using disposable polystyrene cuvettes. See Appendix A2 for\ninstructions on using the Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer. The sample with 20 μL of\nwater in 980 μL of assay reagent should be used as your \"blank\" in the\nspectrophotometer. Plot the absorbance vs. concentration for the BSA standards using\n\nMicrosoft Excel or another graphing program and determine the R-squared value and\nslope of the best-fit line to establish that you can obtain a strait line with your standards.\nPrint a copy for your lab report. If your R-squared value is less than 0.9, repeat the\nexercise until you achieve an acceptable line. Good laboratory practice calls for the\ncreation of a new standard curve each time you run a protein assay.\n\n3.) Hand in the order form for your primers. See your TA about entering your primer\ninformation onto an Invitrogen order form.\n\nSESSION 5 (lab open 1-5 pm)\n\nWhile we wait for the DNA primers to arrive for the mutagenesis, we will focus on\npurifying the H396P Abl kinase domain. Today you will lyse your H396P Abl(229-511)/\nYop-containing pellet, and isolate the H396P Abl kinase domain via its amino-terminal\nhexahistidine tag.\n\nAffinity tag purification of recombinant proteins:\n\nA common strategy for isolating a recombinant protein from cell lysate is the use\nof an affinity tag, which is a small peptide or protein fragment that can reversibly bind to\na specifically-functionalized solid support. In affinity-based purification, the protein of\ninterest is expressed with a tag immediately amino-terminal or carboxy-terminal to the\nprotein. After cell lysis, the tagged protein is pulled out of the crude lysate through the\nbinding of the tag to affinity resin. The resin is copiously washed to remove any non-\nspecific binders, and the protein of interest is then eluted from the column by changing\nthe pH to reduce binding affinity or by introducing a competitive binder. Common\naffinity tags include the GST tag (a 27-kDa protein that binds glutathione coated beads),\nthe FLAG tag (an 8-residue peptide, DYKDDDDK, that binds a FLAG-antibody\nfunctionalized resin), and the hexahistidine tag (HHHHHH, which binds to Ni/NTA\nfunctionalized resin). Here we will utilize the hexahistidine tag appended to the amino-\nterminus of the Abl kinase domain. Since no other proteins in the bacteria have this tag,\nyou should be able to selectively isolate the hexahistidine-tagged H396P Abl(229-511)\nprotein. Elution of the target protein is accomplished by the addition of 100 to 200 mM\nimidazole, which competes for the Ni binding. The structure of imidazole and histidine\nare shown in Fig. 2 to demonstrate their identical Ni-coordination sites. In addition to\npurification applications, affinity tags can also be used for protein visualization on gels.\nFor example, an anti-hexahistine antibody conjugated with a fluorescent marker can be\nused to visualize which bands on a gel contain the hexahistidine tag.\n\nNH\nN\nN\nH\nN\nHistidine\nImidazole\n\nFigure 2. Structures of histidine and imidazole\n\nLaboratory\n\n1.) Cell lysis\nI. Thaw the cell pellet on ice or at room temperature.\nII. Add 10 mL of B-PER detergent and 100 μL of a 100X protease inhibitor cocktail\nsolution to the pellet in a 50-mL conical tube. Pipette up and down using a 10-mL\npipette until the cell suspension is homogenous. In order to maximize your protein\nyield, it is essential that the suspension is free of lumps and completely\nhomogenous before moving on to the next step. This may mean pipetting up and\ndown 40 or more times.\n\nIII. Add an additional 10 mL of B-PER and 100 μL of 100X protease inhibitor\ncocktail and pipette up and down 10 to 15 times to achieve a homogenous\nsuspension.\nIV. Gently agitate (by shaking or rocking) the suspension for 10 min at 4 oC.\nV. Centrifuge the tube at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Remember to balance the\ncentrifuge with a tube of equal mass, such as another group's cell lysis mixture.\nVI. Decant the solution (containing your soluble protein) into a fresh 50-mL conical\ntube. Add Ni-NTA binding buffer to a final volume of approximately 46 mL and\nimmediately continue on to the Ni-NTA purification. If necessary, you can store\nthe lysate on ice if you are waiting for Ni-NTA resin.\nVII. To discard of the cell pellet, add 30% bleach to the pellet in the conical tube. Let\nthe pellet sit in the bleach solution for at least 30 min, then dispose of the pellet\nand solution down the drain using plenty of water.\n\n2.) Purification of the H396P Abl kinase domain by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography\n\nWhile the purification will be carried out at room temperature on the benchtop, all buffers\nshould be stored at 4 oC and all elutions should be stored in an ice bucket.\n\nI. To your solution of crude peptide in binding buffer, add a total of 1 mL Ni-NTA\npre-activated resin. Note: 1 mL of resin is equivalent to 2 mL of a 50% resin\nslurry. The slurry can be transferred directly from the resin bottle to your 50-mL\nconical tube using a pipette.\nII. Gently agitate the resin with your protein solution for 20 min at 4 °C.\nIII. Carefully add the cell lysate/resin mixture to a 20-mL plastic column, and collect\nthe flow through in a 50-mL conical tube. It is very important that you never\nallow the resin to go dry! Make sure that there is always at least a small amount\nof buffer above the resin bed.\nIV. Once the cell lysate reaches the level of the filled resin, wash the resin with 10\nmL of binding buffer and then with 30 mL of washing buffer. Collect the flow\nthrough in a 50 mL conical tube.\nV. Elute the hexahistidine-tagged Abl protein from the column by adding 1.2-mL\naliquots of elution buffer. Collect each 1.2-mL aliquot in a separate, labeled 1.5-\nmL eppendorf tube. Collect 7 elution fractions in total. Fractions containing your\nprotein may be light blue from Ni that has eluted with the protein.\nVI. For subsequent gel analysis (in session 7) remove a 40-uL aliquot from each\nelution fraction. Carefully label these and store at 4 oC.\nVII. Combine your elution fractions and dialyze the protein into TBS as described (in\nsection 4.)) below.\nVIII. Wash the column with 10 mL of washing buffer, and deposit your used resin in\nthe designated container for regeneration.\n\n3.) Optional: Absorption measurements of Ni/NTA elution fractions\nMeasure the A280 of all fractions. See Appendix A2 for spectrophotometer\ninstructions. Absorption at 280 is a less sensitive detection method than visualization on\nan SDS-PAGE gel, so you may find that fractions with no detectible protein by UV/Vis\n\nhave protein present on a gel. In your lab report, you should compare the results for\ndetection by absorption at 280 nm with those for SDS-PAGE gel analysis.\n\n4.) Dialysis of the purified H396P Abl(229-511) protein\n\nSince the activity of some proteins can be damaged by prolonged storage in buffers with\nhigh concentration of imidazole, you will dialyze your eluted H396P Abl(229-511)\nfractions into TBS buffer. Consider the sizes (molecular weights) of the components in\nyou elutions: the hexahistidine tagged Abl kinase domain is approximately 32 kDa, and\nthe imidazole is 68 Da (0.068 kDa). Therefore using a 10 kDa MWCO (molecular weight\ncut off) dialysis device should easily enable removal of imidazole from the protein\nsolution.\n\nBased on the Ni-NTA elutions that contain detectable protein by absorption at 280 nm,\ncombine all elutions with a significant concentration of the Abl domain. (Alternatively,\nyou can combine all 7 elution fractions if you did not measure the A280 values.) Soak a\n10-kDa MWCO dialysis cassette in 1X TBS or water for at least ten minutes. Using a\nsyringe, carefully load the protein solution into the dialysis cassette. Be careful not to\npierce through the side of the cassette. Please have your TA observe you during this\nstep to ensure the correct protocol is being followed and that no protein is lost.\nUsing the Styrofoam floatation clips, float the cassette in 2 L of cold TBS. Dialyze your\nprotein at 4 °C overnight. In preparation for buffer exchange, chill another 2 L of TBS at\n4 °C overnight. Tomorrow you will exchange the dialysis buffer with the fresh pre-\nchilled TBS.\n\nSESSION 5B (lab open 1-2 pm)\n\nExchange the dialysis buffer with fresh pre-chilled TBS, and continue dialysis at 4 °C.\nThe used TBS can be poured down the drain to dispose.\n\nSESSION 6 (lab open 1-5 pm)\n\n1.) Preparation of an SDS page gel\n\nSDS-PAGE gel analysis will allow you to check the identity (by molecular\nweight) and purity of the H396P Abl kinase domain. In an SDS gel, proteins are\nseparated based on their molecular weights. This occurs because the SDS (a detergent)\nbinds to all denatured proteins in an amount approximately proportional to the size of the\nprotein. This results in all proteins having an equal charge to mass ratios, since the\nnegatively-charged SDS masks any charges from the protein side chains. The protein size\nis thus the sole factor that affects its migration speed through the pores of the\npolymerized gel. The molecular weight of each protein can be deduced by comparing the\nmigration distance of the protein bands to that of a protein ladder, which is comprised of\nprotein samples with known molecular weights.\n\nAssembly of your SDS-PAGE gel\n\nI. Make up the 12 % running gel. In a 15-mL conical tube, combine 3 mL 40%\nacrylamide/ bisacrylamide solution, 2.4 mL 1.0 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1.2 mL 50%\nsucrose, 3 mL water, and 100 μL 10% SDS. Wait until a TA is by your side and\nwatching before you add the APS or TEMED. Once you are ready to pour the gel\nand your TA is watching you, add 250 μL of 10% APS solution and 2.5 μL of\nTEMED.\nII. Mix the solution by inverting 4-6 times, and then immediately transfer enough\nsolution to fill the gel cassette part way using a Pasteur pipette. Your TA will\ndemonstrate how high the running gel should be to leave sufficient room for the\nstacking gel and the gel comb. Once the gel is poured, add a thin layer of water to the\ntop of the running gel to keep the top level.\nIII. Allow the gel to polymerize, which can take up to 30 minutes. While the gel\npolymerizes, you can prepare the stacking solution (step IV) minus the APS and\nTEMED, which should not be added until just before the stacking gel is poured. Once\nthe running gel has solidified, decant the water layer and use filter paper to absorb\nany residual water.\nIV. Pour the stacking gel. In a 15 mL conical tube, combine 500 μL 40% acrylamide/\nbisacrylamide solution, 1.7 mL 0.38 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.5 mL water, and 50 μL\n10% SDS. Next add 400 μL 10% APS solution and 2.5 μL TEMED. Mix the solution\nby inverting 4-6 times, and pour the solution on top of the running gel to the top of\neach cassette.\nV. Quickly insert a comb into the stacking gel. The gel may take up to 30 minutes to\npolymerize. The purpose of the stacking gel is to concentrate the protein samples as\nthey enter the running gel.\nVI. Once the gels have polymerized, place the cassettes in a plastic container with 1X\nTank buffer. Wrap the container in saran wrap to prevent the gel from drying out and\nstore the gel at 4 oC. You will use your gel in Session 7.\n\n2.) Preparation of SDS-PAGE samples\n\nYou should prepare the following gel samples: pre-induction, post-induction, and all\nseven Ni-NTA column elution samples.\n\nTo prepare the pre- and post-induction samples, thaw the saved pellets at room\ntemperature, and add 24 μL of the 6X sample loading buffer to each pellet. For the\nelution samples, combine 20 μL of each sample with 4 μL of the 6X gel loading buffer in\n1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes. Boil all of the samples for 3 to 5 minutes to fully denature the\nproteins. The samples can be stored at room temperature until they are used in Session 7.\n\nSESSIONS 7 and 8 (lab open 1-5 pm)\nNote: Sessions 7 and 8 can be combined into one laboratory day if you would prefer one\nlong session instead of two short sessions.\n\nDuring Sessions 7 and 8 you will analyze the purified H396P Abl(229-511) by SDS-\nPAGE gel electrophoresis. You will also determine the concentration of your protein\ndomain after purification and dialysis.\n\n1.) Running an SDS-PAGE gel\nRemove your cast gel from the storage container, remove the white strip of tape from the\nbottom of your gel, and place the cassette in the gel running apparatus. Two gels fit in a\ngel box, so two groups of students should use each box. Fill the apparatus with 1X\nelectrophoresis (TANK) buffer such that the section between the two gels is filled to the\ntop and the outer sections are filled halfway with buffer. Carefully remove the gel comb.\nUsing gel-loading pipette tips on a 20p pipette, load 5 uL of protein ladder (provided by\nyour TA) into a corner well of your gel. The protein ladder consists of proteins with\nknown molecular weights conjugated to visible dyes and does not need to mixed with the\nsample loading buffer. See the posting on the -20 freezer or the figure below to identify\nthe molecular weight markers in the protein ladder. In the next two wells, load 10 uL of\nthe pre and post-induction samples. In the final 7 wells, load your Ni-NTA elution\nsamples. Run the gel at 200 V until the blue dye reaches the bottom of the gel\n(approximately 45 to 60 min).\n\nOnce the gel running is complete, disassemble the gel apparatus, and carefully pry\nthe cassette apart with a spatula. Transfer the gel into a container for staining. Running a\nlight stream of water over the gel can help prevent gel tearing during cassette separation\nand gel transfer. Add enough Coomasie blue staining solution to cover the gel (10 to 25\nmL), and place the container on the gel rocker. Rock the gel in the stain for 30 minutes.\nPour the used staining solution into a designated bottle, and rinse the gel with water. To\ndestain, cover the gel with fast destaining solution and add a balled-up Kimwipe to the\ncorner of the gel container. Rock the gel at room temperature for 30 to 50 min, then\nreplace the fast destain with the slow destain solution and rock the gel overnight. For the\novernight destain, add a fresh Kimwipe and cover the container with saranwrap to avoid\nexcessive evaporation (especially during the winter months).\n\n250 kDa\n150 kDa\n100 kDa\n75 kDa\n50 kDa\n37 kDa\n25 kDa\n20 kDa\n15 kDa\n10 kDa\n\nBio-rad precision plus\n\nMolecular weight markers\n\nThe H396P Abl kinase domain should appear as a band at approximately 33 kDa.\nDepending on the protein concentration, some impurities may be visible in the more\nconcentrated elution fractions. In the literature, these impurities have been reduced or\neliminated by running a second column. However, we will use the singly purified protein\nfor our assays, since we are interested in comparing the activity with vs. without inhibitor\nrather than determining absolute activity.\n\nSESSION 7B (lab open 1-2 pm)\n\nAfter destaining, pour the destain solution in a designated waste bottle and check your gel\nfor protein bands. You should rinse the gel with water and take a digital picture for your\nlaboratory report. Once you have a decent picture of your gel, you may discard it.\n\nSESSION 8\n\n1.) H396P Abl(229-511) Protein Concentration\n\nUsing a syringe, transfer the dialyzed protein solution from the dialysis cassette into a 15-\nmL conical tube. The cassette cannot be reused and should be discarded after use.\n\nConcentrate the protein solution to a final volume of approximately 500 μL using a\nMillipore 10-KDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator. For concentration, add up to 12 mL\nat a time of your dialyzed protein solution to the concentrator tube and replace the cap.\nPlace the concentrator tube with the volume gradations facing up in the centrifuge. Add a\ncounterbalance, either another group's sample or a 50-mL conical tube with the\nappropriate volume of water to balance your concentrator tube. Spin at 500 x g until you\nreach the desired volume, approximately 15 to 45 minutes. Use a pipette to recover your\nconcentrated protein from the filter unit in the concentrator tube. For maximum protein\nrecovery, withdraw the protein from the bottom of the filter unit and use a \"side-to-side\nsweeping motion\". You should remove the concentrated protein solution as soon as\npossible following centrifugation.\n\nStore your protein in a clearly labeled eppendorf at 4 °C for use in Sessions 13 and 14.\n\n2.) Protein Quantification\n\nUse the Bio-Rad quantification assay (Session 4) to determine the protein concentration\nof the H396P Abl kinase domain after purification, dialysis, and concentration. See\nAppendix A1 for a review on preparing your BSA samples from the 1 mM BSA stock\nyou made in Session 4.\n\nClearly label the dialyzed protein with your names, your TA's name, and the date.\nStore the solution at 4 °C.\n\nSESSION 9 (lab open 1-3 pm)\n\nDuring laboratory Sessions 9 and 10 you will perform site-directed mutagenesis to\nconstruct the DNA for a mutant Abl kinase domain with a single amino acid substitution.\nYou will transform cells for subsequent isolation of your mutant DNA.\n\n1.) Preparation of mutagenesis primers\n\nFor the mutagenesis reactions 10 μM solutions of your forward and reverse primers\nshould be prepared with ddH20. Before opening the primer containers, which contain\nyour primer DNA as lyophilized power, briefly centrifuge the tubes for 30 to 60 seconds.\nCalculate and add the necessary amount of water to achieve a 10 μM solution, and store\nyour primer solutions at 4 oC short term and at -20 °C long term.\n\n2.) Amplification of the mutant plasmid by PCR\n\nYou will set up a series of PCR reactions with various concentrations of DNA template\n(your isolated plasmid DNA) to produce plasmids containing the desired base-pair\nsubstitution. By varying the amount of DNA template, you will determine the reaction\nconditions that ultimately produce colonies with the least amount of template DNA\npossible, which maximizes the likelihood of isolating a colony with the desired mutation.\nWhile there must be enough template DNA to facilitate replication, too much template\ncan result in incomplete digestion after the PCR, resulting in undesired amplification of\nthe wild type DNA. Also essential for successful mutagenesis is the use of PfuTurbo as\nthe DNA polymerase. Unlike standard PCR reactions, which require replication of a 1 to\n2 kb insert, mutagenesis requires replication of an entire plasmid, which can be 5 or more\nkb (the pEt plasmid is approximately 6.1 kb with the Abl insert). PfuTurbo is used for its\nhigh fidelity and ability to extend very long templates.\n\nIn each of three sterile PCR tubes, add the following components in the order listed,\nwhere x = the volume of miniprep elution added (in μL) to give 10 ng of DNA.\n\n10 ng DNA\n\n20 ng DNA\n\n50 ng DNA\n10X Pfu buffer\n\n5 μL\n\n5 μL\n\n5 μL\ntemplate plasmid DNA\nx μL\n\n2x μL\n\n5x μL\n10 μM forward primer\n1.2 μL\n\n1.2 μL\n\n1.2 μL\n10 μM reverse primer\n1.2 μL\n\n1.2 μL\n\n1.2 μL\n10 mM dNTP mix\n\n1.0 μL\n\n1.0 μL\n\n1.0 μL\nddH20\n\n40.6 - x μL\n\n40.6 - 2x μL\n40.6 - 5x μL\nImmediately before starting the PCR machine, add:\nPfuTurbo, 2.5 units/ μL\n1.0 μL\n\n1.0 μL\n\n1.0 μL\n\n________\n\n________\n\n________\nFinal volume\n\n50 μL\n\n50 μL\n\n50 μL\n\nMix the reactions gently by pipetting 4-6 times, and place the tubes in the thermal cycler.\nThe length of the PCR program is critical for successful mutagenesis because the Pfu\n\npolymerase requires ample time to extend around the full plasmid. Your TA will\ndemonstrate how to set the following PCR program: 95 °C for 30 sec; [16-20 cycles of 95\n°C for 30 sec: 55 °C for 1 min: 65 °C for 2 min per kb plasmid]; then hold at 10 °C. Since\nthe plasmid you are using is approximately 6 kb, each 65 °C extension will be for 12 min.\nThe class should load the PCR reactions in the thermal cycler together and the TA will\nstart the run. The run will take over 4 hours, and the reaction tubes may be left overnight\nin the cycler after the run is complete.\n\nSESSION 9B (lab open from 1 to 2)\n1.) Remove your reaction from the thermal cycle and store at 4 oC.\n\nSESSION 10 (lab open 1 to 5 pm)\n\n1.) DpnI digestion of the PCR reaction\n\nAs described in the Quikchange mutation overview (in Session 3), the purpose of DpnI\ntreatment is to digest away the template (wild type) DNA, such that the only remaining\nplasmid is the mutation-containing PCR product. Sufficiently high DpnI concentration\nand digestion time are essential for complete digestion of the template DNA in order to\nprevent carrying over the wt plasmid into the transformation, which could result in the\nisolation of wt, instead of mutated, DNA. For each 50-μL PCR reaction, transfer 10 μL of\nthe crude reaction into a fresh tube. Add 1 μL of DpnI (10 units/ μL) and mix thoroughly\nby pipetting 4-6 times. Transfer the 10-μL reaction to a new tube to ensure that all the\nDNA in the tube has been exposed to Dpn1. Incubate the digestion at 37 °C for at least 1\nhour. The crude digestion product can be used directly in a transformation reaction. Extra\nPCR and digestion products should be labeled and stored at -20 °C.\n\n2.) Preparation of LB/kan agar plates\n\nWhile the DpnI digestion incubates, prepare LB/kan agar plates for your transformation\nreaction. To prepare 4 plates, weigh out 5 g of LB powder and 3 g of bacto-agar in a 200-\nmL flask. Add 100-mL of water, and cover the top of the flask with aluminum foil. Add a\npiece of autoclave-indicator tape to the side of the flask and autoclave the solution for 20\nmin on the liquid cycle. Several groups should autoclave their media in a single autoclave\nrun to avoid extra waiting time. Once autoclaved, allow the solution to cool to\napproximately 55 oC, such that you can hold the flask comfortably. Add 100 μL of\n1000X kan to give a final concentration of 50 μg/ mL, and swirl the flask to mix.\nImmediately transfer 25-mL aliquots of the mixture to cell culture plates using a 100-mL\npipette. Allow the agar to solidify for at least 15 minutes before using. Store any unused\nplates at 4 oC.\n\n3.) Transformation of DH5α cells\n\nBacterial transformation involves the uptake of foreign DNA into a cell for subsequent\nexpression. While a small percent of bacterial species (approximately 1%) have the\ngenetic capacity to take in outside DNA through the cell membrane, transformation is\ncommonly achieved using procedures that render bacterial cells passively permeable by\nheat shock or electroporation. In this procedure, you will use heat-shock competent cells,\nwhich work best with plasmid DNA, for your transformation. Heat-shock competent cells\nare prepared by incubating the chilled cells with divalent metal ions to increase their\npermeability. After incubation with plasmid DNA, briefly heating the cells results in\nuptake of the foreign plasmid. Careful timing is essential to maximize DNA\nincorporation while minimizing cell destruction.\n\nPlates should be placed in the 37 °C incubator with the LB/agar side up.\n\nI. For each transformation reaction, thaw a single 30-uL aliquot of heat-shock\ncompetent DH5α cells in an ice bucket. Today you will set up a total of four\ntransformation reactions: three for the mutagenesis products and one as a positive\ncontrol with your isolated wt plasmid DNA. Competent cells cannot be refrozen\nfor later use, so please do not remove more aliquots then you will use from the -\n80 oC freezer.\nII. Keep your plasmid DNA from the DpnI digestions and your miniprep of wt Abl\nDNA chilled in the ice bucket\nIII. For each transformation reaction, add 25 μL of cells and 1 μL of DNA (either\nfrom the crude Dpn1 digestion mixture of from your miniprep) in a 1.5-mL sterile\neppendorf tube on ice. Typically, the DNA samples used are 0.5 to 1 μg/ μL. Mix\nthe cells gently by stirring with the pipette tip.\nIV. Heat shock the cells by placing the tubes in a 42 °C water bath for exactly 45\nseconds. Use a timer to ensure that the cells are not overexposed.\nV. Immediately transfer the tubes to an ice bucket. Incubate the cells on ice for 2\nminutes, then add 500 μL of SOB to rescue the cells.\nVI. Transfer the cell solutions to cell culture tubes.\nVII. Incubate the tubes at 37 °C in a shaker (220 rpm) for 30-60 minutes. 30 min.\nshould be adequate for routine transformations, such as this one.\nVIII. For each cell solution, plate 200 μL onto a room temperature or 37 °C LB/kan\nagar plate that has been divided into 4 sections by marker on the bottom of the\nplate. Streak the plate as shown by your TA across the four quadrants. Label\neach plate as mutant or wt, specify the point mutation on the mutant plates, and\ninclude the amount of DNA template used for the mutant reactions. Write your\nname and your TA's name on each plate as well.\nIX. Incubate the plates overnight in the 37 °C incubator.\n\nSESSION 10B (lab open from 1-2 pm)\nPick individual colonies to grow up for DNA isolation (miniprep)\n\nAdd 3 mL of autoclaved LB solution (from your 100-mL preparation in week 1) into\neach of 3 cell culture tubes. Confirm that your LB media is contamination-free by\nchecking that the solution is clear. Add 3 μL of a 1000X (50 mg/ mL) kan stock solution\nto each tube to give a final concentration of 50 μL/mg kan.\n\nRemove your LB-kan agar plates from the 37 oC incubator. Confirm that your wt Abl\ntransformation was successful in generating hundreds or thousands of colonies on the\ndesignated plate. Estimate and record the number of colonies on the plates transformed\nwith DNA from your mutagesis with 10, 20, or 50 ng of template DNA.\n\nUsing a sterile pipette tip, transfer a colony to a cell culture tube from the mutant DNA\nplate with bacteria transformed with the mutagenesis mixture using the least amount of\ntemplate DNA. For example, if you have colonies on all of your plates, use the plate from\nthe mutagenesis reaction with 10 ng of DNA. This further decreases the likelihood of\nselecting a colony that contains wt DNA.\n\nSelect 2 more colonies from the same mutant DNA plate, and inoculate the solutions in\nthe other 2 cell culture tubes. Be careful to never mix colonies, since each colony\ncontains a different DNA clone and mixing could result in combining wt DNA with DNA\ncontaining the desired mutation.\n\nPlace the culture tubes in a 37 °C shaker overnight. On Wednesday you will isolate the\nplasmid DNA from the 3 selected colonies.\n\nFor any groups that experimented with a new point mutation (that hasn't been optimized\nfor this lab), you may or may not have colonies from your mutant DNA transformations.\nIf you are not in one of the lucky groups with colonies, you should pick a colony from\nanother group's plate and record your new target mutation. Quikchange mutatgenesis\ncan require optimization and does not work for every mutation imaginable, and your\ngrade will NOT be affected by whether or not your mutagenesis succeeded, assuming\nyour primer design and Quikchange procedure were competently executed.\n\nSESSION 11 (lab open 1-5 pm)\n\nToday you will isolate your mutant DNA from the transformed cells. You will then\ndesign primers (or use T7 primers) to sequence your mutant DNA and prepare samples\nfor sequencing.\n\n1.) DNA isolation of mutant plasmid DNA\n\nIsolate the DNA from your three selected colonies. A general miniprep procedure can be\nfound in Appendix A3 and is included below. Note that this is the same procedure that\nyou carried out for isolation of the wt Abl(229-511)-encoding plasmid DNA in session 2.\nBased on your skillful lab work and a little luck, at least one of these plasmids should\ncontain the desired mutation.\n\nDNA isolation from a bacterial pellet (miniprep)\nhttp://www1.qiagen.com/literature/handbooks/PDF/PlasmidDNAPurification/PLS_QP_\nMiniprep/1043788_HB_QIAprep_122006.pdf\n\na.) Harvest the bacterial cells from your 3-mL overnight culture by transferring 1.5 mL\ninto a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and spinning down the cells in a microcentrifuge for 3\nminutes. Discard the supernatant and add the remaining 1.5 mL of cell culture to the tube.\nRepeat the centrifugation and discard the supernatant. You should have a small bacterial\npellet at the bottom of the tube.\nb.) Check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. Add 250 μL of Buffer P1 to the cell\npellet and completely resuspend the pellet by vortexing.\nc.) Add 250 μL of Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Do not vortex,\nsince that can cause shearing of the DNA. If you have properly lysed the cells, the cell\nsuspension will turn blue after the addition of the P2 buffer. If there are colorless regions\nor brown clumps in the cells, continue mixing until a homogenous blue solution appears.\nd.) Add 350 μL of Buffer N3 and mix immediately by inverting the tube 4-6 times. The\nsolution should become colorless and cloudy.\ne.) Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in you bench top microcentrifuge. A\ncompact white pellet should form.\nf.) Apply the resulting supernatant (which contains the plasmid DNA) to a QIAprep spin\ncolumn by decanting or pipetting.\ng.) Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow through.\nh.) Wash the spin column by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 s.\nDiscard the flow through.\ni.) Centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. This is essential for\nthe success of any future enzymatic reactions.\nj.) Place the QIAprep spin column into a clean and labeled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTo elute DNA, add 50 μL of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.5) to the center of the spin\ncolumn, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.\n\nFor long term storage, keep purified DNA at -20 °C.\n\n2.) Quantification of DNA concentration\nCalculate the concentration of each of your three miniprep elutions. For each sample,\ndissolve x μL (typically, 1-3 μL) in 100 μL of water. Measure the absorbance at 260 nm\nin a quartz cuvette. See Section Appendix A2 for UV/Vis spectrophotometer\ninstructions. To calculate the concentration in μg/μL of your double stranded (ds) DNA,\nmultiply the Abs260 by (0.05)(100/x). Typical concentrations of miniprepped DNA are\n0.1-2 μg/μL.\nCalculate the concentration of each of your three miniprep elutions, as was done\npreviously for your wt Abl(229-511)-containing plamid. See Appendix A4 for\ninstructions on measuring and calculating DNA concentration. You will use some of the\nminiprepped DNA for sequencing and should store the remaining DNA, labeled with the\ndesired mutation and numbered 1-3 at -20 °C.\n\n3.) Preparation of DNA sequencing samples\n\nYou will send the plasmid DNA isolated from the three selected colonies for DNA\nsequencing to check for the desired mutation. For each submission, combine the\nfollowing in a DNA sequencing tube:\n\n3.2 pmol of your sequencing primer\n\n200-500 ng of the plasmid DNA\n\nddH20 to a final volume of 12 μL\n\nLabel each tube with a 3 letter name that is distinguishable from all other samples in the\nclass, and fill in the information on a numbered sequencing sheet for the class. Make\nnote of the numbers of your samples as well as the names, since the sequencing can come\nback with numbers only.\n\nSESSION 12 (lab open 1-4 pm)\n\nYour TA will assign you one or several of the following buffers, all of which will be used\nfor the coupled phosphorylation assay in Sessions 13 and 14.\n\n- 10 x Kinase Buffer: 1 M Tris base (FW 121.14) pH 7.5, 100 mM MgCl2.This\nshould be prepared in several steps:\n1. First prepare 1 L of a 1M solution of Tris: In a 1 L bottle, combine\n_______ g Tris, and 0.8 L of room temperature DI water. Adjust the pH to\n7.5 with HCl (it is recommended to start with concentrated HCl and then\nswitch to 1.0 M HCl as you get close to the desired pH.). Add water to a\nfinal volume of 1 L.\n2. Next prepare 10 mL of an approximately 3 M solution of MgCl2-6H2O\n(FW 203.31) in 0.1 M HCl. Record the actual concentration of your\nsolution. The 0.1 M HCl keeps the solution acidic to prevent the MgCl2\nfrom crashing out of solution during storage.\n3. Prepare 10 mL of the 10 x kinase buffer (to avoid MgCl2 crashing out at\nneutral pH, do not store it for more than a few weeks). For example, if the\nMgCl2 solution was 2.66 M, you should add 385 uL of 2.66 M MgCl2 to\n9.615 mL of the 1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The Tris concentration will be\nonly negligibly less than 1 M.\n\n- 100 mM ATP, pH 7.5 (ε259 = 15400 M-1cm-1). ATP FW = 551.14 (anhydrous).\nTo prepare 9 ml of a 100 mM ATP solution, add g of ATP to 7 mL water.\nAdjust the pH of the solution to 7.5 using 1 M NaOH (approximately 1.3 mL will\nbe needed for the pH adjustment). Be careful NOT to overshoot the pH! If the\nsolution becomes too basic, the ATP will hydrolyze and will be useless in the\nupcoming kinase assay. If you overshoot the pH, you should discard your solution\nand start over.\n\nAfter reaching a pH of 7.5, add water to a final volume of 9 mL.\n\nDetermine the exact pH of the ATP solution by absorption spectroscopy. The\n\napparent weight of the ATP is likely to include some water, which results in a\n\nlower than expected concentration. Record the Abs at 259 for a 1/4000 dilution of\n\nthe ATP solution and calculate the actual ATP concentration using Beer's Law\n\n(Abs = εcl). Aliquot the ATP solution into 100-uL samples in 0.5 mL-eppendorf\n\ntubes and store the labeled-aliqots at -20 oC.\n\n- 35 mM PEP. FW = 208.04. Add 100 mg of PEP to 13.7 mL of water. Store the\nsolution in 200-μL aliquots in the -20 °C freezer. (provided by TA)\n\n- 12 mM NADH. (FW of the hydrate: 709.40). Since NADH easily takes on water\nweight, attempt a 14 mM solution by adding \"10 mg\"/mL of NADH. In a 15-mL\nconical tube, add \"5 mg\" of NADH to 0.5 mL of water. Calculate the actual\nconcentration (which will likely be close to 12 mM) by measuring the absorption\nat 340 (ε340 = 6220 M-1cm-1). The pH of NADH solution does not need to be\nadjusted. Store labeled aliquots at -20 °C. (provided by TA)\n\n- 20 mM stock of the substrate peptide, Ac-EAIYAAPFAKKK-NH2. (MW\n1377.6584). For a 900 μL solution of peptide (final volume), add 25 mg (18\nμmol) of peptide to a 15-mL conical tube. Add 700 μL of 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5 or\nwater to the lyophilized peptide. The peptide solution will initially be very acidic\ndue to TFA contamination from peptide HPLC purification. To neutralize the\nsolution, add 1 M NaOH until the pH is approximately 7.5. For one previous\npreparation of this peptide, 9 uL of 1 M NaOH was required for neutralization,\nbut this will differ with every batch of peptide, depending on how much residual\nTFA is with the peptide. After neutralization, add 100 mM Tris buffer or water to\ngive a final volume of 900 μL. The peptide should be labeled, dated, and stored at\n-20 oC in 50-μL aliquots. (provided by TA)\n\nOnce the buffers above are made, all groups should prepare their own 1x assay buffer to\nuse in Sessions 13 and 14:\n\nPreparation of 2 mL* of 1 x assay buffer\n\nIn order to save time and allow you to easily and reproducibly repeat the coupled\nphosphorylation assay, you should prepare a 1x assay buffer that contains all of the\nreagents in the kinase assay except for the kinase, the substrate peptide, and the PK/LDH\n(coupling enzymes). Once you make up this buffer, you should store it at -20 °C. It is ok\nto freeze/thaw the buffer and use it as needed.\n\n* 2 mL refers to the final volume after the addition of the kinase, peptide, and PK/LDH.\nThe volume of the assay buffer alone will be 1.44 mL.\n\nFor 2 mL* of 1x assay buffer, combine the following in a 2 mL eppendorf tube:\n- μL of 10x kinase buffer\n- μL of 35 mM PEP for a final concentration of 1 mM\n- μL of mM ATP for a final concentration of 2 mM\n- μL of mM NADH for a final concentration of 0.11 mg/mL or 155\nμM. (Make sure the frozen stock that you use is recent.)\n- of distilled water to give a \"final\" volume of 1440 μL\n\n(This leaves 560 μL of spare volume for the enzymes and peptide.)\n\nStore your 1x assay buffer in 400-μL aliquots in the -20 C freezer. Label your tubes well\nso the assay buffer is not confused with the 10x kinase buffer!\n\nSESSION 13 and SESSION 14 (lab open 1-5 pm each day)\nSign up for UV/Vis time with your TA. The class will be split into a 1-3 or a 3-5 pm slot.\n\nDuring laboratory Sessions 13 and 14 you will\n- Use a coupled phosphorylation assay to determine the specific activity of the wild\ntype Abl kinase domain 1) in the absence of an inhibitor 2) in the presence of the\ndrug Gleevec (FDA approved in 2001) and 3) in the presence of the drug\nDasatinib (FDA approved in 2006)\n- Use a coupled phosphorylation assay to determine the specific activity of the\nH396P Abl kinase domain 1) in the absence of an inhibitor 2) in the presence of\nthe drug Gleevec and 3) in the presence of the drug Dasatinib\n\nResearchers use a variety of strategies to monitor the activity of kinases. You will recall\nthat kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of substrate peptides or\nproteins by transferring a phosphate group from a molecule of ATP to the substrate.\nPhosphorylation is spectroscopically silent, which means that we can monitor neither the\nformation of the phosphorylated product, nor the conversion of ATP to ADP directly\nusing spectroscopy. This is because the products would appear identical to the starting\nmaterials due to identical absorption features and extinction coefficients. In order to\nmonitor the activity of your wild type and mutant Abl kinase domains, you will therefore\nuse a coupled assay, which \"couples\" the conversion of ADP to ATP with the conversion\nof NADH to NAD+, a process that can be detected by a decrease in absorbance at 340\nnm. This coupling assay is outlined in Fig.3.\n\nFigure 3. The Kinase Coupled Assay for Abl Activity\n\nIt is possible to use the kinase coupled assay to generate quantitative kinetic data on the\nkinase of interest. You will use this assay to determine the specific activity of the wt and\nmutant Abl kinase domains in the absence and presence of small molecule inhibitors,\nincluding Gleevec. Specific activity in biochemistry is defined as the amount of product\nformed by an enzyme in a given amount of time. Specific activity is often reported in\n\nunits (U) per mg of enzyme, where 1 unit is equal to 1 μmol of product formed per\ninute.\nVis spectrometer.

Is Gleevec an\neffective inhibitor of mutant H396P Abl kinase activity in vitro? Is Dasatinib an effective\ninhibitor of (wild type) Abl kinase activity in vitro? Is Dasatinib an effective inhibitor\nmutant H396P Abl kinase activity in vitro?\n\nNote on data analysis: In the laboratory report you will compare the specific activity in\nthe absence and presence of inhibitors for both the wt and the H396P mutant Abl kinase\ndomains. You will NOT compare absolute values of specific activities between the wt and\nmutant. A comparison of wt versus mutant absolute specific activities is not valid with\nthis experimental design because of differences in purity and storage of the\n(commercially available) wt and the (bacterially expressed and singly purified) mutant\ndomains. In addition, measurements for the wt and mutant domains are taken on different\ndays and possibly on different instruments. A 2006 study demonstrated that the H396P\nmutant has decreased in vitro kinase activity compared to the wild type (Griswold et al,\n2006).\n\nSESSION 15\n\nSession 15 is the final laboratory session in Module 5.

Is this sheet located at the C or N\nterminus of the kinase domain? N-terminus\n5) What residues comprise this beta-sheet? For this answer do not include the helix that\nis between the strands, so you should list two ranges. (For example \"S229-G250 and\nL340-A350\" would in the correct form- although this is not the correct answer). It\nmay be helpful to zoom in on your structure to answer this question. I(242)-L(266)\nand L(301)-E(316)\n6) Where are most of the hydrophobic residues located, on the inside or the outside of\nthe protein? (You may want to switch back and forth from viewing the sticks to the\ncartoon form to get a better view of this.) on the inside\n7) Where are most of the polar residues located? on the outside\n8) Does this make sense in terms of protein folding? Explain. Yes. The residues on\nthe outside of a protein will interact with water molecules, so it makes sense for\nthem to be polar. The hydrophobic molecules are both shielded from the water\nand able to interact with each other on the inside of the protein.\n9) When bound to Gleevec, is the A loop of the Abl kinase domain in the open\n(extended) or closed conformation? Very briefly explain your answer. Closed. The\nactivation loop is blocking the substrate binding site and the Asp residue of the\nDFG motif is pointing away from the ATP binding site.\n10) When bound to Gleevec, is Abl kinase domain in the active or inactive form. Very\nbriefly explain your answer. Inactive. The A loop is closed in the inactive\nconformation.\n11) What groups on the structure of Gleevec above could participate in hydrogen\nbonds? (Draw Gleevec and indicate the groups by circling).\nN\nN\nHN\nN\nNH\nO\nN\nN\n\n12) Looking at the Abl structure, name the residues that appear to hydrogen bond to\nGleevec and give the distances between the atoms.

Thr residue. H-bond.\n15) What might you predict would happen if this residue were mutated to Asn or Ile?\nH-bond would not be possible and there would be steric interference with\nGleevec binding.\n16) What if this residue were mutated to Ala? H-bond not possible. No steric effect.\n17) Is residue 315 interacting with Dasatinib? If so, describe the interaction. Yes. H-\nbond.\n18) Would you expect Dasatinib to effectively inhibit an Abl mutant with residue 315\nmutated to an Ile? Very briefly explain why or why not. No. H-bond would break\nand would sterically interefere with binding (although not as extremely as for\nGleevec)\n19) When bound to Dasatinib, is the A loop of the Abl kinase domain in the open\n(extended) or closed conformation? Very briefly explain your answer. Open. The\nactivation loop away from the substrate binding site and the Asp residue of the\nDFG motif is pointing into the ATP binding site.\n20) How does the location of residue 393 differ in the two structures? In the Gleevec-\nbound structure, Tyr393 is in the substrate binding pocket, and in the\nDasatinib-bound structure, Tyr 393 is moved far away from the substrate\nbinding pocket.\n21) Very briefly compare the binding orientation of Gleevec and Dasatinib. Many\nanswers are acceptable for this. For example, students could draw the parts of\nthe two molecules that overlap and the parts that are pointing in opposite\ndirections. Alternatively, they could write that Gleevec binds deep into a\nhydrophobic pocket, while Dasatinib binds more similarly to ATP (they would\nneed to look at their Lecture 4 notes to see this).\n22) The H396P mutation in Abl destabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase.\nBased on the Gleevec-bound and Dasatinib-bound structures of wt Abl, explain how\nyour laboratory results from the kinase activity assays with wt and H396P Abl are\nconsistent (or not consistent) with these structures. (If you have not yet completed\n\nSession 14, predict what you would expect to see in the H396P assays based\nstructural evidence. Compare this to your actual results after completing your\nassays.) The structures show that Gleevec binds the inactive form, and\nDasatinib binds the active form. This is consistent with the kinase assays, which\nshow that the wt Abl is inhibited by both Gleevec and Dasatinib (consistent with\nthe fact that the wt can take on both the active and inactive forms), while H396P\nis only inhibited by Dasatinib (which makes sense because the inactive form is\ndestabilized in this mutant).\n\nList of Abbreviations:\n\nAbl (or c-Abl)\nAbelson kinase\nAbl(229-511)\nthe Abelson kinase domain, which is constitutively active for\n\nkinase activity when expressed as an isolated domain\nAPS\n\nammonium persulfate\nbp\n\nbase pairs\nEtBr\n\nethidium bromide\nIPTG\n\nIsopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranosid\nkan\n\nkanamycin, an antibiotic\nkb\n\nkilobase pairs\nMW\n\nmolecular weight (reported in g/mol)\nOD600\n\noptical density (absorbance) at 600 nm\nRE\n\nrestriction enzyme\nstrep\n\nstreptomycin, an antibiotic\nTAE\n\ntris acetate electrophoresis\nTBS\n\ntris buffered saline\nTm\n\nmelting temperature\nTEMED\n\netramethylethylenediamine\nwt\n\nwild type\nw/v\n\nweight/volume\n\nAPPENDIX A: Common biochemistry laboratory procedures used multiple times in\nURIECA modules 4 and 5.\n\nA1: Bio-Rad assay for quantifying protein concentrations\nhttp://www.fhcrc.org/science/labs/hahn/methods/biochem_meth/biorad_assay.pdf\n\nFirst prepare bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions to use as standards. To\nprepare 5 mL of a 1 mg/mL aqueous solution of BSA, weigh out 5 mg of BSA into a 15-\nmL conical tube, add 5 mL of water, and invert or vortex the tube to completely dissolve\nthe BSA. BSA aliquots may be stored long term at -20 °C. Prior to each assay, prepare\nfive dilutions of the BSA stock solution to create a standard curve. The linear range of the\nBio-Rad protein assay is 0.2 to 0.9 mg/mL. Therefore in six separate 0.65-mL eppendorf\ntubes, label and add the following: 270 μL of the BSA stock and 30 μL of deionized\nwater (to give 0.9 mg/mL), 210 μL of BSA and 90 μL of water (to give 0.7 mg/mL), 165\nμL of BSA and 135 μL of water (to give 0.55 mg/mL), 120 μL of BSA and 180 μL of\nwater (to give 0.4 mg.mL), 60 μL of BSA and 240 μL of water (to give 0.2 mg/mL), and\nno BSA and 300 uL of water (to use as your \"blank\").\n\nPrepare 20 mL of the assay dye reagent by diluting one part Bio-Rad dye\nconcentrate with four parts DI water. Filter the resulting solution and store any unused\nreagent for up to two weeks at room temperature. To create a standard curve using the\nBSA standards, pipette 20 μL of each standard into an eppendorf tube. Add 980 μL of the\nprepared dye reagent to each tube and vortex briefly. Incubate the tubes at room\ntemperature for 5 to 50 minutes. Measure the absorbance of each solution at 595 nm by\nUV/Vis spectrometry using disposable polystyrene cuvettes. The sample with 20 μL of\nwater in 980 μL of assay reagent should be used as your \"blank\" in the\nspectrophotometer. Plot the absorbance vs. concentration for the BSA standards using\nMicrosoft Excel or another graphing program and determine the R-squared value and\nslope of the best-fit line to establish that you can obtain a strait line with your standards.\nIf your R-squared value is less than 0.9, repeat the exercise until you achieve an\nacceptable line. Good laboratory practice calls for the creation of a new standard curve\neach time you run a protein assay.\n\nTo determine the concentration of unknown samples, combine 20 uL of your\nsample (or an appropriate dilution) with 980 μL of assay reagent and measure the\nabsorbance at 595. Use the slope of the standard curve to calculate the sample\nconcentration in mg/mL.\n\nA2: Varian Cary 100 Spectrophotometer Instructions\n\n1. Turn on the spectrophotometer.\n2. Open the \"simple reads\" program, found as a desktop icon or under the Cary\nWinUV menu under the \"Start\" button.\n3. The lamps are on if under the \"Commands\" menu \"Lamps Off\" is displayed. If\n\"Lamps On\" is displayed, click on it to turn on the lamps. For accurate\nmeasurements, allow the lamp to warm up for at least 15 minutes before use.\n4. To set the instrument, click the \"Setup...\" command button on the left side of the\nscreen. In the \"Read the wavelength\" scroll box, type in the desired wavelength.\n\nThe \"Abs\" button in \"Y mode\" should be selected. When the setup is complete,\nclick the \"OK\" button to exit the window.\n5. Prior to measuring the absorbance of your samples, you must zero the instrument.\nTo do this, open the lid and determine which cell is in the light path. Insert a\ncuvette with your blanking solution in the instrument. Close the lid completely,\nand press the \"Zero\" command button on the left side of the screen to zero the\ninstrument at the chosen wavelength. The blank should now have a absorbance\nread of zero give or take the small amount of \"noise\" present at all times.\n6. You are now ready to measure the absorbance of your samples. Insert a cuvette\ncontaining a sample into the instrument, close the lid completely, and press the\n\"Read\" button at the top of the screen. Record the absorbance measurement.\n7. Under the \"File\" menu, select \"Print\" to print your data.\n8. When finished, close the program and return to the desktop.\n9. Turn off the lamps, then turn off the instrument.\n\nA3: DNA isolation from a bacterial pellet (miniprep)\nhttp://www1.qiagen.com/literature/handbooks/PDF/PlasmidDNAPurification/PLS_QP_\nMiniprep/1043788_HB_QIAprep_122006.pdf\n\nMiniprep Procedure:\na.) Harvest the bacterial cells from your 3-mL overnight culture by transferring 1.5 mL\ninto a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and spinning down the cells in a microcentrifuge for 3\nminutes. Discard the supernatant and add the remaining 1.5 mL of cell culture to the tube.\nRepeat the centrifugation and discard the supernatant. You should have a small bacterial\npellet at the bottom of the tube.\nb.) Check that RNaseA has been added to Buffer P1. Add 250 μL of Buffer P1 to the cell\npellet and completely resuspend the pellet by vortexing.\nc.) Add 250 μL of Buffer P2 and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Do not vortex,\nsince that can cause shearing of the DNA. If you have properly lysed the cells, the cell\nsuspension will turn blue after the addition of the P2 buffer. If there are colorless regions\nor brown clumps in the cells, continue mixing until a homogenous blue solution appears.\nd.) Add 350 μL of Buffer N3 and mix immediately by inverting the tube 4-6 times. The\nsolution should become colorless and cloudy.\ne.) Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in you bench top microcentrifuge. A\ncompact white pellet should form.\nf.) Apply the resulting supernatant (which contains the plasmid DNA) to a QIAprep spin\ncolumn by decanting or pipetting.\ng.) Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow through.\nh.) Wash the spin column by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 s.\nDiscard the flow through.\ni.) Centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. This is essential for\nthe success of any future enzymatic reactions.\nj.) Place the QIAprep spin column into a clean and labeled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nTo elute DNA, add 50 μL of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.5) to the center of the spin\ncolumn, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.\n\nFor long term storage, keep purified DNA at -20 °C.\n\nA4: Quantification of DNA concentration\nDissolve x μL (typically, 1-3 μL) of DNA sample in 100 μL of water. Measure the\nabsorbance at 260 nm in a quartz cuvette. See Section Appendix A2 for UV/Vis\nspectrophotometer instructions. To calculate the concentration in μg/μL of your double\nstranded (ds) DNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.05)(100/x). Typical concentrations of\nminiprepped DNA are 0.1-2 μg/μL. To calculate the concentration of single stranded (ss)\nDNA or RNA, multiply the Abs260 by (0.04)(100/x) instead.\nTo convert the concentration to mol/L, use the fact that 1 base pair has a molecular\nweight of ~650 g/mol, so a 5 kb plasmid has a typical molecular weight of 3.3x106 g/mol.\nFor ssDNA or RNA, use a molecular weight of 325 g/mol per nucleotide.\n\nAPPENDIX B: Protein and Nucleotide Sequences\n\nB1: Protein Sequence of c-Abl(229-511) (283 AA; 32,730 MW) from ABL1_HUMAN\nSwissprot accession number: P00519 (http://www.expasy.org/uniprot/P00519).\nNumbering is for isoform 1A.

This\nmeans that the kinase activity of c-Abl is tightly regulated, and the default activity setting\nis \"off\".\n\nA chromosomal abnormality implicated in chronic myleloid leukemia (CML)\ncauses the reciprocal translocation of genetic material from two different chromosomes, 9\nand 22, which results in the formation of a mutant gene that contains part of the BCR\n(break cluster region) gene from chromosome 22 and part of the ABL gene from\nchromosome 9. This mutant gene is called BCR-ABL, and the protein it encodes, denoted\nBcr-Abl, contains the kinase domain of c-Abl, but lacks the residues responsible for auto-\ninhibition. Bcr-Abl is therefore a constitutively active kinase, which means that the\nenzyme activity is permanently \"on\". This aberrant kinase activity is responsible for\nuncontrolled cell proliferation, which leads to cancer.\n\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nSH3\nSH2\ncap\nC-terminal\ndomains\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nSH3\nSH2\nC-terminal\ndomains\nBCR\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nc-Abl kinase (or Abl)\nThe activity of c-Abl is auto-inhibited by its\nN-terminal domains.

We will use it\nas a mimic of Bcr-Abl for our investigations. Like\nBcr-Abl, it is constitutively active.\nBCR\nAbl\nWe will abbreviate this below as\n\nA Small Molecule Drug for CML Treatment\n\nBcr-Abl activity is the underlying cause for CML, and the identification of the\nBcr-Abl oncoprotein led to high throughput screening and the \"rational design\" of\npotential small molecule inhibitors. These efforts culminated in the development of the\ndrug Gleevec by chemists at the pharmaceutical company Novartis (a branch of which is\na few doors down from us on Mass Ave). Gleevec (also known as Glivec, imatinib, and\nSTI-571) showed excellent efficacy against CML and was approved by the FDA in 2001.\nGleevec inhibits Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity by competitively binding in the ATP\nbinding pocket of the kinase domain and stabilizing the inactive conformation of the\nprotein. This development was particularly thrilling to the scientific community because\nGleevec is the first example of a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat human\ndisease. Also exciting is the striking specificity of Gleevec for Abl. Gleevec only inhibits\ntwo other proteins at physiological levels, neither of which result in problematic side\neffects.\n\nBcr\nAbl\nuncontrolled cell proliferation\n(cancer)\nACTIVE kinase\nBcr\nAbl\nACTIVE kinase\nBcr\nAbl\nINACTIVE kinase\nGleevec\nGleevec\nunc\n\nHowever....A PERCENTAGE OF CML PATIENTS DO NOT RESPOND TO\nGLEEVEC TREATMENT, AND OTHER PATIENTS THAT INITIALLY RESPOND\nTO TREATMENT EVENTUALLY DEVELOP GLEEVEC RESISTANCE.\nontrolled\nliferationX\ncell\npro\n(cancer)\n\nThe majority of these Gleevec-resistant cases can be linked to a single amino acid\nmutation in the Abl kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl protein.

The\nAbl kinase domain, similar to Bcr-Abl, lacks the N-terminal Abl regulation domains and\nis thus constitutively active. During this course you will express and purify an H396P\nmutant of the Abl kinase domain, a mutation that has been identified in patients with\nGleevec-resistent CML. You will use this mutant along with (commercially available)\nwild-type Abl kinase domain in a coupled phosphorylation assay to determine kinase\nactivity in the absence and presence of Gleevec and another kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib.\nIn addition, you will use site-directed mutagenesis to create a DNA expression vector for\nfuture expression of an another Gleevec-resistant Abl mutant of your choice.\nconstitutively active\nGleevec\nGleevec\nwild type\nInactive\nActive or Inactive?\nActive or Inactive?\nActive or Inactive?\nXXX\nXXX\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nconstitutively active\nwild type\nAbl kinase\ndomain\nconstitutively active\nAbl kinase\ndomain\n*H396P mutant\nconstitutively active\nAbl kinase\ndomain\n*H396P mutant\nBcr\nbl\nACTIVE kinase\nA\n*\nGleevec\nuncontrolled cell\nproliferation\n(cancer)\nBcr\nl\nACTIVE kinase\nAb\n*\nmutant\nGleevec\n\nModule 4 and 5 Overview: Gleevec is a blockbuster small molecule drug for chronic\nmyelogenous leukemia (CML) that functions as a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, an aberrant\nkinase implicated in the disease. While most of patients treated with Gleevec in the\nchronic stage of CML experience remission, a significant population eventually develops\nresistance to the drug. A number of point mutations in the gene that encodes the Bcr-Abl\nprotein have been identified in patients with Gleevec-resistant CML. Over the semester\nyou will develop and execute a research plan to 1) determine whether a selected mutation\n(H396P) in the BCR-ABL gene confers Gleevec resistance using an in-vitro kinase assay,\n2) explore the efficacy of an alternative Bcr-Abl inhibitor, Dasatinib, on the wild-type\nand mutant kinases, 3) evaluate crystal structures to understand the mechanism(s) by\nwhich Bcr-Abl mutations block drug activity, and 4) use site-directed mutagenesis to\ncreate an another Gleevec-resistant Abl mutant of your choice.

Insect cells yield _______gram quantities of protein, but are time\nconsuming and _______________ to maintain.\n- in bacteria with very low yields (______grams). While biochemical studies can\nbe carried out with tiny amounts of protein, milligram quantities are required\nfor biophysical and ______________ studies, such a crystallography and NMR.\n\nThe low yields of soluble Abl in E. coli may be due to the ____________ of Tyr kinase\nactivity in bacteria.\n- Phosphatase co-expression prevents high levels of toxic kinase activity.\n- YopH is a non-selective Tyr phosphatase, meaning it dephosphorylates most\nphosphotyrosine (____) substrates, regardless of the specific sequence.\n- Yields of purified Abl K domain protein using the co-expression method in\nBL21-DE3 cells range from ___ to ____ mg/L.\nPROTEIN PURIFICATION\nIn Session 5 you will lyse (split open) your BL21-DE3 cells and isolate the H396P Abl\nprotein.

Affinity tag purification.\nIn affinity tag purification, the protein of interest (______) is expressed with a\npolypeptide affinity tag on the N- or C-terminus of the protein.\nPurification is based on the highly ____________ interaction between the polypeptide\naffinity tag and a binding counterpart that is immobilized on solid support.\nPOI\nPOI = Protein of interest\nTag\nColumn\nTags are introduced at the _______ level, either supplied by the expression vector or\nusing primers.\nFor a summary of sequence, size, matrices, and elution conditions of commonly-used\naffinity tags, see Terpe, K. Appl. Microbio. Biotech. 2003, 60, 523-533.\nA) CHARACTERISTICS OF AFFINITY TAGS\nAn ideal affinity tag\n- requires a simple purification process that is free of harsh reagents.\n- does not affect (or only minimally affects) the tertiary structure and biological\n_______________ of the POI.\n- can be easily and specifically _______________ from the POI following\npurification to produce native protein.\n- can be used with diverse types of proteins.\nSome tags confer additional benefits, such as increasing protein solubility and\nincreasing the yield of recombinant proteins.\n\nSMALL PEPTIDE TAGS\nExamples: poly-Arg, FLAG, poly-His, Strep\nAdvantages:\n- _______________ interference with the fused protein\n- Depending on the location and amino acid composition of the tag, removal of\na small tag may ________ be required.\n- Small tags are far less immonogenic than larger tags, so tagged recombinant\nproteins can be used directly as antigens in antibody production.\nLARGE PEPTIDE TAGS\nExamples: GST, MBP\n- Advantage- These tags can increase solubility and expression of the POI.\n- Disadvantage- In most cases, large tags need to be removed after purification.\nConsiderations for selecting the best fusion system for a protein of interest include\n- Properties of the target protein, such as stability, hydrophobicity, etc.\n- The expression system.
