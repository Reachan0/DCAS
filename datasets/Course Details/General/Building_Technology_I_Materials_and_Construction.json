Architects should specify products that\nmeet ANSI/HPVA HP-1 or comply with US HUD formaldehyde requirement. (see\nthe American Institute of Architects: Environmental Resource Guide). All glulams\nuse adhesives that contain formaldehyde, although resorcinol-formaldehyde and\nphenol-resorcinol formaldehyde are considered safe. Urea formaldehyde is not.\n-\nPreservatives, while not proven to cause health hazards, should be completely\nisolated from the interior spaces of buildings. Try to avoid using preservatives\naltogether. Good detailing can mitigate most weathering issues.\n-\nTrapped moisture from green wood can promote mold growth within an exterior\nenvelope assembly. Good exterior wall analysis will prevent many moisture\nproblems.\n\nPart IV: Resource Efficiency and other sustainable issues\nIssues\n3.\nEnergy\n-\nEnergy comparisons (in the US) between various materials shows that wood is\nvery resource efficient (units omitted, only relative energy costs shown). For\nexample, aluminum requires 126 % more energy than wood.\n-\nIn addition, using fast growing trees (reaching maturation within 20 years; southern\npine, poplar) it is possible to remove more carbon from the environment than one\nhas released in the amount of energy used to harvest and produce lumber\n-\nHowever, there is a great deal of material waste in the production of standardized\nsections for construction. The production of 2 x 4s from a single log will result in\nabout 35% waste wood, in the form of shavings, unusable sections, sawdust and\nchips.\nType of Wall\nEnergy\nPlywood siding, no sheathing, 2 x 4s\n1.988\nMDF siding, plywood sheathing, 2 x 4s\n2.541\nAluminum siding, plywood sheathing, 2 x 4s\n4.953\nMDF siding, plywood sheathing, steel studs\n5.106\nConcrete building block (cmu), no insulation\n17.087\nBrick veneer over sheathing\n17.887\nWOOD\n\nWOOD\nPart IV: Resource Efficiency and other\nsustainable issues\nIssues\n4.\nProduction - Rating Councils: Certification is rare\nand not particularly reliable outside of the United\nStates\n-\nISO 14001 (ISO)\n-\nSustainable Forestry Initiative Standard\n(SFI)\n-\nCanada's National Sustainable Forest\nManagement System (CSA)\n-\nThe American Tree Farm Program (ATF)\n-\nThe Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\nHowever:\n-\nOnly about 1% of the world's wood\nresources are certified (US is net\nimporter of wood)\n-\nEnforcement of foreign sources of wood\nis close to impossible\n-\nTagging certification strategies are\nproblematic on many fronts\n5.\nSustainable Practices\n-\nSee article\n-\nSimply do not specify \"exotic\" woods\n(mahogany, teak, ebony, anigre)\n-\nSeek out sources of recovered,\n\"reclaimed\" wood (James Cutler, Gates\nhouse)\n-\nSpecify glulams, lvls, osb, non-\nformaldehyde plywood (more resource\nefficient production), mdf and engineered sections\nand structural composite\n\nWOOD\nPart IV: Resource Efficiency and other sustainable issues\nMore Sources of information\nPrecede 2-9 with www.\n1.\nEnvironmental Resource Guide, American Institute of Architects (Rotch\nLibrary)\n2.\nEngineered wood products: advanced\nbuildings.org/main_t_building_engineered_wood.htm\n3.\nFormaldehyde-free mdf: advanced\nbuildings.org/main_t_finishes_formaldehyde.htm\n4.\nSustainable and uncommon wood species:\nsustainablebusiness.com/html/insider/jan00/wood.cfm\n5.\nNational Resources Defense Council: nrdc.org/cities/building/rwoodus.asp\n6.\nForest Protection and wood-efficient design: rca-info.org/bldg.html\n7.\nBuilding reuse: smartgrowth.org/casestudies/Presidio.html\n8.\nMid-Atlantic consortium of recycling and economic development:\nlibertynet.org/macredo/crrprj.htm\n9.\nSustainable materials source; engineered sheet materials (OSB etc.):\ngreenbuilder.com/sourcebook/EngSheet.html"

Fernandez\nADVANCED FACADES\nCONSTRUCTION &\nMATERIALS\nDesign and Construction\n-\nInsulation: insulation must be installed as a continuous layer to be effective as calculated. It has been\nestimated that gaps in insulation account for 6% of overall envelope area in commercial buildings. This\ndiscontinuity can amount to 33% additional heat loss. Thermal bridges and impossible insulating details\nare systemic problems of the building industry.\n-\nThermal capacity: by storing excess heat in winter and absorbing heat gains in summer, to be\nrejected using free-cooling techniques during the night.\n-\nAirtightness: Very large amounts of energy is lost through air leakage. In addition to the energy loss,\nair leakage is also the primary source of water condensation in the exterior envelope assembly,leading to\ndurability problems. Measurements have shown that air leakage can typically move 100 times more\nmoisture into an envelope assembly than would occur by diffusion alone. Also, air leakage can contribute\nto problems of indoor air quality (IAQ) from the unfiltered air. Finally, air leakage contributes to uneven\ntemperatures within the building and can lead to complaints of draughts and difficulties in achieving\nuniform indoor temperatures.\n-\nEnvelope Details to serve above: Details that address the coordination of the trades and the\nspecific areas most often cited as problems points should be carefully considered by the architect and\nthen followed up by the contractor. The following are suggestions to achieve these goals:\n1.\nInclusion of air locks at entries\n2.\nDuring Design Development (Detail Design) the line of barrier materials, air and water, should be\ncompletely traced by the design team. Any discontinuities should be addressed.\n3.\nQuality assurance: At completion, both air leakage testing and thermographic imaging may be\nundertaken to assure the owner of a well-built wall.\nHVAC Strategies for Well-\nInsulated Airtight Buildings\nTM29:2002\nCIBSE, Department of Trade\nand Industry: DTI\n\nADVANCED FACADES\nCONSTRUCTION &\nMATERIALS\nMIT: Department of Architecture: Building Technology Program\ncopyright John E. Fernandez\nMasonry Walls\n-\nInsulation:\n-\nthermal bridging occurs primarily at door\nand window interfaces. Continuous sealant\nand proprietary cavity closures (as part of\nwindow and door assembly) are necessary\nhere.\n-\nThermal capacity:\n-\nAs a result of the non-structural nature of\nmuch of masonry construction, its use as a\nthermal capacity material is limited.\n-\nAirtightness:\n-\nInner wythe usually serves as air barrier, although\ngypsum board or finish plaster may also serve\nsuch a function. (Problems above dropped\nceilings when finish is not continuous).\n-\nContinuous mortar beds and end joints standard.\n-\nEnvelope Details to serve above:\n-\nPre-formed insulted lintels should be used over\nwindow and door openings in cavity masonry\nconstruction.\n-\nCavity closures should be incorporated whenever\nthe cavity is interrupted.\n\nADVANCED FACADES\nCONSTRUCTION &\nMATERIALS\nMIT: Department of Architecture: Building Technology Program\ncopyright John E.

However, PCMs may change this.\n-\nAirtightness:\n-\nDue to differential movement between the\nlightweight cladding and the adjacent materials,\nneed to insure continuity of a membrane material\n(most commonly EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene-\nterpolymer).\n-\nEnvelope Details to serve above:\n-\nSealant details and continuity of membranes\ncritical.\n\nMIT: Department of Architecture: Building Technology Program\ncopyright John E.

Claims of energy consumption savings of 30% have NOT\nbeen verified.\n2.\nUS office standards call for deeper perimeter office depths (15-20m typical) than in Europe (7m)\nmaking cross ventilation difficult.\n3.\nUS humidity levels, especially in the East, Midwest and South may make the use of natural\nventilation through DSFs difficult. Also a potential problem with chilled ceilings.\n4.\nCost premium of the wall can be in excess of 200-300% of a typical insulated curtainwall. With\nrealistic payback periods of 20 or so years, the capital costs are currently prohibitive for large\nscale use. Even in Europe, these technologies require substantial subsidies.\n5.\nUsually better, less expensive ways exist to reduce energy consumption.\n6.\nDifficult to shift load to account for large swings in populations. For example theater audiences.\n7.\nSystems call for heightened control monitoring and careful adjustments made within an\nintegrated strategy.

PLANNING: MIT\nMASONRY DETAILING\nSCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING: MIT\nMASONRY DETAILING\n\nDrainage Wall\n- Water travels down back side of outer wythe,\ncollected on flashing, and channeled to exterior\nthrough weep holes\n- Examples:\n- Cavity walls\n- Masonry veneer walls\n- Rain screen walls\nSCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING: MIT\nMASONRY DETAILING\nSCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING: MIT\nMASONRY DETAILING\n\nDrainage Walls Requirements\n- 2 to 4 1⁄2 inch clear\ncavity\n- Flashing and weep\nholes to channel out\nexcessive water\nSCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING: MIT\nMASONRY DETAILING\nSCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING: MIT\nMASONRY DETAILING\n\nRain Screen Wall\n- Equalizes pressure within cavity\n- Vents at top and bottom of wall or panel\n- Flashing and weep holes\n- Compartmentalized\n- Allows for ventilation and evaporation\nSCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING: MIT\nMASONRY DETAILING\nSCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING: MIT\nMASONRY
