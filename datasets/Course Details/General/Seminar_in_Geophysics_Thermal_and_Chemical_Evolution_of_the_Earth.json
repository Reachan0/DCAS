  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 2.5 hours / session\n\nOverview\n\nThese are exciting times for studies of the structure, composition, and evolution of Earth's deep interior. Seismic imaging, geodynamical modeling, and noble gas analyses have provided spectacular new insight in the nature and scale of mantle convection. But despite the increased understanding and consensus within research groups there are significant outstanding issues, whose resolution requires cross-disciplinary study.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe main objective of this cross-disciplinary course is to understand the historical development and the current status of ideas and models, to present and question the constraints from the different research fields, and to investigate if and how the different views on mantle flow can be reconciled with the currently available data.\n\nFormat\n\nEach week faculty members will lecture on the basic physics and chemistry pertinent to the topic of that particular week. These lectures will be followed by literature discussions under leadership of (groups of) students. In this way we aim to cover the basic science as well as digest a substantial fraction of the pertinent literature; the group structure stimulates student interaction and helps reducing communication problems that often complicate cross-disciplinary discussion.\n\nStudents work together in small (less than 4 students) cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional teams in order to improve the understanding and communication of multidisciplinary topics. The groups participate in the following activities:\n\nEvery week, one group is responsible for summarizing the faculty/staff lecture and the related discussions and for preparing material that can be posted on-line;\n\nEvery week, two (other) groups have a reading assignment (one or more papers, depending on length and difficulty) on the topic of the faculty/staff lecture. The students read and discuss the material; the student closest to the topic at hand (e.g., geochemistry) often has to educate his/her fellow students (who may be more familar with concepts of, say, seismology, mineral physics, or geodynamics) - and they present a 15 min summary to the rest of the class.\n\nThere is a mid-term assignment for the groups, which consists of summarizing the issues discussed during the first half of the semester and of working on a small research problem.\n\nThe final assignment takes the form of writing a \"research proposal\"; for this the students taking the class for credit need to reflect on the class, identify which problems are still open, and propose a research project that would address one or more of them.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNone.\n\nGrading\n\nGrades will depend on quality of the mid-term and final assignments, the group presentations, the lecture notes, and general participation in the discussions, and they are determined in a final meeting of all staff responsible for the class.",

And there is a sharp\nH-diffusion-controlled boundary between\nolivine and wad. while in anhydrous system\nwad. Grains appear evenly distributed.\n\n- Hydrous wad. is ~ 5% more dense than\nanhydrous olivine. In a hydrous system\nconsisting mainly of olivine + wad. over a\ndepth of 20 km, gravitational equilibrium\ncan be approached by diffusion of H\nwithout the much slower movement of Fe,\nwhich can sharpen the boundary (perhaps\nto 4 km or less).\n\n- Estimation of Some parameters that\nmight constrain the diffusion effect:\n1. The velocity of diffusion will constrain H\ndistribution equilibrium.\nH diffusion coefficients in solid-state, single crystal\nolivine: ~ 10-8 - 10-9 m2/s (1400oC) Æ large enough\nto allow H distribution equilibrium over a 20 km\ninterval in a few hundred million years.\nIf consider the grain boundaries effect, H\ndistribution equilibrium over 10 km interval will be\na few ten million years.\n2. the estimation of driving forces for establishment\nof gravitational equilibrium\n\nConclusions\n- 1. Under near saturated conditions, the pressure\nof transition is 0.5 - 1.5 GPa lower under\nanhydrous conditions. And the two-phase interval\nbroadens from 0.4 GPa (12 km) in the anhydrous\nsystem to 1.3 GPa (40 km) in the water-saturated\nsystem.\n- 2. H content is the largest chemical difference\nbetween olivine and wad.\n- 3. H diffusion controls the spatial distribution of\nthe olivine and wad. phases and may cause\nsharper boundary at 410 km."

      "content": "NOTES FROM JEREMY BLOXHAM'S LECTURE, 24 FEB, 2005\nCore thermodynamics and the geodynamo\nTrying to find the heat engine for the outer core to produce a magnetic field in a way that\nfits our observations in very difficult, even with the few constraints that are known.\nKnown:\n- temperature at the CMB (from melting curves)\n- geodynamo is generated by the core\n- density jump at the inner core boundary (ICB)\nEnergy balance equation of the core:\nQ=∫hdV -∫Cp DT\ndt dV ∫T DP\nDt dV (1)\nwhere Q is the heat flux from the CMB, the first term on the RHS are the heat sources,\nQR, the second term is the cooling, and the third term is the pressure heating. The cooling\nterm consists of QS, the volumetric cooling, and QL, the freezing at the ICB; the pressure\nheating term consists of QP, the volumetric pressure heating, and QPL, the pressure effect\non freezing.\nThe RHS of eqn (1) is notably missing any term describing the magnetic field, even\nthough the energy generated is used to drive the geodynamo. Thus, to get a magnetic\nfield term we need to look at the entropy balance, by taking each term of the energy\nbalance equation and dividing by T:\n∫1\nT h-Cp dT\ndt T DP\ndt T -Tc\nT\ndV =∫\nT dV ∫K ∇T\nT\n\ndV (2)\nPressure increases with time\ndue to contraction due to\ncooling\nT\nradius\nT\nradius\nTemperature effect on IC\nPressure effect on IC\nTm\nTa1\nTa2\nTa\nTm1\nTm2\nTa = adiabat\nTm = melting curve\nr1\nr2\nr1\nr2\n\nThe LHS describes the entropy changes due to heat sources. The term (TTc)/T is the\nefficiency factor. The first term of the RHS is E, the ohmic and viscous dissipation,\nand the second term is EK, K the thermal conductivity (diffusion term).\nFrom both equations (1) and (2), we get the simplified form:\n\nQ = QR + QS + QL + QP + QPL = Ah + B dTc\ndt\n(3)\nwhere A is the internal heating and the second term is the rate of change of the\ntemperature at the CMB. Similarly,\nEK + E = ER + ES + EL + EP + EPL = Ch + D dTc\ndt\n(4)\nEK can be estimated and is in the range of 200 - 500 MW/K.

The problem is\ninvestigated from two endmember situations:\n1) No cooling:\ndTc\ndt\n= 0\n2) No internal heating: h = 0\nFor the first case of no cooling, Q = 31.4 TW, which is 75% of the total heat flux of the\nearth, and requires h = 16 x 1012 W/kg. QK = 8.6 TW, conduction up the adiabat. This is\nnot a realistic situation, for 75% of the earth's heat flow to come from the core. For the\nsecond case, Q = 20.5 TW, which is 50% of the total heat flux, a more reasonable\nestimate but still unlikely. In addition, if no internal heating of the core is assumed, the\nage of the inner core is only 254 Ma. Once the cooling effect of the inner core is\nremoved, the heat flow becomes Q = 28.8 TW and the cooling rate becomes very large,\n565 K/Ga, which leads to a \"thermal disaster\" in earth's earlier history.\n\nTake home message: it's very hard to run a thermally driven dynamo. If we try to drive\nthe dynamo by thermal convection, it will lose most of the heat before it does much for\nthe dynamo. Therefore, see if chemical variations do a better job of driving the\ngeodynamo:\nTo maintain the entropy requirement for dynamo, we need to maintain the convection\nQ = 8.6 TW (Cooling) at the rate of 70 K /Gyr\n= 12.5 TW (Heating)\nThis will give the age of inner core to be 638 Myr (too young!)\nSuggestion: To check the effect of trace elements on entropy balance\nInner core: (Fe + Ni) + (8% Si/S)\nOuter core: Fe + 8% S/Si + 8% O\nQg : gravitational rearrangement of oxygen in the outer core\nQH: Change in the internal energy from gradual dilution of outer core with oxygen\nLHS of entropy balance\nEα: Dissipation associated with molecular diffusion\nEg: Entropy of gravitational energy relaease\n\nMain Conclusions and Discussion:\n50% of entropy requirement comes from gravitational energy changes caused by\nexpulsion of oxygen at ICB with only 15% of heat flux\nInner core is 300 - 1800 Myr old\nTo make it more old (3.5 Gyrs) we need to add some heat sources, probably potassium.\nAdding potassium can satisfy following:\nPresent day inner core\nHeat Flux (20% from core)\nMantle temperature + Cooling\nSufficient Entropy Production\nNOTE: (1) There was discussion on incorporation of potassium in the core...

      "content": "EARTH'S GEOCHEMISTRY\n(Summary of lecture by Stein Jacobsen on 15 Feb 2005 -\nGroup 3)\nFrom planetary formation models we know that the solar system formed as the solar\nnebula collapsed to form a disk around the protosun. As the temperature of the gas and\ndust in the nebula cooled, different chemical elements condensed progressively. The\nelements that condense at a higher temperature are called refractory and condense first as\nthe solar nebula collapses and cools. The elements that condense last (lower\ntemperatures) are called volatile elements. A large collection of meteorites have been\navailable for scientists to study. There are two main groups: primitive and differentiated.\nPrimitive meteorites are called chondrites. Differentiated meteorites include achondrites,\nirons and stony irons. Solar atmosphere abundances are practically the same as for CI\nmeteorites (a type of chondrite), except for a few elements such as N, C, O (volatiles lost\nby meteorites), Li and B (lost to nuclear reactions in the sun). CAIs (calcium aluminum\nrich inclusions) occur in some meteorites. Since CAIs have the highest condensation\ntemperature of minerals, they are the earliest minerals formed.\nOXYGEN IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nOxygen has various isotopes like O17 and O18. There are two trends in the graph\nshowing the isotopic composition in the solar system: the terrestrial fractionation line that\nhas a slope of 0.5 where the Earth and the Moon lie; and a second line where the\ncarbonecous chondrites lie. The fact that the Earth and moon have the same Oxygen\nisotope ratios may have an interesting implication. If the moon is composed of the debris\nof the impactor in the Moon-forming event (as dynamical models have suggested), this\nimpactor must have formed relatively close to the Earth (within the orbit of Mars).\nACCRETION\nThere are two types of theories for planet accretion: a homogenous accretion, where the\nmaterial accreted and then differentiated; and a heterogeneous accretion where the planet\naccreted from heterogeneous material and differentiated simultaneously as it accreted.\nData favors the heterogeneous accretion theory suggesting that the Earth went through\nthree main stages. This is shown in the figure that shows the depletion relative to CI and\nrefractory elements as a function of increasing siderophile (iron-loving) behaviour. It has\nbeen suggested that (80-90% of) the Earth formed from very reducing material (Fe and\nother siderophile elements went into the core). The next 10-20% were more oxidixing\nand all but the most siderophile elements went into the mantle (with siderophile elements\ngoing into the core). The last stage (0.4%) is the late veneer where all the siderophile\nelements remained in the mantle due to the very oxidizing conditions. In the graph, the\n\nmost siderophile elements are all very similarly depleted (they lie on a horizontal line)\nwhich suggests this late addition of these elements.\nK AND U IN THE SOLAR NEBULA\nThe composition of the bulk Earth is calculated from solar nebula condensations for\nrefractory elements. The estimate of the bulk Earth and measurements of the surface of\nthe Earth both indicate that the K/U is about 10^4 to 2x10^4 making it a robust result.\nThe Uranium concentration is less well constrained but a good estimate is about 20 ppb\n+- 5ppb. K/U ~10^4 Th/U ~ 4 (in MORB Th/U ~ 2.6 -> not chondritic, it has\nfractionated)\nOTHER ISOTOPIC SYSTEMS\nThree isotopic systems were reviewed: Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr and 4He-3He. The Sm-Nd system\ncondensates at a very high temperature, therefore it is believed that there is a\nhomogeneous distribution among all objects in the solar system. All three isotopic\nsystems show that the crust of the Earth is enriched in incompatible elements and that\nthere must be a reservoir in the planet that is depleted. It is important to notice that the\nlocation of this reservoir is not constrained by geochemistry."
