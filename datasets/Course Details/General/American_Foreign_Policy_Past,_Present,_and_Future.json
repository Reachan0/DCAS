  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nDiscussions: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. This is an undergraduate course but is open to graduate students.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThe mission of this course is to explain and evaluate past and present United States foreign policies. What caused past U.S. involvement in foreign wars and interventions? Were the results of U.S. policies good or bad? Would other policies have produced better results? Were the beliefs that guided U.S. policy true or false? If false, what explains these misperceptions? General theories that bear on the causes and consequences of U.S. policy are applied to explain and evaluate past and present policies.\n\nThe course covers foreign policy episodes including U.S. involvement in World Wars I and II, the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Korean and Indochina Wars, the 2003 Iraq war, and the 2001-present \"War on Terror.\" Functional topics are also covered: U.S. national security policy, U.S. foreign economic policy, and U.S. policy on human rights and democracy overseas. Finally, we predict and prescribe for the future. What policies should the U.S. adopt toward current problems and crises? Problems discussed include threats posed by Al Qaeda and its affiliates, and by ISIS/ISIL/Islamic State; the potential spread of weapons of mass destruction to states and non-state actors; possible threats emanating from Syria, Iran and Iraq; North Korean nuclear weapons; managing China's rise; the Ukraine/Russia conflict; climate change; threats to global public health; human rights; and more.\n\nCommunications Intensive Requirement\n\nThis is a Communications Intensive (CI) course, and counts toward fulfilling the\nHASS-D\nand\nCI\nrequirements.\n\nCI courses, including 17.40, require 20 pages of writing, require early submission of at least one paper, and include two public speaking exercises in section. Sections normally include 10 or fewer students.\n\nFormat and Requirements\n\nClass Format\n\nThe class has two 1-hour general meetings and one 1-hour discussion section meeting per week. Students are expected to complete required readings before each discussion section meeting and to attend section regularly. Section attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absence from section will be penalized.\n\nSections will include a public speaking exercise in the format of mock presentations to the\nNational Security Council (NSC)\n. You will be asked to frame and defend to the Council a viewpoint on a foreign policy issue.\n\nWriting Requirement\n\nStudents will write two short ungraded papers--a response paper that reacts to a course reading or lecture or class discussion, and a paper summarizing your in-section presentation--and two longer papers on questions arising from the course material. The two ungraded papers each will be two pages long, double spaced. The longer papers will be 8 pages. One 8-page paper assignment asks you to explain a past case of American conduct--what accounts for American behavior? A second 8-page assignment asks you to evaluate a past American policy: was the policy appropriate, or would another policy have produced better results?\n\nQuizzes\n\nTwo short (15 minute) quizzes will be given. Quiz dates are Session #9 and Session #20. You will be asked to answer three short (define-and-identify) questions on each quiz.\n\nFinal Exam\n\nA list of\nstudy questions\nwill be circulated before the final. The final exam questions will be drawn from this list. Students are encouraged to study together to prepare their answers. The final will also include short-answer questions that will not be distributed in advance.\n\nFilms\n\nA couple of optional evening film showings will be organized during the term, on topics to be chosen by acclamation of the class. Topics could include the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, Iraq, nuclear war, or other subjects. Some of the films to be shown include:\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n. Directed by Stanley Kubrick. Black and white, 95 min. 1964.\n\nEye in the Sky\n.

      "content": "AMERICAN INTERVENTIONS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD: AN OVERVIEW\nI. CORE QUESTIONS\nA. How large is the American \"empire\"? Where is it located?\nB. What have been the effects of US interventions on the USA? Have\nthey improved or injured U.S. security? U.S. prosperity?\nC. What have been the effects of US interventions on the target\nsocieties? Have they improved or injured target societies'\nhuman rights? Have they brought democracy? Civil peace?\nD. What caused US interventions? Mainly security or economic\nconcerns?\nE. When is U.S. intervention successful and when does it fail?\nWhat methods of intervention are effective and which are not?\nF. Ethics of intervention: When does the U.S. have a right to\nintervene in other societies' affairs? When does it have an\nobligation to intervene?\nII. THE SPANISH-AMERICAN-FILIPINO WAR, 1898-1902\nA. Background to war.\n1. Recurrent recessions struck the U.S. in 1873-78, 1882-85 and\n1893-97. Some refer to the 1873-1897 era as the \"Long\nDepression.\" It was second in severity only to the Great\nDepression of 1929-41.\n2. Americans believed two economic myths: that China had a large\nmarket; and that one-way export of U.S. goods to this China\nmarket was possible, and would prevent further economic\ndepressions.\n3. Americans believed in 1898 that Europeans were about to\nconquer and partition China; and that the U.S. needed\nmilitary bases in East Asia if it wanted its slice of the\nChina pie. The Philippines could supply such bases.\nB. The costs of the U.S.-Filipino war: 5,000 Americans and 200,000\nFilipinos killed. Some 70,000 US troops were deployed to the\nPhilippines.\nC. Were American perceptions accurate? In fact the China market\nwas minuscule, and one-way trade with China was impossible. The\nUS Asian empire did not prevent future depressions. Moreover,\nUS possession of the Philippines caused unforeseen US-Japan\nconflict, since US measures to defend the Philippines also\nthreatened Japan--an example of the security dilemma at work.\nOh dear.\nIII. US CARIBBEAN INTERVENTIONS, 1900-1934. 10 INTERVENTIONS IN 6\nCOUNTRIES\nA. \"Dollar Diplomacy\" before World War I. Dollar diplomacy was\nactually about U.S. national security (specifically, keeping\nEuropean navies out of the Caribbean), not dollars.\nB. Dominant U.S. motives:\n1. Dollar Diplomacy/security:\n-- Dominican Republic 1916-1924.\n-- Haiti 1915-1934.\n\n-- Nicaragua 1909, 1912.\n2. Other security:\n-- Russia 1918-1920, to support non-communists (an\nintervention in Europe, not the 3rd world, but I toss it\nin).\n3. Economic:\n-- Cuba 1906-1909, 1917--to protect U.S. investors.\n-- Panama 1903--to get a bargain price on canal rights.\n-- Mexico 1913--to protect U.S. investors.\n4. Other:\n-- Nicaragua 1927-32--to contain leftist Mexico.\n-- Mexico 1914--to promote democracy in Mexico.\nThe U.S. Marines fought nasty counter-insurgencies against\nlocals who resented US occupation in Haiti 1915-34, the\nDominican Republic 1916-24, and Nicaragua 1927-32, killing\nseveral thousand people.\nC. Non-intervention: FDR's Good Neighbor Policy, 1934-45.\nIV. COVERT OPERATIONS, 1945-PRESENT\nA. Iran 1953: the CIA instigated a coup against the elected\nMossadeq regime. Britain sought a coup against Mossadeq to\nprotect British oil companies from nationalization by the\nMossadeq government. So Britain fed the U.S. false tales of\ncommunists penetration of Iran and of communist leanings by\nMossadeq. These fables helped spur the U.S. to organize the\n1953 coup. The U.S. then installed a cruel pro-U.S. rightist\ndictatorship under the Shah Reza Pahlavi (1953-1979). In 1979\nthe Shah's regime was overthrown by extremist Shiite mullahs who\nhad been radicalized by the 1953 coup and the Shah's\ndictatorship. These mullahs then established their own cruel\ndictatorship (1979-present) and pursued a fiercely anti-American\nforeign policy.\nB. Guatemala 1954: a CIA coup against the elected leftist Arbenz\nregime. Impetus for the coup came from the United Fruit\nCompany, which opposed Arbenz because he refused to grant UFCo\nsweetheart terms. The coup brought a brutal rightist\ndictatorship to power. Vast horrors followed. Guatemala saw\nperiodic rebellions for the next four decades. The Guatemalan\ngovernment suppressed these rebellions with immense violence\n(200,000 killed). Peace came only in 1996. Guatemala is now a\ndemocracy, but is ridden with murderous street gangs who\nterrorize widely.\nC. Congo 1960: the U.S. (via the CIA) abetted the murder of Patrice\nLumumba, the most popular leader in the newly-independent Congo.\nThe U.S. then supported the rise and rule of the deeply corrupt\nJoseph Mobutu, who brought ruin to Congo. A great civil war,\nstill simmering, followed his downfall. Murdering Lumumba: good\nchoice?\nD. Chile 1970-1973: CIA operations overthrew the elected leftist\nAllende regime. Impetus for the coup came from the CEOs of\nPepsico, ITT, and Kenicott and Anaconda copper. Harsh\ndictatorship followed, 1973-1989, ~2000 Chileans murdered by\n\nPinochet. Democracy restored in 1989.\nE. Other successful operations: Brazil 1964, Greece 1967. Failed\noperations: Cuba 1961, Indonesia 1957, Eastern Europe and China\n1950s, against Saddam's Iraqi regime 1991-2003.\n> Some of these coups, most notably Iran 1953, Guatemala 1954, and\nChile 1973, were done partly to help US and British multinational\ncorporations. Moral: economic motives sometimes drive US foreign\npolicy. It is not all about national security. Question: do\nordinary Americans benefit when the US government helps US\ncorporations operate overseas? Doesn't this promote job flight\nfrom the US?\n> Possible moral: covert operations are effective against\ndemocracies but useless against tyrannies. US operations against\nCuba, the USSR, China and Iraq all failed.\n> Question: what about assassination as a U.S. policy? Ever a good\nidea? E.g., against Saddam Hussein during 1991-2003? Or Hitler\n1933-45?\nV. DIRECT MILITARY INTERVENTIONS IN OTHERS' INTERNAL AFFAIRS, 1945\nPRESENT\nA. Eight direct interventions, 1945-89.\n1.\nVietnam/Indochina 1961-1973.\n2.\nDominican Republic 1965.\n3-4. Grenada 1983; Panama 1989.\n5-8. Germany, Japan, Italy, Austria, 1941-1945. These\ninterventions had striking democratic and peace-causing\nresults.\nB. Twelve direct interventions, 1989-present.\n1. Four 1990s interventions: Somalia 1992-93; Haiti 1994; Bosnia\n1995; Kosovo 1999. Observers disagree on whether these were\nsuccesses or failures. The Somali intervention probably\nsaved ~20,000 lives and cost 42 U.S. lives. Haiti remains a\nmess. Kosovo is quiet but Bosnia remains a powder keg.\n2. Two 2000s interventions: Iraq 2003-2011; Afghanistan 2001\npresent. U.S. losses in Iraq: 4,477 U.S. dead, 30,000\nwounded, many badly. In Afghanistan: 2200+ U.S. dead so far.\nThese wars illustrate that counter-insurgency (COIN) is hard!\nIraq is now widely deemed a blunder. No WMD was destroyed.\nAl-Qaeda was boosted. ISIS was spawned. Two public\nmisperceptions fueled the war: that Saddam was involved with\nthe 9/11/01 attack, and Saddam had WMD. Both false.\n3. Six interventions by drone, airpower: Yemen, Somalia,\nPakistan against al-Qaeda affiliates; Libya 2011; Iraq and\nSyria against ISIS today.\nC. A Non-Intervention: Rwanda 1994. 800,000 were murdered.\nD. Intervention issues, regarding four main intervention missions:\ndemocratization, regime change, pacifying societies in conflict,\nand defeating insurgencies.\n1. Re: democratization:\n> When does imposing democracy require long occupation? Long\noccupations were needed in Germany, Japan, Italy, Austria,\n\nbut not in Panama or Grenada.\n> When is democratization impossible, even with a long\noccupation? Intense poverty and illiteracy usually\npreclude democracy. Deep ethnic divisions also impede\ndemocracy. These conditions cannot be easily cured. Hence\nsome argue that these problems preclude democracy in Haiti,\nSomalia, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and perhaps\nEgypt.\n2. Re: Regime change:\n> The most organized elements dominate politics after regime\nchanges, not the most popular elements.\n> The most organized elements are often the most extreme\nelements.\n> Ergo: regime change often brings worse monsters to power\nunless the US occupies the target state.\n3. Re: preventing/dampening/ending civil war:\n> When do deep social divisions preclude civil peace? Some\nargue that deep ethnic divisions prime Iraq, Afghanistan,\nSomalia and Syria for civil war.\n> Does the US government know how to dampen or end civil\nwars?\n4. Re: defeating insurgencies:\n> The US military is very good at fighting the regular forces\nof states, but bad at COIN. COIN is essentially police\nwork, alien to the ethos of the U.S. military services, and\nrequiring skills and assets, especially knowledge of local\nlanguage and culture, that U.S. forces often lack.\n> When will U.S. intervention require U.S. counter-insurgency\n(COIN), as in Vietnam 1965-73 and Iraq 2003-11? When and\nhow can insurgency be avoided, as in Germany, Japan, Italy,\nand Austria after 1945, Grenada 1983, and Panama 1989? The\nU.S. is bad at COIN and needs to keep such interventions to\na minimum.\nSome argue that the Iraq insurgency of 2003-2011 was\ninevitable. Others say it was avoidable, and stemmed from\nU.S. blunders: entering Iraq with a fairly small invasion\nforce, failing to provide security following the invasion,\ndisbanding the Iraqi Army in spring 2003, and unduly broad\nde-Ba`athification of the state, which amounted to de-\nSunnification and so provoked the Sunnis.\n> COIN often degenerates into brutal operations against\ncivilians that include widespread torture and murder, as\nboth insurgents and counterinsurgents compete to coerce\ncooperation from civilians.\n> Nine keys to success in COIN:\na. Good intelligence, as COIN is largely police work (as\nnoted above), not war.\nb. Avoiding injury to innocents. This requires good\nintelligence; and very restrictive rules of engagement for\nyour troops (\"shoot only when you are sure you will not\nharm civilians\"). Your troops will chafe at strict rules\nof engagement but they are essential to victory.\n\nc. Good communication with the occupied public. Explain\nyour actions, tell your side of the story.\nd. Carrots as well as sticks. Offer economic incentives\n(bribes) for cooperation with your program.\ne. Take steps to ensure that the government you support\nbehaves in ways that cause it to be viewed as legitimate\nby the public. It must deliver services competently and\nfairly. Bush 43 and Obama failed on this score in Iraq,\ntolerating abuse of Sunni populations by the dreadful\nShiite Maliki regime. Hence ISIS grew strong in Sunni\nareas.\nf. A clear-and-hold strategy is far better than a search\nand-destroy strategy.\ng. Get local forces to do the heavy lifting in COIN.\nLocals know the local language and culture and will be far\nbetter at intelligence collection.\nh. Insurgencies are very hard to defeat if they have\nsanctuaries in neighboring countries. Such sanctuaries\nmust be shut down.\ni. Don't let the insurgency start in the first place.\nInsurgencies are like peat fires--very hard to start, very\nhard to stop. The best COIN strategy is to prevent\ninsurgency in the first place.\n> Can mass violence (e.g., killing everyone in rebellious\ndistricts) defeat insurgency? History (e.g., the defeat of\nthe Guatemalan insurgents in the 1980s) suggests yes if the\nviolence is accurately directed at the most rebellious\nareas. But this is not a tool the U.S. can use. If used\ntoday in the Mideast it would further alienate the wider\nMuslim world and bolster al-Qaeda/ISIS.\n> Is torture useful in COIN? Does successful COIN require the\nuse of torture or other violations of the laws of war?\nSummary on direct intervention: US success often requires US\noccupation. But occupation often triggers insurgencies; and\nthe US is bad at counter-insurgency.\nVI. INTERVENTION BY PROXY: PARAMILITARY INTERVENTIONS AND\nINTERVENTIONS BY ASSISTING REGIMES, 1945-PRESENT\nA. Four Reagan Doctrine Wars, 1983-1991.\n1. Nicaragua: the U.S. supported Contra rebels against the\nMarxist Sandinista governments, 1983-90. 50,000 Nicaraguan\ndeaths.\n2. Angola: the U.S. supported UNITA rebels against the Marxist\nMPLA government, 1975-91. 1,000,000 Angolan deaths.\n3. Cambodia: the U.S. supported anti-Hun Sen forces, 1979-89.\n64,000 El Salvadoran deaths.\n4. Afghanistan: the U.S. supported Afghan mujahideen against the\nSoviet invaders, 1980-92. 1,000,000 Afghans killed.\nPossible morals: (1) paramilitary campaigns can have military\nsuccess. The US proxy armies did well in all four wars. (2)\nParamilitary intervention makes a big mess because civil wars\n\ntear up society. Fighting continues to this day in Afghanistan\nand Angola is a mine-ridden ruin, strewn with death and\nsuffering. A million Angolans died in the war of 1975-1991.\nB. Assistance to El Salvador's government, 1979-91. The U.S.\nhelped El Salvador's rightist oligarchs defeat the communist\nFMLN rebellion. 70,000 killed. Democracy has followed since.\nAlso immense criminalization and gang violence, triggering\nrefugee flows to the USA in 2013ff.\nSummary: paramilitary interventions can effectively punish target\nregimes. But is this good? They also often escape US control,\nkilling civilians and otherwise sowing wide unintended chaos and\nruin.\nVII. DIRECT INTERVENTIONS AGAINST INTERNATIONAL AGGRESSION, 1945\nPRESENT\nA. Korea, 1950-present. The U.S. reversed North Korea's aggression\nand deterred any renewed aggression.\nB. The Persian Gulf War, 1990-1991. The US forced Iraq out of\nKuwait.\nPossible moral: the US is good at this kind of intervention. US\narmed forces are well-designed for halting or reversing cross-\nborder aggression.\nVIII. DID U.S. COLD WAR INTERVENTIONS SERVE CONTAINMENT? HOW CAN WE\nTELL?\nIX. CURRENT INTERVENTION ISSUES\nA. Controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\nThis is now a paramount U.S. interest! Consider these\nstrategies:\n1. Denying technology to proliferators--can this still work by\nitself? (No.)\n2. Economic carrots and sticks: (a) threat of economic sanctions\nand (b) bribery for good conduct. Are these measures strong\nenough alone to stem and reverse proliferation?\n3. Provide security for potential proliferators. This worked\nwith Germany, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. But what if the\npotential proliferators are nasty countries hostile to U.S.\nallies? E.g., Saddam's Iraq, Iran, North Korea.\n4. Hold proliferators' nuclear forces at risk. The U.S. would\nlet proliferation happen but be prepared to undo it by\n(nuclear) preventive war. This threat will make\nproliferators behave. It requires a nuclear first- and\nsecond-strike capability. Can such capabilities be gained\nand sustained against such states? Many say it requires\nnational ballistic missile defense. Is this true?\n5. Counter-society deterrence. Threaten to annihilate societies\nthat use nukes recklessly. But will this work after they get\na second strike capability? Will it prevent transfer of\nweapons to terrorists? And is it ethical to threaten to\nmassacre civilians? Children?\n6. Counter-elite deterrence.\n\na. Threaten to annihilate proliferators' elites if they use\nor transfer nukes recklessly.\nb. Establish the principle that all governments must pay\ndamages to anyone injured by their WMD. Face\nproliferators with the risk of immense lawsuits if they\nlose control of their WMD to terrorists or others. Will\npossessing WMD then be so fashionable?\n7. Regime change by subversion or economic strangulation\n(including by blockade) or air strike.\n8. Sabotage and/or disruption. Unleash destructive cyber-\nattacks on the proliferator's installations (for example\nStuxnet). Assassinate its nuclear scientists (as someone has\nkilled some Iranian scientists).\n9. Preventive war (either limited or total):\na. Conventional preventive war, e.g., Israel against Iraq in\n1981, Syria in 2007. This was Bush 41 administration\npolicy, as framed in the 2002 U.S. national security\nstrategy. Possible candidates for future action include\nIran, North Korea, Syria, and maybe more.\nb. Nuclear preventive war--a more frightening idea.\n10. Tolerate some proliferation; deter proliferators from\nmisusing their weapons.\nQuestion: How can the U.S. justify denying WMD to others while\nmaintaining thousands of nuclear weapons itself?\nB. Interventions against terror networks, as in Afghanistan 2001\nand ISIS today in Iraq/Syria/Libya. US options:\n1. Intimidate terror-harboring regimes into controlling their\nown terrorists. Is that sufficient? Or ...\n2. Oust terror-harboring regimes and replace them with regimes\nthat will police their terrorists (as the US did in\nAfghanistan in 2001).\n3. Oust terror-provoking regimes (Assad in Syria, Maliki in\nIraq) and replace them with pluralist regimes.\n4. Broker an end to civil wars that feed terrorist networks, as\nin Syria and Iraq today.\n5. Build up the militaries of states, (e.g., Afghanistan,\nSomalia, Congo, Syria, Iraq) so they can police their own\nterritory, eradicate terrorist havens. Is the U.S. good at\ndoing this? (No.)\n6. Intervene directly against terror networks in hostile or\nfailed states, bypassing the government. This was 2009 Biden\nPlan for Afghanistan; and is the 2014ff Obama approach to\nISIS.\nC. War prevention: If the U.S. doesn't prevent or halt distant wars\nwill they spread to involve the U.S.? Also, will terrorists\nfeed on distant wars if the U.S. doesn't halt or prevent them\n(as al-Qaeda fed on the Afghan civil war)? But if the U.S.\ntries try to prevent wars, will it succeed? (Does it know how?)\nAnd if the U.S. doesn't will it get sucked into wars it could\notherwise avoid?\nD. Human rights. Should the U.S. undertake humanitarian\ninterventions to stop gross human rights violations, e.g.: the\n\n1994 genocide in Rwanda; the horrors in Sudan (including Darfur)\nsince 1983; the current mass killings in Syria, Congo, South\nSudan, Central African Republic, Burundi, Burma?\nGeneral background questions that are relevant:\n-- Has the U.S. done good for others when it intervened overseas\nin the past? If not will it do better in the future?\n-- Is the U.S. state, or any state, good at performing\nphilanthropies--especially abroad? Will governments do more\nharm than good when they are not accountable to those\naffected by their actions, as when they intervene in others'\naffairs?\n-- Are societies entitled to shape one another when they \"know\nbetter\" than the other--or do societies have a right to\ncommit their own crimes and blunders?\n-- Does the U.S. have a duty to help others? At what discount\ndo we value others' lives? How many Sudanese, or Afghans,\nare worth one American?\n-- What instruments of intervention are legitimate? Covert\naction? Economic sanctions? Assassination?\nE. Democracy: is democracy good for everyone? Can the US export it\nsuccessfully?\nF. Defending America's cultural/historic kin: Israel, South Korea,\nPhilippines. Who do Americans owe, and what do Americans owe\nthem?\nG. Miscellaneous: drugs (Mexico today), migrants (Haiti 1994).\nX. WHO FAVORS INTERVENTION TODAY?\nThe U.S. has intervened abroad repeatedly since the Cold War ended\n(1989) under both Democratic and Republican administrations.\nPresident George H.W. Bush intervened in Panama, Kuwait/Iraq, and\nSomalia. President Bill Clinton remained in Somalia, and\nintervened in Bosnia, Kosovo, and (indirectly) Haiti. President\nGeorge W. Bush intervened in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia.\nPresident Obama expanded the intervention in Afghanistan,\nintervened in Libya and Syria, and re-intervened in Iraq. In the\nTrump administration interventionists Mike Pompeo and Tom Cotton\nare ascendant, but the less interventionist James Mattis remains\npowerful. Overall the orientation of the Trump administration\ntoward intervention remains unclear.\nNeoconservative foreign policy thinkers are the strongest\nadvocates of interventions today, especially in the Mideast. They\nhold large influence in Washington.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n17.40 American Foreign Policy: Past, Present, Future\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "COLD WAR ORIGINS, & U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE KOREAN WAR\nI. HOW THE COLD WAR ERUPTED: EVENTS\nA. Background: President Franklin Roosevelt (FDR) hoped to\ncontinue collaborating with the Soviet Union after World War\nII. FDR's plan for peace: The five major powers (U.S.,\nBritain, France, the USSR and China) would cooperate to keep\npeace, as the European great powers did after 1815.\nB. Conflict over Poland, 1944.\n-- Soviet dictator Josef Stalin wanted a communist Poland under\nSoviet control. So he created a communist Polish government\nto rival the non-communist Polish government in exile. This\nirked Western powers who first joined WWII to free Poland.\n-- July 1944: the Soviets encouraged a Polish underground\nrising against the Nazis. Then the Soviet army halted on\nWarsaw's outskirts and let the Nazis slaughter the\nunderground. Stalin refused even to let the U.S. and\nBritain air-drop supplies to them until it was too late.\nNot nice!\nC. Yalta summit, February 1945. Stalin agreed to reorganize the\nPolish government on a more democratic basis and to hold \"free\nand unfettered elections\" in Poland. But FDR agreed to let\nStalin decide how much to reorganize the government, and how\nelections would be run. By conceding control of details to\nStalin FDR in effect conceded on substance. William Leahy, a\ntop FDR aide, warned FDR that \"this [agreement] is so elastic\nthat the Russians can stretch it all the way from Yalta to\nWashington without ever technically breaking it.\" FDR replied:\n\"I know it, Bill ... But it's the best I can do for Poland at\nthis time.\" In short, Yalta was a vague agreement.\nThen FDR oversold the agreement to the U.S. public by\nimplying that Stalin conceded more than in fact he had.\nD. Potsdam summit, July 1945. Stalin demanded territorial\nconcessions in Turkey, Japan, and part of Libya (then an\nItalian colony). Truman refused. Some Americans read Stalin's\ndemands to signal darkly aggressive Soviet intentions.\nE. Stalin's ominous Feb. 9, 1946 speech.

      "content": "THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, OCTOBER 16-28 1962\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 brought the world close\nto nuclear war. Some of President John F. Kennedy's (JFK's)\nadvisers recommended that the US launch a surprise air attack on\nCuban and invade Cuba. This would have led to direct combat\nbetween US forces and Soviet forces. Both sides were armed with\ntactical nuclear weapons. Other advisers counselled Kennedy to\nlaunch preventive general nuclear war against the USSR. During\nthe crisis Cuban dictator Fidel Castro urged the Soviet leaders\nto launch nuclear war against the US if the US invaded Cuba.\nThe world held its breath! What caused this crisis? How close\ndid we come to war? Why did the crisis end peacefully?\nA. The US had nuclear superiority over the USSR in 1962.\nSpecifically, the US had a clear second-strike countervalue\ncapability (the capacity to inflict unacceptable damage on\nSoviet society after absorbing an all-out Soviet surprise\ncounterforce attack) and perhaps also had a first-strike\ncounterforce capability (the capacity to strike first with\nenough force to leave the Soviets unable to inflict\nunacceptable damage in retaliation). The Soviets had a total\nof 42 nuclear-armed ICBMs, of which 36 could be launched on\n15 minute warning; of these, 26 were deployed in hardened\nsilos.1 How many could survive US attack and fly to the\nUS???\n> During 1955-1960 US Air Force leaders argued that the US\nfaced a \"bomber gap,\" and then a \"missile gap,\" in which\nthe Soviets had or were getting a first-strike capability\nover the US. US photo-reconnaissance satellites verified\nthe reverse--that the US had nuclear superiority--in 1960.\nUS knowledge of its superiority was revealed to the public\nand the Soviets in a press briefing by Roswell Gilpatrick\non October 21, 1961. Until then Soviet leaders probably\nthought the US (1) believed Soviet forces were vastly\nlarger than they were; and (2) didn't know where Soviet\nforces were, hence couldn't target them. The Gilpatrick\nbriefing likely came as a great shock to Soviet leaders.\nB. The US plotted Castro's downfall, 1959-1962. US actions: a\n\"covert\" invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, 1961; Operation\nMongoose and its planned Cuban uprising, 1961ff; and the\nPhibriglex exercise, 1962, to liberate a Caribbean island\nfrom the dictator \"Ortsac.\" US overthrow efforts were inept\nbut serious in intent. They convinced Castro that a US\ninvasion was inevitable.\n1 Michael Dobbs, One Minute to Midnight (Vintage, 2007):\n190.\n\nC. The US sent nuclear-armed intermediate-range ballistic\nmissiles (IRBMs) to Britain, Italy and Turkey, 1957-1962.\nII. THE SOVIETS SEND MISSILES TO CUBA, MAY-OCTOBER 1962: WHY?\nAND WHY DID THEY DO IT SECRETLY?\nThe Soviets sent the missiles to Cuba ...\nA. To acquire enough nuclear strength to escape the shadow of US\nnuclear superiority?\nB. To deter the US from a feared invasion of Cuba?\nC. To acquire enough nuclear strength to force the US to settle\nthe Berlin crisis in the Soviets' favor?\nD. To humiliate US President John F. Kennedy (JFK)?\nHistorians and Soviet crisis participants interviewed later\nfavor explanations #1 and #2, with focus on #2. A few favor #3.\nIn 1962 JFK's policymakers favored explanation #4.\nNote: the Soviet deployment included 60 nuclear warheads for\nmedium and intermediate-range MRBM and IRBM missiles; 36 IRBMs;\nand 98 tactical nuclear weapons plus short-range Luna (Frog)\nmissiles and Ilyushin 28 Beagle bombers to deliver them. The\nLunas and Beagles were ideal for nuking a US invasion force.\nIII. THE US RESPONSE\nA. JFK warns Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to deploy no\nmissiles in Cuba, Sept. 4 and Sept. 13, 1962.\nB. The Soviet missiles are discovered, Oct. 16. JFK decides\nthey must go. Why?\n1. Fears for US credibility, NATO unity: \"If we cave NATO\nwill collapse!\"\n2. Fears that the missiles would give the Soviets an\nunacceptable military advantage? No: JFK expressed little\nconcern about the military consequences of the Soviet\nmissile deployment.\n3. US domestic politics? Did JFK fear attacks from the right\nif he caved? The White House tapes don't reveal such\nconcerns; and non-elected officials were more hawkish than\nJFK, suggesting that electoral political concerns weren't\ndriving hawkish thinking. But JFK did privately express\nfear of impeachment or defeat in the 1964 election if the\nmissiles stayed in Cuba. \"Kenneth Keating will be the\nnext president.\"\nC. The ExComm considers three options, Oct. 16-Oct. 22:\n1. Quiet diplomacy. Threaten Khrushchev privately while\nmaking no public military moves.\n2. Blockade (\"quarantine\") Cuba. Exclude only missiles and\nwarheads for now, to freeze the military status quo.\nMaybe extend the blockade to cover oil and other items\nlater, if necessary, to strangle Cuba.\n3. A surprise US conventional air strike against the Soviet\nmissiles, followed immediately by a US military invasion\nof Cuba.\nEarly in the crisis JFK and most of his advisors favored\noption #3, Surprise Attack and Invasion. But JFK eventually\n\nchose option #2, Quarantine.\nUS officials didn't come up with the Quarantine idea until\nOct. 19, three days into the crisis. Governments think\nslowly!\nD. JFK's counter-fait accompli: the Quarantine announcement of\nOct. 22.\nIV. SCARY EVENTS AT SEA\nThe Soviets deployed four Foxtrot-class submarines near Cuba\nduring the crisis. Unknown to the US, each sub carried one\nnuclear-armed torpedo. Each was perhaps authorized to use it in\nevent they were attacked.\nThe US devised a system to signal these subs to surface by\nexploding practice depth-charges near the sub, and transmitted\nthis scheme to Moscow during the crisis. Moscow never forwarded\nthis news to the submarine commanders. Hence they interpreted\ndepth-charge explosions not as signals but as an attack meant to\nsink them. One sub commander considered nuking a US destroyer\nin response.2\nV. THE SETTLEMENT\nA. Khrushchev sent JFK a letter on Friday Oct. 26 offering to\nremove Soviet missiles from Cuba in exchange for a US no-\ninvasion pledge regarding Cuba. The next day he sent a\nsecond letter adding a demand: the US must also remove its\nmissiles from Turkey. Oh dear!\nB. JFK's Oct. 27 answer: He ignored the second letter and\npublicly accepted Khrushchev's first offer--a Soviet\nwithdrawal of its missiles from Cuba in exchange for a US\npledge not to invade Cuba. He spiced this acceptance with a\nprivate ultimatum (24 hours to agree or the US would attack\nthe missiles) and sweetened it with a secret concession\n(withdrawal of US missiles from Turkey within six months).\nKhrushchev quickly accepted Kennedy's offer on Oct. 28.\nQuestion: Was the spice in Kennedy's letter smart? The\nsweetener?\nVI. HINGES OF THE CRISIS\nA. US officials feared war at three points:\n-- On October 16-18--at the start of the crisis--when US\nofficials considered launching war.\n-- On October 24, when the U.S. thought Soviet ships were\napproaching the line of US ships blockading Cuba.\n-- On October 27, when Khrushchev seemed to stiffen his\nterms, a Soviet missile shot down a US U-2 over Cuba, and\nCastro's forces began firing on US low-level recon planes.\nB. Two hawk vs. dove disputes occurred in the US government:\n2 Svetlana V. Savranskaya, \"New Sources on the Role of\nSoviet Submarines in the Cuban Missile Crisis,\" Journal of\nStrategic Studies, 28:2: 233-59 at 234-35, 249-51.\n\n-- The bomb-vs.-quarantine debate early in the crisis.\n-- A later debate over whether to trade US Jupiters to get\nSoviet missiles out of Cuba.\nVII. HOW DANGEROUS WAS THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS?\nJFK estimated the risk of war at between 1 in 3 and 1 in 2.\nA. How accurate were perceptions on both sides? Not very!\n1. JFK didn't expect a USSR missile deployment to Cuba.\nThat's why he warned publicly against it--he thought his\nbluff wouldn't be called.\n2. US policymakers didn't see a chief USSR motive for\ndeployment (defend Cuba from invasion). Hence nearly\noverlooked the no-invasion pledge as a solution to the\ncrisis.\n3. Khrushchev didn't expect the US to detect his missile\ndeployment.\n4. US leaders wrongly assumed Khrushchev ordered the Oct. 27\nU2 shootdown.\n5. US leaders underestimated Soviet and Cuban military\ncapabilities in Cuba.\na. The US thought the Soviets had 8,000-10,000 troops in\nCuba. In fact the Soviets had 43,000 troops. Cuba had\nanother 270,000 well-trained troops. The US planned to\ninvade with only 140,000 troops. This war won't end\nwell for the USA!\nb. More interestingly, the US was unaware that the Soviets\nhad 98 tactical warheads and means to deliver them in\nCuba. Wow!\n6. US leaders were unaware:\n> That the four Soviet Foxtrot submarines near Cuba each\ncarried one nuclear-armed torpedo; and were perhaps\nauthorized to use it in event they were attacked.\n> That the commanders of these subs were unaware of the\nUS scheme to signal their subs with practice depth\ncharge explosions. Hence the US used the depth\ncharges.\n7. Castro was unaware of US nuclear superiority. Also,\nCastro thought that the US was bent on invading Cuba. And\n... he urged the Soviet Union to answer a US invasion, if\nit occurred, with nuclear strikes on the US!\n8. JFK was unaware of symmetry of Soviet and US missile\ndeployments. JFK: \"It's just as if we suddenly began to\nput a major number of MRBMs in Turkey. Now that'd be\ngoddam dangerous, I would think.\" McGeorge Bundy and\nAlexis Johnson then explain \"Well, we did, Mr. President.\"\n9. On October 28 Khrushchev thought JFK intended to announce\nthe start of war at 5:00 p.m. that day. Not so.\nB. How tight was central control on military operations? Not\nvery!\n1. The Oct. 27 Soviet shootdown of the US U2 was unauthorized\nby Moscow.\n\n2. US anti-submarine operations were more aggressive than JFK\nknew. Indeed, they were more aggressive and dangerous\nthan the US Navy itself knew. On Oct. 27 the Navy forced\nto the surface a Soviet submarine that, unbeknownst to the\nNavy, carried a nuclear torpedo and was commanded by a\nSoviet officer that feared he was under attack and briefly\nconsidered firing his nuclear torpedo.\n3. A US U2 strayed over Siberia during the crisis. The\nSoviets could have thought this a precursor to a US first\nstrike. The Soviets scrambled fighters to shoot it down;\nthe US scrambled nuclear-armed fighters in response.\n4. US test intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were\narmed with nuclear warheads during the crisis; and a\nscheduled test from this test-field was still conducted.\n5. A US intelligence ship remained close to Cuba early in the\ncrisis--an inviting target.\n6. A pre-planned retaliatory strike was nearly conducted\nafter the Oct. 27 U2 shootdown--another near-oversight.\nC. False warning problems. The US jury-rigged south-directed\nwarning system had a hidden common-mode failure: it would see\na Cape Canaveral launch as a Cuban launch.\nD. Would JFK have pushed matters to war? If forced to decide on\nDay 1, yes. Later, only in extremis. We now know he made a\nplan (the Cordier plan) to agree publicly to withdraw the US\nIRBMs from Turkey if this was necessary to resolve the\ncrisis. But JFK did formulate his last offer/threat as an\nultimatum with a deadline--a risky act.\nE. What if someone else had been President? JFK was markedly\nmore dovish than other US policymakers. Had he not been\nPresident history probably would have been different and more\nexciting. The military favored war. Acheson favored war.\nVII. LATER HISTORICAL REVELATIONS: REVISIONS TO RFK'S ACCOUNT\n-- The Cordier plan. JFK had a hidden plan to pursue a public\nJupiter trade.\n-- The Soviets had nukes in Cuba, including tactical nukes,\ncommanded by officers with predelegated authority to use\nthese weapons at the outset of the crisis. Khrushchev\nwithdrew this authority during the crisis but there is no\nguarantee these weapons would have gone unused in event of\nwar.\n-- The US seriously intended to oust Castro. It was probably\nprovoked the Soviet missile deployment. It also provoked\nCastro to seek nuclear war if Cuba was invaded.\n-- A soviet sub commander considered launching a nuclear weapon\nat a US destroyer.\nVIII. PERSISTING MYSTERIES OF THE CRISIS\n-- Why the rush by the US? The US was in a great rush to\nresolve the crisis, pressing matters at a desperate pace on\nOctober 27, when Kennedy told the Soviets that the US would\n\nuse force unless matters were resolved in a day or two. What\ndrove JFK's sense of urgency?\nWould a longer US blockade of Cuba have succeeded in\npersuading the Soviets to remove their missiles from Cuba?\n-- What US response would have occurred had the Soviets not\naccepted Kennedy's terms on Oct. 28? (Would Kennedy have\nimplemented the Cordier plan? Gone to war?)\n-- What were Soviet and American plans for war if the war\nerupted?\nIX. WHAT CAUSED THE CRISIS? WHY WAS WAR AVOIDED?\nA. Causes: US belligerence toward Cuba? US nuclear superiority?\nSoviet recklessness? Lack of clear \"rules of the game\"? US\ndomestic politics?\n> Re: US belligerence toward Cuba: perhaps the US could have\navoided the crisis by leaving Castro's regime alone.\n> Re: US superiority: there are some capabilities one does\nnot want to have.\n> Re: US domestic politics:\n> Soviet missiles in Cuba did not give the USSR a first-\nstrike capability; and added little to Soviet second-\nstrike capability.\n> The Soviets could and did greatly expand their second-\nstrike capability during the next 12 months by deploying\nICBMs in the USSR. So any second-strike benefit to the\nUSSR would be brief; and any harm to the US would be\ndelayed only a year.\n> JFK said he warned the Soviets against deploying any\nmissiles in Cuba on Sept. 4 and 13 because the Soviets\nhad told him they wouldn't deploy any. He would have set\na higher ceiling had he thought the Soviets were\ndeploying.\n> Implication: the crisis was caused by JFK's public\nwarnings of Sept. 4 and 13, and the domestic political\nrisk these warnings created for JFK. The real military\nstakes were trivial.\n> Further implication: did nuclear war almost happen to\nsave JFK's political skin?\nB. Did JFK and Khrushchev bring the world close to nuclear war\nover trivial issues?\n> Soviet missiles in Cuba were not militarily very important.\nThe Soviets achieved a second-strike countervalue\ncapability using forces based in the USSR about 18 months\nafter the missile crisis (in spring 1964). Was Khrushchev\nwise to take huge risks just to try to advance this event\nby a few months? Was JFK wise to risk war in response?\n> US missiles in Turkey were not militarily important. Yet\nboth JFK and Khrushchev were sticky about them.\nC. Why war was avoided: Lack of Soviet military options? JFK's\nhidden concessions?\nD. The effects of US nuclear superiority were starkly different\nin the early 1950s (the Soviets stood down in response) and\n\nthe early 1960s (the Soviets secretly moved missiles to Cuba,\nnearly provoked war).\n> Competing explanations:\n-- Khrushchev was more of a risk-taker than Stalin.\n-- Khrushchev had an aggressive option--moving missiles to\nCuba--that Stalin didn't have. What if Stalin had had\nsuch an option?\n> Implication: military superiority can be good or bad.\nX. CRISIS HISTORY WRITING: Perhaps the historical record\nunderstates the prevalence and effectiveness of conciliation as a\ntool of statecraft. Leaders tout their threats and conceal their\nconcessions, as JFK did. Hence history features successful acts of\nbelligerence while successful conciliations are downplayed.

      "content": "THEORIES OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS\nAND THEORIES OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY\nI. 14 GENERAL THEORIES OR FAMILIES OF THEORIES RELEVANT TO US\nFOREIGN POLICY\nA. Offense-defense theory. This theory has two variants:\n1. Threat variant: \"Security is the prime goal of states.\nWhen states are insecure they become more aggressive as\nthey try to gain more defensible borders, to acquire\nresources that enhance their power, to cut their\nneighbors down to size, and to install more friendly\nregimes in neighboring states. The search for security\ncauses wars, empires, interventions, and arms races.\"\nCorollary: \"War is more likely when conquest is easy,\nless likely when conquest is hard.\"\nTwo sub-variants: (a) \"States fear conquest and\naggress to avert it.\" (b) \"States fear violence against\ntheir citizens and aggress to avert it.\"\nPhenomena explained: why the US has been less\nimperialist than other powers, and has started fewer big\nwars than other powers (compare, e.g., to Germany).\nPrescription: the US can keep peace in Europe, East\nAsia (Korea), elsewhere by guaranteeing the safety of\nstates in these regions.\nHow could this theory be tested??\n2. Opportunity variant: The more easily states can conquer,\nthe more aggressive they become. \"States seize what\ntheir power allows; empires grow and contract as the\nmetropole's power rises and falls.\"\nA related idea: the \"security dilemma.\" \"The means states\nuse to increase their security decrease the security of\nothers.\"\nKey theorist: Robert Jervis.\nAssigned reading: Van Evera, \"Offense-Defense Theory\"\nB. Theories of Alliances.\n1. \"Balance of Threat\": \"States align against the most\nthreatening state (i.e., the most powerful, aggressive,\nnearby state) in the neighborhood.\" Vs. \"Bandwagoning\":\n\"States align with threatening states--intimidation wins\nfriends.\" Some argue that this theory explains why the\nU.S. had far more allies than the Soviet Union during the\nCold War (1947-89). The Soviets were more aggressive than\nthe U.S., and were closer to more states, so they were\nmore threatening to others, hence they scared others into\nAmerica's arms.\nPrescriptions: believers in bandwagoning will favor\nhawkish policies and bullying/belligerent tactics;\nbelievers in balancing will prefer dovish policies and\npolicies of reassurance.\nHow can these hypotheses be tested?\n\nKey theorists: Kenneth Waltz, Stephen Walt.\nAssigned reading: Walt, Origins of Alliances.\n2. \"Birds of a Feather Fly Together\" (vs. \"Birds of a\nFeather Fly Apart\"): \"Common ideology --> alliance\" vs.\n\"Common ideology --> conflict for leadership of the\nbrotherhood.\" Some argue that both U.S. and Soviet\nleaders put false faith in \"Birds of a feather fly\ntogether\" during the Cold War. The G.W. Bush\nadministration made the opposite error in 2003 regarding\nSaddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden, wrongly dismissing\nthe importance of their clashing ideologies.\nAssigned reading: Walt, Origins of Alliances.\nC. Nationalism. \"Nationalism makes imperialism very difficult;\nand nationalism is omnipresent and omnipotent; hence the age\nof empire is over.\" How to test this theory? Let's think\nof natural experiments.\nKey theorists: Carleton Hayes, Louis Snyder.\nAssigned reading: none.\nD. Collective goods: the \"tragedy of the commons\" and the \"free\nrider\" problem. \"Collective goods (a.k.a. positive\nexternalities) are under-provided; collective bads (a.k.a.\nnegative externalities) are over-provided.\" Implication: we\ntend to trash the environment. The tragedy of the commons\ngives us an incentive to pollute, and impedes cooperation to\nclean up pollution.\nKey theorists: Garret Hardin, Mancur Olson.\nAssigned reading: none.\nE. Marxist theories:\n1. Rosa Luxemburg: \"Capitalist states seek empires to serve\nas markets for excess production, & thus cure\ndepression.\" Explains U.S. entry into WWI?\n2. Harry Magdoff: \"Capitalist states intervene abroad to\nprotect their multinational corporations.\" Explains the\n1954 CIA-sponsored coup in Guatemala?\nAssigned readings: none.\nF. Peaceful democracies: \"Democracies seldom fight each other;\nhence a world of democracies would be peaceful.\"\nKey theorists: Immanuel Kant, Michael Doyle.\nAssigned reading: none.\nAnd a related idea ...\nG. Wimpy democracies: \"Selfish democratic publics won't pay to\nmaintain adequate armed forces; liberal societies have no\nstomach for war's injuries to individual rights.\"\nKey author: Jean Francois Revel.\nAssigned reading: none.\nH. Democracies led astray by election-year antics. \"During\npolitical campaigns U.S. politicians pander to U.S. voters\nby framing dangerous foreign policy positions that they\ncannot abandon once in office. The country is thereby led\ninto folly.\"\nAssigned reading: Michael Beschloss, \"Foreign Policy's Big\nMoment.\"\n\nAnother variant: \"Politicians out of power act to mess up\nincumbent presidents' foreign policies, as Nixon subverted\nJohnson's Vietnam peace effort in October 1968.\"\nI. Organization theory.\n1. \"Organizations seek size, wealth, autonomy, and\nconservation of their 'essence' (i.e., no change in their\nmission).\" Example: the Soviet military in the 1950s\npreserved its tank-army essence while leaving the USSR\nunprotected.\nKey theorist: Morton Halperin.\nAssigned reading: none.\n2. \"Organizations follow standard operating procedures.\"\nExample: Soviet missile installations in Cuba in 1962\nwere identical in shape to other Soviet installations,\nhence were easily detected by U.S. spy planes.\nKey theorist: Graham Allison.\nAssigned reading: none.\n3. \"Organizations cannot self-evaluate.\" An example: the\n\"intelligence to please\" syndrome--intelligence agencies\ndon't evaluate, they kiss up to power, some argue.\nKey theorist: Aaron Wildavsky.\nAssigned reading: Kristof, \"Save our Spooks.\"\nJ. Psychological theories.\n1. \"Attribution theory\"--states tend to attribute their own\nbehavior to their circumstances, while attributing\nothers' behavior to their innate character. (Hence\nstates see their own nasty conduct as excused by\nnecessity, while others' nasty conduct is unprovoked and\nunjustified.)\n2. A related syndrome: states tend to ascribe others' good\nbehavior to their own efforts to make the other behave\nwell; and to blame others' bad conduct on the other's\ninnate character.\nHence they underestimate their own\nrole in causing others' hostility; hence they exaggerate\nthe immutability of that hostility.\n3. Belief perseverance--states are slow to absorb new facts\nand realities that clash with their elite's existing\nbeliefs.\n4. States tend to exaggerate the shared character of\ninformation, hence they are often unaware when others'\nperceptions diverge from their own.\n5. States tend to exaggerate the centralized, disciplined,\nand coordinated character of others' behavior.\nKey theorist for hypotheses J1-J5: Robert Jervis.\nAssigned reading: none.\n6. \"Groupthink\"--internal dissent and policy evaluation are\nsuppressed to maintain small-group cohesion.\nKey theorist: Irving Janis. Assigned reading: none.\n7. Identity theory, ingroup-outgroup theory: \"Humans are\ngroupish. They readily sort themselves into competing\ngroups. Hence nationalism is powerful, and demagogues\nhave the advantage in public discourse.\"\n\nKey theorists: Sherif and Sherif.\nAssigned readings: none.\nK. \"Spiral Model\" vs. \"Deterrence.\"\n1. Spiral model: \"Wars arise when states punish others\nexpecting compliance; but punishment only provokes\nretaliation, sparking a conflict-spiral.\"\n2. Deterrence: \"Wars arise when states appease aggressors;\nthis leads the aggressor to expect further appeasement,\nand to ignore warnings when appeasement ends.\"\nKey theorist: Robert Jervis.\nAssigned readings: Jervis, Daniel Gilbert, and SVE\nhandout.\nL. Gender theories: \"Men are more aggressive than women;\nforeign policies made by men reflect male attributes.\"\nKey author: Joshua Goldstein\nAssigned reading: none.\nM. Credibility theory (\"deterrence theory\"--Thomas Schelling):\n\"The credibility of commitments is interconnected; the\nabandonment of one commitment destroys the credibility of\nothers.\"\nKey authors: Thomas Schelling, Daryl Press.\nAssigned reading: none.\nN. Domino theory: \"An aggressor's conquest of one state eases\nits conquest of nearby states.\"\nKey author: Jerome Slater. Assigned reading: none.\nII. THEORIES/THEORY FAMILIES SPECIFIC TO AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY\n(& DERIVED EXPLANATIONS)\nTheories specific to United States foreign policy:\nA. Elite Culture: the role of:\n1. Prep school/big business culture in foreign policy\nmaking--Princeton grads run US foreign policy --> USFP\nfavors US business, is cool toward democracy overseas\n(note clash with hypothesis II B6).\nAssigned readings: Isaacson and Thomas, Hersh.\n2. The national security establishment and the role of\nmilitary worldviews. Some argue that professional\nmilitaries are prone to exaggerate the hostility of other\nstates and the effectiveness of using force when they\ncommunicate to civilians. Some claim that the U.S.\nmilitary does this. Others counter that the U.S.\nmilitary has often been more dovish than U.S. civilian\nleaders since about 1980.\nAssigned reading: none.\n3. Elite ignorance of world affairs, 1900-1970. The USA as\ninnocent abroad.\nAssigned reading: Cohen, \"Great Caesar's Ghost.\"\nB. Public Opinion, Popular Culture, Ideology:\n1. Policy overselling --> policies develop lives of their\nown.\nKey theorist: Theodore Lowi. Assigned reading: none.\n2. Public ignorance --> policy blunders vs. Free marketplace\n\nof ideas --> public enlightenment --> wise policies.\nWhich is true? Is the public ignorant or enlightened?\nAssigned reading: Cohen.\n3. Academic irresponsibility, the cult of irrelevance\nprevalent in academe --> public is ignorant. American\nacademe as cause of public ignorance.\n4. The absent calamity: Unlike most nations, Americans have\nnever suffered epic death and destruction that stemmed\nfrom their own foreign policy blunders. This fosters\nblithe U.S. indifference toward studying world politics.\nBlunders result.\nAssigned reading: Cohen.\n5. A manipulated or incompetent press.\ni. U.S. government domination of the press --> tough\nquestions aren't asked, key facts omitted --> public\nis ignorant. Official dominion of press coverage as\ncause of public ignorance.\nAssigned readings: Just & Rosenstiel.\nii. Foreign dictators' can intimidate the press -->\ndictators decide how the press covers them.\nAssigned reading: Jordan, \"News We Kept To\nOurselves.\"\niii. The U.S press has deteriorated in recent years with\nthe rise of \"infotainment\" culture in mainstream\nmedia, propagandistic cable TV news, and talk radio.\nPlus the rise of the internet has eroded the revenue\nbase of the mainstream news media, so its\nnewsgathering has shrunk.

      "content": "AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY: INTRODUCTION\nI.\nCOURSE QUESTIONS REQUIREMENTS AND READINGS\nA. Questions addressed in 17.40 include:\n1. What explains past and present U.S. policies?\n2. Were the premises behind u.s. policies valid or false?\nWere their results good or bad?\nWere these results\ndesired or undesired by policy makers?\nWe will evaluate\nu.s. policies.\na. Were the policy's effects on the USA and U.S.\ninterests good or bad?\nConsider four U.S. interests:\n> National security interests: preserving U.S.\nsovereignty and avoiding war.\nDid past or present\nwars, interventions, doctrines and policies make the\nU.S. more or less secure in these terms?\n> Economic interests.\nDid U.S. policies advance\nthese?\n> Other interests: environment, public health, e.g.,\nprotecting against new pandemics.\nDo U.S. policies\nprotect these?\n> Philanthropic interests--promoting human rights or\notherwise \"doing the right thing\" by others.\nWhat\ncode of ethics should guide foreign policy?\nHave\nU.S. policies measured up to it?\nb. The policy's effects on other peoples and states.\n3. What should now be done?\nRegarding, e.g., al Qaeda,\nISIS/Iraq/Syria, the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction (WMD) , the North Korean and Iranian nuclear\nprograms, China's rise, national ballistic missile\ndefense, trade policy, climate change, Ukraine/Russia,\nAfghanistan/Pakistan.\n4. Predictions: what will be done?\nWe will focus on question #2, evaluation, especially of\nnational security policy.\nB. Class requirements and readings.\n> Discussion sections (\"recitation sections\") are required\nand important.\nPlease attend and please participate!\nWe\nneed your help to make sections work!\n> In sections you will present to the National Security\nCouncil and participate in debates.\n> Four papers: two -2-pagers and two -8-pagers.\nA draft of\nan -8 pager must be submitted in advance to your TA.\n> Two IS-minute quizzes.\n> One final.\n> Readings.\nC. Syllabus organization.\nWe progress in this order: (1)\nnational security overview; (2) general theories; (3) grand\nstrategies; (4) historical cases and policy problems\n(national security policy, foreign economic policy, and\nterror); (5) implications for current policy.\n\nD. Class missions, expectations.\n> Broad course missions: students will learn how to ask\nquestions, devise and frame explanations and arguments,\nand marshall and present evidence.\n> We focus on developing your communication skills.\nPast\nMIT alumni reported that they needed more communication\nand leadership skills to realize their goals in life.\nWe\nare here to help with that.\n> Absolutely no background knowledge of U.S. foreign\npolicy/diplomatic history is assumed for this course.\nFeel free to consult 17.40 staff about non-17.40 stuff like\nplanning your career.\nWe will offer what wisdom we can.\nII.\nWHAT IS POLITICAL SCIENCE?\nA. Experimentation vs. observation.\nBoth methods can work\nwell.\nB. Large-n (statistical) studies vs. case studies.\nBoth\nmethods work.\nThe nature of the data decides which method\nis stronger.\n> Natural experiments--situations in history that resemble\ncontrolled experiments--are especially strong tools of\ninvestigation.\nC. To test theories: (1) Infer predictions from the theory\nstating what we expect to observe in the world if the theory\nis valid, and what we should observe if it is false.\n(2)\nAssess the degree of congruence between our predictions and\nour observations.\nCongruent = theory is corroborated;\nincongruent = theory is infirmed.\nD. Accidents, chaos theory, and history:\n> Does politics have regularities--laws of motion--like\nthose of the natural world?\n> If accidents, personalities, and serendipity shape\nhistory, how can general theories explain the past?\nAnnie\nOakley could have killed Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm in\n-1889. If so, could she have saved us from the 20th\ncentury?\n(Maybe!)\nE. Why has political science achieved less than the natural\nsciences?\nF. Controversies in social science about how to do it.\n> Social scientists debate the best way to test theories.\nSome claim that large-n methods and/or controlled\nexperiments are inherently stronger than case methods.\nOthers argue that no method is inherently stronger;\n\nrather, the stronger method is the one that suits the data\navailable.\nThis varies by topic.\n> In U.S. history departments the study of international and\nmilitary history has been sidelined and replaced by social\nhistory (e.g., race, class and gender issues).\nThese are\nvery important but so is international history!\nIts\ndemise is harming our ability to study U.S. foreign\npolicy.\nIII. THE GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF POWER, l789-PRESENT. See the maps\nof the world scaled to GDP by Edwin Reischauer, in three\nversions (plain, Germania, and Sovietania); the 2005 map;\ntables 6, 17, 18, 30, 31, 35, and chart 2 from Paul Kennedy,\nRise and Fall of the Great Powers; and Table 4-1 from\nKenneth Oye, ed., Eagle in a New World.\nA. U.S. national security turns on (1) the global distribution\nof power, and (2) the intentions of other states and actors.\nCan others harm you?\nWill they try?\nB. Four questions about the nature of international power:\n1. Before 1945, what was national power made of?\nStrategists then argued that industrial power = military\npower = power.\nThey believed that other elements of\npower--population, military bases, control of critical\nraw materials like oil--also mattered but were secondary\nto industrial power.\nIndustrial power, measured in GDP,\nwas seen as the key index of power.\n2. What is national power made of today?\nIs industrial\npower still key?\nOr do weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\nchange everything?\nCan actors with little industrial\npower acquire WMD?\nIf they do, are they powerful despite\ntheir lack of industrial power?\n> North Korea, an impoverished state, has build nuclear\ndevices.\n> Some worry that stateless terrorists might buy or steal\nor be given weapons of mass destruction, or the\nmaterials to make them.\nDo these possibilities make obsolete the use of\nindustrial power as our key measure of national power?\n3. Offensive vs. defensive power: which dominates?\n> Was defense or offense easier among states before\nnuclear weapons arrived (1945)?\nBy how much?\nWhat\nimplications follow?\n> Have nuclear weapons changed the offense/defense\nequation? If so, how?\nSome argue that nuclear weapons\nmake conquest impossible among major powers.\nAre they\nright?\n4. Related: is destruction easier or harder than defense\nagainst destruction?\nC. The evolution of U.S. and global power, 1789-present.\n>\nU.S. industrial power grew vastly during 1789-1938.\nSee\ntables 6, 17, 18.\n> U.S. standing military power grew much less, 1789-1942,\ndue to America's mobilization strategy.\nSee tables 19,\n31, 35.\n\n> Industrial power was concentrated in the a few places:\nNorth America, Europe, and Japan.\nSee especially the\nworld maps drawn to GOP size and Oye table 4-1.\nD. Did American foreign and military policy make power\npolitical sense?\n1. Did Germany and its allies have any hope of defeating\nthe US and its allies in 1914 and 1939?\nIf not, should\nthe U.S. have been able to deter German expansion in\n1914 and 1939?\n> U.S. mobilization strategy: frugal prudence or\nstrategic blunder?\n2.\nDid U.S. efforts against Germany in 1917 and 1941 and\nthe Soviet Union in the Cold War avert real dangers?\nSpecifically, if these states had conquered all of\nindustrial Eurasia (that is, Western Europe, Russia and\nJapan) would they then have had enough power to conquer\nthe U.S.?\nSee maps and table 4-1.\n3.\nDid U.S. Cold War interventions in the Third World\n(Vietnam, Korea, Guatemala, Chile, Iran, Congo) make\nsense?\nSee maps and table 4-1.\nE. Will China's further rise threaten U.S. security? Will the\nspread of WMDs to non-state actors threaten U.S. security?\nIf so, how should the U.S. respond?\n>\nShould the US move to contain China and/or impede its\nrise?\nIs this necessary? Could it succeed?\n> Is a rising power always a danger to be stopped?\nBritain did not stop Prussia in 1870 and paid. Britain\ndid not stop the U.S. in 1861-65 and profited.\n>\nDoes the U.S. face other more serious threats (for\nexample WMD terror and climate change)? Should it\ncooperate with China (and Russia) to defeat these\nthreats?\n>\nCompare four threats: China, Russia, WMD terror, &\nclimate change.\nWhich is greatest?\nIV. THE EVOLUTION OF U.S. POLITICS & SOCIETY\nA. Ignorance: American knowledge of the world was low, then\nrose, now falls.\n> Americans now learn less about the world from the press\nthan 40 years ago.\nSchools teach less international\nhistory.\n> Unlike Europeans and Asians, Americans have never suffered\nthe full horrors of war in their homeland.\nAre they naive\nabout it?\nB. U.S. foreign policy was once run by aristocrats.\nThis is no\nlonger true.\nBut who now dominates?\nDC thinktanks &\nlobbies are increasingly important.\nWho controls them??\nC. The changing U.S. economy:\n> Fears of depression abated after 1941--until we forgot\nKeynes after 1980, creating a new risk of depressions.\n> Economic inequality diminished sharply in the U.S. during\n1941-1980, has expanded sharply since 1980.\nD. U.S. white racism & antisemitism greatly diminished after\n-1940.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n17.40 American Foreign Policy: Past, Present, Future\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "PREDICTING THE FUTURE AND PRESCRIBING FOR THE FUTURE:\nWHAT LOOMS AHEAD? WHAT POLICIES SHOULD THE U.S. ADOPT?\nI. COURSE THEORIES: DID THEY PASS/FLUNK TESTS? WHAT DID THEY\nEXPLAIN?\nWhich theories survived confrontation with the evidence, and\nwhich did not? How much history do they explain? What\nevaluative conclusions follow from our answers? (E.g., did\nthe U.S. overlook valid theories? Place faith in false ones?)\nA. Offense-defense (security dilemma) theory: US foreign\npolicy as a test and a case to explain.\n1. Threat variant: the greater the security threat states\nface, the more aggressive they become.\n2. Opportunity variant: the more easily states can\nconquer, the more aggressive they become.\nDoes U.S. activism correlate with America's sense of\ninsecurity? Of opportunity? Was American policy driven\nby a search for security or a desire to exploit\nopportunity? Were America's adversaries driven by\nsecurity concerns, or tempted by opportunity? Was the\nU.S. in fact insecure? Was it sufficiently aware of\nothers' security concerns and their likely reaction to a\nU.S. threat?\nB. Alliance theories:\n1. Balance of threat theory: can it explain the Cold\nWar's structure? What policy implications follow?\n2. Birds of a feather: did they fly together? How often\ndid the common U.S. expectation that birds of a\nfeather would fly together prove accurate?\nC. Spiral model vs. Deterrence: which model explains more?\n(Does either explain much?) Possible spirals: the US vs.\n3rd World; USSR vs. Western Europe. Possible deterrence\nfailures: US vs. Iraq 1991.\nD. Foreign Policy Elite theories: did elite\nvalues/personalities matter?\nE. Marxist theories: do they explain anything? U.S. entry\ninto WWI? Guatemala 1954?\nII. EVALUATING US FOREIGN POLICIES\nA. U.S. policies toward Europe, 1914-present.\n1. Effects on Europe: did U.S. policies help or harm\nEurope?\n2. Effects on the U.S.: was involvement in Europe a\nwasteful adventure or a wise investment?\nB. U.S. policies toward the Third World, 1898-present.\n1. Effects on Third World: was the U.S. an \"evil empire\"\nor white knight?\n2. Effects on the U.S.: was Third World involvement a\n\"bungle in the jungle\" or a smart stratagem?\nC. Overall quality of U.S. foreign policy making process: how\n\nclosely does it match the rational-legal scientific ideal?\nIs American foreign policy made by strategic wizards or by\nblundering bureaucrats and ignoramus voters?\nIII. PREDICTING THE FUTURE / PRESCRIBING FOR THE FUTURE\nA. How serious are geopolitical threats (that is, the threat\nof too much power in the hands of bad-acting states)?\nShould the U.S. act to avert them?\n1. The rise of China. Should the U.S. try to hamper\nChina's growth? Break China up? Help China grow, on\nthe theory that this will promote Chinese democracy?\nOn what theoretical or moral assumptions does the\nissue rest?\n2. The rise of other states: Russia? Should the U.S. try\nto stop their rise?\n3. The rise of nuclear proliferators. Should the U.S.\ntry to stop or even reverse WMD proliferation? If so,\nhow?\ni. What threat would a nuclear Iran or more-nuclear\nNorth Korea pose? What benefits would war to\ndisarm them provide?\na. Will N. Korea or Iran hand WMD to terrorists?\nb. Will N. Korea or Iran aggress against\nneighbors, believing that their nuclear\numbrellas protect them from countermeasures?\nii. What tactics are most likely to end the North\nKorean and Iranian nuclear programs?\na. Coercing them into dropping their nuclear\nprograms by economic sanctions?\nb. Preventing them from exporting their nuclear\nweapons by blockade?\nc. Somehow overthrowing their regimes by economic\npressure and/or covert action?\nd. Weaning them from their nuclear programs by\npositive inducements--trade agreements or\nsecurity guarantees?\ne. Or is war necessary? Or might even war be\nfutile? Counterproductive?\nRegarding Iran, the George W. Bush administration\nput all its chips on regime change. This didn't\nwork, as Iran's regime survived. The Obama\nadministration then used economic sanctions\nduring 2010-15 to coerce Iran to cut a deal, and\nIran to agree a deal in 2015. The Trump\nadministration now seems to be moving to abrogate\nthe deal. Good idea?\niii. Would an effort to remove Iranian or North Korean\nWMD by force succeed? Would it deter or dissuade\nproliferation by other WMD-seekers? Or might it\nfrighten these WMD seekers to seek WMD more\nactively?\nConsider both an airpower-only U.S. war on\n\nIran, and a U.S. ground invasion and occupation\nof Iran.\niv. At what cost could such wars be won? And could\nthe U.S. manage the occupations of N. Korea or\nIran?\nv. Is arms control an answer to nuclear\nproliferation? Is U.S. nuclear restraint or\ndisarmament an answer?\nvi. How should the U.S. address the longer-term\ndanger posed by emerging destructive technologies\n(biotechnology, nanotechnology) as described by\nMartin Rees, Our Final Hour. We need answers to\nthis question, as these technologies (e.g.,\nCRISPR) are upon us!!\nB. How large is the WMD terror threat? How should it be\naddressed?\nSpecific related dangers:\n-- Al-Qaeda and ISIS, how to address them?\n-- \"Loose nukes\": Russian loose nukes; poorly secured\nnuclear material at research reactors. Al-Qaeda or\nother terrorists may get their WMD from Russia or\nresearch reactors. Let's finish securing this stuff!\n-- Unstable Pakistan: Al-Qaeda uses Pakistan as a haven,\nand the Afghan Taliban uses Pakistan as a base for its\nrampaging in Afghanistan. Some in the Pakistan\nmilitary are religious extremists. And Pakistan has\n~80-100 nuclear weapons. So terrorists might gain WMD\nthere too. So let's stabilize it! But how??? Serious\nthought is needed. Some analysts think Pakistan is the\nmost dangerous place in the world. But the U.S. has no\nplan to address it.\nC. Peacemaking.\n1. The Israel-Palestinian conflict. Could the U.S.\nimpose peace on Israel and the Palestinians?\nMany experts argue that the continuation of this\nconflict harms American standing in the Islamic world\nand strengthens al-Qaeda. Some say the US could\nproduce peace if it twisted arms.\n2. The India-Pakistan conflict. This conflict is\nfuelling Islamic terrorism, radicalism in Pakistan,\nand Pakistani support for the Taliban insurgency in\nAfghanistan. Is it time for the U.S. to push for a\npeace settlement? Could the U.S. achieve one?\n3. Consider a larger move to resolve things in South\nAsia--a pair of grand bargains:\na. Push for India-Pakistan peace.\nb. Organize the neutralization of Afghanistan.\n4. Consider moves to resolve civil wars in Iraq, Syria,\nYemen, Libya, Ukraine; also South Sudan, Central\nAfrican Republic, Congo. And to avert war in Burundi.\nD. Saving the global commons, especially the environment.\n\n1 The Great Law of the Iroquois Confederacy required that:\n\"In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our\ndecisions on the next seven generations.\"\n\nUnchecked climate change could do great economic damage\nand displace scores or hundreds of millions of people.\nCan we solve this problem? See assigned articles by\nFrank, Homer-Dixon, and Davenport.\nClimate change can probably be halted by phasing in a\nsteep global carbon tax. Such a tax would spark the\ncreation of potent new clean energy technologies that are\nunimagined today. These green technologies would replace\ncarbon-based energy by underbidding it in the market.\nThis solution would cost rather little--far less than 1\npercent of gross world product per year. See assigned\narticle by Joe Romm. Ominously, however, six imposing\nproblems make it unlikely that we will halt climate\nchange.\n(1) The individual pursuit of self-interest makes the\nproblem worse, not better. The environment is a \"commons\"\nor \"collective good,\" so individuals are rewarded by\ntaking actions that harm it--although the group as a whole\nis injured. Market forces therefore cannot solve this\nproblem.\n(2) Global warming pits a concentrated special\ninterest--the oil and coal industries--against the general\nglobal public interest, which is harmed by warming.\nSpecial interests almost always defeat the general\ninterest because they are better organized. So Exxon\nMobil, which opposes action against climate change, has\nmore influence than the broad public.\n(3) Solutions to global warming require international\ncooperation. The world's major states must jointly agree\nto implement a carbon tax. But governments are bad at\ncooperation, and bad at solving problems that require\ncooperation with others.\n(4) Delayed damage--the harm done by emitting\ngreenhouse gasses is delayed, and so is largely hidden\nwhile the damage is being done. The human race may\nunleash irreversible climatic calamity before the first\nsigns of that calamity become clear.\nSolutions to this conundrum requires that the American\npublic know enough science to appreciate the potential\ndangers of dynamics that science has identified (like\nclimate change) but are not yet manifest. But the U.S.\npublic knows little science and does not listen to\nscientists. See assigned article by Cornelia Dean.\n(5) Western moral and religious traditions (unlike\nothers, e.g. the Iroquois1) give short shrift to the\nrights of future generations. Instead our ethics assume\n\nthat each generation must solve its own problems. Hence\nwe see little duty to sacrifice to preserve the world for\nfuture generations. Watch out grandchildren! We live for\nourselves, not for you!\n(6) The threat posed by climate change has an anodyne\nappearance that does not resonate with human threat\nresponses. No blood or sharp teeth.\nBottom line: global warming has a clear solution but\nthe human race is probably incapable of implementing that\nsolution. Oh dear!\nE. Human rights: what about doing the right thing? \"Those\nwho really deserve praise are the people who, while human\nenough to enjoy power, nevertheless pay more attention to\njustice than they are compelled to do by their situation.\"\n(Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, trans. Rex\nWarner [Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1972], p. 80.)\nIV. WHAT GRAND STRATEGY SHOULD THE U.S. ADOPT?\nConsider again the broad options we discussed in September:\nIsolation\nNeo-containment Type #1: the U.S. contains China's rise.\nNeo-containment Type #2: the U.S. limits the access of\nsome states (North Korea, Iran) to WMD.\nNeo-rollback: the USA wages preventive war against rogue\nstates that pursue WMD.\nPromoting peace:\n> Selective pacification, or \"selective engagement\": the\nU.S. prevents interstate conflict/war in industrial\nregions.\n> Global pacification/New World Order: the U.S. prevents\ninterstate conflict/war everywhere.\nU.S. global empire: the U.S. seeks to shape other states'\ndomestic political and economic order.\nConcert: the U.S. seeks to cooperate with other major\npowers, including China, to avert WMD terror and to stem\nclimate change.\nYou be the judge.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n17.40 American Foreign Policy: Past, Present, Future\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "THE \"SPIRAL MODEL\" vs. THE \"DETERRENCE MODEL'\"\nWhen are threats of punishment (\"sticks\") the best way to\ngain other states' compliance, and when do positive inducements\n(promise of rewards, appeasement, or \"carrots\") work best?\nBoth\npolicies sometimes succeed, but both can also make things worse.\nSticks can provoke a hostile response, while carrots can lead the\ntarget to sense weakness, make more demands, and dismiss final\nwarnings not to move further.\nSometimes either sticks or carrots will work, and sometimes\nneither works.\nHowever, it often happens that one will work\nwhile the other will make things worse. 2\nIn these situations the\nchoice between carrots and sticks is crucial, since that choice\ndetermines if policy will succeed or prove counter-productive.\nI.\nTHE SPIRAL MODEL AND DETERRENCE MODEL DEFINED\nThe spiral model and deterrence model are similar in kind and\nopposite in substance.\nBoth models try to explain the\noutbreak of war.\nBoth assign a central role to national\nmisperception: specifically, both posit that states adopt war-\ncausing policies in the false expectation that these policies\nwill elicit compliance.\nHowever, they posit opposite\nmisperceptions.\n,\nThese models are outlined in Robert Jervis, Perception\nand Misperception in International Politics (Princeton: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 1976), chapter 3 (\"Deterrence, the Spiral\nModel, and Intentions of the Adversary,\"), pp. 58-113.\nJervis\nspoke only of \"deterrence,\" not of a \"deterrence model,\" but the\nset of concepts he defines as \"deterrence\" comprise a model, so I\nrefer here to a \"deterrence model.\"\nThus four situations are possible; (1) either carrots or\nsticks will work (i.e. either strategy will elicit better\nbehavior from the other side); (2) neither carrots nor sticks\nwill work (i.e. both strategies will elicit worse behavior); (3)\ncarrots will work, while sticks will make things worse; and (4)\nsticks will work, while carrots will make things worse.\n\nA.\nThe Spiral Model posits that conflicts arise from\npunishment applied in the false expectation that it will\nelicit better behavior from the other side, when in fact\nit elicits worse behavior.\nAngered or frightened by the\npunishment, the other becomes more aggressive--adopting\nwider aims, and/or becoming more willing to use force to\ndefend them.\nThe first side responds with more\npunishment, assuming that its first punishment was too\nmild, the other grows still more belligerent, etc.\nIn\nthis way two sides divided by only minor differences can\nspiral into intense confrontation or war.\nPrescription:\nAppeasement works better than threat of\npunishment.\nCarrots are safer than sticks.\nPeace is best\npreserved by conciliation.\nB.\nThe Deterrence Model posits that conflicts arise from acts\nof appeasement made in the false expectation that\nappeasement will elicit better behavior from the other\nside, when in fact it elicits worse behavior.\nThe other,\nbelieving that it coerced or frightened the appeaser to\noffer its concessions, assumes that more threats will\nelicit more concessions.\nHence it makes additional\ndemands, backed by threats.\nIt also may dismiss the\nappeaser's threats after the appeaser changes course and\nadopts deterrence; as a result it may move too far and\ntrigger war.\nPrescription:\nThreat of punishment works better than\nappeasement.\nSticks are safer than carrots.\nPeace is\nbest preserved by unyielding policies.\nNote: the spiral model incorporates one misperception--the\npunishing state falsely expects that punishment will elicit\nbetter behavior from the other, when it elicits worse\nbehavior.\nThe deterrence model incorporates two\nmisperceptions--the appeasing state falsely expects that\nappeasement will elicit better behavior, when in fact it\nelicits worse behavior; and the appeased state then falsely\nexpects the appeaser won't carry out its later threats when in\nfact it will.\nII.\nCAUSES OF SPIRALS\nThree explanations for spirals have been offered:\nA.\nA psychological explanation: policymakers suffer the\n\nsyndromes that cognitive psychology suggests individuals\nsuffer, hence the states they govern exhibit these same\nsyndromes.\nSpecifically, states underestimate their own\nrole in causing others' hostility, because (1) they\nunderestimate the aggressiveness of their own conduct\nbecause they engage in wishful thinking about themselves;\n(2) they also believe (following attribution theory) that\ntheir own aggressiveness was compelled by circumstances--\nspecifically, by the other side's behavior; and (3) they\nfurther assume that the other side knows this.\nAs a\nresult they see the other's provoked hostility as\nunprovoked malice; the other side is in the wrong, knows\nit, is just testing to see if its bluff will be called,\nand will back down if its bluff is called.\nB.\nA nationalism explanation: states and societies paint\nrose-colored self-images in their schoolbooks and public\ndiscourse, largely to build patriotism and a spirit of\ncivic self-sacrifice in the population.\nAs a result they\nare unaware that they injured other societies in the past;\nhence they are unaware that others might have legitimate\ngrievances against them, or might have legitimate fears of\ntheir future conduct based on their past behavior.\nHence\nthey view others complaints against them as unprovoked\nmalice; the other side is in the wrong, knows it, is just\ntesting to see if its bluff will be called, and will back\ndown if its bluff is called.\nC.\nA bandwagon belief explanation: states wrongly believe\nthat other states tend to bandwagon rather than balance in\nresponse to threats.\nHence they threaten others in the\nfalse expectation that the other will respond by\nconceding, when in fact their threats provoke a backlash.\nIII.\nWHEN DOES EACH MODEL APPLY?\nWhen do carrots work better, and when do sticks work better?\nThese conditions can be important:\nA.\nIs the other state an aggressor or a status quo power?\nIn\nother words, does the other have large aims beyond those\nit now declares?\nIf the other is an aggressor, it will\nusually know this, will assume you know it, and will infer\nweakness from any concessions.\nBut note: some aggressors don't know they are aggressors--\n\nneurotic Wilhelmine states, who forget each past act of\naggression as soon as they are done committing it.\nWith\nthese states appeasement may be safer.\nSo there are two issues:\n1. Is the other an aggressor or not?\n2. Does the other see itself as an aggressor or not?\nIt is safest to apply sticks when the other is an\naggressor and knows it; then it is really just probing\nto find out if you have divined its nefarious aims.\nB.\nAre the other state's claims legitimate or illegitimate?\nThe other will infer a wider weakness on your part if you\nconcede to illegitimate than to legitimate claims, because\nconcessions to illegitimate claims set a wider precedent.\nNote: some states making illegitimate claims don't think\ntheir claims are illegitimate.\nWith these states\nappeasement may be safer, and standing firm more\ndangerous.\nSo there are two issues:\n1. Are the other's demands legitimate or not?\n2.\nDoes the other see its demands as legitimate or not?\nC.\nHow strong is the other state? It is more dangerous to\nappease strong states, because they are more likely to\ninfer that you conceded to their threats, not to the\nlegitimacy of their claims.\nWeak states are less likely\nto make such an inference.\nD.\nAre the resources demanded cumulative, that is, additive?\nIf so, you may be giving away assets that will change the\nother side's perspective--al10wing it to redefine its\naims, since it now could take what it could not take\nformerly.\nIts appetite will grow with the eating because\nits ability to eat will grow with the eating.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n17.40 American Foreign Policy: Past, Present, Future\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "U.S. FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY:\nTRADE, INVESTMENT, AND AID ISSUES AND POLICIES\nI. TRADE THEORY AND BACKGROUND\nA. Classical Liberalism argues: more freedom of all kinds is\nbetter. People and states have large common interests.\nThese are best realized by fostering political, economic,\nand religious freedom. We should replace absolute monarchy\nwith democracy; religious absolutism with freedom of\nreligion; and economic controls with free markets and free\ntrade.\nB. Free Trade versus Mercantilism:\n1. Free trade (\"liberal\") doctrine holds that a state's\nprosperity is maximized by the unfettered exchange of\ngoods and services with other states. This is achieved\nby minimizing restrictions on trade.\n2. Mercantile doctrine holds that a state's prosperity is\nmaximized by achieving a trade surplus--by exporting\nmore than it imports. This is achieved by state\nsubsidies to exporting industries, and by state\nrestrictions on imports, such as tariffs, import quotas,\nand import-impeding regulation of imported products.\nMotives: to accumulate specie (1700s); and/or to end\nrecessions/limit unemployment (recent times).\nC. The logic of free trade rests on David Ricardo's theory of\ncomparative advantage (1817): \"Utopia is far more efficient\nthan Flatland at making cheese, and moderately more\nefficient at making wine. Utopia and Flatland both prosper\nby trading Utopia's cheese for Flatland's wine, even though\nUtopia now imports wine from a country that makes it less\nefficiently that Utopia, because trade lets Utopians\nspecialize in what they do best.\" A social science theory\nof great importance!\nD. A short history of trade: Restrictions on trade have fallen\nsince the late 1700s, and especially since 1945, as\n\"liberal\" ideas won the day. The US led the movement to\nfree trade during 1945-today.\nBut the U.S. still restricts imports of some products,\nespecially those produced by fading U.S. \"sunset\"\nindustries--agriculture and textiles/apparel. Agriculture\nand textiles are the \"sunrise\" industries for the world's\npoorest countries so these U.S. restrictions are a harsh\nblow to the world's poor.\nE. 2-way vs. 1-way trade. Ricardo noted the benefits of 2-way\ntrade. Many in the U.S. today implicitly prefer 1-way\n(export-only) trade, which is a form of mercantilism.\nF. Is a US trade deficit good or bad? Neo-mercantilists\nbelieve it bad. Others argue that it represents a net\ntransfer of wealth to America, hence is good. Americans\n\nwind up with neat stuff--cars and electronics from Japan\nand China--while Japan and China get only paper promises\n(your money). We get the benefits of trade without doing\nany work! What's wrong with that?\nII. NINE PROTECTIONIST ARGUMENTS\nA. \"Save US jobs\": \"We must exclude imports to save jobs and\nindustries threatened by foreign competition!\" This\nargument is advanced by industries too inefficient to\ncompete on equal terms against foreign imports. But others\nargue:\n-- We can save jobs and industries by using monetary policy\n(having the Federal Reserve Bank lower interest rates)\nor fiscal policy (moving to deficit spending) to\nregulate the business cycle and pep up the economy when\nit slows. This is how the US has prevented another\ndepression since 1941 and moderated the Great Recession\nof 2007-present.\n-- We can subsidize the retraining of workers in industries\nthat can't beat the foreign competition, instead of\nindirectly subsidizing the industries themselves through\ntrade restrictions.\n-- Other countries may retaliate by restricting their US\nimports, causing a spiral of protectionism that closes\ndown world trade and leaves all worse off. The collapse\nof world trade after Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley\ntariff (1930) illustrates.\nWhen the U.S. has low unemployment we rarely hear the jobs\nargument. When unemployment is high we hear it more\nloudly.\nB. Infant industry arguments (Adam Smith, Alexander Hamilton,\nFriedrich List): \"Infant industries merit protection while\nthey develop the economies of scale and expertise they need\nto face international competition.\" Many economists accept\nthis argument. But will the infant ever grow up and get\noff the dole? Some fear not.\nC. Strategic trade argument--an expansion of the \"infant\nindustry\" argument. It holds: in industries in which firms\n(1) achieve large economies of scale, and (2) \"learn by\ndoing\"--get more efficient as they gain experience--the top\ndog in the industry can dominate the world, destroy\ncompetitors, and earn monopoly profits.\n--\nImplication: states should protect and subsidize such\nindustries.\n-- Problem: there are few such industries. Aircraft\nmanufacture may be an example, but there aren't many\nothers, if any. This reflects the power of global-\nscale market forces. Global markets are especially\npowerful since they are so vast. They are usually too\nstrong to override by state policies. Let others\n(Japan) try--they'll be sorry. Their strategic trade\nrestrictions damage us in small ways but damage them in\n\nlarger ways. So let's not follow them on their path of\nfolly.\n--\nAnother problem: governments are inept at identifying\nsuch industries even if they do exist.\nD. Externalities arguments: \"We should subsidize and protect\nindustries (e.g., high-technology industries) that produce\nspinoffs (e.g., high technologies) that benefit the rest of\nthe economy.\" But can governments correctly identify these\nindustries?\nE. Coercing other governments to change policies.\n1. Some advocate protection to coerce others to open their\nmarkets. \"We should restrict others' imports until they\nease their restrictions on US imports.\"\n> But will retaliation start a trade war, leaving all\nworse off? In other words, can we tell whether\nretaliation will cause \"deterrence\" or a \"spiral\"?\n2. Some advocate protection to coerce others into other\ntrade-related policy changes, e.g., to adopt U.S. labor\nstandards, or environmental protection standards. But\ncritics say: \"These demands are just excuses to protect\nrelatively inefficient U.S. industries from\ninternational competition.\"\n3. Many advocate trade sanctions--limits on imports and\nexports--to coerce others to align non-trade-related\npolicies (e.g., security policies or human rights\npolicies) with U.S. wishes.\na. Unilateral economic sanctions never work, but\nsanctions can be an effective tool of persuasion when\npursued multilaterally. Threat of multilateral\nsanctions succeed as often as threat of force. See\ne.g., US-led sanctions against Iran, 2013-15.\nb. \"Smart\" sanctions--actions aimed at the assets and\nlifestyle of governing elites, such as freezing their\nforeign accounts--are often wiser than trade\nsanctions, because trade sanctions injure whole\npopulations while smart sanctions target only the\ndecision makers. But the banking community dislikes\nsmart sanctions, so often trade sanctions are\nunwisely pursued instead.\nF. National security: \"Free trade injures national security.\"\n1. \"If our adversary gains more from trade than we do we\nshouldn't trade with them, because they may convert\ntheir gains into weapons and subjugate us.\" This is the\nmain reason why military adversaries seldom trade with\neach other, and a key argument against US trade with\nChina.\n2. \"We must maintain critical war industries that feed our\nmilitary machine, hence we must protect them from\nforeign competition if they could not survive the\ncompetition of world markets in peacetime.\" 60 years\nago some argued for protecting the U.S. steel industry\non these grounds.\n\nG. Economic stratification--\"Free trade helps the rich but\npunishes the poor.\"\n1. Impoverishment of unskilled workers in the advanced\ncountries (i.e., the U.S.): \"Free trade puts U.S.\nunskilled workers in direct competition with vast pools\nof unskilled workers in the Third World; this drives\ndown wages for US unskilled workers; this widens the\nincome gaps between U.S. classes.\" The Stolper-\nSamuelson theorem frames this argument. In theory we\nmight deal with this problem by subsidizing the wages of\nlow-wage workers, or by otherwise compensating low-wage\nworkers. But in practice this doesn't happen in the\nU.S. See assigned reading by Dani Rodrik.\n2. Worldwide \"races to the bottom\" in social policy: \"When\ngoods and services move freely, companies can more\neasily move to the country that gives it the best\nterms--i.e., low taxes, narrow labor rights, the right\nto pollute--and then export their products to their main\nmarkets. Companies can use this threat to move as a\nlever to compel governments everywhere to restrict labor\nrights and transfer tax burdens from businesses to\nothers.\" A global \"race to the bottom\" results that\nwidens the gulf between rich and poor in all societies.\nH. Protecting other cultures--\"Under free trade the U.S.\nexports its noxious culture products to the world, enraging\nor corrupting other societies\":\n1. Other countries (Canada, France, Islamic states) object\nto U.S. insistence that they cannot restrict imports of\nU.S.-made TV, film and other entertainment. Their\nargument: \"We want our culture, not yours. Your media\nproducts preach violence, hedonism, and greed. Many are\npornographic. Such rotten values caused Rome to fall.\nPlease keep MTV and such to yourselves. We don't want\nto swim in that sewer.\" Others answer: \"If you don't\nwant these products, don't buy them.\" And the answer\ncomes back: \"Market forces often cause bad results for\nsociety. You Americans won't allow free import of\ncocaine, despite the market for them. Why should we\nallow free import of poisons from Hollywood?\"\n2. Some argue that jamming MTV down the throat of\ntraditional cultures fuels angry religious\nfundamentalism around the world. \"The U.S. should stop\nexporting its noxious entertainment products for its own\ngood.\"\nI. Rapid economic churning--the rise and fall of industries-\nis harmful. It creates personal insecurity and disrupts\nvaluable social institutions--communities (see Edmund Burke\non their value), neighborhoods, and extended families.\nOutsourcing jobs destroys social fabric. Free trade should\nbe limited when it fosters harmfully rapid \"creative\ndestruction\" in the US.\n\nIII. NON-ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS FOR FREE TRADE\nA. \"Free trade causes economic interdependence, which causes\npeace, so let's promote free trade.\"\nB. \"Free trade causes prosperity, which causes democracy,\nwhich causes many good things including peace, so let's\npromote free trade.\"\nIV. BOLSTERING FREE TRADE: METHODS\nA. Reciprocity. Restrict imports from countries that restrict\nU.S. imports.\nB. Make regional free trade agreements, e.g., the 1993 North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, or \"NAFTA\", which\nestablished free trade between Canada, the US, and Mexico.\nC. Make global free trade agreements, e.g., the General\nAgreement on Tariff and Trade, or \"GATT\", established in\n1947, institutionalized and renamed the World Trade\nOrganization, or \"WTO\", in 1995.\nD. Spread some enlightenment! Educate publics on how much\nthey are losing by protecting their economy!\nV. INVESTMENT ISSUES\nA. Raising US national rates of savings and investment will\nspur U.S. economic growth. And if so...\nB. Should the US government protect multinational corporations\nin their conflicts with Third World nationalist\ngovernments? Won't this encourage capital outflow in the\nform of foreign investment? For example, have efforts to\npunish Cuban abuses of U.S. corporations in Cuba (e.g., the\n1990s-era Helms-Burton law) serve U.S. interests?\nC. Should the US fear foreign investment here? Is it scary or\ngood that foreigners own much of America?\nVI. FOREIGN AID ISSUES\nA. US foreign aid is small--only $23 billion (one twenty-third\nthe size of the US defense budget, ~1 percent of total US\nfederal budget). This is chump change.\nB. What can aid achieve?\n1. Can rich states pull poor states from poverty by giving\naid? The evidence is mixed. The counter-argument: \"aid\ndistorts market forces.\"\n2. Is aid an effective foreign policy tool? Yes. Bribery\nby-\"foreign aid\" often works! Aid as baksheesh.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n17.40 American Foreign Policy: Past, Present, Future\nFall 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "UNITED STATES INTERESTS AND GRAND STRATEGIES\nI. GRAND STRATEGIES MATTER. Some failed grand strategists:\nNapoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, Hitler, Neville Chamberlain. Ouch!\nBad strategies bring bad outcomes! And Woodrow Wilson lacked a\npost-war strategy for taming Germany. Result: WWII. Ouch!\nII. NATIONAL SECURITY GRAND STRATEGIES, COLD WAR ERA (1947-1989)\nA. The \"Whether to Contain\" Debate: Isolation vs. Containment\nvs. Rollback (1947-1964). The debate turned on four\nquestions:\n1. How cumulative are industrial resources? Can a\nconqueror convert these resources into military power,\nthen use them to take more?\nIsolationists: \"resources are not cumulative--empires\nbleed their owners.\"\nRollbackers: \"resources are very cumulative--empires\nstrengthen their owners.\"\n2. How easy is conquest? Can the USA conquer the USSR?\nVice versa?\nIsolationists: \"conquest is very hard\"; Rollbackers:\n\"conquest is easy.\"\n3. How aggressive is the USSR? (Is war with the USSR\ninevitable?)\nIsolationists: \"The Soviets are moderately aggressive,\nwar is avoidable.\"\nTotal Rollbackers: \"The Soviets are very aggressive,\nwar is inevitable.\"\n4. Will offensive action against the USSR provoke it or\ncalm it down?\nContainers: \"offensive policies will provoke Soviet\nretaliation and war.\"\nPartial Rollbackers: \"offensive policies will scare\nthe Soviets into a stand-down.\"\nKey reading, Gaddis, Strategies of Containment.\nKey debaters: Robert Taft for Isolation, George Kennan and\nWalter Lippmann for Containment, James Burnham and General\nNathan Twining for Rollback.\nB. The \"How to Contain\" Debate: Finite Containment vs. Global\nIntervention (for example, in Vietnam, Guatemala, Chile,\nNicaragua, El Salvador, Angola, etc.) (1965-1991). Four\nkey questions underlay this debate:\n1. Size of Soviet threat to Third World: can the Soviets\nseize it?\na. By direct military intervention?\nb. By victory of local Marxist proxies? (Do birds of\nreddish feathers fly together?)\n2. How \"cumulative\" are Third World resources? Would a\nSoviet empire in the 3rd World tilt the global balance\nof power toward the USSR?\n\na. Value of 3rd world military bases?\nb. Does US economy depend on 3rd world raw materials?\nc. Domino theory--is it true?\nd. Credibility theory--are commitments interdependent?\ne. Does the nuclear revolution make conventional-era\ncumulativity arguments obsolete, by making conquest\nso hard that no Third World gains could position the\nUSSR to conquer the USA?\n> An axiom relevant to debates #1 and #2: \"A wise warrior\nshoots with a rifle, not with a shotgun.\"\n3. Can US interventions against the 3rd world left succeed?\n4. Would independent communist states threaten US security?\nKey debaters: George Kennan, Walter Lippmann, & Hans\nMorgenthau for Finite Containment; NSC-68 (Dean Acheson)\nand Walter Rostow for Global Intervention.\nIII. NATIONAL SECURITY GRAND STRATEGIES, POST-COLD WAR ERA\n(1991-9/11/2001)\nSeven U.S. grand security strategies were proposed during\n1991-2001:\n1. Isolation: the USA comes home. The Soviet collapse in 1991\nremoved the only real threat to the U.S. Time to come home\nand celebrate!\n2. Neo-containment/ Type #1: the USA contains the new\npotential Eurasian hegemon (usually identified as China).\nThe USA would contain the potential hegemon's imperial\nexpansion, and might also try to hamper its economic\ngrowth.\n> Tactical debates about executing strategy 2 (and 3 and\n4):\na. Unilateral vs. multilateral strategy. The George W.\nBush (\"Bush 43\") administration (2001-2009) leaned\nunilateral, the Barack Obama administration (2009-17 was\nmore multilateral, the Donald Trump administration is\nmore unilateral.\n> A relevant strategist: Tom Sawyer. Sawyer's axiom:\nit is better to persuade other boys to whitewash the\nfence than to whitewash it oneself.\nb. Threats vs. inducements to win allies. Bush 43 relied\nmainly on the big stick to win friends; Obama used both\nsticks and inducements; Trump threatens sticks.\n3. Neo-containment Type #2: the USA contains the world's most\ncrazy or hostile states (North Korea, Iran) by limiting\ntheir control of special technologies (weapons of mass\ndestruction, or \"WMD\") or oil resources, using active\ndeterrence and coercion and by lowering US dependence on\ntheir products (oil).\n4. Neo-rollback: the USA wages preventive war against rogue\nstates that pursue WMD such as Iraq 2003 (and perhaps North\nKorea or Iran today) and against otherwise unfriendly\nregimes (Taliban in Afghanistan 2001, Qadafy in Libya 2011,\n\nChavez in Venezuela, Aristide in Haiti). For example,\nneoconservatives in the 1990s and the Bush 43\nadministration favored \"regime change\" of rogue regimes and\nother unfriendly regimes. Framing this strategy are\nSanger, \"Bush to Formalize,\" and Lieber and Lieber, \"Bush\nNational Security Strategy\" (assigned).\n5. Selective pacification, or \"selective engagement\": the USA\nprevents interstate conflict/war in industrial regions\n(Europe, E. Asia, Persian Gulf). \"War elsewhere hurts the\nUSA, so let's prevent it.\"\n6. Global pacification/New World Order: the USA prevents\ninterstate conflict/war everywhere. The US could do this:\na. Unilaterally: the US acts as a global policeman; or\nb. Multilaterally: the US acts with allies or in a\ncollective security system.\n7. U.S. global social engineering/global empire: the USA\nundertakes to prevent civil war, and/or protect human\nrights, and/or spread democracy, and/or spread market\neconomics around the world (or in part of the world, such\nas the Middle East).\nThe rationale is mainly idealist/philanthropic, but can\ninclude security: \"civil wars tend to spread to entangle\nthe US so lets stop them\"; \"democracies seldom fight other\ndemocracies, hence the US enjoys more peace in a democratic\nworld, so lets impose democracy\"; and \"democracies produce\nfewer terrorists, so the US is more secure in a democratic\nworld, so let's impose democracy.\"\nExamples: Bill Clinton's policy of \"engagement and\nenlargement\" of the zone of democracy, 1993-2001; Bush 43's\npro-democracy 2nd inaugural address, 2005; the imperial\npolicy favored by some conservatives since 2001 (see\nassigned news articles on \"American Imperialism, Embraced,\"\nThe New York Times Magazine, December 9, 2001; and Thomas\nE. Ricks, \"Empire or Not? A Quiet Debate over U.S. Role,\"\nWashington Post, August 21, 2001); US intervention in\nSomalia 1992-3; US/French/British overthrow of the Qadafy\nregime in Libya, 2011; and recent calls for the US to\noverthrow the Assad regime in Syria.\nCan the U.S. pull this off? Will the U.S. benefit by\ndoing it? Specifically: can democracy be exported by force\nto other societies? Does the US know how to do it? Is\ndemocracy good for everyone? Are market economics good for\neveryone? Is regime change always a good remedy for human\nrights abuse? For civil war?\nWhere is counter-terror in this scheme? It's not prominent.\nIV. SECONDARY INTERESTS AND STRATEGIES TO PROTECT THEM, ALL\nERAS. BUT ARE THESE INTERESTS REALLY SECONDARY?\nA. Human rights: should the U.S. act to protect them? E.g.,\nshould it have moved to stop genocide in Rwanda in 1994?\nIn South Sudan and Darfur, 1982-2008? Brutality in Libya,\n\n2011? Mass murder in Syria in 2011-present? The killing\nof a million in Zimbabwe since 1990? The killing of\nmillions in Congo, 1996-present? The ongoing expulsion of\nthe Rohingya from Burma? See Kaufmann, Cooper, Kristof\nand Kinzer in your assigned readings.\nB. Environmental interests: preventing climate change and\nother environmental damage. Many fear that human-caused\nwarming will reach catastrophic levels in a few years if\nunchecked. If so, oceans rise will destroy large coastal\nregions, including many great cities. Verdant regions\nwill become deserts. Scores or hundreds of millions will\nbe made homeless. Great economic damage will ensue.\nConflicts may erupt as desperate groups fight for a place\nin this dark new world. (Oh dear! This interest doesn't\nsound secondary!)\nThe climate change problem has feasible solutions--a\ncarbon tax would likely work well--but here are some\nreasons why we may be unable to solve it:\n1. It pits a concentrated interests (carbon fuel\nindustries) against a more dispersed general interest\n(everyone else). Concentrated interests usually win\nsuch fights.\n2. Solutions require international cooperation among\nstates. Instead states will free-ride, letting others\nsolve the problem while they shirk.\n> Problems #1 and #2 are manifestations of Mancur\nOlson's collective goods theory in action.\n3. The climate science community is neither adept at using\nnor fond of using public relations techniques to make\nits findings known to publics. But such techniques are\nnecessary to reach global publics.\n4. Western ethical and religious traditions do not\nemphasize moral obligations to future generations\n(unlike, for example, the Iroquois Great Law, which\nrequires that we consider the effects of our actions\ndown to the seventh generation.)\n5. The climate change danger has no analogies in human\nhistory. Humans often think analogically; so, seeing\nno analogies to the danger, people dismiss it. (But\noffering useful analogies is Jared Diamond, Collapse, a\nvaluable book).\n6. The climate change danger does not have a primordial\nsignature such as screaming, big teeth, spattering\nblood, or fire. Humans over-respond to dangers with\nsuch primordial signatures, but under-respond to slow-\nrising dangers that lack them, like climate change.\n7. In the USA today, government money is almost never\nspent to solve problems that are not yet causing pain.\nUnfortunately, the pain of climate change will be\ndelayed until long after the actions that cause it,\nsetting in fully only after the harm is done. If we\nwait to feel real pain before acting we may wait until\n\nthe catastrophe is unavoidable.\nOh dear. :-(\nKey readings: Frank, \"Small Price\"; Homer-Dixon, \"Terror\nin Weather Forecast\"; and Davenport, \"Climate Change.\"\nC. Managing emerging threats to public health:\na. Emerging natural diseases. The 1918 flu killed 675,000\nAmericans--more than World Wars I and II combined--and\n40-100 million people worldwide. AIDS has killed ~30\nmillion worldwide. The growing human intrusion into\nnatural habitats increase the danger of that new mass-\nkiller diseases will emerge; and the advance of\nmedicine promises new defenses against such diseases.\nDefeating such diseases requires international\ncooperation on public health. The danger they pose is\nan argument for preserving cooperation with other\nstates. Key reading: Troedsson and Rychener,\n\"Influenza Takes Flight.\"\nb. Emerging antibiotic resistant pathogens--a scary\nproblem that requires international solutions.\nD. Economic interests:\n1. Economic primacy: \"We must remain the #1 economy.\"\nQuestions:\na. What matters more: relative or absolute prosperity?\nb. How can relative prosperity be maximized? By hard-\nline (trade restrictions, subsidies to US\nindustries, etc.) or soft-line foreign economic\npolicies?\n2. Other interests: preserving access to raw materials?\nDefending US overseas investments? Promoting free\ntrade/fair trade?\nE. Defending America's cultural/historic kin: Israelis,\nPoles, Cubans, Georgians, S. Koreans, Africans.\nF. Miscellaneous: controlling drugs, migrants.\nV. A PRIMARY NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST, POST 9/11/01: THWARTING\nWMD TERROR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. BUT DOES THE U.S. HAVE A\nCOUNTER-TERROR STRATEGY?\nHow large is the terrorist threat? What should be US strategy\nvs. terror?\nA. The 9/11/01 attack convinced many people that the terrorist\nthreat was larger than previously believed.\n-- On 9/11 al-Qaeda showed considerable skill--far more\nthan other terrorist groups.\n-- Nuclear weapons and materials are less secure from\ntheft or purchase than they once were, due to\nPakistan's acquisition of nuclear weapons and the\ncollapse of the Soviet dictatorship in the USSR in\n1991.\n-- The al-Qaeda attack dramatized al-Qaeda's vast\ndestructive ambitions. Terrorism experts once argued\nthat terrorists only want large audiences, not large\nnumbers of dead. But former al-Qaeda spokesman\n\nSuleiman Abu Ghaith declared al-Qaeda's right to kill 4\nmillion Americans including two million children.\nB. Is the US succeeding against al-Qaeda? Does the US have a\nwinning strategy?\nAl-Qaeda has been weakened, especially by the U.S.\nkilling of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011 and the attrition\nof the al-Qaeda organization in Pakistan by drone strikes\nsince 2009. But AQ affiliates have sprouted since 9/11/01\nin Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, the Sinai, Mali,\nand Nigeria. Al-Qaeda spinoff ISIL controls much of Iraq\nand Syria. AQ affiliates al-Nusra and Khorasan pose a\ncurrent threat in Syria.\nThe al-Qaeda narrative remains widely believed in the\nMuslim world. Al-Qaeda & affiliates & similar groups\n(ISIL) will not be defeated until the al-Qaeda narrative\nis destroyed.\nVI. FIVE PRIME U.S. INTERESTS TODAY: AVERTING A EURASIAN HEGEMON\n(BUT THAT'S EASY); PREVENTING/DEFEATING CATASTROPHIC TERRORISM\n(SOME SAY THAT'S EASY TOO--IS IT?); CONTROLLING WMD SPREAD;\nPROTECTING GLOBAL COMMONS (ENVIRONMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH);\nPRESERVING WORLD ECONOMY.\nCan these five interests be protected without broad\ncooperation with other major states?\nVII. SIX CONTENDING GRAND STRATEGIES TODAY\nTwo grand strategies focused on other great powers:\n1. Isolation (Favored by: Ron & Rand Paul, strong\nlibertarians).\n2. Containment vs. China and/or Russia. \"China and/or\nRussia pose the greatest threat to U.S. national\nsecurity. The U.S. should contain their expansion.\nSpecifically, the U.S. should prevent Russia from\ncreating a sphere of influence in the Caucasus or\nUkraine; and should organize an encirclement of China,\ne.g., using India, Vietnam.\" (Favored by: John McCain;\nSteve Bannon (China only); implied by Obama pivot to\nAsia.)\nThree grand strategies focused on countering WMD terror. \"WMD\nterror poses the greatest threat to U.S. national security.\nAddressing this threat by countering its two prime elements-\nWMD proliferation and terrorist networks that have global\nambition and reach--should be America's top priority\":\n3. Containment vs. proliferators, state sponsors of\nterror, and terrorist movements. Use sieges and\ndeterrence to counter proliferator states (e.g., North\nKorea, Iran) and terrorist states and movements (e.g.,\nISIS in Iraq and Syria, al-Qaeda central in Pakistan,\nthe Taliban, AQAP in Yemen). \"We must contain and\nweaken bad actors by sieges, harassment, and sabotage\nwhile deterring their aggression. They will eventually\n\ncollapse or mellow.\" (Favored by: Obama, Biden.)\nBarry Posen's strategy of restraint is a tempered\nversion of strategies #2 and #3. Key reading on Posen:\nDizikes, \"Time to Rethink.\"\n4. Rollback vs. proliferators, state sponsors of terror,\nand terrorist movements. Move to conquer and/or\ndestroy proliferator states (e.g., North Korea, Iran)\nand terrorist states and movements (e.g., ISIS, al-\nQaeda central in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban, AQAP in\nYemen, Syria). \"We must conquer and/or destroy bad\nactors. Specifically, we mst remove and replace the\nregimes of proliferator states and state sponsors of\nterror; and destroy terrorist movements by conquering\nand policing their stomping grounds.\" (Favored by: Tom\nCotton, Lindsey Graham, William Kristol, Robert Kagan,\nTrump administration.)\n5. A Concert of major powers vs. proliferators, state\nsponsors of terror, terrorist networks, and climate\nchange. Forge cooperation with other major powers,\nincluding Russia and China, to defeat these threats.\n\"It's 1815 again. Other major powers no longer\nthreaten U.S. security because the nuclear revolution\nmakes conquest among major powers impossible. But WMD\nterror now poses a serious threat from below. It\nthreatens all powers and cannot be defeated without\ncooperation by most or all powers. Climate change also\nthreatens all states and cannot be stemmed without\ncommon action. Hence a concert of cooperation by all\npowers against WMD terror and climate change is\nfeasible and necessary.\"\n(Favored by: SVE, and Obama\nadministration at times.) (Key readings: Van Evera,\n\"American Foreign Policy for the New Era\"; and Sanger\nand Baker, \"Obama Reorients.\")\nA Concert strategy has two variants: Concert-by\ncontainment and Concert-by-rollback. The consensus\nthat a Concert requires is easier to achieve on\nConcert-by-containment.\nA hybrid strategy:\n6. Countering WMD terror plus ending unfair trade deals\nand ending illegal immigration.

      "content": "U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY & NUCLEAR POLICY, 1945-PRESENT\nI. HOW SHOULD THE UNITED STATES SET MILITARY REQUIREMENTS?\nBy answering five questions in sequence: (1) What are U.S.\nnational interests? (2) What threats to these interests can we\ndiscern? (3) What strategies would best address these threats?\n(4) What missions must the US military and/or other government\nagencies perform to support these strategies? (5) What forces\nor other assets are required to perform these missions? (A\nframework by Steven E. Miller.)\nII. FOUR KEY NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY ISSUES TODAY\nWhat strategy should the U.S. adopt to address the WMD terror\nthreat (al-Qaeda or ISIS with an a-bomb)? What capabilities\ndoes this strategy require? What changes are required to\ncreate these capabilities? For example: shift resources from\nthe Army, Navy and Air Force to intelligence (CIA and FBI)?\nTo nation building? To \"public diplomacy\" (shaping foreign\nopinion)? To locking down loose nukes around the world?\nHow should the U.S. address nuclear proliferation? By\npreventive war? By applying economic sanctions? By giving\nsecurity guarantees or economic bribes to potential\nproliferators? Pursue world disarmament? (On disarmament see\nassigned article by Carla Robbins, \"Thinking the\nUnthinkable.\")\n> When should the U.S. wage preventive war against emerging\nnuclear powers? Against which states? What forces does\nthis require? The 2002 U.S. National Security Strategy\nframed a doctrine of preventive war (see Lieber and Lieber,\nassigned earlier). Is this a good strategy?\nHow should the US respond to China's rise? By pursuing\ncontainment? Cooperation?\nShould the U.S. try to maintain a strategic nuclear first-\nstrike counterforce capability against China and Russia?\nToward this, should the U.S. develop a national missile\ndefense (NMD) system?\nHow should the U.S. address the possibility that emerging\ntechnologies will spread WMD-scope destructive powers to non\ndeterrable non-state actors (e.g., terrorists or psychopaths)?\n> What effects would follow if the Silex laser-enrichment\nprocess succeeds?\n> ... or the power to make ultra-lethal new bioweapons\nproliferates?\nCan we survive a world of \"a nuke in every garage,\" or \"a\nbioweapons lab in every garage\"? What can be done to avert\nit? See readings assigned for this week by Martin Rees, Henry\nKelly, Antonio Regalado and William Broad.\nIII. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON WMD POLICY\n\nWhich nuclear capabilities would be intolerable for the US in\nthe hands of which other states? Specifically:\n1. Which capabilities must the U.S. prevent other states from\ngaining?\n> A \"latent\" bomb--the capacity to build a bomb in a few\nmonths or years? (Example: Iran today, which has a latent\nbomb 1 year from completion.)\n> One or a few bombs that are unprotected from attack, and\ncould therefore be eliminated by a US first strike; and/or\nthat lack a delivery system required to detonate them in\nthe US or another foreign country? (Example: North Korea\ntoday; the USSR 1949-50).\n> A secure nuclear force that could survive a US first\nstrike and inflict unacceptable damage against the US in\nretaliation? (Example: the USSR 1965-89.)\n> A force that could destroy U.S. forces in a first strike?\n2. Which states must be prevented from gaining these\ncapabilities?\n> Britain/France? Israel? India? China? Russia?\n> \"Rogue states\" that aggress against neighbors, oppose US\nforeign policy, seek weapons of mass destruction (WMD),\ne.g., North Korea or Iran? Quasi-rogues like Pakistan?\nSaddam's Iraq before 2003?\nSome analysts say the key issue is: \"Is the regime\ndeterrable?\" Meaning, are they (1) Prone to misperceive\nothers' reactions to their actions? (2) Sensitive to costs?\n(3) Do they value conquest as highly as their own survival?\nIf so, big trouble!\n3. How to prevent unacceptable actors from gaining unacceptable\ncapabilities?\nIV. THE NUCLEAR REVOLUTION AND AMERICAN SECURITY\nThree questions: (1) What have been the effects of the nuclear\nrevolution on world politics and U.S. interests? (2) What\nstrategy should the U.S. adopt for the use of its nuclear\nforces, especially toward other current and future nuclear\npowers? (3) How should the US address the danger of nuclear\nproliferation?\nA. The evolution of the U.S. nuclear arsenal (see last page).\nB. The effects of the nuclear revolution: good or bad?\noffensive or defensive? Nuclear weapons have four cascading\neffects:\n1. Hydrogen bombs are more powerful by six (yes, six)\norders of magnitude compared to the TNT explosives used\nin World War II. Atomic bombs = x 1,000 increase on\nTNT; hydrogen bombs = x 1,000 increase on atomic bombs.\n2. Due to '1'--the destructiveness of nuclear weapons--the\n\"cost exchange ratio\" vastly favors defenders (better\ntermed \"retaliators\") over attackers seeking to disarm\nthem. Nuclear weapons pack tremendous explosive power\nin small, cheap, light devices that are easy to hide,\nprotect, and deliver. Hence destroying them is very\n\nhard, protecting and delivering them very easy.\n3. Due to '2'--the cost-exchange ratio--a relationship of\nMAD (\"Mutual Assured Destruction\") tends to develop\nbetween major powers. Both can destroy the other's\nsociety even after absorbing an all-out counterforce\nattack by the other.\n> The U.S.-Soviet relationship reached deep MAD in the\nmid-1960s.\n> The US-China and US-Russia relationships may not be at\nMAD today. This is because those states have made\nlittle effort to create secure arsenals. If they\ntried, they could do it.\n> The US-North Korea relationship is not at MAD. A US\nnuclear strike could very likely take out North\nKorea's nuclear force, precluding NK retaliation.\n4. \"Defense-dominance.\" Some argue that MAD strengthens\ndefender-states and weakens aggressor-states. Are they\nright?\nC. Alternate nuclear doctrines: Countervalue vs. Counterforce\nstrategies. Nuclear weapons present states with two basic\nnuclear doctrines toward other nuclear states: counterforce\nand countervalue.\n>> Countervalue: the enemy society is targeted. Political\naims are achieved by threatening to punish the adversary\nby destroying its population and industry.\n>> Counterforce: the enemy nuclear forces are targeted.\nPolitical aims are achieved by threatening to disarm the\nadversary--to remove its capacity to inflict punishment\non oneself.\nCounterforce forces include forces that could\npreempt the others' nuclear force (e.g., accurate\nintercontinental missiles) and defenses that could\ndestroy the other's retaliating weapons (e.g., national\nballistic missile defenses).\nSince forces can be used first or second, we have a crude\nuniverse of four possible nuclear capabilities:\n1. First-strike countervalue capability: the capacity to\nlaunch a first strike that inflicts unacceptable damage\non the adversary's society.\nThis capability is very easy to build, for reasons\nnoted above in Section IV B1-2, but is quite useless.\n2. Second-strike countervalue capability: the capacity to\nabsorb an all-out counterforce first strike and inflict\nunacceptable damage on the adversary's society in\nretaliation.\nThis capability is easy to build, for reasons noted\nabove in Section IV B1-3.\n3. First-strike counterforce: the capacity to launch a\nfirst strike that removes the adversary's capacity to\ninflict unacceptable damage on oneself in retaliation.\nThis capability is very hard or impossible to build,\nfor reasons noted above in Section IV B1-3.\n\n4. Second-strike counterforce capability: the capacity to\nabsorb an all-out counterforce first strike and mount a\ncounterforce counterattack that leaves the attacker's\nforces unable to inflict unacceptable further damage on\none's own society.\nThis capability is even harder to build than a\nfirst-strike counterforce capability.\nThese four capabilities can be displayed in a 2x2 table:\nStriking what?\nValues (cities)\nForces\n+))))))))))))))))0))))))))))))))))),\n*#1 First\n*#3 First\n*\n*\nStrike\n*\nStrike\n*\nFirst\n*\nCountervalue *\nCounterforce *\nStriking\n*\nCapability\n*\nCapability\n*\nWhen?\n/))))))))))))))))3)))))))))))))))))1\n*#2 Second\n*#4 Second\n*\nSecond\n*\nStrike\n*\nStrike\n*\n*\nCountervalue *\nCounterforce *\n*\nCapability\n*\nCapability\n*\n.))))))))))))))))2)))))))))))))))))\nCold War-era debates over US nuclear doctrine focused\non whether the US should be content with capability #2 (a\nsecond strike countervalue capability, or SSCVC) against the\nSoviet Union (SU), or should also strive for #3 (a first\nstrike counterforce capability, or FSCFC). Advocates of\npursuing an FSCFC said that it was achievable, and would\ndeter the SU more than it provoked the SU. Opponents of\npursuing an FSCFC said it was unachievable; and is\ninherently offensive, hence would provoke the SU to worse\nbehavior.\nCurrent debates over US nuclear doctrine focus on\nwhether the US should be content with a second strike\ncountervalue capability against China and Russia, or should\nalso work to maintain a first strike counterforce\ncapability.\nDebates over US foreign policy also focus on whether\nthe US should allow Iran, North Korea, and other states to\ngain capability #1, a first strike countervalue capability.\nA fifth capability can also be distinguished: a \"latent\nbomb,\" meaning, the capability to make a bomb in the near\nfuture. Debates also focus on whether the U.S. should allow\nthis latent capability in bad hands.\nD. COUNTERVALUE vs. COUNTERFORCE STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS:\nWHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?\n> Second-strike countervalue nuclear forces can survive a\nsurprise attack and retaliate against the attacker's cities\nor other \"value\" targets.\n\nAn example of a pure second-strike countervalue weapon\nin the 1960s-1980s era: the U.S. Polaris ballistic missile\nsubmarine fleet. Polaris subs could hide from Soviet attack\nin the vast ocean and their missiles could strike Soviet\ncities, but these missiles lacked the accuracy to destroy\nSoviet hardened nuclear forces.\n> First-strike counterforce nuclear forces can be used to\ndestroy an opponent's nuclear forces in a first strike.\nAn example of a pure first-strike counterforce weapon\nis a highly accurate intercontinental ballistic missile\n(ICBM) based in a vulnerable soft silo. It could be used to\nlaunch a surprise attack on another state's ICBMs or command\ncenters, but it could not survive an attack to retaliate\nagainst the attacker's cities.\nOther forces that contribute to a first-strike\ncounterforce capability include \"killer\" submarines designed\nto locate and sink other submarines, which can be used to\ndestroy ballistic missile submarines (if the opponent has\nthem); and area ballistic missile defenses (often called\n\"national missile defense,\" or \"NMD\") deployed to protect\ncities. The role of NMD in a first strike would be to knock\ndown warheads missed by the first strike that are\nretaliating against the attacker's cities. In this role NMD\nis the defensive half of a first strike system and thus is\nessentially offensive despite its defensive appearance.\nMany weapons have both second strike countervalue and\nfirst strike counterforce characteristics--they contribute\nto both second-strike countervalue and first-strike\ncounterforce capabilities.\nE. THREE DANGERS THAT OTHER STATES' NUCLEAR FORCES COULD POSE\nWhy are other states' nuclear forces scary?\n1. A nuclear-armed state might use its weapons.\n2. A nuclear-armed state might be emboldened to adopt more\naggressive policies, believing that its nuclear weapons\nprotected it from retaliation.\n3. A nuclear-armed state might by incompetence or\ninadvertence allow its nuclear weapons to be stolen,\nbought or transferred to bad actors, especially\nterrorists.\nV. THE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS REVOLUTION AND AMERICAN NATIONAL\nSECURITY\nBioweapons differ from nuclear weapons in five prime regards:\nA. Biological weapons are cheap to make and can be made or\npurchased by non-state actors--that is, by terrorists.\n> Moreover, bioweapons may grow much more lethal in the\nfuture as new super-pathogens are engineered by scientists\nexploiting new genetic engineering techniques.\nB. Biological weapons programs have no clear signature that\ndistinguishes them from peaceful biological research. As a\nresult an arms control regime that bans bioweapons is\n\nprobably impossible to devise.\nC. Biological weapons can more easily be used anonymously.\nD. Defenses are more feasible against bio attack than against\nnuclear attack--but the attacker still has a large\nadvantage.\nE. Contagious bioweapons can spread unpredictably, harming the\nuser's friends/family/army/society. Hence their use can be\nirrational.\nAs a result of factors 'A' 'B' and 'C' some argue that\nbioweapons are weapons from hell as perhaps their use cannot be\ndeterred and cannot be defeated, while their power will only\ngrow. If so, we face big trouble ahead.\nIn Kurt Vonnegut's 1963 novel Cat's Cradle a mad scientist\ninvents a new crystalline form of water, \"ice nine,\" that\nsolidifies at 90 degrees fahrenheit. Its release ends life on\nearth by freezing the oceans. Is the biotechnology revolution\nhanding us a biotechnical ice nine--a vastly destructive\ntechnology for which we are socially, politically and morally\nunready? Will it doom us?1\nIn 2016 Director of National Intelligence Thomas Clapper\nwarned specifically that a powerful new gene-editing tool,\nCRISPR, might someday be used by bad actors to make ultra-\nlethal ultra-contagious new pathogens. Hence, said Clapper,\nCRISPR poses a threat to US national security. See assigned\nreading by Antonio Regalado.\nMartin Rees, in Our Final Hour (assigned), argues more\ngenerally that vast destructive powers are spreading to\nindividual terrorists or psychopaths. The answer must be the\nend of human privacy, to ensure that no lunatic can secretly\nmake a superkiller bug in his or her basement.\nWhat can we do to avert this threat? Can we slow or channel\nthe process of scientific discovery away from inventing these\nhorrors? For example, should biologists agree to regulations\nthat limit their research, to avoid inventing superkilling\nagents? Or must curiosity inexorably kill the cat (us)? Or\ndoes Rees overstate this danger?\nIs bioscience bringing this nightmare alive?\nVI. A SECOND NUCLEAR REVOLUTION? WILL THE POWER TO MAKE NUCLEAR\nWEAPONS SPREAD TO CRAZY STATES AND TERRORISTS?\nGeneral Electric and Hitachi have reportedly developed a new\nmeans to enrich uranium. Enriching uranium is the key step in\nmaking an atomic bomb. The GE/Hitachi Silex process allows\nenrichment in a small, low-cost facility. This will put atomic\nbombs in close reach of crazy states and terrorists. Is Rees's\nnightmare coming true? Have the people at GE and Hitachi taken\n1 Herman Kahn once likewise warned that if a $10 \"Doomsday\nMachine\" is ever devised civilization is doomed because someone\nwill eventually use such a cheap machine, regardless of\ncountermeasures. Oh dear.\n\nleave of their senses? Inquiring minds want to know.\nVII. SOVIET MILITARY DOCTRINE, 1947-1989: OFFENSE AND PREEMPTION.\n(PRETTY CRAZY! WHY ADOPTED?)\nVIII. THE U.S. DEFENSE DEBATE, 1947-1989\nA. America's prime problem: defending Western Europe from\nSoviet conquest.\nB. The \"how to defend Europe\" debate, 1947-1989: 7 contending\nstrategies:\n1. Strategic nuclear countervalue: threaten to punish\nSoviets by blasting their cities if they invade Western\nEurope.\n2. Strategic nuclear counterforce: threaten to disarm &\nconquer Soviets if they invade. (Adopted by Eisenhower,\n1953-61, under doctrine of \"Massive Retaliation\".)\n3. Theater nuclear denial: threaten to incinerate invading\nSoviet armies. (Adopted briefly in late 1950s.)\n4. Conventional denial: thwart invading Soviet armies with\nconventional forces. (Preferred by US, 1960s-1970s, but\nvetoed by Germany.)\n5. Conventional offense: seize Soviet territory if they\ninvade.\n6. German nuclear deterrent: let Germans threaten to blast\nSoviet cities. (Eisenhower favored, JFK opposed.)\n7. Tripwire strategy: spring-load a European war to make it\nuncontrollable. US goal: Conventional war ---> theater\nnuclear war ---> general thermonuclear war. (Actual\nUS/NATO declaratory strategy, 1967-1989.)\nC. The Third World intervention debate (The \"how to contain\"\ndebate recast).\nIX. NONPROLIFERATION/COUNTERPROLIFERATION: NINE STRATEGIES\nA. Technology denial. Make it hard for the proliferator to\nacquire needed technology for nuke-making.\nB. Economic sanctions: threaten or impose them.\nC. Bribery: bribe the potential proliferator to eschew nukes.\n(See Robert Reardon's research on this.)\nD. Sabotage: Stuxnet their equipment, kill their scientists.\nE. Create legal framework to assign civil liability for lost\nnukes to the states that lose them. This threatens\npotential proliferators with vast lawsuits if they ever lose\ncontrol of a nuke. This will make their business community\nquestion whether going nuke is a good idea.\nF. Give security guarantees to potential proliferators (as the\nUS has given guarantees to Taiwan, South Korea, Germany,\nJapan, and others).\nG. Conventional preventive war.\n1. Focused only on destroying proliferators nuclear\ninfrastructure, e.g., Israel's Osiraq raid.\n2. Focused on regime change in the proliferator state.\nH. Nuclear preventive war.\n\n--------------------------------\nI. Threaten to hold at risk the potential proliferator's\nnuclear forces by maintaining a first-strike counterforce\ncapability, in order to devalue the proliferator's potential\nnuclear force. \"You will never have a meaningful, useable\nnuclear capability, as we will maintain the capacity to\ndisarm you.\"\nADDENDUM #1: US Nuclear Weapons Inventory:\n1945: 2\n1946: 9\n1947: 13\n1948: 50\n1950: At least 292\n1953: 1500\n1959: 6000\n1991: 18000\nSources for 1945-1950: David Alan Rosenberg, \"U.S. Nuclear\nStockpile, 1945 to 1950,\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, May\n1982, pp. 25-30.
