The\nvalues are pulse-shape specific, and follow from the Fourier transform relation\nor the uncertainty principle, as the case may be.\nThe following are amplitude functions of a pulse in the time domain, in\ncomplex notation:\nf(t) = f0 ·\nμ\n1 - t2\nτ 2\n¶\ne iω0t\nfor\n|t| ≤ τ\n(1)\nf(t) = 0\nfor\n|t| ≥ τ\n(2)\n(a) Sketch the intensity function f(t) 2 and calculate the full width at half\n|\n|\nmaximum (FWHM) Δt of the intensity function.\n(b) Calculate the Fourier transform f (ω). Sketch the power spectrum f (ω)\n|\n|\nand identify the full width at half maximum Δν = Δω/2π. (Hint: In\ntroduce the variable x = (ω - ω0)τ and calculate Δx numerically.)\n(c) Calculate the time-bandwidth product Δν Δt for this pulse shape.\n·\nProblem 1.2: Gires-Tournois Interferometer\nGires-Tournois Interferometer (GTI) is essentially a Fabry-Perot resonator\nwith a 100% reflector. As with an ideal high-reflectivity mirror, the whole\nreflectivity of the device stays 100%. In contrast, the phase delay is, as with\na Fabry-Perot, frequency-dependent. Thus the GTI can be used in a laser\nresonator for dispersion compensation.\nUsing r1 = -√R1, r2 = -√R2 = -1 and assuming that medium 2 has a\nrefractive index 1, the following expression for the amplitude reflectivity can\nbe found:\n\n-√R1 + e-i2βd\nrGT I = 1 -√R1e-i2βd\n(3)\nwhere β = 2π/λ and d is the thickness of Medium 2.\n(a) The relationship between intensity reflectivity R and amplitude reflec\ntivity r is R = r 2 . Show that the intensity reflectivity RGT I is 100%,\n| |\nas long as there is no absorption or other loss in Medium 2.\n(b) Calculate the phase ΦGT I from rGT I and introduce ωt0 = 2βd (t0 is the\nround-trip time in Medium 2) in your final answer.\n(c) Calculate the group delay Tg =\n∂ΦGT I and the group delay dispersion\n∂ω\n-\nDg = ∂Tg .\n∂ω\nFrom Problem (d) to Problem (h), suppose the thickness of Medium 2 is\nd = 150 μm and the reflectivity at the interface between medium 1 and\n2 is R1 = 4 %.\n(d) Plot Tg and Dg as functions of wavelength λ in the band from 798 nm\nto 803 nm.\n(e) From the answer of (d), in which wavelength range can the GTI be used\nfor dispersion compensation inside a laser resonator? Note that the laser\ncrystals and air have positive group velocity dispersions.\n(f ) Suppose a 100-fs long Gaussian-shaped optical pulse (peak intensity is\nnormalized to 1) centered at λ = 800 nm is reflected from the interface\nbetween medium 1 and 2 at t = 0. At t = 10 ps, how will the reflected\npulse look like? Sketch the pulse at this point in time and specify as\nmany numeric values as possible.\n(g) Now suppose a 10-ps long Gaussian-shaped optical pulse (peak intensity\nis normalized to 1) centered at λ = 800 nm is reflected from the interface\nbetween medium 1 and 2 at t = 0. At t = 20 ps, how will the reflected\npulse look like? Sketch the pulse at this point in time and specify as\nmany numeric values as possible.\n(h) The answers for Problems (f) and (g) will look quite different. Briefly\nexplain the reason in the frequency and/or time domains.\nProblem 1.3: Kramers-Kr onig Relations\nThe linear dielectric susceptibility is the dielectric response of a medium to\nan applied electric field, i.e. it is the response of a causal linear time invariant\nsystem, and therefore real and imaginary parts obey Kramers-Kr onig relations:\n2 Zinf\nωχi(ω)\nχr(Ω) =\nω2 - Ω2 dω = nr(Ω) - 1\n(4)\nπ\n\n¿\nand\n2 Zinf\nΩχr (ω)\nχi(Ω) = - π\nω2 - Ω2 dω,\n(5)\nwhere the complex susceptibility is χ(Ω) = χr (Ω) - jχi(Ω).\n(a) Using causality, prove the Kramers-Kr onig relations. (Hint: A causal\nsignal can be multiplied by a step function without changing.)\n(b) Suppose you know χi(Ω) for the whole frequency range. Then it might\nlook easy to use Eqs. (4) and (5) to evaluate χr (Ω). But in fact, you will\nfind the singularity in the denominator makes it difficult to numerically\nintegrate those equations. How can you circumvent that problem and\ncompute χr (Ω) from χi(Ω)? (Hint: Think about the symmetries of the\nreal and imaginary parts of the complex susceptibility.)\n(c) How would you compute the refractive index of a medium, nr (Ω) =\nn0 + Δnr (Ω) (where Δnr\nn0), if its absorption coefficient α(Ω) is\nknown over the whole frequency range? Assume the absorption is weak,\ni.e. χi << 1 + χr and the background index n0 is known.\n|\n|"

For dispersion compensation in and outside laser resonators, one often uses a\nsequence of prisms or gratings, which deliver the required negative second-order dis\npersion through geometric effects (differences in transit time). Although the derivation\nprocess might involve quite lengthy calculations, it will be helpful to analyze them\nyourself for future design of laser resonators or external compression experiments.\nThe following references will be helpful:\nE. B. Treacy, \"Optical pulse compression with diffraction gratings\", IEEE J. Quant.\nElectron. 5, 454 (1969).\nStuart D. Brorson and Hermann A. Haus, \"Geometrical limitations in grating pair\npulse compression\", Appl. Opt. 27, 23 (1988).\nH. A. Haus, Waves and Fields in Optoelectronics, Chapter 6.6.\nR. L. Fork, O. E. Martinez, and J. P. Gordon, \"Negative dispersion using pairs of\nprisms\", Opt. Lett. 9, 150 (1984).\nProblem 2.1: Diffraction Grating Pair\n(a) Derive from simple geometric principles a condition for the angle θr of maximum\ndiffraction, as a function of the wavelength λ, the incident angle θi, the grating\nperiod Λ, and the diffraction order m. Based on your answer, for which diffraction\norders can the grating pair be used for generation of negative dispersion?\n(b) In schematic 1 the x-plane is defined by beginning and end of the optical path\npopt = PABQ of an infinitely thin laser beam that is normal to the plane. Cal\nculate this optical path as a function of λ, θr , θi, the diffraction order m, and the\n\nB\nD\nF\nG\nH\nE\nA\nC\nß\nrot\nblau\nL\na\nf1\nf2\nf 1'\nf 2'\ngrating distance Lg . What is the phase delay Φopt corresponding to this optical\npath?\n(c) Considering the finite beam cross-section, as indicated in schematic 2, an addi\ntional phase shift Φc must be added to account for the phase-matching provided\nby the grating. Schematic 2 shows that this adjustment is necessary, because\nthe planes (CE) and (DE) represent planes with constant phase, and the grating\nmust compensate the extra paths δi = CB and δr = BD travelled by the lower\npart of the beam with an appropriate phase shift. Deduce, again from geometric\nconsiderations, similar to part (a), this phase shift Φc as a result of phase match\ning! What is the total phase shift Φ = Φopt + Φc? That is, calculate the phase\nshift from the total path difference. (It is essential here to observe the correct\nchoice of signs!). (For more details consult the book by H. A. Haus: Waves and\nFields in Optoelectronics, Chapter 2.6).\n∂Tg\n(d) Calculate the group delay Tg = ∂Φ and the second-order dispersion D2 =\n.\n∂ω\n∂ω\nWhat is the dispersion relation for a four-grating compressor? For what reason\nis a second grating pair used?\n(e) Example: Laser pulses with 200 fs duration at a center wavelength of 800 nm\nshall be delivered to a medical imaging system through a 1 m long quartz fiber.\nTo avoid broadening of the pulse the second order dispersion of the fiber link shall\nbe compensated with grating pairs. Two grating pairs with 600 grooves per mm\nare given and shall be used at an angle of incidence of 50 degrees. What grating\ndistance is necessary to compensate the second-order dispersion of the fiber when\nthe grating is optimized for the diffraction order m = -1 (Blazed Grating)?\nProblem 2.2: Prism Pair\n(a) For calculation of the optical path difference in prism pairs, the path CB = L is\nthe reference path. Argue that the optical path CDE = AB and EFG = BH.\nThe difference in the distance travelled by different frequency components arises\ntherefore only from the length CDE. Give an expression for the optical path\nlength P = CDE as a function of L and β.\n\n(b) Rewrite the second derivative of P with respect to λ in known quantities, by\nconsidering P as a function of β(n(λ)) (Repreated application of the chain rule!)\nTake the dispersion relation n(λ) as given.\n(c) Determine from the geometry of a prism (Prism schematic 2) the dependence of\nthe angle of reflection Φ2 of the transmitted beam on the index of refraction n\nand calculate the first and second derivatives. (Hint: Take the angle of incidence\nΦ1 as fixed and calculate the angle Φ2 as a function of the inner diffraction angles\nΦ0 and Φ2\n0 as shown in Prism diagram 2.)\n(d) What is the first and second derivative of β, considering the symmetric beam\npath and operation at Brewster's angle (Hint: There is a simple relationship\nbetween the the first derivative of β and Φ2) ?\nCombine the results of parts (a) through (d) to find the dispersion formula\n∂2Φ(ω)/∂ω2 for a four prism compressor. What is it?\n(e) To a first approximation, l sin β ≈ 2mm (somewhat larger than the spot size of\na typical beam), and cos β ≈ 1. What prism distance (from apex-to-apex) is\nnecessary to compensate the positive dispersion from a Ti:Sapphire laser crystal\nof about 300 fs2?\n∂n\n∂2n\n(Quartz prism: n(0.8μm) = 1.4535, ∂λ (0.8μm) = -0.017 1 , ∂λ2 (0.8μm) = 0.04\n2 )\nμm\nμm"

In this Problem, Rabi oscillation with detuning\nwill be studied.\nA two-level system with a dipole matrix element M = e0 < g ~x e > and\n| |\n< g ~x e > = 0.5 nm, is driven by a monochromatic laser field polarized par\n|\n| |\n|\nallel to M, such that the Rabi-frequency Ωr /2π is 10 GHz. The frequency of\nthe laser field is not equal to the atomic transition frequency, which shall be\nf0 =c/(800 nm). The energy and phase relaxation rates of the transition shall\nbe much longer than a nanosecond.\n(a) How strong is the electric field (in V/cm) required for these conditions?\nWhat is the intensity (in W/cm2) of the laser beam and the power (in\nW) of the laser, if the laser beam is focused to a 5 μm diameter spot\nsize?\n(b) Determine the population in the excited state of the atom after switch\ning on the laser field for 1 nanosecond for arbitrary detuning (denote\ndetuning as Δ) between laser field and atomic transition. Assume that\ninitially all atoms are in the ground state. It might be easy to start from\nEqs. (2.86) and (2.87) of the lecture note.\n(c) Plot the dynamics for population of the two levels and dipole moment\n(in C ·m) of the atom for 100 picoseconds, if the detuning between drive\nlaser and atomic transition is as large as the Rabi-frequency.\n(d) From the plot of Problem 3.1 (c), can you mention the main differences\ncompared to the case without detuning? Is the fast oscillation (inside\nthe envelope) in dipole moment visible from this plot?\nProblem 3.2: Power Broadening\nThe absorption of an atomic vapor modelled by a two-level atom is mea\nsured with a tunable laser. The spectroscopic data of the transition, i.e. the\nlinewidth of the transition and its saturation intensity, shall be determined.\n(a) The absorption profile is measured by scanning the tunable laser over\nthe absorption line at very low intensities. Which information about the\noptical transition can you extract from this measurement?\n\n(b) The measurement in (a) is repeated at various power levels of the tun\nable laser. How does the shape of the measured absorption line change\nwith the power level? Which information can you extract from this\nmeasurement?\n(c) Now a second powerful laser is focused into the vapor with an intensity\nI = 10 Is. The measurement in (a) is repeated with the tunable laser\n·\nat low intensity. What lineshape do you find? (Assume that (i) the\nspot size of the tunable laser beam is much smaller than the one of the\npowerful laser beam, (ii) they are centered at the same point, and (iii)\nthere is no problem in separating both beams after propagation through\nthe vapor.)\nProblem 3.3: Pulse Compression\nA pulse propagating through an optical fiber becomes frequency modulated\ndue to self-phase modulation (SPM). The pulse is chirped and can be repre\nsented by\niω0t = e-Γt2\niω0t\nA(t) = e-Γ1t2 e-iΓ2t2 e\ne\n(1)\n·\n·\n·\nwith Γ = Γ1 + iΓ2, where Γ1 determines the initial pulse width and Γ2 the\nacquired chirp due to SPM (in this Problem, assume Γ2 is positive). The pulse\ncan be compressed by the addition of dispersion generated by a grating pair\nor prism pair (as discussed in Problem Set 2)\niD2(ω-ω0)2\nA0(ω) = A(ω) · e\n.\n(2)\n(a) What is the new value for Γ0 of the new pulse in terms of Γ1, Γ2 and D2?\nIn the following we assume that the input pulse is a Gaussian pulse\n(i.e. Γ1 = 1/2τ 2) and we take the action of self-phase modulation into\naccount by expanding the nonlienar phase shift up to second order in\ntime, so that equation (1) can be applied.\n(b) What is the peak nonlinear phase shift, φ0 = -Γ2τ 2, necessary to short\nening of the pulse by a factor of two (in terms of FWHM of the intensity)?\n(c) What is the necessary dispersion to compress the pulse? Express the\nfinal answer in terms of τ . Can you find the reason why making negative\ndispersion with an artificial structure, such as prism-pair, grating-pair,\nor chirped mirror (which will be shown later in the class), is important\nin pulse compression?\nProblem 4.0: In the next Problem Set, you will be asked to write a\nsimple program to simulate (1) the pulse compression and (2) the nonlinear\nSchr odinger equation for solitons. The \"official language\" for the simulation\nproblems in this course will be MATLAB. Please indicate if you are familiar\nwith MATLAB for this kind of problems. If you prefer to use another language,\nplease mention which one you will use."

Plot the pulse shape (in the time\ndomain) and corresponding amplitude spectra (in the frequency domain)\nas a function of propagation distance, similar to those shown in Chapter\n3.\nProblem 4.2: Rate Equations for the Four-Level Laser\nAs an example for a four-level laser material we consider the transition of\nNd:YAG at λ0 = 1.064 μm. With a diode laser at 0.8 μm the 4F5/2 level can\nbe pumped from the ground state 4I9/2. We assume that fast relaxation rates\nlead to efficient excitation transfer from the pump level to the upper laser\nlevel 4F3/2 and from the lower laser level 4I11/2 to the ground state 4I9/2, i.e.\nwe assume γ32, γ10 A γ21. The cross section for stimulated emission between\nlevel 2 and 1 is given by σ12 = σ = 6.5 × 10-19cm . The pump rate RP is\nassumed to be constant. The transition rates between the levels are denoted\nby γij = T\nij .\nFigure 1: The four levels in Nd:YAG related to lasing at 1064 nm\n(a) Write down the four rate equations for the four-level laser system shown\nin Figure 1 using the level populations N2 and the photon density nL,\ncross section σ and the group velocity vg of the laser light.\n\n(b) Write down the rate equations for the photon density nL and intensity\nI ∝ nL in the resonator mode. For simplicity assume that the effective\ncross section of the laser mode Aef f is same everywhere in the resonator.\nThe resonator length is L.\n(c) In general γ32, γ10 are fast relaxation rates much faster than any other\nprocesses in the system. Therefore, the populations N3 and N1 always\nrelax quasi instantaneously into the steady state determined by the val\nues for intensity I and population N2. Eliminate the fast populations\nN3 and N1 and derive a rate equation for N2 - N1. Assume that the\npopulation in the ground state never gets depleted."

The first fiber is a highly nonlinear fiber and the second fiber\nis with large negative dispersion. The fiber parameters are following.\nFiber 1: β2 = 20 ps2/km; γ = 60 W-1km-1; Length = 2.08 m.\nFiber 2: β2 = -40 ps2/km; γ = 3 W-1km-1; Length = 1.20 m.\nwhere β2 = 2D2 is GVD parameter and γ = δ/Aeff is nonlinear coefficient.\nSimilar to Problem 4.1, we can use the split-step Fourier method to simulate\nthis process. In order to simulate with real parameters, the following NLSE\ncan be used instead of the normalized NLSE:\n∂A\n∂z = ( ˆD + ˆN)A\n(1)\nwhere\nˆD = j β2\n∂2\n∂T 2\n(2)\nand\nˆN = -jγ|A| 2\n(3)\nIn addition, A is normalized such that A 2 represents the optical power in\n| |\nthe fiber, T is the retarded time frame, and z is the distance.\nThe initial pulse is given as:\nt\nA(t) =\np\nP0e\n-\n2T 2\n(4)\nwhere P0 = 400 W and T0=0.6 ps (this is equivalent to TFWHM = 1 ps for\nGaussian pulse).\nUsing a similar program as in Problem 4.1, simulate this pulse compression\nprocess.\n(a) Plot the pulse amplitude evolution in time domain for each fiber (the\ninitial pulse is entering Fiber 1 first. The output pulse from Fiber 1 is\nentering Fiber 2).\n\n(b) Plot the pulse amplitude evolution in frequency domain for each fiber\n(the initial pulse is entering Fiber 1 first. The output pulse from Fiber\n1 is entering Fiber 2).\nSuggestion: since the pulse width is in the ps range, it may be easier to\nnormalize all the time units in ps and frequency units to THz.\nProblem 5.2: Relaxation Oscillations\nWe consider a continuously operating Ti:sapphire laser at a wavelength of\nλ0 = 0.8 μm, 100 MHz repetition rate, pumped with 5 W power. The laser\nthreshold is 0.5 W. The upper state lifetime of Ti:sapphire is 2.5 μs and a 10%\noutput coupler is used.\n(a) Is the relaxation oscillation in this laser over- or under-damped?\n(b) What is the relaxation oscillation frequency and the damping rate of the\nrelaxation oscillations as a function of the pump parameter r?\n(c) Plot the root locus of the complex relaxation oscillation frequency as a\nfunction of the pump parameter. What is the result for the pumping\nconditions described above?\n(d) How much pump power is required to suppress relaxation oscillations?"

In the next Problem\nSet, we will see how the Kerr-lens effect in the laser crystal can change the\nresonator condition and provide an artificial saturable absorption effect.\nGain Medium: The Ti:sapphire crystal will be used for the gain medium.\nThe gain bandwidth of Ti:sapphire is Ωg = 2π × 43 THz with a center wave\nlength of 800 nm. The crystal length is t = 2 mm. The refractive index of\nthe crystal is 1.76 at 800 nm. For a rough estimation of the pulsed operation,\nassume the fast saturable absorber coefficient γ and the self-phase modulation\ncoefficient δ are: γ = 10-7/W and δ = 10-6/W.\nResonator: We will use a 4-mirror resonator structure discussed in the\nclass. The radius of curvature of R1 and R2 is R1 = R2 = 10 cm. The arm\nlengths are L1 = 80 cm and L2 = 60 cm. Assume the mirrors except output\ncoupler have 100 % reflectivity with zero dispersion in the Ti:sapphire gain\nbandwidth range. The output coupler is 2% one and also has no dispersion.\nDispersion Compensation: To obtain short pulses from this laser the\ndispersion of the Ti:sapphire crystal has to be compensated. For a dispersion\ncompensation we will put a prism pair (refer to Problem 2.2 again) in the longer\narm (L1). The prisms are cut at Brewster's angle for the center wavelength of\n800 nm. The beam at center wavelength 800 nm also defines the prism angle\nβ = 0.\n\n(a) Determine the astigmatism compensation angle θastig.\n(b) The Ti:sapphire crystal will be placed at the intra-cavity focus between\ncurved mirrors. For 9 cm ≤ d ≤ 12 cm range, plot the focus size w0\nand the focus position x as a function of d for (i) tangential and (ii)\nsagittal planes as well as (iii) the case neglecting astigmatism (that is,\nf1,2 = R1,2/2). To simplify the calculation, neglect the thickness and\nrefractive index of the Ti:sapphire crystal.\n(c) What prism separation, L, would you choose for three different prism\nmaterials, (i) quartz, (ii) SF10 and (iii) CaF2, to compensate the second-\norder dispersion of Ti:sapphire crystal? The material parameters at\n∂n\n0.8μm are: Ti:sapphire: ∂2 n = 0.064 μm2 , Quarz: ∂λ = -0.017\n, SF10:\n∂λ2\nμm\n∂n\n∂n\n∂λ = -0.05 1 , CaF2: ∂λ = -0.01\nμm\nμm\n(d) How large is the remaining third-order dispersion for the different prism\nmaterials? Use the following material parameters for 0.8μm: Ti:sapphire:\n∂2n\n∂3 n = -0.377 μm3 , Quarz: ∂2n = 0.04 μm2 , SF10:\n= 0.18 μm2 , CaF2:\n∂λ3\n∂λ2\n∂λ2\n∂2 n = 0.031 1\n2 .\n∂λ2\nμm\nNote, for computation of the third-order dispersion use the result for ∂2P\n∂λ2 ,\nwhere P is the optical path length through the prism pair from Problem\n2.2. The term proportional to sin β can be neglected and, therefore, the\nn\ncoefficient ∂3\noccurring for the prism pair is not necessary.\n∂λ3\n(e) The lengthening of the pulse due to third-order dispersion in the absence\nof second-order dispersion can be approximated by\nτout\ns\nμ 8\n√\n2 ln 2 ∂3Φ ¶2\n=\n1 +\n(1)\nτ 3\nτin\nin\n∂ω3\nWhich prism material would you use to minimize the effects of third-\norder dispersion?\n(f ) How much would a 15 fs pulse be stretched within one round-trip in the\ncavity due to the remaining third-order dispersion?\nIn the following we neglect third and higher order dispersion. Assume\nthe average output power is 100 mW and the repetition rate is 100 MHz.\n(g) Assume that the pulses are soliton like. What is the necessary net intra-\ncavity dispersion for generating a 10 fs pulse from this laser? How large\nis then the normalized dispersion, Dn = D2/Dg?\n(h) How large is the chirp on the steady-state pulse without assuming a\nsoliton-like pulse?"

In this\nProblem, we will evaluate how an additional Kerr-Lens in the gain medium\naffects the resonator mode. Figure 1 a)-d) shows the procedure.\nIn the class, we already derived the equivalent two-mirror resonator shown\nin c). The Kerr lens with assumed focal length fK that is building up in\nthe center of the gain medium at high intensities will change the mode size\nin the resonator and also changes the stability range of the resonator as a\nfunction of the distance L between the two focusing mirrors and the distance\nX between the center of the Kerr-Medium to the pump mirror with radius R2.\nOne can also use the distance L0 between the folding mirror images in c) and\nthe corresponding distance of the crystal x to the image of the pump mirror.\nThe following parameters are same as those in Problem 8.1: R1 = R2 = 10\ncm and L1 = 80 cm and L2 = 60 cm. The gain medium is modelled only as a\nfixed Kerr lens with focal length fK . The thickness of the gain medium shall\nbe neglected for the following.\n(a) Compute the parameters of the equivalent two-mirror cavity shown in\nFigure 1 c).\n(b) The part of the resonator to the left of the center of the Kerr Lens can\nbe replaced by an equivalent mirror R00\n1 at a distance D1, see Figure 1 d).\nThe same can be done for the right part of the resonator.

Discuss this beam size variations in the context of\nKerr-lens mode locking.\n(e) How would you align the focus of the pump beam, and with it the lo\ncation of the gain region inside the laser crystal, to achieve maximum\nequivalent saturable absorber action by the Kerr lensing effect?

BLOCH EQUATIONS\n2.3\nBloch Equations\nAtoms in low concentration show line spectra as found in gas-, dye- and some\nsolid-state laser media. Usually, there are infinitely many energy eigenstates\nin an atomic, molecular or solid-state medium and the spectral lines are\nassociated with allowed transitions between two of these energy eigenstates.\nFor many physical considerations it is already sufficient to take only two of\nthe possible energy eigenstates into account, for example those which are\nrelated to the laser transition. The pumping of the laser can be described\nby phenomenological relaxation processes into the upper laser level and out\nof the lower laser level. The resulting simple model is often called a two-\nlevel atom, which is mathematically also equivalent to a spin 1/2 particle\nin an external magnetic field, because the spin can only be parallel or anti-\nparallel to the field, i.e. it has two energy levels and energy eigenstates. The\ninteraction of the two-level atom or the spin with the electric or magnetic\nfield is described by the Bloch equations.\n2.3.1\nThe Two-Level Model\nAn atom having only two energy eigenvalues is described by a two-dimensional\nstate space spanned by the two energy eigenstates |e > and |g >. The two\nstates constitute a complete orthonormal system. The corresponding energy\neigenvalues are Ee and Eg (Fig. 2.2).\nFigure 2.2: Two-level atom\nIn the position-, i.e. x-representation, these states correspond to the wave\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nfunctions\nψe(x) =< x|e >,\nand ψg(x) =< x|g > .\n(2.38)\nThe Hamiltonian of the atom is given by\nHA = Ee|e >< e| + Eg|g >< g|.\n(2.39)\nIn this two-dimensional state space only 2×2 = 4 linearly independent linear\noperators are possible. A possible choice for an operator base in this space is\n1 = |e >< e| + |g >< g|,\n(2.40)\nσz = |e >< e| - |g >< g|,\n(2.41)\nσ+ = |e >< g|,\n(2.42)\nσ- = |g >< e|.\n(2.43)\nThe non-Hermitian operators σ± could be replaced by the Hermitian oper\nators σx,y\nσx = σ+ + σ- ,\n(2.44)\nσy = -jσ+ + jσ- .\n(2.45)\nThe physical meaning of these operators becomes obvious, if we look at the\naction when applied to an arbitrary state\n|ψ >= cg|g > + ce|e > .\n(2.46)\nWe obtain\nσ+|ψ\n>\n= cg|e >,\n(2.47)\nσ-|ψ\n>\n= ce|g >,\n(2.48)\nσz|ψ\n>\n= ce|e > -cg|g > .\n(2.49)\nThe operator σ+ generates a transition from the ground to the excited state,\nand σ- does the opposite. In contrast to σ+ and σ- , σz is a Hermitian\noperator, and its expectation value is an observable physical quantity with\nexpectation value\n< ψ|σz|ψ >= |ce|2 - |cg|2 = w,\n(2.50)\nthe inversion w of the atom, since |ce|2 and |cg|2 are the probabilities for\nfinding the atom in state |e > or |g > upon a corresponding measurement.\n\n2.3. BLOCH EQUATIONS\nIf we consider an ensemble of N atoms the total inversion would be σ =\nN < ψ|σz|ψ >. If we separate from the Hamiltonian (2.38) the term (Ee +\nEg)/2 ·1, where 1 denotes the unity matrix, we rescale the energy values\ncorrespondingly and obtain for the Hamiltonian of the two-level system\nHA = ~ωegσz,\n(2.51)\nwith the transition frequency\nωeg = 1(Ee - Eg).\n(2.52)\n~\nThis form of the Hamiltonian is favorable. There are the following commu\ntator relations between operators (2.41) to (2.43)\n[σ+ , σ-]\n=\nσz,\n(2.53)\n[σ+ , σz]\n=\n-2σ+ ,\n(2.54)\n[σ- , σz]\n=\n2σ- ,\n(2.55)\nand anti-commutator relations, respectively\n[σ+ , σ-]+ =\n1,\n(2.56)\n[σ+ , σz]+ =\n0,\n(2.57)\n[σ- , σz]+ =\n0,\n(2.58)\n[σ- , σ-]+ =\n[σ+, σ+]+ = 0.\n(2.59)\nThe operators σx, σy, σz fulfill the angular momentum commutator relations\n[σx, σy]\n=\n2jσz,\n(2.60)\n[σy, σz]\n=\n2jσx,\n(2.61)\n[σz, σx]\n=\n2jσy.\n(2.62)\nThe two-dimensional state space can be represented as vectors in C2 accord\ning to the rule:\nμ\n¶\nc\n|ψ >= ce|e > + cg|g > →\ne\n.\n(2.63)\ncg\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nThe operators are then represented by matrices\nμ\n¶\nσ+\n→\n,\n(2.64)\nμ 0\n0 ¶\nσ-\n→\n,\n(2.65)\nμ 1\n¶\nσz\n→\n,\n(2.66)\n-1\nμ\n¶\n→\n.\n(2.67)\n\n2.3.2\nThe Atom-Field Interaction In Dipole Approxi\nmation\nThe dipole moment of an atom p is essentially determined by the position\noperator x via\np = -e0 x.\n(2.68)\nThen the expectation value for the dipole moment of an atom in state (2.46)\nis\n|2\n∗\n< ψ|p|ψ > =\n-e0(|ce\n< e|x|e > +cecg < g|x|e >\n(2.69)\n∗\n|2\n+\ncgc < e|x|g > +|cg\n< g|x|g >).\ne\nFor simplicity, we may assume that that the medium is an atomic gas. The\natoms posses inversion symmetry, therefore, energy eigenstates must be sym\nmetric or anti-symmetric, i.e. < e|x|e >=< g|x|g >= 0. We obtain\n< ψ|p|ψ >= -e0 (cec ∗\ng < g|x|e > +cgc ∗\ne < g|x|e >\n∗ ).\n(2.70)\n(Note, this means, there is no permanent dipole moment in an atom, which\nis in an energy eigenstate. Note, this might not be the case in a solid. The\natoms consituting the solid are oriented in a lattice, which may break the\nsymmetry. If so, there are permanent dipole moments and consequently the\nmatrix elements < e|x|e > and < g|x|g > would not vanish.

MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nFigure 2.3: Evolution of occupation probabilities of ground and excited state\nand the average dipole moment of a two-level atom in resonant interaction\nwith a coherent classical field.\nThe coherent external field drives the population of the atomic system\nbetween the two available states with a period Tr = π/Ωr. Applying the field\nonly over half of this period leads to a complete inversion of the population.\nThese Rabi-oscillations have been observed in various systems ranging from\ngases to semiconductors. Interestingly, the light emitted from the coherently\ndriven two-level atom is not identical in frequency to the driving field. If\nwe look at the Fourier spectrum of the polarization according to Eq.(2.95),\nwe obtain lines at frequencies ω± = ωeg ± 2Ωr. This is clearly a nonlinear\noutput and the sidebands are called Mollow-sidebands [2] . Most important\nfor the existence of these oscillations is the coherence of the atomic system\nover at least one Rabi-oscillation. If this coherence is destroyed fast enough,\nthe Rabi-oscillations cannot happen and it is then impossible to generate\ninversion in a two-level system by interaction with light. This is the case for\na large class of situations in light-matter interaction. So we are interested\nwhat happens in the case of loss of coherence due to additional interaction\n\n2.3.

The main di\nagonal contains the population probabilities for the levels and the off-diagonal\nelement is the expectation value of the positive or negative frequency compo\nnent of the dipole moment of the atom, i.e. its contribution to the medium\npolarization.\nThe expectation value of an arbitrary operator A can be computed using\nthe trace formula\n< A >= Tr{ρA } =< ψ|A|ψ > .\n(2.99)\nThe advantage of the density operator is, that mixtures of pure states can\nalso be treated in a statistical sense. For example, if the atom is in state |e >\nwith probability pe and in state |g > with probability pg a density operator\nρ = pe|e >< e| + pg|g >< g|\n(2.100)\nis defined, which can be used to compute the average values of observables\nin the proper statistical sense\n< A >= Tr{ρA} = pe < e|A|e > +pg < g|A|g > .\n(2.101)\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nSince the matrices (2.64) to (2.67) build a complete base in the space of\n2 × 2-matrices, we can express the density matrix as\nρ = ρee (1 + σz) + ρgg (1 - σz) + ρegσ+ + ρgeσ-\n(2.102)\n=\n1 1 + 1(ρ - ρ )σ + ρ σ+ + ρ σ- ,\n(2.103)\nee\ngg\nz\neg\nge\nsince the trace of the density matrix is always one (normalization).

Indeed in our case we are interested with\na radiating atom, i.e. it has a dipole interaction with the field. The coupling\nwith the infinitely many modes of the free field leads already to spontaneous\nemission, an irreversible process. We could treat this process by using the\nHamiltonian\nH = HA + HF + HA-F .\n(2.114)\nHere, HA is the Hamiltonian of the atom, HF of the free field and HA-F\ndescribes the interaction between them. A complete treatment along these\nlines is beyond the scope of this class and is usually done in classes on Quan\ntum Mechanics. But the result of this calculation is simple and leads in the\nvon Neumann equation of the reduced density matrix, i.e. the density ma\ntrix of the atom. With the spontaneous emission rate 1/τ sp,i.e. the inverse\nspontaneous life time τ sp, the populations change according to\nd\nd\n|ce(t)|2 =\nρ = -Γeρ + Γaρ\n(2.115)\nee\nee\ngg\ndt\ndt\nwith the abbreviations\nΓe =\n(nth + 1),\n(2.116)\nτ sp\nΓa =\nnth.\n(2.117)\nτ sp\nHere, nth is the number of thermally excited photons in the modes of the free\nfield with frequency ωeg, nth = 1/(exp(~ωeg/kT ) - 1), at temperature T .\n\nCHAPTER 2.

T2 is the correlation time between amplitudes\nce and cg. This coherence is destroyed by the interaction of the two -level\nsystem with the environment. In this model the energy relaxation is half the\nphase relaxation rate or\nT2 = 2T1.\n(2.124)\nThe atoms in a laser medium do not only interact with the electromagnetic\nfield, but in addition also with phonons of the host lattice, they might col\nlide with each other in a gas laser and so on. All these processes must be\n\n2.3. BLOCH EQUATIONS\nconsidered when determining the energy and phase relaxation rates. Some\nof these processes are only destroying the phase, but do actually not lead to\nan energy loss in the system. Therefore, these processes reduce T2 but have\nno influence on T1. In real systems the phase relaxation time is most often\nmuch shorter than twice the energy relaxation time,\nT2 ≤ 2T1.\n(2.125)\nIf the inversion deviates from its equilibrium value w0 it relaxes back into\nequilibrium with a time constant T1. Eq. (2.123) shows that for all tem\nperatures T > 0 the inversion is negative, i.e. the lower level is stronger\npopulated than the upper level. Thus with incoherent thermal light inver\nsion in a two-level system cannot be achieved. Inversion can only be achieved\nby pumping with incoherent light, if there are more levels and subsequent\nrelaxation processes into the upper laser level. Due to these relaxation pro\ncesses the rate Γa deviates from the equilibrium expression (2.117), and it\nhas to be replaced by the pump rate Λ. If the pump rate Λ exceeds Γe, the\ninversion corresponding to Eq. (2.123) becomes positive,\nΛ - Γe\nw0 =\n.\n(2.126)\nΛ + Γe\nIf we allow for artificial negative temperatures, we obtain with T < 0 for the\nratio of relaxation rates\nΓe\n1 + n\n~ ωeg\n=\n= e\nkT < 1.\n(2.127)\nΓa\nn\nThus the pumping of the two-level system drives the system far away from\nthermal equilibrium, which has to be expected.\n2.3.6\nThe Two-Level Atom with a Coherent Classical\nExternal Field\nIf there is in addition to the coupling to an external heat bath, which models\nthe spontaneous decay, pumping, and other incoherent processes, a coherent\nexternal field, the Hamiltonian has to be extended by the dipole interaction\nwith that field,\nHE = -pE(xA, t).\n(2.128)\n\nCHAPTER 2.

The\nderivative of the phase with respect to time is the instantaneous frequency\nFig. 2.10(b). It indicates, that the low frequencies are in the front of the\npulse, whereas the high frequencies are in the back of the pulse. This is due\nto the positive dispersion k00 > 0, which causes, that wave packets with lower\nfrequencies travel faster than wave packets with higher frequencies.\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Therefore,\nthe wave equation (2.184) also treats the case of a complex refractive index.\nIf we assume a medium with the complex refractive index (2.187), then the\nwave number is given by\n-10\n-5\n-10\n-5\n¶\nμ\nΩ\n(2.191)\nK(Ω) =\n1 +\n(χ (Ω) + jχi(Ω)) .\nc0\nr\nSince we introduced a complex wave number, we have to redefine the group\nvelocity as the inverse derivative of the real part of the wave number with\nrespect to frequency.

MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nvacuum. The opposite is true for an inverted, and therefore, amplifying\ntransition, α < 0. There is nothing wrong with it, since the group velocity\nonly describes the motion of the peak of a Gaussian wave packet, which is\nnot a causal wave packet. A causal wave packet is identical to zero for some\nearlier time t < t0, in some region of space. A Gaussian wave packet fills the\nwhole space at any time and can be reconstructed by a Taylor expansion at\nany time. Therefore, the tachionic motion of the peak of such a signal does\nnot contradict special relativity.\nThe imaginary part in the wave vector (2.191), due to gain and loss, has\nto be completely treated in the envelope equation (2.184).

The basic model for the medium is\nthe two-level atom discussed before with infinitely long relaxation times T1,2,\ni.e. assuming that the pulses are much shorter than the dephasing time in the\nmedium. In such a medium pulses exist, where the first half of the pulse fully\ninverts the medium and the second half of the pulse extracts the energy from\nthe medium. The integral over the Rabi-frequency as defined in Eq.(2.39) is\nthan a mutiple of 2π. The interested reader is refered to the book of Allen\nand Eberly [1]. Here, we are interested in the nonlinear dynamics due to\nthe Kerr-effect which is most important for understanding pulse propagation\nproblems in optical communications and short pulse generation.\n3.1\nThe Optical Kerr-effect\nIn an isotropic and homogeneous medium, the refractive index can not de\npend on the direction of the electric field. Therefore, to lowest order, the\nrefractive index of such a medium can only depend quadratically on the\nfield, i.e. on the intensity [22]\nn = n(ω, |A|2) ≈ n0(ω) + n2,L|A|2 .\n(3.1)\nHere, we assume, that the pulse envelope A is normalized such that |A|2 is\nthe intensity of the pulse. This is the optical Kerr effect and n2,L is called\n\nCHAPTER 3.

Note, the nonlinear in\ndex depends on the polarization of the field and without going further into\ndetails, we assume that we treat a linearily polarized electric field. For most\ntransparent materials the intensity dependent refractive index is positive.\n3.2\nSelf-Phase Modulation (SPM)\nIn a purely one dimensional propagation problem, the intensity dependent\nrefractive index imposes an additional self-phase shift on the pulse envelope\nduring propagation, which is proportional to the instantaneous intensity of\nthe pulse\n∂A(z, t) = -jk0n2,L|A(z, t)|2A(z, t) = -jδ|A(z, t)|2A(z, t).\n(3.2)\n∂z\nwhere δ = k0n2,L is the self-phase modulation coefficient. Self-phase modu\nlation (SPM) leads only to a phase shift in the time domain. Therefore, the\nintensity profile of the pulse does not change only the spectrum of the pulse\nchanges, as discussed in the class on nonlinear optics. Figure (3.1) shows\nthe spectrum of a Gaussian pulse subject to SPM during propagation (for\nδ = 2 and normalized units). New frequency components are generated by\nthe nonlinear process via four wave mixing (FWM). If we look at the phase of\nthe pulse during propagation due to self-phase modulation, see Fig. 3.2 (a),\nwe find, that the pulse redistributes its energy, such that the low frequency\ncontributions are in the front of the pulse and the high frequencies in the\nback of the pulse, similar to the case of positive dispersion.\n\nSpectrum\n3.2.

THE NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION\n3.3\nThe Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation\nIf both effects, dispersion and self-phase modulation, act simultaneously on\nthe pulse, the field envelope obeys the equation\n∂A(z, t)\n∂2A\nj\n= -D2\n+ δ|A|2A,\n(3.3)\n∂z\n∂t2\nThis equation is called the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NSE) - if we\nput the imaginary unit on the left hand side -, since it has the form of a\nSchrodinger Equation. Its called nonlinear, because the potential energy\nis derived from the square of the wave function itself. As we have seen\nfrom the discussion in the last sections, positive dispersion and positive self-\nphase modulation lead to a similar redistribution of the spectral components.\nThis enhances the pulse spreading in time. However, if we have negative\ndispersion, i.e. a wave packet with high carrier frequency travels faster than\na wave packet with a low carrier frequency, then, the high frequency wave\npackets generated by self-phase modulation in the front of the pulse have\na chance to catch up with the pulse itself due to the negative dispersion.\nThe opposite is the case for the low frequencies. This arrangement results\nin pulses that do not disperse any more, i.e. solitary waves. That negative\ndispersion is necessary to compensate the positive Kerr effect is also obvious\nfrom the NSE (3.3). Because, for a positive Kerr effect, the potential energy\nin the NSE is always negative. There are only bound solutions, i.e. bright\nsolitary waves, if the kinetic energy term, i.e. the dispersion, has a negative\nsign, D2 < 0.\n3.3.1\nThe Solitons of the NSE\nIn the following, we study different solutions of the NSE for the case of\nnegative dispersion and positive self-phase modulation. We do not intend\nto give a full overview over the solution manyfold of the NSE in its full\nmathematical depth here, because it is not necessary for the following. This\ncan be found in detail elsewhere [4, 5, 6, 7].\nWithout loss of generality, by normalization of the field amplitude A =\nq\nA\n2D2\nτ\nδ , the propagation distance z = z · τ 2/D2, and the time t = t · τ,\nthe NSE (3.3) with negative dispersion can always be transformed into the\n\nCHAPTER 3.

For the numerical simulations,\nwhich are shown in the next chapters, we simulate the normalized eq.(3.4)\nand the axes are in normalized units of position and time.\n3.3.2\nThe Fundamental Soliton\nWe look for a stationary wave function of the NSE (3.3), such that its absolute\nsquare is a self-consistent potential. A potential of that kind is well known\nfrom Quantum Mechanics, the sech2-Potential [8], and therefore the shape of\nthe solitary pulse is a sech\nμ ¶\nt\nAs(z, t) = A0sech\ne -jθ,\n(3.5)\nτ\nwhere θ is the nonlinear phase shift of the soliton\nθ = 1 δA2\n0z\n(3.6)\nThe soltion phase shift is constant over the pulse with respect to time in\ncontrast to the case of self-phase modulation only, where the phase shift is\nproportional to the instantaneous power. The balance between the nonlinear\neffects and the linear effects requires that the nonlinear phase shift is equal\nto the dispersive spreading of the pulse\n|D2|\nθ =\nz.\n(3.7)\nτ 2\nSince the field amplitude A(z, t) is normalized, such that the absolute square\nis the intensity, the soliton energy fluence is given by\nZ inf\nw =\n|As(z, t)|2dt = 2A2τ.\n(3.8)\n-inf\nFrom eqs.(3.6) to (3.8), we obtain for constant pulse energy fluence, that the\nwidth of the soliton is proportional to the amount of negative dispersion\n4|D2|\nτ =\n.\n(3.9)\nδw\n\n3.3.

The distance, after which the soliton aquires a phase shift of\nπ/4, is called the soliton period, for reasons, which will become clear in the\nnext section.\nSince the dispersion is constant over the frequency, i.e. the NSE has\nno higher order dispersion, the center frequency of the soliton can be chosen\narbitrarily. However, due to the dispersion, the group velocities of the solitons\nwith different carrier frequencies will be different. One easily finds by a\nGallilei tranformation to a moving frame, that the NSE posseses the following\ngeneral fundamental soliton solution\n-jθ(z,t)\nAs(z, t) = A0sech(x(z, t))e\n,\n(3.11)\n\nCHAPTER 3.

Only the soliton area is fixed. The energy fluence and\nwidth are determined if one of them is specified, given a certain dispersion\nand SPM-coefficient.\n3.3.3\nHigher Order Solitons\nThe NSE has constant dispersion, in our case negative dispersion. That\nmeans the group velocity depends linearly on frequency. We assume, that\ntwo fundamental soltions are far apart from each other, so that they do not\ninteract. Then this linear superpositon is for all practical purposes another\nsolution of the NSE. If we choose the carrier frequency of the soliton, starting\nat a later time, higher than the one of the soliton in front, the later soliton\nwill catch up with the leading soliton due to the negative dispersion and the\npulses will collide.\nFigure 3.4 shows this situation. Obviously, the two pulses recover com\npletely from the collision, i.e. the NSE has true soliton solutions. The solitons\nhave particle like properties. A solution, composed of several fundamental\nsolitons, is called a higher order soliton. If we look closer to figure 3.4, we\nrecognize, that the soliton at rest in the local time frame, and which follows\nthe t = 0 line without the collision, is somewhat pushed forward due to the\ncollision. A detailed analysis of the collision would also show, that the phases\nof the solitons have changed [4]. The phase changes due to soliton collisions\nare used to built all optical switches [10], using backfolded Mach-Zehnder in\nterferometers, which can be realized in a self-stabilized way by Sagnac fiber\nloops.\n\n3.3.

THE NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION\nThe NSE also shows higher order soliton solutions, that travel at the same\nspeed, i.e. they posses the same carrier frequency, the so called breather\nsolutions. Figures 3.5(a) and (b) show the amplitude and spectrum of such\na higher order soliton solution, which has twice the area of the fundamental\nsoliton. The simulation starts with a sech-pulse, that has twice the area of\nthe fundamental soliton, shown in figure 3.3. Due to the interaction of the\ntwo solitons, the temporal shape and the spectrum exhibits a complicated but\nperiodic behaviour. This period is the soliton period z = π/4, as mentioned\nabove. As can be seen from Figures 3.5(a) and 3.5(b), the higher order\nsoliton dynamics leads to an enormous pulse shortening after half of the\nsoliton period. This process has been used by Mollenauer, to build his soliton\nlaser [11]. In the soliton laser, the pulse compression, that occures for a\nhigher order soliton as shown in Fig. 3.5(a), is exploited for modelocking.\nMollenauer pioneered soliton propagation in optical fibers, as proposed by\nHasegawa and Tappert [3], with the soliton laser, which produced the first\npicosecond pulses at 1.55 μm. A detailed account on the soliton laser is given\nby Haus [12].\nSo far, we have discussed the pure soliton solutions of the NSE. But,\nwhat happens if one starts propagation with an input pulse that does not\ncorrespond to a fundamental or higher order soliton?\n3.3.4\nInverse Scattering Theory\nObviously, the NSE has solutions, which are composed of fundamental soli\ntons. Thus, the solutions obey a certain superposition principle which is\nabsolutely surprising for a nonlinear system. Of course, not arbitrary super\npositions are possible as in a linear system. The deeper reason for the solution\nmanyfold of the NSE can be found by studying its physical and mathemat\nical properties. The mathematical basis for an analytic formulation of the\nsolutions to the NSE is the inverse scattering theory [13, 14, 4, 15]. It is a\nspectral tranform method for solving integrable, nonlinear wave equations,\nsimilar to the Fourier transform for the solution of linear wave equations [16].\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nFigure 3.6: Fourier transform method for the solution of linear, time invariant\npartial differential equations.\nFigure 3.7: Schematic representation of the inverse scattering theory for the\nsolution of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations.\nLet's remember briefly, how to solve an initial value problem for a linear\npartial differential equation (p.d.e.), like eq.(2.184), that treats the case of\na purely dispersive pulse propagation. The method is sketched in Fig. 3.6.\nWe Fourier tranform the initial pulse into the spectral domain, because, the\nexponential functions are eigensolutions of the differential operators with\n\n3.3. THE NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION\nconstant coefficients. The right side of (2.184) is only composed of powers of\nthe differntial operator, therefore the exponentials are eigenfunctions of the\ncomplete right side. Thus, after Fourier transformation, the p.d.e. becomes\na set of ordinary differential equations (o.d.e.), one for each partial wave.\nThe excitation of each wave is given by the spectrum of the initial wave.\nThe eigenvalues of the differential operator, that constitutes the right side\nof (2.184), is given by the dispersion relation, k(ω), up to the imaginary\nunit. The solution of the remaining o.d.e is then a simple exponential of the\ndispersion relation. Now, we have the spectrum of the propagated wave and\nby inverse Fourier transformation, i.e. we sum over all partial waves, we find\nthe new temporal shape of the propagated pulse.\nAs in the case of the Fourier transform method for the solution of linear\nwave equations, the inverse scattering theory is again based on a spectral\ntransform, (Fig.3.7). However, this transform depends now on the details\nof the wave equation and the initial conditions. This dependence leads to\na modified superposition principle. As is shown in [7], one can formulate\nfor many integrable nonlinear wave equations a related scattering problem\nlike one does in Quantum Theory for the scattering of a particle at a poten\ntial well. However, the potential well is now determined by the solution of\nthe wave equation. Thus, the initial potential is already given by the ini\ntial conditions. The stationary states of the scattering problem, which are\nthe eigensolutions of the corresponding Hamiltonian, are the analog to the\nmonochromatic complex oscillations, which are the eigenfunctions of the dif\nferential operator. The eigenvalues are the analog to the dispersion relation,\nand as in the case of the linear p.d.e's, the eigensolutions obey simple linear\no.d.e's.\nA given potential will have a certain number of bound states, that cor\nrespond to the discrete spectrum and a continuum of scattering states. The\ncharacteristic of the continuous eigenvalue spectrum is the reflection coef\nficient for waves scatterd upon reflection at the potential. Thus, a certain\npotential, i.e. a certain initial condition, has a certain discrete spectrum and\ncontinuum with a corresponding reflection coefficient. From inverse scatter\ning theory for quantum mechanical and electromagnetic scattering problems,\nwe know, that the potenial can be reconstructed from the scattering data,\ni.e. the reflection coefficient and the data for the discrete spectrum [?]. This\nis true for a very general class of scattering potentials. As one can almost\nguess now, the discrete eigenstates of the initial conditions will lead to soliton\nsolutions. We have already studied the dynamics of some of these soliton so\n\nAmplitude\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nlutions above. The continuous spectrum will lead to a dispersive wave which\nis called the continuum. Thus, the most general solution of the NSE, for\ngiven arbitrary initial conditions, is a superposition of a soliton, maybe a\nhigher order soliton, and a continuum contribution.\nThe continuum will disperse during propagation, so that only the soliton\nis recognized after a while. Thus, the continuum becomes an asympthotically\nsmall contribution to the solution of the NSE. Therefore, the dynamics of\nthe continuum is completely discribed by the linear dispersion relation of the\nwave equation.\nThe back transformation from the spectral to the time domain is not as\nsimple as in the case of the Fourier transform for linear p.d.e's. One has to\nsolve a linear integral equation, the Marchenko equation [17]. Nevertheless,\nthe solution of a nonlinear equation has been reduced to the solution of two\nlinear problems, which is a tremendous success.\n2.5\n1.5\n0.5\n0.2\n0.4\nDistance z\n0.6\n0.8\n-2\nTime\n-4\nFigure 3.8: Solution of the NSE for an unchirped and rectangular shaped\ninitial pulse.\n\n3.4. UNIVERSALITY OF THE NSE\nTo appreciate these properties of the solutions of the NSE, we solve the\nNSE for a rectangular shaped initial pulse. The result is shown in Fig. 3.8.\nThe scattering problem, that has to be solved for this initial condition,\nis the same as for a nonrelativistic particle in a rectangular potential box\n[32]. The depth of the potential is chosen small enough, so that it has only\none bound state. Thus, we start with a wave composed of a fundamental\nsoliton and continuum. It is easy to recognize the continuum contribution,\ni.e. the dispersive wave, that separates from the soliton during propagation.\nThis solution illustrates, that soliton pulse shaping due to the presence of\ndispersion and self-phase modulation may have a strong impact on pulse\ngeneration [18]. When the dispersion and self-phase modulation are properly\nadjusted, soliton formation can lead to very clean, stable, and extremly short\npulses in a modelocked laser.\n3.4\nUniversality of the NSE\nAbove, we derived the NSE in detail for the case of disperison and self-phase\nmodulation. The input for the NSE is surprisingly low, we only have to\nadmitt the first nontrivial dispersive effect and the lowest order nonlinear\neffect that is possible in an isotropic and homogeneous medium like glass,\ngas or plasmas. Therefore, the NSE and its properties are important for\nmany other effects like self-focusing [19], Langmuir waves in plasma physics,\nand waves in proteine molecules [20]. Self-focusing will be treated in more\ndetail later, because it is the basis for Kerr-Lens Mode Locking.\n3.5\nSoliton Perturbation Theory\nFrom the previous discussion, we have full knowledge about the possible\nsolutions of the NSE that describes a special Hamiltonian system. However,\nthe NSE hardly describes a real physical system such as, for example, a real\noptical fiber in all its aspects [21, 22]. Indeed the NSE itself, as we have\nseen during the derivation in the previous sections, is only an approximation\nto the complete wave equation. We approximated the dispersion relation\nby a parabola at the assumed carrier frequency of the soliton. Also the\ninstantaneous Kerr effect described by an intensity dependent refractive index\nis only an approximation to the real χ(3)-nonlinearity of a Kerr-medium [23,\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\n24]. Therefore, it is most important to study what happens to a soliton\nsolution of the NSE due to perturbing effects like higher order dispersion,\nfinite response times of the nonlinearites, gain and the finite gain bandwidth\nof amplifiers, that compensate for the inevitable loss in a real system.\nThe investigation of solitons under perturbations is as old as the solitons\nitself. Many authors treat the perturbing effects in the scattering domain\n[25, 26]. Only recently, a perturbation theory on the basis of the linearized\nNSE has been developed, which is much more illustrative then a formulation\nin the scattering amplitudes. This was first used by Haus [27] and rigorously\nformulated by Kaup [28]. In this section, we will present this approach as\nfar as it is indispensible for the following.\nA system, where the most important physical processes are dispersion\nand self-phase modulation, is described by the NSE complimented with some\nperturbation term F\n∙\n\n∂A(z, t)\n∂2A\n= -j |D2|\n+ δ|A|2A + F(A, A ∗ , z).\n(3.14)\n∂z\n∂t2\nIn the following, we are interested what happens to a solution of the full\nequation (3.14) which is very close to a fundamental soliton, i.e.\n∙\n\nt\n-jksz\nA(z, t) = a( ) + ∆A(z, t) e\n.\n(3.15)\nτ\nHere, a(x) is the fundamental soliton according to eq.(3.5)\nt\nt\na( ) = A0 sech( ),\n(3.16)\nτ\nτ\nand\nks = 1 δA2\n(3.17)\nis the phase shift of the soliton per unit length, i.e. the soltion wave vector.\nA deviation from the ideal soliton can arise either due to the additional\ndriving term F on the right side or due to a deviation already present in\nthe initial condition. We use the form (3.15) as an ansatz to solve the NSE\nto first order in the perturbation ∆A, i.e. we linearize the NSE around the\nfundamental soliton and obtain for the perturbation\n∙μ\n¶\n\n∂∆A\n∂2\n= -jks\n- 1 ∆A + 2sech2(x) (2∆A + ∆A ∗ )\n∂z\n∂x2\n+F(A, A ∗ , z)ejksz ,\n(3.18)\n\n3.5. SOLITON PERTURBATION THEORY\nwhere x = t/τ. Due to the nonlinearity, the field is coupled to its complex\nconjugate. Thus, eq.(3.18) corresponds actually to two equations, one for the\namplitude and one for its complex conjugate. Therefore, we introduce the\nvector notation\nμ\n¶\n∆A =\n∆\n∆\nA\nA\n∗\n.\n(3.19)\nWe further introduce the normalized propagation distance z0 = ksz and the\nnormalized time x = t/τ. The linearized perturbed NSE is then given by\n∂\n∆A = L∆A +\nF(A, A ∗ , z)ejz0\n(3.20)\n∂z0\nks\nHere, L is the operator which arises from the linearization of the NSE\n∙\n\n∂2\nL = -jσ3 (\n- 1) + 2 sech2(x)(2 + σ1) ,\n(3.21)\n∂x2\nwhere σi, i = 1, 2, 3 are the Pauli matrices. For a solution of the inhomoge\nneous equation (3.20), we need the eigenfunctions and the spectrum of the\ndifferential operator L. We found in section 3.3.2, that the fundamental soli\nton has four degrees of freedom, four free parameters. This gives already four\nknown eigensolutions and mainsolutions of the linearized NSE, respectively.\nThey are determined by the derivatives of the general fundamental soliton\nsolutions according to eqs.(3.11) to (3.13) with respect to free parameters.\nThese eigenfunctions are\nfw(x)\n=\n\nfθ(x)\n=\n\nfp(x)\n=\n\nft(x)\n=\n\nμ\n(1 - x tanh x)a(x)\nw\nμ\n¶\n-ja(x)\n,\n-1\nμ\n¶\n-j xτa(x)\n,\n-1\nμ\n¶\ntanh(x) a(x)\n,\nτ\n¶\n,\n(3.22)\n(3.23)\n(3.24)\n(3.25)\nand they describe perturbations of the soliton energy, phase, carrier frequency\nand timing.

SOLITON PERTURBATION THEORY\nEquations (3.26) and (3.28) indicate, that perturbations in energy and\ncarrier frequency are converted to additional phase and timing fluctuations\nof the pulse due to SPM and GVD. This is the base for soliton squeezing in\noptical fibers [27]. The timing and phase perturbations can increase without\nbounds, because the system is autonomous, the origin for the Gordon-Haus\neffect, [29] and there is no phase reference in the system. The full continuous\nspectrum of the linearized NSE has been studied by Kaup [28] and is given\nby\nLfk = λkfk,\n(3.30)\nλk = j(k2 + 1),μ\n-jkx\nfk(x) = e\n(k - jtanhx)\nsech2 x\n¶\n,\n(3.31)\n(3.32)\nand\nL fk\n\n= λkfk,\n(3.33)\nλk = -j(k2 + 1),\n(3.34)\nfk = σ1fk.\n(3.35)\nOur definition of the eigenfunctions is slightly different from Kaup [28], be\ncause we also define the inner product in the complex space as\nZ +inf\n< u|v >= 1\nu +(x)v(x)dx.\n(3.36)\n-inf\nAdopting this definition, the inner product of a vector with itself in the\nsubspace where the second component is the complex conjugate of the first\ncomponent is the energy of the signal, a physical quantity.\nThe operator L is not self-adjoint with respect to this inner product. The\nphysical origin for this mathematical property is, that the linearized system\ndoes not conserve energy due to the parametric pumping by the soliton.\nHowever, from (3.21) and (3.36), we can easily see that the adjoint operator\nis given by\nL+ = -σ3Lσ3,\n(3.37)\nand therefore, we obtain for the spectrum of the adjoint operator\n(+)\n(+) (+)\nL+f\n= λ\nf\n,\n(3.38)\nk\nk\nk\n(+)\nλk\n= -j (k2 + 1),\n(3.39)\nf(+) =\nσ3fk,\n(3.40)\nk\nπ(k2 + 1)2\n\nCHAPTER 3.

Due to the low repetitionrate, a rather large pulse\nenergy builts up in the cavity, which leads to a large nonlinear phase shift\nper roundtrip.Figure 3.12 shows the spectrum of the output from the laser.\nThe Kelly sidebands are clearly visible. It is this kind of instability, which\nlimits further increase in pulse energy from these systems operating in the\nsoliton pulse shaping regime.

PULSE COMPRESSION\n3.7\nPulse Compression\nSo far we have discussed propagation of a pulse in negative dispersive media\nand positive self-phase modulation. Then at large enough pulse energy a\nsoliton can form, because the low and high frequency components generated\nby SPM in the front and the back of the pulse are slow and fast and therefore\ncatch up with the pulse and stay together. What happens if the dispersion\nis positive? Clearly, the low and high frequency components generated by\nSPM in the front and back of the pulse are fast and slow and move away from\nthe pulse in a continuous fashion. This leads to highly but linearly chirped\npulse, which can be compressed after the nonlinear propagation by sending\nit through a linear negative dispersive medium or prism pair or grating pair.\nIn that way, pulses can be compressed by large factors of 3 to 20. This pulse\ncompression process can be formulated in a more general way.\n3.7.1\nGeneral Pulse Compression Scheme\nThe general scheme for pulse compression of optical pulses was independently\nproposed by Gires and Tournois in 1964 [38] and Giordmaine et al. in 1968\n[39]. The input pulse is first spectrally broadened by a phase modulator. The\nphase over the generated spectrum is hopefully in a form that can be con\nveniently removed afterwards, i.e. all spectral components can be rephased\nto generate a short as possible pulse in the time domain. To compress fem\ntosecond pulses an ultrafast phase modulator has to be used, that is the pulse\nhas to modulate its phase itself by self-phase modulation. In 1969 Fisher et\nal. [40] proposed that picosecond pulses can be compressed to femtosecond\nduration using the large positive chirp produced around the peak of a short\npulse by SPM in an optical Kerr liquid. In the same year Laubereau [41] used\nseveral cells containing CS2 and a pair of diffraction gratings to compress, by\napproximately ten times, 20-ps pulses generated by a mode-locked Nd:glass\nlaser.\nAs discussed in section 3.2, the optical Kerr effect in a medium gives\nrise to an intensity dependent change of the refractive index ∆n = n2,LI(t),\nwhere n2,L is the nonlinear-index coefficient and I(t) is the optical inten\nsity. The self-induced intensity-dependent nonlinear phase shift experienced\nby an optical field during its propagation in a Kerr medium of length c is\ngiven by ∆φ(t) = -(ω0/c)n2I(t)c where ω0 is the carrier frequency of the\npulse. The induced frequency sweep over the pulse can be calculated from\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nNakatsuka, H., D. Grischkowsky, and A. C. Balant. \"Nonlinear picosecond-pulse propagation through\noptical fibers with positive group velocity dispersion.\" Physics Review Letters 47 (1981): 910-913.\nFigure 3.13: Intensity profile, spectrum, instantaneous frequency, optimum\nquadratic compression and ideal compression for two cases: top row for a\nshort fiber, i.e. high nonlinearity and low dispersion; bottom row optimum\nnonlinearity and dispersion.[42]\n∆ω = d∆φ/dt, see Figure 3.13. Around the central part of the pulse, where\nmost of the energy is concentrated, the phase is parabolic, leading to an\napproximately linear chirp in frequency. The region with linear chirp can\nbe enlarged in the presence of positive dispersion in a Kerr medium of the\nsame sign [42]. To compress the spectrally broadened and chirped pulse,\na dispersive delay line can be used, characterized by a nearly linear group\ndelay Tg(ω). Or if the chirp generated over the newly generated spectrum\nis nonlinear this chirp needs to be removed by a correspondingly nonlinear\ngroup delay Tg(ω). Figure 3.13 shows that in the case SPM and positive\nGDD a smoother spectrum with more linear chirp is created and therefore\nthe final compressed pulse is of higher quality, i.e. a higher percentage of the\ntotal pulse energy is really concentrated in the short pulse and not in a large\nuncompressed pulse pedestal.\nFor a beam propagating in a homogenous medium,unfortunately the non\nlinear refractive index does not only lead to a temporal phase modulation but\nalso to a spatial phase modulation, which leads to self-focusing or defocus\ning and small-scale instabilities [43]. Therefore, a fundamental requirement\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nfor pulse compression is that the Kerr effect is provided by a guiding non\nlinear medium so that a spatially uniform spectral broadening is obtained.\nIn 1974 Ippen et al. reported the first measurement of SPM in the absence\nof self-trapping and self-focusing by using a guiding multimode optical fiber\nfilled with liquid CS2 [44]. In 1978 Stolen and Lin reported measurements of\nSPM in single-mode silica core fibers [45]. The important advantage of the\nsingle-mode fiber is that the phase modulation can be imposed over the entire\ntransverse profile of the beam, thus removing the problem of unmodulated\nlight in the wings of the beam [44]. In 1981 Nakatsuka et al. [42] performed\nthe first pulse compression experiment using fibers as a Kerr medium in the\npositive dispersion region.\n3.7.2\nSpectral Broadening with Guided Modes\nThe electric field of a guided mode can be written as [52]:\nE(r, ω) = A(z, ω)F (x, y) exp[iβ(ω)z]\n(3.77)\nwhere A(z, ω) is the mode-amplitude for a given frequency component, F (x, y)\nis the mode-transverse field distribution and β(ω) is the mode-propagation\nconstant. The propagation equation for the guided field splits into two equa\ntions for amplitude A(z, ω) and field pattern F (x, y). In first order pertur\nbation theory a perturbation ∆n = n2|E|2 of the refractive index, which is\nmuch smaller than the index step that defines the mode, does not change the\n\nmodal distribution F (x, y), while the mode propagation constant β(ω) can\n\nbe written as β(ω) = β(ω) + ∆β , where the perturbation ∆β is given by\nR R\n(ω0/c)\n∆n|F (x, y)|2dxdy\n∆β =\nR R\n.\n(3.78)\n|F (x, y)|2dxdy\nAs shown by Eq.(3.78), the perturbation ∆β, which includes the effect due\nto the fiber nonlinearity, is related to a spatial average on the fiber trans\nverse section of the perturbation ∆n. In this way, spatially uniform SPM is\nrealized.\nUsing regular single mode fibers and prism-grating compressors, pulses as\nshort as 6 fs at 620 nm were obtained in 1987 from 50-fs pulses generated by\na colliding-pulse mode-locking dye laser [46] see Figure 3.14. More recently,\n13-fs pulses from a cavity-dumped Ti:sapphire laser were compressed to 4.5\n\nCHAPTER 3.

The use of a single-mode optical fiber limits the pulse\nenergy to a few nanojoule.\nIn 1996, using a phase modulator consisting of a hollow fiber (leaky\nwaveguide) filled with noble gas, a powerful pulse compression technique\nhas been introduced, which handles high-energy pulses [48]. The implemen\ntation of the hollow-fiber compression technique using 20-fs seed pulses from\na Ti:sapphire system and chirped-mirrors that form a dispersive delay line\nhas led to the generation of pulses with duration down to 4.5 fs [49] and en\nergy up to 0.55 mJ [50]. This technique presents the advantages of a guiding\nelement with a large-diameter mode and of a fast nonlinear medium with\nhigh damage threshold.\nThe possibility to take advantage of the ultrabroadband spectrum which\ncan be generated by the phase modulation process, is strictly related to the\ndevelopment of dispersive delay lines capable of controlling the frequency-\ndependent group delay over such bandwidth.\n3.7.3\nDispersion Compensation Techniques\nThe pulse frequency sweep (chirp) imposed by the phase modulation is ap\nproximately linear near the peak of the pulse, where most of the energy is\nconcentrated. In the presence of dispersion in the phase modulator the chirp\nbecomes linear over almost the whole pulse. Therefore, optimum temporal\ncompression requires a group delay, Tg,comp(ω) = ∂φ/∂ω, characterized by a\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nnearly linear dependence on frequency in the dispersive delay line. Since in\nthe case of SPM the nonlinear index n2 is generally positive far from reso\nnance, a negative group delay dispersion (GDD = ∂Tg/∂ω) is required in\nthe compressor. In order to generate the shortest pulses, the pulse group de\nlay after the phase modulator and the compressor must be nearly frequency\nindependent. Tg(ω) can be expanded into a Taylor series around the central\nfrequency ω0:\nφ000\nφ0000\nTg(ω) = φ0(ω0) + φ00(ω0)∆ω +\n(ω0)∆ω2 +\n(ω0)∆ω3 + · · · (3.79)\n3!\n, φ000\nwhere ∆ω = ω - ω0, and φ00(ω0)\n(ω0), and φ0000(ω0) are the second-, the\nthird-, and the fourth-order-dispersion terms, respectively. Critical values of\nthese dispersion terms above which dispersion causes a significant change of\nthe pulse are given by a simple scaling expression: φ(n) = τ n\np , where φ(n) is\nthe nth-order dispersion term and τ p is the pulse duration. For example,\na second order dispersion with φ00 = τ 2\np results in a pulse broadening by\nmore than a factor of two. Therefore dispersion-induced pulse broadening\nand distortion become increasingly important for decreasing pulse durations.\nEquation (3.79) shows that to compress a pulse to near the transform limit\none should eliminate these high order dispersion terms. For instance, assum\ning a transform-limited input pulse to the phase modulator, the condition\nfor third-order-dispersion-compensated compression is the following:\nφ00\nφ00\n(ω0)\n=\nmodulator + φ00\n= 0\n(3.80)\ncompresssor\nφ000\nφ000\n(ω0)\n=\nmodulator + φ000\n= 0\n(3.81)\ncompresssor\nSeveral compressor schemes have been developed so far that included such\ncomponents as: diffraction gratings, Brewster-cut prism pairs, combination\nof gratings and prisms, thin prisms and chirped mirrors, and chirped mirrors\nonly, etc. In the following we will briefly outline the main characteristics of\nthese compressor schemes.\nGrating and Prism Pairs\nIn 1968 Treacy demonstrated for the first time the use of a pair of diffraction\ngratings to achieve negative GDD [55]. In 1984 Fork et al. obtained negative\nGDD with pairs of Brewster-angled prisms [56]. Prism pairs have been widely\nused for dispersion control inside laser oscillators since they can be very low\n\nCHAPTER 3.

In both optical systems the origin of the\nadjustable dispersion is the angular dispersion that arises from diffraction\nand refraction, respectively. The dispersion introduced by these systems can\nbe easily calculated, by calculating the phase accumulated between the input\nand output reference planes [78]. To understand the main properties of these\nsystems, we will refer to Fig. 3.15. The first element scatters the input beam\nwith wave vector kin and input path vector l into the direction kout. The\nbeam passes between the first and the second element and is scattered back\ninto its original direction. The phase difference by the scattered beam and\nthe reference beam without the grating is: φ(ω) = kout(ω) · l. Considering\nfree-space propagation between the two elements, we have |kout| = ω/c, and\nthe accumulated phase can be written as\nω\nω\nD\nφ(ω) = |l| cos[γ - α(ω)] =\ncos[γ - α(ω)]\n(3.82)\nc\nc cos(γ)\nwhere: γ is the angle between the incident wave vector and the normal\nto the first element; α is the angle of the outgoing wave vector, which is\na function of frequency; D is the spacing between the scattering elements\nalong a direction parallel to their normal. In the case of a grating pair the\nfrequency dependence of the diffraction angle α is governed by the grating\n\n3.7.

Using Eq.(3.82) and Eq.(3.83),\nit is possible to obtain analytic expressions for the GDD and the higher-order\ndispersion terms (for single pass):\n4π2cD\nφ00(ω) = -\n(3.84)\nω3d2 cos3 α(ω)\nμ\n¶\nφ000(ω) =\n12π2cD\n2πc sin α(ω)\n1 +\n(3.85)\nω4d2 cos3 α(ω)\nωd cos2 α(ω)\nIt is evident from Eq.(3.84) that grating pairs give negative dispersion. D\nis the distance between the gratings. A disadvantage of the grating pair is\nthe diffraction loss. For a double-pass configuration the loss is typically 75%.\nAlso the bandwidth for efficient diffraction is limited.\nIn the case of a Brewster-angled prism pair Eq.(3.82) reduces to the\nfollowing expression (for single pass) [56]:\nω\nφ(ω) = cp cos β(ω)\n(3.86)\nc\nwhere cp is the distance between prism apices and β(ω) is the angle between\nthe refracted ray at frequency ω and the line joining the two apices.

The prism-compressor has the advantage of reduced losses.\nUsing only fused silica prisms for dispersion compensation, sub-10-fs light\npulses have been generated directly from an oscillator in 1994 [79]. In 1996,\npulses with tens of microjoules energy, spectrally broadened in a gas-filled\nhollow fiber were compressed down to 10 fs using a prism compressor [48].\nBoth in the case of grating and prism pairs, negative GDD is associated with\na significant amount of higher-order dispersion, which cannot be lowered or\nadjusted independently of the desired GDD, thus limiting the bandwidth\nover which correct dispersion control can be obtained. This drawback has\nbeen only partially overcome by combining prism and grating pairs with\nthird-order dispersion of opposite sign. In this way pulses as short as 6 fs\nhave been generated in 1987 [46], and less than 5 fs in 1997 [47], by external\ncompression. This combination cannot be used for few-optical-cycle pulse\ngeneration either in laser oscillators, due to the high diffraction losses of the\ngratings, or in external compressors at high power level, due to the onset of\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nunwanted nonlinearities in the prisms.\n3.7.4\nDispersion Compensating Mirrors\nChirped mirrors are used for the compression of high energy pulses, because\nthey provide high dispersion with little material in the beam path, thus\navoiding nonlinear effects in the compressor.\nGrating and prism compressors suffer from higher order dispersion. In\n1993 Robert Szipoecs and Ferenc Krausz [80] came up with a new idea,\nso called chirped mirrors. Laser mirrors are dielectric mirrors composed of\nalternating high and low index quarter wavelenth thick layers resulting in\nstrong Bragg-reflection. In chirped mirrors the Bragg wavelength is chirped\nso that different wavelength penetrate different depth into the mirror upon\nreflection giving rise to a wavelength dependent group delay. It turns out\nthat the generation of few-cycle pulses via external compression [95] as well\nas direct generation from Kerr lens mode-locked lasers [58] relies heavily on\nthe existence of chirped mirrors [57, 83, 59] for dispersion compensation.\nThere are two reasons to employ chirped mirrors . First the high-reflectivity\nbandwidth, ∆f, of a standard dielectric Bragg-mirror is determined by the\nFresnel reflectivity rB of the high, nH, and low, nL, index materials used for\nthe dielectric mirror\n∆f\nnH - nL\nrB =\n=\n(3.92)\nfc\nnH + nL\nwhere fc is again the center frequency of the mirror. Metal mirrors are\nin general too lossy, especially when used as intracavity laser mirrors. For\nmaterial systems typically used for broadband optical coatings such as Silicon\nDioxide and Titanium Dioxide with nSiO2 = 1.48 and nTiO2 = 2.4, (these\nindexes might vary depending on the deposition technique used), a fractional\nbandwidth ∆f/fc = 0.23 can be covered. This fractional bandwidth is only\nabout a third of an octave spanning mirror ∆f/fc = 2/3. Furthermore, the\nvariation in group delay of a Bragg-mirror impacts already pulses that fill\nhalf the spectral range ∆f = 0.23fc. A way out of this dilemma was found\nby introducing chirped mirrors [57], the equivalent of chirped fiber Bragg\ngratings, which at that time were already well developed components in fiber\noptics [60]. When the Bragg wavelength of the mirror stack is varied slowly\nenough and no limitation on the number of layer pairs exists, an arbitrary\nhigh reflectivity range of the mirror can be engineered. The second reason\nfor using chirped mirrors is based on their dispersive properties due to the\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nwavelength dependent penetration depth of the light reflected from different\npositions inside the chirped multilayer structure. Mirrors are filters, and in\nthe design of any filter, the control of group delay and group delay dispersion\nis difficult. This problem is further increased when the design has to operate\nover wavelength ranges up to an octave or more.\nThe matching problem\nSeveral designs for ultra broadband dispersion\ncompensating mirrors have been developed over the last years. For disper\nsion compensating mirrors which do not extend the high reflectivity range\nfar beyond what a Bragg-mirror employing the same materials can already\nachieve, a multi-cavity filter design can be used to approximate the desired\nphase and amplitude properties [61, 62]. For dispersion compensating mir\nrors covering a high reflectivity range of up to ∆f/fc = 0.4 the concept of\ndouble-chirped mirrors (DCMs) has been developed [83][81]. It is based on\nthe following observations. A simple chirped mirror provides high-reflectivity\nover an arbitrary wavelength range and, within certain limits, a custom des\nignable average group delay via its wavelength dependent penetration depth\n[73] (see Figure 3.17 (a) and (b) ). However, the group delay as a function\nof frequency shows periodic variations due to the impedance mismatch be\ntween the ambient medium and the mirror stack, as well as within the stack\n(see Figure 3.17 b and Figure 3.18). A structure that mitigates these mis\nmatches and gives better control of the group delay dispersion (GDD) is the\ndouble-chirped mirror (DCM) (Figure 3.17 c), in a way similar to that of an\napodized fiber Bragg grating [64].\nFigure 3.18 shows the reflectivity and group delay of several Bragg and\nchirped mirrors composed of 25 index steps, with nH = 2.5 and nL = 1.5,\nsimilar to the refractive indices of TiO2 and SiO2, which result in a Fresnel\nreflectivity of rB = 0.25. The Bragg-mirror can be decomposed in symmetric\nindex steps [83]. The Bragg wavenumber is defined as kB = π/(nLdL +\nnH dH ), where dL and dH are the thicknesses of the low and high index layer,\nrespectively. The Bragg wavenumber describes the center wavenumber of\na Bragg mirror composed of equal index steps. In the first case, (Figure\n3.18, dash-dotted line) only the Bragg wave number is linearly chirped from\n6.8μm-1 < kB < 11μm-1 over the first 20 index steps and held constant over\nthe last 5 index steps.

By adiabatic\nmatching of the grating impedance to the low index material this reflection\ncan be avoided. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3.18 by the dashed and solid\ncurves, corresponding to an additional chirping of the high index layer over\nthe first 12 steps according to the law dH = (m/12)αλB,12/(4nH) with α = 1,\nand 2, for linear and quadratic adiabatic matching.

Because of the\ndouble chirp a high transmission window at the short wavelength end of the\nmirror opens up which is ideally suited for the pumping of Ti:sapphire lasers.\nSo far, the double-chirped mirror is only matched to the low index material\nof the mirror. Ideally, the matching can be extended to any other ambient\nmedium by a properly designed AR-coating. However, this AR-coating has\nto be of very high quality, i.e. very low residual reflectivity ideally a power\n\nCHAPTER 3.

This is achieved in so called tilted front-side\nor back-side coated mirrors [65], [66], (Fig. 3.19 (a) and (b)). In the back\nside coated mirror the ideal DCM structure, which is matched to the low\nindex material of the mirror is deposited on the back of a substrate made\nof the same or at least very similar low index material. The AR-coating is\ndeposited on the front of the slightly wedged substrate, so that the residual\nreflection is directed out of the beam and does not affect the dispersion\nproperties. Thus the task of the AR-coating is only to reduce the Fresnel\nlosses of the mirror at the air-substrate interface, and therefore, it is good\nenough for some applications, if the residual reflection at this interface is of\nthe order of 0.5%. However, the substrate has to be very thin in order to\nkeep the overall mirror dispersion negative, typically on the order of 200-500\nμm. Laser grade quality optics are hard to make on such thin substrates\nand the stress induced by the coating leads to undesired deformation of\nthe substrates. The front-side coated mirror overcomes this shortcoming\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nby depositing the ideal DCM-structure matched to the index of the wedge\nmaterial on a regular laser grade substrate. A 100-200 μm thin wedge is\nbonded on top of the mirror and the AR-coating is then deposited on this\nwedge. This results in stable and octave spanning mirrors, which have been\nsuccessfully used in external compression experiments [69]. Both structures\ncome with limitations. First, they introduce a wedge into the beam, which\nleads to an undesired angular dispersion of the beam. This can partially\nbe compensated by using these mirrors in pairs with oppositely oriented\nwedges. The second drawback is that it seems to be impossible to make high\nquality AR-coatings over one or more than one octave of bandwidth, which\nhave less than 0.5% residual reflectivity [68], i.e. on one reflection such a\nmirror has at least 1% of loss, and, therefore, such mirrors cause high losses\ninside a laser. For external compression these losses are acceptable. A third\npossibility for overcoming the AR-coating problem is given by using the ideal\nDCM under Brewster-angle incidence, (Figure 3.19) [67]. In that case, the\nlow index layer is automatically matched to the ambient air. However, under\np-polarized incidence the index contrast or Fresnel reflectivity of a layer pair\nis reduced and more layer pairs are necessary to achieve high reflectivity.\nAlso the penetration depth into the mirror increased, so that scattering and\nother losses in the layers become more pronounced. On the other hand, such a\nmirror can generate more dispersion per bounce due to the higher penetration\ndepth. For external compression such mirrors might have advantages because\nthey can cover bandwidths much wider than one octave. This concept is\ndifficult to apply to the fabrication of curved mirrors. There is also a spatial\nchirp of the reflected beam, which may become sizeable for large penetration\ndepth and has to be removed by back reflection or an additional bounce on\nanother Brewster-angle mirror, that recombines the beam. For intracavity\nmirrors a way out of this dilemma is found by mirror pairs, which cancel the\nspurious reflections due to an imperfect AR-coating and matching structure\nin the chirped mirror [76]. Also this design has its drawbacks and limitations.\nIt requires a high precision in fabrication and depending on the bandwidth\nof the mirrors it may be only possible to use them for a restricted range of\nangles of incidence.\nDouble-chirped mirror pairs\nThere have been several proposals to increase the bandwidth of laser mirrors\nby mutual compensation of GDD oscillations [70, 71, 72] using computer\n\n3.7.

These early investigations resulted in a rather low reflectivity\nof less than 95% over almost half of the bandwidth considered. The ideas\nleading to the DCMs help us to show analytically that a design of DCM-\npairs covering one octave of bandwidth, i.e. 600 nm to 1200 nm, with high\nreflectivity and improved dispersion characteristics is indeed possible [76].\nUse of these mirror pairs in a Ti:sapphire laser system resulted in 5 fs pulses\nwith octave spanning spectra directly from the laser [58]. Yet, the potential\nof these pairs is by no means fully exploited.\nA DCM-Pair, see Fig. 3.20, consists of a mirror M1 and M2. Each is\ncomposed of an AR-coating and a low-index matched double-chirped back-\nmirror MB with given wavelength dependent penetration depth. The high\nreflectivity range of the back-mirror can be easily extended to one octave by\nsimply chirping slowly enough and using a sufficient number of layer pairs.\n\nCHAPTER 3.

The AR-coating is represented as a two - port with two in\ncoming waves a1, b2 and two outgoing waves a2, b1.

Here, r and t\nare the complex coefficients for reflection and transmission at port 1 assuming\nreflection free termination of port 2. The back-mirror MB, is assumed to be\nperfectly matched to the first layer in the AR-coating, has full reflection over\nthe total bandwidth under consideration. Thus its complex reflectivity in the\nrange of interest is given by\njφb(ω)\nρb = e\n(3.94)\nThe phase φb(ω) is determined by the desired group delay dispersion\nGDDb = -d2φb(ω)/dω2\n(3.95)\nup to an undetermined constant phase and group delay at the center fre\nquency of the mirror, ωc. All higher order derivatives of the phase are\ndetermined by the desired dispersion of the mirror. Analytic formulas for\nthe design of DCMs, showing custom designed dispersion properties without\nconsidering the matching problem to the ambient air, can be found in [73].\n\n3.7.

The phase φt of a\ngood AR-coating, i.e. |r| < 0.1, is linear and, therefore, does not introduce\nundesired oscillations into the GD and GDD. However, the phase φGT I is\nrapidly varying since φb(ω) varies over several 2π over the frequency range\nof interest due to the monotonic group delay of the back-mirror. The size\nof these oscillations scale with the quality of the AR-coating, i.e. with |r|.\nThus, the GDD oscillations are reduced with smaller residual reflectivity of\nthe AR-coating. Assuming, that the reflectivity r is real and smaller or equal\nto 0.1, the oscillations in the group delay and group delay dispersion are easily\nestimated by\ndφGT I\nTg,GT I =\n≈-rTgb(ω) cos[φb(ω)]\n(3.101)\ndω\nwith\nTgb(ω)\n= -dφb(ω)/dω,\nd2φGT I\nGDDGT I =\n(3.102)\n¡dω2\n¢\n≈ r Tgb\n2 (ω) sin[φb(ω)] -GDDb cos[φb(ω)]\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nThe GTI-reflections add up coherently when multiple reflections on chirped\nmirrors occur inside the laser over one round-trip, leading to pre- and post\npulses if the mode-locking mechanism is not strong enough to suppress them\nsufficiently. Experimental results indicate that a residual reflection in the\nAR-coating of r < 0.01 and smaller, depending on the number of reflections\nper round-trip, is required so that the pre- and post pulses are sufficiently\nsuppressed. This corresponds to an AR-coating with less than 10-4 residual\npower reflectivity, which can only be achieved over a very limited range, as\ndiscussed above.\nOver a limited wavelength range of 350 nm centered around 800 nm low\nresidual power reflectivities as small as 10-4 have been achieved effectively\nafter reoptimization of the AR-coating section and the double-chirped section\nto form a combined matching section of higher matching quality. For even\nlarger bandwidth, approaching an octave, a residual power reflectivity of\n10-4 is no longer possible [68]. A way out of this limitation is offered by the\nobservation, that a coherent subtraction of the pre- and post-pulses to first\norder in r is possible by reflections on a mirror pair M1 and M2, see Figure\n3.20 (a) and (b). A series of two reflections on a mirror with reflectivity\n(3.97) and on a similar mirror with an additional phase shift of π between\nthe AR-coating and the back-mirror, having a reflectivity (3.97) where z is\nreplaced by -z, leads to a coherent subtraction of the first order GTI-effects.\nThe resulting total reflectivity of the two reflections is given by the product\nof the individual complex reflectivities assuming the same AR-coating\nμ\n¶2\nt\n1 - z ∗2\ni2φb(ω)\nρtot,2 = -\ne\n(3.103)\nt∗\n1 - z2\nNow, the GTI-effects scale like the power reflectivity of the AR-coating r2\ninstead of the amplitude reflectivity r, which constitutes a tremendous im\nprovement, since it is possible to design AR-coatings to the low index material\nSi02 of the mirror with a residual power reflectivity between 0.001 and 0.01\nwhile covering one octave of bandwidth [68]. However, there does not exist\na single physical layer which generates a phase shift of π/2 during one pas\nsage for all frequency components contained in an octave. Still, a layer with\na quarter wave thickness at the center frequency is a good starting design.\nThen the back-mirror MB in the Mirror M2 can be reoptimized to take care\nof the deviation from a quarter wave thickness further away from the center\nfrequency, because the back-mirror acts as a highly dispersive medium where\nthe phase or group delay can be designed at will.\n\n3.7.

NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nFigure 3.23 shows in the top graph the designed reflectivity of both mir\nrors of the pair in high resolution taking into account the absorption in the\nlayers. The graph below shows the reflectivity of the mirror, which has in ad\ndition high transmission between 510-550 nm for pumping of the Ti:sapphire\ncrystal. Each mirror consists of 40 layer pairs of SiO2 and TiO2 fabricated\nusing ion-beam sputtering [74, 75]. Both mirror reflectivities cover more than\none octave of bandwidth from 580 nm to 1200 nm or 250 to 517 THz, with\nan average reflectivity of about 99.9% including the absorption in the layers.\nIn addition, the mirror dispersion corrects for the second and higher order\ndispersion of all intracavity elements such as the Ti:sapphire crystal and the\nthin, small angle, BaF2 wedges, for fine adjustment of the dispersion from 650\nnm to 1200 nm within the 12 bounces occurring in one roundtrip. The choice\nfor the lower wavelength boundary in dispersion compensation is determined\nand limited by the pump window of Ti:sapphire. The dispersion measure\nment was performed using white light interferometry [77], up to about 1100\nnm because of the silicon detector roll-off. The oscillations in the group delay\nof each mirror are about 10 times larger than those of high quality DCMs\ncovering 350 nm of bandwidth [?]. However, in the average group delay of\nboth mirrors the oscillations are ideally suppressed due to cancellation by\nmore than a factor of ten. Therefore, the effective residual reflectivity of the\nmirror pair covering one octave, r2 , is even smaller than that of conventional\nDCMs.\nMethods for active dispersion compensation\nVarious schemes for active pulse compression have been developed based\non the use of liquid-crystal modulators (LCM), acousto-optic modulators\n(AOM), and mechanically deformable mirrors.\nDispersion compensation using liquid crystal modulators A pulse\nshaping technique [84] based on the use of a LCM for pulse compression offers\nthe advantage of a large bandwidth (300-1500 nm) and in situ adaptive phase\ncontrol, see Figure3.23. In 1997 Yelin et al. [85] demonstrated an adaptive\nmethod for femtosecond pulse compression based on LCM. Strongly chirped\n80-fs pulses generated by an oscillator were sent in a 4-f pulse shaper com\nposed of a pair of thin holographic transmission gratings. A programmable\none-dimensional LCM, placed in the Fourier plane of the shaper, was used\nas an updatable filter for pulse spectral manipulation. Pulses as short as\n\n3.7.

To shape amplitude and phase two pulse shapers with an\namplitude and phase mask each are necessary.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n11 fs (transform-limited duration: 9 fs) have been obtained, employing an\noptimization algorithm for adaptive compression based on a search in the\ntwo-dimensional space of second- and third-order dispersion coefficients. In\n2001, Karasawa et al. [86] demonstrated pulse compression, down to 5 fs, of\nbroadband pulses from an argon-filled hollow fiber, using only a LCM for\nphase compensation. More recently [51], pulses as short as 3.8 fs have been\nachieved through a closed-loop combination of a liquid-crystal spatial light\nmodulator for adaptive pulse compression and spectral-phase interferome\ntry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) [87] measurements as\nfeedback signal.\nOne problem of the method is pixelization in the Fourier plane owing\nto the technology of the liquid-crystal active matrix. Diffraction on pixel\nedges and absorption by the black matrix introduce parasitic effects. The re\nquirement that the actual spectral modulation should approximate a smooth\nfunction despite the fixed, finite size of the individual modulator elements,\nlimits the temporal range over which pulse compression can be achieved [88].\nOther problems are related to the optical damage of the LCM, which limits\nthe maximum pulse energy, and to the high losses introduced by the device.\nVarious nonpixelated devices have been proposed: Dorrer et al. have re\nported on an optically addressed LCM (liquid crystal light valve) [89]. The\nlight valve consists of two continuous transparent electrodes and continuous\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nlayers of a nematic twisted liquid crystal and of photoconductive Bi12SiO20\n(BSO). A local variation of illumination of the BSO layer (in the blue green\nspectral region) induces a change in conductivity. When a voltage is applied\nbetween the two electrodes, the variation of the BSO conductivity results\nin a change in the voltage drop across the liquid crystal layer. As the bire\nfringence of the liquid crystal is voltage dependent, a local variation of the\nrefractive index is created, which translates into a variation of the optical\nphase of the local spectral component. The light valve is addressed by using\na display device. Pixelation effects are avoided because the light valve itself\nis a continuous device. The control of the light valve is more complicated\nthan for the electrically addressed LCM. Moreover, due to its limited spatial\nfrequency response, the spectral resolution is limited.\nDispersion compensation using acousto-optic modulators\nIn 1997 Tournois proposed an acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter\n(AOPDF), to provide large dispersion-compensation ranges[91]. The device\nis based on a collinear acousto-optic interaction in a birefringent uniaxial\ncrystal, see Figure 3.24. The acoustic frequency is a variable function of time\nand provides control over the group delay of the diffracted optical pulse. At\nthe same time, the spectral amplitude of the diffracted pulse is driven by\nthe intensity of the acoustic signal. As demonstrated in Ref. [91], the optical\noutput Eout(t) of the AOPDF is proportional to the convolution of the optical\ninput, Ein(t), and the scaled acoustic signal:\nEout(t) ∝ Ein(t) ⊗ S(t/α)\n(3.104)\nwhere the scaling factor α = ∆n(V/c) is the ratio of the speed of sound\nto the speed of light times the index difference between the ordinary and\nthe extraordinary waves. Therefore, by generating the proper function S(t),\nit is possible to generate any arbitrary convolution with a temporal reso\nlution given by the inverse of the filter bandwidth. Such device have been\nused in kilohertz chirped-pulse amplification laser chains compensating for\ngain narrowing and residual phase errors with the AOPDF, resulting in the\ngeneration of 17-fs transform-limited pulses [92]. The total throughput is 10\n50%, depending on the bandwidth of the device. Devices approaching one\noctave in bandwidth are possible.\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nFigure 3.24: Acousto-optic programable pulse shaper. One element can shape\namplitude and phase of the pulse.\nDispersion compensation using deformable mirrors\nMechanically deformable mirrors can be used for active dispersion control,\nas proposed by Heritage et al. [93]. More recently, pulse compression has\nbeen achieved using an electrostatically deformable, gold-coated, silicon ni\ntride membrane mirror, placed in the Fourier plane of a 4f zero-dispersion\nstretcher [94]. The membrane was suspended over an array of 39 actuator\nelectrodes. The potential applied to each actuator generates an electrostatic\nattraction between the membrane and the electrode, thus inducing a defor\nmation of the mirror surface, which translates into a modulation of the phase\nof the spectral components of the input pulse. The total phase difference is\nφ = 2(2π)∆z/λ, where ∆z is the deflection of the mirror. The minimum\nradius of curvature of the mirror membrane is given by R = T/P, where T\nis the membrane tension and P is the maximum electrostatic pressure. This\nlimitation of the membrane curvature restricts the possibility of the mir\nror correction of higher-order phases. The main advantages of this method\nare the following: the phase modulation is smoothly varying; reduced losses\ndue to the high reflectivity (97%) of the mirror; relatively high actuator den\nsity. Experiments have been performed with a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser,\nwhere the deformable mirror recompressed a 15 fs pulse, previously stretched\nto 90 fs by dispersion in glass, back to approximately the bandwidth limit\n[94].\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nRecently, dispersion control over a bandwidth of ∼ 220 THz has been\ndemonstrated by A. Baltuska et al. [95] using a compressor consisting of\na pair of chirped mirrors and a grating dispersion line with a computer-\ncontrolled flexible mirror positioned in the focal plane. The total throughput\nof the pulse shaper was less than 12% because of the low diffraction efficiency\nof the grating. Using this compressor, the visible-near-IR pulses, generated\nby optical parametric amplification, were compressed to a 4-fs duration.\n3.7.5\nHollow Fiber Compression Technique\nSingle mode fiber only allows compression of low energy pulses. In 1996\nthe group of DeSilvestri in Milan [48] developed a technique that enables\nthe generation of few-cycle light pulses with energies in the millijoule range.\nThe technique is based on propagation of laser pulses in a hollow fiber filled\nwith noble gases (hollow fiber compression technique), see Figure 3.25.The\nmodes of the hollow fiber are leaky modes, i.e. they experience radiation loss.\nHowever, there is one mode, the EH11mode, which has considerably less loss\nthan the higher order modes. This mode is used for pulse compression. The\nnonlinear index in the fiber can be controlled with the gas pressure. Typical\nfiber diameters are 100-500 μm and typical gas pressures are in the range of\n0.1-3bar. As in the case of fiber compression it is important to consider the\noptimization of nonlinear interaction and dispersion. Both the medium and\nwaveguide dispersion has to be taken into account. For more detail see ref.\n[107].\nFigure 3.25: Hollow fiber compression technique [48]\n\n3.8.

Especially, the fundamental soliton, a sech-shaped pulse,\nshows no dispersion which makes them ideal for long distance optical commu\nnication. Due to the universality of the NSE, this dynamics is also extremely\nimportant for modelocked lasers once the pulses become so short that the\n\n3.9. SUMMARY\nspectra experience the dispersion and the peak powers are high enough that\nnonlinear effects become important. In general, this is the case for sub\npicosecond pulses. Further, we found a perturbation theory, which enables\nus to decompose a solution of the NSE close to a fundamental soliton as a\nfundamental soliton and continuum radiation. We showed that periodic per\nturbations of the soliton may lead to side-band generation, if the nonlinear\nphase shift of the soliton within a period of the perturbation becomes com\nparable to π/4. Soliton perturbation theory will also give the frame work for\nstudying noise in mode-locked lasers later.\nA medium with positive dispersion and self-phase modulation with the\nsame sign can be used for pulse compression. The major problem in pulse\ncompression is to find a compressor that can that exactly inverts the group\ndelay caused by spectral broadening. Depending on bandwith this can be\nachieved by grating, prism, chirped mirrors, puls shapers, AOPDFs or a\ncombination thereof.\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\n\nBibliography\n[1] L.

Commun. 56 219-221 (1985)\n\nChapter 4\nLaser Dynamics (single-mode)\nBefore we start to look into the dynamics of a multi-mode laser, we should\nrecall the technically important regimes of operation of a \"single-mode\" laser.\nThe term \"single-mode\" is set in apostrophes, since it doesn't have to be\nreally single-mode. There can be several modes running, for example due to\nspatial holeburning, but in an incoherent fashion, so that only the average\npower of the beam matters. For a more detailed account on single-mode\nlaser dynamics and Q-Switching the following references are recommended\n[1][3][16][4][5].\n4.1\nRate Equations\nIn section 2.5, we derived for the interaction of a two-level atom with a laser\nfield propagating to the right the equations of motion (2.171) and (2.172),\nwhich are given here again:\nμ\n¶\n∂\n1 ∂\nN~\n+\nA(z, t)\n=\n\nw (z, t) A(z, t),\n(4.1)\n∂z\nvg ∂t\n4T2Es\nw - w0\n|A(z, t)|2\nw\n=\n-\n+\nw(z, t)\n(4.2)\nT1\nEs\nwhere T1 is the energy relaxation rate, vg the group velocity in the host\nmaterial where the two level atoms are embedded, Es = IsT1, the saturation\nfluence [J/cm2] , of the medium.and Is the saturation intensity according to\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Vg is the volume of\nthe active gain medium. For a laser cavity with a semi-transparent mirror\nwith transmission T , producing a small power loss 2l = - ln(1 - T ) ≈ T (for\nsmall T ) per round-trip in the cavity, the cavity decay time is τ p = 2l/TR ,\nif TR = 2∗L/c0 is the roundtrip-time in linear cavity with optical length 2L\nor a ring cavity with optical length L. The optical length L is the sum of the\ngroup\noptical length in the gain medium ng\nlg and the remaining free space cavity\nlength la. Internal losses can be treated in a similar way and contribute to\nthe cavity decay time. Note, the decay rate for the inversion in the absence\nof a field, 1/T1, is not only due to spontaneous emission, but is also a result of\nnon radiative decay processes. See for example the four level system shown\nin Fig. 4.2.

This can be\ndone actively, for example by quickly moving one of the resonator mirrors in\nplace or passively by placing a saturable absorber in the resonator [1, 16].\nHellwarth was first to suggest this method only one year after the invention of\n\n4.4.

As a rough orientation for a solid-state laser, the following relation\nfor the relevant time scales is generally valid\nτ L A TR A τ p.\n(4.32)\n4.4.1\nActive Q-Switching\nFig. 4.5 shows the principle dynamics of an actively Q-switched laser. The\nlaser is pumped by a pump pulse with a length on the order of the upper-\nstate lifetime, while the intracavity losses are kept high enough, so that\nthe laser can not reach threshold. Therefore, the laser medium acts as an\nenergy storage. The energy only relaxes by spontenous and nonradiative\ntransitions. Then suddenly the intracavity loss is reduced, for example by\na rotating cavity mirror. The laser is pumped way above threshold and the\nlight field builts up exponentially with the net gain until the pulse energy\ncomes close to the saturation energy of the gain medium. The gain saturates\nand is extracted, so that the laser is shut off by the pulse itself.\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nA typical actively Q-switched pulse is asymmetric: The rise time is pro\nportional to the net gain after the Q-value of the cavity is actively switched\nto a high value. The light intensity growths proportional to 2g0/TR. When\nthe gain is depleted, the fall time mostly depends on the cavity decay time\nτ p. For short Q-switched pulses a short cavity length, high gain and a large\nchange in the cavity Q is necessary. If the Q-switch is not fast, the pulse\nwidth may be limited by the speed of the switch. Typical electro-optical and\nacousto-optical switches are 10 ns and 50 ns, respectively\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nKeller, U., Ultrafast Laser Physics, Institute of Quantum Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,\nETH Honggerberg--HPT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.\nFigure 4.6: Asymmetric actively Q-switched pulse.\nFor example, with a diode-pumped Nd:YAG microchip laser [6] using an\nelectro-optical switch based on LiT aO3 Q-switched pulses as short as 270 ps\nat repetition rates of 5 kHz, peak powers of 25 kW at an average power of\n34 mW, and pulse energy of 6.8 μJ have been generated (Figure 4.7).\n\n4.4.

LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\n4.4.2\nSingle-Frequency Q-Switched Pulses\nQ-switched lasers only deliver stable output if they oscillate single frequency.\nUsually this is not automatically achieved. One method to achieve this is by\nseeding with a single-frequency laser during Q-switched operation, so that\nthere is already a population in one of the longitudinal modes before the\npulse is building up. This mode will extract all the energy before the other\nmodes can do, see Figure 4.9\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nKeller, U., Ultrafast Laser Physics, Institute of Quantum Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,\nETH Honggerberg--HPT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.\nFigure 4.9: Output intenisity of a Q-switched laser without a) and with\nseeding b).\nAnother possibility to achieve single-mode output is either using an etalon\nin the cavity or making the cavity so short, that only one longitudinal mode\nis within the gain bandwidth (Figure 4.10). This is usually only the case if\nthe cavity length is on the order of a view millimeters or below.The microchip\nlaser [6][11][10] can be combined with an electro-optic modulator to achieve\n\n4.4.

LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\n4.4.3\nTheory of Active Q-Switching\nWe want to get some insight into the pulse built-up and decay of the actively\nQ-switched pulse. We consider the ideal situation, where the loss of the laser\ncavity can be instantaneously switched from a high value to a low value, i.e.\nthe quality factor is switched from a low value to a high value, respectively\n(Figure: 4.11)\nPumping Interval\nCavity Loss\nQ-switch\nt\nLaser output\npulse\ng(t) ∝ N(t)\nI ∝ Nth(t)\nnL(t) ∝ P(t)\nNf\nNi\nPulse Output\nInterval\nFigure 4.11:\nAcitve Q-Switching dynamics assuming an instantaneous\nswitching [16].\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nPumping Interval:\nDuring pumping with a constant pump rate Rp, proportional to the small\nsignal gain g0, the inversion is built up.

We further assume\nthat during pulse built-up the stimulated emission rate is the dominate term\nchanging the inversion.

Note, r means how many times the laser\nis pumped above threshold after the Q-switch is operated and the intracavity\nlosses have been reduced to l.

Without the saturable\nabsorber these oscillations are damped. If for some reason there is two much\ngain in the system, the light field can build up quickly. Especially for a low\ngain cross section the backaction of the growing laser field on the inversion is\nweak and it can grow further. This growth is favored in the presence of loss\nthat saturates with the intensity of the light. The laser becomes unstabile,\nthe field intensity growth as long as the gain does not saturate below the net\nloss, see Fig.4.15.\n\n4.4.

Neglecting standing wave effects in the\ncavity, the field density is related to twice the circulating power P + or P - .\nRate equations for a passively Q-switched laser\nWe make the following assumptions: First, the transverse relaxation times\nof the equivalent two level models for the laser gain medium and for the\nsaturable absorber are much faster than any other dynamics in our system,\nso that we can use rate equations to describe the laser dynamics. Second, we\nassume that the changes in the laser intensity, gain and saturable absorption\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nare small on a time scale on the order of the round-trip time TR in the cavity,\n(i.e. less than 20%). Then, we can use the rate equations of the laser as\nderived above plus a corresponding equation for the saturable loss q similar\nto the equation for the gain.\nTR\ndP\n=\n2(g - l - q)P\n(4.49)\ndt\ndg\ng - g0\ngTRP\nTR\n= -\n-\n(4.50)\ndt\nTL\nEL\ndq\nq - q0\nqTRP\nTR\n= -\n-\n(4.51)\ndt\nTA\nEA\nwhere P denotes the laser power, g the amplitude gain per roundtrip, l the\nlinear amplitude losses per roundtrip, g0 the small signal gain per roundtrip\nand q0 the unsaturated but saturable losses per roundtrip. The quanti\nties TL = τ L/TR and TA = τ A/TR are the normalized upper-state life\ntime of the gain medium and the absorber recovery time, normalized to\nthe round-trip time of the cavity. The energies EL = hνAeff,L/2∗σL and\nEA = hνAeff,A/2∗σA are the saturation energies of the gain and the ab\nsorber, respectively. .\nFor solid state lasers with gain relaxation times on the order of τ L ≈ 100\nμs or more, and cavity round-trip times TR ≈ 10 ns, we obtain TL ≈ 104 .\nFurthermore, we assume absorbers with recovery times much shorter than\nthe round-trip time of the cavity, i.e. τ A ≈ 1 - 100 ps, so that typically\nTA ≈ 10-4 to 10-2 . This is achievable in semiconductors and can be en\ngineered at will by low temperature growth of the semiconductor material\n[20, 30]. As long as the laser is running cw and single mode, the absorber will\nfollow the instantaneous laser power. Then, the saturable absorption can be\nadiabatically eliminated, by using eq.(4.51)\nq0\nEA\nq =\nwith PA =\n,\n(4.52)\n1 + P/PA\nτ A\nand back substitution into eq.(4.49). Here, PA is the saturation power of\nthe absorber. At a certain amount of saturable absorption, the relaxation\noscillations become unstable and Q-switching occurs.

Inequality (4.57) has a simple physical explanation. The right hand\nside of (4.57) is the relaxation time of the gain towards equilibrium, at a\ngiven pump power and constant laser power. The left hand side is the decay\ntime of a power fluctuation of the laser at fixed gain. If the gain can not\nreact fast enough to fluctuations of the laser power, relaxation oscillations\ngrow and result in passive Q-switching of the laser.\nAs can be seen from Eq.(4.55) and Eq.(4.57), we obtain\n\n< rs\n\nP\nχPL\ndq\nPA\n-2TLP\n= 2TLq0 3\nwith χ =\n,\n(4.60)\ndP\nPL\ncw\nP\n1 + χPL\ncw\nwhere χ is an effective \"stiffness\" of the absorber against cw saturation.

As can be\ninferred from Fig. 4.18 and eq.(4.60), the laser can never Q-switch, i.e. the\nleft side of eq.(4.60) is always smaller than the right side, if the quantity\n2q0TL\nMDF =\n< 1\n(4.61)\nχ\nis less than 1. The abbreviation MDF stands for mode locking driving force,\ndespite the fact that the expression (4.61) governs the Q-switching instabil\nity.

For solid-state lasers with long upper state life times, already\nvery small amounts of saturable absorption, even a fraction of a percent,\nmay lead to a large enough mode locking driving force to drive the laser into\nQ-switching.

EXAMPLE: SINGLE MODE CW-Q-SWITCHED MICROCHIP LASERS155\n4.5\nExample: Single Mode CW-Q-Switched\nMicrochip Lasers\nQ-switched microchip lasers are compact and simple solid-state lasers, which\ncan provide a high peak power with a diffraction limited output beam. Due to\nthe extremely short cavity length, typically less than 1 mm, single-frequency\nQ-switched operation with pulse widths well below a ns can be achieved.\nPulse durations of 337 ps and 218 ps have been demonstrated with a passively\nQ-switched microchip laser consisting of a Nd:YAG crystal bonded to a thin\npiece of Cr4+:YAG [8, 9]. Semiconductor saturable absorbers were used to\npassively Q-switch a monolithic Nd:YAG laser producing 100 ns pulses [38].\n4.5.1\nSet-up of the Passively Q-Switched Microchip\nLaser\nFigure 4.23(a) shows the experimental set-up of the passively Q-switched\nmicrochip laser and Fig. 4.23(b) the structure of the semiconductor sat\nurable absorber [12, 13]. The saturable absorber structure is a so called\nanti-resonant Fabry-Perot saturable absorber (A-FPSA), because in a mi\ncrochip laser the beam size is fixed by the thermal lens that builds up in\nthe laser crystal, when pumped with the diode laser. Thus, one can use the\ntop reflector of the A-FPSA to scale the effective saturation intensity of the\nabsorber with respect to the intracavity power. The 200 or 220 μm thick\nNd:YVO4 or Nd:LaSc3(BO3)4, (Nd:LSB) laser crystal [39] is sandwiched be\ntween a 10% output coupler and the A-FPSA. The latter is coated for high\nreflection at the pump wavelength of 808 nm and a predesigned reflectivity\nat the laser wavelength of 1.062 μ m, respectively. The laser crystals are\npumped by a semiconductor diode laser at 808 nm through a dichroic beam-\nsplitter, that transmits the pump light and reflects the output beam at 1.064\nμm for the Nd:YVO4 or 1.062 μm for the Nd:LSB laser. To obtain short Q-\nswitched pulses, the cavity has to be as short as possible. The highly doped\nlaser crystals with a short absorption length of only about 100μm lead to a\nshort but still efficient microchip laser [13]. The saturable absorber consists\nof a dielectric top mirror and 18 pairs of GaAs/InGaAs MQW's grown on a\nGaAs/AlAs Bragg-mirror. The total optical thickness of the absorber is on\nthe order of 1 μm. Therefore, the increase of the cavity length due to the\n\nCHAPTER 4.

For more details see [12, 13]. Pulses as short as 56 ps,\nFig. (4.24), have been achieved with Nd:LSB-crystals.\n4.5.2\nDynamics of a Q-Switched Microchip Laser\nThe passively Q-switched microchip laser, shown in Fig. 4.23(a), is perfectly\nmodelled by the rate equations (4.49) to (4.51). To understand the basic\ndependence of the cw-Q-switching dynamics on the absorber parameters, we\nperformed numerical simulations of the Nd:LSB microchip laser, as shown\nin Fig. 4.23. The parameter set used, is given in Table 4.2. For these pa\nrameters, we obtain according to eq.(4.55) a mode locking driving force of\nMDF = 685. This laser operates clearly in the cw-Q-switching regime as\nsoon as the laser is pumped above threshold. Note, the Q-switching condi\ntion (4.61) has only limited validity for the microchip laser considered here,\nbecause, the cavity length is much shorter than the absorber recovery time.\nThus the adiabatic elimination of the absorber dynamics is actually not any\nlonger justified. Figures 4.25 and 4.26 show the numerical solution of the set\nof rate equations (4.49) to (4.51) on a microsecond timescale and a picosecond\ntimescale close to one of the pulse emission events.\nNo analytic solution to the set of rate equations is known. Therefore,\noptimization of Q-switched lasers has a long history [4, 5], which in general\nresults in complex design criteria [5], if the most general solution to the rate\n\nPower, kW\nGain, Loss\nCHAPTER 4.

However, a careful look at the simulation results\nleads to a set of very simple design criteria, as we show in the following.\nAs seen from Fig. 4.25, the pulse repetition time Trep is many orders of\nmagnitude longer than the width of a Q-switched pulse. Thus, between two\npulse emissions, the gain increases due to pumping until the laser reaches\nthreshold. This is described by eq.(4.50), where the stimulated emission\nterm can be neglected. Therfore, the pulse repetition rate is determined by\nthe relation that the gain has to be pumped to threshold again gth = l + q0,\nif it is saturated to the value gf after pulse emission. In good approximation,\ngf = l - q0, as long as it is a positive quantity. If Trep < τ L, one can linearize\nthe exponential and we obtain\ngth - gf = g0\nTrep\n(4.68)\nτ L\ngth - gf\n2q0\nTrep = τ L\n= τ L\n.\n(4.69)\ng0\ng0\nFigure 4.26 shows, that the power increases, because, the absorber saturates\nfaster than the gain. To obtain a fast raise of the pulse, we assume an\nabsorber which saturates much easier than the gain, i.e. EA ¿ EL, and the\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nrecovery times of gain and absorption shall be much longer than the pulse\nwidth τ pulse, τ A A τ pulse. Since, we assume a slow gain and a slow absorber,\nwe can neglect the relaxation terms in eqs.(4.50) and (4.51) during growth\nand decay of the pulse. Then the equations for gain and loss as a function\nof the unknown Q-switched pulse shape fQ(t)\nP (t) = EP fQ(t)\n(4.70)\ncan be solved. The pulse shape fQ(t) is again normalized, such that its\nintegral over time is one and EP is, therefore, the pulse energy. Analogous to\nthe derivation for the Q-switched mode locking threshold in eqs.(4.84) and\n(4.85), we obtain\n∙\nZ\n\nEP\nt\nq(t)\n=\nq0 exp -\nfQ(t0)dt0 ,\n(4.71)\n∙ EA Z\n-inf\n\nEP\nt\ng(t)\n=\ngth exp -\nfQ(t0)dt0 .\n(4.72)\nEL\n-inf\nSubstitution of these expressions into the eq.(4.49) for the laser power, and\nintegration over the pulse width, determines the extracted pulse energy.

Also approximate solutions for small and large s are shown\nas the dashed curves. Thus, the larger the ratio between saturable and\nnonsaturable losses is, the larger is the intracavity pulse energy, which is not\n\nNormalized Pulse Energy, E\n/ E\n4.5.

For a given amount of saturable absorption,\nthe extracted pulse energy is maximum for an output coupling as large as\npossible. Of course threshold must still be reached, i.e. l + q0 < g0. Thus,\nin the following, we assume l > q0 as in Fig. 4.26. The absorber is immedi\natelly bleached, after the laser reaches threshold. The light field growth and\nextracts some energy stored in the gain medium, until the gain is saturated\nto the low loss value l. Then the light field decays again, because the gain\nis below the loss. During decay the field can saturate the gain by a similar\namount as during build-up, as long as the saturable losses are smaller than\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nthe constant output coupler losses l, which we shall assume in the following.\nThen the pulse shape is almost symmetric as can be seen from Fig. 4.26(b)\nand is well approximated by a secant hyperbolicus square for reasons that\nwill become obvious in a moment.

If we expand this equation up\nto first order in EP /EL and compare coefficients, we find from the constant\nterm the energy (4.77), and from the tanh-term we obtain the following\nsimple expression for the pulse width\nTR\nτ P = 2\n.\n(4.80)\nq0\nFor the FWHM pulse width of the resulting sech2-pulse we obtain\nTR\nτ P,F W HM = 3.5\n.\n(4.81)\nq0\nThus, for optimium operation of a Q-switched microchip laser, with respect\nto minimum pulse width and maximum extracted energy in the limits consid\nered here, we obtain a very simple design criterium. If we have a maximum\nsmall signal round-trip gain g0, we should design an absorber with q0 some\nwhat smaller than g0/2 and an output coupler with q0 < l < g0 - q0, so that\nthe laser still fullfills the cw-Q-switching condition. It is this simple opti\nmization, that allowed us to reach the shortest pulses every generated from a\ncw-Q-switched solid-state laser. Note, for a maximum saturable absorption\nof 2 q0 = 13%, a cavity roundtip time of TR = 2.6 ps for the Nd:YVO4 laser,\none expects from (4.81) a pulse width of about τ P = 70ps, which is close to\nwhat we observed in the experiment above. We achieved pulses between 56\nand 90 ps [13]. The typical extracted pulse energies were on the order of EP\n= 0.1 - 0.2 μJ for pulses of about 60ps [13].

Thus, we\nhave a deviation of one order of magnitude, which clearly indicates that the\nabsorber still introduces too much of nonsaturable intracavity losses. Low\nering of these losses should lead to μJ - 50 ps pulses from this type of a\nvery simple and cheap laser, when compared with any other pulse generation\ntechnique.\n4.6\nQ-Switched Mode Locking\nTo understand the regime of Q-switched mode locking, we reconsider the rate\nequations (4.49) to (4.51). Fig. 4.28 shows, that we can describe the laser\npower on two time scales. One is on the order of the Q-switching envelope\nand occurs on multiple round-trips in the laser cavity, T = mTR. Therefore,\nit is on the order of microseconds. The other time scale t is a short time scale\non the order of the pulse width, i.e. picoseconds. Assuming a normalized\npulse shape fn(t) for the n-th pulse such that\nZ TR/2\nfn(t - nTR)dt = 1,\n(4.82)\n-TR/2\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nwe can make the following ansatz for the laser power\ninf\nX\nP (T, t) = EP (T )\nfn(t - nTR).\n(4.83)\nn=-inf\nHere, EP (T = mTR) is the pulse energy of the m-th pulse, which only changes\nappreciably over many round-trips in the cavity. The shape of the m-th pulse,\nfm(t), is not yet of further interest. For simplicity, we assume that the mode-\nlocked pulses are much shorter than the recovery time of the absorber. In this\ncase, the relaxation term of the absorber in Eq.(4.52) can be neglected during\nthe duration of the mode-locked pulses. Since the absorber recovery time is\nassumed to be much shorter than the cavity round-trip time, the absorber\nis unsaturated before the arrival of a pulse. Thus, for the saturation of the\nabsorber during one pulse, we obtain\n∙\nZ\n\nEP (T )\nt\nq(T = mTR, t) = q0 exp -\nfm(t0)dt0 .\n(4.84)\nEA\n-TR/2\nThen, the loss in pulse energy per roundtrip can be written as\nh\ni\n-EP (T )\nZ TR/2\n1 - exp\nqP (T ) =\nfm(t)q(T = mTR, t)dt = q0\nEA\n.\n(4.85)\nEP (T )\n-TR/2\nEA\nEq. (4.85) shows that the saturable absorber saturates with the pulse energy\nand not with the average intensity of the laser, as in the case of cw-Q\nswitching (4.52). Therefore, the absorber is much more strongly bleached\nat the same average power. After averaging Eqs.(4.49) and (4.50) over one\nround-trip, we obtain the following two equations for the dynamics of the\npulse energy and the gain on a coarse grained time scale T :\ndEP\nTR\n=\n2(g - l - qP (EP ))EP ,\n(4.86)\ndT\ndg\ng - g0\ngEP\nTR\n= -\n-\n.\n(4.87)\ndT\nTL\nEL\nThis averaging is allowed, because the saturation of the gain medium within\none pulse is negligible, due to the small interaction cross section of the\nsolid-state laser material. Comparing Eqs.(4.49), (4.50) and (4.52) with\n(4.84), (4.86) and (4.87), it becomes obvious that the stability criterion (4.53)\n\n4.6. Q-SWITCHED MODE LOCKING\nalso applies to Q-switched mode locking if we replace the formula for cw-\nsaturation of the absorber (4.52) by the formula for pulsed saturation (4.85).\nThen, stability against Q-switched mode locking requires\ndqP\n\n< r\n-2EP\n(4.88)\n,\ndEP\nTL\ncw-mod\ncw-mod\nwith\nh\ni 3\n\ndqP\n\n1 - exp -EP\n1 + EP\nEA\nEA\n-2EP\n= 2q0\nEP\n.\n(4.89)\nEA\ndEP cw-mod\nWhen expressed in terms of the average power P = EP /TR, similar to\nEq.(4.60), we obtain\nh\ni 3\n\ndqP\n\n1 - exp - P\n1 + P\nχP PL\nP\nχP PL\n-2TLEP\n= 2TLq0\n,\n(4.90)\ndEP cw-mod\nχP PL\nwhere χP = χTA describes an effective stiffness of the absorber compared\nwith the gain when the laser is cw-mode-locked at the same average power\nas the cw laser. Thus, similar to the case of cw-Q-switching and mode locking\nit is useful to introduce the driving force for Q-switched mode locking\n2q0TL\nQMDF =\n.\n(4.91)\nχP\nFigure 4.29 shows the relation (4.88) for different absorber strength. In\ngoing from Fig. 4.18 to Fig. 4.29, we used TA = 0.1. We see, that the\nshort normalized recovery time essentially leads to a scaling of the abscissa,\nwhen going from Fig. 4.18 to Fig. 4.29 while keeping all other parameters\nconstant. Comparing Eqs.(4.61) with (4.91), it follows that, in the case of\ncw-mode locking, the absorber is more strongly saturated by a factor of\n1/TA, which can easily be as large as 1000. Therefore, the Q-switched mode\nlocking driving force is much larger than the mode locking driving force,\nMDF, Accordingly, the tendency for Q-switched mode locking is significantly\nhigher than for cw Q-switching. However, now, it is much easier to saturate\nthe absorber with an average power well below the damage threshold of the\nabsorber (Fig. 4.29). Therefore, one is able to leave the regime of Q-switched\nmode locking at a large enough intracavity power.\n\nCHAPTER 4.

SUMMARY\nWe summarize our results for Q-switched mode locking in Fig. 4.30.\nIt shows the stability boundary for Q-switched mode locking according to\neq.(4.88), for different strengths of the saturable absorber, i.e. different values\n2q0TL. One may also derive minimum critical mode locking driving force for\nself-starting modelocking of the laser MDFc due to various processes in the\nlaser [24][25][27][28]. Or, with the definition of the pulsed stiffness, we obtain\n2q0TL\nχp,c ≤\nTA.\n(4.92)\nMDFc\nThus, for a self-starting laser which shows pure cw-mode locking, we have to\ndesign the absorber such that its MDF is greater than this critical value. Or\nexpressed differently, the pulsed stiffness has to be smaller than the critical\nvalue χp,c, at a fixed value for the absorber strength q0. There is always\na trade-off: On one hand, the mode locking driving force has to be large\nenough for self-starting. On the other hand the saturable absorption has to\nbe small enough, so that the laser can be operated in a parameter regime\nwhere it is stable against Q-switching mode locking, see Fig. (4.30).\n4.7\nSummary\nStarting from a simple two level laser and absorber model, we characterized\nthe dynamics of solid-state lasers mode-locked and Q-switched by a saturable\nabsorber. The unique properties of solid-state laser materials, i.e. their long\nupper-state life time and their small cross sections for stimulated emission,\nallow for a separation of the laser dynamics on at least two time scales.\nOne process is the energy build-up and decay, which occurs typically on a\ntime scale of the upper state lifetime or cavity decay time of the laser. The\nother process is the pulse shaping, which occurs within several roundtrips\nin the cavity. Separating these processes, we can distinguish between the\ndifferent laser dynamics called cw-Q-switching, Q-switched mode locking and\ncw-mode locking. We found the stability boundaries of the different regimes,\nwhich give us guidelines for the design of absorbers for a given solid state\nlaser to favour one of these regimes. Semiconductor absorbers are a good\nchoice for saturable absorbers to modelock lasers, since the carrier lifetime\ncan be engineered by low temperature growth [20]. When the pulses become\nshort enough, the laser pulse saturates the absorber much more efficiently,\nwhich stabilizes the laser against undesired Q-switched mode locking. It has\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nbeen demonstrated experimentally, that this technique can control the laser\ndynamics of a large variety of solid-state lasers, such as Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF,\nNd:YV04, [18] in the picosecond regime.\nWith semiconductor devices and soliton formation due to negative GVD\nand SPM, we can use similar semiconductor absorbers to modelock the lasers\nin the femtosecond regime [35]. The stability criteria derived here can be ap\nplied to both picosecond and femtosecond lasers. However, the characteristics\nof the absorber dynamics may change drastically when going from picosecond\nto femtosecond pulses [36]. Especially, the saturation energy may depend not\nonly on excitation wavelength, but also on the pulsewidth. In addition there\nmay be additional loss mechanismes for the pulse, for example due to soliton\nformation there are additional filter losses of the pulse which couple to the\nenergy of the pulse via the area theorem. This has to be taken into account,\nbefore applying the theory to fs-laser systems, which will be discussed in\nmore detail later.\n\nBibliography\n[1] R. W.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\n5.1\nThe Master Equation of Mode Locking\nLets consider for the moment the cold cavity (i.e. there is only a simple\nlinear medium in the cavity no lasing). The most general solution for the\nintracavity field is a superpositon of left- and rightward running waves\ninf\nX\n(\n)\nj(Ωnt+Knz)\nE(left)(z, t) = Re\nEˆ ne\n,\n(5.1)\nn=0\nand\n(\n)\ninf\nE(right)(z, t) = Re\nj(Ωnt-Knz)\nX\nEˆ ne\n.\n(5.2)\nn=0\nThe possible values for the wavenumbers are Kn = nπ/L, resulting from the\nboundary conditions on metallic mirrors or periodicity after one roundtrip in\nthe cavity. If the mirrors are perfectly reflecting, the leftward and rightward\nmoving waves Eqs.(5.1) and (5.2) contain the same information and it is\nsufficient to treat only one of them. Usually one of the cavity mirrors is\nnot perfectly reflecting in order to couple out light, however, this can be\nconsidered a perturbation to the ideal mode structure.\nWe consider the modes in Eq.(5.2) as a continuum and replace the sum\nby an integral\n1⁄2Z inf\nE(right)(z, t) = 1\nˆ\nj(Ω(K)t-Kz)dK\nE(K)\n3⁄4\nRe\n(5.3)\ne\n2π\nK=0\nwith\nEˆ(Km) = Eˆ m2L.\n(5.4)\nEq.(5.3) is similar to the pulse propagation discussed in chapter 2 and de\nscribes the pulse propagation in the resonator. However, here it is rather\nan initial value problem, rather than a boundary value problem. Note, the\nwavenumbers of the modes are fixed, not the frequencies. To emphasize this\neven more, we introduce a new time variable T = t and a local time frame\nt0 = t - z/υg,0, instead of the propagation distance z, where υg,0 is the group\nvelocity at the central wave number Kn0 of the pulse\n¶-1\n.\nυg,0 = ∂ω\n=\nμ∂k\n∂k\n∂ω\nk=0\n(5.5)\nω=0\n\n5.1. THE MASTER EQUATION OF MODE LOCKING\nFor introduction of a slowly varying envelope, we shift the frequency and\nwavenumber by the center frequency ω0 = Ωn0 and center wave number\nk0 = Kn0\nk = K - Kn0 ,\n(5.6)\nω(k)\n=\nΩ(Kn0 + k) - Ωn0 ,\n(5.7)\nEˆ(k)\n=\nEˆ(Kn0 + k),\n(5.8)\nThe temporal evolution of the pulse is than determined by\n(Z inf\nˆ\nj(ω(k)t-kz)dk\nE(k)e\n)\nE(right)(z, t) =\nej(ω0t-k0z).\n(5.9)\nRe\n2π\n-Kn0 →-inf\nAnalogous to chapter 2, we define a slowly varying field envelope, that is\nalready normalized to the total power flow in the beam\nZ inf\nAeff 1\nEˆ(k)ej(ω(k)t-kz)dk.\n(5.10)\nr\nA(z, t) =\n2π\n2Z0\n-inf\nWith the retarded time t0 and time T, we obtain analogous to Eq.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nSofar, only the lossless resonator is treated. The gain and loss can be mod\nelled by adding a term like\n∂A(T, t0)\n= -lA(T, t0)\n(5.15)\nTR\n∂T\n(loss)\nwhere l is the amplitude loss per round-trip. In an analogous manner we can\nwrite for the gain\n∂A(T, t0)\n¶\nμ\n∂2\nA(T, t0),\n(5.16)\nTR\n= g(T) + Dg ∂t02\n∂T\n(gain)\nwhere g(T) is the gain and and Dg is the curvature of the gain at the maxi-\ng\nmum of the Lorentzian lineshape.\nDg = g(T)\nΩ2\n(5.17)\nDg is the gain dispersion. g(T) is an average gain, which can be computed\nfrom the rate equation valid for each unit cell in the resonator. The dis\ntributed gain obeys the equation\n∂g(z, t)\ng - g0\n|A(z, t)|2\n= -\n- g\n,\n(5.18)\n∂t\nτ L\nEL\nwhere EL is the saturation energy EL = 2\nhν\n∗σ\nL\nL Aeff , τ L the upper state lifetime\nand σL the gain cross section. For typical solid-state lasers, the intracavity\npulse energy is much smaller than the saturation energy. Therefore, the gain\nchanges within one roundtrip are small. Furthermore, we assume that the\ngain saturates spatially homogeneous, g(z, t0) = g(t0). Then, the equation for\nthe average gain g(T) can be found by averageing (5.18) over one round-trip\nand we obtain\n∂g(T)\ng - g0\nW(T)\n= -\n- g\n,\n(5.19)\n∂T\nτ L\nELTR\nwhere W(T) is the intracavity pulse energy at time t = T\nZ TR/2\nZ inf\nW(T) =\n|A(T, t0)|2dt0 ≈\n|A(T, t0)|2dt0 .\n(5.20)\nt0=-TR/2\n-inf\n\n5.2. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING BY LOSS MODULATION\nFigure 5.2:\nActively modelocked laser with an amplitude modulator\n(Acousto-Optic-Modulator).\nTaking all effects into account, the linear ones: loss, dispersion, gain and\ngain dispersion, as well as the nonlinear ones like saturable absorption and\nself-phase modulation, we end up with the master equation of modelocking\ninf\nμ\n¶\nX\n∂n\n∂A(T, t0)\nn\nTR\n= -lA(T, t0) + j\nDn j\nA(T, t0)\n∂T\n∂t\nn=2 ¶\nμ\n1 ∂2\n+ g(T) 1 +\nA(T, t0)\n(5.21)\nΩ2 g ∂t02\n- q(T, t0)A(T, t0) - jδ|A(T, t0)|2A(T, t0).\nTo keep notation simple, we replace t0 by t again. This equation was first\nderived by Haus [4] under the assumption of small changes in pulse shape\nper round-trip and per element passed within one round-trip.\n5.2\nActive Mode Locking by Loss Modula\ntion\nActive mode locking was first investigated in 1970 by Kuizenga and Siegman\nusing a gaussian pulse analyses, which we want to delegate to the exercises\n[3]. Later in 1975 Haus [4] introduced the master equation approach (5.21).\nWe follow the approach of Haus, because it also shows the stability of the\nsolution.\nWe introduce a loss modulator into the cavity, for example an acousto\noptic modulator, which periodically varias the intracavity loss according to\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nKeller, U., Ultrafast Laser Physics, Institute of Quantum Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,\nETH Honggerberg--HPT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.\nFigure 5.3: Schematic representation of the master equation for an actively\nmode-locked laser.\nq(t) = M (1 - cos(ωM t)). The modulation frequency has to be very precisely\ntuned to the resonator round-trip time, ωM = 2π/TR, see Fig.5.2. The\nmodelocking process is then described by the master equation\n∙\n\n∂A\n∂2\nTR\n= g(T) + Dg\n- l - M (1 - cos(ωM t)) A.\n(5.22)\n∂T\n∂t2\nneglecting GDD and SPM. The equation can be interpreted as the total pulse\nshaping due to gain, loss and modulator, see Fig.5.3.\nIf we fix the gain in Eq. (5.22) at its stationary value, what ever it might\nbe, Eq.(5.22) is a linear p.d.e, which can be solved by separation of variables.\nThe pulses, we expect, will have a width much shorter than the round-trip\ntime TR. They will be located in the minimum of the loss modulation where\nthe cosine-function can be approximated by a parabola and we obtain\n∙\n\n∂A\n∂2\nTR\n= g - l + Dg\n- Mst2 A.\n(5.23)\n∂T\n∂t2\nMs is the modulation strength, and corresponds to the curvature of the loss\nmodulation in the time domain at the minimum loss point\nDg =\ng ,\n(5.24)\nΩ2 g\nMω2\nMs =\nM .\n(5.25)\n\n5.2. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING BY LOSS MODULATION\nThe differential operator on the right side of (5.23) corresponds to the Schrodinger-\nOperator of the harmonic oscillator problem. Therefore, the eigen functions\nof this operator are the Hermite-Gaussians\nλnT/TR\nAn(T, t)\n=\nAn(t)e\n,\n(5.26)\ns\nt\nWn\n-\nAn(t)\n=\n\n2n √\nHn(t/τ a)e 2τ2\na ,\n(5.27)\nπn!τ a\nwhere τ a defines the width of the Gaussian. The width is given by the fourth\nroot of the ratio between gain dispersion and modulator strength\nq\nτ a =\n4 Dg/Ms.\n(5.28)\nNote, from Eq. (5.26) we can follow, that the gain per round-trip of each\neigenmode is given by λn (or in general the real part of λn), which are given\nby\nλn = gn - l - 2Msτ 2\na(n + 1).\n(5.29)\nThe corresponding saturated gain for each eigen solution is given by\ngn =\n,\n(5.30)\n1 + P\nW\nLT\nn\nR\nwhere Wn is the energy of the corresponding solution and PL = EL/τ L the\nsaturation power of the gain. Eq. (5.29) shows that for given g the eigen\nsolution with n = 0, the ground mode, has the largest gain per roundtrip.\nThus, if there is initially a field distribution which is a superpostion of all\neigen solutions, the ground mode will grow fastest and will saturate the gain\nto a value\ngs = l + Msτ 2\na.\n(5.31)\nsuch that λ0 = 0 and consequently all other modes will decay since λn < 0 for\nn ≥ 1. This also proves the stability of the ground mode solution [4]. Thus\nactive modelocking without detuning between resonator round-trip time and\nmodulator period leads to Gaussian steady state pulses with a FWHM pulse\nwidth\n∆tFWHM = 2 ln 2τ a = 1.66τ a.\n(5.32)\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nThe spectrum of the Gaussian pulse is given by\nZ inf\n\niωtdt\nA0(ω)\n=\n\nA0(t)e\n(5.33)\nq-inf\n√\n(ωτa)2\n=\nπWnτ ae -\n,\n(5.34)\nand its FWHM is\n1.66\n∆fFWHM =\n.\n(5.35)\n2πτ a\nTherfore, the time-bandwidth product of the Gaussian is\n∆tFWHM · ∆fFWHM = 0.44.\n(5.36)\nThe stationary pulse shape of the modelocked laser is due to the parabolic\nloss modulation (pulse shortening) in the time domain and the parabolic\nfiltering (pulse stretching) due to the gain in the frequency domain, see Figs.\n5.4 and 5.5. The stationary pulse is achieved when both effects balance.\nSince external modulation is limited to electronic speed and the pulse width\ndoes only scale with the inverse square root of the gain bandwidth actively\nmodelocking typically only results in pulse width in the range of 10-100ps.\nFigure 5.4: (a) Loss modulation gives pulse shortening in each roundtrip\n\n5.2. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING BY LOSS MODULATION\nFigure 5.5: (b) the finite gain bandwidth gives pulse broadening in each\nroundtrip. For a certain pulse width there is balance between the two pro\ncesses.\nFor example: Nd:YAG; 2l = 2g = 10%, Ωg = π∆fFWHM = 0.65 THz,\nM = 0.2, fm = 100 MHz, Dg = 0.24 ps2, Ms = 4 · 1016s-1, τ p ≈ 99 ps.\nWith the pulse width (5.28), Eq.(5.31) can be rewritten in several ways\nDg\n1 Dg\ngs = l + Msτ 2\na = l +\n= l + Msτ 2\na +\n,\n(5.37)\nτ 2 a\n2 τ 2 a\nwhich means that in steady state the saturated gain is lifted above the loss\nlevel l, so that many modes in the laser are maintained above threshold.\nThere is additional gain necessary to overcome the loss of the modulator due\nto the finite temporal width of the pulse and the gain filter due to the finite\nbandwidth of the pulse. Usually\ngs - l\nMsτ 2\n=\na ¿ 1,\n(5.38)\nl\nl\nsince the pulses are much shorter than the round-trip time and the stationary\npulse energy can therefore be computed from\ngs =\nWs = l.\n(5.39)\n1 + PLTR\n\nCHAPTER 5.

The SPM occuring in the gain\nmedium for very short pulses drives the modelocking unstable. Additional\nstabilization measures have to be adopted. For example the addition of\nnegative group delay dispersion might lead to stable soliton formation in the\npresence of the active modelocker.\n5.5\nActive Mode Locking with Soliton For\nmation\nExperimental results with fiber lasers [8, 9, 11] and solid state lasers [10]\nindicated that soliton shaping in the negative GDD regime leads to pulse\nstabilization and considerable pulse shorting. With sufficient negative dis\npersion and self-phase modulation in the system and picosecond or even\nfemtosecond pulses, it is possible that the pulse shaping due to GDD and\nSPM is much stronger than due to modulation and gain filtering, see Fig.\n5.8.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\n5.5.1\nStability Condition\nWe want to show, that a stable soliton can exist in the presence of the\nmodelocker and gain dispersion if the ratio between the negative GDD and\ngain dispersion is sufficiently large. From (5.61) we obtain the equations of\nmotion for the soliton parameters and the continuum by carrying out the\nscalar product with the corresponding adjoint functions. Specifically, for the\nsoliton energy we get\n∂W\nμ\ng\nπ2\n¶\n=\n2 g - l -\n-\nMω2 τ 2 W\n(5.63)\nTR ∂T\n2τ 2\nM\n3Ω\ng\nf(+)\n+ <\n|Rac > .\nw\nWe see that gain saturation does not lead to a coupling between the soliton\nand the continuum to first order in the perturbation, because they are or\nthogonal to each other in the sense of the scalar product (3.36). This also\nmeans that to first order the total field energy is contained in the soliton.\nThus to zero order the stationary soliton energy W0 = 2A2\n0τ is determined\nby the condition that the saturated gain is equal to the total loss due to the\nlinear loss l, gain filtering and modulator loss\nπ2\ng\ng - l =\nMω2\nM τ 2 +\n(5.64)\n2τ 2\n3Ωg\nwith the saturated gain\ng0\ng =\n.\n(5.65)\n1 + W0/EL\nLinearization around this stationary value gives for the soliton perturbations\n\n5.5.

First, the modelocker leads to a restoring force in the timing of the\nsoliton (5.69). Second, the gain dispersion and the active modelocker lead to\ncoupling between the perturbed soliton and the continuum which results in\na steady excitation of the continuum.\nHowever, as we will see later, the pulse width of the soliton, which can be\nstabilized by the modelocker, is not too far from the Gaussian pulse width\nby only active mode locking. Then relation\nωM τ ¿ 1 ¿ Ωgτ\n(5.71)\nis fulfilled. The weak gain dispersion and the weak active modelocker only\ncouples the soliton to the continuum, but to first order the continuum does\nnot couple back to the soliton. Neglecting higher order terms in the matrix\nelements of eq.(5.70) [6] results in a decoupling of the soliton perturbations\nfrom the continuum in (5.66) to (5.70). For a laser far above threshold, i.e.\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nW0/EL >> 1, gain saturation always stabilizes the amplitude perturbation\nand eqs.(5.67) to (5.69) indicate for phase, frequency and timing fluctuations.\nThis is in contrast to the situation in a soliton storage ring where the laser\namplifier compensating for the loss in the ring is below threshold [14].\nBy inverse Fourier transformation of (5.70) and weak coupling, we obtain\nfor the associated function of the continuum\n∙\n∂G\ng\n∂2\nTR\n= g - l + jΦ0 +\n(1 - jDn)\n∂T\nΩ2 g\n∂t2\n\n1⁄2\n(+)|Ra0(x) >\n-M (1 - cos(ωM t)) G + F-1\n< fk\n(5.72)\n3⁄4\n- < fk\n(+)|MωM sin(ωM τx)a0(x) > ∆t\nwhere Dn is the dispersion normalized to the gain dispersion\nDn = |D|Ω2\ng/g.\n(5.73)\nNote, that the homogeneous part of the equation of motion for the continuum,\nwhich governs the decay of the continuum, is the same as the homogeneous\npart of the equation for the noise in a soliton storage ring at the position\nwhere no soliton or bit is present [14]. Thus the decay of the continuum is\nnot affected by the nonlinearity, but there is a continuous excitation of the\ncontinuum by the soliton when the perturbing elements are passed by the\nsoliton. Thus under the above approximations the question of stability of\nthe soliton solution is completely governed by the stability of the continuum\n(5.72). As we can see from (5.72) the evolution of the continuum obeys\nthe active mode locking equation with GVD but with a value for the gain\ndetermined by (5.64). In the parabolic approximation of the cosine, we obtain\nagain the Hermite Gaussians as the eigensolutions for the evolution operator\nbut the width of these eigensolutions is now given by\np\nτ c = τ a\n4 (1 - jDn)\n(5.74)\nand the associated eigenvalues are\nM τ 2p\nλm = jΦ0 + g - l - Mω2\na\n(1 - jDn)(m +\n).\n(5.75)\n\n5.5.

The crit\nical value for the pulse width reduction is Rcrit ≈ 1.2. For large normalized\ndispersion Fig. 1 shows that the soliton can be kept stable at a pulse width\nreduced by up to a factor of 5 when the normalized dispersion can reach a\nvalue of 200. Even at a moderate negative dispersion of Dn = 5, we can\nachieve a pulsewidth reduction by a factor of 2.

For the soli\nton the action of GVD and SPM is always in balance and maintains the\npulse shape. However, as can be seen from (5.72), the continuum, which can\nbe viewed as a weak background pulse, does not experience SPM once it is\ngenerated and therefore gets spread by GVD. This is also the reason why\nthe eigenstates of the continuum consist of long chirped pulses that scale\n\n5.5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING WITH SOLITON FORMATION\nalso with the fourth root of the dispersion (5.74). Then, the long continuum\npulses suffer a much higher loss in the active modulator in contrast to the\nshort soliton which suffers reduced gain when passing the gain medium due\nto its broader spectrum. The soliton is stable as long as the continuum sees\nless roundtrip gain than the soliton.\nIn principle by introducing a large amount of negative dispersion the\ntheory would predict arbitrarily short pulses. However, the master equation\n(5.55) only describes the laser system properly when the nonlinear changes of\nthe pulse per pass are small. This gives an upper limit to the nonlinear phase\nshift Φ0 that the soliton can undergo during one roundtrip. A conservative\nestimation of this upper limit is given with Φ0 = 0.1. Then the action of\nthe individual operators in (5.55) can still be considered as continuous. Even\nif one considers larger values for the maximum phase shift allowed, since in\nfiber lasers the action of GVD and SPM occurs simultaneously and therefore\neq.(5.55) may describe the laser properly even for large nonlinear phase shifts\nper roundtrip, one will run into intrinsic soliton and sideband instabilities for\nΦ0 approaching 2π [30, 31]. Under the condition of a limited phase shift per\nroundtrip we obtain\n|D|\nτ 2 =\n.\n(5.82)\nΦ0\nThus from (5.32), the definition of ξ, (5.81) and (5.82) we obtain for the\nmaximum possible reduction in pulsewidth\ns\n1.66\n(9Φ0/2)2\nRmax =\n(5.83)\n1.76\nDg Ms\nand therefore for the minimum pulsewidth\ns\n2D2\nτ min =\ng .\n(5.84)\n9Φ0 Ms\nThe necessary amount of normalized negative GVD is then given by\ns\n2 3 (9Φ0/2)2\nDn =\n.\n(5.85)\nDg Ms\nEqs.(5.83) to (5.85) constitute the main results of this paper, because they\nallow us to compute the possible pulse width reduction and the necessary\n\nCHAPTER 5.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING WITH SOLITON FORMATION\nnegative GVD for a given laser system. Table (5.1) shows the evaluation of\nthese formulas for several gain media and typical laser parameters.\nTable 5.1 shows that soliton formation in actively mode-locked lasers may\nlead to considerable pulse shortening, up to a factor of 10 in Ti:sapphire. Due\nto the 12th root in (5.83) the shortening depends mostly on the bandwidth\nof the gain material which can change by several orders of magnitude for the\ndifferent laser materials. The amount of negative dispersion for achieving this\nadditional pulse shortening is in a range which can be achieved by gratings,\nGires-Tournois interferometers, or prisms.\nOf course, in the experiment one has to stay away from these limits\nto suppress the continuum sufficiently. However, as numerical simulations\nshow, the transition from stable to instable behaviour is remarkably sharp.\nThe reason for this can be understood from the structure of the eigenvalues\nfor the continuum (5.76). The time scale for the decay of transients is given\nby the inverse of the real part of the fundamental continuum mode which\ndiverges at the transition to instability. Nevertheless, a good estimate for\nthis transient time is given by the leading term of the real part of (5.76)\nτ trans\n=\n≈ p\n(5.86)\nTR\nRe{λ0}\nDgMsR2\nThis transient time is also shown in Table (5.1) for different laser systems.\nThus these transients decay, if not too close to the instability border, on time\nscales from approximately 1,000 up to some 100,000 roundtrips, depending\nstrongly on the gain bandwidth and modulation strength. Consequently, to\nfirst order the eigenvalues of the continuum modes, which are excited by the\nright hand side of (5.72), are purely imaginary and independent of the mode\nnumber, i.e. λn ≈ jΦ0. Therefore, as long as the continuum is stable, the\nsolution to (5.72) is given by\n1⁄2\n-j\n(+)\nG(x)\n=\n\nF-1\n< fk |Ra0(x) >\nΦ0\n3⁄4\n(+)|xa0(\n- Msτ 2 < fk\nx) > ∆t\n.\n(5.87)\nτ\nThus, in steady state the continuum is on the order of\nA0 Dg\nA0\n|G(x)| ≈\nτ 2 =\n.\n(5.88)\nΦ0\nDn\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nwhich demonstrates again the spreading of the continuum by the dispersion.\nEquation (5.88) shows that the nonlinear phase shift of the solitary pulse\nper round trip has to be chosen as large as possible. This also maximizes\nthe normalized dispersion, so that the radiation shed from the soliton into\nthe continuum changes the phase rapidly enough such that the continuum\nin steady state stays small. Note that the size of the generated continuum\naccording to (5.88) is rather independent of the real part of the lowest eigen\nvalue of the continuum mode. Therefore, the border to instability is very\nsharply defined. However, the time scale of the transients at the transition\nto instability can become arbitrarily long. Therefore, numerical simulations\nare only trustworthy if the time scales for transients in the system are known\nfrom theoretical considerations as those derived above in (5.86). The simu\nlation time for a given laser should be at least of the order of 10 times τ trans\nor even longer, if operated close to the instability point, as we will see in the\nnext section.\n5.5.2\nNumerical simulations\nTable 5.1 shows that soliton formation in actively mode-locked lasers may\nlead to considerable pulse shortening, up to a factor of 10 in Ti:sapphire. We\nwant to illustrate that at the example of a Nd:YAG laser, which is chosen\ndue to its moderate gain bandwidth, and therefore, its large gain dispersion.\nThis will limit the pulsewidth reduction possible to about 3, but the decay\ntime of the continuum (5.86) (see also Table 5.1) is then in a range of 700\nroundtrips so that the steady state of the mode-locked laser can be reached\nwith moderate computer time, while the approximations involved are still\nsatisfied. The system parameters used for the simulation are shown in table\n5.2. For the simulation of eq.(5.55) we use the standard split-step Fourier\ntransform method. Here the discrete action of SPM and GDD per roundtrip\nis included by choosing the integration step size for the T integration to be\nthe roundtrip time TR. We used a discretisation of 1024 points over the\nbandwidth of 1THz, which corresponds to a resolution in the time domain\nof 1ps.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nlaser should be in steady state again with a FWHM pulsewidth of 24 ps.\nFig. 5.10 shows the pulse evolution over the first thousand round-trips, i.e.\n4μs real time. The long Gaussian pulse at the start contains an appreciable\namount of continuum. The continuum part of the solution does not experi\nence the nonlinear phase shift due to SPM in contrast to the soliton. Thus\nthe soliton interferes with the continuum periodically with the soliton period\nof Tsoliton/TR = 2π/φ0 = 20π. This is the reason for the oscillations of the\npulse amplitude seen in Fig. 5.10 which vanish with the decay of the con\ntinuum. Note also that the solitary pulse is rapidly formed, due to the large\nnonlinear phase shift per roundtrip. Figure 5.11 shows the simulation in time\nand frequency domain over 10,000 roundtrips. The laser reaches steady state\nafter about 4,000 roundtrips which corresponds to 6 × τ trans and the final\npulsewidth is 24 ps in exact agreement with the predictions of the analytic\nformulas derived above.\nLower normalized dispersion of Dn = 15 or D = -10 ps2 only allows for\na reduction in pulsewidth by R = 2.68. However, using the same amount of\nSPM as before we leave the range of stable soliton generation.\n\n5.5.

The continuum in this case does not decay as in Fig. 5.2 and 5.3\ndue to the insufficient dispersion. (b) Same simulation over 50,000 round-\ntrips.\n\n5.5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING WITH SOLITON FORMATION\nFigure 5.12(a) shows similar to Fig. 5.10 the first 1, 000 roundtrips in\nthat case. Again the solitary pulse is rapidly formed out of the long Gaussian\ninitial pulse. But in contrast to the situation in Fig. 5.10, the continuum does\nnot any longer decay on this time scale. The dispersion is too low to spread\nthe continuum rapidly enough. The continuum then accumulates over many\nroundtrips as can be seen from Fig. 5.12(b). After about 10,000 roundtrips\nthe continuum has grown so much that it extracts an appreciable amount of\nenergy from the soliton. But surprisingly the continuum modes stop growing\nafter about 30,000 roundtrips and a new quasi stationary state is reached.\n5.5.3\nExperimental Verification\nThe theory above explains very well the ps Ti:saphire experiments [10] in\nthe regime where the pulses are stabilized by the active modelocker alone.\nGires-Tournois interferometers were used to obtain large amounts of negative\nGDD to operate the laser in the stable soliton regime derived above. Here\nwe want to discuss in more detail the experimental results obtained recently\nwith a regeneratively, actively mode-locked Nd:glass laser [7], resulting in 310\nfs. If SPM and GVD could be neglected, the weak modelocker would produce\nGaussian pulses with a FWHM of τ a,F W HM = 10 ps. However, the strong\nSPM prevents stable pulse formation. The negative dispersion available in\nthe experiment is too low to achieve stable soliton formation, because the\npulse width of the soliton at this power level is given by τ = 4|D|/(δW ) =\n464 fs, for the example discussed. The normalized dispersion is not large\nenough to allow for such a large pulse width reduction. Providing enough\nnegative dispersion results in a 310 fs perfectly sech-shaped soliton-like pulse\nas shown in Fig. 5.13. A numerical simulation of this case would need millions\nof roundtrips through the cavity until a stationary state is reached. That\nmeans milliseconds of real time, but would necessitate days of computer\ntime. Also the transition to instable behaviour has been observed, which is\nthe characteristic occurence of a short solitary fs-pulse together with a long\nps-pulse due to the instable continuum as we have found in the numerical\nsimulation for the case of a Nd:YAG laser (see Fig. 5.12(b)). Figure 5.14\nshows the signal of a fast detector diode on the sampling oscilloscope. The\ndetector has an overall bandwidth of 25GHz and therefore can not resolve\nthe fs-pulse, but can resolve the width of the following roughly 100ps long\npulse.\n\nCHAPTER 5.

SUMMARY\n5.6\nSummary\nThe main result of this section is, that pure active mode-locking with an\namplitude modulator leads to Gaussian pulses. The width is inverse propor\ntional to the square root of the gain bandwdith. A phase modulator leads\nto chirped Gaussian pulses. A soliton much shorter than the Gaussian pulse\ndue to pure active mode locking can be stabilized by an active modelocker.\nThis finding also has an important consequence for passive mode locking. It\nimplies that a slow saturable absorber, i.e. an absorber with a recovery time\nmuch longer than the width of the soliton, is enough to stabilize the pulse,\ni.e. to modelock the laser.\n\nCHAPTER 5.

ACTIVE MODELOCKING WITH DETUNING\n5.7\nActive Modelocking with Detuning\nSo far, we only considered the case of perfect synchronism between the round-\ntrip of the pulse in the cavity and the external modulator. Technically,\nsuch perfect synchronism is not easy to achieve. One way would be to do\nregenerative mode locking, i.e. a part of the output signal of the modelocked\nlaser is detected, the beatnote at the round-trip frequency is filtered out from\nthe detector, and sent to an amplifier, which drives the modulator. This\nprocedure enforces synchronism if the cavity length undergoes fluctuations\ndue to acoustic vibrations and thermal expansion.\nNevertheless, it is interesting to know how sensitive the system is against\ndetuning between the modulator and the resonator. It turns out that this\nis a physically and mathematically rich situation, which applies to many\nother phenomena occuring in externally driven systems, such as the transi\ntion from laminar to turbulent flow in hydrodynamics. This transition has\npuzzled physicists for more than a hundred years [1]. During the last 5 to\n10 years, a scenario for the transition to turbulence has been put forward\nby Trefethen and others [2]. This model gives not only a quantitative de\nscription of the kind of instability that leads to a transition from laminar,\ni.e. highly ordered dynamics, to turbulent flow, i.e. chaotic motion, but also\nan intuitive physical picture why turbulence is occuring. Such a picture is\nthe basis for many laser instabilities especially in synchronized laser systems.\nAccording to this theory, turbulence is due to strong transient growth of\ndeviations from a stable stationary point of the system together with a non\nlinear feedback mechanism. The nonlinear feedback mechanism couples part\nof the amplified perturbation back into the initial perturbation. Therefore,\nthe perturbation experiences strong growth repeatedly. Once the transient\ngrowth is large enough, a slight perturbation from the stable stationary point\nrenders the system into turbulence. Small perturbations are always present\nin real systems in the form of system intrinsic noise or environmental noise\nand, in computer simulations, due to the finite precision. The predictions\nof the linearized stability analysis become meaningless in such cases. The\ndetuned actively modelocked laser is an excellent example of such a system,\nwhich in addition can be studied analytically. The detuned case has been\nonly studied experimentally [3][4] or numerically [5] so far. Here, we con\nsider an analytical approach. Note, that this type of instability can not be\ndetected by a linear stability analysis which is widely used in laser theories\nand which we use in this course very often to prove stable pulse formation.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nOne has to be aware that such situations may arise, where the results of a\nlinearized stability analysis have only very limited validity.\nThe equation of motion for the pulse envelope in an actively modelocked\nlaser with detuning can be writen as\n∙\n∂A(T, t)\n∂2\nTM\n=\ng(T) - l + Df\n(5.89)\n∂T\n∂t2\n\n-M (1 - cos(ωM t)) + Td\n∂\nA(T, t).\n∂t\nHere, A(T, t) is the pulse envelope as before. There is the time T which is\ncoarse grained on the time scale of the resonator round-trip time TR and\nthe time t, which resolves the resulting pulse shape. The saturated gain is\ndenoted by g(T) and left dynamical, because we no longer assume that the\ngain and field dynamics reaches a steady state eventually. The curvature of\nthe intracavity losses in the frequency domain, which limit the bandwidth of\nthe laser, is given by Df .and left fixed for simplicity. M is the depth of the\nloss modulation introduced by the modulator with angular frequency ωM =\n2π/TM, where TM is the modulator period. Note that Eq.(5.89) describes the\nchange in the pulse between one period of modulation. The detuning between\nresonator round-trip time and the modulator period is Td = TM - TR.This\ndetuning means that the pulse hits the modulator with some temporal off-set\nafter one round-trip, which can be described by adding the term Td\n∂\n∂tA in the\nmaster equation.The saturated gain g obeys a separate ordinary differential\nequation\n∂g(T)\ng(T) - g0\nW(T)\n= -\n- g\n.\n(5.90)\n∂T\nτ L\nPL\nAs before, g0 is the small signal gain due to the pumping, PL the saturationR\npower of the gain medium, τ L the gain relaxation time and W(T) =\n|A(T, t)|2 dt the total field energy stored in the cavity at time T.\nAs before, we expect pulses with a pulse width much shorter than the\nround-trip time in the cavity and we assume that they still will be placed\nin time near the position where the modulator introduces low loss (Figure\n5.15), so that we can still approximate the cosine by a parabola\n∙\n\n∂2\nTM\n∂A = g - l + Df\n- Mst + Td\n∂ A.\n(5.91)\n∂T\n∂t2\n∂t\n\n5.7.

The displacement A is caused by the mismatch between the cavity\nround-trip time and the modulator period. The displacement B is due to\nunequal losses experienced by the front and the back of the pulse in the\nmodulator. The gain saturates to a level where a possible stationary pulse\nexperiences no net gain or loss, which opens up a net gain window following\nthe pulse. Perturbations within that window get amplified while drifting\ntowards the stationary pulse.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nHere, Ms = Mω2 /2 is the curvature of the loss modulation at the point\nM\nof minimum loss as before. The time t is now allowed to range from -inf to\n+inf, since the modulator losses make sure that only during the physically\nallowed range -TR/2 ¿ t ¿ TR/2 radiation can build up.\nIn the case of vanishing detuning, i.e. Td = 0, the differential operator\non the right side of (5.91), which generates the dynamics and is usually\ncalled a evolution operator L,\nˆ correspondes to the Schrodinger operator of\nthe harmonic oscillator.

ACTIVE MODELOCKING WITH DETUNING\nThe eigenvalues prove that, for a given pulse energy, the mode with n = 0,\nwhich we call the ground mode, experiences the largest gain. Consequently,\nthe ground mode will saturate the gain to a value such that λ0 = 0 in steady\nstate and all other modes experience net loss, λn < 0 for n > 0, as discussed\nbefore. This is a stable situation as can be shown rigorously by a linearized\nstability analysis [6]. Thus active modelocking with perfect synchronization\nproduces Gaussian pulses with a 1/e--half width of the intensity profile given\nby τ a.\nIn the case of non zero detuning Td, the situation becomes more complex.\nThe evolution operator, (5.93), changes to\n∙\n\np\n¡\n¢\nLˆ D = g - l - 2 Df Ms\naˆ+ - ∆ (ˆa + ∆) + ( + ∆2)\n(5.97)\nwith the normalized detuning\nTd\n∆ = p\n.\n(5.98)\n2Df Ms τ a\nIntroducing the shifted creation and annihilation operators, ˆb+ = ˆa+ + ∆ and\nˆb = ˆa + ∆, respectively, we obtain\n\np\nLˆ D = ∆g - 2 Df Ms ˆb+ˆb - 2∆ˆb\n(5.99)\nwith the excess gain\np\n∆g = g - l - 2 Df Ms(\n+ ∆2)\n(5.100)\ndue to the detuning. Note, that the resulting evolution operator is not any\n£\n¤\nlonger hermitian and even not normal, i.e.\nA, A+ 6= 0, which causes the\neigenmodes to become nonnormal [8]. Nevertheless, it is an easy excercise to\ncompute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the new evolution operator in\nterms of the eigenstates of ˆb+ˆb, |li , which are the Hermite Gaussians centered\naround ∆. The eigenvectors |φ i to Lˆ D are found by the ansatz\nn\nX\nn\nn - l\nn\nn\nn\n|φ i =\nc |li , with c\n=\n√\ncl .\n(5.101)\nn\nl\nl+1\n2∆ l + 1\nl=0\np\nThe new eigenvalues are λn = gn - l - 2 Df Ms(∆2 + n + 0.5). By inspec\ntion, it is again easy to see, that the new eigenstates form a complete basis in\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nL2(IR). However, the eigenvectors are no longer orthogonal to each other. The\neigensolutions as a function of time are given as a product of a Hermite Poly\nh\n√\ni\np -(t- 2∆τa)2\nnomial and a shifted Gaussian un(t) = ht |φ i ∼ Hn(t/τ a) ex\n.\nn\n2τ2\na\nAgain, a linearized stability analysis shows that the ground mode, i.e.|φ0i ,\na Gaussian, is a stable stationary solution. Surprisingly, the linearized anal\nysis predicts stability of the ground mode for all values of the detuning in\nthe parabolic modulation and gain approximation. This result is even inde\npendent from the dynamics of the gain, i.e. the upper state lifetime of the\nactive medium, as long as there is enough gain to support the pulse. Only\n√\nthe position of the maximum of the ground mode,\n2∆ · τ a, depends on the\nnormalized detuning.\nFigure 5.15 summarizes the results obtained so far. In the case of de\ntuning, the center of the stationary Gaussian pulse is shifted away from the\nposition of minimum loss of the modulator. Since the net gain and loss within\none round-trip in the laser cavity has to be zero for a stationary pulse, there\nis a long net gain window following the pulse in the case of detuning due\nto the necessary excess gain. Figure 2 shows a few of the resulting lowest\norder eigenfunctions for the case of a normalized detuning ∆ = 0 in (a) and\n∆ = 0.32 in (b). These eigenfunctions are not orthogonal as a result of the\nnonnormal evolution operator\n5.7.1\nDynamics of the Detuned Actively Mode-locked\nLaser\nTo get insight into the dynamics of the system, we look at computer simu\nlations for a Nd:YLF Laser with the parameters shown in Table 5.3 Figures\nEL = 366 μJ\ng0 = 0.79\nτ L = 450 μs\nMs = 2.467 · 1017s-2\n-26\nΩg = 1.12 THz Dg = 2 · 10\ns\nTR = 4 ns\nτ a = 17 ps\nl = 0.025\nλ0 = 1.047 μm\nM = 0.2\nTable 5.3: Data used in the simulations of a Nd:YLF laser.\n5.17 show the temporal evolution of the coefficient cn,when the master equa\n\ncoefficients cn\ngain (g - gss) / gss\n5.7.

In this model, we did not inlcude the spontaneous\nemission.\nThe transition to turbulence always occurs at a normalized detuning of\nabout ∆ ≈ 3.7 which gives a transient gain exp(2∆2) = 1012 . This means that\nalready uncertainties of the numerical integration algorithm are amplified to\na perturbation as large as the stationary state itself.To prove that the system\ndynamics becomes really chaotic, one has to compute the Liapunov coefficient\n[9]. The Liapunov coefficient describes how fast the phase space trajectores\nseparate from each other, if they start in close proximity. It is formally\ndefined in the following way. Two trajectories y(t) and z(t) start in close\nvicinity at t = t0\nky(t0) - z(t0)k = ε = 10-4 .\n(5.106)\nThen, the system is run for a certain time ∆t and the logarithmic growth\nrate, i.e. Liapunov coefficient, of the distance between both trajectories is\nevaluated using\nμ\n¶\nky(t0 + ∆t) - z(t0 + ∆t)k\nλ0 = ln\n(5.107)\nε\nFor the next iteration the trajectory z(t) is rescaled along the distance be\ntween y(t0 + ∆t) and z(t0 + ∆t) according to\ny(t0 + ∆t) - z(t0 + ∆t)\nz(t1) = y(t0 + ∆t) + ε\n.\n(5.108)\nky(t0 + ∆t) - z(t0 + ∆t)k\nThe new points of the trajectories z(t1 +∆t) and y(t1 +∆t) = y(t0 +2∆t) are\ncalculated and a new estimate for the Liapunov coefficient λ1 is calculated\nusing Eq.(5.107) with new indices. This procedure is continued and the\nLiapunov coefficient is defined as the average of all the approximations over\na long enough iteration, so that its changes are below a certain error bound\nfrom iteration to iteration.\nN\n1 X\nλ =\nλn\n(5.109)\nN n=0\nFigure 5.26 shows the Liapunov coefficient of the Nd:YLF laser discussed\nabove, as a function of the normlized detuning. When the Liapunov coef\nficient becomes positive, i.e. the system becomes exponentially sensitive to\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nsmall changes in the initial conditions, the system is called chaotic. The\ngraph clearly indicates that the dynamics is chaotic above a critical detuning\nof about ∆c ≈ 3.7.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nKaertner, F. X., et al. \"Turbulence in Mode-locked Lasers\". Physical Review Letters 82, no. 22\n(May 1999): 4428-4431.\nFigure 5.26: Liapunov coefficient over normalized detuning.\nIn the turbulent regime, the system does not reach a steady state, because\nit is nonperiodically interrupted by a new pulse created out of the net gain\nwindow, see Figure 5.15, following the pulse for positive detuning. This pulse\nsaturates the gain and the nearly formed steady state pulse is destroyed and\nfinally replaced by a new one. The gain saturation provides the nonlinear\nfeedback mechanism, which strongly perturbs the system again, once a strong\nperturbation grows up due to the transient linear amplification mechanism.\nThe critical detuning becomes smaller if additional noise sources, such as\nthe spontaneous emission noise of the laser amplifier and technical noise\nsources are taken into account. However, due to the super exponential\ngrowth, the critical detuning will not depend strongly on the strength of\nthe noise sources. If the spontaneous emission noise is included in the sim\nulation, we obtain the same shape for the critical detuning as in Fig. 5.25,\nhowever the critical detuning is lowered to about ∆c ≈ 2. Note that this crit\nical detuning is very insensitive to any other changes in the parameters of the\nsystem. Therefore, one can expect that actively mode-locked lasers without\nregenerative feedback run unstable at a real detuning, see (5.98) given by\np\nTd = 4 2Df Msτ a\n(5.110)\n\n5.7. ACTIVE MODELOCKING WITH DETUNING\nFor the above Nd:YLF laser, using the values in Table 5.3 results in a relative\nprecision of the modulation frequency of\nTd = 1.7 · 10-6 .\nTR\nThe derived value for the frequency stability can easily be achieved and\nmaintained with modern microwave synthesizers. However, this requires that\nthe cavity length of Nd:YLF laser is also stable to this limit. Note that the\nthermal expansion coefficient for steel is 1.6 · 10-5/K.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBibliography\n[1] Lord Kelvin, Philos. Mag. 24, 188 (1887); A. Sommerfeld, Int. Mathem.\nKongr.

In active modelocking one is limited to the speed of electronic signal\ngenerators. Therefore, this curvature can never be very strong. However, if\nthe pulse can modulate the absorption on its own, the curvature of the ab\nsorption modulationcan become large, or in other words the net gain window\ngenerated by the pulse can be as short as the pulse itself. In this case, the\nnet gain window shortens with the pulse. Therefore, passively modelocked\nlasers can generate much shorter pulses than actively modelocked lasers.\nHowever, a suitable saturable absorber is required for passive modelock\ning. Depending on the ratio between saturable absorber recovery time and fi\nnal pulse width, one may distinguish between the regimes of operation shown\nin Figure 6.1, which depicts the final steady state pulse formation process.\nIn a solid state laser with intracavity pulse energies much lower than the sat\nuration energy of the gain medium, gain saturation can be neglected. Then\na fast saturable absorber must be present that opens and closes the net gain\nwindow generated by the pulse immediately before and after the pulse. This\nmodelocking principle is called fast saturable absorber modelocking, see Fig\nure 6.1 a).\nIn semiconductor and dye lasers usually the intracavity pulse energy ex\nceeds the saturation energy of the gain medium and so the the gain medium\nundergoes saturation. A short net gain window can still be created, almost\nindependent of the recovery time of the gain, if a similar but unpumped\nmedium is introduced into the cavity acting as an absorber with a somewhat\nlower saturation energy then the gain medium. For example, this can be\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nKartner, F. X., and U. Keller. \"Stabilization of soliton-like pulses with a slow saturable absorber.\"\nOptics Letters 20 (1990): 16-19.\nFigure 6.1: Pulse-shaping and stabilization mechanisms owing to gain and\nloss dynamics in passively mode-locked lasers: (a) using only a fast saturable\nabsorber; (b) using a combination of gain and loss saturation; (c) using a\nsaturable absorber with a finite relaxation time and soliton formation.\narranged for by stronger focusing in the absorber medium than in the gain\nmedium. Then the absorber bleaches first and opens a net gain window,\nthat is closed by the pulse itself by bleaching the gain somewhat later, see\nFigure 6.1 b). This principle of modelocking is called slow-saturable absorber\nmodelocking.\nWhen modelocking of picosecond and femtosecond lasers with semicon\nductor saturable absorbers has been developed it became obvious that even\nwith rather slow absorbers, showing recovery times of a few picoseconds, one\nwas able to generate sub-picosecond pulses resulting in a significant net gain\nwindow after the pulse, see Figure 6.1 c). From our investigation of active\nmodelocking in the presence of soliton formation, we can expect that such a\nsituation may still be stable up to a certain limit in the presence of strong\nsoliton formation. This is the case and this modelocking regime is called\nsoliton modelocking, since solitary pulse formation due to SPM and GDD\nshapes the pulse to a stable sech-shape despite the open net gain window\nfollowing the pulse.\n\n6.1. SLOW SATURABLE ABSORBER MODE LOCKING\n6.1\nSlow Saturable Absorber Mode Locking\nDue to the small cross section for stimulated emission in solid state lasers,\ntypical intracavity pulse energies are much smaller than the saturation energy\nof the gain. Therefore, we neglected the effect of gain saturation due to one\npulse sofar, the gain only saturates with the average power. However, there\nare gain media which have large gain cross sections like semiconductors and\ndyes, see Table 4.1, and typical intracavity pulse energies may become large\nenough to saturate the gain considerably in a single pass. In fact, it is this\neffect, which made the mode-locked dye laser so sucessful. The model for the\nslow saturable absorber mode locking has to take into account the change\nof gain in the passage of one pulse [1, 2]. In the following, we consider a\nmodelocked laser, that experiences in one round-trip a saturable gain and a\nslow saturable absorber. In the dye laser, both media are dyes with different\nsaturation intensities or with different focusing into the dye jets so that gain\nand loss may show different saturation energies. The relaxation equation of\nthe gain, in the limit of a pulse short compared with its relaxation time, can\nbe approximated by\ndg\n|A(t)|2\n= -g\n(6.1)\ndt\nEL\nThe coefficient EL is the saturation energy of the gain. Integration of the\nequation shows, that the gain saturates with the pulse energy E(t)\nZ t\nE(t) =\ndt|A(t)|2\n(6.2)\n-TR/2\nwhen passing the gain\ng(t) = gi exp [-E(t)/EL]\n(6.3)\nwhere gi is the initial small signal gain just before the arrival of the pulse. A\nsimilar equation holds for the loss of the saturable absorber whose response\n(loss) is represented by q(t)\nq(t) = q0 exp [-E(t)/EA]\n(6.4)\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nwhere EA is the saturation energy of the saturable absorber. If the back\nground loss is denoted by l, the master equation of mode-locking becomes\n1 ∂A =\n[gi (exp (-E(t)/EL)) A - lA-\nTR ∂T\n(6.5)\nq0 exp (-E(t)/EA)] A + Ω\n2 ∂t\n∂2\n2 A\nf\nHere, we have replaced the filtering action of the gain Dg = Ω\n1 as\nf\nproduced by a separate fixed filter. An analytic solution to this integro\ndifferential equation can be obtained with one approximation: the exponen\ntials are expanded to second order. This is legitimate if the population deple\ntions of the gain and saturable absorber media are not excessive. Consider\none of these expansions:\n∙\n\nq0 exp (-E(t)/EA) ≈ q0 1 - (E(t)/EA) + 1 (E(t)/EA)\n.\n(6.6)\nWe only consider the saturable gain and loss and the finite gain bandwidth.\nThan the master equation is given by\n∙\n\n∂A(T, t)\n∂2\nTR\n= g(t) - q(t) - l + Df\nA(T, t).\n(6.7)\n∂T\n∂t2\nThe filter dispersion, Df = 1/Ω2\nf , effectively models the finite bandwidth\nof the laser, that might not be only due to the finite gain bandwidth, but\nincludes all bandwidth limiting effects in a parabolic approximation. Sup\npose the pulse is a symmetric function of time. Then the first power of the\nintegral gives an antisymmetric function of time, its square is symmetric.\nAn antisymmetric function acting on the pulse A(t) causes a displacement.\nHence, the steady state solution does not yield zero for the change per pass,\nthe derivative 1 ∂A must be equated to a time shift ∆t of the pulse. When\nTR ∂T\nthis is done one can confirm easily that A(t) = Ao sech(t/τ) is a solution of\n(6.6) with constraints on its coefficients. Thus we, are looking for a \"steady\nstate\" solution A(t, T ) = Ao sech(τ\nt + αT\nT ).Note, that α is the fraction of\nR\nthe pulsewidth, the pulse is shifted in each round-trip due to the shaping by\nloss and gain. The constraints on its coefficients can be easily found using\n\n6.1.

The saturable\nabsorber must saturate more easily, and, therefore more strongly, than the\ngain medium in order to open a net window of gain (Figure 6.2).\nThis was accomplished in a dye laser system by stronger focusing into\nthe saturable absorber-dye jet (Reducing the saturation energy for the sat\nurable absorber) than into the gain-dye jet (which was inverted, i.e. optically\n\nCHAPTER 6.

Since the pulse has the same exponential tail after passage\nas before, one concludes that the net gain after passage of the pulse is the\nsame as before passage and thus also negative. The pulse is stable against\nnoise build-up both in its front and its back. This principle works if the\nratio between the saturation energies for the saturable absorber and gain\nχP = EA/EP is very small. Then the shortest pulsewidth achievable with a\ngiven system is\nEA\nτ = √\n> √\n.\n(6.17)\nq0Ωf W\nq0Ωf\nThe greater sign comes from the fact that our theory is based on the ex\npansion of the exponentials, which is only true for 2\nW\nEA < 1. If the filter\ndispersion 1/Ω2\nf that determines the bandwidth of the system is again re\nplaced by an average gain dispersion g/Ω2\ng and assuming g = q0. Note that\nthe modelocking principle of the dye laser is a very faszinating one due to\nthe fact that actually non of the elements in the system is fast. It is the in\nterplay between two media that opens a short window in time on the scale of\nfemtoseconds. The media themselves just have to be fast enough to recover\ncompletely between one round trip, i.e. on a nanosecond timescale.\nOver the last fifteen years, the dye laser has been largely replaced by\nsolid state lasers, which offer even more bandwidth than dyes and are on top\nof that much easier to handle because they do not show degradation over\ntime. With it came the need for a different mode locking principle, since the\nsaturation energy of these broadband solid-state laser media are much higher\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nthan the typical intracavity pulse energies. The absorber has to open and\nclose the net gain window.\n6.2\nFast Saturable Absorber Mode Locking\nThe dynamics of a laser modelocked with a fast saturable absorber is again\ncovered by the master equation (5.21) [3]. Now, the losses q react instantly\non the intensity or power P(t) = |A(t)|2 of the field\nq0\nq(A) =\n,\n(6.18)\n|A|2\n1 + PA\nwhere PA is the saturation power of the absorber. There is no analytic\nsolution of the master equation (5.21) with the absorber response (6.18).\nTherefore, we make expansions on the absorber response to get analytic\ninsight. If the absorber is not saturated, we can expand the response (6.18)\nfor small intensities\nq(A) = q0 - γ|A|2 ,\n(6.19)\nwith the saturable absorber modulation coefficient γ = q0/PA. The constant\nnonsaturated loss q0 can be absorbed in the losses l0 = l + q0.

FAST SATURABLE ABSORBER MODE LOCKING\nNote that in contrast to active modelocking, now the achievable pulse width\nis scaling with the inverse gain bandwidth, which gives much shorter pulses.\nFigure 6.4 can be interpreted as follows: In steady state, the saturated gain is\nbelow loss, by about one half of the exploited saturable loss before and after\nthe pulse. This means, that there is net loss outside the pulse, which keeps\nthe pulse stable against growth of instabilities at the leading and trailing\nedge of the pulse. If there is stable mode-locked operation, there must be\nalways net loss far away from the pulse, otherwise, a continuous wave signal\nrunning at the peak of the gain would experience more gain than the pulse\nand would break through. From Eq.(6.35) follows, that one third of the\nexploited saturable loss is used up during saturation of the aborber and\nactually only one sixth is used to overcome the filter losses due to the finite\ngain bandwidth. Note, there is a limit to the mimium pulse width, which\ncomes about, because the saturated gain (6.27) is gs = l+ 2\n1 q0 and, therefore,\nfrom Eq.(6.40), if we assume that the finite bandwidth of the laser is set by\nthe gain, i.e. Df\n=\nwe obtain for q0 A l\n= Dg\nΩ\ng\ng\nτ min =\n(6.41)\nΩg\nfor the linearly saturating absorber model.

(d) Phase shift per pass. [4]\nFigure 6.6 (a-d) indicate that there are essentially three operating regimes.\nFirst, without GDD and SPM, the pulses are always stable. Second, if there\nis strong soliton-like pulse shaping, i.e. δn A 1 and -Dn A 1 the chirp is\nalways much smaller than for positive dispersion and the pulses are soliton\nlike. At last, the pulses are even chirp free, if the condition δn = -Dn is\nfulfilled. Then the solution is\nμ\nμ ¶¶\nt\njψT/TR\nAs(T, t) = A0 sech\ne\n, for δn = -Dn.\n(6.61)\nτ\n\n6.3. SOLITON MODE LOCKING\nNote, for this discussion we always assumed a positive SPM-coefficient. In\nthis regime we also obtain the shortest pulses directly from the system, which\ncan be a factor 2-3 shorter than by pure saturable absorber modelocking.\nNote that Figure 6.6 indicates even arbitrarily shorter pulses if the nonlinear\nindex, i.e. δn is further increased. However, this is only an artificat of\nthe linear approximation of the saturable absorber, which can now become\narbitrarily large, compare (6.18) and (6.19). As we have found from the\nanalysis of the fast saturable absorber model, Figure 6.4, only one sixth of\nthe saturable absorption is used for overcoming the gain filtering. This is so,\nbecause the saturable absorber has to shape and stabilize the pulse against\nbreakthrough of cw-radiation. With SPM and GDD this is relaxed. The\npulse shaping can be done by SPM and GDD alone, i.e. soliton formation\nand the absorber only has to stabilize the pulse. But then all of the saturable\nabsorption can be used up for stability, i.e. six times as much, which allows\n√\nfor additional pulse shorteing by a factor of about\n6 = 2.5 in a parbolic\nfilter situation. Note, that for an experimentalist a factor of three is a large\nnumber. This tells us that the 6.5 fs limit for Ti:sapphire derived above from\nthe saturable absorber model can be reduced to 2.6 fs including GDD and\nSPM, which is about one optical cycle of 2.7 fs at a center wavelength of\n800nm. At that point all approximations, we have mode so far break down.\nIf the amount of negative dispersion is reduced too much, i.e. the pulses\nbecome to short, the absorber cannot keep them stable anymore.\nIf there is strong positive dispersion, the pulses again become stable and\nlong, but highly chirped. The pulse can then be compressed externally, how\never not completely to their transform limit, because these are nonlinearly\nchirped pulses, see Eq.(6.43).\nIn the case of strong solitonlike pulse shaping, the absorber doesn't have\nto be really fast, because the pulse is shaped by GDD and SPM and the\nabsorber has only to stabilize the soliton against the continuum. This regime\nhas been called Soliton mode locking.\n6.3\nSoliton Mode Locking\nIf strong soliton formation is present in the system, the saturable absorber\ndoesn't have to be fast [6][7][8], see Figure 6.7.

The continuum is a\nlong pulse exploiting the peak of the gain\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nThe continuum can be viewed as a long pulse competing with the soliton\nfor the available gain. In the frequency domain, see Figure 6.9, the soliton\nhas a broad spectrum compared to the continuum. Therefore, the continuum\nexperiences the peak of the gain, whereas the soliton spectrum on average\nexperiences less gain. This advantage in gain of the continuum has to be\ncompensated for in the time domain by the saturable absorber response, see\nFigure 6.8. Whereas for the soliton, there is a balance of the nonlinearity\nand the dispersion, this is not so for the continuum. Therefore, the contin\nuum is spread by the dispersion into the regions of high absorption. This\nmechanism has to clean up the gain window following the soliton and caused\nby the slow recovery of the absorber. As in the case of active modelocking,\nonce the soliton is too short, i.e. a too long net-gain window arises, the loss\nof the continuum may be lower than the loss of the soliton, see Figure 6.7\nand the continuum may break through and destroy the single pulse soliton\nsolution. As a rule of thumb the absorber recovery time can be about 10\ntimes longer than the soliton width. This modelocking principle is especially\nimportant for modelocking of lasers with semiconductor saturable absorbers,\nwhich show typical absorber recovery times that may range from 100fs-100\nps. Pulses as short as 13fs have been generated with semiconductor saturable\nabsorbers [11]. Figure 6.10 shows the measured spectra from a Ti:sapphire\nlaser modelocked with a saturable absorber for different values for the intra-\ncavity dispersion. Lowering the dispersion, increases the bandwidth of the\nsoliton and therefore its loss, while lowering at the same time the loss for the\ncontinuum. At some value of the dispersion the laser has to become unstabile\nby break through of the continuum. In the example shown, this occurs at\na dispersion value of about D = -500fs2 . The continuum break-through is\nclearly visible by the additional spectral components showing up at the cen\nter of the spectrum. Reducing the dispersion even further might lead again\nto more stable but complicated spectra related to the formation of higher\norder solitons. Note the spectra shown are time averaged spectra.\n\n6.3.

The details of the spectra and\nautocorrelation may strongly depend on the detailed absorber response.\n6.4\nDispersion Managed Soliton Formation\nThe nonlinear Schrodinger equation describes pulse propagation in a medium\nwith continuously distributed dispersion and self-phase-modulation. For\nlasers generating pulses as short as 10 fs and below, it was first pointed out by\nSpielmann et al. that large changes in the pulse occur within one roundtrip\nand that the ordering of the pulse-shaping elements within the cavity has a\nmajor effect on the pulse formation [9]. The discrete action of linear disper\nsion in the arms of the laser resonator and the discrete, but simultaneous,\naction of positive SPM and positive GDD in the laser crystal cannot any\nlonger be neglected. The importance of strong dispersion variations for the\nlaser dynamics was first discovered in a fiber laser and called stretched pulse\nmodelocking [11]. The positive dispersion in the Er-doped fiber section of a\nfiber ring laser was balanced by a negative dispersive passive fiber. The pulse\ncirculating in the ring was stretched and compressed by as much as a factor\nof 20 in one roundtrip. One consequence of this behavior was a dramatic\ndecrease of the nonlinearity and thus increased stability against the SPM\ninduced instabilities. The sidebands, due to periodic perturbations of the\nsoliton, as discussed in section 3.6, are no longer observed (see Fig. 6.12).\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nTamura, K., E.

DISPERSION MANAGED SOLITON FORMATION\nThe energy of the output pulses could be increased 100 fold. The mini\nmum pulsewidth was 63 fs, with a bandwdith much broader than the erbium\ngain bandwidth [12]. Figure 6.12 also shows the spectral enhancement of the\nfiber laser in the dispersion managed regime. The generation of ultrashort\npulses from solid state lasers like Ti:sapphire has progressed over the past\ndecade and led to the generation of pulses as short as 5 fs directly from the\nlaser. At such short pulse lengths the pulse is streched up to a factor of ten\nwhen propagating through the laser crystal creating a dispersion managed\nsoliton [10]. The spectra generated with these lasers are not of simple shape\nfor many reasons. Here, we want to consider the impact on the spectral\nshape and laser dynamcis due to dispersion managed soliton formation.\nAr-Ion-Laser\nDCM\nDCM\nM0\na\nDCM P1\nTi:Sa\nL\nP2\nb\nD+ΔD\n-\nD, SPM\nD-ΔD\n-\nLeft Arm\nLaser Crystal\nRight Arm\nFigure 6.13: (a) Schematic of a Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser:\nP's, prisms; L, lens; DCM's, double-chirped mirror; TiSa, Ti:sapphire.

PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nmedium (Ti:sapphire crystal) and dispersion balancing components (mirrors,\nprism pairs), see Fig. 6.13 a. The system can be decomposed into the res\nonator arms and the crystal, see Fig. 6.13 b. To achieve ultrashort pulses,\nthe dispersion-balancing components should produce near-zero net dispersion\nwhile the dispersion element(s) individually produce significant group delay\nover the broad bandwidth of the laser pulse. This fact suggests an analogy\nwith dispersion-managed pulse propagation along a dispersion-managed fiber\ntransmission link [14]. A system with sufficient variation of dispersion can\nsupport solitary waves. One can show that the Kerr nonlinearity produces\na self-consistent nonlinear scattering potential that permits formation of a\nperodic solution with a simple phase factor in a system with zero net dis\npersion. The pulses are analogous to solitons in that they are self-consistent\nsolutions of the Hamiltonian (lossless) problem as the conventional solitons\ndiscussed above. But they are not secant hyperbolic in shape. Figure 6.14\nshows a numerical simulation of a self-consistent solution of the Hamiltonian\npulse-propagation problem in a linear medium of negative dispersion and\nsubsequent propagation in a nonlinear medium of positive dispersion and\npositive self-phase modulation, following the equation\n∂A(z, t) = jD(z) ∂2\nA(z, t) - jδ(z)|A|2A(z, t)\n(6.65)\n∂z\n∂t2\nIn Fig. 6.15 the steady state intensity profiles are shown at the center of\nthe negative dispersion segment over 1000 roundtrips. It is clear that the solu\ntion repeats itself from period to period, i.e. there is a new solitary wave that\nsolves the piecewise nonlinear Schroedinger equation 6.65, dispersion man\naged soliton. In contrast to the conventional soliton the dispersion mangaged\nsoliton of equation 6.65 (with no SAM and no filtering) resemble Gaussian\npulses down to about -10 dB from the peak, but then show rather compli\ncated structure, see Fig. 6.15.The dispersion map D(z) used is shown as an\ninset in Figure 6.14. One can additionally include saturable gain, Lorentzian\ngain filtering, and a fast saturable absorber. Figure 6.14 shows the behavior\nin one period (one round trip through the resonator) including these effects.\nThe response of the absorber is q(A) = qo/(1 + |A|2/PA), with qo = 0.01/mm\nand PA = 1 MW. The bandwidth-limited gain is modeled by the Lorentzian\nprofile with gain bandwidth 2π×43 THz. The filtering and saturable absorp\ntion reduce the spectral and temporal side lobes of the Hamiltonian problem.\nAs can be inferred from Fig. 6.14, the steady state pulse formation can be\nunderstood in the following way. By symmetry the pulses are chirp free in\n\n6.4.

The negative segment has no\nnonlinearity.\nthe middle of the dispersion cells. A chirp free pulse starting in the center of\nthe gain crystal, i.e. nonlinear segment is spectrally broadened by the SPM\nand disperses in time due to the GVD, which generates a rather linear chirp\nover the pulse. After the pulse is leaving the crystal it experiences negative\nGVD during propagation through the left or right resonator arm, which is\ncompressing the positively chirped pulse to its transform limit at the end of\nthe arm, where an output coupler can be placed. Back propagation towards\nthe crystal imposes a negative chirp, generating the time reversed solution of\nthe nonliner Schrodinger equation (6.65). Therefore, subsequent propagation\nin the nonlinear crystal is compressing the pulse spectrally and temporally\nto its initial shape in the center of the crystal. The spectrum is narrower in\nthe crystal than in the negative-dispersion sections, because it is negatively\nprechirped before it enters the SPM section and spectral spreading occurs\nagain only after the pulse has been compressed. This result further explains\nthat in a laser with a linear cavity, for which the negative dispersion is lo\ncated in only one arm of the laser resonator (i.e. in the prism pair and no\nuse of chirped mirrors) the spectrum is widest in the arm that contains the\nnegative dispersion . In a laser with a linear cavity, for which the negative\ndispersion is equally distributed in both arms of the cavity, the pulse runs\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nthrough the dispersion map twice per roundtrip. The pulse is short at each\nend of the cavity and, most importantly, the pulses are identical in each pass\nthrough the crystal, which exploits the saturable absorber action (Kerr-Lens\nModelocking in this case, as will be discussed in the next chapter) twice\nper roundtrip, in contrast to an asymmetric dispersion distribution in the\nresonator arms. Thus a symmetric dispersion distribution leads to an effec\ntive saturable absorption that is twice as strong as an asymmetric dispersion\ndistribution resulting in substantially shorter pulses. Furthermore, the dis\npersion swing between the negative and positive dispersion sections is only\nhalf, which allows for shorter dispersion-managed solitons operating at the\nsame average power level.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nChen, Y., et al. \"Dispersion managed mode-locking.\" Journal of Optical Society of Americas B 16 (1999): 1999-2004.\nFigure 6.15: Simulation of the Hamiltonian problem.

DISPERSION MANAGED SOLITON FORMATION\nTo further illustrate the efficiency of the dispersion managed soliton for\nmation, we present a series of simulations that start with a linear segment\nof negative dispersion and a nonlinear segment of positive dispersion of the\nsame magnitude, saturable absorber action, and filtering.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nChen, Y., et al. \"Dispersion managed mode-locking.\" Journal of Optical Society of Americas B 16 (1999): 1999-2004.\nFigure 6.16: Sequence of pulse profiles in the center of the negatively dis\npersive segment for three magnitudes of SPM. to = 3 fs, with solid curves\n(5.5 fs) for δ = 1 (MW mm)-1 , dashed-dotted curve (7 fs) for δ = 0.5 (MW\nmm)-1 , and dashed cuves for no SPM of δ = 0. The dispersion map is of\nFig. 6.14. The output coupler loss is 3%.[10]\nThe dashed curve in Figure 6.16 shows the pulse shape for gain, loss,\nsaturable absorption and gain filtering only. We obtained the other traces\nby increasing the SPM while keeping the energy fixed through adjustment\nof the gain. As one can see, increasing the SPM permits shorter pulses.\nThe shortest pulse can be approximately three times shorter than the pulse\nwithout SPM. The parameters chosen for the simulations are listed in the\nfigure caption. In this respect, the behavior is similar to the fast saturable\nabsorber case with conventional soliton formation as discussed in the last\nsection.\nA major difference in the dispersion managed soliton case is illustrated in\nFig. 6.17. The figure shows the parameter ranges for a dispersion-managed\nsoliton system (no gain, no loss, no filtering) that is unbalanced such as to\nresult in the net dispersion that serves as the abscissa of the figure. Each\ncurve gives the locus of energy versus net cavity dispersion for a stretching\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nratio S = LD/τ 2\n(or pulse width with fixed crystal length L). One can\nFWHM\nsee that for pulse width longer than 8 fs with crystal length L = 2 mm,\nno solution of finite energy exists in the dispersion managed system for zero\nor positive net dispersion. Pulses of durations longer than 8 fs require net\nnegative dispersion. Hence one can reach the ultrashort dispersion managed\nsoliton operation at zero net dispersion only by first providing the system\nwith negative dispersion. At the same energy, one can form a shorter pulse\nby reducing the net dispersion, provided that the 8 fs threshold has been\npassed. For a fixed dispersion swing ±D, the stretching increases quadrat\nically with the spectral width or the inverse pulse width. Long pulses with\nno stretching have a sech shape. For stretching ratios of 3-10 the pulses are\nGaussian shaped. For even larger stretching ratios the pulse spectra become\nincreasingly more flat topped, as shown in Fig. 6.16.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nChen, Y., et al. \"Dispersion managed mode-locking.\" Journal of Optical Society of Americas B 16 (1999): 1999-2004.\nFigure 6.17: Energy of the pulse in the lossless dispersion-managed system\nwith stretching S = LD/τ 2\nor for a fixed crystal length L and pulsewidth\nFWHM\nas parameters; D = 60 fs2/mm for Ti:sapphire at 800 nm [10].\nTo gain insight into the laser dynamics and later on in their noise and\ntuning behavior, it is advantageous to formulate also a master equation ap\nproach for the dispersion managed soliton case [16]. Care has to be taken of\nthe fact that the Kerr-phase shift is produced by a pulse of varying amplitude\nand width as it circulates around the ring. The Kerr-phase shift for a pulse\n\n6.4. DISPERSION MANAGED SOLITON FORMATION\nof constant width, δ|a|2 had to be replaced by a phase profile that mimics\nthe average shape of the pulse, weighted by its intensity. Therefore, the SPM\naction is replaced by\nδ|A|2 = δo|Ao|2\nμ\n1 - μ t2 ¶\n(6.66)\nτ 2\nwhere Ao is the pulse amplitude at the position of minimum width. The\nKerr-phase profile is expanded to second order in t. The coefficient δo and\nμ are evaluated variationally. The saturable absorber action is similarly\nexpanded. Finally, the net intracavity dispersion acting on average on the\npulse is replaced by the effective dispersion Dnet in the resonator within one\nroundtrip. The master equation becomes\nA\n!\n∂\n∂2\nTR\nA =\n(g - l)A +\n+ jDnet\nA\n∂T\nΩ2\nf\n∂t2\n(6.67)\nμ\nt2 ¶\n+(γo - jδo)|Ao|2 1 - μτ 2\nA\nThis equation has Gaussian-pulse solutions. The master equation (6.67)\nis a patchwork, it is not an ordinary differential equation. The coefficients in\nthe equation depend on the pulse solution and eventually have to be found\niteratively. Nevertheless, the equation accounts for the pulse shaping in the\nsystem in an analytic fashion. It will allow us to extend the conventional\nsoliton perturbation theory to the case of dispersion managed solitons.\nThere is one more interesting property of the stretched pulse operation\nthat needs to be emphasized. Dispersion managed solitons may form even\nwhen the net dispersion as seen by a linearly propagating pulse is zero or\nslightly positive. This is a surprising result which was discovered in the\nstudy of dispersion managed soliton propagation [14]. It turns out that the\nstretched pulse changes its spectrum during propagation through the two\nsegments of fiber with opposite dispersion or in the case of a Ti:Sapphire\nlaser in the nonlinear crystal. The spectrum in the segment with normal\n(positive) dispersion is narrower, than in the segment of anomalous (nega\ntive) dispersion, see Figure 6.14. The pulse sees an effective net negative\ndispersion, provided that the positive Dnet is not too large. In (6.67) the\nDnet is to be replaced by Deff which can be computed variationally. Thus,\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\ndispersion managed soliton-like solutions can exist even when Dnet is zero.\nHowever, they exist only if the stretching factor is large, see Figure 6.17.\nA remarkable property of the dispersion managed solitons is that they do\nnot radiate (generate continuum) even though they propagate in a medium\nwith abrupt dispersion changes. This can be understood by the fact, that the\ndispersion mangaged soliton is a solution of the underlaying dynamics incor\nporating already the periodic dispersion variations including the Kerr-effect.\nThis is in contrast to the soliton in a continuously distributed dispersive en\nvironment, where periodic variations in dispersion and nonlinearity leads to\nradiation.\n\nBibliography\n[1] G.H.C.

One can use\nreal saturable absorbers, such as semiconductors or dyes and solid-state laser\nmedia. One can also exploit artificial saturable absorbers. The two most\nprominent artificial saturable absorber modelocking techniques are called\nKerr-Lens Mode Locking (KLM) and Additive Pulse Mode Locking (APM).\nAPM is sometimes also called Coupled-Cavity Mode Locking (CCM). KLM\nwas invented in the early 90's [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], but was already predicted\nto occur much earlier [8][9][10]·\n7.1\nKerr-Lens Mode Locking (KLM)\nThe general principle behind Kerr-Lens Mode Locking is sketched in Fig. 7.1.\nA pulse that builds up in a laser cavity containing a gain medium and a Kerr\nmedium experiences not only self-phase modulation but also self focussing,\nthat is nonlinear lensing of the laser beam, due to the nonlinear refractive in\ndex of the Kerr medium. A spatio-temporal laser pulse propagating through\nthe Kerr medium has a time dependent mode size as higher intensities ac\nquire stronger focussing. If a hard aperture is placed at the right position\nin the cavity, it strips of the wings of the pulse, leading to a shortening of\nthe pulse. Such combined mechanism has the same effect as a saturable ab\nsorber. If the electronic Kerr effect with response time of a few femtoseconds\nor less is used, a fast saturable absorber has been created. Instead of a sep\n\n258CHAPTER 7.

The hard aperture can be also\nreplaced by the soft aperture due to the spatial variation of the gain in the\nlaser crystal.\narate Kerr medium and a hard aperture, the gain medium can act both as a\nKerr medium and as a soft aperture (i.e. increased gain instead of saturable\nabsorption). The sensitivity of the laser mode size on additional nonlinear\nlensing is drastically enhanced if the cavity is operated close to the stability\nboundary of the cavity. Therefore, it is of prime importance to understand\nthe stability ranges of laser resonators. Laser resonators are best understood\nin terms of paraxial optics [11][12][14][13][15].\n7.1.1\nReview of Paraxial Optics and Laser Resonator\nDesign\nThe solutions to the paraxial wave equation, which keep their form during\npropagation, are the Hermite-Gaussian beams. Since we consider only the\nfundamental transverse modes, we are dealing with the Gaussian beam\n∙\nU(r, z) = Uo exp -jk\nr\n\n,\n(7.1)\nq(z)\n2q(z)\n\n7.1.

In free space propagation from z1 to z2, the variation of the beam\nparameter q is simply governed by\nq2 = q1 + z2 - z1,\n(7.4)\nwhere q2 and q1 are the beam parameters at z1 and z2. If the beam waist,\nat which the beam has a minimum spot size w0 and a planar wavefront\n(R = inf), is located at z = 0, the variations of the beam spot size and the\nradius of curvature are explicitly expressed as\n\"\nμ\n¶2 #1/2\nλz\nw(z) = wo 1 +\n,\n(7.5)\nπwo 2\nand\n\"\n#\nμ\n2 ¶2\nπwo\nR(z) = z 1 +\n.\n(7.6)\nλz\nThe angular divergence of the beam is inversely proportional to the beam\nwaist.

The resonator is stable if no ray escapes after many round-trips, which\nis the case when the eigenvalues of the matrix M are less than one. Since\nwe have a lossless resonator, i.e. det|M| = 1, the product of the eigenvalues\nhas to be 1 and, therefore, the stable resonator corresponds to the case of a\ncomplex conjugate pair of eigenvalues with a magnitude of 1.

The stabil\nity criterion can be easily interpreted geometrically.

The confocal parameter of the\nlaser mode is approximately equal to the stability range.\nAstigmatism Compensation\nSo far, we have considered the curved mirrors under normal incidence. In a\nreal cavity this is not the case and one has to analyze the cavity performance\nfor the tangential and sagittal beam separately. The gain medium, usually a\nthin plate with a refractive index n and a thickness t, generates astigmatism.\nAstigmatism means that the beam foci for sagittal and tangential plane are\nnot at the same position. Also, the stablity regions of the cavity are different\nfor the different planes and the output beam is elliptical. This is so, because\na beam entering a plate under an angle refracts differently in both planes, as\ndescribed by different ABCD matricies for tangential and sagittal plane, see\nTable 7.1.Fortunately, one can balance the astigmatism of the beam due to\n\n/\n/\n\ng , g\nS = g\nx g 2\nw 0 / ( λ (R' 1*R' 2 )\n/π )\nw 1 / ( λ R' 1/π )\n1/2\nw 2 / ( λ R' 2/π )\n1/2\nz 1 / L\nz 2 / L\n11.0\n10.8\n10.6\n10.4\n10.2\n10.0\n9.8\n9.6\nCavity Length, L / cm\n11.0\n10.8\n10.6\n10.4\n10.2\n10.0\n9.8\n9.6\nCavity Length, L / cm\n11.0\n10.8\n10.6\n10.4\n10.2\n10.0\n9.8\n9.6\nCavity Length, L / cm\n11.0\n10.8\n10.6\n10.4\n10.2\n10.0\n9.8\n9.6\nCavity Length, L / cm\n7.1.

KERR-LENS AND ADDITIVE PULSE MODE LOCKING\nThe Kerr lensing effect can be exploited in different ways to achieve mode\nlocking.\nSoft-Aperture KLM\nIn the case of soft-aperture KLM, the cavity is tuned in such a way that\nthe Kerr lensing effect leads to a shrinkage of the laser mode when mode-\nlocked. The non-saturated gain in a laser depends on the overlap of the pump\nmode and the laser mode. From the rate equations for the radial photon\ndistribution N(r) and the inversion NP (r) of a laser, which are proportional\nto the intensities of the pump beam and the laser beam, we obtain a gain,\nthat is proportional to the product of N(r) and NP (r).If we assume that the\nfocus of the laser mode and the pump mode are at the same position and\nneglect the variation of both beams as a function of distance, we obtain\nZ inf\ng ∼\nN(r) ∗ NP (r)rdr\nZ0\ninf\n∙\n\n∙\n\n2P P\n2r2\n2r2\n∼\nexp -\nexp -\nrdr\nπw\nw\nπw\nw\nP\nP\nL\nL\nWith the beam cross sections of the pump and the laser beam in the gain\nmedium, AP = πwP\n2 and AL = πwL\n2 ,we obtain\ng ∼\n.\nAP + AL\nIf the pump beam is much stronger focused in the gain medium than the laser\nbeam, a shrinkage of the laser mode cross section in the gain medium leads\nto an increased gain. When the laser operates in steady state, the change\nin saturated gain would have to be used for the investigation. However, the\ngeneral argument carries through even for this case. Figure 7.16 shows the\nvariation of the laser mode size in and close to the crystal in a soft-aperture\nKLM laser due to self-focusing.\n\n7.1.

Note, that depending on whether\nthe aperture is positioned in the long or short arm of the resontor, the operat\ning point of the cavity at which Kerr lensing favours or opposes mode-locking\nmay be quite different (see Figure 7.13).\nGaussian beam radius (μm)\nTangential Plane\nSagittal Plane\nP=1.5MW\nP=1.5MW\nP=0\nP=0\nPump Beam\nPump Beam\nxtal\nxtal\n\n280CHAPTER 7.

Figure 7.17 shows\nthe general principle at work. A small fraction of the light emitted from the\nmain laser cavity is injected externally into a nonlinear fiber. In the fiber\nstrong SPM occurs and introduces a significant phase shift between the peak\nand the wings of the pulse. In the case shown the phase shift is π\nA part of the modified and heavily distorted pulse is reinjected into the\ncavity in an interferometrically stable way, such that the injected pulse inter\nferes constructively with the next cavity pulse in the center and destructively\nin the wings. This superposition leads to a shorter intracavity pulse and the\npulse shaping generated by this process is identical to the one obtained from\na fast saturable absorber.

Carrier-trapping or\nrecombination [5].\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nThere is a coherent regime (I) with a duration of 10-50 fs depending on\nconditions and material. Then in phase (II), carrier-carrier scattering sets\nin and leads to destruction of coherence and thermalization of the electron\nand hole gas at a high temperature due to the excitation of the carriers high\nin the conduction or valence band. This usually happens on a 60 - 100 fs\ntime scale. On a 300fs - 1ps time scale, the hot carrier gas interacts with\nthe lattice mainly by emitting LO-phonons (37 meV in GaAs). The carrier\ngas cools down to lattice temperature. After the thermalization and cooling\nprocesses, the carriers are at the bottom of the conduction and valence band,\n\n8.1. CARRIER DYNAMICS AND SATURATION PROPERTIES\nrespectively. The carriers vanish (III) either by getting trapped in impurity\nstates, which can happen on a 100 fs - 100 ps time scale, or recombine over\nrecombination centers or by radiation on a nanosecond time-scale. Carrier-\nlifetimes in III-VI semiconductors can reach several tens of nanoseconds and\nin indirect semiconductors like silicon or germanium lifetimes can be in the\nmillisecond range.

Used with permission.\nThese high fluence effects lead to strong modifications of the saturation\ncharacteristics of a saturable absorber. The importance of the high fluence\neffects was first recognized in resonant absorbers (see Figure 8.10). The field\ninside the absorber is enhanced by adding a top reflector and a proper spacer\nlayer. This leads to an effective lower saturation fluence when viewed with\n\nCHAPTER 8. SEMICONDUCTOR SATURABLE ABSORBERS\nrespect to the intracavity fluence or intensity. Therefore, high fluenece effects\nare already reached at low intracavity intensities (see Figure 8.9).\nFigure 8.10: A top reflector is added to the semiconductor saturable absorber\nsuch that the field in the quantum well is resonantely enhanced by about a\nfactor of 10 in comparison to the non resonant case.\nTheon, E.

Used with permission.\nThe roll-over of the saturation characteristics has positive and negative\nconsequences for mode locking. First, if the roll-over can be reached with the\navailable intracavity pulse energy, Q-switching can be suppressed. Second if\nthe roll-over occurs too early, the pulses break up into multiple pulses to\noptimize the net gain for the overall pulse stream.\n8.3\nBreak-up into Multiple Pulses\nIn the treatment of mode locking with fast and slow saturable absorbers we\nonly concentrated on stability against energy fluctuations (Q-switched mode\nlocking) and against break through of cw-radiation or continuum. Another\noften observed instability is the break-up into multiple pulses. The existience\nof such a mechanism is obvious if soliton pulse shaping processes are present.\nIf we assume that the pulse is completely shaped by the solitonlike pulse\nshaping processes, the FWHM pulse width is given by\n4 |D2|\nτ FWHM = 1.76\n.\n(8.4)\nδW\n\nCHAPTER 8. SEMICONDUCTOR SATURABLE ABSORBERS\nwhere W denotes the pulse energy. D2 the negative disperison and δ the self-\nphase modulation coefficient. With increasing pulse energy, of course the\nabsorber becomes more strongly saturated, which leads to shorter pulses ac\ncording to the saturable absorber and the soliton formula. At a certain point,\nthe absorber will saturate and can not provide any further pulse stabiliza\ntion. However, the Kerr nonlinearity may not yet saturate and, therefore,\nthe soliton formula dictates an ever decreasing pulse width for increasing\npulse energy. Such a process continues, until either the continuum breaks\nthrough, because the soliton loss becomes larger than the continuum loss, or\nthe pulse breaks up into two pulses. The pulses will have reduced energy\nper pulse and each one will be longer and experiences a reduced loss due\nto the finite gain bandwidth. Due to the reduced pulse energy, each of the\npulses will suffer increased losses in the absorber, since it is not any longer\nas strongly saturated as before. However, once the absorber is already over\nsaturated by the single pulse solution, it will also be strongly saturated for\nthe double-pulse solution. The filter loss due to the finite gain bandwidth\nis heavily reduced for the double-pulse solution. As a result, the pulse will\nbreak up into double-pulses. To find the transition point where the break-up\ninto multiple pulses occurs, we write down the round-trip loss due to the gain\nand filter losses and the saturable absorber according to 6.35\nDf\nlm =\n+ qs(Wm),\n(8.5)\n3τ 2 m\nwhere, qs(Wm) is the saturation loss experienced by the pulse when it prop\nagates through the saturable absorber. This saturation loss is given by\n+inf\nZ\nqs(W ) =\nq(T, t)|As(t)|2dt.\n(8.6)\nW\n-inf\nThis expression can be easily evaluated for the case of a sech-shaped steady\nstate pulse in the fast saturable absorber model with\nq0\nEA\nqfast(t) =\n,\nwhere PA =\n.\n(8.7)\n|A(t)|2\n1 + PA\nτ A\nand the slow saturable absorber model, where the relaxation term can be\nneglected because of τ A A τ.\n∙\nZ t\n\nqslow(t) = q0 exp -\n|As(t0)|2dt0 .\n(8.8)\nEA\n-inf\n\n8.3. BREAK-UP INTO MULTIPLE PULSES\nFor the slow absorber 8.8 the absorber losses (8.6) can be evaluated indepen\ndent of pulse shape to be\nh\ni\n1 - exp - W\nqs.slow(W ) = q0\nEA .\n(8.9)\nW\nEA\nThus for a slow absorber the losses depend only on pulse energy. In contrast,\nfor a fast absorber, the pulse shape must be taken into account and, for a\nsech-shaped pulse, one obtaines [14]\ns\n∙r\n\nα\nW\nqs,fast(W ) = q0\ntanh-1\n, with α =\n,\n(8.10)\nα (1 + α)\n1 + α\n2PAτ\nand the pulse energy of one pulse of the multiple pulse solution. The energy\nis determined from the total gain loss balance\ng0\n= l + lm.\n(8.11)\n1 + mWm\nPLTR\nMost often, the saturable absorber losses are much smaller than the losses\ndue to the output coupler. In that case the total losses are fixed independent\nof the absorber saturation and the filter losses. Then the average power does\nnot depend on the number of pulses in the cavity. If this is the case, one\npulse of the double pulse solution has about half of the energy of the single\npulse solution, and, therefore, the width of the double pulse is twice as large\nas that of the single pulse according to (8.4). Then the filter and absorber\nlosses for the single and double pulse solution are given by\nDf\nl1 =\n+ qs(W1),\n(8.12)\n3τ 2\nDf\nW1\nl2 =\n+ qs(\n).\n(8.13)\n12τ 2\nThe single pulse solution is stable against break-up into double pulses as long\nas\nl1 ≤ l2\n(8.14)\nis fulfilled. This is the case, if the difference in the filter losses between the\nsingle and double pulse solution is smaller than the difference in the saturable\nabsorber losses\nDf\nW\n< ∆qs(W ) = qs(\n) - qs(W ).\n(8.15)\n4τ 2\n\nCHAPTER 8. SEMICONDUCTOR SATURABLE ABSORBERS\nFigure 8.12 shows the difference in the saturable absorption for a single\npulse and a double pulse solution as a function of the ratio between the\nsingle pulse peak power and saturation power for a fast absorber and as a\nfunction of the ratio between the single pulse energy and saturation energy\nfor a slow absorber. Thus, for both cases the optimum saturation ratio, at\nwhich the largest discrimination between single and double pulses occurs and,\ntherefore, the shortest pulse before break-up into multiple pulses occurs, is\nabout 3. Note, that to arrive at this absolute number, we assumed that the\namount of saturable absoption is neglegible in comparison with the other\nintracavity losses, so that the saturated gain level and the gain and filter\ndispersion are fixed.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nKartner, F.

Keller. \"Mode-Locking with Slow and Fast Saturable Absorbers-\nWhat's the Difference.\" Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics 4 (1998): 159.\nFigure 8.12: Difference in loss experienced by a sech-shaped pulse in a slow\n(- - -) and a fast (____) saturable absorber for a given pulse energy or peak\npower , respectively.\nAt this optimum operation point, the discrimination against multiple\nbreak-up of a fast absorber is about 50% larger than the value of the slow ab\nsorber. Since the minimum pulsewidth scales with the square root of ∆qs(W ),\nsee Eq. (8.15), the minimum pulsewidth of the slow absorber is only about\n22% longer than with an equally strong fast saturable absorber. Figure 8.12\nalso predicts that a laser modelocked by a fast saturable absorber is much\nmore stable against multiple pulse break-up than a slow saturable absorber if\nit is oversaturated . This is due to the fact that a fast saturable absorber sat\nurates with the peak power of the pulse in comparison with a slow saturable\nabsorber, which saturates with the pulse energy. When the pulse breaks up\ninto a pulse twice as long with half energy in each, the peak power of the\n\n8.3. BREAK-UP INTO MULTIPLE PULSES\nindividual pulses changes by a factor of four. Therefore, the discrimination\nbetween long and short pulses is larger in the case of a fast saturable ab\nsorber, especially for strong saturation. Note that Fig. 8.12 is based on the\nsimple saturation formulas for fast and slow saturable absorbers Eqs. (8.9)\nand (8.10). We compare these predictions with numerical simulations and\nexperimental observations made wiht a Nd:glass laser [15][16].\nThe Nd:glass laser described in ref. [15] was modelocked by a saturable\nabsorber which showed a fast recovery time of τ A = 200 fs, a modulation\ndepth of q0 = 0.005 and a saturation energy of EA = 17 nJ. The other laser\nparameters can be found in [16]. Without the solitonlike pulse formation\n(GDD and SPM is switched off), the laser is predicted to produce about\n200 fs short pulses with a single pulse per round-trip, very similar to what\nwas discussed in the fast saturable absorber mode locking in Chapter 6. The\ndynamics becomes very much different if the negative GDD and positive SPM\nare included in the simulation, (see Figure 8.13)\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nKartner, F.

When\nthe laser reaches the double-pulse regime the multipel pulses are in constant\nmotion with respect to each other. The resulting pulse train is not any longer\nstationary in any sense.\n\nCHAPTER 8.

The time-bandwidth product is only meaningful in the single\npulse regime, where it is shown. The pulses are almost transform limited\nsech-pulses. The pulse width in the multiple pulseing regime is only unique\nin the parameter region where multiple pulses of similar height and width\nare achieved. The pulses break up into multiple pulses when the absorber is\nabout three times saturated.\nThe pulse width follows nicely the soliton relation (8.4), (dash-dotted\nline). The pulses become shorter, by about a factor of 2.5, than without\nGDD and SPM before the pulse breaks up into longer double-pulses. The\npulse break-up into double-pulses occurs when the absorber is about two\ntimes saturated, close to the point where the shortest pulse can be expected\naccording to the discussion above. Figures 8.13 shows, that the break-up\npoint for the double pulses is also very close to the instability for continuum\nbreak-through. Indeed the first pulse train after break-up at a small signal\ngain of g0 = 0.09 shows the coexistance of a longer and a shorter pulse,\nwhich indicates continuum break-through. But the following five traces are\ndouble pulses of equal height and energy. For even stronger saturation of the\n\n8.3. BREAK-UP INTO MULTIPLE PULSES\nabsorber the double-pulses break-up into triple pulses and so on. Then the\ndynamics becomes even more complex. This behavior has been observed in\ndetail in a Nd:glass laser [15], (see Figure 8.15), as well as in Cr4+:YAG lasers\n[17]. The simulations just discussed match the parameters of the Nd:glass\nexperiments.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nKartner, F. X., J. A. d. Au, and U.

Dots mea\nsured values and solid line fits for a single and double-pulse solitonlike pulse\nstream.\nFigure 8.15 clearly shows the scaling of the observed pulse width according\nto the soliton formula until the pulses break up at a saturation ratio of about\n2. Notice, that the absorber recovery time of 200 fs is not much shorter than\nthe pulse width achieved. Nevertheless, the optimum saturation ratio is close\nto the expected one of about 3. The break-up into pure double and triple\npulses can be observed more clearly if the absorber recovery time is chosen to\nbe shorter, so that continuum break-through is avoided. Figure 8.16 shows\nthe final simulation results obtained after 20,000 round-trips in the cavity, if\nwe reduce the absorber recovery time from 200 fs to 100 fs, again for different\nsmall signal gain, e.g. intracavity power levels and pulse energies. Now, we\nobserve a clean break-up of the single-pulse solution into double-pulses and\nat even higher intracavity power levels the break-up into triple pulses without\ncontinuum generation in between. Note that the spacing between the pulses\nis very much different from what has been observed for the 200 fs response\ntime. This spacing will depend on the details of the absorber and may also\n\nCHAPTER 8.

Due to the recent interest\nin using modelocked lasers for frequency metrology and high-resolution laser\nspectroscopy as well as phase sensitive nonlinear optics the noise and tuning\nproperties of mode combs emitted by modelocked lasers is of much current\ninterest. Soliton-perturbation theory is well suited to successfully predict\nthe noise behavior of many solid-state and fiber laser systems [1] as well as\nchanges in group- and phase velocity in modelocked lasers due to intracavity\nnonlinear effects [5]. We start off by reconsidering the derivation of the mas\nter equation for describing the pulse shaping effects in a mode-locked laser.\nWe assume that in steady-state the laser generates at some position z (for\nexample at the point of the output coupler) inside the laser a sequence of\npulses with the envelope a(T = mTr, t). These envelopes are the solutions\nof the corresponding master equation, where the dynamics per roundtrip is\ndescribed on a slow time scale T = mTR. Then the pulse train emitted from\nthe laser including the carrier is\n+inf\nh\n\ni\nX\nj ωc (t-mTR+\n- 1\n2mL\nvg\nvp\nA(T, t) =\na(T = mTr, t)e\n.\n(9.1)\nm=-inf\nwith repetition rate fR = 1/TR and center frequency ωc. Both are in general\nsubject to slow drifts due to mirror vibrations, changes in intracavity pulse\nenergy that might be further converted into phase and group velocity changes.\nNote, the center frequency and repetition rate are only defined for times long\n\nCHAPTER 9. NOISE AND FREQUENCY CONTROL\ncompared to the roundtrip time in the laser. Usually, they only change on\na time scale three orders of magnitude longer than the expectation value of\nthe repetition rate.\n9.1\nThe Mode Comb\nLets suppose the pulse envelope, repetition rate, and center frequency do not\nchange any more. Then the corresponding time domain signal is sketched in\nFigure 9.1.\nFigure 9.1: Pulse train emitted from a noise free mode-locked laser. The\npulses can have chirp.

Since the system is autonomous, there is no retiming and\nrephasing in the free running system.\n\nCHAPTER 9. NOISE AND FREQUENCY CONTROL\n9.2\nNoise in Mode-locked Lasers\nWithin this framework the response of the laser to noise can be easily in\ncluded. The spontaneous emission noise due to the amplifying medium with\nsaturated gain gs and excess noise factor Θ leads to additive white noise in\nthe perturbed master equation (9.6) with Lpert = ξ(t, T), where ξ is a white\nGaussian noise source with autocorrelation function\nhξ(t0, T 0)ξ(t, T)i = TR\n2Pnδ(t - t0)δ(T - T 0)\n(9.18)\nwhere the spontaneous emission noise energy Pn · TR with\n2gs\n~ωc\nPn = Θ\n~ωc = Θ\n(9.19)\nTR\nτ p\nis added to the pulse within each roundtrip in the laser. τ p is the cavity decay\ntime or photon lifetime in the cavity. Note, that the noise is approximated\nby white noise, i.e. uncorrelated noise on both time scales t, T. The noise\nbetween different round-trips is certainly uncorrelated. However, white noise\non the fast time scale t, assumes a flat gain, which is an approximation.\nBy projecting out the equations of motion for the pulse parameters in the\npresence of this noise according to (9.8)--(9.13), we obtain the additional\nnoise sources which are driving the energy, center frequency, timing and\nphase fluctuations in the mode-locked laser\n∂ ∆w =\n- 1 ∆w + Sw(T),\n(9.20)\n∂T\nτ w\n∂\n2φo ∆w\n∆θ(T)\n=\n\n+ Sθ(T),\n(9.21)\n∂T\nTR wo\n∂ ∆p(T)\n=\n- 1 ∆p + Sp(T),\n(9.22)\n∂T\nτ p\n∂\n-2|D|\n∆t =\n∆p + St(T),\n(9.23)\n∂T\nTR\n\n9.2.

For sub-10 fs lasers, the spectra fill up\nthe full gain bandwidth and the KLM is rather strong, so that the ampli\ntude and center frequency relaxation times are on the order of 10-100 cavity\nroundtrips. In very short pulse Ti:sapphire lasers nonlinear phase shifts are\non the order of 1 rad per roundtrip. Then most of the fluctuations are due to\namplitude fluctuations converted into phase jitter. This contributions can in\ncrease the linewidth by a factor of 100-10000, which may bring the linewidth\nto the mHz and Hz level.\n9.2.2\nThe Microwave Spectrum\nNot only the optical spectrum is of interest als the spectrum of the photo\ndetected output of the laser is of intrest.

Here we discuss as\nan example the impact of the instantaneous Kerr effect on group and phase\nvelocity of a soliton like pulse.\n9.3\nGroup- and Phase Velocity of Solitons\nThe Kerr-effect leads to a change of phase velocity of the pulse, resulting in\nthe self-phase shift of the soliton, φo, per round-trip. A change in group ve\nlocity does not appear explicitly in the solution of the NLSE. Self-steepening\nwhich becomes important for ultrashort pulses leads to an additional term in\nthe NLSE and therefore to an additional term in the master equation (9.6)\nδ ∂\nLpert = -\n(|a(T, t)|2 a(T, t)).\n(9.76)\nωc ∂t\n\n9.3. GROUP- AND PHASE VELOCITY OF SOLITONS\nThe impact of this term is expected to be small of the order of 1/(ωoτ) and\ntherefore only important for few-cycle pulses. However, it turns out that this\nterm alters the phase and group velocity of the soliton like pulse as much\nas the nonlinear phase shift itself. We take his term into account in form of\na perturbation. This perturbation term is odd and real and therefore only\nleads to a timing shift, when substituted into Eq.(9.6).\n∂∆t(T)\n= - δ\n1⁄2Z\nμ ¶¶\n3⁄4\nμ\n+inf\n∂\nt\nf ∗\nsec h3\n(9.77)\nTR\nA Re\n(t)\ndt\nt\n∂T\nsst\nωc\n∂t\nτ\n-inf\nδ\n2φ0\n=\nA =\n.\n(9.78)\nωc\nωc\nThis timing shift or group delay per round-trip, together with the nonlin\near phase shift leads to a phase change between carrier and envelope per\nroundtrip given by\n\n= -\n∂\n1 δA2\n0 + δA0\n2 = 1 δA2\n0.\n∆φCE = -φ0 + ωo\n(9.79)\nTR\n∆t(T)\n∂T\nselfsteep\nThe compound effect of this phase delay per round-trip in the carrier versus\nenvelope leads to a carrier-envelope frequency\n∆φCE\nφ0\nfCE =\nfR =\nfR.\n(9.80)\n2π\n2π\nThe group delay also changes the optical cavity length of the laser and there\nfore alters the repetition rate according to\n\nfR\n-fR\n= -2φ0\n= -\nfCE,\n(9.81)\n∆fR =\n∆t(T)\nfR\nselfsteep\nωo\nm0\nwhere m0 is the mode number of the carrier wave.

NOISE AND FREQUENCY CONTROL\nas a function of intracavity pulse energy. Of course, one has to remember,\nthat this model is so far based on self-phase modulation and self-steepening\nas the cause of a power dependent carrier-envelope offset frequency. There\nmay be other mechanisms that cause a power dependent carrier envelope\noffset frequency. One such effect is the group delay caused by the laser gain\nmedium another one is the carrier-envelope change due to a change in carrier\nfrequency, which gives most likely a very strong additional dependence on\npump power. Nevertheless, the formula 9.82 can be used for the control of\nthe optical frequency comb of a femtosecond laser by controlling the cavity\nlength and the intracavity pulse energy, via the pump power.\n9.4\nFemtosecond Laser Frequency Combs\nNevertheless, the formula (9.82) can be used for the control of the optical\nfrequency comb of a femtosecond laser by controlling the cavity length and\nthe intracavity pulse energy, via the pump power. According to Fig. 9.2\nevery line of the optical comb determined by\nfm = fCE + mfR.\n(9.83)\nNote, if the femtosecond laser emits a spectrum covering more than one\noctave, then one can frequency double part of the comb at low frequencies\nand beat it with the corresponding high frequency part of the comb on a\nphoto detector, see Fig. 9.5 The result is a photodector beat signal that\nconsists of discrete lines at the beat frequencies\nfk = kfR ± fCE\n(9.84)\nThis method for determining the carrier-envelope offset frequency is called\nf-to-2f interferometry.The carrier-envelope offset frequency can be extracted\nwith filters and synchronized to a local oscillator or to a fraction of the\nrepetition rate of the laser, for example fR/4.\nFigure 9.6 shows the setup of an octave spanning 200 MHz Ti:sapphire\nlaser where the carrier envelope offset frequency fCE is locked to a local\noscillator at 36 MHz using the f-to-2f self-referencing method [6]\nThe spectral output of this laser is shown in Figure 9.7 The spectral com\nponents at 1140 are properly delayed in a chirped mirror delay line against\nthe spectral components at 570 nm.

The wavelengths 570 and 1140 nm\nused for self-referencing are indicated by two dashed lines.\nthe fundamental at 570 nm is projected into the same polarization via a po\nlarizing beam splitter. The signal is then filtered through a 10nm wide filter\nand detected with a photomultiplier tube (PMT). A typical signal from the\nPMT is shown in Figure 9.8.Phase locking is achieved by a phase-locked loop\n(PLL) by feeding the error signal from the digital phase detector to an AOM\nplaced in the pump beam (see Fig. 9.6) which modulates the pump power\nand thus changes the carrier-envelope frequency via Eq.(9.82). A bandpass\nfilter is used to select the carrier-envelope beat signal at 170 MHz. This\nsignal is amplified, divided by 16 in frequency, and compared with a refer\nence frequency fLO supplied by a signal generator (Agilent 33250A) using\na digital phase detector. The carrier-envelope beat signal is divided by 16\nto enhance the locking range of the PLL. The phase detector acts as a fre\nquency discriminator when the loop is open, the output is thus the difference\nfrequency between the carrier-envelope frequency and the designated locking\nfrequency. The output signal is amplified in the loop filter, which in our case\nis a proportional and integral controller, and fed back to the AOM, closing\nthe loop. The output of the phase detector is proportional to the remaining\njitter between the carrier-envelope phase evolution and the local oscillator\nreduced by the division ratio 16. The power spectral density (PSD) of the\ncarrier-envelope phase fluctuations are measured with a vector signal ana\nlyzer (VSA) at the output of the phase detector. After proper rescaling by\nthe division factor the phase error PSD is shown in Fig. 9.9. The measure\n\n9.4.

The\nPSD of the carrier-envelope phase fluctuations can be integrated to obtain\nthe total phase error.

We obtain an integrated carrier-envelope phase jitter of about 0.1\nradian over the measured frequency range. The major contribution to the\nphase noise comes from low frequency fluctuations <10 kHz. If in addition to\nthe carrier-envelope frequency also the repetition rate of the laser is locked to\na frequency standard, such as for example a Cesium clock, the femtosecond\nlaser frequency comb in the optical domain is completely determined with\nmicrowave precision and can be used for optical frequency measurements [6].\n\nCHAPTER 9.

Photo detectors with bandwidth of 100 GHz are\navailable. For shorter pulses usually some type of autocorrelation or cross-\ncorrelation in the optical domain using nonlinear optical effects has to be\nperformed, i.e. the pulse itself has to be used to measure its width, because\nthere are no other controllable events available on such short time scales.\n10.1\nIntensity Autocorrelation\nPulse duration measurements using second-harmonic intensity autocorrela\ntion is a standard method for pulse characterisation. Figure 10.1 shows the\nsetup for a background free intensity autocorrelation. The input pulse is split\nin two, and one of the pulses is delayed by τ. The two pulses are focussed\ninto a nonliner optical crystal in a non-colinear fashion. The nonlinear opti\ncal crystal is designed for efficient second harmonic generation over the full\nbandwidth of the pulse, i.e. it has a large second order nonlinear optical\nsuszeptibility and is phase matched for the specific wavelength range. We\ndo not consider the z--dependence of the electric field and phase--matching\neffects. To simplify notation, we omit normalization factors. The induced\nnonlinear polarization is expressed as a convolution of two interfering electric--\nfields E1(t), E2(t) with the nonlinear response function of the medium, the\n\nCHAPTER 10.

C. Diels [2], (Figure\n10.2 a).

Therefore, it was\nalways a wish to reconstruct uniquely the electrical field with respect to am\nplitude and phase from the measured data. In fact one can show rigorously,\nthat amplitude and phase of a pulse can be derived uniquely from the IAC\nand the measured spectrum up to a time reversal ambiguityn [1]. Further\nmore, it has been shown that a cross-correlation of the pulse with a replica\n\n10.3. FREQUENCY RESOLVED OPTICAL GATING (FROG)\nchirped in a known medium and the pulse spectrum is enough to reconstruct\nthe pulse [3]. Since the spectrum of the pulse is already given only the phase\nhas to be determined. If a certain phase is assumed, the electric field and\nthe measured cross-correlation or IAC can be computed. Minimization of\nthe error between the measured cross-correlation or IAC will give the de\nsired spectral phase. This procedure has been dubbed PICASO (Phase and\nIntenisty from Cross Correlation and Spectrum Only).\nNote, also instead of measuring the autocorrelation and interferometric\nautocorrelation with SHG one can also use two-photon absorption or higher\norder absorption in a semiconductor material (Laser or LED) [4].\nHowever today, the two widely used pulse chracterization techniques are\nFrequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) and Spectral Phase Interferom\netry for Direct Electric Field Reconstruction (SPIDER)\n\n10.3\nFrequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG)\nWe follow closely the bock of the FROG inventor Rich Trebino. In frequency\nresolved optical gating, the pulse to be characterized is gated by another\nultrashort pulse [5]. The gating is no simple linear sampling technique, but\nthe pulses are crossed in a medium with an instantaneous nonlinearity (χ(2)\nor χ(3)) in the same way as in an autocorrelation measurement (Figures 10.1\nand 10.10). The FROG--signal is a convolution of the unknown electric--field\nE(t) with the gating--field g(t) (often a copy of the unknown pulse itself).\nHowever, after the interaction of the pulse to be measured and the gate\npulse, the emitted nonlinear optical radiation is not put into a simple photo\ndetector, but is instead spectrally resolved detected. The general form of the\nfrequency--resolved intensity, or Spectrogram SF (τ, ω) is given by\nZ inf\n\nSF (τ, ω) ∝\nE(t) · g(t - τ)e -jω tdt .\n(10.26)\n-inf\n\nCHAPTER 10.

It\ntemporally resolves the slow components and spectrally the fast components.\n10.3.1\nPolarization Gate FROG\nFigure 10.13 shows the setup [6][7]. FROG is based on the generation of\na well defined gate pulse, eventually not yet known. This can be achieved\nby using the pulse to be measured and an ultrafast nonlinear interaction.\nFor example the electronic Kerr effect can be used to induce an ultrafast\npolarization modulation, that can gate the pulse with a copy of the same\npulse.\n\nCHAPTER 10.

So how do we\nget from the FROG trace to the pulse shape with respect to amplitude and\nphase? If there is such an algorithm, which produces solutions, the question\nof uniquness of this solution arises. To get insight into these issues, we realize,\nthat the FROG trace can be written as\nIFROG(τ, ω) ∝\n\nZ inf\nEsig(t, τ )e\n-inf\n-jω tdt\n\n(10.30)\nWriting the signal field as a Fourier transform in the time variable, i.e.\nZ inf\nEsig(t, τ) =\nEˆ sig(t, Ω)e -jΩ τ dΩ\n(10.31)\n-inf\n\nCHAPTER 10.

The in\nversion of Eq.(10.32) is known as the 2D-phase retrival problem. Fortunately\nalgorithms for this inversion exist [8] and it is known that the magnitude (or\nmagnitude square) of a 2D-Fourier transform (FT) essentially uniquely de\ntermines also its phase, if additional conditions, such as finite support or the\nrelationship (10.29) is given. Essentially unique means, that there are ambi\nguities but they are not dense in the function space of possible 2D-transforms,\ni.e. they have probability zero to occur.\nFurthermore, the unknown pulse E(t) can be easily obtained from the\nmodified signal field Eˆ sig(t, Ω) because\nZ inf\nEˆ sig(t, Ω)\n=\n\nEsig(t, τ )ejΩ τ dτ\n(10.33)\nZ-inf\ninf\n=\nE(t)g(t - τ)e -jΩ τ dτ\n(10.34)\n-inf\n-jΩ t\n= E(t)G ∗ (Ω)e\n(10.35)\nwith\nZ inf\nG(Ω) =\ng(τ)e -jΩ τ dτ .\n(10.36)\n-inf\nThus there is\nˆ\nE(t) ∝ Esig(t, 0).\n(10.37)\nThe only condition is that the gate function should be chosen such that\nG(Ω) 6= 0.

SPECTRAL INTERFEROMETRY AND SPIDER\n10.4\nSpectral Interferometry and SPIDER\nSpectral Phase Interferometry for Direct Electric--Field Reconstruction (SPI\nDER) avoids iterative reconstruction of the phase profile. Iterative Fourier\ntransform algorithms do have the disadvantage of sometimes being rather\ntime consuming, preventing real--time pulse characterization. In addition,\nfor \"pathological\" pulse forms, reconstruction is difficult or even impossible.\nIt is mathematically not proven that the retrieval algorithms are unambigu\nous especially in the presence of noise.\nSpectral shearing interferometry provides an elegant method to overcome\nthese disadvantages. This technique has been first introduced by C. Iaconis\nand I.A. Walmsley in 1999 [11] and called spectral phase interferometry for\ndirect electric--field reconstruction -- SPIDER. Before we discuss SPIDER lets\nlook at spectral interferometry in general\n10.4.1\nSpectral Interferometry\nThe spectrum of a pulse can easily be measured with a spectrometer. The\npulse would be completely know, if we could determine the phase across\nthe spectrum. To determine this unknown phase spectral interferometry for\npulse measurement has been proposed early on by Froehly and others [12].\nIf we would have a well referenced pulse with field ER(t), superimpose the\nunknown electric field ES(t) delayed with the reference pulse and interfere\nthem in a spectrometer, see Figure 10.21, we obtain for the spectrometer\noutput\nt - τ)\n(10.42)\nZ\n\nt)\n=\nER(\n-inf\nˆ\nˆ(-)(\njωτ\nˆ(+)(\n-jωτ\n=\nSDC(ω) + S\nω)e\n+ S\nω)e\n(10.44)\nwith\nSˆ(+)(ω)\n=\nEˆ R\n∗ (ω)Eˆ S(ω)\n(10.45)\nˆ(-)(\nS(+)∗ (\nS\nω)\n=\nˆ\nω)\n(10.46)\nWhere (+) and (-) indicate as before, well separted positive and negative\n\"frequency\" signals, where \"frequency\" is now related to τ rather than ω.\nEI(\nt) + ES(\n\n+inf\nˆS(\n-jωtdt\ne\nˆ\nˆ\nER(\nES(\n-jωτ\nω)\n(10.43)\nω)\n=\n\nEI(t)\nω) +\n=\n\nCHAPTER 10.

C.\nIaconis and I.A. Walmsley [?] came up with the idea of generating two up\nconverted spectra slightly shifted in frequency and to investigate the spectral\ninterference of these two copies, see Figure 10.23. We use\njωS t\nER(t)\n=\nE(t)e\n(10.49)\nj(ωS +Ω)t\nES(t)\n=\nE(t - τ)e\n(10.50)\nEI(t)\n=\nER(t) + ES(t)\n(10.51)\nwhere ωs and ωs + Ω are the two frequencies used for upconversion and Ω\nis called the spectral shear between the two pulses.

It is obvious that the spectral shear Ω has to be small\ncompared to the spectral bandwdith ∆ω of the pulse, see Fig. 10.23. Then\nthe phase difference in Eq.(10.56) is proportional to the group delay in the\npulse, i.e.\n-Ω dφ = ψ(ω),\n(10.57)\ndω\nor\nZ ω\nφ(ω) = - 1\nψ(ω0)dω0 .\n(10.58)\nΩ\nNote, an error ∆τ in the calibration of the time delay τ results in an error\nin the chirp of the pulse\nω2\n∆φ(ω) = -\n∆τ.\n(10.59)\n2Ω\nThus it is important to chose a spectral shear Ω that is not too small. How\nsmall does it need to be? We essentially sample the phase with a sample\nspacing Ω. The Nyquist theorem states that we can uniquely resolve a pulse\nin the time domain if it is only nonzero over a length [-T, T ], where T = π/Ω.\nOn the other side the shear Ω has to be large enough so that the fringes in\nthe spectrum can be resolved with the available spectrometer.\n\n10.4. SPECTRAL INTERFEROMETRY AND SPIDER\nSPIDER Setup\nWe follow the work of Gallmann et al. [?] that can be used for characteri\nzation of pulses only a few optical cycles in duration. The setup is shown in\nFigure 10.24.\nFigure 10.24:\nSPIDER setup; SF10:\n65 mm glass block (GDD/z ≈\n160 fs2/ mm), BS: metallic beam splitters (≈ 200 μm, Cr--Ni coating 100 nm),\nτ: adjustable delay between the unchirped replica, τ SHG: delay between\nunchirped pulses and strongly chirp pulse, RO: reflective objective (Ealing--\nCoherent, x35, NA=0.5, f=5.4 mm), TO: refractive objective , L: lens, spec\ntrometer: Lot-Oriel MS260i, grating: 400 l/mm, Blaze--angle 350 nm, CCD:\nAndor DU420 CCI 010, 1024 x 255 pixels, 26 μm/pixel [13].\nCourtesy of Richard Ell. Used with permission.\nGeneration of two replica without additional chirp:\nA Michelson--type interferometer generates two unchirped replicas. The\nbeam--splitters BS have to be broadband, not to distort the pulses. The\ndelay τ between the two replica has to be properly chosen, i.e. in the setup\nshown it was about 400-500 fs corresponding to 120-150 μm distance in space.\n\nCHAPTER 10. PULSE CHARACTERIZATION\nSpectral shearing:\nThe spectrally sheared copies of the pulse are generated by sum-frequency\ngeneration (SFG) with quasi-monochromatic beams at frequencies ωs and\nωs + Ω. These quasi monochromatic signals are generated by strong chirp\ning of a third replica (cf. Fig. 10.24) of the signal pulse that propagates\nthrough a strongly dispersive glass slab. For the current setup we estimate\nfor the broadening of a Gaussian pulse due to the glass dispersion from 5 fs\nto approximately 6 ps. Such a stretching of more than a factor of thou\nsand assures that SFG occurs within an optical bandwidth less than 1 nm, a\nquasi--monochromatic signal. Adjustment of the temporal overlap τ SHG with\nthe two unchirped replica is possible by a second delay line. The streched\npulse can be computed by propagation of the signal pulse E(t) through the\nstrongly dispersive medium with transfer characteristic\n-jDglass(ω-ωc)2/2\nHglass(ω) = e\n(10.60)\nneglecting linear group delay and higher order dispersion terms.

SPECTRAL INTERFEROMETRY AND SPIDER\nSFG:\nA BBO crystal (wedged 10--50 μm) is used for type I phase--matched SFG.\nType II phase--matching would allow for higher acceptance bandwidths. The\npulses are focused into the BBO--crystal by a reflective objective composed of\ncurved mirrors. The signal is collimated by another objective. Due to SFG\nwith the chirped pulse the spectral shear is related to the delay between both\npulses, τ, determined by Eq.(10.64) to be\nΩ = -τ/Dglass.\n(10.66)\nNote, that conditions (10.65) and (10.66) are consistent with the fact that\nthe delay between the two pulses should be much larger than the pulse width\nτ p which also enables the separation of the spectra in Fig.10.22 to determine\nthe spectral phase using the Fourier transform method. For characterization\nof sub-10fs pulses a crystal thickness around 30 μm is a good compromise.\nEfficiency is still high enough for common cooled CCD--cameras, dispersion\nis already sufficiently low and the phase matching bandwidth large enough.\nSignal detection and phase reconstruction:\nAn additional lens focuses the SPIDER signal into a spectrometer with a\nCCD camera at the exit plane. Data registration and analysis is performed\nwith a computer. The initial search for a SPIDER signal is performed by\nchopping and Lock--In detection.The chopper wheel is placed in a way that\nthe unchirped pulses are modulated by the external part of the wheel and the\nchirped pulse by the inner part of the wheel. Outer and inner part have dif\nferent slit frequencies. A SPIDER signal is then modulated by the difference\n(and sum) frequency which is discriminated by the Lock--In amplifier. Once\na signal is measured, further optimization can be obtained by improving the\nspatial and temporal overlap of the beams in the BBO--crystal.\nOne of the advantages of SPIDER is that only the missing phase informa\ntion is extracted from the measured data. Due to the limited phase--matching\nbandwidth of the nonlinear crystal and the spectral response of grating and\nCCD, the fundamental spectrum is not imaged in its original form but rather\nwith reduced intensity in the spectral wings. But as long as the interference\nfringes are visible any damping in the spectral wings and deformation of\nthe spectrum does not impact the phase reconstruction process the SPIDER\n\nCHAPTER 10.

(10.72)\nThus up to an additional constant it delivers the group delay within the pulse\nto be characterized. A constant group delay is of no physical significance.\nSPIDER--Calibration\nThis is the most critical part of the SPIDER measurement. There are three\nquantities to be determined with high accuracy and reproducibility:\n- delay τ\n- shift ωs\n- shear Ω\nDelay τ:\nThe delay τ is the temporal shift between the unchirped pulses. It appears\nas a frequency dependent phase term in the SPIDER phase, Eqs. (10.56)\nand leads to an error in the pulse chirp if not properly substracted out, see\nEq.(10.59).\nA determination of τ should preferentially be done with the pulses de\ntected by the spectrometer but without the spectral shear so that the ob\nserved fringes are all exactly spaced by 1/τ . Such an interferogram may\n\n10.4. SPECTRAL INTERFEROMETRY AND SPIDER\nbe obtained by blocking the chirped pulse and overlapping of the individual\nSHG signals from the two unchirped pulses. A Fourier transform of the inter\nferogram delivers the desired delay τ.In practice, this technique might be dif\nficult to use. Experiment and simulation show that already minor changes of\nτ (±1 fs) significantly alter the reconstructed pulse duration (≈ ± 1 - 10%).\nAnother way for determination of τ is the following. As already men\ntioned, τ is accessible by a differentiation of the SPIDER phase with respect\nto ω. The delay τ therefore represents a constant GDD. An improper de\ntermination of τ is thus equivalent to a false GDD measurement. The real\nphysical GDD of the pulse can be minimized by a simultaneous IAC mea\nsurement. Maximum signal level, respectively shortest IAC trace means an\naverage GDD of zero. The pulse duration is then only limited by higher\norder dispersion not depending on τ. After the IAC measurement, the delay\nτ is chosen such that the SPIDER measurement provides the shortest pulse\nduration. This is justified because through the IAC we know that the pulse\nduration is only limited by higher order dispersion and not by the GDD ∝ τ.\nThe disadvantage of this method is that an additional IAC setup is needed.\nShift ωs:\nThe SFG process shifts the original spectrum by a frequency ωs ≈ 300 THz\ntowards higher frequencies equivalent to about 450 nm when Ti:sapphire\npulses are characterized. If the SPIDER setup is well adjusted, the square of\nthe SPIDER interferogram measured by the CCD is similar to the fundamen\ntal spectrum. A determination of the shift can be done by correlating both\nspectra with each other. Determination of ωs only influences the frequency\ntoo which we assign a give phase value, which is not as critical.\nShear Ω:\nThe spectral shear is uncritical and can be estimated by the glass dispersion\nand the delay τ.\n10.4.3\nCharacterization of Sub-Two-Cycle Ti:sapphire\nLaser Pulses\nThe setup and the data registration and processing can be optimized such\nthat the SPIDER interferogram and the reconstructed phase, GDD and in\ntensity envelope are displayed on a screen with update rates in the range of\n0.5-1s.\nReal--time SPIDER measurements enabled the optimization of external\n\nCHAPTER 10.

ULTRAFAST MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES\nbeam is chopped. Typical chopper frequencies of regular mechanical chop\npers are fch = 100Hz - 2kHz . Mechanical choppers up to 20kHz have been\nbuilt. With acousto-optic modulators or electro-optic modulators chopper\nfreuqencies up to several hundred MHz are possible.\nLets denote Sin = S0 + δS as the probe pulse energy, where S0 is the\naverage value and δs a low frequency noise of the pulse source and S(t)\nis the probe signal transmitted through the test device. Then the detected\nsignal transmitted through the test device can be written as\nS(t)\n=\nT(P(t))Sin\n(11.1)\ndT\n= T0Sin +\n(P0m(t))\ndP\nwhere T0 is the transmission without pump pulse, P0 is the pump pulse energy\nand m(t) the chopper modulation function. It is obvious that if the noise of\nthe probe laser δS is of low freuqency, then the signal can be shifted away\nfrom this noise floor by chosing an appropriately large chopper frequency in\nm(t). Ideally, the chopper frequency is chosen large enough to enable shot\nnoise limited detection.\nSometimes the test devices or samples have a rough surface and pump\nlight scattered from the surface might hit the detector. This can be partially\nsuppressed by orthogonal pump and probe polarization\nThis is a standard technique to understand relaxation dynamics in con\ndensed matter, such as carrier relaxation processes in semiconductors for\nexample.\n11.1.2\nColinear Pump-Probe Measurement:\nSometimes pump and probe pulses have to be collinear, for example when\npump probe measurements of waveguide devices have to be performed. Then\npump and probe pulse, which might both be at the same center wavelength\nhave to be made separable. This can be achieved by using orthogonal pump\nand probe polarization as shown in Figure 11.2 or by chopping pump and\nprobe at different frequencies and detecting at the difference frequency, see\nFigure 11.3.\n\n11.1.

ULTRAFAST MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES\n11.1.3\nHeterodyne Pump Probe\nThe lock-in detection is greatly improved if the difference frequency at which\nthe detection occurs can be chosen higher and the signal can be filtered much\nbetter using a heterodyne receiver. This is shown in Figure 11.4, where\nAOM's are used to prepare a probe and reference pulse shiftet by 39 and 40\nMHz respectively. The pump beam is chopped at 1kHz. After the test device\nthe probe and reference pulse are overlayed with each other by delaying the\nreference pulse in a Michelson-Interferometer.

Its is based on polarization rotation of a short laser pulse\nwhen propagating in a medium showing a linear electro-optic effect. The\npolarization rotation is due to an applied electric filed, i.e. the optical pulse\nsamples the instantaneous electric field, see Fig.11.6\nExternal Electro-Optic Sampling Scheme\nProbe beam in\n(arrive at delayed times\nSwitch Bias\nSemiconductor Substrate\nElectro-Optic\nProbe Crystal\nProbe\nBeam Out\nExcitation pulses\n(arrive at time t)\nof t+n.Δt)\nFigure 11.6: Electro-optic sampling scheme according ot J.

ULTRAFAST MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES\n11.4\nFour-Wave Mixing\nA more advanced ultrafast spectroscopy technique than pump-probe is four-\nwave mixing (FWM). It enables to investigate not only energy relaxation\nprocesses, as is the case in pump-probe measurements, but also dephasing\nprocesses in homogenous as well as inhomogenously broadened materials.\nThe typical set-up is shown in Fig. 11.12\nt12\nt\nSample\nPulse 1\nPulse 3\nPulse 2\nk1\nk2\nk3\nk1\nk2\nk3 (\n)\n+\n-\n\nDetector\nFigure 11.12: Typical Four-Wave-Mixing (FWM) beam geometry.\nLets assume these pulses interact resonantely with a two-level system\nmodelled by the Bloch Equations derived in chapter 2 (2.1592.162).\nμ\n¶\n∆ - 1\n∂2\nE (+)(z, t)\n=\nμ0\n∂2\nP (+)(z, t),\n(11.2)\nc0 ∂t2\n∂t2\nP (+)(\n\nz, t)\n=\n-2NM ∗ d(z, t)\n(11.3)\nE(+)\nd (z, t)\n=\n-(\n- jωeg)d +\nM\nw,\n(11.4)\nT2\n2j~\nw - w0\nE(+)d ∗ )\nw (z, t)\n=\n-\n+\n(M ∗ E (-)d - M\n(11.5)\nT1\nj~\nThe two-level system, located at z = 0, will be in the ground state, i.e.\nd(t = 0) = 0 and w(t = 0) = -1, before arrival of the first pulses.

BLOCH EQUATIONS\n2.3\nBloch Equations\nAtoms in low concentration show line spectra as found in gas-, dye- and some\nsolid-state laser media. Usually, there are infinitely many energy eigenstates\nin an atomic, molecular or solid-state medium and the spectral lines are\nassociated with allowed transitions between two of these energy eigenstates.\nFor many physical considerations it is already sufficient to take only two of\nthe possible energy eigenstates into account, for example those which are\nrelated to the laser transition. The pumping of the laser can be described\nby phenomenological relaxation processes into the upper laser level and out\nof the lower laser level. The resulting simple model is often called a two-\nlevel atom, which is mathematically also equivalent to a spin 1/2 particle\nin an external magnetic field, because the spin can only be parallel or anti-\nparallel to the field, i.e. it has two energy levels and energy eigenstates. The\ninteraction of the two-level atom or the spin with the electric or magnetic\nfield is described by the Bloch equations.\n2.3.1\nThe Two-Level Model\nAn atom having only two energy eigenvalues is described by a two-dimensional\nstate space spanned by the two energy eigenstates |e > and |g >. The two\nstates constitute a complete orthonormal system. The corresponding energy\neigenvalues are Ee and Eg (Fig. 2.2).\nFigure 2.2: Two-level atom\nIn the position-, i.e. x-representation, these states correspond to the wave\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nfunctions\nψe(x) =< x|e >,\nand\nψg(x) =< x|g > .\n(2.38)\nThe Hamiltonian of the atom is given by\nHA = Ee|e >< e| + Eg|g >< g|.\n(2.39)\nIn this two-dimensional state space only 2×2 = 4 linearly independent linear\noperators are possible. A possible choice for an operator base in this space is\n=\n|e >< e| + |g >< g|,\n(2.40)\nσz\n=\n|e >< e| -|g >< g|,\n(2.41)\nσ+\n=\n|e >< g|,\n(2.42)\nσ-\n=\n|g >< e|.\n(2.43)\nThe non-Hermitian operators σ± could be replaced by the Hermitian oper-\nators σx,y\nσx\n=\nσ+ + σ-,\n(2.44)\nσy\n=\n-jσ+ + jσ-.\n(2.45)\nThe physical meaning of these operators becomes obvious, if we look at the\naction when applied to an arbitrary state\n|ψ >= cg|g > + ce|e > .\n(2.46)\nWe obtain\nσ+|ψ\n>\n= cg|e >,\n(2.47)\nσ-|ψ\n>\n= ce|g >,\n(2.48)\nσz|ψ\n>\n= ce|e > -cg|g > .\n(2.49)\nThe operator σ+ generates a transition from the ground to the excited state,\nand σ-does the opposite. In contrast to σ+ and σ-, σz is a Hermitian\noperator, and its expectation value is an observable physical quantity with\nexpectation value\n< ψ|σz|ψ >= |ce|2 -|cg|2 = w,\n(2.50)\nthe inversion w of the atom, since |ce|2 and |cg|2 are the probabilities for\nfinding the atom in state |e > or |g > upon a corresponding measurement.\n\n2.3. BLOCH EQUATIONS\nIf we consider an ensemble of N atoms the total inversion would be σ =\nN < ψ|σz|ψ >. If we separate from the Hamiltonian (2.38) the term (Ee +\nEg)/2 ·1, where 1 denotes the unity matrix, we rescale the energy values\ncorrespondingly and obtain for the Hamiltonian of the two-level system\nHA = 1\n2~ωegσz,\n(2.51)\nwith the transition frequency\nωeg = 1\n~(Ee -Eg).\n(2.52)\nThis form of the Hamiltonian is favorable. There are the following commu-\ntator relations between operators (2.41) to (2.43)\n[σ+, σ-]\n=\nσz,\n(2.53)\n[σ+, σz]\n=\n-2σ+,\n(2.54)\n[σ-, σz]\n=\n2σ-,\n(2.55)\nand anti-commutator relations, respectively\n[σ+, σ-]+\n=\n1,\n(2.56)\n[σ+, σz]+\n=\n0,\n(2.57)\n[σ-, σz]+\n=\n0,\n(2.58)\n[σ-, σ-]+\n=\n[σ+, σ+]+ = 0.\n(2.59)\nThe operators σx, σy, σz fulfill the angular momentum commutator relations\n[σx, σy]\n=\n2jσz,\n(2.60)\n[σy, σz]\n=\n2jσx,\n(2.61)\n[σz, σx]\n=\n2jσy.\n(2.62)\nThe two-dimensional state space can be represented as vectors in C2 accord-\ning to the rule:\n|ψ >= ce|e > + cg|g >\n→\nμ ce\ncg\n¶\n.\n(2.63)\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nThe operators are then represented by matrices\nσ+\n→\nμ 0\n¶\n,\n(2.64)\nσ-\n→\nμ 0\n¶\n,\n(2.65)\nσz\n→\nμ 1\n-1\n¶\n,\n(2.66)\n→\nμ 1\n¶\n.\n(2.67)\n2.3.2\nThe Atom-Field Interaction In Dipole Approxi-\nmation\nThe dipole moment of an atom p is essentially determined by the position\noperator x via\np = -e0 x.\n(2.68)\nThen the expectation value for the dipole moment of an atom in state (2.46)\nis\n< ψ|p|ψ >\n=\n-e0(|ce|2 < e|x|e > +cec∗\ng < g|x|e >\n(2.69)\n+\ncgc∗\ne < e|x|g > +|cg|2 < g|x|g >).\nFor simplicity, we may assume that that the medium is an atomic gas. The\natoms posses inversion symmetry, therefore, energy eigenstates must be sym-\nmetric or anti-symmetric, i.e. < e|x|e >=< g|x|g >= 0. We obtain\n< ψ|p|ψ >= -e0 (cec∗\ng < g|x|e > +cgc∗\ne < g|x|e >∗).\n(2.70)\n(Note, this means, there is no permanent dipole moment in an atom, which\nis in an energy eigenstate. Note, this might not be the case in a solid. The\natoms consituting the solid are oriented in a lattice, which may break the\nsymmetry. If so, there are permanent dipole moments and consequently the\nmatrix elements < e|x|e > and < g|x|g > would not vanish. If so, there\nare also crystal fields, which then imply level shifts, via the linear Stark\neffect.) Thus an atom does only exhibit a dipole moment in the average, if\nthe product cec∗\ng 6= 0, i.e. the state of the atom is in a superposition of states\n|e > and |g >.\n\n2.3. BLOCH EQUATIONS\nWith the dipole matrix elements\nM = e0 < g|x|e >\n(2.71)\nthe expectation value for the dipole moment can be written as\n< ψ|p|ψ >= -(cec∗\ng M + cgc∗\ne M∗) = -< ψ|(σ+ M∗+ σ-M)|ψ > .\n(2.72)\nSince this is true for an arbitrary state, the dipole operator (2.68) is repre-\nsented by\np = p+ + p-= -M∗σ+ -Mσ-.\n(2.73)\nTherefore, the operators σ+ and σ-are proportional to the complex dipole\nmoment operators p+ and p-, respectively.\nThe energy of an electric dipole in an electric field is\nHA-F = -p · E(xA, t).\n(2.74)\nThe electric field at the position of the atom, xA, can be written as\nE(xA, t) = 1\nE(t)(+) + E(t)(-)\n= 1\n3 ˆE(t)(+)ejωt + ˆE(t)(-)e-jωt\n, (2.75)\nwhere ˆE(t)(+) denotes the slowly varying complex field envelope with ω ≈\nωeg. In the Rotating-Wave Approximation (RWA), we only keep the slowly\nvarying components in the interaction Hamiltonian. As we will see later, if\nthere is no field the operator σ+ evolves like σ+(t) = σ+(0)ejωegt, thus we\nobtain in RWA\nHA-F\n=\n-p · E(xA, t) ≈\n(2.76)\n≈\nHRWA\nA-F = 1\nM∗E(t)(-)σ+ + h.c..\n(2.77)\nThe Schrodinger Equation for the two-level atom in a classical field is then\ngiven by\nj~ d\ndt|ψ\n>\n= (HA + HA-F)|ψ >\n(2.78)\n≈\n(HA + HRWA\nA-F )|ψ > .\n(2.79)\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nWritten in the energy representation, we obtain\nd\ndtce\n=\n-jωeg\n2 ce -jΩre-jωtcg,\n(2.80)\nd\ndtcg\n=\n+jωeg\n2 cg -jΩre+jωtce,\n(2.81)\nwith the Rabi-frequency defined as\nΩr =\nM∗ˆE\n2~ .\n(2.82)\nFor the time being, we assume that the the Rabi-frequency is real. If this is\nnot the case, a transformation including a phase shift in the amplitudes ca,b\nwould be necessary to eliminate this phase. As expected the field couples the\nenergy eigenstates.\n2.3.3\nRabi-Oscillations\nIf the incident light has a constant field amplitude ˆE Eqs. (2.80) and (2.81)\ncan be solved and we observe an oscillation in the population difference, the\nRabi-oscillation [1]. To show this we introduce the detuning between field\nand atomic resonance\n∆= ωab -ω\n(2.83)\nand the new probability amplitudes\nCe\n=\nceej ω\n2 t,\n(2.84)\nCg\n=\ncge-j ω\n2 t.\n(2.85)\nThis leads to the new system of equations with constant coefficients\nd\ndtCe\n=\n-j∆Ce -jΩrCg,\n(2.86)\nd\ndtCg\n=\n+j∆Cg -jΩrCe.\n(2.87)\nNote, these are coupling of mode equations in time. Now, the modes are\nelectronic ones instead of photonic modes. But otherwise everything is the\n\n2.3. BLOCH EQUATIONS\nsame. For the case of vanishing detuning it is especially easy to eliminate\none of the variables and we arrive at\nd2\ndt2Ce\n=\n-Ω2\nrCe\n(2.88)\nd2\ndt2Cg\n=\n-Ω2\nrCg.\n(2.89)\nThe solution to this set of equations are the oscillations we are looking for. If\nthe atom is at time t = 0 in the ground-state, i.e. Cg(0) = 1 and Ce(0) = 0,\nrespectively, we arrive at\nCg(t)\n=\ncos (Ωrt)\n(2.90)\nCe(t)\n=\n-j sin (Ωrt) .\n(2.91)\nThen, the probabilities for finding the atom in the ground or excited state\nare\n|cb(t)|2\n=\ncos2 (Ωrt)\n(2.92)\n|ca(t)|2\n=\nsin2 (Ωrt) ,\n(2.93)\nas shown in Fig. 2.3. For the expectation value of the dipole operator under\nthe assumption of a real dipole matrix element M = M∗we obtain\n< p >\n=\n-Mcec∗\ng + c.c.\n(2.94)\n=\n-M sin (2Ωrt) sin (ωegt) .\n(2.95)\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nFigure 2.3: Evolution of occupation probabilities of ground and excited state\nand the average dipole moment of a two-level atom in resonant interaction\nwith a coherent classical field.\nThe coherent external field drives the population of the atomic system\nbetween the two available states with a period Tr = π/Ωr. Applying the field\nonly over half of this period leads to a complete inversion of the population.\nThese Rabi-oscillations have been observed in various systems ranging from\ngases to semiconductors. Interestingly, the light emitted from the coherently\ndriven two-level atom is not identical in frequency to the driving field. If\nwe look at the Fourier spectrum of the polarization according to Eq.(2.95),\nwe obtain lines at frequencies ω± = ωeg ± 2Ωr. This is clearly a nonlinear\noutput and the sidebands are called Mollow-sidebands [2] . Most important\nfor the existence of these oscillations is the coherence of the atomic system\nover at least one Rabi-oscillation. If this coherence is destroyed fast enough,\nthe Rabi-oscillations cannot happen and it is then impossible to generate\ninversion in a two-level system by interaction with light. This is the case for\na large class of situations in light-matter interaction. So we are interested\nwhat happens in the case of loss of coherence due to additional interaction\n\n2.3. BLOCH EQUATIONS\nof the atoms with a heat bath.\n2.3.4\nThe Density Operator\nTo study incoherent or dissipative processes it is useful to switch to a sta-\ntistical description using the density operator instead of deterministic wave\nfunctions similar to classical statistical mechanics, where the deterministic\ntrajectories of particles are replaced by probability distributions.\nThe density operator of a pure state is defined by the dyadic product of\nthe state with itself\nρ = |ψ >< ψ|\n(2.96)\nor in coordinate representation by a 2 × 2-matrix\nρ =\nμ ρee\nρeg\nρge\nρgg\n¶\n.\n(2.97)\nIn case of a pure state (2.46) this is\nρ =\nμ cec∗\ne\ncec∗\ng\ncgc∗\ne\ncgc∗\ng\n¶\n.\n(2.98)\nIt is obvious, that, for the rather simple case of a two-level system, each ele-\nment of the density matrix corresponds to a physical quantity. The main di-\nagonal contains the population probabilities for the levels and the off-diagonal\nelement is the expectation value of the positive or negative frequency compo-\nnent of the dipole moment of the atom, i.e. its contribution to the medium\npolarization.\nThe expectation value of an arbitrary operator A can be computed using\nthe trace formula\n< A >= Tr{ρA } =< ψ|A|ψ > .\n(2.99)\nThe advantage of the density operator is, that mixtures of pure states can\nalso be treated in a statistical sense. For example, if the atom is in state |e >\nwith probability pe and in state |g > with probability pg a density operator\nρ = pe|e >< e| + pg|g >< g|\n(2.100)\nis defined, which can be used to compute the average values of observables\nin the proper statistical sense\n< A >= Tr{ρA} = pe < e|A|e > +pg < g|A|g > .\n(2.101)\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nSince the matrices (2.64) to (2.67) build a complete base in the space of\n2 × 2-matrices, we can express the density matrix as\nρ\n=\nρee\n2(1 + σz) + ρgg\n2(1 -σz) + ρegσ+ + ρgeσ-\n(2.102)\n=\n21 + 1\n2(ρee -ρgg)σz + ρegσ+ + ρgeσ-,\n(2.103)\nsince the trace of the density matrix is always one (normalization). Choosing\nthe new base 1, σx, σy, σz, we obtain\nρ = 1\n21 + 1\n2(ρee -ρgg)σz + dxσx + dyσy,\n(2.104)\nwith\ndx\n=\n¡\nρeg + ρge\n¢\n= <{< σ(+) >},\n(2.105)\ndy\n=\nj\n¡\nρeg -ρge\n¢\n= ={< σ(+) >}.\n(2.106)\nThe expectation value of the dipole operator is given by (2.73)\n< p >= Tr{ρp} = -M∗Tr{ρ σ+} + c.c. = -M∗ρge + c.c.\n(2.107)\nFrom the Schrodinger equation for the wave function |ψ > we can eas-\nily derive the equation of motion for the density operator, called the von\nNeumann equation\nρ\n=\nd\ndt|ψ >< ψ| + h.c. = 1\nj~H|ψ >< ψ| -1\nj~|ψ >< ψ|H (2.108)\n=\nj~ [H, ρ] .\nDue to the linear nature of the equation, this is also the correct equation\nfor a density operator describing an arbitrary mixture of states. In case of a\ntwo-level atom, the von Neumann equation is\nρ = 1\nj~[HA, ρ] = -jω∈g\n2 [σz, ρ].\n(2.109)\n\n2.3.

Indeed in our case we are interested with\na radiating atom, i.e. it has a dipole interaction with the field. The coupling\nwith the infinitely many modes of the free field leads already to spontaneous\nemission, an irreversible process. We could treat this process by using the\nHamiltonian\nH = HA + HF + HA-F.\n(2.114)\nHere, HA is the Hamiltonian of the atom, HF of the free field and HA-F\ndescribes the interaction between them. A complete treatment along these\nlines is beyond the scope of this class and is usually done in classes on Quan-\ntum Mechanics. But the result of this calculation is simple and leads in the\nvon Neumann equation of the reduced density matrix, i.e. the density ma-\ntrix of the atom. With the spontaneous emission rate 1/τ sp,i.e. the inverse\nspontaneous life time τ sp, the populations change according to\nd\ndt|ce(t)|2 = d\ndtρee = -Γeρee + Γaρgg\n(2.115)\nwith the abbreviations\nΓe\n=\nτ sp\n(nth + 1),\n(2.116)\nΓa\n=\nτ sp\nnth.\n(2.117)\nHere, nth is the number of thermally excited photons in the modes of the free\nfield with frequency ωeg, nth = 1/(exp(~ωeg/kT) -1), at temperature T.\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nThe total probability of being in excited or ground state has to be main-\ntained, that is\nd\ndtρgg = -d\ndtρee = Γeρee -Γaρgg.\n(2.118)\nIf the populations decay, so does the polarization too, since ρge = c∗\necg, i.e.\nd\ndtρge = jωegρeg -Γe + Γa\nρge.\n(2.119)\nThus absorption as well as emission processes are also destructive to the\nphase, therefore, the corresponding rates add up in the phase decay rate.\nTaking the coherent (??-2.113) and incoherent processes (2.118-2.119)\ninto account results in the following equations for the normalized average\ndipole moment d = dx + jdy and the inversion w\nd\n=\nρge = (jωeg -1\nT2\n)d,\n(2.120)\nw\n=\nρee - ρgg = -w -w0\nT1\n,\n(2.121)\nwith the time constants\nT1\n= 2\nT2\n= Γe + Γa = 2nth + 1\nτ sp\n(2.122)\nand equilibrium inversion w0, due to the thermal excitation of the atom by\nthe thermal field\nw0 = Γa -Γe\nΓa + Γe\n=\n-1\n1 + 2nth\n= -tanh\nμ~ωeg\n2kT\n¶\n.\n(2.123)\nThe time constant T1 denotes the energy relaxation in the two-level system\nand T2 the phase relaxation. T2 is the correlation time between amplitudes\nce and cg. This coherence is destroyed by the interaction of the two -level\nsystem with the environment. In this model the energy relaxation is half the\nphase relaxation rate or\nT2 = 2T1.\n(2.124)\nThe atoms in a laser medium do not only interact with the electromagnetic\nfield, but in addition also with phonons of the host lattice, they might col-\nlide with each other in a gas laser and so on. All these processes must be\n\n2.3. BLOCH EQUATIONS\nconsidered when determining the energy and phase relaxation rates. Some\nof these processes are only destroying the phase, but do actually not lead to\nan energy loss in the system. Therefore, these processes reduce T2 but have\nno influence on T1. In real systems the phase relaxation time is most often\nmuch shorter than twice the energy relaxation time,\nT2 ≤2T1.\n(2.125)\nIf the inversion deviates from its equilibrium value w0 it relaxes back into\nequilibrium with a time constant T1. Eq. (2.123) shows that for all tem-\nperatures T > 0 the inversion is negative, i.e. the lower level is stronger\npopulated than the upper level. Thus with incoherent thermal light inver-\nsion in a two-level system cannot be achieved. Inversion can only be achieved\nby pumping with incoherent light, if there are more levels and subsequent\nrelaxation processes into the upper laser level. Due to these relaxation pro-\ncesses the rate Γa deviates from the equilibrium expression (2.117), and it\nhas to be replaced by the pump rate Λ. If the pump rate Λ exceeds Γe, the\ninversion corresponding to Eq. (2.123) becomes positive,\nw0 = Λ -Γe\nΛ + Γe\n.\n(2.126)\nIf we allow for artificial negative temperatures, we obtain with T < 0 for the\nratio of relaxation rates\nΓe\nΓa\n= 1 + n\nn\n= e\n~ωeg\nkT\n< 1.\n(2.127)\nThus the pumping of the two-level system drives the system far away from\nthermal equilibrium, which has to be expected.\n2.3.6\nThe Two-Level Atom with a Coherent Classical\nExternal Field\nIf there is in addition to the coupling to an external heat bath, which models\nthe spontaneous decay, pumping, and other incoherent processes, a coherent\nexternal field, the Hamiltonian has to be extended by the dipole interaction\nwith that field,\nHE = -pE(xA, t).\n(2.128)\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Like in Quantum Mechanics, it describes the spreading of a wave packet.\nHere, the spreading is due to the first nontrivial term in the dispersion rela-\ntion, which describes spreading of an electromagnetic wave packet via group\nvelocity dispersion (GVD).

MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\n2.6.2\nLoss and Gain\nIf the medium considered has loss, we can incorporate this loss into a complex\nrefractive index\nn(Ω) = nr(Ω) + jni(Ω).\n(2.185)\nThe refractive index is determined by the linear response, χ(Ω), of the po-\nlarization in the medium onto the electric field induced in the medium\nn(Ω) =\np\n1 + χ(Ω).\n(2.186)\nFor an optically thin medium, i.e. |χ(Ω)| ¿ 1 we obtain approximately\nn(Ω) ≈1 + χ(Ω)\n.\n(2.187)\nFor a two level atom with an electric dipole transition, the susceptibility\nis given, in the rotating wave approximation, by the complex Lorentzian\nlineshape\nχ(Ω) =\n2jα\n1 -jΩ-Ω0\n∆Ω\n,\n(2.188)\nwhere α will turn out to be the peak absorption or gain of the transition,\nwhich is proportional to the density of the atomic inversion, Ω0 is the center\nfrequency of the optical transition and ∆Ωis the HWHM linewidth of the\ntransition. Figure 2.11 shows the normalized real and imaginary part of the\ncomplex Lorentzian\nχr(Ω)\n=\n-2α (Ω-Ω0)\n∆Ω\n1 +\n¡Ω-Ω0\n∆Ω\n¢2,\n(2.189)\nχi(Ω)\n=\n2α\n1 +\n¡Ω-Ω0\n∆Ω\n¢2,\n(2.190)\nwhich are the real- and imaginary part of the complex susceptibility for\na noninverted optical transition, i.e. loss.\n\n2.6.

Therefore,\nthe wave equation (2.184) also treats the case of a complex refractive index.\nIf we assume a medium with the complex refractive index (2.187), then the\nwave number is given by\nK(Ω) = Ω\nc0\nμ\n1 + 1\n2 (χr(Ω) + jχi(Ω))\n¶\n.\n(2.191)\nSince we introduced a complex wave number, we have to redefine the group\nvelocity as the inverse derivative of the real part of the wave number with\nrespect to frequency. At line center, we obtain\nv-1\ng\n= ∂Kr(Ω)\n∂Ω\n\nΩ0\n= 1\nc0\nμ\n1 -α Ω0\n∆Ω\n¶\n.\n(2.192)\nThus, for a narrow absorption line, α > 0 and\nΩ0\n∆ΩA 1, the absolute value\nof the group velocity can become much larger than the velocity of light in\n\nCHAPTER 2. MAXWELL-BLOCH EQUATIONS\nvacuum.\nThe opposite is true for an inverted, and therefore, amplifying\ntransition, α < 0. There is nothing wrong with it, since the group velocity\nonly describes the motion of the peak of a Gaussian wave packet, which is\nnot a causal wave packet. A causal wave packet is identical to zero for some\nearlier time t < t0, in some region of space. A Gaussian wave packet fills the\nwhole space at any time and can be reconstructed by a Taylor expansion at\nany time. Therefore, the tachionic motion of the peak of such a signal does\nnot contradict special relativity.\nThe imaginary part in the wave vector (2.191), due to gain and loss, has\nto be completely treated in the envelope equation (2.184). In the frequency\ndomain this leads for a wave packet with a carrier frequency at line center,\nω0 = Ω0 and Kr(Ω0) = k0, to the term\n∂ A(z, ω)\n∂z\n\n(loss)\n=\n-αk0\n1 +\n¡ ω\n∆Ω\n¢2 A(z, ω).\n(2.193)\nIn the time domain, we obtain up to second order in the inverse linewidth\n∂A(z, t)\n∂z\n\n(loss)\n= -αk0\nμ\n1 +\n∆Ω2\n∂2\n∂t2\n¶\nA(z, t),\n(2.194)\nwhich corresponds to a parabolic approximation of the Lorentzian line shape\nat line center, (Fig. 2.11). For an inverted optical transition, we obtain a\nsimilar equation, we only have to replace the loss by gain\n∂A(z, t)\n∂z\n\n(gain)\n= g\nμ\n1 + 1\nΩ2g\n∂2\n∂t2\n¶\nA(z, t),\n(2.195)\nwhere g = -αk0 is the peak gain at line center per unit length and Ωg is\nthe HWHM linewidth of the gain transition. The gain is proportional to the\ninversion in the atomic system, see Eq.(2.149), which also depends on the\nfield strength or intensity according to the rate equation (2.172)\n∂g(z, t)\n∂t\n= -g -g0\nτ L\n-g|A(z, t)|2\nEL\n.\n(2.196)\nHere, EL is the saturation fluence of the gain medium and τ L the life time\nof the inversion, i.e. the upper-state life time of the gain medium.\n\n2.7.

      "content": "Chapter 3\nNonlinear Pulse Propagation\nThere are many nonlinear pulse propagation problems worthwhile of being\nconsidered in detail, such as pulse propagation through a two-level medium\nin the coherent regime, which leads to self-induced transparency and solitons\ngoverned by the Sinus-Gordon-Equation. The basic model for the medium is\nthe two-level atom discussed before with infinitely long relaxation times T1,2,\ni.e. assuming that the pulses are much shorter than the dephasing time in the\nmedium. In such a medium pulses exist, where the first half of the pulse fully\ninverts the medium and the second half of the pulse extracts the energy from\nthe medium. The integral over the Rabi-frequency as defined in Eq.(2.39) is\nthan a mutiple of 2π. The interested reader is refered to the book of Allen\nand Eberly [1]. Here, we are interested in the nonlinear dynamics due to\nthe Kerr-effect which is most important for understanding pulse propagation\nproblems in optical communications and short pulse generation.\n3.1\nThe Optical Kerr-effect\nIn an isotropic and homogeneous medium, the refractive index can not de-\npend on the direction of the electric field. Therefore, to lowest order, the\nrefractive index of such a medium can only depend quadratically on the\nfield, i.e. on the intensity [22]\nn = n(ω, |A|2) ≈n0(ω) + n2,L|A|2.\n(3.1)\nHere, we assume, that the pulse envelope A is normalized such that |A|2 is\nthe intensity of the pulse. This is the optical Kerr effect and n2,L is called\n\nCHAPTER 3.

Note, the nonlinear in-\ndex depends on the polarization of the field and without going further into\ndetails, we assume that we treat a linearily polarized electric field. For most\ntransparent materials the intensity dependent refractive index is positive.\n3.2\nSelf-Phase Modulation (SPM)\nIn a purely one dimensional propagation problem, the intensity dependent\nrefractive index imposes an additional self-phase shift on the pulse envelope\nduring propagation, which is proportional to the instantaneous intensity of\nthe pulse\n∂A(z, t)\n∂z\n= -jk0n2,L|A(z, t)|2A(z, t) = -jδ|A(z, t)|2A(z, t).\n(3.2)\nwhere δ = k0n2,L is the self-phase modulation coefficient. Self-phase modu-\nlation (SPM) leads only to a phase shift in the time domain. Therefore, the\nintensity profile of the pulse does not change only the spectrum of the pulse\nchanges, as discussed in the class on nonlinear optics. Figure (3.1) shows\nthe spectrum of a Gaussian pulse subject to SPM during propagation (for\nδ = 2 and normalized units). New frequency components are generated by\nthe nonlinear process via four wave mixing (FWM). If we look at the phase of\nthe pulse during propagation due to self-phase modulation, see Fig. 3.2 (a),\nwe find, that the pulse redistributes its energy, such that the low frequency\ncontributions are in the front of the pulse and the high frequencies in the\nback of the pulse, similar to the case of positive dispersion.\n\n3.2.

THE NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION\n3.3\nThe Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation\nIf both effects, dispersion and self-phase modulation, act simultaneously on\nthe pulse, the field envelope obeys the equation\nj ∂A(z, t)\n∂z\n= -D2\n∂2A\n∂t2 + δ|A|2A,\n(3.3)\nThis equation is called the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NSE) - if we\nput the imaginary unit on the left hand side -, since it has the form of a\nSchrodinger Equation.\nIts called nonlinear, because the potential energy\nis derived from the square of the wave function itself.\nAs we have seen\nfrom the discussion in the last sections, positive dispersion and positive self-\nphase modulation lead to a similar redistribution of the spectral components.\nThis enhances the pulse spreading in time. However, if we have negative\ndispersion, i.e. a wave packet with high carrier frequency travels faster than\na wave packet with a low carrier frequency, then, the high frequency wave\npackets generated by self-phase modulation in the front of the pulse have\na chance to catch up with the pulse itself due to the negative dispersion.\nThe opposite is the case for the low frequencies. This arrangement results\nin pulses that do not disperse any more, i.e. solitary waves. That negative\ndispersion is necessary to compensate the positive Kerr effect is also obvious\nfrom the NSE (3.3). Because, for a positive Kerr effect, the potential energy\nin the NSE is always negative. There are only bound solutions, i.e. bright\nsolitary waves, if the kinetic energy term, i.e. the dispersion, has a negative\nsign, D2 < 0.\n3.3.1\nThe Solitons of the NSE\nIn the following, we study different solutions of the NSE for the case of\nnegative dispersion and positive self-phase modulation. We do not intend\nto give a full overview over the solution manyfold of the NSE in its full\nmathematical depth here, because it is not necessary for the following. This\ncan be found in detail elsewhere [4, 5, 6, 7].\nWithout loss of generality, by normalization of the field amplitude A =\nA\nτ\nq\n2D2\nδ , the propagation distance z = z · τ 2/D2, and the time t = t · τ,\nthe NSE (3.3) with negative dispersion can always be transformed into the\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nnormalized form\nj ∂A (z , t)\n∂z\n= ∂2A\n∂t 2 + 2|A |2A\n(3.4)\nThis is equivalent to set D2 = -1 and δ = 2. For the numerical simulations,\nwhich are shown in the next chapters, we simulate the normalized eq.(3.4)\nand the axes are in normalized units of position and time.\n3.3.2\nThe Fundamental Soliton\nWe look for a stationary wave function of the NSE (3.3), such that its absolute\nsquare is a self-consistent potential. A potential of that kind is well known\nfrom Quantum Mechanics, the sech2-Potential [8], and therefore the shape of\nthe solitary pulse is a sech\nAs(z, t) = A0sech\nμ t\nτ\n¶\ne-jθ,\n(3.5)\nwhere θ is the nonlinear phase shift of the soliton\nθ = 1\n2δA2\n0z\n(3.6)\nThe soltion phase shift is constant over the pulse with respect to time in\ncontrast to the case of self-phase modulation only, where the phase shift is\nproportional to the instantaneous power. The balance between the nonlinear\neffects and the linear effects requires that the nonlinear phase shift is equal\nto the dispersive spreading of the pulse\nθ = |D2|\nτ 2 z.\n(3.7)\nSince the field amplitude A(z, t) is normalized, such that the absolute square\nis the intensity, the soliton energy fluence is given by\nw =\nZ inf\n-inf\n|As(z, t)|2dt = 2A2\n0τ.\n(3.8)\nFrom eqs.(3.6) to (3.8), we obtain for constant pulse energy fluence, that the\nwidth of the soliton is proportional to the amount of negative dispersion\nτ = 4|D2|\nδw .\n(3.9)\n\n3.3. THE NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION\nNote, the pulse area for a fundamental soliton is only determined by the\ndispersion and the self-phase modulation coefficient\nPulse Area =\nZ inf\n-inf\n|As(z, t)|dt = πA0τ = π\nr\n|D2|\n2δ .\n(3.10)\nThus, an initial pulse with a different area can not just develope into a pure\nsoliton.\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0.5\n1.5\nAmplitude\nDistance z\nTime\nFigure 3.3: Propagation of a fundamental soliton.\nFig. 3.3 shows the numerical solution of the NSE for the fundamental\nsoliton pulse. The distance, after which the soliton aquires a phase shift of\nπ/4, is called the soliton period, for reasons, which will become clear in the\nnext section.\nSince the dispersion is constant over the frequency, i.e.\nthe NSE has\nno higher order dispersion, the center frequency of the soliton can be chosen\narbitrarily. However, due to the dispersion, the group velocities of the solitons\nwith different carrier frequencies will be different.\nOne easily finds by a\nGallilei tranformation to a moving frame, that the NSE posseses the following\ngeneral fundamental soliton solution\nAs(z, t) = A0sech(x(z, t))e-jθ(z,t),\n(3.11)\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nwith\nx = 1\nτ (t -2|D2|p0z -t0),\n(3.12)\nand a nonlinear phase shift\nθ = p0(t -t0) + |D2|\nμ 1\nτ 2 -p2\n¶\nz + θ0.\n(3.13)\nThus, the energy fluence w or amplitude A0, the carrier frequency p0, the\nphase θ0 and the origin t0, i.e. the timing of the fundamental soliton are\nnot yet determined. Only the soliton area is fixed. The energy fluence and\nwidth are determined if one of them is specified, given a certain dispersion\nand SPM-coefficient.\n3.3.3\nHigher Order Solitons\nThe NSE has constant dispersion, in our case negative dispersion.\nThat\nmeans the group velocity depends linearly on frequency. We assume, that\ntwo fundamental soltions are far apart from each other, so that they do not\ninteract. Then this linear superpositon is for all practical purposes another\nsolution of the NSE. If we choose the carrier frequency of the soliton, starting\nat a later time, higher than the one of the soliton in front, the later soliton\nwill catch up with the leading soliton due to the negative dispersion and the\npulses will collide.\nFigure 3.4 shows this situation. Obviously, the two pulses recover com-\npletely from the collision, i.e. the NSE has true soliton solutions. The solitons\nhave particle like properties. A solution, composed of several fundamental\nsolitons, is called a higher order soliton. If we look closer to figure 3.4, we\nrecognize, that the soliton at rest in the local time frame, and which follows\nthe t = 0 line without the collision, is somewhat pushed forward due to the\ncollision. A detailed analysis of the collision would also show, that the phases\nof the solitons have changed [4]. The phase changes due to soliton collisions\nare used to built all optical switches [10], using backfolded Mach-Zehnder in-\nterferometers, which can be realized in a self-stabilized way by Sagnac fiber\nloops.\n\n3.3.

THE NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION\nThe NSE also shows higher order soliton solutions, that travel at the same\nspeed, i.e. they posses the same carrier frequency, the so called breather\nsolutions. Figures 3.5(a) and (b) show the amplitude and spectrum of such\na higher order soliton solution, which has twice the area of the fundamental\nsoliton. The simulation starts with a sech-pulse, that has twice the area of\nthe fundamental soliton, shown in figure 3.3. Due to the interaction of the\ntwo solitons, the temporal shape and the spectrum exhibits a complicated but\nperiodic behaviour. This period is the soliton period z = π/4, as mentioned\nabove.\nAs can be seen from Figures 3.5(a) and 3.5(b), the higher order\nsoliton dynamics leads to an enormous pulse shortening after half of the\nsoliton period. This process has been used by Mollenauer, to build his soliton\nlaser [11]. In the soliton laser, the pulse compression, that occures for a\nhigher order soliton as shown in Fig. 3.5(a), is exploited for modelocking.\nMollenauer pioneered soliton propagation in optical fibers, as proposed by\nHasegawa and Tappert [3], with the soliton laser, which produced the first\npicosecond pulses at 1.55 μm. A detailed account on the soliton laser is given\nby Haus [12].\nSo far, we have discussed the pure soliton solutions of the NSE. But,\nwhat happens if one starts propagation with an input pulse that does not\ncorrespond to a fundamental or higher order soliton?\n3.3.4\nInverse Scattering Theory\nObviously, the NSE has solutions, which are composed of fundamental soli-\ntons. Thus, the solutions obey a certain superposition principle which is\nabsolutely surprising for a nonlinear system. Of course, not arbitrary super-\npositions are possible as in a linear system. The deeper reason for the solution\nmanyfold of the NSE can be found by studying its physical and mathemat-\nical properties. The mathematical basis for an analytic formulation of the\nsolutions to the NSE is the inverse scattering theory [13, 14, 4, 15]. It is a\nspectral tranform method for solving integrable, nonlinear wave equations,\nsimilar to the Fourier transform for the solution of linear wave equations [16].\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nFigure 3.6: Fourier transform method for the solution of linear, time invariant\npartial differential equations.\nFigure 3.7: Schematic representation of the inverse scattering theory for the\nsolution of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations.\nLet's remember briefly, how to solve an initial value problem for a linear\npartial differential equation (p.d.e.), like eq.(2.184), that treats the case of\na purely dispersive pulse propagation. The method is sketched in Fig. 3.6.\nWe Fourier tranform the initial pulse into the spectral domain, because, the\nexponential functions are eigensolutions of the differential operators with\n\n3.3. THE NONLINEAR SCHRODINGER EQUATION\nconstant coefficients. The right side of (2.184) is only composed of powers of\nthe differntial operator, therefore the exponentials are eigenfunctions of the\ncomplete right side. Thus, after Fourier transformation, the p.d.e. becomes\na set of ordinary differential equations (o.d.e.), one for each partial wave.\nThe excitation of each wave is given by the spectrum of the initial wave.\nThe eigenvalues of the differential operator, that constitutes the right side\nof (2.184), is given by the dispersion relation, k(ω), up to the imaginary\nunit. The solution of the remaining o.d.e is then a simple exponential of the\ndispersion relation. Now, we have the spectrum of the propagated wave and\nby inverse Fourier transformation, i.e. we sum over all partial waves, we find\nthe new temporal shape of the propagated pulse.\nAs in the case of the Fourier transform method for the solution of linear\nwave equations, the inverse scattering theory is again based on a spectral\ntransform, (Fig.3.7). However, this transform depends now on the details\nof the wave equation and the initial conditions. This dependence leads to\na modified superposition principle. As is shown in [7], one can formulate\nfor many integrable nonlinear wave equations a related scattering problem\nlike one does in Quantum Theory for the scattering of a particle at a poten-\ntial well. However, the potential well is now determined by the solution of\nthe wave equation. Thus, the initial potential is already given by the ini-\ntial conditions. The stationary states of the scattering problem, which are\nthe eigensolutions of the corresponding Hamiltonian, are the analog to the\nmonochromatic complex oscillations, which are the eigenfunctions of the dif-\nferential operator. The eigenvalues are the analog to the dispersion relation,\nand as in the case of the linear p.d.e's, the eigensolutions obey simple linear\no.d.e's.\nA given potential will have a certain number of bound states, that cor-\nrespond to the discrete spectrum and a continuum of scattering states. The\ncharacteristic of the continuous eigenvalue spectrum is the reflection coef-\nficient for waves scatterd upon reflection at the potential. Thus, a certain\npotential, i.e. a certain initial condition, has a certain discrete spectrum and\ncontinuum with a corresponding reflection coefficient. From inverse scatter-\ning theory for quantum mechanical and electromagnetic scattering problems,\nwe know, that the potenial can be reconstructed from the scattering data,\ni.e. the reflection coefficient and the data for the discrete spectrum [?]. This\nis true for a very general class of scattering potentials. As one can almost\nguess now, the discrete eigenstates of the initial conditions will lead to soliton\nsolutions. We have already studied the dynamics of some of these soliton so-\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nlutions above. The continuous spectrum will lead to a dispersive wave which\nis called the continuum. Thus, the most general solution of the NSE, for\ngiven arbitrary initial conditions, is a superposition of a soliton, maybe a\nhigher order soliton, and a continuum contribution.\nThe continuum will disperse during propagation, so that only the soliton\nis recognized after a while. Thus, the continuum becomes an asympthotically\nsmall contribution to the solution of the NSE. Therefore, the dynamics of\nthe continuum is completely discribed by the linear dispersion relation of the\nwave equation.\nThe back transformation from the spectral to the time domain is not as\nsimple as in the case of the Fourier transform for linear p.d.e's. One has to\nsolve a linear integral equation, the Marchenko equation [17]. Nevertheless,\nthe solution of a nonlinear equation has been reduced to the solution of two\nlinear problems, which is a tremendous success.\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n-4\n-2\n0.5\n1.5\n2.5\nAmplitude\nDistance z\nTime\nFigure 3.8: Solution of the NSE for an unchirped and rectangular shaped\ninitial pulse.\n\n3.4. UNIVERSALITY OF THE NSE\nTo appreciate these properties of the solutions of the NSE, we solve the\nNSE for a rectangular shaped initial pulse. The result is shown in Fig. 3.8.\nThe scattering problem, that has to be solved for this initial condition,\nis the same as for a nonrelativistic particle in a rectangular potential box\n[32]. The depth of the potential is chosen small enough, so that it has only\none bound state. Thus, we start with a wave composed of a fundamental\nsoliton and continuum. It is easy to recognize the continuum contribution,\ni.e. the dispersive wave, that separates from the soliton during propagation.\nThis solution illustrates, that soliton pulse shaping due to the presence of\ndispersion and self-phase modulation may have a strong impact on pulse\ngeneration [18]. When the dispersion and self-phase modulation are properly\nadjusted, soliton formation can lead to very clean, stable, and extremly short\npulses in a modelocked laser.\n3.4\nUniversality of the NSE\nAbove, we derived the NSE in detail for the case of disperison and self-phase\nmodulation. The input for the NSE is surprisingly low, we only have to\nadmitt the first nontrivial dispersive effect and the lowest order nonlinear\neffect that is possible in an isotropic and homogeneous medium like glass,\ngas or plasmas. Therefore, the NSE and its properties are important for\nmany other effects like self-focusing [19], Langmuir waves in plasma physics,\nand waves in proteine molecules [20]. Self-focusing will be treated in more\ndetail later, because it is the basis for Kerr-Lens Mode Locking.\n3.5\nSoliton Perturbation Theory\nFrom the previous discussion, we have full knowledge about the possible\nsolutions of the NSE that describes a special Hamiltonian system. However,\nthe NSE hardly describes a real physical system such as, for example, a real\noptical fiber in all its aspects [21, 22]. Indeed the NSE itself, as we have\nseen during the derivation in the previous sections, is only an approximation\nto the complete wave equation. We approximated the dispersion relation\nby a parabola at the assumed carrier frequency of the soliton.\nAlso the\ninstantaneous Kerr effect described by an intensity dependent refractive index\nis only an approximation to the real χ(3)-nonlinearity of a Kerr-medium [23,\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\n24].\nTherefore, it is most important to study what happens to a soliton\nsolution of the NSE due to perturbing effects like higher order dispersion,\nfinite response times of the nonlinearites, gain and the finite gain bandwidth\nof amplifiers, that compensate for the inevitable loss in a real system.\nThe investigation of solitons under perturbations is as old as the solitons\nitself. Many authors treat the perturbing effects in the scattering domain\n[25, 26]. Only recently, a perturbation theory on the basis of the linearized\nNSE has been developed, which is much more illustrative then a formulation\nin the scattering amplitudes. This was first used by Haus [27] and rigorously\nformulated by Kaup [28]. In this section, we will present this approach as\nfar as it is indispensible for the following.\nA system, where the most important physical processes are dispersion\nand self-phase modulation, is described by the NSE complimented with some\nperturbation term F\n∂A(z, t)\n∂z\n= -j\n∙\n|D2|∂2A\n∂t2 + δ|A|2A\n\n+ F(A, A∗, z).\n(3.14)\nIn the following, we are interested what happens to a solution of the full\nequation (3.14) which is very close to a fundamental soliton, i.e.\nA(z, t) =\n∙\na( t\nτ ) + ∆A(z, t)\n\ne-jksz.\n(3.15)\nHere, a(x) is the fundamental soliton according to eq.(3.5)\na( t\nτ ) = A0 sech( t\nτ ),\n(3.16)\nand\nks = 1\n2δA2\n(3.17)\nis the phase shift of the soliton per unit length, i.e. the soltion wave vector.\nA deviation from the ideal soliton can arise either due to the additional\ndriving term F on the right side or due to a deviation already present in\nthe initial condition. We use the form (3.15) as an ansatz to solve the NSE\nto first order in the perturbation ∆A, i.e. we linearize the NSE around the\nfundamental soliton and obtain for the perturbation\n∂∆A\n∂z\n=\n-jks\n∙μ ∂2\n∂x2 -1\n¶\n∆A + 2sech2(x) (2∆A + ∆A∗)\n\n+F(A, A∗, z)ejksz,\n(3.18)\n\n3.5. SOLITON PERTURBATION THEORY\nwhere x = t/τ. Due to the nonlinearity, the field is coupled to its complex\nconjugate. Thus, eq.(3.18) corresponds actually to two equations, one for the\namplitude and one for its complex conjugate. Therefore, we introduce the\nvector notation\n∆A =\nμ ∆A\n∆A∗\n¶\n.\n(3.19)\nWe further introduce the normalized propagation distance z0 = ksz and the\nnormalized time x = t/τ. The linearized perturbed NSE is then given by\n∂\n∂z0∆A = L∆A + 1\nks\nF(A, A∗, z)ejz0\n(3.20)\nHere, L is the operator which arises from the linearization of the NSE\nL = -jσ3\n∙\n( ∂2\n∂x2 -1) + 2 sech2(x)(2 + σ1)\n\n,\n(3.21)\nwhere σi, i = 1, 2, 3 are the Pauli matrices. For a solution of the inhomoge-\nneous equation (3.20), we need the eigenfunctions and the spectrum of the\ndifferential operator L. We found in section 3.3.2, that the fundamental soli-\nton has four degrees of freedom, four free parameters. This gives already four\nknown eigensolutions and mainsolutions of the linearized NSE, respectively.\nThey are determined by the derivatives of the general fundamental soliton\nsolutions according to eqs.(3.11) to (3.13) with respect to free parameters.\nThese eigenfunctions are\nfw(x)\n=\nw(1 -x tanh x)a(x)\nμ 1\n¶\n,\n(3.22)\nfθ(x)\n=\n-ja(x)\nμ 1\n-1\n¶\n,\n(3.23)\nfp(x)\n=\n-j xτa(x)\nμ 1\n-1\n¶\n,\n(3.24)\nft(x)\n=\nτ tanh(x) a(x)\nμ 1\n¶\n,\n(3.25)\nand they describe perturbations of the soliton energy, phase, carrier frequency\nand timing. One component of each of these vector functions is shown in Fig.\n3.9.\n\nCHAPTER 3.

SOLITON PERTURBATION THEORY\nEquations (3.26) and (3.28) indicate, that perturbations in energy and\ncarrier frequency are converted to additional phase and timing fluctuations\nof the pulse due to SPM and GVD. This is the base for soliton squeezing in\noptical fibers [27]. The timing and phase perturbations can increase without\nbounds, because the system is autonomous, the origin for the Gordon-Haus\neffect, [29] and there is no phase reference in the system. The full continuous\nspectrum of the linearized NSE has been studied by Kaup [28] and is given\nby\nLfk = λkfk,\n(3.30)\nλk = j(k2 + 1),\n(3.31)\nfk(x) = e-jkx\nμ (k -jtanhx)2\nsech2x\n¶\n,\n(3.32)\nand\nL fk = λk fk,\n(3.33)\nλk = -j(k2 + 1),\n(3.34)\nfk = σ1fk.\n(3.35)\nOur definition of the eigenfunctions is slightly different from Kaup [28], be-\ncause we also define the inner product in the complex space as\n< u|v >= 1\nZ +inf\n-inf\nu+(x)v(x)dx.\n(3.36)\nAdopting this definition, the inner product of a vector with itself in the\nsubspace where the second component is the complex conjugate of the first\ncomponent is the energy of the signal, a physical quantity.\nThe operator L is not self-adjoint with respect to this inner product. The\nphysical origin for this mathematical property is, that the linearized system\ndoes not conserve energy due to the parametric pumping by the soliton.\nHowever, from (3.21) and (3.36), we can easily see that the adjoint operator\nis given by\nL+ = -σ3Lσ3,\n(3.37)\nand therefore, we obtain for the spectrum of the adjoint operator\nL+f\n(+)\nk\n= λ(+)\nk f(+)\nk\n,\n(3.38)\nλ(+)\nk\n= -j (k2 + 1),\n(3.39)\nf(+)\nk\n=\nπ(k2 + 1)2σ3fk,\n(3.40)\n\nCHAPTER 3.

In a mode-locked laser system, most often the nonlinearity,\ndispersion and gain occur in a lumped manner. The solitons propagating in\nthese systems are only average solitons, which propagate through discrete\ncomponents in a periodic fashion, as we will see later.\nThe effect of this periodic perturbations can be modelled by an additional\nterm F in the perturbed NSE according to Eq.(3.14)\nF(A, A∗, z) = jξ\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nδ(z -nzA)A(z, t).\n(3.64)\n\n3.6.

As an example\nFig. 3.10 shows the resonant sidebands observed in a fiber laser. For optical\ncommunication systems this condition requires that the soliton energy has\nto be kept small enough, so that the soliton periode is much longer than the\ndistance between amplifiers, which constitute periodic perturbations to the\nsoliton.These sidebands are often called Kelly-Sidebands, according to the\nperson who first described its origin properly [30].\nTo illustrate its importance we discuss the spectrum observed from the\nlongcavity Ti:sapphire laser system illustrated in Figure 3.11 and described\nin full detail in [37].\nDue to the low repetitionrate, a rather large pulse\nenergy builts up in the cavity, which leads to a large nonlinear phase shift\nper roundtrip.Figure 3.12 shows the spectrum of the output from the laser.\nThe Kelly sidebands are clearly visible.

PULSE COMPRESSION\n3.7\nPulse Compression\nSo far we have discussed propagation of a pulse in negative dispersive media\nand positive self-phase modulation. Then at large enough pulse energy a\nsoliton can form, because the low and high frequency components generated\nby SPM in the front and the back of the pulse are slow and fast and therefore\ncatch up with the pulse and stay together. What happens if the dispersion\nis positive? Clearly, the low and high frequency components generated by\nSPM in the front and back of the pulse are fast and slow and move away from\nthe pulse in a continuous fashion. This leads to highly but linearly chirped\npulse, which can be compressed after the nonlinear propagation by sending\nit through a linear negative dispersive medium or prism pair or grating pair.\nIn that way, pulses can be compressed by large factors of 3 to 20. This pulse\ncompression process can be formulated in a more general way.\n3.7.1\nGeneral Pulse Compression Scheme\nThe general scheme for pulse compression of optical pulses was independently\nproposed by Gires and Tournois in 1964 [38] and Giordmaine et al. in 1968\n[39]. The input pulse is first spectrally broadened by a phase modulator. The\nphase over the generated spectrum is hopefully in a form that can be con-\nveniently removed afterwards, i.e. all spectral components can be rephased\nto generate a short as possible pulse in the time domain. To compress fem-\ntosecond pulses an ultrafast phase modulator has to be used, that is the pulse\nhas to modulate its phase itself by self-phase modulation. In 1969 Fisher et\nal. [40] proposed that picosecond pulses can be compressed to femtosecond\nduration using the large positive chirp produced around the peak of a short\npulse by SPM in an optical Kerr liquid. In the same year Laubereau [41] used\nseveral cells containing CS2 and a pair of diffraction gratings to compress, by\napproximately ten times, 20-ps pulses generated by a mode-locked Nd:glass\nlaser.\nAs discussed in section 3.2, the optical Kerr effect in a medium gives\nrise to an intensity dependent change of the refractive index ∆n = n2,LI(t),\nwhere n2,L is the nonlinear-index coefficient and I(t) is the optical inten-\nsity. The self-induced intensity-dependent nonlinear phase shift experienced\nby an optical field during its propagation in a Kerr medium of length c is\ngiven by ∆φ(t) = -(ω0/c)n2I(t)c where ω0 is the carrier frequency of the\npulse. The induced frequency sweep over the pulse can be calculated from\n\nCHAPTER 3.

Around the central part of the pulse, where\nmost of the energy is concentrated, the phase is parabolic, leading to an\napproximately linear chirp in frequency. The region with linear chirp can\nbe enlarged in the presence of positive dispersion in a Kerr medium of the\nsame sign [42]. To compress the spectrally broadened and chirped pulse,\na dispersive delay line can be used, characterized by a nearly linear group\ndelay Tg(ω). Or if the chirp generated over the newly generated spectrum\nis nonlinear this chirp needs to be removed by a correspondingly nonlinear\ngroup delay Tg(ω). Figure 3.13 shows that in the case SPM and positive\nGDD a smoother spectrum with more linear chirp is created and therefore\nthe final compressed pulse is of higher quality, i.e. a higher percentage of the\ntotal pulse energy is really concentrated in the short pulse and not in a large\nuncompressed pulse pedestal.\nFor a beam propagating in a homogenous medium,unfortunately the non-\nlinear refractive index does not only lead to a temporal phase modulation but\nalso to a spatial phase modulation, which leads to self-focusing or defocus-\ning and small-scale instabilities [43]. Therefore, a fundamental requirement\nNakatsuka, H., D. Grischkowsky, and A. C.

PULSE COMPRESSION\nfor pulse compression is that the Kerr effect is provided by a guiding non-\nlinear medium so that a spatially uniform spectral broadening is obtained.\nIn 1974 Ippen et al. reported the first measurement of SPM in the absence\nof self-trapping and self-focusing by using a guiding multimode optical fiber\nfilled with liquid CS2 [44]. In 1978 Stolen and Lin reported measurements of\nSPM in single-mode silica core fibers [45]. The important advantage of the\nsingle-mode fiber is that the phase modulation can be imposed over the entire\ntransverse profile of the beam, thus removing the problem of unmodulated\nlight in the wings of the beam [44]. In 1981 Nakatsuka et al. [42] performed\nthe first pulse compression experiment using fibers as a Kerr medium in the\npositive dispersion region.\n3.7.2\nSpectral Broadening with Guided Modes\nThe electric field of a guided mode can be written as [52]:\nE(r, ω) = A(z, ω)F(x, y) exp[iβ(ω)z]\n(3.77)\nwhere A(z, ω) is the mode-amplitude for a given frequency component, F(x, y)\nis the mode-transverse field distribution and β(ω) is the mode-propagation\nconstant. The propagation equation for the guided field splits into two equa-\ntions for amplitude A(z, ω) and field pattern F(x, y). In first order pertur-\nbation theory a perturbation ∆n = n2|E|2 of the refractive index, which is\nmuch smaller than the index step that defines the mode, does not change the\nmodal distribution F(x, y), while the mode propagation constant β(ω) can\nbe written as β(ω) = β(ω) + ∆β , where the perturbation ∆β is given by\n∆β = (ω0/c) R R ∆n|F(x, y)|2dxdy\nR R\n|F(x, y)|2dxdy\n.\n(3.78)\nAs shown by Eq.(3.78), the perturbation ∆β, which includes the effect due\nto the fiber nonlinearity, is related to a spatial average on the fiber trans-\nverse section of the perturbation ∆n. In this way, spatially uniform SPM is\nrealized.\nUsing regular single mode fibers and prism-grating compressors, pulses as\nshort as 6 fs at 620 nm were obtained in 1987 from 50-fs pulses generated by\na colliding-pulse mode-locking dye laser [46] see Figure 3.14. More recently,\n13-fs pulses from a cavity-dumped Ti:sapphire laser were compressed to 4.5\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nFigure 3.14: Fiber-grating pulse compressor to generate femtosecond pulses\n[53]\nfs with the same technique using a compressor consisting of a quartz 45*-\nprism pair, broadband chirped mirrors and thin-film Gires-Tournois dielectric\ninterferometers [47, 54]. The use of a single-mode optical fiber limits the pulse\nenergy to a few nanojoule.\nIn 1996, using a phase modulator consisting of a hollow fiber (leaky\nwaveguide) filled with noble gas, a powerful pulse compression technique\nhas been introduced, which handles high-energy pulses [48]. The implemen-\ntation of the hollow-fiber compression technique using 20-fs seed pulses from\na Ti:sapphire system and chirped-mirrors that form a dispersive delay line\nhas led to the generation of pulses with duration down to 4.5 fs [49] and en-\nergy up to 0.55 mJ [50]. This technique presents the advantages of a guiding\nelement with a large-diameter mode and of a fast nonlinear medium with\nhigh damage threshold.\nThe possibility to take advantage of the ultrabroadband spectrum which\ncan be generated by the phase modulation process, is strictly related to the\ndevelopment of dispersive delay lines capable of controlling the frequency-\ndependent group delay over such bandwidth.\n3.7.3\nDispersion Compensation Techniques\nThe pulse frequency sweep (chirp) imposed by the phase modulation is ap-\nproximately linear near the peak of the pulse, where most of the energy is\nconcentrated. In the presence of dispersion in the phase modulator the chirp\nbecomes linear over almost the whole pulse. Therefore, optimum temporal\ncompression requires a group delay, Tg,comp(ω) = ∂φ/∂ω, characterized by a\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nInput Pulse\nOptical fiber\nGrating Pair\nSpectrally Broadened Pulse\nCompressed pulse\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nnearly linear dependence on frequency in the dispersive delay line. Since in\nthe case of SPM the nonlinear index n2 is generally positive far from reso-\nnance, a negative group delay dispersion (GDD = ∂Tg/∂ω) is required in\nthe compressor. In order to generate the shortest pulses, the pulse group de-\nlay after the phase modulator and the compressor must be nearly frequency\nindependent. Tg(ω) can be expanded into a Taylor series around the central\nfrequency ω0:\nTg(ω) = φ0(ω0) + φ00(ω0)∆ω + 1\n2φ000(ω0)∆ω2 + 1\n3!φ0000(ω0)∆ω3 + · · ·\n(3.79)\nwhere ∆ω = ω -ω0, and φ00(ω0), φ000(ω0), and φ0000(ω0) are the second-, the\nthird-, and the fourth-order-dispersion terms, respectively. Critical values of\nthese dispersion terms above which dispersion causes a significant change of\nthe pulse are given by a simple scaling expression: φ(n) = τ n\np, where φ(n) is\nthe nth-order dispersion term and τ p is the pulse duration. For example,\na second order dispersion with φ00 = τ 2\np results in a pulse broadening by\nmore than a factor of two. Therefore dispersion-induced pulse broadening\nand distortion become increasingly important for decreasing pulse durations.\nEquation (3.79) shows that to compress a pulse to near the transform limit\none should eliminate these high order dispersion terms. For instance, assum-\ning a transform-limited input pulse to the phase modulator, the condition\nfor third-order-dispersion-compensated compression is the following:\nφ00(ω0)\n=\nφ00\nmodulator + φ00\ncompresssor = 0\n(3.80)\nφ000(ω0)\n=\nφ000\nmodulator + φ000\ncompresssor = 0\n(3.81)\nSeveral compressor schemes have been developed so far that included such\ncomponents as: diffraction gratings, Brewster-cut prism pairs, combination\nof gratings and prisms, thin prisms and chirped mirrors, and chirped mirrors\nonly, etc. In the following we will briefly outline the main characteristics of\nthese compressor schemes.\nGrating and Prism Pairs\nIn 1968 Treacy demonstrated for the first time the use of a pair of diffraction\ngratings to achieve negative GDD [55]. In 1984 Fork et al. obtained negative\nGDD with pairs of Brewster-angled prisms [56]. Prism pairs have been widely\nused for dispersion control inside laser oscillators since they can be very low\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nFigure 3.15: Optical path difference in a two-element dispersive delay line\n[107]\nloss in contrast to grating pairs. In both optical systems the origin of the\nadjustable dispersion is the angular dispersion that arises from diffraction\nand refraction, respectively. The dispersion introduced by these systems can\nbe easily calculated, by calculating the phase accumulated between the input\nand output reference planes [78]. To understand the main properties of these\nsystems, we will refer to Fig. 3.15. The first element scatters the input beam\nwith wave vector kin and input path vector l into the direction kout. The\nbeam passes between the first and the second element and is scattered back\ninto its original direction. The phase difference by the scattered beam and\nthe reference beam without the grating is: φ(ω) = kout(ω) · l. Considering\nfree-space propagation between the two elements, we have |kout| = ω/c, and\nthe accumulated phase can be written as\nφ(ω) = ω\nc |l| cos[γ -α(ω)] = ω\nc\nD\ncos(γ) cos[γ -α(ω)]\n(3.82)\nwhere: γ is the angle between the incident wave vector and the normal\nto the first element; α is the angle of the outgoing wave vector, which is\na function of frequency; D is the spacing between the scattering elements\nalong a direction parallel to their normal. In the case of a grating pair the\nfrequency dependence of the diffraction angle α is governed by the grating\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nD\nl\nkout\nkin\nα\nγ\nγ\n\n3.7.

Using Eq.(3.82) and Eq.(3.83),\nit is possible to obtain analytic expressions for the GDD and the higher-order\ndispersion terms (for single pass):\nφ00(ω) = -\n4π2cD\nω3d2 cos3 α(ω)\n(3.84)\nφ000(ω) =\n12π2cD\nω4d2 cos3 α(ω)\nμ\n1 + 2πc sin α(ω)\nωd cos2 α(ω)\n¶\n(3.85)\nIt is evident from Eq.(3.84) that grating pairs give negative dispersion. D\nis the distance between the gratings. A disadvantage of the grating pair is\nthe diffraction loss. For a double-pass configuration the loss is typically 75%.\nAlso the bandwidth for efficient diffraction is limited.\nIn the case of a Brewster-angled prism pair\nEq.(3.82) reduces to the\nfollowing expression (for single pass) [56]:\nφ(ω) = ω\nc cp cos β(ω)\n(3.86)\nwhere cp is the distance between prism apices and β(ω) is the angle between\nthe refracted ray at frequency ω and the line joining the two apices.

NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nFigure 3.16: Prism pair for dispersion compensation. The blue wavelengths\nhave less material in the light path then the red wavelengths. Therefore, blue\nwavelengths are less delayed than red wavelength\nwhere n is the refractive index of the prism material; n0, n00 and n000 are\nrespectively, the first-, second- and third-order derivatives of n, with respect\nto wavelength. The prism-compressor has the advantage of reduced losses.\nUsing only fused silica prisms for dispersion compensation, sub-10-fs light\npulses have been generated directly from an oscillator in 1994 [79]. In 1996,\npulses with tens of microjoules energy, spectrally broadened in a gas-filled\nhollow fiber were compressed down to 10 fs using a prism compressor [48].\nBoth in the case of grating and prism pairs, negative GDD is associated with\na significant amount of higher-order dispersion, which cannot be lowered or\nadjusted independently of the desired GDD, thus limiting the bandwidth\nover which correct dispersion control can be obtained. This drawback has\nbeen only partially overcome by combining prism and grating pairs with\nthird-order dispersion of opposite sign. In this way pulses as short as 6 fs\nhave been generated in 1987 [46], and less than 5 fs in 1997 [47], by external\ncompression. This combination cannot be used for few-optical-cycle pulse\ngeneration either in laser oscillators, due to the high diffraction losses of the\ngratings, or in external compressors at high power level, due to the onset of\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nD\nE\nB\nF\nG\nH\nC\nA\nβ\nL\nBlue\nRed\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nunwanted nonlinearities in the prisms.\n3.7.4\nDispersion Compensating Mirrors\nChirped mirrors are used for the compression of high energy pulses, because\nthey provide high dispersion with little material in the beam path, thus\navoiding nonlinear effects in the compressor.\nGrating and prism compressors suffer from higher order dispersion. In\n1993 Robert Szipoecs and Ferenc Krausz [80] came up with a new idea,\nso called chirped mirrors. Laser mirrors are dielectric mirrors composed of\nalternating high and low index quarter wavelenth thick layers resulting in\nstrong Bragg-reflection. In chirped mirrors the Bragg wavelength is chirped\nso that different wavelength penetrate different depth into the mirror upon\nreflection giving rise to a wavelength dependent group delay. It turns out\nthat the generation of few-cycle pulses via external compression [95] as well\nas direct generation from Kerr lens mode-locked lasers [58] relies heavily on\nthe existence of chirped mirrors [57, 83, 59] for dispersion compensation.\nThere are two reasons to employ chirped mirrors . First the high-reflectivity\nbandwidth, ∆f, of a standard dielectric Bragg-mirror is determined by the\nFresnel reflectivity rB of the high, nH, and low, nL, index materials used for\nthe dielectric mirror\nrB = ∆f\nfc\n= nH -nL\nnH + nL\n(3.92)\nwhere fc is again the center frequency of the mirror.\nMetal mirrors are\nin general too lossy, especially when used as intracavity laser mirrors. For\nmaterial systems typically used for broadband optical coatings such as Silicon\nDioxide and Titanium Dioxide with nSiO2 = 1.48 and nTiO2 = 2.4, (these\nindexes might vary depending on the deposition technique used), a fractional\nbandwidth ∆f/fc = 0.23 can be covered. This fractional bandwidth is only\nabout a third of an octave spanning mirror ∆f/fc = 2/3. Furthermore, the\nvariation in group delay of a Bragg-mirror impacts already pulses that fill\nhalf the spectral range ∆f = 0.23fc. A way out of this dilemma was found\nby introducing chirped mirrors [57], the equivalent of chirped fiber Bragg\ngratings, which at that time were already well developed components in fiber\noptics [60]. When the Bragg wavelength of the mirror stack is varied slowly\nenough and no limitation on the number of layer pairs exists, an arbitrary\nhigh reflectivity range of the mirror can be engineered. The second reason\nfor using chirped mirrors is based on their dispersive properties due to the\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nwavelength dependent penetration depth of the light reflected from different\npositions inside the chirped multilayer structure. Mirrors are filters, and in\nthe design of any filter, the control of group delay and group delay dispersion\nis difficult. This problem is further increased when the design has to operate\nover wavelength ranges up to an octave or more.\nThe matching problem\nSeveral designs for ultra broadband dispersion\ncompensating mirrors have been developed over the last years. For disper-\nsion compensating mirrors which do not extend the high reflectivity range\nfar beyond what a Bragg-mirror employing the same materials can already\nachieve, a multi-cavity filter design can be used to approximate the desired\nphase and amplitude properties [61, 62]. For dispersion compensating mir-\nrors covering a high reflectivity range of up to ∆f/fc = 0.4 the concept of\ndouble-chirped mirrors (DCMs) has been developed [83][81]. It is based on\nthe following observations. A simple chirped mirror provides high-reflectivity\nover an arbitrary wavelength range and, within certain limits, a custom des-\nignable average group delay via its wavelength dependent penetration depth\n[73] (see Figure 3.17 (a) and (b) ). However, the group delay as a function\nof frequency shows periodic variations due to the impedance mismatch be-\ntween the ambient medium and the mirror stack, as well as within the stack\n(see Figure 3.17 b and Figure 3.18). A structure that mitigates these mis-\nmatches and gives better control of the group delay dispersion (GDD) is the\ndouble-chirped mirror (DCM) (Figure 3.17 c), in a way similar to that of an\napodized fiber Bragg grating [64].\nFigure 3.18 shows the reflectivity and group delay of several Bragg and\nchirped mirrors composed of 25 index steps, with nH = 2.5 and nL = 1.5,\nsimilar to the refractive indices of TiO2 and SiO2, which result in a Fresnel\nreflectivity of rB = 0.25. The Bragg-mirror can be decomposed in symmetric\nindex steps [83].\nThe Bragg wavenumber is defined as kB = π/(nLdL +\nnHdH), where dL and dH are the thicknesses of the low and high index layer,\nrespectively. The Bragg wavenumber describes the center wavenumber of\na Bragg mirror composed of equal index steps. In the first case, (Figure\n3.18, dash-dotted line) only the Bragg wave number is linearly chirped from\n6.8μm-1 < kB < 11μm-1 over the first 20 index steps and held constant over\nthe last 5 index steps. The reflectivity of the structure is computed assuming\nthe structure imbedded in the low index medium.\nThe large oscillations\nin the group delay are caused by the different impedances of the chirped\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nFigure 3.17:\na) Standard Bragg mirror; (b) Simple chirped mirror, (c)\nDouble-chirped mirror with matching sections to avoid residual reflections\ncausing undesired oscillations in the GD and GDD of the mirror.\ngrating and the surrounding low index material causing a strong reflection at\nthe interface of the low index material and the grating stack. By adiabatic\nmatching of the grating impedance to the low index material this reflection\ncan be avoided. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3.18 by the dashed and solid\ncurves, corresponding to an additional chirping of the high index layer over\nthe first 12 steps according to the law dH = (m/12)αλB,12/(4nH) with α = 1,\nand 2, for linear and quadratic adiabatic matching. The argument m denotes\nthe m-th index step and λB,12 = 0.740μm.\nThe strong reduction of the\noscillations in the group delay by the double-chirp technique is clearly visible.\nQuadratic tapering of the high index layer, and therefore, of the grating\nalready eliminates the oscillations in the group delay completely, which can\nalso be shown analytically by coupled mode analysis [81]. Because of the\ndouble chirp a high transmission window at the short wavelength end of the\nmirror opens up which is ideally suited for the pumping of Ti:sapphire lasers.\nSo far, the double-chirped mirror is only matched to the low index material\nof the mirror. Ideally, the matching can be extended to any other ambient\nmedium by a properly designed AR-coating. However, this AR-coating has\nto be of very high quality, i.e. very low residual reflectivity ideally a power\na\nBragg-Mirror:\nAir\nSiO2\nSubstrate\n-\nSiO2\nTiO2/SiO2\nλ1\nλ2\nλ2 > λ1\nλB- Layers\nSubstrate\n-\nSiO2\nSubstrate\nAR-\nCoating\n-\nChirped Mirror: Only Bragg-Wavelength λB Chirped\nDouble-Chirped Mirror: Bragg-Wavelength and Coupling Chirped\nImpedance-Matching Sections\nAir\ndh = λB/4\nNegative\nDispersion:\nb\nc\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nCHAPTER 3.

This is achieved in so called tilted front-side\nor back-side coated mirrors [65], [66], (Fig. 3.19 (a) and (b)). In the back-\nside coated mirror the ideal DCM structure, which is matched to the low\nindex material of the mirror is deposited on the back of a substrate made\nof the same or at least very similar low index material. The AR-coating is\ndeposited on the front of the slightly wedged substrate, so that the residual\nreflection is directed out of the beam and does not affect the dispersion\nproperties. Thus the task of the AR-coating is only to reduce the Fresnel\nlosses of the mirror at the air-substrate interface, and therefore, it is good\nenough for some applications, if the residual reflection at this interface is of\nthe order of 0.5%. However, the substrate has to be very thin in order to\nkeep the overall mirror dispersion negative, typically on the order of 200-500\nμm. Laser grade quality optics are hard to make on such thin substrates\nand the stress induced by the coating leads to undesired deformation of\nthe substrates.\nThe front-side coated mirror overcomes this shortcoming\nFigure by MIT OCW.\na\nb\nc\nWedge\nTilted-Front-Interface Mirror\nBlack-Side Coated Mirror\nBrewster Angle\nMirror\nAR-coating\nAR-coating\nDCM\nDCM\nDCM\nSubstrate\nThin wedged\nsubstrate\nSubstrate\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nby depositing the ideal DCM-structure matched to the index of the wedge\nmaterial on a regular laser grade substrate. A 100-200 μm thin wedge is\nbonded on top of the mirror and the AR-coating is then deposited on this\nwedge. This results in stable and octave spanning mirrors, which have been\nsuccessfully used in external compression experiments [69]. Both structures\ncome with limitations. First, they introduce a wedge into the beam, which\nleads to an undesired angular dispersion of the beam. This can partially\nbe compensated by using these mirrors in pairs with oppositely oriented\nwedges. The second drawback is that it seems to be impossible to make high\nquality AR-coatings over one or more than one octave of bandwidth, which\nhave less than 0.5% residual reflectivity [68], i.e. on one reflection such a\nmirror has at least 1% of loss, and, therefore, such mirrors cause high losses\ninside a laser. For external compression these losses are acceptable. A third\npossibility for overcoming the AR-coating problem is given by using the ideal\nDCM under Brewster-angle incidence, (Figure 3.19) [67]. In that case, the\nlow index layer is automatically matched to the ambient air. However, under\np-polarized incidence the index contrast or Fresnel reflectivity of a layer pair\nis reduced and more layer pairs are necessary to achieve high reflectivity.\nAlso the penetration depth into the mirror increased, so that scattering and\nother losses in the layers become more pronounced. On the other hand, such a\nmirror can generate more dispersion per bounce due to the higher penetration\ndepth. For external compression such mirrors might have advantages because\nthey can cover bandwidths much wider than one octave. This concept is\ndifficult to apply to the fabrication of curved mirrors. There is also a spatial\nchirp of the reflected beam, which may become sizeable for large penetration\ndepth and has to be removed by back reflection or an additional bounce on\nanother Brewster-angle mirror, that recombines the beam. For intracavity\nmirrors a way out of this dilemma is found by mirror pairs, which cancel the\nspurious reflections due to an imperfect AR-coating and matching structure\nin the chirped mirror [76]. Also this design has its drawbacks and limitations.\nIt requires a high precision in fabrication and depending on the bandwidth\nof the mirrors it may be only possible to use them for a restricted range of\nangles of incidence.\nDouble-chirped mirror pairs\nThere have been several proposals to increase the bandwidth of laser mirrors\nby mutual compensation of GDD oscillations [70, 71, 72] using computer\n\n3.7.

The new back-mirror comprising the quarter wave layer can\nbe reoptimized to achieve the same phase as MB with an additional π-phase\nshift over the whole octave of bandwidth.\noptimization. These early investigations resulted in a rather low reflectivity\nof less than 95% over almost half of the bandwidth considered. The ideas\nleading to the DCMs help us to show analytically that a design of DCM-\npairs covering one octave of bandwidth, i.e. 600 nm to 1200 nm, with high\nreflectivity and improved dispersion characteristics is indeed possible [76].\nUse of these mirror pairs in a Ti:sapphire laser system resulted in 5 fs pulses\nwith octave spanning spectra directly from the laser [58]. Yet, the potential\nof these pairs is by no means fully exploited.\nA DCM-Pair, see Fig. 3.20, consists of a mirror M1 and M2. Each is\ncomposed of an AR-coating and a low-index matched double-chirped back-\nmirror MB with given wavelength dependent penetration depth.

The back-mirror MB, is assumed to be\nperfectly matched to the first layer in the AR-coating, has full reflection over\nthe total bandwidth under consideration. Thus its complex reflectivity in the\nrange of interest is given by\nρb = ejφb(ω)\n(3.94)\nThe phase φb(ω) is determined by the desired group delay dispersion\nGDDb = -d2φb(ω)/dω2\n(3.95)\nup to an undetermined constant phase and group delay at the center fre-\nquency of the mirror, ωc.\nAll higher order derivatives of the phase are\ndetermined by the desired dispersion of the mirror.

With the transmission coefficient of the AR-coating\nt = |t|ejφt,\n(3.98)\nThe total phase of the reflection coefficient becomes\nφtot = 2φt + φb(ω) + φGTI\n(3.99)\nwith\nφGTI = 2 arctan\n∙\nIm{z}\n1 + Re{z}\n\n(3.100)\nHere, φt is the phase of the transmission coefficient and φGTI is the phase due\nto the Gire-Tournois interferometer created by the non-perfect AR-coating,\ni.e.\nr 6= 0, and the back-mirror MB, (Figure 3.21).\nThe phase φt of a\ngood AR-coating, i.e. |r| < 0.1, is linear and, therefore, does not introduce\nundesired oscillations into the GD and GDD. However, the phase φGTI is\nrapidly varying since φb(ω) varies over several 2π over the frequency range\nof interest due to the monotonic group delay of the back-mirror. The size\nof these oscillations scale with the quality of the AR-coating, i.e. with |r|.\nThus, the GDD oscillations are reduced with smaller residual reflectivity of\nthe AR-coating. Assuming, that the reflectivity r is real and smaller or equal\nto 0.1, the oscillations in the group delay and group delay dispersion are easily\nestimated by\nTg,GTI = dφGTI\ndω\n≈-rTgb(ω) cos[φb(ω)]\n(3.101)\nwith\nTgb(ω)\n=\n-dφb(ω)/dω,\nGDDGTI\n=\nd2φGT I\ndω2\n≈\nr\n¡\nT 2\ngb(ω) sin[φb(ω)] -GDDb cos[φb(ω)]\n¢\n(3.102)\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nThe GTI-reflections add up coherently when multiple reflections on chirped\nmirrors occur inside the laser over one round-trip, leading to pre- and post\npulses if the mode-locking mechanism is not strong enough to suppress them\nsufficiently. Experimental results indicate that a residual reflection in the\nAR-coating of r < 0.01 and smaller, depending on the number of reflections\nper round-trip, is required so that the pre- and post pulses are sufficiently\nsuppressed. This corresponds to an AR-coating with less than 10-4 residual\npower reflectivity, which can only be achieved over a very limited range, as\ndiscussed above.\nOver a limited wavelength range of 350 nm centered around 800 nm low\nresidual power reflectivities as small as 10-4 have been achieved effectively\nafter reoptimization of the AR-coating section and the double-chirped section\nto form a combined matching section of higher matching quality. For even\nlarger bandwidth, approaching an octave, a residual power reflectivity of\n10-4 is no longer possible [68]. A way out of this limitation is offered by the\nobservation, that a coherent subtraction of the pre- and post-pulses to first\norder in r is possible by reflections on a mirror pair M1 and M2, see Figure\n3.20 (a) and (b). A series of two reflections on a mirror with reflectivity\n(3.97) and on a similar mirror with an additional phase shift of π between\nthe AR-coating and the back-mirror, having a reflectivity (3.97) where z is\nreplaced by -z, leads to a coherent subtraction of the first order GTI-effects.\nThe resulting total reflectivity of the two reflections is given by the product\nof the individual complex reflectivities assuming the same AR-coating\nρtot,2 = -\nμ t\nt∗\n¶2\nei2φb(ω)1 -z∗2\n1 -z2\n(3.103)\nNow, the GTI-effects scale like the power reflectivity of the AR-coating r2\ninstead of the amplitude reflectivity r, which constitutes a tremendous im-\nprovement, since it is possible to design AR-coatings to the low index material\nSi02 of the mirror with a residual power reflectivity between 0.001 and 0.01\nwhile covering one octave of bandwidth [68]. However, there does not exist\na single physical layer which generates a phase shift of π/2 during one pas-\nsage for all frequency components contained in an octave. Still, a layer with\na quarter wave thickness at the center frequency is a good starting design.\nThen the back-mirror MB in the Mirror M2 can be reoptimized to take care\nof the deviation from a quarter wave thickness further away from the center\nfrequency, because the back-mirror acts as a highly dispersive medium where\nthe phase or group delay can be designed at will.\n\n3.7.

NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nFigure 3.23 shows in the top graph the designed reflectivity of both mir-\nrors of the pair in high resolution taking into account the absorption in the\nlayers. The graph below shows the reflectivity of the mirror, which has in ad-\ndition high transmission between 510-550 nm for pumping of the Ti:sapphire\ncrystal. Each mirror consists of 40 layer pairs of SiO2 and TiO2 fabricated\nusing ion-beam sputtering [74, 75]. Both mirror reflectivities cover more than\none octave of bandwidth from 580 nm to 1200 nm or 250 to 517 THz, with\nan average reflectivity of about 99.9% including the absorption in the layers.\nIn addition, the mirror dispersion corrects for the second and higher order\ndispersion of all intracavity elements such as the Ti:sapphire crystal and the\nthin, small angle, BaF2 wedges, for fine adjustment of the dispersion from 650\nnm to 1200 nm within the 12 bounces occurring in one roundtrip. The choice\nfor the lower wavelength boundary in dispersion compensation is determined\nand limited by the pump window of Ti:sapphire. The dispersion measure-\nment was performed using white light interferometry [77], up to about 1100\nnm because of the silicon detector roll-off. The oscillations in the group delay\nof each mirror are about 10 times larger than those of high quality DCMs\ncovering 350 nm of bandwidth [?]. However, in the average group delay of\nboth mirrors the oscillations are ideally suppressed due to cancellation by\nmore than a factor of ten. Therefore, the effective residual reflectivity of the\nmirror pair covering one octave, r2, is even smaller than that of conventional\nDCMs.\nMethods for active dispersion compensation\nVarious schemes for active pulse compression have been developed based\non the use of liquid-crystal modulators (LCM), acousto-optic modulators\n(AOM), and mechanically deformable mirrors.\nDispersion compensation using liquid crystal modulators\nA pulse\nshaping technique [84] based on the use of a LCM for pulse compression offers\nthe advantage of a large bandwidth (300-1500 nm) and in situ adaptive phase\ncontrol, see Figure3.23. In 1997 Yelin et al. [85] demonstrated an adaptive\nmethod for femtosecond pulse compression based on LCM. Strongly chirped\n80-fs pulses generated by an oscillator were sent in a 4-f pulse shaper com-\nposed of a pair of thin holographic transmission gratings. A programmable\none-dimensional LCM, placed in the Fourier plane of the shaper, was used\nas an updatable filter for pulse spectral manipulation. Pulses as short as\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nFigure 3.23: Grating Pair and LCM pulse shaper according to Weiner and\nHeritage [88].\nTo shape amplitude and phase two pulse shapers with an\namplitude and phase mask each are necessary.\n11 fs (transform-limited duration: 9 fs) have been obtained, employing an\noptimization algorithm for adaptive compression based on a search in the\ntwo-dimensional space of second- and third-order dispersion coefficients. In\n2001, Karasawa et al. [86] demonstrated pulse compression, down to 5 fs, of\nbroadband pulses from an argon-filled hollow fiber, using only a LCM for\nphase compensation. More recently [51], pulses as short as 3.8 fs have been\nachieved through a closed-loop combination of a liquid-crystal spatial light\nmodulator for adaptive pulse compression and spectral-phase interferome-\ntry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) [87] measurements as\nfeedback signal.\nOne problem of the method is pixelization in the Fourier plane owing\nto the technology of the liquid-crystal active matrix. Diffraction on pixel\nedges and absorption by the black matrix introduce parasitic effects. The re-\nquirement that the actual spectral modulation should approximate a smooth\nfunction despite the fixed, finite size of the individual modulator elements,\nlimits the temporal range over which pulse compression can be achieved [88].\nOther problems are related to the optical damage of the LCM, which limits\nthe maximum pulse energy, and to the high losses introduced by the device.\nVarious nonpixelated devices have been proposed: Dorrer et al. have re-\nported on an optically addressed LCM (liquid crystal light valve) [89]. The\nlight valve consists of two continuous transparent electrodes and continuous\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nf\nGrating\nLens\nLens\nMask\nGrating\nf\nf\nf\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nlayers of a nematic twisted liquid crystal and of photoconductive Bi12SiO20\n(BSO). A local variation of illumination of the BSO layer (in the blue green\nspectral region) induces a change in conductivity. When a voltage is applied\nbetween the two electrodes, the variation of the BSO conductivity results\nin a change in the voltage drop across the liquid crystal layer. As the bire-\nfringence of the liquid crystal is voltage dependent, a local variation of the\nrefractive index is created, which translates into a variation of the optical\nphase of the local spectral component. The light valve is addressed by using\na display device. Pixelation effects are avoided because the light valve itself\nis a continuous device. The control of the light valve is more complicated\nthan for the electrically addressed LCM. Moreover, due to its limited spatial\nfrequency response, the spectral resolution is limited.\nDispersion compensation using acousto-optic modulators\nIn 1997 Tournois proposed an acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter\n(AOPDF), to provide large dispersion-compensation ranges[91]. The device\nis based on a collinear acousto-optic interaction in a birefringent uniaxial\ncrystal, see Figure 3.24. The acoustic frequency is a variable function of time\nand provides control over the group delay of the diffracted optical pulse. At\nthe same time, the spectral amplitude of the diffracted pulse is driven by\nthe intensity of the acoustic signal. As demonstrated in Ref. [91], the optical\noutput Eout(t) of the AOPDF is proportional to the convolution of the optical\ninput, Ein(t), and the scaled acoustic signal:\nEout(t) ∝Ein(t) ⊗S(t/α)\n(3.104)\nwhere the scaling factor α = ∆n(V/c) is the ratio of the speed of sound\nto the speed of light times the index difference between the ordinary and\nthe extraordinary waves. Therefore, by generating the proper function S(t),\nit is possible to generate any arbitrary convolution with a temporal reso-\nlution given by the inverse of the filter bandwidth. Such device have been\nused in kilohertz chirped-pulse amplification laser chains compensating for\ngain narrowing and residual phase errors with the AOPDF, resulting in the\ngeneration of 17-fs transform-limited pulses [92]. The total throughput is 10-\n50%, depending on the bandwidth of the device. Devices approaching one\noctave in bandwidth are possible.\n\n3.7. PULSE COMPRESSION\nFigure 3.24: Acousto-optic programable pulse shaper. One element can shape\namplitude and phase of the pulse.\nDispersion compensation using deformable mirrors\nMechanically deformable mirrors can be used for active dispersion control,\nas proposed by Heritage et al. [93]. More recently, pulse compression has\nbeen achieved using an electrostatically deformable, gold-coated, silicon ni-\ntride membrane mirror, placed in the Fourier plane of a 4f zero-dispersion\nstretcher [94]. The membrane was suspended over an array of 39 actuator\nelectrodes. The potential applied to each actuator generates an electrostatic\nattraction between the membrane and the electrode, thus inducing a defor-\nmation of the mirror surface, which translates into a modulation of the phase\nof the spectral components of the input pulse. The total phase difference is\nφ = 2(2π)∆z/λ, where ∆z is the deflection of the mirror. The minimum\nradius of curvature of the mirror membrane is given by R = T/P, where T\nis the membrane tension and P is the maximum electrostatic pressure. This\nlimitation of the membrane curvature restricts the possibility of the mir-\nror correction of higher-order phases. The main advantages of this method\nare the following: the phase modulation is smoothly varying; reduced losses\ndue to the high reflectivity (97%) of the mirror; relatively high actuator den-\nsity. Experiments have been performed with a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser,\nwhere the deformable mirror recompressed a 15 fs pulse, previously stretched\nto 90 fs by dispersion in glass, back to approximately the bandwidth limit\n[94].\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\nRecently, dispersion control over a bandwidth of ∼220 THz has been\ndemonstrated by A. Baltuska et al. [95] using a compressor consisting of\na pair of chirped mirrors and a grating dispersion line with a computer-\ncontrolled flexible mirror positioned in the focal plane. The total throughput\nof the pulse shaper was less than 12% because of the low diffraction efficiency\nof the grating. Using this compressor, the visible-near-IR pulses, generated\nby optical parametric amplification, were compressed to a 4-fs duration.\n3.7.5\nHollow Fiber Compression Technique\nSingle mode fiber only allows compression of low energy pulses.\nIn 1996\nthe group of DeSilvestri in Milan [48] developed a technique that enables\nthe generation of few-cycle light pulses with energies in the millijoule range.\nThe technique is based on propagation of laser pulses in a hollow fiber filled\nwith noble gases (hollow fiber compression technique), see Figure 3.25.The\nmodes of the hollow fiber are leaky modes, i.e. they experience radiation loss.\nHowever, there is one mode, the EH11mode, which has considerably less loss\nthan the higher order modes. This mode is used for pulse compression. The\nnonlinear index in the fiber can be controlled with the gas pressure. Typical\nfiber diameters are 100-500 μm and typical gas pressures are in the range of\n0.1-3bar. As in the case of fiber compression it is important to consider the\noptimization of nonlinear interaction and dispersion. Both the medium and\nwaveguide dispersion has to be taken into account. For more detail see ref.\n[107].\nFigure 3.25: Hollow fiber compression technique [48]\n\n3.8.

This equation describes a Hamiltonian system. The equation\nis integrable, i.e., it does possess an infinite number of conserved quantities.\nThe equation has soliton solutions, which show complicated but persistent os-\ncillatory behavior. Especially, the fundamental soliton, a sech-shaped pulse,\nshows no dispersion which makes them ideal for long distance optical commu-\nnication. Due to the universality of the NSE, this dynamics is also extremely\nimportant for modelocked lasers once the pulses become so short that the\n\n3.9. SUMMARY\nspectra experience the dispersion and the peak powers are high enough that\nnonlinear effects become important.\nIn general, this is the case for sub-\npicosecond pulses. Further, we found a perturbation theory, which enables\nus to decompose a solution of the NSE close to a fundamental soliton as a\nfundamental soliton and continuum radiation. We showed that periodic per-\nturbations of the soliton may lead to side-band generation, if the nonlinear\nphase shift of the soliton within a period of the perturbation becomes com-\nparable to π/4. Soliton perturbation theory will also give the frame work for\nstudying noise in mode-locked lasers later.\nA medium with positive dispersion and self-phase modulation with the\nsame sign can be used for pulse compression. The major problem in pulse\ncompression is to find a compressor that can that exactly inverts the group\ndelay caused by spectral broadening. Depending on bandwith this can be\nachieved by grating, prism, chirped mirrors, puls shapers, AOPDFs or a\ncombination thereof.\n\nCHAPTER 3. NONLINEAR PULSE PROPAGATION\n\nBibliography\n[1] L.

      "content": "Chapter 4\nLaser Dynamics (single-mode)\nBefore we start to look into the dynamics of a multi-mode laser, we should\nrecall the technically important regimes of operation of a \"single-mode\" laser.\nThe term \"single-mode\" is set in apostrophes, since it doesn't have to be\nreally single-mode. There can be several modes running, for example due to\nspatial holeburning, but in an incoherent fashion, so that only the average\npower of the beam matters. For a more detailed account on single-mode\nlaser dynamics and Q-Switching the following references are recommended\n[1][3][16][4][5].\n4.1\nRate Equations\nIn section 2.5, we derived for the interaction of a two-level atom with a laser\nfield propagating to the right the equations of motion (2.171) and (2.172),\nwhich are given here again:\nμ ∂\n∂z + 1\nvg\n∂\n∂t\n¶\nA(z, t)\n=\nN~\n4T2Es\nw (z, t) A(z, t),\n(4.1)\nw\n=\n-w -w0\nT1\n+ |A(z, t)|2\nEs\nw(z, t)\n(4.2)\nwhere T1 is the energy relaxation rate, vg the group velocity in the host\nmaterial where the two level atoms are embedded, Es = IsT1, the saturation\nfluence [J/cm2] , of the medium.and Is the saturation intensity according to\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nEq.(2.145)\nIs =\n⎡\n⎢⎣2T1T2ZF\n~2\nM ˆE\n\nˆE\n\n⎤\n⎥⎦\n-1\n,\nwhich relates the saturation intensity to the microscopic parameters of the\ntransition like longitudinal and transversal relaxation rates as well as the\ndipole moment of the transition.\nFigure 4.1: Rate equations for the two-level atom\nIn many cases it is more convenient to normalize (4.1) and (4.2) to the\npopulations in level e and g or 2 and 1, respectively, N2 and N1, and the\ndensity of photons, nL, in the mode interacting with the atoms and traveling\nat the corresponding group velocity, vg, see Fig. 4.1. The intensity I in a\nmode propagating at group velocity vg with a mode volume V is related to\nthe number of photons NL stored in the mode with volume V by\nI = hfL\nNL\n2∗V vg = 1\n2∗hfLnLvg,\n(4.3)\nwhere hfL is the photon energy. 2∗= 2 for a linear laser resonator (then\nonly half of the photons are going in one direction), and 2∗= 1 for a ring\nlaser. In this first treatment we consider the case of space-independent rate\nequations, i.e. we assume that the laser is oscillating on a single mode and\npumping and mode energy densities are uniform within the laser material.\nWith the interaction cross section σ defined as\nσ =\nhfL\n2∗IsT1\n,\n(4.4)\n\n4.1. RATE EQUATIONS\nand multiplying Eq. (??) with the number of atoms in the mode, we obtain\nd\ndt(N2 -N1) = -(N2 -N1)\nT1\n-σ (N2 -N1) vgnL + Rp\n(4.5)\nNote, vgnL is the photon flux, thus σ is the stimulated emission cross section\nbetween the atoms and the photons. Rp is the pumping rate into the upper\nlaser level. A similar rate equation can be derived for the photon density\nd\ndtnL = -nL\nτ p\n+ lg\nL\nσvg\nVg\n[N2 (nL + 1) -N1nL] .\n(4.6)\nHere, τ p is the photon lifetime in the cavity or cavity decay time and the\none in Eq.(4.6) accounts for spontaneous emission which is equivalent to\nstimulated emission by one photon occupying the mode. Vg is the volume of\nthe active gain medium. For a laser cavity with a semi-transparent mirror\nwith transmission T, producing a small power loss 2l = -ln(1 -T) ≈T (for\nsmall T) per round-trip in the cavity, the cavity decay time is τ p = 2l/TR ,\nif TR = 2∗L/c0 is the roundtrip-time in linear cavity with optical length 2L\nor a ring cavity with optical length L. The optical length L is the sum of the\noptical length in the gain medium ngroup\ng\nlg and the remaining free space cavity\nlength la. Internal losses can be treated in a similar way and contribute to\nthe cavity decay time. Note, the decay rate for the inversion in the absence\nof a field, 1/T1, is not only due to spontaneous emission, but is also a result of\nnon radiative decay processes. See for example the four level system shown\nin Fig. 4.2. In the limit, where the populations in the third and first level\nare zero, because of fast relaxation rates, i.e. T32, T10 →0, we obtain\nd\ndtN2\n=\n-N2\nτ L\n-σvgN2nL + Rp\n(4.7)\nd\ndtnL\n=\n-nL\nτ p\n+ lg\nL\nσvg\nVg\nN2 (nL + 1) .\n(4.8)\nwhere τ L = T21 is the lifetime of the upper laser level. Experimentally, the\nphoton number and the inversion in a laser resonator are not\n\nCHAPTER 4.

STABILITY AND RELAXATION OSCILLATIONS\n- If the laser can be pumped strong enough, i.e. r can be made large\nenough so that the stimulated lifetime becomes as short as the cavity\ndecay time, relaxation oscillations vanish.\nThe physical reason for relaxation oscillations and later instabilities is,\nthat the gain reacts to slow on the light field, i.e. the stimulated lifetime is\nlong in comparison with the cavity decay time.\nExample: diode-pumped Nd:YAG-Laser\nλ0\n=\n1064 nm, σ = 4 · 10-20cm2, Aeff = π (100μm × 150μm) , r = 50\nτ L\n=\n1.2 ms, l = 1%, TR = 10ns\nFrom Eq.(4.4) we obtain:\nIsat\n=\nhfL\nστ L\n= 3.9kW\ncm2, Psat = IsatAeff = 1.8 W, Ps = 91.5W\nτ stim\n=\nτ L\nr = 24μs, τ p = 1μs, ωR =\ns\nτ stimτ p\n= 2 · 105s-1.\nFigure 4.4 shows the typically observed fluctuations of the output of a solid-\nstate laser with long upperstate life time of several 100 μs in the time and\nfrequency domain.\nOne can also define a quality factor for the relaxation oscillations by the\nratio of imaginary to real part of the complex eigen frequencies 4.29\nQ =\ns\n4τ L\nτ p\n(r -1)\nr2\n,\nwhich can be as large a several thousand for solid-state lasers with long\nupper-state lifetimes in the millisecond range.\n\nCHAPTER 4.

The\nlaser is pumped by a pump pulse with a length on the order of the upper-\nstate lifetime, while the intracavity losses are kept high enough, so that\nthe laser can not reach threshold. Therefore, the laser medium acts as an\nenergy storage.\nThe energy only relaxes by spontenous and nonradiative\ntransitions. Then suddenly the intracavity loss is reduced, for example by\na rotating cavity mirror. The laser is pumped way above threshold and the\nlight field builts up exponentially with the net gain until the pulse energy\ncomes close to the saturation energy of the gain medium. The gain saturates\nand is extracted, so that the laser is shut offby the pulse itself.\nKeller, U., Ultrafast Laser Physics, Institute of Quantum Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,\nETH Honggerberg--HPT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nA typical actively Q-switched pulse is asymmetric: The rise time is pro-\nportional to the net gain after the Q-value of the cavity is actively switched\nto a high value. The light intensity growths proportional to 2g0/TR. When\nthe gain is depleted, the fall time mostly depends on the cavity decay time\nτ p. For short Q-switched pulses a short cavity length, high gain and a large\nchange in the cavity Q is necessary. If the Q-switch is not fast, the pulse\nwidth may be limited by the speed of the switch. Typical electro-optical and\nacousto-optical switches are 10 ns and 50 ns, respectively\nFigure 4.6: Asymmetric actively Q-switched pulse.\nFor example, with a diode-pumped Nd:YAG microchip laser [6] using an\nelectro-optical switch based on LiTaO3 Q-switched pulses as short as 270 ps\nat repetition rates of 5 kHz, peak powers of 25 kW at an average power of\n34 mW, and pulse energy of 6.8 μJ have been generated (Figure 4.7).\nKeller, U., Ultrafast Laser Physics, Institute of Quantum Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,\nETH Honggerberg--HPT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\n\n4.4.

This mode will extract all the energy before the other\nmodes can do, see Figure 4.9\nFigure 4.9: Output intenisity of a Q-switched laser without a) and with\nseeding b).\nAnother possibility to achieve single-mode output is either using an etalon\nin the cavity or making the cavity so short, that only one longitudinal mode\nis within the gain bandwidth (Figure 4.10).

LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\n4.4.3\nTheory of Active Q-Switching\nWe want to get some insight into the pulse built-up and decay of the actively\nQ-switched pulse. We consider the ideal situation, where the loss of the laser\ncavity can be instantaneously switched from a high value to a low value, i.e.\nthe quality factor is switched from a low value to a high value, respectively\n(Figure: 4.11)\nFigure 4.11:\nAcitve Q-Switching dynamics assuming an instantaneous\nswitching [16].\nPumping Interval:\nDuring pumping with a constant pump rate Rp, proportional to the small\nsignal gain g0, the inversion is built up. Since there is no field present, the\ngain follows the simple equation:\nd\ndtg = -g -g0\nτ L\n,\n(4.33)\nor\ng(t) = g0(1 -e-t/τL),\n(4.34)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nPumping Interval\nCavity Loss\nQ-switch\nt\nLaser output\npulse\ng(t) ∝ N(t)\nI ∝ Nth(t)\nnL(t) ∝ P(t)\nNf\nNi\nPulse Output\nInterval\n\n4.4. Q-SWITCHING\nPulse Built-up-Phase:\nAssuming an instantaneous switching of the cavity losses we look for an\napproximate solution to the rate equations starting of with the initial gain\nor inversion gi = hfLN2i/(2Esat) = hfLNi/(2Esat), we can savely leave the\nindex away since there is only an upper state population. We further assume\nthat during pulse built-up the stimulated emission rate is the dominate term\nchanging the inversion. Then the rate equations simplify toτ\nd\ndtg\n=\n-gP\nEsat p\n(4.35)\nd\ndtP\n=\n2(g -l)\nTR\nP,\n(4.36)\nresulting in\ndP\ndg = 2Esat\nTR\nμ l\ng -1\n¶\n.\n(4.37)\nWe use the following inital conditions for the intracavity power P(t = 0) = 0\nand initial gain g(t = 0) = gi = r ·l. Note, r means how many times the laser\nis pumped above threshold after the Q-switch is operated and the intracavity\nlosses have been reduced to l. Then 4.37 can be directly solved and we obtain\nP(t) = 2Esat\nTR\nμ\ngi -g(t) + l ln g(t)\ngi\n¶\n.\n(4.38)\nFrom this equation we can deduce the maximum power of the pulse, since\nthe growth of the intracavity power will stop when the gain is reduced to the\nlosses, g(t)=l, (Figure 4.11)\nPmax\n=\n2lEsat\nTR\n(r -1 -ln r)\n(4.39)\n=\nEsat\nτ p\n(r -1 -ln r) .\n(4.40)\nThis is the first important quantity of the generated pulse and is shown\nnormalized in Figure 4.12.\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Assuming further, that there\nare no internal losses, then we can estimate the pulse energy generated by\nEP = (Ni -Nf) hfL.\n(4.44)\nThis is also equal to the output coupled pulse energy since no internal losses\nare assumed. Thus, if the final inversion gets small all the energy stored in\n\n4.4. Q-SWITCHING\nFigure 4.13: Energy extraction efficiency as a function of pump power.\nthe gain medium can be extracted.

Without the saturable\nabsorber these oscillations are damped. If for some reason there is two much\ngain in the system, the light field can build up quickly. Especially for a low\ngain cross section the backaction of the growing laser field on the inversion is\nweak and it can grow further. This growth is favored in the presence of loss\nthat saturates with the intensity of the light. The laser becomes unstabile,\nthe field intensity growth as long as the gain does not saturate below the net\nloss, see Fig.4.15.\n\n4.4.

Second, we\nassume that the changes in the laser intensity, gain and saturable absorption\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nare small on a time scale on the order of the round-trip time TR in the cavity,\n(i.e. less than 20%). Then, we can use the rate equations of the laser as\nderived above plus a corresponding equation for the saturable loss q similar\nto the equation for the gain.\nTR\ndP\ndt\n=\n2(g -l -q)P\n(4.49)\nTR\ndg\ndt\n=\n-g -g0\nTL\n-gTRP\nEL\n(4.50)\nTR\ndq\ndt\n=\n-q -q0\nTA\n-qTRP\nEA\n(4.51)\nwhere P denotes the laser power, g the amplitude gain per roundtrip, l the\nlinear amplitude losses per roundtrip, g0 the small signal gain per roundtrip\nand q0 the unsaturated but saturable losses per roundtrip.\nThe quanti-\nties TL = τ L/TR and TA = τ A/TR are the normalized upper-state life-\ntime of the gain medium and the absorber recovery time, normalized to\nthe round-trip time of the cavity. The energies EL = hνAeff,L/2∗σL and\nEA = hνAeff,A/2∗σA are the saturation energies of the gain and the ab-\nsorber, respectively. .\nFor solid state lasers with gain relaxation times on the order of τ L ≈100\nμs or more, and cavity round-trip times TR ≈10 ns, we obtain TL ≈104.\nFurthermore, we assume absorbers with recovery times much shorter than\nthe round-trip time of the cavity, i.e. τ A ≈1 -100 ps, so that typically\nTA ≈10-4 to 10-2. This is achievable in semiconductors and can be en-\ngineered at will by low temperature growth of the semiconductor material\n[20, 30]. As long as the laser is running cw and single mode, the absorber will\nfollow the instantaneous laser power. Then, the saturable absorption can be\nadiabatically eliminated, by using eq.(4.51)\nq =\nq0\n1 + P/PA\nwith\nPA = EA\nτ A\n,\n(4.52)\nand back substitution into eq.(4.49). Here, PA is the saturation power of\nthe absorber. At a certain amount of saturable absorption, the relaxation\noscillations become unstable and Q-switching occurs.

Inequality (4.57) has a simple physical explanation. The right hand\nside of (4.57) is the relaxation time of the gain towards equilibrium, at a\ngiven pump power and constant laser power. The left hand side is the decay\ntime of a power fluctuation of the laser at fixed gain. If the gain can not\nreact fast enough to fluctuations of the laser power, relaxation oscillations\ngrow and result in passive Q-switching of the laser.\nAs can be seen from Eq.(4.55) and Eq.(4.57), we obtain\n-2TLP dq\ndP\n\ncw\n= 2TLq0\nP\nχPL\n1 +\nP\nχPL\n\ncw\n< rs\nwith\nχ = PA\nPL\n,\n(4.60)\nwhere χ is an effective \"stiffness\" of the absorber against cw saturation.

The cw-stiffness used for the the plots is χ = 100.\nThe tendency for a laser to Q-switch increases with the product q0TL and\ndecreases if the saturable absorber is hard to saturate, i.e. χ A 1. As can be\ninferred from Fig. 4.18 and eq.(4.60), the laser can never Q-switch, i.e. the\nleft side of eq.(4.60) is always smaller than the right side, if the quantity\nMDF = 2q0TL\nχ\n< 1\n(4.61)\nis less than 1. The abbreviation MDF stands for mode locking driving force,\ndespite the fact that the expression (4.61) governs the Q-switching instabil-\nity. We will see, in the next section, the connection of this parameter with\nmode locking. For solid-state lasers with long upper state life times, already\nvery small amounts of saturable absorption, even a fraction of a percent,\nmay lead to a large enough mode locking driving force to drive the laser into\nQ-switching. Figure 4.19 shows the regions in the χ -P/PL - plane where\nQ-switching can occur for fixed MDF according to relation (4.60). The area\nabove the corresponding MDF-value is the Q-switching region. For MDF <\n1, cw-Q-switching can not occur. Thus, if a cw-Q-switched laser has to be\ndesigned, one has to choose an absorber with a MDF >1. The further the op-\neration point is located in the cw-Q-switching domain the more pronounced\nthe cw-Q-switching will be.

EXAMPLE: SINGLE MODE CW-Q-SWITCHED MICROCHIP LASERS155\n4.5\nExample: Single Mode CW-Q-Switched\nMicrochip Lasers\nQ-switched microchip lasers are compact and simple solid-state lasers, which\ncan provide a high peak power with a diffraction limited output beam. Due to\nthe extremely short cavity length, typically less than 1 mm, single-frequency\nQ-switched operation with pulse widths well below a ns can be achieved.\nPulse durations of 337 ps and 218 ps have been demonstrated with a passively\nQ-switched microchip laser consisting of a Nd:YAG crystal bonded to a thin\npiece of Cr4+:YAG [8, 9]. Semiconductor saturable absorbers were used to\npassively Q-switch a monolithic Nd:YAG laser producing 100 ns pulses [38].\n4.5.1\nSet-up of the Passively Q-Switched Microchip\nLaser\nFigure 4.23(a) shows the experimental set-up of the passively Q-switched\nmicrochip laser and Fig.\n4.23(b) the structure of the semiconductor sat-\nurable absorber [12, 13].\nThe saturable absorber structure is a so called\nanti-resonant Fabry-Perot saturable absorber (A-FPSA), because in a mi-\ncrochip laser the beam size is fixed by the thermal lens that builds up in\nthe laser crystal, when pumped with the diode laser. Thus, one can use the\ntop reflector of the A-FPSA to scale the effective saturation intensity of the\nabsorber with respect to the intracavity power. The 200 or 220 μm thick\nNd:YVO4 or Nd:LaSc3(BO3)4, (Nd:LSB) laser crystal [39] is sandwiched be-\ntween a 10% output coupler and the A-FPSA. The latter is coated for high\nreflection at the pump wavelength of 808 nm and a predesigned reflectivity\nat the laser wavelength of 1.062 μ m, respectively. The laser crystals are\npumped by a semiconductor diode laser at 808 nm through a dichroic beam-\nsplitter, that transmits the pump light and reflects the output beam at 1.064\nμm for the Nd:YVO4 or 1.062 μm for the Nd:LSB laser. To obtain short Q-\nswitched pulses, the cavity has to be as short as possible. The highly doped\nlaser crystals with a short absorption length of only about 100μm lead to a\nshort but still efficient microchip laser [13]. The saturable absorber consists\nof a dielectric top mirror and 18 pairs of GaAs/InGaAs MQW's grown on a\nGaAs/AlAs Bragg-mirror. The total optical thickness of the absorber is on\nthe order of 1 μm. Therefore, the increase of the cavity length due to the\n\nCHAPTER 4.

For more details see [12, 13]. Pulses as short as 56 ps,\nFig. (4.24), have been achieved with Nd:LSB-crystals.\n4.5.2\nDynamics of a Q-Switched Microchip Laser\nThe passively Q-switched microchip laser, shown in Fig. 4.23(a), is perfectly\nmodelled by the rate equations (4.49) to (4.51). To understand the basic\ndependence of the cw-Q-switching dynamics on the absorber parameters, we\nperformed numerical simulations of the Nd:LSB microchip laser, as shown\nin Fig. 4.23. The parameter set used, is given in Table 4.2. For these pa-\nrameters, we obtain according to eq.(4.55) a mode locking driving force of\nMDF = 685. This laser operates clearly in the cw-Q-switching regime as\nsoon as the laser is pumped above threshold. Note, the Q-switching condi-\ntion (4.61) has only limited validity for the microchip laser considered here,\nbecause, the cavity length is much shorter than the absorber recovery time.\nThus the adiabatic elimination of the absorber dynamics is actually not any\nlonger justified. Figures 4.25 and 4.26 show the numerical solution of the set\nof rate equations (4.49) to (4.51) on a microsecond timescale and a picosecond\ntimescale close to one of the pulse emission events.\nNo analytic solution to the set of rate equations is known. Therefore,\noptimization of Q-switched lasers has a long history [4, 5], which in general\nresults in complex design criteria [5], if the most general solution to the rate\n\nCHAPTER 4.

However, a careful look at the simulation results\nleads to a set of very simple design criteria, as we show in the following.\nAs seen from Fig. 4.25, the pulse repetition time Trep is many orders of\nmagnitude longer than the width of a Q-switched pulse. Thus, between two\npulse emissions, the gain increases due to pumping until the laser reaches\nthreshold.\nThis is described by eq.(4.50), where the stimulated emission\nterm can be neglected. Therfore, the pulse repetition rate is determined by\nthe relation that the gain has to be pumped to threshold again gth = l + q0,\nif it is saturated to the value gf after pulse emission. In good approximation,\ngf = l -q0, as long as it is a positive quantity. If Trep < τ L, one can linearize\nthe exponential and we obtain\ngth -gf = g0\nTrep\nτ L\n(4.68)\nTrep = τ L\ngth -gf\ng0\n= τ L\n2q0\ng0\n.\n(4.69)\nFigure 4.26 shows, that the power increases, because, the absorber saturates\nfaster than the gain.\nTo obtain a fast raise of the pulse, we assume an\nabsorber which saturates much easier than the gain, i.e. EA ¿ EL, and the\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nrecovery times of gain and absorption shall be much longer than the pulse\nwidth τ pulse, τ A A τ pulse. Since, we assume a slow gain and a slow absorber,\nwe can neglect the relaxation terms in eqs.(4.50) and (4.51) during growth\nand decay of the pulse. Then the equations for gain and loss as a function\nof the unknown Q-switched pulse shape fQ(t)\nP(t) = EPfQ(t)\n(4.70)\ncan be solved.\nThe pulse shape fQ(t) is again normalized, such that its\nintegral over time is one and EP is, therefore, the pulse energy. Analogous to\nthe derivation for the Q-switched mode locking threshold in eqs.(4.84) and\n(4.85), we obtain\nq(t)\n=\nq0 exp\n∙\n-EP\nEA\nZ t\n-inf\nfQ(t0)dt0\n\n,\n(4.71)\ng(t)\n=\ngth exp\n∙\n-EP\nEL\nZ t\n-inf\nfQ(t0)dt0\n\n.\n(4.72)\nSubstitution of these expressions into the eq.(4.49) for the laser power, and\nintegration over the pulse width, determines the extracted pulse energy. The\nresult is a balance between the total losses and the gain.\nl + qP(EP) = gP(EP)\n(4.73)\nwith\nqP(EP)\n=\nq0\n1 -exp\nh\n-EP\nEA\ni\nEP\nEA\n,\n(4.74)\ngP(EP)\n=\ngth\n1 -exp\nh\n-EP\nEL\ni\nEP\nEL\n.\n(4.75)\nBecause, we assumed that the absorber is completely saturated, we can\nset qP(EP) ≈0. Figure 4.27 shows the solution of eq.(4.73), which is the\npulse energy as a function of the ratio between saturable and nonsaturable\nlosses s = q0/l. Also approximate solutions for small and large s are shown\nas the dashed curves.\nThus, the larger the ratio between saturable and\nnonsaturable losses is, the larger is the intracavity pulse energy, which is not\n\n4.5.

If we assume, s << 1,\nthen, we can use approximately the low energy approximation\nEP = 2EL\nq0\nl + q0\n.\n(4.76)\nThe externally emitted pulse energy is then given by\nEex\nP = 2lEP = EL\n4lq0\nl + q0\n.\n(4.77)\nThus, the total extracted pulse energy is completely symmetric in the sat-\nurable and non saturable losses. For a given amount of saturable absorption,\nthe extracted pulse energy is maximum for an output coupling as large as\npossible. Of course threshold must still be reached, i.e. l + q0 < g0. Thus,\nin the following, we assume l > q0 as in Fig. 4.26. The absorber is immedi-\natelly bleached, after the laser reaches threshold. The light field growth and\nextracts some energy stored in the gain medium, until the gain is saturated\nto the low loss value l. Then the light field decays again, because the gain\nis below the loss. During decay the field can saturate the gain by a similar\namount as during build-up, as long as the saturable losses are smaller than\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nthe constant output coupler losses l, which we shall assume in the following.\nThen the pulse shape is almost symmetric as can be seen from Fig. 4.26(b)\nand is well approximated by a secant hyperbolicus square for reasons that\nwill become obvious in a moment. Thus, we assume\nfQ(t) =\n2τ P\nsech2\nμ t\nτ p\n¶\n.\n(4.78)\nWith the assumption of an explicite pulse form, we can compute the pulse\nwidth by substitution of this ansatz into eq.(4.49) and using (4.71), (4.72)\n-2TR\nτ P\ntanh\nμ t\nτ p\n¶\n= gth exp\n∙\n-EP\n2EL\nμ\n1 + tanh\nμ t\nτ p\n¶¶\n-l.\n(4.79)\nAgain, we neglect the saturated absorption. If we expand this equation up\nto first order in EP/EL and compare coefficients, we find from the constant\nterm the energy (4.77), and from the tanh-term we obtain the following\nsimple expression for the pulse width\nτ P = 2TR\nq0\n.\n(4.80)\nFor the FWHM pulse width of the resulting sech2-pulse we obtain\nτ P,FWHM = 3.5TR\nq0\n.\n(4.81)\nThus, for optimium operation of a Q-switched microchip laser, with respect\nto minimum pulse width and maximum extracted energy in the limits consid-\nered here, we obtain a very simple design criterium. If we have a maximum\nsmall signal round-trip gain g0, we should design an absorber with q0 some-\nwhat smaller than g0/2 and an output coupler with q0 < l < g0 -q0, so that\nthe laser still fullfills the cw-Q-switching condition. It is this simple opti-\nmization, that allowed us to reach the shortest pulses every generated from a\ncw-Q-switched solid-state laser. Note, for a maximum saturable absorption\nof 2 q0 = 13%, a cavity roundtip time of TR = 2.6 ps for the Nd:YVO4 laser,\none expects from (4.81) a pulse width of about τ P = 70ps, which is close to\nwhat we observed in the experiment above. We achieved pulses between 56\nand 90 ps [13]. The typical extracted pulse energies were on the order of EP\n= 0.1 - 0.2 μJ for pulses of about 60ps [13]. Using a saturation energy of\n\n4.6.

Thus, we\nhave a deviation of one order of magnitude, which clearly indicates that the\nabsorber still introduces too much of nonsaturable intracavity losses. Low-\nering of these losses should lead to μJ - 50 ps pulses from this type of a\nvery simple and cheap laser, when compared with any other pulse generation\ntechnique.\n4.6\nQ-Switched Mode Locking\nTo understand the regime of Q-switched mode locking, we reconsider the rate\nequations (4.49) to (4.51). Fig. 4.28 shows, that we can describe the laser\npower on two time scales. One is on the order of the Q-switching envelope\nand occurs on multiple round-trips in the laser cavity, T = mTR. Therefore,\nit is on the order of microseconds. The other time scale t is a short time scale\non the order of the pulse width, i.e. picoseconds. Assuming a normalized\npulse shape fn(t) for the n-th pulse such that\nZ TR/2\n-TR/2\nfn(t -nTR)dt = 1,\n(4.82)\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nwe can make the following ansatz for the laser power\nP(T, t) = EP(T)\ninf\nX\nn=-inf\nfn(t -nTR).\n(4.83)\nHere, EP(T = mTR) is the pulse energy of the m-th pulse, which only changes\nappreciably over many round-trips in the cavity. The shape of the m-th pulse,\nfm(t), is not yet of further interest. For simplicity, we assume that the mode-\nlocked pulses are much shorter than the recovery time of the absorber. In this\ncase, the relaxation term of the absorber in Eq.(4.52) can be neglected during\nthe duration of the mode-locked pulses. Since the absorber recovery time is\nassumed to be much shorter than the cavity round-trip time, the absorber\nis unsaturated before the arrival of a pulse. Thus, for the saturation of the\nabsorber during one pulse, we obtain\nq(T = mTR, t) = q0 exp\n∙\n-EP(T)\nEA\nZ t\n-TR/2\nfm(t0)dt0\n\n.\n(4.84)\nThen, the loss in pulse energy per roundtrip can be written as\nqP(T) =\nZ TR/2\n-TR/2\nfm(t)q(T = mTR, t)dt = q0\n1 -exp\nh\n-EP (T)\nEA\ni\nEP (T)\nEA\n.\n(4.85)\nEq. (4.85) shows that the saturable absorber saturates with the pulse energy\nand not with the average intensity of the laser, as in the case of cw-Q-\nswitching (4.52). Therefore, the absorber is much more strongly bleached\nat the same average power. After averaging Eqs.(4.49) and (4.50) over one\nround-trip, we obtain the following two equations for the dynamics of the\npulse energy and the gain on a coarse grained time scale T:\nTR\ndEP\ndT\n=\n2(g -l -qP(EP))EP,\n(4.86)\nTR\ndg\ndT\n=\n-g -g0\nTL\n-gEP\nEL\n.\n(4.87)\nThis averaging is allowed, because the saturation of the gain medium within\none pulse is negligible, due to the small interaction cross section of the\nsolid-state laser material.\nComparing Eqs.(4.49), (4.50) and (4.52) with\n(4.84), (4.86) and (4.87), it becomes obvious that the stability criterion (4.53)\n\n4.6. Q-SWITCHED MODE LOCKING\nalso applies to Q-switched mode locking if we replace the formula for cw-\nsaturation of the absorber (4.52) by the formula for pulsed saturation (4.85).\nThen, stability against Q-switched mode locking requires\n-2EP\ndqP\ndEP\n\ncw-mod\n< r\nTL\n\ncw-mod\n,\n(4.88)\nwith\n-2EP\ndqP\ndEP\n\ncw-mod\n= 2q0\n1 -exp\nh\n-EP\nEA\ni 3\n1 + EP\nEA\n\nEP\nEA\n.\n(4.89)\nWhen expressed in terms of the average power P = EP/TR, similar to\nEq.(4.60), we obtain\n-2TLEP\ndqP\ndEP\n\ncw-mod\n= 2TLq0\n1 -exp\nh\n-\nP\nχP PL\ni 3\n1 +\nP\nχP PL\n\nP\nχP PL\n,\n(4.90)\nwhere χP = χTA describes an effective stiffness of the absorber compared\nwith the gain when the laser is cw-mode-locked at the same average power\nas the cw laser. Thus, similar to the case of cw-Q-switching and mode locking\nit is useful to introduce the driving force for Q-switched mode locking\nQMDF = 2q0TL\nχP\n.\n(4.91)\nFigure 4.29 shows the relation (4.88) for different absorber strength. In\ngoing from Fig. 4.18 to Fig. 4.29, we used TA = 0.1. We see, that the\nshort normalized recovery time essentially leads to a scaling of the abscissa,\nwhen going from Fig. 4.18 to Fig. 4.29 while keeping all other parameters\nconstant. Comparing Eqs.(4.61) with (4.91), it follows that, in the case of\ncw-mode locking, the absorber is more strongly saturated by a factor of\n1/TA, which can easily be as large as 1000. Therefore, the Q-switched mode\nlocking driving force is much larger than the mode locking driving force,\nMDF, Accordingly, the tendency for Q-switched mode locking is significantly\nhigher than for cw Q-switching. However, now, it is much easier to saturate\nthe absorber with an average power well below the damage threshold of the\nabsorber (Fig. 4.29). Therefore, one is able to leave the regime of Q-switched\nmode locking at a large enough intracavity power.\n\nCHAPTER 4.

SUMMARY\nWe summarize our results for Q-switched mode locking in Fig.\n4.30.\nIt shows the stability boundary for Q-switched mode locking according to\neq.(4.88), for different strengths of the saturable absorber, i.e. different values\n2q0TL. One may also derive minimum critical mode locking driving force for\nself-starting modelocking of the laser MDFc due to various processes in the\nlaser [24][25][27][28]. Or, with the definition of the pulsed stiffness, we obtain\nχp,c ≤2q0TL\nMDFc\nTA.\n(4.92)\nThus, for a self-starting laser which shows pure cw-mode locking, we have to\ndesign the absorber such that its MDF is greater than this critical value. Or\nexpressed differently, the pulsed stiffness has to be smaller than the critical\nvalue χp,c, at a fixed value for the absorber strength q0. There is always\na trade-off: On one hand, the mode locking driving force has to be large\nenough for self-starting. On the other hand the saturable absorption has to\nbe small enough, so that the laser can be operated in a parameter regime\nwhere it is stable against Q-switching mode locking, see Fig. (4.30).\n4.7\nSummary\nStarting from a simple two level laser and absorber model, we characterized\nthe dynamics of solid-state lasers mode-locked and Q-switched by a saturable\nabsorber. The unique properties of solid-state laser materials, i.e. their long\nupper-state life time and their small cross sections for stimulated emission,\nallow for a separation of the laser dynamics on at least two time scales.\nOne process is the energy build-up and decay, which occurs typically on a\ntime scale of the upper state lifetime or cavity decay time of the laser. The\nother process is the pulse shaping, which occurs within several roundtrips\nin the cavity. Separating these processes, we can distinguish between the\ndifferent laser dynamics called cw-Q-switching, Q-switched mode locking and\ncw-mode locking. We found the stability boundaries of the different regimes,\nwhich give us guidelines for the design of absorbers for a given solid state\nlaser to favour one of these regimes. Semiconductor absorbers are a good\nchoice for saturable absorbers to modelock lasers, since the carrier lifetime\ncan be engineered by low temperature growth [20]. When the pulses become\nshort enough, the laser pulse saturates the absorber much more efficiently,\nwhich stabilizes the laser against undesired Q-switched mode locking. It has\n\nCHAPTER 4. LASER DYNAMICS (SINGLE-MODE)\nbeen demonstrated experimentally, that this technique can control the laser\ndynamics of a large variety of solid-state lasers, such as Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF,\nNd:YV04, [18] in the picosecond regime.\nWith semiconductor devices and soliton formation due to negative GVD\nand SPM, we can use similar semiconductor absorbers to modelock the lasers\nin the femtosecond regime [35]. The stability criteria derived here can be ap-\nplied to both picosecond and femtosecond lasers. However, the characteristics\nof the absorber dynamics may change drastically when going from picosecond\nto femtosecond pulses [36]. Especially, the saturation energy may depend not\nonly on excitation wavelength, but also on the pulsewidth. In addition there\nmay be additional loss mechanismes for the pulse, for example due to soliton\nformation there are additional filter losses of the pulse which couple to the\nenergy of the pulse via the area theorem. This has to be taken into account,\nbefore applying the theory to fs-laser systems, which will be discussed in\nmore detail later.\n\nBibliography\n[1] R. W.

      "content": "Chapter 5\nActive Mode Locking\nFor simplicity, we assume, that the laser operates in the transverse fundamen-\ntal modes and, therefore, we only have to treat the longitudinal modes of the\nlaser similar to a simple plane parallel Fabry-Perot resonator (Figure: 5.1).\nWe consider one polarization of the field only, however, as we will say later\nfor some mode-locked laser polarization dynamics will become important.\nThe task of mode-locking is to get as many of the longitudinal modes\nlasing in a phase synchronous fashion, such that the superposition of all\nmodes represents a pulse with a spatial extent much shorter than the cavity.\nThe pulse will then propagate at the group velocity corresponding to the\ncenter frequency of the pulse.\nFigure 5.1: Fabry-Perot resonator\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\n5.1\nThe Master Equation of Mode Locking\nLets consider for the moment the cold cavity (i.e. there is only a simple\nlinear medium in the cavity no lasing). The most general solution for the\nintracavity field is a superpositon of left- and rightward running waves\nE(left)(z, t) = Re\n( inf\nX\nn=0\nˆEnej(Ωnt+Knz)\n)\n,\n(5.1)\nand\nE(right)(z, t) = Re\n( inf\nX\nn=0\nˆEnej(Ωnt-Knz)\n)\n.\n(5.2)\nThe possible values for the wavenumbers are Kn = nπ/L, resulting from the\nboundary conditions on metallic mirrors or periodicity after one roundtrip in\nthe cavity. If the mirrors are perfectly reflecting, the leftward and rightward\nmoving waves Eqs.(5.1) and (5.2) contain the same information and it is\nsufficient to treat only one of them. Usually one of the cavity mirrors is\nnot perfectly reflecting in order to couple out light, however, this can be\nconsidered a perturbation to the ideal mode structure.\nWe consider the modes in Eq.(5.2) as a continuum and replace the sum\nby an integral\nE(right)(z, t) = 1\n2πRe\n1⁄2Z inf\nK=0\nˆE(K)ej(Ω(K)t-Kz)dK\n3⁄4\n(5.3)\nwith\nˆE(Km) = ˆEm2L.\n(5.4)\nEq.(5.3) is similar to the pulse propagation discussed in chapter 2 and de-\nscribes the pulse propagation in the resonator. However, here it is rather\nan initial value problem, rather than a boundary value problem. Note, the\nwavenumbers of the modes are fixed, not the frequencies. To emphasize this\neven more, we introduce a new time variable T = t and a local time frame\nt0 = t -z/υg,0, instead of the propagation distance z, where υg,0 is the group\nvelocity at the central wave number Kn0 of the pulse\nυg,0 = ∂ω\n∂k\n\nk=0\n=\nμ∂k\n∂ω\n¶-1\nω=0\n.\n(5.5)\n\n5.1. THE MASTER EQUATION OF MODE LOCKING\nFor introduction of a slowly varying envelope, we shift the frequency and\nwavenumber by the center frequency ω0 = Ωn0 and center wave number\nk0 = Kn0\nk\n=\nK -Kn0,\n(5.6)\nω(k)\n=\nΩ(Kn0 + k) -Ωn0,\n(5.7)\nˆE(k)\n=\nˆE(Kn0 + k),\n(5.8)\nThe temporal evolution of the pulse is than determined by\nE(right)(z, t) = 1\n2πRe\n(Z inf\n-Kn0→-inf\nˆE(k)ej(ω(k)t-kz)dk\n)\nej(ω0t-k0z).\n(5.9)\nAnalogous to chapter 2, we define a slowly varying field envelope, that is\nalready normalized to the total power flow in the beam\nA(z, t) =\nr\nAeff\n2Z0\n2π\nZ inf\n-inf\nˆE(k)ej(ω(k)t-kz)dk.\n(5.10)\nWith the retarded time t0 and time T, we obtain analogous to Eq. (2.184).\nA(T, t0) =\nr\nAeff\n2Z0\n2π\nZ inf\n-inf\nˆE(k)ej((ω(k)-υg,0k)T+kυg,0t0dk.\n(5.11)\nwhich can be written as\nTR\n∂A(T, t0)\n∂T\n\n(GDD)\n= j\ninf\nX\nn=2\nDn\nμ\n-j ∂n\n∂t0\n¶n\nA(T, t0),\n(5.12)\nwith the dispersion coefficients per resonator round-trip TR =\n2L\nυg,0\nDn =\n2L\nn!υn+1\ng,0\n∂n-1υg(k)\n∂kn-1\n\nk=0\n.\n(5.13)\nThe dispersion coefficients (5.13) look somewhat suspicious, however, it is\nnot difficult to show, that they are equivalent to derivatives of the roundtrip\nphase φR(Ω) = Ω\nc n(Ω)2L in the resonator at the center frequency\nDn = -1\nn!\n∂nφ(n)\nR (Ω)\n∂Ωn\n\nΩ=ω0\n,\n(5.14)\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nSofar, only the lossless resonator is treated. The gain and loss can be mod-\nelled by adding a term like\nTR\n∂A(T, t0)\n∂T\n\n(loss)\n= -lA(T, t0)\n(5.15)\nwhere l is the amplitude loss per round-trip. In an analogous manner we can\nwrite for the gain\nTR\n∂A(T, t0)\n∂T\n\n(gain)\n=\nμ\ng(T) + Dg\n∂2\n∂t02\n¶\nA(T, t0),\n(5.16)\nwhere g(T) is the gain and and Dg is the curvature of the gain at the maxi-\nmum of the Lorentzian lineshape.\nDg = g(T)\nΩ2g\n(5.17)\nDg is the gain dispersion. g(T) is an average gain, which can be computed\nfrom the rate equation valid for each unit cell in the resonator. The dis-\ntributed gain obeys the equation\n∂g(z, t)\n∂t\n= -g -g0\nτ L\n-g|A(z, t)|2\nEL\n,\n(5.18)\nwhere EL is the saturation energy EL =\nhνL\n2∗σLAeff, τ L the upper state lifetime\nand σL the gain cross section. For typical solid-state lasers, the intracavity\npulse energy is much smaller than the saturation energy. Therefore, the gain\nchanges within one roundtrip are small. Furthermore, we assume that the\ngain saturates spatially homogeneous, g(z, t0) = g(t0). Then, the equation for\nthe average gain g(T) can be found by averageing (5.18) over one round-trip\nand we obtain\n∂g(T)\n∂T\n= -g -g0\nτ L\n-gW(T)\nELTR\n,\n(5.19)\nwhere W(T) is the intracavity pulse energy at time t = T\nW(T) =\nZ TR/2\nt0=-TR/2\n|A(T, t0)|2dt0 ≈\nZ inf\n-inf\n|A(T, t0)|2dt0.\n(5.20)\n\n5.2. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING BY LOSS MODULATION\nFigure 5.2:\nActively modelocked laser with an amplitude modulator\n(Acousto-Optic-Modulator).\nTaking all effects into account, the linear ones: loss, dispersion, gain and\ngain dispersion, as well as the nonlinear ones like saturable absorption and\nself-phase modulation, we end up with the master equation of modelocking\nTR\n∂A(T, t0)\n∂T\n=\n-lA(T, t0) + j\ninf\nX\nn=2\nDn\nμ\nj ∂n\n∂t\n¶n\nA(T, t0)\n+\ng(T)\nμ\n1 + 1\nΩ2g\n∂2\n∂t02\n¶\nA(T, t0)\n(5.21)\n-\nq(T, t0)A(T, t0) -jδ|A(T, t0)|2A(T, t0).\nTo keep notation simple, we replace t0 by t again. This equation was first\nderived by Haus [4] under the assumption of small changes in pulse shape\nper round-trip and per element passed within one round-trip.\n5.2\nActive Mode Locking by Loss Modula-\ntion\nActive mode locking was first investigated in 1970 by Kuizenga and Siegman\nusing a gaussian pulse analyses, which we want to delegate to the exercises\n[3]. Later in 1975 Haus [4] introduced the master equation approach (5.21).\nWe follow the approach of Haus, because it also shows the stability of the\nsolution.\nWe introduce a loss modulator into the cavity, for example an acousto-\noptic modulator, which periodically varias the intracavity loss according to\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nFigure 5.3: Schematic representation of the master equation for an actively\nmode-locked laser.\nq(t) = M (1 -cos(ωMt)). The modulation frequency has to be very precisely\ntuned to the resonator round-trip time, ωM = 2π/TR, see Fig.5.2.\nThe\nmodelocking process is then described by the master equation\nTR\n∂A\n∂T =\n∙\ng(T) + Dg\n∂2\n∂t2 -l -M (1 -cos(ωMt))\n\nA.\n(5.22)\nneglecting GDD and SPM. The equation can be interpreted as the total pulse\nshaping due to gain, loss and modulator, see Fig.5.3.\nIf we fix the gain in Eq. (5.22) at its stationary value, what ever it might\nbe, Eq.(5.22) is a linear p.d.e, which can be solved by separation of variables.\nThe pulses, we expect, will have a width much shorter than the round-trip\ntime TR. They will be located in the minimum of the loss modulation where\nthe cosine-function can be approximated by a parabola and we obtain\nTR\n∂A\n∂T =\n∙\ng -l + Dg\n∂2\n∂t2 -Mst2\n\nA.\n(5.23)\nMs is the modulation strength, and corresponds to the curvature of the loss\nmodulation in the time domain at the minimum loss point\nDg\n=\ng\nΩ2g\n,\n(5.24)\nMs\n=\nMω2\nM\n.\n(5.25)\nKeller, U., Ultrafast Laser Physics, Institute of Quantum Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,\nETH Honggerberg--HPT, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\n\n5.2. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING BY LOSS MODULATION\nThe differential operator on the right side of (5.23) corresponds to the Schrodinger-\nOperator of the harmonic oscillator problem. Therefore, the eigen functions\nof this operator are the Hermite-Gaussians\nAn(T, t)\n=\nAn(t)eλnT/TR,\n(5.26)\nAn(t)\n=\ns\nWn\n2n√πn!τ a\nHn(t/τ a)e\n-t2\n2τ2a ,\n(5.27)\nwhere τ a defines the width of the Gaussian. The width is given by the fourth\nroot of the ratio between gain dispersion and modulator strength\nτ a =\n4q\nDg/Ms.\n(5.28)\nNote, from Eq. (5.26) we can follow, that the gain per round-trip of each\neigenmode is given by λn (or in general the real part of λn), which are given\nby\nλn = gn -l -2Msτ 2\na(n + 1\n2).\n(5.29)\nThe corresponding saturated gain for each eigen solution is given by\ngn =\n1 +\nWn\nPLTR\n,\n(5.30)\nwhere Wn is the energy of the corresponding solution and PL = EL/τ L the\nsaturation power of the gain. Eq. (5.29) shows that for given g the eigen\nsolution with n = 0, the ground mode, has the largest gain per roundtrip.\nThus, if there is initially a field distribution which is a superpostion of all\neigen solutions, the ground mode will grow fastest and will saturate the gain\nto a value\ngs = l + Msτ 2\na.\n(5.31)\nsuch that λ0 = 0 and consequently all other modes will decay since λn < 0 for\nn ≥1. This also proves the stability of the ground mode solution [4]. Thus\nactive modelocking without detuning between resonator round-trip time and\nmodulator period leads to Gaussian steady state pulses with a FWHM pulse\nwidth\n∆tFWHM = 2 ln 2τ a = 1.66τ a.\n(5.32)\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nThe spectrum of the Gaussian pulse is given by\nA0(ω)\n=\nZ inf\n-inf\nA0(t)eiωtdt\n(5.33)\n=\nq√πWnτ ae-(ωτa)2\n,\n(5.34)\nand its FWHM is\n∆fFWHM = 1.66\n2πτ a\n.\n(5.35)\nTherfore, the time-bandwidth product of the Gaussian is\n∆tFWHM · ∆fFWHM = 0.44.\n(5.36)\nThe stationary pulse shape of the modelocked laser is due to the parabolic\nloss modulation (pulse shortening) in the time domain and the parabolic\nfiltering (pulse stretching) due to the gain in the frequency domain, see Figs.\n5.4 and 5.5. The stationary pulse is achieved when both effects balance.\nSince external modulation is limited to electronic speed and the pulse width\ndoes only scale with the inverse square root of the gain bandwidth actively\nmodelocking typically only results in pulse width in the range of 10-100ps.\nFigure 5.4: (a) Loss modulation gives pulse shortening in each roundtrip\n\n5.2. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING BY LOSS MODULATION\nFigure 5.5: (b) the finite gain bandwidth gives pulse broadening in each\nroundtrip. For a certain pulse width there is balance between the two pro-\ncesses.\nFor example: Nd:YAG; 2l = 2g = 10%, Ωg = π∆fFWHM = 0.65 THz,\nM = 0.2, fm = 100 MHz, Dg = 0.24 ps2, Ms = 4 · 1016s-1, τ p ≈99 ps.\nWith the pulse width (5.28), Eq.(5.31) can be rewritten in several ways\ngs = l + Msτ 2\na = l + Dg\nτ 2a\n= l + 1\n2Msτ 2\na + 1\nDg\nτ 2a\n,\n(5.37)\nwhich means that in steady state the saturated gain is lifted above the loss\nlevel l, so that many modes in the laser are maintained above threshold.\nThere is additional gain necessary to overcome the loss of the modulator due\nto the finite temporal width of the pulse and the gain filter due to the finite\nbandwidth of the pulse. Usually\ngs -l\nl\n= Msτ 2\na\nl\n¿ 1,\n(5.38)\nsince the pulses are much shorter than the round-trip time and the stationary\npulse energy can therefore be computed from\ngs =\n1 +\nWs\nPLTR\n= l.\n(5.39)\n\nCHAPTER 5.

This process seeds and\ninjection locks neighboring modes.\nThe name modelocking originates from studying this pulse formation process\nin the frequency domain. Note, the term\n-M [1 -cos(ωMt)] A\ndoes generate sidebands on each cavity mode present according to\n-M [1 -cos(ωMt)] exp(jωn0t)\n=\n-M\n∙\nexp(jωn0t) -1\n2 exp(j(ωn0t -ωMt)) -1\n2 exp(j(ωn0t + ωMt))\n\n=\nM\n∙\n-exp(jωn0t) + 1\n2 exp(jωn0-1t) + 1\n2 exp(jωn0+1t)\n\nif the modulation frequency is the same as the cavity round-trip frequency.\nThe sidebands generated from each running mode is injected into the neigh-\nboring modes which leads to synchronisation and locking of neighboring\nmodes, i.e. mode-locking, see Fig.5.6\n5.3\nActive Mode-Locking by Phase Modula-\ntion\nSide bands can also be generated by a phase modulator instead of an am-\nplitude modulator. However, the generated sidebands are out of phase with\n\n5.4. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING WITH ADDITIONAL SPM\nthe carrier, which leads to a chirp on the steady state pulse. We can again\nuse the master equation to study this type of modelocking. All that changes\nis that the modulation becomes imaginary, i.e. we have to replace M by jM\nin Eq.(5.22)\nTR\n∂A\n∂T =\n∙\ng(T) + Dg\n∂2\n∂t2 -l -jM (1 -cos(ωMt))\n\nA.\n(5.40)\nThe imaginary unit can be pulled through much of the calculation and we\narrive at the same Hermite Gaussian eigen solutions (5.26,5.27), however, the\nparameter τ a becomes τ 0\na and is now complex and not quite the pulse width\nτ 0\na =\n4p\n-j\n4q\nDg/Ms.\n(5.41)\nThe ground mode or stationary solution is given by\nA0(t) =\ns\nWs\n2n√πn!τ 0a\ne\n-t2\n2τ2a\n√\n2(1+j),\n(5.42)\nwith τ a =\n4p\nDg/Ms as before. We end up with chirped pulses. How does\nthe pulse shortening actually work, because the modulator just puts a chirp\non the pulse, it does actually not shorten it? One can easily show, that if a\nGaussian pulse with chirp parameter β\nA0(t) ∼e\n-t2\n2τ2a\n√\n2(1+jβ),\n(5.43)\nhas a chirp β > 1, subsequent filtering is actually shortening the pulse.\n5.4\nActive Mode Locking with Additional SPM\nDue to the strong focussing of the pulse in the gain medium also additional\nself-phase modulation can become important. Lets consider the case of an\nactively mode-locked laser with additional SPM, see Fig. 5.7. One can write\ndown the corresponding master equation\nTR\n∂A\n∂T =\n∙\ng(T) + Dg\n∂2\n∂t2 -l -Mst2 -jδ|A|2\n\nA.\n(5.44)\nUnfortunately, there is no analytic solution to this equation. But it is not\ndifficult to guess what will happen in this case. As long as the SPM is not\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nFigure 5.7: Active mode-locking with SPM\nexcessive, the pulses will experience additional self-phase modulation, which\ncreates a chirp on the pulse. Thus one can make an ansatz with a chirped\nGaussian similar to (5.43) for the steady state solution of the master equation\n(5.44)\nA0(t) = Ae\n-t2\n2τ2a (1+jβ)+jΨT/TR\n(5.45)\nNote, we allow for an additional phase shift per roundtrip Ψ, because the\nadded SPM does not leave the phase invariant after one round-trip. This is\nstill a steady state solution for the intensity envelope.

The SPM occuring in the gain\nmedium for very short pulses drives the modelocking unstable. Additional\nstabilization measures have to be adopted.\nFor example the addition of\nnegative group delay dispersion might lead to stable soliton formation in the\npresence of the active modelocker.\n5.5\nActive Mode Locking with Soliton For-\nmation\nExperimental results with fiber lasers [8, 9, 11] and solid state lasers [10]\nindicated that soliton shaping in the negative GDD regime leads to pulse\nstabilization and considerable pulse shorting. With sufficient negative dis-\npersion and self-phase modulation in the system and picosecond or even\nfemtosecond pulses, it is possible that the pulse shaping due to GDD and\nSPM is much stronger than due to modulation and gain filtering, see Fig.\n5.8.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\n5.5.1\nStability Condition\nWe want to show, that a stable soliton can exist in the presence of the\nmodelocker and gain dispersion if the ratio between the negative GDD and\ngain dispersion is sufficiently large. From (5.61) we obtain the equations of\nmotion for the soliton parameters and the continuum by carrying out the\nscalar product with the corresponding adjoint functions. Specifically, for the\nsoliton energy we get\nTR\n∂W\n∂T\n=\nμ\ng -l -\ng\n3Ω2gτ 2 -π2\n24Mω2\nMτ 2\n¶\nW\n(5.63)\n+ <\nf(+)\nw |Rac > .\nWe see that gain saturation does not lead to a coupling between the soliton\nand the continuum to first order in the perturbation, because they are or-\nthogonal to each other in the sense of the scalar product (3.36). This also\nmeans that to first order the total field energy is contained in the soliton.\nThus to zero order the stationary soliton energy W0 = 2A2\n0τ is determined\nby the condition that the saturated gain is equal to the total loss due to the\nlinear loss l, gain filtering and modulator loss\ng -l = π2\n24Mω2\nMτ 2 +\ng\n3Ω2gτ 2\n(5.64)\nwith the saturated gain\ng =\ng0\n1 + W0/EL\n.\n(5.65)\nLinearization around this stationary value gives for the soliton perturbations\n\n5.5.

First, the modelocker leads to a restoring force in the timing of the\nsoliton (5.69). Second, the gain dispersion and the active modelocker lead to\ncoupling between the perturbed soliton and the continuum which results in\na steady excitation of the continuum.\nHowever, as we will see later, the pulse width of the soliton, which can be\nstabilized by the modelocker, is not too far from the Gaussian pulse width\nby only active mode locking. Then relation\nωMτ ¿ 1 ¿ Ωgτ\n(5.71)\nis fulfilled. The weak gain dispersion and the weak active modelocker only\ncouples the soliton to the continuum, but to first order the continuum does\nnot couple back to the soliton. Neglecting higher order terms in the matrix\nelements of eq.(5.70) [6] results in a decoupling of the soliton perturbations\nfrom the continuum in (5.66) to (5.70). For a laser far above threshold, i.e.\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nW0/EL >> 1, gain saturation always stabilizes the amplitude perturbation\nand eqs.(5.67) to (5.69) indicate for phase, frequency and timing fluctuations.\nThis is in contrast to the situation in a soliton storage ring where the laser\namplifier compensating for the loss in the ring is below threshold [14].\nBy inverse Fourier transformation of (5.70) and weak coupling, we obtain\nfor the associated function of the continuum\nTR\n∂G\n∂T =\n∙\ng -l + jΦ0 + g\nΩ2g\n(1 -jDn) ∂2\n∂t2\n-M (1 -cos(ωMt))\n\nG + F-1\n1⁄2\n< f(+)\nk\n|Ra0(x) >\n(5.72)\n-< f(+)\nk\n|MωM sin(ωMτx)a0(x) > ∆t\n3⁄4\nwhere Dn is the dispersion normalized to the gain dispersion\nDn = |D|Ω2\ng/g.\n(5.73)\nNote, that the homogeneous part of the equation of motion for the continuum,\nwhich governs the decay of the continuum, is the same as the homogeneous\npart of the equation for the noise in a soliton storage ring at the position\nwhere no soliton or bit is present [14]. Thus the decay of the continuum is\nnot affected by the nonlinearity, but there is a continuous excitation of the\ncontinuum by the soliton when the perturbing elements are passed by the\nsoliton. Thus under the above approximations the question of stability of\nthe soliton solution is completely governed by the stability of the continuum\n(5.72).\nAs we can see from (5.72) the evolution of the continuum obeys\nthe active mode locking equation with GVD but with a value for the gain\ndetermined by (5.64). In the parabolic approximation of the cosine, we obtain\nagain the Hermite Gaussians as the eigensolutions for the evolution operator\nbut the width of these eigensolutions is now given by\nτ c = τ a\n4p\n(1 -jDn)\n(5.74)\nand the associated eigenvalues are\nλm = jΦ0 + g -l -Mω2\nMτ 2\na\np\n(1 -jDn)(m + 1\n2).\n(5.75)\n\n5.5.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nFigure 5.9: Pulsewidth reduction as a function of normalized dispersion.\nBelow Dn,crit = 0.652 no stable soliton can be formed.\nFigure 5.9 shows the maximum pulse width reduction R allowed by the\nstability criterion (5.78) as a function of the normalized dispersion. The crit-\nical value for the pulse width reduction is Rcrit ≈1.2. For large normalized\ndispersion Fig. 1 shows that the soliton can be kept stable at a pulse width\nreduced by up to a factor of 5 when the normalized dispersion can reach a\nvalue of 200. Even at a moderate negative dispersion of Dn = 5, we can\nachieve a pulsewidth reduction by a factor of 2. For large normalized disper-\nsion the stability criterion (5.78) approaches asymptotically the behavior\nξ <\nr\n9Dn\nor\nR < 1.66\n1.76\nr\n9Dn\n2 .\n(5.81)\nThus, the possible pulse-width reduction scales with the fourth root of the\nnormalized dispersion indicating the need of an excessive amount of disper-\nsion necessary to maintain a stable soliton while suppressing the continuum.\nThe physical reason for this is that gain filtering and the active modelocker\ncontinuously shed energy from the soliton into the continuum. For the soli-\nton the action of GVD and SPM is always in balance and maintains the\npulse shape. However, as can be seen from (5.72), the continuum, which can\nbe viewed as a weak background pulse, does not experience SPM once it is\ngenerated and therefore gets spread by GVD. This is also the reason why\nthe eigenstates of the continuum consist of long chirped pulses that scale\nKaertner, F., D. Kopf, and U.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING WITH SOLITON FORMATION\nalso with the fourth root of the dispersion (5.74). Then, the long continuum\npulses suffer a much higher loss in the active modulator in contrast to the\nshort soliton which suffers reduced gain when passing the gain medium due\nto its broader spectrum. The soliton is stable as long as the continuum sees\nless roundtrip gain than the soliton.\nIn principle by introducing a large amount of negative dispersion the\ntheory would predict arbitrarily short pulses. However, the master equation\n(5.55) only describes the laser system properly when the nonlinear changes of\nthe pulse per pass are small. This gives an upper limit to the nonlinear phase\nshift Φ0 that the soliton can undergo during one roundtrip. A conservative\nestimation of this upper limit is given with Φ0 = 0.1. Then the action of\nthe individual operators in (5.55) can still be considered as continuous. Even\nif one considers larger values for the maximum phase shift allowed, since in\nfiber lasers the action of GVD and SPM occurs simultaneously and therefore\neq.(5.55) may describe the laser properly even for large nonlinear phase shifts\nper roundtrip, one will run into intrinsic soliton and sideband instabilities for\nΦ0 approaching 2π [30, 31]. Under the condition of a limited phase shift per\nroundtrip we obtain\nτ 2 = |D|\nΦ0\n.\n(5.82)\nThus from (5.32), the definition of ξ, (5.81) and (5.82) we obtain for the\nmaximum possible reduction in pulsewidth\nRmax = 1.66\n1.76\ns\n(9Φ0/2)2\nDg Ms\n(5.83)\nand therefore for the minimum pulsewidth\nτ min =\ns\n2D2g\n9Φ0 Ms\n.\n(5.84)\nThe necessary amount of normalized negative GVD is then given by\nDn = 2\ns\n(9Φ0/2)2\nDg Ms\n.\n(5.85)\nEqs.(5.83) to (5.85) constitute the main results of this paper, because they\nallow us to compute the possible pulse width reduction and the necessary\n\nCHAPTER 5.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING WITH SOLITON FORMATION\nnegative GVD for a given laser system. Table (5.1) shows the evaluation of\nthese formulas for several gain media and typical laser parameters.\nTable 5.1 shows that soliton formation in actively mode-locked lasers may\nlead to considerable pulse shortening, up to a factor of 10 in Ti:sapphire. Due\nto the 12th root in (5.83) the shortening depends mostly on the bandwidth\nof the gain material which can change by several orders of magnitude for the\ndifferent laser materials. The amount of negative dispersion for achieving this\nadditional pulse shortening is in a range which can be achieved by gratings,\nGires-Tournois interferometers, or prisms.\nOf course, in the experiment one has to stay away from these limits\nto suppress the continuum sufficiently. However, as numerical simulations\nshow, the transition from stable to instable behaviour is remarkably sharp.\nThe reason for this can be understood from the structure of the eigenvalues\nfor the continuum (5.76). The time scale for the decay of transients is given\nby the inverse of the real part of the fundamental continuum mode which\ndiverges at the transition to instability. Nevertheless, a good estimate for\nthis transient time is given by the leading term of the real part of (5.76)\nτ trans\nTR\n=\nRe{λ0} ≈\np\nDgMsR2\n(5.86)\nThis transient time is also shown in Table (5.1) for different laser systems.\nThus these transients decay, if not too close to the instability border, on time\nscales from approximately 1,000 up to some 100,000 roundtrips, depending\nstrongly on the gain bandwidth and modulation strength. Consequently, to\nfirst order the eigenvalues of the continuum modes, which are excited by the\nright hand side of (5.72), are purely imaginary and independent of the mode\nnumber, i.e. λn ≈jΦ0. Therefore, as long as the continuum is stable, the\nsolution to (5.72) is given by\nG(x)\n=\n-j\nΦ0\nF-1\n1⁄2\n< f(+)\nk\n|Ra0(x) >\n-\nMsτ 2 < f(+)\nk\n|xa0(x) > ∆t\nτ\n3⁄4\n.\n(5.87)\nThus, in steady state the continuum is on the order of\n|G(x)| ≈A0\nΦ0\nDg\nτ 2 = A0\nDn\n.\n(5.88)\n\nCHAPTER 5. ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nwhich demonstrates again the spreading of the continuum by the dispersion.\nEquation (5.88) shows that the nonlinear phase shift of the solitary pulse\nper round trip has to be chosen as large as possible. This also maximizes\nthe normalized dispersion, so that the radiation shed from the soliton into\nthe continuum changes the phase rapidly enough such that the continuum\nin steady state stays small. Note that the size of the generated continuum\naccording to (5.88) is rather independent of the real part of the lowest eigen-\nvalue of the continuum mode. Therefore, the border to instability is very\nsharply defined. However, the time scale of the transients at the transition\nto instability can become arbitrarily long. Therefore, numerical simulations\nare only trustworthy if the time scales for transients in the system are known\nfrom theoretical considerations as those derived above in (5.86). The simu-\nlation time for a given laser should be at least of the order of 10 times τ trans\nor even longer, if operated close to the instability point, as we will see in the\nnext section.\n5.5.2\nNumerical simulations\nTable 5.1 shows that soliton formation in actively mode-locked lasers may\nlead to considerable pulse shortening, up to a factor of 10 in Ti:sapphire. We\nwant to illustrate that at the example of a Nd:YAG laser, which is chosen\ndue to its moderate gain bandwidth, and therefore, its large gain dispersion.\nThis will limit the pulsewidth reduction possible to about 3, but the decay\ntime of the continuum (5.86) (see also Table 5.1) is then in a range of 700\nroundtrips so that the steady state of the mode-locked laser can be reached\nwith moderate computer time, while the approximations involved are still\nsatisfied. The system parameters used for the simulation are shown in table\n5.2. For the simulation of eq.(5.55) we use the standard split-step Fourier\ntransform method. Here the discrete action of SPM and GDD per roundtrip\nis included by choosing the integration step size for the T integration to be\nthe roundtrip time TR.\nWe used a discretisation of 1024 points over the\nbandwidth of 1THz, which corresponds to a resolution in the time domain\nof 1ps. The following figures, show only one tenth of the simulated window\nin time and frequency.\nFigure 5.10 shows the result of the simulation starting with a 68-ps-long\nGaussian pulse with a pulse energy of W = 40 nJ for Dn = 24, i.e. D = -17\nps2.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING\nlaser should be in steady state again with a FWHM pulsewidth of 24 ps.\nFig. 5.10 shows the pulse evolution over the first thousand round-trips, i.e.\n4μs real time. The long Gaussian pulse at the start contains an appreciable\namount of continuum. The continuum part of the solution does not experi-\nence the nonlinear phase shift due to SPM in contrast to the soliton. Thus\nthe soliton interferes with the continuum periodically with the soliton period\nof Tsoliton/TR = 2π/φ0 = 20π. This is the reason for the oscillations of the\npulse amplitude seen in Fig. 5.10 which vanish with the decay of the con-\ntinuum. Note also that the solitary pulse is rapidly formed, due to the large\nnonlinear phase shift per roundtrip. Figure 5.11 shows the simulation in time\nand frequency domain over 10,000 roundtrips. The laser reaches steady state\nafter about 4,000 roundtrips which corresponds to 6 × τ trans and the final\npulsewidth is 24 ps in exact agreement with the predictions of the analytic\nformulas derived above.\nLower normalized dispersion of Dn = 15 or D = -10 ps2 only allows for\na reduction in pulsewidth by R = 2.68. However, using the same amount of\nSPM as before we leave the range of stable soliton generation.\n\n5.5.

ACTIVE MODE LOCKING WITH SOLITON FORMATION\nFigure 5.12(a) shows similar to Fig. 5.10 the first 1, 000 roundtrips in\nthat case. Again the solitary pulse is rapidly formed out of the long Gaussian\ninitial pulse. But in contrast to the situation in Fig. 5.10, the continuum does\nnot any longer decay on this time scale. The dispersion is too low to spread\nthe continuum rapidly enough. The continuum then accumulates over many\nroundtrips as can be seen from Fig. 5.12(b). After about 10,000 roundtrips\nthe continuum has grown so much that it extracts an appreciable amount of\nenergy from the soliton. But surprisingly the continuum modes stop growing\nafter about 30,000 roundtrips and a new quasi stationary state is reached.\n5.5.3\nExperimental Verification\nThe theory above explains very well the ps Ti:saphire experiments [10] in\nthe regime where the pulses are stabilized by the active modelocker alone.\nGires-Tournois interferometers were used to obtain large amounts of negative\nGDD to operate the laser in the stable soliton regime derived above. Here\nwe want to discuss in more detail the experimental results obtained recently\nwith a regeneratively, actively mode-locked Nd:glass laser [7], resulting in 310\nfs. If SPM and GVD could be neglected, the weak modelocker would produce\nGaussian pulses with a FWHM of τ a,FWHM = 10 ps. However, the strong\nSPM prevents stable pulse formation. The negative dispersion available in\nthe experiment is too low to achieve stable soliton formation, because the\npulse width of the soliton at this power level is given by τ = 4|D|/(δW) =\n464 fs, for the example discussed. The normalized dispersion is not large\nenough to allow for such a large pulse width reduction. Providing enough\nnegative dispersion results in a 310 fs perfectly sech-shaped soliton-like pulse\nas shown in Fig. 5.13. A numerical simulation of this case would need millions\nof roundtrips through the cavity until a stationary state is reached. That\nmeans milliseconds of real time, but would necessitate days of computer\ntime. Also the transition to instable behaviour has been observed, which is\nthe characteristic occurence of a short solitary fs-pulse together with a long\nps-pulse due to the instable continuum as we have found in the numerical\nsimulation for the case of a Nd:YAG laser (see Fig. 5.12(b)). Figure 5.14\nshows the signal of a fast detector diode on the sampling oscilloscope. The\ndetector has an overall bandwidth of 25GHz and therefore can not resolve\nthe fs-pulse, but can resolve the width of the following roughly 100ps long\npulse.\n\nCHAPTER 5.

SUMMARY\n5.6\nSummary\nThe main result of this section is, that pure active mode-locking with an\namplitude modulator leads to Gaussian pulses. The width is inverse propor-\ntional to the square root of the gain bandwdith. A phase modulator leads\nto chirped Gaussian pulses. A soliton much shorter than the Gaussian pulse\ndue to pure active mode locking can be stabilized by an active modelocker.\nThis finding also has an important consequence for passive mode locking. It\nimplies that a slow saturable absorber, i.e. an absorber with a recovery time\nmuch longer than the width of the soliton, is enough to stabilize the pulse,\ni.e. to modelock the laser.\n\nCHAPTER 5.

ACTIVE MODELOCKING WITH DETUNING\n5.7\nActive Modelocking with Detuning\nSo far, we only considered the case of perfect synchronism between the round-\ntrip of the pulse in the cavity and the external modulator.\nTechnically,\nsuch perfect synchronism is not easy to achieve. One way would be to do\nregenerative mode locking, i.e. a part of the output signal of the modelocked\nlaser is detected, the beatnote at the round-trip frequency is filtered out from\nthe detector, and sent to an amplifier, which drives the modulator. This\nprocedure enforces synchronism if the cavity length undergoes fluctuations\ndue to acoustic vibrations and thermal expansion.\nNevertheless, it is interesting to know how sensitive the system is against\ndetuning between the modulator and the resonator. It turns out that this\nis a physically and mathematically rich situation, which applies to many\nother phenomena occuring in externally driven systems, such as the transi-\ntion from laminar to turbulent flow in hydrodynamics. This transition has\npuzzled physicists for more than a hundred years [1]. During the last 5 to\n10 years, a scenario for the transition to turbulence has been put forward\nby Trefethen and others [2]. This model gives not only a quantitative de-\nscription of the kind of instability that leads to a transition from laminar,\ni.e. highly ordered dynamics, to turbulent flow, i.e. chaotic motion, but also\nan intuitive physical picture why turbulence is occuring. Such a picture is\nthe basis for many laser instabilities especially in synchronized laser systems.\nAccording to this theory, turbulence is due to strong transient growth of\ndeviations from a stable stationary point of the system together with a non-\nlinear feedback mechanism. The nonlinear feedback mechanism couples part\nof the amplified perturbation back into the initial perturbation. Therefore,\nthe perturbation experiences strong growth repeatedly. Once the transient\ngrowth is large enough, a slight perturbation from the stable stationary point\nrenders the system into turbulence. Small perturbations are always present\nin real systems in the form of system intrinsic noise or environmental noise\nand, in computer simulations, due to the finite precision. The predictions\nof the linearized stability analysis become meaningless in such cases. The\ndetuned actively modelocked laser is an excellent example of such a system,\nwhich in addition can be studied analytically. The detuned case has been\nonly studied experimentally [3][4] or numerically [5] so far. Here, we con-\nsider an analytical approach. Note, that this type of instability can not be\ndetected by a linear stability analysis which is widely used in laser theories\nand which we use in this course very often to prove stable pulse formation.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nOne has to be aware that such situations may arise, where the results of a\nlinearized stability analysis have only very limited validity.\nThe equation of motion for the pulse envelope in an actively modelocked\nlaser with detuning can be writen as\nTM\n∂A(T, t)\n∂T\n=\n∙\ng(T) -l + Df\n∂2\n∂t2\n(5.89)\n-M (1 -cos(ωMt)) + Td\n∂\n∂t\n\nA(T, t).\nHere, A(T, t) is the pulse envelope as before. There is the time T which is\ncoarse grained on the time scale of the resonator round-trip time TR and\nthe time t, which resolves the resulting pulse shape. The saturated gain is\ndenoted by g(T) and left dynamical, because we no longer assume that the\ngain and field dynamics reaches a steady state eventually. The curvature of\nthe intracavity losses in the frequency domain, which limit the bandwidth of\nthe laser, is given by Df .and left fixed for simplicity. M is the depth of the\nloss modulation introduced by the modulator with angular frequency ωM =\n2π/TM, where TM is the modulator period. Note that Eq.(5.89) describes the\nchange in the pulse between one period of modulation. The detuning between\nresonator round-trip time and the modulator period is Td = TM -TR.This\ndetuning means that the pulse hits the modulator with some temporal off-set\nafter one round-trip, which can be described by adding the term Td\n∂\n∂tA in the\nmaster equation.The saturated gain g obeys a separate ordinary differential\nequation\n∂g(T)\n∂T\n= -g(T) -g0\nτ L\n-gW(T)\nPL\n.\n(5.90)\nAs before, g0 is the small signal gain due to the pumping, PL the saturation\npower of the gain medium, τ L the gain relaxation time and W(T) =\nR\n|A(T, t)|2 dt the total field energy stored in the cavity at time T.\nAs before, we expect pulses with a pulse width much shorter than the\nround-trip time in the cavity and we assume that they still will be placed\nin time near the position where the modulator introduces low loss (Figure\n5.15), so that we can still approximate the cosine by a parabola\nTM\n∂A\n∂T =\n∙\ng -l + Df\n∂2\n∂t2 -Mst2 + Td\n∂\n∂t\n\nA.\n(5.91)\n\n5.7. ACTIVE MODELOCKING WITH DETUNING\nFigure 5.15: Drifting pulse dynamics in a detuned actively modelocked laser\nfor the situation, where the modulator period is larger than the cavity round-\ntrip time. The displacement A is caused by the mismatch between the cavity\nround-trip time and the modulator period. The displacement B is due to\nunequal losses experienced by the front and the back of the pulse in the\nmodulator. The gain saturates to a level where a possible stationary pulse\nexperiences no net gain or loss, which opens up a net gain window following\nthe pulse.\nPerturbations within that window get amplified while drifting\ntowards the stationary pulse.\nHere, Ms = Mω2\nM/2 is the curvature of the loss modulation at the point\nof minimum loss as before. The time t is now allowed to range from -infto\n+inf, since the modulator losses make sure that only during the physically\nallowed range -TR/2 ¿ t ¿ TR/2 radiation can build up.\nIn the case of vanishing detuning, i.e. Td = 0, the differential operator\non the right side of (5.91), which generates the dynamics and is usually\ncalled a evolution operator ˆL, correspondes to the Schrodinger operator of\nthe harmonic oscillator. Therefore, it is useful to introduce the creation and\nannihilation operators\nˆa = 1\n√\nμτ a∂\n∂t + t\nτ a\n¶\n,\nˆa+ = 1\n√\nμ\n-τ a∂\n∂t + t\nτ a\n¶\n,\n(5.92)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nNet Gain Window\ng =l\nSaturation\nGain\nStationary Pulse\nGrowing\nPerturbation\nModulator losses\nt\nA\nB\nA\nB\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nwith τ a =\n4p\nDf/Ms. The evolution operator ˆL is then given by\nˆL = g -l -2\np\nDfMs\nμ\nˆa+ˆa + 1\n¶\n(5.93)\nand the evolution equation (5.91) can be written as\nTM\n∂A\n∂T = ˆLA.\n(5.94)\nConsequently, the eigensolutions of this evolution operator are the Hermite-\nGaussians, which we used already before\nAn(T, t)\n=\nun(t)eλnT/TM\n(5.95)\nun(t)\n=\ns\nWn\n2n√πn!τ a\nHn(t/τ a)e\n-t2\n2τ2a\n(5.96)\nand τ a is the pulsewidth of the Gaussian.(see Figure 5.16a)\nFigure 5.16: Lower order eigenmodes of the linearized system for zero detun-\ning, ∆= 0, (a) and for a detuning, ∆= 0.32, in (b).\nThe eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other because the evolution op-\nerator is hermitian in this case.\nThe round-trip gain of the eigenmode un(t) is given by its eigenvalue (or\nin general by the real part of the eigenvalue) which is given by λn = gn -\nl -2\np\nDfMs(n + 0.5) where gn = g0\n1 +\nWn\nPLTR\n-1\n, with Wn =\nR\n|un(t)|2 dt.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nTime, (arb.u.)\nn = 0\nPulse Envelope,\n(arb.u.)\nTime, (arb.u.)\nPulse Envelope,\n(arb.u.)\nn = 2\nn = 4\nn = 8\nn = 18\nLoss\na\nb\n∆ = 0.32\n∆ = 0\n\n5.7. ACTIVE MODELOCKING WITH DETUNING\nThe eigenvalues prove that, for a given pulse energy, the mode with n = 0,\nwhich we call the ground mode, experiences the largest gain. Consequently,\nthe ground mode will saturate the gain to a value such that λ0 = 0 in steady\nstate and all other modes experience net loss, λn < 0 for n > 0, as discussed\nbefore. This is a stable situation as can be shown rigorously by a linearized\nstability analysis [6]. Thus active modelocking with perfect synchronization\nproduces Gaussian pulses with a 1/e--half width of the intensity profile given\nby τ a.\nIn the case of non zero detuning Td, the situation becomes more complex.\nThe evolution operator, (5.93), changes to\nˆLD = g -l -2\np\nDfMs\n∙¡\nˆa+ -∆\n¢\n(ˆa + ∆) + (1\n2 + ∆2)\n\n(5.97)\nwith the normalized detuning\n∆=\np\n2DfMs\nTd\nτ a\n.\n(5.98)\nIntroducing the shifted creation and annihilation operators, ˆb+ = ˆa+ + ∆and\nˆb = ˆa + ∆, respectively, we obtain\nˆLD = ∆g -2\np\nDfMs\nˆb+ˆb -2∆ˆb\n\n(5.99)\nwith the excess gain\n∆g = g -l -2\np\nDfMs(1\n2 + ∆2)\n(5.100)\ndue to the detuning. Note, that the resulting evolution operator is not any\nlonger hermitian and even not normal, i.e.\n£\nA, A+¤\n6= 0, which causes the\neigenmodes to become nonnormal [8]. Nevertheless, it is an easy excercise to\ncompute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the new evolution operator in\nterms of the eigenstates of ˆb+ˆb, |li , which are the Hermite Gaussians centered\naround ∆. The eigenvectors |φni to ˆLD are found by the ansatz\n|φni =\nn\nX\nl=0\ncn\nl |li , with cn\nl+1 =\nn -l\n2∆\n√\nl + 1cn\nl .\n(5.101)\nThe new eigenvalues are λn = gn -l -2\np\nDfMs(∆2 + n + 0.5). By inspec-\ntion, it is again easy to see, that the new eigenstates form a complete basis in\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nL2(IR). However, the eigenvectors are no longer orthogonal to each other. The\neigensolutions as a function of time are given as a product of a Hermite Poly-\nnomial and a shifted Gaussian un(t) = ht |φni ∼Hn(t/τ a) exp\nh\n-(t-\n√\n2∆τa)2\n2τ2a\ni\n.\nAgain, a linearized stability analysis shows that the ground mode, i.e.|φ0i ,\na Gaussian, is a stable stationary solution. Surprisingly, the linearized anal-\nysis predicts stability of the ground mode for all values of the detuning in\nthe parabolic modulation and gain approximation. This result is even inde-\npendent from the dynamics of the gain, i.e. the upper state lifetime of the\nactive medium, as long as there is enough gain to support the pulse. Only\nthe position of the maximum of the ground mode,\n√\n2∆· τ a, depends on the\nnormalized detuning.\nFigure 5.15 summarizes the results obtained so far. In the case of de-\ntuning, the center of the stationary Gaussian pulse is shifted away from the\nposition of minimum loss of the modulator. Since the net gain and loss within\none round-trip in the laser cavity has to be zero for a stationary pulse, there\nis a long net gain window following the pulse in the case of detuning due\nto the necessary excess gain. Figure 2 shows a few of the resulting lowest\norder eigenfunctions for the case of a normalized detuning ∆= 0 in (a) and\n∆= 0.32 in (b). These eigenfunctions are not orthogonal as a result of the\nnonnormal evolution operator\n5.7.1\nDynamics of the Detuned Actively Mode-locked\nLaser\nTo get insight into the dynamics of the system, we look at computer simu-\nlations for a Nd:YLF Laser with the parameters shown in Table 5.3 Figures\nEL = 366 μJ\ng0 = 0.79\nτ L = 450 μs\nMs = 2.467 · 1017s-2\nΩg = 1.12 THz\nDg = 2 · 10-26 s2\nTR = 4 ns\nτ a = 17 ps\nl = 0.025\nλ0 = 1.047 μm\nM = 0.2\nTable 5.3: Data used in the simulations of a Nd:YLF laser.\n5.17 show the temporal evolution of the coefficient cn,when the master equa-\n\n5.7.

However, for large a, the two eigenvectors become\nmore and more parallel, so that a decomposition of a small initial vector\nalmost orthogonal to the basis vectors needs large components (Figure 5.23)\nThe solution is\nu(t) = eAtu0 = c1e-t/2 -→v 1 + c2 e-t -→v 2.\nSince the eigenvalues are negative, both contributions decay, and the\nsystem is stable. However, one eigen component decays twice as fast than\n\n5.7. ACTIVE MODELOCKING WITH DETUNING\nthe other one. Of importance to us is the transient gain that the system is\nshowing due to the fact of near parallel eigen vectors. Both coefficients c1\nand c2 are large. When one of the components decays, the other one is still\nthere and the resulting vector\nu(t →2) ≈c1e-1 -→v 1.\ncan be much larger then the initial perturbation during this transient phase.\nThis is transient gain. It can become arbitrarily large for large a.\n5.7.3\nThe Nonormal Behavior of the Detuned Laser\nThe nonnormality of the operator,\nh\nˆLD, ˆL+\nD\ni\n∼∆, increases with detuning.\nFigure 5.24 shows the normalized scalar products between the eigenmodes\nfor different values of the detuning\nC(m, n) =\n\nhφm |φni\np\nhφm |φmi hφn |φni\n.\n(5.105)\nThe eigenmodes are orthogonal for zero detuning. The orthogonality vanishes\nwith increased detuning.\nThe recursion relation (5.101) tells us that the\noverlap of the new eigenmodes with the ground mode increases for increasing\ndetuning. This corresponds to the parallelization of the eigenmodes of the\nlinearzed problem which leads to large transient gain,\n°°°eˆLDt°°°, in a nonnormal\nsituation [2]. Figure 5.24d shows the transient gain for an initial perturbation\nfrom the stationary ground mode calculated by numerical simulations of the\nlinearized system using an expansion of the linearized system in terms of Fock\nstates to the operator ˆb. A normalized detuning of ∆= 3 already leads to\ntransient gains for perturbations of the order of 106 within 20, 000 round-trips\nwhich lead to an enormous sensitivity of the system against perturbations.\nAn analytical solution of the linearized system neglecting the gain saturation\nshows that the transient gain scales with the detuning according to exp(2∆2).\nThis strong super exponential growth with increasing detuning determines\nthe dynamics completely.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nFigure 5.24: Scalar products of eigenvectors as a function of the eigenvector\nindex for the cases ∆= 0 shown in (a), ∆= 1 in (b) and ∆= 3 in (c). (d)\nshows the transient gain as a funtion of time for these detunings computed\nand for ∆= 2, from the linearized system dynamics.\nFigure 5.25: Critical detuning obtained from numerical simulations as a func-\ntion of the normalized pumping rate and cavity decay time divided by the\nupper-state lifetime.

ACTIVE MODELOCKING WITH DETUNING\nFigure 5.25 shows the surface of the transition to turbulence in the pa-\nrameter space of a Nd:YLF laser, i.e. critical detuning ∆, the pumping rate\nr = g0/l and the ratio between the cavity decay time Tcav = TR/l and the\nupper state lifetime τ L. In this model, we did not inlcude the spontaneous\nemission.\nThe transition to turbulence always occurs at a normalized detuning of\nabout ∆≈3.7 which gives a transient gain exp(2∆2) = 1012. This means that\nalready uncertainties of the numerical integration algorithm are amplified to\na perturbation as large as the stationary state itself.To prove that the system\ndynamics becomes really chaotic, one has to compute the Liapunov coefficient\n[9]. The Liapunov coefficient describes how fast the phase space trajectores\nseparate from each other, if they start in close proximity.\nIt is formally\ndefined in the following way. Two trajectories y(t) and z(t) start in close\nvicinity at t = t0\nky(t0) -z(t0)k = ε = 10-4.\n(5.106)\nThen, the system is run for a certain time ∆t and the logarithmic growth\nrate, i.e. Liapunov coefficient, of the distance between both trajectories is\nevaluated using\nλ0 = ln\nμky(t0 + ∆t) -z(t0 + ∆t)k\nε\n¶\n(5.107)\nFor the next iteration the trajectory z(t) is rescaled along the distance be-\ntween y(t0 + ∆t) and z(t0 + ∆t) according to\nz(t1) = y(t0 + ∆t) + ε y(t0 + ∆t) -z(t0 + ∆t)\nky(t0 + ∆t) -z(t0 + ∆t)k.\n(5.108)\nThe new points of the trajectories z(t1+∆t) and y(t1+∆t) = y(t0+2∆t) are\ncalculated and a new estimate for the Liapunov coefficient λ1 is calculated\nusing Eq.(5.107) with new indices.\nThis procedure is continued and the\nLiapunov coefficient is defined as the average of all the approximations over\na long enough iteration, so that its changes are below a certain error bound\nfrom iteration to iteration.\nλ = 1\nN\nN\nX\nn=0\nλn\n(5.109)\nFigure 5.26 shows the Liapunov coefficient of the Nd:YLF laser discussed\nabove, as a function of the normlized detuning. When the Liapunov coef-\nficient becomes positive, i.e. the system becomes exponentially sensitive to\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nsmall changes in the initial conditions, the system is called chaotic. The\ngraph clearly indicates that the dynamics is chaotic above a critical detuning\nof about ∆c ≈3.7.\nFigure 5.26: Liapunov coefficient over normalized detuning.\nIn the turbulent regime, the system does not reach a steady state, because\nit is nonperiodically interrupted by a new pulse created out of the net gain\nwindow, see Figure 5.15, following the pulse for positive detuning. This pulse\nsaturates the gain and the nearly formed steady state pulse is destroyed and\nfinally replaced by a new one. The gain saturation provides the nonlinear\nfeedback mechanism, which strongly perturbs the system again, once a strong\nperturbation grows up due to the transient linear amplification mechanism.\nThe critical detuning becomes smaller if additional noise sources, such as\nthe spontaneous emission noise of the laser amplifier and technical noise\nsources are taken into account.\nHowever, due to the super exponential\ngrowth, the critical detuning will not depend strongly on the strength of\nthe noise sources. If the spontaneous emission noise is included in the sim-\nulation, we obtain the same shape for the critical detuning as in Fig. 5.25,\nhowever the critical detuning is lowered to about ∆c ≈2. Note that this crit-\nical detuning is very insensitive to any other changes in the parameters of the\nsystem. Therefore, one can expect that actively mode-locked lasers without\nregenerative feedback run unstable at a real detuning, see (5.98) given by\nTd = 4\np\n2DfMsτ a\n(5.110)\nKaertner, F.

      "content": "Chapter 6\nPassive Modelocking\nAs we have seen in chapter 5 the pulse width in an actively modelocked laser\nis inverse proportional to the fourth root of the curvature in the loss modu-\nlation. In active modelocking one is limited to the speed of electronic signal\ngenerators. Therefore, this curvature can never be very strong. However, if\nthe pulse can modulate the absorption on its own, the curvature of the ab-\nsorption modulationcan become large, or in other words the net gain window\ngenerated by the pulse can be as short as the pulse itself. In this case, the\nnet gain window shortens with the pulse. Therefore, passively modelocked\nlasers can generate much shorter pulses than actively modelocked lasers.\nHowever, a suitable saturable absorber is required for passive modelock-\ning. Depending on the ratio between saturable absorber recovery time and fi-\nnal pulse width, one may distinguish between the regimes of operation shown\nin Figure 6.1, which depicts the final steady state pulse formation process.\nIn a solid state laser with intracavity pulse energies much lower than the sat-\nuration energy of the gain medium, gain saturation can be neglected. Then\na fast saturable absorber must be present that opens and closes the net gain\nwindow generated by the pulse immediately before and after the pulse. This\nmodelocking principle is called fast saturable absorber modelocking, see Fig-\nure 6.1 a).\nIn semiconductor and dye lasers usually the intracavity pulse energy ex-\nceeds the saturation energy of the gain medium and so the the gain medium\nundergoes saturation. A short net gain window can still be created, almost\nindependent of the recovery time of the gain, if a similar but unpumped\nmedium is introduced into the cavity acting as an absorber with a somewhat\nlower saturation energy then the gain medium. For example, this can be\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nFigure 6.1: Pulse-shaping and stabilization mechanisms owing to gain and\nloss dynamics in passively mode-locked lasers: (a) using only a fast saturable\nabsorber; (b) using a combination of gain and loss saturation; (c) using a\nsaturable absorber with a finite relaxation time and soliton formation.\narranged for by stronger focusing in the absorber medium than in the gain\nmedium. Then the absorber bleaches first and opens a net gain window,\nthat is closed by the pulse itself by bleaching the gain somewhat later, see\nFigure 6.1 b). This principle of modelocking is called slow-saturable absorber\nmodelocking.\nWhen modelocking of picosecond and femtosecond lasers with semicon-\nductor saturable absorbers has been developed it became obvious that even\nwith rather slow absorbers, showing recovery times of a few picoseconds, one\nwas able to generate sub-picosecond pulses resulting in a significant net gain\nwindow after the pulse, see Figure 6.1 c). From our investigation of active\nmodelocking in the presence of soliton formation, we can expect that such a\nsituation may still be stable up to a certain limit in the presence of strong\nsoliton formation. This is the case and this modelocking regime is called\nsoliton modelocking, since solitary pulse formation due to SPM and GDD\nshapes the pulse to a stable sech-shape despite the open net gain window\nfollowing the pulse.\nKartner, F. X., and U. Keller. \"Stabilization of soliton-like pulses with a slow saturable absorber.\"\nOptics Letters 20 (1990): 16-19.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\n\n6.1. SLOW SATURABLE ABSORBER MODE LOCKING\n6.1\nSlow Saturable Absorber Mode Locking\nDue to the small cross section for stimulated emission in solid state lasers,\ntypical intracavity pulse energies are much smaller than the saturation energy\nof the gain. Therefore, we neglected the effect of gain saturation due to one\npulse sofar, the gain only saturates with the average power. However, there\nare gain media which have large gain cross sections like semiconductors and\ndyes, see Table 4.1, and typical intracavity pulse energies may become large\nenough to saturate the gain considerably in a single pass. In fact, it is this\neffect, which made the mode-locked dye laser so sucessful. The model for the\nslow saturable absorber mode locking has to take into account the change\nof gain in the passage of one pulse [1, 2]. In the following, we consider a\nmodelocked laser, that experiences in one round-trip a saturable gain and a\nslow saturable absorber. In the dye laser, both media are dyes with different\nsaturation intensities or with different focusing into the dye jets so that gain\nand loss may show different saturation energies. The relaxation equation of\nthe gain, in the limit of a pulse short compared with its relaxation time, can\nbe approximated by\ndg\ndt = -g|A(t)|2\nEL\n(6.1)\nThe coefficient EL is the saturation energy of the gain. Integration of the\nequation shows, that the gain saturates with the pulse energy E(t)\nE(t) =\nZ t\n-TR/2\ndt|A(t)|2\n(6.2)\nwhen passing the gain\ng(t) = gi exp [-E(t)/EL]\n(6.3)\nwhere gi is the initial small signal gain just before the arrival of the pulse. A\nsimilar equation holds for the loss of the saturable absorber whose response\n(loss) is represented by q(t)\nq(t) = q0 exp [-E(t)/EA]\n(6.4)\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nwhere EA is the saturation energy of the saturable absorber. If the back-\nground loss is denoted by l, the master equation of mode-locking becomes\nTR\n∂\n∂T A\n=\n[gi (exp (-E(t)/EL)) A -lA-\nq0 exp (-E(t)/EA)] A +\nΩ2\nf\n∂2\n∂t2A\n(6.5)\nHere, we have replaced the filtering action of the gain Dg =\nΩ2\nf as\nproduced by a separate fixed filter.\nAn analytic solution to this integro-\ndifferential equation can be obtained with one approximation: the exponen-\ntials are expanded to second order. This is legitimate if the population deple-\ntions of the gain and saturable absorber media are not excessive. Consider\none of these expansions:\nq0 exp (-E(t)/EA)\n≈\nq0\n∙\n1 -(E(t)/EA) + 1\n2 (E(t)/EA)2\n\n.\n(6.6)\nWe only consider the saturable gain and loss and the finite gain bandwidth.\nThan the master equation is given by\nTR\n∂A(T, t)\n∂T\n=\n∙\ng(t) -q(t) -l + Df\n∂2\n∂t2\n\nA(T, t).\n(6.7)\nThe filter dispersion, Df = 1/Ω2\nf, effectively models the finite bandwidth\nof the laser, that might not be only due to the finite gain bandwidth, but\nincludes all bandwidth limiting effects in a parabolic approximation. Sup-\npose the pulse is a symmetric function of time. Then the first power of the\nintegral gives an antisymmetric function of time, its square is symmetric.\nAn antisymmetric function acting on the pulse A(t) causes a displacement.\nHence, the steady state solution does not yield zero for the change per pass,\nthe derivative\nTR\n∂A\n∂T must be equated to a time shift ∆t of the pulse. When\nthis is done one can confirm easily that A(t) = Ao sech(t/τ) is a solution of\n(6.6) with constraints on its coefficients. Thus we, are looking for a \"steady\nstate\" solution A(t, T) = Ao sech( t\nτ + α T\nTR).Note, that α is the fraction of\nthe pulsewidth, the pulse is shifted in each round-trip due to the shaping by\nloss and gain. The constraints on its coefficients can be easily found using\n\n6.1.

Consider first the equation for\nthe inverse pulsewidth, (6.14). In order to get a real solution, the right hand\nside has to be positive. This implies that q0/E2\nA > gi/E2\nL. The saturable\nabsorber must saturate more easily, and, therefore more strongly, than the\ngain medium in order to open a net window of gain (Figure 6.2).\nThis was accomplished in a dye laser system by stronger focusing into\nthe saturable absorber-dye jet (Reducing the saturation energy for the sat-\nurable absorber) than into the gain-dye jet (which was inverted, i.e. optically\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nFigure 6.2: Dynamics of a laser mode-locked with a slow saturable absorber.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nTime\nGain\nLoss\nGain\nSaturable\nAbsorber\nNet gain\nDynamics of a laser mode-locked with a slow saturable absorber.\nTR\nTR\n\n6.1. SLOW SATURABLE ABSORBER MODE LOCKING\npumped). Equation (6.12) makes a statement about the net gain before pas-\nsage of the pulse. The net gain before passage of the pulse is\ngi -q0 -l\n=\n-\nΩ2\nfτ 2 + gi\n\"\nW\n2EL\n-\nμ W\n2EL\n¶2#\n-q0\n\"\nW\n2EA\n-\nμ W\n2EA\n¶2#\n.\n(6.15)\nUsing condition (6.14) this can be expressed as\ngi -q0 -l\n=\ngi\n∙W\n2EL\n\n-q0\n∙W\n2EA\n\n+\nΩ2\nfτ 2 .\n(6.16)\nThis gain is negative since the effect of the saturable absorber is larger than\nthat of the gain. Since the pulse has the same exponential tail after passage\nas before, one concludes that the net gain after passage of the pulse is the\nsame as before passage and thus also negative. The pulse is stable against\nnoise build-up both in its front and its back. This principle works if the\nratio between the saturation energies for the saturable absorber and gain\nχP = EA/EP is very small. Then the shortest pulsewidth achievable with a\ngiven system is\nτ =\n√q0Ωf\nEA\nW >\n√q0Ωf\n.\n(6.17)\nThe greater sign comes from the fact that our theory is based on the ex-\npansion of the exponentials, which is only true for\nW\n2EA < 1. If the filter\ndispersion 1/Ω2\nf that determines the bandwidth of the system is again re-\nplaced by an average gain dispersion g/Ω2\ng and assuming g = q0. Note that\nthe modelocking principle of the dye laser is a very faszinating one due to\nthe fact that actually non of the elements in the system is fast. It is the in-\nterplay between two media that opens a short window in time on the scale of\nfemtoseconds. The media themselves just have to be fast enough to recover\ncompletely between one round trip, i.e. on a nanosecond timescale.\nOver the last fifteen years, the dye laser has been largely replaced by\nsolid state lasers, which offer even more bandwidth than dyes and are on top\nof that much easier to handle because they do not show degradation over\ntime. With it came the need for a different mode locking principle, since the\nsaturation energy of these broadband solid-state laser media are much higher\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nthan the typical intracavity pulse energies. The absorber has to open and\nclose the net gain window.\n6.2\nFast Saturable Absorber Mode Locking\nThe dynamics of a laser modelocked with a fast saturable absorber is again\ncovered by the master equation (5.21) [3]. Now, the losses q react instantly\non the intensity or power P(t) = |A(t)|2 of the field\nq(A) =\nq0\n1 + |A|2\nPA\n,\n(6.18)\nwhere PA is the saturation power of the absorber.\nThere is no analytic\nsolution of the master equation (5.21) with the absorber response (6.18).\nTherefore, we make expansions on the absorber response to get analytic\ninsight. If the absorber is not saturated, we can expand the response (6.18)\nfor small intensities\nq(A) = q0 -γ|A|2,\n(6.19)\nwith the saturable absorber modulation coefficient γ = q0/PA. The constant\nnonsaturated loss q0 can be absorbed in the losses l0 = l + q0. The resulting\nmaster equation is, see also Fig. 6.3\nTR\n∂A(T, t)\n∂T\n=\n∙\ng -l0 + Df\n∂2\n∂t2 + γ|A|2 + jD2\n∂2\n∂t2-jδ|A|2\n\nA(T, t).\n(6.20)\n\n6.2.

FAST SATURABLE ABSORBER MODE LOCKING\nNote that in contrast to active modelocking, now the achievable pulse width\nis scaling with the inverse gain bandwidth, which gives much shorter pulses.\nFigure 6.4 can be interpreted as follows: In steady state, the saturated gain is\nbelow loss, by about one half of the exploited saturable loss before and after\nthe pulse. This means, that there is net loss outside the pulse, which keeps\nthe pulse stable against growth of instabilities at the leading and trailing\nedge of the pulse. If there is stable mode-locked operation, there must be\nalways net loss far away from the pulse, otherwise, a continuous wave signal\nrunning at the peak of the gain would experience more gain than the pulse\nand would break through.\nFrom Eq.(6.35) follows, that one third of the\nexploited saturable loss is used up during saturation of the aborber and\nactually only one sixth is used to overcome the filter losses due to the finite\ngain bandwidth. Note, there is a limit to the mimium pulse width, which\ncomes about, because the saturated gain (6.27) is gs = l+ 1\n2q0 and, therefore,\nfrom Eq.(6.40), if we assume that the finite bandwidth of the laser is set by\nthe gain, i.e. Df = Dg =\ng\nΩ2g we obtain for q0 A l\nτ min = 1\nΩg\n(6.41)\nfor the linearly saturating absorber model.

(d) Phase shift per pass. [4]\nFigure 6.6 (a-d) indicate that there are essentially three operating regimes.\nFirst, without GDD and SPM, the pulses are always stable. Second, if there\nis strong soliton-like pulse shaping, i.e. δn A 1 and -Dn A 1 the chirp is\nalways much smaller than for positive dispersion and the pulses are soliton-\nlike.

SOLITON MODE LOCKING\nNote, for this discussion we always assumed a positive SPM-coefficient. In\nthis regime we also obtain the shortest pulses directly from the system, which\ncan be a factor 2-3 shorter than by pure saturable absorber modelocking.\nNote that Figure 6.6 indicates even arbitrarily shorter pulses if the nonlinear\nindex, i.e.\nδn is further increased.\nHowever, this is only an artificat of\nthe linear approximation of the saturable absorber, which can now become\narbitrarily large, compare (6.18) and (6.19).\nAs we have found from the\nanalysis of the fast saturable absorber model, Figure 6.4, only one sixth of\nthe saturable absorption is used for overcoming the gain filtering. This is so,\nbecause the saturable absorber has to shape and stabilize the pulse against\nbreakthrough of cw-radiation. With SPM and GDD this is relaxed. The\npulse shaping can be done by SPM and GDD alone, i.e. soliton formation\nand the absorber only has to stabilize the pulse. But then all of the saturable\nabsorption can be used up for stability, i.e. six times as much, which allows\nfor additional pulse shorteing by a factor of about\n√\n6 = 2.5 in a parbolic\nfilter situation. Note, that for an experimentalist a factor of three is a large\nnumber. This tells us that the 6.5 fs limit for Ti:sapphire derived above from\nthe saturable absorber model can be reduced to 2.6 fs including GDD and\nSPM, which is about one optical cycle of 2.7 fs at a center wavelength of\n800nm. At that point all approximations, we have mode so far break down.\nIf the amount of negative dispersion is reduced too much, i.e. the pulses\nbecome to short, the absorber cannot keep them stable anymore.\nIf there is strong positive dispersion, the pulses again become stable and\nlong, but highly chirped. The pulse can then be compressed externally, how-\never not completely to their transform limit, because these are nonlinearly\nchirped pulses, see Eq.(6.43).\nIn the case of strong solitonlike pulse shaping, the absorber doesn't have\nto be really fast, because the pulse is shaped by GDD and SPM and the\nabsorber has only to stabilize the soliton against the continuum. This regime\nhas been called Soliton mode locking.\n6.3\nSoliton Mode Locking\nIf strong soliton formation is present in the system, the saturable absorber\ndoesn't have to be fast [6][7][8], see Figure 6.7.

PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nThe continuum can be viewed as a long pulse competing with the soliton\nfor the available gain. In the frequency domain, see Figure 6.9, the soliton\nhas a broad spectrum compared to the continuum. Therefore, the continuum\nexperiences the peak of the gain, whereas the soliton spectrum on average\nexperiences less gain. This advantage in gain of the continuum has to be\ncompensated for in the time domain by the saturable absorber response, see\nFigure 6.8. Whereas for the soliton, there is a balance of the nonlinearity\nand the dispersion, this is not so for the continuum. Therefore, the contin-\nuum is spread by the dispersion into the regions of high absorption. This\nmechanism has to clean up the gain window following the soliton and caused\nby the slow recovery of the absorber. As in the case of active modelocking,\nonce the soliton is too short, i.e. a too long net-gain window arises, the loss\nof the continuum may be lower than the loss of the soliton, see Figure 6.7\nand the continuum may break through and destroy the single pulse soliton\nsolution. As a rule of thumb the absorber recovery time can be about 10\ntimes longer than the soliton width. This modelocking principle is especially\nimportant for modelocking of lasers with semiconductor saturable absorbers,\nwhich show typical absorber recovery times that may range from 100fs-100\nps. Pulses as short as 13fs have been generated with semiconductor saturable\nabsorbers [11]. Figure 6.10 shows the measured spectra from a Ti:sapphire\nlaser modelocked with a saturable absorber for different values for the intra-\ncavity dispersion. Lowering the dispersion, increases the bandwidth of the\nsoliton and therefore its loss, while lowering at the same time the loss for the\ncontinuum. At some value of the dispersion the laser has to become unstabile\nby break through of the continuum. In the example shown, this occurs at\na dispersion value of about D = -500fs2. The continuum break-through is\nclearly visible by the additional spectral components showing up at the cen-\nter of the spectrum. Reducing the dispersion even further might lead again\nto more stable but complicated spectra related to the formation of higher\norder solitons. Note the spectra shown are time averaged spectra.\n\n6.3.

The details of the spectra and\nautocorrelation may strongly depend on the detailed absorber response.\n6.4\nDispersion Managed Soliton Formation\nThe nonlinear Schrodinger equation describes pulse propagation in a medium\nwith continuously distributed dispersion and self-phase-modulation.\nFor\nlasers generating pulses as short as 10 fs and below, it was first pointed out by\nSpielmann et al. that large changes in the pulse occur within one roundtrip\nand that the ordering of the pulse-shaping elements within the cavity has a\nmajor effect on the pulse formation [9]. The discrete action of linear disper-\nsion in the arms of the laser resonator and the discrete, but simultaneous,\naction of positive SPM and positive GDD in the laser crystal cannot any\nlonger be neglected. The importance of strong dispersion variations for the\nlaser dynamics was first discovered in a fiber laser and called stretched pulse\nmodelocking [11]. The positive dispersion in the Er-doped fiber section of a\nfiber ring laser was balanced by a negative dispersive passive fiber. The pulse\ncirculating in the ring was stretched and compressed by as much as a factor\nof 20 in one roundtrip. One consequence of this behavior was a dramatic\ndecrease of the nonlinearity and thus increased stability against the SPM\ninduced instabilities. The sidebands, due to periodic perturbations of the\nsoliton, as discussed in section 3.6, are no longer observed (see Fig. 6.12).\nFigure 6.12: Spectra of mode-locked Er-doped fiber lasers operating in the\nconventional soliton regime, i.e. net negative dispersion and in the stretched\npulse mode of operation at almost zero average dispersion [11].\nTamura, K., E.

DISPERSION MANAGED SOLITON FORMATION\nThe energy of the output pulses could be increased 100 fold. The mini-\nmum pulsewidth was 63 fs, with a bandwdith much broader than the erbium\ngain bandwidth [12]. Figure 6.12 also shows the spectral enhancement of the\nfiber laser in the dispersion managed regime. The generation of ultrashort\npulses from solid state lasers like Ti:sapphire has progressed over the past\ndecade and led to the generation of pulses as short as 5 fs directly from the\nlaser. At such short pulse lengths the pulse is streched up to a factor of ten\nwhen propagating through the laser crystal creating a dispersion managed\nsoliton [10]. The spectra generated with these lasers are not of simple shape\nfor many reasons. Here, we want to consider the impact on the spectral\nshape and laser dynamcis due to dispersion managed soliton formation.\nFigure 6.13: (a) Schematic of a Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser:\nP's, prisms; L, lens; DCM's, double-chirped mirror; TiSa, Ti:sapphire.

PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nmedium (Ti:sapphire crystal) and dispersion balancing components (mirrors,\nprism pairs), see Fig. 6.13 a. The system can be decomposed into the res-\nonator arms and the crystal, see Fig. 6.13 b. To achieve ultrashort pulses,\nthe dispersion-balancing components should produce near-zero net dispersion\nwhile the dispersion element(s) individually produce significant group delay\nover the broad bandwidth of the laser pulse. This fact suggests an analogy\nwith dispersion-managed pulse propagation along a dispersion-managed fiber\ntransmission link [14]. A system with sufficient variation of dispersion can\nsupport solitary waves. One can show that the Kerr nonlinearity produces\na self-consistent nonlinear scattering potential that permits formation of a\nperodic solution with a simple phase factor in a system with zero net dis-\npersion. The pulses are analogous to solitons in that they are self-consistent\nsolutions of the Hamiltonian (lossless) problem as the conventional solitons\ndiscussed above. But they are not secant hyperbolic in shape. Figure 6.14\nshows a numerical simulation of a self-consistent solution of the Hamiltonian\npulse-propagation problem in a linear medium of negative dispersion and\nsubsequent propagation in a nonlinear medium of positive dispersion and\npositive self-phase modulation, following the equation\n∂\n∂zA(z, t) = jD(z) ∂2\n∂t2A(z, t) -jδ(z)|A|2A(z, t)\n(6.65)\nIn Fig. 6.15 the steady state intensity profiles are shown at the center of\nthe negative dispersion segment over 1000 roundtrips. It is clear that the solu-\ntion repeats itself from period to period, i.e. there is a new solitary wave that\nsolves the piecewise nonlinear Schroedinger equation 6.65, dispersion man-\naged soliton. In contrast to the conventional soliton the dispersion mangaged\nsoliton of equation 6.65 (with no SAM and no filtering) resemble Gaussian\npulses down to about -10 dB from the peak, but then show rather compli-\ncated structure, see Fig. 6.15.The dispersion map D(z) used is shown as an\ninset in Figure 6.14. One can additionally include saturable gain, Lorentzian\ngain filtering, and a fast saturable absorber. Figure 6.14 shows the behavior\nin one period (one round trip through the resonator) including these effects.\nThe response of the absorber is q(A) = qo/(1+|A|2/PA), with qo = 0.01/mm\nand PA = 1 MW. The bandwidth-limited gain is modeled by the Lorentzian\nprofile with gain bandwidth 2π×43 THz. The filtering and saturable absorp-\ntion reduce the spectral and temporal side lobes of the Hamiltonian problem.\nAs can be inferred from Fig. 6.14, the steady state pulse formation can be\nunderstood in the following way. By symmetry the pulses are chirp free in\n\n6.4. DISPERSION MANAGED SOLITON FORMATION\nFigure 6.14: Pulse shaping in one round trip. The negative segment has no\nnonlinearity.\nthe middle of the dispersion cells. A chirp free pulse starting in the center of\nthe gain crystal, i.e. nonlinear segment is spectrally broadened by the SPM\nand disperses in time due to the GVD, which generates a rather linear chirp\nover the pulse. After the pulse is leaving the crystal it experiences negative\nGVD during propagation through the left or right resonator arm, which is\ncompressing the positively chirped pulse to its transform limit at the end of\nthe arm, where an output coupler can be placed. Back propagation towards\nthe crystal imposes a negative chirp, generating the time reversed solution of\nthe nonliner Schrodinger equation (6.65). Therefore, subsequent propagation\nin the nonlinear crystal is compressing the pulse spectrally and temporally\nto its initial shape in the center of the crystal. The spectrum is narrower in\nthe crystal than in the negative-dispersion sections, because it is negatively\nprechirped before it enters the SPM section and spectral spreading occurs\nagain only after the pulse has been compressed. This result further explains\nthat in a laser with a linear cavity, for which the negative dispersion is lo-\ncated in only one arm of the laser resonator (i.e. in the prism pair and no\nuse of chirped mirrors) the spectrum is widest in the arm that contains the\nnegative dispersion . In a laser with a linear cavity, for which the negative\ndispersion is equally distributed in both arms of the cavity, the pulse runs\nChen, Y., et al. \"Dispersion managed mode-locking.\" Journal of Optical Society of Americas B 16 (1999): 1999-2004.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nthrough the dispersion map twice per roundtrip. The pulse is short at each\nend of the cavity and, most importantly, the pulses are identical in each pass\nthrough the crystal, which exploits the saturable absorber action (Kerr-Lens\nModelocking in this case, as will be discussed in the next chapter) twice\nper roundtrip, in contrast to an asymmetric dispersion distribution in the\nresonator arms. Thus a symmetric dispersion distribution leads to an effec-\ntive saturable absorption that is twice as strong as an asymmetric dispersion\ndistribution resulting in substantially shorter pulses. Furthermore, the dis-\npersion swing between the negative and positive dispersion sections is only\nhalf, which allows for shorter dispersion-managed solitons operating at the\nsame average power level.\nFigure 6.15: Simulation of the Hamiltonian problem.

DISPERSION MANAGED SOLITON FORMATION\nTo further illustrate the efficiency of the dispersion managed soliton for-\nmation, we present a series of simulations that start with a linear segment\nof negative dispersion and a nonlinear segment of positive dispersion of the\nsame magnitude, saturable absorber action, and filtering.\nFigure 6.16: Sequence of pulse profiles in the center of the negatively dis-\npersive segment for three magnitudes of SPM. to = 3 fs, with solid curves\n(5.5 fs) for δ = 1 (MW mm)-1, dashed-dotted curve (7 fs) for δ = 0.5 (MW\nmm)-1, and dashed cuves for no SPM of δ = 0. The dispersion map is of\nFig. 6.14. The output coupler loss is 3%.[10]\nThe dashed curve in Figure 6.16 shows the pulse shape for gain, loss,\nsaturable absorption and gain filtering only. We obtained the other traces\nby increasing the SPM while keeping the energy fixed through adjustment\nof the gain.\nAs one can see, increasing the SPM permits shorter pulses.\nThe shortest pulse can be approximately three times shorter than the pulse\nwithout SPM. The parameters chosen for the simulations are listed in the\nfigure caption. In this respect, the behavior is similar to the fast saturable\nabsorber case with conventional soliton formation as discussed in the last\nsection.\nA major difference in the dispersion managed soliton case is illustrated in\nFig. 6.17. The figure shows the parameter ranges for a dispersion-managed\nsoliton system (no gain, no loss, no filtering) that is unbalanced such as to\nresult in the net dispersion that serves as the abscissa of the figure. Each\ncurve gives the locus of energy versus net cavity dispersion for a stretching\nChen, Y., et al. \"Dispersion managed mode-locking.\" Journal of Optical Society of Americas B 16 (1999): 1999-2004.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\nratio S = LD/τ 2\nFWHM (or pulse width with fixed crystal length L). One can\nsee that for pulse width longer than 8 fs with crystal length L = 2 mm,\nno solution of finite energy exists in the dispersion managed system for zero\nor positive net dispersion. Pulses of durations longer than 8 fs require net\nnegative dispersion. Hence one can reach the ultrashort dispersion managed\nsoliton operation at zero net dispersion only by first providing the system\nwith negative dispersion. At the same energy, one can form a shorter pulse\nby reducing the net dispersion, provided that the 8 fs threshold has been\npassed. For a fixed dispersion swing ±D, the stretching increases quadrat-\nically with the spectral width or the inverse pulse width. Long pulses with\nno stretching have a sech shape. For stretching ratios of 3-10 the pulses are\nGaussian shaped. For even larger stretching ratios the pulse spectra become\nincreasingly more flat topped, as shown in Fig. 6.16.\nFigure 6.17: Energy of the pulse in the lossless dispersion-managed system\nwith stretching S = LD/τ 2\nFWHM or for a fixed crystal length L and pulsewidth\nas parameters; D = 60 fs2/mm for Ti:sapphire at 800 nm [10].\nTo gain insight into the laser dynamics and later on in their noise and\ntuning behavior, it is advantageous to formulate also a master equation ap-\nproach for the dispersion managed soliton case [16]. Care has to be taken of\nthe fact that the Kerr-phase shift is produced by a pulse of varying amplitude\nand width as it circulates around the ring. The Kerr-phase shift for a pulse\nChen, Y., et al. \"Dispersion managed mode-locking.\" Journal of Optical Society of Americas B 16 (1999): 1999-2004.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\n\n6.4. DISPERSION MANAGED SOLITON FORMATION\nof constant width, δ|a|2 had to be replaced by a phase profile that mimics\nthe average shape of the pulse, weighted by its intensity. Therefore, the SPM\naction is replaced by\nδ|A|2 = δo|Ao|2\nμ\n1 -μ t2\nτ 2\n¶\n(6.66)\nwhere Ao is the pulse amplitude at the position of minimum width. The\nKerr-phase profile is expanded to second order in t. The coefficient δo and\nμ are evaluated variationally.\nThe saturable absorber action is similarly\nexpanded. Finally, the net intracavity dispersion acting on average on the\npulse is replaced by the effective dispersion Dnet in the resonator within one\nroundtrip. The master equation becomes\nTR\n∂\n∂T A\n=\n(g -l)A +\nA\nΩ2\nf\n+ jDnet\n!\n∂2\n∂t2A\n+(γo -jδo)|Ao|2\nμ\n1 -μ t2\nτ 2\n¶\nA\n(6.67)\nThis equation has Gaussian-pulse solutions. The master equation (6.67)\nis a patchwork, it is not an ordinary differential equation. The coefficients in\nthe equation depend on the pulse solution and eventually have to be found\niteratively. Nevertheless, the equation accounts for the pulse shaping in the\nsystem in an analytic fashion. It will allow us to extend the conventional\nsoliton perturbation theory to the case of dispersion managed solitons.\nThere is one more interesting property of the stretched pulse operation\nthat needs to be emphasized. Dispersion managed solitons may form even\nwhen the net dispersion as seen by a linearly propagating pulse is zero or\nslightly positive.\nThis is a surprising result which was discovered in the\nstudy of dispersion managed soliton propagation [14]. It turns out that the\nstretched pulse changes its spectrum during propagation through the two\nsegments of fiber with opposite dispersion or in the case of a Ti:Sapphire\nlaser in the nonlinear crystal. The spectrum in the segment with normal\n(positive) dispersion is narrower, than in the segment of anomalous (nega-\ntive) dispersion, see Figure 6.14. The pulse sees an effective net negative\ndispersion, provided that the positive Dnet is not too large. In (6.67) the\nDnet is to be replaced by Deffwhich can be computed variationally. Thus,\n\nCHAPTER 6. PASSIVE MODELOCKING\ndispersion managed soliton-like solutions can exist even when Dnet is zero.\nHowever, they exist only if the stretching factor is large, see Figure 6.17.\nA remarkable property of the dispersion managed solitons is that they do\nnot radiate (generate continuum) even though they propagate in a medium\nwith abrupt dispersion changes. This can be understood by the fact, that the\ndispersion mangaged soliton is a solution of the underlaying dynamics incor-\nporating already the periodic dispersion variations including the Kerr-effect.\nThis is in contrast to the soliton in a continuously distributed dispersive en-\nvironment, where periodic variations in dispersion and nonlinearity leads to\nradiation.\n\nBibliography\n[1] G.H.C.

One can use\nreal saturable absorbers, such as semiconductors or dyes and solid-state laser\nmedia. One can also exploit artificial saturable absorbers. The two most\nprominent artificial saturable absorber modelocking techniques are called\nKerr-Lens Mode Locking (KLM) and Additive Pulse Mode Locking (APM).\nAPM is sometimes also called Coupled-Cavity Mode Locking (CCM). KLM\nwas invented in the early 90's [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], but was already predicted\nto occur much earlier [8][9][10]·\n7.1\nKerr-Lens Mode Locking (KLM)\nThe general principle behind Kerr-Lens Mode Locking is sketched in Fig. 7.1.\nA pulse that builds up in a laser cavity containing a gain medium and a Kerr\nmedium experiences not only self-phase modulation but also self focussing,\nthat is nonlinear lensing of the laser beam, due to the nonlinear refractive in-\ndex of the Kerr medium. A spatio-temporal laser pulse propagating through\nthe Kerr medium has a time dependent mode size as higher intensities ac-\nquire stronger focussing. If a hard aperture is placed at the right position\nin the cavity, it strips of the wings of the pulse, leading to a shortening of\nthe pulse. Such combined mechanism has the same effect as a saturable ab-\nsorber. If the electronic Kerr effect with response time of a few femtoseconds\nor less is used, a fast saturable absorber has been created. Instead of a sep-\n\n258CHAPTER 7.

The hard aperture can be also\nreplaced by the soft aperture due to the spatial variation of the gain in the\nlaser crystal.\narate Kerr medium and a hard aperture, the gain medium can act both as a\nKerr medium and as a soft aperture (i.e. increased gain instead of saturable\nabsorption). The sensitivity of the laser mode size on additional nonlinear\nlensing is drastically enhanced if the cavity is operated close to the stability\nboundary of the cavity. Therefore, it is of prime importance to understand\nthe stability ranges of laser resonators. Laser resonators are best understood\nin terms of paraxial optics [11][12][14][13][15].\n7.1.1\nReview of Paraxial Optics and Laser Resonator\nDesign\nThe solutions to the paraxial wave equation, which keep their form during\npropagation, are the Hermite-Gaussian beams. Since we consider only the\nfundamental transverse modes, we are dealing with the Gaussian beam\nU(r, z) = Uo\nq(z) exp\n∙\n-jk\nr2\n2q(z)\n\n,\n(7.1)\n\n7.1. KERR-LENS MODE LOCKING (KLM)\nwith the complex q-parameter q = a + jb or its inverse\nq(z) =\nR(z) -j\nλ\nπw2(z).\n(7.2)\nThe Gaussian beam intensity I(z, r) = |U(r, z)|2 expressed in terms of the\npower P carried by the beam is given by\nI(r, z) =\n2P\nπw2(z) exp\n∙\n-2r2\nw2(z)\n\n.\n(7.3)\nThe use of the q-parameter simplifies the description of Gaussian beam prop-\nagation. In free space propagation from z1 to z2, the variation of the beam\nparameter q is simply governed by\nq2 = q1 + z2 -z1,\n(7.4)\nwhere q2 and q1 are the beam parameters at z1 and z2. If the beam waist,\nat which the beam has a minimum spot size w0 and a planar wavefront\n(R = inf), is located at z = 0, the variations of the beam spot size and the\nradius of curvature are explicitly expressed as\nw(z) = wo\n\"\n1 +\nμ λz\nπw2o\n¶2#1/2\n,\n(7.5)\nand\nR(z) = z\n\"\n1 +\nμπw2\no\nλz\n¶2#\n.\n(7.6)\nThe angular divergence of the beam is inversely proportional to the beam\nwaist. In the far field, the half angle divergence is given by,\nθ =\nλ\nπwo\n,\n(7.7)\nas illustrated in Figure 7.2.\n\n260CHAPTER 7. KERR-LENS AND ADDITIVE PULSE MODE LOCKING\nFigure 7.2: Gaussian beam and its characteristics.\nDue to diffraction, the smaller the spot size at the beam waist, the larger\nthe divergence. The Rayleigh range is defined as the distance from the waist\nover which the beam area doubles and can be expressed as\nzR = πw2\no\nλ .\n(7.8)\nThe confocal parameter of the Gaussian beam is defined as twice the Rayleigh\nrange\nb = 2zR = 2πw2\no\nλ\n,\n(7.9)\nand corresponds to the length over which the beam is focused. The propa-\ngation of Hermite-Gaussian beams through paraxial optical systems can be\nefficiently evaluated using the ABCD-law [11]\nq2 = Aq1 + B\nCq1 + D\n(7.10)\nwhere q1 and q2 are the beam parameters at the input and the output planes\nof the optical system or component. The ABCD matrices of some optical\nelements are summarized in Table 7.1.

The resonator is stable if no ray escapes after many round-trips, which\nis the case when the eigenvalues of the matrix M are less than one. Since\nwe have a lossless resonator, i.e. det|M| = 1, the product of the eigenvalues\nhas to be 1 and, therefore, the stable resonator corresponds to the case of a\ncomplex conjugate pair of eigenvalues with a magnitude of 1.

The\nresult is shown in Fig. 7.13. The transformation from L to L00 transforms\nthe stability ranges according to Fig. 7.14. The confocal parameter of the\nlaser mode is approximately equal to the stability range.\nAstigmatism Compensation\nSo far, we have considered the curved mirrors under normal incidence. In a\nreal cavity this is not the case and one has to analyze the cavity performance\nfor the tangential and sagittal beam separately. The gain medium, usually a\nthin plate with a refractive index n and a thickness t, generates astigmatism.\nAstigmatism means that the beam foci for sagittal and tangential plane are\nnot at the same position. Also, the stablity regions of the cavity are different\nfor the different planes and the output beam is elliptical. This is so, because\na beam entering a plate under an angle refracts differently in both planes, as\ndescribed by different ABCD matricies for tangential and sagittal plane, see\nTable 7.1.Fortunately, one can balance the astigmatism of the beam due to\n\n7.1.

When the laser is\nmode-locked, the peak power P rises by many orders of magnitude, roughly\nthe ratio of cavity round-trip time to the final pulse width, assuming a con-\nstant pulse energy. For a 100 MHz, 10 fs laser, this is a factor of 106. With\nthe help of the matrix formulation of the Kerr effect, one can iteratively find\nthe steady state beam waists in the laser.

KERR-LENS MODE LOCKING (KLM)\nvalues for the beam waists by calculating a new cavity round-trip propaga-\ntion matrix based on a given peak power P. This scheme can be iterated\nuntil there is only a negligible change from iteration to iteration.

KERR-LENS AND ADDITIVE PULSE MODE LOCKING\nThe Kerr lensing effect can be exploited in different ways to achieve mode\nlocking.\nSoft-Aperture KLM\nIn the case of soft-aperture KLM, the cavity is tuned in such a way that\nthe Kerr lensing effect leads to a shrinkage of the laser mode when mode-\nlocked. The non-saturated gain in a laser depends on the overlap of the pump\nmode and the laser mode. From the rate equations for the radial photon\ndistribution N(r) and the inversion NP(r) of a laser, which are proportional\nto the intensities of the pump beam and the laser beam, we obtain a gain,\nthat is proportional to the product of N(r) and NP(r).If we assume that the\nfocus of the laser mode and the pump mode are at the same position and\nneglect the variation of both beams as a function of distance, we obtain\ng\n∼\nZ inf\nN(r) ∗NP(r)rdr\n∼\nZ inf\n2P P\nπw2\nP\nexp\n∙\n-2r2\nw2\nP\n\nπw2\nL\nexp\n∙\n-2r2\nw2\nL\n\nrdr\nWith the beam cross sections of the pump and the laser beam in the gain\nmedium, AP = πw2\nP and AL = πw2\nL ,we obtain\ng ∼\nAP + AL\n.\nIf the pump beam is much stronger focused in the gain medium than the laser\nbeam, a shrinkage of the laser mode cross section in the gain medium leads\nto an increased gain. When the laser operates in steady state, the change\nin saturated gain would have to be used for the investigation. However, the\ngeneral argument carries through even for this case. Figure 7.16 shows the\nvariation of the laser mode size in and close to the crystal in a soft-aperture\nKLM laser due to self-focusing.\n\n7.1. KERR-LENS MODE LOCKING (KLM)\nFigure 7.16: Variation of laser mode size in and close to the crystal in a soft\naperture KLM laser due to self-focussing.\nHard-Aperture KLM\nIn a hard-aperture KLM-Laser, one of the resonator arms contains (usually\nclose to the end mirrors) an aperture such that it cuts the beam slightly.\nWhen Kerr lensing occurs and leads to a shrinkage of the beam at this posi-\ntion, the losses of the beam are reduced. Note, that depending on whether\nthe aperture is positioned in the long or short arm of the resontor, the operat-\ning point of the cavity at which Kerr lensing favours or opposes mode-locking\nmay be quite different (see Figure 7.13).\n0.00\nCavity Coordinate (mm)\nGaussian beam radius (μm)\nTangential Plane\nSagittal Plane\nP=1.5MW\nP=1.5MW\nP=0\nP=0\nPump Beam\nPump Beam\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\nxtal\nxtal\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n280CHAPTER 7.

In the fiber\nstrong SPM occurs and introduces a significant phase shift between the peak\nand the wings of the pulse. In the case shown the phase shift is π\nA part of the modified and heavily distorted pulse is reinjected into the\ncavity in an interferometrically stable way, such that the injected pulse inter-\nferes constructively with the next cavity pulse in the center and destructively\nin the wings. This superposition leads to a shorter intracavity pulse and the\npulse shaping generated by this process is identical to the one obtained from\na fast saturable absorber. Again, an artificial saturable absorber action is\ngenerated.\n\n7.2.

A prominent candidate\nfor a saturable absorber is semiconductor material, which was pioneered by\nIslam, Knox and Keller [1][2][3] The great advantage of using semiconductor\nmaterials is that the wavelength range over which these absorbers operate\ncan be chosen by material composition and bandstructure engineering, if\nsemiconductor heterostructures are used (see Figure 8.1). Even though, the\nbasic physics of carrier dynamics in these structures is to a large extent well\nunderstood [4], the actual development of semiconductor saturable absorbers\nfor mode locking is still very much ongoing.\n\nCHAPTER 8.

A curved mirror determines the\nspot-size of the laser beam on the saturable absorber and, therefore, scales\nthe energy fluence on the absorber at a given intracavity energy.\n8.1\nCarrier Dynamics and Saturation Prop-\nerties\nThere is a rich ultrafast carrier dynamics in these materials, which can be\nfavorably exploited for saturable absorber design. The carrier dynamics in\nbulk semiconductors occurs on three major time scales (see Figure 8.4 [5]).\nWhen electron-hole pairs are generated, this excitation can be considered\n\nCHAPTER 8. SEMICONDUCTOR SATURABLE ABSORBERS\nas an equivalent two-level system if the interaction between the carriers is\nneglected, which is a very rough assumption.\nFigure 8.4: Carrier dynamics in a bulk semiconducotr material. Three time\nscales can be distinguished. I. Coherent carrier dynamics, which at room tem-\nperature may last between 10-50 fs depending on excitation density. II. Ther-\nmalization between the carriers due to carrier-carrier scattering and cooling\nto the lattice temperature by LO-Phonon emission. III. Carrier-trapping or\nrecombination [5].\nThere is a coherent regime (I) with a duration of 10-50 fs depending on\nconditions and material. Then in phase (II), carrier-carrier scattering sets\nin and leads to destruction of coherence and thermalization of the electron\nand hole gas at a high temperature due to the excitation of the carriers high\nin the conduction or valence band. This usually happens on a 60 - 100 fs\ntime scale. On a 300fs - 1ps time scale, the hot carrier gas interacts with\nthe lattice mainly by emitting LO-phonons (37 meV in GaAs). The carrier\ngas cools down to lattice temperature. After the thermalization and cooling\nprocesses, the carriers are at the bottom of the conduction and valence band,\nEg\nE\ne - LO\ne - e\nlh\nhh\n| k |\nI\nII\nIII\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n8.1. CARRIER DYNAMICS AND SATURATION PROPERTIES\nrespectively. The carriers vanish (III) either by getting trapped in impurity\nstates, which can happen on a 100 fs - 100 ps time scale, or recombine over\nrecombination centers or by radiation on a nanosecond time-scale. Carrier-\nlifetimes in III-VI semiconductors can reach several tens of nanoseconds and\nin indirect semiconductors like silicon or germanium lifetimes can be in the\nmillisecond range. The carrier lifetime can be engineered over a large range\nof values from 100 fs - 30ns, depending on the growth conditions and purity\nof the material. Special low-temperature growth that leads to the formation\nor trapping and recombination centers as well as ion-bombardment can result\nin very short lifetimes [9]. Figure 8.5 shows a typical pump probe response\nof a semiconductor saturable absorber when excited with a 100 fs long pulse.\nThe typical bi-temporal behavior stems from the fast thermalization (spectral\nhole-burning)[7] and carrier cooling and the slow trapping and recombination\nprocesses.\nFigure 8.5: Pump probe response of a semiconductor saturable absorber\nmirror with a multiple-quantum well InGaAs saturable absorber grown at\nlow temperature [3].\nWith the formula for the saturation intensity of a two-level system Eq.\n(2.145), we can estimate a typical value for the saturation fluence Fs (satu-\nration energy density) of a semiconductor absorber for interband transitions.\nThe saturation fluence FA, also related to the absorption cross-section σA, is\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nReflectivity\nTime delay (ps)\nCarrier recombination\nIntraband thermalization\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nCHAPTER 8.

HIGH FLUENCE EFFECTS\nA typical value for the fluence at wich damage is observed on an absorber\nis on the order of a few mJ/cm2. Saturating an absorber by a factor of 10\nwithout damaging it is still possible .\nThe damage threshold is strongly\ndependent on the growth, design, fabrication and mounting (heat sinking) of\nthe absorber.\nFigure 8.7: GaAs saturable absorber grown an GaAs wafer and transfered\nonto a metal mirror by post growth processing [10].\n8.2\nHigh Fluence Effects\nTo avoid Q-switched mode-locking caused by a semiconductor saturable ab-\nsorber, the absorber very often is operated far above the saturation fluence\nor enters this regime during Q-switched operation. Therefore it is also im-\nportant to understand the nonlinear optical processes occuring at high exci-\ntation levels [13].

At higher fluences, two-photon absorption (TPA) and\nfree carrier absorption (FCA) in the InP half-wave layer develop and enven-\ntually dominate [13].\nFigure 8.8: Differential reflectivity measurements of a semiconductor sat-\nurable absorber mirror (GaAs/AlAs-Bragg-mirror and InP half-wave layer\nwith embedded InGaAsP quantum well absorber for the 1.55 μm range.

At higher fluences, TPA\nand FCA develop and enventually dominate [13].\nThe assumption that TPA and FCA are responsible for this behaviour has\nbeen verified experimentally.

The\nquantum well was placed close to a null of the field. A strong TPA peak is\nfollowed by induced FCA with a single ∼5ps decay for FCA. Both of these\ndynamics do not significantly depend on the wavelength of the excitation,\nas long as the excitation remains below the band gap.

As\nexpected, TPA and FCA vary linearly and quadratically, respectively, with\npump power.The pump-induced absorption of the probe (TPA) is linearly\ndependent on the pump power. Since FCA is produced by carriers that are\ngenerated by the pump alone via TPA, FCA scales with the square of the\npump power.\nFigure 8.9: Differential reflectivity measurements under high fluence excita-\ntion at 1.56 μm for a saturable absorber mirror structure in which absorption\nbleaching is negligible (solid cuve).

(Inset) Linear and quadratic fluence\ndependence of the TPA and FCA components, respectively.\nThese high fluence effects lead to strong modifications of the saturation\ncharacteristics of a saturable absorber. The importance of the high fluence\neffects was first recognized in resonant absorbers (see Figure 8.10). The field\ninside the absorber is enhanced by adding a top reflector and a proper spacer\nlayer. This leads to an effective lower saturation fluence when viewed with\nLanglois, P. et al. \"High fluence ultrafast dynamics of semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors.\"\nApplied Physics Letters 75 (1999): 3841-3483.

Therefore, high fluenece effects\nare already reached at low intracavity intensities (see Figure 8.9).\nFigure 8.10: A top reflector is added to the semiconductor saturable absorber\nsuch that the field in the quantum well is resonantely enhanced by about a\nfactor of 10 in comparison to the non resonant case.\nTheon, E.

BREAK-UP INTO MULTIPLE PULSES\nFigure 8.11: Saturation fluence measurement (dots) of the resonant absorber\nshown in Figure 8.10 with 150 fs pulses at 1.53 μm. Fits are shown using\na fast or slow saturable absorber and TPA. Also the scaled saturation char-\nacteristics of the absorber are shown when used in a laser with longer pulse\ndurations.\nThe roll-over of the saturation characteristics has positive and negative\nconsequences for mode locking. First, if the roll-over can be reached with the\navailable intracavity pulse energy, Q-switching can be suppressed. Second if\nthe roll-over occurs too early, the pulses break up into multiple pulses to\noptimize the net gain for the overall pulse stream.\n8.3\nBreak-up into Multiple Pulses\nIn the treatment of mode locking with fast and slow saturable absorbers we\nonly concentrated on stability against energy fluctuations (Q-switched mode\nlocking) and against break through of cw-radiation or continuum. Another\noften observed instability is the break-up into multiple pulses. The existience\nof such a mechanism is obvious if soliton pulse shaping processes are present.\nIf we assume that the pulse is completely shaped by the solitonlike pulse\nshaping processes, the FWHM pulse width is given by\nτ FWHM = 1.764 |D2|\nδW .\n(8.4)\nTheon, E. R., et al. \"Two-photon absorption in semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors.\"\nApplied Physics Letters 74 (1999): 3927-3929. Used with permission.\n\nCHAPTER 8. SEMICONDUCTOR SATURABLE ABSORBERS\nwhere W denotes the pulse energy. D2 the negative disperison and δ the self-\nphase modulation coefficient. With increasing pulse energy, of course the\nabsorber becomes more strongly saturated, which leads to shorter pulses ac-\ncording to the saturable absorber and the soliton formula. At a certain point,\nthe absorber will saturate and can not provide any further pulse stabiliza-\ntion. However, the Kerr nonlinearity may not yet saturate and, therefore,\nthe soliton formula dictates an ever decreasing pulse width for increasing\npulse energy. Such a process continues, until either the continuum breaks\nthrough, because the soliton loss becomes larger than the continuum loss, or\nthe pulse breaks up into two pulses. The pulses will have reduced energy\nper pulse and each one will be longer and experiences a reduced loss due\nto the finite gain bandwidth. Due to the reduced pulse energy, each of the\npulses will suffer increased losses in the absorber, since it is not any longer\nas strongly saturated as before. However, once the absorber is already over\nsaturated by the single pulse solution, it will also be strongly saturated for\nthe double-pulse solution. The filter loss due to the finite gain bandwidth\nis heavily reduced for the double-pulse solution. As a result, the pulse will\nbreak up into double-pulses. To find the transition point where the break-up\ninto multiple pulses occurs, we write down the round-trip loss due to the gain\nand filter losses and the saturable absorber according to 6.35\nlm = Df\n3τ 2m\n+ qs(Wm),\n(8.5)\nwhere, qs(Wm) is the saturation loss experienced by the pulse when it prop-\nagates through the saturable absorber. This saturation loss is given by\nqs(W) = 1\nW\n+inf\nZ\n-inf\nq(T, t)|As(t)|2dt.\n(8.6)\nThis expression can be easily evaluated for the case of a sech-shaped steady\nstate pulse in the fast saturable absorber model with\nqfast(t) =\nq0\n1 + |A(t)|2\nPA\n,\nwhere\nPA = EA\nτ A\n.\n(8.7)\nand the slow saturable absorber model, where the relaxation term can be\nneglected because of τ A A τ.\nqslow(t) = q0 exp\n∙\n-1\nEA\nZ t\n-inf\n|As(t0)|2dt0\n\n.\n(8.8)\n\n8.3. BREAK-UP INTO MULTIPLE PULSES\nFor the slow absorber 8.8 the absorber losses (8.6) can be evaluated indepen-\ndent of pulse shape to be\nqs.slow(W) = q0\n1 -exp\nh\n-W\nEA\ni\nW\nEA\n.\n(8.9)\nThus for a slow absorber the losses depend only on pulse energy. In contrast,\nfor a fast absorber, the pulse shape must be taken into account and, for a\nsech-shaped pulse, one obtaines [14]\nqs,fast(W) = q0\ns\nα (1 + α)tanh-1\n∙r\nα\n1 + α\n\n, with α =\nW\n2PAτ ,\n(8.10)\nand the pulse energy of one pulse of the multiple pulse solution. The energy\nis determined from the total gain loss balance\ng0\n1 + mWm\nPLTR\n= l + lm.\n(8.11)\nMost often, the saturable absorber losses are much smaller than the losses\ndue to the output coupler. In that case the total losses are fixed independent\nof the absorber saturation and the filter losses. Then the average power does\nnot depend on the number of pulses in the cavity. If this is the case, one\npulse of the double pulse solution has about half of the energy of the single\npulse solution, and, therefore, the width of the double pulse is twice as large\nas that of the single pulse according to (8.4). Then the filter and absorber\nlosses for the single and double pulse solution are given by\nl1 = Df\n3τ 2\n+ qs(W1),\n(8.12)\nl2 = Df\n12τ 2\n+ qs(W1\n2 ).\n(8.13)\nThe single pulse solution is stable against break-up into double pulses as long\nas\nl1 ≤l2\n(8.14)\nis fulfilled. This is the case, if the difference in the filter losses between the\nsingle and double pulse solution is smaller than the difference in the saturable\nabsorber losses\nDf\n4τ 2\n< ∆qs(W) = qs(W\n2 ) -qs(W).\n(8.15)\n\nCHAPTER 8. SEMICONDUCTOR SATURABLE ABSORBERS\nFigure 8.12 shows the difference in the saturable absorption for a single\npulse and a double pulse solution as a function of the ratio between the\nsingle pulse peak power and saturation power for a fast absorber and as a\nfunction of the ratio between the single pulse energy and saturation energy\nfor a slow absorber. Thus, for both cases the optimum saturation ratio, at\nwhich the largest discrimination between single and double pulses occurs and,\ntherefore, the shortest pulse before break-up into multiple pulses occurs, is\nabout 3. Note, that to arrive at this absolute number, we assumed that the\namount of saturable absoption is neglegible in comparison with the other\nintracavity losses, so that the saturated gain level and the gain and filter\ndispersion are fixed.\nFigure 8.12: Difference in loss experienced by a sech-shaped pulse in a slow\n(- - -) and a fast (____) saturable absorber for a given pulse energy or peak\npower , respectively.\nAt this optimum operation point, the discrimination against multiple\nbreak-up of a fast absorber is about 50% larger than the value of the slow ab-\nsorber. Since the minimum pulsewidth scales with the square root of ∆qs(W),\nsee Eq. (8.15), the minimum pulsewidth of the slow absorber is only about\n22% longer than with an equally strong fast saturable absorber. Figure 8.12\nalso predicts that a laser modelocked by a fast saturable absorber is much\nmore stable against multiple pulse break-up than a slow saturable absorber if\nit is oversaturated . This is due to the fact that a fast saturable absorber sat-\nurates with the peak power of the pulse in comparison with a slow saturable\nabsorber, which saturates with the pulse energy. When the pulse breaks up\ninto a pulse twice as long with half energy in each, the peak power of the\nKartner, F. X., J. A. d. Au, and U.

BREAK-UP INTO MULTIPLE PULSES\nindividual pulses changes by a factor of four. Therefore, the discrimination\nbetween long and short pulses is larger in the case of a fast saturable ab-\nsorber, especially for strong saturation. Note that Fig. 8.12 is based on the\nsimple saturation formulas for fast and slow saturable absorbers Eqs. (8.9)\nand (8.10). We compare these predictions with numerical simulations and\nexperimental observations made wiht a Nd:glass laser [15][16].\nThe Nd:glass laser described in ref. [15] was modelocked by a saturable\nabsorber which showed a fast recovery time of τ A = 200 fs, a modulation\ndepth of q0 = 0.005 and a saturation energy of EA = 17 nJ. The other laser\nparameters can be found in [16]. Without the solitonlike pulse formation\n(GDD and SPM is switched off), the laser is predicted to produce about\n200 fs short pulses with a single pulse per round-trip, very similar to what\nwas discussed in the fast saturable absorber mode locking in Chapter 6. The\ndynamics becomes very much different if the negative GDD and positive SPM\nare included in the simulation, (see Figure 8.13)\nFigure 8.13: Each trace shows the pulse intensity profile obtained after 20,000\ncavity round-trips in a diode-pumped Nd:glass laser according to [15]. When\nthe laser reaches the double-pulse regime the multipel pulses are in constant\nmotion with respect to each other. The resulting pulse train is not any longer\nstationary in any sense.\nKartner, F. X., J. A. d. Au, and U.

SEMICONDUCTOR SATURABLE ABSORBERS\nWith increasing small signal gain, i. e. increasing pulse energy, the soliton\nshortens to 80 fs due to the solitonlike pulse shaping, (Figure 8.13).\nFigure 8.14: Steady state pulse width ( R°) and time-bandwidth product (o)\nfor a Nd:glass laser modelocked by a saturable absorber with a 200 fs recovery\ntime with GDD and SPM included, shown as a function of the intracavity\npulse energy. The time-bandwidth product is only meaningful in the single\npulse regime, where it is shown. The pulses are almost transform limited\nsech-pulses. The pulse width in the multiple pulseing regime is only unique\nin the parameter region where multiple pulses of similar height and width\nare achieved. The pulses break up into multiple pulses when the absorber is\nabout three times saturated.\nThe pulse width follows nicely the soliton relation (8.4), (dash-dotted\nline). The pulses become shorter, by about a factor of 2.5, than without\nGDD and SPM before the pulse breaks up into longer double-pulses. The\npulse break-up into double-pulses occurs when the absorber is about two\ntimes saturated, close to the point where the shortest pulse can be expected\naccording to the discussion above. Figures 8.13 shows, that the break-up\npoint for the double pulses is also very close to the instability for continuum\nbreak-through. Indeed the first pulse train after break-up at a small signal\ngain of g0 = 0.09 shows the coexistance of a longer and a shorter pulse,\nwhich indicates continuum break-through. But the following five traces are\ndouble pulses of equal height and energy. For even stronger saturation of the\nKartner, F. X., J. A. d. Au, and U.

BREAK-UP INTO MULTIPLE PULSES\nabsorber the double-pulses break-up into triple pulses and so on. Then the\ndynamics becomes even more complex. This behavior has been observed in\ndetail in a Nd:glass laser [15], (see Figure 8.15), as well as in Cr4+:YAG lasers\n[17]. The simulations just discussed match the parameters of the Nd:glass\nexperiments.\nFigure 8.15: Pulsewidth in a Nd:glass laser [15] as a function of intracavity\nstored energy, i.e. pulse energy for a single pulse per round-trip. Dots mea-\nsured values and solid line fits for a single and double-pulse solitonlike pulse\nstream.\nFigure 8.15 clearly shows the scaling of the observed pulse width according\nto the soliton formula until the pulses break up at a saturation ratio of about\n2. Notice, that the absorber recovery time of 200 fs is not much shorter than\nthe pulse width achieved. Nevertheless, the optimum saturation ratio is close\nto the expected one of about 3. The break-up into pure double and triple\npulses can be observed more clearly if the absorber recovery time is chosen to\nbe shorter, so that continuum break-through is avoided. Figure 8.16 shows\nthe final simulation results obtained after 20,000 round-trips in the cavity, if\nwe reduce the absorber recovery time from 200 fs to 100 fs, again for different\nsmall signal gain, e.g. intracavity power levels and pulse energies. Now, we\nobserve a clean break-up of the single-pulse solution into double-pulses and\nat even higher intracavity power levels the break-up into triple pulses without\ncontinuum generation in between.
