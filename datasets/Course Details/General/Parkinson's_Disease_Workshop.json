It is named after James Parkinson (1755-1824), the English neurologist who described the first case.\n\nWhile the underlying pathogenic mechanisms at play in PD remain unclear, it is recognized that people with a family history of PD, as well as those who have been exposed to certain pesticides, metals, and chemicals, carry an increased risk of developing the disease.\n\nThe development and application of positron emission tomography (PET) and structural and functional high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to the study of PD has led to a more thorough understanding of the neural abnormalities underlying the disease. At the same time, the resolution of current neuroimaging methods has rendered them largely ineffective in the diagnosis of the disease.\n\nThis six-week summer workshop explored different aspects of PD, including clinical characteristics, structural neuroimaging, neuropathology, genetics, and cognitive function (mental status, cognitive control processes, working memory, and long-term declarative memory). The workshop did not take up the topics of motor control, nondeclarative memory, or treatment.\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nCognition in Parkinson's Disease\n\nNeuropathology and Structural Neuroimaging in Parkinson's Disease\n\nGenetics of Parkinson's Disease\n\nCognitive Control Processes and Working Memory in Parkinson's Disease\n\nA Systems Neuroscience Approach to Memory\n\nLong-term Declarative Memory in Parkinson Disease",

common pathway?\n-\nIncomplete penetrance of some genetic components, and relatively high rates of \"risk factor\"\nmutations in sporadic PD points to a multifactoral explaination for neurodegeneration in PD\n-\nToday there are at least 10 distinct genetic loci associated with PD\n\nUseful Terms - thanks Sue!\n-\npolymorphism - a naturally occurring variation in the sequence of genetic information on a\nsegment of DNA among individuals; a genetic characteristic with more than one common form\nin a population\n-\nmutation - a variant allele that occurs in less than 1% of the population\n-\nallele - each person inherits two alleles for each gene, one allele from each parent; these\nalleles may be the same or may be different from one another\n- homozygous mutation: both alleles contain the same mutation\n- heterozygous mutation: one allele contains the mutation\n- compound heterozygous mutation: each allele has a different mutation\n-\nprotein domain - a region of conserved, specific functionality within a protein\n-\ngain-of-function - when a mutation increases the rate of or propensity for protein function\n-\nloss-of-function - when a mutation decreases the normal functioning of a protein\n\nGenetic Primer\n-\n\"Central dogma\" of molecular biology: DNA\n-> RNA -> protein\n-\nEukaryotic genes contain both coding\nregions (exons) and non-coding regions\n(introns);

associated with toxic gain-of-function; these mutations\nare not present in sporadic PD or individuals without disease\n-\nDuplications and triplications have been implicated in PDD and DLB; individuals with SNCA\nmultiplications present symptoms similar to sporadic PD, but are prone to dementia and\nautonomic dysfunction\n-\nDosage of gene is directly related to age of onset of PD (38-65 years for duplications, 24-48\nyears for triplications)\n-\nα-synuclein binds preferentially to plasma membrane;

OR\n- Does the hippocampus play a specialized role\nin the recollection of inter-item associations\n(relational memory), while memory for individual\nitems (and intra-item features) is mediated by\nadjacent cortical regions (perirhinal,\nparahippocampal cortices)\n\nIs there a dissociation of function\nwithin the MTL?\n- Logic: If all MTL structures contribute equally to\nall forms of declarative learning, then amnesic\npatients with MTL lesions should show similar\nmagnitudes of impairment across a range of\ndeclarative memory tasks\n- Evidence: Under certain encoding and retrieval\nconditions, amnesic patients show surprisingly\ngood recognition memory coupled with poor\nrecall ability\n\nH.M. showed normal forced-\nchoice recognition up to 1 week\nafter

control\nsubjects\nH.M.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nIn contrast, H.M.'s ability to recall\nitems (or item locations) is at chance\n\nWhat brain areas support this\nunexpected learning?\nCorkin, 2002 Corkin, 2002\n\nDual-process Theory\nRecognition\nRecollection\nFamiliarity\n\"I Remember\"\n\"I Know\"\nItem-Item\nItem\nItem-Context\nperirhinal cortex\nhippocampus\nparahippocampal cortex\n\nRecall vs. recognition\n\nDirect comparisons between recall\nand recognition are hard to make\n- Why?\n- Because the two memory measures often are not matched\nin difficulty (recognition is easier than recall)\n- They always differ in their scales of measurement\n- How do researchers circumvent these problems?\n- Equate amnesic patients and CON on recognition\nmemory performance, and then assess whether,\nunder condition of equated recognition, recall\nperformance is also matched\n- The results from several such studies were\ninconsistent, but Giovanelli & Verfaillie (2001) shed\nlight on at least part of the reason for the\ninconsistencies\n\nExperiment 1\n- Compared recall and recognition performance of AMN and\nCON\n- Matched AMN recognition to CON recognition by giving AMN\nadditional study exposures (6 vs 1)\n- Study-test interval 1 min\n- Reasoned that recognition and familiarity would contribute to\nrecognition performance of CON, but AMN's recognition\nperformance would be mediated primarily by familiarity\n- Thus, even though the use of multiple learning trials may\nequate the recognition performance of AMN and CON, it does\nnot equate the processes that mediate such performance.\n- The fact that recollection makes a greater contribution to the\nperformance of CON than to the performance of AMN leads to\nthe prediction that despite equated recognition memory, AMN's\nrecall performance will be worse than that of CON\nGiovanello & Verfaellie, 2001\n\nMean recall and recognition scores\nof AMN and CON in Experiment 1\n3⁄4The dissociation between AMN's recall and recognition\nperformance is inconsistent with the view that AMN have a\nuniform disruption in all processes that support explicit memory\n(Squire, 1992)\n3⁄4Instead, it lends support to the notion that AMN show a relative\npreservation of familiarity, a process that can support recognition\nbut not recall\nGiovanello & Verfaellie, 2001\n\nExperiment 2\n- Compared recall and recognition performance of AMN and\nCON\n- Matched AMN recognition to CON recognition by testing AMN\nafter a 1-min delay and CON after a 24-hr delay\n- AMN completed all testing in 1 session\n- CON tested on 3 consecutive days\n- Day 1: studied a word list\n- Day 2: performed recall task and studied a different word list\n- Day 3: performed recognition task\n- As the study-test delay increases, recollection declines more\nrapidly than familiarity (Gardiner & Java, 1991)\n- Thus, when CON are tested after a delay, their recollection is\nlikely to be impoverished, just as is the case in AMN\n- Because the performance of both groups would be mediated\nprimarily by familiarity, Giovanello & Verfaellie (2001) predicted\nthat once recognition was equated, recall performance would\nbe equated as well\n\nMean recall and recognition scores\nof AMN and CON in Experiment 2\n3⁄4Recognition accuracy was successfully matched between the 2\ngroups\n3⁄4AMN recall was not significantly different from CON\n3⁄4Testing CON after a delay renders them functionally amnesic\n3⁄4Because of the decline in recollection associated with testing\nafter a delay, the performance of CON, like that of AMN, is\nprimarily mediated by familiarity, thus masking the AMN's deficit in\nrecollection\nGiovanello & Verfaellie, 2001\n\nConclusions\n- The relation between AMN's recall and recognition\nperformance depends on the method by which AMN's\nrecognition is matched to CON's recognition\n- This finding does not imply that one method of\nequating is better than another\n- Which method is selected depends on the goals of a\nparticular study\n- The contribution of familiarity and recollection differed\nacross experiments\n- In Exp 1, recollection made a larger contribution to the\nperformance of CON than to that of AMN; recall in the CON\nexceeded that in the AMN group\n- In Exp 2, the performance of both groups was supported\nlargely by familiarity; recall performance was equivalent\nacross both groups\nGiovanello & Verfaellie, 2001\n\nWhat about PDs?\n- If PDs are impaired on familiarity but not\nrecollection, then the following predictions\nshould be upheld:\n- Procedure 1: study-test interval 1 min\n- Recall (recollection): PD=CON\n- Recognition (recollection makes a larger\ncontribution than familiarity): PD=CON\n- Procedure 2: study-test interval 24 hr\n- Recall (recollection): PD=CON\n- Recognition (supported largely by familiarity):\nPD<CON\n\nRemember-know paradigm\nGardiner & Java, 1991\n\nResponse probability as a\nfunction of retention interval\nOver retention

suggests\nthat the familiarity-based contribution to\nrecognition memory performance is\npreserved in AMN, whereas the recollective-\nbased component is drastically impaired\n(e.g., Aggleton et al., 2005)\n\nWhat's wrong with the remember-\nknow procedure?\n- Recollection is categorical, but familiarity is continuous\n- The method relies on participants' subjective reports\n- How do we know that YA and OA interpret \"remember\" and\n\"know\" responses the same way? Or OAs and PDs?\n- Is the sense of remembering qualitatively similar for the two\ngroups being compared?\n- When a participant endorses an item as \"remembered,\" it is not\nclear what types of info the participant has retrieved\n- A \"remember\"response can signify retrieval of info ranging from\na variety of contextual elements (e.g., remembering a feeling\nelicited by the stimulus, or remembering the item that preceded\nthe stimulus) to memory for the exact features of the stimulus\n(e.g., remembering the font in which the word was written)\n- It is likely that memory for these different types of information is\nsupported by different processes\n\nTo circumvent these issues, researchers have\nadopted paradigms that require recognition\nconfidence judgments\n(e.g., Ranganath et al.)\nand paradigms that more directly compare\nmemory for associations or relations with\nmemory for isolated items\n(e.g., Hockley & Consoli; Giovanello, Verfaellie &\nKeane; and Davachi & Wagner)\n\nLesion studies\n- Neuroimaging studies cannot speak to the necessity\nof particular brain regions for specific memory\nfunctions\n- To fill this void, several studies have investigated the\ndegree to which lesion locus or extent affects the\nlikelihood that AMNs are impaired specifically on the\nrecollective or associative components of a memory\ntask\n- If the hippocampal formation is disproportionately\nengaged during recollective or associative processing,\ncompared to familiarity-based processing, then AMN\npatients with damage limited to the hippocampus\nshould show a relative sparing of item recognition\nrelative to associative recognition\n(e.g., Vargha-Khadem et al., 1997; Mayes et al., 2004)"
