The course is designed primarily for Masters of Science in Real Estate Development (MSRED) students interested in doing their summer semester thesis in the area of real estate finance and investments. The class is limited to a small size, with preference given to MSRED students. The course will follow an informal \"seminar\" format to the maximum degree possible, with students expected to take considerable initiative. Students are encouraged to explore in depth a topic of their interest. The only graded requirement is a term paper on that topic. Lectures and discussions led by the instructors will be supplemented by several guest speakers from the real estate investment industry, who will present perspectives on current trends and important developments in the industry.\n\nAdministration\n\nThe class will usually meet twice weekly, and we will generally also make use of the ?recitation? slot. The exact scheduling will have to be flexible to accommodate external speakers. We may use the recitation slot for those speakers, and/or for student presentations of their term papers or work in progress.\n\nGrading\n\nThe grade will be based primarily on the term paper, due on the last day of classes. We will attempt to enable as many students as possible to make a brief oral presentation of their term paper to the class. This presentation may be of the finished product or of work in progress, or conceivably even of the topic idea. Grading consideration will also be given to the degree and constructive quality of class participation, particularly in helping the outside speakers to effectively convey their knowledge and experience to the class.",

If α is defined relative to the short party's current \"bearish\"\nexpectations about the market, then the \"bear\" term drops out of the price condition (but\nthe \"bear\" term is in that case included in α, so the numerical result is the same as here).\n- For more depth and detail, see: D.Geltner & N.Miller et al, \"Commercial Real Estate\nAnalysis & Investments\" , Thomson/South-Western College Publishing Co.\nCincinnati (2007) (ISBN# 0-324-30548-6)."

As human being, we\nhave the capacity to manage uncertainties\nproactively. This capacity is called flexibility\nand contingency planning.\nNext we'll finally explore ways to introduce\nflexibility in our model.\n\nQuestions for \"Big vs. small\"\nThe past two sessions have covered ways to model\nuncertainty. It seems like the big plant is better...\nDoes it feel right?\nNote: we had assumed a commitment to building one\nsmall plant each year regardless of what demand\nreality turns out to be down the road. So much for\nflexibility and common sense. Lets correct that\noversight!\n\nSession three - Flexibility\n- Objectives\n- Build flexibility into the model\n- See how that impacts our decision-making\n- Perform simple breakeven analysis\n\nKey limitation of NPV analysis\n- It assumes that future decisions are made today, for\nexample for constructing small plants\nDecide whether\nto build a plant\nDecide whether\nto build a plant\nDecide whether\nto build a plant\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\n- But the decisions are actually made each year\nDecide whether\nto build a plant\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\n\n- There is a LOT of value in delaying decisions until:\n- More information becomes available\n- Forecast uncertainty decreases with time and collection of\nadditional data\n- Ability to delay decisions in future is a source of\nflexibility\n- Flexibility is the magic bullet against uncertainty!\nKey limitation of NPV analysis\n\nModeling contingency decisions\n- Recall the spreadsheet we built for Session two\n- Press \"F9\" and check which plan is better?\n- Think about the following decision rule:\n- After the first plant is built in year 1, we build an\nadditional small plant only if we observe a bigger\ndemand than capacity\n- How do we model that?\n- Open \"Excel 07 Session3 1.xls\"\n\n-\nIn \"Plan B RAND with Flexibility\" sheet:\n-\nin Cell G3 type: \"=IF(E5>E4,E3+1,E3)\"\n-\nIn Cell I3 type: \"=IF(G5>G4,G3+1,G3)\"\n-\nPress \"F9\"\n-\nNow which plan is better?\n-\nHow easily can the traditional analysis be\nmisleading, despite properly simulating the\nuncertainties!\n-\nHow different is this kind of analysis from\nsensitivity analysis?\nModeling contingency decisions\n\nCheck the solution sheet.\nPlease ask questions now...\n\nQuestion for \"Big vs. small\"\nSince Plan B with flexibility is better than Plan A, the\nmanager is tempted to go with small plant. Just then\nthe Chief Operations Officer reports the variable cost\nfor the big plant can be further cut (the variable cost\nfor a small plant remains the same).\nWhat is the breakeven variable cost point for Plan A\nwhere the two plans are equivalent?\n\nBreakeven analysis\n- A breakeven level for a parameter - a\ntarget value where some particularly\ninteresting event occurs\n- In a deterministic case, a breakeven\npoint can be determined by \"Goal Seek\"\n- In a simulation, we can not use Data\nTables (sim on sim). However, we still\ncan do trial-and-error search\n\nUse the Spinner\n1.\nOn \"Entries\" sheet, type \"=Simulation!D4-Simulation!D1\" in Cell\nH3\n2.\nHit F9 and find \"mean NPVB - mean NPVA\".\n3.\nUse spinner to lower Variable cost for big plant\n4.\nSomewhere around Variable cost for big plant = 1.25, mean\nNPVA - mean NPVB approaches 0\n5.\nNote: what we are really trying to do is run a \"simulation on\nsimulation\" to find the Plan-A's variable cost where average\nNPVs for the two plans are equal.\n-\nExcel does not support recursive simulations ;-(\n-\nSpinner gives an approximate answer, but requires manual input.\n\nCheck the solution sheet.\nPlease ask questions now...\n\nSummary\n- Incorporated flexibility into the models\n- Breakeven analysis\n- Excel is a powerful modeling tool.

      "content": "Advanced Topics in Real Estate Finance\nIntroduction to CMBS Credit Default Swaps\n\nBo Chirathivat\nMay 21, 2007\n\nCommercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) are the latest asset class to join the\nfamily of credit derivatives indices. Credit derivatives are bilateral financial contracts that\ntransfer credit exposure from one counter party to another, without a transfer of the\nunderlying asset. Credit derivatives isolate credit as a distinct asset class, and allow\nfinancial institutions and corporations to manage credit risk more efficiently.\n\nThe simplest and most widely used form of credit derivatives is the credit default swap\n(CDS), which is conceptually similar to credit insurance, an insurance policy associated\nwith a specific loan against default for which the purchaser of the insurance pays a\nregular premium. One of the differences between credit insurance and a credit default\nswap is that a credit default swap provides insurance against losses suffered due to some\npredefined credit events. Credit events definition is outlined in the legal documentation\nbetween counterparties, and does not necessarily involve default. Another difference is\nthat credit derivatives are tradable, while credit insurance contracts are generally not.\nCredit default swap contracts are very liquid in the corporate world, but have not yet\nemerged in the CMBS market as liquid synthetic tools.\n\nThere are two primary hindrances to the development of CMBS credit derivatives. First,\nthe lack of contract standardization causes investors' hesitation in trading the derivatives.\nThe efficiency and liquidity of aligning buyers and sellers highly depend on consistent,\nreliable legal documentations. The ISDA has been at the forefront of this development.\n\nSecond, while the ability to buy or sell protection on a specific bond may help investors\nhedge a position or gain exposure to an asset that is unavailable in the cash market, it is\nnot a particularly efficient way to gain or shed exposure to a diverse pool of assets. With\nthe introduction of tradable CMBS index in March 2006, investors can now gain a\ndiversified CMBS exposure. The index should also increase transparency in the market.\n\nWhile there are other forms of credit derivatives such as total return swaps and credit\nlinked notes, the focus of this paper is on credit default swaps in the context of the CMBS\nmarket. In this chapter, I am introducing the credit default swaps for CMBS, explaining\ntheir benefits and applications, and finally discussing the role of index in the derivatives\nmarket.\n\nCredit Default Swap in the context of CMBS market\nSynthetic CMBS deal structures involve the removal of the credit risk associated with a\npool of commercial mortgages by means of a credit default swap. A Credit default swap\nenables the protection buyer to isolate and reduce its credit exposure to a reference entity\nand the protection seller to synthetically gain exposure to the same entity. The protection\nbuyer pays a periodic fixed fee called a default swap premium to a protection seller over\nthe life of the transaction, in return for which the seller will make a payment on the\noccurrence of a specified credit event. The premium is usually quoted as a basis point\nmultiplier of the benchmarked notional value of the reference entity. In a CMBS, the\nreference asset is essentially a basket of CMBS securities. A cash flow exchange\nmechanism of a default swap is illustrated below:\n\nCMBS\ncontracts\nare\ndesigned\ndifferently\nfrom the traditional credit default swap contracts in the corporate world. They have been\ntailored to accommodate certain nuances specific to CMBS.\n\nMechanics\nIn most CMBS contracts, there are three credit events:\n1. Principal write-down\nA principal write-down refers to a reduction in the outstanding balance of the\nreference CMBS pool. In a principal write-down, the protection seller would\ncompensate the protection buyer in the amount of the write-down. The contract ends\nif the reference asset is fully written down. A partial write-down amount\nproportionately reduces the notional value of the reference asset that the default swap\n\npremium is based on. In this case, the protection buyer would continue paying the\npremium on the proportionately reduced notional amount, and the protection seller\npays nothing.\n2. Interest shortfall\nAn interest shortfall occurs when the interest passed through from the underlying\nmortgage loan is less than the interest to be paid on the security. CMBS subordinate\nclasses often suffer from interest shortfalls. There are three methods that determine\nthe mechanic of the compensation in the event of an interest shortfall.\n- Fixed-cap\nIn a Fixed-cap method, the protection buyer is compensated for interest shortfall\nup to the default swap premium. The protection buyer is not compensated for the\ninterest shortfall amount that exceeds this premium. In the case that the shortfall is\nequal to or higher than the swap premium, the premium paid by protective buyer\noffsets the interest shortfall amount, resulting in net zero payment.\n- Variable cap\nIn a Variable cap method, the protection buyer is compensated for interest\nshortfall up to a floating rate such as LIBOR plus the default swap premium.\n- No cap\nIn this method, the protection buyer is compensated for the entire amount of\ninterest shortfall.\n\nThe 3 methods of interest shortfall treatment in a CDS is illustrated below:\n\nNote: The assumption is that the underlying security has coupon payment of 6%. The CDS has a\npremium of 25 basis point. For simplicity, the assumption is that the underlying security is\nsuffering 100% interest shortfall.\n\nUnder each method, any subsequent recovery of interest shortfall from the underlying\nsecurity triggers a pro-rated reimbursement back from the protection buyer to the\nprotection seller. The amount of this reimbursement is called \"Additional Fixed\nPayment.\"\n\n3. Principal shortfall\nA principal shortfall occurs when the reference CMBS fails to pay off principal by the\nlegal maturity date. This even is equivalent to the principal default of a structured finance\nsecurity.\n\nThe CDS contract in CMBS does not terminate on the occurrence of a credit event as in\nthe corporate world. Instead, it is structured on a \"Pay As You Go\" (PAUG) basis, which\ninvolves ongoing two-way payments over the life of the contract between the counter\nparties. Since the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) credit\nderivatives documentation standardization of the PAUG basis in June 2005, the market\nfor CMBS CDS has grown dramatically.\n\nThe PAUG also includes a provision for an option, called \"Physical Settlement Option,\"\nfor the protection buyer to terminate the contract by delivering the reference entity. This\nfeature is triggered by a credit event similar to the physical settlement under the corporate\nCDS contract. The contract terminates when the protection buyer physically delivers the\nfill notional amount.\n\nApplications and benefits: CDS contracts in CMBS have many useful applications.\nExpressing credit views\nBefore the introduction of credit default swap in CMBS, investors have no convenient\nmeans of expressing credit views on the market. With CMBS CDS, investors now have\nthe option to convert negative credit outlook into a position in CDS.\n\nHedging credit risk\nInvestors desire exposure to debt that is more risky because of the higher returns it offers.\nHowever, such exposure brings with it credit risk. This is when credit derivatives come in\nuseful. CMBS CDS allow investors to have gain or shed exposure unachievable in the\ncash market. CDS contracts can be used by CMBS conduits to hedge the pipeline of loans\nthey hold awaiting securitization against credit widening and negative credit\nperformance. Conduits historically hedge the risk of fluctuating Treasury rates and\nfluctuating interest rate swap rates, but they had no means to hedge against the risk of\nCMBS credit spreads widening.\n\nAccess to assets in restricted markets\nSome parts of CMBS capital structure such as mezzanine and non-investment grade are\ndifficult to access.\n\nDiversifying investment options\nThere is potential to create diversified portfolio through CMBS CDS trading. This would\nallow investors to be selective about CMBS exposure, leveraging their underwriting\ncapabilities.\n\nAbility to trade term unfunded CMBS credit exposure\nCMBS CDS provides a way for investors to trade term basis between CMBS CDS and\nCorporate CDS. Also, investors can trade capital structure term such as longing BBs and\nshorting BBBs.\n\nPotential protection buyers include\n- Hedge funds expressing a negative market view\n- High-yield real estate players looking to hedge specific exposures\n- Financial institution looking to reduce loan portfolio risk following mergers and\nacquisitions\nPotential protection sellers include\n- B-piece buyers interested in leveraging their underwriting capabilities\n- Traditional CMBS investors who cannot satisfy real estate allocation\nrequirements in cash markets\n- Structured vehicles looking for diversified exposure to higher-yielding CMBS\nassets\n\nThe role of index in derivatives market\nAs other derivatives products, the development of the CMBS credit derivatives highly\ndepends on the availability of a benchmarked index. One of the most significant events in\nthe CDS market was the launch of global indices for CDS of corporate credit risk in\n2004, which remarkably increased trading volumes and provided a strong platform for\nother index CDS products. Since then, the total notional amount in the credit derivatives\nmarket has more than quadrupled. The recent growth has finally expanded into a new\nsector: the CMBS market.\n\nThe introduction of CMBX1 index in March 2006 provides investors with a more liquid\nand standardized tool for trading and structuring a diverse pool of assets. CMBX is a\ntradable synthetic family of indices based on US CMBS securities consisting of six sub-\nindices, each based on the 25 most recently issued CMBS deals, where the notional\namount mirrors amortization of the reference bonds. The six index tranches are based on\nthe rating of the reference obligations, rated AAA through BBB-. A new series of CMBX\nis issued every six months. The CMBX reference entities are selected through an\nalgorithm that identifies the most recently issued deals over a minimum size of $700\nmillion, and which satisfy additional diversity requirements. The CMBX index uses the\nstandardized template based on the PAUG template published by the ISDA. The template\nfor CMBX trading is standardized with three floating amount events with a fixed cap for\nthe interest shortfall event. Market quotes are based on spread, not on price. Protection\nbuyers pay monthly premiums based on a predetermined fixed rate. Also, the CMBX\nindex contract does not include a physical delivery option for protection buyers.\n\nAn investment in a tranche of the CMBX index is technically analogous to entering into a\nseparate credit derivatives transaction on each of the 25 underlying reference obligations.\nThe index represents aggregate performance of a basket of credit default swaps.\n\n1 CMBX was launched by Markit Group Ltd., and CDS IndexCo LLC. Markit Group is a provider of independent\nmark-to-market pricing and valuations, and CDS IndexCo is a consortium of 16 investment banks licensed as market\nmakers. The market makers in the new CMBX index are Bank of America, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Credit Suisse,\nDeutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Nomura\nInternational, RBS, Greenwich Capital, UBS, and Wachovia. Markit serves as the Administration and Calculation\nAgent for the indices.\n\nPotential applications of CMBX: The new index benchmark for CDS of CMBS provides\ninvestors with additional benefits.\n\nWhile the CMBS CDS market allowed investors to express their views towards specific\nbonds, the approach is inefficient for investors who wish to express a view on an entire\nrating category of mortgages. For example, an investor may buy protection in one rated\nindex while sell protection in another rated index, expressing a relative value opinion\namong asset classes. The CMBX eliminates specific bond-level basis risk therefore\nprovides a more operationally efficient and low cost method of sector rotation trading.\nAnother possible strategy is to exploit relative value between the general market and\nspecific deals by taking a long-short position in single-name CMBS CDS and a CMBX\nindex. An investor would also separate spread risk and credit risk of the CMBS market by\nrolling into a new index series every six months.\n\nThe broad-based exposure of CMBX would allow investors who benchmark against a\nCMBS index to hedge their position without being influenced by bond-specific credit\nconcerns. The investors can then spend their time harvesting alpha through careful bond\nselection and either buying protection or selling under-perform cash bonds or selling\nprotection or buying outperform cash bonds. This strategy would help investors to\noutperform the given index.\n\nCDO managers would use the CMBX for managing their portfolios, either for a quick\nramp-up or by engaging in a long-short strategy. They can also engage in a hybrid deal\n\nwhere they can choose between cash and synthetic collateral to take advantage of asset\navailability and market spread levels.\n\nThe availability of the CMBX should result in increased efficiency in synthetically\ntrading and transferring the credit risk of commercial real estate market. The liquidity of\ntrading will increase trade flow, impact cash spreads, and eliminate arbitrage\nopportunities in the market. The readily available public information on construction and\ncalculation of the index will lead to increased investors' confidence and ensure\ntransparency. Quick dissemination of pricing information would lead to greater liquidity.\nThe standardized documentation for CMBX contracts will promote operational\nefficiency.\n\nWith the newly introduced CMBX index, a tradable index that tracks default risk of\nsecurities constructed from CMBS, it is hoped that the real estate synthetic debt market\nwill soon take off. The growth of a market in derivatives would go a long way towards\nfurther enhancing CMBS' reputation as a mainstream asset class in the fixed-income\nworld, driving financial capital into real estate.\n\nBibliography\nWhetten, Michiko. \"The CMBX: the Future is Here.\" Nomura Fixed Income Research\nMarch 23, 2006.\n\nAlan Todd and Yuriko Iwai. \"An Introduction to the CMBX.NA Index and Single-Name\nCMBS CDS.\" CMBS World Spring 2006.\n\nNeil Barve and Michael W.

In 1993, a group of\narchitects founded the Congress for the New Urbanism dedicated to \"creating buildings,\nneighborhoods, and regions that provide a high quality of life for all residents, while\nprotecting the natural environment\" (NU 2002). Nowadays, new urbanism has been\nconsidered as one important tool to fight against urban sprawl and has attracted\nincreasing interests among urban planners, architects, and developers. However, some\ncritical issues about new urbanism are still under debate or not adequately addressed. One\nsuch question is whether good urban form can be capitalized in the market. If good urban\nform provides higher quality of life, the monetary value of this effect will be reflected in\nthe property price, in addition to the value of other features such as structural attributes\nand neighborhood characteristics. The proposed study is to examine the impacts of urban\nform on property values using hedonic price analysis.\nSECTION II.\nREVIEW OF LITERATURE\nA. Literature Relevant to Urban Form Measures\nIn previous studies, many researchers generated various quantitative urban form\nmeasures. Their approaches vary in spatial resolution but generally employ a unit of\nanalysis that is too coarse to keep sufficient spatial details of urban form. In order to\nexamine development patterns and trends in Sacramento, California, and five comparable\ncities, Wassmer (2000) calculated share of metropolitan population, shares of\n\nemployment, retail sales, farmland, poverty rates, income level, employment rate and\ncommuting time for the central city, the central county, and the urbanized area\nrespectively. He concluded that Sacramento exhibits \"a high degree of relative\ndecentralization,\" and displays \"a high level of negative metropolitan outcomes generally\nassociated with a high degree of urban sprawl\". Galster et al (2001) defined urban sprawl\nbased on eight distinct dimensions of land use patterns: density, continuity, concentration,\nclustering, centrality, nuclearity, mixed uses, and proximity. They compared measures for\nsix dimensions and rank the level of urban sprawl for 13 urbanized areas. With the\ndevelopment of spatially disaggregate data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\ntools, more recent studies are conducted at more disaggregate level to improve the\nprecision of measures. To explore the relationship between urban form and property\nvalues, Song and Knaap (2003) used residential neighborhood level data to develop five\ndimensions of urban form measures: street design and circulation system, density, land\nuse mix, accessibility, and pedestrian access. Using a similar set of measures, Song (2005)\ncompared three study areas to determine how well their urban development patterns meet\nsmart growth principles. Rajamani et al. (2003) used neighborhood level urban form\nmeasures to assess the impacts of urban form on non-work trip mode choice.\nB. Literature Relevant to Hedonic Price Analysis and Property Values\nHedonic price analysis is a method of estimating demand or price for a good that does not\nhave a traditional economic market (Lipscomb 2007). It decomposes the item being\nresearched into its constituent characteristics, and estimates the value of each\ncharacteristic. In the case of housing, which is a heterogeneous bundled good, researchers\n\nhas been utilizing the hedonic pricing analysis to assess the implicit prices for a variety of\ncharacteristics associated with the property, such as structure components, environmental\nfactors, public services, urban form, etc.\nIn the environmental economics field, Kim, Phipps and Anselin (2003) developed a\nspatial-econometric hedonic housing price model to estimate the marginal value of\nimprovements in SO2 and NOX concentrations for the Seoul metropolitan area. They\nfound that SO2 pollution levels have a significant impact on housing prices while NOX\npollution doesn't. Hedonic price models are also used to examine the capitalization of\npublic services. Edel and Sclar (1974) and King (1977) indicated the need to include\nmeasures of public service and taxes paid in the hedonic price analysis. Using data from\nChicago for 1987-1991, Downes and Zabel (2002) estimated the impacts of school\ncharacteristics on house prices. They assigned to each house the school-level data for the\nclosest school, and found that school outputs, i.e., test scores, have significant impact on\nhouse price, while school inputs, i.e., per-pupil expenditures don't.\nHedonic price analysis is also widely applied to explore the relationship between urban\nform and property values. The implicit marginal prices of various urban form\ncomponents, such as land use mix (Cao and Cory 1981; Song and Knaap 2004), street\npattern (Guttery 2002), amenities (Shultz and King 2001; Benson et al 1998), proximity\nto transit stations and commercial centers (Bowes and Ihlanfeldt 2001; Song and Knaap\n2004), etc., have been evaluated by various researchers. Cao and Cory (1981) showed\nthat increasing industrial, commercial, multi-family and public land uses tends to\n\nincreasing surrounding home values. They thus concluded that an optimal land use mix\nshould be sought in locating economic activities into neighborhoods. Guttery (2002)\nexamined the sales price of 1,672 houses located in the Greater Dallas-Fort Worth-\nDenton metroplex and found negative impacts from having rear-entry alleyways. Benson\net al (1998) estimated the value of the view amenity in single-family residential real\nestate markets of Bellingham, Washington. Results from a hedonic price model suggest\nthat willingness to pay for the view amenity is quite high. Shultz and King (2001)\nprovided empirical evidence that proximity to the large protected natural areas, golf\ncourses, and Class II wildlife habitats, as well as the percentage of vacant and\ncommercial land use, positively influences housing values. Bowes and Ihlanfeldt (2001)\nlooked into both the direct and the indirect effects of transit stations on the attractiveness\nof nearby neighborhoods. They found that stations located away from downtown have\npositive impacts on property values, while stations in low-income neighborhoods or close\nto downtown generate negative externalities to nearby properties. Song and Knaap (2004)\nincorporated quantitative measures of mixed land uses for neighborhoods in Washington\nCounty, OR into hedonic analysis, and concluded that housing prices increase with their\nproximity to public parks or neighborhood commercial centers. In another comprehensive\nstudy with neighborhood level urban form measures, Song and Knaap (2003) found that\nsome features of new urbanism are capitalized into property values such as more\nconnective street networks, more streets, shorter cul-de-sacs, smaller block size, better\npedestrian accessibility to commercial uses, more evenly distributed mixed land uses and\nproximity to light rail stations. While features like higher density, containing more\ncommercial, multifamily, and public use (relative to single-family uses), and containing\n\nmajor transportation arterials are not attractive to property buyers.\nAll together, considerable research suggests that (1) hedonic price analysis is a powerful\ntool in assessing various components of housing value; and (2) certain elements of urban\nform can be capitalized into property values. However, some potential problems\nassociated with hedonic price analysis have not been fully addressed: (1) the spatial\nautocorrelation problem associated with the use of spatial data; and (2) the self-selection\nbias associated with the use of transaction based housing price data. The proposed study\nattempts to integrate advanced statistical techniques into the hedonic price models to get\nmore rigorous estimates of the impact of urban form on property values in the market.\nSECTION III.\nDATA\nThe main datasets used in the proposed study include Boston Sales of Residential\nProperty Data, Boston Parcel Data, Census demographic data, land use data, and\ntransportation data1.\nA. Boston Sales of Residential Property Data\nSales of Residential Property Data is a transaction-based dataset, containing parcel ID,\nsales price, address, sales date, living area, architectural style, and property type of each\nresidential sale in the City of Boston. The data source is Suffolk County Registry of\n1 Another transaction based housing price dataset from Warren Group may also be available for this study.\nIt records all the housing transactions in the Boston metropolitan area. The expansion of study area from\nCity of Boston to the Boston metropolitan area could increase the variations of urban form measures, hence\nimprove the outcomes of the proposed study.\n\nDeeds and City of Boston Assessing Department.\nB. Boson Parcel Data\nBoston Parcel Data from the City of Boston Assessing Department provide a rich set of\ninformation for over 100,000 parcels, including parcel ID, parcel size, assessing value,\ntax, etc. It can be used to generate asset-specific variables in the hedonic price analysis.\nC. Other Data Source\nLand use data, Census demographic data 2000, and Census Transportation Planning\nPackage (CTPP) data 2000 are also collected to generate related hedonic variables.\nSECTION IV.\nMETHODOLOGY\nIn the proposed study, we are to evaluate the virtues of urban form. Using Geographic\nInformation Systems (GIS) tools, we will develop quantitative measures of urban form at\nneighborhood level, and incorporate those measures in hedonic price analysis. Spatial\neconometric techniques will be applied to deal with the spatial 'spillover' effects. To\naddress the self-selection bias in the hedonic model, we will use a two-step estimate\nbased on the classic Heckman procedure. In essence, our research will decompose urban\nform into its component parts and estimate the implicit prices associated with each part in\nthe market place.\n\nA. Urban Forum Measures\nThis study will decompose urban form into several components based on previous\nliterature and quantify each component using GIS tools. Five major components\ncommonly advocated by the new urbanism design will be calculated: residential density,\nland use mix, accessibility, local street pattern, and pedestrian walkability.\n1) Residential Density\nDensity is an important indicator of urban form. A rich literature indicates that urban\nsprawl is characterized by low density single-family housing development, which leads to\nlower efficiency of land consumption and infrastructure investment, longer vehicle miles\ntraveled and loss of sense of community. Two density measures will be offered in the\nproposed study: density of single-family house and population density.\n2) Land Use Mix\nLand use mix measures the degree to which land uses are mixed and balanced within the\nneighborhood. Greater mix of uses is believed to facilitate walking and biking, reduce\nvehicle trips generated and vehicle miles traveled, and enhance urban aesthetics. The\ncommonly used measure of land use mix is land use entropy.\nLand use mix entropy = -∑\nJ Pj *ln(Pj )\n(1)\nj=1\nln(J )\nwhere J is the total number of land use categories. Pj is the proportion of land in the jth\nland use category. A value of 0 means the land in the neighborhood is exclusively\n\ndedicated to a single use, while a value of 1 indicates perfect mixing of the J land use\ncategories.\n3) Accessibility\nAccessibility measures the ease to reach amenities and service opportunities. Three\nmeasures of accessibility will be calculated in the proposed study: distance to retail\ncenters, distance to transit station, and distance to a public park.\n4) Local Street Pattern\nLiterature indicates that urban sprawl type of development contains too many winding\nstreets and cul-de-sacs, over-sized block, and poorly connected road network compared\nto the traditional grid-type street pattern, which leads to longer vehicle miles, worse air\nquality, less walking and biking activities. To show the differences between urban sprawl\nand traditional block pattern, we will use two indicators: average block parameter and\ntotal length of cul-de-sacs.\n5) Pedestrian Walkability\nThe amenity of pedestrian infrastructure may include lighting, planting, sidewalk\npavement, sidewalk width, curb situation, speed limit, etc. But most of them are not well\nrecorded. Two factors will be included in the proposed study: average sidewalk width and\nthe density of intersections along a path.\n\nB. Hedonic Price Model\nHedonic regression assumes that sales price or rent of a property is a function of\nstructural characteristics (S), neighborhood characteristics (N), location characteristics\n(L), contract characteristics (C), and the time rent or value is observed (T) (Malpezzi\n2002), as is shown in Equation (2).\nsale _ price = f (S, N, L,C,T )\n(2)\nA standard hedonic price model can be specified as:\nln(sale _ pricei ) = βixi + ε i\n(3)\nWhere xi is a vector of asset-specific characteristics of the properties (the hedonic\nvariables), ε is normally distributed mean zero random error.\nIn the proposed study, the hedonic variables will cover five subsets of factors.\n1) Structural Characteristics\nStructural characteristics of a house - such as living area, lot size, architectural style, etc.\n- are widely known to affect its value.\n2) Urban Form Characteristics\nThe urban form measures are discussed in the preceding section. Estimating their impacts\nis the major objective of the proposed study.\n3) Socioeconomic Characteristics\nResidents care about the socioeconomic status of their neighborhoods. To capture this\neffect, we include measures of racial composition and median household income.\n4) Location Characteristics\n\nLocation characteristics include the public service level and accessibility to employment\ncenters. Public service level can be measured with mean SAT score and Property tax rate.\nAccessibility to employment center can be measured with distance to the Central\nBusiness District (CBD).\n5) Sales Date\nTo capture the overall housing market fluctuation, the quarter when the property was sold\nwill be included in the model.\nC. Spatial Econometrics\nIn spatial data analyses, when a value observed in one location depends on the values at\nneighboring locations, there is a spatial autocorrelation. Since the price of a property may\nbe influenced by the characteristics of its neighboring properties, the proposed study also\nneed to take spatial effects into consideration. Spatial data may show spatial\nautocorrelation in the variables or error terms. Accordingly, this study will address the\nspatial autocorrelation with spatial-lag model and spatial-error model developed by Luc\nAnselin (1999).\nIn the spatial lag case, the dependent variable y in place i is affected by the independent\nvariables in both place i and its neighboring areas. With the existence of spatial lag, the\nassumption of uncorrelated error terms of Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation is\nviolated; in addition, the assumption of independent observations is also violated. As a\nresult, the OLS estimates are biased and inefficient. Spatial error means the error terms\n\nacross spatial units are correlated. With the presence of spatial error, the assumption of\nuncorrelated error terms of OLS is violated. Therefore, the OLS estimates are inefficient.\nIn the spatial lag model, 'spillover' means the values of independent variables in one\nlocation will affect the values of dependent variable in adjacent areas (Anselin 1999).The\nspatial lag can be addressed by adding an additional regressor in the form of a spatially\nlagged dependent variable to the regression, as is shown in Equation (4).\nY = ρWy + βX +ε\n(4)\nwhere Wy is the spatial lag variable, ρ is the autoregressive coefficient. A spatial lag of a\nspecified variable is computed by taking the weighted average of surrounding spatial\nunits. The weights can take different forms, for example contiguity based weights,\ndistance based weights, and K-nearest neighbor weights (Anselin 2003). The existence\nand magnitude of 'spillover' effects are indicated by the estimated value of the\ncoefficient for the spatial lag variable (autoregressive coefficient).\nA spatial-error model can be seen as a special case of a regression with a non-spherical\nerror term. The off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix express the structure of\nspatial dependence. The spatial error model can be estimated by:\nY = βX +ε ε = λWε + u\n(5)\nwhere u is an error term that meets the OLS assumptions, Wε is the weighted average of\nerror terms in neighboring areas. In the case of housing price, the spatial error model\nassumes that the spillover occurs indirectly through spatial correlation in the error terms\n\nfor neighboring properties. That is, the independent variables have only local effects, but\nfactors missing from the model specification are spatially correlated.\nThe spatial econometric techniques discussed in this section are based on approaches\nproposed by Luc Anselin (1999). There are still other approaches that could be utilized in\nthe proposed study, for example the Cokriging approach (Chica-Olmo 2007) and\nGeographically Weighted Regression approach (Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton\n2002). It would be interesting to compare the results of various approaches in dealing\nwith spatial autocorrelation.\nD. Heckman's Two-Stage Estimates\nThe sample used to estimate the hedonic price model are transaction based, consisting\nonly of properties sold in the market, where buyer's reservation prices are higher than\nseller's reservation prices. So they are not necessarily random draws from the population\nof properties. The possibility of sample selection bias arises when the unobserved\nproperty characteristics affecting the transaction sales propensity also influence the\ntransaction price level. To deal with the self-selection bias, the proposed study will\nfollow the method presented by Fisher, Geltner, and Pollakowski (2006), which is an\napplication of the Heckman's two-stage estimates (Heckman 1979). The reservation price\nequations for both the buyer side and the seller side, and transaction price for the sold\nproperties take the following forms:\nRPit\nb = ∑α b\nj X ijt +∑βt\nbZt +εit\nb\n(6)\ns\ns\ns\ns\nRPit = ∑α j X ijt +∑βt Zt +εit\n(7)\n\nPit = ∑α j X ijt +∑βtZt + (εit RPit\nb ≥ RPit\ns )\n(8)\nwhere Xijt is a set of j asset-specific characteristics of the properties including the\nstructural, urban form, socioeconomic, and location characteristics discussed in the\npreceding section, Zt is a vector of zero/one time-dummy variables (Zt = 1 in quarter t),\nRPit\nb ( RPit\ns ) is the natural logarithm of a buyer's (seller's) reservation price for property i\nas of time t, ε it\nb (ε it\ns ) is normally distributed mean zero random errors, and\nα j = 1 (α b\nj +α s\nj ), βt = 1 (βt\nb + βt\ns ),andεit = 1 (εit\nb +εit\ns ) (Fisher, Geltner, and Pollakowski\n2006).\nIt should be noted that the error term in Equation (8) may have a nonzero mean because\nthe observed transaction sample consists only of selected properties, i.e., properties\nwhose buyer reservation price is higher than seller reservation price. When\nE[(ε it RPit\nb ≥ RPit\ns ]= 0 , OLS regression using the observed data produces biased\nestimates of α and β . The standard treatment for the sample selection problem of this\ntype is Heckman's two-step estimates (Heckman, 1976, 1979). Heckman's procedure\nfirst uses all the properties to model the possibility that a property is sold with a probit\nmodel. A property is sold when the reservation price of the buyer is higher than that of\nthe seller. Use Sit\n* to denote the difference between the two reservation prices.\nSit\n* = RPit\nb - RPit\ns = ∑(α b\nj -α s\nj )X ijt +∑(βt\nb -βt\ns )Zt + (ε it\nb -ε it\ns )\n(9)\n= ∑π j X\n+∑γ tZt +ηit\nijt\nThe probability that a property i is sold can be modeled as:\n\nPr[Property i is sold] = Φ( ∑π j X\n+∑γ tZt )\n(10)\nijt\nWhere Φ ( ) is the cumulative density function of the normal distribution.\nThe results of the probit estimation can then be used to construct estimates of the inverse\nMills ratio ( λˆ\ni ), an instrumental variable to control for self-selection:\nλˆ\ni = Φ\nφ(\n(\n∑\n∑\nπ\nπ\nj\nj\nX\nX\nijt\nijt\n+\n+\n∑\n∑\nγ\nγ\nt\nt\nZ\nZ\n)\n)\n(11)\nwhere φ and Φ denote the probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution\nfunction (cdf) of the standard univariate normal distribution, respectively. When adding\nthe inverse Mills ratio λˆ into the hedonic price equation, the OLS estimates of α\ni\nand β will be unbiased and consistent (Fisher, Geltner, and Pollakowski 2006).\nSECTION V.\nSUMMARY\nIn summary, the proposed study will estimate the impacts of urban form on property\nvalues with hedonic price analysis using transaction data of residential properties in the\nBoston area. Neighborhood level urban form measures will be calculated with GIS tools\nand integrated into the hedonic price model. Furthermore, we attempt to address some\nimportant issues not well addressed in the literature with advanced statistical techniques:\n(1) spatial econometric methods, in particular spatial lag model and spatial error model,\nwill be used to deal with the spatial autocorrelation problem brought by the spatial data\nused in the analysis; (2) Heckman's two-step estimates will be used to fix the self-\nselection bias associated with transaction based property value data.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nAnselin, Luc. 1999. \"Spatial Econometrics\", Working Paper.\nAnselin, Luc. 2003. \"GeoDa 0.9 User's Guide.\"\nBenson, Earl D. et al. 1998. \"Pricing Residential Amenities: The Value of a View\", Journal of\nReal Estate Finance and Economics, 16: 1, 55-73.\nBowes, D.R. and K.R.

The probable reason is that it requires a full understanding of\nacademic theory as well as advanced techniques. In order to resolve this discrepancy,\nmany studies have been done to make the academic theory applicable and understandable\nfor developers in the real world. During the MSRED courses at MIT, I have learned two\ntypes of Excel spreadsheet based real options models: economics based model and\nengineering based model. In the MSRED thesis, I am going to examine the procedure of\nthese models and clarify the difference by comparing their results. As a goal, I hope to\ncreate a new, more practical real options model by integrating these two models. In this\npaper, I will examine the engineering based approach, mainly focusing on the demand\nprojection method in the model.\n\nIntroduction:\nIn recent years, the real options analysis gains more attention as an innovative\ndecision-making method in real estate industry. However, compared with other financial\nanalyses such as the NPV method, the real options analysis requires more advanced\n\n11.434/15.428J Shuichi Masunaga\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance and Investments May 21, 2007\nSpring 2007\n\nunderstanding of theory and mathematical techniques. Potentially because of that, the\nreal options analysis has not been fully utilized in the real world.\nAs far as I learned here at MIT, there are two types of acknowledged models for\nevaluating real options. One of them is a traditional, economics based model using the\nbinominal tree approach which we learned in Prof. David Geltner's Real Estate Finance and\nInvestments course in Fall 2006. The other is a relatively simple, engineering based\nmodel which has been developed by Prof. Richard de Neufville at MIT Engineering\nSystems Division. Both models are based on the Excel spreadsheet, but the concept and\nthe calculation procedure are slightly different between these two models.\nIn the economics based real options model, we estimate the value of \"wait\" options\nbased on binominal tree approach. We first calculate the expected value of the developed\nproperty based on traditional NPV method. Then, we estimate a certain amount of\nvolatility to the expected value (upside and downside). Also, we take the construction\ncosts growth into account. Based on other assumptions such as interest rates and the\nreturn of underlying asset, the spreadsheet model can show us the value of \"wait\" option,\nwhich equals to the optimal value of the developable land.\nOn the other hand, the engineering based model was created for the purpose of\nintroducing the \"academic\" real options theory into the real world. The model is also\nbased on Excel spreadsheet, and aims at making itself easily understandable for most\nengineers and managers without using difficult statistical data such as the volatility of the\n\n11.434/15.428J Shuichi Masunaga\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance and Investments May 21, 2007\nSpring 2007\n\nunderlying asset. Instead, the model requires simple inputs such as demand increase,\nand runs the Monte-Carlo simulation by using the built-in function of Excel software. From\nthe engineering point of view, this model allows the flexibility to be in the building structure\nin order to absorb the future demand by adding more buildings. By managing the\nuncertainty through the flexibility, this model enables designers and engineers to cut the\ndownside risks as well as maintain the upside potential. In general, this model is more\nintended to calculate \"expanding\" option value of the development project, and more\nsuitable for the design of infrastructure systems such as highways and parking garage\ndevelopment.\nFor the first step of my MSRED thesis, I will examine the engineering based real\noptions model in this paper, by using the parking garage case which has been introduced\nby Prof. Richard de Neufville in the class. I will mainly focus on the assumption of demand\nprojection, because that assumption is one of the most important components in this model.\n\nMethodology:\nIn this paper, I will extend the discussion based on the Excel spreadsheet model\nnamed \"de Neufville Garage Example Spreadsheet\", which was posted in the Stellar course\nwebsite. I will keep the all assumptions same except for the demand projection. As for\nthe demand projection, I will try to propose the way of setting the demand projection which\nis more intuitively understandable and more consistent with the reality. Then, I will\n\n11.434/15.428J Shuichi Masunaga\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance and Investments May 21, 2007\nSpring 2007\n\ncompare the results between the original demand projection and the proposed demand\nprojection.\n\nIntroduction to Parking Garage Case:1\n\nThe case deals with a multi-level car park for a commercial center in a region that\nis growing as population expands. The basic data are that:\n3⁄4\nThe deterministic point forecast is that demand on opening day is for 750 spaces, rises\nexponentially at the rate of 750 spaces per the first decade, and rises exponentially at\nthe rate of 500 spaces per the next decade;\n3⁄4\nAverage annual revenue for each space used is $10,000, and the average annual\noperating cost for each space available (often more than the spaces used) is $2,000;\n3⁄4\nThe lease of the land costs $3.6 Million annually;\n3⁄4\nThe construction will cost $16,000 per space for pre-cast construction, with a 10%\nincrease for every level above the ground level;\n3⁄4\nThe site is large enough to accommodate 200 cars per level; and\n3⁄4\nThe discount rate is taken to be 12%, and the time horizon for the NPV calculation is\ntaken to be 15 years.\n3⁄4\nLand leasing cost ($3,600,000/year) is paid upfront at the beginning of each year. No\npayment is made at the end of the last year.\n\n1 The explanation of most assumptions has been quoted from the \"ReadMe\" tab of the\nspreadsheet.\n\n11.434/15.428J Shuichi Masunaga\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance and Investments May 21, 2007\nSpring 2007\n\n3⁄4\nIn this paper, the initial levels of the parking are assumed to be six.\nAdditionally, economic analysis needs to recognize that actual demand is uncertain, given\nthe long time horizon. The case assumes that future demand could be 50% off the\nprojection, either way, and that the annual volatility for growth is 15% of the long-term\naverage.\nThe owners can design stronger footings and columns to the original building so\nthat they can add additional levels of parking easily. In this case, it has been assumed that\nthe owners will expand one level of the garage if the demand excesses the capacity in the\npast continuous two years.\n\nValue of Flexibility:\n\nFirst, if we do not assume any volatility in the future demand, the demand shows\nan exponential upward curve as illustrated in Exhibit 1. Based on this static demand, the\nproject NPV is calculated to be £2,685.886.\n\n11.434/15.428J Shuichi Masunaga\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance and Investments May 21, 2007\nSpring 2007\n\nDemand Projection\nTime (years)\nDemand (spaces)\n\nExhibit 1. Static Demand Projection\n\nThen, if we assume the volatility of the future demand, the graph moves above or\nbelow the static demand projection curve, and the example of this relationship is shown in\nExhibit 2. Under this particular example, the project NPV is negative £2,022,784. Also,\nfrom the Exhibit 3 which shows 2,000 times of Monte-Carlo simulation of the project NPV,\nthe mean of NPV is £1,530,251, lower than the NPV under the static demand projection.\nThis result is due to the limitation of upside potential, since the garage size has been\nassumed not to be able to expand according to the demand increase.\n\n11.434/15.428J Shuichi Masunaga\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance and Investments May 21, 2007\nSpring 2007\n\nDemand\nTime (years)\nDemand (spaces)\nDemand projection\nDemand scenario\n\nExhibit 2.

Although this model is easily\nunderstandable and highly informative, it might be a little difficult to set the appropriate\nassumptions of volatility. At the same time, this assumption of volatility is one of the most\ninfluential components in this model. Therefore, here I would like to propose a simpler and\npotentially better way of assuming the volatility for future demand. The three steps to form\nthe proposed method follow below.\n1. Use the same assumptions for the deterministic demand on the first year (750 spaces),\nand the exponential increase during the first decade (750 spaces) and during the next\ndecade (500 spaces).\n2. Calculate the \"base\" demand growth projection based on the demand projection\ncalculated above.\n3. Assume the annual volatility for each year's demand which is projected based on the\nbase demand growth.\n4. When calculating next year's demand, start the calculation from the previous year's\nrealized demand calculated by this method.\n\n11.434/15.428J Shuichi Masunaga\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance and Investments May 21, 2007\nSpring 2007\n\nRealized demand in year T\nDT = DT-1 * (1+GT) * (1 - V + 2 * V * RAND())\nwhere\nDt = realized demand at year t (£)\nGt = \"base\" demand growth projection at year t (%)\nV = annual volatility for demand (%)\nRAND() = random number between 0 and 1 (uniform distribution)\n\nFrom now on, I will call the original method of demand projection as \"Scenario 1\",\nand the proposed method as \"Scenario 2\". Exhibit 5 shows the result of the demand\nprojections by two scenarios.2 Due to the difference of the method, the demand curve of\nscenario 2 is more \"smoothed\", while the demand curve of scenario 1 is rather \"random\nwalk\". Considering the cyclical movement of the real estate market, I believe that scenario\n2 can reflect the demand movement in a more realistic way. Moreover, since scenario 2\nuses only one assumption for the volatility, I believe that it will make the demand projection\neasier and more foreseeable.\n\n2 In Exhibit 5, annual volatility has been assumed to be 15% in scenario 2.\n\n11.434/15.428J Shuichi Masunaga\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance and Investments May 21, 2007\nSpring 2007\n\nDemand\nTime (years)\nDemand (spaces)\nDemand projection\nDemand scenario 1\nDemand scenario 2\n\nExhibit 5. Example of Demand Projection of two scenarios\n\nComparison of two scenarios:\n\nIn order to find out the equivalent volatility level that makes the result f scenario 2\nnearly equal to that of scenario 1, I compared the calculated NPVs by both scenarios under\nthe inflexible garage case.

      "content": "Patrick Rowe\nAdvanced Topics in Real Estate Finance\n\nCross-Sectional Analysis of Real Estate Cap Rates: Market pricing of\nexpected income growth\n\nAbstract:\nEmpirical data and previous research have shown that capitalization rates vary across\ndifferent MSA markets as well as between different product types. The cause of these\nvariations is not fully understood however. Theory would suggest that the cause of\nvariation should be income growth expectations, or risk variation. Surprisingly, ex-post\ndata comparing income growth and cap rates shows almost no correlation between cap\nrates and ex-post income growth. This data suggests that the market is somehow\ninefficient, or that the market has historically done a poor job of anticipating future\nincome changes. This paper will further explore capitalization differences across markets\nby exploring several different proxies for future income growth including historic rental\ngrowth, anticipated rental growth based on Torto Wheaton data, and ex-post actual rental\ngrowth. The intent of this research is to develop a better understanding of how the\nmarket prices risk and future rent growth expectations. A better understanding of these\nfactors will hopefully lead to the development of an investment strategy that will\ncapitalize on the market inefficiencies and poor ability to predict future income growth.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe objective of this paper is to better understand real estate market pricing and to\ndevelop an investment strategy to take advantage of apparent market pricing\ninefficiencies. One measure of pricing comparison that is frequently used in real estate is\nthe capitalization rate or cap rate. Cap rates represent the ratio of NOI to price for real\nestate assets. Amongst other factors, cap rates are influenced by required rates of return,\nincome growth expectations, and market risk perceptions.\n\nBoth income growth and investment risk are significantly impacted by local market\nfactors such as supply and demand market dynamics, economic factors, and future supply\nconsiderations. Due to the local nature of real estate markets, future cash flow forecasts\nfor a property are significantly influenced by these local market factors. While many\nmarkets can be affected by general or national market factors such as economic\nconditions or interest rates, the cash flow of a property are nevertheless the results of the\nimpact of both national and local factors on the local space market.\n\nThis paper will employ a cross-sectional geographic anslydid. The paper will include a\ncomparative analysis of the twenty largest markets for apartments as well as the twenty\nlargest markets for office buildings. The paper will review data at two points in time,\n1996 and 2001 for comparison purposes to asses any differences across time. For each\nmarket, several proxies will be tested as potential dependent variables that affect cap rates.\nThe focus of this paper is on projected income growth. However, in order to isolate the\nmarket's pricing of future income growth, we must attempt to control for risk which can\n\naffect the market's required rate of return, and hence cap rate. Therefore, a multi-\nvariable regression analysis will be performed including several proxies for market risk.\n\nFinance theory suggests that the market price and hence cap rate should be significantly\nimpacted by expected future income growth. Some empirical evidence suggests that the\nmarket does a poor job of pricing future income growth, but that does not mean that the\nmarket does not attempt to do this. In an attempt to determine what factors the market\ndoes consider in predicting future income growth, this paper will test several potential\nfactors.\n\nOne of the three main income growth proxies that will be tested is the annualized income\ngrowth over the past five years. This factor is meant to test if the market appears to be\nmyopic and whether or not it expects recent history to repeat itself in the near future. A\nsecond income growth proxy that will be tested is the Torto-Wheaton rental growth\nprediction. This factor will be testing whether or not the market is pricing future\nexpectations of the market analysts who analyze local market factors and predict future\nincome growth. The third factor that will be tested is ex-post actual income growth. This\nis intended to assess whether or not the market somehow prices future income growth\nbetter than market analysts.\n\nIn addition to the three main growth proxies, the paper will also test several other factors\nwhich the market is anecdotally known to consider. These factors include absorption,\nvacancy rate, supply constraint factors, projected employment growth and potentially\n\nseveral others. In theory, all of these factors should be considered by the market and the\ncombined effect of these should result in the projected or expected income growth.\nWhile this is theoretically how the market should develop expectations, it is possible that\nthis is not the case and that the market is somehow overly simplistic or unsophisticated in\nits understanding of future income projections. The intent of this paper is to better\nunderstand how the market actually prices assets and projects future income growth.\n\nLiterature Review:\n\nThere has been a small amount of cross-sectional cap rate research relative to some other\nareas of the real estate research field. Despite this, there have been several important\npapers whose research is relevant to this topic and whose findings have influenced this\npaper. While these papers don't have the exact same focus as this paper, they are\nnevertheless important to understand on a basic level.\n\nOne of the more important papers to explore differences in cap rates across markets was\n(Sivitanidou and Sivitanides 1999). This study compared differences in office market\ncap rates between markets from 1985 to 1995 in an attempt to assess what factors go into\ndetermining cap rates. This paper drew two important conclusions that are relevant for\nthis paper: 1) it confirmed that markets are indeed priced differently and that changes in\ncap rates in individual markets are idiosyncratic, implying that local space market factors\ninfluence cap rates and pricing. The graph below from this paper illustrates the cap rate\nchanges over time for several markets.\n\n2) the second important conclusion from this paper is that local markets appear to have\ntime variant and time invariant factors that affect local cap rates. Examples of time\ninvariant factors include employment concentration in a single sector, or percentage of\ngovernment jobs. These factors may be important in assessing the perceived riskiness of\na market which must be understood due to the likely impact of required rates of return in\nthat market. This concept is important in terms of separating short term expectations of\nincome growth from long term market specific risk factors that affect risk and return\nrequirements and differences across markets.\n\nAnother important paper (Yisheng Yu 2004) explored the variation in cap rates across\nsub-markets within the Atlanta office MSA. The findings of this study included the fact\nthat the market does care about individual space market factors as well as property\nspecific attributes such as age and construction type. \"Movements of market-specific\nCh\na\nr\nt\n\nshowin\ng offi\nce cap\nitaliz\nation\nrates\namong\nlarge\ncities\n.\n\ncapitalization rates are shaped by local office market features, including space stock level,\nabsorption rate, and past rate of rental income growth. These features result persistent\ndifferent capitalization rates across submarkets in this case.\" This finding confirms that\ndifferences in local market factors affect cap rates, even at a sub-market level.\nInterestingly, in contrast to the graph shown above, movements in capitalization rates at a\nsub-market level appear to have an extremely high correlation and move simultaneously.\n\nAnother interesting finding of this paper was that past rental growth was found to have a\nnegative impact in unity on cap rates. This would suggest that the market is likely not\n'backward looking' and that further exploration is warranted to test this possibility.\n\n(Pai 2006) is an MIT thesis that attempted to develop an equilibrium pricing model that\nwould accurately predict real estate prices. The papers' findings showed significant\nimpact on pricing from several factors including market size, property price, and property\ntype. In addition to determining that these specific factors are relevant to market pricing,\n\nit also discovered that many of the relationships apparent in the way the market prices\nassets are surprisingly the opposite of commonly accepted principals of both investment\nand property markets. The factor that was found to be most important in determining real\nestate asset prices was the property type. The graph below shows the grouping by type,\nas well as the curious result of apartments having smaller Betas and yet earning higher\nreturns historically.\n\nWhile this paper did not explicitly perform a cross-sectional analysis, it still provides\nimportant insights into how the market appears to price real estate and what factors\nshould be considered in this cross-sectional analysis.\n\nThe most recent study was that done by (Chichernea, Miller, Fisher, Sklarz, White 2007).\nThis study is also the most similar to the topic of this paper as it specifically addresses the\ncauses of cap rate differences across markets. This paper studied cap rate variations\n\nacross markets for apartments using transactional data from RCA. One of the important\nfindings of this paper was that supply side factors have a significantly larger impact on\ncap rates than demand side growth forecasts. This implies that the market places a\nsignificant premium on supply constrained markets. The other related finding of this\nstudy that is important is that there doesn't appear to be a demand side impact on pricing.\nThis means that increases in expected future demand for apartment in the space market\ndoesn't appear to be being priced into apartment prices significantly. This is a surprising\nand important result. A third finding of this study is that market size or liquidity has a\nsignificant impact on pricing. This finding supports findings of (Sivitanidou and\nSivitanides 1999) related to office prices.\n\nProgress- Market evolution and sophistication\nOne of the important aspects of this research that makes it particularly relevant is the\ncontinued evolution of the real estate industry. The market appears to be evolving in two\nimportant and distinct ways that are having significant impacts on real estate prices and\nmarkets. One important evolution is the continued refinement and understanding of how\nthe space market works. Through increased scrutiny as well as additional data, the\nmarket has developed a much better understanding of the space market dynamics.\n\nIt has been argued that the increased understanding of the space market has resulted in\nmore prudent and restrained lending practices, specifically related to development.\nHistorically, excess development or over-production of supply is the primary factor that\nhas lead to the historic cyclicality and volatility of rents in the space market. Recent\n\nincreases in valuation have not resulted in the significant building boom that has\npreviously been seen in previous cycles. This is potentially an indication of a more\nsophisticated development market. It remains to be seen whether or not the cyclicality of\nrents will potentially diminish.\n\nIn addition to the space market's evolution, the financial market also appears to have\ndeveloped an increased understanding of real estate as an investment asset class. The\nincreased attention from the financial markets on real estate has had important impacts on\nproperty values. This has included significant reductions in cap rates over the past\nseveral years, as well as an improved understanding of the value of real estate in a well-\ndiversified portfolio. This trend can be conceptualized as the slow merger of real estate\nand Wall Street. With this trend, Wall Street is bringing increased scrutiny and\nsophistication as well as brainpower and capital to the pricing of real estate.\n\nIn my opinion, the upshot of the evolution of both the space and financial markets will be\nan increasingly efficient asset pricing market for real estate. The real estate market is\ngoing through a transition period where it is changing from a somewhat inefficient to an\nincreasingly efficient market. One of the important aspects of this evolution is the ability\nof the market to understand and predict future income growth changes due to the local\nmarket dynamics.\n\nThis paper is an attempt to employ sound strategies and analytical tools to increase the\nunderstanding of real estate prices. This sort of methodology is meant to be important\n\nboth for academics understanding of real estate markets as well as being relevant to\nactive market practitioners. For market practitioners, the current real estate market prices\nstill appear to demonstrate characteristics of inefficiencies that can be interpreted as\nopportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe goal of this research will be to first understand the differences between theoretical\nmodels and actual pricing models used by the market. The paper's other main objective is\nto analyze the potential opportunities presented by the current pricing practices of real\nestate. If the inefficiencies in pricing are consistent and can be better understood, an\ninvestment strategy can be developed to capitalize on the inefficiencies. By analyzing the\ndata from 1996 and 2001, I will attempt to extrapolate to the current market and attempt\nto identify undervalued markets. The development of an investment strategy based on\nthis research will hopefully be an impetus for furthering the market's understanding of\naccurate real estate pricing models and a way to increase the sophistication and accuracy\nwith which real estate should be priced based on the space market fundamentals."

Market Overview\nCommercial real estate is an important asset class, but does not yet have a well developed\nderivatives market in the US. The use of derivatives could improve the functioning of the real\nestate industry as a whole and this has resulted in significant interest in the development of US\ncommercial property derivatives by key players in all sectors.\nIn 2005, the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) entered in to an\nagreement with Credit Suisse (CS), which gave them an exclusive agreement to trade derivatives\nin the form of swaps on the NCREIF NPI Index. However, significant trading did not materialize\nand CS relinquished the license in October of 2006. NCREIF recently licensed seven US\ninvestment banks and the market has slowly started trading again and it appears that the market is\non the brink of a period of rapid growth. The US commercial real estate sector is estimated to be\nan $ 8 trillion dollar market and use of property derivatives would allow investors to implement\nstrategies such as hedging market risk, asset allocation, sector rebalancing, international\ndiversification and gaining Alpha.\nDerivatives also offer benefits such as low transaction cost, quick execution, the ability to sell\nshort and allow investors to gain or reduce exposure to the commercial real estate asset class\nwithout directly buying or selling properties.\n\nThe increased liquidity and reduced up front capital requirements provide added flexibility in\nexecuting real estate investment strategies and managing risk.\nA number of barriers still exists that hinder the successful implementation and growth of real\nestate derivatives in the US commercial real estate market. But, the market has the ability to\neducate and guide the investor and end user in order to overcome these barriers and facilitate the\nsuccessful development of the derivatives market. The knowledge gap between finance and real\nestate needs to be bridged and end users need to understand the specific problems that derivatives\ncould address in investment and management decisions.\nThe following paper provides a brief overview of the barriers that hinder the growth of a synthetic\nmarket that is on the brink of expanding.\na) Overview of Derivatives:\nA derivative is an asset that derives its value from an underlying index or asset e.g. options,\nfutures, swaps. A number of derivative products has been widely used and traded for years e.g.\nstock options, commodity futures and interest rate swaps. The advent of direct real estate equity\nderivative products has created the opportunity for similar applications in the US real estate\nmarket. These derivative products are essentially based on commercial-property periodic return\nindexes, and offer futures contracts to allow for synthetic investment and hedging of real-estate\nmarket exposure, specifically focused in the commercial real estate sector.\nMore specifically, following are three examples of real estate derivative products being offered\nby Credit Suisse in the US and they are all written in the form of swaps on the NCREIF NPI\nindex as mentioned earlier.\n\nThey are as follows:\n1. Capital Return Swaps, based on the capital value component of the NPI\n2. Property Type Total Return Swap, based on the total return (capital value + income) on\nthe property type sub-indices\n3. Total Return Swap, based on the NPI total return (capital value + income)\nA swap contract is based on a notional amount agreed upon between the two parties to a contract,\nand at the end of each quarter, cash payments based on this amount is exchanged according to the\nperformance of the underlying NPI index. The contract is specified upfront for a number of years.\nb) Benefits to Investors:\nCommercial real estate derivatives offer a number of direct benefits to investors and potential end\nusers in the market. However, previous efforts to develop a real estate derivatives markets failed\nfor a variety of reasons that will be discussed in more detail later in the paper.\nDerivatives would allow investors to overcome the main disadvantages of private real estate\ninvestment, including high transaction cost, long transaction lead time and the lack of liquidity.\nOnce the issues of liquidity, number of dealers and indices have been addressed through active\neducation, investors will be able to position themselves efficiently on both the short and long side\nof a market. This will allow for more efficient pricing and added flexibility in executing real\nestate investment strategies.\n\nII. Understanding the Growth & Development of the Real Estate Derivatives Market - The\nUS Model\nThe slow emergence of a housing derivatives market in the U.S and the commercial property\nderivatives in the U.K has created interest in the development of the U.S commercial derivatives\nmarket. NCREIF has also provided licenses to seven leading investment banks (March of 2007)\nto use NPI index for financial derivative transactions on U.S. commercial real estate. The\nagreements are specifically aimed at enhancing liquidity and transparency in the property\nderivatives market and will expand an NPI licensing initiative introduced by NCREIF in 2005.\nAll these factors indicate that the derivatives market for US commercial real estate sector appears\nto be ready for rapid growth if barriers to development could be addressed successfully.\nOvercoming these barriers could offer many of the same risk management options that have been\navailable to investors in stocks, bonds and commodities.\nIII. Analyzing the Barriers to Growth in the US Market\nAccording to a recent MIT thesis (2006)1 the major concerns of investors are lack of secondary\nmarkets for real estate derivatives, liquidity, pricing, lack of dealers and confusion amongst\ndealers of which US index to use. A number of other issues have also been discussed by\ninvestors and academics at a recent Real Estate Derivatives conference in New York. Amongst\nthese were education, fund mandates, tax & accounting principles and again the issue of\npricing.\n1 Lim, J. Y and Zhang, Y. (2006). A Study on Real Estate Derivatives\n\nFirstly, let's review the issue of US indices. Users of commercial real estate derivatives will have\nthe option to choose from a menu of indices that are based on factors such as accuracy, frequency\nand a range of coverage. Three of the five US indices are transaction based (RCA, GRA and TBI),\none uses appraisals (NPI) and the remaining index utilizes rent data (REXX).\nEach of the indices has its own characteristics and suitability for use in the market and differences\nbetween the indices over any given quarter can be quite large. Also, appraisal based indices have\nmore lag but less volatility than a transaction based index. The NCREIF NPI index is currently\nthe closest to the European Investment Property Data bank (IPD) index. It is important to note\nthat the NPI consists of both equity and leveraged properties, but the leveraged properties are\nreported on an unleveraged basis.\nSecondly, liquidity and lack of dealers go hand in hand. Professor David Geltner (MIT) noted\nthe \"chicken and the egg problem\" - that users are reluctant to enter the market due to a lack of\nliquidity and, at the same time, liquidity providers are hesitant because of the few users.\nEducating both sides of the market and providing strong leadership by reputable market\nparticipants will provide the only immediate solution and create a greater sense comfort with the\ntrading of derivatives at this point in time. There is a huge need for the end users to be educated\nand understand the implication of positioning themselves on the both the short and the long side\nof the market.\nThirdly, efficient pricing of derivatives is one of the most important considerations and requires\nknowledge of both derivatives and indices. This again brings us back to the issue of educating the\nmarket, but in the end it, is still currently an OTC market and two parties can agree to whatever\nthey want. The market has an important role to play in addressing the regulatory barriers to\ngrowth and promote the use of derivatives.\n\nTwo examples of these barriers are fund mandates and tax/accounting principles. In the UK\nprior to 2002 many fund mandates prohibited funds from trading property derivatives. Rupert\nClark, Head of Property at Hermes UK (70Bn under management), was a big proponent for the\nuse of derivatives, but had to actively work on changing fund mandates over the course of 2002 -\n2004, in order to trade property derivatives.\nIV. Understanding the Mechanics Behind Real Estate Derivatives - The UK Model\nReal estate derivatives have existed in the UK for more than a decade and the market has actively\nworked to overcome the initial barriers to efficient market development and growth. However, it\nhas only been the last two years' growth in volume that has proven that the market is increasing\nin liquidity, dealers and overall confidence. According to IPD the total cumulative notional\namount traded in the first quarter of 2007 in the UK is 6,512,000,000 GBP. Most of the trades to\ndate are Property Index Certificates (PIC's) or total return swaps traded against LIBOR, for a\nterm between one and three years on the IPD. It is important to note that it took the market over\nten years to develop to this point.\nThe UK market has addressed pricing and education issues head on. Top financial firms often\nteam up real estate and financial brokers to sell derivatives in order to bridge the gap between\ncorporate finance and real estate. A number of the largest institutional firms such as Hermes and\nPrudential, in combination with IPD and Investment Property Forum have encourage the marked\ndevelopment in property derivatives by taking an active role in educating investors via training\nevents and conferences.\nThe US has always been at the forefront of innovative financial development but the UK has\nclearly shown faster market growth over the past decade.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for the speed of general acceptance and use of property derivatives\nin the UK. Firstly, the market is more comfortable with the IPD index (as opposed to the NPI\nindex in the US) due to the long standing respect of the appraisal profession in the UK. Secondly,\nreal estate transaction cost tends to be higher in the UK than in the US, which ultimately makes\nderivatives use more attractive in the UK. Thirdly, one of the major benefits is the large number\nof UK investment banks that are licensed to trade property derivatives, and this essentially allows\nfor more efficient price discovery which in turn increases liquidity.\nV. Risks Associated With Real Estate Derivatives: The Issue with Pricing\nAs discussed earlier, pricing is arguably the most importance issue in real estate derivatives and\nthe literature on pricing of derivatives is somewhat limited. In a recent MIT Thesis (2006)2 two\nmethods of pricing were discussed: one method through arbitrage and the other through\nequilibrium analysis. The arbitrage method's assumptions made the analysis too strict and\nunrealistic, while equilibrium pricing proved to be a more intuitive. The authors stated that\nequilibrium pricing was based on the principle that the \"expected total return risk premium per\nunit of risk should be contact within and across the relevant asset markets.\"\nPricing in the market may still purely be return based, and if real estate derivatives are a more\nliquid way to invest in real estate, shouldn't the price also reflect a liquidity premium? Finally,\nthe lagging nature of appraisal based indices reduces the risk associated with investing in an\nindex and this could also affect pricing.\nEven considering all the abovementioned issues, pricing in the current market appears to be\ndriven by supply and demand in the marketplace.\n2 Lim, J. Y and Zhang, Y. (2006). A Study on Real Estate Derivatives\n\nAn increase in the number of market participants will allow for a unified view and essentially\nmore efficient pricing of derivatives that could lead the underlying real estate market.\nVI. Expected US Market Growth & Market Expansion\nAre US buyers and lenders ready for derivative products to truly hedge their investments? For\nthe first time choices exist, but does the end user know which management and investment\nproblems derivatives could address. According to one speaker at the recent Derivatives\nConference in NY the main obstacles to overcome are as follows:\nMarket education is still a crucial factor to address. Educators need to focus on the liquidity\nprovider, brokers, index provider and end user so that clients can identify how derivatives could\noffer solutions their current investment and management problems. A number of regulatory issues\nalso need to be address such as capital gains, hedge accounting and foreign investor treatment.\nThe benefits to foreign investors are huge and they need to clearly understand how to access\ninternational markets and opportunities.\nThe market also needs to encourage end-user involvement by identifying exactly which parties\nwill be the early adopters and how they could position themselves through derivatives e.g.\npension funds, private equity, hedge funds etc. One simply cannot compare derivative transaction\ncost to the cost of buying and selling real estate; and only through greater availability of pricing\ninformation to end users will crossover investors become dedicated investors.\n\nVII. Conclusion\nUltimately, commercial real estate derivatives will allow the physical side of the commercial-\nreal-estate industry to function less inhibited by the investment side of the industry. Decisions\nmade regarding the management and development of the physical asset will no longer be\nconstrained by the needs of investors who essentially lack expertise and interest in real estate as a\nphysical asset and rather make their decisions based on the investment criteria of the money\nproviders.This will allow developers and managers to generate greater profit opportunities by\nutilizing their expertise and skills to focus in their areas of expertise and generate a positive alpha.\nAlso, investors whose interest in real estate is purely financial will be able to execute their\nstrategies more efficiently, with lower transaction cost, management cost and the opportunity for\nmore efficient diversification.\nThe market shows potential for real growth but we have a long way to go in educating both the\nmarket, the end user, and overcoming the current barriers to development in the US real estate\nderivatives market."
