Through focused lectures, students are instructed in the fundamentals of the ocean environment, chemical sampling and analysis, and measurement and instrumentation. They apply these techniques in the field and the laboratory; through the semester, students also fabricate and test a specialized sensor and data logger. Written and oral reports are required of the students.\n\nSubject Overview\n\nThere are three main elements to the course: Oceanic Chemical Sampling and Analysis, Instrumentation Development for the Ocean Environment, and the Larger Field of Ocean Science.\n\nChemical Sampling and Analysis\n\nThe subject begins with a day trip to Boston Harbor and Buzzards Bay aboard the WHOI coastal research vessel, the R/V Tioga. During this field trip, we will be collecting a series of water samples for analysis during this course. We will teach you some of the basic measurements that are standard for environmental analysis, including nutrient analyses and contaminant analyses. You will conduct each measurement on a subset of Boston Harbor samples and will be taught how to interpret the data. You will examine all the data collected by you and your classmates; each student will present a subset of the data and interpret it in the context of other data collected by the class. At the end of the course, you will have generated a chemical and physical snapshot of Boston Harbor and its surroundings.\n\nInstrumentation\n\nEarly in the subject, you are introduced to a data logging micro-processor and a water-depth sensor which will be used to measure tidal range off Woods Hole. We provide the necessary background to understand and implement the sensor. A portion of the available laboratory time in the subject is devoted to your building and testing the device - it will be field tested twice during your stay in Woods Hole.\n\nOcean Science\n\nThe goal is for students taking the course to gain an appreciation for how science is done in the ocean, and why. Drawing on current problems in the field, such as deep ocean circulation, carbon cycles, erosion, global warming, and energy, we will discuss throughout the semester how science can be applied to understand issues and support rational decisions.\n\nInstructors\n\nDr. Elizabeth Kujawinski, Assistant Scientist, Dept of Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry, WHOI\n\nDr. Sheri White, Assistant Scientist, Dept of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering, WHOI\n\nDr. Franz Hover, Principal Research Engineer, Dept of Mechanical Engineering, MIT\n\nThe course is sponsored by the MIT Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, the MIT Center for Ocean Engineering and the WHOI Academic Programs Office.\n\nRequired Materials\n\nComposition notebook with lines - this notebook must be brought to each lab session.\n\n3-ring binder for all laboratory handouts.\n\nLaptop computer (optional).\n\nGrading\n\nThe course is P/F. Students will be evaluated based on completion of the assigned laboratory work, data reduction and analysis from laboratory exercises, and a final report / presentation on the students' sampling device.",

      "content": "Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nSubject 12.097\nHOMEWORK 1\nAssigned 9 January 2006\nDue 17 January 2006\n1. Tradeoffs and optimization are demonstrated by the following real-world example in mobile\nrobots. An autonomous underwater vehicle carries an energy source of E = 1.5 kiloWatt-hours,\ne.g., a 30kg Li-polymer battery. At operating speed U , the drive motors consume Pd = 40U 3\nWatts, because the drag force scales with the speed squared, and power is speed times force.\nAdditionally, no matter what the speed, the \"hotel\" load of the robot - the computers, sensors,\ncommunication equipment, etc. - is Ph = 8 Watts. What speed should the robot travel so as to\nachieve the greatest distance, how long does this mission last, and how far does the robot go in\nthis case? Hint: Express the distance travelled as a function of speed and find the derivative; the\noptimum is at a zero derivative point. You can also solve this by brute force with a spreadsheet!\n2. Hydrostatic pressure is an important environmental consideration in any system that has to\noperate at depth. Using the fact that the density of seawater is about 1025kg/m3, estimate the\nhydrostatic pressure on an object deployed at depths of ten, one hundred, one thousand, and ten\nthousand meters.\nThe implosion of a pressure vessel at large depths is extremely dangerous because of the huge\npressure waves that are created. To get an idea of the energy involved, first calculate the amount\nof energy \"stored\" in the evacuated volume. The simplest way to think of this is that a small\npump had to work against the pressure to evacuate the sphere; the energy is the pressure times\nthe volume evacuated. Use a diameter of 43cm for a glass sphere; what is the energy for each of\nthe four depths you used above?\nWhen the implosion occurs, the sphere is quickly \"eliminated,\" i.e., turned into glass chips, and the\nsurrounding water comes rushing in under great pressure. Because water is a compressible medium,\nthe colliding masses reflect and then radiate pressure waves outward. An experiment in crushing\nglass spheres is reported by Orr and Schoenberg (J. Acoustical Soc. of America, 59:1155-9, 1974),\nwherein at about 3km depth, 43cm spheres generate pressure peaks of -2M P a and +10M P a at\none meter distance, both relative to hydrostatic. The positive pulse occurs for a typical time of 0.2\nmilliseconds! What nearly instantaneous depth change is the 10M P a equivalent to? What force is\nthis acting on a 10cm-by-10cm square? Unfortunately pressure scales outward only inversely with\nradius (not r2), so even at ten meters away, this is big trouble.\n3. Buoy Design. Consider two buoys, both of mass 1000kg. One is long and slender, with a circular\ncross-section of 20cm diameter. The other is short and disc-like, with a circular cross-section of\n1.2m. On flat water, the buoys when perturbed will oscillate in heave, with natural frequency\n(approximately) according to the relationship f (Hertz) =\np\nk/m/2π. Here k is the effective\nspring constant, and m is the object mass. For the buoys, the spring constant (N ewtons/meter) is\nfound by taking the increment in buoyancy force divided by the increment in heave position. The\nbuoyancy force is of course the volume displaced by the buoy times the fluid density and gravity.\nWhat is the natural frequency of each of these two buoys? Given that many surface waves in the\nocean are between three and ten seconds in period, how do these buoys fundamentally differ in\ntheir response to waves?"

Consider a 1 meter long cylindrical buoy with a radius of 15 cm. For the buoy to be\nneutrally buoyant at a depth of 2000 m what must its mass be? Neutral buoyancy is when the\nbuoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the object. The buoyancy force (FB) is the\nweight of water displaced by the object (FB = ρSW · V · g). The density of seawater is 1025 kg/m3 .\nBy changing the volume of the buoy, its buoyancy can be changed. If the buoy is lengthened by\n0.5 cm, what is the buoyancy force on the buoy? Assuming that a drag force of Fd = 1.5729 is\nexerted on the moving buoy, how long will it take to reach the surface from 2000 m depth?\n(Remember that for F = m · a, F equals the sum of the forces acting on the object).\nThe density of fresh water is 1000 kg/m3 . What would be the buoyancy force on this buoy in fresh\nwater? What would happen to the buoy? Assuming the same mass and radius, how long must the\nbuoy be to be neutrally buoyant in fresh water?\n2.\nDeployment planning & data acquisition. An in situ chemical sensor has a storage capacity of 1\nmillion bits. The sensor must have a resolution of 0.1 ppm over a 0-100 ppm range. This means\neach measurement must be 10 bits long (10 bits in binary goes up to 1024 in base 10). Assume\neach measurement must also have an 32 bit time stamp. To deploy this sensor for a year, how\noften can measurements be recorded? If a calibration routine is performed once a day which\ngenerates 256 bits of data, how often can measurements be made over the course of the year? If\nyou could collect data once an hour, how long could you deploy the instrument (you still need a\ncalibration procedure every day)?\n3.\nRaman spectroscopy is a type of vibrational spectroscopy in which you interrogate a sample with\na monochromatic light source (a laser) and look at the backscattered radiation which is shifted in\nwavelength. The shift is due to the vibrational modes of the molecule and can be used to identify\nthe molecule. The intensity of the backscattered radiation (IR) is dependent on the laser intensity\n(IL), the concentration (C), the Raman scattering efficiency of the molecule (σ), and instrumental\nfactors (η): IR = IL·σ·η·C. We take the intensity to be the area under the Raman peak (A). If you\nhave a mixture of two molecules, their peak areas and concentrations are related by:\nThe signal-to-noise ration necessary for detection of a peak is S/N = 3. Assume the RMS noise is\n50, and the peak area is 1500 counts for a concentration of 50 mol/cm3. What is the lowest\nconcentration that can be detected? Consider a two-part mixture, where the peak areas are the\nsame, but C2 = 5·C1. If σ1 is 2.5, what is σ2? (You can assume that the instrument parameters do\nnot change - i.e., η1=η2)"

      "content": "12.097 Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\nLab 1:\nDETERMINATION OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN BY WINKLER TITRATION\n1. Background\n\nKnowledge of the dissolved oxygen (O2) concentration in seawater is often necessary in\nenvironmental and marine science. It may be used by physical oceanographers to study\nwater masses in the ocean. It provides the marine biologist with a means of measuring\nprimary production - particularly in laboratory cultures. For the marine chemist, it\nprovides a measure of the redox potential of the water column.\n\nThe concentration of dissolved oxygen can be readily, and accurately, measured by the\nmethod originally developed by Winkler in 1888 (Ber. Deutsch Chem. Gos., 21, 2843).\nDissolved oxygen can also be determined with precision using oxygen sensitive\nelectrodes; such electrodes require frequent standardization with waters containing\nknown concentrations of oxygen. They are particularly useful in polluted waters where\noxygen concentrations may be quite high. In addition, their sensitivity can be exploited\nin environments with rapidly-changing oxygen concentrations. However, electrodes are\nless reliable when oxygen concentrations are very low. For these reasons, the Winkler\ntitration is often employed for accurate determination of oxygen concentrations in\naqueous samples.\n2. Scope and field of application\nThis procedure describes a method for the determination of dissolved oxygen in\naqueous samples, expressed as mL O2 (L water) -1. The method is suitable for the\nassay of oceanic levels of oxygen in uncontaminated seawater and is based on the\nCarpenter (1965) modification of the traditional Winkler titration.\n3. Definition\nThe dissolved oxygen concentration of seawater is defined as the number of\nmilliliters of dioxygen gas (O2 ) per liter of seawater (mL L -1 ).\n4. Principle of Analysis\nThe chemical determination of oxygen concentrations in seawater is based on the\nmethod first proposed by Winkler (1888) and modified by Strickland and Parsons\n(1968). Oxygen in the water sample oxidizes iodide ion (I-) to iodine (I2)\nquantitatively. The amount of iodine generated is then determined by titration with a\nstandard thiosulfate (S2O3\n-2) solution. The endpoint is determined by using starch as a\nvisual indicator. The amount of oxygen can then be computed from the titer: one\nmole of O2 reacts with four moles of thiosulfate.\n\n12.097 Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\nAt the time of sampling, dissolved oxygen is fixed by the addition of Mn(II) under\nbasic conditions, resulting in a brown precipitate, manganic hydroxide (MnO(OH)2).\nPrior to analysis, the sample is acidified to pH 1.0-2.5. This causes the precipitated\nhydroxides to dissolve, liberating Mn(III) ions. Mn(III) ions oxidize previously added\niodide ions to iodine. Iodine forms a complex (I3\n-) with surplus iodide ions. Iodine\nand the complex exist in equilibrium; thus, I3\n- serves as a reservoir of I2. The iodine\nis then titrated with thiosulfate; iodine is reduced to iodide and the thiosulfate is\noxidized to tetrathionate. The stoichiometric equations for the reactions described\nabove are:\n(\n)2\nOH\nMn\nOH\nMn\n→\n+\n-\n+\n\n(\n)\n(\n)2\nOH\nMnO\nO\nH\nO\nOH\nMn\n→\n+\n+\n\noxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(III)\n(\n)\nO\nH\nI\nMn\nH\nI\nOH\nMn\n+\n+\n→\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\noxidation of I- to I2\n-\n-↔\n+\nI\nI\nI\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n+\n→\n+\nO\nS\nI\nO\nS\nI\n\noxidation of S2O3\n-2 to S4O6\n-2; reduction of I3\n- to I-\n\nThe thiosulfate solution is not stable and therefore must be standardized with a\nprimary standard, typically potassium iodate (KIO3). Standardization is based on the\nco-proportionation reaction of iodide with iodate, thereby forming iodine. As\ndescribed above, the iodine binds with excess iodide, and the complex is titrated with\nthiosulfate. One mole of iodate produces three moles iodine, which are consumed by\nsix moles of thiosulfate.\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+\n→\n+\n+\n→\n+\n+\nO\nS\nI\nO\nS\nI\nO\nH\nI\nH\nI\nIO\n\nA note to the student:\nThe entire method is presented below. It is important that you understand the\ncomplete method from sample collection to analysis. In addition, you might need/\nwant to repeat this measurement in the future. All reagents will be made before the\nlab period. Additionally, the sodium thiosulfate solution will be standardized for you.\nIf time allows, you may get a chance to do this. You will be responsible for\nmeasuring your own blank and samples. You are responsible for the procedures\ndescribed in section 9c and onward.\n\n12.097 Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\n5. Sampling apparatus\na. Sample flasks: Glass stoppered dissolved oxygen bottles (115 mL nominal\ncapacity - also called \"BOD bottles\"). 1 clean and dry bottle per sample, blanks\nand standard.\nb. Volumetric dispensers (or manual volumetric pipettes (disposable, glass)).\nc. Four dispensers capable of accurately dispensing 1 mL aliquots. These should be\nlabeled \"Reagent #1\", \"Reagent #2\" and \"Reagent #3\", and \"KIO3 Blank\".\ni. One dispenser capable of accurately dispensing a 10 mL aliquot. This\nshould be labeled \"KIO3 Standard\".\nii. One dispenser capable of accurately dispensing a 50 mL aliquot. This\nshould be labeled \"Sample\"\niii. Tygon(r) tubing: long enough to reach from spigot to the bottom of the\nsample bottle.\n6. Titration apparatus\na. Titration box: a three-sided box containing the titration apparatus. The inside\nwalls should be covered with white lab paper to aid in end point detection.\nb. Magnetic stirrer and stir bars.\nc. 10 mL reservoir-fill buret for thiosulfate titrations.\nd. Clean, dry 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks (one per titration - 125mL beakers can also\nbe used)\ne. Glass eye dropper bottle for starch indicator.\n7. Reagents\na. Reagent #1: Manganese (II) chloride (3M: reagent grade): Dissolve 600 g of\nMnCl2*4H2O in 600 mL distilled water. After complete dissolution, make the\nsolution up to a final volume of 1 liter with distilled water and then filtered into\nan amber plastic bottle for storage.\nb. Reagent #2: Sodium iodide (4M: reagent grade) and sodium hydroxide (8M:\nreagent grade): Dissolve 600g NaI in 600 ml of distilled water. If the color of\nsolution becomes yellowish brown, discard and repeat preparation with fresh\nreagent. While cooling the mixture, add 320g NaOH to the solution, and make up\nthe volume to 1 liter with distilled water. The solution is then filtered and stored\nin an amber glass bottle.\nc. Reagent #3: Sulfuric Acid (50% v/v): Slowly add 500 mL of reagent grade\nconcentrated H2SO4 to 500 mL distilled water. Cool the mixture during addition\nof acid.\n\n12.097 Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\nd. Starch indicator solution (manual titration only): Place 1.0g of soluble starch in a\n100mL beaker, and add a little distilled water to make a thick paste. Pour this\npaste into 1000 mL of boiling distilled water and stir for 1 minute. The indicator\nshould be stored in a refrigerator.\ne. Sodium Thiosulfate Stock solution (0.18 M: reagent grade): Dissolve 45 g\nNa2S2O3*5H2O and 2.5g sodium borate, Na2B4O7 (reagent grade) for a\npreservative, in 1 liter of distilled water. This solution is stored in a refrigerator\nand used to make the working thiosulfate solution. Some variation on the method\ncall for a 0.1N (Normal) solution, which can be purchased ready-made.\nf. Sodium Thiosulfate working solution (0.018 M: reagent grade): Bring 100 mL of\nthe sodium thiosulfate stock solution to 1000 mL with distilled water in a 1 liter\nvolumetric flask. This solution is stored in a refrigerator and used for titrations. If\na ready-made 0.1 N solution was used for the stock, a working solution of 0.01 N\nwill be fine.\ng. Potassium Iodate Standard (0.00167 M = 0.01 N: analytical grade): Dry the\nreagent in a desiccator under vacuum. Weigh out exactly 0.3567 g KIO3 and\nmake up to 1.0 liter with distilled water. It is important to note the temperature of\nthe solution so that a precise molarity can be calculated.\n8. Sampling\na. Collection of water, from the Niskin bottle or bucket sample, must be done soon\nafter the sample has been collected, preferably before any other samples have\nbeen drawn. This is necessary to minimize exchange of oxygen, which typically\nresults in contamination by atmospheric oxygen.\nb. Before each water sample is collected, open the spigot on the Niskin bottle\nwithout opening the bleeder valve. If water flows out of the spigot then air must\nbe entering the sampling bottle through a leak and the seawater within the bottle\nhas probably been contaminated with water from shallower depths. Record this\nonto the data sheet.\nc. If no water flows out of the spigot, attach a rubber tube to the spigot and stick the\ntube all the way into the sample bottle. With the spigot open, slowly open the\nbleeder valve to allow water to stream out of the spigot. If the sample is being\ncollected from a bucket, carefully immerse the BOD bottle into the water so that\nwater gently fills the bottle without creating bubbles. Rinse the sample bottle\ntwice with the sample water.\nd. After rinsing, fill the bottle slowly - always trying to minimize the amount of air\nbubbles introduced into the water. Adjust the bleeder valve to control the flow.\nAllow the water to overflow the neck of the bottle. Place the stopper into the\nbottle. Record all sample information on data sheet, and make sure BOD bottle is\nlabeled accordingly.\ne. Immediately after obtaining the water sample, the following reagents are\nintroduced into the filled BOD bottles by submerging the tip of a pipette or\nautomatic dispenser well into the sample: 1 mL of manganous chloride (Reagent\n\n12.097 Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\n#1), followed by 1 mL of sodium iodide-sodium hydroxide solution (Reagent\n#2).\n9. Titration Procedures\na. First, the precise concentration of thiosulfate in the titrating solution must be\ndetermined. Next, a \"blank\" is analyzed. Impurities in the reagents may\nparticipate in the oxidation-reduction reactions involved in the dissolved oxygen\nanalysis and thus must be accounted for. Once the standard titer and blank have\nbeen determined, the samples can be titrated with thiosulfate delivered via the\nburet; the endpoint is determined visually using the starch indicator solution.\nBelow, the procedures for standardization, blank determination, and sample\nanalysis are described. As mentioned above, the sodium thiosulfate solution will\nbe standardized for you. You will make your own blank and sample\ndeterminations. If time allows, you may try performing the standardization\nyourself.\nb. Standardization: Label one clean, empty BOD bottle \"KIO3 Standard\"; add\napproximately 15 mL of Milli-Q water and a stir bar.\ni. Carefully add 10 mL of standard potassium iodate (0.00167 M = 0.01N)\nfrom an \"A\" grade pipette or equivalent. Swirl to mix. Immediately add 1\nmL of the 50% sulfuric acid solution (Reagent #3). Rinse down sides of\nflask, swirling to mix, thus ensuring an acidic solution before the\naddition of reagents.\nii. Add 1 mL of sodium iodide-sodium hydroxide reagent, swirl, then add 1\nmL of manganese chloride reagent. Mix thoroughly after each addition.\nOnce solution has been mixed, fill to the neck with deionized water.\niii. From the \"Standard\" bottle, fill the 50 mL volumetric pipet with KIO3\nsolution.\niv. Empty the first 50 mL of solution into a waste container as a rinse.\nv. Re-fill the 50 mL pipet with KIO3 solution and empty into a clean 125-\nmL Erlenmeyer flask. Add a magnetic stir bar.\nvi. Check the 10 mL buret to ensure that it is full of thiosulfate working\nsolution (0.01N). Place the erlenmeyer flask under the buret and turn on\nthe magnetic stirrer. Keep the speed of the stir bar moderate - do not\ncreate a vortex in the solution.\nvii. Slowly add thiosulfate to the solution until the solution turns a pale\nyellow color. Stop titrating.\nviii. Add three drops starch solution to the flask. Continue to titrate by\nadding thiosulfate drop by drop just until the solution becomes colorless.\nix. Record the volume of thiosulfate added. Repeat steps 6 through 9 until\nyou have three readings within 0.05 mL of each other.\n\n12.097 Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\nc. Blank determination:\ni. Place approximately 15 mL Milli-Q water in a BOD bottle with a stir\nbar. Add 1 mL of the potassium iodate standard, mix thoroughly, then\nadd 1 mL 50% sulfuric acid, again mixing the solution thoroughly.\nii. Before beginning the titration, add the following reagents: 1 mL sodium\niodide-sodium hydroxide reagent (#1), rinse, mix, then add 1 mL\nmanganese chloride reagent (#2). Fill the BOD bottle to just below the\nneck with Milli-Q water. Titrate to the endpoint as described for the\nsample analysis procedure (below).\niii. Pipet 1 mL of the standard solution into the same flask and again titrate\nto the end point.\niv. The difference between the first and second titration is the reagent blank.\nEither positive or negative blanks are possible.\nd. Sample analysis:\ni. Identify the sample you are working on by the number on the bottle and\nthe corresponding data sheet; copy this information into your notebook.\nii. Immediately prior to analysis, add 1 ml 50% H2SO4 (Reagent #3) below\nthe water line in the sample bottle.\niii. Cover and invert the sample bottle several times to mix the solution.

You should have at least three values for each sample.\nComputing the average value is straightforward, but how do you estimate the\nuncertainty (i.e. how well you know that value)? For this exercise, you are concerned\nonly with the precision of your measurements. Later, we will ask you to compare the\nmeasurement precision with the uncertainty generated from measurements made on\nreplicate samples (i.e., separate samples collected from the same Niskin bottle).\nTo calculate the uncertainty of your average value, you will first calculate the\nstandard deviation (σ) of your measurements of the volume of thiosulfate needed (R),\nusing the following formula:\n\n12.097 Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\nts\nmeasuremen\nyour\n\nof\n\naverage\n\nthe\n\nt\nmeasuremen\n\nindividual\n\nthe\nts\nmeasuremen\n\nof\nnumber\n\nthe\nN\n:\nWhere\n)\n(\n=\n=\n=\n-\n-\n=\n∑\nx\nx\nx\nx\nN\nσ\n\nCalculation of the standard deviation can be performed as follows (you can do this in\nMicrosoft Excel):\nAfter calculating the average value of your three measurements, subtract it from each\nof the three measurements. Then, square each of these and add them together.\nMultiply this value by 1/(N-1) (in this case N=3), and take the square root. You can\ncheck your long hand calculations by using Excel's STDEV function. Please show\nall your work. You only need to show your work for one long-hand calculation of\nσ. All other calculations can be done in Microsoft Excel using the STDEV\nfunction.\nNow, estimate the uncertainty in the determination of the mean (sometimes called the\nstandard error). Divide the standard deviation by the square root of the number of\nmeasurements.\nNow calculate the dissolved oxygen concentration for each sample, using the average\nthiosulfate volume for your sample, R, and your blank, Rblk. Propagate the error of all\nthree R values to estimate the error on your O2 concentration. (A sample calculation\nis provided below for your convenience.)\nSample calculation:\nA student titrated three aliquots of a water sample with thiosulfate. The three\nvolumes of thiosulfate were 7.17mL, 7.36mL and 7.22mL. The average value is\n7.25mL and the standard deviation is 0.10mL. The standard error is the standard\ndeviation divided by the square root of the number of volume measurements (3) and\nis equal to 0.06mL.\nThe blank value measured by this student was 0.52mL. The error on this\nmeasurement is the error inherent in the buret (0.05mL) because there was only one\nmeasurement.\nThe dissolved oxygen concentration can be calculated by substituting the values into\nthe equation given above:\n\n12.097 Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\n(\n)\n(\n) (\n)\nL\nmLO\nmL\nmL\nmL\nmL\nequiv\nmLO\nL\nequiv\nmL\nmL\nmL\nO\n/\n.0\n*\n.0\n.0\n.0\n.3\n*\n.0\n*\n*\n.0\n.0\n.0\n.7\n-\n-\n±\n-\n±\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n±\n-\n±\n=\n\nI know you all know how to do the basic arithmetic in this equation, but you may not\nknow how to propagate errors.

      "content": "12.097 - Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\nLab 2: NITRATE ANALYSIS\n\nIntroduction:\nToday we're going to measure nitrate concentrations in your Boston Harbor / Mass Bay\nsamples. The two most common forms of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic systems are\nammonium (NH4\n+) and nitrate (NO3\n-). Nitrate is the most oxidized form of nitrogen in\naquatic systems and it cannot be used by organisms unless it is first reduced to\nammonium. This reduction often occurs within the organism itself and the nitrogen is\nassimilated into organic nitrogen or excreted as ammonium. In riverine and coastal\nsystems, nitrate is derived from terrestrial debris and agricultural fertilizers. In seawater,\nnitrate is usually higher than ammonium, but is still often low due to biological uptake by\nphytoplankton.\n\nMethod:\nNitrate cannot be detected in the water column in its natural state, but instead needs to be\nreduced to nitrite (NO2\n-) and then chemically altered to a photo-active complex. There\nare a number of methods for nitrate analysis, ranging from manual methods such as the\nmethod we will perform today to automatic methods such as a nitrate electrode. The\nchoice of method depends on the anticipated nitrate concentrations and the funds\navailable for analysis. Nitrate electrodes are commonly used for high concentrations,\nwhile manual methods are more sensitive and thus used for samples with low nitrate.\n\nChemistry: First, the nitrate (NO3\n-) in our samples will be quantitatively reduced over Cd\ngranules (treated with CuSO4) and converted to nitrite (NO2\n-). The nitrite will then be\nconverted to an azo compound (N=N) with sulfanilamide and then complexed to N-(1-\nnaphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride. The resulting azo dye is a brilliant reddish-\npurple color and its concentration is measured spectrophotometrically. In this method,\nyou assume that all nitrate is converted quantitatively to the azo-complex and that the\nconcentration of complex is directly proportional to the original nitrate concentration.\n\nSample acquisition:\nWater samples must be acquired and filtered through a 0.2μm filter (or a 0.45μm filter) to\nremove all biological organisms. Samples must then be frozen at -4oC as soon as\npossible for storage until analysis.\n\nSample analysis:\nReduction reagent: You will be given Cd granules that need to be treated with 2%\nCuSO4. Put approximately 1-2 cm of Cd granules into the 250mL beaker provided. Add\nCuSO4 solution and swirl until you see some red precipitates forming. Put the CuSO4\nsolution into the waste container and repeat. Rinse the granules once with Milli-Q water;\nplace the waste rinse into the waste container. Add enough Milli-Q water to your beaker\nto cover the Cd/Cu granules. Once you have activated your granules, please be careful\nnot to let these granules dry out. Always keep a layer of water above the granules in your\nbeaker and your column.\n\nPage 1/4\n\n12.097 - Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\nReagents:\n(A)\nColor reagent: 800mL water + 100mL 85% phosphoric acid + 10g\nsulfanilamide; when sulfanilamide is dissolved completely, add 1g N-(1-\nnaphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride; bring to 1L with Milli-Q water -\nstable for 1 month in amber bottle in refrigerator\n(B)\nStock NH4Cl-EDTA solution: 39g NH4Cl + 5.1g Na2EDTA in 900mL Milli-Q\nwater; adjust pH to 8.5 with concentrated NH4OH; bring to 1L with Milli-Q\nwater - stable indefinitely\n(C)\nDilute NH4Cl-EDTA solution: 40mL Reagent B to 200mL with Milli-Q water\n- stable indefinitely\n\nStock nitrate solution:\n\n1mM KNO3\n\n1. You must make 4 standard solutions with the following concentrations: 10μM,\n20μM, 40μM, and 60μM. Using the formula, M1V1 = M2V2, calculate the\nvolume of stock solution that you will need to make 100mL of each standard. Fill\nin the third line of the table below before coming to class:\nStandard NH4\n+ solution\nTarget concentration (μM)\nVolume stock needed (mL)\n\nActual volume stock added (mL)\n\nStandard concentration (μM)\n\n2. Using the pipets provided, add the appropriate volume of stock solution to a\n100mL volumetric flask for each standard. Bring to volume with Milli-Q water.\n3. Using the beakers provided, arrange and label enough beakers for each of your\nstandards, a blank (Milli-Q water) and three replicates of each of the water\nsamples at your station.\n4. Make the dilute NH4-EDTA solution (Reagent C) in the 500mL volumetric flask.\nYou will need to make a number of batches of this reagent over the course of the\nexperiment.\n5. Make the Cd-reduction column at your station.\na. First, put a plug of glass wool in the base of the column.\nb. Add the Cd-Cu granules to the column. Use your squirt bottles and\nspatulas to coax the granules into the column. Be sure to keep water\nabove the Cd-Cu granules at all times so that the column doesn't dry out.\nDrain excess water into a waste beaker whenever needed.\nc. Make 200mL of a \"wash\" solution - 150mL Reagent C + 40mL Milli-Q\nwater + 10mL stock NO3\n-. Add to the column. Drain until the water level\nis approximately 1 cm above the granules.\nd. Wash the column a second time but with 200mL dilute NH4-EDTA\nsolution (Reagent C).\n\nPage 2/4\n\n12.097 - Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\ne. During the second rinse, adjust the flow rate of your column so that you\nare collecting between 10 and 15 mL / min. Ideally, it should take you 8\nmin to collect 100mL (the flow rate here is about 13mL/min).\n\nNOTE #1: The reduction of NO3\n- to NO2\n- is time-sensitive. After you reduce each\nsample, quickly add the color reagent so that you capture as much nitrite as you can. You\nwill reduce all your samples, blanks and standards. Do this in the following order: blank,\nsamples, standards.\n\n6. For the blank:\na. Using a 100mL graduated cylinder, combine 25 mL Milli-Q water and 75\nmL Reagent C. Reserve this graduated cylinder for use with your\nstandards in step 7.\nb. Transfer into the appropriately marked beaker.\nc. Pour the mixture onto the column. You should have ample room for the\nentire sample within the bulb on top.\nd. Drain your sample through the column. Discard the first 30mL. Collect\nthe remaining sample in the original beaker.\ne. Pour 50mL of sample into a mixing cylinder.\nf. Add 2mL color reagent (A). Mix well.\ng. Let the complex develop for 10min before spectrophotometric analysis.\n\nNOTE #2: To maximize your efficiency, you should add the next sample for NO3\n-\nanalysis as soon as the previous sample has drained through the column. Add the next\nsample when the level of the previous sample reaches 0.5 cm above the Cd-Cu granules.\nDo not worry about mixing the new sample with the previous one - this is why you\ndiscard the first 30mL.\n\n7. For your samples:\na. Using the other 100mL graduated cylinder, combine 25mL sample and\n75mL Reagent C. You will use the same graduated cylinder for all your\nsamples, so rinse with a little sample when you start a new one. You only\nhave approx. 15mL of sample to use as a rinse so please be thrifty!\nb. Transfer the sample mixture into the appropriately marked beaker.\nc. Reduce the NO3\n- in the same manner as the blank (steps 5c and onward).\n8. For your standards:\na. Using the 100mL graduated cylinder, combine 25mL of your standard\nwith 75mL Reagent C.\nb. Transfer to the appropriate beaker.\nc. Reduce the NO3\n- in the same manner as the blank (steps 5c and onward).\n\nNOTE #3: We may not have enough mixing cylinders for each standard and sample\nreplicate. You will have enough to do a large fraction of your samples. However, when\nyou run out, rinse the cylinder three times with Milli-Q water and shake to remove any\nexcess water. You can then use the mixing cylinder for your next sample(s).\n\nPage 3/4\n\n12.097 - Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\n9. Wait 10 min and transfer your sample to the tubes provided for the\nspectrophotometer. We will be analyzing our samples in Karen Casciotti's lab\n(basement of McLean building). Each sample will be loaded into the instrument\nby an auto-sampler so label your tubes in a way that you know what is contained\nin each tube.\n\nData analysis:\n1. Using the spectrophotometer, you measured the absorbance of light (at 543nm) by\nthe complex in your samples.\n2. Using Microsoft Excel, plot concentration in μM versus absorbance. This means\nconcentration is your x-value and absorbance is your y-value. Be sure to include\nyour blank value as a zero concentration. Hand in a copy of your standard curve.\nInclude the regression line and R^2 value.\n3. Find the average and standard error of the triplicate absorbance values for each\nsample.\n4. For each sample, find the concentration of nitrate using the inverse of the\nregression line you determined. Propagate the error on your sample, slope and\nintercept to estimate the error on your final concentration.\n5. Identify aspects of the procedure (from collection to measurement) that may have\nintroduced some error into your final results. Suggest ways to minimize these\nerrors.\n\nReference\nStrickland, J.D.H., and Parsons, T.R. (1968). Determination of reactive phosphorus. In: A\nPractical Handbook of Seawater Analysis.

Background\n\nIn this experiment, we will analyze Hudson River water samples for their phosphate\ncontent. Phosphate-containing compounds are used in detergent formulation as water\nsofteners. Thus, detergents can be the primary contributor to phosphate loads in rivers\nand lakes. Phosphate is not toxic to animals or plants. In fact, it is a plant nutrient,\nwhich stimulates the growth of aquatic weeds and algae. This may cause lakes and\nrivers to become clogged and overrun with plants (eutrophication). In the oceans,\nphosphate is limiting over geological time scales since the only source is weathering\nof continental rocks.\n\n2. Scope and field of application\n\nThis procedure describes a method for the determination of reactive phosphorus in\nwater samples, suitable for the assay of concentrations of 0.01- 2.5 μM. This method\nis a modification of Strickland and Parsons (1968).\n\n3. Definition\n\nThe reactive phosphate concentration is given in units of μM.\n\n4. Principle of Analysis\n\nThe determination of reactive phosphorus in seawater is based on the method\nproposed by Strickland and Parsons (1968). The seawater sample is allowed to react\nwith a composite reagent containing ammonium molybdate, ascorbic acid and\npotassium antimonyl-tartrate. In the ascorbic acid-molybdate method orthophosphate\nreacts with molybdate to form phosphomolybdic acid. Phosphomolybdic acid is\nreduced by ascorbic acid to form a blue complex:\nPhosphate + Molybdate →Phosphomolybdic Acid\nPhosphopmolybdic Acid + Ascorbic Acid → Reduced Phosphomolybdate complex\nThe intensity of the blue color at 885 nm is proportional to the phosphate\nconcentration in the solution. It has been demonstrated that in dilute, acidic solutions\nwith an excess of the molybdate species present, Beer's Law is obeyed with respect to\nphosphate.\n\nBeer's Law is frequently written as: A = ε l C\nwhere: A = the absorbance; ε = the molar absorptivity; l = the path length in cm (in\nour case, this is 1 cm) and C = the concentration of absorbing species in moles per\nliter. If Beer's Law is obeyed, a linear plot of A vs. C should result. If one prepares a\nBeer's Law plot with standard solutions, an unknown can be determined by\n\n12.097 - Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\n\ncomparison to the standard curve.

The spigot is opened and water from the Niskin bottle tube is directed into\na clean Filter cup, which is attached to the hand vacuum pump. The\nfunnel stem and rubber stopper are placed snugly into the mouth of the\nsample bottle and vacuum is applied. Three sets of samples are collected\nfrom the water that passes through the filter. If the sample is being\ncollected from a bucket, carefully pour the water into the Filter-cup. Rinse\nthe sample bottle twice with a small amount of filtered sample water.\n\nc. After rinsing, fill the bottle to just below the shoulder. Care must be taken\nto avoid overfilling of samples to be frozen. These bottles are transferred\nto a freezer (-20°C) and kept frozen until analysis. Record all sample\ninformation on data sheet, and make sure sample bottle is labeled\naccordingly. Water samples to be tested for phosphate (PO4) concentration\nare not stable at room temperature and must be frozen if not analyzed\nimmediately.\n\n8. Phosphate Analysis\n\na. Prepare the phosphate standard solutions\n\ni. All four standards and the reagent blank should be run each time a\nnew batch of mixed reagent is made.\n\n12.097 - Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\n\nii. Using the volumetric pipet provided, transfer 2 mL of KH2PO4\nprimary standard solution (0.01M) into a clean 100 mL volumetric\nflask. Bring to 100 mL with Q water.\n\niii. From this working solution (2.0 x 10-4M) prepare the following\ndilutions. Use the adjustable pipettor or volumetric pipets to\ndeliver the standard to the labeled volumetric flasks, then bring to\n100 mL with Q water:\n\n4.0 μM:\n2 mL of the working solution; bring to 100 mL with Milli-Q water.\n\n2.0 μM:\n1 mL of the working solution; bring to 100 mL with Milli-Q water.\n\n1.0 μM:\n500 μL of the working solution; bring to 100 mL with Milli-Q water.\n\n0.5 μM:\n250 μL of the working solution; bring to 100 mL with Milli-Q water.\n\nb. Prepare the unknown samples\n\ni. Remove the samples to be measured from the freezer well enough\nin advance of analysis so that the sample water may be brought to\nroom temperature. (Note: this will be done for you).\n\nii. Using the beakers provided, arrange and label enough beakers for\neach of your standards, a blank (Milli-Q water) and three replicates\nof each of the water samples at your station.\n\niii. Using the 25mL graduated pipet, deliver 50 mL Milli-Q water into\nthe beaker labeled as your blank.\n\niv. Next, deliver 50 mL of sample to each pre labeled beaker. Rinse\nthe pipet between samples (not replicates) with 25mL of the new\nsample.\n\nv. Finally, deliver 50 mL of each standard to the proper pre-labeled\nbeaker.\n1. Do this from lowest to highest concentration.\n2. Rinse the pipet between each standard first with 25 mL of\ndeionized water.\n3. Then rinse with 25mL of the next standard. Discard this as\nwaste.\n4. Deliver 50 mL of each standard into its beaker.\n\nc. Prepare the reagents\n\n12.097 - Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\n\ni. The majority of the reagents used in this lab will be made for you.\nThe mixed reagent, however, must be made just prior to\nmeasurement.\n\nii. Using the clean graduated cylinders provided, add the specified\nvolumes of the reagents to the 300mL Erlenmeyer flask in the\nfollowing order.\n\nReagent\nVolume\nAmmonium molybdate\n50 mL\nSulfuric acid\n125 mL\nAscorbic acid\n50 mL\nPotassium antimonyl-tartrate\n25 mL\nTotal Volume\n250 mL\n\nd. Treat the samples\n\ni. Using the 5 mL graduated pipet, add 5.0 mL of mixed reagent to\neach beaker or flask (including all standards, the blank, and the\nunknowns). Swirl each sample gently after adding the mixed\nreagent.\n\nii. The samples must be allowed to develop color for at least 20\nminutes, and should be run within 2 hours, though the loss over the\nfirst 24 hours is relatively minor.\n\ne. Measure samples on the spectrophotometer (885nm):\n\n9. Determining PO4 concentration from absorbance\n\na. Using Microsoft Excel, plot the concentration of your standards in μM\nversus absorbance. This means concentration is your x-value and\nabsorbance is your y-value. Be sure to include your blank value as a zero\nconcentration.\n\nb. Find the regression line for your standard curve.\n\ni. On the chart itself (Go to \"Add Trendline\" under Chart; choose a\nlinear fit with the equation and R2-value displayed on the chart)\ndisplay the trendline and hand in a copy with your data.\n\nii. We want you to use the worksheet alternative to calculate the\nerrors on your slope and intercept. In the worksheet, use the\nfunction LINEST. The syntax of this function is =LINEST(y-\nrange, x-range, TRUE, TRUE). Hit Ctrl-Shift-Enter after typing\nthis function because it is an \"array\" function in Excel. You will\n\n12.097 - Environmental Chemistry of Boston Harbor - IAP 2006\n\nget back a set of numbers 2 columns by 3 or 4 rows and the cells\ncorrespond to the following parameters:\n\nSlope value\nIntercept value\nError on slope\nError on intercept\nR2\nStandard error on y values\n\nc. Find the average and standard error of the triplicate absorbance values for\neach sample.\n\nd. For each sample, find the concentration of phosphate using the inverse of\nthe regression line you determined. Propagate the error on your sample,\nslope and intercept to estimate the error on your final concentration.\n\ne. Find the average of your three concentration values for each sample.\n\nf. Identify aspects of the procedure (from collection to measurement) that\nmay have introduced some error into your final results. Suggest ways to\nminimize these errors.\n\n10.

The wire is like a pipe.\n- Resistor R: V = IR,\n-\nDissipation: Resistive Power P = I2R = V2/R\n-\nAnalogy: viscous losses in pipe flow\n- Capacitor C: i = C dV/dt\n- Analogy: a hydraulic accumulator\n- Inductor H: V = L di/dt\n- Analogy: inertia of water in a pipe\nOhms, Ω\nfarads, f\nhenries, h\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 12.097\nThe Op-Amp\nTwo inputs (called inverting and non-inverting); one\noutput.\nThe output voltage is a HUGE gain multiplied by the\ndifference between the inputs.\nHoriwitz's & Hill's golden rules:\na.\nThe op-amp enforces (in proper use)\nVinv = Vnon-inv\nb. No current flows into the device at either input\nVinv\nVnon-inv\nV+ (supply)\nV- (supply)\nVout\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 12.097\nExample Op-Amp: Adding a Voltage Bias\nR2\n(V-Vinv)/R1 = (Vinv-Vout)/R2 and\nVinv = Vnon-inv Æ\nVR2 = Vinv(R1+R2) - VoutR1 Æ\nVout = Vnon-inv (R1 + R2)/R1 - VR2/R1\nLetting R1 = R2, then\nVout = 2Vnon-inv - V\nThe circuit inverts the input V and\nadds on 2Vnon-inv\nIF Vnon_inv is ground, then\nVout is -V. This is just an inverting\namplifier.\nVinv\nVnon-inv\nV+\nV-\nR1\nV\nVout\nVoltage bias useful for bringing\nsignal levels into the range of\nsensors.\nThe op-amp is discussed in detail\nby Horowitz and Hill, covering\nintegrators, filters, etc.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 12.097\nSerial Communications\n- How to transmit digital information fast and reliably over\na few wires?\n- Examples: RS-232, RS-485, etc. refer to pins & wires\n- A minimal case of RS-232 (DB25 connector is full case):\n- Asynchronous operation; both sides agree on BAUD rate\n- Three wires: send (TX), receive (RX), ground\n- No error checking!

Also, two-state signal resists noise corruption.\n-\nSensors: PWM period is naturally related to rotation or update rate:\nHall effect, anemometers, incremental encoders, tachometers, etc.\n-\nCommunication: PWM duty cycle is continuously variable Æ like an D/A\nand an A/D.\n-\nActuation: At very high frequencies, physical systems filter out all but\nthe mean; i.e.,\nVeffective = duty_cycle * Vpeak\nHigh frequency\nswitching is the\ndominant mode\nfor powering\nlarge motors!\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 12.097\nField Effect Transistor (FET)\n- Like a \"valve\", that is very easy to open or close. When\nFET is open, resistance is low (milli-Ohms); when FET is\nclosed, resistance is high (mega-Ohms or higher)\n- Typically three connections:\n- Gate: the signal; low current\n- Source: power in\n- Drain: power out\n- N- and P-type junctions are common, and involve the\npolarity of the device.

Example:\nvehicle speed >> the possible value given thrust level\nand prior tests.\n- Second defense: set data to NaN (or equivalent), so\nit won't be used in calculations.\n- Third defense: try to fill in.\nExample:\nif abs(x(k) - x(k-1)) > MX,\nx(k) = x(k-1) ;\nend;\nÆ Limited usefulness!"

(See readings.)\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nForms in marine waters\n- Three forms in aqueous solution:\n- Free hydrated ions (e.g., Fe+2, Cu+2)\n- Inorganic complexes (e.g., Fe(OH)-)\n- Organic complexes; bound by organic ligands\n- [M]free << [M-L] or [M]Tot\n- Some metals adsorb to particles and are\n\"scavenged\" from aqueous solution during\ntransit to deep ocean\n- Redox chemistry is important for some metals,\nespecially if solubility changes with oxidation\nstate\n\nVertical profiles - Fe, Mn\n1. For each element, left plot is total concentration and right plot is \"free\" ion\nconcentration. Note the significantly larger concentrations for Mn than Fe.\n2. Fe has significant fraction bound by organic ligands (note [L]T > [Fe]T; Mn\ndoes not. (no known ligands have been found).\n3. Both show increased surface concentrations - due to aeolian input (dust)\n4. Both show subsurface maxima associated with O2 minimum\n5. In low O2 zones, Mn may have dynamic redox cycle: Mn(II) ↔Mn(IV)\nImages removed due to copyright considerations.\nPlease see: Morel et al., 2003.
