  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nSyllabus Archive\n\nThe following syllabi come from a variety of different terms. They illustrate the evolution of this course over time, and are intended to provide alternate views into the instruction of this course.\n\nSpring 2010, Jeffrey Ravel (\nPDF\n)\n\nSpring 2008, Jeffrey Ravel (\nPDF\n)\n\nSpring 2006, Jeffrey Ravel (\nPDF\n)\n\nSpring 2005, Jeffrey Ravel (\nPDF\n)\n\nDescription\n\nThis class is a selective survey of Latin American history from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present. Issues studied include Latin America in the global economy, relations between Latin America and the US, dictatorships and democracies in the twentieth century, African and Indigenous cultures, feminism and gender, cultural politics, revolution in Mexico, Cuba, and Central America, and Latin American identity.\n\nRequirements\n\nClass attendance is mandatory. I will take attendance each week; students who miss more than one class session will fail the subject. Students must come prepared to discuss each week's assignments. Students will complete ten homework assignments, due as indicated on the syllabus. Class presentations, in groups of two and three students, will be due in class on Lecture 9. Instructions for the homework assignments and class presentations will be distributed later in the term. There will also be a map quiz and a comprehensive final exam. Assignments will be weighted as follows:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPOINTS\n\nNine Homework Assignments\n\n10 Points Each (90 Points Total)\n\nMap Quiz\n\n10 Points\n\nClass Presentation\n\n30 Points\n\nFinal Exam\n\n70 Points\n\nTotal\n\n200 Points\n\nStatement on Cheating and Plagiarism\n\nThe web now hosts many sites which offer college-level papers of varying quality on a variety of topics. I am well acquainted with these sites, and with others that offer detection services to professors.\nBuying a paper and submitting it as your own work is cheating. Copying sections from someone else's print or online work into your own without an acknowledgement is plagiarism.\nMIT has strict policies against both activities that I will enforce. For the appropriate MIT definitions and policies, visit the following websites. If you are uncertain about what constitutes cheating or plagiarism, please contact me\nbefore\nsubmitting the work in question.\n\nMIT Online Writing Communication Center\n\nAvoiding Plagiarism",

      "content": "21H.802 Editing Suggestions\nPage 1 of 1\nEDITING SUGGESTIONS\nThe writing process includes rigorous editing practices. Below are some points to keep in mind as\nyou re-read and edit your papers before turning them in. You may also wish to look at the brief guide\nto writing by W. Strunk and E.B. White called The Elements of Style.\nSome Rules\n1. Avoid passive constructions. \"The chair was seen by me,\" is not as forceful as \"I saw the\nchair.\"\n2. Use the past tense when describing historical individuals and events, not the present tense.\n3. Avoid unnecessary words. After you have drafted your essay, set it aside for a day or two.\nThen reread it, eliminating every word that is redundant or does not add to your meaning.\nPrime candidates for deletion are adverbs such as \"very,\" \"quite,\" \"extremely.\"\n4. Never use the phrase \"I feel that....\" This lends a subjective air to your argument that tends to\ndiscredit you. Write \"I think that....\"\n5. Learn how to use the spell-checker on your computer program.\nSix Questions to Ask Before Turning in Your Paper\n1. Is the title of my essay informative?\n2. Do I state my thesis point soon enough, perhaps even in the first sentence, and keep it in view\nthroughout the paper? Is the opening paragraph interesting, and by its end, have I focused on\nthe topic?\n3. Is my organization clear? Does each point lead into the next, without irrelevances and without\nanticlimaxes?\n4. Is each paragraph unified by a topic sentence or topic idea?\n5. Are sentences concise, clear and emphatic? Are needless words and inflated language\neliminated?\n6. Is the final paragraph conclusive without being repetitive?"

      "content": "21H.802\nSpring 2005\nORAL REPORT GUIDELINES\nOral reports are due in class on April 4th and April 11th. You and a classmate\nmust choose a topic by March 14th, the last class meeting before Spring Break. Feel free\nto propose topics to me before then; I can help you narrow your interest to a manageable\nsize. If you do not have a topic and a co-presenter by then, I will place you in teams and\nassign topics before you leave for Spring Break. At our class meeting on March 28, we\nwill assign report times for the next two class sessions. I have listed potential topics at\nthe bottom of these guidelines, but you are also free to pursue your own interests. The\ntopic should be an issue of contemporary relevance in one or more Latin American\ncountries, and it should have a readily traceable history that goes back at least to the start\nof the 1990s. Following are guidelines for the report:\n1) You must consult at least four sources for your report, and at least two of the sources\nmust be print materials. (i.e., your research should be conducted both online and in the\nlibrary.)\n2) The report should be approximately 20 minutes long, leaving us 10 minutes for\nquestions after each report.\n3) Each group should prepare an outline of the presentation, with a bibliography at the\nend. Distribute a copy to each class member and to me before the presentation. You may\nalso wish to prepare a powerpoint presentation or a web site to go with your presentation.\nI will post your outline, and any other digital materials you prepare, on the stellar web\nsite after the presentations for the entire class to consult.\n4) When you deliver the report, speak loudly and clearly. You may consult your outline,\nbut do not read a text you have prepared ahead of time. All presenters should speak at\nsome point during the presentation, but it is up to you to divide the material between you\nfor presentation.\n5) The report should be divided into two sections: a summary of the issue's history, and a\nstatement about the current status and future prospects for your topic. (For example, if\nyou choose to report on the Fox presidency in Mexico, you will want to explain the last\ntwo elections before that of 2000 that brought the PAN to power, then evaluate Fox's first\nyear in office, and his prospects for the remainder of his presidency. I will provide some\ninitial bibliography and research guidance. Skidmore and Smith will provide updates, but\nyou may also wish to consult two important sites for Latin American research: the Latin\nAmerican Network Information Center at the University of Texas (LANIC) and Internet\nResources for Latin America. You may also search the sites of newspapers such as the\nNew York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and major Latin American newspapers (if you\n\nread Spanish or Portuguese). The MIT Libraries website also has links to useful\nresources.\nGrading: The grade for the oral report will be based primarily on its content, with some\nattention paid to the style of the delivery. (i.e., did the presenters speak clearly, was the\noutline helpful, etc.) I will grade the group presentation jointly, rather than individually,\nmeaning that the members of each group will receive the same grade based on the overall\nquality of the report, rather than differing grades based on individual efforts.\nPossible Topics:\n- Liberation Theology in Latin America since 1970\n- Protestant Evangelism in Latin America since 1970\n- African Syncretist Religious movements (Santeria, Candomble, Umbanda, etc.)\n- Any of the countries of Central America in the 1980s and 1990s\n- Venezuelan Politics in the era of Hugo Chavez\n- Challenges to the Story of Rigoberta Menchu\n- The Politics of Soccer in Latin America\n- Carnival and Tourism in Brazil\n- The Woes of Haiti\n- The Shining Path Guerilla Movement in Peru\n- The pepinadores of Mexico City\n- Drug production and trafficking in a single Latin American country\n- Maquiladoras and the Global Economy\n- Ecology and State Policy in any Latin American Country\n- Mexican politics since 1968"

In\nwhat ways does it differ from this model?\n2) Thanks to the country's success in exporting meat and grains, Argentina was clearly\nan economic success story at the beginning of the twentieth century. Was it also a\npolitical and social success at this time?\n3) Was tango merely entertainment in Argentina at the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury? Or did it have more significant political and cultural meanings? If so, what\nwere those meanings?"
