  "course_description": "This is a course in how corporations make use of the insights and tools of risk management. Most courses on derivatives, futures and options, and financial engineering are taught from the viewpoint of investment bankers and traders in the securities. This course is taught from the point of view of the manufacturing corporation, the utility, the software firm—any potential end-user of derivatives, but not the dealer. Most related courses focus on the extensive taxonomy of instruments and the complex models developed to price them, and on ways to exploit mispricing. While this course will make use of some of these pricing models, the focus is on how corporations use the insights and models to improve their operations, to increase the value of their real assets, or to create the financial flexibility necessary to implement their core strategy.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nCourse Objective\n\nThere are many types of risk management going on in different parts of a company at the same time. The most familiar loci of risk management are trading operations and the treasury office. But many other parts of the firm are involved in risk management. The marketing department designs types of contracts for customers that share risk. Business unit managers evaluate projects with different risk characteristics, and decide on ways to alter projects so as to minimize risk without sacrificing return. The tax, legal, and accounting departments are concerned with risk, with hedging, and with the corporate governance issues. At the highest level of the company key questions about the firm's strategy and its ability to fund its operations must be answered with an eye on the risks of each alternative and strategic decisions that can secure the greatest value for shareholders.\n\nEach of these different risk management activities focuses on different aspects of risk management. The problem before a commodity trader is not the same problem that is before the business unit manager and not the same problem that is before the CFO. The problems facing each actor within the firm demand a focus on different risk related issues.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nFrom the corporate finance side, this course builds on material developed in 15.434, Advanced Corporate Finance. From the risk management side, this course builds on the tools and techniques developed in 15.437, Options and Futures Markets.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThe course will be taught with a mixture of lectures presenting specific tools and outline of corporate problems and case discussions in which students attempt to apply the tools and concepts. Class participation is obviously critical. Outside of class students will have the opportunity to focus on key analytic tools and problem sets. The TA will set up 5 recitation sessions to offer students a chance to discuss the 4 problem sets. Students should read the relevant materials before the class covering those topics.\n\nGrading\n\nThe course is offered only on a Pass/Fail basis. A passing grade is earned by (1) attendance, (2) general class participation, especially in the case analysis, and (3) obvious effort and accomplishment in mastering the basic tools, including the problem sets. Engagement is the key. The learning is a collective process accomplished with involvement on the part of all.\n\nAdditional References\n\nGood textbooks to utilize as backup references are:\n\nBrealey, Richard, Stewart Myers, and Franklin Allen.\nPrinciples of Corporate Finance\n. 9th ed.

A relevant reference is Parsons and Mello,\nLecture Notes on Advanced Corporate Financial Risk Management, Chapter 9.2: Risk-\nNeutral Pricing.\nBinomial Tree\n(1) Recall the binomial model developed in homework one, with T = 2 years and N=2,\ni.e. using a two-step tree, one step for each year. The expected rate of appreciation in\nthe price is 10%, the annual volatility is 28%, the risk-free rate to 5%, and the copper\nspot price starts at $2.65/pound. Now assume that the appropriate discount rate is 10%.\na) What are the risk-neutral probabilities? Is the risk-neutral probability of an up\nmove higher or lower than the actual probability, and why?\nb) What is the expected price of copper in two years? What is the expected price\nusing the risk-neutral probabilities?\nc) What is the value of a contract which delivers one unit of copper in two years?\nDo this once by discounting the future value of the copper delivery using the risk-\nneutral methodology - i.e., using risk neutral probabilities and the risk-neutral\ndiscount rate. Do this a second time discounting the future value of the copper\ndelivery using a risk-adjusted discount rate - i.e., using the actual probabilities\nand some discount rate greater than the risk-neutral discount rate. What risk-\nadjusted discount rate gives you the same answer?\nd) What should be the price of a forward contract delivering one unit of copper 2\nyears from now?\ne) Now find the value of an option to buy copper two years from now at a strike\nprice of $2.50/pound. First, use the risk-neutral approach - risk-neutral\nprobabilities and a risk-free discount rate. Second, use the risk-adjusted\ndiscounting approach, using the risk-adjusted discount rate derived earlier.\nCompare the results. Third, suggest an alternative risk-adjusted rate.\n(2) Change the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to 15%. Adjust your spreadsheet\nand redo all of the calculations above.\n(3) Apply the 10% discount rate to the 10-step binomial tree.\n\na) What is the current forward price for contracts delivering copper in each of the\ndifferent years, t=1,2,3,...10?

Graph the term structure of the call prices.\nd) What is the value of a contract that takes delivery of 1 unit of copper in every\nyear, with the price collared at $3 and $7? With a collar price, the price is equal\nto the market price unless the market price is below $3, in which case the\ncontract price is $3, or the market price is above $7, in which case the contract\nprice is $7.\n(4) Apply the 15% discount rate to the 10-step binomial tree.\na) What is the forward price for contracts delivering copper in each of the different\nyears, t=1,2,3,...10?

The first case is a risk and valuation\ncase. The second case is a bidding and negotiation case. We will focus on the\nfirst and ignore the second. Assume for purposes of our discussion that the\ncompany is outright buying the property. As anywhere, it may pay royalties and\ntaxes on what it produces, but there is no negotiation on these rates. The task is\nto decide what the company should be willing to pay today to purchase the mine.\n1. Treat this first as a traditional capital budgeting problem. Set up and execute a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation of the mine. What is the DCF value? Be prepared\nto explain the valuation to the class...which line items do you use, what are the\nkey calculations or adjustments and assumptions you need to make, what is the\nresult.\n2. Create a timeline detailing the key decisions down the road that will be shaped\nby new information after the initial purchase of the property. For each decision,\noutline how the decision will be made--i.e., what is the underlying factor that will\nimpact a decision, what are the tradeoffs and what is the rough 'formula'\ndetermining the right action.\n3. Lay out a range of scenarios for the underlying risk factors shaping the\nrealized project value. How does the realized project value change as you vary\nthe underlying risk factors?\n4. How do the underlying risk factors evolve and change through time? Describe\nthe dynamics in casual terminology.\n5. How does the project's risk evolve and change over time? Is it more or less\nrisky before or after the decision to develop the property?\n6. How do the results of questions 2-5 feedback to your evaluation of the original\nDCF? Is the original valuation probably about right, probably too low or too high?\n7. How would you use the 'real options' approach to value the property? Start by\ntrying to represent this project valuation in the framework of 'real options' - i.e.\nconstructing the 'option' analogy for this valuation problem: what is the underlying\nasset, what is the strike price, what is the time to maturity and so on. Use the\nBrealey/Myers/Allen textbook chapter on Real Options as a point of reference."

The right-hand-side of the balance sheet should not be\nautonomous, and certainly should not shape the left-hand-side of\nthe balance sheet.\nModigliani-Miller Theorem of Hedging\nFirst order, direct effect of hedging is zero gain to shareholder value\nRisks are bought and sold at fair market value\n3⁄4 Firms that are long commodity price risk, capture the risk premium\nassociated with it\n3⁄4 Firms that hedge the commodity price risk by selling forward, give away\nthe risk premium\n3⁄4 Hedging doesn't change shareholder value\n\nSpot vs. Forward Sales\nSelling into the spot market is risky, but the expected future spot\nprice offers a return for the risk\nSelling forward offloads that risk, but the forward or futures price is\non average lower, representing the risk discount\nFrom a present value perspective, the two are equivalent.\nAn Operations Research Problem That Isn't\nAn electric utility is trying to decide how best to source its coal.\nHow much should it buy under long-term contracts - say 10 years -\nand how much to buy under medium-term contracts - say 5 years -\nand how much to leave for purchase under short-term contracts or in\nthe spot market?\nThe company has forecasts for long-term contract prices, medium-\nterm contract prices and spot prices.\nRun an optimization model to find the right mix of contracts: trading\noff lower prices against risk.\n\nThe Real Financing Problem\nFriction between the company and outside capital sources is the\nissue;\nthere are incentive problems and information problems;\nthese problems distort the company's operations and its investment\nprogram, hurting shareholder value.\nKey Strategic Tasks\nYour Task: Organize the company's contact with external capital\nmarkets to minimize these frictions and problems.\n3⁄4 minimize the need to access external capital markets,\n3⁄4 optimize the timing for access to external capital markets,\n3⁄4 efficiently redesign the financing to minimize the frictions.\nMinimizing the frictions and problems with the external capital\nmarket enables the company to exploit all of its opportunities and to\ncapture the fullest value from its competitive advantages.\n\nWhat's $1 Worth?\nWhat is the Market Value of a Dollar of Corporate\nCash?\nCourse packet: JACF, Pinkowitz & Williamson.\nModel: to estimate the marginal contribution of a company's cash\nholdings to its value, we expressed the value of the firm as a\nfunction of several key variables, including holdings of liquid assets:\n3⁄4 V is the market value of the firm\n3⁄4 E is earnings before extraordinary items plus interest, deterred tax\ncredits and investment tax credits\n3⁄4 L is liquid asset holdings (cash + marketable securities)\n3⁄4 NA is net assets (total assets - liquid assets)\n3⁄4 RD is research and development expense\n3⁄4 I is interest expense\n3⁄4 D is common dividends paid.\n\nWhat is the Market Value of a Dollar of Corporate\nCash?

best to default\nIf the mine is open, and the price falls below $0.59, spending $2\nmillion to close the mine is better for the combined interest of debt\nand equity; but it mostly serves the interest of the debt, while the\nmoney is put up by the equity owners; the equity owners prefer to\nkeep operating and paying out the low margin as a dividend\nIt is NOT in the interest of equity owners to maximize the value of\nthe mine; it is in their interest to maximize the value of the equity\n\nValuation of the Mine with Debt\nSolution which maximizes the value of the equity:\n3⁄4 opening price = $0.79/pound\n3⁄4 closing price = $0.54/pound\n3⁄4 abandonment price = $0.40/pound\n3⁄4 value of the mine, currently open = $22.85 million\n3⁄4 value of the debt = $4.67\n3⁄4 value of the equity = $18.18\nDeadweight cost of the debt: $1.61 million\n3⁄4 6.6% of the mine value when optimally managed\n3⁄4 33% of the debt value\nSource of the deadweight cost is the sub-optimal operation of the\nmine.\nSource of the Deadweight Cost of Debt\nSub-optimal operating and investment decisions\nEarly abandonment when the mine still has valuable reserves\nDelayed closing in the face of low copper prices\n3⁄4 negative NPV decision\nEarly opening in the face of rising copper prices\n\nThe Incentive Problem\nEquity risk-return profile looks very different than the \"mine\" risk-\nreturn profile\nDebt skims a fixed payout, regardless of how the price of copper\nmoves\nEquity gets a very levered payout; riskier with respect to the price of\ncopper\nEquity makes decisions to maximize the value of this levered\npayout, not the original mine payout\nSolution\nreshape the payoffs to debt and equity\ntry to tailor the equity payoff to match the mine payoff as closely as\npossible; make it reflect price risk to the same degree; i.e., don't\nlever the equity with price risk so much\ngive the debt some of the price risk\ndenominate the promised debt payments in pounds of copper\nset the annual debt service equal to 10 million pounds of copper @\n60% of the spot price of copper\n\nThe Effect of Commodity Linked Debt\nWhen the price falls below $0.40/pound, some of the loss in value is\nborn by the creditors, and the danger of further losses is also shared\nby the creditors, so the equity won't abandon the mine until it has\ndropped a good bit further, i.e., $0.32\nAlso improves the opening and closing decisions.\nValuation of the Mine with Commodity Debt\nSolution which maximizes the value of the equity:\n3⁄4 opening price = $0.80/pound\n3⁄4 closing price = $0.55/pound\n3⁄4 abandonment price = $0.32/pound\n3⁄4 value of the mine, currently open = $23.27 million\n3⁄4 value of the debt = $4.87\n3⁄4 value of the equity = $18.40\nDeadweight cost of the debt: $1.19 million\n3⁄4 4.9% of the mine value when optimally managed\n3⁄4 smaller by $0.42 million;

Parsons\nOverview\nDefining and Measuring Exposure\nHow Volatile are Companies?\nDecomposing Risk to Factors\nModeling Exposure\nTotal Exposure\nEconomic Exposure\nCash Flow Exposure vs. Value Exposure\n\nDefining Exposure\nWhen we talk about exposure, we are talking about risk. Variables\nthat cause the value of an asset to change are called risk factors. If\nchanges in the factor cause changes in the asset value, then the\nasset value is exposed to the factor.\nThe asset that is exposed could be, for example...\n3⁄4 the total market value of a company,\n3⁄4 the market value of a division or a project,\n3⁄4 the value of a supply contract, or\n3⁄4 the value of a security such as a stock or option or futures contract.\nOne set of risk factors are called market risks and include,\n3⁄4 exchange rates,\n3⁄4 general market movements, i.e., stock market indexes,\n3⁄4 the rate of inflation,\n3⁄4 interest rates, or\n3⁄4 the price of oil or other widely traded and quoted commodities.\nDefining Exposure (cont.)\nMany key risk factors don't have a widely cited or even readily\nquotable index.\n3⁄4 The demand for your company's product, product X, can wax and wane\nand is an important exposure.\n3⁄4 Technological progress may advantage or disadvantage your product or\nservices.\nAnd many key risk factors have to do with your own operations.\n3⁄4 Is your company able to implement an important new plant design?\n3⁄4 Can you train your staff to operate in a global environment?\n3⁄4 Is your R&D pipeline going to succeed in generating new, valuable\ndrugs.\n\nAn Aside\nThese are risks that you don't want to hedge. Meaning you don't\nwant to just sell them away. If you do that, you might as well quit the\nbusiness. If you think this is a business that you should be in, then\nthese are the risks you claim to be able to master. You will profit by\ntaking on these risks and winning at them. This is what you invest\nyour capital in. In order to make a profit, this has to be the gamble\nyou take on.\nExposure Measures\nThere are many ways to measure exposure or risk.\n3⁄4 A common measure of risk is volatility, i.e., the standard deviation of the\nvalue. We can speak interchangeably about volatility and variance, since\nvariance is the square of the volatility. Therefore, exposure to factor X is\nthe volatility in value due to movements in factor X.\n3⁄4 There are other measures of risk. A recently popularized measure is the\nvalue at risk or VAR. The VAR is the expected loss at a given confidence\nlevel, for example, the 5% confidence level.\n3⁄4 Why are there multiple measures of risk? Because risk is a complicated\nthing!\n3⁄4 Only in special cases, such as the normal distribution, can a random\nvariable be summarized by just 2 parameters - expected return and\nvariance. Many key risk factors are not well described by the normal\ndistribution. For example, some have fat tails. And many asset\nexposures are asymmetric, creating a non-linear relationship between\nthe factor and the asset value so that the distribution of the asset value\nis highly skewed. Therefore, variance is not a sufficient measure of risk.\n\nExposure Measures (cont.)\nA proper definition of exposure requires that we specify the horizon\nover which risk is measured.\n3⁄4 Is the exposure measured over a day, a week, a year?\n3⁄4 The size of the exposure may be sensitive to the horizon. For example,\nwithin a short horizon it may be impossible to close out a position.\nHowever, over a long horizon this is possible, and this puts a floor on the\ndownside. The importance of horizon is even greater for analyzing risk at\nnon-financial corporations than at financial corporations.\nExposures can also be conditioned on key variables.\n3⁄4 Market depth varies through time and can affect the volatility of a stock\nor other investment.\n3⁄4 General GARCH properties. Be careful about observing a simple\naverage across all market conditions and then projecting that forward at\na given time.\n3 Examples of Exposure Calculations\nExposure of a receivable to a movement in the exchange rate.\nExposure of a call option to changes in the stock price.\nExposure of a company's stock price to environmental legislation.\n\nExample #1: Exposure of a receivable to a\nmovement in the exchange rate\nAn Italian aircraft parts manufacturer has made a sale to a US\ncompany. It has delivered a parts shipment invoiced at $3.20 million.\nThe cost of goods sold is €1.95 million. Payment is due in 3 months.\nThe €/$ rate is 0.6842.\nMeasured in Euros, the receipt on the transaction are risky. A 1%\nchange in the exchange rate implies a €20,000 change in the Euro\ndenominated value of the receivable.\nThe 3-month volatility in the Euro/Dollar exchange rate is 8.9%, i.e.,\n±8.9% is a one-standard deviation movement in the exchange rate\nover a 3-month horizon.\nExample #1: Exposure of a receivable to a\nmovement in the exchange rate (cont.)\nStandard\nDeviations\nPercentile\nExchange Rate\nReceivable in\nEuros\nGain or Loss\n+2\n98%\n0.8047\n2.58\n0.39\n+1.65\n95%\n.7831\n2.51\n0.32\n+1\n84%\n.7439\n2.38\n0.19\n0 (Mean)\n50%\n.6831\n2.19\n-1\n16%\n.6223\n1.99\n-0.19\n-1.65\n5%\n.5831\n1.87\n-0.32\n-2\n2%\n.5615\n1.80\n-0.39\n\nExample #2: Exposure of a call option to changes\nin the stock price\n\nUsing the Black-Scholes formula for a\nstock with a current price of $100, a\nstrike price of $100, a time to maturity\nof 2 years, a volatility of 22%, and\nassuming the risk free rate is 5%:\nC($100) = $17.1.\n\nThere is significant upside and limited\ndownside. It is a very non-linear\nexposure.\n\nAt the current price of $100, the option\ndelta is 0.68331. Meaning that a $1\nchange in the stock price yields an\napproximately $0.68 change in the call\nprice.\n\nBut clearly for a large move in the\nstock price up, for example, $100, the\nchange in the call price will be more\nthan $68: C($200)-C($100) = $109.6\n$17.1 = $92.5.\n\nAnd for a large move down, the\nchange in the call price will be much\nless. C($0)-C($100)= -$17.1.\nStock Price\nCall Price\nExample #2: Exposure of a call option to changes\nin the stock price\n\nThe volatility of the option can also be\ncalculated from the volatility of the\nstock:\n\nAt S=$100, so that Δ=0.68331 and\nC=$17.13, we have Ω=3.99.\nTherefore, the call volatility is 88%.\n\nThis is just the local volatility. At a\nhigher stock price the volatility is\nsmaller, at a lower stock price, it is\ngreater.\n\nThis is also local in the sense that it\nshows changes in the call value today\nas a function of changing the stock\nprice today...not the changes in the\ncall value at various horizons in the\nfuture.\n\nWhat is the VAR for the call at a 5%\nconfidence interval?\nC\nS\nstock\nstock\ncall\nΔ\n=\nΩ\n=\nσ\nσ\nσ\nStock Price\nCall Price\n\nExample #3: Exposure of a company's stock\nprice to environmental legislation\nA company's stock price is exposed to many risk factors. Corporate\n10Ks traditionally list the major exposures or risk factors, providing a\nqualitative, but not quantitative statement.\nSome examples from Peabody Energy Co's 2006 10K are...\n3⁄4\nIf a substantial portion of our long-term coal supply agreements terminate, our\nrevenues and operating profits could suffer if we were unable to find alternate\nbuyers willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms to those in our contracts.\n3⁄4\nIf transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our\ncustomers, our ability to sell coal could suffer.\n3⁄4\nOur mining operations are extensively regulated, which imposes significant costs\non us, and future regulations and developments could increase those costs or\nlimit our ability to produce coal. ...Legislation was introduced in Congress in 2006\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Such or similar federal\nlegislative action could be taken in 2007 or later years. Further developments in\nconnection with legislation, regulations or other limits on greenhouse emissions,\nboth in the United States and in other countries where we sell coal, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nStock analysts and other researches attempt to quantify these\nexposures in various ways...\nExample #3: Exposure of a company's stock\nprice to environmental legislation (cont.)\nRobert Repetto of Stratus Consulting produced this analysis of the\nKyoto Protocol adoption on the stock prices of various oil cos:\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nHugh Wynne, a Senior Research Analyst at Bernstein Research,\nhas a very insightful breakdown of how passage of the Lieberman-\nWarner or like carbon legislation would impact different electric\nutilities in the US. Some gain and some lose. Why?\n\nExample #3: Exposure of a company's stock\nprice to environmental legislation (cont.)\nThe adequacy of corporate disclosures with respect to climate\nlegislation exposures has been a pressure point of late, both for\nregulators and for active shareholder groups.\nTotal Exposures of Exchange Traded\nCorporations\n\nA study by Andersen et al. (2000) estimated the volatility of the 30\nindividual stocks in the DJIA (not the portfolio) during 1993-1998...\n3⁄4 median annual volatility of 28%,\n3⁄4 high of 42% for Walmart, and low of 22% for United Technologies.\n3⁄4 As a comparison, the annual standard deviation for a broad market\nportfolio was approximately 11% in the 1990s. (figure from Campbell et\nal. 2000)\nProbably varies cross sectionally - across countries, industries.\n\nTotal Exposures of Exchange Traded\nCorporations (cont.)\nAnnual volatility of the market as a whole shows no consistent trend.\nThere have been periods of markedly higher and periods of\nmarkedly lower volatility.\nTotal Exposures of Exchange Traded\nCorporations (cont.)\nVolatility can be measured in different ways: for example, using\nrecent historical returns, or using implied volatilities. These are 2\ntechniques ostensibly for measuring the same thing.\nCourtesy Elseviver, Inc., http://www.siencedirect.com.

Lettau, B. G. Markiel, and\nY. Xu. \"Have Individual Stocks Become More Volatile? An Empirical Investigation of Idiosyncratic Risk.\" Journal\nof Finance 56 (2001): 1-43.\n\nTotal Exposures of Exchange Traded\nCorporations (cont.)\nVolatility is measured under an assumption of a given model.\nClassic assumption is normality - or lognormality - and an\nunchanging distribution through time. This yields the standard\nformula for estimating the standard deviation.\n3⁄4 GARCH models.\n3⁄4 Mixing of normals yields fat tails.\n3⁄4 How relevant are these to the corporate context?\nDecomposing Stock Volatility Into Risk Factors\n\nThe Market Risk Factor - CAPM's Beta\n3⁄4 The Market Index Model decomposes a company's stock price\nmovements into 2 parts.\n3⁄4 One part is the movements associated with general stock market\nmovements. This is the systematic component.\n3⁄4 The second part is the residual or unaccounted for movements. This is\nthe non-systematic component.\nRit = αi + βim Rmt +εit\nThe regression R2 tells us the portion of the volatility that is\naccounted for by general market movements.\n\nDecomposing Stock Volatility Into Risk Factors\n(cont.)\n-10\nMarket Index Monthly Excess Return (%)\nCompany Stock Monthly Excess Return (%)\nR-squared = 0.575\nAdapted from Bodie, Kane & Marcus, Investments.\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n-6\n-4\n-2\nBeta = 1.16\nDecomposing Stock Volatility Into Risk Factors\n(cont.)\nMaybe there is more than just one factor? This is the rationale for\nmodels such as the APT. Other macroeconomic factors that have\nbeen considered are...\n3⁄4 the long- short-term yield spread\n3⁄4 real GNP\n3⁄4 inflation\nEach of these macroeconomic factors will account for some portion\nof the volatility of a given stock, and we can determine these\nfractions.\nOther models include Fama-French 3-factor model, and more.\n\nDecomposing Stock Volatility Into Risk Factors\n(cont.)\nThe Industry Index Model is a popular tool for dividing the volatility of\na firm's return into 3 components...\n3⁄4 the market component,\n3⁄4 the industry component, and\n3⁄4 the firm specific component.\nIt is exactly like the CAPM's market model, except with an additional\nregressor, the performance of an index of comparable companies:\nit\nR\ncomp t\ni comp\nmt\nim\ni\nR\nR\nβ\nβ\nα\n+\n+\n=\n,\n,\nit\nε\n+\nWe can attribute a portion of the stock's movements to each of the\nthree components.\nExample #1: Performance Evaluation at Ralston\nPurina\nCampbell and Wasley, 1999, Stock-based incentive contracts and\nmanagerial performance: the case of Ralston Purina Company,\nJournal of Financial Economics 51, 195-217.\nIn 1986 Ralston Purina adopted a new incentive contract for its\nmanagement, giving them $49.1 million in stock within 10 years if\nthe stock price closed above $100 for 10 consecutive days. At the\ntime of adoption, the price was $63.375.\nBy February 1991 this hurdle had been reached.\nCampbell and Wasley calculate an industry index model of returns\nduring this period.\n\nExample #1: Performance Evaluation at Ralston\nPurina (cont.)\nExample #1: Performance Evaluation at Ralston\nPurina (cont.)\nFrom 1986 to 1991, the entire industry had been outperforming the\nmarket.

Their conclusion is that the incentive contract was badly\ndesigned.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nExample #2: Identifying Exposures of Latin\nAmerican Firms\n\nSergio Pernice, Mariano Fernandez and Maria A.

It can\nbe a commodity price or the exchange rate.\nFor example, to measure a gold mining company's exposure to gold\nprices as well as to the market index, you expand the usual CAPM\nregression to include the returns to gold as one of the independent\nvariables:\nit\nmt\nim\ngt\nig\ni\nit\nR\nR\nR\nε\nβ\nβ\nα\n+\n+\n+\n=\nIt is important to get a complete measure of returns.

Journal of\nFinance 53(3), 1015-1052.\nTypical \"gold beta\" is around 2\n3⁄4 a 1% change in the price of gold produces a 2% change in the stock\nprice\n3⁄4 Raw distribution is very wide: 5th percentile has a gold beta of -0.44 and\nthe 95th percentile a gold beta of 5.68.

It is appropriate for certain kinds of risk\nrelationships... continuous, linear. There are other techniques that\nare appropriate to other risk relationships...\n3⁄4 Probit models for estimating the likelihood of some discrete event.\nAnd there are techniques for extracting information more efficiently\nunder certain circumstances. What if you need information about the\ntail, and you are afraid that your distribution assumptions are not\ncorrect. Then the classic regression will lead you astray.\nWe are not probing this any more deeply here and now. But the\npoint is that this is where more sophisticated statistical analysis\nwould fit in.\nThr\ne\ne g\nr\naph\ns\nsh\no\nwing ti\nme seri\nes and\ncross-s\nectiona\nl distr\nibution\nof Dim\nson-adj\nusted g\nold bet\nas.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.

It involves measuring the\nsensitivity of the model to variations in an input, i.e., as would produce a\ntornado diagram.\nTransaction exposure calculation is the classic and simplest\nexample.\nThis exercise is also known as a pro-forma exposure calculation.\nModeling Exposure (cont.)\nExample: Measuring the exposure of bitumin supply cost to\n3⁄4 elements of the discount rate,\n3⁄4 natural gas prices\n3⁄4 other, non-fuel, operating costs, such as labor costs, and\n3⁄4 capital costs.\nLacombe, Romain, and John Parsons, 2007, Technologies, Markets and Challenges for Development of the\nCanadian Oil Sands Industry, MIT-CEEPR Working Paper 07-006.

In this case companies\nmay take managerial actions to\nchange the production rate or\notherwise reduce the exposure.\nThese actions are often overlooked\nin simple models of exposure. The\ndata, however, appears to reflect\nthese reduced exposures.\nFinal Exposure\nExposures are sometimes reported as a sensitivity measure like\nBeta--a 1% change in the underlying risk factor will cause, on\naverage, an X% change in the value of the asset.\nThis is not a complete answer, however. If the underlying risk factors\nitself is not very volatile, then the final exposure will be small, even\nfor a high Beta. If the underlying risk factor is extremely volatile, then\na small Beta can be misleading.\nThe sensitivity measure must be combined with information about\nhow volatile is the underlying risk factor. This will give the total\nvolatility of the asset value that is likely to be due to the factor.\nGr\nap\nh\nre\nl\na\nt\ni\nn\ng\n\na\nn\nal\nytically predicted betas with empirically observed betas.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare. Adapted from Tufano, Peter. \"The Determinants of Stock Price Exposure: Financial Engineering and\nthe Gold Mining Industry.\" Journal of Finance 53, no. 3 (1998): 1015-1052.\n\nMultiple Factors\nThe previous examples have all looked at the exposure to single\nfactors one at a time.\nWhen there are multiple factors, and these factors often move\ntogether, it is important to take into account the correlation between\nthe factors.\n3⁄4 For example, suppose a US company sells its goods in a variety of other\ncountries... the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico.\n3⁄4 It will have some receivables denominated in each currency.\n3⁄4 It's exposure to movements in any single exchange rate will be small,\nsimply because only a fraction of its receivables are denominated in that\ncurrency.\n3⁄4 It doesn't make sense to simply add up all of the exchange rate\nexposures.\n3⁄4 Its total exposure to exchange rate risk may be larger or smaller than the\nsimple addition tells you, depending upon whether the various exchange\nrates generally move together or separately, i.e., are correlated or\nuncorrelated. If they move separately, then diversification reduces the\nexposure.\nEconomic Exposure\nMany distinct parameters within a model should not be treated as\nseparate risk factors. For modeling and spreadsheet purposes, we\ncan input these as separate factors. But in the real world they may\nbe linked.\nThis is especially true of exchange rates and currency denominated\nselling prices or input prices. The very movement of an exchange\nrate may change the foreign currency denominated price at which\nyou can sell the commodity in the foreign country.\n3⁄4 The 2005-2008 run-up in oil prices was very expensive for companies\naround the world. But because the €/$ exchange rate increased as well\nduring that time, the € cost to European companies was softened. How\nmuch of the run-up in the $ denominated oil price is actually just a\nreflection of the fall in the dollar?\nSee the case of Western Mining - a reading in the case packet.\n\nCash Flow Exposure\nExposure is often defined in terms of a variable's impact on the\nvalue of an asset or the value of a company and its stock.\nExposure can be defined in terms of any parameter that may be\naffected by the underlying risky variable.\nA popular exposure to calculate is the impact on cash flow. For\nexample, what will be the impact of a change in the exchange rate\non next quarter's cash flow.\n3⁄4 or the cumulative cash flow over the next year.\nThe firm's value is the discounted present value of all future cash\nflows. So properly measured, a firm's cash flow exposures add up to\nthe firm's value exposure.\n3⁄4 Or, they would in a rational market. Shiller ( ) has argued that stock\nprices are too volatile compared to the volatility of dividends and\nultimately the cash flows of the firm.\nWhy Cash Flow Exposure Matters\nWhy cash flow volatility may matter. More on this in later lectures.\nBut a brief allusion now...There are several possible reasons.\nFirst, the comptroller needs to manage the firm's cash situation so\nas to minimize transaction costs and so as to minimize the pool of\nlow return, liquid cash equivalents needed. Knowing the potential\nvolatility of short-run cash needs is essential to this task.\nSecond, the long-run financial value of the firm can also be critically\nimpacted by short-run cash flow fluctuations...\n3⁄4 Suppose a firm is long a commodity - as an oil producing firm would be.\n3⁄4 And suppose the firm hedges its revenue stream with a financial\ninstrument such as an oil futures contract. The hedge appears to be\nperfect in the sense that the value of the futures contract is perfectly\nnegatively correlated with the value of the anticipated oil revenues.\n3⁄4 But the futures contract has very different cash flow structure. Gains or\nlosses on the futures contract must be settled up immediately, while\nanticipated gains or losses on the future oil sales are only realized as\nproduction occurs and the sales are made.\n\nWhy Cash Flow Exposure Matters (cont.)\n3⁄4 There may be a cash flow mismatch even where there appears to be a\nperfect value hedge. If the value of the anticipated sales is rising, then\nthe futures must be losing money and the company is shelling out cash\nnow, but banking on a larger future revenue stream.\n3⁄4 But how large of a cash shortfall can the firm cope with?\n3⁄4 Are the short-run losses self-financing? Can you borrow to cover the\ncash drain from the futures? You would appear to have the collateral to\nborrow, since the future anticipated revenue stream has gone up by as\nmuch as the cash drain.\n3⁄4 The answer is, no, the short-run losses on the perfect hedge are not self-\nfinancing.\n3⁄4 The hedge is only perfect if we focus narrowly on the revenue exposure.\nBut the company's value is affected by multiple risks. These other risks\ninterfere with the self-financing property of the apparently perfect\nrevenue hedge. And the effect is significant.\n3⁄4 Mello and Parsons, 2000, Hedging and Liquidity, RFS\n3⁄4 The sad tale of Metallgesellschaft. Intermediate cash flows can matter.\nTotal Cash Flow Exposures of Exchange Traded\nCorporations\nHere is a year-ahead cash flow distribution for 3 companies:\nThese have actually been constructed from comparables.\n3⁄4 Coca-Cola's distribution represents the sample distribution of cash flow\nshocks for approximately 1,000 companies like Coca-Cola over the\nyears 1991-1995.\n3⁄4 The other two distributions are the sample distributions for 50 companies\nlike Dell and another 50 companies like Cygnus.\nGraph of cash-flow distributions for three companies.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.

Used with permission.\nFrom Lecture Notes on Advanced Corporate Financial\nRisk Management. Used with permission.\n\nThe Risk-Premium\nThe risk-adjusted discount rate equals the risk-free rate plus a risk-\npremium:\nra = rf + λ\n\nWhere does this risk-premium come from?\nHow general is this risk-premium? If I have a risk-premium for oil\nprojects, can I apply it to all oil projects?\nThe risk-neutral methodology is one incarnation of the certainty-\nequivalent method, where we drill down beyond the risk-premium, λ,\nand then implement the certainty-equivalent calculations in a\nspecific way.\nState Prices\n\nThe General Idea\n\nStart with a project that has cash flows tied to an underlying risk factor, S.\nSuppose we can successfully value that project by discounting the cash\nflows in the usual manner using a risk-premium, λ.\nUnfortunately, we cannot use the same risk-premium, λ, to value all other\nprojects with cash flows tied to S! As the structure of the dependency on S\nchanges, the risk-premium has to change. But how?\nWe need to dig deeper. It turns out that we are ignoring some information\nthat we already have.\nThe risk structure of S - is it a random walk with a given drift and standard\ndeviation, or is it mean reverting, or something else - is the information that\nwe are ignoring. We can combine information about this risk structure\ntogether with the knowledge of the risk-premium, λ, for any single project to\nrecover the extra information that allows us to value all other projects with a\ndependence on S.\nWhat is the extra information? It is a complete vector of state-contingent\nprices for risk, φ. With this vector in hand, we can easily value all projects\ndependent on S.\nThere is no contradiction between risk-adjusted discounting using a risk-\npremium, λ, and risk-neutral pricing using state prices. They are tied\ntogether and, used correctly, do the same thing. But risk-neutral pricing is\nthe more convenient and robust route for handling many different types of\nprojects with different contingencies and changing risk profiles.\nThe Starting Point\nThe binomial branching shown is for an underlying risk factor S.\nThe risk factor starts in t=0 at the value S0, and branches in t=1\nto either SU or SD. This figure shows the branching of S, but not\nthose values. Instead, we overlay onto the branching diagram\nthe characteristics of a project with cash flows contingent on S.\nAt t=1 we show those contingent cash flows. At t=0 we show\nthe project value.\nFrom Lecture Notes on Advanced Corporate Financial\nRisk Management. Used with permission.\n\nThe Starting Point (cont.)\nAssuming rf = 4%, the fact that VP = $10 implies ra = 7% so\nthat λ = 3%.\nThe Complication: How Do We Handle Other\nProjects Also Contingent on S?\nFigures from Lecture Notes on Advanced Corporate\nFinancial Risk Management. Used with permission.\n\nApplying the Same Risk-premium is Wrong\nIt is tempting to apply the same risk-adjusted discount rate or risk-\npremium to the expected cash flows for each of these derivative\nprojects. But this would be incorrect:\nE[CF ]e-ra = (CFU ×πU ) e-ra = (CFU ×πU ) e-λP e\n-rf = VU\nE[CF ]e-ra = (CFD ×π D ) e-ra = (CFD ×π D ) e-λP e\n-rf = VD\nHow do we know this?\nRevalue the Project Using \"Forward State Prices\"\nRewrite the valuation of the project. But instead of discounting the\nwhole expected cash flow by the risk-premium, λ, discount the two\nseparate contingent cash flows, CFU and CFD, by two different\ndiscount factors, φU and φD:\nVP = (CFU ×πU ×φU + CFD ×π D ×φD ) e\n-rf\nIf this were a single equation, there would be no sense in trying to\nseparate the two cash flows and applying two different discount\nfactors. But, in fact, we can combine that one equation together with\nthe equation for valuing a risk-free cash flow:\nB = ($1×πU ×φU + $1×π D ×φD ) e\n-rf\nThis gives us two equations in two unknowns, so we can solve for\nthe two different discount factors, φU and φD.\n\nThe Forward State Prices or State Contingent\nDiscount Factors\nSolving these two equations gives us:\nφU = ⎜⎜\n⎛V e\nrf -CFD ⎟⎟\n⎞ 1 = 0.866\n⎝ CFU - CFD ⎠πU\nφD = 1-\nπ\n-\nU\nπU\nφU = 1.134\nNote that the discount factor being applied to \"up\" cash flows is less\nthan 1, while the discount factor being applied to \"down\" cash flows\nis greater than 1.\nCash in the \"down\" state is like insurance, and we are willing to pay\na premium for it!

It cannot be used to value any project with\ncash flows contingent on S. It only makes sense for projects with a\nsimilar weighting of \"up\" and \"down\" cash flows.\nBut we can use the project risk-premium, λP, together with\nknowledge about the risk structure of S, to derive the forward state\nprices.\n\nThe Risk-Neutral Distribution\nIndeterminacy\nIn the previous section on state prices, all of our illustrations\nassumed a known probability for the \"up\" branching and the \"down\"\nbranching.\nWe then backed out the forward state prices, and then valued the\nderivatives.\nWhat if we had assumed a different pair of probabilities for the \"up\"\nbranching and the \"down\" branching?\n3⁄4 The forward state prices would have changed.\n3⁄4 But the derivative values would NOT have changed!\nWhy?\n3⁄4 Because everywhere in the valuation formulas we employ the product of\nthe forward state prices and the probability. This is also true in the\nequations with which we derive the forward state prices.\n3⁄4 When we change the probability, we change the forward state prices, but\nthe product of the probability and the state prices stays the same.\n3⁄4 Therefore all valuations remain the same.\n\nIllustration: Start with the Original Problem\nIllustration: Revise it by substituting new\nprobabilities\nchange\nTables from Lecture Notes on Advanced Corporate\nFinancial Risk Management.

Instead of trying to back out the true\nforward state prices, we simply back out the product and ignore the\ndecomposition. The product is the risk-neutral distribution.\nIn Corporate Risk Management, we often care about true probability\ndistributions and true discount rates, so we will try to decompose the\nrisk-neutral distribution and recover the risk-premium.

Parsons\nRisk Management & the Revolution in Finance\nRisk management is a relatively new domain in finance. Why? What\nmakes it new? Why is it considered its own domain?\nRisk is an age old problem, especially in finance. Think portfolio\ntheory. And the management of risk isn't a new line of business.\nThink insurance.\nBut there is new wine in an old bottle. The practice of risk\nmanagement has been revolutionized; managers are forced to\nconfront more choices and master more complex analyses of risk\nthan ever before.\nThis revolutionary practice follows the evolution of new types of\nfinancial markets and instruments and the development of modern\nasset pricing theory.\n3⁄4 Practical roots in commodities futures exchanges and in options\nexchanges.\n3⁄4 Black-Scholes-Merton pricing and progeny.\n3⁄4 Advances in mathematics and computing.\n\nRisk Management & the Revolution in Finance\n(cont.)\nCorporate finance used to operate along a single dimension:\n3⁄4 Used to have a choice between debt or equity.\n3⁄4 Low-risk capital or high-risk capital.\n3⁄4 How much debt? End of story.\nNow, risks can be carved along many dimensions.\n3⁄4 Highly leveraged transactions create debt that functions a lot like equity.\n3⁄4 Warrants and stock options can provide highly concentrated doses of\nrisk.\n3⁄4 Creditors can ask for a repayment schedule denominated in gold, copper\nor oil.\n3⁄4 Investors can participate in various tranches of mortgages, with interest\nrate risk parcelled out into safer or very risky packages.\n3⁄4 Individual components of risk can be assigned to different parties - with\nthe construction completion risk assigned to one lender, oil price risk to\nthe bondholder, foreign exchange risk to the currency market and\noperating risk to the equity holder.\nModern corporate finance has many more choices.\nRisk Management & the Revolution in Finance\n(cont.)\nOld problems become more amenable to precision measurement\nand thoughtful design.\n3⁄4 Debt covenants aren't just grabbed off the rack in standard sizes, but\ncan be tailored to fit the features of the project or company.\n3⁄4 Financial engineering.\nThis is the revolution in corporate risk management.\n3⁄4 Many different risks have a market.\n3⁄4 Each risk can be separately measured and priced.\n3⁄4 Companies can optimize their operations, their assets, their decisions\nand their financing based on a deeper understanding of risk and a\ngreater facility in packaging and sharing the risk.\n3⁄4 The company's interface with the capital markets is more complex.\n3⁄4 Mastery of risk becomes a competitive necessity. With greater flexibility\nand increased capabilities, competition forces greater performance.\n\nWhat is Corporate Risk Management?\nRisk management as a discipline has been developed and refined\nby the practice of financial institutions, whether commercial banks,\ninvestment banks, hedge funds, or other institutions.\nThe tools they developed are useful. But the application to non\nfinancial corporations demands a different focus and presentation.\nHow? Why?\nFirst is the question, Where is value created?\n3⁄4 Middlemen buy low and sell high. Value isn't really created. It's a zero-\nsum game.\n3⁄4 Looking for mispricing. The gain comes from exploiting a mispricing.\n3⁄4 Non-financials buy inputs, process them, and deliver a product with a\nhigher value.\n3⁄4 How to make a better mousetrap, produce a product more cheaply.\nThere is no zero-sum. Looking for positive NPVs.\n3⁄4 The gain comes from finding an investment where the return more than\ncompensates for the risk.\nWhat is Corporate Risk Management?\nSecond is the focus, which this class places on the strategic element\nof risk management, i.e. the \"why\" and less on the \"how\".\n3⁄4 Less on the tactics.\n3⁄4 No menagerie of derivatives. No greeks.\n3⁄4 Tools are necessary. Practice with the tools brings insight. But the tools\naren't the focus.\n3⁄4 See why the tactics may be useful, why good tools are worth it.\n\nTopic Outline\n\nTHE ROLE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\n3⁄4\nHow Companies Manage Risk\n3⁄4\nWhy Companies Manage Risk\n3⁄4\nWhere Companies Trade Risk\n\nTHE TOOLS OF RISK MANAGEMENT\n3⁄4\nMeasuring Risk\n3⁄4\nPackaging Risk\n3⁄4\nPricing Risk\n\nTHE BUSINESS OF RISK MANAGEMENT\n3⁄4\nValuation & Pricing\n3⁄4\nAsset Management\n3⁄4\nTrading Operations\n3⁄4\nTransaction Hedging\n3⁄4\nLiability Management\n3⁄4\nFinancial Policy & Strategic Hedging\n3⁄4\nTaxes\n\nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION\n3⁄4\nAccounting\n3⁄4\nOrganization, Governance & Control\nKey Question\nFacing any problem in which the tools of this course are being\napplied, the question is,\n3⁄4 \"Can this problem be solved using traditional DCF or traditional finance\ntools, without all the distraction and unnecessary sophistication of so-\ncalled risk management?\"\n3⁄4 If the answer is \"yes,\" then throw out the unnecessary complexity and\nstick with the tried, true and widely understood tools.\n3⁄4 If the answer is \"no,\" then we have found the right issue for which the\ntools of this course are necessary.\n\nHow Companies Manage Risk\nMIT Sloan School of Management\n15. 997 Advanced Corporate Risk Management\nJohn E. Parsons\nEverybody is a Risk Manager\n\nTraditionally, corporate risk management is viewed as a treasury function -\nfor example, locking in the dollar value of foreign currency sales or\nmanaging fixed v. floating interest rate risk. Alternatively, risk management\nis viewed as a specialized line of financial business - securities and\ncommodities trading.\n\nIt's odd to think of risk management as a distinct compartment, set off and\naway from the rest of financial management.\n\nRisk is a central element of valuation and decision making.\n3⁄4\nDCF is an approach to valuing risk. No one thinks of DCF as a specialized tool\nappropriate for only one subset of financial managers.\n3⁄4\nRisk management is just turbo-charged DCF. It is a more sophisticated and more\nflexible tool for accomplishing the same tasks in more challenging and more\ndemanding circumstances.\n\nA common toolkit applied in various circumstances.\n3⁄4\nRisk analysis, risk valuation and risk management is central to all business\ndecisions.\n3⁄4\nDCF is applied very broadly. So, too, should turbo charged DCF. Every decision\nis evaluated in terms of the bottom line... the value captured. Risk matters for\ngetting the value right.\n3⁄4\nBut how this tool is employed varies according to the nature of the problem.\n3⁄4\nThis course is about these different problems, the different parts of the firm, and\nhow issues of risk arise differently and how the application of the toolkit varies to\nsuit the purpose at hand.\n\nCompany Activities\nAssets\nValuation of Real Assets\nOperating Decisions\nInvestment Decisions\nPricing Decisions\nPerformance Evaluation\nLiabilities\nCash Management\nTax Minimization\nDebt Management\nStrategic Hedging\nFinancial Accounting\nValuation and Asset Optimization\nIs the risk of a wildcat exploratory oil well the same as the risk of a\nlong-developed property?

Hedging is an action taken to\nenable the company to execute its value creating risk endeavors\nmore successfully.\nA matter of taking the right risks & layoff off the other risks.\n\nThe Right-Hand-Side\nNot a profit center.\nThe task is to facilitate the activities on the left-hand-side.\nRisk management is not a source of profit. It is the sophisticated,\nhigher-order management of the company's traditional engagement\nwith capital markets... decreasing the frictions with the external\ncapital markets.\nTypically, we do focus on hedging.\nActivities on the right-hand-side are diverse.\nThe objectives of hedging are correspondingly diverse.\n3⁄4 Reducing the cost of liquidity.\n3⁄4 Increasing the company's debt capacity.\n3⁄4 Lowering the equity required to support the business.\n3⁄4 Lowering the effective cost of capital.\nThe MM Theorem of Hedging\n\nThe original MM theorems:\n3⁄4\nThe value of the firm is determined by the cash flow stream generated by its\nassets, i.e. on the left-hand-side of the balance sheet.\n3⁄4\nThe value is unaffected by the amount of debt in its capital structure...\n3⁄4\n...nor by the amount of the cash flow paid out in dividends.\n3⁄4\nI.e. it is unaffected by actions on the right-hand-side of the balance sheet.\n\nThe MM Theorem of Hedging\n3⁄4\nHedging does not directly increase the value of the firm.\nRisk is lower.\nBut so is return.\nOn net in value terms, a wash.\nUnless there is some indirect effect.\n3⁄4\nInvestors are risk-averse, and the company should price risks the way that\ninvestors do,\n3⁄4\n...but the company does not care which fairly priced risks pass through its\nbalance sheet to investors,\n3⁄4\nThe company only cares about those risks for which it can capture an above\nmarket return - and therefore belong on the left-hand-side of its balance sheet.\n\nA Simple Example...\nFrom Lecture Notes on\nAdvanced Corporate\nFinancial Risk Management.\nUsed with permission."

Parsons and Antonio S. Mello\nChapter 1: Introduction\n1.1 The Revolution in Risk Management\nRisk management as it is currently taught is a relatively new field in the domain of\nfinance. Why? What makes it new?\nRisk has always been at the center of business. Any company that makes an investment,\nbuilds a factory, pours dollars into developing a new technology or commits resources to\nbranding a new product is taking on risk. That is how profit is made.\nAnd the management of risk isn't exactly a new line of business. Insurance companies\nhave been around for ages.\nBut risk management in the way it is now practiced in corporations and in how it is\ntaught in business schools is a new field. Something changed; something is different; something\nis new. The latter half of the twentieth century ushered in a revolution in our understanding of\nrisk. And this understanding wasn't suddenly pulled out of Zeus' head fully formed, but was built\nupon and developed in tandem with new markets in specific risks. From their origins in\nagricultural commodities and metals in the mid-nineteenth century, the use of futures, options and\nother derivatives grew and multiplied, first gradually, then exploding in the latter part of the\ntwentieth century. This development provided fertile terrain for the intellectual mastery of new\nconcepts and tools for measuring, pricing and managing risk. And the effort to understand these\nnew markets for risk also benefited from advances in mathematics and economics that made it\npossible to grapple with the complications presented by the problem.\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century corporate finance theory struggled mightily\nto cope with just two types of financing: debt and equity. Debt was low risk. Equity was high\nrisk. The company's choice was largely limited to how much debt, how much equity. Then things\nchanged. By the end of the century the risk could be carved up and packaged into more cuts than\na side of beef. Highly leveraged transactions created debt that seemed, in terms of risk, to more\nnearly resemble stock. Warrants and stock options presented us with risk distilled in more and\nmore concentrated forms. Creditors could make their loans repayable in gold or copper or oil.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nInvestors could participate in various tranches of mortgages, the level of interest rate risk\nportioned out in ever higher concentrations as the number of the tranches grew. Participants in the\nfinancing of this or that major investment project could assign the various risks to different\nstakeholders: construction completion risk to one lender, oil price risk to the bondholder, foreign\nexchange risk to the currency market, operating risk to the equity investor. Modern financial\nmanagers have many choices about risk beyond how much debt and how much equity.\nEven practices that had always been present--such as making the ultimate funding of a\ncredit or investment contingent upon key events or hurdles--suddenly became more subject to\ncareful engineering and management. The contingent events could, in some cases, be precisely\nspecified, their likelihood measured, and the value of the contingency measured in an active\nmarketplace.\nThis is the revolution in risk management. Certain risks now have a market. These risks\nare subject to careful measurement, valuation and management. Therefore corporations and other\neconomic agents can shape their business decisions, their capital investments, their operating\ndecisions, their product offerings and marketing campaigns to reflect this more precise\nunderstanding of risk, its measure and its value. Corporations have more flexibility in shaping\ntheir financing plans and their business strategy. And competitive pressures will demand that they\nexploit this possibility or fail.\n1.2 What is Corporate Risk Management?\nRisk management as a discipline has been developed primarily by and for financial\ninstitutions, whether commercial banks, investment banks or other financial intermediaries. A key\nprinciple of this course is that the tools and principles developed for banks and other financial\nintermediaries are useful, indeed, essential tools for non-financial corporations that are the\ncustomers of the banks.1\nThe perspective of non-financial corporations is essentially different than the perspective\nof financial corporations. Because of the historical development of the field, most courses in risk\nmanagement are taught from the perspective of the financial corporation, even when they claim to\n1 In the field of derivatives a distinct term came to be applied to these non-financial corporations who found themselves\ndeeply involved in these markets for risk: they were called \"end-users\". Following some of the early derivatives\ndebacles in the mid-1990s they had even formed their own advocacy and lobbying arm, the End-Users of Derivatives\nAssociation.\npage 2\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nbe addressing risk management issues generally. This course is different. It is organized\nspecifically for non-financial corporations.\nHow does this different perspective shape the course?\nFirst and foremost is the question of \"where is value created?\"\nIn many courses targeted to investment bankers, the focus is on spotting mispriced\nsecurities and profiting from them: so-called arbitrage trading. Value is captured through trading\n- buying low and selling high. Value isn't really created. The game is zero-sum. Value is\ncaptured by one party at the expense of the other. While the zero-sum game needn't, indeed\noughtn't, be the end-point of a course for non-financial corporations, it often is. And the value of\nrisk management is often taught to originate from getting the pricing right when others are getting\nit wrong. The objective is to execute the right arbitrage transaction and end up on the right side of\nthe zero-sum game.\nWhere value is actually created by financial corporations is a complicated subject that we\nwon't grapple with here. Our concern is with non-financial corporations where the source of\nvalue is, generally, easier to comprehend.\nNon-financial corporations are essentially in the business of taking a bundle of assets--\nwhether plant and equipment, or skilled employees, or intellectual property, or organizational\nskill and capabilities--and transforming a set of inputs with one market value into a set of outputs\nwith a higher market value. The transformation occurs within the company. In older style\ncompanies the transformation is transparent: wheat is transformed into bread, iron ore is\ntransformed into steel, steel, plastic and glass are worked into an automobile. In newer style\ncompanies, a similar transformation happens, but the process may be less transparent.\nRisk management for non-financial corporations is first, and foremost, about how to\nmake better investment and operating decisions so that the firm can operate and produce its\nproduct more efficiently and more effectively. There is no zero sum game. If the firm can find a\nway to produce the same quantity of output with less risk and therefore greater value, everyone\nwins. If the firm can find a way to organize the risk profile of its financings so that ultimately\nmore assets can be accumulated to produce more output at lower cost, then everyone wins. This is\nthe core subject matter of corporate risk management.\npage 3\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nA second way that the perspective of the non-financial corporation shapes this course\ncomes in the way the material is taught. We focus more on the strategic element of risk\nmanagement--the why and how--and less on the tactics and execution.\nMost risk management courses as they are currently taught focus to a large degree on the\nmathematical details, esoteric terminology and bewildering array of potential transactions that\ncould be executed and positions taken. There is an entire menagerie of derivative instruments, and\nmany a risk management course presents its own specialized taxonomy for the peculiar flora and\nfauna of this new financial world. The high level of mathematics required can be daunting, but\nalso intriguing and sometimes enchanting. Quite often it is wielded in a manner that obscures the\nrelevant business issues and the intuition that it ought to be used to develop and sharpen. Some\nrisk management textbooks revel in the long list of 'greeks' which are described in excruciating\ndetail. Others offer an exhaustive guided tour of every conceivable financial marketplace and\nfinancial security - but never address the actual business operations of the company's that are\nostensibly making use of the products.\nIn contrast, for this course the science, mathematics and esoteric details of risk\nmanagement as a specialty are secondary. These are useful only insofar as they help to illuminate\nsomething about the operations and financings of the particular business. For a course in\ncorporate risk management, it is the firm's line of business and the structure of its operations that\nmust be at the heart of the discussion. The centerpiece of corporate risk management is\nunderstanding how and why measuring, pricing and managing risk leads to better business\ndecisions. Of course, once you see the connection, you may want to dive more deeply into the\ndetails of the science of risk, but those details will be better explored in some other course.\n1.3 The Plan of the Course\nThis course is divided into 4 parts.\nThe first part is entitled The Role of Risk Management. It provides an overview and\nperspective on how risk management matters for the corporation. Chapter 2 identifies How\nCompanies Manage Risk, exploring how different parts of the company exploit the insights about\nrisk differently in executing their tasks. Chapter 3 analyzes Why Companies Manage Risk,\nanalyzing how the company's competitive position is improved and how shareholder value is\ncreated. Chapter 4 describes Where Companies Trade Risk, putting the company into context\nwith the financial marketplace.\npage 4\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nThe second part of the course is entitled The Tools of Risk Management. It discusses the\ntoolkit needed to analyze and manage risk more effectively. This toolkit is the product of the\nrevolution in finance theory that began in the last decades of the twentieth century. Chapters 5\nand 6 explain the concepts necessary for Measuring Risk. This starts with the general concept of\nexposure and the practical risk metrics that companies use. It continues with an introduction to\nthe complicated tools of stochastic processes and complex risk modeling. Chapters 7 and 8\ndescribe different ways of Packaging Risk. This includes buying and selling simple instrument\nsuch as forwards or options. It also includes dynamic strategies in which the company adjusts its\npositions through time in response to changing circumstances. Finally, Chapters 9 and 10 analyze\nthe critical issue of Pricing Risk--what's it worth. The key insights of risk neutral pricing are\nintroduced and connected to the traditional tools of risk-adjusted discounting. Then the full power\nof the tool is demonstrated in practical application.\nThe toolkit presented in this part of the course is often the exclusive focus in many\ncourses in risk management. Here we cover some of the same ground, but hopefully with an eye\nto what is most essential to getting at real world problems quickly and with the greatest insight.\nThe third part of the course is entitled The Business of Risk Management. This is the core\nof the course. Here we present the actual business actions, strategies and decisions where risk\nmanagement tools are applied. This is where we show in detail how risk management can\npotentially add to shareholder value. The section is organized by chapters around the very\ndifferent types of decisions that get made at very different locations within the company, and we\ndiscuss the role of risk and risk management in those decisions. Chapter 11 is titled Valuation.\nThe task of valuation is an age old one. The traditional discounted cash flow valuation model is\nthe workhorse of corporate finance, whether it be applied to the valuation of an asset, a new\nbusiness venture or a contract for service. The science of risk has given us more powerful and\nspecialized tools for valuation, and these will be covered here. Chapter 12 presents how these\ninsights about risk and value can be used to improve and perfect Asset Management and the day-\nto-day operations of the firm. Chapter 13 analyzes a special line of business, the Trading\nOperations, where the tools of risk management are applied in a particularly concentrated form.\nChapter 14 looks to the comptroller's functions and how risk management can improve cash\nmanagement through Transaction Hedging. Chapters 15 and 16 elaborate how risk management\nimpacts the company's Liability Management and its broader Financial Policy and the\nmanagement of the various liabilities on its balance sheet.

Big picture, not minutiae.\nGetting the Most Out of the Course\nThe simplest way to get the most out of this course is to constantly ask the question,\n\"What have I learned about risk and the valuation of risk that I didn't already know?\" When\nreviewing a case study of a corporate decision, the question is, \"Can I solve this case adequately\nusing a less sophisticated model of risk?\" \"Would a traditional DCF analysis, perhaps\nsupplemented by a little scenario analysis have been approximately as good or insightful?\"\nIf the answer to these questions is \"I learned nothing new,\" or \"The same insights could\nhave been made with a simpler analysis,\" or simply \"I don't know what more I got out of all this\ncomplication,\" then the material needs to be reviewed again. Or, perhaps, the material needs to be\nrewritten.\npage 6\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nThe bottom line for this course and these notes is to provide a new, deeper insight about a\nvariety of corporate finance problems by provider a richer, fuller analysis of risk, the price of risk\nand the tools of risk management. Hopefully, upon finishing the course and these notes, you will\nhave peered into a whole new world of richer thinking about risk, how to value and how react to\nrisk, thinking that can be applied to more successfully managing a variety of problems\nconfronting the firm.\npage 7"

Parsons and Antonio S. Mello\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\n2.1 Everyone is a Risk Manager\nThe term risk management can mean different things to different people. In the last few\ndecades, with the rise of financial engineering, the term risk management has become strongly\nassociated with the derivatives trading desks of investment banking houses and hedge funds. In a\nfew commodity industries certain firms have developed profitable trading operations built on the\nsame principles. In non-financial corporations, risk management evokes an image of the treasury\noffice buying or selling foreign currency futures to lock in the dollar value of foreign product\nsales. There is also an entirely distinct discipline that goes by the same label, risk management,\nand that is involved in identifying and limiting the probability of calamatous events, such as plant\nexplosions or the theft of corporate secrets or the loss of key personnel. Insurance companies both\ncover and help to manage and minimize these sorts of risks.\nIn truth, risk management is not a specialized activity properly relegated to any single\ntype of financial institution nor to any single office of the firm. Managers in all parts of a\ncompany regularly make all types of decisions involving choices and tradeoffs about risk. The\nmarketing department designs types of contracts for customers that share risk between the firm\nand its customers. Business unit managers evaluate alternative lines of business with different risk\ncharacteristics. Asset development teams alter project designs so as to minimize risk without\nsacrificing return. Supply chain management regularly evaluates alternative means of sourcing\nbased on risk factors. The tax, legal and accounting departments are concerned with risk, with\nhedging and with the corporate governance issues. At the highest level of the company key\nquestions about the firm's strategy and its ability to fund its operations must be answered with an\neye on the risks of each alternative and strategic decisions that can secure the greatest value for\nshareholders. Most business decisions involve a choice about risk. Everybody is a risk manager.\nRisk management is the science of assessing these tradeoffs involving risk - quantifying\nthe exposure, determining the cost of risk to the activities of your department or business unit or\ncustomer, understanding how the marketplace values and prices risk, and using this knowledge to\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nexecute your tasks successfully for the benefit of the business. Risk is an important element of\ndecisions facing managers throughout a company's many departments, and risk management\nshould be everybody's business.\nTherefore, this book develops one common toolkit for analyzing risk, and then shows\nhow these tools are used across diverse activities within the business.\nThe next section of this chapter provides a brief overview of some of the different types\nof activities and decisions involving risk which arise in various parts of a business. The objective\nis to give the student a fuller sense of the diverse settings in which a thorough understanding of\nrisk can benefit the business. This overview helps to illustrate that risk management is not a\nspecialized function carried out separate from the other parts of the firm, but instead a general\nmanagement issue relevant throughout the firm. Throughout the remainder of the course and\nthese lecture notes, we will be going into much more detail on each of these individual problems.\nBy the end of the course, the student should be able to spot and identify the risk management\nelement of each case or story.\n2.2 The Different Types of Corporate Risk Management\nAlthough the many different parts of the firm all face problems involving risk, the\nproblems are very different. The problem facing a commodity trader is not the same problem that\nfaces the business unit manager and not the same problem that faces the CFO. To gain a\ncomprehensive view of what risk management is requires a short tour through the various types\nof problems facing managers who play these different roles within the firm.\nValuation and Pricing\nValuation is central to a wide range of business decisions, from the price to pay for an\nasset to the price to charge for a product. And risk is central to valuation. Better measurement of\nrisk and better pricing of risk leads to a more accurate valuation. Armed with more accurate\nvaluations, management is able to make better decisions.\nThe workhorse for valuations is the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. In many cases\nthe DCF model produces a reasonably accurate estimate of the value. This is true because the risk\nprofile fits the usual assumptions employed by the DCF model, at least to the degree of precision\nat hand in real world cases. But in certain situations the structure of the risk is markedly different\nfrom the usual one, and the standard DCF calculation gets the valuation wrong. In these cases, a\npage 2\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nmore thorough analysis of risk is needed in order to get the valuation right. Amending the DCF\nmodel to handle this more complicated risk structure is possible. The tools of risk management\nshow how it can be done.\nThere are many complicated patterns for which a more careful treatment of risk is\nneeded. However, two very common patterns requiring more careful analysis are:\n-\nRisk is not symmetric; this happens, for example, when risk is truncated by a guarantee\nclause, by the option to switch or abandon, by floor or ceiling price structures, and so on;\n-\nRisk changes through time; this happens, for example, when the success or failure of a\nproject is decided within a concentrated window of time or when a project goes through\nmarkedly different stages during which specific risks become resolved.\nOnce you start thinking carefully about it, many projects and assets exhibit these features.\nCompanies often enter into supply agreements with various floor and ceiling price\nclauses. Supply contracts often have quantity options of various sorts. If the market price of a\ncritical input rise too far, engineers will be put to work to find substitutes or to redesign the\nproduct to minimize the amount required. Shutdown of operations, whether at just one plant or of\none product line or of an entire business line, is the most drastic \"truncation\" of all.\nChanging risk through time is just as common. For example, companies that develop and\noperate hotel properties face different amounts and types of risk through the different stages of\ndevelopment. A greenfield development, pre-construction, faces a very different amount of risk\nthan a completed property that has been operated for several years. A wildcat oil exploration\nproject faces a very different amount of risk before and after a successful find. Development of\nthe oil field is still risky, but not to the same degree and in the same way as before the first\ndiscovery was made. And once the field has been successfully developed and is simply pumping\noil, the risks have changed again. Mature products and new products face different risks.\nHere are some examples where companies have exploited the insights of risk\nmanagement to generate a better valuation:\n-\nThe oil major BP is considering adding capacity to a natural gas stabilization plant in\nEast Asia that takes natural gas piped from offshore, processes it, and delivers a pair of\nend-products: \"stabilized gas\" and condensate. An alternative design would include a\ncomplementary liquified petroleum gas (LPG) extraction facility. Adding this facility\nrequires some incremental capital investment, and would divert some of the pipeline gas\nto production of this third end-product. Given the average spread of the LPG price,\nadding this facility doesn't make any sense--the NPV is negative. But the major benefit\nof adding the facility is the flexibility it provides. The LPG plant can be operated when\nLPG prices are high and closed down when they are low. In order to assess the true value\npage 3\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nof the incremental expenditure, it is necessary to estimate the distribution of the spread\nand to identify the size of the tail of the distribution when LPG prices are at a sufficient\npremium to justify turning on the plant. This requires carefully modeling the volatile oil\nprice process. It also requires estimating an appopriate discount rate to apply to this\ntruncated distribution, one that will be consistent with the company's normal discount\nrate methodology.1\n-\nA pharmaceutical company is a portfolio of pre-product research projects, early stage\nproduct development and testing, interim product approval and marketing research, and\nmanagement of mature products. The evaluation of R&D funds to the various alternative\nprojects requires a differentiated understanding of the risk at the various stages. A study\nby the MIT Program on the Pharmaceutical Industry finds that investors' required cost of\ncapital moves down a \"risk-return staircase\" as a given project advances through the\nstages of development. The right cost of capital for the early stages of clinical testing can\nbe as high as 30%. The floor or bottom step on the staircase is the 10% cost of capital\nrequired for mature products. The cost of capital observed from financial market data on\npharmaceutical companies is actually an average of these various costs of capital,\nreflecting the distribution of investments in projects at each of the different\ndevelopmental stages. The changing cost of capital through the stages of a\npharmaceutical project are not a reflection of changing technical risks of success. The\nrisk of success or failure at a given stage for a given drug in development is just the type\nof risk that portfolio investors can diversify away and that will not add to the cost of\ncapital. Rather, the changing cost of capital reflects the changing operating leverage\nthrough time of the project. The early stages of the development process are highly\nlevered with respect to the market risks facing the project, and this leverage gears up the\ncost of capital. The MIT study shows how the estimates for the cost of capital at different\nstages are developed.2\nOnce management becomes aware of how valuation needs to be adjusted to account for\ncomplicated patterns of risk, a whole host of management processes and decisions are reshaped.\nProduct pricing is affected.\n-\nBombardier is a Canadian manufacturer of regional aircraft and business jets, rail\ntransportation equipment and recreational vehicles, including snowmobiles. The\nmarketing department for snowmobiles developed an innovative guarantee to address a\nnumber of problems. Sales respond powerfully to snowfall, but in most midwestern U.S.\ncities there was often insufficient snow in time for Christmas sales. Moreover, many\ncustomers are anxious about making a major purchase in the face of risk that they will be\nable to use it right away. So in a number of cities the company offered a $1,000 rebate if\n1 Woolley, Simon and Fabio Cannizzo, 2005, Taking Real Options Beyond the Black Box, Journal of Applied\nCorporate Finance 17(2), 93-98.\n2 Myers, Stewart C. and Christopher D. Howe, 1997, \"A Life-Cycle Financial Model of Pharmaceutical R&D\", MIT\nSloan School of Management, Program on the Pharmaceutical Industry Working Paper #41-97. See also Myers,\nStewart C. and L. Shyam Sunder, 1991, \"Cost of Capital Estimates for Investment in Pharmaceutical Research and\nDevelopment,\" Contract report prepared for the Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress, Washington DC,\nand Myers, S. C., and L. Shyam-Sunder. 1996. Measuring Pharmaceutical Industry Risk and the Cost of Capital. in\nCompetitive Strategies in the Pharmaceutical Industry. Ed. Robert B. Helms, The American Enterprise Institute Press,\nWashington, D.C.\npage 4\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nlocal snowfall was less than half the average of the past three years. While the marketing\ndepartment could forecast the impact of such a guarantee on sales, the problem was to\nestimate its cost. What was the probability of paying the rebates? And what was the price\nof risk? Bombardier didn't actually make this estimate. Instead, it turned to others in the\nfinancial market and covered its obligation by purchasing weather derivatives--payments\nbased on the snowfall--for every snowmobile it sold. Bombardier's counterparty at the\ntime was Enron --this was back in 1998--and for each snowmobile sold Bombardier\npaid a price ranging between $45 and $400, depending upon the city. So the cost of the\nguarantee was determined by the financial markets and Bombardier's sales department\nsimply had to decide if the expected sales warranted the price to be paid. The guarantee\nwas a success, resulting in a 38% increase in sales over the prior year, and Bombardier\nexpanded the program to other cities the next year.3\n-\nA local heating oil company delivers oil to residential and commercial customers under a\nvariety of terms. The basic contract lets the price of oil delivered float with the market.\nBut many residential customers prefer to lock in the price just before the winter heating\nseason begins. They sign a contract to take delivery as needed at a fixed price. Other\ncustomers want security, but don't like the high price charged for locking in a single price\nthroughout the full season. They prefer a contract with a cap and a floor, but accept\nvariation in price within that range. How should the company set the fixed price? What is\na fair level for the cap and for the floor? If the quantity purchased by each consumer were\nfixed, these contracts would mimic simple options contracts sold on the major\ncommodity exchanges. But typically the consumer is entitled to these price terms on\nwhatever quantity of oil they actually use in their home that season. And the quantity\nconsumed obviously fluctuates with the severity of the weather, which in turn is\ncorrelated to the price level. How should this quantity risk be factored in when setting the\nfixed price to charge customers?\nOperating Decisions and Asset Management\nBetter valuation tools also empower management to make better operating decisions and\nmanage assets more profitably.\nHere are some examples:\n-\nAn asset manager at an integrated oil and gas company is responsible for working up the\nprogram for development and exploitation of its proven, but undeveloped reserves of oil.\nAt current prices, the NPV of development is positive. But the price of oil is very risky\nand could fall dramatically so that the low revenues would not repay the sunk\ndevelopment expenditures. Holding the properties undeveloped until the price rises\nfurther could be the wiser strategy. The value of these properties is really a call option on\nthe price of oil. When should this option be exercised? How high does the oil price have\nto be before it makes sense? Solving this development problem requires a sophisticated\n3 Many sales arrangements include warranties and other provisions that can be readily modeled as options. In some\ncases, such as lease agreements, the options are explicit. The value of the cancellation and purchase options in\nautomobile lease contracts is estimated in Giaccotto, Carmelo, Gerson Goldberg and Shantaram Hegde, 2007, The\nValue of Embedded Real Options: Evidence from Consumer Automobile Lease Contracts, Journal of Finance 62(1),\n411-445. They show that the penalty provisions included in the lease nullify the value of the cancellation option and\nthat the value of the purchase option is equal to about 16% of the market value of the used car.\npage 5\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nunderstanding of oil price dynamics. It is important to distinguish between short-run,\ntransitory price shocks that one can predict will dissipate relatively quickly, and shocks to\nthe price that are long-lasting. Important information can be gleaned from the term\nstructure of oil futures prices, so that the development decision should depend not just on\nthe current price of oil, but on the full term structure. Finally, the asset manager need to\ndecide what s/he anticipates about the likely evolution of drilling costs and other costs -\nare they tied to the price of oil or independent of it?4\n-\nThe Boeing Company employs risk management financial valuation tools in the\nevaluation of investments in new aircraft designs. The manufacture of new aircraft\ninvolves many critical stages. At each stage different risks are confronted and the\ndevelopment program is either scrapped, delayed, redesigned or continued. Throughout\nthe process the company is receiving information, learning about the market and about\nthe technology, so that the risk distribution it faces is changing. Moreover, the\nmanufacturer often has to choose between different development paths that have different\nrisk profiles. The prudent expenditure of scarce development funds requires assessing the\nvalue of information generated. There are choices to be made in the pace of development\nspending and in the sequencing. Valuing these choices demands a structured model of\nrisk. Boeing's use of a disciplined valuation methodology that accomodates these risks is\na useful tool in getting managers to be explicit about a range of future scenarios. It avoids\nresort to vague claims of 'strategic value' since long-shot game changing designs are\nreadily fit into the valuation model.5\n-\nIn 2000, Hewlett Packard found itself short of supplies of the flash memory components\nof its profitable laser printers due to a rapidly expanded use of the component in the cell\nphone industry. In order to assure production of its printers, HP entered into a long-term\ncontract, but at a higher price. The experience convinced the company to implement a\nProcurement Risk Management (PRM) program to evaluate its choices in negotiating\nsupplies, including how much to purchase under contract, at what prices, what sort of\noptions to place on future supplies and how large of a premium to pay for the option. HP\ncompares the option premium against the cost of maintaining excess inventory as a\nhedge. To implement the PRM the company employs the same type of analytic models\nand software systems that investment banking houses employ at their trading desks. The\nsystem requires HP to make a careful assessment of the markets for its supplies, to\nunderstand price dynamics and the likely directions of costs. But it also requires HP to\nunderstand the internal costs of risk. How much will it lose from a delay in printer\nshipments? What is the value to the company of its inventory?6\n4 There is a large literature on the valuation of oil properties using option pricing tools. In fact, this example inspired\none of the very first papers on 'real options': Siegel, D., J. Smith, and J. Paddock, 1987, Valuing Offshore Oil\nProperties With Option Pricing Models, Midland Corporate Finance Journal 5, 22-30.

Curiously, Boeing claims to have a patent on this\nmethodology!

(accessed from the web in July 2007).\npage 6\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nCash Management and Transaction Hedging\nThe Finance/Comptroller/Treasury Office is responsible for managing the short-run cash\nflow of the firm. Uncertainty in the cash inflows and outflows is expensive. The more\nuncertainty, the larger the reserve of cash and other very liquid, low return assets the Treasury\nmust maintain. Risk management tools can be used to minimize expensive uncertainty in short-\nterm cash flow, lowering the amount of working capital the firm requires. These assets can then\nbe invested in less liquid investments that yield a higher return. Alternatively, the freed up assets\nare available for major corporate investments or can be returned to shareholders.\nThis type of hedging--managing the firm's short-run cash flow--is called transaction\nhedging. The classic example of transaction hedging is a multinational firm that has made a sale\nin a foreign currency for which payment will not be received until delivery is complete some\nmonths hence. The firm wishes to lock in its domestic currency income and it does so by selling a\nforward contract on the foreign currency, exchanging future payment of the foreign currency for\nfuture payment of the domestic currency.\nThe right size and structure of a transaction hedge is simplest to assess after the\nunderlying transaction has formally been executed. In many cases, however, it is possible to\nanticipate with a reasonable degree of certainty many transactions expected in the near term, and\nthe firm may hedge these as well. Most natural resource extraction companies can predict a\nminimum quantity of production within a term of a number of months or a year. Because these\nsales have not yet been closed, these sales will be made at whatever turns out to be the market\nprice in the months ahead. Over a longer term the company might want to adjust its production in\nresponse to changes in the market price. But in the near term, the volume of production may not\nvary significantly and the firm simply hedges to reduce the risk of this near term cash flow. A\nnatural gas producer sells forward or futures contracts on its expected production for the next six\nmonths. An agricultural commodity producer may similarly sell forward some portion of its\nexpected harvest. A livestock company may sell forward some fraction of the animals it expects\nto bring to market.\nUsers of commodities may do the same. Petrochemical refiners may buy forward a\nportion of the crude oil used to feed their operations over the coming months. Multinational\ncompanies may buy currency forward to lock in the domestic currency price they pay on some of\ntheir supplies. Each of these is a case of transaction hedging.\npage 7\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nHedging transactions is very different from supply management or product pricing,\nbecause hedging is a purely financial action. A transaction hedge does not generate delivery of an\ninput or an output.\nAlthough transaction hedging is the simplest form of hedging, occasionally things don't\nwork out as planned.\n-\nDuring the winter of 1995 and 1996, several US natural gas producers with fields in east\nTexas - including Apache, Cabot Oil & Gas, Enserch, Sonat, TransTexas Gas and Union\nPacific Resources Group - found that they had rung up big losses on the hedges they had\nsold on the New York Mercantile Exchange's natural gas futures contract. The NYMEX\ncontract is based on delivery of gas into the Henry Hub in Louisiana, near the starting\npoint of major pipelines heading up the east coast. The losses stemmed from an\nunprecedented run-up in the futures contract price following a surprise shortage of gas in\nthe northeast US. Unfortunately for these companies, however, prices in east Texas had\nnot increased the same amount since east Texas production traveled up a different set of\npipes leading to the US midwest, and the price spike had been localized exclusively to the\nnortheast. So the losses on the hedges were not matched by gains on the underlying sales,\nand the companies found themselves scrambling to cope with the cash drain. The hedges\nthat were supposed to protect the companies from surprising cash shortfalls had suddenly\ncreated a cash shortfall. The companies had not anticipated that such a large differential\nbetween east Texas and Louisiana was possible, and going forward they needed to adjust\ntheir hedge ratios to accommodate the danger.\nLiability Management\nOn a longer time frame, the firm also worries about risk exposure created by the debt it\nhas issued. Some companies attempt to structure their liabilities to match their assets on various\ndimensions. For example, companies with long-lived assets may be more willing to issue long-\nterm debt, while companies in a high asset turnover business will choose shorter-term debt that\nturns over more often. Companies with tangible assets may be willing to borrow more.\nCompanies also try to match the currency denomination of their debt to the currency of\ntheir revenues, avoiding the mismatch in cash flow that can arise if the exchange rate quickly\nfalls. This matching can be done either by issuing the debt in the relevant currency, or by issuing\nthe debt in one currency and supplementing the debt with a hedge. The hedge could be a long-\nterm swap of currencies, or it could be a dynamic portfolio of futures on the two currencies.\nAn interesting example of liability risk matching is the issuance of commodity linked\ndebt by companies who mine and sell the commodity.\n-\nFreeport McMoRan is one of the world's largest producers of gold. It operates the\nGrasberg mine in the Papua province of Indonesia. In the early 1990s it wanted to expand\npage 8\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nthe mine from 52,000 metric tons or ore per day to 90,000 tons, at a cost of $545 million.\nA second expansion to 118,000 metric tons would cost even more. The company was\nalready highliy levered. In 1990 its book leverage ratio was 66%. Between 1991 and\n1993 it issued $157 million in long-term bank debt, $219 million in LYONs, a\nspecialized debt instrument with an equity option, $560 million in convertible preferreds,\nand $174 million in equity. The company was constrained by a number of debt covenants\nand probably had no more capacity to issue traditional debt. In August 1993, however,\nthe company issued a gold note. Both the quarterly dividend and the principal value of\nthe note were indexed to the price of gold - if the gold price went up, the company would\npay a larger dividend, and ultimately a larger principal payment, and vice-versa. The\ncompany issued a second gold linked note in January 1994 and a silver note in July 1995.\nThe total raised on the three issuances was $450 million. By linking the payments on the\ndebt to match the risk profile of the company's underlying production, the company may\nhave expanded its debt capacity and made the expansion possible.7\nInterest rate risk is also an important element of this long range liability risk\nmanagement. Smaller companies often find it easier or cheaper to borrow directly from banks\nthan to borrow by issuing a bond. But bank debt is typically floating rate. Many companies use\nthe interest rate swap market in order to convert their floating rate bank debt into a fixed rate\nexposure.\nNot all firms may be trying to lower their risk when managing their liabilities. Some may\nactually be trying to play the market, using their balance sheet to make a bet on the direction of\ninterest rates - WalMart, for example. A recent study found evidence that the corporate use of\ninterest rate swaps seems motivated by the desire to 'ride the yield curve' - i.e., benefit in the\nshort run from low short run interest rates and avoid, in the short run, the higher fixed rate - and\nthat WalMart may be a prime example. \"... at the end of Wal-Mart's 2001 fiscal year, during\nwhich the yield curve was inverted on average (specifically the average 1-year Treasury yield was\nhigher than the average 10-year Treasury yield by 9.5 basis points), they had swapped only 3.9%\nof their debt from a fixed to a floating interest rate exposure, resulting in an overall floating debt\nexposure of 18.7%. During the 2002 fiscal year, the average Treasury yield spread (the 10-year\nTreasury yield minus the 1-year Treasury yield) had risen to 1.75% and Wal-Mart\ncommensurately increased their use of pay-floating interest rate swaps to 17.3% of debt, bringing\n25.3% of their debt to a floating exposure. Finally, during the 2003 fiscal year, the Treasury yield\nspread had risen further to an average of 2.59%, and Wal-Mart again increased their use of pay-\nfloating interest rate swaps to 32.6% of total debt, leaving 40.8% of their debt with a floating\nexposure. At the culmination of these swap activities, Wal-Mart noted in their 2003 annual report\n7 Chidambaran, Fernando & Spindt, 2001, Credit enhancement through financial engineering: Freeport McMoRan's\ngold-denominated depository shares Journal of Financial Economics 60, 487-528.\npage 9\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nthat \"interest costs on debt and capital leases ... as a percentage of net sales [decreased] 0.17%\nwhen compared to fiscal 2002.\" In fact, their interest expense fell by $269 million (18.5%) even\nthough their total debt increased by $3.5 billion (16.1%).\"8\nFinancial Policy and Strategic Management\nA company's financial needs are dynamic and respond to changes in the key risk factors\nshaping the company's cash flow. The changing marketplace for its products has repurcussions\nfor the company's investments in future product development. Some products reach maturity and\nrequire little incremental investment and the product margin is free cash flow to the firm. Other\nproduct lines enter into a stage of transition and face new competitive pressures, so that additional\ninvestments in those lines are a drain on free cash flow. Changes in macro variables such as\nexchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices shape the timing of these developments and the\nsize of the cash flow freed up or the investments demanded.\nThe company's financial policy, therefore, needs to be dynamic. The policy needs to be\ndesigned in anticipation of these risky developments and cash flow needs. Risk management is\nabout shaping the company's relationship to external capital markets through time and in\nresponse to these exogenous factors. A company may wish to tailor the dynamic risk profile of its\nsources of cash so that they match the company's strategy and match the risk profile of its\ninvestment plans, or so that they give the company a competitive boost when it is most valuable\nagainst its competitors.\nThe pharmaceutical firm Merck noticed that it was significantly exposed to currency risk.\nIt had a mismatch between the currencies in which it earned its revenues and in which it paid its\ncosts. Currency risk in and of itself was not Merck's concern, however. It's shareholders could\nabsorb this risk as a part of their overall portfolios.

This type of speculation appears to be quite widespread. Faulkender studied\n133 firms in the chemical industry, analyzing 275 debt issuances over a period six years from 1994 through 1999, and\nfinds that firms are more likely to choose floating rate debt if the yield spread is large (i.e., the short rate is below the\nlong rate. The data incorporates the exposure at issuance, but including any swapping of exposure from fixed to\nfloating or vica-versa. A one standard deviation in the yield spread, 44.5 basis points, increases the probability of\nfloating from 30% to 41%.\npage 10\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\ndevelopment spending. Merck decided this was hurting its value. It needed to manage its foreign\nexchange risk in order to protect its R&D investments and the future growth value of the firm.9\nCompanies often take extreme opposite positions on the contribution hedging can make\nto shareholder value. Famously, many small gold mining companies believe that many of their\nshareholders own the shares in order to gain exposure to gold price risk - the so-called 'gold\nbugs'. These companies don't want to hedge gold price risk because it will drive away a sizeable\nclientele for their stock. Others in the industry view hedging as essential to their growth strategy.\nDuring the ealy 1990's the two largest North American producers pursued diametrically opposed\nstrategies: Homestake Mining vociferously proclaimed its decision to remain exposed, while\nAmerican Barrick advertised how its hedging strategy enabled its swift expansion. The different\nstrategies could reflect the two managements' different assessments of the relevant factors. Or,\nthe two companies may have faced very different strategic situations that called for different\nsolutions.10\nHaving sampled a broad range of risk management problems, we now turn to providing a\nmore comprehensive picture of whether and how firms manage risk.\n2.3 Evidence on How Firms Manage Risk\nEvidence on how firms manage risk comes in several different forms. Knowledge of\ncases such as those discussed above is one form. A broad acquaintance with the diverse practices\nof various companies is certainly an important perspective on the question of how firms manage\nrisk. A second form is a survey about specific practices. A survey can be conducted through a\nquestionnaire, or by analyzing corporate financial reports. Surveys have been made about the\ncapital budgeting tools firms use - for example, do they limit themselves to traditional DCF, do\nthey employ the Real Options method? Surveys have also been made about whether and how\ncompanies used derivative securities for hedging exposures. In fact, recently adopted accounting\nrules (starting in the 1990s) require companies to disclose information about their portfolios of\nderivative securities, and so this data provides a window on companies' hedging activities. A\nthird form of data is the indirect empirical evidence that identifies how risk management practices\n9 Lewent, Judy C. and A. John Kearney, 1990, Identifying, Measuring, And Hedging Currency Risk At Merck, Journal\nof Applied Corporate Finance 2(4), 19-28.\n10 An early paper on hedging in the gold industry is Tufano, Peter, 1996, Who Manages Risk? An Empirical\nExamination of Risk Management Practices in the Gold Mining Industry, Journal of Finance 51(4), 1097-1137. A large\nliterature has followed.\npage 11\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nimpact other observable variables, such as market values of certain assets or the operating actions\nof firms.\nMany, many interesting analyses of firm risk management have been published. We\nreview just a few of these here.\nCase Studies\nGregory Brown conducted a very detailed case study of foreign exchange risk\nmanagement at a large US multinational industrial firm with more than $10 billion in sales.11 He\nspent three months in the Spring of 1998 in the treasury department of the company, examining\neach of the company's foreign currency trades, observing the company's decision making and\noperations, and interviewing management. The company had foreign exchange derivatives\nwritten on 24 currencies. The notional value of foreign exchange derivatives at year end was\napproximately $3 billion, and the notional value of transactions made during the year was over\n$15 billion. Foreign exchange hedging is handled by a management team of 4 persons with a total\nof 11 full-time employees and at an administrative cost of about $1.5 million, with roughly half\nthe cost being employee compensation. Transactions costs, usually in the form of bid-ask spreads,\naverage $2.3 million, annually.\nThe firm's hedging focused on a very short horizon of less than a year. The company\nmaintains a set of maximum and minimum hedge ratios for transactions by quarter horizon as\nfollows:\n11 Brown, Gregory, 2001, Managing Foreign Exchange Risk With Derivatives, Journal of Financial Economics 60,\n401-448.\npage 12\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nExpected time to exposure\nMinimum Hedge\nMaximum Hedge\nCurrent quarter\n60%\n90%\n1 quarter\n40%\n90%\n2 quarters\n25%\n85%\n3 quarters\n0%\n85%\n4 quarters\n0%\n85%\nHedging exposures more than four quarters out was possible only with special approval. Similarly\nexceptions could be made to the hedge ratio bounds with special approval or under specified\ncircumstances.\nReducing the volatility of a firm's cash flow is often thought to be the major role of\nhedging, and so Brown analyzed the impact of the firm's hedging on this variable. He had access\nto the full transaction level detail on the company's portfolio, and so could presumably measure\nthe impact of the firm's hedging better than many other studies which attempt to do the same\nanalysis using the courser set of information available in financial statements. Brown found that\nhedging reduced the volatility of annual cash flow and earnings by approximately 10%. In dollar\nterms, this amounted to a reduction in annual changes of about $4 million on mean earnings of\n$170 million - a surprisingly low number given the cost of running the program.\nPerhaps the most important finding in Brown's study is the fact that foreign exchange\nrisk management was primarily an element of the company's short-run budgeting and planning\nfunction. The risk management process is focused on developing a set of short-run exchange rates\nthat everyone must employ in planning and evaluating short-run decisions - setting annual\nbudgets, sales targets etc. Foreign business units use a treasury forecast of their foreign exchange\nexposure together with the hedge rate in developing their business plans. \"A treasury training\nmanual states, `the primary currency risk management directives are (1) to increase the certainty\nof operating margins by supporting planning and pricing decisions with expected rates and by\nhedging forecasted exposures and (2) to reduce negative impacts from currency movements on\ncompetitiveness by continuously managing forecasted transactions and by providing competitive\ninformation to senior management. \"\nSurveys\nAs the sketch of risk management problems opening this chapter suggests, the use of\nderivatives is only one element of risk management at corporations. But since derivatives are\nclearly an important element of active financial management of a firm's exposures, observations\npage 13\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nabout how they are used are important. Studies quantifying the use of derivatives can be broken\ninto two groups. First, are those which study use by a broad sample of companies across many\nindustries and focusing on portfolios of foreign currency and interest rate derivatives. Since many\ntypes of firms are exposed to exchange rate and interest rate risk, it makes sense to cast the net\nwide and include companies from various industries. Second, are those which focus on\ncompanies in a single industry exposed to a common commodity price risk for which there exist\ntradeable financial securities. For example, in North America there are many companies whose\nprimary business is mining gold, and the price of gold is a clear and dominant risk for the revenue\nof these companies, and gold futures and many other related financial instruments are readily\navailable. Similarly, there are many oil producing firms with revenues tied to the price of oil, and\nother industries, such as airlines, for which fuel is a major operating cost. The oil futures and\noptions markets are among the deepest in the world, and so analyzing the hedging practices of\nfirms on both sides of the oil price seems natural. Agriculture is another industry for which one\nmight extract some lessons by observing how firms make use of derivatives, especially since\nagricultural commodities played a central role in the original development of organized futures\nand options exchanges.\nTo give a very broad summary of the results, we can say that:\n-\nDerivative use is focused equally on foreign currency and interest rate risk and to a\nsignificantly smaller degree on a few key commodities such as oil, natural gas, and\nmetals.\n-\nAggregate exposures currently hedged by these financial portfolios seem relatively small.\nHedging is focused on relatively short maturities, although for foreign exchange and\ninterest rates, the maturities can go out to a few years. For other risks the focus is on one\nto three years at most.\n-\nThere is a great diversity in financial hedging activities. A few firms hedge a lot, while\nmany firms do not hedge at all. Firms often change their financial hedging strategies\nmarkedly in time. Larger companies make more use of derivatives, as it is costly to set up\na hedging capability.\n-\nThere is some evidence that the use of derivatives is tied to identifiable features of the\nfirm's business or financial structure, but this is still a murky area.\n-\nThe use of financial derivatives is clearly growing.\nForeign Currency Derivatives\nIn a study of 720 large U.S. corporations, approximately half of which have foreign sales\naccounting for more than 10% of total sales, and reporting financials from 1990 through 1995, it\nwas found that approximately 37% of the total population of firms had some amount of foreign\npage 14\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\ncurrency derivatives (futures, options and swaps). The percentage increases from 32% in 1990 to\n40% in 1995. If the sample is restricted to just those with firms with foreign sales, the percentage\nof those using derivatives is higher, 60%, growing from 55% to 64% between 1990 and 1995.\nThe amount of derivatives used also increases from an average of $105 million in notional\nprincipal to $279 million, measured across all firms. 12\n\nAverage 1990-1995\nAll Firms\n37%\n32%\n40%\nForeign Sales > 0\n60%\n55%\n64%\nForeign Sales = 0\n15%\nAverage $ Notional\n$105 million\n$279 million\nInterest Rate Risk\nA study of 2,600 non-financial corporations and their financials in the years 2000 and\n2002 found that 500 reported using derivatives in 2000 and more than 600 in 2002 -- i.e.,\nbetween 20 and 25%.13 We can see how diverse was the portion of interest rate risk hedged by\nreproducing this table from the study:\n\n# obs.\n10th\nSwaps as a Fraction of Total Debt*\n25th\nMedian\n75th\n90th\nPay-floating\n2%\n4%\n16%\n31%\n47%\nPay-fixed\n-5%\n-14%\n-28%\n-51%\n-83%\nNo direction\nUnknown\nPay-floating\n5%\n11%\n18%\n34%\n48%\nPay-fixed\n-5%\n-14%\n-32%\n-60%\n-97%\nNo direction\nUnknown\n* Notional value of pay-floating interest rate swaps minus the notional value of pay-fixed interest\nrate swaps, caps and collars, as a percent of total debt.\n12 Allayanis, George, and James P. Weston, 2001, The Use of Foreign Currency Derivatives and Firm Market Value,\nReview of Financial Studies 14(1), 243-276. In this study large firms are defined as those with more than $500 million\nin sales. A number of firms not reporting any foreign sales also report using foreign currency derivatives--15%. Some\nof these firms may have had exposures to currency movements due to the use of imported goods as inputs or due to\ncompetition from imports.\n13 Covitz, Daniel, and Steven A. Sharpe, 2005, Do Nonfinancial Firms Use Interest Rate Derivatives To Hedge?\nWorking Paper, Capital Markets Section, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\npage 15\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nAccording to the study, larger firms are more likely to use interest rate derivatives:\nderivatives use by size declines from 43%, 28% to12% in 2000 and from 57%, 36% to 15% in\n2002. Likewise, higher rated firms are more likely to use derivatives: falling by rating category\nfrom 43%, 38%, 28% to 10% in 2000 and from 58%, 53%, 30% to 12% in 2002. Although large\nand highly rated firms appear to use derivatives more, the net effect of derivatives on interest rate\nrisk appeared to be greatest for those small, low rated firms who used them. Non-users tended to\nbe companies who had borrowed fixed. Among users of interest rate derivatives, the situation is\nvery different as between large and highly rated companies (over $5 billion in assets, and A rated\nor above) and small and poorly rated companies (under $1 billion in assets, and BB rated or\nlower, including unrated). For large and highly rated companies there was no discernable pattern\nof use. Smaller and lower rated firms are more likely to have to turn to banks for credit, as\nopposed to accessing the bond market. And banks lend short-term and at variable interest rates.\nTherefore, firms accessing banks and getting variable rate loans turn to the swaps market to\nconvert to fixed rate. Before accounting for their derivative use, these smaller and lower rated\nfirms had a much larger pay-floating exposure than the larger and more highly rated firms, but\nafter accounting for their derivative use the net position of the two groups was indistinguishable.\nA study of small, credit constrained firms, shows that these companies consistently prefer\nfixed-rate loans, and those companies in industries with a greater sensitivity to interest rate\nshocks are more likely to use fixed rate loans. When these small companies use adjustable rate\nloans, it is because that is what the market is making available to them - i.e., it is a supply-side\nphenomenon, not a demand-side one.14\nEarlier in this chapter, we cited a study by Chernenko, Faulkender and Milbourn (2006)\nthat found firms using the interest rate swaps market to ride the yield curve. A closely related\nstudy by Faulkender found this type of speculation to be quite widespread, focusing on an\nanalysis of 133 firms in the chemical industry with 275 debt issuances over a period six years\nfrom 1994 through 1999. He finds that firms are more likely to choose floating rate debt if the\nyield spread is large - i.e., the short rate is below the long rate.15 This appears to argue that firms\nchoose floating in order to ride the yield curve, i.e., benefit in the short run from low short run\ninterest rates and avoid, in the short run, the higher fixed rate. The study also finds that (1) there\n14 Vickrey, James, 2005, How and Why Do Small Firms Manage Interest Rate Risk? Evidence from Commercial\nLoans, Federal Reserve Bank Working Paper.\n15 Faulkender, Michael, 2005, Hedging or market timing? Selecting the interest rate exposure of corporate debt, Journal\nof Finance 60, 931-962.\npage 16\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nis no correlation with the firm's cash flow exposure to interest fluctuations, but that (2) during\neconomic downturns firms are less likely to choose floating - i.e., they look for the safety of fixed\nto reduce their exposure. The former result is interpreted as arguing against firms using interest\nrate exposure on their debt to hedge interest rate exposure on their assets. The latter finding is\ninterpreted as suggesting that firms respond to the increased cost of interest rate risk, i.e., the\npotential probability of default and costs of distress.\nGold Producers\nThe hedging practices of the North American gold mining industry have received a great\namount of attention and analysis. A study by Peter Tufano of HBS analyzed hedging by 48 firms\nusing quarterly data from the four year period 1990-1993.16 Companies in the industry regularly\nprovide detailed information about their use of a wide array of financial instruments including\nstandard forward, futures and options contracts as well as less familiar tools such as spot deferred\ncontracts, gold loans and gold swaps. The study took advantage of a database of hedging\npositions compiled by an equity analyst following the industry. One of the most interesting facts\nto emerge is the great diversity in hedging practices. Defining a company's quarterly hedge\nposition (delta) as the ratio of its effective financial short position (e.g., sales of gold forward) to\nits forecasted production.17 In this study, the data includes hedges with a horizon of three years\nand as well as forecasted production within three years. This quarterly hedge ratio is then\naveraged for each company over the sixteen quarters studied.\nTufano's figures reveal that 14.6% of the firms did not hedge at all, i.e., sold all of their\noutput at the spot price, while 16.8% of the firms hedged 40% or more of their production. The\nmedian hedge ratio was 22.9%. In no case did a firm use its financial portfolio to increase its\nexposure to gold prices, although in at least one case a firm did have a hedge ratio for a single\nquarter of 146%. The main variable that Tufano finds to provide at least a partial explanation for\nthe different hedge ratios is managerial stock holdings. When management owns more stock and\nso is very exposed to gold price risk, the company hedges more. However, when management\nowns more options which would benefit from volatility, the company appears to hedge less.\n16 Tufano, Peter, 1996, Who Manages Risk? An Empirical Examination Of Risk-Management Practices In The Gold\nMining Industry, Journal of Finance 51, 1097-1137. Later studies include...\n17 The delta is a sophisticated measure that takes into account the value sensitivity of option contracts that may be in or\nout of the money and that have a greater or lesser time to maturity. The precise meaning of delta will be given later in\nthe text.\npage 17\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nAs we will see, the high variability in the size of hedging by different firms is a constant.\nThere is little unanimity about the causes of this. It remains an important puzzle.\nOil and Gas Producers\nHaushalter studied 100 independent oil and gas producers and their hedging activity\nduring the years 1992-1994.18 He, too, finds the amount of hedging is highly variable.\nApproximately half of the firms did not hedge any production. Among those that did hedge, the\naverage amount hedged was between 24% (median) and 30% (mean) of one year's production,\nalthough some hedged more than 70% and one hedged 90%. There seems to be more hedging in\nthe gas portion of the industry than the oil portion. The most widely used hedging tools were oil\nprice swaps, followed by fixed price contracts, followed by forwards and futures contracts.\nOptions were used by a minority of hedging firms--10.5%. Interestingly, even within such a\nshort period of time, companies change their hedging from year to year so that the correlation\ncoefficient between the fraction of production hedged in 1992 and the fraction hedged in 1994 is\nonly 0.582. Larger companies are more likely to have some kind of hedging program in place,\nalthough size does not explain the amount of hedging. Companies with more debt and who are\nfinancially constrained hedge more. Haushalter's results on managerial stock ownership and\noption positions are not entirely consistent with Tufano's results for the gold industry: greater\noption positions do lead to less hedging, but so do greater stock positions. Finally, a key\ndeterminant of hedging was geographical basis risk: hedging is more prevalent among companies\nwhose production is located primarily in regions where prices have a high correlation with the\nprices on which exchange-traded derivatives are based. For these companies the exchange-traded\nderivatives are more likely to be an effective hedge.\nJin and Jorion studied 119 U.S. oil and gas producers and their hedging activity during\nthe years 1998-2001.19 Roughly 1/3 of the sample (measured in firm years) is engaged in hedging\nboth oil and gas, and 1/3 in hedging neither. The remaining 1/3 hedges either oil alone or gas\nalone. Most of the sample, 92 out of 119 firms, reported at least some hedging activity in at least\n18 Haushalter, David, 2000, Financing Policy, Basis Risk, And Corporate Hedging: Evidence From Oil And Gas\nProducers, Journal of Finance 55, 107-152. In limiting the sample exclusively to firms primarily engaged in oil and gas\nproduction, the study excludes from the sample firms more popularly thought of as oil firms--such as Exxon and\nChevron--which are also engaged in refining and marketing among other things. The pool of firms is therefore smaller\nthan what one might casually think of as \"the oil industry.\"\n19 Jin, Yanbo and Philippe Jorion, 2006, Firm Value and Hedging: Evidence from U.S. Oil and Gas Producers, Journal\nof Finance 61, 893-919. Compared to Haushalter, this study takes advantage of more detailed risk disclosures required\nby the SEC in 1997. As with Haushalter, this sample excludes the large oil majors.\npage 18\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\none year; 47 reported oil hedging in each year and 68 reported hedging gas in each year. Out of\n324 firm years with oil exposure, fewer than half, 146, hedge oil. Among hedging firms, the mean\noil hedge ratio was 33% of next year's oil production and 4% of oil reserves: the median values\nwere 24% and 2%. No firm had a negative ratio; i.e., companies did not speculate, but used\nderivatives to reduce their exposure. Out of 325 firm years with gas exposure, slightly more than\nhalf, 174, hedge gas. Among hedging firms, the mean gas hedge ratio was 41% of next year's gas\nproduction and 5% of gas reserves: the median values were 33% and 4%. No firm had a negative\nratio. Hedging firms are much larger than non-hedgers--on average, two to three times the size.20\nAirlines\nThe airline industry represents a nice counterpart to the oil and gas producing industry\nsince for airlines the price of jet fuel is a major cost of production--approximately 14% of\nrevenues. Carter, Rogers and Simkins studied the hedging strategies of 28 US and US based\nairlines over the period of 1992-2003.21 The average hedge ratio, comparing financial securities\nlocking in the price of fuel with one year's consumption, was 15%. But this ratio varied between\n0% for several firms, to 80% for Southwest Airlines. Ten of the 28 airlines--more than one-\nthird--did not hedge in any of the years. The major airlines were the most likely to hedge, and the\nsmaller airlines the least likely.\nSouthwest Airlines considered its hedging strategy to be integral to its competitive\nstrategy. The 2005 10K report trumpets the company's successful perfromance: \"This\nperformance was driven primarily by strong revenue growth, as the Company grew capacity, and\neffective cost control measures, including a successful fuel hedge program.\" And, in the words of\nScott Topping, Southwest's vice president and treasurer, \"Fuel hedging will continue to play a\nstrategic role in the industry and be a potential source of competitive advantage.\"\n20 See also Chang Dan, Hong Gu and Kuan Xu, The Impact of Hedging on Stock Return and Firm Value: New\nEvidence from Canadian Oil and Gas Companies, Working Paper, 2005. \"In this paper we analyze the impact of\nhedging activities of large Canadian oil and gas companies on their stock return and firm value. Differing from the\nexisting literature this research pays particular attention to possible nonlinear payoffs of hedging activities, which may\nnot be fully revealed in the traditional linear framework. By using generalized additive models, we find that the factors\nthat affect stock return and firm value are indeed nonlinear. The large Canadian oil and gas firms are able to hedge\nagainst downside risk induced by unfavorable oil and gas price changes. But gas hedging appears to be more effective\nthan oil hedging when downside risk presents. In addition, oil reserves tend to have a positive (negative) impact on\nstock returns when the oil prices are increasing (decreasing). Finally, hedging, in particular hedging for gas, together\nwith profitability, leverage and reserves, has a significant impact on firm value.\"\n21 Carter, David, Daniel Rogers, and Betty Simkins, 2006, Does Hedging Affect Firm Value? Evidence from the U.S.\nAirline Industry, Financial Management 35, 53-86. The results of this study have been retold in slightly more popular\nform in Carter, David, Daniel Rogers, and Betty Simkins, 2006, Hedging and Value in the U.S. Airline Industry,\"\nJournal of Applied Corporate Finance 18(4), 21-33.\npage 19\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nCarter et al. (2006) also present some insight into the structure of a hedging program with\nan illustration from Lufthansa which shows how the hedge ratio and the instruments used vary\nwith the horizon of the exposure being hedged. \"Lufthansa hedges up to 90% of its planned fuel\nrequirements on a revolving basis over a period of 24 months ahead. ...[B]eginning 24 months\ninto the future, they start hedging 5% of their requirements using Brent Crude Oil Collars each\nmonth, incrementally increasing the level to 90% at seven months into the future. To minimize\nbasis risk (i.e., the price difference between crude oil and kerosene), Lufthansa also hedges using\ncrack spread collars. A crack spread collar involves the use of a pair of options (such as buying a\ncall option and selling a put option where the hedge locks in a price range) on the crack spread\n(the difference in value between crude oil and the products such as kerosene refined from it).\nSince hedging kerosene for longer periods is expensive, Lufthansa combines the hedging of crude\noil with short-term hedging of the crack spread. Lufthansa starts implementing the crack hedging\nstrategy six months ahead at a monthly rate of 7.5%. As a result, 45% of basis risk is hedged\nusing crack spread collars by the time the fuel is used.\nFingerprint Evidence\nIn addition to individual case studies on how companies manage risk and how broad\nsamples of companies use derivative securities, there are a miscellany of studies assessing other\nevidence of the types of risk management being discussed in these lectures. Think of this as a\nforensic exercise: identifying the fingerprint of risk management.\nThe first class of studies analyzes whether the market price of certain assets appears to\nreflect the elements of value highlighted by sophisticated risk evaluation or whether a less\ndifferentiated cash flow valuation appears to do the trick. For example, Quigg studied real estate\ntransactions in Seattle between 1976 and 1979, including 3200 developed and 2700 undeveloped\ninvestment properties. She calculated an 'intrinsic value' (aka a simple DCF) for each\nundeveloped property and also a valuation that recognized the highly risky upside in undeveloped\nproperties (i.e., the \"option value\"). She found that market prices for the undeveloped properties\ncontained a premium above the value estimate made using the DCF, and the market price was\nbetter predicted by a model that recognized this option value. According to her findings, 6% of\nthe market price was an option premium, with a range of 1%-30%.22\n22 Quigg, Laura, 1993, Empirical testing of real option-pricing models, Journal of Finance 48, 621-640.\npage 20\n\nChapter 2: How Companies Manage Risk\nBerger, Ofek and Swary studied the market value of a large sample of publicly traded\ncompanies with data between the years 1984 and 1990. Using analyst forecasts of earnings, they\ncalculate a naive present value of cash flows. They also calculate a more sophisticated value that\nrecognizes how the ability to liquidate assets of the firm offers some protection on the downside -\nthe abandonment option. The calculation is based off of key line items of each company's balance\nsheet and an estimate of the value of these items in liquidation. They find that the market value of\nthe companies are better explained by the more sophisticated - i.e., real option - model of value\nas opposed to the naive present value of cash flows. 23\nA second class of studies attempts to identify the lessons in risk management not in the\nprices themselves, but in the asset management decisions of management. For example, Moel and\nTufano analyze the opening and closing decisions of 285 North American gold mines during\n1988-1997. They focus on \"economic\" opening and closing decisions - i.e., those not related to\nfactors such as exhaustion of the mine or a strike, and which therefore are likely to have been\nmotivated by movements in the price of gold and the profitability of extraction. As we will show\nlater, the insights of risk management change the recommended mine management rules - how to\nmake open and closure decisions contingent on movements in the price of gold. They found a\nnumber of patterns in the opening and closing decisions that are inconsistent with the simplistic\nDCF model and better explained by a decision model that recognizes the complex risk issues at\nhand.24\nDikos and Thomakos (2007) document how investments in the oil tanker market matched\nagainst charter rates appear inconsistent with a simplistic DCF model and instead reflect the\noption to wait and delay investment until a later date, a key risk management concept for\ninvestment decisions.25\nA third type of study looks for \"natural experiments\" where something is exogenously\nchanged, either in the risks facing the firm or in the marketplace for risk instruments. The\nresearchers then attempt to use this sudden change to identify how companies and managers\nadjust their risk management behavior. An interesting example is a study by Gron, Beatty and\n23 Berger, Philip G., Eli Ofek and Itzhak Swary, 1996, Investor Valuation of the Abandonment Option, Journal of\nFinancial Economics 42, 257-287.\n24 Moel, Alberto and Peter Tufano, 2002, When Are Real Options Exercised?

During\nthese two years the price of product liability insurance increased so dramatically that these\nresearchers use the event as a sort of natural experiment. Not only did the price rise, but insurers\nlowered coverage limits and charged higher deductibles. The study's authors identify 55\ncompanies who had been insured prior to the dramatic price increase, and follow them through\nthe subsequent years to observe how they respond and what determines the different responses.\nAs certain theories about the interaction between risk management and capital structure would\npredict, the firms who were most likely to stop purchasing product liability insurance and bear the\nrisk themselves were firms with no debt or otherwise fewer financing constraints. Similarly, the\nresearchers find that when management holds more options, especially out-of-the-money options\nthe firm is more likely to stop purchasing the higher priced insurance. Perhaps most interestingly,\nthe authors document that firms who continue to purchase insurance appear to otherwise adjust\ntheir behavior so that the underlying business reflects more risk relative to those who do not\ncontinue purchasing the insurance.26\nIf there are studies that show the irrelevance of risk management, ... well, ... you\nwouldn't expect to read about them in these notes, would you?\n26 Beatty, Anne, Anne Gron, Bjorn Jorgensen, 2003, Corporate Risk Management: Evidence From Product Liability,\nWorking Paper.

Parsons and Antonio S. Mello\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\n3.1 Which Side Are You On?\nAlthough the many different parts of the firm all face problems involving risk, the\nproblems are very different. As we mentioned in the last chapter, the problem facing a\ncommodity trader is not the same problem that faces the business unit manager and not the same\nproblem that faces the CFO. Because the problems facing each actor within the firm are different,\nthey require a focus on different risk related issues.\nIt is helpful to think about the different offices and activities of a company along the\nsame dividing line used to organize a typical accounting balance sheet: assets on the left and\nliabilities on the right. Figure 3.1 is a listing of different activities within a typical corporation\norganized in a layout that mimics a balance sheet's layout--assets on the left, liabilities on the\nright. Organizing the different activities according to this left/right, asset/liability split is\ninstructive and useful.\nActivities on the left are the traditional sources of value for non-financial corporations.\nInvestments are made, operations are managed, and value is produced and realized through the\nsale of the company's products. This is where the firm's competitive advantage is usually thought\nto lie, whether in the low cost of its production, or the premium margins on its products, or the\nvalue of its R&D portfolio, or the organization of its human capital.\nOn the right-hand-side of Figure 3.1 are the auxiliary activities that support and facilitate\nthe productive activities of the firm. These are the activities that are normally considered the\ndomain of the financial office or related departments. This side includes the main interface with\nthe capital markets.\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nFigure 3.1\nWhere Is Risk Management Relevant? A Balance Sheet Metaphor\nAssets\nLiabilities\nValuation of New Assets\nCash Management\nOptimization of Operations\nTax Management\nProduct Pricing\nForeign Operations Reporting\nSupply Chain Management\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nR&D Strategy\nAccounting\nThird Party Contracts\nDebt Funding\nManagement Incentives\nEquity Issuances\nFinancial Flexibility\nIt is tempting to think of this right hand side as the natural locus of risk management\nactivities. The buying and selling of derivative securities is often restricted to the treasury or other\noffices falling under the chief financial officer. When people think of \"hedging\" and \"who\nhedges\", this is what usually comes to mind. And if risk management were purely a zero-sum\ngame played on the financial markets, then this assignment would be true. But that's a wrong,\nlimited view of corporate risk management. It overlooks half of the ways that risk management\nraised shareholder value. Risk management happens on both sides of the balance sheet.\nBut the sources of value are different on the two sides.\nThe Left-Hand-Side: Taking Risks to Earn a Return\nOn the left-hand side are the various business units actually making investments,\noptimizing the operation of assets, choosing product lines and pricing structures, setting up\nsupply chain structures, doing performance evaluation. For these activities, risk management is\nfirst and foremost a decision making tool.\npage 2\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nIf management is to build a successful business, it needs to be able to answer questions\nsuch as these:\n-\nWhat is the value of that asset? How much is this extra risk worth?\n-\nIf I target a riskier value added product line, is the incremental profit worth the risk?\n-\nWhat is the risk-reward tradeoff involved in delaying an investment, in developing a\nmore flexible production scheme?\n-\nDo I pay a premium to lock in a more reliable supply schedule? What is the downside\nrisk worth?\n-\nHow long do I keep funding a speculative research and development program? When do I\npull the plug?\nIn none of these situations is management trying to avoid risk. In none of these situations is the\nobjective to hedge risk. Businesses make money by assuming risk. Every capital investment\nproject involves spending cash up front in exchange for the gamble of future, uncertain cash\nflows. Expanding operations means expanding risk.\nThe task in all of these situations is to accurately assess, measure and price the risk, so\nthat management can then make the right decisions about what to pay, how much to invest, how\nto operate assets, organize production, price and market products, and so on. Risk management is\nan input to all elements of good business management. The task is not to reduce risk, but to face it\nwisely.\nIn a few cases the correct business decision may be to lay off the risk, to pass it to another\nparty.\n-\nFor example, this is done in the case of major construction projects by writing the terms\nof the contract to specify whether the contractor or the investor is responsible for cost\noverruns or changes in input prices. Assigning the risk of delays to the contractor is done\nas an incentive device, to motivate the contractor to perform on time, or as a negotiating\ndevice, to motivate the contractor to provide a realistic estimate up front. The investor\ndoes not have an aversion to the risks, per se--just an aversion to a contract structure that\nwould create unnecessary risks.\n-\nThe Bombardier example from Chapter 2 is another case in which the company did not\nhold onto the risk created the money-back guarantee it offered to customers. It hedged\nthis risk to its counterparty, Enron. In this case, the company is laying off the risk\nbecause it has no expertise in estimating the size and price of the risk. To make the right\nbusiness decision on whether to offer the guarantee, it needs to know the cost, and the\nmost reliable estimate of cost comes in the form of a simple price charged by an arms-\nlength transaction with another party willing to accept the risk.\npage 3\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nThe profitable management of a business always involves choosing among alternatives,\nand may involve accepting some risks while avoiding others. What is the company's competitive\nadvantage in risk taking? It should load up on those risks associated with its skills and\ncompetitive advantage. Other risks are unrelated to its skills and competitive advantage, and it\nwill lay them off wherever possible to improve its focus and maximize the profitable use of its\nlimited resources.\nRisk management is about understanding the risks, the cost of risk, the price of risk, the\nvalue of risk, and knowing what choices are available, knowing where the firm can sell the risk,\nknowing what packages of risk can be easily sold into the market and what not.\nOn the left-hand-side, risk management is a problem of measurement, pricing and\nvaluation. These risk management skills are all targeted to the problems of evaluating alternative\ninvestments, optimizing alternative operating strategies, comparing across alternative contract\ndesigns and terms, ranking alternative product pricing plans. Risk management enables the firm\nto value and price its activities more precisely, recognizing the varying quantities of risk in\ndifferent activities, determining the market price for that risk, thereby better assessing the true\nprofitability. Of course, with this power of more accurate valuation of risk comes the ability to\ncompete better by offering a more finely tuned and targeted portfolio of products and services, the\nability to lower costs by honing in on risky and therefore expensive activities and managing away\nthe costly risk.\nThe value of risk management on the left-hand-side is direct: the company chooses more\nvaluable assets, better prices its products, minimizes the risk-adjusted cost of delivering the same\nservices, and so is more profitable.\nThe Right-Hand-Side: Economizing on Risks\nOn the right-hand-side, risk management is one of negotiating the firm's relationship\nwith the capital markets. Here risk management is about reducing the company's cost of liquidity,\nincreasing the firm's debt capacity, lowering the equity necessary to support a given line of\nbusiness, lowering the firm's effective cost of capital and so expanding the resources available to\nit. Value is created on the right-hand-side because there are frictions in the capital market, and\nrisk management greases the wheels, making the interface between the company and the financial\nmarkets operate more smoothly, more effectively, at less cost and with less disruption to the\ncompany's strategy.\npage 4\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nThe value of risk management on the right-hand-side is indirect. Risk management\nenables the firm to do more with less -- more real assets with less financial capital. Starting from\na limited pool of risk capital, risk management enables the firm to expand the scale of its\noperations on the left-hand-side. It is this expansion of profitable operations -- the left-hand-side\nof the balance sheet -- that generates value. But it is the risk management activities on the right-\nhand-side of the balance sheet, that indirectly makes expansion on the left-hand-side possible.\nThe indirect paths through which risk management generates value on the right-hand-side\nof the balance sheet are many, and the intermediate objectives risk management accomplishes are\ndiverse. All of these intermediate objectives have as their end-point increasing shareholder value.\nIn most cases (but not all) the risk management activities involve one form of hedging or another\n-- i.e., reducing the company's exposure to risk. But beyond that, these different activities may\nhave little in common.1\nWhy does reducing risk raise the value of the company? In the next few sections, we'll\nbriefly survey a couple of these ways.\nReducing the Cost of Working Capital\nA large volume of what passes for risk management in corporations is targeted to little\nmore than cutting down on the company's need for cash balances and for accessing the money\nmarkets.\nThe vast majority of hedging involves buying and selling futures contracts with a very\nshort maturity--usually much less than one year. For example, a U.S. company may have\ninvoiced a foreign buyer in its local currency, but wishes to lock in the dollar price. The company\nexpects payment within 90 days and sells the currency forward, fixing the receivable in dollar\nterms. Many oil and natural gas field operators know the quantity they are likely to produce in the\ncoming month or months, and they sell this amount forward, locking in the price at horizons of\none, two or three months. This is called transaction hedging.\n1 A tragically good example in which risk management increased shareholder value by increasing risk is the case of\ncase of savings and loan institutions (S&Ls) during the 1980s. Many of these financial institutions had experienced\nlosses which threatened their long term viability. But because the government's loan guarantee covered those losses\nwithout charging the institutions a fee tied to the risk, it became advantageous for some to double up their risks. If\nthings turned out well, they could continue as profitable operations. If things turned out poorly, the government was left\ncovering the higher losses. Inevitably, many of the S&Ls went bankrupt, and the bill was enormous. This forced a\nmajor reform of the system and gave a useful push to more sophisticated risk-based capital regulation systems. See, for\nexample, White, Lawrence, 1991, The S&L Debacle: Public Policy Lessons for Bank and Thrift Regulation.\npage 5\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nThe company's basic operating plans and decisions are unaffected by the hedging. The\nhedge is planned and executed after these basic operating decisions have been made. The hedge\naccommodates the operating decisions, not the other way around. Therefore transaction hedging\ndoes not directly improve the productive value of the firm's operations or investments.2\nThese short-run hedges also do not significantly impact the company's major exposure to\nexchange rates or oil and gas prices. The vast majority of the value of these companies is tied to\nthe expected sales in years 2, 3, 4, 5 and beyond. If the exchange rate moves against the U.S.\nmanufacturer, it will become less competitive and lose future sales, no matter how firmly it locks\nin the dollar value of sales already made. If the oil price collapses, the producer will drop in value\nbased on the expectation of lost revenue on later sales.\nSo why hedge the near-term transactions and not the long-term ones? Why focus on sales\nalready in the bag and ignore expected sales down the pike?\nThe answer is that the objective isn't really to lock in overall value, per se. The hedge is\nreally meant to deal with a cash flow planning problem. The company's treasury has to anticipate\nthe amount of liquidity it needs and keep on hand sufficient cash to meet its obligated payments.\nWith enough notice, it can find the most efficient, low cost means to do so. But the dangers of\nvariability in its daily cash flow obligations forces the firm's treasury to maintain a certain\namount of its assets in liquid, low return instruments. The greater the variability in daily cash\nflow obligations, the higher the cash inventory it requires, and the greater the return forgone. If\nthe company can lower the volatility of its cash flow obligations, it can reduce the cash inventory\nit holds and shift that capital into assets earning a higher return.\nA second advantage of transaction hedging is that results across business units and across\ndifferent quarters are made more comparable. The transaction hedge helps to lock in the return\nthat management negotiated when it made the decision to execute the sale or to buy the product.\nSubsequently exchange rate and commodity price movements could wipe out the profit, or create\na windfall that had nothing to do with management's decisions. Short-run hedging improves the\nmeasurement of certain types of performance.\n2 Another dubious motivation for transaction hedging is to lock in a favorable price in the forward market. While there\nmay arise cases in which a corporate manager has some basis for believing that the forward price is better or worse than\nthe expected future spot price, this is unlikely to be a reasonable foundation for shaping on ongoing transaction hedging\npolicy.\npage 6\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nLong run volatility in prices is central to the company's competitive decision and its\nmajor business decisions, but not to its short-term cash management strategy. In the short-run\nmany key business decisions have already been taken, and the firm faces a simple exposure that\ncan be readily hedged.\nThese short-term hedges do not in any significant way alter the firm's left-hand-side\nactions. But they do lower the cost of working capital that the company needs to keep in order to\nfinance the activities on the left-hand-side of the balance sheet.\nLiability Structure\nSome forms of longer range hedging need not come in the form of trades in derivatives,\nbut can be built into the regular liability structure of the firm. A company with significant\nrevenues in a foreign currency may choose to issue a portion of its debt in that currency. This\nmatching of the risk profile of the liability to the risk profile of the revenue stream increases the\nlikelihood that the firm will be able to pay its debt even in the event of an unfavorable movement\nin the exchange rate. Minimizing the likelihood of a period of financial distress has the obvious\nbenefit of saving on the direct costs incurred in such a crisis, costs such as lawyers fees,\nconsultants fees, and myriad other burdensome charges. But the indirect costs of the threat of\nfinancial distress can be larger still.\nThe relationship between creditors and shareholders is smooth when financial distress is a\nremote possibility. As the threat of distress looms closer, the relationship becomes more\nconflictual and this has an impact on the firm's actual operations. Creditors begin to enforce loan\ncovenants that restricts the firm's use of funds and its investments and asset disposals.\nShareholders begin to concern themselves less with what maximizes the value of the firm as a\nwhole, and more with what maximizes the long-run value of the stock, possibly at the expense of\nthe firm and its creditors. These conflicts lower the value of the firm. Structuring the debt ex ante\nso as to minimize the probability that these conflicts arise, increases the value of the firm ex ante.\nStructuring the risk profile of the debt, tailoring it to the risk profile of the firm, is one tool for\ndoing so. Risk management of the debt structure indirectly raises the value of the firm by\nreshaping the incentives of the creditors and shareholders so that the right operating and\ninvestment decisions get made in the future, even when the company's profitability is impaired.\nChanging the risk profile of the debt does not directly improve the stock value. Selecting a\ndifferent risk profile does not get the firm a 'deal' on the price of its debt. But indirectly, through\nchanges produced also on the left-hand-side, risk management on the right-hand-side is helpful.\npage 7\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nFinancial Policy and Strategic Management\nSome corporations integrate risk management into their strategic plan. If the company's\nplans call for major capital expenditures, asset acquisitions or a well funded R&D program, then\nhaving the financial flexibility to complete these plans can be critical to shareholder value. Risk is\nno longer a simple gamble that sometimes yields gains and sometimes losses. Short-term losses\nmay have large consequences. If the company is forced to cut back its capital expeditures or its\nR&D, then valuable opportunities are lost and the stock price suffers a double whammy. A well\nplanned hedging strategy implemented up front can be used to assure that the company will have\nsufficient capital resources on hand to execute its strategy.\nOnce again, the value of the risk management strategy is indirect. The specific\ntransactions used in the strategy - the gains and losses on a dynamic hedge portfolio, for example\n- are not the real source of value. But because the gains are made when the company needs cash,\nit is able to follow through on positive NPV investments and expand the value produced on the\nleft-hand-side of the balance sheet. And hopefully the losses are made when the company has\nsufficient cash and therefore is not sacrificing extra value by forgoing negative NPV investments.\nThe strategic value of hedging comes not only in the direct form of being able to fund\nthis or that planned investment, but also indirectly through how a company's financial flexibility\naffects its competition with industry rivals or its relations with key customers. Analyzing this\nstrategic interaction can be very difficult, but also very important.3\n3.2 The MM Theorem of Hedging\nIn addition to discussing how risk management adds to company value, it is useful to\naddress one popular misconception about how hedging raising market value.\nStudents of corporate finance are familiar with the Modigliani-Miller irrelevance\ntheorems. The essential core of the theorems is that the value of the firm is determined by the\ncash flow stream generated by its assets, i.e., on the left-hand-side of the balance sheet, and not\nby the amount of debt in its capital structure or the amount of the cash flow paid out in\n3 Dasgupta, Sudipto, and Sheridan Titman, 1998, Pricing Strategy and Financial Policy, Review of Financial Studies\n11, 705-737. See also Downie and Nosal (1998) who show a firm that risk management can help a firm with market\npower in the product market achieve a first-mover advantage over its rivals See also Mello, Antonio and Martin\nRuckes, 2005, The Role of Hedging in Product Market Rivalry, Working Paper.\npage 8\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\ndividends.4 Although the propositions were originally developed to address the choice between\nfinancing with debt or equity, and the choice of whether to pay a dividend or retain the cash, they\nare justly celebrated because the underlying principle behind the theorems has a very broad\napplication to most all activities represented on the right-hand-side of the balance sheet. Hedging\nis one such activity.\nThe MM theorem of hedging says that, the value of the firm is independent of whether or\nnot it hedges. The firm's value is determined by the cash flow stream generated by the assets, i.e.,\non the left-hand-side of the balance sheet. If the firm lowers the risk of its cash flow stream by\nselling a risky cash flow in the market in exchange for a low risk cash flow--i.e., by hedging--\nthe value of the firm is unchanged.\nTable 3.1 illustrates the MM theorem using as an example an oil producer valuing its next\nyear's production. The first set of rows shows a valuation of the unhedged cash flow. The firm\nplans to produce 10 million barrels of oil. The forecasted spot price is $35/barrel, so the firm's\nexpected revenue is $350 million. The risk-adjusted discount rate applied to this oil revenue\nstream is 10%, so the present value of this expected revenue is just over $318 million.\nThe second block of rows shows the value of hedging this risky cash flow by selling\nfutures contracts. We assume the hedge ratio (size of futures position divided by the size of the\nunderlying quantity of the commodity being hedged) is 1, so that the company opens a short\nposition in the futures contract for 10 million barrels. The futures price for this 1 year's\nproduction is $33.09/barrel. The futures market for oil is deep and liquid, so we are entitled to\nthink of this futures price as a competitive market price. We assume that the futures are settled\nfinancially and we abstract from issues of margining. Then at the maturity of the contract, the\nfirm receives the difference between the futures price and the realized spot price. For valuation\npurposes, this is equivalent to the firm receiving the futures price and paying the spot price, so to\nvalue the hedge we value a cash inflow at the futures price and a cash outflow at the expected\nspot price.\n4 Strictly speaking, absolute irrelevance is based on the assumption of no taxes. We make that assumption here as well,\nand address the problem of taxes later below.\npage 9\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nTable 3.1\nThe MM Theorem of Hedging\nUnhedged Valuation\nForecasted Production (000 bbls)\n10,000\nForecasted Spot Price ($/bbl) -- current price $38\n$35.00\nForecasted Spot Revenue ($ 000)\n$350,000\nRisk-adjusted Discount Rate, r\n10.00%\nPV ($ 000)\n$318,182\nHedge Valuation\nSize of Position -- (000 bbls short, i.e., sold)\n10,000\nFutures Price\n$33.09\nForecasted Hedge Inflow @ Futures Price\n$330,909\nRiskless Discount Rate, rf\n4.00%\nPV ($ 000)\n$318,182\nForecasted Hedge Outflow @ Expected Spot\n$350,000\nRisk-adjusted Discount Rate, r\n10.00%\nPV ($ 000)\n$318,182\nPV Net Hedge Inflows & Outflows ($000)\n$0\nNet Position Valuation\nTotal PV Forecasted Spot Sales + Hedge ($000)\n$318,182\nThe expected cash inflow is $330 million, while the expected cash outflow is $350\nmillion. So on average, we expect the short futures position to yield a negative cash flow. But it is\nnot just the size of the futures cash flow and the expected spot cash flow that differ. The discount\nrates that are applied to the cash flows differ as well. Because the futures price is fixed at the time\nthe hedge is purchased, we discount the expected cash inflow at the riskless rate. This is 4% in\nour example. Because the expected cash outflow fluctuates at the spot rate, we value the expected\ncash outflow at a risk adjusted rate reflecting spot price risk. This is 10% in our example. The\npresent value of the two cash flows exactly match one another. They are both $318 million.\nTherefore, the present value of the net position is zero. Adding the hedge on top of the firm does\nnot change the firm's value.\nOne key feature of Table 3.1 is that present value of the cash inflow and the cash outflow\non the hedge are equal. This must be true in an efficient capital market. The forward price,\npage 10\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\ndiscounted at the risk free rate, must be equal to the expected spot price discounted at an\nappropriate risk adjusted discount rate. If we change the forecasted spot price in the example, but\nkeep the forward price fixed, then we must change the risk adjusted discount rate. If we do not\nmake this change, then we are assuming a free lunch: anyone can buy or sell futures contracts at a\nprofit.\nAnother underlying assumption is that there is an efficient capital market uniting both the\nvaluation of the cash flow stream generated by the firm's assets and the cash flow streams on any\nhedge to be bought and sold by the firm. The price at which the high risk cash flow stream can be\nsold in the market is the same price at which the high risk cash flow stream earned by the firm\nwould be valued by its shareholders. And that the price at which the low risk cash flow stream\ncan be bought in the market is the same price at which the low risk cash flow stream would be\nvalued by its shareholders. This assumption makes sense for a wide range of situations relevant to\nlarge corporations. For all intents and purposes, they sell their shares and their bonds in the same\ncapital market that they can buy and sell hedges on their exposures. Of course, there are many\ncases where this assumption does not apply. For example, in any small firm where a single person\nhas a majority of their own personal wealth tied up in the assets of the company.\nThe MM theorem of hedging does not, ultimately, say that hedging has no value to the\nfirm. It just says the value does not arise directly from the exchange of a risky and riskless cash\nflow with different market values. The presumption is that hedging exchanges a risky and a\nriskless cash flow of equal value. So, in the first order, hedging leaves the value of the firm\nunchanged. However, changing the risk profile of the firm's cash flows can, indirectly, yield\nvalue to the firm. This indirect or second order benefit from hedging can arise in many ways as\nwas described above and as will be explored in more detail in Part III of these lectures, The\nBusiness of Risk Management.\n3.3 Risk-Aversion and the Value of Hedging\nThe MM theorem of hedging seems to fly in the face of a very large economics literature\non the design of an optimal hedging strategy. Papers in that literature begin with a risk-averse\nagent who must buy or sell some commodity, and, depending upon the various assumptions about\nthe risky price and other matters, they derive an optimal hedge ratio. In that literature, hedging\ndirectly benefits the agent. If the agent is a firm, then this directly contradicts the MM theorem.\nHow does one square these two approaches?\npage 11\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nThe MM theorems assume an efficient capital market. Given an underlying set of real\neconomic activity with all of the attendant risks, these capital markets establish a market price for\neach type of risk. The total set of risks from the underlying economic activity is ultimately\ntransferred to the global pool of investors. It is the risk-aversion of this pool of investors and their\nportfolio optimization choices that determine, in equilibrium, the market price for each type of\nrisk. The firm will only be able to buy and sell risk in the capital markets at the equilibrium\nmarket price. The firm can hold more or less of any given risk, but it will pay the market price for\nthis risk, leaving its total value unchanged. While the firm can hold more or less of any given risk\nvia a hedge, ultimately the same total set of risk from the real activity of all firms still gets passed\nalong to the global pool of investors. Hedging only changes the channels by which that happens.\nWhether a given risk is passed along as a part of the equity cash flow, or whether that risk is\nseparated off and passed along as a part of a futures hedge, is irrelevant. The MM theorems\nassume that the firm's shareholders are just a random sample, indistinguishable from the rest of\nthe global pool of investors, and that the shares they own of the firm are just a part of a well\ndiversified portfolio. The same is true of the counterparties to the futures hedge. That's why the\nchoice of channel doesn't matter and why the valuation of the risks is unchanged by any firm's\nhedging decisions. In the MM world, firms are just an intermediary shell where the real economic\nactivity is organized. Firms pass along the value in the form of risky cash flows. The amount of\nrisk channeled through the firm has no relevance for the value of the firm. The only thing that\nmatters is the underlying set of economic activities. If those are unchanged - if the left-hand-side\nof the balance sheet is unchanged - then firm value is unchanged.\nThis is a very good assumption for a large segment of our corporate economy. And the\nMM theorem of hedging is a critical touchstone for students who want to understand risk\nmanagement. But the assumptions behind the MM theorem don't apply to many other segments\nof the economy. When that is the case, then the firm's risk can directly matter in many important\nways.\nOne such case in which the MM theorem of hedging does not apply is when shareholders\nare not well diversified. The founders of most start-up companies, for example, usually have a\nlarge fraction of their wealth tied up in the fortunes of that single company. Another example\nwould be a nation that is heavily endowed with wealth from a single commodity such as oil. In\nthese cases, these models with risk aversion make some sense, and there is obviously a potential\nvalue to hedging. But it is important to understand why this does not generalize to the standard\npublicly traded multinational corporation.\npage 12\n\nChapter 3: Why Companies Manage Risk\nModels of risk aversion are also sometimes used as a reduced form representation of a\nmuch more complicated situation. For example, we may say that a company is risk averse within\na given time frame and towards a specific risk because in a larger, more comprehensive model\nfitting the MM framework there arises naturally a premium price for this risk borne by the\ncompany. Managers of a company may make decisions for the company as if the company were\nrisk averse because their own performance is evaluated and incentivized in a may that is\nequivalent to risk aversion. Again, it is important to understand the real source of this risk\naversion.\nIn all of these cases, while a model of risk aversion makes sense and can be used to tell\nthe moral of the story, it is very difficult to know how to parameterize the model and derive\nmeaningfully calibrated quantitative results that can guide decision making. It is hard to know\nhow to benchmark the measures of risk aversion. In the model of external capital markets, the\nprice of risk can be benchmarked against market data on rates of return earned on various types of\ninvestment. Despite the many controversies over the right asset pricing model for measuring the\nprice of risk, the range is narrowed by this data. The task is more difficult in these other cases.\nThis is especially true when risk aversion is a proxy for indirect costs of risk, since the nature of\nthe indirect costs varies on a case-by-case basis.\nEarlier in this chapter we discussed the various right-hand-side of the balance sheet\nactivities of the firm for which risk management may be useful indirectly. The indirect value in\neach of these cases is a little like the 'risk aversion as proxy' cases. There are particular internal\nactivities and processes of the firm which can be executed more cheaply, efficiently or\nsuccessfully given a carefully tailored risk profile for the firm's internal cash flows. These\nindirect benefits yield results much like what one would get by assuming risk aversion on the part\nof the firm. But as we model these right-hand-side activities in more detail later in these lecture\nnotes, we derive the correct measure of the benefits. We do not assume a simple risk-averse\nutility function. In general, it is more insightful to model the actual factors driving the need for\nrisk management and to let the model show us what sorts of risk management yield a benefit. It is\nseldom the case that the right answer matches what one would get from assuming a crude risk\naverse utility function.\npage 13"

Parsons and Antonio S. Mello\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk-Dynamic Models\nPart A--The Random Walk Model of Stock Prices\nRecent decades have witnessed revolutionary advances in the tools used to model risk\nand to price risky financial assets. The Black-Scholes-Merton approach to option pricing has been\ngeneralized to all corporate liabilities, including stocks, bonds and derivatives of all types. This\napproach is now commonly used to price mortgage obligations, currency agreements, insurance\ncontracts and myriad other financial instruments. Most recently, the approach has been extended\nto the valuation of real options, investments in real assets such as the development of oil fields,\nthe operation of electric generating plants and the negotiation of options to purchase aircraft.\nThe engine under the hood of every real options model is a stochastic process model of\none or more critical variables or factors--the oil price, for example. A stochastic process model is\na parsimonious description of the dynamics governing the evolution of the variable through time.\nIt captures long-term trends--such as any forecasted long-term increase in the price. It captures\nshort-term dynamics such as seasonal fluctuations, as well as the tendency of sudden price shocks\nto reverse themselves. And it captures all elements of uncertainty, both short-term shocks that are\ndissipated and long-term shocks that persist and are compounded. Once the stochastic process\nmodel is specified and its parameters estimated, an analyst can value all varieties of real assets\nwith cash flows tied in any complicated way to the factor.\nHow well the engine runs depends upon what you put in it. If the model accurately\ncaptures the dynamics--both in general structure, as well as in the precise values of the\nparameters--then the risk assessment and valuations made using the model will be useful. If the\nmodel is inaccurate, then, ...well, then we have a problem. So it is critical for the corporate\nmanager to understand the essential characteristics of alternative models and be able to evaluate\nthe fidelity of the model to the dynamics of the factors and risks driving their business.\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nThis chapter is predicated on a distinction between the underlying factor and the\nderivative asset. First we model the underlying factor. Then we determine how the cash flows or\nvalue of an asset is derived from this underlying factor - hence the term 'derivative'. Then we try\nto understand how the risk from the underlying factor is translated into risk for the asset.\nSome students will be familiar with the tools here as developed for modeling stocks and\nother financial instruments. Our analysis is meant to apply more generally. Any variable can\nconceivably be a factor, and we need to think about the many ways that risk should be modeled\nfor the full diversity of variables that can be factors. Because our analysis is meant to be very\ngeneral, students should be cautious about applying all of the results learned in the context of\nmodeling financial assets. The equilibrium conditions determining the prices of financial assets\nimpose specific conditions on the models used. Since we are modeling general variables, not just\nfinancial assets, the equilibrium conditions may not apply and the models may have properties\ndifferent from what the student is familiar with.\nIn this chapter we have tried to strike a difficult balance. We present the bare essentials of\nstochastic process modeling, attempting to minimize the mathematical detail, while still providing\nenough material to enable the reader to actually implement and evaluate these models. We\npresent a broad selection of models which embody very different structures of risk and which we\nbelieve give the reader a good feel for the various risk patterns that can be modeled. But, of\ncourse, the full library of potential models is much larger, and the true specialist will know that\nwe have only touched the surface. We have tried to select models that we believe provide a useful\nrepresentation of relevant factors--for example, a good model of the oil price that can be reliably\nused to assess the risk of major oil related capital investments. In doing so, we have chosen to\nbrush aside aspects that we believe are of lesser significance for corporate managers, although\nthey may be significant for short-term money managers speculating on oil futures. All of these\nchoices involve judgment and reasonable people may differ. This is our best shot.\n6.1 Discrete Time Stochastic Process\nWe start with the standard discrete time stochastic process model for stock prices, the\nrandom walk model. Suppose that we want to analyze a stock with an average annual return of\nμ=12%, also known as the drift, and volatility σ=22%. Suppose further that we are analyzing the\nstock's possible movement through the horizon T=2. We divide this into N total periods or n\nperiods per year, n=N/T, where the length of each period is Δt=1/n. If n=12, then each period is a\npage 2\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nmonth and Δt=0.0833, if n=52, then each period is a week and Δt=0.0192, if n=250, then each\nperiod is a trading day and Δt=0.0040, and so on. We mark off the N points in time as t0, t1 ...\nti,... tN, with t0=0 and tN=T. Figure 6.1 below illustrates this structure.\nThe initial stock price, S(t0), is given. The return earned over the period from t0 to t1,\nR(t1), and therefore the next period stock price, S(t1), are random variables. We define the return\nas the continuously compounded return so that:\nS(ti ) = S(ti-1)e\nR(ti ) ,\n(6.1)\nor equivalently,\nR(ti ) = ln⎜⎜⎛\n⎝ S\nS\n(\n(\nt\nt\ni-\ni\n)\n) ⎟⎟⎞\n⎠\n= ln(S(ti ))- ln(S(ti-1)).\n(6.2)\nAn important property of continuously compounded returns is that they are additive: the\ncumulative return over any horizon, R(t0,ti), is equal to the sum of the returns over that horizon.\nOne can see this by analyzing the recursive calculation of the price:\nS(t1) = S(t0)e\nR(t1)\nand\nS(t2) = S(t1)e\nR(t2 ) ,\ntherefore\nS(t2) = S(t0)e\nR(t1) e\nR(t2 ) ,\nor, equivalently\nS(t2) = S(t0)e\nR(t1)+R (t2) ,\nwhich, by definition, is the cumulative return,\nS(t2) = S(t0)e\nR(t1,t2 ) .\nThis recursive substitution can be repeated any number of periods. Therefore, we are free to write\ni\nR(t0,ti ) = ∑R( )\n\ntk\n(6.3)\nk=1\npage 3\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nand,\nS(ti ) = S(t0) eR(t0,ti ) .\n(6.4)\nWe assume each return is an independently and identically distributed random variable\nfrom a normal distribution with mean m and variance v2:\nR(ti ) = m + v ε~\ni\n(6.5)\nwhere εi is a standard normal random variable. The mean and variance of the period return\ndepend on the size of the period, Δt. In order that the annual return and variance equal μ and σ as\nassumed above, we set m and v as follows:\nm(Δt) = (μ -2 σ )Δt ,\n(6.6)\nv(Δt) = σ Δt .\n(6.7)\nThe rationale for this definition will become clear shortly.\n6.2 Monte Carlo Simulation\nWe can easily simulate this stochastic process. First we need a series of N draws of the\nstandard normal random variables, ε1, ε2, ... εN, which can be readily generated in a standard\nExcel spreadsheet or with any of a number of other mathematical programs. We then calculate the\nN return variables R(t1), R(t2), ... R(tN) using equation (6.5), and then calculate the N cumulative\nreturn variables, R(t0,t1), R(t0,t2), ... R(t0,tN) using equation (6.3) and the N stock price variables,\nS(t1), S(t2), ... S(tN) using equation (6.4). This gives us a sample path for the stock price.\nTable 6.1 shows a sample of the first 10 draws of the standard normal random variable\nand the calculation of returns, cumulative returns and stock prices assuming input parameters\nμ=12% and σ=22% and periods of a week's length, n=52 and Δt=0.0192. For these parameters\nwe have m=0.18% and v=3.05%.\nFigure 6.2 shows how a sample path of the stock price series might appear given three\ndifferent choices for the length of a period--one month, one week and one trading day.\nFigure 6.3 shows 4 different sample paths of the stock price generated by the same\nparameters, but using different sets of draws of the standard normal random variables, ε1, ε2, ...\nεN. Also shown in Figure 6.3 are the corresponding sample paths of cumulative returns.\npage 4\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nIn constructing our simulation, we used the intermediate step of calculating cumulative\nreturns and then stock prices, when it would have been possible to move directly from returns to\nstock prices by applying equation (6.1) recursively. There are a number of reasons why it is\nuseful to construct our simulation and perform much of the analysis in cumulative returns instead\nof directly in terms of stock prices. Once we have constructed the cumulative return at any\nhorizon, it is a simple matter to translate that back into a stock price. One reason for working in\nreturns is that the scale is invariant. In a graph of cumulative returns, a five percentage point\nchange looks the same, regardless of whether it is a five percentage point change from a low\ncumulative return or from a high cumulative return. In a graph of stock prices, a five percentage\npoint change looks smaller if it is a change from a low stock price and looks larger if it is a\nchange from a high stock price. Since stock prices tends to grow exponentially, this tends to\nexaggerate the significance of later returns as compared to earlier returns and distorts our ability\nto grasp the dynamics. Working in returns is also useful in minimizing the impact of the rounding\nerrors that creep into calculations with many periods. The cumulative impact of these errors is\nsmaller if we first sum returns and only exponentiate the cumulative return at the conclusion of\nthe analysis in order to translate the results back into stock prices.\nBy generating repeated paths of the series of returns and stock prices we can produce a\nhistogram of values for the stock price and the cumulative return at any point in time, t∈{t1 ...\nti,... tN}. Figure 6.4 shows a histogram of cumulative returns for a simulation of 100 sample paths\nover a horizon of T=2 years using N=100 periods in total or n=50 per year, with μ=12% and\nσ=22%.\nFor a large enough set of paths, this histogram should approximate the true probability\ndistribution for the process we are simulating, and so can be used to estimate an answer for\ncertain standard types of probability questions. What is the expected cumulative return to T=2? In\nthis small sample, the mean cumulative return at T=2 is 21.2%. What is the standard deviation of\ncumulative returns at T=2? The sample standard deviation is 28.1%. What is the probability that\nthe stock price at 2 years is greater than $90? In our small sample, 86% of the paths end with a\nstock price greater than $90 at T=2. What is the expected stock price at T=2, given that it is\ngreater than $90? In our sample, the average stock price at T=2 among those paths for which the\nprice is greater than $90, is $136.62. What is the probability that between t=0 and t=T the price is\nalways above $90 within the 2 year horizon? In our sample, 46% of the paths are always above\npage 5\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\n$90 throughout the entire window. As tedious as these types of calculations are, they are\nnevertheless readily doable with a computer.\nObviously, the accuracy of our estimated answers to these questions depends upon the\nsize of the sample we take. A sample of 100 is useful for getting an initial feel for a problem, but\nis far too small for reliable results on any interesting questions. It is common to see results\npresented using a sample size of 10,000 runs, but there is nothing sacrosanct about this number.\nThe right sample needed depends upon the degree of accuracy required and the particular\nfunction being estimated. The accuracy also depends on other elements of the simulation. For\nexample, the formula and procedure used to generate the random number can affect the accuracy.\nAlso, it should be clear that simply reproducing the distribution in the way we have described--\nsimple sampling--is a sort of brute force technique. A number of techniques have been\ndeveloped to deliberately select a sample that most efficiently reflects the properties of the\nunderlying distribution, i.e., using the smallest sample size. See, for example, Latin hypercube\nsampling or orthogonal sampling. These techniques will not be explored in any more detail here.\nMore important than the size or technique of sampling, of course, is the question of\nwhether the mathematical model we are using is the right one and whether the parameter values\nwe have selected are right. As always, we are subject to the dictum 'garbage in, garbage out.'\n6.3 The Normal Distribution of Returns\nEarlier we assumed that each period's return was normally distributed and that each\nperiod's return was independently and identically distributed. This will give us a simple\nexpression for the probability distribution of returns at every horizon, which in turn will enable us\nto derive explicit formulas for the types of questions we had asked earlier, questions about the\nlikely and conditional values of the stock price and returns.\nThe sum of a set of normal random variables is itself normally distributed. Because the\nreturns each period are independently distributed, the mean of the sum is the sum of the means.\nAnd because they are identically distributed, the sum of the mean returns is simply proportional\nto the number of periods, i, or elapsed time, ti:\n[ (\n)] = E⎡\ni\nR t ⎤=\ni\nE[R( )\nt ]=\ni\nm = mi\nE R t0,t\n( )\n.\ni\n⎢∑\nk ⎥∑\nk\n∑\n⎣k=1\n⎦\nk=1\nk=1\npage 6\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nNoting that the mean return in a single period, m, is actually a function of the length of the period,\nm(Δt), we can rewrite this as\nE R t0,ti\n(\n(\n.\n(6.8)\n[ (\n)]= m(Δt)i = μ - σ )Δti = μ -2 σ )ti\nThe assumption of independently distributed returns also implies that the variance of the\nsum of returns is equal to the sum of the variances of the returns. And since the returns are\nidentically distributed, the variance of the sum of returns is also linear in the number of periods, i,\nor elapsed time, ti:\n[ (\n)] = Var⎡\ni\nR t ⎤=\ni\nVar[R( )\nt\n=\ni\nv = v i\nVar R t0,ti\n⎢∑( )\nk ⎥∑\nk ] ∑\n.\n⎣k=1\n⎦\nk=1\nk=1\nNoting that the standard deviation of the return in a single period, v, is actually a function of the\nlength of the period, v(Δt), we can rewrite this as\n[ (\n)]= v(Δt) i = σ Δti\nVar R t0,ti\n= σ\n2 ti .\n(6.9)\nTherefore, the cumulative return from period 0 to period i is normally distributed, with mean mi\nand variance vi2:\nR(t0,ti) ~ N(mi,v2i),\nor, equivalently, the cumulative return from period 0 to period i is normally distributed, with\nmean (μ-1⁄2σ2)t and variance σ2t:\nR(\n)\nt0,ti ~ N((μ -2 σ )ti ,σ ti ).\nThe top panel of Figure 6.5 shows the probability distribution of cumulative returns over\na horizon of T=2 years with μ=12% and σ=22%. It should be compared against the histogram of\nreturns shown in Figure 6.4. The mean of the distribution is a return of 19.2%. This should be\ncompared against the mean in the sample which was 21.2%. The difference between those two\nvalues reflects the error we get because our small sample turns out not to be wholly representative\nof the full distribution. The larger the sample size the smaller this error is likely to be. The\nstandard deviation of the distribution shown in Figure 6.5 is 31.1%. This should be compared\nagainst the standard deviation of the sample which was 28.1%.\npage 7\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nThe top panel of Figure 6.6 shows the expected cumulative return at each horizon using\nequation (6.8). Also shown are the one standard deviation confidence bounds which correspond\nto the 68% confidence interval using these equations:\nUR(t0,ti) = (μ - 2 σ\n2)ti + σ ti\n(6.10)\nLR(t0,ti) = (μ - 2 σ\n2)ti -σ ti .\n(6.11)\nOne can see in the figure as well as in equation (6.8) that the expected cumulative return grows\nlinearly in time. One can see in equation (6.9) that the variance of return also grows linearly in\ntime. This means that the standard deviation or volatility of return grows as the square root of\ntime, and one sees this in the shape of the confidence bounds graphed in Figure 6.6 and in the\nform of equations (6.10) and (6.11).\n6.4 The Lognormal Distribution of Prices\nThe expected value and variance of the stock price variable is slightly more complicated\nsince the stock price is equal to the exponentiated return. Rewriting the relationship between the\nstock price and returns shown in equation (6.2) we have\nln(S(ti )) = ln(S(ti-1)) + R(ti )\n~\n= ln(S(ti-1)) + m + vε i .\n(6.12)\nSince the return is a normally distributed random variable, equation (6.12) implies that\nthe log of the price is normally distributed. In that case, the price itself is lognormally distributed:\nS(ti) ~ Log-N (ln(S(ti-1) + m,v\n2 ),\nor, alternatively,\nS(ti) ~ Log-N (ln(S(t0) + (μ - 2 σ )ti ,σ ti ).\nThe bottom panel of Figure 6.5 shows a lognormal distribution. Contrast the normal\ndistribution of cumulative returns shown in the top panel of Figure 6.5 with the lognormal\ndistribution of prices. A lognormally distributed random variable can never go below zero, which\nis an appropriate feature for a distribution describing stock prices. But this contributes to the fact\nthat the lognormal is not a symmetric distribution. It is skewed to the left, with a long upper tail.\nConsequently, the median of the distribution will lie to the left of the mean, which is an important\npage 8\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nproperty in understanding the relationship between expected returns and expected prices. The\nmean return in the top panel is also the median return. Looking back at the bottom panel of Figure\n6.3, the histogram of stock prices from our Monte Carlo simulation, you can see the features of a\nlognormal distribution there, too, and you can contrast these with the features of the normal\ndistribution in the histogram of stock returns immediately above it.\nStanding at t0, the expected value of the stock price at t1, S(t1), is given by:\nE(S(t1)) = S(t0) e\nm+ 1v2\n.\nNote that the volatility parameter, v, enters into the expectation, increasing the expected\nvalue. Consequently, the expected stock price is greater than the price corresponding to the\nexpected return:\nE(S(t1)) = S(t0) e\nm+ 1\n2v2\n> S(t0) e\nm = S(t0) e\nE ( R(t1)) .\nThis is because the variance component of the return makes its own contribution to the expected\nstock price:\nE(S(t1)) = E(S(t0)e\nR(t1) ) = E(S(t0) e\nm+vε~1 ) = S(t0) e\nm E(e\nvε~i ).\nAlthough the mean of the random term ε1 is zero, the expected value of the exponentiated random\nterm is not zero:\nvε~1\n2v\nE(e )= e\n1 2\n.\nThe expected stock price through time is therefore given by\n⎜m+ v ⎟i\n⎝\n⎠\nE(S(ti )) = S(t0) e\n⎛\n1 2 ⎞\n.\nNoting that the mean return in a single period, m, is actually a function of the length of the period,\nm(Δt), we can rewrite this as\n⎝\n⎠\nμ ti\nE(S(ti )) = S(t0) e\n⎜⎛ μ- 1σ 2+ 1σ 2 ⎟⎞ti = S(t0) e .\n(6.13)\nOur earlier choice of parameterization for the per period mean return, writing\nm(Δt) = (μ - σ )Δt , allowed us here, in calculating the mean price, to cancel the terms where\nthe volatility enters and obtain an expression exclusively in terms of the single parameter, μ.\npage 9\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nThe bottom panel of Figure 6.6 graphs the expected stock price through time from\nequation (6.13). Also graphed is the median stock price, which is the price corresponding to the\nmedian return given in equation (6.8):\n⎛\n-\n⎞\n⎝\n⎠\nS(t0) e\n⎜μ 1σ 2 ⎟ti .\n(6.14)\nThe median stock price is always less than the mean stock price. Finally, the bottom panel of\nFigure 6.5 also graphs the upper and lower bounds on the 68% forecast confidence interval for\nthe stock price. These are calculated by exponentiating the upper and lower bounds confidence\ninterval for returns in equations (6.10) and (6.11):\nUS(ti ) = S(t0)e\nUR(t0,ti ) , and\n(6.15)\nLS(ti ) = S(t0)e\nLR (t0,ti ) .\n(6.16)\n6.5 Probability Calculations\nEarlier, we used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate answers to questions such as, what is\nthe probability that the stock price at T=2 is greater than $90? Monte Carlo simulation is a very\nempirical way to approach this question, but one that requires the brute force of many\ncalculations to implement. Because we now have a convenient characterization of the distribution\nof prices at every horizon, we can directly derive the precise answer to this question without\ngoing through the full simulation process. We start by noting that S(ti)>X exactly when\nln(S(ti))>ln(X), so that:\nPr(S(ti ) > X ) = Pr(ln(S(ti )) > ln(X ))\nSince ln(S(ti) is normally distributed, if we subtract the mean and divide by the standard\ndeviation, we will transform it to a standard normal random variable for which the relevant\nprobabilities are readily to hand. Doing this to both sides of the expression inside the probability\nfunction gives us:\nln(S(ti ))\n(\n\nS(t ) -μ -σ )t\nln X -ln S t )-(\n-\n⎛\n-ln\n0 ) (\ni\n( ) ( ( 0)\nμ\n2 σ 2 )ti ⎞\n= Pr⎜⎜⎝\nσ\nti\n>\nσ\nti\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n= Pr\n⎛⎜⎜z > ln( ) (\nX -ln S(t0))-(μ -1\n2 σ 2 )ti ⎞⎟,\n⎝\nσ\nti\n⎟⎠\npage 10\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nwhere z is a standard normally distributed random variable. Taking advantage of symmetry\naround zero in the standard normal distribution, we can rewrite this as\nln( ) (\n-ln S t )-(μ -σ )t\n= Pr⎜⎜\n⎛\n⎝\nz < -\nX\n(\nσ\n0)\nti\ni\n⎟⎟⎞\n⎠\nln( ( ))\n( )\nln X +(\n-σ ) ⎞\n= Pr⎜⎛\nz <\nS t0 -\nμ\n2 ti ⎟\n⎜\nσ ti\n⎟⎠\n⎝\n= N\n⎛⎜ (S(t ))\n( )\nln\n+(\n-1\n2 σ 2 )t ⎞⎟,\nln\n0 -\nX\nμ\ni\n⎜\nσ\nti\n⎟⎠\n⎝\nwhere N( ) is the cumulative normal distribution function. The expression inside the parenthesis is\nof a form that appears in the Black-Scholes equation for the price of a call option. Black-Scholes\nused the variable d2 for this expression. Since our expression is similar, but slightly different, we\nwill use the variable dˆ\n2 :\nˆ\nln(S(t0))-ln(X )+(μ -2 σ )ti\nd2 =\n,\n(6.17)\nσ ti\nso that we have\nPr(S(ti ) > X ) = N (dˆ\n2 ).\n(6.18)\nWe can solve for the complementary probability that the price ends up below the value X,\nPr(S(ti ) < X ) = N (-dˆ\n2 ).\n(6.19)\nWe will come back to analyze the expression for dˆ\n2 in more detail when we come to pricing risk\nand the valuation of a call option. We can evaluate equations 6.18 and 6.19 in Excel using the\nNormSDist function. For our assumed parameters of T=2 years, μ=12% and σ=22%, we have\ndˆ\n2 =0.95447 and we arrive at the solution that Pr(S(ti)>X)= 83%. This should be contrasted with\nthe value of 86% from our Monte Carlo simulation.\nEarlier we had also asked, what is the expected stock price at T=2 given that it is greater\nthan $90? This, too, can be given a precise answer without resort to simulation.\npage 11\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\ninf\ninf\nE[S(ti ) S(ti ) > X ]= ∫S(ti ) f (S(ti )) dS(ti )\n∫f (S(ti )) dS(ti )\nX\nX\n⎛\nX\nμ\n⎞\n= S(t0) eμ ti N⎜ln(S(t0))-ln(\n\n)\n\n+(\n+ 2 σ )ti ⎟ N dˆ\n( )\n⎜\nσ ti\n⎟⎠\n⎝\n= S(t ) eμ ti N (dˆ ) N (dˆ\n2 )\n(6.20)\nwhere,\nˆ\nln(S(t0))-ln(X )+(μ + 2 σ )ti\nˆ\nd1 =\n= d2 +σ ti .\n(6.21)\nσ ti\nThe variable dˆ\n1 is also comparable to the variable d1 which appears in the Black-Scholes\nequation. More on that later. Using equations 6.20 and 6.21, in our numerical example, we have\ndˆ\n1 =1.26559 and the expected stock price at T=2 given that it is greater than $90 is $137.40.\n6.6 Estimating the Parameters\nUntil now, we have assumed a given stochastic process driving the evolution of the stock\nprice, and we have assumed values for the pair of parameters defining that process, μ and σ. Then\nwe have generated probabilistic forecasts of what realization of stock returns and prices we would\nbe likely to see. In reality, neither the process nor the parameters are given. We observe a history\nof past stock returns and prices, and we infer the structure of the process, including the values for\nthe parameters μ and σ.\nFor the moment, we are going to continue with the assumption that we know the general\nstructure of the stochastic process driving returns and prices. However, we are going to\nacknowledge that we do not necessarily know the values for the parameters μ and σ. How do we\nestimate the parameters μ and σ from a history of stock price data?\nOne of the attractive things about the stochastic process model we have been using is that\nthe estimation of the two parameters is very simple. Given a sample of N+1 stock price variables,\nS(t0), S(t1), S(t2), ... S(tN) we first calculate the sequence of N return variables R(t1), R(t2), ...\nR(tN), where R(ti)=ln(S(ti))/ln(S(ti-1)). Now we recall that the per period expected return is m, and\npage 12\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nthe volatility in per period returns is v. Estimates for m and v are simply the sample mean return\nand sample standard deviation of returns:\nN\nˆ\n∑R ti\nm = Mean = R =\n( ) N ,\n(6.22)\ni=1\nN\n∑( ( ) )\nvˆ = StDev =\nR ti -R\n2 (N -1) .\n(6.23)\ni=1\nRecalling that these estimators have been calculated from returns calculated over periods of\nlength Δt=1/n, whereas the parameters μ and σ are denominated as annual values, we need to\nannualize the results by multiplying times the number of periods. In addition, we have to take\ncare to adjust the mean return estimator with one-half the variance:\nμˆ = (mˆ + 1\n2 σˆ\n2) n ,\n(6.24)\nσˆ =vˆ n .\n(6.25)\nTable 6.2 shows the estimation of μ and σ based on a short sample of observed stock\nprices. Because the sample is so short, both estimates have significant error. A larger number of\nobservations is obviously required.\nThere are two ways to obtain a larger number of observations: (i) observe the price more\nfrequently, increasing n and decreasing the length of a period, Δt, while keeping the horizon, T,\nconstant, or (ii) extend the horizon, T, keeping the length of a period, Δt, constant. Increasing the\nfrequently of observations, increasing n, and decreasing the length of a period, Δt, improves the\nprecision of the estimate of volatility, but does not improve the precision of the estimate of drift.\nExtending the horizon improves the precision of the estimate of both drift and volatility, but it\nimproves the precision of drift most. Nevertheless, a good estimate of the drift generally takes a\nvery long horizon of data.\nAn intuitive way to understand why increasing the frequency of observations improves\nthe precision of the estimate of volatility, but not of drift, and to understand why increasing the\nhorizon is most useful for improving the estimate of drift is to examine the portion of a single\nperiod's return determined by each: Look at the ratio of the standard deviation of the return in a\nperiod, v(Δt) to the mean return:\npage 13\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nv(Δt)\nσ Δt\nσ\nx =\n=\nm(Δt) (μ - 1\n2 σ 2 )Δt = (μ - 1\n2 σ 2 )\n.\nΔt\nAs the length of the period becomes very short, with Δt approaching zero, this ratio goes to\ninfinity. This means that what we observe in a very, very short period reflects volatility. As the\nlength of the period grows, with Δt approaching infinity, this ratio goes to zero, so that the\nmajority of what we are observing reflects the drift. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to get to\ninfinity, so it is difficult to get the information that we would like on the drift. It is much easier to\nmake more frequent observations and improve our estimate of volatility. In theory, greater and\ngreater frequency of observations will eventually give us a perfectly precise estimate of volatility.\nIn practice, there are extra elements of noise in frequent observations - such as bid-ask bounce or\na lack of trading, or simply mis-reporting of data - which put a limit on the value of the extra\nfrequency of observations and a bound on how precise can our estimates of volatility become. We\nabstracted from these extra elements of noise when we structured the assumptions of our model.\n6.7 The Continuous Time Representation\nIn the previous material, we modeled the stock price as a discrete time stochastic process.\nEach year was divided into n periods of length Δt. Suppose we increase the number of periods a\nyear, letting the length of each period get smaller and smaller. If we continue this to the limit, so\nthat Δt is infinitesimally small, then we have a continuous process. We can write the process two\nways. The first is directly in terms of the stock price:\ndS\nS(\n(\nt\nt\n)\n) = μ dt + σ dz ,\n(6.26)\nThe term dS(t) is the continuous time equivalent of the per period change in price, S(ti)-S(ti-1). The\nterm dt is the continuous time equivalent of Δt. The term dz is the continuous time equivalent of\nthe standard normal random variables, εi. However, this simple statement hides the very\ncomplicated mathematical properties embedded in it. The term dz is called the Brownian motion.\nThe key feature of the Brownian motion is that variation in the value of the process are normally\ndistributed with a variance that is proportional to the length of the time period. Although the\nvolatility parameter in equation (6.26) does not, on its face, appear to be multiplied times the\nsquare root of the time period--there is no dt multiplying the σ--this is only because the time\nelement is implicit in the Brownian motion term, dz.\npage 14\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nThis second way to write this process is in terms of the log of the price, i.e., in terms of\nthe returns:\nd ln(S(t)) = (μ - σ )dt + σ dz ,\n(6.27)\nAll of the properties we derived earlier for the discrete time process apply as well to this\ncontinuous time version. Returns are normally distributed, with the mean and variance of the\nreturn proportional to the horizon over which the return is compounded. Stock prices are\nlognormally distributed, and the expected stock price at t is S0 eμ. All of the earlier functions for\nthe expected price and returns, confidence bounds and probability distributions remain valid.\nContinuous time models are very mathematically demanding to develop and manipulate.\nBut the investment often pays off since the mathematics enables development of powerful\ninsights that can be difficult to grasp as readily when working in discrete time. Nevertheless, it is\nbeyond the scope of this book to provide the reader with the tools necessary to work directly in\ncontinuous time. Instead, we simply exploit the continuous time results that have been produced\nand published in the literature, without attempting to derive them here. And we will try to make\nclear the correspondence between a given continuous time model and an alternative discrete time\nrepresentation so that the reader develops the ability to perform as an intelligent consumer of\nfuture results in continuous time mathematics. In general, we will limit ourselves in this book to\nimplementing solutions and simulations using discrete time processes, even where we regularly\nreport on a particular continuous time model.\n6.8 The Binomial and Other Tree or Lattice Representations\nIn this section we present a third way to model the random walk process, made popular\nby one well known binomial version. The general idea is to represent the evolution of the price\nthrough a series of branches in a tree. As with the discrete time stochastic process model, the\nmodel hypothesizes a series of discrete steps that can be specified as longer or shorter time\nintervals. However, at each point in time there are only a finite number of possible outcomes--in\nthe binomial model, unsurprisingly, just two. With a large enough number of steps, the final\ndistribution is very dense, despite the narrow range at each instant.\nUsing a tree structure has a couple of benefits. One is pedagogical. By reducing the\nnumber of possible outcomes at each time, it is possible to describe very simply the key value\npage 15\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nrelationships from period to period. This makes the solutions transparent and easy to understand.\nTherefore the binomial model has become a popular teaching tool.\nSecond, using the tree structure expands the range of valuation problems we can tackle.\nValuation is inherently forward looking and requires understanding the full structure of future\ncontingencies. Current values are calculated by discounting future cash flows. In this sense,\nvaluations starts from the end in time and moves backwards. To know today's value, we first\nneed to know the distribution of possible values at the end of one year and then work backward.\nThe Monte Carlo method works the other ways around. It starts from the current parameter value\nand generates a distribution for later dates. This works well for the single parameter being\nsimulated, for which the governing stochastic process has been exogenously specified. But it\ndoesn't work well for determining the value of assets with cash flows that are tied to that\nunderlying parameter. With a binomial tree, once we know how the underlying parameter value\nevolves along the nodes of the tree, we can also work backwards and calculate the values of an\nasset with cash flows tied to that underlying parameter, and we can then learn how the value of\nthat asset evolves through time.\nFigure 6.7 shows the first step in a binomial tree. The tree begins at t=0 with a single\nnode. The initial price is S0=$10.00. The log price is 2.303. The tree then has two branches\nleading to two nodes, the up node and the down node. The top branch represents the possibility of\na high return, U=31.6%. The new log price is 2.618 and the new price is SU=$13.71. The bottom\nbranch represents the possibility of a low return, -12.4%. The new log price is 2.178 and the new\nprice is SD=$8.83.\nFigure 6.8 shows how the tree branches out from the first step to the second step. From\nthe top node at t=1, the tree again branches twice. The top branch once again represents the\npossibility of a high return, U=31.6%. The new log price is 2.934 and the new price is\nSUU=$18.81. The bottom branch represents the possibility of a low return, -12.4%. The new log\nprice is 2.494 and the new price is SUD=$12.11. From the bottom node at t=1, the tree also\nbranches twice. The top branch once again represents the possibility of a high return, U=31.6%.\nThe new log price is 2.494 and the new price is SDU=$12.11. The bottom branch represents the\npossibility of a low return, -12.4%. The new log price is 2.054 and the new price is SDD=$7.80.\nBecause of the way we selected the returns at each branch, the stock price at the two\ninterior nodes at t=2 are identical: SUD = SDU. Therefore, we can represent the same dynamics in\nthe form of a recombining tree as in Figure 6.10. A recombining tree is computationally\npage 16\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nconvenient since the number of nodes grows linearly with the number of period, whereas in the\nnon-recombining tree the number of nodes grows exponentially. However, there will be cases in\nwhich a recombining tree is not useful since information about the history of returns is lost. More\non this later.\nAt first glance, a binomial tree appears too crude to adequately represent the risk\nstructure we used earlier to model a stock price. But the tree can be expanded to include many\nmore steps, and in that case the final branchings are a very dense representation of the range of\npossible future stock prices. Figure 6.11 shows a recombining binomial tree with N=24 time\nsteps.\nIn the illustrations shown so far, we carefully selected the high and low returns for the\npurpose of generating stock returns that are approximately normally distributed. Figure 6.11\nshows the probability distribution across the final node of the tree. You can see that this\ndistribution is approximately normal. There are several different ways to define the returns and\nprobabilities along the tree so as to assure that the distribution across nodes is approximately\nnormal. In these lecture notes our default method will be to set the up node as one standard\ndeviation above the expected value and the down node as one standard deviation below the\nexpected value.1 The probability of following either path will be 1⁄2. In this example, with μ=9%,\nσ=22%, and Δt=1 we have:\n\nE[ln(S1)] = ln(S0)+(μ-1/2σ2)Δt = 2.398,\nso that\nln(SU)= ln(S0 )+(μ -2 σ )Δt +σ\nΔt = 2.618\nln(SD)= ln(\n)+(\n-σ )Δt -\nS0\nμ\nσ\nΔt = 2.178.\nWe repeat this process at the subsequent nodes. Starting from t=1, at the top node where S1=SU,\nwe have:\n\nE[ln(S2)] = ln(SU)+(μ-1/2σ2)Δt = 2.714,\nso that\n1 This is slightly different from the more well known Cox-Ross-Rubinstein method. For finite length of the period, the\nchoice of method matters. However, as the length of a period decreases and the number of steps per year increases,\nboth methods converge to the normal distribution and calculations done using the two methods yield the same result.\npage 17\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nln(SUU)= ln(SU )+(μ - 2 σ )Δt +σ Δt = 2.934\nln(SUD)= ln(SU )+(μ - 1\n2 σ )Δt -σ Δt = 2.494.\nApplying these steps throughout the tree produces a probability distribution across\nreturns at each date that is approximately normal. As the length of the period, Δt, declines to zero,\nthe distribution approaches the normal distribution. The mean of this distribution of returns grows\nlinearly with the time horizon. The variance of this distribution grows linearly with the time\nhorizon so that the standard deviation grows as the square root of the time horizon. These are the\nsame properties that we derived for our discrete stochastic process and for the continuous time\nstochastic process. The binomial tree is just another tool for representing the same dynamics.\n6.9 Complications\nThe assumption of normality in returns and lognormality in stock prices leads to a very\ntractable and convenient model. This is a valuable property. But does the model fit the data? Are\nstock returns normally distributed? Are stock prices lognormal?\nThe lognormal model has proven very valuable for stock prices. At a certain level of\nprecision, it appears to work very well. However, there appear to be a number of ways in which\nstock prices don't fit the model. One of the most important ones is the observation of fat tails, i.e.\nmore large returns - whether positive or negative - than predicted by the normal distribution.\nHow large of a problem this is depends upon the purposes to which one is employing the model.\nFor large investment funds this is an important detail to consider. We will come back to this issue\nlater in the lecture notes.\nAnother, more implicit assumption we have been making as we developed the model\nabove is that the parameters were stable throughout the horizon we were studying. This need not\nbe the case. In particular, it is widely observed that there are periods of lower and periods of\nhigher volatility. Although it is convenient to develop the model with a constant mean and\nvolatility, it is not necessary that they be constant. Allowing the mean and the volatility to change\nthrough time will certainly complicate our calculations. For example, in the binomial tree, the\nability to have the tree recombine is predicated on this stability in the parameters. If the\nparameters are changing, we can develop a 'fix' to our modeling, but it will require more\nattention and time.\npage 18\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\n6.10 From Factor Risk to Project Risk\nHaving modeled the price of a stock and measured its risk, we now want to analyze the\nrisk of a derivative claim on the stock. The risk of the stock flows through to the derivative claim.\nBut the risk is altered by the nature of the derivative claim. Sometimes the derivative may be\nriskier, and sometimes the derivative may have less risk. The source of the risk is the stock price\nrisk. In that sense, we call the stock price the factor. But the factor risk can be either concentrated\nor diluted by the terms of the derivative claim. And the amount of factor risk channeled through\nto the derivative claim may change with the price of the stock.\nWhile we focus, for the moment, on a derivative claim on a stock, this illustrates a very\ngeneral principle in risk analysis. Project cash flows reflect underlying factors. The key question\nin analyzing project risk is understanding (i) the risk of the factor, and (ii) how that risk is\nchanneled to the project. Going from the underlying factor risk to project risk can be complicated,\nbut it is essential. Analyzing a simple derivative claim on a stock price is a convenient starting\npoint for developing our understanding of this complicated phenomenon.\nWe focus on the risk of a call option. A call option written on a stock gives the option\nholder the right to buy the stock at a fixed price, the exercise price any time up to an including a\nmaturity date. Later we will examine carefully how the price of a call option is determined. For\nthe moment, we will simply take as given that the price of the call is determined by the Black-\nScholes equation:\n-rT\nC = S N(d1 )- K e\nN(d2 ),\nwhere,\nln(S) - ln(K) +(r + 2 σ )T\nd1\n=\n,\nσ T\nln(S) - ln(K) +(r - 2 σ )T\nd2\n= d1 -σ T =\n,\nσ T\nand where,\npage 19\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nC is the price of the call, S is the current price of the stock, K is the exercise price, T is the\nmaturity date, σ is the volatility of the stock, r is the risk free rate of interest, and N( ) is the\ncumulative normal distribution.\nThe top panel of Figure 6.12 shows the graph of the call price as a function of the stock\nprice. For this calculation we have set the exercise price to $50, the maturity to 1 year, the\nvolatility to 30% and the risk-free interest rate to 5%. The key fact to notice is that the graph is\nnot linear. Only as the stock goes deep in-the-money, i.e. the stock price is above the exercise\nprice, does the function become approximately linear. When the stock price is below the exercise\nprice so that the call option is out-of-the-money, the function is very convex. One consequence of\nthis relationship is that the riskiness of the call option changes as the stock price changes. We will\nwrite σoption to denote the volatility of the derived option price, and σstock to denote the volatility of\nthe underlying stock. At very high stock prices, when the option is deep in-the-money, holding\nthe call is virtually identical to holding the stock, so that the risk of the call option equals the risk\nof the stock: σoption ≅σstock. At very low stock price, when the option is far out-of-the-money, the\nrisk of the option grows far above the risk of the stock: σoption > σstock.\nThe formula relating the risk of the option to the risk of the stock is:\nS Δ\nS N(d1 )\nσoption = σstock × |Ω| = σstock\n= σstock\nC\nC\nwhere Ω is the option elasticity and Δ is the option delta, the measure of the change in the option\nprice for a $1 change in the stock price. The bottom panel of Figure 6.13 shows the graph of the\nvolatility of the call price as a function of the stock price. Recall that the volatility of the stock\nprice is constant, regardless of the level of the stock price. At very high stock prices, the volatility\nof the call is almost double the volatility of the stock. As the stock price drops, the volatility of\nthe call price grows, and grows sharply, so that the volatility of a far out-of-the-money option\ngrows to nearly ten times the volatility of the stock.\nThis is a good illustration of how important it is to understand the relationship between\nthe risk of the underlying factor and the risk of the derivative asset. One underlying factor for a\ncommodity producer - a gold mining company, for example - is the price at which it can sell the\ncommodity. If the company will produce the gold regardless of how low the price goes, then its\npayoff will be linear with the gold price. Suppose instead that the company has flexibility to\nrespond to changes in the gold price. Suppose it will shut down some production as the price of\npage 20\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\ngold falls, and if the company owns some mines that it will reopen or potential mines that it will\ndevelop should the gold price rise sharply, then the company's payoff will be non-linear in the\nprice of gold, and the company's risk will change as the gold price changes just as the call option\nrisk changes as the stock price changes.\n6.11 Application of the Random Walk to Other Variables\nThe use of stochastic processes in the field of finance was pioneered through the\ndevelopment of the geometric Brownian motion model applied to stocks. As the power of this\ntool became clear, it also occurred to many analysts that this tool could be applied to modeling\nmany other variables. Unfortunately, the widespread application of this model to other variables\nreflected the adage, \"when the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" In\nthe following section, we will discuss alternative stochastic processes and their application to\nmodeling appropriately selected variables. Nevertheless, there are some variables where this\nsimple model has, perhaps, been usefully applied.\nOne such case is the price of gold. This is because gold is used as an investment vehicle,\nand because the cost of storing gold is relatively small. For example, in analyzing the hedging\nstrategies of gold companies, Fehle and Tysplakov (2005) model the gold price based on data\nfrom 1992-2000 setting the mean annual return at 2% and the annual volatility at 10%.2\nd'Halluin et al. (2003) examine how to determine when to expand bandwidth capacity on\na wireless network when the growth in traffic is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion.3\nThe random walk model is a very specialized process with particular properties that make\nit attractive for modeling stock prices. One such feature is the property that the uncertainty about\nfuture stock price grows without bound. There is no maximum beyond which the price is certain\nnot to go.\nA second key feature of this model is that changes in the current spot price translate one-\nfor-one into a permanent revision of the forecast of future prices. There is no such thing as a\ntemporary shock to the stock price, i.e., a shock in which the stock price goes up and then\npredictably comes down again.\n2 Fehle, F. and S. Tysplakov, (2005), Dynamic risk management: Theory and evidence, Journal of Financial\nEconomics 78, 3-47.\n3 d'Halluin, Y., P.A. Forsyth, and K.R. Vetzal, 2003, \"Wireless Network Capacity Investment,\" Working Paper.\npage 21\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\nThe two panels of Figure 6.13 illustrate this second key feature, the permanent impact of\nany shock in a random walk process. The top panel shows a historic sample of data for a price\nseries. The price has recently experienced a sharp run-up. If we were to forecast the future path of\nthe price using the random walk model, our forecast would follow the nearly straight line heading\nto the right and slightly upward. This line reflects the expected rate of growth in the price, μ. The\nforecast takes off from wherever is the most recent value. Any further run-up in the price above\nthe expected growth rate will shift the whole forecast line up, at all horizons. This is the sense in\nwhich any shock or innovation to the price is treated as a permanent shock.\nThe bottom panel of Figure 6.13 shows the same historic price data, but constructs a\nforecast of future prices by applying a different model, the mean reverting model. The mean is\nshown as a dashed line running through the historic data and continuing out into the future time.\nThe most recent run-up in the historic price series has sent the price far above the mean. In the\nmean reverting model, we expect the price to return back to the mean. The forecast is shown as\nthe curved line heading down from the most recent historic price towards the mean and ultimately\nasymptoting to the mean. The mean price is growing at a rate μ, but the actual price is forecasted\nto be declining until it returns close enough back to the mean. Therefore, the recent run-up in\nprice is viewed exclusively as a temporary shock. The long-run forecast is entirely unaffected by\nthe shock. Only the short-run forecast is dragged upward.\nThis property of the random walk makes the model very easy to handle. Not only are the\nforecasted distributions normal variables, but because of this \"permanent shock\" property, the\nconditional distribution always have the same structure, no matter the current value of the\nvariable. This makes working with the data and estimating the parameters very simple. There are\nnever any complicated adjustments to be made. In a mean-reverting model, the conditional\ndistributions are changing depending upon the current value of the variable. This makes working\nwith the data and estimating parameters more difficult since adjustments have to be made to\ncompensate or reflect these changing conditional distributions.\nWe can illustrate the difference with the simple example of reporting volatility on an\nannualized basis. Suppose we measure returns using weekly data and calculate a weekly\nvolatility. The annualized volatility is calculated by taking the weekly volatility and multiplying\nby the square root of 52. This makes sense with the random walk because the volatility grows by\nthe square root of time, and the volatility in the process never changes. The annualized weekly\nvolatility should roughly match what you would get if you calculated the volatility from annual\npage 22\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic Models\ndata. But the same is not true with a mean reverting process. Annualizing the weekly volatility by\nmultiplying it by the square root of 52 will produce a number that is larger than what you would\nget if you calculated the annual volatility from annual data. With a mean reverting process, one\nneeds to take more care in this type of reporting and comparison.\nUnfortunately, the 'permanent shock' property is exactly what makes the random walk\nmodel unattractive for representing the dynamics of many other variables that determine project\ncash flows and values. These factors include interest rates, foreign exchange rates, various\ncommodity prices such as oil, natural gas and electricity, and many others. Many of these other\nfactors exhibit more complicated conditional forecasts. Many exhibit mean reversion of one form\nor another, for example. In most cases it is a mistake to casually move from returns and volatility\nmeasured and denominated over one interval of time to returns and volatility measured and\ndenominated over another interval. So it is necessary to develop other models appropriate to the\npeculiar dynamics of these other, underlying factors central to asset valuation and management.\nHaving already alluded to the properties of a mean reverting process, it is now time to\nformally present one. The next part of this chapter develops the pure mean reverting process and\nshows how it is used to model interest rates. The final part of the chapter gives a brief overview\nof other processes that are used to model a wide range of commodity prices and other factors.\npage 23\n\nChapter 6: Measuring Risk--Dynamic

Parsons and Antonio S. Mello\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nCorporate managers price risk all the time when they discount a cash flow to its present\nvalue using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Future cash flows are discounted not only to account for\nthe time value of money, but also to account for risk. Starting from the risk-free discount rate,\nextra risk is accounted for by adding a risk premium to arrive at a risk-adjusted discount rate. The\ndiscounted cash flow methodology using a risk-adjusted discount rate is the workhorse of\ncorporate finance. And for many problems it is a perfectly adequate tool. But it has its limits.\nSome projects and securities have complicated risk dynamics for which the traditional risk-\nadjusted discount rate methodology is not flexible enough to do the trick with the ease and power\nwe demand. Modern business and modern financial management is able to slice-up and repackage\nrisk to create novel contingent cash flow patterns for which the usual application of the risk-\nadjusted discount rate methodology is error prone.\nAs it is usually implemented, the risk-adjusted discount rate methodology rests on two\nkey assumptions that often do not apply. First, the risky cash flows being discounted are perfectly\nproportional to the underlying risk variable. One way to think about this is that the risky cash\nflows are symmetrically distributed, with an upside and a downside in equal proportion. This\nassumption is violated, for example, in the case of a call option, where the downside is truncated.\nSecond, the risk in the cash flows grows linearly through time. This assumption is violated, for\nexample, when much of the uncertainty in a project is resolved up front in early stages, although\nthe results, whether good or bad, are payed out over a long period of time. This assumption is also\nviolated whenever a key risk factor is not a random walk, but reverts to a mean or has other\nfeatures that create a changing risk distribution at various horizons.\nMany introductory corporate finance textbooks mention these exceptions to the usual\ndiscounting rules and construct a couple of simple examples to demonstrate how the usual\napplication of the methodology produces a mistake. But for reasons of space and focus, they do\nnot provide an adequate treatment of the solution. Many corporate managers, in the course of\ntheir careers, stumble upon actual projects or problems where the traditional risk-adjusted\ndiscount methodology seems inappropriate for these very reasons, whether or not they can\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\narticulate it this way. It is the task of this chapter to introduce and develop an alternative, robust\nrisk pricing methodology capable of handling the wide array of complicated and dynamic patterns\nof risk that corporate managers often face. Ironically, this alternative methodology is widely\nknown as the risk-neutral pricing methodology. Despite the unfortunate moniker, this alternative\nmethodollogy has gained prominence among investment bankers, commodity traders and risk\nmanagers because of its power and adaptability. So corporate managers can expect to see a good\nbit more of it in the coming years. Corporate managers who wish to develop a facility to expertly\nprice and manage risk need to be familiar with this second valuation methodology.\nThis chapter is your introduction. Before presenting the risk-neutral methodology proper,\nwe first make a brief digression to remind the student that the risk-adjusted discount rate\nmethodology has never been the only methodology available. We do this with an example\nsketched out in the next section.\n9.1 Two Alternative Methods for Discounting Cash Flows\nThe Hejira oil company is estimating the present value of the next five years of oil\nrevenue. The top panel of Table 9.1 shows the forecasted production, forecasted spot oil price, the\nrisk-free discount rate, and the oil price risk premium for these five years.\nTwo different methods can be employed to calculate the present value:\n-\nthe risk-adjusted discount rate method, and\n-\nthe certainty-equivalent method.\nThe top panel of Table 9.1 also shows the calculation of the present value using the risk-\nadjusted discount rate method. This is the traditional and familiar method for calculating a present\nvalue. In this method, the two tasks of (i) accounting for the time value of money and (ii)\naccounting for the price of risk are accomplished in a single step by applying a single risk-\nadjusted discount rate to the expected cash flow. This single risk-adjusted discount rate reflects\nboth the time value of money and the price of risk. The risk-adjusted discount rate is the sum of\nthe risk-free rate and a risk premium appropriate to a stream of revenue tied to the price of oil:\nra = rf+λ.\n(9.1)\nWe call this risk premium, λ, the market price of risk for cash flows tied to the oil price, or the oil\nfactor risk premium.\npage 2\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nThe bottom panel of Table 9.1 shows the calculation of the present value using the\ncertainty equivalent method. This is a less familiar, but no less correct method. In this method, the\naccounting for the price of risk and for the time value of money are performed in two separate\nsteps. First, the expected cash flow is adjusted to account for the price of risk, λ. Second, the\ncertainty-equivalent cash flow is then discounted to account for the time value of money. Because\nthe cash flow being discounted has already been adjusted to account for risk, this step uses the\nrisk-free discount rate.\nThe present values of each year's cash flow are identical under the two methods. Figure\n9.1 captures the point that these are two different routes to the exact same end. In the numerical\nexample shown in Table 9.1 it is obvious that the result must be the same. The risk-adjusted\ndiscount rate is just equal to the sum of the risk-free rate and the risk premium, so using the risk-\nadjusted discount methodology is just literally putting together the two separate steps of the\ncertainty-equivalent method. The result has to be the same whichever method is used. The two\nmethods accomplish the same thing, using a slightly different sequence of steps. Figure 9.1\ncaptures the relationship between these two methodologies.\nIf the two methods are trivially the same, as this numerical example suggests, then what\nis the point of making a distinction between them? Separating the risk-premium from the risk-free\nrate allows us to handle the evolution of risk through time separately from the discounting of\ntime. This is what turns out to be critical. We have already seen that the risk of various factors\nmay vary over time, and that the risk on an asset may vary as the factor grows or falls. It is the\ndynamic and contingent nature of risk that forces us to resort to the second methodology. When\nfactor risk falls through time, we will need to adjust our discount for risk downward. But the\ndiscount for time remains as before. Having separated the risk-premium from the risk-free rate,\nwe can adjust the one without adjusting the other. When the project risk varies as the factor\ngrows, we need to adjust our discount for risk accordingly. But the discount for time remains as\nbefore.\nIt is this greater flexibility in the face of dynamically changing risk structures that gives\nthe risk-neutral methodology its advantage. The risk-adjusted discount rate method remains by far\nthe most familiar method to corporate managers and to investment bankers involved in the\npurchase and sale of corporate assets and the evaluation of major capital investments. However,\nthe risk-neutral methodology has become very important to specialists involved in valuing and\ntrading derivatives and in evaluating risk management strategies. In addition to the flexibility this\npage 3\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nmethod offers, understanding the risk-neutral method is important for reading the information\ncoded into many market prices.\n9.2 Risk Neutral Pricing - an Introduction\nIn Chapter 6 we learned that the uncertain evolution of a variable could be modeled\nseveral different ways--as a discrete stochastic process, as a continuous stochastic process, using\nbinomial or other trees, etc. In this section, we start our introduction to the price of risk using the\nbinomial model. Later, based on an analysis developed on branches of the binomial tree, we will\nexplain how this ties back to an analysis using the other representations, such as the discrete or\nthe continuous stochastic process.\nState Prices\nFigure 9.2 shows a single branching of our underlying risk factor, S. Also shown in\nFigure 9.2 is an associated project with cash flows contingent on the evolution of S. The variable\nCFU is the cash flow earned if the underlying risk factor moves up to SU. The variable CFD is the\ncash flow earned if the underlying risk factor moves down to SD. The variable VP is the market\nvalue of the project with a claim to these two contingent cash flows, and no other claim. Let us\nassume the following information:\nCFU = $13.04\nCFD = $8.40\nVP = $10.00\nFor the moment, we also assume\nπU = 50%\nπD = 50%,\nalthough later we will revisit this. Finally, we assume that:\nrf = 4%.\nGiven the market price of the project, we can back out an appropriate risk-adjusted\ndiscount rate using the classic discounted cash flow formula:\nVP = E[CF ] e-ra = (CFU ×πU + CFD ×π D ) e\n-(rf +λP ).\n(9.2)\npage 4\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nInputting the relevant values gives us:\nra = 7%,\nwhich also implies:\nλP = 3%.\nWe use the subscript P to denote that this is the risk premium appropriate for the project shown in\nFigure 9.2.\nFigure 9.3 shows two derivatives of the project. One of the derivatives earns the cash\nflow CFU if the underlying risk factor moves up to SU, but earns nothing if the underlying risk\nfactor moves down to SD. The other derivative earns the cash flow CFD if the underlying risk\nfactor moves down to SD, but earns nothing if the underlying risk factor moves up to SD. Also\nshown in Figure 9.3 is the payoff structure for a riskless bond earning $1 regardless of whether\nthe underlying risk factor moves up to SU or down to SD. Valuing the bond is easy, assuming that\nwe know the risk-free rate of interest, rf. Can we value the two derivatives?\nIt is tempting to value the derivatives using the risk-adjusted discount rate of the project,\nbut, as we will see shortly, this would be wrong:\nE[CF ] e-ra = (CFU ×πU ) e-ra = VU,\nand,\nE[CF ] e-ra = (CFD ×π D ) e-ra = VD.\nThe risk-premium that should be applied to the derivative VU is larger than the project risk-\npremium, so that the correct value is less than what one would get applying the project risk-\npremium. The risk-premium that should be applied to the derivative VD is smaller than the project\nrisk-premium, so that the correct value is greater than what one would get applying the project\nrisk-premium. How do we know this?\nWhen we analyzed the market price of the original project, we backed out a risk-\npremium, λP, that we applied to the expected cash flow of the project. In fact, the market price of\nthe original project gives us more information than simply the risk premium to apply to the\nexpected cash flow. It actually gives us two risk adjustment factors, one to be applied to the up\ncash flow, CFU, and one to be applied to the down cash flow, CFD. Applying the project risk-\npremium to both cash flows makes these two risk adjustment factors equal. But it makes no sense\npage 5\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nthat the two risk adjustment factors should be equal. Under most sensible models of risk and\nvalue, cash earned in the down state should capture a premium, while cash in the up state is what\nshould be discounted. Cash in the down state is like insurance, and it is prized. The project risk\npremium, λP, is an average of the discount applied to the up state and the premium paid for the\ndown state cash flow. It works when we are receiving the complete package. But when we are\nvaluing just one cash flow or the other, we need to apply the right risk adjustment factor for that\ncash flow, not the average. Here's how to extract that information from the value of the project.\nWe use the terminology \"forward state prices\" to describe the two variables φU and φD.1\nWe define the forward state prices as the solution to the following two equations:\nB = ($1×πU ×φU + $1×π D ×φD ) e\n-rf\n(9.3)\nVP = (CFU ×πU ×φU + CFD ×π D ×φD ) e\n-rf .\n(9.4)\nSolving these two equations gives us:\n⎛V e\nrf -CFD ⎞ 1\nφU =\n⎝⎜⎜\nCFU - CFD ⎠⎟⎟\nπU\n= 0.866\n(9.5)\n1-πU φU\nφD =\n= 1.134.\n(9.6)\n1-πU\nHaving derived these forward state prices, we can now go back to value the two\nderivative claims, VU and VD:\nVU = (CFU ×πU ×φU ) e\n-rf = $5.42\nVD = (CFU ×πU ×φU + CFD ×π D ×φD ) e\n-rf = $4.58.\nNow we can go back and confirm what we had said earlier about the risk-premium that\nshould be applied to the derivative VU being larger than the project risk-premium, and the risk-\npremium that should be applied to the derivative VD being smaller than the project risk-premium.\nThe risk premiums implied by our valuation are:\n1 Some students may be familiar with the term \"state price\", which is a fundamental concept in the economics of\nuncertainty originally developed by Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu. An Arrow-Debreu state price is the present\nvalue of $1 in a future state, which is a discounted value. Our forward state price is the undiscounted value. The state\nprice and the forward state price differ only by the riskless rate of interest.\npage 6\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nλU solves VU = (CFU ×πU ) e-λU e\n-rf ,\n(9.7)\nwhich gives us:\nr\n⎛(VU e\nf ) ⎞\n⎛ $5.42 e4% ⎞\nλU = - ln ⎜⎜CF π\n⎟⎟= - ln⎜⎜\n$13.04 1 ⎟⎟ = 14.4%,\n⎝\nU\nU ⎠\n⎝\n2 ⎠\nand,\nλD solves VD = (CFD ×π D ) e-λD e\n-rf ,\n(9.8)\nwhich gives us:\nrf\n4%\n⎛(V e ) ⎞\n⎛ $4.58e\n⎞\nλD = - ln⎜⎜\nCF\nD\nπ\n⎟⎟= - ln⎜⎜\n$8.40 1 ⎟⎟ = -12.6%.\n⎝\nD\nD ⎠\n⎝\n2 ⎠\nThe risk premium λU is, as expected, significantly higher than the project risk premium of 3%.\nThe risk premium λD is negative! This fits with our earlier discussion in which we pointed out\nthat receiving cash flows in the down state is a type of insurance policy for which a person is\nwilling to pay a premium instead of charging a discount. Although the expected cash flow is\n$4.20, the value of the claim to the cash flow is $4.58.\nPaying a premium for insurance against the bad states is a natural feature of all asset\npricing models. It is only a surprise to students who are used to estimating risk premia only for\ntypical projects, as opposed to the wide range of risk premia one finds on various derivative\nprojects including derivatives that pay-off primarily in down states. This is a good example of\nwhere the traditional risk-adjusted discount rate methodology invites error in the face of specially\npackaged cash flow patters, while the risk-neutral methodology gets it right as a matter of course.\nIndeed, it is the advantage of using state prices that one can readily and easily value\npackages of cash flows with any structure that is derivative of the underlying state variable. This\nis the key to this methodology's growing acceptance. Once we have backed out the two forward\nstate prices from the market value of a bond and of a project, valuing many other projects with\ndifferent cash flow patterns is simple.\nFor example, suppose we borrow $5 to invest in the project. We will call this the levered\nproject and denote it's value as VLP. The net cash flow on the upside is CFLU=$7.84, which is the\npage 7\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\noriginal cash flow less the debt repayment at the risk-free rate of interest. The net cash flow on\nthe downside is CFLD=$3.20. The value of the levered project is calculated as:\nVLP = (CFLU ×πU ×φU + CFLD ×π D ×φD ) e-ra = $5.00.\nThe implicit risk premium on the levered project is:\nλLP solves VLP = (CFLU ×πU + CFLD ×π D ) e-λLP e-ra ,\nwhich gives us:\nrf\n4%\n⎛\n(VLU e )\n⎞\n⎛\n$5.00 e\n⎞\nλLP = - ln\n⎝⎜⎜\nCFLU πU + CFLD π D ⎠⎟⎟ = - ln\n⎝⎜⎜\n$7.84 1\n2 + $3.20 1\n2 ⎠⎟⎟ = 5.8%.\nThe Risk Neutral Distribution\nAt the top of the previous section, we made an explicit assumption about the probability\nthat the underlying factor, S, would move up or down. That assumption was unnecessary. In the\nseries of steps proceeding from the given values of a bond and a project to the derived values of\nthe derivatives, the expressions for the forward state prices are always accompanied by the\nexpression for the probability. Because we assumed a given probability, we could solve for the\nforward state price. Had we assumed a different pair of probabilities, we would have calculated a\ndifferent pair of forward state prices. But we would NOT have calculated different values for the\ntwo derivative assets! No matter what derivative asset we consider, the calculated value is\ninvariant to changes in the assumed probability.\nLet's confirm that by changing the probabilities and recalculating the results. The first\ncolumn of Table 9.2 shows the earlier calculations. At the top are the inputs: the cash flows if the\nfactor goes up or down, the market price of the project, the probabilities of the factor going up or\ndown, and the risk-free interest rate. At the bottom of the column are three sets of outputs. The\nfirst outputs are the two forward state prices. We also record the product of the probability and\nthe forward state price. The second outputs are the values for the derivative assets. The third\noutputs are the risk-premium implied for the project by its market value and the risk-premia\nimplied by the calculated market values of the derivative assets.\nThe second column of Table 9.2 show what happens when we change the assumed\nprobabilities. We keep the cash flows in each state the same as before, and keep the market value\nof the original project the same. We then recalculate the forward state prices, the values of the\npage 8\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nderivative assets and the implied risk premia for the two derivatives. Notice that the calculated\nvalues for the derivative assets do NOT change!\nTake note that the calculated forward state prices do change. So do the implied risk\npremia for the various derivative assets, including the original project. What matters for valuation\nis the product of the probability and the forward state price. Looking across our two columns one\ncan see that this product is the same. If we change the assumed probability, we change the\ncalculated forward state price, but just so much as to keep the product constant. That is why our\noriginal assumption about the probabilities was an unnecessary one.\nThis is an important concept to grasp. What is going on here is that we started from a\ngiven market value for the project. The market value is already a product of (i) the probability of\nhigh or low cash flows, and (ii) the risk-premium applied. If we change the assumed probability,\nbut keep the market value constant, then the risk-premium being applied must change.\nThe product of the probabilities and the forward state prices are known as the risk-neutral\nprobabilities which we denote by π*\nU and π*D. In our numerical example, the risk-neutral\nprobabilities are:\nπ*\nU = πU × φU = 43.3%\n(9.9)\nπ*D = πD × φD = 56.7%.\n(9.10)\nThe rationale behind the terminology is as follows. Suppose the forward state prices were the\nsame for both the up and the down states, φU=φD=1. This is what they would be if the risk-\npremium were zero, reflecting the fact that investors were risk-neutral, at least with respect to the\nrisk factor S. Probabilities calculated this way, under this counterfactual assumption, are called\nrisk-neutral probabilities.\nWe work with the risk neutral probabilities the same way we work with the true\nprobabilities. We refer to the risk-neutral probability distribution and can speak of the risk-neutral\nexpected value of the underlying risk factor, which we denote E*[S1]. The risk-neutral expected\nvalue isn't really an expected value. It is a discounted value. Whenever someone refers to the\nrisk-neutral expectation, what they are really referring to is a properly discounted value. We\ndistinguish the risk-neutral expected value from the expected value calculated using the true\nprobabilities, which we denote E[S1].\npage 9\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nWe can illustrate the difference between the risk-neutral expected value and the true\nexpected value by referring back to the numerical example. So far in our numerical example we\nnever specified a value for S, nor for SU, nor for SD. Suppose now that we specify\nS = 2.667\nSU = 4.347\nand,\nSD = 4.347\nThis implies that:\nE[S1] = (πU × SU +π D × SD ) = 3.573,\nand,\n*\n*\n*\nE*[S1] = (πU × SU +π D × SD\n* )= 3.469.\nNote that S=E[S1] and S=E*[S1]. Just as there is no general automatic relationship between\nthe current underlying factor price, S, and its expectation at a future date, nor is there such an\nautomatic relationship with its risk-neutral expectation at a future date.\nA relationship between the current underlying factor price and its expectation at a future\ndate does arise for specific types of factors. In particular, the current price of a stock must equal\nthe risk neutral expectation of the future stock price, inclusive of all dividends. This can be\ngeneralized to any financial asset, where the concept of dividends must be generalized\naccordingly to incorporate all forms of realized return. It can also be generalized to commodity\nprices where the concept of convenience yield must be developed to play a role as one form of\nrealized return and costs of storage must be netted out from the realized return. While these are\nterribly important special cases, they remain special cases. Students who first see the risk neutral\ndistribution developed for stock prices may err when they attempt to understand the risk neutral\ndistribution for other types of factors unless they grasp what is special about stocks.\nThe Forward Price as a Certainty-Equivalent Price\nForward prices play an important role in the practical implementation of the risk-neutral\nmethod and so it is worth examining forward prices in a little more detail. In the coming analysis,\nwe assume that our underlying risk factor, S, is a price. It may be a price for a commodity, such as\npage 10\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\noil, or it may be the price of an asset, such as a share of stock or a bond. Denote by Ft the forward\nprice quoted today for delivery of S one-period from now. A forward contract is a linear gamble\non the price of the factor S at date t+1. If it turns out that the price St+1 equals F, then the realized\nprofit on the forward contract is zero. For every $1 that the price S t+1 is above F, the realized\nprofit is greater by $1, and for every $1 that the price St+1 is below F, the realized profit is less by\n$1. By definition, the forward price is the certainty-equivalent for this linear gamble:\nFt = CEQt [St+1 ].\nWe can translate this into the risk-adjusted discounting framework by writing:\n-λ\nFt = CEQt [St+1 ]= E[St+1 ]e ,\n(9.11)\nwhere λ is the one-period risk-premium on a payoff linear in S. In a binomial tree we can expand\nthis further as:\n-λ\n-λ\nFt = CEQt [St+1 ]= E[St+1 ]e\n=(πU St+1,U +π D St+1,D )e .\n(9.12)\nIn the risk-neutral valuation framework we can write this as:\n*\n*\n*\nFt = CEQt [St+1 ]= Et [St+1 ]=(πU St+1,U +π D St+1,D ).\n(9.13)\nFrom equation 9.12 we see that if we know the true probabilities and the risk-premium,\nthen we can calculate the forward price. If we know the forward price, we cannot back out the\nrisk-premium without making an assumption on the true probabilities, and we cannot back out the\ntrue probabilities without making an assumption on the risk-premium. Equation 9.12 puts a\nrestriction on the combination of the true probabilities and the risk-premium. Rewriting the\nequation as 9.13 we see that if we avoid taking a stand on the specific combination of the true\nprobabilities and risk-premium. If we know the forward price we can back out the risk-neutral\nprobabilities without making any additional assumptions.\n9.3 Implementing Risk-Neutral Valuation\nSolving for the Risk Neutral Probability in Binomial Trees\nIn Chapter 6 we showed how a binomial tree could be constructed to model the risk of a\nfactor S. Here we show how to add pricing for risk on top of that model.\npage 11\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nViewed period-by-period, the general mechanics apply to any binomial tree, whether it is\nused to model a random walk or a mean reverting process or any other risk structure. The\nresulting valuations of assets with payoffs in distant states will vary according to the assumed\nfactor risk structure since, as we saw in Chapter 6, the risk at distant horizons varies under the\ndifferent models. We begin by showing the period-by-period mechanics, and then later we\ndiscuss the implication over longer horizons.\nRandom Walk Example\nRecall from Chapter 6 the binomial tree shown in Figure 6.7. The example began with a\nfactor price of S0=$10 so that ln(S0)=2.303. We assumed that the factor evolved as a random walk\nwith a drift parameter μ=7% and a volatility σ=22%. We constructed the next period outcomes to\nbe equally distributed around the expected value E[ln(S1)]=ln(S0)+(μ -1⁄2σ2)=2.348, so that\nln(S1U)= E[ln(S1)]+σ=2.568 and ln(S1D)= E[ln(S1)]-σ=2.128, giving S1U=$13.04 and S1D=$8.40.\nBy specifying that the two outcomes be centered around the expected value, we have effectively\nset πU=πD=1⁄2.\nOn top of this structure we now want to add the risk pricing. We can do that either by (i)\nspecifying the one-period forward price on S, or (ii) specifying λ, the one-period risk-premium on\na linear gamble on S. If we do (i), it implies (ii), and if we do (ii) it implies (i). In this calculation\nwe specify λ=5% and back out Ft as follows:\n-λ\n-λ\nFt = E[St+1 ]e\n=(πU St+1,U +π D St+1,D )e\n= $10.20.\n(9.14)\nHaving defined the forward price, we can back out the risk-neutral probabilities using the\nequation:\n*\n*\n(πU SU +π DSD )= Ft = $10.20\n(9.15)\nwhich can be rewritten and solved for πU\n*\nπU\n* =(πU SU +π DSD )e-λ -SD = CEQ[S ~\n1]-SD = 39% .\n(9.16)\n(SU -SD )\n(SU -SD )\nWe assume that the risk pricing structure of the tree is constant throughout, meaning that\nthe one-period risk premium is fixed at λ=5%. This means that the risk-neutral probability will be\nconstant throughout the tree at π*\nU=39%.\npage 12\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nUsing this risk-neutral probability instead of the original probability essentially defines a\nnew binomial model as shown in Figure 9.4. All of the nodes in this tree are the same as the\nnodes of the original tree shown in Figure 6.7: S0=$10, S1U=$13.04 and S1D=$8.40. However, with\nthe altered probabilities, we have changed the expected price at each node:\nE*[ln(S1)]=2.299<2.348= E[ln(S1)]. We say that the expected price under the risk neutral\nprobabilities is less than the expected price under the true probabilities. The difference represents\nthe discounting for risk implicit in the risk neutral probabilities.\nHaving constructed a new binomial tree with the correct risk-neutral probability at every\nbranching, we are now capable of valuing any asset with cash flows contingent on the underlying\nrisk factor.\nBefore moving forward to do the valuations, let's repeat the exercise of finding the risk-\nneutral distribution, but this time on one step of a binomial tree constructed to describe a mean\nreverting process. This will make clear that the mechanics of solving for the risk-neutral\ndistribution are the same regardless of the process being modeled.\nMean Reversion Example\nWe take the example from Chapter 6, Part B on Mean Reverting Processes. The example\nbegan at the same starting point as the previous example, with a factor price S0=$10 so that\nln(S0)=2.303. We assumed that the mean log price to which the process reverts is ln( S )=2.079 so\nthat S =$8. The rate of mean reversion is κ=0.75 and the volatility is σ=22%. In our default\nmethodology for constructing binomial trees, we constructed the next period outcomes to be\nequally distributed around the expected value E[ln(S1)]=ln(S0)+e-κ(ln(S0)- S )=2.185, so that\nln(S1U)= E[ln(S1)]+σ=2.405 and ln(S1D)= E[ln(S1)]-σ=1.965, giving S1U=$11.08 and S1D=$7.13.\nThis methodology necessarily sets πU=πD=1⁄2 for the mean reverting tree, too.\nOn top of this structure we now add the risk pricing by specifying λ=5% and backing out\nFt:\n-λ\n-λ\nFt = E[St+1 ]e\n=(πU St+1,U +π D St+1,D )e\n= $8.69.\nThe forward price in the mean reverting process is less than the forward price in the random walk.\nThis is because we started at an initial price, S0=$10.00 that was above the price to which we\nassumed the price reverted, S =$8.00. Therefore the mean reverting process adds a negative drift\npage 13\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nwithin this period. Had we started at an initial price below the mean level, there would have been\na positive drift.\nHaving defined the forward price, we can back out the risk-neutral probabilities using the\nequation:\n*\n*\n(πU SU +π DSD )= Ft = $8.69\nwhich can be rewritten and solved for πU\n*\nSD +πU\n* (SU -SD )=(πU SU +π DSD )e-λ\n* (πU SU +π DSD )e-λ -SD CEQ[S ~ ]-S\nπU =\n=\nD =39% .\n(SU -SD )\n(SU -SD )\nAlthough the forward price in the mean reverting binomial step differs from the forward price in\nthe random walk step, the risk-neutral probabilities are the same.\nIf we assume that the structure of the tree is essentially constant throughout, then this is\nthe risk-neutral probability at each branching.\nUsing this risk-neutral probability instead of the original probability essentially defines a\nnew binomial model as shown in Figure 9.5. All of the nodes in this tree are the same as the\nnodes of the original tree shown in Figure 6.X: S0=$10, S1U=$11.08 and S1D=$7.13. However,\nwith the altered probabilities, we have changed the expected price at each node:\nE*[ln(S1)]=2.139<2.185= E[ln(S1)].\nValuation in Binomial Trees Using The Risk Neutral Distribution\nNow that we know how to derive the risk-neutral probability for a binomial tree, we are\nready to value any series of cash flows through time that are contingent on the underlying risk\nfactors, S. This is where we first see the advantage that the risk-neutral method has over the risk-\nadjusted method. Once we have defined the structure of the tree and derived the risk-neutral\nprobability, which we need only do once, the algorithm for valuing a contingent cash flow is the\nsame for all cash flows. There is no need to devise the algorithm for the cash flow.\nLet Ct(S) be a cash flow received at time t and contingent on the realization of the\nunderlying risk factor, S. In the traditional risk-adjusted discount rate method, the present value of\npage 14\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nC is given by calculating the expected value of a cash flow and applying a risk-adjusted discount\nrate:\nPV0 [C\nt ]= E0 [C\nt ]e-ra t ,\n(9.17)\n~\nwhere Ct is the risky contingent cash flow at time, t, determined by the function Ct(S). The\nexpectation uses the true distribution. The problem is that the correct risk-adjusted discount rate\ndepends upon the contingent structure of the cash flows, as we have already seen. There is no\nuniversal algorithm that determines the correct risk-adjusted rate.\nIn the risk-neutral methodology we mimic the traditional valuation formula, but with\nminor differences. We take the expected value of the cash flow, but we use the risk neutral\nprobability distribution. This expected value will be lower than had we used the true distribution.\nThen we apply the risk-free discount rate:\nPV0 [C\nt ]= E0\n* [C\nt ]e\n-rf t .\n(9.18)\nAll of the discounting for risk occurs through the reduction in the expected value produced by the\nuse of the risk neutral distribution. The risk-neutral distribution, remember, is really a discounted\nvaluation.\nExample 1. Symmetric Risk, Single-Period\nA simple case is a cash flow earned at t=1 and proportional to the underlying risk factor:\nCU = qSU and CD = qSD, where q is the proportionality constant. The present value is\nPV0 [C ~\n1 ]= E0\n* [C ~\n1 ]e\n-rf = q(πU\n* SU +π D\n* SD )e\n-rf .\nAssuming the same values for the inputs as used in our earlier example of the random\nwalk, we have S1U=$13.04 and S1D=$8.40, πU=50%, and πU\n*=39%. We also assume a risk-free\nrate, rf=4%. Then the present value is\nPV0 [C ~\n1 ]=q (39%(13.04)+61%(8.40))0.961=q 9.80 .\nNote that this could just as easily have been calculated using the risk adjusted discount\nrate, ra=rf+λ=4%+5%=9%:\na\na\nPV0 [C ~\n1 ]=E0 [C ~\n1 ]e-r =q (πU SU +π DSD )e-r .\npage 15\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\n=q (50%(13.04)+50%(8.40))0.914 = q 9.80 .\nIn this first example, the risk-adjusted method and the risk neutral method give the same\nanswer. Indeed, all this simple one-period case really does is repeat the definition of the risk\nneutral probability. But in the following examples we shall see that the risk-neutral methodology\nproves both easy to use and offers telling insights about the risk embedded in various cash flow\npatterns.\nExample 2. Skewed Risk, Single-Period\nConsider a payoff like a call option on S: CU = X and CD = 0. We can think of X=q(SU-K),\nwhere q is the number of options and K is an exercise price. Obviously, by adjusting q and K we\ncan arrive at any value of X. But there is no need to think of the payoff X as coming from a call\noption. This is just a risky payoff with a distribution that is skewed relative to the underlying risk\nfactor, S.\nUsing the risk neutral valuation methodology, we have,\nPV0 C\n1 =\n* [C\n1]e\n-rf = π * X e\n-rf ,\n[ ]\nE0\nU\nAssuming the numbers from our random walk example, so that πU\n*=39% and rf=4%, this reduces\nto,\nPV [C ~ ]=39%(X )0.961=0.373 X .\nIn this case, we cannot replicate the result using the standard risk-adjusted discount rate,\nwhere ra=rf+λ=4%+5%=9%:\nPV0 [C\n1]=E0 [C\n1]e-ra = πU X e-ra\n=50%(X )0.914 = 0.454 X > 0.373 X .\nWe could, of course, find some other risk-adjusted discount rate which would give the correct\nanswer. After all, we can just solve the one equation for the one unknown variable, telling us that\nthe risk-adjusted rate that produces the correct value is 29.4%. But that assumes the correct\nanswer to the valuation problem, instead of producing it!\nNote that the implicit risk-adjusted discount rate on the skewed payoff is higher than the\nrate used for the underlying risk factor and for any linear payoff structure--29.4% as compared to\npage 16\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\n9%. This is because the cash flow in skewed payoff structure is \"riskier\" than the underlying risk\nfactor. We saw this in Chapter 6 when we showed that the risk of a call option was always greater\nthan the risk of the underlying stock, with the amount of extra risk depending upon how in or out-\nof-the-money is the option.2\nExample 3. Two-Period, Compounded Risk\nWe now consider a case like Example #1 above where the cash flow earned is\nproportional to the underlying risk factor, but we assume that the cash flow is earned only in the\nsecond period, t=2. The figure below shows the payoffs: CUU=qSUU, CUD=CDU=qSUD, and\nCDD=qSDD. Assuming the same values for the inputs as used in our earlier example of the random\nwalk, and extending it to the second period, we have SUU=$17.02, SUD=SDU=$10.96, SDD=$7.06.\nOf course, πU=50%, and πU\n*=39%, and rf=4%. The present value is\nPV0 C\n2 =\n* C\n2 e\n-2 rf = q π * π *\nπ *\n+π * π *\nπ *\ne\n-2 rf\n[ ]\nE0 [ ]\n[ U ( U SUU +\nD SUD )\nD ( U SDU +\nD SDD )]\n\n= q 9.61.\nOnce again we have a result that could just as easily have been calculated using the\ntraditional risk-adjusted discount rate method with ra =rf+λ=4%+5%=9% as follows:\nPV0 C\n2 =\nC\n2 e-2 ra = q π\nπ\nπ\n+π\nπ\nπ\ne-2 ra\n[ ]\nE0 [ ]\n[ U ( U SUU +\nD SUD )\nD ( U SDU +\nD SDD )]\n\n= q 9.60.\nSo in this particular case, for this symmetric distribution with risk that grows linearly\nwith time, the risk neutral valuation is equivalent to discounting by the compounded risk-adjusted\ndiscount rate.\nExample 4. Two-Period, Non-compounded Risk\nWe now consider another example in which the cash flow earned at t=2 is proportional to\nthe underlying risk factor: CUU=qSUU, CUD=qSUD, CDU=qSDU, and CDD=qSDD. However, in this case\n2 For the special case of payoff structures that are pure European options on the underlying stock there is a\nsimple formula relating the Beta of the option to the Beta of the stock, depending upon how in the money is\nthe option and how long to maturity. This can, of course, then be tied back to the required rate of return on\nthe option as a function of the required rate of return on the stock. See Cox, John and Mark Rubenstein,\nOption Markets, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, section 5-5.\npage 17\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nthe underlying risk factor, S, is mean reverting. Therefore, we have SUU=$11.62, SUD=$7.49,\nSDU=$9.44, SDD=$6.08. Recall that our standard methodology for constructing a binomial tree for\na mean reverting process does not yield a recombining tree, so the second period has four distinct\nnodes. As before, πU=50%, and πU\n*=39%, and rf=4%. Using the risk neutral method, the present\nvalue is\n[ ]\nE0\n(\n(\ne\nPV0 C\n2 =\n* [ ]\nC\n2 e\n-2 rf = q [πU\n* πU\n* SUU +π *\nD SUD )+π *\nD πU\n* SDU +π *\nD SDD )]\n-2 rf\n\n= q 7.46.\nWhat happens if we try to apply the risk-adjusted discount rate, compounding for the two\nyear horizon:\n\n-2 ra\n-2 ra\n[ ]\nC2\nq π\n)\n)]\nPV0 C2 =E0 [ ]e\n= [ U (πU SUU +π D SUD +π D (πU SDU +π D SDD\ne\n\n= q 7.23 < q 7.46.\nIn this case, compounding the discount rate produces too low of a value. Because of\nmean reversion, the total risk in the second period cash flows is not equal to twice the risk in the\nfirst period cash flows.\nExamples #1 and #3 illustrate that where the cash flow pattern fits the strict assumptions\nbehind the traditional risk-adjusted discount rate methodology, the risk-neutral method arrives at\nthe same result. Examples #2 and #4 illustrate cases that do not fit the traditional risk-adjusted\ndiscount rate method. Nevertheless, the risk-neutral method can be applied without amendment. It\nis this robustness that makes the risk-neutral method such a powerful and valuable tool.\npage 18\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nFigure 9.1\nTwo Methods for Discounting\nRisk-adjusted discount rate method\nRisk-adjusted discount rate method\nDiscount for risk and time\n\nFuture\n\nPresent\n\ncash\n\nvalue\n\nflo\nw\nDiscount\n\nDiscount\n\nfor risk\n\nfor time\n\nCertainty-equivalent or risk-neutral method\nCertainty-equivalent or risk-neutral method\npage 31\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nFigure 9.2\nProject Cash Flows\nt=0\nt=1\nhigh cash flow, CFU=\n$13.04\nProject value, VP=\n10.00\nlow cash flow, CFD=\n$8.40\nπU=50%\nπD=50%\npage 32\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nDeriv. value, VU=\nt=0\n?\nFigure 9.3\nDerivative Cash Flows\nt=1\nhigh cash flow, CFU=\nlow cash flow =\n$13.04\n$0\nDeriv. value, VD=\n?\nhigh cash flow =\nlow cash flow, CFD =\n$0\n$8.40\nBond value, B=\n?\nhigh cash flow =\nlow cash flow =\n$1\n$1\nπU=50%\nπD=50%\nπU=50%\nπD=50%\nπU=50%\nπD=50%\npage 33\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nFigure 9.4\nRevised Binomial Tree: Risk-Neutral Probabilities for the Random Walk\nt=0\nt=1\nhigh return, U=\n31.6%\nhigh log price=\n2.618\n\nhigh price, SU=\n13.71\ninitial price, S0=\n10.00\ninitial log price=\n2.303\nlow return, D=\n-12.4%\nlow log price=\n2.178\nlow price, SD=\n8.83\nπ*\nU=39%\nπ*\nD=61%\npage 34\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nFigure 9.5\nRevised Binomial Tree: Risk-Neutral Probabilities for Mean Reversion\nt=0\nt=1\nhigh log price=\n2.405\n\nhigh price, SU=\n11.08\ninitial price, S0=\n10.00\ninitial log price=\n2.303\nmean log price=\n2.079\nexp(mean log p)= 8.00\nlow log price=\n1.965\nlow price, SD=\n7.13\nπ*\nU=39%\nπ*\nD=61%\npage 35\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nTable 9.1\nThe Hejira Oil Corp: Two Alternative Methods for Valuing Production\nMethod #1: Risk Adjusted Discount Rate Method -- simultaneously adjust for risk and time\nYear\nForecasted Production (000 bbls)\n10,000\n9,000\n8,000\n7,000\n6,000\nForecasted Spot Price ($/bbl) -- current price $38\n35.00\n33.50\n32.75\n32.38\n32.19\nForecasted Spot Revenue ($ 000)\n350,000\n301,500\n262,000\n226,625\n193,125\nRisk-adjusted Discount Rate, ra\n10.0%\n10.0%\n10.0%\n10.0%\n10.0%\nRisk-adjusted Discount Factor\n0.9048\n0.8187\n0.7408\n0.6703\n0.6065\nPV ($ 000)\n316,693\n246,847\n194,094\n151,911\n117,136\nTotal PV Spot Sales ($ 000)\n1,026,682\nMethod #2: Certainty Equivalent or Risk-Neutral Method -- separately adjust for risk then for time\nForecasted Spot Revenue ($ 000)\n350,000\n301,500\n262,000\n226,625\n193,125\nCertainty Equivalence Risk Premium, λ\n6.0%\n6.0%\n6.0%\n6.0%\n6.0%\nCertainty Equivalence Factor\n94.2%\n88.7%\n83.5%\n78.7%\n74.1%\nCertainty Equivalent Revenue\n329,618\n267,407\n218,841\n178,270\n143,071\nRiskless Discount Rate, rf\n4.0%\n4.0%\n4.0%\n4.0%\n4.0%\nRiskless Discount Factor\n0.9608\n0.9231\n0.8869\n0.8521\n0.8187\nPV ($ 000)\n316,693\n246,847\n194,094\n151,911\n117,136\nTotal PV Spot Sales ($ 000)\n1,026,682\npage 36\n\nChapter 9: Pricing Risk\nTable 9.2\nDerivative Valuation for an Alternative Probability Assumption\nOriginal\nRevised\nInputs\nCFU\n$13.04\nCFD\n$8.40\nVP\n$10.00\nπU\n50%\n60%\nπD\n50%\n40%\nrf\n4.0%\nOutputs\nφU\n0.866\n0.721\nφD\n1.134\n1.418\nπ∗\nU=πUφU\n0.433\n0.433\nπ∗\nD=πDφD\n0.567\n0.567\nVU\n$5.42\n$5.42\nVD\n$4.58\n$4.58\nVLP\n$5.00\n$5.00\nλP\n3.0%\n7.2%\nλU\n14.4%\n32.7%\nλD\n-12.6%\n-34.9%\nλLP\n5.8%\n13.9%\npage 37"
