It studies the increasing interaction between communities as the barrier of distance succumbed to both curiosity and new transport technologies. It explores the rise of Western Europe and the United States in the period, as well as the great divergence in material, political, and technological development between Western Europe and East Asia after 1750 and its impact on the rest of the world. It examines a series of evolving relationships: human beings and their physical environment; religious and political systems; and subgroups within communities as sorted by race, class, and gender. It introduces historical and other interpretive methodologies using both primary and secondary source materials. It considers architectural, musical, and visual evidence, in addition to textual sources.\n\nRequirements\n\nActive class participation is central to our work together. Attendance is mandatory, and students are expected to arrive in class on time and prepared to discuss common readings. Students will prepare ten short assignments spaced evenly throughout the term, and one five page paper due at our final class meeting. We will conduct two in-class debates during sessions 9 and 17. Each student will have a central speaking role in at least one of these debates. Instructions for the short assignments, the five page paper, and the debates will be distributed later in the term. There will be no midterm and no final. Each assignment will be weighted in the calculation of the final grade, although these calculations will also take into account improved performance during the course of the semester.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass Participation\n\nDebates\n\n5 Short Written Assignments\n\n25 (5% each)\n\n3 Visual Exercises\n\n15 (5% each)\n\nFinal Assignment (5-page paper)\n\nCourse Materials\n\nRelevant chapters from this textbook are required, or in some cases recommended, on the\nReadings\nschedule:\n\nTignor, Robert, et al.\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart.

HEX subjects are team-taught courses that explore a major concept or topic from multiple viewpoints found across or within disciplines in the humanities, arts, and social sciences. By showcasing the generative value of dialogue and debate among diverse disciplines, specials, theoretical frameworks, or methodologies, HEX subjects allow students to approach a given problem, phenomenon, or topic from multiple vantage points. Emphasizing close interaction with faculty, the courses encourage the development of foundational skills such as critical reading and analysis of primary materials. More broadly, they provide a pathway into modes of thinking that are central to the\nHASS\ncurriculum and offer students an opportunity to explore concepts, topics, and histories that are crucial to understanding and inhabiting the complex world in which we live.\n\nPlagiarism\n\nThe web now hosts many sites which offer college level papers of varying quality on a variety of topics. We are well acquainted with these sites, and with others that offer detection services to professors. Buying a paper and submitting it as your own work is cheating. Copying sections from someone else's print or online work into your own without an acknowledgement is plagiarism. MIT has strict policies against both activities that we will fully enforce. For the appropriate MIT definitions and policies, visit the following website,\nAcademic Integrity at MIT\n. If you are uncertain about what constitutes cheating or plagiarism, please contact one of the instructors before submitting the work in question.\n\nCalendar\n\nIn most weeks, the class met twice.

      "content": "EDITING SUGGESTIONS\nThe writing process includes rigorous editing practices. Below are some points to keep in\nmind as you re-read and edit your papers before turning them in. You may also wish to\nlook at the brief guide to writing by W. Strunk and E.B. White called the The Elements\nof Style\nSome Rules\n1. Avoid passive constructions. \"The chair was seen by me,\" is not as forceful as \"I\nsaw the chair.\"\n2. Use the past tense when describing historical individuals and events, not the\npresent tense.\n3. Avoid unnecessary words. After you have drafted your essay, set it aside for a day\nor two. Then reread it, eliminating every word that is redundant or does not add to\nyour meaning. Prime candidates for deletion are adverbs such as \"very,\" \"quite,\"\n\"extremely.\"\n4. Never use the phrase \"I feel that....\" This lends a subjective air to your argument\nthat tends to discredit you. Write \"I think that....\"\n5. Learn how to use the spell-checker on your computer program.\nSix Questions to Ask Before Turning in Your Paper\n1. Is the title of my essay informative?\n2. Do I state my thesis point soon enough, perhaps even in the first sentence, and\nkeep it in view throughout the paper? Is the opening paragraph interesting, and by\nits end, have I focused on the topic?\n3. Is my organization clear? Does each point lead into the next, without irrelevances\nand without anticlimaxes?\n4. Is each paragraph unified by a topic sentence or topic idea?\n5. Are sentences concise, clear and emphatic? Are needless words and inflated\nlanguage eliminated?\n6. Is the final paragraph conclusive without being repetitive?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n21H.009 The World: 1400-Present\n\nSpring 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
