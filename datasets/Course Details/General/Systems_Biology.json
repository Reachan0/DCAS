Students will be provided with the essential mathematical tools needed to model network modules, such as biological switches, oscillators, filters, amplifiers, etc. An array of example biological problems that can be successfully tackled with a systems biology approach will be introduced by discussing recent papers on the subject. The intrinsic challenge of this class is that students are coming in with wildly different backgrounds. Read up on your biology or math if needed. Use time in the recitations to help close some of the knowledge gaps and to help you prepare for the homework.\n\nThere are three levels of complexity to Systems Biology:\n\nI Systems Microbiology (14 Lectures) 'The cell as a well-stirred biochemical reactor'\n\nII Systems Cell Biology (8 Lectures) 'The cell as a compartmentalized system with concentration gradients'\n\nIII Systems Developmental Biology (3 Lectures) 'The cell in a social context communicating with neighboring cells'\n\nText\n\nThe\ncourse notes\nserve as the text.

This process\ngenerates outgoing spiral waves of cAMP which direct the entire population towards the original\nsource (Fig. 2). We will try to understand the origin of and response to these cAMP waves.\nImages removed due to copyright considerations.\n1.\nChemical kinetics of cAMP signaling\nTwo species of cAMP receptors exist in the Dictyostelium cell membrane: the 'activator' A, and the\n'inhibitor' I, both of which act on a third protein R. When bound to cAMP, a pair of A molecules\ncatalyzes the conversion of R to an active form R*, and a pair of I molecules catalyzes the reverse\nreaction (Fig. 3).\n(5)\na.\nThe initial binding of cAMP (C) to its receptors is described by:\nkA +\nkI +\nA + C\nAC\nI + C\nIC .\nkA -\nkI -\nWrite down equations giving the time evolution of [AC] and [IC]. Now assume that [AC] <<\n[Atot], and [IC] << [Itot]; let a ≡ [ AC], i ≡ [IC] , and c ≡ [C]. By making a convenient choice\nof units, show that these equations can be written in the form\nda = k - (c - a)\ndi = k - (c - i) .\n(1)\ndt\nA\ndt\nI\nFA04\n\nSystems Biology\n7.81 / 8.591 / 9.531\n(5)\nb.\nThe reactions involving activation and inactivation of R reach a rapid equilibrium:\nkR +⋅ a\nR\nR *.\nkR -⋅ i\nThe a2 and i2 terms arise because it takes two molecules of AC or IC to catalyze these\nconversion reactions. Setting β = k - / k + , find an expression for the rapid equilibrium value\nR\nR\nof r ≡[R*] in terms of a, i, and [Rtot].\n2.\nPositive feedback and oscillations\nThe molecule R is an enzyme known as adenylate cyclase, which in its active form catalyzes the\nconversion of ATP into cAMP in the cytoplasm. The presence of extracellular cAMP thus stimulates\nthe synthesis of intracellular cAMP, which in turn is secreted into the environment, creating a positive\nfeedback loop (Fig. 3). Let c1 ≡ [cAMP ] ; let the rate of cytoplasmic cAMP synthesis be\nr\nk\n; and\nin\nlet the rate constant for its secretion be k0. cAMP is continuously degraded by phosphodiesterase\nenzymes both inside and outside the cell, with rate constants γ 1 and γ 0, respectively. The entire\nnetwork is described by the following equations:\ndc\ndc1 = r\nk - (γ + k0)c\n=\nc\nk\n1 -γ 0 c .\n(2)\ndt\ndt\n(5)\na.\nAssuming that the concentrations c1 and a reach rapid equilibrium, reduce the four equations\n-\nin (1) and (2) to two equations for the slow variables c and i.

However, under such conditions, the cAMP concentration\nis known to oscillate over time. Find the conditions on k and β so that the system is\noscillatory.\n(5)\nc.\nOn a graph of i vs. c, plot the nullclines and simulate the time evolution of the system for an\noscillatory case.\n(5)\nd.\nSuppose it only required a single molecule of AC or IC in order to catalyze the R conversion\nreactions. Comment on the stability of the system in this case.\nFA04\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nSystems Biology\n7.81 / 8.591 / 9.531\n3.\nDiffusion and cAMP waves\nWhen cells are grown on a plate, cAMP diffusion is slow, and the extracellular cAMP concentration is\nno longer uniform. Consider a plate on which there exists a uniformly distributed population of cells.\nEach cell senses cAMP in its environment, and secretes fresh cAMP in response. This new batch of\ncAMP is able to reach neighboring cells, stimulating them to synthesize more cAMP, and so on. The\nsituation is similar to one in which a number of radio transmitter towers (cells) are used to detect,\namplify, and re-broadcast a weak radio signal (cAMP). The cAMP concentration now varies over\nspace as well as time. For simplicity, we will analyze a 1-dimensional case, with cells uniformly\ndistributed along a line. We can assume that the cells have fixed positions over the timescales\nconsidered, because their chemotaxis is relatively slow. This system obeys the equations\n∂c\nc 2\n∂ 2 c\n∂i\n=\n- c + D\n=\nc\nk\n- i) .\n(\n∂t\nβ ⋅ i + c 2\n∂x 2\n∂t\nWe have provided MATLAB code which simulates the time evolution of a reaction-diffusion system.\nModify the code to implement these equations. The system is assumed to extend from x = -1 to x = +1,\nwith no flow at the boundaries. Use the following initial conditions:\nt\nx\nc\n= 0) = exp(-x 2 / 2σ )\nt\nx\ni\n= 0) = i0 .\n( ,\n( ,\nThat is, provide an initial pulse of cAMP centered at the origin, and some non-zero amount of\ninhibitor activity in all cells.\n(10)\na.\nUse the following parameters: β = 4 ; k = 5.0 ; D = 10-7 ; σ = 1.0 ; i0 = 1.0 . Run the\nsimulation to see the emergence of cAMP waves emanating from the origin. Plot out a typical\ncAMP profile, indicating the direction of motion of the waves.\n(5)\nb.\nRun the simulation again, this time with a k value which produces a non-oscillating system.\nDescribe the typical cAMP profile once the transients have died out. Can cells find the initial\nsource of cAMP based on this type of profile?\n(5)\nc.\nA simple concentration gradient would allow cells to find the cAMP source. Why do you\nthink Dictyostelium uses waves of cAMP rather than a gradient in order to trigger cell\naggregation?\n4.\nReceptor clustering and signal amplification\nThe cells must now sense and move towards the source of the cAMP waves. It is unknown precisely\nhow the amoebae are able convert the small front-to-back difference in cAMP concentration into the\nlarge output signal necessary to drive cell motion. However, a similar amplification of small temporal\nchanges in ligand concentration into large changes in receptor activity has been observed in bacterial\nchemotaxis networks. We will now discuss a receptor clustering model that has been proposed in order\nto explain this amplification. Consider a receptor molecule R that is activated by the binding of some\nligand L. Let α = 0,1 represent the activity of the receptor. Thus,\nk +\nR + L\nRL\n(α =0)\nk\n(α =1)\n-\nFA04\n\nSystems Biology\n7.81 / 8.591 / 9.531\ne\n(5)\na.\nThe probability that the system will be found in a state with energy E is proportional to\n- E / kT . Show that the energy of the receptor molecule may be written in the form\n- E / kT = A ⋅α .\nBy calculating the mean activity α and equating this to the value known from chemical\nkinetics, find an expression for A in terms of L, k+ and k-..\n(5)\nb.\nNow consider a lattice of receptors Ri, each with activity α i. Suppose that an active receptor is\nable to activate nearby receptors even if they are not ligand-bound. The energy of Ri can then\nbe written as\nn\n- Ei / kT = A ⋅α + B Σ\n⋅\nj= 1(α i - 2\n1 )(α j - 2\n1 )\ni\nwhere the sum over j is a sum over the n nearest neighbors of Ri. How does the state of the\nneighboring receptors influence the energy of Ri?\n(5)\nc.\nAssume that the activity of each neighboring receptor may be approximated by its mean value.\nn\nThat is, Σ j = 1α j ≅ nα . By substituting this expression into the above equation, find an\nexpression for the mean activity α of receptor Ri.\ni\n(5)\nd.\nThere is nothing special about the particular receptor Ri: our calculations could equally have\nbeen applied to any other receptor in the system. Therefore, the mean activity α must be\ni\nequal to the mean activity α of the neighboring receptors. Apply this consistency condition to\nfind an equation for α , and show how this equation may be solved graphically. (Hint: it is\neasier to work with the variable s = α -1/2.)\n(10)\ne.\nExplore the possible system responses as a function of the parameters A and B. For low values\nof B, the equation has a single solution for all A values. For high values of B, the system goes\nfrom having one, to three, then back to one solution as A is swept from -inf to +inf . Find the\ncritical value Bc which separates these two behaviors. Explain why the system response\nchanges as this critical value is crossed. Which regime is more relevant for understanding\nsignaling?\n(5)\nf.\nAssuming B < Bc, calculate the logarithmic amplification\n∂ ln(α )\nL ∂α\nG =\n=\n,\n∂ ln(L)\nα ∂ L L0\nL0\nwhere L0 = k- / k+ is the dissociation constant for ligand-receptor binding. Plot G as a function\nof B, and verify that it approaches the correct limit as B approaches zero. We see that the\namplification can be made arbitrarily large by appropriately tuning B. What is the possible\ndisadvantage of doing this?\n(10)\ng.\nBased on published experimental data, estimate the logarithmic amplification at each stage of\nthe Escherichia coli chemotaxis network. Is there any evidence that receptor clustering\ncontributes to this amplification?\nFA04"

We consider two possible system architectures (arrows represent activation, blunt\nends represent inhibition):\n(A)\n(B)\nX\nY\nX\nY\nThe corresponding dynamical equations are (using x = [ X ] and y = [Y ]):\ndx\nA1\ndx\ndt = v + k\nx\n= v + k\nx\nx\nx A1 + y -γ x\ndt\nx\nx A3\nx\n+ x 2 A1\nA\n+\ny -γ x\n(A)\n(B)\n.\nx\nx\ndy = vy + k y\n-γ y y\ndy = v + k\n-γ y\ndt\ny\ny\ndt\nA2 + x\n+ x\ny\nA2\n1.\nBiochemical interpretation of dynamical equations\n(10)\na.\nIdentify the parameters corresponding to basal transcription rate, maximal\ntranscription rate, and degradation rate.\n(10)\nb.\nWe have assumed the following: for both (A) and (B), the X promoter is inactivated by\nthe binding of a single molecule of Y, and the Y promoter is activated by the binding of\na single molecule of X. In addition, for (B), the X promoter is activated by the\ncooperative binding of two molecules of X. The various fractions that appear in the\ndynamical equations represent the fractions of promoters that are active under these\nconditions. Give a biochemical interpretation of each of these fractions.\n2.\nNormalization of units. Assume that A2 >> x. Define new time and concentration units\nso that t = γ yt , x = x / A , and y = y / A .

You should find that\nthe nullclines intersect only once, dividing the graph into four regions.

You should find that system (A) does not\noscillate, while system (B) does. It turns out that autoactivation by X is crucial to the\ngeneration of oscillations. Problem 4 examines the reasons why this is so.\n4.\nStability analysis. Let {x0 , y0} be a fixed point of the system (so that f(x0,y0) = 0,\ng(x0,y0) = 0).

Let γx be a free parameter.\nFind the fixed point of the system numerically. The matrix A evaluated at the fixed\npoint should be a function of γx alone. Oscillations will arise whenever this fixed point\nbecomes unstable. Write down the conditions on γx under which the system is\noscillatory.

Meanwhile, a concentration gradient is set up in the\nbeaker, with [cAMP] = cp at the pipette tip, and zero far from the tip. The purpose of this\nproblem is to calculate the resulting concentration profile.\n(10)\na.\nConsider a spherical surface of radius r, centered at the pipette tip, through which\nthere flows a flux per unit area J(r) (see Fig. 1). What is the total flux F(r) through this\nsurface?\n(10)\nb.\nSince cAMP is neither created nor degraded in the beaker, the total flux through a\nsphere at any radius must be a constant; that is, F(r) = F.

From problem 1 we find that the concentration distribution due to a\npipette tip can be written as the potential due to a point charge with q = c pr . If the\np\ncell is small compared with its distance from the pipette tip, this potential can be\napproximated as linear, providing the starting point for problem 2.

We now calculate how the cell might respond to such\na stimulus, based on the receptor activation/inactivation model of Levchenko and Iglesias.\nThis model assumes that two biochemical species, A and I, are produced in the cell membrane\nat rates linearly proportional to the extracellular signal concentration c(θ ). The levels of these\nbiochemicals are \"read out\" by a receptor R whose steady state concentration is given by\nr\n≈a / i (where lower case letters represent normalized concentrations).

Also write down an expression for rss (θ ).\n(10)\nc.\nSuppose that A diffuses very slowly, while I diffuses fast. That is,\nDa/γ a << 1,\nDi/γ i >> 1.\nWhat is rss (θ ) in this limit?\n(5)\nd.\nThese calculations show that the system is perfectly adapting in uniform\nconcentrations, but polarized in a concentration gradient, matching expeirmental\nobservations.

      "content": "I Michaelis-Menten kinetics\nThe goal of this chapter is to develop the mathematical techniques to quantitatively\nmodel biochemical reactions. Biochemical reactions in living cells are often catalyzed by\nenzymes. These enzymes are proteins that bind and subsequently react specifically with\nother molecules (other proteins, DNA, RNA, or small molecules) defined as substrates. A\nfew examples:\n1.\nThe conversion of glucose (substrate) into glucose-6-phosphate (product) by the\nprotein hexokinase (enzyme).\n2.\nTranscription: binding of the RNA polymerase (enzyme) to the promoter region\nof the DNA (substrate) results in transcription of the mRNA (product).\n3.\nThe phosphorylation of a protein: the unphosphorylated protein CheY (substrate,\nregulating the direction of rotation of the bacterial flagella) is phosphorylated by a\nphosphate CheZ (enzyme) resulting in CheY-p (product).\nAll these reactions involve a substrate S reacting with an enzyme E to form a complex ES\nwhich then in turn is converted into product P and the enzyme:\nk1\nk2\nE + S\nES\nE + P\n[I.1]\nk-1\nIn this scheme there are two fundamental different reactions. The first reaction depicted\nwith the double arrow is a reversible reaction reflecting the reversible binding and\nunbinding of the enzyme and the substrate. The second reaction is an irreversible reaction\nin which the enzyme-substrate complex is irreversibly converted into product and\nenzyme symbolized by the single arrow. The rate of a reaction is proportional to the\nproduct of the concentrations of the reactants. The kinetics of the chemical equations\nabove is described by the following set of coupled differential equations:\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nd[S]\n-\n=\n[E][S]\nk\n+ k [ES]\n- 1\ndt\nd[E]\n-\n=\n[E][S]\nk\n+ (k +\n)[ES]\nk\n- 1\ndt\n[I.2]\nd[ES] = [E][S]\nk\n- (k +\n)[ES]\nk\n- 1\ndt\nd[P] =\n[ES]\nk\n≡ v\ndt\nNote that k1 and k-1 have different units, 1/(Ms) and 1/s respectively. The turnover rate v\nis defined as the increase (or decrease) in product over time, which is directly\nproportional to the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex [ES]. For the analysis\nbelow we will assume initial conditions: [S]t=0 = So; [E]t=0 = Eo; [ES]t=0 = 0; [P]t=0 = 0.\nSince the enzyme is a catalyst that facilitates the reaction but does not react itself, the\ntotal concentration of enzyme (free + bound) should be constant:\nE = [E] + [ES]\n[I.3]\no\nUsing this conservation law the four differential equations [I.2] reduce to three coupled\nordinary differential equations:\nd[S]\n-\n=\n[S]\nE\nk\n+\n[S]\n(k\n+\n)[ES]\nk\ndt\no\n-\nd[ES] =\n[S]\nE\nk\n-\n[S]\n(k\n+ k +\n)[ES]\nk\n[I.4]\ndt\no\n-\nd[P] =\n[ES]\nk\n≡ v\ndt\nwith the initial conditions [S]t=0 = So, [ES]t=0 = 0, and [P]t=0 = 0. Matlab code 1 solves\nthese equations and calculates the time dependence of the concentrations [S], [ES] and\n[P] as a function of the initial concentrations [So] and [Eo] and the rate constants k1, k-1,\nand k2. In this case the systems can also be solved analytically. Figure 1 shows an\nexample of the time dependence of the chemical components for k1[So] ≈ k-1 >> k2. This\nis often the regime of biological relevance since the substrate-enzyme binding occurs at\nmuch faster time scales than the turnover into product. The thermodynamic equilibrium\nor steady state (t→ inf) of this system would be [S] = [ES] = 0; [E] = [Eo]; [P] = [So].\nHowever the relevant time-scale to consider is the time range in which [ES] and [E] are\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nrelatively constant. This state is often called the quasi-equilibrium or pseudo-steady state.\nUnder these circumstances one expects that after an initial short transient period there\nwill be a balance between the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex and the\nbreaking apart of complex (either to enzyme and substrate, or to enzyme and product). In\nthe pseudo-steady state (d[ES]/dt = d[E]/dt = 0) (I.4) reduces to:\no\n[ES] =\n[S]E\nk\n[S]\nk\n+ k + k2\n-\ndP\n[S]E\nk\n[I.5]\nv =\n=\no\ndt\nk 1\n- + k2 + [S]\nk1\nIn the case of many more substrate than enzyme molecules (So >> Eo), this pseudo-steady\nstate will be achieved before there is perceptible transformation of substrate into product.\nIn this case the equation [I.5] leads to the traditional Michaelis-Menten equation, which\npredicts the initial turnover rate of the enzymatic reaction vo as a function of initial\nsubstrate concentration So:\nv\nS\nv =\nmax\no\n[I.6]\no\nK + S\nm\no\nwhere the constant Km = (k-1+k2)/kl is called the Michaelis constant and vmax = k2Eo is the\nmaximum turn-over rate. The Michaelis constant has units of concentration and reflects\nthe affinity of the reaction. Strong affinity means small Km. At a concentration Km the\nturn-over rate is 0.5vmax (Fig. 2).\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nFigure 1.\nThe time dependence of the substrate, enzyme, enzyme-substrate complex,\nand product concentration.

We found that the\ntraditional form of the Michaelis-Menten equation [I.6] is derived by assuming a quasi-\nsteady state in which the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex is fairly constant\nover time. Additionally we had to assume that initially the substrate is in excess. In this\nSection, we first will take a step back and focus on the steady state behavior of reversible\nreactions and introduce the concept of multiple binding sites. Initially we will consider\nmultiple binding sites that are independently binding substrates. However for most\nprotein complexes the binding of substrates is not independent. For example, after\nbinding the first substrate molecule the binding probability of the second substrate is\naffected. This phenomenon is called cooperativity.\nIn the previous section it was assumed that one substrate molecule binds to one enzyme\nmolecule. In biological reactions however proteins often bind multiple substrates.\nAssume a protein has n binding sites for a substrate. Pj denotes the protein bound to j\nsubstrate molecules S. The reactions describing this process are:\nS + Pj 1\n- ↔ Pj\n[II.1]\nwhere j = 1, 2, ..., n.\nThe time-evolution of the concentration of unbound protein Po is (j=1):\nd[P ] -\n= k+ 1\n][S]\n[P\n+ k [P ]\n[II.2]\ndt\no\n- 1\nwhere k+1 and k-1 are the forward and backward rate constants of [II.1] for j=1. The\nassociation and dissociation constants are defined as:\nk+ 1\nK =\na\nk 1\n-\n[II.3]\nk 1\n-\n=\n=\nKd\nk+ 1\nKa\nIn steady state, d[Po]/dt = 0:\nK = [P ]\n[II.4]\na\n][S]\n[P o\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nTo characterize all n reactions, we introduce the n association constants Kj, j = 1, 2, ... ,n.\nK j =\n[Pj]\n[II.5]\n][S]\n[P j 1\n-\nIt is experimentally difficult to measure [Pj], a more convenient quantity is the average\nnumber r (0 < r < n) of substrates bound to the protein. Because there are j substrates\nbound to Pj, r is given by:\n[P ] + 2[P ] + 3[P ] + ... + n[P ]\n[II.6]\nn\nr =\n[P ] + [P ] + [P ] + ... + [P ]\no\nn\ncombining [II.5] and [II.6] gives Adair's equation:\nn\n[S]\nK\n+\n[S]\nK\n2K\n2 +\n[S]\nK\nK\n3K\n3 + ... +\n[S]\n...K\nK\nnK\n[II.7]\nn\nr =\nn\n1+\n[S]\nK\n+\n[S]\nK\nK\n2 + ... +\n[S]\n...K\nK\nK\nn\nNote that 0 < r < n, one often uses the normalized form, called the saturation function Y =\nr/n (0 < Y < 1).\nIdentical and independent binding sites\nFor now let's assume we have n identical binding sites and that binding at a given site is\nindependent of the state of binding of all other sites. The rate constants k+ and k-\ncharacterize the binding and unbinding rates respectively. In steady state, [II.2] can now\nbe written as:\n0 -\n=\n][S]\n[P\nnk\n+ [P\nk\n]\n[II.8]\n+\no\n-\nThe factor n takes into account that there are n possible binding sites available for\nbinding the first substrate. On the other hand there is only one possibility to loose a\nsubstrate going from state P1 to Po. Similarly for j=2 we can deduce:\n0 -\n= (n -\n][S]\n[P\n1)k\n+\n[P\n2k\n]\n[II.9]\n+\n-\nbecause there are (n-1) possibilities to add a substrate and only 2 possibilities to remove a\nsubstrate. If the intrinsic association constant K is defined as:\nK ≡ k+\n[II.10]\nk-\nwe find that K1 = nK and K2 = (n-1)K/2. In general, one can write:\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nK j = (n - j + 1)K\n[II.11]\nj\nfor j = 1, 2, ... , n. By substituting [II.11] in [II.7] an explicit equation for r as a function\nof K, n, and [S] is found. We will not go through the details of the derivation. If you are\ninterested, see for example Bisswanger (2002, p. 11-16). The final result is elegantly\nsimple:\nr = nK[S]\n[II.12]\n1+ K[S]\nNote that the mathematical form of this equation is very similar to Michaelis-Menten\nkinetics. However this result is a steady-state (equilibrium) property while Michaelis-\nMenten equation is not. Equation [II.12] can also be derived in a more hand waving\nmanner. As the n binding sites are identical and independent, it is not important to view\nthem as clustered in one protein. If [F] is the concentration of free binding site and [B]\nthe concentration of bound sites in steady state, then the association constant for this\nequilibrium is given by:\nK = [B]\n[II.13]\n[F][S]\nThe total number of sites is: n[P]=[F]+[B], this combined with [II.13] gives:\n[B]\nnK[S]\n[II.14]\nr =\n=\n[P] 1+ K[S]\nNon-identical and independent binding sites\nNow consider the case in which the binding sites are non-identical. Each binding site\nfamily (with nj binding sites) is characterized by its own association constant Kj. At low\nconcentrations first the binding sites with the high affinities will be occupied, the lower\naffinity binding site will only be occupied at larger [S]. As the binding site are\nindependent the binding equation (18) holds for each binding site family and r is just the\nsum of the different individual processes:\n[S]\nK\nn\n[S]\nK\nn\n[S]\nK\nn\n[II.15]\n+\nm\nm\nr =\n+ ... +\n1+\n[S]\nK\n1+\n[S]\nK\n1+\n[S]\nK\nm\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nIdentical and interacting binding sites\nIn the following discussion we will confine ourselves to two binding sites (n=2). First, let\nus assume that both binding sites are identical. In this case we only have to consider three\nstates for the protein-substrate complex: no substrate bound, one substrate molecule\nbound, and two substrate molecules bound. The rate constants k+ and k- characterize the\ntransitions between the unbound and single-bound state, and k*\n+ and k*\n- the transitions\nbetween single-bound and double-bound states. The intrinsic association constants are\ndefined by: K = k+/k- and K* = k*\n+/k*\n-. Analogous to [II.10] and [II.11] we find:\nK1 = 2K\n[II.16]\n=\nK2\n1K*\nBy using Adair's equation [II.7] we find:\n*\n2K[S] +\n[S]\n2KK\n[II.17]\nr =\n*\n1+ 2K[S] +\n[S]\nKK\nThe saturation function Y = r/n is:\n*\nK[S] +\n[S]\nKK\nY =\n*\n[II.18]\n1+ 2K[S] +\n[S]\nKK\nFor K=K* we recover the hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten like) equation [II.12]:\n~ = K[S]\n[II.19]\nY 1+ K[S]\nLet's compare the functional forms of [II.18] and [II.19] in more detail. The difference\nbetween the two functions is:\n~\n(K* -K)K[S]2\nY\n-\nY\n=\n)(\n*\n(1+\nK[S]\n+ 2K[S] +\n[S]\nKK\n)\n[II.20]\n~\nPositive cooperativity is often defined as Y - Y > 0 , and negative cooperativity as\n~\nY - Y < 0 . In other words, positive cooperativity occurs when the affinity of binding a\nsecond ligand is larger than binding the first ligand (K* > K). For negative cooperativity\nthe binding affinity for the second ligand is smaller than for the first (K* < K).\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nAnother, often used, definition for cooperativity is sigmoidality (from 'S shaped'). For a\nsigmoidal curve the second derivative should change sign. Let's introduce the\ndimensionless variables β = K*/K and x = K[S]:\n(1\nx + βx)\nY = 1+ 2x + βx2\ndY\n1+ 2xβ + βx2\n=\n[II.21]\n2)2\ndx\n(1+ 2x + βx\nY\nd\nβ - 2 - βx[ 3 + 3xβ + βx ]\n= 2\n2)3\ndx2\n(1+ 2x + βx\nThe second derivative can only change sign if β > 2. Note that this definition yields a\ndifferent criterion for cooperativity. According to the first definition a reaction is\ncooperative for β > 1, whereas according to the second definition β > 2. During the rest\nof the course we will use the first definition.\nNow consider the limit for which intermediate states can be neglected. In this example,\nthat would mean that single-bound states are very unlikely. The effective reaction would\nbe:\nP + 2S ↔ P2\n[II.22]\no\nThe saturation function is now:\nY = K[S]2\n[II.23]\n1+ K[S]2\nwhere K = [P2]/([Po][S]2) is the association constant of reaction [II.22]. Note that is this\ncase the units of K are (M)-2. This limit was first consider by Hill who proposed a\n[\ngraphical way to represent equations such as [II.23]. In a Hill plot one plots\nY/(1\nln\n- Y)]\nversus ln[S] . The slope of this graph is called the Hill number which is in this case\nequals 2. The Hill number is often used as an estimation of the number of binding sites\nof a protein. However one should be very careful as [II.23] involves a major assumption\n(no intermediate states). Let's calculate the Hill number nH for the case [II.21] in which\nintermediate states are allowed:\nd\nY\nd\nY\n(β - 1)x\n[II.24]\n=\n= x\n= 1+\nnH\nd(ln[S]) ln 1- Y\ndx ln 1- Y\nx)(1\n(1\n+ βx)\n+\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nThe Hill number is plotted in Fig. 3 as a function of x at different values of β. The Hill\nβ\nnumber only approaches 2 for very large and small x.\nFigure 3.\nThe Hill number as a function of the dimensionless concentration at\ndifferent values of β for a protein with two identical interacting binding\nsites. The mathematical form is given by equation [II.24].\nS\nS S\nk2+\nk2-\nk3+\nk3-\nk1+\nk1-\nk4+\nk4-\nS\nFigure 4.\nTwo independent interacting binding sites.\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nNon-identical and interacting binding sites\nHow would the analysis above change if the two binding sites are non-identical? The\nligand binding to the two binding sites is now characterized by the rate constants k±1, k±2,\nk±3, and k±4 (Fig. 4) and the four intrinsic association constants Kj=k+j/k-j (j=1,2,3,4). In\nthis case there are four states of the protein-ligand complex: nothing bound, site 1 bound,\nsite 2 bound, and two sites bound. The principal of detailed balance (thermodynamic\nequilibrium) does not allow any net fluxes between states. Therefore:\n'\nK1 = [P ] ;K = [P ] ;K = [P ] ;K = [P ]\n[II.25]\n'\n][S]\n[P\n][S]\n[P\n][S]\n[P\n][S]\n[P\no\no\nRewritting (31) gives:\nK\nK\n3 =\nK\nK\n[II.26]\nThe saturation function is given by:\n'\nY = 1\n[P ] + [P ] + 2[P ]\n][S](K\n[P\n+ K 2 ) +\n][S]K\n2[P\n⇒\n=\no\n2 [P ] + [P ] + [P'] + [P ]\n[P ] +\n](K\n[S][P\n+ K 2 ) +\n][S]K\n[P\no\no\no\n[II.27]\n[S]\nK\n+\n[S]\nK\n+\n[S]\nK\n2K\nY =\n1+\n[S]\nK\n+\n[S]\nK\n+\n[S]\nK\nK\nNote that [II.27] is independent of K4 as expected because of the detailed balance\nequation [II.26].\nIf we define\nJ = 2 (K + K 2 )\nJ* =\nK\n2K\n(K + K 2 )\n[II.28]\n'\nx = J[S]\n'\nJ*\nβ = J\nThe saturation function can be written in the same form as for the identical interacting\nbinding sites:\n'\n'\n'\n(1\nx\n+ x β )\n[II.29]\nY =\n'\n'\n1+ 2x + β x'2\n'\n'\nIn the limit K1=K2 we find x=x and β=β (identical interacting sites).

This implies that\nbinding curves exhibiting negative cooperativity could arise from a protein that has\nindependent binding sites or from a protein that has two interacting sites in which the\nsecond binding event is less likely that the first.\nFurther reading on enzyme kinetics and cooperativity\nD.

      "content": "III A Genetic Switch in Lamba Phage\nReferences:\n1.\nJ. Hasty, J. Pradines, M. Dolnik, and J. J. Collins. Noise-based switches and\namplifiers for gene expression. PNAS 97, 2075-2080 (2000).\nThe goal of this Section is to apply our knowledge of reaction kinetics and equilibrium\nbinding to a real biological problem: the lysis-lysogeny decision of the bacterial phage\nlambda. The first goal is to derive the kinetic equation [7] in Hasty's paper.\nFigure 5 schematically depicts the genetic regulation of the PRM λ promoter. The gene of\nthis promoter, called cI, encodes for a repressor protein, which in turn dimerizes and\nbinds to the DNA as a transcription factor. In this model Hasty et al. assume that binding\nto OR2 enhances transcription whereas binding to OR3 switches off transcription. Note\nthat the wild-type lambda operon has three binding sites.\nOR2\nλ\nλ\n\nλ\nλ\n\nλ\nλ\nOR2\nλ\nλ\n\nOR2\nλ\nλ\nλ\nλ\n\nK1\nK2\nOR3\nOR3\nOR3\nFigure 5.

The first four\nequations are fast reversible reactions since DNA binding and unbinding of the repressors\ndimers and the dimerization itself occur within seconds, whereas the synthesis\n(transcription, translation, folding) and degradation (e.g dilution through cell growth) of\nmonomers takes minutes to sometimes an hour. Therefore, the first four reactions are in\nequilibrium and the steady state concentrations are given in terms of the equilibrium\nconstants. This separation of time scales is an important step in simplifying the model.\nSince the first four reactions in [III.1] are in equilibrium compared to protein synthesis\nand degradation, the concentrations of the 'fast' variables are (y=[X2]; d=[D]; u=[DX2];\nv=[DX2\n*]; z=[DX2X2]):\ny =\nx\nK\nu =\ndy\nK\n=\ndx\nK\nK\n[III.2]\nv = σ\ndy\nK\n= σ\nK\nK\n2dx\nz = σ\nuy\nK\n= σ\nK\n(K\n)2dx\nWhere:\nK3\n=\nσ1\nK2\n[III.3]\nK4\n=\nσ2\nK2\nThe only slow variable is the concentration of cI monomers x=[X]. The rate of synthesis\nof repressor monomer is given by:\ndx =\nu\np\nnk\n-\nx\nk\n+ r\n[III.4]\ndt\nt\no\nd\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nwhere po is the concentration of RNA polymerase (assumed to be constant). A basal\nsynthesis rate is modeled by r. In other words the promoter is never fully off, but leaks at\na rate r. Now realizing that the total amount of lambda promoter sites dT is conserved:\ndT = d + u + v + z\n[III.5]\nThis, together with [III.2] gives:\ndT = 1\nd + (1+ σ )\nx\nK\nK\n+ σ2\nx\nK\nK\n]\n[III.6]\n[\nUsing this result [III.4] becomes:\ndx\nx\nK\nK\nd\np\nnk\n=\nt\no\nT\n-\nx\nk\n+ r\n[III.7]\nd\ndt\n1+ (1+ σ\nx\nK\n)K\n2 + σ2\nx\nK\nK\nNow the goal is to 'clean up' the ugly looking [III.7]. This is done by normalizing the\nvariables x and t. Since the product K1K2 always appears before x2 it is logical to\nintroduce a new variable:\nx = x\nK\nK1\n[III.8]\nSince the units of K1 and K2 are [1/concentration], x is dimensionless. Using this new\nvariable [III.7] reduces to:\nx\nd\nx\nd\np\nnk\nK\nK\nkd\nx + r\n[III.9]\n=\nt\no\nT\n-\nK\nK\n2 dt\n1+ (1+ σ )x2 + σ2x4\nAn additional 'clean-up' arises when the time is normalized into a dimensionless form:\n(\nt = r\nt\nK\nK1\n2 )\n[III.10]\nUsing this, gives:\nx\nd\nx\nd\np\nnk\nr\n=\nt\no\nT\n-\nK\nK\nkd\nx + r\n[III.11]\nt\nd\n1+ (1+ σ )x2 + σ2x4\nOr,\ndx\nαx2\n=\n- γx + 1\ndt\n1+ (1+ σ )x2 + σ2x4\nd\np\nnk\nα =\nt\no\nT\n[III.12]\nr\nkd\nγ =\nr\nK\nK\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nI.4 Phage lambda and multistability\nThe dimensionless parameter α is effectively a measure of the synthesis rate of monomer\nrelative to the basal level of expression. The parameter γ reflects the ratio of degradation\nof monomer relative to the basal level. Matlab code 2 solves the kinetic equation [III.12].\nNote that dependent on the initial conditions the system can have different steady state\nsolutions.\nMATLAB Code 2: Solution of equation [III.12]\n% filename: hasty.m\nalpha=50;\ngamma=20;\nsigma1=1;\nsigma2=5;\noptions=[];\n[t1 y1]=ode23('hastyfunc',[0 10],[0],options,alpha,gamma,sigma1,\nsigma2);\n[t2 y2]=ode23('hastyfunc',[0 10],[1],options,alpha,gamma,sigma1,\nsigma2);\nplot(t1,y1(:,1),'b',t2,y2(:,1),'r');\n% filename: hastyfunc.m\nfunction dydt = f(t,y,flag,alpha,gamma,sigma1,sigma2)\n% [x] = y(1)\ndydt = [alpha*y(1)^2/(1+(1+sigma1)*y(1)^2+sigma2*y(1)^4)-\ngamma*y(1)+1];\nMatlab code 2 shows that dependent on the initial conditions the steady state value that is\nreached can be different. In this specific example the system has two stable state and is\ntherefore bistable. This multistability is analyzed by doing a stability analysis. Equation\n[III.12] can be rewritten as:\ndx = f(x) - g(x)\ndt\nαx2\nf(x) =\n+ 1\n[III.13]\n1+ (1+ σ )x2 + σ2x4\ng(x) -\n= γx\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nThe functions f(x) and g(x) represent the creation and destruction terms of cI monomer.\nIn steady-state f(x)=g(x) and this relation is graphically solved (Fig. 6). For small γ there\nis only one intersection point between f(x) and g(x) reflecting one solution in the steady-\nstate (this point is called a fixed point). This is a stable fixed point since a deviation to a\nhigher value of x results in a larger destruction rate than creation (g(x)>f(x)). This means\nthat there will be a net decrease in x, pushing the deviation back to the fixed point. The\nopposite happens for a deviation of a lower x value (g(x)<f(x)). At intermediate γ there\nare 3 fixed points. Using the same strategy one finds that the outer fixed points are stable\nand the middle fixed point is unstable. A small deviation to larger x from the middle\nfixed point leads to an increased x until it reaches the upper fixed point. A small\ndeviation to a smaller x from the middle fixed point results in a decrease in x until it\nreaches the lower fixed point.\nFurther reading on phage lambda and multistability\nM. Ptashne.

Creation terms and destruction term in [III.12] as a function of time.\nFor high destruction rates (unstable cI protein) only one steady-state solution is\nfound at low values of x. At intermediate destruction rates three solutions in\nthe steady state are possible: two stable and one unstable solution. For low\ndestruction rates (stable cI protein) one steady state solution is found at a large\nx value.\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004"

      "content": "IV Synthetic genetic switches\nReference:\n1. T. S. Gardner, C. R. Cantor, and J. J. Collins. Construction of a genetic toggle switch\nin Escherichia coli. Nature 403, 339-342 (2000).\nIn this paper Gardner et al. engineered a plasmid containing two repressor genes mutually\ncontrolling each others expression. In Box 1 postulate the two equations describing the\ntoggle switch:\ndu\nα1\n=\n- u\ndt\n1+ vβ\n[IV.1]\ndv\nα2\n=\n- v\ndt\n1+ uγ\nLet's derive this equation and explore which assumptions were made during the\nderivation.

We will assume that there is only one binding site for the\nrepressor (in contrast to the lambda phage promoters). However the repressor monomers\ncan form multimers. Repressor 1 multimerizes with γ subunits and repressor 2 with β\nsubunits. Note that K3 and K4 are the effective association constants for multimerization.\nThe units of K3 and K4 are (M)1-γ and (M)1-β respectively. The last two equations assume\nthat intermediate states are not allowed. This is the Hill approximation as we discussed\nbefore (see for example [II.22]). Remember that the total number of promoter site is\nconserved, and the total concentration of both promoters is identical since they are on the\nsame plasmid:\n[PT] = [PT] = [P ] +\nR\n[P\nβ ] = [PT] = [P ] +\nR\n[P\nγ ]\n[IV.3]\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nNow the rate of synthesis of repressor 1 and 2 can be written as:\n[P\nk\nT]\n[P ]\n= [P\nk\nT]\n=\nRgen1 = [P\nk\nT][P ] +\nR\n[P\nβ ]\n1+\n[R\nK\nβ ]\n1+\n[R\nK\nK\n]β\n[IV.4]\n[P\nk\nT]\n[P ]\n=\n[P\nk\nT]\n=\nRgen2 =\n[P\nk\nT][P ] +\nR\n[P\nγ ]\n1+\n[R\nK\nγ ]\n1+\n[R\nK\nK\n]γ\nThe rates k1 and k2 are the effective synthesis rates (including RNA polymerase binding,\ntranscription, translation, and folding) of repressor protein 1 and 2, respectively).\nAssuming a first order decay process with rate δ, the kinetic equations are:\nd[R ]\n[P\nk\nT]\n- δ[R ]\n1 =\ndt\n1+\n[R\nK\nK\n]β\n[IV.5]\nd[R ] =\n[P\nk\nT]\n- δ[R ]\ndt\n1+\n[R\nK\nK\n]γ\n~\nWhen we introduce a dimensionless time t = tδ , equation (50) becomes:\nd[R ]\n[P\nk\nT]\n- [R ]\n1 =\nt\nd ~\nδ 1+\n[R\nK\nK\n]β\n[IV.6]\nd[R ]\n[P\nk\nT]\n- [R ]\n2 =\nt\nd ~\nδ 1+\n[R\nK\nK\n]γ\nif we use the following dimensionless concentrations:\n1/γ\nu =\nK\n](K\n[R\n)\n[IV.7]\n1/β\nv =\nK\n](K\n[R\n)\nEquation [IV.6] becomes:\nT\n1/γ\ndu\nK\n](K\n[P\nk\n3)\n- u\n=\nt\nd\nδ\n1+ vβ\n[IV.8]\nT\n1/β\n~\ndv\nK\n](K\n[P\nk\n4)\n- v\n=\nt\nd\nδ\n1+ uγ\nFinally by defining α1 and α2 as:\n~\nT\n1/γ\nα1 ≡\nK\n](K\n[P\nk\n)\nδ\n[IV.9]\nT\n1/β\nα2 ≡\nK\n](K\n[P\nk\n)\nδ\nwe recover the 'Box' equation:\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\ndu\nα1\n~ =\n- u\nt\nd\n1+ vβ\n[IV.10]\ndv\nα2\n~ =\n- v\nt\nd\n1+ uγ\nIn steady state both these equations equal zero:\nα1\nu = 1+ vβ\n[IV.11]\nα2\nv = 1+ uγ\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nV Stability analysis\nConsider the following two coupled differential equations:\nf (x , y )\nx\ny\nThe nullclines are defined as:\n&\n&\n=\n[V.1]\n( , )\ng x y\n=\n0 → f (x , y ) = 0\no\no\nx\ny\nin order to solve [V.2] we linearize around the fixed point (xo,yo):\n~x ≡ x - x o\n~\n[V.3]\ny ≡ y - y o\nIf f(x,y) and g(x,y) are approximated by a first order Taylor expansion, [V.2] can be\nwritten as:\n&\n&\n=\n[V.2]\n(\n,\n)\no\ng x y\n= →\n=\no\n~ ∂ f\n~ ∂ f\n~\nx ≈ x\n+ y\n≡ x\na ~ + y\nb\nx\ny\n&\n∂\n∂\n(\n,\n)\n(\n,\n)\nx y\nx y\no\no\n[V.4]\no\no\n~ ∂ g\n~ ∂ g\n~\ny ≈ x\n+ y\n≡ x\nc ~ + y\nd\ny\n&\n∂\n∂\nx (\n,\n)\n(\n,\n)\nx y\nx y\no\no\no\no\nor in matrix notation:\nX = X\nA\nr\n&\na\nb\nr\nA = c\n\nd\nr\n&\n\nX\n\n&\n&\nx\ny\n~\nx\n[V.5]\n=\nr\nX = ~\ny\n\nThe matrix A is characterized by its trace and the determinant:\nτ = trace ( A ) = a + d\n[V.6]\n=\n∆ det( A ) = ad - bc\nLet's try to find a solution of the convenient form:\nv\nv\nv&v = λ v = v\nA\n[V.7]\n7.81/8.591/9.531 Systems Biology - A. van Oudenaarden - MIT- September 2004\n\nThis vector is called the eigenvector, λ is the corresponding eigenvalue.
