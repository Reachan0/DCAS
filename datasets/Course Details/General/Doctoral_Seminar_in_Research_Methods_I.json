Sorensen\n\nCourse Overview\n\nThis course is designed to lay the foundations of good empirical research in the social sciences. It does not deal with specific techniques per se, but rather with the assumptions and the logic underlying social research. Students become acquainted with a variety of approaches to research design, and are helped to develop their own research projects and to evaluate the products of empirical research.\n\nStudents will work in groups to design and carry out a small research project. Group results will be presented orally to the class at various points during the semester, with a final public presentation that will be open to the Sloan community. A group written report is due at the end of the semester. There will also be 2 individual assignments.\n\nTextbook\n\nOne text is available at the bookstore and also on reserve in the library:\n\nSingleton, R. A., Jr., and Bruce C.

      "content": "Group Project\nIn scholarly communities, the significance of a piece of research is judged by the extent\nto which it advances existing knowledge about a particular theoretical process or\nempirical phenomenon, or establishes a new line of inquiry. As a step toward developing\nthe skills necessary for making a scholarly contribution, the main assignment in the\ncourse is design a small research project to be carried out during the semester.\nThe research project should be conceived as a (potential) contribution to an existing body\nof research. As first-year students, you are of course unlikely to be deeply familiar with\nexisting bodies of research. We will therefore provide several (short) reading lists that\nhighlight some central pieces of argument and evidence in a particular line of work. The\nparticular research question that you choose to pursue is up to the group. You are not\nobligated to restrict yourself to the reading lists that we provide. However, in designing\nthe research project, you are required to define how the research might contribute to an\nexisting body of knowledge.\nAfter deciding on a research question, you then need to decide how you are going to go\nabout gathering the data you need to answer the question. Then you have to find a source\nof data to carry out your research. This could involve collecting original data from any\nsetting, e.g., a class, a store, a committee, a community organization. You may also use\nan already existing data set if you do so creatively. Finally you need to analyze your data\nand write up your results.\nThe project is meant to be small in two ways. First, you must design the project so that it\nis doable in this semester. Second, it will not be necessary to do a full literature review:\nyou can also use your experience, things you've read in other classes, your hunches, etc.,\nto give context to your project.\nDoing a project in a group has both advantages and disadvantages. Working in a group\nmeans that time needs to be spent up front to get to know each other, understand the task,\nand decide how to proceed. On the other hand, having a number of people can ease the\nassignment by dividing initial responsibilities and tasks. Note, however, that this is a\ngroup product and will be graded in that way.\nThe timing is guided by the presentations in class:\nOctober 7\nResearch proposal reports - here each group will describe to the\nclass the question they want to investigate and the way they think they will go\nabout getting data; this is a good occasion to get help from the class in\nformulating a final design\nNote: prior to this first report, each group needs to make an out-of-class\nappointment to go over their preliminary ideas\nNovember 18 Progress reports - each group will report on their progress - again\n\nthis is a chance to get help from the class\nDecember 4 Final public group reports - each group will\ngive a final formal presentation on their research project\nDecember 11 final written group report is due"
