  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nTexts\n\nAs a supplement to material in the class notes, there is a\nrequired\ntext for the course: Costanzo, Linda S.\nPhysiology\n. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, PA: W.B. Saunders, 2002. ISBN: 9780721695495. This is a basic reference for the material to be covered.\n\nAn alternative text is\nrecommended\nfor students desiring a more comprehensive reference: Berne, R. M., and M. N. Levy.\nPhysiology\n. 5th ed. St. Louis, MO: Mosby, 2003. ISBN: 9780323022255.\n\nQuizzes\n\nThere are three quizzes. Each quiz will count 15% of the final grade for the course.\n\nFinal Exam\n\nThere will be a final examination, which will count 35% of the course grade.\n\nHome Problems\n\nA total of 10 home problem sets will be assigned. Periodic home problem sets will be assigned. Problem sets will be posted on the web site; no hard copies will be handed out. Students are expected to do the problems and hand in their solutions, which will be reviewed and returned. Performance on homework will count 10% toward the final grade. Please hand in your best effort on time (before the answers are provided). But remember, there is an enormous difference between a partially successful attempt, and no attempt at all! You get a zero for no homework, but will get up to 50% of full credit even if late.\n\nLaboratory Exercises\n\nThere are 6 laboratory exercises in the course, each lasting approximately 3 hours, except where noted. (Lab 3 consists of three individual sessions.) These include:\n\nLab 1: Anatomy of the Heart\n\nLab 2: Electrophysiology of the Frog Heart (write-up required)\n\nLab 3: Mammalian Circulation: (write-up required)\n\nOrientation Discussion (Orientation discussion takes 3 hours)\n\nLaboratory (Lab is a day-long activity)\n\nDiscussion of Results (Discussion of results takes 3 hours)\n\nLab 4: Pulmonary Modeling\n\nLab 5: Life-saving Cardiovascular Technology: Case Presentation\n\nLab 6: Graduate Student Symposium and Dinner\n\nThis course includes two animal labs (Labs 2 and 3). The first demonstrates cardiac electrophysiology and the second focuses on cardiovascular hemodynamics and control. These laboratory experiences are of great importance to the objectives of the course, and teach both complex physiology and also experimental technique. They cannot be replaced by textbooks or mathematical simulation. All students are expected to participate in these labs.\n\nLaboratory Reports\n\nLab reports are required for laboratory exercises. We expect the lab reports to be written neatly and concisely. Each student submits a report, although a group may collaborate in data analysis. The standards by which we judge the lab reports are based upon:\n\nAdequate, clear record of your experimental procedures. It is not necessary to repeat material already described in the hand-outs!\n\nA brief but accurate description of your experimental results. Explain and show what you measured in lab, and make note of any problems, difficulties, or characteristics in the data that may be useful later in making interpretations (noisy signals, instabilities, etc.). Copies of actual data should be included whenever possible. You may make a (xerox) copy of the data (only) from your partner's notebook and include the copy in your notebook.\n\nSuccinct discussions of your results. Use the literature to help you interpret what you measured. Think hard about what happened, and then write the number of words necessary to convey your interpretation.\n\nPlease record the names of those you worked with in each experiment.\n\nReports are due not later than one week after your lab period (unless otherwise established by the staff), and should be handed in to the teaching assistant.\n\nLate reports are unacceptable, except in emergency situations for which arrangements have been worked out in advance with the teaching assistant. In some experiments, the lab staff will want to look at your data before you leave the laboratory to be sure that you got something reasonable with which to work. Note: Lab reports are required in order to complete the course and are worth 10% of the final grade. Every year one or two students forget this point and end up getting \"incompletes\" for grades. Don't be one of them!\n\nGrades\n\nIn summary, the final grade will be assessed on the following basis:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nHomework\n\n10%\n\nQuiz #1\n\n15%\n\nQuiz #2\n\n15%\n\nQuiz #3\n\n15%\n\nLabs\n\n10%\n\nFinal Exam\n\n35%\n\nCourse Ethics\n\nHomework Exercises\n\nHomework Exercises are designed primarily to help you to learn. You may do them alone, or you may work with others. You may make use of all available reference material. If you work together with other student(s) you should formally recognize that fact in writing. For example, \"This problem was solved jointly by myself and ______________.\" This policy is completely consistent with all scientific writing, and recognizes joint efforts. Note that collaboration on homework does not in any way detract from your own credit. On the other hand, undeclared collaboration is not ethical.\n\nLaboratory Reports\n\nEach student must submit his/her individual write-up. Data should be duplicated. Group discussions of results are encouraged. Your report should indicate the composition of your research group.",

The fistula may have a very low resistance to fluid flow, and may carry large blood\nflow rates.\nFigure 1:\nTwo medical students were arguing about the expected effect of a large femoral AV fistula on\nthe blood supply to the leg. One student was certain that the leg would be deprived of its blood\nsupply and would become gangrenous. The other student violently disagreed, and insisted that the\nleg would be in no danger. Who was correct?\nA. Propose a simple resistive model to represent the blood supply to the leg with and without\nthe presence of the fistula. The model should include the aorta, the femoral artery, the leg\ncirculation, and the corresponding veins. Assume that the resistance of the fistula (when\nopen) is much lower than the resistance of the leg vascular bed, but higher than the (negli\ngible) resistance of the aorta. Assume negligible resistance for the large veins as well as the\naorta. Assume the aortic pressure, P0, is constant. The following variables may be used to\nmodel the system:\nRA : Large Artery Resistance\nRL : Leg Resistance\nRF : Fistula Resistance\n(venous resistance is\nnegligible)\nP0: Constant Pressure Source\n(due to baroreceptor reflexes)\nPL : Pressure above Leg\nResistance\nand Fistula Resistance\nQT : Cardiac Output (Total Flow)\nQF : Fistula Flow\nQL : Leg Flow\n6.022j--2004: Solutions to Problem Set 1\n\nB. Calculate the blood flow to the leg with and without the fistula, and referee the argument.\nExpress your answers in terms of resistances and aortic pressure. Determine the ratio:\n(Blood flow to the leg with the fistula)\n(Blood flow to the leg without the fistula)\nand plot this ratio as a function of relevant resistances, RA .\nRF\nC. What will be the change in cardiac output when the fistula opens?

A left-sided cath study was performed, complete with bi-plane cine ventriculograms\n(X-ray movies of the ventricle obtained in orthogonal projections following injection of radio-\nopaque dye into the ventricle). It was discovered that the patient had a significant amount of blood\nin the pericardial cavity (between the heart and the pericardial sac). Three hundred milliliters of\nblood were removed and the patient improved considerably.\nAs part of the evaluation procedure, diastolic pressure-volume curves for the left ventricle were\nmeasured both before and after the pericardial tap (removal of the pericardial blood). (This was\ndone by simultaneous measurement of LV volume from the cine data, and of the LV pressure from\nand intracardiac pressure transducer.) These curves are presented in Figure 1.\nFigure 2A shows the LV and aortic pressures recorded prior to removal of the pericardial blood.\nFigure 2B shows these pressures after removal when the cardiovascular system had reached steady\nstate. At the time indicated by the arrow, a balloon was suddenly inflated in the ascending aorta\n(see Figure 3), which presented an increased afterload to the left ventricle. Note that the aortic\npressure was measured proximal to (on the heart side of) the balloon. The added pressure load was\nsudden, and compensatory mechanisms did not have time to act for several beats. Thus, the heart's\ncontractile state may be considered constant for 10-15 seconds, and this period certainly includes\nbeats numbered 3, 4, and 5 in the figure.\nAdditional data gathered during the work-up included:\nA. Fick data during steady state before the pericardium was drained:\nO2 uptake\n300 cc/min.\nArterial O2 content\n180 cc/liter\nMixed venous O2 content 80 cc/liter\nB. Individual stroke volumes during the balloon test are indicated in Figure 2B.

This\ndevice may be life-saving in situations where the heart muscle has been weakened by disease (such\nas loss of blood supply).\nOne possible design for the IABP is shown in Figure 4. It consists of a long, thin, inflatable\nballoon which is inserted via the femoral artery to the aortic arch. It may be in one of two states:\ndeflated with an internal pressure of zero, or inflated at an internal pressure PB . By appropri\nate timing of the two states, considerable improvement may result in circulatory function. The\npressure-volume characteristics of the aorta with the balloon both deflated and inflated are shown\nin Figure 5.\nThe heart and peripheral circulation may be modeled as shown in Figure 6. The left ventricle\nis represented by a time-varying capacitor C(t ) driven by a constant filling pressure, Pf . The\nperipheral circulation is represented by the Windkessel approximation where the pressure/volume\nrelationships of Ca are shown in Figure 5. (Ca is a 2-state device.) Assume that the systolic\nejection time is very short, dt .\nA. What must be the timing of the balloon inflation/deflation sequence in order to assist the\nheart? Plot the required switching function f (t ) on the same time axis as C(t ).\nNote: f (t ) is defined in Figure 4, and C(t ) in Figure 6.\nThe balloon should be inflated during diastole; it must be deflated during ventricular systole.\nFor aortic volumes less than 200 cc, the active balloon/aorta system behaves as a pressure\nsource, driving blood through the periphery at a uniform rate. The balloon should not be in\nflated during systole, because it would present an increased afterload to the damaged heart.\nWhen inflated at the end of ventricular systole, the balloon provides a boost of pressure to\nincrease overall flow through the periphery. During systole, the balloon should be deflated,\nthus lowering aortic pressure (the afterload to the LV).\nB. Indicate on Figure 5 the pressure-volume cycle followed in the aorta\n(i) with the balloon assist device inoperative, and\n(ii) with the assist device operating as defined by you in the previous question.\n6.022j--2004: Solutions to Problem Set 2\n\nSee Figure 5. Note that the balloon reduces the afterload but increases the stroke volume.\nC. Using graphical techniques, indicate on Figure 5 the area representing the net energy sup\nplied to the circulation by the balloon device per cycle.\nSee Figure 5. The shaded area represents the work done by the balloon pump per cycle.\nD.

A representative LV pressure-volume loop for a damaged heart is shown in Figure 7.

To evaluate\nthe short and long-term effects, you produce an experimental increase in LV afterload by making\na stricture in the aorta using a ligature as shown in Figure 8. (This is sometimes referred to as\n\"banding\".) Assume the animal's heart is paced at 60 beats per minute.\nFigure 8:\nPlease answer the following:\nA. The control pressures in the LV and proximal aorta are shown in Figure 9. The LV end-\ndiastolic volume was measured to be 140 cc. The cardiac output was 4,800 cc/min. From\nthis data, construct the LV P-V loop using the axes provided in Figure 11.\nHR = 60 bpm → S.V. = CO/HR = 80 cc\nsystolic = 120 mmHg; diastolic = 70 mmHg; end systolic = 110 mmHg\nLVEDP = 10\nLVEDV = 140, LVESV = 60\n→\nB. A few seconds after placing the ligature, the pressure tracings changed as shown in Figure 10.\nThe LV end-diastolic pressure was measured to be 20 mmHg. The cardiac output decreased\nonly slightly to 4500 cc/min. From the data provided, construct the new LV P-V loop on the\naxes of Figure 11.\n6.022j--2004: Solutions to Problem Set 2\n\nLVEDP = 20\nLVEDV = 190\n→\nSV = 4500 = 75 cc\nLVESV = 115\n→\nBP = 230/140\nend syst. = 220\nC.

How should the lumped parameter model of the systemic circulation be modified to account\nfor the ligature?

Over time, the heart adapts to its new pressure load by adding new muscle mass and changing\nits shape. The principle which appears to govern the adaptation is to maintain the same\nsystolic wall stress (force per unit area) as in the control state, while also maintaining a\nconstant stroke volume.\n(i) What is the relationship between the LV wall stress, σ, and the LV pressure, P?

Cardiac output also\nreturns to its control level of 4800 cc/min. Assuming that the diastolic properties of the\nLV do not change, sketch the new \"compensated\" P-V loop on Figure 11.

The ventricular pressure-volume relationships have been helpful in documenting the\ncardiac cycle in both transient and steady states. The cardiac output curve has been a convenient\nway to represent the average performance of the \"heart-lung pumping unit\". The venous return\ncurve has been used to represent the peripheral circulation. In this question you are asked to\nindicate the qualitative changes in each of the curves which would occur as a result of different\ninterventions. Sketch your answers directly on the normal curves supplied for your reference. In\neach case: (1) assume there are NO extrinsic control mechanisms operating, and (2) indicate the\nsteady state response, after the entire C.V. system has adapted to the imposed change. (The CV\nSimulator may be used as a \"reference\" if you wish, to test your predictions.

A few seconds after placing the ligature, the pressure tracings changed as shown in Figure 10.\nThe LV end-diastolic pressure was measured to be 20 mmHg. The cardiac output decreased\nonly slightly to 4500 cc/min. From the data provided, construct the new LV P-V loop on the\naxes of Figure 11.\nC. Assume that the inotropic state of the heart had not changed in the few seconds following\naortic banding. Draw the end-systolic PV curve, and calculate the LV systolic capacitance,\nCs.\n6.022j--2004: Problem Set 2\n\nD. How should the lumped parameter model of the systemic circulation be modified to account\nfor the ligature? Propose and briefly justify an alternative model for the circulation which\ntakes account of the ligature.\nE. Over time, the heart adapts to its new pressure load by adding new muscle mass and changing\nits shape. The principle which appears to govern the adaptation is to maintain the same\nsystolic wall stress (force per unit area) as in the control state, while also maintaining a\nconstant stroke volume.\n(i) What is the relationship between the LV wall stress, σ, and the LV pressure, P? (You\nmay assume a spherical LV of radius, r , and wall thickness, h.)\n(ii) What is the wall stress (in dynes/cm2) at end systole during the control state? Assume\nthe wall thickness to be 0.8 cm at end-systole.\n(iii) As a result of the heart's compensation, the end-diastolic filling pressure falls back\nto its original control value despite the continued high afterload. Cardiac output also\nreturns to its control level of 4800 cc/min. Assuming that the diastolic properties of the\nLV do not change, sketch the new \"compensated\" P-V loop on Figure 11. Draw the\nend-systolic P-V curve. Assume the aortic blood pressure is the same as in Figure 10.\n(iv) What is the LV systolic capacitance of the compensated heart?\n(v) Based on the data provided, what would be the end-systolic wall thickness of the \"com\npensated\" heart?\n6.022j--2004: Problem Set 2\n\nFigure 9:\nP (mmHg)\nTime (sec)\nFigure 10:\nP (mmHg)\nTime (sec)\n6.022j--2004: Problem Set 2\n\nFigure 11:\nP (mmHg)\nVolume (cc)\n2004/226\n6.022j--2004: Problem Set 2\n\nProblem 4\nWe have used several graphic techniques to represent the function of the heart and peripheral\ncirculation. The ventricular pressure-volume relationships have been helpful in documenting the\ncardiac cycle in both transient and steady states. The cardiac output curve has been a convenient\nway to represent the average performance of the \"heart-lung pumping unit\".

In this question you are asked to\nindicate the qualitative changes in each of the curves which would occur as a result of different\ninterventions.

It is considered clinically significant due to the possibility of developing\nmore serious ventricular ectopic rhythm.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\n6.022j--2004: Solutions to Problem Set 4\n\nC. This is, on first inspection, sinus rhythm with APBs, one of which is conducted aberrantly\nwith a classical RBBB pattern. Closer inspection of the P-wave morphology, however, sug\ngests varying P-wave shapes and hence a wandering atrial pacemaker as the underlying\nrhythm rather than straight NSR. The patient might be aware of some palpitations due to the\nectopic beats. (The beat following the pause will be more forceful due to increased filling\ntime.)\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\nD. This is supraventricular tachycardia at rates of about 230 bpm. The ladder diagram shows\nthe mechanism to be re-entrant process in the AV junction. (P-waves are not easy to identify\nwithout ambiguity.) At such a rapid heart rate, the patient would experience symptoms\ndue to inadequate C.O. (insufficient diastolic filling time). There would be lightheadedness,\npossibly syncope, possibly CHF, S.O.B., pulmonary edema, chest pain, etc.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\n6.022j--2004: Solutions to Problem Set 4\n\nE. This is an agonal rhythm. There is complete heart block, with ventricular escape rhythm\nof only 15/min. This HR is probably inadequate to maintain BP and perfusion of vital or\ngans. Patient would probably be unconscious, in shock, and would die unless rate could be\nincreased by chronotropic drugs (atropine, isuprel) or pacing.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\nF. This is low nodal rhythm. The HR is about 50 bpm, and should maintain adequate C.O. and\nBP, and would probably cause no symptoms.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\n6.022j--2004: Solutions to Problem Set 4\n\nG. This is second degree heart block of Mobitz I (Wenkebach) type. The average heart rate is\nadequate, and the patient may experience only palpitations following the dropped beats. It\nis also possible that no symptoms would occur.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\nH. This is atrial tachycardia (atrial rate = 200) with 4:1 heart block (ventricular rate = 50).\nThe origin of the rhythm is not the SA node, but probably is a re-entrant mechanism within\nthe AV junction. The heart rate is adequate for normal C.O. and BP, and the patient would\nprobably be asymptomatic.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\n6.022j--2004: Solutions to Problem Set 4\n\nI. This is ventricular fibrillation. Ladder diagram is not really possible. There is no syn\nchronous cardiac contraction, and no cardiac output. The patient would lose consciousness\nin 10-15 seconds, and die within minutes unless rhythm corrected.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\nJ. The underlying rhythm is uncertain since P-waves are not clearly seen. It could be atrial\nfibrillation since the HR is slightly irregular, or a mid-nodal rhythm. There is one VPB, and\nthen a run of ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 210 bpm. The ventricular tachycardia\nwould probably cause a drop in C.O. and BP, with symptoms of palpitations, lightheaded-\nness/dizziness, and possibly syncope. If it continues for a long time, deterioration to ventric\nular fibrillation is possible.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\n2004/178\n6.022j--2004: Solutions to Problem Set 4\n\nProblem 2\nThe following hypothetical experiments are carried out on an anesthetized rabbit with intact car\ndiovascular reflexes.\nA.

He was found to\nbe pale, with cool, moist skin, dilated pupils, a pulse rate of 150 bpm (weak and thready), a blood\npressure of 60/30, in a semicomatose state, with very little urine output. Two possible causes for\nthe low blood pressure were considered:\n- inadequate cardiac output because of damage to the left ventricle.\n- severe internal blood loss--possibly due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm.\nA. What single pressure measurement (preferably one that can be estimated by non-invasive\ninspection) would differentiate between the two diagnoses? Explain why, using CO/VR\ncurves.\nLeft atrial filling pressure is probably the most accurate choice, since it would differentiate\nclearly the condition of the LV. It is difficult to measure and is invasive, however. A second\nchoice would be the right atrial pressure, and this measurement may be estimated by the\nnon-invasive assessment of the jugular venous pressure.

Show from physical arguments (or otherwise) that the shear rate is independent of r . (Hint:\nvφ = A(r )z.) Explain how this viscometer can be used to construct the stress-strain relationship\nof a non-Newtonian fluid like blood, when the torque T on the cone and the angular speed ω are\nknown.\nFigure 1:\nR\nz\nT\nω\nr\nIn order to construct a flow curve for the unknown fluid we must measure both the shear rate\nand the shear stress of the fluid.

The cone angle, θ, is very small, so we make the following approximations:\ntan θ ≈ sin θ ≈ θ;\ncos θ ≈ 1;\nR cos θ ≈ R\nThe angular velocity ω should tell us about shear rate. Let us consider a band of fluid at a\ndistance r from the center that is dr wide and h high.

Each mechanical heartbeat is triggered by an\naction potential which originates from a rhythmic, pacemaker cell within the heart. The impulse is\nthen conducted rapidly throughout the organ in order to produce coordinated contraction.\nDisturbances in the heart's electrical activity may cause significant abnormalities in its mechanical\nfunction, and are the basis of much cardiac morbidity and mortality. In fact, malfunction of the\nheart's electrical behavior is the principal cause of sudden cardiac death. This chapter will discuss\ncardiac electrophysiology beginning at the cellular level. We will then explore the anatomy and\nelectrophysiology of the cardiac conduction system, and the normal sequence of myocardial\ndepolarization. Finally, we will relate the electrical activity of the myocardium to body surface\npotentials using the simple dipole model.\nELECTROPHYSIOLOGY OF MYOCARDIAL CELLS\n1.1 The Cardiac Action Potential\nCardiac transmembrane potentials may be recorded by means of microelectrodes. A typical\nresting potential in a ventricular muscle fiber is -80 to-90 millivolts with respect to surrounding\nextracellular fluid, similar to that found in nerve and skeletal muscle. The shape of the cardiac action\npotential, however, is quite distinctive primarily because of its long duration. A typical action\npotential from a ventricular cell is diagrammed in Fig. 1. Its total duration may be 200-300\nmilliseconds (in contrast to 1 or 2 milliseconds for nerve and skeletal muscle), and it consists of 5\ndistinct phases. The initial rapid upstroke (phase 0) from the resting potential to a positive value of\nabout +20 millivolts is similar to the spikes of other cells. Early repolarization (phase 1) brings the\npotential down to a plateau level over 2 to 3 milliseconds. The plateau itself (phase 2) follows, and\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\naccounts for most of the action potential duration. Repolarization (phase 3) brings the potential\nback to the resting level. The period between action potentials (phase 4) is stable except in cells\nwhich have the property of autorhythmicity, which will be discussed later.\nA cardiac action potential, once started in a cell, propagates by local current spread as in\nother excitable cells.\nFigure 1 - A Typical Action Potential from a Ventricular Myocardial Cell\n1.2 The Ionic Basis for the Cellular Potentials\nThe ionic basis for the cardiac action potential has features which are similar to those of\nnerve and skeletal muscle (Katz, 1966), but there are important differences also (Noble, 1979).\nCardiac cells maintain gradients of various ions across their membranes by energy-requiring\npumps. Table 1 shows representative concentrations of several important ionic species for the cat\nheart.\n+20\n-90\nTime (msec)\nMembrane potential (mV)\nCardiac muscle.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nThe cell membrane is semi-permeable, and contains a number of functionally independent\n\"channels\" through which different ions flow.\nFig. 2 is a circuit representation of a unit area of cell membrane showing channels for the\nimportant ionic species of sodium, potassium, and calcium. The fourth pathway represents all other\nionic species. Each channel has a specific ionic conductance (which may vary with membrane\npotential or time) and an equilibrium potential for the relevant ion. The membrane capacitance is\nrepresented by Cm. The total current density flowing across the membrane is Jm, and in general is\ncarried by a mixture of several ionic species. The overall net transmembrane potential is Vm. The\nflow of the ith ionic species is determined by the conductivity of its channel, gi, and its equilibrium\npotential, Vi which is given by the Nernst equilibrium equation:\nTable 1 - Ion Concentrations and Equilibrium Potentials in Cat Heart\n(From Honig, Carl R., Modern Cardiovascular Pathophysiology, Little Brown and Co., 1981, p. 18)\n\nConcentrations (MEq/L)\n\nIon\n\nOutside\n\nInside\nEquilibrium Potential\n(mV)\nNa+\n+40\nK+\n5.3\n-90\nCa++\n5.2\n.00007*\n+205\nCl-\n-28\n\n*Ca++ is too low to measure.

The\npermeability of the channels may be quite different for different ionic species, and in addition the\npermeability may be changed dramatically as a function of the potential difference across the\nmembrane, or as a result of the activation of membrane receptors.\nFigure 2 - Circuit Model of a Unit Area of Cell Membrane\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFrom the circuit of Fig. 2 we have the following expression for the membrane current\ndensity Jm:\nJm = Cm\ndVm\ndt\n+\ngi Vm -Vi\n(\n)\ni∑\n(3)\nwhere Cm is the membrane capacitance, Vm is the transmembrane potential, and gi is the membrane\nconductance for the ionic species, i.\nPhase 4 - Resting Potential\nThe resting potential (phase 4) in non-pacemaker cardiac cells is established by the same\nmechanisms as for other excitable cells. Referring to the model during the resting state\n(dVm/dt = 0), and assuming no externally applied current, we have Jm = 0. Solving eq. (3) for the\nresultant potential, we have\nVm\n0 = gK\ngm\nVK + gNa\ngm\nVNa + gCa\ngm\nVCa + g0\ngm\nV0\n(4)\nwhere\ngm =\ngi\ni∑\nand Vm\n0 is the resting potential. In the resting state the cell membrane is much more permeable to\npotassium than to the other ions, hence gK/gm ≈1. As a result, the resting potential is close to VK:\ntypically -80 to -90 mV in ventricular myocardial cells.\n1.2.2 Phase 0 -- Depolarization\nThe ionic mechanism underlying phase 0 depolarization in most cardiac muscle cells is\nsimilar to that of nerve and skeletal muscle--namely a rapid (and transient) regenerative increase in\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nsodium conductance, gNa to values almost two orders of magnitude greater than peak gK or gCa.\nThis permits the membrane potential to shift toward the sodium equilibrium potential (+40 mV).\nThe fact that the action potential never reaches VNa reflects the residual permeability of the\nmembrane to potassium. It has been shown that phase 0 is also accompanied by a fall in potassium\nconductance, with much slower kinetics. (See Fig. 3.)\nIt has been demonstrated that there is a second important inward (depolarizing) current\nwhich is activated by depolarization of the cell. This current is not sensitive to variations in\nextracellular sodium concentration, but is very sensitive to extracellular calcium concentration. The\nkinetics of this second current are very sluggish, both during activation and inactivation. This so-\ncalled \"slow inward current\" is carried primarily by calcium ions and plays an important role in the\nactivation of mechanical contraction. Most cardiac cells utilize both fast and slow currents. Fig. 4\npresents a hypothetical representation of the fast (Na+) and slow (Ca++) components of the\ncardiac action potential. (Notice that the slow inward current is the primary determinant of the phase\n2 plateau.)\nIt is possible to selectively disable one or the other of the two inward channels. The sodium\nchannel may be inactivated by partially depolarizing the membrane to about -60 mV. This channel\nmay also be selectively blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX), a poison derived from the Japanese puffer\nfish. With the sodium channel blocked, cells will exhibit the slow response only, although\nsympathomimetic amines such as epinephrine or isoproternol may be required to stimulate the slow\nchannel sufficiently to generate action potentials. Fig. 5 shows action potentials of the \"slow\nresponse\" type in Purkinje cells whose sodium channels were inactivated by increasing doses of\ntetrodotoxin (in the presence of epinephrine).\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFigure 3 - Changes in ionic conductances during the cardiac action potential.\nThe typical action potential is shown (top), with the corresponding changes in conductance for potassium (gK),\nsodium (gNa), chlorine (gCl), and calcium (gCa) (From Katz, 1977).\n+20\nhigh\nhigh\nfast channel\nhigh\nhigh\nlow\nlow\nlow\nlow\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\n-100\ngK\ngNa\ngNa\ngCl\ngCl\ngCa\ngCa\ngK\nTime (msec)\nTime (msec)\nMembrane potential (mV)\nslow channel\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Such drugs markedly reduce action potential duration,\ninhibit automaticity in the SA node, and slow conduction in the AV node.\nFigure 5 -\nProgressive blockade of INa+ in calf Purkinje fiber by increasing doses of tetrodotoxin.\nThe time course in E resembles action potentials in cells of the SA and AV nodes. The experiment was performed in\nthe presence of epinephrine, which enhances Lsi. (Modified from E. Carmeliet and J. Vereecke, Pfluegers Arch.\n313:303, 1969. From Honig, Carl R., Modern Cardiovascular Physiology 1981, Little Brown & Co., Inc. p. 26.)\nSome cells in the heart appear to lack the fast sodium channels, and function normally with\nonly the slow current mechanism. These cells are located in the sinoatrial (SA) node, and in the\natrioventricular (AV) node. Fig. 6 shows transmembrane action potentials from cells at various\nlocations in the heart's conduction system. Notice the SA and AV nodal action potentials: they\nshow the slow rise-time characteristic of the slow current. Their resting potentials are also typically\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFigure by MIT OCW. After E.

In addition, these cells conduct the action potential much more slowly\n(.01 - 0.1 meters/sec) than cells with rapid rise times (0.5 - 3.0 m/s).\nFigure 6 - The Cardiac Conduction System\nThe sketch below demonstrates the major anatomical structures of the conduction system of the heart, with typical\ntransmembrane action potentials shown on right. (Redrawn from Phillips RE, Feeney MK, 1980 The Cardiac\nRhythms. Saunders, Philadelphia and from Hoffman BF, Cranefield PF 1960 Electrophysiology of the Heart.\nMcGraw Hill, New York.)\n1.2.3 Phase l -- Repolarization\nPhase 1 repolarization, like that in nerve and skeletal muscle, is due primarily to a fall in\nsodium conductance. (See Fig. 3.)\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\n1.2.4 Phase 2 -- Plateau\nThe plateau (phase 2) is the most distinctive feature of the cardiac action potential. During\nthe plateau there is an approximate balance between inward-going calcium current and outward-\ngoing potassium current, and the membrane conductance is relatively low. The slow calcium current\nis the principal inward current during the plateau.\n1.2.5 Phase 3 -- Repolarization\nRepolarization (phase 3) is a complex process which is not completely understood. Several\nmechanisms seem to be important. First, the potassium conductance increases, tending to repolarize\nthe cell via a potassium-mediated outward current. The opening of these potassium channels is both\ntime and voltage dependent: the potassium current increases with time after the peak of the action\npotential even if Vm is held constant. On the other hand, voltage dependence is shown by the fact\nthat the potassium current can be increased by electrically repolarizing the cell. In addition to the\npotassium mechanism, there is a time dependent decrease in calcium conductivity which also\ncontributes to cellular repolarization.\n1.3 Propagation of the Action Potential\nAn action potential, once initiated in a cardiac cell, will propagate along the cell membrane\nuntil the entire cell is depolarized. Myocardial cells also have the unique property of transmitting\naction potentials from one cell to adjacent cells by means of direct current spread (without electro-\nchemical synapses). In fact, until about 1954 there was almost general agreement that the\nmyocardium was an actual syncytium without separate cell boundaries. But the electron microscope\nidentified definite cell membranes, showing that adjacent cells are separated by an extracellular\nspace of variable width. Cells join along structures known as intercalated disks (Fig. 7). The\nlocation of the low resistance connection between cells is a part of the intercalated disk known as\nthe gap junction or nexus. Ionic currents flow from cell to cell via these intercellular connections,\nand the heart behaves electrically as a functional syncytium. Thus, an impulse originating anywhere\nin the myocardium will propagate throughout the heart, resulting in a coordinated mechanical\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\ncontraction. (The atria, however, are electrically insulated from the ventricles except for the AV\nnode.) An artificial cardiac pacemaker, for example, introduces depolarizing electrical impulses via\nan electrode catheter usually placed within the right ventricle. Pacemaker-induced action potentials\nexcite the entire ventricular myocardium resulting in effective mechanical contractions.\nFigure 7 - The Intercalated Disk\nElectron microphotographs of the intercalated disc. Top: Transverse section of cat ventricular myocardium, showing\ninsertions of thin filaments into filamentous mats (arrows), which bind to the intercalated disc to form the fascia\nadherens (FA). This intracellular junction changes form at the right of the figure, where the two cells come into\ncontact at a nexus, of gap junction (N). Bottom: Oblique section of intercalated disc in mouse ventricular\nmyocardium, showing filaments (arrow) joining fascia adherens (FA) and a nexus (N). Two maculae adherens (MA),\nor desmosomes, are also shown. All of these structures represent specialized cell-cell junctions.

The one-dimensional cable model of the\ncell is helpful in understanding the process. The cardiac cell may be thought of as a cylindrical\nmembrane which separates the internal conducting medium from the extracellular conducting\nmedium. The membrane may be considered as a relative insulator with properties described in\nprevious sections. Fig. 8 is a schematic diagram of the model, which assumes that charge carriers\nare restricted to move in only one dimension inside and outside of the cell. The boxes, M, represent\nthe lumped properties of the membrane over a length of ∆x. The resistances per unit length of the\ninside and outside conductors are ri and ro respectively; im represents the transmembrane current\nper unit length.\nFigure 8 - The Cable Model of a Cylindrical Cell\nM\nM\nM\nro ∆∆∆∆x\nri ∆∆∆∆x\nVi\nVo\nim∆∆∆∆x\nii\nio\nVo+∆∆∆∆ Vo\nVi+∆∆∆∆ Vi\nim∆∆∆∆x\nii+∆∆∆∆ ii\n∆∆∆∆x\nio+∆∆∆∆ io\nThe currents flowing inside and outside of the cell are ii and io, and at any particular point\nthey must be equal and opposite, since there are no current sources or sinks, or other available\ncurrent paths. Vo and Vi represent the extracellular and intracellular potentials, respectively. The\ntransmembrane potential Vm is (Vi - Vo) at each position along the cell. All currents and voltages\nare, in general, functions of both position and time.\nBy applying Ohm's law, we have:\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\niiri∆x = -∆Vi\n(5)\nIn the limit as ∆x →0 this becomes:\n∂Vi\n∂x = -iiri\n(6)\nBy similar reasoning applied to the outer conductor, we obtain\n∂Vo\n∂x = ioro = iiro\n(7)\nBy analyzing current flows at any node, we observe that\n∆ii = -im∆x\n(8)\nor in the limit:\n∂ii\n∂x = -im\n(9)\nRecalling the definition of Vm, and using (6) and (7)\n∂Vm\n∂x = ∂\n∂x Vi -Vo\n(\n) = ∂Vi\n∂x -∂Vo\n∂x = -ii ri + r0\n(\n)\nii = -\nri + ro\n(\n)\n∂Vm\n∂x\n(10)\nDifferentiating and substituting into (9) we obtain\nim =\nri + ro\n(\n)\n∂2Vm\n∂x2\n(11)\nThe membrane current per unit length is given by:\nim = Cm\n∂Vm\n∂t\n+ Vm\nrm\n(12)\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nwhere Cm is the membrane capacitance per unit length and rm is the equivalent membrane resistance\nper unit length. Substituting equation (12) into equation (11) results in the differential equation:\n∂2Vm x,t\n(\n)\n∂x2\n= ro + ri\n(\n) Cm\n∂Vm\n∂t\n+ Vm\nrm\n\n(13)\n1.3.1.1 The Space Constant\nThis equation may be solved simply for the time invariant case ∂Vm\n∂t\n= 0\n\nto yield the\nvariation of membrane potential with length resulting from a fixed initial transmembrane potential\nV0 at one point (x=0) on an infinitely long strip of muscle cells.\nVm x\n( ) = V0e-x λ\n(14)\nwhere λ =\nrm\nri + ro\n.\nThe membrane current, im, will have the same functional form as Vm. λ is the so-called\n\"space constant,\" and is a measure of the distance from the origin at which the membrane potential\n(or current) falls to l/e of its initial value.1\n1rm, ri, ro have been defined in terms associated with a particular cell. In order to account for geometric\nfactors, it is useful to use units for conductivities which are geometry-independent. We will also simplify the\nexpressions by assuming that ro<< ri.\nDefine:\nri =\nr\nπa2 where ρ is the resistivity (Ω - cm) of the internal media.\nrm = Rm\n2πa where Rm is the transverse membrane resistivity in Ω - cm2.\ncm =2πaCm where Cm = capacitance per unit area\nIt follows that λ =\naRm\n2ρ .\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nThe transmembrane current depolarizes the membrane ahead of the action potential, and\nthereby propagates the impulse down the cell. The current also flows from one cell to the next via\nthe low-resistance nexi, and thus the action potential spreads directly from cell to cell. The velocity\nof propagation increases with increasing cell diameter, action potential amplitude, and the initial rate\nof the rise of the action potential. The resistance of the nexi also has a major impact on conduction\nvelocity: increased resistance slows conduction velocity.\n1.4 Automaticity\nA number of cardiac cells display the property of automaticity -- that is, they have the\nability to spontaneously generate propagated action potentials, and function as pacemaker cells.\nSuch cells are found in the SA node, the specialized conduction systems of the atria and ventricles,\nand in the AV nodal region. In automatic cells, the diastolic (phase 4) potential is not stable, but\nshows spontaneous depolarization (Fig. 9).\nFigure 9\nDiagram of the Transmembrane Potential of an Automatic Cell\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nNotice that the membrane potential starts at the resting potential, VR, and that it slowly\nincreases toward zero. When the potential reaches a threshold level, VT, the cell develops an action\npotential. Following the action potential, the membrane potential returns to the resting level and the\ncycle repeats.\nSpontaneous phase 4 depolarization occurs in cells with high levels of membrane potential\n(-60 to -90 mV), and also in cells with low membrane resting potentials (≥ -60mV). The former\ngroup includes cells in the Purkinje system and cells of the atrial conduction system. The second\ngroup includes cells in the SA node, the AV junction and Purkinje fibers which have been partially\ndepolarized experimentally or by local pathology. The mechanism underlying phase 4\ndepolarization is probably different in the two groups of cells. Phase 4 depolarization in the first\ngroup is thought to be due to a spontaneous decrease in potassium conductance, gK, during diastole\nin the presence of a steady inward sodium movement. The result is a movement of the membrane\npotential toward the sodium equilibrium potential. When threshold is reached, these cells develop an\naction potential with a rapid upstroke (Fig. 10).\nFigure 10\nAutomatic Activity in Purkinje fibers (in the presence of 0.1 mm barium chloride in\nTyrode's solution). Calibration: vertical, 25mV, horizontal 20 msec.\nFor automatic cells with low membrane resting potentials, the sodium channels are\ninactivated, and the mechanisms underlying phase 4 depolarization are not so clear. Spontaneous\nBarium\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nimpulse generation does occur, and is presumably the normal mechanism for SA nodal activity.\n(See Fig. 11.) The action potentials have the slow upstroke characteristic of the slow current\nmechanism. It appears that the slow inward current may underlie automaticity in these cells. For\nexample, it has been shown that slow-channel blocking agents such as verapamil will reduce the\nspontaneous rate of the SA node fibers. The effect can be overcome by sympathomimetic amines\n(such as isoproterenol) which are known to stimulate slow inward current.\nFigure 11\nSpontaneous Activity in a Single Sinoatrial Node Cell (From Rosen MR, Janse MJ, and Wit\nAL (eds.): Cardiac Electrophysiology: A Textbook. Mount Kisco NY, Futura Publishing Co., 1990,\np 119.)\nThere is a gradient of automaticity in the heart. The intrinsic rate of the SA node is highest\n(about 60 per minute), followed by the AV node (about 50 per minute), and the ventricular muscle\n(about 30-40 per minute). Normally the SA node determines heart rate, the lower pacemakers being\nreset during each cardiac cycle. However, in some pathologic circumstances, the rate of lower\npacemakers can exceed that of the SA node, and then the lower pacemakers determine overall heart\nrate.\nThe intrinsic rate of a pacemaking cell can be markedly altered by changing its ionic\nenvironment, and by autonomic nervous stimulation. Changes in rate may be mediated by changes\nin resting potential, threshold potential, or rate of phase 4 depolarization. For example, in Fig. 12\nbelow it is shown that vagal stimulation in the frog sinus venosus reduces the rate of diastolic\ndepolarization and hyperpolarizes the cell, thereby slowing the rate. Vagal stimulation also shortens\n-50\n100 ms\nmV\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Rosen MR, Janse MJ, and WitAL (eds.): Cardiac Electrophysiology:\nA Textbook.

The transmembrane potential\nmay be increased to threshold by spontaneous phase 4 depolarization, by electronic spread from\nadjacent cells, or by external stimulating electrodes. Mechanical deformation may also elicit action\npotentials.\no\n-100\n1s\n1s\nPotential (mV)\nPotential (mV)\nBefore adrenaline\n10 min after adrenaline\n-10\n-20\n-40\n-60\nA\nB\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Otsuka 1958.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nDuring a period immediately following an action potential, the cell cannot be re-excited to\nproduce a propagated action potential. This period includes phases 0,1,2, and the first part of phase\n3, and is termed the \"effective refractory period\". (See Fig. 15.)\nFigure 15 - Cellular Excitability\nRelationship between transmembrane action potential from single ventricular muscle fiber and excitability of fiber to\ncathodal stimulation. FRT, Full recovery time; ARP-ERP, effective refractory period; RRP, relative refractory\nperiod; SNP, supernormal period. (From Hoffman and Cranefield.)\nAs the cell begins to repolarize to about -50 mV, it enters the so-called \"relatively\nrefractive\" period when a propagated action potential can be initiated, but requires a stimulus much\nstronger than that needed for the resting cell. Furthermore, the resultant action potential is generally\nof low amplitude, with a slow rise-time and has a slow propagation velocity. (The fast sodium\nchannels are inactivated.) A \"supernormal period\" follows the relative refractory period. During\nthis time, the cell may be re-triggered with a stimulus slightly smaller than the normal phase 4\nthreshold stimulus. Thus, excitability is somewhat enhanced. However, the resulting action potential\nis still somewhat reduced from normal in amplitude, rise-time, and propagation velocity. (The\nsodium channels are still not fully activated.) In general, the later the second stimulus comes, the\nmore the sodium channels are reactivated, and the more rapid the upstroke of the second action\npotential (Fig. 16).\n+20\n-20\nFull recovery time\n-40\n-60\n-80\n-100\nmv\nmsec\nEffective refractory period\nRelative\nrefractory period\nsupernormal\nperiod\nFigure by MIT OCW.

(Redrawn from Rosen, M.S., Wit, A.L., and\nHoffman, B.F., Am. Heart J.) 88:380, 1974.)\n1.5.2 - Cells with Slow Response\nExcitability of the slow response is more complex. The effective refractory period usually\nextends well beyond the end of phase 3 into phase 4. The recovery of full excitability takes\nconsiderably more time (seconds) than for the fast response cells (tenths of seconds). Until full\nrecovery occurs, the conduction velocity varies with excitability. The long refractory periods in these\ncells account for the development of conduction blocks at the AV junction as heart rate increases.\nSome fibers showing slow response action potentials seem to demonstrate a cumulative loss of\nexcitability if they are driven too rapidly (manifested clinically as rate-dependent block).\n1.6 Interval-Duration Relationship\nThe duration of the action potential varies with the cycle length (the interval between\nsuccessive beats). Action potentials following a short interval are shorter in duration, and vice versa\n(See Fig. 17.) The refractory period is related to the duration of the action potential. Thus, a long\npause between two beats will prolong the refractory period of the second beat. This fact is well\nknown in clinical electrocardiography since it explains the tendency for premature impulses\nfollowing long pauses to find the conduction system in a partially refractive state, resulting in\naberrant conduction of these impulses to the ventricles (Ashman phenomenon).\n+\n-\n100 msec\nVm (mV)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Where the diastolic interval is short, the action potential duration is also short (B). When the heart\nrate is variable (C), the action potential duration is directly proportional to the duration of the preceding diastolic\ninterval. The lengths of the refractory periods in these beats are closely correlated to the durations of the action\npotentials.\n1.7 Excitation-Contraction Coupling\nAs a wave of electrical depolarization spreads over a myocardial fiber, mechanical\ncontraction is initiated. The relative time courses of the transmembrane potential and the\ndevelopment of isometric force are diagrammed in Fig. 18. Notice that the peak force is developed\nbefore the end of the effective refractory period. Cardiac muscle, therefore, cannot be tetanized as\ncan skeletal muscle.\nThe details of excitation-contraction coupling are quite complex, and are beyond the scope\nof these notes. In very general terms, the depolarization of the cell membrane is associated with an\ninflux of calcium ions into the cell both from the extracellular sources and from intracellular stores.\nThe calcium ion is released into the vicinity of the sarcomere where it inhibits an inhibitor\n(troponine-tropomyosin) of the actin-myosin reaction, thus triggering a mechanical contraction\n(Katz, 1992).\nHeart Rate\nA\nB\nC\nSlow\nRapid\nVariable\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFigure 18 - Electrical and Mechanical Activity in the Myocyte\nDiagram showing relationship between transmembrane action potential, A, and isometric tension nerve.

(Modified\nfrom Brooks et al.)\n1.8 The Cardiac Conduction System\nSome muscle cells in the heart are specialized to serve as the \"electrical control and\ndistribution system.\" They serve to generate periodic impulses which establish the heart rate\n(pacemaker function), and to rapidly conduct the action potentials to the rest of the heart. Taken as a\nwhole, these cells comprise the cardiac conduction system. The major functional elements include:\nthe sino-atrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, and the intraventricular conduction system.\nThe latter includes the common bundle (Bundle of HIS), the major right and left bundle branches,\nand the diffusely arborizing which anastomoses with ventricular myocardium. (Recall Fig. 6 which\ndiagrams the anatomy of the conduction system, together with representative transmembrane action\npotentials.)\n+20\n-20\n-40\nA\nB\n-60\n-80\n-100\n1 gm\nmv\nmsec\nEffective\nrefractory\nperiod\nRelative\nrefractory period\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Brooks et al.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nThe cardiac impulse normally arises in the SA node. This structure is a region of specialized\nmuscle cells located in the right atrium near the entrance of the superior vena cava. Sympathetic and\nparasympathetic fibers richly innervate this region, and may speed or slow the rate of impulse\nformation to vary heart rate. Action potentials spread from the SA node throughout the atria with a\npropagation velocity of about 1 meter/second. Electrophysiologic studies have suggested the\nexistence of at least three routes of preferential conduction in the atria with propagation velocities\nsomewhat greater than in non-specialized atrial tissue. Although some workers doubt the existence\nof specific anatomically differentiated bundles, they are often referred to as the internodal tracts, and\nserve to channel the impulse from the SA node to the atrio-ventricular (AV node). Cells in the\ninternodal tracts may also function as pacemakers under the right conditions.\nThe AV node, or more properly, the AV \"junction\" is normally the only conducting bridge\nbetween atria and ventricles. The electrophysiology of the AV junction is particularly complex. The\narea has been divided into three regions: the AN region at the atrial end, the N region in the center\nof the node, and the NH region where the node merges into the common bundle of His (Fig. 19).\nThe velocity of the action potential slows drastically during its passage through the AV junction--\nparticularly in the N region--to 0.02 - 0.05 meters/second. An effective delay of about 70-80\nmilliseconds is introduced in this manner, thus permitting atrial contraction to be completed before\nventricular contraction begins. The AV junction is also richly innervated with autonomic fibers\nwhich modulate the conduction velocity. (Increased vagal tone decreases velocity, while increased\nsympathetic tone increases velocity. ) Cells in the AV junction - particularly those in the AN and\nNH regions - possess the property of autorhythmicity, and many function as the cardiac pacemaker\nsite if impulses fail to reach the area from higher levels in the conduction system.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFigure 19 - Atrioventricular conduction system.\nThe AV node can be divided functionally into three regions: AN (upper, or atrionodal), N (middle, or nodal), and NH\n(lower, or nodal-His bundle). (From Katz, Arnold M., Physiology of the Heart (New York: Raven Press Books,\n1992), p. 467.)\nAfter emerging from the AV node, the impulse enters the common bundle of His and\npropagates rapidly at a velocity of 1-2 meters/sec. Activation spreads into the right bundle branch\nand the two fascicles (anterior and posterior divisions) of the left bundle branch (Fig. 20).\nDepolarization spreads rapidly (2-4 m/sec.) through the Purkinje system to the muscle cells of the\ninner wall of the heart. The ventricular muscle cells then continue to conduct the action potential\n(somewhat more slowly at 0.5-1 m/sec.) from cell to cell, until the entire ventricular muscle mass is\ndepolarized.\nVentricular depolarization begins on the left side of the interventricular septum, spreads to\nthe apex, then to the walls of the ventricles, and finally to the base of the left ventricle. It takes about\n80 milliseconds to completely depolarize the ventricles. Fig. 21 illustrates the normal sequence of\nventricular depolarization.\nAV node\nAV bundle\nN\nNH\nAN\nFigure by MIT OCW.

THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY\n2.1 lntroduction\nIn the preceding section, we reviewed the electrophysiology of myocardial cells. As a result\nof the electrical activity of those cells, current flows within the body and potential differences are\nestablished on the surface of the skin which can be measured using suitable equipment. The\ngraphical recording of these body surface potentials as a function of time produces the\nelectrocardiogram (ECG). Fig. 22 illustrates a single-lead scalar electrocardiogram.\nFigure 22 - Example of a Scalar Electrocardiogram\n(From Philips and Feeney, The Cardiac Rhythms: A Systematic Approach to Interpretation, Philadelphia:\nW.B.Saunders, 1980, p. 36.)\nIn this section we wish to examine the relationship between the cellular events and the body\nsurface potentials. The clinician who uses the electrocardiogram as a diagnostic test wishes to\ndetermine cardiac abnormalities from the body surface potentials. Given a distribution of body\nsurface potentials, can we specify the detailed electrophysiologic behavior of the source?\nUnfortunately this \"inverse\" problem does not have a unique solution as demonstrated in 1853 by\nHermann von Helmholz. It is not, in general, possible to uniquely specify the characteristics of a\ncurrent generator from the external potential measurements alone.\nThe \"forward\" problem is more tractable: given knowledge of the heart generator, can the\nbody surface potentials be specified? If the transmembrane potentials of all the cells within the heart\nwere known, can a mathematical expression be found to specify the extracellular potentials\neverywhere in the surrounding space? A complete solution would include details of tissue geometry\n\nFigure courtesy of PhysioNet (http://www.physionet.org).\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nand electrical properties, as well as an exhaustive description of the detailed electrical activity of the\nheart. The investigation of the forward problem has frequently employed the use of physical and/or\nmathematical models. A number of investigators have studied models of the human torso in which\nthey have imbedded well-defined electrical sources. The models are typically plastic containers\nshaped in the form of a human torso and filled with a conductive liquid medium. Inhomogeneities\nof the conducting media (such as lungs) are sometimes modeled by bags of lower conductivity\nmaterial such as sand. By placing well-defined electrical dipole sources within the model torso, the\nrelationship between the cardiac generator and body surface potentials may be studied.\nMathematical models have been proposed as well. The heart is typically represented by a number of\nspatially distributed dipole sources imbedded in a conductive medium of variable complexity.\nComputer simulations have made it possible to develop impressive demonstrations using hundreds\nof dipoles, and synthesizing the resultant body surface potential distributions (Miller, Geselowitz,\n1978). The simplest mathematical model for relating the cardiac generator to the body surface\npotentials is the single dipole model. This simple model is an interesting and useful one which dates\nback to the earliest days of human electrocardiography. It is still extremely useful in providing a\nframework for the study of clinical electrocardiography and vectorcardiography.\n2.2 The Dipole Model\nThe model has two components: a) a representation of the electrical activity of the heart\ncells, and b) a representation of the geometry and electrical properties of the body. Having modeled\nthe source and the conductive body media, it is a straightforward task to develop the relationship\nbetween source and surface potentials.\n2.2.1 The Source\nThe smallest unit contributing to the ECG is the single myocardial cell. Fig. 23 shows such\na cell in which an action potential is propagating. The action potential is associated with a current,\ni(x,t), within the cell flowing in the direction of propagation of the action potential. The cable model\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nrelated this current to the spatial gradient of the membrane potential in equation (10) which is\nrewritten here:\ni x,t\n(\n) = -\nri + ro\n(\n)\n⋅∂Vm x,t\n(\n)\n∂x\n(10)\nIf the action potential propagates with constant shape and at constant velocity, c, then it can\nbe shown that Vm x,t\n(\n) = Vm x -ct\n(\n). It follows that:\n∂Vm x,t\n(\n)\n∂x\n= -1\nc\n∂Vm x,t\n(\n)\n∂t\n(15)\nFigure 23 - Current flow in a Myocardial Cell at the Advancing Front of Depolarization\nThus, equation (10) may be written\ni =\nri + ro\n(\n)\n⋅1\nc ⋅∂Vm x,t\n(\n)\n∂t\n(16)\nwhere the variables are defined as in section 1.3.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nWe will consider the intracellular longitudinal current at the interface of normal and\ndepolarized tissue to be the elementary electrical source, which we will refer to as a current dipole.\nA current dipole is an unusual concept, and is worth discussing more carefully. It is defined\nas a uniform current density, jo, flowing in a small cylindrical region of length dl, and cross-\nsectional area dA. (See Fig. 24.) The current flows parallel to dA\n→ where dA\n→ is a vector normal to\nthe elemental area dA.\nFigure 24 - A Current Dipole\nAs dA and dl approach zero, the product jo ⋅dA\n→⋅dl\n\nremains constant. We will define rmo as the\ncurrent dipole moment:\nrmo = jo ⋅dA\n→⋅dl\n(17)\nNote that rmo is a vector quantity and has units of current × length.\nThe direction of rmo points in the direction of propagation of the action potential. If the cell\nrests in a uniform conducting medium, the current lines will close to form a dipole current field. The\nassumption that dA and dl approach zero is reasonable in the context of the typical dimensions\ninvolved. Myocardial cell diameters are about 10 microns (10-3 cm) and typical dimensions of the\nheart and chest are in the order of tens of centimeters.\nIt is useful to assign typical numerical values to the intracellular longitudinal current and the\ncorresponding dipole moment given equations (14) and (15) respectively. The action potential\namplitude is typically 100 mV, and the rise-time is about 1 millisecond. Thus,\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\n∂Vm\n∂t =100 volts/ second\nThe velocity of propagation is roughly 100 cm/sec. in ventricular muscle. For simplicity we\nwill assume that r0 << ri. The resistance per unit length of the intracellular media, ri, can be\nestimated by assuming a resistivity, ρ, of 100 ohm-cm, and a cellular cross-sectional area of\napproximately 10-6 cm2. It follows that\nri = ρ/da =108 ohms/cm\nThe intracellular current then becomes\ni =10-8 amperes\nIn order to calculate the magnitude of the dipole moment, mo, we require an estimate of dl,\nthe effective length of the source. Using the previous values of action potential velocity and\nupstroke time, the estimate for dl is 10-l cm. Thus, the estimated magnitude of the dipole moment\nwould be:\n|mo| ≈ 10-9 amp-cm\nThe heart's total electrical activity at any instant of time may be represented by a distribution\nof active current dipoles. In general, they will lie on an irregular surface corresponding to the\nboundary between depolarized and polarized tissue.\nIf the heart were suspended in a homogeneous isotropic conducting medium, and were\nobserved from a distance large compared to its size, then all of the individual current dipoles may be\nassumed to originate at the same point in space. The total electrical activity of the heat may then be\nrepresented as a single equivalent dipole whose magnitude and direction is the vector summation of\nall the individual dipole sources. The net equivalent dipole moment,\nr\nM, is commonly referred to as\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nthe \"heart vector\". As cardiac depolarization spreads, the heart vector,\nr\nM changes in magnitude\nand direction as a function of time. (Refer to Fig. 21 above.)\n2.2.2 Electrical Properties of Tissue\nThe sources that characterize the electrical activity of the heart are immersed in the body, and\nthe resulting distribution of currents and potentials depends on the electrical properties of the torso.\nThese have been investigated and the following results have been determined.\nLinearity: For the current densities produced by the heart, the body tissues may be\nconsidered linear: that is, the potential gradient or electric field is everywhere proportional to the\ncurrent density.\nr\nJ = σ\nr\nE = -σ\nr\n∇Φ\n(18)\nwhere\nr\nJ ≡ current density, σ ≡ conductivity of the tissue,\nr\nE ≡ electrical field, and Φ ≡\npotential.\nHomogeneity: Different tissues have conductivities which vary considerably from one\nanother. For example, blood has a conductivity approximately five times as great as other tissues,\nand blood masses such as those within the ventricles and great vessels certainly introduce time-\nvarying inhomogeneities into the thorax. Likewise, lung tissue, although its average conductivity is\nsimilar to other tissue, varies by a factor of five or so with respiration! Thus, the torso is far from a\nhomogeneous medium. Furthermore, its properties vary with time!\nAnisotropy: An isotropic medium is one in which the properties are independent of\norientation or direction. Some tissues are reasonably isotropic in small regions, but not all. In\nmuscle, for example, the impedance along fibers is less than that measured across fibers. In\naddition, the presence of structures such as high-conductivity cylindrical blood vessels, and low-\nconductivity bronchi and bone make the thorax a highly anisotropic medium.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nComplex Impedance: In the frequency band of interest (0.1 - 103 Hz), the reactive\ncomponents of tissue impedance are sufficiently small that the chest may be considered purely\nresistive.\nFor simplicity, the dipole model ignores the known anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the\ntorso, and represents it as a linear, isotropic, homogeneous, spherical conductor of radius, R, and\nconductivity, σ. The source is represented as a slowly time-varying current dipole,\nr\nM, located at the\ncenter of the sphere (Fig. 25). The problem is considered as a quasi-static one. The static electric\nfield, current density, and electric potential everywhere within the torso (and on its surface) will be\nrelated to the heart vector,\nr\nM.\nFigure 25 - The Idealized Spherical Torso with the Centrally Located Cardiac Source\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\n2.2.3 Calculation of Potential within the Sphere\nWithin the sphere, equation (18) must hold. In addition, since there is no net generation of\ncharge anywhere,\nr\n∇⋅\nr\nJ = 0\n(19)\nBy combining equations (18) and (19), Laplace's equation for the potential is obtained:\n∇2 ⋅Φ = 0\n(20)\nBy linearly combining general solutions to Laplace's equation for a sphere in order to\nsatisfy the boundary conditions, the potential field may be found. The boundary conditions are:\n1. The potential gradient in the radial direction must be zero at the surface of the sphere,\nsince no current is permitted to flow across the skin into air. Thus,\n∂Φ r,θ\n(\n)\n∂r\n= 0 at r = R\n(21)\n2. We have assumed the source to be modeled by an equivalent current dipole of magnitude,\nMo, located at the center of the sphere. Hence, from the definition of equation (17), we must have:\nMo =\nr\nJ ⋅\n∫∫∫\ndA\n→dl\n(22)\nOne solution to Laplace's equation is:\nΦ1 r,θ\n(\n) = Kcosθ\nr2\n(23)\nThe current densities may be obtained from the potential by using equation (18). Then,\nusing appropriate mathematical manipulations, the integration of equation (22) may be done in the\nregion of the source to evaluate K. The result yields:\nΦ1 r,θ\n(\n) =\nMo\n4πσr2 cosθ\n(24)\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nThis solution, however, cannot satisfy the first boundary condition at the surface of the\nsphere (eq. 21). We must add another solution to Laplace's equation of the form:\nΦ2 r,2\n(\n) = Arcosθ\n(25)\nNote that this potential disappears at r = 0, and thus will not alter our solution for K. The\nnew solution becomes:\nΦ r,θ\n(\n) = Φ1 r,θ\n(\n) + Φ2 r,θ\n(\n)\nThe boundary condition of eq. (21) is satisfied when\nA = 2Mo\n4πσR3\n(26)\nHence, the final solution for the potential within the sphere is:\nΦ r,θ\n(\n) = Mo\n4πσ cosθ 1\nr2 + 2r\nR3\n\n(27)\n2.2.4 The Surface Potentials\nAt the surface of the sphere (corresponding to the skin surface on the spherical torso), r=R\nand\nΦ R,θ\n(\n) =\n3Mo\n4πσR2 cosθ\n(28)\nwhere Mo is the magnitude of the equivalent heart vector, R is the radius of the sphere, and θ is the\nangle between the point of observation an the direction of the heart vector.\nNote that (28) could also be written in vector form\nΦA =\nr\nM - OA\n→\n\n(29)\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nwhere OA\n→\nis a vector from the origin to point A on the surface of the sphere, making an angle θ\nwith the axis oi the dipole (Fig. 26). The units of\nr\nM are current × length and the units of OA\n→\nare\nohms/length.\nThe amplitude of OA is given by:\nOA = 3\n4π ⋅1\nσ ⋅1\nR2\nNote that this amplitude is determined by the electrical conductance of the medium, σ, and\nthe physical distance, R. As the radius gets larger |OA| becomes smaller, etc. The locus of the tips\nof OA\n→\nfor all θ forms a surface called an \"image surface\". Each point on the torso surface maps\ninto a corresponding point on the image surface. OA\n→\nis a transfer impedance vector\n(impedance/length) or a \"lead vector\". Eq. (29) thus is a statement of Ohm's Law.\nReferring to Fig. 26, note that the potential at a different point on the surface, B, would be\ngiven by:\nΦB =\nr\nM - OB\n→\n\nFigure 26 - Lead Vectors and the Heart Vector\nThus, the potential difference between points A and B would be:\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nVAB = ΦA -ΦB =\nr\nM - OA\n→\n-\nr\nM - OB\n→\n\n=\nr\nM - OA\n→\n-OB\n→\n\n=\nr\nM -\nr\nLAB\nThe potential difference VAB is simply the scalar product of the heart vector with vector,\nr\nLAB,which is commonly referred to as the \"lead vector\". The lead vector connects the points A and\nB on the image surface.\nSince in general\nr\nM is a function of time, the scalar potential difference VABwill also vary\nwith time. At any instant VAB will be the dot product, or projection of the instantaneous heart vector\non lead vector\nr\nLAB.\nA wide variety of lead vectors may be formed by attaching electrodes to the body in various\npositions. This subject will be covered in the next section.\nAn order-of-magnitude calculation may be made using equation (28) to estimate the value of\nthe body surface potential to be expected from the electrical activity of the heart. We will consider a\nparticular instant during cardiac depolarization when the interface between polarized and\ndepolarized tissue is 1 cm2, and is approximately planar (Fig. 27).\nFigure 27 - Schematic diagram showing a l-cm2 area of interface between polarized and\ndepolarized tissue early in the cardiac cycle.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nSince the cross-sectional area of individual cellular dipoles is 10-6 cm2, there will be approximately\n106 of them in the interface region, and they will be parallel. Thus, the magnitude of net equivalent\nheart dipole will be:\n|Mo| = n|Mo| =106 × 10-9 =10-3 amp. cm.\nWe will assume a torso with a radius of 20 cm. and a conductivity, σ, of\n3 × 103 ohm-1-cm-1. The maximum surface potential would be\nΦmax =\n3M\n4πσR2 = 0.2 mV\nThus, the model predicts surface potentials in the order of fractions of millivolts, which\ncorresponds closely to experimentally measured values early in the sequence of ventricular\ndepolarization.\n2.3 Lead Systems Used in Scalar Electrocardiography\nNot surprisingly, the lead systems used in clinical practice utilize the limbs, since they are\nconvenient point of attachment for electrodes. In addition, chest electrodes are used to record\nprojections of the heart vector onto the horizontal plane.\n2.3.1 Frontal Plane Scalar Leads\nSuppose an electrode were attached to each arm and one leg of the subject (Fig. 28).\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFigure 28 -- The Ideal Torso and Dipole Model\nThe potentials at the points indicated will be:\nΦRA =\nr\nM - ORA\n→\n\nΦLA =\nr\nM - OLA\n→\n\nΦLL =\nr\nM - OLL\n→\n\n(33)\nThe potential differences between the limb leads may also be determined. In\nelectrocardiography the standard limb lead voltages are defined as:\nVI = ΦLA -ΦRA\nVII = ΦLL -ΦRA\nVIII = ΦLL -ΦLA\n(34)\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFrom our previous considerations, and noting the definition of lead vectors\nr\nLI,\nr\nLII, and\nr\nLIII\nfrom Fig. 28, we have:\nVI =\nr\nM - OLA\n→\n\n-ORA\n→\n\n=\nr\nM -\nr\nLI\nVII =\nr\nM -\nr\nLII\nVIII =\nr\nM -\nr\nLIII\nA simple way to visualize these results is to note that VI is simply the projection of the heart\nvector\nr\nM on the lead vector\nr\nLI.\nIt has been found useful in electrocardiography to define a \"central terminal\" by averaging\nthe potentials from the limb leads.\nΦCT = ΦRA + ΦLA + ΦLL\n=\nr\nM - ORA\n→\n\n+ OLA\n→\n\n+ OLL\n→\n\n= 0\nsince the vectors in the parenthesis sum to zero. Using the central terminal as a reference, one may\nnow construct new lead vectors\nVL = ΦLA -ΦCT = ΦLA =\nr\nM - OLA\n→\n\nVR = ΦRA =\nr\nM - ORA\n→\n\nVF = ΦLL =\nr\nM - OLL\n→\n\n(37)\nThese leads may be improved by using the circuits shown in Fig. 29.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFigure 29 -- Standard Connections for Augmented Limb Leads\naVL = ΦLA -ΦRA + ΦLL\n\n= 1.5VL\naVR = ΦRA -ΦLA + ΦLL\n\n= 1.5VR\naVF = ΦLL -ΦLA + ΦRA\n\n= 1.5VF\n(38)\nThese leads are referred to as the augmented limb leads.\nThe complete set of frontal lead vectors is shown in Fig. 30 with all vectors drawn to pass\nthrough the origin. It should be noted that the amplitudes of these lead vectors are not equal.\nr\nLI,\nr\nLII,\nr\nLIII = R 3 while the augmented leads are 1.5R. (This difference will be ignored.)\n2.3.2 Precordial Leads\nBy using the \"central terminal\" as a reference electrode, and placing an exploring electrode\nat various points on the chest, a variety of horizontal plane lead vectors may be obtained. In clinical\npractice, six standard chest leads are used, and are termed V1, V2, ..., V6. The placement of the\nelectrodes is shown in Fig. 31.\nA complete scalar ECG, then, would consist of 12 leads - six frontal plane and six\nprecordial leads.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFigure 30 -- Frontal Plane Limb Leads\nFigure 31 -- The Six Standard Chest Leads\nThe location of these leads is as follows:\nV1: on the fourth intercostal space at the right sternal margin\nV2: on the fourth intercostal space at the left sternal margin\nV3: midway between leads V2 and V4\nV4: on the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line\nV5: on the anterior axillary line at the horizontal level of lead V4\nV6: on the midaxillary line at the horizontal level of lead V4\n-1200\n-1500\naVR\naVF\naVL\nI\nII\nIII\n-900\n-800\n-300\n+300\n+600\n+900\n+1200\n+1500\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\n2.4 Electrical Axis\nThe complete description of the source is a three-dimensional plot of the locus of the tip of\nthe equivalent heart vector. The same information could be presented in three two-dimensional plots\nshowing the projection of the locus on the horizontal, frontal, and sagittal planes. This type of\ndisplay is termed the vectorcardiogram. A typical frontal-plane loop is illustrated in Fig. 32.\nFigure 32 -- A Frontal Plane VCG Loop\nA waveform that would be recorded on lead I of the scalar ECG is simply the plot of the\nprojection of the loop onto\nr\nLI as a function of time. Similarly, the waveform that would be seen in\nLead II the projection of the loop onto\nr\nLII. These plots are shown in approximate form in Fig. 33.\nI\naVR\naVL\naVF\nIII\nII\nMean T\nVector\nLong Axis\nof QRS Loop\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nFigure 33 - Scalar Projections of the VCG on Limb Leads I, II, and III\nThe vector loop shown in Fig. 32 could be thought of as the locus of the tips of many\nindividual vectors, each of which is an instantaneous equivalent cardiac vector occurring at a\ndifferent time. The angle that each such vector makes with the horizontal would then correspond to\nthe instantaneous electrical axis of the heart in the frontal plane. The instantaneous axis of greatest\nmagnitude is the major instantaneous axis of the heart. Of more importance clinically is the mean\nelectrical cardiac vector. This represents the mean magnitude and direction of all the instantaneous\nvectors. The mean electrical axis of the heart is that angle, α, that the mean vector makes with the\nhorizontal (see Fig. 34). Note that angles are measured clockwise clinically, starting from the\nhorizontal. Normal axes fall between -10 and +110 .\nFigure 34 -- The Mean Electrical Cardiac Vector\nI\nII\nIII\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nMathematically, we may represent the instantaneous equivalent cardiac vector as projected in\nthe frontal plane as\nr\nM t( ). The mean vector is then:\nr\nMmean =\nr\nM 0( ) +\nr\nM ∆t\n(\n) +...+\nr\nM n∆t\n(\n)\nn +1\n(39)\nThis vector addition may be broken up into scalar components using any two lead vectors,\nwhich we will represent by\nr\nLA and\nr\nLB.\nr\nMmean = VA\nr\nLA + VB\nr\nLB\n(40)\nwhere VA is the magnitude of the projection of\nr\nMmean onto the lead vector\nr\nLA, and likewise\nfor VB. Thus,\nVA =\nr\nMmean -\nr\nLA\nVB =\nr\nMmean -\nr\nLB\nIt follows that\nMmean = VA 0( ) + VA ∆t\n(\n) + VA 2∆t\n(\n) +...+ VA n∆t\n(\n)\nn +1\n\nr\nLA +\nVB 0( ) + VB ∆t\n(\n) + VB 2∆t\n(\n) +...+ VB n∆t\n(\n)\nn +1\n\nr\nLB\nBy letting ∆t →0 and n →inf while keeping n∆t = T, multiplying numerators and\ndenominators by ∆t, and substituting integrals for sums, the following is obtained:\nr\nMmean =\nT\nVA t( )dt\nT∫\n\nr\nLA + 1\nT\nVB t( )dt\nT∫\n\nr\nLB\n(43)\nThus\nVA = 1\nT\nVA t( )dt\nT∫\n(44)\n\nPrinciples of Cardiac Electrophysiology\nVB = 1\nT\nVB t( )dt\nT∫\n(45)\nVA t( ) and VB t( ) are simply the scalar projections of\nr\nM on\nr\nLA and\nr\nLB. They are scalar functions\nof time (the ECG). The time, T, is the duration of the QRS complex.\nIf\nr\nMmean -\nr\nLA = 1\nT\nVA t( )dt\nT∫\n= 0\nthen\nr\nMmean must be perpendicular to\nr\nLA. This observation allows the clinician to make a rapid\nestimate of the mean electrical axis of the heart from a quick inspection of the six frontal scalar\nleads. One simply locates that lead where the mean area under the QRS complex is zero, or nearly\nso, and concludes that the mean axis of the heart is perpendicular to that lead. The sense of the\nvector is easily determined by observing the polarity of the net area under the curve of lead I. For\nexample, if this area were positive, the mean axis would have to lie in quadrants I or IV. Thus, in\nFigs. 32 and 33 above, we see that since\nT\nVIII t( )dt\nT∫\n≈0,\nthe mean electrical axis must be perpendicular to lead III: either +30 or -150 . Since VL > 0, the\nmean axis must be +30 .\nOne may approximate areas under the QRS complex by measuring amplitudes only, and\nassuming equal widths for positive and negative spikes. The net area is then proportional to the sum\nof all positive peaks in the QRS minus the sum of all negative spikes. In this way, the ratio of any\ntwo arbitrary means may be calculated, and the mean axis constructed graphically."

We will, however, limit\nourselves to lumped parameter models, and will not discuss distributed-parameter transmission line\ntype models. Hence, we will be able to discuss both average and pulsatile flows, volumes and\npressures, at selected points in the vascular bed, but we cannot discuss pulse wave propagation,\nreflections, detailed fluid flow behavior, etc.\nThere are three major functional components in the systemic vascular bed: the elastic\narteries, the microcirculation (including arterioles, capillaries, and venules), and the venous system.\nSee Figure 1. The pulmonary vascular bed has similar components, but the properties of the\npulmonary vascular resistance are unique.\nFigure 1\nS Y S T E M I C C I R C U L A T I O N\nArteries\nArterioles,\nCapillaries,\nVenules\nVeins\nWe will assume that the major resistive component in the systemic circulation is located at\nthe level of the microcirculation (primarily the arterioles), and that the large arteries and veins\ncontribute primarily capacitance. We will include, however, a small resistance in the venous return\npath. The venous capacitance is much larger than that of the arteries and provides the major\nreservoir for blood volume.\nB.\nVascular Resistance\nLaminar viscous flow in rigid tubes (Poiseuille flow) results in a parabolic distribution of\nvelocities across the tube, and a linear relationship exists between the pressure drop, P, and the flow\nrate, Q, through the tube.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n∆P = RQ\n(1)\nThe constant of proportionality is the resistance to flow, R. It is dependent upon the\ngeometry of the tube and the viscosity, μ, of the fluid.\nR = 8\nπ μ l\nr4\n(2)\nwhere l is the length of the tube over which ∆P is measured, and r is the radius of the tube. If the\nflow is measured in cc/sec, and ∆P in dynes/cm2, then the units of resistance are dyne-sec/cm5. If\npressure is measured in mmHg and flow in cc/sec., resistance is expressed in \"peripheral resistance\nunits,\" or PRU. Note that if the mean pressure drop across the circulation were 80 mmHg and the\ncardiac output were 5 liters/min. (which is about 80 cc/sec.) then total peripheral resistance would\nbe close to 1 PRU.\nThe resistance of the tube is directly proportional to length and viscosity and inversely\nproportional to the fourth power of the radius. Thus, one would expect that the major contribution\nto vascular resistance would be made by the smallest vessels.\nOne may use the measured flow distribution in the various vascular beds and the Poiseuille\nformula to estimate the relative resistance offered by various vessels. Such estimates are contained\nin Table 1, confirming that arterioles are the site of most of the peripheral resistance.\n(From Burton 1972, p. 91)\nTable 1\nRelative Resistance to Flow in the Vascular Bed\n\nAorta\n\n4%\nVenules\n4%\nLarge arteries\n\n5%\nTerminal Veins\n0.3%\nMean arterial branches\n\n10%\nMain venous branches\n0.7%\nTerminal branches\n\n6%\nLarge veins\n0.5%\nArterioles\n\n41%\nVena cava\n1.3%\nCapillaries\n\n27%\n\nTotal: arterial + capillary = 93%\n\nTotal venous = 7%\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nNote also that the strong dependance of the resistance upon vessel radius implies that\nsensitive regulation of flow is possible by changes in vessel diameter due to smooth muscle action.\nAlthough Poiseuille's law has many engineering applications, and although it gives\nconsiderable insight into flow in the circulation; nevertheless, it cannot be rigorously applied to the\ncirculation. It requires the following assumptions:\ni)\nThe fluid is homogeneous and Newtonian.\nBlood may be considered as a Newtonian fluid only if the radius of the vessel\nexceeds 0.5 mm, and if the shear rate exceeds 100 sec.-1. This condition, therefore\nexcludes arterioles, venules, and capillaries, since they are generally considerably\nless than 1 mm in diameter.\nii)\nThe flow is steady and inertia-free.\nIf the flow is pulsatile, the variable pressure gradient communicates kinetic energy to\nthe fluid, and the flow is no longer inertia-free. This condition excludes the larger\narteries.\niii)\nThe tube is rigid so that its diameter does not change with pressure.\nThis condition is never met in the circulatory system. The veins in particular depart\nfrom this assumption.\nAlthough Poiseuille's law does not apply strictly, we will consider that pressure and flow\nare linearly related in those parts of the circulation in which the viscous forces predominate over\ninertial forces (low Reynolds numbers). Hence, we will represent the small vessels (arterioles,\ncapillaries, and venules) as linear resistance elements governed by Eq. 1. (The calculation of R\nmay require modification in some vascular beds, however.)\nC.\nVascular Capacitance\n1.\nIntroduction\nThe walls of blood vessels are not rigid, but rather they stretch in response to increased\ntransmural pressure. The vessel walls contain four major elements: endothelial lining, elastin\nfibers, collagen fibers, and smooth muscle. The endothelium provides a smooth wall, and offers\nselective permeability to certain substances. The endothelial cells play very little part in the total\nelasticity of the walls. However, endothelial cells are active sensors of fluid shear stresses, and play\nan important role in regulation of smooth muscle tone via release of vasoactive molecules. The\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nelastin fibers are easily stretched (about six times more easily than rubber). They produce an elastic\ntension automatically as the vessel expands, and without biochemical energy expenditure. The\ncollagen fibers are much stiffer than the elastin fibers. However, these fibers are slack, and do not\nexert their tension until the vessel has been stretched. Thus, the more the vessel expands, the stiffer\nit becomes. The smooth muscle serves to produce an active tension, contracting under\nphysiological control, and changing the diameter of the lumen of the vessel. Figure 2 shows the\nrelative mixtures of the four elements in walls of various vessels. Notice the predominance of\nelastin in the large and medium arteries, and the predominance of smooth muscle in the small\narterioles. The former are elastic \"storage\" vessels, while the latter are controllable \"resistance\"\nvessels. The thin-walled collapsible veins perform the major storage, or capacitance role in the\ncirculation. The capillaries are formed of only a one cell thick endothelium, and are well suited for\ntheir role as an exchange mechanism between the circulating blood and the interstitial fluid.\nFigure 2\nVariety of size, thickness of wall and admixture of the four basic tissues in the wall of different blood vessels.

Volume-pressure curves for arteries and veins are\nshown in Figure 3. (Note the different scales.) The slope of the curve at any particular point is a\nmeasure of the incremental capacitance of the vessel. Notice that the V-P curves are not linear and\nthat the vessels get stiffer as they expand--hence the incremental capacitance decreases. Note also\nthat veins have a much larger capacitance than arteries, and are the major storage elements in the\ncirculation.\nC = ∆V\n∆P\n(3)\nFigure 3\nComparison of the distensibility of the aorta and of the vena cava. The way in which the cross-section of the vessels\nchanges in the two cases is also indicated. (From Burton 1972, p. 55.)\nThe model shown in Figure 4 provides an explanation for the non-linear behavior. In the\nfigure, the thin coils represent \"weak\" elastin fibers at different lengths. The heavy coil represents\na \"stiff\" collagen fibers which are initially not under tension. As the material is stretched, more\nparallel springs are added, which increase overall stiffness as distension is increased. It is also true\nthat the capacitance of arteries decreases with age. This increase in stiffness may be due to an\nRelative volume\nPressure in cms of water\nAorta\nVena cava\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nAfter p. 55 in Burton.

(See figure 5.) The\nmaterial is in equilibrium with a force F0 applied to it. The equilibrium tensile stress then is\nσ = F0 A. If the stress is increased to σ + d ′\nσ , the length will increase to l0 + dl. Hooke's Law\nrelates the fractional change in length dl/l0 (the strain) to the change in stress, dσ.\ndσ = E dl\nl0\n(4)\nFigure 5\nThe constant, E, is known as Young's modulus. The larger E, the \"stiffer\" the material.\nFor blood vessels, E is not constant, but is a function of pressure. The following table shows the\nvariation of E with transmural pressure for the thoracic aorta.\n\nTable 2\nVariation of Young's Modulus with Intraaortic Pressure\n\nP, mmHg\nE, dynes/cm2 x 106\n\n1.2\n\n4.2\n\nNote: 1 mmHg = 1330 dynes/cm2\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nb.\nLaPlace's Law\nIt is often of importance to relate the tension in the walls of hollow vessels to the transmural\npressure across the walls. Consider a cylinder of length, l, and wall thickness h (Figure 6a). The\ninner radius is r1 and the outer radius is r2. The internal pressure is p1, and the external pressure is\np2. The wall stress (force per unit area) is σ. We wish to derive the relation between σ and the\ntransmural pressure. Imagine that the cylinder is split down the axis (Figure 6b). The total force\npulling the cylinder half down will be:\nF1 = 2σhl\nFigure 6\nOpposing this force will be that due to the pressures acting on the projected\narea of the cylindrical walls. The net force due to the pressure differences is:\nF2 = 2P1r1l -2P2r2l\nIn order to have equilibrium,\nF1 = F2\n2σhl = 2l P1r1 -P2r2\n(\n)\nσh = P1r1 -P2r2\n(\n)\n(5)\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nIf the vessel is thin-walled (h << r), then r1 ≈r2 = r0 and\nσh = r0P\n(6)\nwhere P is the transmural pressure. Equation (6) is an expression of LaPlace's law for a thin-\nwalled cylinder. Note that for a given transmural pressure, the wall tension (T = σh) per unit length\nincreases as the radius increases and vice versa.\nCan you derive Laplace's law for a thin-walled sphere? σh = r0P\n\nc.\nCalculation of Arterial Capacitance\nThe arterial capacitance per unit length, Cu, may be calculated assuming that vessel length\ndoes not vary with transmural pressure.\nCu = dA p,x\n(\n)\ndP x\n( )\n(7)\nwhere A(p,x) and P(x) are the vessel cross-sectional area and transmural pressure respectively Both\nmay be functions of x, the length along the vessel axis, and the area will also vary with pressure, P.\nFrom LaPlace's Law (Eq. 6) we may relate the change in wall stress to the change in\ntransmural pressure at a particular radius, r0.\ndσ = r0\nh dP + P\nh dr\n(8)\nFrom Hooke's law we have\ndσ = E dc\nc0\n(9)\nwhere c is the circumference of the cylinder, 2πr.\ndσ = E 2πdr\n2πr0\n= E dr\nr0\n(10)\nCombining (8) and (10) we obtain the relation between changes in radius and changes in pressure\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\ndr\ndP =\nr0\nh\nE\nr0\n-P\nh\n\n(11)\nFrom (7):\nCu = dA\ndP =\nd πr2\n(\n)\ndP\n= 2πr0\ndr\ndP\n(12)\nCu =\n2πr0\nEh\nr0\n-P\n\n(13)\nIn most situations the denominator may be simplified by neglecting P, since Eh\nr0\nis the\ndominant term. For example, if h\nr0\n≈0.1 and E = 107\nEh\nr0\n≈106 dynes/cm2\nP ≈100 mmHg = 133,000 dynes/cm2\nSo,\nCu ≈2πr0\nEh\n3.\nElectrical/Mechanical Analysis\nIt is often useful to use electrical analogies and symbols for fluid variables. A table of such\ncorresponding variables is presented in Table 3 below.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n\nTable 3\n\nFluid Variable\nElectrical Variable\n\nPressure, P\nVoltage, e\nFlow, Q\nCurrent, i\nVolume, V\nCharge, q\nResistance, R = ∆P/Q\nResistance, R = ∆e/i\nCapacitance, C = ∆V/∆P\nCapacitance, C = ∆q/∆e\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nD.\nA Lumped Parameter Model of the Peripheral Circulation\nFigure 7 represents the same circulatory segment as Figure 1 using electrical symbolism:\nFigure 7\nQ\nPa\nPf\nPv\nRv\nCv\nRa\nCa\nIn the figure, Ca represents the equivalent capacitance of the arteries, and Cv the total\ncapacitance of all the veins in the circulation under consideration. Ra is the \"peripheral\" resistance,\nand Rv the resistance to venous flow. Q is the mean flow rate, Pa the arterial transmural pressure,\nPv the venous transmural pressure, and Pf the right atrial or \"filling\" pressure.\nTypical values for each of the components for an adult human are as follows:\nWe now proceed to an analysis of the model of Figure 7. Specifically, we would like to establish\nthe relationship between the mean flow rate through the vasculature, Q, and the right atrial filling\npressure, Pf. The reasons for the choice of these parameters will become clearer after discussing\nventricular function, but it is obvious that we could equally well choose other variables to relate if\ndesired.\nWe will designate by Vt the total volume of blood in the peripheral circulation. This\nrepresents approximately 85% of the total blood volume. The remaining fifteen percent resides in\nthe heart and pulmonary circulation. Of the total blood volume in the peripheral circulation, an\namount V0 is required just to fill the undistended system before any transmural pressure is\nTable 4\nRepresentative Values for Lumped Parameter Model\n\nCa = 2 ml/mmHg\nCv = 100 ml/mmHg\nRa = 1 mmHg/ml/sec.\nRv = .06 mmHg/ml/sec.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\ndeveloped. V0 is known as the \"zero-pressure filling volume\", or the \"non-stressed volume\".\nThe pressure-volume relationships of the arterial and venous systems are plotted below in Figure 8.\nThe figure also shows the effects of varying amounts of sympathetic nervous tone. (Increase in\nsympathetic tone causes vascular smooth muscle to contract, thus shrinking the size of blood\nvessels.)\nFigure 8\nThe volumes stored in the arterial and venous capacitances are given by\nVa = CaPa + Va0\n(14)\nVv = CvPv + Vv0\n(15)\nThe total blood volume in the peripheral circulation is fixed at Vt,\nVt = Va + Vv = CaPa + CvPv + V0\n(16)\nNormal volume\nNormal\nvolume\nSympathetic stimulation\nSympathetic stimulation\nArterial system\nSympathetic inhibition\nVenous system\nInhibition\nVolume (ml)\nPressure (mm Hg)\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Guyton. Human Physiology and Mechanisms of Disease. 3rd ed. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders, 1982.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nV0 is on the order of 3,000 ml in the adult (500 cc. in Va0, and 2500 cc. in Vv0).Vt is\napproximately 4,000 ml. During each cardiac cycle, a stroke volume ∆V enters the arterial system\nand an equal quantity leaves the peripheral vasculature through the venous system to enter the right\nheart. ∆V is small compared to Vt - V0. (∆V ≈ 80 cc.)\nIn steady state if the mean flow is Q, then there will be a pressure drop across each\nresistance such that\nPa -Pv = QRa\n(17)\nPv -Pf = QRv\n(18)\nSuppose the flow were to go to zero. Now all the pressure gradients would disappear, the volume\nwould adjust itself in arteries and veins accordingly, and there would be a mean systemic filling\npressure, Pms, observed at all points.\nPa = Pv = Pf = Pms\nSince now both capacitances are at the same pressure, we have:\nVa = CaPms + Va0\nVv = CvPms + Vv0\nand\nVt = Pms Ca + Cv\n(\n) + Va0 + Vv0\n(\n)\n(19)\nNote that\nPms = Vt -Va0 + Vv0\n(\n)\nCa + Cv\n= Vt -V0\nCt\n(20)\nwhere Ct is the total capacitance of both arteries and veins. Thus Pms is an intrinsic property of\nthe vascular network provided the blood volume and vascular capacitance (vascular tone) are kept\nconstant. Pms is the ratio of total distending volume (Vt - V0) to total systemic capacitance.\nWe will now derive an expression relating the flow, Q, to the filling pressure, Pf and the\nmean systemic filling pressure Pms.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFrom Eqs. (17) and (18) or from inspection of the circuit we have:\nQ = Pa -Pf\nRa + Rv\n(21)\nPa may be related to Pms by combining eqs. (16) and (20)\nCaPa + CvPv = Pms Ca + Cv\n(\n)\nUsing eq. (17), we have:\nCaPa + Cv Pa -QRa\n(\n) = Pms Ca + Cv\n(\n)\nPa Ca + Cv\n(\n) -QRaCv = Pms Ca + Cv\n(\n)\nPa = Pms + QRa\nCv\nCa + Cv\n(22)\nSubstituting (22) into (21) and rearranging, we obtain:\nQ =\nPms -Pf\nRv + Ra\nCa\nCa + Cv\n\n(23)\nEquation (23) relates flow to filling pressure and includes Pms (a basic property of the system) and\nthe Rs and Cs. From the table of representative values given in Table 4 above it can be seen that the\nsecond term in the denominator is the same order of magnitude as the first term.\nIt should be noted that if Pf is lowered below atmospheric pressure, the veins entering the\nthorax will collapse. Hence, venous return to the heart cannot be increased by negative filling\npressures. (This is the same phenomenon as trying to suck fluid up through a collapsible straw.\nThe collapse of veins is readily observed in the neck veins, and the veins on the dorsum of the\nhands.) The venous return at 0 mmHg tends to be maintained for Pf ≤ 0.\nAs early as 19l4, Starling (Patterson and Starling 1914) made use of the collapse\nphenomenon in his isolated heart-lung preparation (\"Starling resistors\"). The first theoretical and\nexperimental studies of flow through collapsible tubing were done by Holt (1941, 1969). He used\nthe apparatus shown below (Figure 9a), and measured the flow, Q, through a section of collapsible\ntube as a function of the pressure just proximal to the segment (P1), the pressure just distal to the\nsegment (P2), and the pressure external to the segment, Pe. A typical experimental result is shown\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nin Figure 9b, which relates flow to P2 when Pe and P1 are held constant. For downstream pressures\nexceeding the external pressure (P2 > Pe) the vessel is open throughout its length, and the slope of\nthe line is determined by the flow resistance of the open cylindrical tube. For downstream\npressures less than the external pressure, the flow is independent of P2, and is determined by P1 -\nPe. (For more discussion of flow through collapsible tubes, see Caro et al. 1978, 460ff, or Fung\n1984, 186ff).\nFigure 9\nDiagram of Holt's experimental set-up (1941) to investigate flow in collapsible tubes.

Thus, interventions that change peripheral resistance, Ra, or the venous return\nresistance Rv (such as compressing the large veins) will cause only a slope change (Figs. 11 and\n12 show idealized human curves, and actual experimental data from dogs.)\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 11\n(Idealized curves for humans)\nCalculated effects on the venous return curve caused by a two fold increase or a two fold decrease in total peripheral\nresistance when the resistances throughout the systemic circulation are all altered proportionately.

Frank (Frank 1888). It is a\nsimplified model which represents the circulation as a compliant system of major vessels in which\nnegligible frictional losses are present, and a terminal vascular resistance (the microcirculation). It\nis instructive here to discuss the expected behavior of the simple Windkessel model for the\nperipheral circulation if it is driven with a \"heart\" modelled as a periodic flow impulse generator\nthat ejects stroke volumes of ∆V. (See Figure 17.)\nFigure 17\nUsing this model, it is possible to express the arterial pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean)\nin terms of the model parameters, and to observe the dependence of these pressures on stroke\nvolume, heart rate, arterial capacitance, and peripheral resistance.\nIf the systems starts at t = 0 with no volume in the capacitance vessels, the pressure\nwaveform will build up over time as shown in Figure 18.\nFigure 18\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nThe initial stroke volume will be instantaneously deposited in the arterial capacitance, and\narterial pressure will rise by ∆V Ca . The pressure will then decay exponentially, with a time\nconstant τ = RaCa as the volume leaves the capacitor through the peripheral resistance, Ra. Before\nthe pressure reaches zero the next impulse of volume is \"dumped\" into the capacitor, again raising\nthe pressure by an amount ∆V Ca . Eventually the system will reach equilibrium when the volume\ndeposited in the capacitance per beat is exactly matched by the volume leaving the capacitor through\nthe peripheral resistance. We may make use of this requirement of equilibrium to solve the system\nfor the maximum, minimum, and mean arterial pressures in terms of the stroke volume, ∆V, the\ntime between impulses, T, and the properties of the circulation, Ra and Ca.\nIn steady state, the increment in pressure corresponding to the sudden dumping of ∆V\nonto Ca will be ∆V Ca . In the time, T, during which Ca discharges exponentially through Ra, the\npressure must drop an equal amount.\nIf the steady-state peak pressure is Ps (systolic pressure), the minimal (diastolic) pressure T\nseconds later would be\nPd = Pse-T RaCa\nHence, the pressure decrease would be\nPs 1-e-T RaCa\n(\n)\nSetting this quantity equal to ∆V Ca , we have:\nPs 1-e-T RaCa\n(\n) = ∆V\nCa\n(24)\nThus, systolic pressure is given by:\nPs = ∆V\nCa\n⋅\n1-e-T RaCa\n(\n)\n(25)\nDuring the intervals, nT < t < (n + 1)T, the expression for arterial pressure then becomes\nPa t( ) = ∆V\nCa\n⋅e-t-nt\n(\n) RaCa\n1-e-T RaCa\n(\n)\n(26)\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nDiastolic Pressure\nPd = ∆V\nCa\n⋅\ne-T RaCa\n1-e-T RaCa\n(\n)\n(27)\nPulse Pressure\nPs -Pd = ∆V\nCa\n(28)\nThe mean pressure Pa is simply the product of the average flow, ∆V T, and the resistance, Ra.\nThus:\nPa = ∆V\nT ⋅Ra\n= ∆V\n60 ⋅f ⋅Ra (f ≡ beats per minute)\n(29)\nSeveral points are worth observing from the above expressions--first, the mean arterial\npressure is directly proportional to heart rate, stroke volume, and peripheral resistance, as would be\nexpected. Since stroke volume times heart rate equals cardiac output, Equation (29) simply states\nthat the mean arterial pressure equals the product of cardiac output and peripheral resistance.\nExamination of Equation (28) reveals that the pulse pressure is directly proportional to the\nstroke volume and inversely proportional to arterial capacitance. What does this imply for patients\nwith severe arteriosclerotic vascular disease with pipe-like arteries? Does it suggest a simple\napproximate technique to monitor stroke volume?\nThe exponential decay during diastole is a realistic representation of the pressure in the\nhuman aorta. Using our typical values of Ra ≈ 1 mmHg/ml/sec. and Ca ≈ 2 ml/mmHg, the time\nconstant for the decay is about 2 sec. Figure 19 shows the intrarterial blood pressure and flow\nmeasured in the rabbit aorta. At t = 2.5 sec. the heart is stopped with vagal stimulation, and the\nblood pressure falls exponentially, consistent with the Windkessel model.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 19\nOriginal Pressure\nOriginal Flow\n1.5\n2.5\n3.5\n-20\nTime (second)\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nII.\nTHE HEART AS A PUMP\nA.\nIntroduction\nThe performance of the heart as a pump is dependent primarily upon the contraction and\nrelaxation properties of the heart muscle cells (myocardium). Other factors must also be\nconsidered such as: the geometric organization of these cells, the presence of connective tissue, the\nheart's electrical rhythm, and valve function. In this section we will examine the mechanical\nfunction of the intact heart and its cellular basis. We will then present a simple model for the heart-\npump and explore the interaction between the heart and peripheral circulation.\nThe heart is a hollow chamber whose walls consist of a mechanical syncytium of\nmyocardial cells. Figure 20 shows the structure of the myocardium at various levels of detail.\nNotice that cardiac muscle is very similar in structure to skeletal muscle, particularly with regard to\nthe sarcomere organization.\n1.\nThe Length-Tension Relationship\nThe biochemical events leading to contraction are similar in skeletal and cardiac muscle.\nThe theory most generally accepted is the sliding filament hypothesis, in which contractile force is\ndeveloped as cross-bridges form between thick and thin filaments in the sarcomeres. Calcium is the\ntrigger for this process as it is released into the cell cytoplasm following an action potential.\nRelaxation of the muscle occurs as calcium is actively removed from the region of the contractile\napparatus by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. (Students who are not familiar with muscle physiology\nshould read chapters 17-18 of Berne and Levy. The biochemical details of electrical excitation-\ncontraction coupling are reviewed in detail in Katz 1992 and Opie 1998, chapter 8.)\nThe total force generated by a contracting muscle is a function of the degree of overlap\nbetween thick and thin filaments, and hence contractile force will be a function of muscle length.\nThe classical findings relating skeletal muscle length and developed tension are shown in Figure\n21.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 20 - Myocardial Structure\nMyocardial structure, as seen under the light and electron microscopes, is schematized. Top drawing shows section\nof myocardium as it would appear under light microscope, with interconnecting fibers or cells attached end-to-end and\ndelimited by modified cell membranes called intercalated disks. Ultrastructural schematization (center drawing)\nillustrates the division of the fiber longitudinally in to rodlike fibrils, in turn composed of sarcomeres, the basic\ncontractile units. Within the sarcomeres, thick filaments of myosin, confined to the central dark A band, alternate\nwith thin filaments of actin which extend from the A lines (delimiting the sarcomere) through the I band and into the\nA band where they overlap the myosin filaments. These landmarks are seen in detail drawings (bottom). On\nactivation a repetitive interaction between the sites shown displaces the filaments inward so that the sarcomere and\nhence the whole muscle shortens, with maximum overlap at 2.2μ. Also depicted are the membranous systems: the\nT system that carries electrical activity into the cells and the sarcoplasmic reticulum that releases calcium to activate\nthe contractile machinery. Like the intercalated disks, these are specialized extensions of the superficial sarcolemma.\nNote also the rich mitochondrial content, typical of \"red\" muscle, which is highly dependent on aerobic metabolism.\n(From Braunwald, Ross, and Sonnenblick 1976).\nFigure by MIT OCW.

At a sarcomere length shorter than 2.0μ (4) thin filaments pass into the opposite half of the\nsarcomere and a double overlap occurs (5 and 6). Note that the central 0.2μ of the thick filament is devoid of cross-\nbridges which could interact with sites on the think filaments.

Little-Brown, 1976.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 22\nEffect of Sarcomere Length on Tension\nThe relationship between sarcomere lengths and tension for cardiac muscle in comparison with skeletal muscle.\nNote (i) the effect of increasing calcium ion concentration and (ii) the absence of any decrease of tension at maximal\nsarcomere lengths so that there is no basis for the descending limb of the Starling curve. Recent sophisticated laser-\ndiffraction techniques invalidate previous curves based on apparent sarcomere length-tension relationships of\nimperfect papillary muscle preparations. For data on failing human heart, see Holubarsch et al. (1996). (From\nOpie 1998.)\nNote that at sarcomere lengths greater than 3.65 microns developed tension is zero--presumably\nbecause there is no overlap between thick and thin filaments. The overlap increases as length\ndecreases to 2.2 microns, and tension increases proportionately. As the sarcomere length decreases\nbelow 2.0 microns, developed tension decreases. The reasons are not clear, but may be related to\nchanges in geometry, or level of \"activation\" of the contractile process.\nCardiac muscle exhibits a length-tension relationship which is not exactly the same as that\nfor skeletal muscle. Figure 22 compares the length-tension curves for skeletal muscle and cardiac\nmuscle. Both active and resting tensions are shown for isometric (constant length) contractions.\nResting tension is much greater in cardiac muscle than in skeletal muscle. In normal hearts,\nmyocardial cells cannot be stretched much beyond the peak of the length-tension curve, and\nnormally operate on the ascending limb of the curve.\nFigure 23a,b shows length tension data obtained from cat papillary muscle. The scheme of\nthe experimental apparatus is shown in Figure 23a. In its fully relaxed state the muscle exhibits the\nlength-tension relationship shown in the \"passive\" curve of Figure 23b. It behaves as a non-linear\nspring. As the muscle reaches longer lengths it becomes increasingly stiff. The passive length-\ntension relationship is determined by the mechanical properties of the muscle cells and the\nassociated connective tissue which is part of the muscle.\n1.2\nSarcomere length (microns)\nTension (% of maximum)\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.8\nCa2 + 2.5\nLength-tension\nrelation\nCa2 + 1.25\nCa2 + 0.3\nCardiac\nCardiac\nResting tension\nSkeletal\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Opie, 1998.\n,\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nIf the muscle contracts from a particular resting length and tension, it will develop active\ntension. Maximum tension will occur if the length of the muscle is fixed (isometric contraction).\nThe active tension is a function of the initial resting tension (the preload). Higher developed tension\nis generated from longer resting lengths, and vice versa. The active tension curve in Figure 23b is a\nplot of active tension versus resting muscle length.\nWhat happens if the muscle is allowed to shorten during the contraction phase? When the\ntension developed by the muscle reaches the afterload determined by the weight, the muscle will\nshorten until the final length-tension coordinates again fall on the active curve.\nA first-order model for the papillary muscle might be a two-state spring as shown in Figure\n23c. The spring constant K is low during the resting state, but is high during the active state of the\nmuscle. The resultant length-tension curves would, of course, be linear, but they do capture the\nessence of the muscle's behavior as shown in Figure 23b.\n2.\nPressure-Volume Relationships in the Ventricle\nThe intact heart exhibits mechanical behavior which resembles the length-tension behavior\nof isolated muscle. We will focus on a single ventricle. Instead of plotting tensions and lengths, it\nis much more convenient to measure and plot pressures and volumes. (One can relate\nintraventricular pressure to wall tension by appropriate application of LaPlace's law. Similarly,\nventricular volume can be related to circumference.) A plot of ventricular pressure vs. volume is\ncalled a \"ventricular function curve\" and may be drawn for both the resting phase of the cardiac\ncycle (diastole) and the actively contracting phase (systole) (Figure 24). Such data may be\nobtained by filling the ventricle to different levels and measuring both diastolic pressure and volume\nto create the diastolic curve. Points on the systolic curve may be obtained by causing the ventricle\nto contract isovolumetrically (with the aorta clamped, for example) and measuring systolic pressure.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 23\nIsolated Cardiac Muscle Experiments\nb.\na.

It has been shown in Figure 24 as a plot of maximum isovolumetric\nventricular pressure vs. end-diastolic volume.\nThe \"Law of the Heart\" may be expressed in a variety of forms. Several \"output\"\nvariables may be plotted on the ordinate including: ventricular pressure, stroke volume, cardiac\noutput, stroke work, etc. A variety of \"input\" variables may be plotted on the abscissa including:\nend-diastolic volume, end-diastolic pressure, sarcomere length, circumference, etc. All of these\nvariations may be seen in the literature, and they all express in some sense the input/output behavior\nof the ventricle as stated by Starling: \"the energy of contraction is a function of the length of the\nmuscle fiber\". This behavior of the heart is intrinsic to the myocardium itself, and is independent\nof any extrinsic neural or hormonal influences. One of the implications of Starling's Law is that\nthe \"output of the heart is equal to and determined by the amount of blood flowing into the heart,\nand may be increased or diminished within very wide limits according to the inflow\"...(Starling,\n1918).\nVd is the volume of blood in the ventricle when the transmural pressure is zero. It is\nreferred to as the \"dead volume\" or \"zero-pressure filling volume\". Vd is generally not the same\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nduring diastole and systole, as is indicated in Figure 24. Estimates of the dead volumes during\nsystole and diastole are given below in Table 5 (page 44).\nIf as shown in Figure 25 an isolated left ventricle is filled with a constant preload pressure,\nPf, and if the aorta is connected to a constant afterload pressure, Pa, a pressure-volume loop will be\ngenerated during the heart's pumping cycle, as shown in Figure 26. The cycle begins at (1) when\nthe heart is at end-diastolic pressure and volume, Pf. From 1 to 2 the ventricle contracts with no\nchange in volume (isovolumetric contraction phase) since both mitral and aortic valves are closed.\nFrom 2 to 3 the ventricular volume decreases as blood is ejected into the afterload reservoir at\nconstant pressure, Pa. Ejection continues until the systolic pressure-volume curve is reached at\npoint 3. From 3 to 4 the pressure drops during the isovolumetric relaxation phase when aortic and\nmitral valves are closed. At point 4 the mitral valve opens and filling takes place at constant\npressure, Pf, until the volume again reaches point 1 on the diastolic pressure-volume curve.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 25\nCardiac cycle with constant preload, Pf, and constant afterload, Pa\nPa\nP, v\nPf\nFigure 26\nPressure-volume loop during constant pre- and afterload\nPressure (mmHg)\nVolume (cc)\nVd\ns\nPa\nPf\nVd\nd 50\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 27\nLeft ventricular (LV), aortic, and left atrial (LA) pressure versus time\nPressure\n(mmHg)\nTime\nPa\nPf\nAorta\nLV\nLA\nFigure 28\nThe LV pressure-volume loop when the heart is attached to the aorta\nPressure\n(mmHg)\nVolume (cc)\nVd\ns Vd\nd 50\n1′\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nIf the heart functions within the intact circulation the LV preload is determined by the left\natrial pressure, and the afterload is determined by the pressure in the aorta. Figure 27 shows the\npressures in LA, LV, and aorta as a function of time. The corresponding LV pressure-volume loop\nis shown as 1-2-3-4-5 in Figure 28. (These key pressure-volume points are also indicated in\nFigure 27.)\nDuring diastole, the ventricle fills from point (5) to point (1) along its diastolic curve. The\nend-diastolic pressure at point (1) is the preload. Systole begins, and the ventricle begins to\ncontract, thus increasing its pressure, but since both mitral and aortic valves remain closed, the\nventricular volume remains constant (isovolumetric contraction). At point (2), the intraventricular\npressure exceeds aortic pressure and ejection begins. The pressure at point (2) is the afterload.1\nThe maximum pressure is reached at point (3), and is called \"systolic BP\" when measured in\narteries.\nAt the end of systole, point (4), the ventricular volume and pressure are defined by the\nsystolic ventricular function curve. Diastole then begins, with isovolumetric relaxation of the\nventricle to point (5) where filling begins again. Notice that the same amount of blood is pumped\nout of the heart during systole as enters during diastole. If diastolic flow into the heart increases\n(assume an end-diastolic volume of 170 ml), then the end-diastolic operating point would be at\n(1)′--an increased preload. If systolic ejection occurs at the same afterload, all of this blood is\nejected and the end-systolic point is again at (4). Since the stroke volume has increased, the work\nperformed by the heart during the new cycle has also increased. Note that stroke work, pdV\n∫\n, is\nsimply the area enclosed by the P-V loop.\n3. Contractility\nIn the intact organism Starling's law of the heart probably plays a rather minor role in\nchanging cardiac output to meet the varying needs of the body. The law's major value is probably\nin balancing the outputs of the right and left ventricles on a beat-by-beat basis.\nHow, then, does the body increase cardiac output to meet increased metabolic needs, as\nduring exercise, for example? Cardiac output increases dramatically, but the ventricular filling\npressure and volume typically show no increases. Rather, the ventricular pressure-volume\nrelationship actually changes so that for the same filling volume, a greater pressure is developed.\n(See Figure 29.) The heart becomes a more powerful or more \"contractile\" pump. Changes in\n1It is probably more precise to consider wall tensile stress (tension per unit cross sectional area) as the afterload\nrather than ventricular pressure. The same ventricular pressure would lead to a greater afterload if the radius of the\nheart were larger, and vice versa. If we consider wall thickness as well, then hypertrophy may actually reduce the\nafterload of individual fibers.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\ncardiac contractility are mediated by physiologic signals extrinsic to the heart that are carried by the\nautonomic nervous system, hormones, or by drugs. Contractility changes may also be caused by\ndisease.\nFigure 29 illustrates how changes in contractility result in shifts of the ventricular end-\nsystolic function curve.\nFigure 29\nIncreasing\nContractility\nB\nA\nC\nD\nDecreasing\nContractility\nDiastolic\nFilling Curve\nVentricular Volume\nVentricular Pressure\nV2\nV0\nV1\nV3\nP0\nP1\nP3\nP4\nA shift in the curve upward and to the left represents an increase in contractility and vice\nversa. Notice that we may cause an increase in isovolumetric end systolic pressure by moving\nalong curve 1 from A to B. This corresponds, of course, to increasing the preload from P0 to P1,\nand involves no change in cardiac contractility. If, by virtue of an extrinsic influence on the heart,\nventricular contractility increases (curve 2), the same increase in systolic pressure may be achieved\nat a net decrease in filling pressure (point C). In general, changes in contractility occur in the intact\nanimal to meet changes in demands. Extrinsic influences may also decrease contractility (curve 3).\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nIn this case, a large increase in preload would be required just to maintain the same end systolic\npressure (point D). Disease and certain drugs may cause such decreases in contractility. Any\nagent causing an increase in contractility is called a positive inotropic agent and vice versa.\nThe diastolic pressure-volume curve is a measure of the mechanical stiffness of the heart\nduring its resting phase. The relaxation of muscle follows the active removal of calcium ions from\nthe region of the contractile apparatus by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, it is an energy-\nrequiring process. The diastolic properties of the heart may be significantly affected by a variety of\npathologic conditions which alter the mechanical properties of the ventricle either through changes\nin structure (constrictive pericardial disease, cardiac tamondade, dilated cardiomyopathy, etc.) or\nfunction (ischemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). For example, Figure 30 illustrates the increase\nin diastolic stiffness associated with transient lack of blood flow to the heart due to coronary artery\ndisease. The increase in diastolic stiffness reflects a relative lack of ATP that is required for muscle\nrelaxation.\nFigure 30\nLeft ventricular diastolic pressure-volume plots in control (open circles) and post-pacing (closed circles) periods in a\npatient with coronary heart disease who developed angina during atrial pacing. The entire diastolic pressure-volume\nrelationship is shifted upward, so that pressure is higher at any given volume.

The model must also reflect the concept of\n\"contractility\". Our model is based on the work of Defares (Defares, Osborn, and Hara 1963),\nwhich was subsequently elaborated by Prof. Kiichi Sagawa and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins.\nSagawa has written an excellent review of ventricular models (Sagawa 1973), including that of\nDefares.\n1.\nThe Variable Capacitor Model\nBefore going to the modeling, an examination of some experimental data is necessary.\nFigure 25 shows a series of pressure-volume loops from a denervated canine left ventricle obtained\nunder different conditions of preload and afterload, but during a constant contractile state.\nFigure 31\nNotice that during diastole, there is an approximate straight-line relationship between\npressure and volume. At zero pressure the line crosses the volume axis at Vd, the residual (or\n\"dead\") volume of the ventricle when the transmural pressure is zero. Note also from Figure 31\nVentricular volume (ML)\nVentricular pressure (mmHg)\nVd\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Suga and Sagawa 1972.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nthat the end-systolic points fall on a straight line which has the same volume intercept,2 but a much\nlarger slope.\nThis experimental data suggests that we may consider the left ventricle as a 2-state device.\nIn diastole it behaves as an elastic chamber (a capacitor) whose properties may be represented by\nthe diastolic pressure-volume curve shown in Figure 26. In the physiologic range, the curve is a\nstraight line, and its equation would be:\nV = Vd + CDP\n(30)\nNote that CD = ∆V ∆P, and is termed the diastolic capacitance (or compliance) of the ventricle.\nSimilarly, during systole the heart may be represented as a capacitor with value, CS. The pressure\nvolume relation would be:\nV = Vd + CSP\n(31)\nThis relation is plotted as the systolic curve of Figure 32. Notice that at high diastolic filling\npressures the diastolic pressure-volume curve is no longer linear. This occurs, however, at diastolic\nfilling pressures greater than about 20mmHg, which is above the normal physiologic range, and\nwhere cardiac dilatation begins to be limited by collagenous tissue and pericardium. Approximate\nvalues of the capacitances and dead volume for dog and man are shown in Table 5.\n2Note: for simplicity we will assume that the dead volume, Vd, is identical for diastole and for systole.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 32\nSchematic Ventricular Pressure-Volume Relations\nSo far we have considered the ventricle to be a discrete two-state device with instantaneous\ntransitions from diastole to systole and back. In reality, of course, the properties of the ventricle\nchange continuously, and ventricular capacitance is a continuous function of time C(t), where\nC t( ) = V t( ) -Vd\nP t( )\n(32)\n\nTable 5\nApproximate Values for Capacitances and Vds for Dog and Man\n\nDog\nMan\nVd\n\n5 cc\n\n15 cc\nCD\n\n4 ml/mmHG\n\n15 ml/mmHg\nCS\n\n0.1 ml/mmHg\n\n0.4 ml/mmHg\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nThis function has been experimentally measured in dogs by Suga and Sagawa (1975). By\nmeasuring instantaneous pressure-volume relationships during systole, the function C(t) was\ncalculated, and the result is shown in Figure 33.\nFigure 33\nInstantaneous LV Capacitance, C(t) for the dog\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\nC(t)\n(ml/mmHg)\nt (msec)\nCurve calculated from data in Suga (1979).\nNotice that in this experiment C(t) decreases from its diastolic value over a 270 ms period, then\nrelaxes back to its diastolic value during the ensuing 135 ms period. The time to develop minimal\ncapacitance is approximately twice the relaxation period.\nThe instantaneous capacitance C(t) is independent of preload and afterload and\nprovides a complete quantitative description of the mechanical properties of the ventricle\nduring the cardiac cycle.\nWe will now proceed to analyze how we may utilize the instantaneous capacitance to\ncalculate the variables such as stroke volume and cardiac output.\nIn Figure 34 we plot C(t) for a number of cardiac cycles.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 34\nWe next analyze the pump function of the idealized LV when it is driven by a constant\npressure preload Pf, and when it pumps into a constant pressure afterload, Pa. To do so, consider\nthe following electric circuit model of the system.\nFigure 35\nElectrical Circuit Model of the Ventricle\nHere the open circles represent constant pressure sources. D1 is a diode representing the\natrio-ventricular valve; D2 is a diode representing the ventricular outflow valve. (A diode may be in\ntwo states: conducting and non-conducting. In the conducting state, the resistance is zero and\ncurrent may flow, and vice-versa.) \"Ground\" represents the pressure outside the ventricle which\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nwould be atmospheric pressure in the case of an isolated left ventricle or an open-chest experiment.\nThe variable capacitor represents the LV.\nPressure across the capacitor is given by\nP t( ) = V t( ) -Vd\nC t( )\n(33)\nWe now analyze the system during each phase of the cardiac cycle:\n1)\nIsovolumic Contraction. During the period of diastolic filling, the capacitor has filled to a\nlevel:\nVD = CDPf + Vd\nNow as C(t) decreases below its diastolic value of CD, P(t) will increase above Pf, and D1\nstops conducting. The Diode D2 is still non-conducting since P(t) < Pa. Therefore, no flow occurs\nand V(t) = VD. The capacitance decreases until\nC t( ) = VD -Vd\nPa\n= CDPf\nPa\nAt this point, P(t) = Pa, D2 conducts and the ejection phase begins.\n2)\nEjection Phase - D1 remains non-conducting since P(t) > Pf. D2 is conducting, and\nP(t) = Pa. The volume in the capacitor at the end of systole is given by\nVS = CSPa + Vd\n3)\nIsovolumic Relaxation - As soon as C(t) increases above its minimum value of CS, P(t)\ndrops below Pa, and D2 stops conducting. D1 will also remain non-conducting until P(t) drops to\nPf. This occurs when\nC t( ) = VS -Vd\nPf\n= CSPa\nPf\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n4)\nDiastole - During diastole the outlet diode D2 remains non-conducting since Pa > P(t).\nThe inlet diode D1 conducts and the capacitor charges with P(t) = Pf. The end diastolic volume VD\nbecomes\nVD = CDPf + Vd\nPhases 1 and 2 are usually considered part of ventricular systole; phases 3 and 4 are usually\nconsidered part of ventricular diastole. Figure 36 presents a sketch of the functions C(t), P(t) and\nV(t), while Figure 37 plots the resultant pressure-volume loop.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 36\nSketch of C(t), P(t) and V(t)\nCD\nCS\nC(t)\nt\nPa\nPf\nP(t)\nt\nCDPf\nCSPa\nV(t)\nt\nCSPa\n_____\nPf\nCDPf\n_____\nPa\nT\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 37\nCardiac Cycle in the Pressure-Volume Plane\nThe stroke volume of the ventricle is given by the difference between its end-diastolic and\nend-systolic volume.\nS.V.= VD -VS\nS.V.= CDPf -CSPa\n(34)\nThe ventricular output, V.O., is given by the heart rate, f, times the stroke volume.\nV.O.= f × S.V.\nV.O.= f CDPf -CSPa\n(\n)\n(35)\nwhere f is given by\nf = 1/T\nand T is the length of one cardiac cycle.\nThese equations for stroke volume and ventricular output were derived for constant pressure\npreload and afterload.

In particular, one must be aware that Pa\nmay differ substantially from the mean arterial pressure.\nNote that if Pf < PaCS CD , no ventricular output results. When Pf is large, we find\nexperimentally that the ventricular output curve flattens out (see Figure 38). This occurs because\nthe diastolic pressure-volume curve is not linear for large values of Pf. (See Figures 32, 39.)

It is plotted in Figure 38. This\nplot will be referred to as a ventricular function curve. Since ventricular output depends on\nafterload, Pa, as well as preload, a 3-dimensional surface is required to fully characterize ventricular\nfunction. Such a plot is shown in Figure 40, using data produced by a computational model of the\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\ncardiovascular system (courtesy of Dr. Ramakrishna Mukkamala, 2000).

Elastance is the inverse\nof compliance [e(t) = 1/C(t)]. Figure 44 shows that measurements of ventricular volume or\npressure alone cannot satisfactorily characterize ventricular contractility. At a fixed inotropic state,\nfor example, there may be wide variations in stroke volumes and developed pressures. On the other\nhand, plots of elastance (∆P/∆V) vs time reveal consistent changes with inotropic state.

One must obtain simultaneous measures of\nboth ventricular pressure and ventricular volume. In addition, these measurements must be made at\na variety of filling volumes in order to define the linear relation between end systolic\npressures and volumes which determines Cs.\nSeveral techniques have been used to achieve the required measurements. One approach\nmonitors ventricular pressure via a catheter-tipped transducer and determines ventricular volumes\nusing radionuclides.

The technique is useful in\ndocumenting relative changes in ventricular contractility induced by therapeutic maneuvers, for\nexample.

Each pump is modeled as a single variable capacitor.\nFigure 49\nDiagram of the major elements of the circulatory system.\nThe elements enclosed in the dotted rectangle are included in the \"heart-lung pumping\nunit\".\nThis simple approach ignores the atria completely, and combines the effect of the atrial kick3 into a\nsingle pumping chamber. There is good experimental data to confirm the validity of using the\nvariable capacitor model for the right heart as well as the left (Sunagawa and Sagawa 1982).\nThe pulmonary vascular bed is modeled in the same manner as the systemic bed, although\nthe properties of the pulmonary vascular resistance differ (see below).\nIt is often convenient to combine the heart (both right and left chambers) together with the\npulmonary circulation as a single functional unit. This so-called \"heart-lung pumping unit\"\nwould be described in terms of a \"cardiac\" output, Q, and a venous filling pressure, Pf. The\ninteraction of the heart-lung pumping unit with the systemic circulation is of fundamental interest\nclinically.\nHow can we characterize the heart-lung unit? It is sketched in Figure 50. The preload to\nthe heart-lung unit (HLU) is the right atrial filling pressure, Pf, and the afterload is the aortic\npressure, Pa. A rigorous derivation of the properties of the HLU would require a detailed analysis\n3Atrial contraction does contribute to the efficiency of the heart by increasing the ventricular end-diastolic pressure.\nThe atrial \"kick\" may increase cardiac output by 15-20% under certain conditions of severe cardiac demand.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nof the pulmonary circulation. A simplified and somewhat qualitative approach will be developed\nhere.\nFigure 50\nThe Heart-Lung Pumping Unit\nThe right ventricle and pulmonary circuit are a low-pressure system. Normal mean\npulmonary artery pressure, PPA, is approximately 15 mmHg. The pulmonary vascular bed changes\nits resistance significantly as a function of flow rate. As the pulmonary artery flow increases (as a\nresult of somewhat higher driving pressures), its resistance decreases. The reason for this behavior\nis probably that multiple possible parallel pathways for blood flow exist in the pulmonary bed. As\nflow increases, more parallel branches are recruited, thus lowering resistance. In addition, the\nvessels dilate with increasing transmural pressure, also decreasing resistance to flow. Recruitment\nand dilation of vessels also occurs as the left atrial pressure increases. Permutt (see Sagawa 1973,\np. 46) suggested a model for the pulmonary vascular bed which consisted of a parallel array of thin-\nwalled collapsible tubes (Starling resistors). Alveolar pressure was the pressure external to the\ncollapsible segments. This model predicted a relationship between pulmonary vascular resistance\nand pulmonary arterial pressure which was highly non-linear. (See Figure 51a.) Experimental data\n(Figure 51b) seem to confirm this model.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 51\nPLA\nPpa (cmH20)\nPVR\ncmH20\nL/min\n(\n(\ninf\n0.0437\n0.0250\n0.0200\n0.0150\n0.0100\n0.0050\nLA 5.9-6.2 mmHg\nLA 7.9-8.7 mmHg\nLA 13.5-16 mmHg\nRight Pulmonary Artery Pressure (mmHg)\n∆ P/F\nmmHg\nml/min\n(\n(\nA.

Compare the effect of left atrial pressure (LA) on the\nrelationship curve with that simulated by Permutt's model in Figure 51a. Palv = 5 mm Hg. (From Permutt et al.,\n1962).\nBecause of the non-linear behavior of the pulmonary resistance, the pulmonary artery\npressure is less sensitive to net blood flow than would be expected with a constant pulmonary\nvascular resistance. In addition, the relationship between pulmonary flow and pulmonary artery\npressure (or pressure gradient) is non-linear. Figure 52 demontrates the non-linearities in the flow\nvs. pressure curve for dog lung.\nPulmonary artery pressure is also relatively insensitive to changes in left atrial pressure, up\nto LA pressures of 7-10 mmHg. (See Figure 53.) This is because as LA pressure increases,\npulmonary vascular resistance decreases (recall Figure 50).\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 52\nExperimental data and theoretical curves relating pulmonary flow and resistance to pulmonary pressure gradient. The\nexperimental data are from an isolated dog lung with pulmonary venous pressure fixed at 3 cm H2O, pleural pressure\nequal to zero, and three different alveolar pressures: 23, 17, and 7 cm H2O. The theoretical curves are based on a\nmodel of pulmonary alveolar flow developed by Fung (see Fung 1984, ch. 6).\nFigure 53\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.

After Guyton.\nEffect of left atrial pressure on pulmonary arterial pressure.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nSince the pulmonary artery pressure changes little over wide ranges of flow, we will\nconsider it to be constant. Thus, the afterload, PPA, of the right heart is constant, and the RV output\nis determined only by the properties of the right ventricle, and the RV filling pressure, Pf. In steady\nstate the LV output must exactly match that of the RV. The left atrial pressure adjusts to the proper\nvalue such that the stroke volume of the LV equals that of the RV. Therefore, the output of the\nHLU (referred to as the cardiac output), will be\nC.O.= f CD\nr Pf -CS\nr PPA\n(\n)\n(38)\nwhere f is the heart rate in beats per minute, Pf is the filling pressure, PPA is the pulmonary artery\npressure, and CD\nr , CS\nr are the diastolic and systolic capacitances of the RV respectively. C.O. is in\ncc/min.\nNotice that the cardiac output is relatively independent of the left ventricular afterload. For\nexample, if the mean aortic pressure were to double from 100 mmHg to 200 mmHg, the left atrial\npressure would have to rise by only 3 mmHg (using values for cardiac capacitances given in the\ntable of normal values at the end of this section). This small rise in LA pressure would increase the\npulmonary artery pressure even less due to a decrease in pulmonary artrery resistance. The\nresultant change in RV output would be only about 5%.\nHowever, there is a limit to the extent to which increasing left atrial pressure will increase\nleft ventricular output. The left ventricle cannot be filled beyond some maximum volume, Vmax.\nThis limiting volume may be set by the mechanical properties of the ventricular\nmyocardium/pericardium, but in practice the maximal LV filling pressure is established when the\nLA pressure reaches the \"pulmonary edema\" threshold. At pressures higher than about 30\nmmHg, the hydrostatic pressure forcing fluid out of pulmonary capillaries exceeds the oncotic\npressure keeping fluid within the vasculature. Water then passes out of the capillaries into the\ninterstitial space, and actually into the alveoli of the lung, leading to the condition known as\npulmonary edema. When this condition occurs, gas exchange in the lung becomes impaired, the\nblood becomes hypoxic, and ventricular function deteriorates still more, which leads to still higher\nLA pressures and more pulmonary edema. This vicious circle is incompatible with survival unless\npromptly treated.\nWhen the LV diastolic volume reaches the maximum, then stroke volume cannot exceed\nSVmax = Vmax\nl\n-CS\nl Pa\n(39)\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nA plot of cardiac output as a function of systemic arterial pressure, Pa, is of the following\nform:\nFigure 54\nAt low and normal systemic arterial pressures, the RV determines cardiac output\nindependent of Pa. When the C.O. reaches f Vmax\nl\n-CS\nl Pa\n(\n), however, the LV begins to limit\ncardiac output because of its filling limitation. The LA pressure rises, causing concommitant rises\nin PA pressure, which limits RV output to that set by the left ventricle. Notice that as the LV\ncontractility decreases (increasing CS) the limiting cardiac output drops. Thus, the LV will limit\ncardiac output either at extremely high afterloads, or when LV contractility falls.\nThe equations which characterize the heart-lung-unit are shown below.\nI.\nRange I: Cardiac Output determined by RV Function\nC.O.= f CD\nr Pf -CS\nr PPA\n(\n)\n(40)\nwhen Pf < Vmax\nr\nCD\nr\n,\nand Pa < 1\nCS\nl\nVmax\nl\n-C.O.\nf\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nor Pa < 1\nCS\nl Vmax\nl\n-CD\nr Pf + CS\nr PPA\n(\n)\nII.\nRange II: RV Saturates\nC.O.= f Vmax -CS\nr PPA\n(\n)\n(41)\nwhen Pf ≥Vmax\nr\nCD\nr\n,\nand Pa < 1\nCS\nl Vmax\nl\n-Vmax\nr\n+ CS\nr PPA\n(\n)\nIII.\nRange III: LV Limits C.O.

In range II\nthe RV diastolic filling is maximum, hence the C.O. saturates (assuming PPA is constant). In\nrange III the C.O. is limited by the left ventricle. Normally the cardiovascular system operates\nin range I.\nThe equations above may be represented as a three-dimensional plot of C.O. as a function\nof Pf and Pa. An experimental plot of this sort is shown in Figure 55. The data is from open-\nchested dogs. The three operating ranges have been indicated on the curves, and show that\nexperimental data seem to fit our simple model reasonably well. Note that for the experimental\ndata, cardiac output was independent of mean aortic pressure up to about 150 mmHg.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 55\nCardiac output as a function of filling pressure and afterload (dog data)\n[Data from Herndon & Sagawa, 1969; figure from Guyton, Jones, and Coleman, 1973.]\n2.\nEffect of Intrathoracic Pressure\nUp to now we have treated the heart as it would behave in an open-chested animal. In the\nintact organism, mean intrathoracic pressure is about 6 mmHg less than atmospheric pressure. The\nheart senses only transmural pressures. For the same intracardiac pressure relative to atmospheric\npressure, the effective transmural pressure is 6 mmHg greater in the closed-chested animal than in\nthe open-chested animal. This effect is particularly pronounced with respect to diastolic filling\npressures since these pressures are normally only a few mm of Hg to start off with. Figure 56\nexplicitly includes the transthoracic pressure into the variable capacitor model.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 56\nElectric Circuit Incorporation of Transthoracic Pressure\ninto Variable Capacitor Model.\nFigure 57 shows three cardiac output curves (at constant afterload) at different transthoracic\npressures for humans. In particular, we note that for the normal closed-chest situation there is a\nsubstantial cardiac output of approximately 5 L/min at zero right atrial pressure (relative to\natmospheric pressure). This is the normal operating point in the closed-chest subject.\nFigure 57\nEffect on the cardiac output curve of negative pressure breathing, positive pressure\nbreathing, and opening the chest to atmospheric pressure.\nDr. Arthur Guyton has obtained considerable data on the behavior of cardiac output curves,\nand students are urged to read his text, \"Circulatory Physiology: Cardiac Output and its\nRegulation\": Section II (Guyton 1973.)

These models both relate blood flow, Q, to the filling pressure of the right heart, Pf.\nThe two models may be combined as shown in Figure 60.\nFigure 60\nSince the Qs and Pfs are identical, we may now solve for the steady-state \"operating point\" of the\nentire system. Either analytical or graphical techniques may be used. In our analysis we will\nconsider mean pressures, flows, and volumes.\nB.\nNormal Functioning of the Cardiovascular System\nThe equation describing the heart-lung unit in Range I was given in equation 40 above, and\nis reproduced here.

Using the\ntable of normal values in Table 6 (at the end of the chapter), we find:\nC.O. (cc / sec.) =\n8 + 5 -1.5\n.06+.02+.05\n= 84.6 cc / sec.\n= 5.07 L / min.\n(45)\nBased on equation 45 we may examine the principal determinants of the cardiac output in\nthe normal physiologic range.\n1.\nHeart Rate. Cardiac output increases asymptotically with heart rate in this model.\nNotice that if the heart rate goes to zero, the last term in the denominator goes to infinity and\nC.O. goes to zero. As heart rate gets very large, this term gets vanishingly small and\ncardiac output reaches an asymptotic value of 8.6 L/min. in our case. (Note that our model\ndoes not take account of the drop in C.O. as filling time decreases.)\n2.\nMean Systemic Pressure, Pms. This term is the largest in the numerator, and is a\nmajor determinant of cardiac output. Since Pms is the ratio of distending blood volume to\ntotal systemic capacitance, a change in either of these factors will alter Pms and hence cardiac\noutput. Increasing blood volume, decreasing venous capacitance, or decreasing venous\nzero-pressure filling volume will lead to increased C.O.\n3.\nIntrathoracic Pressure, Pth. This term is an important one, and makes a major\ncontribution to cardiac output by virtue of its action on cardiac filling. (You should know\nwhat happens in a Valsalva maneuver.)\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n4.\nVenous Capacitance, Cv. This term appears explicitly in the second term in the\ndenominator (a small term) and implicitly in the definition of Pms in the numerator. As Cv\nincreases, C.O. decreases.\n5.\nRight Ventricular Diastolic Capacitance, CD\nr . Increasing CD\nr will increase the\nnumerator and decrease the denominator, hence increasing cardiac output (in a saturating\nmanner). (Generally this variable will not change, however.)\n6.\nArterial Resistance. Varying Ra has only a small effect on C.O. Ra enters only the\nsmall second term in the denominator. What effect does Ra have on Pa?\n7.\nArterial Capacitance, Ca. Since Ca << Cv, Ca essentially enters the second term of\nthe denominator in the form RaCa. Varying Ca will have a rather small effect on C.O.\n8.\nVenous Resistance, Rv. Increasing Rv dramatically increases the first term of the\ndenominator, and drops C.O.\n9.\nInotropy of the Ventricles. Under normal conditions the cardiac output is weakly\ndependent on Cs\nr and completely independent of Cs\nl. This reflects the fact that the\ncontractility of the ventricles is not the major factor limiting cardiac output; rather it is the\ndiastolic filling of the RV.\nC.\nCardiac Output Under Abnormal Conditions\nWe now consider the abnormal operating ranges of the heart-lung pump.\n1.\nRange II\nRange II is defined by maximum filling of the right ventricle\nPf -Pth ≥Vmax\nr\nCD\nr\n,\nand Pa < Vmax\nl\n-S.V.\nCS\nl\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nIn this range the left ventricular output is not constrained, but the R.V. has fixed output which\ndetermines overall C.O.\nC.O.= f Vmax\nr\n-CS\nr PPA -Pth\n(\n)\n[\n]\n(46)\n2.\nRange III\nThe system is in range III when the left ventricle is the limiting chamber in determining\ncardiac output. From equation 36 the maximum stroke volume obtainable from the L.V. is given\nby:\nS.V. max = Vmax\nl\n-CS\nl Pa\nThus, when\nPa > 1\nCS\nl Vmax\nl\n-S.V.\n(\n)\n(47)\nThe L.V limits cardiac output to:\nC.O.= f Vmax\nl\n-CS\nl PPA\n(\n)\n(48)\nBut\nPa = Pv + Ra + Rv\n(\n)(C.O.)\nIf we simplify this relationship by ignoring Pv and assuming Rv << Ra we obtain\nPa ≅C.O.\n(\n) Ra\n(\n)\n(49)\nSubstituting (49) into (48) we obtain\nC.O.=\nfVmax\nl\n1+ fCS\nl Ra\n(\n)\n(50)\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nThus, under conditions of LV-limited cardiac output, the cardiac output is a function of LV\ncontractility, CS\nl ; peripheral arterial resistance Ra; and heart rate, f. Note that C.O. increases\nasymptotically with increasing heart rate; decreases with increasing CS or Ra. (See Figure 61.)\nInequality (47) is satisfied at either extremely high systemic pressures, or more commonly in left\nventricular failure when CS becomes larger than normal.\nIt is under these conditions that \"afterload reduction\" (decrease in Ra) is effective in\nincreasing cardiac output.\nFigure 61\nCardiac Output when limited by L.V. (Range III)\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nD.\nGraphical Solution\n1.\nOperating Point Analysis\nThe graphical solution for the steady-state operating point of the intact circulation makes\nuse of the \"venous return\" and \"cardiac output\" curves, and was introduced by Dr. Arthur\nGuyton. Figure 62 shows normal cardiac output and venous return curves. The point of\nintersection is the operating point. Note that the steady state operating point is at a C.O. of 5\nliters/min. and a right atrial pressure of 0 mmHg (referenced to atmosphere in a closed-chest\nindividual).\nFigure 62\nIn the following section, we will illustrate the use of Guyton's graphical technique to analyze\nseveral specific physiological states.\n2.\nSympathetic Stimulation\n- Sympathetic stimulation has rather little effect on resistance to venous return, Rv.\n-4\nRight Atrial Pressure (mm.Hg)\nCardiac Output and Venous Return\n(liters/min.)\nCardiac output\n(normally)\nVenous return\n(normally)\nEquilibrium Point\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Guyton (1973), Fig. 14-1.\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\n- Sympathetic stimulation causes constriction of veins with a decrease in zero-pressure\nfilling volume, and increased mean systemic filling pressure--hence, moves venous return\ncurves up and to the right.\n- Sympathetic stimulation increases peripheral resistance, and the slope of the venous return\ncurve decreases. This is a small effect compared to the change in Pms, however.\n- Sympathetic stimulation changes the cardiac output curves by shifting to the left and\nincreasing the slope. This is due to increases in both contractility and heart rate.\nFigure 63 illustrates an analysis for the combined effects of sympathetic stimulation on both\ncardiac and peripheral factors. The normal operating point is at A, while with increased sympathetic\ntone, the operating point moves from A to C, and then to D. Notice that despite the increase in\ncardiac output, RA pressure drops. These curves do not show arterial blood pressure. What would\nyou expect to happen to blood pressure under intense sympathetic stimulation?\n\nCardiovascular Mechanics\nFigure 63\n3.\nTissue Oxygen Need\nHypoxia leads to vasodilation. Thus, if a vascular bed is perfused with blood with an O2\nsaturation of only 30%, a prompt vasodilation is observed. Hypoxia will shift the C.O. curve\ndownward and to the right--with severe hypoxia seriously damaging the heart's ability to pump.\nFigure 64 illustrates the impact of two degrees of hypoxia on cardiac output.\n-4\nRight Atrial Pressure (mm.Hg)\nB\nA\nC\nD\nCardiac Output and Venous Return\n(liters/min.)\nMaximum sympathetic\nstimulation\nMaximum sympathetic\nstimulation\nSpinal anesthesia\nSpinal anesthesia\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Well-\ntrained athletes may increase their cardiac outputs by up to 6 or 7 times normal. Exercise can affect\ncardiac output in several ways:\n1.\nTensing of muscles, especially those in the abdomen and legs, can increase mean\nsystemic pressure, thus increasing venous return.\n2.\nAutonomic stimulation will increase mean systemic filling pressure and also\nincrease cardiac contractility and rate.\n3.\nIncrease in muscle metabolism causes local vasodilatation which decreases the\nresistance to venous return.

At the onset of moderate exercise, the tensing of muscles leads to an\nimmediate increase in MSP from 7mmHg to 10 mmHg, and the operating point moves to B. Note\nthat the resistance to venous return on this venous return curve has increased slightly due to\nmuscle clamping. The CO increases from 5 L/min to about 6 L/min. During the next 15 to 20\nseconds sympathetic stimulation becomes significant, causing both cardiac and peripheral effects.\nBoth CO and venous return curves shift appropriately, and the next operating point is at C with a\ncardiac output of 8 L/min at an RA pressure of 0. Finally, metabolic dilatation of the muscular\nvascular bed occurs, resulting in decreased resistance to venous return. The new equilibrium point\nat D shows a CO of 13 L/min at an RA pressure close to zero.\nOnset of\nstrenous exercise\n64 128 256\nSeconds After Onset of Exercise\nMean Systemic Pressure (mm.Hg)\nCardiac Output (liters per minute)\nHeart Rate (per minute)\nResistance to Venous Return\n(dyne seconds/cm5 )\nResistance to\nvenous return\nCardiac\noutput\nHeart\nrate\nMean circulatory\npressure\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Introduction\nThe electrocardiogram had been used as a diagnostic test in clinical medicine for more than\n70 years, and is now a routine part of any complete medical evaluation. Many cardiac abnormalities\nalter the heart's electrical activity, and cause changes in the ECG. Since the electrical activity of\nboth atria and ventricles is reflected in the ECG, the test is of particular value in defining cardiac\nrhythm. Diseases which result in changes in the myocardial muscle mass will alter the ECG. For\nexample, an increase in ventricular muscle mass (hypertrophy) usually results in larger QRS\namplitudes. Diseases which cause death of heart muscle and replacement by scar tissue (such as\nmyocardial infarctions) will be reflected in characteristic changes in morphology of the QRS\ncomplex. Inadequate blood supply to heart muscle resulting from coronary artery disease may\ncause alterations in the repolarization of muscle cells, which will be reflected in characteristic\nchanges in the ST-T wave portion of the electrocardiogram.\nOn the other hand, the ECG is insensitive to some cardiac abnormalities, and many ECG\nchanges are non-specific. Small, localized regions of heart muscle damage may exist but not be\nvisible in the routine clinical ECG. The ECG may be completely normal in patients with severe\ncoronary artery disease, as long as adequate myocardial blood flow is present at the time of the\nrecording. Increased sensitivity may be obtained by recording the detailed distribution of potentials\non the surface of the torso using large numbers (up to hundreds) of electrodes. Such \"body\nsurface mapping\" requires extensive instrumentation and computation making it impractical for\nroutine clinical use at the present time. Transient abnormalities such as coronary artery spasm, or\nsporadic rhythm disturbances may be completely missed in a routine ECG recording which\ndocuments less than one minute of data.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nThe usefulness of the ECG has been extended by technology for recording 24 hours of\nECG data while the patient engages in his usual daily activities. Such ambulatory ECG (\"Holter\")\nrecordings are particularly useful in documenting sporadic events. The combination of ECG\nrecordings and graded physical exercise (\"stress testing\") increases the sensitivity of the ECG in\ndetecting underlying coronary artery disease. This chapter will discuss only clinical scalar\nelectrocardiography, and will focus on the general principles relating features of the ECG to\nunderlying physiologic phenomena. We will cover arrhythmias in moderate detail, and will provide\nillustrative examples of the ECG correlates of myocardial hypertrophy, ischemia, and infarction.\n2. The Normal Electrocardiogram\nA typical clinical 12-lead scalar ECG from a normal subject is shown in Figure 1A. It\nconsists of a short sample of ECG (usually one to three beats) from each of the six frontal plane\nleads and the six precordial leads.\nFigure 1B illustrates a normal vectorcardiogram showing the locus of the tip of the heart\nvector during depolarization of atria (P-loop) and ventricles (QRS loop), and the repolarization of\nthe ventricles (T-loop).\nFigure 2 shows one cycle of a typical electrocardiogram in detail, together with a rhythm\nstrip: a longer strip (usually Lead II in order to show clear P-waves) is added to provide information\nabout cardiac rhythm. The conventions regarding the voltage and time calibrations are indicated on\nthe figure. Electrocardiographic equipment is usually calibrated so that the vertical distance between\ntwo adjacent lines represents 0.1 millivolt and the horizontal distance between two adjacent lines\nrepresents 0.04 seconds. The lines on standard graph paper are one millimeter apart. For example, a\none millivolt waveform lasting 0.2 seconds will stand 10 millimeters tall and 5 millimeters wide.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 1 - Normal Electrocardiogram and Vectorcardiogram\nA.\nA normal 12-lead scalar electrocardiogram\nB.\nA normal vectorcardiogram in the frontal plane, showing also the standard scalar lead vectors.\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Yonkman.\nVol. 5 of The Ciba Collection of Medical Illustrations. Summit, N.J.: Ciba Pharmaceutical Company, 1969.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFrom left to right the first deflection seen in Figure 2 is labeled a P-wave. It represents the\nvoltage change at the body's surface caused by the depolarization of the atria. Atrial depolarization\nis usually complete in about 0.1 seconds. Therefore, the P-wave usually spans about 2.5\nmillimeters. A P-wave typically stands 1-2 millimeters tall (0.1-0.2 millivolts).\nThe P-wave on the vectorcardiogram is represented by a low-amplitude loop (Fig. 1). The\nmean axis of the P-wave is +60 in the frontal plane and +30 in the horizontal plane. Thus, its\nelectrical axis roughly parallels the mean direction of spread of depolarization from the SA node to\nthe AV junction. P-wave amplitude, therefore, will be maximum in Leads II, and aVF.\nOnce the P-wave is completed, an isoelectric segment follows during which no surface\npotential is visible using ordinary equipment. During this time the cardiac action potential passes\nthrough the AV node and ventricular conduction system. The interval from the beginning of the P-\nwave to the beginning of the QRS complex is called the PR interval and is normally no longer than\n0.2 seconds in adults. Action potentials in the conduction system may be documented only by\nusing catheter electrodes placed within the heart in close proximity to the common bundle of His\n(see Figure 3).\nA wave corresponding to atrial repolarization occurs, but is ordinarily buried in the QRS\ncomplex, and is not identifiable in the ECG.\nThe QRS wave complex follows the PR segment. It represents ventricular depolarization,\nlasts approximately 80-100 milliseconds, and has an amplitude of 0.5-1.0 millivolts. The QRS\nvector initially points to the right and anteriorly as septal depolarization is initiated. Then the vector\nsweeps leftward and posteriorly as the remainder of the ventricular myocardium is depolarized. (See\nFigure 21 of previous chapter.) The QRS depolarization is much greater in amplitude than the P-\nwave complex because of the greater muscular mass of the ventricle, and the greater synchronization\nof depolarization by the high speed ventricular conduction system. The most common mean QRS\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\naxis is between +30 and +90 degrees in the frontal plane and 0 to -30 degrees in the horizontal\nplane.

Saunders Company, 1980.\nAt the completion of the QRS complex, another segment of zero voltage normally follows:\nthe ST segment. It corresponds to the plateau period of the action potential during which the\nventricles remain depolarized. It typically lasts 150 milliseconds, but is a function of heart rate. (See\nFigure 2.)\nThe T-wave follows the ST-segment, and corresponds to ventricular repolarization. Cellular\nrepolarization is a much slower process than depolarization. Also, repolarization does not appear to\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\npropagate from cell to cell. Rather, individual cells repolarize independently depending on their\nindividual plateau duration. Whereas depolarization spreads from endocardium to epicardium,\nrepolarization normally proceeds in the opposite direction (the action potentials of epicardial cells\nare shorter than those of endocardial cells). Because of the reversed directions of propagation of\nrepolarization and depolarization, the mean axis of the T-wave loop is roughly parallel to the QRS\naxis. (See Figure 1.) Thus, in scalar leads showing a primarily positive QRS deflection, the T-wave\nshould also be upright, and vice versa. The T-wave is of smaller amplitude and longer duration than\nthe QRS complex. Normal T-wave duration is 0.15-0.20 seconds, and normal amplitude in the limb\nleads is less than 0.6 millivolts. The normal angle between the mean QRS vector and the mean T-\nwave vector is less than 40 .\nThe QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T-\nwave. The QT interval is used as a measure of the duration of the action potential of ventricular\nmuscle cells, and is a function of the heart rate. (See Figure 2.)\n3. Pathophysiology of Arrhythmias\n3.1 Introduction\nThe rhythm of the heart is determined by the generation of an impulse by some pacemaker\ncell, and the conduction of that impulse to the rest of the heart. Disturbances in cardiac rhythm are\na result of abnormalities in impulse initiation, or conduction, or both. There are a number of\nmechanisms that can cause these abnormalities, and in this section we will review many of them.\n3.2 Arrhythmias Caused by Abnormal Impulse Generation\n3.2.1 Normal Automaticity\nThe property of autorhythmicity is shared by cells in the SA node, some parts of the atria,\nthe AV junction, and the ventricular conduction system. In the normal heart, there is a gradient of\nautomaticity as one moves from the SA node down to the Purkinje system. The rate of impulse\ngeneration is normally highest at the SA node (70 to 80 per minute), lower in the AV junction (50 to\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\n60 per minute), and lowest (30 to 40 per minute) in the ventricular conduction system. In the normal\nheart, the rate of impulse formation in the sinus node is sufficiently rapid that potentially automatic\ncells (latent pacemakers) in other regions of the heart are reset before they reach threshold. Thus,\nheart rate is established by the fastest pacemaker site.\nA number of factors can affect automaticity. The autonomic nervous system has a major\ninfluence on the cells of the SA node and AV junction. Vagal stimulation slows the rate of firing,\nand sympathetic stimulation increases the rate. Increased temperature causes increased rate of firing\nand vice versa (Fig. 4). Hypoxia and hypercapnia cause an increase in the slope of the phase 4\ndepolarization, and increase the firing rate of pacemaker cells. Cardiac dilation increases the rate of\nfiring. Automaticity of cells is affected by electrolyte imbalance and myocardial injury, and these\nmechanisms will be discussed in the next section.\nFigure 4 - The Effect of Temperature on Firing Rate of Automatic Cells.\nThe figure shows pacemaker potentials from sheep Purkinje fibers at different bath temperatures.

The Initiation of the Heartbeat, 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979.\nIf for some reason, a higher pacemaker center fails to generate an impulse, or if the impulse\nis not properly conducted, a pacemaker lower in the cardiac conduction system will have time to\ndepolarize to its threshold potential and generate an impulse. Such a beat is called an escape beat. A\nsustained sequence of such beats is called an escape rhythm. On the other hand, if a lower\npacemaker site prematurely discharges because of local increased automaticity, the resultant beat is\ncalled an ectopic beat. A series of such beats would thus be an ectopic rhythm.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\n3.2.2 Abnormal Automaticity\nUnder normal conditions, atrial and ventricular myocardiac cells do not exhibit spontaneous\ndiastolic depolarization. Under abnormal conditions, however, automaticity may be observed in\nthese cells. If such cells are experimentally depolarized to a membrane potential more positive than\nabout -60 millivolts, spontaneous automaticity may occur and cause repetitive impulse generation.\nThis phenomenon is called abnormal automaticity. It has also been observed in purkinje cells.\nConditions which might lead to such abnormal partial depolarization of cardiac cells might be found\nin myocardial injury. Severely injured cells (as in myocardial ischemia and/or infarction) would be\nexpected to release large amounts of potassium into the immediate extracellular vicinity of nearby\nviable cells. This is particularly the case with subendocardial Purkinje fibers which may remain\nviable even in a zone of infarcted tissue because of oxygen diffusing directly from the intracavitary\nblood pool. The action potentials generated by such partially depolarized cells often show the slow\nupstrokes characteristic of the slow inward current (Figure 5a).\nMyocardial fibers with low resting potentials will not fire spontaneously if the sinus node\ndrives them faster than their intrinsic rate. The abnormal focus may manifest itself, however, when\nthe sinus rate decreases.\nIt is possible for these abnormal pacemaker sites to be functionally isolated form the rest of\nthe heart by surrounding tissue which is electrically unexcitable. Action potentials from the normal\nmyocardium are prevented from reaching the independent pacer site (\"entrance block\"), and\nsimilarly, impulses generated by the ectopic focus are unable to propagate into the rest of the heart\n(\"exit block\"). Figure 5b demonstrates this phenomenon in an experimental situation. It is also\npossible to have an abnormal pacer site which can propagate its impulses into the rest of the heart,\nbut which is not reset from the outside because of entrance block. Such a pacemaker site is called a\n\"parasystolic\" pacemaker.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 5 - Abnormal Automaticity, Entrance Block and Exit Block in Purkinje Fibers that\nSurvived Myocardial Infarction.\n200 msec\n100 mV\nA\n200 msec\n100 mV\nB\nFigure by MIT OCW. After p. 59 Josephson, Mark E. Ventricular Tachycardia: Mechanisms and Management.\nMount Kisco, N.Y.: Futura Publishing Company, 1975.\nAnother important mechanism which may lead to abnormal automaticity is the phenomenon\nknow as triggered activity. Triggered activity is impulse generation caused by after-depolarization.\nAn after-depolarization is a second subthreshold depolarization that occurs either during the\nrepolarization phase (early after-depolarization), or after repolarization is complete or nearly\ncomplete (delayed after-depolarization).\nEarly after-depolarizations usually occur during the repolarization phase of an action\npotential that has been initiated from a high level of membrane potential (usually between -75 and\nClinical Electrocardiography\nIntracellular recordings of infracted and non-infarcted ventricular tissue from an isolated dog heart after\nanterior descending coronary artery ligation.

Under some conditions, early after-depolarizations\ncan lead to second upstrokes which may reach the threshold potential for activating the slow inward\ncurrent. This results in a second action potential which occurs prior to the complete repolarization\nof the first. This second action potential may also be followed by a train of additional action\npotentials all occurring at the low level of membrane potential characteristic of the plateau or Phase\n3 (Figures 6b, 6c).\nFigure 6 - Early Afterdepolarizations\nA\nB\nmV\nmV\n+30\n-60\n-90\n+30\n-60\n-90\nEarly\nafterdepolarization\nRhythmic activity with maximum diastolic\npotential near the low stable resting potential\nTermination by repolarization\nto the high stable resting\npotential\nFigure by MIT OCW.

The amount of automatic activity increases as membrane potential is\nreduced. (After Wit A L, Friedman P F. Bases for ventricular arrhythmias accompanying myocardial\ninfarction. Arch. Intern. Med. 1975; 135: 459.)\n\nEarly after-depolarizations which lead to triggered activity in isolated cardiac preparations\nmay be caused by factors which are present in vivo under some pathologic conditions. These\nfactors include hypoxia, high pCO2, and high concentrations of catecholamines. Since these\nconditions may be present in an ischemic or infarcted region of the ventricles, it is conceivable that\nearly after-depolarizations may cause some of the arrhythmias that occur soon after myocardial\nischemia. It also has been suggested that mechanical injury may predispose to early after-\ndepolarization. Mechanical injury might occur clinically in the area of an infarct or aneurysm.\nDelayed after-depolarizations are transient or oscillatory depolarizations which occur\nimmediately after the terminal repolarization of an action potential. Delayed after-depolarizations are\nillustrated in Figure 7. This phenomenon is observed under a number of conditions in which there\nis a significant increase in the intracellular calcium. One of the most widely recognized causes is\ndigitalis toxicity. Cardiac glycosides inhibit the sodium-potassium pump, thus leading to an\nincrease in intracellular sodium. The intracellular sodium is then probably extruded from the cell in\nexchange for calcium by a sodium/calcium exchange mechanism. Catecholamines can cause\ndelayed after-depolarizations. In addition, they have sometimes been observed in the presence of\nlow membrane potentials.\nDelayed after-depolarizations may not reach threshold, in which case triggered activity does\nnot occur. The amplitude of the delayed after-depolarization tends to increase as the rate of firing of\nthe cell is increased, or as the coupling interval of a premature stimulation is decreased. (See Figure\n8.) Once the delayed after-depolarization reaches threshold, a prolonged train of triggered impulses\nmay result. Triggered activity can be terminated by either premature or overdrive electrical\nstimulation.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 7 - Delayed Afterdepolarizations\n4OOO\n50 mV\nA\n750 msec\n2OOO\n15OO\n50 mV\nB\n7500 ms\nFigure by MIT OCW.

After p. 1464 in Fozzard...\n3.3 Abnormal Impulse Conduction\n3.3.1 Decremental Conduction and Block\nA number of arrhythmias are caused by failure of the cardiac impulse to propagate properly\nthroughout the heart. Some disease processes, such as infarction and fibrosis, may permanently\ninterrupt portions of the cardiac conduction system. The result may be a fixed barrier to conduction\nin one of the major bundle branches (bundle branch block), or even complete electrical separation of\nthe atria and ventricles (complete heart block).\nMore commonly, functional changes in the electrophysiological properties of the\nconduction system modify impulse conduction. Slowing of conduction may occur in any part of the\nconduction system, and is referred to as \"decremental conduction\". (See Figure 9.) It results from\npartial inactivation of the fast sodium channels. If this current is sufficiently inactivated, cells my be\nleft with only calcium channels to support the action potential which then propagates quite slowly.\nClinical Electrocardiography\nEffect of premature stimulation on afterdepolarization amplitude and triggering. Premature impulses\n(arrows) were generated after a series of 10 impulses driven at 4000ms. Coupling intervals between pulse\ntrain and premature premature impulse generation was progressively decreased from trace A to trace C\nresulting in increases in impulse magnitude and induction of triggered activity in trace C.\n\nDecremental conduction may occasionally lead to complete failure of conduction. Sometimes the\nblock is one-way, preventing conduction in one direction, but not the other.\nFigure 9 - Decremental Conduction\nDirection of impulse\npropagation\naction\nthreshold\npotential\nArea of decremental\nconduction\nFigure by MIT OCW. After fig. 21.4, p. 523 in Katz, Arnold M. Physiology of the Heart. 2nd ed. New York: Raven Press, 1992.\nThe velocity of conduction of a cardiac action potential is determined by several factors\nincluding:\n1)\nthe amplitude and rate of rise of the phase 0 depolarizing current;\n2)\nThe radius of the conducting fiber; and\n3)\nthe internal resistance, ri, of the myocardial bundle.\nDecreasing the amplitude or the rise-time of the action potential slows conduction velocity.\nSuch changes may result from partial depolarization of the cell as may occur in areas of myocardial\ninjury where the extracellular potassium concentration rises. Certain drugs, particularly some anti\narrhythmics, slow the rate of rise of the action potential by partially inhibiting the fast inward\nsodium current.\nThe velocity of propagation is proportional to the square root of the fiber radius. The very\nslow conduction velocity in the AV node may thus be explained on the basis of both the slow rise-\nClinical Electrocardiography\nEffect of decremental conduction on action potential shape. When impulses being transmitted through\ncardiac muscle reach an area of decremental conduction (shaded), the action potential magnitude is\ndecreased and the upstroke is slowed. If the impulse is transmitted, the normal action potential is\nregenerated, but arrives delayed. (After A. Katz, Physiology of the Heart, Raven Press.)\n\ntime of the action potential and also the small cell size. Furthermore, in regions of the SA node and\nAV node the density of tight junctions (nexi) is reduced, with the effect of increasing the\nlongitudinal intracellular resistance, ri. This change also tends to slow impulse conduction.\nA decrease in conduction velocity with eventual block may occur when an impulse arrives at\ncells that have not completely recovered excitability from a previously conducted action potential.\nAn action potential triggered during the relative refractory phase, for example, will have a lower\namplitude and slower rise time than normal. This results in slow propagation and possible block.\n(For example, if atrial premature beats occur early enough, they may be blocked at the level of the\nAV node and never depolarize the ventricle.) Since the refractory period of the right bundle branch\nis typically longer than that of the left bundle, some atrial premature beats which are successfully\npropagated across the AV node may be blocked in the right bundle branch resulting in a QRS\ncomplex which is abnormally shaped. This phenomenon is called \"aberrant conduction.\" Although\nmost common in the right bundle, it may also occur in the left bundle branch.\n3.3.2 Reentry\nIn the presence of slow conduction and/or unidirectional block, it is possible to establish in\nthe myocardium a so-called \"reentrant loop\" of excitation. There are many possible geometric\narrangements for such loops, which may exist in many locations of the heart. In all configurations,\nhowever, it is required that an action potential pathway exist such that the wave-front of activation\nreturns to previously excited tissue after a delay long enough to permit that tissue to have recovered\nits excitability. Some workers have subdivided the reentrant mechanism into two categories,\n\"random reentry\" and \"ordered reentry.\" Random reentry is most associated with atrial or\nventricular fibrillation, whereas ordered reentry can cause most other types of arrhythmias. The\nmain distinction between the two is that during random reentry, propagation occurs over reentrant\npathways that continuously change their size and location with time. Ordered reentry, on the other\nhand, implies a relatively fixed reentrant pathway. Despite the differences, similar prerequisite\nelectrophysiologic conditions are required for either kind of reentrant excitation. The wave-length of\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nthe impulse in the reentrant circuit (conduction velocity × refractory period) must be shorter than\nthe length of the circuit, so that the tissue into which the impulse is reentering has had time to\nrecover excitability. Because of this requirement, it is clear that the relationship among path length,\nconduction velocity, and refractory period is crucial. Reentry can be promoted by slowing\nconduction velocity, by shortening the refractory period, or by a combination of both.\nReentry may occur in a variety of geometric configurations such as loops of Purkinje fiber\nbundles in a distal conduction system, bundles of surviving muscle fibers in healed myocardial\ninfarcts, or in fibrotic regions of the atria or ventricles (Figure 10).\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 10 - Re-entry\nMB\nII\nI\nA\nB\nVM\nII\nI\nII\nI\na\nb\nc\nc\nMB\nI\nI\nI\nII\nII\nb\nA\na\nB\nI\nII\nI\nII\nI\nII\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Ventricular Tachycardia: Mechanisms and Management.\nMount Kisco, N.Y.: Futura Publishing Company, 1975.\nReentry may be supported in the AV node, if it is functionally dissociated into two parallel\nconduction bundles with different properties (Fig. 11a, b). The action potential may propagate down\none parallel pathway while being unidirectionally blocked in the other. If the propagation times are\nslow enough, a reflected wave of depolarization may traverse back up the previously blocked\nClinical Electrocardiography\nPossible mechanisms for peripheral purkinje system reentry. The left panel shows a main bundle of\nPurkinje fibers (MB) dividing into two branches (A and B), before terminating on ventricular muscle\n(VM). Unidirectional antegrade conduction block (hatched) occurs in a severely depressed area of branch\nB. Action potentials from each region are shown below. Action potential I in the main bundle trace (MB)\ncorresponds to the antegrade impulse conducted from the main bundle (arrow I in the diagram) to both\nbranches, A and B. Conduction is blocked in B at the solid black line, but continues through A (see action\npotential in trace A) into the ventricular muscle. The impulse also continues into B in a retrograde\ndirection where it conducts back through the area of unidirectional block in B (see action potential in trace\nB) and reenters the main bundle (arrow II in the diagram and action potential II in trace MB). The bottom\nof the panel shows how such events might appear on the ECG. QRS I corresponds to antegrade\npropagation of impulse I into VM and QRS II corresponds to the reentrant premature depolarization after\nretrograde propagation of the reentrant impulse II. The right panel shows two parallel fibers in an\nunbranched bundle of Purkinje fibers. The entire shaded area is depressed with the more severe\nunidirectional conduction block indicated by the darker area. Action potentials can only propagate from\nleft to right in the bottom fiber. The impulse traverses the top fiber in the reverse direction, re-entering the\nbottom fiber again to cause a second depolarization.\n\nfascicle to institute a reentrant beat. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for many\nsupraventricular arrhythmias.\nFigure 11 - Mechanism of AV Nodal Re-entry\nFrom\nMuscle\nnode\nHis bundle\nMuscle\nSlow\nconduction\nArtial\nAnatomic AV\nArtrial approaches\nto the AV node\nTo Ventricular\nFast\nFast pathway\nA.

After fig. 27-11, p. 886 in Hurst...\nPatients with so-called \"pre-excitation syndrome\" (or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)\nhave abnormal accessory pathways of conduction which connect the atria and ventricles in parallel\nwith the AV node (Fig. 12a). Such patients are likely to develop reentrant loops composed of the\nClinical Electrocardiography\nMechanism of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia due to AV nodal reentry. PSVT due to AV nodal\nreentry results from dual AV nodal pathways having different conduction properties and refractory periods.\nA: During normal sinus rhythm in the presence of dual AV nodal pathway, the fast pathway (generally\nhaving a longer refractory period) is primarily responsible for AV transmission.\nB: A premature atrial impulse is blocked by the the fast pathway due to its longer refractory period, and\ntherefore propagates down the slow pathway. As a result, the PR interval is prolonged and retrograde\ninvasion of the fast pathway can occur.\nC: Echo beats or AV nodal reentrant tachycardia occur when the temporal relationship between slow\npathway conduction and recovery of fast pathway excitability allow the impulse to reenter the slow\npathway after retrograde fast pathway transmission. The atria can also be activated by retrograde\nconduction. In a much less common form of AV nodal reentry, a shorter refractory period in the fast\npathway reverses the loop, with antegrade conduction through the fast pathway and retrograde conduction\nup the slow pathway.

(This mechanism is felt to be the cause of the high\nincidence of supraventricular arrhythmias in these patients.)

Alternatively, the impulse may travel rapidly form atrium to ventricle via\nthe accessory connection, and then travel retrogradely back to the atrium via the AV node\n(antidromic conduction).\nFigure 12 - Bypass Tracts and Re-entry\nA.

Its\nanatomic and biophysical properties vary according to the direction of measurement. For example,\nconduction velocities in a direction parallel to the myocardial fiber orientation are more rapid than in\na direction perpendicular to the long axis. Additional anisotropic behavior is introduced in the\npresence of diffuse fibrosis, or regional ischemia. It has been demonstrated that such anisotropic\nproperties can lead to reentrant loops (Fig. 13). It is this type of milieu which could lead to the\ndevelopment of the chaotic electrical activity of ventricular fibrillation.\nFigure 13 - Epicardial activation maps 3.5 min after coronary artery occlusion in the porcine\nheart\nClinical Electrocardiography\nB\n2 cm\nIschemic zone\nRight ventricle\nB\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nUnipolar electrograms recorded from the ischemic and non-ischemic zones of the right ventricle are shown\n(top).

In analyzing the\nclinical electrocardiogram for rhythm, it is important to use a systematic approach.\nFirst, identify the QRS complexes. The following observations should be made:\n1)\nWhat is the ventricular rate?\n2)\nAre the QRS complexes spaced at regular intervals? If not, what is the nature of the\nirregularity?\n3)\nAre the QRS complexes identical in shape in a given lead? Are they of normal size\nand morphology?\nNext, identify the P-waves. In some cases this will require careful observation, and more\nthan one lead axis may be necessary. The following questions should be explored:\n1)\nIs there a one-to-one relationship between P-waves and QRS complexes? If not, is\nthere a definable pattern?\n2)\nIs the PR interval of normal duration?\n3)\nWhat is the atrial rate?\n4)\nAre the P-waves identical in shape in a given lead? Are they of normal size and\nshape?\nBased on the above analysis, it should be possible to identify the mechanism of the rhythm\nin most cases. The so-called \"ladder diagram\" is a very useful method for representing the detailed\nrhythm, including the site of impulse origin and its propagation pathway through the heart. Figure\n14 illustrates the technique. The vertical axis of the diagram is divided into four separate regions\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\ncorresponding to different sections of the cardiac conduction system. The top space represents the\nregion of the SA node, the second space is the atria, the third space is the AV junction and\nventricular conduction system, and fourth space represents the ventricles. The horizontal axis\nrepresents time. Electrical activation of the heart is represented by tracing the propagation pathway\nvertically as shown in the figure. Arrows indicate direction of propagation, and a dot indicates the\npoint of origin of the depolarization.\nFigure 14 - Ladder Diagram\nThe figure illustrates several electrophysiologic phenomena. The first two beats are normal\nsinus beats. Electrical activity begins in the SA node, and progagates slowly until it exits into the\natrial tissue. Atrial depolarization is represented as an instantaneous process (vertical line) to reflect\nthe notion that it is essentially an \"all-or-none\" phenomenon. The impulse travels slowly through\nthe AV junction (sloped line) and depolarizes the ventricles (again represented by a vertical line).\nThe third beat in the figure is abnormal. The electrical activity originates in two sites. The ventricular\ndepolarization originates from a site in the ventricles and spreads throughout these structures and in\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\na retrograde direction through the AV junction. In the meantime, the SA node fired, the impulse\ndepolarized the atria, and also invaded the AV junction. The two impulses collide in the AV junction\nand \"destructively interfere\" since each meets refractory tissue in its path. The fourth beat is a\nnormal one. The fifth beat represents electrical activity originating from somewhere in the atria and\nspreading to both the SA node (where it resets the pacemaker) and to the AV junction, where it fails\nto propagate (perhaps because the tissue was still refractory from a previous beat, or because of\ndisease). This phenomenon is termed \"AV block\".\nBy extension of these principles virtually any arrhythmia may be represented on the ladder\ndiagrams.\n4.2 Arrhythmias Due to Disturbances of Impulse Formation\n4.2.1 Normal Sinus Rhythm and Variants\nNormal sinus rhythm is characterized by a regular cardiac rate with normal QRS complexes\nwhose duration must be less than 100 milliseconds (Fig. 15). The P-waves are normal in shape, and\nare synchronized with the QRS complexes. The PR interval must be less than 0.2 seconds. Heart\nrates may range from 60-100 bpm.\nThere are a number of variant types of sinus rhythm. \"Sinus tachycardia\" (Fig. 16) refers\nto rates above 100 bpm. \"Sinus bradycardia\" means heart rates less than 60 (Fig. 17). \"Sinus\narrhythmia\" (Fig. 18) is a normal rhythm in which heart rate varies periodically, usually with the\nrespiratory cycle. There is an acceleration of rate during inspiration, and a slowing of rate during\nexpiration. A \"sinus pause\" refers to a P-P interval which is clearly longer than the usual, but less\nthan 3 seconds. A sinus pause extending beyond three seconds is generally referred to as \"sinus\narrest\".\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 15 - Normal Sinus Rhythm--Rate 85\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 16 - Sinus Tachycardia--Rate 122\nFigure 17 - Sinus Bradycardia--Rate 48\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 18 - Sinus Arrhythmia\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nV1\n\n4.2.2 Escape Beats and Rhythms\nEscape beats arise from lower (normally latent) pacemakers outside of the sinus node that\nfire because of either depressed sinus node function or blocked conduction of sinus impulses.\nEscape beats may originate at any pacemaker site below the sinus node.\nAtrial Escape Beats\nIf the SA node slows sufficiently (perhaps due to vagal tone), other latent pacemaker sites in\nthe atrium may emerge to establish heart rate. The P-wave resulting from these beats is usually\ndifferent in shape from the normal, and in many cases is inverted in polarity. This reflects the fact\nthat the beats originate low in the atrium. Such beats are sometimes referred to as \"low atrial\" or\n\"coronary sinus\" beats (or rhythms if sustained). (See Figs. 19, 20.)\nFigure 19 - Atrial Escape Beat\nClinical Electrocardiography\nCarotid Pressure\nSinus Pause\nAtrial Escape Beat\n\nFigure 20 - Atrial Escape Rhythm Emerges as Sinus Rate Slows\nAV Nodal Escape Beats\nAV-nodal escape beats often terminate prolonged sinus pauses. The QRS complex is\nnormal because the impulse is conducted normally to the ventricles (Fig. 21). The P-wave is either\nnot visible at all, or may be found just prior to or immediately following the QRS. In general the P-\nwave is abnormal in shape since it is retrogradely conducted. If the P-wave immediately precedes\nthe QRS complex, the beat is referred to as a \"high nodal beat\". Conversely, if the P-wave follows\nthe QRS, the beat is called a \"low nodal beat\". A sequence of nodal beats makes up a nodal\nrhythm (Figs. 22, 23). The rhythm is be called an escape rhythm if its rate is clearly less than that\nof the usual sinus rate.\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 21 - Nodal Escape Beats.\nThe last two beats are nodal escape beats which appear as sinus pacemaker slows.\nFigure 22 - Nodal Rhythm in Complete AV Block\nClinical Electrocardiography\nRate\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 23 - Low Nodal Rhythm ,\n,\n.\nVentricular Escape Beats\nVentricular escape beats protect the heart against asystole in the event of AV block (either\nfixed or transitory). They are characterized by a wide and usually bizarre QRS complex. The\ncardiac impulse originates in the ventricular Purkinje system. It is generally conducted with a slow\npropagation speed (0.5 meter/second) through the myocardium, thus leading to a wide QRS\ncomplex (usually greater than 120 msec) (Fig. 24). Ventricular escape rhythms (idioventricular\nrhythms) are common in cases of complete heart block, and have rates of about 40 per minute. (See\nFig. 51 below.)\n4.2.3 Ectopic Beats and Rhythms\nEctopic beats arise from pacemakers outside the sinus node as a result of an abnormal\nincrease in rhythmicity.\nAtrial Premature Beats (APBs)\nAPBs are seen frequently in normal individuals and have little clinical significance. They are\nalso seen in heart disease, and when frequent, may be an early sign of atrial irritability which may\nprogress to more serious atrial dysrhythmias. In APBs the QRS complexes are normal since they\nClinical Electrocardiography\np'\np'\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\npropagate normally through the ventricles via the conduction system (Fig. 25). The P-waves are\ngenerally slightly abnormal since they originate from an abnormal focus, and propagate in an\nabnormal pattern. The impulse generally invades the area of the SA node and resets the sinus\npacemaker.\nAPBs occurring quite early following the previous beat may be aberrantly conducted,\nfrequently with a right bundle branch block configuration. Aberrant conduction is particularly likely\nwhen the APB follows a long RR interval (the Ashman phenomenon) (Fig. 26). If an APB is\nextremely early it may run into refractory tissue in the AV node and be non-conducted (Fig. 27).\nParoxysmal Atrial Tachycardia (PAT)\nThis is an absolutely regular supraventricular tachycardia with heart rates which range\nbetween 120 and 220 bpm (fig. 28). The QRS complexes are normal, although on some occasions\naberrant conduction simulates ventricular tachycardia. (The differential diagnosis of\nsupraventricular tachycardia with wide QRS complexes from ventricular tachycardia may be\nextremely difficult.) P-waves may be slightly abnormal, since they are arising from an ectopic\nfocus. The PR interval may be normal or prolonged. If the atrial rate is quite high, it is likely that\nsome atrial beats will be non-conducted, resulting in 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 AV block. The mechanism of\nPAT and other supraventricular tachy-arrhythmias is probably a reentrant loop involving the AV\njunction\nPAT may often be seen in otherwise normal individuals. It also occurs in patients with heart\ndisease, including coronary artery disease, valvular disease and thyrotoxicosis. The attacks come\nsuddenly, may last for seconds, minutes, hours or even days. If the heart rate is high enough,\ncongestive heart failure may ensue, particularly if there is concomitant structural heart disease. The\ntreatment is to slow conduction through the AV node. This may be accomplished by increasing\nvagal tone by means of carotid sinus pressure, or by using drugs such as digitalis or calcium\nchannel blocking agents such as diltiazens or verapamil.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 24 - Ventricular Escape Beat\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 25 - Atrial Premature Contractions\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 26 - Aberrantly Conducted APBs (Ashman Phenomenon)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 27 - Non-conducted (Blocked) APBs\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 28 - Atrial Tachycardia\nAV Junctional Premature Contractions\nNodal, or AV junctional premature contractions arise from an ectopic focus in the AV nodal\narea. The impulse is generally conducted in two directions simultaneously. Retrograde conduction\nactivates the atria (with abnormal P-waves) and antegrade conduction activates the ventricles (normal\nQRS). The P-wave may precede (high nodal)(Fig. 29) or follow (low nodal) the QRS (Fig. 23).\nFrequently, no P-wave is seen, either because retrograde conduction is blocked or because the P-\nwave falls in the midst of the QRS complex (Fig. 30).\n\"AV junctional tachycardia\" is produced by sustained activity of the ectopic junctional\npacemaker. Since the intrinsic rate of nodal automaticity is 40-60 beats/minute, an \"accelerated\nClinical Electrocardiography\nNormal sinus\nrhythm\nAtrial tachycardia\nNormal sinus\nrhythm\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\njunctional rhythm\" is considered at rates above 60 (Fig. 31). AV junctional tachycardia usually\nrefers to rates above 100 (although there is no universal agreement on criteria).\nThe mechanism of junctional tachyarrhythmias may well be reentry in the AV node, a\npossible manifestation of functional longitudinal dissociation (recall Figure 11b).\nAV junctional tachycardia may occur as a paroxysmal arrhythmia in otherwise normal\nindividuals. Nodal tachycardia may also be a manifestation of digitalis toxicity, since that drug\nincreases automaticity in the AV junctional tissue.\nAt very rapid rates it is often impossible to differentiate sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia,\nand AV junctional tachycardia, since the P-waves and T-waves tend to blend together\nindistinguishable. When a definite diagnosis cannot be made from the surface ECG, the term\n\"supraventricular tachycardia\" is used (Figure 32).\nFigure 29 - High Junctional Premature Beat\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 30 - AV Junctional Premature Contraction (no P-wave)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nClinical Electrocardiography\nII\naVF\nN\nN\nN\n\nFigure 31 - Accelerated Junctional Rhythm\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 32 - Supraventricular Tachycardia\nAtrial Flutter\nIn atrial flutter, there is a regular, rapid atrial rhythm at a rate of 220-330 bpm. The most\ncommon atrial rate is about 300 bpm. There will always be some AV block, generally 2:1 but on\nsome occasions 4:1 or variable AV block may be seen (Figs. 33 and 34). Hence, the ventricular rate\nmay be regular or irregular. The QRS complex is usually normal. In leads II and AVF one\nfrequently sees the characteristic saw-tooth pattern of the atrial depolarizations. The mechanism of\nthis arrhythmia is likely a reentrant mechanism in the atrium.\nThis arrhythmia is usually associated with underlying heart disease such as coronary artery\ndisease, rheumatic valve disease, cardiomyopathy, etc. It is a difficult rhythm to eradicate. It\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nsometimes responds to drugs such as quinidine, procainamide, verapamil, or amiodarone; but often\nelectrical cardioversion is required. Chronic recalcitrant, symptomatic atrial flutter may be managed\nwith RF catheter ablation with some success. The rhythm is usually tolerated well as long as the\nventricular response rate can be kept below about 100 bpm.\nAtrial Fibrillation\nIn this arrhythmia, the atrial activity is chaotic and very rapid. The AV node is bombarded\nwith a high frequency of atrial impulses. These impulses are transmitted through the node in a\nprobabilistic manner leading to \"irregularly irregular\" ventricular responses at rates which may\nvary widely. Ventricular response rates in untreated atrial fibrillation may range from as low as 50\nto as high as 200 bpm depending upon the state of function of the AV junction (Fig. 35). The QRS\ncomplexes are generally normal in morphology. However, aberrant conduction does occur,\nparticularly with very short R-R intervals. The P-waves are not present as discrete depolarizations.\nIn some cases, a small irregular oscillation of the baseline may be seen, but in other cases the\nbaseline appears flat.\nThis is a common arrhythmia clinically, and is usually associated with underlying heart\ndisease. Rapid ventricular response rates may lead to decreased cardiac output, angina, or congestive\nheart failure.\nTreatment is usually focused on increasing the degree of AV block to slow the ventricular\nresponse rate. Drugs such as digitalis or calcium-channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) will\naccomplish this objective. Conversion of the rhythm to normal sinus is desirable whenever possible,\nand may be attempted using either drugs or electric cardioversion. More agressive approaches\ninclude implantable atrial defibrillators, RF ablation procedures, or ablation of the AV junction with\npermanent cardiac pacing.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nClinical Electrocardiography\nVentricular Premature Beats (VPBs)\nThese ectopic beats originate from somewhere in the ventricles. The QRS complex is wide\n(greater than 0.12 seconds) and bizarre (Fig. 36). VPBs may exhibit fixed coupling to previous\nnormal beats. They may occur early or late in the cycle.\nThe mechanism for PVCs may be reentry or triggered activity as discussed previously.\nSome VPBs appear to show no fixed coupling to preceding normal beats. If they show a regular\nrhythm of their own, they may result from a parasystolic focus (Fig. 37). Note that some\nparasystolic depolarizations experience \"exit block\" and do not result in ventricular excitation.\nParasystolic ventricular ectopic beats are usually considered relatively benign.\nMost VPBs are followed by a pause. The pause is usually compensatory--meaning that the\ncoupling interval to the preceding normal beat plus the pause following the VPB comprise an\ninterval equal to twice the normal R-R interval (Fig. 38). An interpolated VPB is one which is\nsandwiched between two normal QRS complexes which arrive on time (Fig. 39).\nFigure 33 - Atrial Flutter (atrial rate--300)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 34 - Atrial Flutter (2:1 conduction, atrial rate--300)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 35 - Atrial Fibrillation (2 examples)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 36 - Ventricular Premature Contractions\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 37 - Apparent and Concealed VPBs in Parasystole\nFigure 38 - Compensatory Pause Following VPB\nVPBs are often found in otherwise normal individuals and probably have little significance\nif they are infrequent. In heart disease, VPBs may be a risk factor for increased incidence of more\nserious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. VPBs may occur singly or in groups and the\nfollowing ordering of increasing severity of ventricular ectopic activity has been proposed:\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n50 mm\n50 mm\nCompensatory\npause\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nOccasional:\nless than 30 per hour VPBs of the same\nmorphology (Fig. 36)\nFrequent:\ngreater than 30 per hour uniform VPBs or\nbigeminy where every other beat is a VPB (Fig. 40)\nMultiform PVCs:\ndifferent QRS morphologies (Fig. 41)\nCouplets:\npairs of consecutive VPBs (Fig. 42)\nVentricular Tachycardia:\nruns of three or more VPBs (Fig. 43)\nVentricular Flutter:\nrapid ventricular tachycardia with a sinusoidal\nconfiguration caused by merging of QRSs and Ts\n(Fig. 44)\nVentricular Fibrillation\nchaotic electrical activity without definite QRS\ncomplexes (Fig. 45)\nVPBs which occur very early in the cardiac cycle such that they fall on the T-wave of the\nprevious beat are considered particularly dangerous. At the time corresponding to the peak of the T-\nwave, the ventricular myocardium is just beginning to repolarize. Some cells may be in the relatively\nrefractory period, while others may be more fully recovered, and still others quite refractory. The\nelectrical properties of the myocardium are thus quite varied, and conditions favoring reentrant\nloops are likely. Thus, an extra stimulus in the form of an isolated VPB which is very early-cycle\nmay trigger a repetitive ventricular ectopic rhythm such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular\nfibrillation. (The period near the T-wave peak is often referred to as the \"vulnerable period\".)\nFigure 46 shows example of an early cycle \"R-on-T\" VPB initiating ventricular tachycardia.\nProper characterization of ventricular ectopic activity requires long-term (24-hour) ECG\nmonitoring. This is usually accomplished with small battery-operated tape recorders. The ECG is\nrecorded throughout the patient's normal daily activities. The tape is scanned at high speed after the\nrecording period, and summary reports are prepared. New technology has led to considerable\nautomation in the scanning process, and has even made possible real-time arrhythmia analysis using\nportable microprocessors.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nThe treatment for ventricular ectopic activity is generally restricted to patients who have\ndemonstrated structural heart disease, or patients who have major symptoms (episodes of light\nheadedness or syncope). Suppression of VPBs in individuals with otherwise normal hearts is\ngenerally not indicated because: (1) ventricular ectopic activity in such individuals is not associated\nwith increased risk of death, and (2) many anti-arrhythmic drugs have been shown to increase the\nrisk of death. Patients with high-grade and/or symptomatic VEA (ventricular ectopic activity) who\nhave known structural heart disease, may be candidates for therapy. Beta adrenergic blockers have a\nsubstantial benefit on mortality, and may suppress VEA in many patients. Patients who are at high\nrisk of sudden death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias are best treated with implantable\ndefibrillators.\nVentricular Fibrillation\nThis rhythm is manifested by a random oscillation of potential on the surface ECG, with no\nQRS complexes (Fig. 45). There is no coherent, synchronous electrical or mechanical activity.\nThere is no cardiac output, and this rhythm is fatal if untreated. Treatment is by electrical\ncountershock together with other resuscitative measures.\nFigure 39 - Interpolated VPB\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nClinical Electrocardiography\nPR interval\n.19\nInterpolated VPC\n\nFigure 40 - Bigemeny\nFigure 41 - Multiform VPBs\nFigure 42 - Ventricular Couplets\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 43 - Short Bursts of Ventricular Tachycardia\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 44 - Ventricular Flutter\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 45 - Three Examples of Ventricular Fibrillation\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 46 - R-on-T VPB Initiates Ventricular Flutter\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n4.3 Arrhythmias Due to Abnormal Conduction\n4.3.1 Atrio-Ventricular Conduction Defects\nA variety of important rhythm disturbances are related to decremental conduction and block\nin the AV junction.\nFirst Degree AV Block\nThis arrhythmia is simply a prolongation of propagation through the AV node. It is\nmanifested on the ECG as a PR-interval longer than 0.20 seconds (Figure 47). All atrial\ndepolarizations are conducted to the ventricles. The arrhythmia does not cause hemodynamic\nproblems of significance, although in some cases optimal AV phasing is lost. The rhythm may\nreflect underlying disease of the AV junction, or may be a result of drugs such as digoxin, beta-\nblockers, or calcium antagonists.\nFigure 47 - First Degree A-V Block\nSecond Degree AV Block\nIn this situation, some atrial impulses are not propagated to the ventricles. The block is\neither in the AV junction or in the ventricular conduction system. Second degree block may\nmanifest itself in many forms, some with more clinical significance than others.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nAn increase in vagal tone may result in prolongation of the PR-interval, and in some cases\nwill cause transient block in AV propagation. Transient second degree heart block may be seen in\nnormal individuals especially during sleep or in episodes of intense vagal activity such as vomiting.\nSignificant second degree AV block may also be a manifestation of chronic or acute heart disease\nsuch as fibrosis, ischemia, infarction, or inflammation. It may be transient (as with acute inferior\nmyocardial infarction) or permanent.\nSecond degree AV block has been subdivided into two types:\n- Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) (Fig. 48). In this form, the PR-interval grows\nprogressively longer until finally an atrial beat is non-conducted. This results in a typical\ngroup beating pattern, with a fixed or variable ratio of atrial to ventricular beats (4:3, 6:5,\netc.). The AV node conduction velocity seems to slow with successive beats until one\nimpulse fails to be conducted. After a period of rest, the AV node recovers and the cycle\nrepeats.\nFigure 48 - Second Degree A-V Block (Wenckebach or Mobitz Type I)\n- Mobitz type II (Fig. 49). In this type of second degree AV block the PR intervals do not\nchange, but remain constant. Occasional atrial beats are non-conducted or \"dropped\".\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure 49 - Second Degree A-V Block (Mobitz II)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nThe two forms of second degree AV block have important clinical distinctions. The form\nwith constant PR-intervals is usually associated with organic disease of the ventricular conduction\nsystem. Recordings from within the heart demonstrate a prolongation in the conduction time from\nthe bundle of His to the ventricle. The implication is that the major ventricular conduction pathways\nhave been significantly damaged. This exposes the patient to significant risk of complete heart\nblock.\nThe Wenckebach type second degree heart block is more often transient and is seen either\nin association with an acute process (such as myocardial infarction), or as a result of changing vagal\ntone. Wenckebach-type block is usually associated with the AV node itself, and is generally not\nconsidered a precursor of progressive AV node conduction failure.\nThird Degree (Complete) AV Block\nThird degree AV block implies complete block of all atrial impulses. There is no\ncommunication between the atria and the ventricles, and AV synchrony is lost. Since the ventricles\nreceive no supraventricular impulses, an escape rhythm usually ensues. If the conduction block is\nabove the AV node, then a junctional escape rhythm may develop (Fig. 50). If the AV node is\nseverely depressed, or the conduction system is interrupted below the AV node, then an\nidioventricular escape rhythm develops (Fig. 51). Patients with complete heart block who are\n\nuntreated tend to die suddenly as a result of either cardiac standstill or ventricular fibrillation. Even\nwith the use of oral sympathomimetic drugs, the annual mortality rate was approximately 50%. The\ntreatment of choice is a permanent cardiac pacemaker (Fig. 52). This technology has been\nextremely successful in treating complete heart block, essentially eliminating the increased risk of\ndying prematurely.\nFigure 50 - Complete A-V Block with Junctional Escape Rhythm\nFigure 51 - Complete Heart Block with Idioventricular Escape Rhythm\nFigure 52 - Pacemaker Rhythm\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nClinical Electrocardiography\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n4.3.2 Ventricular Conduction Defects\nThe ventricular conduction pathways are illustrated in Figure 53. After leaving the AV node,\nelectrical activity passes through the bundle of His. The conduction system then divides distally: the\nright ventricle is supplied by the right bundle branch, and the left ventricle is supplied by branches\nfrom the left bundle. There are several types of ventricular conduction defects. A bundle branch\nblock is an ECG abnormality resulting from failure to conduct in either the right bundle branch or\nthe main division of the left bundle branch. A hemi-block is an ECG pattern which is associated\nwith failure to conduct through one of the two fascicles of the left bundle branch.\nFigure 53\nDiagrammatic Illustration of the Intraventricular Conduction System\nBundle of His\nLeft Posterior Fascicle\nLeft Anterior Fascicle\nLeft Septal Fibers\nRight Bundle Branch\nPurkinje Fibers\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nRight Bundle Branch Block\nRight bundle branch block (RBBB) is fairly common and is not diagnostic of any heart\ndisease as such. (See Figure 54.) While it may be seen in a number of types of heart disease\n(coronary heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, congenital heart disease, right ventricular\nhypertrophy, etc.), it may also be found in normal individuals with no evidence of heart disease.\nFigure 55 illustrates the abnormal sequence of ventricular depolarization in RBBB. Note that septal\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\ndepolarization is normal since it originates from the intact left bundle branch. Left ventricular\ndepolarization spreads normally. Right ventricular depolarization is delayed because the conduction\nvelocity through muscle is much slower than that through the conduction system. Figure 56 shows\nthe typical pattern of RBBB. Note the wide QRS complexes, with the relatively normal initial waves,\nbut the abnormal late deflections reflecting the late right ventricular depolarization. This leads to a\nlate positive (R′) wave in the anterior precordial leads and a late negative S wave in the lateral\nprecordial leads and lead I.\nFigure 54 - Right Bundle Branch Block\nBlock in Right\nBundle Branch\nFigure by MIT OCW.

It is rarely seen in individuals\nwith healthy hearts. It may occur in association with a wide variety of clinical entities including\ncoronary artery disease, hypertensive heart disease, aortic valvular disease, and others. The sequence\nof ventricular depolarization begins at the apex of the right ventricle and spreads across the septum\nfrom right to left (opposite from normal) and later across the entire left ventricle (Fig. 58). The\nECG in LBBB is illustrated in Figure 59.

The posterior division supplies the posterior and inferior portions. If one fascicle\nis blocked, depolarization occurs via the other fascicle and spreads more slowly into the \"block\"\narea. The major effect of this change in depolarization sequence is a shift in the electrical axis of the\nheart. The QRS complex is not significantly widened. In left anterior hemiblock (Fig. 60) the\nposterior portion of the left ventricle depolarizes first, followed by the anterior and superior\nportions. The resultant shift in the temporal course of the heart vector causes a significant shift in\nthe mean electrical axis toward the left. The axis is usually more negative than -30 degrees--often\nmore than -60 degrees. (See Figure 61.)\nClinical Electrocardiography\nI\nII\nIII\naVR\naVL\naVF\nV1\nV2\nV3\nV4\nV5\nV6\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 60 - Left Anterior Hemiblock\nBlock in\nAnterior\nFascicle\nLate Left\nActivation\nActivation of\nLeft Anterior\nFascicle Distal\nPurkinje Fibers\nVentricular\nto Block, Via\nInitial Left Ventricular Activation Via Posterior Fascicle\nFigure by MIT OCW.

This QRS axis may be in the wide range of normal, and can be a\nmanifestation of right ventricular hypertrophy or lateral wall myocardial infarction. Hence, the ECG\ndiagnosis of left posterior hemiblock is difficult, and requires exclusion of possible right ventricular\nhypertrophy or old infarction.\nBifascicular block is used to indicate the ECG finding of complete right bundle branch\nblock in combination with left axis deviation which implies left anterior hemiblock (see Figure 64).\nIn this situation two of the three major portions of the ventricular conduction system are blocked.\nTrifascicular block is used to describe the ECG finding of bilateral bundle branch block and\na prolonged PR interval indicating first degree AV block. Although the latter could represent delay\nin the AV node, it more likely represents incomplete block in the remaining intact fascicle of the\nconduction system (Figures 65 and 66). Patients with this finding are at increased risk of\ndeveloping complete AV block.\nFigure 62 - Left Posterior Hemiblock\nI nitial L eft Ventricular\nj\nA ctivation V ia A nterior\nFascicle\nA ctivation of Posterior\nFascicle Distal to B lock\nV ia Purkin e Fibers\nB lock in Posterior\nFascicle\nL ate L eft Ventricular A ctivation\nFigure by MIT OCW.

The q waves in V2-3 do not necessarily indicate anterior wall infarction.\n\n5. Survey of additional ECG Abnormalities\n5.1\nHypertrophy Patterns\nIn some pathological conditions certain chambers of the heart may be required to perform\nincreased levels of mechanical work. For example, with hypertension (high blood pressure) the left\nventricle must generate abnormally high pressures. In mitral stenosis (a narrowing of the mitral\nvalve) the left atrium must generate increased pressure to maintain an adequate blood flow through\nthe narrow valve. In response to the increased work load, the muscle cells of the affected chamber\nincrease in volume and in contractile elements. This hypertrophy of muscle is reflected in the\nelectrocardiogram by an increased magnitude of the heart vector. In addition, conduction times may\nbe increased since the muscle mass and volume increases. Hypertrophy of specific chambers is\nreflected in characteristic changes in the ECG waveforms.\nLeft Atrial Hypertrophy (P-mitrale)\nAs the excitation wave of the heart travels from the SA node to the AV node, the right atrium\nis depolarized before the left atrium. The P-wave is the electrical sum of both depolarizations. In left\natrial hypertrophy the left atrial contribution becomes more pronounced, resulting in a wide (greater\nthan 0.11 sec) notched P-wave. In lead V1, the wave is diphasic with a large terminal negative\nsweep. Figure 67 illustrates the classical picture of the left atrial hypertrophy in a case of mitral\nstenosis.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 67 - Left atrial hypertrophy.\nNote the broad, notched P waves in standard and extremity leads and V4-6. The characteristic diphasic P wave with a\nwide negative component is seen in V1. Clinical diagnosis: Mitral stenosis.\n.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nRight Atrial Hypertrophy (P-Pulmonale)\nTall, slender, peaked P-waves in leads II, III, aVF are characteristic of right atrial\nhypertrophy. The P-waves in lead V1 may be prominent, peaked, diphasic or inverted. Right atrial\nhypertrophy may be seen in tricuspid stenosis or regurgitation, congenital heart defects such as\natrial septal defect, or secondary to right ventricular overload. Right atrial hypertrophy is often seen\nin patients with severe lung disease and increased pulmonary artery pressure--hence the name\n\"P-pulmonale\". Figure 68 illustrates right atrial hypertrophy.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 68 - Right atrial hypertrophy.\nThere are tall, peaked P waves in II, III, and aVF. A deeply inverted and slender P wave is seen in V1. The QRS and\nT abnormalities are indicative of right ventricular hypertrophy. Clinical and autopsy diagnosis: Severe chronic\nobstructive lung disease; right atrial and ventricular hypertrophy.\n.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nLeft Ventricular Hypertrophy\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) leads to changes in the amplitude of the QRS complex,\nthe duration of the QRS, the electrical axis, and in ST-T wave morphology. The amplitude of the\nQRS is increased and the ECG diagnosis of LVH requires one or more of the following criteria:\na.\nThe sum of the largest S-wave in V1 or V2 and the largest R-wave in V5 or V6 ≥ 3.5\nmV.\nb.\nThe largest S-wave in V1 or V2 ≥ 2.5 mV.\nc.\nThe largest R-wave in V5 or V6 ≥ 2.5 mV.\nd.\nThe largest R-wave in a limb lead ≥ 1.3 mV.\ne.\nThe sum of the R in lead I and the S in lead III ≥ 2.5 mV.\nThe duration of the QRS complex is usually slightly prolonged, but generally not beyond\n0.12 seconds.\nThe electrical axis is usually shifted to the left beyond -30 .\nST-T wave changes are usually seen in LVH. ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion\nare common.\nFigure 69 illustrates the ECG findings of LVH. This condition may result from a number of\nclinical states including: hypertension, aortic stenosis of regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, long-\nstanding coronary artery disease, and certain congenital diseases such as patent ductus arteriosus\nand coartation of the aorta.\nClinical Electrocardiography\n\nFigure 69 - LVH\nRight Ventricular Hypertrophy\nRight ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) may occur with mitral stenosis, pulmonary\nhypertension, pulmonic stenosis, severe pulmonary disease and certain forms of congenital heart\ndisease. The ECG changes seen with RVH are often more difficult to detect than those associated\nwith LVH. The changes are related to the QRS vector: it is increased in magnitude and its course is\nskewed in the direction of the right ventricle. Any of the following criteria suggest RVH:\na.\nRight axis deviation ≥ +110 .\nb.\nR wave in V1 ≥ 0.7 mV.\nc.\nS wave in V5 or V6 ≥ 0.7 mV.\nd.\nR/S ratio in V1 > 1.0.\ne.\nR/S ratio in V6 < 1.j\nFigure 70 illustrates RVH.\nClinical Electrocardiography\nI\nII\nIII\naVR\naVL\naVF\nV1\nV2\nV3\nV4\nV5\nV6\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 70 - RVH\n5.2 Ischemia, Injury, and Infarction\nIschemia of myocardial tissue causes shortening of the action potential, particularly in the\nendocardial areas. As a result, repolarization begins at the endocardial surface and propagates\ntoward epicardium (exactly the opposite of normal). The change of repolarization is reflected in T-\nwave inversion, and in some cases ST-segment straightening and depression. Thus, ischemia may\nbe manifested as T-waves of opposite polarity to QRS complexes. This change unfortunately is not\nspecific, since other conditions lead to T-wave abnormalities (LVH, bundle branch blocks, etc.).

(2) There is a reversed\nprecordial QRS transition with tall RV1 and delayed onset of the intrinsicoid deflection (0.05 second) in lead V1. (3)\nInitial R waves (without normal septal Q waves) in leads I, aVL, and V6 suggest that initial septal activation\nproduces forces directed to the left and posteriorly (a not infrequent finding in right ventricular hypertrophy).\n\nthe other hand, if serial ECGs show systematic T-wave inversions, the evidence for ischemia may be\nstronger.\nInjury of myocardial cells refers to damage such that groups of cells partially depolarize.\nThis damage may be reversible or may proceed to death of cells (infarction). Injury of\nsubendocardial cells leads to ST-segment depression. Subepicardial injury leads to ST-segment\nelevation. Figure 71 presents a model to explain these observations. During phase 4 there is a DC\npotential (\"injury potential\") created by virtue of the boundary between partially depolarized cells\nand normal myocardium. Since ECG machines are AC coupled, this shift is not registered. During\nthe plateau of the action potential all myocardial cells are depolarized and the potential of the\nelectrode falls to zero. This leads to an apparent depression of the ST-segment. The opposite\nargument holds for why subepicardial injury leads to ST-segment elevation.\nInfarcted cells are dead, and electrically unexcitable. Absence of the ability to conduct the\naction potential in a region of infarction causes a dramatic change in the magnitude and direction of\nthe equivalent heart vector. In particular, positive R-waves may disappear and be replaced by\nnegative Q-waves. In actual myocardial infarctions a sequence of injury followed by infarction is\nusually seen. ST-segment elevation is seen early (hours-day), followed by loss of R-wave voltage\nand Q-wave development (day-days) and T-wave inversion. As time goes on, the ST-segment shift\nreturns to baseline (days to weeks), and still later the T-waves may normalize. The Q-waves persist\npermanently, however, reflecting replacement of normal muscle by scar tissue.

As a result, a diastolic current of injury flows between the two regions.\nThis can be treated as a current vector, i, originating from E, resulting in measurement of a positive potential at the\nrecording electrode. Althought, the baseline is deflected upward, clinical ECG machines are AC coupled, and do not\nrecord DC shifts. After depolarization, the wedge of muscle is electrically neutral, the diastolic injury current\ndisappears, and the electrocardiographic tracing returns to its preinjury base line. Later, as the muscle repolarizes,\nthe injury current reappears and the tracing gradually returns to the postinjury level. On the electrocardiogram, this\nresults in a depressed S-T segment. (B) Subepicardial injury, in contrast, leads to a reverse polarity diastolic injury\nvector (I): before depolarization the original base line is depressed, while after depolarization the S-T segment is\napparently elevated.\n\nFigure 72 - Diagrammatic Illustration of Serial Electrocardiographic Patterns in Anterior\nInfarction\nClinical Electrocardiography\nI\nII\nIII\naVR\naVL\naVF\nV1-2\nV3-4\nV5-6\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nA: Normal tracing.\nB: Early pattern (hours after infarction): leads I, aVL, and V3-6 exhibit ST segment elevation while leads II, III, and\naVF exhibit reciprocal ST depression.\nC: Later pattern (many hours to a few days): Q waves have appeared in I, aVL, and V5-7, and QS complexes are\npresent in V3-4, indicating that the major transmural infarction is underlying the area recorded by V3-4; ST segment\nchanges persist, but are diminished, and T waves are beginning to invert in leads with elevated ST segments.\nD: Late established pattern (many days to weeks): Q waves and QS complexes persist; ST segments are isoelectric;\nT waves are symmetric and deeply inverted in leads with previous ST elevation and tall in leads with previous ST\ndepression.

Introduction\nThe purpose of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues of\nthe body--particularly to the brain and heart. In general, the amount of blood flow to a particu\nlar organ is dynamically adjusted to meet its current metabolic need. The cardiovascular control\nsystems operate to establish the proper cardiac output and to assure its optimal distribution to the\nvarious organs of the body. The highest priority is to assure adequate perfusion of the brain, and if\nnecessary blood flow will be shunted from less critical organs to the brain.\nFigure 1 demonstrates that as the body's rate of oxygen utilization increases, the cardiac output\nmust increase in order to deliver the O2 to the tissues, assuming the arterio-venous oxygen content\ndifference is constant.1 In steady state, the rate of oxygen uptake, V O2, is equal to the cardiac\noutput, Q, multiplied by the arterio-venous difference in oxygen content. Experimental evidence is\nshown in Figure 2, demonstrating the relationship between cardiac output and oxygen consumption\nat various levels of physical exercise.\n· VO2\nQ\nHLPU\nQ\nCV(O2)\nCA(O2)\n·\nQ CV(O2) + VO2 = Q CA(O2)\n· VO2 = Q [CA(O2)-CV(O2)]\nFigure 1: Conservation of Mass Relationship\nThe cardiovascular control system is constantly challenged by a wide variety of physical and\nphysiological stresses. Some are transient and require rapid adaptive responses, while other stresses\nare more chronic and require slower (and more permanent) compensatory mechanisms. Table 1\npresents a representative list of challenges to the cardiovascular system. Adaptive responses to\nchallenges acting within seconds (such as standing or running) are mediated primarily by the au\ntonomic nervous system. Hormonal controls act within minutes to days, and would be expected to\nplay an important role in challenges such as blood loss, myocardial damage, or dehydration. Long-\nterm adaptations are required in response to long-term stresses such as severe physical training or\nhigh altitude living, and generally result in physical remodeling of tissue such as myocardium\nand/or blood vessels.\nCardiovascular control is best understood in the context of the parallel anatomical arrangement\nof organs as illustrated in Figure 3. The figure demonstrates that if the pressure in the aorta is main\n1While this assumption is not strictly true, it is reasonable for most normal operating ranges of cardiac output.\nControl and Integration\n\nDexter 1951\nDouglas 1922\nChristiansen 1931\nDonald 1955\nOxygen Consumption (liters/min)\nCardiac Output (liters/min)\nCardiac Index (liters/min/m2 )\nCardiac output and cardiac index\nOxygen consumption\nWork Output During Exercise (kilogram-metersters/min)\nFigure 2: Relationship between cardiac output and work output (solid curve) and between oxygen consumption and\nwork output (dashed curve) during exercise.

As we will see, a complex neurohumoral\ncontrol system is used to maintain a constant aortic pressure and to adjust the network of parallel\nresistances.\nThe control of the cardiovascular system is complex, and involves numerous biochemical, neu\nrological and hormonal mechanisms. The flow of blood to a particular vascular bed depends on the\nproper regulation of the cardiac rate and contractility, the intravascular volume, the venous tone,\nand arteriolar resistance. Some control mechanisms are quite local, and modulate arteriolar resis\ntance in response to the metabolic needs of the immediately adjacent tissue. These mechanisms are\nnot dependent on the autonomic nervous system or hormones, but are intrinsic to the local vascular\n6.022j--2004\n\nbed. This intrinsic regulatory mechanism is called autoregulation, and plays an important role in\nmost organs. Extrinsic regulatory mechanisms depend on complex neurohumoral mechanisms,\nand integrate the function of heart, kidney, and vasculature.\nVascular smooth muscle plays a central role in both intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mecha\nnisms since it controls arteriolar and pre-capillary resistance, and also modifies the zero-pressure\nfilling volume of the veins. Hence, we will next discuss some aspects of the physiology of vascular\nsmooth muscle.\n(\n)\n(\n)\nP\nH ead and Neck\nA rms\nL ungs\nB ronchial\nL eft A trium\nC oronary\nL eft Ventricle\nT runk\nHepatic\nSplenic\nM esenteric\nK idney afferent\nK idney efferent\nPelvic Organs\nL egs\nR ight A trium\nR ight Ventricle\nH epatic\nortal\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Smooth Muscle\nIntroduction\nSmooth muscle is present in the walls of most hollow organs of the body, such as the GI tract,\nbladder, uterus, gall bladder, ureters, and blood vessels (except capillaries). Smooth muscle is\nalso present elsewhere in the body, e.g. in the eye where it controls pupil size, or in the hair folli-\ncles where it causes \"hair-raising\". Changes in smooth muscle tension offset changes in internal\npressure, and/or control the diameter of hollow organs. In the GI tract smooth muscle coordi-\nnates peristalsis. In arterioles smooth muscle controls the resistance to blood flow. In venules\nand veins, smooth muscle controls the amount of blood stored--the zero-pressure filling volume.\nSmooth muscle is, therefore, of central importance to the control of the cardiovascular system, and\nis central to the understanding of autoregulation.\nSmooth muscle cells are characteristically spindle-shaped with single centrally-placed nuclei,\nand are typically organized into sheets. They contain the same basic contractile proteins as skeletal\nand cardiac muscle: actin and myosin, but rely on different regulatory proteins (calmodulin instead\nof troponin). In smooth muscle the contractile elements are not organized into the regular pattern\nof sarcomeres that result in the characteristic striations of skeletal and cardiac muscle. (Hence the\nname \"smooth\" muscle.) The smooth muscle contractile apparatus is demonstrated schematically\nin Figure 4. Bundles of actin filaments are attached to \"dense bodies\", some of which are adherent\nto the cell membrane. Smaller numbers of thicker myosin filaments are scattered among the actin\nfibers. Cross-bridges form between actin and myosin heads, and cyclic conformational changes in\nthe myosin result in contraction.\nRelaxed state\nContracted state\nContractile proteins\nFocal density\nAdhesion density\nCell membrane\nExternal lamina\nNucleus\nMyosin\nfilaments\nDense\nbodies\nActin\nfilaments\nCell\nA\nB\nFigure 4: Cartoons of smooth muscle cell. A. Physical structure of contractile elements. B. Contractile function.\n6.022j--2004\n\nTypes of smooth muscle\nThere are two types of smooth muscle in the body: 1) single-unit or visceral type, and 2) multi-unit\ntype. Single-unit smooth muscle is so-named because the individual cells are tightly coupled both\nmechanically (via desmosomes that transmit mechanical force) and electrically (via low-resistance\ngap junctions that transmit action potentials from cell to cell). Hence, single-unit cells function\nas a syncitium, much like cardiac muscle. Single-unit smooth muscle is found in most hollow\nvisceral organs and tubular structures of the body, including blood vessels. Single-unit smooth\nmuscle cells exhibit the property of autorhythmicity, resulting in spontaneous rhythmic action\npotentials and contractions that spread from cell to cell. The frequency of firing is increased by\nstretch. Figure 5 shows the spontaneous activity of visceral smooth muscle and that increased\nstretch results in increased frequency fo action potentials. Hormones from the sympathetic nervous\nsystem (norepinephrine) also cause increases frequency of action potentials and increased muscle\ntension. Under normal conditions visceral smooth muscle maintains a constant tension, or tone,\nthat is particularly important in the GI tract and in the vascular system.\nMulti-unit smooth muscle tissue is composed of cells that act as independent units. Each cell is\nindividually innervated, and the mechanical activity of the muscle is coordinated by nerve fibers.\nMulti-unit smooth muscle is found in such structures as the sphincter and ciliary muscles of the eye\nthat control pupil size, the large arteries, and in the piloerector muscles that cause erection of the\nhair and \"goose-bumps\". Multi-unit smooth muscle cells are not tonically active, do not respond\nto stretch, and are activated only via autonomic neural activity.\nContractile mechanisms\nContraction of smooth muscle is triggered by a sequence of biochemical events initiated by an\nincrease in the concentration of calcium in the cytoplasm. In common with skeletal and cardiac\nmuscle, contraction is initiated by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration from about 100\nnM (relaxed) to 700 nM. There are major differences between the two types of muscle, however,\nin the biochemical processes that control contraction, and also in the contractile dynamics. A\ncomplex array of electrical, mechanical, and humoral signals controls the intracellular calcium\nlevel. Although the major features are understood, unraveling the detailed mechanisms of smooth\nmuscle physiology is still an active research area.\nHow does intracellular calcium control contraction in smooth muscle?\nThe contraction of smooth muscle is accomplished by the same basic actin-myosin sliding filament\nmachinery as in other muscle types. The myosin head attaches to the actin filament, changes its\nconfiguration--thereby shortening the actin-myosin structure--then releases itself and repeats the\ncycle. In order to bind to actin, the myosin head must be phosphorylated. The phosporylation step\ncannot take place, however, without the presence of the activated form of the enzyme myosin light-\nchain kinase (MLCK) in the presence of ATP. The MLCK is activated by the regulatory protein\ncalmodulin, provided it has been bound to calcium. The concentration of intracellular calcium,\ntherefore, is critical in initiating smooth muscle contraction. Figure 6 reviews the sequence of\nbiochemical events leading to contraction, and Figure 7 illustrates in cartoon form the biochemical\npathways leading to smooth muscle contraction. Notice that the level of intracellular calcium\nControl and Integration\n\nW:L\nmV\n0.40\n0.64\n0.81\n0.91\n1.14\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\nsec\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 5: Action potentials and tension in a strip of intestinal smooth muscle showing increased frequency of sponta\nneous action potentials in response to increased tension.\ndetermines the amount of available activated MLCK. Note also that smooth muscle contraction is\ncontrolled by calcium-mediated changes in the myosin thick filaments in contrast to skeletal and\ncardiac muscle where the calcium-mediated changes occur in the thin actin filaments. Another\ncontrast between smooth muscle and striated muscle is that the latter contracts only in response\nto an action potential that triggers calcium entry into the cytosol from outside the cell and from\nthe SR. Smooth muscle cells also develop tension in response to an action potential, but may\nalso contract in response to calcium concentration increases caused by the opening of ligand- or\nstretch-mediated calcium channels.\nThe dynamics of smooth muscle contraction are two to three orders of magnitude slower than\nin skeletal and cardiac muscle.

Significantly, however,\nthe energy required to maintain tension in smooth muscle is much less then in striated muscle. A\nmuscle \"twitch\" may last from 3 to 30 seconds in smooth muscle, and in fact the smooth muscle in\nmany organs--including blood vessels--maintains indefinitely a continuous (or tonic) contraction\nwith minimal energy expenditure.

Calcium enters the cytoplasm through voltage or ligand gated\nmembrane channels, or it can be released from intracellular stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).\nIntracellular store calcium release involves stimulating ligand activation of a series of second messangers to\nproduce inositol triphosphate IP3. IP3 binds to Ca++ receptors on the SR membrane and increases cytoplasmic\n[Ca++]. When cytoplasmic calcium reaches a threshold, contraction is initiated. Intracellular Ca++ forms\ncomplexes with calmodulin (CaM); a regulatory protein that activates the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK),\nwhich in turn phosphorylates one of the light chains of the myosin molecule and allows the myosin head to bind\nthe actin filament, causing muscle contraction. (From Barany, M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction.\nAcademic Press, 1996).\n\nenergy expenditure is called the \"latch\" phenomenon. A possible mechanism is that the myosin\nremains bonded to the actin but stops cycling.\nRelaxation of smooth muscle occurs when the myosin heads are dephosphorylated. This is ac-\ncomplished by the action of myosin light-chain phosphatase, an enzyme that is always present and\nactive in the cytosol. If the level of activated Ca++-calmodulin-MLCK drops, then the phosphatase\nwill dominate and dephosphorylation of myosin will occur. Since [Ca++]in controls the amount\nof activated MLCK, the calcium concentration is able to control muscle contraction and relax-\nation. So the key to controlling smooth muscle contraction is the control of intracellular calcium\nconcentration.\nFigure 8:\nHow is intracellular calcium concentration controlled?\nCalcium can enter the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells in two ways: it can flow down its con-\ncentration gradient from outside of the cell through specific transmembrane channels, or it can be\nreleased into the cytoplasm from internal stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Similarly, calcium\ncan be removed from the cytoplasm by actively pumping it out of the cell, or into the intracel-\nlular reservoirs of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. At any time, therefore, the intracellular calcium\nconcentration is established by the balance between calcium inflow and outflow. The channels and\npumps in the cell membrane and SR are complex, and are controlled by a wide variety of electrical,\nmechanical, and humoral factors.\nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a storage depot for calcium within the cell. Release of\nSR calcium into the cytoplasm is controlled by a second messenger system triggered by hormones\nor neurotransmitters that attach to specific receptors on the cell membrane. For example, the\nsympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine binds to the α1 adrenoceptor on the cell membrane\nand initiates a sequence of reactions mediated by G proteins resulting in the formation of inositol\ntriphosphate (IP3) that binds to a specific receptor on the SR, causing release of Ca++ into the\n6.022j--2004\nVOC\nROC\nMembrane\nDepolarization\nAgonist\nSR\nPIP\nP\nDAG\nPK C\nIP\nPLC\nGa\nCa2+\nCa2+\nCa2+\nCa2+\n+\n+\n+\nNA\nET\nANG II\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nAgonists such as norepinephrine (NA), endothelin (ET), and angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulate Ca++\nrelease from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by binding G protein coupled receptors, activating phospholipase C\n(PLC) and causing inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation. Calcium can also enter the cytoplasm through\nreceptor operated channels (ROC) or voltage operated channels (VOC).\n\ncytoplasm. (See Table 2 and Figure 8.) The SR membrane also contains active pumps that transport\nintracellular Ca++ back into the SR.\nFigure 9: Control of calcium across the cell membrane (see text).\nCalcium movement across the cell membrane is controlled by pumps that move calcium out of\nthe cell, and by calcium channels that control its inflow into the cell. (See Figure 9.) There are two\nsarcolemma calcium pumps. One is powered by ATP and moves calcium ion out of the cell against\nits electrochemical gradient. The second pump is the Ca++/Na+ exchanger in which one Ca++ is\nmoved out of the cell in exchange for 3 Na+ ions moving in. The energy for this pump is derived\nfrom the sodium electrochemical gradient. The calcium channels, when open, permit calcium to\nflow down its electrochemical gradient into the cell. There are three types of calcium channels:\n1. voltage-dependent channels in which the permeability of the channel is controlled by the\nmembrane potential (tension is roughly proportional to the degree of membrane depolariza-\ntion in a continuous manner, see Figure 10);\n2. receptor-operated channels that are opened when an agonist binds to the channel receptor;\nand\n3. stretch-activated channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the cell.\nClearly the mechanical behavior of smooth muscle is incredibly complex, and is under the\ncontrol of a host of mechanical, electrical, and humoral factors, many of which interact. Thus,\nthe smooth muscle cell integrates many different inputs. Some signals may be carried from dis-\ntant locations by nerve impulses or by hormones (norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, an-\ngiotensin II etc.), while other signals ([H+], adenosine,etc.) may reflect the metabolic state of\nControl and Integration\nExtracellular Space\nIntracellular Space\nCa/Na - Exchanger\n(Cytosol)\n3Na\nCa\n1Ca\n++\n++\n++\n1Ca\nCa\n++\n+\n2+\nChannel\nCa-ATPase\n(ATP ADP)\n10 Mol/L Ca\n10 Mol/L Ca\n-7\n-3\n2+\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nNE\n300 nM\nT (dynes)\n10-8\nc\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\nEm (mV)\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\nTime (min.)\nEm (mV)\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 10:\nimmediately adjacent tissues. Indeed, in contrast with skeletal muscle, nervous input to smooth\nmuscle does not elicit a \"twitch\", but will simply modulate the mechanical response in combina\ntion with other signals. For example, during exercise the level of sympathetic nervous stimulation\nis high, but vascular smooth muscle in exercising muscle beds will dilate in response to overwhelm\ning humoral input from local tissues.

Intrinsic Regulation--Autoregulation\nIntroduction\nIn many organs blood flow appears to be regulated to meet the immediate metabolic needs of the\ntissue, such that even under wide variations of perfusion pressure flow is adjusted appropriately.\nThis behavior is independent of neurohumoral control, yet clearly involves changes in vascular\nresistance. The phenomenon is referred to as autoregulation, and is illustrated in Figure 11. Skele\ntal muscle in the hind limb of a dog was isolated from the rest of the animal, and was perfused\nfrom a constant pressure source. The metabolic state was constant. From a baseline of 100 mmHg\nthe perfusion pressure was suddenly increased or decreased, and the flow rate was monitored. The\nflows immediately following the pressure changes (transient flows) are plotted as open circles. The\nsteady-state flows (after 30-60 seconds) are plotted as closed circles. Notice that in response to a\nstep increase in perfusion pressure from 100 mmHg to 120 mmHg the flow increases immediately\nfrom 2 to 6 ml/min/100gm of tissue. The immediate increase in flow is partly explained by the\nincrease in perfusion pressure, and partly due to a significant decrease in vascular resistance. The\nresistance at baseline is 100/2 ∼ 50 mmHg/ml/min. The resistance immediately after the step in\nperfusion pressure drops to 120/6 ∼ 20 mmHg/ml/min. The decrease in resistance is caused by\ndilation of the arteries and arterioles by the increased transmural pressure. However, the flow then\ndrops back to nearly the original flow rate, and the estimated resistance increases to 120/2.2 ∼ 54\nmmHg/ml/min; slightly higher than at baseline. When perfusion pressure dropped to 50 mmHg,\nflow actually ceased, suggesting that the arterioles actually developed infinite resistance due to col\nlapse. However, during the following 30 seconds or so, the flow was re-established and approached\nthe baseline level. Clearly the arterioles in this experimental preparation are not behaving as pas\nsive elastic conduits! Rather, they appear to develop increased wall tension (\"tone\") after being\nstretched by an increase in transmural pressure, and to relax and increase in diameter after their\ninitial constriction (or even collapse) due to a sudden decrease in transmural pressure.\nMuscle Blood Flow (ml/min/100 gm)\nMasimum transient blood flow\nSteady state blood flow\nFlow with constant resistance\nFigure 11: Pressure-flow behavior in the\nisolated hind limb of a dog.

The dotted line rep\nresents the flow-pressure relationships\nfor a constant vascular resistance of 50\nmmHg/(ml/min)\nPerfusion Pressure (mmHg)\nThe temporal dynamics of autoregulation in the hindlimb are illustrated in Figure 12 that shows\nperfusion pressure, blood flow, and vascular resistance as a function of time after a step increase\nand decrease in perfusion pressure.

Hindlimb blood\nflow is represented by the solid curve, perfusion pressure is indicated by the long-dashed curve, and the calculated\nresistance is indicated by the short-dashed curve. Note the rapidity of autoregulation when the perfusion pressure is\neither increased or decreased.\nThe phenomenon of autoregulation is seen in many organs, including the kidney, heart, and\nbrain. Figure 13 illustrates autoregulation in the kidney. Renal blood flow remains remarkably\nconstant between arterial pressures of 80 and 200 mmHg, as does the glomerular filtration rate.\nRenal autoregulation is not affected by denervation of the kidney, but adding drugs that paralyze\nsmooth muscle abolishes it. The implication is that autoregulation is a local phenomenon that\ndepends on the behavior of vascular smooth muscle in response to stretch. It is independent of the\nautonomic nervous system and furthermore, the data from the isolated hind limb experiment rule\nout dependency on circulating hormones.\nMetabolically induced hyperemia\nIn the examples given, metabolic activity has been constant, as was the oxygen content of the\nperfusing blood. If metabolic activity of an organ increases, vascular resistance drops and the\nrate of blood flow to the organ increases (hyperemia). Figure 14 illustrates the effect of increased\nmuscular activity on blood flow to the calf of the leg during rhythmic exercise. Note that during\nthe relaxation phase of the exercise blood flow reaches levels of 15 times the control level. This\neffect is independent of the nervous system.

Cardiac output (blood flow\nto the entire body) increases in direct proportion to oxygen consumption, as was noted above in\nFigure 1. Blood flow increases in glands during active secretion, in the brain during neural activity,\nin the heart during increased cardiac work, in the GI tract during digestion, etc.\nCalf\nRHYTHYMIC EXERCISE\n(ml/100 ml/min)\nflow\nTime (min)\nBlood Flow\nFigure 14: Effect of exercise on blood flow in\nthe calf, illustrating the extreme dependence\nof blood flow on the degree of tissue activity.\nDots = mean rate of flow; crosses = flow dur\ning a few seconds relaxation; circles = flow\nduring sustained contraction. [Redrawn from\nBarcroft and Swann (1953).]\nThe resistance of a vascular bed responds to changes in the oxygen content of the perfusing\nblood in order to maintain an adequate rate of oxygen supply to meet the metabolic need of the\ntissue. Figure 15 demonstrates the increase in blood flow to the isolated hind limb of a dog when\nthe oxygen saturation of the perfusing blood is dropped. Note that the time constant of the vascular\nresponse is in the order of 20-30 seconds. Autoregulation tends to maintain oxygen transport\nto the tissue despite the changes in blood oxygen saturation. These observations suggest that\nvascular resistance is modulated by molecules related to local tissue metabolism. A number of\n6.022j--2004\n\ncandidates have been suggested, including CO2, O2, [H+] (lactic acid), [K+], and adenosine. Of\nthese, adenosine seems most likely. A reduction in local pO2 would lead to increased production\nof adenosine from ATP. The adenosine then diffuses to the adenosine receptor on vascular smooth\nmuscle (VSM) resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and lowered vascular resistance.\n30 % O2\nsaturation\n97 % O2\nsaturation\n97 % O2\nsaturation\nBlood Flow (cc/min)\nFigure 15:\nEffect of acute\nchanges in arterial oxygen sat\nuration on arterial blood flow\nto the hind limb of a dog. Note\nespecially the rapidity of the re\naction (Crawford, 1959).\nTime (min)\nReactive Hyperemia\nIf blood flow to tissue is stopped completely (or reduced significantly below steady-state values) for\na period of time (30 seconds to 10 minutes), and then the occlusion is removed, the blood flow will\nrise initially to very high levels, and then gradually return to normal. This phenomenon is known as\nreactive hyperemia and has been observed in most tissues--especially in skeletal muscle, cardiac\nmuscle and skin, and is illustrated in Figure 16. The phenomenon suggests that vascular resistance\nis under the control of locally-produced vasodilatory metabolites that accumulate during ischemia,\nand then get \"washed away\" to normal levels after flow is restored. The longer the ischemic period,\nthe more dramatic the reactive hyperemia.\nAutoregulation may be responsible for the so-called \"Anrep effect\" in the heart. It is observed\nthat when the ventricle is suddenly presented with an increased afterload the end-diastolic pres\nsure suddenly rises (as one would expect), but as the afterload is maintained end-diastolic pressure\nslowly drops--evidence of increased ventricular contractility. Why? The reason seems to be that\nduring the initial pressure rise there is a zone of relative ischemia in the endocardial myocardium.\nAutoregulation follows, with improved perfusion and concomitant improved mechanical perfor\nmance.\nFemoral arterial pressure (mm Hg)\nFemoral blood flow (ml/min)\nFigure 16:\nReactive hyperemia in the\nhindlimb of the dog after occlusions of 15,\n30, and 60 seconds.

Extrinsic Regulation\nIntroduction\nAutoregulation plays a significant role in the regulation of blood flow, but alone it is not sufficient.\nRather, an elaborate extrinsic control system exists which involves a variety of sensors and effectors\nlinked together via the autonomic and central nervous systems.\nIn general any control system must function to control some variable(s), and includes several\nfunctional components: 1) sensors or receptors to measure the controlled variable, 2) control logic,\nand 3) effector mechanisms. (See Figure 17.) In addition an appropriate communication system\nis required. What is the controlled variable in the cardiovascular system? Ultimately the system\nfunctions to regulate tissue blood flow such that metabolic demands are met. However, tissue\nblood flow per se is not actively sensed and controlled. Rather, the cardiovascular system regulates\narterial pressure rather closely, and controls regional blood flow by varying the resistance of the\nvascular beds as necessary. In addition, the system regulates blood volume to within narrow limits,\nbut the time constants of this control loop are longer.\nReference\nControlled\nError\nLogic\n-\n+\nEffectors\nSensors\nVariable\nControl\nFigure 17: Block diagram of a control system\nThe Communication System: The Autonomic Nervous System\nThe autonomic nervous system coordinates and regulates many of the body's organ systems, and\nits operation is usually at an unconscious level. The autonomic nervous system can be divided\ninto 1) afferent pathways, which carry information from organs to the brain, 2) centers in the\ncentral nervous system (spinal column or brainstem) which integrate autonomic responses, and\n3) efferent pathways which carry information to the various organs. The efferent pathways have\nbeen subdivided into two sections--the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system. A\nrough generalization would assign regulation of the base-line vegetative functions of the body to\nthe parasympathetic nervous system, and the mobilization of the body for emergency situations\nto the sympathetic system. Thus parasympathetic activity increases GI motility, gastric secretion,\netc. Sympathetic stimulation leads to increase in heart rate, rise in arterial pressure, and in general\nopposes parasympathetic effects. Most organs are innervated by both systems, and the net balance\nof sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity determines the behavior of the organ. Figure\n18 is a diagram of the autonomic nervous system.\nNote that the sympathetic efferent fibers exit from the central nervous system (brain and spinal\ncord) via the thoracic and lumbar spinal roots. The efferent pathway begins with a \"preganglionic\"\n6.022j--2004\n\nFigure 18: Diagram of the efferent autonomic pathways. Preganglionic neurons are shown as solid lines, post-\nganglionic neurons as dotted lines. The heavy lines are parasympathetic fibers: the light lines are sympathetic.\naxon whose nerve body lies within the spinal cord. This axon synapses with a \"post-ganglionic\"\nfiber that innervates the target organs. The synapses and postganglionic nerve bodies are located in\nclusters known as \"ganglia\". Many sympathetic ganglia are located close to the spine, but others\nare more peripheral (e.g. the celiac ganglion). Parasympathetic efferent fibers exit from the CNS\nvia the cranial nerves and via sacral spinal roots. The parasympathetic efferent fibers travel long\ndistances to the vicinity of their target organs where they synapse with short post-ganglionic axons.\nFigure 19 diagrams the neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system. Note that acetyl-\nControl and Integration\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\ncholine is the transmitter of the parasympathetic system and also of all ganglia. The acetylcholine\nreceptors in both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are of the \"nicotinic\" type, while the\nend-organ acetylcholine receptors are of the \"muscarinic\" type. The transmitter for the sympathetic\nnervous system is norepinephrine.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 19: The general wiring of autonomic effector neurons including identification of neurotransmitter agents at\ndifferent synapses\nTable 3 documents the responses of various target organs to autonomic nervous stimulation.\nNote that most organs have innervation from both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, and\nthat the \"operating point\" of the target organ is established by the balance of the two opposing\nneural inputs.\n6.022j--2004\n\nTable 3: Responses of Effector Organs to Autonomic Nerve Impulses\nADRENERGIC IMPULSES\nEFFECTOR ORGANS\nResponse\nResponses\nType\nEye\nRadial muscle, iris\nSphincter muscle, iris\nCiliary muscle\nHeart\nS-A node\nAtria\nA-V node\nHis-Purkinje system\nVentricles\nArterioles\nCoronary\nSkin and mucosa\nSkeletal muscle\nCerebral\nPulmonary\nAbdominal viscera; renal\nSalivary glands\nVeins (Systemic)\nLung\nBronchial muscle\nBronchial glands\nStomach\nMotility and tone\nSphincters\nSecretion\nIntestine\nMotility and tone\nSphincters\nSecretion\nGallbladder and Ducts\nUrinary Bladder\nDetrusor\nTrigone and sphincter\nAdrenal Medulla\nα\nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\nβ\nα, β\nα\nα, β\nα\nα, β\nα, β\nα\nα\nβ\nα, β\nα\nβ\nα\nβ\nα\nContraction (mydriasis) ++\n--\nRelaxation for far vision\n(slight effect)\nIncrease in heart rate ++\nIncrease in contractility and\nconduction velocity ++\nIncrease in automaticity and\nconduction velocity ++\nIncrease in automaticity and\nconduction velocity +++\nIncrease in contractility,\nconduction velocity,\nautomaticity, and rate of\nidioventricular pacemakers\n+++\nConstriction +; dilatation ++\nConstriction +++\nConstriction ++; dilatation ++\nConstriction (slight)\nConstriction +; dilatation\nConstriction +++; dilatation +\nConstriction +++\nConstriction ++\nRelaxation +\nInhibition (?)\nDecrease (usually) +\nContraction (usually) +\nInhibition (?)\nDecrease (usually) +\nContraction (usually) +\nInhibition (?)\nRelaxation +\nRelaxation (usually) +\nContraction ++\n--\nCHOLINERGIC IMPULSES\nResponses\n--\nContraction (miosis) +++\nContraction for near vision\n+++\nDecrease in heart rate; vagal\narrest +++\nDecrease in contractility, and\n(usually) increase in\nconduction velocity ++\nDecrease in conduction\nvelocity; A-V block +++\nLittle effect\nSlight decrease in contractility\nclaimed by some\nDilatation ±\nDilatation\nDilatation +\nDilatation\nDilatation\n--\nDilatation ++\n--\nContraction ++\nStimulation +++\nIncrease +++\nRelaxation (usually) +\nStimulation +++\nIncrease +++\nRelaxation (usually) +\nStimulation +++\nContraction +\nContraction +++\nRelaxation ++\nSecretion of epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine\nControl and Integration\n\nEffector Mechanisms\nThe extrinsic control system, acting via autonomic nervous system and hormonal pathways, can\nalter cardiovascular system performance via several distinct effector mechanisms:\nArteriolar Resistance\nUnder normal conditions the vascular smooth muscle in arterioles has a resting tension or \"tone\"\nestablished by a basal level of sympathetic stimulation.

Figure 21 illustrates in diagrammatic fashion that skin arterioles show the\nmost dramatic increase in resistance. Vascular beds in the brain show little response to sympathetic\ntone. (They respond primarily to pCO2 levels.) Muscle vascular beds will dilate when sympathetic\ntone decreases, and there is some evidence to suggest that some sympathetic fibers to muscle may\nactually secrete acetylcholine and have a vasodilatory effect that might be preparatory for \"fight or\nflight\". Vascular smooth muscle is not innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system except\nin genital erectile tissue (which receives parasympathetic vasodilator nerves).\nHormonal influences (see Figure 22): The adrenal medulla secretes mainly epinephrine (E),\nbut some norepinephrine (NE). NE exerts pure vasoconstrictor effects via α receptors. E acts via\nboth α and β receptors. In skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and liver, the β (vasodilator) receptors\npredominate; while skin, kidney and GI tract have more α (vasoconstrictor) receptors.\n6.022j--2004\n\nFigure 21: Diagrammatic representation of\nbasal tone and the range of response of the\nresistance vessels in muscle and skin to sym\npathetic nerve stimulation.

This region\nis richly innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) fibers. The SA nodal cells\nare also responsive to circulating E (β receptors →↑HR).

The dynamics of sympathetic and parasympathetic control of heart ratte\nare quite different.

After Guyton (1973), Fig. 9-4.\nBlood Volume\nThe first-order regulation of fluid balance depends primarily on the relation between urine out\nput and renal arterial pressure. In an isolated kidney urinary output is a strong function of renal\narterial pressure (Figure 31). In the intact organism it is a much stronger function due to neu\nral and hormonal effects superimposed on strictly hydrostatic effects (Figure 32). Thus, as BP\ndrops, sympathetic stimulation increases, constricting the afferent arterioles, causing a decrease\nin glomerular perfusion pressure. Also low BP results in renin liberation from juxtaglomerular\napparatus which acts on α2-globulin in plasma to produce the decapeptide angiotensin I, which\nis converted in the lungs to the octapeptide angiotensin II which liberates aldosterone from the\nadrenal cortex. The aldosterone cause increased sodium and water conservation (decreased urine\noutput). Finally, decreased blood volume causes secretion of anti-diuretic hormone which reduces\nurine output.

After Guyton.\n6.022j--2004\n\nSensors or Receptors\nThe cardiovascular control system includes a number of sensors which monitor several relevant\nvariables.\nLocal metabolic state\nAs discussed above local, metabolic state is sensed by precapillary sphincters. These sphincters\nrespond directly to local factors, and hence are part of the intrinsic rather than extrinsic control\nsystem. Nevertheless it is appropriate to note that overall cardiovascular control does, in fact,\nmeasure the state of local perfusion and responds appropriately to it, particularly in skeletal and\ncardiac muscle.\nPressure Sensors\nBaroreceptors play a very important role in the extrinsic control system, since they monitor central\narterial pressure which is a controlled variable. The sensors are stretch receptors located in the\ncarotid sinus and the aortic arch. (See Figure 34.) They respond to stretch of the arterial wall\ncaused by changes in the transmural arterial pressure. Afferent nerves from the carotid sinus (sinus\nnerve) return to the medulla via the glossopharyngeal nerves (IX), and the \"depressor nerve\" carries\nafferent impulses from aortic arch receptors to the vagus (X) and hence back to the medulla. The\nrate of firing of the afferent fibers is related to both the mean arterial pressure, and also to the rate\nof the change of the pressure. (See Figures 35, 36.) The baroreceptors are the primary receptors\nfor short-term, beat-by-beat control of the CV system.\nFigure 34: The location of baroreceptors and their innervation.\nThe baroreceptors are on the outside curvature of the aorta and\nsinus. The baroreceptor system ultimately uses the vagus and\nthe glossopharyngeal nerves to signal to the vasomotor cen\nters in the brain. 1, Aortic baroreceptors; 2, aortic nerves (de\npressor branches of vagi); 3, vagus nerve; 4, external carotid\nartery; 5, carotid sinus; 6, carotid baroreceptors; 7, carotid si\nnus nerves; 8, glossopharyngeal nerves.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nControl and Integration\n\nPhasic aortic\npressure\nMean arterial pressures (mm.Hg)\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nTime (sec.)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 35: Relationship of phasic aortic blood pressure to the firing of a single afferent nerve fiber from the carotid\nsinus at different levels of mean arterial pressure.\n1 sec\nMean Pressure (mmHg)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Mean pressures in five records shown, beginning at top, are 125, 80, 62. 55, and 42 mmHg. (From Neil.)\nChemoreceptors\nArterial receptors that respond to changes in 02, CO2, and H+ ion concentrations are found in\nspecialized tissues near the aortic arch and carotid bifurcations. (See Figure 37.) Under nor\nmal conditions these sensors play very little role in circulatory regulation--and if blood gases\nare within normal range very few impulses are generated by these sensors. When blood gases\n6.022j--2004\n\nbegin to deviate from normal the respiratory response is constantly controlled by chemoreceptor\nreflexes. There receptors act as an \"emergency system\" for the cardiovascular systemin the pres\nence of severe perterbution of blood gases. The average chemoreceptor output impulse frequency\nis a function of both p02 and pC02, and is also modulated by blood flow through the sensor. (See\nFigure 38). The cardiovascular effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation are intense bradycar\ndia, arteriolar vasoconstriction, and increased adrenal secretion of catecholamines. Cardiac output\nfalls, but resistance increases such that arterial pressure rises. Interestingly, stimulation of the aor\ntic chemoreceptors seems to cause reflex tachycardia. Why the different sensors result in opposite\nreactions is not clear.\nFigure 37: The location of chemoreceptors and their innerva\ntion. The chemoreceptors are in the angle of the sinus bifur\ncation and on the inside curve of the aorta. The chemorecep\ntor system ultimately uses the vagus and the glossopharyngeal\nnerves to signal to the respiratory centers in the brain. 2, aortic\nnerves (depressor branches of vagi); 3, vagus nerve; 4, external\ncarotid artery; A, aortic bodies; B, carotid bodies.\nPercent maximum response\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nPaco2\nFigure 38: Average chemoreceptor impulse frequency recorded\nfrom multifiber preparation, expressed as percent of maximum\nresponse (ordinate), in relation to changes in arterial pO2 and\npCO2 (abscissa).

If the effective perfusion pressure of the brainstem falls below 50 mmHg\nthere is a tremendous sympathetic system response with maximum vasoconstriction in peripheral\nand renal beds, and cardiac stimulation. (This is the so-called \"CNS ischemic response.\")\nControl and Integration\n\nVolume Receptors\nRegulation of blood volume is, of course, of key importance to the body. If a bolus of fluid is\nrapidly infused into an animal, urine output will quickly increase to restore intravascular volume\nwithin a few hours. The sensors involved in the \"volume receptor reflex\" actually do not measure\nvolume directly, but rather respond to stretch or distension of walls of vessels or heart chambers.\nThe most important receptors are stretch receptors located in the walls of the right and left atria.\n(See Figure 39.)\n-30\n-20\n-10\nRelative impulse frequency\nECG\na\nc\nv\nAtrial pressure\nType A\nType B\nChange in blood volume (%)\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Right: Relative frequency of impulses\n(ordinate) in afferent fiber from type B receptor when total blood volume was changed from its normal level. Change\nin atrial pressure in these experiments was approximately ±5 cm H2O for ±20% change in blood volume. (Based on\ndata of Gupta et al. and Paintal.)\nStretch receptors of similar anatomy to those in the atria have been found in the ventricular\nwalls, the pulmonary artery and the walls of the great veins of the thorax. Whether they play a role\nin the \"volume receptor reflex\" is not known. Impulses from volume receptors are carried to the\nvasomotor center in the medulla where several responses are elicited. In response to a decrease in\nvolume receptor neural output the following occur:\n1. Neural connections to the hypothalamus lead to increases in secretion rate of antidiuretic\nhormone (ADH), and in level of thirst. The result is decreased urine output and more drink\ning.\n2. Sympathetic stimulation of the kidney is increased, decreasing rates of urine flow and sodium\nexcretion. Also renin secretion increases, triggering a chain of reactions that result in fluid\nretention.\n3. Increases in the sympathetic stimulation to pre- and postcapillary resistance vessels reduces\ncapillary hydrostatic pressure thus resorbing interstitial fluid into the vascular space.\nSensors of Internal and External Environment\nAlthough the baroreceptors and chemoreceptors are the key sensors in the regulation of the circu\nlation, it is well known that a wide variety of situations exist in which signals from the external\n6.022j--2004\n\nenvironment or internal environment may alter cardiovascular function. \"Deep pain\" associated\nwith visceral manipulation, distortion of joints, testicular trauma etc. leads to the dramatic somatic\ndepressor response characterized by bradycardia, cold sweat, syncope, nausea, and weakness. Sen\nsors of external temperatures exist in the skin and lead to reflex vasoconstriction. Similarly, internal\nbody temperature is sensed by cells in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. We have already\nmentioned the ability of the medullary vasomotor center to detect and respond to ischemia of the\nCNS.\nFinally, the cardiovascular system responds to stimuli originating in the external environment\nand interpreted at the cortical level. Thus, threats as perceived via sight, sound, smell, etc. will\ncause dramatic cardiovascular responses. Obviously, a comprehensive understanding of cortical\nautonomic mechanisms is still beyond our reach, but it is clear that these higher nervous centers\nact continuously with medullary centers in control of cardiovascular function.\nCentral Control Logic\nAll levels of the CNS from cortex to spinal cord contribute to control of the circulation. The most\nessential \"control logic\" is at the level of the medulla oblongata and lower pons. This region--\nthe vasomotor center--is responsible for generation of tonic and reflex efferent impulses to all\nthe effectors in the cardiovascular system. Higher centers in the brain influence the CV system\nvia the medullary center--except for the sympathetic vasodilator pathways which originate in the\nmotor cortex. In broad terms, the medullary center functions to convert a particular combination of\nafferent signals from sensors into an appropriate set of effector responses. In general, blood vessels\nare controlled via the degree of sympathetic tone, and the heart is controlled by the interplay of\nvagal and sympathetic outflow.

The\nresults are shown in Figure 40. Note the decrease in post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve activity\nwhich corresponds to an increase in carotid sinus perfusion pressure. This drop in sympathetic\nactivity causes a drop in systemic arterial pressure as shown in Figure 41.

The discussions of this section pertain to fluid flow in general and are therefore\nuseful in a much broader context than the more specific topics to be discussed in subsequent sec\ntions. For the sake of simplicity, however, some subtleties of fluid dynamics, which are of little\npractical import to blood flow, will be overlooked. Those wanting a somewhat more thorough\npresentation but still on an elementary level, should look in any basic text in fluid dynamics.\n1. Forces acting on a small element\nWe first need to establish a convention in referring to forces of various types which may act on\na fluid or solid element. If we isolate a small cubical element of some substance (as shown in\nFigure 1), we can distinguish three different types of forces. The first two act on the surfaces of the\nelement, and are by convention termed the pressure force (associated with the direction normal\nto the surface) and a shear force (acting parallel to the surface). It is often more convenient to\nspeak in terms of a force per unit surface area, termed the pressure ( p) and shear stress (t ) for\nthe normal and tangential directions, respectively. In three dimensions, it is necessary to identify\nnine stress components in order to completely define the state-of-stress at a point in the fluid.\nThese nine stress components comprise the stress tensor. We denote the various components of\nthe stress tensor by ti j where i is the face of a small cubic fluid element on which the stress acts\n(the \"direction\" of a face is determined by a vector normal to the surface), and j is the direction in\nwhich the stress points. For example, tyx is a shear stress acting upon the y-face in the x -direction\nas shown in Figure 1. The third type of force is a body force which acts uniformly throughout the\nfluid and is usually expressed in terms of a force per unit volume. Gravity is the only body force\nwe will consider.\nεyx\ny\nx\np\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 1: Forces acting on a small element. Pressure is normal to the surface, while shear stress is\ntangential.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\n2. The Properties of a Fluid\nWe can distinguish between a solid and fluid according to the response of a small element to a\nshear force. A solid will deform as the force is applied and maintain that deformation until the\nforce is released, at which time it will return to its original configuration. (See Figure 2.) This is\ntermed \"elastic deformation\". For an ideal elastic solid (a Hookean solid) the shear deformation or\n\"strain\" is proportional to the shear stress, τ. For small strains,\nl\nτ\nG\nG dγ\n=\nh =\nThe constant of proportionality, G, is the shear modulus of elasticity.\nIn contrast, if a stress is applied to a fluid surface, the fluid will continue to deform at a rate\nwhich is proportional to the applied stress. Here the appropriate constitutive relation is between\nthe shear stress and the rate of deformation. Taking the one-dimensional case of Figure 3, the rate\nof deformation, or the \"shear rate\", is simply the velocity gradient (du\nU ). The constant of\ndy\nh\n=\nproportionality relating shear stress to the rate of deformation is the coefficient of viscosity, μ. In\nthe one-dimensional case again, we can write:\ndu\nτx y\ndy\n= μ\nh\ndg\nSTEEL\nSTEEL\nl\nε\ne\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 2: An elastic solid deforms with shear stress but will return to its original configuration.\nεyx\nh\nU\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 3: A fluid will deform at a rate proportional to the shear stress. Here the shear rate is the\nvelocity gradient U/h.\n\nIn a so-called Newtonian fluid, μ is independent of shear rate (but can depend upon such\nparameters as temperature, and liquid or gas composition). Many fluids, however, possess the\ncharacteristic that μ changes as the shear rate changes and are therefore termed \"non-Newtonian\"\nfluids.\nA plot of shear stress, τ, versus shear rate is called a flow curve. Examples are shown in Figure\n4. Curve 1 is for a Newtonian fluid in which viscosity is independent of shear rate. The slope of the\ncurve is the coefficient of viscosity, μ. It has units of dyne-sec/cm2 or poise. Water has a viscosity\nof .01 poise or 1 centipoise. Plasma's viscosity is 1.5 centipoise, and that of whole blood is about 4\ncentipoise. Curve 2 shows a behavior seen in solutions of high polymers in which the viscosity is\na function of shear rate. In the curve shown, the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rates (a\n\"shear-thinning\" fluid). The fluid shown in curve 3 behaves as a solid at low levels of shear stress,\nbut begins to flow when some critical \"yield stress\", τy , is exceeded. If the curve were linear for\nτ > τy , the material would be known as a \"Bingham plastic\".\ng (sec-1)\nεY\nε (dynes/cm2 )\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Middleman.\nFigure 4: Flow curve of simple types of fluids.\nNote that viscosity is usually associated with the \"thickness\" of a fluid. Motor oil, for example,\nis considered much \"thicker\" than water, because it is highly viscous and doesn't flow easily.\nThe property of \"thickness\" is quite different from fluid density: both water and mercury are\nconsiderably denser than oil, but both behave as \"thinner\" fluids.\nAn effect associated with fluid viscosity is the no-slip condition. It is experimentally observed\nthat whenever a fluid is in contact with a solid surface, the fluid moves at exactly the same velocity\nas the surface. There is no slippage between the solid surface and the adjacent fluid. (This explains\nwhy moving fan blades can accumulate dust.) Ludwig Prandtl, in a classic 1904 paper, proposed\nthis.\n2.1 Blood as a Fluid\nBlood is a suspension of cells in a solution of electrolytes and proteins. Red blood cells (RBCs)\naccount for most of the cells, and occupy about 50% of the blood volume. (The percent of volume\ntaken up by RBCs is the hematocrit.) The non-cellular fluid, separable by centrifugation, is plasma.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nIf blood is allowed to clot, the remaining fluid is called serum, which is similar to plasma, but is\nmissing the protein fibrinogen. Red blood cells number about 5 × 106 per mm . They are disk-\nshaped, measuring about 7.6 μm in diameter and 2.8 μm in thickness.\nPlasma behaves as a Newtonian fluid. Whole blood, however, is non-Newtonian in its prop\nerties. Figure 5 shows a flow curve for whole blood. It is a \"shear-thinning\" curve of the type\nshown in curve 2 of Figure 4. Two phenomena explain the non-Newtonian flow curve of blood:\ncell aggregation at low shear rates, and RBC deformation at high shear rates.\nShear stress (dynes/cm2)\nShear rate (sec-1)\nFigure by OCW. After Charm.\nFigure 5: Dynamic equilibrium between cell aggregate size and shear stress applied.\nIn the presence of fibrinogen and globulin RBCs tend to form aggregates known as rouleaux.\n(In the absence of fibrinogen and globulin such clumping does not occur.) As blood flows, the\nrouleaux are broken up at increasing shear rates, resulting in smaller particle sizes and lower ef\nfective viscosity. An experiment done by Chien illustrates the mechanisms underlying the non-\nNewtonian behavior of blood. Figure 6 shows the relationship between the viscosity of several\nfluids and the shear rate. All of the fluids were suspensions containing 45% RBCs by volume.\nCurve NP is for RBCs suspended in normal plasma, in which aggregates may form at low shear\nrates. Curve NA is for RBCs suspended in 11% albumin (no aggregates can form). Curve HA is\nfor acetaldehyde-hardened RBCs in albumen (no membrane deformation possible). The data show\nthat the fixed RBC suspension has a constant viscosity at all shear rates tested.\nThe separation of curves NP and NA suggest that RBC aggregates are broken up to single-cell\nsize at shear rates of about 10 sec-1. The continuing decrease in viscosity as shear rates increase\nto several hundred suggest that the RBCs become elongated in the presence of high shear, thus\ndecreasing viscosity slightly. (See Figure 7.)\nWhole blood may be considered reasonably Newtonian for shear rates greater than 100 sec-1.\nEstimates of the wall shear rates in various blood vessels are shown in Table 1 below. In all cases\nwall shear rates are above 100 sec-1.\nThe viscosity of blood is a strong function of the hematocrit. Figure 8 illustrates the relative\nviscosity of blood as a function of hematocrit.

They observed a decrease in relative viscosity when tube\ndiameter fell below 0.3 mm (Figure 10). The explanation of this effect is the fact that RBCs tend\nto migrate toward the center of the tube, leaving a cell-poor layer of plasma (of lower viscosity)\nnear the walls.\nIt is also true that the effective hematocrit in the thin tube is lower than that of the reservoir\nfeeding the tube. (The RBCs at the center of the tube move faster than the plasma at the walls;\nthus, to transport the same ratio of cells to plasma through the tube, the concentration of RBCs\nmust be lower than at the feeding reservoir.)

Res. 3:6, 1971.)\n\nIt is the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect which explains the lower apparent viscosity of blood in the\nmicrocirculation as compared to the viscometer (Figure 9).\nFrom all of the above, we may conclude that to a good approximation blood may be\nconsidered as a Newtonian fluid provided the diameter of the vessel is greater than about 0.3\nmm., and the shear rate exceeds 100 sec.-1.\n3. Conservation of Mass\nIn addition to the constitutive relation just discussed (Eq. 2.), two other concepts are commonly\nused in fluid dynamics; conservation of mass and conservation of momentum. We sometimes also\nneed to invoke the equation for conservation of energy. In the context of flow through vessels of\nvarying cross-sectional area, the principle of mass conservation can be simply visualized. Take,\nfor example, the tube shown in Figure 12.\nFigure 12: Conservation of Mass\nA fluid region has been denoted by dashed lines having two ends which are perpendicular to the\ntube axis, and a curved lateral surface which we define as being parallel to the fluid velocity vector\nat every point on the surface. This is called a stream tube.1 In steady flow the stream tube can be\nthought of as an imaginary vessel, completely contained by the actual vessel. No fluid passes into\nor out of the stream tube through the lateral surface. Furthermore, if we choose the stream tube to\nbe very small, we can ascribe a single inlet velocity (u1) and a single outlet velocity (u2) to all the\nfluid particles passing through areas A1 and A2, respectively.\nConservation of mass then dictates that the mass flow rate through area A1 (ρu1 A1) must equal\nthe mass flow rate through area A2 (ρu2 A2) where ρ is the fluid density. In blood flow, the density\ncan be assumed constant, giving\nu1 A1 = u2 A2\n(1)\nConsidering the entire vessel as the stream tube, the same equation can be written, except that u1\nand u2 must then be thought of as average velocities over the entire cross-sectional area.\n1Another useful concept is that of the \"streamline\", which is an imaginary line that is everywhere tangent to the\nfluid velocity vector.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nZ\nI\nZ\nI\nZ\nI\nI\nHaving derived an equation for mass conservation for a simple, very specific case, consider\nnow a more general formulation.\nFigure 13: Mass Flux through an arbitrary control volume\nConsider an arbitrary control volume in a fluid with a velocity field Ev(x , y, z, t ) as shown in\nFigure 13. The mass contained within the control volume is\nm\nρ dV\n=\ncv\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid and dV is a volume element. The net flow of matter through a\ndifferential surface area d Ai , into the control volume is:\ndmi\nvi\nd AEi\n(2)\ndt = -ρ E -\nwhere vEi is the fluid velocity vector at point i , and d AEi is a vector differential area pointing in the\ninward direction. By integrating over the entire closed surface of the control volume we have:\ndm\nv\nd AE\n(3)\ndt = -\ncs\nρE -\nConservation of mass states that the time rate of change of the mass inside the control volume\nmust equal the rate of mass transfer across the surface into the control volume. Hence,\n∂\nv\nA\n(4)\nρE\n∂t\ncv\nρ dV = -\ncs\n- d E\nor\n∂\nρ dV\nρvE\nA\n∂t\ncv\n+\ncs\n- d E =\nIf we deal with incompressible fluids (such as blood) (ρ = const.) then the left-hand side of eq.\n(4) is zero, and we have,\nv\nd AE\n(5)\ncs\nE -\n=\n\nEr - E =\nZ\nAn alternative formulation, useful when the velocity field varies in both magnitude and direc\ntion, can be derived from equation 5 using Green's theorem, and states that for an incompressible\nfluid,\nv\n(6)\nThis is called the continuity equation.\nThe evaluation of the integral in equation 5 to the tube depicted in Figure 12 is quite simple if\nwe assume that the velocities are constant across each section:\nA1u1 -A2u2 =\nor\nA1u1 = A2u2 = Q\n(7)\nas in equation 1.\nA more general statement for this situation is:\nu(r )\nr\nconstant\n2πr E\nA\n- dE =\nEquation 7 states that in a conduit of varying cross-sectional areas, the flow velocity must vary\ninversely with the area of the tube. This principle may be applied to the circulation as a whole\nin order to estimate blood velocity at various points. The table below documents the geometry of\nthe mesenteric vascular bed of the dog. Note that the total cross-sectional area of the vascular bed\nincreases almost three orders of magnitude from aorta to capillaries. As shown diagrammatically\nin Figure 14, the mean velocity in the vascular tree varies inversely with total area. Thus, if the\nmean velocity in the aorta is about 30 cm/sec., it would be in the order of 0.3 mm/sec. in the\ncapillaries.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nTable 2: Geometry of Mesenteric Vascular Bed of the Dog*\nTotal\nTotal\nKind of\nDiameter\nCross-\nLength\nVolume\nVessel\n(mm)\nNumber\nsectional\n(cm)\n(cm3)\nArea (cm2)\nAorta\n0.8\nLarge arteries\n3.0\nMain artery branches\n5.0\nTerminal branches\n0.6\n1,800\n5.0\nArterioles\n0.02\n40,000,000\n0.2\nCapillaries\n0.008\n1,200,000,000\n0.1\n60 ⎫\n⎪\nVenules\n0.03\n80,000,000\n0.2\n110 ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪\nTerminal veins\nMain venous branches\n1,800\n⎬\n⎪ ⎪\nLarge veins\n220 ⎪ ⎪ ⎪\nVena cava\n1..2\n50 ⎭\n* Data of F.

Conservation of Momentum\n4.1 Differential Approach\nThe principle of conservation of momentum is no more than a statement of Newton's second law\nwritten for a particle of mass, m.\nFE = maE\n(8)\nwhere aE is the particle acceleration and FE is the total force acting on the particle. However,\nwe will find it more convenient to re-write the right-hand side of equation 8 in terms of the rate\nof change of momentum, where the momentum of a particle is equal to its mass times its velocity.\nFor fluids, we prefer to use the mass per unit volume or density, ρ, and also the momentum per\nunit volume, ρvE. Hence, equation 8 can be re-written as\nd\nFE = dt (ρv)\nE\n(9)\nwhere FE is the net force per unit volume and the right-hand side is the rate of change of momentum\nwith time.\nThe components of the velocity, u, v, and w are each functions of both time and position.\nHence,\ndu(x , y, z, t )\n∂u\n∂u ∂x\n∂u ∂y\n∂u ∂z\ndt\n=\n∂t + ∂x ∂t + ∂y ∂t + ∂z ∂t\n∂u\n∂u\n∂u\n∂u\nv\nw\n=\n∂t + u ∂x +\n∂y +\n∂z\n(10)\nwith similar expressions for v and w. Equation 10 may be rewritten with the help of the vector\nnotation � :\ndu\ndt = ∂u\n∂t +\n\nvE · �\n\nu\n(11)\n\nNote that the operator vE · � ( ) is a scalar, and is given in equation 12.\n\nvE · �\n\n( ) = u ∂( )\n∂x + v ∂( )\n∂y + w ∂( )\n∂z\n(12)\nThis operator is applied to each velocity vector component, and the total rate of change of momen\ntum may be written as:\nρ ∂\n∂\nvE\nt + ρ vE · � vE =\n(forces/volume)\n(13)\nThe first term is called the unsteady or temporal acceleration, and vanishes if the flow is steady as\nviewed by a stationary observer. The second term is called the convective acceleration.\nTo complete the description of fluid motion, we must specify the forces which are acting on the\nfluid. For blood and other \"simple\" fluids, there are only three forces of interest.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nh\n\ni\n\n- Gravitational force, which is simply ρ g per unit volume acting in the vertical direction.\nPressure forces.\n-\n- Viscous forces arising from friction between the flowing fluid element and its surroundings.\n4.1.1 Pressure Forces\nSince equation 13 is written in differential form, we are looking for the local forces on a small\nelement of fluid. The local net pressure force per unit volume which the fluid element experiences\nis simply the local pressure gradient. Consider first the x -direction.\nFigure 15: Pressure body force on a fluid element\nThe force per unit volume in the x -direction will be given by:\np -\np + ∂\n∂ρ\nx dx\ndydz\n∂p\n(14)\nfx,p =\ndx dydz\n= - ∂x\nIn more general terms:\nfEp\np\n(in three dimensions)\n= -�\nThe net viscous force per unit volume acting on the same fluid particle in one-dimensional flow\nresults from the difference in shear stress between the upper and lower surfaces.\nThe force per unit volume in the x -direction due to viscosity can then be written:\n∂τyx\nτyx +\ndy - τyx dx dz\n·\nfx,v\n=\n∂y\ndx dydz\n∂τy\n∂2u(y)\n=\n∂y = μ ∂y2\n(15)\nNeglecting some subtleties in the derivation, the vector force per unit volume due to viscosity in a\nthree-dimensional, incompressible flow can be written:\nfEv = μr 2 vE\n∂\n∂\n∂\nwhere\nr ≡ ∂x 2 + ∂y2 + ∂z2\n(16)\n\nFigure 16: Viscous force on an element\nCombining equations 9 - 16 we obtain the vector differential equation for conservation of\nmomentum, also known as the Navier-Stokes equation:\nρ ∂vE\nρ + μr vE + ρgE\n(17)\n∂t + ρ vE · � vE = -�\nWe rarely use this equation in its complete form, however, since very few exact solutions have been\nfound. Instead, we make various simplifications, appropriate for the problem at hand, to reduce\nthis equation to a more tractable form. For example, in cases of steady one-dimensional flow in\nthe x-y plane we can write (neglecting gravity):\n∂p\n∂2u\n(18)\n- ∂x + μ∂y2 = 0\nand\n∂p\n(19)\n∂y =\nThe velocity profile can therefore be obtained simply by integrating equation 18 over y and apply\ning the appropriate boundary conditions.\n4.1.2 Laminar Viscous Flow in Rigid Tubes\nAs a specific example, we will consider the problem of steady laminar viscous flow in rigid tubes.\nOne solution, following directly from equation 17 written in cylindrical coordinates is given in\nAppendix A. A simpler solution based on a direct application of equation 8 is given here.\nConsider a tube of radius a and length 1l, and a fluid of viscosity μ. (See Figure 17.) The\npressure at x = 0 is pa , and at x = 1l the pressure is pb. Consider the cylindrical shell control\nvolume of radius r , thickness dr , and length 1l. Since the flow is steady, there is no acceleration,\nso the total force acting on the control volume must be zero. Two forces must be considered: the\nforce due to the pressure gradient, and viscous forces.\nThe net force acting on the control volume due to the pressure gradient is:\n(pa - pb)2πr dr\nf p = (pa - pb)d A =\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nFigure 17: Steady flow through a straight cylinder, known as Poiseuille Flow\nThe net viscous force acting on the control volume would be given by:\nfv(r )\n=\n=\nfv(r + dr ) -\n∂\n∂r [ fv(r )] dr\nfv(r )\n=\n∂\n∂r [2πr 1lτ(r )] dr\nSince the flow is steady:\nf p + fv\n=\n∂\n(pa -pb)2πr dr + ∂r (2πr 1lτ(r )) dr\n=\nIntegrating once, we have:\n+ k1\n2πr 1lτ(r ) = -π(pa -pb)r 2\nSince τ(r )\n∂u , we have\n= μ ∂r\n∂u\nr (pa -pb)\nk1\n∂r = -\n2μ1l\n+ 2πμ1lr\nWhen r\n0, ∂u must be zero by symmetry, so that k1 must be zero. Rearranging, we have:\n∂r\n=\n\n∂u\n-(pa -pb) r\n∂r =\n2μ1l\nIntegrating again,\nu(r )\n-(pa -pb) r + k2\n=\n4μ1l\nThe second boundary condition is the no-slip condition, namely, u(a)\n0. Hence, we have\n=\n1 (pa -pb)\n\nu(r )\nr 2\n(20)\n= 4μ\n1l\na\n1 -\na\nThis is the equation of a parabola, and the velocity distribution is shown below:\nFigure 18: Parabolic Flow Profile of Poiseuille Flow (also called Hagen-Poiseuille Flow)\nWe may now calculate the total flow, Q, through the tube.\nZ a\nQ =\nu(r ) · 2πr dr\n=\nπ(pa -pb)a2\n2μ1l\nZ a\nr\n\n1 - r 2\na2\n\ndr\n=\nπ\n8 · 1\nμ · a4\n1l (pa -pb)\n(21)\nEquation 21 is the well-known Poiseuille's law which relates flow to pressure drop for rigid\ntubes. Note the division of the terms into a constant, a viscosity term, a geometric term, and a\npressure term. Note particularly the strong dependence of flow on tube radius, a. Equation 21 may\nbe written in the form\n1l\n(pa -pb)\nQ R\nwhere\nR\n=\n= π · μ · a4\nHere R is the \"resistance\" of the tube and is directly proportional to length and viscosity, and\ninversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. Thus, one would expect that the major\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\ncontribution to vascular resistance would be made by the small vessels. This is born out by con\nsideration of the following table. Note also that the strong dependence of resistance upon vessel\nradius implies sensitive regulation of flow is possible by changing vessel diameter through action\nof vascular smooth muscle.\nTable 3: Relative Resistance to Flow inthe Vascular Bed: Calculated from\nR ∝r\nTable 2 and Poiseuille's Law\nAorta\n4%\nLarge arteries\n5%\nMain arterial branches\n10%\nTerminal branches\n6%\nArterioles\n41%\nCapillaries\n27%\nVenules\n4%\nTerminal veins\n0.3%\nMain veinous branches\n0.7%\nLarge veins\n0.5%\nVena cava\n1.5%\nTotal arterial + capillary:\n93%\nTotal venous:\n7%\nAnother common simplification of the Navier-Stokes equation involves the neglect of all terms\ninvolving viscosity. This leads to:\nv\nρ ∂\n∂\nE\nt + ρ vE · � vE = -�p + ρgE\n(22)\ncommonly referred to as Euler's equation. When using Euler's equation we make the assumption\nthat the flow can be treated locally as inviscid. In this context the inviscid assumption simply means\nthat the pressure gradient is due primarily to the effects of inertia rather than viscous stresses.\nEuler's equation may be integrated along a streamline to yield\np + ρgh + 1 ρv 2 = constant along a streamline\n(23)\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid in grams/cc, v the velocity in cm/sec, p the pressure in dynes/cm2,\ng the acceleration of gravity (980 cm/sec2), and h the height of the fluid above some arbitrary ref\nerence in cm. Instead of gram-centimeter-second units, we may use millimeters of mercury for all\nterms (1 mmHg = 1,330 dynes/cm2). In the above expression 1\n2 ρv 2 is the kinetic energy per unit\nvolume along the stream line, while p and ρgh appear as the potential energy per unit volume\ndue to pressure and the earth's gravitational field respectively. It should be noted that the relation\nexpressed in equation 23 assumes no energy losses due to friction--it does not apply to viscous\nflows. It is known as Bernoulli's equation, and is an expression of conservation of energy. Its\napplication in situations where dissipation of energy is negligible is extremely helpful. However,\nyou should note that the absence of viscosity and thermodynamic terms indicates that this is not a\ncomplete energy balance equation. Several illustrative examples follow:\n1. Vascular Constrictions:\nConsider the simple example shown in Figure 18. A tube of varying cross-sectional area\ncarries fluid in a horizontal direction. We wish to determine the relation between p1 and p2.\n\n\"\nFigure 19: Manometry: flow through a constriction\nSince the tube is horizontal, we may neglect the gravitational term in equation 23. The\nequation of continuity permits us to relate the cross-sectional areas and velocities:\nA2v2\nA1v1\n=\nA1\nv2\nv1\n=\nA2\nBernoulli's principle states:\n2 ρv 1 + p1 =\n2 ρv 2 + p2\np2v1\nρ v\nv1\n=\np1 -2\n2 -\nA1\n#\np2\nρv 1\nA2\n-1\n=\np1 -2\nThus, in the narrowed portions of the tube, the pressure drops as the velocity increases. One\ninteresting physiologic application of this finding is discussed by Burton (Chap. 10 ) in\nconnection with the arterial narrowing due to atherosclerotic plaques. Consider the vessel\nshown in Figure 20.\nAssume the vessel's normal area to be A1, with a mean pressure of 100 mmHg and a velocity\nof 30 cm/sec (ρ ≈1). If the vessel is narrowed by the plaque to an effective area only one-\nninth as large as normal, what will the transmural pressure be at the point of narrowing?\nConsider also the possible disastrous results of capillary ingrowth or cracks into plaques as\nillustrated in Figure 21. How might such geometry lead to rupture of the capillaries into the\nplaque?\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nFigure 20: Flow past an atherosclerotic blockage.\nFigure 21: Pressure differential across an atherosclerotic plaque.\n2. Pressure Measurement\nIf an obstacle is placed in a liquid flowing with velocity, vo, the liquid must come to rest just\nbefore the obstacle, and the streaming is divided into two branches one on each side of the\nobstacle. The original parallel streamlines are deformed as shown in Figure 22.\nFigure 22: Stagnation point of a catherter in flow.\nThere is a stagnation point at the tip of the obstacle (v1 = 0) and by the Bernoulli theorem,\nρv 0\np1 = p0 + 2\nwhere p0 and v0 are measured well upstream from the obstacle.\nQuestion: Extend this reasoning to the problem of measuring pressures in the arterial system\nwith catheters. Compare the pressure readings which would be obtained from a catheter with\nthe opening facing \"upstream\" (end pressure) versus one with laterally oriented openings\n\n(side pressure). Consider Table 4 below, which shows the amount and relative importance of\nkinetic energy at different cardiac outputs. Note the rather significant effect in the pulmonary\nartery. (Here, however, catheter opening usually points \"downstream\", and would come very\nclose to measuring true pressure.)\nTable 4: Amount and Relative Importance of Kinetic Energy in Different Parts of the Circulation*\nResting Cardiac Output\nCardiac Output\nIncreased 3 Times\nKinetic\nKinetic\nKinetic\nKinetic\nVelocity\nEnergy\nPressure\nEnergy as\nEnergy\nPressure\nEnergy as\nVessel\n(cm/sec)\n(mmHg)\n(mmHg)\n% of\n% of\n(mmHg)\n(mmHg)\nTotal\nTotal\nAorta, systolic\n3%\n17%\nMean\n0.4\n0.4%\n3.8\n2.6%\nArteries,\nsystolic\n0.35\n0.3%\n3.8\n3%\nMean\n0.04\nNeg.\nNeg.\nCapillaries\n0.1\n0.000004 25\nNeg.\nNeg.\nNeg.\nVenæ cavæ\nand atria\n0.35\n12%\n3.2\n52%\nPulmonary\nartery, systolic\n13%\n52%\nMean\n0.23\n2%\n2.1\n13%\n* The cases where kinetic energy should not be neglected--that is, where it is more than 5% of the total fluid\nenergy--are indicated by italic figures.

Calculation of Valve Areas\nThe Bernoulli principle provides an approach for estimating the size of the valve areas using\ndata obtained via cardiac catheterization. In Figure 23 the chamber represents the ventricle\nduring ejection.\nFigure 23: Blood ejected during systolic out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve (A)\nFluid is ejected through the orifice, and the cross-section area of the jet is A. The pressure\ninside the chamber is po, and the velocity is vo. The velocity and pressure of the fluid in the\njet are v1, p1. Bernoulli's equation states:\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\ns\nρv 0\nρv 1\np0 + 2\n=\np1 + 2\nρ v\nv0\n1 -\n=\np0 -p1\nIf we assume that v0 v1, this equation becomes:\nρv 0\n=\np0 -p1\nv1 =\nρ (p0 -p1)\nIf the flow rate, Q, is known, we have\nQ\nAv1\n=\nQ\nA =\nv1\nSubstituting from above, we have\nQ\nA = k√p0 -p1\n(24)\nIn our derivation k\n√2/ρ. The form of equation 4.1.2 has been verified experimentally\n=\nfor diseased human heart valves, but the value of the constant, k, differs depending on the\nvalve involved. Q is measured in cc/sec; p0 -p1 is the pressure gradient across the valve in\nmmHg; k is 44.5 for the aortic valve and 37 for the mitral valve; and A is the valve area in\ncm .\nNote: Q is not cardiac output, but the instantaneous flow rate through the valve at the time\nthe pressures are being measured.\n5. Reynolds Number and Turbulent Flow\nA dimensionless parameter called the Reynolds number is used as a measure of the relative im\nportance of inertial effects (related to fluid momentum) and viscous effects. From equation 23\nit can be seen that changes in pressure due to changes in fluid velocity scale with ρv 2. Viscous\nstresses in a two-dimensional flow, as noted earlier, are equal to the coefficient of viscosity, times\nthe shear rate, μ du/dy, which can be roughly aproximated for flow through a tube by μ v/d. We\ncan form a ratio, which we call the Reynolds number, between inertia-induced stress and viscous\nshear stress of the form\n\nρv 2\nρvd\nvd\nRed ≡\n(25)\nμv/d =\nμ\n= ν\nwhere r ed is the Reynolds number using tube diameter, d, as the characteristic length, and where\nν is the kinematic viscosity (ν ≡μ/ρ).\nHigh Reynolds number flow (Red 1) is dominated by inertial effects, and vicous effects\nmay be neglected as a first approximation. Bernoulli's equation (eq. 23), for example, would be\nvalid when the Reynolds number is high. When the Reynolds number is low ( 1) viscous effects\ndominate.\nIn steady laminar flow, fluid particles move along well-defined trajectories or streamlines and\nno mixing occurs between adjacent streamlines. A different kind of flow results, however, when\nthe Reynolds number is sufficiently large; a flow characterized by apparently random velocity\nfluctuations superimposed (see Figure 24).\nu\nu\nt\nLaminar\nt\nu\nTurbulent\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 24: Reynolds number predicts development of turbulence in a given geometry.\nIn contrast to laminar flow, turbulence causes each fluid particle to move down the vessel in\nan apparently random fashion in which kinetic energy associated with the axial flow direction\nis continuously converted, first into a swirling or eddy motion, and finally into heat by viscous\ndissipation.\nTurbulent flow results from an instability of laminar flow and occurs at a value of Reynolds\nnumber which depends on the local geometry. For example, flow in a tube of uniform circular\ncross-section typically becomes turbulent when Red > 2300. In contrast, flow passing from a\n∼\nnarrow orifice into a larger tube or reservoir can become turbulent at Reynolds numbers as low as\n10. Judging from the range of Red given in Table 5 below (page 37), turbulence in fully-developed\nflow is not likely to occur in the venous circulation, but flow through venous valves or past vessel\nconstrictions could become turbulent.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nWithout going into a detailed description of turbulent dissipation and the pressure drops asso\nciated with turbulence, one general statement, derived primarily from experimental observations,\nwill be useful. Due to the internal dissipation of fluid energy associated with turbulence, an addi\ntional loss or pressure drop must be included in the mechanical energy equation. For a wide range\nof geometries, it can be shown that pressure changes due to turbulence vary as the square of the\nmean velocity.\nTurbulent blood flow creates mechanical vibrations in the walls of vessels. The vibrations are\noften audible through the stethescope (bruits or murmurs), or palpable (thrills). While turbulent\nflow is common in cases of narrowed heart valves or partial obstructions to arterial flow, it may\nalso occur in normal individuals when sufficiently high Reynolds numbers are encountered. This\nis particularly likely during situations of high cardiac output such as exercise, fever, anemia, etc.\nMurmurs heard in such cases are called \"flow murmurs\" or \"functional murmurs\", and are benign.\n6. Entrance Effects\nIn our discussion so far we have assumed steady viscous flow, and have derived the equation\nfor Poiseuille flow. This type of flow is sometimes called \"fully developed\" viscous flow in a\ncylindrical conduit in which the viscous drag from the walls penetrates throughout the fluid leading\nto a parabolic velocity profile. Clearly blood flow at the proximal aorta is not fully developed\nlaminar flow, since it enters the aorta as a bolus with a uniform velocity distribution over the cross-\nsection. As the blood flows down the aorta, the viscous drag from the walls has an increasing effect\non the flow. In particular, velocities near the wall tend to decrease, and the penetration of the drag\ninto the fluid increases as the fluid continues down the conduit. Eventually the \"boundary layer\"\npenetrates to the center of the conduit and steady laminar flow is established. (See Figure 24.) The\ndistance from the entrance to the point where fully developed flow occurs is termed the entrance\nlength, L E. The ratio Le/D, where D is the diameter of the conduit, is related to the velocity of the\nfluid. One might expect Le/D to be directly proportional to v and inversely proportional to μ. In\nfact, a theoretical entrance length which agrees reasonably well with experiment for non-turbulent\nflow is\nLe\nv Dp\n0.065Red\n, where\nRed =\n(Reynolds number).\n(26)\nD =\nμ\nFor the aorta v ≈25 cm/sec, D = 2.5 cm, μ\n4 × 10-2, and Red ≡1560. Hence,\n=\nLe\n, or\n250cm\nD =\nL E =\nThis result implies that the velocity distribution in the entire aorta will tend to be uniform over\nthe cross-section. Experimental results for dogs is shown in Figure 25 which show rather uniform\nvelocity distributions almost all the way to the iliac bifurcation. Note that the above analysis\nassumes steady flow, and we have used the mean aortic flow in estimating the entrance length. The\nimportant point is that even if we neglect the pulsatile component of the flow, viscous effects are\nnot important in the large vessels such as the aorta. They become important, however, in smaller\nvessels.\n\nRegion of flow establishment Region of fully\nwith nonuniform boundary\ndeveloped flow\nwith uniform\nEntrance length\nlayers.\nboundary\nlayers.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 25: Entrance effects.\nImage removed for copyright reasons.\nFigure 26: Velocity distribution in the aorta of dogs.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\n7. Oscillating Viscous Flow\nFlow in the aorta and large arteries is clearly not steady, but rather is pulsatile. The question is-\nwhat is the nature of the flow? How much influence upon velocity profiles is played by shear\nstresses at the vessel walls? Is it possible to estimate where in the arterial system we might expect\nPoiseuille flow, and where to expect bolus or slug flow?\nAs a first approach to this problem, consider the problem of a one-dimensional oscillating plate\nimmersed in an infinite fluid. (See Figure 27.)\nFigure 27: Oscillating plate in an infinite fluid reservoir.\nThe plate, assumed to be of infinite length in the x-direction, and perpendicular to the xy plane\nis oscillated back and forth with velocity v0 cos ωt .\nIntuition permits us to predict the behavior of the fluid motion in some limiting cases. If ω\n0,\n=\nand the plate moved at constant velocity v0, eventually all the fluid would move with the plate at a\nvelocity, v0. On the other hand, it is apparent that as ω →inf, only an infinitesimal layer of fluid\nwhich clings to the plate at y = 0 would tend to move with the plate, and that fluid away from the\nplate would tend to remain at rest. For intermediate values of ω one would expect the viscous drag\nof the plate to \"penetrate\" the liquid to various distances. It would also appear reasonable to expect\nthe depth of penetration of the viscous effects to be greater as the fluid viscosity increased. We are\ninterested in getting a rough estimate of this \"boundary layer thickness\", and in applying the result\nto the vascular system.\nThe problem is solved as follows:\nConsider the control volume dx dydz at a distance y cm from the oscillating plate.\nThe equations of motion need consider only the \"mass × acceleration\" term and the viscous\nshear forces since the pressure gradient ∂p/∂x\n0.\n=\nMass =\nρ dx dydz\nAcceleration =\n∂u(y, t )\n∂t\nshear force =\n∂\n∂y [τ(y) dx dz] dy = μ ∂2u\n∂y2 dx dydz\nThe equation of motion becomes:\n\nr\n∂u(y, t)\n∂2u(y, t) = 0\nwhere\nν ≡ μ\n(27)\n∂t\n-ν\n∂y2\nρ\nThe boundary conditions are:\nv0 cos ωt\nu(y = 0)\n=\nu(y = inf)\n=\nThe solution to the differential equation is of the form:\nu(y, t)\nAe-y/δ cos ωt - y\n(28)\n=\nδ\nSubstituting back into the original equation, and recalling the boundary conditions we have\n2ν\nA = u0\nδ =\nω\n(29)\nWhen y = δ, the amplitude of the fluid oscillation drops to 1 of its maximum, and hence δ is a\ne\nmeasure of the boundary layer thickness.\nAn estimate of δ may be made for the cardiovascular system. Assume a heart rate of 100\nbeats/min. and a kinematic viscosity of blood of ν\n5 × 10-2. For H.R. = 100 beats/min.\n=\nω = 2π f ≈10. Substituting, we obtain\nδ\n0.1 cm\n1 mm\n=\n=\nThis implies that for large ( 1 mm) vessels such as the aorta the boundary layer extends only\na very short distance into the fluid. Thus, in the aorta the fluid tends to behave as plug flow, with\nrelatively uniform velocity distribution.\nUsing similar methods one may solve the problem of oscillating flow in a rigid tube. The\nmathematics is quite complex and not worth discussing here, but it does permit one to estimate\nboundary layer effects in tubes. The resultant expression for boundary layer thickness is identical\nto that of equation 29 above. It is emphasized again that fully developed laminar (Poiseuille) flow\nis to be expected only in vessels in the order of several mm. and less in diameter.\n8. Pulse wave propagation in arteries\nIn this section, we wish to develop a simple model which illustrates how pulse propagation may\noccur in the arterial system. We will represent the artery as a thin-walled elastic tube characterized\nby an equation of state relating the area of the vessel, A, to the transmural pressure, p,\nA = A(p)\nFor simplicity we will assume a linear operating region and define a compliance per unit length\nCu such that\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\n∂A\nCu\nconstant\n= ∂p =\nThis implies\nA\n(30)\n= A0 + Cu p\nConsider a section of vessel as shown in Figure 28.\nFigure 28:\nThe equation of continuity states that the net rate of increase in mass of the control volume,\n∂Q\nρ ∂A dx must equal the net inflow into the control volume which is -ρ\ndx .\n∂t\n∂x\nHence,\n∂Q\n∂A\n(31)\n∂x + ∂t = 0\nThe equation of motion equates the time rate of change of momentum to the pressure gradient.\n∂\n∂\nA)dx\n(p ·\n∂t (uρ Adx ) = - ∂x\nDifferentiating and suitably factoring we obtain:\n1 ∂u\n1 ∂A\n1 ∂A\n1 ∂p\nρu\nρ\nu ∂t + A ∂t\n=\n-\nA ∂x + p ∂x\n∂\n∂\n∂\n∂\nρu\nln u + ∂t ln A\n=\n-ρ\nln A + ∂x ln p\n∂t\n∂x\nsmall\nsmall\n\ns\ns\nWe will assume a small-signal case; that is, the variation in A with respect to time and space\nis small compared to similar variations in velocity u and pressure, p. Hence, we may neglect the\nterms containing ln A, and we have:\n∂u\n1 ∂p\n(32)\n∂t + ρ ∂x = 0\nMultiplying by A we obtain (noting that Q = Au),\n∂Q\nA ∂p\n(33)\n∂t + ρ ∂x = 0\nUsing equation 30, differentiating with respect to t , and substituting into equation 31, we obtain\n∂Q\n∂p\n+ Cu\n(34)\n∂x\n∂t =\nEquations 33 and 34 are similar to the equations governing lossless transmission lines, and\nρ/A may be identified as Lu , the inertance per unit length.\nIf the compliance of the vessel is assumed to be independent of pressure and location, and if\nthe area of the vessel is assumed to be constant (no tapering and small peturbations with pressure),\nwe may treat Cu and Lu as constants and solve equations 33 and 34.\nDifferentiating 33 with respect to x , and 34 with respect to t and eliminating the Q terms, we\nhave:\n∂2 p\nA ∂2 p\nCu ∂t 2 -ρ ∂x 2 = 0\nor\n∂2 p\nA ∂2 p\n(35)\n∂t 2 -ρCu ∂x 2 = 0\nSolutions are of the form\np = p(x -ct )\nThus pressure waves propagate at constant velocity, c, without distortion, where\nA\nc\n(36)\n=\nρCu\n=\nLuCu\nThis velocity is known as the Moens-Korteweg wave speed. The Moens-Korteweg relation\nship indicates a constant wave velocity in the arterial system. In man, pulse wave velocity varies\ngreatly--for instance it is about 3 m/sec. at the proximal aorta, and 8 or 9 m/sec. at the iliac\nbifurcation. Further, it is also true that the pulse wave distorts as it moves down the aorta. (See\nFigure 29.)\nFactors of importance which influence pulse propagation in the circulatory tree include: 1)\nvessel stiffness increases with pressure such that the peaks of pressure move faster than the low-\npressure points; 2) the arterial tree is tapered in area and wall properties; and 3) reflections may\ndistort pressure waveforms.\nPhysiological Fluid Mechanics\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 29: Contour of arterial pressure pulse in various parts of aorta. Curve 0, pulse near root of\naorta; curves 10, 20, and 30, pulse at 10, 20, and 30 cm farther down aorta.\nIn general, vessels become stiffer with age as elastic tissue becomes replaced with collagen,\nand as arteriosclerosis becomes more common. As one would expect, pulse wave velocity in the\naorta increases with age. Also, since vessels expand and become stiffer as pressure increases, pulse\nwave velocity increases with mean blood pressure (Figure 30).\nAortic pulse-wave velocity (m/sec)\nPulse-wave velocity for thoracic aorta (m/sec)\nAge (years)\nMean blood pressure (mmHg)\nPulse-wave velocity versus age\nPulse-wave velocity versus blood pressure\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Fluid Mechanics of Heart Valve Action\n10.1 Aortic Valve\nThe aortic valve consists of three thin (0.1 mm) flexible, self-supporting cusps. Corresponding to\neach cusp, there is a bulge in the aortic wall called a sinus (sinuses of Valsalva). The coronary\narteries arise from two of these sinuses.\nFigure 31: Sinuses of Valsalva of the Aortic Valve.\nIn the normal valve, blood flow is laminar, and furthermore, the reversed flow is less than 5%\nof the stroke volume. The fact that flow is observed to be laminar despite peak Reynolds numbers\nof near 104 suggests that the normal valve offers no obstruction to forward flow. On the other hand\nthe very low reverse flow at the end of systole suggests the valve may be almost closed before the\nend of systole. It also seems important that the ostia of the coronary arteries not be occluded during\nthe heart cycle.\nThe movement of the valve cusps has been studied by Bellhouse by means of a model system,\nand they have demonstrated the importance of the sinuses. The observations are:\nAt the start of systole the valve cusps open rapidly and move out toward the sinuses. Vortices\nformed between the cusps and the sinus walls. The cusps did not flutter, and flow entered each\nsinus at the ridge, curled back around the sinus wall, and then along the cusp to flow out into\nthe main stream at the points of attachment of the cusp to the aorta. Thus, the valve leaflets are\nsupported, during ejection, between the main stream and the trapped vortices.\nAfter peak ejection velocity, as blood was being decelerated ( but still moving out of the heart),\nthe valve cusps move away from the sinuses, and are almost completely closed before the end of\nsystole. Reverse flow was less than 5% of the forward S.V.\nIf the sinuses are occluded, the cusps open and touch the walls of the aorta during systole, and\nthere are no trapped vortices. The valve closes by means of reversed flow above, and back flow\nincreased to 25% of the forward flow.\nThe action of the valve may be explained on the basis of local pressure gradients in the regions\nof the aortic root. During deceleration of the blood (latter half of systole) there must be a reverse\n\nFigure 32: Vortices in the Sinuses of Valsalva in Systole.\npressure gradient in the region of the aortic outlet. In the figure below, pa > p1. If the velocities\nin the aorta and in the vortex are the same, then pc ≈pa . Hence:\n∂u\npa -p1\nρ\n1L\n= -∂t\nand hence\n∂u\npc -p1 = 1Lρ ∂t\nFigure 33: Closure of the aortic valve due to temporal deceleration.\nSince Pc -P1 is > 0 during deceleration, the valve leaflets tend to close.

On a somewhat less formal basis than the Navier Stokes equation above, he reasoned\nthat to maintain a steady flow in a tube, one had to balance the viscous forces retarding the flow\nwith a pressure drop from inlet to outlet.\nv\nIf we assume steady flow ∂\n∂\nE\nt = 0 and straight parallel flow [vE = u(x ), so (vE\nv\n0, then\n· �)E =\nequation 17 simplifies to\nv\n(42)\n-�p + μr2 E =\nFigure 35: Poiseuille Flow\nFor the geometry of Figure 35, equation 42 becomes (in cylindrical coordinates):\nd p\n1 d du\nr\ndx = μ r dr\ndr\n(43)\nThis is a separable partial differential equation.

Thus, one would expect that the major\ncontribution to vascular resistance would be made by the small vessels. Note that the mean velocity,\nv, is half the centerline velocity:\n\nQ\nv\n(48)\n= πa2 = 2 u(0)\nAlthough Poiseuille's law has many engineering applications, and although it gives consider\nable insight into flow in the circulation; nevertheless, it cannot be rigorously applied to the circu\nlation. It requires the following assumptions:\n1. The fluid is homogeneous and Newtonian. Blood may be considered as a Newtonian fluid\nonly if the radius of the vessel exceeds 0.5 mm and if the shear rate exceeds 100 sec.-1. This\ncondition, therefore, excludes arterioles, venules, and capillaries.\n2. The flow is steady and inertia-free. If the flow is pulsatile, the variable pressure gradient\ncommunicates kinetic energy to the fluid, and the flow is no longer inertia-free. This condi\ntion excludes the larger arteries.\n3. The tube is rigid so that its diameter does not change with pressure. This condition is never\nmet in the circulatory system, particularly the veins.\nMore precise models of blood flow in the circulation have been devised which take account of\nthe properties of vessel walls, inertia, pulsatile flow, etc.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

The sensation of \"squeezing\" chest pain began suddenly in the afternoon while he was\nsitting down at home. He noticed that he was sweating, and he felt nauseous, but he did not vomit,\nhe was not lightheaded, nor was he short of breath at that time.\nHe waited about 20 minutes, but the pain did not get better, and he began to feel some shortness\nof breath. He was now alarmed, and told his wife about his symptoms. She immediately called\n911, and he was taken by ambulance to the hospital.\nPast Medical History\nOver the past year, the patient had had occasional chest discomfort when exerting himself for about\na year. The feeling of tightness in the middle of his chest would always resolve by itself within\na few minutes if he rested. In fact, yesterday he had developed the same pain while mowing the\nlawn, but as usual it had resolved quickly with rest. Nevertheless, he had begun to worry about the\npains, and had made an appointment with his internist to be evaluated. The appointment is for next\nweek, however!\nMr. D used to smoke, but quit 25 years ago. His father died of a \"heart attack\" at age 65.\nThe patient's cholesterol was 208 at his last check-up six months ago. He has not had high blood\npressure or diabetes.\nThe patient had surgical removal of a malignant tumor of his colon eight years ago. Colonoscopy\nlast year showed no evidence of recurrence.\nPhysical Examination\nUpon admission the patient was alert and oriented, but acutely ill and anxious, and in considerable\ndistress with continued chest pain and shortness of breath. His systolic BP was 90. (His usual\nwas approximately 135/80.) His heart rate was regular at 100 bpm, with frequent extra beats. He\nappeared to be short of breath and his respiratory rate was 28. Examination of his chest revealed\nmoist crackles (rales) three-quarters of the way up bilaterally. His jugular venous pressure was\nestimated to be 8 cm. of H2O. His heart sounds were soft and distant, and there were no audible\nmurmurs. A soft fourth heart sound was audible. The carotid upstroke was normal, and no bruits\nwere heard. His peripheral pulses were thready and his hands and feet were quite cool.\nLaboratory Tests\nHis white blood cell count was 11,000 (nl=4K-11K), hematocrit 48 (nl=36-48), and platelets were\nnormal. Other labs were:\nSodium\n135 (135-145)\nCPK\n70 (0-200)\nPotassium\n3.3 (3.5-5.3)\nCPK-MB\n6% (< 5%)\nChloride\n108 (100-112)\nSGOT\n23 (0-40)\nCO2\n17 (21-30)\nLDH\n99 (90-275)\nBUN\n17 (6-20)\nCTnT\n0.4 (< 0.01)\nCreatinine\n1.6 (.8 - 1.2)\nIntroductory Case Study\n\nThe initial arterial blood gases (in room air) showed:\npO2=49 pCO2= 34 pH=7.42\nHe was given oxygen to bring inspired O2 to 40%, and his blood gases were:\npO2=60 pCO2= 34 pH=7.42\nThe electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, frequent multi-form VPBs, and ST elevations in\nV1 to V6, with loss of precordial R-waves. (This was consistent with an acute anterior myocardial\ninfarction.)\nThe chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary edema (fluid in the alveolar spaces).\nHospital Course\nHe was sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where angiography revealed no\nlesions in the left main coronary artery, but severe (99%) obstruction in the proximal left anterior\ndescending coronary artery. There was significant stenosis of the left circumflex artery. The right\ncoronary artery was occluded proximally and filled via collaterals from the circumflex. Balloon\nangioplasty with stent placement was performed on the left anterior descending artery with near\nresolution of the stenosis. His pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 26, and an intra-aortic\nballoon pump (IABP) was placed via the left femoral artery. He was transferred to the Coronary\nCare Unit, and at that time was free of chest pain.\nHe was treated with aspirin, heparin, IV nitroglycerine, an ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme)\ninhibitor, and lopressor to maintain a systemic arterial mean pressure between 65 and 70 mmHg.\nHe was also given intravenous doses of the powerful diuretic, lasix, to treat his pulmonary edema.\nHis course in the CCU was complicated by congestive heart failure despite the IABP. His\npulmonary edema led to worsening gas exchange, and his ABG deteriorated to:\npO2=62 pCO2= 61 pH=7.25\nIt was necessary to provide mechanical ventilation for the patient. He was intubated and\nventilated at a rate of 12 breaths per minute with 100% O2, and PEEP=0. His ABG improved\nto:\npO2=75 pCO2= 38 pH=7.38\nAn echocardiogram performed on the second hospital day showed significant damage to the left\nventricle, whose ejection fraction was only 20% (nl = >55%). The LV was enlarged with severe\nreduction in contraction of the anteroseptal areas. There was a possible thrombus in the LV apex.\nA Swan Ganz catheter was placed on the third hospital day to assist in managing his fluid balance\nand his drug regimen. By careful management of the pulmonary edema and the use of positive\ninotropic drugs (to strengthen the heart's contractility) and by using a small amount of PEEP on\nthe ventilator, his ABG improved to:\npO2=320 pCO2= 38 pH=7.38\nHe was weaned off the ventilator and the IABP was successfully weaned and removed by the\nfourth hospital day.\nHe was transferred out of the CCU to the \"step-down\" unit and remained stable. On the eighth\nhospital day he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\n6.022j--2004\n\nHis discharge medications included:\nCaptopril - (an ACE inhibitor) for afterload reduction\nIsordil - (a vascular dilator) to reduce venous pressure (preload) as well as afterload and dilate\ncoronary arterioles to improve myocardial oxygen supply\nAspirin - to inhibit platelet function and decrease the likelihood of future arterial thrombosis\nLasix - a powerful diuretic to control fluid accumulation\nKCl - to replace excess potassium loss associated with lasix use\nDigoxin - a positive inotropic agent\nCoumadin - an anticoagulant because of the presence of a blood clot in the dilated left ventricle,\nand the recent angioplasty.\nIntroductory Case Study"

It is distributed as\nintracellular water (ICW) and extracellular water (ECW).\nIntracellular water is the largest compartment, comprising approximately 40% of body\nweight. Extracellular water is about 20% of body weight. (Note the 20, 40, 60 rule for ECW, ICW,\nand TBW respectively.) Figure 1 shows the approximate sizes of the body fluid compartments.\nNote that ECW is divided into interstitial fluid (16% of body weight), and blood plasma\n(4% of body weight).\nComposition of the body fluid compartments differs markedly as shown in Figure 2.\nExtracellular fluid contains mostly sodium cations, and chloride anions. Interstitial fluid and\nplasma are very similar except for the higher concentration of protein in the plasma. On the other\nhand, intracellular fluid is rich in potassium cations and organic phosphate anions, with very little\nsodium and chloride.\nFigure 1\n(From Valtin 1983)\n2 O)\nExtracellular\nWater (20% body\nweight)\n16%\n4%\nInterstitial\n25 L\n11 L\n1 - 3\n3 L\nPlasma\nIntracellular Water\n(30 - 40% body weight)\nOsmolality (mOsm/kg H\nTotal Body Water (50 - 70% body weight)\nTranscellular\nFigure by MIT OCW.

Little, Brown.\nRenal Physiology\nExtracellular\nIntracellular\n(skeletal muscle)\nSolute composition of the major body fluid compartments. Compartments are primarily composed of\nconcentrations of electrolytes that balance charge such that each compartment is electrically neutral.\n\nWhy the difference? The intracellular compartment is separated from the extracellular\ncompartment by cell membranes. This barrier is selectively permeable, and contains active sodium-\npotassium pumps which maintain the concentration differences. Plasma and interstitial fluid\ncompartments are separated by capillary endothelium, which allows free passage of ions, but is not\npermeable to large protein molecules. Water moves freely across all boundaries.\nAlthough the ionic compositions of the body fluid compartments are quite different, all\ncompartments are in osmotic equilibrium. The normal osmolarity is about 300 milliosmoles/kg of\nH2O. Adding solutes to any compartment will result in rapid movement of water so as to maintain\nosmotic equilibrium across compartments. In all compartments, cations constitute approximately\nhalf of the osmoles. Since there is osmotic equilibrium across compartments, it follows that the\nconcentration of total cation is essentially equal throughout the body water.\nExample:\nA 70 Kg. man has a low serum sodium of 125 mEq per liter. How many mEq of sodium\nmust be added to his body to bring the serum sodium concentration up to the normal 140 mEq/L?\nAnswer:\nTotal body water = approximately 42 liters (60% x 70 Kg.).\nTotal body cation content = 125 mEq/L x 42 = 5250 mEq.\nNew cation content 5,250 + x mEq.\nNew cation concentration = (5,250 +x)/42 mEq/L\nNew cation concentration in plasma = 140 mEq/L\nFor osmotic equilibrium:\n(5,250 +x)/42 = 140 mEq/L\n5,250 + x = 5,880\nx = 630 mEq.\nRenal Physiology\n\nIn the above example it is important to note that the sodium does not enter the intracellular\ncompartment. Instead, water leaves the cells thereby raising the intracellular potassium\nconcentration from 125 to 140 mEq/L.\nNormal values for some common substances are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1\n(From Valtin 1983)\nSubstance\nRange\nAverage Value\nUsually Quoted\nComments\nBicarbonate\n24 to 30 mM/La\n24 mEq/Lb\naVenous plasma\nbArterial plasma, which is commonly sampled\nin patients with problems of H balance\nCalcium\n4.5 to 5.5 mEq/L\n10 mg/100 ml\nApproximately 50% is bound to serum proteins\nChloride\n96 to 106 mEq/L\n100 mEq/L\nCreatinine\n0.7 to 1.5 mg/100 ml\n1.2 mg/100 ml\nGlucose\n70 to 100 mg/100 ml\n80 mg/100 mlc\ncDetermined in the fasting state; so-called\nfasting blood sugar (FBS)\nHematocrit (Hct)\n40 to 50%\n45%\nAlso called packed cell volume (PCV)\nHydrogen ion\nconcentration [H+]\n(arterial)\n40 nEq/L\nNote that units are nanoequivalents per liter\nOsmolality\n280 to 295 mOsm/kg H2O\n287 mOsm/kg H2Od\ndA value of 300 is often used because it is a\nround figure that is easy to remember.

Little, Brown.\nRenal Physiology\n\nIII.\nFUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEY\nThis subject is well covered in the texts, and will not be repeated here. Students should be\nfamiliar with the anatomy of the kidney, ureters, bladder, and the detailed organization of the\nnephron, including tubular and vascular components. The anatomy of the juxtaglomerular\napparatus is important.\nRenal Physiology\n\nIV.\nBASIC RENAL MECHANISMS\nUrine formation begins with filtration of protein-free plasma into Bowman's capsule. The\nfiltrate is modified as it passes through the nephron by tubular reabsorption and/or tubular\nsecretion. Different substances are handled differently by the kidney. (See Figure 3.)\nFigure 3\n(From Valtin 1983)\nArtery\narteriole\nUrinary\ncapsule\nGlomerular\ncapillary\narteriole\ncapillary\na\nb\nc\nAfferent\nexcretion\nBowman`s\nTubule\nEfferent\nPeritubular\nVein\na.

Little, Brown.\nA.\nGlomerular Filtration\nThe formation of urine begins with a passive ultrafiltration process, in which the movement\nof water and associated dissolved small molecules is determined by hydrostatic and oncotic\npressures. Glomerular capillaries are about 100 times more permeable to water and crystalloids\nthan are muscle capillaries. Note that the plasma oncotic pressure rises as fluid moves along the\ncapillary (due to net loss of water into Bowman's space). Typical Starling forces are shown\ndiagrammatically in Figure 4.\nRenal Physiology\nSchematic of the three basic renal system functions: glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, and\ntubular reabsorption.\n\nTypical glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is ~ 180 liters per day, or 125 ml/min. Of this\nenormous amount, only 1-2 liters per day are excreted as urine, implying that 99% of the filtered\nvolume is reabsorbed.\nImportant factors in determining GFR:\n-\nBalance of \"Starling Forces\":\n-\nresistance of afferent and efferent arterioles\n-\narterial blood pressure\n-\nvenous pressure\n-\nosmotic pressure\n-\nPermeability of glomerular capillary\n-\nSurface area of capillaries\n-\nPlasma flow rate\nIn general, GFR can be increased by:\n-\nincreasing arterial BP\n-\ndecreasing afferent arteriolar tone\n-\nincreasing efferent arteriolar tone\n-\nincreasing plasma flow rate (in cases where filtration equilibrium exists).\nRenal Physiology\n\nFigure 4\n(From Valtin 1983)\nHydrostatic pressure in\nPressure (mm Hg)\nglomerular capillary\nPlasma oncotic pressure in\nglomerular capillary\nA\nB\nNet ultrafiltration\npressure\nHydrostatic\npressure in\nBowman's space\nBalance of Mean Values\nHydrostatic pressure in glomerular capillary\n45 mm HG\nHydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space\nPlasma oncotic pressure in glomerular capillary\nOncotic pressure of fluid in Bowman's space\n0*\nNet ultrafiltration pressure\n8 mm HG\n*The concentration of protein in Bowman's space fluid is negligibly small;\nLength of glomerular capillary\nthe estimated oncotic pressure is perhaps 0.3 mm Hg.\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Valtin, Heinz. 1983. Renal Function: Mechanisms Preserving\nFluid and Solute Balance in Health. Little, Brown.\nAutoregulation\nThe kidney exhibits dramatic autoregulation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration\nrate over a wide range of perfusion pressures above 80 mmHg. (See Figure 5.)\nRenal Physiology\nStarling forces involved in glomerular ultrafiltration (rat). Ultrafiltration pressure declines in the\nglomerular capillaries due to plasma oncotic pressure increase. In contrast the decline of\nultrafiltration pressure in extrarenal capillaries is mainly due to decreases in intracapillary\nhydrostatic pressure. The point at which the plasma oncotic pressure balances the hydrostatic\npressure in the glomerular capillary is termed \"filtration equilibrium.\"\n\nFigure 5\n(From Valtin 1983)\nRBF (ml/min)\nGFR (ml/min)\nDogs\nRenal perfusion pressure (mm Hg)\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Valtin, Heinz. 1983. Renal Function: Mechanisms Preserving\nFluid and Solute Balance in Health. Little, Brown.\nB.\nTubular Reabsorption\nMost substances filtered through the glomerulus are reabsorbed by the tubules of the\nkidney into interstitial fluid, and thence into the blood. Reabsorption conserves substances which\nare essential to normal function such as water, glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes. (See Table 2.)\nRenal Physiology\nAutoregulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) as a function of\nrenal perfusion pressure. The normal mean renal artery pressure is indicated by the arrow. Since\nboth GFR and RBF remain constant in the autoregulatory range (in this example, 80-180mmHg),\nthe net change in resistance must occur in the afferent arterioles.\n\nTable 2\n(From Valtin 1983)\nDaily renal turnover of H2O, Na+, HCO3\n-, and Cl in an adult human\nFiltered Excreted Reabsorbed Proportion of Filtered Load\nThat is Reabsorbed (%)\nH2O\nL/day\n1.5\n178.5\n99.2\nNa+\nmEq/day\n25,000\n24,850\n99.4\nHCO3\n-\nmEq/day\n4,500\n4,498\n99.9+\nCl-\nmEq/day\n18,000\n17,850\n99.2\nGlucose\nmM/day\n0.5\n~\n799.5\n99.9+\nTable by MIT OCW. After Valtin, Heinz. 1983. Renal Function: Mechanisms Preserving\nFluid and Solute Balance in Health. Little, Brown.\nThe reabsorptive process may be active or passive. Some reabsorption processes are\ncharacterized by a transport maximum, Tm. A good example is that of glucose. This molecule is\nactively reabsorbed, up to a maximum amount per unit time. When the filtered load is less than Tm,\nthen no glucose appears in the urine. When the filtered load exceeds Tm , then glucose is excreted.\n(See Figure 6.)\nFigure 6\n(From Marsh 1983, p. 44)\nMass Flow Rate of Glucose (mol/min)\nPlasma Glucose Concentration\nFiltered Load\nExcretion Rate\nTransport Rate\nFigure by MIT OCW. After Marsh 1983, p. 44.\nThe filtered load of glucose, the excretion rate, and the transport rate are affected by the plasma glucose concentration.\nThe rate of transport is the difference between the filtered load and the excretion rate. Note that the transport rate\nvaries with concentration when the concentration of plasma glucose is low but not when it is high. This\nrelationship suggests a saturable transport mechanism.\nRenal Physiology\n\nC.\nTubular Secretion\nThe kidney can secrete certain substances from blood in the peritubular capillaries into the\ntubular lumen. Mechanisms may be either active or passive.\nProbably of most importance to the regulatory function of the kidney is the ability to secrete\nhydrogen ion and potassium ion. This capability is central to pH regulation.\nMost of the other substances secreted are foreign to the body, such as drugs. An important\nindicator substance used in measuring renal function is para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) which is\nactively secreted into the tubule, such that it is almost completely removed in a single pass through\nthe nephron. This approximation holds only if PAH is present in low concentration.

Little, Brown.\nDefinitions:\nQ(A) = arterial flow rate (cc/min.)\nQ(V) = venous flow rate (cc/min.)\nQ(U) = urine flow rate (cc/min.)\nc(i,A) = concentration of the i-th molecular species in arterial blood\nc(i,V) = conc. of i-th species in venous blood\nc(i,U) = conc. of i-th species in urine.\nThe overall conservation of fluid in the control volume shown in the figure is:\nQ(A) = Q(V) + Q(U)\n(1)\nFor any particular molecular species, i, the conservation of mass would yield:\nQ(A)*c(i,A) = Q(V)*c(i,V) + Q(U)*c(i,U)\n(2)\nRenal Physiology\n\nUsing equation (1) and combining with (2) to eliminate Q(V), we get:\nQ(A) = Q(U)*[c(i,U) - c(i,V)] / [c(i,A) - c(i,V)]\n(3)\nEquation (3) may be used to experimentally measure renal blood flow, Q(A), if we can\nmeasure the concentration of the indicator, i, in urine and in both arterial and renal vein blood. It is\nrelatively easy to measure arterial blood concentrations, but rather difficult to measure\nconcentrations in renal venous blood (although it can be done). Fortunately there is a substance--\npara-aminohipuric acid (PAH)--which is almost completely removed from the blood in one pass\nthrough the kidney. Thus, for PAH the concentration in renal venous blood may be taken as zero -\nc(PAH),V) = 0. Under these conditions:\nQ(A) = Q(U)*c(PAH,U)/c(PAH,A)\n(4)\nThis measurement yields the effective renal blood flow. It assumes that indicator\nconcentrations in whole blood are given. If the more usual plasma concentrations are used, then\nequation (4) will yield renal plasma flow (RPF). RPF is approximately 600-700 cc/min. in the\nnormal adult. Equation (4) is an approximation, since the concentration of PAH is not exactly zero\nin renal venous blood. Note that with the appropriate catheter techniques, c(i,V) can be measured\nand exact values of RPF may be derived.\nThe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the flow rate of the ultrafiltrate into the nephron from\nthe capillary bed. How might we measure the GFR?\nIf a substance could be found which is filtered freely, but is neither reabsorbed from nor\nsecreted into the urine, then all the substance filtered will be excreted in the urine. Thus:\nGFR*c(i,A) = Q(U)*c(i,U)\nGFR = Q(U)*c(i,U)/c(i,A)\n(5)\nThe indicator substance which fulfills our criteria is a sugar called INULIN. Inulin is not\nthe only substance which can be used. Others include creatinine, vitamin B-12, and iothalamate.\nThe normal GFR is 120-125 cc/min.\nRenal Physiology\n\nClearance\nThe concept of \"clearance\" is commonly used in renal physiology. The term refers to the\nequivalent volume of plasma from which a substance is completely \"cleared\" per minute. Thus:\nCL(i)*c(i,A) = Q(u)*c(i,U)\nCL(i) = Q(u)*c(i,U)/c(i,A)\n(6)\nwhere CL(i) is the clearance of substance \"i\" in cc/min. It should be noted that in clinical practice\nthe quantity c(i,A) is taken to be the plasma concentration of the substance i, and is generally\nmeasured in systemic venous blood.\nThe PAH clearance CL(PAH) is the renal plasma flow.\nThe inulin clearance CL(inulin) is the GFR.\nRenal Physiology\n\nV.\nSODIUM AND WATER TRANSPORT\nA.\nSodium Balance\nThe volume and osmolarity of extracellular fluid are maintained within very narrow limits.\nThe amount of H2O and Na+ which are filtered each day exceed their daily intake by more than a\nfactor of 100! Thus, fluid and sodium balance depend critically on tubular reabsorption.\nSodium excretion = sodium filtered - sodium reabsorbed\nSodium excretion may be adjusted by controlling one or both of the above mechanisms.\nSodium excretion may be increased by increasing GFR, by decreasing reabsorption, or both.\nConversely, sodium excretion may be decreased by decreasing GFR or increasing tubular\nreabsorption or both.

Renin splits\nangiotensinogen to form the physiologically inactive angiotensin I. This is converted to an active\nsubstance, angiotensin II by a converting enzyme located in the lung. Angiotensin II is a potent\nvasoconstrictor, and also stimulates the adrenal cortex to secret aldosterone. This hormone results\nin increased sodium reabsorption and hence increased extracellular volume.\nHow is renin release controlled? It is renin which is the rate-limiting step in producing\naldosterone. There are several factors which may be important in controlling renin release. They\ninclude, but are probably not limited to:\nRenal Physiology\nPossible relationship between renin-antiotensin-aldosterone system dynamics and systemic\narterial blood pressure.\n\n1)\nA decrease in perfusion pressure of the renal artery (as would be expected when\nextracellular volume is depleted) results in an increase in renin production and vice-\nversa.\n2)\nA change in NaCl in the vicinity of the macula densa modulates renin release.

McGraw-Hill.\nC.\nAtrial Natriuretic Peptide\nIn 1981 Aldolfo de Bold and colleagues demonstrated that extracts derived from the cardiac\natria caused a potent natriuresis and diuresis in rats. Since then, extensive research has focussed on\nthis substance, known as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). It is now known to be a peptide hormone\nwhich is synthesized in atrial tissue, and stored as membrane-bound secretory granules.\nRenal Physiology\nMechanism of increased reabsorption and decreased sodium excretion in response to plasma\nvolume decrease. Granular cells function as intrarenal baroreceptors responding directly to\ndecreased stretch due to the lowered arterial pressure. Renal sympathetic nerves can also\nstimulate granular cells. A third signal for stimulating renin secretion is via the macula densa\n(not shown).\n\nANP has been completely characterized: isolated, sequenced, and synthesized. It is released\ninto the blood stream by atrial stretch, which generally results from increases in blood volume. The\nhormone has several different effects, all of which tend to diminish blood volume and blood\npressure. Increased ANP leads to:\n1.\nIncreased excretion of sodium (natriuresis).\nThe mechanisms include increased GFR (caused by increased efferent arteriolar resistance),\nand also decreased tubular transport of sodium.\n2.\nIncreased excretion of water (diuresis).\n3.\nVasodilation (both arteriolar and venous).\n4.\nDecreased production of aldosterone, and decreased secretion of aldosterone.\n5.\nDecreased secretion of renin.\n6.\nDecreased release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary.\nRenal Physiology\n\nVI.\nREGULATION OF EXTRACELLULAR VOLUME AND OSMOLARITY\nRegulation of extracellular volume depends not only on regulation of sodium, but also upon\nthe control of free water. Thus, not only volume, but also osmolarity may be regulated by the\nkidney.\nAnti-diuretic hormone, ADH, controls the permeability of the late distal tubules and\ncollecting ducts to water. Thus, in these regions of the kidney, the reabsorption of salt and water\ncan be controlled independently.\nADH is produced by specialized hypothalamic neurons and is transmitted via their axons to\nthe posterior pituitary gland where it is released into the blood. How is ADH release controlled?\n-\nBaroreceptors located in large veins and in the atria when stimulated by increased\nvascular volume, send inhibitory signals to increased secretion of H2O. (See Figure\n14.)\n-\nOsmoreceptors in the hypothalamus stimulate increased ADH release in the\npresence of increased osmolarity. Thus, the permeability of distal tubules and\ncollecting ducts is increased to H2O, and water is retained.\nIt is easy to see how one can excrete excess water in a dilute urine. ADH is reduced, less\nH2O is reabsorbed in the collecting ducts and distal tubules, and more H2O was excreted. The\nmost dilute urine possible is about 50 osmoles/liter.

The answer is\nfound in the countercurrent multiplier system which permits the renal medulla to become extremely\nhyperosmotic (osmolarity of about 1400). Figure 16 illustrates the end result of the counter current\nsystem, and reveals that in the presence of high ADH levels, urine may reach an osmolarity of\nRenal Physiology\nRegulation of volume in response to excess water ingestion. Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus\ndetect the drop in osmolarity and decrease ADH secretion to allow excretion of excess water.\n\nCountercurrent multiplier responsible for the formation of hypertonic urine formation.\n\nVII.\npH REGULATION\nThe kidney is critical in regulation of the body's hydrogen ion concentration. During the\nmetabolism of the average western diet, approximately 70-100 mEq of non-volatile (non-CO2) acid\nis produced, and all of it must be excreted by the kidney in order to maintain body acid-base\nbalance. The primary extracellular buffering system is the bicarbonate system:\nHR + NaHCO3 --> NaR + H2O + CO2\nThus the production of 100 mEq of nonvolatile acid (HR) will be buffered by an equivalent\namount of bicarbonate to form the sodium salt of the acid, plus carbon dioxide and water. The\ncarbon dioxide is lost via the lungs, and if the process went on this way it would not be long before\nall the bicarbonate stores of the body would be gone. The kidney's task is to reverse the process by\nexcreting 100 mEq of fixed acid each day, and regenerating the equivalent amount of bicarbonate.\nThe kidney must also prevent the loss of bicarbonate in the urine--all bicarbonate filtered must be\nreabsorbed.\na.\nReclamation of Filtered Bicarbonate\nThe proximal tubule reabsorbs 85-90% of filtered bicarbonate, which amounts to about\n4,500 mEq (25 mEq/L X 180 L/day) per day. The mechanism is sketched in figure 17. The key\nprocess is thought to occur via a Na+/H+ coupled transport system (antiporter).\nb.\nBicarbonate Regeneration (excretion of titratable acid)\nThe distal nephron (predominantly the collecting duct) is the predominant site for\nbicarbonate regeneration and excretion of acid. The key mechanism is an electrogenic proton pump\nfrom the interior of the cell against an electrochemical gradient. This pump, requiring metabolic\nenergy through ATP, is located on the luminal surface of the collecting duct epithelium. (See figure\n18.) The epithelium can generate very large hydrogen ion concentration gradients (103, or 3 pH\nunits). Sodium reabsorption is not apparently coupled to the hydrogen ion pump in the collecting\nduct cells. The excreted hydrogen ions combine in the urine with either filtered anions such as\nphosphate, sulfate, or urate; or with ammonia which is produced by the epithelial cells. In either\ncase, the hydrogen ion is \"trapped\" in the urine and is excreted as a weak acid or as the polar\nammonium ion NH4+. In order to maintain acid-base equilibrium, there must be a net acid secretion\nof 70-100 mEq per day through these mechanisms.\nRenal Physiology\n\nThe body pH is established primarily via the bicarbonate buffer system, and is given by the\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = 6.1 + log [HCO3 -] / (0.03)(PCO2)\nThe lungs are responsible for regulating the PCO2 and the kidneys regulate the bicarbonate\nconcentration. The former can act very quickly--in minutes, while the renal mechanisms are much\nslower--hours to days.\nFigure 17\n(From Seldin and Giebisch 1989)\nCell\nNa+\nNa+\nNa+\nH+\nCO2\nCO2\nCO2 H2O\n+\nH2O\nC.A.\nC.A.\nCO2\nH2CO3\nH2CO3\n+\nHCO3\n+\nH+ HCO3\n+\n?\nHCO3\n-\n-\nHCO3\n-\n-\nBlood\nTubular Lumen\nFiltered Bicarbonate\n4500 mEq/24h\nProximal Tubule\nFigure by MIT OCW.
