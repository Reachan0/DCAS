      "content": "Photo Booth\nIan Wolfe\n\nPhoto booths are places of self expression. They are places to cathartically\nrelease emotion. Uniquely, unlike a pure self-portrait, they offer to capture a moment\nmore fully with its format of 4 timed photos, allowing multiple poses or expressions in a\ntime-lapse.\n\nPhoto Booth seeks to break down this moment even further by separating the\nemotions into two vector sums. Seeking to stay true to the original sense of timed self-\nexploration, the piece moves from a pure portrait through more extreme separations.\n\nThe separations themselves seek to represent the hidden, \"ghostly\", nature of the\nunderlying emotions against our surface expressions. A frozen smile can conceal a\nsullen, smoldering anger. A mocking laugh may be motivated by fear and shame.\n\nThough photographed digitally, the only digital manipulation used is that easily\nrecreated in the darkroom. Besides contrast curves, the pieces are authentic images, true\nto the shot, the effects of which may be recreated on any film camera without double\nexposures, overlayed negatives, or transparencies, captured as a single exposure.\n\nThe effect was achieved by using a long exposure (approximately 15 seconds) in\ndim lighting, TTL flash metering, and a series of remote flashes for proper lighting."
