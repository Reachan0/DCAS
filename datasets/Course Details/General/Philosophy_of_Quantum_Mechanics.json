It's also rather bizarre-bizarre enough to lead very intelligent and otherwise sensible people to make such claims as that the universe is perpetually splitting into many copies of itself, that conscious minds have the power to make physical systems \"jump\" in unpredictable ways, that classical logic stands in need of fundamental revision, and much, much more. In this course, we intelligent and sensible people will attempt to take a sober look at these and other alleged implications of quantum mechanics, as well as certain stubborn problems that continue to trouble its foundations. Doing so will require learning some math: not the heavy-metal differential equations and approximation techniques that you need to actually start making predictions with the theory, but rather the simple, elegant linear algebra that lies behind the way physical states are represented in quantum mechanics, and that leads in a surprisingly direct fashion to most of the interesting problems that we will discuss. So, after mastering what we need of this mathematical formalism (with no prior exposure to either it or quantum physics required), we will turn to the most famous foundational issues associated with quantum mechanics: the problem of coming up with an adequate account of measurement, the question of whether quantum mechanics can and should be replaced by a \"deeper\" theory which posits \"hidden variables\", quantum logic, and (time permitting) some seldom discussed problems associated with the quantum mechanical treatment of composition and identical particles. In addition, we may (again, time permitting) take a look at recent claims that quantum mechanics will make possible faster-than-light communication, or teleportation, or massive improvement in the computational power of computers.\n\nAlong the way, we will take plenty of time out to discuss philosophical questions about science that quantum mechanics raises in new and interesting ways: e.g., what it means to attribute probabilities to physical events, what the aims of scientific inquiry are (does it aim at something\ntrue\n, or merely at something\nuseful\n?), what the role of observation is in constructing a scientific theory, what it means to say that there is an \"objective\" physical world, whether something as basic as logic can be viewed as an empirical discipline, whether there can be meaningful scientific questions whose answers cannot possibly be settled by experiment, and more.\n\nAssignments\n\nYou will have weekly homework assignments, which will sometimes involve 2-3 pages of writing (1 page = 300 words), and will sometimes take the form of problem sets. Don't even think about turning them in late, unless you have some\nmassively\ngood excuse that you tell me well ahead of time; I won't accept them. There will be 12 weekly assignments in all; you are required to do 10 (your choice, mostly; in a few cases the weekly assignment will be non-optional). If you do more, I will pick the ten best in determining your grade.\nYou are free to revise any of the writing assignments\n-provided you notify me right away that you want to do so, and turn in the revision no more than two weeks after the given assignment was handed back to you. Occasionally, I may replace the weekly assignment by an in-class quiz; the probability that I will do so will be inversely proportional to my degree of confidence that everyone is doing the reading. There is no final exam, and no mid-term.\n\nGrading\n\nThe weekly homework assignments will contribute 70% of your grade, and class participation 30%. To make it easy for you to keep track of how you're doing, I will score the assignments on a scale of 1 to 7; I will also give you regular feedback on how well you are holding up your end of class discussion. (A rough guide: think of a day's participation as being scored on a 2-point scale. Score of 0: you didn't show up to class. Score of 1: you showed up, but sat there like a lump. Score of 2: you showed up, and participated in discussion in a way that demonstrated that you had done, and thought about, the reading. Score of 3 (yes, 3): you showed up, and made all our lives richer by your scintillating, insightful discussion of the day's topics.)\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nHomework Assignments\n\n70%\n\nClass Participation\n\n30%",

Imagine someone who responds to the apparently paradoxical nature of the two-path\nexperiment in the following way: \"Look, there is just no paradox here whatsoever. The\nargument that there is assumes that we can draw inferences about what is going on when we\naren't making an observation (i.e., when we don't check to see which path the particle\nfollowed) from what is going on in situations where we are making an observation (i.e.,\nwhen we do check to see which path the particle followed). But no such inference is\nlegitimate. Science concerns what we can observe. To suppose that we can ever use our\nobservations to draw conclusions about what is going on when we 'aren't looking' is absurd.\nSo it is not puzzling or paradoxical at all that the spin-1/2 particles behave the way they do\nwhen we don't observe which path is followed.\"\n\nCritique this argument, in 2 - 3 pages. Is the author's position justified? Why or why not? In\nconstructing this critique, organize your thoughts carefully. For example, one of the first\nthings you should do is to focus on the author's second sentence, and decide whether it is\ntrue; if not, his argument obviously is less convincing. Then--with an appropriate\ntransition--you should consider what is involved in saying that \"science concerns what we\ncan observe\", and whether this claim, if true, in fact supports the crucial conclusion that \"we\ncan [never] use our observations to draw conclusions about what is going on when we aren't\nlooking.\" Finally, you should consider whether this conclusion is at all plausible. Are there\nelements of actual scientific practice that tell against it?"

Bell's Inequalities\norientation θ1\norientation θ2\ngenerator\nparticle 1\nparticle 2\n\nIn the experiment depicted above, the generator (which creates pairs of particles, sending one\ntowards each magnet) can be set up in such a way that the two particles exhibit the following\nbehavior: if θ1 = θ2, then either particle 1 goes up and particle 2 down, or particle 1 goes down\nand particle 2 up. Suppose you try to explain this behavior by means of the following hidden\nvariables hypothesis: First, for each possible magnet orientation θ, each particle either has the\nproperty (up, θ)--in which case it will (with certainty) go up through a magnet with this\norientation--or it has the property (down, θ)--in which case it will (with certainty) go down\nthrough a magnet with this orientation. Second, the particles are generated in such a way that,\nfor any orientation θ, particle 1 has (up, θ) if and only if particle 2 has (down, θ).\nNow suppose that we run the experiment many times, letting θ1 = 0° or +120°, and letting θ2\n= 0° or -120°. Then quantum mechanics gives us the following experimentally confirmed\nprobabilities:\n\nθ1\nθ2\nProb(one up, one down)\n0°\n0°\n0°\n-120°\n.25\n+120°\n0°\n.25\n+120°\n-120°\n.25\n\nWhat predictions does the hidden variables hypothesis make? That depends on the\nprobabilities assigned to the various possible distributions of the relevant properties, which are\nthese:\n\nparticle 1\nparticle 2\nprobability\n(up, 0°),(up, +120°)\n(down, 0°),(up, -120°)\np1\n(up, 0°),(up, +120°)\n(down, 0°),(down, -120°)\np2\n(up, 0°),(down, +120°)\n(down, 0°),(up, -120°)\np3\n(up, 0°),(down, +120°)\n(down, 0°),(down, -120°)\np4\n(down, 0°),(up, +120°)\n(up, 0°),(up, -120°)\np5\n(down, 0°),(up, +120°)\n(up, 0°),(down, -120°)\np6\n(down, 0°),(down, +120°) (up, 0°),(up, -120°)\np7\n(down, 0°),(down, +120°) (up, 0°),(down, -120°)\np8\n\n24.111 Philosophy of QM\nHandout #1\nSince these eight distributions are the only possible distributions, we must have\np1+p2+p3+p4+p5+p6+p7+p8 = 1.

But this\ncannot be, since the left-hand side equals 1+2p2+2p7 ≥ 1. So the h.v. hypothesis we constructed\nto explain the observed perfect correlations (i.e., the fact that when θ1 = θ2, the two outcomes are\nalways different) must be false.\nA thorny question remains: How else can we explain these perfect correlations? Answer\nthat, and you'll be famous."

      "content": "24.111 Philosophy of QM\nSpring, 2005\nAssignment #2: Bell's Inequalities (due Feb. 22)\n1. (3 points) The deterministic hidden variables theory of the correlated spin experiments\ndiscussed in class can be salvaged--even in the face of the observed statistics for the\nexperiments in which θ1 = θ2--if we assume that the choice of magnet settings on the left\nand right, on any given run of the experiment, is not independent of the state of the\nparticle pair. (This is the assumption that there is a \"hidden conspiracy\".) Show, in detail,\nwhy this is so.\nIn the experimental situation described in handout #2, it is possible to construct the particle\ngenerator in such a way (a way different from the way it is constructed in the experiments we\ndiscussed; a way such that particle pairs produced by this new generator will not produce the\nperfect correlations we examined), and to choose values a and b for θ1 and values c and d for θ2\nin such a way, that the following facts obtain:\n(i) When θ1 = b and θ2 = d, particles 1 and 2 never both go down.\n(ii) When θ1 = a and θ2 = d, particles 1 and 2 never both go up.\n(iii) When θ1 = b and θ2 = c, particles 1 and 2 never both go up.\n2. (2 points) Assume that Einstein's assumption of locality is correct--that is, that the\nbehavior of one particle in its experiment is unaffected by what is going on in the other\nexperiment. Assume in addition that there is no \"hidden conspiracy\"--that is, that the\nchoice of settings for θ1 and θ2 on any given run of the experiment is independent of the\nstate of the particle pair. Show that it follows from these assumptions that a partial\ndeterministic hidden variables theory must describe the behavior of the particles in these\nexperiments. More specifically, show that it must be the case, on any given repetition of\nthe experiment, that either the left-hand particle's behavior is fully determined (that is, it\nis fully determined, before that particle encounters its magnet, whether it will go up or\ndown if its magnet is set to a, and whether it will go up or down if its magnet is set to b),\n\nor the right-hand particle's behavior is fully determined. (Bear in mind that it might be\nthe left-hand particle that is fully determined in one repetition, the right-hand particle in\nthe next repetition, etc.) Show, in addition, that if the left-hand particle's behavior is fully\ndetermined, then the right-hand particle's behavior is at least partially determined, and\nvice versa. (\"Partially determined\" here means that the particle's behavior is\npredetermined for at least one choice of its magnet's setting.) Finally, construct a table\nthat clearly displays all the possible properties that the two particles can have, consistent\nwith facts (i) - (iii). (For \"properties\" here, we mean nothing very detailed. For example,\nthe left-hand particle will have, on any given run of the experiment, one of the following\nthree properties: (i) the property that it is certain to go up if its magnet is set to a; (ii) the\nproperty that it is certain to go down if its magnet is set to a; (iii) the property that it has\nsome non-zero chance of going up, and some non-zero chance of going down, if its\nmagnet is set to a.)\n3. (2 points) In addition to facts (i) - (iii), the following fact also obtains:\n(iv) When θ1 = a and θ2 = c, particles 1 and 2 sometimes both go up.\nShow that this additional fact guarantees that the assumptions of locality and no \"hidden\nconspiracy\" cannot both be correct."

So the h.v. hypothesis we constructed\nto explain the observed perfect correlations (i.e., the fact that when θ1 = θ2, the two outcomes are\nalways different) must be false.\nA thorny question remains: How else can we explain these perfect correlations? Answer\nthat, and you'll be famous."

      "content": "24.111 Philosophy of QM\nSpring, 2002\n\nHandout #2: Derivation of the Turbo Bell's Inequality (less formally known as the Clauser-\nHorne-Holt-Shimony inequality)\n\nSuppose we have two apparatuses, one of which can be set to perform either experiment a1 or\na2, and the other of which can be set to perform either experiment b1 or b2. (If it helps, you can\nthink of these experiments as being measurements performed on each of a pair of particles.)\nSuppose that each of these four experiments has just two possible outcomes; in each case, we\nwill label one of these outcomes \"up\" and the other \"down\". Thus, a1 and a2 might consist in\nsending one of a pair of particles through a Stern-Gerlach magnet with orientation -120° and 0°,\nrespectively; while b1 and b2 might consist in sending the other one of the pair of particles\nthrough a Stern-Gerlach magnet with orientation +120° and 0°, respectively. So there are four\npossible combinations of experiments, and in each case the outcomes will either be correlated\n(both \"up\" or both \"down\") or anti-correlated (one \"up\" and the other \"down\"). Let us finally\ndefine a random variable Cor that has value 1 if the outcomes are correlated and value -1 if they\nare anti-correlated.\nThen for each combination of experiments, we can define the expected correlation E(x,y)\n(where x = either a1 or a2 and y = either b1 or b2) to be the expected value of Cor, given that we\nare performing the combination of experiments (x,y). Thus,\n\nE(x,y) = Prob(up,up | x,y) + Prob(down, down | x,y)\n- Prob(down,up | x,y) - Prob(up, down | x,y).\n\nNote that E(x,y) is rather easy to measure experimentally: We just perform the combination of\nexperiments x and y a large number of times N, count up the number of times the outcomes are\n\nthe same (both \"up\" or both \"down\"), subtract the number of times they are different (one \"up\"\nand the other \"down\"), and divide by N.\nHere is the Turbo Bell's Inequality:\n\n| E(a1, b1) + E(a1, b2) + E(a2, b1) - E(a2, b2) | ≤ 2.\n\nBefore proceeding to the derivation of this inequality, let us just note two things about it.\nFirst--provided the assumptions needed in its derivation hold--it is absolutely universal in\nscope. That is, it has nothing in particular to do with quantum mechanics, or with any other\ntheory for that matter. Second, it is clearly violated by our correlated spin experiment, given the\nforegoing choice of a1, a2, etc. For E(a1, b1) is just the expected value of Cor, when the magnet\non the left has orientation -120° and the magnet on the right has orientation +120°; in such a\ncase, we know that the probability that the outcomes are different is .25, and so the expected\nvalue of Cor is .75 - .25 = .5. Likewise, E(a1, b2) = E(a2, b1) = .5. Finally, since the outcomes are\ncertain to be different if both magnets have orientation 0°, E(a2, b2) = -1. Plugging these values\ninto the equation, we get the result that | .5 + .5 + .5 - (-1) | = 2.5 ≤ 2, a contradiction.\nOn to the derivation. We begin by assuming that we are equipped with some theory--maybe\nquantum mechanics, maybe something entirely different--that provides us with the following\nthree things:\n(i) A set of possible initial physical states λ of the system upon which we are performing the\ncombined experiments.\n(ii) For each such state λ, and each choice of experiment combination (x,y), a value for each\nof the probabilities Prob(up,up | x,y,λ), Prob(up, down | x,y,λ), Prob(down,up | x,y,λ),\nProb(down,down | x,y,λ).\n\n(iii) For each experiment combination (x,y), a probability density ρ(λ | x,y) that\nencapsulates how likely it is that the physical state λ has one value or another, given that we are\nperforming experiments x and y.\nWe will assume that there is some way to parametrize the physical states λ so that the\nintegral ∫ρ(λ |x,y)dλ is well-defined. Assuming it is, it must of course have value 1.\nWe now make two crucial assumptions about the probabilities that our theory introduces:\nNo conspiracy: The probability density distribution for λ is independent of our choice of\nexperiment combination (x,y). Thus, ρ(λ | a1,b1) = ρ(λ | a2,b1) =ρ(λ | a1,b2) =ρ(λ | a2,b2), in which\ncase we can simplify notation by replacing all of these by ρ(λ).\nLocality: For any pair of outcomes (u,v), any choice of experiment combination (x,y), and\nany physical state λ, Prob(u,v | x,y,λ) = Prob(u | x,λ) - Prob(v | y,λ). This condition reflects the\nthought that the physical state λ contains enough information to render irrelevant to the outcome\nof one experiment what is going on with the other experiment (i.e., either what the other\nexperiment is, or what its outcome is).\nWith these conditions in place, the derivation is fairly straightforward. We first note (making\nimplicit use of No conspiracy) that\nE(x,y) =\n∫[Prob(u,u | x,y,λ) + Prob(d,d | x,y,λ) - Prob(d,u | x,y,λ) - Prob(u,d | x,y,λ)]ρ(λ)dλ.\nUsing Locality, and rearranging, this becomes\n∫{[Prob(u | x,λ) - Prob(d | x,λ)] - [Prob(u | y,λ) - Prob(d | y,λ)]}ρ(λ)dλ.\nLet us now introduce the following useful abbreviations:\nA1(λ) = Prob(u | a1,λ) - Prob(d | a1,λ)\nA2(λ) = Prob(u | a2,λ) - Prob(d | a2,λ)\nB1(λ) = Prob(u | b1,λ) - Prob(d | b1,λ)\nB2(λ) = Prob(u | b2,λ) - Prob(d | b2,λ)\nObserve that for every value of λ, -1 ≤ A1(λ) ≤ 1; likewise for the other three functions.\nPutting all this together, we get\n\n| E(a1, b1) + E(a1, b2) + E(a2, b1) - E(a2, b2) |\n= | ∫{Α1(λ)-B1(λ) + Α1(λ)-B2(λ) +Α2(λ)-B1(λ) - Α2(λ)-B2(λ)}ρ(λ)dλ |\n≤ ∫ | {Α1(λ)-B1(λ) + Α1(λ)-B2(λ) +Α2(λ)-B1(λ) - Α2(λ)-B2(λ)}ρ(λ) | dλ\n= ∫ | {Α1(λ)-B1(λ) + Α1(λ)-B2(λ) +Α2(λ)-B1(λ) - Α2(λ)-B2(λ)} | ρ(λ) dλ\n≤ ∫{ | Α1(λ)-B1(λ) + Α1(λ)-B2(λ) | + | Α2(λ)-B1(λ) - Α2(λ)-B2(λ) | }ρ(λ) dλ\n= ∫{ | Α1(λ) | - | B1(λ) + B2(λ) | + | Α2(λ) | - | B1(λ) - B2(λ) | }ρ(λ) dλ\n≤ ∫{ | B1(λ) + B2(λ) | + | B1(λ) - B2(λ) | }ρ(λ) dλ\n≤ ∫2ρ(λ) dλ\n= 2.\nWhy are we so sure that { | B1(λ) + B2(λ) | + | B1(λ) - B2(λ) | } ≤ 2? Here is one way to see this:\nFirst, remember that B1(λ) and B2(λ) have values between -1 and 1 (inclusive). For notational\nconvenience, replace them by \"X\" and \"Y\". Then if we take the square of the quantity { | X + Y|\n+ | X - Y| }, we get\nX2 + 2XY + Y2 +2|X2 - Y2| + X2 - 2XY + Y2,\nwhich simplifies to\n4X2, if X2 ≥ Y2, and\n4Y2, if X2 ≤ Y2.\nEither way, since X2 ≤ 1 and Y2 ≤ 1, we know that this quantity is ≤ 4. But that means that its\npositive square root { | X + Y | + | X - Y | } is ≤ 2."

It would be a good idea to read\nAlbert, chapters 2 and 3, and to review section VI of handout #5 (tensor products).\n1. Describe, in the abstract, what would be required of an experiment performed on a spin-1/2\nparticle in the (UP, 0°) state, in order for that experiment to count as a simultaneous quantum\nmechanical measurement of spin in two (arbitrary) distinct directions, θ1 and θ2. Note that\nthe outcome probabilities need to conform to the statistical algorithm, but that it is not\nrequired that this simultaneous measurement \"collapse\" the state of the particle. Note also\nthat the words \"in the abstract\" are there for a reason: in particular, you will be going down a\nblind alley if you try to imagine some configuration of Stern-Gerlach magnets that would do\nthe job. Finally, you should ignore the fact that, according to standard quantum mechanical\nlore, such an experiment is impossible. (Part of the point of this and the next exercise is to\nshow one important reason for this part of quantum mechanical lore.) Hint: How many\ndistinguishable outcomes would this experiment need to have? What would their\nprobabilities have to be?\n2. Show that, given the quantum mechanical probabilities for the experimental arrangement\ndescribed in handout #2, it is not possible to design an apparatus that simultaneously\nmeasures the spin of particle 1 in both the 0° direction and the +120° direction (i.e., the\nprobabilities that such a joint measurement yields for UP,0° and UP,+120° would have to be\nthe same as those yielded, respectively, by an ordinary 0°-measurement and by an ordinary\n+120°-measurement). You may assume that if you could design such an apparatus, then you\ncould also design an apparatus which simultaneously measures the spin of particle 2 in both\nthe 0° direction and the -120° direction. Hint: It's easy--just think about the derivation of\nBell's Inequalities in handout #2.\n\n3. It is possible to prepare a spin-1/2 particle in a state such that no matter what spin-\nmeasurement is performed on it, Prob(UP) = .5. Give a convincing argument that this state\ncannot be represented by a vector.\n4. Consider a system consisting of two spin-1/2 particles, one in the x-up spin state and the\nother in the x-down spin state (x-up = certain to go up through a 90°-magnet; x-down =\ncertain to go down through a 90°-magnet). Then the state of the system as a whole (well, the\nspin part of that state) can be represented by the vector x+⊗ x-. (The \"⊗\" symbol is for the\ntensor product--what Albert calls a kind of \"vector multiplication\".) Write this vector as a\nlinear combination of the vectors z+⊗z+, z+⊗z-, z-⊗z+, and z-⊗z-. That is, find the\ncoefficients a, b, c, and d in the equation\nx+⊗x- = a z+⊗z+ +b z+⊗z- + c z-⊗z+ + d z-⊗z-.\nIt will help to remember that x+ = 1/√2 (z+ + z-), and x- = 1/√2 (z+ - z-).\n5. Now do the same for the vector x-⊗x+.\n6. Use the results of the last two problems to write the vector 1/√2(x+⊗x- - x-⊗x+) as a linear\ncombination of the vectors z+⊗z+, z+⊗z-, z-⊗z+, and z-⊗z-."

But even at this stage there is\nessentially the question of an influence on the very conditions which\ndefine the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior\nof thesystem.

Then there\nwill be eight possible property configurations, each\nwith a corresponding probability of being\ngenerated:\n\nleft particle\nright particle\nprobability\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np1\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np2\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np3\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np4\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np5\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np6\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np7\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np8\np1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 = 1.\n\nWhat is the probability that the outcomes will be different,\nif the magnet orientations are different?\nA simplified quantum-mechanical derivation:\nConsider just the situation where the left-hand magnet has orientation +120°\nand the right-hand magnet has orientation 0°. Suppose that the right-hand\nparticle goes through its magnet first. Then there are two cases:\nCase 1: It goes up. Then the left-hand particle is certain to go down through a\nmagnet with orientation 0°. So, by the cos-squared law, its probability for\ngoing down through a magnet with orientation +120° is1/4.\nCase 2: It goes down. Then the left-hand particle is certain to go up through a\nmagnet with orientation 0°. So, by the cos-squared law, its probability for\ngoing up through a magnet with orientation +120° is 1/4.\nEither way, the probability of opposite results is 1/4.\n\nWhat probabilities does our hidden-variables hypothesis\nyield?\nFirst case: θleft = +120° and θright = 0°.\nleft particle\nright particle\nprobability\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np1\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np2\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np3\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np4\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np5\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np6\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np7\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np8\nProbability of opposite outcomes = p1 + p2 + p7 + p8\n\nWhat probabilities does our hidden-variables hypothesis\nyield?\nSecond case: θleft = 0° and θright = -120°.\nleft particle\nright particle\nprobability\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np1\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np2\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np3\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np4\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np5\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np6\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np7\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np8\nProbability of opposite outcomes = p2 + p4 + p5 + p7\n\nWhat probabilities does our hidden-variables hypothesis\nyield?\nThird case: θleft = +120° and θright = -120°.\nleft particle\nright particle\nprobability\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np1\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np2\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np3\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np4\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np5\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np6\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np7\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np8\nProbability of opposite outcomes = p2 + p3 + p6 + p7\n\nDISASTER\nSTRIKES!!\nCompare the predictions of quantum mechanics with\nthe predictions of our hidden-variables hypothesis:\nprobability of opposite\noutcomes\nQM\nHV\n+120°\n-120°\n.25\n.25\n.25\np2 + p3 + p6 + p7\np2 + p4 + p5 + p7\np1 + p2 + p7 + p8\nθright\nθleft\n0°\n+120°\n0°\n-120°\nAdd the QM column: The sum is .75.\nAdd the HV column: The sum is p1 + p2 + p7 + p8 + p2 + p4 + p5 + p7 + p2 + p3 + p6 + p7\n= p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 + 2p2 + 2p7 = 1 + 2p2 + 2p7.\nSo HV contradicts QM--and when we run the experiment, QM wins.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nLOGICAL CONNECTIONS:\nExample: Flip a coin many times. Two variables characterize\neach toss: a variable H which has value 1 if the coin lands\nheads, and value 0 if it lands tails; and a variable T which\nhas value 0 if the coin lands heads, and value 1 if it lands\ntails. Observe that these variables are perfectly correlated, in\nthat on each toss, one has value 1 if and only if the other has\nvalue 0!\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nMERE COINCIDENCE:\nExample: Flip one million coins, twenty times each. Since there\nare only slightly over one million sequences of outcomes for\neach coin to exhibit, the probability is very high that at least\ntwo of the coins will land the same way each time--that is,\ntheir outcomes will be perfectly correlated.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nPRE-ESTABLISHED HARMONY:\nPeriodic processes that happen, by chance, to\nhave the same periodicity will be correlated. For\nexample, suppose that there is a species of insect\nthat spawns exactly once every four years--in,\nas it happens, early November. Then there will\nbe a perfect correlation between the behavior of\nthese insects and the presidential elections.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nDIRECT CAUSAL CONNECTION:\nAny time one type of event typically causes\nanother, a correlation will emerge. Smoking and\nlung cancer provide an obvious example: there is\na fairly firmly established correlation between\nsmoking when young and contracting lung\ncancer later in life--presumably because the first\ncauses the second.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nCOMMON CAUSE:\nCorrelations can be explained by a particular kind of\nindirect causal connection: When one type of event\ntypically has two characteristic effects, these effects\nwill be correlated with each other. For example, there\nis a fairly well-established correlation between\nsmoking now and contracting lung cancer now--not\nbecause smoking right now has any chance of\nimmediately giving you lung cancer, but because it is a\nsign that you have smoked a lot previously--which\ndoes have a decent chance of giving you lung cancer.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nFUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL\nLAW:\nConsider atoms. There is a tight correlation between\nthe number of electrons an atom contains and the\naverage energy of these electrons. Our best\nexplanation of this correlation goes (roughly) like this:\nIt is physically impossible for two electrons in an atom\nto occupy the same quantum-mechanical state, and\nwhen lower-energy states get filled up only higher\nenergy states remain."

Then there\nwill be eight possible property configurations, each\nwith a corresponding probability of being\ngenerated:\n\nleft particle\nright particle\nprobability\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\np1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 = 1.\n\nWhat is the probability that the outcomes will be different,\nif the magnet orientations are different?\nA simplified quantum-mechanical derivation:\nConsider just the situation where the left-hand magnet has orientation +120°\nand the right-hand magnet has orientation 0°. Suppose that the right-hand\nparticle goes through its magnet first. Then there are two cases:\nCase 1: It goes up. Then the left-hand particle is certain to go down through a\nmagnet with orientation 0°. So, by the cos-squared law, its probability for\ngoing down through a magnet with orientation +120° is1/4.\nCase 2: It goes down. Then the left-hand particle is certain to go up through a\nmagnet with orientation 0°. So, by the cos-squared law, its probability for\ngoing up through a magnet with orientation +120° is 1/4.\nEither way, the probability of opposite results is 1/4.\n\nWhat probabilities does our hidden-variables hypothesis\nyield?\nFirst case: θleft = +120° and θright = 0°.\nleft particle\nright particle\nprobability\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\np\np\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\np\nProbability of opposite outcomes = p1 + p2 + p7 + p8\n\nWhat probabilities does our hidden-variables hypothesis\nyield?\nSecond case: θleft = 0° and θright = -120°.\nleft particle\nright particle\nprobability\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\np\np\np\np\np\np\nProbability of opposite outcomes = p2 + p4 + p5 + p7\n\nWhat probabilities does our hidden-variables hypothesis\nyield?\nThird case: θleft = +120° and θright = -120°.\nleft particle\nright particle\nprobability\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\n(U, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(U, -120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\np\np\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\np\n(D, 0°),(U, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(U, -120°)\n(D, 0°),(D, +120°)\n(U, 0°),(D, -120°)\np\np\np\nProbability of opposite outcomes = p2 + p3 + p6 + p7\n\nDISASTER\nSTRIKES!!\nCompare the predictions of quantum mechanics with\nthe predictions of our hidden-variables hypothesis:\nprobability of opposite\noutcomes\nQM\nHV\nθright\n0°\n+120°\n0°\n+120°\n-120°\n-120°\n.25\n.25\n.25\np2 + p3 + p6 + p7\np2 + p4 + p5 + p7\np1 + p2 + p7 + p8\nθleft\nAdd the QM column:\nAdd the HV column:\nThe sum is .75.\nThe sum is p1 + p2 + p7 + p8 + p2 + p4 + p5 + p7 + p2 + p3 + p6 + p7\n= p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 + 2p2 + 2p7 = 1 + 2p2 + 2p7.\nSo HV contradicts QM--and when we run the experiment, QM wins.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nLOGICAL CONNECTIONS:\nExample: Flip a coin many times. Two variables characterize\neach toss: a variable H which has value 1 if the coin lands\nheads, and value 0 if it lands tails; and a variable T which\nhas value 0 if the coin lands heads, and value 1 if it lands\ntails. Observe that these variables are perfectly correlated, in\nthat on each toss, one has value 1 if and only if the other has\nvalue 0!\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nMERE COINCIDENCE:\nExample: Flip one million coins, twenty times each. Since there\nare only slightly over one million sequences of outcomes for\neach coin to exhibit, the probability is very high that at least\ntwo of the coins will land the same way each time--that is,\ntheir outcomes will be perfectly correlated.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nPRE-ESTABLISHED HARMONY:\nPeriodic processes that happen, by chance, to\nhave the same periodicity will be correlated. For\nexample, suppose that there is a species of insect\nthat spawns exactly once every four years--in,\nas it happens, early November. Then there will\nbe a perfect correlation between the behavior of\nthese insects and the presidential elections.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nDIRECT CAUSAL CONNECTION:\nAny time one type of event typically causes\nanother, a correlation will emerge. Smoking and\nlung cancer provide an obvious example: there is\na fairly firmly established correlation between\nsmoking when young and contracting lung\ncancer later in life--presumably because the first\ncauses the second.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nCOMMON CAUSE:\nCorrelations can be explained by a particular kind of\nindirect causal connection: When one type of event\ntypically has two characteristic effects, these effects\nwill be correlated with each other. For example, there\nis a fairly well-established correlation between\nsmoking now and contracting lung cancer now--not\nbecause smoking right now has any chance of\nimmediately giving you lung cancer, but because it is a\nsign that you have smoked a lot previously--which\ndoes have a decent chance of giving you lung cancer.\n\nCORRELATIONS EXPLAINED\nBY\nFUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL\nLAW:\nConsider atoms. There is a tight correlation between\nthe number of electrons an atom contains and the\naverage energy of these electrons. Our best\nexplanation of this correlation goes (roughly) like this:\nIt is physically impossible for two electrons in an atom\nto occupy the same quantum-mechanical state, and\nwhen lower-energy states get filled up only higher\nenergy states remain."

Be\ncareful of this word's connotations!!!\n\nSPIN MEASUREMENTS\nFirst approximation (for the spin state of a single particle):\nVector space used to represent states and experiments is R2.\nUnit vectors represent different possible spin states.\nOrthogonal axes represent different possible experiments.\nOne axis corresponds to the \"up\" outcome and the other to the \"down\" outcome.\nRepresents spin\nstate of particle\ncertain to go up\nthrough 90°\nRepresents \"up\"\noutcome of 0°\nexperiment\nRepresents \"down\"\noutcome of 0°\nexperiment\nExample:\n\nTHE STATISTICAL\nALGORITHM\nUP, 0°\nTo calculate Prob(UP) for 0° experiment:\n45°\nDOWN, 0°\nProject the state-vector onto the \"UP, 0°\" axis;\nSquare the length of this projection.\nAnswer: cos2(45°) = 1/2.\nTo calculate Prob(DOWN) for 0° experiment:\nProject the state-vector onto the \"DOWN, 0°\" axis;\nSquare the length of this projection.\nAnswer: sin2(45°) = 1/2.\nPythagoras' theorem guarantees that these probabilities will sum to 1.\n\nCAUTIOUS\nINSTRUMENTALISM\nWe will, for the time being, adopt a cautiously instrumentalist\napproach to this way of representing physical states. That is,\nall we take it to \"mean\", when we say that the spin state of a\nparticle is represented by such-and-such a vector, is that this\nvector can be \"plugged into\" the statistical algorithm so as to\nyield the correct probabilities for outcomes of spin\nmeasurements performed on that particle.\n\nDERIVING THE COS2 LAW\nIf a particle is certain to go up\nthrough a magnet with orientation θ1,\nthen its probability for going up\nthrough a magnet with orientation θ2\nis\nCOS\n2 θ1 -θ2\n⎛\n⎝\n⎞\n⎠\n\nDERIVING THE COS2 LAW\nIf Prob(UP,θ1) = 1, then Prob(UP,θ2) = f(θ1,θ2).\nAssumptions:\n1. f depends only on the angle difference |θ1 - θ2|.\n2. f is the same with UP replaced by DOWN.\n3. f(0) = 1 (of course); f(π) = 0.\n4. f is monotonically decreasing.\n5. f is continuous.\n6. The values of f are determined in accordance with\nthe statistical algorithm.\n\nFIRST STEP:\nIf Prob(UP,θ1) = 1, then Prob(UP,θ2) = f(θ1,θ2).\nSuppose Prob(UP,0) = 1.\nThen Prob(UP,π) = 0.\n(by assumptions 1&3)\nSo Prob(DOWN,π) = 1.\n(either DOWN or UP must happen)\nAnd Prob(UP,θ) = f(θ).\n(by 1)\nAnd Prob(DOWN,θ) = f(π - θ).\n(by 1 and 2)\nBut Prob(UP,θ) + Prob(DOWN,θ) = 1.\n1. f depends only on |θ1 - θ2|.\n2. f is the same with UP replaced by DOWN.\n3. f(0) = 1; f(π) = 0.\n4. f is monotonically decreasing.\n5. f is continuous.\n∴f(π - θ) = 1 - f(θ).\n∴f(π/2) = 1/2.\n\nWHAT THIS SHOWS:\nAssumptions 1 - 5 constrain f only this much:\nf must be a continuous, monotonically decreasing\nfunction with the values f(0) = 1, f(π/2) = 1/2,\nf(π) = 0; and f(π - θ) = 1 - f(θ).\nf(θ)\n1/2\nπ/2\nπ\nθ\n\nADDING ASSUMPTION 6:\nFirst, we arbitrarily choose\nan axis to represent the\nUP,0 outcome...\n...and an axis to represent\nthe DOWN,0 outcome.\nNote that the DOWN,0\naxis is the same as the\nUP,π axis.\nUP,0\nDOWN,0 (= UP,π)\n\nADDING ASSUMPTION 6:\nNext, we observe that the\nUP,π/2 state-vector must\nbisect these axes:\nUP,0\nDOWN,0 (= UP,π)\nUP,π/2 state-vector\n45°\nNotice that the angle it\nmakes to the UP,0 axis is\nπ/4.\n\nADDING ASSUMPTION 6:\nNext, we observe that the\nUP,π/4 axis must be\nchosen in such a way that\nthe UP,0 and UP,π/2 state-\nvectors have projections\nonto it of equal length.\nThere are two such axes:\nUP,π/2 state-vector\nUP,0 state-vector\n\nADDING ASSUMPTION 6:\nBut the second choice is\nruled out by the\nrequirement that f be\nmonotonically decreasing;\nfor this choice gives us\nf(π/4) < 1/2.\nUP,π/2 state-vector\nUP,0 state-vector\n\nADDING ASSUMPTION 6:\nSo we have now fixed the\nUP,0, UP,π/4, UP,π/2, and\nUP,π state-vectors (and\nlikewise the UP and\nDOWN axes for these\nfour directions).\nUP,π/2 state-vector\nUP,0 state-vector\nUP,π state-vector\nUP,π/4 state-vector\n22.5°\nFor these directions, the\nstatistical algorithm yields\nProb(UP,θ) = cos2(θ/2).\n\nADDING ASSUMPTION 6:\nUP,π/2\nUP,0\nUP,π\nUP,π/4\nThe very same reasoning can now be\napplied to the directions\nθ = 3π/4\nθ = π/8\nθ = 3π/8\n...etc. For each θ = kπ/2n, the\nUP,θ state-vector lies at an angle\nof θ/2 to the UP,0 axis; hence f(θ)\n= cos2(θ/2). Since f is continuous,\nit follows that for every θ, f(θ) =\ncos2(θ/2)--i.e., we have derived\nthe cos2-law.\nθ = 5π/8\nUP,π/8\nUP,3π/8\nUP,5π/8\nUP,7π/8\nUP,3π/4\nθ = 7π/8\n\nGETTING FANCIER:\nCOMPLEX NUMBERS\nIt is in fact possible to measure the spin of a particle in any direction--\nnot just directions confined to the x-z plane. So there is, for example, a\npossible spin state in which the particle is certain to go UP if spin along\nthe y-direction is measured.\nFor such a particle, Prob(UP,x) = 1/2 = Prob(UP,z). What is its\nstate-vector?\nUP,z state-vector\nUP,x state-vector\nWhere can the UP,y\nstate-vector fit?\n\nGETTING FANCIER:\nCOMPLEX NUMBERS\nAnswer: It can't. In order to represent the spin state of such\na particle, we need to employ not the vector space R2 (the\nvector space of pairs of real numbers), but the vector space\nC2 (the vector space of pairs of complex numbers).\nWe will mostly ignore this complication\nthroughout the course."
