  "course_name": "Wheelchair Design in Developing Countries",
  "course_description": "According to the United States Agency for International Development, 20 million people in developing countries require wheelchairs, and the United Nations Development Programme estimates below 1% of their need is being met in Africa by local production. Wheelchair Design in Developing Countries (WDDC) gives students the chance to better the lives of others by improving wheelchairs and tricycles made in the developing world. Lectures will focus on understanding local factors, such as operating environments, social stigmas against the disabled, and manufacturing constraints, and then applying sound scientific/engineering knowledge to develop appropriate technical solutions. Multidisciplinary student teams will conduct term-long projects on topics such as hardware design, manufacturing optimization, biomechanics modeling, and business plan development. Theory will further be connected to real-world implementation during guest lectures by MIT faculty, Third-World community partners, and U.S. wheelchair organizations.\nThis class is made possible by an MIT Alumni Sponsored Funding Opportunities grant with additional support from the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (now VentureWell), the MIT Public Service Center, and the MIT Edgerton Center; special thanks to CustomInk.com.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nLab: 2 hours / week, as arranged by groups\n\nPeople\n\nCourse Instructors:\n\nAmos Winter, V\n\nAmy Smith\n\nLab Instructors:\n\nMario Bollini\n\nForrest Funnel\n\nGwyn Jones\n\nHarry O'Hanley\n\nDebbie Schapira\n\nTish Scolnik\n\nTeam Mentors:\n\nJoost Bonsen -- developmental entrepreneurship expert\n\nRalf Hotchkiss -- developing countries wheelchair expert\n\nRory McCarthy -- handcycle specialist, builder and racer\n\nAaron Wheeler -- wheelchair designer and appropriate technology specialist\n\nWDDC Partners\n\nCourse Structure\n\nThe course units are broken into 2-2-5 corresponding to hours per week of Lecture-Lab-Homework.\n\nLecture\n\nEach student is required to attend the lectures but is allowed to miss two during the semester. More than two absences without permission from one of the instructors will result in failing the course.\n\nLab\n\nEach project team will choose its own lab time. The team needs to schedule two hours a week to meet with their lab instructor. The lab session is an important time to develop your project and get advice from you lab instructor. Set aside the same time every week to meet in order to insure everyone can attend.\n\nHomework\n\nHomework will consist primarily of readings and short assignments to be handed in. Assignments will be due one week after being assigned. As the semester progresses less homework will be given to allow more time for the project.\n\nGrading\n\nThe course will be graded from A-F. Lab instructors will assign grades for all students in their section. Instructors will collaborate to ensure that there is equitable grading between lab sections. Half of the total grade is based on individual work and the other half is based on teamwork. Class and lab participation grades are based on both attendance and quality of in-class activity.\n\nThe grading breakdown is:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass participation/homework\n\n10%\n\nStrategy presentation\n\n15%\n\nConcept presentation\n\n15%\n\nMost critical module (MCM) presentation\n\n15%\n\nFinal presentation and prototype\n\n25%\n\nTeam Web site\n\n20%\n\nEach teams' progress will be judged largely on presentations given at each project milestone.\n\nTerm Project\n\nStudents will form into lab groups, 3 to 5 members plus a lab instructor, to work on a project (either from the Web site or proposed by a student) for the term. While participating in the project, each group will have the following responsibilities:\n\nCollaboration\n\nThe project is meant to be a true collaboration between MIT students, experts who work in each project field, and local wheelchair technicians in developing countries. Each team is required to send a\nweekly update email to both the project mentors and local partners\nto demonstrate their progress and obtain feedback/ideas. Mentors and local partners will be assigned to project teams after the teams have been formed.\n\nGroup meetings\n\nEach project group is required to meet once a week for two hours with their lab instructor. It is up to the group and lab instructor to choose the best meeting time for all, which does not have to be the scheduled class lab time. The group is encouraged to pick a time that overlaps with open hours of facilities that might be useful to the project (e.g. the Hobby Shop, Edgerton Shop, Foundry, etc).\n\nDeliverables\n\nEach group will need to produce the following deliverables:\n\nA PowerPoint presentation for the Strategy, Concept, MCM, and Final presentation milestones.\n\nA poster and presentation to be presented at the MIT museum in Lec #26. The poster and presentation should summarize the team's work. Teams should also strive to have a prototype finished to show visitors of the museum.\n\nPrototypes: A physical solution to each teams' MCM will be presented at the MCM presentation. For the final presentation, a functioning proof-of-concept prototype is expected. For example, if a team designs a new wheelchair frame, a fully-functioning device that demonstrates all the important features of the design and the manufacturability of the product is expected. The final project does not have to be a polished, refined product, but should be usable. For teams doing business plans or other projects that do not require hardware, a solution to the biggest obstacle of the project is expected at the MCM presentation, and a full plan of how to implement the group's work into a local partner workshop is expected at the final presentation. The final project should be developed to a point where it can be brought to the developing world and quickly made into a fully functioning prototype for further testing.\n\nTeam Web Sites\n\nEach team is required to make a Web site defining their project, introducing the team members, and chronicling the development of each milestone. The purpose of this requirement is to make all of the technology from WDDC opensource for the rest of the world. A Web site update will be due at each project milestone. Summer fellows that continue WDDC projects will be required to update the Web site corresponding to their project with their summer work. Teams' Web sites will be posted on the\nMIT Mobility Lab Web site\n.\n\nResources\n\nMonetary\n\nThe class has a materials budget of approx. $4000. Teams will not have a fixed budget, as some teams will have to buy more things than others. Anything that costs more than $100 should be cleared with the instructor. If you would like to purchase an item you can either:\n\nTell Amos where to buy it\n\nBuy it yourself and submit your receipt for reimbursement\n\nManufacturing\n\nThe following manufacturing facilities will be accessible to WDDC students for their group projects:\n\nM-Lab/D-Lab workshop: This shop has many general prototyping tools and materials. It also has many materials found in developing countries. Dennis has a lot of experience with appropriate technology. This shop will be available 24/7 on the conditions that people only use tools on which they are trained and that they work with a partner.\n\nThe Edgerton Shop: This shop is good for machining and cutting metal parts.\n\nThe Hobby Shop: This shop is good for woodworking and has a waterjet.\n\nThe MIT Foundry: This shop is where to go to get things welded and learn to weld.\n\nParts\n\nWDDC has multiple locally-made wheelchairs and handcycles that teams can use. Teams should not destroy any of these devises, but are welcome to modify or use parts from them. If a team would like to make a \"permanent modification\" to one of these devices, ask an instructor first. Also, M-Lab has tons of bicycle parts from developing countries around the world that can be use for prototyping.\n\nPeople\n\nUtilize your Mentors, Community Partners, and Lab Instructors to the fullest. They have a wealth of knowledge in your project area and will greatly broaden the skill set of your team.\n\nFellowships\n\nWDDC has funding to support students for Summer 2009 to implement technology generated in the class into partner wheelchair workshops. More fellowships through the\nMIT Public Service Center\nmay be available depending on the strength of each student's application. Those who would like a fellowship will have to propose a project (most likely a continuation of their class project) within the guidelines of one of the PSC fellowships (Independent, Network, or Focus). To be fair to all interested students, proposals will be submitted to, judged by, and awarded through the PSC. Alison Hynd, coordinator for the fellowships and the IDEAS competition, will be coming to class to talk about all funding opportunities to continue work from WDDC.\n\nCalendar\n\nLEC #\n\nTOPICS\n\nPROJECT MILESTONES\n\nIntroduction to wheelchairs in developing countries\n\nReview potential projects\n\nWheelchair/Trike relay race around campus\n\n2008 summer fellow presentations on last year's projects\n\nGuest speaker: Alison Hynd, MIT Public Service Center, on summer fellowships\n\nDesigning wheelchairs for the developing world\n\nDeterministic design process\n\nChoose project teams\n\nGuest Speaker: Joost Bonsen on developmental entrepreneurship\n\nHold first lab meeting\n\nContact team mentors and community partners\n\nGuest speakers: Abdullah Munish and Fatuma Acan\n\nDefine functional requirements\n\nStrategy presentations\n\nStrategy presentations due\n\nGuest speaker: Amy Smith and Amy Banzaert - Appropriate technology, idea to product, successfully implementing technologies\n\nDiscussion of appropriate and inappropriate technologies\n\nWheelchair role-play\n\n\"Power of Persons with Disabilities, Advocacy and the Challenges\" Guest talk by Maryan Amaral, Aero Inc.\n\nResults from Tanzanian Wheelchair Foundation Study\n\nWheelchair Biomechanics/Ergonomics and design for human use\n\nPower output test up ramp in basement\n\nManufacturing processes and strategies\n\nConcept presentations\n\nProduct design and critique of existing wheelchair designs\n\nMaterial science/mechanics of materials/welding with Mike Tarkanian\n\nMaterial science/mechanics of materials/welding with Mike Tarkanian\n\nWatch \"Murderball\" in class\n\nAccelerate project work outside of class\n\nFinish \"Murderball\" and watch parts of \"Emanuel's Gift\"\n\nGuest speaker: Ralf Hotchkiss, on his career and designing wheelchairs\n\nMost critical module (MCM) presentations\n\nMaterial properties and performance\n\nGuest Speaker: Prof. David Gordon Wilson on human-powered machines\n\nReview wheelchair designs and how they contribute to body image\n\nGuest Speaker: Rory McCarthy on handcycle design and racing\n\nProject work\n\nProject work (cont.)\n\nProject work (cont.)\n\nProject work (cont.)\n\nPoster and presentation for MIT museum\n\nProject work (cont.)\n\nFinal presentation session\n\nFinal presentation of project with a working prototype",

(UNESCO Bangkok)\n- About 600 million people in the world experience disabilities of\nvarious types. 80% of the world's disabled people live in low-\nincome countries; the majority of them are poor and do not have\naccess to basic services including rehabilitation facilities. (World\nHealth Organization)\n- Between 20 and 50 million people globally are estimated to be\ninjured or disabled in road traffic accidents each year. (World\nHealth Organization, 2004)\n- Close to ten million severely or moderately disabled people are\nadded each year to the total global figure - or about 25,000 every\nday. (Helander, 1999)\n- 70% of disabled people in developing countries are estimated\nto live in rural areas (Groce, 1999)\n(Statistics provided by Motivation UK)\nFebruary 3, 2009\n\nMOTIVATION\nNeed for wheelchairs\n- The WHO and Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO),\nestimate that only 1-3% of people with disabilities in the\nSouth who require rehab services have access to them.\n(Helander, 1999)\n- Most people who sustain a spinal cord injury in the South\ndie within two years, compared to a normal life expectancy\nin the North. (Werner, 1998)\n- Conservative estimates put the number of people with\ndisabilities in developing countries at close to half a billion.\nOf these, an estimated 20 million require wheelchairs to\nbe mobile. (United States Agency for International\nDevelopment, 2003)\n- An estimated 95% of people who need a wheelchair don't\nhave one. (Werner, 1998)\n- Below 1% of the need for wheelchairs in Africa is being\nmet through local production. (United Nations\nDevelopment Project, 2002)\n(Statistics provided by Motivation UK)\nFebruary 3, 2009\n\n- Disability is both a cause and a consequence of poverty.\nEliminating world poverty is unlikely to be achieved unless the rights\nand needs of people with disabilities is taken into account. (UK\nDepartment of International Development)\n- In Tanzania, households with disabled members are 20% more\nlikely to be living in poverty. (UK Department of International\nDevelopment, 2005)\n- \"98% of children with disabilities in developing countries do not\nattend school.\" Earlier studies by UNESCAP and UNICEF show\nthat this deplorable condition also applies to the Asia-Pacific region,\nwhere only around 2% of children with disabilities - one in every fifty\nchildren - have access to education of any sort. (UNESCO\nBangkok)\nMOTIVATION\nConsequences due to lack of mobility\n- Worldwide, only 2% of disabled children get any schooling.\n(Action on Disability and Development, 2006)\n- Men, women and children who are discriminated against often\nend up excluded from society, the economy and political\nparticipation. They are more likely to be poor. (UK Department of\nInternational Development, 2005)\n- Women and girls with disabilities face double discrimination\nbased on disability and gender. As a group, they fare far worse\nthan nondisabled women or disabled men on most indicators of\nfinancial, educational and vocational success.\" (Mobility International\nUSA, 2002)\n(Statistics provided by Motivation UK)\nFebruary 3, 2009\n\nROLE OF MIT IN DEVELOPING WHEELHCAIR TECHNOLOGY\nWhat MIT can offer\n- Enthusiastic, creative students who\nare excellent engineers and work for\nFREE\n- Resources, facilities, manpower to\npursue high risk/high payoff projects\nthat workshops or NGOs may not\notherwise be able to develop\n- A fresh perspective on wheelchair\nproblems; new students ever year\n- Opportunities for cross-cultural,\ncollaborative exchange of ideas\n- World-wide recognition of MIT draws\nattention to wheelchair issues\nFebruary 3, 2009\n\nGoal: By partnering with expert organizations, MIT can aid in making\nBETTER TECHNOLOGY THROUGH COLLABORATION\ngreat improvements to mobility technology in developing countries\nInnovation\nMIT\n- Next generation of great\ntechnical minds\n- Excellent facilities/resources\n- Strength of MIT reputation\n- Specialize in sound\nengineering and innovation\n- Students work for free\nLocal knowledge\nExperience\nExample: Mobility Care\nExample: Whirlwind\n- Best understanding of\n- 30+ years designing\ncommunity\nwheelchairs\n- Working directly with\n- Experts in wheelchair\nwheelchair users\nrequirements for\n- Knowledge of local factors:\ndeveloping countries\nparts/materials, labor skill,\n- World-wide workshop\ncultural stigmas, terrain\nnetwork\nFebruary 3, 2009\nCourtesy of Whirlwind Wheelchair\nInternational.

Winter, V\nPhD Student, Department of Mechanical Engineering\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nCambridge, MA 02139\nAbstract - The purpose of this assessment was to determine the current state of wheelchair\ntechnology in Tanzania and the factors that prevent Tanzania's disabled from utilizing\nwheelchair technology. Ninety-nine interviews of wheelchair and tricycle users, wheelchair\nand tricycle manufacturers, and advocacy groups for the disabled were conducted\nthroughout Tanzania during the summer of 2005. Technical issues identified included:\ntricycles are more popular and much less expensive than wheelchairs; most disabled people\nrely on donations to buy a mobility aid; production costs can be decreased by using bicycle\ncomponents and outsourcing tasks; bicycle components are available in rural areas and are\nattractive for use in wheelchairs; and donated wheelchairs are often irresponsibly\ndistributed and poorly designed for their operating environment. The assessment was\nconducted under the supervision of the Tanzania Training Center for Orthopedic\nTechnologists and Whirlwind Wheelchair International.\nIndex Terms - developing countries, disability, handcycle, mobility aid, tricycle, wheelchair\nINTRODUCTION\nPeople with physical disabilities in developing countries face many challenges integrating into\neveryday life. If these people cannot obtain a wheelchair they are sometimes forced to stay\ntrapped in their home or use crawling as their only means of transportation. Disability KaRi,\nwhich is helping to oversee wheelchair projects in developing countries, reports that only 2% of\npeople in Africa who need a wheelchair actually have one. The Tanzania Association of the\nDisabled (CHAWATA) estimates there are 30,000 people who need wheelchairs in Tanzania and\nonly 2,000 who have one.ii Immobility adversely affects the lives of disabled people by, for\nexample, making it near impossible to attend school, participate in the community, or earn an\nincome. The terrain in developing countries can further impede integration into society; in urban\nenvironments doorways and bathrooms are typically not handicapped accessible, and in rural\nsettings roadway quality can be hilly, rough, and muddy.\nEfforts have been made in Tanzania to improve wheelchair technology, fabrication, and the\nchannels through which wheelchairs are distributed. The Wheelchair Technologists Training\nCourse (WTTC) at the Training Center for Orthopedic Technologists (TATCOT)iii in Moshi,\ndeveloped in part by the NGO Motivation, iv is a one-year course for a Certificate for Wheelchair\nTechnologists. The WTTC covers manufacturing and fitting of wheelchairs designed for African\ncountries, which can be produced in small-scale, self-sustained shops. Whirlwind Wheelchair\nInternational (WWI)v, a US-based non-profit NGO that develops appropriate wheelchair\ntechnology for developing countries, has helped establish 21 wheelchair manufacturing shops\naround the world. One of the wheelchair designs taught in the WTTC is based on a WWI model.\nAlthough chairs are being produced in Tanzania, most people only have accessibility to\nimports that are poorly made, improperly fitted, and dangerous to the user. Wheelchairs need to\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nbe fitted with the consideration of the user's size, age, and nature of disability, among other\nfactors. If improperly fitted, the chair can cause pressure sores - breaks in the skin produced by a\nperson's weight pressing against an unyielding surface. These sores can develop almost\nimmediately upon contact. If left untreated they can become infected and lead to death.\nThe purpose of this assessment is to elucidate the factors in current wheelchair design,\nmanufacturing, distribution, and use that are prohibiting Tanzanian wheelchair users from\naccessing and utilizing appropriate wheelchair technology. Such factors can be in the form of\ntechnological inadequacies for the operating environment, inefficient manufacturing practices,\nlack of competitive pricing, ineffective or limited cost subsidizing, inefficient distribution\npractices, etc.\nThis document summarizes the findings of the full report written on the assessment, which is\navailable for downloadvi. The assessment was supervised by TATCOT and WWI and was meant\nto provide feedback to both organizations to aid in future wheelchair planning strategies in\nTanzania. To the knowledge of the author, TATCOT, and WWI, such an assessment has never\nbeen conducted in Tanzania. Written permission was granted from each interviewee before\ninterviews were conducted.\nASSESSMENT STRATEGY\nInterview Content\nThe aim of this assessment was to inspect the current state of wheelchair technology from\nmultiple angles by interviewing the primary parties involved with wheelchair design,\nmanufacturing, and use. Three types of questionnaires were developed by the author, in\nconjunction with TATCOT and WWI, to interview individual wheelchair users, wheelchair\nadvocacy groups, and wheelchair manufacturers. In this paper the terms \"wheelchair\" and\n\"tricycle\" are both used to describe types of mobility aids. Common examples of these machines\nare shown in Figure 1.\nA) WHEELCHAIR\nB) TRICYCLE\nFIGURE 1\nCOMMON MOBILITY AIDS\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nA short content summary of each party's questionnaire is below. Full versions of the\nquestionnaires can be found in the original reportvii.\n- Individual wheelchair/tricycle users: How was the wheelchair/tricycle obtained; who\npaid for the wheelchair/tricycle, who made the wheelchair/tricycle; at what age was the\nwheelchair/tricycle obtained; what type of mobility is the wheelchair/tricycle used for -\nshort or long travel; how functional is the wheelchair/tricycle in the users life; what types\nof technical problems are encountered; what caused the disability; at what age was the\nfirst and current wheelchair/tricycle obtained.\n- Advocacy groups: What services are provide to wheelchair/tricycle users; does the\norganization purchase wheelchairs/tricycles; are they donated to the org - and if so by\nwhom; does the org have a need-based subsidizing plan; how many people are in the org;\nhow many wheelchairs/tricycles have been distributed; are there any technical problems\nobserved with the members' chairs.\n- Manufacturers: What types of wheelchairs/tricycles are produced; how much does each\ncost; what types of components are being used; what types of raw material is used; how\nquickly are products produced; what types of manufacturing strategies are in use; how\nmany people are employed.\nInterview Locations\nInterview locations were chosen in an effort to represent both urban and rural wheelchair\noperating environments. The primary interview locations were Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Arusha,\nand Stone Town, Zanzibar. Visiting remote villages and interviewing disabled was logistically\nimpossible. Advocacy groups working in rural areas provided most of the information about\nrural wheelchair use. Some rural information was contributed by urban interviewees who had\nlived much of their life in a village. The majority of interviews were conducted in the Dar es\nSalaam area because it has the highest population density and concentration of wheelchair\nrelated organizations in the country.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF WHEELCHAIR USER INTERVIEWS\nThe following section presents critical results from wheelchair user interviews and provides\ndiscussion on issues the data reveals. The full compilation of data from the assessment can be\nfound in the original reportviii. In all, seventy-one disabled people were interviewed in the\nassessment.\nCauses of Disability\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of disability causes for the interviewees. Polio was the most\ncommon disability observed, at 38% of the interview population. Most polio survivors\ninterviewed contracted the virus early in life.\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nBirth Defect\nPolio\nSpinal Injury Cerebral Palsy\nOther\nN/A\nCause of disability\n# of interviewees\nFIGURE 2\nDISTRIBUTION OF INTERVIEWEE DISABILITIES\nIt is important to note that only people who were available or visible to the author were\ninterviewed. Survivors of birth defects and polio made up 54% of the interviewees. In\ncomparison to the spinally injured, who typically became disabled later in life (~20 years old),\nbirth defect and polio survivors had more time to acclimate to their disability by learning to\ncrawl or use a mobility aid. Thus, the people who were able to work or beg on the street were\nprimarily polio or birth defect survivors and represent a larger portion of the interviewees.\nPre-wheelchair Mobility\nAs a result of the majority of interviewees becoming disabled early in life, most used crawling as\ntheir primary form of mobility before obtaining a wheelchair or tricycle. This trend is seen in\nFigure 3, with 49% of the interviewees relying on crawling before obtaining their current\nmobility aid.\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nCrawling\nCane\nCrutches\nPush Cart\nOther\nN/A\nMeans of transportation before current WC/trike\n# of interviewees\nFIGURE 3\nMEANS OF TRAVEL BEFORE CURRENT MOBILITY AID\nFigure 4 demonstrates how long people wait before receiving a mobility aid. The average\ninterviewee age of obtaining a first wheelchair or tricycle was 22 years old. As a result, most\npeople who went to school or had a job before the age of 22 were forced to crawl as a primary\nmeans of travel, while others were simply unable to attend school or obtain a job because of\ndistance.\n0-9\n10-19\n20-29\n30-39\n40-49\n50+\nN/A\nAge when received first WC/trike\n# of interviewees\nFIGURE 4\nAGE WHEN FIRST MOBILITY AID OBTAINED\nUsage after Obtaining a Wheelchair or Tricycle\nFigure 5 and Figure 6 indicate why tricycles are the preferred mobility aid. Most of the\ninterviewees needed to travel multiple kilometers per day, with 36% traveling more than 5km\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nand many more traveling over 1km. For long distances, a tricycle requires much less energy than\na wheelchair. Although Figure 6 shows only slightly more tricycle users than wheelchair users, it\nis important to note that the author had to make a concerted effort to find wheelchair users, but\nhad to forgo many interviews with tricycle users. On the street, it was much more common to see\na tricycle user. Wheelchair users were only interviewed in hospitals, schools, and rehabilitation\ncenters - places that required small distances of movement per day. During the duration of the\nassessment not a single wheelchair user was seen outside an enclosed facility or organization.\n0 to 4km\n5 to 9km\n10 to 14km\n15 to 19km\n=20km\nN/A\nDistance traveled to work/school\n# of interviewees\nFIGURE 5\nDAILY TRAVEL DISTANCE OF INTERVIEWEES\nBus\nTaxi\nWC\nTrike\nFriend\nCrawl\nN/A\nPrimary means of mobility\n# of interviewees\nFIGURE 6\nMEANS OF TRANSPORTATION USED\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nThe preference of tricycles by Tanzanian disabled can be further explained by comparing Figure\n5 and Figure 6 with Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 4 shows that most people interviewed did not\nget a mobility aid until later in life (mean age of 22), and Figure 3 shows many had been forced\nto crawl small distances. As a result, there is a greater need for many disabled to travel long\ndistances using a mobility aid, such as going from home to work. Since many of the interviewees\nwere capable of crawling short distances, they were willing to forgo the short-range mobility\noffered by a wheelchair for the multiple-kilometer capabilities of a tricycle. Furthermore, local\nbusses rarely permit disabled people to ride; many interviewees commented on being turned\naway when trying to ride a bus. The author used city busses as his primary mode of\ntransportation throughout the study and did not once see a wheelchair or tricycle user as a\npassenger.\nImported wheelchairs were much more common than ones made in-country, with 73% of\nwheelchair users having a chair made abroad. Only two interviewees used Tanzania-made\nwheelchairs as their primary mobility aid. The majority of imported wheelchairs observed came\nfrom the Wheelchair Foundationix, which has given thousands of chairs to Tanzania over the past\ndecade.\nWheelchair and Tricycle Purchasing\nA problem observed during the assessment was the inability of people to purchase their own\nmobility aid. Figure 7 shows the distribution of income of the interviewees. The average monthly\nincome was $49US, which is twice Tanzania's national average income of $24 per month. x This\ndiscrepancy can be attributed to the following factors: 1) People with jobs were easier to find and\ninterview; 2) Most of the interviews were conducted in urban areas where there are more formal\nand informal income-generating opportunities and higher average incomes; 3) Only 35% of the\nnational population is urbanized.xi\n$0US\n$0 to 29US\n$30 to 59US\n$60 to 89US\n$90 to 119US $120 to 149US\n=150US\nStudent\nN/A\nMonthly income\n# of interviewees\nFIGURE 7\nINCOME OF INTERVIEWEES\nFigure 8 shows the large price gap between the cost of a new mobility aid and what users can\nafford.

This leaves approximately a $100US gap\nbetween what people can afford and what mobility aids cost. The majority of interviewees, 78%,\ndid not contribute any money towards their current mobility aid.

In the category of \"Other,\" 14 of the 17 responses were\nfrom children at the Salvation Army Rehabilitation Centerxii who get their wheelchairs repaired\nat the on-site workshop. The majority of those children said they have their chairs repaired at\nbicycle shops when they are at home. The most common complaint about foreign wheelchairs\nwas that spare parts are not available.

This most\nlikely contributes to the greater popularity of tricycles over wheelchairs in Tanzania. In order to\nbe competitive, Tanzanian wheelchair manufacturers should lower their prices to the level of\ntricycles and imported chairs. Price reduction is possible, considering the UWZ workshop is able\nto sell a wheelchair for $140US that is essentially identical to the Mobility Care 4-wheeler sold\nat $250.\nUpon inspection of tricycle manufacturing facilities, the following factors were observed to\ncontribute to low production costs.\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\n- Minimized individual part production: Palray produces only the frames of the tricycles\nthey build. All other parts are purchased. This practice greatly decreases production time\nand the variety of tasks workers are required to complete.\n- Maximum usage of bicycle parts: Other than the frames, all other parts in a Palray\ntricycle are from bicycles. Many of the parts are produced in China at a much lower cost\nthan what they could be made for in Tanzania.\n- Assembly line production: All of the tricycle shops used an assembly line, with dedicated\npeople in charge of one or only a few production steps. The work is more repetitive in an\nassembly line, but time for switching setups and tasks is reduced.\n- Incentive-based payment: Jaffery uses commission based salary to promote competition\nbetween employees producing the same parts, increasing productivity.\nInadequate Mechanical Design\nThis section discusses mechanical design problems that prohibit wheelchairs and tricycles being\nproduced in Tanzania from performing adequately.\nAxle Bending\nThe axles used in the WTTC 4-wheeler are too weak. There are loading conditions where the\naxle might bend, one of which is represented by Figure 11 where the full load of the user is\nexerted on one of the rear wheels while the chair is tipping. A situation where this loading\ncondition could occur is when a friend is pushing a wheelchair user off a curb on the rear wheels\nand one wheel drops before the other. The dimensions in Figure 11 were taken from a WTTC 4-\nwheeler and the load is a 670N (150lbs) person.\nLoad = 670N\n? = tipping\nangle\nFReaction\nFrame\nAxle\n(la = 17mm,\nda = 16.4mm)\nWheel\n(dw = 660mm)\nLength to\nchair center\n(lf = 203mm)\nFIGURE 11\nTIPPING OF WTTC 4-WHEELER\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nThe bending stress on the axle is a function of the load and tipping angle, and is expressed in\nEquation 1.\ns = 1.55N\n3 [(330mm)sin q - (52mm)cos q]\nEQUATION 1\nmm\nThe tip-over point of the chair is approximately 31 degrees, where the center of mass is vertically\naligned ove r the reaction point of the wheel and the ground. If the frame is made of mild steel,\nwith a yield stress of 330N/mm2, the max bending stress at that angle is 59% of the yield strength\nof the steel. Note that this analysis is static. If a chair were to drop off a curb only a few inches,\nthe shock load could be multiple times greater and cause the axle to yield. One should also\nconsider that the highest stress occurs at the point where the axle is welded to the frame, where\nthe material will be weaker due to the weldment.\nWeakness of X-brace Center Pivot\nA number of workshops reported that the holes that hold the bolt for the center pivot of the X-\nbrace would quickly wear out and open up, decreasing the rigidity of the brace. The widening of\nthe brace hole is the result of high torques being exerted on the pivot pin when the chair is on 3\nwheels, such as when rolling over rough ground. A 4-wheeled chair is probably not the best\nsolution for very bumpy operating environments. Unless the frame has a lot of compliance or\nslack in the joints, only 3 wheels will touch the ground.\nForces from reaction\nwith ground\nProjection\nof X-pivot\nReaction\ntorque\nthrough X-\npivot bolt\nFIGURE 12\nPROJECTION OF MOMENTS IN X-BRACE OF WTTC 4-WHEELER\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nSome of the manufacturers said that fixed-frame 3-wheeled chairs are preferred by people who\nhave to travel on rough terrain, as the chair is always kinematically constrained with the ground.\nOne of these manufacturers said that the 4-wheeled WTTC chair is primarily sold to hospitals,\nwhere the ground is even and flat. This is unfortunate, as the WTTC 4-wheeler was originally\nintended for rough terrain.\nTricycle Frame Weakness\nMany of the tricycles observed had bent frames, or had frames that had been bent in the past and\nsince repaired. The frame weakness is the result of designing the second moment of area too low\nin the center of the frame. This problem was observed in the Palray, Jaffery, and DAGE frames.\nA bucked frame and corresponding moment within the frame are shown in Figure 13. Bending\nstress is proportional to the applied moment, the distance from the neutral axis, and the inverse of\nthe second moment of area. Thus the highest stress occurs at center of all the Tanzanian tricycle\nframes.\nFrame weakness\nFReaction\nFReaction\nCenter of\ngravity\nPosition along chair\nMoment\nPosition along chair\nMax Moment\nFIGURE 13\nBUCKLED FRAME OF A PALRAY TRICYCLE AND CORRESPONDING BENDING MOMENT\nInefficient Gearing in Tricycles\nMany tricycle users observed traveling seemed to be working much harder than necessary, and\nduring interviews many said that pedaling caused pain in their chest muscles. After riding a\ntricycle and experiencing the difficulties first hand, it was clear that the gear ratio was not well\nmatched for human force and power capabilities. Figure 14 shows the gear ratio schematics of\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\ntwo tricycle designs, with each critical element characterized by its diameter.

Over-\nconstraining the bearings can greatly decrease their life by inducing high stresses on the balls and\nraces. In Figure 15B one can imagine that if the bearing spacer is too short, the inner race will\nnot hit the spacer. The preload force from the nut will then be transferred through the bearing\nballs into the outer race. If the nut is tightened further, increasing the preload force, the balls and\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nraces will be sheared, damaging the bearings. Radial bearings are not designed to take high axial\nloads. If the bearing spacer is too long then the bearings will be under-constrained, allowing the\nfork to slide up and down.\nRadial\nBearings\nNut\nFPreload\nFReaction\nNut\nBearing\nspacer\nCaster\nFork\nRadial\nbearing\nCaster\nBarrel\nSpacer\nmisalign\n-ment\nFReaction\nFPreload\nExternal\nthread\nnut\nBearing\nspacer\nRadial\nbearing\nNut\nCaster\nBarrel\nCaster\nFork\nA) MOUNTING\nCONFIGURATION OF\nCASTOR SWIVEL\nBEARING\nB) CURRENT MOUNTING\nCONFIGURATION, OVER\nCONSTRAINED\nC) EXACTLY CONSTRAINED\nMOUNTING CONFIGURATION\nFIGURE 15\nMOUNTING OF CASTER BEARINGS\nFor comparison, Figure 15C shows a mounting configuration that exactly constrains the\nbearings. Tightening of the nut will not damage the bearings, as the preload force will be\ntransferred through the external faces of the inner races, which are designed to be compressed.\nThe bearings will not slide up and down because the external thread nut will exactly position the\nbottom bearing, and the upper bearing will be clamped between the spacer and the nut.\nIt is important to note that any configuration of radial bearings used in the castor swivel is\nundesirable, as radial bearings are not meant to support axial loads. Loading them axially can\ngreatly shorten their life. The proper configuration would be to use either two angular contact\nbearings, like what is used in bicycle hubs, or one radial and one thrust bearing, like what is\nsometimes used in bicycle stems.\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nAvailable Materials/Components\nA wide selection of steel and bicycle components is available in Tanzania. The country's largest\nsteel supplier, Doshi Hardwarexiv, was visited and their product line is included in the full\nreportxv. They carry a large range of low-carbon steel stock in many cross-sections. A bicycle\ncomponent supplier, Burhani Cycle Martxvi, was also visited during the assessment. Burhani\nprovides almost every bicycle component available, including frame joints to be brazed.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF ADVOCACY GROUP INTERVIEWS\nDuring the study 18 advocacy groups were interviewed. Their contact information can be found\nin the full reportxvii. Important information from the advocacy group interviews is summarized\nbelow.\n- Few organizations are able to purchase chairs, but international NGOs in Europe or the\nUS sometimes subsidize purchases.\n- The Wheelchair Foundationxviii (WF) has given away nearly 8,000 wheelchairsxix,xx in\nTanzania since 2000, but it does not use appropriate technology, fitting, or distribution\npractices. Three other NGOsxxi,xxii,xxiii in the same area as WF's largest distributor are in\ndesperate need of wheelchairs but do not receive regular donations.\n- The cost of wheelchairs produced in-country has to be reduced if they are to compete\nwith WF chairs. The price of a WF chair is $150US. Half of that price is paid by the WF,\nand the other half is paid by donors. If wheelchairs being produced in Tanzania were sold\nat or near $150US, they could better compete with the WF. Competitively pricing could\nalso possibly convince WF to buy locally and support the local economy as well as the\ndisabled.\n- All organizations interviewed agreed that they did not like the imported wheelchairs\nbecause replacement parts can not be obtained. They all thought using bicycle parts was a\ngood alternative because even in the most remote villages there is usually a bicycle repair\nshop with replacement parts.\nCONCLUSION\nThe purpose of this report was to gain insight into the factors that are preventing Tanzania's\ndisabled from utilizing wheelchair technology. Three types of interviews were conducted during\nthe assessment, one for each group involved with wheelchair technology: wheelchair and tricycle\nusers; wheelchair and tricycle manufacturers; and advocacy groups for the disabled. The most\ncritical points in the responses of each group are summarized below:\n- Wheelchair and tricycle users: Tricycles are the preferred mobility aid because they\noffer long-distance travel capability at a lower price compared to wheelchairs. Most\npeople rely on NGOs and other organizations to purchase mobility aids, and the majority\nof wheelchairs being used are imported. Bicycle shops are the most common place to get\nwheelchairs and tricycles repaired.\n- Wheelchair manufacturers: The WTTC wheelchairs cost $100US more than tricycles\nproduced in Tanzania. The UWZ wheelchair workshop is able to make a wheelchair\nessentially identical to the WTTC 4-wheeler and sell it for $140, which is $100US less\n\nInternational Journal for Service Learning in Engineering\nVol. 2, No. 1, pp. 60-77, Fall 2006\nISSN 1555-9033\nthan the WTTC workshops. Utilizing bicycle components and outsourcing lowers\nproduction costs. The manufacturing processes of local wheelchair manufactures could\nbe streamlined by using lean manufacturing techniques. Wheelchairs and tricycles being\nproduced in Tanzania have design weaknesses and should be reviewed to improve\nstrength and robustness.\n- Advocacy groups: Few organizations can afford to buy chairs, although some rely on\ninternational NGOs as sponsors. The WF donates an immense number of wheelchairs\nannually but without responsible distribution practices and full consideration of\nappropriate technology. Tanzanian wheelchairs should be priced to compete with the WF.\nThe use of bicycle parts in wheelchairs and tricycles designed for rural areas is\nappropriate because bicycle technicians and replacement parts are available throughout\nthe country.\nThe information gathered in the assessment was meant to aid TATCOT and WWI in planning\nstrategies for future wheelchair technology improvements in Tanzania. Ideally the report will aid\nTATCOT in improving the WTTC course and WWI in designing improved wheelchairs in the\nfuture.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe assessment was made possible through the financial support of the MIT Public Service\nCenter and summer fellowship directors Sally Susnowitz and Alison Hynd. The author would\nlike to thank his supervisors on the project, Harold Shangali from TATCOT and Marc Krizack\nfrom WWI, and his translator Joseline Mammba.

The earth exerts a force on\nevery object, pulling it towards the ground. This\nis known as the force due to gravity. When you\nmeasure the weight of a person, you are\nmeasuring the force of gravity pulling on him.\nWhen an object is stationary all the forces acting\non it are balanced. When the forces are not\nbalanced, the object will move. Forces are\nmeasured in Newtons or pounds. To convert\nkilograms to Newtons, multiply the number of\nkilograms by 9.81. One kilogram is equal to 2.2\nlbs.\nWhen you hold an orange you feel the force of\ngravity trying to pull it to the ground. Your\nhand has to push up on the orange to keep it\nfrom falling. The force the orange exerts on\nyour hand is equal in amount and opposite in\ndirection to the force your hand is exerting on\nthe orange (see the equation). When you put the\norange on a table, now the table is pushing on it\nwith an equal and opposite force. When you\ndrop the orange the forces on it are unbalanced.\nThe orange falls because the force of gravity\npulls it to the ground.\nSeat\nFrame\nFootrests\nExample: Holding an orange\nWheels\nF orange\nFhand\norange\nhand\nF\nF\n-\n=\nN\nF\nN\nF\nhand\nhand\n=\n⇒\n-\n=\nN\nF orange\n=\nAdd forces:\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

If you wanted to\nthink of gravity pulling on an object at a single\npoint, the CG is that location. Understanding CG\nlocation is important in wheelchair design. You\ncan approximate the force a person exerts on a\nwheelchair as his total weight applied at the CG\nof his body, which is a point around his hips.\nSeat\nFrame\nFootrests\nExample: Find the CG of a wrench\nWheels\nThe CG of the wrench is the point where the\nwrench can be balanced.

If you know the weight of the\nperson you know the force her body exerts on\nthe wheelchair. Because the wheelchair is not\nmoving the forces the ground exerts on the\nwheels and casters must add up to be equal and\nopposite to the force from the person's weight\n(note the \"Add forces\" equation is for 2 wheels\nand 2 casters).

When you tighten a\nbolt, you apply a moment to the bolt with a\nwrench. You produce the force with your body\nand the lever arm is the handle of the wrench.\nThe moment is calculated by multiplying the\nforce times the perpendicular (at a 90o angle)\ndistance from the pivot point. In every FBD, if\nthe object is stationary, both the forces and\nmoments need to add up to zero.\nFrame\nExample: Find forces with moments\nWheels\nSupport a wrench on two fingers, as shown in\nthe figure above. Since the object is not moving\nwe know the moments at each point must add\nup to zero. Calculating moments from point A,\nthe moment from the weight of the wrench,\nwhich acts at the CG, tries to make the wrench\nspin clockwise. The moment from our finger\nunder the head tries to make the wrench spin\nanticlockwise (negative direction). Knowing the\nmoments add to zero we can calculate the force\nat the head.

We can use the same methods as in the\nprevious examples to find internal forces and\nmoments. If an object is stationary, you know\nthat all the forces and moments have to balance\neach other. There are some different terms used\nto describe what occurs inside an object: Forces\nthat try to stretch or compress an object are\ncalled tensile (stretch) and compressive\n(compress) forces. Forces trying to tear the\nobject are called shear forces. Moments are still\ncalled moments on the inside of the object.\nFrame\nExample: Moments inside a wrench\nWheels\nThe moment a wrench applies to a nut is the\nforce multiplied by the length of the handle.\nThere is a moment at the head but no moment\nat the end of the handle. Now imagine taking a\ncut of the wench and drawing a FBD of both\npieces, which are stationary. The forces and\nmoments that act on the surface where the cut\nwas made on one piece are equal and opposite\nto those on the cut surface of the other piece.\nImagine cuts at different places along the\nwrench and notice the internal moment\ndecreases from the head to the handle.\nFhand\nMnut\nL\nnut\nF\nL/2\nCut\nMcut\nFhand\ncut\nF\nL/2\nAdd forces:\nAdd moments:\nhand\ncut\nnut\nF\nF\nF\n=\n=\n⎟⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎝\n⎛\n=\n=\n),\n(\nL\nF\nM\nL\nF\nM\nhand\ncut\nhand\nnut\n\naxle-horiz\nThis manual is free to anyone.

The maximum moment occurs where the axel is welded to the\nframe. Think about what might cause moments on the axle. There are vertical forces exerted on the\nwheel from the ground, but there also may be horizontal forces that act on the wheel when the chair\ntips over. The total moment in the axle is difficult to calculate and requires using trigonometry. If you\nare comfortable with trigonometry determine the moments in the axle when the chair is at the tipping\nangle. As an estimation, calculate the moments caused from the full weight of a person pushing on\none rear wheel, both vertically and horizontally. As you will see in the next sections, the moment in\nthe axle will determine if the metal is strong enough.

Area is important when\ncalculating the stress (see next section) and\nvolume is important when calculating the\nweight. You can calculate the weight of an\nobject if you know its volume and density.\nDensity is a material property that tells how\nmuch mass there is for a given volume. For\nexample, the density of water is 1 gram per each\ncubic centimeter (written as 1g/cm3) and the\ndensity of steel is 7.8g/cm3. Steel is heavier than\nwater, thus it sinks. If you want to know the\nmass of a steel part, you would multiply the\ndensity of the steel by the volume of the part.\nFor example, if your steel part had the\ndimensions of 10cm by 10cm by 20cm, the\nvolume would be 10cm X 10cm X 20cm =\n2000cm3. The mass would then be 7.8g/cm3 X\n2000cm3 = 15600g (notice the units of cm3\ncancelled out). 15600g is the same as 156kg.\nSeat\nFrame\nFootrests\nExample: Calculating mass of a part\nWheels\nh\nb\nL\nbh\nA\nArea\n=\n=\nAL\nV\nVolume\n=\n=\nh\nb\nL\nbh\nA =\nAL\nV =\nd\nL\nd\nA π\n=\ndi\nd o\n(\n)\ni\no\nd\nd\nA\n-\n= π\nAL\nV =\nAL\nV =\nL\nρ(kg/m3)\nMaterial\nPlastic\n(PVC)\nRubber\n(Butyl)\nAlum.\n78.7\nSteel\n(mild)\nDensity = ρ\n\nThis manual is free to anyone.

For\nexample, push on a table with your finger. The\nstress you exert on the table at the point under\nyour finger is the force with which you push\ndivided by the area of your finger that is in\ncontact with the table. Materials fail by bending,\ntearing, breaking, or stretching when they hit a\ncertain level of stress. Axial stress tries to pull or\ncompress a material (from tensile and\ncompressive forces). Shear stress tries to tear a\nmaterial (from shear forces).\nPush the fat end of a pen or pencil into your\nskin with a certain amount of force. Now flip\nthe pen around and use the same amount of\nforce to push the sharp end into your skin. The\nsharp end hurts because it exerts a higher stress\non your skin. Your body prevents you from\ntearing your skin by using pain to tell you if\nyour skin is getting stressed too much. Even\nthough you used the same amount of force in\nboth tests, the area of the sharp end of the\npencil is smaller, resulting in a higher stress on\nyour skin.\nFrame\nAxles\nBearings\nExample: Feeling stress with skin\nWheels\nA\nF\nStress\n=\n= σ\nm\nN\nmm\nN\n=\n=\nσ\nF=5N\nF=5N\nA1=62mm2\nA2=1.3mm2\n3.1\nm\nN\nmm\nN\n=\n=\nσ\nσ\nσ <<\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

If more stress is applied to a metal\npast the yield strength eventually the material\nwill break when it hits the ultimate strength.\nShear stresses can also permanently deform a\nmetal, and will be discussed in the next section.\nWhen engineering a wheelchair you always\nwant to use a saftey factor (SF), meaning you\nwant to prevent the stresses from coming within\na certain factor of the yield strength. In most\ncases a SF of 2 is enough but other cases\nrequire much higher SFs, up to 10 or 20.\nTake a piece of sheet metal and put it on a piece\nof wood. Now take an indenter and hit it lightly\nwith a hammer. No dent is left because the\nmaterial was not stressed enough to\npermanently deform. Now hit the material\nharder and harder until you first start to make a\ndent, which corresponds to the yield strength.\nHit harder so you make bigger dents and\neventually tear the metal, which corresponds to\nthe ultimate strength. As shown in the equation\nabove, the stress exerted on the metal is the\nhammer force divided by the indenter area.\nBehavior of metals\nFrame\nAxles\nBearings\nExample: Stressing sheet metal\nWheels\nDent Size\nFhammer\nYield strength = σy\nUltimate strength = σUTS\n\nThis manual is free to anyone.

This\ncauses a moment to be transmitted through the X-brace, which causes stress on the bolt holes. To\ndetermine the stress we can first calculate the force on the left wheel (F3) from the FBD looking at the\nfront of the chair. Next we look at the side of the chair and visualize the moment in the X-brace caused\nby F3. Finally we calculate the stress on the bolt hole by estimating the contact area between the bolt\nand the leg as 1⁄2 the surface area of the hole. Our final answer is well below the yield stress of mild\nsteel, but why do these holes still get over-stressed? The reason is shock loading, for instance when the\nuser jumps off a curb onto the road. Shock loading can easily magnify the static stresses (the stresses\ncaused by gravity when stationary) by 10 times, which in our example would raise the stress near the\nsteel's yield strength. One way to decrease the stress would be to increase the contact area.\nF person =500N\n3 points contact the ground\nCG\nF1\nF2\nF3\nFBD of\nchair front:\nF person\nF1\nF2\nF3\nA\nA\nN\nF\nF\nperson\n=\n=\nmm\nN\nM X\n⋅\n= 50000\nmm\nN\nt\nR\nF\narea\nContact\nF\nbolt\nb\nb\n8.\n=\n=\n=\nπ\nσ\nN\nD\nM\nF\nM\nD\nF\nX\nb\nX\nb\n=\n=\n⇒\n-\n=\n,\nm\nN\nm\nN\nsteel\ny\n=\n<\n=\nσ\nσ\nFBD on X-brace:\nFrom symmetry\nFX\nMX\nL\nMX\nFBD on 1 X-brace leg:\nL=200mm\n)\n(L\nF\nM\nperson\nX =\nFb\nFb\nF3\nD=25mm\nt=4mm\nContact\narea\nRbolt\nRbolt=5mm\nAdd moments about left hole:\nCalculate stress on contact area:\nDesign is safe for static loading but\npossibly not for shock loads (read below)\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

Strain is the\nmeasure of how much a material deforms when\nunder stress. Imagine pulling on a piece of metal\nand creating a stress. The material will stretch a\nlittle because of the stress. The amount it\nstretches divided by its original length is the\nstrain. If you do not pull too hard the metal can\nspring back to its original length, which means it\ndeformed elastically. When metals are deformed\nelastically the modulus of elasticity equals the\nstress divided by the strain. This relationship is\nshown in the example to the right.\nIn the sheet metal/indenter example, when you\nhit the indenter lightly it did not dent the metal.\nThe metal deformed elastically and was able to\nspring back to its original shape. As shown in\nthe graph and equation above, the stress and\nstrain relate through the modulus of elasticity\nup to the yield strength of the material. Metals\nlike steel and aluminum, shown on the graph,\nhave different modulus values. Steel feels\nstiffer because it has a higher modulus, but\nsome types of aluminum (not all) are stronger\nbecause they have a higher yield strength.\nFrame\nAxles\nBearings\nExample: Stress, strain, modulus\nWheels\nε\nσy,alum\nσUTS, alum\nσ\nε\nσ\n=\nE\nold\nold\nnew\nL\nL\nL\nstrain\n-\n=\n= ε\nEalum\nEsteel\nσy, steel\nσUTS, steel\nModulus of\nelasticity\nσ y\n(N/mm2)\nE\n(N/mm2)\nMaterial\nPlastic\n(PVC)\n-\nRubber\n(Butyl)\nAlum.\n(6061)\nSteel\n(mild)\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

It is defined as the shear force\ndivided by the area over which the force is\nacting. The shear strength of metals, the amount\nof shear stress to cause failure, is approximately\n1⁄2 the yield strength. This means you can easily\ncalculate the amount of shear stress a part can\nwithstand by knowing the yield strength. Make\nsure the shear stressess are below 1⁄2 the yield\nstrength. If you used a safety factor of 2, which\nis good engineering practice, you would make\nsure the shear stress is below 1⁄4 the yield\nstrength.\nA punch uses shear stress to make a hole in\nsheet metal. We can calculate the amount of\nforce it takes to make the hole by knowing the\nyield strength (σ y) and thickness (t) of the\nmaterial and the diameter of the punch (D). See\nthe example for the equation to predict\npunching force.

One example is in the X-brace pivot of a wheelchair.\nUnder normal conditions, when the wheelchair is upright and on level ground, no shear stress exists in\nthe bolt. But as the wheelchair frame flexes, shear stresses can be exerted on the bolt where the two\nlegs of the X-brace meet. If you know the forces the legs of the X-brace apply to the bolt and the\ndiameter of the bolt, you can calculate the amount of shear stress in the bolt. To estimate the shear\nforce you can use the weight of the person in the chair. Remember shock loads will also exist, so the\nactual forces might be many times the person's weight.

On one side of the part\nthe material is stretched and thus has tensile\nstresses. On the other side the material is\ncompressed by compressive stresses. Most\nmetals can be bent a little bit (elastically) and\nspring back to their original shape. If you bend\nmetal too far it will pertinently deform because\nthe tensile and compressive stresses will\nbecome larger than the yield stress of the\nmaterial. As you will see in the next section, the\nmoment in a part directly relates to the bending\nstresses.\nTake the handle of a spoon with the flat side up.\nBend the handle slightly and it will spring back.\nBend it a little farther and it will be\npermanently bent. When the spoon is bent\ndownward (as shown) the top of the spoon is\nbeing stretched by tensile stresses and the\nbottom is being compressed by compressive\nstresses. The spoon permanently bends when\ntensile and compressive stresses become larger\nthan the yield stress of the metal from which\nthe spoon is made.\nBending stress\nFrame\nAxles\nExample: Bending a spoon\nTensile stresses\nM\nM\nCompressive\nstresses\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

When a part is\nbent the material at the outer surface feels the\nhighest stress. If the part is made thicker the\nmaterial at the outer surface has more leverage,\nso the part will be stronger. The part will also\nbe stiffer because it will bend less under a given\nmoment. The moment of inertia (I) is a measure\nof how well the part geometry uses material to\ncounteract bending moments. As you will see\non the next page, the maximum stress in a part\nis directly related to the applied moment, the\nthickness of the part, and the moment of inertia.\nUse the same spoon you bent in the last\nexample. Now flip it so the thin side is facing\nup and try bending it. The amount of material\ndid not change but the spoon seems stronger\nand stiffer because the moment of inertia is\nhigher with the thin side up than with the flat\nside up. If you know the moment applied to the\npart, and the moment of inertia, you can find\nthe maximum stress the part experiences.

The figure above shows a\nhollow and solid axle. Both axles are the same\nlength, have the same moment applied (M), and\nare made of the same material (ρ). As you can\nsee from the calculation, the hollow axle is 88%\nstronger (because it has a lower stress under the\nsame moment) and 29% lighter than the solid\naxle. By just changing the geometry (and\nmoment of inertia) a part can be made\nsignificantly stronger and lighter.\nIncreasing the moment of inertia of a part\nmakes it both stronger and stiffer. The\ngeometry of the part determines the moment of\ninertia. This fact is very powerful, as it allows\nparts to be made stronger without adding more\nmaterial. Consider the frame of a bicycle; the\ntubes are hollow to maintain a large moment of\ninertia while keeping the weight low.

For\nexample, when you push on a spring with a force\nit compresses, resulting in a deflection. The\nstiffness of a material depends on the modulus\nof elasticity. The stiffness and strength of a part\ndepends on the modulus and the part's geometry.\nJust because something is stiff does not mean it\nis strong. Rubber bands are strong but have very\nlow stiffness. Glass is very stiff but not strong\nwhen it is bent. Steel is a great material because\nit is stiff and strong. It makes a wheelchair\nrugged and feel sturdy.\nAll parts have a certain amount of stiffness. The\nstiffness of a part depends on the material and\nthe geometry. Equations for the stiffness of\ndifferent parts are given in the figure above.\nNotice that the stiffness of each part has the\nmodulus of elasticity (E) in the equation. This\nmeans the part can be made stiffer if it is made\nfrom a material with a higher modulus of\nelasticity. In the beam examples, stiffness also\nincreases with the moment of inertia.\nFrame\nAxles\nBearings\nExample: Stiffness of different parts\nWheels\nColumn\nCantilevered\nbeam\nCenter-loaded\nbeam\nF\nGround\nL\nA\nL\nEA\nk =\ndeflection\n=\nδ\nδ\nF\nk =\nL\nEI\nk =\nδ\nF\nk =\nL\nF\nI\nF\nI\nL\nL\nEI\nk =\nδ\nF\nk =\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

It is the job of an\nengineer to determine what type of stress may\ncause failure. In most instances one kind of\nstress will be much higher than the others so the\npart will fail due to the highest stress. In other\ninstances if two stresses are about the same\nlevel, for example bending and shear, you have\nto use an equivalent stress. The equivalent stress\ncan be approximated as 2 times the largest\nindividual stress (see the example for using an\nequivalent stress).\nThe axles in this example are under simple\ncantilevered loading. In a normal to very long\naxle bending stresses will be the largest type of\nstress. In a very short axle the shear stresses\nwill dominate. In a medium length axle the\nshear and bending stresses will be about the\nsame size. In this case an equivalent stress has\nto be used.

The stress\nconcentration is a number that tells you how\nmuch the geometry intensifies the stress. To\nfind the actual stress at a location, first calculate\nthe stress without the concentration and then\nmultiply by the stress concentration (see the\nexample for stress concentrations in different\ngeometries). As a conservative estimate, most\nstress concentrations are about 3. This means if\nyou have a sudden change in geometry, plan for\nthe stresses at the change to be about 3 times\nlarger than in the rest of the part.\nThe figure above shows stress concentrations\nfor common geometries. You can decrease\nstress concentrations by using a more gradual\ngeometry (example: use a fillet instead of a\nsharp corner) Note: If you need to put a hole in\na part that has a moment applied to it, drill the\nhole near the center, as the highest stresses will\nbe on the outer surface of the part (see the\nfigure). If the hole diameter is small compared\nto the height of the part (less than 1/5th) you do\nnot have to account for the stress concentration.\nStress concentration\nFrame\nAxles\nExample: Common concentrations\nCasters\nM\nM\nM\nM\nF\nF\nh\nh/5\nNo stress\nconcentration\nσ\n3σ\nK=3\nK=3\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

This is called St.\nVenant's Principle. A characteristic length is\nthe important dimension at a specific location\nin a machine. It may be a hole diameter, the\nthickness of a plate, or the diameter of a shaft.\nThe opposite is also true: if you want a part to\nfeel an effect (for example being clamped\nfirmly into place) it should be held over 3 to 5\ncharacteristic lengths.\nSt. Venant's principle is very useful when\ndesigning wheelchair frames. If any part\nprotrudes more than 3 to 5 characteristic\nlengths away from the wheelchair (the\ncharacteristic length could be the tubing\ndiameter or the part height) then the frame\nmight not feel stiff. The footrest frame on\nAfrican-made wheelchairs is very well\ndesigned. The footrests are cantilevered but do\nnot extend more than 3 to 5 times the height of\nthe caster frame.\nSt. Venant's\nFrame\nAxles\nExample: Caster frame design\nBearings\nCasters\nFootrests\nh\n3h\n\nThis manual is free to anyone.

If the axle\nis cantilevered any more the bearings can be\nhurt by axle deflection.\nYou learned the stress concentration at a hole in\na part under tension will be approximately 3. As\nyou move away from the hole the stresses\nreturn to a level as if the hole was not there. In\nthis case the characteristic length is the hole\ndiameter.

A structural\nloop is a visual way of representing how forces\ntravel through a structure. If the path the forces\ntake is narrow, the structure will be stiff. For\nexample, picture the forces that travel through\nthe caster frame. The forces start at the ground\nand move up through the caster barrel. At the\ntop of the barrel they travel into the frame, loop\naround the frame, and come back to the bottom\nof the barrel. Now imagine if the caster frame\nwas very long - the structural loop would be\nlarger and the frame would be less stiff.\nImagine you are evaluating whether to use two\ndifferent frame layouts. One frame is a narrow\nrectangle and another is a long rectangle. Each\nframe has a force applied to the end, as shown\nin the figure. Follow the force flow through the\nframe and back to the point where the force is\napplied. The narrow frame will be stiffer\nbecause it has a tighter structural loop.\nStructural loops\nFrame\nCaster frame\nExample: Structural loops in frames\nFootrests\nF\nF\nMore stiff\nLess stiff\nForce flow\nForce flow\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

Your body is\nbuilt around this ratio; it is approximately the\nratio between your overall height and the\ndistance from your hips to the ground. Many\nother animals and plants are built around this\nproportion. When used in engineering the\ngolden ratio makes devices look aesthetically\npleasing and perform well. For example, the\ndistance between the tires along the length of a\ncar is usually about 1.6 times the width of the\ncar.\nLook at the different doors in the above\nexample. Which one looks the most attractive?\nThe door that fits the golden ratio has the most\npleasing proportions.\nGolden ratio\nFrame\nAxles\nExample: Door proportions\nBearings\nCasters\nFootrests\n1.6\n1/3\n\nThis manual is free to anyone.

These\nproportions also make it perform well - the\nchair is well balanced and can easily climb over\nobstacles.\nWhen you want one cylinder to slide within\nanother make sure the length in which they\noverlap is at least 1.6 times the diameter. If the\noverlap distance is smaller than the golden ratio\nthe cylinders might jam and not slide easily\nagainst each other. If space allows, using a ratio\nlarger than 1.6 to 1 will make the device\nperform even better. The footrest clamp on the\nAfrican-made wheelchair is well designed, as\nthe clamping cylinder overlaps the frame tube\nby 3 times the tube diameter.\nx x\n1.6 x\nD\n3D\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

Any\nmovement an object makes is composed of\nsome or all of these DOFs. You can constrain\nDOFs to limit an object's movement. Exact\nconstraint design is a method of using only one\nconstraint for each unwanted DOF. As you will\nsee in the examples, over constraining objects is\noften necessary but in other instances can make\nthem deform or break.\nThe cube shown is not touching anything so it\nhas 6 DOFs: 3 rotational (curved arrows) and 3\ntranslational (strait arrows). The 3-legged milk\nstool has three points that touch the ground.\nEach point acts as a constraint, thus the stool\nhas only 3 DOFs. From geometry, 2 points\ndefine a line and 3 points define a plane. No\nmatter how rough the surface on which the\nstool sits, three legs will always touch 3 points\nthat define the plane of the ground. This is why\na milk stool does not rock back and forth, no\nmatter what kind of ground it is on.\nExact constraint\nFrame\nAxles\nExample: DOFs of objects\nBearings\nCasters\nFootrests\nDOFs of free-\nfloating cube\nZ\nθZ\nY\nθY\nX\nθX\nExactly constrained\nmilk stool\nPlane of the\nground\nContact\npoints\n\nRocking motion\nStool deformed for\nall legs to touch\nContact\npoints\nGround\nplane\nUnder-constrained\nUnder-constrained\n4-leg milk stool\n4-leg milk stool\nExample: 3 and 4-legged stools\nAs you saw in the last example a 3-legged stool\nwill always touch the ground at 3 points, which\nmakes it exactly constrained. A 4-legged stool\ntries to touch the ground with 4 points but the\nplane of the ground is defined by 3 points. This\nmeans if 1 leg is too long or short only 2 the\nlegs will touch the ground and the stool will\nrock back and forth between the other 2 legs. In\nthis case the stool is under-constrained, as there\nare 2 constraints when we need 3. If we forced\nall 4 legs to touch the ground the table would\nflex and would be over-constrained.\nGround\nplane\nContact point\nExample: 3 and 4 wheeled chairs\nA wheelchair will act the same way as a stool\non rough ground. A 3-wheeled chair will\nalways have its wheels touching the ground\nwhile a 4 wheeled chair will have one wheel lift\noff as it goes over rough terrain, as shown in the\nfigure. A 3-wheeled chair will have a lower\ntipping angle, as the CG is closer to the line\nbetween the front and rear wheel contact points,\nbut it may be more comfortable to use on rough\nground. When deciding whether to prescribe a 3\nor 4-wheeled chair the types of ground over\nwhich the user travels should be considered.\nThis manual is free to anyone.

In the example with the 4-\nlegged stool, if all 4 legs were forced to touch\nthe ground the stool could flex too much and\nbreak. If a bearing is forced into an unnatural\nconfiguration it can deform, bend, or shatter.\nThink about the constraints on an axle - the\naxle should only have 1 DOF (rotation), and so\nit must have 5 constraints. If the bearings\nprovide more than 5 constraints the shaft or\nbearings could become damaged.\nThe figure above shows the configuration of the\ncastor barrel assembly in an African-made\nwheelchair. This design has the potential to\nover-constrain and damage the bearings if the\nspacer is too short. As the nut is tightened the\nmarbles will be sheared. To picture this imagine\nthere is no spacer. The tightening force of the\nnut would transfer into the bearing and shear\nthe marbles, as shown in the figure.\nMounting bearings\nRear wheels\nCaster barrels\nExample: Caster barrel bearings\nCasters\nFPreload\nNut\nBearing\nspacer\nRadial\nbearing\nCaster\nbarrel\nSpacer\nmisalign-\nment\nFReaction\n\nThis manual is free to anyone.

This case is better than over constraining the bearings. No matter\nhow precisely the spacer and caster barrel are made they will not be perfect - the assembly will either\nbe over or under-constrained. There is a way to assemble the bearings so they are exactly constrained,\nas shown in the second picture of the figure. In this design all the forces from the nut are transferred\nthrough the bearing race and not through the marbles. Nut tightness will never harm the marbles.

An axial load is a\nforce acting in the direction of the center of the\nshaft and a radial load is a force acting\nperpendicular to the shaft, as shown in the\nexample. It is the job of an engineer to\ndetermine what kinds of forces will act on a\nbearing (radial, axial, or both), and choose the\nbest bearing for that particular machine.\nThe figure above shows a radial and an angular\ncontact bearing. Notice how the races of each\nbearing are different. The angular contact\nbearing has angled races so it can support both\nradial and axial forces. The radial bearing is not\ngood for axial forces. There is not much area of\nthe race to support the marbles when they are\nloaded in the axial direction.\nBearing types\nRear wheels\nCaster barrels\nExample: Types of bearings\nCasters\nRadial bearing\nAngular contact\nbearings\nwww.ntnamerica.com\nwww.gsportbmx.co.uk\nFradial\nFreaction\nRace Marble\nFradial\nFreaction\nRace\nMarble\nFaxial\n\nThis manual is free to anyone. Please photocopy and distribute.\nExample: Angular contact bearings used in bicycles\nAngular contact bearings are used in bicycles because bicycles experience both radial and axial forces.\nThese bearings may be good alternatives to the radial bearings used in wheelchairs, especially in caster\nbarrels where the highest forces are axial. Different types of angular contact bearings are made for\ndifferent areas of the bicycle, such as the hubs and stem. Bicycle bearings are usually over-constrained\nbut are designed with a lock nut. When you install a bicycle bearing first tighten the marbles so they\nare securely in place, and then tighten the locknut to keep the assembly from coming apart.\nThe figure above shows a concept for a caster barrel and caster design using bicycle hubs. The caster\nbarrel is made from a bicycle hub welded directly to the wheelchair frame. Some wheelchair\nmanufacturers already use bicycle hubs pressed into molded rubber casters - the African-made\nwheelchair shown throughout this manual has this caster design.\nStem bearings\nAssembled view\nDisassembled view\nFront hub\nAssembled view\nDisassembled view\nFrame\nHub\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

The\nsoap keeps the oil from running out of the\nbearing and insures it remains under the bearing\nmarbles. When the bearing is lubricated\nproperly the marbles never touch the race and\nactually roll on a thin film of oil. It is very\nimportant to keep bearings clean, as small\nparticles of dirt can damage the marbles and\nraces.\nThe figure above shows grease wedged between\nthe bearing marble and race. Grease becomes\nvery stiff and acts almost like a solid when it is\nsqueezed between the marble and the race in\nthe contact zone. This is how it prevents getting\nsqueezed out when the bearing is loaded. The\ngrease film is very thin, only a few millionths\nof a meter thick. It is extremely important to\nkeep the bearings clean, as dirt within the\ngrease film can damage the marbles and races.\nBearing lubrication\nRear wheels\nCaster barrels\nExample: Grease under marbles\nCasters\nF\nMarble\nGrease\nRace\nContact\nzone\n\nWhere useful\nThis manual is free to anyone.

The lean\nmanufacturing techniques presented in this\nsection may or may not be useful to your\nworkshop. Before implementing these\nstrategies the workshop should estimate or run\nan experiment to see whether or not the strategy\ncan save time and/or money.\nOutsourcing\nOutsourcing is a term to describe hiring another\ncompany to make components instead of\nmaking them within your wheelchair workshop.\nMany wheelchair workshops already outsource\ncaster wheels by having the rubber molded at\nanother facility. For parts that require many\nhours to fabricate or the use of a special\nmachine, one should consider the cost and\nbenefit of producing the part within the\nwheelchair workshop or at another company.\nFor example, there are wheelchair parts which\nneed to be turned on a lathe. If the profit made\nfrom those parts takes more than a few years to\nequal the cost of the lathe, those parts should\nprobably be outsourced to a company that\nspecializes in metal fabrication. The money that\nwould be used to buy a lathe could be invested\nelsewhere within the workshop.\nPull method for acquiring parts\nThe pull method is a strategy where a company\nbuys parts only when needed. Instead of storing\na large inventory of parts, the company will\nmake or order parts when necessary. There are\ncases when parts do need to be stored, for\nLean manufacturing\nFrame\nAxles\nBearings\nCasters\nFootrests\n\nexample if they can only be bought in large\nquantities or if it is faster to make many parts at\none time. The pull strategy is sometimes useful\nbecause it decreases inventory size, which\nreduces the required workshop size. Also, by\npurchasing a few parts at a time the company\ncan avoid paying a lot of money at once.\nMinimal weight design\nWeight should be considered when designing a\nwheelchair. Reducing weight not only makes\nthe chair easier to use, it also lowers the\nmaterial cost. One weight-reducing strategy is\nto design your frame so all the features add\nstrength. Try to avoid features that add weight\nbut do not add strength. Another strategy is to\nmaximize the strength and minimize the weight\nof the frame tubing. Review the section of this\nmanual on volume and moment of inertia\ncalculations. Calculate the moment of inertia\nand weight for a 1 meter section of all the\navailable sizes of steel tubing you can buy.\nThen find which tubing geometry has the\nhighest ratio of moment of inertia divided by\nthe weight. This tube will have the best strength\nto weight ratio and can be used to make the\nstrongest frame at the least weight. You will\nhave to check that the tubing size is practical.\nEven if it has the best strength to weight it\nmight not be a sensible choice. For example, if\nthe diameter is 10 centimeters and the weight is\n50 kilograms per meter, the tubing is too big\nand heavy to be used in a wheelchair.\nUtilize purchased parts\nJust like you do with outsourcing, consider both\nmaterial and labor costs of parts that have to be\nfabricated. If you can buy parts that are made in\nChina or India, they may save you a lot of\nmoney. You will have to compare cost with\nreliability of the parts, as you want to maintain\nhigh-quality wheelchairs.\nUsing bicycle parts\nThe use of bicycle parts in wheelchairs has\nmany advantages. Bicycle parts are often\navailable throughout Africa, they can be easily\ndisassembled to be cleaned and greased, and\nthey are easily repaired by bicycle mechanics.\nBicycle parts are often much cheaper than other\nparts that perform the same function. For\nexample, in Tanzania the majority of the parts\nin hand-powered tricycles are purchased bicycle\nThis manual is free to anyone. Please photocopy and distribute.\n\nparts. By using these parts tricycle\nmanufacturers have to fabricate very few items,\nwhich greatly reduces their production cost.\nThey are able to sell tricycles for $100US less\nthan most Tanzanian-made wheelchairs.\nSingle jig/symmetric frame design\nA wheelchair has a left and right side. Some\ncomponents are only used on one side or the\nother. Manufacturing time for a wheelchair can\nbe reduced if parts can be used on both sides.\nFor example, if the frame components on each\nside of a wheelchair were the same, only one jig\nwould be required during fabrication. Making\n\"universal\" parts which work on both sides of\nthe chair also decreases the number of different\nparts you have to keep in your inventory.\nThis manual is free to anyone.

It is liberating, not confining.\nBut if assistive devices - including wheelchairs - are to help disabled persons reach their potential, they must be carefully selected, designed, and\nadapted to meet each individual's unique combination of needs. In this book's Introduction we saw how standard wheelchairs from the North,\ndonated to 4 women in different countries and circumstances, proved unsatisfactory. This was because the providers did not take into account the\nparticular needs and wishes of each individual. Nor did they consider cultural factors, living conditions, local terrain, available transport, or\nquestions of accessibility. By contrast, we saw much better results when such factors were taken into account, and when needs and possibilities were\ndiscussed with the disabled person and family as part of a creative, problem-solving approach.\nEven when persons with the same disability live in the same town, their needs for equipment may vary, depending on their lifestyle,\noptions for schooling or work, and other factors. Cost and convenience must also be considered.\nFor example, before the wheelchair builders at PROJIMO make a chair for a person, they ask if the chair will need to be transported in a\nmotor vehicle, and if so, what kind. To fit into a passenger car, it helps if the chair can be folded.\nBut, if the chair will be carried in the back of a truck, folding may be less important. For many families, keeping the price down may seem\nmore essential. A non-folding chair can be made at lower cost, is lighter weight, and is often more trouble free.\nIn this part of the book we look at the needs of different persons, not only for wheelchairs, but also for other equipment in the realm\nof \"wheeled mobility.\" This includeswheeled cots, (gurneys, trollies) and hand-powered tricycles. Our emphasis is on\ndevelopment of a particular mobility aid to meet the specific needs, circumstances, and possibilities of an individual user. For this\nreason we often describe the situation in story form, and may sometimes include the development of other innovations for the same\nperson.\nWheels work for getting around only when there is access to where you want to go. This means everything from sufficiently smooth,\nfirm walkways and roads, to ramps and in some cases lifts or elevators. In Chapter 35 we describe a low cost elevator with gravity\nlift.\nIn this book we do not include detailed instructions on design and production of standard wheelchairs. Four very different wheelchair designs are in the book, Disabled Village Children.\nDetails for building the excellent, low-cost Whirlwind Wheelchair are found in Independence Through Mobility, by Ralf Hotchkiss (see p.343). Here we do, however, include some of\nthe most recent breakthroughs in the Whirlwind design (in Chapter 30).\nOOPS! THINK AGAIN!\n- The Importance of Deciding With, and Not For, the User\n2 of 5\n2/17/2007 9:28 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without Us - PART FOUR(Introduction)\nOne day, two persons from PROJIMO visited the home of a disabled child in the city of Mazatlan. The child's mother told them about a neighboring family with two children who could\nnot walk. \"They're smart little kids,\" she said, \"but their bodies are too weak to walk.\"\nTogether, the mother and the PROJIMO workers went to visit these neighbors. They found the two children alone in the house with a baby sitter. The sitter was friendly and invited the\nvisitors to examine the children, who were playing on the floor. It appeared that the children had an inherited muscle weakness, perhaps some form of muscular dystrophy.\nMARCOS, the older child, was six years old. He pointed proudly to a big wheelchair in the corner. \"Put me in my car!\" he insisted. The\nwheelchair, donated by a government family aid program, was adult size. The small boy sat in it with his feet sticking out over the front edge of the\nseat. He tried to move the chair by pushing on the wheel rims, but had to stretch his arms far apart to reach them. The chair was so heavy, he could\nbarely move it.\n\"We have a small, light wheelchair in Ajoya that should fit him much better,\" said one PROJIMO worker. \"We will bring it on our next trip.\"\nAnd so they did. The chair fit Marcos well. Although his arms were quite weak, he could move it about slowly in\nplaces where the ground was level and fairly smooth.\nOn this visit the children's mother was home. The PROJIMO workers suggested that she trade the big chair for\nthe small one. But she insisted on keeping the big one. The PROJIMO workers explained all the reasons why\nthe small chair was more appropriate: \"Marcos sits in a better position. He can move it by himself. It is lighter\nand takes up less space. And, because the seat is lower, with practice he may learn to climb into and out of it by\nhimself.\"\nThe children's mother listened politely, then said, \"But you don't understand! For us, the big chair is best. You see,\nI don't have a husband. I sell tacos in the street market. Often I don't have any money to pay a baby sitter. So I have to\ntake both children with me to the market. In the big chair I can seat both of them together!\"\nThat was something the PROJIMO workers had not thought of. Given the circumstances, the big chair meets the\nfamily's needs better than the small chair.\nFrom this experience, the PROJIMO workers learned the importance of including the family - from the beginning - in the problem-solving process. They\nyielded to the mother's choice of the over-sized chair.\nBut Marcos was unhappy. He had fallen in love with the small chair, which he could move around by himself. It would be hard to take the small chair back, once the boy\nhad tried it.\nIn the end, the team made a costly but caring decision. The family kept both chairs. Marcos was, of course, delighted.\n3 of 5\n2/17/2007 9:28 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without Us - PART FOUR(Introduction)\nSometimes Simple Solutions Are More Appropriate than Complex Ones\nOften a simple device can make as big a difference as a more complex one. And if the device is simple, the user can understand, make, adapt, and control it more easily. Mike\nMiles, a perceptive observer who worked in community-based rehabilitation in Pakistan for many years, tells a thought-provoking story, which I paraphrase below.\nWHICH IS MORE APPROPRIATE? ... WHO IS MORE INDEPENDENT?\nOne time, in Europe, a man with paralyzed legs wanted to mail a registered letter at the Post Office. He drove his specially adapted van to the city center and parked in a\ndisabled-parking spot near the Post Office. Using his van's motorized lift, he lowered himself in his wheelchair to the street. In his battery-powered wheelchair he zoomed to the front\nof the Post Office, only to discover that there were three steps he must go up to get inside. Unlike most Post Offices in Europe, there was no ramp! Cursing the insensitivity and\nunfairness of society, he turned his wheelchair around, roared back to his van, hoisted himself and his chair up into it on the lift, and angrily drove home - his letter unmailed.\nAt the same time, in far-away Pakistan, another man who also had both legs paralyzed wanted to mail a letter at the local Post Office. He hopped on his small skate-board and pushed\nhimself quickly along the narrow streets.\nHe hitched a ride by holding onto the back of a horse-drawn cart. At last he reached the Post Office. To enter it, there were 10 steps and no ramp No worry! He scooted off the\nskate-board onto the first step. With his arms, he lifted himself on his backside from one step to the next, dragging his skate-board with him. When he reached the top step, he hopped\nback on his skate-board, rolled to the counter, and handed the letter up to the postal clerk.

Those injured are mostly\ncivilians, including women and children. Supplied by giant arms manufacturers in the North, LAND MINES ARE DESIGNED TO CRIPPLE, NOT TO KILL.\nThis is part of the strategy of \"low-intensity conflict.\" Leaving people seriously disabled puts a greater burden on families and on the nation than does killing people\noutright.\nNational Rehab Centers in Angola - A Chronic Shortage of Materials\nTo do something for the vast numbers of civilians disabled by war, the government of Angola set up large rehabilitation centers in each province. These were intended to provide\ndisabled persons with rehabilitation, assistive devices, and training in skills such as leather-work and carpentry, so they could soon return to their homes. But at the centers - as in the\nwhole war-torn and economically devastated country - there was a chronic shortage of even basic materials such as leather, wood, nails, and glue. As a result, neither assistive\nequipment nor skills training were being provided. The rehab centers had become little more than long-term holding camps - sheltered workshops with no work.\nTo try to find a way out of this situation, in 1990 the Ministry of Social Affairs together with the Development Workshop (a Canadian non-profit group) organized a national workshop.\nOne director and one disabled person from each of 15 provincial centers attended. The author (David Werner) and Kennett Westmacott were among the outside facilitators.\nA National Workshop to Develop Equipment and Skills\nTHE GARBAGE DUMP AS A SOURCE OF SUPPLIES\nThe purpose of the workshop was to figure out how to make assistive devices at low cost and with a scarcity of tools and materials.

We collected bits of wire, old plastic buckets, car tires, inner tubes, and bits of metal.\nAbout the only wood available was from broken packing crates left over from international aid shipments. Also, there were branches that\ncould be cut from the few remaining ornamental trees.\nSTARTING WITH BARE HANDS AND SHARP EYES\nTo start off the workshop, Kennett showed the group how to make a saw by filing teeth into the steel strapping from old packing crates. The\nblade is stretched between a frame made from sticks, and tightened by twisting a wire.\nTo get ideas for building things from scrap, we went into the streets and watched children\nplaying with their homemade scooters, pushcarts, and baby carriages. The wheels of these were\nmade of wood, or with large bearings from junked or bombed trucks. The ingenuity of the street\nchildren, inventing playthings out of anything at hand, was an inspiration and challenge to all.\n2 of 12\n2/17/2007 9:29 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 29)\nLEARNING TO MAKE ASSISTIVE DEVICES.\nDuring the 2-week workshop, the group managed to make a wide variety of assistive devices. These were mostly created to meet the expressed needs of the disabled participants.\nFor example, one participant, named KOFI, had paralysis in the lower body, with hip and knee contractures. He scooted about on his backside using\nhis hands. He wanted some way to move faster and easier. So the group designed and made for him:\nA log scooter-board with wooden wheels;\nHand \"shoes\" with soles made from old tires.\nTo meet a wider range of disability needs, the workshop invited disabled adults and children in the local community (on the outskirts of\nLuanda) to visit. Devices that the workshop participants created to meet the needs of these visitors included:\nA foldable sitting frame for a disabled child\nArtificial legs (both rustic and prefabricated) (see page 180)\nAn arm rocker, so that a person with a paralyzed arm can feed herself\nA special seat with a table made of foam plastic (see page 179), and toys for a child with cerebral palsy\nAn enclosed swing made from an old tire, turned inside out (see page 57)\nA 3-legged walking stick made from tree branches (page 174)\nRamps for wheelchair access and exercise (see page 230)\nAn orthopedic lift for a sandal or shoe, made from old foam-rubber \"thongs\"\nUnder-arm and elbow crutches, made from tree branches\nA tray for disabled persons to transport drinks without spilling them (see Chapter 22, page 135)\n3 of 12\n2/17/2007 9:29 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 29)\nWheels, pieced together from old wooden packing crates (see the next two pages)\nA wooden wheelchair, made from packing crates (see page 178)\nLeg braces made from an old plastic bucket, especially designed for a little girl with severe bowing of the knees\nHOW TO MAKE A WOODEN WHEEL\nMaterials: Wooden planks, Glue, Nails and Old Tire( bicycle or car).\nBasic Tools: Saw, Hammer, Book (square), Sting (tape measure).\nExtra Helpful Tools: Drill, Chisel, Wood file, Wood plane, Clamps.\n1.

He walked with great difficulty, supporting his weight with a pole. Moses very much wanted a\nwheelchair. At first this seemed virtually impossible, given the !ack of key materials, especially wheels. But the group was determined to try. The best building material they had was\npoor-quality, half-inch-thick planks they had scavenged from o!d packing crates.\nWith suggestions from Moses and others, the group drew an initial design for a wooden wheelchair. When the final design was agreed upon, the\ndrawing was enlarged to full size on packing paper, so that the different pieces could be traced onto suitable pieces of wood.\nKennett Westmacott had already taught the participants how to piece together large wooden wheels, using scrap wood from the packing crates. The\ngroup put together the wheels and the entire chair using nails pulled out of the packing crates and then hammered straight.\nThe outer edge of the big wheels were covered with strips of rubber cut from old car tires.\nInstruction sheets for making the large wheels were provided by Kennett, and are reproduced (with minor\nmodifications) on the two pages before this one.\nWith 4 small ball-bearings they had found, they mounted the back wheels on an axle made from a length of 3/4\ninch reinforcing rod. The bearings were force-fitted (with a hammer) into inset-holes chiseled into square\npieces of Angolan hardwood, found by the scavengers.\nFor the small front wheels of the chair, participants had hoped to use large truck bearings, similar to those that the\nstreet children use for scooters. But the bearings proved difficult to find. At last, someone located a couple of old\nplastic caster wheels, so these were used. No welding was needed for any part of the wheelchair.\nBy dividing into small groups that worked at the same time on different parts of the project, the chair was\ncompleted in 4 days. It was remarkably sturdy and functional. Moses, who had played a key role in building his\nchair, loved it. As a last addition, he built a small box on the outer edge of the wooden footrest to hold the front\n6 of 12\n2/17/2007 9:29 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 29)\nend of his walking stick.\nAN OUTCOME: MUTUAL RESPECT GAINED BY DIRECTORS AND DISABLED PARTICIPANTS\nPerhaps the most worthwhile part of the workshop was the understanding and respect that grew between the members. At the start, the\ndirectors of the rehab centers were hesitant to take part in the manual work. They were reluctant to put themselves on an equal footing\nwith the disabled participants, many of whom were unschooled villagers. The disabled persons, in turn, seemed unsure of themselves and\nuncomfortable when working alongside the administrators.\nHowever, in the process of working and problem-solving together, everyone began to relax and to appreciate each other's skills. In some\nareas, such as measuring and interpreting graphic designs, the officials were more able. But in the use of tools and building of devices,\nmany of the people with disabilities were obviously more capable. Each group learned from the other. By the end of the workshop, a\nstrong sense of camaraderie had developed, and everyone seemed more confident.\nTHE BEGINNING OF AN ORGANIZATION OF DISABLED PEOPLE IN ANGOLA\nAnother important outcome of the workshop was unplanned. The disabled participants, who came from many parts of the country, recognized that they had a lot of common concerns.\nThey also realized that, by working together to try to solve one another's problems, they could accomplish a lot.\nAs a result, they began to talk about forming some kind of a network, or organization. This was significant because, at that time, there was no\nassociation of disabled people in Angola.\nHowever, there was a major barrier to forming such an organization. At that time, because of all the terrorism and social unrest, the government\nprohibited all popular organizations, even at the community level. Fortunately, a high official in the Ministry of Social Affairs attended the closing\nceremony of the workshop. The disabled participants presented to her their need and desire to form a national organization of disabled people. The\nofficial promised to arrange permission for this. We learned later that permission was granted, and an Angolan branch of Disabled People's\nInternational has now become a reality.\n7 of 12\n2/17/2007 9:29 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 29)\nNEED TO PREPARE THE STUMP BEFORE FITTlNG AN ARTIFICIAL LEG\nOne of the workshop participants had lost his leg due to a land mine. The group made plans to create a make-shift limb out of bamboo or PVC (plastic pipe) for him. (Designs and\ninstructions for both types of limbs can be found in the book, Disabled Village Children.)\nHowever, when a leg-making team from the Swedish Red Cross visited the workshop, they brought a fully adjustable, low-cost prosthesis (artificial\nlimb) created from local materials. Both the socket and the length of the leg could be quickly modified to fit different persons.\nThis limb had a laced leather socket attached to a thin steel tube. The length of the tube could be adjusted by a simple telescoping mechanism.\nThe Red Cross team attempted to fit the limb to the amputee in the workshop. However, they ran into a problem. In the 3 years since his amputation,\nthe man had developed contractures and muscle weakness in the hip. Also, the stump was swollen and flabby. All of this made accurate fitting and\nsafe weight-bearing on the adjustable limb impossible.\nFrom this failed attempt, participants realized that an artificial limb is only a part of the rehabilitative need of an\namputee. In the period between losing the limb and getting a prosthesis, it is important that the person:\n1. Do exercises to maintain strength and prevent contractures, and\n2. Keep the stump bandaged, to prevent swelling and puffiness.\nAn instruction sheet on stretching and strengthening exercises (partly adapted from the book, Disabled Village Children)\nwas developed by the workshop facilitators. It was given to all participants so that they could work with other amputees in the different centers. That\nway, when there was an opportunity to get an artificial limb, the chances for successful fitting and use would be greater.\nTHE ENORMOUS NEED FOR ARTIFICIAL LIMBS - AND AN END TO VIOLENCE\nEveryone agreed that there was a great need for dozens of small, decentralized limbmaking workshops in the provinces, preferably with disabled persons as technicians. Today,\nAngola has tens of thousands of amputees waiting for limbs. Although the war has more-or-less ended, hundreds of thousands of land mines still cover the landscape. So thousands of\nmen, women, and children will continue to have their legs blown off.\nWorkshop participants realized that the only long-term answer is to outlaw land mines by international law. But that would be just a beginning. Corporate rule, and the power of the\nmultinational arms industry must also be confronted, as well as the unfair distribution of wealth and power that leads to so much poverty, crime, internal strife, and institutionalized\nviolence. Disabled people need to join with other marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the struggle for a kinder, fairer world. (See the book, Questioning the Solution for\nmore on the politics of health and disability. See page 344.)\nLearning From and Admitting Our Mistakes\n8 of 12\n2/17/2007 9:29 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 29)\nThe illustrated instruction sheet shown below was developed at the Angola workshop. Copies were made for participants to take back to their centers, to help persons who had lost a leg\nmaintain the movement and strength needed to successfully use an artificial leg, if and when they got one. (Another information sheet gave instructions on how to bandage the stump, to\nprevent the swelling and flabbiness that make it hard to fit a limb.)\nUnfortunately, the original exercise sheet, although it was designed by rehabilitation professionals, had some problems. The mistakes were pointed out to me, years later, by Ann\nHallum, an outstanding physical therapist who reviewed the manuscript of this book.\nQuestion: Some of the exercises shown below should usually be done differently, or not be done at all. Do you know which ones? And why?\nAnswer: CAUTION with exercises 1, 3, and 4.\nExercises 1, 3, and 4 should be done differently. They can lead to muscle imbalances and contractures that make walking with\nan artificial limb much more difficult.\nAfter the loss of a leg, the person tends to hold his stump lifted up and out, like this.\nBy doing this, he uses and strengthens the muscles that bend the stump up and out, more than those that bend it in and\nback. This results in a muscle imbalance that can lead to contractures that will interfere with walking.\nTherefore, it is best to do exercises to strengthen the weaker muscles that can help combat contractures. And\nstretch (but do not strengthen) muscles that contribute to contractures.\nTo combat contractures, Exercise 1 should be done to stretch, not strengthen. Exercises 3 and 4 should be done lying\ndown (to reduce flexion contractures of thigh). And if you do exercise 3, avoid opening the thigh to the side past\nmid-line.\nA corrected version of this exercise sheet is shown on the next page ...

Wheelchair Riders!\nEverest and Jennings is the brand name of the world's largest wheelchair manufacturer. Many people do not realize that the original designer and founder\nof this global wheelchair business was disabled and rode a wheelchair himself. The original \"E&J\" wheelchair - which was a breakthrough in its day\ngrew out of a disabled person's creative response to an unmet personal need.\nBut as E&J Industries grew, the company became more interested in mass-production than in innovation. Fortunately, however, other disabled persons\nhave continued to advance the state of the art. Like Herbert Everest, many of the most innovative wheelchair designers in the past 20 years have\nthemselves been wheelchair riders.\nRALF HOTCHKISS AND THE WHIRLWIND\nOne of the world's most caring and creative wheelchair designers and builders is Ralf Hotchkiss, who lives in California, USA.\nRalf became paraplegic (paralyzed from his chest down) from a motorcycle crash when he was a teenager. Since then, Ralf\ntrained as a mechanical engineer, and has designed and built a wide range of innovative wheelchairs and other equipment.\nWhen Ralf first decided to build a 4-wheel drive wheelchair, he had a hard time figuring a way to transfer power from the\nlarge back wheels to the small front wheels. The obvious solution was to use bicycle chains. But for this, the front wheels\nwould need to not swivel (pivot) to make turns, as do caster wheels of most wheelchairs.\n1 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nFurthermore, caster wheels need to be fairly small to avoid bumping the footrests when they pivot. But, to move easily on\nrough ground, Ralf's front wheels needed to be relatively large. What to do???\nThe solution, Ralf explains, came from the Bible: the so-called Ezekiel Wheel, a circle of small wheels that together form a larger wheel.\nWith this idea, Ralf created a front wheel made of a series of small rubber cones, positioned in a circle around the central hub. Each cone is\nmounted on its own ball bearings, so it can roll sideways, while the wheel as a whole rolls forward. This combination of several small wheels\nwithin a bigger one gives a multi-directional roll similar to that of a caster wheel. However, the forward direction of the main wheel is fixed and it\ndoes not pivot. This is what Ralf needed for his 4-wheel drive.\nLow-Cost, High-Quality Wheelchairs Made by Third World Riders\nAlthough Ralf's 4-wheel drive wheelchair worked well, it never became popular. Building it was too costly and time consuming. Just the front wheels used 24 bearings and 20\nindividually vulcanized cones.\nRalf's interest turned to developing low-cost wheelchairs for the Third World, using \"appropriate technology.\" His incentive was sparked on a visit to Nicaragua in 1980, shortly after\nthe Sandinistas overthrew the Somoza dictatorship. A group of young Sandinistas who had been spinal-cord injured during the war had formed a grassroots group called Organization\nof Disabled Revolutionaries (ORD). They had so much trouble getting wheelchairs that four of their members were sharing a single wheelchair. Most wheelchairs in Nicaragua were\nimported from the USA. With the stiffening US embargo, both chairs and spare parts were very hard to find. The ORD members had difficulty reintegrating into society and finding\nwork because they lacked mobility. Some, whose wheelchairs had broken down, had gone back to dragging themselves about in their homes, unable to leave.\nFor these reasons, the Disabled Revolutionaries set up a small wheelchair repair shop. But they ran into problems. Commercial imported chairs, such as E&Js, have poor-quality\nbearings which wear out quickly in a rough, dusty environment. Because they are not a standard size, they could only be replaced with over-priced bearings purchased from the original\nmanufacturer. The cost was prohibitive. In places like Nicaragua, where bearings of any kind are often not available, wheelchair maintenance becomes extremely difficult.\nClearly, such dependence on expensive, hard-to-maintain, imported chairs increased people's handicaps. Ralf worked with ORD to design a low-cost\nwheelchair that could be built from local materials by modestly-skilled disabled workers. The result was the Torbellino, or Whirlwind Wheelchair.\nWithin a year, ORD was operating a mini-factory in which a team of disabled persons built this home-grown design.\nTHE WHIRLWIND WHEELCHAIR is relatively easy to build in a modestly-equipped shop. Yet its quality is excellent. As a wheelchair rider\nhimself, Ralf appreciates the need for a light-weight, compact, easy-rolling, trouble-free chair. The design of the Whirlwind is simple and\nstream-lined, but a great deal of skillful engineering has gone into it.\nThe frame of the chair is made from electric-conduit steel tubing, available in building supply stores around the\nworld. The back wheels are bicycle wheels. The bearings (of the early model) are standard high-speed bearings used\nin small electric machinery. Used bearings can often be obtained at very low cost in electrical repair shops. These are\n2 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nfinely made bearings for high speed use. Even secondhand ones, used in a wheelchair, will long outlast commercial\nwheelchair bearings.\nThe beauty of the Whirlwind is that it is made in small community shops by disabled people who recognize the need for a chair that is adapted\nto the needs of the individual rider.\nThese wheelchairs tend to be custom-built or adapted. In the process, new design opportunities arise, and the chairs come closer to matching the varied\nneeds of their users.\nThe long-term vision:\nWHEELCHAIRS FOR ALL WHO NEED THEM\nSince helping ORD in Nicaragua, Ralf has traveled around the world, facilitating workshops and helping groups of disabled persons begin to produce appropriate wheelchairs. One of\nthe first groups he worked with was PROJIMO, in the mountains of Western Mexico. Over the years, Ralf has led workshops and worked with disabled wheelchair builders in 30\ncountries in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Russia.\nRalf calculates that, of the 20 million people in the Third World today who need wheelchairs, fewer than one percent have them. He dreams of the day when all who need a\nwheelchair will have a chair fully suited to their needs. To this end, he and his friend, Peter Pfaelzer at San Francisco State University, formed Wheeled Mobility, a small non-profit\norganization which is rapidly turning into an international network of wheelchair builders and designers. If there are ever to be enough wheelchairs - chairs that are truly liberating\nto their riders - production must be decentralized and the building process must be demystified, with users leading the process.\nRECENT WHIRLWIND INNOVATIONS\nThe basic design of the Whirlwind keeps evolving. Not only has Ralf continued to design and test new features himself, but he has gathered new\nideas from groups of disabled persons around the world who are building local variations of the Whirlwind.\nIt should be noted that many of these new features were developed in collaboration with disabled persons who expressed difficulties with the\nexisting design or who wanted some particular modification.\nIn this book, we do not give detailed instructions for making the Whirlwind wheelchair. A brief description can be found in the book, Disabled\nVillage Children. Very detailed instructions - including suggestions for setting up and stocking a shop - are in Ralf's fine handbook, Independence\nThrough Mobility (see page 343).\nFor years, Ralf has been revising and updating this book, but new ideas come so fast that it is a never-ending process. In this chapter we will give a\npreview of just a few of the most innovative modifications and improvements of the Whirlwind chair. While developed primarily for the\nWhirlwind, most of these innovations can be adapted to other models, or even to commercial wheelchairs.\n1. Front Wheels and Tires\nThe front caster wheels and tires of the Whirlwind have presented some big design challenges. Caster wheels are complex and costly. They\n3 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nrequire two sets of bearings, one vertical and one horizontal, so that the wheels can swivel, as well as rotate. (The swivel is what allows the chair\nto make turns.)\nThe basic front-caster design and the wheel forks remain much the same as in Ralf's original book (and in Disabled Village Children). A new\ndesign for bearings is discussed under entry #2. Here, we look at innovations in wheels and tires.\nFRONT WHEELS AND TIRES TO SUIT DIFFICULT TERRAIN:\nA THORNY PROBLEM\nMost modern commercial wheelchairs now come with tiny, hard, rubber or plastic front wheels. These are good for gliding over hospital floors or\nsmooth, paved streets. But they function poorly on the rough, sandy paths of villages, or on the pitted, irregular roads of many Third World cities.\nFor difficult or sandy terrain, front wheels need to be relatively big (6 to 9 inches in diameter) and wide (1+1/2 inches or more).\nPneumatic tires (filled with air, under pressure) are light-weight, and on rough terrain they give a much smoother ride (which may add to the life\nof the wheelchair - and the rider).\nBut air-filled tires also have short-comings. On rocky or thorny paths they puncture easily and often need to be patched and pumped up. Also,\npneumatic tires that fit small caster wheels tend to be outrageously expensive. And, in many countries, they are simply not available. In the original\nversion of Independence Through Mobility, Ralf gave an address in China where pneumatic tires and tubes can be bought in large quantities at\nrelatively low cost. But this is hardly an ideal solution for equipment designed to use local, easily obtained materials.\nThe wheels have presented another problem. In the early Whirlwind design, Ralf recommended making front wheels from two discs of hard wood,\nglued together, with their grain crossing (at right angles) to prevent splitting. The photos of the Whirlwind, below and on p.195, show the wooden\nwheels.\n4 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nThese wooden wheels were tried at PROJIMO in Mexico, but many users found them unsatisfactory. In spite of attempts to waterproof them with\nheavy varnish or epoxy finish, in the mud and rain they soon rotted and cracked. Riders in other countries reported similar problems. Another\nproblem was that some people who wanted to purchase a wheelchair thought wooden wheels were primitive and ugly. They insisted on having\n\"modern\" wheels, even if more costly. Whatever the reasons, such preferences must be taken into account.\nMolded aluminum wheels were another alternative considered by Ralf. Workshops in Brazil and Bangladesh cast and lathe-turn their own\naluminum wheels. But for most small production centers, this is impractical. The set-up costs are prohibitive.\nA rubber T tire, clamped between metal plates. A new design came from RESCU, a production center in Zimbabwe where disabled workers\nbuild assistive equipment, including the Whirlwind wheelchair. The front wheels consist of two round sheet-metal plates which grip a molded\nrubber tire.\nThe tire, in cross section, is T-shaped. The center-arm of the T projects inward, and is firmly held with bolts between\nthe 2 metal plates. The tire is vulcanized (heat-molded) in a specially lathe-turned steel mold. Once the mold is made,\nany shop that retreads car tires can produce these T-tires in small or large quantities at a relatively low cost.\nThe wheel is made by cutting two round disks of sheet metal. The disks must be widely separated at the center to hold\nthe hub firmly, and shaped so they can grip the T-tire. A dye of lathe-turned steel is needed to hammer, press or spin\nthe disks into shape.\nThe advantage of this Zimbabwe wheel is that, after a (fairly costly) initial investment for\nthe molds and dyes, the production cost can be quite low. The tire, made of the same\nrubber as a car tire, is nearly indestructible. Its broad, T-shaped base has almost the same\nflexibility and springiness as a pneumatic tire. But it never punctures. Wider tires can be\nmade for sand, to prevent sinking in.\n5 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nProblem: In Zimbabwe, the wheel was made of fairly thick sheet metal, pressed into shape in a large metal-press delivering tons of weight. In redesigning the wheel for smaller shops\nwithout such massive presses, Ralf began to experiment with a thinner grade of sheet-metal that could be hammered into shape when the metal disk was clamped over a dye. The\nPROJIMO wheel-chair builders tried making these wheels. At first, they appeared to work well. But, after repeated bumps into rocks and curbs, the metal disks bent and finally\ncollapsed. The PROJIMO team tried using thicker sheet-metal, but it was too difficult to hammer into shape. Groups experimenting in other countries ran into similar problems.\nSolution: An all-rubber wheel and tire. After exploring many possibilities, Ralf found a simple solution. Do away with the sheet-metal disks and mold the\nentire tire and wheel out of vulcanized rubber, as a single unit.\nThe central part of the wheel is cast thick enough to make it inflexible. The wide outer-edge that rolls against the ground is thin\nenough to provide a spongy flexibility.\nThe wide center-part of the wheel is molded to grip the hub. A flange, welded to the hub, is bolted to the wheel.\nA big advantage to this all-rubber wheel is that it bends easily, to ride smoothly over irregular terrain. These simplified wheels show\ngreat promise. Eventually, they may be used for both front and rear wheels of all-terrain wheelchairs.\n2. Bearings\nAmong the biggest problems with many wheelchairs are the bearings. Commercial chairs use off-size ball bearings of relatively poor quality. They soon wear out, making the wheels\nwobbly and hard to push. Since the bearings are not a common size, often they cannot be replaced locally, but must be obtained at high cost from the wheelchair supplier or the\nmanufacturer. Where chairs are imported, this may be very difficult or impossible. The Third World is littered with carcasses of fancy imported chairs whose bearings wore out.\nFor this reason, the original Whirlwind design uses local, widely available bearings. If dust or dirt get into the\nbearings, it can ruin them. So, sealed bearings are recommended. Though more costly, the user saves money in\nthe long run. Second-hand high-speed, sealed bearings of a workable size (5/8 inch inside diameter, 1+3/8\ninch outside diameter - or 15 x 35 mm metric equivalent) can often be found in junk yards (in starter motors of\nold cars) or in small motor or power tool repair shops. (For more details, see Independence Through Mobility.)\nProblem: When PROJIMO began making wheelchairs, it could get all the second-hand bearings it needed free\nor at low cost from friendly repair shop owners in the closest cities. But as the program produced more and\nmore chairs, the repair shops ran out of second-hand bearings. PROJIMO had to buy new bearings, which\nwere very expensive. The 12 sets of bearings needed for a wheelchair cost as much as all the remaining\nmaterials! This pushed up the price so much that many poor families could not afford it. Many other\nwheelchair-making shops have had a similar experience.\nWhirlwind hub design showing fit of bearings.(from Independence\nThrough Mobility, p.82)\nSolution: An idea to solve this problem came from India. On a visit there, Ralf Hotchkiss inspected the huge wheels of the traditional ox carts.\nThey used an ancient form of rod bearing, or \"needle bearings.\" The wheels rolled on a series of metal rods which fit snugly between the iron\nhub and the axle.\nRalf experimented with hubs that, instead of ball bearings, use metal rods that roll between the axle and\nthe hub tube. But the rods sometimes jammed in the hub.\n6 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nAn old mountain farmer in the eastern USA solved this problem by showing Ralf that thinner rods in a\nlonger hub do not jam. Ralf now uses carpenter's nails with their heads cut off. The nails form a circle of\nrollers between the axle bolt and metal hub tube.\nRalf has tested the ease with which the wheels turn compared to ball bearings, and finds them equal. The cost of materials for rod bearings is a fraction of\nthat of commercial ball bearings. Rod bearings require more work, but durability tests indicate that they last many times longer. (Whereas ball bearings bear\nthe weight of chair and rider on a tiny point on each tiny ball, with rods, the weight - and wear - is spread over the full length of the rods.)\nThese new (though ancient) bearings show great promise. Hopefully they will contribute toward providing high-quality, long-lasting wheelchairs to many of\nthe millions of people who need them, at a cost more within their reach.\n3. Folding Mechanism, with Adjustable Chair Width\nDifferent adjustments on wheelchairs. People who ride wheelchairs come in all shapes and sizes. So should wheelchairs. Many commercial chairs\nalthough the basic models are standardized - come with adjustable footrests, armrests, and alternative positions for the rear hubs.\nHub position. By changing the up-and-down position of the hubs in relation to the chair, the height and tilt of the seat can be changed. By changing the\nfront-to-back position of the hubs, the balance of the chair can be changed. For example, a person without legs may need the rear hubs mounted farther\nback to avoid falling over backwards when going up-hill.\n7 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nAn advantage to producing wheelchairs in small, community-based shops is that often they can be custom-made. Rather than adding a lot of mechanisms for adjustments to meet\ndifferent user's needs (which add to both weight and cost), each chair can be personalized from the start, to meet the specific needs of the intended user. If the wheelchair makers are\nalso wheelchair riders, they are likely to be more aware of and responsive to those needs, and to include the user in the planning and design process.\nNevertheless, even in a small community shop, some amount of standardization can make production quicker, easier, and cheaper. It helps to have a selection of ready-made chairs\navailable when they are needed. That way the person can try different chairs and pick the one that comes closest to meeting her or his needs. Last minute adjustments (or even more\nsubstantial changes) can then be made according to the individual's requirements.\nGoodness of fit - in terms of size, width, seat angle, angle and height of back, need for armrests, position of footrests, etc. - is\nessential. Decisions need to be made with the user, not for her, allowing enough time to test different alternatives and make\nwell-informed decisions.\nADJUSTABLE FEATURES OF THE WHIRLWIND. Although the Whirlwind has a basic (if evolving) design, it can be built\nand modified in different ways for different users. The height of the footrests can be easily adjusted by the user. Also, in\nresponse to his own need and that of others with spastic ankles, a PROJIMO wheelchair builder, Martin Perez (see Chapters 37\nand 39), has designed a simple way to adjust the sideways angle of the footrests.\nOne of the greatest needs for adjustability in wheelchairs is the width of the seat, and thereby the width of the whole chair.\nCorrect width is important for the stability and comfort of the rider, and for her ease in pushing the chair. A new design for easy\nadjustment of chair width has been developed, together with a new mechanism for folding the chair.\nA chair that is too wide is hard to push. (From\nIndependence Through Mobility, page 26)\nFolding is important. For many wheelchair riders, it is essential that their chair can fold, to fit into a narrow space. This is especially important for those who need to travel in a bus,\ncarry their chair in the back of a car, or pack it on a donkey.\nProblem: The original Whirlwind design included an upright X-brace that folded like scissors, as do most commercial chairs. But to fold well, the\nmeasurements, welds, and alignment must be exact. In PROJIMO, as in many small shops run by disabled persons, many workers are still learning their\nskills. There are few highly skilled crafts-persons. The resulting wheelchairs were often very difficult to fold. Users expressed their frustration.\nSolution: a horizontal folding device. To solve this common problem, Ralf and friends experimented with alternative folding devices until they came\n8 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nup with one that was more fool-proof. The new design folds horizontally, rather than vertically. Although it has more pieces and uses more welds than\nthe X-brace, it requires less skill and precision to build, and gives consistently good results. PROJIMO now uses this new folding device in all its\nWhirlwind chairs, and has had fewer complaints.\nNarrowing the chair to get through doorways. On experimenting with the new folding mechanism, users discovered that they could easily\nnarrow the width of the chair while sitting in it. They pull the handle under the seat forward, and then pull the wheels in, closer to their body. This\noffered a solution to another big problem of wheelchair riders in many countries: getting through narrow doorways. (See Luz's story on page 17.)\nWith the new design, to go through a narrow door the user simply pulls the sides of the chair in against her hips, and\nrolls through. (With an X-brace, narrowing the chair is much harder, because it folds against gravity and the person's\nown weight holds it wide open.)\nAdjustable chair and seat width. The horizontal folding mechanism also lends itself to adjusting the seat width to\nmatch the hip-width of the user. Small holes can be drilled in the cross bars of the adjustment device, so that the chair\nwidth can be adjusted, depending on which set of holes the center bolt is passed through.\nUpholstery. To avoid having to make new upholstery with different measurements for different seat adjustments, Ralf has devised wrap-around seat and back-rest cloths that can be\nlaced up at different widths.\nThe patterns for the back-rest and seat are similar. They consists of one square just a little bigger than the desired size\nof the back-rest or seat, and another square, 4 times as big.\nHem the edges of both squares to prevent fraying. Then, fold the big square in half, and cut grooves as shown here. Sew\ntogether at all edges, except where the small square will be attached. Turn the resulting sack inside out, and sew on the\nsmall square. Make holes for lacing as shown.\n9 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nHow appropriate is the new folding mechanism and adjustable seat? The answer depends on who you ask. Wheelchair riders and users (including Ralf) have mixed feelings. One of\nthe beauties of the early Whirlwind design (with the vertical X-frame) is its simplicity, streamlined look, relatively few parts, and few welded joints (all of which contributed to the\nchair's low weight and low cost).\nThe new folding mechanism with its adjustable seat width solves a number of problems but sacrifices some of the Whirlwind's graceful look and adds a bit of weight. Some users like\nbeing able to adjust the chair to their own body width, and to narrow it easily to pass through narrow doorways. Other users think it \"looks funny\" and prefer the more conventional\nX-brace. (For some people, appearance is more important than function.)\nThe PROJIMO wheelchair builders are delighted because - although the new folding mechanism takes more welds and looks more complex - for them, it is easier to build successfully.\nThat is important. Designs must be appropriate for builders as well as users.\nThe search for better designs continues. Ralf's team is now experimenting with a folding mechanism developed by blacksmiths in Nyabondo, Kenya. This uses a vertical X-brace that is\neasier to build than is Ralf's original design.\nThere is always room for improvement.\nAnd improvements are always possible when builders and users work together creatively.\nThis Chapter continues to the NEXT page\nGo back to the CONTENTS\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nby David Werner\nPublished by\nHealthWrights\n10 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 30)\nWorkgroup for People's Health and Rights\nPost Office Box 1344\nPalo Alto, CA 94302, USA\nCopyright 1998 by David Werner\n11 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nPART FOUR\nWHEELS TO FREEDOM\nCHAPTER 31\nFor Long Runs on Lousy Roads:\nA Hand-Pumped Tricycle\nALEJANDRO'S CHANGING MOBILITY NEEDS\nALEJANDRO was 12 years old when he was shot through the spine by a policeman. The events surrounding this brutal incident will be briefly described in\nChapter 40, page 261, under the heading, \"Defense of Human Rights.\" Here, we will focus on Alejandro's changing mobility needs, and the equipment designed\nat PROJlMO to help him move about at the different stages of his rehabilitation and re-entry into community life.\nAlejandro first arrived at PROJIMO two months after his injury. For a child who was completely paralyzed from the mid-back down, he was in good spirits.\nAlthough he had been told he might never walk again, he was eager to get back into action. He progressed through using 3 forms of locomotion: a gurney, a\nwheelchair, and a tricycle.\nA GURNEY to Recover from Pressure Sores and Prevent Urinary Infections\nLike so many spinal-cord injured young people who come to PROJIMO, Alejandro already had deep pressure sores when he\narrived. The sores had begun to form while he was in the hospital. Therefore, his first mobility aid was a wheeled cot, or gurney\n(see Chapter 37). This allowed him to lie on his stomach, taking pressure off the sores on his butt. In the wheelchair shop, the\ngurney was built to the boy's size.\nAt Alejandro's request, a simple rack to hold a container with drinking water was made from a plastic gallon bottle and\nattached to the front of the gurney. Handy access to drinking water is essential, especially in a hot climate, because one of the\nbest ways to prevent bladder and kidney infection is to drink lots and lots of water. For Alejandro to have his own water\ncontainer (with its attached plastic straw) within easy reach wherever he went, was an important (and possibly life-saving)\nmeasure.\nThe gurney had another feature to help prevent urinary infections: a built in free-flow urinal (see next page).\nWith spinal-cord injury, the person usually loses bladder (and bowel) control. To get the urine out and prevent\n1 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nwetting the clothing, a catheter (thin tube) is often used. Whenever possible, however, it is important that\nspinal-cord injured persons avoid using a permanent (Foley) catheter (see box at right). If the catheter is left in continuously, it is likely to cause urinary infections (see page 147).\nWARNING: For persons with a spinal-cord injury (or spina bifida),\npressure sores and urinary infections are the most common causes of death,\nTo help Alejandro keep dry, and yet avoid the need for a permanent catheter, his gurney had a hole cut out of it in the\nposition of his genitals. This way, he could urinate into a container hanging under the gurney, without needing a\npermanent catheter. (The hole also prevents injuring the genitals, which, because they lack feeling, can be easily injured.)\nGurneys can be built with a potty or other removable container attached under the hole in the gurney. Or, a large funnel\ncan be mounted under the hole, with a plastic tube that drains into a urine bag.\nA Wheelchair to Take Part in Village Life\nPartly because he was so active on his gurney, Alejandro's large pressure sores healed quickly. Within 2 months, he was ready for a wheelchair. He\nexperimented with different models at PROJIMO until he had an idea of what would work best for him. The wheelchair builders then took his\nmeasurements and built a version of the Whirlwind wheelchair (see Chapter 30). In his new chair, Alejandro was extremely active, and he took\npart in a wide variety of adventures with other youth in the village, including swimming in the river.\nAt first, Alejandro used an air-filled cushion on his wheelchair to prevent pressure sores. But even with the cushion (and in spite of repeated advice\nfrom Mari and others to often lift his butt off the seat) Alejandro began to develop new sores.\nHis younger brother, Neto, with guidance from the PROJIMO team, helped him make a personalized\ncushion out of layers of cardboard glued together with white glue (see Chapter 27). Before the glue was\ndry, they sprinkled the cardboard with water to make it softer. Then, Alejandro sat on the cushion so that it would take the shape of his\nbackside. Finally, they cut an oval out of the back part of the cushion to further reduce pressure over the butt-bones where the pressure sores\noften form. To make the cushion softer, they covered it with a layer of fairly dense foam rubber. The whole thing slipped into a protective cloth\npillowcase.\nWith his cardboard cushion - plus daily treatment of the sores with honey and sugar, and remembering to shift his weight regularly -\nAlejandro's sores healed rapidly.\n2 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nTime passed ... When Alejandro first came to PROJIMO, the team had realized that the treatment of his pressure sores would take months. Because proper management of his sores at\nhome was unlikely, they arranged for him to stay in Ajoya (where PROJIMO is based) and to attend the village school. For a time he did well, but eventually he dropped out and got\nmarried to a girl of his own age (14 years old). He took his young wife to his parents home, but life was difficult. His parents drank a lot and neither was employed. Often the family\nwent hungry. Alejandro began to think of how he and his young wife could have a better future.\nA TRICYCLE to Continue Schooling\nFortunately for Alejandro and his family, PROJIMO has relations with Liliane Fonds, a non-government charity in Holland that assists\nindividual disabled children and their families. Liliane knows that a family's economic survival is basic to a disabled child's survival and\nwell-being. A little \"seed money\" from Liliane helped the family begin to earn a living through the informal economy. Marcelo, at\nPROJIMO, built a metal cart for frying and selling tacos, which the family could put on a street corner in the evening and earn a modest\nincome.\nLater, Liliane financed a strong, pedal-powered tricycle with a big carriage area. With this,\nAlejandro's brothers (who could find no formal employment) rode through the city streets\ncollecting old cardboard, aluminum cans, and scrap metal. They could sell these for enough to put\na bit of food on the family table.\nEven so, sometimes there was not enough to eat. In Mexico, as in so many countries,\nunemployment increases and wages decline as the gap between rich and poor continues to widen. Unable to do many forms of physical\n\"unskilled\" labor, Alejandro began to think about returning to school.\nDolores Mesina - a big-hearted social worker who had polio as a child and has close ties with PROJIMO (see page 261) - arranged for\nAlejandro (at age 16) to get a scholarship to a technical school. Alejandro could study practical skills there, ranging from small-motor repair\nto secretarial and computers skills. He was eager to attend.\nHowever, there was a major difficulty: how to get there. The school was on the far side of the city, 5 kilometers away. Buses were not equipped to take wheelchairs, and they were\nterribly crowded. Taxis were too costly. The roads were too rough and the traffic too heavy for travel in his wheelchair to be safe.\nAlejandro thought of a solution for getting to the distant school: a hand-powered tricycle. Geoff Thomsby, a wheelchair builder with\nexperience in Africa, had volunteered at PROJIMO for over a year. He had taught the PROJIMO workers to build a hand-pumped tricycle\nthat he had developed from models used in Cameroon, Africa. While at PROJIMO, Alejandro had tried out a tricycle, and loved it. With its\nlarge size and big front wheel, it zoomed safely over uneven terrain. For long distance travel, the rider could keep up a relatively high speed\nwithout tiring nearly as much as with a regular wheelchair, even a \"Whirlwind.\"\nAgain Liliane Fonds assisted with the costs. Alejandro went back to PROJIMO and helped to repair a used tricycle, which the team agreed to\nlet him have at a reduced price. The fact that Alejandro himself helped repair the tricycle gave him both the knowledge and the responsibility\nfor its upkeep. Alejandro now cruises all over the city of Mazatlan, visiting friends and attending social gatherings. The tricycle has been\nAlejandro's ticket to a new level of freedom.\n3 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nHAND-POWERED TRICYCLES\nStrengths and Weaknesses\nAlthough hand-powered tricycles are widely used in Asia and Africa, they are little-known in most of Latin America. But there is certainly a need for them.\nThe main advantages of the tricycle are that its large front wheel, large size, and hand-power mechanism (whether by crank or pump) permit easier, faster safer travel over rough\nterrain.\nThe tricycle is most useful for disabled people with specific needs, such as:\nPersons, like Alejandro, who travel long distances to school or work on rough roads or in heavy traffic.\nPersons with only one hand strong enough to push a wheelchair - such as those with one-sided paralysis.\nPeople who can walk short distances, with or without crutches, but need wheels for going longer distances.\nDisadvantages. The tricycle is not ideal for every rider's needs. Its large size (length and width) makes it unfit for indoor use (or for bus travel).\nAt PROJIMO the two workers who at once fell in love with the tricycle were Armando and Inez. Both use crutches. Although\nArmando walks with crutches in the wheelchair shop, he enjoys using the tricycle to move about in the village. It is easier for him than a\nwheelchair, because one arm (as well as both legs) is weak from polio. He powers the tricycle with his stronger arm, and steers it with his\nweaker one.\nInez's arms are both strong. But he lives at the far end of the village, a long distance away on crutches. The tricycle gets him there\nquickly. It is big and strong enough so he can give his two young daughters a ride on it, which they love.\n4 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nA Tricycle and Dignity for Don Miguel\nA person who found the tricycle wheelchair especially enabling was DON MIGUEL. Don Miguel (who recently died) was an elderly man who had come to PROJIMO with a huge,\nopen sore (ulcer) on one leg. The lack of feeling and scars from burns on his hands and feet gave the clue that he had Hansen's disease (leprosy). At first he denied this. But, later, he\nadmitted that he had undergone treatment for the disease.\nThe ulcer needed long-term treatment, and the leg needed to be kept elevated (higher than the level of his heart) when he was not physically active. So, Don Miguel was invited to spend\nan extended period of time at PROJIMO, for treatment and rehabilitation.\nIn truth, Don Miguel's biggest need was to feel respected and needed. Because of people's fear and lack of correct information about leprosy, he had been rejected wherever he went.\nHis relatives occasionally helped him with a little money, but preferred that he keep his distance. He had a kindness and wry sense of humor about him, born of loneliness. A good man,\nbut misunderstood.\nIn PROJIMO, Don Miguel found a new family: people who welcomed and accepted him. Why a group of disabled persons should be more accepting of someone with leprosy than most\nother people, is hard to say. Perhaps it was because they, too, have felt rejected, slighted - or worst of all, pitied - for their various disabilities. Stigma is stigma.\nIn PROJIMO, Don Miguel discovered not only that he was welcome, but needed! Though he had arthritic pain secondary to his disease, he was more able-bodied than many PROJIMO\nworkers. He began helping in any way he could, He moved and bathed persons in need of assistance. And he took over the maintenance of the grounds and playground.\nThere was always a lot of garbage to clean up. This Don Miguel would do religiously every morning. But moving about was difficult for him. One day, he asked if he could use a\ntricycle. Everyone said yes. To help him with the clean-up, the wheelchair builders made a large cart which could be attached to the back of the tricycle, like a trailer. Don\nMiguel would ride around the grounds, getting out here and there to put trash into the cart.\nDon Miguel stayed at PROJIMO for nearly two years ... the last two of his life. He was a good influence on the team, a peacemaker in times of strife. Everyone liked him. One day he\nsaid he was leaving, and a few weeks later the team learned from his family that he was dead. He had been a warm and stabilizing influence on the program.\nWe miss him.\nDesign and Construction of A Lever-Powered PROJIMO Tricycle\n5 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nThe PROJIMO tricycle is one of many different designs in different parts of the world. One feature of the PROJIMO tricycle that differs from many is its lever-powered drive. Most\ntricycles are powered by hand-rotated pedals (often modified bicycle pedals), and the power is transferred to either the front wheel or one of the back wheels by means of a bicycle\nchain. The problem with chains is that they can break fairly easily. The lever-powered drive mechanism is more resilient and requires less maintenance. Also, rear-wheel (rather than\nfront-wheel) drive provides better traction on sand and steep slopes.\nExamples of Different Tricycle Designs from Different Lands\nPersonal Transport for Disabled People - Design and\nAsia-Pacific Disability Aids and Appliances Handbook, Part 1:\nACTION ON DISABILITY AND\nManufacture\nMobility Aids, 1982\nDEVELOPMENT\nAHRTAG\nACROD / ICTA sub-commission\n23 Lower Keyford\nAppropriate Health Resources and Technologies Action\n18 Argyle Street\nFrome\nGroup.

Others are powered with both hands (in which case the steering mechanism and drive mechanism are usually on the same bar,\nattached to the front fork). Some have hand-powered drive pedals (handles) on both sides of the tricycle, so that when one of the rider's arms tires she can use the other. It is important to\npick the design that best meets the needs of the particular user. Booklets exist on different designs of tricycle wheelchairs. Some examples are shown here.

A world-wide information sharing network has been launched by a\ngroup called Appropriate Mobility International (AMI), based at Delft University of Technology, in Holland. Joep Verweij of AMI has collected information and photos on scores of\ntricycle designs from rich countries and poor, world-wide, He has assembled these in an Overview Report titled Inventory of Tricycle Models (see page 344). The wide diversity of\ndesign is a testimony to the creativity of disabled people and local craftspersons. Here are a few examples of this diversity, taken from the Inventory of Tricycle Models, and elsewhere:\n7 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nHigh-Tech Communications for Grass-Roots Shop Workers:\n\"Tricycle Production Manual,\" by the Folks at Appropriate Mobility International\nBased on their research and the design perspectives of tricycle users and designers from all over the world, folks at AMI and the Center for International Cooperation and Appropriate\nTechnology have put together a remarkable instruction manual. With hundreds of line drawings and very few words, the manual guides the reader through the steps of building an\nimproved model of a hand-operated tricycle.\nThe Table of Contents of the Manual uses the pictures shown below to indicate headings:\n1. TRICYCLE\n2. PRODUCTION\n3. ADDITIONS\n4. MATERIALS\n5.

As a result, many of the\ndrawings - which have been done with great precision with a computerized graphics program - are 3-dimensional, as\nshown right.\nThis innovative manual deserves careful study, not only by wheelchair builders, but by anyone interested in exploring new\nways of communicating clearly. Through the use of step-by-step series' of computerized drawings, it attempts to bridge the\ngap between sophisticated technology and the traditional skills of local craftspersons, whose understanding tends to be\nbased on real (or at least realistically drawn) objects rather than written words. (See Resource List #2, on page 344.)\nA CONVERTIBLE TRICYCLE-WHEELCHAIR FOR ALEJANDRO\nAt the time this book went to press, Alejandro had been offered a scholarship to study English at the Academia de Ingles Golden Gate, in his home city of Mazatlan. (The Academy is\nrun by a disabled youth, Jose Angel Tirado, whom PROJIMO assisted in his childhood. See page 315.) To get to the Academy on the rough, heavily trafficked roads, Alejandro could\nuse the sturdy tricycle made for him at PROJIMO. But this outdoor vehicle was much too big to move about inside the Academy or to enter a classroom.\nTherefore the PROJIMO team decided they should make a tricycle that Alejandro could quickly convert into an ordinary\nwheelchair for indoor use. Armando remembered seeing a design for such a tricycle in a booklet called Making Health Care\nEquipment (see page 343). It consisted of a standard wheelchair to which a tricycle front-end (including a large front wheel,\nhand pedals, and a steering mechanism) could be easily attached or removed.\n9 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nAlejandro thought that such a trike would meet his needs. For long distance rides on rough roads, he could use the full tricycle.\nOn arrival at the Academy (or at home) he could unplug the front section and enter the building in the compact wheelchair.\nFor this experimental model, Armando and Marcelo adapted a standard donated wheelchair. They used a 24-inch bicycle\nwheel at the front. They welded together a tube frame, with rods that could slip into the side tubes of the chair seat.\nNeed for improvements:\nAt the time of this writing, the experimental design had been built and tested, but still had problems. The chain that linked the hand crank to the front wheel occasionally jumped off the\nsprockets (which needed better alignment). Also, some sort of device or blocks were needed to hold the chair's caster wheels a couple of centimeters off the ground - so that Alejandro\ncan plug in or remove the tricycle unit while sitting in the chair.\nTricycle designs must be adapted to local needs. In urban Mexico, a standard tricycle is too long to fit into buildings and classrooms. In rural Africa, a standard tricycle is too wide to\nride on narrow dirt trails. An African boy's innovative solution is shown on the next page.\nPAFUPI BUILDS HIS OWN TRICYCLE FOR NARROW TRAILS\nPAFUPI lived in a remote village in Malawi, Africa. Because his legs were paralyzed by polio, he had started school later than most children. The school was too far away to walk to on\nhis braces and crutches. He dreamed of having a hand-powered tricycle. But the trails where he lived were much too narrow for the big, wide tricycles made in the cities.\nPafupi was good with his hands and had an inventive streak. As a child he had made a guitar from old tin cans and scraps of leather. And he had learned to play it fairly well.\nWhen he was 17, Pafupi decided to make a small tricycle that was narrow enough to ride on local trails. He used parts of 3 old bicycles, an old flywheel, and bits of scrap metal. He had\nno welding equipment. So he hammered the ends of the pieces together precisely, like interlocking fingers. Although the joints were slightly flexible, they were remarkably strong.\nOn his way home from school, Pafupi rides his improved \"narrow gauge\" tricycle, designed for the narrow trails. (See\nLeft)\nThe tools Pafupi used to make his tricycle were very basic: a small block of iron which he used as an anvil, 2 hammers,\nand a piece of an old hack-saw blade held in a curved metal pipe. (See Right)\n10 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 31)\nOn a trip to Malawi, Kennett Westmacott, an innovator of disability aids, saw Pafupi on his home-made\ntricycle. (In England, Kennett and his wife, Jean, run People Potential, where they teach ordinary people\nto design and make simple assistive devices. See pages 72 and 74). Fascinated by the appropriateness of\nPafupi's home-made tricycle, Kennett and his students tried to build one like it in a training workshop. But\ntheir modified version had problems. To get it to work well, the group had to rebuild the tricycle, closely\nfollowing Pafupi's design. Then they modified it with a bigger front wheel and other helpful changes.\nAn outstanding feature of Pafupi's tricycle was that he could pedal it in reverse (make it back up),\nsomething Kennett had not seen before in small, chain-driven tricycles.\nThe group was amazed that Pafupi - a viliage boy in primary school - was able to create such a\nwell-adapted and functional vehicle, all done with very simple tools and without welding. Their respect for\nthe skill and creativity of disabled villagers increased greatly.\nGo back to the CONTENTS\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nby David Werner\nPublished by\nHealthWrights\nWorkgroup for People's Health and Rights\nPost Office Box 1344\nPalo Alto, CA 94302, USA\nCopyright 1998 by David Werner\n11 of 11\n2/17/2007 9:30 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nPART FOUR\nWHEELS TO FREEDOM\nCHAPTER 32\nMobility Aids, a Walking Toilet,\nand a Seeing-Eye Person for Carlos\nCARLOS is the son of migrant farm workers from Oaxaca, one of the poorest states of Mexico. During harvesting season, his family used to come north to\nSinaloa (the state where PROJIMO is located) to pick tomatoes. When he was 8 years old, Carlos already worked with his parents in the fields. Sadly when he was\n10, the boy was hit by a truck and his brain was severely damaged. He remained mentally and physically disabled, and also visually impaired.\nMonths after his accident, Carlos was taken to PROJIMO by state social workers. While he was still in the hospital, his parents had abandoned him. Apparently\nthey had gone back to Oaxaca, without leaving an address. The social workers asked if PROJIMO could provide rehabilitation for the boy. In effect, PROJIMO\nbecame Carlos' new family.\nOn arrival, Carlos already had secondary physical and emotional problems. His spastic body had become very stiff, and he had contractures of his hips and knees.\nHe was almost totally blind, and his mind did not function well. He had very little short-term memory and difficulty learning even simple things. The few words he\nspoke were mostly abusive swear words. He got angry easily, and often cursed and spit at persons trying to help him. He would repeatedly plead \"I want water!\" or\n\"I want food!\" even when he had just had plenty to eat and drink. He constantly wet and pooped his clothing and bed.\nCarlitos (as he was affectionately called) needed a lot of personal assistance, plus a huge amount of understanding and patience. Fortunately, an older woman\nnamed Rosa, who has worked at PROJIMO for years, became like a mother to him. Rosa lovingly bathed him and washed his soiled clothes 2 or 3 times a\nday.\nMobility. To help Carlitos move himself about, one of the first things the shop-workers did was to build a wheelchair adapted to his size and needs. At first he\ncould not move his wheelchair at all. But, little by little, he learned to roll it about. In time, he could more or less find his way on the pathways between\nbuildings.\nWater Play as Therapy. In preparation for standing and walking, the team helped Carlitos with range-of-motion and\nstretching exercises. These helped to correct contractures and reduce the spasticity of his hips and knees. At first, he angrily\nresisted the exercises. But when the team tried working - and playing - with him in water, he loved it. The water supported his\nweight and let him move without the fear of falling. His pleasure and activity in the water seemed to help his stiff body to loosen up.\n1 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nStanding. Although Carlitos' knees still bent stiffly when he tried to stand, the team felt he had the potential for learning how to stand and walk. At first he was non-cooperative, and\nunderstandably so. After nearly a year without weight-bearing, standing hurt his feet. But with daily practice his feet toughened.\nThe team found that the best way to get Carlos to try to stand was to put him with another child who was learning to stand.\nWalking. When Carlitos first tried to stand at the parallel bars he had very poor balance. He practiced daily.\nLittle by little, his balance improved until he could take a few steps, holding onto the bars.\nAfter months of practice, he learned to walk back and forth between the bars with fair\nstability. When Carlos began to say \"I want walker!\" the team asked Jaime to design a\nwalker that would meet the boy's needs.\nMari and Inez tested him with walkers of different sizes and heights. At last they found\na combination of features that allowed him to stand straighter and more firmly. Jaime, a\nparaplegic wheelchair builder who works lying on a gurney (wheeled cot), built the\n2 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nwalker out of steel tubing. He used thin-wall electric conduit tubing, the same material\nused to make the wheelchairs.\nA Wooden Walker with a Seat\nCarlitos enjoyed walking with his new metal walker. But his attention span was brief and he tired quickly. After a few minutes, he would want to sit in his wheelchair. And a few\nminutes later, he would want to walk again. Because he was blind and had difficulty remembering, it was hard for him to find things. All day long he would call out to people to bring\nhim his walker or his wheelchair. When everyone was busy there was sometimes a delay, and he would get angry and frustrated. \"Carlos want walk NOW!\" he would wail.\nOne day, Juan, a disabled carpenter and brace-maker, asked Carlos, \"Carlitos, would you like a walker with a seat on it, so that you can sit down and rest when you're tired of walking?\"\n\"Yes\" said Carlos eagerly. \"Carlos want walker with seat.\" So Juan made him a unique wooden walker with a seat.\n3 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nAlthough transferring from his wheelchair to the wooden walker required stepping over the wooden bar that supported the seat, Carlos soon learned to transfer without help.\nWith his new walker, Carlos became more independent. He no longer needed to always ask people for help, and he began to take pride in doing things for himself. His self-help skills in\nwalking helped prepare him for a better response to toilet training (see p.212).\nA \"Seeing-Eye Person\" for Carlos. With his walkers, Carlos' walking improved. But being blind, he had a hard time finding his way. Someone suggested a seeing-eye dog. But it was\neasier to provide a \"seeing-eye person.\"\nAt PROJIMO there are always young wheelchair users who have trouble moving about by themselves. These include Tere and Lupita, who\nhave spastic arms and legs. One day, Tere was practicing standing at the parallel bars. At the same time, Carlos was walking in circles around\nthe outside of the bars, holding on with only one hand. To do this, Carlos had to circle around Tere's wheelchair. Once when he took hold of\nthe handles of her wheelchair, he laughed and tried to push it, like a walker. That gave Rosa an idea.\nA Wheelchair as a Walker. When Tere finished her standing session at the bars, she said she wanted to go to the laundry area to wash her\n4 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nclothes. Because she has difficulty moving her wheelchair on the uneven ground, she asked Rosa to push her. Half-joking, she said, \"Carlitos,\nwhy don't you push Tere to the laundry area?\"\nCarlos grinned with excitement. \"Yes! Carlitos want push Teresita!\"\nAt first Tere was reluctant. Although she and Carlos were friends, she feared he would wheel her into a\npit or tree. But Rosa explained to Tere that, by letting Carlos push her, she would be helping him with his\ntherapy, his independence, and his self-esteem. So Tere agreed to give it a try.\nRosa guided Carlos' hands to the handles of Tere's wheelchair. Carlos pushed it eagerly. To keep on\ncourse, Tere told the blind boy where to go. At first he was confused. But after a while he learned to tell\n\"Left!\" from \"Right!\" and steer accordingly. Carlos had never seemed so happy, nor Tere more scared.\nCarlos as a wheelchair-rider's attendant.\nBy that afternoon, Carlitos proudly also began to help Lupita move from one area of the playground to the other. He was walking more and better\nthan he had ever walked before. And he was able to find his way, thanks to his \"seeing eye persons.\" This mutual self-help by persons with\ndifferent disabilities helped to build self-confidence in all who were involved, Carlos took great pride in his new role as a \"wheelchair attendant.\"\nPeer therapy. Tere, likewise, took pleasure in knowing that she was helping Carlos both develop his walking skills and gain a sense of being\nuseful and appreciated. Lupita, whose mental handicap is as great as that of Carlos, was all smiles with the enthusiastic services of her newly\nfound driver. In this way, multiply disabled young people have learned to help one another.\nToilet Training as Preparation for Standing, Balance, and Manual Skills\nCarlos' toilet training advanced slowly, with modest gains. At first, he always pooped in his cot at night. Then he began occasionally to crawl off his cot and poop on the floor. To\nreinforce this response and take it further, Juan - with the help of two village school children - made a simple wooden toilet seat that could be placed over a bucket next to Carlos' cot.\nTo involve Carlos more with making his toilet, the group asked him if he wanted to help sand the wooden seat. Carlos, always eager to \"work,\"\nresponded, \"Yes, Carlos want sand toilet.\" Perhaps because he had already tried sitting on the toilet and identified it as his, he did the sanding with more\nenergy and persistence than usual.\nThe next step was practice using his toilet. This involved sitting on the edge of the bed, standing up (while holding a metal bed frame turned on its side\nat the head of the bed), unbuttoning and loosening his pants, lowering his pants enough to avoid soiling them (while leaning against the bed frame), and\nsitting on the toilet. After using the toilet, he learned to repeat the same steps in reverse.\nSteps in Carlos' toileting practice:\n5 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nCarlitos still has a long way to go until he has no accidents in his bed. But his bedside potty not only helps him with\ntoilet training, it also helps with standing, balance, dressing and undressing skills, body coordination, and manual\ndexterity. He is eager to learn new skills, and takes pride in having helped make the toilet he is learning to use.\nA WALKING TOILET FOR CARLOS\nProblem. Carlos' new walker-with-a-seat (described on page 210) allowed him to sit down when and where he wanted. But the design\nhad one big problem. Because the seat was mounted behind the space where he stood to push the walker, the whole device was over a\nmeter long. This made moving in close quarters very cumbersome. If Carlos was to learn to walk to the dining room, he needed a\nwalker that was more compact.\n6 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nTo solve this problem, PROJIMO designed a compact walker with the seat\nin front of him, not behind. Although he had to turn around to sit down, this walker had the advantage that it had no poles to\nstep over.\nAlso, it simplified transfers from the wheelchair. Carlos could wheel his wheelchair between the rear legs of the walker, take\nhold of the walker's handle-bars and easily stand up.\nAdaptation for urinating. One complication to having the seat of his walker in front of him was hygiene. Now that Carlos\nwas partly toilet-trained, to urinate he would simply stand up and lower his pants. With his old walker (with the seat behind)\nthat was all right. But to avoid wetting the forward-positioned seat of the new walker, the seat needed to be hinged so that\nCarlos could lift it out of the way before urinating.\nAdding a potty. The idea to adapt the walker as a portable toilet came from necessity. It was springtime. The plum trees at PROJIMO hung heavy\nwith fruit. The ripest plums fell to the ground. Carlos would park his walker in the shade of the trees, sit on the seat, and lean over to feel with his\nhands for the fallen fruit. In a short time, he would stuff his belly to bursting.\nBut this feast had a nasty side effect: diarrhea. Because Carlitos was blind and forgetful, he had not learned to take himself to the outhouse.\nSometimes, when he had to go in a hurry, he called someone to take him. And sometimes he would poop in his pants. Rosa, who had to bath him\nand wash his clothes, was at her wits end.\nTo solve this problem, Polo helped to convert Carlos' walker into a mobile toilet. He cut a hole in the seat to hold a plastic bowl. Supported by its\nrim, the bowl could be lifted out to empty it. To use as an ordinary seat, a square board, hinged at the back, could be lowered over the bowl. To\nurinate, Carlos could swing the whole toilet up out of the way.\n7 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nThe invention saved the day. From one day to the next, Carlos became more independent in his toileting. The stimulation caused by his high-plum diet gave him plenty of practice, and\nhe quickly learned to lift the lid and lower his pants.\nWhat he never learned to do was to empty his potty. We all learned - the hard way - about the need to empty Carlos' potty often enough,\nespecially during plum season.\nOne day, when he had filled his potty to the brim, he lost his bearings and fell over with his walker. He and the walker were covered with the\npotty's rank contents. Cecilia and the author helped with the clean up. It was no fun!\nBut, despite the occasional mishaps, Carlos loved his new walker. It not only gave him new freedom to move about, but helped him become\nmore fully self-sufficient with his toilet.\nImprovement\n8 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nBit by bit, in the 3 years that Carlos has been at PROJIMO, both his physical and mental abilities have improved. He has remembered songs from early childhood, and has learned new\nones. He now talks more cleverly, remembers people's names, gets angry less often, and laughs gladly in response to friendliness or assistance. His common phrases now include \"I want\nto walk\" and \"I want to work.\" He takes pride in using his toilet, and in staying dry and clean (sometimes).\nHis attention span is still brief, but for several moments at a time, he helps with activities in the toy shop. All in all - through\na team effort in which disabled persons help each other - Carlos has come a long way.\nMost important of all, Carlos has made friends and learned how to enjoy life and people.\nIn addition to better balance, he now has more self-confidence in his abilities. It was a day for celebration when, at last,\nCarlos began to stand without any support or assistance.\nThis Chapter continues to the NEXT page\nGo back to the CONTENTS\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nby David Werner\nPublished by\nHealthWrights\n9 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 32)\nWorkgroup for People's Health and Rights\nPost Office Box 1344\nPalo Alto, CA 94302, USA\nCopyright 1998 by David Werner\n10 of 10\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 33)\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nPART FOUR\nWHEELS TO FREEDOM\nCHAPTER 33\nBars for Beno, and a Walker\nthat Turns into Crutches for Lino\nThis chapter looks at walking aids, harmful and helpful, for two children with spina bifida: Beno and Lino.\nA Costly Walker for Beno that Did More Harm Than Good\nBENO was four-years-old when he proudly showed the PROJIMO team how well he could walk with his big new chrome-plated walker. A month before\nhis family (from a fishing village near the coastal city of Mazatlan) had taken him to a rehabilitation hospital where a doctor had prescribed the giant\nwalker. It had cost the family a third of its year's earnings. But was it good for Beno?\nMari and Conchita had their doubts. The big square walker had a sling seat. To push it, the boy sat leaning forward with his hips bent almost at a right angle\nto his back. This was not a desirable position for a child with spina bifida, like Beno.\nA child with spina bifida (page 131) often has weak muscles in the lower back and hips. This weakness is likely to lead to hip contractures that\nprevent the hips from straightening. As a result, many of these children have trouble standing up straight (or even lying down straight). Their butt\ntends to stick out backwards. If they will ever be able to walk upright and independently, they need exercises, activities, and assistive equipment\nthat help stretch and straighten the hips.\nBeno's big metal walker did just the opposite. Taking steps while seated in it, he was crouched in a position that would add to hip contractures, not\nprevent them! Also, walking in a sitting position prevented Beno from bearing weight on his legs, which is important for bone growth and muscle\ndevelopment.\nMari and Conchita explained all this to Beno's parents, and advised them not to let Beno continue using the walker.\nParallel bars. As an alternative, Conchita adjusted the parallel bars in the playground high enough so that\nwhen Beno walked between them, they helped him to stretch his hips and to stand as straight up as possible. The parallel bars, which were made\nout of poles from the forest, had the advantage that the family could build their own at home at almost no cost.\nLater, PROJIMO workers designed a wooden walker for Beno to help him stand as upright as possible and stretch his hip-flexor muscles. (An\nunusual walker for another child with spina bifida is illustrated on the next page.)\n1 of 3\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 33)\nA Low-Cost Crutch-Walker for Lino\nLINO, like Beno, was born with spina bifida. The defect in his spinal cord was sufficiently low on his back (near his butt) that he had fair upper leg strength.\nThis meant he had a good chance of learning to walk, first perhaps with a standing board (parapodium) and then with a walker and perhaps crutches.\nIf a child with spina bifida is to be able to walk with crutches, or possibly without them, it is important that, from early\nchildhood, every effort be made to prevent hip-flexion contractures. Care should be taken to keep the hip joints extended as\nstraight as possible by means of exercises, positioning, and appropriate assistive devices.\nBecause of weak lower back and hip muscles, the child with spina bifida\nis likely to find it hard to stand independently.\nSome of these children learn to stand by thrusting their hips forward and\ntheir upper body backwards, so that their center of gravity is behind the\nhips. But to stand this way, it is essential that hip-flexion contractures be\nprevented (or corrected). In fact, it helps if the hip joints over-extend,\nor bend farther back than a simply straight position.\nLino was fortunate because, since early childhood, his family helped\nwith exercises and positioning to keep his hips fully flexible. When he\nwas three, PROJIMO helped him start to use a walker, with confidence\nthat he would soon \"graduate\" to walking with crutches.\nIn designing a walker for Lino, Marcelo - an innovative shop-worker at PROJIMO\nrecalled his own childhood as a boy with both legs paralyzed by polio. Many disabled children who are learning to walk first use a walker and then, when they become\na little more stable, change to crutches. For many children, the transition from walker to crutches is a fearful and traumatic experience. The walker gives them\nsubstantial stability. Crutches, at first, tend to wobble all over. In learning to use them, the terrified child often loses his balance and takes some nasty falls.\nFor this reason, Marcelo designed for Lino a walker that could gradually be converted into crutches, with no sudden and frightening transition. The walker\nconsisted of 2 forearm crutches, which were connected with cross struts held in place with bolts and butterfly nuts. This way, the bolts could be gradually loosened to\nmake the walker more wobbly and less stable. Then one after another of the cross-pieces and back-supports could be removed, until only the crutches were left.\nThis kind of innovation, which takes into consideration the child's worries and fears, is much more likely to take place when the technicians themselves are disabled.\n2 of 3\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 33)\nGo back to the CONTENTS\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nby David Werner\nPublished by\nHealthWrights\nWorkgroup for People's Health and Rights\nPost Office Box 1344\nPalo Alto, CA 94302, USA\nCopyright 1998 by David Werner\n3 of 3\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 34)\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nPART FOUR\nWHEELS TO FREEDOM\nCHAPTER 34\nA Front-Wheel-Drive Wheelchair for Aide:\nLessons Learned from an Experiment that Failed\nAIDE is a 14 year old girl who is multiply disabled as a result of brain damage at birth. Her mind works at about the level of a 6- or 8-month-old child. She cannot speak, but she does\ncommunicate, in a limited way, through grunts and facial expressions. Physically, she has good head and trunk control. But she has a lot of spasticity, especially in the lower part of\nher body. On her first visit to PROJIMO, she was unable to move herself about or feed herself. She had little sense of the potential usefulness of her hands. But she would occasionally\ntake hold of different objects and hold them for a moment, then drop them.\nAide's family is very poor. Her parents put most of their energy into obtaining food and other resources to meet the family's basic needs. They did not know what to do with Aide. As a\nresult, they did little more than feed, bathe and clothe her.\nUnmet Potential. Even at PROJIMO, no one expects that Aide will ever be able to do much for herself. She responded little to early stimulation\nactivities or play-things that were tried with her.\nThe team thought that if Aide could begin to move herself about a bit in a wheelchair, this self-created movement might increase her awareness of\nher body's position and the usefulness of her arms and hands. They provided a wheelchair. Inez held her hands on the hand-rims and rolled the chair\nback and forth, hoping she would begin to make the connection between the movement of her hands and that of the chair.\nA New Wheelchair Design. Aide tried PROJIMO's wheelchair for a little while, and soon gave up. One difficulty was that,\nwith her spastic arms and shoulders, she had trouble reaching the wheel rims. PROJIMO-made wheelchairs, like most\ncommercial chairs, have the large wheels at the back and the small caster wheels up front. A visiting therapist, Ann Hallum,\npointed out that many persons with spasticity or limited range of motion find it hard to reach back far enough to effectively\npush the rear wheels. So PROJIMO's wheelchair makers, Armando and Jaime, decided to design a wheelchair with the large wheels in the front and the small\ncasters at the back.\nAnother reason why persons like Aide have trouble moving their wheelchairs is that the hand-rims, which are mounted on the outside of the\nlarge wheels, are so widely separated. So, Armando decided to try mounting the hand-rims on the inner side of the wheels. Closer to the\nrider's body, they would hopefully be easier for her to reach and to push.\nA possible advantage of the inward position of the hand-rims is that the wheels are further apart. This wide wheel-base should provide\nstability and less likelihood of tipping over. The chair could be safer for persons with strong uncontrolled movements.\nAlso, for a person with limited control, hand-rims on the inner side of the wheels protect the knuckles from banging into doorways and other objects.\n1 of 7\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 34)\nThe newly designed chair, with front-wheel-drive and internal hand-rims, was built in 4 days. It was tested, not only by Aide, but also by Tere, Lupita, and Carlos, all of whom\nhave spasticity that makes it hard for them to push rear-wheel-drive wheelchairs.\nAlthough the new chair did help to resolve some of the difficulties that some users had, none were happy with it.\nInez worked a lot with Aide in her new chair. He found it easier to position her spastic hands on the wheels, now that they were\nmounted further forward. She seemed more comfortable that way and, in time, began to close her hands on the wheels.\nInez would hold her wrists and push them forward, helping Aide to move the chair.\nHowever, Aide was unable to grip the hand-rims, that were mounted to the inside of the wheels. Her spastic fingers would\nbump into the wheels.\nSHORTCOMINGS OF THE NEW DESIGN\nIt is still too early to know if the new wheelchair will benefit Aide. So far, she still has not made much effort to push it by herself.\nHowever, she has begun to occasionally take hold of the large front wheels. This she had not done when the wheels were mounted further\nback.\nInez continues to work with Aide daily. He hopes that, at some point, she will discover the joy of moving herself by pushing on the\n2 of 7\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 34)\nwheels.\nTere, Lupita, and Carlos also tried the front-wheel-drive wheelchair. Both Tere and Lupita could reach the front-mounted wheels\nmore easily. But, when they tried to grip the inward-mounted hand-rims, like Aide, they had trouble fitting their spastic fingers between\nthe rims and wheels. So Armando widened the space between wheels and the rims.\nBut still the girls had trouble. The team decided that putting the hand rims on the inner side of\nthe wheels was simply not practical. Neither girl found the new design acceptable.\nCarlos, on the other hand, did not care where the hand-rims were. He always grips the tire, not the rim. However, the chair's unusually wide\nwheel-base gave the blind boy more stability when he tilted off a curb with one wheel, and in other spots where he might have tipped over in a\nnarrow chair. For Carlos, the wider wheel-base was helpful. (To avoid accidents, Carlos also learned to \"see\" with his foot. See next page.)\nPoor traction was the biggest problem with the front-mounted large wheels. On a smooth, level cement\nsurface, Carlos, Lupita, and Tere could move the chair about fairly easily. But, on an upward slope, or on\nsandy or uneven ground, the front wheels slipped. This happens because the rider's weight is mostly over the\nsmall, back caster-wheels, which dig into sand and stop short on a pitted surface. There is simply not enough\nweight over the large front wheels for them to firmly grip the ground.\nWith the front-wheel-drive chair, the only way to get good traction on a sloping or irregular surface is for the rider to lean far forward, shifting her\nweight over the front wheels. This, of course, can be difficult, especially for persons with spasticity. The team concluded that front-wheel-drive\nwheelchairs are of limited usefulness, particularly in rough, sandy, or uneven terrain.\nLearning from our mistakes. Not all innovations are successful. But we can learn a lot, even from efforts that fail. One lesson is extremely\nimportant:\nAdequate trials of new designs are essential, and must include the\nintended users, within the local environment where they live.\nCarlos and his \"Seeing-Eye Foot\"\nBecause Carlos is almost completely blind, he sometimes has a hard time finding his way in his wheelchair. However, he has figured out\ndifferent ways to stay on paths and to avoid bumping into things.\nIn Chapter 32 we saw how Carlos recruited a \"seeing-eye person\" to guide him while he pushes her wheelchair.\nSince Carlos needs both his hands to drive his wheelchair, he cannot use a cane to feel his way, as many blind persons do. Instead of a cane, he\nhas learned to use his right foot. He takes his foot off the foot-rest and puts it lightly on the ground in front of him. As he rolls forward, with\nhis foot he can feel when he begins to go off a pathway or curb.\nThat way, he can often correct his direction before he has a mishap.\nAlthough Carlos' seeing-eye foot serves him well, sometimes he forgets to use it. Or, at times, he tries\nto maneuver his wheelchair over curbs or rough terrain, and the chair tips over. He has had a few nasty\nfalls.\n3 of 7\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 34)\nFor this reason, the front-wheel-drive wheelchair, with its widely separated front wheels, is safer for Carlos than is a narrow chair. The\nwide chair tips over sideways less easily. Having the large wheels in front also appears to give more stability.\nNevertheless, on loose or sandy soil, the front-wheel-drive chair has poor traction. Often, Carlos found himself trapped in pockets of loose soil\nwhere the front wheels would slip, and where he could not wheel himself out without help. As a result, Carlos prefers his narrower,\nrear-wheel-drive wheelchair - even though he tips over more often.\nWARNING:\nDon't Assume That All the Designs You See in Pamphlets or Books on \"Appropriate Technology\" Are Appropriate.\nMany booklets on \"appropriate technology\" for disabled people show designs of wheelchairs and hand-powered tricycles with front-wheel-drive. Such chairs are often given to disabled\npersons, especially in Asia and Africa. They may work fairly well in exhibition halls, and on level hard-surfaced roads. But on rough terrain they are likely to further handicap the\nuser. The rider may need an assistant to push her in circumstances where a better designed wheelchair or tricycle could provide more independent mobility.\nCAUTION:\nThe various designs of front-wheel-drive wheelchairs and tricycles shown here are taken from manuals and instruction sheets on equipment for\ndisabled people.\nBut in some circumstances, instead of increasing the rider's freedom through mobility, these models may cause greater dependence, need\nfor assistance, or inability to venture forth.\nHowever ...\nfor certain children, a front wheel drive wheelchair may be the best choice (see below).\n4 of 7\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 34)\nSOME CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY FIND BIG FRONT WHEELS EASIER TO REACH AND PUSH\nAs with most rules, there are exceptions. Front-wheel-drive chairs are often inappropriate. But some children with spasticity, like Aide, may find large front\nwheels easier to handle. Trollies and wheeled cots (see page 235) often work better with the big wheels up front.\nA scooter board for certain children with cerebral palsy has been designed with the large wheels positioned right under the child, and with small wheels\nboth at the back and front. For travel on rough ground, the child can learn to balance on the center wheels and barely touch the ground with the others.\nThis scooter slopes forward, so that a child with hips that thrust him backward, or that do not bend to 90 degrees, can sit up straight. (See positive seating,\nChapter 4.)\nREMEMBER: Some of the best design improvements come from the ideas and suggestions of the persons who try them out and will use them. This is true even for children.\nThe child may not always be right. But doctors, therapists, and technicians are not always right either, especially if they do not live in the same situation and experience the same\n5 of 7\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 34)\nbarriers and desires. By respecting each other's special knowledge and looking for solutions together, we can more nearly meet the disabled person's needs.\nNote: The above front-wheel-drive chair not only risks tipping backward, it will lose traction going uphill, The front wheels do not support enough of the child's weight to grip well, so\nthey will slip.\nMounting the rear caster wheel farther back will help prevent the chair from tipping over backwards on an uphill slope. It will also shift more\nweight over the front wheels and give them better traction. For these reasons, this modified design is included in the book, Disabled Village\nChildren. But even when the rear caster is farther back, traction is not good.\nAnother problem with front-wheel-drive wheelchairs is that the rider can not do \"wheelies.\"\nPOPPING A WHEELIE TO MOVE OVER ROUGH TERRAIN\n6 of 7\n2/17/2007 9:31 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 34)\nA rule to consider:\nNever follow instructions blindly.

I (the author) am an advisor\nto PROJIMO in the village of Ajoya, Mexico, and live on the second floor of a small, two-story cement-block building there. My friends at PROJIMO rightly criticized me for living in\ninaccessible quarters.\nBut how could the upper-level of my home be made more accessible to wheelchair riders? The entry is via a steep wooden stairway: little more than a solid step-ladder that leans\nagainst a rectangular opening in the upstairs floor. A ramp would be out of the question in the small room with so many steep stairs. The only possibility would be some sort of\nelevator. But a commercial motorized elevator, or lift - even a small one, designed to glide up a stairway - would be far too expensive. Besides, the supply of electricity to the village is\ntoo unreliable. What to do?\nA Simple, Home-Made Elevator\nTo make the upstairs accessible to wheelchair riders, a visiting inventor from Holland, Reinder van Tijen, together with two disabled craftspersons at PROJIMO, Martin Perez and\nMarcelo Acevedo, helped to design and build a simple elevator lifted by gravity. The elevator consists of a plywood platform mounted on a frame of steel tubing. Welded to the frame\nare sets of ball bearings that roll along a diagonal pipe attached to the stairway.\n1 of 6\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 35)\nThe platform is lifted by a cable that passes through a hole in the cement block wall at the top of the stairs.\nThe cable rolls through pulleys, which are made from the front wheels of old wheelchairs, mounted on steel plates and bolted through the wall.\nThe cable is attached to a counter-balance that rolls up and down the outer wall.\nThe counter-balance is weighted with cement blocks, the number of which can be varied so as to match the weight of the particular wheelchair rider. When properly counter-balanced,\nthe elevator glides effortlessly up and down the stairwell.\nDetails of the elevator\nA short diagonal pipe welded to the metal frame of the elevator is equipped at either end with 4 sets of ball\nbearings. These bearings fit snugly around the diagonal pipe next to the stairs.\nAnother set of ball bearings, attached to the other side of the elevator frame, rolls up and down the edge of\nthe wood plank on the right side of the stairs.\n2 of 6\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 35)\nSafety problems that needed solving\nThe simple elevator worked well. It has now been used by wheelchair-riding visitors for more than 4 years. Since the time it was built,\nhowever, visiting engineers warned that the elevator was unsafe. The biggest risk factor, they insisted, was the lack of an automatic\nlocking mechanism to safely hold the platform in place when it reached ground level.\nAs designed, the platform had to be locked by the rider on reaching ground level. A bolt was slipped through two holes: one in the\nelevator frame, and one in the diagonal pipe on which the elevator rolled. As long as this bolt was in place before the rider rolled off\nthe platform, there was no problem. But, if he forgot and rolled off without inserting the bolt, the elevator would rocket skyward. This\nhappened once, when a small boy was standing on the edge of the elevator. The platform took off like a rocket. The surprised boy shot\nupward and fell off into a water tank below. Fortunately, he was unhurt. But if anyone had been on the stairs when the elevator\nrocketed upward, heaven help them.\nAn automatic parking brake for the gravity-run elevator.\nAlthough visiting engineers insisted that the elevator needed an automatic locking mechanism, none offered a\ndesign. Finally, it was Marcelo, the disabled PROJIMO craftsperson, who designed and built a fail-safe automatic\nlocking mechanism for the elevator. He made it out of scraps of iron bar, a spring, and a few bolts.\nMarcelo modified the design of a latch he built for PROJIMO's main gate, which locks automatically when it\nswings closed. (He made it after the gate was left open at night and cows ate the banana plants.)\n3 of 6\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 35)\nThe device is simple. A U-shaped iron bracket is bolted to the side beam\nof the stairs. To this is attached a V-shaped latch, made by welding flat\niron bars. The latch, which pivots on a bolt, is pulled forward by a spring. This latch hooks onto an upright post, welded to the platform frame\n(the post to which the elevator lift-cable is attached). When the elevator comes down, the post pushes the latch out of the way. Having passed,\nthe latch springs back, hooking onto the post and locking the platform at ground level.\nThe device was tested 100 times and appears fool-proof. The only way to unlock the latch is to put enough weight on the platform so that it lowers a bit more, then push the latch out of\nthe way. As an added safety mechanism, the original bolt-lock can still be used when the elevator is not in use - giving double protection.\nIn conclusion: Thanks to the warnings of visiting engineers, plus the creative design and building skill of Marcelo, the gravity-run elevator is now much safer.\nStairs Need Not Be So Big an Obstacle When There are Willing Friends\n4 of 6\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 35)\nSometimes a barrier can become a chance for camaraderie.

See the\nstory by Mike Miles on page 172.)\nRamps\nIn many circumstances, ramps are far cheaper and more practical than elevators.\nThe recommended grade (steepness) of a ramp depends on the strength of its users, and whether they have, or need, assistance. Ramps for\npublic use should have a very gentle slope, so that persons with weak arms can go up them without assistance. But in limited space, a steep\nramp may be better than none.\n5 of 6\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 35)\nGo back to the CONTENTS\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nby David Werner\nPublished by\nHealthWrights\nWorkgroup for People's Health and Rights\nPost Office Box 1344\nPalo Alto, CA 94302, USA\nCopyright 1998 by David Werner\n6 of 6\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 36)\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nPART FOUR\nWHEELS TO FREEDOM\nCHAPTER 36\nParaplegics Who Walk Where\nWheelchairs Won't Enter (India)\nInnovations For, By and With Spinal-Cord Injured Persons in India\nCenters for rehabilitation in the United States and many other countries encourage most spinal-cord injured persons to use wheelchairs as their primary way of moving about. Except for\na few persons with low-level or incomplete injuries, walking is considered too difficult.\nThis emphasis on wheelchair riding with ease rather than walking with difficulty reflects the current trend in rehabilitation. The goal of maximum function is placed before\nnormalization - even if this means doing some things \"abnormally\" (differently from how most people do them). Today, many spinal-cord injury self-help groups strongly encourage\nmembers to \"Accept yourself as a wheelchair rider and get on with your life.\" Individuals are gently discouraged from putting a lot of hope or energy into \"learning to walk again.\"\nInstead, they are urged to \"join in the fight for accessibility and social acceptance of wheelchair riders.\"\nI was, therefore, surprised by the approach of the rehabilitation center linked with the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, which I visited in 1995 during a UN workshop on\n\"Indigenous Assistive Devices for Disabled Persons.\" At the center, many paraplegic persons were being vigorously trained to walk with leg braces and elbow crutches.\nStarted in 1934 by a visionary woman doctor who was paralyzed in a car accident, the Vellore Center is recognized as the country's best, most comprehensive spinal-cord injury\nprogram. I was impressed, not only by the quality of services and innovativeness of activities, but by its human warmth and convivial spirit. The center's outstanding staff made a point\nof including disabled persons in the problem-solving process: as friends, co-workers, and equals.\nInnovations at the center included a traditional village, complete with thatched huts and vegetable gardens. Here, disabled villagers\nlived and relearned the skills and the activities of daily living in a typical rural environment. We saw persons working and moving\nabout there on crutches, or sometimes, crawling with knee-pads - but few used wheelchairs.\nAt first, I was concerned by the emphasis on walking rather than on wheelchair use. In recent years, India's government has launched a\nmajor program of wheelchair production. In cities, at least, increased attention is placed on wheelchair access (though there continues to\nbe a huge unmet need).\nI asked the Director: \"Why such a strong emphasis on walking? Wouldn't it be more realistic to teach most paraplegic persons to use\nprimarily wheelchairs?\"\n\"Not at all!\" he said. \"Most spinal-cord injured persons who pass through our center come from remote villages, where wheelchair use is\n1 of 4\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 36)\nalmost impossible.\n\"You will see for yourselves when we go to a village this afternoon.\"\nHe was so right!\nVisit to an Independent Sugar-Cane Farmer Who is Paraplegic\nWe visited a paraplegic man on the outskirts of a small village. To reach his homestead, we drove the last 2 or 3 miles over a narrow, muddy, rutted\ncountry road, difficult to travel even in a Jeep. For the last 200 yards, we had to travel by foot. We quickly realized the limitations of a wheelchair\nin such places.\nOn arrival, we made our way through a muddy field behind a large mud house. There we saw a man standing next to a\nsmall, rustic gasoline-motor-run sugar-cane mill. He was skillfully pushing armfuls of green cane into the rolling jaws of\nthe machine. Helping him was a boy who, we learned, was his son. We had to look twice to realize that the man was\ndisabled. He wore full-leg braces and arched his body backwards to stand and work with both hands, without having to\nsupport himself with his crutches.\nRAM, the man at the mill, saw us approaching. He bounded over a pile of milled cane and\ngreeted us warmly. He was dark, muscular, and had a look of uncrushable self-assurance. He\nappeared to be in excellent health (better than many people in India's hunger-ridden rural\nareas).\nWe observed Ram doing a variety of daily chores, ranging from clearing pathways to leading\nhis cow to pasture across the narrow dikes of a rice field. Totally self-sufficient, he provided\nfor his wife and children through his own hard physical labor. He had the innovativeness of\none who, since childhood, has lived in a difficult environment where dexterity and creative ingenuity are essential skills\nfor staving off hunger and for survival.\nA pit latrine. Ram's innovations included a pit latrine with a wooden toilet seat (unusual for rural India, where the custom is simply to squat). He had built it\nnext to a cement-covered mud-brick water trough. (The pit was over 2 meters deep, in order to avoid contamination of the surface water that fed the trough,\nwhich ran through a shallow ditch from a spring, 200 yards away.)\nHome-grown castor-oil catheter lubricant. Ram had also found a way to catheterize himself at low cost. Like most spinal-cord injured persons who lack\nnormal bladder control, to drain out urine he needed to pass a catheter (clean rubber tube) through his penis into his bladder every few hours.\nRubber catheters can be cleaned and reused hundreds of times (see Chapter 25, on catheterization). But for each use, they need to be lubricated (oiled). And\ncommercial medical lubricants - such as KY Jelly - are expensive.\nTo save money, Ram had stopped using costly medical lubricants and had begun to use castor oil. But he soon\n2 of 4\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 36)\nlearned that commercial castor oil was contaminated, causing repeated urinary infections. So he planted his own\ncastor trees, harvested the beans, and pressed them carefully under clean conditions to extract the oil. With this\nclean home-made oil, he explained, he now had almost no problems with urinary infections.\nA two-rear-wheel-drive tricycle. For most of his farm work, Ram moved about with full-leg orthopedic braces and crutches made at the\nrehab center in Vellore. But for travel into town, he used an \"all terrain tricycle\" that he had designed and built with help from a local\nwelder.\nMost hand-powered tricycles made in India have front-wheel-drive, and they are therefore useless in mud and sand. The front wheel has\nlittle traction and tends to slip because the person's weight is mostly over the back wheels.\nBut Ram's tricycle was different.\nRam's tricycle has 2 hand cranks (adapted bicycle pedals), one on either side. With bicycle chains and sprockets, they power both back wheels.\nThe steering mechanism consists of a bar extending back from a bicycle fork that holds the single front wheel. When traveling on a fairly hard, flat\nroadway, Ram can steer with one hand and pedal the chair with the other (one wheel drive). For two-wheel-traction in mud or sand, he can pedal\nwith both hands. But that means he must let go of the steering rod.\nIn order to keep the chair moving ahead in a straight line when he is not holding the steering rod, Ram improvised a\nspring device on the steering shaft of the front wheel fork. (See photo on left.)\nThe 2 springs persistently push the front wheel into a straight position. When Ram comes to a curve in the path, he lets\ngo of one pedal just long enough to get around the curve. When he lets go of the steering rod, the front wheel automatically straightens.\nAnother advantage of this two-hand rear-wheel-drive tricycle (compared to one-hand-drive ones) is that for long distances it is less tiring to use. The rider can\nprovide power with both arms at once, or use only one arm while resting the other.\n(For more ideas on hand-powered tricycles, see Chapter 31. For a \"4-wheel drive\" all-terrain tricycle, see the drawing at the bottom of page 343.)\nObserving the innovative problem-solving skills of rural disabled persons like Ram made a deep impression on the visiting rehabilitation specialists and\ntechnicians. By the end of the 10 day workshop, many declared they would work more as \"partners in problem solving\" with disabled clients, and encourage\nthem to design or improve upon their own devices and solutions.\nThe visiting professionals gained greater respect for the creativity and abilities, not only of disabled people, but of poor, unschooled, disabled people. And that was a big step\nforward.\n3 of 4\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 36)\nGo back to the CONTENTS\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nby David Werner\nPublished by\nHealthWrights\nWorkgroup for People's Health and Rights\nPost Office Box 1344\nPalo Alto, CA 94302, USA\nCopyright 1998 by David Werner\n4 of 4\n2/17/2007 9:32 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 37)\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nPART FOUR\nWHEELS TO FREEDOM\nCHAPTER 37\nMartin Builds a Jointed Gurney\nto Keep His Hips from Stiffening\nMARTIN Perez, since he was 10 years old, lived on the streets in Culiacan, the capital city of the state of Sinaloa, Mexico. He survived by stealing, doing odd\njobs, and trafficking drugs. At age 15, as a result of a gang dispute, he was shot through the spine and became paraplegic (paralyzed from the middle of the\nback down). Upon his release from the hospital, he was sent to PROJIMO.\nOn his arrival, Martin was near death from a urinary infection and pressure sores that had developed in the hospital. He was angry and depressed, but had the\nwill and spirit of a survivor.\nAs is usual in PROJIMO, other spinal-cord injured persons took over the management of Martin's urinary problem and\npressure sores. In the wheelchair shop, they built a wheeled cot, or gurney, so that he could be active while lying on his\nstomach, and so his sores (on his backside) would heal.\nFrozen hips. Martin recovered his health, and his sores healed in record time. But a new problem was\ndeveloping. His hip joints were beginning to ossify - in other words, the flesh around the hip joints was\nbeginning to turn into bone.\nThis problem, called myositis ossificans, occurs occasionally in spinal-cord injured persons. It happened\nto Jaime, a worker in PROJIMO's wheelchair shop. Because his hips are solidly fused into a straight\nposition, Jaime works while lying on a gurney (see photos on pages 195, 200 and 247).\nThere is a debate among specialists as to what to do when myositis ossificans starts to develop. Some recommend very limited motion of the\nhips, in the belief that movement causes irritation and speeds the deposit of bone. Others argue in favor of aggressive range-of-motion\nexercises, to try to stop the joints from freezing up. Martin learned that Jaime had not exercised during the time when his hips became\nossified. Therefore - at a stage when Martin's hips had almost no movement left - he set about exercising to bring back flexibility. Every\nmorning his hips were so stiff he could barely move them. But he would diligently exercise for an hour or more to recover lost range of motion.\n1 of 4\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 37)\nWith his persistent exercise program, Martin managed, in time, to regain complete range of motion of his hips. Nevertheless, every morning his hips would partially \"freeze up.\" For\nyears, he had to keep up his morning exercise routine to maintain flexibility.\nMartin's great strengths and weaknesses. In PROJIMO, Martin's presence was a mixed blessing. On the negative side, he had a violent temper which sometimes led to acts of\nphysical violence. He also used drugs (mainly marijuana) on the PROJIMO grounds, even though drug use was prohibited by group decision. He was also openly critical of weaknesses\nin the organization and its leadership, which caused his own errors to be less tolerated. (Eventually he was expelled.)\nOn the positive side, Martin developed into an extremely innovative and creative wheelchair builder. He solved design problems in the Whirlwind\nwheelchair that disability engineer Ralf Hotchkiss had struggled with for years (such as a very simple mechanism to adjust the angle of the footrests).\nRalf was so impressed with Martin's abilities that he invited him to live in his home and to work in his shop for a number of months. Martin even\nbecame a teaching assistant in Ralf's course in rehabilitation design and engineering at San Francisco State University, in California.\nAlso on the positive side, Martin was very friendly and helpful to some of the neediest disabled children at PROJIMO. Whenever they needed help with\ntheir aids or equipment, they went to Martin, who would always help them in a warm, personal, and effective way.\nA Jointed Gurney for Post-Surgery Recovery\nMartin was sometimes too active and hard working for his own good. He had begun to use a wheelchair before the last pressure sore on his backside had healed. As a result, the sore\nalthough it had healed except for a small opening on the surface - had formed a large and stubborn cavity underneath. Periodically this cavity became infected. Surgeons from Interplast\n(International Plastic Surgery) who examined Martin decided he needed surgery to repair the deep sore. They offered to do the operation free of charge, in Stanford, California.\nMartin's biggest worry was the post-operative period. The surgeons told him he would need to lie on a special \"air bed\" for 6 weeks, to allow healing. But Martin - who knows his own\nbody well - feared his hips would freeze up forever if he lay flat for so long and could not do his daily bending exercises. In order to maintain flexibility, he felt that during the\npost-surgery period he needed to be positioned at different and changing hip angles. He told the surgeons he could make a jointed gurney with adjustable hip and knee angles to\nuse post-operatively. But the surgeons were skeptical.\nThe surgeons doubted that Martin could make a satisfactory gurney. And if he did, they doubted that he would be able to lie on it face down all day long.\nBut Martin was persistent. The doctors decided to test him. They insisted that he spend three days and nights continuously on the gurney, to prove that he could do it without\ncomplications. Martin did this successfully, and the doctors at last agreed to let him use the gurney following surgery, instead of being on the special hospital bed.\n2 of 4\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 37)\nExcellent results. To the doctors' amazement, on his jointed gurney Martin's post-operative recovery went remarkably quickly and well. They observed that Martin was very active on\nthe gurney. They agreed that such activity increased blood circulation, which probably speeded surgical healing. (This finding is consistent with other observations by the PROJIMO\nteam on the healing of pressure sores, after surgery and otherwise. See \"Medical Treatment of Osvaldo's Pressure Sores,\" page 252.)\nTHE GURNEY\nThe flexible gurney that Martin made for his post-surgical recovery period was built on top of a standard donated wheelchair. The hip and knee angles\ncould be easily adjusted by hand. He upholstered each section of the gurney with water-resistant vinyl (plastic cloth).\nThe above photos show Martin trying out his new gurney, and the gurney alone in 3 of the many different positions to which it can be adjusted.\nDifferent Kinds of Jointed Gurneys\nOther jointed gurneys have been custom-built at PROJIMO and used by persons with a variety of needs. Here is a gurney for a boy, DANIEL, who is paraplegic due to tuberculosis of\nhis spine. When Daniel came to PROJIMO, his body, hips and knees were contracted in a sitting position, and he had severe pressure sores. Therefore, the team built for him an\nadjustable, jointed gurney that could gradually straighten him out.\n3 of 4\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 37)\nThe gurney has a hole in it through which the boy can pass urine - with or without a catheter - into a bag or bottle. (Spinal-cord injured persons usually lack urine control. See page 147.)\nIn contrast, the next chapter describes a jointed gurney that was built for a boy (Osvaldo) to gradually bend his hips and knees, which had stiffened in an extended (straight) position.\nAdditional information on designs for wheeled cots or gurneys can be found in the book, Disabled Village Children.

He lived with his ailing mother on a hill on the outskirts of Culiacan, the\nstate capital of Sinaloa, Mexico. His father had abandoned the family years before. His mother worked in a factory, for wages so low that sometimes\nthere was little to eat. Osvaldo went to school, but he often skipped classes to do odd jobs or to play.\nWhen he was 13 years old, an event happened that drastically changed Osvaldo's life. He was playing with friends on the roadside outside the\nfamily hut, when a truck parked at the top of the hill, and the driver got out. Then the hand-brake failed, and the truck rolled down the steep dirt road\ntoward the children at play. It suddenly pitched off the narrow road, straight into the children. One child was killed, four were injured. Because the driver\nhad not been in the truck (and had slipped the police a bribe) he was not held responsible.\nAfter he was hit, Osvaldo - dazed and bleeding - tried to stand up. But he could not move his legs or his right arm. Neighbors took\nhim to the hospital. The doctors found his spinal cord was crushed at mid-back level (T6). He had a double fracture of his right\nleg, above and below the knee. His right shoulder was broken and dislocated, with nerve damage that left his right hand and arm\nparalyzed.\nSo it was that, at age 13, Osvaldo became triplegic (paralyzed in 3 of 4 limbs). He had lost all movement and feeling in his lower\nbody and had no urine or bowel control. In the hospital his broken spine was stabilized surgically with metal rods. (Fortunately,\nOsvaldo's mother had social security insurance which covered most of the medical expenses.)\nOn his release from the hospital, Osvaldo was taken by ambulance to his home. Unfortunately, neither he nor his mother had been\ngiven instructions about prevention of pressure sores and urinary infections. So, day after day, Osvaldo lay on his back on a burlap\ncot without moving. A month later, when a nurse made a home visit, she found that his back, buttocks, and heels were covered with\npressure sores. The hospital then provided an \"egg crate\" foam mattress, and a nurse instructed the boy's mother to \"Turn him\nfrequently from side to side.\"\nBut this was easier said than done, as his mother soon discovered. Osvaldo had sunk into severe depression which expressed itself as anger, directed mostly at his mother. His\nparalyzed right hand was extremely sensitive: it gave him unbearable, burning pain, especially when it was moved. He rested it over his chest without moving it for weeks and months.\nIn time, his right arm became stiffly fixed in front of him. He was so afraid of having his painful hand touched or moved that he refused to let his mother get near it. Whenever\nshe tried to move him he would weep and protest. Using his good left arm, he fiercely fought off her attempts to turn him on his side. Because of his lack of urine and bowel control, she\nhad a hard time keeping him clean.\n1 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nPROJIMO TO THE RESCUE\nIn November, 1991, on a visit to the capital city, two disabled workers from PROJIMO learned about Osvaldo and visited his home. Five months after his accident, the boy was near\ndeath. Emaciated, anemic, and very depressed, he had deep pressure sores, a urinary infection and chronic fever. His doctors had not stressed the importance of drinking lots of water to\nreduce the risk of urinary infection. Adding to the danger, they had not changed him from a permanent catheter (urine-draining tube) to intermittent catheterization (see page 147). His\ndark urine had so much crud in it that the catheter often clogged. His pressure sores, which his mother did her best to clean and bandage, were infected and had black necrotic (dead)\nareas.\nThe worst sores were on the back of his ankles. They formed after the visiting nurse - worried about the sores on his heels - told his\nmother, \"Keep a rolled-up towel under his ankles.\" His mother had carefully followed the nurse's orders. Four months later (when the\nPROJIMO workers visited the home) deep sores had formed where the towel was still obediently positioned. The sore under the left\nankle was so deep that it bared the Achilles tendon.\nThis was a powerful lesson for the PROJIMO workers. They saw the danger of simply giving cookbook-like instructions without\nexplanations. On the contrary, it is important to:\nHelp people to fully understand the reasons for doing things, so that they are able to\nmake well-informed decisions, based on their own observations and changing needs.\nFurther complicating Osvaldo's condition was his delicate, often angry mood, his fear of pain or injury, and the excruciating sensitivity of his paralyzed right hand. Yielding to his\ntearful protests, his mother had given up attempting to turn him onto his side or belly. So, for five months he had lain on his back, his pressure sores getting larger and deeper, and his\nbody growing as stiff as a board.\nOn seeing Osvaldo, the PROJIMO workers felt that - due to the difficult combination of physical and emotional needs - more might be accomplished in their small community\nrehabilitation center than in the home. They invited him and his mother to spend a while at PROJIMO. At first, Osvaldo was afraid to leave home ... or even to be moved from his cot.\nBut the warmth and concern of the PROJIMO workers gave him a new sense of hope. Gathering courage, he accepted their offer. The next morning, with Osvaldo lying on a foam\nmattress in the back of a station wagon, the group made the 4-hour trip to PROJIMO.\nThe Need for a Creative and Loving Approach\nThe complexity of Osvaldo's needs called for very caring rehabilitation and innovative assistive equipment. His urinary infection and sores\nrequired urgent attention. For the former, the team gave him antibiotics and encouraged him to drink lots of fluids. However, he often\nrefused to drink, even when we explained its importance. Since Osvaldo's favorite drinks were orange juice and hot chocolate, we pampered\nhim with all of these he could drink. As his urinary infection got better, so did his mood and appetite.\nThe team put Osvaldo on a high calorie, high protein, high iron diet. Improving his nutritional status and blood level would help to heal his\npressure sores, and fight off the urinary infection.\n2 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nManaging Osvaldo's Pressure Sores - and Lifting His Spirits\nThe next job was to find a way of taking the pressure off of Osvaldo's pressure sores. To manage the sores on the back and buttocks, PROJIMO usually builds a gurney, or trolley\n(narrow wheeled bed), on which the person can lie face down. That way he can wheel himself around, and energetically work and play. Keeping active not only makes lying face down\nfor long periods more tolerable, but it also stimulates circulation, which speeds healing.\nWith Osvaldo, however, lying face down was not an easy matter. From having lain flat on his back for months, his entire body had become as stiff as a board. Also, his paralyzed right\narm was almost \"frozen,\" with his forearm over his chest. Both the shoulder and hand were so super-sensitive that he would howl even before someone touched them.\nThe first job was to win Osvaldo's trust and to involve him in the problem-solving process. The team tried to give him a sense of control that would help him overcome his fear. Often, it\nseemed that his fear of the pain was worse than the pain itself. Certainly it made the pain worse.\nOn discussing Osvaldo's wishes and needs with him and his mother, it became clear that the management of his sores needed an integrated plan to lift both his body and his spirit.\nHis various physical and emotional needs needed to be answered in a \"whole-person,\" or holistic, way. The group agreed that the major short-term objectives with Osvaldo were:\nto figure out ways to get the pressure off Osvaldo's sores for prolonged periods and, as soon as possible, to find a way for him to lie face down without lying on top of his stiff,\nhypersensitive right arm and hand;\nto help him regain flexibility of his hips and knees, so that he could begin to sit: first in bed, and later (after his pressure sores healed) in a wheelchair;\nto correct the foot-drop (contracture of the heel cords) that had begun to form;\nto help him increase the strength and ability of his useful (left) arm - a greater challenge because he had been right-handed;\nto design mobility aids that Osvaldo could move and steer with only one arm;\nto provide a range of enjoyable and useful activities so as to encourage self-care, self confidence, and more independence;\nwhile doing all of the above, to provide a friendly, understanding, stimulating, entertaining, and adventurous environment - to help Osvaldo pull out of his depression and\nrediscover joy in life, the will to live, and ability to love.\nTalking with Osvaldo was not easy. It took time for him to gain enough confidence in himself and in others to speak seriously. What\nseemed to distress him most was his sense of powerlessness and total immobility. He feared remaining dependent, not being able to do\nanything for himself, to move, or to go anywhere without help.\nTherefore, helping Osvaldo learn to do more for himself, manage his personal body functions, and move under his own power\nwere seen as urgent goals which could contribute to his healing in many ways.\nIn these pages, we will not describe all the aspects of Osvaldo's rehabilitation - rather we will focus on several of the most innovative\naids and activities.\nInnovations For and With Osvaldo\nTo help meet the various objectives of Osvaldo's rehabilitation - or revitalization - the PROJIMO team designed a number of innovative devices. They will be described here in the order\nin which they were created and used.\nIt is important to note that most of these innovations were developed with the active participation of Osvaldo himself. In the process, this 13-year-old boy acquired a much clearer\n3 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nunderstanding of his body, its unusual needs, and how to meet them. He began to rediscover and become friendly with his own mysterious body, and to increasingly take charge of his\nown rehabilitation and care. Soon he was reminding and guiding his attendants (especially his mother) about how to position him and where to place padding to prevent pressure sores.\nHis testing, criticism, and suggestions for improvements of devices became a valuable part of the innovative process. As he became an active participant in the design of his own\nequipment, he gained new confidence, lost much of his fear of trying new things, was less fretful, and gradually became again a friendly, playful boy - although strangely perceptive and\nwise for his age. (He avidly read Disabled Village Children and gave suggestions for the rehabilitation of other children.)\nAN ADJUSTABLE BED\n- To help reduce pressure over sores, bend his stiff body, and prepare him for sitting\nComplexity of the problem: Clearly, for rapid healing of his pressure sores, Osvaldo needed to stop lying on his back and start lying on his belly or side. However, the team realized the\nneed to move toward this slowly, at a pace the boy could tolerate and control. Osvaldo was terrified of being shifted to a new position that might trigger the pain in his hypersensitive\nshoulder and hand. It had taken his last bit of courage just to come to PROJIMO, and the team did not want to push him too hard or fast. In the first days, especially, it was essential that\nhis experience at PROJIMO be as reassuring and uplifting as possible. Therefore the team, together with Osvaldo and his mother, tried to think of ways to reduce the pressure on the\nsores on his back and buttocks - and to help him regain some flexibility in his hips and knees - while still lying face up.\nPartial solution: To reduce pressure over the bony areas with sores, Osvaldo was laid on a double foam mattress, the lower one thick and fairly firm, the upper one quite soft. To help\nspeed healing, the sores were packed daily with a paste made of bees' honey and sugar (see page 156).\nFrom lying flat on his back for so long, Osvaldo's hips and knees had grown so stiff (with extension contractures) that they almost would not bend at all. Bending exercises were\nintroduced. What was needed, however, was prolonged, very gentle stretching. It would have helped to have a hospital bed that could be gradually cranked up into a sitting position,\nslowly bending the hips and knees. But such a costly item was out of the question.\nPartial solution: an adjustable, hinged plywood bed board.\nMaterials: 1 sheet plywood; 2 strips old cloth (about 6 inches wide); white glue.\nConstruction: A piece of plywood the size of the cot was cut in three pieces based on Osvaldo's body measurements (A=feet to knees,\nB=knees to hips, C=hips to head). The plywood sections were then joined together with cloth hinges made with strips of old towel and\nwhite glue.\n4 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\n1. A metal triangle, hanging from a rope over Osvaldo's bed, allowed him to lift himself up periodically with his good\narm. This took pressure off his back, and also helped strengthen his arm.\n2. By putting padding under Osvaldo's knees, some of the weight could be taken off his backside.\n3. This padding reduced the pressure on his buttocks and lower back, where he had some of his worst sores.\n4. Padding was also placed under his lower legs, to take pressure off his heels and ankles.\n5. By putting boxes of different sizes under the bed-boards, the angle of his hips and knees could gradually be\nincreased.\nResults: Flexibility of Osvaldo's body returned surprisingly quickly. Within a few weeks, both his hips and knees flexed to\nalmost to 90 degrees. Also, being able to move into a partly sitting position allowed the boy to do more things more easily\n(eat, read, draw pictures, and take part in what was going on around him). His disposition improved accordingly. And his\npressure sores began to heal.\nTechnical problem: With repeated removal and replacement of the hinged plywood bed-board between the two foam mattresses, the\ncloth hinges began to tear loose.\nSolution: hinges made of thin cord. As an experimental alternative, hinges were made using cord (thick string). The cord passes through\nsmall holes in the edges of the plywood sections.\nResults of cord hinges: These hinges were as quick and easy to make as the cloth hinges, and they could be used at once (whereas several\nhours of drying time were needed before the cloth-and-glue hinges could be used). The cord hinges are stronger and hold up longer than\nthe cloth hinges (although this clearly depends on the relative strength of the cord, the cloth, and the glue).\nA SIMPLE AID FOR ACTIVE CORRECTION AND PREVENTION OF FOOT-DROP, IN BED\nThe problem: From lying in bed so long, Osvaldo had begun to develop contractures of his heel cords (Achilles tendons). This made it\ndifficult to bring his feet up to 90 degrees. He wanted to do this with the dream of someday standing or even walking - or at least so his feet\nwould be in a good position and he could wear shoes.\n5 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nOsvaldo wondered if there was some way he could do the exercises by himself to regain the flexibility of his ankles.\nThe solution: a flexible foot-board pulled by a rope.\nMaterials: a short piece of thin wood plank; 2 narrow boards about 2 cm. by 6 cm. by 60 cm. long; a piece of rope (about 1 meter); a piece of\ndense rubber foam (to cushion the feet).\nConstruction: Notch wood, drill hole, and assemble as shown.\nHow it works: The footboard is placed to keep the feet upright (as near to 90 degrees as possible). For his heel-cord stretching exercises, Osvaldo pulled the rope himself.\nAs Osvaldo pulls the rope, the front ends of the side boards sink into the foam mattress, angling the footboard forward and stretching the feet (and heel-cords).\nResults: The device worked fairly well. The hinge-like action, which allowed the foofboard to angle forward more when pulled, was unplanned and recognized only when tried. The\ndevice actively involved Osvaldo in exercises to correct and prevent further contractures of his ankles. Moreover, to do the exercises, he had to move his upper body and shoulders\nsomewhat, which he had resisted doing because of his hypersensitive right arm. So the foot exercises were also good therapy for his painful shoulder and arm.\nAN ADJUSTABLE BED TABLE\nThe problem: Osvaldo, who before his accident had been right-handed, needed to develop confidence and skill in using his left hand. He also\nneeded activities to keep him interested and busy during the long periods of lying in a flat or semi-sitting position. For this, he needed a table which\ncould easily be rolled over his bed, and which could adjust both in slant and in height. The group decided that a wooden design, which any village\ncarpenter could make, would be ideal.\nSolution: Two of the workers in the carpentry shop (Mario, who is paraplegic, and Rafa, who is quadriplegic) designed and built the wooden table\nshown below.\n6 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nSmall bolts with butterfly nuts for adjusting height.\nTable pivots on bolt passing through curved groove.\nButterfly nuts for adjusting angle.\nWooden wheels allow bed table to be easily rolled into place, yet provide enough friction for stability.\nWooden bar keeps objects from slipping when table is tilted. The bar is attached with wooden rods (dowels) and can be removed when table is flat - for eating, etc.\nResults: The table was handsome, strong, and it worked well. It was large and solid enough to double as a drafting table. It could also be used as a typing or work table by someone in a\nwheelchair. This model can be easily made or adapted by a local carpenter. Wooden wheels help keep the cost down. The only welding necessary was to fasten the \"wings\" on the\nbutterfly nuts. (Ordinary nuts and bolts would work as well, but require a wrench.) For transport, the wing nuts can be removed and the whole table packed flat.\nThe adjustable bed table made it easier for Osvaldo to do many activities in bed. He took particular pleasure in drawing. He began to confront the\nchallenge of learning to draw and write with his left hand.\nGames. Some of the school children who came to visit Osvaldo made a checker board for him. While playing such games with other children, often\nthe sign of a smile would creep over Osvaldo's face.\nThe main disadvantage of the table was its heavy weight and bulky size (as compared to the welded commercial hospital bed-tables that roll in from\none side of the bed).\nGURNEY (NARROW WHEELED BED) WITH ONE-HAND DRIVE\nProblem: To heal his pressure sores, Osvaldo needed to lie face-down for long periods. However, his paralyzed right arm was stiffly contracted\nover his chest. The arm was so hyper-sensitive that it would take a long time with therapy to regain enough flexibility to place it out of the way so\nthat he could lie face down.\n7 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nAnother problem was how to help Osvaldo regain flexibility (bending ability) of his hips and knees while lying face down. A special gurney could\nbe built for him with adjustable angles at the hips and knees. Actively moving about on the gurney would also stimulate circulation and thereby speed healing of the pressure sores.\nBut the biggest problem was: How could Osvaldo wheel and steer a gurney with one hand?\nSolution: A one-hand-drive gurney with adjustable hip and knee angles, and with a cut-out section and lower-level table for his\nparalyzed arm.\nA rectangle was cut out of the bed of the gurney at the level of Osvaldo's right shoulder, so his stiff arm could rest on a small, cushioned\ntable underneath.\nThe steering device for the one-arm-drive gurney\n8 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nA sliding knob is attached by a pivoting bar to a wire cable.\nThe knob slides up and down to change the angle of the rear wheel. It screws down tightly to hold the rear wheel in the desired position.\nThe cable, which passes through a series of D-rings, controls the angle of a single, small rear caster wheel.\nA lever arm, attached to the vertical post of the caster wheel, is pulled in one direction by the cable, and in the other direction by a spring.\nTo move straight ahead, Osvaldo tightens the steering knob to hold the rear wheel straight, and rolls the gurney by pushing the hand rim of the left big wheel. To make a turn, he\nquickly loosens the knob, slides it up or down to angle the caster wheel either to the left or right, and again locks the knob in place. The turn completed, he again moves the knob and\nlocks it in the straight-forward position.\nResults: Although it had certain problems and limitations, the gurney was a great success for Osvaldo. Through repeated experimentation,\nand a flood of complaints and suggestions by Osvaldo, the steering mechanism was gradually improved.\nAt first, too much force was required to make a right turn, and only a very wide turn was possible. But, by placing the D-ring (pulley)\nnearest the caster further back to provide a pull at closer to 90 degrees, sharper turns could be made, and made more easily. Also, at\nOsvaldo's insistence, a rack was added on the front of the gurney to hold a large bottle of water (see page 197). This request by Osvaldo\nreflected his growing interest in making sure he drank enough liquids to avoid further urinary infections.\n9 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nAt first it was very difficult to place Osvaldo on the gurney and to position his hyper-sensitive arm without hurting him. But after a few\ndays, the arm began to get a little more limber and the boy learned to help position both himself and his arm. Once in position, he was\nsoon able to stay comfortably on the gurney for hours.\nAs the angles of the gurney at Osvaldo's hips and knees were gradually increased, the flexibility of his joints improved rapidly. Osvaldo soon began to spend much of the time on the\ngurney with his hips fairly straight and his knees bent up. The elevated position of his feet helped to prevent them from swelling. This, in turn, helped his ankle sores to heal.\nIn summary:\nThe gurney contributed to Osvaldo's rehabilitation in a wide variety of ways:\nIt helped to heal his sores by removing the pressure on them (by his lying face down). Also, his energetic\nactivity on the gurney improved his circulation, which helped the sores to heal faster.\nIt protected his hypersensitive right hand by supporting it on a pillow below his body. But at the same\ntime, his activity on the gurney caused some movement of his delicate arm and hand. He tolerated this\nbecause his mind was on other things and he was having a good time. Gradually his hand became less\nsensitive, so that he cautiously began to move it, to wash it himself, and to gently do exercises to get back\nflexibility. (Although the hand remained paralyzed, some strength returned in his shoulder, and\neventually he started using it as a helping hand.)\nThe hinged bed of the gurney helped to correct the extension contractures of his hips and knees, by\ngradually increasing the bend of its jointed sections.\nWith its one-arm drive, the gurney allowed him the freedom of self-controlled and self-powered mobility.\nThis greatly improved his outlook on life and on himself.\nElevating his feet by flexing the hinge at his knees improved the circulation and decreased the swelling of his feet. (This speeded the healing of the\ndeep sores on his ankles.)\nBy encouraging physical activity and more drinking of water, the gurney helped to prevent urinary infection and kidney stones.\nWheeling himself around on the gurney helped to strengthen his more useful arm, providing therapy that was both functional and fun.\nAltogether, the gurney gave him new self-confidence and improved his state of mind. His greater happiness was due partly to being able to go where\nhe liked under his own power, and partly to his participation in designing and improving his own equipment.\nThe role model of other disabled persons who ride and work on gurneys helped a lot.\nA ONE-ARM-DRIVE WHEELCHAIR\nOnce Osvaldo's pressure sores had healed and he regained enough flexibility so that he could sit, he needed a one-hand-drive wheelchair.\nThe problem: Hemiplegic (one-hand drive) wheelchairs are manufactured commercially in the United States and in other rich countries. But they are very expensive and are usually not\navailable in poor countries. Also, the drive mechanism is relatively complex and tends to break down quickly on rough terrain. (The problems with these commercial one-arm-drive\nwheelchairs are further discussed in Chapter 39.)\nOccasionally, PROJIMO has a second-hand hemiplegic wheelchair donated from the cooperating hospitals and programs in the United States. But at the time Osvaldo needed one, none\n10 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nwas available.\nSolution: Like many rehabilitation programs in the Third World, PROJIMO has a big need for an easy-to-build, low-cost, hemiplegic wheelchair. It occurred to the workers in the shop\nthat the same front-wheel steering mechanism used for Osvaldo's gurney might work for a wheelchair.\nThrough a lot of trials and suggestions by Osvaldo, a design was created.\nA single front caster was controlled by pulleys and cable to a steering knob mounted on a vertical bracket on the left side of the chair.\nTrial construction, trouble-shooting, and improvements. In the early design, the very small D-rings (improvised front pulleys) gave too much resistance and made steering difficult.\nIn the modified design, larger, smoother-running pulleys were used. This made steering easier.\nPulling on the lock-knob required too much force for Osvaldo (whose back was still painful). Therefore a longer lever-arm was added.\nDesign details of Osvaldo's wheelchalr:\nResults:\n11 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nAfter several modifications to make steering easier, Osvaldo found the chair very useful. He learned to steer it with remarkable agility and became relatively independent. The strength\nin his left arm increased. The removable arm rest on the right side, plus the easy access for his feet, made putting him in and out of the chair relatively simple. He soon learned to help\nwith the transfers, using his left arm.\nOne disadvantage of this design is its lengthy forward extension to support the steering wheel. This makes moving about in close quarters more difficult (although far less so than the\nfront-wheel-drive tricycles with a bicycle wheel at the front, which are even longer and more cumbersome). On the positive side, the narrowness of the \"nose\" of Osvaldo's chair, and\nthe small front wheel, make moving about in close quarters somewhat easier.\nIn conclusion, the Osvaldo one-hand-drive wheelchair provided a relatively low-cost, easily constructed option in situations where standard hemiplegic chairs are seldom available, too\ncostly, and not durable. Although to our knowledge this new wheelchair has not yet been duplicated, we feel it has the potential to help fill the enormous unmet need of hemiplegic\nwheelchair riders in low-income situations. However, the design still needs to be simplified and improved. One possibility might be to shorten the forward extension to make it easier to\nmove about indoors.\nFor another, better design of a one-arm wheelchair, see the next chapter (page 253).\nSummary of the Combined Methods of Managing Osvaldo's Pressure Sores\nFollowing his accident Osvaldo lay on his back for 5 months without being turned. When he came to PROJIMO he had 11 pressure sores, extending from mid back to his heels. The\nlargest sores were 2 to 3 inches across. Most were fairly shallow (bone not exposed) and his mother had kept them fairly clean. However, there was some dead as well as unhealthy gray\ntissue on the surface of the sores. The deepest sore, about 2 inches long, was over the heel cord (Achilles tendon) of his left foot; the tendon was exposed.\nComplicating treatment of Osvaldo's pressure sores was his hypersensitive paralyzed right arm, which had become rigidly contracted over his chest. This stiff, painful arm prevented\nhim from lying either face down, or on his right side.\n12 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nSIX STEPS TAKEN TO PROMOTE HEALING OF OSVALDO'S PRESSURE SORES:\n1. Minimize pressure over the sores while lying down. This was done by:\nPutting cushions under his legs to take pressure off his buttocks, lower back, and ankles/heels.\nProviding a ring so he could lift himself up.\nUsing a thick sponge mattress.\n2. Adequate cleaning of the sores; treatment with sugar and honey.\n3. Wheeled mobility while lying face down, with the feet up (until the sores heal).\n4. Lots of activity to speed up circulation, which causes faster healing.\n5. Food rich in calories, protein, and iron to strengthen the body and blood, to speed healing.\n6. Management of the boy's overall health, especially his urinary system.\n7. Strengthening the good arm and increasing his ability to change his position.\n13 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nMEDICAL TREATMENT OF OSVALDO'S PRESSURE SORES\nTreatment involved daily washings, at first brisk enough to remove dead flesh. Once the healthy red flesh was exposed, cleansing became quite gentle so as to\navoid damage to the newly forming tissues. After cleaning the sores, a paste of bees' honey mixed with sugar was applied to the sores and covered lightly with\ngauze (see page 156).\nResults: With this treatment program, combined with the management techniques reviewed on page 251, the sores healed remarkably fast. Even the deep sore\nover Osvaldo's heel healed in 3 weeks. The team feels it was the combined actions of treatment and management that led to rapid healing. Surely the change in\nOsvaldo's attitude made a big difference. He began to oversee and take responsibility for his own care, advising his mother and other attendants about how to place padding to relieve\npressure over bony areas, and asking to be turned or moved after a time in one position. His increased physical activity also probably contributed to his quick healing, as did the many\nhours he spent each day lying face-down on his specially designed gurney.\nComparison of PROJIMO's methods with hospital treatment of Osvaldo's pressure sores.\nThe steel rods surgically placed in Osvaldo's back after his accident came loose, and had\nCOMPARISON OF HEALING TIME OF SIMILAR PRESSURE SORES ON\nbegun to poke through the skin. To remove the rods, Osvaldo was taken to an orthopedic\nOSVALDO'S BACKSIDE\nhospital in California. During the 2-day drive, a new small pressure sore formed over his\nsacrum (bottom part of the spine). In the hospital, Duoderm (a costly, medicated, absorbent\nbandage) was put over the sore, and Osvaldo was placed in bed for 24 hours a day. He lay\non his back on a special air-flow mattress run by an electric air-pump, so that the pressure\nover each small area of the body was constantly changing.\nIn the hospital, with all this costly treatment and equipment, the boy in his space-age bed\nwas deprived of all choice or responsibility for his own care. His pressure sore - smaller and\nmore superficial than ones that had healed in 3 weeks at PROJIMO - took over 2 months to\nheal.\nIronically, from lying flat on his back for so long in the hospital, Osvaldo's knees and hips\nwere again becoming rigid. A physiotherapist, attempting to restore flexibility, used too\nmuch force and broke his right leg. With his leg in a cast for weeks, a new deep pressure\nsore formed on his right heel. Again, it took over 2 months to heal. During all these months\nin the hospital, Osvaldo's anger, hostility, and depression - which he had gradually been\novercoming - re-emerged. The nurses were at a loss for knowing how to get him to\ncooperate.\nComparing results of Osvaldo's management at PROJIMO with those at this modern\northopedic hospital, it appears that the comprehensive, action-oriented, whole-person\napproach used at the village center was relatively successful - at least for the healing rate of\npressure sores. The rapid healing, achieved with Osvaldo's sores has occurred with many\n(but not all) persons attended at PROJIMO. More comparative study is needed.\nGo back to the CONTENTS\n14 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 38)\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nby David Werner\nPublished by\nHealthWrights\nWorkgroup for People's Health and Rights\nPost Office Box 1344\nPalo Alto, CA 94302, USA\nCopyright 1998 by David Werner\n15 of 15\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 39)\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nPART FOUR\nWHEELS TO FREEDOM\nCHAPTER 39\nA One-Hand-Drive Wheelchair\nfor Che: A Challenge for Martin\nCHE was a policeman until the fateful night he was shot. He and his drinking buddies had decided to play \"Russian Roulette,\" a deadly game where\nmen point a six-shooter pistol with just one bullet in it at each other's head, pull the trigger, and see who gets shot first! Che lost. The bullet left him\nparalyzed on the left side of his body (hemiplegic).\nLuckily, Che's mind and speech were unaffected. He was given a standard wheelchair. But with the use of only one arm, he needed assistance to go\nanywhere.\nChe spent months at PROJIMO for rehabilitation and to learn new skills. A commercial one-arm-drive\nwheelchair from the United States had been donated to the program. Che loved it, and tried to go everywhere in\nit. But it kept breaking down.\nCommercial one-arm-drive wheelchairs always break. Factory-made hemiplegic (one-arm-drive)\nwheelchairs are very expensive and seldom seen in poor countries. They have design problems which limit their usefulness. They are built for\nsmooth hospital floors, not village paths. On rough terrain, they repeatedly break - and are hard and costly to fix.\nThis commercial design is nothing like Osvaldo's one-arm-drive chair made at PROJIMO (see\npage 249). In the commercial chair, the rider delivers power to both rear wheels with one hand.\nThe two hand-rims, one next to and slightly smaller than the other, are mounted on one side of\nthe chair. One rim is fixed to the wheel on that side. The other is connected by a central axle\n(transverse rod) to the opposite wheel. To move straight ahead, the rider grips both hand-rims at\nonce. To make a turn, he pushes just one hand-rim.\nThe weakness of the commercial chair is that the axle that transfers power from one side to the other is too thin. It passes (on\nball bearings) through the center of the wheel hub on the near side, and is welded to the hub on the far side. Unfortunately, the axle\ncannot be replaced by a thicker, stronger one because of the small hub-hole it goes through. When modestly stressed, the fragile axle\nbreaks.\nNeed for a Rugged, Low-Cost, One-Hand-Drive Wheelchair. PROJIMO sees a lot of persons who need a one-hand-drive wheelchair.\nThese include folks who have had a stroke or suffered a head injury (like Che), and children with \"hemiplegic\" cerebral palsy.\nOsvaldo's chair with front-wheel steering allowed him to move about town independently and helped him to recover self-direction and the will to live. The design was simple, low cost,\n1 of 3\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 39)\nand fairly easy to make, But that chair had one big disadvantage. Like hand-driven tricycles, it took up a lot of space. Indoors, it was cumbersome. There was a need for a one-arm chair\nthat was cheap, road-worthy, and compact.\nMartin Perez Designs a Stronger One-Arm-Drive Wheelchair\nMARTIN, the paraplegic wheelchair builder whose gurney is featured in Chapter 37, was aware of the need for a reliable, one-arm-drive\nwheelchair. Time and again, he had welded and tried to strengthen the weak axle of Che's commercial chair. He also realized that, if the\npower-transfer mechanism broke while the rider was climbing a steep ramp or trail, it could be dangerous.\nDuring Martin's visit to California, while recovering from surgery, he stayed in the home of wheel-chair designer, Ralf Hotchkiss. When Ralf was\naway teaching, Martin used Ralf's workshop, which is beautifully adapted for working from a wheelchair (see page 195). One day, Martin began\nto design and build a one-arm-drive wheelchair that would be compact and low-cost, yet strong.\nIn building the wheelchair frame, Martin followed Ralf's basic Whirlwind design. For the\none-arm-drive mechanism, he used features from the commercial design, but with a\nmuch thicker and stronger transverse rod (axle) to transfer power from a hand-rim on one\nside of the chair to the wheel on the far side.\nTesting the strength of the new mechanism. When the\nchair was done, Martin and Ralf tested the strength of the\none-arm-drive mechanism. They hooked a spring scale to\nthe far wheel, and with a block-and-tackle put increasing\nforce on the hand-rim that powered it. To their joy,\nMartin's heavy-duty axle-rod withstood over 200 pounds\nof force before it broke. This is much stronger than the\ncommercial hemiplegic system (which breaks at about 30\npounds of force).\nGo back to the CONTENTS\nNothing About Us Without Us\nDeveloping Innovative Technologies\nFor, By and With Disabled Persons\nby David Werner\nPublished by\nHealthWrights\nWorkgroup for People's Health and Rights\nPost Office Box 1344\nPalo Alto, CA 94302, USA\n2 of 3\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html\n\nNothing About Us Without US - Part Four(Chapter 39)\nCopyright 1998 by David Werner\n3 of 3\n2/17/2007 9:33 PM\nhttp://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00137.html"
