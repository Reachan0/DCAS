  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLecture/lab sessions: 5 sessions / week, 4 hours / session.\n\nThis course lasts for one week, meeting on five consecutive days. The first three sessions are a mix of lecture and lab time, while the final two sessions are just lab time.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome to the first DIY Geiger counter class! You are embarking on an educational experiment, designed to provide a hands-on, interactive introduction to Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) at MIT. Rather than bore you with lectures, we believe that direct, physical engagement is the best way to jump right into a new and unfamiliar subject. Everything that we present on the board, you will be exploring and proving using your own hand-built Geiger counters. You will explore different types and sources of radiation, how to detect them, how to shield them, how to accurately count / measure their activity, and explore cryptographical applications of radiation. This course is meant to be enjoyable and rigorous at the same time.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nWe hope you will learn and put to use a diverse set of skills, both theoretical and practical, by the end of this course. While we will cover many topics during this course, most will be at an intuitive, freshman-accessible level for the sake of time and ease of learning. Specific objectives of this course include:\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nTypes of radiation\n\nAlpha\n(α)\nparticles: Charged, heavy helium nuclei\n\nBeta\n(β)\nparticles: Electrons originating from the nucleus\n\nGamma\n(γ)\nrays: High energy photons\n\nNeutrons (n): Uncharged nucleons\n\nOthers (neutrinos, anti-particles...)\n\nSources of radiation\n\nNatural sources: Cosmic rays, terrestrial isotopes\n\nMan-made sources: Medical procedures, consumer products, nuclear power, fallout\n\nNuclear reaction energetics\n\nPredicting type and energy of radiation\n\nPrinciples of radiation shielding\n\nTime & distance\n\nShielding, logarithmic attenuation\n\nEnergy deposition, exposure rates\n\nDetector theory and limitations, specifically Geiger counters\n\nPrinciples of operation\n\nDead time\n\nStatistics, uncertainty, and error analysis\n\nCalculating uncertainty\n\nPropagating errors\n\nDetermining how long to count\n\nReal-life implementation\n\nCircuit theory\n\nAdditional sources of error and dead time\n\nLaboratory Objectives\n\nLearn how to solder and assemble circuits\n\nDevelop testing and debugging skills\n\nUnderstand sources of experimental error\n\nPlan experimental procedures for faster success\n\nLogistics\n\nStudents should expect 2 to 4 hours of homework per night.\n\nThe course grade is based on laboratory reports, problem sets, and a completed working Geiger counter. There are no exams.\n\nHomework Assignments\n\nSince this course is only one week long, we had to get creative with homework assignments. Therefore, we have constructed the following rules for this course:\n\nAll assignments are due two class days after they are assigned, to give you time to ask questions.\n\nHomework assignments may look short, but they will require you to research things and think creatively.\n\nAlways cite your sources of information\n! This includes journal articles, books, databases, and websites. We will use this formatting guide for references:\n\nSummary and examples from the American Chemical Society (ACS) Style Guide\n. University of Wisconsin-Madison Chemistry Library.\n\nYou may prepare your answers however you like, but they must be submitted electronically.\n\nYou may work together in any sized group. If you do, you must clearly write with whom you worked.\n\nThere are two types of homework assignments: Problem Sets and a Lab Report.\n\nFor problem sets, just answer the questions to the best of your ability.\nBe quantitative\n, use numerical justification whenever possible. For example, if we ask you why one shouldn't ingest things that emit alpha particles, just saying \"alphas are bad for you\" or \"they release lots of radiation, which is dangerous\" is not sufficient. Instead, give an answer like: \"Alpha particles have very short ranges, but they do\nTons\nof damage to tissues due to their high mass and charge. Therefore, while one's skin would normally shield against alpha particles, ingesting alpha-emitters puts the alpha particles right next to the cells which they can damage.\"\n\nFor lab reports, also just answer the questions completely and thoroughly. We recommend using your answers from the problem sets, as well as information from the lecture slides and primary sources (journal articles, NIST databases) to complete the lab reports.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem sets (all together)\n\n25%\n\nLab report\n\n25%\n\nSuccessfully building the Geiger counter\n\n50%\n\nTips for Success\n\nThis course may look jam-packed with things to learn and assignments to do, but it really isn't. All the assignments are designed to:\n\nDrill you in the mathematical and intuitive techniques taught during class;\n\nGet you thinking more deeply about using your new knowledge to solve open-ended problems;\n\nGet you to pre-compile information for the lab reports.\n\nTherefore, if you do the readings, the assignments should be relatively easy. If you do well on the assignments, the lab reports should be very easy!\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nREAD BEFORE CLASSES\n\nLECTURES\n\nLABS\n\nHOMEWORKS\n\nRadiation decay chains, half-life (42 pages)\n\nRadiation basics; radiation energetics (2 hours)\n\nGeiger counter circuits (1 hour)\n\nStart building! (1 hour)\n\nWrite analysis script\n\nGC theory, dead time (16 pages)\n\nGeiger tube theory, dead time (1 hour)\n\nBuild GC (3 hours)\n\nShielding, range, dose (15 pages)\n\nShielding and range; radiation protection (1 hour)\n\nBuild GC (3 hours)\n\nPset 1 due\n\nError, uncertainty (21 pages)\n\nNo lecture\n\nDose, shielding, background (4 hours)\n\nPset 2 due\n\nNo reading\n\nNo lecture\n\nFinish Geiger counter lab (4 hours)\n\nAs time allows, build a random number generator for cryptography\n\nPset 3 due\n\nLab report due 3 days later",

What do you expect to happen if you keep raising the Geiger tube voltage waaay beyond the saturation\nregion, and why?\n2. We have noticed that the Geiger tubes still \"work\" even when bent or dented. How do you expect their\noperation to change when the tube gets dented, and why? Be specific about things like the current,\nthe minimum operating voltage, the plateau voltage, and very high voltages based on your answer to\nProblem 1.1.\n(15 points) Predicting Dead Time Response\nBelow are two hypothetical count rate distributions: one low (background counting), one high (counting\nnear a source). These distributions were gathered on a detector with a negligibly low dead time:\nCounting background levels\nCounting near an intense source\nNow suppose you were to collect similar distributions from a detector with a high (5ms) dead time.\nSketch the expected change in each distribution, for both a paralyzable and a non-paralyzable detector (four\nsketches in total).\n(40 points) Dead Time Experimental Design\nDesign an experiment to measure the dead time τ of your Geiger tube. Be as specific and quantitative as you\ncan, use formulas from the reading to inform your experiment. Approximately what minimum count rate\n(not activity, we'll do that later) will you require in order to produce 10% dead time in your experiment?\n(30 points) More Sources of \"Dead Time\"\nWe are going to use a computer to register our counts, to automatically produce the distributions in Problem\n2.

In order for it to slip by unnoticed, the activity measured on a perfectly efficient,\n0.01 m2radiation detector must be within 2x of the local natural background levels.\n1. Design a shielding system to fit inside the shipping container, that will hide the source from the\ndetector. Disregard cost, and try to minimize the volume of the shielding.\n2. Revisit your design in Problem 2.1, but take cost into account. Which materials would you switch to,\nassuming you may fill the entire shipping container if you so desire?\n(60 points) Pre-Lab Calculations\nUsing actual data from your Geiger counter (tube materials, gases, plastic thickness), determine an exper-\niment to measure the efficiency of your SMB-20 Geiger tube using our Co-60 source. In other words, how\nmany gamma rays do you expect to interact with (not just enter) the gases in your Geiger tube, compared\nto the actual number of counts that you measure? You will want to use your answers in Problem Set 1\nconcerning actual source activity and uncertainty, and use/make measurements of your own Geiger counter.\nLook at slide 19 of today's lecture notes for inspiration, though your experiment may not look exactly like\nthis...\nBe creative! You don't necessarily have to use the Geiger counter in exactly the way it was meant to be\nused... also, do account for things like dead time, true source activity uncertainty, and other sources of dead\ntime in the experiment from Problem Set 2.\nYour answer should be an expression for the efficiency of your GM tube as a function of other known\nand measurable parameters in an experiment. You will actually perform this experiment on Thursday.\nYou may find this online database most useful: http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/xraycoef/\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.S902 Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Geiger Counters\nJanuary IAP 2015\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

As a high-energy alpha\npasses through matter, it slows down through many such interactions with the light\nelectrons. Because any given interaction is very small, the particle trajectory tends\nto be mostly straight. The range of alpha particles is fairly short - in air, a 2 MeV\nalpha has a mean range of only about 1 cm! Hence, detectors for alpha radiation\nmust have a very thin wall - often mica with a thickness of around 0.001′′ is used,\nsee Figure 3 for examples. The SBM-20 tubes we will be using have steel walls that\nare too thick to be used for alpha radiation.\nThere are two forms of beta decay. In β-decay, a neutron in the nucleus essentially\nsplits into a proton, an electron and a neutrino, thereby increasing the atomic number\nof the decaying nucleus. In β+ decay, a proton in the nucleus essentially splits into a\nneutron, a positron (anti-electron) and a neutrino, thereby decreasing the atomic\nnumber of the nucleus. Electrons also interact primarily with the electrons in the\nabsorbing material. Because the masses are equal in this case, any given interaction\ncan cause a large change in the trajectory - thus electron tracks meander more than\nthose of alpha particles. Fast electrons also lose energy by emitting light in a process\nknown as bremsstrahlung. Electrons typically have much longer ranges than alpha\nparticles, and hence can be seen by the SBM-20 GM tubes we will be using.\nFollowing a radioactive decay, a nucleus is often left in an excited state. When\nthis state decays, a very high energy photon is emitted in what is called gamma\ndecay. Photons can lose their energy through several mechanisms: photoelectric\nNSE: Build your own Geiger-Muller counter\n(c) Wikipedia user N. Manytchkine. License CC BY-\nSA.

Gamma rays also have long ranges and hence can be detected\nby the SBM-20 GM tubes we will be using. You can tell the difference between beta\nand gamma radiation based on how easy it is to block with a high-Z absorber such\nas lead - gamma will penetrate the barrier more readily than beta.\nPrinciples of Soldering\nSafety Note: Solder contains lead - be sure to wash your hands after handling\nsolder, and do not solder near food or drink!\nSafety Note: Molten solder can be flung towards you if a component slips. Al-\nways wear eye protection when soldering!\nElectronics are assembled using solder, alloys designed to have a low melting point,\nhigh electrical conductivity and good mechanical properties. The solder we will be\nusing is 60% tin and 40% lead. The following tips will help you to make a secure\njoint every time:\n- Before you apply solder to a joint, make sure the joint is mechanically stable.\nFor example, when soldering to a circuit board, bend the leads outwards once\nthey are through the hole.\n- Clean the iron's tip on a moist sponge or brass sponge before and after making\neach joint.\n- Put a small amount of solder on the tip of the iron right before touching it to\nthe part - this will help to conduct heat to the part.\n- Make sure the tip of the iron contacts both parts to be connected - you need\nthem both hot to make a good joint!\n- Feed the solder into the joint from opposite where the iron touches - if the\nsolder doesn't melt, then you probably haven't gotten the joint hot enough.\n- Don't overheat parts - a few seconds should do it. If you can't get the solder\nto melt as described above within about ten seconds or less, take the iron away,\nclean the tip and put more solder at the tip of the iron to help conduct heat\nbetter.\n- A good solder joint should be shiny and \"wetted\" to the surface, not dull and\n\"balled up\" on the surface - see Figure 4.\n(a) good\nbeaded up\n×\nFigure 4: Cross-section\nof good versus bad solder\njoint.\nsolder is dull\n(b) bad\nNSE: Build your own Geiger-Muller counter\n\nResistors\nResistors are one of the fundamental building blocks of electronics. As implied by\nthe name, they resist the flow of c urrent. Given a current I , a resistor of value R\ndevelops a potential difference V = IR across it (Ohm's law). The value of a resistor\nis indicated by the color code shown in Figure 5.\n4 7 ×100 ±5%\n= 4.7 kΩ ± 5%\n1 0 0×10k±1%\n= 1.00 MΩ ± 1%\ncolor\nband 1\nband 2\n(band 3)\nmultiplier\ntolerance\nblack\n1 Ω\nbrown\n10 Ω\n±1%\nred\n100 Ω\n±2%\norange\n1 kΩ\nyellow\n10 kΩ\ngreen\n100 kΩ\n±0.5%\nblue\n1 MΩ\n±0.25%\nviolet\n10 MΩ\n±0.1%\ngrey\n(100 MΩ)\n±0.05%\nwhite\ngold\n0.1 Ω\n±5%\nsilver\n0.01 Ω\n±10%\nFigure 5: Resistor color code\nchart. The value of the re-\nsistor is indicated by two or\nthree value bands, a multi-\nplier band and a tolerance\nband. Note that 1% and\n2% resistors are ambigu-\nous as brown and red are\nvalid as both tolerance and\nvalue bands - always double-\ncheck the value of precision\nresistors!\nCapacitors\nCapacitors are another fundamental building block of electronics. A capacitor stores\ncharge: given a capacitor of capacitance C charged to a potential V, the charge stored\nis Q = CV. The value of the capacitors we will be using is indicated by a three-digit\nnumber code that works similarly to the resistor color code described above: the\nfirst two digits are the first two digits of the value and the third digit is the power\nof ten multiplier to get the capacitance in picofarads (1 pF = 10-12 F). For example,\nthe code \"224\" means 22 × 104 pF = 220 nF.\nInductors\nInductors are the third fundamental building block of electronics. An inductor\nresponds to changes in current: given an inductor of inductance L with time-varying\ncurrent I flowing through it, the voltage is V = LdI/dt. The value of the inductor we\nwill be using is indicated by a three-digit number code that works very much like\nthe capacitor code described above: the first two digits are the first two digits of the\nvalue and the third digit is the power of ten multiplier to get the inductance in\nmicrohenries (1 μH = 10-6 H). For example, the code \"102\" means 10 × 102 μH =\n1 mH.\nNSE: Build your own Geiger-Muller counter\n\nAssembling the Geiger-Muller Counter\nThe circuit diagram is shown in Figure 6. The parts needed are shown in Figure 7 and\nparts lists broken down by subassembly are given at each step. You will be assembling\nthe circuit on a printed circuit board (PCB), the top of which is shown in Figure 8.\nIn the subsequent steps, components involved in the active step will be shown in full\ncolor and components that have already been installed but are unimportant for the\nstep at hand will be shown as black silhouettes.\nTip: Always disconnect the battery when done testing - you don't want to wreck\nyour circuit by shorting it out!\nTip: When testing, always make sure the board is supported such that there is\nnothing shorting any connections out on it - this includes your hands as well as\nany debris on your workbench. The two safest approaches are to grip the edges\nof the board with the work holder such that the board is held offthe workbench\nor to put standoffs in the mounting holes at the corners of the board.\nTip: With components that start out with short leads that you can't bend to hold\nthe part in place, it sometimes helps to use a small piece of tape to hold the part\nin place while soldering.\nSafety Note: When using wire cutters, wire fragments can be flung with enough\nforce to injure your eyes. Keep your eye protection on while trimming leads.\nAnother useful tip is to hold your hand over the area where you are cutting to\ncatch the leads as you trim them.\nTroubleshooting Tips\nIf a circuit doesn't work as expected, check the following:\n1. Make sure the correct components have been placed in the correct spots.\n2. Check the orientation of diodes, transistors and chips with respect to the\nsilkscreen outline.\n3. Make sure that adjacent pads didn't become shorted together (\"bridged\")\nduring soldering.\n4. Make sure you are making the measurement properly: always hook the ground\nof your scope and the \"COM\" lead of your meter to the \"GND\" pin or one of\nthe grounded mounting holes in the corners of the board.\nNSE: Build your own Geiger-Muller counter\n\n1_GND\n8_VCC\n2_TRIG\n3_OUT\n6_THR\n7_DIS\n5_CTRL\n4_RES\n+\n-\nVCC\nGND\nVI\nVO\n1_OUT\n8_GND\n2_VCC\n3_COMP\n6_DTC\n7_RT\n5_SCP\n4_FB\nFigure 6: Full schematic for\nthe GM counter.\nNSE: Build your own Geiger-Muller counter\n\nFigure 7: Parts of the GM\ncounter.\n(a) top view with traces\nFigure 8: The board has\ntwo layers - in (a) the top\nlayer is shown as red and\nthe bottom layer is shown\nas blue.

You will start by calculating the efficiency of your Geiger counter tubes, which\nis a yet unknown quantity. Next you will characterize the dead time in various parts of your circuit, and\nexperimentally determine whether they are paralyzable or non-paralyzable. Next you will determine whether\nour lab equipment consists of a \"good\" geometry, by comparing the as-is setup to one with a better-known\ngood geometry that you will construct. Next, you will re-derive fundamental laws of distance vs. dose,\nshielding vs. dose, and type/energy of radiation vs. dose. Finally, you will characterize the activity of\nunknown sources using your Geiger counters. The amount of radioactivity found in certain common items\nmay surprise you!\nNotice just how much work is required in order to fully characterize a radiation detector. These are not\nplug-and-play devices, so to speak!\nPlease complete this activity in pairs, to conserve sources and to help get to know each other. You may\nrepeat experiments together with each of your Geiger counters.\nNotes on This Lab\nPlease notice that we don't explicitly tell you exactly how to complete the lab. Instead, we guide you through\nwhich calculations to make in a useful order, but we don't tell you precisely how to perform the experiment.\nWe want you to think about how you will perform the experiment, what sources of error may exist, and\nhow you can best avoid and/or account for them. For example, when we say \"determine the background\ncount rate,\" you must know to account for nearby sources of radioactivity (such as other students' ongoing\nexperiments), and you must choose how long to count for to obtain adequate statistics.\nSetting Up\nYou will need to connect your Geiger to the computer, using the NI Elvis systems and the software which we\nhave provided. If you haven't already, download and install the MIT NSE Geiger Counter program on your\nlaboratory computers.\nPlease also head to http://www.gnumeric.org/ to install a free, open source spreadsheet program,\nwritten specifically for mathematics and engineering.\nNext, you will have to temporarily remove the Geiger counter cases to attach probes between the NI Elvis\nsystem and your Geiger counter. The image displayed on the MITNSECounter.exe program instructs you\nwhere to attach your probes.\nFinally, before you turn your Geiger counters on, cover the positive (+) end of your Geiger tube with\nelectrical tape. This will help you avoid a very painful, 400V electric shock!\n\nKey Calculations\nFill in these values as you calculate or discover them. It will be helpful to have them all in one place.\nNumber\nValue (Units)\nUncertainty\nRoom Background Count Rate\nSource Used for Initial Experiments\nTrue 60Co Source Activity from Mar. 2011\nExpected Count Rate at 100% Efficiency\nTube Solid Angle 1\" from Source\nTrue Geiger Tube Efficiency at 400V\nTrue Geiger Tube Efficiency at 350V\nTrue Geiger Tube Efficiency at 450V\nGeiger Tube Dead Time\nPulse Stretcher Dead Time\nBuildup Factor of Your Chosen \"Bad\" Setup\nExpected Activity of Bag of KCl Road Salt\nMeasured Activity of Bag of KCl Road Salt\nExpected Activity of Two Humans\nCalculated Activity of Two Humans\n(10 points) Background Counts\nUsing your Geiger counter, Determine the background count rate in the laboratory. You will have to choose\na suitable counting time, based on the number and statistical quality of the counts that you get. Make\nmultiple measurements after counting for 1, 3, and 5 minutes. Repeat the 1 minute count rate three times:\nBackground counts/min at 1 minute:\nBackground counts/min at 3 minutes:\nBackground counts/min at 5 minutes:\nWhat sources of error exist in your measurements? Now quickly look at the reading for Day 4 (I'm\nassuming you've started this lab on Day 3). Start on p. 321. Based on your count rate, how long would you\nhave to count to be 95% confident in your background count rate?\nSources of Error:\nTime to 95% confident background count rate:\nIf required, perform your background count rate calibration at this time. Use this value in the remaining\nexperiments.\n\n(10 Points) Source Characterization\nFor this experiment, you will want to use the two 60Co sources. One has a very precise date stamp, while\nthe other does not.\nFrom Problem Set 1, write down the activities and uncertainties of the two 60Co sources:\nOld 60Co source:\n±\nNew 60Co source:\n±\nNow obtain count rates for both sources, by counting for a suitable amount of time using each source\n(one at a time) at a distance of 3\". This is done to reduce the percent dead time in our Geiger counter, by\nkeeping the count rate relatively low. Based on the stated activities, the calculated old source activity, and\nthe measured count rates for both sources, what is the true activity of the new 60Co source? Based on this\nnumber, what is the expected day of calibration of the newer source?\nNew 60Co source count rate:\n±\nNew 60Co source activity:\n±\nNew 60Co source day of calibration:\n±\nDo not forget to subtract your background count rate from these figures!\n\n(10 points) Geiger Tube Characterization\nNow we will figure out what percentage of the gamma rays that interact with the gases in our Geiger tubes\nactually get counted.\nFirst, assuming that you place a source of true activity A ± ∆A of your choice at a distance of 1\" away\nfrom the Geiger tube, calculate the expected count rate in your Geiger tube. You will need to determine the\nsolid angle of your tube relative to the source, as well as any shielding from materials between the Geiger\ntube and the source.\nNext, place the source of your choice 1\" away from your Geiger tube, and measure the count rate for a\nsuitable amount of time. Record the net count rate from the source.\nFinally, determine the ratio between these expected and measured count rates. This is your tube effi-\nciency, for this source! Tube efficiencies will vary for different types and energies of radiation.\nExpected count rate:\n±\nMeasured count rate:\n±\nTube efficiency:\n±\nRepeat this exercise, but this time use the plastic screwdriver to vary your Geiger tube voltage between\n350-450V, in increments of 25V. Graph your tube efficiency for your source as a function of voltage:\nRepeat this exercise only at 400V, except use a different source. How can you explain the differences in\ntube efficiencies?\n\n(10 points) Characterizing Dead Time\nPlace a source as close as you can to your Geiger tube. If you haven't yet, you may want to place black\nelectrical tape over the blue speaker now. Acquire counting statistics for 2 minutes.\nNow repeat this exercise, except change your positive (red) probe to a location on the output of the pulse\nstretcher. Based on the distributions of count arrival times that you measure, what is the dead time in the\nGeiger tube? What about the pulse stretcher? How do you know?\nNow look closely at the shapes of the distributions of count rates for very short times (near the dead\ntime). What do the shapes of the distributions tell you about the paralyzability of the Geiger tube? What\nabout the pulse stretcher?\n(20 points) MacGyvering a \"Good\" Geometry\nIn all your previous experiments, we were assuming that we had a \"good\" geometry. In other words, we\nassumed that any beta/gamma ray that underwent an interaction of any kind (absorption, scattering...) left\nthe beam. This is not actually the case.\nExplain, using sketches if it helps, why our current geometry is not \"good.\" Think about possible ways\nby which beta/gamma rays from our sources may enter the Geiger tube.\nBased on your explanation above, and using anything that you can find in/near the laboratory room,\nconstruct and test a \"good\" geometry setup. Make sure not to actually shield the source, rather try to\nensure that fewer scattered beta/gamma rays will enter your detector. Sketch or take a picture of it below:\nNow, using a source of your choice, measure the count rates using your \"good\" and \"bad (original) ge-\nometries. By what factor do they differ? This is what is known as a buildup factor. What is causing the\nbuildup factor to be greater than one in our bad geometry? What esle could you do (given infinite resources)\nto ensure a \"good\" geometry, better than the one you constructed?\n\n(10 points) Experimentally Deriving Distance Laws\nNow we will see if the supposed\nthe\nr2 distance vs. dose scaling law holds true in\nlaboratory. Using a source\nof your choice, and using our original \"bad\" geometry, measure count rates at the seven distances marked\non your fiberboard jig. These holes were cut to help reduce uncertainty in distance measurements. Graph\nthe relationship between distance from the source and measured count rate:\nHow close is your measured relationship to the expected\n1 ?\nr2\nNow repeat your measurements for your\n\"good\" geometry. How much closer did you get?\n\n(10 points) Experimentally Deriving Percent Dead Time\nWe have already characterized the dead time τ in our Geiger counters. Now we will figure out what our\npercent dead time is at different count rates.\nLook carefully at the count interval distributions for the experiments in Problem 6. The dead time of the\nGeiger counter should be quite evident. How will you estimate the percent dead time in your measurements,\nand your graph above? Produce a graph of count rate vs. percent dead time from your results:\n\n(20 points) Measuring Linear Attenuation Coefficients\nIn front of you are 4-5 pieces of 0.075\" thick commercially pure titanium. Don't look up the value of its\nlinear attenuation coefficient just yet.\nChoose a distance on your experimental jig with a suitably low (<5%) percent dead time from Problem\n7. Using our original \"bad\" geometry, place the source of your choice at this location, and measure count\nrates with between 0-4 pieces of Ti shielding between your source and your detector. Place the Ti shielding\nvery close to the source. You will have to choose how long to count in each case. Plot the count rate vs.\nshielding thickness below:\nNow repeat the experiment, except put the Ti shielding as close as possible to the Geiger tube. Plot\nthese values on your graph above.\nFinally, repeat this experiment using a \"good\" geometry. Plot these values on your graph above. What\nare your buildup factors with the Ti shielding close to the source, and close to the detector, compared with\nthe \"good\" geometry? Write down the experimentally determined linear attenuation coefficient for Ti and\nyour source's beta/gamma energy, compared to the measured value:\nPercent dead time\nμT i with Ti near source:\n±\nμT i with Ti near detector:\n±\nμT i with \"good\" geometry:\n±\nμT i, true value:\n(20 points extra) Determining Unknown Source Activities\nRoad deicing salt, commonly made of KCl, has a certain fraction of naturally occurring 40K. Calculate\nthe expected activity of the bag of KCl road salt. Now measure it using your Geiger counter, while doing\nwhatever you need to ensure low dead time, good geometry, accurate background subtraction, and anything\nelse you need to quantify uncertainty. Note here that the bag of KCl is not a point source!\nAlso note that humans contain potassium, some of which is 40K. Calculate the expected activity of two\nhumans (yes, your dose does increase next to other people!). Now try to measure it. Based on your expected\n(calculated) activity, should you be able to measure the activity of two humans using our Geiger counters?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.S902 Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Geiger Counters\nJanuary IAP 2015\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Charge is measured in units of coulombs (C).\ncurrent The flow of charge through a wire or component. Current is measured in\namperes (1 A > 1 C0s). Recall that an electron has a charge of -1.6 · 10-19 C:\na current of 1 A corresponds to many electrons flowing per second!\nvoltage The potential energy per unit charge. The units are volts (1 V > 1 +0C).\nCircuits are built up of components that manipulate the current and voltage in the\ndesired manner. The most fundamental three components are:\nresistors Resist the flow of current: they dissipate the energy carried by the cur-\nrent. The voltage across a resistor is given by Ohm's law: 7 > I3, where the\nresistance 3 is measured in units of ohms (volts per ampere, 1 Ω > 1 V0A).\n+\n-\nI\ncapacitors Store charge: the charge stored on a capacitor is 2 > C7, where C is the\ncapacitance and is given in units of farads (1 F > 1 C0V). The time derivative\nof charge stored is the current through the capacitor: I > C d70dt. Note\nthat the voltage across a capacitor must be continuous, otherwise an infinite\ncurrent would be required!\n+\n-\n7s\nt>0\nC\n+\n-\nI\ninductors Store magnetic flux: the flux in an inductor is Υ > -I, where - is the induc-\ntance and is given in units of henries (1 H > 1 Wb0A > 1 V s0A). The voltage\nacross the inductor is the time derivative of the flux: 7 > dΥ0dt > - dI0dt.\nNote that the current through an inductor must be continuous, otherwise an\ninfinite voltage would be present!\n+\n-\n7s\nt>0\n-\n+\n-\nI\nGeiger-Muller counter circuit theory\n\n3: HV supply: the boost converter\nThe boost converter takes the 9 V battery voltage and steps it up to 400 V. This is\naccomplished using an inductor and another very important component: the diode,\na component which only permits current to flow in one direction. A basic boost\nconverter looks like this:\n+\n-\nVs\nL\nC\nload\n+\n-\nVHV\nThe switch turns on and off rapidly, staying on for duration ton and off for duration\ntoff each time.\nConsider the case when the switch is closed:\n+\n-\nVs\nL\n+\n-\nVL\nIL\nC\nload\n+\n-\nVHV\nThere can be no current through the diode in this case, so the capacitor is what\nprovides current to the load. The voltage across the inductor is equal to the supply\nvoltage: VL = Vs. So, the current in the inductor is increasing according to\ndIL\nVs\ntonVs\n=\n→ ΔIL,on =\ndt\nL\nL\nNow, open the switch:\n+\n-\nVs\nL\n+\n-\nVL\nIL\nC\nload\n+\n-\nVHV\nRecall that there can be no discontinuity in the inductor current - the current now\nflows through the diode to both charge the capacitor and power the load. But, the\nvoltage is free to change instantly: it is now given by VL = Vs - VHV. During this\nperiod the current in the inductor therefore drops according to\ndIL\nVs - VHV\ntoff(Vs - VHV)\n=\n=\n→ ΔIL,off\ndt\nL\nL\nFor the circuit to operate in steady-state, the current must come back to the same\nvalue after each cycle:\nΔIL,on = -ΔIL,off → tonVs = -toff(Vs - VHV) → ton + toff = VHV =\n1 ,\nL\nL\ntoff\nVs\n1 - D\nwhere D = ton/(ton + toff) is the duty cycle. Since 0 ≤ D ≤ 1, the output voltage is\nalways greater than or equal to the input voltage.\nThe actual circuit uses a chip called the TL5001 to actively control D in order to\nmaintain the desired output voltage.\nGeiger-Muller counter circuit theory\n\n4: Side note: measuring the high voltage\nFor energy to be conserved, the current to the load has to be smaller than the current\ndrawn from the battery. But, measuring devices such as multimeters and oscillo\nscopes have large (but finite) input impedances and can draw too much current, thus\ncausing the output voltage to drop. Therefore, to get an accurate measurement of the\nvoltage applied to the GM tube it is necessary to use a voltage divider:\nR1\nI\nVHV\nVout\nVHV\nVHV = I(R1 + R2) → I = R1 + R2\nR2\nR2\nVout = IR2 =\nVHV\nI\nR1 + R2\nAs long as the total resistance, R1 + R2, is sufficient to not load down the boost\nconverter, an arbitrary division can be obtained. But, the meter itself has a resistance\nRM, so the circuit actually looks like this:\nR1\nI\nVHV\nVout\nR2\nRM\nThe analysis proceeds as before, but R2 and RM must first be replaced with their\nequivalent resistance, Req = R2RM/(R2 + RM). Multimeters typically have an input\nresistance of 10 MΩ, while oscilloscopes typically are only 1 MΩ. Therefore, the GM\ncounter includes a jumper to select which measuring device you are using.\n5: Inverter\nThe GM tube emits a current pulse, but the subsequent circuits require a voltage\npulse. This conversion is accomplished simply by putting the current from the GM\ntube through a 5.1 kΩ resistor. But, as will be discussed in the next section, the\npulse stretcher actually needs the inverse of this pulse - a signal that sits at Vs = 5 V\nwhen nothing is happening, then temporarily drops to 0 V when a pulse happens.\nThis conversion is accomplished using a transistor. In more advanced settings you\ncan use a transistor as an amplifier, but we will simply be using it as a switch. The\ntransistor has three leads: the emitter (e), collector (c) and base (b):\nc\nb\ne\nWhen Vb > Ve, current can flow from c to e. But, when Vb < Ve no current can\nflow.\nGeiger-Muller counter circuit theory\n\nTherefore, an inverter can be constructed like this:\nVs\nVout\nVin\nWhen Vin is high, current can flow through the transistor and Vout is pulled low.\nWhen Vin is low, current cannot flow and Vout is pulled to Vs.\n6: Pulse stretcher\nThe output from the GM tube (and hence the inverter) is very brief - if it were\nused to drive the piezo speaker and blue LED directly, the effect would be nearly\nimperceptible. The pulse stretcher uses a very useful component known as a 555\ntimer to turn a short input pulse (of arbitrary shape and duration) into a square pulse\n1.5 ms long.\nThe 555 timer is a circuit building block that brings together several related func\ntions in one convenient device. For those familiar with comparators and flip-flops, a\nsimplified internal schematic is given in Figure 2a. Refer to Figure 2b and Table 1\nfor the locations and functions of each pin. Refer to Franco [1], Horowitz and Hill\n[2], and manufacturer data sheets such as [3] for more details on this.\nThe pulse stretcher is formally known as a monostable multivibrator, the imple\nmentation is shown in Figure 3. Because of the structure of the timer, the pulse input\nto TRIG must be falling - i.e., the signal starts out above 1/3 VCC, then drops below\nthat level to trigger a pulse. This is why the inverter is necessary. To understand how\nthe circuit works, first consider the state before the pulse arrives:\n- There is no current from the tube, so the inverter puts Vs at TRIG.\n- The timer has not yet been triggered, so OUT is at 0 V.\n- DISCH is conducting, and hence the capacitor C is drained of all charge.\nOnce the pulse arrives:\n- The voltage at TRIG briefly drops below 1/3 VCC.\n- This causes OUT to be set to VCC.\n- This also causes DISCH to stop conducting.\n- Hence, the capacitor C starts to charge through resistor R.\n- After ton = 1.1RC, capacitor C is charged to the point that THRESH is above\n2/3 VCC.\n- This causes OUT to be set to 0 V and DISCH to become conducting, thus\nrapidly draining the capacitor and getting the circuit ready for the next pulse.\nSample voltage histories for a single triggering of this circuit are given in Figure 4.\nGeiger-Muller counter circuit theory\n\n-\n+\nC2\n-\n+\nflip-flop\nC1\nR\nR\nR\nCL\nQ\nQ\nR\nS\nRES\nVcc\nOUT\nDISCH\nGND\nTRIG\nCONTROL\nTHRESH\nGND\nTRIG\nOUT\nRES\nCONTROL\nTHRESH\nDISCH\nVcc\nFigure 2: (a) Simplified in\nternal schematic of the 555\ntimer.

When the\nflip-flop is off (OUT is low), the transistor is turned on (satu\nrated), thus allowing an external capacitor to be discharged\nto ground.\nPower supply.\nGeiger-Muller counter circuit theory\n\nVCC\nVCC\nR\nC\n10nF\nFigure 3: Monostable mul\ntivibrator (one-shot pulse\nstretcher) implemented with\na 555 timer.\nPin 4 (RES) is held to VCC in\norder to keep the flip-flop\nenabled.\nPin 5 (CONTROL) is con\nnected to ground through\na 10 nF capacitor in order to\nreduce the impact of noise in\nthe circuit on the threshold\nvoltage.\nvTRIG [V]\nMonostable Multivibrator, RC = 1ms, Vcc = 5V\nvOUT [V]\n-0.5\n0.5\n1.5\nt [ms]\nvC [V]\nFigure 4: Voltage histories\nfor the monostable circuit.\nThe top plot shows the volt\nage at pin 2 (TRIG). Notice\nthat the pulse does not need\nto drop all the way to zero,\nnor does it even need to\nhave a particularly \"square\"\nshape - as soon as vTRIG\ndrops below 1/3 VCC the\ncycle starts.\nThe middle plot shows the\nvoltage at pin 3 (OUT). The\npulse starts as soon as the\nvoltage at pin 2 (TRIG) drops\nbelow 1/3 VCC and continues\nfor a duration 1.1RC.\nThe bottom plot shows\nthe voltage across the ca\npacitor (and hence at pin\n6 (THRESH)). The pulse\nends and the capacitor is\nrapidly discharged through\npin 7 (DISCH) as soon as vC\nreaches 2/3 VCC.\nGeiger-Muller counter circuit theory\n\n7: Op-amps\nThe op-amp (short for \"operational amplifier\") is an exceedingly versatile component\n- it can be used to construct many types of filters and amplifiers, among other things.\nThe op-amp has three terminals of interest:\nV-\n-\n+\nVout\nV+\nThere are two simple rules that enable you to work out what many op-amp circuits\ndo:\n1. There is no current in or out of the \"+\" and \"-\" inputs.\n2. When negative feedback is present, the op-amp will adjust the voltage at the\noutput terminal to ensure that V+ = V-.\nConsider the non-inverting amplifier:\nR1\n-\n+\nR2\nVout\nVin\nFrom rule (2), we know that V-= V+ = Vin. From rule (1), we know that all of\nthe current goes from the output to ground, since it cannot go into the \"-\" input.\nNotice that R1 and R2 form a voltage divider, so\nR2\nR1\n=\nVin\nVout → Vout = (1 +\n) Vin\nR1 + R2\nR2\n8: The filter\nThe filter acts to smooth out the pulses from the GM tube in order to produce a\nvoltage roughly proportional to the count rate. It is of a very simple type:\nR1\n-\n+\nRfilter\nCfilter\nVin\nR2\nVout\nThis is simply the non-inverting amplifier from above with a filter composed of Rfilter\nand Cfilter added to shunt the high-frequency components off to ground.\nGeiger-Muller counter circuit theory\n\n9: The current pump\nThe brightness of the LEDs is determined by the current. But, the filter described\nabove puts out a voltage. A circuit that converts a voltage to a current is called a\ntransconductance amplifier. The GM counter uses a particular implementation\nknown as the Howland current pump:\nR4\nVin\n-\n+\nR3\nR1\nR2\nload\nIout\nAs long as\nR4\nR2\n=\n,\nR3\nR1\nthe current delivered to the load will be\nVin\n=\nIout\nR1\n10: The difference amplifier\nThe filter and one current pump are sufficient to drive a current through the red LED\nwhich is (roughly) proportional to the count rate. But, to have the desired effect the\ngreen LED must fade out as the count rate increases. A difference amplifier is used\nto subtract the filter voltage from a reference voltage:\nR2\nV1\nR1\n-\n+\nVout\nV2\nR3\nR4\nGeiger-Muller counter circuit theory\n\nIf R3 = R1 and R4 = R2, then the output voltage will be\nR2\nVout =\n(V2 - V1)\nR1\nReferences\n[1] S.
