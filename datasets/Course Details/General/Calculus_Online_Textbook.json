      "content": "CHAPTER 0\nHighlights of Calculus\n0.1 Distance and Speed == Height and Slope\nCalculus is about functions. I use that word \"functions\" in the first sentence,\nbecause we can't go forward without it. Like all other words, we learn this one in\ntwo different ways: We define the word and we use the word.\nI believe that seeing examples of functions, and using the word to explain those\nexamples, is a fast and powerful way to learn. I will start with three examples:\nLinear function\ny.x/ D 2x\nSquaring function\ny.x/ D x2\nExponential function\ny.x/ D 2x\nThe first point is that those are not the same! Their formulas involve 2 and x in very\ndifferent ways. When I draw their graphs (this is a good way to understand functions)\nyou see that all three are increasing when x is positive. The slopes are positive.\nWhen the input x increases (moving to the right), the output y also increases\n(the graph goes upward). The three functions increase at different rates.\ny D 2x\nLine\nx\ny\ny D x2\nParabola\nx\ny\ny D 32\ny D 2x\nExponential\nx\ny\ny D 23\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nNear the start at x D 0, the first function increases the fastest. But the others soon\ncatch up. All three graphs reach the same height y D 4 when x D 2: Beyond that\npoint the second graph y D x2 pulls ahead. At x D 3 the squaring function reaches\ny D 32 D 9, while the height of the third graph is only y D 23 D 8:\nDon't be deceived, the exponential will win. It pulls even at x D 4, because 42 and\n24 are both 16. Then y D 2x moves ahead of y D x2 and it stays ahead. When you\nreach x D 10, the third graph will have y D 210 D 1024 compared to y D 102 D 100:\nThe graphs themselves are a straight line and a parabola and an exponential.\nThe straight line has constant growth rate. The parabola has increasing growth rate.\nThe exponential curve has exponentially increasing growth rate. I emphasize these\nbecause calculus is all about growth rates.\nThe whole point of differential calculus is to discover the growth rate of a function,\nand to use that information. So there are actually two functions in play at the\nsame time--the original function and its growth rate. Before I go further down\nthis all-important road, let me give a working definition of a function y.x/:\nA function has inputs x and outputs y.x/. To each x it assigns one y.\nThe inputs x come from the \"domain\" of the function. In our graphs the domain\ncontained all numbers x\n¥ 0. The outputs y form the \"range\" of the function. The\nranges for the first two functions y D 2x and y D x2 contained all numbers y\n¥ 0.\nBut the range for y D 2x is limited to y\n¥ 1 when the domain is x\n¥ 0.\nSince these examples are so important, let me also allow x to be negative.\nThe three graphs are shown below. Strictly speaking, these are new functions! Their\ndomains have been extended to all real numbers x. Notice that the three ranges are\nalso different:\nThe range of y D 2x is all real numbers y\nThe range of y D x2 is all nonnegative numbers y\n¥ 0\nThe range of y D 2x is all positive numbers y\n¡ 0\ny D 2x\nx\ny\ny D x2\nx\ny\ny D 2x\nx\ny\nOne more note about the idea of a function, and then calculus can begin. We have\nseen the three most popular ways to describe a function:\n1. Give a formula to find y from x. Example: y.x/ D 2x:\n2. Give a graph that shows x (distance across) and y (distance up).\n3. Give the input-output pairs (x in the domain and y in the range).\n\n0.1\nDistance and Speed == Height and Slope\nIn a high-level definition, the \"function\" is the set of all the input-output pairs. We\ncould also say: The function is the rule that assigns an output y in the range to every\ninput x in the domain.\nThis shows something that we see for other words too. Logically, the definition\nshould come first. Practically, we understand the definition better after we know\nexamples that use the word. Probably that is the way we learn other words and also\nthe way we will learn calculus. Examples show the general idea, and the definition\nis more precise. Together, we get it right.\nThe first words in this book were Calculus is about functions. Now I have to\nupdate that.\nPAIRS OF FUNCTIONS\nCalculus is about pairs of functions. Call them Function (1) and Function (2).\nOur graphs of y D 2x and y D x2 and y D 2x were intended to be examples of\nFunction (1). Then we discussed the growth rates of those three examples. The\ngrowth rate of Function (1) is Function (2). This is our first task--to find the\ngrowth rate of a function. Differential calculus starts with a formula for\nFunction .1/ and aims to produce a formula for Function .2/:\nLet me say right away how calculus operates. There are two ways to compute how\nquickly y changes when x changes:\nMethod 1(Limits): Write Change in y\nChange in x D y\nx . Take the limit of this ratio as x\nN 0.\nMethod 2 (Rules): Follow a rule to produce new growth rates from known rates.\nFor each new function y.x/, look to see if it can be produced from known\nfunctions--obeying one of the rules. An important part of learning calculus is\nto see different ways of producing new functions from old. Then we follow the\nrules for the growth rate.\nSuppose the new function is not produced from known functions (2x is not\nproduced from 2x or x2). Then we have to find its growth rate directly. By\n\"directly\" I mean that we compute a limit which is Function (2). This book will\nexplain what a \"limit\" means and how to compute it.\nHere we begin with examples--almost always the best way. I will state the\ngrowth rates \"dy=dx\" for the three functions we are working with:\nFunction (1)\ny D 2x\ny D x2\ny D 2x\nFunction (2)\ndy\ndx D 2\ndy\ndx D 2x\ndy\ndx D 2x.ln 2/\nThe linear function y D 2x has constant growth rate dy=dx D 2. This section will\ntake that first and easiest step. It is our opportunity to connect the growth rate to the\nslope of the graph. The ratio of up to across is 2x=x which is 2.\nSection 0:2 takes the next step. The squaring function y D x2 has linear growth rate\ndy=dx D 2x. (This requires the idea of a limit--so fundamental to calculus.) Then we\ncan introduce our first two rules:\nConstant factor\nThe growth rate of Cy.x/ is C times the growth rate of y.x/.\nSum of functions\nThe growth rate of y1 Cy2 is the sum of the two growth rates.\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nThe first rule says that y D 5x2 has growth rate 10x. The factor C D 5 multiplies\nthe growth rate 2x. The second rule says that y1 Cy2 D 5x2 C2x has growth rate\n10x C2. Notice how we immediately took 5x2 as a function y1 with a known growth\nrate. Together, the two rules give the growth rate for any \"linear combination\" of\ny1 and y2:\nThe growth rate of C1y1 CC2y2 is that same combination C1\ndy1\ndx CC2\ndy2\ndx .\nIn words, the step from Function (1) to Function (2) is linear. The slope of y D x2\nx\nis dy=dx D 2x\n1. This rule is simple but so important.\nFinally, Section 0:3 will present the exponential functions y D 2x and y D ex.\nOur first job is their meaning--what is \"2 to the power \" ? We understand\n23 D 8 and 24 D 16, but how can we multiply 2 by itself times?\nWhen we meet ex, we are seeing the great creation of calculus. This is a function\nwith the remarkable property that dy=dx D y. The slope equals the function. This\nrequires the amazing number e, which was never seen in algebra--because it only\nappears when you take the right limit.\nSo these first sections compute growth rates for three essential functions. We are\nready for y D 2x.\nTHE SLOPE OF A GRAPH\nThe slope is distance up divided by distance across. I am thinking now about the\ngraph of a function y.x/. The \"distance across\" is the change x2\nx1 in the inputs,\nfrom x1 to x2. The \"distance up\" is the change y2\ny1 in the outputs, from y1 to y2.\nThe slope is large and the graph is steep when y2\ny1 is much larger than x2\nx1.\nChange in y divided by change in x matches our ordinary meaning of the word slope:\nAverage slope D change in y\nchange in x D y2\ny1\nx2\nx1\nD y\nx :\n(1)\nI introduced the very useful Greek letter (delta), as a symbol for change. We take\na step of length x to go from x1 to x2. For the height y.x/ on the graph, that\nproduces a step y D y2\ny1. The ratio of y to x, up divided by across, is the\naverage slope between x1 and x2. The slope is the steepness.\nImportant point: I had to say \"average\" because the slope could be changing as\nwe go. The graph of y D x2 shows an increasing slope. Between x1 D 1 and x2 D 2,\nwhat is the average slope for y D x2 ? Divide y by x:\ny1 D 1 at x1 D 1\ny2 D 4 at x2 D 2\nAverage slope D 4\n1 D y\nx D 3:\nBetween x1 D 0 and x2 D 2, we get a different answer (not 3). This graph of x2\nshows the problem of calculus, to deal with changes in slope and changes in speed.\nThe graph of y D 2x has constant slope. The ratio of y to x, distance up to\ndistance across, is always 2:\nConstant slope\ny\nx D y2\ny1\nx2\nx1\nD 2x2\n2x1\nx2\nx1\nD 2:\nThe mathematics is easy, which gives me a chance to emphasize the words and the\nideas:\nFunction (1) D Height of the graph\nFunction (2) D Slope of the graph\n\n0.1\nDistance and Speed == Height and Slope\nx\ny\ny\nx D 2\n1 or 4\nConstant slope\nx\ny D x2\ny\ny\nx D 3\n1 or 4\nChanging slope\nWhen Function (1) is y D Cx, the ratio y=x is always C. A linear function has\na constant slope. And those same functions can come from driving a car at constant\nspeed:\nFunction (1) D Distance traveled D Ct\nFunction (2) D Speed of the car D C\nFor a graph of Function (1), its rate of change is the slope. When Function (1)\nmeasures distance traveled, its rate of change is the speed (or velocity). When\nFunction .1/ measures our height, its rate of change is our growth rate.\nThe first point is that functions are everywhere. For calculus, those functions\ncome in pairs. Function .2/ is the rate of change of Function .1/:\nThe second point is that Function (1) and Function (2) are measured in different\nunits. That is natural:\n\nSpeed in miles\nhour\n\nmultiplies\n\nTime in hours\n\nto give\n\nDistance in miles\n\nGrowth rate in inches\nyear\n\nmultiplies\n\nTime in years\n\nto give\n\nHeight in inches\n\nWhen time is in seconds and distance is in meters, then speed is automatically in\nmeters per second. We can choose two units, and they decide the third. Function (2)\nalways involves a division: y is divided by x or distance is divided by time.\nThe delicate and tricky part of calculus is coming next. We want the slope at one\npoint and the speed at one instant. What is the rate of change in zero time ?\nThe distance across is x D 0 at a point. The distance up is y D 0. Formally,\ntheir ratio is\n0. It is the inspiration of calculus to give this a useful meaning.\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nBig Picture\nCalculus connects Function (1) with Function (2) D rate of change of (1)\nFunction (1)\nDistance traveled f .t/\nFunction (2)\nSpeed s.t/ D df=dt\nFunction (1)\nHeight of graph y.x/\nFunction (2)\nSlope s.x/ D dy=dx\nFunction (2) tells how quickly Function (1) is changing\nKEY Constant speed s D Distance f\nTime t\nConstant slope s D\nDistance up\nDistance across\nGraphs of (1) and (2)\nf D increasing distance\ns D constant speed\nf\nf D st\nt\ns\nt\nSlope of f-graph D\nup\nacross D st\nt D s\nArea under s-graph D area of rectangle D st D f\nNow run the car backwards.\nSpeed is negative\nDistance goes down to 0\nArea \"under\" s.t/ is zero\nf .t/\nt\nt\nCs\ns\ns.t/\nThis area\nis negative\n\n0.1\nDistance and Speed == Height and Slope\nExample with increasing speed\nThen distance has steeper slope\nf D 10t2\ns D 20t\nf\nt\ns\nt\nWhen speed is changing, algebra is not enough\ns D f\nt is wrong\nStill true that area under s D triangle area D 1\n2.t/.20t/ D 10t2 D f\nStill true that s D slope of f D df\ndt D \"derivative\" of f\nWhen f is increasing, the slope s is positive\nWhen f is decreasing, the slope s is negative\nWhen f is at its maximum or minimum, the slope s is zero\nThe graphs of any f .t/ and f .t/C10 have the same slope at every t\nTo recover f D Function (1) from df\ndt ; good to know a starting height f .0/\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nPractice Questions\n1.

(Measure distance from the train station)\n\n0.2\nThe Changing Slope of y D x2 and y D xn\n0.2 The Changing Slope of y D x2 and y D xn\nThe second of our three examples is y D x2: Now the slope is changing as we move\nup the curve. The average slope is still y=x; but that is not our final goal. We have\nto answer the crucial questions of differential calculus:\nWhat is the meaning of \"slope at a point\" and how can we compute it ?\nMy video lecture on Big Picture: Derivatives also faces those questions. Every\nstudent of calculus soon reaches this same problem. What is the meaning of \"rate\nof change\" when we are at a single moment in time, and nothing actually changes\nin that moment? Good question.\nThe answers will come in two steps. Algebra produces y=x; and then calculus\nfinds dy=dx: Those steps dy and dx are infinitesimally short, so formally we are\nlooking at 0=0: Trying to define dy and dx and 0=0 is not wise, and I won't do it.\nThe successful plan is to realize that the ratio of y to x is clearly defined, and\nthose two numbers can become very small. If that ratio y=x approaches a limit,\nwe have a perfect answer:\nThe slope at x is the limit of\ny\nx D y.x Cx/\ny.x/\nx\n:\nThe distance across, from x to x Cx; is just x: The distance up is from y.x/ to\ny.x Cx/: Let me show how algebra leads directly to y=x when y D x2:\ny\nx D .x Cx/2\nx2\nx\nD x2 C2xx C.x/2\nx2\nx\nD 2x Cx:\nNotice that calculation! The \"leading terms\" x2 and\nx2 cancel. The important term\nhere is 2xx: This \"first-order term\" is responsible for most of y: The \"second-\norder term\" in this example is .x/2: After we divide by x; this term is still small.\nThat part .x/2=x will disappear as the step size x goes to zero.\nThat limiting process x\nN 0 produces the slope dy=dx at a point. The first-\norder term survives in dy=dx and higher-order terms disappear.\nSlope at a point\ndy\ndx D limit of y\nx D limit of 2x Cx D 2x:\nAlgebra produced y=x: In the limit, calculus gave us dy=dx: Look at the\ngraph, to see the geometry of those steps. The ratio up=across D y=x is the slope\nbetween two points on the graph. The two points come together in the limit.\nThen y=x approaches the slope dy=dx at a single point.\n\nHighlights of Calculus\ny D x2\nx\nx Cx\ny\nx D 2x Cx\ny D x2\nx x Cx\nx\ny\ny D x2\nx\nx Cdx\ndy\ndx D 2x\nThe color lines connecting points on the first two graphs are called \"chords.\"\nThey approach the color line on the third graph, which touches at only one point.\nThis is the \"tangent line\" to the curve. Here is the idea of differential calculus:\nSlope of tangent line D Slope of curve D Function .2/ D dy\ndx D 2x:\nTo find the equation for this tangent line, return to algebra. Choose any specific\nvalue x0: Above that position on the x axis, the graph is at height y0 D x2\n0:\nThe slope of the tangent line at that point of the graph is dy=dx D 2x0:\nWe want the equation for the line through that point with that slope.\nEquation for the tangent line\ny\ny0 D .2x0/.x\nx0/\n(1)\nAt the point where x D x0 and y D y0; this equation becomes 0 D 0: The equation is\nsatisfied and the point is on the line. Furthermore the slope of the line matches the\nslope 2x0 of the curve. You see that directly if you divide both sides by x\nx0:\nTangent line\nup\nacross D y\ny0\nx\nx0\nD 2x0 is the correct slope dy\ndx :\nLet me say this again. The curve y D x2 is bending, the tangent line is straight.\nThis line stays as close to the curve as possible, near the point where they touch.\nThe tangent line gives a linear approximation to the nonlinear function y D x2:\nLinear approximation\ny\ny0 C.2x0/.x\nx0/ D y0 C dy\ndx .x\nx0/\n(2)\nI only moved y0 to the right side of equation (1). Then I used the symbol\nfor\n\"approximately equal\" because the symbol D would be wrong: The curve bends.\nImportant for the future: This bending comes from the second derivative of y D x2:\n\n0.2\nThe Changing Slope of y D x2 and y D xn\nTHE SECOND DERIVATIVE\nThe first derivative is the slope dy=dx D 2x: The second derivative is the slope\nof the slope. By good luck we found the slope of 2x in the previous section (easy to\ndo, it is just the constant 2). Notice the symbol d 2y=dx2 for the slope of the slope:\nSecond derivative d2y\ndx2\nThe slope of dy\ndx D 2x is d 2y\ndx2 D 2:\n(3)\nIn ordinary language, the first derivative dy=dx tells how fast the function y.x/ is\nchanging. The second derivative tells whether we are speeding up or slowing down.\nThe example y D x2 is certainly speeding up, since the graph is getting steeper. The\ncurve is bending and the tangent line is steepening.\nThink also about y D x2 on the left side (the negative side) of x D 0: The graph\nis coming down to zero. Its slope is certainly negative. But the curve is still bending\nupwards! The algebra agrees with this picture: The slope dy=dx D 2x is negative on\nthe left side of x D 0; but the second derivative d 2y=dx2 D 2 is still positive.\nAn economist or an investor watches all three of those numbers: y.x/ tells where\nthe economy is, and dy=dx tells which way it is going (short term, close to the\ntangent line). But it is d 2y=dx2 that reveals the longer term prediction. I am\nwriting these words near the end of the economic downturn (I hope). I am sorry that\ndy=dx has been negative but happy that d 2y=dx2 has recently been positive.\nDISTANCE AND SPEED AND ACCELERATION\nAn excellent example of y.x/ and dy=dx and d 2y=dx2 comes from driving a car.\nThe function y is the distance traveled. Its rate of change (first derivative) is the speed.\nThe rate of change of the speed (second derivative) is the acceleration. If you are\npressing on the gas pedal, all three will be positive. If you are pressing on the brake,\nthe distance and speed are probably still positive but the acceleration is negative:\nThe speed is dropping. If the car is in reverse and you are braking, what then ?\nThe speed is negative (going backwards)\nThe speed is increasing (less negative)\nThe acceleration is positive (increasing speed).\nThe video lecture mentions that car makers don't know calculus. The distance\nmeter on the dashboard does not go back toward zero (in reverse gear it should).\nThe speedometer does not go below zero (it should). There is no meter at all (on my\ncar) for acceleration. Spaceships do have accelerometers, and probably aircraft too.\nWe often hear that an astronaut or a test pilot is subjected to a high number of g's.\nThe ordinary acceleration in free fall is one g; from the gravity of the Earth. An\nairplane in a dive and a rocket at takeoff will have a high second derivative--the\nrocket may be hardly moving but it is accelerating like mad.\nOne more very useful point about this example of motion. The natural letter to use\nis not x but t. The distance is a function of time. The slope of a graph is up=across,\nbut now the right ratio is (change of distance) divided by (change in time):\nAverage speed between t and t Ct\ny\nt D y.t Ct/\ny.t/\nt\nSpeed at t itself (instant speed)\ndy\ndt D limit of y\nt as t\nN 0\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nThe words \"rate of change\" and \"rate of growth\" suggest t. The word \"slope\"\nsuggests x: But calculus doesn't worry much about the letters we use. If we graph\nthe distance traveled as a function of time, then the x axis (across) becomes the\nt axis. And the slope of that graph becomes the speed (velocity is the best word).\nHere is something not often seen in calculus books--the second difference.\nWe know the first difference y D y.t Ct/\ny.t/. It is the change in y: The\nsecond difference 2y is the change in y:\nSecond\ndifference\n2y D .y.t Ct/\ny.t//\n.y.t/\ny.t\nt//\n2y\n.t/2\nN d2y\ndt2\n(4)\n2y\nsimplifies\nto\ny.t Ct/\n2y.t/Cy.t\nt/:\nWe\ndivide\nby\n.t/2\nto\napproximate the acceleration. In the limit as t\nN 0, this ratio 2y=.t/2\nbecomes the second derivative d2y=dt2.\nTHE SLOPE OF y D xn\nThe slope of y D x2 is dy=dx D 2x: Now I want to compute the slopes of y D x3\nand y D x4 and all succeeding powers y D xn: The rate of increase of xn will be\nfound again in Section 2:2: But there are two reasons to discover these special\nderivatives early:\n1. Their pattern is simple: The slope of each power y D xn is dy\ndx D nxn 1:\n2. The next section can then introduce y D ex: This amazing function has dy\ndx D y:\nOf course y D x2 fits into this pattern for xn: The exponent drops by 1 from n D 2\nto n\n1 D 1. Also n D 2 multiplies that lower power to give nxn 1 D 2x:\nThe slope of y D x3 is dy=dx D 3x2. Watch how 3x2 appears in y=x:\ny\nx D .x Cx/3\nx3\nx\nD x3 C3x2 x C3x.x/2 C.x/3\nx3\nx\n:\n(5)\nCancel x3 with\nx3: Then divide by x:\nAverage slope\ny\nx D 3x2 C3xx C.x/2:\nWhen the step length x goes to zero, the limit value dy=dx is 3x2: This is nxn 1.\nTo establish this pattern for n D 4;5;6; ::: the only hard part is .x Cx/n: When\nn was 3; we multiplied this out in equation (5) above. The result will always start\nwith xn: We claim that the next term (the \"first-order term\" in y) will be nxn 1x:\nWhen we divide this part of y by x; we have the answer we want--the correct\nderivative nxn 1 of y.x/ D xn:\nHow to see that term nxn 1x ? Our multiplications showed that 2xx and\n3x2x are correct for n D 2 and 3. Then we can reach n D 4 from n D 3:\n.x Cx/4 D .x Cx/3 times .x Cx/\nD .x3 C3x2x C\n\n/ times .x Cx/\nThat multiplication produces x4 and 4x3x, exactly what we want. We can go from\neach n to the next one in the same way (this is called \"induction\"). The derivatives of\nall the powers x4, x5; :::, xn are 4x3, 5x4; :::, nxn 1.\n\n0.2\nThe Changing Slope of y D x2 and y D xn\nSection 2:2 of the book shows you a slightly different proof of this formula.\nAnd the video lecture on the Product Rule explains one more way. Look at xnC1\nas the product of xn times x, and use the rule for the slope of y1 times y2:\nProduct Rule\nSlope of y1y2 D y2 (slope of y1) C y1 (slope of y2)\n(6)\nWith y1 D xn and y2 D x, the slope of y1y2 D xnC1 comes out right:\nx.slope of xn/Cxn.slope of x/ D x.nxn 1/Cxn.1/ D .nC1/xn:\n(7)\nAgain we can increase n one step at a time. Soon comes the truly valuable fact that\nthis derivative formula is correct for all powers y D xn. The exponent n can be\nnegative, or a fraction, or any number at all. The slope dy=dx is always nxn 1.\nBy combining different powers of x, you know the slope of every \"polynomial.\"\nAn example is y D x Cx2=2Cx3=3. Compute dy=dx one term at a time, as the\nSum Rule allows:\nd\ndx\n\nx C x2\n2 C x3\n\nD 1Cx Cx2:\nThe slope of the slope is d 2y=dx2 D 1C2x.

It uses the derivative of\nxn; the first thing we learn.\nIn all approaches, a \"limiting step\" will be involved. So the amazing number\ne D 2:7::: is not seen in algebra (e is not a fraction). The question is where to\ntake that limiting step, and my answer starts with this truly remarkable fact:\nWhen y D ex is Function .1/, it is also Function .2/.\nThe exponential function y D ex solves the equation dy\ndx D y:\nThe function equals its slope. This is a first example of a differential equation--\nconnecting an unknown function y with its own derivatives. Fortunately dy=dx D y\nis the most important differential equation--a model that other equations try to follow.\nI will add one more requirement, to eliminate solutions like y D 2ex and y D 8ex:\nWhen y D ex solves our equation, all other functions Cex solve it too. (C D 2\nand C D 8 will appear on both sides of dy=dx D y, and they cancel.) At x D 0,\ne0 will be the \"zeroth power\" of the positive number e: All zeroth powers are 1.\nSo we want y D ex to equal 1 when x D 0:\ny D ex is the solution of dy\ndx D y that starts from y D 1 at x D 0.\nBefore solving dy=dx D y, look at what this equation means. When y starts\nfrom 1 at x D 0, its slope is also 1. So y increases. Therefore dy=dx also increases,\nstaying equal to y: So y increases faster. The graph gets steeper as the function\nclimbs higher. This is what \"growing exponentially\" means.\nINTRODUCING ex\nExponential growth is quite ordinary and reasonable. When a bank pays interest on\nyour money, the interest is proportional to the amount you have. After the interest is\nadded, you have more. The new interest is based on the higher amount. Your wealth\nis growing \"geometrically,\" one step at a time.\nAt the end of this section on ex; I will come back to continuous compounding--\ninterest is added at every instant instead of every year. That word \"continuous\"\nsignals that we need calculus. There is a limiting step, from every year or month\nor day or second to every instant. You don't get infinite interest, you do get\nexponentially increasing interest.\nI will also describe other ways to introduce ex: This is an important question with\nmany answers! I like equation (1) below, because we know the derivative of each\npower xn. If you take their derivatives in equation (1), you get back the same ex:\namazing. So that sum solves dy=dx D y; starting from y D 1 as we wanted.\nThe difficulty is that the sum involves every power xn: an infinite series. When\nI go step by step, you will see that those powers are all needed. For this infinite\nseries, I am asking you to believe that everything works. We can add the series\nto get ex; and we can add all derivatives to see that the slope of ex is ex:\nFor me, the advantage of using only the powers xn is overwhelming.\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nCONSTRUCTING y D ex\nI will solve dy=dx D y a step at a time. At the start, y D 1 means that dy=dx D 1:\nStart\ny D 1\ndy=dx D 1\nChange y\ny D 1Cx\ndy=dxD 1\nChange dy\ndx\ny D 1Cx\ndy=dx D 1Cx\nAfter the first change, y D 1Cx has the correct derivative dy=dx D 1: But then I\nhad to change dy=dx to keep it equal to y: And I can't stop there:\ny D 1Cx\ndy=dxD 1Cx\nUpdate y to 1Cx C 1\n2x2\nThen update dy\ndx to 1Cx C 1\n2x2\nThe extra 1\n2x2 gave the correct x in the slope. Then 1\n2x2 also had to go into dy=dx,\nto keep it equal to y: Now we need a new term with this derivative 1\n2x2:\nThe term that gives 1\n2x2 has x3 divided by 6: The derivative of xn is nxn 1, so I\nmust divide by n (to cancel correctly). Then the derivative of x3=6 is 3x2=6 D 1\n2x2\nas we wanted. After that comes x4 divided by 24:\nx3\n6 D\nx3\n.3/.2/.1/\nhas slope\nx2\n.2/.1/\nx4\n24 D\nx4\n.4/.3/.2/.1/\nhas slope\n4x3\n.4/.3/.2/.1/ D x3\n6 :\nThe pattern becomes more clear. The xn term is divided by n factorial, which is nS D\n.n/.n\n1/:::.1/: The first five factorials are 1;2;6;24;120: The derivative\nof that term xn=nS is the previous term xn 1=.n\n1/S (because the n's cancel).\nAs long as we don't stop, this sum of infinitely many terms does achieve dy=dx D y:\ny.x/ D ex D 1Cx C 1\n2x2 C 1\n6x3 C\n\nC 1\nnSxnC\n\n(1)\nIf we substitute x D 10 into this series, do the infinitely many terms add to a finite\nnumber e10 ? Yes. The numbers nS grow much faster than 10n (or any other xn).\nSo the terms xn=nS in this \"exponential series\" become extremely small as n\nN\n8:\nAnalysis shows that the sum of the series (which is y D ex) does achieve dy=dx D y:\nNote 1\nLet me just remember a series that you know, 1C 1\n2 C 1\n4 C 1\n8 C\n\nD 2:\nIf I replace 1\n2 by x, this becomes the geometric series 1Cx Cx2 Cx3 C\n\nand\nit adds up to 1=.1\nx/: This is the most important series in mathematics, but it\nruns into a problem at x D 1: the infinite sum 1C1C1C1C\n\ndoesn't \"converge.\"\nI emphasize that the series for ex is always safe, because the powers xn\nare divided by the rapidly growing numbers nS D n factorial. This is a great\nexample to meet, long before you learn more about convergence and divergence.\nNote 2\nHere is another way to look at that series for ex: Start with xn and take\nits derivative n times. First get nxn 1 and then n.n\n1/xn 2. Finally the nth\nderivative is n.n\n1/.n\n2/:::.1/x0; which is n factorial. When we divide by that\nnumber, the nth derivative of xn=nS is equal to 1:\nNow look at ex: All its derivatives are still ex: They all equal 1 at x D 0:\nThe series is matching every derivative of the function ex at the starting point x D 0:\n\n0.3\nThe Exponential y D ex\nSet x D 1 in the exponential series. This tells us the amazing number e1 D e:\nThe number e\ne D 1C1C 1\n2 C 1\n6 C 1\n24 C\n120 C\n\n(2)\nThe first three terms add to 2.5. The first five terms almost reach 2.71. We never reach\n2.72. With quite a few terms (how many? ) you can pass 2.71828. It is certain that e\nis not a fraction. It never appears in algebra, but it is the key number for calculus.\nMULTIPLYING BY ADDING EXPONENTS\nWe write e2 in the same way that we write 32: Is it true that e times e equals e2 ?\nUp to now, e and e2 come from setting x D 1 and x D 2 in the infinite series.\nThe wonderful fact is that for every x, the series produces the \"xth power of the\nnumber e:\" When x D\n1, we get e\n1 which is 1=e:\nSet x D\ne\n1 D 1\ne D 1\n1C 1\n6 C 1\n120 C\n\nIf we multiply that series for 1=e by the series for e, we get 1:\nThe best way is to go straight for all multiplications of ex times any power eX: The\nrule of adding exponents says that the answer is exCX: The series must say this too!\nWhen x D 1 and X D\n1, this rule produces e0 from e1 times e\n1:\nAdd the exponents\n.ex/.eX/ D exCX\n(3)\nWe only know ex and eX from the infinite series. For this all-important rule, we can\nmultiply those series and recognize the answer as the series for exCX: Make a start:\nMultiply each term\nex times eX\nHoping for\nexCX\nex D 1 C x C 1\n2x2 C 1\n6x3 C\n\neX D 1 C XC 1\n2X2 C 1\n6X3 C\n\n.ex/.eX/ D 1 C x C X\nC 1\n2x2 C xX C 1\n2X2 C\n\n(4)\nCertainly you see x CX: Do you see 1\n2.x CX/2 in equation .4/ ? No problem:\n2.x CX/2 D 1\n2.x2 C2xX CX2/\nmatches the \"second degree\" terms.\nThe step to third degree takes a little longer, but it also succeeds:\n6.x CX/3 D 1\n6x3 C 3\n6x2X C 3\n6xX2 C 1\n6X3\nmatches the next terms in (4).\nFor high powers of x CX we need the binomial theorem (or a healthy trust that\nmathematics comes out right). When ex multiplies eX, the coefficient of xnXm\nwill be 1=nS times 1=mS: Now look for that same term in the series for exCX:\n.x CX/nCm\n.nCm/S\nincludes\nxnXm\n.nCm/S times .nCm/S\nnSmS\nwhich gives xnXm\nnSmS :\n(5)\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nThat binomial number .nCm/S=nS mS is known to successful gamblers. It counts the\nnumber of ways to choose n aces out of nCm aces. Out of 4 aces, you could choose\n2 aces in 4S=2S2S D 6 ways. To a mathematician, there are 6 ways to choose 2 x's\nout of xxxx. This number 6 will be the coefficient of x2X2 in .x CX/4:\nThat 6 shows up in the fourth degree term. It is divided by 4! (to produce 1=4).\nWhen ex multiplies eX, 1\n2x2 multiplies 1\n2X2 (which also produces 1=4). All terms\nare good, but we are not going there--we accept .ex/.eX/ D exCX as now confirmed.\nNote A different way to see this rule for .ex/.eX/ is based on dy=dx D y: Starting\nfrom y D 1 at x D 0, follow this equation. At the point x, you reach y D ex: Now go\nan additional distance X to arrive at exCX:\nNotice that the additional part starts from ex (instead of starting from 1). That\nstarting value ex will multiply eX in the additional part. So ex times eX must be the\nsame as exCX: (This is a \"differential equations proof\" that the exponents are added.\nPersonally, I was happy to multiply the series and match the terms.)\nThe rule immediately gives ex times ex: The answer is exCx D e2x: If we multiply\nagain by ex, we find .ex/3: This is equal to e2xCx D e3x: We are finding a new rule\nfor all powers .ex/n D .ex/.ex/\n\n.ex/:\nMultiply exponents\n.ex/n D enx\n(6)\nThis is easy to see for n D 1;2;3;::: and then n D\n1, 2, 3,...It remains true for\nall numbers x and n.\nThat last sentence about \"all numbers\" is important! Calculus cannot develop\nproperly without working with all exponents (not just whole numbers or fractions).\nThe infinite series (1) defines ex for every x and we are on our way. Here is the\ngraph: Function .1/ D Function .2/ D ex D exp.x/:\n-2\n-1\nln 2\nx\ne\n1 D :368:::\ne D 2:718:::\neln 2 D 2\ne2 D 7:388:::\ny D ex\ndy\ndx D ex\ne0 D 1\n.ex/.eX/ D exCX\n.ex/n D enx\nelny D y\n\n0.3\nThe Exponential y D ex\nTHE EXPONENTIALS 2x AND bx\nWe know that 23 D 8 and 24 D 16. But what is the meaning of 2 ? One way to get\nclose to that number is to replace by 3:14 which is 314=100: As long as we have a\nfraction in the exponent, we can live without calculus:\nFractional power\n2314=100 D 314th power of the 100th root 21=100:\nBut this is only \"close\" to 2: And in calculus, we will want the slope of the curve\ny D 2x: The good way is to connect 2x with ex; whose slope we know (it is ex again).\nSo we need to connect 2 with e:\nThe key number is the logarithm of 2. This is written \"ln 2\" and it is the power\nof e that produces 2: It is specially marked on the graph of ex:\nNatural logarithm of 2\neln 2 D 2\nThis number ln 2 is about 7=10. A calculator knows it with much higher accuracy.\nIn the graph of y D ex, the number ln 2 on the x axis produces y D 2 on the y axis.\nThis is an example where we want the output y D 2 and we ask for the input\nx D ln 2: That is the opposite of knowing x and asking for y. \"The logarithm\nx D ln y is the inverse of the exponential y D ex:\" This idea will be explained in\nSection 4:3 and in two video lectures--inverse functions are not always simple.\nNow 2x has a meaning for every x: When we have the number ln 2; meeting the\nrequirement 2 D eln 2; we can take the xth power of both sides:\nPowers of 2 from powers of e\n2 D eln 2\nand\n2x D ex ln 2:\n(7)\nAll powers of e are defined by the infinite series. The new function 2x also grows\nexponentially, but not as fast as ex (because 2 is smaller than e). Probably y D 2x\ncould have the same graph as ex, if I stretched out the x axis. That stretching\nmultiplies the slope by the constant factor ln 2: Here is the algebra:\nSlope of y D 2x\nd\ndx 2x D d\ndx ex ln 2 D .ln 2/ex ln 2 D .ln 2/2x:\nFor any positive number b, the same approach leads to the function y D bx.\nFirst, find the natural logarithm ln b. This is the number (positive or negative) so\nthat b D eln b. Then take the xth power of both sides:\nConnect b to e b D eln b\nand bx D ex ln b\nand\nd\ndx bx D .ln b/bx\n(8)\nWhen b is e (the perfect choice), lnb D lne D 1: When b is en, then lnb D lnen D n:\n\"The logarithm is the exponent.\" Thanks to the series that defines ex for every x,\nthat exponent can be any number at all.\nAllow me to mention Euler's Great Formula eix D cosx Ci sinx. The exponent\nix has become an imaginary number. (You know that i2 D\n1:) If we faithfully\nuse cos x Ci sin x at 90\nand 180\n(where x D =2 and x D ), we arrive at these\namazing facts:\nImaginary exponents\nei=2 D i\nand\nei D\n1:\n(9)\nThose equations are not imaginary, they come from the great series for ex:\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nCONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING OF INTEREST\nThere is a different and important way to reach e and ex (not by an infinite series).\nWe solve the key equation dy=dx D y in small steps. As these steps approach zero\n(a limit is always involved !) the small-step solution becomes the exact y D ex:\nI can explain this idea in two different languages. Each step multiplies by 1Cx:\n1. Compound interest. After each step x, the interest is added to y: Then the\nnext step begins with a larger amount, and y increases exponentially.\n2. Finite differences. The continuous dy=dx is replaced by small steps Y=x:\ndy\ndx D y changes to Y.x Cx/\nY.x/\nx\nD Y.x/ with Y.0/ D 1:\n(10)\nThis is Euler's method of approximation. Y.x/ approaches y.x/ as x\nN 0.\nLet me compute compound interest when 1 year is divided into 12 months, and\nthen 365 days. The interest rate is 100% and you start with Y.0/ D $1: If you only\nget interest once, at the end of the year, then you have Y.1/ D $2:\nIf interest is added every month, you now get\n12 of 100% each time (12 times).\nSo Y is multiplied each month by 1C 1\n12: (The bank adds\n12 for every 1 you have.)\nDo this 12 times and the final value $2 is improved to $2.61:\nAfter 12 months\nY.1/ D\n\n1C 1\nD $2.61\nNow add interest every day.

When we only have a rough graph of the\nfunction, we can't expect more than a rough graph of the slope. But graphs are very\nvaluable in applications of calculus!\nFrom a graph of y.x/, this section extracts the basic information about the growth\nrate (the slope) and the minimum=maximum and the bending (and area too). A\nbig part of that information is contained in a plus or minus sign. Is y.x/ increasing ?\nIs its slope increasing? Is the area under its graph increasing ? In each case some\nnumber is greater than zero. The three numbers are dy=dx and d 2y=dx2 and y.x/\nitself.\nWhen one of those numbers is exactly zero we always have a special situation. It is\na good thing that mathematics invented zero, we need it.\nThis section is organized by two themes:\n(1) Graphs that are drawn without a formula for y.x/. From that graph you can\ndraw other graphs--the slope dy=dx, the second derivative d 2y=dx2, the area\nA.x/ under the graph.\nYou can also identify where those functions are positive or negative--and\nespecially the points where dy=dx or d 2y=dx2 or y.x/ is zero.\n(2) Graphs that are drawn by a calculator or computer. Now there is a formula for\ny.x/. The display allows us to guess rules for derivatives:\nChain Rule\nInverse Rule\nl'Hopital's Rule\nThese rules come into later chapters of the book. They are also explained in\nHighlights of Calculus, the video lectures that are available to everyone. One\nspecific goal is to see how the derivative of 2x is proportional to 2x.\nThis section was much improved by ideas that were offered by Benjamin Goldstein.\nGRAPH WITHOUT FORMULAS\nx\ny.x/\n\nHighlights of Calculus\n1. Suppose this is the graph of some function y.x/\na. At what value(s) of x does y.x/ have a local minimum?\nb. At what value(s) of x does y.x/ have a local maximum?\nc.

Finally, change Y1 to Y1 D sin.3X/: What does Y2 appear to be this time ?\n4. Conjecture: If k is some constant, then the derivative of sin.kx/ is\n:\nb. Those functions are chains (also called compositions). They can be written in the\nform Y D f .g.x//: For sin.kx/ the outer function is f .x/ D\nand the inner\nfunction is g.x/ D\n:\nc. So far the inner function g.x/ has been linear, but it doesn't have to be. Let\nY D sin.\n?x/:\nConjecture: dY\ndx D\nwhen g.x/ D\n?x:\nCheck your conjecture by graphing Y and comparing to the graph of the numerical\nderivative.\nd. Now we generalize. Suppose g.x/ is any function. If y D sin.g.x//; then\ndy=dx D\n:\ne. There is nothing magical about the sine function. Whenever we have a composition\nof an outer and an inner function, the chain rule applies. Predict the following\nderivatives and check by graphing the numerical derivative on your calculator.\n1. y D .2x C4/3; dy=dx D\n3. y D cos.x2/; dy=dx D\n2. y D cos2 x D .cos x/2; dy=dx D\n4. y D Œsin.x2 C1/3; dy=dx D\nCOMPUTING IN CALCULUS\nSoftware is available for calculus courses--a lot of it. The packages keep getting\nbetter. Which program to use (if any) depends on cost and convenience and purpose.\nHow to use it is a much harder question. These pages identify some of the goals. Our\naim is to support, with examples, the effort to use computing to help learning.\nFor calculus, the greatest advantage of the computer is to offer graphics. You\nsee the function, not just the formula. As you watch, f .x/ reaches a maximum or\na minimum or zero. A separate graph shows its derivative. Those statements are not\n100% true, as everybody learns right away--as soon as a few functions are typed in.\nBut the power to see this subject is enormous, because it is adjustable. If we don't like\nthe picture we change to a new viewing window.\nThis is computer-based graphics. It combines numerical computation with graph-\nical computation. You get pictures as well as numbers--a powerful combination. The\ncomputer offers the experience of actually working with a function. The domain and\nrange are not just abstract ideas. You choose them. May I give a few examples.\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nEXAMPLE 1\nCertainlyx3equals 3x when xD3.Do those graphs ever meet again ?\nAt this point we don't know the full meaning of 3x, except when x is a nice number.\n(Neither does the computer.) Checking at xD2 and 4, the function x3 is smaller both\ntimes: 23 is below 32 and 43D64 is below 34D81. If x3 is always less than 3x we\nought to know--these are among the basic functions of mathematics.\nThe computer will answer numerically or graphically. At our command, it solves\nx3D3x. At another command, it plots both functions--this shows more. The screen\nproves a point of logic (or mathematics) that escaped us. If the graphs cross once, they\nmust cross again--because 3x is higher at 2 and 4. A crossing point near 2:5 is seen\nby zooming in. I am less interested in the exact number than its position--it comes\nbefore xD3 rather than after.\nA few conclusions from such a basic example:\n1. A supercomputer is not necessary.\n2. High-level programming is not necessary.\n3. We can do mathematics without completely understanding it.\nThe third point doesn't sound so good.Write it differently:We can learn mathematics\nwhile doing it. The hardest part of teaching calculus is to turn it from a spectator\nsport into a workout. The computer makes that possible.\nEXAMPLE 2\n(mental computer) Compare x2 with 2x. The functions meet at xD2.\nWhere do they meet again? Is it before or after 2 ?\nThat is mental computing because the answer happens to be a whole number (4). Now\nwe are on a different track. Does an accident like 24D42 ever happen again ? Can the\nmachine tell us about integers? Perhaps it can plot the solutions of xbDbx. I asked\nMathematica for a formula, hoping to discover x as a function of b--but the program\njust gave back the equation. For once the machine typed HELP instead of the user.\nWell, mathematics is not helpless. I am proud of calculus. There is a new exercise\nat the end of Section 6:4, to show that we never see whole numbers again.\nEXAMPLE 3\nFind the number b for which xb Dbx has only one solution (at xDb).\nWhen b is 3, the second solution is below 3. When b is 2, the second solution .4/ is\nabove 2. If we move b from 2 to 3, there must be a special \"double point\"--where\nthe graphs barely touch but don't cross. For that particular b--and only for that one\nvalue--the curve xb never goes above bx.\nThis special point b can be found with computer-based graphics. In many ways\nit is the \"center point of calculus.\" Since the curves touch but don't cross, they are\ntangent. They have the same slope at the double point. Calculus was created to work\nwith slopes, and we already know the slope of x2. Soon comes xb. Eventually we\ndiscover the slope of bx, and identify the most important number in calculus.\nThe point is that this number can be discovered first by experiment.\nEXAMPLE 4\nGraph y.x/ D ex\nxe. Locate its minimum. Zoom in near x D e:\nFrom the derivatives of ex and xe; show that dy=dx D 0 at x D e:\nIf you try, you can also find the next derivative d 2y=dx2: Can you see why\nd 2y=dx2\n¡ 0 at x D e ?\n\n0.5\nGraphs and Graphing Calculators\nThe next example was proposed by Don Small. Solve x4\n11x3 C5x\n2 D 0. The\nfirst tool is algebra--try to factor the polynomial. That succeeds for quadratics, and\nthen gets extremely hard. Even if the computer can do algebra better than we can,\nfactoring is seldom the way to go. In reality we have two good choices:\n1. (Mathematics) Use the derivative. Solve by Newton's method.\n2. (Graphics) Plot the function and zoom in.\nBoth will be done by the computer. Both have potential problems! Newton's method\nis fast, but that means it can fail fast. (It is usually terrific.) Plotting the graph is also\nfast--but solutions can be outside the viewing window. This particular function is zero\nonly once, in the standard window from\n10 to 10. The graph seems to be leaving\nzero, but mathematics again predicts a second crossing point. So we zoom out before\nwe zoom in.\nThe use of the zoom is the best part of graphing. Not only do we choose the domain\nand range, we change them. The viewing window is controlled by four numbers.\nThey can be the limits A\n¤ x\n¤ B and C\n¤ y\n¤ D. They can be the coordinates of two\nopposite corners: .A;C/ and .B;D/. They can be the center position .a;b/ and the\nscale factors c and d. Clicking on opposite corners of the zoom box is the fastest\nway, unless the center is unchanged and we only need to give scale factors. (Even\nfaster: Use the default factors.) Section 3:4 discusses the centering transform and\nzoom transform--a change of picture on the screen and a change of variable within\nthe function.\nEXAMPLE 5\nFind all real solutions to x4\n11x3 C5x\n2D0:\nEXAMPLE 6\nZoom out and in on the graphs of y D cos 40x and y D x sin.1=x/.\nDescribe what you see.\nEXAMPLE 7\nWhat does yD.tanx\nsinx/=x3 approach at xD0 ? For small x\nthe machine eventually can't separate tan x from sinx. It may give yD0. Can you\nget close enough to see the limit of y as x\nN 0 ?\nSYMBOLIC COMPUTATION\nIn symbolic computation, answers can be formulas as well as numbers and graphs.\nThe derivative of yDx2 is seen as \"2x.\" The derivative of sint is \"cost.\" The slope\nof bx is known to the program. The computer does more than substitute numbers into\nformulas--it operates directly on the formulas. We need to think where this fits with\nlearning calculus.\nIn a way, symbolic computing is close to what we ourselves do. Maybe too close--\nthere is some danger that symbolic manipulation is all we do. With a higher-level\nlanguage and enough power, a computer can print the derivative of sin.x2/. So why\nlearn the chain rule ? Because mathematics goes deeper than \"algebra with formulas.\"\nWe deal with ideas.\nI want to say clearly:Mathematics is not formulas or computations or even proofs,\nbut ideas. The symbols and pictures are the language. The book and the professor and\nthe computer can join in teaching it. The computer should be non-threatening (like\nthis book and your professor)--you can work at your own pace. Your part is to learn\nby doing.\n\nHighlights of Calculus\nEXAMPLE 8\nA computer algebra system quickly finds 100 factorial. This is\n100SD.100/.99/.98/:::.1/. The number has 158 digits (not written out here). The\nlast 24 digits are zeros. For 10SD3628800 there are seven digits and two zeros.\nBetween 10 and 100, and beyond, are simple questions that need ideas:\n1. How many digits (approximately) are in the number N S ?\n2. How many zeros (exactly) are at the end of NS ?\nFor Question 1, the computer shows more than N digits when N D100. It will\nnever show more than N 2 digits, because none of the N terms can have more than\nN digits. A much tighter bound would be 2N , but is it true ? Does N S always have\nfewer than 2N digits ?\nFor Question 2, the zeros in 10S can be explained. One comes from 10, the other\nfrom 5 times 2. .10 is also 5 times 2:/ Can you explain the 24 zeros in 100S ? An idea\nfrom the card game blackjack applies here too: Count the fives.\nHard question: How many zeros at the end of 200S?\nWriting in Calculus\nMay I emphasize the importance of writing ? We totally miss\nit, when the answer is just a number. A one-page report is harder on instructors as\nwell as students--but much more valuable. You can't write sentences without being\nforced to organize ideas--and part of yourself goes into it.\nI will propose a writing exercise with options. If you have computer-based\ngraphing, follow through on Examples 1\n4 above and report. Without a computer,\npick a paragraph from this book that should be clearer and make it clearer. Rewrite it\nwith examples. Identify the key idea at the start, explain it, and come back to express\nit differently at the end. Ideas are like surfaces--they can be seen many ways.\nMathematics can be learned by talking and writing--it is a human activity. Our\ngoal is not to test but to teach and learn.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Calculus\nGilbert Strang\nThe following may not correspond to a particular course on MIT OpenCourseWare, but has been\nprovided by the author as an individual learning resource.\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Calculus\nGilbert Strang\nThe following may not correspond to a particular course on MIT OpenCourseWare, but has been\nprovided by the author as an individual learning resource.\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "CHAPTER 1\nIntroduction to Calculus\n1.1 Velocity and Distance\nThe right way to begin a calculus book is with calculus. This chapter will jump\ndirectly into the two problems that the subject was invented to solve. You will see\nwhat the questions are, and you will see an important part of the answer. There are\nplenty of good things left for the other chapters, so why not get started ?\nThe book begins with an example that is familiar to everybody who drives a car. It is\ncalculus in action--the driver sees it happening. The example is the relation between\nthe speedometer and the odometer. One measures the speed (or velocity); the other\nmeasures the distance traveled. We will write v for the velocity, and f for how far\nthe car has gone. The two instruments sit together on the dashboard:\nFig. 1.1\nVelocity v and total distance f (at one instant of time).\nNotice that the units of measurement are different for v and f: The distance f is\nmeasured in kilometers or miles (it is easier to say miles). The velocity v is measured\nin km=hr or miles per hour. A unit of time enters the velocity but not the distance.\nEvery formula to compute v from f will have f divided by time.\nThe central question of calculus is the relation between v and f:\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nCan you find v if you know f; and vice versa, and how ? If we know the velocity over\nthe whole history of the car, we should be able to compute the total distance traveled.\nIn other words, if the speedometer record is complete but the odometer is missing,\nits information could be recovered. One way to do it (without calculus) is to put in\na new odometer and drive the car all over again at the right speeds. That seems like\na hard way; calculus may be easier. But the point is that the information is there.\nIf we know everything about v; there must be a method to find f:\nWhat happens in the opposite direction, when f is known? If you have a complete\nrecord of distance, could you recover the complete velocity? In principle you could\ndrive the car, repeat the history, and read off the speed. Again there must be a better\nway.\nThe whole subject of calculus is built on the relation between v and f: The question\nwe are raising here is not some kind of joke, after which the book will get serious\nand the mathematics will get started. On the contrary, I am serious now--and the\nmathematics has already started. We need to know how to find the velocity from a\nrecord of the distance. (That is called differentiation, and it is the central idea of\ndifferential calculus.) We also want to compute the distance from a history of the\nvelocity. (That is integration, and it is the goal of integral calculus.)\nDifferentiation goes from f to v; integration goes from v to f: We look first at\nexamples in which these pairs can be computed and understood.\nCONSTANT VELOCITY\nSuppose the velocity is fixed at v D 60 (miles per hour). Then f increases at this\nconstant rate. After two hours the distance is f D 120 (miles). After four hours\nf D 240 and after t hours f D 60t: We say that f increases linearly with time--\nits graph is a straight line.\nFig. 1.2\nConstant velocity v D 60 and linearly increasing distance f D 60t:\nNotice that this example starts the car at full velocity. No time is spent picking up\nspeed. (The velocity is a \"step function.\") Notice also that the distance starts at zero;\nthe car is new. Those decisions make the graphs of v and f as neat as possible. One is\nthe horizontal line v D 60: The other is the sloping line f D 60t: This v, f; t relation\nneeds algebra but not calculus:\nIf v is constant and f starts at zero then f D vt:\nThe opposite is also true. When f increases linearly, v is constant. The division by\ntime gives the slope. The distance is f1 D 120 miles when the time is t1 D 2 hours.\nLater f2 D 240 miles at t2 D 4 hours. At both points, the ratio f=t is 60 miles=hour.\nGeometrically, the velocity is the slope of the distance graph:\nslope D change in distance\nchange in time\nD vt\nt D v:\n\n1.1\nVelocity and Distance\nFig. 1.3\nStraight lines f D 20C60t (slope 60) and f D\n30t (slope\n30).\nThe slope of the f-graph gives the v-graph. Figure 1.3 shows two more possibilities:\n1. The distance starts at 20 instead of 0: The distance formula changes from 60t\nto 20C60t: The number 20 cancels when we compute change in distance--so\nthe slope is still 60:\n2. When v is negative, the graph of f goes downward. The car goes backward\nand the slope of f D\n30t is v D\n30:\nI don't think speedometers go below zero. But driving backwards, it's not that safe\nto watch. If you go fast enough, Toyota says they measure \"absolute values\"--the\nspeedometer reads C30 when the velocity is\n30: For the odometer, as far as I know\nit just stops. It should go backward.\nVELOCITY vs. DISTANCE: SLOPE vs. AREA\nHow do you compute f from v ? The point of the question is to see f D vt on the\ngraphs. We want to start with the graph of v and discover the graph of f: Amazingly,\nthe opposite of slope is area.\nThe distance f is the area under the v-graph. When v is constant, the region\nunder the graph is a rectangle. Its height is v, its width is t, and its area is v times t:\nThis is integration, to go from v to f by computing the area. We are glimpsing two\nof the central facts of calculus.\n1A The slope of the f-graph gives the velocity v. The area under the v-graph\ngives the distance f.\nThat is certainly not obvious, and I hesitated a long time before I wrote it down in\nthis first section. The best way to understand it is to look first at more examples. The\nwhole point of calculus is to deal with velocities that are not constant, and from now\non v has several values.\nEXAMPLE\n(Forward and back) There is a motion that you will understand right\naway. The car goes forward with velocity V; and comes back at the same speed. To\nsay it more correctly, the velocity in the second part is\nV: If the forward part lasts\nuntil t D 3, and the backward part continues to t D 6, the car will come back where it\nstarted. The total distance after both parts will be f D 0:\nThis actually happened in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, when the hero borrowed his father's\nsports car and ran up the mileage. At home he raised the car and drove in reverse. I forget if\nit worked.\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nFig. 1.4\nVelocities CV and\nV gives motion forward and back, ending at f .6/ D 0:\nThe v-graph shows velocities CV and\nV: The distance starts up with slope CV\nand reaches f D 3V: Then the car starts backward. The distance goes down with\nslope\nV and returns to f D 0 at t D 6:\nNotice what that means. The total area \"under\" the v-graph is zero! A negative\nvelocity makes the distance graph go downward (negative slope). The car is moving\nbackward. Area below the axis in the v-graph is counted as negative.\nFUNCTIONS\nThis forward-back example gives practice with a crucially important idea--the\nconcept of a \"function.\" We seize this golden opportunity to explain functions:\nThe number v.t/ is the value of the function v at the time t.\nThe time t is the input to the function. The velocity v.t/ at that time is the output.\nMost people say \"v of t\" when they read v.t/: The number \"v of 2\" is the velocity\nwhen t D 2: The forward-back example has v.2/ D CV and v.4/ D\nV: The func-\ntion contains the whole history, like a memory bank that has a record of v at each t:\nIt is simple to convert forward-back motion into a formula. Here is v.t/:\nv.t/ D\n$\n'\n&\n'\n%\nCV\nif\nt\n‹\nif\nt D 3\nV\nif\nt\nThe right side contains the instructions for finding v.t/: The input t is converted into\nthe output CV or\nV: The velocity v.t/ depends on t: In this case the function is\n\"discontinuous,\" because the needle jumps at t D 3: The velocity is not defined at that\ninstant. There is no v.3/: (You might argue that v is zero at the jump, but that leads\nto trouble.) The graph of f has a corner, and we can't give its slope.\nThe problem also involves a second function, namely the distance. The principle\nbehind f .t/ is the same: f .t/ is the distance at time t: It is the net distance forward,\nand again the instructions change at t D 3: In the forward motion, f .t/ equals V t as\nbefore. In the backward half, a calculation is built into the formula for f .t/:\nf .t/ D\n#\nV t\nif\n¤ t\n¤ 3\nV.6\nt/\nif\n¤ t\n¤ 6\nAt the switching time the right side gives two instructions (one on each line). This\nwould be bad except that they agree: f .3/ D 3V: The distance function is \"continu-\nous.\" There is no jump in f; even when there is a jump in v: After t D 3 the distance\ndecreases because of\nV t: At t D 6 the second instruction correctly gives f .6/ D 0:\nA function is only allowed one value f .t/ or v.t/ at each time t:\n\n1.1\nVelocity and Distance\nNotice something more. The functions were given by graphs before they were given\nby formulas. The graphs tell you f and v at every time t--sometimes more clearly\nthan the formulas. The values f .t/ and v.t/ can also be given by tables or equations\nor a set of instructions. (In some way all functions are instructions--the function tells\nhow to find f at time t:) Part of knowing f is knowing all its inputs and outputs--its\ndomain and range:\nThe domain of a function is the set of inputs. The range is the set of outputs.\nThe domain of f consists of all times 0\n¤ t\n¤ 6: The range consists of all distances\n¤ f .t/\n¤ 3V: (The range of v contains only the two velocities CV and\nV:)\nWe mention now, and repeat later, that every \"linear\" function has a formula\nf .t/ D vt CC: Its graph is a line and v is the slope. The constant C moves the line\nup and down. It adjusts the line to go through any desired starting point.\nSUMMARY: MORE ABOUT FUNCTIONS\nMay I collect together the ideas brought out by this example? We had two functions\nv and f: One was velocity, the other was distance. Each function had a domain, and\na range, and most important a graph. For the f-graph we studied the slope (which\nagreed with v). For the v-graph we studied the area (which agreed with f ). Calculus\nproduces functions in pairs, and the best thing a book can do early is to show you\nmore of them.\nin\nthe\ndomain\n$\n&\n%\ninput t\nN\nfunction f\nN\noutput f .t/\ninput 2\nN\nfunction v\nN\noutput v.2/\ninput 7\nN\nf .t/ D 2t C6\nN\nf .7/ D 20\n,\n.\n-\nin\nthe\nrange\nNote about the definition of a function. The idea behind the symbol f .t/ is\nabsolutely crucial to mathematics. Words don't do it justice! By definition, a function\nis a \"rule\" that assigns one member of the range to each member of the domain. Or,\na function is a set of pairs .t;f .t// with no t appearing twice. (These are \"ordered\npairs\" because we write t before f .t/:) Both of those definitions are correct--but\nsomehow they are too passive.\nIn practice what matters is the active part. The number f .t/ is produced from the\nnumber t: We read a graph, plug into a formula, solve an equation, run a computer\nprogram. The input t is \"mapped\" to the output f .t/, which changes as t changes.\nCalculus is about the rate of change. This rate is our other function v:\nFig. 1.5\nSubtracting 2 from f affects the range. Subtracting 2 from t affects the domain.\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nIt is quite hard at the beginning, and not automatic, to see the difference between\nf .t/\n2 and f .t\n2/: Those are both new functions, created out of the original f .t/:\nIn f .t/\n2, we subtract 2 from all the distances. That moves the whole graph down.\nIn f .t\n2/, we subtract 2 from the time. That moves the graph over to the right.\nFigure 1.5 shows both movements, starting from f .t/ D 2t C1: The formula to find\nf .t\n2/ is 2.t\n2/C1, which is 2t\n3:\nA graphing calculator also moves the graph, when you change the viewing window.\nYou can pick any rectangle A\n¤ t\n¤ B;C\n¤ f .t/\n¤ D: The screen shows that part of\nthe graph. But on the calculator, the function f .t/ remains the same. It is the axes that\nget renumbered. In our figures the axes stay the same and the function is changed.\nThere are two more basic ways to change a function. (We are always creating new\nfunctions--that is what mathematics is all about.) Instead of subtracting or adding,\nwe can multiply the distance by 2: Figure 1.6 shows 2f .t/: And instead of shifting\nthe time, we can speed it up. The function becomes f .2t/: Everything happens twice\nas fast (and takes half as long). On the calculator those changes correspondto a \"zoom\"\n--on the f axis or the t axis. We soon come back to zooms.\nFig. 1.6\nDoubling the distance or speeding up the time doubles the slope.\n1.1\nEXERCISES\nEach section of the book contains read-through questions.\nThey allow you to outline the section yourself--more actively\nthan reading a summary. This is probably the best way to\nremember the important ideas.\nStarting from f .0/ D 0 at constant velocity v, the distance func-\ntion is f .t/ D\na\n. When f .t/ D 55t the velocity is v D\nb\n.\nWhen f .t/ D 55t C1000 the velocity is still\nc\nand the starting\nvalue is f .0/ D\nd\n.

In\nthat case area in the v-graph counts as\nh\n.\nForward motion from f .0/ D 0 to f .2/ D 10 has v D\ni\n.Then\nbackward motion to f .4/ D 0 has v D\nj\n. The distance function\nis f .t/ D 5t for 0\n¤ t\n¤ 2 and then f .t/ D\nk\n(not\n5t). The\nslopes are\nl\nand\nm\n. The distance f .3/ D\nn\n. The area\nunder the v-graph up to time 1:5 is\no\n. The domain of f is the\ntime interval\np\n, and the range is the distance interval\nq\n.\nThe range of v.t/ is only\nr\n.\nThe value of f .t/ D 3t C1 at t D 2 is f .2/ D\ns\n. The value\n19 equals f (\nt\n). The difference f .4/\nf .1/ D\nu\n. That\nis the change in distance, when 4\n1 is the change in\nv\n.\nThe ratio of those changes equals\nw\n, which is the\nx\nof the\ngraph. The formula for f .t/C2 is 3t C3 whereas f .t C2/ equals\ny\n. Those functions have the same\nz\nas f W the graph\nof f .t/C2 is shifted\nA\nand f .t C2/ is shifted\nB\n.

The discussion is\njust about numbers--functions and slopes can wait. The numbers are not even special,\nthey can be any numbers. The crucial point is to look at their differences:\nSuppose the numbers are f D 0\nTheir differences are v D\nThe differences are printed in between, to show 2\n0 D 2 and 6\n2 D 4 and\n6 D 1: Notice how 4\n7 gives a negative answer\n3: The numbers in f can go\nup or down, the differences in v can be positive or negative. The idea behind calculus\ncomes when you add up those differences:\n2C4C1\n3C5 D 9\nThe sum of differences is 9: This is the last number on the top line (in f ). Is this an\naccident, or is this always true ? If we stop earlier, after 2C4C1, we get the 7 in f:\nTest any prediction on a second example:\nSuppose the numbers are f D 1\nTheir differences are v D\nThe f 's are increased by 1: The differences are exactly the same--no change. The\nsum of differences is still 9: But the last f is now 10: That prediction is not right, we\ndon't always get the last f:\nThe first f is now 1: The answer 9 (the sum of differences) is 10\n1, the last f\nminus the first f: What happens when we change the f 's in the middle ?\nSuppose the numbers are f D 1\nTheir differences are v D\nThe differences add to 4C7\n5C3 D 9: This is still 10\n1: No matter what f 's we\nchoose or how many, the sum of differences is controlled by the first f and last f:\nIf this is always true, there must be a clear reason why the middle f's cancel out.\nThe sum of differences is .5\n1/C.12\n5/C.7\n12/C.10\n7/ D 10\n1:\nThe 5's cancel, the 12's cancel, and the 7's cancel. It is only 10\n1 that doesn't cancel.\nThis is the key to calculus!\n1B The differences of the f 's add up to (flast\nffirst).\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe numbers grow linearly: f D\nTheir differences are constant: v D\nThe sum of differences is certainly 5: This agrees with 7\n2 D flast\nffirst: The\nnumbers in v remind us of constant velocity. The numbers in f remind us of a straight\nline f D vt CC: This example has v D 1 and the f 's start at 2: The straight line\nwould come from f D t C2:\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe numbers are squares: f D\nTheir differences grow linearly: v D\n1C3C5C7 agrees with 42 D 16: It is a beautiful fact that the first j odd numbers\nalways add up to j 2: The v's are the odd numbers, the f 's are perfect squares.\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nNote The letter j is sometimes useful to tell which number in f we are looking at.\nFor this example the zeroth number is f0 D 0 and the jth number is fj D j 2: This is a\npart of algebra, to give a formula for the f 's instead of a list of numbers. We can also\nuse j to tell which difference we are looking at. The first v is the first odd number\nv1 D 1: The jth difference is the jth odd number vj D 2j\n1: (Thus v4 is 8\n1 D 7:)\nIt is better to start the differences with j D 1, since there is no zeroth odd number v0:\nWith this notation the jth difference is vj D fj\nfj\n1: Sooner or later you will\nget comfortable with subscripts like j and j\n1, but it can be later. The important\npoint is that the sum of the v's equals flast\nffirst: We now connect the v's to slopes\nand the f 's to areas.\nFig. 1.7\nLinear increase in v D 1;3;5;7: Squares in the distances f D 0;1;4;9;16:\nFigure 1.7 shows a natural way to graph Example 2, with the odd numbers in v and\nthe squares in f: Notice an important difference between the v-graph and the f-graph.\nThe graphof f is \"piecewise linear.\" We plottedthe numbersin f and connectedthem\nby straight lines. The graph of v is \"piecewise constant.\" We plotted the differences\nas constant over each piece. This reminds us of the distance-velocity graphs, when\nthe distance f .t/ is a straight line and the velocity v.t/ is a horizontal line.\nNow make the connection to slopes:\nThe slope of the f-graph is\ndistance up\ndistance across D change in f\nchange in t D v:\nOver each piece, the change in t (across) is 1: The change in f (upward) is the\ndifference that we are calling v: The ratio is the slope v=1 or just v: The slope makes\na sudden change at the breakpoints t D 1;2;3; :::. At those special points the slope\nof the f-graph is not defined--we connected the v's by vertical lines but this is very\ndebatable. The main idea is that between the breakpoints, the slope of f .t/ is v.t/.\nNow make the connection to areas:\nThe total area under the v-graph is flast\nffirst:\nThis area, underneath the staircase in Figure 1.7, is composed of rectangles. The base\nof every rectangle is 1: The heights of the rectangles are the v's. So the areas also\nequal the v's, and the total area is the sum of the v's. This area is flast\nffirst:\nEven more is true. We could start at any time and end at any later time--\nnot necessarily at the special times t D 0;1;2;3;4: Suppose we stop at t D 3:5: Only\nhalf of the last rectangular area (under v D 7) will be counted. The total area is\n1C3C5C 1\n2.7/ D 12:5: This still agrees with flast\nffirst D 12:5\n0: At this\nnew ending time t D 3:5, we are only halfway up the last step in the f-graph. Halfway\nbetween 9 and 16 is 12:5:\n\n1.2\nCalculus Without Limits\n1C The v's are slopes of f .t/: The area under the v-graph is f .tend/\nf .tstart/:\nThis is nothing less than the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. But we have only\nused algebra (no curved graphs and no calculations involving limits). For now the\nTheorem is restricted to piecewise linear f .t/ and piecewise constant v.t/: In\nChapter 5 that restriction will be overcome.\nNotice that a proof of 1C3C5C7 D 42 is suggested by Figure 1.7a. The triangle\nunder the dotted line has the same area as the four rectangles under the staircase. The\narea of the triangle is 1\nbase\nheight D 1\n8, which is the perfect square 42: When\nthere are j rectangles instead of 4, we get 1\nj\n2j D j 2 for the area.\nThe next examples show other patterns, where f and v increase exponentially or\noscillate around zero. I hope you like them but I don't think you have to learn them.\nThey are like the special functions 2t and sin t and cos t--except they go in steps.\nYou get a first look at the important functions of calculus, but you only need algebra.\nCalculus is needed for a steadily changing velocity, when the graph of f is curved.\nThe last example will be income tax--which really does go in steps. Then\nSection 1:3 will introduce the slope of a curve. The crucial step for curves is working\nwith limits. That will take us from algebra to calculus.\nEXPONENTIAL VELOCITY AND DISTANCE\nStart with the numbers f D 1;2;4;8;16: These are \"powers of 2:\" They start with the\nzeroth power, which is 20 D 1: The exponential starts at 1 and not 0. After j steps\nthere are j factors of 2, and fj equals 2j: Please recognize the difference between\n2j and j 2 and 2j. The numbers 2j grow linearly, the numbers j 2 grow quadratically,\nthe numbers 2j grow exponentially. At j D 10 these are 20 and 100 and 1024: The\nexponential 2j quickly becomes much larger than the others.\nThe differences of f D 1;2;4;8;16 are exactly v D 1;2;4;8: We get the same\nbeautiful numbers. When the f 's are powers of 2; so are the v's. The formula\nvj D 2j\n1 is slightly different from fj D 2j , because the first v is numbered v1: (Then\nv1 D 20 D 1: The zeroth power of every number is 1, except that 00 is meaningless.)\nThe two graphs in Figure 1.8 use the same numbers but they look different, because\nf is piecewise linear and v is piecewise constant.\nFig. 1.8\nThe velocity and distance grow exponentially (powers of 2).\nWhere will calculus come in ? It works with the smooth curve f .t/ D 2t: This\nexponential growth is critically important for population and money in a bank and the\nnational debt. You can spot it by the following test: v.t/ is proportional to f .t/:\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nRemark\nThe function 2t is trickier than t2: For f D t2 the slope is v D 2t: It is\nproportional to t and not t2: For f D 2t the slope is v D c2t, and we won't find the\nconstant c D :693::: until Chapter 6: (The number c is the natural logarithm of 2:)\nProblem 37 estimates c with a calculator--the important thing is that it's constant.\nOSCILLATING VELOCITY AND DISTANCE\nWe have seen a forward-back motion, velocity V followed by\nV: That is oscillation\nof the simplest kind. The graph of f goes linearly up and linearly down. Figure 1.9\nshows another oscillation that returns to zero, but the path is more interesting.\nThe numbers in f are now 0;1;1;0;\n1;\n1;0: Since f6 D 0 the motion brings us\nback to the start. The whole oscillation can be repeated.\nThe differences in v are 1;0;\n1;\n1;0;1: They add up to zero, which agrees with\nflast\nffirst: It is the same oscillation as in f (and also repeatable), but shifted in time.\nThe f-graph resembles (roughly) a sine curve. The v-graph resembles (even more\nroughly) a cosine curve. The waveforms in nature are smooth curves, while these are\n\"digitized\"--the way a digital watch goes forward in jumps. You recognize that the\nchange from analog to digital brought the computer revolution. The same revolution\nis coming in CD players. Digital signals (off or on, 0 or 1) seem to win every time.\nThe piecewise v and f start again at t D 6: The ordinary sine and cosine repeat at\nt D 2: A repeating motion is periodic--here the \"period\" is 6 or 2: (With t in\ndegrees the period is 360--a full circle. The period becomes 2 when angles are mea-\nsured in radians. We virtually always use radians--which are degrees times 2=360:)\nA watch has a period of 12 hours. If the dial shows AM and PM, the period is\n:\nFig. 1.9\nPiecewise constant \"cosine\" and piecewise linear \"sine.\" They both repeat.\nA SHORT BURST OF SPEED\nThe next example is a car that is driven fast for a short time. The speed is V until the\ndistance reaches f D 1, when the car suddenly stops. The graph of f goes up linearly\nwith slope V , and then across with slope zero:\nv.t/ D\n#\nV\nup to\nt D T\nafter\nt D T\nf .t/ D\n\"\nV t\nup to\nt D T\nafter\nt D T\nThis is another example of \"function notation.\" Notice the general time t and the\nparticular stopping time T: The distance is f .t/: The domain of f (the inputs)\nincludes all times t\n¥ 0: The range of f (the outputs) includes all distances 0\n¤ f\n¤ 1:\nFigure 1.10 allows us to compare three cars--a Jeep and a Corvette and a Maserati.\nThey have different speeds but they all reach f D 1: So the areas under the v-graphs\nare all 1: The rectangles have height V and base T D 1=V:\n\n1.2\nCalculus Without Limits\nFig. 1.10\nBursts of speed with VM TM D VC TC D VJ TJ D 1: Step function has infinite\nslope.\nOptional remark It is natural to think about faster and faster speeds, which means\nsteeper slopes. The f-graph reaches 1 in shorter times. The extreme case is a step\nfunction, when the graph of f goes straight up. This is the unit step U.t/, which is\nzero up to t D 0 and jumps immediately to U D 1 for t\n¡ 0:\nWhat is the slope of the step function ? It is zero except at the jump. At that moment,\nwhich is t D 0, the slope is infinite. We don't have an ordinary velocity v.t/--instead\nwe have an impulse that makes the car jump. The graph is a spike over the single point\nt D 0, and it is often denoted by ı--so the slope of the step function is called a \"delta\nfunction.\" The area under the infinite spike is 1:\nYou are absolutely not responsible for the theory of delta functions! Calculus is\nabout curves, not jumps.\nOur last example is a real-world application of slopes ands rates--to explain \"how\ntaxes work.\" Note especially the difference between tax rates and tax brackets and\ntotal tax. The rates are v, the brackets are on x, the total tax is f:\nEXAMPLE 3\nIncome tax is piecewise linear. The slopes are the tax rates :15; :28; :31:\nSuppose you are single with taxable income of x dollars (Form 1040; line 37--after\nall deductions). These are the 1991 instructions from the Internal Revenue Service:\nIf x is not over $20;350; the tax is 15% of x:\nIf $20;350\n¤ x\n¤ $49;300; the tax is $3052:50C28% of the amount over $20;350:\nIf x is over $49;300; the tax is $11;158:50C31% of the amount over $49;300:\nThe first bracket is 0\n¤ x\n¤ $20;350: (The IRS never uses this symbol\n¤, but I think\nit is OK here.We know what it means.)Thesecond bracket is $20;350\n¤ x\n¤ $49;300:\nThe top bracket x\n¥ $49;300 pays tax at the top rate of 31%: But only the income in\nthat bracket is taxed at that rate.\nFigure 1.11 shows the rates and the brackets and the tax due. Those are not average\nrates, they are marginal rates. Total tax divided by total income would be the average\nrate. The marginal rate of .28 or :31 gives the tax on each additional dollar of income--\nit is the slope at the point x: Tax is like area or distance--it adds up. Tax rate is like\nslope or velocity--it depends where you are. This is often unclear in the news media.\nQuestion What is the equation for the straight line in the top bracket?\nAnswer\nThe bracket begins at x D $49;300 when the tax is f .x/ D $11;158:50:\nThe slope of the line is the tax rate :31: When we know a point on the line and the\nslope, we know the equation. This is important enough to be highlighted.\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nFig. 1.11\nThe tax rate is v, the total tax is f: Tax brackets end at breakpoints.\n1D For x in the top bracket the tax is f .x/ D $11;158:50C:31.x\n$49;300/:\nThis is the tax on $49;300 plus the extra tax on extra income.\nSection 2:3 presents this \"point-slope equation\" for any straight line. Here you see it\nfor one specific example. Where does the number $11;158:50 come from ? It is the\ntax at the end of the middle bracket, so it is the tax at the start of the top bracket.\nFigure 1.11 also shows a distance-velocity example. The distance at t D 2 is\nf .2/ D 40 miles. After that time the velocity is 60 miles per hour. So the line with\nslope 60 on the f-graph has the equation\nf .t/ D starting distance C extra distance D 40C60.t\n2/:\nThe starting point is .2;40/: The new speed 60 multiplies the extra time t\n2: The\npoint-slope equation makes sense. We now review this section, with comments.\nCentral idea Start with any numbers in f: Their differences go in v: Then the sum of\nthose differences is flast\nffirst:\nSubscript notation The numbers are f0;f1; :::\nand the first difference is\nv1 D f1\nf0: A typical number is fj and the jth difference is vj D fj\nfj\n1: When\nthose differences are added, all f 's in the middle (like f1) cancel out:\nv1 Cv2 C\n\nCvj D .f 1\nf 0/C.f 2\nf 1/C\n\nC.f j\nf j\n1/ D f j\nf 0:\nExamples fj D j or j 2 or 2j : Then vj D 1 (constant) or 2j\n1 (odd numbers)\nor 2j\n1:\nFunctions Connect the f 's to be piecewise linear. Then the slope v is piecewise con-\nstant. The area under the v-graph from any tstart to any tend equals f .tend/\nf .tstart/:\nUnits Distance in miles and velocity in miles per hour. Tax in dollars and tax rate in\n(dollars paid)=(dollars earned). Tax rate is a percentage like :28, with no units.\n1.2\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nStart with the\nnumbers\nf D 1;6;2;5:\nTheir differences\nare\nv D\na\n.

There are\ntwo questions, in opposite directions, and I hope you could see them coming.\n1. If the velocity is changing, how can you compute the distance traveled ?\n2. If the graph of f .t/ is not a straight line, what is its slope ?\nFind the distance from the velocity, find the velocity from the distance. Our goal is to\ndo both--but not in one section. Calculus may be a good course, but it is not magic.\nThe first step is to let the velocity change in the steadiest possible way.\nQuestion 1\nSuppose the velocity at each time t is v.t/ D 2t: Find f .t/:\nWith v D 2t, a physicist would say that the acceleration is constant (it equals 2). The\ndriver steps on the gas, the car accelerates, and the speedometer goes steadily up. The\ndistance goes up too--faster and faster. If we measure t in seconds and v in feet per\nsecond, the distance f comes out in feet. After 10 seconds the speed is 20 feet per\nsecond. After 44 seconds the speed is 88 feet=second (which is 60 miles=hour). The\nacceleration is clear, but how far has the car gone ?\nQuestion 2\nThe distance traveled by time t is f .t/ D t2: Find the velocity v.t/:\nThe graph of f .t/ D t2 is on the right of Figure 1.12. It is a parabola. The curve\nstarts at zero, when the car is new. At t D 5 the distance is f D 25: By t D 10;f\nreaches 100:\nVelocity is distance divided by time, but what happens when the speed is changing?\nDividing f D 100 by t D 10 gives v D 10--the average velocity over the first ten\nseconds. Dividing f D 121 by t D 11 gives the average speed over 11 seconds. But\nhow do we find the instantaneous velocity--the reading on the speedometer at the\nexact instant when t D 10 ?\nFig. 1.12\nThe velocity v D 2t is linear. The distance f D t2 is quadratic.\nI hope you see the problem. As the car goes faster, the graph of t2 gets steeper--\nbecause more distance is covered in each second. The average velocity between t D 10\nand t D 11 is a good approximation--but only an approximation--to the speed at the\nmoment t D 10: Averages are easy to find:\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\ndistance at t D 10 is f .10/ D 102 D 100\ndistance at t D 11 is f .11/ D 112 D 121\naverage velocity is f .11/\nf .10/\nD 121\nD 21:\nThe car covered 21 feet in that 1 second. Its average speed was 21 feet=second. Since\nit was gaining speed, the velocity at the beginning of that second was below 21:\nGeometrically, what is the average? It is a slope, but not the slope of the curve.\nThe average velocity is the slope of a straight line. The line goes between two points\non the curve in Figure 1.12. When we compute an average, we pretend the velocity is\nconstant--so we go back to the easiest case. It only requires a division of distance by\ntime:\naverage velocityD change in f\nchange in t :\n(1)\nCalculus and the Law You enter a highway at 1 W 00: If you exit 150 miles away at\n3 W 00, your average speed is 75 miles per hour.

You could say to the judge, \"When was I doing 75 ? \" The police would have\nto admit that they have no idea--but they would have a definite feeling that you must\nhave been doing 75 sometime.\nWe return to the central problem--computing v.10/ at the instant t D 10: The\naverage velocity over the next second is 21: We can also find the average over the\nhalf-second between t D 10:0 and t D 10:5: Divide the change in distance by the\nchange in time:\nf .10:5/\nf .10:0/\n10:5\n10:0\nD .10:5/2\n.10:0/2\n:5\nD 110:25\n:5\nD 20:5:\nThat average of 20:5 is closer to the speed at t D 10: It is still not exact.\nThe way to find v.10/ is to keep reducing the time interval. This is the basis for\nChapter 2; and the key to differential calculus. Find the slope between points that\nare closer and closer on the curve. The \"limit\" is the slope at a single point.\nAlgebra gives the average velocity between t D 10 and any later time t D 10Ch:\nThe distance increases from 102 to .10Ch/2: The change in time is h: So divide:\nvaverage D .10Ch/2\nh\nD 100C20hCh2\nh\nD 20Ch:\n(2)\nThis formula fits our previous calculations. The interval from t D 10 to t D 11 had\nh D 1, and the average was 20Ch D 21: When the time step was h D 1\n2, the\naverage was 20C 1\n2 D 20:5: Over a millionth of a second the average will be 20\nplus 1=1;000;000--which is very near 20:\nConclusion: The velocity at t D 10 is v D 20. That is the slope of the curve. It\nagrees with the v-graph on the left side of Figure 1.12, which also has v.10/ D 20:\nThis is our first encounter with the much despised \"Mean Value Theorem.\" If the judge can\nprove the theorem, you are dead. A few v-graphs and f-graphs will confuse the situation.\n\n1.3\nThe Velocity at an Instant\nWe now show that the two graphs match at all times. If f .t/ D t2 then v.t/ D 2t:\nYou are seeing the key computation of calculus, and we can put it into words before\nequations. Compute the distance at time t Ch, subtract the distance at time t, and\ndivide by h: That gives the average velocity:\nvave D f .t Ch/\nf .t/\nh\nD .t Ch/2\nt2\nh\nD t2 C2thCh2\nt2\nh\nD 2t Ch:\n(3)\nThis fits the previous calculation, where t was 10: The average was 20Ch: Now the\naverage is 2t Ch: It depends on the time step h, because the velocity is changing. But\nwe can see what happens as h approaches zero. The average is closer and closer to\nthe speedometer reading of 2t, at the exact moment when the clock shows time t:\n1E As h approaches zero, the average velocity 2t Ch approaches v.t/ D 2t:\nNote\nThe computation (3) shows how calculus needs algebra. If we want the whole\nv-graph, we have to let time be a \"variable.\" It is represented by the letter t: Numbers\nare enough at the specific time t D 10 and the specific step h D 1--but algebra gets\nbeyond that. The average between any t and any t Ch is 2t Ch: Please don't hesitate\nto put back numbers for the letters--that checks the algebra.\nThere is also a step beyond algebra! Calculus requires the limit of the average.\nAs h shrinks to zero, the points on the graph come closer. \"Average over an interval\"\nbecomes \"velocity at an instant.\" The general theory of limits is not particularly\nsimple, but here we don't need it. (It isn't particularly hard either.) In this example\nthe limiting value is easy to identify. The average 2t Ch approaches 2t, as h\nN 0:\nWhat remains to do in this section ? We answered Question 2--to find velocity\nfrom distance. We have not answered Question 1: If v.t/ D 2t increases linearly with\ntime, what is the distance ? This goes in the opposite direction (it is integration).\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that no new work is necessary. If the\nslope of f .t/ leads to v.t/, then the area under that v-graph leads back to the\nf-graph. The odometer readings f D t2 produced speedometer readings v D 2t:\nBy the Fundamental Theorem, the area under 2t should be t2: But we have certainly\nnot proved any fundamental theorems, so it is better to be safe--by actually\ncomputing the area.\nFortunately, it is the area of a triangle. The base of the triangle is t and the height is\nv D 2t: The area agrees with f .t/:\narea D 1\n2.base/.height/ D 1\n2.t/.2t/ D t2:\n(4)\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe graphs are shifted in time. The car doesn't start until t D 1:\nTherefore v D 0 and f D 0 up to that time. After the car starts we have v D 2.t\n1/\nand f D .t\n1/2: You see how the time delay of 1 enters the formulas. Figure 1.13\nshows how it affects the graphs.\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe acceleration changes from 2 to another constant a: The velocity\nchanges from v D 2t to v D at: The acceleration is the slope of the velocity curve!\nThe distance is also proportional to a, but notice the factor 1\n2:\nacceleration a\no\nvelocity v D at\no\ndistance f D 1\n2at2:\nIf a equals 1, then v D t and f D 1\n2t2: That is one of the most famous pairs in\ncalculus. If a equals the gravitational constant g, then v D gt is the velocity of a\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nFig. 1.13\nDelayed velocity and distance. The pairs v D at Cb and f D 1\n2at2 Cbt:\nfalling body. The speed doesn't depend on the mass (tested by Galileo at the\nLeaning Tower of Pisa). Maybe he saw the distance f D 1\n2gt2 more easily than the\nspeed v D gt: Anyway, this is the most famous pair in physics.\nEXAMPLE 3\nSuppose f .t/ D 3t Ct2: The average velocity from t to t Ch is\nvave D f .t Ch/\nf .t/\nh\nD 3.t Ch/C.t Ch/2\n3t\nt2\nh\n:\nThe change in distance has an extra 3h (coming from 3.t Ch/ minus 3t). The velocity\ncontains an additional 3 (coming from 3h divided by h). When 3t is added to the\ndistance, 3 is added to the velocity. If Galileo had thrown a weight instead of dropping\nit, the starting velocity v0 would have added v0t to the distance.\nFUNCTIONS ACROSS TIME\nThe idea of slope is not difficult--for one straight line. Divide the change in f by\nthe change in t: In Chapter 2; divide the change in y by the change in x: Experience\nshows that the hard part is to see what happens to the slope as the line moves.\nFigure 1.14a shows the line between points A and B on the curve. This is a \"secant\nline.\" Its slope is an average velocity. What calculus does is to bring that point B\ndown the curve toward A:\nFig. 1.14\nSlope of line, slope of curve. Two velocity graphs. Which is which ?\nQuestion 1\nWhat happens to the \"change in f \"--the height of B above A ?\nAnswer\nThe change in f decreases to zero. So does the change in t:\n\n1.3\nThe Velocity at an Instant\nQuestion 2\nAs B approaches A, does the slope of the line increase or decrease?\nAnswer\nI am not going to answer that question. It is too important. Draw another\nsecant line with B closer to A: Compare the slopes.\nThis question was created by Steve Monk at the University of Washington--where\n57% of the class gave the right answer. Probably 97% would have found the right\nslope from a formula. Figure 1.14b shows the opposite problem. We know the\nvelocity, not the distance. But calculus answers questions about both functions.\nQuestion 3\nWhich car is going faster at time t D 3=4 ?\nAnswer\nCar C has higher speed. Car D has greater acceleration.\nQuestion 4\nIf the cars start together, is D catching up to C at the end ? Between\nt D 1\n2 and t D 1, do the cars get closer or further apart ?\nAnswer\nThis time more than half the class got it wrong. You won't but you can see\nwhy they did. You have to look at the speed graph and imagine the distance graph.\nWhen car C is going faster, the distance between them\n:\nTo repeat: The cars start together, but they don't finish together. They reach the\nsame speed at t D 1, not the same distance. Car C went faster. You really should draw\ntheir distance graphs, to see how they bend.\nThese problems help to emphasize one more point. Finding the speed (or slope) is\nentirely different from finding the distance (or area):\n1. To find the slope of the f-graph at a particular time t, you don't have to know\nthe whole history.\n2. To find the area under the v-graph up to a particular time t, you do have to\nknow the whole history.\nA short record of distance is enough to recover v.t/: Point B moves toward point A:\nThe problem of slope is local--the speed is completely decided by f .t/ near point A:\nIn contrast, a short record of speed is not enough to recover the total distance. We\nhave to know what the mileage was earlier. Otherwise we can only know the increase\nin mileage, not the total.\n1.3\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nBetween\nthe\ndistances\nf .2/ D 100\nand\nf .6/ D 200,\nthe\naverage velocity is\na\n.

As I write that last word, I ask myself how much\ntrigonometry it is essential to know. There will be the basic picture of a right\ntriangle, with sides cos t and sin t and 1: There will also be the crucial equation\n.cos t/2 C.sin t/2 D 1, which is Pythagoras' law a2 Cb2 D c2: The squares of two\nsides add to the square of the hypotenuse (and the 1 is really 12). Nothing else is\nneeded immediately. If you don't know trigonometry, don't stop--an important part\ncan be learned now.\nYou will recognize the wavy graphs of the sine and cosine. We intend to find the\nslopes of those graphs. That can be done without using the formulas for sin.x Cy/\nand cos.x Cy/--which later give the same slopes in a more algebraic way. Here it is\nonly basic things that are needed. And anyway, how complicated can a triangle be ?\nRemark\nYou might think trigonometry is only for surveyors and navigators\n(people with triangles). Not at all! By far the biggest applications are to rotation and\nvibration and oscillation. It is fantastic that sines and cosines are so perfect for\n\"repeating motion\"--around a circle or up and down.\nFig. 1.15\nAs the angle t changes, the graphs show the sides of the right triangle.\nOur underlying goal is to offer one more example in which the velocity can be\ncomputed by common sense. Calculus is mainly an extension of common sense, but\nhere that extension is not needed. We will find the slope of the sine curve. The straight\nline f D vt was easy and the parabola f D 1\n2at2 was harder. The new example also\ninvolves realistic motion, seen every day. We start with circular motion, in which the\nposition is given and the velocity will be found.\nA ball goes around a circle of radius one. The center is at x D 0;y D 0 (the\norigin). The x and y coordinates satisfy x2 Cy2 D 12, to keep the ball on the circle.\nWe specify its position in Figure 1.16a by giving its angle with the horizontal. And\nwe make the ball travel with constant speed, by requiring that the angle is equal to\nthe time t: The ball goes counterclockwise. At time 1 it reaches the point where the\nangle equals 1: The angle is measured in radians rather than degrees, so a full circle\nis completed at t D 2 instead of t D 360:\nThe ball starts on the x axis, where the angle is zero. Now find it at time t:\nThe ball is at the point where x D cos t and y D sin t:\nSines and cosines are so important that I added a review of trigonometry in Section 1:5: But\nthe concepts in this section can be more valuable than formulas.\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nThis is where trigonometry is useful. The cosine oscillates between 1 and\n1, as the\nball goes from far right to far left and back again. The sine also oscillates between 1\nand\n1, starting from sin 0 D 0: At time =2 the sine (the height) increases to one.\nThe cosine is zero and the ball reaches the top point x D 0;y D 1: At time the cosine\nis\n1 and the sine is back to zero--the coordinates are .1;0/: At t D 2 the circle\nis complete (the angle is also 2), and x D cos 2 D 1; y D sin 2 D 0:\nFig. 1.16\nCircular motion with speed 1; angle t, height sin t, upward velocity cos t:\nImportant point: The distance around the circle (its circumference) is 2r D 2,\nbecause the radius is 1: The ball travels a distance 2 in a time 2: The speed equals\n1: It remains to find the velocity, which involves not only speed but direction.\nDegrees vs. radians A full circle is 360 degrees and 2 radians. Therefore\n1 radian D360=2 degrees\n57:3 degrees\n1 degreeD2=360 radians\n:01745 radians\nRadians were invented to avoid those numbers! The speed is exactly 1; reaching t\nradians at time t: The speed would be :01745; if the ball only reached t degrees. The\nball would complete the circle at time T D 360: We cannot accept the division of the\ncircle into 360 pieces (by whom? ), which produces these numbers.\nTo check degree mode vs. radian mode, verify that sin 1\n\n:017 and sin 1\n:84:\nVELOCITY OF THE BALL\nAt time t, which direction is the ball going? Calculus watches the motion between t\nand t Ch: For a ball on a string, we don't need calculus--just let go. The direction of\nmotion is tangent to the circle. With no force to keep it on the circle, the ball goes off\non a tangent. If the ball is the moon, the force is gravity. If it is a hammer swinging\naround on a chain, the force is from the center. When the thrower lets go, the hammer\ntakes off--and it is an art to pick the right moment. (I once saw a friend hit by a\nhammer at MIT. He survived, but the thrower quit track.) Calculus will find that same\ntangent direction, when the points at t and t Ch come close.\nThe \"velocity triangle\" is in Figure 1.16b. It is the same as the position triangle,\nbut rotated through 90\n: The hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, in the direction the\nball is moving. Its length equals 1 (the speed). The angle t still appears, but now it\nis the angle with the vertical. The upward component of velocity is cos t; when the\nupward component of position is sin t: That is our common sense calculation, based\n\n1.4\nCircular Motion\non a figure rather than a formula. The rest of this section depends on it--and we check\nv D cos t at special points.\nAt the starting time t D 0, the movement is all upward. The height is sin 0 D 0 and\nthe upward velocity is cos 0 D 1: At time =2, the ball reaches the top. The height\nis sin =2 D 1 and the upward velocity is cos =2 D 0: At that instant the ball is not\nmoving up or down.\nThe horizontal velocity contains a minus sign. At first the ball travels to the left. The\nvalue of x is cos t, but the speed in the x direction is\nsin t: Half of trigonometry\nis in that figure (the good half), and you see how sin2t Ccos2t D 1 is so basic. That\nequation applies to position and velocity, at every time.\nApplication of plane geometry: The right triangles in Figure 1.16 are the same\nsize and shape. They look congruent and they are--the angle t above the ball equals\nthe angle t at the center. That is because the three angles at the ball add to 180\n.\nOSCILLATION: UP AND DOWN MOTION\nWe now use circular motion to study straight-line motion. That line will be the y axis.\nInstead of a ball going around a circle, a mass will move up and down. It oscillates\nbetween y D 1 and y D\n1: The mass is the \"shadow of the ball,\" as we explain in a\nmoment.\nThere is a jumpy oscillation that we do not want, with v D 1 and v D\n1: That\n\"bang-bang\" velocity is like a billiard ball, bouncing between two walls without\nslowing down. If the distance between the walls is 2; then at t D 4 the ball is back\nto the start. The distance graph is a zigzag (or sawtooth) from Section 1:2:\nWe prefer a smoother motion. Instead of velocities that jump between C1 and\n1,\na real oscillation slows down to zero and gradually builds up speed again. The mass\nis on a spring, which pulls it back. The velocity drops to zero as the spring is fully\nstretched. Then v is negative, as the mass goes the same distance in the opposite\ndirection. Simple harmonic motion is the most important back and forth motion,\nwhile f D vt and f D 1\n2at2 are the most important one-way motions.\nFig. 1.17\nCircular motion of the ball and harmonic motion of the mass (its shadow).\nHow do we describe this oscillation ? The best way is to match it with the ball on\nthe circle. The height of the ball will be the height of the mass. The \"shadow of the\nball\" goes up and down, level with the ball. As the ball passes the top of the circle, the\nmass stops at the top and starts down. As the ball goes around the bottom, the mass\nstops and turns back up the y axis. Halfway up (or down), the speed is 1:\nFigure 1.17a shows the mass at a typical time t: The height is y D f .t/ D sin t,\nlevel with the ball. This height oscillates between f D 1 and f D\n1: But the mass\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\ndoes not move with constant speed. The speed of the mass is changing although the\nspeed of the ball is always 1. The time for a full cycle is still 2, but within that cycle\nthe mass speeds up and slows down. The problem is to find the changing velocity v:\nSince the distance is f D sin t, the velocity will be the slope of the sine curve.\nTHE SLOPE OF THE SINE CURVE\nAt the top and bottom (t D =2 and t D 3=2) the ball changes direction and v D 0:\nThe slope at the top and bottom of the sine curve is zero. At time zero, when the ball\nis going straight up, the slope of the sine curve is v D 1: At t D , when the ball and\nmass and f-graph are going down, the velocity is v D\n1: The mass goes fastest at the\ncenter. The mass goes slowest (in fact it stops) when the height reaches a maximum\nor minimum. The velocity triangle yields v at every time t:\nTo find the upward velocity of the mass, look at the upward velocity of the ball.\nThose velocities are the same! The mass and ball stay level, and we know v from\ncircular motion: The upward velocity is v D cos t:\nFigure 1.18 shows the result we want. On the right, f D sin t gives the height. On\nthe left is the velocity v D cos t: That velocity is the slope of the f-curve. The height\nand velocity (red lines) are oscillating together, but they are out of phase--just as the\nposition triangle and velocity triangle were at right angles. This is absolutely fantastic,\nthat in calculus the two most famous functions of trigonometry form a pair: The slope\nof the sine curve is given by the cosine curve.\nWhen the distance is f .t/ D sin t, the velocity is v.t/ D cos t:\nAdmission of guilt: The slope of sin t was not computed in the standard way.\nPreviously we compared .t Ch/2 with t2, and divided that distance by h: This average\nvelocity approached the slope 2t as h became small. For sin t we could have done\nthe same:\naverage velocityD change in sin t\nchange in t\nD sin.t Ch/\nsin t\nh\n:\n(1)\nThis is where we need the formula for sin.t Ch/, coming soon. Somehow the ratio\nin (1) should approach cos t as h\nN 0: (It does.) The sine and cosine fit the same\npattern as t2 and 2t--our shortcut was to watch the shadow of motion around a circle.\nFig. 1.18\nv D cos t when f D sin t (red); v D\nsin t when f D cos t (black).\nThat looks easy but you will see later that it is extremely important. At a maximum or\nminimum the slope is zero. The curve levels off.\n\n1.4\nCircular Motion\nQuestion 1\nWhat if the ball goes twice as fast, to reach angle 2t at time t ?\nAnswer\nThe speed is now 2: The time for a full circle is only : The ball's\nposition is x D cos 2t and y D sin 2t: The velocity is still tangent to the circle--but\nthe tangent is at angle 2t where the ball is. Therefore cos 2t enters the upward\nvelocity and\nsin 2t enters the horizontal velocity. The difference is that the\nvelocity triangle is twice as big. The upward velocity is not cos 2t but 2cos 2t: The\nhorizontal velocity is\n2sin 2t: Notice these 2's!\nQuestion 2\nWhat is the area under the cosine curve from t D 0 to t D =2 ?\nYou can answer that, if you accept the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus--\ncomputing areas is the opposite of computing slopes. The slope of sin t is cos t,\nso the area under cos t is the increase in sin t: No reason to believe that yet, but we\nuse it anyway.\nFrom sin 0 D 0 to sin =2 D 1, the increase is 1: Please realize the power of\ncalculus. No other method could compute the area under a cosine curve so fast.\nTHE SLOPE OF THE COSINE CURVE\nI cannot resist uncovering another distance and velocity (another f-v pair) with no\nextra work. This time f is the cosine. The time clock starts at the top of the circle.\nThe old time t D =2 is now t D 0: The dotted lines in Figure 1.18 show the new start.\nBut the shadow has exactly the same motion--the ball keeps going around the circle,\nand the mass follows it up and down. The f-graph and v-graph are still correct, both\nwith a time shift of =2:\nThe new f-graph is the cosine. The new v-graph is minus the sine. The slope of\nthe cosine curve follows the negative of the sine curve. That is another famous pair,\ntwins of the first:\nWhen the distance is f .t/ D cos t; the velocity is v.t/ D\nsin t:\nYou could see that coming, by watching the ball go left and right (instead of up and\ndown). Its distance across is f D cos t: Its velocity across is v D\nsin t: That twin\npair completes the calculus in Chapter 1 (trigonometry to come). We review the ideas:\nv is the velocity\nthe slope of the distance curve\nthe limit of average velocity over a short time\nthe derivative of f:\nf is the distance\nthe area under the velocity curve\nthe limit of total distance over many short times\nthe integral of v:\nDifferential calculus: Compute v from f .\nIntegral calculus: Compute f from v:\nWith constant velocity, f equals vt: With constant acceleration, v D at and f D 1\n2at2:\nIn harmonic motion, v D cos t and f D sin t: One part of our goal is to extend that\nlist--for which we need the tools of calculus. Another and more important part is to\nput these ideas to use.\nBefore the chapter ends, may I add a note about the book and the course? The\nbook is more personal than usual, and I hope readers will approve. What I write is\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nvery close to what I would say, if you were in this room. The sentences are spoken\nbefore they are written. Calculus is alive and moving forward--it needs to be taught\nthat way.\nOne new part of the subject has come with the computer. It works with a finite step\nh, not an \"infinitesimal\" limit. What it can do, it does quickly--even if it\ncannot find exact slopes or areas. The result is an overwhelming growth in the range\nof problems that can be solved. We landed on the moon because f and v were so\naccurate. (The moon's orbit has sines and cosines, the spacecraft starts with v D at\nand f D 1\n2at2: Only the computer can account for the atmosphere and the sun's\ngravity and the changing mass of the spacecraft.) Modern mathematics is a\ncombination of exact formulas and approximate computations. Neither part can be\nignored, and I hope you will see numerically what we derive algebraically. The\nexercises are to help you master both parts.\nThe course has made a quick start--not with an abstract discussion of sets or\nfunctions or limits, but with the concrete questions that led to those ideas. You have\nseen a distance function f and a limit v of average velocities. We will meet more\nfunctions and more limits (and their definitions!) but it is crucial to study important\nexamples early. There is a lot to do, but the course has definitely begun.\n1.4\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nA ball at angle t on the unit circle has coordinates x D\na\nand y D\nb\n.

The American League decided mathematically that there is\nalways a stop between backward and forward motion, even if the\ntime is too short to see it. (Therefore no balk.) Is that true ?\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\n1.5 A Review of Trigonometry\nTrigonometry begins with a right triangle. The size of the triangle is not as important\nas the angles. We focus on one particular angle--call it --and on the ratios between\nthe three sides x;y;r: The ratios don't change if the triangle is scaled to another size.\nThree sides give six ratios, which are the basic functions of trigonometry:\nFig. 1.19\ncos D x\nr D\nnear side\nhypotenuse\nsec D r\nx D\ncos\nsin D y\nr D opposite side\nhypotenuse\ncsc D r\ny D\nsin\ntan D y\nx D opposite side\nnear side\ncot D x\ny D\ntan\nOf course those six ratios are not independent. The three on the right come directly\nfrom the three on the left. And the tangent is the sine divided by the cosine:\ntan D sin\ncos D y=r\nx=r D y\nx :\nNote that \"tangent of an angle\" and \"tangent to a circle\" and \"tangent line to a graph\"\nare different uses of the same word. As the cosine of goes to zero, the tangent of\ngoes to infinity. The side x becomes zero, approaches 90\n; and the triangle is\ninfinitely steep. The sine of 90\nis y=r D 1:\nTriangles have a serious limitation. They are excellent for angles up to 90\n; and\nthey are OK up to 180\n; but after that they fail. We cannot put a 240\nangle into a\ntriangle. Therefore we change now to a circle.\nFig. 1.20\nTrigonometry on a circle.Compare 2sin with sin 2 and tan (periods 2;;).\nAngles are measured from the positive x axis (counterclockwise). Thus 90\nis\nstraight up, 180\nis to the left, and 360\nis in the same direction as 0\n: (Then 450\nis\nthe same as 90\n:) Each angle yields a point on the circle of radius r: The coordinates x\nand y of that point can be negative (but never r). As the point goes around the circle,\nthe six ratios cos ; sin ; tan ; ::: trace out six graphs. The cosine waveform is the\nsame as the sine waveform--just shifted by 90\n:\nOne more change comes with the move to a circle. Degrees are out. Radians are\nin. The distance around the whole circle is 2r: The distance around to other points\nis r: We measure the angle by that multiple . For a half-circle the distance is r,\n\n1.5\nA Review of Trigonometry\nso the angle is radians--which is 180\n: A quarter-circle is =2 radians or 90\n: The\ndistance around to angle is r times .\nWhen r D 1 this is the ultimate in simplicity: The distance is : A 45\nangle is 1\n8 of a\ncircle and 2=8 radians--and the length of the circular arc is 2=8: Similarly for 1\n:\nD 2 radians\nD 2=360 radians\n1 radian D 360=2 degrees.\nAn angle going clockwise is negative. The angle\n=3 is\nand takes us 1\n6 of the\nwrong way around the circle. What is the effect on the six functions?\nCertainly the radius r is not changed when we go to\n: Also x is not changed (see\nFigure 1.20a). But y reverses sign, because\nis below the axis when C is above.\nThis change in y affects y=r and y=x but not x=r:\ncos. / D cos\nsin . / D\nsin\ntan . / D\ntan :\nThe cosine is even (no change). The sine and tangent are odd (change sign).\nThe same point is 5\n6 of the right way around. Therefore 5\n6 of 2 radians (or 300\n)\ngives the same direction as\n=3 radians or\n: A difference of 2 makes no\ndifference to x;y;r. Thus sin and cos and the other four functions have period\n2: We can go five times or a hundred times around the circle, adding 10 or 200\nto the angle, and the six functions repeat themselves.\nEXAMPLE Evaluate the six trigonometric functions at D 2=3 (or D\n4=3).\nThis angle is shown in Figure 1.20a (where r D 1). The ratios are\ncos Dx=r D\n1=2\nsin Dy=r D\n?\n3=2\ntan Dy=x D\n\n?\nsec D\ncsc D2=\n?\ncot D\n1=\n?\nThose numbers illustrate basic facts about the sizes of four functions:\n|cos\n|\n¤ 1\n|sin\n|\n¤ 1\n|sec\n|\n¥ 1\n|csc\n|\n¥ 1:\nThe tangent and cotangent can fall anywhere, as long as cot D 1=tan :\nThe numbers reveal more. The tangent\n\n?\n3 is the ratio of sine to cosine. The\nsecant\n2 is 1=cos : Their squares are 3 and 4 (differing by 1). That may not seem\nremarkable, but it is. There are three relationships in the squares of those six numbers,\nand they are the key identities of trigonometry:\ncos2 Csin2 D 1\n1Ctan2 D sec2\ncot2 C1 D csc2\nEverything flows from the Pythagoras formula x2 Cy2 D r2: Dividing by r2 gives\n.x=r/2 C.y=r/2 D 1: That is cos2 Csin2 D 1: Dividing by x2 gives the second\nidentity, which is 1C.y=x/2 D .r=x/2: Dividing by y2 gives the third. All three will\nbe needed throughout the book--and the first one has to be unforgettable.\nDISTANCES AND ADDITION FORMULAS\nTo compute the distance between points we stay with Pythagoras. The points are in\nFigure 1.21a. They are known by their x and y coordinates, and d is the distance\nbetween them. The third point completes a right triangle.\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nFor the x distance along the bottom we don't need help. It is x2\nx1 (or\n|x2\nx1\n|\nsince distances can't be negative). The distance up the side is\n|y2\ny1\n|: Pythagoras\nimmediately gives the distance d:\ndistance between points D d D\na\n.x2\nx1/2 C.y2\ny1/2:\n(1)\nFig. 1.21\nDistance between points and equal distances in two circles.\nBy applying this distance formula in two identical circles, we discover the cosine\nof s\nt: (Subtracting angles is important.)

In the special case s D t, we have cos.t Ct/ D .cos t/.cos t/\n\n.sin t/.sin t/: This is a much-used formula for cos 2t :\nDouble angle: cos 2t D cos2t\nsin2t D 2cos2t\n1 D 1\n2sin2t:\n(6)\nI am constantly using cos2t Csin2t D 1, to switch between sines and cosines.\nWe also need addition formulas and double-angle formulas for the sine of s\nt and\ns Ct and 2t: For that we connect sine to cosine, rather than .sin e/2 to .cosine/2: The\n\n1.5\nA Review of Trigonometry\nconnection goes back to the ratio y=r in our original triangle. This is the sine of the\nangle and also the cosine of the complementary angle =2\n:\nsin D cos.=2\n/\nand\ncos D sin.=2\n/:\n(7)\nThe complementary angle is =2\nbecause the two angles add to =2 (a\nright angle).

Trigonometry is\nfull of identities that connect its six functions--basically because all those functions\ncome from a single right triangle. The x;y;r ratios and the equation x2 Cy2 D r2\ncan be rewritten in many ways. But you have now seen the formulas that are needed\nby ca1culus. They give derivatives in Chapter 2 and integrals in Chapter 5: And\nit is typical of our subject to add something of its own--a limit in which an angle\napproaches zero.

By the time it reaches\nx D 10;000, the curve has gone up and down 10;000=2 times. Those 1591\noscillations would be so crowded that you couldn't see anything. The graph of sin n\nhas picked 10;000 points from the curve--and for some reason those points seem to\nlie on more than 40 separate sine curves.\nThe second graph shows the first 1000 points. They don't seem to lie on sine curves.\nMost people see hexagons. But they are the same thousand points! It is hard to believe\nthat the graphs are the same, but I have learned what to do. Tilt the second graph and\nlook from the side at a narrow angle. Now the first graph appears. I believe you will\nsee \"diamonds.\" The narrow angle compresses the x axis--back to the scale of the\nfirst graph.\nThe effect of scale is something we don't think of. We understand it for maps.\nComputers can zoom in or zoom out--those are changes of scale. What our eyes see\ndepends on what is \"close.\" We think we see sine curves in the 10;000 point graph,\nand they raise several questions:\n1. Which points are near .0;0/ ?\n2. How many sine curves are there ?\n3. Where does the middle curve, going upward from .0;0/, come back to zero?\nA point near .0;0/ really means that sin n is close to zero. That is certainly not true\nof sin 1 (1 is one radian!). In fact sin 1 is up the axis at :84; at the start of the seventh\nsine curve. Similarly sin 2 is :91 and sin 3 is :14: (The numbers 3 and :14 make us\nthink of : The sine of 3 equals the sine of\n3: Then sin :14 is near :14:) Similarly\nsin 4; sin 5; ..., sin 21 are not especially close to zero.\nThe first point to come close is sin 22: This is because 22=7 is near : Then 22 is\nclose to 7, whose sine is zero:\nsin 22 D sin.7\n22/\nsin.:01/\n\n:01:\nThat is the first point to the right of .0;0/ and slightly below. You can see it on\ngraph 1; and more clearly on graph 2: It begins a curve downward.\nThe next point to come close is sin 44: This is because 44 is just past 14:\n14 C:02\nso\nsin 44\nsin :02\n:02:\nThis point .44; sin 44/ starts the middle sine curve. Next is .88; sin 88/:\n\nIntroduction to Calculus\nNow we know something. There are 44 curves. They begin near the heights sin 0;\nsin 1; :::;sin 43: Of these 44 curves, 22 start upward and 22 start downward. I was\nconfused at first, because I could only find 42 curves. The reason is that sin 11 equals\n0:99999 and sin 33 equals .9999: Those are so close to the bottom and top that\nyou can't see their curves. The sine of 11 is near\n1 because sin 22 is near zero. It is\nalmost impossible to follow a single curve past the top--coming back down it is not\nthe curve you think it is.\nThe points on the middle curve are at n D 0 and 44 and 88 and every number 44N:\nWhere does that curve come back to zero ? In other words, when does 44N come\nvery close to a multiple of ? We know that 44 is 14 C:02: More exactly 44 is\n14 C:0177: So we multiply :0177 until we reach :\nif N D =:0177\nthen\n44N D .14 C:0177/N D 14N C:\nThis gives N D 177:5: At that point 44N D 7810: This is half the period of the sine\ncurve. The sine of 7810 is very near zero.\nIf you follow the middle sine curve, you will see it come back to zero above 7810:\nThe actual points on that curve have n D 44\n177 and n D 44\n178, with sines just\nabove and below zero. Halfway between is n D 7810: The equation for the middle\nsine curve is y D sin.x=7810/. Its period is 15;620--beyond our graph.\nQuestion The fourth point on that middle curve looks the same as the fourth point\ncoming down from sin 3: What is this \"double point? \"\nAnswer 4 times 44 is 176: On the curve going up, the point is .176;sin 176/: On the\ncurve coming down it is .179;sin 179/: The sines of 176 and 179 differ only by\n.00003:\nThe second graph spreads out this double point. Look above 176 and 179; at the\ncenter of a hexagon. You can follow the sine curve all the way across graph 2:\nOnly a little question remains. Why does graph 2 have hexagons? I don't know.\nThe problem is with your eyes. To understand the hexagons, Doug Hardin plotted\npoints on straight lines as well as sine curves. Graph 3 shows y D fractional part of\nn=2: Then he made a second copy, turned it over, and placed it on top. That produced\ngraph 4--with hexagons. Graphs 3 and 4 are on the next page.\nThis is called a Moire pattern. If you can get a transparent copy of graph 3; and\nturn it slowly over the original, you will see fantastic hexagons. They come from\ninterference between periodic patterns--in our case 44=7 and 25=4 and 19=3 are near\n2: This interference is an enemy of printers, when color screens don't line up. It can\ncause vertical lines on a TV. Also in making cloth, operators get dizzy from seeing\nMoire patterns move. There are good applications in engineering and optics--but\nwe have to get back to calculus.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Calculus\nGilbert Strang\nThe following may not correspond to a particular course on MIT OpenCourseWare, but has been\nprovided by the author as an individual learning resource.\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Calculus\nGilbert Strang\nThe following may not correspond to a particular course on MIT OpenCourseWare, but has been\nprovided by the author as an individual learning resource.\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "CHAPTER 2\nDerivatives\n2.1 The Derivative of a Function\nThis chapter begins with the definition of the derivative. Two examples were in\nChapter 1: When the distance is t2, the velocity is 2t: When f .t/ D sin t we found\nv.t/ D cos t: The velocity is now called the derivative of f .t/: As we move to a\nmore formal definition and new examples, we use new symbols f\n1 and df=dt for the\nderivative.\n2A At time t, the derivative f\n1.t/ or df=dt or v.t/ is\nf\n1.t/ D lim\nt\nN0\nf .t Ct/\nf .t/\nt\n:\n(1)\nThe ratio on the right is the average velocity over a short time t: The derivative, on\nthe left side, is its limit as the step t (delta t) approaches zero.\nGo slowly and look at each piece. The distance at time t Ct is f .t Ct/: The\ndistance at time t is f .t/: Subtraction gives the change in distance, between those\ntimes. We often write f for this difference: f D f .t Ct/\nf .t/: The average\nvelocity is the ratio f=t--change in distance divided by change in time.\nThe limit of the average velocity is the derivative, if this limit exists:\ndf\ndt D lim\nt\nN0\nf\nt :\n(2)\nThis is the neat notation that Leibniz invented: f=t approaches df=dt: Behind\nthe innocent word \"limit\" is a process that this course will help you understand.\nNote that f is not times f ! It is the change in f: Similarly t is not\ntimes t: It is the time step, positive or negative and eventually small. To have a\none-letter symbol we replace t by h:\nThe right sides of (1) and (2) contain average speeds. On the graph of f .t/, the\ndistance up is divided by the distance across. That gives the average slope f=t:\nThe left sides of (1) and (2) are instantaneous speeds df=dt: They give the slope\nat the instant t: This is the derivative df=dt (when t and f shrink to zero). Look\nagain at the calculation for f .t/ D t2:\n\nDerivatives\nf\nt D f .t Ct/\nf .t/\nt\nD t2 C2t t C.t/2\nt2\nt\nD 2t Ct:\n(3)\nImportant point: Those steps are taken before t goes to zero. If we set t D 0 too\nsoon, we learn nothing. The ratio f=t becomes 0=0 (which is meaningless).\nThe numbers f and t must approach zero together, not separately. Here their\nratio is 2t Ct, the average speed.\nTo repeat: Success came by writing out .t Ct/2 and subtracting t2 and dividing\nby t: Then and only then can we approach t D 0: The limit is the derivative 2t:\nThere are several new things in formulas (1) and (2). Some are easy but important,\nothers are more profound. The idea of a function we will come back to, and the\ndefinition of a limit. But the notations can be discussed right away. They are used\nconstantly and you also need to know how to read them aloud:\nf .t/ D \"f of t\" D the value of the function f at time t\nt D \"delta t\" D the time step forward or backward from t\nf .t Ct/ D \"f of t plus delta t\" D the value of f at time t Ct\nf = \"delta f \" D the change f .t Ct/\nf .t/\nf=t D \"delta f over delta t\" D the average velocity\nf\n1.t/ D \"f prime of t\" D the value of the derivative at time t\ndf=dt D \"d f d t\" D the same as f\n1 (the instantaneous velocity)\nlim\nN0 D \"limit as delta t goes to zero\" D the process that starts with\nnumbers f=t and produces the number df=dt:\nFrom those last words you see what lies behind the notation df=dt: The symbol t\nindicates a nonzero (usually short) length of time. The symbol dt indicates\nan infinitesimal (even shorter) length of time. Some mathematicians work separately\nwith df and dt, and df=dt is their ratio. For us df=dt is a single notation (don't\ncancel d and don't cancel ). The derivative df=dt is the limit of f=t: When\nthat notation df=dt is awkward, use f\n1 or v:\nRemark\nThe notation hides one thing we should mention. The time step can be\nnegative just as easily as positive. We can compute the average f=t over a time\ninterval before the time t, instead of after. This ratio also approaches df=dt:\nThe notation also hides another thing: The derivative might not exist. The\naverages f=t might not approach a limit (it has to be the same limit going forward\nand backward from time t). In that case f\n1.t/ is not defined. At that instant there is\nno clear reading on the speedometer. This will happen in Example 2.\nEXAMPLE 1\n(Constant velocity V D 2) The distance f is V times t: The distance\nat time t Ct is V times t Ct: The difference f is V times t:\nf\nt D Vt\nt D V\nso the limit is\ndf\ndt D V:\nThe derivative of V t is V: The derivative of 2t is 2: The averages f=t are always\nV D 2, in this exceptional case of a constant velocity.\n\n2.1\nThe Derivative of a Function\nEXAMPLE 2\nConstant velocity 2 up to time t D 3, then stop.\nFor small times we still have f .t/ D 2t: But after the stopping time, the distance\nis fixed at f .t/ D 6: The graph is flat beyond time 3. Then f .t Ct/ D f .t/ and\nf D 0 and the derivative of a constant function is zero:\nt\n¡ 3W\nf\n1.t/ D lim\nt\nN0\nf .t Ct/\nf .t/\nt\nD lim\nt\nN0\nt D 0:\n(4)\nIn this example the derivative is not defined at the instant when t D 3. The velocity\nfalls suddenly from 2 to zero. The ratio f=t depends, at that special moment, on\nwhether t is positive or negative. The average velocity after time t D 3 is zero. The\naverage velocity before that time is 2: When the graph of f has a corner, the graph\nof v has a jump. It is a step function.\nOne new part of that example is the notation (df=dt or f\n1 instead of v). Please\nlook also at the third figure. It shows how the function takes t (on the left) to f .t/:\nEspecially it shows t and f: At the start, f=t is 2. After the stop at t D 3, all\nt's go to the same f .t/ D 6: So f D 0 and df=dt D 0:\nFig. 2.1\nThe derivative is 2 then 0: It does not exist at t D 3:\nTHE DERIVATIVE OF 1=t\nHere is a completely different slope, for the \"demand function\" f .t/ D 1=t:\nThe demand is 1=t when the price is t: A high price t means a low demand 1=t:\nIncreasing the price reduces the demand. The calculus question is: How quickly\ndoes 1=t change when t changes ? The \"marginal demand\" is the slope of the\ndemand curve.\nThe big thing is to find the derivative of 1=t once and for all. It is\n1=t2:\nEXAMPLE 3\nf .t/ D 1\nt has f D\nt Ct\nt : This equals t\n.t Ct/\nt.t Ct/ D\nt\nt.t Ct/:\nDivide by t and let t\nN 0 W f\nt D\nt.t Ct/ approaches df\ndt D\nt2 :\nLine 1 is algebra, line 2 is calculus. The first step in line 1 subtracts f .t/ from\nf .t Ct/: The difference is 1=.t Ct/ minus 1=t: The common denominator is t\ntimes t Ct--this makes the algebra possible. We can't set t D 0 in line 2; until\nwe have divided by t:\nThe average is f=t D\n1=t.t Ct/: Now set t D 0: The derivative is\n1=t2:\nSection 2:4 will discuss the first of many cases when substituting t D 0 is not\npossible, and the idea of a limit has to be made clearer.\n\nDerivatives\nFig. 2.2\nAverage slope is\n6, true slope is\n4: Increase in t produces decrease in f:\nCheck the algebra at t D 2 and t Ct D 3: The demand 1=t drops from 1=2 to\n1=3: The difference is f D\n1=6, which agrees with\n1=.2/.3/ in line 1. As the\nsteps f and t get smaller, their ratio approaches\n1=.2/.2/ D\n1=4:\nThis derivative is negative. The function 1=t is decreasing, and f is below\nzero. The graph is going downward in Figure 2.2, and its slope is negative:\nAn increasing f .t/ has positive slope.\nA decreasing f .t/ has negative slope.\nThe slope\n1=t2 is very negative for small t: A price increase severely cuts demand.\nThe next figure makes a small but important point. There is nothing sacred about t:\nOther letters can be used--especially x: A quantity can depend on position instead\nof time. The height changes as we go west. The area of a square changes as the side\nchanges. Those are not affected by the passage of time, and there is no reason to use\nt: You will often see y D f .x/, with x across and y up--connected by a function f:\nSimilarly, f is not the only possibility. Not every function is named f ! That letter\nis useful because it stands for the word function--but we are perfectly entitled to write\ny.x/ or y.t/ instead of f .x/ or f .t/: The distance up is a function of the distance\nacross. This relationship \"y of x\" is all-important to mathematics.\nThe slope is also a function. Calculus is about two functions, y.x/ and dy=dx:\nQuestion If we add 1 to y.x/, what happens to the slope ? Answer Nothing.\nQuestion If we add 1 to the slope, what happens to the height ? Answer\n:\nThe symbols t and x represent independent variables--they take any value they\nwant to (in the domain). Once they are set, f .t/ and y.x/ are determined. Thus f and\ny represent dependent variables--they depend on t and x: A change t produces a\nFig. 2.3\nThe derivative of 1=t is\n1=t2: The slope of 1=x is\n1=x2:\n\n2.1\nThe Derivative of a Function\nchange f: A change x produces y: The independent variable goes inside the\nparentheses in f .t/ and y.x/: It is not the letter that matters, it is the idea:\nindependent variable t or x\ndependent variable f or g or y or z or u\nderivative df=dt or df=dx or dy=dx or\n\nThe derivative dy=dx comes from [change in y] divided by [change in x]. The time\nstep becomes a space step, forward or backward. The slope is the rate at which y\nchanges with x: The derivative of a function is its \"rate of change.\"\nI mention that physics books use x.t/ for distance. Darn it.\nTo emphasize the definition of a derivative, here it is again with y and x:\ny\nx D y.x Cx/\ny.x/\nx\nD\ndistance up\ndistance across\ndy\ndx D lim\nx\nN0\ny\nx D y\n1.x/:\nThe notation y\n1.x/ pins down the point x where the slope is computed. In dy=dx that\nextra precision is omitted. This book will try for a reasonable compromise between\nlogical perfection and ordinary simplicity. The notation dy=dx.x/ is not good; y\n1.x/\nis better; when x is understood it need not be written in parentheses.\nYou are allowed to say that the function is y D x2 and the derivative is y\n1 D 2x--\neven if the strict notation requires y.x/ D x2 and y\n1.x/ D 2x: You can even say that\nthe function is x2 and its derivative is 2x and its second derivative is 2--provided\neverybody knows what you mean.\nHere is an example. It is a little early and optional but terrific. You get excellent\npractice with letters and symbols, and out come new derivatives.\nEXAMPLE 4\nIf u.x/ has slope du=dx, what is the slope of f .x/ D .u.x//2 ?\nFrom the derivative of x2 this will give the derivative of x4: In that case u D x2\nand f D x4: First point: The derivative of u2 is not .du=dx/2. We do not square\nthe derivative 2x: To find the \"square rule\" we start as we have to--with\nf D f .x Cx/\nf .x/:\nf D .u.x Cx//2\n.u.x//2 D Œu.x Cx/Cu.x/Œu.x Cx/\nu.x/:\nThis algebra puts f in a convenient form. We factored a2\nb2 into ŒaCb times\nŒa\nb: Notice that we don't have .u/2: We have f , the change in u2: Now\ndivide by x and take the limit:\nf\nx D Œu.x Cx/Cu.x/\nu.x Cx/\nu.x/\nx\n\napproaches 2u.x/du\ndx :\n(5)\nThis is the square rule: The derivative of .u.x//2 is 2u.x/ times du=dx. From the\nderivatives of x2 and 1=x and sin x (all known) the examples give new derivatives.\nEXAMPLE 5\n.u D x2/ The derivative of x4 is 2u du=dx D 2.x2/.2x/ D 4x3:\nEXAMPLE 6\n.u D 1=x/ The derivative of 1=x2 is 2u du=dx D .2=x/. 1=x2/ D\n2=x3:\nEXAMPLE 7\n.u D sin x; du=dx D cos x/ The derivative of u2 D sin2x is 2sin x cos x:\nMathematics is really about ideas. The notation is created to express those ideas.\nNewton and Leibniz invented calculus independently, and Newton's friends spent\n\nDerivatives\na lot of time proving that he was first. He was, but it was Leibniz who thought of\nwriting dy=dx--which caught on. It is the perfect way to suggest the limit of y=x:\nNewton was one of the great scientists of all time, and calculus was one of the great\ninventions of all time-but the notation must help. You now can write and speak about\nthe derivative. What is needed is a longer list of functions and derivatives.\n2.1\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe derivative is the\na\nof f =t as t approaches\nb\n.\nHere f equals\nc\n.

One is to find the derivatives of f .x/ D x3 and\nx4 and x5 (and more generally f .x/ D xn). The power or exponent n is at first a\npositive integer. Later we allow x and x2:2 and every xn:\nThe other goal is different. While computing these derivatives, we look ahead to\ntheir applications. In using calculus, we meet equations with derivatives in them--\n\"differential equations.\" It is too early to solve those equations. But it is not too\nearly to see the purpose of what we are doing. Our examples come from economics\nand biology.\nWith n D 2, the derivative of x2 is 2x: With n D\n1, the slope of x\n1 is\n1x\n2:\nThose are two pieces in a beautiful pattern, which it will be a pleasure to discover. We\nbegin with x3 and its derivative 3x2, before jumping to xn:\nEXAMPLE 1\nIf f .x/ D x3 then f D .x Ch/3\nx3 D .x3 C3x2hC3xh2 Ch3/\nx3:\nStep 1: Cancel x3:\nStep 2: Divide by h:\nStep 3: h goes to zero.\nf\nh D 3x2 C3xhCh2\napproaches\ndf\ndx D 3x2:\nThat is straightforward, and you see the crucial step. The power .x Ch/3 yields four\nseparate terms x3 C3x2hC3xh2 Ch3: (Notice 1, 3, 3, 1:) After x3 is subtracted,\nwe can divide by h: At the limit .h D 0/ we have 3x2:\nFor f .x/ D xn the plan is the same. A step of size h leads to f .x Ch/ D .x Ch/n:\nOne reason for algebra is to calculate powers like .x Ch/n, and if you have forgotten\nthe binomial formula we can recapture its main point. Start with n D 4:\n.x Ch/.x Ch/.x Ch/.x Ch/ D x4C\n‹‹‹\nCh4:\n(1)\nMultiplying the four x's gives x4: Multiplying the four h's gives h4: These are the\neasy terms, but not the crucial ones. The subtraction .x Ch/4\nx4 will remove x4,\nand the limiting step h\nN 0 will wipe out h4 (even after division by h). The products\nthat matter are those with exactly one h. In Example 1 with .x Ch/3, this key term\nwas 3x2h: Division by h left 3x2:\nWith only one h, there are n places it can come from.

The complete binomial formula is in Section 10:5:\nThat list is a good start, but plenty of functions are left. What comes next is really\nsimple. A tremendous number of new functions are \"linear combinations\" like\nf .x/ D 6x3\nor\n6x3 C 1\n2x2\nor\n6x3\n2x2:\n\nDerivatives\nWhat are their derivatives? The answers are known for x3 and x2, and we want to\nmultiply by 6 or divide by 2 or add or subtract. Do the same to the derivatives:\nf\n1.x/ D 18x2\nor\n18x2 Cx\nor\n18x2\nx:\n2C The derivative of c times f .x/ is c times f\n1.x/:\n2D The derivative of f .x/Cg.x/ is f\n1.x/Cg\n1.x/:\nThe number c can be any constant. We can add (or subtract) any functions.\nThe rules allow any combination of f and g: The derivative of 9f .x/\n7g.x/\nis 9f\n1.x/\n7g\n1.x/:\nThe reasoning is direct. When f .x/ is multiplied by c, so is f .x Ch/: The\ndifference f is also multiplied by c: All averages f=h contain c, so their limit is\ncf\n1: The only incomplete step is the last one (the limit). We still have to say what\n\"limit\" means.\nRule 2D is similar. Adding f Cg means adding f Cg: Now divide by h: In\nthe limit as h\nN 0 we reach f\n1 Cg\n1--because a limit of sums is a sum of limits.\nAny example is easy and so is the proof--it is the definition of limit that needs care\n(Section 2:6).\nYou can now find the derivative of every polynomial. A \"polynomial\" is a\ncombination of 1; x; x2; :::; xn--for\nexample 9C2x\nx5:\nThat\nparticular\npolynomial has slope 2\n5x4: Note that the derivative of 9 is zero! A constant just\nraises or lowers the graph, without changing its slope. It alters the mileage before\nstarting the car.\nThe disappearance of constants is one of the nice things in differential calculus. The\nreappearance of those constants is one of the headaches in integral calculus. When you\nfind v from f , the starting mileage doesn't matter. The constant in f has no effect on\nv: (f is measured by a trip meter; t comes from a stopwatch.) To find distance\nfrom velocity, you need to know the mileage at the start.\nA LOOK AT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (FIND y FROM dy=dx)\nWe know that y D x3 has the derivative dy=dx D 3x2: Starting with the function,\nwe found its slope. Now reverse that process. Start with the slope and find the\nfunction. This is what science does all the time--and it seems only reasonable to say\nso.\nBegin with dy=dx D 3x2: The slope is given, the function y is not given.\nQuestion Can you go backward to reach y D x3 ?\nAnswer\nAlmost but not quite. You are only entitled to say that y D x3 CC: The\nconstant C is the starting value of y (when x D 0). Then the differential equation\ndy=dx D 3x2 is solved.\nEvery time you find a derivative, you can go backward to solve a differential\nequation. The function y D x2 Cx has the slope dy=dx D 2x C1: In reverse, the\nslope 2x C1 produces x2 Cx--and all the other functions x2 Cx CC , shifted up\nand down. After going from distance f to velocity v, we return to f CC: But there\nis a lot more to differential equations. Here are two crucial points:\n1. We reach dy=dx by way of y=x, but we have no system to go backward.\nWith dy=dx D .sin x/=x we are lost. What function has this derivative?\n\n2.2\nPowers and Polynomials\n2. Many equations have the same solution y D x3: Economics has dy=dx D 3y=x:\nGeometry has dy=dx D 3y2=3: These equations involve y as well as dy=dx:\nFunction and slope are mixed together! This is typical of differential equations.\nTo summarize: Chapters 2-4 compute and use derivatives. Chapter 5 goes in reverse.\nIntegral calculus discovers the function from its slope. Given dy=dx we find y.x/:\nThen Chapter 6 solves the differential equation dy=dt D y, function mixed with slope.\nCalculus moves from derivatives to integrals to differential equations.\nThis discussion of the purpose of calculus should mention a specific example. Dif-\nferential equations are applied to an epidemic (like AIDS). In most epidemics the\nnumber of cases grows exponentially. The peak is quickly reached by et, and the epi-\ndemic dies down. Amazingly, exponential growth is not happening with AIDS--the\nbest fit to the data through 1988 is a cubic polynomial (Los Alamos Science, 1989):\nThe number of cases fits a cubic within 2% W y D 174:6.t\n1981:2/3C340:\nThis is dramatically different from other epidemics. Instead of dy=dt D y we have\ndy=dt D 3y=t: Before this book is printed, we may know what has been\npreventing et (fortunately). Eventually the curve will turn away from a cubic--I hope\nthat mathematical models will lead to knowledge that saves lives.\nAdded in proof: In 1989 the curve for the U.S. dropped from t3 to t2:\nMARGINAL COST AND ELASTICITY IN ECONOMICS\nFirst point about economics: The marginal cost and marginal income are crucially\nimportant. The average cost of making automobiles may be $10;000: But it is the\n$8;000 cost of the next car that decides whether Ford makes it. \"The average\ndescribes the past, the marginal predicts the future.\" For bank deposits or work\nhours or wheat, which come in smaller units, the amounts are continuous variables.\nThen the word \"marginal\" says one thing: Take the derivative.\nThe average pay over all the hours we ever worked may be low. We wouldn't work\nanother hour for that! This average is rising, but the pay for each additional hour rises\nfaster--possibly it jumps. When $10=hour increases to $15=hour after a 40-hour\nweek, a 50-hour week pays $550: The average income is $11=hour. The marginal\nincome is $15=hour--the overtime rate.\nConcentrate next on cost. Let y.x/ be the cost of producing x tons of steel. The\ncost of x Cx tons is y.x Cx/: The extra cost is the difference y: Divide by\nx, the number of extra tons. The ratio y=x is the average cost per extra ton.\nWhen x is an ounce instead of a ton, we are near the marginal cost dy=dx:\nExample: When the cost is x2, the average cost is x2=x D x: The marginal cost is\n2x: Figure 2.4 has increasing slope--an example of \"diminishing returns to scale.\"\nThis raises another point about economics. The units are arbitrary. In yen per\nkilogram the numbers look different. The way to correct for arbitrary units is to work\nwith percentage change or relative change. An increase of x tons is a relative\nincrease of x=x: A cost increase y is a relative increase of y=y: Those are\ndimensionless, the same in tons=tons or dollars=dollars or yen=yen.\nA third example is the demand y at price x. Now dy=dx is negative. But again\nthe units are arbitrary. The demand is in liters or gallons, the price is in dollars or\npesos.\nThese paragraphs show how calculus applies to economics. You do not have to be an\neconomist to understand them. Certainly the author is not, probably the instructor is not,\npossibly the student is not. We can all use dy=dx:\n\nDerivatives\nFig. 2.4\nMarginal exceeds average. Constant elasticity E D\n1: Perfectly elastic to perfectly\ninelastic ( curve).\nRelative changes are better. When the price goes up by 10%, the demand may drop\nby 5%: If that ratio stays the same for small increases, the elasticity of demand is 1\n2:\nActually this number should be\n2: The price rose, the demand dropped. In our\ndefinition, the elasticity will be\n2: In conversation between economists the minus\nsign is left out (I hope not forgotten).\nDEFINITION\nThe elasticity of the demand function y.x/ is\nE.x/ D lim\nx\nN0\ny=y\nx=x D dy=dx\ny=x :\n(3)\nElasticity is \"marginal\" divided by \"average.\" E.x/ is also relative change in y\ndivided by relative change in x: Sometimes E.x/ is the same at all prices--this\nimportant case is discussed below.\nEXAMPLE 4\nSuppose the demand is y D c=x when the price is x: The derivative\ndy=dx D\nc=x2 comes from calculus. The division y=x D c=x2 is only algebra.\nThe ratio is E D\n1:\nFor the demand y D c=x, the elasticity is . c=x2/=.c=x2/ D\n1:\nAll demand curves are compared with this one. The demand is inelastic when\n|E\n|\n1: It is elastic when\n|E\n|\n¡ 1: The demand 20=\n?x is inelastic .E D\n2/,\nwhile x\n3 is elastic .E D\n3/: The power y D cxn, whose derivative we know, is\nthe function with constant elasticity n:\nif y D cxn then dy=dx D cnxn 1 and E D cnxn 1=.cxn=x/ D n:\nIt is because y D cxn sets the standard that we could come so early to economics.\nIn the special case when y D c=x, consumers spend the same at all prices. Price x\ntimes quantity y remains constant at xy D c:\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe supply curve has E\n¡ 0--supply increases with price. Now\nthe baseline case is y D cx: The slope is c and the average is y=x D c: The elasticity\nis E D c=c D 1:\nCompare E D 1 with E D 0 and E D\n8: A constant supply is \"perfectly inelastic.\"\nThe power n is zero and the slope is zero: y D c: No more is available when the\nharvest is over. Whatever the price, the farmer cannot suddenly grow more wheat.\nLack of elasticity makes farm economics difficult.\nThe other extreme E D\n8 is \"perfectly elastic.\" The supply is unlimited at a fixed\nprice x: Once this seemed true of water and timber. In reality the steep curve\n\n2.2\nPowers and Polynomials\nx D constant is leveling off to a flat curve y D constant. Fixed price is changing to\nfixed supply, E D\n8 is becoming E D 0, and the supply of water follows a \"gamma\ncurve\" shaped like :\nEXAMPLE 6\nDemand is an increasing function of income--more income, more\ndemand. The income elasticity is E.I/ D .dy=dI/=.y=I/: A luxury has E\n¡ 1\n(elastic). Doubling your income more than doubles the demand for caviar. A necessity\nhas E\n1 (inelastic). The demand for bread does not double. Please recognize how\nthe central ideas of calculus provide a language for the central ideas of economics.\nImportant note on supply D demand This is the basic equation of microeconomics.\nWhere the supply curve meets the demand curve, the economy finds the equilibrium\nprice. Supply D demand assumes perfect competition. With many suppliers, no one\ncan raise the price. If someone tries, the customers go elsewhere.\nThe opposite case is a monopoly--no competition. Instead of many small pro-\nducers of wheat, there is one producer of electricity. An airport is a monopolist (and\nmaybe the National Football League). If the price is raised, some demand remains.\nPrice fixing occurs when several producers act like a monopoly-which antitrust\nlaws try to prevent. The price is not set by supply D demand. The calculus problem is\ndifferent--to maximize profit. Section 3:2 locates the maximum where the marginal\nprofit (the slope!) is zero.\nQuestion on income elasticity\nFrom an income of $10;000 you save $500:\nThe income elasticity of savings is E D 2: Out of the next dollar what fraction do\nyou save ?\nAnswer\nThe savings is y D cx2 because E D 2: The number c must give 500 D\nc.10;000/2, so c is 5\n6: Then the slope dy=dx is 2cx D 10\n104 D\n10: This is the marginal savings, ten cents on the dollar. Average savings is 5%;\nmarginal savings is 10%; and E D 2.\n2.2\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe derivative of f D x4 is f\n1 D\na\n.

The velocity was constant (at least\npiecewise). The distance function was linear. Now we are facing polynomials like\nx3\n2 or x4\nx2 C3, with other functions to come soon. Their graphs are definitely\ncurved. Most functions are not close to linear--except if you focus all your attention\nnear a single point. That is what we will do.\nOver a very short range a curve looks straight. Look through a microscope, or\nzoom in with a computer, and there is no doubt. The graph of distance versus time\nbecomes nearly linear. Its slope is the velocity at that moment. We want to find the\nline that the graph stays closest to--the \"tangent line\"--before it curves away.\nThe tangent line is easy to describe. We are at a particular point on the graph of\ny D f .x/: At that point x equals a and y equals f .a/ and the slope equals f\n1.a/:\nThe tangent line goes through that point x D a;y D f .a/ with that slope\nm D f\n1.a/. Figure 2.5 shows the line more clearly than any equation, but we have to\nturn the geometry into algebra. We need the equation of the line.\nEXAMPLE 1\nSuppose y D x4\nx2 C3: At the point x D a D 1, the height is\ny D f .a/ D 3: The slope is dy=dx D 4x3\n2x: At x D 1 the slope is 4\n2 D 2:\nThat is f\n1.a/:\nThe numbers x D 1; y D 3; dy=dx D 2 determine the tangent line.\nThe equation of the tangent line is y\n3 D 2.x\n1/, and this section explains\nwhy.\nFig. 2.5\nThe tangent line has the same slope 2 as the curve (especially after zoom).\nTHE EQUATION OF A LINE\nA straight line is determined by two conditions. We know the line if we know two of\nits points. (We still have to write down the equation.) Also, if we know one point and\nthe slope, the line is set. That is the situation for the tangent line, which has a known\nslope at a known point:\n1. The equation of a line has the form y D mx Cb\n2. The number m is the slope of the line, because dy=dx D m\n3. The number b adjusts the line to go through the required point.\nI will take those one at a time--first y D mx Cb, then m, then b:\n\n2.3\nThe Slope and the Tangent Line\n1. The graph of y D mx Cb is not curved. How do we know? For the specific\nexample y D 2x C1, take two points whose coordinates x;y satisfy the equation:\nx D 0;y D 1\nand\nx D 4;y D 9\nboth satisfy\ny D 2x C1:\nThose points .0;1/ and .4;9/ lie on the graph. The point halfway between has x D 2\nand y D 5. That point also satisfies y D 2x C1: The halfway point is on the graph.\nIf we subdivide again, the midpoint between .0;1/ and .2;5/ is .1;3/: This also has\ny D 2x C1: The graph contains all halfway points and must be straight.\n2.\nWhat is the correct slope m for the tangent line ? In our example it is\nm D f\n1.a/ D 2:\nThe curve and its tangent line have the same slope at the crucial point:\ndy=dx D 2:\nAllow me to say in another way why the line y D mx Cb has slope m: At x D 0\nits height is y D b: At x D 1 its height is y D mCb: The graph has gone one unit\nacross .0 to 1/ and m units up .b to mCb/: The whole idea is\nslope D\ndistance up\ndistance across D m\n1 :\n(1)\nEach unit across means m units up, to 2mCb or 3mCb: A straight line keeps a\nconstant slope, whereas the slope of y D x4\nx2 C3 equals 2 only at x D 1:\n3. Finally we decide on b: The tangent line y D 2x Cb must go through x D 1;\ny D 3: Therefore b D 1: With letters instead of numbers, y D mx Cb leads to\nf .a/ D maCb: So we know b:\n2E The equation of the tangent line has b D f .a/\nma:\ny D mx Cf .a/\nma\nor\ny\nf .a/ D m.x\na/:\n(2)\nThat last form is the best. You see immediately what happens at x D a: The factor\nx\na is zero. Therefore y D f .a/ as required. This is the point-slope form of the\nequation, and we use it constantly:\ny\n3 D 2.x\n1/\nor\ny\nx\n1 D\ndistance up\ndistance across D slope 2:\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe curve y D x3\n2 goes through y D 6 when x D 2: At that point\ndy=dx D 3x2 D 12: Thepoint-slopeequation of the tangentline uses 2 and 6 and 12:\ny\n6 D 12.x\n2/\nwhich is also\ny D 12x\n18:\nThere is another important line. It is perpendicular to the tangent line and\nperpendicular to the curve. This is the normal line in Figure 2.6. Its new feature\nis its slope. When the tangent line has slope m, the normal line has slope\n1=m:\n(Rule: Slopes of perpendicular lines multiply to give\n1:) Example 2 has m D 12,\nso the normal line has slope\n1=12:\ntangent line: y\n6 D 12.x\n2/\nnormal line: y\n6 D\n12.x\n2/:\nLight rays travel in the normal direction. So do brush fires--they move perpendicular\nto the fire line. Use the point-slope form! The tangent is y D 12x\n18, the normal is\nnot y D\n12x\n18:\n\nDerivatives\nEXAMPLE 3\nYou are on a roller-coaster whose track follows y D x2 C4: You see\na friend at .0;0/ and want to get there quickly. Where do you step off ?\nSolution Your path will be the tangent line (at high speed). The problem is to choose\nx D a so the tangent line passes through x D 0;y D 0: When you step off at x D a,\nthe height is y D a2 C4 and the slope is 2a\nthe equation of the tangent line is y\n.a2C4/ D 2a.x\na/\nthis line goes through .0;0/ if\n.a2C4/ D\n2a2 or a D\n2:\nThe same problem is solved by spacecraft controllers and baseball pitchers. Releasing\na ball at the right time to hit a target 60 feet away is an amazing display of calculus.\nQuarterbacks with a moving target should read Chapter 4 on related rates.\nHere is a better example than a roller-coaster. Stopping at a red light wastes gas. It\nis smarter to slow down early, and then accelerate. When a car is waiting in front of\nyou, the timing needs calculus:\nEXAMPLE 4\nHow much must you slow down when a red light is 72 meters away ?\nIn 4 seconds it will be green. The waiting car will accelerate at 3 meters=sec2: You\ncannot pass the car.\nStrategy Slow down immediately to the speed V at which you will just catch that car.\n(If you wait and brake later, your speed will have to go below V:) At the catchup time\nT , the cars have the same speed and same distance. Two conditions, so the distance\nfunctions in Figure 2.6d are tangent.\nSolution\nAt time T , the other car's speed is 3.T\n4/: That shows the delay of 4\nseconds. Speeds are equal when 3.T\n4/ D V or T D 1\n3V C4: Now require equal\ndistances. Your distance is V times T: The other car's distance is 72C 1\n2at2:\n72C 1\n3.T\n4/2 D V T\nbecomes\n72C 1\n3V 2 D V\n3V C4\n\n:\nThe solution is V D 12 meters=second. This is 43 km=hr or 27 miles per hour.\nWithout the other car, you only slow down to V D 72=4 D 18 meters=second. As\nthe light turns green, you go through at 65 km=hr or 40 miles per hour. Try it.\nFig. 2.6\nTangent line y\ny0 D m.x\nx0/: Normal line y\ny0 D\nm.x\nx0/: Leaving a\nroller-coaster and catching up to a car.\n\n2.3\nThe Slope and the Tangent Line\nTHE SECANT LINE CONNECTING TWO POINTS ON A CURVE\nInstead of the tangent line through one point, consider the secant line through two\npoints. For the tangent line the points came together. Now spread them apart. The\npoint-slope form of a linear equation is replaced by the two-point form.\nThe equation of the curve is still y D f .x/: The first point remains at x D a;\ny D f .a/: The other point is at x D c;y D f .c/: The secant line goes between them,\nand we want its equation. This time we don't start with the slope--but m is easy to\nfind.\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe curve y D x3\n2 goes through x D 2;y D 6: It also goes through\nx D 3;y D 25: The slope between those points is\nm D change in y\nchange in x D 25\n2 D 19:\nThe point-slope form (at the first point) is y\n6 D 19.x\n2/: This line automatically\ngoes through the second point .3;25/: Check: 25\n6 equals 19.3\n2/: The secant\nhas the right slope 19 to reach the second point. It is the average slope y=x.\nA look ahead The second point is going to approach the first point. The secant\nslope y=x will approach the tangent slope dy=dx: We discover the derivative\n(in the limit). That is the main point now--but not forever.\nSoon you will be fast at derivatives. The exact dy=dx will be much easier\nthan y=x: The situation is turned around as soon as you know that x9 has slope\n9x8: Near x D 1, the distance up is about 9 times the distance across. To find\ny D 1:0019\n19, just multiply x D :001 by 9: The quick approximation is\n:009, the calculator gives y D :009036: It is easier to follow the tangent line than\nthe curve.\nCome back to the secant line, and change numbers to letters. What line connects\nx D a;y D f .a/ to x D c;y D f .c/ ? A mathematician puts formulas ahead of\nnumbers, and reasoning ahead of formulas, and ideas ahead of reasoning:\n(1) The slope is m D\ndistance up\ndistance across D f .c/\nf .a/\nc\na\n(2) The height is y D f .a/ at x D a\n(3) The height is y D f .c/ at x D c (automatic with correct slope).\n2F The two-point form uses the slope between the points:\nsecant line W\ny\nf .a/ D\nf .c/\nf .a/\nc\na\n\n.x\na/:\n(3)\nAt x D a the right side is zero. So y D f .a/ on the left side. At x D c the right\nside has two factors c\na: They cancel to leave y D f .c/: With equation (2) for the\ntangent line and equation (3) for the secant line, we are ready for the moment of truth.\n\nDerivatives\nTHE SECANT LINE APPROACHES THE TANGENT LINE\nWhat comes now is pretty basic. It matches what we did with velocities:\naverage velocityD distance\ntime\nD f .t Ct/\nf .t/\nt\n:\nThe limit is df=dt: We now do exactly the same thing with slopes.

You have to imagine\nmore secant lines than I can draw in Figure 2.7, as c comes close to a: Everybody\nrecognizes c\na as x: Do you recognize f .c/\nf .a/ as f .x Cx/\nf .x/ ? It\nis f , the change in height. All lines go through x D a;y D f .a/: Their limit is\nthe tangent line.\nFig. 2.7\nSecants approach tangent as their\nslopes f =x approach df =dx:\nsecant\ny\nf .a/ D f .c/\nf .a/\nc\na\n.x\na/\ntangent\ny\nf .a/ D f\n1.a/.x\na/\nIntuitively, the limit is pretty clear. The two points come together, and the\ntangent line touches the curve at one point. (It could touch again at faraway points.)\nMathematically this limit can be tricky--it takes us from algebra to calculus. Algebra\nstays away from 0=0, but calculus gets as close as it can.\nThe new limit for df=dx looks different, but it is the same as before:\nf\n1.a/ D lim\nc\nNa\nf .c/\nf .a/\nc\na\n:\n(4)\nEXAMPLE 6\nFind the secant lines and tangent line for y D f .x/ D sin x at x D 0:\nThe starting point is x D 0;y D sin 0: This is the origin .0;0/: The ratio of distance\nup to distance across is .sin c/=c:\nsecant equation\ny D sin c\nc\nx\ntangent equation\ny D 1x:\nAs c approaches zero, the secant line becomes the tangent line.

One is to compute the derivatives of sin x and cos x:\nThe other is to explain why these functions are so important. They describe\noscillation, which will be expressed in words and equations. You will see a\n\"differential equation.\" It involves the derivative of an unknown function y.x/:\nThe differential equation will say that the second derivative--the derivative of the\nderivative--is equal and opposite to y: In symbols this is y\n2 D\ny: Distance in one\ndirection leads to acceleration in the other direction. That makes y and y\n1 and y\n2 all\noscillate. The solutions to y\n2 D\ny are sin x and cos x and all their combinations.\nWe begin with the slope. The derivative of y D sin x is y\n1 D cos x: There is no\nreason for that to be a mystery, but I still find it beautiful. Chapter 1 followed a ball\naround a circle; the shadow went up and down. Its height was sin t and its velocity\nwas cos t: We now find that derivative by the standard method of limits, when\ny.x/ D sin x:\ndy\ndx D limit of y\nx D lim\nhN0\nsin.x Ch/\nsin x\nh\n:\n(1)\nThe sine is harder to work with than x2 or x3: Where we had .x Ch/2 or .x Ch/3,\nwe now have sin.x Ch/: This calls for one of the basic \"addition formulas\" from\ntrigonometry, reviewed in Section 1:5 W\nsin.x Ch/ D sin x cos hCcos x sin h\n(2)\ncos.x Ch/ D cos x cos h\nsin x sin h:\n(3)\nEquation (2) puts y D sin.x Ch/\nsin x in a new form:\ny\nx D sin x cos hCcos x sin h\nsin x\nh\nD sin x\ncos h\nh\n\nCcos x\nsin h\nh\n\n:\n(4)\nThe ratio splits into two simpler pieces on the right. Algebra and trigonometry got\nus this far, and now comes the calculus problem. What happens as h\nN 0 ? It is no\nlonger easy to divide by h: (I will not even mention the unspeakable crime of writing\n.sin h/=h D sin:) There are two critically important limits--the first is zero and the\nsecond is one:\nlim\nhN0\ncos h\nh\nD 0\nand\nlim\nhN0\nsin h\nh\nD 1:\n(5)\nThe careful reader will object that limits have not been defined! You may further\nobject to computing these limits separately, before combining them into equation (4).\nNevertheless--following the principle of ideas now, rigor later--I would like to\nproceed. It is entirely true that the limit of (4) comes from the two limits in (5):\ndy\ndx D .sin x/.first limit/C.cos x/.second limit/ D 0Ccos x:\n(6)\nThe secant slope y=x has approached the tangent slope dy=dx:\n2G The derivative of y D sin x is dy=dx D cos x:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nFig. 2.8\nWe cannot pass over the crucial step--the two limits in (5). They contain the real\nideas. Both ratios become 0=0 if we just substitute h D 0. Remember that the\ncosine of a zero angle is 1, and the sine of a zero angle is 0: Figure 2.8a shows a\nsmall angle h (as near to zero as we could reasonably draw). The edge of length sin h\nis close to zero, and the edge of length cos h is near 1: Figure 2.8b shows how the\nratio of sin h to h (both headed for zero) gives the slope of the sine curve at the start.\nWhen two functions approach zero, their ratio might do anything. We might have\nh2\nh\nN 0\nor\nh\nh\nN 1\nor\n?\nh\nh\nN\n8:\nNo clue comes from 0=0: When matters is whether the top or bottom goes to zero\nmore quickly. Roughly speaking, we want to show that .cos h\n1/=h is like h2=h\nand .sin h/=h is like h=h:\nTime out The graph of sin x is in Figure 2.9 (in black). The graph of sin.x Cx/\nsits just beside it (in red). The height difference is f when the shift distance is x:\nFig. 2.9\nsin.x Ch/ with h D 10\nD =18 radians. f =x is close to cos x:\nNow divide by that small number x (or h). The second figure shows f=x:\nIt is close to cos x: (Look how it starts--it is not quite cos x:) Mathematics will prove\nthat the limit is cos x exactly, when x\nN 0: Curiously, the reasoning concentrates\non only one point .x D 0/: The slope at that point is cos 0 D 1:\nWe now prove this: sin x divided by x goes to 1: The sine curve starts with\nslope 1: By the addition formula for sin.x Ch/, this answer at one point will lead to\nthe slope cos x at all points.\nQuestion Why does the graph of f .x Cx/ shift left from f .x/ when x\n¡ 0 ?\nAnswer\nWhen x D 0, the shifted graph is already showing f .x/: In Figure 2.9a,\nthe red graph is shifted left from the black graph. The red graph shows sin h when the\nblack graph shows sin 0:\nTHE LIMIT OF .sin h/=h IS 1\nThere are several ways to find this limit. The direct approach is to let a computer draw\na graph. Figure 2.10a is very convincing. The function .sin h/=h approaches 1 at\nthe key point h D 0. So does .tan h/=h: In practice, the only danger is that you might\nget a message like \"undefined function\" and no graph. (The machine may refuse to\ndivide by zero at h D 0: Probably you can get around that.) Because of the importance\nof this limit, I want to give a mathematical proof that it equals 1:\nFigure 2.10b indicates, but still only graphically, that sin h stays below h: (The\nfirst graph shows that too; .sin h/=h is below 1:) We also see that tan h stays above\nh: Remember that the tangent is the ratio of sine to cosine. Dividing by the cosine is\nenough to push the tangent above h: The crucial inequalities (to be proved when h is\nsmall and positive) are\nsin h\nh\nand\ntan h\n¡ h:\n(7)\n\n2.4\nThe Derivative of the Sine and Cosine\nFig. 2.10\n.sin h/=h squeezed between cos x and 1I.tan h/=h decreases to 1:\nSince tan h D .sin h/=.cos h/, those are the same as\nsin h\nh\nand\nsin h\nh\n¡ cos h:\n(8)\nWhat happens as h goes to zero ? The ratio .sin h/=h is squeezed between cos h\nand 1. But cos h is approaching 1! The squeeze as h\nN 0 leaves only one possibility\nfor .sin h/=h, which is caught in between: The ratio .sin h/=h approaches 1.\nFigure 2.10 shows that \"squeeze play.\" If two functions approach the same limit,\nso does any function caught in between. This is proved at the end of Section 2:6:\nFor negative values of h, which are absolutely allowed, the result is the same. To the\nleft of zero, h reverses sign and sin h reverses sign. The ratio .sin h/=h is unchanged.\n(The sine is an odd function: sin. h/ D\nsin h:) The ratio is an even function,\nsymmetric around zero and approaching 1 from both sides.\nThe proof depends on sin h\nh\ntan h, which is displayed by the graph but not\nexplained. We go back to right triangles.\nFig. 2.11\nLine shorter than arc: 2 sin h\n2h: Areas give h\ntan h:\nFigure 2.11a shows why sin h\nh: The straight line PQ has length 2 sin h: The\ncircular arc must be longer, because the shortest distance between two points is a\nstraight line. The arc PQ has length 2h: (Important: When the radius is 1, the arc\nlength equals the angle. The full circumference is 2 and the full angle is also 2:)\nThe straight distance 2 sin h is less than the circular distance 2h; so sin h\nh.\nFigure 2.11b shows why h\ntan h: This time we look at areas. The triangular area\nis 1\n2(base)(height)D 1\n2.1/.tan h/: Inside that triangle is the shaded sector of the circle.\nIf we try to prove that, we will be here all night. Accept it as true.\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nIts area is h=2 times the area of the whole circle (because the angle is that fraction\nof the whole angle). The circle has area r2 D , so multiplication by h=2 gives\n2h for the area of the sector. Comparing with the triangle around it, 1\n2 tan h\n¡ 1\n2h:\nThe inequalities sin h\nh\ntan h are now proved. The squeeze in equation (8)\nproduces .sin h/=h\nN 1: Q.E.D. Problem 13 shows how to prove sin h\nh from\nareas.\nNote\nAll angles x and h are being measured in radians. In degrees, cos x is not\nthe derivative of sin x. A degree is much less than a radian, and dy=dx is reduced\nby the factor 2=360:\nTHE LIMIT OF .cos h\n1/=h IS 0\nThis second limit is different. We will show that 1\ncos h shrinks to zero more quickly\nthan h: Cosines are connected to sines by .sin h/2 C.cos h/2 D 1: We start from the\nknown fact sin h\nh and work it into a form involving cosines:\n.1\ncos h/.1Ccos h/ D 1\n.cos h/2 D .sin h/2\nh2:\n(9)\nNote that everything is positive. Divide through by h and also by 1Ccos h:\ncos h\nh\n\nh\n1Ccos h:\n(10)\nOur ratio is caught in the middle. The right side goes to zero because h\nN 0. This\nis another \"squeeze\"--there is no escape. Our ratio goes to zero.\nFor cos h\n1 or for negative h, the signs change but minus zero is still zero. This\nconfirms equation (6). The slope of sin x is cos x:\nRemark\nEquation (10) also shows that 1\ncos h is approximately 1\n2 h2: The\n2 comes from 1Ccos h: This is a basic purpose of calculus--to find simple\napproximations like 1\n2h2: A \"tangent parabola\" 1\n2h2 is close to the top of the\ncosine curve.\nTHE DERIVATIVE OF THE COSINE\nThis will be easy. The quick way to differentiate cos x is to shift the sine curve by\n=2: That yields the cosine curve (solid line in Figure 2.12b). The derivative also\nshifts by =2 (dotted line). The derivative of cos x is\nsin x.\nNotice how the dotted line (the slope) goes below zero when the solid line\nturns downward. The slope equals zero when the solid line is level. Increasing\nfunctions have positive slopes. Decreasing functions have negative slopes. That\nis important, and we return to it.\nThere is more information in dy=dx than \"function rising\" or \"function falling.\"\nThe slope tells how quickly the function goes up or down. It gives the rate of change.\nThe slope of y D cos x can be computed in the normal way, as the limit of y=x:\ny\nx D cos.x Ch/\ncos x\nh\nD cos x\ncos h\nh\n\nsin x\nsin h\nh\n\ndy\ndx D .cos x/.0/\n.sin x/.1/ D\nsin x:\n(11)\nThe first line came from formula (3) for cos.x Ch/: The second line took limits,\nreaching 0 and 1 as before. This confirms the graphical proof that the slope of cos x\nis\nsin x:\n\n2.4\nThe Derivative of the Sine and Cosine\nFig. 2.12\ny.x/ increases where y\n1 is positive. y.x/ bends up where y\n2 is positive.\nTHE SECOND DERIVATIVES OF THE SINE AND COSINE\nWe now introduce the derivative of the derivative. That is the second derivative of\nthe original function. It tells how fast the slope is changing, not how fast y itself is\nchanging. The second derivative is the \"rate of change of the velocity.\" A straight line\nhas constant slope (constant velocity), so its second derivative is zero:\nf .t/ D 5t\nhas\ndf=dt D 5\nand\nd 2f=dt2 D 0:\nThe parabola y D x2 has slope 2x (linear) which has slope 2 (constant). Similarly\nf .t/ D 1\n2 at2\nhas\ndf=dt D at\nand\nd 2f=dt2 D a:\nThere stands the notation d 2f=dt2 (or d 2y=dx2) for the second derivative. A short\nform is f\n2 or y\n2: (This is pronouncedf double prime or y double prime). Example:\nThe second derivative of y D x3 is y\n2 D 6x:\nIn the distance-velocity problem, f\n2 is acceleration. It tells how fast v is changing,\nwhile v tells how fast f is changing. Where df=dt was distance=time, the second\nderivative is distance=(time)2: The acceleration due to gravity is about 32 ft=sec2 or\n9:8 m=sec2, which means that v increases by 32 ft=sec in one second. It does not\nmean that the distance increases by 32 feet!\nThe graph of y D sin t increases at the start. Its derivative cos t is positive.\nHowever the second derivative is\nsin t: The curve is bending down while\ngoing up. The arch is \"concave down\" because y\n2 D\nsin t is negative.\nAt t D the curve reaches zero and goes negative. The second derivative becomes\npositive. Now the curve bends upward. The lower arch is \"concave up.\"\ny\n¡ 0 means that y\n1 increases so y bends upward (concave up)\ny\n0 means that y\n1 decreases so y bends down (concave down).\nChapter 3 studies these things properly--here we get an advance look for sin t:\nThe remarkable fact about the sine and cosine is that y\n2 D\ny: That is unusual and\nspecial: accelerationD\ndistance: The greater the distance, the greater the force\npulling back:\ny D sin t\nhas\ndy=dt D Ccos t\nand\nd 2y=dt2 D\nsin t D\ny:\ny D cos t\nhas\ndy=dt D\nsin t\nand\nd 2y=dt2 D\ncos t D\ny:\nQuestion Does d 2y=dt2\n0 mean that the distance y.t/ is decreasing?\nAnswer\nNo. Absolutely not! It means that dy=dt is decreasing, not necessarily y:\nAt the start of the sine curve, y is still increasing but y\n0:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nSines and cosines give simple harmonic motion--up and down, forward and back,\nout and in, tension and compression. Stretch a spring, and the restoring force pulls\nit back. Push a swing up, and gravity brings it down. These motions are controlled\nby a differential equation:\nd 2y\ndt2 D\ny:\n(12)\nAll solutions are combinations of the sine and cosine: y D A sin t CB cos t:\nThis is not a course on differential equations. But you have to see the purpose of\ncalculus. It models events by equations. It models oscillation by equation (12). Your\nheart fills and empties. Balls bounce. Current alternates. The economy goes up and\ndown:\nhigh prices\nN high production\nN low prices\nN\n\nWe can't live without oscillations (or differential equations).\n2.4\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe derivative of y D sin x is y\n1 D\na\n. The second derivative\n(the\nb\nof\nthe\nderivative)\nis\ny\n2 D\nc\n.\nThe\nfourth\nderivative is y\n4 D\nd\n.

The sine of :01 radians is very close\nto\ni\n. So is the\nj\nof :01: The cosine of :01 is\nnot :99, because 1\ncos h is much\nk\nthan h: The ratio\n.1\ncos h/=h2 approaches\nl\n. Therefore cos h is close to\n2h2 and cos :01\n\nm\n. We can replace h by x:\nThe differential equation y\n2 D\ny leads to\nn\n. When y\nis positive, y\n2 is\no\n. Therefore y\n1 is\np\n.

If we know the separate derivatives of two functions u and v, then\nthe derivatives of uCv and uv and 1=v and u=v and un are immediately available.\nThis is a straightforward section, with those five rules to learn. It is also an\nimportant section, containing most of the working tools of differential calculus. But I\nam afraid that five rules and thirteen examples (which we need--the eyes glaze over\nwith formulas alone) make a long list. At least the easiest rule comes first. When we\nadd functions, we add their derivatives.\nSum Rule\nThe derivative of the sum u.x/Cv.x/ is d\ndx .uCv/ D du\ndx C dv\ndx :\n(1)\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe derivative of x Csin x is 1Ccos x: That is tremendously\nsimple, but it is fundamental. The interpretation for distances may be more\nconfusing (and more interesting) than the rule itself:\nSuppose a train moves with velocity 1: The distance at time t is t: On the train a\nprofessor paces back and forth (in simple harmonic motion). His distance from\nhis seat is sin t: Then the total distance from his starting point is t Csin t, and\nhis velocity (train speed plus walking speed) is 1Ccos t:\nIf you add distances, you add velocities. Actually that example is ridiculous, because\nthe professor's maximum speed equals the train speed .D 1/: He is running like mad,\nnot pacing. Occasionally he is standing still with respect to the ground.\nThe sum rule is a special case of a bigger rule called \"linearity.\" It applies when\nwe add or subtract functions and multiply them by constants--as in 3x\n4sin x:\nBy linearity the derivative is 3\n4cos x: The rule works for all functions u.x/ and\nv.x/: A linear combination is y.x/ D au.x/Cbv.x/, where a and b are any real\nnumbers. Then y=x is\nau.x Cx/Cbv.x Cx/\nau.x/\nbv.x/\nx\nD au.x Cx/\nu.x/\nx\nCb v.x Cx/\nv.x/\nx\n:\nThe limit on the left is dy=dx: The limit on the right is a du=dx Cb dv=dx: We are\nallowed to take limits separately and add. The result is what we hope for:\nRule of Linearity\nThe derivative of au.x/Cbv.x/ is d\ndx .auCbv/ D adu\ndx Cb dv\ndx :\n(2)\nThe product rule comes next. It can't be so simple--products are not linear. The\nsum rule is what you would have done anyway, but products give something new.\nThe derivative of u times v is not du=dx times dv=dx. Example: The derivative\nof x5 is 5x4: Don't multiply the derivatives of x3 and x2: (3x2 times 2x is not 5x4:)\nFor a product of two functions, the derivative has two terms.\nProduct Rule (the key to this section)\nThe derivative of u.x/v.x/ is d\ndx .uv/ D udv\ndx Cvdu\ndx :\n(3)\n\n2.5\nThe Product and Quotient and Power Rules\nEXAMPLE 2\nu D x3 times v D x2 is uv D x5: The product rule leads to 5x4:\nx3 dv\ndx Cx2 du\ndx D x3.2x/Cx2.3x2/ D 2x4C3x4 D 5x4:\nEXAMPLE 3\nIn the slope of x sin x, I don't write dx=dx D 1 but it's there:\nd\ndx .x sin x/ D x cos x Csin x:\nEXAMPLE 4\nIf u D sin x and v D sin x then uv D sin2x: We get two equal terms:\nsin x d\ndx .sin x/Csin x d\ndx .sin x/ D 2 sin x cos x:\nThis confirms the \"square rule\" 2u du=dx, when u is the same as v: Similarly the\nslope of cos2x is\n2 cos x sin x (minus sign from the slope of the cosine).\nQuestion Those answers for sin2x and cos2x have opposite signs, so the derivative\nof sin2x Ccos2x is zero (sum rule). How do you see that more quickly?\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe derivative of uvw is uvw\n1 Cuv\n1wCu\n1vw--one derivative at a\ntime. The derivative of xxx is xx Cxx Cxx:\nFig. 2.13\nChange in length D uCv: Change in area D uvCvuCuv:\nAfter those examples we prove the product rule. Figure 2.13 explains it best. The\narea of the big rectangle is uv: The important changes in area are the two strips\nuv and vu. The corner area uv is much smaller. When we divide by x,\nthe strips give uv=x and vu=x: The corner gives uv=x, which ap-\nproaches zero.\nNotice how the sum rule is in one dimension and the product rule is in two\ndimensions. The rule for uvw would be in three dimensions.\nThe extra area comes from the whole top strip plus the side strip. By algebra,\nu.x Ch/v.x Ch/\nu.x/v.x/ D u.x Ch/Œv.x Ch/\nv.x/Cv.x/Œu.x Ch/\nu.x/:\n(4)\nThis increase is u.x Ch/vCv.x/u--top plus side. Now divide by h (or x)\nand let h\nN 0. The left side of equation (4) becomes the derivative of u.x/v.x/: The\nright side becomes u.x/ times dv=dx--we can multiply the two limits--plus v.x/\ntimes du=dx: That proves the product rule--definitely useful.\nWe could go immediately to the quotient rule for u.x/=v.x/: But start with u D 1:\nThe derivative of 1=x is\n1=x2 (known). What is the derivative of 1=v.x/ ?\nReciprocal Rule\nThe derivative of\nv.x/ is\ndv=dx\nv2\n:\n(5)\n\nDerivatives\nThe proof starts with .v/.1=v/ D 1: The derivative of 1 is 0: Apply the product rule:\nv d\ndx\nv\n\nC 1\nv\ndv\ndx D 0\nso that\nd\ndx\nv\n\nD\ndv=dx\nv2\n:\n(6)\nIt is worth checking the units--in the reciprocal rule and others. A test of\ndimensions is automatic in science and engineering, and a good idea in\nmathematics. The test ignores constants and plus or minus signs, but it prevents bad\nerrors. If v is in dollars and x is in hours, dv=dx is in dollars per hour. Then\ndimensions agree:\nd\ndx\nv\n\n.1=dollars/\nhour\nand also\ndv=dx\nv2\ndollars=hour\n(dollars)2 :\nFrom this test, the derivative of 1=v cannot be 1=.dv=dx/: A similar test shows that\nEinstein's formula e D mc2 is dimensionally possible. The theory of relativity might\nbe correct! Both sides have the dimension of (mass)(distance)2=(time)2, when mass\nis converted to energy.\nEXAMPLE 6\nThe derivatives of x\n1;x\n2;x\nn are\n1x\n2;\n2x\n3;\nnx\nn 1:\nThose come from the reciprocal rule with v D x and x2 and any xn:\nd\ndx .x\nn/ D d\ndx\nxn\n\nD\nnxn 1\n.xn/2 D\nnx\nn 1:\nThe beautiful thing is that this answer\nnx\nn 1 fits into the same pattern as xn:\nMultiply by the exponent and reduce it by one.\nFor negative and positive exponents the derivative of xn is nxn 1:\n(7)\nReciprocal\nv Cv\nv D\nv\nv.v Cv/\nQuotient\nuCu\nv Cv\nu\nv D vu\nuv\nv.v Cv/\nFig. 2.14\nReciprocal rule from .v/=v2: Quotient rule from .vu\nuv/=v2:\nEXAMPLE 7\nThe derivatives of\ncos x and\nsin x are Csin x\ncos2x and\ncos x\nsin2x :\nThose come directly from the reciprocal rule. In trigonometry, 1=cos x is the secant\nof the angle x, and 1=sin x is the cosecant of x: Now we have their derivatives:\nd\ndx .sec x/ D\nsin x\ncos2x D\ncos x\nsin x\ncos x D sec x tan x:\n(8)\nd\ndx .csc x/ D\ncos x\nsin2x D\n\nsin x\ncos x\nsin x D\ncsc x cot x:\n(9)\nBut only Einstein knew that the constant is 1:\n\n2.5\nThe Product and Quotient and Power Rules\nThose formulas are often seen in calculus. If you have a good memory they are\nworth storing. Like most mathematicians, I have to check them every time before\nusing them (maybe once a year). It is really the rules that are basic, not the formulas.\nThe next rule applies to the quotient u.x/=v.x/: That is u times 1=v: Combining\nthe product rule and reciprocal rule gives something new and important:\nQuotient Rule\nThe derivative of\nu.x/\nv.x/\nis\nv\ndu\ndx\nudv=dx\nv2\nD vdu=dx\nudv=dx\nv2\n:\nYou must memorize that last formula. The v2 is familiar. The rest is new, but\nnot very new. If v D 1 the result is du=dx (of course). For u D 1 we have the\nreciprocal rule. Figure 2.14b shows the difference .uCu/=.vCv/\n.u=v/: The\ndenominator v.vCv/ is responsible for v2:\nEXAMPLE 8\n(onlypractice) If u=v D x5=x3 (whichis x2) the quotientrule gives2x:\nd\ndx\nx5\nx3\n\nD x3.5x4/\nx5.3x2/\nx6\nD 5x7\n3x7\nx6\nD 2x:\nEXAMPLE 9\n(important) For u D sin x and v D cos x, the quotient is sin x=cos x D\ntan x: The derivative of tan x is sec2x. Use the quotient rule and cos2x Csin2x D 1 W\nd\ndx\nsin x\ncos x\n\nD cos x .cos x/\nsin x . sin x/\ncos2x\nD\ncos2x D sec2x:\n(11)\nAgain to memorize: .tan x/\n1 D sec2x: At x D 0, this slope is 1. The graphs of sin x\nand x and tan x all start with this slope (then they separate). At x D =2 the sine\ncurve is flat .cos x D 0/ and the tangent curve is vertical .sec2x D\n8/:\nThe slope generally blows up faster than the function. We divide by cos x, once\nfor the tangent and twice for its slope. The slope of 1=x is\n1=x2: The slope is more\nsensitive than the function, because of the square in the denominator.\nEXAMPLE 10\nd\ndx\nsin x\nx\n\nD x cos x\nsin x\nx2\n:\nThat one I hesitate to touch at x D 0: Formally it becomes 0=0: In reality it is more\nlike 03=02, and the true derivative is zero. Figure 2.10 showed graphically that .sin x/=x\nis flat at the center point. The function is even (symmetric across the y axis) so its\nderivative can only be zero.\nThis section is full of rules, and I hope you will allow one more. It goes beyond\nxn to .u.x//n: A power of x changes to a power of u.x/--as in .sin x/6 or .tan x/7\nor .x2 C1/8: The derivative contains nun 1 (copying nxn 1), but there is an extra\nfactor du=dx: Watch that factor in 6.sin x/5 cos x and 7.tan x/6sec2x and\n8.x2C1/7.2x/:\nPower Rule\nThe derivative of\nh\nu.x/\nin\nis\nn\nh\nu.x/\nin 1 du\ndx :\n(12)\nFor n D 1 this reduces to du=dx D du=dx: For n D 2 we get the square rule\n2u du=dx: Next comes u3: The best approach is to use mathematical induction,\n\nDerivatives\nwhich goes from each n to the next power nC1 by the product rule:\nd\ndx .unC1/ D d\ndx .unu/ D undu\ndx Cu\n\nnun 1 du\ndx\n\nD .nC1/un du\ndx :\nThat is exactly equation (12) for the power nC1: We get all positive powers this way,\ngoing up from n D 1--then the negative powers come from the reciprocal rule.\nFigure 2.15 shows the power rule for n D 1;2;3: The cube makes the point\nbest. The three thin slabs are u by u by u: The change in volume is essentially\n3u2u: From multiplying out .uCu/3, the exact change in volume is\n3u2uC3u.u/2C.u/3--which also accounts for three narrow boxes and a\nmidget cube in the corner. This is the binomial formula in a picture.\nFig. 2.15\nLength change D u; area change\n2uu; volume change\n3u2u:\nEXAMPLE 11\nd\ndx .sin x/n D n.sin x/n 1 cos x: The extra factor cos x is du=dx:\nOur last step finally escapes from a very undesirable restriction--that n must be\na whole number. We want to allow fractional powers n D p=q, and keep the same\nformula. The derivative of xn is still nxn 1.\nTo deal with square roots I can write .\n?x/2 D x: Its derivative is 2\n?x.\n?x/\n1 D 1:\nTherefore .\n?x/\n1 is 1=2\n?x, which fits the formula when n D 1\n2: Now try n D p=q:\nFractional powers Write u D xp=q as uq D xp: Take derivatives, assuming they\nexist:\nquq\n1 du\ndx Dpxp\n(power rule on both sides)\ndu\ndx D px\nqu\n(cancel xp with uq)\ndu\ndx Dnxn 1\n(replace p=q by n and u by xn)\nEXAMPLE 12\nThe slope of x1=3 is 1\n3x\n2=3: The slope is infinite at x D 0 and\nzero at x D\n8: But the curve in Figure 2.16 keeps climbing.

Its slope follows the cube root curve (times 4\n3).\nWE STOP NOW! I am sorry there were so many rules. A computer can memorize\nthem all, but it doesn't know what they mean and you do.

It is true that we have\nsurvived this far without one, and we could continue. But this seems a reasonable\ntime to define limits more carefully. The goal is to achieve rigor without rigor mortis.\nFirst you should know that limits of y=x are by no means the only limits in\nmathematics. Here are five completely different examples. They involve n\nN\n8, not\nx\nN 0:\n1. an D .n\n3/=.nC3/\n(for large n, ignore the 3's and find an\nN 1)\n2. an D 1\n2an 1 C4\n(start with any a1 and always a\nN 8)\n3. an D probability of living to year n\n(unfortunately an\nN 0)\n4. an D fraction of zeros among the first n digits of\n.an\nN 1\n10 ‹/\n5. a1 D :4; a2 D :49; a3 D :493; ::: No matter what the remaining decimals are,\nthe a's converge to a limit. Possibly an\nN :493000 ..., but not likely.\nThe problem is to say what the limit symbol\nN\nreally means.\nA good starting point is to ask about convergence to zero. When does a sequence\nof positive numbers approach zero ? What does it mean to write an\nN 0 ? The\nnumbers a1;a2;a3; ::: ; must become \"small,\" but that is too vague. We will propose\nfour definitions of convergence to zero, and I hope the right one will be clear .\n1. All the numbers an are below 10\n10. That may be enough for practical\npurposes, but it certainly doesn't make the an approach zero.\n2. The sequence is getting closer to zero--each anC1 is smaller than the preceding\nan: This test is met by 1:1, 1:01, 1:001, ...which converges to 1 instead of 0:\n3. For any small number you think of, at least one of the an's is smaller. That\npushes something toward zero, but not necessarily the whole sequence. The condition\nwould be satisfied by 1; 1\n2;1; 1\n3;1; 1\n4;:::, which does not approach zero.\n4. For any small number you think of, the an's eventually go below that number\nand stay below. This is the correct definition.\nI want to repeat that. To test for convergence to zero, start with a small number--\nsay 10\n10: The an's must go below that number. They may come back up and go\nbelow again--the first million terms make absolutely no difference. Neither do the\nnext billion, but eventually all terms must go below 10\n10: After waiting longer\n(possibly a lot longer), all terms drop below 10\n20: The tail end of the sequence\ndecides everything.\nQuestion\nDoes\nthe\nsequence\n3;10\n2;10\n6;10\n5;10\n9;10\n8; :::\napproach 0 ?\nAnswer\nYes, These up and down numbers eventually stay below any \":\nFig. 2.17\nConvergence means: Only a finite number of a's are outside any strip around L.\n\nDerivatives\nQuestion 2\nDoes 10\n4;10\n6;10\n4;10\n8;10\n4;10\n10;::: approach zero ?\nAnswer\nNo. This sequence goes below 10\n4 but does not stay below.\nThere is a recognized symbol for \"an arbitrarily small positive number.\" By\nworldwide agreement, it is the Greek letter \" (epsilon). Convergence to zero means\nthat the sequence eventually goes below \" and stays there. The smaller the \",\nthe tougher the test and the longer we wait. Think of \" as the tolerance, and keep\nreducing it.\nTo emphasize that \" comes from outside, Socrates can choose it. Whatever \" he\nproposes, the a's must eventually be smaller. After some aN , all the a's are below\nthe tolerance \". Here is the exact statement:\nfor any \" there is an N such that an\n\" if n\n¡ N:\nOnce you see that idea, the rest is easy. Figure 2.17 has N D 3 and then N D 6:\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe sequence 1\n2; 4\n4; 9\n8; ::: starts upward but goes to zero. Notice that\n1;4;9; :::;100; ::: are squares, and 2;4;8; :::;1024; ::: are powers of 2: Eventually\n2n grows faster than n2, as in a10 D 100=1024: The ratio goes below any \":\nEXAMPLE 2\n1;0; 1\n2;0; 1\n3;0; ::: approaches zero. These a's do not decrease steadily\n(the mathematical word for steadily is \"monotonically\") but still their limit is zero.\nThe choice \" D 1=10 produces the right response: Beyond a2001 all terms are below\n1=1000: So N D 2001 for that \":\nThe sequence 1; 1\n2; 1\n2; 1\n3; 1\n3; 1\n3; ::: is much slower--but it also converges to zero.\nNext we allow the numbers an to be negative as well as positive. They can converge\nupward toward zero, or they can come in from both sides. The test still requires the\nan to go inside any strip near zero (and stay there). But now the strip starts at\n\":\nThe distance from zero is the absolute value\n|an\n|. Therefore an\nN 0 means\n|an\n|\nN 0: The previous test can be applied to\n|an\n|:\nfor any \" there is an N such that\n|an\n|\n\" if n\n¡ N .\nEXAMPLE 3\n1;\n2; 1\n3;\n4; ::: converges to zero because 1; 1\n2; 1\n3; 1\n4; ::: converges\nto zero.\nIt is a short step to limits other than zero. The limit is L if the numbers an\nL\nconverge to zero. Our final test applies to the absolute value\n|an\nL|:\nfor any \" there is an N such that\n|an\nL|\n\" if n\n¡ N .\nThis is the definition of convergence! Only a finite number of a's are outside any strip\naround L (Figure 2.18). We write an\nN L or lim an D L or limn N8 an D L:\nFig. 2.18\nan\nN 0 in Example 3; an\nN 1 in Example 4; an\nN\n8 in Example 5 (but\nanC1\nan\nN 0).\n\n2.6\nLimits\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe numbers 3\n2; 5\n4; 7\n6; ::: converge to L D 1: After subtracting 1 the\ndifferences 1\n2; 1\n4; 1\n6; ::: converge to zero. Those difference are\n|an\nL|:\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe sequence 1; 1C 1\n2; 1C 1\n2 C 1\n3; 1C 1\n2 C 1\n3 C 1\n4; ::: fails to converge.\nThe distance between terms is getting smaller. But those numbers a1; a2; a3; a4; :::\ngo past any proposed limit L: The second term is 1 1\n2: The fourth term adds on 1\n3 C 1\n4,\nso a4 goes past 2: The eighth term has four new fractions 1\n5 C 1\n6 C 1\n7 C 1\n8, totaling\nmore than 1\n8 C 1\n8 C 1\n8 C 1\n8 D 1\n2: Therefore a8 exceeds 2 1\n2: Eight more terms will add\nmore than 8 times\n16, so a16 is beyond 3: The lines in Figure 2.18c are infinitely\nlong, not stopping at any L:\nIn the language of Chapter 10, the harmonic series 1 C 1\n2 C 1\n3 C ::: does not\nconverge. The sum is infinite, because the \"partial sums\" an go beyond every limit L\n(a5000 is past L D 9). We will come back to infinite series, but this example makes a\nsubtle point: The steps between the an can go to zero while still an\nN\n8:\nThus the condition anC1\nan\nN 0 is not sufficient for convergence. However\nthis condition is necessary. If we do have convergence, then anC1\nan\nN 0: That\nis a good exercise in the logic of convergence, emphasizing the difference between\n\"sufficient\" and \"necessary.\" We discuss this logic below, after proving that [statement\nA] implies [statement B]:\nIf Œan converges to L then ŒanC1\nan converges to zero:\n(1)\nProof Because the an converge, there is a number N beyond which\n|an\nL|\n\"\nand also\n|anC1\nL|\n\": Since anC1\nan is the sum of anC1\nL and L\nan, its\nabsolute value cannot exceed \"C\" D 2\": Therefore anC1\nan approaches zero.\nObjection by Socrates: We only got below 2\" and he asked for \": Our reply: If he\nparticularly wants\n|anC1\nan\n|\n1=10,we start with \" D 1=20: Then 2\" D 1=10: But\nthis jugglingis not necessary.To stay below2\" is just as convincingas to stay below\":\nTHE LOGIC OF \"IF\" AND \"ONLY IF\"\nThe following page is inserted to help with the language of mathematics. In ordinary\nlanguage we might say \"I will come if you call.\" Or we might say \"I will come only\nif you call.\" That is different! A mathematician might even say \"I will come if and\nonly if you call.\" Our goal is to think through the logic, because it is important and\nnot so fami1iar.\nStatement A above implies statement B: Statement A is an\nN L; statement B is\nanC1\nan\nN 0: Mathematics has at least five ways of writing down A\nn B, and\nI though you might like to see them together. It seems excessive to have so many\nexpressions for the same idea, but authors get desperate for a little variety. Here are\nthe five ways that come to mind:\nA\nn B\nA implies B\nif A then B\nA is a sufficient condition for B\nB is true if A is true\nLogical thinking is much more important than \" and ı:\n\nDerivatives\nEXAMPLES If [positive numbers are decreasing] then [they converge to a limit].\nIf [sequences an and bn converge] then [the sequence an Cbn converges].\nIf [f .x/ is the integral of v.x/] then [v.x/ is the derivative of f .x/].\nThose are all true, but not proved. A is the hypothesis, B is the conclusion.\nNow we go in the other direction. (It is called the \"converse,\" not the inverse.) We\nexchange A and B. Of course stating the converse does not make it true! B might\nimply A, or it might not. In the first two examples the converse was false--the an\ncan converge without decreasing, and an Cbn can converge when the separate\nsequences do not. The converse of the third statement is true--and there are five\nmore ways to state it:\nA\nð B\nA is implied by B\nif B then A\nA is a necessary condition for B\nB is true only if A is true\nThose words \"necessary\" and \"sufficient\" are not always easy to master. The same\nis true of the deceptively short phrase \"if and only if.\" The two statements A\nn B and\nA\nð B are completely different and they both require proof. That means two sepa-\nrate proofs. But they can be stated together for convenience (when both are true):\nA\no B\nA implies B and B implies A\nA is equivalent to B\nA is a necessary and sufficient condition for B\nA is true if and only if B is true\nEXAMPLES Œan\nN L\no Œ2an\nN 2L\no Œan C1\nN LC1\no Œan\nL\nN 0:\nRULES FOR LIMITS\nCalculus needs a definition of limits, to define dy=dx: That derivative contains two\nlimits: x\nN 0 and y=x\nN dy=dx: Calculus also needs rules for limits, to prove\nthe sum rule and product rule for derivatives. We started on the definition, and now\nwe start on the rules.\nGiven two convergent sequences, an\nN L and bn\nN M, other sequences also\nconverge:\nAddition: an Cbn\nN LCM\nSubtraction: an\nbn\nN L\nM\nMultiplication: anbn\nN LM\nDivision: an=bn\nN L=M\n.provided M ¤ 0/\nWe check the multiplication rule, which uses a convenient identity:\nanbn\nLM D .an\nL/.bn\nM/CM.an\nL/CL.bn\nM/:\n(2)\nSuppose\n|an\nL|\n\" beyond some point N , and\n|bn\nM\n|\n\" beyond some other\npoint N\n1: Then beyond the larger of N and N\n1, the right side of .2/ is small. It is less\nthan \"\n\"CM\"CL\": This proves that .2/ gives anbn\nN LM:\nAn important special case is can\nN cL: (The sequence of b's is c;c;c;c;:::)\nThus a constant can be brought \"outside\" the limit, to give lim can D c lim an:\n\n2.6\nLimits\nTHE LIMIT OF f.x/ AS x\nN a\nThe final step is to replace sequences by functions. Instead of a1;a2;::: there is a\ncontinuum of values f .x/: The limit is taken as x approaches a specified point a\n(instead of n\nN\n8). Example: As x approaches a D 0, the function f .x/ D 4\nx2\napproachesL D 4: As x approaches a D 2, the function 5x approachesL D 10: Those\nstatements are fairly obvious, but we have to say what they mean. Somehow it must\nbe this:\nif x is close to a then f .x/ is close to L.\nIf x\na is small, then f .x/\nL should be small. As before, the word small does not\nsay everything. We really mean \"arbitrarily small,\" or \"below any \":\" The difference\nf .x/\nL must become as small as anyone wants, when x gets near a: In that case\nlimx\nNa f .x/ D L: Or we write f .x/\nN L as x\nN a:\nThe statement is awkward because it involves two limits. The limit x\nN a is forcing\nf .x/\nN L: (Previously n\nN\n8 forced a\nN L:) But it is wrong to expect the same \"\nin both limits. We do not and cannot require that\n|x\na\n|\n\" produces)\n|f .x/\nL|\n\n\": It may be necessary to push x extremely close to a (closer than \"). We must\nguarantee that if x is close enough to a, then\n|f .x/\nL|\n\":\nWe have come to the \"epsilon-delta definition\" of limits. First, Socrates chooses\n\": He has to be shown that f .x/ is within \" of L, for every x near a: Then somebody\nelse (maybe Plato) replies with a number ı: That gives the meaning of \"near a:\"\nPlato's goal is to get f .x/ within \" of L, by keeping x within ı of a:\nif\n\n|x\na\n|\nı\nthen\n|f .x/\nL|\n\":\n(3)\nThe input tolerance is ı (delta), the output tolerance is \": When Plato can find a ı\nfor every \", Socrates concedes that the limit is L:\nEXAMPLE Prove that lim\nx\nN2 5x D 10:\nIn this case a D 2 and L D 10:\nSocrates asks for\n|5x\n10 |\n\":Plato responds by requiring\n|x\n2 |\nı: What ı should\nhe choose? In this case\n|5x\n10 | is exactly 5 times\n|x\n2 |: So Plato picks ı below\n\"=5 (a smaller ı is always OK). Whenever\n|x\n2 |\n\"=5, multiplication by 5 shows\nthat\n|5x\n10 |\n\":\nRemark 1\nIn Figure 2.19, Socrates chooses the height of the box. It extends above\nand below L, by the small number \": Second, Plato chooses the width. He must make\nthe box narrow enough for the graph to go out the sides. Then\n|f .x/\nL|\n\":\nFig. 2.19\nS chooses height 2\", then P chooses width 2ı: Graph must go out the sides.\n\nDerivatives\nWhen f .x/ has a jump, the box can't hold it. A step function has no limit as x\napproaches the jump, because the graph goes through the top or bottom--no matter\nhow thin the box.\nRemark 2\nThe second figure has f .x/\nN L, because in taking limits we ignore\nthe final point x D a. The value f .a/ can be anything, with no effect on L: The first\nfigure has more: f .a/ equals L: Then a special name applies--f is continuous. The\nleft figure shows a continuous function, the other figures do not.\nWe soon come back to continuous functions.\nRemark 3\nIn the example with f D 5x and ı D \"=5, the number 5 was the slope.\nThat choice barely kept the graph in the box--it goes out the corners. A little narrower,\nsay ı D \"=10, and the graph goes safely out the sides. A reasonable choice is to\ndivide \" by 2 |f\n1.a/ |. (We double the slope for safety.) I want to say why this ı\nworks--even if the \"\nı test is seldom used in practice.\nThe ratio of f .x/\nL to x\na is distance up over distance across. This is f=x,\nclose to the slope f\n1.a/: When the distance across is ı, the distance up or down is\nnear ı\n|f\n1.a/ |: That equals \"=2 for our \"reasonable choice\" of ı--so we are safely\nbelow \": This choice solves most exercises. But Example 7 shows that a limit might\nexist even when the slope is infinite.\nEXAMPLE 7\nlim\nx\nN1C\n?\nx\n1 D 0\n(a one-sided limit).\nNotice the plus sign in the symbol x\nN 1C. The number x approaches a D 1 only\nfrom above. An ordinary limit x\nN 1 requires us to accept x on both sides of 1 (the\nexact value x D 1 is not considered). Since negative numbers are not allowed by the\nsquare root, we have a one-sided limit. It is L D 0:\nSuppose \" is 1=10: Then the response could be ı D 1=100: A number below 1=100\nhas a square root below 1=10: In this case the box must be made extremely narrow, ı\nmuch smaller than \", because the square root starts with infinite slope.\nThose examples show the point of the \"\nı definition. (Given \", look for ı: This\ncame from Cauchy in France, not Socrates in Greece.) We also see its bad feature: The\ntest is not convenient. Mathematicians do not go around proposing \"'s and replying\nwith ı's. We may live a strange life, but not that strange.\nIt is easier to establish once and for all that 5x approaches its obvious limit\n5a: The same is true for other familiar functions: xn\nN an and sin x\nN sin a\nand .1\nx/\nN .1\na/\n1--except at a D 1: The correct limit L comes by\nsubstituting x D a into the function. This is exactly the property of a \"continuous\nfunction.\" Before the section on continuous functions, we prove the Squeeze\nTheorem using \" and ı:\n2H Squeeze Theorem Suppose f .x/\n¤ g.x/\n¤ h.x/ for x near a: If f .x/\nN\nL and h.x/\nN L as x\nN a, then the limit of g.x/ is also L:\nProof g.x/ is squeezed between f .x/ and h.x/: After subtracting L, g.x/\nL is\nbetween f .x/\nL and h.x/\nL: Therefore\n|g.x/\nL|\n\"\nif\n|f .x/\nL|\n\"\nand\n|h.x/\nL|\n\":\nFor any \", the last two inequalities hold in some region 0\n\n|x\na\n|\nı: So the first\none also holds.

It was originally included with limits, but the\ncombination was too long. We are still concerned with the limit of f .x/ as x\nN a,\nbut a new number is involved. That number is f .a/, the value of f at x D a. For a\n\"limit,\" x approached a but never reached it--so f .a/ was ignored. For a \"continuous\nfunction,\" this final number f .a/ must be right.\nMay I summarize the usual (good) situation as x approaches a ?\n1. The number f .a/ exists\n(f is defined at a)\n2. The limit of f .x/ exists\n(it was called L)\n3. The limit L equals f .a/\n(f .a/ is the right value)\nIn such a case, f .x/ is continuous at x D a: These requirements are often written in\na single line: f .x/\nN f .a/ as x\nN a: By way of contrast, start with four functions\nthat are not continuous at x D 0:\nFig. 2.20\nFour types of discontinuity (others are possible) at x D 0:\nIn Figure 2.20, the first function would be continuous if it had f .0/ D 0: But\nit has f .0/ D 1: After changing f .0/ to the right value, the problem is gone. The\ndiscontinuity is removable. Examples 2;3;4 are more important and more serious.\nThere is no \"correct\" value for f .0/:\n2. f .x/ D step function\n(jump from 0 to 1 at x D 0)\n3. f .x/ D 1=x2\n(infinite limit as x\nN 0)\n4. f .x/ D sin.1=x/\n(infinite oscillation as x\nN 0).\nThe graphs show how the limit fails to exist. The step function has a jump\ndiscontinuity. It has one-sided limits, from the left and right. It does not have an\nordinary (two-sided) limit. The limit from the left (x\nN 0\n) is 0: The limit from the\nright (x\nN 0C) is 1: Another step function is x= |x\n|, which jumps from\n1 to 1:\nIn the graph of 1=x2, the only reasonable limit is L D C\n8: I cannot go on record\nas saying that this limit exists. Officially, it doesn't--but we often write it anyway:\n1=x2\nN\n8 as x\nN 0: This means that 1=x2 goes (and stays) above every L as x\nN 0:\nIn the same unofficial way we write one-sided limits for f .x/ D 1=x:\nFrom the left, lim\nx\nN0\n\nx D\n8:\nFrom the right, lim\nx\nN0C\nx D C 8:\n(1)\nRemark\n1=x has a \"pole\" at x D 0: So has 1=x2 (a double pole). The function\n1=.x2\nx/ has poles at x D 0 and x D 1: In each case the denominator goes to zero\nand the function goes to C8 or\n8: Similarly 1=sin x has a pole at every multiple\n\nDerivatives\nof (where sin x is zero). Except for 1=x2 these poles are \"simple\"--the functions\nare completely smooth at x D 0 when we multiply them by x:\n.x/\nx\n\nD 1 and .x/\n\nx2\nx\n\nD\nx\n1 and .x/\n\nsin x\n\nare continuous at x D 0:\n1=x2 has a double pole, since it needs multiplication by x2 (not just x). A ratio of\npolynomials P.x/=Q.x/ has poles where Q D 0, provided any common factors like\n.x C1/=.x C1/ are removed first.\nJumps and poles are the most basic discontinuities, but others can occur. The\nfourth graph shows that sin.1=x/ has no limit as x\nN 0: This function does not blow\nup; the sine never exceeds 1: At x D 1\n3 and 1\n4 and\n1000 it equals sin 3 and sin 4 and\nsin 1000: Those numbers are positive and negative and ( ? ). As x gets small and 1=x\ngets large, the sine oscillates faster and faster. Its graph won't stay in a small box of\nheight \", no matter how narrow the box.\nCONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS\nDEFINITION\nf is \"continuous at x D a\" if f .a/ is defined and f .x/\nN f .a/\nas x\nN a: If f is continuous at every point where it is defined, it is a continuous\nfunction.\nObjection\nThe definition makes f .x/ D 1=x a continuous function! It is not de-\nfined at x D 0, so its continuity can't fail. The logic requires us to accept this, but we\ndon't have to like it. Certainly there is no f .0/ that would make 1=x continuous at\nx D 0:\nIt is amazing but true that the definition of \"continuous function\" is still debated\n(Mathematics Teacher, May 1989). You see the reason--we speak about a\ndiscontinuity of 1=x, and at the same time call it a continuous function. The definition\nmisses the difference between 1=x and .sin x/=x: The function f .x/ D .sin x/=x\ncan be made continuous at all x. Just set f .0/ D 1:\nWe call a function \"continuable\" if its definition can be extended to all x in a\nway that makes it continuous. Thus .sin x/=x and\n?x are continuable. The functions\n1=x and tan x are not continuable. This suggestion may not end the debate, but I hope\nit is helpful.\nEXAMPLE 1\nsin x and cos x and all polynomials P.x/ are continuous functions.\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe absolute value\n|x\n| is continuous. Its slope jumps (not\ncontinuable).\nEXAMPLE 3\nAny rational function P.x/=Q.x/ is continuous except where\nQ D 0:\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe function that jumps between 1 at fractions and 0 at non-fractions\nis discontinuous everywhere. There is a fraction between every pair of non-fractions\nand vice versa. (Somehow there are many more non-fractions.)\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe function 0x2 is zero for every x, except that 00 is not defined.\nSo define it as zero and this function is continuous. But see the next paragraph where\n00 has to be 1:\n\n2.7\nContinuous Functions\nWe could fill the book with proofs of continuity, but usually the situation is clear.\n\"A function is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting up your pen.\"\nAt a jump, or an infinite limit, or an infinite oscillation, there is no way across the\ndiscontinuity except to start again on the other side. The function x\n2 is continuous\nfor n\n¡ 0: It is not continuable for n\n0: The function x0 equals 1 for every x,\nexcept that 00 is not defined. This time continuity requires 00 D 1:\nThe interesting examples are the close ones--we have seen two of them:\nEXAMPLE 6\nsin x\nx\nand\ncos x\nx\nare both continuable at x D 0:\nThose were crucial for the slope of sin x: The first approaches 1 and the second\napproaches 0: Strictly speaking we must give these functions the correct values\n(1 and 0) at the limiting point x D 0--which of course we do.\nIt is important to know what happens when the denominators change to x2:\nEXAMPLE 7\nsin x\nx2\nblows up but 1\ncos x\nx2\nhas the limit 1\n2 at x D 0:\nSince .sin x/=x approaches 1, dividing by another x gives a function like 1=x: There\nis a simple pole. It is an example of 0=0, in which the zero from x2 is reached more\nquickly than the zero from sin x: The \"race to zero\" produces almost all interesting\nproblems about limits.\nFor 1\ncos x and x2 the race is almost even. Their ratio is 1 to 2:\ncos x\nx2\nD\ncos2x\nx2.1Ccos x/ D sin2x\nx2\n\n1Ccos x\nN\n1C1\nas\nx\nN 0:\nThis answer\n2 will be found again (more easily) by \"l'Hopital's rule.\" Here I\nemphasize not the answer but the problem. A central question of differential\ncalculus is to know how fast the limit is approached. The speed of approach is\nexactly the information in the derivative.\nThese three examples are all continuous at x D 0: The race is controlled by the\nslope--because f .x/\nf .0/ is nearly f\n1.0/ times x:\nderivative of sin x is 1\nØ\nsin x decreases like x\nderivative of sin2x is 0\nØ\nsin2x decreases faster than x\nderivative of x1=3 is\nØ\nx1=3 decreases more slowly than x:\nDIFFERENTIABLE FUNCTIONS\nThe absolute value\n|x\n| is continuous at x D 0 but has no derivative. The same is true\nfor x1=3: Asking for a derivative is more than asking for continuity. The reason\nis fundamental, and carries us back to the key definitions:\nContinuous at x:\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/\nN0 as x\nN 0\nDerivative at x:\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/\nx\nNf\n1.x/ as x\nN 0:\n\nDerivatives\nIn the first case, f goes to zero (maybe slowly). In the second case, f goes to\nzero as fast as x (because f=x has a limit). That requirement is stronger:\n2I At a point where f .x/ has a derivative, the function must be continuous.\nBut f .x/ can be continuous with no derivative.\nProof The limit of f D .x/.f=x/ is .0/.df=dx/ D 0: So f .x Cx/\n\nf .x/\nN 0:\nThe continuous function x1=3 has no derivative at x D 0, because 1\n3x\n2=3 blows\nup. The absolute value\n|x\n| has no derivative because its slope jumps. The remarkable\nfunction 1\n2 cos 3x C 1\n4 cos 9x C\n\nis continuous at all points and has a derivative at\nno points. You can draw its graph without lifting your pen (but not easily--it turns\nat every point). To most people, it belongs with space-filling curves and\nunmeasurable areas--in a box of curiosities. Fractals used to go into the same box!\nThey are beautiful shapes, with boundaries that have no tangents. The theory of\nfractals is very alive, for good mathematical reasons, and we touch on it in\nSection 3:7:\nI hope you have a clear idea of these basic definitions of calculus:\n1 Limit .n\nN\n8 or x\nN a/\n2 Continuity (at x D a)\n3 Derivative (at x D a).\nThose go back to \" and ı, but it is seldom necessary to follow them so far. In the same\nway that economics describes many transactions, or history describes many events,\na function comes from many values f .x/: A few points may be special, like market\ncrashes or wars or discontinuities. At other points df=dx is the best guide to the\nfunction.\nThis chapter ends with two essential facts about a continuous function on a closed\ninterval. The interval is a\n¤ x\n¤ b, written simply as [a;b]. At the endpoints a and\nb we require f .x/ to approach f .a/ and f .b/:\nExtreme Value Property\nA continuous function on the finite interval Œa;b has a\nmaximum value M and a minimum value m: There are points xmax and xmin in Œa;b\nwhere it reaches those values:\nf .xmax/ D M\n¥ f .x/\n¥ f .xmin/ D m for all x in Œa;b:\nIntermediate Value Property If the number F is between f .a/ and f .b/, there is\na point c between a and b where f .c/ D F: Thus if F is between the minimum m\nand the maximum M, there is a point c between xmin and xmax where f .c/ D F:\nExamples show why we require closed intervals and continuous functions. For\nx\n¤ 1 the function f .x/ D x never reaches its minimum (zero). If we close the\ninterval by defining f .0/ D 3 (discontinuous) the minimum is still not reached.\nBecause of the jump, the intermediate value F D 2 is also not reached. The idea of\ncontinuity was inescapable, after Cauchy defined the idea of a limit.\nThe interval Œa;b is closed (endpoints included). The interval (a, b) is open (a and b left\nout). The infinite interval [0,\n8) contains all x\n¥ 0:\n\n2.7\nContinuous Functions\n2.7\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nContinuity requires the\na\nof f .x/ to exist as x\nN a and\nto agree with\nb\n.

      "content": "CHAPTER 3\nApplications of the Derivative\nChapter 2 concentrated on computing derivatives. This chapter concentrates on using\nthem. Our computations produced dy=dx for functions built from xn and sin x and\ncos x. Knowing the slope, and if necessary also the second derivative, we can answer\nthe questions about y D f .x/ that this subject was created for:\n1. How does y change when x changes?\n2. What is the maximum value of y? Or the minimum?\n3. How can you tell a maximum from a minimum, using derivatives?\nThe information in dy=dx is entirely local. It tells what is happening close to\nthe point and nowhere else. In Chapter 2, x and y went to zero. Now we want\nto get them back. The local information explains the larger picture, because y is\napproximately dy=dx times x.\nThe problem is to connect the finite to the infinitesimal--the average slope to the\ninstantaneous slope. Those slopes are close, and occasionally they are equal. Points\nof equality are assured by the Mean Value Theorem--which is the local-global\nconnection at the center of differential calculus. But we cannot predict where dy=dx\nequals y=x: Therefore we now find other ways to recover a function from its\nderivatives--or to estimate distance from velocity and acceleration.\nIt may seem surprising that we learn about y from dy=dx: All our work has been\ngoing the other way! We struggled with y to squeeze out dy=dx: Now we use dy=dx\nto study y: That's life. Perhaps it really is life, to understand one generation from later\ngenerations.\n\nApplications of the Derivative\n3.1 Linear Approximation\nThe book started with a straight line f D vt: The distance is linear when the velocity\nis constant. As soon as v begins to change, f D vt falls apart. Which velocity do we\nchoose, when v.t/ is not constant? The solution is to take very short time intervals,\nin which v is nearly constant:\nf D vt\nis completely false\nf D vt\nis nearly true\ndf D vdt\nis exactly true\nFor a brief moment the function f .t/ is linear--and stays near its tangent line.\nIn Section 2.3 we found the tangent line to y D f .x/: At x D a, the slope of the\ncurve and the slope of the line are f\n1.a/: For points on the line, start at y D f .a/:\nAdd the slope times the \"increment\" x\na:\nY D f .a/Cf\n1.a/.x\na/:\n(1)\nWe write a capital Y for the line and a small y for the curve. The whole point of\ntangents is that they are close .provided we don't move too far from a/:\ny\nY\nor\nf .x/\nf .a/Cf\n1.a/.x\na/:\n(2)\nThat is the all-purpose linear approximation. Figure 3.1 shows the square root\nfunction y D\n?x and its tangent line at x D a D 100: At the point y D\n?\n100 D 10,\nthe slope is 1=2\n?x D 1=20: The table beside the figure compares y.x/ with Y.x/:\nFig. 3.1\nY.x/ is the linear approximation to\n?x near x D a D 100:\nx\nY\ny D\n?x\nN 102\n10:1\n10:0995\n10:5\n10:49\n14:1\nThe accuracy gets worse as x departs from 100: The tangent line leaves the curve.\nThe arrow points to a good approximation at 102, and at 101 it would be even better.\nIn this example Y is larger than y--the straight line is above the curve. The slope\nof the line stays constant, and the slope of the curve is decreasing. Such a curve will\nsoon be called \"concave downward,\" and its tangent lines are above it.\nLook again at x D 102, where the approximation is good. In Chapter 2, when we\nwere approaching dy=dx, we started with y=x:\nslope\n\n?\n\n?\n:\n(3)\n\n3.1\nLinear Approximation\nNow that is turned around! The slope is 1=20: What we don't know is\n?\n102:\n?\n\n?\n100C(slope).102\n100/:\n(4)\nYou work with what you have. Earlier we didn't know dy=dx, so we used .3/: Now\nwe are experts at dy=dx, and we use .4/: After computing y\n1 D 1=20 once and for\nall, the tangent line stays near\n?x for every number near 100: When that nearby\nnumber is 100Cx, notice the error as the approximation is squared:\n\n?\n100C 1\n20x\nD 100Cx C 1\n400.x/2:\nThe desired answer is 100Cx, and we are off by the last term involving .x/2:\nThe whole point of linear approximation is to ignore every term after x:\nThere is nothing magic about x D 100, except that it has a nice square root. Other\npoints and other functions allow y\nY: I would like to express this same idea in\ndifferent symbols. Instead of starting from a and going to x, we start from x and go\na distance x to x Cx. The letters are different but the mathematics is identical.\n3A At any point x, and for any smooth function y D f .x/,\nslope at x\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/\nx\n:\n(5)\nFor the approximation to f .x Cx/, multiply both sides by x and add f .x/:\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/C.slope at x/.x/:\n(6)\nEXAMPLE 1\nAn important linear approximation: .1Cx/n\n1Cnx for x near zero.\nEXAMPLE 2\nA second important approximation: 1=.1Cx/n\nnx for x near zero.\nDiscussion Those are really the same. By changing n to\nn in Example 1, it\nbecomes Example 2. These are linear approximations using the slopes n and\nn\nat x D 0:\n.1Cx/n\n1C.slope at zero/ times .x\n0/ D 1Cnx:\nHere is the same thing with f .x/ D xn: The basepoint in equation (6) is now 1 or x:\n.1Cx/n\n1Cnx\n.x Cx/n\nxn Cnxn 1x:\nBetter than that, here are numbers. For n D 3 and\n1 and 100, take x D :01:\n.1:01/3\n1:03\n1:01\n:99\n\n1C 1\nActually that last number is no good. The 100th power is too much. Linear\napproximation gives 1C100x D 2, but a calculator gives .1:01/100 D 2:7:::: This\nis close to e, the all-important number in Chapter 6. The binomial formula shows why\nthe approximation failed:\n.1Cx/100 D 1C100x C .100/.99/\n.2/.1/\n.x/2 C\n\n:\nLinear approximation forgets the .x/2 term. For x D 1=100 that error is nearly\n2: It is too big to overlook. The exact error is 1\n2.x/2f\n2.c/, where the Mean Value\nTheorem in Section 3.8 places c between x and x Cx: You already see the point:\ny\nY is of order .x/2: Linear approximation, quadratic error.\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nDIFFERENTIALS\nThere is one more notation for this linear approximation. It has to be presented,\nbecause it is often used. The notation is suggestive and confusing at the same time--it\nkeeps the same symbols dx and dy that appear in the derivative. Earlier we\ntook great pains to emphasize that dy=dx is not an ordinary fraction. Until this\nparagraph, dx and dy have had no independent meaning. Now they become\nseparate variables, like x and y but with their own names. These quantities dx and dy\nare called differentials.\nThe symbols dx and dy measure changes along the tangent line. They do for the\napproximation Y.x/ exactly what x and y did for y.x/: Thus dx and x both\nmeasure distance across.\nFigure 3.2 has x D dx: But the change in y does not equal the change in Y:\nOne is y (exact for the function). The other is dy (exact for the tangent line). The\ndifferential dy is equal to Y , the change along the tangent line. Where y is\nthe true change, dy is its linear approximation .dy=dx/dx:\nYou often see dy written as f\n1.x/dx:\ny Dchange in y (along curve)\ndy Dchange in Y (along tangent)\nFig. 3.2\nThe linear approximation to y is\ndy D f\n1.x/dx:\nEXAMPLE 3\ny D x2 has dy=dx D 2x so dy D 2xdx: The table has basepoint\nx D 2: The prediction dy differs from the true y by exactly .x/2 D :01 and :04\nand :09:\ndx\ndy\nx\ny\ny D x2\n.1\n0.4\n.1\n0.41\ny D .2Cx/2\ndy D 4dx\n.2\n0.8\n.2\n0.84\ny D 4x C.x/2\n.3\n1.2\n.3\n1.29\nThe differential dy D f\n1.x/dx is consistent with the derivative dy=dx D f\n1.x/:\nWe finally have dy D .dy=dx/dx, but this is not as obvious as it seems! It looks like\ncancellation--it is really a definition. Entirely new symbols could be used, but dx and\ndy have two advantages: They suggest small steps and they satisfy dy D f\n1.x/dx:\nHere are three examples and three rules:\nd.xn/Dnxn 1dx\nd.f Cg/Ddf Cdg\nd.sin x/Dcos x dx\nd.cf /Dc df\nd.tan x/Dsec2x dx\nd.fg/Df dg Cg df\nScience and engineering and virtually all applications of mathematics depend on\nlinear approximation. The true function is \"linearized,\" using its slope v:\nFraction or not, it is absolutely forbidden to cancel the d's\n\n3.1\nLinear Approximation\nIncreasing the time by t increases the distance by\nvt\nIncreasing the force by f increases the deflection by\nvf\nIncreasing the production by p increases its value by\nvp:\nThe goal of dynamics or statics or economics is to predict this multiplier v--the\nderivative that equals the slope of the tangent line. The multiplier gives a local\nprediction of the change in the function. The exact law is nonlinear--but Ohm's law\nand Hooke's law and Newton's law are linear approximations.\nABSOLUTE CHANGE, RELATIVE CHANGE, PERCENTAGE CHANGE\nThe change y or f can be measured in three ways. So can x:\nAbsolute change\nf\nx\nRelative change\nf\nf .x/\nx\nx\nPercentage change\nf\nf .x/\nx\nx\nRelative change is often more realistic than absolute change. If we know the distance\nto the moon within three miles, that is more impressive than knowing our own height\nwithin one inch. Absolutely, one inch is closer than three miles. Relatively, three miles\nis much closer:\n3 miles\n300;000 miles\n\n1 inch\n70 inches\nor\n:001%\n1:4%:\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe radius of the Earth is within 80 miles of r D 4;000 miles.\n(a) Find the variation dV in the volume V D 4\n3r3, using linear approximation.\n(b) Compute the relative variations dr=r and dV=V and V=V:\nSolution\nThe job of calculus is to produce the derivative. After dV=dr D 4r2,\nits work is done. The variation in volume is dV D 4.4000/2.80/ cubic miles.

The shell is added when the radius\ngrows by dr: The exact V=V is 3917312=640000%; but calculus just calls it 6%:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\n3.1\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nOn the graph, a linear approximation is given by the\na\nline.

If the slope is negative, how is that\nreflected in the function? Then the third question is the critical one:\nHow do you identify a maximum or minimum?\nNormal answer: The slope is zero.\nThis may be the most important application of calculus, to reach df=dx D 0:\nTake the easy questions first. Suppose df=dx is positive for every x between\na and b: All tangent lines slope upward. The function f .x/ is increasing as x goes\nfrom a to b.\n3B If df=dx\n¡ 0 then f .x/ is increasing. If df=dx\n0 then f .x/\nis decreasing.\nTo define increasing and decreasing, look at any two points x\nX: \"Increasing\"\nrequires f .x/\nf .X/: \"Decreasing\" requires f .x/\n¡ f .X/: A positive slope does\nnot mean a positive function. The function itself can be positive or negative.\nEXAMPLE 1\nf .x/ D x2\n2x has slope 2x\n2: This slope is positive when x\n¡ 1\nand negative when x\n1: The function increases after x D 1 and decreases before\nx D 1:\nFig. 3.3\nSlopes are\nC: Slope is C\nC\nC so f is up-down-up-down-up.\nWe say that without computing f .x/ at any point! The parabola in Figure 3.3 goes\ndown to its minimum at x D 1 and up again.\nEXAMPLE 2\nx2\n2x C5 has the same slope. Its graph is shifted up by 5, a\nnumber that disappears in df=dx: All functions with slope 2x\n2 are parabolas\nx2\n2x CC , shifted up or down according to C: Some parabolas cross the x axis\n(those crossings are solutions to f .x/ D 0/: Other parabolas stay above the axis. The\nsolutions to x2\n2x C5 D 0 are complex numbers and we don't see them. The\nspecial parabola x2\n2x C1 D .x\n1/2 grazes the axis at x D 1: It has a \"double\nzero,\" where f .x/ D df=dx D 0:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nEXAMPLE 3\nSuppose df=dx D .x\n1/.x\n2/.x\n3/.x\n4/: This slope is\npositive beyond x D 4 and up to x D 1 (df=dx D 24 at x D 0). And df=dx is\npositive again between 2 and 3: At x D 1;2;3;4, this slope is zero and f .x/\nchanges direction.\nHere f .x/ is a fifth-degree polynomial, because f\n1.x/ is fourth-degree. The graph\nof f goes up-down-up-down-up. It might cross the x axis five times. It must cross\nat least once (like this one). When complex numbers are allowed, every fifth-degree\npolynomial has five roots.\nYou may feel that \"positive slope implies increasing function\" is obvious--perhaps\nit is. But there is still something delicate. Starting from df=dx\n¡ 0 at every single\npoint, we have to deduce f .X/\n¡f .x/ at pairs of points. That is a \"local to global\"\nquestion, to be handled by the Mean Value Theorem. It could also wait for the\nFundamental Theorem of Calculus: The difference f .X/\nf .x/ equals the area\nunder the graph of df=dx. That area is positive, so f .X/ exceeds f .x/:\nMAXIMA AND MINIMA\nWhich x makes f .x/ as large as possible? Where is the smallest f .x/? Without\ncalculus we are reduced to computing values of f .x/ and comparing. With calculus,\nthe information is in df=dx:\nSuppose the maximum or minimum is at a particular point x: It is possible that\nthe graph has a corner--and no derivative. But if df=dx exists, it must be zero. The\ntangent line is level. The parabolas in Figure 3.3 change from decreasing to increasing.\nThe slope changes from negative to positive. At this crucial point the slope is zero.\n3C Local Maximum or Minimum\nSuppose the maximum or minimum\noccurs at a point x inside an interval where f .x/ and df=dx are defined. Then\nf\n1.x/ D 0:\nThe word \"local\" allows the possibility that in other intervals, f .x/ goes higher or\nlower. We only look near x, and we use the definition of df=dx:\nStart with f .x Cx/\nf .x/: If f .x/ is the maximum, this difference is negative\nor zero. The step x can be forward or backward:\nif x\n¡ 0 W\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/\nx\nD negative\npositive\n¤ 0\nand in the limit\ndf\ndx\n¤ 0:\nif x\n0 W\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/\nx\nD negative\nnegative\n¥ 0\nand in the limit\ndf\ndx\n¥ 0:\nBoth arguments apply. Both conclusions df=dx\n¤ 0 and df=dx\n¥ 0 are correct. Thus\ndf=dx D 0:\nMaybe Richard Feynman said it best. He showed his friends a plastic curve that\nwas made in a special way--\"no matter how you turn it, the tangent at the lowest\npoint is horizontal.\" They checked it out. It was true.\nSurely You're Joking, Mr.\nFeynman! is\na\ngood book (but\nrough on\nmathematicians).\nEXAMPLE 3 (continued)\nLook back at Figure 3.3b. The points that stand out\nare not the \"ups\" or \"downs\" but the \"turns.\" Those are stationary points, where\ndf=dx D 0: We see two maxima and two minima. None of them are absolute\nmaxima or minima, because f .x/ starts at\n8 and ends at C8:\n\n3.2\nMaximum and Minimum Problems\nEXAMPLE 4\nf .x/ D 4x3\n3x4 has slope 12x2\n12x3: That derivative is zero\nwhen x2 equals x3, at the two points x D 0 and x D 1: To decide between minimum\nand maximum (local or absolute), the first step is to evaluate f .x/ at these stationary\npoints. We find f .0/ D 0 and f .1/ D 1:\nNow look at large x: The function goes down to\n8 in both directions. (You can\nmentally substitute x D 1000 and x D\n1000). For large x;\n3x4 dominates 4x3:\nConclusion f D 1 is an absolute maximum. f D 0 is not a maximum or minimum\n(local or absolute). We have to recognize this exceptional possibility, that a curve (or a\ncar) can pause for an instant .f\n1 D 0/ and continue in the same direction. The reason\nis the \"double zero\" in 12x2\n12x3, from its double factor x2:\nFig. 3.4\nThe graphs of 4x3\n3x4 and x Cx\n1: Check rough points and endpoints.\nEXAMPLE 5\nDefine f .x/ D x Cx\n1 for x\n¡ 0: Its derivative 1\n1=x2 is zero at\nx D 1: At that point f .1/ D 2 is the minimum value. Every combination like 1\n3 C3\nor 2\n3 C 3\n2 is larger than fmin D 2: Figure 3.4 shows that the maximum of x Cx\n1 is\nC8:\nImportant The maximum always occurs at a stationary point (where df=dx D 0)\nor a rough point (no derivative) or an endpoint of the domain. These are the three\ntypes of critical points. All maxima and minima occur at critical points! At every\nother point df=dx\n¡ 0 or df=dx\n0: Here is the procedure:\n1. Solve df=dx D 0 to find the stationary points f .x/:\n2. Compute f .x/ at every critical point--stationary point, rough point,\nendpoint.\n3. Take the maximum and minimum of those critical values of f .x/:\nEXAMPLE 6\n(Absolute value f .x/ D\n|x\n|) The minimum is zero at a rough point.\nThe maximum is at an endpoint. There are no stationary points.\nThe derivative of y D\n|x\n| is never zero. Figure 3.4 shows the maximum and\nminimum on the interval Œ 3;2: This is typical of piecewise linear functions.\nQuestion Could the minimum be zero when the function never reaches f .x/ D 0?\nAnswer\nYes, f .x/ D 1=.1Cx/2 approaches but never reaches zero as x\nN\n8:\nA good word is approach when f .x/\nN\n8: Infinity is not reached. But I still say \"the\nmaximum is\n8:\"\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nRemark 1\nx\nN\n8 and f .x/\nN\n8 are avoided when f is continuous on a\nclosed interval a\n¤ x\n¤ b: Then f .x/ reaches its maximum and its minimum\n(Extreme Value Theorem). But x\nN\n8 and f .x/\nN\n8 are too important to rule out.\nYou test x\nN\n8 by considering large x: You recognize f .x/\nN\n8 by going above\nevery finite value.\nRemark 2\nNote the difference between critical points (specified by x) and critical\nvalues (specified by f .x/). The example x Cx\n1 had the minimum point x D 1 and\nthe minimum value f .1/ D 2:\nMAXIMUM AND MINIMUM IN APPLICATIONS\nTo find a maximum or minimum, solve f\n1.x/ D 0: The slope is zero at the top and\nbottom of the graph. The idea is clear--and then check rough points and endpoints.\nBut to be honest, that is not where the problem starts.\nIn a real application, the first step (often the hardest) is to choose the unknown\nand find the function. It is we ourselves who decide on x and f .x/: The equation\ndf=dx D 0 comes in the middle of the problem, not at the beginning. I will start on a\nnew example, with a question instead of a function.\nEXAMPLE 7\nWhere should you get onto an expressway for minimum driving time,\nif the expressway speed is 60 mph and ordinary driving speed is 30 mph?\nI know this problem well--it comes up every morning. The Mass Pike goes to MIT\nand I have to join it somewhere. There is an entrance near Route 128 and another\nentrance further in. I used to take the second one, now I take the first. Mathematics\nshould decide which is faster--some mornings I think they are maxima.\nMost models are simplified, to focus on the key idea. We will allow the expressway\nto be entered at any point x (Figure 3.5). Instead of two entrances (a discrete problem)\nwe have a continuous choice (a calculus problem). The trip has two parts, at speeds\n30 and 60:\na distance\n?\na2 Cx2 up to the expressway, in\n?\na2 Cx2=30 hours\na distance b\nx on the expressway, in .b\nx/=60 hours\nProblem Minimize f .x/ D total time D 1\n?\na2 Cx2 C 1\n60.b\nx/:\nWe have the function f .x/: Now comes calculus. The first term uses the power rule:\nThe derivative of u1=2 is 1\n2u\n1=2 du=dx: Here u D a2Cx2 has du=dx D 2x:\nf\n1.x/ D 1\n2.a2 Cx2/\n1=2.2x/\n60:\n(1)\nTo solve f\n1.x/ D 0, multiply by 60 and square both sides:\n.a2 Cx2/\n1=2.2x/ D 1\ngives\n2x D .a2Cx2/1=2\nand\n4x2 D a2Cx2: (2)\nThus 3x2 D a2: This yields two candidates, x D a=\n?\n3 and x D\na=\n?\n3: But a\nnegative x would mean useless driving on the expressway. In fact f\n1 is not zero\nat x D\na=\n?\n3: That false root entered when we squared 2x:\n\n3.2\nMaximum and Minimum Problems\nFig. 3.5\nJoin the freeway at x--minimize the driving time f .x/:\nI notice something surprising. The stationary point x D a=\n?\n3 does not depend on\nb: The total time includes the constant b=60, which disappeared in df=dx: Somehow\nb must enter the answer, and this is a warning to go carefully. The minimum might\noccur at a rough point or an endpoint. Those are the other critical points of f , and\nour drawing may not be realistic. Certainly we expect x\n¤ b, or we are entering the\nexpressway beyond MIT.\nContinue with calculus. Compute the driving time f .x/ for an entrance at\nx\nD a=\n?\n3:\nf .x/ D 1\na\na2 C.a2=3/C 1\n\nb\na\n?\n\nD\n?\n3a\n60 C b\n60 D f\n:\nThe square root of 4a2=3 is 2a=\n?\n3: We combined 2=30\n1=60 D 3=60and divided\nby\n?\n3: Is this stationary value f\na minimum? You must look also at endpoints:\nenter at x D 0: travel time is a=30Cb=60 D f\n\nenter at x D b: travel time is\n?\na2 Cb2=30 D f\n:\nThe comparison f\n\nf\nshould be automatic. Entering at x D 0 was a candidate\nand calculus didn't choose it. The derivative is not zero at x D 0: It is not smart to\ngo perpendicular to the expressway.\nThe second comparison has x D b: We drive directly to MIT at speed 30: This\noption has to be taken seriously. In fact it is optimal when b is small or a is large.\nThis choice x D b can arise mathematically in two ways. If all entrances are\nbetween 0 and b, then b is an endpoint. If we can enter beyond MIT, then b is a\nrough point. The graph in Figure 3.5c has a corner at x D b, where the derivative\njumps. The reason is that distance on the expressway is the absolute value\n|b\nx\n|--\nnever negative.\nEither way x D b is a critical point. The optimal x is the smaller of a=\n?\nand b.\nif a=\n?\n¤ b W stationary point wins, enter at x D a=\n?\n3; total time f\n\nif a=\n?\n¥ b W no stationary point, drive directly to MIT, time f\n\nThe heart of this subject is in \"word problems.\" All the calculus is in a few lines,\ncomputing f\n1 and solving f\n1.x/ D 0: The formulation took longer. Step 1 usually\ndoes:\n1. Express the quantity to be minimized or maximized as a function f .x/:\nThe variable x has to be selected.\n\nApplications of the Derivative\n2. Compute f\n1.x/, solve f\n1.x/ D 0, check critical points for fmin and fmax:\nA picture of the problem (and the graph of f .x/) makes all the difference.\nEXAMPLE 7 (continued)\nChoose x as an angle instead of a distance. Figure 3.6\nshows the triangle with angle x and side a: The driving distance to the expressway\nis asec x: The distance on the expressway is b\natan x: Dividing by the speeds 30\nand 60, the driving time has a nice form:\nf .x/ D total time D a sec x\nC b\na tan x\n:\n(3)\nThe derivatives of sec x and tan x go into df=dx:\ndf\ndx D a\n30 sec x tan x\na\n60sec2x:\n(4)\nNow set df=dx D 0, divide by a, and multiply by 30cos2x:\nsin x D 1\n2:\n(5)\nThis answer is beautiful. The angle x is 30\n! That optimal angle (=6 radians)\nhas sin x D 1\n2: The triangle with side a and hypotenuse a=\n?\n3 is a 30-60-90 right\ntriangle.\nI don't know whether you prefer\n?\na2 Cx2 or trigonometry. The minimum is\nexactly as before--either at 30\nor going directly to MIT.\nFig. 3.6\n(a) Driving at angle x: (b) Energies of spring and mass. (c) Profit D income\ncost.\nEXAMPLE 8\nIn mechanics, nature chooses minimum energy. A spring is pulled\ndown by a mass, the energy is f .x/, and df=dx D 0 gives equilibrium. It is a\nphilosophical question why so many laws of physics involve minimum energy or\nminimum time--which makes the mathematics easy.\nThe energy has two terms--for the spring and the mass. The spring energy is\n2kx2--positive in stretching (x\n¡ 0 is downward) and also positive in compression\n.x\n0/: The potential energy of the mass is taken as\nmx--decreasing as the mass\ngoes down. The balance is at the minimum of f .x/ D 1\n2kx2\nmx:\nI apologize for giving you such a small problem, but it makes a crucial point.\nWhen f .x/ is quadratic, the equilibrium equation df=dx D 0 is linear.\ndf=dx D kx\nm D 0:\nGraphically, x D m=k is at the bottom of the parabola. Physically, kx D m is a\nbalance of forces--the spring force against the weight. Hooke's law for the spring\nforce is elastic constant k times displacement x:\n\n3.2\nMaximum and Minimum Problems\nEXAMPLE 9\nDerivative of cost D marginal cost (our first management\nexample).\nThe paper to print x copies of this book might cost C D 1000C3x dollars. The\nderivative is dC=dx D 3: This is the marginal cost of paper for each additional book.\nIf x increases by one book, the cost C increases by $3: The marginal cost is like the\nvelocity and the total cost is like the distance.\nMarginal cost is in dollars per book. Total cost is in dollars. On the plus\nside, the income is I.x/ and the marginal income is dI=dx: To apply calculus, we\noverlook the restriction to whole numbers.\nSuppose the number of books increases by dx: The cost goes up by\n.dC=dx/dx: The income goes up by .dI=dx/dx: If we skip all other costs, then\nprofit P.x/ D income I.x/ cost C.x/. In most cases P increases to a maximum\nand falls back.\nAt the high point on the profit curve, the marginal profit is zero:\ndP=dx D 0\nor\ndI=dx D dC=dx:\n(6)\nProfit is maximized when marginal income I\n1 equals marginal cost C\n1.\nThis basic rule of economics comes directly from calculus, and we give an example:\nC.x/Dcost of x advertisements D 900C400x\nx2\nsetup cost 900, print cost 400x; volume savings x2\nI.x/Dincome due to x advertisements D 600x\n6x2\nsales 600 per advertisement, subtract 6x2 for diminishing returns\noptimal decision dC=dx D dI=dx\nor\n2x D 600\n12x\nor\nx D 20\nprofit D income costD 9600\n8500 D 1100:\nThe next section shows how to verify that this profit is a maximum not a minimum.\nThe first exercises ask you to solve df=dx D 0: Later exercises also look\nfor f .x/:\n3.2\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nIf df =dx\n¡ 0 in an interval then f .x/ is\na\n.

When dy=dx is negative, y.x/ is\ndecreasing. That is clear, but what about the second derivative? From looking at the\ncurve, can you decide the sign of f\n2.x/ or d 2y=dx2? The answer is yes and the key\nis in the bending.\nA straight line doesn't bend. The slope of y D mx Cb is m(a constant). The second\nderivative is zero. We have to go to curves, to see a changing slope. Changes in the\nderivative show up in f\n2.x/:\nf D x2 has f\n1 D 2x and f\n2 D 2 (this parabola bends up)\ny D sin x has dy=dx D cos x and d 2y=dx2 D\nsin x (the sine bends down)\nThe slope 2x gets larger even when the parabola is falling. The sign of f or f\n1 is\nnot revealed by f\n2: The second derivative tells about change in slope.\nA function with f\n2.x/\n¡ 0 is concave up. It bends upward as the slope increases.\nIt is also called convex. A function with decreasing slope--this means f\n2.x/\n0--is\nconcave down. Note how cos x and 1Ccos x and even 1C 1\n2x Ccos x change from\nconcave down to concave up at x D =2: At that point f\n2 D\ncos x changes from\nnegative to positive. The extra 1C 1\n2x tilts the graph but the bending is the same.\nFig. 3.7\nIncreasing slope D concave up .f\n¡ 0/: Concave down is f\n0: Inflection point f\n2 D 0\nHere is another way to see the sign of f\n2: Watch the tangent lines.When the\ncurve is concave up, the tangent stays below it. A linear approximation is too low.\nThis section computes a quadratic approximation--which includes the term with\nf\n¡0: When the curve bends down .f\n0/, the opposite happens--the tangent\nlines are above the curve. The linear approximation is too high, and f\n2 lowers it.\nIn physical motion, f\n2.t/ is the acceleration--in units of distance=.time/2:\nAcceleration is rate of change of velocity. The oscillation sin 2t has v D 2cos 2t\n(maximum speed 2) and a D\n4sin 2t (maximum acceleration 4).\nAn increasing population means f\n¡ 0: An increasing growth rate means\nf\n¡ 0. Those are different. The rate can slow down while the growth continues.\nMAXIMUM VS. MINIMUM\nRemember that f\n1.x/ D 0 locates a stationary point. That may be a minimum or\na maximum. The second derivative decides! Instead of computing f .x/ at many\npoints, we compute f\n2.x/ at one point--the stationary point. It is a minimum if\nf\n2.x/\n¡ 0:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\n3D When f\n1.x/ D 0 and f\n2.x/\n¡ 0, there is a local minimum at x:\nWhen f\n1.x/ D 0 and f\n2.x/\n0, there is a local maximum at x:\nTo the left of a minimum, the curve is falling. After the minimum, the curve rises. The\nslope has changed from negative to positive. The graph bends upward and f\n2.x/\n¡ 0:\nAt a maximum the slope drops from positive to negative. In the exceptional case,\nwhen f\n1.x/ D 0 and also f\n2.x/ D 0, anything can happen. An example is x3, which\npauses at x D 0 and continues up (its slope is 3x2\n¥ 0). However x4 pauses and goes\ndown (with a very flat graph).\nWe emphasize that the information from f\n1.x/ and f\n2.x/ is only \"local.\" To be\ncertain of an absolute minimum or maximum, we need information over the whole\ndomain.\nEXAMPLE 1\nf .x/ D x3\nx2\nhas\nf\n1.x/ D 3x2\n2x\nand\nf\n2.x/ D 6x\n2:\nTo find the maximum and=or minimum, solve 3x2\n2x D 0: The stationary points\nare x D 0 and x D 2\n3 . At those points we need the second derivative. It is f\n2.0/ D\n(local maximum) and f\n2 2\n\nD C2 (local minimum).\nBetween the maximum and minimum is the inflection point. That is where\nf\n2.x/ D 0. The curve changes from concave down to concave up. This example has\nf\n2 D 6x\n2, so the inflection point is at x D 1\n3:\nINFLECTION POINTS\nIn mathematics it is a special event when a function passes through zero. When the\nfunction is f , its graph crosses the axis. When the function is f\n1, the tangent line is\nhorizontal. When f\n2 goes through zero, we have an inflection point.\nThe direction of bending changes at an inflection point. Your eye picks that out\nin a graph. For an instant the graph is straight (straight lines have f\n2 D 0). It is easy\nto see crossing points and stationary points and inflection points. Very few people can\nrecognize where f\n3 D 0 or f\n4 D 0: I am not sure if those points have names.\nThere is a genuine maximum or minimum when f\n1.x/ changes sign. Similarly,\nthere is a genuine inflection point when f\n2.x/ changes sign. The graph is concave\ndown on one side of an inflection point and concave up on the other side.\nThe tangents are above the curve on one side and below it on the other side. At an\ninflection point, the tangent line crosses the curve (Figure 3.7b).\nNotice that a parabola y D ax2 Cbx Cc has no inflection points: y\n2 is constant.\nA cubic curve has one inflection point, because f\n2 is linear. A fourth-degree curve\nmight or might not have inflection points--the quadratic f\n2.x/ might or might not\ncross the axis.\nEXAMPLE 2\nx4\n2x2 is W-shaped, 4x3\n4x has two bumps, 12x2\n4 is U-shaped.\nThe table shows the signs at the important values of x:\nx\n\n?\n1=\n?\n1=\n?\n?\nf .x/\n\n0;0\n\nf\n1.x/\nC\n\nf\n2.x/\n\nThat rules out f .x/ D x4, which has f\n2 D 12x2\n¡ 0 on both sides of zero. Its tangent line\nis the x axis. The line stays below the graph--so no inflection point\n\n3.3\nSecond Derivatives: Bending and Acceleration\nBetween zeros of f .x/ come zeros of f\n1.x/ (stationary points). Between zeros of\nf\n1.x/ come zeros of f\n2.x/ (inflection points). In this example f .x/ has a double\nzero at the origin, so a single zero of f\n1 is caught there. It is a local maximum, since\nf\n2.0/\n0:\nInflection points are important--not just for mathematics. We know the world\npopulation will keep rising. We don't know if the rate of growth will slow down.\nRemember: The rate of growth stops growing at the inflection point. Here is the\n1990 report of the UN Population Fund.\nThe next ten years will decide whether the world population trebles or merely\ndoubles before it finally stops growing. This may decide the future of the earth as a\nhabitation for humans. The population, now 5:3 billion, is increasing by a quarter\nof a million every day. Between 90 and 100 million people will be added every\nyear during the 1990s; a billion people--a whole China--over the decade. The\nfastest growth will come in the poorest countries.\nA few years ago it seemed as if the rate of population growth was slowing\neverywhere except in Africa and parts of South Asia. The world's population\nseemed set to stabilize around 10:2 billion towards the end of the next century.\nToday, the situation looks less promising. The world has overshot the marker\npoints of the 1984 \"most likely\" medium projection. It is now on course for an\neventual total that will be closer to 11 billion than to 10 billion.\nIf fertility reductions continue to be slower than projected, the mark could be\nmissed again. In that case the world could be headed towards a total of up to 14\nbillion people.\nStarting with a census, the UN follows each age group in each country. They\nestimate the death rate and fertility rate--the medium estimates are published. This\nreport is saying that we are not on track with the estimate.\nSection 6.5 will come back to population, with an equation that predicts 10 billion.\nIt assumes we are now at the inflection point. But China's second census just started\non July 1, 1990: When it's finished we will know if the inflection point is still ahead.\nYou now understand the meaning of f\n2.x/:Its sign gives the direction of bending--\nthe change in the slope. The rest of this section computes how much the curve\nbends--using the size of f\n2 and not just its sign. We find quadratic approximations\nbased on f\n2.x/: In some courses they are optional--the main points are highlighted.\nCENTERED DIFFERENCES AND SECOND DIFFERENCES\nCalculus begins with average velocities, computed on either side of x:\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/\nx\nand\nf .x/\nf .x\nx/\nx\nare close to f\n1.x/\n(1)\nWe never mentioned it, but a better approximation to f\n1.x/ comes from averaging\nthose two averages. This produces a centered difference, which is based on x Cx\nand x\nx: It divides by 2x:\nf\n1.x/\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/\nx\nC f .x/\nf .x\nx/\nx\n\nD f .x Cx/\nf .x\nx/\n2x\n:\n(2)\nWe claim this is better. The test is to try it on powers of x:\nThe United Nations watches the second derivative!\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nFor f .x/ D x these ratios all give f\n1 D 1 (exactly). For f .x/ D x2, only the\ncentered difference correctly gives f\n1 D 2x: The one-sided ratio gave 2x Cx\n(in Chapter 1 it was 2t Ch). It is only \"first-order accurate.\" But centering leaves no\nerror. We are averaging 2x Cx with 2x\nx: Thus the centered difference\nis \"second-order accurate.\"\nI ask now: What ratio converges to the second derivative? One answer is to take\ndifferences of the first derivative. Certainly f\n1=x approaches f\n2: But we want\na ratio involving f itself. A natural idea is to take differences of differences, which\nbrings us to \"second differences\":\nf .x Cx/\nf .x/\nx\nf .x/\nf .x\nx/\nx\nx\nD f .x Cx/\n2f .x/Cf .x\nx/\n.x/2\nN d 2f\ndx2 : (3)\nOn the top, the difference of the difference is .f / D 2f: It corresponds to d 2f:\nOn the bottom, .x/2 corresponds to dx2 . This explains the way we place the 2's in\nd 2f=dx2: To say it differently:dx is squared, df is not squared--as in distance=.time/2:\nNote that .x/2 becomes much smaller than x: If we divide f by .x/2, the\nratio blows up. It is the extra cancellation in the second difference 2f that allows\nthe limit to exist. That limit is f\n2.x/:\nApplication The great majority of equations can't be solved exactly. A typical case\nis f\n2.x/ D\nsinf .x/ (the pendulum equation). To compute a solution, I would\nreplace f\n2.x/ by the second difference in equation (3). Approximations at points\nspaced by x are a very large part of scientific computing.\nTo test the accuracy of these differences, here is an experiment on f .x/ D\nsin x Ccos x: The table shows the errors at x D 0 from formulas .1/, .2/, .3/:\nstep length x\none-sided errors\ncentered errors\nsecond difference errors\n1=4\n.1347\n.0104\n:0052\n1=8\n.0650\n.0026\n:0013\n1=16\n.0319\n.0007\n:0003\n1=32\n.0158\n.0002\n:0001\nThe one-sided errors are cut in half when x is cut in half. The other columns\ndecrease like .x/2: Each reduction divides those errors by 4. The errors from\none-sided differences are O.x/ and the errors from centered differences are\nO.x/2.\nThe \"big O\" notation When the errors are of order x, we write E D O.x/:\nThis means that E\n¤ Cx for some constant C: We don't compute C --in fact we\ndon't want to deal with it. The statement \"one-sided errors are Oh of delta x\" captures\nwhat is important. The main point of the other columns is E D O.x/2 .\nLINEAR APPROXIMATION VS. QUADRATIC APPROXIMATION\nThe second derivative gives a tremendous improvement over linear approximation\nf .a/Cf\n1.a/.x\na/: A tangent line starts out close to the curve, but the line has\nno way to bend. After a while it overshoots or undershoots the true function (see\nFigure 3.8). That is especially clear for the model f .x/ D x2, when the tangent is the\nx axis and the parabola curves upward.\n\n3.3\nSecond Derivatives: Bending and Acceleration\nYou can almost guess the term with bending.It should involve f\n2, and also .x/2:\nIt might be exactly f\n2.x/ times .x/2 but it is not. The model function x2 has\nf\n2 D 2: There must be a factor 1\n2 to cancel that 2:\n3E The quadratic approximation to a smooth function f .x/ near x D a is\nf .x/\nf .a/Cf\n1.a/.x\na/C 1\n2f\n2.a/.x\na/2:\n(4)\nAt the basepoint this is f .a/ D f .a/: The derivatives also agree at x D a: Further-\nmore the second derivatives agree. On both sides of .4/, the second derivative at\nx D a is f\n2.a/:\nThe quadratic approximation bends with the function. It is not the absolutely\nfinal word, because there is a cubic term 1\n6f\n3.a/.x\na/3 and a fourth-degree term\n24f\n4.a/.x\na/4 and so on. The whole infinite sum is a \"Taylor series.\" Equation (4)\ncarries that series through the quadratic term--which for practical purposes gives a\nterrific approximation. You will see that in numerical experiments.\nTwo things to mention. First, equation (4) shows why f\n¡ 0 brings the curve\nabove the tangent line. The linear part gives the line, while the quadratic part is\npositive and bends upward. Second, equation (4) comes from .2/ and .3/: Where\none-sided differences give f .x Cx/\nf .x/Cf\n1.x/x, centered differences\ngive the quadratic:\nfrom.2/ W\nf .x Cx/\nf .x\nx/C2f\n1.x/x\nfrom.3/ W\nf .x Cx/\n2f .x/\nf .x\nx/Cf\n2.x/.x/2:\nAdd and divide by 2: The result is f .x Cx/\nf .x/Cf\n1.x/x C 1\n2f\n2.x/.x/2:\nThis is correct through .x/2 and misses by .x/3, as examples show:\nFig. 3.8\nEXAMPLE 3\n.x Cx/3\n.x3/C.3x2/.x/C 1\n2.6x/.x/2Cerror.x/3:\nEXAMPLE 4\n.1Cx/n\n1Cnx C 1\n2n.n\n1/x2:\nThe first derivative at x D 0 is n: The second derivative is n.n\n1/: The cubic term\nwould be 1\n6n.n\nl/.n\n2/x3: We are just producing the binomial expansion!\nEXAMPLE 5\nx\n1Cx Cx2 D start of a geometric series.\n1=.1\nx/ has derivative 1=.1\nx/2: Its second derivative is 2=.1\nx/3: At x D 0\nthose equal 1;1;2: The factor 1\n2 cancels the 2, which leaves 1;1;1: This explains\n1Cx Cx2:\nThe next terms are x3 and x4: The whole series is 1=.1\nx/ D 1Cx Cx2Cx3 C\n\n:\nNumerical experiment\n1=\n?\n1Cx\n2x C 3\n8x2 is tested for accuracy.\nDividing x by 2 almost divides the error by 8: If we only keep the linear part 1\n2x,\nthe error is only divided by 4: Here are the errors at x D 1\n4; 1\n8 and 1\n16:\nlinear approximation\n\nerror\n8x2\n\nW\n:0194\n:0053\n:0014\nquadratic approximation\n\nerror\n\n16 x3\n\nW\n:00401\n:00055\n:00007\n\nApplications of the Derivative\n3.3\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe direction of bending is given by the sign of\na\n.

Everything is there, but you have to\nknow what to look for. One way to learn is by sketching graphs yourself, and in the\npast that was almost the only way. Now it is obsolete to spend weeks drawing curves--\na computer or graphing calculator does it faster and better. That doesn't remove the\nneed to appreciate a graph (or a painting), since a curve displays a tremendous amount\nof information.\nThis section combines two approaches. One is to study actual machine-produced\ngraphs (especially electrocardiograms). The other is to understand the mathematics of\ngraphs--slope, concavity, asymptotes, shifts, and scaling. We introduce the centering\ntransform and zoom transform. These two approaches are like the rest of calculus,\nwhere special derivatives and integrals are done by hand and day-to-day applications\nare by computer. Both are essential--the machine can do experiments that we could\nnever do. But without the mathematics our instructions miss the point. To create good\ngraphs you have to know a few of them personally.\nREADING AN ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG or EKG)\nThe graphs of an ECG show the electrical potential during a heartbeat. There are\ntwelve graphs--six from leads attached to the chest, and six from leads to the arms\nand left leg. (It doesn't hurt, but everybody is nervous. You have to lie still, because\ncontraction of other muscles will mask the reading from the heart.) The graphs record\nelectrical impulses, as the cells depolarize and the heart contracts.\nWhat can I explain in two pages? The graph shows the fundamental pattern of the\nECG. Note the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. Those patterns, seen\ndifferently in the twelve graphs, tell whether the heart is normal or out of rhythm--or\nsuffering an infarction (a heart attack).\nFirst of all the graphs show the heart rate. The dark vertical lines are by convention\n5 second apart. The light lines are 1\n25 second apart. If the heart beats every 1\n5 second\n(one dark line) the rate is 5 beats per second or 300 per minute. That is extreme\ntachycardia--not compatible with life. The normal rate is between three dark lines\nper beat ( 3\n5 second, or 100 beats per minute) and five dark lines (one second between\nbeats, 60 per minute). A baby has a faster rate, over 100 per minute. In this figure the\nrate is\n: A rate below 60 is bradycardia, not in itself dangerous. For a resting\nathlete that is normal.\nDoctors memorize the six rates 300;150;100;75;60;50:Those correspond to 1;2;\n3;4;5;6 dark lines between heartbeats. The distance is easiest to measure between\nspikes (the peaks of the R wave). Many doctors put a printed scale next to the chart.\nOne textbook emphasizes that \"Where the next wave falls determines the rate. No\nmathematical computation is necessary.\" But you see where those numbers come\nfrom.\n\n3.4\nGraphs\nThe next thing to look for is heart rhythm. The regular rhythm is set by the\npacemaker, which produces the P wave. A constant distance between waves is good--\nand then each beat is examined. When there is a block in the pathway, it shows as a\ndelay in the graph. Sometimes the pacemaker fires irregularly. Figure 3.10 shows\nsinus arrythmia (fairly normal). The time between peaks is changing. In disease or\nemergency, there are potential pacemakers in all parts of the heart.\nI should have pointed out the main parts. We have four chambers, an atrium\nventricle pair on the left and right. The SA node should be the pacemaker. The\nstimulus spreads from the atria to the ventricles-- from the small chambers that \"prime\nthe pump\" to the powerful chambers that drive blood through the body. The P wave\ncomes with contraction of the atria. There is a pause of\n10 second at the AV node.\nThen the big QRS wave starts contraction of the ventricles, and the T wave is when\nthe ventricles relax. The cells switch back to negative charge and the heart cycle is\ncomplete.\nFig. 3.9\nHappy person with a heart and a normal electrocardiogram.\nThe ECG shows when the pacemaker goes wrong. Other pacemakers take over--\nthe AV node will pace at 60=minute: An early firing in the ventricle can give a wide\nspike in the QRS complex, followed by a long pause. The impulses travel by a slow\npath. Also the pacemaker can suddenly speed up (paroxysmal tachycardia is\n250=minute). But the most critical danger is fibrillation.\nFigure 3.10b shows a dying heart. The ECG indicates irregular contractions--no\nnormal PQRST sequence at all. What kind of heart would generate such a rhythm?\nThe muscles are quivering or \"fibrillating\" independently. The pumping action is\nnearly gone, which means emergency care. The patient needs immediate CPR--\nsomeone to do the pumping that the heart can't do. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation\nis a combination of chest pressure and air pressure (hand and mouth) to restart the\nrhythm. CPR can be done on the street. A hospital applies a defibrillator, which shocks\nthe heart back to life. It depolarizes all the heart cells, so the timing can be reset. Then\nthe charge spreads normally from SA node to atria to AV node to ventricles.\nThis discussion has not used all twelve graphs to locate the problem. That needs\nvectors. Look ahead at Section 11.1 for the heart vector, and especially at Section 11.2\nfor its twelve projections. Those readings distinguish between atrium and ventricle,\nleft and right, forward and back. This information is of vital importance in the event\nof a heart attack. A \"heart attack\" is a myocardial infarction (MI).\nAn MI occurs when part of an artery to the heart is blocked (a coronary occlusion).\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nFig. 3.10\nDoubtful rhythm. Serious fibrillation. Signals of a heart attack.\nAn area is without blood supply--therefore without oxygen or glucose. Often the\nattack is in the thick left ventricle, which needs the most blood. The cells are first\nischemic, then injured, and finally infarcted (dead). The classical ECG signals involve\nthose three I's:\nIschemia: Reduced blood supply, upside-down T wave in the chest leads.\nInjury: An elevated segment between S and T means a recent attack.\nInfarction: The Q wave, normally a tiny dip or absent, is as wide as a small\nsquare ( 1\n25 second). It may occupy a third of the entire QRS complex.\nThe Q wave gives the diagnosis. You can find all three I's in Figure 3.10c.\nIt is absolutely amazing how much a good graph can do.\nTHE MECHANICS OF GRAPHS\nFrom the meaning of graphs we descend to the mechanics. A formula is now given for\nf .x/: The problem is to create the graph. It would be too old-fashioned to evaluate\nf .x/ by hand and draw a curve through a dozen points. A computer has a much better\nidea of a parabola than an artist (who tends to make it asymptotic to a straight line).\nThere are some things a computer knows, and other things an artist knows, and still\nothers that you and I know--because we understand derivatives.\nOur job is to apply calculus. We extract information from f\n1 and f\n2 as well as f:\nSmall movements in the graph may go unnoticed, but the important properties come\nthrough. Here are the main tests:\n1. The sign of f .x/\n(above or below axis: f D 0 at crossing point)\n2. The sign of f\n1.x/\n(increasing or decreasing: f\n1 D 0 at stationary point)\n3. The sign of f\n2.x/\n(concave up or down: f\n2 D 0 at injection point)\n4. The behavior of f .x/ as x\nN\n8 and x\nN\n5. The points at which f .x/\nN\n8 or f .x/\nN\n6. Even or odd?\nPeriodic?\nJumps in f or f\n1?\nEndpoints?\nf .0/?\nEXAMPLE 1\nf .x/ D\nx2\nx2\nf\n1.x/ D\n2x\n.1\nx2/2\nf\n2.x/ D 2C6x2\n.1\nx2/3\nThe sign of f .x/ depends on 1\nx2: Thus f .x/\n¡ 0 in the inner interval where\nx2\n1: The graph bends upwards (f\n2.x/\n¡ 0) in that same interval. There are no\ninflection points, since f\n2 is never zero. The stationary point where f\n1 vanishes is\nx D 0: We have a local minimum at x D 0:\nThe guidelines (or asymptotes) meet the graph at infinity. For large x the important\nterms are x2 and\nx2: Their ratio is Cx2=\nx2 D\n1--which is the limit as x\nN\n8, and x\nN\n8: The horizontal asymptote is the line y D\n1.\nThe other infinities, where f blows up, occur when 1\nx2 is zero. That happens at\nx D 1 and x D\n1: The vertical asymptotes are the lines x D 1 and x D\n1. The\n\n3.4\nGraphs\ngraph in Figure 3.11a approaches those lines.\nif f .x/\nN b as x\nN\n8 or\n8, the line y D b is a horizontal asymptote\nif f .x/\nN C8 or\n8 as x\nN a, the line x D a is a vertical asymptote\nif f .x/\n.mx Cb/\nN 0 as x\nN C8 or\nN\n8, the line y D mx Cb is a sloping asymptote.\nFinally comes the vital fact that this function is even: f .x/ D f . x/ because\nsquaring x obliterates the sign. The graph is symmetric across the y axis.\nTo summarize the effect of dividing by 1\nx2: No effect near x D 0: Blowup at 1\nand\n1 from zero in the denominator. The function approaches\n1 as\n|x\n|\nN\n8:\nEXAMPLE 2\nf .x/ D\nx2\nx\nf\n1 D x2\n2x\n.x\n1/2\nf\n2 D\n.x\n1/3\nThis example divides by x\n1: Therefore x D 1 is a vertical asymptote, where f .x/\nbecomes infinite. Vertical asymptotes come mostly from zero denominators.\nLook beyond x D 1: Both f .x/ and f\n2.x/ are positive for x\n¡ 1: The slope is\nzero at x D 2: That must be a local minimum.\nWhat happens as x\nN\n8 ? Dividing x2 by x\n1, the leading term is x: The\nfunction becomes large. It grows linearly--we expect a sloping asymptote. To find\nit, do the division properly:\nx2\nx\n1 D x C1C\nx\n1:\n(1)\nThe last term goes to zero. The function approaches y D x C1 as the asymptote.\nThis function is not odd or even. Its graph is in Figure 3.11b. With zoom out you\nsee the asymptotes. Zoom in for f D 0 or f\n1 D 0 or f\n2 D 0:\nFig. 3.11\nThe graphs of x2=.1\nx2/ and x2=.x\n1/ and sin x C 1\n3 sin 3x:\nEXAMPLE 3\nf .x/ D sin x C 1\n3 sin 3x\nhas the slope\nf\n1.x/ D cos x Ccos 3x:\nAbove all these functions are periodic. If x increases by 2, nothing changes. The\ngraphs from 2 to 4 are repetitions of the graphs from 0 to 2: Thus f .x C2/ D\nf .x/ and the period is 2: Any interval of length 2 will show a complete picture,\nand Figure 3.11c picks the interval from\nto :\nThe second outstanding property is that f is odd. The sine functions satisfy\nf . x/ D\nf .x/: The graph is symmetric through the origin. By reflecting the right\nhalf through the origin, you get the left half. In contrast, the cosines in f\n1.x/ are even.\nTo find the zeros of f .x/ and f\n1.x/ and f\n2.x/, rewrite those functions as\nf .x/ D 2 sin x\n3 sin3x\nf\n1.x/ D\n2 cos x C4cos3x\nf\n2.x/ D\n10 sin x C12sin3x:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nWe changed sin 3x to 3 sin x\n4sin3x: For the derivatives use sin2x D 1\ncos2x:\nNow find the zeros--the crossing points, stationary points, and inflection points:\nf D 0\n2 sin x D 4\n3 sin3x\nn sin x D 0 or sin2x D 3\nn x D 0;\n\nf\n1 D 0\n2 cos x D 4 cos3x\nn cos x D 0 or cos2x D 1\nn x D\n=4;\n=2;\n3=4\nf\n2 D 0\n5 sin x D 6 sin3x\nn sin x D 0 or sin2x D 5\nn x D 0;\n;\n;\n\nThat is more than enough information to sketch the graph. The stationary points\n=4;=2;3=4 are evenly spaced. At those points f .x/ is\n?\n8=3 (maximum), 2=3\n(local minimum),\n?\n8=3 (maximum). Figure 3.11c shows the graph.\nI would like to mention a beautiful continuation of this same pattern:\nf .x/ D sin x C 1\n3 sin 3x C 1\n5 sin 5x C\n\nf\n1.x/ D cos x Ccos 3x Ccos 5x C\n\nIf we stop after ten terms, f .x/ is extremely close to a step function. If we don't\nstop, the exact step function contains infinitely many sines. It jumps from\n=4 to\nC=4 as x goes past zero. More precisely it is a \"square wave,\" because the graph\njumps back down at and repeats. The slope cos x Ccos 3x C\n\nalso has period\n2: Infinitely many cosines add up to a delta function! (The slope at the jump is an\ninfinite spike.) These sums of sines and cosines are Fourier series.\nGRAPHS BY COMPUTERS AND CALCULATORS\nWe have come to a topic of prime importance. If you have graphing software for\na computer, or if you have a graphing calculator, you can bring calculus to life. A\ngraph presents y.x/ in a new way--different from the formula. Information that is\nburied in the formula is clear on the graph. But don't throw away y.x/ and dy=dx.\nThe derivative is far from obsolete.\nThese pages discuss how calculus and graphs go together. We work on a crucial\nproblem of applied mathematics--to find where y.x/ reaches its minimum. There is\nno need to tell you a hundred applications. Begin with the formula. How do you find\nthe point x\nwhere y.x/ is smallest ?\nFirst, draw the graph. That shows the main features. We should see (roughly) where\nx\nlies. There may be several minima, or possibly none. But what we see depends on\na decision that is ours to make--the range of x and y in the viewing window.\nIf nothing is known about y.x/, the range is hard to choose. We can accept a default\nrange, and zoom in or out. We can use the autoscaling program in Section 1.7.\nSomehow x\ncan be observed on the screen. Then the problem is to compute it.\nI would like to work with a specific example. We solved it by calculus--to find\nthe best point x\nto enter an expressway. The speeds in Section 3.2 were 30 and 60:\nThe length of the fast road will be b D 6: The range of reasonable values for the\nentering point is 0\n¤ x\n¤ 6: The distance to the road in Figure 3.12 is a D 3: We\ndrive a distance\n?\n32 Cx2 at speed 30 and the remaining distance 6\nx at speed 60:\ndriving time\ny.x/ D 1\na\n32 Cx2 C 1\n60.6\nx/:\n(2)\nThis is the function to be minimized. Its graph is extremely flat.\nIt may seem unusual for the graph to be so level. On the contrary, it is common.\nA flat graph is the whole point of dy=dx D 0:\n\n3.4\nGraphs\nThe graph near the minimum looks like y D Cx2: It is a parabola sitting on a\nhorizontal tangent. At a distance of x D :01, we only go up by C.x/2 D :0001C:\nUnless C is a large number, this y can hardly be seen.\nFig. 3.12\nEnter at x: The graph of driving time y.x/: Zoom boxes locate x\n.\nThe solution is to change scale. Zoom in on x\n: The tangent line stays flat, since\ndy=dx is still zero. But the bending from C is increased. Figure 3.12 shows the zoom\nbox blown up into a new graph of y.x/:\nA calculator has one or more ways to find x\n: With a TRACE mode, you direct\na cursor along the graph. From the display of y values, read ymax and x\nto the\nnearest pixel. A zoom gives better accuracy, because it stretches the axes--each\npixel represents a smaller x and y: The TI-81 stretches by 4 as default. Even\nbetter, let the whole process be graphical--draw the actual ZOOM BOX on the\nscreen. Pick two opposite corners, press ENTER, and the box becomes the new\nviewing window (Figure 3.12).\nThe first zoom narrows the search for x\n: It lies between x D 1 and x D 3: We build\na new ZOOM BOX and zoom in again. Now 1:5\n¤ x\n\n¤ 2: Reasonable accuracy\ncomes quickly. High accuracy does not come quickly. It takes time to create the box\nand execute the zoom.\nQuestion 1\nWhat happens as we zoom in, if all boxes are square (equal scaling) ?\nAnswer\nThe picture gets flatter and flatter. We are zooming in to the tangent line.\nChanging x to X=4 and y to Y=4, the parabola y D x2 flattens to Y D X 2=4: To see\nany bending, we must use a long thin zoom box.\nI want to change to a totally different approach. Suppose we have a formula for\ndy=dx: That derivative was produced by an infinite zoom! The limit of y=x\ncame by brainpower alone:\ndy\ndx D\nx\n?\n32 Cx2 D\n60:\nCall this f .x/:\nThis function is zero at x\n: The computing problem is completely changed: Solve\nf .x/ D 0: It is easier to find a root of f .x/ than a minimum of y.x/. The graph of\nf .x/ crosses the x axis. The graph of y.x/ goes flat--this is harder to pinpoint.\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nFig. 3.13\nTake the model function y D x2 for\n|x\n|\n:01: The slope f D 2x changes\nfrom\n:02 to C:02: The value of x2 moves only by :0001 --its minimum point is\nhard to see.\nTo repeat: Minimization is easier with dy=dx: The screen shows an order of\nmagnitude improvement, when we trace or zoom on f .x/ D 0: In calculus, we have\nbeen taking the derivative for granted. It is natural to get blase about dy=dx D 0: We\nforget how intelligent it is, to work with the slope instead of the function.\nQuestion 2\nHow do you get another order of magnitude improvement?\nAnswer\nUse the next derivative! With a formula for df=dx, which is d 2y=dx2,\nthe convergence is even faster. In two steps the error goes from :01 to :0001 to\n:00000001: Another infinite zoom went into the formula for df=dx, and Newton's\nmethod takes account of it. Sections 3.6 and 3.7 study f .x/ D 0:\nThe expressway example allows perfect accuracy. We can solve dy=dx D 0 by\nalgebra. The equation simplifies to 60x D 30\n?\n32 Cx2: Dividing by 30 and squaring\nyields 4x2 D 32Cx2: Then 3x2 D 32: The exact solution is x\nD\n?\n3 D 1:73205:::\nA model like this is a benchmark, to test competing methods. It also displays what\nwe never appreciated--the extreme flatness of the graph. The difference in driving\ntime between entering at x\nD\n?\n3 and x D 2 is one second.\nTHE CENTERING TRANSFORM AND ZOOM TRANSFORM\nFor a photograph we do two things--point the right way and stand at the right\ndistance. Then take the picture. Those steps are the same for a graph. First we pick\nthe new center point. The graph is shifted, to move that point from .a;b/ to .0;0/:\nThen we decide how far the graph should reach. It fits in a rectangle, just like the\nphotograph. Rescaling to x=c and y=d puts the desired section of the curve into the\nrectangle.\nA good photographer does more (like an artist). The subjects are placed and\nthe camera is focused. For good graphs those are necessary too. But an everyday\ncalculator or computer or camera is built to operate without an artist--just aim\nand shoot. I want to explain how to aim at y D f .x/:\nWe are doing exactly what a calculator does, with one big difference. It doesn't\nchange coordinates. We do. When x D 1, y D\n2 moves to the center of the viewing\nwindow, the calculator still shows that point as .1;\n2/: When the centering\ntransform acts on y C2 D m.x\n1/, those numbers disappear. This will be\nconfusing unless x and y also change. The new coordinates are X D x\n1 and\nY D y C2. Then the new equation is Y D mX.\nThe main point (for humans) is to make the algebra simpler. The computer has no\npreference for Y D mX over y\ny0 D m.x\nx0/: It accepts 2x2\n4x as easily as\nx2: But we do prefer Y D mX and y D x2, partly because their graphs go through\n.0;0/: Ever since zero was invented, mathematicians have liked that number best.\n3F A centering transform shifts left by a and down by b:\nX D x\na and Y D y\nb change y D f .x/ into Y Cb D f .X Ca/:\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe parabola y D 2x2\n4x has its minimum when dy=dx D\n4x\n4 D 0: Thus x D 1 and y D\n2: Move this bottom point to the center:\n\n3.4\nGraphs\ny D 2x2\n4x is\nY C2 D 2.X\n1/2\n4.X\n1/\nor\nY D 2X 2:\nThe new parabola Y D 2X 2 has its bottom at .0;0/: It is the same curve, shifted\nacross and up. The only simpler parabola is y D x2: This final step is the job of the\nzoom.\nNext comes scaling. We may want more detail (zoom in to see the tangent line).\nWe may want a big picture (zoom out to check asymptotes). We might stretch one\naxis more than the other, if the picture looks like a pancake or a skyscraper.\n3G A zoom transform scales the X and Y axes by c and d:\nx D cX\nand\ny D dY\nchange\nY D F.X/\nto\ny D dF.x=c/:\nThe new x and y are boldface letters, and the graph is rescaled. Often c D d:\nEXAMPLE 5\nStart with Y D 2X 2: Apply a square zoom with c D d: In the\nnew xy coordinates, the equation is y=c D 2.x=c/2: The number 2 disappears if\nc D d D 2: With the right centering and the right zoom, every parabola that opens\nupward is y D x2:\nQuestion 3\nWhat happens to the derivatives (slope and bending) after a zoom?\nAnswer\nThe slope (first derivative) is multiplied by d=c: Apply the chain rule to\ny D dF.x=c/: A square zoom has d=c D 1--lines keep their slope. The second\nderivative is multiplied by d=c2, which changes the bending. A zoom out divides\nby small numbers c D d, so the big picture is more, curved.\nCombining the centering and zoom transforms, as we do in practice, gives y in\nterms of x:\ny D f .x/\nbecomes\nY D f .X Ca/\nb\nand then\ny D d\n\nf\nx\nc Ca\n\nb\n\n:\nFig. 3.14\nChange of coordinates by centering and zoom. Calculators still show .x;y/:\nQuestion 4\nFind x and y ranges after two transforms. Start between\n1 and 1:\nAnswer\nThe window after centering is\n¤ x\na\n¤ 1 and\n¤ y\nb\n¤ 1: The\nwindow after zoom is\n¤ c.x\na/\n¤ 1 and\n¤ d.y\nb/\n¤ 1: The point .1;1/\nwas originally in the corner. The point .c\n1 Ca;d\n1 Cb/ is now in the corner.\nThe numbers a;b;c;d are chosen to produce a simpler function (like y D x2).\nOr else--this is important in applied mathematics--they are chosen to make x and y\n\"dimensionless.\" An example is y D 1\n2 cos 8t: The frequency 8 has dimension\n1=time. The amplitude 1\n2 is a distance. With d D 2 cm and c D 8 sec, the units are\nremoved and y D cos t:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nMay I mention one transform that does change the slope ? It is a rotation.\nThe whole plane is turned. A photographer might use it--but normally people are\nsupposed to be upright. You use rotation when you turn a map or straighten a picture.\nIn the next section, an unrecognizable hyperbola is turned into Y D 1=X:\n3.4\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe position, slope, and bending of y D f .x/ are decided by\na\n,\nb\nand\nc\n.

It is not easy to rank the top four:\n1. straight lines\n2. sines and cosines (oscillation)\n3. exponentials (growth and decay)\n4. parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas (using 1;x;y;x2;xy;y2).\nThe curves that I wrote last, the Greeks would have written first. It is so natural to\ngo from linear equations to quadratic equations. Straight lines use 1;x;y: Second\ndegree curves include x2;xy;y2: If we go on to x3 and y3, the mathematics gets\ncomplicated. We now study equations of second degree, and the curves they produce.\nIt is quite important to see both the equations and the curves. This section connects\ntwo great parts of mathematics--analysis of the equation and geometry of the curve.\nTogether they produce \"analytic geometry.\" You already know about functions and\ngraphs. Even more basic: Numbers correspond to points. We speak about \"the point\n.5;2/:\" Euclid might not have understood.\nWhere Euclid drew a 45\nline through the origin, Descartes wrote down y D x:\nAnalyticgeometry has becomecentral to mathematics--wenow look at one partof it.\nFig. 3.15\nThe cutting plane gets steeper: circle to ellipse to parabola to hyperbola.\nCONIC SECTIONS\nThe parabola and ellipse and hyperbola have absolutely remarkable properties. The\nGreeks discovered that all these curves come from slicing a cone by a plane. The\ncurves are \"conic sections.\" A level cut gives a circle, and a moderate angle produces\nan ellipse. A steep cut gives the two pieces of a hyperbola (Figure 3.15d). At the\nborderline, when the slicing angle matches the cone angle, the plane carves out a\nparabola. It has one branch like an ellipse, but it opens to infinity like a hyperbola.\nThroughout mathematics, parabolas are on the border between ellipses and\nhyperbolas.\nTo repeat: We can slice through cones or we can look for equations. For a cone\nof light, we see an ellipse on the wall. (The wall cuts into the light cone.) For an\nequation Ax2 CBxy CCy2 CDx CEy CF D 0, we will work to make it simpler.\n\n3.5\nParabolas, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas\nThe graph will be centered and rescaled (and rotated if necessary), aiming for an\nequation like y D x2: Eccentricity and polar coordinates are left for Chapter 9.\nTHE PARABOLA y D ax2 Cbx Cc\nYou knew this function long before calculus. The graph crosses the x axis when\ny D 0: The quadratic formula solves y D 3x2\n4x C1 D 0, and so does factoring\ninto .x\n1/.3x\n1/: The crossing points x D 1 and x D 1\n3 come from algebra.\nThe other important point is found by calculus. It is the minimum point, where\ndy=dx D 6x\n4 D 0:The x coordinate is 4\n6 D 2\n3, halfway between the crossing points.\nThe height is ymin D\n3: This is the vertex V in Figure 3.16a--at the bottom of the\nparabola.\nA parabola has no asymptotes. The slope 6x\n4 doesn't approach a constant.\nTo center the vertex Shift left by\n3 and up by\n3: So introduce the new\nvariables X D x\n3 and Y D y C 1\n3: Then x D 2\n3 and y D\n3 correspond to\nX D Y D 0--which is the new vertex:\ny D 3x2\n4x C1\nbecomes\nY D 3X 2:\n(1)\nCheck the algebra.

With a D 3 we find y D x2--the graph is\nmagnified by 3: In two steps we have reached the model parabola opening upward.\nFig. 3.16\nParabola with minimum at V: Rays reflect to focus. Centered in (b), rescaled in (c).\nA parabola has another important point--the focus. Its distance from the vertex is\ncalled p: The special parabola y D x2 has p D 1=4, and other parabolas Y D aX 2\nhave p D 1=4a: You magnify by a factor a to get y D x2: The beautiful property of a\nparabola is that every ray coming straight down is reflected to the focus.\nProblem 2:3:25 located the focus F --here we mention two applications. A solar\ncollector and a TV dish are parabolic. They concentrate sun rays and TV signals\nonto a point--a heat cell or a receiver collects them at the focus. The 1982 UMAP\nJournal explains how radar and sonar use the same idea. Car headlights turn the idea\naround, and send the light outward.\nHere is a classical fact about parabolas. From each point on the curve, the\ndistance to the focus equals the distance to the \"directrix.\" The directrix is the\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nline y D\np below the vertex (so the vertex is halfway between focus and directrix).\nWith p D 1\n4, the distance down from any .x;y/ is y C 1\n4: Match that with the distance\nto the focus at\n0; 1\n\n-- this is the square root below. Out comes the special parabola\ny D x2:\ny C 1\n4 D\nb\nx2 C\ny\n\nN\n(square both sides)\n\nN\ny D x2:\n(2)\nThe exercises give practice with all the steps we have taken--center the parabola to\nY D aX 2, rescale it to y D x2, locate the vertex and focus and directrix.\nSummary for other parabolas\ny D ax2 Cbx Cc has its vertex where dy=dx is\nzero. Thus 2ax Cb D 0 and x D\nb=2a: Shifting across to that point is \"completing\nthe square\":\nax2 Cbx Cc\nequals\na\n\nx C b\n2a\nCC:\n(3)\nHere C D c\n.b2=4a/ is the height of the vertex. The centering transform\nX D x C.b=2a/,Y D y\nC producesY D aX 2: It moves the vertex to .0;0/, where\nit belongs.\nFor the ellipse and hyperbola, our plan of attack is the same:\n1. Center the curve to remove any linear terms Dx and Ey:\n2. Locate each focus and discover the reflection property.\n3. Rotate to remove Bxy if the equation contains it.\nELLIPSES x2\na2 C y2\nb2 D 1\n(CIRCLES HAVE a D b)\nThis equation makes the ellipse symmetric about .0;0/--the center. Changing x to\nx or y to\ny leaves the same equation. No extra centering or rotation is needed.\nThe equation also shows that x2=a2 and y2=b2 cannot exceed one. (They add\nto one and can't be negative.) Therefore x2\n¤ a2, and x stays between\na and a:\nSimilarly y stays between b and\nb: The ellipse is inside a rectangle.\nBy solving for y we get a function (or two functions!) of x:\ny2\nb2 D 1\nx2\na2\ngives\ny\nb D\n\nx2\na2\nor\ny D\nb\na\na\na2\nx2:\nThe graphs are the top half .C/ and bottom half . / of the ellipse. To draw the ellipse,\nplot them together. They meet when y D 0, at x D a on the far right of Figure 3.17\nand at x D\na on the far left. The maximum y D b and minimum y D\nb are at the\ntop and bottom of the ellipse, where we bump into the enclosing rectangle.\nA circle is a special case of an ellipse, when a D b. The circle equation x2 C\ny2 D r2 is the ellipse equation with a D b D r:This circle is centered at .0;0/; other\ncircles are centered at x D h;y D k: The circle is determined by its radius r and its\ncenter .h;k/:\nEquation of circle W\n.x\nh/2C.y\nk/2 D r2:\n(4)\nIn words, the distance from .x;y/ on the circle to .h;k/ at the center is r: The\nequation has linear terms\n2hx and\n2ky--they disappear when the center is .0;0/:\n\n3.5\nParabolas, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas\nEXAMPLE 1\nFind the circle that has a diameter from .1;7/ to .5;7/:\nSolution\nThe center is halfway at .3;7/: So r D 2 and .x\n3/2C.y\n7/2 D 22:\nEXAMPLE 2\nFind the center and radius of the circle x2\n6x Cy2\n14y D\n54:\nSolution\nComplete x2\n6x to the square .x\n3/2 by adding 9: Complete\ny2\n14y to .y\n7/2 by adding 49: Adding 9 and 49 to both sides of the equation\nleaves .x\n3/2C.y\n7/2 D 4--the same circle as in Example 1.\nQuicker Solution Match the given equation with .4/: Then h D 3, k D 7, and r D 2:\nx2\n6x Cy2\n14y D\nmust agree with\nx2\n2hx Ch2 Cy2\n2ky Ck2 D r2:\nThe change to X D x\nh and Y D y\nk moves the center of the circle from .h;k/\nto .0;0/: This is equally true for an ellipse:\nThe ellipse .x\nh/2\na2\nC .y\nk/2\nb2\nD 1\nbecomes\nX 2\na2 C Y 2\nb2 D 1\nWhen we rescale by x D X=a and y D Y=b, we get the unit circle x2 Cy2 D 1:\nThe unit circle has area : The ellipse has area ab (proved later in the book).\nThe distance around the circle is 2: The distance around an ellipse does not rescale--\nit has no simple formula.\nFig. 3.17\nUncentered circle. Centered ellipse x2=32 Cy2=22 D 1: The distance from center\nto far right is also a D 3: All rays from F2 reflect to F1:\nNow we leave circles and concentrate on ellipses. They have two foci (pronounced\nfo-sigh). For a parabola, the second focus is at infinity. For a circle, both foci are at\nthe center. The foci of an ellipse are on its longer axis (its major axis), one focus on\neach side of the center:\nF1 is at x D c D\na\na2\nb2\nand\nF2 is at x D\nc:\nThe right triangle in Figure 3.17 has sides a;b;c: From the top of the ellipse, the\ndistance to each focus is a: From the endpoint at x D a, the distances to the foci are\naCc and a\nc: Adding .aCc/C.a\nc/ gives 2a: As you go around the ellipse,\nthe distance to F1 plus the distance to F2 is constant (always 2a).\n3H At all points on the ellipse, the sum of distances from the foci is 2a: This\nis another equation for the ellipse:\nfrom F1 and F2 to .x;y/ W\na\n.x\nc/2 C y2 C\na\n.x Cc/2Cy2 D 2a:\n(5)\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nTo draw an ellipse, tie a string of length 2a to the foci. Keep the string taut and your\nmoving pencil will create the ellipse. This description uses a and c--the other form\nuses a and b (remember b2 Cc2 D a2). Problem 24 asks you to simplify equation (5)\nuntil you reach x2=a2 Cy2=b2 D 1:\nThe \"whispering gallery\" of the United States Senate is an ellipse. If you stand at\none focus and speak quietly, you can be heard at the other focus (and nowhere else).\nYour voice is reflected off the walls to the other focus--following the path of the\nstring. For a parabola the rays come in to the focus from infinity--where the second\nfocus is.\nA hospital uses this reflection property to split up kidney stones. The patient sits\ninside an ellipse with the kidney stone at one focus. At the other focus a lithotripter\nsends out hundreds of small shocks. You get a spinal anesthetic (I mean the patient)\nand the stones break into tiny pieces.\nThe most important focus is the Sun. The ellipse is the orbit of the Earth. See\nSection 12.4 for a terrible printing mistake by the Royal Mint, on England's\nlast pound note. They put the Sun at the center.\nQuestion 1\nWhy do the whispers (and shock waves) arrive together at the second\nfocus?\nAnswer\nWhichever way they go, the distance is 2a: Exception: straight path is 2c:\nQuestion 2\nLocate the ellipse with equation 4x2 C9y2 D 36:\nAnswer\nDivide by 36 to change the constant to 1: Now identify a and b:\nx2\n9 C y2\n4 D 1 so a D\n?\n9 and b D\n?\n4: Foci at\n\n?\n4 D\n\n?\n5:\nQuestion 3\nShift the center of that ellipse across and down to x D 1, y D\n5:\nAnswer\nChange x to x\n1: Change y to y C5: The equation becomes\n.x\n1/2=9C.y C5/2=4 D 1: In practice we start with this uncentered ellipse and\ngo the other way to center it.\nHYPERBOLAS y2\na2\nx2\nb2 D 1\nNotice the minus sign for a hyperbola. That makes all the difference. Unlike an\nellipse, x and y can both be large. The curve goes out to infinity. It is still symmetric,\nsince x can change to\nx and y to\ny:\nThe center is at .0;0/: Solving for y again yields two functions (C and\n):\ny2\na2\nx2\nb2 D 1\ngives\ny\na D\n\n1C x2\nb2\nor\ny D\na\nb\na\nb2 Cx2:\n(6)\nThe hyperbola has two branches that never meet. The upper branch, with a plus sign,\nhas y\n¥a: The vertex V1 is at x D 0;y D a--the lowest point on the branch. Much\nfurther out, when x is large, the hyperbola climbs up beside its sloping asymptotes:\nif x2\nb2 D 1000 then y2\na2 D 1001: So y\na is close to x\nb or\nx\nb :\n\n3.5\nParabolas, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas\nFig. 3.18\nThe hyperbola 1\n4y2\n9x2 D 1 has a D 2;b D 3;c D\n?\n4C9: The distances to F1\nand F2 differ by 2a D 4:\nThe asymptotes are the lines y=a D x=b and y=a D\nx=b: Their slopes are a=b and\na=b: You can't miss them in Figure 3.18.\nFor a hyperbola, the foci are inside the two branches. Their distance from the\ncenter is still called c: But now c D\n?\na2 Cb2, which is larger than a and b: The\nvertex is a distance c\na from one focus and c Ca from the other. The difference\n(not the sum) is .c Ca/\n.c\na/ D 2a:\nAll points on the hyperbola have this property: The difference between distances\nto the foci is constantly 2a: A ray coming in to one focus is reflected toward the\nother. The reflection is on the outside of the hyperbola, and the inside of the ellipse.\nHere is an application to navigation. Radio signals leave two fixed transmitters at\nthe same time. A ship receives the signals a millisecond apart. Where is the ship ?\nAnswer: It is on a hyperbola with foci at the transmitters. Radio signals travel\n186 miles in a millisecond, so 186 D 2a: This determines the curve. In Long Range\nNavigation (LORAN) a third transmitter gives another hyperbola. Then the ship is\nlocated exactly.\nQuestion 4\nHow do hyperbolas differ from parabolas, far from the center?\nAnswer\nHyperbolas have asymptotes. Parabolas don't.\nThe hyperbola has a natural rescaling. The appearance of x=b is a signal to change\nto X: Similarly y=a becomes Y: Then Y D 1 at the vertex, and we have a standard\nhyperbola:\ny2=a2\nx2=b2 D 1\nbecomes\nY 2\nX 2 D 1:\nA 90\nturn gives X 2\nY 2 D 1--the hyperbola opens to the sides. A 45\nturn\nproduces 2XY D 1: We show below how to recognize x2 Cxy Cy2 D 1 as an\nellipse and x2 C3xy Cy2 D 1 as a hyperbola. (They are not circles because of the\nxy term.) When the xy coefficient increases past 2, x2 Cy2 no longer indicates an\nellipse.\nQuestion 5\nLocate the hyperbola with equation 9y2\n4x2 D 36:\nAnswer\nDivide by 36: Then y2=4\nx2=9 D 1: Recognize a D\n?\n4 and b D\n?\n9:\nQuestion 6\nLocate the uncentered hyperbola 9y2\n18y\n4x2\n4x D 28:\nAnswer\nComplete 9y2\n18y to 9.y\n1/2 by adding 9: Complete 4x2 C4x to\n4.x C 1\n2/2 by adding 4\n2 D 1: The equation is rewritten as 9.y\n1/2\n4.x C 1\n2/2 D\n28C9\n1: This is the hyperbola in Question 5--except its center is . 1\n2;1/:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nTo summarize: Find the center by completing squares. Then read off a and b:\nTHE GENERAL EQUATION Ax2 CBxy CCy2 CDx CEy CF D 0\nThis equation is of second degree, containing any and all of 1;x;y;x2;xy;y2:\nA plane is cutting through a cone. Is the curve a parabola or ellipse or\nhyperbola ? Start with the most important case Ax2 CBxy CCy2 D 1:\n3I The equation Ax2 CBxy Ccy2 D 1 produces a hyperbola if B2\n¡ 4AC and\nan ellipse if B2\n4AC: A parabola has B2 D 4AC:\nTo recognize the curve, we remove Bxy by rotating the plane. This also changes A\nand C --but the combination B2\n4AC is not changed (proof omitted). An\nexample is 2xy D 1, with B2 D 4: It rotates to y2\nx2 D 1, with\n4AC D 4: That\npositive number 4 signals a hyperbola--sinceA D\n1 and C D 1 have opposite signs.\nAnother example is x2 Cy2 D 1: It is a circle (a special ellipse). However we\nrotate, the equation stays the same. The combination B2\n4AC D 0\n1 is\nnegative, as predicted for ellipses.\nTo rotate by an angle , change x and y to new variables x\n1 and y\n1:\nx Dx\n1 cos\ny\n1 sin\ny Dx\n1 sin Cy\n1 cos\nand\nx\n1 D\nx cos Cy sin\ny\n1 D\ny sin Cx cos :\n(7)\nSubstitutingfor x and y changesAx2 CBxy CCy2 D 1 to A\n1x\n12 CB\n1x\n1y\n1CC\n1y\n12 D\n1: The formulas for A\n1, B\n1, C\n1 are painful so I go to the key point:\nB\n1 is zero if the rotation angle has tan 2 D B=.A\nC/:\nWith B\n1 D 0, the curve is easily recognized from A\n1x\n12 CC\n1y\n12 D 1: It is a hyperbola\nif A\n1 andC\n1 haveopposite signs. ThenB\n4A\n1C\n1 is positive.The originalB2\n4AC\nwas also positive, because this special combination stays constant during rotation.\nAfter the xy term is gone, we deal with x and y--by centering. To find the center,\ncomplete squares as in Questions 3 and 6: For total perfection, rescale to one of the\nmodel equations y D x2 or x2 Cy2 D 1 or y2\nx2 D 1:\nThe remainingquestionis aboutF D 0: Whatis the graphof Ax2 CBxy CCy2 D 0 ?\nThe ellipse-hyperbola-parabola have disappeared. But if the Greeks were right, the\ncone is still cut by a plane. The degenerate case F D 0 occurs when the plane cuts\nright through the sharp point of the cone.\nA level cut hits only that one point .0;0/: The equation shrinks to x2 Cy2 D 0,\na circle with radius zero. A steep cut gives two lines. The hyperbola becomes y2\n\nx2 D 0, leaving only its asymptotes y D\nx: A cut at the exact angle of the cone\ngives only one line, as in x2 D 0: A single point, two lines, and one line are very\nextreme cases of an ellipse, hyperbola, and parabola.\nAll these \"conic sections\" come from planes and cones. The beauty of the geometry,\nwhich Archimedes saw, is matched by the importance of the equations. Galileo\ndiscovered that projectiles go along parabolas (Chapter 12). Kepler discovered that\nthe Earth travels on an ellipse (also Chapter 12). Finally Einstein discovered that\nlight travels on hyperbolas. That is in four dimensions, and not in Chapter 12.\n\n3.5\nParabolas, Ellipses, and Hyperbolas\nequation\nvertices\nfoci\nP\ny D ax2 Cbx Cc\n\nb\n2a;c\nb2\n4a\n\n4a above vertex, also infinity\nE\nx2\na2 C y2\nb2 D 1;a\n¡ b\n.a;0/ and . a;0/\n.c;0/ and . c;0/ W c D\n?\na2\nb2\nH\ny2\na2\nx2\nb2 D 1\n.0;a/ and .0;\na/\n.0;c/ and .0;\nc/ W c D\n?\na2 Cb2\n3.5\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe graph of y D x2 C2x C5 is a\na\n.

Substituting x0 into F gives x1: This output x1 is\nthe input that leads to x2: In its turn, x2 is the input and out comes x3 D F.x2/: This\nis iteration, and it produces the sequence x0;x1;x2;::::\nThe x's may approach a limit x\n, depending on the function F: Sometimes x\n\nalso depends on the starting value x0: Sometimes there is no limit. Look at a second\nexample, which does not need a calculator.\nEXAMPLE 2\nxnC1 D F.xn/ D 1\n2xn C4: Starting from x0 D 0 the sequence is\nx1 D 1\n0C4 D 4; x2 D 1\n4C4 D 6; x3 D 1\n6C4 D 7; x4 D 1\n7C4 D 7 1\n2; ::::\nThose numbers 0;4;6;7;7 1\n2;::: seem to be approaching x\nD 8: A computer would\nconvince us. So will mathematics, when we see what is special about 8:\nWhen the x's approach x\n, the limit of xnC1 D 1\n2xn C4\nis x\nD 1\n2x\nC4: This limiting equation yields x\nD 8:\n8 is the \"steady state\" where input equals output: 8 D F.8/: It is the fixed point.\nIf we start at x0 D 8, the sequence is 8;8;8;:::: When we start at x0 D 12, the\nsequence goes back toward 8:\nx1 D 1\n12C4 D 10;\nx2 D 1\n10C4 D 9;\nx3 D 1\n9C4 D 8:5;\n::::\nEquation for limit: If the iterations xnC1 D F.xn/ converge to x\n, then x\nD F.x\n/.\nTo repeat: 8 is special because it equals 1\n8C4: The number :7391::: is special\nbecause it equals cos :7391:::: The graphs of y D x and y D F.x/ intersect at\nx\n. To explain why the x's converge (or why they don't) is the job of calculus.\nEXAMPLE 3\nxnC1 D x2\nn\nhas two fixed points: 0 D 02\nand 1 D 12: Here\nF.x/ D x2:\nStarting from x0 D 1\n2 the sequence 1\n4; 1\n16;\n256; ::: goes quickly to x\nD 0: The only\napproaches to x\nD 1 are from x0 D 1 (of course) and from x0 D\n1: Starting from\nx0 D 2 we get 4;16;256; ::: and the sequence diverges to C8:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nEach limit x\nhas a \"basin of attraction.\" The basin contains all starting points x0\nthat lead to x\n: For Examples 1 and 2, every x0 led to :7391 and 8: The basins were\nthe whole line (that is still to be proved). Example 3 had three basins--the interval\nx0\n1, the two points x0 D\n1, and all the rest. The outer basin\n|x0\n|\n¡ 1 led\nto\n8: I challenge you to find the limits and the basins of attraction (by calculator)\nfor F.x/ D x\ntan x:\nIn Example 3, x\nD 0 is attracting. Points near x\nmove toward x\n: The fixed\npoint x\nD 1 is repelling. Points near 1 move away. We now find the rule that decides\nwhether x\nis attracting or repelling. The key is the slope dF=dx at x\n.\n3J Start from any x0 near a fixed point x\nD F.x\n/:\nx\nis attracting if\n|dF=dx\n| is below 1 at x\n\nx\nis repelling if\n|dF=dx\n| is above 1 at x\n:\nFirst I will give a calculus proof. Then comes a picture of convergence,by \"cobwebs.\"\nBoth methods throw light on this crucial test for attraction:\n|dF=dx\n|\n1:\nFirst proof: Subtract x\nD F.x\n/ from xnC1 D F.xn/: The difference xnC1\nx\n\nis the same as F.xn/\nF.x\n/: This is F: The basic idea of calculus is that F\nis close to F\n1x:\nxnC1\nx\nD F.xn/\nF.x\n/\nF\n1.x\n/.xn\nx\n/:\n(1)\nThe \"error\" xn\nx\nis multiplied by the slope dF=dx: The next error xnC1\nx\nis\nsmaller or larger, based on\n|F\n|\n1 or\n|F\n|\n¡ 1 at x\n: Every step multiplies\napproximately by F\n1.x\n/: Its size controls the speed of convergence.\nIn Example 1, F.x/ is cos x and F\n1.x/ is\nsin x: There is attraction to :7391\nbecause\n|sin x\n\n|\n1: In Example 2, F is 1\n2x C4 and F\n1 is 1\n2: There is attraction to\n8: In Example 3, F is x2 and F\n1 is 2x: There is superattraction to x\nD 0 (where\nF\n1 D 0). There is repulsion from x\nD 1 (where F\n1 D 2).\nI admit one major difficulty. The approximation in equation (1) only holds near\nx\n: If x0 is far away, does the sequence still approach x\n? When there are several\nattracting points, which x\ndo we reach ? This section starts with good iterations,\nwhich solve the equation x\nD F.x\n/ or f .x/ D 0: At the end we discover Newton's\nmethod. The next section produces crazy but wonderful iterations, not convergingand\nnot blowing up. They lead to \"fractals\" and \"Cantor sets\" and \"chaos.\"\nThe mathematics of iterations is not finished. It may never be finished, but we are\nconverging on the answers. Please choose a function and join in.\nTHE GRAPH OF AN ITERATION: COBWEBS\nThe iteration xnC1 D F.xn/ involves two graphs at the same time. One is the graph\nof y D F.x/: The other is the graph of y D x (the 45\nline). The iteration jumps back\nand forth between these graphs. It is a very convenient way to see the whole process.\nExample 1 was xnC1 D cos xn: Figure 3.19 shows the graph of cos x and the\n\"cobweb.\" Starting at .x0;x0/ on the 45\nline, the rule is based on x1 D F.x0/:\nFrom .x0;x0/ go up or down to .x0;x1/ on the curve.\nFrom .x0;x1/ go across to .x1;x1/ on the 45\nline.\n\n3.6\nIterations xnC1 D F.xn/\nThese steps are repeated forever. From x1 go up to the curve at F.x1/: That height\nis x2: Now cross to the 45\nline at .x2;x2/: The iterations are aiming for .x\n;x\n/ D\n.:7391;:7391/: This is the crossing point of the two graphs y D F.x/ and y D x:\nFig. 3.19\nCobwebs go from .x0;x0/ to .x0;x1/ to .x1;x1/--line to curve to line.\nExample 2 was xnC1 D 1\n2xn C4: Both graphs are straight lines. The cobweb is\none-sided, from .0;0/ to .0;4/ to .4;4/ to .4;6/ to .6;6/: Notice how y changes\n(vertical line) and then x changes (horizontal line). The slope of F.x/ is 1\n2, so the\ndistance to 8 is multiplied by 1\n2 at every step.\nExample 3 was xnC1 D x2\nn: The graph of y D x2 crosses the 45\nline at two fixed\npoints: 02 D 0 and 12 D 1: Figure 3.20a starts the iteration close to 1, but it quickly\ngoes away. This fixed point is repelling because F\n1.1/ D 2: Distance from x\nD 1\nis doubled (at the start). One path moves down to x\nD 0--which is superattractive\nbecause F\n1 D 0: The path from x0\n¡ 1 diverges to infinity.\nEXAMPLE 4\nF.x/ has two attracting points x\n(a repelling x\nis always between).\nFigure 3.20b shows two crossings with slope zero. The iterations and cobwebs\nconverge quickly. In between, the graph of F.x/ must cross the 45\nline from below.\nThat requires a slope greater than one. Cobwebs diverge from this unstable point,\nwhich separates the basins of attraction. The fixed point x D is in a basin by itself!\nNote 1\nTo draw cobwebs on a calculator, graph y D F.x/ on top of y D x: On\na Casio, one way is to plot .x0;x0/ and give the command\nLINE:\nPLOT\nX,Y followed by\nEXE. Now move the cursor vertically to y D F.x/ and press\nEXE. Then move horizontally to y D x and press\nEXE. Continue. Each step draws\na line.\nFor the TI-81 (and also the Casio) a short program produces a cobweb. Store F.x/\nin the\nY D function slot\nY\n1. Set the range (square window or autoscaling). Run the\nprogram and answer the prompt with x0:\nPrgmC:COBWEB\n:Disp\n'\n'INITIAL\nX'\n'\n:Input\nX\n:All-off\n:Y\n-On\n:'\n'X'\n'NY\n:Lbl\n:XNS\n:Y\nNT\n:Line\n(S,S,S,T)\n:Line(S,T,T,T)\n:TNX\n:Pause\n:Goto\nNote 2\nThe x's approach x\nfrom one side when 0\ndF=dx\n1:\nNote 3\nA basin of attraction can include faraway x0's (basins can come in infinitely\nmany pieces). This makes the problem interesting. If no fixed points are attracting,\nsee Section 3.7 for \"cycles\" and \"chaos.\"\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nFig. 3.20\nConverging and diverging cobwebs: F.x/D x2 and F.x/D x\nsin x:\nTHE ITERATION xnC1 D Xn\ncf.xn/\nAt this point we offer the reader a choice. One possibility is to jump ahead to the\nnext section on \"Newton's Method.\" That method is an iteration to solve f .x/ D 0:\nThe function F.x/ combines xn and f .xn/ and f\n1.xn/ into an optimal formula\nfor xnC1: We will see how quickly Newton's method works (when it works). It is the\noutstanding algorithm to solve equations, and it is totally built on tangent\napproximations.\nThe other possibility is to understand (through calculus) a whole family of\niterations. This family depends on a number c, which is at our disposal. The best\nchoice of c produces Newton's method. I emphasize that iteration is by no means a\nnew and peculiar idea. It is a fundamental technique in scientific computing.\nWe start by recognizing that there are many ways to reach f .x\n/ D 0: (I write\nx\nfor the solution.) A good algorithm may switch to Newton as it gets close. The\niterations use f .xn/ to decide on the next point xnC1:\nxnC1 D F.xn/ D xn\ncf .xn/:\n(2)\nNotice how F.x/ is constructed from f .x/--they are different! We move f to the\nright side and multiply by a \"preconditioner\" c: The choice of c (or cn, if it changes\nfrom step to step) is absolutely critical. The starting guess x0 is also important--but\nits accuracy is not always under our control.\nSuppose the xn converge to x\n: Then the limit of equation (2) is\nx\nD x\n\ncf .x\n/:\n(3)\nThat gives f .x\n/ D 0: If the xn's have a limit, it solves the right equation. It is a\nfixed point of F (we can assume cn\nN c ¤ 0 and f .xn/\nN f .x\n/). There are two\nkey questions, and both of them are answered by the slope F\n1.x\n/:\n1. How quickly does xn approach x\n(or do the xn diverge)?\n2. What is a good choice of c (or cn) ?\nEXAMPLE 5\nf .x/ D ax\nb\nis\nzero\nat x\nD b=a: The iteration xnC1 D\nxn\nc.axn\nb/ intends to find b=a without actually dividing. (Early computers\n\n3.6\nIterations xnC1 D F.xn/\ncould not divide; they used iteration.) Subtracting x\nfrom both sides leaves an\nequation for the error:\nxnC1\nx\nD xn\nx\n\nc.axn\nb/:\nReplace b by ax\n: The right side is .1\nca/.xn\nx\n/: This \"error equation\" is\n(error)nC1 D .1\nca/(error)n:\n(4)\nAt every step the error is multiplied by .1\nca/, which is F\n1: The error goes to\nzero if\n|F\n| is less than 1. The absolute value\n|1\nca\n| decides everything:\nxn converges to x\nif and only if\nca\n1:\n(5)\nThe perfect choice (if we knew it) is c D 1=a, which turns the multiplier 1\nca into\nzero. Then one iteration gives the exact answer: x1 D x0\n.1=a/.ax0\nb/ D b=a:\nThat is the horizontal line in Figure 3.21a, converging in one step. But look at the\nother lines.\nThis example did not need calculus. Linear equations never do. The key idea is that\nclose to x\nthe nonlinear equation f .x/ D 0 is nearly linear. We apply the tangent\napproximation. You are seeing how calculus is used, in a problem that doesn't start\nby asking for a derivative.\nTHE BEST CHOICE OF c\nThe immediate goal is to study the errors xn\nx\n: They go quickly to zero, if\nthe multiplier is small. To understand xnC1 D xn\ncf .xn/, subtract the equation\nx\nD x\n\ncf .x\n/:\nxnC1\nx\nD xn\nx\n\nc.f .xn/\nf .x\n//:\n(6)\nNow calculus enters. When you see a difference of f 's think of df=dx: Replace\nf .xn/\nf .x\n/ by A.xn\nx\n/, where A stands for the slope df=dx at x\n:\nxnC1\nx\n\n.1\ncA/.xn\nx\n/:\n(7)\nThis is the error equation. The new error at step nC1 is approximately the old error\nmultiplied by m D 1\ncA: This corresponds to m D 1\nca in the linear example.\nWe keep returning to the basic test\n|m | D\n|F\n1.x\n/ |\n1:\n3K Starting near x\n; the errors xn\nx\ngo to zero if multiplier has\n|m |\n1: The\nperfect choice is c D 1=A D 1=f\n1.x\n/: Then m D 1\ncA D 0:\nThere is only one difficulty: We don't know x\n. Therefore we don't know the\nperfect c: It depends on the slope A D f\n1.x\n/ at the unknown solution. However we\ncan come close, by using the slope at xn:\nChoose cn D 1=f\n1.xn/: Then xnC1 D xn\nf .xn/=f\n1.xn/ D F.xn/.\nThis is Newton's method. The multiplier m D 1\ncA is as near to zero as we can\nmake it. By building df=dx into F.x/, Newton speeded up the convergence of the\niteration.\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nFig. 3.21\nThe error multiplier is m D 1\ncf\n1.x\n/: Newton has c D 1=f\n1.xn/ and m\nN 0:\nEXAMPLE 6\nSolve f .x/ D 2x\ncos x D 0 with different iterations (differentc's).\nThe line y D 2x crosses the cosine curve somewhere near x D 1\n2: The intersection\npoint where 2x\nD cos x\nhas no simple formula. We start from x0 D 1\n2 and iterate\nxnC1 D xn\nc.2xn\ncos xn/ with three different choices of c:\nTake c D 1 or c D 1=f\n1.x0/ or update c by Newton's rule cn D 1=f\n1.xn/:\nx0 D :50\nc D 1\nc D 1=f\n1.x0/\ncn D 1=f\n1.xn/\nx1 D\n:38\n:45063\n:45062669\nx2 D\n:55\n:45019\n:45018365\nx3 D\n:30\n:45018\n:45018361:::\nThe column with c D 1 is diverging (repelled from x\n).

Because\nm is negative the errors change sign--the cobweb goes outward.\nThe second column shows convergence with m D :018: It takes one genuine\nNewton step, then c is fixed. After n steps the error is closely proportional to\nmn D .:018/n-- that is \"linear convergence\" with a good multiplier.\nThe third column shows the \"quadratic convergence\" of Newton's method.\nMultiplying the error by m is more attractive than ever, because m\nN 0: In fact m\nitself is proportional to the error, so at each step the error is squared. Problem\n3:8:31 will show that .error/nC1\n¤ M.error/2\nn: This squaring carries us from 10\nto 10\n4 to 10\n8 to \"machine \"\" in three steps. The number of correct digits is doubled\nat every step as Newton converges.\n\n3.6\nIterations xnC1 D F.xn/\nNote 1\nThe choice c D 1 produces xnC1 D xn\nf .xn/: This is \"successive\nsubstitution.\" The equation f .x/ D 0 is rewritten as x D x\nf .x/, and each xn is\nsubstituted back to produce xnC1: Iteration with c D 1 does not always fail!\nNote 2\nNewton's method is successive substitution for f=f\n1, not f: Then m\n0:\nNote 3\nEdwards and Penney happened to choose the same example 2x D cos x:\nBut they cleverly wrote it as xnC1 D 1\n2 cos xn, which has\n|F\n| D\n| 1\n2 sin x\n|\n1: This\niteration fits into our family with c D 1\n2, and it succeeds. We asked earlier if its limit\nis 1\n2.:7391/: No, it is x\nD :450::::\nNote 4\nThe choice c D 1=f\n1.x0/ is \"modified Newton.\" After one step of Newton's\nmethod, c is fixed. The steps are quicker, because they don't require a new f\n1.xn/:\nBut we need more steps. Millions of dollars are spent on Newton's method, so speed\nis important. In all its forms, f .x/ D 0 is the central problem of computing.\n3.6\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nxnC1 D x3\nn describes, an\na\n.

The best we can do is to make the right side zero!\nThe tangent line crosses the axis at x1, while the curve crosses at x\n: The new guess\nx1 comes from f .x0/Cf\n1.x0/.x1\nx0/ D 0: Dividing by f\n1.x0/ and solving for\nx1, this is step 1 of Newton's method:\nx1 D x0\nf .x0/\nf\n1.x0/:\n(2)\nAt this new point, compute f .x1/ and f\n1.x1/--the height and slope at x1: They\ngive a new tangent line, which crosses at x2: At every step we want f .xnC1/ D 0\nand we settle for f .xn/Cf\n1.xn/.xnC1\nxn/ D 0. After dividing by f\n1.xn/, the\nformula for xnC1 is Newton's method.\n3L The tangent line from xn crosses the axis at xnC1:\nNewton's method\nxnC1 D xn\nf .xn/\nf\n1.xn/:\n(3)\nUsually this iteration xnC1 D F.xn/ converges quickly to x\n:\nFig. 3.22\nNewton's method along tangent lines from x0 to x1 to x2:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nLinear approximation involves three numbers. They are x (across) and f (up)\nand the slope f\n1.x/: If we know two of those numbers, we can estimate the third. It\nis remarkable to realize that calculus has now used all three calculations--they are\nthe key to this subject:\n1. Estimate the slope f\n1.x/ from f=x\n(Section 2.1)\n2. Estimate the change f from f\n1.x/x\n(Section 3.1)\n3. Estimate the change x from f=f\n1.x/\n(Newton's method)\nThe desired f is\nf .xn/: Formula .3/ is exactly x D\nf .xn/=f\n1.xn/:\nEXAMPLE 1\n(Square roots)\nf .x/ D x2\nb is zero at x\nD\n?\nb and also at\n\n?\nb:\nNewton's method is a quick way to find square roots--probably built into your\ncalculator. The slope is f\n1.xn/ D 2xn, and formula .3/ for the new guess becomes\nxnC1 D xn\nx2\nn\nb\n2xn\nD xn\n2xn C b\n2xn\n:\n(4)\nThis simplifies to xnC1 D 1\n2.xn Cb=xn/: Guess the square root, divide into b; and\naverage the two numbers. The ancient Babylonians had this same idea, without\nknowing functions or slopes. They iterated xnC1 D F.xn/:\nF.x/ D 1\n\nx C b\nx\n\nand\nF\n1.x/ D 1\n\nb\nx2\n\n:\n(5)\nThe Babylonians did exactly the right thing. The slope F\n1 is zero at the solution,\nwhen x2 D b: That makes Newton's method converge at high speed. The convergence\ntest is\n|F\n1.x\n/ |\n1: Newton achieves F\n1.x\n/ D 0--which is superconvergence.\nTo\nfind\n?\n4,\nstart\nthe\niteration xnC1 D 1\n2.xn C4=xn/\nat x0 D 1: Then\nx1 D 1\n2.1C4/:\nx1 D 2:5\nx2 D 2:05\nx3 D 2:0006\nx4 D 2:000000009:\nThe wrong decimal is twice as far out at each step. The error is squared.\nSubtracting x\nD 2 from both sides of xnC1 D F.xn/ gives an error equation which\ndisplays that square:\nxnC1\n2 D 1\n\nxn C 4\nxn\n\n2 D 1\n2xn\n.xn\n2/2:\n(6)\nThis is .error/nC1\n4.error/2\nn: It explains the speed of Newton's method.\nRemark 1\nYou can't start this iteration at x0 D 0: The first step computes 4=0\nand blows up. Figure 3.22a shows why--the tangent line at zero is horizontal. It will\nnever cross the axis.\nRemark 2\nStarting at x0 D\n1, Newton converges to\n\n?\n2 instead of C\n?\n2: That\nis the other x\n: Often it is difficult to predict which x\nNewton's method will choose.\nAround every solution is a \"basin of attraction,\" but other parts of the basin may be\nfar away. Numerical experiments are needed, with many starts x0: Finding basins of\nattraction was one of the problems that led to fractals.\n\n3.7\nNewton's Method (and Chaos)\nEXAMPLE 2\nSolve 1\nx\na D 0 to find x\nD 1\na without dividing by a.\nHere f .x/ D .1=x/\na: Newton uses f\n1.x/ D\n1=x2: Surprisingly, we don't\ndivide:\nxnC1 D xn\n.1=xn/\na\n1=x2\nn\nD xn Cxn\nax2\nn:\n(7)\nDo these iterations converge? I will take a D 2 and aim for x\nD 1\n2: Subtracting 1\nfrom both sides of .7/ changes the iteration into the error equation:\nxnC1 D 2xn\n2x2\nn\nbecomes\nxnC1\n2 D\nxn\n2 :\n(8)\nAt each step the error is squared. This is terrific if (and only if) you are close to\nx\nD 1\n2: Otherwise squaring a large error and multiplying by\n2 is not good:\nx0 D :70\nx1 D :42\nx2 D :487\nx3 D :4997\nx4 D :4999998\nx0 D 1:21\nx1 D\n:5\nx2 D\n1:5\nx3 D\n7:5\nx4 D\n127:5\nThe algebra in Problem 18 confirms those experiments. There is fast convergence if\nx0\n1: There is divergence if x0 is negative or x0\n¡ 1: The tangent line goes to\na negative x1: After that Figure 3.22 shows a long trip backwards.\nIn the previous section we drew F.x/: The iteration xnC1 D F.xn/ converged to\nthe 45\nline, where x\nD F.x\n/: In this section we are drawing f .x/: Now x\nis\nthe point on the axis where f .x\n/ D 0:\nTo repeat: It is f .x\n/ D 0 that we aim for. But it is the slope F\n1.x\n/ that\ndecides whether we get there. Example 2 has F.x/ D 2x\n2x2: The fixed points are\nx\nD 1\n2 (our solution) and x\nD 0 (not attractive). The slopes F\n1.x\n/ are zero (typical\nNewton) and 2 (typical repeller). The key to Newton's method is F\n1 D 0 at the\nsolution:\nThe slope of F.x/ D x\nf .x/\nf\n1.x/ is f .x/f\n2.x/\n.f\n1.x//2 : Then F\n1.x/ D 0 when f .x/ D 0:\nThe examples x2 D b and 1=x D a show fast convergence or failure. In Chapter 13,\nand in reality, Newton's method solves much harder equations. Here I am going to\nchoose a third example that came from pure curiosity about what might happen. The\nresults are absolutely amazing. The equation is x2 D\n1:\nEXAMPLE 3\nWhat happens to Newton's method if you ask it to solve\nf .x/ D x2C1 D 0 ?\nThe only solutions are the imaginary numbers x\nD i and x\nD\ni: There is no real\nsquare root of\n1: Newton's method might as well give up. But it has no way to\nknow that! The tangent line still crosses the axis at a new point xnC1, even if the\ncurve y D x2 C1 never crosses. Equation (5) still gives the iteration for b D\n1:\nxnC1 D 1\n\nxn\nxn\n\nD F.xn/:\n(9)\nThe x's cannot approach i or\ni (nothing is imaginary). So what do they do ?\nThe starting guess x0 D 1 is interesting. It is followed by x1 D 0: Then x2 divides\nby zero and blows up. I expected other sequences to go to infinity. But the experiments\nshowed something different (and mystifying). When xn is large, xnC1 is less than half\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nas large. After xn D 10 comes xnC1 D 1\n2.10\n10/ D 4:95: After much indecision\nand a long wait, a number near zero eventually appears. Then the next guess divides\nby that small number and goes far out again. This reminded me of \"chaos.\"\nIt is tempting to retreat to ordinary examples, where Newton's method is a big\nsuccess. By trying exercises from the book or equations of your own, you will see that\nthe fast convergence to\n?\n4 is very typical. The function can be much more\ncomplicated than x2\n4 (in practice it certainly is). The iteration for 2x D cosx was\nin the previous section, and the error was squared at every step. If Newton's method\nstarts close to x\n, its convergence is overwhelming. That has to be the main point of\nthis section: Follow the tangent line.\nInstead of those good functions, may I stay with this strange example x2 C1 D 0 ?\nIt is not so predictable, and maybe not so important, but somehow it is more\ninteresting. There is no real solution x\n, and Newton's method xnC1 D 1\n2.xn\n1=xn/\nbounces around. We will now discover xn:\nA FORMULA FOR xn\nThe key is an exercise from trigonometry books. Most of those problems just give\npractice with sines and cosines, but this one exactly fits 1\n2.xn\n1=xn/:\ncos\nsin\nsin\ncos\n\nD cos 2\nsin 2\nor\n\ncot\n\ncot\n\nD cot 2\nIn the left equation, the common denominator is 2 sin cos (which is sin 2). The\nnumerator is cos2\nsin2 (which is cos 2). Replace cosine=sine by cotangent,\nand the identity says this:\nIf\nx0 D cot\nthen\nx1 D cot 2:\nThen\nx2 D cot 4\nThen\nxn D cot 2n:\nThis is the formula. Our points are on the cotangent curve. Figure 3.23 starts from\nx0 D 2 D cot, and every iteration doubles the angle.\nExample A The sequence x0 D 1;x1 D 0;x2 D\n8 matches the cotangents of =4;=2,\nand : This sequence blows up because x2 has a division by x1 D 0:\nFig. 3.23\nNewton's method for x2 C1 D 0: Iteration gives xn D cot2n:\nExample B The sequence 1=\n?\n3;\n1=\n?\n3;1=\n?\n3 matches the cotangents of =3;2=3,\nand 4=3: This sequence cycles forever because x0 D x2 D x4 D ::::\n\n3.7\nNewton's Method (and Chaos)\nExample C Start with a large x0 (a small ). Then x1 is about half as large (at 2).\nEventually one of the angles 4;8; ::: hits on a large cotangent, and the x's go far\nout again. This is typical. Examples A and B were special, when = was 1\n4 or 1\n3:\nWhat we have here is chaos. The x's can't converge. They are strongly repelled\nby all points. They are also extremely sensitive to the value of : After ten steps is\nmultiplied by 210 D 1024: The starting angles 60\nand 61\nlook close, but now they\nare different by 1024\n. If that were a multiple of 180\n, the cotangents would still be\nclose. In fact the x10's are 0:6 and 14:\nThis chaos in mathematics is also seen in nature. The most familiar example is the\nweather, which is much more delicate than you might think. The headline \"Forecast-\ning Pushed Too Far\" appeared in Science .1989/. The article said that the snowballing\nof small errors destroys the forecast after six days. We can't follow the weather equa-\ntions for a month--the flight of a plane can change everything. This is a revolutionary\nidea, that a simple rule can lead to answers that are too sensitive to compute.\nWe are accustomed to complicated formulas (or no formulas). We are not\naccustomed to innocent-looking formulas like cot 2n, which are absolutely hopeless\nafter 100 steps.\nCHAOS FROM A PARABOLA\nNow I get to tell you about new mathematics. First I will change the iteration xnC1 D\n2.xn\n1=xn/ into one that is even simpler. By switching from x to z D 1=.1Cx2/,\neach new z turns out to involve only the old z and z2:\nznC1 D 4zn\n4z2\nn:\n(10)\nThis is the most famous quadratic iteration in the world. There are books about\nit, and Problem 28 shows where it comes from. Our formula for xn leads to zn:\nzn D\n1Cx2\nn\nD\n1C.cot 2n/2 D .sin 2n/2:\n(11)\nThe sine is just as unpredictable as the cotangent, when 2n gets large. The new thing\nis to locate this quadratic as the last member (when a D 4) of the family\nznC1 D azn\naz2\nn;\n¤ a\n¤ 4:\n(12)\nExample 2 happened to be the middle member a D 2, converging to 1\n2: I would like\nto give a brief and very optional report on this iteration, for different a's.\nThe general principle is to start with a number z0 between 0 and 1, and compute\nz1;z2;z3; :::: It is fascinating to watch the behavior change as a increases. You can\nsee it on your own computer. Here we describe some things to look for. All numbers\nstay between 0 and 1 and they may approach a limit. That happens when a is small:\nfor 0\n¤ a\n¤ 1 the zn approach z\nD 0\nfor 1\n¤ a\n¤ 3 the zn approach z\nD .a\n1/=a\nThose limit points are the solutions of z D F.z/: They are the fixed points where\nz\nD az\n\na.z\n/2: But remember the test for approaching a limit: The slope at z\n\ncannot be larger than one. Here F D az\naz2 has F\n1 D a\n2az: It is easy to check\n|F\n|\n¤ 1 at the limits predicted above. The hard problem--sometimes impossible--\nis to predict what happens above a D 3: Our case is a D 4:\nThe z's cannot approach a limit when\n|F\n1.z\n/ |\n¡1. Something has to happen,\nand there are at least three possibilities:\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nThe zn's can cycle or fill the whole interval .0;1/ or approach a Cantor set.\nI start with a random number z0, take 100 steps, and write down steps 101 to 105:\na D 3:4\na D 3:5\na D 3:8\na D 4:0\nz101 D\n:842\n:875\n:336\n:169\nz102 D\n:452\n:383\n:848\n:562\nz103 D\n:842\n:827\n:491\n:985\nz104 D\n:452\n:501\n:950\n:060\nz105 D\n:842\n:875\n:182\n:225\nThe first column is converging to a \"2-cycle.\" It alternates between x D :842 and\ny D :452: Those satisfy y D F.x/ and x D F.y/ D F.F.x//: If we look at a double\nstep when a D 3:4;x and y are fixed points of the double iteration znC2 D F.F.zn//:\nWhen a increases past 3:45, this cycle becomes unstable.\nAt that point the period doubles from 2 to 4. With a D 3:5 you see a \"4-cycle\" in\nthe table--it repeats after four steps. The sequence bounces from :875 to :383 to :827\nto :501 and back to :875. This cycle must be attractive or we would not see it. But\nit also becomes unstable as a increases. Next comes an 8-cycle, which is stable in\na little window (you could compute it) around a D 3:55: The cycles are stable for\nshorter and shorter intervals of a's. Those stability windows are reduced by the\nFeigenbaum shrinking factor 4:6692.... Cycles of length 16 and 32 and 64 can be\nseen in physical experiments, but they are all unstable before a D 3:57: What happens\nthen ?\nThe new and unexpected behavior is between 3:57 and 4: Down each line of\nFigure 3.24, the computer has plotted the values of z1001 to z2000--omitting the\nfirst thousand points to let a stable period (or chaos) become established. No points\nappearedin the big white wedge. I don't know why. In the window for period3, you\nsee only three z's. Period 3 is followed by 6;12;24; .... There is period doubling\nat the end of every window (including all the windows that are too small to see). You\ncan reproduce this figure by iterating znC1 D azn\naz2\nn from any z0 and plotting the\nresults.\nCANTOR SETS AND FRACTALS\nI can't tell what happens at a D 3:8: There may be a stable cycle of some long period.\nThe z's may come close to every point between 0 and 1: A third possibility is to\napproach a very thin limit set, which looks like the famous Cantor set:\nTo construct the Cantor set, divide Œ0;1 into three pieces and remove the open\ninterval\n3; 2\n\n: Then remove\n9; 2\n\nand\n9; 8\n\nfrom what remains. At each\nstep take out the middle thirds. The points that are left form the Cantor set.\nAll the endpoints 1\n3; 2\n3; 1\n9; 2\n9, ...are in the set. So is 4\n3 (Problem 42). Nevertheless\nthe lengths of the removed intervals add to 1 and the Cantor set has \"measure zero.\"\nWhat is especially striking is its self-similarity: Between 0 and 1\n3 you see the same\nCantor set three times smaller. From 0 to 1\n9 the Cantor set is there again, scaled\ndown by 9: Every section, when blown up, copies the larger picture.\nFractals That self-similarity is typical of a fractal. There is an infinite sequence\nof scales. A mathematical snowflake starts with a triangle and adds a bump in the\nmiddle of each side. At every step the bumps lengthen the sides by 4=3: The final\nboundary is self-similar, like an infinitely long coastline.\n\n3.7\nNewton's Method (and Chaos)\nThe period 2;4; ::: is the number of z's in a cycle.\nFig. 3.24\nPeriod doubling and chaos from iterating F.z/ (stolen by special permission\nfrom Introduction to Applied Mathematics by Gilbert Strang, Wellesley-Cambridge\nPress).\nThe word \"fractal\" comes from fractional dimension. The snowflake boundary\nhas dimension larger than 1 and smaller than 2: The Cantor set has dimension larger\nthan 0 and smaller than 1: Covering an ordinary line segment with circles of radius\nr would take c=r circles. For fractals it takes c=rD circles--and D is the dimension.\nFig. 3.25\nCantor set (middle thirds removed). Fractal snowflake (infinite boundary).\nOur iteration znC1 D 4zn\n4z2\nn has a D 4, at the end of Figure 3.24. The sequence\nz0;z1;...goes everywhere and nowhere. Its behavior is chaotic, and statistical tests\nfind no pattern. For all practical purposes the numbers are random.\nThink what this means in an experiment (or the stock market). If simple rules\nproduce chaos, there is absolutely no way to predict the results. No measurement can\never be sufficiently accurate. The newspapers report that Pluto's orbit is chaotic--\neven though it obeys the law of gravity. The motion is totally unpredictable over\nlong times. I don't know what that does for astronomy (or astrology).\nThe most readable book on this subject is Gleick's best-seller Chaos: Making a\nNew Science. The most dazzling books are The Beauty of Fractals and The Science\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nof Fractal Images, in which Peitgen and Richter and Saupe show photographs that\nhave been in art museums around the world. The most original books are Mandelbrot's\nFractals and Fractal Geometry. Our cover has a fractal from Figure 13.11.\nWe return to friendlier problems in which calculus is not helpless.\nNEWTON'S METHOD VS. SECANT METHOD: CALCULATOR PROGRAMS\nThe hard part of Newton's method is to find df=dx: We need it for the slope of the\ntangent line. But calculus can approximate by f=x--using the values of f .x/\nalready computed at xn and xn 1:\nThe secant method follows the secant line instead of the tangent line:\nSecant W xnC1 D xn\n\nf .xn/\n.f=x/n\nwhere\nf\nx\n\nn\nD f .xn/\nf .xn 1/\nxn\nxn 1\n:\n(13)\nThe secant line connects the two latest points on the graph of f .x/: Its equation\nis y\nf .xn/ D .f=x/.x\nxn/: Set y D 0 to find equation (13) for the new\nx D xnC1, where the line crosses the axis.\nPrediction: Three secant steps are about as good as two Newton steps.

It\nconnects the local picture (slope at a point) to the global picture (average slope\nacross an interval). In other words it relates df=dx to f=x: Calculus depends\non this connection, which we saw first for velocities. If the average velocity is 75, is\nthere a moment when the instantaneous velocity is 75 ?\nFig. 3.26\n(a) v jumps over vaverage: (b) v equals vaverage:\nWithout more information, the answer to that question is no. The velocity could\nbe 100 and then 50--averaging 75 but never equal to 75: If we allow a jump in\nvelocity, it can jump right over its average. At that moment the velocity does not\nexist. (The distance function in Figure 3.26a has no derivative at x D 1:) We will take\naway this cheap escape by requiring a derivative at all points inside the interval.\nIn Figure 3.26b the distance increases by 150 when t increases by 2: There is a\nderivative df=dt at all interior points (but an infinite slope at t D 0). The average\nvelocity is\nf\nt D f .2/\nf .0/\nD 150\n2 D 75:\nThe conclusion of the theorem is that df=dt D 75 at some point inside the\ninterval. There is at least one point where f\n1.c/ D 75:\nThis is not a constructive theorem. The value of c is not known. We don't find c,\nwe just claim (with proof) that such a point exists.\n3M Mean Value Theorem Suppose f .x/ is continuous in the closed interval\na\n¤ x\n¤ b and has a derivative everywhere in the open interval a\nx\nb: Then\nf .b/\nf .a/\nb\na\nD f\n1.c/ at some point a\nc\nb:\n(1)\nThe left side is the average slope f=x: It equals df=dx at c: The notation for a\nclosed interval [with endpoints] is Œa;b: For an open interval (without endpoints) we\nwrite .a;b/: Thus f\n1 is defined in .a;b/, and f remains continuous at a and b: A\nderivative is allowed at those endpoints too--but the theorem doesn't require it.\nThe proof is based on a special case--when f .a/ D 0 and f .b/ D 0: Suppose the\nfunction starts at zero and returns to zero. The average slope or velocity is zero.\nWe have to prove that f\n1.c/ D 0 at a point in between. This special case (keeping the\nassumptions on f .x/) is called Rolle's theorem.\nGeometrically, if f goes away from zero and comes back, then f\n1 D 0 at the turn.\n\nApplications of the Derivative\n3N Rolle's theorem\nSuppose f .a/ D f .b/ D 0 (zero at the ends). Then\nf\n1.c/ D 0 at some point with a\nc\nb:\nProof At a point inside the interval where f .x/ reaches its maximum or minimum,\ndf=dx must be zero. That is an acceptable point c: Figure 3.27a shows the difference\nbetween f D 0 (assumed at a and b) and f\n1 D 0 (proved at c).\nSmall problem: The maximum could be reached at the ends a and b, if f .x/\n0 in\nbetween. At those endpoints df=dx might not be zero. But in that case the minimum\nis reached at an interior point c, which is equally acceptable. The key to our proof is\nthat a continuous function on Œa;b reaches its maximum and minimum. This is\nthe Extreme Value Theorem.\nIt is ironic that Rolle himself did not believe the logic behind calculus. He may not\nhave believed his own theorem! Probably he didn't know what it meant--the language\nof \"evanescent quantities\" (Newton) and \"infinitesimals\" (Leibniz) was exciting but\nfrustrating. Limits were close but never reached. Curves had infinitely many flat sides.\nRolle didn't accept that reasoning, and what was really serious, he didn't accept the\nconclusions. The Academie des Sciences had to stop his battles (he fought against\nordinary mathematicians, not Newton and Leibniz). So he went back to number\ntheory, but his special case when f .a/ D f .b/ D 0 leads directly to the big one.\nFig. 3.27\nRolle's theorem is when f .a/ D f .b/ D 0 in the Mean Value Theorem.\nProof of the Mean Value Theorem We are looking for a point where df=dx equals\nf=x: The idea is to tilt the graph back to Rolle's special case (when f was\nzero). In Figure 3.27b, the distance F.x/ between the curve and the dotted secant line\ncomes from subtraction:\nF.x/ D f .x/\n\nf .a/C f\nx .x\na/\n\n:\n(2)\nAt a and b, this distance is F.a/ D F.b/ D 0: Rolle's theorem applies to F.x/:\nThere is an interior point where F\n1.c/ D 0: At that point take the derivative of equa-\ntion (2): 0 D f\n1.c/\n.f=x/: The desired point c is found, proving the theorem.\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe function f .x/ D\n?x goes from zero at x D 0 to ten at x D 100:\nIts average slope is f=x D 10=100: The derivative f\n1.x/ D 1=2\n?x exists in\nthe open interval .0;100/, even though it blows up at the end x D 0: By the Mean\nValue Theorem there must be a point where 10=100 D f\n1.c/ D 1=2\n?c: That point\nis c D 25:\nIf f .x/ doesn't reach its maximum M; then 1=.M\nf .x// would be continuous but also\napproach infinity. Essential fact: A continuous function on Œa;b cannot approach infinity.\n\n3.8\nThe Mean Value Theorem and l'Hopital's Rule\nThe truth is that nobody cares about the exact value of c: Its existence is what\nmatters. Notice how it affects the linear approximation f .x/\nf .a/Cf\n1.a/.x\n\na/, which was basic to this chapter. Close becomes exact ( becomes D) when f\n1 is\ncomputed at c instead of a:\n3O The derivative at c gives an exact prediction of f .x/:\nf .x/ D f .a/Cf\n1.c/.x\na/:\n(3)\nThe Mean Value Theorem is rewritten here as f D f\n1.c/x: Now a\nc\nx:\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe function f .x/ D sin x starts from f .0/ D 0: The linear\nprediction (tangent line) uses the slope cos 0 D 1: The exact prediction uses the slope\ncos c at an unknown point between 0 and x:\n(approximate) sin x\nx\n(exact) sin x D .cos c/x:\n(4)\nThe approximation is useful, because everything is computed at x D a D 0: The\nexact formula is interesting, because cos c\n¤ 1 proves again that sin x\n¤ x: The\nslope is below 1, so the sine graph stays below the 45\nline.\nEXAMPLE 3\nIf f\n1.c/ D 0 at all points in an interval then f .x/ is constant.\nProof When f\n1 is everywhere zero, the theorem gives f D 0: Every pair of points\nhas f .b/ D f .a/: The graph is a horizontal line. That deceptively simple case is a\nkey to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\nMost applications of f D f\n1.c/x do not end up with a number. They end up\nwith another theorem (like this one). The goal is to connect derivatives (local) to\ndifferences (global). But the next application--l'Hopital's Rule--manages to\nproduce a number out of 0=0:\nL'HOPITAL'S RULE\nWhen f .x/ and g.x/ both approach zero, what happens to their ratio f .x/=g.x/ ?\nf .x/\ng.x/ D x2\nx\nor\nsin x\nx\nor\nx\nsin x\ncos x\nall become\nat\nx D 0:\nSince 0=0 is meaningless, we cannot work separately with f .x/ and g.x/: This is a\n\"race toward zero,\" in which two functions become small while their ratio might do\nanything. The problem is to find the limit of f .x/=g.x/:\nOne such limit is already studied. It is the derivative! f=x automatically builds\nin a race toward zero, whose limit is df=dx:\nf .x/\nf .a/\nN 0\nx\n\na\nN 0\nbut\nlim\nx\nNa\nf .x/\nf .a/\nx\na\nD f\n1.a/:\n(5)\nThe idea of l'Hopital is to use f\n1=g\n1 to handle f=g: The derivative is the special case\ng.x/ D x\na, with g\n1 D 1: The Rule is followed by examples and proofs.\n3P l'Hopital's Rule Suppose f .x/ and g.x/ both approach zero as x\nN a:\nThen f .x/=g.x/ approaches the same limit as f\n1.x/=g\n1.x/, if that second limit\nexists:\nlim\nx\nNa\nf .x/\ng.x/ D lim\nx\nNa\nf\n1.x/\ng\n1.x/ :\nNormally this limit is\nf\n1.a/\ng\n1.a/ :\n(6)\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nFig. 3.28\n(a) f .x/\ng.x/ is exactly f\n1.a/\ng\n1.a/ D 3:\n(b) f .x/\ng.x/ approaches f\n1.a/\ng\n1.a/ D 3:\nThis is not the quotient rule! The derivatives of f .x/ and g.x/ are taken\nseparately. Geometrically, l'Hopital is saying that when functions go to zero their\nslopes control their size. An easy case is f D 6.x\na/ and g D 2.x\na/: The ratio\nf=g is exactly 6=2, the ratio of their slopes. Figure 3.28 shows these straight lines\ndropping to zero, controlled by 6 and 2:\nThe next figure shows the same limit 6=2, when the curves are tangent to the lines.\nThat picture is the key to l'Hopital's rule.\nGenerally the limit of f=g can be a finite number L or C8 or\n8: (Also the limit\npoint x D a can represent a finite number or C8 or\n8: We keep it finite.) The one\nabsolute requirement is that f .x/ and g.x/ must separately approach zero--we insist\non 0=0: Otherwise there is no reason why equation (6) should be true. With f .x/ D x\nand g.x/ D x\n1, don't use l'Hopital:\nf .x/\ng.x/\nN\na\na\nbut\nf\n1.x/\ng\n1.x/ D 1\n1:\nOrdinary ratios approach lim f .x/ divided by lim g.x/: l'Hopital enters only for\n0=0:\nEXAMPLE 4\n(an old friend) lim\nx\nN0\ncos x\nx\nequals lim\nx\nN0\nsin x\n: This equals zero.\nEXAMPLE 5\nf\ng D tan x\nsin x leads to\nf\ng\n1 D sec2x\ncos x : At x D 0 the limit is 1\n1:\nEXAMPLE 6\nf\ng D x\nsin x\ncos x leads to\nf\ng\n1 D 1\ncos x\nsin x\n: At x D 0 this is still 0\n0:\nSolution\nApply the Rule to f\n1=g\n1: It has the same limit as f\n2=g\n2:\nif f\ng\nN 0\nand\nf\ng\nN 0\nthen compute\nf\n2.x/\ng\n2.x/ D sin x\ncos x\nN 0\n1 D 0:\nThe reason behind l'Hopital's Rule is that the following fractions are the\nsame:\nf .x/\ng.x/ D f .x/\nf .a/\nx\na\ng.x/\ng.a/\nx\na\n:\n(7)\nThat is just algebra; the limit hasn't happened yet. The factors x\na cancel, and the\nnumbers f .a/ and g.a/ are zero by assumption. Now take the limit on the right side\nof (7) as x approaches a:\n\n3.8\nThe Mean Value Theorem and l'Hopital's Rule\nWhat normally happens is that one part approaches f\n1 at x D a: The other part\napproaches g\n1.a/: We hope g\n1.a/ is not zero. In this case we can divide one limit by\nthe other limit. That gives the \"normal\" answer\nlim\nx\nNa\nf .x/\ng.x/ D limit of (7) D f\n1.a/\ng\n1.a/ :\n(8)\nThis is also l'Hopital's answer. When f\n1.x/\nN f\n1.a/ and separately g\n1.x/\nN g\n1.a/,\nhis overall limit is f\n1.a/=g\n1.a/: He published this rule in the first textbook ever\nwritten on differential calculus. (That was in 1696--the limit was actually discovered\nby his teacher Bernoulli.) Three hundred years later we apply his name to other cases\npermitted in .6/; when f\n1=g\n1 might approach a limit even if the separate parts do not.\nTo prove this more general form of l'Hopital's Rule, we need a more general Mean\nValue Theorem. I regard the discussion below as optional in a calculus course\n(but required in a calculus book). The important idea already came in equation (8).\nRemark\nThe basic \"indeterminate\" is\n\n8. If f .x/ and g.x/ approach\ninfinity, anything is possible for f .x/\ng.x/: We could have x2\nx or x\nx2 or\n.x C2/\nx: Their limits are\n8 and\n8 and 2:\nAt the next level are 0=0 and\n8= 8 and 0\n\n8: To find the limit in these cases,\ntry l'Hopital's Rule. See Problem 24 when f .x/=g.x/ approaches\n8= 8: When\nf .x/\nN 0 and g.x/\nN\n8, apply the 0=0 rule to f .x/=.1=g.x//:\nThe next level has 00 and 1\n8 and\n80: Those come from limits of f .x/g.x/:\nIf f .x/ approaches 0;1; or\n8 while g.x/ approaches 0;\n8; or 0, we need more\ninformation. A really curious example is x1=lnx, which shows all three possibilities\n00 and 1\n8 and\n80: This function is actually a constant! It equals e:\nTo go back down a level, take logarithms. Then g.x/lnf .x/ returns to 0=0 and\n\n8 and l'Hopital's Rule. But logarithms and e have to wait for Chapter 6.\nTHE GENERALIZED MEAN VALUE THEOREM\nThe MVT can be extended to two functions. The extension is due to Cauchy, who\ncleared up the whole idea of limits. You will recognize the special case g D x as the\nordinary Mean Value Theorem.\n3Q Generalized MVT\nIf f .x/ and g.x/ are continuous on Œa;b and\ndifferentiable on .a;b/, there is a point a\nc\nb where\nŒf .b/\nf .a/g\n1.c/ D Œg.b/\ng.a/f\n1.c/:\n(9)\nThe proof comes by constructing a new function that has F.a/ D F.b/:\nF.x/ D Œf .b/\nf .a/g.x/\nŒg.b/\ng.a/f .x/:\nThe ordinary Mean Value Theorem leads to F\n1.c/ D 0--which is equation (9).\nApplication 1 (Proof of l'Hopital's Rule)\nThe rule deals with f .a/=g.a/ D 0=0:\nInserting those zeros into equation (9) leaves f .b/g\n1.c/ D g.b/f\n1.c/: Therefore\nf .b/\ng.b/ D f\n1.c/\ng\n1.c/ :\n(10)\nAs b approaches a, so does c: The point c is squeezed between a and b: The limit of\nequation (10) as b\nN a and c\nN a is l'Hopital's Rule.\n\nApplications of the Derivative\nApplication 2 (Error in linear approximation)\nSection 3.2 stated that the distance\nbetween a curve and its tangent line grows like .x\na/2: Now we can prove this, and\nfind out more.

      "content": "CHAPTER 4\nDerivatives by the Chain Rule\n4.1 The Chain Rule\nYou remember that the derivative of f .x/g.x/ is not .df=dx/.dg=dx/: The\nderivative of sin x times x2 is not cos x times 2x: The product rule gave two terms,\nnot one term. But there is another way of combining the sine function f and the\nsquaring function g into a single function. The derivative of that new function does\ninvolve the cosine times 2x (but with a certain twist). We will first explain the new\nfunction, and then find the \"chain rule\" for its derivative.\nMay I say here that the chain rule is important. It is easy to learn, and you will\nuse it often. I see it as the third basic way to find derivatives of new functions from\nderivatives of old functions. (So far the old functions are xn, sin x, and cos x: Still\nahead are ex and log x:) When f and g are added and multiplied, derivatives come\nfrom the sum rule and product rule. This section combines f and g in a third way.\nThe new function is sin.x2/--the sine of x2. It is created out of the two original\nfunctions: if x D 3 then x2 D 9 and sin.x2/ D sin 9: There is a \"chain\" of functions,\ncombining sin x and x2 into the composite function sin.x2/: You start with x, then\nfind g.x/, then find f .g.x//:\nThe squaring function gives y D x2: This is g.x/:\nThe sine function produces z D sin y D sin.x2/: This is f .g.x//:\nThe \"inside function\" g.x/ gives y: This is the input to the \"outside function\"\nf .y/: That is called composition. It starts with x and ends with z: The composite\nfunction is sometimes written f\ng (the circle shows the difference from an ordinary\nproduct fg). More often you will see f .g.x//:\nz.x/ D f\ng .x/ D f .g.x//:\n(1)\nOther examples are cos 2x and .2x/3, with g D 2x: On a calculator you input x,\nthen push the \"g\" button, then push the \"f \" button:\nFrom x compute y D g.x/\nFrom y compute z D f .y/.\nThere is not a button for every function! But the squaring function and sine function\nare on most calculators, and they are used in that order. Figure 4.1a shows how\nsquaring will stretch and squeeze the sine function.\n\n4.1\nThe Chain Rule\nThat graph of sin x2 is a crazy FM signal (the Frequency is Modulated). The wave\ngoes up and down like sin x, but not at the same places. Changing to sin g.x/ moves\nthe peaks left and right. Compare with a product g.x/sin x, which is an AM signal\n(the Amplitude is Modulated).\nRemark\nf .g.x// is usually different from g.f .x//: The order of f and g is\nusually important. For f .x/ D sin x and g.x/ D x2, the chain in the opposite order\ng.f .x// gives something different:\nFirst apply the sine function: y D sin x\nThen apply the squaring function: z D .sin x/2:\nThat result is often written sin2x, to save on parentheses. It is never written sin x2,\nwhich is totally different. Compare them in Figure 4.1.\nFig. 4.1\nf .g.x// is different from g.f .x//: Apply g then f , or f then g:\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe composite function f\ng can be deceptive. If g.x/ D x3 and\nf .y/ D y4, how does f .g.x// differ from the ordinary product f .x/g.x/? The\nordinary product is x7: The chain starts with y D x3, and then z D y4 D x12: The\ncomposition of x3 and y4 gives f .g.x// D x12:\nEXAMPLE 2\nIn Newton's method, F.x/ is composed with itself. This is\niteration. Every output xn is fed back as input, to find xnC1 D F.xn/: The example\nF.x/ D 1\n2x C4 has F.F.x// D 1\n2x C4\n\nC4: That produces z D 1\n4x C6:\nThe derivative of F.x/ is 1\n2: The derivative of z D F.F.x// is 1\n4, which is 1\n2 times\n2: We multiply derivatives. This is a special case of the chain rule.\nAn extremely special case is f .x/ D x and g.x/ D x: The ordinary product is x2:\nThe chain f .g.x// produces only x! The output from the \"identity function\" is\ng.x/ D x: When the second identity function operates on x it produces x again.\nThe derivative is 1 times 1: I can give more composite functions in a table:\ny D g.x/\nz D f .y/\nz D f .g.x//\nx2\n?y\n?\nx2\ncos x\ny3\n.cos x/3\n2x\n2y\n22x\nx C5\ny\nx\nA calculator has no button for the identity function. It wouldn't do anything.\n\nDerivatives by the Chain Rule\nThe last one adds 5 to get y: Then it subtracts 5 to reach z: So z D x: Here output\nequals input: f .g.x// D x: These \"inverse functions\" are in Section 4:3: The other\nexamples create new functions z.x/ and we want their derivatives.\nTHE DERIVATIVE OF f.g.x//\nWhat is the derivative of z D sin x2? It is the limit of z=x: Therefore we look at a\nnearby point x Cx: That change in x produces a change in y D x2--which moves\nto y Cy D .x Cx/2: From this change in y, there is a change in z D f .y/: It is a\n\"domino effect,\" in which each changed input yields a changed output: x produces\ny produces z: We have to connect the final z to the original x:\nThe key is to write z=x as z=y times y=x. Then let x approach\nzero. In the limit, dz=dx is given by the \"chain rule\":\nz\nx D z\ny\ny\nx becomes the chain rule dz\ndx D dz\ndy\ndy\ndx :\n(2)\nAs x goes to zero, the ratio y=x approaches dy=dx: Therefore y must be\ngoing to zero, and z=y approaches dz=dy: The limit of a product is the product\nof the separate limits (end of quick proof). We multiply derivatives:\n4A Chain Rule Suppose g.x/ has a derivative at x and f .y/ has a derivative\nat y D g.x/: Then the derivative of z D f .g.x// is\ndz\ndx D dz\ndy\ndy\ndx D f\n1.g.x//g\n1.x/:\n(3)\nThe slope at x is df=dy (at y) times dg=dx (at x).\nCaution The chain rule does not say that the derivative of sin x2 is .cos x/.2x/:\nTrue, cos y is the derivative of sin y: The point is that cos y must be evaluated at y\n(not at x). We do not want df=dx at x, we want df=dy at y D x2:\nThe derivative of sin x2 is .cos x2/ times .2x/:\n(4)\nEXAMPLE 3\nIf z D .sin x/2 then dz=dx D .2sin x/.cos x/: Here y D sin x is inside.\nIn this order, z D y2 leads to dz=dy D 2y: It does not lead to 2x: The inside\nfunction sin x produces dy=dx D cos x: The answer is 2y cos x: We have not yet\nfound the function whose derivative is 2x cos x:\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe derivative of z D sin 3x is dz\ndx D dz\ndy\ndy\ndx D 3 cos 3x:\nFig. 4.2\nThe chain rule: z\nx D z\ny\ny\nx approaches dz\ndx D dz\ndy\ndy\ndx :\n\n4.1\nThe Chain Rule\nThe outside function is z D sin y: The inside function is y D 3x: Then dz=dy D\ncos y--this is cos 3x, not cos x: Remember the other factor dy=dx D 3:\nI can explain that factor 3; especially if x is switched to t: The distance is\nz D sin 3t: That oscillates like sin t except three times as fast. The speeded-up\nfunction sin 3t completes a wave at time 2=3 (instead of 2). Naturally the\nvelocity contains the extra factor 3 from the chain rule.\nEXAMPLE 5\nLet z D f .y/ D yn: Find the derivative of f .g.x// D Œg.x/n:\nIn this case dz=dy is nyn 1: The chain rule multiplies by dy=dx:\ndz\ndx D nyn 1 dy\ndx\nor\nd\ndx Œg.x/n D nŒg.x/n 1dg\ndx :\n(5)\nThis is the power rule! It was already discovered in Section 2:5: Square roots (when\nn D 1=2) are frequent and important.

How many gallons per hour?\nAnswer\n.Gallons=hour/ D .gallons=mile/.miles=hour/: The chain rule is\n.dy=dt/ D .dy=dx/.dx=dt/: The answer is .1=20/.60/ D 3 gallons=hour:\nProof of the chain rule The discussion above was correctly based on\nz\nx D z\ny\ny\nx\nand\ndz\ndx D dz\ndy\ndy\ndx :\n(7)\nIt was here, over the chain rule, that the \"battle of notation\" was won by Leibniz.\nHis notation practically tells you what to do: Take the limit of each term. (I have to\nmention that when x is approaching zero, it is theoretically possible that y might\nhit zero. If that happens, z=y becomes 0=0: We have to assign it the correct\nmeaning, which is dz=dy:) As x\nN 0,\ny\nx\nN g\n1.x/\nand\nz\ny\nN f\n1.y/ D f\n1.g.x//:\nThen z=x approachesf\n1.y/ times g\n1.x/, which is the chain rule .dz=dy/.dy=dx/:\nIn the table below, the derivative of .sin x/3 is 3.sin x/2 cos x: That extra factor\ncos x is easy to forget. It is even easier to forget the\n1 in the last example.\nz D .x3 C1/5\ndz=dx D 5.x3C1/4\ntimes 3x2\nz D .sin x/3\ndz=dx D 3sin2x\ntimes cos x\nz D .1\nx/2\ndz=dx D 2.1\nx/\ntimes\nImportant\nAll kinds of letters are used for the chain rule. We named the output z:\nVery often it is called y, and the inside function is called u:\nThe derivative of y D sin u.x/ is dy\ndx D cos udu\ndx :\nExamples with du=dx are extremely common. I have to ask you to accept whatever\nletters may come. What never changes is the key idea--derivative of outside function\ntimes derivative of inside function.\n\nDerivatives by the Chain Rule\nEXAMPLE 6\nThe chain rule is barely needed for sin.x\n1/: Strictly speaking the\ninside function is u D x\n1: Then du=dx is just 1 (not\n1). If y D sin.x\n1/ then\ndy=dx D cos.x\n1/: The graph is shifted and the slope shifts too.\nNotice especially: The cosine is computed at x\n1 and not at the unshifted x:\nRECOGNIZING f.y/ AND g.x/\nA big part of the chain rule is recognizing the chain. The table started with .x3 C1/5:\nYou look at it for a second. Then you see it as u5: The inside function is u D x3 C1:\nWith practice this decomposition (the opposite of composition) gets easy:\ncos.2x C1/ is cos u\n?\n1Csin t is\n?\nu\nx sin x is ::: (product rule!)\nIn calculations, the careful way is to write down all the functions:\nz D cos u\nu D 2x C1\ndz=dx D . sin u/.2/ D\n2sin.2x C1/:\nThe quick way is to keep in your mind \"the derivative of what's inside.\" The\nslope of cos.2x C1/ is\nsin.2x C1/, times 2 from the chain rule. The derivative\nof 2x C1 is remembered--without z or u or f or g:\nEXAMPLE 7\nsin\n?\nx is a chain of z D sin y; y D\n?u;u D 1\nx (three functions).\nWith that triple chain you will have the hang of the chain rule:\nThe derivative of sin\n?\nx is .cos\n?\nx/\n\n?\nx\n\n. 1/:\nThis is .dz=dy/.dy=du/.du=dx/: Evaluate them at the right places y;u;x:\nFinally there is the question of second derivatives. The chain rule gives dz=dx as\na product, so d 2z=dx2 needs the product rule:\ndz\ndx D dz\ndy\ndy\ndx\nleads to\nd 2z\ndx2 D dz\ndy\nd 2y\ndx2 C d\ndx\ndz\ndy\ndy\ndx :\n(8)\nu\nv\nu\nv\n1 C\nu\nv\nThat last term needs the chain rule again. It becomes d 2z=dy2 times .dy=dx/2:\nEXAMPLE 8\nThe derivative of sin x2 is 2x cos x2: Then the product rule gives\nd 2z=dx2 D 2 cos x2\n4x2sin x2: In this case y\n2 D 2 and .y\n1/2 D 4x2:\n4.1\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nz D f .g.x// comes from z D f .y/ and y D\na\n.

We want to know dy=dx at a typical point.\nFor xy D 2 that is no trouble, but the slope of y5 Cxy D 3 requires a new idea.\nIn the first case, solve for y D 2=x and take its derivative: dy=dx D\n2=x2: The\ncurve is a hyperbola. At x D 2 the slope is\n2=4 D\n1=2:\nThe problem with y5 Cxy D 3 is that it can't be solved for y: Galois proved that\nthere is no solution formula for fifth-degree equations. The function y.x/ cannot\nbe given explicitly. All we have is the implicit definition of y, as a solution to\ny5 Cxy D 3: The point x D 2, y D 1 satisfies the equation and lies on the curve,\nbut how to find dy=dx?\nThis section answers that question. It is a situation that often occurs. Equations like\nsin y Csin x D 1 or y sin y D x (maybe even sin y D x) are difficult or impossible\nto solve directly for y: Nevertheless we can find dy=dx at any point.\nThe way out is implicit differentiation. Work with the equation as it stands. Find\nthe x derivative of every term in y5 Cxy D 3. That includes the constant term 3;\nwhose derivative is zero.\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe power rule for y5 and the product rule for xy yield\n5y4 dy\ndx Cx dy\ndx Cy D 0:\n(1)\nNow substitute the typical point x D 2 and y D 1, and solve for dy=dx:\n5 dy\ndx C2 dy\ndx C1 D 0\nproduces\ndy\ndx D\n7:\n(2)\nThis is implicit differentiation (ID), and you see the idea: Include dy=dx from the\nchain rule, even if y is not known explicitly as a function of x:\nEXAMPLE 2\nsin y Csin x D 1 leads to cos y dy\ndx Ccos x D 0\nEXAMPLE 3\ny sin y D x leads to y cos y dy\ndx D sin y dy\ndx D 1\nKnowing the slope makes it easier to draw the curve. We still need points .x;y/\nthat satisfy the equation. Sometimes we can solve for x: Dividing y5 Cxy D 3 by y\ngives x D 3=y\ny4: Now the derivative (the x derivative!) is\n1 D\n\ny2\n4y3\ndy\ndx D\n7 dy\ndx at y D 1:\n(3)\nAgain dy=dx D\n1=7: All these examples confirm the main point of the section:\n4B (Implicit differentiation) An equation F.x;y/ D 0 can be differentiated\ndirectly by the chain rule, without solving for y in terms of x:\nThe example xy D 2, done implicitly, gives x dy=dx Cy D 0: The slope dy=dx is\ny=x: That agrees with the explicit slope\n2=x2:\nID is explained better by examples than theory (maybe everything is). The essential\ntheory can be boiled down to one idea: \"Go ahead and differentiate.\"\nThat was before he went to the famous duel, and met his end.

They\nseem to fit here--as applications of the chain rule. The problem is to compute\ndf=dt, but the odd thing is that we are given another derivative dg=dt: To find\ndf=dt, we need a relation between f and g:\nThe chain rule is df=dt D .df=dg/.dg=dt/: Here the variable is t because that\nis typical in applications. From the rate of change of g we find the rate of change of\nf: This is the problem of related rates, and examples will make the point.\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe radius of a circle is growing by dr=dt D 7: How fast is the\ncircumference growing?

It occurs when f .y/ and g.x/ are\n\"inverse functions.\" That idea is expressed by a very short and powerful equation:\nf .g.x// D x: Here is what that means.\nInverse functions: Start with any input, say x D 5: Compute y D g.x/, say\ny D 3: Then compute f .y/, and the answer must be 5. What one function does,\nthe inverse function undoes. If g.5/ D 3 then f .3/ D 5: The inverse function f\ntakes the output y back to the input x.\nEXAMPLE 1\ng.x/ D x\n2 and f .y/ D y C2 are inverse functions. Starting with\nx D 5, the function g subtracts 2: That produces y D 3: Then the function f adds 2:\nThat brings back x D 5. To say it directly: The inverse of y D x\n2 is x D y C2.\nEXAMPLE 2\ny D g.x/ D 5\n9.x\n32/\nand\nx D f .y/ D 9\n5y C32\nare\ninverse\nfunctions (for temperature). Here x is degrees Fahrenheit and y is degrees Celsius.\nFrom x D 32 (freezing in Fahrenheit) you find y D 0 (freezing in Celsius). The\ninverse function takes y D 0 back to x D 32: Figure 4.4 shows how x D 50\nF\nmatches y D 10\nC.\nNotice that 5\n9.x\n32/ subtracts 32 first. The inverse 9\n5y C32 adds 32 last. In the\nsame way g multiplies last by 5\n9 while f multiplies first by 9\n5:\nFig. 4.4\nF to\nC to\nF. Always g\n1.g.x//D x and g.g\n1 D .y// D y: If f D g\n1 then\ng D f\n1:\nThe inverse function is written f D g\n1 and pronounced \"g inverse.\" It is not\n1=g.x/:\nIf the demand y is a function of the price x, then the price is a function of the demand.\nThose are inverse functions. Their derivatives obey a fundamental rule: dy=dx\ntimes dx=dy equals 1. In Example 2, dy=dx is 5=9 and dx=dy is 9=5:\nThere is another important point. When f and g are applied in the opposite\norder, they still come back to the start. First f adds 2, then g subtracts 2: The chain\ng.f .y// D .yC2/\n2 brings back y: If f is the inverse of g then g is the inverse\nof f . The relation is completely symmetric, and so is the definition:\nInverse function: If y D g.x/ then x D g\n1.y/: If x D g\n1.y/ then y D g.x/:\nThe loop in the figure goes from x to y to x: The composition g\n1.g.x// is the\n\"identity function.\" Instead of a new point z it returns to the original x: This will\nmake the chain rule particularly easy--leading to .dy=dx/.dx=dy/ D 1:\nEXAMPLE 3\ny D g.x/ D\n?x and x D f .y/ D y2 are inverse functions.\nStarting from x D 9 we find y D 3: The inverse gives 32 D 9: The square of\n?x is\nf .g.x// D x: In the opposite direction, the square root of y2 is g.f .y// D y:\n\n4.3\nInverse Functions and Their Derivatives\nCaution That example does not allow x to be negative. The domain of g--the set\nof numbers with square roots--is restricted to x\n¥ 0: This matches the range of\ng\n1: The outputs y2 are nonnegative. With domain of g D range of g\n1, the\nequation x D .\n?x/2 is possible and true. The nonnegative x goes into g and comes\nout of g\n1:\nIn this example y is also nonnegative. You might think we could square anything,\nbut y must come back as the square root of y2: So y\n¥ 0:\nTo summarize: The domain of a function matches the range of its inverse. The\ninputs to g\n1 are the outputs from g: The inputs to g are the outputs from g\n1:\nIf g.x/ D y then solving that equation for x gives x D g\n1.y/:\nif y D 3x\nthen x D 1\n3.y C6/\n.this is g\n1.y//\nif y D x3 C1\nthen x D\n?y\n.this is g\n1.y//\nIn practice that is how g\n1 is computed: Solve g.x/ D y: This is the reason inverses\nare important. Every time we solve an equation we are computing a value of g\n1:\nNot all equations have one solution. Not all functions have inverses. For\neach y, the equation g.x/ D y is only allowed to produce one x: That solution is\nx D g\n1.y/: If there is a second solution, then g\n1 will not be a function--because\na function cannot produce two x's from the same y:\nEXAMPLE 4\nThere is more than one solution to sin x D 1\n2: Many angles have the\nsame sine. On the interval 0\n¤ x\n¤ , the inverse of y D sin x is not a function.\nFigure 4.5 shows how two x's give the same y:\nPrevent x from passing =2 and the sine has an inverse. Write x D sin\n1y:\nThe function g has no inverse if two points x1 and x2 give g.x1/ D g.x2/. Its\ninverse would have to bring the same y back to x1 and x2: No function can do that;\ng\n1.y/ cannot equal both xl and x2: There must be only one x for each y:\nTo be invertible over an interval, g must be steadily increasing or steadily decreasing.\nFig. 4.5\nInverse exists (one x for each y). No inverse function (two x's for one y).\nTHE DERIVATIVE OF g\nIt is time for calculus. Forgive me for this very humble example.\nEXAMPLE 5\n(ordinary multiplication) The inverse of y D g.x/ D 3x is x D f .y/ D 1\n3y:\nThis shows with special clarity the rule for derivatives: The slopes dy=dx D 3 and\ndx=dy D 1\n3 multiply to give 1: This rule holds for all inverse functions, even if their\nslopes are not constant. It is a crucial application of the chain rule to the derivative\nof f .g.x// D x:\n\nDerivatives by the Chain Rule\n4C (Derivative of inverse function)\nFrom f .g.x// D x the chain rule gives\nf\n1.g.x//g\n1.x/ D 1: Writing y D g.x/ and x D f .y/, this rule looks better:\ndx\ndy\ndy\ndx D 1\nor\ndx\ndy D\ndy=dx :\n(1)\nThe slope of x D g\n1.y/ times the slope of y D g.x/ equals one.\nThis is the chain rule with a special feature. Since f .g.x// D x, the derivative of\nboth sides is 1: If we know g\n1 we now know f\n1: That rule will be tested on a\nfamiliar example. In the next section it leads to totally new derivatives.\nEXAMPLE 6\nThe inverse of y D x3 is x D y1=3: We can find dx=dy two ways:\ndirectly W dx\ndy D 1\n3y\n2=3\nindirectly W dx\ndy D\ndy=dx D\n3x2 D\n3y2=3 :\nThe equation .dx=dy/.dy=dx/ D 1 is not ordinary algebra, but it is true. Those\nderivatives are limits of fractions. The fractions are .x=y/.y=x/ D 1 and\nwe let x\nN 0:\nFig. 4.6\nGraphs of inverse functions: x D 1\n3y is the mirror image of y D 3x:\nBefore going to new functions, I want to draw graphs. Figure 4.6 shows y D\n?x\nand y D 3x: What is special is that the same graphs also show the inverse functions.\nThe inverse of y D\n?x is x D y2: The pair x D 4;y D 2 is the same for both. That is\nthe whole point of inverse functions--if 2 D g.4/ then 4 D g\n1(2). Notice that the\ngraphs go steadily up.\nThe only problem is, the graph of x D g\n1.y/ is on its side. To change the slope\nfrom 3 to 1\n3, you would have to turn the figure. After that turn there is another\nproblem--the axes don't point to the right and up. You also have to look in a mirror!\n(The typesetter refused to print the letters backward. He thinks it's crazy but it's not.)\nTo keep the book in position, and the typesetter in position, we need a better idea.\nThe graph of x D 1\n3y comes from turning the picture across the 45\nline. The y\naxis becomes horizontal and x goes upward. The point .2;6/ on the line y D 3x goes\ninto the point .6;2/ on the line x D 1\n3y: The eyes see a reflection across the 45\nline\n(Figure 4.6c). The mathematics sees the same pairs x and y: The special properties\nof g and g\n1 allow us to know two functions--and draw two graphs--at the same\ntime. The graph of x D g\n1.y/ is the mirror image of the graph of y D g.x/.\nI have seen graphs with y D g.x/ and also y D g\n1.x/: For me that is wrong: it has to be\nx D g\n1.y/: If y D sin x then x D sin\n1y:\n\n4.3\nInverse Functions and Their Derivatives\nEXPONENTIALS AND LOGARITHMS\nI would like to add two more examples of inverse functions, because they are so\nimportant. Both examples involve the exponential and the logarithm. One is made\nup of linear pieces that imitate 2x; it appeared in Chapter 1: The other is the true\nfunction 2x, which is not yet defined--and it is not going to be defined here. The\nfunctions bx and logb y are so overwhelmingly important that they deserve and will\nget a whole chapter of the book (at least). But you have to see the graphs.\nThe slopes in the linear model are powers of 2: So are the heights y at the start\nof each piece. The slopes 1;2;4; ::: equal the heights 1;2;4;::: at those special\npoints.\nThe inverse is a discrete model for the logarithm (to base 2). The logarithm of 1\nis 0, because 20 D 1: The logarithm of 2 is 1, because 21 D 2: The logarithm of 2j\nis the exponent j: Thus the model gives the correct x D log2 y at the breakpoints\ny D 1;2;4;8; :::: The slopes are 1; 1\n2; 1\n4; 1\n8;::: because dx=dy D 1=.dy=dx/:\nThe model is good, but the real thing is better. The figure on the right shows the\ntrue exponential y D 2x: At x D 0;1;2; ::: the heights y are the same as before. But\nnow the height at x D 1\n2 is the number 21=2, which is\n?\n2: The height at x D :10\nis the tenth root 21=10 D 1:07:::: The slope at x D 0 is no longer 1--it is closer to\ny=x D :07=:10: The exact slope is a number c (near .7) that we are not\nyet prepared to reveal.\nThe special property of y D 2x is that the slope at all points is cy: The slope is\nproportional to the function. The exponential solves dy=dx D cy:\nNow look at the inverse function--the logarithm. Its graph is the mirror image:\nIf y D 2x then x D log2 y: If 21=10\n1:07 then log2 1:07\n1=10:\nWhat the exponential does, the logarithm undoes--and vice versa. The logarithm of\n2x is the exponent x. Since the exponential starts with slope c, the logarithm must\nstart with slope 1=c: Check that numerically. The logarithm of 1:07 is near 1=10: The\nslope is near .10=:07: The beautiful property is that dx=dy D 1=cy:\nFig. 4.7\nPiecewise linear models and smooth curves: y D 2x and x D log2 y: Base b D 2:\nI have to mention that calculus avoids logarithms to base 2: The reason lies\nin that mysterious number c: It is the \"natural logarithm\" of 2, which is .693147:::\n--and who wants that? Also 1=:693147::: enters the slope of log2 y: Then\n.dx=dy/.dy=dx/ D 1: The right choice is to use \"natural logarithms\" throughout.\nIn place of 2, they are based on the special number e:\ny D ex is the inverse of x D ln y:\n(2)\n\nDerivatives by the Chain Rule\nThe derivatives of those functions are sensational--they are saved for Chapter 6.\nTogether with xn and sin x and cos x, they are the backbone of calculus.\nNote\nIt is almost possible to go directly to Chapter 6: The inverse functions\nx D sin\n1y and x D tan\n1y can be done quickly. The reason for including integrals\nfirst (Chapter 5) is that they solve differential equations with no guesswork:\ndy\ndx D y\nor\ndx\ndy D 1\ny\nleads to\n»\ndx D\n» dy\ny\nor\nx D ln y CC:\nIntegrals have applications of all kinds, spread through the rest of the book. But do\nnot lose sight of 2x and ex: They solve dy=dx D cy--the key to applied calculus.\nTHE INVERSE OF A CHAIN h.g.x//\nThe functions g.x/ D x\n2 and h.y/ D 3y were easy to invert. For g\n1 we added 2,\nand for h\n1 we divided by 3: Now the question is: If we create the composite function\nz D h.g.x//, or z D 3.x\n2/, what is its inverse?\nVirtually all known functions are created in this way, from chains of simpler\nfunctions. The problem is to invert a chain using the inverse of each piece. The\nanswer is one of the fundamental rules of mathematics:\n4D The inverse of z D h.g.x// is a chain of inverses in the opposite order:\nx D g\n1.h\n1.z//:\n(3)\nh\n1 is applied first because h was applied last: g\n1.h\n1.h.g.x//// D x:\nThat last equation looks like a mess, but it holds the key. In the middle you see\nh\n1 and h: That part of the chain does nothing! The inverse functions cancel, to\nleave g\n1.g.x//: But that is x. The whole chain collapses, when g\n1 and h\n1 are\nin the correct order--which is opposite to the order of h.g.x//:\nEXAMPLE 7\nz D h.g.x// D 3.x\n2/ and x D g\n1.h\n1.z// D 1\n3z C2:\nFirst h\n1 divides by 3: Then g\n1 adds 2: The inverse of h\ng is g\nh\n1: It can\nbe found directly by solving z D 3.x\n2/. A chain of inverses is like writing in\nprose--we do it without knowing it.\nEXAMPLE 8\nInvert z D\n?\nx\n2 by writing z2 D x\n2 and then x D z2 C2:\nThe inverse adds 2 and takes the square--but not in that order. That would give\n.z C2/2, which is wrong. The correct order is z2 C2:\nThe domains and ranges are explained by Figure 4.8. We start with x\n¥ 2:\nSubtracting 2 gives y\n¥ 0: Taking the square root gives z\n¥ 0: Taking the square\nbrings back y\n¥ 0: Adding 2 brings back x\n¥ 2--which is in the original domain\nof g:\nFig. 4.8\nThe chain g\n1.h\n1.h.g.x////D x is one-to-one at every step.\n\n4.3\nInverse Functions and Their Derivatives\nEXAMPLE 9\nInverse matrices .AB/\n1 D B\n1A\n(this linear algebra is optional).\nSuppose a vector x is multiplied by a square matrix B: y D g.x/ D Bx: The inverse\nfunction multiplies by the inverse matrix: x D g\n1.y/ D B\n1y: It is like\nmultiplication by B D 3 and B\n1 D 1=3, except that x and y are vectors.\nNow supposea secondfunctionmultiplies by anothermatrix A: z D h.g.x// D ABx:\nThe problem is to recover x from z: The first step is to invert A, because that came\nlast: Bx D A\n1z: Then the second step multiplies by B\n1 and brings back\nx D B\n1A\n1z: The product B\n1A\n1 inverts the product AB. The rule for matrix\ninverses is like the rule for function inverses--in fact it is a special case.\nI had better not wander too far from calculus. The next section introduces the\ninverses of the sine and cosine and tangent, and finds their derivatives. Remember\nthat the ultimate source is the chain rule.\n4.3\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe\nfunctions\ng.x/D x\nand\nf .y/ D y C4\nare\na\nfunctions, because f .g.x//D\nb\n.

Therefore it is totally natural to invert the sine function. The graph of\nx D sin\n1y is a mirror image of y D sin x: This is a case where we pay close\nattention to the domains, since the sine goes up and down infinitely often. We only\nwant one piece of that curve, in Figure 4.9.\nFor the bold line the domain is restricted. The angle x lies between\n=2\nand C=2. On that interval the sine is increasing, so each y comes from exactly\none angle x. If the whole sine curve is allowed, infinitely many angles would have\nsin x D 0: The sine function could not have an inverse. By restricting to an interval\nwhere sin x is increasing, we make the function invertible.\nFig. 4.9\nGraphs of sin x and sin\n1y: Their slopes are cos x and 1=\na\ny2:\nThe inverse function brings y back to x: It is x D sin\n1y (the inverse sine):\nx D sin\n1y when y D sin x and\n|x\n|\n¤ =2:\n(1)\nThe inverse starts with a number y between\n1 and 1: It produces an angle x D\nsin\n1y--the angle whose sine is y. The angle x is between\n=2 and =2, with\nthe required sine. Historically x was called the \"arc sine\" of y, and arcsin is used in\ncomputing.The mathematical notation is sin\n1: This has nothing to do with 1=sin x.\nThe figure shows the 30\nangle x D =6: Its sine is y D 1\n2: The inverse sine of 1\nis =6. Again: The symbol sin\n1.1/ stands for the angle whose sine is 1 (this angle\nis x D =2). We are seeing g\n1.g.x// D x:\nsin\n1.sin x/ D x for\n\n¤ x\n¤\nsin.sin\n1y/ D y for\n¤ y\n¤ 1:\nEXAMPLE 1\n(important) If sin x D y find a formula for cos x:\nSolution\nWe are given the sine, we want the cosine. The key to this problem must\nbe cos2x D 1\nsin2x: When the sine is y, the cosine is the square root of 1\ny2:\ncos x D cos.sin\n1y/ D\na\ny2:\n(2)\nThis formula is crucial for computing derivatives. We use it immediately.\n\nDerivatives by the Chain Rule\nTHE DERIVATIVE OF THE INVERSE SINE\nThe calculus problem is to find the slope of the inverse function f .y/ D sin\n1y:\nThe chain rule gives (slope of inverse function) D 1=(slope of original function).\nCertainly the slope of sin x is cos x: To switch from x to y, use equation (2):\ny D sin x gives dy\ndx D cos x so that dx\ndy D\ncos x D\na\ny2:\n(3)\nThis derivative 1=\na\ny2 gives a new v-f pair that is extremely valuable in\ncalculus:\nvelocity\nv.t/ D 1=\na\nt2\ndistance\nf .t/ D sin\n1t:\nInverse functions will soon produce two more pairs, from the derivatives of tan\n1y\nand sec\n1y: The table at the end lists all the essential facts.\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe slope of sin\n1y at y D 1 is infinite: 1=\na\ny2 D 1=0: Explain.\nAt y D 1 the graph of y D sin x is horizontal. The slope is zero. So its mirror image\nis vertical. The slope 1=0 is an extreme case of the chain rule.\nQuestion What is d=dx.sin\n1x/?\nAnswer 1=\n?\nx2: I just changed letters.\nTHE INVERSE COSINE AND ITS DERIVATIVE\nWhatever is done for the sine can be done for the cosine. But the domain and range\nhave to be watched. The graph cannot be allowed to go up and down. Each y from\n1 to 1 should be the cosine of only one angle x: That puts x between 0 and :\nThen the cosine is steadily decreasing and y D cos x has an inverse:\ncos\n1.cos x/ D x and cos.cos\n1y/ D y:\n(4)\nThe cosine of the angle x D 0 is the number y D 1: The inverse cosine of y D 1 is the\nangle x D 0: Those both express the same fact, that cos 0 D 1:\nFor the slope of cos\n1y, we could copy the calculation that succeeded for sin\n1y:\nThe chain rule could be applied as in (3). But there is a faster way, because of a special\nrelation between cos\n1y and sin\n1y: Those angles always add to a right angle:\ncos\n1y Csin\n1y D =2:\n(5)\nFigure 4.9c shows the angles and Figure 4.10c shows the graphs. The sum is =2 (the\ndotted line), and its derivative is zero. So the derivatives of cos\n1y and sin\n1y must\nadd to zero. Those derivatives have opposite sign. There is a minus for the inverse\ncosine, and its graph goes downward:\nThe derivative of x D cos\n1y\nis\ndx=dy D\n1=\na\ny2:\n(6)\nQuestion\nHow can two functions x D sin\n1y and x D\ncos\n1y have the same\nderivative?\nAnswer\nsin\n1y must be the same as\ncos\n1y CC: Equation (5) gives C D =2:\n\n4.4\nInverses of Trigonometric Functions\nFig. 4.10\nThe graphs of y D cos x and x D cos\n1y: Notice the domain 0\n¤ x\n¤ :\nTHE INVERSE TANGENT AND ITS DERIVATIVE\nThe tangent is sin x=cos x: The inverse tangent is not sin\n1y=cos\n1y: The inverse\nfunction produces the angle whose tangent is y: Figure 4.11 shows that angle, which\nis between\n=2 and =2: The tangent can be any number, but the inverse tangent is\nin the open interval\n=2\nx\n=2: (The interval is \"open\" because its endpoints\nare not included.) The tangents of =2 and\n=2 are not defined.\nThe slope of y D tan x is dy=dx D sec2x: What is the slope of x D tan\n1y?\nBy the chain rule dx\ndy D\nsec2x D\n1Ctan2x D\n1Cy2:\n(7)\n4E The derivative of f .y/ D tan\n1y is df\ndy D\n1Cy2 :\n(8)\nFig. 4.11\nx D tan\n1y has slope 1=.1Cy2/: x D sec\n1y has slope 1=|y\n|\na\ny2\n1:\nEXAMPLE 3\nThe tangent of x D =4 is y D 1: We check slopes.

That gives the middle equation in (10):\nThe derivatives of cot\n1y and sec\n1y and csc\n1y are\nd\ndy .cot\n1y/ D\n1Cy2\nd\ndy .sec\n1y/ D\n|y\n|\na\ny2\nd\ndy .csc\n1y/ D\n|y\n|\na\ny2\n: (10)\nNote about the inverse secant\nWhen y is negative there is a choice for x D sec\n1y:\nWe selected the angle in the second quadrant (between =2 and ). Its cosine is\nnegative, so its secant is negative. This choice makes sec\n1y D cos\n1.1=y/, which\nmatches sec x D 1=cos x: It also makes sec\n1y an increasing function, where cos\n1y\nis a decreasing function. So we needed the absolute value\n|y\n| in the derivative.\nSome mathematical tables make a different choice. The angle x could be in the\nthird quadrant (between\nand\n=2). Then the slope omits the absolute value.\nSummary\nFor the six inverse functions it is only necessary to learn three\nderivatives. The other three just have minus signs, as we saw for sin\n1y and cos\n1y:\nEach inverse function and its \"cofunction\" add to =2, so their derivatives add to\nzero.

      "content": "CHAPTER 5\nIntegrals\n5.1 The Idea of the Integral\nThis chapter is about the idea of integration, and also about the technique of\nintegration. We explain how it is done in principle, and then how it is done in\npractice. Integration is a problem of adding up infinitely many things, each of which\nis infinitesimally small. Doing the addition is not recommended. The whole point of\ncalculus is to offer a better way.\nThe problem of integration is to find a limit of sums. The key is to work backward\nfrom a limit of differences (which is the derivative). We can integrate v.x/ if it\nturns up as the derivative of another function f .x/. The integral of v D cos x is\nf D sin x. The integral of v D x is f D 1\n2x2. Basically, f .x/ is an \"antiderivative\".\nThe list of f 's will grow much longer (Section 5:4 is crucial). A selection is inside\nthe cover of this book. If we don't find a suitable f .x/, numerical integration can still\ngive an excellent answer.\nI could go directly to the formulas for integrals, which allow you to compute areas\nunder the most amazing curves. (Area is the clearest example of adding up infinitely\nmany infinitely thin rectangles, so it always comes first. It is certainly not the only\nproblem that integral calculus can solve.) But I am really unwilling just to write down\nformulas, and skip over all the ideas. Newton and Leibniz had an absolutely brilliant\nintuition, and there is no reason why we can't share it.\nThey started with something simple. We will do the same.\nSUMS AND DIFFERENCES\nIntegrals and derivatives can be mostly explained by working (very briefly) with\nsums and differences. Instead of functions, we have n ordinary numbers. The key\nidea is nothing more than a basic fact of algebra. In the limit as n\nN\n8, it becomes\nthe basic fact of calculus. The step of \"going to the limit\" is the essential difference\nbetween algebra and calculus! It has to be taken, in order to add up infinitely many\ninfinitesimals--but we start out this side of it.\nTo see what happens before the limiting step, we need two sets of n numbers. The\nfirst set will be v1;v2; :::;vn, where v suggests velocity. The second set of numbers\nwill be f1;f2; :::;fn; where f recalls the idea of distance. You might think d would\nbe a better symbol for distance, but that is needed for the dx and dy of calculus.\n\nIntegrals\nA first example has n D 4:\nv1;v2;v3;v4 D 1;2;3;4\nf1;f2;f3;f4 D 1;3;6;10:\nThe relation between the v's and f 's is seen in that example. When you are given\n1;3;6;10; how do you produce 1;2;3;4? By taking differences. The difference\nbetween 10 and 6 is 4. Subtracting 6\n3 is 3. The difference f2\nf1 D 3\n1 is\nv2 D 2. Each v is the difference between two f 's:\nvj is the differencefj\nfj\n1:\nThis is the discrete form of the derivative. I admit to a small difficulty at j D 1,\nfrom the fact that there is no f0. The first v should be f1\nf0, and the natural idea\nis to agree that f0 is zero. This need for a starting point will come back to haunt us\n(or help us) in calculus.\nNow look again at those same numbers--but start with v. From v D 1;2;3;4 how\ndo you produce f D 1;3;6;10? By taking sums. The first two v's add to 3, which is\nf2. The first three v's add to f3 D 6. The sum of all four v's is 1C2C3C4 D 10.\nTaking sums is the opposite of taking differences.\nThat idea from algebra is the key to calculus. The sum fj involves all the numbers\nv1 Cv2 C\n\nCvj . The difference vj involves only the two numbers fj\nfj\n1. The\nfact that one reverses the other is the \"Fundamental Theorem.\" Calculus will change\nsums to integrals and differences to derivatives--but why not let the key idea come\nthrough now?\n5A Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (before limits):\nIf each vj D fj\nfj\n1; then v1 Cv2 C\n\nCvn D fn\nf0:\nThe differences of the f 's add up to fn\nf0. All f 's in between are canceled, leaving\nonly the last fn and the starting f0. The sum \"telescopes\":\nv1 Cv2 Cv3 C\n\nCvn D .f1\nf0/C.f2\nf1/C.f3\nf2/C\n\nC.fn\nfn 1/:\nThe number f1 is canceled by\nf1. Similarly\nf2 cancels f2 and\nf3 cancels f3.\nEventually fn and\nf0 are left. When f0 is zero, the sum is the final fn.\nThat completes the algebra. We add the v's by finding the f 's.\nQuestion How do you add the odd numbers 1C3C5C\n\nC99 (the v's)?\nAnswer\nThey are the differences between 0;1;4;9; :::: These f 's are squares. By\nthe Fundamental Theorem, the sum of 50 odd numbers is .50/2.\nThe tricky part is to discover the right f 's! Their differences must produce the v's.\nIn calculus, the tricky part is to find the right f .x/. Its derivative must produce v.x/.\nIt is remarkable how often f can be found--more often for integrals than for sums.\nOur next step is to understand how the integral is a limit of sums.\nSUMS APPROACH INTEGRALS\nSuppose you start a successful company. The rate of income is increasing. After x\nyears, the income per year is\n?x million dollars. In the first four years you reach\n?\n1;\n?\n2;\n?\n3; and\n?\n4 million dollars. Those numbers are displayed in a bar graph\n(Figure 5.1a, for investors). I realize that most start-up companies make losses, but\nyour company is an exception. If the example is too good to be true, please keep\nreading.\n\n5.1\nThe Idea of the Integral\nFig. 5.1\nTotal income D total area of rectangles D 6:15.\nThe graph shows four rectangles, of heights\n?\n1;\n?\n2;\n?\n3;\n?\n4. Since the base of\neach rectangle is one year, those numbers are also the areas of the rectangles. One\ninvestor, possibly weak in arithmetic, asks a simple question: What is the total\nincome for all four years? There are two ways to answer, and I will give both.\nThe first answer is\n?\n1C\n?\n2C\n?\n3C\n?\n4. Addition gives 6:15 million dollars.\nFigure 5.1b shows this total--which is reached at year 4. This is exactly like\nvelocities and distances, but now v is the income per year and f is the total income.\nAlgebraically, fj is still v1 C\n\nCvj.\nThe second answer comes from geometry. The total income is the total area of the\nrectangles. We are emphasizing the correspondencebetween addition and area. That\npoint may seem obvious, but it becomes important when a second investor (smarter\nthan the first) asks a harder question.\nHere is the problem. The incomes as stated are false. The company did not make\na million dollars the first year. After three months, when x was 1=4; the rate of income\nwas only\n?x D 1=2. The bar graph showed\n?\n1 D 1 for the whole year, but that was\nan overstatement. The income in three months was not more than 1=2 times 1=4; the\nrate multiplied by the time.\nAll other quarters and years were also overstated. Figure 5.2a is closer to reality,\nwith 4 years divided into 16 quarters. It gives a new estimate for total income.\nAgain there are two ways to find the total. We add\n?1=4C\n?2=4C\n\nC\n?16=4,\nremembering to multiply them all by 1=4 (because each rate applies to 1=4 year).\nThis is also the area of the 16 rectangles. The area approach is better because the 1=4\nis automatic. Each rectangle has base 1=4; so that factor enters each area. The total\narea is now 5:56 million dollars, closer to the truth.\nYou see what is coming. The next step divides time into weeks. After one week\nthe rate\n?x only\n?1=52. That is the height of the first rectangle--its base is x D\n1=52. There is a rectangle for every week. Then a hard-working investor divides time\ninto days, and the base of each rectangle is x D 1=365. At that point there are\n365 D 1460 rectangles, or 1461 because of leap year, with a total area below 5 1\n\nIntegrals\nFig. 5.2\nIncome D sum of areas (not heights)\nD 1\n\n4 C\n\n4 C\n\nC\n\n!\nmillion dollars. The calculation is elementary but depressing--adding up thousands\nof square roots, each multiplied by x from the base. There has to be a better way.\nThe better way, in fact the best way, is calculus. The whole idea is to allow for\ncontinuous change: The geometry problem is to find the area under the square\nroot curve. That question cannot be answered by arithmetic, because it involves a\nlimit. The rectangles have base x and heights\n?\nx;\n?\n2x; :::;\n?\n4. There are\n4=x rectangles--more and more terms from thinner and thinner rectangles. The\narea is the limit of the sum as x\nN 0.\nThis limiting area is the \"integral.\" We are looking for a number below 5 1\n2.\nAlgebra (area of n rectangles): Compute v1 C\n\nCvn by finding f 's.\nKey idea: If vj D fj\nfj\n1, then the sum is fn\nf0.\nCalculus (area under curve): Compute the limit of xŒv.x/Cv.2x/C\n\n.\nKey idea: If v.x/ D df=dx then area D integral to be explained next.\n5.1\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe problem of summation is to add v1 C\n\nCvn. It is solved\nif we find f 's such that vj D\na\n. Then v1 C\n\nCvn equals\nb\n. The cancellation in .f1\nf0/C.f2\nf1/C\n\nC.fn\n\nfn 1/ leaves only\nc\n. Taking sums is the\nd\nof\ntaking differences.\nThe differences between 0;1;4;9 are v1;v2;v3 D\ne\n. For\nfj D j 2 the difference between f10, and f9 is v10 D\nf\n. From\nthis pattern 1C3C5C\n\nC19 equals\ng\n.\nFor functions, finding the integral is the reverse of\nh\n. If\nthe derivative of f .x/ is v.x/, then the\ni\nof v.x/ is f .x/. If\nv.x/ D 10x then f .x/D\nj\n. This is the\nk\nof a triangle with\nbase x and height 10x.\nIntegrals begin with sums. The triangle under v D 10x out\nto x D 4 has area\nl\n. It is approximated by four rectangles\nof heights 10;20;30;40 and area\nm\n. It is better approximated\nby eight rectangles of heights\nn\nand area\no\n. For n rectan-\ngles covering the triangle the area is the sum of\np\n. As n\nN\n\n5.1\nThe Idea of the Integral\nthis sum should approach the number\nq\n. That is the integral of\nv D 10x from 0 to 4.\nProblems 1-6 are about sums fj and differences vj .\n1 With v D 1;2;4;8, the formula for vj\nis (not 2j ).\nFind f1;f2;f3;f4, starting from f0 D 0. What is f7?\n2 The\nsame\nv D 1;2;4;8; :::\nare\nthe\ndifferences\nbetween\nf D 1;2;4;8;16; :::: Now f0 D 1 and fj D 2j . (a) Check that\n24 equal v5. (b) What is 1C2C4C8C16?\n3 The\ndifferences\nbetween\nf D 1;1=2;1=4;1=8\nare\nv D\n1=2;\n1=4;\n1=8. These negative v's do not add up to these\npositive f 's. Verify that v1 Cv2 Cv3 Cv4 D f4\nf0 is still true.\n4 Any constant C can be added to the antiderivative f .x/\nbecause the\nof a constant is zero. Any C can be added to\nf0;f1; ::: because the\nbetween the f 's is not changed.\n5 Show\nthat\nfj D rj =.r\n1/\nhas\nfj\nfj\n1 D rj\n1.\nTherefore the geometric series 1Cr C\n\nCrj\n1 adds up to\n(remember to subtract f0).\n6 The sums fj D .rj\n1/=.r\n1/ also have fj\nfj\n1 D rj\n1.\nNow f0 D\n. Therefore 1Cr C\n\nCrj\n1 adds up to fj . The\nsum 1Cr C\n\nCrn equals\n.\n7 Suppose v.x/ D 3 for x\n1 and v.x/ D 7 for x\n¡ 1. Find the\narea f .x/ from 0 to x, under the graph of v.x/. (Two pieces.)\n8 If v D 1;\n2;3;\n4; :::, write down the f 's starting from\nf0 D 0. Find formulas for vj and fj when j is odd and j is even.\nProblems 9-16 are about the company earning\n?x per year.\n9 When time is divided into weeks there are 4\n52 D 208\nrectangles. Write down the first area, the 208th area, and the\njth area.\n10 How do you know that the sum over 208 weeks is smaller\nthan the sum over 16 quarters?\n11 A pessimist would use\n?x at the beginning of each time\nperiod as the income rate for that period. Redraw Figure 5.1\n(both parts) using heights\n?\n0;\n?\n1;\n?\n2;\n?\n3. How much lower\nis the estimate of total income?\n12 The same pessimist would redraw Figure 5.2 with heights\n0;\na\n1=4; :::: What is the height of the last rectangle? How\nmuch does this change reduce the total rectangular area 5:56?\n13 At every step from years to weeks to days to hours, the\npessimist's area goes\nand the optimist's area goes\n.\nThe difference between them is the area of the last\n.\n14 The optimist and pessimist arrive at the same limit as years\nare divided into weeks, days, hours, seconds. Draw the\n?x curve\nbetween the rectangles to show why the pessimist is always too low\nand the optimist is too high.\n15 (Important) Let f .x/ be the area under the\n?x curve, above the\ninterval from 0 to x. The area to x Cx is f .x Cx/. The extra\narea is f D\n. This is almost a rectangle with base\nand height\n?x. So f =x is close to\n. As x\nN 0 we sus-\npect that df =dx D\n.\n16 Draw the\n?x curve from x D 0 to 4 and put triangles below to\nprove that the area under it is more than 5: Look left and right from\nthe point where\n?\n1 D 1.\nProblems 17-22 are about a company whose expense rate v.x/ D\nx is decreasing.\n17 The expenses drop to zero at x D\n. The total expense dur-\ning those years equals\n. This is the area of\n.\n18 The rectangles of heights 6;5;4;3;2;1 give a total estimated ex-\npense of\n. Draw them enclosing the triangle to show why this\ntotal is too high.\n19 How many rectangles (enclosing the triangle) would you need\nbefore their areas are within 1 of the correct triangular area?\n20 The accountant uses 2-year intervals and computes v D 5;3;1 at\nthe midpoints (the odd-numbered years). What is her estimate, how\naccurate is it, and why?\n21 What is the area f .x/ under the line v.x/ D 6\nx above the in-\nterval from 2 to x? What is the derivative of this f .x/?\n22 What is the area f .x/ under the line v.x/ D 6\nx above the in-\nterval from x to 6? What is the derivative of this f .x/?\n23 With x D 1=3, find the area of the three rectangles that\nenclose the graph of v.x/D x2.\n24 Draw graphs of v D\n?x and v D x2 from 0 to 1: Which areas\nadd to 1? The same is true for v D x3 and v D\n.\n25 From x to x Cx, the area under v D x2 is f . This is almost\na rectangle with base x and height\n. So f =x is close to\n. In the limit we find df =dx D x2 and f .x/ D\n.\n26 Compute the area of 208 rectangles under v.x/D\n?x from\nx D 0 to x D 4.\n\nIntegrals\n5.2 Antiderivatives\nThe symbol\nr\nwas invented by Leibniz to represent the integral. It is a stretched-out\nS, from the Latin word for sum. This symbol is a powerful reminder of the whole\nconstruction: Sum approaches integral, S approaches\nr\n, and rectangular area\napproaches curved area:\ncurved area D\nr\nv.x/ dx D\nr\n?\nx dx:\n(1)\nThe rectangles of base x lead to this limit--the integral of\n?x. The \"dx\" indicates\nthat x approaches zero. The heights vj of the rectangles are the heights v.x/ of\nthe curve. The sum of vj times x approaches \"the integral of v of x dx.\" You can\nimagine an infinitely thin rectangle above every point, instead of ordinary rectangles\nabove special points.\nWe now find the area under the square root curve. The \"limits of integration\" are\n0 and 4. The lower limit is x D 0, where the area begins. (The start could be any\npoint x D a.) The upper limit is x D 4, since we stop after four years. (The finish\ncould be any point x D b.) The area of the rectangles is a sum of base x times\nheights\n?x. The curved area is the limit of this sum. That limit is the integral of\n?x from 0 to 4:\nlim\nx\nN0\nh\n.\n?\nx/.x/C.\n?\n2x/.x/C\n\nC.\n?\n4/.x/\ni\nD\n» xD4\nxD0\n?\nx dx:\n(2)\nThe outstanding problem of integral calculus is still to be solved. What is this limiting\narea? We have a symbol for the answer, involving\nr\nand\n?x and dx--but we don't\nhave a number.\nTHE ANTIDERIVATIVE\nI wish I knew who discovered the area under the graph of\n?x. It may have been\nNewton. The answer was available earlier, but the key idea was shared by Newton\nand Leibniz. They understood the parallels between sums and integrals, and between\ndifferences and derivatives. I can give the answer, by following that analogy. I can't\ngive the proof (yet)--it is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\nIn algebra the difference fj\nfj\n1 is vj . When we add, the sum of the v's is\nfn\nf0. In calculus the derivative of f .x/ is v.x/. When we integrate, the area\nunder the v.x/ curve is f .x/ minus f .0/. Our problem asks for the area out to x D\n4:\n5B (Discrete vs. continuous, rectangles vs. curved areas, addition vs. integration)\nThe integral of v.x/ is the difference in f .x/:\nIf df=dx D\n?\nx then area D\nr xD4\nxD0\n?\nx dx D f .4/\nf .0/:\n(3)\nWhat is f .x/? Instead of the derivative of\n?x, we need its \"antiderivative.\" We\nhave to find a function f .x/ whose derivative is\n?x. It is the opposite of Chapters\n4; and requires us to work backwards. The derivative of xn is nxn 1--now\nwe need the antiderivative. The quick formula is f .x/ D xnC1=.nC1/--we aim to\nunderstand it.\nSolution\nSince the derivative lowers the exponent, the antiderivative raises it. We\ngo from x1=2 to x3=2. But then the derivative is .3=2/x1=2. It contains an unwanted\nfactor 3=2. To cancel that factor, put 2=3 into the antiderivative:\n\n5.2\nAntiderivatives\nf .x/ D 2\n3x3=2 has the required derivative v.x/ D x1=2 D\n?\nx:\nFig. 5.3\nThe integral of v.x/D\n?x is the exact area 16=3 under the curve.\nThere you see the key to integrals: Work backward from derivatives (and adjust).\nNow comes a number--the exact area. At x D 4 we find x3=2 D 8. Multiply by 2=3\nto get 16=3. Then subtract f .0/ D 0:\n» xD4\nxD0\n?\nx dx D 2\n3.4/3=2\n3.0/3=2 D 2\n3.8/ D 16\n(4)\nThe total income over four years is 16=3 D 5 1\n3 million dollars. This is f .4/\n\nf .0/. The sum from thousands of rectangles was slowly approaching this exact area\n5 1\n3.\nOther areas The income in the first year, at x D 1, is 2\n3.1/3=2 D 2\n3 million dollars.\n(The false income was 1 million dollars.) The total income after x years is 2\n3.x/3=2,\nwhich is the antiderivative f .x/. The square root curve covers 2=3 of the overall\nrectangle it sits in. The rectangle goes out to x and up to\n?x, with area x3=2, and\n2=3 of that rectangle is below the curve. (1=3 is above.)\nOther antiderivatives The derivative of x5 is 5x4. Therefore the antiderivative of\nx4 is x5=5. Divide by 5 (or nC1) to cancel the 5 (or nC1) from the derivative. And\ndon't allow nC1 D 0:\nThe derivative v.x/ D xn has the antiderivative f .x/ D xnC1=.nC1/:\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe antiderivative of x2 is 1\n3x3. This is the area under the parabola\nv.x/ D x2. The area out to x D 1 is 1\n3.1/3\n3.0/3, or 1=3.\nRemark on\n?x and x2\nThe 2=3 from\n?x and the 1=3 from x2 add to 1. Those are\nthe areas below and above the\n?x curve, in the corner of Figure 5.3. If you turn\nthe curve by 90\n, it becomes the parabola. The functions y D\n?x and x D y2 are\ninverses! The areas for these inverse functions add to a square of area 1.\n\nIntegrals\nAREA UNDER A STRAIGHT LINE\nYou already know the area of a triangle. The region is below the diagonal line v D x\nin Figure 5.4. The base is 4, the height is 4, and the area is 1\n2.4/.4/ D 8. Integration\nis\nFig. 5.4\nTriangular area 8 as the limit of rectangular areas 10;9;8 1\n2; ::::\nnot required! But if you allow calculus to repeat that answer, and build up the integral\nf .x/ D 1\n2x2 as the limiting area of many rectangles, you will have the beginning of\nsomething important.\nThe four rectangles have area 1C2C3C4 D 10. That is greater than 8, because\nthe triangle is inside. 10 is a first approximation to the triangular area 8, and to\nimprove it we need more rectangles.\nThe next rectangles will be thinner, of width x D 1=2 instead of the original\nx D 1. There will be eight rectangles instead of four. They extend above the line, so\nthe answer is still too high. The new heights are 1=2, 1, 3=2, 2, 5=2, 3, 7=2, 4. The\ntotal area in Figure 5.4b is the sum of the base x D 1=2 times those heights:\narea D 1\n2 C1C 3\n2 C2C\n\nC4\n\nD 9 (which is closer to 8):\nQuestion What is the area of 16 rectangles? Their heights are 1\n4; 1\n2; :::;4.\nAnswer\nWith base x D 1\n4 the area is 1\n4 C 1\n2 C\n\nC4\n\nD 8 1\n2.\nThe effort of doing the addition is increasing. A formula for the sums is needed, and\nwill be established soon. (The next answer would be 8 1\n4.) But more important than\nthe formula is the idea. We are carrying out a Iimiting process, one step at a time.\nThe area of the rectangles is approaching the area of the triangle, as x decreases.\nThe same limiting process will apply to other areas, in which the region is much more\ncomplicated. Therefore we pause to comment on what is important.\nArea Under a Curve\nWhat requirements are imposed on those thinner and thinner rectangles? It is not\nessential that they all have the same width. And it is not required that they cover the\ntriangle completely. The rectangles could lie below the curve. The limiting answer\nwill still be 8, even if the widths x are unequal and the rectangles fit inside the\ntriangle or across it. We only impose two rules:\n1. The largest width xmax must approach zero.\n2. The top of each rectangle must touch or cross the curve.\n\n5.2\nAntiderivatives\nThe area under the graph is defined to be the limit of these rectangular areas, if that\nlimit exists. For the straight line, the limit does exist and equals 8. That limit is\nindependent of the particular widths and heights--as we absolutely insist it should be.\nSection 5.5 allows any continuous v.x/. The question will be the same--Does the\nlimit exist? The answer will be the same--Yes. That limit will be the integral of\nv.x/, and it will be the area under the curve. It will be f .x/.\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe triangular area from 0 to x is 1\n2.base/.height/ D 1\n2.x/.x/. That\nis f .x/ D 1\n2x2. Its derivative is v.x/ D x. But notice that 1\n2x2 C1 has the same\nderivative. So does f D 1\n2x2 CC , for any constant C . There is a \"constant of\nintegration\" in f .x/, which is wiped out in its derivative v.x/.\nEXAMPLE 3\nSuppose the velocity is decreasing: v.x/ D 4\nx. If we sample v at\nx D 1;2;3;4; the rectangles lie under the graph. Because v is decreasing, the right\nend of each interval gives vmin. Then the rectangular area 3C2C1C0 D 6 is less\nthan the exact area 8. The rectangles are inside the triangle, and eight rectangles with\nbase 1\n2 come closer:\nrectangular area D 1\n2.3 1\n2 C3C\n\nC 1\n2 C0/ D 7:\nSixteen rectangles would have area 7 1\n2. We repeat that the rectangles need not have\nthe same widths x, but it makes these calculations easier.\nWhat is the area out to an arbitrary point (like x D 3 or x D 1)? We could insert\nrectangles, but the Fundamental Theorem offers a faster way. Any antiderivative\nof 4\nx will give the area. We look for a function whose derivative is 4\nx. The\nderivative of 4x is 4, the derivative of 1\n2x2 is x, so work backward:\nto achieve df=dx D 4\nx choose f .x/ D 4x\n2x2:\nCalculus skips past the rectangles and computes f .3/ D 7 1\n2. The area between x D\n1 and x D 3 is the difference 7 1\n3 1\n2 D 4. In Figure 5.5, this is the area of the\ntrapezoid.\nThe f-curve flattens out when the v-curve touches zero. No new area is being\nadded.\nFig. 5.5\nThe area is f D 7 1\n3 1\n2 D 4. Since v.x/ decreases, f .x/ bends down.\n\nIntegrals\nINDEFINITE INTEGRALS AND DEFINITE INTEGRALS\nWe have to distinguish two different kinds of integrals. They both use the antideriva-\ntive f .x/. The definite one involves the limits 0 and 4, the indefinite one doesn't:\nThe indefinite integral is a function f .x/ D 4x\n2x2.\nThe definite integral from x D 0 to x D 4 is the number f .4/\nf .0/.\nThe definite integral is definitely 8. But the indefinite integral is not necessarily\n4x\n2x2. We can change f .x/ by a constant without changing its derivative\n(since the derivative of a constant is zero). The following functions are also antideriva-\ntives:\nf .x/ D 4x\n2x2 C1;\nf .x/ D 4x\n2x2\n9;\nf .x/ D 4x\n2x2 CC:\nThe first two are particular examples. The last is the general case. The constant C\ncan be anything (including zero), to give all functions with the required derivative.\nThe theory of calculus will show that there are no others. The indefinite integral is\nthe most general antiderivative (with no limits):\nindefinite integral f .x/ D r\nv.x/ dx D 4x\n2x2 CC:\n(5)\nBy contrast, the definite integral is a number. It contains no arbitrary constant C .\nMore that that, it contains no variable x. The definite integral is determined by the\nfunction v.x/ and the limits of integration (also known as the endpoints). It is the\narea under the graph between those endpoints.\nTo see the relation of indefinite to definite, answer this question: What is the defi-\nnite integral between x D 1 and x D 3? The indefinite integral gives f .3/ D 7 1\n2 CC\nand f .1/ D 3 1\n2 CC . To find the area between the limits, subtract f at one limit\nfrom f at the other limit:\nr 3\nxD1 v.x/ dx D f .3/\nf .1/ D .7 1\n2 CC/\n.3 1\n2 CC/ D 4:\n(6)\nThe constant cancels itself! The definite integral is the difference between the values\nof the indefinite integral. C disappears in the subtraction.\nThe difference f .3/\nf .1/ is like fn\nf0. The sum of vj from 1 to n has become\n\"the integral of v.x/ from 1 to 3.\" Section 5.3 computes other areas from sums, and\n5:4 computes many more from antiderivatives. Then we come back to the definite\nintegral and the Fundamental Theorem:\n» b\na\nv.x/ dx D\n» b\na\ndf\ndx dx D f .b/\nf .a/:\n(7)\n5.2\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nIntegration yields the\na\nunder a curve y D v.x/.

We find explicit formulas for\nfn D v1 C\n\nCvn: From areas of rectangles, the limits produce the area f .x/\nunder a curve. According to the Fundamental Theorem, df=dx should return\nus to v.x/--and we verify in each case that it does.\nMay I recall that there is sometimes an easier way? If we can find an f .x/ whose\nderivative is v.x/, then the integral of v is f: Sums and limits are not required, when\nf is spotted directly. The next section, which explains how to look for f .x/, will\ndisplace this one. (If we can't find an antiderivative we fall back on summation.)\nGiven a successful f; adding any constant produces another f --since the derivative\nof the constant is zero. The right constant achieves f .0/ D 0, with no extra effort.\nThis section constructs f .x/ from sums. The next section searches for antiderivatives.\nTHE SIGMA NOTATION\nIn a section about sums, there has to be a decent way to express them. Consider\n12 C22 C32C42: The individual terms are vj D j 2: Their sum can be written in\nsummation notation, using the capital Greek letter + (pronounced sigma):\n12 C22 C32C42 is written\nX\nj D1\nj 2:\nSpoken aloud, that becomes \"the sum of j 2 from j D 1 to 4.\" It equals 30: The\nlimits on j (written below and above +) indicate where to start and stop:\nv1 C\n\nCvn D\nn\nX\nj D1\nvj\nand\nv3 C\n\nCv9 D\nX\nkD3\nvk:\n(1)\nThe k at the end of (1) makes an additional point. There is nothing special about the\nletter j: That is a \"dummy variable,\" no better and no worse than k (or i). Dummy\nvariables are only on one side (the side with +), and they have no effect on the sum.\nThe upper limit n is on both sides. Here are six sums:\nnP\nkD1\nk D 1C2C3C\n\nCn\n4P\nj D1\n. 1/j D\n1C1\n1C1 D 0\n5P\nj D1\n.2j\n1/ D 1C3C5C7C9 D 52\n0P\niD0\nvi D v0\nh\nonly one term\ni\n4P\niD1\nj 2 D\nh\nmeaningless?\ni\nP\nkD0\n2k D 1C 1\n2 C 1\n4 C\n\nD 2\nh\ninfinite series\ni\nThe numbers 1 and n or 1 and 4 (or 0 and\n8) are the lower limit and upper\nlimit. The dummy variable i or j or k is the index of summation. I hope it seems\nreasonable that the infinite series 1C 1\n2 C 1\n4 C\n\nadds to 2: We will come back to it\nin Chapter 10.\nA sum like +n\nj D16 looks meaningless, but it is actually 6C6C\n\nC6 D 6n: It\nfollows the rules. In fact +4\niD1j 2 is not meaningless either. Every term is j 2 and by\nZeno the Greek believed it was impossible to get anywhere, since he would only go halfway\nand then half again and half again. Infinite series would have changed his whole life.\n\n5.3\nSummation versus Integration\nthe same rules, that sum is 4j 2: However the i was probably intended to be j: Then\nthe sum is 1C4C9C16 D 30:\nQuestion What happens to these sums when the upper limits are changed to n?\nAnswer\nThe sum depends on the stopping point n. A formula is required (when\npossible). Integrals stop at x, sums stop at n, and we now look for special cases when\nf .x/ or fn can be found.\nA SPECIAL SUMMATION FORMULA\nHow do you add the first 100 whole numbers? The problem is to compute\nX\nj D1\nj D 1C2C3C\n\nC98C99C100 D‹\nIf you were Gauss, you would see the answer at once. (He solved this problem at a\nridiculous age, which gave his friends the idea of getting him into another class.)\nHis solution was to combine 1C100, and 2C99, and 3C98, always adding to 101.\nThere are fifty of those combinations. Thus the sum is .50/.101/ D 5050.\nThe sum from 1 to n uses the same idea. The first and last terms add to nC1: The\nnext terms n\n1 and 2 also add to nC1: If n is even (as 100 was) then there are 1\n2n\nparts. Therefore the sum is 1\n2n times nC1:\nn\nX\nj D1\nj D 1C2C\n\nC.n\n1/Cn D 1\n2n.nC1/:\n(2)\nThe important term is 1\n2n2, but the exact sum is 1\n2n2 C 1\n2n:\nWhat happens if n is an odd number (like n D 99)? Formula (2) remains true. The\ncombinations 1C99 and 2C98 still add to nC1 D 100: There are 1\n2.99/ D 49 1\nsuch pairs, because the middle term (which is 50) has nothing to combine with. Thus\n1C2C\n\nC99 equals 49 1\n2 times 100, or 4950.\nRemark\nThat sum had to be 4950; because it is 5050 minus 100: The sum up to 99\nequals the sum up to 100 with the last term removed. Our key formula fn\nfn 1 D\nvn has turned up again!\nEXAMPLE Find the sum 101C102C\n\nC200 of the second hundred numbers.\nFirst solution This is the sum from 1 to 200 minus the sum from 1 to 100 W\nX\nj D\nX\nj\n\nX\nj:\n(3)\nThe middle sum is 1\n2.200/.201/ and the last is 1\n2.100/.101/: Their difference is\n15050:\nNote! I left out \"j D\" in the limits. It is there, but not written.\nSecond solution The answer 15050 is exactly the sum of the first hundred numbers\n(which was 5050) plus an additional 10000: Believing that a number like 10000 can\nnever turn up by accident, we look for a reason. It is found through changing the\nlimits of summation:\n\nIntegrals\nX\nj D101\nj is the same sum as\nX\nkD1\n.k C100/:\n(4)\nThis is important, to be able to shift limits around. Often the lower limit is moved\nto zero or one, for convenience. Both sums have 100 terms (that doesn't change).\nThe dummy variable j is replaced by another dummy variable k: They are related by\nj D k C100 or equivalently by k D j\n100:\nThe variable must change everywhere--in the lower limit and the upper limit\nas well as inside the sum. If j starts at 101; then k D j\n100 starts at 1: If j ends\nat 200; k ends at 100: If j appears in the sum, it is replaced by k C100 (and if j 2\nappeared it would become .k C100/2/:\nFrom equation (4) you see why the answer is 15050: The sum 1C2C\n\nC100 is\n5050 as before. 100 is added to each of those 100 terms. That gives 10000:\nEXAMPLES OF CHANGING THE VARIABLE (and the limits)\n3P\niD0\n2i equals\n4P\nj D1\n2j\n(here i D j\n1). Both sums are 1C2C4C8\nnP\niD3\nvi equals\nn 3\nP\nj D0\nvj C3\n(here i D j C3 and j D i\n3). Both sums are v3 C\n\nCvn:\nWhy change n to n\n3? Because the upper limit is i D n: So j C3 D n and j D\nn\n3:\nA final step is possible, and you will often see it. The new variable j can be\nchanged back to i: Dummy variables have no meaning of their own, but at first the\nresult looks surprising:\nX\niD0\n2i equals\nX\nj D1\n2j\n1 equals\nX\niD1\n2i\n1:\nWith practice you might do that in one step, skipping the temporary letter j: Every i\non the left becomes i\n1 on the right. Then i D 0; :::;5 changes to i D 1; :::;6: (At\nfirst two steps are safer.) This may seem a minor point, but soon we will be changing\nthe limits on integrals instead of sums. Integration is parallel to summation, and it is\nbetter to see a \"change of variable\" here first.\nNote about 1C2C\n\nCn: The good thing is that Gauss found the sum 1\n2n.nC1/:\nThe bad thing is that his method looked too much like a trick. I would like to show\nhow this fits the fundamental rule connecting sums and differences:\nif v1 Cv2 C\n\nCvn D fn then vn D fn\nfn 1:\n(5)\nGauss says that fn is 1\n2n.nC1/: Reducing n by 1, his formula for fn 1 is 1\n2.n\n1/n:\nThe difference fn\nfn 1 should be the last term n in the sum:\nfn\nfn 1 D 1\n2n.nC1/\n2.n\n1/n D 1\n2.n2 Cn\nn2Cn/ D n:\n(6)\nThis is the one term vn D n that is included in fn but not in fn 1:\nThere is a deeper point here. For any sum fn; there are two things to check. The\nf 's must begin correctly and they must change correctly. The underlying idea is\nmathematical induction: Assume the statement is true below n: Prove it for n.\n\n5.3\nSummation versus Integration\nGoal: To prove that 1C2C\n\nCn D 1\n2n.nC1/: This is the guess fn.\nProof by induction: Check f1 (it equals 1). Check fn\nfn 1(it equals n).\nFor n D 1 the answer 1\n2n.nC1/ D 1\n2 is correct. For n D 2 this formula 1\nagrees with 1C2: But that separate test is not necessary! If f1 is right, and if the\nchange fn\nfn 1 is right for every n; then fn must be right. Equation (6) was\nthe key test, to show that the change in f 's agrees with v:\nThat is the logic behind mathematical induction, but I am not happy with most of\nthe exercises that use it. There is absolutely no excitement. The answer is given by\nsome higher power (like Gauss), and it is proved correct by some lower power (like\nus). It is much better when we lower powers find the answer for ourselves. Therefore\nI will try to do that for the second problem, which is the sum of squares.\nTHE SUM OF j 2 AND THE INTEGRAL OF x2\nAn important calculation comes next. It is the area in Figure 5.6. One region is made\nup of rectangles, so its area is a sum of n pieces. The other region lies under the\nparabola v D x2: It cannot be divided into rectangles, and calculus is needed.\nThe first problem is to find fn D 12C22 C32 C\n\nCn2: This is a sum of squares,\nwith f1 D 1 and f2 D 5 and f3 D 14: The goal is to find the pattern in that sequence.\nBy trying to guess fn we are copying what will soon be done for integrals.\nCalculus looks for an f .x/ whose derivative is v.x/: There f is an antiderivative\nFig. 5.6\nRectangles enclosing v D x2 have area\n\n3n3 C 1\n2n2 C 1\n6n\n\n.x/3\n3.nx/3 D 1\n3x3:\n(or an integral). Algebra looks for fn's whose differences produce vn: Here fn could\nbe called an antidifference (better to call it a sum).\nThe best start is a good guess. Copying directly from integrals, we might try\nfn D 1\n3n3: To test if it is right, check whether fn\nfn 1 produces on vn D n2:\n3n3\n3.n\n1/3 D 1\n3n3\n3.n3\n3n2C3n\n1/ D n2\nnC 1\n3:\nWe see n2, but also\nnC 1\n3: The guess 1\n3n3 needs correction terms. To cancel 1\nin the difference, I subtract 1\n3n from the sum. To put back n in the difference, I add\n1C2C\n\nCn D 1\n2n.nC1/ to the sum. The new guess (which should be right) is\nfn D 1\n3n3 C 1\n2n.nC1/\n3n D 1\n3n3 C 1\n2n2 C 1\n6n:\n(7)\nTo check this answer, verify first that f1 D 1: Also f2 D 5 and f3 D 14: To be\ncertain, verify that fn\nfn 1 D n2: For calculus the important term is 1\n3n3:\nThe goal of real teaching is for the student to find the answer. And also the problem.\n\nIntegrals\nThe sum\nnP\nj D1\nj 2 of the first n squares is 1\n3n3 plus corrections 1\n2n2 and 1\n6n:\nIn practice\n3n3 is an excellent estimate. The sum of the first 100 squares is\napproximately\n3.100/3, or a third of a million. If we need the exact answer,\nequation (7) is available: the sum is 338;350: Many applications (example: the\nnumber of steps to solve 100 linear equations) can settle for 1\n3n3:\nWhat is fascinating is the contrast with calculus. Calculus has no correction terms!\nThey get washed away in the limit of thin rectangles. When the sum is replaced by\nthe integral (the area), we get an absolutely clean answer:\nThe integral of v D x2 from x D 0 to x D n is exactly 1\n3n3.\nThe area under the parabola, out to the point x D 100, is precisely a third of a million.\nWe have to explain why, with many rectangles.\nThe idea is to approach an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles. A hundred\nrectangles gave an area of 338;350: Now take a thousand rectangles.

The leading term is a third of a million,\nas predicted. The other terms are approaching zero! They contain x, and as the\nrectangles get thinner they disappear. They only account for the small corners of\nrectangles that lie above the curve. The vanishing of those corners will eventually be\nproved for any continuous functions--the area from the correction terms goes to\nzero--but here in equation (9) you see it explicitly.\nThe area under the curve came from the central idea of integration: 100=x\nrectangles of width x approach the limiting areaD 1\n3.100/3: The rectangular area\nis +vj x: The exact area is\nr\nv.x/dx: In the limit + becomes\nr\nand vj be-\ncomes v.x/ and x becomes dx:\n\n5.3\nSummation versus Integration\nThat completes the calculation for a parabola. It used the formula for a sum of\nsquares, which was special. But the underlying idea is much more general. The\nlimit of the sums agrees with the antiderivative: The antiderivative of v.x/ D x2 is\nf .x/ D 1\n3x3. According to the Fundamental Theorem, the area under v.x/ is f .x/:\nr 100\nv.x/ dx D f .100/\nf .0/ D 1\n3.100/3:\nThat Fundamental Theorem is not yet proved! I mean it is not proved by us. Whether\nLeibniz or Newton managed to prove it, I am not quite sure. But it can be done. Start-\ning from sums of differences, the difficulty is that we have too many limits at once.\nThe sums of vj x are approaching the integral. The differences f=x approach\nthe derivative. A real proof has to separate those steps, and Section 5.7 will do it.\nProved or not, you are seeing the main point. What was true for the numbers fj\nand vj is true in the limit for v.x/ and f .x/: Now v.x/ can vary continuously, but it\nis still the slope of f .x/: The reverse of slope is area.\n.1C2C3C4/2 D 13 C23 C33 C43\nProof without words by Roger Nelsen (Mathematics Magazine 1990).\nFinally we review the area under v D x: The sum of 1C2C\n\nCn is 1\n2n2 C 1\n2n:\nThis gives the area of n D 4=x rectangles, going out to x D 4: The heights are\njx, the bases are x, and we add areas:\n4=x\nX\nj D1\n.jx/.x/ D .x/2\n\"\nx\nC 1\nx\n#\nD 8C2x:\n(10)\nWith x D 1 the area is 1C2C3C4 D 10: With eight rectangles and x D 1\n2, the\narea was 8C2x D 9: Sixteen rectangles of width 1\n4 brought the correction 2x\ndown to 1\n2: The exact area is 8: The error is proportional to x.\nImportant note There you see a question in applied mathematics. If there is an\nerror, what size is it? How does it behave as x\nN 0? The x term disappears in\nthe limit, and .x/2 disappears faster. But to get an error of 10\n6 we need eight\nmillion rectangles:\n2x D 2\n4=8;000;000 D 10\n6:\nThat is horrifying! The numbers 10;9;8 1\n2;8 1\n4; ::: seem to approach the area 8 in\na satisfactory way, but the convergence is much too slow. It takes twice as much\nwork to get one more binary digit in the answer--which is absolutely unacceptable.\nSomehow the x term must be removed. If the correction is .x/2 instead of x,\nthen a thousand rectangles will reach an accuracy of 10\n6:\nThe problem is that the rectangles are unbalanced. Their right sides touch the\ngraph of v, but their left sides are much too high. The best is to cross the graph in\nthe middle of the interval--this is the midpoint rule. Then the rectangle sits halfway\nacross the line v D x, and the error is zero. Section 5.8 comes back to this rule--and\nto Simpson's rule that fits parabolas and removes the .x/2 term and is built into\nmany calculators.\n\nIntegrals\nFinally we try the quick way. The area under v D x is f D 1\n2x2, because df=dx\nis v: The area out to x D 4 is 1\n2.4/2 D 8: Done.\nFig. 5.7\nEndpoint rules: error\n1=(work)\n1=n: Midpoint rule is better: error\n1=.work/2:\nOptional: pth powers\nOur sums are following a pattern. First, 1C\n\nCn is 1\n2n2\nplus 1\n2n: The sum of squares is 1\n3n3 plus correction terms. The sum of pth powers\nis\n1p C2p C\n\nCnp D\npC1npC1 plus correction terms:\n(11)\n192 The correction involves lower powers of n, and you know what is coming.

We only need pC1\n¡ 0 to be sure npC1 is genuinely the\nleading term. The antiderivative of v D xp is f D xpC1=.pC1/.\nWe are close to interesting experiments. The correction terms disappear and the sum\napproaches the integral. Here are actual numbers for p D 1, when the sum and integral\nare easy: Sn D 1C\n\nCn and In D r\nx dx D 1\n2n2: The difference is Dn D 1\n2n: The\nthing to watch is the relative error En D Dn=In:\nn\nSn\nIn\nDn D Sn\nIn\nEn D Dn=In\n:010\n:005\nThe number 20;100 is 1\n2.200/.201/: Please write down the next line n D 400, and\nplease find a formula for En. You can guess En from the table, or you can derive\nit from knowing Sn and In: The formula should show that En goes to zero. More\nimportant, it should show how quick (or slow) that convergence will be.\nOne more number--a third of a million--was mentioned earlier.

The errors En;p are sure to obey a systematic\nrule--they are proportional to 1=n and to an unknown number C.p/ that depends on\np: I hope you can push the experiments far enough to discover C.p/: This is not an\nexercise with an answer in the back of the book--it is mathematics.\n5.3\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe Greek letter\na\nindicates summation.

We leave aside\nsums of rectangular areas, and their limits as x\nN 0: Instead we search for an f .x/\nwith the required derivative v.x/: In practice, this approach is more or less\nindependent of the approach through sums--but it gives the same answer. And also,\nthe search for an antiderivative may not succeed. We may not find f: In that case\nwe go back to rectangles, or on to something better in Section 5.8.\nA computer is ready to integrate v, but not by discovering f: It integrates\nbetween specified limits, to obtain a number (the definite integral). Here we hope\nto find a function (the indefinite integral). That requires a symbolic integration code\nlike MACSYMA or Mathematica or MAPLE, or a reasonably nice v.x/, or both.\nAn expression for f .x/ can have tremendous advantages over a list of numbers.\nThus our goal is to find antiderivatives and use them. The techniques will be further\ndeveloped in Chapter 7--this section is short but good. First we write down what\nwe know. On each line, f .x/ is an antiderivative of v.x/ because df=dx D v.x/.\nKnown pairs\nFunction v.x/\nAntiderivative f .x/\nPowers of x\nxn\nxnC1=.nC1/CC\nn D\n1 is not included, because nC1 would be zero. v D x\n1 will lead us\nto f D ln x:\nTrigonometric functions\ncos x\nsin x CC\nsin x\ncos x CC\nsec2x\ntan x CC\ncsc2x\ncot x CC\nsec x tan x\nsec x CC\ncsc x cot x\ncsc x CC\nInverse functions\n1=\n?\nx2\nsin\n1x CC\n1=.1Cx2/\ntan\n1x CC\n1= |x\n|\n?\nx2\nsec\n1x CC\nYou recognize that each integration formula came directly from a differentiation\nformula. The integral of the cosine is the sine, because the derivative of the sine is\nthe cosine.

One is to find the derivative of a new\nf .x/: Then f goes in one column and v D df=dx goes in the other co1umn. The\nother possibility is to use rules for derivatives to find rules for integrals. That is the\nway to extend the list, enormously and easily.\nWe will soon meet ex, which goes in both columns. It is f .x/ and also v.x/:\n\nIntegrals\nRULES FOR INTEGRALS\nAmong the rules for derivatives, three were of supreme importance. They were\nlinearity, the product rule, and the chain rule. Everything flowed from those three.\nIn the reverse direction (from v to f ) this is still true. The three basic methods of\ndifferential calculus also dominate integral calculus:\nlinearity of derivatives\nN linearity of integrals\nproduct rule for derivatives\nN integration by parts\nchain rule for derivatives\nN integrals by substitution\nThe easiest is linearity, which comes first. Integration by parts will be left for\nSection 7.1. This section starts on substitutions, reversing the chain rule to make an\nintegral simpler.\nLINEARITY OF INTEGRALS\nWhat is the integral of v.x/Cw.x/? Add the two separate integrals. The graph of\nvCw has two regions below it, the area under v and the area from v to vCw:\nAdding areas gives the sum rule. Suppose f and g are antiderivatives of v and w:\nsum rule:\nf Cg\nis an antiderivative of\nvCw\nconstant rule:\ncf\nis an antiderivative of\ncv\nlinearity:\naf Cbg\nis an antiderivative of\navCbw\nThis is a case of overkill. The first two rules are special cases of the third, so logically\nthe last rule is enough. However it is so important to deal quickly with constants-- just\n\"factor them out\"--that the rule cv\nØ cf is stated separately. The proofs come from\nthe linearity of derivatives: .af Cbg/\n1 equals af\n1 Cbg\n1 which equals avCbw.\nThe rules can be restated with integral signs:\nsum rule:\nr\nv.x/Cw.x/\n\ndx D r\nv.x/ dx Cr\nw.x/ dx\nconstant rule:\nr\ncv.x/ dx D c\nr\nv.x/ dx\nlinearity:\nr\nav.x/Cbw.x/\n\ndx D ar\nv.x/ dx Cb r\nw.x/ dx\nNote about the constant in f .x/CC . All antiderivatives allow the addition of a\nconstant.\nFor\na\ncombination\nlike\nav.x/Cbw.x/,\nthe\nantiderivative\nis\naf .x/Cbg.x/CC: The constants for each part combine into a single constant.\nTo give all possible antiderivatives of a function, just remember to write \"CC \" after\none of them. The real problem is to find that one antiderivative.\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe antiderivative of v D x2 Cx\n2 is f D x3=3C.x\n1/=. 1/CC:\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe antiderivative of 6 cos t C7 sin t is 6 sin t\n7 cos t CC:\nEXAMPLE 3\nRewrite\nsin x as 1\nsin x\nsin2x D 1\nsin x\ncos2x\nD sec2x\nsec x tan x:\nThe antiderivative is tan x\nsec x CC: That rewriting is done by a symbolic algebra\ncode (or by you).

To see the\nidea, you have to remember the chain rule:\nf .g.x//\nhas derivative\nf\n1.g.x//.dg=dx/\nsin x2\nhas derivative\n.cos x2/.2x/\n.x3 C1/5\nhas derivative\n5.x3 C1/4.3x2/\nIf the function on the right is given, the function on the left is its antiderivative!\nThere are two points to emphasize right away:\n1. Constants are no problem--they can always be fixed. Divide by 2 or 15:\n»\nx cos.x/2dx D 1\n2 sin.x2/CC\n»\nx2.x3 C1/4dx D 1\n15.x3 C1/5CC\nNotice the 2 from x2, the 5 from the fifth power, and the 3 from x3:\n2. Choosing the inside function g (or u) commits us to its derivative:\nthe integral of 2x cos x2 is sin x2 CC\n.g D x2;dg=dx D 2x/\nthe integral of cos x2 is (failure)\n.no dg=dx/\nthe integral of x2 cos x2 is (failure)\n.wrong dg=dx/\nTo substitute g for x2, we need its derivative. The trick is to spot an inside function\nwhose derivative is present. We can fix constants like 2 or 15; but otherwise dg=dx\nhas to be there. Very often the inside function g is written u. We use that letter to\nstate the substitution rule, when f is the integral of v:\n»\nv.u.x//du\ndx dx D f .u.x//CC:\n(1)\nEXAMPLE 4\nr\nsin x cos x dx D 1\n2.sin x/2 CC\nu D sin x (compare Example 6)\nEXAMPLE 5\nr\nsin2x cos x dx D 1\n3.sin x/3 CC\nu D sin x\nEXAMPLE 6\nr\ncos x sin x dx D\n2.cos x/2 CC\nu D cos x (compare Example 4)\nEXAMPLE 7\nr\ntan4x sec2x dx D 1\n5.tan x/5 CC\nu D tan x\nThe next example has u D x2\n1 and du=dx D 2x: The key step is choosing u:\nEXAMPLE 8\nr\nx dx=\n?\nx2\n1 D\n?\nx2\n1CC\nx\n?\nx2\n1 dx D 1\n3.x2\n1/3=2CC\nA shift of x (to x C2) or a multiple of x (rescaling to 2x) is particularly easy:\nEXAMPLES 9-10\nr\n.x C2/3dx D 1\n4.x C2/4CC\nr\ncos 2x dx D 1\n2 sin 2x CC\nYou will soon be able to do those in your sleep. Officially the derivative of .x C2/4\nuses the chain rule. But the inside function u D x C2 has du=dx D 1: The \"1\" is\nthere automatically, and the graph shifts over--as in Figure 5.8b.\nFor Example 10 the inside function is u D 2x: Its derivative is du=dx D 2: This\n\nIntegrals\nFig. 5.8\nSubstituting u D x C1 and u D 2x and u D x2: The last graph has half of du=dx D 2x:\nrequired factor 2 is missing in r\ncos 2x dx, but we put it there by multiplying and\ndividing by 2: Check the derivative of 1\n2 sin 2x: the 2 from the chain rule cancels the\n2: The rule for any nonzero constant is similar:\n»\nv.x Cc/ dx D f .x Cc/\nand\n»\nv.cx/ dx D 1\nc f .cx/:\n(2)\nSqueezing the graph by c divides the area by c: Now 3x C7 rescales and shifts:\nEXAMPLE 11\nr\ncos.3x C7/ dx D 1\n3 sin.3x C7/CC\nr\n.3x C7/2dx D 1\n3.3x C7/3CC\nRemark on writing down the steps When the substitution is complicated, it is a\ngood idea to get du=dx where you need it. Here 3x2 C1 needs 6x:\n»\n7x.3x2 C1/4dx D7\n»\n.3x2 C1/46x dx D 7\n»\nu4 du\ndx dx\nNow integrate:\nu5\n5 CC D 7\n.3x2 C1/5\nCC:\n(3)\nCheck the derivative at the end. The exponent 5 cancels 5 in the denominator,\n6x from the chain rule cancels 6, and 7x is what we started with.\nRemark on differentials In place of .du=dx/dx, many people just write du:\nr\n.3x2 C1/46x dx D\nr\nu4du D 1\n5u5 CC:\n(4)\nThis really shows how substitution works. We switch from x to u, and we also\nswitch from dx to du. The most common mistake is to confuse dx with du: The\nfactor du=dx from the chain rule is absolutely needed, to reach du: The change of\nvariables (dummy variables anyway!) leaves an easy integral, and then u turns back\ninto 3x2 C1: Here are the four steps to substitute u for x:\n1. Choose u.x/ and compute du=dx\n2. Locate v.u/ times du=dx times dx, or v.u/ times du\n3. Integrate\nr\nv.u/ du to find f .u/CC\n4. Substitute u.x/ back into this antiderivative f:\nEXAMPLE 12\nr\n.cos\n?x/ dx=2\n?x D\nr\ncos u du D sin uCC D sin\n?x CC\n(put in u)\n(integrate)\n(put back x)\nThe choice of u must be right, to change everything from x to u: With ingenuity,\nsome remarkable integrals are possible. But most will remain impossible forever.\nThe functions cos x2 and 1=\na\nsin2x have no \"elementary\" antiderivative. Those\nintegrals are well defined and they come up in applications--the latter gives the\n\n5.4\nIndefinite Integrals and Substitutions\ndistance around an ellipse.

This section takes\ntwo steps. First, we choose C . Second, we construct f .x/. The object is to define\nthe integral--in the most frequent case when a suitable f .x/ is not directly known.\nThe indefinite integral contains \"CC .\" The constant is not settled because\nf .x/CC has the same slope for every C . When we care only about the derivative,\nC makes no difference. When the goal is a number--a definite integral--C can be\nassigned a definite value at the starting point.\nFor mileage traveled, we subtract the reading at the start. This section does\nthe same for area. Distance is f .t/ and area is f .x/--while the definite integral\nis f .b/\nf .a/. Don't pay attention to t or x, pay attention to the great formula of\nintegral calculus:\n» b\na\nv.t/ dt D\n» b\na\nv.x/ dx D f .b/\nf .a/:\n(1)\nViewpoint 1 W When f is known, the equation gives the area from a to b.\nViewpoint 2 W When f is not known, the equation defines f from the area.\nFor a typical v.x/, we can't find f .x/ by guessing or substitution. But still v.x/ has\nan \"area\" under its graph--and this yields the desired integral f .x/.\nMost of this section is theoretical, leading to the definition of the integral. You may\nthink we should have defined integrals before computing them--which is logically\ntrue. But the idea of area (and the use of rectangles) was already pretty clear in our\nfirst examples. Now we go much further. Every continuous function v.x/ has an\nintegral (also some discontinuous functions). Then the Fundamental Theorem com-\npletes the circle: The integral leads back to df=dx D v.x/. The area up to x is the\nantiderivative that we couldn't otherwise discover.\nTHE CONSTANT OF INTEGRATION\nOur goal is to turn f .x/CC into a definite integral-- the area between a and b. The\nfirst requirement is to have area D zero at the start:\nf .a/CC D starting area D 0\nso\nC D\nf .a/:\n(2)\nFor the area up to x (moving endpoint, indefinite integral), use t as the dummy\nvariable:\nthe area from a to x is\nr x\na v.t/ dtD f .x/\nf .a/\n(indefinite integral)\nthe area from a to b is\nr b\na v.x/ dxD f .b/\nf .a/\n(definite integral)\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe area under the graph of 5.x C1/4 from a to b\nhas\nf .x/ D .x C1/5:\nr b\na 5.x C1/4dx D .x C1/5 ib\na D .b C1/5\n.aC1/5:\nThe calculation has two separate steps--first find f .x/, then substitute b and a. After\nthe first step, check that df=dx is v. The upper limit in the second step gives plus\n\n5.5\nThe Definite Integral\nf .b/, the lower limit gives minus f .a/. Notice the brackets (or the vertical bar):\nf .x/\nb\na D f .b/\nf .a/\nx3j2\n1 D 8\n\ncos x\n2t\n0 D cos 2t\n1:\nChanging the example to f .x/ D .x C1/5\n1 gives an equally good antiderivative--\nand now f .0/ D 0. But f .b/\nf .a/ stays the same, because the\n1 disappears:\nh\n.x C1/5\nib\na D ..b C1/5\n1/\n..aC1/5\n1/ D .b C1/5\n.aC1/5:\nEXAMPLE 2\nWhen v D 2x sin x2 we recognize f D\ncos x2. The area from\n0 to 3 is\nr 3\n0 2x sin x2 dx D\ncosx2i3\n0 D\ncos 9Ccos 0:\nThe upper limit copies the minus sign. The lower limit gives\n. cos 0/, which is\nCcos 0. That example shows the right form for solving exercises on definite\nintegrals.\nExample 2 jumped directly to f .x/ D\ncos x2. But most problems involving the\nchain rule go more slowly--by substitution. Set u D x2, with du=dx D 2x:\n» 3\n2x sin x2 dx D\n» 3\nsin udu\ndx dx D\n» ‹\n‹\nsin u du:\n(3)\nWe need new limits when u replaces x2. Those limits on u are a2 and b2. (In this\ncase a2 D 02 and b2 D 32 D 9.) If x goes from a to b, then u goes from u.a/ to\nu.b/.\n» b\na\nv.u.x//du\ndx dx D\n» u.b/\nu.a/\nv.u/ du D f .u.b//\nf .u.a//:\n(4)\nEXAMPLE 3\n» 1\nxD0\n.x2 C5/3x dx D\n» 6\nuD5\nu3 du\n2 D u4\n#6\nD 64\n8 .\nIn this case u D x2C5. Therefore du=dx D 2x (or du D 2x dx for differentials).\nWe have to account for the missing 2. The integral is 1\n8u4. The limits on u D x2C5\nare u.0/ D 02C5 and u.1/ D 12C5. That is why the u-integral goes from 5 to 6.\nThe alternative is to find f .x/ D 1\n8.x2 C5/4 in one jump (and check it).\nEXAMPLE 4\nr 1\n0 sin x2 dx D?? (no elementary function gives this integral).\nIf we try cos x2, the chain rule produces an extra 2x--no adjustment will work. Does\nsin x2 still have an antiderivative? Yes! Every continuous v.x/ has an f .x/. Whether\nf .x/ has an algebraic formula or not, we can write it as\nr\nv.x/dx. To define that\nintegral, we now take the limit of rectangular areas.\nINTEGRALS AS LIMITS OF \"RIEMANN SUMS\"\nWe have come to the definition of the integral. The chapter started with the\nintegrals of x and x2, from formulas for 1C\n\nCn and 12 C\n\nCn2. We will not\ngo back to those formulas. But for other functions, too irregular to find exact sums,\nthe rectangular areas also approach a limit.\nThat limit is the integral. This definition is a major step in the theory of calculus.\nIt can be studied in detail, or understood in principle. The truth is that the definition\nis not so painful--you virtually know it already.\n\nIntegrals\nProblem Integrate the continuous function v.x/ over the interval Œa;b.\nStep 1 Split Œa;b into n subintervals Œa;x1;Œx1;x2; :::;Œxn 1;b.\nThe \"meshpoints\" x1;x2; ::: divide up the interval from a to b. The endpoints are\nx0 D a and xn D b. The length of subinterval k is xk D xk\nxk\n1. In that smaller\ninterval, the minimum of v.x/ is mk. The maximum is Mk.\nNow construct rectangles. The \"lower rectangle\" over interval k has height mk.\nThe \"upper rectangle\" reaches to Mk. Since v is continuous, there are points xmin\nand xmax where v D mk and v D Mk (extreme value theorem). The graph of v.x/\nis in between.\nImportant: The area under v.x/ contains the area \"s\" of the lower rectangles:\nr b\na v.x/ dx\n¥ m1 x1 C m2 x2 C\n\nC mn xn D s:\n(5)\nThe area under v.x/ is contained in the area \"S\" of the upper rectangles:\nr b\na v.x/dx\n¤ M1 x1 C M2 x2 C\n\nC Mn xn D S:\n(6)\nThe lower sum s and the upper sum S were computed earlier in special cases--\nwhen v was x or x2 and the spacings x were equal. Figure 5.9a shows why s\n¤\narea\n¤ S.\nFig. 5.9\nArea of lower rectangles D s: Upper sum S includes top pieces. Riemann sum S\n\nis in between.\nNotice an important fact. When a new dividing point x\n1 is added, the lower sum\nincreases. The minimum in one piece can be greater (see second figure) than the\noriginal mk. Similarly the upper sum decreases. The maximum in one piece can be\nbelow the overall maximum. As new points are added, s goes up and S comes\ndown. So the sums come closer together:\ns\n¤ s\n¤\n¤ S\n¤ S:\n(7)\nI have left space in between for the curved area--the integral of v.x/.\nNow add more and more meshpoints in such a way that xmax\nN 0. The lower\nsums increase and the upper sums decrease. They never pass each other. If v.x/ is\ncontinuous, those sums close in on a single number A. That number is the definite\nintegral--the area under the graph.\nDEFINITION\nThe area A is the common limit of the lower and upper sums:\ns\nN A and S\nN A as xmax\nN 0:\n(8)\nThis limit A exists for all continuous v.x/, and also for some discontinuous functions.\nWhen it exists, A is the \"Riemann integral\" of v.x/ from a to b.\n\n5.5\nThe Definite Integral\nREMARKS ON THE INTEGRAL\nAs for derivatives, so for integrals: The definition involves a limit. Calculus is built\non limits, and we always add \"if the limit exists.\" That is the delicate point. I hope the\nnext five remarks (increasingly technical) will help to distinguish functions that are\nRiemann integrable from functions that are not.\nRemark 1\nThe sums s and S may fail to approach the same limit. A standard\nexample has V.x/ D 1 at all fractions x D p=q, and V.x/ D 0 at all other points.\nEvery interval contains rational points (fractions) and irrational points (nonrepeating\ndecimals). Therefore mk D 0 and Mk D 1. The lower sum is always s D 0. The upper\nsum is always S D b\na (the sum of 1's times x's). The gap in equation (7) stays\nopen. This function V.x/ is not Riemann integrable. The area under its graph is not\ndefined (at least by Riemann--see Remark 5).\nRemark 2\nThe step function U.x/ is discontinuous but still integrable. On every\ninterval the minimum mk equals the maximum Mk--except on the interval contain-\ning the jump. That jump interval has mk D 0 and Mk D 1. But when we multiply by\nxk, and require xmax\nN 0, the difference between s and S goes to zero. The area\nunder a step function is clear--the rectangles fit exactly.\nRemark 3\nWith patience another key step could be proved: If s\nN A and S\nN A\nfor one sequence of meshpoints, then this limit A is approached by every choice\nof meshpoints with xmax\nN 0. The integral is the lower bound of all upper sums\nS, and it is the upper bound of all possible s--provided those bounds are equal. The\ngap must close, to define the integral.\nThe same limit A is approached by \"in-between rectangles.\" The height v.x\n\nk/ can\nbe computed at any point x\n\nk in subinterval k. See Figures 5.9c and 5.10. Then the\ntotal rectangular area is a \"Riemann sum\" between s and S:\nS\nD v.x\n\n1/x1Cv.x\n\n2/x2 C\n\nC v.x\n\nn/xn:\n(9)\nWe cannot tell whether the true area is above or below S\n. Very often A is closer to S\n\nthan to s or S. The midpoint rule takes x\nin the middle of its interval (Figure 5.10),\nand Section 5.8 will establish its extra accuracy. The extreme sums s and S are used\nin the definition while S\nis used in computation.\nFig. 5.10\nVarious positions for x\n\nk in the base. The rectangles have height v.x\n\nk /.\nRemark 4\nEvery continuous function is Riemann integrable. The proof is op-\ntional (in my class), but it belongs here for reference. It starts with continuity at x\n:\n\"For any \" there is a ı . . . .\" When the rectangles sit between x\n\nı and x\nCı,\nthe bounds Mk and mk differ by less than 2\". Multiplying by the base xk, the ar-\neas differ by less than 2\".xk/. Combining all rectangles, the upper and lower sums\ndiffer by less than 2\".x1 Cx2C\n\nCxn/ D 2\".b\na/.\n\nIntegrals\nAs \"\nN 0 we conclude that S comes arbitrarily close to s. They squeeze in on a\nsingle number A. The Riemann sums approach the Riemann integral, if v is continu-\nous.\nTwo problems are hidden by that reasoning. One is at the end, where S and s come\ntogether. We have to know that the line of real numbers has no \"holes,\" so there is a\nnumber A to which these sequences converge. That is true.\nAny increasing sequence, if it is bounded above, approaches a limit.\nThe decreasing sequence S, bounded below, converges to the same limit. So A exists.\nThe other problem is about continuity. We assumed without saying so that the width\n2ı is the same around every point x\n. We did not allow for the possibility that ı might\napproach zero where v.x/ is rapidly changing--in which case an infinite number of\nrectangles could be needed. Our reasoning requires that\nv.x/ is uniformly continuous: ı depends on \" but not on the position of x\n.\nFor each \" there is a ı that works at all points in the interval. A continuous function\non a closed interval is uniformly continuous. This fact (proof omitted) makes the\nreasoning correct, and v.x/ is integrable.\nOn an infinite interval, even v D x2 is not uniformly continuous. It changes across a\nsubinterval by .x\nCı/2\n.x\n\nı/2 D 4x\nı. As x\ngets larger, ı must get smaller--\nto keep 4x\nı below \". No single ı succeeds at all x\n. But on a finite interval Œ0;b,\nthe choice ı D \"=4b works everywhere--so v D x2 is uniformly continuous.\nRemark 5\nIf those four remarks were fairly optional, this one is totally at your\ndiscretion. Modern mathematics needs to integrate the zero-one function V.x/ in the\nfirst remark. Somehow V has more 0's than 1's. The fractions (where V.x/ D 1) can\nbe put in a list, but the irrational numbers (where V.x/ D 0) are \"uncountable.\" The\nintegral ought to be zero, but Riemann's upper sums all involve Mk D 1.\nLebesgue discovered a major improvement. He allowed infinitely many subinter-\nvals (smaller and smaller). Then all fractions can be covered with intervals of total\nwidth \": (Amazing, when the fractions are packed so densely.) The idea is to cover\n1=q;2=q; :::;q=q by narrow intervals of total width \"=2q. Combining all\nq D 1;2;3; :::;\nthe\ntotal\nwidth\nto\ncover\nall\nfractions\nis\nno\nmore\nthan\n\"\n2 C 1\n4 C 1\n8 C\n\nD \". Since V.x/ D 0 everywhere else, the upper sum S is only\n\". And since \" was arbitrary, the \"Lebesgue integral\" is zero as desired.\nThat completes a fair amount of theory, possibly more than you want or need--\nbut it is satisfying to get things straight. The definition of the integral is still being\nstudied by experts (and so is the derivative, again to allow more functions). By\ncontrast, the properties of the integral are used by everybody. Therefore the next\nsection turns from definition to properties, collecting the rules that are needed in\napplications. They are very straightforward.\n\n5.5\nThe Definite Integral\n5.5\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nIn\nr x\nav.t/ dt D f .x/CC,\nthe\nconstant\nC\nequals\na\n.\nThen at x D a the integral is\nb\n.

The integral was defined in order to be used. Its properties are important, and\nits applications are even more important. The definition was chosen so that the\nintegral has properties that make the applications possible.\nOne direct application is to the average value of v.x/: The average of n numbers\nis clear, and the integral extends that idea--it produces the average of a whole\ncontinuum of numbers v.x/: This develops from the last rule in the following list\n(Property 7). We now collect together seven basic properties of definite integrals.\nThe addition rule for r\nŒv.x/Cw.x/dx will not be repeated--even though this\nproperty of linearity is the most fundamental. We start instead with a different kind of\naddition. There is only one function v.x/, but now there are two intervals.\nThe integral from a to b is added to its neighbor from b to c: Their sum is the\nintegral from a to c. That is the first (not surprising) property in the list.\nProperty 1\nAreas over neighboring intervals add to the area over the combined\ninterval:\nr b\na v.x/ dx Cr c\nb v.x/ dx D r c\na v.x/ dx:\n(1)\nThis sum of areas is graphically obvious (Figure 5.11a). It also comes from the formal\ndefinition of the integral. Rectangular areas obey (1)--with a meshpoint at x D b to\nmake sure. When xmax approaches zero, their limits also obey (1). All the normal\nrules for rectangular areas are obeyed in the limit by integrals.\nProperty 1 is worth pursuing. It indicates how to define the integral when a D b:\nThe integral \"from b to b\" is the area over a point, which we expect to be zero. It is.\nProperty 2\nr b\nb v.x/ dx D 0:\nThat comes from Property 1 when c D b: Equation (1) has two identical integrals, so\nthe one from b to b must be zero. Next we see what happens if c D a--which makes\nthe second integral go from b to a:\nWhat happens when an integral goes backward? The \"lower limit\" is now the\nlarger number b: The \"upper limit\" a is smaller. Going backward reverses the sign:\nProperty 3\nr a\nb v.x/ dx D\n\nr b\na v.x/ dx D f .a/\nf .b/:\nProof When c D a the right side of (1) is zero. Then the integrals on the left side\nmust cancel, which is Property 3. In going from b to a the steps x are negative.\nThat justifies a minus sign on the rectangular areas, and a minus sign on the integral\n(Figure 5.11b).

If v.x/ is positive, the area under its graph\nis positive (not surprising). Now we have a proof: The lower sums s are positive and\nthey increase toward the area integral. So the integral is positive:\nProperty 5\nIf v.x/\n¡ 0 for a\nx\nb then r b\na v.x/ dx\n¡ 0:\nA positive velocity means a positive distance. A positive v lies above a positive area.\nA more general statement is true.

First, we don't expect the number to be exactly\n2--so we need to define \"expected value.\" Second, if the expected value is 1\n2, why is\nthe expected square equal to 1\n3 instead of 1\n4? The ideas come from probability theory,\nand calculus is leading us to continuous probability. We introduce it briefly here,\nand come back to it in Chapter 8.\n\nIntegrals\nPREDICTABLE AVERAGES FROM RANDOM EVENTS\nSuppose you throw a pair of dice. The outcome is not predictable. Otherwise why\nthrow them? But the average over more and more throws is totally predictable.\nWe don't know what will happen, but we know its probability.\nFor dice, we are adding two numbers between 1 and 6: The outcome is between 2\nand 12: The probability of 2 is the chance of two ones: .1=6/.1=6/ D 1=36: Beside\neach outcome we can write its probability:\n\nTo repeat, one roll is unpredictable. Only the probabilities are known, and they add\nto 1: (Those fractions add to 36=36; all possibilities are covered.) The total from a\nmillion rolls is even more unpredictable--it can be anywhere between 2;000;000 and\n12;000;000: Nevertheless the average of those million outcomes is almost com-\npletely predictable. This expected value is found by adding the products in that line\nabove:\nExpected value: multiply (outcome) times (probability of outcome) and add:\n36 C 6\n36 C 12\n36 C 20\n36 C 30\n36 C 42\n36 C 40\n36 C 36\n36 C 30\n36 C 22\n36 C 12\n36 D 7:\nIf you throw the dice 1000 times, and the average is not between 6:9 and 7:1, you get\nan A. Use the random number generator on a computer and round off to integers.\nNow comes continuous probability. Suppose all numbers between 2 and 12 are\nequally probable. This means all numbers--not just integers. What is the probability\nof hitting the particular number x D ? It is zero! By any reasonable measure, has\nno chance to occur. In the continuous case, every x has probability zero. But an\ninterval of x's has a nonzero probability:\nthe probability of an outcome between 2 and 3 is 1=10\nthe probability of an outcome between x and x Cx is x=10\nTo find the average, add up each outcome times the probability of that outcome.\nFirst divide 2 to 12 into intervals of length x D 1 and probability p D 1=10: If\nwe round off x, the average is 6 1\n2:\n\nC3\n\nC\n\nC11\n\nD 6:5:\nHere all outcomes are integers (as with dice). It is more accurate to use 20 intervals\nof length 1=2 and probability 1=20: The average is 6 3\n4, and you see what is coming.\nThese are rectangular areas (Riemann sums). As x\nN 0 they approach an integral.\nThe probability of an outcome between x and x Cdx is p.x/ dx, and this problem\nhas p.x/ D 1=10: The average outcome in the continuous case is not a sum but\nan integral:\nexpected value E.x/ D\n» 12\nxp.x/ dx D\n» 12\nx dx\n10 D x2\nD 7:\nThat is a big jump. From the point of view of integration, it is a limit of sums. From the\npoint of view of probability, the chance of each outcome is zero but the probability\n\n5.6\nProperties of the Integral and Average Value\ndensity at x is p.x/ D 1=10: The integral of p.x/ is 1, because some outcome must\nhappen. The integral of xp.x/ is xave D 7, the expected value. Each choice of x is\nrandom, but the average is predictable.\nThis completes a first step in probability theory. The second step comes after more\ncalculus. Decaying probabilities use e\nx and e\nx2--then the chance of a large x is\nvery small. Here we end with the expected values of xn and 1=\n?x and 1=x, for a\nrandom choice between 0 and 1 (so p.x/ D 1):\nE.xn/ D\n» 1\nxn dx D\nnC1\nE\n?x\n\nD\n» 1\ndx\n?x D 2\nE\nx\n\nD\n» 1\ndx\nx D\n8.S/\nA CONFUSION ABOUT \"EXPECTED\" CLASS SIZE\nA college can advertise an average class size of 29; while most students are in large\nclasses most of the time. I will show quickly how that happens.\nSuppose there are 95 classes of 20 students and 5 classes of 200 students. The total\nenrollment in 100 classes is 1900C1000 D 2900: A random professor has expected\nclass size 29: But a random student sees it differently. The probability is 1900=2900\nof being in a small class and 1000=2900 of being in a large class. Adding class size\ntimes probability gives the expected class size for the student:\n.20/\n\nC.200/\n\nD 82 students in the class.\nSimilarly, the average waiting time at a restaurant seems like 40 minutes (to the\ncustomer). To the hostess, who averages over the whole day, it is 10 minutes. If you\ncame at a random time it would be 10, but if you are a random customer it is 40:\nTraffic problems could be eliminated by raising the average number of people per\ncar to 2:5, or even 2: But that is virtually impossible. Part of the problem is the\ndifference between (a) the percentage of cars with one person and (b) the percentage\nof people alone in a car. Percentage (b) is smaller. In practice, most people would be\nin crowded cars. See Problems 37\n38:\n5.6\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe integrals\nr b\n0 v.x/ dx and\nr 5\nb v.x/ dx add to\na\n.

When the upper\nlimit is a variable point x, we have an indefinite integral. More generally: When the\nendpoints depend in any way on x, the integral is a function of x: Therefore we\ncan find its derivative. This requires the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\nThe essence of the Theorem is: Derivative of integral of v equals v. We also\ncompute the derivative when the integral goes from a.x/ to b.x/--both limits vari-\nable.\nPart 2 of the Fundamental Theorem reverses the order: Integral of derivative of f\nequals f CC . That will follow quickly from Part 1, with help from the Mean Value\nTheorem. It is Part 2 that we use most, since integrals are harder than derivatives.\nAfter the proofs we go to new applications, beyond the standard problem of area\nunder a curve. Integrals can add up rings and triangles and shells--not just rectangles.\nThe answer can be a volume or a probability--not just an area.\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM, PART 1\nStart with a continuous function v: Integrate it from a fixed point a to a variable\npoint x: For each x, this integral f .x/ is a number. We do not require or expect a\nformula for f .x/--it is the area out to the point x: It is a function of x! The\nFundamental Theorem says that this area function has a derivative (another limiting\nprocess). The derivative df=dx equals the original v.x/:\n5C (Fundamental Theorem, Part 1) Suppose v.x/ is a continuous function:\nIf\nf .x/ D\nr x\na v.t/ dt\nthen\ndf=dx D v.x/:\nThe dummy variable is written as t, so we can concentrate on the limits. The value of\nthe integral depends on the limits a and x, not on t:\nTo find df=dx, start with f D f .x Cx/\nf .x/ D difference of areas:\nf D\nr xCx\na\nv.t/ dt\n\nr x\na v.t/ dt D\nr xCx\nx\nv.t/ dt:\n(1)\nOfficially, this is Property 1: The area out to x Cx minus the area out to x equals\nthe small part from x to x Cx: Now divide by x:\nf\nx D 1\nx\n» xCx\nx\nv.t/ dt D average value D v.c/:\n(2)\nThis is Property 7, the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. The average value on this\nshort interval equals v.c/: This point c is somewhere between x and x Cx (exact\nposition not known), and we let x approach zero. That squeezes c toward x, so\nv.c/ approaches u.x/--remember that v is continuous. The limit of equation (2) is\nthe Fundamental Theorem:\nf\nx\nN df\ndx\nand\nv.c/\nN v.x/\nso\ndf\ndx D v.x/:\n(3)\nIf x is negative the reasoning still holds. Why assume that v.x/ is continuous?\nBecause if v is a step function, then f .x/ has a corner where df=dx is not v.x/:\n\nIntegrals\nWe could skip the Mean Value Theorem and simply bound v above and below:\nfor t between x and x CxW\nvmin\n¤\nv.t/\n¤vmax\nintegrate over that interval:\nvminx\n¤\nf\n¤vmaxx\ndivide by xW\nvmin\n¤f=x\n¤vmax\n(4)\nAs x\nN 0, vmin and vmax approach v.x/: In the limit df=dx again equals v.x/:\nFig. 5.14\nFundamental Theorem, Part 1: (thin area f )=(base length x)N height v.x/:\nGraphical meaning The f-graph gives the area under the v-graph. The thin strip in\nFigure 5.14 has area f: That area is approximately v.x/ times x. Dividing by\nits base, f=x is close to the height v.x/: When x\nN 0 and the strip becomes\ninfinitely thin, the expression \"close to\" converges to \"equals.\" Then df=dx is the\nheight at v.x/:\nDERIVATIVES WITH VARIABLE ENDPOINTS\nWhen the upper limit is x, the derivative is v.x/: Suppose the lower limit is x: The\nintegral goes from x to b, instead of a to x: When x moves, the lower limit moves.\nThe change in area is on the left side of Figure 5.15. As x goes forward, area is\nremoved. So there is a minus sign in the derivative of area:\nThe derivative of\ng.x/ D\n» b\nx\nv.t/ dt\nis\ndg\ndx D\nv.x/:\n(5)\nThe quickest proof is to reverse b and x, which reverses the sign (Property 3):\ng.x/ D\n\n» x\nb\nv.t/ dt\nso by Part 1\ndg\ndx D\nv.x/:\nFig. 5.15\nArea from x to b has dg=dx D\nv.x/: Area v.b/db is added, area v.a/da is lost\nThe general case is messier but not much harder (it is quite useful). Suppose both\nlimits are changing. The upper limit b.x/ is not necessarily x, but it depends on x:\n\n5.7\nThe Fundamental Theorem and Its Applications\nThe lower limit a.x/ can also depend on x (Figure 5.15b). The area A between those\nlimits changes as x changes, and we want dA=dx:\nIf\nA D\n» b.x/\na.x/\nv.t/ dt\nthen\ndA\ndx D v.b.x//db\ndx\nv.a.x//da\ndx:\n(6)\nThe figure shows two thin strips, one added to the area and one subtracted.\nFirst check the two cases we know. When a D 0 and b D x, we have da=dx D 0\nand db=dx D 1: The derivative according to (6) is v.x/ times 1--the Fundamental\nTheorem. The other case has a D x and b D constant. Then the lower limit in (6)\nproduces\nv.x/: When the integral goes from a D 2x to b D x3, its derivative is\nnew:\nEXAMPLE 1\nAD\nr x3\n2x cos t dt D sin x3\nsin 2x\ndA=dx D .cos x3/.3x2/\n.cos 2x/.2/:\nThat fits with (6), because db=dx is 3x2 and da=dx is 2 (with minus sign). It also\nlooks like the chain rule--which it is! To prove (6) we use the letters v and f :\nA D\n» b.x/\na.x/\nv.t/ dt D f .b.x//\nf .a.x//\n(by Part 2 below)\ndA\ndx D f\n1.b.x//db\ndx\nf\n1.a.x//da\ndx\n(by the chain rule)\nSince f\n1 D v, equation (6) is proved. In the next example the area turns out to be\nconstant, although it seems to depend on x: Note that v.t/ D 1=t so v.3x/ D 1=3x:\nEXAMPLE 2\nA D\n» 3x\n2x\nt dt has dA\ndx D\n3x\n\n.3/\n\n2x\n\n.2/ D 0:\nQuestion A D\n» x\nx\nv.t/ dt has dA\ndx D v.x/Cv. x/: Why does v. x/ have a plus sign?\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM, PART 2\nWe have used a hundred times the Theorem that is now to be proved. It is the key to\nintegration. \"The integral of df=dx is f .x/CC .\" The application starts with v.x/:\nWe search for an f .x/ with this derivative. If df=dx D v.x/, the Theorem says that\n»\nv.x/ dx D\n» df\ndx dx D f .x/CC:\nWe can't rely on knowing formulas for v and f--only the definitions of\nr\nand d=dx:\nThe proof rests on one extremely special case: df=dx is the zero function.\nWe easily find f .x/ D constant. The problem is to prove that there are no other\npossibilities: f must be constant. When the slope is zero, the graph must be flat.\nEverybody knows this is true, but intuition is not the same as proof.\nAssume that df=dx D 0 in an interval. If f .x/ is not constant, there are points\nwhere f .a/ ¤ f .b/: By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point c where\nf\n1.c/ D f .b/\nf .a/\nb\na\n.this is not zero becausef .a/ ¤ f .b//:\nBut f\n1.c/ ¤ 0 directly contradicts df=dx D 0: Therefore f .x/ must be constant.\n\nIntegrals\nNote the crucial role of the Mean Value Theorem. A local hypothesis (df=dx D 0\nat each point) yields a global conclusion (f D constant in the whole interval). The\nderivative narrows the field of view, the integral widens it. The Mean Value Theorem\nconnects instantaneous to average, local to global, points to intervals. This special\ncase (the zero function) applies when A.x/ and f .x/ have the same derivative:\nIf dA=dx D df=dx on an interval; then A.x/ D f .x/CC:\n(7)\nReason: The derivative of A.x/\nf .x/ is zero. So A.x/\nf .x/ must be constant.\nNow comes the big theorem. It assumes that v.x/ is continuous, and integrates\nusing f .x/:\n5D (Fundamental Theorem, Part 2) If v.x/ D df\ndx then\n» b\na\nv.x/dxDf .b/\nf .a/:\nProof The antiderivative is f .x/: But Part 1 gave another antiderivative for the same\nv.x/: It was the integral--constructed from rectangles and now called A.x/:\nA.x/ D\n» x\na\nv.t/ dt\nalso has\ndA\ndx D v.x/:\nSince A\n1 D v and f\n1 D v, the special case in equation (7) states that A.x/ D f .x/C\nC: That is the essential point: The integral from rectangles equals f .x/CC .\nAt the lower limit the area integral is A D 0: So f .a/CC D 0: At the upper limit\nf .b/CC D A.b/: Subtract to find A.b/, the definite integral:\nA.b/ D r b\na v.x/ dx D f .b/\nf .a/:\nCalculus is beautiful--its Fundamental Theorem is also its most useful theorem.\nAnother proof of Part 2 starts with f\n1 D v and looks at subintervals:\nf .x1/\nf .a/D v.x\n\n1/.x1\na/\n(by the Mean Value Theorem)\nf .x2/\nf .x1/ D v.x\n\n2/.x2\nx1/\n(by the Mean Value Theorem)\n::: D :::\nf .b/\nf .xn 1/ D v.x\n\nn/.b\nxn 1/\n(by the Mean Value Theorem).\nThe left sides add to f .b/\nf .a/: The sum on the right, as x\nN 0, is r b\na v.x/ dx:\nAPPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION\nUp to now the integral has been the area under a curve. There are many other\napplications, quite different from areas. Whenever addition becomes \"continuous,\"\nwe have integrals instead of sums. Chapter 8 has space to develop more applica-\ntions, but four examples can be given immediately--which will make the point.\nWe stay with geometric problems, rather than launching into physics or\nengineering or biology or economics. All those will come. The goal here is to take\na first step away from rectangles.\n\n5.7\nThe Fundamental Theorem and Its Applications\nEXAMPLE 3\n(for circles) The area A and circumference C are related by\ndA=dr D C .\nThe question is why. The area is r2: Its derivative 2r is the circumference. By\nthe Fundamental Theorem, the integral of C is A: What is missing is the geometrical\nreason. Certainly r2 is the integral of 2r, but what is the real explanation for\nA D\nr\nC.r/dr?\nMy point is that the pieces are not rectangles. We could squeeze rectangles under\na circular curve, but their heights would have nothing to do with C: Our intuition has\nto take a completely different direction, and add up the thin rings in Figure 5.16.\nFig. 5.16\nArea of circle D integral over rings. Volume of sphere D integral over shells.\nSuppose the ring thickness is r: Then the ring area is close to C times r: This\nis precisely the kind of approximation we need, because its error is of higher order\n.r/2: The integral adds ring areas just as it added rectangular areas:\nA D\n» r\nC dr D\n» r\n2r dr D r2:\nThat is our first step toward freedom, away from rectangles to rings.\nThe ring area A can be checked exactly--it is the difference of circles:\nA D .r Cr/2\nr2 D 2r r C.r/2:\nThis is Cr plus a correction. Dividing both sides by r\nN 0 leaves dA=dr D C:\nFinally there is a geometrical reason. The ring unwinds into a thin strip. Its width\nis r and its length is close to C: The inside and outside circles have different\nperimeters, so this is not a true rectangle--but the area is near Cr:\nEXAMPLE 4\nFor a sphere, surface area and volume satisfy A D dV=dr:\nWhat worked for circles will work for spheres. The thin rings become thin shells. A\nshell goes from radius r to radius r Cr, so its thickness is r: We want the volume\nof the shell, but we don't need it exactly. The surface area is 4r2, so the volume is\nabout 4r2 r: That is close enough!\nAgain we are correct except for .r/2: Infinitesimally speaking dV D A dr:\nV D\n» r\nA dr D\n» r\n4r2 dr D 4\n3r3:\nThis is the volume of a sphere. The derivative of V is A, and the shells explain why.\nMain point: Integration is not restricted to rectangles.\n\nIntegrals\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe distance around a square is 4s: Why does the area have\ndA=ds D 2s?\nThe side is s and the area is s2: Its derivative 2s goes only half way around the\nsquare. I tried to understand that by drawing a figure. Normally this works, but in the\nfigure dA=ds looks like 4s: Something is wrong. The bell is ringing so I leave this as\nan exercise.\nEXAMPLE 6\nFind the area under v.x/ D cos\n1x from x D 0 to x D 1:\nThat is a conventional problem, but we have no antiderivative for cos\n1x: We could\nlook harder, and find one. However there is another solution--unconventionalbut cor-\nrect. The region can be filled with horizontal rectangles (not vertical rectangles).\nFigure 5.17b shows a typical strip of length x D cos v (the curve has v D cos\n1x). As\nthe thickness v approaches zero, the total area becomes\nr\nx dv: We are integrating\nupward, so the limits are on v not on x:\narea D r =2\ncos v dv D sin v\ni=2\nD 1:\nThe exercises ask you to set up other integrals--not always with rectangles.\nArchimedes used triangles instead of rings to find the area of a circle.\nFig. 5.17\nTrouble with a square. Success with horizontal strips and triangles.\n5.7\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe area f .x/D\nr x\na v.t/ dt is a function of\na\n.

The inputs are y.x/ and two endpoints\na and b: The output is the integral I: Our goal is to find that number\nr b\nay.x/ dx D I, accurately and in a short time. Normally this goal is achievable--as\nsoon as we have a good method for computing integrals.\nOur two approaches so far have weaknesses. The search for an antiderivative\nsucceeds in important cases, and Chapter 7 extends that range--but generally f .x/\nis not available. The other approach (by rectangles) is in the right direction but too\ncrude. The height is set by y.x/ at the right and left end of each small interval. The\nright and left rectangle rules add the areas (x times y):\nRn D .x/.y1Cy2C\n\nCyn/\nand\nLn D .x/.y0Cy1 C\n\nCyn 1/:\nThe value of y.x/ at the end of interval j is yj: The extreme left value y0 D y.a/\nenters Ln: With n equal intervals of length x D .b\na/=n, the extreme right value\nis yn D y.b/: It enters Rn: Otherwise the sums are the same--simple to compute,\neasy to visualize, but very inaccurate.\nThis section goes from slow methods (rectangles) to better methods (trapezoidal\nand midpoint) to good methods (Simpson and Gauss). Each improvement cuts down\nthe error. You could discover the formulas without the book, by integrating x and x2\nand x4: The rule Rn would come out on one side of the answer, and Ln would be\non the other side. You would figure out what to do next, to come closer to the exact\nintegral. The book can emphasize one key point:\nThe quality of a formula depends on how many integrals\nr\n1 dx;\nr\nx dx;\nr\nx2 dx; :::; it computes exactly. If\nr\nxp dx\nis the first to be wrong, the order of accuracy is p:\nBy testing the integrals of 1;x;x2; :::, we decide how accurate the formulas are.\nFigure 5.18 shows the rectangle rules Rn and Ln: They are already wrong when\ny D x. These methods are first-order: p D 1: The errors involve the first power of\nx--where we would much prefer a higher power. A larger p in .x/p means a\nsmaller error.\nFig. 5.18\nErrors E and e in Rn and Ln are the areas of triangles.\nWhen the graph of y.x/ is a straight line, the integral I is known. The error\ntriangles E and e have base x: Their heights are the differences yj C1\nyj: The\nareas are 1\n2(base)(height), and the only difference is a minus sign. (L is too low, so\nthe error L\nI is negative.) The total error in Rn is the sum of the E's:\nRn\nI D 1\n2x.y1\ny0/C\n\nC 1\n2x.yn\nyn 1/ D 1\n2x.yn\ny0/:\n(1)\nAll y's between y0 and yn cancel. Similarly for the sum of the e's:\nLn\nI D\n2x.yn\ny0/ D\n2xŒy.b/\ny.a/:\n(2)\n\nIntegrals\nThe greater the slope of y.x/, the greater the error--since rectangles have zero slope.\nFormulas (1) and (2) are nice--but those errors are large. To integrate y D x\nfrom a D 0 to b D 1; the error is 1\n2x.1\n0/: It takes 500;000 rectangles to reduce\nthis error to 1=1;000;000. This accuracy is reasonable, but that many rectangles is\nunacceptable.\nThe beauty of the error formulas is that they are \"asymptotically correct\" for all\nfunctions. When the graph is curved, the errors don't fit exactly into triangles. But\nthe ratio of predicted error to actual error approaches 1. As x\nN 0, the graph is\nalmost straight in each interval--this is linear approximation.\nThe error prediction 1\n2xŒy.b/\ny.a/ is so simple that we test it on y.x/ D\n?x:\nI D\nr 1\n?x dx D 2\nn D\nerror Rn\nI D\n:33\n:044\n:0048\n:00049\nerror Ln\nI D\n:67\n:056\n:0052\n:00051\nThe error decreases along each row. So does x D :1;:01;:001;:0001: Multiplying\nn by 10 divides x by 10: The error is also divided by 10 (almost). The error is\nnearly proportional to x--typical of first-order methods.\nThe predicted error is 1\n2x, since here y.1/ D 1 and y.0/ D 0: The computed er-\nrors in the table come closer and closer to 1\n2x D :5;:05;:005;:0005:The prediction\nis the \"leading term\" in the actual error.\nThe table also shows a curious fact. Subtracting the last row from the row\nabove gives exact numbers 1;:1;:01; and .001: This is .Rn\nI/\n.Ln\nI/; which\nis Rn\nLn: It comes from an extra rectangle at the right, included in Rn but not Ln:\nIts height is 1 and its area is 1;:1;:01;:001:\nThe errors in Rn and Ln almost cancel. The average Tn D 1\n2.Rn CLn/ has\nless error--it is the \"trapezoidal rule.\" First we give the rectangle prediction two final\ntests:\nn D 1\nn D 10\nn D 100\nn D 1000\nr\n.x2\nx/dx W\nerrors\n1:7\n1:7\n1:7\n1:7\nr\ndx=.10Ccos 2x/ W\nerrors\n\"0\"\n\"0\"\nThose errors are falling faster than x: For y D x2\nx the prediction explains why:\ny.0/ equals y.1/: The leading term, with y.b/ minus y.a/, is zero. The exact errors\nare 1\n6.x/2, dropping from 10\n1 to 10\n3 to 10\n5 to 10\n7: In these examples Ln is\nidentical to Rn (and also to Tn), because the end rectangles are the same. We will see\nthese 1\n6.x/2 errors in the trapezoidal rule.\nThe last row in the table is more unusual. It shows practically no error. Why do the\nrectangle rules suddenly achieve such an outstanding success?\nThe reason is that y.x/ D 1=.10Ccos 2x/ is periodic. The leading term in the\nerror is zero, because y.0/ D y.1/: Also the next term will be zero, because\ny\n1.0/ D y\n1.1/: Every power of x is multiplied by zero, when we integrate over\na complete period. So the errors go to zero exponentially fast.\nPersonal note I tried to integrate 1=.10Ccos2x/ by hand and failed. Then I was\nembarrassed to discover the answer in my book on applied mathematics. The method\nwas a special trick using complex numbers, which applies over an exact period.\nFinally I found the antiderivative (quite complicated) in a handbook of integrals, and\nverified the area 1=\n?\n99:\n\n5.8\nNumerical Integration\nTHE TRAPEZOIDAL AND MIDPOINT RULES\nWe move to integration formulas that are exact when y D x: They have\nsecond-order accuracy. The x error term disappears. The formulas give the\ncorrect area under straight lines. The predicted error is a multiple of .x/2: That\nmultiple is found by testing y D x2--for which the answers are not exact.\nThe first formula combines Rn and Ln: To cancel as much error as possible, take\nthe average 1\n2.Rn CLn/: This yields the trapezoidal rule, which approximates\nr\ny.x/ dx by Tn:\nTn D 1\n2Rn C 1\n2Ln D x. 1\n2y0 Cy1 C\n\nCyn 1 C 1\n2yn/:\n(3)\nAnother way to find Tn is from the area of the \"trapezoid\" below y D x in Figure 5.19a.\nFig. 5.19\nSecond-order accuracy: The error prediction is based on v D x2:\nThe base is x and the sides have heights yj\n1 and yj: Adding those areas gives\n2.Ln CRn/ in formula (3)--the coefficients of yj combine into 1\n2 C 1\n2 D 1: Only the\nfirst and last intervals are missing a neighbor, so the rule has 1\n2y0 and 1\n2yn: Because\ntrapezoids (unlike rectangles) fit under a sloping line, Tn is exact when y D x:\nWhat is the difference from rectangles? The trapezoidal rule gives weight 1\n2x to\ny0 and yn: The rectangle rule Rn gives full weight x to yn (and no weight to y0).\nRn\nTn is exactly the leading error 1\n2yn\n2y0: The change to Tn knocks out that\nerror.\nAnother important formula is exact for y.x/ D x: A rectangle has the same area\nas a trapezoid, if the height of the rectangle is halfway between yj\n1 and yj : On a\nstraight line graph that is achieved at the midpoint of the interval. By evaluating y.x/\nat the halfway points 1\n2x; 3\n2x; 5\n2x; :::, we get much better rectangles. This leads\nto the midpoint rule Mn:\nMn D x.y1=2Cy3=2 C\n\nCyn 1=2/:\n(4)\nFor\nr 4\n0 x dx, trapezoids give 1\n2.0/C1C2C3C 1\n2.4/ D 8: The midpoint rule gives\n2 C 3\n2 C 5\n2 C 7\n2 D 8, again correct. The rules become different when y D x2; because\ny1=2 is no longer the average of y0 and y1: Try both second-order rules on x2:\nI D r 1\n0 x2 dx\nn D\nerror Tn\nI D\n1=6\n1=600\n1=60000\nerror Mn\nI D\n1=12\n1=1200\n1=120000\nThe errors fall by 100 when n is multiplied by 10: The midpoint rule is twice as\ngood ( 1=12 vs. 1=6). Since all smooth functions are close to parabolas (quadratic\n\nIntegrals\napproximation in each interval), the leading errors come from Figure 5.19. The\ntrapezoidal error is exactly 1\n6.x/2 when y.x/ is x2 (the 12 in the formula divides\nthe 2 in y\n1):\nTn\nI\n12.x/2\n.y\ny\n0/C\n\nC.y\nn\ny\nn 1/\n\nD 1\n12.x/2\ny\nn\ny\n\n(5)\nMn\nI\n\n24.x/2\ny\nn\ny\n\nD\n24.x/2\ny\n1.b/\ny\n1.a/\n\n(6)\nFor exact error formulas, change y\n1.b/\ny\n1.a/ to .b\na/y\n2.c/: The location of\nc is unknown (as in the Mean Value Theorem). In practice these formulas are not\nmuch used--they involve the pth derivative at an unknown location c: The main\npoint about the error is the factor .x/p:\nOne crucial fact is easy to overlook in our tests. Each value of y.x/ can be ex-\ntremely hard to compute. Every time a formula asks for yj, a computer calls a sub-\nroutine. The goal of numerical integration is to get below the error tolerance, while\ncalling for a minimum number of values of y. Second-order rules need about a thou-\nsand values for a typical tolerance of 10\n6: The next methods are better.\nFOURTH-ORDER RULE: SIMPSON\nThe trapezoidal error is nearly twice the midpoint error (1=6 vs.\n1=12). So a good\ncombination will have twice as much of Mn as Tn: That is Simpson's rule:\nSn D 1\n3Tn C 2\n3Mn D 1\n6x\n\ny0 C4y1=2C2y1C4y3=2C2y2 C\n\nC4yn 1=2Cyn\n\n:\n(7)\nMultiply the midpoint values by 2=3 D 4=6: The endpoint values are multiplied by\n2=6; except at the far ends a and b (with heights y0 and yn). This 1\n\n1 pattern has become famous.\nSimpson's rule goes deeper than a combination of T and M: It comes from a\nparabolic approximation to y.x/ in each interval. When a parabola goes through y0;\ny1=2;y1, the area under it is\n6x.y0C4y1=2Cy1/. This is S over the first\ninterval. All our rules are constructed this way: Integrate correctly as many\npowers 1;x;x2; ::: as possible. Parabolas are better than straight lines, which are\nbetter than flat pieces. S beats M, which beats R: Check Simpson's rule on powers\nof x, with x D 1=n:\nn D 1\nn D 10\nn D 100\nerror if y D x2\nerror if y D x3\nerror if y D x4\n8:33\n8:33\n8:33\nExact answers for x2 are no surprise. Sn was selected to get parabolas right. But the\nzero errors for x3 were not expected. The accuracy has jumped to fourth order, with\nerrors proportional to .x/4: That explains the popularity of Simpson's rule.\nTo understand why x3 is integrated exactly, look at the interval Œ 1;1: The odd\nfunction x3 has zero integral, and Simpson agrees by symmetry:\n» 1\nx3 dx D 1\n4x4\nD 0\nand\nh\n. 1/3C4.0/3C13i\nD 0:\n(8)\n\n5.8\nNumerical Integration\nFig. 5.20\nSimpson\nversus\nGauss: E D c.x/4.y\njC1\ny\nj /\nwith\ncS D 1=2880\nand\ncG D\n1=4320:\nTHE GAUSS RULE (OPTIONAL)\nWe need a competitor for Simpson, and Gauss can compete with anybody. He\ncalculated integrals in astronomy, and discovered that two points are enough for\na fourth-order method. From\n1 to 1 (a single interval) his rule is\nr 1\n1 y.x/ dx\ny. 1=\n?\n3/Cy.1=\n?\n3/:\n(9)\nThose \"Gauss points\" x D\n1=\n?\n3 and x D 1=\n?\n3 can be found directly. By placing\nthem symmetrically, all odd powers x;x3; ::: are correctly integrated. The key is in\ny D x2, whose integral is 2=3: The Gauss points\nxG and CxG get this integral\nright:\n3 D . xG/2 C.xG/2; so x2\nG D 1\nand\nxG D\n?\n:\nFigure 5.20c shifts to the interval from 0 to x: The Gauss points are\n.1\n1=\n?\n3/x=2: They are not as convenient as Simpson's (which hand calcula-\ntors prefer). Gauss is good for thousands of integrations over one interval. Simpson is\ngood when intervals go back to back--then Simpson also uses two y's per interval.\nFor y D x4, you see both errors drop by 10\n4 in comparing n D 1 to n D 10:\nI D r 1\n0 x4 dx\nSimpson error\n8:33\n8:33\nGauss error\n5:56\n5:56\nDEFINITE INTEGRALS ON A CALCULATOR\nIt is fascinating to know how numerical integration is actually done. The points are\nnot equally spaced! For an integral from 0 to 1, Hewlett-Packard machines might\ninternally replace x by 3u2\n2u3 (the limits on u are also 0 and 1). The machine\nremembers to change dx: For example,\n» 1\ndx\n?x\nbecomes\n» 1\n6.u\nu2/du\n?\n3u2\n2u3 D\n» 1\n6.1\nu/du\n?\n2u\n:\nAlgebraically that looks worse--but the infinite value of 1=\n?x at x D 0 disappears\nat u D 0: The differential 6.u\nu2/du was chosen to vanish at u D 0 and u D 1: We\ndon't need y.x/ at the endpoints--where infinity is most common. In the u variable\nthe integration points are equally spaced--therefore in x they are not.\nWhen a difficult point is inside Œa;b, break the interval in two pieces. And chop\noff integrals that go out to infinity. The integral of e\nx2 should be stopped by x D 10,\n\nIntegrals\nsince the tail is so thin. (It is bad to go too far.) Rapid oscillations are among the\ntoughest--the answer depends on cancellation of highs and lows, and the\ncalculator requires many integration points.\nThe change from x to u affects periodic functions. I thought equal spacing was\ngood, since 1=.10Ccos 2x/ was integrated above to enormous accuracy. But there\nis a danger called aliasing. If sin 8x is sampled with x D 1=8, it is always zero.\nA high frequency 8 is confused with a low frequency 0 (its \"alias\" which agrees at\nthe sample points). With unequal spacing the problem disappears. Notice how any\nintegration method can be deceived:\nAsk for the integral of y D 0 and specify the accuracy. The calculator\nsamples y at x1; :::;xk: (With a PAUSE key, the x's may be displayed.)\nThen integrate Y.x/ D .x\nx1/2\n\n.x\nxk/2: That also returns the\nanswer zero (now wrong), because the calculator follows the same steps.\nOn the calculator you enter the function, the endpoints, and the accuracy. The\nvariable x can be named or not (see the margin). The outputs 4:67077 and 4.7E-5\nare the requested integral\nr 2\n1 ex dx and the estimated error bound. Your input\naccuracy .00001 guarantees\nrelative error in y D\n\ntrue y\ncomputed y\ncomputed y\n\n¤ :00001:\nThe machine estimates accuracy based on its experience in sampling y.x/: If you\nguaranteeex within .00000000001;it thinks you want high accuracy and takes longer.\nIn consulting for HP, William Kahan chose formulas using 1;3;7;15; ::: sample\npoints. Each new formula uses the samples in the previous formula. The calculator\nstops when answers are close.\n\n5.8\nNumerical Integration\n5.8\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nTo integrate y.x/, divide Œa;b into n pieces of length x D\na\n.\nRn\nand\nLn\nplace\na\nb\nover\neach\npiece,\nusing\nthe\nheight at the right or\nc\nendpoint: Rn D x.y1 C\n\nCyn/\nand Ln D\nd\n.

      "content": "CHAPTER 6\nExponentials and Logarithms\nThis chapter is devoted to exponentials like 2x and 10x and above all ex: The goal\nis to understand them, differentiate them, integrate them, solve equations with them,\nand invert them (to reach the logarithm). The overwhelming importance of ex makes\nthis a crucial chapter in pure and applied mathematics.\nIn the traditional order of calculus books, ex waits until other applications of the\nintegral are complete. I would like to explain why it is placed earlier here. I believe\nthat the equation dy=dx D y has to be emphasized above techniques of integration.\nThe laws of nature are expressed by differential equations, and at the center is ex: Its\napplications are to life sciences and physical sciences and economics and engineering\n(and more--wherever change is influenced by the present state). The model produces\na differential equation and I want to show what calculus can do.\nThe key is always bmCn D .bm/.bn/: Section 6:1 applies that rule in three ways:\n1. to understand the logarithm as the exponent;\n2. to draw graphs on ordinary and semilog and log-log paper;\n3. to find derivatives. The slope of bx will use bxCx D .bx/.bx/:\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\n6.1 An Overview\nThere is a good chance you have met logarithms. They turn multiplication into\naddition, which is a lot simpler. They are the basis for slide rules (not so important)\nand for graphs on log paper (very important). Logarithms are mirror images of\nexponentials--and those I know you have met.\nStart with exponentials. The numbers 10 and 102 and 103 are basic to the decimal\nsystem. For completeness I also include 100; which is \"ten to the zeroth power\" or\n1: The logarithms of those numbers are the exponents. The logarithms of 1 and\n10 and 100 and 1000 are 0 and 1 and 2 and 3: These are logarithms \"to base 10,\"\nbecause the powers are powers of 10:\nQuestion When the base changes from 10 to b, what is the logarithm of 1 ?\nAnswer\nSince b0 D 1, log b 1 is always zero. To base b, the logarithm of bn is n:\nNegative powers are also needed. The number 10x is positive, but its exponent x can\nbe negative. The first examples are 1=10 and 1=100, which are the same as 10\n1 and\n2: The logarithms are the exponents\n1 and\n2:\n1000D103\nand\nlog 1000D3\n1=1000D10\nand\nlog 1=1000D\n3:\nMultiplying 1000 times 1=1000 gives 1 D 100: Adding logarithms gives 3C. 3/ D\n0: Always 10m times 10n equals 10mCn: In particular 103 times 102 produces five\ntens:\n.10/.10/.10/ times .10/.10/ equals .10/.10/.10/.10/.10/ D 105:\nThe law for bm times bn extends to all exponents, as in 104:6 times 10: Furthermore\nthe law applies to all bases (we restrict the base to b\n¡ 0 and b ¤ 1). In every case\nmultiplication of numbers is addition of exponents.\n6A\nbm times bn equals bmCn, so logarithms (exponents) add\nbm divided by bn equals bm n, so logarithms (exponents) subtract\nlogb.yz/ D logb y Clog b z\nand\nlog b.y=z/ D logb y\nlogb z:\n(1)\nHistorical note In the days of slide rules, 1:2 and 1:3 were multiplied by sliding\none edge across to 1:2 and reading the answer under 1:3: A slide rule made in\nGermany would give the third digit in 1:56: Its photograph shows the numbers on a\nlog scale. The distance from 1 to 2 equals the distance from 2 to 4 and from 4 to 8:\nBy sliding the edges, you add distances and multiply numbers.\nDivision goes the other way. Notice how 1000=10 D 100 matches 3\n1 D 2: To\ndivide 1:56 by 1:3, look back along line D for the answer 1:2:\nThe second figure, though smaller, is the important one. When x increases by\n1;2x is multiplied by 2. Adding to x multiplies y: This rule easily gives y D 1;2;4;8;\nbut look ahead to calculus--which doesn't stay with whole numbers.\nCalculus will add x: Then y is multiplied by 2x: This number is near 1:\nIf x D 1\n10 then 2x\n1:07--the tenth root of 2: To find the slope, we have to\nconsider .2x\n1/=x. The limit is near .1:07\n1/= 1\n10 D :7, but the exact number\nwill take time.\n\n6.1\nAn Overview\nFig. 6.1\nAn ancient relic (the slide rule). When exponents x add, powers 2x multiply.\nBase Change Bases other than 10 and exponents other than 1;2;3;::: are needed\nfor applications. The population of the world x years from now is predicted to grow by\na factor close to 1:02x: Certainly x does not need to be a whole number of years. And\ncertainly the base 1:02 should not be 10 (or we are in real trouble). This prediction\nwill be refined as we study the differential equations for growth. It can be rewritten to\nbase 10 if that is preferred (but look at the exponent):\n1:02x\nis the same as\n10.log 1:02/x:\nWhen the base changes from 1:02 to 10, the exponent is multiplied--as we now see.\nFor practice, start with base b and change to base a: The logarithm to base a will\nbe written \"log:\" Everything comes from the rule that logarithmD exponent:\nbase change for numbers W\nb D alog b:\nNow raise both sides to the power x: You see the change in the exponent:\nbase change for exponentials W\nbx D a.log b/x:\nFinally set y D bx: Its logarithm to base b is x: Its logarithm to base a is the exponent\non the right hand side: loga y D .loga b/x: Now replace x by logb y:\nbase change for logarithms W\nloga y D .loga b/.logb y/:\nWe absolutely need this ability to change the base. An example with a D 2 is\nb D 8 D 23\n82 D .23/2 D 26\nlog2 64 D 3\n2 D .log2 8/.log8 64/:\nThe rule behind base changes is .am/x D amx: When the mth power is raised\nto the xth power, the exponents multiply. The square of the cube is the sixth power:\n.a/.a/.a/ times .a/.a/.a/ equals .a/.a/.a/.a/.a/.a/ W\n.a3/2 D a6:\nAnother base will soon be more important than 10--here are the rules for base changes:\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\n6B To change numbers, powers, and logarithms from base b to base a, use\nb D aloga b\nbx D a.loga b/x\nloga y D .loga b/.logb y/\n(2)\nThe first is the definition. The second is the xth power of the first. The third is the\nlogarithm of the second (remember y is bx). An important case is y D a:\nloga a D .loga b/.logb a/ D 1 so loga b D 1=logb a:\n(3)\nEXAMPLE 8 D 23 means 81=3 D 2: Then .log2 8/.log8 2/ D .3/.1=3/ D 1:\nThis completes the algebra of logarithms. The addition rules 6A came from\n.bm/.bn/ D bmCn: The multiplication rule 6B came from .am/x D amx: We still\nneed to define bx and ax for all real numbers x. When x is a fraction, the defi-\nnition is easy. The square root of a8 is a4.m D 8 times x D 1=2/: When x is not a\nfraction, as in 2; the graph suggests one way to fill in the hole.\nWe could define 2 as the limit of 23;231=10;2314=100; :::: As the fractions\nr approach , the powers 2r approach 2: This makes y D 2x into a continuous\nfunction, with the desired properties .2m/.2n/ D 2mCn and .2m/x D 2mx--whether\nm and n and x are integers or not. But the \"'s and ı's of continuity are not attractive,\nand we eventually choose (in Section 6:4) a smoother approach based on integrals.\nGRAPHS OF bx AND logb y\nIt is time to draw graphs. In principle one graph should do the job for both functions,\nbecause y D bx means the same as x D logb y: These are inverse functions. What\none function does, its inverse undoes. The logarithm of g.x/ D bx is x:\ng\n1.g.x// D logb.bx/ D x:\n(4)\nIn the opposite direction, the exponential of the logarithm of y is y:\ng.g\n1.y// D b.logb y/ D y:\n(5)\nThis holds for every base b, and it is valuable to see b D 2 and b D 4 on the same\ngraph. Figure 6.2a shows y D 2x and y D 4x: Their mirror images in the 45\nline\ngive the logarithms to base 2 and base 4, which are in the right graph.\nWhen x is negative, y D bx is still positive. If the first graph is extended to the\nleft, it stays above the x axis. Sketch it in with your pencil. Also extend the second\ngraph down, to be the mirror image. Don't cross the vertical axis.\nFig. 6.2\nExponentials and mirror images (logarithms). Different scales for x and y:\n\n6.1\nAn Overview\nThere are interesting relations within the left figure. All exponentials start at 1,\nbecause b0 is always 1: At the height y D 16, one graph is above x D 2 (because\n42 D 16). The other graph is above x D 4 (because 24 D 16). Why does 4x in one\ngraph equal 22x in the other ? This is the base change for powers, since 4 D 22:\nThe figure on the right shows the mirror image--the logarithm. All logarithms\nstart from zero at y D 1: The graphs go down to\n8 at y D 0: (Roughly speaking\n8 is zero.) Again x in one graph corresponds to 2x in the other (base change for\nlogarithms). Both logarithms climb slowly, since the exponentials climb so fast.\nThe number log2 10 is between 3 and 4, because 10 is between 23 and 24: The\nslope of 2x is proportional to 2x--which never happened for xn: But there are two\npractical difficulties with those graphs:\n1. 2x and 4x increase too fast. The curves turn virtually straight up.\n2. The most important fact about Abx is the value of b--and the base\ndoesn't stand out in the graph.\nThere is also another point. In many problems we don't know the function y D f .x/:\nWe are looking for it! All we have are measured values of y (with errors mixed in).\nWhen the values are plotted on a graph, we want to discover f .x/:\nFortunately there is a solution. Scale the y axis differently. On ordinary graphs,\neach unit upward adds a fixed amount to y: On a log scale each unit multiplies y\nby a fixed amount. The step from y D 1 to y D 2 is the same length as the step from\n3 to 6 or 10 to 20:\nOn a log scale, y D 11 is not halfway between 10 and 12: And y D 0 is not there\nat all. Each step down divides by a fixed amount--we never reach zero. This is\ncompletely satisfactory for Abx, which also never reaches zero.\nFigure 6.3 is on semilog paper (also known as log-linear), with an ordinary x\naxis. The graph of y D Abx is a straight line. To see why, take logarithms of that\nequation:\nlog y D log ACx log b:\n(6)\nThe relation between x and log y is linear. It is really log y that is plotted, so the\ngraph is straight. The markings on the y axis allow you to enter y without looking up\nits logarithm--you get an ordinary graph of log y against x:\nFigure 6.3 shows two examples. One graph is an exact plot of y D 2\n10x: It goes\nupward with slope 1; because a unit across has the same length as multiplication by\n10 going up. 10x has slope 1 and 10.log b/x (which is bx) will have slope log b.\nThe crucial number log b can be measured directly as the slope.\nThe second graph in Figure 6.3 is more typical of actual practice, in which we start\nwith measurements and look for f .x/: Here are the data points:\nx D0:0\n0:2\n0:4\n0:6\n0:8\n1:0\ny D4:0\n3:2\n2:4\n2:0\n1:6\n1:3\nWe don't know in advance whether these values fit the model y D Abx: The graph\nis strong evidence that they do. The points lie close to a line with negative slope--\nindicating log b\n0 and b\n1: The slope down is half of the earlier slope up, so the\nmodel is consistent with\ny D A\nx=2\nor\nlog y D log A\n2x:\n(7)\nWhen x reaches 2, y drops by a factor of 10: At x D 0 we see A\n4:\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nFig. 6.3\n10x and 4\nx=2 on semilog paper.\nFig. 6.4\nGraphs of Axk on log-log paper.\nAnother model--a power y D Axk instead of an exponential--also stands out with\nlogarithmic scaling. This time we use log-log paper, with both axes scaled. The\nlogarithm of y D Axk gives a linear relation between log y and log x:\nlog y D log ACk log x:\n(8)\nThe exponent k becomes the slope on log-log paper. The base b makes no\ndifference. We just measure the slope, and a straight line is a lot more attractive\nthan a power curve.\nThe graphs in Figure 6.4 have slopes 3 and 1\n2 and\n1: They represent Ax3 and\nA\n?x and A=x: To find the A's, look at one point on the line. At x D 4 the height is\n8; so adjust the A's to make this happen: The functions are x3=8 and 4\n?x and 32=x:\nOn semilog paper those graphs would not be straight!\nYou can buy log paper or create it with computer graphics.\nTHE DERIVATIVES OF y D bx AND x D logb y\nThis is a calculus book. We have to ask about slopes. The algebra of exponents is\ndone, the rules are set, and on log paper the graphs are straight. Now come limits.\nThe central question is the derivative. What is dy=dx when y D bx ? What is\ndx=dy when x is the logarithm logb y ? Those questions are closely related, be-\ncause bx and logb y are inverse functions. If one slope can be found, the other is\nknown from dx=dy D 1=.dy=dx/: The problem is to find one of them, and the ex-\nponential comes first.\nYou will now see that those questions have quick (and beautiful) answers, except\nfor a mysterious constant. There is a multiplying factor c which needs more time.\n\n6.1\nAn Overview\nI think it is worth separating out the part that can be done immediately, leaving c\nin dy=dx and 1=c in dx=dy: Then Section 6:2 discovers c by studying the special\nnumber called e (but c ¤ e).\n6C The derivative of bx is a multiple cbx: The number c depends on the base b:\nThe product and power and chain rules do not yield this derivative. We are pushed all\nthe way back to the original definition, the limit of y=x:\ndy\ndx D lim\nhN0\ny.x Ch/\ny.x/\nh\nD lim\nhN0\nbxCh\nbx\nh\n:\n(9)\nKey idea: Split bxCh into bx times bh: Then the crucial quantity bx factors out.\nMore than that, bx comes outside the limit because it does not depend on h: The\nremaining limit, inside the brackets, is the number c that we don't yet know:\ndy\ndx D lim\nhN0\nbxbh\nbx\nh\nD bx\n\"\nlim\nhN0\nbh\nh\n#\nD cbx:\n(10)\nThis equation is central to the whole chapter:dy=dx equals cbx which equals cy:\nThe rate of change of y is proportional to y. The slope increases in the same way\nthat bx increases (except for the factor c). A typical example is money in a bank,\nwhere interest is proportional to the principal. The rich get richer, and the poor get\nslightly richer. We will come back to compound interest, and identify b and c:\nThe inverse function is x D logb y: Now the unknown factor is 1=c:\n6D The slope of logb y is 1=cy with the same c (depending on b).\nProof\nIf dy=dx D cbx then dx=dy D 1=cbx D 1=cy:\n(11)\nThat proof was like a Russian toast, powerful but too quick!

I have never met a logarithm to base 6 or 9:3: Realistically there are two\nleading candidates for b, and 10 is one of them. This section is about the other one,\nwhich is an extremely remarkable number. This number is not seen in arithmetic or\nalgebra or geometry, where it looks totally clumsy and out of place. In calculus it\ncomes into its own.\nThe number is e: That symbol was chosen by Euler (initially in a fit of selfishness,\nbut he was a wonderful mathematician). It is the base of the natural logarithm. It\nalso controls the exponential ex, which is much more important than ln x: Euler also\nchose to stand for perimeter--anyway, our first goal is to find e:\nRemember that the derivatives of bx and logb y include a constant c that depends\non b: Equations (10) and (11) in the previous section were\nd\ndx bx D cbx\nand\nd\ndy logb y D 1\ncy :\n(1)\nAt x D 0, the graph of bx starts from b0 D 1: The slope is c: At y D 1, the graph of\nlogb y starts from logb 1 D 0: The logarithm has slope 1=c: With the right choice\nof the base b those slopes will equal 1 (because c will equal 1).\nFor y D 2x the slope c is near :7: We already tried x D :1 and found y\n:07:\nThe base has to be larger than 2; for a starting slope of c D 1:\nWe begin with a direct computation of the slope of logb y at y D 1:\nc D slope at 1 D lim\nhN0\nh\nh\nlogb.1Ch/\nlogb 1\ni\nD lim\nhN0logb\nh\n.1Ch/1=hi\n:\n(2)\nAlways logb 1 D 0: The fraction in the middle is logb.1Ch/ times the number 1=h:\nThis number can go up into the exponent, and it did.\nThe quantity .1Ch/1=h is unusual, to put it mildly. As h\nN 0, the number 1Ch\nis approaching 1: At the same time, 1=h is approaching infinity. In the limit we\nhave 1\n8: But that expression is meaningless (like 0=0). Everything depends on the\nbalance between \"nearly 1\" and \"nearly\n8:\" This balance produces the extraordinary\nnumber e:\nDEFINITION\nThe number e is equal to lim\nhN0.1Ch/1=h: Equivalently\ne D lim\nhN0\n\n1C 1\nn\nn\n:\nBefore computing e, look again at the slope 1=c: At the end of equation (2) is the\nlogarithm of e:\n1=c D logb e:\n(3)\nWhen the base is b D e; the slope is loge e D 1: That base e has c D 1 as desired:\nThe derivative of ex is 1\nex and the derivative of log e y is\ny :\n(4)\nThis is why the base e is all-important in calculus. It makes c D 1:\nTo compute the actual number e from .1Ch/1=h, choose h D 1;1=10;1=100; ::::\nThen the exponents 1=h are n D 1;10;100; :::: (All limits and derivatives will\nbecome official in Section 6:4:) The table shows .1Ch/1=h approaching e as\nh\nN 0 and n\nN\n8:\n\n6.2\nThe Exponential ex\nn\nh D 1\nn\n1Ch D 1C 1\nn\n.1Ch/1=h D\n\n1C 1\nn\nn\n1:0\n2:0\n2:0\n0:5\n1:5\n2:25\n0:1\n1:1\n2:593742\n0:01\n1:01\n2:704814\n0:001\n1:001\n2:716924\n0:0001\n1:0001\n2:718146\nThe last column is converging to e (not quickly). There is an infinite series that\nconverges much faster. We know 125;000 digits of e (and a billion digits of ).

The logarithms of 150 and 10; to the base\ne, are close to x D 5 and x D 2:3: There is a special name for this logarithm--the\nnatural logarithm. There is also a special notation \"ln\" to show that the base is e:\nln y means the same as loge y:The natural logarithm is the exponent in ex D y:\nThe notation ln y (or ln x--it is the function that matters, not the variable) is standard\nin calculus courses. After calculus, the base is generally assumed to be e: In most of\nscience and engineering, the natural logarithm is the automatic choice. The symbol\n\"exp .x/\" means ex, and the truth is that the symbol \"log x\" generally means ln x:\nBase e is understood even without the letters ln: But in any case of doubt--on a\ncalculator key for example--the symbol \"ln x\" emphasizes that the base is e:\nTHE DERIVATIVES OF ex AND ln x\nCome back to derivatives and slopes. The derivative of bx is cbx; and the derivative\nof logb y is 1=cy: If b D e then c D 1. For all bases, equation (3) is 1=c D logb e:\nThis gives c--the slope of bx at x D 0:\n6E The number c is 1=logb e D log e b: Thus c equals ln b.\n(5)\nc D ln b is the mysterious constant that was not available earlier. The slope of\n2x is ln 2 times 2x: The slope of ex is ln e times ex (but ln e D 1). We have the\nderivatives on which this chapter depends:\n6F The derivatives of ex and ln y are ex and 1=y: For other bases\nd\ndx bx D .ln b/bx\nand\nd\ndy logb y D\n.ln b/y :\n(6)\nTo make clear that those derivatives come from the functions (and not at all from the\ndummy variables), we rewrite them using t and x:\nd\ndt et D et\nand\nd\ndx ln x D 1\nx :\n(7)\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nRemark on slopes at x D 0: It would be satisfying to see directly that the slope\nof 2x is below 1; and the slope of 4x is above 1: Quick proof: e is between 2 and 4.\nBut the idea is to see the slopes graphically. This is a small puzzle, which is fun to\nsolve but can be skipped.\n2x rises from 1 at x D 0 to 2 at x D 1: On that interval its average slope is 1: Its\nslope at the beginning is smaller than average, so it must be less than 1--as desired.\nOn the other hand 4x rises from 1\n2 at x D\n2 to 1 at x D 0: Again the average slope\nis 1\nı 1\n2 D 1: Since x D 0 comes at the end of this new interval, the slope of 4x at that\npoint exceeds 1: Somewhere between 2x and 4x is ex, which starts out with slope 1:\nThis is the graphical approach to e: There is also the infinite series, and a fifth\ndefinition through integrals which is written here for the record:\n1. e is the number such that ex has slope 1 at x D 0\n2. e is the base for which ln y D loge y has slope 1 at y D 1\n3. e is the limit of\n\n1C 1\nn\nn\nas n\nN\n4. e D 1\n0S C 1\n1S C 1\n2S C 1\n3S C\n\nD 1C1C 1\n2 C 1\n6 C\n\n5. the area\nr e\n1x\n1dx equals 1:\nThe connections between 1, 2, and 3 have been made. The slopes are 1 when e is\nthe limit of .1C1=n/n: Multiplying this out wlll lead to 4, the infinite series in\nSection 6.6. The official definition of ln x comes from\nr\ndx=x, and then 5 says that\nln e D 1: This approach to e (Section 6.4) seems less intuitive than the others.\nFigure 6.6b shows the graph of e\nx: It is the mirror image of ex across the\nvertical axis. Their product is exe\nx D 1: Where ex grows exponentially, e\nx\ndecays exponentially--or it grows as x approaches\n8: Their growth and decay\nare faster than any power of x. Exponential growth is more rapid than polynomial\ngrowth, so that ex=xn goes to infinity (Problem 59). It is the fact that ex has slope\nex which keeps the function climbing so fast.\nFig. 6.6\nex grows between 2x and 4x: Decay of e\nx; faster decay of e\nx2=2:\nThe other curve is y D e\nx2=2: This is the famous \"bell-shaped curve\" of\nprobability theory. After dividing by\n?\n2, it gives the normal distribution, which\napplies to so many averages and so many experiments. The Gallup Poll will be an\nexample in Section 8.4. The curve is symmetric around its mean value x D 0, since\nchanging x to\nx has no effect on x2:\nAbout two thirds of the area under this curve is between x D\n1 and x D 1: If\nyou pick points at random below the graph, 2=3 of all samples are expected in that\ninterval. The points x D\n2 and x D 2 are \"two standard deviations\" from the center,\nenclosing 95% of the area. There is only a 5% chance of landing beyond. The decay\nis even faster than an ordinary exponential, because 1\n2x2 has replaced x:\n\n6.2\nThe Exponential ex\nTHE DERIVATIVES OF ecx AND eu.x/\nThe slope of ex is ex: This opens up a whole world of functions that calculus can\ndeal with.

The result was y\n1 D cecx; which\nmeans that y\n1 D cy. That computation brought others with it, virtually for free--the\nderivatives of bx and xx and eu.x/: But I want to stay with y\n1 D cy--which is the\nmost important differential equation in applied mathematics.\nCompare y\n1 D x with y\n1 D y. The first only asks for an antiderivative of x: We\nquickly find y D 1\n2x2 CC: The second has dy=dx equal to y itself--which we rewrite\nas dy=y D dx: The integral is in y D x CC: Then y itself is exec: Notice that the\nfirst solution is 1\n2x2 plus a constant, and the second solution is ex times a constant.\nThere is a way to graph slope x versus slope y: Figure 6.7 shows \"tangent arrows,\"\nwhich give the slope at each x and y: For parabolas, the arrows grow steeper as\nx grows--because y\n1 D slope D x: For exponentials, the arrows grow steeper as y\ngrows--the equation is y\n1 D slope D y: Now the arrows are connected by y D Aex:\nA differential equation gives a field of arrows (slopes). Its solution is a curve that\nstays tangent to the arrows--then the curve has the right slope.\nFig. 6.7\nThe slopes are y\n1 D x and y\n1 D y: The solution curves fit those slopes.\nA field of arrows can show many solutions at once (this comes in a differential\nequations course). Usually a single y0 is not sacred. To understand the equation we\nstart from many y0--on the left the parabolas stay parallel, on the right the heights\nstay proportional. For y\n1 D\ny all solution curves go to zero.\nFrom y\n1 D y it is a short step to y\n1 D cy: To make c appear in the derivative, put\nc into the exponent. The derivative of y D ecx is cecx; which is c times y: We have\nreached the key equation, which comes with an initial condition--a starting value\ny0:\ndy=dt D cy with y D y0 at t D 0:\n(1)\nA small change: x has switched to t: In most applications time is the natural variable,\nrather than space. The factor c becomes the \"growth rate\" or \"decay rate\"--and ecx\nconverts to ect:\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nThe last step is to match the initial condition. The problem requires y D y0 at\nt D 0: Our ect starts from ec0 D 1: The constant of integration is needed now--the\nsolutions are y D Aect: By choosing A D y0, we match the initial condition and\nsolve equation (1). The formula to remember is y0ect:\n6I The exponential law y D y0ect solves y\n1 D cy starting from y0:\nThe rate of growth or decay is c: May I call your attention to a basic fact ? The\nformula y0ect contains three quantities y0;c;t: If two of them are given, plus one\nadditional piece of information, the third is determined. Many applications have one\nof these three forms: find t, find c, find y0:\n1. Find the doubling time T if c D 1=10: At that time y0ecT equals 2y0:\necT D 2 yields cT D ln 2 so that T D ln 2\nc\n:7\n:1:\n(2)\nThe question asks for an exponent T: The answer involves logarithms. If a cell\ngrows at a continuous rate of c D 10% per day, it takes about :7=:1 D 7 days to\ndouble in size. (Note that :7 is close to ln 2:) If a savings account earns 10%\ncontinuous interest, it doubles in 7 years.\nIn this problem we knew c: In the next problem we know T:\n2. Find the decay constant c for carbon-14 if y D 1\n2y0 in T D 5568 years.\necT D 1\n2 yields cT D ln 1\n2 so that c\n\nln 1\n\n=5568:\n(3)\nAfter the half-life T D 5568, the factor ecT equals 1\n2: Now c is negative .ln 1\n2 D\nln 2/:\nQuestion 1 was about growth. Question 2 was about decay. Both answers found\necT as the ratio y.T /=y.0/: Then cT is its logarithm. Note how c sticks to T:\nT has the units of time, c has the units of \"1=time:\"\nMain point: The doubling time is .ln 2/=c, because cT D ln 2: The time to multi-\nply by e is 1=c: The time to multiply by 10 is .ln 10/=c: The time to divide by e is\n1=c, when a negative c brings decay.\n3. Find the initial value y0 if c D 2 and y.1/ D 5:\ny.t/ D y0ect yields y0 D y.t/e\nct D 5e\n2:\nFig. 6.8\nGrowth (c\n¡ 0) and decay (c\n0). Doubling time T D .ln 2/=c: Future value at 5%:\n\n6.3\nGrowth and Decay in Science and Economics\nAll we do is run the process backward. Start from 5 and go back to y0: With time\nreversed, ect becomes e\nct: The product of e2 and e\n2 is 1--growth forward and\ndecay backward.\nEqually important is T Ct: Go forward to time T and go on to T Ct:\ny.T Ct/ is y0ec.T Ct/ which is .y0ecT /ect:\n(4)\nEver step t; at the start or later, multiplies by the same ect: This uses the fundamental\nproperty of exponentials, that eT Ct D eT et:\nEXAMPLE 1\nPopulation growth from birth rate b and death rate d (both\nconstant):\ndy=dt D by\ndy D cy\n.the net rate is c D b\nd/:\nThe population in this model is y0ect D y0ebte\ndt: It grows when b\n¡ d (which\nmakes c\n¡ 0). One estimate of the growth rate is c D 0:02=year:\nThe earth's population doubles in about T D ln 2\nc\n:7\n:02 D 35 years:\nFirst comment: We predict the future based on c: We count the past population to\nfind c: Changes in c are a serious problem for this model.\nSecond comment: y0ect is not a whole number. You may prefer to think of bacteria\ninstead of people. (This section begins a major application of mathematics to\neconomics and the life sciences.) Malthus based his theory of human population\non this equation y\n1 D cy--and with large numbers a fraction of a person doesn't\nmatter so much. To use calculus we go from discrete to continuous. The theory\nmust fail when t is very large, since populations cannot grow exponentially forever.\nSection 6.5 introduces the logistic equation y\n1 D cy\nby2, with a competition term\nby2 to slow the growth.\nThird comment: The dimensions of b;c;d are \"1=time.\" The dictionary gives birth\nrate D number of births per person in a unit of time. It is a relative rate--people\ndivided by people and time. The product ct is dimensionless and ect makes sense\n(also dimensionless). Some texts replace c by (lambda). Then 1= is the growth\ntime or decay time or drug elimination time or diffusion time.\nEXAMPLE 2\nRadioactive dating\nA gram of charcoal from the cave paintings in\nFrance gives 0:97 disintegrations per minute. A gram of living wood gives 6:68\ndisintegrations per minute. Find the age of those Lascaux paintings.\nThe charcoal stopped adding radiocarbon when it was burned (at t D 0). The\namount has decayed to y0ect: In living wood this amount is still y0; because cosmic\nrays maintain the balance. Their ratio is ect D 0:97=6:68.

For the\nprice change y over a year, use the annual rate:\ny D .annual rate/ times .y/ times .t/:\n(5)\nCalculus applies the continuous rate to each instant dt: The price change is dy:\ndy D .continuous rate/ times .y/ times .dt/:\n(6)\nDividing by dt, this is a differential equation for the price:\ndy=dt D .continuous rate/ times .y/ D :05y:\nThe solution is y0e:05t: Set t D 1: Then e:05\n1:0513 and the annual rate is 5:13%:\nWhen you ask a bank what interest they pay, they give both rates: 8% and 8:33%:\nThe higher one they call the \"effective rate.\" It comes from compounding (and\ndepends how often they do it). If the compounding is continuous, every dt brings\nan increase of dy--and e:08 is near 1:0833:\nSection 6.6 returns to compound interest. The interval drops from a month to a day\nto a second. That leads to .1C1=n/n, and in the limit to e: Here we compute the\neffect of 5% continuous interest:\nFuture value\nA dollar now has the same value as e:05T dollars in T years.\nPresent value\nA dollar in T years has the same value as e\n:05T dollars now.\nDoubling time\nPrices double .e:05T D 2/ in T D ln 2=:05\n14 years.\nWith no compounding, the doubling time is 20 years. Simple interest adds on 20\ntimes 5% D 100%: With continuous compounding the time is reduced by the factor\nln 2\n:7, regardless of the interest rate.\nEXAMPLE 4\nIn 1626 the Indians sold Manhattan for $24: Our calculations in-\ndicate that they knew what they were doing. Assuming 8% compound interest, the\noriginal $24 is multiplied by e:08t: After t D 365 years the multiplier is e29:2 and the\n$24 has grown to 115 trillion dollars. With that much money they could buy back the\nland and pay off the national debt.\nThis seems farfetched. Possibly there is a big flaw in the model. It is absolutely\ntrue that Ben Franklin left money to Boston and Philadelphia, to be invested for 200\nyears. In 1990 it yielded millions (not trillions, that takes longer). Our next step is a\nnew model.\nQuestion How can you estimate e29:2 with a $24 calculator (log but not ln) ?\nAnswer\nMultiply 29:2 by log10 e D :434 to get 12:7: This is the exponent to base\n10. After that base change, we have 1012:7 or more than a trillion.\nGROWTH OR DECAY WITH A SOURCE TERM\nThe equation y\n1 D y will be given a new term. Up to now, all growth or decay has\nstarted from y0: No deposit or withdrawal was made later. The investment grew by\nitself--a pure exponential. The new term s allows you to add or subtract from the\n\n6.3\nGrowth and Decay in Science and Economics\naccount. It is a \"source\"--or a \"sink\" if s is negative. The source s D 5 adds 5dt,\nproportional to dt but not to y:\nConstant source:\ndy=dt D y C5 starting from y D y0:\nNotice y on both sides! My first guess y D etC5 failed completely. Its derivative is\netC5 again, which is not y C5: The class suggested y D et C5t: But its derivative\net C5 is still not y C5: We tried other ways to produce 5 in dy=dt: This idea is\ndoomed to failure. Finally we thought of y D Aet\n5. That has y\n1 D Aet D y C5\nas required.\nImportant: A is not y0. Set t D 0 to find y0 D A\n5: The source contributes 5et\n\n5:\nThe solution is .y0 C5/et\n5: That is the same as y0et C5.et\n1/:\ns D 5 multiplies the growth term et\n1 that starts at zero. y0et grows as before.\nEXAMPLE 5\ndy=dt D\ny C5 has y D .y0\n5/e\nt C5: This is y0e\nt C5.1\ne\nt/:\nThat final term from the source is still positive. The other term y0e\nt decays to zero.\nThe limit as t\nN\n8 is y\n8 D 5. A negative c leads to a steady state y\n8:\nBased on these examples with c D 1 and c D\n1, we can find y for any c and s.\nEQUATION WITH SOURCE\ndy\ndt D cy Cs starts from y D y0 at t D 0:(7)\nThe source could be a deposit of s D $1000=year, after an initial investment of y0 D\n$8000: Or we can withdraw funds at s D\n$200=year. The units are \"dollars per\nyear\" to match dy=dt: The equation feeds in $1000 or removes$200 continuously--\nnot all at once.\nNote again that y D e.cCs/t is not a solution. Its derivative is .c Cs/y: The com-\nbination y D ect Cs is also not a solution (but closer). The analysis of y\n1 D cy Cs\nwill be our main achievement for differential equations (in this section). The\nequation is not restricted to finance--far from it--but that produces excellent exam-\nples.\nFig. 6.9\nI propose to find y in four ways. You may feel that one way is enough. The first\nway is the fastest--only three lines--but please give the others a chance. There is no\npoint in preparing for real problems if we don't solve them.\nSolution by Method 1 (fast way) Substitute the combination y D Aect CB: The\nsolution has this form--exponential plus constant. From two facts we find A and\nB:\nthe equation y\n1 D cy Cs gives cAect D c.Aect CB/Cs\nthe initial value at t D 0 gives ACB D y0:\nThe first line has cAect on both sides. Subtraction leaves cB Cs D 0, or B D\ns=c:\nThen the second line becomes A D y0\nB D y0 C.s=c/:\nKEY FORMULA\ny D\n\ny0 C s\nc\n\nect\ns\nc\nor\ny D y0ect C s\nc\nect\n\n:\n(8)\nWith s D 0 this is the old solution y0ect (no source). The example with c D 1 and\ns D 5 produced .y0C5/et\n5: Separating the source term gives y0et C5.et\n1/:\nMy class says one way is more than enough. They just want the answer. Sometimes I cave\nin and write down the formula: y is y0ect plus s.ect\n1/=c from the source term.\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nSolution by Method 2 (slow way) The input y0 produces the output y0ect: After t\nyears any deposit is multiplied by ect: That also applies to deposits made after the\naccount is opened. If the deposit enters at time T , the growing time is only t\nT:\nTherefore the multiplying factor is only ec.t\nT /: This growth factor applies to the\nsmall deposit (amount sdT ) made between time T and T CdT:\nNow add up all outputs at time t: The output from y0 is y0ect: The small deposit\nsdT near time T grows to ec.t\nT /sdT: The total is an integral:\ny.t/ D y0ect C\n» t\nT D0\nec.t\nT /sdT:\n(9)\nThis principle of Duhamel would still apply when the source s varies with time.\nHere s is constant, and the integral divides by c:\ns\n» t\nT D0\nec.t\nT /dT D sec.t\nT /\nc\n#t\nD\ns\nc C s\nc ect:\n(10)\nThat agrees with the source term from Method 1; at the end of equation (8). There we\nlooked for \"exponential plus constant,\" here we added up outputs.\nMethod 1 was easier. It succeeded because we knew the form Aect CB--with\n\"undetermined coefficients.\" Method 2 is more complete. The form for y is part of the\noutput, not the input. The source s is a continuous supply of new deposits, all growing\nseparately. Section 6:5 starts from scratch, by directly integrating y\n1 D cy Cs:\nRemark\nMethod 2 is often described in terms of an integrating factor. First write\nthe equation as y\ncy D s: Then multiply by a magic factor that makes integration\npossible:\n.y\ncy/e\nct Dse\nct\nmultiply by the factor e\nct\nye\nctit\n0 D\ns\nc e\nctit\nintegrate both sides\nye\nct\ny0 D\ns\nc .e\nct\n1/\nsubstitute 0 and t\ny Decty0 C s\nc .ect\n1/\nisolate y to reach formula (8)\nThe integrating factor produced a perfect derivative in line 1: I prefer Duhamel's idea,\nthat all inputs y0 and s grow the same way. Either method gives formula (8) for y:\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF FINANCE (AT A CONTINUOUS RATE)\nThe question from finance is this: What inputs give what outputs ? The inputs can\ncome at the start by y0, or continuously by s: The output can be paid at the end or\ncontinuously. There are six basic questions, two of which are already answered.\nThe future value is y0ect from a deposit of y0: To produce y in the future,\ndeposit the present value ye\nct: Questions 3-6 involve the source term s. We fix\nthe continuous rate at 5% per year .c D :05/, and start the account from y0 D 0: The\nanswers come fast from equation (8).\nQuestion 3\nWith deposits of s D $1000=year; how large is y after 20 years ?\ny D s\nc .ect\n1/ D 1000\n:05 .e.:05/.20/\n1/ D 20;000.e\n1/\n$34;400:\nOne big deposit yields 20;000e\n$54;000: The same 20;000 via s yields $34;400:\n\n6.3\nGrowth and Decay in Science and Economics\nNotice a small by-product (for mathematicians). When the interest rate is c D 0,\nour formula s.ect\n1/=c turns into 0=0: We are absolutely sure that depositing\n$1000=year with no interest produces $20;000 after 20 years. But this is not obvious\nfrom 0=0: By l'Hopital's rule we take c-derivatives in the fraction:\nlim\nc\nN0\ns.ect\n1/\nc\nD lim\nc\nN0\nstect\nD st: This is .1000/.20/ D 20;000:\n(11)\nQuestion 4\nWhat continuous deposit of s per year yields $20;000 after 20 years ?\n20;000 D s\n:05 .e.:05/.20/\n1/ requires s D 1000\ne\n582:\nDeposits of $582 over 20 years total $11;640: A single deposit of y0 D 20;000=e D\n$7;360 produces the same $20;000 at the end. Better to be rich at t D 0:\nQuestions 1 and 2 had s D 0 (no source). Questions 3 and 4 had y0 D 0 (no initial\ndeposit). Now we come to y D 0: In 5, everything is paid out by an annuity. In 6,\neverything is paid up on a loan.\nQuestion 5\nWhat deposit y0 provides $1000=year for 20 years ? End with y D 0:\ny D y0ect C s\nc .ect\n1/ D 0 requires y0 D\ns\nc .1\ne\nct/:\nSubstituting s D\n1000; c D :05; t D 20 gives y0\n12;640: If you win $20;000 in\na lottery, and it is paid over 20 years, the lottery only has to put in $12;640: Even\nless if the interest rate is above 5%:\nQuestion 6\nWhat payments s will clear a loan of y0 D $20;000 in 20 years ?\nUnfortunately, s exceeds $1000 per year. The bank gives up more than the $20,000\nto buy your car (and pay tuition). It also gives up the interest on that money. You\npay that back too, but you don't have to stay even at every moment. Instead you repay\nat a constant rate for 20 years. Your payments mostly cover interest at the start and\nprincipal at the end. After t D 20 years you are even and your debt is y D 0:\nThis is like Question 5 (also y D 0), but now we know y0 and we want s:\ny D y0ect C s\nc .ect\n1/ D 0 requires s D\ncy0ect=.ect\n1/:\nThe loan is y0 D $20;000, the rate is c D :05=year; the time is t D 20 years.\nSubstituting in the formula for s, your payments are $1582 per year.\nPuzzle How is s D $1582 for loan payments related to s D $582 for deposits ?\nN $582 per year\nN $20;000\nand\n$20;000\nN\n$1582 per year\nN 0:\nThat difference of exactly 1000 cannot be an accident. 1582 and 582 came from\ne\ne\n1 and 1000\ne\n1 with difference 1000e\ne\n1 D 1000:\nWhy ? Here is the real reason. Instead of repaying 1582 we can pay only 1000 (to\nkeep even with the interest on 20;000). The other 582 goes into a separate account.\nAfter 20 years the continuous 582 has built up to 20;000 (including interest as in\nQuestion 4). From that account we pay back the loan.\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nSection 6.6 deals with daily compounding--which differs from continuous\ncompounding by only a few cents.

That is the \"transient\" term, which disappears as t\nN\n8: What is left is the\n\"steady state.\" We denote that limit by y\n8:\nWithout a source, y\n8 is zero (total decay).

But logarithms have one important theoretical advantage (plus\nmany applications of their own). The advantage is that the derivative of ln x is 1=x;\nwhereas the derivative of ex is ex: We can't define ex as its own integral, without\ncircular reasoning. But we can and do define ln x (the natural logarithm) as the\nintegral of the \"1 power\" which is 1=x:\nln x D\n» x\nx dx\nor\nln y D\n» y\nu du:\n(1)\nNote the dummy variables, first x then u: Note also the live variables, first x then y:\nEspecially note the lower limit of integration, which is 1 and not 0: The logarithm is\nthe area measured from 1. Therefore ln 1 D 0 at that starting point--as required.\nEarlier chapters integrated all powers except this \"1 power.\" The logarithm is\nthat missing integral. The curve in Figure 6.11 has height y D 1=x--it is a hyperbola.\nAt x D 0 the height goes to infinity and the area becomes infinite: log 0 D\n8:\nThe minus sign is because the integral goes backward from 1 to 0: The integral does\nnot extend past zero to negative x: We are defining ln x only for x\n¡ 0:\nFig. 6.11\nLogarithm as area. Neighbors ln aCln b D ln ab:\nEqual areas:\nln 1\n2 D ln 2 D 1\n2 ln 4:\nWith this new approach, ln x has a direct definition. It is an integral (or an area).\nIts two key properties must follow from this definition. That step is a beautiful\napplication of the theory behind integrals.\nProperty 1:\nln ab D ln aCln b: The areas from 1 to a and from a to ab combine\ninto a single area (1 to ab in the middle figure):\nNeighboring areas W\n» a\nx dx C\n» ab\na\nx dx D\n» ab\nx dx:\n(2)\nThe right side is ln ab; from definition (1).

The choice u D x=a satisfies these requirements. Substituting x D au and dx D\na du yields dx=x D du=u: Equation (3) gives ln b; and equation (2) is ln aCln b D\nln ab:\nThe logarithm of\n1 is i (an imaginary number). That is because ei D\n1: The logarithm\nof i is also imaginary--it is 1\n2i: In general, logarithms are complex numbers.\n\n6.4\nLogarithms\nProperty 2:\nln bn D n ln b: These are the left and right sides of\n» bn\nx dx\n.‹/\nD n\n» b\nu du:\n(4)\nThis comes from the substitution x D un: The lower limit x D 1 corresponds to\nu D 1; and x D bn corresponds to u D b: The differential dx is nun 1du: Divid-\ning by x D un leaves dx=x D n du=u: Then equation (4) becomes ln bn D n ln b:\nEverything comes logically from the definition as an area.

When the exponent is an irrational num-\nber like ; how do we multiply e by itself times ? One approach (not taken) is\nto come closer and closer to by rational exponents like 22=7: Another approach\n(taken now) is to determine the number e D 23:1 ::: by its logarithm. Start with e\nitself:\ne is (by definition) the number whose logarithm is 1\ne is (by definition) the number whose logarithm is :\nWhen the area in Figure 6.12 reaches 1; the basepoint is e. When the area reaches\n; the basepoint is e: We are constructing the inverse function (which is ex). But\nhow do we know that the area reaches or 1000 or\n1000 at exactly one point ? (The\narea is 1000 far out at e1000: The area is\n1000 very near zero at e\n1000:) To define\ne we have to know that somewhere the area equals 1!\nFor a proof in two steps, go back to Figure 6.11c. The area from 1 to 2 is more\nthan 1\n2 (because 1=x is more than 1\n2 on that interval of length one). The combined\narea from 1 to 4 is more than 1: We come to area D 1 before reaching 4: (Actually\nat e D 2:718::::) Since 1=x is positive, the area is increasing and never comes back\nto 1:\nTo double the area we have to square the distance. The logarithm creeps up-\nwards:\nln x\nN\nbut\nln x\nx\nN 0:\n(5)\nThe logarithm grows slowly because ex grows so fast (and vice versa--they are\ninverses). Remember that ex goes past every power xn: Therefore ln x is passed by\nevery root x1=n: Problems 60 and 61 give two proofs that .ln x/=x1=n approaches\nzero.\nWe might compare ln x with\n?x: At x D 10 they are close (2:3 versus 3:2). But\nout at x D e10 the comparison is 10 against e5; and ln x loses to\n?x:\nChapter 9 goes on to imaginary exponents, and proves the remarkable formula ei D\n1:\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nFig. 6.12\nArea is logarithm of basepoint.\nFig. 6.13\nln x grows more slowly\nthan x:\nAPPROXIMATION OF LOGARITHMS\nFig. 6.14\nThe limiting cases ln 0 D\n8 and ln\n8 D C\n8 are important.

By the Fundamental Theorem, the slope must be 1=x:\nFor ln u.x/ the derivative comes from the chain rule. The inside function is u; the\noutside function is ln: (Keep u\n¡ 0 to define ln u:) The chain rule gives\nd\ndx ln cx D 1\ncx c D 1\nx .S/\nd\ndx ln x3 D 3x2=x3 D 3\nx\nd\ndx ln.x2 C1/ D 2x=.x2C1/\nd\ndx ln cos x D\nsin x\ncos x D\ntanx\nd\ndx ln ex D ex=ex D 1\nd\ndx ln.ln x/ D\nln x\nx :\nThose are worth another look, especially the first. Any reasonable person would\nexpect the slope of ln 3x to be 3=x: Not so. The 3 cancels, and ln 3x has the same\nslope as ln x: (The real reason is that ln 3x D ln 3Cln x:) The antiderivative of 3=x\nis not ln 3x but 3 ln x; which is ln x3:\nBefore moving to integrals, here is a new method for derivatives: logarithmic\ndifferentiation or LD. It applies to products and powers. The product and power\nrules are always available, but sometimes there is an easier way.\nMain idea: The logarithm of a product p.x/ is a sum of logarithms. Switching to\nln p; the sum rule just adds up the derivatives. But there is a catch at the end, as you\nsee in the example.\nEXAMPLE 4\nFind dp=dx if p.x/ D xx\n?\nx\n1: Here ln p.x/ D x ln x C 1\n2 ln.x\n1/:\nTake the derivative of ln p:\np\ndp\ndx Dx\nx Cln x C\n2.x\n1/:\nNow multiply by p.x/:\ndp\ndx Dp\n\n1Cln x C\n2.x\n1/\n\n:\nThe catch is that last step. Multiplying by p complicates the answer. This can't be\nhelped--logarithmic differentiation contains no magic. The derivative of p D fg is\nthe same as from the product rule: ln p D ln f Cln g gives\np\np D f\nf C g\ng\nand\np\n1 D p\nf\nf C g\ng\n\nD f\n1g Cfg\n1:\n(7)\nFor p D xex sin x; with three factors, the sum has three terms:\nln p D ln x Cx Cln sin x and p\n1 D p\nx C1C cos x\nsin x\n\n:\nWe multiply p times p\n1=p (the derivative of ln p).

Many integrals produce logarithms. The foremost\nexample is 1=x; whose integral is ln x: In a certain way that is the only example,\nbut its range is enormously extended by the chain rule. The derivative of ln u.x/ is\nu\n1=u; so the integral goes from u\n1=u back to ln u:\n» du=dx\nu.x/ dx D ln u.x/\nor equivalently\n» du\nu D ln u:\nTry to choose u.x/ so that the integral contains du=dx divided by u:\nEXAMPLES\n»\ndx\nx C7 D ln\n|x C7 |\n»\ndx\ncx C7 D 1\nc ln\n|cx C7 |\nFinal remark When u is negative, ln u cannot be the integral of 1=u: The logarithm\nis not defined when u\n0: But the integral can go forward by switching to\nu:\n» du=dx\nu\ndx D\n»\ndu=dx\nu\ndx D ln. u/:\n(8)\nThus ln. u/ succeeds when ln u fails.

What we don't know is how to discover those\nsolutions, when a suggestion \"try ect\" has not been made. Many important\nequations, including these, separate into a y-integral and a t-integral. The answer\ncomes directly from the two separate integrations. When a differential equation is\nreduced that far--to integrals that we know or can look up--it is solved.\nOne particular equation will be emphasized. The logistic equation describes the\nspeedup and slowdown of growth. Its solution is an S-curve, which starts slowly, rises\nquickly, and levels off. (The 1990's are near the middle of the S, if the prediction is\ncorrect for the world population.) S-curves are solutions to nonlinear equations, and\nwe will be solving our first nonlinear model. It is highly important in biology and all\nlife sciences.\nSEPARABLE EQUATIONS\nThe equations dy=dt D cy and dy=dt D cy Cs (with constant source s) can be\nsolved by a direct method. The idea is to separate y from t:\ndy\ny D c dt\nand\ndy\ny C.s=c/ D c dt:\n(2)\nAll y's are on the left side. All t's are on the right side (and c can be on either side).\nThis separation would not be possible for dy=dt D y Ct:\nEquation (2) contains differentials. They suggest integrals. The t-integrals give ct\nand the y-integrals give logarithms:\nln y D ct Cconstant\nand\nln\n\ny C s\nc\n\nD ct Cconstant:\n(3)\nThe constant is determined by the initial condition. At t D 0 we require y D y0;\nand the right constant will make that happen:\nln y D ct Cln y0\nand\nln\n\ny C s\nc\n\nD ct Cln\n\ny0 C s\nc\n\n:\n(4)\nThen the final step isolates y: The goal is a formula for y itself, not its logarithm, so\ntake the exponential of both sides (eln y is y):\ny D y0ect\nand\ny C s\nc D\n\ny0 C s\nc\n\nect:\n(5)\nIt is wise to substitute y back into the differential equation, as a check.\nThis is our fourth method for y\n1 D cy Cs: Method 1 assumed from the start that\ny D Aect CB: Method 2 multiplied all inputs by their growth factors ec.t\nT / and\nadded up outputs. Method 3 solved for y\ny\n8: Method 4 is separation of variables\n(and all methods give the same answer). This separation method is so useful that we\nrepeat its main idea, and then explain it by using it.\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nFig. 6.15\nThe solutions to separable equations dy\ndt D y2 and dy\ndt D ny\nt or dy\ny D ndt\nt :\nTo solve dy=dt D u.y/v.t/; separate dy=u.y/ from v.t/dt and inte-\ngrate both sides:\n»\ndy=u.y/ D\n»\nv.t/dt CC:\n(6)\nThen substitute the initial condition to determine C; and solve for y.t/:\nEXAMPLE 1\ndy=dt D y2\nseparates\ninto\ndy=y2 D dt:\nIntegrate\nto\nreach\n1=y D t CC: Substitute t D 0 and y D y0 to find C D\n1=y0: Now solve for y:\ny D t\ny0\nand\ny D\ny0\nty0\n:\nThis solution blows up (Figure 6.15a) when t reaches 1=y0: If the bank pays interest\non your deposit squared (y\n1 D y2), you soon have all the money in the world.\nEXAMPLE 2\ndy=dt D ty separates into dy=y D t dt: Then by integration\nln y D 1\n2t2 CC: Substitute t D 0 and y D y0 to find C D ln y0: The exponential of\n2t2 Cln y0 gives y D y0et2=2: When the interest rate is c D t; the exponent is t2=2:\nEXAMPLE 3\ndy=dt D y Ct is not separable. Method 1 survives by assuming\ny D Aet CB CDt--with an extra coefficient D in Problem 23: Method 2 also\nsucceeds--but not the separation method.\nEXAMPLE 4\nSeparate dy=dt D ny=t into dy=y D n dt=t: By integration ln y D\nnln t CC: Substituting t D 0 produces ln 0 and disaster. This equation cannot start\nfrom time zero (it divides by t). However y can start from y1 at t D 1; which gives\nC D ln y1: The solution is a power function y D y1tn.\nThis was the first differential equation in the book (Section 2:2). The ratio of dy=y\nto dt=t is the \"elasticity\" in economics. These relative changes have units like\ndollars=dollars--they are dimensionless, and y D tn has constant elasticity n:\nOn log-log paper the graph of ln y D n ln t CC is a straight line with slope n:\nTHE LOGISTIC EQUATION\nThe simplest model of population growth is dy=dt D cy: The growth rate c is the\nbirth rate minus the death rate. If c is constant the growth goes on forever--beyondthe\npoint where the model is reasonable. A population can't grow all the way to infinity!\nEventually there is competition for food and space, and y D ect must slow down.\n\n6.5\nSeparable Equations Including the Logistic Equation\nThe true rate c depends on the population size y: It is a function c.y/ not a\nconstant. The choice of the model is at least half the problem:\nProblem in biology or ecology:\nDiscover c.y/:\nProblem in mathematics:\nSolve dy=dt D c.y/y:\nEvery model looks linear over a small range of y's--but not forever. When the rate\ndrops off, two models are of the greatest importance. The Michaelis-Menten equation\nhas c.y/ D c=.yCK/: The logistic equation has c.y/ D c\nby: It comes first.\nThe nonlinear effect is from \"interaction.\" For two populations of size y and z;\nthe number of interactions is proportional to y times z: The Law of Mass Action\nproduces a quadratic term byz: It is the basic model for interactions and\ncompetition. Here we have one population competing within itself, so z is the same\nas y: This competition slows down the growth, because\nby2 goes into the equation.\nThe basic model of growth versus competition is known as the logistic equation:\ndy=dt D cy\nby2:\n(7)\nNormally b is very small compared to c: The growth begins as usual (close to ect).\nThe competition term by2 is much smaller than cy; until y itself gets large. Then\nby2 (with its minus sign) slows the growth down. The solution follows an S-curve\nthat we can compute exactly.\nWhat are the numbers b and c for human population? Ecologists estimate the\nnatural growth rate as c D :029=year. That is not the actual rate, because of b:\nAbout 1930; the world population was 3 billion. The cy term predicts a yearly\nincrease of .:029/.3 billion/ D 87 million: The actual growth was more like\ndy=dt D 60 million=year: That difference of 27 million=year was by2:\n27 million=year D b.3 billion/2 leads to b D 3\n12=year:\nCertainly b is a small number (three trillionths) but its effect is not small. It reduces\n87 to 60: What is fascinating is to calculate the steady state, when the new term by2\nequals the old term cy: When these terms cancel each other, dy=dt D cy\nby2 is\nzero. The loss from competition balances the gain from new growth: cy D by2 and\ny D c=b: The growth stops at this equilibrium point--the top of the S-curve:\ny\n8 D c\nb D :029\n3 1012\n10 billion people:\nAccording to Verhulst's logistic equation, the world population is converging to 10\nbillion. That is from the model. From present indications we are growing much faster.\nWe will very probably go beyond 10 billion. The United Nations report in Section 3:3\npredicts 11 billion to 14 billion.\nNotice a special point halfway to y\n8 D c=b. (In the model this point is at 5\nbillion.) It is the inflection point where the S-curve begins to bend down. The second\nderivative d 2y=dt2 is zero. The slope dy=dt is a maximum. It is easier to find this\npoint from the differential equation (which gives dy=dt) than from y: Take one more\nderivative:\ny\n2 D .cy\nby2/\n1 D cy\n2byy\n1 D .c\n2by/y\n1:\n(8)\nThe factor c\n2by is zero at the inflection point y D c=2b; halfway up the S-curve.\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nTHE S-CURVE\nThe logistic equation is solved by separating variables y and t:\ndy=dt D cy\nby2 becomes\n»\ndy=.cy\nby2/ D\n»\ndt:\n(9)\nThe first question is whether we recognize this y-integral. No. The second question is\nwhether it is listed in the cover of the book. No. The nearest is r\ndx=.a2\nx2/; which\ncan be reached with considerable manipulation (Problem 21). The third question is\nwhether a general method is available. Yes. \"Partial fractions\" is perfectly suited to\n1=.cy\nby2/; and Section 7:4 gives the following integral of equation (9):\nln\ny\nc\nby D ct CC\nand then\nln\ny0\nc\nby0\nD C:\n(10)\nThat constant C makes the solution correct at t D 0: The logistic equation is\nintegrated, but the solution can be improved.

But the logistic\nequation is not linear--it is not y that increases so fast. According to (11), it is\ny=.c\nby/ that grows to infinity. This happens when c\nby approaches zero.\nThe growth stops at y D c=b: That is the final population of the world (10 bil-\nlion ? ).\nWe still need a formula for y: The perfect S-curve is the graph of y D 1=.1C\ne\nt/: It equals 1 when t D\n8; it equals 1\n2 when t D 0; it equals 0 when t D\n8: It\nsatisfies y\n1 D y\ny2; with c D b D 1: The general formula cannot be so beautiful,\nbecause it allows any c;b; and y0: To find the S-curve, multiply equation (11) by\nc\nby and solve for y:\ny D\nc\nb Ce\nctc\nby0\n\n=y0\nor\ny D\nc\nb Cde\nct :\n(12)\nWhen t approaches infinity, e\nct approaches zero.

Pearl and Reed used census figures for 1790;1850; and 1910 to compute c\nand b: In between, the fit is good but not fantastic. One reason is war--another is depres-\nsion. Probably more important is immigration. In fact the Pearl-Reed steady state c=b is\nbelow 200 million, which the US has already passed. Certainly their model can be and\nhas been improved. The 1990 census predicted a stop before 300 million. For constant\nimmigration s we could still solve y\n1 D cy\nby2 Cs by partial fractions--but in practice\nthe computer has taken over. The table comes from Braun's book Differential Equations\n(Springer 1975).\nRemark\nFor good science the y2 term should be explained and justified. It gave\na nonlinear model that could be completely solved, but simplicity is not necessar-\nily truth. The basic justification is this: In a population of size y; the number of\nencounters is proportional to y2: If those encounters are fights, the term is\nby2: If\nthose encounters increase the population, as some like to think, the sign is changed.\nThere is a cooperation term Cby2; and the population increases very fast.\nEXAMPLE 5\ny\n1 D cy Cby2:\ny goes to infinity in a finite time.\nEXAMPLE 6\ny\n1 D\ndy Cby2:\ny dies to zero if y0\nd=b:\nIn Example 6 death wins.

Arrows go toward\nstable steady states. The arrows go away, when the stationary point is unstable.

Without them, your life would be in slow\nmotion. Blood would take years to clot. Steaks would take decades to digest. Calculus\nwould take centuries to learn. The whole system is awesomely beautiful--DNA tells\namino acids how to combine into useful proteins, and we get enzymes and elephants\nand Isaac Newton.\nBriefly, the enzyme enters the reaction and comes out again. It is the catalyst. Its\ncombination with the substrate is an unstable intermediate, which breaks up into a\nnew product and the enzyme (which is ready to start over).\nHere are examples of catalysts, some good and some bad.\n1. The platinum in a catalytic converter reacts with pollutants from the car engine.\n(But platinum also reacts with lead--ten gallons of leaded gasoline and you can\nforget the platinum.)\n2. Spray propellants (CFC's) catalyze the change from ozone (O3) into ordinary\noxygen (O2). This wipes out the ozone layer--our shield in the atmosphere.\n3. Milk becomes yoghurt and grape juice becomes wine.\n\n6.5\nSeparable Equations Including the Logistic Equation\n4. Blood clotting needs a whole cascade of enzymes, amplifying the reaction at\nevery step. In hemophilia--the \"Czar's disease\"--the enzyme called Factor VIII\nis missing. A small accident is disaster; the bleeding won't stop.\n5. Adolph's Meat Tenderizer is a protein from papayas. It predigests the steak.\nThe same enzyme (chymopapain) is injected to soften herniated disks.\n6. Yeast makes bread rise. Enzymes put the sour in sourdough.\nOf course, it takes enzymes to make enzymes. The maternal egg contains the material\nfor a cell, and also half of the DNA. The fertilized egg contains the full instructions.\nWe now look at the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation, to describe these reactions.\nIt is based on the Law of Mass Action. An enzyme in concentration z converts a\nsubstrate in concentration y by dy=dt D\nbyz: The rate constant is b; and you see\nthe product of \"enzyme times substrate.\" A similar law governs the other reactions\n(some go backwards). The equations are nonlinear, with no exact solution. It is typical\nof applied mathematics (and nature) that a pattern can still be found.\nWhat happens is that the enzyme concentration z.t/ quickly drops to z0K=.y C\nK/: The Michaelis constant K depends on the rates (like b) in the mass action laws.\nLater the enzyme reappears (z\n8 D z0). But by then the first reaction is over. Its law\nof mass action is effectively\ndy\ndt D\nbyz D\n\ncy\ny CK\n(17)\nwith c D bz0K: This is the Michaelis-Menten equation--basic to biochemistry.\nThe rate dy=dt is all-important in biology. Look at the function cy=.y CK/:\nwhen y is large; dy=dt\n\nc\nwhen y is small; dy=dt\n\ncy=K:\nThe start and the finish operate at different rates, depending whether y dominates K\nor K dominates y: The fastest rate is c:\nA biochemist solves the MM equation by separating variables:\n» y CK\ny\ndy D\n\n»\nc dt\ngives\ny CK ln y D\nct CC:\n(18)\nSet t D 0 as usual. Then C D y0 CK ln y0: The exponentials of the two sides are\neyyK D e\nctey0yK\n0 :\n(19)\nWe don't have a simple formula for y: We are lucky to get this close. A computer\ncan quickly graph y.t/--and we see the dynamics of enzymes.\nProblems 27\n32 follow up the Michaelis-Menten theory. In science, concentra-\ntions and rate constants come with units. In mathematics, variables can be made\ndimensionless and constants become 1: We solve dY=dT D Y=.Y C1/ and then\nswitch back to y;t;c;K: This idea applies to other equations too.\nEssential point: Most applications of calculus come through differential\nequations. That is the language of mathematics--with populations and chemicals\nand epidemics obeying the same equation. Running parallel to dy=dt D cy are the\ndifference equations that come next.\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\n6.5\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe equations dy=dt D cy and dy=dt D cy Cs and dy=dt D\nu.y/v.t/ are called\na\nbecause we can separate y from t:\nIntegration of\nr\ndy=y D\nr\nc dt\ngives\nb\n.

It is the special base for which ex has slope\n1 at x D 0. That led to the great equation of exponential growth: The derivative of\nex equals ex. But our look at the actual number e D 2:71828::: was very short.\nIt appeared as the limit of .1C1=n/n. This seems an unnatural way to write down\nsuch an important number.\nI want to show how .1C1=n/n and .1Cx=n/n arise naturally. They give dis-\ncrete growth in finite steps--with applications to compound interest. Loans and life\ninsurance and money market funds use the discrete form of y\n1 D cy Cs. (We\ninclude extra information about bank rates, hoping this may be useful some day.) The\napplications in science and engineering are equally important. Scientific computing,\nlike accounting, has difference equations in parallel with differential equations.\nKnowing that this section will be full of formulas, I would like to jump ahead and\ntell you the best one. It is an infinite series for ex. What makes the series beautiful is\nthat its derivative is itself.\nStart with y D 1Cx. This has y D 1 and y\n1 D 1 at x D 0. But y\n2 is zero, not one.\nSuch a simple function doesn't stand a chance! No polynomial can be its own deriva-\ntive, because the highest power xn drops down to nxn 1. The only way is to have no\nhighest power. We are forced to consider infinitely many terms--a power series--to\nachieve \"derivative equals function.\"\nTo produce the derivative 1Cx; we need 1Cx C 1\n2x2: Then\n2x2 is the\nderivative of\n6x3; which is the derivative of\n24x4: The best way is to write\nthe whole series at once:\nInfinite series\nex D 1Cx C 1\n2x2 C 1\n6x3 C 1\n24x4 C\n\n:\n(1)\nThis must be the greatest power series ever discovered. Its derivative is itself:\ndex=dx D 0C1Cx C 1\n2x2 C 1\n6x3 C\n\nD ex:\n(2)\nThe derivative of each term is the term before it. The integral of each term is the one\nafter it (so\nr\nexdx D ex CC ). The approximation ex\n1Cx appears in the first two\nterms. Other properties like .ex/.ex/ D e2x are not so obvious. (Multiplying series\nis hard but interesting.) It is not even clear why the sum is 2:718 ::: when x D 1.\nSomehow 1C1C 1\n2 C 1\n6 C\n\nequals e: That is where .1C1=n/n will come in.\nNotice that xn is divided by the product 1\n\nn: This is \"n factorial.\" Thus\nx4 is divided by 1\n4 D 4S D 24; and x5 is divided by 5S D 120: The derivative\nof x5=120 is x4=24; because 5 from the derivative cancels 5 from the factorial. In\ngeneral xn=nS has derivative xn 1=.n\n1/S Surprisingly 0S is 1:\nChapter 10 emphasizes that xn=nS becomes extremely small as n increases. The\ninfinite series adds up to a finite number--which is ex: We turn now to discrete\ngrowth, which produces the same series in the limit.\nThis headline was on page one of the New York Times for May 27; 1990:\n213 Years After Loan, Uncle Sam is Dunned\nSan Antonio, May 26--More than 200 years ago, a wealthy Pennsylvania\nmerchant named Jacob DeHaven lent $450;000 to the Continental Congress to\nrescue the troops at Valley Forge. That loan was apparently never repaid.\n\n6.6\nPowers Instead of Exponentials\nSo Mr. DeHaven's descendants are taking the United States Government to\ncourt to collect what they believe they are owed. The total: $141 billion if the\ninterest is compounded daily at 6 percent, the going rate at the time. If compounded\nyearly, the bill is only $98 billion.\nThe thousands of family members scattered around the country say they are\nnot being greedy. \"It's not the money--it's the principle of the thing,\" said\nCarolyn Cokerham, a DeHaven on her father's side who lives in San Antonio.\n\"You have to wonder whether there would even be a United States if this man had\nnot made the sacrifice that he did. He gave everything he had.\"\nThe descendants say that they are willing to be flexible about the amount of\nsettlement. But they also note that interest is accumulating at $190 a second.\n\"None of these people have any intention of bankrupting the Government,\"\nsaid Jo Beth Kloecker, a lawyer from Stafford, Texas. Fresh out of law school,\nMs. Kloecker accepted the case for less than the customary 30 percent contingency.\nIt is unclear how many descendants there are. Ms. Kloecker estimates that based\non 10 generations with four children in each generation, there could be as many as\nhalf a million.\nThe initial suit was dismissed on the ground that the statute of limitations is\nsix years for a suit against the Federal Government. The family's appeal asserts\nthat this violates Article 6 of the Constitution, which declares as valid all debts\nowed by the Government before the Constitution was adopted.\nMr. DeHaven died penniless in 1812: He had no children.\nCOMPOUND INTEREST\nThe idea of compound interest can be applied right away. Suppose you invest\n$1000 at a rate of 100% (hard to do). If this is the annual rate, the interest after a\nyear is another $1000: You receive $2000 in all. But if the interest is compounded\nyou receive more:\nafter six months: Interest of $500 is reinvested to give $1500\nend of year: New interest of $750 (50% of 1500) gives $2250 total.\nThe bank multiplied twice by 1:5 (1000 to 1500 to 2250). Compounding quarterly\nmultiplies four times by 1:25 (1 for principal, :25 for interest):\nafter one quarter the total is 1000C.:25/.1000/D1250\nafter two quarters the total is 1250C.:25/.1250/D1562:50\nafter nine months the total is 1562:50C.:25/.1562:50/D1953:12\nafter a full year the total is 1953:12C.:25/.1953:12/D2441:41\nEach step multiplies by 1C.1=n/; to add one nth of a year's interest--still at 100%:\nquarterly conversion: .1C1=4/4\n1000 D2441:41\nmonthly conversion: .1C1=12/12\n1000D2613:04\ndaily conversion: .1C1=365/365\n1000 D2714:57:\nMany banks use 360 days in a year, although computers have made that obsolete.\nVery few banks use minutes (525;600 per year).

You never see e without a\nlimit! It can be defined by derivatives or integrals or powers .1C1=n/n or by an\ninfinite series. Something goes to zero or infinity, and care is required.\nAll terms in equation (4) are below (or equal to) the corresponding terms in (5).\nThe power .1C1=n/n approaches e from below. There is a steady increase with n:\nFaster compounding yields more interest. Continuous compounding at 100% yields\ne; as each term in (4) moves up to its limit in (5).\n\n6.6\nPowers Instead of Exponentials\nRemark\nChange .1C1=n/n to .1Cx=n/n: Now the binomial theorem produces\nex:\n\n1C x\nn\nn\nD 1Cn\nx\nn\n\nC n.n\n1/\nx\nn\nC\n\napproaches 1Cx C x2\n2 C\n\n: (6)\nPlease recognize ex on the right side!

The slow\nmethod (multiplying out every term) led to the infinite series. Together they show the\nagreement of all our definitions of e:\nDIFFERENCE EQUATIONS VS. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\nWe have the chance to see an important part of applied mathematics. This is not\na course on differential equations, and it cannot become a course on difference\nequations. But it is a course with a purpose--we aim to use what we know. Our\nmain application of e was to solve y\n1 D cy and y\n1 D cy Cs: Now we solve the\ncorresponding difference equations.\nAbove all, the goal is to see the connections. The purpose of mathematics is to\nunderstand and explain patterns. The path from \"discrete to continuous\" is beauti-\nfully illustrated by these equations. Not every class will pursue them to the end, but I\ncannot fail to show the pattern in a difference equation:\ny.t C1/ D ay.t/:\n(7)\nEach step multiplies by the same number a: The starting value y0 is followed by\nay0, a2y0, and a3y0: The solution at discrete times t D 0;1;2; ::: is y.t/ D aty0:\nThis formula aty0 replaces the continuous solution ecty0 of the differential\nequation.\nFig. 6.17\nGrowth for\n|a\n|\n¡ 1; decay for\n|a\n|\n1: Growth factor a compares to ec:\nA source or sink (birth or death, deposit or withdrawal) is like y\n1 D cy Cs:\ny.t C1/ D ay.t/Cs:\n(8)\nEach step multiplies by a and adds s: The first outputs are\ny.1/ D ay0Cs;\ny.2/ D a2y0 Cas Cs;\ny.3/ D a3y0 Ca2s Cas Cs:\nWe saw this pattern for differential equations--every input s becomes a new start-\ning point.

For d D 0\n(fixed demand regardless of price) the economy is out of control.\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF FINANCE\nIt would be a pleasure to make this supply-demandmodel more realistic--with curves,\nnot straight lines. Stability depends on the slope--calculus enters. But we\nalso have to be realistic about class time. I believe the most practical application is\nto solve the fundamental problems of finance. Section 6.3 answered six questions\nabout continuous interest. We now answer the same six questions when the annual\nrate is x D :05 D 5% and interest is compounded n times a year.\nFirst we compute effective rates, higher than :05 because of compounding:\ncompounded quarterly\n\n1C :05\nD1:0509\nh\neffective rate :0509 D 5:09%\ni\ncompounded continuously\ne:05 D1:0513\nh\neffective rate 5:13%\ni\nNow come the six questions. Next to the new answer (discrete) we write the old\nanswer (continuous). One is algebra, the other is calculus. The time period is 20\nyears, so simple interest on y0 would produce.:05/.20/.y0/: That equals y0--money\ndoubles in 20 years at 5% simple interest.\nQuestions 1 and 2 ask for the future value y and present value y0 with compound\ninterest n times a year:\n1: y growing from y0W\ny D\n\n1C :05\nn\n20n\ny0\ny De.:05/.20/y0\n2: deposit y0 to reach yW\ny0 D\n\n1C :05\nn\n\n20n\ny\ny0 De\n.:05/.20/y\nEach step multiplies by a D .1C:05=n/: There are 20n steps in 20 years. Time goes\nbackward in Question 2. We divide by the growth factor instead of multiplying. The\nfuture value is greater than the present value (unless the interest rate is negative!). As\nn\nN\n8 the discrete y on the left approaches the continuous y on the right.\nQuestions 3 and 4 connect y to s (with y0 D 0 at the start). As soon as each s is\ndeposited, it starts growing. Then y D s Cas Ca2s C\n\n:\n3: y growing from deposits sW\ny D s\n\"\n.1C:05=n/20n\n:05=n\n#\ny Ds\n\"\ne.:05/.20/\n:05\n#\n4: deposits s to reach yW\ns Dy\n\"\n:05=n\n.1C:05=n/20n\n#\ns Dy\n\"\n:05\ne.:05/.20/\n#\n\nExponentials and Logarithms\nQuestions 5 and 6 connect y0 to s: This time y is zero--there is nothing left at the\nend. Everything is paid. The deposit y0 is just enough to allow payments of s: This\nis an annuity, where the bank earns interest on your y0 while it pays you s (n times\na year for 20 years). So your deposit in Question 5 is less than 20ns:\nQuestion 6 is the opposite--a loan. At the start you borrow y0 (instead of giving\nthe bank y0). You can earn interest on it as you pay it back. Therefore your payments\nhave to total more than y0: This is the calculation for car loans and mortgages.\n5: Annuity: Deposit y0 to receive 20n payments of s:\ny0 D s\n\"\n.1C:05=n/\n20n\n:05=n\n#\ny0 D s\n\"\ne\n.:05/.20/\n:05\n#\n6: Loan: Repay y0 with 20n payments of s:\ns D y0\n\n:05=n\n.1C:05=n/\n20n\n\ns D y0\n\n:05\ne\n.:05/.20/\n\nQuestions 2;4;6 are the inverses of 1;3;5: Notice the pattern: There are three\nnumbers y;y0; and s: One of them is zero each time. If all three are present, go\nback to equation (9).\nThe algebra for these lines is in the exercises. It is not calculus because t is not\ndt. All factors in brackets\n\nare listed in tables, and the banks keep copies. It\nmight also be helpful to know their symbols.

I am now\ngoing to see if the bank is honest.\nRemark\nIn many loans, the bank computes interest on the amount paid back\ninstead of the amount received. This is called discounting. A loan of $1000 at 5%\nfor one year costs $50 interest. Normally you receive $1000 and pay back $1050:\nWith discounting you receive $950 (called the proceeds) and you pay back $1000:\nThe true interest rate is higher than 5%--because the $50 interest is paid on the\nsmaller amount $950: In this case the \"discount rate\" is 50=950 D 5:26%:\nSCIENTIFIC COMPUTING: DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS BY\nDIFFERENCE EQUATIONS\nIn biology and business, most events are discrete.

In practice the\nmagnitude of ct must come down to .10 or .05: For accurate calculations it would\nhave to be even smaller, unless we change to a better difference equation. That is the\nright thing to do.\nNotice the two reasonable numbers. They are :35 and :36; approaching e\n1 D :37:\nThey come from n D 10 (with t D 1=10) and n D 20 (with t D 1=20).

The second is usually pronounced \"cinch\".\nThe graphs in Figure 6.18 show that cosh x\n¡ sinh x. For large x both hyperbolic\nfunctions come extremely close to 1\n2ex. When x is large and negative, it is e\nx that\ndominates. Cosh x still goes up to C\n8 while sinh x goes down to\n8 (because\nsinh x has a minus sign in front of e\nx).\nFig. 6.18\nCosh x and sinh x.

      "content": "CHAPTER 7\nTechniques of Integration\nChapter 5 introduced the integral as a limit of sums. The calculation of areas was\nstarted--by hand or computer. Chapter 6 opened a different door. Its new functions\nex and lnx led to differential equations. You might say that all along we have been\nsolving the special differential equation df=dx D v.x/. The solution is f Dr\nv.x/ dx.\nBut the step to dy=dx D cy was a breakthrough.\nThe truth is that we are able to do remarkable things. Mathematics has a lan-\nguage, and you are learning to speak it. A short time ago the symbols dy=dx and\nr\nv.x/ dx were a mystery. (My own class was not too sure about v.x/ itself--the\nsymbol for a function.) It is easy to forget how far we have come, in looking ahead to\nwhat is next.\nI do want to look ahead. For integrals there are two steps to take--more functions\nand more applications. By using mathematics we make it live. The applications are\nmost complete when we know the integral. This short chapter will widen (very much)\nthe range of functions we can integrate. A computer with symbolic algebra widens it\nmore.\nUp to now, integration depended on recognizing derivatives. If v.x/ D sec2 x then\nf .x/ D tan x. To integrate tan x we use a substitution:\n» sin x\ncos x dx D\n\n» du\nu D\nln u D\nln cos x:\nWhat we need now are techniques for other integrals, to change them around until\nwe can attack them. Two examples are r\nx cos x dx and r\n?\nx2 dx, which are\nnot immediately recognizable. With integration by parts, and a new substitution, they\nbecome simple.\nThose examples indicate where this chapter starts and stops. With reasonable\neffort (and the help of tables, which is fair) you can integrate important functions.\nWith intense effort you could integrate even more functions. In older books that\nextra exertion was made--it tended to dominate the course. They had integrals like\nr\n.x C1/ dx=\n?\n2x2\n6x C4, which we could work on if we had to. Our time is\ntoo valuable for that! Like long division, the ideas are for us and their intricate\nelaboration is for the computer.\nIntegration by parts comes first. Then we do new substitutions. Partial fractions\nis a useful idea (already applied to the logistic equation y\n1 D cy\nby2/. In the last\nsection x goes to infinity or y.x/ goes to infinity--but the area stays finite. These\nimproper integrals are quite common. Chapter 8 brings the applications.\n\nTechniques of Integration\n7.1 Integration by Parts\nThere are two major ways to manipulate integrals (with the hope of making them\neasier). Substitutions are based on the chain rule, and more are ahead. Here we present\nthe other method, based on the product rule. The reverse of the product rule, to find\nintegrals not derivatives, is integration by parts.\nWe have mentioned\nr\ncos2 x dx and\nr\nlnx dx. Now is the right time to compute\nthem (plus more examples). You will see how\nr\nlnx dx is exchanged for\nr\n1 dx--\na definite improvement. Also r\nxex dx is exchanged for r\nex dx. The difference\nbetween the harder integral and the easier integral is a known term--that is the point.\nOne note before starting: Integration by parts is not just a trick with no meaning.\nOn the contrary, it expresses basic physical laws of equilibrium and force balance.\nIt is a foundation for the theory of differential equations (and even delta functions).\nThe final paragraphs, which are completely optional, illustrate those points too.\nWe begin with the product rule for the derivative of u.x/ times v.x/:\nu.x/dv\ndx Cv.x/du\ndx D d\ndx .u.x/v.x//:\n(1)\nIntegrate both sides. On the right, integration brings back u.x/v.x/. On the left are\ntwo integrals, and one of them moves to the other side (with a minus sign):\n»\nu.x/dv\ndx dx D u.x/v.x/\n\n»\nv.x/du\ndx dx:\n(2)\nThat is the key to this section--not too impressive at first, but very powerful. It is\nintegration by parts (u and v are the parts). In practice we write it without x's:\n7A The integration by parts formula is\nr\nu dv D uv\n\nr\nv du:\n(3)\nThe problem of integrating u dv=dx is changed into the problem of integrating\nvdu=dx. There is a minus sign to remember, and there is the \"integrated term\"\nu.x/v.x/. In the definite integral, that product u.x/v.x/ is evaluated at the end-\npoints a and b:\n» b\na\nudv\ndx dx D u.b/v.b/\nu.a/v.a/\n\n» b\na\nvdu\ndx dx:\n(4)\nThe key is in choosing u and v. The goal of that choice is to make r\nv du easier\nthan\nr\nu dv. This is best seen by examples.\nEXAMPLE 1\nFor\nr\nln x dx choose u D ln x and dv D dx (so v D x):\n»\nln x dx D uv\n\n»\nv du D x ln x\n\n»\nx 1\nx dx:\nI used the basic formula (3). Instead of working with ln x (searching for an\nantiderivative), we now work with the right hand side. There x times 1=x is 1. The\nintegral of 1 is x. Including the minus sign and the integrated term uv D x ln x and\nthe constant C , the answer isr\nln x dx D x ln x\nx CC:\n(5)\nFor safety, take the derivative. The product rule gives ln x Cx.1=x/\n1, which is\nln x. The area under y D ln x from 2 to 3 is 3ln 3\n2ln 2C2.\n\n7.1\nIntegration by Parts\nTo repeat: We exchanged the integral of ln x for the integral of 1.\nEXAMPLE 2\nFor r\nx cos x dx choose u D x and dv D cos x dx (so v.x/ D sin x):\nr\nx cos x dx D uv\n\nr\nv du D x sin x\n\nr\nsin x dx:\n(6)\nAgain the right side has a simple integral, which completes the solution:\nr\nx cos x dx D x sin x Ccos x CC:\n(7)\nNote\nThe new integral is not always simpler. We could have chosen u D cos x and\ndv D x dx. Then v D 1\n2x2. Integration using those parts give the true but useless\nresult\nr\nx cos x dx D uv\nr\nv du D 1\n2x2 cos x Cr 1\n2x2 sin x dx:\nThe last integral is harder instead of easier (x2 is worse than x). In the forward\ndirection this is no help. But in the opposite direction it simplifies\nr 1\n2x2 sin x dx.\nThe idea in choosing u and v is this: Try to give u a nice derivative and dv a nice\nintegral.\nEXAMPLE 3\nFor\nr\n.cos x/2 dx choose u D cos x and dv D cos x dx (so v D sin x):\nr\n.cos x/2 dx D uv\n\nr\nv du D cos x sin x C\nr\n.sin x/2 dx:\nThe integral of .sin x/2 is no better and no worse than the integral of .cos x/2. But\nwe never see .sin x/2 without thinking of 1\n.cos x/2. So substitute for .sin x/2:\nr\n.cos x/2 dx D cos x sin x Cr\n1 dx\nr\n.cos x/2 dx:\nThe last integral on the right joins its twin on the left, and r\n1 dx D x:\nr\n.cos x/2 dx D cos x sin x Cx:\nDividing by 2 gives the answer, which is definitely not 1\n3.cos x/3. Add any C :\nr\n.cos x/2 dx D 1\n2.cos x sin x Cx/CC:\n(8)\nQuestion Integrate .cos x/2 from 0 to 2. Why should the area be ?\nAnswer\nThe definite integral is\n2.cos x sin x Cx/\n0 . This does give . That\narea can also be found by common sense, starting from .cos x/2 C.sin x/2 D 1. The\narea under 1 is 2. The areas under .cos x/2 and .sin x/2 are the same. So each one\nis .\nEXAMPLE 4\nEvaluate r\ntan\n1 x dx by choosing u D tan\n1 x and v D x:\n»\ntan\n1 x dx D uv\n\n»\nv du D x tan\n1 x\n\n»\nx\ndx\n1Cx2 :\n(9)\nThe last integral has w D 1Cx2 below and almost has dw D 2x dx above:\n»\nx dx\n1Cx2 D 1\n» dw\nw D 1\n2 ln w D 1\n2 ln.1Cx2/:\nSubstituting back into (9) gives\nr\ntan\n1 x dx as x tan\n1 x\n2 ln.1Cx2/. All the\nfamiliar inverse functions can be integrated by parts (take v D x, and add \"CC \" at\nthe end).\nOur final example shows how two integrations by parts may be needed, when the\nfirst one only simplifies the problem half way.\n\nTechniques of Integration\nEXAMPLE 5\nFor r\nx2exdx choose u D x2 and dv D exdx\n(so v D ex):\nr\nx2ex dx D uv\nr\nv du D x2ex\nr\nex.2x dx/:\n(10)\nThe last integral involves xex. This is better than x2ex, but it still needs work:\nr\nxexdx D uv\nr\nv du D xex\nr\nex dx\n.now u D x/:\n(11)\nFinally ex is alone. After two integrations by parts, we reach\nr\nexdx. In equation (11),\nthe integral of xex is xex\nex. Substituting back into (10),\nr\nx2ex dx D x2ex\n2Œxex\nexCC:\n(12)\nThese five examples are in the list of prime candidates for integration by parts:\nxnex; xn sin x; xn cos x; xn lnx; ex sin x; ex cos x; sin\n1 x; tan\n1 x; ::: :\nThis concludes the presentation of the method--brief and straightforward.\nFigure 7.1a shows how the areas\nr\nu dv and\nr\nv du fill out the difference between\nthe big area u.b/v.b/ and the smaller area u.a/v.a/.\nFig. 7.1\nThe geometry of integration by parts. Delta function (area 1) multiplies v.x/ at\nxD0:\nIn the movie Stand and Deliver, the Los Angeles teacher Jaime Escalante\ncomputed r\nx2 sin x dx with two integrations by parts. His success was through\nexercises--plus insight in choosing u and v. (Notice the difference from r\nx sin x2 dx.\nThat falls the other way--to a substitution.) The class did extremely well on the\nAdvanced Placement Exam. If you saw the movie, you remember that the examiner\ndidn't believe it was possible. I spoke to him long after, and he confirms that practice\nwas the key.\nTHE DELTA FUNCTION\nFrom the most familiar functions we move to the least familiar. The delta function\nis the derivative of a step function. The step function U.x/ jumps from 0 to 1 at\nx D 0. We write ı.x/ D dU=dx, recognizing as we do it that there is no genuine\nderivative at the jump. The delta function is the limit of higher and higher spikes--\nfrom the \"burst of speed\" in Section 1.2. They approach an infinite spike concentrated\nat a single point (where U jumps). This \"non-function\" may be unconventional--it is\ncertainly optional--but it is important enough to come back to.\nThe slope dU=dx is zero except at x D 0, where the step function jumps. Thus\nı.x/ D 0 except at that one point, where the delta function has a \"spike.\" We cannot\ngive a value for ı at x D 0, but we know its integral across the jump. On every\ninterval from\nA to A, the integral of dU=dx brings back U :\n» A\nA\nı.x/ dx D\n» A\nA\ndU\ndx dx D U.x/\nA\nA D 1:\n(13)\n\"The area under the infinitely tall and infinitely thin spike ı.x/ equals 1.\"\n\n7.1\nIntegration by Parts\nSo far so good. The integral of ı.x/ is U.x/. We now integrate by parts for a crucial\npurpose--to find the area under v.x/ı.x/. This is an ordinary function times the\ndelta function. In some sense v.x/ times ı.x/ equals v.0/ times ı.x/--because away\nfrom x D 0 the product is always zero. Thus exı.x/ equals ı.x/, and sin x ı.x/ D 0.\nThe area under v.x/ı.x/ is v.0/--which integration by parts will prove:\n7B The integral of v.x/ times ı.x/ is r A\nA v.x/ı.x/dx D v.0/.\nThe area is v.0/ because the spike is multiplied by v.0/--the value of the smooth\nfunction v.x/ at the spike. But multiplying infinity is dangerous, to say the least.\n(Two times infinity is infinity). We cannot deal directly with the delta function. It is\nonly known by its integrals! As long as the applications produce integrals (as they\ndo), we can avoid the fact that ı is not a true function.\nThe integral of v.x/ı.x/ D v.x/dU=dx is computed \"by parts:\"\n» A\nA\nv.x/ı.x/ dx D v.x/U.x/\niA\nA\n\n» A\nA\nU.x/dv\ndx dx:\n(14)\nRemember that U D 0 or U D 1. The right side of (14) is our area v.0/:\nv.A/\n\n» A\n1dv\ndx dx D v.A/\n.v.A/\nv.0// D v.0/:\n(15)\nWhen v.x/ D 1, this answer matches\nr\nı dx D 1. We give three examples:\nr 2\n2 cos x ı.x/ dx D 1\nr 6\n5.U.x/Cı.x//dx D 7\nr 1\n1.ı.x//2dx D\n8:\nA nightmare question occurs to me. What is the derivative of the delta function ?\nINTEGRATION BY PARTS IN ENGINEERING\nPhysics and engineering and economics frequently involve products. Work is force\ntimes distance. Power is voltage times current. Income is price times quantity. When\nthere are several forces or currents or sales, we add the products. When there are\ninfinitely many, we integrate (probably by parts).\nI start with differential equations for the displacement u at point x in a bar:\ndv\ndx D f .x/ withv.x/ D k du\ndx :\n(16)\nThis describes a hanging bar pulled down by a force f .x/. Each point x moves through\na distance u.x/. The top of the bar is fixed, so u.0/ D 0. The stretching in the bar is\ndu=dx. The internal force created by stretching is v D k du=dx. (This is Hooke's\nlaw.) Equation (16) is a balance of forces on the small piece of the bar in Figure 7.2.\n\nTechniques of Integration\nFig. 7.2\nDifference in internal force balances external force\nv D fx or\ndv=dx D f .x/\nv D W at x D 1 balances hanging weight\nEXAMPLE 6\nSuppose f .x/ D F , a constant force per unit length. We can solve (16):\nv.x/ D\nF x CC\nand\nku.x/ D\n2F x2 CCx CD:\n(17)\nThe constants C and D are settled at the endpoints (as usual for integrals). At x D 0\nwe are given u D 0 so D D 0. At x D 1 we are given v D W so C D W CF . Then\nv.x/ and u.x/ give force and displacement in the bar.\nTo see integration by parts, multiply\ndv=dx D f .x/ by u.x/ and integrate:\n» 1\nf .x/u.x/ dx D\n\n» 1\ndv\ndx u.x/ dx D\nu.x/v.x/\ni1\n0 C\n» 1\nv.x/du\ndx dx: (18)\nThe left side is force times displacement, or external work. The last term is inter-\nnal force times stretching--or internal work. The integrated term has u.0/ D 0--the\nfixed support does no work. It also has\nu.1/W , the work by the hanging weight.\nThe balance of forces has been replaced by a balance of work.\nThis is a touch of engineering mathematics, and here is the main point. Integration\nby parts makes physical sense! When\ndv=dx D f is multiplied by other functions--\ncalled test functions or virtual displacements--then equation (18) becomes the\nprinciple of virtual work. It is absolutely basic to mechanics.\n7.1\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nIntegration by parts is the reverse of the\na\nrule. It changes\nr\nu dv into\nb\nminus\nc\n.

For example r\nx2\n?\nx2 dx\nwill become r\nsin2cos2 d. That looks simpler because the square root is gone.\nBut still sin2cos2 has to be integrated. This brief section integrates any product\nof sines and cosines and secants and tangents.\nThere are two methods to choose from. One uses integration by parts, the other\nis based on trigonometric identities. Both methods try to make the integral easy (but\nthat may take time). We follow convention by changing the letter back to x.\nNotice that sin4x cos x dx is easy to integrate. It is u4du: This is the goal in\nExample 1--to separate out cos x dx: It becomes du; and sin x is u:\nEXAMPLE 1\nr\nsin2xcos3x dx (the exponent 3 is odd)\nSolution\nKeep cos x dx as du: Convert the other cos2x to 1\nsin2x:\n»\nsin2xcos3x dx D\n»\nsin2x.1\nsin2x/cos x dx D sin3x\nsin5x\nCC:\nEXAMPLE 2\nr\nsin5x dx (the exponent 5 is odd)\nSolution\nKeep sin x dx and convert everything else to cosines. The conversion\nis always based on sin2x Ccos2x D 1:\nr\n.1\ncos2x/2 sin x dx D\nr\n.1\n2cos2x Ccos4x/sin x dx:\nNow cos x is u and\nsin x dx is du: We have r\n. 1C2u2\nu4/du:\nGeneral method for\nr\nsinmx cosnx dx; when m or n is odd\nIf n is odd, separate out a single cos x dx: That leaves an even number of cosines.\nConvert them to sines. Then cos x dx is du and the sines are u's.\nIf m is odd, separate out a single sin x dx as du: Convert the rest to cosines.\nIf m and n are both odd, use either method.\nIf m and n are both even, a new method is needed. Here are two examples.\nEXAMPLE 3\nr\ncos2x dx\n(m D 0; n D 2; both even)\nThere are two good ways to integrate cos2x; but substitution is not one of them. If\nu equals cos x; then du is not here. The successful methods are integration by parts\nand double-angle formulas. Both answers are in equation (2) below--I don't see\neither one as the obvious winner.\nIntegrating cos2x by parts was Example 3 of Section 7.1. The other approach, by\ndouble angles, is based on these formulas from trigonometry:\ncos2x D 1\n1Ccos 2x\n\nsin2x D 1\ncos 2x\n\n(1)\nThe integral of cos 2x is 1\n2 sin 2x: So these formulas can be integrated directly. They\ngive the only integrals you should memorize--either the integration by parts form,\nor the result from these double angles:\nr\ncos2x dx equals\nx Csin x cos x\n\nor\n2x C 1\n4 sin 2x\n.plus C/:\n(2)\nr\nsin2x dx equals\nx\nsin x cos x\n\nor\n2x\n4 sin2x\n.plus C/:\n(3)\n\n7.2\nTrigonometric Integrals\nEXAMPLE 4\nr\ncos4x dx\n(m D 0; n D 4; both are even)\nChanging cos2x to 1\nsin2x gets us nowhere. All exponents stay even. Substituting\nu D sin x won't simplify sin4x dx; without du: Integrate by parts or switch to 2x:\nFirst solution Integrate by parts.\nTake u D cos3x and dv D cos x dx:\nr\n.cos3x/.cos x dx/ D uv\n\nr\nv du D cos3x sin x\n\nr\n.sin x/. 3cos2x sin x dx/:\nThe last integral has even powers sin2x and cos2x: This looks like no progress.\nReplacing sin2x by 1\ncos2x produces cos4x on the right-hand side also:\nr\ncos4x dx D cos3x sin x C3 r\ncos2x.1\ncos2x/dx:\nAlways even powers in the integrals. But now move 3\nr\ncos4x dx to the left side:\nReduction\nr\ncos4x dx D cos3x sin x C3\nr\ncos2x dx:\n(4)\nPartial success--the problem is reduced from cos4x to cos2x: Still an even power,\nbut a lower power. The integral of cos2x is already known. Use it in equation (4):\nr\ncos4x dx D 1\n4cos3x sin x C 3\nx Csin x cos x\n\nCC:\n(5)\nSecond solution Substitute the double-angle formula cos2x D 1\n2 C 1\n2 cos 2x:\nr\ncos4x dx D\nr\n. 1\n2 C 1\n2 cos 2x/2dx D 1\nr\n.1C2 cos 2x Ccos2 2x/dx:\nCertainly\nr\ndx D x: Also 2\nr\ncos 2x dx D sin 2x: That leaves the cosine squared:\nr\ncos22x D r 1\n2.1Ccos 4x/dx D 1\n2x C 1\n8 sin 4x CC:\nThe integral of cos4x using double angles is\n\nx Csin 2x C 1\n2x C 1\n8 sin 4x\n\nCC:\n(6)\nThat solution looks different from equation (5), but it can't be. There all angles were\nx; here we have 2x and 4x: We went from cos4x to cos22x to cos 4x; which was\nintegrated immediately. The powers were cut in half as the angle was doubled.\nDouble-angle method for r\nsinmx cosnx dx; when m and n are even:\nReplace sin2x by 1\n2.1\ncos 2x/ and cos2x by 1\n2.1Ccos 2x/: The exponents drop\nto m=2 and n=2: If those are even, repeat the idea (2x goes to 4x). If m=2 or n=2 is\nodd, switch to the \"general method\" using substitution. With an odd power, we have\ndu:\nEXAMPLE 5\n(Double angle)\nr\nsin2x cos2x dx D r 1\n4.1\ncos 2x/.1Ccos 2x/dx:\nThis leaves 1\ncos2 2x in the last integral. That is familiar but not necessarily easy.\nWe can look it up (safest) or remember it (quickest) or use double angles again:\n»\n.1\ncos2 2x/dx D 1\n»\n2 cos 4x\n\ndx D x\nsin 4x\nCC:\nConclusion Every sinmx cosnx can be integrated. This includes negative m and\nn-- see tangents and secants below. Symbolic codes like MACSYMA or Mathemat-\nica give the answer directly. Do they use double angles or integration by parts ?\n\nTechniques of Integration\nYou may prefer the answer from integration by parts (I usually do). It avoids 2x\nand 4x: But it makes no sense to go through every step every time. Either a computer\ndoes the algebra, or we use a \"reduction formula\" from n to n\n2:\nReduction\nnr\ncosnx dx D cosn 1x sin x C.n\n1/ r\ncosn 2x dx:\n(7)\nFor n D 2 this is\nr\ncos2x dx--the integral to learn. For n D 4 the reduction produces\ncos2x: The integral of cos6x goes to cos4x: There are similar reduction formulas for\nsinmx and also for sinmx cosnx: I don't see a good reason to memorize them.\nINTEGRALS WITH ANGLES px AND qx\nInstead of sin8x times cos6x; suppose you have sin 8x times cos 6x: How do you\nintegrate? Separately a sine and cosine are easy. The new question is the integral of\nthe product:\nEXAMPLE 6\nFind r 2\nsin 8x cos 6x dx:\nMore generally find r 2\nsin px cos qx dx.\nThis is not for the sake of making up new problems. I believe these are the most\nimportant definite integrals in this chapter (p and q are 0;1;2; :::). They may be\nthe most important in all of mathematics, especially because the question has such a\nbeautiful answer. The integrals are zero. On that fact rests the success of Fourier\nseries, and the whole industry of signal processing.\nOne approach (the slow way) is to replace sin 8x and cos 6x by powers of cosines.\nThat involves cos14x: The integration is not fun. A better approach, which applies to\nall angles px and qx; is to use the identity\nsin px cos qx D 1\n2 sin.pCq/x C 1\n2 sin.p\nq/x:\n(8)\nThus sin 8x cos 6x D 1\n2 sin 14x C 1\n2 sin 2x: Separated like that, sines are easy to\nintegrate:\n» 2\nsin 8x cos 6x dx D\n\ncos 14x\ncos 2x\nD 0:\nSince cos 14x is periodic, it has the same value at 0 and 2: Subtraction gives zero.\nThe same is true for cos 2x: The integral of sine times cosine is always zero over a\ncomplete period (like 0 to 2).\nWhat about sin px sin qx and cos px cos qx ? Their integrals are also zero,\nprovided p is different from q. When p D q we have a perfect square. There is\nno negative area to cancel the positive area. The integral of cos2px or sin2px is :\nEXAMPLE 7\nr 2\nsin 8x sin 7x dx D 0\nand\nr 2\nsin2 8x dx D :\nWith two sines or two cosines (instead of sine times cosine), we go back to the\naddition formulas of Section 1.5. Problem 24 derives these formulas:\nsin px sin qx D\n2 cos.pCq/x C 1\n2 cos.p\nq/x\n(9)\ncos px cos qx D\n2 cos.pCq/x C 1\n2 cos.p\nq/x:\n(10)\nWith p D 8 and q D 7; we get cos 15x and cos x: Their definite integrals are zero.\nWith p D 8 and q D 8; we get cos 16x and cos 0x (which is 1). Formulas (9) and (10)\n\n7.2\nTrigonometric Integrals\nalso give a factor 1\n2: The integral of 1\n2 is :\nr 2\nsin 8x sin 7x dx D\nr 2\ncos 15x dx C 1\nr 2\ncos x dx D0C0\nr 2\nsin 8x sin 8x dx D\nr 2\ncos 16x dx C 1\nr 2\ncos 0x dx D0C\nThe answer zero is memorable. The answer appears constantly in Fourier series.\nNo ordinary numbers are seen in these integrals. The case p D q D 1 brings back\nr\ncos2x dx D 1\n2 C 1\n4 sin 2x:\nSECANTS AND TANGENTS\nWhen we allow negative powers m and n; the main fact remains true. All integrals\nr\nsinmx cosnx dx can be expressed by known functions. The novelty for negative\npowers is that logarithms appear. That happens right at the start, for sin x=cos x\nand for 1=cos x (tangent and secant):\nr\ntan x dx D\n\nr\ndu=u D\nln\n|cos x\n|\n.here u D cos x/\nr\nsec x dx D\nr\ndu=u D\nln\n|sec x Ctan x\n|\n.here u D sec x Ctan x/:\nFor higher powers there is one key identity: 1Ctan2x D sec2x: That is the old\nidentity cos2x Csin2x D 1 in disguise (just divide by cos2x). We switch tangents to\nsecants just as we switched sines to cosines. Since .tan x/\n1 D sec2x and .sec x/\n1 D\nsec x tan x; nothing else comes in.\nEXAMPLE 8\nr\ntan2x dx D\nr\n.sec2x\n1/dx D tan x\nx CC:\nEXAMPLE 9\nr\ntan3x dx D\nr\ntan x.sec2x\n1/dx:\nThe first integral on the right is\nr\nu du D 1\n2u2; with u D tan x: The last integral is\n\nr\ntan x dx: The complete answer is 1\n2.tan x/2 Cln\n|cos x\n|CC: By taking abso-\nlute values, a negative cosine is also allowed. Avoid cos x D 0:\nEXAMPLE 10\nReduction\n»\n.tan x/mdx D .tan x/m1\nm\n\n»\n.tan x/m2dx\nSame idea--separate off .tan x/2 as sec2x\n1: Then integrate .tan x/m2sec2x dx;\nwhich is um2du: This leaves the integral on the right, with the exponent lowered by\n2: Every power .tan x/m is eventually reduced to Example 8 or 9.\nEXAMPLE 11\nr\nsec3x dx D uv\n\nr\nv du D sec x tan x\n\nr\ntan2x sec x dx\nThis was integration by parts, with u D sec x and v D tan x: In the integral on the\nright, replace tan2x by sec2x\n1 (this identity is basic):\nr\nsec3x dx D sec x tan x\n\nr\nsec3x dx C\nr\nsec x dx:\nBring\nr\nsec3x dx to the left side. That reduces the problem from sec3x to sec x:\nI believe those examples make the point--trigonometric integrals are computable.\nEvery product tanmx secnx can be reduced to one of these examples. If n is even we\nsubstitute u D tan x: If m is odd we set u D sec x: If m is even and n is odd, use a\nreduction formula (and always use tan2x D sec2x\n1:)\n\nTechniques of Integration\nI mention very briefly a completely different substitution u D tan 1\n2x: This seems\nto all students and instructors (quite correctly) to come out of the blue:\nsin x D\n2u\n1Cu2\nand\ncos x D 1\nu2\n1Cu2\nand\ndx D 2du\n1Cu2 :\n(11)\nThe x-integral can involve sums as well as products--not only sinmx cosnx but\nalso 1=.5Csin x\ntan x/: (No square roots.) The u-integral is a ratio of ordinary\npolynomials. It is done by partial fractions.\nApplication of\nr\nsec x dx to distance on a map (Mercator projection)\nThe strange integral ln.sec x Ctan x/ has an everyday application. It measures the\ndistance from the equator to latitude x; on a Mercator map of the world.\nAll mapmakers face the impossibility of putting part of a sphere onto a flat page.\nYou can't preserve distances, when an orange peel is flattened. But angles can be\npreserved, and Mercator found a way to do it. His map came before Newton and\nLeibniz. Amazingly, and accidentally, somebody matched distances on the map with\na table of logarithms--and discovered r\nsec x dx before calculus. You would not be\nsurprised to meet sin x; but who would recognize ln.sec x Ctan x/ ?\nThe map starts with strips at all latitudes x: The heights are dx; the lengths are\nproportional to cos x: We stretch the strips by 1=cos x--then Figure 7.3c lines up\nevenly on the page. When dx is also divided by cos x; angles are preserved--a small\nFig. 7.3\nStrips at latitude x are scaled by sec x; making Greenland too large.\nsquare becomes a bigger square. The distance north adds up the strip heights\ndx=cos x: This gives\nr\nsec x dx:\nThe distance to the North Pole is infinite! Close to the Pole, maps are stretched\ntotally out of shape. When sailors wanted to go from A to B at a constant angle with\nthe North Star, they looked on Mercator's map to find the angle.\n7.2\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nTo\nintegrate\nsin4x cos3x;\nreplace\ncos2x\nby\na\n.\nThen\n.sin4x\nsin6x/cos x dx is\nb\ndu: In terms of u D sin x the\nintegral is\nc\n.

To make it work, we have to think of good substitutions--\nwhich make the integral simpler. This section concentrates on the single most valuable\ncollection of substitutions. They are the only ones you should memorize, and two\nexamples are given immediately.\nTo integrate\n?\nx2; substitute x D sin : Do not set u D 1\nx2\ndu\ndx is missing\n\n»\na\nx2 dx\nN\n»\n.cos /.cos d/\n»\ndx\n?\nx2\nN\n» cos d\ncos\nThe expression\n?\nx2 is awkward as a function of x: It becomes graceful as a\nfunction of : We are practically invited to use the equation 1\n.sin /2 D .cos /2:\nThen the square root is simply cos --provided this cosine is positive.\nNotice the change in dx. When x is sin ; dx is cos d. Figure 7.4a shows\nthe original area with new letters. Figure 7.4b shows an equal area, after rewriting\nr\n.cos /.cos d/ as r\n.cos2/d: Changing from x to gives a new height and a\nnew base. There is no change in area--that is the point of substitution.\nTo put it bluntly: If we go from\n?\nx2 to cos ; and forget the difference between\ndx and d; and just compute r\ncos d; the answer is totally wrong.\nFig. 7.4\nSame area for\na\nx2 dx and cos2 d: Third area is wrong: dx ¤ d\nWe still need the integral of cos2: This was Example 3 of integration by parts, and\nalso equation 7:2:6. It is worth memorizing. The example shows this integral, and\nreturns to x:\nEXAMPLE 1\nr\ncos2 d D 1\n2 sin cos C 1\n2 is after substitution\nr\n?\nx2 dx D 1\n2x\n?\nx2C 1\n2sin\n1x is the original problem:\nWe changed sin back to x and cos to\n?\nx2: Notice that is sin\n1x.

Infinite graph but finite area.\nwith a memory from Chapter 4, the substitution x D sin makes the solution\nautomatic. From\nr\nd D we go back to sin\n1x:\nThe rest of this section is about other substitutions. They are more complicated\nthan x D sin (but closely related). A table will display the three main choices--\nsin ;tan ;sec --and their uses.\nTRIGONOMETRIC SUBSTITUTIONS\nAfter working with\n?\nx2; the next step is\n?\nx2: The change x D sin\nsimplified the first, but it does nothing for the second: 4\nsin2 is not familiar.\nNevertheless a factor of 2 makes everything work. Instead of x D sin; the idea\nis to substitute x D 2 sin :\na\nx2 D\na\n4sin2 D 2 cos\nand\ndx D 2 cos d:\nNotice both 2's. The integral is 4r\ncos2 d D 2sin cos C2: But watch closely.\nThis is not 4 times the previous\nr\ncos2 d! Since x is 2 sin ; is now sin\n1.x=2/.\nEXAMPLE 3\nr\n?\nx2dx D 4\nr\ncos2 d D x\na\n.x=2/2C2sin\n1.x=2/:\nBased on\n?\nx2 and\n?\nx2; here is the general rule for\n?\na2\nx2: Substi-\ntute x D asin : Then the a's separate out:\na\na2\nx2 D\na\na2\na2sin2 D a cos\nand\ndx D a cos d:\nThat is the automatic substitution to try, whenever the square root appears.\nEXAMPLE 4\n» 4\nxD0\ndx\n?\nx2 D\n» =2\nD0\n4 cos d\na\n42.sin /2 D\n» =2\nD0\nd D\n2 :\nHere a2 D 16: Then a D 4 and x D 4 sin : The integral has 4 cos above and be-\nlow, so it is r\nd: The antiderivative is just : For the definite integral notice that\nx D 4 means sin D 1; and this means D =2:\nA table of integrals would hide that substitution. The table only gives sin\n1.x=4/:\nThere is no mention of r\nd D : But what if 16\nx2 changes to x2\n16 ?\nEXAMPLE 5\n» 8\nxD4\ndx\n?\nx2\nD ?\nNotice the two changes--the sign in the square root and the limits on x: Example 4\nstayed inside the interval\n|x\n|\n¤ 4; where 16\nx2 has a square root.

The new problem cannot use x D 4 sin ;\nbecause we don't want the square root of\ncos2:\nThe new substitution is x D 4 sec . This turns the square root into 4 tan :\nx D 4 sec gives dx D 4 sec tan d and x2\n16 D 16sec2\n16 D 16tan2:\nThis substitution solves the example, when the limits are changed to :\n» =3\n4 sec tan d\n4 tan\nD\n» =3\nsec d D ln.sec Ctan /\ni=3\nD ln.2C\n?\n3/:\nI want to emphasize the three steps. First came the substitution x D 4 sec : An\nunrecognizable integral became\nr\nsec d: Second came the new limits ( D 0 when\nx D 4; D =3 when x D 8). Then I integrated sec :\nExample 6 has the same x2\n16: So the substitution is again x D 4 sec :\nEXAMPLE 6\n»\nxD8\n16 dx\n.x2\n16/3=2 D\n» =2\nD=3\n64 sec tan d\n.4 tan /3\nD\n» =2\n=3\ncos d\nsin2\n:\nStep one substitutes x D 4 sec : Step two changes the limits to : The upper limit\nx D\n8 becomes D =2; where the secant is infinite. The limit x D 8 again means\nD =3: To get a grip on the integral, I also changed to sines and cosines.\nThe integral of cos =sin2 needs another substitution!

It di-\nvides by sin 0; which is zero. This area is infinite.\n.Warning/2 Example 5 also blew up at x D 4; but the area was not infinite.

This third form 16Cx2 requires a third substitution x D 4 tan : Then\n16Cx2 D 16C16 tan2 D 16 sec2: Here is an example:\nEXAMPLE 7\n»\nxD0\ndx\n16Cx2 D\n» =2\nD0\n4 sec2 d\n16 sec2\nD 1\n=2\nD\n8 :\nTable of substitutions for a2\nx2; a2 Cx2; x2\na2\nx D a sin\nreplaces a2\nx2 by a2cos2 and dx by a cos d\nx D a tan\nreplaces a2 Cx2 by a2sec2\nand dx by asec2 d\nx D a sec replaces x2\na2 by a2tan2\nand dx by a sec tan d\n\nTechniques of Integration\nNote There is a subtle difference between changing x to sin and changing sin to\nu:\nin Example 1, dx was replaced by cos d(new method)\nin Example 6, cos d was already there and became du (old method):\nThe combination cos d was put into the first and pulled out of the second.\nMy point is that Chapter 5 needed du=dx inside the integral. Then .du=dx/dx\nbecame du: Now it is not necessary to see so far ahead. We can try any substi-\ntution. If it works, we win.

More often they are not. It is\nvery common for the integral of P=Q to involve logarithms. We meet logarithms\nimmediately in the simple case 1=.x\n2/; whose integral is ln\n|x\n2 |CC: We meet\nthem again in a sum of simple cases:\n»\nx\n2 C\nx C2\nx\n\ndx D ln\n|x\n2 |C3ln\n|x C2 |\n4ln\n|x\n|CC:\nOur plan is to split P=Q into a sum like this--and integrate each piece.\nWhich rational function produced that particular sum ? It was\nx\n2 C\nx C2\nx D .x C2/.x/C3.x\n2/.x/\n4.x\n2/.x C2/\n.x\n2/.x C2/.x/\nD\n4x C16\n.x\n2/.x C2/.x/:\nThis is P=Q: It is a ratio of polynomials, degree 1 over degree 3: The pieces of P are\ncollected into\n4x C16: The common denominator .x\n2/.x C2/.x/ D x3\n4x\nis Q: But I kept these factors separate, for the following reason. When we start with\nP=Q; and break it into a sum of pieces, the first things we need are the factors of\nQ.\nIn the standard problem P=Q is given. To integrate it, we break it up. The goal of\npartial fractions is to find the pieces--to prepare for integration. That is the tech-\nnique to learn in this section, and we start right away with examples.\nEXAMPLE 1\nSuppose P=Q has the same Q but a different numerator P :\nP\nQ D\n3x2 C8x\n.x\n2/.x C2/.x/ D\nA\nx\n2 C\nB\nx C2 C C\nx :\n(1)\nNotice the form of those pieces! They are the \"partial fractions\" that add to P=Q:\nEach one is a constant divided by a factor of Q: We know the factors x\n2 and x C2\nand x: We don't know the constants A;B;C: In the previous case they were 1;3;\n4:\nIn this and other examples, there are two ways to find them.\nMethod 3 (slow) Put the right side of .1/ over the common denominator Q:\n3x2 C8x\nQ\nD A.x C2/.x/CB.x\n2/.x/CC.x\n2/.x C2/\n.x\n2/.x C2/.x/\n(2)\nWhy is A multiplied by .x C2/.x/ ? Because canceling those factors will leave\nA=.x\n2/ as in equation (1). Similarly we have B=.x C2/ and C=x: Choose the\nnumbers A;B;C so that the numerators match. As soon as they agree, the split-\nting is correct.\nMethod 4 (quicker) Multiply equation (1) by x\n2: That leaves a space:\n3x2 C8x\n.x C2/.x/ D AC B.x\n2/\nx C2\nC C.x\n2/\nx\n:\n(3)\nNow set x D 2 and immediately you have A. The last two terms of (3) are zero,\nbecause x\n2 is zero when x D 2: On the left side, x D 2 gives\n3.2/2C8.2/\n.2C2/.2/\nD 24\n8 D 3:\n.which is A/:\n\n7.4\nPartial Fractions\nNotice how multiplying by x\n2 produced a hole on the left side. Method 2\nis the \"cover-up method.\" Cover up x\n2 and then substitute x D 2. The result\nis 3 D AC0C0; just what we wanted.\nIn Method 1, the numerators of equation (2) must agree. The factors that multiply\nB and C are again zero at xD2: That leads to the same A--but the cover-up method\navoids the unnecessary step of writing down equation (2).\nCalculation of B Multiply equation (1) by x C2; which covers up the .x C2/:\n3x2 C8x\n.x\n2/\n.x/ D A.x C2/\nx\nCB C C.x C2/\nx\n:\n(4)\nNow set x D\n2; so A and C are multiplied by zero:\n3. 2/2C8. 2/\n. 2\n2/\n. 2/ D\n8 D\n1 D B:\nThis is almost full speed, but (4) was not needed. Just cover up in Q and give x the\nright value (which makes the covered factor zero).\nCalculation of C (quickest)\nIn equation (1), cover up the factor .x/ and set x D 0:\n3.0/2C8.0/\n.0\n2/.0C2/\nD\n4 D 1 D C:\n(5)\nTo repeat: The same result A D 3; B D\n1; C D 1 comes from Method 1.\nEXAMPLE 2\nx C2\n.x\n1/.x C3/ D\nA\nx\n1 C\nB\nx C3:\nFirst cover up .x\n1/ on the left and set x D 1: Next cover up .x C3/ and set x D\n3:\n1C2\n.\n/.1C3/ D 3\n4 D A\n3C2\n. 3\n1/.\n/ D\n4 D B:\nThe integral is 3\n4 ln\n|x\n1 |C 1\n4 ln\n|x C3 |CC:\nEXAMPLE 3\nThis was needed for the logistic equation in Section 6.5:\ny.c\nby/ D A\ny C\nB\nc\nby :\n(6)\nFirst multiply by y: That covers up y in the first two terms and changes B to By:\nThen set y D 0: The equation becomes 1=c D A:\nTo find B; multiply by c\nby: That covers up c\nby in the outside terms.

First of all, it requires the factors of the denominator Q: When Q is a\nquadratic ax2 Cbx Cc; we can find its roots and its factors. In theory a cubic or a\n\nTechniques of Integration\nquartic can also be factored, but in practice only a few are possible--for example x4\n\n1 is .x2\n1/.x2C1/: Even for this good example, two of the roots are imaginary.\nWe can split x2\n1 into .x C1/.x\n1/: We cannot split x2 C1 without introducing\ni:\nThe method of partial fractions can work directly with x2 C1; as we now see.\nEXAMPLE 4\n» 3x2 C2x C7\nx2 C1\ndx\n(a quadratic over a quadratic).\nThis has another difficulty. The degree of P equals the degree of Q.D 2/: Partial\nfractions cannot start until P has lower degree. Therefore I divide the leading\nterm x2 into the leading term 3x2: That gives 3; which is separated off by itself:\n3x2 C2x C7\nx2 C1\nD 3C 2x C4\nx2 C1:\n(8)\nNote how 3 really used 3x2 C3 from the original numerator. That left 2x C4: Par-\ntial fractions will accept a linear factor 2x C4 (or Ax CB; not just A) above a\nquadratic.\nThis example contains 2x=.x2 C1/; which integrates to ln.x2 C1/: The final\n4=.x2C1/ integrates to 4 tan\n1 x: When the denominator is x2 Cx C1 we com-\nplete the square before integrating. The point of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 was to make that\nintegration possible. This section gets the fraction ready--in parts.\nThe essential point is that we never have to go higher than quadratics. Every\ndenominator Q can be split into linear factors and quadratic factors. There\nis no magic way to find those factors, and most examples begin by giving them. They\ngo into their own fractions, and they have their own numerators--which are the A and\nB and 2x C4 we have been computing.\nThe one remaining question is what to do if a factor is repeated. This happens in\nExample 5.\nEXAMPLE 5\n2x C3\n.x\n1/2 D\nA\n.x\n1/ C\nB\n.x\n1/2:\nThe key is the new term B=.x\n1/2: That is the right form to expect. With .x\n1/\n.x\n2/ this term would have been B=.x\n2/: But when .x\n1/ is repeated, some-\nthing new is needed. To find B; multiply through by .x\n1/2 and set x D 1:\n2x C3 D A.x\n1/CB\nbecomes\n5 D B\nwhen\nx D 1:\nThis cover-up method gives B: Then A D 2 is easy, and the integral is\n2ln\n|x\n1 |\n5=.x\n1/: The fraction 5=.x\n1/2 has an integral without logarithms.\nEXAMPLE 6\n2x3 C9x2 C4\nx2.x2 C4/.x\n1/ D A\nx C B\nx2 C Cx CD\nx2 C4 C\nE\nx\n1:\nThis final example has almost everything! It is more of a game than a calculus\nproblem. In fact calculus doesn't enter until we integrate (and nothing is new there).\nBefore computing A;B;C;D;E; we write down the overall rules for partial fractions:\n1. The degree of P must be less than the degree of Q: Otherwise divide their\nleading terms as in equation (8) to lower the degree of P: Here 3\n5:\n2. Expect the fractions illustrated by Example 6. The linear factors x and x C1\n(and the repeated x2) are underneath constants. The quadratic x2 C4 is under\na linear term. A repeated .x2 C4/2 would be under a new F x CG:\n\n7.4\nPartial Fractions\n3. Find the numbers A;B;C; ::: by any means, including cover-up.\n4. Integrate each term separately and add.\nWe could prove that this method always works. It makes better sense to show that\nit works once, in Example 6.\nTo find E; cover up .x\n1/ on the left and substitute x D 1: Then E D 3: To\nfind B; cover up x2 on the left and set x D 0: Then B D 4=.0C4/.0\n1/ D\n1:\nThe cover-up method has done its job, and there are several ways to find A;C;D:\nCompare the numerators, after multiplying through by the common denominator Q:\n2x3 C9x2 C4 D Ax.x2C4/.x\n1/\n.x2C4/.x\n1/C.Cx CD/.x2/.x\n1/C3x2.x2 C4/:\nThe known terms on the right, from B D\n1 and E D 3; can move to the left:\n3x4 C3x3\n4x2C4x D Ax.x2 C4/.x\n1/C.Cx CD/x2.x\n1/:\nWe can divide through by x and x\n1; which checks that B and E were correct:\n3x2\n4 D A.x2C4/C.Cx CD/x:\nFinally x D 0 yields A D\n1: This leaves\n2x2 D .Cx CD/x: Then C D\n2 and\nD D 0:\nYou should never have to do such a problem! I never intend to do another one. It\ncompletely depends on expecting the right form and matching the numerators.\nThey could also be matched by comparing coefficients of x4;x3;x2;x;1--to give\nfive equations for A;B;C;D;E: That is an invitation to human error. Cover-up is\nthe way to start, and usually the way to finish. With repeated factors and quadratic\nfactors, match numerators at the end.\n7.4\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe idea of\na\nfractions is to express P.x/=Q.x/ as a\nb\nof simpler terms, each one easy to integrate. To begin,\nthe degree of P should be\nc\nthe degree of Q: Then Q\nis split into\nd\nfactors like x\n5 (possibly repeated) and\nquadratic factors like x2 Cx C1 (possibly repeated). The quadratic\nfactors have two\ne\nroots, and do not allow real linear\nfactors.\nA\nfactor\nlike\nx\ncontributes\na\nfraction A=\nf\n.\nIts\nintegral is\ng\n. To compute A; cover up\nh\nin the\ndenominator of P=Q: Then set x D\ni\n, and the rest of\nP=Q becomes A: An equivalent method puts all fractions over\na common denominator (which is\nj\n). Then match the\nk\n. At the same point x D\nl\nthis matching gives A:\nA\nrepeated\nlinear\nfactor\n.x\n5/2\ncontributes\nnot\nonly\nA=.x\n5/ but also B=\nm\n.

It might be b or a\nor the function y: The region under the graph reaches infinitely far--to the right or left\nor up or down. (Those come from b D\n8 and a D\n8 and y\nN\n8 and y\nN\n8:)\nNevertheless the integral may \"converge.\" Just because the region is infinite, it is not\nautomatic that the area is infinite. That is the point of this section--to decide when\nimproper integrals have proper answers.\nThe first examples show finite area when b D\n8; then a D\n8; then y D 1=\n?x\nat x D 0: The areas in Figure 7.6 are 1;1;2:\n»\ndx\nx2 D\nx\n\nD 1\n» 0\nexdx D exi0\n8 D 1\n» 1\ndx\n?x D 2\n?\nx\ni1\n0 D 2:\nFig. 7.6\nThe shaded areas are finite but the regions go to infinity.\nIn practice we substitute the dangerous limits and watch what happens. When\nthe integral is\n1=x; substituting b D\n8 gives \"1= 8 D 0:\" When the integral is\nex; substituting a D\n8 gives \"e\n8 D 0:\" I think that is fair, and I know it is suc-\ncessful. But it is not completely precise.\nThe strict rules involve a limit. Calculus sneaks up on 1= 8 and e\n8 just as it\nsneaks up on 0=0: Instead of swallowing an infinite region all at once, the formal\ndefinitions push out to the limit:\nDEFINITION\n»\na\ny.x/dx D lim\nb\nN8\n» b\na\ny.x/dx\n» b\ny.x/dx D lim\na\nN8\n» b\na\ny.x/dx:\nThe conclusion is the same. The first examples converged to 1;1;2: Now come two\nmore examples going out to b D\n8:\nThe area under 1=x is infinite:\n»\ndx\nx D ln x\ni\n1 D\n(1)\nThe area under 1=xp is finite if p\n¡ 1 W\n»\ndx\nxp D x1 p\np\n\nD\np\n1:\n(2)\nThe area under 1=x is like 1C 1\n2 C 1\n3 C 1\n4 C\n\n, which is also infinite. In fact the sum\napproximates the integral--the curved area is close to the rectangular area. They go\ntogether (slowly to infinity).\nA larger p brings the graph more quickly to zero. Figure 7.7a shows a finite area\n1=.p\n1/ D 100: The region is still infinite, but we can cover it with strips cut out of\na square! The borderline for finite area is p D 1: I call it the borderline, but p D 1 is\nstrictly on the side of divergence.\n\nTechniques of Integration\nThe borderline is also p D 1 when the function climbs the y axis. At x D 0; the\ngraph of y D 1=xp goes to infinity. For p D 1; the area under 1=x is again infinite.\nBut at x D 0 it is a small p (meaning p\n1) that produces finite area:\n» 1\ndx\nx D ln x\ni1\n0 D\n» 1\ndx\nxp D x1 p\np\nD\np\nif p\n1:\n(3)\nLoosely speaking \"ln 0 D\n8:\" Strictly speaking we integrate from the point x D a\nnear zero, to get\nr 1\na dx=x D\nln a: As a approaches zero, the area shows itself as\ninfinite. For y D 1=x2; which blows up faster, the area\n1=x1\n0 is again infinite.\nFor y D 1=\n?x; the area from 0 to 1 is 2: In that case p D 1\n2: For p D 99=100\nthe area is 1=.1\np/ D 100: Approaching p D 1 the borderline in Figure 7.7 seems\nclear. But that cutoff is not as sharp as it looks.\nFig. 7.7\nGraphs of 1=xp on both sides of p D 1: I drew the same curves!\nNarrower borderline Under the graph of 1=x; the area is infinite. When we divide\nby ln x or .ln x/2; the borderline is somewhere in between. One has infinite area\n(going out to x D\n8), the other area is finite:\n»\ne\ndx\nx.ln x/ D ln.ln x/\ni\ne D\n»\ne\ndx\nx.ln x/2 D\nln x\n\ne\nD 1:\n(4)\nThe first is\nr\ndu=u with u D ln x: The logarithm of ln x does eventually make it to\ninfinity. At x D 1010; the logarithm is near 23 and ln.ln x/ is near 3: That is slow!\nEven slower is ln.ln.ln x// in Problem 11: No function is exactly on the borderline.\nThe second integral in equation (4) is convergent (to 1). It is\nr\ndu=u2 with u D\nln x: At first I wrote it with x going from zero to infinity. That gave an answer I\ncouldn't believe:\n»\ndx\nx.ln x/2 D\nln x\n\nD 0 .‹‹/\nThere must be a mistake, because we are integrating a positive function. The area\ncan't be zero. It is true that 1=ln b goes to zero as b\nN\n8: It is also true that 1=ln a\ngoes to zero as a\nN 0: But there is another infinity in this integral. The trouble is at\nx D 1; where ln x is zero and the area is infinite.\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe factor e\nx overrides any power xp (but only as x\nN\n8).\nr\n0 x50e\nx dx D 50S\nbut\nr\n0 x\n1e\nx dx D\n8:\nThe first integral is .50/.49/.48/\n\n.1/: It comes from fifty integrations by parts (not\nrecommended). Changing 50 to 1\n2; the integral defines \" 1\n2 factorial:\" The product\n\n7.5\nImproper Integrals\n\nhas no way to stop, but somehow 1\n2! is 1\n?: See Problem 28:\nThe integral\nr\n0 x0e\nxdx D 1 is the reason behind \"zero factorial\"D 1: That seems\nthe most surprising of all.\nThe area under e\nx=x is . 1/S D\n8: The factor e\nx is absolutely no help at x D\n0: That is an example (the first of many) in which we do not know an antiderivative--\nbut still we get a decision. To integrate e\nx=x we need a computer. But to decide that\nan improper integral is infinite (in this case) or finite (in other cases), we rely on the\nfollowing comparison test:\n7C (Comparison test)\nSuppose that 0\n¤ u.x/\n¤ v.x/:Then the area under u.x/\nis smaller than the area under v.x/:\nr\nu.x/dx\n\n8 if r\nv.x/dx\n\nif r\nu.x/dx D\n8 then r\nv.x/dx D\n8:\nComparison can decide if the area is finite. We don't get the exact area, but we learn\nabout one function from the other. The trick is to construct a simple function (like\n1=xp) which is on one side of the given function--and stays close to it:\nEXAMPLE 2\n»\ndx\nx2 C4x converges by comparison with\n»\ndx\nx2 D 1:\nEXAMPLE 3\n»\ndx\n?x C1 diverges by comparison with\n»\ndx\n?x D\n8:\nEXAMPLE 4\n» 1\ndx\nx2 C4x diverges by comparison with\n» 1\ndx\n5x D\n8:\nEXAMPLE 5\n» 1\ndx\n?x C1 converges by comparison with\n» 1\ndx\n1 D 1:\nIn Examples 2 and 5, the integral on the right is larger than the integral on the left.\nRemoving 4x and\n?x increased the area. Therefore the integrals on the left are\nsomewhere between 0 and 1:\nIn Examples 3 and 4, we increased the denominators. The integrals on the right\nare smaller, but still they diverge. So the integrals on the left diverge. The idea of\ncomparing functions is seen in the next examples and Figure 7.8.\nEXAMPLE 6\n»\ne\nx2dx is below\n» 1\n1 dx C\n»\ne\nxdx D 1C1:\nEXAMPLE 7\n» e\ndx\nln x is above\n» e\ndx\nx ln x D\n8:\nEXAMPLE 8\n» 1\ndx\n?\nx\nx2 is below\n» 1\ndx\n?x C\n» 1\ndx\n?\nx\nD 2C2:\n\nTechniques of Integration\nFig. 7.8\nComparing u.x/ to v.x/:\nr e\n1 dx=ln x D\nand\nr 1\n0 dx=\na\nx\nx2\n4:\nBut\n\n8 ¤ 0:\nThere are two situations not yet mentioned, and both are quite common.

      "content": "CHAPTER 8\nApplications of the Integral\nWe are experts in one application of the integral--to find the area under a curve.\nThe curve is the graph of y D v.x/; extending from x D a at the left to x D b at the\nright. The area between the curve and the x axis is the definite integral.\nI think of that integral in the following way. The region is made up of thin strips.\nTheir width is dx and their height is v.x/: The area of a strip is v.x/ times dx:\nThe area of all the strips is r b\na v.x/ dx: Strictly speaking, the area of one strip is\nmeaningless--genuine rectangles have width x: My point is that the picture of thin\nstrips gives the correct approach.\nWe know what function to integrate (from the picture). We also know how (from\nthis course or a calculator). The new applications to volume and length and surface\narea cut up the region in new ways. Again the small pieces tell the story. In this\nchapter, what to integrate is more important than how.\n\n8.1\nAreas and Volumes by Slices\n8.1 Areas and Volumes by Slices\nThis section starts with areas between curves. Then it moves to volumes, where the\nstrips become slices. We are weighing a loaf of bread by adding the weights of the\nslices. The discussion is dominated by examples and figures--the theory is minimal.\nThe real problem is to set up the right integral. At the end we look at a different way\nof cutting up volumes, into thin shells. All formulas are collected into final table.\nFigure 8.1 shows the area between two curves. The upper curve is the graph of\ny D v.x/: The lower curve is the graph of y D w.x/: The strip height is v.x/\n\nw.x/; from one curve down to the other. The width is dx (speaking informally again).\nThe total area is the integral of \"top minus bottom\":\narea between two curves D\n» b\na\nh\nv.x/\nw.x/\ni\ndx:\n(1)\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe upper curve is y D 6x (straight line). The lower curve is y D 3x2\n(parabola). The area lies between the points where those curves intersect.\nTo find the intersection points, solve v.x/ D w.x/ or 6x D 3x2:\nFig. 8.1\nArea between curves D integral of v\nw: Area in Example 2 starts with x\n¥ 0:\nOne crossing is at x D 0; the other is at x D 2: The area is an integral from 0 to 2:\narea D r b\na .v\nw/dx D r 2\n0 .6x\n3x2/dx D 3x2\nx3i2\n0 D 4:\nEXAMPLE 2\nFind the area between the circle v D\n?\nx2 and the 45\nline w D\nx:\nFirst question: Which area and what limits ? Start with the pie-shaped wedge in\nFigure 8.1b. The area begins at the y axis and ends where the circle meets the line.\nAt the intersection point we have v.x/ D w.x/:\nfrom\na\nx2 D x squaring gives 1\nx2 D x2 and then 2x2 D 1:\n\nApplications of the Integral\nThus x2 D 1\n2: The endpoint is at x D 1=\n?\n2: Now integrate the strip height v\nw:\n» 1=\n?\n.\na\nx2\nx/dx D 1\n2sin\n1x C 1\n2x\na\nx2\n2x2\n1=\n?\nD 1\n2sin\n?\n\nC 1\n4 D 1\n\n:\nThe area is =8 (one eighth of the circle). To integrate\n?\nx2 dx we apply the\ntechniques of Chapter 7: Set x D sin ; convert to\nr\ncos2 d D 1\n2. Csin cos /;\nconvert back using D sin\n1x: It is harder than expected, for a familiar shape.\nRemark\nSuppose the problem is to find the whole area between the circle and\nthe line. The figure shows v D w at two points, which are x D 1=\n?\n2 (already used)\nand also x D\n1=\n?\n2: Instead of starting at x D 0; which gave 1\n8 of a circle, we now\ninclude the area to the left.\nMain point: Integrating from x D\n1=\n?\n2 to x D 1=\n?\n2 will give the wrong an-\nswer. It misses the part of the circle that bulges out over itself, at the far left. In that\npart, the strips have height 2v instead of v\nw: The figure is essential, to get the\ncorrect area of this half-circle.\nHORIZONTAL STRIPS INSTEAD OF VERTICAL STRIPS\nThere is more than one way to slice a region. Vertical slices give x integrals.\nHorizontal slices give y integrals. We have a free choice, and sometimes the y\nintegral is better.\nFig. 8.2\nVertical slices (x integrals) vs. horizontal slices (y integrals).\nFigure 8.2 shows a unit parallelogram, with base 1 and height 1: To find its area\nfrom vertical slices, three separate integrals are necessary. You should see why! With\nhorizontal slices of length 1 and thickness dy; the area is just r 1\n0 dy D 1:\nEXAMPLE 3\nFind the area under y D ln x (or beyond x D ey) out to x D e:\nThe x integral from vertical slices is in Figure 8.2c. The y integral is in Figure 8.2d.\nThe area is a choice between two equal integrals (I personally would choose y):\nr e\nxD1 ln x dx D\nh\nx ln x\nx\nie\n1 D 1\nor\nr 1\nyD0 .e\ney/ dy D\nh\ney\neyi1\n0D 1:\n\n8.1\nAreas and Volumes by Slices\nVOLUMES BY SLICES\nFor the first time in this book, we now look at volumes. The regions are\nthree-dimensional solids. There are three coordinates x;y;z--and many ways to\ncut up a solid.\nFigure 8.3 shows one basic way--using slices. The slices have thickness dx; like\nstrips in the plane. Instead of the height y of a strip, we now have the area A of a\ncross-section. This area is different for different slices: A depends on x: The volume\nof the slice is its area times its thickness: dV D A.x/dx: The volume of the whole\nsolid is the integral:\nvolume D integral of area times thickness D\nr\nA.x/ dx:\n(2)\nNote\nAn actual slice does not have the same area on both sides! Its thickness is\nx (not dx). Its volume is approximately A.x/x (but not exactly). In the limit, the\nthickness approaches zero and the sum of volumes approaches the integral.\nFor a cylinder all slices are the same. Figure 8.3b shows a cylinder--not circular.\nThe area is a fixed number A; so integration is trivial. The volume is A times h. The\nFig. 8.3\nCross-sections have area A.x/: Volumes are\nr\nA.x/ dx:\nletter h; which stands for height, reminds us that the cylinder often stands on its end.\nThen the slices are horizontal and the y integral or z integral goes from 0 to h:\nWhen the cross-section is a circle, the cylinder has volume r2h:\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe triangular wedge in Figure 8.3b has constant cross-sections with\narea A D 1\n2.3/.4/ D 6: The volume is 6h:\nEXAMPLE 5\nFor the triangular pyramid in Figure 8.3c, the area A.x/ drops from\n6 to 0: It is a general rule for pyramids or cones that their volume has an extra factor\n3 (compared to cylinders). The volume is now 2h instead of 6h: For a cone with base\narea r2; the volume is 1\n3r2h: Tapering the area to zero leaves only 1\n3 of the\nvolume.\nWhy the 1\n3 ? Triangles sliced from the pyramid have shorter sides. Starting from\n3 and 4; the side lengths 3.1\nx=h/ and 4.1\nx=h/ drop to zero at x D h: The area\nis A D 6.1\nx=h/2: Notice: The side lengths go down linearly, the area drops\nquadratically. The factor 1\n3 really comes from integrating x2 to get 1\n3x3:\n» h\nA.x/ dx D\n» h\n\nx\nh\ndx D\n2h\n\nx\nh\n3#h\nD 2h:\n\nApplications of the Integral\nEXAMPLE 6\nA half-sphere of radius R has known volume\n2. 4\n3R3/: Its\ncross-sections are semicircles.

Washer area f 2\ng2:\nSOLIDS OF REVOLUTION\nCones and spheres and circular cylinders are \"solids of revolution.\" Rotating a\nhorizontal line around the x axis gives a cylinder. Rotating a sloping line gives a\ncone. Rotating a semicircle gives a sphere. If a circle is moved away from the axis,\nrotation produces a torus (a doughnut). The rotation of any curve y D f .x/ produces\na solid of revolution.\nThe volume of that solid is made easier because every cross-section is a circle.\nAll slices are pancakes (or pizzas). Rotating the curve y D f .x/ around the x axis\ngives disks of radius y; so the area is A D y2 D Œf .x/2: We add the slices:\nvolume of solid of revolution D\n» b\na\ny2 dx D\n» b\na\nŒf .x/2 dx:\nEXAMPLE 8\nRotating y D\n?x with A D .\n?\nx2/2 produces a \"headlight\"\n(Figure 8.5a):\nvolume of headlightD\nr 2\n0 A dx D\nr 2\n0 x dx D 1\n2x2i2\n0 D 2:\nIf the same curve is rotated around the y axis, it makes a champagne glass.

When we set x D a sin the area is\nr\na2 cos2 d: Not for the last time do we meet cos2:\nThe hardest part is visualizing the washers, because a doughnut usually breaks the\nother way. A better description is a bagel, sliced the long way to be buttered.\n\nApplications of the Integral\nVOLUMES BY CYLINDRICAL SHELLS\nFinally we look at a different way of cutting up a solid of revolution. So far it was\ncut into slices. The slices were perpendicular to the axis of revolution. Now the cuts\nare parallel to the axis, and each piece is a thin cylindrical shell. The new formula\ngives the same volume, but the integral to be computed might be easier.\nFigure 8.6a shows a solid cone. A shell is inside it. The inner radius is x and the\nouter radius is x Cdx: The shell is an outer cylinder minus an inner cylinder:\nshell volume .x Cdx/2h\nx2h D x2hC2x.dx/hC.dx/2h\nx2h:\n(3)\nThe term that matters is 2x.dx/h: The shell volume is essentially 2x (the dis-\ntance around) times dx (the thickness) times h (the height). The volume of the solid\ncomes from putting together the thin shells:\nsolid volume D integral of shell volumesD\n»\n2xh dx:\n(4)\nThis is the central formula of the shell method. The rest is examples.\nRemark on this volume formula It is completely typical of integration that .dx/2\nand .x/2 disappear. The reason is this. The number of shells grows like 1=x:\nTerms of order .x/2 add up to a volume of order x (approaching zero). The\nlinear term involving x or dx is the one to get right. Its limit gives the integral\nr\n2xh dx: The key is to build the solid out of shells--and to find the area or volume\nof each piece.\nEXAMPLE 11\nFind the volume of a cone (base area r2; height b) cut into shells.\nA tall shell at the center has h near b: A short shell at the outside has h near zero.\nIn between the shell height h decreases linearly, reaching zero at x D r: The height\nin Figure 8.6a is h D b\nbx=r: Integrating over all shells gives the volume of the\ncone (with the expected 1\n3):\n» r\n2x\n\nb\nb x\nr\n\ndx D\n\nx2b\n2x3b\n3r\nr\nD 1\n3r2b:\nFig. 8.6\nShells of volume 2xh dx inside cone, sphere with hole, and paraboloid.\n\n8.1\nAreas and Volumes by Slices\nEXAMPLE 12\nBore a hole of radius a through a sphere of radius b\n¡ a:\nThe hole removes all points out to x D a; where the shells begin. The height of the\nshell is h D 2\n?\nb2\nx2: (The key is the right triangle in Figure 8.6b. The height\nupward is\n?\nb2\nx2--this is half the height of the shell.) Therefore the sphere-with-\nhole has\nvolume D r b\na 2xh dx D r b\na 4x\n?\nb2\nx2 dx:\nWith u D b2\nx2 we almost see du: Multiplying du D\n2x dx is an extra factor\n2:\nvolume D\nr\n?u du D\n3u3=2\n:\nWe can find limits on u; or we can put back u D b2\nx2:\nvolume D\n3 .b2\nx2/3=2\nb\na\nD 4\n3 .b2\na2/3=2:\nIf a D b (the hole is as big as the sphere) this volume is zero. If a D 0 (no hole) we\nhave 4b3=3 for the complete sphere.\nQuestion What if the sphere-with-hole is cut into slices instead of shells ?\nAnswer\nHorizontal slices are washers (Problem 66). Vertical slices are not good.\nEXAMPLE 13\nRotate the parabola y D x2 around the y axis to form a bowl.\nWe go out to x D\n?\n2 (and up to y D 2). The shells in Figure 8.6c have height\nh D 2\nx2: The bowl (or paraboloid) is the same as the headlight in Example 8,\nbut we have shells not slices:\n»\n?\n2x.2\nx2/ dx D 2x2\n2x4\n\n?\nD 2:\nTABLE\nOF\nAREAS\nAND\nVOLUMES\narea between curves: A D\nr\n.v.x/\nw.x// dx\nsolid volume cut into slices: V D\nr\nA.x/ dx\nor\nr\nA.y/ dy\nsolid of revolution: cross-section A D y2\nor\nx2\nsolid with hole: washer area A D f 2\ng2\nsolid of revolution cut into shells: V D r\n2xh dx:\nWhich to use, slices or shells ? Start with a vertical line going up to y D cos x:\nRotating the line around the x axis produces a slice (a circular disk). The radius is\ncos x: Rotating the line around the y axis produces a shell (the outside of a cylinder).\nThe height is cos x: See Figure 8.7 for the slice and the shell. For volumes we just\nintegrate cos2x dx (the slice volume) or 2x cos x dx (the shell volume).\nThis is the normal choice--slices through the x axis and shells around the y\naxis. Then y D f .x/ gives the disk radius and the shell height. The slice is a washer\ninstead of a disk if there is also an inner radius g.x/: No problem--just integrate\nsmall volumes.\nWhat if you use slices for rotation around the y axis ? The disks are in Figure 8.7b,\nand their radius is x: This is x D cos\n1y in the example. It is x D f\n1.y/ in gen-\neral. You have to solve y D f .x/ to find x in terms of y: Similarly for shells around\n\nApplications of the Integral\nthe x axis: The length of the shell is x D f\n1.y/: Integrating may be difficult or\nimpossible.\nWhen y D cos x is rotated around the x axis, here are the choices for volume:\n(good by slices) r\ncos2x dx\n(bad by shells) r\n2y cos\n1y dy:\nFig. 8.7\nSlices through x axis and shells around y axis (good).

One is x2 Cy2 D 1: The other is x D cos t,\ny D sin t: Since cos2t Csin2t D 1, this point goes around the correct circle. One\nadvantage of the \"parameter\" t is to give extra information--it tells where the point\nis and also when. In Chapter 1, the parameter was the time and also the angle--\nbecause we moved around the circle with speed 1:\nUsing t is a natural way to give the position of a particle or a spacecraft. We can\nrecover the velocity if we know x and y at every time t: An equation y D f .x/ tells\nthe shape of the path, not the speed along it.\nChapter 12 deals with parametric equations for curves. Here we concentrate on\nthe path length--which allows you to see the idea of a parameter t without too\nmuch detail. We give x as a function of t and y as a function of t: The curve is still\napproximated by straight pieces, and each piece has .s/2 D .x/2C.y/2: But\ninstead of using y\n.dy=dx/x; we approximate x and y separately:\nx\n.dx=dt/t;\ny\n.dy=dt/t;\ns\n\na\n.dx=dt/2 C.dy=dt/2 t:\n8B The length of a parametric curve is an integral with respect to t:\nr\nds D\nr\n.ds=dt/ dt D\nr\na\n.dx=dt/2 C.dy=dt/2 dt:\n(6)\nEXAMPLE 5\nFind the length of the quarter-circle using x D cos t and y D sin t:\n» =2\na\n.dx=dt/2 C.dy=dt/2 dt D\n» =2\na\nsin2t Ccos2t dt D\n» =2\ndt D\n2 :\nThe integral is simpler than 1=\n?\nx2, and there is one new advantage. We can\nintegrate around a whole circle with no trouble. Parametric equations allow a path\nto close up or even cross itself. The time t keeps going and the point .x.t/;y.t//\nkeeps moving. In contrast, curves y D f .x/ are limited to one y for each x:\nEXAMPLE 6\nFind the length of the quarter-ellipse: x D cos t and y D\n?\n2sin t:\nOn this path y2 C2x2 is 2 sin2t C2cos2t D 2 (same ellipse).

If one cannot be done, neither can the other. They\nare related by x D cos t, but (7) does not blow up at the endpoints. The trapezoidal\nrule gives 1:9101 with less than 100 intervals. Section 5.8 mentioned that calculators\nautomatically do a substitution that makes (5) more like (7).\nEXAMPLE 7\nThe path x D t2, y D t3 goes from .0;0/ to .4;8/: Stop at t D 2:\nTo find this path without the parameter t, first solve for t D x1=2: Then substitute\ninto the equation for yW y D t3 D x3=2: The non-parametric form (with t elimi-\nnated) is the same curve y D x3=2 as in Example 1.\nThe length from the t-integral equals the length from the x-integral.

A curve y D f .x/ is revolved around\nan axis. That produces a \"surface of revolution,\" which is symmetric around the\naxis. If we revolve a sloping line, the result is a cone. When the line is parallel to the\naxis we get a cylinder (a pipe). By revolving a curve we might get a lamp or a lamp\nshade (or even the light bulb).\nSection 8.1 computed the volume inside that surface. This section computes the\nsurface area. Previously we cut the solid into slices or shells. Now we need a good\nway to cut up the surface.\nThe key idea is to revolve short straight line segments. Their slope is y=x:\nThey can be the same pieces of length s that were used to find length--now we\ncompute area. When revolved, a straight piece produces a \"thin band\" (Figure 8.10).\nThe curved surface, from revolving y D f .x/, is close to the bands. The first step is\nto compute the surface area of a band.\nA small comment: Curved surfaces can also be cut into tiny patches. Each patch\nis nearly flat, like a little square. The sum of those patches leads to a double integral\n(with dx dy). Here the integral stays one-dimensional (dx or dy or dt). Surfaces of\nrevolution are special--we approximate them by bands that go all the way around.\nA band is just a belt with a slope, and its slope has an effect on its area.\nFig. 8.10\nRevolving a straight piece and a curve around the y axis and x axis.\nRevolve a small straight piece (length s not x). The center of the piece goes\naround a circle of radius r: The band is a slice of a cone. When we flatten it out\n(Problems 11\n13) we discover its area. The area is the side length s times the\nmiddle circumference 2r:\nThe surface area of a band is 2rs D 2r\na\n1C.y=x/2 x:\nFor revolution around the y axis, the radius is r D x: For revolution around the\nx axis, the radius is the height: r D y D f .x/: Figure 8.10 shows both bands--the\nproblem tells us which to use. The sum of band areas 2r s is close to the area S\nof the curved surface. In the limit we integrate 2r ds:\n8C The surface area generated by revolving the curve y D f .x/ between x D a\nand x D b is\nS D r b\na 2y\na\n1C.dy=dx/2 dx\naround the x axis\n.r D y/\n(1)\nS D\nr b\na 2x\na\n1C.dy=dx/2 dx\naround the y axis\n.r D x/:\n(2)\n\n8.3\nArea of a Surface of Revolution\nEXAMPLE 1\nRevolve a complete semicircle y D\n?\nR2\nx2 around the x axis.\nThe surface of revolution is a sphere.

Not many samples are taken\nand not many experiments are made. There is a list of possible outcomes, and a\nknown probability for each outcome. But probabilities go far beyond red cards and\nblack cards. The real questions are much more practical:\n1. How often will too many passengers arrive for a flight ?\n2. How many random errors do you make on a quiz ?\n3. What is the chance of exactly one winner in a big lottery ?\nThose are important questions and we will set up models to answer them.\nThere is another point. Discrete models do not involve calculus. The number of\nerrors or bumped passengers or lottery winners is a small whole number. Calculus\nenters for continuous probability. Instead of results that exactly equal 1 or 2 or\n3, calculus deals with results that fall in a range of numbers. Continuous probability\ncomes up in at least two ways:\n(A) An experiment is repeated many times and we take averages.\n(B) The outcome lies anywhere in an interval of numbers.\nIn the continuous case, the probability pn of hitting a particular value x D n becomes\nzero. Instead we have a probability density p.x/--which is a key idea. The chance\nthat a random X falls between a and b is found by integrating the density p.x/:\nProb\nta\n¤ X\n¤ b\nu D r b\na p.x/ dx:\n(1)\nRoughly speaking, p.x/ dx is the chance of falling between x and x Cdx: Cer-\ntainly p.x/\n¥ 0: If a and b are the extreme limits\n8 and\n8, including all possible\noutcomes, the probability is necessarily one:\nProb\nt8\nX\nC8u D r\n8 p.x/ dx D 1:\n(2)\nThis is a case where infinite limits of integration are natural and unavoidable. In\nstudying probability they create no difficulty--areas out to infinity are often easier.\nHere are typical questions involving continuous probability and calculus:\n4. How conclusive is a 53%\n47% poll of 2500 voters ?\n5. Are 16 random football players safe on an elevator with capacity 3600 pounds?\n6. How long before your car is in an accident ?\nIt is not so traditional for a calculus course to study these questions. They need extra\nthought, beyond computing integrals (so this section is harder than average). But\nprobability is more important than some traditional topics, and also more interesting.\nDrug testing and gene identification and market research are major applications.\nComparing Questions 1-3 with 4-6 brings out the relation of discrete to continuous--\nthe differences between them, and the parallels.\nIt would be impossible to give here a full treatment of probability theory. I believe\nyou will see the point (and the use of calculus) from our examples. Frank Morgan's\nlectures have been a valuable guide.\n\nApplications of the Integral\nDISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES\nA discrete random variable X has a list of possible values. For two dice the outcomes\nare X D 2;3; :::;12: For coin tosses (see below), the list is infinite: X D 1;2;3; ::::\nA continuous variable lies in an interval a\n¤ X\n¤ b:\nEXAMPLE 1\nToss a fair coin until heads come up. The outcome X is the number\nof tosses. The value of X is 1 or 2 or 3 or :::, and the probability is 1\n2 that X D 1\n(heads on the first toss). The probability of tails then heads is p2 D 1\n4: The probability\nthat X D n is pn D . 1\n2/n--this is the chance of n\n1 tails followed by heads.

If X is a score on\nthe SAT, then 200\n¤ X\n¤ 800: If X is the fraction of computer owners in a poll of\n600 people, X is between 0 and 1: You may object that the SAT score is a whole\nnumber and the fraction of computer owners must be 0 or 1=600 or 2=600 or :::: But\nit is completely impractical to work with 601 discrete possibilities. Instead we take\nX to be a continuous random variable, falling anywhere in the range X\n¥ 0 or\nŒ200;800 or 0\n¤ X\n¤ 1: Of course the various values of X are not equally probable.\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe average lifetime of a VCR is 4 years.

The actual scores are between 200 and 800, while the\ndensity p.x/ extends all the way from\n8 to\n8: I think the Educational Testing Ser-\nvice counts all scores over 800 as 800: The fraction of such scores is pretty small--in\nfact the normal distribution gives\nProb\ntX\n¥ 800 u D\n»\n?\ne\n.x\n500/2=2.200/2 dx\n:0013:\n(6)\n\nApplications of the Integral\nFig. 8.12\nThe normal distribution (bell-shaped curve) and its cumulative density F.x/:\nRegrettably, e\nx2 has no elementary antiderivative.

The\nkey idea is to repeat an experiment many times--poll many voters, or toss many\ndice, or play considerable poker. Each independent experiment produces an outcome\nX, and the average from N experiments is NX: It is called \"X bar\":\nNX D X1 CX2 C\n\nCXN\nN\nD average outcome:\nAll we know about p.x/ is its mean and variance 2: It is amazing how much\ninformation that gives about the average NX:\n8F Law of Averages: NX is almost sure to approach as N\nN\n8:\nCentral Limit Theorem: The probability density pN .x/ for NX approaches\na normal distribution with the same mean and variance 2=N:\nNo matter what the probabilities for X, the probabilities for NX move toward the\nnormal bell-shaped curve. The standard deviation is close to =\n?\nN when the\nexperiment is repeated N times. In the Law of Averages, \"almost sure\" means that\nthe chance of NX not approaching is zero. It can happen, but it won't.\nRemark 1\nThe Boston Globe doesn't understand the Law of Averages. I quote\nfrom September 1988 W \"What would happen if a giant Red Sox slump arrived?\nWhat would happen if the fabled Law of Averages came into play, reversing all those\ncan't miss decisions during the winning streak ? \" They think the Law of Averages\nevens everything up, favoring heads after a series of tails. See Problem 20:\nEXAMPLE 7\nYes-no poll of N D 2500 voters. Is a 53%\n47% outcome\nconclusive ?\nThe fraction p of \"yes\" voters in the whole population is not known. That is the\nreason for the poll. The deviation D\n?p.1\np/ is also not known, but for one voter\nthis is never more than 1\n2 (when p D 1\n2). Therefore =\n?\nN for 2500 voters is no larger\nthan 1\n2=\n?\n2500, which is 1%:\nThe result of the poll was NX D 53%: With 95% confidence, this sample is within\ntwo standard deviations (here 2%) of its mean. Therefore with 95% confidence, the\nunknown mean D p of the whole population is between 51% and 55%. This\npoll is conclusive.\nIf the true mean had been p D 50%, the poll would have had only a :0013 chance\nof reaching 53%: The error margin on each side of a poll is amazingly simple; it is\nalways 1=\n?\nN :\nRemark 2\nThe New York Times has better mathematicians than the Globe. Two\ndays after Bush defeated Dukakis, their poll of N D 11;645 voters was printed with\nthe following explanation. \"In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 [there is 95%] the results\nshould differ by no more than one percentage point [there is 1=\n?\nN ] from what would\nhave been obtained by seeking out all voters in the United States.\"\nEXAMPLE 8\nFootball players at Caltech (if any) have average weight D 210\npounds and standard deviation D 30 pounds. Are N D 16 players safe on an\nelevator with capacity 3600 pounds? 16 times 210 is 3360:\n\n8.4\nProbability and Calculus\nThe average weight NX is approximately a normal random variable with N D 210 and\nN D 30=\n?\nN D 30=4: There is only a 2% chance that NX is above NC2N D 225 (see\nFigure 8.12b--weights below the mean are no problem on an elevator). Since 16\ntimes 225 is 3600, a statistician would have 98% confidence that the elevator is safe.\nThis is an example where 98% is not good enough--I wouldn't get on.\nEXAMPLE 9\n(The famous Weldon Dice) Weldon threw 12 dice 26;306 times and\ncounted the 5's and 6's. They came up in 33:77% of the 315;672 separate rolls. Thus\nNX D :3377 instead of the expected fraction p D 1\n3 of 5's and 6's.

Here NX\nis normal.) But :3377 differs from :3333 by more than 5N: The chance of falling 5\nstandard deviations away from the mean is only about 1 in 10;000:\nSo the dice were unfair. The faces with 5 or 6 indentations were lighter than the\nothers, and a little more likely to come up. Modern dice are made to compensate for\nthat, but Weldon never tried again.\n8.4\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nDiscrete\nprobability\nuses\ncounting,\na\nprobability\nuses\ncalculus.

Each\napplication starts with a finite number of masses or forces. Their sum is the total\nmass or total force. Then comes the \"continuous case,\" in which the mass is spread\nout instead of lumped. Its distribution is given by a density function (Greek rho),\nand the sum changes to an integral.\nThe first step (hardest step ? ) is to get the physical quantities straight. The second\nstep is to move from sums to integrals (discrete to continuous, lumped to distributed).\nBy now we hardly stop to think about it--although this is the key idea of integral\ncalculus. The third step is to evaluate the integrals. For that we can use substitution or\nintegration by parts or tables or a computer.\nFigure 8.13 shows the one-dimensional case: masses along the x axis. The total\nmass is the sum of the masses. The new idea is that of moments--when the mass or\nforce is multiplied by a distance:\nmoment of mass around the y axis D mx D(mass) times (distance to axis):\nFig. 8.13\nThe center of mass is at Nx D (total moment)=(total mass)D average distance.\nThe figure has masses 1;3;2. The total mass is 6. The \"lever arms\" or \"moment\narms\" are the distances x D 1;3;7. The masses have moments 1 and 9 and 14 (since\nmx is 2 times 7). The total moment is 1C9C14 D 24. Then the balance point is at\nNx D Mx=M D 24=6 D 4.\nThe total mass is the sum of the m's. The total moment is the sum of mn times\nxn (negative on the other side of x D 0). If the masses are children on a seesaw, the\nbalance point is the center of gravity Nx--also called the center of mass:\nDEFINITION\nNx D\nP mnxn\nP mn\nD total moment\ntotal mass :\n(1)\nIf all masses are moved to Nx, the total moment (6 times 4) is still 24: The moment\nequals the mass Pmn times Nx. The masses act like a single mass at Nx.\nAlso: If we move the axis to Nx, and leave the children where they are, the seesaw\nbalances. The masses on the left of Nx D 4 will offset the mass on the right. Reason:\nThe distances to the new axis are xn\nNx. The moments add to zero by equation .1/:\nmoment around new axis D\nX\nmn.xn\nNx/ D\nX\nmnxn\n\nX\nmn Nx D 0:\nTurn now to the continuous case, when mass is spread out along the line. Each\npiece of length x has an average density n D .mass of piece//.length of piece/ D\nm=x. As the pieces get shorter, this approaches dm=dx--the density at the point.\nThe limit of (small mass)=(small length) is the density .x/.\nIntegrating that derivative D dm=dx, we recover the total mass: Pnx be-\ncomes\ntotal mass M D r\n.x/dx:\n(2)\nWhen the mass is spread evenly, is constant. Then M D L D density times length.\n\nApplications of the Integral\nThe moment formula is similar. For each piece, the moment is mass nx\nmultiplied by distance x--and we add. In the continuous limit, .x/dx is multiplied\nby x and we integrate:\ntotal moment around y axis D My D r\nx.x/ dx:\n(3)\nMoment is mass times distance. Dividing by the total mass M gives \"average\ndistance\":\ncenter of mass Nx D moment\nmass\nD My\nM D\nr\nx.x/ dx\nr\n.x/ dx :\n(4)\nRemark\nIf you studied Section 8:4 on probability, you will notice how the formulas\nmatch up. The mass\nr\n.x/dx is like the total probability\nr\np.x/dx. The moment\nr\nx.x/dx is like the meanr\nxp.x/dx. The moment of inertia r\n.x\nNx/2.x/dx\nis the variance. Mathematics keeps hammering away at the same basic ideas! The only\ndifference is that the total probability is always 1: The mean really corresponds to the\ncenter of mass Nx, but in probability we didn't notice the division by\np.x/dx D 1.\nEXAMPLE 1\nWith constant density from 0 to L, the mass is M D L. The\nmoment is\nMy D r L\n0 xdx D 1\n2x2L\n0 D 1\n2L2:\nThe center of mass is Nx D My=M D L=2. It is halfway along.\nEXAMPLE 2\nWith density e\nx the mass is 1, the moment is 1, and Nx is 1:\nr\n0 e\nx dx D\n\ne\nx\n0 D 1\nand\nr\n0 xe\nx dx D\n\nxe\nx\ne\nx\n0 D 1:\nMASSES AND MOMENTS IN TWO DIMENSIONS\nInstead of placing masses along the x axis, suppose m1 is at the point .x1; y1/ in the\nplane. Similarly mn is at .xn; yn/. Now there are two moments to consider. Around\nthe y axis My D + mnxn and around the x axis Mx D + mnyn. Please notice that\nthe x's go into the moment My--because the x coordinate gives the distance from\nthe y axis!\nAround the x axis, the distance is y and the moment is Mx. The center of mass is\nthe point . Nx; Ny/ at which everything balances:\nNx D My\nM D\nP mnxn\nP mn\nand\nNy D Mx\nM D\nP mnyn\nP mn\n:\n(5)\nIn the continuous case these sums become two-dimensional integrals. The total\nmass is\nrr\n.x;y/dx dy, when the density is Dmass per unit area. These \"double\nintegrals\" are for the future (Section 14:1). Here we consider the most important\ncase: D constant. Think of a thin plate, made of material with constant density (say\nD 1). To compute its mass and moments, the plate is cut into strips Figure 8.14:\nmass M D area of plate\n(6)\nmoment My D\nr\n.distance x/(length of vertical strip) dx\n(7)\nmoment Mx D r\n.height y/(length of horizontal strip) dy:\n(8)\n\n8.5\nMasses and Moments\nFig. 8.14\nPlates cut into strips to compute masses and moments and centroids.\nThe mass equals the area because D 1. For moments, all points in a vertical strip\nare the same distance from the y axis. That distance is x. The moment is x times\narea, or x times length times dx--and the integral accounts for all strips.\nSimilarly the x-moment of a horizontal strip is y times strip length times dy.\nEXAMPLE 3\nA plate has sides x D 0 and y D 0 and y D 4\n2x. Find M;My;Mx.\nmass M D area D\nr 2\n0 y dx D\nr 2\n0 .4\n2x/dx D\n\n4x\nx22\n0 D 4:\nThe vertical strips go up to yD 4\n2x, and the horizontal strips go out to xD 1\n2.4\ny/:\nmoment My D\n» 2\nx.4\n2x/dx D\n\n2x2\n3x3\nD 8\nmoment Mx D\n» 4\ny 1\n2.4\ny/dy D\n\ny2\n6y3\nD 16\n3 :\nThe \"center of mass\" has NxDMy=M D2=3 and NyDMx=M D4=3. This is the cen-\ntroid of the triangle (and also the \"center of gravity\"). With D 1 these terms all refer\nto the same balance point . Nx; Ny/. The plate will not tip over, if it rests on that point.\nEXAMPLE 4\nFind My and Mx for the half-circle below x2 Cy2 D r2.\nMy D 0 because the region is symmetric--Figure 8.14 balances on the y axis. In the\nx-moment we integrate y times the length of a horizontal strip (notice the factor 2):\nMx D r r\n0 y\na\nx2\ny2 dy D\n3.r2\ny2/3=2ir\n0 D 2\n3r3:\nDivide by the mass (the area 1\n2r2) to find the height of the centroid: Ny D Mx=M D\n4r=3.This is less than 1\n2r because the bottom of the semicircle is wider than the top.\nMOMENT OF INERTIA\nThe moment of inertia comes from multiplying each mass by the square of its\ndistance fromthe axis. Aroundthe y axis, the distance is x. Aroundthe origin,it is r:\nIy D + x2\nnmn\nand\nIx D + y2\nnmn\nand\nI0 D + r2\nnmn:\nNotice that Ix CIy D I0 because x2\nn Cy2\nn D r2\nn. In the continuous case we inte-\ngrate.\n\nApplications of the Integral\nThe moment of inertia around the y axis is Iy D rr\nx2.x; y/dx dy. With\na constant density D 1, we again keep together the points on a strip. On a vertical\nstrip they share the same x. On a horizontal strip they share y:\nIy D r\n.x2/ (vertical strip length) dx and Ix D r\n.y2/ (horizontal strip length) dy:\nIn engineering and physics, it is rotation that leads to the moment of inertia. Look at\nthe energy of a mass m going around a circle of radius r. It has I0 D mr2.\nkinetic energy D 1\n2mv2 D 1\n2m.r!/2 D 1\n2I0!2:\n(9)\nThe angular velocity is ! (radians per second). The speed is v D r! (meters per\nsecond).\nAn ice skater reduces I0 by putting her arms up instead of out. She stays close to\nthe axis of rotation (r is small). Since her rotational energy 1\n2I0!2 does not change,\n! increases as I0 decreases. Then she spins faster.\nAnother example: It takes force to turn a revolving door. More correctly, it takes\ntorque. The force is multiplied by distance from the turning axis: T D F x, so a push\nfurther out is more effective.\nTo see the physics, replace Newton's law F D ma D mdv=dt by its rotational\nform: T D I d!=dt. Where F makes the mass move, the torque T makes it turn.\nWhere m measures unwillingness to change speed, I measures unwillingness to change\nrotation.\nEXAMPLE 5\nFind the moment of inertia of a rod about (a) its end and (b) its center.\nThe distance x from the end of the rod goes from 0 to L. The distance from the center\ngoes from\nL=2 to L=2.

Energy loss from rolling friction is very small. If the mass is m and the\nvertical drop is h, the energy at the top (all potential) is mgh. The energy at the\nbottom (all kinetic) has two parts: 1\n2mv2 from movement along the plane plus\n2I!2 from turning.

Apparently\nthe density doesn't matter, because it is a factor in both I and m--so it cancels in\nJ D I=mr2. A hollow cylinder has J D 1, which is the largest possible--all its mass\nis at the full distance r from the axis. So the hollow cylinder should theoretically\ncome in last. This experiment was developed by Daniel Drucker.\nProblems 35\n37 find the other three J 's. Problem 40 finds the time T by integra-\ntion. Your experiment will show how close this comes to the measured time.\n8.5\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nIf masses mn are at distances xn, the total mass is M D\na\n.\nThe total moment around x D 0 is My D\nb\n.

For velocity it was natural to use the letter t: This section is about two\nimportant physical quantities--force and work--for which x is the right choice.\nThe basic formula is W D F x: Work equals force times distance moved (dis-\ntance in the direction of F ). With a force of 100 pounds on a car that moves 20 feet,\nthe work is 2000 foot-pounds. If the car is rolling forward and you are pushing back-\nward, the work is\n2000 foot-pounds. If your force is only 80 pounds and the car\ndoesn't move, the work is zero. In these examples the force is constant.\nW D F x is completely parallel to f D vt: When v is constant, we only need\nmultiplication. It is a changing velocity that requires calculus. The integral\nr\nv.t/dt\nadds up small multiplications over short times. For a changing force, we add up\nsmall pieces of work F dx over short distances:\nW D F x\n.constant force/\nW D r\nF.x/ dx\n.changing force/:\nIn the first case we lift a suitcase weighing F D 30 pounds up x D 20 feet of stairs.\nThe work is W D 600 foot-pounds. The suitcase doesn't get heavier as we go up--it\nonly seems that way. Actually it gets lighter (we study gravity below).\nIn the second case we stretch a spring, which needs more force as x increases.\nHooke's law says that F.x/ D kx: The force is proportional to the stretching dis-\ntance x. Starting from x D 0; the work increases with the square of x:\nF D kx\nand\nW D r x\n0 kx dx D 1\n2 kx2:\n(1)\nIn metric units the force is measured in Newtons and the distance in meters. The unit\nof work is a Newton-meter (a joule). The 600 foot-pounds for an American suitcase\nwould have been about 800 joules in France.\nEXAMPLE 1\nSuppose a force of F D 20 pounds stretches a spring 1 foot.\n(a) Find k:\nThe elastic constant is k D F=x D 20 pounds per foot.\n(b) Find W:\nThe work is 1\n2kx2 D 1\n12 D 10 foot-pounds.\n(c) Find x when F D\n10 pounds. This is compression not stretching: x D\nfoot.\nCompressing the same spring through the same distance requires the same work.\nFor compression x and F are negative. But the work W D 1\n2kx2 is still positive.\nPlease note that W does not equal kx times xS That is the whole point of variable\nforce (change F x to r\nF.x/ dx).\nMay I add another important quantity from physics? It comes from looking at the\nsituation from the viewpoint of the spring. In its natural position, the spring rests\ncomfortably. It feels no strain and has no energy. Tension or compression gives it\npotential energy. More stretching or more compression means more energy. The\nchange in energy equals the work. The potential energy of the suitcase increases by\n600 foot-pounds, when it is lifted 20 feet.\nWrite V.x/ for the potential energy. Here x is the height of the suitcase or the ex-\ntension of the spring. In moving from x D a to x D b; work D increase in potential:\nW D r b\na F.x/ dx D V.b/\nV.a/:\n(2)\nThis is absolutely beautiful. The work W is the definite integral. The potential V is\nthe indefinite integral. If we carry the suitcase up the stairs and back down, our total\n\n8.6\nForce, Work, and Energy\nwork is zero. We may feel tired, but the trip down should have given back our energy.\n(It was in the suitcase.) Starting with a spring that is compressed one foot, and ending\nwith the spring extended one foot, again we have done no work. V D 1\n2kx2 is the\nsame for x D\n1 and x D 1: But an extension from x D 1 to x D 3 requires work:\nW D change in V D 1\n2k.3/2\n2k.1/2:\nIndefinite integrals like V come with a property that we know well. They include\nan arbitrary constant C . The correct potential is not simply 1\n2kx2; it is 1\n2kx2 CC:\nTo compute a change in potential, we don't need C: The constant cancels. But to\ndetermine V itself, we have to choose C . By fixing V D 0 at one point, the potential\nis determined at all other points. A common choice is V D 0 at x D 0: Sometimes\nV D 0 at x D\n8 (for gravity). Electric fields can be \"grounded\" at any point.\nThere is another connection between the potential V and the force F: According\nto (2), V is the indefinite integral of F: Therefore F.x/ is the derivative of V.x/:\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus is also fundamental to physics:\nforce exerted on spring WF D\ndV=dx\n(3a)\nforce exerted by spring WF D\ndV=dx\n(3b)\nThose lines say the same thing. One is our force pulling on the spring, the other\nis the \"restoring force\" pulling back. (3a) and (3b) are a warning that the sign of\nF depends on the point of view. Electrical engineers and physicists use the minus\nsign. In mechanics the plus sign is more common. It is one of the ironies of fate that\nF D V\n1; while distance and velocity have those letters reversed: v D f\n1: Note the\nchange to capital letters and the change to x:\nFig. 8.16\nStretched spring; suitcase 20 feet up; moon of mass m; oscillating spring.\nEXAMPLE 2\nNewton's law of gravitation (inverse square law):\nforce to overcome gravity D GMm=x2\nforce exerted by gravity D\nGMm=x2\nAn engine pushes a rocket forward. Gravity pulls it back. The gravitational constant\nis G and the Earth's mass is M: The mass of the rocket or satellite or suitcase is m;\nand the potential is the indefinite integral:\nV.x/ D r\nF.x/ dx D\nGMm=x CC:\n(4)\nUsually C D 0; which makes the potential zero at x D\n8:\nRemark\nWhen carrying the suitcase upstairs, x changed by 20 feet. The weight\nwas regarded as constant--which it nearly is. But an exact calculation of work uses\nthe integral of F.x/; not just the multiplication 30 times 20: The serious difference\ncomes when the suitcase is carried to x D\n8: With constant force that requires infinite\nwork. With the correct (decreasing) force, the work equals V at infinity (which is zero)\nminus V at the pickup point x0: The change in V is W D GMm=x0:\n\nApplications of the Integral\nKINETIC ENERGY\nThis optional paragraph carries the physics one step further. Suppose you release the\nspring or drop the suitcase. The external force changes to F D 0: But the internal\nforce still acts on the spring, and gravity still acts on the suitcase. They both start\nmoving. The potential energy of the suitcase is converted to kinetic energy, until it\nhits the bottom of the stairs.\nTime enters the problem, either through Newton's law or Einstein's:\n.Newton/ F D ma D mdv\ndt\n.Einstein/ F D d\ndt .mv/:\n(5)\nHere we stay with Newton, and pretend the mass is constant. Exercise 21 follows\nEinstein; the mass increases with velocity. There m D m0=\na\nv2=c2 goes to\ninfinity as v approaches c; the speed of light. That correction comes from the\ntheory of relativity, and is not needed for suit-cases.\nWhat happens as the suitcase falls ? From x D a at the top of the stairs to x D b\nat the bottom, potential energy is lost. But kinetic energy 1\n2mv2 is gained, as we see\nfrom integrating Newton's law:\nforce F D mdv\ndt D mdv\ndx\ndx\ndt D mv dv\ndx\nwork\n» b\na\nF dx D\n» b\na\nmv dv\ndx dx D 1\n2mv2.b/\n2mv2.a/:\n(6)\nThis same force F is given by\ndV=dx: So the work is also the change in V :\nwork\n» b\na\nF dx D\n» b\na\n\ndV\ndx\n\ndx D\nV.b/CV.a/:\n(7)\nSince (6) D (7), the total energy 1\n2mv2 CV (kinetic plus potential) is constant:\n2mv2.b/CV.b/ D 1\n2mv2.a/CV.a/:\n(8)\nThis is the law of conservation of energy. The total energy is conserved.\nEXAMPLE 3\nAttach a mass m to the end of a stretched spring and let go. The\nspring's\nenergy V D 1\n2kx2 is gradually converted to kinetic energy of the mass. At x D 0 the\nchange to kinetic energy is complete: the original 1\n2kx2 has become 1\n2mv2: Beyond\nx D 0 the potential energy increases, the force reverses sign and pulls back, and\nkinetic energy is lost. Eventually all energy is potential--when the mass reaches the\nother extreme. It is simple harmonic motion, exactly as in Chapter 1 (where the mass\nwas the shadow of a circling ball). The equation of motion is the statement that the\nrate of change of energy is zero (and we cancel v D dx=dt):\nd\ndt\n2mv2 C 1\n2kx2\n\nD mvdv\ndt Ckx dx\ndt D 0\nor\nmd 2x\ndt2 Ckx D 0:\n(9)\nThat is F D ma in disguise. For a spring, the solution x D cos\n?k=mt will be found\nin this book. For more complicated structures, engineers spend a billion dollars a year\ncomputing the solution.\n\n8.6\nForce, Work, and Energy\nPRESSURE AND HYDROSTATIC FORCE\nOur forces have been concentrated at a single points. That is not the case for\npressure. A fluid exerts a force all over the base and sides of its container. Suppose a\nwater tank or swimming pool has constant depth h (in meters or feet). The water has\nweight-density w\n9800 N=m3\n62 lb=ft3: On the base, the pressure is w times h:\nThe force is wh times the base area A W\nF D whA (pounds or Newtons)\np D F=A D wh.lb=ft2 or N=m2/:\n(10)\nThus pressure is force per unit area. Here p and F are computed by multiplication,\nbecause the depth h is constant. Pressure is proportional to depth (as divers know).\nDown the side wall, h varies and we need calculus.\nThe pressure on the side is still wh--the same in all directions.

      "content": "CHAPTER 9\nPolar Coordinates and\nComplex Numbers\n9.1 Polar Coordinates\nUp to now, points have been located by their x and y coordinates. But if you were\na flight controller, and a plane appeared on the screen, you would not give its\nposition that way. Instead of x and y, you would read off the direction of the plane\nand its distance. The direction is given by an angle : The distance is given by a\npositive number r: Those are the polar coordinates of the point, where x and y are\nthe rectangular coordinates.\nThe angle is measured from the horizontal. Suppose the distance is 2 and\nthe direction is 30\nor =6 (degrees preferred by flight controllers, radians by\nmathematicians). A pilot looking along the x axis would give the plane's direction\nas \"11 o'clock.\" This totally destroys our system of units, by measuring direction in\nhours. But the angle and the distance locate the plane.\nHow far to a landing strip at r D 1 and D\n=2 ? For that question polar\ncoordinates are not good. They are perfect for distance from the origin (which equals\nr), but for most other distances I would switch to x and y: It is extremely simple\nto determine x and y from r and , and we will do it constantly. The most used\nformulas in this chapter come from Figure 9.1--where the right triangle has angle\nand hypotenuse r: The sides of that triangle are x and y:\nx D r cos\nand\ny D r sin :\n(1)\nThe point at r D 2; D =6 has x D 2 cos.=6/ and y D 2sin.=6/: The cosine of\n=6 is\n?\n3=2 and the sine is 1\n2: So x D\n?\n3 and y D 1: Polar coordinates convert\neasily to xy coordinates--now we go the other way.\nAlways x2 Cy2 D r2: In this example .\n?\n3/2 C.1/2 D .2/2: Pythagoras produces\nr from x and y: The direction is also available, but the formula is not so beautiful:\nr D\na\nx2 Cy2\nand\ntan D y\nx\nand .almost/\nD tan\n1 y\nx :\n(2)\nOur point has y=x D 1=\n?\n3: One angle with this tangent is D tan\n1.1=\n?\n3/ D =6:\n\n9.1\nPolar Coordinates\nFig. 9.1\nPolar coordinates r; and rectangular coordinates x D r cos ;y D r sin :\nEXAMPLE 1\nPoint B in Figure 9.1c is at a negative angle D\n=4: The x\ncoordinate r cos. =4/ is the same as r cos =4 (the cosine is even). But the y\ncoordinate r sin. =4/ is negative. Computing r and from x D 1 and y D 1, the\ndistance is r D\n?\n1C1 and tan is\n1=1:\nWarning To any angle we can add or subtract 2--which goes a full 360\ncircle\nand keeps the same direction. Thus\n=4 or\nis the same angle as 7=4 or\n: So is 15=4 or 675\n:\nIf we add or subtract 180\n, the tangent doesn't change. The point .1;\n1/ is on the\nline at r D\n?\n2: The point . 1;1/ is on the 135\nline also with r D\n?\n2: Both\nhave tan D\n1: We had to write \"almost\" in equation (2), because a point has many\n's and two points have the same r and tan :\nEven worse, we could say that B D .1;\n1/ is on the 135\nline but at a negative\ndistance r D\n\n?\n2: A negative r carries the point backward along the 135\nline,\nwhich is forward to B: In giving the position of B, I would always keep r\n¡ 0: But\nin drawing the graph of a polar equation, r\n0 is allowed. We move now to those\ngraphs.\nTHE CIRCLE r D cos\nThe basis for Chapters 1-8 was y D f .x/: The key to this chapter is r D F./: That\nis a relation between the polar coordinates, and the points satisfying an equation like\nr D cos produce a polar graph.\nIt is not obvious why r D cos gives a circle. The equations r D cos 2 and\nr D cos2 and r D 1Ccos produce entirely different graphs--not circles. The\ndirect approach is to take D 0\n;30\n;60\n; ::: and go out the distance r D cos on\neach ray. The points are marked in Figure 9.2a, and connected into a curve. It seems\nto be a circle of radius 1\n2, with its center at the point . 1\n2;0/: We have to be able to\nshow mathematically that r D cos represents a shifted circle.\nOne point must be mentioned. The angles from 0 to give the whole circle. The\nnumber r D cos becomes negative after =2, and we go backwards along each ray.\nFig. 9.2\nThe circle r D cos and the switch to x and y: The circle r D sin:\n\nPolar Coordinates and Complex Numbers\nAt D (to the left of the origin) the cosine is\n1: Going backwards brings us\nto the same point as D 0 and r D C1--which completes the circle.\nWhen continues from to 2 we go around again. The polar equation gives the\ncircle twice. (Or more times, when continues past 2:) If you don't like negative\nr's and multiple circles, restrict to the range from\n=2 to =2: We still have to\nsee why the graph of r D cos is a circle.\nMethod 5 Multiply by r and convert to rectangular coordinates x and y:\nr D cos\nn\nr2 D r cos\nn\nx2 Cy2 D x:\n(3)\nThis is a circle because of x2 Cy2: From rewriting as .x\n2/2 Cy2 D . 1\n2/2 we\nrecognize its center and radius. Center at x D 1\n2 and y D 0; radius 1\n2: Done.\nMethod 6 Write x and y separately as functions of : Then is a \"parameter\":\nx D r cos D cos2\nand\ny D r sin D sin cos :\n(4)\nThese are not polar equations but parametric equations. The parameter is the\nangle, but it could be the time--the curve would be the same. Chapter 12 studies\nparametric equations in detail--here we stay with the circle.\nTo find the circle, square x and y and add. This produces x2 Cy2 D x in Problem\n26: But here we do something new: Start with the circle and find equation (4). In\ncase you don't reach Chapter 12, the idea is this. Add the vectors OC to the center\nand CP out the radius:\nThe point P in Figure 9.2 has .x;y/ D OC CCP D . 1\n2;0/C. 1\n2 cos t; 1\n2 sin t/:\nThe parameter t is the angle at the center of the circle. The equations are\nx D 1\n2 C 1\n2 cos t and y D 1\n2 sin t: A trigonometric person sees a double angle and sets\nt D 2: The result is equation (4) for the circle:\nx D 1\n2 C 1\n2 cos 2 D cos2\nand\ny D 1\n2 sin 2 D sin cos :\n(5)\nThis step rediscovers a basic theorem of geometry: The angle t at the center is twice\nthe angle at the circumference. End of quick introduction to parameters.\nA second circle is r D sin , drawn in Figure 9.2c. A third circle is r D cos C\nsin , not drawn. Problem 27 asks you to find its xy equation and its radius. All\ncalculations go back to x D r cos and y D r sin --the basic facts of polar\ncoordinates! The last exercise shows a parametric equation with beautiful graphs,\nbecause it may be possible to draw them now. Then the next section concentrates on\nr D F./--and goes far beyond circles.\n9.1\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nPolar coordinates r and correspond to x D\na\nand y D\nb\n.\nThe points with r\n¡ 0 and D are located\nc\n. The points with\nr D 1 and 0\n¤\n¤ are located\nd\n. Reversing the sign of\nmoves the point .x;y/ to\ne\n.\nGiven x and y, the polar distance is r D\nf\n. The tangent of\nis\ng\n.

The equation looks too easy, but that is the point! The graph is a circle\naround the origin (the unit circle). Compare with the line x D 1: More important,\ncompare the simplicity of r D 1 with the complexity of y D\n\n?\nx2: Circles are\nso common in applications that they created the need for polar coordinates.\nThis section studies polar curves r D F./: The cardioid is a sentimental favorite--\nmaybe parabolas are more practical. The cardioid is r D 1Ccos ; the parabola is\nr D 1=.1Ccos /: Section 12.2 adds cycloids and astroids. A graphics package can\ndraw them and so can we.\nTogether with the circles r D constant go the straight lines D constant. The\nequation D =4 is a ray out from the origin, at that fixed angle. If we allow r\n0;\nas we do in drawing graphs, the one-directional ray changes to a full line. Important:\nThe circles are perpendicular to the rays. We have \"orthogonal coordinates\"--\nmore interesting than the x\ny grid of perpendicular lines. In principle x could be\nmixed with (non-orthogonal), but in practice that never happens.\nOther curves are attractive in polar coordinates--we look first at five examples.\nSometimes we switch back to x D r cos and y D r sin ; to recognize the graph.\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe graph of r D 1=cos is the straight line x D 1 (because r cos D 1).\nEXAMPLE 2\nThe graph of r D cos 2 is the four-petal flower in Figure 9.3.\nThe points at D 30\nand\nand 150\nand\nare marked on the flower.\nThey all have r D cos 2 D 1\n2: There are three important symmetries--across the\nx axis, across the y axis, and through the origin. This four-petal curve has them\nall. So does the vertical flower r D sin2--but surprisingly, the tests it passes are\ndifferent.\n(Across the x axis: y to\ny)\nThere are two ways to cross. First, change to\n:\nThe equation r D cos 2 stays the same. Second, change to\nand also r to\nr: The equation r D sin2 stays the same. Both flowers have x axis symmetry.\n(Across the y axis: x to\nx)\nThere are two ways to cross. First, change to\n:\nThe equation r D cos 2 stays the same. Second, change to\nand r to\nr: Now\nr D sin2 stays the same (the sine is odd). Both curves have y axis symmetry.\n(Through the origin)\nNow we change r to\nr or to C: The flower equations\npass the second test only: cos 2. C/ D cos 2 and sin2. C/ D sin2: Every\nequation r2 D F./ passes the first test, since . r/2 D r2.\nThe circle r D cos has x axis symmetry, but not y or r: The spiral r D 3 has\ny axis symmetry, because\nr D . /3 is the same equation.\nQuestion What happens if you change r to\nr and also change to C ?\nAnswer\nNothing--because .r;/ and . r; C/ are always the same point.\nEXAMPLE 3\nThe graph of r D is a spiral of Archimedes--or maybe two spi-\nrals.\nThe spiral adds new points as increases past 2: Our other examples are\n\"periodic\"-- D 2 gives the same point as D 0: A periodic curve repeats itself.\nThe spiral moves out by 2 each time it comes around. If we allow negative angles\nand negative r D ; a second spiral appears.\n\n9.2\nPolar Equations and Graphs\nFig. 9.3\nThe four-petal flower r D cos 2 and the spiral r D (r\n¡ 0 in red).\nEXAMPLE 4\nThe graph of r D 1Ccos is a cardioid. It is drawn in Figure 9.4c.\nThe cardioid has no simple xy equation. Still the curve is very attractive. It has a\ncusp at the origin and it is heart-shaped (hence its name). To draw it, plot r D 1C\ncos at 30\nintervals and connect the points. For this curve r is never negative, since\ncos never goes below\n1:\nIt is a curious fact that the electrical vector in your heart almost traces out a\ncardioid. See Section 11.1 about electrocardiograms. If it is a perfect cardioid you\nare in a little trouble.\nFig. 9.4\nLimacons r D 1Cb cos ; including a cardioid and Mars seen from Earth.\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe graph of r D 1Cb cos is a limacon (a cardioid when b D 1).\nLimacon (soft c) is a French word for snail--not so well known as escargot but just\nas inedible. (I am only referring to the shell. Excusez-moi!) Figure 9.4 shows how a\ndimple appears as b increases. Then an inner loop appears beyond b D 1 (the cardioid\nat b D 1 is giving birth to a loop). For large b the curve looks more like two circles.\nThe limiting case is a double circle, when the inner loop is the same as the outer loop.\nRemember that r D cos goes around the circle twice.\nWe could magnify the limacon by a factor c; changing to r D c.1Cb cos /: We\ncould rotate 180\nto r D 1\nb cos : But the real interest is whether these figures\narise in applications, and Donald Saari showed me a nice example.\n\nPolar Coordinates and Complex Numbers\nMars seen from Earth The Earth goes around the Sun and so does Mars. Roughly\nspeaking Mars is 1 1\n2 times as far out, and completes its orbit in two Earth years.\nWe take the orbits as circles: r D 2 for Earth and r D 3 for Mars. Those equations\ntell where but not when. With time as a parameter, the coordinates of Earth and Mars\nare given at every instant t:\nxE D 2 cos 2t;yE D 2 sin2t\nand\nxM D 3 cos t;yM D 3 sin t:\nAt t D 1 year, the Earth completes a circle (angle D 2) and Mars is halfway.\nNow the key step. Subtract to find the position of Mars relative to Earth:\nxME D 3 cos t\n2 cos 2t\nand\nyME D 3 sin t\n2 sin 2t:\nReplacing cos 2t by 2cos2t\n1 and sin 2t by 2 sin t cos t; this is\nxME D .3\n4 cos t/cos t C2\nand\nyME D .3\n4 cos t/sin t:\nSeen from the Earth, Mars does a loop in the sky! There are two t's for which\n4cos t D 0 (or cos t D 3\n4). At both times, Mars is two units from Earth\n(xME D 2 and yME D 0). When we move the origin to that point, the 2 is\nsubtracted away--the M\nE coordinates become x D r cos t and y D r sin t with\nr D 3\n4cos t: That is a limacon with a loop, like Figure 9.4d.\nNote added in proof I didn't realize that a 3-to-2 ratio is also responsible for heating\nup two spots on opposite sides of Mercury. From the newspaper of June 13; 1990:\n\"Astronomers today reported the first observations showing that Mercury\nhas two extremely hot spots. That is because Mercury, the planet closest to the\nSun, turns on its axis once every 59:6 days, which is a day on Mercury. It goes\naround the sun every 88 days, a Mercurian year. With this 3-to-2 ratio between\nspin and revolution, the Sun appears to stop in the sky and move backward,\ndescribing a loop over each of the hot spots.\"\nCONIC SECTIONS IN POLAR COORDINATES\nThe exercises include other polar curves, like lemniscates and 200-petal flowers. But\nget serious. The most important curves are the ellipse and parabola and hyperbola.\nIn Section 3.5 their equations involved 1;x;y;x2;xy;y2: With one focus at the ori-\ngin, their polar equations are even better.\n9A The graph of r D A=.1Cecos / is a conic section with \"eccentricity\" e:\ncircle if e D 0\nellipse if 0\ne\nparabola if e D 1\nhyperbola if e\n¡ 1:\nEXAMPLE 6\n.e D 1/ The graph of r D 1=.1Ccos / is a parabola. This equation\nis r Cr cos D 1 or r D 1\nx: Squaring both sides gives x2 Cy2 D 1\n2x Cx2:\nCanceling x2 leaves y2 D 1\n2x; the parabola in Figure 9.5b.\nThe amplifying factor A blows up all curves, with no change in shape.\nEXAMPLE 7\n.e D 2/ The same steps lead from r.1C2cos / D 1 to r D 1\n2x:\nSquaring gives x2 Cy2 D 1\n4x C4x2 and the x2 terms do not cancel. Instead we\nhave y2\n3x2 D 1\n4x: This is the hyperbola in Figure 9.5c, with a focus at .0;0/:\nThe hyperbola y2\n3x2 D 1 (without the\n4x) has its center at .0;0/.\n\n9.2\nPolar Equations and Graphs\nEXAMPLE 8\n.e D 1\n2/ The same steps lead from r.1C 1\n2 cos / D 1 to r D 1\n2x:\nSquaring gives the ellipse x2 Cy2 D 1\nx C 1\n4x2: Polar equations look at conics in\na new way, which happens to match the sun and planets perfectly. The sun at .0;0/\nis not the center of the system, but a focus.\nFinally e D 0 gives the circle r D 1: Center of circle D both foci D .0;0/.\nFig. 9.5\nr D 1=.1Cecos ) is an ellipse for e D 1\n2; a parabola for e D 1; a hyperbola for\ne D 2.\nThe directrix The figure shows the line d (the \"directrix\") for each curve. All points\nP on the curve satisfy r D\n|PF\n| D e\n|Pd\n|: The distance to the focus is e times the\ndistance to the directrix. (e is still the eccentricity, nothing to do with exponentials.)\nA geometer would start from this property r D e\n|Pd\n| and construct the curve. We\nderive the property from the equation:\nr D\nA\n1Cecos\nn\nr Cex D A\nn\nr D e\nA\ne\nx\n\n:\n(1)\nThe directrix is the line at x D A=e: That last equation is exactly\n|PF\n| D e\n|Pd\n|.\nNotice how two numbers determine these curves. Here the numbers are A and e: In\nSection 3.5 they were a and b: (The ellipse was x2=a2 Cy2=b2 D 1:) Using A and\ne we go smoothly from ellipses through parabolas (at e D 1) and on to hyperbolas.\nWith three more numbers we can move the focus to any point and rotate the curve\nthrough any angle. Conics are determined by five numbers.\n9.2\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe circle of radius 3 around the origin has polar equation\na\n. The 45\nline has polar equation\nb\n.

There was no calculus! We now tackle the problems of area (integral calculus)\nand slope (differential calculus), when the equation is r D F./. The use of F instead\nof f is a reminder that the slope is not dF=d and the area is not r\nF./d.\nStart with area. The region is always divided into small pieces--what is their\nshape? Look between the angles and C in Figure 9.6a. Inside the curve is a\nnarrow wedge--almost a triangle, with as its small angle. If the radius is constant\nFig. 9.6\nArea of a wedge and a circle and an intersection of circles.\nthe wedge is a sector of a circle. It is a piece of pie cut at the extremely narrow angle\n. The area of that piece is a fraction (the angle divided by the whole angle 2)\nof the whole area r2 of the circle:\narea of wedge D\n2 r2 D 1\n2r2 D 1\n2 ŒF./2 :\n(1)\nWe admit that the exact shape is not circular. The true radius F./ varies with --\nbut in a narrow angle that variation is small. When we add up the wedges and let\napproach zero, the area becomes an integral.\n9B The area inside the polar curve rDF./ is the limit of P 1\n2r2 DP 1\n2F 2:\narea D\n» 1\n2 r2 d D\n» 1\n2 ŒF./2 d:\n(2)\nEXAMPLE 1\nFind the area inside the circle r D cos of radius 1\n2 (Figure 9.6).\narea D\n» 2\n2 cos2 d D cos sin C\nD 2\n4 :\nThat is wrong!

What is the slope at\nD =4 ? Those are not the most important questions in calculus, but still we should\nknow how to answer them. I will describe the method quickly, by switching to\nrectangular coordinates:\nx D r cos D .1Ccos /cos\nand\ny D r sin D .1Ccos /sin :\nFor the highest point, maximize y by setting its derivative to zero:\ndy=d D .1Ccos /.cos /C. sin /.sin / D 0:\n(3)\nThus cos Ccos 2 D 0, which happens at 60\n.

Starting from x2 C4, its integral\n3x3 C4x CC is also real. If we are given x3\n1, its derivative 3x2 is real. But the\nroots (or zeros) of those polynomials are complex numbers:\nx2 C4 D 0\nand\nx3\n1 D 0\nhave complex solutions:\nWe expect two square roots of\n4. There are three cube roots of 1. Complex numbers\nare unavoidable, in order to find n roots for each polynomial of degree n.\nThis section explains how to work with complex numbers. You will see their\nrelation to polar coordinates. At the end, we use them to solve differential equations.\nStart with the imaginary number i. Everybody knows that x2 D\n1 has no real\nsolution. When you square a real number, the result is never negative. So the world has\nagreed on a solution called i. (Except that electrical engineers call it j .) Imaginary\nnumbers follow the normal rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,\nwith one difference: Whenever i2 appears it is replaced by\n1. In particular\ni\ntimes\ni gives Ci2 D\n1. In other words,\ni is also a square root of\n1. There are\ntwo solutions .i and\ni/ to the equation x2 C1 D 0.\nFinding cube roots of 1 will stretch us further. We need complex numbers--real\nplus imaginary.\n9B A complex number (say 1C3i) is the sum of a real number .1/ and a pure\nimaginary number .3i/. Addition keeps those parts separate; multiplication uses\ni2 D\n1:\nAddition W\n.1C3i/C.1C3i/ D 1C1Ci.3C3/ D 2C6i\nMultiplication W\n.1C3i/.1C3i/ D 1C3iC3i C9i 2 D\n8C6i:\nAdding 1C3i to 5\ni is easy .6C2i/. Multiplying is longer, but you see the rules:\n.1C3i/.5\ni/ D 5C15i\ni\n3i2 D 8C14i:\nThe point is this: We don't have to imagine any more new numbers. After accepting\ni, the rest is straightforward. A real number is just a complex number with no\nimaginary part! When 1C3i combines with its \"complex conjugate\" 1\n3i--adding\nor multiplying--the answer is real:\n.1C3i/C.1\n3i/D 2\n(real)\n.1C3i/.1\n3i/D 1\n3i C3i\n9i 2 D 10:\n(real)\n(1)\nThe complex conjugate offers a way to do division, by making the denominator real:\n1C3i D\n1C3i\n3i\n3i D 1\n3i\nand\nx Ciy D\nx Ciy\nx\niy\nx\niy D x\niy\nx2 Cy2 :\n9C The complex number x Ciy has real part x and imaginary part y. Its\ncomplex conjugate is x\niy. The product .x Ciy/.x\niy/ equals x2 Cy2 D r2.\nThe absolute value (or modulus) is r D\n|x Ciy\n| D\na\nx2 Cy2.\n\nPolar Coordinates and Complex Numbers\nTHE COMPLEX PLANE\nComplex numbers correspond to points in a plane. The number 1C3i corre-\nsponds to the point .1;3/. Similarly x Ciy is paired with .x;y/--which is x units\nalong the \"real axis\" and y units up the \"imaginary axis.\" The ordinary plane turns\ninto the complex plane. The absolute value r is the same as the polar coordinate r\n(Figure 9.8a).\nThe figure shows two more copies of the complex plane. The one in the middle\nis for addition and subtraction. It uses rectangular coordinates. The one on the right\nis for multiplication and division and squaring. It uses polar coordinates. In squaring\na complex number, r is squared and is doubled--as the right figure and equation (3)\nboth show.\nFig. 9.8\nThe complex plane shows x, y, r, . Add with x and y, multiply with r and .\nAdding complex numbers is like adding vectors (Chapter 11). The real parts give\n1 and the imaginary parts give 1C1. The vector sum .2;2/ corresponds to the\ncomplex sum 2C2i. The complex conjugate 3\ni is the mirror image across the real\naxis .i reversed to\ni/. The connection to r and is the same as before (you see it in\nthe triangle):\nx D r cos\nand\ny D r sin\nso that\nx Ciy D r.cos Ci sin /:\n(2)\nIn the third figure, 1Ci has r D\n?\n2 and D =4.

Its polar form is 2 cos =2C2i sin =2.\n9D Multiplication adds angles, division subtracts angles, and squaring doubles\nangles. The absolute values are multiplied, divided, and squared:\n.r cos Cir sin /2 D r2 cos 2 Cir2 sin 2:\n(3)\nFor nth powers we reach rn and n. For square roots, r goes to\n?r and goes to\n2. The number\n1 is at 180\n, so its square root i is at 90\n.\nTo see why is doubled in equation (3), factor out r2 and multiply as usual:\n.cos Ci sin /.cos Ci sin / D cos2\nsin2 C2i sin cos :\nThe right side is cos 2 Ci sin 2. The double-angle formulas from trigonometry\nmatch the squaring of complex numbers. The cube would be cos 3 Ci sin 3\n(because 2\nand\nadd to 3, and r\nis still 1). The nth power is in\nde Moivre's formula:\n.cos Ci sin /n D cos n Ci sin n:\n(4)\n\n9.4\nComplex Numbers\nWith n D\n1 we get cos. /Ci sin. /--which is cos\ni sin , the complex\nconjugate:\ncos Ci sin D\ncos Ci sin\ncos\ni sin\ncos\ni sin D cos\ni sin\n:\n(5)\nWe are almost touching Euler's formula, the key to all numbers on the unit circle:\nEuler's formula :\ncos Ci sin D ei:\n(6)\nSquaring both sides gives .ei/.ei/ D e2i. That is equation (3). The\n1 power\nis 1=ei D e\ni. That is equation (5). Multiplying any ei by ei produces ei.C/.\nThe special case D gives the square, and the special case D\ngives eie\ni D\n1.\nEuler's formula appeared in Section 6.7, by changing x to i in the series for ex:\nex D 1Cx C x2\n2 C x3\n6 C\n\nbecomes\nei D 1Ci\ni 3\n6 C\n\n:\nA highlight of Chapter 10 is to recognize two new series on the right. The real terms\n2 2 C\n\nadd up to cos . The imaginary part\n6 3 C\n\nadds up to sin .\nTherefore ei equals cos Ci sin . It is fantastic that the most important periodic\nfunctions in all of mathematics come together in this graceful way.\nWe learn from Euler (pronounced oiler) that e2i D 1. The cosine of 2 is 1, the\nsine is zero. If you substitute x D 2i into the infinite series, somehow everything\ncancels except the 1--this is almost a miracle. From the viewpoint of angles, D 2\ncarries us around a full circle and back to e2i D 1.\nMultiplying Euler's formula by r, we have a third way to write a complex number:\nEvery complex number is\nx Ciy D r cos Cir sin D rei:\n(7)\nEXAMPLE 1\n2ei times 3ei equals 6e2i. For D =2, 2i times 3i is\n6.\nEXAMPLE 2\nFind w2 and w4 and w8 and w25 when w D ei=4.\nSolution\nei=4 is 1=\n?\n2Ci=\n?\n2. Note that r2 D 1\n2 C 1\n2 D 1. Now watch angles:\nw2 D ei=2 D i\nw4 D ei D\nw8 D 1\nw25 D w8w8w8w D w:\nFigure 9.9 shows the eight powers of w. They are the eighth roots of 1.\nFig. 9.9\nThe eight powers of w and the cube roots of 1.\nEXAMPLE 3\n.x2 C4 D 0/ The square roots of\n4 are 2i and\n2i. Instead of\n.i/.i/ D\n1 we have .2i/.2i/ D\n4. If Euler insists, we write 2i and\n2i as 2ei=2\nand 2ei3=2.\n\nPolar Coordinates and Complex Numbers\nEXAMPLE 4\n(The cube roots of 1) In rectangular coordinates we have to\nsolve .x Ciy/3 D 1, which is not easy. In polar coordinates this same equation is\nr3e3i D 1. Immediately r D 1. The angle can be 2=3 or 4=3 or 6=3--the\ncube roots in the figure are evenly spaced:\n.e2i=3/3 D e2i D 1\n.e4i=3/3 D e4i D 1\n.e6i=3/3 D e6i D 1:\nYou see why the angle 8=3 gives nothing new. It completes a full circle back to\n2=3.\nThe nth roots of 1 are e2i=n, e4i=n, :::, 1. There are n of them.\nThey lie at angles 2=n, 4=n, :::, 2 around the unit circle.\nSOLUTION OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\nThe algebra of complex numbers is now applied to the calculus of complex functions.\nThe complex number is c, the complex function is ect. It will solve the equations\ny\n2 D\n4y and y\n3 D y, by connecting them to c2 D\n4 and c3 D 1. Chapter 16 does\nthe same for all linear differential equations with constant coefficients--this is an\noptional preview.\nPlease memorize the one key idea: Substitute y D ect into the differential equa-\ntion and solve for c. Each derivative brings a factor c, so y\n1 D cect and y\n2 D c2ect:\nd 2y=dt2 D\n4y leads to c2ect D\n4ect; which gives c2 D\n4:\n(8)\nFor this differential equation, c must be a square root of\n4. We know the candidates\n.c D 2i and c D\n2i/. The equation has two \"pure exponential solutions\" ect:\ny D e2it\nand\ny D e\n2it:\n(9)\nTheir combinations y D Ae2it CBe\n2it give all solutions. In Chapter 16 we will\nchoose the two numbers A and B to match two initial conditions at t D 0.\nThe solution y D e2it D cos 2t Ci sin 2t is complex. The differential equation is\nreal. For real y's, take the real and imaginary parts of the complex solutions:\nyreal D cos 2t and yimaginary D sin 2t:\n(10)\nThese are the \"pure oscillatory solutions.\" When y D e2it travels around the\nunit circle, its imaginary part sin 2t moves up and down. (It is like the ball and its\nshadow in Section 1.4, but twice as fast because of 2t.) The real part cos 2t goes\nbackward and forward. By the chain rule, the second derivative of cos 2t is\n4cos 2t.\nThus d 2y=dt2 D\n4y and we have real solutions.\nEXAMPLE 5\nFind three solutions and then three real solutions to d 3y=dt3 D y.\nKey step: Substitute y D ect. The result is c3ect D ect. Thus c3 D 1 and c is a cube\nroot of 1. The candidate c D 1 gives y D et (our first solution). The next c is complex:\nc D e2i=3 D\n2 Ci\n?\nyields\ny D ect D e\nt=2ei\n?\n3t=2:\n(11)\nThe real part of the exponent leads to the absolute value\n|y\n| D e\nt=2. It decreases\nas t gets larger, so y moves toward zero. At the same time, the factor ei\n?\n3t=2 goes\naround the unit circle. Thereforey spirals in to zero (Figure 9.10). So does its complex\n\n9.4\nComplex Numbers\nconjugate, which is the third exponential. Changing i to\ni in (11) gives the third\ncube root of 1 and the third solution e\nt=2e\ni\n?\n3t=2.\nThe first real solution is y D et. The others are the two parts of the spiral:\nyreal D e\nt=2 cos\n?\n3t=2\nand\nyimaginary D e\nt=2 sin\n?\n3t=2:\n(12)\nThat is r cos and r sin . It is the ultimate use (until Chapter 16) of polar coordinates\nand complex numbers. We might have discovered cos 2t and sin 2t without help, for\ny\n2 D\n4y. I don't think these solutions to y\n3 D y would have been found.\nEXAMPLE 6\nFind four solutions to d 4y=dt4 D y by substituting y D ect.\nFour derivatives lead to c4 D 1. Therefore c is i or\n1 or\ni or 1. The solutions are\ny D eit, e\nt, e\nit, and et. If we want real solutions, eit and e\nit combine into cos t\nand sin t. In all cases y\n2 D y.\nFig. 9.10\nSolutions move in the complex plane: y\n2 D\n4y and y\n3 D y and y\n2 D y.\n9.4\nEXERCISES\nRead-through questions\nThe complex number 3C4i has real part\na\nand imagi-\nnary part\nb\n.
