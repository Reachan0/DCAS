      "content": "9.14 Homework 1, due before Lecture 6.\nClasses 1-5\n\n1) What functions could be served by axons with many boutons en passant?\nDescribe two possibilities. (Ch 1)\n\n2) Give two examples of behavior patterns that a reflex model of behavior (or, more\nbroadly, an S-R model) cannot adequately explain. (Ch 2)\n\n3) What is the axons-of-passage problem one must deal with when using stains for\naxon degeneration for the tracing of axonal pathways and connections? What\naxon tracing technique overcomes this problem? (Ch 2)\n\n4) Do web searches to find evidence of a very primitive chordate that is more\nadvanced than amphioxus but less advanced than animals resembling lampreys\nand hagfish. Try searching for \"Haikouella.\" Fossils of this species were found in\nChina in recent years. Write a one-paragraph description noting similarities to,\nand differences from, the lancelots (amphioxus). You can find pictures using\nGoogle, and scientific reports using Google Scholar. (Ch 3)\n\n5) Do web searches for information on the brains of cynodonts (mammal-like\nreptiles, the group from which the earliest mammals evolved). Write one or two\nparagraphs on findings of interest, using papers found using Google Scholar.\nDescribe only major points. Start by explaining how a fossil skull can tell us\nanything about the brain. (Ch 3)\n\n6) Describe the three major expansions of the vertebrate forebrain depicted in\nchapter 4.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.14 Brain Structure and Its Origins\nSpring 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "9.14 Homework 2, due before Lecture 9.\nClasses 5-8\n\n1) Draw a dorsal view of an embryonic CNS, simplified as in classes. Repeat the\ndrawing two more times. On the drawings, add three axons of the spinothalamic\ntract (one on each drawing): one from the lumbar cord, the second from the mid-\nthoracic cord, and the third from the cervical cord. Show the first reaching the\nhindbrain reticular formation (and not beyond), show the second reaching the\nmidbrain reticular formation (and not beyond), and show the third reaching the\ncaudal thalamus. Next, answer the following questions:\na. What region of body surface could be stimulated to activate the first\ntype of axon?\nb. What region could be stimulated to activate the second type of axon?\nc. What region could be stimulated to activate the third type of axon?\nd. If you were to draw an axon of the spinoreticular tract, what would be\nthe major difference from the axons of the spinothalamic tract?\n\n2) The snakes known as pit vipers have an ability to detect the location of sources of\ninfrared radiation. Describe the location of the sensory receptors. How does this\nability help these snakes? Which nerve innervates these receptors? A pathway\nfrom the secondary sensory neurons activated by this nerve can be followed to a\nstructure in the midbrain (via one more synapse). What does that midbrain\nstructure control, in response to the infrared radiation detection?\n\n3) What are the barrel fields? Name some species that have them.\n\n4) Describe a quantitative difference in brain lesion effects, contrasting a monkey, a\nrat and a frog. For two of these species, what would constitute a qualitative\ndifference in brain function?\n\n5) Why does sensory information from the body surface traveling through the dorsal\ncolumn-medial lemniscus pathway reach the neocortex faster than sensory\ninformation traveling through the spinothalamic tract? Answer by describing at\nleast two factors that are different in the two pathways.\n\n6) Describe specific events in either gastrulation or neurulation that involve the\nbasic cellular activities described by Wolpert (see chapter 8). Cite at least three\nof those cellular activities.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.14 Brain Structure and Its Origins\nSpring 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "9.14 Homework 4\ndue before Lecture 18.\n\nKEY\n\nWrite brief answers to as many of the following questions as you can. They are based on a\nreading of chapters 13-17 of the book Brain Structure and Its Origins.\n\n1) Contrast collateral sprouting of axons and regeneration of axons.\n\nRegeneration: re-growth, partial or complete, of a transected axon from, or near, the place the\naxon was transected.\n\nCollateral sprouting of an undamaged axon can occur in axonal arbors in response to\ndegeneration of endings of nearby axons. It can also occur in axonal endings of axons which\nhave suffered the loss of other terminal arbors. In either case, the sprouting may not be near\nthe site of damage.\n\n2) Describe membrane incorporation in growing axons.\n\nMembrane is transported down the growing axons from the cell bodies in the form of small\nvescicles, which fuse to the axonal membrane at the growth cone. This also occurs at swellings\nalong the axon.\n\n3) Study the model of a growth cone depicted in figure 13.3. Describe the dynamics of axon\ngrowth using the concepts of fundamental cellular events named by Lewis Wolpert (chapter\n8). [At least three of the concepts in bold font should be included in the answer.]\n\nFilopodia extend from the growth cone, with tips that contain cell adhesion molecules in the\nmembrane. The filopodia extend and contract back towards the growth cone. When the tips\nadhere to a substrate, the contraction pulls on the growth cone. The front edge of the growth\ncone is moved (pulled) in a direction determined by the vector sum of the forces created by all\nthe filopodia that are adhering to the substrate. The axon grows as the back of the growth cone\nforms the axonal trunk and the size of the growth cone is maintained by incorporation of\nmembrane of vescicles being transported in an anterograde direction from the cell body.\n\n4) What is the major conclusion that can be drawn from Hibbard's experiment on transplanted\namphibian Mauthner cells of the hindbrain? (I.e., what does his result mean?)\n\nHis result means that the substrate (the tissue of the hindbrain) contains a directional signal that\ndetermines the caudalward direction of growth of the axons of the Mauthner cells.\n\n5) What is the protein \"nogo\" and what might it mean for attempts to promote axonal\nregeneration in the mature central nervous system?\n\nNogo is a membrane protein in oligodendrocytes. The protein inhibits the growth of\naxons that contact it. Since oligodendrocyte membranes form myelin, the myelinated\naxons of the mature CNS can be expected to inhibit the growth of axons, thus inhibiting\nregeneration.\n\n9.14 Homework 4\ndue before Lecture 18.\n\nKEY\n6) Describe an example of selective repulsion of axon growth into a structure like the optic\ntectum. What molecules are involved in the case of the developing retinotectal connections?\n\nWhen axons from the temporal retina grow into the optic tectum from the rostral side,\nthey grow readily through the rostral half of the tectum but appear to be repelled from the\ncaudal half. Axons from the nasal retina are not repelled like this, since they grow into\nthe caudal half of the tectum.\n\nThe molecules involved are ephrins in the tectum and ephrin receptors in the retinal\nneurons and their axons (Eph receptors). Gradients of different ephrins and Eph receptors\nare found across the tectum and across the retina.\n\n7) Describe several of the factors that can influence the amount of collateral sprouting of axons.\nSeparate intrinsic and extrinsic factors.\n\nExtrinsic factors: Growth factors (like neurotrophin molecules), availability of vacant\nsynaptic space, electrical activity of the axons.\n\nIntrinsic factor: The growth vigor of the axon is affected not only by the above factors but\nalso by the total amount of end arbor the axon has formed (or the number of synapses it\nhas formed).\n\n8) Describe one method that has been used to elicit axonal regeneration in the CNS of adult\nanimals, with a return of function.\n\n- Short segments of peripheral nerve have been cut from the leg of the animal with a\nbrain lesion. These segments have been implanted so as to form bridges over the site\nof a transection of the optic tract. Axons that have been transected will grow into a\nperipheral nerve segment, supported by Schwann cells, grow across the bridge into\nthe denervated tissue on the other side where they are able to form functional\nsynapses.\n\n- A very small amount of a self-assembling peptide discovered at MIT has been\ninjected in water solution into the site of transection of the optic tract of hamsters.\nThe peptide self-assembles into a gel that acts as a scaffold that supports axonal\ngrowth, and the optic-tract axons will regrow across the wound and form functional\nterminations on the more caudal side.\n9) Contrast two types of initiation of movement by describing a specific example of locomotion\ninitiated from the hypothalamus and a specific example of locomotion initiated because of\nvisual input.\n\n- Food deprivation causes increase in activity of hypothalamic cells which correspond\nto a strong hunger drive. This initiates locomotion necessary for foraging activity.\n\n9.14 Homework 4\ndue before Lecture 18.\n\nKEY\n[Student may also mention increased activity in the hypothalamic locomotor area and\nthe midbrain locomotor area, but this is not essential for this part of an answer.]\n\n- A small mammal sees an overhead raptor that may be approaching. This activates\nsuperior colliculus neurons that activate a descending ipsilateral pathway that causes\nescape locomotion. [The student may also mention that the pathway goes to the\nmidbrain locomotor area.]\n10) How is locomotion modulated by activity in structures of the hindbrain, regardless of how\nthis locomotion was initiated? Name a descending pathway from the hindbrain whereby this\nmodulation is accomplished.\n\nLocomotion is modulated/ influenced by vestibular activity. Such activity activates axons\nof the vestibulospinal tract. [Student may also mention, or as an alternative describe, the\nfastigiospinal tract (cerebellospinal tract).]\n11) Contrast the structure of the red nucleus of the midbrain in two species: a rat and a monkey.\n\nThe red nucleus is made up of a rostral parvocellular component and a caudal\nmagnocellular component. In a monkey, the parvocellular component is much larger, and\nin a rat the magnocellular component is much larger.\n12) Contrast the nature of peripheral synapses in the somatic motor system and the autonomic\nnervous system.\n\n- In the somatic motor system, the axons of motor neurons make true synapses with\nstriated muscle fibers--each synapse affecting only one muscle fiber.\n- In the autonomic nervous system, an axon from an autonomic ganglion release its\nneurotransmitter less specifically when activated by action potentials, so that it affects\nmultiple smooth muscle fibers or multiple gland cells. This is called apocrine\nactivation rather than true synaptic activation.\n13) Many of the dexterous movements that depend on the corticospinal tract are learned\nmovements. How are innate movement patterns (fixed action patterns) different?\n\nFirst of all, innate movement patterns are largely unlearned. Secondly, dexterous\nmovements of an innate movement pattern may also use the corticospinal tract.\n14) How might many learned movements depend on spinal \"modules\" more than on direct\nconnections from cortex to motor neurons?\n\nMany movements activate spinal modules that cause a hand or foot to move to a\nparticular position in space. This simplifies learning to move the hand or foot to\n\n9.14 Homework 4\ndue before Lecture 18.\n\nKEY\nparticular places since the descending pathway simply has to activate a specific\ncombination of spinal modules. Activating each spinal neuron involved would require\nmuch more descending information, making the learning task more complex.\n15) Destruction of medial hindbrain pathways in monkeys can cause drastic effects on movement\nabilities. Why is it that when such lesions are inflicted unilaterally, there is usually little\neffect?\n\nThe remaining unilateral pathway has terminations in the spinal cord that reach the\ncontralateral as well as the ipsilateral side. Thus, there is redundancy in the pathways\ncontrolling the axial muscles, so an animal can quickly compensate for the loss of only\nthe right or only the left descending pathway.\n16) How can neuroanatomical experiments determine whether primary somatosensory cortex\noverlaps fully or partially with primary motor cortex?\n\nThe thalamic nucleus VL projects to the motor cortex, and the nucleus VP projects to the\nprimary somatosensory cortex. The anatomist can use either retrograde or anterograde\ntracing to find out how much, if any, of the projections from these two nuclei overlap in\nthe cortex.\n17) How do we know that the generation of rhythmic neural activity, by whatever means, can be\nused to generate any conceivable temporal pattern of activity?\n\nWe know this from the mathematics of Fourier analysis, in which a waveform of any\ncomplexity can be represented as a summation of different sine waves, of different\nfrequencies, phases, and amplitudes.\n\n18) What are two different types of mechanisms whereby the overall state of all or much of the\nbrain can be changed?\n\n1) Chemical secretions into the cerebrospinal fluid.\n2) Activation of a system of very widespread projections.\n\n19) How have changes in brain state been measured by the recording of electrical potentials?\n(This is not much discussed in the textbook.) Discuss the adequacy or inadequacy of such a\nmeasure.\n\n- Electroencephalograph recordings (EEG) show different rhythms and amplitudes\nwhen an human or animal is relaxed and quiet, wide awake and attending to novel\ninputs, drowsy, falling asleep, in deep sleep or in dream sleep.\n- Such recordings have not indicated the very large number of different brain states that\nthe known widespread axonal projections are capable of generating.\n\n9.14 Homework 4\ndue before Lecture 18.\n\nKEY\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.14 Brain Structure and Its Origins\nSpring 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

See the medial view of\nthe human cerebral hemisphere on the next slide.\n\nSensory-\nPerceptual\nMotor\nBehavior\nMotivation\nMajor functional modules\nof the CNS\nLateral\nview\nMedial\nview\nBrainstem,\nsagittal section\nCourtesy of MIT Press.

The limbic midbrain areas were\ndefined by Nauta (1950s & 1960s) from neuroanatomical studies.\n\nFig 11-4\nSomatic regions: arousal type 1\nLimbic regions: arousal type 2\nCourte\n\nsy o f MIT Press.

Different effects of activation, according to\nresults of electrical stimulation experiments.\n2. Different anatomy:\n-\nlocations,\n-\ntypes of inputs,\n-\ntypes of outputs.\nMany of the differences are as you would expect from\nthe midbrain locations: SOMATIC and LIMBIC\n\nThe ascending reticular activating system:\nArousal type 1\n- Electrical stimulation -\n- EEG arousal.\n- Effects show habituation.\n- Forced turning often occurs.\n- Rewarding/punishing effects are slight (not very\nrewarding or punishing in studies of electrical \"self\nstimulation\").\n- Ascending connections:\n- especially from vestibular, somatosensory, auditory and\nvisual systems; inputs also from cerebellum.\n- Descending connections:\n- especially from neocortex, corpus striatum, \"old\nthalamus\" and subthalamus.\n\nLimbic midbrain areas:\nArousal type 2\n- Anatomical locations: Central gray area (CGA);\nventral tegmental area (VTA)\n- Electrical stimulation -\n- EEG arousal\n- Resistant to habituation\n- Strong self-stimulation effects at low thresholds\n- Negative dorsally in CGA (Central Gray Area)\n- Positive ventrolaterally in VTA (Ventral Tegmental Area)\n- Connections from more caudal structures:\n- Visceral sensory\n- Connections from rostral structures of limbic forebrain\n- Hypothalamus; septal area and basal forebrain,\nhippocampal formation, amygdala.\n\nFig 11-4\nFocus here next\nCourte\n\nsy o f MIT Press.

Contrast neural-crest and placodal\norigins of secondary sensory neurons.\nA placode is a thickening of the embryonic ectoderm; neurogenic\nportions give rise to primary sensory neurons.\nThe trigeminal placode (a dorsolateral placode in the embryo),\nmade up of ophthalmic and maxillo-mandibular portions, is the\norigin of the cells of the trigeminal ganglion.\nThe otic placode (also a dorsolateral placode) is the origin of\norgans of hearing and of the vestibular system.\nThe olfactory placode is the origin of the olfactory epithelium.\nNote: In the hindbrain area, the epibranchial (epipharyngeal)\nplacodes are the origin of some of the ganglion cells of cranial nerves\nVII, IX and X.\n\nThe inadequacy of the traditional enumeration\nof 12 cranial nerves (a note from Butler & Hodos)\n- More than 12 are seen in embryonic development in humans.\n- 25 cranial nerves are listed by Butler & Hodos. But some are\nfound only in certain groups of vertebrates. e.g., the lateral line nerves\n- The facial (#7), glossopharyngeal (#9) and vagus (#10) each\ncontain two distinct parts.\n- However, it has become traditional to list just 12 cranial\nnerves.

ISBN: 9780262026734.\n\nThus, very early in chordate evolution, the bilateral\nprojection from the lateral eyes to the hypothalamus\nexpanded to become a crossed projection which\nreached structures eliciting escape movements.\n1. This probably happened even before image-forming eyes\nevolved. Even with simple light detectors, an animal could\ndiscriminate right from left.\n2. Image-forming eyes added to the ability of an animal to\nescape from a particular danger. The retinal projection to the\nmidbrain became topographically organized.\n3. Once a greater ability to distinguish different locations\nevolved, vision became useful also for orienting towards\nthings for exploration and approach.\n\nFurther evolution resulted in crossed representation of the space\naround the head at both midbrain and forebrain levels:\n- The usefulness of orienting towards visually detected objects led to\nthe evolution of a second descending pathway, separate from the\nuncrossed pathway. Rapid orienting towards a stimulus required\ncontraction of muscles on the same side of the neck.\n- The second descending pathway therefore crossed the midline of the\nmidbrain: the \"tectospinal\" tract descends to hindbrain and cervical spinal\ncord.\n- The somatosensory inputs to the midbrain tectum evolved into a\npredominantly crossed pathway in order to match the visual\nprojection. They responded to the same areas of space around the\nhead and were useful for triggering the same responses.\n- Thus, the right side of the space around the head came to be\nrepresented on the left side of the midbrain, and subsequently the\nforebrain as well. The other side developed in mirror-image\nfashion.\n\nSketch of two descending pathways\nfrom the midbrain tectum\n(from class 4)\n\nEvolution of Brain 4\nExpansion of midbrain with\nevolution of distance-receptor\nsenses: visual and auditory,\nreceptors with advantages over\nolfaction for speed and sensory\nacuity, for early warning and for\nanticipation of events.\n...................................\nMotor side: 1) escape loco\nmotion; 2) turning of head and\neyes with modulation by\nmotivational states, including\nthose triggered by olfactory\nsense.\nEndbrain\n'tweenbrain\nMidbrain\nAnti-predator\nbehavior:\nturning away,\nfleeing\nOrienting:\nturning of head\n& eyes toward\nCourtesy of MIT Press.

E. Schneider 2014\nPart 5: Differentiation of the brain vesicles\nMIT 9.14 Class 11\nWhy a midbrain?\nNotes on evolution, structure and functions\n\nAbove the hindbrain\n- We can get ideas about evolution of the\nmidbrain and forebrain from animals\nresembling the most primitive chordates.\n- We get additional ideas from comparative\nstudies of vertebrates.\n\nWhy a midbrain, and a forebrain rostral to it?\nProbable explanations\n- The midbrain, together with early components of the\nforebrain, was a kind of rostral extension of the hindbrain that\nenabled visual and olfactory control over motor patterns\n(like locomotion and orienting movements), and that added\nmore control by motivational states.\n- The midbrain received visual and olfactory inputs from\n'tweenbrain and endbrain, as well as sensory and other inputs\nfrom more caudal structures, including cerebellum.\n\nQuestions, chapter 11\n1) What are the two inputs carrying information\nabout light levels into the CNS?\nNext: Some notes about primitive vision and\nprimitive olfaction in chordates\n\nPrimitive vision\n1) Early role of optic input to the 'tweenbrain: Control of daily\ncycles of activity, with entrainment of the endogenous clock by\nthe day-night cycle\n- Neural mechanisms:\n- Pineal eye\n- Retinal input to hypothalamus (Note that the retina develops as an\noutpouching of the neural tube in the hypothalamic region.)\n- Diencephalic controls of sleep-waking physiology and behavior:\nepithalamus and anterior hypothalamus\n- Various cyclic motivational states/behaviors are influenced by\nthe biological clock and regulated by the 'tweenbrain:\nforaging and feeding, drinking, nesting, etc.\n2) In order for visual inputs to control locomotor responses\nmore directly, connections to the midbrain were involved.\n\nPrimitive olfaction\n- Olfaction was also, and remains, an important\ncontroller of behavioral state\n- Olfactory detection of object identity (learning,\nremembering, altering behavior)\n- Detecting sexual and individual identity\n- Discriminating \"good to consume\", \"bad to consume\": in\nconjunction with taste inputs to forebrain\n- Led to evolution of ventral striatum & amygdala, with\noutputs to hypothalamus\n- Olfactory detection of \"good place\", \"bad place\"\n(learning, remembering, directing behavior)\n- Led to evolution of medial pallium (hippocampus area) with\noutputs to ventral striatum & hypothalamus\nFor objects and places to influence actions, descending\npathways connected with midbrain structures.\n\nPrimitive olfaction\n- Approach-avoidance of objects or animals, or of\nplaces, required links from endbrain and\n'tweenbrain to more caudal structures.

What connections?\n\nStructural studies give evidence that non-cortical\nstructures in amphibians, reptiles and birds are related\nto neocortex of mammals\n- Each sensory system connects to thalamic cell groups that are\nprimarily unimodal, and these cell groups project mainly to the\nneocortex of mammals\n- In birds, also in reptiles and amphibians, thalamus contains\nunimodal cell groups that project to structures that appear to be\nstriatum (studies by Karten and others using, originally, Nauta\nmethods for silver-staining of degenerating axons).\n- A novel proposal was put forth by Harvey Karten when he was\nwith Nauta at MIT: He proposed that embryonic cells migrate\nfrom a striatal location to neocortex. Thus, many neocortical\ncells in mammals are directly homologous to striatal cells in\nbirds (more specifically, cells of what was called the\nneostriatum, now called the nidopallium).\n- This has recently been tested, with surprising results.\n\nIllustrations of H. Karten's proposal that the DVR of\nSauropsids and the lateral portions of the neocortex of\nmammals originated from the same region of proliferating\nembryonic cells that migrated differently as the two groups\nseparated in evolution..\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.

The layers are the more\nsuperficial layers 2-4. Those layers contain many inhibitory\ninterneurons that do not arise from the ventricular layer of the\ndeveloping cortex. Where do they come from?\n10) The lateral ventricular angle region of the mammalian\nembryonic brain is at least partly homologous to the dorsal\nventricular ridge of sauropsids. There is some evidence from\nGolgi studies that some neuroblasts from this region migrate\ninto neocortex, but such studies, and also gene expression\nstructures as well.

What does it predict about the projections (outputs) of the\noptic tectum in birds, with a very large tectum, and in nocturnal mammals, with a\nmuch smaller tectum?\n11) Neuroanatomical experiments indicate that the primary motor cortex of rhesus\nmonkeys contains a rostral older part and a more caudal newer part. How are these\ntwo parts different? See figure 15.8\n12) What is the \"highest\" level of motor control? This question can be answered in\nvarious ways. Try to answer it after defining what you assume to be highest.\n(There is no single way to answer this question.)\n\nA question about the motor system's\nhigher levels\n- Previously discussed: At highest level, we have\nneocortical sensory areas with projections to the\nstriatum, resulting in outputs for learned habits.\n- We also have motor cortex with direct projections to\nspinal cord, supporting fine control of extremities (as\nalready discussed).\n- Question: Why has motor cortex become so\ndominant? in primates\n\nWhy has motor cortex become so dominant?\n- It is not only because of its striatal connections or\nbecause of direct projections to motor neurons in cord.\n- It is because of its close connections with a system for\nanticipation of, and planning for, the future:\n- The immediate future, e.g., frontal eye fields moving eyes to\npositions of expected stimuli\n- More distant future too: for achieving goals of motivational\nstates\n- This is role of the prefrontal* cortex.\n- Much of the prefrontal* cortex - the lateral prefrontal region - is\nclosely connected to anterior cingulate cortex, and thence to the\nhippocampal formation.\n- This lateral prefrontal cortex is not fully developed in humans until\nthey are in their early 20s.\n[* Prefrontal = the frontal association cortex]\n\nA sketch of the central nervous system and its\norigins\nG.

How is it different from a reflex\n(even though it may be called a reflex by\nneurologists)?\n3) Similarly, name a movement pattern that is largely\nunder the control of the spinal cord, and completely\nso in many species.\n\n\"Reflex deglutition\" (swallowing)\n- Involves about 20 muscles controlled by neurons from\nmidbrain to cervical spinal cord levels.\n- In this case, experiments have shown that the pattern of\ncontractions is centrally programmed:\n- Pattern is not changed by experimental elimination of\nproprioceptive feedback during any stage of the movement\nonce it is triggered.\n- It is a \"fixed action pattern\" (FAP), inborn, and is executed\nrhythmically with a steady or varied stimulus via the superior\nlaryngeal nerve.\n- It is normally triggered by stimulation of the tongue deep in\nthe throat.\n- There is also an endogenous input that builds up over time\nand lowers the threshold for eliciting the response.\n[Study by Doty & Bosma, 1956]\n\nQuestions, chapter 16\n2) What was the basic argument in Karl Lashley's\npaper in 1917 called \"The problem of serial order in\nbehavior\"?\n\nKarl Lashley's 1917 paper:\n\"The problem of serial order in behavior\"\n(Lashley is often considered to be the major pioneer of the field of \"physiological\npsychology\" or biopsychology, now called \"behavioral neuroscience.\")\n- Lashley argued against the adequacy of the reflex\nchaining hypothesis. Example:\n- \"The finger strokes of a musician may reach 16/sec in\npassages which call for a definite and changing order of\nsuccessive finger movements.\"\n- \"The succession of movements is too quick even for visual\nreaction time.\"\n- Conclusion: There must be central generation of\npatterns of movement.\n\nSimilarly, many fixed action patterns--inherited\nmovement abilities--are centrally generated.\n- We have already mentioned one such pattern: swallowing.\n- Others:\n- Grooming by mice (Fentriss' experiments): Movement\npatterns continue even without the usual feedback\nstimulation.\n- Egg rolling in gulls (Tinbergen): Movements can occur even\nafter the stimulus has been removed.\n- Other examples of \"in vacuo\" movement patterns\n- Locomotor movements in fish: Central generation of\nrhythmic fin movements\n- Locomotor movements in mammals are similarly generated\nin the spinal cord, but they require activation from the\nperiphery or from descending fiber systems (from the brain).\nHow are these action patterns generated, if not by reflex circuitry?\n\nQuestions, chapter 16\n5) How is central generation of a temporal pattern\npossible? What two types of mechanism other than\nS-R circuits are described in the chapter?\n\nTemporal patterns in movements:\ntypes of explanations\n- Straight-through processing concepts (S-R models)\n- Feedback circuitry\n- Endogenous CNS activity\n- Combinations of these mechanisms\n\nFeedback circuitry:\nthe \"reverberating circuits\" idea\n- Self re-exciting loops\n- regular bursts of action potentials (a kind of\ncentral oscillator)\n- Negative feedback in homeostatic mechanisms:\n- The response oscillates around a certain level of\nsome input (the set point).\n\nFeedback circuit at its simplest level:\npatterned output from unpatterned input\nWhat assumptions are necessary for this simple circuit to work this way?\nCourtesy of MIT Press.

Contrast the connections.\n\nb) Fear in response to detection of specific auditory stimuli, even if very low in amplitude, can\nbe learned. Such learning in rodents appears to depend on a pathway from the medial\ngeniculate body of the thalamus direct to a subcortical structure. What structure? (This\npathway may be considerably larger in mammals with a relatively smaller neocortex.)\n\n3) What transformation of the middle ear apparatus occurred in very early mammals that gave\nthem an advantage in avoiding reptilian predators?

What structures are involved? What are the\nmajor types of connections to these structures? What are the effects of electrical stimulation? Is\nthere habituation to repeated stimulation?\n\n3) Describe how hypothalamic neurons control secretions from each of the two divisions of the\npituitary organ (the hypophysis).\n\n4) What hormones are secreted into the bloodstream in the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis)?\nGive examples of hormones secreted in the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis).\n\n5) What is diabetes insipidus?\n\n6) What homeostatic mechanisms are associated with the hypothalamus? (Give examples.)\n\n7) Give specific examples of appetitive and of consummatory behavior. Which parts of the CNS\nwould you expect to be strongly involved in the control of these two types of behavior?\n\n8) Where would you expect hunger and satiety cues to influence the CNS? Why?\n\n9) What evidence indicates that attack motivation in cats in separate from hunger?\n\nQuestions based on Schneider chapter 26 and classes\n\n1) The hypothalamus has two major divisions, medial and lateral. What is a major difference\nbetween these two divisions?\n\n2) Information about the internal environment of the body reaches the hypothalamus via two major\nmeans. What are they?\n\n3) Describe the basic Papez' circuit. Why has there been a revival of interest in this circuit?\n\n4) How are the Papez' circuit structures connected to non-limbic neocortical areas?\n\n5) What is the \"basal forebrain\"? Name some structures of this region.\n\n6) Describe two ways that the hypothalamus can influence the neocortex.\n\n9.14, MIT, Spring 2014\nClasses #27-29\n\n7) What is a major \"reward pathway\" in the mammalian CNS?\n\n8) Contrast the effects of sudden disconnection of the hypothalamus from more caudal structures,\nand more gradual disconnection accomplished in many small steps.\n\nAdditional questions on readings: Brodal, also Schneider chapter.\n\n1) Which major hypothalamic division can be divided into multiple distinct nuclei (e.g., by Le\nGros Clark in 1936)? How can the remainder of the hypothalamus be characterized?\n\n2) How can a circulating hormone like angiotensin II control hypothalamic neurons even though it\ndoes not pass through the blood-brain barrier?\n\n3) What is the importance of afferents to the hypothalamus from the nucleus of the solitary tract in\nthe hindbrain?\n\n4) The cingulate cortex (a paralimbic cortical area above the corpus callosum) projects to the\nhippocampal formation. Describe the pathway from there to the hypothalamus. How does a\npathway go from there back to the cingulate gyrus? (The loop is called \"Papez' circuit\".) (Note:\nBrodal on p. 400 summarizes a different pathway from cingulate cortex to hypothalamus via the\nseptal nuclei. This is not usually mentioned as part of the Papez' circuit, although it is certainly\nrelated.)\n\n5) A person's mental state can influence the endocrine organs via the hypothalamus. The influence\ncan go in the reverse direction: the hypothalamus can influence a person's mental state in major\nways. What are some effects of disturbance of the hypothalamus during neurosurgical\nprocedures?\n\nAdditional questions on readings: Nauta & Feirtag\n\n6) In Nauta's view, what is the relative importance of direct hypothalamus to spinal cord pathways\nvs. polysynaptic pathways?\n\n7) What is misleading about the names \"autonomic nervous system\" and \"voluntary (somatic)\nnervous system\"?\n\n8) (Review) Contrast the styles of motor innervation of somatic muscles and smooth muscles\n(including the contrast between sympathetic and parasympathetic).\n\n9) (Review) How does the innervation of the sweat glands in the skin differ from sympathetic\ninnervation of other organs?\n\n10) How does Nauta define homeostasis?\n\n9.14, MIT, Spring 2014\nClasses #27-29\n\n11) Describe Rudolf Thauer's experiments on disconnection of the hypothalamus in rabbits.

[Review of chapter 14.]\n\n13) Summarize in general terms the major functions of the \"behavioral control column\" that extends\nfrom rostral hypothalamus to caudal midbrain. (Swanson ch 6)\n\n14) What were the three widely projecting monoamine-containing systems first characterized by\nDahlstrom and Fuxe in the 1960s, and the locations of the cell bodies? (This is a review of\nconnections reviewed previously with regard to \"brain states.\") Several more diffusely\nprojecting systems have been discovered since that time. Describe one of them with cells\nlocated in the hypothalamus. (Swanson ch 7; also Schneider chapter 17)\n\n15) What is the difference in operation of the parvicellular and magnocellular portions of the\nautonomic motor system of the hypothalamus? Give examples of functions of each of these\nportions.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.14 Brain Structure and Its Origins\nSpring 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

This method is used in many figures in\nthe books for this class, especially in Georg Striedter's book.\n\n5) What are the four major groups of vertebrate animals in which there has been an\nevolution of marked expansions in brain size. (There is much variation in each of these\ngroups.)\n\n6) Serotonin is an important neuromodulator substance released at the axonal endings of\ncertain neurons. Which animals have such serotonergic neurons? What is the type of\nfunction of these neurons emphasized by Allman?\n\n7) Using only a few words for each, contrast the methods used to study brain localization\nby Franz Josef Gall and Johann Spurzheim, Pierre Flourens, Paul Broca, John Hughlings\nJackson, and Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig, and Clinton Woolsey.\n\n8) How did Tatsuji Inouye, an ophthalmologist in Japan, first discover the topographic\norganization of the primary visual cortex in humans? (Similar methods were used for\nboth somatosensory and visual systems of humans by Hans-Lukas Teuber--the founder\nof the department at MIT that became BCS--and his collaborators in the USA.) How\nhas his map been confirmed and extended for humans recently?\n\n9) According to Striedter (and many others, including Butler and Hodos), what is the\nproblem with using some kind of \"scale of nature\" (Latin scala naturae) to rank\ndifferent species and use such a ranking to understand evolution?\n\n10) What is a cladogram? Cf. Darwin's sketch reproduced on p. 29 of Striedter's book.

      "content": "9.14, MIT, Spring 2014\nClasses #30\n\n9.14\nClass #30: Hormonal and other influences on brain development and\nplasticity\n\nQuestions based on Schneider chapter 27 and classes:\n\n1) What are three factors that are likely to play roles in the development of sex differences in the\ncentral nervous system of mammals including humans?\n\n2) Neuroanatomical studies of sex differences in the human brain were initially focused on what\nregion? More recent studies have used methods for imaging the brain of living persons. Give an\nexample of findings using this method.\n\n3) Name and describe the location of a cell group in the spinal cord where sexual dimorphism is\nvery marked.\n\n4) What appears to be a major cause of variation in sexual orientation in humans?\n\n5) What were the striking findings made in Fernando Nottebohm's lab at Rockefeller University in\ntheir studies of canary brains? There were two major findings (actually pairs of findings).\n\n6) What in addition to hormonal factors may explain male-female differences in brain structure and\nfunction?\n\nQuestions on additional readings: Swaab and Hofman\n\n1. Briefly compare evidence for genetic factors, hormonal influences and social environment in the\ndetermination of sexual orientation.\n\n2. What are three or four very clear examples of neurological or psychiatric disease where there are\ndramatic sex differences?\n\n3. When are sex differences in gonadal hormone levels at the highest levels in human development,\nand when do morphological differences in the hypothalamus appear?\n\n4. Describe one of the technical factors in studying morphological differences in the hypothalamus\nof postmortem human brains. What is the Swaab and Hofman solution?\n\n5. What are two cell groups of the human hypothalamus which differ between the sexes? How are\nthey different in hetero- and homosexuals?\n\nQuestions on readings: Nottebohm and abstracts\n\n9.14, MIT, Spring 2014\nClasses #30\n\n1. Describe the evidence from Nottebohm et al. that the male canary brain changes from season to\nseason. What did he think the change was caused by? How has the work of Sarah Bottjer\nmodified this view?\n\n2. Although only male canaries sing, both male and female canary brains are constantly acquiring\nnew neurons. Why might the females need new neurons (and loss of old ones)?\n\n3. Describe the findings of Toran-Allerand which indicate that sex differences in the brain are\nprobably much more widespread than has been indicated in the studies of cell-stained human\npost-mortem material.\n\nQuestions on readings: Baum\n\n4. What structures in the CNS besides the hypothalamus have sexual dimorphism?\n\n5. Why were some of these findings so controversial after the first reports?\n\n6. Why do some human beings develop a female body and brain despite being genetically male\nand having testes rather than ovaries?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.14 Brain Structure and Its Origins\nSpring 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
