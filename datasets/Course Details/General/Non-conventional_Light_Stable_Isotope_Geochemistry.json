Understanding the concentrations of organics in the\natmosphere constrains the reaction pathways and exit channels that are involved in sulfur MIF.\n1. Haze Free\nSOURCE: S02 photolysis is the major source of sulfur M IF\nEXIT CHANNElS; For the haze-free state, increasing CH4 allows elemental sulfur to polymerize,\npromot ing 58 as the reducing exit channel. At the same time, 502 becomes t he dominant\noxidized exit channel.\n2. Thin Organic Haze\nCH4 : CO2 -0.2\nSOURCE: Opacity of haze lowered the rates of S02 photolysis in the lower atmosphere, but S02\nphotolysis still was a likely source of sulfur MIF. In addition, symmetry dependent de-excitation\nof 502could have also been an important S-MIF source.\nEXIT CHANNElS: S02 and other minor channels.\nSwitching between th ese two states could explain the slope changes in the 6 365/ 6335.\nWeakness\nThey are not able to explain why rotat ion of the data array on t he 633 5 v. 6 36 5 plot is happening. They\nsay t hat\" a rotation of the arrays to different slopes instead implies a change in the nature of the\nprimary S-MIF signature, either due to a change in 6 36S/tJ.335 for a single atmospheric signal, or due to\nvariable amounts of mixing between atmospheric sources wit h differe nt 6 365/ 6335\" (pg. 2).

      "content": "Summary of Estrade et al. 2009 (Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta)\nEstrade et al (2009) perform both equilibrium and dynamic (kinetic) evaporation\nexperiments to measure the isotope fractionation between liquid and gasÂ·phase mercury.\nEquilibrium experiments gave them 202aeQliQuid.vapor values of 1.00086, with the vapor depleted in\n6202Hg by 0.86%0, across the range of temperatures tested. ReyleighÂ·type dynamic\nfractionation experiments produced a fractionation factor at 22Â°C of 20 2aOyrl liQ Uid _v~por = 1.0067,\nwhich agrees (within uncertainty) to their re-analysis of historical data e02a=1.0076).\nEquilibrium evaporation experiments display mass-independent fractionation in 199Hg and\n201Hg, with 6199Hg = 0.12%0 and 6201Hg = 0.07%0, whereas 200Hg was mass-dependent to within\nthe uncertainty of t he measurement. Smaller 6 199Hg and 6201Hg anomalies were observed in\nthe dynamic experiments, depending upon the conditions. This data produces a 6 199Hg / 6201Hg\nslope of 2.0 Â± 0.6, which is (within uncertainty) similar to the predicted nuclear volume isotope\neffect (slope of 2.47), but significantly different from the slopes of 1.00 and 1.36 observed by\nBergquiest and Blum (2007) and attributed to magnetic isotope effect. The authors therefore\nhypothesize that the anomalous isotope fractionation is due to nuclear volume isotope effect.\nThis study is novel and significant because it demonstrates significant mass-independent\nfractionation in the odd isotopes of mercury occurring in a simple physical process (i.e.\nevaporation). Although the effect is small, it could potentially be attributed to a nuclear\nvolume isotope effect. Nuclear volume isotope effects are pred icted to be observed mostly in\nreactions where there are changes in redox state causing a change in the electron configuration\nof the heavy atom. However, in this case a nuclear volume effect is observed where both the\nproduct (HgO vapor) and the reactant (Hgo liquid) are in the same redox stat e. Since\nevaporation of mercury vapor does not involve radicals, it is unlikely that the observed effect\ncould be kinetic in nature. This study is significant in showing that it is possible to observe\nnuclear volume isotope effects in physical processes with no change in redox state. However,\nthe isotope effects observed in these experiments are unlikely to be relevant in earth surface\nenvironments, since the mercury MIF caused by photoreduction of mercury and methylmercury\nproduce a much stronger signal that more closely matches that observed in natural samples.\nThis study had several strengths. The authors did a good job reviewing the theory and\nusing the theory to explain their experimental resu lts. They also went back and re-analyzed\nhistorical literature data from the 1920's, converting it from density data to the modern delta\nnotation and showing that it is consistent with their experiments. In addition, the equilibrium\nexperiments were well designed, although I do not believe they justified strongly enough that\nthey had actually reached equ ilibrium. I thought the dynamic experim ents might be measuring\nadditional isotope fractionations beyond that from evaporation, such as an effect of\ncondensation on the walls, diffusion through the system, or possibly an effect from the large\ntemperature gradient in the system.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n12.491 Non-conventional Light Stable Isotope Geochemistry\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
