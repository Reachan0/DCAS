  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week; 2 hours / session\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course studies the relations of affect to cognition and behavior, feeling to thinking and acting, and values to beliefs and practices. These connections will be considered at the psychological level of organization and in terms of their neurobiological and sociocultural counterparts. In addition to weekly class sessions, students participate in small study groups that meet for two hours per week.\n\nTopics\n\nThe syllabus contains, in a single document, a detailed description of the approach to 9.68 including information about the reading and writing assignments, the collaborative learning system, study groups and grading.\n(PDF)\n\nIntroduction and Overview\n\nConduct and Administration of Subject\n\nStudents: Caveat Emptor\n\nFinal grades\n\nInstructional subsystem\n\nCommunication\n\nBeing there: Attendance and participation\n\nConsider your attitudes\n\nStudy groups\n\nFirst group meeting\n\nDevelopmental trajectories\n\nFormative evaluation\n\nWorkload\n\nThe MFA field trip\n\nAssignments\n\nRequired text\n\nAdditional Readings\n\nViewing films\n\nJournal-keeping\n\nKeeping a timesheet\n\nWriting reaction papers\n\nPlagiarism\n\nPaper chase format\n\nWhat is collaborative learning?\n\nPlanning/producing end-of-term project or paper\n\nInterim and final grades\n\nA final note about the 9.68 learning process\n\nIntroduction and Overview\n\n\"Everything that is said, is said by someone.\" (H. Maturana)\n\nWe Exchange Some Preliminary Information\n\n\"So (here we are - in the middle way - having spent many years) Trying to learn to use words, and every attempt\n\nIs a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure\n\nBecause one has only learnt to get the better of words\n\nFor the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which\n\nOne is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture\n\nIs a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate\n\nWith shabby equipment always deteriorating\n\nIn the general mess of imprecision of feeling,\n\nUndisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer\n\nBy strength and submission, has already been discovered\n\nOnce or twice, or several times, by those whom one cannot hope\n\nTo emulate - but there is no competition -\n\nThere is only the fight to recover what has been lost\n\nAnd found and lost again and again; and now, under conditions\n\nThat seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.\n\nFor us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.\n\nHome is where one starts from.\" (T.S. Eliot, \"Four Quartets\")\n\n\"Home\": Broadly speaking (in this case) denotes the \"place\" (in space/time) to which we have come in the course of living our lives; that is, the \"perspective\" and \"point of view\" to which we have come regarding our relation to the world based in and on our own experiences. In our participatory universe, all observers must acknowledge their (our) implication with what can be known.\n\nNeedless to add: attentiveness to scope and limitations of these mental (cognitive, affective) and behavioral (postural/expressive/verbal/gestural etc.) particulars of our personal and social (academic/professional) backgrounds and experiences is part of the whole approach to the learning process. Abstract as they may seem to be, \"perspectives\" and \"points of view\" both personally held and socially imposed are altogether real in the sense of conditioning and constraining the sensitivity, scope and penetrativeness of our perceptions of the world and its contents, including ourselves and each other.\n\n(Note how intimately and recurrently, perspectives (our ways of approaching situations) condition/constrain our perceptions and conceptions (i.e. notions of what we \"see\").\n\nNote also the widespread use among us of \"seeing\" as a metaphor for knowing. What do you make of the fact that so many of the verbal tokens of meaning that we have for expressing our sense of \"knowing\" are rooted in concrete and particular references to the visual sense and \"seeing.\"\n\nFurther to the point: the particular attitudes (cognitively and affectively defined thoughts and feelings, mental sets) that each of us brings with us into this room on this first evening of another \"new\" semester are bound to influence our perceptions (e.g. of what is actually going on here). And, of course, our perceptions of ourselves in this situation condition and constrain our behavior in response to stimulation arising from the situation--and so on and so forth, in recurrent cycles of mutual and reciprocal causality.\n\nIn the late 1890's, in a notable passage in his justly famous\n\"Talks to Teachers\"\nmy favorite psychologist, William James, announces the advent of some new and powerful, down-to-earth, methods of student-centered, hands-on, problem posing, concrete object learning/teaching.\n\n\"Verbal reactions, useful as they are, are insufficient. The words may be right, but the conceptions corresponding to them are often direfully wrong. In a modern school, therefore, they quite properly form only a small part of what the pupil is required to do. He must keep notebooks, make drawings, plans, and maps, take measurements, enter the laboratory and perform experiments, consult authorities, keep journals and write essays. He must do in his fashion what is often laughed at by outsiders when it appears in prospectuses under the title of 'original work,' but what is really the only possible training for the doing of original work thereafter. The most colossal improvement which recent years have seen in secondary education lies in the introduction of manual training; not because it gives us a people more handy and practical for domestic life and better skilled in trades, but also and even more so because it gives us citizens with an entirely different intellectual fibre.\n\n\"Laboratory work and shop work engender a habit of observation, a knowledge of the difference between accuracy and vagueness, and an insight into nature's complexity and into the inadequacy of all abstract verbal accounts of real phenomena, which once wrought into the mind, remain there as lifelong possessions. They confer precision; because, if you are\ndoing\na thing, you must do it definitely right or definitely wrong. They give honesty; for, when you express yourself by making things, and not by using words, it becomes impossible to dissimulate your vagueness or ignorance by ambiguity. They beget a habit of self-reliance; they keep the interest and attention always cheerfully engaged, and reduce the teacher's disciplinary functions to a minimum.\"\n\nConduct and Administration of Subject\n\nStudents: Caveat Emptor\n\nThe length and detail of this syllabus is unusual, and requires, at this point, something in the way of an explanation/justification. This is not an ordinary undergraduate subject of instruction like most of the lecture-based classes that you have been in here at MIT.\n\nThink of it as something akin to an open-ended and\nacademically serious exercise in scholarly (scientific) inquiry\ninto the subject before us. We aim to keep to a minimum the time spent \"lecturing\" while at the same time encouraging everyone in the class to pursue honest hands-on, proactive involvement. This syllabus is intended to provide you with a rather detailed narrative account of the subject before us. For all of its shortcomings and prolixities, the syllabus should suffice both to guide the 9.68 learning system through the topics and to serve as a source of information of the kind that lectures might otherwise focus on. So please read it fully, attentively, actively and frequently.\n\nFair Warning: Ultimately, the quality of your learning experience in this class will be decisively determined by--and play a role in determining--the quality of everyone else's. Anyone sincerely aspiring to come away from this class with a quality final grade and a credible, trustworthy and useful understanding of nature and scope of the subject before us must first of all be ready, willing and able to put the stipulated modicum of weekly time and effort into the 9.68 learning process for the next 14 weeks.\n\nFinal Grades\n\nWill vary and be commensurable with our evaluation of the quality, timeliness, and consistency of your effort and involvement. Everyone enrolled in this class can and will receive a first-quality final grade (i.e. an A) provided only that each and all of you are ready, willing and able to devote a modicum of 12 hours per week of quality time/effort (participation/observation) to the collaborative learning process that lies at the heart of our approach.\n\nRegular and faithful attendance, punctuality, attentiveness, honesty, sincerity, as well as frequent, timely, and concise formative evaluation (preferably constructive and succinct) are also keys to success. Tapping into the relevant information and framing feedback in an effective way, is not a completely straightforward process. The scope and acuity of our perspectives--like the incisiveness and comprehensiveness of our descriptions of our lived experiences--are ultimately limited by the partiality of our own particular personal and social perspectives (and these, in turn reflect the diversity of our lived experiences).\n\nWhat knowledge and skills are you hoping and expecting to be able to take away from this class?\n\nWhat amount and quality of time/effort are you ready, willing and able to put into it? What final grade are you hoping and expecting to end up with?\n\nThink in terms of the full range of available final grades and reflect on the quality of your performance accordingly.\n\nInstructional Subsystem\n\nSteve Chorover\n\nCommunication\n\nThe difficulties of language are many and varied. Our experience teaches us that it is extremely important for us to be as clear and concise and as open as possible in communicating with each other and with you, our students, regarding what we see as key substantive and procedural issues before us. In your communications with us, and each other, we encourage you to do the same.\n\nThis means making serious and sustained efforts to provide classmates, groupmates, and the learning process as a whole with pertinent and timely input and feedback. As already noted, this aims to be a credible and serious instance of human inquiry. In order to be trustworthy, and useful, such an enterprise must embody and reflect values such as honesty, respectfulness, attentiveness, constructive criticism, conciseness, coherence and clarity of communication.\n\nIn addressing 9.68-related emails to each other, whether within or between study groups, please feel free to cc. group and classmates, and us as appropriate.\n\nYou are encouraged to be yourself while becoming also a serious student of the subject before us. Issues will arise about which you will feel strongly; feel free to voice your opinions regarding substantive or procedural issues directly, to each other and to us either publicly (if appropriate), in study group, in class, or privately during office hours--by chance or appointment. Please do not be surprised if we suggest that the issues you are raising really deserve to be considered by the entire class.\n\nBeing there: Attendance and Participation\n\nAs already noted, collaborative learning is not a spectator sport. Full, timely and complete attendance and conscientious participation by everyone in all regularly scheduled 9.68 activities is expected.\n\nConsider your Attitudes\n\nBeginnings are important. How are you feeling at the point of entry? Here is some good advice to would-be learners, from Alexander Bain and John Stuart Mill:\n\n\"Take care to launch yourself with as strong and decided an initiative as possible.\"\n\n\"Seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every constructive resolution you make, follow every emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits you aspire to gain.\"\n\n\"Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day.\"\n\n\"Pedagogical soundness lies in teachers learning to connect matters to be newly learned with the sort of material with which the pupils' minds are likely to be already spontaneously engaged.\"\n\nPlease examine-re-evaluate and adjust as need be&ndsah;your customary \"default assumptions\" about what is going to be happening here.\n\nIn order for you to be able to work together with each other and with us within stipulated time/effort limits [toward the attainment of the hopefully common and explicitly stated subject-related objectives] you need to agree, among yourselves, how you are going to view these guidelines.\n\nStudy Groups\n\nIn 9.68, we don't ordinarily focus on details of the group formation process as closely as we do in 9.70. Nevertheless, we view the formation of the 9.68 collaborative learning system as a prototypical instance of a process that can be found (mutatis mutandis) in the organization and development of myriad other human social systems. (If the meaning of this paragraph is not clear to you, please inquire further. See also Developmental trajectories below).\n\nFirst Group Meeting\n\nAs already noted, beginnings are important. You should take some time at the outset to consider the suitability of the \"social architecture\" of the environment in which you are intending to meet. Get comfortable in your meeting place and start becoming acquainted with each other.\n\nIf, as seems likely, this line of inquiry initially leads you to recite the usual facts in the locally time-honored way: (e.g. with cliches relating to past or present MIT courses of study, MIT living groups, MIT classes, etc.) that's ok. But please try not to stop there. Once you've gotten that altogether commonplace part of your introductions out of the way, what else do you have to say to each other? What is special or unusual about you? Who are you? Where are you coming from? Where are you heading? Why are you taking this class? What do you make of it thus far?\n\n\"9.68\" is what you all have in common here, and all of you have just completed the benchmark questionnaire and been through the first class session. The instructors claim to be trying to foster a hands-on, problem posing, pedagogical approach (aka \"collaborative learning\"). What do you think about that?\n\nThis would be a good time to talk together with your groupmates and classmates about what you are all getting yourselves in to and how you are hoping and expecting to deal with the demand characteristics of the situation. What are your expectations and default assumptions now--has anything changed in regard to your hopes and fears (if any)--concerning the likely developmental trajectory of the 9.68 collaborative learning system and your own involvement in it?\n\nOf course, no two human systems (no two people, families, groups, 9.68 classes, etc. etc.) are exactly the same, but in most cases they seem to become organized and develop in essentially the same way. Hence, we know and can say a few things with some confidence about the process.\n\nDistribute:\n\nStudy Group Roster Forms\n\nTimesheets\n\n\"Working Groups\"\n\nSome Issues To Consider At Your First Study Group Meeting:\n\nDid everyone make it on time and without incident?\n\nHas everyone completed the first assignment?\n\nEvaluate the suitability of your surroundings. Is the \"social architecture\" of the situation appropriate? Is the place and time conducive to conducting a \"study group\" meeting? If not, is there a better alternative available?\n\nTry to get comfortable; say \"hello!\" politely and \"how are you?\" This (by the luck of the draw) is your study group and will remain so for the rest of the term. Prepare to listen to each other. Be open to possibly having to revise/update assumptions in accordance with new information;\n\nHow do you want - hope and expect - the class/study group to develop?\n\nHow educationally valuable to you will it be?\n\nAs you introduce yourselves, think about the terms in which you and your peers \"normally\" define/identify yourselves in MIT undergraduate academic contexts such as this one?\n\nTry to identify some of the explicit (members of the same organization, roommates, etc.) and implicit loyalties (both \"visible\" and \"invisible\") in the study group and the class as a whole\n\nCompare/contrast your \"first impressions\" of this class.\n\nWe are all constantly, invariably, and inescapably engaged in endeavoring to manage the impressions that we make on other people. How are these commonplace efforts at \"impression management\" influencing your interactions with each other.\n\nWhat is your view of the other study groups?\n\nWhy is the class being defined as \"collaborative\" and being thus organized into \"study groups\"?\n\nAre these arrangements intended to be cooperative or competitive?\n\nAre there any \"serious\" students in this group? In the class? What do we mean by \"serious\" in this context?\n\nDevelopmental Trajectories\n\nGenerally speaking, the organization and development of all human social systems is comprehensible as following a timecourse with a characteristic trajectory from beginning to end and moving through a number of more or less separate and distinct phases or stages. We are participating in and observing the organization and development of a system life cycle. This is a process with a characteristic trajectory. Based on prior experience, we can safely expect the 9.68 learning process to traverse--in its own way--an ordered sequence of more or less fixed and invariant stages or phases that may be analogized to conception, gestation, birth, infancy, childhood, adolescence, maturity, old age, senescence and death.\n\nBy a hypothesis that you are invited to critically evaluate, there are discernible parallels in the developmental stages or phases of individual and group systems. Of course, each instance is different, but there remain commonalities and parallels (e.g. in the cognitive, affective and expressive demand characteristics of each and all). Moreover, the process is characteristically marked by the tendency of specific, context-appropriate \"crises\" to arise. (e.g. Approach/Avoidance Conflict, Basic Trust/Basic Mistrust, Power and Control, Autonomy/Interdependence; competition/collaboration; Generativity or Stagnation).\n\nFormative Evaluation\n\nHow are you doing in this class? (No, it is not too early to be asking this question.) Reflect on your attitude; on the quality and amount of your participation; do so frequently and recurrently throughout the term. The concept of\nformative evaluation\nis applicable to any goal-oriented activity (e.g. a design process). What is going well? What is not so good and needs improvement?\n\nWe expect you to participate fully in all stages and aspects of the observation/evaluation process. The Timesheet (see below) is intended to provide a first step in the process of monitoring the amount of time and the quality of the effort per week that you put into making the collaborative learning system work effectively.\n\nWorkload\n\nBased on your knowledge of the \"MIT system\" and applicable nomenclature, please:\n\n\"unpack\" the foregoing subject description\n\nreflect, insofar as you can at this point, on your own inwardly experienced thoughts and feelings about the present situation. For example: with which particular constellation of attitudes have you come? How might your present attitudes be related to your present and future behavior in this class? Might your attitudes be expected to influence (for example) the \"seriousness\" with which you are ready, willing and able to approach the subject before us?\n\nshare with others your understanding of the stipulated \"workload\". Try to make explicit your expectations (hopes, fears) regarding the average amount of time per week to be spent working on it and say something about the general quality of individual and collective effort that you expect yourself and others to be putting into it during the next few months.\n\nOver the years 9.68 has evolved into a 12 unit elective subject requiring of participants a nominal average of 8 hours of solo weekly time and effort completing stated reading, viewing, and writing assignments (e.g. \"reaction papers\" and other exercises). With a few exceptions we all will meet at this time and place weekly as a class, and everyone meets separately with a study group whose membership has been randomly determined for two hours weekly at a time and place tba and whose main task it is to serve its members and the class as a whole by making appropriate, and constructive contributions to the overall organization and development of 9.68_13. Our central aim is to help in shaping the class into a collaborative learning system of the highest possible educational quality and of the greatest possible personal and social value to those who comprise it.\n\nIn such a class, the learning experience is no mere spectator sport. Active participation by all in shaping the organization and development of the collaborative learning system is a basic focus of both the formation and evaluation of the collaborative learning process that serves as the core element of our\nmodus operandi.\n\nBecause of the vagaries of the MIT Academic Calendar, the actual schedule of our weekly class meetings is a bit irregular. The workload has been adjusted accordingly but is still not meant to be light weight. The catalog description sets out the terms of the contract implicit in the fact of our participation here. In order for the class to succeed in its objectives everyone involved needs to put in a good faith modicum of time and effort. To be more precise, the class as a whole will succeed if everyone puts into it, on the average, 12 hours per week of high quality time and effort. Let us reiterate the point for emphasis: experience teaches us that success in creating a workable collaborative learning system depends on the readiness, willingness and ability of everyone involved to make--and to expect everyone else to make--a genuine good-faith effort to devote the stipulated modicum of time and effort to the process.\n\nThe MFA Field Trip\n\nAccording to the official MIT calendar there will be no class meeting for the third class. Instead, this will consist of a Field Trip-In Search of Quality--to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA). Once again this year, the Field Trip to the MFA will be conducted as a whole-class outing.\n\nAssignments\n\nThe completion of weekly assignments in a systematic, timely and conscientious fashion means doing some things before others. Assignments are meant to be done in the order indicated in the syllabus. Your study group should discuss and agree on a schedule that enables timely completion of required tasks before group discussions.\n\nRequired Text\n\nWe will begin as 9.68 classes have been doing for more than two decades: with several weeks of reading (perhaps many of us re-reading) and discussing Robert M. Pirsig's\nZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n(William Morrow and Co., 1974). Notably,\nZAAMM\nis a book whose subtitle identifies it as \"\nAn Inquiry into Values\".\nHow do \"values\" relate to \"affect\"?\n\nYou should acquire your own personal copy of this text to have and to hold (and to mark up as need be). There is a cheaper, more compact Bantam or Pocket Book edition, but you are advised to get the larger format paperback edition that the Tech Coop appears to have in sufficient numbers.\n\nAdditional Readings\n\nOther readings will be available on the course web site.\n\nPlease print out copies to read, to mark-up as appropriate, to keep and to bring with you to study group and class discussions.\n\nViewing Films\n\nSome of the videos that you are required to watch (and will subsequently discuss in study groups and class) will be accessible from the course website. Others are available online as indicated below.\n\nFeel free to watch videos alone or with classmates/groupmates (in the latter case, the time spent together should not be understood as going toward fulfilling the study group meeting requirement).\n\nJournal-keeping\n\nWould-be serious students are expected to begin at once keeping their own personal 9.68 13 Journal. It is up to you to determine what to put into it, but it is also incumbent upon you to make clear to each other and to us the form that your Journal will take and the manner in which you propose to keep track of and evaluate the quality of your 9.68 experience, including (but not necessarily limiting yourself to) the account of the quality and amount of the time and effort that you will actually be putting into 9.68.\n\nArguably, we don't really know what we think and feel until we hear (or read) what we have to say (or write). If you are to do some learning in this class, and want to be in a position to formatively and summatively evaluate it, you'd better start keeping track of the experience. You are advised to get yourself a hard-bound \"composition book\" in which to make regular entries. If some would prefer to use a portable computer and electronic workfile we will need to have some further discussion before accepting that as a substitute for a hardcopy notebook. If you decide to keep part of your journal electronically, it makes a difference whether or not you also maintain a hard copy version. Searching the web for \"keeping a journal\" is a good way to find links that discuss the benefits of diligent journal keeping.\n\nAt the very least, a journal devoted mainly to this class will assist you in keeping track of your own progress through the 9.68 learning experience. It will also enable you to formulate pertinent comments and/or relevant questions for study group and/or classroom discussions. In this way, the quality of your interventions in the proceedings will be enhanced and likewise will the quality of class and group discussions. Use your Journal as a place to jot down \"random\" ideas and questions that may come to mind while you are reading (and at other times). Journal entries will also be useful in planning and writing assigned reaction papers. Use your journal as a place to keep track of your thoughts and feelings about the class, the instructors, your classmates and groupmates, the form and content of the subject matter, and the relevance of the collaborative learning process to you.\n\nIt is important for all of us to take this personal aspect of the workload seriously. We will not normally require you to submit your journals to us for examination. However, it is incumbent upon \"serious\" students to keep it handy, to use it consistently, and to have it in hand at all 9.68 activities (class and study group meetings, fieldtrips, etc.) Get used to using it on a regular basis. Our aim is to encourage you to feel safe enough to take some real-world personal risks without fearing unwanted self exposure.\n\nThe only foreseeable circumstances under which we would be inclined to ask to see the contents of your journals would be in the unlikely event that you end up feeling or believing that our evaluation of the quality of your performance (as reflected in the final letter grade assigned to you by us) significantly underrates the quality of your actual performance and this becomes a seriously contested issue between us.\n\nIn evaluating your 9.68 performance, we will generally rely on a five-point scale as specified in the MIT course catalog (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor or failing). It's the amount and quality of your own personal participation that matters!\n\nKeeping a Timesheet\n\nMany people find this a difficult discipline to adopt, but our experience tells us that it is very important to keep track of your own performance. To help you monitor day-to-day, week-to-week, quantitative/qualitative overall time and effort of your 9.68 performance in real time, a printed form is appended. You should make entries no less frequently than three times per week, even if you need to consciously force yourself to do so. Learn to use it conscientiously: make timely and truthful entries and bring it with you to class and be prepared to make it available for occasional inspection.\n\nWriting Reaction Papers\n\n\"Everything that is said is said by someone.\" Papers will normally be 1-2 pages in length on topics to be assigned. You are responsible for printing your own papers. Insofar as possible, all assignments and reaction papers for 9.68 should be written in the voice of the first person singular and be the product of your own mind and hand (mens et manus). Please do not misunderstand, we are not trying to discourage you from consulting or discussing or quoting from or otherwise relying on the work of others. On the contrary, conscientious reliance on the work of others is both a necessary and a desirable hallmark of all serious scholarship. Insofar as the views of others are relevant in this connection, you should feel free to use their ideas and words as frequently and freely as necessary; just make it a point to acknowledge your sources in each and every case.\n\nA Caveat: The advent of the internet and the ease of access to information of dubious credibility via the world wide web presents us with the problem (to put it crudely) of \"distinguishing shit from shinola.\" Some entries (not to mention whole web pages) are here today and gone tomorrow. And some are extremely misleading. It is advisable to be duly cautious in evaluating such information. You will surely get into trouble in this regard if you don't carefully check and cross-check both the credibility of the source and the validity of the information.\n\nPlagiarism\n\nIntellectual property law defines it as a form of grand theft, and in the context of academic life, borrowing words and phrases - whole paragraphs, even - without properly acknowledging your source is the kind of larceny that poses a perpetual threat to the integrity of serious scholarship. Do you understand this? You are probably not the first or only one who has come to hold more or less strong opinions of the kind you are endeavoring to articulate. Sometimes it seems like something you read has an unmistakable ring of truth for you or someone else seems to have already put into words something very like what you believe to be your own present conclusions. That's ok. Use your own words and voice, insofar as possible. If you feel your thesis would be strengthened by weaving into it the eloquent testimonies of others, including recognized authorities, that's perfectly OK too. Feel free to copy or quote whole sentences (paragraphs, even) from the written or spoken work of others as need be. But, whenever you do so, make sure that you use \"quotation marks\" and fully cite the sources that you're borrowing from.\n\nPaper Chase Format\n\nAssigned reaction papers and other submitted texts are to be conventionally footnoted (if necessary), carefully composed, typed, and proofread. The instructors may sometimes ask your permission to redistribute submissions so that each of your papers may be read/reviewed and commented on by one or more of your classmates/study-group mates. Please, submit no handwritten papers unless absolutely necessary and unavoidable (and approved by us).\n\nUnless otherwise arranged in advance, all students will personally submit each and all of their own assignments to the instructors per their request, by hand, and in hardcopy form, at our weekly class meetings. Please, no proxies. The use of group-mates as surrogates to hand in your hardcopy in you're absence is not permitted, except by prior arrangement.\n\nIdeally, your scheduling of tasks will permit you to develop a routine in which reaction papers are drafted in a timely way and can be shared among study group members, we also want to afford opportunities for you to give/receive constructive feedback to/from groupmates and classmates before submitting your own final versions to the instructors.\n\nExcept for the final term paper (see below) no letter or number grades will be assigned to the written work that you turn in. However, it is our intention to carefully and completely read all timely submissions and to provide prompt and constructively critical feedback, in writing, on the quality of content and form at or before the relevant class session. Tardy submissions will be received and recorded as such and may be returned unread.\n\nWhat is Collaborative Learning?\n\nWe define the groups that we have randomly formed (and their individual members) as 9.68 subsystems. This leads into a discussion of the \"systems approach\" to be taken. At the outset, a distinction needs to be drawn between cooperative and collaborative learning. See, e.g.\nTough Questions: \"What's the difference between collaborative and cooperative learning?\"\n\nWe aim to create a classroom environment conducive to meaningful collaborative learning. We hope and expect that each and every one of you will find it both fun and informative--a quality learning experience.\n\nQuality collaborative reaction papers (and term papers/proposals explained below) are welcome; however, don't be tempted to engage in collaborations with expectations conducive to mere dilution. Quite the reverse should be the case: these should be meaningful concentrations of effort all-around. Several heads are only better than one if there is no freeloading and if all members are \"operating on all cylinders\". To be worthwhile, the process of producing collaborative projects or papers should involve more than merely stitching together a series of separate sentences written by different people. Meaningful collaboration means working together to achieve a high degree of effectiveness through constructive interdependence. Accordingly, expect it to require significant cooperation between and among authors for papers to exhibit a high level of internal consistency, coherence, conciseness and continuity.\n\nPlanning/Producing End-of-Term Project or Paper\n\nThis can be on almost any topic and can take almost any tangible form (which must include documentation), provided that its form and content be clearly and coherently relevant to the subject matter dealt with in 9.68. Generally speaking, the choice of topic should be based on your own personal/social (e.g. academic/professional) experience and interests. It is up to you to show in your proposal how what you want to do relates to an aspect or aspects of the material dealt with in this class during the term.\n\nTerm project/paper proposals will be submitted for prior approval. Proposals (not to exceed 2 pages in length) are to be turned in via the instructor before class session 10 (no class on that day). Proposals will be reviewed and returned to you with comments within 5 days. Unless other arrangements are made beforehand, term papers are not to exceed 15 double-spaced pages in length, including notes and references. The deadline for submission and verbal presentation of fully completed term projects/papers is the beginning of the final regularly-scheduled class (i.e. Class session 14). Extensions will be granted only by prior arrangement and only under extreme circumstances.\n\nInterim and Final Grades\n\nFinal grades will be based on the instructors' evaluation of the quality of individual term- long performance in all aspects of the subject including our assessment of the timeliness, conscientiousness, and skill with which assignments have been undertaken and completed, and our perception of the overall quality of your (1) written work, (2) study group involvement, (3) classroom participation (in general) and (4) final term paper/project (in particular).\n\nA Final Note About the 9.68 Learning Process\n\nEach element of the curriculum is intended to be approached in a particular way--with everyone encountering each activity in the same sequential order.",

If done conscientiously, this experience of active\nparticipation and \"self-observation\" will help you (and us) to formatively and summatively evaluate your own\nperformance in this class.\n\nHINTS: Among other things, use this timesheet to keep track of such things as: the amount and quality (or lack\nthereof) of your preparation for participation in class and study group meetings, the conscientiousness, promptness\nand duration of your attendance at and the quality of your participation in all officially required 9.68 activities;\namounts and levels of quality in performance of tasks (e.g. \"seriousness\" of study: are you doing and understanding\nall the assigned readings? participating in group and classroom discussions? honestly endeavoring to enhance the\nquality of your own and others learning experience? attentively and critically viewing all the assigned films? How\nabout the quality and timeliness of the reaction papers that you've written and turned in? Are you conscientiously\nkeeping a journal? etc. etc. etc.\nPhase 1 Begins\nTues.

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nDepartment of Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n9.68 -- Spring 2013\n\naffect/effect\n\nNo wonder people are confused. There are four distinct words here.\nOne problem arises when people confuse the first spelling with the second.\nWhen \"affect\" is accented on the final syllable (a-FECT), it is a verb meaning \"have an influence on\": \"The\nmillion-dollar donation from the coal company did not affect my vote against the Clean Air Act.\"\nWhen you affect a situation, in the foregoing sense, you are having effect(s) on it.\nIn 9.68, our much more specialized - and rarer -- main meaning of affect is indicated when the word is accented\non the first syllable (AFF-ect). In this case the word is used to denote a realm of mental activity in which things\nand events and states of affairs take on some \"evaluative\" or \"emotional\" or \"motivational\" or \"feeling\" or\n\"value-laden\" aspects. Considered in this way \"affect\" (along with cognition and behavior) is a basic aspect of\nwhat is commonly called \"human nature\".\n\"Effect\" too can be two different words. The more common one is a noun denoting something that is or has\nbeen \"caused to happen\": \"The effect of leaving the stove on with the flue closed was that the house filled with\nsmoke.\"\nThe less common is a verb meaning \"to initiate or create\": \"We're trying to effect a change in the way you think\nabout these two sets of terms and concepts .\"\nNote especially that the proper expression is not \"the new regulations will take affect\" but \"...take effect\"--\nmeaning \"to go into effect; become effective; The effect of the new regulations will be to affect our behavior.\"\nWho ever said that proper English usage is simple, logical and straightforward?\nSimply memorize the foregoing distinctions and let's all get on with our \"inquiry into values.\"\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.68 Affect: Neurobiological, Psychological and Sociocultural Counterparts of \"Feelings\"\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Case-to-case variations are to be\nexpected.\nMODELS OF INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT\nSHAKESPEARE\nAs You Like It\n(II, vii, 139)\nAll the world's a stage,\nAnd all the men and\nPHYSICAL /\nBIOLOGICAL\nFREUD\n(psychosexual)\nERIKSON\n(psychosocial\ndevelopment -\nviewing persons\nin-contexts)\nwomen merely players.\nThey have their exits\nand their entrances,\nAnd one man in his time\nplays many parts,\nHis acts being seven ages.\nFAMILY\nFamilies are transgenerationally pro\nduced and propagated human social\nsystems whose main modes of organi\nzation and development might reason\nably be expected to parallel generally\nthose in other human systems at both\nthe individual and the social levels.\nLet's agree to take the prototypical \"fa\nmily life cycle\" as a process involving\nthree successive generations, and to\nidentify its beginning with the coming\ntogether of two young persons. Having\nreached, say, the GENITAL STAGE of psy\nchosexual development (as depicted in\nthe columns to the left) they meet at a\npoint in their lives at which (neuro-bio\npsycho-socio-culturally speaking) both\nare ready, willing and able to differen\ntiate enough from both their families\nof origin and their current peers in or\nder to form a family unit of their own.\nThe point at which „boy meets girl\"\nbegins a process of courtship and indi\ncates the start of a new family system\nbuilding process - which may take a\nvariety of trajectories. The following\nentries trace a typical trajectory from\nthe moment of courtship until the\ndeath of both spouses.\nOTHER GROUPS\nAs this entire document attests, models\ninvolving stage or phase theories fig\nure prominently in our efforts to com\nprehend the organization and devel\nopment of human social systems at all\nlevels of size and complexity. It should\nby now be clear that the organization\nand development process has some\ngeneric features - to be expected in\nall human social systems.\nLet us therefore take 9.70 as a close-to\nhome test case. Parallels to Freud's and\nErikson's developmental tasks and cri\nses will be emphasized. Can we identify\nany of the stages or phases of devel\nopment through which our own 9.70\ncollaborative learning system has been\nand is in process of passing? Please\ncompare and contrast the following\naccount with your experience as a par-\nticipant/observer in/of the organization\nand development of the 9.70/03 col\nlaborative learning system. You should\nalso feel free to consider whether this\naccount appears to you to be applica\nble to the task of understanding the\norganization and development of\nother human social systems.\nBIRTH-3 MONTHS:\nORAL PHASE:\nINFANCY:\nSTAGE I:\nSTAGE I: PREAFFILIATION:\nAt first the infant,\nMewling and puking\nin the nurse's arms.\nhuman infant exhibits\nextreme neoteny (is\nborn in a relative state\nof neurobiological,\npsychological and soci\nocultural immaturity\nin comparison to many\nother mammals); may\nbe early defined by\ncaretakers as \"easy\" or\n\"difficut\"; \"fussy\" or\n\"calm\"; sleeps a lot; its\nnervous system is\nanatomically and phys\niologically \"incom\nplete\"; it is relatively\ninsensitive and unre\nsponsive to environ\nmental changes (nois\nes, etc.); early reflexes\ninclude sucking, tonic\nneck, grasping, etc.;\nhead needs to be\nexternally supported;\ngaze alert...\nContext/Focus: feed\ning; mouth/breast\nunable to distinguish\nbetween self and other,\nand between internal\nand external stimuli /\nsensations; net affirma\ntive maternal responsi\nveness to needs (if con\nsistent and neither ex\ncessively harsh nor un\nduly permissive, encou\nrages infant to assume\na \"psychological set\" of\ntrustful passivity=\"op\ntimism\"); net negative\nmaternal responsiveness\nto needs or net incon\nsistency is liable to be\nexperienced negatively\nby the child (nonver\nbally) as aversive or\npainful, thus encour\naging infant to assume\na \"psychological set\"\nof mistrustful passivity\n= \"pessimism\"\nSPHERE OF SIGNIFI\nCANT SOCIAL RELA\nTIONS:\ninfant and primary\ncaretaker (usually bio\nlogical mother)\nMAIN DEVELOPMEN\nTAL TASK:\nto get needs (mainly\noral/nutritive) met;\nMAIN DEVELOPMEN\nTAL CRISIS:\nbasic trust vs. basic\nmistrust;\nFAVORABLE OUT\nCOME:\ndrive and hope\nUNFAVORABLE OUT\nCOME:\napathy and fearful\nness; autism; paranoia\nThe coming together (\"engagement?\")\nis an encounter (negotiation process)\nin which the two individuals must\nsomehow reconcile many and varied\ntraces of their respective (and collec\ntive) pasts - including attitudes toward\nmarriage and family that have been\nshaped by their respective experiences\ngrowing up in their own families of\norigin. Each arrives at this point with\nmore or less different worldviews, val\nuesystems and lifestyles. Typically, this\npart of the process is marked by an\ninterplay of \"approach/avoidance\"\nbehavior by both partners, and by\n\"family problems\" traceable to differ\nences, disparities and disapprovals on\nall sides. This initial \"entry\" phase\ninvolves the working out of basic\ntrust/mistrust issues. From a structur\nal/developmental point of view, can it\nbe seen as a counterpart of the devel\nopmental processes described immedi\nately to the left and right of this col\numn?\nConsider the situation of an MIT\nundergraduate student poised, so to\nspeak, at or before the actual point of\nentry into a particular classroom on\nthe first day of a new spring term at\nMIT. What social influences are play\ning upon her or him? Has s/he\narrived, at least at a provisional deci\nsion to consider committing to this\nclass? Given that this one was chosen\nfrom among a number of other possi\nble HASS elective classes to attend, are\nthere still likely to be some unresolved\ncommitment issues? How about per\nsonal and social demand characteris\ntics of the upcoming semester? Is s/he\noperating under any significant aca\ndemic/extracurricular constraints/ fore\nseeable time conflicts? How (in what\nways) and how much (to what extent)\nis her/his readiness, willingness and\nability to act conditioned and con\nstrained by social influences arising\nfrom a tension between having some\ngenuine personal and social interest in\nbeing a serious student of the subject\n\npage 2 of 6\nMODELS OF INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT\nMODELS OF FAMILY AND GROUP DEVELOPMENT\nSHAKESPEARE\nPHYSICAL /\nFREUD\nERIKSON\nFAMILY\nAs You Like It\nBIOLOGICAL\n(psychosexual)\n(psychosocial\ndevelopment -\n3-6 MONTHS:\nviewing persons-\ngaze follows moving\nin-contexts)\nobjects; eyes focus;\nsmiles; responsive to\nmother's face, hand/\nmouth activity; head\nerect; social respon\nsiveness; laughter; eye-\nhand coordination;\norality; binocularity;\nsits supported; legs\nbear weight; reaches;\nlocalizes sounds;\nexplores; cries easily\nOTHER GROUPS\nbefore us and desiring to pursue,\ninstead, some other competing inter\nests?

Ideally\n(but not invariably) the new relation\nship is based on trust built up in the\ncourse of the preceding set of more or\nless explicit negotiations. Not atypical\nly, this is a point at which unresolved\n(and perhaps transgenerationally\n\"inherited\") issues of power and con\ntrol come to the fore. As each partner\nstruggles (in his/her own habitual way)\nto realign connections/separations\ninvolving previous social relations\n(including families of origin), a further\nmutually and reciprocally acceptable\ncycle of conflict and reconciliation of\ndifferences necessarily takes place.\nAmong the problems commonly\nencountered at this stage may be\nmentioned: residual ambivalence con\ncerning loyalties to families of origin;\nissues of \"commitment,\" distance reg\nulation, sexual adjustment and disap\npointed initial expectations.\nAmid continuing approach/avoidance\nconflicts, one enters the place. Safely sea\nted and beginning to settle in, the pros\npective participant is now concerned\nabout personal safety and security is\nsues. What will the class will be like?\nWill it be a fun? Who are the instruc\ntors? Who are the other people here?\nWill the workload be heavy? What will\nI need to do to get through (or ace) it?\nHow much time and effort will I have\nto put into it? Will I get what I want out\nof it (gradewise and otherwise)? Will I\nhave a good learning experience?\nHere, as a rule, approach/avoidance\nconflict gradually gives way to \"atten\ntive exploration\" with a view toward\nresolving some of the basic trust/mis\ntrust issues that must be dealt with in\nmaking even a provisional commit\nment to the process of becoming a\nmember of the group. The underlying\nand frankly self-centered question at\nthis point is, \"What's in this for ME?\"\nAssuming that the goal is to develop a\nrelatively open and cooperative (as com\npared with closed and competitive)\nlearning situation (which is our stated\naim), it is appropriate at this point for\nleadership: - to allow - indeed, to sup\nport - the need for group members to\nmaintain their distance; - to let them\napproach at their own speed, while at\nthe same time inviting trust; - to facil\nitate exploration of substantive curricu\nlar topics while stimulating/entertain\ning discussion of commitment issues;\n- to provide information regarding the\ndemand characteristics of the situa\ntion, goals and objectives. The likeli\nhood of dropouts is quite high here.\n\npage 3 of 6\nMODELS OF INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT\nMODELS OF FAMILY AND GROUP DEVELOPMENT\nSHAKESPEARE\nAs You Like It\nPHYSICAL /\nBIOLOGICAL\nFREUD\n(psychosexual)\nERIKSON\n(psychosocial)\nFAMILY\nOTHER GROUPS\n18-36 MONTHS:\nANAL PHASE:\nTODDLER:\nSTAGE III:\nSTAGE III POWER AND CONTROL:\ncontinuing postnatal\nmyelinization of spinal\ncord; capacity for\nbladder/bowel control\nretentiveness/explo\nsiveness; possessive\nness; anal zone\nbecomes focus in con\nnection with \"power\nand control\" issues in\nconnection with toilet\ntraining and/or matu\nration; child experi\nences pleasure from\nanal \"holding in\" and\n\"letting go;\" control\nling/appropriately\nreleasing urine and\nfeces and, by exten\nsion, hygiene/cleanli\nness become issues;\nbecoming independ\nent requires discipline\nand self-control;\n\"learning styles\" begin\nto emerge with self\ndevelopment and\ninteractions with oth\ners sowing seeds of\nfuture mental/behav\nioral patterns; for\nexample: in the\nextreme, either \"obses\nsive/compulsive\" and\n\"impulsive/hyperac\ntive\" behavior may\ndevelop out of early\nexperiences with\nthings and other per\nsons (psychoanalysts\nare thus intensely\ninterested in what they\ncall \"object relations\"\n(including relations\nwith both parents &\nextended family)\nSPHERE OF SIGNIFI\nCANT SOCIAL RELA\nTIONS:\nchild and parents;\nnuclear family\nMAIN DEVELOPMENTAL\nTASK:\nto learn to hold on\nand to let go\nMAIN DEVELOPMENTAL\nCRISIS:\nautonomy and self\nesteem vs. shame and\ndoubt\nFAVORABLE OUTCOME:\nsense of self-control\nand will power\nUNFAVORABLE\nOUTCOME:\nresulting from parental\npermissiveness: prob\nlems in management\nof aggression; result\ning from parental\nover-restrictiveness:\nextreme obedience to\nauthority; conformity;\nneed for approval;\nshame, doubt; fear of\nloss of power and con\ntrol\nWith the birth of a child, the family\nundergoes a transition from a dyad to\na triad. Here the focus of negotiation\nshifts to issues of parental interde\npendence in the face of mutual\nresponsibility for the well-being of a\nhighly dependent new family mem\nber. The new parents must concurrent\nly adjust to big changes in their rela\ntions with each other as well as their\nconjoint responsibility for an extreme\nly needy infant; common issues at this\npoint in the process include increased\nfeelings of abandonment and/or fear\nof the loss of the other's love by one\nor both of the partners.\nOnce their initial commitments to\nmembership in a group have been\nmade, prospective (now provisional)\nmembers must come face to face with\nthe reality of the group and begin to\nnegotiate various issues with each\nother within it (e.g. determining the\nparameters of their individual and col\nlective responses to the demand char\nacteristics of the unfolding situation).\nWhat is really going on here? Who is\nin charge? How do I fit into this arran\ngement? What is my status/role here?\nWhat am I supposed to be doing, thin\nking, learning? Do I like it? Notice\nthat these questions are only slightly\nless self-centered in topic and tone\nthan the basic trust/mistrust questions\nlisted above.\nThis is a phase of the process in which\nmembers of a group-in formation must\nneeds struggle with each other and\nwith the nominal leadership (where\nsuch exists) to arrive at some \"definition\nof the situation\" that is reasonable and\nworkable for them, both individually\nand collectively.

The likelihood of drop\nouts continues to be quite high here, as\nis the probability of frankly hostile, ag\ngressive, and negative behavior toward\nthe group development process itself\nand those responsible for imposing it.\nNot uncommonly, the effort to gain a\ndegree of power and control leads to\nproposals to formalize the proceedings\nby enacting rules, regulations, voting\nprocedures, etc. The result of following\nthese leads is invariably the establish\nment of a \"zero-sum\" game in which\nevery disagreement is \"resolved\" by ha\nving some winners and some losers.\nDuring this rather chaotic phase, a lea\ndership aiming for a more \"win-win\"\napproach needs to focus on allowing\nresistance to be expressed and rebel\nlion to be developed within limits con\nducive to the protection of individual\nrights and general safety.

If and when addition\nal offspring arrive, problems come to\ninclude sibling rivalries and the differ\nential treatment of relatively preferred\nand rejected children.\nAmid continuing normative and mem\nbership performance crises (e.g.\ntrust/mistrust; power/control) an\nunmistakably increasing sense of\nbelonging, interdependency, involve\nment, mutuality and goal orientation\nbegins to emerge. (In the context of\npast 9.70 classes, this has tended to\nemerge first and for most individu\nals/peers at the level of the study\ngroup. At the level of the class-as-a\nwhole, intimacy and task orientation\nare more difficult to achieve; they not\nonly usually take much longer to\ndevelop but also are somewhat less\nstrong. Activities become increasingly\nemotion-laden (meaningful) and the\nfocus of the struggle shifts. Instead of\nbeing directed against the process and\nthe leadership, it begins to be increas\ningly aimed at the attainment of more\nsubstantive goals: e.g. a degree of\nmastery of the subject matter. There is\nincreasing evidence of individual and\ncollective competence; a growing abil\nity to make plans and to carry them\nout (albeit not without considerable\nintellectual and emotional turmoil). In\ncontinuing pursuit of an open and\nnegotiable learning process, the sys\ntem as a whole should be steered\nthrough a supportive and flexible\nseries of tasks and activities while con\nstantly discussing and attempting to\nclarify the thoughts and feelings (both\nnegative and positive) that are being\nengendered. Power and responsibility\nfor directing the group formation\nprocess must continue to be shared in\nthe face of fluctuating individual and\ncollective performance.\nesteem\n...Then the whining\nschoolboy,\nwith his satchel\nAnd shining morning\nface,\nCreeping like a snail\nUnwillingly to school.\n\npage 5 of 6\nMODELS OF INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT\nMODELS OF FAMILY AND GROUP DEVELOPMENT\nSHAKESPEARE\nPHYSICAL /\nFREUD\nERIKSON\nFAMILY\nOTHER GROUPS\nAs You Like It\nBIOLOGICAL\n(psychosexual)\n(psychosocial)\nSTAGE V: DIFFERENTIATION/\n12-18 YEARS:\nPUBERTY:\nADOLESCENT:\nSTAGE V:\nINTEGRATION:\n...And then the lover,\nSighing like a furnace,\nWith a woeful ballad\nMade to his mistresses\neyebrow.\n...Then a soldier,\nFull of strange oaths\nand bearded like the\npard.\nJealous in honor,\nsudden and quick in\nquarrel,\nSeeking the bubble\nreputation\nEven in the cannon's\nmouth.\npuberty; major growth\nspurt occurs earlier;\ngradual/sudden\nappearance of second\nary sexual characteris\ntics; increasing differ\nentiation/integration of\npersonal mental and\nbehavioral characteris\ntics (attitudes, beliefs\nand values, actions,\npractices) characterize\n\"adolescence\"\n18-30 YEARS:\npeak of physical devel\nopment and sexual\nactivity\nreturn or reactivation\nof phallic phase cou\npled with sexual matu\nration; depending on\nprior experience\nacquired in earlier\nstages, narcissistic\nobject love (see\nShakespeare's descrip\ntion) may or may not\nbecome focus\nGENITAL STAGE:\n(early adulthood):\ndepending on prior\nexperience acquired in\nearlier stages, narcis\nsistic object love (or its\nequivalent) may or\nmay not be increasing\nly supplanted by cou\nplings involving more\nmutual and reciprocal\nrelations; conflicts\nbetween dependence\nupon and independ\nence from family of\norigin\nSPHERE OF SIGNIFICANT\nSOCIAL RELATIONS:\npeer groups; same\nand opposite sexes\nMAIN DEVELOPMENTAL\nTASK: to be/become\noneself; to accept one\nself; to share oneself\nwith others\nMAIN DEVELOPMENTAL\nCRISIS: identity vs role\nconfusion\nFAVORABLE OUTCOME:\ndevelopment of situa\ntionally appropriate\nidentity; transition to\nadulthood; explora\ntion, integration or re\npudiation of family cul\nture; sense of devotion\nand fidelity; satisfacto\nry career choice\nUNFAVORABLE\nOUTCOME: inauthen\nticity; delinquency;\nneurosis; psychosis\nYOUNG ADULT:\nSPHERE OF SIGNIFICANT\nSOCIAL RELATIONS:\nadult community apart\nfrom family of origin\nMAIN DEVELOPMENTAL\nTASK: to redefine one\nself in relation to sig\nnificant other(s) (dis\ntance regulation)\nMAIN DEVELOPMENTAL\nCRISIS: intimacy vs.\nsocial isolation\nFAVORABLE OUTCOME:\nsolidarity with others;\nlove; affiliation\nUNFAVORABLE\nOUTCOME: isolation,\nloneliness; alienation;\nanomie\nThe partial exit of the youngest child\nfrom the family and his/her entry into\nthe larger world continues the pattern\nof partial separations; Children in\nschool bring family beliefs and values\nand practices into confrontation (and\nsometimes conflict) with those of the\nsurrounding community with discrep\nancies provoking and increase in ten\nsions within the family.\nAs evidence of competency grows (in\nterms both of intimacy and task orien\ntation), the cohesiveness of the system\nbecomes increasingly apparent as does\nthe somewhat paradoxical fact that\ngroup unity depends on the readiness,\nwillingness and ability of the member\nship to recognize that their own (for\nmerly highly problematic) diversity as\na source of their own great and\nunique strength.

Amid conflicts between them\nand their children, parents revisit or\nrelive their own adolescent conflicts\nwith their parents. This stage or phase\nbegins roughly at the point at which\nthe first child exits the family to estab\nlish an independent household. As\nchildren individuate and become more\nindependent of and separate from\ntheir parents, the latter begin to antici\npate the exit from their living unit of\nthe last child.\nSTAGE VII:\nIn the (once again dyadic) context of\nthe \"empty nest,\" relations between\nthe parents/spouses are further tested.\nThis phase may be marked by\nincreased or renewed closeness\nbetween the parents or it may precipi\ntate what has been called \"the twenty-\nyear fracture.\" The nature and serious\nness of family problems at this stage\ndepends in part on the manner in\nwhich earlier stages turned out (how\nwell or poorly crises were negotiated).\nIt may also be determined by the\nemergence of conflict with new sets of\n\"in-laws\" acquired through children's\nmarriages, by parental illnesses, retire\nments and grandparenthoods, etc.\nSTAGE VIII:\nThe aging parents. Developments in\nlater years - up to and including the\ndeath of one spouse and then the\nother - not unsurprisingly tend to be\nshaped by earlier ones.\nElizabeth Kubler Ross derived from\nher work with terminally ill patients a\nconceptual framework within which\ndying is understandable as a process\ninvolving a more or less clearly recog\nnizable (if not entirely invariant)\nsequence of phases or stages (denial\nand repression, bargaining, anger,\ndepression, and acceptance).\nIn its final phase, the life cycle of a\nhuman social group may be experi\nenced in a similar way by at least\nsome of its members. To be more pre\ncise, members tend to separate from\ngroups in ways that are both disposi\ntionally and situationally influenced.\nThus, all other things constant, our\napproaches to leavetaking tend to be\nfairly consistent for each of us from\none situation to the next. For most\npeople, endings are usually marked by\na mixture of feelings, including sad\nness and happiness, resistance and\nrelief. (It deserves note that, for some\npeople, in at least some situations,\nacquired tendencies toward the denial\nand repression of feeling may blunt\nawareness and expression of both neg\native and positive attitudes toward\nboth the group process and its termi\nnation.)\nInsofar as possible, time should be\ntaken at the end of a group learning\nexperience to review and evaluate the\nexperience as a whole within the con\ntext of a coherent conceptual frame\nwork. This will hopefully prove con\nducive to the development of a valid\nand reliable basis for \"grading\" the\nquality of the performance of the sys\ntem as a whole and of its constituent\nsubsystems (including study groups\nand individuals). Evidence of group\ndevelopment (or lack thereof) may be\nderived from a review and/or re-enact\nment of attitudes and behavior from\nthe point of entry onward (e.g. com\npare/contrast journal entries, minutes,\netc.) from early and later stages.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.68 Affect: Neurobiological, Psychological and Sociocultural Counterparts of \"Feelings\"\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Working Groups\nS. L. Chorover\nafter an article by Gerard M Blair\nrevised (again, in 2011) by SLC for 9.68 and 9.70\n\nGroups are ubiquitous and basic human social systems. Participating with others in the organization and\ndevelopment of goal-oriented groups that \"work\" is a learnable skill . And yet the participants may know very\nlittle about what it means to make a group work well, ethically, and effectively. Further to the point, where\ngroup structure and functions are poorly understood the organization and development process is prone to\nmismanagement. On the other hand, where the \"demand characteristics\" of the situation receive the attention\nthey warrant, the prospects for success are far greater. This brief article--intended to provide some additional\nbackground--looks at a number of basic features of groups and some desiderata of good \"group work.\" It also\nsuggests some ways that you and your groupmates/classmates can foster sustainable (e.g. scientifically credible,\nethically appropriate and practically effective) group organization and development in the present instance.\nIn the beginning (according to the official story) was an individual - and then a pair.\nLet us take this dyad -- this putatively sexually dimorphic and quintessentially human couple; as the\nfirst prototypically human group or social system. Anyhow, they subsequently supposedly\nmisbehaved, were banished and began begetting others. In the second generation, fractious fraternal\ndisagreements broke out and battles were fought over the proper use of natural resources.\nAgriculturalists and pastoralists vied for control over local carrying capacities and the frictions\nassociated with the pressure of living and working together among others of their own kind(s) led to\ntensions within, between and among human individuals and groups. This soon descended into chaos\nand conflict; and ultimately further fragmentation: Cain and his descendants settled in the land of\nNod; and people have been having trouble dealing with differences within, between and among\nindividuals and groups ever since.\nWhy don't we get along? According to one popular view, the problem is that we are (as the old\nsaying has it) \"only human\" and the sources of conflict are allegedly rooted in our flawed \"human\nnature.\" (For a clear and typical example, consider the allegedly inborn and transgenerationally\ninescapable \"inheritance of \"original sin\"; cf. also \"mark of Cain\").\nWe will later examine the question of \"human nature\" quite closely, but, suffice it for the moment to\nsay that an acceptance of this view of anti-social impulses as innate and \"natural\" (in the normative\nsense) has some nontrivial consequences. For, if we choose to accept this \"explanation\", then the\npossibility would appear to be forever forclosed of us ever getting together with a view toward\ncollaboratively confronting \"the problems of our social life\" (as Einstein like to call them Why?\nBecause, if the causes of our failures lie \"in our genes\" and in our essential\nneurobiopsychosocioculturally human nature.\" Then our fate is sealed because -- as the old saying\nhas it: \"you can't change human nature.\") Moreover, if we are doomed by dint of our neurobiological\nmakeup, then there are good grounds for despair, cynicism and nihilism.\nAnd, of course, it is true beyond argument that we humans have all sorts of limitations - including\nsome that are strongly and deeply and deterministically fixed in the neurobiological nature of our\n\nparticular protohominid primate species. (These include, but are not necessarily limited to mental\nand behavioral limitations that condition and constrain our capacity to comprehend and to influence\n(for better or worse) the social situations in which we find ourselves.\nFor present purposes let us focus instead on some features of group organization and development\nthat we can understand and choose to make practical use of in the present context.\nWhen people work together in groups, they often do so without even knowing how to think about\nwhat is actually going on.\nWe begin our study of the organization and development of human social groups by noting that\nthere are several quite separate and distinct sets of issues involved. One set of issues relates to the\ngroup's goal or task and what it will take to get the job done. Frequently this is the only set of issues\nto which group members consciously and explicitly pay any serious attention; the only ones deemed\nworth defining and dealing with.\nThe second set of issues relates to the process of organization and development; the ways in which\nthe group defines and deals with the challenge of transforming a mere collection of separate and\ndistinct individuals into a collaborative unit or learning system\nWhen all members understand and pay due attention to the need for everyone to\nwork well together in creating and maintaining a collaborative context appropriate\nto both task and process, the overall quality of the group's performance can be\nenhanced.\nIn the normal course of events, crises of group development everywhere and always\narise. Where these crises are anticipated and recognized and understood and dealt\nwith for what they are, they can be dealt with in ways that strengthen the group's\nsocial cohesiveness and collaborative task-orientation. Where they are unanticipated,\nunrecognized, misunderstood and unsatisfactorily dealt with the value of the group\nitself may be undermined and its general effectiveness destroyed.\nIdeally, explicit and principled self-management of the group organization and development process\nis everybody's job and basic objectives and methods of procedure must be consensually agreed upon.\nThis will facilitate the communication of negative and positive feedbacks that can help to enhance the\nvalue of the group to its members, complement individual contributions, and lead to outcomes many\ntimes better and more creative than those that might be achievable by its individual members\nworking separately.\nIt is this synergy which gives effective working groups their great value in organizational contexts.\nAnd despite the possible problems that must be faced and the time and effort (and expense) that\nmust be spent facilitating and evaluating the group formation process, the process itself is\nsystematically comprehensible and well worth studying. Indeed, as we encounter it here in the\nevolving pedagogical context of a university classroom the process of group development will be\nfound to possess a characteristic (indeed, \"paradigmatic\") \"structure.\"\nPonder this. You are both participating in and observing an unfolding process that you may expect to\nbe marked, inter alia, by various \"crises\" involving differences between previously habitual personal\n\npatterns of thought, feeling, and action (on the one hand) and the emerging beliefs, values and\npractices prevailing within the group.\nA key to what follows is a simple idea: groups are human social systems with a life cycle. This\nmeans that in a given group formation process, definite organization and development issues may be\nexpected to arise. In most cases, group formation follows a more or less consistent trajectory. Insofar\nas particular moments of crisis are characteristically or normally encountered along the way, the\nprocess from beginning to end can be plausibly parsed into various stages or phases; each marked by\ncertain recognizable normal, natural and predictable \"crises.\"\nAnd herein lies one of the major lessons to be learned in 9.70 and 9.68: the crises that will arise at\nvarious stages of development of this class and its subsystems, have a generic aspect. That is to say,\nthey have their counterparts in many other situations as well. Where the system lifecycle is\nunderstood as such and these normal crises are identified and confronted and resolved as such by the\ngroup itself, they can be made to play a creative role in the system lifecycle. As the semester proceeds,\nyou should find it increasingly easy, instructive, and fun to pay due attention to the group\ndevelopment process. Indeed, in this class, \"process discussions\" in which we reflect on what is\nhappening, who we are, what we have been experiencing, and where we are trying to go, should\nmore and more become - along with \"task discussions\" -- a normal and necessary part of each and all\nindividual and group activities.\nWhat is a Group?\nA number of people working in the same room, or even on a common project might be described as a\nhuman social group. But this way of thinking about it misses the essence of what social psychologists\nmean when they use the phrase \"group process.\"\nFor example, when a class is organized and run in a conventionally hierarchical, autocratic, fully\nscripted, top-down manner, the locus of control is fixed and participants have few if any\nopportunities to interact meaningfully with each other or with the instructors about the form and\ncontent of the work they are responsible for doing or the ways in which they are expected to do it.\nFurther to the point, autocratic (and other hierarchical) modes of organization usually entail an\nextreme division of labor within the group. In the absence of within-group feedback, the group\ndevelopment process may never evolve beyond the most rudimentary levels.\nBy contrast, 9.70 has long been based on the intentional and self-conscious implementation of an\nexplicitly collaborative learning process (This is also true in 9.68 - albeit in different ways and to\ndiffering extents). The collaborative learning system that we aspire to implement here seeks to\nfacilitate the emergence at all levels of its organization and development a genuine spirit of\ncooperation, coordination and a shared commitment to generally applicable and commonly\nunderstood procedures and mores.\n\"Open systems\", are known to increase the likelihood of mutual support (both practical and moral)\nand enhance the quality of group and individual performance.\nIf you think this is an annoyingly nebulous concept, simply compare it to your own experience. For\nexample, try to picture yourself at the point of entry into a conventionally arranged classroom on the\n\nfirst day of classes at the start of (another) new term at the school where you are presently an\nundergraduate.\nWhat are you thinking and feeling?\nWhat are you doing here?\nWhat are your hopes, fears, expectations, assumptions, apprehensions?\nReflect on the influences exerted upon you -- for better or worse -- by the \"social architecture\" (what's\nthis?) of the place when you first come in to it.\nConsider the effect it would have on the quality of your own performance if you were required to\nwork with a colleague or colleagues whose behavior strikes you as unduly self-opinionated,\ncantankerous, loud-mouthed, etc.\nThen contrast that to the effect on the quality of your performance when you are able to work with\nfriendly, open, helpful associates).\n\nWhy Groups?\nGroups are unavoidable in this world. When/if you find yourself actually to be living or working in\none, in some real world situation or context, it may be helpful to know how to think about your\npredicament in scientifically informed, ethically appropriate and practically effective terms. Our\nstudy thus focuses on the play of \"social influences\" in everyday \"situations\" \"contexts\" and \"social\narchitectures.\"(This terminology is important.)\nIn sum, our aim here is to help you to learn how to facilitate the organization and development of\nconceptually credible, pedagogically sound and materially effective learning systems; groupings -\nlarge and small -- that engender and sustain collaboration among diverse talents. Our further hope\nand expectation is that you will find ways of using what you learn here in other contexts where you\nand your co-participants aspire to achieve sustainable, creative and innovative solutions to a wide\nrange of timely and demanding real world human/ecological problems.\nIndeed, in cases where there is no well-established approach/procedure, the wider skill and\nknowledge sets available in a well-working collaborative group give it an edge over the best-\nintended efforts of the brightest, most highly motivated and hardest working collection of single\nindividuals.\nThis is particularly true of groups that operate as self managing units, or are attempting to do so.\nHere the range of knowledge and skills provided by a diverse cohort of randomly assigned members\nand the use of a self monitoring group process (formative and summative evaluation on overlapping\nand alternating and interpenetrating levels and in terms of comparably numerous interacting\naspects) makes it a \"real\" situation as well as a reasonably safe learning context in which student\npower and responsibility are taken seriously and are equitably shared in an authentic, consensually\nvalid and systematic effort to address meaningful human/ecological problems.\n\nEven where a problem could be solved by a single person, there are three main benefits to be gained\nby involving more people - including those who will have to act on or be impacted by the decision.\nFirstly, the motivational aspect of participating in the decision will clearly enhance the acceptability\nof outcomes and implementations (this enhancement is sometimes referred to as \"buy-in\"). Secondly,\nthere may well be factors that all or some of the most directly affected persons and parties\nunderstand better than does any single \"outside\" expert (or collection of experts). Thirdly, questions\nraised and conclusions arrived in a collaborative, hands-on, empirical way, using objective, publicly-\nobservable methods of procedure, enjoy the advantage that tends to accrue to scientific discourse.\nThe authenticity of this approach lies in the fact that the knowledge making process as a whole is\nrecognizably both authoritative and recursively self-correcting.\nThus it happens that even the most elevated leaders of some highly hierarchical systems, such as\nmultinational corporations, have discovered that it is useful to the corporate \"bottom line\" to\npromote increased involvement in group decision making by lower echelons of the workforce. This\nincreased \"buy-in\" to organizational objectives supposedly engenders improved work practices and\ngives people a sense of being able to work together to solve not only work-related problems but\nhuman social problems in general. Workers - at any level - who feel themselves empowered can be\nbetter trusted to become safe and effective executors of delegated authority, as exemplified in the\ncelebrated right of Japanese car workers to halt the production line.\nFrom the individual's point of view, belonging to a group makes it possible to participate in\nachievements well beyond his/her own individual potential. The possibility of creating groups in\nwhich an individual's own self-perceived level of responsibility and authority is enhanced, and\naccountability is shared makes it possible, in turn, for teachers and students in classrooms to provide\nthemselves with learning environments conducive to improved performance and enhanced self-\nesteem coupled with lowered stress. (It seems pertinent to add that the history of the development of\nour collaborative learning system approach attests that some amazingly creative achievements are\nattainable when the mental and behavioral resources present in a single MIT classroom are\neffectively mobilized.)\nGroup Development\nAs already noted, one way of viewing the developmental cycle that groups normally go through is in\nterms of phases or stages. Elsewhere we will consider a more complex and detailed conception\ninvolving additional variables and stages, but, for introductory purposes, the following four stages of\ngroup development can be taken as typical of 9.70 study groups and other comparable human social\nsystems.\n-\nForming\n-\nStorming\n-\nNorming\n-\nPerforming\n\nForming is the stage when the group first comes together. The experience of prospective members is\nlikely to engender attitudes and \"default assumptions\" marked at this point by considerable\nuncertainty, ambivalence and unease and possibly some frank approach-avoidance conflict. (\"Do I\nreally belong here?\" \"Is this a class (group situation, team, living arrangement) from which I can get\nwhat I need for myself?\")\nIn face to face contacts at the outset, everybody tends to be very respectful, wary, well-mannered,\neager to please, polite, and rather dull. Interpersonal diversity within the group is noticed by all but\nfew if any socially significant references to differences are openly voiced.\nWhen and if dissatisfaction is expressed, it is often aimed at other individuals or third parties, the\ntone is usually extremely personal, highly emotionally charged, and generally disparaging. (\"This is\nall a bunch of crap!\" \"The professors are assholes.\" \"Those other study groups suck!\")\nSince the grouping is new, the individual potential participants are understandably guarded in\nopenly expressing their own personal opinions and may generally be expected to be reserved in\naccepting the official party line as real or the remarks of others as genuine. This may or may not be\nparticularly so for members who feel apprehensive or are accustomed to playing more subordinate\nroles.\nUnless these and other unspoken concerns are addressed at the outset, at least some participants may\nhave difficulty feeling fully able to \"fit in\" and may therefore be handicapped in their efforts to\ncontribute effectively.\nAmid the silence of the silent majority, the group tends to defer to the \"leadership\" of the more\noutspoken minority. The group's more talkative members thus initially emerge as \"leaders.\"\nHowever, as we shall soon see, sustainable group leadership is a more complicated business than\nthis. Indeed, one of our aims here is to get you to see leadership not as a personal attribute or\nprerogative of certain presumably \"gifted\" persons who are perceived as \"natural\" leaders, but\nrather as an essential group function: an attribute of the group process itself.\nWhy does this matter? The realization that leadership need not reside in or remain rigidly identified\nwith a particular person or group of persons, not only allows it to be seen as a critically important\nand valuable group attribute or feature, but also suggests or implies that the function can and should\nbe encouraged to move around from person to person within the group. From moment to moment\nand from context to context, as the demand characteristics of the situation change, leadership\nregarding the presenting task, context, or situation should likewise be able to move to wherever the\nbest ideas happen to be at the moment\nStorming is the next stage, After a modicum of commitment all around has been attained, everyone\nbegins to wonder about \"What is really going on?\" \"Who is really in charge here?\" and \"What will\nhappen next?\" Amid uncertainty and a lack of rules or precedents, more or less explicitly fractious\nstruggles over power and control are likely to break out and the boundaries of permissible behavior\ntend to get tested. (As, of course, they must). Factions form, personalities clash, self-esteem and ego-\nstrength is tested, antagonistic positions are taken, contentious attitudes are assumed, and almost no\none concedes a point without first fighting tooth and nail to defend it. Most importantly, with\n\neveryone talking at once, and nobody listening very closely, there is a lot of noise, but very little real\nor meaningful task-oriented or process-relevant communication is going on.\nConfusion and conflict increases between some individuals, while others remain silent. Some who are\nstill (indeed, increasingly) unwilling to talk openly, are feeling frustrated, angry, \"bored,\"\ndisappointed and alienated.\nPerhaps this image of the prototypical human group in formation as a virtual battlefield is a little\nextreme. But if you consider what is going on in some of the groups to which you belong - and if you\nlook beneath the veil of civility - you are likely to see that its no mere bus ride: quite a bit of strongly-\nfelt resentment, cynicism, sarcasm, invective and innuendo is expressed. Is it worth considering the\nhypothesis that much of the vehemence (and violence?) that attends our personal and social lives at\nall levels of organization reflects our failure to take properly to heart some of the basic lessons that\ndecades of action research in the area of group dynamics have taught us (e.g. about taking the other\nperson's perspective properly into account)?\nNorming. At this stage group members (and subgroups) at least tacitly begin to accept the premise\nthat the situation as defined is \"real\" and \"we're all in the same boat.\" It becomes plausible to think\nthat they and their classmates/groupmates may actually be in a position to learn something true and\nuseful by working more effectively together. The in-fighting subsides and a new spirit of co-\noperation becomes evident. Ideally, all members - including those formerly silent -- now begin to feel\nless shy and more secure enough to forthrightly express their own view points. This increase in the\nlevel of participation is further reinforced as formerly unexpressed issues begin to be discussed\nopenly within the group. The most significant improvements at this stage are usually due to the fact\nthat more people are \"trusting the process\" --letting down their own former defenses a bit and\nstarting to listen to and hear what their peers are saying. More efficient work methods become\nestablished, regular tasks are performed in an increasingly routine manner, and the complementarity\nof contributions of different group members begins to be explicitly recognized and valued by the\ngroup as a whole.\nAnd finally: Performing. This is the culmination. Ideally, the group has settled on a mode of\noperation that allows free and frank exchange of views, encourages initiative, and manifests a high\ndegree of mutual support within the group, respect for each other and confidence in the quality of\nconsensual agreement.\nIn terms of performance quality across the lifecycle, many observers agree that groups normally start\nout at a productivity level that is slightly below the sum of the individuals' levels and then drops\nabruptly to a nadir (during the storming) only to climb to higher levels during Norming. Levels when\nPerforming may thus turn out to be well above the start. As already intimated, this elevated level of\nperformance is the main justification for using a collaborative group learning process rather than a\nsimple top-down method of directing a staff.\nGroup Skills\nAs already noted, the group process is comprehensible as involving a series of changes in which a\nloose collection of otherwise unrelated individuals may become a cohesive and effective operating\nunit. A main working hypothesis underlying this work (and an aspect of the \"value added\" that this\n\nclass provides) is that if the group development process is understood, it can be more effectively\nfacilitated and steered.\nThere are two main sets of skills which a group (and its members) must acquire:\n-\nManagerial Skills\n-\nInterpersonal Skills\nEffective facilitation of the group development process is largely a matter of accelerating the\nacquisition of these skills by all members. To be more precise, the imperatives of group development\nrequire decisions to be made about priorities and procedural issues (e.g. whether to continue moving\nin the same direction, to speed up, to slow down, to change direction, etc.)\nIn a collaborative learning system without a designated leader, there are four key leadership roles\nthat must be played by the members if they truly aspire to manage the trajectory and pace of the\ndevelopment process. For shorthand purposes, the roles (or modes of participation) may be\ndesignated as \"moving,\" \"opposing,\" \"following\" (going along; co-moving; co-opposing) and\n\"bystanding\" (observing/interpreting what is going on and providing relevant feedback on\nindividual and group performance).\nAs a self-managing unit, a \"leaderless\" group needs its members perform collectively the functions\notherwise reserved to a designated Group Leader. After all, meetings must be organized, goals\ndefined, resources identified, obstacles anticipated, strategic and tactical planning undertaken,\nperformance monitored, evaluations scheduled and performed, etc. One pitfall to guard against is an\noverly rigid division of labor. It is a notable tendency of study groups - having initially organized\nthemselves in a reasonably amicable way -- to fall habitually into a modus operandi in which the same\nindividual(s) consistently get(s) stuck playing the same role(s), and in which meetings become\nincreasingly banal and routine.\nIdeally all tasks will be appropriately rotated; Members will also make it their business to play each\nof the aforementioned roles as appropriate. (\"leader,\" \"opposer,\" \"follower\" or \"bystander\"). The\n\"trick\" is to learn to be aware of your attitude or \"posture\" regarding the proceedings and to be able\nto shift more or less self-consciously from one role to another in contextually-appropriate ways and in\naccordance with changing circumstances, demand characteristics and definitions of the situation.\n(Here again, the technical terminology is important. Understanding and being able to use these terms\nappropriately should be a goal.).\nJust as it is foolish to expect a single individual to suddenly assume complete managerial\nresponsibility without assistance, so, group cohesiveness is difficult to engender and maintain -\nespecially when there are many self-styled managers (leaders followers, opposers, bystanders) in the\ngroup. Avoid falling habitually into your more well-accustomed and comfortable role(s). In order to\nbe sustainable, the group as a whole must be internally both unified and diverse; members must\ncome up with and agree to go along with an appropriate method of ensuring that all key roles get\nplayed and all key tasks get done by all members as required.\nAs a collection of people responsible for their own respective and conjoint performance, a working\ngroup - in order to be successful -- needs to relearn some basic manners and people-management\nskills. Shyness - if present -- needs to be acknowledged as a problem and somehow overcome. Self-\n\nopinionated, cantankerous, destructive, loud-mouth behavior must give way to less destructive\nmodes of interaction.\nFacilitating Development\nIn a collaborative learning system, leadership is an essential function not to be confused with an\nindividual attribute. Responsibility for facilitation thus must needs be equitably shared and\nperformance formatively evaluated by every member equally and recurrently.\nIt is common practice in many situations to appoint, or otherwise identify someone to serve - at least\ntemporarily -- as the \"group facilitator\". The role of this person is to continually \"bystand\" by\ndrawing attention to group process issues and to and \"lead\" by suggesting ways and means of\nsupporting and enhancing the group's repertoire of knowledge and skills. In this class, we, the\ninstructors, start out by playing this leadership role big time. Please understand: this is merely our\nshort-term strategy. Indeed, the existence of a single identified facilitator (or group of facilitators)\ntends to encourage others to become less proactive and more dependent and deferential, thus\nretarding the group's readiness, willingness and ability to assume collective responsibility for its own\ndevelopment. If this sharing of power and responsibility is recognized and respected and everyone\ncomes to accept it as normal, necessary and just, then the duration and disruptiveness of the\nStorming phase may be minimized.\nThe following set of suggestions may help in group formation.\nFocus\nAs already indicated, the two basic foci should be the group process and the task. If something is to be\ndecided, it is the group that decides it. If there is a problem, the group defines and addresses it. If the\nquality and/or amount of participation of a group member is found wanting, the group has the\npower and responsibility to point it out and ask for change. If inter-individual conflicts arise, their\nexistence should be acknowledged and the issues should be discussed in terms of the task and the\nprocess and in the light of prior agreements. If there is initially a lack of structure and purpose in the\ndeliberations, this lack should be considered in terms of both foci. Likewise if there are disputes\nbetween proponents of alternative courses of action.\nClarification\nIn any learning situation, clarity of communication and coherence of demand characteristics is of\nparamount importance. It is the first responsibility of the group to clarify its own task, and to record\nthis understanding so that it can be constantly viewed in the light of group performance. This means\nhaving, in fact, or in effect, a mission statement which may be revised or replaced, but is always\navailable for review/updating and validation as a focus for the groups deliberations and actions.\nThe \"mouse\" and the \"loudmouth\" roles.\nIn any group, the silence of those who are inclined to remain silent and the talkativeness of those who\ntend to do all the talking are systematically interrelated. \"Shy people\" who tend not to say much\noften turn out to be an under utilized resource for the whole group. By explicitly encouraging active\nparticipation by all, the group reaps the best return for minimal effort. It is the responsibility of \"shy\npeople\" to speak out and to contribute. It is the responsibility of the group to encourage everyone to\n\ndevelop his or her own capacity for leadership by including him/her in the discussion and actions,\nand to provide positive reinforcement each time that happens. Not uncommonly, there may be a\nmember or members who get disproportionate amounts of \"air time\" and whose opinions\ndisproportionately dominate the discussion. It is the responsibility of each individual to consider\nwhether s/he is behaving in such a way. It is the responsibility of the group to help maintain a\nbalanced discussion - to ask excessively talkative members to summarize briefly, and to make room\nfor the expression of other views.\nThe written record\nOften a decision that is made but not recorded will become clouded and have to be re-discussed. This\ncan be avoided simply by recording on a large display (where the group can clearly see) each point of\nagreement as it is arrived at and each decision as it is made. This has the further advantage of\nencouraging the group to summarize its main points of agreement and its main substantive or\nprocedural decisions in a clear and concise form.\nFeedback (negative)\nNegative feedback is essential for learning. Be prepared to stumble and fall occasionally. All criticism\nshould be neutral: focused on the task or group process and not on alleged mental or behavioral\nshortcomings or personality defects of particular people. People who err are not necessarily stupid\npeople. So, rather than calling Johnnie an innumerate moron, point out the error and offer him a\ncalculator. It is wise to adopt the policy of giving negative feedback frequently, gently, and in a\ntimely way -- especially for small things - this can be couched as mutual coaching, and it reduces the\ndestructive impact of criticism when things go badly wrong. Insofar as possible, every criticism\nshould be preceded by something positive and accompanied by a constructive suggestion for\nimprovement. By the same token, those who make suggestions for or against certain courses of action\nought to be ready willing and able to participate in the implementation of their own proposals.\nFeedback (positive)\nIf anyone does something well, praise it. If someone says something that you agree with, let it be\nknown. Not only does this reinforce commendable actions, but it also mollifies the negative feedback\nwhich may come later. Statements or other actions that produce learning, build consensus, or\nenhance progress toward shared goals (e.g. task orientation and/or group process facilitation) should\nbe validated.\nHandling setbacks and failures\nThe long term success of a group depends upon how it deals with moments of failure. It is a very\ncommon tendency to brush off lapses or set-backs and to get on with the next business at hand with\nno more than the briefest and most perfunctory discussion of \"what went wrong\". In terms of group\ndevelopment, this tends to be a counterproductive tendency. Performance failures are learning\nopportunities. Shortcomings should be acknowledged and the reasons for them explored by the\ngroup. This is done not to find fault or to assign blame (for that is shared by the whole group), but\nrather to examine the causes and to devise alternative approaches intended to prevent or avoid\nrepetition. A given mistake should only happen once if it is treated correctly. The group may decide\nto delegate implementation of the agreed-upon alternative approach to the individual or sub-group\n\nthat was responsible for making the original error. This allows the group to demonstrate its\ncontinuing trust in its members and enables the offender(s) to make amends.\nDealing with deadlocks\nIf two opposing points of view are persistently held in the group then an impasse looms and some\naction must be taken. Several possible strategies exist. Each sub-group could be asked to articulate the\nother sub-group's viewpoint in order to better understand it. A search for common ground should be\nemphasized, and the differences viewed as an opportunity to search out a possible middle way or an\nalternative strategy that might bring about a reconciliation. Each position should be evaluated in the\nlight of the group's central mission or task. But firstly the group should decide how much time the\nissue actually merits and then stop the discussion promptly after that time. Then, if the issue is still\nunresolved and not of absolutely critical importance, consider settling the argument with a coin-toss.\nSign posting\nAs each small point is discussed, the larger picture can be obscured. Thus it is sometimes useful for\nthe group to remind itself: this is where we are, that is where we came from, and this is where we\nshould be going.\nAvoiding single solutions\nJust as nominal leaders do not have all the answers, so first ideas are not always best. For any given\nproblem, the group should generate alternatives, evaluate these in terms of the task, pick one and\nimplement it. But most importantly, they must also monitor the outcome, schedule a review and be\nprepared to change the plan in accordance with observed outcomes. (This is formative evaluation, all\nover again).\nSustaining active communication\nMeaningful communication is the conjoint responsibility of both the speaker and the listener. The\nspeaker must acknowledge that s/he has a point of view and should actively endeavor to express\nher/himself in a clear and concise manner. The listener must likewise recognize the influence of\nperspectival factors on his/her perception of what is being said, to actively seek to understand it and\nask for repetition or clarification if unsure. Finally, both parties must be sure that the ideas have been\ncorrectly communicated. It is sometimes wise to test understanding by having the listener summarize\nin his/her own words what has been said.\n\nConclusion\nGroups are like relationships. They can be extremely satisfying and rewarding, but only if you put\nquality time, energy and effort into them in order to make them work.\nIn the classroom and the work place, groups constitute important units of organizational and\nproductive activity whose dynamic nature and creative value are coming to be increasingly\nunderstood. By making the group itself responsible for its own performance, the shared power and\nresponsibility of the members becomes an accelerator for the group development process.\nIn order for the process of its own development to be recognized and explicitly dealt with by the\ngroup, time and resources must regularly be allocated to discussing these issues.

This time, we remain\npretty much outdoors - walking around a particular block in the Back Bay.\n\nThe \"mission\"? Consider it a search for criteria (grounds; a basis) on which to evaluate the \"quality of life\" prevailing in\nthis particular part of the local urban environment.\n\nFIRST: Study the foregoing images. Think about their meaning to you.\n\nFocusing down: At what level of awareness do you register the form and function of the city's streets and sidewalks and\nparks and buildings and pavements?\n\nMonitor and record your thoughts and feelings about being in this environment at this moment. What draws your\nattention? Do you take note of weather, temperature, sounds, sights, smells? people, places, things? vehicles, pedestrians,\ncommercial, residences, office blocks, and other buildings (apartment houses, hotels, cafes, restaurants, churches;\nstorefronts, shops and government offices)?\n\nIn what respects and to what extent are you and the people around you \"all in the same world\"? or \"each in his/her own\nworld\" -- strolling, running errands, doing chores, taking in the sights, shopping, walking, resting, on the job, taking it\neasy? with the possible exception of your classmates, let's assume that the only one seeing and thinking and feeling as\nyou do about your environment is yourself. What are you feeling?\n\nHow do you feel? Are you more comfortable walking along broad public thoroughfares and sidewalks? How do you feel\nwhen entering and traversing narrow urban alleys? What is your \"state of mind\" when crossing the big city's busy streets?\nDo you find it easy or hard to negotiate your way through the helter-skelter of fast-moving vehicular and pedestrian\ntraffic? Do you feel \"at home\" in this neighborhood?\n\nImages removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nAre you familiar with the city's civic amenities (e.g. parklands and public reservations?) How about the availability of\nand ease of access to public toilets and other sanitary conveniences? How good are local and regional transportation\nsystems? Trolleys and Subways and Buses? Do you hear emergency noises? Notice cops on the beat? See security guards\non duty? Can you spot other workers doing their jobs? Bikers and joggers and skaters? Skateboarders? Limousines?\nTaxis? Cars and Vans and Trucks? \"Tourist Ducks\" and \"Sightseeing Trolleys, Horse-drawn Carriages\"? Scooters,\nMotorcycles, Ambulances, Police cars, Fire engines; Where are parking lots and garages? Its metered/unmetered parking\nspaces? (and the relative number and cost thereof) ...\n\nIn its original MIT trial, this walk was taken in the early Spring of 1958 by some 27 subjects -- all of them enrolled in an\nurban studies class. The weather was cold, sometimes sunny, the trees were still bare and there were patches of old snow\non the ground here and there. The walkers - students in an MIT class on city planning -- were instructed to focus their\nattention on the forms and functions of the urban environment, with a view toward helping them to sharpen their\nperceptual and critical abilities, and in the hope of heightening their sensitivity to the natural and architectural\ncharacteristics of the urban surroundings.\n\nWe invite you to take these factors into account. But, the main aim here continues to be to help you to become still more\naware of and more comfortable with the concepts of \"quality\" and \"good\" that we have been exploring and see whether\n(or in what ways) your observations relate to questions that occur to you about human adaptability and the sustainability\nof human/ecological relations as you walk.\n\nSECOND: Take the walk.\nThe exercise begins at the southeast corner of Boylston and Berkeley Streets in the Back Bay.\nIt ends near the intersection of Arlington and Boylston Streets, on a grassy spot in the southwest corner of the Boston\nPublic Garden,. The spot is directly across the street from the Arlington Street Church and opposite the stairway down to\nthe outbound underground T stop on the Green Line.\n\nTo get there from the MIT-Kendall Square T stop take Red Line, inbound 2 stops to Park Street. Follow signs to Green\nLine Westbound, go upstairs and take any trolley two stops outbound to Arlington Street. Exit at front (west) end of\nplatform; there is a stairway/escalator leading up to street level. The block we are about to walk around is not an\nextraordinary one, except perhaps in the sense that it hasn't really changed all that much since Lynch and Rivkin\ndescribed it as follows more than 4 decades ago:\n\n\"It has many typical features of an American shopping street, but with some touches of Boston\ntradition and much physical contrast in small compass. (On the Boylston Street side, the block)\nhas a wide range of offices and middle-income specialty stores, while (the Newbury street side)\ncaters to a wealthier class, with its elegant dress shops, decorators, beauticians, and haberdashers.\nThe Newbury Street shops occupy the ground floors of old, narrow-fronted retail and wholesale\nbusiness buildings, which vary markedly in height. Traffic on both streets is one-way and that on\nBoylston is quite heavy. Between Boylston and Newbury streets is a narrow alley, neither meaner\nnor dirtier than most.\"\n\nSTART: by pausing, for a moment, at the corner of Boylston and Berkeley Street.\nUntil recently, the red brick building across Berkeley Street has been occupied by an upscale men's clothier. It was\npreviously home to the Bonwit Teller Department Store. The building was originally built in 1864 to house a Museum of\nNatural History. A very similar building of comparable style and scale was erected on another site nearby and became the\nfirst home of MIT when first founded as \"Boston Tech.\"\n\nProceed east on Boylston Street to Arlington Street.\nAt the first corner, turn left.\n\nYou are now proceeding north along the west sidewalk of Arlington Street.\nThe first structure on your left is the old brownstone Arlington Street Church (completed 1861). It is one of the first\nbuildings to occupy the newly-filled-in Back Bay lands. Continue walking northwards, past Alley 438 and then turn left\nagain at the next corner.\n\nYou are now proceeding west along the south sidewalk of Newbury Street. Continue walking west to Berkeley Street;\nturn left; walk along the east sidewalk of Berkeley Street, past Alley 438, and back to the starting point. Now retrace your\nsteps halfway along Berkeley Street until you come back to Alley 438. Turn right and follow the alley to its end\n(beginning?) at Arlington Street.\n\nIn this alley, we encounter the \"backsides\" of the \"upscale\" facades of the fashionable Bolston and Newbury Street\nestablishments. Here you are - as an earlier participant put it: \"behind the scenes\" amid the physical \"infrastructure of a\nsystem that puts relatively toney sales assistants and wealthy shoppers out front; homeless people, service workers and\npoorer people way back\". Is that description consistent with your own impressions? Explain.\n\nAfter passing through the alley you are back on Arlington Street; Carefully cross Arlington Street and enter the Public\nGardens. Find a place to sit and reflect on your \"walk around the block.\"\n\nTHIRD: Reflect.\n\n\"The Boston Public Gardens,\" note Lynch and Rivkin, was \"planted in the romantic style\"\n\nWhat is the meaning to you of this denotation?\n\nReview the experience. Pause and take note of relevant details.\nNote the time and date of your excursion. Comment as appropriate on weather and other relevant environmental\nconditions.\n\nHere are some other questions to stimulate and guide your reflections:\n\nHow are you feeling? (Recall what's been said about the influence of attitudes on outcomes.)\nHas the walk added anything to your pre-existing mental model of the city?\nCan you describe the Metropolitan area (or this single one of its urban blocks) as a human/ecological system?\n\nWhen this exercise was originally done, nobody had ever seen any of the striking satellite images of \"the whole earth\"\nthat have become commonplace among us since then. Today, our capacity to visualize our \"homes\" is vastly augmented\nby the accessibility to all of the many programs like \"Google Earth\" and by myriad GPS programs.\n\nNow that it is so easy to visualize our surroundings as if \"in overview\" it has become possible for us to ask: Which images\nbest exemplify your idea of \"home\" in the sense of an actual place?\n\nWhat sorts of things about yourself; about the environment; about yourself in the environment; have you been finding\nyourself paying particular attention to?\n\nWhat is the city as described in terms of major spatial and temporal dimensions? What are it main component systems and\nsubsystems (e.g.) topographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), geopolitical boundaries and relation to local and\nregional watersheds?\n\nWhat are Greater Boston's major watershed units?\n\nIn which watershed(s) do we find\nthe MFA?\nMIT?\nthe block we walked around?\n\nWhy are water and water supplies and watersheds important?\n\nWater is primal. Water quality is constantly threatened by anthropogenic factors.\nFresh water represents only 6% of the volume of the earth's water; the other 94% is salt water.\nA fraction of the earth's fresh water is constantly being recycled. (see \"The Water Cycle\")\nPotable water is an endangered resource.\n\nOf available potable terrestrial water supplies for human consumption, most (get data) is either on the surface or in\nunderground aquifers;\n\nIt makes sense for human social, geopolitical, and economic activities to be organized in terms of shared involvements\nwith local and regional watershed units and underground aquifers.\n\nWe are water, (70 per cent) with a bit of gristle and stardust.\n\nWhat do you know about the source of the water supplies of Greater Boston?\nWhat do you know about the fate of our urban wastewater?\nWhat do you know about the location and condition of our urban wastewater systems?\n\nIn which County is MIT located?\nWhat do you know about Boston's weather, and climate, about its civic and cultural amenities?\n\nWhat do you know about Boston's neighborhoods and suburbs? Its local, regional, county, state, national and global\nmodes of governance? its educational, scientific, medical, religious, legal and social service institutions; its schools and\ncolleges, dormitories, private residences, public housing projects, churches, farms, manufacturing industries, fraternities,\nsororities, zoos, aquariums, museums, movie houses, theatres and concert halls; its clubs, teams, gangs, labor unions, for\nprofit and not for profit corporations, community centers, fitness facilities, clinics, hospitals, health centers) etc. etc.?\n\nWhat do you know about the natural history, topography and development of the city?\n\nWhy is one neighborhood called the \"Back Bay\"?\nWhat was \"Trimount?\" How about \"Boston Neck\"? and \"Gallows Island\"?\nHow extensive is \"Greater Boston\"?\nCan you identify: The Charles River Watershed? Muddy River Watershed? Neponset River? Mystic River? Chelsea\nRiver? Boston Harbor? Massachusetts Bay? The Gulf of Maine International Watershed Area? How do these boundaries\nrelate to present geopolitical borders (e.g. national, state/provincial, regional, county, local ?\n\nWhat about demographic trends past and present? Who were Boston's \"original inhabitants\" and who were its subsequent\nsettlers; how about the city's people and neighborhoods yesterday and today?\n\nWhat are your own home terrestrial coordinates:\nWhat do you know about home water affairs?\n\nBy hypothesis: people quite generally and commonly seek to minimize \"cognitive dissonance\" and to create and maintain\nan optimal modicum of coherence, order, consistency and continuity in their/our everyday lives; in the process, each of us\nmay be said to somehow manage to create for ourselves (whether self-consciously or otherwise) a more or less\ncomprehensive, coherent, orderly, useful and continuous \"cognitive map\" of our surroundings and our own place therein.\n\nHas the shape and texture of your cognitive map been influenced by the field trip experience?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.68 Affect: Neurobiological, Psychological and Sociocultural Counterparts of \"Feelings\"\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Class Meeting 11\n\nDiscussion: \"Fathering the Unthinkable\" - Ethical issues in science and engineering:\nThe case of atomic physics and two physicists - Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg - (co-\ninventors of \"the Copenhagen Interpretation\" of intra-atomic organization) -- on opposing\nsides in WWII.\n\nThe single most awesome manifestation of the power of modern science and technology -- the ultimate\nprototypical prime test case of ethical issues relating to science and society -- came with the creation of\nthe atomic bomb. When the first one -- code named Trinity (see below) -- was successfully test-fired on\ndesert sands outside Alamagordo, New Mexico. J. Robert Oppenheimer, physicist and project director\npublicly celebrated with colleagues. They were happy and proud to have been able to show that it was\npractically possible to unleash the hidden and unimaginably hugely explosive potential energy stored in\natomic nuclei. Brigadier General T.F. Farrell witnessed the blast - \"The effects could well be called\nunprecedented, magnificent, beautiful, stupendous, and terrifying. No man-made phenomenon of such\ntremendous power had ever occurred before. The lighting effects beggared description. The whole\ncountry was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun. It was golden,\npurple, violet, gray, and blue. It lighted every peak, crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with\na clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined...\" More privately,\nOppenheimer recalled an ominous passage in Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: \"I am become Death,\nthe shatterer of worlds.\"\n\nPhoto is in public domain.\n\"Trinity\" Atomic Bomb Test, July 16, 1945, Alamogordo NM. Fireball 16ms after detonation.\n\nThe light from the blast was seen all over New Mexico, and in parts of Arizona, Texas, and Mexico.\nWindows shattered 120 miles away in Silver City, New Mexico, and the shock wave was felt in Los\nAlamos, 230 miles away.\n\nThe yield of the first bomb was estimated to be equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT - 2,000 B-29s worth of\nexplosives. Today's big bombs yield megatons of TNT equivalents (around 1,200,000 tons for the B83\nstrategic bomb).\n\nThe present total global nuclear arsenal is about 30,000 nuclear warheads with a destructive capacity of 5\ngigatons (5,000,000,000,000 tons) of TNT.\n\nPREPARATION:\nREAD: 11-1\nFrayn, Michael, Copenhagen (a play)\nA copy of the text of the play is available for purchase from Amazon.\n\nVIEW: 11-2\nCopenhagen, a BBC television adaptation of Michael Frayn's play, adapted and\ndirected by Howard Davies.\n\nThere is also an interesting BBC Documentary called Copenhagen Fallout, dealing with the same issues.\n\nIt is important to both view the film and read the script of the play! Pay particular attention to how Frayn\nelucidates the interplay of human factors (limitations of perception and vagaries of recollection) with\nsocial (e.g. ethical) and scientific ideas (e.g. relativity, uncertainty, complementarity).\n\nWRITE: Reaction Paper #10\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.68 Affect: Neurobiological, Psychological and Sociocultural Counterparts of \"Feelings\"\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
