      "content": "12.108 Structure of Earth Materials\nI. Lecture 1: Minerals and Symmetry Operations\nDefinition of a mineral\nA mineral is a naturally occurring homogeneous solid usually formed by inorganic processes. It has a\ndefinite chemical composition and a highly ordered atomic arrangement.\nIn detail--\n1. Naturally occurring: Minerals are not man-made, but are produced by natural processes. A diamond\nfound in the earth, for example, is a mineral, but a diamond synthesized in a lab is not.\n2. Homogeneous: A mineral cannot be physically separated into simpler chemical compounds.\n3. Solid: Liquids and gases are not minerals. Water, for example, is not a mineral, but ice is.\n4. Formed by inorganic processes: Petroleum and coal are not minerals.\n5. Definite (but generally not fixed) composition: Minerals can be expressed by chemical formulas, such\nas SiO2 for quartz. However, some minerals like feldspars have variable compositions. The composition\nof plagioclase, for example, ranges from NaAlSi3O8 to CaAl2Si2O8.\n6. Ordered atomic arrangement: Minerals have long-range 3D atom order. Solids like glass that lack\nlong-range atomic order are called amorphous and are not minerals.\nSymmetry\nThe long-range 3D order of minerals may be defined in terms of molecule-scale building blocks that are\narranged in a regular manner. The way these building blocks are arranged is described by symmetry.\nSymmetry not only describes a mineral's atomic order, but also controls physicals properties such as\ncleavage and habit (Neumann's Principle).\n2D Symmetry Operations\nSymmetry operations consist of an element and an operator.\nOperation\nElement\nOperator\nTranslation\nvector\ndistance\nRotation\naxis\n\nangle\nReflection\nmirror\ndistance\nA. Translation\nTranslations of molecule-scale building blocks lead to long-range atomic order. This symmetry operation\nwill be explored in more detail in Lecture 2; this lecture focuses on symmetry operations that don't require\ntranslations.\nB. Reflection\n\nMirror planes are designated by m.\nC. Rotation\nThe angle of rotation α about an axis must be the quotient of 360° and an integer n.\nα = 360°/n\nWhen n = 1, an object is completely rotated about the rotation axis and exhibits 1-fold symmetry.\nWhen n = 2, an object is rotated α = 180° around the rotation axis and exhibits 2-fold symmetry.\nn\nα\nSymmetry\n3-fold\n4-fold\n*will be addressed later\n6-fold\nD. Combined Operations\n\nm\n2mm\n4mm\n3m\n6mm\n(Adapted from Klein and Hurlbut, Jr. Manual of Mineralogy. New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1993. 117)\nD. Inversion\nThe inversion operation inverts an object through an inversion center i. The inverted object is formed by\ndrawing imaginary lines from the original object through the inversion center and out an equal distance on\nthe other side. In two dimensions, the operation is equivalent to a 2-fold rotation. Symmetry about a point\nin three dimensions will be covered in a later lecture.\n\nII. Lecture 2: Translation and 2D Plane Groups\nCrystals are three-dimensional periodic arrays of a group of atoms. This group of atoms may be (SiO4)-4 or\nH2O, for example, and is called a motif. The motif is repeated via vector translations in three dimensions\nand forms a lattice. In earth materials, the translations are on the order of 0.5 to 2.0 nm.\nTranslations and Lattices in 2D\nIn diagram below, the motif is represented by points called lattice points. Note that the environment of\nevery point is identical to that of every other point.\nThe polygon building blocks that compose a lattice are called unit cells. Primitive unit cells contain only\nlattice nodes and multiple unit cells contain an extra node within the cell. The smallest unit cell is called\nthe reduced unit cell\nIn two dimensions, there are only five distinct lattices.\na\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\nb\ng\ng\no\ng\no\ng\no\ng\na\na\na\na\na\nb\nb\nb\nb\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\n(D)\n(E)\ny'\nOrigin\nRow 1\n= 90\n= 90\n= 60\na'\nb'\nb'\nOrigin\nOrigin\nOrigin\nOrigin\nRow 1\nRow 1\nRow 1\nRow 1\n(Adapted from Klein and Hurlbut, Jr. Manual of Mineralogy.

      "content": "Lecture 4: Visualizing Crystal Structures; Pauling's Rules\nWhen the bonding in a crystal is principally ionic, the crystal structure is fairly simple because the ions may\nbe regarded as rigid spheres. The geometry of these rigid spheres is governed by Pauling's rules.\nPauling's Rules for Ionic Structures\nRule 1: Interatomic distances and coordination\nThe distance between a cation and anion is the sum of their radii. The coordination of an ion is determined\nby the radius ratio rule.\nIn detail--\nAn ion in a crystal structure tends to gather as many oppositely charged ions around itself as its size\npermits. The number of surrounding ions is called the coordination number (CN) of the central ion. Large\nions have high coordination numbers because of their large surface areas and small anions have low\ncoordination numbers.\nSince ions tend to surround themselves with as many oppositely charged ions as possible, predicting\ncoordination numbers requires using only the relative size of ions. The relative size of ions is expressed as\na radius ratio.\nR\nRadius ratio = RC / R A\nC is the radius of the cation. R A is the radius of the anion.\nAs shown in the chart below, ranges of radius ratios correspond to certain coordination numbers. Overlap\nand uncertainty arise because treating ions as rigid spheres with constant radii is not a perfectly valid\nassumption. Ions are not spherical and their radii change slightly with different coordination numbers.\nThe geometry of ions about a central ion is visualized as a coordination polyhedron. In mineralogy, these\npolyhedra are usually constructed from the arrangement of anions; cations sit at the center of the polyhedra,\nor may be absent altogether. Coordination polyhedra are constrained by coordination numbers, but only\nuniquely determined by radius ratios and the type of bonding in a mineral.\nRadius\nRatio\nCoordination\nNumber\nIonic Polyhedra\nCovalent Polyhedra\n0 - inf\nLine\n0.155 - inf\nTriangle\n0.225 - inf\nTetrahedron\n0.414 - inf\nSquare\n0.414 - inf\nTetrahedral Pyramid\n0.414 - inf\nOctahedron\n0.529 - inf\nTrigonal Prism\n0.625 - inf\nSquare Antiprism\n0.732 - inf\nCube\n1.00 - inf\nCuboctahedron\n1.00 - inf\nDisheptahedron\nAside on Hexagonal Closest Packing and Cubic Closest Packing\nIn native metals, the atoms are the same size, the coordination number is 12, and the coordination\npolyhedra are either cuboctahedrons or disheptahedrons. These coordination polyhedra are not easy to\n\nvisualize. Playing with layers of identical closest-packed spheres gives a more intuitive feel for their\nshapes.\nOne layer of closest-packed spheres has hexagonal symmetry and triangular depressions.\nPutting another layer on top covers half of the triangular depressions with the bottoms of spheres. The\nremaining depressions are overlain by other triangular depressions.\nThere are two choices about where to put the third layer. It can be stacked so that it superimposes the first\nlayer to form the sequence ABABAB, making an arrangement called hexagonal closest packing (HCP).\nThe coodination polyhedra for HCP are disheptahedra.\n\nAlternatively, the third layer can be stacked so that it does not superimpose the first layer. This\narrangement forms the sequence ABCABC and is called cubic closest packing (CCB). The coordination\npolyhedra for CCP are cuboctahedra.\nRule 2: Electrostatic valency principle\nIn a stable crystal structure, the total strength of the bonds from coordinating ions that reaches the central\nion is equal to the charge of the central ion.\nThe strength of an ion's bond may be expressed as the ratio of its charge (z) to its coordination (CN):\nBond strength = z / CN\nIn other words, ions with high charges that are bonded to few neighboring ions have the high bond\nstrengths. Pauling's second rule says that summing the bond strengths of all the ions coordinated around a\ncentral ion equals the charge of the central ion. It expresses local charge balance in a crystal.\nConsider rutile (TiO2) for example. In rutile, Ti4+ is in octahedral coordination, so its bond strength is\n4+ / 6 = 2/3 +\n** Rule 2 also limits the number of polyhedra that can meet at a point. In silicate minerals, for example, Si\nis found in tetrahedral coordination and its bond strength is 1+. Since oxygen has a charge of 2- , only two\ntetrahedra can meet at a single oxygen.\nRule 3: Sharing polyhedra I\nThe stability of a crystal is decreased when polyhedra share edges. It is decreased even more when they\nshare faces.\nAnion polyhedra that share edges or faces reduce the stability of a crystal because they bring cations closer\ntogether. The closer cations experience more electrostatic repulsion.\n\nRule 4: Sharing polyhedra II\nCations with high valency and low coordination numbers tend to not share their coordinating polyhedra.\nPauling's fourth rule says that highly charged cations will tend to be as far apart as possible to minimize\nelectrostatic repulsion.\nRule 5: Parsimony\nThe number of different kinds of constituents in a crystal tends to be small.\n\"Constituents\" refers to cystallographic sites (ie, coordination polyhedra) and not types of ions.\nAmphibole, for example, can contain as many as thirteen different anions, but has only five distinct\ncrystallographic sites. The number of crystallographic sites is limited because the types of polyhedra that\ncan be stacked together while maintaining crystal symmetry is limited."

      "content": "Lecture 5: Bonding Models\nAtoms or ions in minerals are glued together by electrical bonds that are ionic, covalent, or metallic. The\ntypes and intensities of these bonds in a mineral determine its physical and chemical properties, including\nhardness, cleavage, and conductivity\nIonic Bonds\nIonic Bonding Model\nAtoms have a tendency to achieve a completely filled valence shell like the inert gases. Metals like sodium\ntend to lose electrons to achieve full valence shells, and nonmetals like chlorine tend to gain electrons. The\nprocess of gaining or losing electrons crates ions, and electrostatic forces bring the ions together to form\ncompounds. For example, sodium may lose an electron to chlorine to create Na+ and Cl-, and the\nCoulombic attraction between the resulting ions makes NaCl, or table salt. The attraction between the\noppositely charged ions constitutes the ionic bond.\n-\nNa Æ Na+ + e\nCl + e-Æ Cl-\n\nCl- + Na+ Æ NaCl\nThe strength of an ionic bond depends on the distance between ions (r) and the product of their charges (q).\nThe mathematical expression for ionic bond strength is very similar to the expression for the Coulomb\nforce:\nBond strength ∝ (q1q2)/r\nProperties of Ionic Materials\nIonically bonded materials usually have moderate hardness and fairly high melting points. They are\ngenerally soluble and are poor conductors of electricity because their constituent ions are fairly stable and\nneither lose nor gain electrons easily. They are usually highly symmetric and nondirectional (isotropic),\nbecause their cations tend to evenly surround themselves with as many anions as space permits.\nElectronegativity and Predicting Bond Types\nThe ability of an atom to lose or gain electrons is called electronegativity. Electronegativity is expressed as\na dimensionless number between 0 and 4.1, with low numbers indicating a tendency to lose electrons and\nhigh numbers indicating a tendency to gain electrons. Electronegativity helps one predict the bonding type\nbetween two elements. For example, when an element with low electronegativity bonds with an element\nwith high electronegativity, the bond is typically ionic. When two elements with high electronegativities\nbond together, the bond is typically covalent.\nCovalent Bonds\nCovalent Bonding Model\nWhereas atoms exchange electrons to achieve a full valence shell in ionic bonds, they share electrons in\ncovalent bonds because neither atom has a strong tendency to give them up completely. For example,\nwhen an atom of chlorine bonds with another atom of chlorine, the result is an overlap of the atoms'\nelectron clouds that simultaneously fills the valence shells of both atoms. Covalent bonds are expressed\nsymbolically with Lewis notation, in which valence electrons appear as dots surrounding an atom. For\nchlorine gas, this looks like:\n\nThe number of covalent bonds an atom can form depends on the number of electrons needed to form a\ncomplete valence shell. For example, carbon and silicon can both form up to four covalent bonds.\nProperties of Covalent Materials\nCovalent bonds are the strongest of the chemical bonds. Covalently bonded materials generally have very\nhigh melting points and are generally insoluble. They typically do not conduct electricity as solids or in\nsolution. Because covalent bonds are highly directional, covalently bonded materials tend to have less\nsymmetry than ionically bonded materials.\nContinuum between Covalent and Ionic Bonds\nCovalent and ionic bonds are end-member models. Transition states exist between them, and few if any\nchemical bonds are perfectly ionic or covalent. The percent ionic character of a bond is a function of the\ndifference between the electronegativities of the elements in the bond, as shown in the following diagram.\nMetallic Bonds\nMetallic Bonding Model\nMinerals like native gold and silver have properties that cannot be explained in terms of ionic or covalent\nbonds. For example, the malleability and electrical conductivity of either metal cannot be readily explained\nby the localized sharing or complete transfer of electrons. Instead, the bonding electrons in native metals\nlike gold and silver are modeled as highly delocalized and free to move from one atom to the next. The\nelectrons compose a mobile electron glue that keeps the positively charged metal ions from flying apart.\nProperties of Metals\nMetals are generally ductile and malleable. They are conductive and not very hard. They are highly\nsymmetric because metallic bonds are nondirectional.\nIntramolecular vs. Intermolecular Bonds\nMetallic, covalent, and ionic bonds are all examples of intramolecular bonds, or bonds between the atoms\nor ions in molecules. Intermolecular bonds are bonds between molecules themselves. These bonds include\ndipole-dipole bonds, van der Waals bonds, and Hydrogen bonds.\n\nDipole-dipole Bonds\n\nWhen the bond between atoms is neither perfectly ionic nor perfectly covalent, shared electrons are located\ncloser to the more electronegative atom. This asymmetric distribution of electrons makes the bond polar\nand the molecule has a dipole moment. In HCl, for example, the more electronegative chlorine atom has a\npartial negative charge (δ-) and the hydrogen atom has a partial positive (δ+) charge.\nThe partially charged ends of such a molecule are attracted to the partially charged ends of other polar\nmolecules. These types bonds are called dipole-dipole bonds.\n\nvan der Waals Bonds\n\nGases such as O2, N2, and the inert gases all have crystalline forms at very low temperatures even though\ntheir molecules are not polar. This results from van der Waals bonds. Van der Waals bonds are\nelectrostatic bonds between atoms or molecules that result from instantaneous asymmetric charge\ndistributions in the atoms and molecules.\nThe asymmetric charge distributions create a temporary dipole moment and the atoms or molecules are\ntemporarily attracted by electrostatic forces.\nVan der Waals bonds are the bonds between layers of carbon atoms in graphite.\n\nHydrogen Bonds\n\nA hydrogen bond is a special type of dipole-dipole bond between a positive hydrogen ion and a negative\nion like O2-. Because the hydrogen ion is an unshielded proton, it can get very close to negative ions or the\nnegative ends of polar molecules and create strong intermolecular bonds. These bonds are considerably\nstronger than van der Waals bonds. The best known example of hydrogen bonds is the attraction between\nhydrogen and oxygen among molecules of water.\nH - Cl\nd+\nd-\nH - Cl\nd+\nd-\nH - Cl\nd+\nd-\nd+\nd+\nd-\nd-\nd+\nd-\n\nClass Handout about Bonding Types\n12.108\nBonding and Physical Properties\nBond Type\nBond Characteristics\nAssociated Physical Properties\nIonic\nAtoms are charged particles.\nHigh symmetry.

Each of these basis units is called a unit cell. The unit cells\nare repeated over and over again in three dimensions to make up a\nmacroscopic crystal.\nThe repeating units can be chosen to have different sizes, but the minimum size\npossible is the primitive unit cell. Larger unit cells are called doubly, triply,\nquardruply primitive.\nIn the case of halite, the primitive cell has sides of 0.564x10-9 m. So, in a 1mm\ncube, there are 8x1018 of the repeated arrangements!\n\nLattice points and vectors:\nEvery point within the primitive unit cell is unique, but within the macroscopic\ncrystal each point is repeated many times.

Choose a point within the repeated unit cell. It can be any point.\nTranslate that point and all the surrounding atoms in the crystal basis by the\nrepeat distance and direction, i.e., the lattice vector. Then the point is repeated,\nas are all the spatial relationships among the surrounding atoms.

Primitive unit cells contain\none lattice point only. The conventional primitive unit cell has the shortest and\nmost nearly equal lattice vectors bounding it.

      "content": "PLANES, FORMS, AND RECIPROCAL LATTICE:\nReading Assignment: Zoltai and Stout, pp. 40-63, Appendix 4.\nPlanes and forms:\nPlanes are natural features associated with the crystalline state. When the\nmacroscopic shape of a crystal is considered the bounding surfaces are\ndisturbances in the bonding of the atoms.\nThey have an associated Gibbs free energy associated with the disturbance\ncaused by having the lattice end.\nThe specific free surface energy is defined as\n0.0\nlim\nγ\n→\n∆\n\ndA\nd G\ndW\ndA\ndA\nFor each mineral, γ is, in general, a function of the orientation of the surface\nnormal with respect to the crystal, of temperature, of pressure, and of the\nchemistry of any pore fluid, gas, or absorbate that is present. The total energy of\nthe finite crystal depends on the sum of the product of γI x total area of the\nsurface i. Values of γ≈1-10 J/m2(0.4- 4.0ev or 1-10 x103 ergs/cm2).\nFree energy is minimized when certain special surfaces occur, for example,\nwhen a crystal is cleaved. In addition, as crystals grow from a solution, the\ngrowth rate of each face is affected by the orientation of its normal, so, special\nplanes also tend to occur during crystal growth, although they may be different\nthan the cleavage planes. The observation of these special surfaces led to the\nhypothesis of elementary building blocks (unit cells) by such early\ncrystallographers as Huygens, Hauy, Hessell, and Bravais (see following page).\nIn addition to the bounding surfaces formed by cleavage or crystal growth, one\nmay consider internal surfaces within the crystal. Such surfaces may be\nimportant when considering mechanical strength, twin structures, grain\nboundaries, antiphase domains, magnetic properties, or x-ray patterns.\n\nNomenclature and Definitions\nPlanes can be described by\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nthe symmetry of the shape of the face, as in cleavage rhombs in\ncalcite.\nthe pole symmetry, e.g., 4mm or 4.\na classical name, pedion, pinacoid, etc.\na letter, e.g., m, r, f, c, e, ...\na set of three indices called Miller indices.\n\nPlanes that intersect along a line common to all are co-zonal. The line along\nwhich they intersect is called a zone axis or more simply, a zone.\n\nCrystal Forms\nThe assemblage of two or more faces/sufaces/planes that are related by\nsymmetry are called forms.\nForms may be open or closed depending on whether or not the surfaces\ncompletely enclose a volume. Forms that are parallel to some symmetry axis\n(that is, the normal is parallel) are called special forms.\nOf course, γ, like every other crystal property is governed by the symmetry of the\ncrystal, thus, planes in the same form have the same specific free energy.\nThere are 150 different names for the forms in thirty two different space groups.\nFor an exhaustive (and exhausting) look at all the forms see [Bloss, 1994,\nChapter 5] and the next two pages .\nSome classical names:\nName\nDescription\nSym.

These three indices are called the Miller indices.\nPlanes that contain more that one lattice point are called rational planes\n\nMiller indices, (h k l), are used to indicate lattice planes. The Miller indices\nare derived from the inverse of the intercept distance of the plane on the\ncrystal axes. The Miller indices are also the coefficients of the equation\nspecifying the position of a general point on the plane.\n\nA recipe for determining the Miller1 indices is\n1.\nFind the intercepts of the plane with the crystallographic axes.\n2.\nTake the reciprocal of each intercept, express the indices as a row or\ncolumn vector.\n3.\nMultiply the reciprocals by the lowest common denominator to get a set\nof three integral indices\nParentheses are used to indicate that the indices represent a plane (rather than a\nlattice vector). Braces are used to indicate a form. Thus, in the isometric system,\nand\n(100)\n(100) are planes within the form {\n}\n100 .\nThe fact that step 2 can be done for all planes of interest is the law of rational\nintercepts, as surmised by Hauy. If just the intercepts are used, then the indices\nare called the Weiss intercepts, a method that is in disfavor.\n\n1 The use of the reciprocal construction and the resulting indices was actually first suggested by\nWilliam Whewell at Cambridge. William Miller succeeded him and popularized their use in a\ncrystallography textbook published in 1839. Zoltai, T., and J.H.

      "content": "Lecture 9: The Earth and What's Inside\nThis lecture discusses the bulk composition of the Earth, its structure, and a few important minerals in the\ncore and crust.\nEarth's Bulk Composition\nScientists estimate the bulk composition of the Earth from meteorites. They assume that certain meteorites\ncalled chondrites have compositions similar to the Earth because both were formed from the same space\ndust, and use the chemical makeup of the meteorites to approximate the composition of the Earth. Their\nwork has shown that the Earth is mostly iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and nickel. They subtract low-T\nvolatile elements in meteorites from the chemical inventory, though, because Earth's proximity to the Sun\nand it's high temperatures during formation have driven these off.\nEarth's Structure\nGeophysical data show that the Earth is divided into a number of sections, as shown in the following\ndiagram.\nThe following table shows what percent of the Earth each part makes up, its mass, and the number of\nminerals it contains.\nPart of Earth\n% of Bulk Earth\nMass (g)\n# of Minerals (phases)\nOcean\n1 x 1021\nContinental Crust\n0.4\n2 x 1025\n> 3000\nOceanic Crust\n0.1\n6 x 1024\n> 3000\nUpper Mantle\n10.3\n6 x 1026\nTransition Zone\n7.5\n4.5 x 1026\nLower Mantle\n49.2\n2.9 x 1027\nOuter Core\n30.8\n1.8 x 1027\nInner Core\n1.7\n1 x 1026\n\nThe Core\nThe core represents 32.5% of the Earth's mass. Scientists believe it is mostly iron-nickel alloy, although\nthey do not know very much about the properties of these metals at the pressures in the core (140 GPa -\n350 GPa). At these pressures, for example, some scientists think that iron melts at 2000 K, and others think\nit melts at 4000 K .\nIn addition to iron and nickel, studies indicate that there is a light element in the core, presumably in the\nmolten part. The identity of the light element is unknown, but oxygen and sulfur are likely candidates.\nSulfur is Professor Groves's favorite candidate.\nBefore Moving to the Mantle: Digression into Sulfur and Sulfides\nSulfides are a class of minerals in which one or two metals are bonded to sulfur. The bonding can be ionic,\ncovalent, or metallic, and as a result sulfides often exhibit a metallic luster even though they are brittle.\nSulfides are economically important because a lot of precious metals are tied up in them, including silver,\nplatinum, and palladium. Below is a list of common sulfides.\nCommon Sulfides\nSphalerite\nZnS\nPyrite\nFeS2\nGalena\nPbS\nChalcopyrite\nCuFeS2\nArsenopyrite\nFeAsS\nMolybdenite\nMoS2\nPentlandite\n(Fe, Ni)9S8\nStibnite\nSb2S3\nSulfides are mostly found in ore deposits in the Earth's crust. These deposits form when hydrothermal\nfluids leach elements that do not fit into the crystal structures of common silicate minerals and deposit them\nin cracks or fractures called veins. Veins can vary in thickness from a fraction of an inch to several\nhundred feet.\nVeins are usually stratified. At the top of a vein, surface fluids dissolve some of the primary (hypogene)\nore minerals and oxidize them, creating a leached zone composed of gossan. Gossan consists of hydrated\niron oxides like limonite and goethite and is the smoking gun prospectors use to find sulfide ore deposits.\nThe soluble elements leached from the surface are redeposited below and form a secondary enrichment\nzone of supergene minerals. This zone is important in mining because metals like copper, gold, and silver\nprecipitate there."

      "content": "Lecture 9: Silicates: Mica and Feldspar\nPhyllosilicates\nJoining two chains of SiO4+ tetrahedra leads to the double chains in amphibole. Adding more chains\nindefinitely leads to sheets of SiO4+ tetrahedra that are the building blocks of phyllosilicates. The other\nbuilding blocks are octahedral sheets.\nThe octahedral sheets may contain divalent or trivalent cations. When the cations are divalent, every cation\nsite is filled and the sheet is called a trioctahedral sheet. When the cations are trivalent, one out of every\nthree cation sites is empty to maintain charge balance and the sheet is called a dioctahedral sheet.\nPhyllosilicates are divided into two major groups based on whether they contain trioctahedral or\ndioctahedral sheets. There is little solid solution between members of the dioctahedral and trioctahedral\ngroups, so their compositions usually are not represented on ternary or quaternary diagrams like pyroxene\nand amphibole.\n\nTrioctahedral phyllosilicates\nLizardite\nMg3Si2O5(OH)4\nTalc\nMg3Si4O10(OH)2\nPhlogopite\nKMg3(AlSi3O10)(OH)2\nClintonite\nCaMg3(Al2Si2O10)(OH)2\n\nDioctahedral phyllosilicates\nKaolinite\nAl2Si2O5(OH)4\nPyrophyllite\nAl2Si4O10(OH)2\nMuscovite\nKAl2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2\nMargarite\nCaAl2(Al2Si2O10)(OH)2\nThe structures of phyllosilicates may be derived by starting with octahedral sheets that contain hydroxyl\ngroups and adding tetrahedral sheets. These octahedral sheets are identical to those in periclase, MgO,\nexcept that the apices of the octahedra are hydroxyl groups instead of oxygen.\n\nCoordinating one tetrahedral sheet to one octahedral sheet results in the structure of lizardite or kaolinite,\ndepending on whether the octahedral sheets are dioctahedral or trioctahedral. Coordinating two tetrahedral\nsheets to one octahedral sheet results in the structures of talc or pyrophyllite, also depending on whether the\noctahedral sheets are dioctahedral or trioctahedral. These layers of coordinated sheets are joined to each\nother by weak van der Waals bonds, producing excellent cleavage and a greasy feel.\n\nK\nK\nBrucite\nAntigorite\nPhlogopite\nDioctahedral\nGibbsite\nKaolinite\nPyrophyllite\nMuscovite\nInterlayer cation\nOxygen\nHydroxyl\nSilicon\nAluminum\nMagnesium\nof\no = octahedral\no\no\no\nt\nt = tetrahedral\no\nt\no\nt\nt\no\nt\nt\no\nt\nt\no\nt\nt\nK\nK\nTrioctahedral\nTalc\n(Adapted from Klein and Hurlbut, Jr. Manual of Mineralogy.

If Al3+ replaces one in every four Si4+, K+ offsets the charge deficit.\nIt occupies 12-coordinated sites between tetrahedral-octahedral-tetrahedral (t-o-t) layers. If Al3+ replaces\nhalf of the Si4+, Ca2+ offsets the charge deficit. In phyllosilicates containing K+ and Ca2+, the t-o-t layers are\nmore firmly held together than those in talc or kaolinite, making minerals like muscovite and phlogopite\nharder and less greasy.\nTectosilicates\nTectosilicates represent over sixty percent of the rocky crust of the Earth. The two most important groups\nare the silica group and feldspar group.\nSilica Group\nSiO2 has eight naturally occurring polymorphs. Of these eight, only low quartz, low tridymite, and low\ncristobalite are common. Stishovite and coesite, the most dense of the polymorphs, have been discovered\nonly in very small amounts and form from the high temperatures and pressures of meteorite impacts.\nFeldspar Group\nFeldspars are the most abundant minerals in the crust. The compositions of most feldspars can be\nrepresented by the ternary system anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8)--albite (NaAlSi3O8)--orthoclase (KAlSi3O8).\nCertain compositions within this system can only be attained at elevated temperatures, and consequently\nthe ternary diagram contains compositional boundaries that move toward the interior with higher\ntemperatures. Feldspars with compositions between anorthite and albite are called plagioclase feldspars.\nThose with compositions between albite and anorthite are called alkali feldspars.\nThe structures of feldspars are based on tetrahedra arranged in four-membered rings that are linked to form\ndouble crankshaft chains. Large metal ions like K+, Na+, or Ca2+ fill available voids. The structure of the\ndouble crankshaft, and consequently mineral symmetry, is controlled by the distribution of aluminum and\nsilicon among the tetrahedra. High temperatures of formation correspond to more disordered and more\nsymmetric feldspars. Lower temperatures of formation cause the Al-Si distribution to be more ordered and\nreduce symmetry.\n\nConsider, for example, the polymorphs of orthoclase and their symmetries. The high temperature\npolymorph, sanidine, has a completely disordered Al-Si distribution and is monoclinic. The low\ntemperature polymorph, microcline, has an ordered Al-Si distribution and is triclinic. This example shows\nhow the structural state of feldspars can be used as indicators of a rock's temperature of formation."

      "content": "Lecture 10: Mantle Minerals\nLower Mantle\nThe lower mantle extends from about 700 km to the core at about 2900 km and represents nearly forty-nine\npercent of Earth's mass. Analysis of seismic waves and stony meteorites indicates that it mostly contains\ncompounds of oxygen with magnesium and silicon, although some iron is also present. Because\nmagnesium is slightly more abundant than silicon in the lower mantle, early researches suggested that it\nwas made up of periclase (MgO) and stishovite (SiO2), the high-pressure form of silica found in meteorite\ncraters.\nStructures of Periclase and Stishovite\nPericlase is an isometric mineral that has a CCP structure just like halite. Magnesium is in six-fold\ncoordination, so that each magnesium atom is surrounded by an octahedron of oxygen atoms. The oxygen\noctahedra share both edges and apices, creating trioctahedral sheets shown below.\nBefore looking at the structure of stishovite, this is a good place to look at a few iron oxides because their\nstructures are based on the structure of periclase. The structure of wustite (FeO), for example, is identical\nto the structure of periclase and contains the same trioctahedral sheets. The structure of hematite (Fe2O3) is\nsimilar to the structure of periclase, but one third of the octahedra are vacancies as shown below. The\nstructure consists of dioctahedral sheets.\n\nLike periclase, wustite, and hematite, stishovite has six-fold coordination in which each atom of silicon is\nsurrounded by six atoms of oxygen. It does not, however, have the same structure. Stishovite is\nisostructural with rutile (TiO2), as shown below.\nNew Ideas about the Lower Mantle\nDuring the late 1980s, new experiments in high-pressure mineralogy suggested that the lower mantle might\nbe a mixture of periclase and MgSiO3. At pressures in the lower mantle, MgSiO3 would have the same\nstructure as perovskite (CaTiO3). Note that although MgSiO3 in the perovskite structure may be the most\nabundant mineral in the planet, it is not yet a mineral because it has never been found!\nPerovskite Structure\nIn perovskite, titanium atoms occupy octahedral sites that only share corners. Large calcium atoms fill the\ntwelve-fold cubo-octahedral void.\nTransition Zone and the Upper Mantle\nThe transition zone and upper mantle contain about eighteen percent of the Earth's mass. Seismology data\nand research of high temperature and pressure minerals indicate that these regions consist mostly of\nMg2SiO4 and MgSiO3 minerals. The dominant mineral has the stoichiometry of Mg2SiO4 and several\npolymorphs. Polymorphs are minerals with the same composition but different structures.\nThe Mg2SiO4 polymorphs include ringwoodite, wadsleyite, and olivine. In each polymorph, silicon is in\ntetrahedral coordination with oxygen and magnesium is in octahedral coordination with oxygen. The\npolymorphs differ in the way these polyhedra are arranged.\n\nThe highest-pressure polymorph of Mg2SiO4 occurs at the base of the transition zone and is called\nringwoodite or γ-MgSiO4. It is isostructural with spinel (MgAl2O4). In the middle of the transition zone at\nabout 520km, ringwoodite changes to wadsleyite or β-MgSiO4. Wadsleyite can hold a lot of water--up to\nabout three percent by weight. If it is saturated, the mantle may hold a volume of water equal to about\ntwenty oceans! The last MgSiO4 polymorph is olivine, occurring at the top of the transition zone. The\nstructure of olivine, in addition to those of ringwoodite and wadsleyite, is difficult to visualize, but 3D\npictures available online help a lot."
