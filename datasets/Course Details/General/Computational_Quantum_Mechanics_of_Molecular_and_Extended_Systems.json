  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nOverview\n\nThe course teaches the art of quantum mechanical calculations from both the chemistry and physics point of view. It, thus, falls somewhere between a laboratory course and a lecture course. In a laboratory course, you must learn by doing, and it is more important that you learn how to run the equipment well and how to interpret the data than that you learn how a piece of equipment is constructed and what exactly is under its cover. Similarly, in this course, you will learn how to run various quantum codes correctly and how to interpret the output of the codes, but you will not necessarily need to know how each algorithm in the 100's of 1000's of lines of code works. On the other hand, you will learn the theories behind the computer codes, so that you will be able to interpret the output of the codes. You will also learn about applications of computational quantum mechanical methods, in order to understand their potential and scope. Finally, you will gain insight into the current research and development of these methods to know where the field is going and what to expect in the future.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nLearn a different approach to solving scientific and engineering problems: performing quantum mechanical calculations and understanding their scope, possibilities and limitations.\n\nBe able to perform calculations during your research at MIT, in\nPractice School\n, and in your future work. (Several students of this class have published papers in major journals based on their projects.)\n\nGain a (partial) familiarity with the literature and be able to read it critically.\n\nUnderstand current research directions and possibilities.\n\nPre-requisites\n\nThere are no specific prerequisites, just permission of the instructor. It is expected that students should be able relatively quickly to become comfortable with advanced concepts from mathematics and physics.\n\nTextbook\n\nSzabo, Attila, and Neil S. Ostlund.\nModern\n\nQuantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory\n. New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1989. ISBN: 9780070627390.\n\nThere is no suitable textbook for this course. The best one still seems to be\nModern Quantum Chemistry\nby Szabo and Ostlund, which is \"required\" for the course.\nIntroduction to Quantum Chemistry\nby Frank Jensen has similar material, but also includes a discussion of density functional theory and has a useful chapter, 12 \"Transition State Theory and Statistical Mechanics.\" It also has helpful descriptions of many of the methods that Gaussian uses. It is \"recommended\" for the course. Finally, see the References document for other helpful books.\n\nSoftware\n\nGaussian03\n: Used to perform quantum mechanical calculations.\n\nGaussView\n: GUI, used to create job files, run jobs, and visualize output.\n\nCPMD\n: Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics Web site.\n\nHardware\n\nSun and Linux(r) machines\n\nNCSA (National Computational Science Alliance): SGI Origin 2000 (796 processors)\n\nHomeworks and Final Project\n\nThere are five problem sets in this course. Each student is required to complete a final project.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nHomework\n\n30%\n\nParticipation\n\n20%\n\nFinal Project\n\n50%",

      "content": "Solution to 10.675 Assignment #1\n1. Derive an expression for the total ground state energy of a two-electron system using\nHartree-Fock theory. This should be done in terms of spin orbitals. Identify the coulomb\nand exchange integrals, and explain their physical significance.\nSolution:\nTwo-electron system is fairly easy to deal with. Since we are doing the general derivation\nfor N-electron system in the next problem, we will omit the repeated work here. Please\nrefer to chapter 2.3.1 in Szabo and Ostlund's Modern Quantum Chemistry (pages 64-66)\nfor the detailed derivation of two-electron system.\n2. Make yourself comfortable with the general derivation of this expression for N\nelectrons.\nSolution:\nFor N-electron system, the Hamiltonian is:\nN\nN\nN\n(\nH = ∑ i\nh ) +\n∑\n∑\nrij\n(1)\ni=1\ni=1\nj>i\nWhere,\ni\nh )\n-\n= 1 ∇i\n2 -∑\nZ A\n(\nA riA\nIn Hartree-Fock theory, we choose the form of the wave function to be that of single\ndeterminant, formed from spin orbitals:\nN !\n|ψ\n>=| χ (1)χ (2) ⋅⋅⋅χ (N ) >= 1 ∑ (-1) Pn P {χ (1)χ (2) ⋅⋅⋅χ (N )}\n(2)\nm\nn\nk\nN! n=1\nn\nm\nn\nk\nwhere Pn is an operator that generates the nth permutation of the electron labels 1, 2, ...N\nand pn is the number of transpositions required to obtain this permutation.\nThe Hartree-Fock ground state energy is:\nN\nN\nN\nE =<\nψ | H\n|ψ >=<\nψ | ∑\n=\n|)\n(\nψ\ni\ni\nh\n<\n+\n>\nψ |\n∑\n∑\n>\n=1\ni\nj\ni\nrij\n|ψ >\n(3)\nSince the electrons in a determinant are indistinguishable, matrix elements of h(1) will be\nidentical to those h(2), h(3), etc. Then we substitute eq. (2) into eq. (3).\nThe first part of eq. (3) becomes:\nN\n<ψ | ∑ i\nh ) |ψ >= N <ψ | h(1) |ψ\n>\n(\ni=1\nN!\n=\n∑∫\ndx\ndx\n2 ⋅⋅⋅ dxN ×P {χ\n*(1)χ (2)* ⋅⋅⋅}h(1)P {χ (1)χ (2) ⋅⋅⋅}\ni\nm\nn\ni\nm\nn\n(N - )!\ni\nN\nN\n= (N - )!\n∑∫ dx1{χ\n*( )}\n1 h(1){χ ( )}\n= ∑< m | h | m >\n(4)\nm\nm\n(N - )!\nm\nm\n\n[Note: The reason that (N-1)! factor was added in the next to the last step is that in the\nsum over the N! permutations, electron 1 will occupy each of the spin orbitals (N-1)!\ntimes. And the integration over the other N-1 electrons will always give a factor of 1\nsince the spin orbitals are normalized.]\nSimilarly, we can get the second part of eq. (3):\nN\nN\n<ψ 0 |\n∑\n∑\nr\nij |ψ 0 >=\n(5)\ni=1\nj>i\nN !\nN !\n(\nPi\nN\nN\n- 1) 1 ∑∑ (-1) (-1)\nPj ∫\ndx\ndx\n2 ⋅⋅⋅ dxN ×P {χ\n*(1)χ (2)* ⋅⋅⋅} 1 Pj {χ (1)χ (2) ⋅⋅⋅}\n!\nN\ni\nj\ni\nm\nn\nm\nn\nr12\nBecause the operator in eq. (5) involves only electrons 1 and 2, it must be that other\nelectrons occupy the same spin orbitals in both the ith and jth permutations, or we could\nget zero by orthogonality upon integrating over the coordinates of these electrons. If\nelectrons 3, 4,...,N occupy the same spin orbitals in the two permutations and electrons 1\nand 2 occupy two spin orbitals, say χk and χl in the permutation Pi, then there are two\npossibilities for electrons 1 and 2 in the permutation Pj: They could either occupy the\nsame spin orbitals χk and χl (same as Pi) or they could occupy χl and χk.\nTherefore, we can write eq. (5) as:\nN!\n∫\n∑\ndx\ndx\n2 ⋅⋅⋅ dxN ×P {χ\n*(1)χ (2)* ⋅⋅⋅} 1 [P {χ (1)χ (2) ⋅⋅⋅} -\nP\nP\n{χ (1)χ (2) ⋅⋅⋅}]\ni\nm\nn\ni\nm\nn\n12 i\nm\nn\n2(N - )!\ni\nr12\nFor a reason similar to that in the first part, in the sum of N! permutations, Pi, electrons 1\nand 2 can occupy any two different spin orbitals χm and χn of the set of N spin orbitals.\nFor each choice of these two spin orbitals there are (N-2)! Ways of permuting the other\nN-2 electrons among the N-2 remaining spin orbitals. Therefore, eq. (5) can be written as:\nN\nN\n<ψ 0 |\n∑\n∑\nr\nij |ψ\n>\ni=1\nj >i\nN\nN\n*\n= (N - )!\n∑\n∑\n∫\ndx\ndx\n2{χ (1)χ (2)*}\n2(N - )!\nm\nn=m\nm\nn\nr12\n(1- P ){χ (1)χ ( )}\nm\nn\nN\nN\n*\n=\n∑\n∑\n∫\ndx\ndx\n2{χ (1)χ (2)*} 1 [{χ (1)χ (\n{\n)}\nχ (2)χ ( )}]\n-\nm\nn\nm\nn\nm\nn=m\nm\nn\nr12\nN\nN\n=\n∑\n∑\n< mn | mn\n<\n-\n>\nmn | nm >\n(6)\nm\nn=m\nCombine eqs. (3) (4) and (6), we get:\nN\nN\nN\nE0 =<ψ 0 | H |ψ >= ∑< m | h | m +\n> 1\n∑\n∑\n< mn | mn\n<\n-\n>\nmn | nm >\nm\n2 m\nn=m\nN\nN\nN\n= ∑< m | h | m +\n>\n∑\n∑\n< mn | mn\n<\n-\n>\nmn | nm >\n(7)\nm\nm\nm>n\n\nFor two-electron system, |ψ\n>=| χ (1)χ (2) > (m=1, n=2 here), eq. 7 becomes:\nN\nN\nN\nE0 = ∑< m | h | m +\n>\n∑\n∑\n< mn | mn\n<\n-\n>\nmn | nm >\nm\nm\nm>n\n=< 1| h |1\n<\n+\n>\n2 | h | 2\n<\n+\n>\n12 |12 > -< 12 | 21 >\n(8)\nwhere <12|12> is the Coulomb integral, which represents the classical Coulomb repulsion\nbetween the charge clouds |ψ1(x1)|2 and |ψ2(x2)|2; <12|21> is the exchange integral. The\nappearance of exchange integrals in the energy of a Slater determinant is a manifestation\nof the fact that the motion of electrons with parallel spins is also correlated."

Unfortunately, if\nwe maintain this balance, this implies that ioniccovalent characteristics should\noccur 50/50. This is obviously not the case. Thus, a fudge factor λ can be used to\nreduce the ionic content of the wave function. Then we can solve variationally.\nTypically, λ is set to 0.26."

With this in mind, our objective is to give you\nsimple, illustrative calculations, and to sacrifice accuracy for speed and simplicity. Additional information\ncan be found at the web site below:\nGeneral Gaussian site:\nhttp://www.gaussian.com/\nAt this site, you can download the Gaussian03 manual or access the Gaussian03 manual on-line. The\nsyntax should not be too much different for Gaussian98 and Gaussian03.\nAlso note that Gaussian's units of energy is the Hartree,\n1 Hartree = 27.21 eV = 627.46 kcal/mol\n1. Run G03W from GaussView\nStart GaussView from the Start menu.\nEither open a previously saved file (.gif or .log) or construct a new molecule structure.\nUnder the Calculate menu, choose Gaussian\nYou now must choose a job type, typically Optimization or Opt+Freq.\nOptimization:\ngeometry optimization of the molecule\nOpt+Freq:\ngeometry optimization and then frequency calculation, including\n\nthermodynamic properties\nNext, you must choose a Method, including Basis Set. The Method is the type of quantum calculation and\ndetermines the accuracy of the calculation.\nThe Basis Set is the mathematical description of the wavefunction that you will calculate. In general, the\nbigger the Basis Set is, the better.\nEach homework set will tell you which Method and which Basis Set to use.\nNote that for methods that are not on the pulldown menu, you can either edit the .gif file (see two lines\ndown) directly, or you can choose \"Hartree-Fock\" and then type in directly the method that you wish to\nuse in the line after \"Additional Keywords:\".\nAfter setting the jobs, choose Submit\nSave the .gif file first (You do not need to add the .gif extension, since that is done automatically.), then the\njob will automatically run.\nThe output file will have the same name as the input file, but with a .log extension.\nThe other important file will be in the Scratch directory. It will have a .chk extension, and will contain all\nimportant information.\n\n2. How to visualize frequencies and non-0 K properties\n1) You need to have performed an Opt+Freq calculation first.\n2) In GaussViewW, go to File-Open and open the .log file. Next go to Results-Vibrations.\n3. How to compute thermodynamic properties of molecules at conditions other than 1 atm and\n298.15 K\n1) You need to have performed an Opt+Freq calculation first.\n2) Move the .chk file into the main G03W directory. (It is likely in the Scratch directory.)\n3) You will now use the freqchk.exe utility.\n4) To do so, you need to first create an input file, called for example in.txt with the following\ncontents:\n<filename>.chk\nn\nTemperature in K\nPressure in atm\ny\n5) Open a DOS prompt and cd to the G03W directory\n6) Use the following command to compute the new thermodynamic data and output it to the file\nout.txt:\nfreqchk.exe < in.txt > out.txt\n4. Performing a transition state calculation\nAs discussed in class, finding a transition state is equivalent to finding a saddle point. A saddle point is a\npoint on the energy hypersurface in which all first derivatives are zero and all second derivative but one are\npositive. The other derivative is negative (single negative eigenvalue).\nWARNING: Gaussian will find the closest saddle point, in other words, the closest point with one negative\nfrequency (second derivative). It may not be the correct transition state. You must visualize the frequency,\nas demonstrated in class, to determine whether this is correct or not. If it is not, you will have to adjust the\ninput reactant and product structures to be closer to the transition state structure that you are trying to find.\n1) Draw the product structure and choose Method and Basis set.\n2) Choose the \"Opt+Freq\" option for Job Type. Also, choose Optimize to a \"TS\" and Calculate\nForce constants \"always\" which means to calculate force constants, at every point. The \"Calculate\nforce constants\" will make the calculation much more expensive, but will give you a much greater\nchance of finding the saddle point. This option makes the program calculate the force constants\n(second derivatives) analytically, as opposed to estimating them. Why does this make such a\ndifference? (Try without this option.) You might also need to add \"noeigentest\" in the\nkeywords for opt to prevent it to stop whenever it finds a negative eigenvalue\neven it has more than one negative eigenvalues.\nA sample file, for the H-HBr reaction is below: (See also the next to the last example at the end of these\nnotes.)\n%mem=6MW\n%nproc=1\n%chk=HHBrReact.chk\n# opt=(CalcAll,ts) freq=noraman ublyp/3-21g\n\nTitle Card Required\n0 2\nBr\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\nH\n0.000000\n0.000000\nZ1\nH\nX1\n0.000000\nZ2\nZ1\n1.410000\nZ2\n1.550000\nX1\n0.000000\n(Don't forget always to leave one blank space at the end.)\n5. Restart a Gaussian job from the checkpoint file.\n(Not necessary for SMA 5413, but OK to do.)\nIn order to save computer time, restarting job from a previous run is possible. For instance, we want to use\nmore accurate methods or larger basis sets to calculate the energy or analyze the frequency from an\noptimized geometry of a previous run. Say, we have a checkpoint file zh1.chk which is the result of a\nzeolite cluster optimization. If we want to use BLYP method and a larger basis set 6-31G* to calculate a\nmore accurate energy of the cluster, a simple restarting input file can be generated like this:\n(single-point calculation, at a fixed geometry)\n%Chk=zh1\n#BLYP/6-31G(d) Guess=Read Geom=Checkpoint\nzeolite energy calculation\n0 1\nSave the file with whatever name you want, i.e. zh1_1.gif, and put the file at the same place as the zh1.chk\nfile. Don't forget to leave a blank space after 0 1 in zh1_1.gif. Since the checkpoint file will be modified\nafter the energy is calculated and the optimiztion is the most time-consuming part, ALWAYS\nREMEMBER TO KEEP A COPY OF CHECKPOINT FILE AFTER THE OPTIMIZATION IS\nFINISHED so that you won't have to rerun it if the checkpoint file is altered.\n(Geometry optimization)\n%Chk=zh1\n#BLYP/6-31G(d) Opt Guess=Read Geom=Checkpoint\nzeolite energy calculation\n0 1\n(Frequency and thermodynamic properties calculation)\nIf you want to do a frequency analysis of the optimized geometry, just add one more keyword to zh1_1.gif\nas below:\n%Chk=zh1\n#BLYP/6-31G(d) Guess=Read Geom=Checkpoint Freq\nzeolite energy calculation\n\n0 1\n(Geometry optimization and frequency calculation w/thermodynamic properties)\n%Chk=zh1\n#BLYP/6-31G(d) Opt Guess=Read Geom=Checkpoint Freq\nzeolite energy calculation\n0 1\n(Transition state calculation)\n%Chk=zh1\n#BLYP/6-31G(d)\nOpt=(CalcFC,TS,NoEigentest,MaxCycle=300)\nGuess=Read\nGeom=Checkpoint Freq\nzeolite transition state calculation\n0 1\n6.
