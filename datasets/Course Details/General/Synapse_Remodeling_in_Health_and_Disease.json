  "course_description": "Our brains are remarkably adaptable throughout our lives. Individual brain cells called neurons form synapses, sites of physical connection and communication between neurons, and then repeatedly rewire those connections in response to new experiences or to neuronal cell death caused by injury, disease, or aging. In this course, we will explore how neurons establish their synapses in the healthy brain during childhood and later in life, and how this process goes awry in disease states. More specifically, we will discuss how the brain forms its synapses early in life, stabilizes a subset of those synapses for long-term maintenance, and continues to add and remove synapses throughout life. We will then explore synapse dysfunction in diseases such as autism and Alzheimerâ€™s disease, which involve abnormal increases or losses of synaptic connections, respectively. We will also consider synapse remodeling, a process of adding and removing synaptic connections to optimize our brain network, in the context of neuroinflammation, recovery from traumatic brain injury, and psychological trauma following prolonged stress.\nThis course is one of many Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong interest in teaching.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere is no strict prerequisite for this course, but some knowledge of molecular biology and/or neuroscience is recommended. We expect that all students will encounter some unfamiliar terminology while reading research papers from the primary literature, regardless of their academic background. We will go over important terminology in class, but students should also be prepared to do their own internet searches for unfamiliar terminology and/or bring their questions to the next class session.\n\nCourse Description\n\nOur brains are remarkably adaptable throughout our lives. Individual brain cells called neurons form synapses, sites of physical connection and communication between neurons, and then repeatedly rewire those connections in response to new experiences or to neuronal cell death caused by injury, disease, or aging. In this course, we will explore how neurons establish their synapses in the healthy brain during childhood and later in life, and how this process goes awry in disease states.\n\nMore specifically, we will discuss how the brain forms its synapses early in life, stabilizes a subset of those synapses for long-term maintenance, and continues to add and remove synapses throughout life. We will then explore synapse dysfunction in diseases such as autism and Alzheimer's disease, which involve abnormal increases or losses of synaptic connections, respectively. We will also consider synapse remodeling, a process of adding and removing synaptic connections to optimize our brain network, in the context of neuroinflammation, recovery from traumatic brain injury, and psychological trauma following prolonged stress.\n\nThis course will be discussion-based. Each session will provide an opportunity for students to tackle two related papers from the primary scientific literature, ask questions to hone their understanding of the methodology and data presented in the papers, and practice critiquing the papers. Students will also have an opportunity to build their written and verbal communication skills through a written assignment and an oral presentation. The written assignment will focus on proposing an experiment in a mock mini-grant proposal, which students will draft and then refine together during one of the class sessions. In the oral presentation, students will practice explaining and critiquing a paper from the scientific literature.\n\nTo provide real-life experience with the techniques used in the papers we discuss in class, we will see a demonstration of brain imaging in an MIT neuroscience laboratory, which will exemplify the experimental methods needed to generate the scientific figures analyzed in class. To facilitate discussion about career paths in the biomedical sciences, we will go on a field trip to an industry laboratory, where we will hear from industry scientists about their career journeys and learn about ongoing research behind neuromuscular diseases, a family of rare genetic disorders characterized by muscle degeneration due to alterations in the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThis course will introduce students to a variety of methodologies used not only in the field of synapse dynamics but more generally across many disciplines in the field of molecular medicine. This class may be particularly beneficial to students interested in careers in biomedical research and/or medicine, but we welcome all students who are excited about learning how to read the primary scientific literature, understanding the process of critical scientific reasoning, and learning about how our brains remodel their connections in healthy and diseased states.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThis course is discussion-based and will meet once per week for two hours. Each week, we will focus on two papers from the primary literature. Students are expected to read both papers carefully, bring their thoughts/questions to class and/or send them by e-mail to the instructors before class, and be prepared to participate actively in the discussion. At the end of each class, the instructors will provide a brief introduction to the papers that will be discussed in the next class session, to provide context for the papers and go over any important new experimental methods and terminology.\n\nWe will spend one class session on a field trip to Vertex Pharmaceuticals, half a class session on an imaging demonstration in the neurobiology laboratory of MIT Professor Elly Nedivi, one class session workshopping students' mock grant proposals, and one class session on students' final oral presentations (see\nAssignments\nfor details).\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nThe major goal is to learn to read and critique the primary research literature. By the end of the course, students should be able to do the following:\n\nIdentify the central questions in a paper from the primary literature.\n\nIdentify the experiment(s) and key control(s) that were performed to answer that question.\n\nIdentify the authors' conclusions and the data that support each conclusion.\n\nEvaluate whether each conclusion is well supported by the data presented in the paper.\n\nFor any claims that are not well supported, propose experiments the authors could perform to clarify the ambiguity.\n\nPropose new experiments that could further test or extend the findings of the paper.\n\nMore specifically, through our discussions and the written assignment, students will become more familiar with basic principles of experimental design, learning to understand the use and design of control experiments and to design new experiments with appropriate controls.\n\nThe papers we read each week will focus on a topic specified in the syllabus for that specific week. By the end of the course, we hope students also will learn about aspects of the field of neurobiology, will develop a broad familiarity with how synapses remodel during the course of normal development and in the context of various diseases, and will understand the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques and experimental systems that are used to investigate synapse remodeling.\n\nGrading and Attendance Policies\n\nThis course is worth 6 units and is graded pass/fail. A student who attends the course, actively participates in discussions, and completes both written and oral assignments in a satisfactory manner will receive a passing grade.\n\nField Trip and Imaging Technique Demonstration\n\nIn the Boston area, we are surrounded by labs that are at the forefront of biology and neuroscience research in both academia and industry. We will spend one class session on a field trip to\nVertex Pharmaceuticals\n, where we will hear from scientists about their career journeys and learn about their ongoing research. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene delivery system has revolutionized approaches to gene therapy and opened the door to personalized medicine. During our visit to Vertex Pharmaceuticals, we will learn about CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to treat neuromuscular disorders and cystic fibrosis. This experience will introduce students to a variety of methodologies used not only in the field of synapse dynamics but more generally across many disciplines in the field of molecular medicine.\n\nTo provide real-life exposure to some of the techniques used in the papers we discuss in class, students will observe a demonstration of\nin vivo\n2-photon imaging of the mouse brain to view how synapses on the dendritic arbor of a single neuron behaves in the brain of a live mouse. This visit to the MIT neuroscience laboratory of Professor Elly Nedivi will exemplify experimental methods used to generate some of the scientific figures discussed in class prior to the demonstration. More specifically, students will observe how the genetic labeling of individual neurons and their synapses allows studies of how synaptic connections are made and removed in real-time. Students also will observe how specific gene targets are validated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which amplifies the DNA sequence of a gene and can be used to determine the presence/absence of a specific fragment belonging to the gene of interest. Both techniques are applied broadly in the field of neurobiology.\n\nClassroom Culture\n\nAll members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for all other members of the class. We welcome students of all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious and political affiliations--and other visible and non-visible differences. We (the instructors, Joe and Dalila) will provide a link to a feedback platform where students can send us any concerns about the class environment, our teaching, or their interactions with other students in the class. We will also provide feedback forms specifically about our teaching midway through the semester and at the end of the semester.\n\nCalendar\n\nWeek\n\nTopics\n\nIntroduction\n\nSynapse Plasticity: Developing Brain\n\nSynapse Plasticity: Aging Brain\n\nSensory Experience-Dependent Plasticity--Part 1\n\nSensory Experience-Dependent Plasticity--Part 2\n\nLearning-Induced Synaptic Plasticity\n\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders: Autism and Fragile X Syndrome\n\nWorkshop Mock Grant Proposals\n\nRough draft of mock grant proposal due\n\nNeurodegeneration: Alzheimer's Disease\n\nFinal draft of mock grant proposal due\n\nInjury: Peripheral Nerve Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury\n\nField Trip to\nVertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nFear and Trauma\n\nDeadline to choose paper for final presentation\n\nNedivi Lab Visit: Technique Demonstrations\n\nFinal Oral Presentations and Wrap-up Discussion",

      "content": "Reading Questions for Week 12:\n- Lai et al. (2018) and Colyn et al. (2019) use two different models of trauma: fear\nconditioning and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), respectively. Please briefly discuss\nthe advantages and disadvantages of each model, e.g. which types of human trauma\nwould be more appropriately represented by fear conditioning vs CSDS?\nQuestion for Colyn et al., 2019\n1. In Colyn et al., do you find it surprising that the effects of CSDS are delayed and/or long-\nlasting? Do you think it is adaptive or maladaptive for animals to have such long-lasting\nchanges in their brains after CSDS, i.e. is this a healthy response to danger or a\npathological phenotype?\n2. In Colyn et al., is there any mention of blinding to treatment condition during image\nacquisition and/or analysis?\n3. In Colyn et al., what was the control group used for comparison to mice experiencing\nCSDS? Do you think this was an appropriate control?\nQuestion for Lai et al., 2018\n1. The authors claim that fear conditioning elicit formation of different new spines with\ndifferent auditory cues. What is the evidence they provide? Do you agree? If so, what do\nyou think is driving these changes in response?\n2. In figure 3 and 4, the data suggests that fear-extinction preferentially eliminates newly\nformed spines induced by fear conditioning and this elimination is cue specific. Does the\ndata strongly support this conclusion? What could be driving the structural changes to\nfavor elimination? How is this conclusion similar or different to structural changes\ninduced by learning-based paradigms?\n3. If fear extinction reverses new spines induced by fear conditioning in a location-and cue-\nspecific manner in the mouse auditory cortex, do you think we could use learned-based\nconditioning to treat stress or PSTD? If so, how would you attempt to test this idea in\nmice?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n7.342 Synapse Remodeling in Health and Disease\nFall 2022\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Why do you think the authors chose these particular brain regions (PFC, OFC, and BLA) for their\nstudy of adolescent brain maturation?\n2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using fixed tissue from animals that were\neuthanized at specific ages (e.g. Counotte et al., 2010) vs live animals for synapse imaging\nstudies (e.g. Johnson et al., 2016)?\n3. Could Johnson et al. have drawn the same conclusions if they had used fixed tissue?\n4. In Johnson et al., the authors concluded that the density of dendritic spines in dmPFC decreases\nwith age, the density of BLA-dmPFC boutons increases with age, and the density of\nOFC-dmPFC boutons does not change with age.

Based on Fig. 5f (in Johnson et al.), are BLA axons growing, shrinking, or showing no net change\nin juvenile mice? In adult mice, are the BLA axons growing, shrinking, or showing no net change?\n7. In Counotte et al., describe the control group(s) for Fig. 1. If none, justify your answer.\n8. In Counotte et al., the authors claimed that nearly 35% of the identified synaptic proteins\nundergo significant changes in expression. Do you agree with the statement?

Recent evidence has shown that adult\nneurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is not merely a remnant of development, but a tightly regulated\nprocess that equips mammals with the ability to adapt to various environmental changes4,5. In the\ndentate gyrus of the hippocampus, an area involved in memory formation, newborn neurons\ndifferentiate into dentate granule cells (DGCs)1,5. About 50% of new DGCs successfully\nintegrate into hippocampal circuits, a process enhanced by environmental enrichment, stress and\nthe completion of tasks that require learning. Enriched environments are frequently employed in\nstudies of adult-born DGC survival because the large number of novel environmental encounters\nprovides a simple means to encourage learning and subsequently elevates neuronal firing of\nnewborn cells. Neuronal activity and synaptogenesis are important in determining which cells\nsurvive5. Adult-born DGCs possess elevated intrinsic excitability and plasticity, and neuronal\nactivity and synaptogenesis are important determinants of which cells survive5.3 . For\nsynaptogenesis to ensue, all the following events need to occur: formation of dendritic spines,\nglutamate input coming from the entorhinal cortex and the formation of axonal projections3,4.\nNewborn DGCs receive excitatory glutamate signaling predominantly via the N-methyl-D\naspartate receptors (NMDARs) from the enthorinal cortex, an area responsible for encoding\nfamiliarity, and they send excitatory glutamate signaling to the CA3 region, an area responsible\nfor memory consolidation. Given these findings, it is important to understand the role of enriched\nenvironments in elevated neuronal activity and thereby in DGC survival5. Hypothesis: Since\nenriched environmental exposure increases neuronal firing in adult-born DGCs, I hypothesize\nthat this elevated neuronal firing increases the likelihood of synaptogenesis, and hence survival.\nTo determine if DGC survival is dependent on increased excitability, I will use a modified teg-\ntag transgenic mouse line that allows persistent labeling of newborn neurons, and I will track\nsuch neurons until a successful synaptic connection is made by implanting a cranial glass\nwindow for two-photon in vivo imaging2,7.\nSuch\ntechnique\nhas\nalready\nallowed\nscientists to obtain long-term in vivo\nimaging of dendritic spines in the CA1\nhippocampal\nregion2,7.\nIf\nenvironment-\nFigure 1: Modified Teg-tag transgenic mouse system.\ndependent\nneuronal\nactivity\nincreases\nDeng et al., eLIFE, 2, (2013). License CC-BY.\nneuronal survival, I will go on to study if the glutamate pathway plays a role in neuronal survival\nby blocking NMDARs in newborn DGCs.\nExperimental Design:\nAim 1: Determine if DGC survival and hippocampal integration is dependent on increased\nneuronal excitability elicited by environmental factors: To label activated newborn neurons\nduring an environmental exposure, I will use the doxycycline-dependent (dox) teg-tag transgenic\nmouse that I optimized during my internship at UCSD (Fig. 1). In these mice, neuronal firing\nactivates the Fos promoter and induces the expression of tetracycline-controlled transactivator\n(tTA), which activates the expression of the tau-LacZ/YFP tag.6. The presence of a mutated tTA\n(tTA*) will allow persistent tau-LacZ expression in neurons irrespective of dox treatment6.\nAnimals will receive bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a proliferation marker, at the beginning of the\nexperiment to label all the neurons that were born during that period. The enriched environment\nwill include a running wheel, colorful house nest and toys. A chronic cranial glass window will\n\nResearch Proposal:\nDalila Ordonez\nbe implanted into the mouse brain before environmental exposure for in vivo two-photon\nimaging2. The two-photon microscope offers long-term in vivo imaging in awake animals owing\nto the head plate that provides specific coordinates to continuously reimage the same neurons\nover time. Using the transgenic mouse model, I will label only the newborn neurons that were\nactivated during the enriched environment exposure and follow them with two-photon imaging\nuntil they make a successful synaptic connection. The formation of synaptic connections will be\ntracked daily using real-time imaging. The formation of a synaptic connection with a CA3 region\nneuron indicates that the neuron has integrated into the hippocampal circuitry. In addition,\ncontrol experiments will be conducted with no exposure to an enriched environment. Since\nproper synaptic connections is required for neuronal survival, with these experiments, I expect to\nestimate the proportion of surviving neurons among those activated during environmental\nexposure. If the enriched environment is influencing the survival of newborn neurons, the\nnumber of successful synaptic connections of activated neurons should be higher in the enriched-\nenvironment group than in the control group. Such results will suggest that elevated neuronal\nfiring during exposure to the enriched environment improved newborn neuron survival. If the\nresults are very similar to control animals, this will suggest that environmental exposure during\ndevelopment increases neuronal activity of newborn neurons1 but that it is not sufficient to\nensure their survival.\nAim 2: Determine if neuronal survival is regulated by glutamate signaling between the\nentorhinal cortex-DG-CA3 region: NMDARs are predominantly responsible for the glutamate\nexcitatory signaling that newborn neurons receive from the entorhinal cortex during their\ndevelopment. Therefore, blocking NMDARs in the DGCs will impair the signaling input they\nreceive. Carboxyethylester (CGP 39551), a high-affinity NMDAR antagonist, will be\nadministered intraperitonially (ip) to block NMDARs. By blocking the glutamate pathway, I will\nbe able to determine the role of glutamate signaling in the survival of newborn neurons. I will\nuse the same experimental setup described in Aim 1. Two control groups will be included to\ndifferentiate between the effects of the enriched environment plus NMDAR blockage and the\neffects of NMDAR blockage alone. I expect to obtain an estimate of the number of neurons that\nwere activated and survived in the presence of the NMDAR antagonist. Such results will be\ncompared to the number of neurons that were activated and survive in the absence of the\nNDMAR antagonist. If antagonist treatment decreases the number of activated neurons that\nmade a successful synaptic connection and survived, it will suggest that enriched environmental\nexposure increases glutamatergic signaling, providing the newborn neurons with sufficient\nsignaling input to ensure the formation of a proper synaptic connection. If the number of\nantagonist-treated neurons making proper synaptic connections is higher than or equal to that in\ncontrol groups, I would conclude that environmental effects are not exerted via the glutamate\npathway. If the glutamate pathway does not have an effect on neuronal survival, I will examine\nthe GABAergic signaling pathway, which is predominantly activated during early development\nof newborn neurons.\nBroader impacts: An understanding of the formation of synaptic connections and neuronal\nsurvival in the adult brain will shed light on the putative function of adult neurogenesis in\nhippocampal information processing and storage. In addition, these studies will provide us with a\nnew method that can be use to modulate adult neurogenesis. Also, working with undergraduates\nin this project will allow me to continue mentoring and training young scientists.\nReferences: 1Deng et al., eLIFE, 2, (2013). 2 Gu et al. J.
