It shows the utility of abstract concepts through a study of real numbers, and teaches an understanding and construction of proofs.\n\nTextbook\n\nLebl, Jiri.\nBasic Analysis I: Introduction to Real Analysis, Volume 1\n. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2018. ISBN: 9781718862401.\n\nThis book is available as\na free PDF download\n. You can purchase a paper copy by following a link at the same site.\n\nHomework and Exams\n\nThe written homework is extremely important (mathematics is not a spectator sport). The best way to test your knowledge of a concept is to try and use it; this is why you work problems. Collaboration with other students in the class is encouraged, but separate solutions must be written up and collaborators documented at the top right-hand corner of all submitted work. In general, late homework will not be accepted. However, circumstances may arise that warrant an extension; such an extension request should be emailed to the instructor. The lowest individual homework grade will be dropped when computing the final homework grade for the course.\n\nThe midterm exam is a 24-hour take-home exam.\n\nGrading\n\nAssignments 1-12 account for 50% of the course grade, the midterm accounts for 25% of the course grade, and the Final Assignment accounts for the remaining 25% of the course grade.\n\nSchedule Note\n\nThis class took place during the COVID-19 pandemic while students were not on campus. Prerecorded lectures for each week were posted on the class website each Monday. Recitations and Office Hours were conducted online.",

      "content": "Final Exam Review\nTo-do list:\n1. First we will cover continuity and uniform continuity,\n2. Then we will derivatives, and how to use the definition of a derivative to calculate it.\n3. Finally we will discuss pointwise and uniform convergence, and how to prove these.\nNote that these aren't all of the topics that may be on the exam. The following will not be covered during this\nrecitation, but may show up:\n- Materials from the first half of the class (covered during the Midterm Exam Review).\n- The Mean Value Theorem, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and the Intermediate Value Theorem\n- L'Hospital's Rule.\nContinuity and Uniform Continuity\nLets start with the definitions. Let f : S → R. Then,\n- f is continuous at the point x0 ∈ S if ∀ε > 0, ∃δ such that |f(x) - f(x0)| < ε for |x - x0| < δ.\n- f is a continuous function if it is continuous for every x ∈ S. This is the definition of pointwise continuity.\nNote that with pointwise continuity, δ *can depend* on x0.\n- f is uniformly continuous on S if ∀ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that ∀x0 ∈ S, |f(x) - f(x0)| < ε when |x - x0| <\nδ. The di erence between this and the definition of pointwise continuity is where the x0 is in the mathematical\nstatement- since the \"∀x0 \" occurs after the \"δ\", this means δ cannot depend on x0.\nAn example of a non-uniformly continuous function is f(x) = x , as given ε > 0, δ depends on x. We can see\nthis pictorally, but will not prove it rigorously here.\nProblem 10\nShow that the function f(x) =\nis a uniformly continuous function on R (i.e. S = R).\nx2+1\n\nProof: We want to show that ∀ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that ∀x0 ∈ S, |f(x) -f(x0)| < ε when |x -x0| < δ.\nThus, consider the following:\n|x0 + 1 - x2 - 1\n-\n=\nx2 + 1\nx + 1\n|x2 + 1| · |x + 1|\n|x0 - x| · |x0 + x|\n=\n.\n(x2 + 1)(x + 1)\nNow we have an |x - x0| in the numerator, which is useful for us to use δs and εs for. Now note that\n|x0 + x|\n→ 0\n(x2 + 1)(x + 1)\nas x → ±inf. Furthermore, the function is continuous as a function of x and is thus bounded. Hence, ∃B such that\n|x + x0|\n< B\n(x2 + 1)(x + 1)\nε\nfor all x and x0. Thus, let δ =\n(notably, δ is independent of x0). Therefore, ∀ε > 0,\nB\n|x0 + 1 - x2 - 1\n-\n=\nx2 + 1\nx + 1\n|x2 + 1| · |x + 1|\n|x0 - x| · |x0 + x|\n=\n(x2 + 1)(x + 1)\n≤ B|x0 - x|\n< Bδ\n= ε.\nHence, f is uniformly continuous.\nDerivatives\nWe will first use an example to show how we can calculate a derivative strictly using the definition.\nProblem 11\nLet\n⎧√\n⎨ x2 + 1,\nx ≥ 0\nf(x) =\n.\n⎩x2 + 1,\nx < 0\nCompute f 0 , and prove whether or not f 00 is defined on all of R.\nProof: To calculate f 0 , we first calculate f 0 for x > 0 and x < 0 using standard calculus: For x > 0\n2x\nf 0(x) = √\n2 x2 + 1\nx\n= √\n.\nx2 + 1\nFor x < 0,\nf 0(x) = 2x.\nThis is not meant to be the diycult analysis part of the problem- what makes it more tricky is finding the derivative\n\nat x0 = x. To do this, we want to find\nf(x) - f(0)\nf(x) - 1\nlim\n= lim\n.\nx→0\nx - 0\nx→0\nx\nTo do so, we find the left and right sided limits and show they are equal.\n√\nf(x) - 1\nx2 + 1 - 1\nlim\n= lim\nx→0+\nx\nx→0+\nx\n√\n√\nx2 + 1 - 1\nx2 + 1 + 1\n= lim\n· √\nx→0+\nx\nx2 + 1 + 1\nx\n= lim\n√\nx→0+ x ·\nx2 + 1 + 1\n= 0.\nf(x) - 1\nx2 + 1 - 1\nlim\n= lim\nx→0-\nx\nx→0+\nx\n= 0.\nTherefore, f is di erentiable at 0 and f 0(0) = 0. Thus we can say\n⎧\n⎨\nx\n√\n,\nx ≥ 0\nf 0(x) =\nx2+1\n.\n⎩2x,\nx < 0\nNow we want to see whether or not f 00 is defined on all of R, and to start we once again calculate f 00 for x > 0,\nx < 0, and see what happens at 0. For x > 0, by the quotient rule,\n√\n√ x\nx2 + 1 -\nf 00(x) =\nx2+1\nx2 + 1\nx2 + 1 - x2\n=\n(x2 + 1)\n=\n.\n(x2 + 1)\nFor x < 0,\nf 00(x) = 2.\nHowever, note that\nf 00(x)\nf 00(x) = 2,\n1 = lim\n6= lim\nx→0+\nx→0-\nand thus f 00(x) is not defined at x = 0.\nProblem 12\nCalculate\nd Z\nx\nsin(t2) dt.\ndx\nProof: Given the structure of this problem, it should be clear that we want to use the Fundamental Theorem\nof Calculus, but we have to be careful with that x . Firstly, we will restate the Fundamental Theorem. Let\nF 0(x) = f(x). Then,\nZ x\nf(t) dt = F (x) - F (0),\n\nand thus\nZ x\nd\nd\nf(t) dt =\n(F (x) - F (0)) = f(x).\ndx\ndx\nIt will be helpful in this problem (and in general on exams!) to go a bit slowly. Let F 0(x) = sin(x2). Therefore,\nZ\nx\nd\nsin(t2) dt = d (F (x 2) - F (0))\ndx\ndx\n= d F (x 2).\ndx\nUsing the chain rule and the fact that F 0(x) = sin(x2), we have\n= 2x · F 0(x 2)\n= 2x sin(x 4).\nPointwise vs Uniform Convergence\nFirstly, we define both. Let fn : S → R be a sequence of functions.\n- We say that fn converges to f pointwise if for all x ∈ S,\nlim fn(x) = f(x).\nn→inf\n- We say that fn → f uniformly if ∀ε > 0, ∃N such that\nsup |fn(x) - f(x)| < ε\nx\nfor all n > N. Notice that this is true if and only if\n|fn(x) - f(x)| < ε\nfor all n > N and ∀x ∈ S. This statement may feel trivial, but allows us another way to prove uniform\nconvergence.\nLets discuss both separately.\n⎧\n⎨\n⎩\nExample 13\nn\nConsider the sequence of functions fn(x) = x for x ∈ [0, 1]. Show that fn → f pointwise where\n0,\nx =6\nf(x)\n.\n1,\nx = 1\nn\nProof: Pick x0 ∈ [0, 1] and let an = fn(x0) = x0 . Then,\n⎧\n⎨\n⎩\n0,\nx =6\n1,\nx = 1\n.\nn\nlim an = lim x =\nn→inf\nn→inf\nExample 14\nx\nConsider the sequence of functions fn(x) =\nfor x ∈ R. Show that fn → f pointwise f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R.\nn\n\nx0\nProof: Pick x0 ∈ R and let an = fn(x0) =\n. Then,\nn\nx0\nlim an = lim\n= 0.\nn→inf\nn→inf n\nExample 15\nnx+1\nConsider the sequence of functions fn(x) =\nfor x ∈ R. Show that fn → f uniformly where\nn(x2+1)\nx\nf(x) =\n.\nx2 + 1\nProof: Well, firstly note that\nx\nfn(x) =\n+\n= f(x) +\n.\nx2 + 1\nn(x2 + 1)\nn(x2 + 1)\nFurthermore, we want to show that for all ε > 0, there exists an N such that\n|fn(x) - f(x)| < ε\nfor all n > N and x ∈ R. Let N be the smallest natural number such that\n< ε (we can similar have let N = d 1 e).\nN\nε\nThen,\n|fn(x) - f(x)| =\n≤\n<\n< ε\nn(x2 + 1)\nn\nN\nfor all n > N.\nTo finish o this review, lets consider the similarities and di erences of uniform continuity and convergence.\nUniform Continuity\nUniform Convergence\n- Deals with a single function\n- Deals with a sequence of functions\n- It is continuous and \"the same δ\" works for all points - \"The same N\" works for every point\n- These functions have a limit (namely another function)\nProblem 16\nLet f : R → R be a uniformly continuous function, and let\nn Z\nx+ n\nfn(x) = 2\nx- 1 f(t) dt.\nn\nShow that fn → f uniformly.\nProof: One useful way to start approaching problems like this is to figure out where certain terms/coeycients\nn\ncome from. For instance, why do we have a ? Well, we can notice that\nZ\nR 1+ 1\nR x- 1\nx+\nn\nn\nn\nn\nf(t) dt -\nf(t) dt\nf(t) dt =\n.\nx- 1\nx +\n- (x - 1 )\nn\nn\nn\n\nLet F 0(x) = f(x), and thus by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we have that\nZ 1+ 1\nR x+ n\nR x- n\nn\nn\nf(t) dt -\nf(t) dt\nf(t) dt =\nx- 1\nx +\n- (x - 1 )\nn\nn\nn\nF (x +\n) - F (0) - (F (x - 1 ) - F (0))\nn\nn\n=\nx +\n- (x - 1 )\nn\nn\nF (x +\n) - F (x - 1 )\nn\nn\n=\n.\nx +\n- (x - 1 )\nn\nn\nNow we want to relate this back to f, and we can notice that what we have so far is in the form of the mean value\ntheorem, which states that ∃x0 ∈ (x - 1 , x +\n) such that\nn\nn\nF (x +\n) - F (x - 1 )\nn\nn = F 0(x0) = f(x0).\nx +\n- (x - 1 )\nn\nn\nTherefore, for some x0 ∈ (x - 1 , x +\n), fn(x) = f(x0). Hence, |fn(x) - f(x)| = |f(x0) - f(x)|. Since f is uniformly\nn\nn\ncontinuous, for all ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that |f(x) - f(x0)| < ε when |x - x0| < δ. Let δ =\n.\nN\nTherefore, fn → f uniformly.\nBest of luck on your exam!\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100A / 18.1001 Real Analysis\nFall 2020\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Midterm Exam Review\nTo-do list:\n1. First we will cover general exam review tips.\n2. Then we will discuss definitions, theorems, and problems, including\n- Suprema/infina\n- Limits\n- lim inf/lim sup and Cauchy sequences\n- Series and series tests.\nThe first exam tip is to look back at definitions we have covered so far (there are a lot!). Try to interpret them\nintuitively, and if possible try to draw pictures. Think about why these definitions are useful, and in particular see\nhow they were useful in homework problems.\nNow we move onto some definitions and remarks about them.\nSuprema and Infima\np is the supremum of a set S if it is the least upper bound. Recall that p is an upper bound for S if p ≥ x for all x ∈\nS. If p is the supremum of S and p0 is an upper bound for S, then p ≤ p . There are a few very properties and remarks\nwe would like to cover here regarding suprema:\n- p is the supremum of a set S if ∀ε > 0 there exists an x ∈ S such that p - ε < x ≤ p. (How can you prove\nthis/think about this intuitively?)\n- Finite sets always contain their supremum, and in fact sup S = max S where S is a finite set. One example\nof an infinite set that does not contain the supremum is (0, 1), which has supremum 1 but has no maximum.\nThere are a few algebraic operations we can consider:\n- sup(λS) = λ sup S if λ ≥ 0.\n- sup(A + B) = sup A + sup B if sup A and sup B exist. This was a problem in the homework.\n- If A, B ⊂ R>0 then sup(AB) = sup A · sup B (which we covered in Recitation 01).\nProblem 6\nLet X be a closed and bounded set. Show that X contains its supremum.\nTry to solve this problem before you read the solution!\nProof:\nWe are given that X is closed and bounded, but what does this actually tell us?\n1. X is closed ⇐⇒ Xc is open ⇐⇒ ∀x ∈ Xc there exists an ε > 0 such that (x - ε, x + ε) ⊂ Xc .\n2. X is bounded, which implies that X has a supremum. Let sup X = p.\nMost of the time, simply writing out/knowing these definitions is half of the battle. Now we will show that p ∈ X\nby contradiction.\nSuppose that p ∈/ X. Then, p ∈ Xc , which we know to be open by 1.. Therefore, there exists an ε > 0 such\nthat (p - ε, p + ε) ⊂ Xc . This implies that there does not exist any x ∈ X such that p - ε < x < p. Therefore,\n\np - ε is an upper bound for X. However, p - ε < p =⇒ p 6= sup X then p is not a least upper bound. This is a\ncontradiction, and thus p ∈ X.\nOne more remark regarding lim sup. Firstly, the definition: lim sup xn = lim supm≥n{xm}. Now: is it the case\nthat the lim sup is always in the sequence? No. Consider the sequence xn = 1 - 1 . Then, lim sup xn = 1 /\n}.\n∈{xn\nn\nLimits\nLet xn be a sequence (n ∈ N). Then, limn→inf xn = x (i.e. xn converges to x) if ∀ε > 0, ∃N > 0 such that for\nall n > N |xn - x| < ε.\nWhen we are given a problem along the lines of \"show that xn converges\", this requires that we know what the\nlimit is. But once we know/are given what the sequence will converge to, there are a few ways to prove convergence:\n- Using the definition of a limit directly.\n- The squeeze theorem.\nRecall that the squeeze theorem states that if given three sequences xn, yn, zn such that xn ≤ yn ≤ zn for all n ∈ N\nand\nlim xn = lim zn = L,\nn→inf\nn→inf\nthen limn→inf yn = L. The squeeze theorem is particularly useful if yn has a complicated or unknown formula.\nGoing back to our list, of ways to show a sequence converges:\n- lim sup xn = lim inf xn will show that the sequence converges.\nIn particular, proving the contrapositive can be useful for showing a sequence does not converge.\n- Showing that xn is a Cauchy sequence.\nThis is particularly useful if you do not know what the limit of the sequence is. Recall that a sequence if a Cauchy\nsequence if ∀ε > 0 there exists an N such that |xn - xm| < ε for all m, n > M.\nProblem 7\nGiven that xn → 5 and xn =6\n0 for all n, show that\n→\nxn\nusing the definition of the limit.\nProof: Where else to begin than with what we are given. We know that xn → 5, and thus for all ε > 0 there\nexists an N such that |xn - 5| < ε for all n > M. Furthermore, we want to show that ∀ε0 > 0, ∃N 0 such that\n-\n< ε0 .\nxn\nTo relate these two pieces of information, we can try to make the term |xn - 5| \"appear\" in the above inequality:\n|5 - xn|\n|xn - 5|\n-\n=\n=\n.\nxn\n|5xn|\n|5xn|\nThis would be really helpful if we can get rid of the xn in the denominator, and to do this we can utilize the fact\nthat xn → 5. Given xn → 5, there exists an N1 such that for all n > N1, |xn - 5| < 1 =⇒ 4 ≤ xn ≤ 6 for all\nn > N1. Hence,\n≤\n≤\nxn\n\nfor n > N1. Therefore, for n > N1,\n|5 - xn|\n|xn - 5|\n|xn - 5|\n-\n=\n=\n≤\n.\nxn\n|5xn|\n|5xn|\nThere are two ways to proceed here: the squeeze theorem, or still strictly using the definition of a limit. We will\ndo both.\nThe Squeeze Theorem Approach: We know that\n|xn - 5|\n0 ≤\n-\n≤\n,\nxn\nand the left and right hand sides go to 0. Thus,\n=⇒ lim\n-\n= 0\nn→inf\nxn\n\n=⇒ lim\n-\n= 0\nn→inf\nxn\n=⇒ lim\n→ .\nn→inf\nxn\nThe Limits Only Approach: This approach involves εs and Ns but is still useful to know. We know that for\nall ε > 0, ∃N such that |xn - 5| < ε, Hence, let ε = 20ε0 . Hence, theres an N2 such that |xn - 5| < ε = 20ε0 . Let\n1 ≤ 1\nN = max N1, N2 - thus it is true that for all n > N, |xn - 5| < 20ε0 and\n. Hence,\nxn\n|xn - 5|\n-\n=\nxn\n|5xn|\n|xn - 5|\n≤\n20ε0\n<\n= ε0 .\nTherefore, for all ε0 > 0 there exists an N such that for all n ≥ N,\n-\n< ε0 .\nxn\nSeries\nP\nP\nHere I will denote\nn∈N xn (of a sequence xn) as\nxn. In regards to series, there are two main ones to remember:\n1. Geometric series:\n⎧\n⎨ 1\nX\n,\n|a| < 1\nn\n1-a\na = ⎩\nn∈N\ndiverges, |a| ≥ 1.\nP 1\n2. The Harmonic series:\ndiverges. More generally,\nn\n⎧\nX 1\n⎨converges, α > 1\n=⇒\nnα\n⎩\nn∈N\ndiverges,\nα ≤ 1.\nThese main ones are very useful to remember for the comparison test, which we will cover shortly.\nThere are a few ways to determine if a sum converges or diverges.\n\n- The series is Cauchy. In other words, for all ε > 0 there exists an N such that for all n, m > M\ninf\ninf\nm\nX\nX\nX\nxi -\nxi =\nxi < ε.\ni=n\ni=m\ni=n\n(Why does this imply the series converges?)\n- Use algebraic operations on a series. Note that you have to be very careful with these sorts of operations.\nP\nP\nLet\nxn and\nyn converge. Then given constants a, b,\nX\nX\nX\n(axn + byn) = a\nxn + b\nyn,\nhence implying the left hand side converges.\nP\nP\nm\n- If xn ≥ 0 and the sequence {\n}\nis bounded, then\nxn converges. This follows the Monotone\nn=1 xn m\nConverge Theorem (how?).\nSeries Tests\nSeries tests give us a way to check if a series converges or diverges. There are two tests to know:\ni) The Comparison Test. If 0 ≤ xn ≤ yn for all n, then: if yn converges the xn converges, and if xn diverges\nthen yn diverges. This is generally true for all sequences (why?), and this is very helpful for series.\nii) The Ratio Test. Here, let\nxn+1\nlim\n= L.\nn→inf\nxn\nThen,\n- If L < 1 the series converges.\n- If L > 1 the series diverges.\n- If L = 1, we don't know.\nLets look at two examples of series that we can use these tests for.\nProblem 8\nP\nDoes\nconverge?\nn2+1\nP\nYes, using the comparison test. 0 ≤\n≤\nfor all n, and\nconverges. (as stated in the previous section of\nn2 +1\nn2\nn2\nthis review).\nProblem 9\nDoes\nX\nn3n\n(n2 + 1)4n-1\nconverge?\nYes, and we can prove this using both tests (and we will).\n\nUsing the comparison test:\nn3n\n0 ≤ (n2 + 1)4n-1\nn\nn\n= 4 ·\n·\nn2 + 1\nn\n= 4 ·\n·\nn + 1\nn\nn\n≤ 4 ·\n· .\nP n\nFurthermore,\nconverges as it is a geometric series and 3 < 1.\nNow we will use the ratio test:\nn3n+1\nxn+1\n((n+1)2+1)4n\nlim\n= lim\nn3n\nn→inf\nn→inf\nxn\n(n2+1)4n-1\nn + 1\nn2 + 1\n= lim\n·\n·\nn→inf 4\n(n + 1)2 + 1\nn\n=\n< 1.\nHence, this series converges by the ratio test.\nNote that for series of the form\nX 1\nnα ,\nThe ratio test is not particularly helpful, as in sums of this form the limit of the ratio goes to 1.\nBest of luck on your exam!\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100A / 18.1001 Real Analysis\nFall 2020\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Exercise 1.2.10:\nGiven that A, B ⊂ R>0 (both bounded and nonempty), consider the set\nC := {a · b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\n(where := means that we are defining C to be that way). Show that sup C = sup A · sup B.\nThe Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality (abbreviated as AM-GM) states that for n nonnegative real\nnumbers x1, . . . , xn,\nx1 + · · · + xn\n√\nn\n≥\nx1 . . . xn.\nn\nIn the homework, y'all proved the base case of n = 2. Note that this inequality is true for n = 1, but this is a more\ntrivial statement ( x1 ≥√ x1).\nNormally we could try to use Standard Induction to prove this:\n1. First prove the base case (which is already done).\n2. Then, assume the statement is true for some k and show that this implies the statement is true for k + 1\n(where k is an arbitrary natural number).\nHowever, we will instead use a new method that is similar to Standard Induction:\n1. Prove that the statement is true for n = 2k using induction.\n2. Then, show this implies it is true for all natural numbers.\nThe case where k = 1 was done in the homework. So now, assume that the AM-GM inequality is true for some k.\nThen, we want to show that the inequality is true for k + 1:\nx1 + · · · + x2k+1\n(x1 + · · · + x2k ) + (x2k +1 + · · · + x2k+1 )\n=\n.\n2k+1\n2k+1\nNotice that we haven't changed anything here, but we have separated the sum of 2k+1 terms into to sums of 2k\nterms. This allows us to apply what we have assumed:\n√\n√\n2k · ( 2k x1 . . . x2k + 2k x2k +1 . . . x2k+1 )\n≥\n2k+1\n√\n√\n( 2k x1 . . . x2k + 2k x2k +1 . . . x2k+1 )\n=\n.\nNow we can apply the base case with k = 1:\nq √\n√\n2k\n2k\n≥\nx1 . . . x2k ·\nx2k +1 . . . x2k+1\n2k+1√\n=\nx1 . . . x2k+1 .\nThus, we have shown the AM-GM inequality is true for n = 2k for all k ∈ N. To show the AM-GM inequality is\ntrue for all n (not just those which are powers of 2) we want to find the nearest m ≥ n such that m = 2k for some\n\nnonnegative integer k. Let\nx1 + · · · + xn\nμ =\n,\nn\nand let xn+1 = xn2 = · · · = xm = μ. Hence,\nx1 + · · · + xn\nμ =\nn\nm (x1 + · · · + xn)\nn\n=\nm\nx1 + · · · + xn + m-n (x1 + · · · + xn)\nn\n=\nm\nx1 + · · · + xn + (xn+1 + · · · + xm)\n=\n.\nm\nApplying the AM-GM inequality since m = 2k:\n√\nμ ≥\nμ ≥\np\nm\nm\nx1 . . . xm\nx1 . . . xn · μm-n .\nMoving all the μ to the left hand side and dealing with exponents, we get\n√\nμ ≥\nn x1 . . . xn.\nSince μ is the arithmetic mean, we are complete with our proof.\nNow we will work on Exercise 1.2.10.\nStep 1: We want to show that C is bounded (i.e. that the supremum exists). Given that A is bounded, there\nexists an α such that a ≤ α for all a ∈ A. Similarly, there exists a β such that b ≤ β for all b ∈ B. Hence, since A\nand B only contain positive numbers, ab ≤ αβ for all a ∈ A and all b ∈ B. Therefore, C must be bounded as C is\nthe set of all such ab. Proving the existence of a supremum is almost always the first step in proving a statement\nlike this one.\nStep 2: Now that we know it exists, we want to show that sup C = sup A · sup B. We can do this by showing\nthat\nsup C ≤ sup A · sup B and sup C ≥ sup A · sup B\n(a very common technique in analysis). It is clear that\n⎧\n⎨0 ≤ a ≤ sup A ∀a ∈ A .\n⎩0 ≤ b ≤ sup B\n∀b ∈ B\nHence, ab ≤ sup A · sup B for all ab ∈ C. Hence, sup A · sup B is an upper bound for C, and thus\nsup C ≤ sup A · sup B.\nNow for the other direction. Fix b ∈ B (noting of course that b > 0 for all b ∈ B). Then, a ≤ sup C for all a ∈ A.\nb\nThis implies that sup C is an upper bound for A. Since sup A is the least upper bound for A, this implies that for\nb\nall b ∈ B,\nsup C\nsup C\nsup A ≤\n=⇒ b ≤\n∀b ∈ B.\nb\nsup A\nNote that sup A =6\n0 as A =6\n∅, and A ⊂ R>0. Therefore, sup C is an upper bound for B, and hence\nsup A\nsup C\nsup B ≤\n=⇒ sup A · sup B ≤ sup C.\nsup A\n\nTherefore, sup C = sup A · sup B.\nWe leave the following exercise to the student: Show that given A, B ⊂ R≥0 (such that A and B are bounded\nand nonempty), and C defined just as before, then sup C = sup A · sup B. The only di erence between this exercise\nand 1.2.10 is that before we were dealing with sets of only positive numbers, and now we want to include the\npossibility that A and/or B contain 0.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100A / 18.1001 Real Analysis\nFall 2020\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Discuss diagonalization arguments.\nLet's start, where else, but the beginning. With infimum and supremum proofs, we are often asked to show\nthat the supremum and/or the infimum exists and then show that they satisfy a certain property. We had a similar\nproblem during the first recitation:\nProblem 1\nGiven A, B ⊂ R>0 are bounded and nonempty sets, and given the set C := {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}, show that\nsup C = sup A · sup B.\nHowever, we did this problem last time, and will focus on a new one: Problem 7 from PSET 2.\nProblem 2\nShow that the set\nX := {a ∈ R | a < 2, a > 0}\nhas a supremum, and that (sup X)3 = 2.\nIn these sorts of proofs, there are few key steps:\n1. Show that the set X is bounded, which them implies it must have a supremum as a property of the real\nnumbers.\n2. Show that sup X = r ∈ R. To do this, we usually show that sup X ≥ r and sup X ≤ r.\nLet's go through these steps in this problem. Based on the very definition of the set X, we know it must be\nbounded, as there doesn't exist an element of X less than 0, and there certainly aren't any elements greater than 3\n(the choice of 3 is arbitrary but suycient to show it is bounded). Thus, we just have to do step 2. Here, we want to\nshow that (sup X)3 = 2, and thus want to show that (sup X)3 ≤ 2 and (sup X)3 ≥ 2. Let sup X = r for simplicity.\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that r\n> 2. Let's try to intuitively understand why this should give\na contradiction. Given this is the case, then we should be able to subtract a \"small\" h > 0 from r such that\n(r - h)3 > 2, and then r - h is still an upper bound for X. This would be a contradiction, as the supremum is the\nleast upper bound. However, we still need to make this proof more formal by explicitly saying what h is. To do\nthis, consider the following:\n(r - h)3 = r 3 - 3r 2h + 3rh2 - h3\n= r 3 - 3r 2h + h2(3r - h).\nNotice that if we can find an h such that r3 -3r2h ≥ 2, and such that 3r-h > 0, then we will have that (r-h)3 > 2.\nThis would be the contradiction we discussed earlier, and then (sup X)3 ≤ 2. We would have to do something\nsimilar for r < 2 and reach a contradiction, but at this point we leave the rest as an exercise for the reader.\nNow, lets discuss the second item on our to-do list: Diagonalization Arguments. We can use this sort of\nargument to prove some really statements, such as the following:\n\nA For any set A, |P(A)| > |A|.\nB The set of real numbers is uncountable, i.e. |R| > |N|.\nWe will first prove statement B, and then statement A.\nAssume that there exists a bijection between R and N. If this is the case, then we can list the elements of R\nand put them into a table:\nN\n. . .\nR\n2. 7\n2 . . .\n1.\n6 1\n0 . . .\n3.\n1 4 1\n5 . . .\n. . .\nFor each real number in the row i, take the i-th digit (as shown by the bold numbers in the table above). Then\nconsider the real number with those diagonal elements: x = 2.64 . . . . x di ers from the i-th real number in the i-th\ndecimal point, which implies that x cannot be on this table! This is a contradiction, as we assumed that every real\nnumber was on this list (as we assumed there existed a bijection). Therefore, R is uncountable and furthermore\n|R| > |N|.\nNow we prove statement A in a similar way. Assume that there exists a bijection\ng : A →P(A).\nConsider the set T = {a ∈ A | a ∈/ g(a)} ∈P(A). For every a ∈ A, either a is in T or not. If a is in T , then a is not\nin g(a), and then T =6\ng(a). On the other hand if a is not in T , then a is in g(a), which again means T =6\nf(a). In\nany case, T 6= g(a). Therefore, there exists an element of P(A) that isn't achieved by the bijection g, which means\ng is not a bijection. One can see this argument through a table just as we did to show |R| > |N|.\nHere, T is\nP(A) A\ng(x1)\ng(x2)\ng(x3)\n. . .\nx1\nx2\nx3\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\nthe set xis that give value 1 on the diagonal (again shown with the bold numbers).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100A / 18.1001 Real Analysis\nFall 2020\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Recitation 03\nTo-do list:\n1. An example of a set without the Archimedean property.\n2. Discussing the intuition behind open sets with examples.\nLet's get into it. The Archimedean property states that for all x, y ∈ R such that 0 < x < y, there exists an\nn ∈ N such that nx > y. In other words, no real number is infinitely larger than any other real number. This\nproperty feels particularly trivial for the real numbers, but not all ordered sets have such a nice property. For\ninstance, consider the set S of all polynomials with real valued coeycients. To write this formally, we state\n(\n)\nn\nX\nS =\naix i | ai ∈ R, n ∈ N .\ni=0\nWe can turn S into an ordered set by defining what it means for a polynomial to be \"positive\". For S, we will\nPn\nstate that if p(x) =\ni has an > 0 then p(x) ≻ 0. In other words, if the leading coeycient is positive, then\ni=0 aix\np(x) ≻ 0. Hence, p(x) ≻ g(x) if p(x) - g(x) ≻ 0.\nSo the question is, does S satisfy the Achimedean property? Namely, if we are guven p(x), g(x) ∈ S such that\ng(x) ≻ p(x) ≻ 0, does there exist an n ∈ N such that np(x) ≻ g(x)?\nConsider the following example: Let p(x) = 10x2 +5 and g(x) = x3 -3x. Both have positive leading coeycients,\nand thus both are \"positive\". Furthermore, x3 - 3x ≻ 10x2 + 5 as x3 - 10x2 - 3x - 5 ≻ 0. Can we find an n ∈ N\nsuch that\nn(10x 2 + 5) ≻ x 3 - 3x?\nThe answer is no, as x3 - 3x - 10nx2 - 5n has a positive leading coeycient for all n ∈ N. Therefore, S does not\nsatisfy the Archimedian property. In some sense, x3 - 3x is \"infinitely larger\" than 10x2 + 5.\nNow let's start to discuss open sets. A set U ⊂ R is open if for all x ∈ U there exists an ε > 0 such that\n(x - ε, x + ε) ⊂ U. One example of this is the set (0, 1). For any number strictly between 0 and 1, you can find\nsome ε > 0 such that (x - ε, x + ε) ⊂ (0, 1):\nHere, each dot is an x, and the circle around it is a circle of radius ε. Note that ε does not (and generally isn't)\nthe same value for every x.\nIn the PSET, you will be asked to show that for a, b ∈ R, (-inf, a), (a, b), and (b, inf) are open sets.\nBut what isn't an open set? Well, consider a set like [0, 1]. Why isn't this an open set? For the point 1 ∈ [0, 1],\nfor all ε > 0 (1 - ε, 1 + ε) 6⊂ [0, 1].\nIn the PSET, you will be asked to show that an arbitrary union of open sets is open, and that a finite intersection\nof open sets is open. But why isn't an infinite intersection of open sets necessarily open? Here is a common\ncounterexample.\nConsider the sets of the form Un = (0, 1 + 1 ) for n ∈ N. Then, U1 = (0, 2), U2 = (0, 1.5), etc.. It is clear that\nn\nall of these sets are open, however\n\\\nUn = (0, 1].\nn∈N\n\nThis set is NOT open, for the same reason that [0, 1] wasn't open. Hence, infinite intersections of open sets may\nNOT be open.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100A / 18.1001 Real Analysis\nFall 2020\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Well, if Q is open, then\nfor all q ∈ Q, then there exist an ε > 0 such that (q - ε, q + ε) ⊂ Q. Is this true? It isn't!

      "content": "Recitation 06\nTo-do list:\n1. First we will answer any questions there may be on PSETs and lectures.\n2. There are a few remarks about open and closed sets to cover.\n3. Then we will discuss lim sup and lim inf.\nFirst we talked about Problem 7B. Given E ⊂ R, we say that x ∈ R is a cluster point of E if ∀ε, (x - ε, x + ε) ∩\n(E \\ {x}) 6= ∅.\nProblem 4\nWe want to show that the set of cluster points of E (denoted as C) is closed.\nTo show a set is closed, we need to show that the complement of said set is open. What is the complement of the\nset of cluster points of E? Well, negate the statement of the definition of a cluster point: x ∈ R is not a cluster\npoint if there exists an ε such that (x - ε, x + ε) ∩ (E \\ {x}) = ∅.\nRemark 5. Note that when you negate a statement, every ∀ changes to an ∃. For example, let's say we wanted\nto show that the statement \"for all x ∈ R 2x > x\" if a false statement. Then, we simply have to find *one* x that\nmakes this false.\nSo we want to find an ε0 such that (x - ε0, x + ε0) ⊂ Cc . Can you argue that the x values that have this property\nare not cluster points? This exercise is left to the student.\nNow lets discuss some things about open and closed sets. If we want to prove that something is closed, we want\nto show the complement is open. Hence, to show that a set A is closed, Ac must be open. So, for all x ∈/ A, ∃ε\nsuch that\n(x - ε, x + ε) ⊂ Ac ⇐⇒ (x - ε, x + ε) ∩ A = ∅.\nAnother way to prove that a set A is closed is to show that A contains all of it's limit points. In other words, if\ngiven a sequence {xn}n ⊂ A, and xn → x, then x ∈ A.\nHowever, note that showing a set is not open does not show that the set is closed. For example, the sets R\nand ∅ are both open and closed, and the set (0, 1] is neither open nor closed. Keep this in mind when working on\nquestions regarding open and closed sets.\nNow lets discuss lim sup and lim inf. We have seen that if a sequence is strictly increasing and bounded, it must\nconverge to the supremum, but not all sequences are increasing. Consider the sequence:\n{2, -1, 1 + 1\n, - , . . . , 1 +\n-1\n, -\n}.\nn\nn\nWe can visually depict this sequence:\nIt is clear that the infimum is -1, and the supremum is +2, but this doesn't say much about what xn does as\nn →inf. This is why we begin to care about lim inf and lim sup. If we exclude the first 2n terms in our sequence,\n\nwe get that inf = - 1 and sup = 1 + 1 . Hence, taking n →inf, we can get that\nn\nn\nlim inf xn = 0 and lim sup xn = 1.\nThis tells us quite a bit more about the sequence {xn}n.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100A / 18.1001 Real Analysis\nFall 2020\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
