He also wants to eliminate the helium fill gas, to cut manufacturing costs.\nHis new fuel pin design has the following as-manufactured dimensions:\n\n-\nUO2 pellet radius: 4.1 mm\n-\nGap thickness: 10 μm\n-\nZircaloy clad thickness: 0.4 mm\n\ni)\nDuring normal operation, the fuel pellet radius expands by 0.5% due to irradiation\neffects. As a result, the clad and pellet make contact. Assuming a coolant pressure of\n15.5 MPa, calculate the value of the force per unit area exerted by the fuel pellet on\nthe clad, Pi, in this situation. ( Hint: assume that the fuel pellet is perfectly rigid).\n(20%)\n\nii)\nFor the situation described in 'i', calculate the principal stresses in the clad and judge\ntheir acceptability using the Tresca criterion.

The test section of the loop is going to be an annular\nchannel of 1-m length with an inner wall of 1-cm diameter and an outer wall of 2-cm diameter.\nThe inner wall is uniformly heated, while the outer\nwall is adiabatic. In the f irst series of\nexperiments the team wishes to maintain the test section inlet and outlet temperatures at 200°C\nand 250°C, respectively.\n\ni) Find the mass flow rate and power at which the boiling crisis occurs in this situation.\nYou may assume that the specific heat is constant in the subcooled region. To predict the\nboiling crisis, use either the Tong-68 or the CISE-4 correlation (given below), whichever\nis appropriate for the situation of interest. (25%)\n\nTong -68 correlation\nJ.

Buongiorno, 2008\n\nFINAL EXAM (SOLUTION)\n\nPART A (20%)\n\nCLOSED BOOK\n\nFlow boiling: boiling in a flow system. It occurs in both the PWR and BWR cores under normal\noperating conditions.\n\nSubcooled boiling: boiling of a fluid whose bulk temperature is below the saturation\ntemperature. It is the only type of boiling that takes place in the PWR core (hot channel) under\nnormal operating conditions. It also occurs in the lower section of all BWR fuel assemblies.\n\nNucleate boiling: liquid-vapor phase transition via bubble nucleation, which typically occurs at\nmicrocavities present on the heated surface. It occurs in both PWR and BWR cores.\n\nFilm boiling: boiling in the presence of a continuous vapor film in contact with the heated\nsurface. Does not occur in either PWR or BWR core under normal operating conditions.\n\nPool boiling: boiling of a fluid that is macroscopically stagnant. Does not occur in either PWR\nor BWR core under normal operating conditions.\n\nTransition boiling: on the boiling curve it is the region between the DNB and the Leidenfrost\npoints. Does not occur in either PWR or BWR core under normal operating conditions.\n\nDeparture from nucleate boiling (DNB): transition from the nucleate boiling regime to the film\nboiling regime. It results in a large sudden reduction of the heat transfer coefficient. This is the\nboiling crisis relevant to the PWR core situation. However, it does not occur in the PWR under\nnormal operating conditions.\n\nDryout: disappearance of the liquid film in annular flow. It results in a large sudden reduction\nof the heat transfer coefficient. This is the boiling crisis relevant to the BWR core situation.\nHowever, it does not occur in the BWR under normal operating conditions.\n\nCritical Flow: the maximum flow rate (or mass flux) that a (compressible) fluid can attain as it\nis discharged from a high-pressure component through a fixed-geometry nozzle. Does not occur\nin either PWR or BWR core under normal operating conditions.\n\nii)\nFor a given fluid, and fixed operating pressure and mass flow rate, nucleate boiling has the\nhighest htc. The htc is generally higher at subcooled boiling conditions than saturated boiling\nconditions because the temperature difference driving the heat transfer is higher. Forced\nconvection of a single-phase liquid comes next, and film boiling last, because in film boiling the\nsurface is in contact with a slow moving vapor film, which has a very poor thermal conductivity.\nTherefore the correct htc ranking is:\n\nSubcooled nucleate boiling: 1\nSaturated nucleate boiling: 2\nSingle-phase (liquid) convection: 3\nFilm boiling: 4\n\nPART B\nJ. Buongiorno, 2008\n\n(80%)\nProblem 1 (40%) - PWR fuel pin with a thin gap and no fill gas\ni)\nThe pellet radial displacement is uf=0.005 Rf≈20.5 μm, where Rf=4.1 mm is the as-manufactured\npellet radius. Thus, the clad radial displacement is uc= uf - tgap ≈10.5 μm, where tgap ≈10 μm is\nthe as-manufactured gap thickness. Using the thin-shell theory, the principal stresses in the clad\nare:\n\nσr = -(Pi+Po)/2\n\n(1)\nσθ = (Pi-Po)Rc/tc\nσz = -PoRc/(2tc)\n\nwhere tc=0.4 mm and Rc=4.11 mm are the as-manufactured thickness and inner radius of the\nclad, respectively, Po=15.5 MPa, and Pi represents the force per unit area exerted by the pellet on\nthe clad. (Note that there is no fill gas, so no internal pressure shows up in the equations for the\nstresses; also note that Pi is a radial force, so it does not show up in the expression for the axial\nstress, σz)\n\nHooke's law for the tangential strain is:\n\nεθ= 1/E [σθ-ν(σz+σr)]\n\n(2)\n\nSubstituting Eqs (1) into (2), and recognizing that εθ=uc/Rc≈0.0026, one gets one equation in the\nonly unknown Pi:\n\n⎭\n⎬\n⎫\n⎩\n⎨\n⎧\n⎥⎦\n⎤\n⎢⎣\n⎡\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\n=\n)\n(\no\ni\nc\nc\no\nc\nc\no\ni\nP\nP\nt\nR\nP\nt\nR\nP\nP\nE\nν\nεθ\n\nWhich can be solved for Pi to give:\n\nJ.

(1), one gets σr≈-23.7 MPa, σθ≈168.2 MPa and σz≈-79.6 MPa.\nThe Tresca criterion is:\n\nmax{\n}\nσ r -σθ , σ r -σ z , σ z -σθ ≈247.8 MPa > Sy=200 MPa\n\nTherefore, the criterion is not satisfied and the stresses are not acceptable.\n\niii)\nThe idea is unattractive for the following reasons:\n- As shown in part 'ii', the fuel-clad mechanical interaction is too severe, and will likely result in\nrupture of the clad\n- It is questionable that the gap thermal resistance would be in fact reduced with this design,\nbecause the elimination of the fill gas means that, prior to clad-fuel contact, heat transfer across\nthe gap can occur only by radiation, which is a poor heat transfer mechanism.\n- Depending on the service lifetime of the fuel pin, a thin clad may not be acceptable from a\ncorrosion viewpoint\n\nThe merits of the idea are:\n- Fewer parasitic neutron absorptions in the clad, which is thinner\n- Elimination of the fill gas, thus, possibly, a reduction in manufacturing costs\n\nProblem 2 (40%) - Thermal-Hydraulic Analysis of a Boiling Channel\ni)\nThe mass flow rate (m& =GA) and power (Q& = q′′πDiL ) are related by the energy balance:\n\nGACp f Tout\nTin\nq\nDiL\nπ\n, (\n-\n) = ′′\n\n(3)\n\nWhere Tin=200°C, Tout=250°C, A=π/4(D 2\no -D 2\ni )=2.36×10-4 m2 is the flow area, and L=1 m.\n\nSince the heat flux is uniform, the boiling crisis will occur at the channel outlet. As the outlet\ntemperature is below the saturation temperature, the thermal-hydraulic conditions in the channel\nare subcooled, for which the relevant boiling crisis is departure from nucleate boiling (vs dryout).\nTherefore, the appropriate correlation for this problem is Tong-68.\n\nJ.

Since the mixture is saturated, thermal\nequilibrium can be assumed, and thus the flow quality is equal to the equilibrium quality.\n\niii)\nThe void fraction is related to quality and slip ratio by the fundamental relation of two-phase\nflow,\nα =\n. As the flow rate, pressure, power and inlet temperature are fixed (as\nρ g\n1-x\n1+\n⋅S ⋅\nρ f\nx\nper the problem statement), the quality is also fixed.

Thus:\n\n14.9 m3/kg = M w = vw1 = vw2(T2,Pw2)\n\nVa\nThen from the steam tables, the pressure of water in air at the\nfinal state is P w2=15 kPa, and\nuw2=2661 kJ/kg. Finally, from Eq.

Also, the change in gas volume\nduring the transient depends only on the amount of salt extracted, which is not affected\nby the type of gas. Then Eq. (7) suggests that also the change in pressure P2/P1 is\nindependent of the type of gas. Bottom line: final pressure and temperature are expected\nto be the same whether one uses nitrogen or helium.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.312 Engineering of Nuclear Reactors\nFall 2015\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
