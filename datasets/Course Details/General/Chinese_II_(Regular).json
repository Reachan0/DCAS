Cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, deliberate interference with the integrity of the work of others, fabrication or falsification of data, and other forms of academic dishonesty are considered serious offenses for which disciplinary penalties can be imposed.\"\n\nYou are expected to finish the writing assignments independently, without using online translation applications such as Google Translate, or receiving help from family and / or friends for translation assignments, compositions, etc.\n\nNote on Disabilities\n\nStudents who feel they may need an accommodation based on a disability should contact the instructor privately to discuss their specific needs.\n\nLearning Objectives / Goals of the Course\n\nThe focus of this course is to train you to function successfully in Chinese culture using Mandarin as your primary language. We assume that you are interested in interacting with Chinese people in a way that will permit you to pursue professional goals in some segment of Chinese society. This means that we expect you to learn how to present yourself in a way that a Chinese person will find comfortable. If a Chinese person has to adapt to you in order to communicate, it is not likely that you can accomplish what you intend in China.\n\nThis course will help you develop skills in Mandarin Chinese to communicate across ethnic, cultural, ideological and national boundaries and to develop an understanding of Chinese interpersonal behavioral culture and related thought patterns. At the end of the course, you will be expected to perform in speaking, listening, reading and writing Chinese at a basic level of proficiency. You should also demonstrate a level of cultural understanding suitable for correct performance of assigned tasks in Chinese (e.g., how to make a request in an appropriate way). This means that we will pay attention to the way you behave as much as we attend to your use of the language. We are really coaching you on how to behave in Chinese culture. This is a long-term process, but we will get started on it right away. In order to do this, you will have to perform.\nPerformance, your performance\n, is the focus of this course.\n\nWe assure you that if you do what we ask of you on a daily basis, you will learn Chinese. If you learn Chinese, you will do well in this program. Therefore, our evaluation (i.e., your grades) will be based largely on your daily performances. The following section should be read carefully and thoroughly understood.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe grade for this course will be based on the following table:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nDaily classroom performance including performance of the basic conversation, exercises, participation in class activities, quizzes, and / or homework\n\n50%\n\nOral report (5% of each)\n\n15%\n\nReview tests (5% of each)\n\n25%\n\nFinal oral interview\n\n10%\n\nYour grades in the course are largely determined by classroom performance. The reasons for this emphasis are many, but the main reason is that we are convinced that if you follow the course with consistency and persistence, you will develop significant demonstrable skills in Chinese by the end of the semester. Your daily performance on the activities assigned on the weekly schedule will be graded on the following four-point scale unless indicated otherwise:\n\nPOINTS\n\nDESCRIPTIONS\n\nPerformance that promises interaction with a native with no difficulty, discomfort, or misunderstanding; no English hesitation noises in speaking and no \"foreignisms\" in the written work.\n\n3.5\n\nPerformance comprehensible to native speakers, but some non-patterned errors that would hinder smooth interaction with them.\n\nPerformance comprehensible to a native, but evident weakness or patterned errors.\n\n2.5\n\nCommunication requires much help from interlocutor.\n\nPerformance puts burden on interlocutor. To facilitate communication, a Chinese-speaking native would probably avoid using Chinese with you.\n\n1.5\n\nBarely prepared, little competency evident.\n\nEvidently unprepared, unable to perform.\n\nAbsent.\n\nMost class sessions will be graded on a scale of 8 possible points--4 for \"performance of memorized basic conversations\" and the other 4 for overall practice based on drills, communicative exercises, quizzes, and / or written assignments. Grades will be kept for every assigned performance. You will need a minimum of 60% to pass the course. Percentage Grade Scale:\n\nA = 100-93.4\n\nA- = 93.3-90\n\nB+ = 89.9-86.7\n\nB = 86.6-83.4\n\nB- = 83.3-80\n\nC+ = 79.9-76.7\n\nC = 76.6-73.4\n\nC- = 73.3-70\n\nD+ = 69.9-66.7\n\nD = 66.6-63.4\n\nD- = 63.3-60\n\nF = below 60\n\nGrades and comments will be recorded online on Engrade. You should check this daily to track your progress. If you have a question about a grade, ask your instructor. There is\nno curve\nin this course. You are competing against the communicative demands of the language, not against each other. Each person will have to perform to receive credit; but there is nothing in the grading system to discourage collaborative efforts to achieve the highest level of performance possible.\n\nIf you must miss class, please let us know well in advance if possible. You will be allowed to make up no more than\nTwo\nmissed classes in this course unless you provide a doctor's note or a note from your academic advisor to the instructor in advance. The make-ups will be conducted by the instructors by appointment and will cover the work missed. Make-ups are to be arranged within two days of your return to class; missed classes which are not made up within the above time frame or which exceed two in number will be entered as zeroes in your grade record. It is vital that you maintain communication with us if you miss class. You are expected to be in class each hour ready to perform; we do not have the resources to set up a separate program for those who cannot make it to class each hour each day.\n\nPreparation for Classes and Policies\n\nAll classes are conducted in Chinese only\n. English will not be used except when asked for with a Chinese request. Therefore, you must come to class well-prepared in the assigned materials. Here is the\nsecret to success\nin learning Chinese: The most important materials are the\nAudio Files\n. Whenever possible, your preparation should emphasize the audio files. Below are important comments for you:\n\nBe sure to come to every class; frequent cutting equals certain disaster! We cannot emphasize enough the importance of regular class attendance and of getting out of each class the maximum possible. You should always participate actively, paying close attention to everything you hear and see and anticipating the responses to questions even when you're not called upon.\n\nWe can't overstress the importance of\nthorough preparation before each class\n. You should plan on spending\ntwo hours\nin preparation for each hour of class. This includes studying the explanations in the textbook and, especially, listening to and repeating after the audio recordings. Work with the recordings as actively as possible and always be thinking of the meaning of what you are hearing and saying.\n\nMemory work will be a very important part of the course. When we begin conversation, you should memorize the assigned conversation that constitutes the core of each lesson by working intensively with the audio files;\ndo not rely on reading the romanization in your textbook\n. Memorize each basic conversation thoroughly, so you can perform it in class accurately and fluently. It is essential to internalize the new words, grammar patterns, and cultural behavior so they will be readily available to you for your own use when needed. Memorization will greatly aid your fluency and naturalness of speaking. Students sometimes question the necessity of repetition, drill, and memorization. Certainly, these are only the first steps leading to our ultimate goal of communicative competence; however, they are very important steps, since they firmly establish in your brain the sounds and structures of the language for you to draw on later in your own speech. We hope that you understand the importance of these activities and ask that you work hard at them.\n\nWritten homework will be due\nin class\n. Late homework will be accepted with a penalty (10% off per day) and will not be accepted two days late, except in cases of serious medical or family emergency. \"\nExtra work\n\"\nto make up for missed homework later on will not be accepted for this class.\n\nNo make-up quiz\nor\nreview test\n. However, the lowest\nThree\ngrades of your daily performance will be dropped toward your semester grade.\n\nTo give you as much practice as possible in using Chinese, starting with the\nsecond\nclass and continuing through the end of the course,\nChinese only is to be used during the first 45 minutes of every class\n. If you have questions that can be asked or answered only in English, please: (1) ask during the last 5 minutes of class; (2) ask the instructor right after class is over; (3) make an appointment to meet with the instructor individually; or (4) communicate with the instructor via e-mail. In our classes we want to create as \"Chinese\" an atmosphere as possible and get you used to thinking only in Chinese; if we were to revert to English every few minutes, this would be hard to accomplish.\n\nTo become a successful learner of Chinese, your goal is to know both traditional and simplified characters. However, we will begin with simplified characters in Chinese I and Chinese II. After you have gained a solid foundation of Chinese writing system, we will systematically introduce traditional characters so that you will get good exposure. In Chinese II, we will learn about 200 characters.\n\nPlease do all writing (including homework and tests) in no. 2 pencil, black ink, or blue ink. Please do not use very light pencils or red or green ink.\n\nFinal Comments\n\nThis course is the result of years of experience in teaching, and is the best possible first- level curriculum we can devise. The instructors do their best to make this as enjoyable an experience as possible; however, you must do the work and learn the material. Ultimately, your attitude toward this endeavor will be the biggest single factor in your achievement, as learning as a class requires a great amount of cooperation with both classmates and instructors. Your teachers are determined to give you the best possible opportunity to learn the language. If you ever think we are not living up to this, please feel free to discuss your concerns with your instructors. If we think you are not doing your best, we will be sure to let you know.\n\nWe're excited about having you in our first-year Chinese language course this year and, while you should be prepared for a lot of hard work, we think you'll be surprised at how much you will have learned by the end of the semester.\n\nClassroom Etiquette\n\nNo caps.\n\nNo eating or chewing gum.\n\nDo not cross your legs when you are seated.\n\nDo not put your hands in your pockets when you do the dialog performance.\n\nHand in your homework to your teacher\nwith both hands\n.\n\nWhen the teacher says \"Women shangke ba (\nLet's begin class\n)\" to begin class, students are expected to respond with \"Laoshi hao (\nHow are you teacher?\n)\" to greet their teacher.\n\nWhen the teacher says \"Women xiakele (\nWe end class now\n)\" at the end of class, students are expected to say \"Xiexie laoshi (\nThank you, teacher\n)\" to show their appreciation.\n\nWhen you write your teacher an email, start with \"Laoshi hao.\" Do not start with \"Hi\" or \"Hello\", which are considered inappropriate in this situation.\n\nIf you must bring a cell phone to class, make certain it is turned off. If your cell phone rings during class, you will be asked to leave immediately.",
