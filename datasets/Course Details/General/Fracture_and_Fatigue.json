Carbon can inhibit the dislocation motion required for\nductile deformation.\n4) Geometry: Plane stress vs. Plane strain. Thicker plates (plane strain)\nhave a higher DBTT. For thin plates (plane stress) the deformation\nzone size is roughly equal to the thickness. Fracture can occur by\nductile tearing, etc.\n5) Work Hardening\n5b.\nChalk is an ionic solid with no significant dislocation mobility. Therefore, it is\nvery brittle and the principal crack-driving stresses are those that are normal to the\ncrack face (i.e. those which are oriented 45° to the axis of the specimen).\n\nIn contrast, Plasticene is a polymer capable of significant plastic deformation.\nFailure is ductile and occurs via shear. Shear stresses are maximum normal to the\naxis of the specimen\n\n5c.\nTempering of glass is a thermomechanical processing step that induces a residual\ncompressive stress in the surface of the glass. The residual compressive stress\nsuppresses the growth of cracks on the surface of the glass. When glass is loaded\nin tension, failure almost always initiates from surface flaws. For the case of\ntempered glass, before the applied tensile stress can exert any tensile load on the\ncracks, it must first overcome the residual compressive stress that exists due to the\ntempering process, and thus tempered glass is more resistant to tensile fracture\nthan ordinary glass, and can sustain larger tensile loads.\n\nThe process of tempering occurs by cooling the glass surface (using jets of cool\nair or water) while it is still hot and able to flow. The cooling causes the outer\nsurface to contract, while the inner core is still hot and flows along with the\ncontracting outer surfaces. When the core finally cools, it contracts and puts the\nouter surface into residual compression, while the core is put into residual tension.\nTempering of glass is somewhat analogous to shot-peening of metals as it\nrepresents a processing step which induces a beneficial compressive residual\nstress in the surface layer. Tempered glass has been used for many applications\n(e.g. automobile windshields).\n\nProblem 6."

As we did in class, evaluate the ratio of the plane strain radius to the plane\nstress radius for θ = 0° and for θ = 45°.

Calculate the minimum\nnumber of days required to determine the threshold stress intensity factor range, ∆Kth, of\na material at a cyclic frequency of 2 Hz, if ∆Kth is defined as the threshold corresponding\nto a growth rate of no more than 10-11 m/cycle and if the resolution of the crack detection\ntechnique is 0.03 mm.\n\n4: In Problem Set 2, you computed the magnitude of the bursting pressure for a\npiston/cylinder fabricated from a peak-aged aluminum alloy (problem 10.7 in Fatigue of\nMaterials). Consider an identical piston-cylinder arrangement, where the cylinder\ncontains a semi-circular flaw 1.0 mm in radius, instead of an elliptical flaw. If the fatigue\ncrack growth behavior of the aluminum alloy is characterized by the relationship da/dN =\n3 x 10-10 (∆K)2.5, where da/dN is in m/cycle, and ∆K is in MPa m1/2, how many pressure\ncycles could the cylinder withstand before bursting?\n\n5. The design stress of the tail section of a prototype military aircraft is such that it\nnever exceeds a stress corresponding to one-third of the yield strength, and the cyclic\nservice loading is expected to vary from a minimum stress (σmin) of one-twelfth of the\nyield strength to a maximum stress (σmax) of one-third of the yield strength (i.e. R =\n0.25). The tail section is inspected with an ultrasonic non-destructive testing method,\nwith a resolution limit of 0.01 in.\nAssuming that (1) the stress intensity factor for any defects present in the tail section\nis given by:\n\nI\nK\na\nσ\nπ\ninf\n=\n\n(1)\nwhere σ infis the far-field applied stress and a is the crack length, and (2) the growth of\nfatigue cracks is governed by the Paris law\n\nm\nda\nC( K)\ndN =\n∆\n\n(2)\nwhere da/dN is the fatigue crack growth rate per cycle, ∆K is the stress intensity factor\nrange, and C and m are material constants, derive expressions for\n(i)\nthe critical crack length in the tail section\n(ii)\nthe lifetime of the tail section in terms of the material properties (i.e. the\nyield strength, C, m, plane strain fracture toughness, etc.)"
