See Fig. 2(a) in Taleyarkhan (2004).\n\nThe Experiment\nThe experimental design:\nTaleyarkhan controlled the experiment by repeating the\nprocess with combinations of:\nC3D6O / C3H6O\nwith / without cavitation\nwith / without neutron pulses\n\nThe Experiment\nHow could their results show they were\ndoing fusion?\n- With (C3D6O, cavitation, PNG):\n- Emitted neutrons are at the right energy and\ncoincident with sonoluminescence\n- Tritium production\n- Without one of (C3D6O, cavitation, PNG):\n- No detection of fusion-generated neutrons\n- No tritium surplus\n\nThe Results!\nTritium Count\nFigure removed for copyright reasons. See Fig. 11 in Taleyarkhan (2004).\n\nThe Results!\nNeutron Count\n(error bars are 1SD)\nFigure removed for copyright reasons.

See Fig. 5(a) in Taleyarkhan (2002).\n\nThe Results!\n- No neutrons or tritium increase from\nbackground levels was detected in any\ncontrol experiments (without deuterium,\ncavitation, or neutron nucleation)\n- D-D fusion-like neutrons and\nsignificantly increased tritium levels were\ndetected in full experimental setup!!!\n\nThe Results!\n- When all parameters were positive\n- Tritium count increased by 15 cpm above\nbaseline (2.5 SD)\n- <2.5 MeV Neutron count increased by 4% over\n(~4SD) non-cavitating levels\n- These effects were not statistically observed\nwhen one or more parameters were\nnegative.\n\n\"The observation of statistically significant T\nactivity increases only in chilled (~0°C)\ncavitated C3D6O, coupled with evidence for\nneutron emissions in chilled cavitated C3D6O,\nand the absence of neutron emissions and T\nproduction in irradiated control tests with\nC3H6O, complemented by confirmatory\nmodeling and HYDRO code simulations,\nsuggest the possibility of D-D fusion during\nacoustic cavitation experiments with C3D6O\"\n- Taleyarkhan et al.\n\nControversy\n- Desktop fusion has been a touchy subject\nsince the 1989 fiasco\n- Some people within ORNL and within\nScience tried to stop the publication\n- Another group within ORNL quickly\nfollowed up with an attempt to repeat the\nexperiment.\n\nControversy\n\"Nuclear Fusion in Collapsing Bubbles--Is It There? An Attempt to\nRepeat the Observation of Nuclear Emissions from\nSonoluminescence\"\n-D. Shapira and M. Saltmarsh (ORNL)\n\"Using the same cavitation apparatus, a\nmore sophisticated data acquisition system,\nand a larger scintillator detector, we find no\nevidence for 2.5-MeV neutron emission\ncorrelated with sonoluminescence form\ncollapsing bubbles.\"\n\nControversy\nShapira and Saltmarsh found\n- No significant neutron count increases\n- No significant neutron-SL coincidences\n- Tritium levels...not measured.\n\nRebuttal\nTaleyarkhan & co were not deterred; they\nthanked Shapira and Saltmarsh for the\nscientific criticism, and repeated the\nexperiment.\n\nRebuttal\nAdditional evidence of nuclear\nemissions during acoustic cavitation\n\n2004, American Physical Review\n\"Additional evidence of nuclear\nemissions during acoustic cavitation\"\nR.

See Fig. 1 in Milora, et al. (1986).\n\nCurrent Fast Valve Cons\n- The current valve is only 4mm in diameter.\n- Time is taken to accelerate the striking\nmass 2mm before colliding with the plug.\n- The valve begins to open 1.75 ms after\nbeing energized.\n- The valve takes another 1.8 ms to fully\nopen.\n\nHow a mass driver works\n- A High Voltage pulse is sent to the coil.\n- A current is induced in the conductive\narmature.\n- The resultant magnetic fields repel.\n- Demo is 300v, 5J\n\nFull sized model\n- A coil of 12 gauge magnet wire at the base\nreceives a 16000v, 12 KJ pulse from the\ncapacitors.\n- A current is induced in the .08Kg\naluminum ring.\n- The ring is accelerated along the guide\ntube towards the energy dissipater.\n\nMath\n- The electric discharge lasts approximately\n.1ms and peaks around 200 MWatts then\ngradually rings down.\n- The ring is accelerated to 300m/s\n(1000ft/s). Kinetic energy is 3600J.\n- Acceleration is 3,000,000m/s^2. Force is\n240,000N(60,000lbs) Plenty to open a\nlarge high pressure valve.\n\nProposed design cross section\n\nAction\n\nThis new valve could cut the\nopening time by a factor of 10.\nReference:\nMilora, S.

Probably not until\nafter power from magnetic confinement\n- Research possibilities are most promising\nfor now, hopefully will keep NIF funded\n\nWorks Consulted\n- National Ignition Facility Website:\nhttp://www.llnl.gov/nif/\n- LANL Inertial Confinement Website:\nhttp://www.lanl.gov/ICF/intro.shtml\n- UC Berkeley Inertial Fusion Energy Website:\nhttp://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html\n- Inertial Electrostatic Confinement:\nhttp://www.lanl.gov/ICF/intro.shtml"

      "content": "Fusion Reactors: The Ultimate Nuclear Power Plant\nRon Parker\nProfessor\nDepartments of Electrical Engineering\nand Nuclear Science and Engineering\n\nFusion Reactors: The Ultimate Nuclear Power Plant\n\n- A fusion reactor would have several of the attractive features of present-day\nnuclear power plants:\n\nAbundant fuel supply\n\nEfficient conversion of mass to energy\n\nNo air pollution or contribution to global warming\n\n- But it would not have the critical negative concerns that have stopped the\ndevelopment of fission reactors:\n\nNo risk of uncontrolled energy release\n\nGreatly reduced quantity of high level waste\n\nGreatly reduced threat to non-proliferation of weapons material\n\nA Fusion Reactor Would Have Abundant Fuel Supply\n\n- The first fusion reactor would probably burn two isotopes of Hydrogen,\nDeuterium and Tritium, which differ from Hydrogen in the number of\nneutrons in the nucleus.\n\nD + T ⇒ He + neutron + 17.6 MeV\n\n- The ratio of naturally occurring Deuterium to Hydrogen atoms is about\n1:6000. Said another way, there are more than 1013 tons of Deuterium in the\nsurface waters of the earth. This is truly an inexhaustible fuel supply!\n\n- Tritium is radioactive (β-emitter) and decays with a half-life of about 12\nyears. Therefore it does not occur naturally and must be bred in the fusion\nreactor, for example through the nuclear reaction (Natural Lithium is ~ 92.5%\n7Li)\n\n7Li + neutron ⇒ 4He + T + neutron - 2.49 MeV\n\n6Li + neutron ⇒ 4He + T + 4.8 MeV\n\nThe Lithium from land deposits or sea water is sufficient for thousands of years'\nenergy supply\n\nA Fusion Reactor Would Have Abundant Fuel Supply (Cont'd)\n\n- While the first generation fusion reactor would burn D-T, a second generation\nreactor would likely burn only Deuterium. This requires some advance of\npresent day plasma physics, but would greatly simplify the fuel cycle.\n\nLike Fission, Fusion Efficiently Converts Mass to Energy\n\nIn Fission, the energy release is about 1 MeV per Nucleon\n\nIn D-T Fusion, the energy release is about 3.5 MeV per Nucleon\n\nBy comparison, fossil fuels are grossly inefficient, less than 1 eV per Nucleon!\n\nThis efficiency translates to correspondingly smaller requirements for the fuel\nsupply system and waste disposal:\n\nTo generate 1000 MW in one day requires 9000 tons of coal and generates\n30,000 tons of CO2 (plus other noxious gases, e.g., SO2 and NO2). To generate\nthe same amount of energy from fusion requires about 2.5 pounds of D + T and\nmakes 2 pounds of He!\n\nFusion Reactors, Like Fission Reactors Do Not Contribute to\nAir Pollution or Global Warming\n\n- There are no routine emissions from fission or fusion reactors\n\n- Interestingly, coal plants release more radioactive gases (Radon) than fission\nplants!\n\nIn a Fusion Reactor There is No Threat of an Uncontrolled\nEnergy Release\n\nThe amount of fuel in the reactor at any time is sufficient to burn for only ~ 10 s.\nFuel is continuously supplied and can be shut off by a simple valve, much like\nthe way fuel is supplied to a gas burner.\n\nIn addition, fusion reactions are easily extinguished by injection of heavier\nimpurity gases or a \"poison pellet\".\n\nA \"melt-down\" cannot occur! Fusion reactors are passively safe.\n\nA Fusion Reactor Would Produce Negligible Quantities of\nHigh-Level Waste\n\nNo Actinides are produced in the fusion fuel cycle\n\nThe neutron from D-T fusion will cause some activation as it interacts with\nmaterial walls. But structural materials can be used which minimize the\nproduction of radioactive isotopes and their environmental consequences.\n\nAdvanced designs for fusion reactors permit recycling of materials or shallow\nburial about 100 years after shutdown.\n\nSo, If the Potential is so Great, Why Aren't We Building a\nFusion Reactor ?\n\nWe are, but why did it take so long?\n\n- Lack of Interest in Developing New Energy Resources, especially in the US.\n\nThis is in spite of the following argument, which is by no means new:\n\n- Assume that the World's population grows to 10 billion over the next 50\nyears, and that the World per-capita usage of energy doubles during this time\n(still a factor of 3 short of the US per capita usage!) Then a minimum of\n15,000 new plants operating at 1 GW will be needed by 2050. (Some\nestimates are far greater.) How will this power be generated?\n\n- As with a new generation of fission plants, the push to develop fusion may\ncome from the rapidly growing energy demand from countries with rapidly\ndeveloping economies, e.g., China and India.\n\n- Choosing a career in energy R&D looks like a good choice!\n\nThe Fusion Process\n-D and T are both positively\ncharged and repel each other\nthrough the Coulomb force\n-If D and T ions manage to\ntouch then the nuclear force\ntakes over and turns D + T ⇒\nHe(3.5MeV) + n(14.1MeV)\n-Repulsion is overcome by\nincreasing the speed or energy\nof D and T...in a hot fusion\nplasma, the D and T nuclei\nare hot enough to fuse...\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFusion Power Generation\n-In steady-state, the energy from\nthe fusion reactions are radiated\nto the first wall and blanket.\n-Tritium is not available naturally\nbut can be readily bred with\nlithium.\n-The 14.1MeV neutron is\nabsorbed into a blanket\ncontaining lithium in order to\nbreed tritium.\n-The hot blanket and first wall is\ncooled; the thermal energy Is\nextracted from the coolant for\npower generation.\nSuperconducting\nMagnet\nD + T\nBlanket\n(Containing\nLithium)\nPlasma\nShielding\nStructure\nHeat\nExchanger\nVacuum\nVessel\nD\nT + 4He\n4He\nDeuterium\nFuel\nTritium\nSeparation of\nTritium and\nHelium\nSteam Boiler\nTurbine and Generator\nHelium\nElectric Power\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFusion Energy Requirements\n-Need enough particles to fuse: n\n-Need to keep the plasma together long enough for fusion\nreactions to occur: τ\n-Need enough energy for the particles to fuse : T\nSo the product n τ T must be large enough to sustain fusion\nevents at a sufficient level to produce net power\n\nFor ignition, we need:\nBut how do we confine a 230 Million K plasma?\nCharge particles are susceptible to E&M fields...Magnetic Confinement..\n\nForces of Fields on Plasma\n-The plasma now feels a\nforce from the magnetic\nfield\n-Ions and electrons follow\nthe field lines\n-Plasma is confined\n-More organization\n-A linear device, however,\nhas end losses!\nIon\nElectron\nMagnetic Field Lines\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nTokamak Coils\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nThe largest fusion experiments have approached\nenergy breakeven\nCourtesy of Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory."

the plasma in\nequilibrium an OH-PF\nfield system is\nneeded\n- The toroidal current is\nnormally driven by a\ntransformer which is\ninherently pulsed\nPF Coil\n\nHow can we resolve this\nproblem?\n- Approach #1 Advanced tokamak operation\n- Approach #2 The stellarator\n\nThe Advanced Tokamak\nk\nWave\nPlasma\n- The advanced\ntokamak achieves\nsteady state by non-\ninductive current drive\n- Directed RF waves\ntrap and drag\nelectrons with the\nwave generating a\ncurrent\nTop View\n\nThis works but...\n- Current drive efficiency is low\nPRF(watts) ≈10 ICD(amps)\n- For our reactor I = 17 MA\n- With efficiencies this implies PRF ≈340 MW\n- This is unacceptable from an economic point\nof view\n\nIs there any way out?\n- Possibly\n- In a torus there is a naturally driven transport current\n- It is known as the bootstrap current JB\n- No current drive is required\n- If enough JB current flows (75%), the current drive\nrequirements can be dramatically reduced\n\nHow much bootstrap current\nflows?\n-\nThe formula for the bootstrap fraction is\n-\nTo make fB = 75% requires a combination of high pressure and\nlow current\n5 / 2\n*\n3 / 2\n1 /

catastrophic collapse of the p and I\n- Major disruptions must be avoided in a\nreactor or ITER\n\nSpecific Plasma limitations\n-\nImax is limited by kink stability condition\n-\nThe elongation κ is limited by vertical instabilities\n-\nBut Imin is limited by transport: τE ∼IM\n-\nBeta is limited by the no wall Troyon limit\n-\nThis generates too low a bootstrap

IM\n- A conducting wall raises\nthe β limit by as much as\na factor of 2\n\nBut the wall has a finite conductivity\n- A finite σ wall slows down\nγ, but leaves βcrit the\nsame as without a wall\n- This slow growing mode\nis known as the resistive\nwall mode\n- It is a major impediment\nto steady state operation\nIdeal mode\nRWM\nCritical b/a\n\nCan the resistive wall mode be\nstabilized?\n- Feedback may work but is somewhat complicated\n- Plasma flow can stabilize the mode but high flow\nvelocities v ∼vthermal are needed and are difficult to\ninitiate and maintain\n- Plasma kinetic effects may also play an important role\n- This is a crucial unresolved problem in tokamak research\n\nAny other MHD reactor\nproblems?\n- Edge localized modes (ELMs)\n- These are bursts of plasma energy from the plasma\nedge that occur when the pressure gets too high\n- MHD modes driven by the edge ∇p and J\n- The edge acts like a pressure relief valve\n- This should be a good way to control and stabilize the\nedge plasma pressure\n\nBut\n- There are several types\nof ELMs\n- Most are bad\n- Type I = bad\n- Type II = good\n- Type III = bad\n- Difficult to predict which\ntype ELMs will be present\n- Another very important\nMHD problem\nIII\nI\nII\n\nAny more problems?\n- The neoclassical tearing mode (NTM)\n- Resistive tearing mode including toroidal trapped particle\neffects\n- Requires a finite seed island to grow (e.g. due to\nsawteeth)\n- NTMs can be excited at lower β than ideal MHD modes\n- The m=3/n=2 mode can lead to enhanced transport\n- The m=2/n=1 mode can lead to disruptions\n\nPreventing NTMs\n- Preventing NTMs #1: Reduce seed island by sawtooth\ndestabilization (e.g. ICCD at the q = 1 surface)\n- Preventing NTMs #2: Reduce island width by external\ncontrol (e.g. ECCD at q = 3/2 surface)\n\nHappy endings for AT problems?\n- Stabilize the resistive wall mode\n(feedback, rotation, kinetic effects)\n- Control ELMs (edge ∇p driven modes,\naffected by shear flow in the edge)\n- Prevent neoclassical tearing modes\n(eliminate seed island, limit island growth)\n\nWhat about the spherical\ntokamak (ST)?\n- The ST is an ultra-\ntight aspect ratio\ntokamak\n- ε = a/R0 →1\n- Capable of high beta\nsince βcrit ∝a/R0\nSource: Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.\n\nBut\n-\np ∝β (Bmax)2 (1-ε)2\n-\nPressure is not that high\nbecause of 1/R effect\n-\nLarge I is required - tough\nbootstrap problem\n-\nCentral TF leg must be copper:\nlow Bmax (7.5T) because of\njoule losses\n\nMy not so happy conclusion\n- ST is very interesting plasma physics\nexperiment\n- The ST does not solve any of the\ndifficulties of the standard tokamak\n- The ST probably generates more new\nproblems than in the standard tokamak.\n\nThe Stellarator\n- An inherently 3-D configuration (a toroidal-\nhelix)\n- An inherently steady state device -\nresolves the current drive problem\n- No toroidal I is required - should greatly\nreduce the kink driven disruption problem\n\nAre there any problems?\n- Stellarators are much more complicated technologically\n- The magnet design in particular is complex\n- 3-D equilibrium with closed flux surfaces can be\ncalculated but with difficulty\n- 3-D stability can be calculated but also with difficulty\n- Stellarators are very flexible before they are built - many\noptions. But are inflexible once they are built\n\nThe LHD (Japan $1B)\n-\nContinuous wound superconducting coil\n-\nEngineering marvel\n-\nTechnology doesn't extrapolate well into a reactor\nDiagram of Large Helical Device (LDH) reactor\nremoved for copyright reasons.\n\nTypes of new stellarators\n- Stellarator geometries are based largely\non reducing 3-D neoclassical transport\nlosses\n- This has lead to the concept of quasi-\nsymmetry\n- Use of modular coils for reactor viability\n\nWhat is quasi symmetry?\n- It has been shown that the guiding\ncenter particle drift off a flux surface\ndepends only on |B| not B\n(\n)\n,\nf\nψ\n⋅\n=\nGC\nn V\nB\n\nThree symmetries\n- General stellarator field\n- Quasi-poloidal symmetry (W7-X): |B| ≈f ( φ, ψ)\n- Quasi-toroidal symmetry (NCSX): |B| ≈f ( θ, ψ)\n- Quasi-helical symmetry (HSX): |B| ≈f ( Mθ + Nφ, ψ)\n(\n)\n, ( )exp\nm n\nR\nB\nr\ni m\nn\nR\nφ\nθ\nφ\n⎡\n⎤\n=\n+\n+\n⎣\n⎦\n∑\nB\ne\nb\n\nW7-X (Germany $1B)\n-\nModular superconducting coil for reactor viability\n-\nVery low bootstrap current\n-\nLarge aspect ratio: R0/a = 10\nCourtesy Max-Planck-Institut fur Plasmaphysik.
