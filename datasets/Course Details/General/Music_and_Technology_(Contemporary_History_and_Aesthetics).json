      "content": "Anonymous MIT student\nProfessor Ariza\n21M.380\n29 October 2009\nFrom Physical Law to Artistic Expression: An Analysis of the Theremin\nI. Introduction to the Theremin\nThe Theremin (or Thereminovox) is a continuously sounding, monophonic instrument\ncontrolled by moving one's hands through free space in proximity to two antennae - one that\ncontrols the frequency of the generated sound and another that controls its amplitude. It is one of\nthe few instruments that receives input from the musician without requiring any physical contact.\nSuch an instrument offers considerably different potential for artistic expression than any of the\ncommonly played acoustic instruments, but also presents a set of unique difficulties to the\nmusician making it as challenging to master as the violin or the cello. Whereas acoustic\ninstruments rely on the mechanical manipulation of oscillatory phenomena (plucking strings,\nvibrating reeds, etc.), the Theremin electrically manipulates an oscillatory phenomenon known as\nheterodyning to produce its unique sound.\nIn the case of string instruments, the musician adjusts the position of his fingers on the\nfinger board to change the apparent length of the strings, which determines the natural frequency\nat which they will resonate when plucked (or bowed). In the case of the Theremin, the musician\nadjusts the position of his fingers in free space to change the apparent capacitance of the\nfrequency sense antenna, which determines the natural frequency at which an LC oscillator will\n\nresonate. While the violinist changes the natural frequency of a mechanical oscillator by\nadjusting the position of his fingers in one dimension, the Thereminist changes the natural\nfrequency of an electrical oscillator by adjusting the position of his fingers in three dimensions.\nBoth instruments offer the ability to produce a continuous range of frequencies, as opposed to\nbrass instruments that offer only discrete frequency control. In more ways than one, the\nTheremin is analogous to the violin, and is capable of performing the same musical role in an\nensemble. However, although the Theremin is analogous to the violin in terms of input and\noutput, no acoustic instrument shares the same physical principles of operation with the\nTheremin and hence no acoustic instrument can offer its unique musical capabilities.\nThe Theremin is a remarkable innovation in both electronics and music, and unlike the\nviolin its design did not evolve over centuries eventually resulting in its present day form. The\nTheremin is the product of a single electrical engineer, Lev Sergeyevich Termin, known in the\nUnited States as Leon Theremin. Theremin's engineering expertise in RF electronics led him to\ndevelop the instrument as well as several others, each with unique properties and musical\ncapabilities. This study aims to trace the historical trajectory of the Theremin, beginning with its\ninventor and ending with its virtuosos. In doing so, the progression from physical law to musical\nexpression will be described in detail.\nAnother aim of this study is to explain how Theremin designed the electronics of the\ninstrument from a theoretical perspective for specific sonic capabilities, and how musicians\neventually came to manipulate these sonic capabilities from a musical perspective by\nunderstanding the Theremin as an instrument as opposed to an electronic circuit. This analysis\nwill attempt to bridge the gap between the science and the art of manipulating sonic systems.\n\nSection II of this paper will examine the life of Leon Theremin and the motivations for his\ninventions. Section III will go into considerable technical detail about the electronics of the\nTheremin and summarize the physical principles on which it operates. Finally, section IV will\ncharacterize the use of the Theremin by its most famous virtuosa, and how from an artistic\nperspective she interpreted the device that Leon Theremin devised from a theoretical perspective.\nSection V will draw conclusions.\nII. The Career and Inventions of Leon Theremin\nLeon Theremin was born in 1896 in the city of St. Petersburg, Russia. During his youth,\nLeon Theremin took a particular interest in physics, electricity, and oscillatory motions such as\nthat of the pendulum1. During high school, Theremin studied cello at the St. Petersburg\nConservatory of Music and graduated as \"free artist on the violoncello\". After high school,\nTheremin studied physics and astronomy at the University of St. Petersburg, and eventually also\nreceived training as an electrical engineer during his Russian military service in World War I.\nFollowing the Bolshevik revolution, a surge of academic energy permeated the Soviet\nUnion. Scientists, engineers, and students of all fields were heavily encouraged to conduct\nresearch and experimentation in new and ground-breaking subjects. The Soviets hoped to usher\nin a new era of discovery to accompany their newly created \"egalitarian\" society. Part of this\neffort involved the founding of the Institute of Physical Engineering in St. Petersburg, by Abram\nFedorovich Ioffe, a Soviet physicist who went on to win the Stalin Prize in 1942.\nAfter the war, Theremin received an invitation to begin working at the Institute of\nPhysical Engineering. Ioffe intended for Theremin to work in the field of high frequency\n1 \"Leon Theremin: Pulling Music Out of Thin Air\", by Olivia Mattis and Robert Moog,\nKeyboard, February, 1992, pp.46-54.\n\nelectrical oscillators. Theremin proceeded to work with contemporary radios and study the effect\nof body position on radio signals2. The original application for Theremin's research was a\nsecurity system that involved sensing the presence of humans by detecting fluctuations in radio\nsignals. In 1920, Theremin extended the idea of detecting humans based on signal fluctuations to\ncreating signal fluctuations that were controllable by body position. In a certain sense,\nTheremin's idea for a musical instrument was that a human could \"play\" the detector by\nadjusting body position to create a controllable signal in the audio range.\nAn important question that arises naturally at this point in the timeline is what motivation\nwould Theremin have for applying the basis for his security device as the basis for a musical\ninstrument - a seemingly completely unrelated technology. Conveniently, Theremin answered\nexactly this question in his 1991 interview with Olivia Mattis and Robert Moog. When asked,\n\"Why did you make this instrument,\" Theremin replied,\n\"I became interested in bringing about progress in music, so that there would be more\nmusical resources. I was not satisfied with the mechanical instruments in existence, of\nwhich there were many. They were all built using elementary principles and were not\nphysically well done. I was interested in making a different kind of instrument. And I\nwanted, of course, to make an apparatus that would be controlled in space, exploiting\nelectrical fields, and that would use little energy.\"3\n2 \"Musical Applications of Electric Field Sensing\", by Joseph A. Paradiso and Neil Gershenfeld,\nComputer Music Journal, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 69-89.\n3 \"Leon Theremin: Pulling Music Out of Thin Air\", by Olivia Mattis and Robert Moog,\nKeyboard, February, 1992, pp. 46-54.\n\nAt the beginning of the Bolshevik era, engineers were racing to find new and exciting uses for\nelectricity. Theremin's goal was to harness the power of electricity to eliminate the need for\nmechanical work in operating an instrument. Theremin intended to build an instrument that\nrequired very little energy to operate but could produce sounds that varied widely in amplitude\nand pitch. In this sense, the Theremin is also analogous to the baton a conductor uses to conduct\nan orchestra. Simple swift hand motions are all that is necessary to control an audio signal with\nconsiderable power. The power is introduced into the audio signal via electronic amplification, as\nopposed to the manner in which musicians of acoustic instruments generate powerful sounds by\nmeans of mechanical work. Theremin's attitude toward bringing about the opportunity for\nmusical change reflects the general attitude toward radical innovation in the beginning of the\nBolshevik era. Part of the reason for Theremin's striking success with his instrument was that this\nattitude was shared among scientists and political figures alike.\nTheremin first showcased his instrument at an electronics conference in Moscow, where\nit was received with great enthusiasm by his fellow engineers and inventors. The instrument\ngained so much popularity and publicity at the conference that once Vladimir Lenin learned of its\nexistence, he requested that Leon Theremin give him a personal demonstration of this new and\nground-breaking musical apparatus. To demonstrate the musical potential of the instrument,\nTheremin played \"The Lark\" by Glinka's during his visit with Lenin. Lenin enjoyed the selection\nso much that after the applause subsided, he asked Theremin to show him to play the instrument\nhimself.\nThe Theremin was not the only electronic instrument that Leon Theremin devised during\nhis career. He also designed an electronic cello that Edgard Varese (one of the first composers to\n\npioneer electronic music) included parts for in his 1934 composition Ecuatorial. Theremin's cello\nwas controlled by making contact between the musician's fingers and the fingerboard. So long as\na finger was depressed, a tone was generated with frequency dependent on the position of the\nfinger. In addition to the electronic cello, Theremin also designed a machine called the\nRhythmicon - a precursor to the modern sequencer and drum machine. The Rhythmicon\nproduced one fundamental pitch and gave the musician the ability to control which of its\nharmonics were also played. Each harmonic was played as a sequence of repeating tones, with\nthe repetition rate dependent on the number of the harmonic. By selecting combinations of\nharmonics, the musician could generate complex rhythmic patterns electronically - another\nradically new \"musical resource\" that Leon Theremin designed.\nLastly, Theremin designed an instrument called the Terpsitone. The Terpsitone was a\nplatform on which a dancer moved in space to control the pitch and amplitude of a generated\nsound. Like the Theremin, the properties of the generated sound depended on the effect of the\nposition of the human body on an electric field; however, the Terpsitone required full body\nmovements as opposed to small hand gestures. It effectively converted the motions of a dance\ninto sound. The dancer would raise or lower his arms to control the pitch of the sound, while\nmoving forward or backward to control the amplitude.\nIII. The Design and Operation of the Theremin\nTheremin's space-controlled instruments gave the musician the ability to control sound\nthrough a completely novel interface that relied on the exploitation of physical principles to\noperate. The method by which the motion of the musician's hands control the Theremin's sound\nwithout physical contact is known as capacitive sensing, and is the same zero-contact detection\n\nmechanism by which Theremin's security device worked. The basis for capacitive sensing is that\nthe position of the human body relative to an antenna changes the capacitance of the antenna.\nThe antenna is connected to a circuit in which its capacitance determines the resonant\nfrequency of an inductor-capacitor (LC) oscillator. Changing the antenna's capacitance changes\nthe frequency at which the LC circuit oscillates, and this is the basis for controlling sound.\nHowever, as we will soon see, the Theremin's audio output signal is not taken directly from the\nbody position controlled LC oscillator. The fluctuations in antenna capacitance due to changes in\nbody position are extremely minute, and thus it is necessary to combine the LC oscillator\naccompanying electronics to turn the small frequency fluctuations into audible ones. The signal\nprocessing technique that Theremin implemented to accomplish this task is called heterodyning,\nand we will examine it in detail after first describing the physics of how body position\ndetermines the antenna capacitance.\nThe capacitance of a cylindrical antenna in isolation (with no human present) is given by\nthe following expression4:\nCa (inf) =\n2œÄŒµ0h\nlog(2h ) - k\nd\nin which h is the antenna height, d is the antenna diameter, k is a constant depending on high the\nantenna is positioned above the ground, and …õ0 is the permittivity of free space (8.854 picofarads\nper meter). The expression effectively tells us the capacitance of the antenna when the hand is\n4 \"Physics of the Theremin\", by Kenneth D. Skeldon and Lindsay M. Reid, American Journal of\nPhysics, Volume 66, Issue 11, pp. 945-955 (1998).\n\nnot present, or infinitely far away. The change in the antenna's capacitance that results from the\nhand being positioned at distance x from the antenna is given by5:\nŒîCa (x) =\nœÄŒµ0h\n10log(4x )\nd\nThe total capacitance of the antenna with the hand positioned at distance x is:\nCa (x) = Ca (inf) + ŒîCa (x)\nNow that we have a formula for the antenna's capacitance as a function of hand position, we may\nexamine LC oscillator network that surrounds it to determine how the oscillator's resonant\nfrequency fluctuates depending on the antenna's capacitance, and hence on the position of the\nmusician's hand.\nFigure 1: Oscillator circuit with output frequency dependent on antenna capacitance.6\n(c) American Institute of Physics.

Reid, American Journal of\nPhysics, Volume 66, Issue 11, pp. 945-955 (1998).\n\nThe resonant frequency of the LC oscillator seen on the left-hand side of the schematic for the\nColpitts oscillator circuit is given by7:\n2œÄ L\n‚éõ 1\n1 ‚éû\n1/2\nf0 =\n‚éù‚éú C1\n+ C2 ‚é†‚éü\nin which C1 is the value of the capacitor C1 as shown in the schematic and C2 is the parallel\ncapacitance of the capacitor C (as shown), any stray capacitance between the antenna and\nthe rest of the circuit (Cs), and the antenna capacitance (CA). It seems reasonable to assume\nthat the output of the Colpitts oscillator could be used as the audio output of the Theremin, since\nthe frequency of this signal can be manipulated by hand position. However, due to the\nmathematical relation between hand position and resonant frequency, large variations in hand\nposition lead to very small variations in the output signal of the Colpitts oscillator. Theremin\nimplemented a technique called heterodyning to transform the small fluctuations in the frequency\nof the Colpitts oscillator to large fluctuations in the frequency of an audible output signal.\nThe concept of heterodyning was first applied to the design of a musical instrument in\n1915 by Lee DeForest in his invention of the Audion Piano8. The basis for heterodyning is that\nwhen two sinusoidal signals are mixed, the output signal has two frequency components equal to\nthe sum and the difference of the input signals. In signal processing, the mixing operation\n7 \"Physics of the Theremin\", by Kenneth D. Skeldon and Lindsay M. Reid, American Journal of\nPhysics, Volume 66, Issue 11, pp. 945-955 (1998).\n8 \"Electronic and Experimental Music: Technology, Music and Culture\", by Thom Holmes. New\nYork: Scribner, 2008.\n\ncorresponds to multiplying two signals. We can verify the output of the mixing operation with a\nsimple trigonometric identity9:\nVout = Vin,1 √ó Vin,2 = A1sin(œâ1t) √ó A2 sin(œâ2t)\nVout\nA1\nA2 (cos((œâ1 -œâ2)t) - cos((œâ1 + œâ2)t))\n=\nWe can eliminate the frequency component equal to the sum of the two frequencies easily by\ncascading the mixer with a low-pass filter, outputting a waveform with frequency equal to the\ndifference of the two input frequencies, called the \"beat\" frequency. By pairing two high-\nfrequency Colpitts oscillators together, one oscillating at a fixed frequency and one with a\nfrequency fluctuating due to changes in antenna capacitance, and applying the necessary\nheterodyning circuitry to their outputs, Leon Theremin was able to transform minute fluctuates in\nantenna capacitance into large fluctuations in the audible beat frequency of the two oscillators.\nRecall that changes in antenna capacitance are small, and hence they produce very small\nfluctuations in the output frequency of the antenna dependent Colpitts oscillator. If the antenna\ndependent Colpitts oscillator rings nominally at 1 MHz, a small change in antenna capacitance\nmight have the effect of changing its frequency by 1 kHz (a 0.1% fluctuation)10. However,\nassuming that the fixed oscillator also rings at 1 MHz, the difference of the two signals would be\n1 kHz - an audible signal. In order for the beat frequency to sweep the entire audible frequency\nrange (20 Hz to 2 kHz), the nominally 1 MHz frequency would need to fluctuate by at most\n0.2%. A musician moving his hand in close proximity to the antenna is certainly capable of\n9 \"Physics of the Theremin\", by Kenneth D. Skeldon and Lindsay M. Reid, American Journal of\nPhysics, Volume 66, Issue 11, pp. 945-955 (1998).\n10 \"Physics of the Theremin\", by Kenneth D. Skeldon and Lindsay M. Reid, American Journal of\nPhysics, Volume 66, Issue 11, pp. 945-955 (1998).\n\nproducing this fluctuation by means of changing the antenna capacitance. In an actual Theremin,\nthe antenna-dependent Colpitts oscillator would be configured to ring at the same frequency as\nthe fixed oscillator when the antenna capacitance was set to Ca(inf), effectively producing a beat\nfrequency of 0 Hz (no sound) when the operator's hand was far enough away from the antenna.\nAs the operator moved his hand closer, the antenna capacitance would change, causing greater\nand greater fluctuations in the antenna-dependent oscillator frequency, which caused the beat\nfrequency of the two oscillators to increase through the audible range.\nTheremin also included another heterodyned oscillator pair for the purpose of volume\ncontrol. The beat frequency of the two oscillators was controlled in exactly the same manner as\nthat of the pitch oscillators (antenna capacitance); however, the beat frequency instead of being\nused as an audio output was passed through a band-pass filter. As the musician moved his hand\nin close proximity to the volume antenna to change the beat frequency of the volume oscillators,\nhe effectively tuned the beat frequency into the pass-band of the filter11. The filter's output was\nthen applied to an envelope follower and used as the control voltage for a voltage controlled\namplifier (VCA) that amplified the audio output of the Theremin (the beat frequency of the pitch\noscillators). In this manner, a certain range of hand positions would maximize the amplitude of\nthe band-pass filter's output, and hence the control voltage of the VCA, in effect maximizing the\nvolume of the Theremin's audio output. Overall, the Theremin required moving two hands in\nproximity to two antennae, one for pitch and one for volume. Theremin engineered the\ninstrument to allow for smooth, continuous control over pitch and similarly a wide range of\ncontrol over dynamics. The virtuosos of the Theremin, provided with this engineered space\n11 \"Musical Applications of Electric Field Sensing\", by Joseph A. Paradiso and Neil Gershenfeld,\nComputer Music Journal, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 69-89.\n\ncontrolled interface, were able to develop an intuition for understanding its subtleties and learned\nhow to skillfully manipulate its sound.\nIV. Clara Rockmore\nOne of the most famous Thereminists of the 20th century was Clara Rockmore, a\nclassically trained violinist who was accepted as the youngest ever violin student at the St.\nPetersburg Imperial Conservatory at the age of four12. In 1977, Robert Moog gave Rockmore an\ninterview to be published at the same time as her newest record, The Art of the Theremin. In this\ninterview she explained how she manipulated the Theremin as a musical instrument, as opposed\nto a merely sound-generating electronic circuit. When asked to explain the musical limitations of\nthe Theremin, Rockmore replied:\n\"The violin has four strings, which makes a big difference. What I do on the theremin is\nthe same as a cellist would do if he had one string. It's that much more difficult. For\ninstance, there is a very easy Handel violin sonata where you play rapidly from string to\nsting. It's very difficult on a theremin, because you have to use time to go the distance ... I\nadopted the violin vibrato for the theremin, but it's with the other hand. I try to emulate\nthe violin bowing technique with my left hand. Since the theremin tone is constant, I have\nto artificially create a 'breath'.\"13\nAlthough the Theremin circuitry gives the musician only the simple facility to control the\nvolume and pitch of the generated sound, Rockmore developed techniques to emulate the sound\n12 \"The World of Women in Classical Music\", by Dr. Anne K. Gray. San Diego: WordWorld\nPublications, 2007. http://www.nadiareisenberg-clararockmore.org/clara_biography.htm\n13 \"In Clara's Words\", by Robert Moog. October 27, 2002. http://www.thereminvox.com/article/\narticleview/21/1/22/\n\nof the violin by skillfully combining the two interface controls simultaneously. When asked what\nthe unique advantages of the Theremin were, Rockmore answered:\n\"...Very fine violinists have a long bow. But as long as their bow may be, mine is longer.\nYou have a musical nuance right there. A singer may have to take breaths even when it's\nnot musically desirable, because he cannot continue to sing. I take the breaths when I\nthink it's musically valid or necessary. I create a breath. I do it deliberately. I never\ndo it because it's necessary. I can choose when I take it so it suits the music.\"14\nIt is clear that because of her extensive experience with the violin, Rockmore interpreted in terms\nof its relationship to the violin and relative capabilities. Rockmore explained that she uses her\nTheremin techniques (\"bowing\", \"breathing\", and vibrato) to liken the sound of the Theremin to\nthat of a common instrument. However, the same features (continuously sounding tone,\ncontinuous pitch and volume) of the Theremin that require the musician to use special techniques\nto shape its sound into something musical are the features that give the Theremin the capability\nto exceed the performance of a common instrument. Rockmore remarked that with the Theremin,\nshe has absolute control over when (or never) to breath.\nOne of Rockmore's most significant comments involves her interpretation of the\nTheremin as a musical interface:\n\"There are certain nuances and qualities that you can obtain because you don't have\nanything in your hand. It really comes out of the air. That's why Prof. Theremin called it\n14 \"In Clara's Words\", by Robert Moog. October 27, 2002. http://www.thereminvox.com/article/\narticleview/21/1/22/\n\nthe Ether Wave Instrument. There is a certain terrific freedom. You feel like a conductor\nin front of an orchestra. There is no instrument between you and the music.\"15\nThis quotation proves Leon Theremin's success as the engineer of the instrument. His original\ndesign goal was to empower the musician with extensive freedom over the produced sound by\neliminating the need for the expenditure of mechanical energy. In his 1991 interview with Robert\nMoog, Theremin remarked, \"I conceived of an instrument that would create sound without using\nmechanical energy, like the conductor of an orchestra.\"16 And this is exactly the freedom that\nClara Rockmore harnessed to become the leading virtuosa of the Theremin in her time.\nV.

In the\nearly twentieth century; engineers, inventors, and tinkerers started to experiment with ways of\nusing advances in mechanics and electronics to record, enhance, and produce sound. Concrete\nexamples of this phenomenon can observed in devices such as: the Telharmonium, a device\nwhich transmitted sequences of tones over the phone lines; the phonograph and gramophone,\ndevices which mechanically transduced sounds onto cylinders and later onto discs; and the radio,\na device which transmits and receives modulated sound waveforms as electromagnetic radiation.\nOften, these new technologies emerge as means to overcome technological limitations; however,\nwith these innovations come even more problems to overcome. With the introduction of\nelectrical amplification and its application to the guitar, many interesting design issues emerged,\nwhose solutions led to the robustness of modern-day guitar technology.\nThe guitar is one of the oldest known instruments, tracing its roots back to the Oud of\nAncient Mesopotamia. How the guitar works is relatively simple: a set of strings is stretched and\ntensed over the body of the guitar. The body of the guitar consists of a hollow cavity. When one\nof these strings is plucked, the string vibrates at a certain frequency, producing sound. The cavity\nresonates and amplifies certain frequencies, producing the signature guitar sound. Other stringed\ninstruments work in a similar fashion. The cavity of the instrument and where the strings of the\ninstrument are generally plucked determines the harmonics and identifiable sound of stringed\n\ninstruments. Over the centuries, many models of the guitar have been created: materials used for\nthe base and strings have changed and there exist many variations in the number of strings\namong guitar models.\nFor most of its history, the guitar had been regarded mainly as a non-orchestral\ninstrument and had found use mainly as a solo instrument due to its low volume compared to\nother instruments. However, in the 1920s and 1930s, a paradigm shift in the purpose of the guitar\ntook place: The lap steel, a guitar-like instrument placed on the performer's lap, was used\nincreasingly in noisy clubs, where the need for amplification became evident. Additionally,\nSpanish guitarists, such as Eddie Lang and Lonnie Johnson, introduced the notion that the guitar\nbe used in orchestral performances.1 However, the guitar's potency paled in comparison to that of\nbrass or other instruments. The electrically amplified guitar emerged as a response to the need\nfor amplification.\nThe aim of this case study is to trace the emergence and development of the electric\npickup, a device which transduces vibrations in strings into electrical impulses and which is a\npivotal component of the electric guitar. In particular, this study will analyze and study the\nprogressive changes that occurred in pickup design over the decades; why certain approaches to\ndesigning pickups prevailed and others failed; what problems emerged as the designs of pickups\nincreased in sophistication; and how problems in design that were seen as hindering aspects of\nthe electric guitar, reverse salients, were transformed into positive aspects. In order to carry out\nthis analysis, however, the principles behind the operation of the pickup must first be discussed,\nin order to assess the effectiveness of each design. Therefore, this case study will be divided into\nseveral major parts: (1) a brief explanation of the physical principles behind the operation of the\npickup, (2) a summarization of how the iterations of the guitar pickup were implemented, and (3)\n1 McSwain (Braun), \"The Social Reconstruction of a Reverse Salient in Electronic Guitar Technology,\" 186-198\n\na contrast between these different designs,.\nThe Physical Principles Behind The Pickup2\nMagnetism is one of the four fundamental force of nature. Its origin lies in the fact that\ninformation cannot travel faster than the speed of light and in the fields of accelerating charges.\nThe electromagnetic fields of charges suffer \"jumps\" in the regions before and after it is known\nthat the charges accelerated. Oscillating electric charges produce sinusoidally varying\nelectromagnetic waves that propagate through space and matter.\nMagnets are the components that drive all of the major pickup designs. There are several\ntypes of magnets that are used: the permanent magnet, the ferromagnet, and the coil magnet.\nPermanent magnets produce a magnetic field because the charges in the magnet are set into a\nnearly-permanent, complementary oscillatory motion. The permanent magnet can be modeled as\ndipole. The ferromagnet is a temporary magnet that produces a magnetic field. Ordinarily, this\nmagnet does not exhibit a magnetic field, but is induced by a permanent magnet. Its magnetic\nfield can also be modeled as a dipole. The coil magnet is merely a coil through which alternating\ncurrent flows, which induces a magnetic field according orientation of the winding of the coil,\namong several other factors.\nAnother pivotal component of most pickup designs is the use of coils in order to \"pickup\"\nchanges in the magnetic field. Utilizing induction is the most common way of picking up\nvibrations of the strings and transducing them, because it is passive and fairly accurate. Induction\noperates on the following physical principles: A varying magnetic field induces an electromotive\nforce in a loop of wire that counters that change. This electromotive force manifests itself as a\nPurcell, E. M. (1985). \"Electricity and Magnetism: Berkeley Physics Course, Volume 2\". Published by\nMcGraw-Hill.\n\nvoltage difference. This voltage difference is equal to the change in flux times a constant of\ninduction, which is linearly proportional to the number of windings that compose the loop. Thus,\na sinusoidally varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force in the coil that is nearly\nperfectly sinusoidal, and by the principle of superposition, any varying signal or repeating\nwaveform induces an equivalent electromotive force in the coil. This voltage can then be\namplified and modulated as desired.\nA Survey of Different Pickup Designs\nThe first American, patented attempt at producing a pickup was performed by W. D.\nSmith in 1927.3 This pickup was intended to be used to transduce any sound; it is a precursor of\nthe microphone. The device operates as follows: A \"magnetic member\" is gently held between\nthe two ends of a horseshoe magnet. A coil is wound at the base of the horseshoe, with many\nturnings. The magnetic member is held in such a way that any fluctuations in the pressure of the\nair cause the member to move, inducing changes in the magnetic field which are then translated\ninto electromotive forces in the coil. This approach represents an important milestone because it\nforms the basis for many of the later iterations of the guitar pickup. Its design, however, was\nflawed in what it was intended to do because it registered sounds from any direction, except\nthose parallel to the member, and interference from unwanted sources would be nearly\nimpossible to prevent. It lacked portability and always needed to be held upright and stationary,\nfunctions which musicians take for granted with today's microphones.\nThe first patented pickup for the guitar, used in the famous \"Frying Pan\" guitar, was that\nof George Beauchamp, who attempted to patent his design in 1932 but was issued the patent in\n3 Smith, W.D. (Issued: 1930.) Electrical Pickup. Obtained at http://www.google.com/patents?id=x4xWAAAAEBAJ.\n\n1937.4 His design, also known as the \"horseshoe pickup,\" is recognized as the unofficial first\nguitar pickup and was used as the basis for successive iterations of pickup design. His design\nconsists of a pair of U-shaped magnets, which are attached to a supporting plate and\nencompassed the strings. The poles of the magnets face each other and are sandwiched in the\ncavity form by the magnets. A single coil picks up the electromagnetic variations induced by the\nstrings.\nA few years later, A. J. Stimson filed a patent in 1934 for another pickup design. This\ndesign uses less materials than Beauchamp's. The pickup operates as follows: Below the strings\nlies a horseshoe magnet and above it are attached windings. When the guitar strings are agitated,\nthe change in the magnetic field caused by the movement of the string induces an electromotive\nforce in the coils, which translates to a voltage waveform in direct correlation to the movement\nof the string.5\nOnly a year later, Arnold Lesti filed for a patent for similar design to that of Stimson's.\nHis implementation sought to provide amplification for \"instruments which are not sufficiently\nloud when played in the normal manner\", by translating string vibrations into electrical impulses;\nto reproduce faithfully the tones of the instrument, without the interference of the acoustics of the\ninstrument; to provide a means by which to adjust the intensity of treble and bass, by adjusting\nthe intensity of the DC current used to magnetize each string and by adjusting the relative\ndistance of each solenoid to its corresponding string; and to magnetize the strings in the most\nefficient manner. The design operates as follows: Several coils are placed below the steel strings.\nA DC voltage is applied for a short amount of time prior to performance in order to magnetize\nthe strings. The coils are powered off and during the playing of the instrument, changes in\n4 Beauchamp, G. D. (Filed 1932). \"Electrical Stringed Musical Instrument\".

However, DC voltage was regarded as highly dangerous and this design was\nnever widely adopted.\nSubsequent patents were very similar but differed and built on several aspects of the\naforementioned designs. Delbert J. Dickerson's 1938 patent changes a few aspects of the guitar.\nThose of interest are the following: a horseshoe magnet is placed below the strings; a wound coil\nis placed sideways between two plates; and above the strings a metal plate is placed. Volume\ncontrol was featured on the guitar. The plate above the strings is a radical addition: it supposedly\nincreased volume and tone quality.7\nSoon thereafter Gibson, Inc.'s engineers started to file patents of designs of electrical\npickups. In 1936, Gibson inventor Guy Hart filed for patent of an \"Electrical Musical\nInstrument,\" widely regarded as the first true electric guitar, the direct predecessor of modern\nelectric guitars.8 Its chassis is solid, composed of wood or metal, so as to reduce the effects of\nresonance. The pickup device he patented consists of the following: A pair of magnets rest on a\nsupport plate whose distance from the strings can be adjusted. \"Magnetic legs\" protrude a set of\ncoils, which pickup the vibrations through induction. The pickup is embedded into the guitar and\nwas held there by a screw, which is adjustable. Though a bit crude, Hart's design formed the\nbasis upon which subsequent guitar designs would be built.\nIn 1938, Gibson inventor George R. Miller filed a patent which sought to improve many\n6 Lesti, A. (Issued: 1936.) Electric Translating Device for Musical Instruments.

These six\nscrews can be moved up and down in order to adjust the amplitudes of each string. This design is\nquite similar to Lesti's, but uses a permanent magnet instead of magnetizing the wires prior to\nperformances.\nIn 1941, another Gibson engineer, Clarence W. Russell, filed a patent which sought to\neliminate tone distortion and equalize tone volume. His invention consists of a horseshoe magnet\nto which is attached a plate which is screwed into the magnet. On this plate, oriented in the\ndirection of the magnetic field between the two poles is a set of holes, which house coils, through\nwhich the strings of the guitar pass and which are affected evenly no matter the directions in\nwhich the string is oscillated. The sizes of the wholes vary depending on the diameter and make\nof the string.\nIn 1946, the Gibson P90 guitar pickup was patented, which is a standard still used to this\nday in single-coil guitars.10 The P90 operates as follows: One large flat coil is used as the\ninductor which transduces the vibrations. Below each string is an adjustable steel screw which\nacts as a pole piece. Two flat AlNiCo bar magnets lie under the coil. This design produced a rich\ntreble sound and would become the pickup of choice for many musicians.\nDespite all of the changes and variations introduced in the preceding patents, regular,\nsingle-coil pickups suffered from what many consider to be a major flaw: the coils would pick up\na hum from the alternating current supplying the power to the devices. This phenomenon\n9 Miller, G. R. (Issued: 1939.) Magnetic Pick-up for Musical Instruments. Obtained from\nhttp://www.google.com/patents?id=Ry0CAAAAEBAJ.\n10 Hart, G. (Filed 1936). \"Electrical Musical Instrument\". Obtained from: http://www.google.com/patents?\nid=e7hGAAAAEBAJ\n\nhappens because of another fundamental property of electromagnetism: currents induce magnetic\nfields; and most equipment is powered by alternating current power sources. Thus, a detectable\nlow-frequency (about 50 to 60 Hz) hum is audible with the use of single-coil pickups. This\nreverse salient would remained unsolved until, in 1957, a Gibson engineer, Seth Lover, patented\na novel approach, still used to this day, to eliminate the hum.\nThe hum-eliminating pickup (pictured above, from the original patent), later to be known\nas the Humbucker, is composed of two sets of windings, located next to each other and under the\nguitar strings. Both coils are perturbed by plucked strings; however, both have opposite polarities\nand winding directions. The plucking of the string is amplified by this arrangement, but\nbackground interference, from lights or from AC sources, induces canceling electromotive\nforces. The net result is that barely no interference affects the sound of the guitar and that the\ntones of the guitar get amplified, providing purer sound.11\n11 Lover, Seth. E. (Issued: 1959). MAGNETIC PICKUP FOR STRINGED MUSICAL INSTRUMENT. Obtained\nfrom http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2896491.\n\nA Contrast Between the Different Pickup Designs\nThe iterations of the pickup do not differ much from each other, for they operate using the\nsame physical principles. Single-coil pickup design has not changed much since the 1940s. The\nmanner in which the pickups most differ is in how they were assembled and in how they were\npositioned. The most popular pickup designs are the P90 and the Humbucker, which triumphed\nover many of the proposed alternate designs. The reasons for which these pickups were favored\nand other were abandoned will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.\nBeauchamp's \"horseshoe\" pickup triumphed early in the 1930s due to its success on the\nlap steel guitar. However, it failed to gain acceptance as a pickup in standard electric guitars,\nparticularly because the magnets which circle the strings were hard to set up, could dislodge,\nposed a hazard because were located above the strings and could cling to foreign objects and\nbecause its coils were exposed to other forms of radiation, including light, which produced a\nsignificant hum.\nArnold Lesti's design, which sought to correct many of the problems encountered with\nprevious single-coil designs and which was quite advanced for its time, never gained much use.\nOne main reason for which it was not accepted was the fact that it used DC voltage to magnetize\nthe strings, which presents a set of serious problems: (1) Lesti's design did not use magnets and\nrelied on DC voltage to magnetize the strings prior to every performance. This approach does not\nguarantee that each string will be magnetized equally, magnetizing more the inner strings. (2)\nThe magnetized strings did not induce voltages as strongly as they would with permanent\nmagnets, as the flux induced by permanent magnets is much greater. (3) DC voltages are\nconsidered extremely dangerous, as any short or any nearby metals greatly increased the risk of\nshocking those around the guitar, potentially injuring those who are around the guitar while it is\n\ncharging. (4) The magnetization of the strings would dwindle over time. Mid-performance, it is\nextremely inconvenient to be forced to stop and remagnetize the strings. His idea of being able to\nadjust the intensity of the treble and bass is echoed throughout the designs of future pickups,\nsuch as the widely used P90 and Fender pickup models.\nDickerson's approach is similar to Beauchamp's in that it also covers the strings. The plate\nabove the strings greatly limited this design's potential for adoption. Though his patent never saw\nmuch use, one idea of his guitar design is also seen in future patent designs: volume control.\nModern guitars feature knobs that are used to adjust tone and volume, that are very similar to\nthose proposed by Dickerson in the 1930s.\nHart's guitar design definitely had a lasting influence on the design of future guitar\nchasee. However, his approach to incorporating the pickup was not very practical: it limited the\npotential of the guitar by embedding it into the chassis. Removing it or replacing it would be a\nhassle to the guitarist and limits the choice of pickup to those that would be compatible with the\ndimensions of the guitar.\nClarence Russell's design suffered from many of the flaws of Beauchamp's. His threaded\npickup design is flawed because it can interfere with the vibrations of the strings itself were they\nto be plucked to forcefully. Additionally, removing or replacing the pickup would be\ninconvenient, as each string would have to be threaded through each individual hole.\nThe P90, along with the Fender single-coil pickups, is the most widely used single-coil\npickup to date. Its success can be attributed to the following factors: (1) a robust design which\ncaptures the vibrations effectively; (2) a simple compartmental design that makes replacement\nand installation an easy task; (3) amplitude adjustment for each individual string; (4) effective\nmarketing strategies carried out by Gibson; (5) widespread celebrity use by famous guitarists; (6)\n\na distinct sound only attainable with this pickup; and (7) increased durability and ease of\ntransportation, as its casing made the pickup much more robust than its earlier counterparts;\namong many other factors.\nThere is no doubt as to why the Humbucker has been so successful since its inception: the\nhum produced by single-coil pickups was widely regarded as a reverse salient in electric guitar\ntechnology. Borrowing many of its aesthetic and functional aspects from the P90, the\nHumbucker resolved the problem of the hum and produced a unique, terser sound, as well.\nProduced by Gibson and marketed extremely well, use of the Humbucker caught like wildfire\nand quickly and nearly completely replaced the use of single-coil pickup models. The single-coil\npickup still saw use because the humbucker produced a unique sound called the \"humbucker\ntone\" and because the guitar had different resonance frequencies, which produced a less treble\ntone. In fact, several musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix, embraced the single-coil pickup's faults in\norder to experiment and produce unique music.12\nConclusion\nIn the development of the guitar pickup, a tendency towards exploiting new\ndevelopments in technology is observable. The pickup developed from Smith's humble, fragile,\nineffective omnidirectional pickup to a robust, compact element that easily amplifis a guitar's\nsound. The development of the pickup mirrored other changes in electric guitar design: namely, a\ndesires for increased amplification, the possibility of signal processing before outputting signals,\nand a desire to decrease the influence of body resonance on the output of sound. The reasons as\nto why the P90 and the Humbucker trumped other pickup can be summarized as follows: better\nmarketing, compactness, effectiveness, and convenience. The simplicity of both models allowed\n12 McSwain (Braun), \"The Social Reconstruction of a Reverse Salient in Electronic Guitar Technology,\" 186-198\n\nmusicians to experiment and create their own unique sounds.

(Death of Autotune)\" - Jay-Z1\nWhen strong lyrics are released in order to challenge a means of modifying music, one can\nbe certain that technology in question has had a prominent effect on those who use and listen to it.\nWith that said, auto-tune has become extensively intertwined in the present music scene of the\ncurrent youth generation. In one sense, it is used craftily behind the scenes to \"perfect\" performers'\nvoices while maintaining a semi-natural timbre. Concurrently, auto-tune has also been employed in\nextremely audible contexts, especially within the pop, hip-hop, and R&B genres of popular music. In\nfact, the top five songs from every weekly Billboard Hot 100 list over the past year include songs\nthat have implemented auto-tune as a clear, primary feature (see attached table).2 Without much\ndetective work, one can assess that auto-tune technology has made its presence as an extension to\nsound alteration very apparent.\nConversely, what still remains unclear is the period in which auto-tune will remain relevant\nwithin today's popular culture. The electronic modification of music has existed for years in many\nforms (effects pedals, modular synthesis, etc.) within multiple genres including country, classic rock,\nblues, and others. However, very few technologies have had cultural impacts that last and continue\nto be significant within the constant evolution of music development. Auto-tune appears to have\n1Carter, Shawn \"Jay-Z\", \"D.O.A.

Though, with the insurgence of artists and supporters fueling a growing \"anti\nauto-tune\" coalition, it may seem that the magic of auto-tune may be on its way out.\nAuto-Tune History and Development\nThe framework behind auto-tune was developed by Dr. Harold (Andy) Hildebrand during\nhis time working as a research scientist for Exxon Production Research and Landmark Graphics.3\nOriginally, Dr. Hildebrand developed a technique to map the Earth's subsurface in the search for\nrich oil deposits using signal processing and autocorrelation. Carefully placed dynamite charges\nwould send sound waves into the crust, and the reflections from the waves' interceptions would be\nrecorded and interpreted to create images of layer structure and deposits.4\nAfter leaving Exxon and returning to study music in 1989, Dr. Hildebrand founded Antares\nAudio Technologies and applied his seismic imaging techniques to problems found in musical digital\nsignal processing (DSP). Using a similar form of autocorrelation, Hildebrand explored the\npossibilities of treating desirable pitches much like the hidden oil reserves in the crust. Using the\ninput of sound (human voice) like the charges, Hildebrand was able to develop a software that\n\"automatically tuned\" to the nearest acceptable pitch given constraints such as key or mode. Thus,\nAuto-tune was born and first made available in 1997. Released as both software and hardware, audio\nengineers could purchase and install a plug-in or get the rack mount known as the ATR-1.\nThe technology for auto-tuning differs from both of its similar predecessors: the talk box\nand the vocoder. A talk box is an effect pedal that contains a strong speaker and an airtight plastic\n3 Antares History. 2009. 29 October 2009 <http://www.antarestech.com/about/history.shtml>.\n4 Frere-Jones, Sasha. \"The Gerbil's Revenge.\" The New Yorker 9 June 2008.\nDiaz 2\n\ntube that runs from the pedal to the singer's mouth.5 Though there is some dispute to the actual\ncreator of the talk box, Bob Heil is generally accepted as being the first one to make a modern\nprototype. 6 Peter Frampton received one from Heil as a Christmas gift in the 1970's. After using it\nin performance, the talk box's modern popularity began to skyrocket.\nA vocoder is a synthesis system in which speech is passed through a multiband filter. The\nfilters then are affixed to carrier envelopes, and a decoder applies the control signals (desired\npitches) to the corresponding filters during re-synthesis. Put simply, speech is modulated with\ninstrument pitches acting as carriers, creating an effect that takes a voice and gives it a robotic sound\nat a given pitch or chord.7 Originally, this technology was developed as a speech coder for\ntelecommunication by Homer W. Dudley during the 1930's.8 Actual musical use of the technology\nfirst took form in 1969. A man named Bruce Haack developed the FARAD, the first vocoder\ndesigned for usage in music, and it premiered on his album, The Electric Lucifer.9 However, the\nmusical vocoder became wildly popular in late 1970's. The Main Street Disneyland Electric Parade,\nwhich began in 1972, is one of the most well-known applications of vocoder technology.10\nAuto-tune is considered to be a phase vocoder. A phase vocoder differs from a standard\nvocoder in its ability to modify both frequency and time domains using algorithms that employ the\nshort-time Fourier transform (STFT).11\n5 I.

The\npurpose of this function is to \"frame\" the inner transform, shaping it into discrete granular sections\nthat can be modified individually. Using the STFT this way, the modification of frequencies can take\nplace independently without modifying the time, and vice versa. This prevents effects such as an\nincrease in tempo (velocity) when the pitch is increased, like voices of the cartoon characters, \"Alvin\nand the Chipmunks.\"\nIn the illustration above, the concept of small \"granules,\" or portions of the overall transform\ncan be visualized.\nConcealed Use of Auto-Tune in Music Production\nThough the technology has existed since 1997, auto-tune remained nearly unknown outside\nof the world of audio engineers and music production studios in its early years. Initially, its principal\nfunction was to covertly fix and alter incorrect notes in the studio without forcing the performers to\ncome in again to re-sing, saving both time and money. However, little by little, studios would offer\nmore and more extra help, e.g. assisting singers by sprucing up challenging passages to sound pitch\nDiaz 4\n(c) Artech House. All rights reserved.

Eventually, these alterations became more and more frequent until they began to approach\nthe ubiquity of a song itself.\nAs this phenomenon occurred, many artists and producers began to simultaneously question\nthe ethics of digitally engineering their voices. Those that opposed the technology believed that in\nsacrificing their natural voices to the machine, the expressiveness of the music lost some form of its\nhuman element. In a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio interview with Jian Ghomeshi\nfrom Q, NPR Music Reviewer, Tom Moon discusses the \"takeover of Autotune.\"12 When discussing\nthe producer David Foster's decision to correct a flat performance by artist Neil Young, Moon\ncomments,\n\"[T]here's a certain quality that you get from him that no one else in the world has, and the\nminute that you put him on the grid and align him, as happens with auto-tune, you're in a\ndifferent business. [S]uddenly, something that's essential about Neil Young, something about\nhis 'Neil Young-ness' is taken away.\"\nAuto-tuning also began to flourish specifically within the country genre, where performers\nvoices tend to waver in tone more frequently. Opposing this trend, many artists took pride in their\nnatural abilities. Artists such as, Martina McBride, Garth Brooks, Vince Gill, Trisha Yearwood are\nsome of the artists that refused the studios' decisions to modify their songs and producing \"auto\ntune\" free albums.13 Despite the effort by these performers, the trend of modifying the music has\nforged strongly into the recording studios for many musical icons, where auto-tuning is both\nexpected and utilized to make pop music always retain perfect pitch. A Grammy-winning recording\n12 Ghomeshi, Jian. \"The Podcast for Thursday, June 25 2009.\" 25 June 2009.

You haul out Auto-Tune to make one thing better, but then\nit's very hard to resist the temptation to spruce up the whole vocal, give everything a little nip-\ntuck.\"14\nOvert Use of Auto-Tune in Music Production\nSince 2006, the presence of obvious auto-tune usage appears to have exponentially grown.\nThe emergence of this technique is generally attributed to two artists, Cher and T-Pain.\n\"And I can't break through. There's no talking to you.\" - \"Believe\" - Cher15\nWithin the first 37 seconds of Cher's single, \"Believe,\" the world was exposed to the\ninnovative use of auto-tune in an evident way. Spending seven weeks as the number one single\naround the globe in 1998, there were not many in the music community that had not heard it.16 Two\nproducers from London, Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling, are credited with discovering what is now\nknown as the \"Cher Effect.\" The warbled end product that Cher sings was achieved by using auto-\ntune and altering the pitch correction speed. By adjusting it so that the gradual slides between each\nnote, or portamento, were reduced to nothing, instantaneous and rigid transitions between the tones\nare created, producing the synthetic effect heard in the song. However, there was some initial\ncontroversy over the technique. Taylor and Rawling originally reported that the effect was made\nusing a vocoder setting on a Korg VC10 in order to protect the producers' trade secret.17 When\n14 Tyrangiel, Josh. \"Auto-Tune: Why Pop Music Sounds Perfect.\" Time 05 February 2009.\n15 Sarkisian, Cherilyn \"Cher\". \"Believe.\" Believe.

I didn't think anybody in their right mind would use it that way.\"18\nFollowing Cher's success, other artists soon dabbled in the realm of exposed auto-tuning.\nItalian electronic dance group Eiffel 65 released their hypnotic \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\"19 in 1999.\nReaching marginal success overall in the United States, their hit reached #6 on the Billboard charts.\nSouthern rock soon followed with Kid Rock's \"Only God Knows Why\"20 (2000). Using auto-tune,\nRock was able to smooth his voices and create soothing tones that lay in stark contrast to the\nharshness that could normally be found in his tonal range [see \"Cowboy\" (1999)]. Rounding out the\npop audience, Avril Lavigne's \"Complicated\"21 (2002) uses auto-tune to round out the tones in the\nsong's verses and final outtro. It is easily seen that the secret of auto-tune had been unleashed on the\naudience. Though, despite Cher's influence, an upcoming MC from Tallahassee would continue to\npush the boundaries of auto-tune usage and forge a new sub-genre.\nBorn Faheem Rasheed Najm, T-Pain first started experimenting with auto-tuning in 2003.22\nHeavily influenced by Roger Troutman of the group Zapp and his use of the talkbox sound\nmodification, T-Pain simply experimented with auto-tuning not expecting for anyone to want to\nhear it.23 With the release of his first single \"I'm Sprung\" in 2005, he quickly grabbed the ears of the\nmusic crowd, debuting at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100.24\nMuch like Cher, T-Pain's use of auto-tune had a profound effect on the music community.\nHowever, his reach would extend far greater than \"Believe\" had in the late 1990s.

With the progression of his success, he seemed to\nhave a greater impact through the formation of a unique sub-genre of R&B and hip-hop that\nfeatured heavy electronic manipulation with an emphasis on auto-tune. Other musicians, inspired by\nthis success, began to experiment with a similar sound. Some of these other artists include Kayne\nWest, 3OH!3, Rhianna, Sean Kingston, Lil Wayne, and Drake.\nAuto-Tune Flourishes Within the Hip-Hop Community\nTrends between artists in a similar genre happen with every style of music. Most metal bands\nwear black, most country musicians sing about southern themes, and most punk bands praise\nanarchy. However, the group that tends to create and append the most trends throughout its\nnetwork of locations, crews, houses, and artists themselves is ultimately found in the overarching\nhip-hop genre. While the typical structure for trend-setting tends to start with those who are most\nsuccessful, hip-hop artists tend to derive new movements from anyone, whether they are a rookie or\na well-seasoned veteran.\nFor example, Jay-Z was new to the scene when his album, Reasonable Doubt debuted in 1996.\nHowever, on the track \"Brooklyn's Finest,\" he made mention of a particular champagne, Cristal.\nFor ten years, various artists and groups within the hip-hop community frequently mentioned Cristal\non their albums and displayed it in videos to demonstrate wealth and power. until the community\nbanned it. (This was subsequently lifted.)25 Similarly, retro trends are often re-popularized numerous\ntimes. The concept of a grill (jewelry that consists of a piece of sometimes precious metal that\n25 Adaso, Henry. Jay-Z, Hip-Hop Community Boycott Cristal. 15 June 2006. 31 October 2009\n<http://rap.about.com/b/2006/06/15/jay-z-hip-hop-community-boycotts-cristal.htm>.\nDiaz 8\n\ncovers the teeth) is a trend that became popular in New York in the 1980's. This was revived during\nthe rise of the Dirty South rappers in the early 2000's.26\nGiven that this assessment of culture proves valid, then auto-tune appears to following a\nsimilar path to other trends characteristic to the hip-hop community. For example, much like Nate\nDogg,27 T-Pain began his career as a mostly \"featured\" artist.28 Similar to clothing, alcohol, or cars,\nfeaturing a popular guest on an album is another example of a trend that is common with hip-hop,\nmirroring the revival of a set tradition in community. However, with the rise of his solo popularity,\nT-Pain's usage as a secondary commodity began to diminish. When it became apparent that his\noriginal style of sound was something that could be theoretically easily emulated given the right\nparameters on a simple plug-in (a simple Google search will retrieve dozens of \"how to get T-Pain's\nsound\" tutorials), a multitude of other artists soon flocked to auto-tuning, demonstrating how\nsomeone that may be new to the hip-hop scene can still be influential.\nClosely related to trends is the effect of economics on the development of hip hop music. In\naddition to keeping up with their peers within trend-setting and -following, the members of the hip-\nhop community are in constant self-competition to stay on of top of what is popular and desirable\nto the public. In the case of auto-tune music, the artists are thriving in its support from the public,\nand its usage is increasing due to its perceived value. For example, Kayne West's last album, 808's\nand Heartbreak, is currently selling at a Platinum level with at least a million copies sold.29 In Florida,\nthe Miami Dolphins football team recently hired T-Pain and artist Pitbull to refresh the team's\n26 Sims, Brian.

In considering today's generation of music performers and listeners, the\nenvironment in which they thrive must also be considered. Dubbed the \"ringtone generation\"31 for\ntheir propensity to value music in the form of cell phone accessories and digital media, today's\npreteens, teenagers, and young adults (ages 10-25) are immersed in a world where technology has\nbeen a critical part of their daily routines throughout their entire lifespans.\nWith approximately 9.2 million \"tweens\" (ages 8-12) owning cell phones in the United\nStates, easy accessibility to technology can be assumed for a majority of the country.32 Compared to\nmusic electronics of the past, auto-tune is a fairly compact and easily reached tool. The iPhone app\nnamed, \"I Am T-Pain,\" produced by Antares that allows for auto-tuning on the go33 has reached\nrecord sales, selling approximately 10,000 copies per day as recently as early November 2009.34\nAlong with technology being everywhere, it is not only expected to work but also to work\nwell and with little effort. Auto-tune is an interesting tool in its simplification of complex music\n30 Pitbull, T-Pain Record Miami Dolphins Theme Song. 10 August 2009.

The entertainment value may be found in the instant gratification of a\ndesirable sound without the time and exertion that comes with voice training and practice.\nThe internet also plays a colossal role in what music stays relevant in today's generation, not\nonly in how people receive information but also in how it is transmitted between groups. Between\nthe ease of social networking communication and the prevalence of viral videos, people will both\ncreate and share what entertains them on the World Wide Web.\nAuto-tune's relevance is constantly being renewed on the internet through the creativity of\nits users. With videos like \"Auto-Tune the News,\"35 a mash-up of newscasts set to music and played\nwith auto-tune, and the usage of auto-tune in gaming media like the song \"Still Alive\"36 from the\npopular game, Portal, auto-tune usage within contemporary music will most likely disappear sooner\nfrom pop culture than the auto-tune content on the web will.\nGiven that a new technology surfaces within the United States, it is commonly observed that\nmost of the population will only focus on its popular intended purpose and be satisfied with the\nlimits that are assigned to it. However, when the same equipment is reflected upon within the\nmindset of another region, new creative outlooks may take place, providing new uses that may have\nbeen neglected or simply never considered. Many countries outside of the United States have\nembraced creative uses of auto-tune because of the jilted sounds it can produce. For example, in\nNorth Africa, contemporary Rai and Berber music features glissandos that can be easily emulated with\nthe synthetic sounds of the auto-tuner. This may seem problematic given the technologies steep\nprice index. However, given that these countries see far less strict regulation and enforcement of\n35 schmoyoho.

However,\nwhile it has many current uses, it seems probable that auto-tune will eventually become less frequent\nas a noticeable technology in popular music and will be used mostly for concealed song correction\nand in special interest ensembles.\nIt is difficult to gauge how long its popularity will last and what other inventive avenues it\nmay take. Given its current influence over the music of today, we may see the development of an\nentirely new genre or instrument. Though, with forces such as Jay-Z leading a pack of a growing\nnegative force that is aimed to end the abuse of the technology, the possibility is present that\ninnovative auto-tune development could be halted before its potential can be reached.\nNevertheless, it is important to note that regardless of whatever the outcome may be, a\nsingle constant remains true throughout all of music history: the development of new music\ntechnology and performance is always moving forward. Musical technologies tend to build on\nthemselves, and auto-tune itself was the product of forward thinking on other idea. The musical\nstruggle that may rise from its exclusion in popular music will surely produce an interesting debate,\nwithout, the youth of this generation will unquestionably be there, waiting to pick up what is left\nover and create musical \"magic\" with the pieces that remain.\n37 Clayton, Jace. \"Pitch Perfect.\" frieze May 2009.\nDiaz 12\n\nDiaz 13\n\nWorks Cited\n\n[ H ] titles at Aquarius Records. 24 October 2009. 29 October 2009\n<http://www.aquariusrecords.org/cat/h.html>.\n65, Eiffel. \"Blue (Da Ba Dee).\" Europop. 1998.\nAdaso, Henry.

      "content": "Anonymous MIT student\n21M.380\nNovember 2009\nFrom the Rhythmicon to the TR808: How electronic rhythm reached maturity\nIn its April 1987 issue, Popular Mechanics proudly pronounced that \"Now, pro and amateur\nalike have the opportunity to play any musical instrument they wishregardless of musical trainingat\nthe touch of a finger,\" [1]. For many, the last half century of trials and tribulations with electronic music\ntechnology could finally be hailed a success. However, the early visionaries that laid the groundwork\nfor electronic music would have hardly named these words as synonymous with \"success.\" Henry\nCowell was one such visionary. His 1930 treatise on \"New Musical Resources\" was one of the first\nexplorations of how new electronic music technologies might open doors to wholly new realms of\ncomposition. \"By early 1931, Henry Cowell had been writing complex rhythms in his music for over ten\nyears with little hope hearing them performed accurately [2].\" To him, modern advances might finally\nbring his musical ideas to life. In the following year Cowell commissioned Leon Theremin to prototype\nthe first electronic rhythm machine, the Rhythmicon.\nThe 1987 article described the success of products that were little more than electronic gadgets.\nIronically, it was about that time that Cowell's vision of an electronic rhythm instrument finally\nachieved similar acclaim, in the form of Roland's TR808. Importantly, the TR808 was borne not only\nfrom the failed ashes of its technological predecessors but also the successes of less ambitious\ntechnologies that were similarly hailed in two page spreads of glossy magazines. These transient\ntechnologies between the Rhythmicon and modern electronic drum machines all had the potential to\npush musical boundaries, but instead achieved success as novel gadgetry, accompanying organ sounds\nin suburban living rooms. Regardless of the musical ambition behind such devices like the\n\nChamberlain Rhythmmate or Wurlitzer's Sideman each new electronic rhythm instrument made\nimportant contributions to developing the core attributes of electronic rhythm technology. To finally be\nconsidered mature, developers would need endow these machines with a clear musical purpose, an\neffective interface, and a sonic aesthetic that would be embraced by musicians and the popular culture.\nWhile it has been described as the \"prototype for all modern drum machines,\" [3] the\nRhythmicon hardly garnered any praise when it was debuted at New York's New School for Social\nResearch in 1932. The machine was designed to achieve Cowell's highest musical ambitions. In\nanticipation of its existence, Cowell invented a system of notation for the instrument and even\ncompleted a four movement composition for orchestra and Rhythmicon, Rhythmicana. However,\nCowell's enthusiastic preparations would prove futile. By 1938 the failure of the Rhythmicon was so\ncomplete that Stanford University chose to simply discard one of the two machines in existence - with\nCowell's permision to do so. As the \"prototype,\" the Rhythmicon will serve as an adequate template for\nanalyzing the forthcoming technologies in electronic rhythm. The Rhythmicon failed to a achieve a\nclear musical purpose, it was hindered by a poor interface, and its sonic aesthetic was best described by\none San Francisco critic as, \"a cross between a grunt and a snort\" [4]. However, future instruments\nwould find solutions to each of these problems.\nThe first Rhythmicon was a large organlike box with 10 white keys and 8 black keys. It is\nunclear who deserves credit for the brunt of the technical specifications behind the machine. It is\nknown that Leon Theremin, already famous for the electronic instrument that bears his name, built the\nmachine. It is also known that Henry Cowell comissioned its construction for a mere 200$. Considering\nthe five figure offers Theremin was receiving from Hollywood to invent new sounds for the silver\nscreen, Theremin was essentially doing the work probono. Cowell boasted the interest of other\ncontemporary composers in the project, such as Nicholas Slominsky and Joseph Schillinger. Theremin\n\nturned to these and other theorists for advice on the machine's construction. Finally, in may of 1932, the\nRhythmicon was debuted in New York.\nIn terms of its musical purpose, Cowell had a clear vision the Rhythmicon. He had described in\nNew Musical Resources the idea of connecting musical intervals to rhythmic ones [5]. For example the\n1:1 unison interval might correspond to a 1‚ÅÑ4 note, the perfect fourth to a 3:4 synchopation and the\nperfect octave to a 1/8 note. Cowell sought to explore more complex polyrythms (several rhythmic\npatterns simultaneously) in his compositions and he used this linkage between intervals and rhythm to\ndo so. Even after the failure of Rhythmicon, Cowell and others continued to pursue polyrhythms.\nCowell eventually turned to training musicians to play these sophistocated patterns using standard\nacoustic instruments. In this way, Rhythmicon had a clear musical purpose. Although one which is\nnearly unrelated to the how electronic rhythm machines are used today. Later Leland Smith and others\nwould use computers to achieve the musical goals Cowell had set forth. Smith used his computer music\nprogram SCORE to recreate the Rhythmicon for the very first performance of Cowell's Rhythmicana in\n1971 [1]. The Rhythmicon was an inappropriate technology for achieving an otherwise valid musical\ngoal. Unfortunately, this was as detrimental as lacking any clear musical purpose at all.\nRhythmicon was designed with a keyboard style interface similar to a piano's. This design\nalmost certainly stemmed from Cowell's tight linkage between sonic intervals and rhythmic ones.\nCowell himself remarked that the complex rhythms he envisioned could have simply been cut on the\nrolls of a player piano [5]. However, his intention was to offer a greater level of interactivity.\nImportantly, the Rhythmicon anticipated a fundamental element of modern electronic rhythm\ninterfaces, the separation of gesture and output. As the player held a key, the Rhythmicon would\nproduce a series of tones rather than hold constant with the players finger. This separation was\nrevolutionary at the time but proved to be too primitive. Cowell compained, \"Since there was no way\n\nof giving melodic freedom by varying the note lengths in a single part, and no method\nof accenting,\" that he was still unable to use Rhythmicon to perform many of his experimental works\n[6]. Critics complained of the Rhythmicon's overtly machinelike monotony. To Cowell, the machine's\nlack of expressiveness made its interface equal value to the piano roll.\nAbove all else, the sound of the Rhythmicon drew harsh remarks from critics. Schillinger, who\nwas the sole owner of a Rhythmicon until the 1960's, claimed that the machine could produce tones\nsimulating african drumming. However, critics described its sound as something between rhythmicized\ngrunts and an Indian war woop [1]. Either way, modern recreations of the machine show that its sound\nwas not very compelling. The tones were produced via the rotation of a wheel, in which concentric\nrings of holes had been cut. Light passes through the holes, to be detected on the other side by a\nphotosensor. Varying the speed of the turn as well as the position of the sensor along the wheel\ndetermined the frequency and timbre of the instrument. A similar design would be used by Hammond\nin his early organ, with the fundamental addition of controls that could fine tune the timbre of the notes.\nWith the best intentions and ambition, Cowell and Theremin set out to build a device that would\nchange the way rhythm could be addressed in modern compositions. While their invention was a\nfailure, the Rhythmicon made a lasting contribution to the groundwork of modern electronic rhythm. In\nthe Pollard Syndrum, similar mechanical tones to Rhythmicon's will find a niche within the popular\naesthetic. However, the Roland TR808 will become a case study in the success of an interface that\nseparates gesture from output. However, the issue of a viable musical purpose for electronic rhythm\nremains unanswered in 1932. Cowell's polyrhythms are still considered experimental even today, and\nhad little influence on progression of electronic rhythm technology.\nIn 1956 Harry Chamberlain demonstrated the fruits of over six years of basement toiling at the\nannual trade show of the National Association of Music Merchants. Chamberlain recorded short\n\nsegments of acoustic drumming, and his device could play them back at various speeds and\npermutations. After adding an integrated amplifier and embedding the whole device inside a speaker\ncabinet he dubbed the machine the Rhythmate. Cowell had turned to technology to achieve a higher\nmusical goal that he felt was unobtainable by alternative means. Chamberlain's device, however, aimed\nto replace cumbersome acoustic drums and the expertise of drummers. Thus, by design the Rhythmate\navoided any problem of musical purpose. It was quite obvious what the machine was used for.\nChamberlain recalls that, \"they began to go hear these things and they were so good that\n[members of the musicians unions] began to get scared...that we would beat all the musicians out of\nbusiness.\" [7]. Unfortunately for drummers, much of popular music of the day incorporated only steady\nbeats and simple time keeping. A tape loop device was the perfect solution to high wages and imperfect\nplaying. Only a short while later, unionists' fears were partially realized. Chamberlain's later devices,\nthe M1 and M4, combined tape loops and organ technology to effectively replace entire orchestras\nwith a single instrument. At a cost of $3,995, studios often turned to the M1 to \"inject their demos\nwith some class\" [7] without actually hiring an orchestra. Although the musicians union effectively\nbanned the use of the M4 and set wage floors on players of Chamberlain's machines or their\nderivatives, this technology hardly replaced the sounds of the real instruments [7].\nWhat Chamberlain had stumbled upon was an economic need rather than a musical one. If a\nsong lacked sophistication in its rhythm, then the added cost acoustic percussion could be altogether\navoided. This is a vital factor in the progression of electronic rhythm. These machines afforded the\nability to experiment with music in one's basement or bedroom, meaning that a generation of artists\ncould uncover more progressive genres. As musicians found more sophisticated uses for these new\ntechnologies, manufacturers accommodated them with upgraded models. This positive feedback loop\ndrove a generation of musical innovation in hip hop, techno, pop, rock, and virtually every other form of\n\npopular music.\nThe Rhythmate offered an extremely simple interface that made it easy to use. The machine had\nfourteen tape loops, each with three tracks. A single tape head, fixed to a slider bar, could be\npositioned over any of the tapes. Once in position, the tape head could be \"fine tuned,\" positioning it\nover or in between tape tracks to blend the various sounds on each tape together. This was done with a\nsingle dimensional lever. Tempo, and pitch along with it, could be controlled via rotary knobs. The\nbuilt in amplifier featured the standard volume, bass, mid, and treble controls. Derivative devices such\nas the Chamberlain M1 and the Mellotron would integrate these kind of tape loops into keyboards.\nHolding down a key ran a tape track to the amplifier. The new tapes featured percussive sounds and\neven real samples of orchestral instruments. These devices offered no native mechanism to create or\nrecord new samples into the tape loops. More experimental users had been known to push the limits of\nthese early drum machines, motivated by the opportunities suggested by an interactive tape loop. For\nexample Don Buchla, who designed several monolithic synthesizers at the same time as Moog,\ndiscussed the Chamberlain in an interview \"Yes we could [program those], although as I said with\nsome difficulty...you had three tracks...and six locations...I think you had nine seconds or so before it\nwould spring back...so it was quite powerful, with the number of sounds you could put in it.\" [8]. Don\nBuchla's early experiments turning Chamberlain's machines into programmable synthesizers would\nbear fruit later as digital sampling simplified this process.\nThe sounds of a Rhythmate were essentially the sounds of the drums recorded in its tape loops.\nIn this way, it was not a strictly electronic rhythm instrument in the same way that the Rhythmicon was.\nHowever, encouraged by Chamberlain's success, the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company released the first\nmachine to synthesize drum sounds, the Sideman. Like its predecessors the Sideman was intended to\naccompany the organ but could be used elsewhere. Wurlitzer saw that the Rhythmate had a successful\n\ncombination of purpose and interface, but decided that its success was not married to the recordings on\nthe tape loops. This was convenient since the machine was plagued with reliability issues due to its use\nof tapes. In addition, Wurlitzer avoided the optoelectronic design of the Rhythmicon, likely because it\ntoo was mechanically unreliable and a lacked a compelling sound. Instead the Sideman relied on tube\ncircuitry to generate imitation drum sounds like a simple snare drum, a bass, and a cymbal crash. The\nsounds could be triggered manually or by the use of a sequencing wheel. The Sideman came with 10\npreset sequences on the wheel, which could be spin at any speed without affecting pitch.\nWurlitzer's machine was extremely popular. Record producer Hal Davis wrote about the\nSideman:\n\"After plugging it in, I was trying out some of the rhythms before getting ready to\nresume playing our next set. The others of the group were busy watching while I\ntried to set it up. Suddenly, I looked up and saw three couples on the dance floor\ndancing to the rhythm of the Sideman all by itself.\" [9]\nHaving finally uncovered a suitable sonic aesthetic, The Sideman stands as the final \"precursor\"\ninstrument to modern electronic rhythm technologies.\nIn 1964, Japenese designer Ikutaru Kakehashi unveiled the R1 Rhythm Ace at the same trade\nshow that had received the Rhythmate eight years earlier. The R1 was essentially a clone of the\nSideman, with a very important difference - the R1 was made using transistors. Using solid state\ntechnology, Kakehashi was able to massively reduce the cost and size of his drum machine and increase\nits reliability. The Rhythm Ace and similar solid state devices were so successful that artists began to\nuse electronic rhythm in the recording studio. Robin Gibb of of the Bee Gees, Sly and the Family Stone,\nand JJ Cale are all credited as pioneers of electronic rhythm for their use of drum machines in chart\ntopping recordings. For example, Gibb's 1969 single \"Saved by the Bell\" incorporates the 'slow rock'\n\npreset of a later version of the Rhythm Ace. Building off of his earlier success, Kakehashi released the\nTR808, one of the quintessential drum machines of the modern age. By this time, Kakehashi's devices\nwere labeled under his new brand, Roland.\nThe TR808 brought the evolution of electronic rhythm into the modern age. The TR808\nembodied effective alternatives to each of the elements which led to Rhythmicon's failure, a clear\nmusical purpose, a rich interface, and a sonic aesthetic that would be embraced by musicians and\nlisteners alike. The TR808, and later the TR909, not only gave artists the ability to replace conventional\ndrums in their music, but also extend how rhythm is used. The quantized rhythms produced by the\nmachine were essential in beat matching, a practice made popular on the turntables of DJ Cool Herc\nand others. Furthermore, the machine could generate rhythms endlessly and at high energy. In live\nperformances and dance clubs, rhythm was able to take on a new role as a driving force, unburdened by\ndrummers' fatigue.\nThe TR808's interface was lean, but very expressive. Artists would select from the 12 preset\ninstruments at the top of the machine. Each were percussive sounds of some kind that could vary in\ndecay, volume, and timbre via a control panel. Using a process called step entry, artists would then\nassociate that instrument with a particular beat in a measure, down to a resolution of 1/8th note triplets.\nThe machine would loop through the single measure, playing each of the associated sounds in\nsequence. Any beat could be selected as the loop back point, allowing for short fills or unique time\nsignatures. Furthermore, the TR808 could store many of these beat patterns, for use later. Thus, using\nthe TR808 combined preparation with performance. While playing live, artists could fall back on\nsequences they had stored in the machines memory, modify the acoustics of individual instruments, or\nsequence entirely new beats on the fly. This unprecedented level of direct interactivity was essential in\nthe progression of electronic rhythm. Like Cowell had envisioned, the TR808 clearly separated gesture\n\nfrom output. However, unlike the Rhythmicon, the TR808 would continue to sound off even without\nany gesture at all from the performer. Artists could interact with the machine as much or as little as they\nneeded, allowing them build up persistent rhythms in their performances and move their attention\nelsewhere. Returning later to the 808, these performers can move the rhythm in a new direction, with no\nneed to skip a beat.\nOnly 12,000 TR808 sequencers were sold by Roland between 19804 [10]. However, over time,\nthe instrument's sonic properties would incubate a cult following. Still today TR808's are constantly\ntraded on the secondhand market. Record producer Ray Keith described the sound of the TR808 kick\ndrum as \"like a tidal wave...the sound just travels right through you\" [11]. Other instruments on the\ndevice were just as unique. The snare drum had an extra \"snappy\" parameter. The cowbell, although a\npoor imitation of the real thing, made a popular electronic ping sound. Other included sounds were low\nmid and high toms, congas, the infamous hand clap, maracas, rimshot, and cymbal.\nThe TR808 was a pure synthesis instrument, which led many to view it as inferior to digital\nsample based instruments like the Linn LM1. However, the 12 preset instruments on the 808 became\nsought after by a generation of artists seeking a weird electronic alternative to drum machines that held\nclose to the aesthetics of acoustic drums. The TR808 \"sound\" was captured by the Beastie Boys'\nbreakout album License to Ill, and by Marvin Gaye on his hit single Sexual Healing. Graham Massey\neven named his fusion group after the machine, calling it 808State. Even modern hip hop artists like\nKanye West pay tribute to the TR808 and its sound. West named his fourth album 808's and\nHeartbreak, insisting that the drum machine has a presence on every track (although it is unclear\nwhether this is true).\nRoland's cult classic drum machine, the TR808, marks the beginning of maturity for electronic\nrhythm. Today, drum machines are ubiquitous in nearly all forms of popular music, an achievement\n\nwhich took nearly fifty years once Cowell and Theremin met massive failure with the Rhythmicon. To\nreach this stage, designers overcame the shortcomings of the Rhythmicon which can be encapsulated in\nterms of its musical purpose, its interface, and, of course, its sound. Harry Chamberlin, along with his\ncompetitors and organ manufacturers demonstrated that the role of rhythm in much of popular music\nwas one that could be easily filled by technology. Later, the Rhythm Ace cut the ties with acoustic\ndrumming altogether. The Ace proved that electronic percussive sounds had an aesthetic all their own,\none that was worthy building the rhythmic foundation behind many hit records. The TR808 finally\nperfected this sound with electronic voices that had freestanding appeal, despite bearing little similarity\nto any acoustic instrument (that could have been achieved with digital sampling). More importantly, the\nTR808 solidified the interface to modern electronic rhythm, step entry. This fundamental approach\nallowed musicians to give rhythm a new purpose altogether in music, through the persistence of the\nbeats created with it. Furthermore, the direct interactivity of this approach ensured that artists would\ncontinue to experiment with the TR808 and similar devices to fully explore and exploit the new sonic\nspace of electronic rhythm.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Popular Mechanics, 1987.

      "content": "Greg Perkins\n21M.380 Technology Case Study Final Draft\n2009-12-06\nDuration in Composition\nThe sound of a phonograph record's playback is as iconic as it is widespread. The recording is\nomnipresent. Its presence implies repetition. With the recording's ubiquity has come not just\nthe ubiquitous repetition of those recordings, but the realization of repeated sound as the\nuniversal constituent of musical composition. The recording precipitated a paradigm shift in the\nconcept of repetition. Understood as a motive underlying musical production since long before\nthe captured sound, repetition is a response to a frustration with music's durational nature and\nan acknowledgement of its limited sonic constitution.\nRepetition and Mutation\nAll sound involves some element of repetition. Our ears perceive the repetitive propagation of\nmolecules in a transmission medium. In representations of sound, there is necessarily a\nstructural pattern that is generative of this propagation.\nSound transmission must involve some element of mutation as well: radio transmission,\nrecording and reproduction, amplification, spatial reverberation, and even projection through\nthe air are mutations that occur universally to sound in its normal course of movement and\ndistribution. Electronic filtering is one esoteric example of mutation. The more fundamental\nmutations are those physical manipulations that give rise to varying pitch in classical\ninstrumentation and to the vocal variation that constitutes our speech. A mutation is any\nchange in the structure of a wave or its recorded representation between two of its instances in\nspace and time.\nMutations require recognition, but they are recognizable only in contrast. We perceive two\nsounds as separate precisely when we can tell the difference between them. Our ears\nsuperficially perceive a continuous stream of vibrations and translate them directly to neural\nsignals. In breaking this river of 'sound' into discrete 'sounds', the brain engages in two types of\nseparation: delineation of sounds that can be separated in time, and distinguishing of sounds\nthat are concurrent in time. If neither of these separations\nare possible between two sets of stimuli, they will be conflated and considered as a single\nsound.\nIn composition, construction of a narrative requires the production of sounds that are\nperceived as distinct by the audience. This process of separation, accomplished by the mutation\nof a repeated form, and is thus a superstructure to the process of repetition. The construction\nof multiple concurrent narratives requires the ability to distinguish the concurrent sounds and\ntheir assignment to different voices or sources. Both of these processes of sound recognition\noccur within the listener.\n\nThe perception of a distinct sound event is this process of identifying it relative to other sounds.\nIn the presence of visual stimulation we easily associate the sound with a more general event\nthat we assign as its source. Here repetition is discernible through both the sound and other\nstimulation caused by its event. In the absence of other sense input, a given aural stimuli has\nsome aspect of repetition only if it is recognized as similar to a prior sound. To perceive a sound\nis to compare it with one's memory of prior sounds, determining its character in reference to\nthe listener's existing ontological categories.\nWhen we hear the sound of a violin string, we discount the mutations incurred in its\ntransmission, and subsume what we consider internal mutations: the shortening of the string,\nthe variation in body and bow from earlier violin sounds, and the slight movement on the\nfingerboard causing minute variations in pitch between notes. These internal mutations\nbecome the 'note'. Together with the repetition of the violin, we recognize a 'sound'.\nComposition and Repetition\nAny instrument has an expectation of repeatability, of similar parametric transformations and\nmanipulations producing a repeatable sound as output. The representation of music has long\nassumed this repeatability of timbre: in the score, we are given only a pitch and a system used\nto generate that pitch. The control information embedded in a score is all that which is not\ninvolved in the mechanical or generation of the sound. It is understood that we can provide the\nsignified timbre by properly preparing and playing a given instrument. The repeat symbol or\nhigher-order repetition directives are incidental: fundamentally music is repeating a physical\ntransformation that generates a sound prescribed by a given score.\nRepetition is thus at the heart of musical composition: whether from the primitive analog\nsynthesis of a Roland TR-808 drum machine, from the demure output of the 2A03 sound chip in\na Nintendo game console, or from the massive piano. Even in the absence of mutations, we can\ngenerate musical rhythm through repetition. Mutation simply allows more complex\ncomposition through modification of the repeated sounds.\nThe classical composition begins with an instrument and directives for controlling the\ninstrument. A composition consists of a selection of instruments along with the arrangement of\ntheir physical parameter settings in time. The experience of the piece of music, however, is not\nentirely described by the compositional arrangement of mutations in time. It is also strongly\ndetermined by the underlying set of sonic material: timbres, assumed by the composer, that\nare fundamentally repetitions. Beyond the material repetitions of sound units, there are larger\nstructures of sound that are repeated, such as motives or phrases in classical music (Brandt).\nPerformances of scores are themselves repetitions of a prescribed composition. Live\nimprovisations demand and invite high level mutations, but the mechanics of their generation\nare still fundamentally repetitive. The performer's formation of expectation about the sound\nthey can produce is dependent on the repeatability of its function.\nIn any of these repetitions, mutations emerge. Performers are human: pitches are not exactly\nas prescribed. Timing is inexact in larger phrases. Atmospheric conditions affect performances\nfrom day to day and hour to hour. All these mutations put tremendous pressure on a paradigm\n\nof composition that trusted a minute number of sounds. Composition became a rigorous\nmathematical activity, clearly discernible from its surroundings by its score. Its performance, as\nPaul Hindemith notes \"depends on the closest physical and mental proximity of not more than\na few hundred listeners.\" (Schwartz 84)\nFrom this teeming mass of mutation emerged the recording. Recording is the pinnacle of\nrepetition, the purist of scores, and the enabler of the most prescriptive compositions. Human\neccentricity in performance is supplanted by the occult (but ostensibly reliable) intricacies of\nmechanical and electronic reproduction. The recording affected music composition in two\nways: it replaced the score as the most specific means of communicating a composition, and it\ndramatically expanded the set of source timbres available to the composer.\nInfinite Sound\n\"The phonographic composer may first listen to the sound he wishes to combine, choosing\nwhat he wants from numberless possibilities at his disposal.\" -- composer Carol-Berard, 1929\n(Katz 109)\nNew sounds challenge our perception. Challenges to perception beget composition. But as\ncomposition requires repetition through mutation, the recorded sound becomes less\nchallenging and more constituent. The human brain re-associates the sound with its recent\ncontext, namely, the composition. So at least for the duration of the composition, the sound\nbecomes a platform for manipulation.\nThe range of possible manipulations to the sound are described by the mechanical instrument\nthat circumscribes its recording and reproduction. The devices, which are thus of critical\nimportance to the composition, prescribe baseline transmission mutations as well as active\ninterventions.\nEarly works that relied on mutative interventions in gramophone recordings were those of Paul\nHindemith and Ernst Toch at the Neue Musik Berlin festival in 1930. Both regarded their\nrecordings for the festival as an unpublishable diversion from their normal composition. They\nwere regarded as a joke by much of the contemporaneous commentary: Toch himself called it\n\"perhaps a musical joke\". His critics thought of the records as \"burlesque... practical joking\".\n(Katz 111)\nTheir compositions expose only a small segment of the devices' repertoire, mutating the sound\nusing the ability to collect multiple performances into coincident layers (and therefore conflate\npreviously disparate sounds) and the ability to vary the playback speed (and therefore change\nthe pitch and duration). Even in their limited experiments, though, they begin to realize the\ntheorized power of the sound reproduction device as an element rather than a document or\nfragment of a composition. Critically, the reproduction devices are able to repeat their recorded\nsounds under transformations.\nThe produced sound had been experimented with before, with Luigi Russolo's Intonarumori\nnoise machines and the electronic instruments designed by Leon Theremin. But these barely\naccepted works marked the point of transformation of composition based on the instrument to\n\nthat based on the reproduced sound. In hindsight they seem to predict the kind of active\nlistening John Oswald would espouse 50 years later. Their classification as joke reflected the\nanxiety listeners felt in their new found freedom.\nAs devices gave listeners the freedom to choose what music to listen to, so too it gave them\nresponsibility. It seems that the public discourse was not yet ready to recognize that power for\nwhat it was: the ability to compose their own sonic environment, from compositional elements\nmuch more complex than ever before available.\nResponsibility\nIn the decades that followed, few musicians would compose with recorded sound, for lack of\napparent interest. John Cage's \"Imaginary Landscape\" in 1939 marked the usage of a\nmultiplicity of recorded sound sources in a greater composition. This was a distillation of the\ntechniques used by Hindemith and Toch: Cage attended their concert in Berlin. (Katz 113) His\nwork, in contrast, focused almost entirely on mutation; the source material is intended to be\nnon-repetitive. Pierre Schaeffer again rediscovered the techniques in his \"Concert of Noises\"\nbroadcast in 1948. He expanded the instrumentation of the turntable, through \"variation of\nrecording and reproduction speeds, sampling and editing by manipulation of the pickup,\nlooping of recorded grooves, backwards playing of disks, loudness modulations, and fade-in and\nfade-out.\" (Sitsky 433)\nSchaeffer's work briefly preceded the introduction of widespread tape recording, and\nprecipitated a worldwide explosion in the theory and practice of sound music composition, with\nthe works of Edgar Varese, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Hugh Le Caine. Varese characterizes the\nnew concept of the composer as \"a worker in rhythms, frequencies, and intensities,\" and\nasserts that he, \"like all artists, is an organizer of disparate elements.\" (Schwartz 207)\nIn 1952, Stockhausen began work in the style of Schaeffer's musique concrete, working a\ntremendous variety of recorded sounds into what was to become a strongly anti-repetitive\nnarrative style. We recognize here the voice of the machine in all its glorious ability to\nreproduce. Hugh Le Caine's 1955 \"Dripsody\" explores an alternate extreme of repetition under\nstrict limitations. The systematic restriction he uses projects the mutations into a single\ndimensional sound space. We recognize in his piece the voice of the drop alone.\nEdgar Varese asserts \"Our new medium has brought to composers almost endless possibilities\nof expression, and opened up for them the whole mysterious world of sound... Composers are\nnow able, as never before, to satisfy the dictates of that inner ear of the imagination. They are\nalso lucky so far in not being hampered by esthetic codification -- at least not yet!\" (Schwartz\n208). All of these artists are attempting to compose with variations that emerge from the\nturntable and tape recorder. They are emerging from a radical depressurization of the\ncompositional landscape, brought on by the appearance of an instrument capable of\nreproducing sounds in an almost boundless sample space.\nThe pressured use of given instruments here began to crumble, and in its place came great\nconfusion regarding the proper repetitive basis of composition. If mutation could be infinite,\nwhat might the concept of instrument mean? If Toch & Hindemith's works indicated the\n\nresponsibility of the listener in the age of recorded sound, then their followers exposed the\nresponsibility of the composer.\nFinite Composition\nThe devices involved in the reproduction of sound from physical objects are as physical as the\nrecordings themselves and the human participants in the compositional and performative\nprocess. The system is bounded by physical laws and the construction of the devices\nthemselves. The recordings, likewise, are bounded by the shape and size of their physical\nmedia.\nThe availability of sound from a mechanical recording is dependent on a sufficient mechanical\ninfrastructure for its reproduction. The score requires human musical interpretation, passed on\nin a tradition of transmitting the knowledge required to interpret, perform, and write\ncompositions. The recording is much less robust: its infrastructure is more fragile. But it is\nnevertheless more accessible in the short term, since its performance requires no local time\ninvestment. It is engineered out of the mind and into the physical world.\nThe first playback mechanisms were the Thomas Edison's phonographs. These played helical\ngrooves embedded within wax cylindrical media. Recording began with human initiated contact\nbetween the stylus and the wax cylinder. Recording continued as long as the cylinder was\ncontinually rotated against the stylus, and stopped when this rotation stopped, the needle was\nlifted, or the cylinder hit the stopper at the end of the device. (Bottone) The end of the\nrecording, with this first device, was abrupt. Since the turning motion required was that same\nmotion which drove the lateral motion of the needle relative to the cylinder, the end of this\nmotion resulted in an unknown. If the playback continued past the end of the recorded region,\nthe sound output would translate the imperfections in the unrecorded part of the medium into\nsound.\nBut while the rotation of the device was motorized by Charles Edgar Fritts as early as 1880\n(Fritts 1916), the ability to stop it automatically remained frustrating until the gramophone. The\nradial rotation of the recording medium was no longer strictly correlated with the progression\nof the recorded sound. Detached from the rigidity of the rotating screw, the new process\nallowed for a more graceful recording endpoint, in which the tone arm sits in a rotating circular\ngroove until the user intervenes. It requires, however, another degree of freedom, that of the\nmotion of the tonearm rather than just the rotation of the physical medium.\nVery quickly that intervention became automatic: the gramophone devices themselves were\noften constructed to detect this circular groove and return the tone arm to its resting position,\nusing a timing mechanism driven by lateral motion of the tonearm, thus re-associating the\nprogression of the recorded sound with the functioning of the device. (Spengler) In the\nautomatic-reset turntable, the lateral progression of the tonearm provides a mechanical\nmonitor of the sound's output. The turntable detached the listener from the endpoint of the\nmusic in that the runout groove made it no longer dangerous. The automatic-reset turntable\nmakes the listener downright redundant at the end of the recording, as if their purpose had\n\nbeen fulfilled. The listener initiates the beginning of the musical reproduction, but the duration\nand cessation of the act are determined.\nIt is a rare instrument for which the musician must both begin and end the production of sound.\nThe phonograph as built by Edison required a great deal of attention to operate: one had to\nattend to it completely and continuously. The evolution of recording devices has provided a\nprogressive reduction in the amount of attention required. Automation of the medium's\nrotation and then of the cessation of its rotation provided the ability to subconscously listen to\na prescribed set of sounds. Listeners began to compose, to score their own lives with the\ninstrument of the turntable. The wax media were never constructed to the specifications of\nmusic production: they evolved mainly in response to demands of listeners. They thus failed,\nlargely, to advance composition even given the tremendous power they could theoretically\noffer composers. They failed to provide what magnetic tape would beginning in the 1950's.\nMagnetic tape promised to remove the eccentricities of recording and reduce it to a\ntransparent representation of the recorded sound. The tape loop asserted the possibility to\nrepeat any sound endlessly. At the same time, it removed the possibility for such sounds to be\nheard accidentally. A tape cannot skip in the way that a disk record can.\nThe major distinction between tape loops and their disk parallels were the tapes' flexibility in\ntime: they have no real upper bound on duration, and the \"usual problem is devising loops that\nare short enough to give quick repetitions when desired.\" (Dwyer 31) The repetition only had a\nconceptual upper bound, in that \"sound events with a period longer than five or ten seconds\nbegin to be perceived less as repetitions by listeners.\" (Keane 60)\nThe tape loop had a curious relation to meaning: \"repetition allows us to examine and re-\nexamine the sounds in a way not possible when the sounds are heard only once... many sounds\nquickly become annoying when they are repeated literally (witness a scratched record which\ncauses the needle to jump back repeatedly to the same place).\" (Keane 59) Steve Reich would\nlater insist of his 1965 piece, \"It's Gonna Rain\" that \"the incessant repetition intensified [the\nwords'] meaning and their melody at one and the same time.\" (Reich p19)\nThis is hard to believe. If this is the track's goal, to amplify sounds' signified meaning and their\nformal characteristics at the same time, then it fails. Tape is still an intermediary, an external\ndevice. The amplification of sounds' formal characteristics in our attention is necessarily at the\nexpense of consciousness of their significance. Once we understand the sound as a constituent,\nwe turn our attention to the composition it is a part of, to the broader organization. Our\nsubconscious perception assumes responsibility for the repetition aspects of the sound and it\nbecomes background. This can be seen at all levels of perception: from the conflation of sounds\nrepeated less than 30ms apart to the ubiquity of contemporary personal audio devices and the\nimportance of recognition in appreciation of popular music.\nSteve Reich recognizes the challenge, \"my problem was then to find some new way of working\nwith repetition as a musical technique.\" (Reich 19) His response was a minimalist constraint to\ncomposition within \"limited initial and the limited transformational techniques.\" (Mertens 12)\nFollowing Le Caine's \"Dripsody,\" Reich's Minimalism collapses the last dimension from the\n\nsound. Any variation that a listener perceives is a drift in his own conscious determination of\nsound. The repetition is free of mutation until it reaches our ears.\nReich uses a tape loop played in contrast with itself at a different speed to construct \"It's Gonna\nRain\". In this piece, we hear a gradual phase shift effect, where the slight variations in the\nspeed of the repetitions create contrast between their speeds without perceptible difference in\npitch (or timbre). We focus, then, on the offsets between these repetitions. Ultimately, we do\nnot perceive those samples themselves that are repeated, but instead are conscious of their\nspacing and some temporal analog to the chord that emerges across time in the work.\nAlvin Lucier's 1969 piece, \"I am sitting in a room\" is a reminder of Reich's naive idealism. Lucier\nbrings the entire physical context of the recording act into the composition itself, reminding us\nof the inability to isolate a musical work from the mutations that occur in its transport. By\nallowing a single large sound to propagate far further than usual through his recording space\nand apparatus, he distills the inherent process of mutation to an audible level.\nThe repeated phrases of these compositions, in focusing on the repetitions themselves, have\nthe desire to fill eternity and continue indefinitely. In emerging from the pressure of signified\nmusical notation, music compositions find a new pressure in the confines of the physical\nmedium. It is the constraint of its duration within the physical medium within space which\nlimits their length. The very fact that they are now destined or doomed to be elements in the\nlarger compositions of human lives reduces them from music to sounds.\n\nImagination\nSound & music are fundamentally durational. We as humans perceive ourselves to be more\nimmediately spatial than temporal, and thus to compose is to challenge oneself to disperse\nsounds into an arrangement in time.\nEvery composition exists under the assumption of repeatability, and the composer's challenge\nis to decide what mutations to apply to these possible repetitions. Allowing more mutation\nminimizes the perception of repetition and maximizes the ability to distinguish sounds and\nvoices toward a narrative ideal. In cases of maximal compositional pressure, the listening\napparatus is put in the spotlight: what duration is mandated? What transformations are\nallowed? But ultimately the composition and combination of the sounds, as well as even their\nrecognition, is left to the imagination of the listener.\n\nBibliography\nBottone, Selimo Romeo.

First debuted during\nthe 1980s, it quickly swept the music industry leaving in its wake a variety of\nnever before heard genres such as techno and a bolstering of those which, like\nhip hop, were in dire need of some fresh beats. The 808 has a rich history\nintertwined with the development of many other electronic synthesizers.\nHowever, the mark of a great instrument is defined not by its past, but rather by\nits continued relevance years after it is first unveiled. Consequentially, \"After a\n28-year journey through the subterranea of electro, techno, and regional hip-hop,\nthe 808 has achieved an influential presence in today's popscape\" (Richards). Of\ncourse, the \"popscape\" as a whole can be analyzed to enumerate the countless\nindividual examples of 808 uses, but as has been the case for pop throughout\nthe ages, it is an area which can be defined not as an entity, but rather by merely\none person. Love him or hate him, the current ruler of the pop kingdom is none\nother than Kanye West, and if he uses the TR-808 to make beats, which indeed\nhe does, it must, by association, have risen through the ranks of instrument\nmediocrity and escaped its former kitsch to become relevant to today's music.\n\nThe TR-808 came into existence during the 1980s, however it is the\ndescendent of a long line of technology which came before it and led to the\n\nmachine's ultimate development. Rhythm machines, the original term for today's\ndrum machines, date back to the 1940s with the invention of the Chamberlin\nRhythmate (Brend 60). Originally this, and other rhythm machines, were\ndeveloped with the home organist in mind by creating a rhythmic accompaniment\nsuch that one person could become an entire ensemble. The Rhythmate did not\nuse electronically generated tones, but rather a series of continuously running\ntapes. As such, no drum machine technology spawned directly from it; however it\nwas indeed crucial in implanting the idea of rhythm providing machines into the\nminds of the public (60). In addition, both the Rhythmate and its distant cousin\nthe Mellotron, which also used tape loops, birthed the idea of looping to create\nrhythms. This idea would later be implemented extensively in the use of the 808\nand in many different genres of music, hip hop especially.\n\nFollowing the Rhythmate, and in an effort to increase the versatility of\nrhythm machines, a series of pseudo-electronic and electronic machines were\ncreated during the 1960s. The first of these was the called the Wurlitzer Sideman\nand again, it appealed to home organists searching for a way to both add texture\nand keep time in practice and performance. The Sideman produced electronically\ngenerated sounds and had a series of 12 preset popular rhythms such as waltz\nand foxtrot (61). It was much more widely known and sold than the Rhythmate\nbut perhaps the Sideman's most important contribution was its impact on a\ncompetition between the companies known later as Korg and Roland, the latter\nof which would eventually develop the 808 as a direct result of said competition.\nIkutaro Kakehasi and Tsutomu Katoh, founders of Roland and Korg respectively,\n\nwere each witness to the numerous drawbacks of the Sideman and were thus\ninspired to expand upon its technology (61). Katoh, the owner of a both a\nnightclub and a music shop, was approached by Tadashi Osanai, an\naccordionist, about creating an instrument for accompaniment which would be\nless limiting than the Sideman. These two men opened the Keio Electronics Lab,\nlater known as Korg for 'Keio Organ,' and produced the DA20 DoncaMatic Disk\nRotary Electric Auto Rhythm Machine in 1963 (Reid). The DoncaMatic was\nsimilar to the Sideman except that it used a rotary disc instead of tapes, thus the\nname DoncaMatic deriving from the 'donca, donca' sound which the machine\nmade as the disc spun (Reid). The unit sold quite well in Japan because it was\nthe first of its kind to be produced in the country. Two years later, Roland's\npredecessor, the Ace Electronics Company led by Kakehasi, created the world's\nfirst fully electronic rhythm machine, the Rhythm Ace. This instrument proved to\nbe a financial disaster due to the fact that it had no presets and was thus\nimpossible for an organist to play, unless, of course, they had an extra set of\narms. In response to the Rhythm Ace's fully electronic capability, Katoh released\nan electronic version of the Donca Matic in 1966. It was the first drum machine to\nbe fully automatic and mass produced and it also came in different varieties and\nsizes for different musician's needs (Brend 63). For example, a small portable\nversion was released and aimed at guitarists to aid in keeping the time of\ncomplex rhythms while practicing (Gordon Reid). Finally, in 1967, a new version\nof the Rhythm Ace was released featuring 16 preset patterns, as well as tempo\nsettings for each and defeat buttons allowing the user to mute certain sounds, if\n\nfor instance, the sound of the clave was not crucial to the rhythm which they were\ntrying to achieve (Brend 64). It was indeed this machine which first provided the\nuser with adequate control over their rhythms and thus paved the way for the\n808.\n\nAlthough during the 1970s, many drum machines were in production,\nthese instruments still remained a relatively unused technology in music\nrecording and performance. Also, the development of new drum machines during\nthis period dropped to a minimum with Roland, the new Ace Electronics moniker,\nputting only one or two new models into production during this time. However,\nthe popularity of the drum machine would greatly change with the introduction of\nthe Roland TR-808 in 1980.\nAlthough 1980 also saw the advent of another popular drum machine, the\nLinnDrum, the TR-808 won the market with its smaller size and much more\naffordable price (808 Statement). At the time, the LinnDrum cost $2,495 and sold\n5,000 machines whereas the 808 cost only $1,000 (Colbeck) and sold countless\nmore units. The low price allowed up and coming hip hop artists to make use of\ndrum machine technology. The first of these artists was Afrika Bambaataa with\nhis 1982 hit \"Planet Rock,\" which is widely regarded as the first use of 808 in a\nhip hop track (Richards).\nIn addition to its relatively low cost, the TR-808 had many distinct features\nwhich made it such a popular machine. It allowed the user to compose various\nrhythms and store them in the unit's memory to later arrange them for use in\nsong composition. It could play single songs of up to 768 measures in length, or\n\nup to 12 songs of 64 measures in length. Another feature inherent in 808 design\nwas the fact that each quarter note beat could be divided into 3, 4, 6, or 8 steps\nsuch that rhythms could encompass up to 32nd notes (TR-808 Operation Manual\n1). This feature allowed for the 808 to perform extremely complex rhythms that a\nlive drummer could perhaps not accurately play, thus creating one use for the\nTR-808 in live performance.\nAccording to the TR-808 users manual, the 808 is \"A unique and versatile\nrhythm device\" (1). Indeed, with its ability to play 32 different percussive rhythms\nusing 11 different sounds and accents, the 808 was the most adaptable drum\nmachine to ever hit the market (1). These sounds included bass drum, snare\ndrum, a variety of toms and congas, rim shot, claves, hand clap, maracas,\ncowbell, cymbals, and hihats (1), many of which sounded nothing like their\nacoustic counterparts but would nonetheless later become quintessential sounds\nof various genres. \"Whereas drum machines like the Linn were trying to sound\nlike a real drummer playing real drums, the 808, intentionally or not, turned that\nidea on its head\" (808 Statement)\n\nOf the preset sounds which made the 808 so distinctive, perhaps the most\nrecognizable is the bass drum. The TR-808 originally attempted to model an\nactual bass drum using a bridged T-network, essentially a resonant filter of sine\nwave feedback. However, the 808 gave the user control far outside the\nparameters of the analog bass drum thus creating an entirely new sound\n(Sigman). This sound, when amplified, created a loud \"boom\" which became a\nsignature of booty-shakin' rhythms.\n\nAs with most good technology, the TR-808 was soon overtaken by a\nnewer and shinier model. Although, \"The 808 was easy to use...the percussive\nsounds that came spurting out of the machine felt artificial and bizarre,\"\n(Richards) and thus the new model, the TR-909 was designed to sound more\nsimilar to analog drums. It was produced to compete with a newer version of the\nLinnDrum. As such, musicians clambering to get the latest technology, \"Dumped\ntheir TR-808s like yesterdays news, and many of them ended up in the hands of\nup-and-coming New York and Detroit dance and hip-hop producers\" (Sigman).\nMany of these new artists were able to use the kitsch of the 808 to their great\nadvantage. In fact, it would seem as if the 808 became even more popular\nposthumously, as hip hop grew into a more prevalent genre with the help of the\n808 sound. \"For a while, the trend was to program drum machines to sound as\nmuch as possible like a live drummer. Now much contemporary music that uses\nelectronic percussion has reverted to...using electronic rhythm as an alternative\nto a live drum kit, not an imitation of it\" (Brend 69).\nThus the 808 gained its fame in the late 1980s with the rise of hip hop. But\nlike neon sweatbands, big hair, and glam rock, artifacts of the decade quickly\nfaded away. This is exactly the reason why the 808 is so important. Instead of\nfading into yesteryear's hall of fame only to be recalled with a groan when Auntie\nCathy takes out the high school photo album, the 808 has in fact stayed the\ncourse. A quick search of eBay will reveal that used TR-808s, for Roland stopped\nproducing the units a mere four years after the first models rolled off the\nassembly line (Richards), sell for upwards of $2,000, which with inflation is equal\n\nto, or perhaps more, than they cost when brand new. This begets the question of\nwhat exactly modern 808 use is, and more importantly, whether or not it is still\nrelevant.\nThe answer to the question of relevance is a resounding yes. Indications\nof the continued popularity of the TR-808 are present in many facets of pop\nculture. The 808 still gets referenced in hip hop lyrics such as Atmosphere's cry\nto \"Give me more 808 and turn up the guitars,\" (\"Full Moon\") and even in pop\nmusic as Britney Spears' \"Heart [is] beating like an 808\" (\"Break the Ice\"),\nalthough as a disclaimer, it cannot be proven that Britney has ever actually seen\nan 808. Perhaps even more remarkable than the lyrical shout-outs to the 808, is\nthe number of software program which have been created to emulate its sounds\non the computer. These programs, aside from being simply fun to play around\nwith, are even more easy to obtain than the inexpensive, used 808s of the late\n80s pawnshop heyday. In fact, websites such as Hobnox.com even allow anyone\nwith internet access to lay down 808 beats free of charge. Therefore, the music\nworld has seen an increase of TR-808 presence from the bottom up, aptly\nsignaling that the TR-808 has indeed entered the 21st century, and that yes,\npeople are still interested.\n\nEven more indicative of the TR-808's continued relevance to music than a\nfew musical references and an unwavering army of computer savvy enthusiasts\nis its seamless integration into today's popular music. To illustrate this integration\none must consider the present, in which Kanye West is a household name. On\nNovember 24, 2008 Kanye released a new album called 808s and Heartbreak\n\n(Greenblatt). It is remarkable that nearly 30 years after the TR-808 was\nintroduced, it is still in use not only by nostalgic small bands playing coffee\nhouses and trying to harness that vintage feel, but also by the man, the legend,\nthe self proclaimed \"number one artist in the world\" (Rosen), Kanye West. The\nauthor reserves all commentary on personal opinion of Kanye's musical talent\nand ignores the mediocre, and in some cases glaringly awful, reviews which the\nalbum in question received but it cannot be denied that Kanye defines the\nmainstream and thus the 808 is still very much a part of it.\n\n808s and Heartbreak is not a title which merely namedrops the TR-808,\nbut rather actually uses it for rhythm on all of the album's 12 tracks (Rosen).\nAccording to album producer Mike Dean, \"Every song ha[d] to have an 808 in\nit...no typical hip-hop beats. They [had to] be tribal drums\" (qtd. in Shaheem\nReid) and Kanye himself states, \"I wanted my tracks to be minimal and\nfunctional. So like the function is the 808, the snare, and it gives you the groove.\nIt doesn't confuse your ear\" (\"Kanye West\"). In fact, according to many, it is these\n808 rhythms alone which save the album from sheer vocoder death at the hands\nof T-Pain.\n\"Love Lockdown,\" a single from 808s and Heartbreak, presents a prime\nexample of the use of 808 and in particular, its use to implement Kanye's\nminimalist idea. The track begins with the quintessential 808 bass drum in a duet\nwith a synthesized bass guitar backing Kanye's vocals. The 808's looping\ntechnique is put to good use here as the same rhythmic line repeats for the entire\nfront side of the song. Once the chorus comes in, the piece increases its groove\n\nby implementing a second 808 rhythm loop with a more \"tribal\" feel to it, and this\ntime featuring the unmistakable 808 snare. This bass line, simple and indeed\nminimalist in its repeated rhythms and easily distinguishable timbres, provides an\ninteresting addendum to the song. It perfectly fits the approach of electronic\ncreation, hallmarked here by the auto-tuned vocals, while still managing to not\nsound overly produced. Indeed, \"West, to his credit, manages to make the\nmachine's artificial throb sound both alien and pedestrian all at once,\" (Richards)\non \"Love Lockdown.\" Richards further goes on to say that \"Having adopted the\n808's heartbeat as our own, it's hard to tell what sounds fake and what sounds\nreal,\" in the song. Of course, the bass and the snare of the 808 still sound\nnothing like the originals, but in a world where virtually no sound from a radio is\nas it first came out of the instrument, the 808 fits in better than ever.\n\nThe TR-808 is everywhere. It is perhaps unnoticeable at first due to the\nfact that it fits perfectly into the fabric of popular music, but listen a little closer\nand its distinct sounds are unavoidable. The 808 has grown from a mediocre\nRoland product to a hot commodity on which pop artists are willing to spend\nthousands. Yet the TR-808 has managed to not become stale in its old age, but\nrather to flawlessly enter the computer age with software alternatives. It is the\nwillingness of the general public to savor the sounds of the 808 in today's popular\nmusic, exampled by Kanye's 808s and Heartbreak, which keeps the tradition\nalive. The Roland TR-808 is therefore indeed still relevant, and perhaps more\nimportantly in regards to its modest hip hop roots, the 808 is still in fact totally hip.\n\nWorks Cited\n\"808 Statement.\" Sound on Sound May 1997.

The most notable of these restrictions is its size, which is 2.4 in\n(62.1 mm) by 4.5 in (115.5 mm) by .48 in (12.3 mm)2 . To put this into perspective, this is\napproximately the size of a stack of a dozen note cards. Given this constraint of limited size,\nthe user interface becomes one of the most important design choices for developers. Some\nof these design choices for the user interface have proven successful, while others leave room\nfor improvement. This leads us to the question--How does one design a successful iPhone\ninstrument interface? To answer this, I first propose a couple criteria through which we\ncan analyze the efficacy and success of an iPhone instrument interface. Then, I explore the\nsensors and input devices that make up the iPhone interface. Finally, I provide a study of\nvarious iPhone instruments that have been developed, using the aforementioned criteria to\nevaluate their levels of success.\nDetermining the Efficacy of an iPhone Instrument\nInterface\nWhile the advent of the iPhone instrument is fairly new, user interface design is a challenge\nthat stretches back much further in human history. Thus, to answer the question of what\nmakes a good iPhone instrument interface, it helps to borrow a few ideas from the well-\nresearched field of user interface design. One of the golden books of user interface design is\n\"The Usability Engineering Lifecycle: A Practitioner's Handbook for User Interface Design,\"\nwritten by Deborah Mayhew. In this book, Mayhew states that the top two rules for a good\nuser interface is that it should be easy to learn to use and easy to use3 . To illustrate this\n1Diaz\n2Technical Specifications\n3Mayhew, 511\n\ndistinction, here are two examples. A Dvorak keyboard is hard to learn and easy to use, as\nit places more commonly used keys in easy-to-reach places, leading to an irregular layout.\nThis differs from a keyboard with keys laid out alphabetically, which would be easy to learn\n(key layout has a pattern) but difficult to use (letter frequency is disregarded). I propose\nease of use and ease of learnability as the two main criteria for analyzing iPhone instrument\ninterfaces. With these two metrics, I need to clarify what the term \"use\" entails when it\ncomes to iPhone instruments. To do this, I resort once again to Mayhew. One of the points\nthat Mayhew presents is that the use of an interface is dependent on its type of users4 . In\nour case, iPhone instruments have two main communities of users. The first is the larger\ngroup of casual amateurs, who use the application as a source of entertainment. The second\ngroup is composed of professionals who use these iPhone instruments for live performances\nand recordings. In the following two sections, I discuss the implications of these different\nuses with the two metrics.\n2.1\nEase of Learnability\nFor casual amateurs, ease of learnability is an important aspect because a hard-to-learn in\nterface leads to frustration, after which users give up. In the case of musical instruments,\none aspect in ease of learning is how quickly a user can learn how to produce an entertaining\nsound. Another aspect of learnability for amateurs may be the aesthetic of the application,\nwhich can serve to capture the user's interest and encourage the user to learn the interface.\nFor professionals, ease of learnability is less important, as they may be more willing to spend\nmore time and effort learning the interface. This being said, professionals are more likely to\naccept an interface that is easy to learn.\nTo go about creating an interface that is easy to learn, the simple solution is to develop\na very simple interface with few controls. To implement a more complicated interface suc\ncessfully, one can exploit the users' previous knowledge by developing an interface that is\n4Mayhew, 1\n\nsimilar to an already-popular interface. One example of using such a real-world metaphor is\npresented by Theo Mandel in his book, \"The Elements of User Interface Design\". Mandel\ndescribes his computer-based telephone system, which has a graphical interface that\n...looks like a telephone answering machine! It didn't take me [Mandel] very long\nat all to figure out how to use the telephone answering system. I [Mandel] didn't\neven have to look at the brief documentation that came with the product.5\nIn a later section of the paper, we will see that many of the current iPhone instruments use\nthis idea of creating a real-world metaphor by emulating existing instruments.\n2.2\nEase of Use\nEase of use for amateurs is defined by the ease with which the user can produce entertaining\nsounds and rhythms. For professionals, who use these instruments in performance, ease of\nuse is determined by the ease with which they can produce intended sounds quickly and\nreliably. Reliability also includes repeatability, in the case of rehearsal-based performances\n(that is, not improvisational). Two factors that affect speed and reliability are the mapping of\nmusical parameters, discussed in part below under \"Strict and Relaxed Musical Parameters\",\nand the resolution of the various input devices used in the interface, discussed later.\n2.3\nStrict and Relaxed Musical Parameters\nHere, I present the terminology of strict and relaxed parameters, which are distinguished\nby the following. A difference in a strict parameter between two performances of the same\ncomposition would concern and be noticed by the audience, while a difference in a relaxed\nparameter would not necessarily be noticed or concerning. For instance, pitch is a strict\nparameter in that if a performer plays a D sharp at the beginning of Bach's Violin Sonata\n5Mandel, Chap. 5, pg 18\n\n#2 Fuga (which begins with a D), an audience would definitely notice and be concerned.\nAn example of a relaxed parameter would be volume--if a performer began playing a piece\nin pp as opposed to p, an audience may not notice and/or care. For this discussion, the\nimportant distinction between strict and relaxed parameters is that strict parameters need\nto be more reliable than relaxed parameters.\niPhone: More than just a graphical interface.\nWhen one hears the term \"user interface,\" one commonly resorts to the notion of a graphical\nuser interface. In this paper, however, we will consider all forms of input, graphical or not,\nas part of the user interface. This is especially important when considering the iPhone,\nas it houses many sensors and input devices, including a touch screen, a microphone, an\naccelerometer, a magnetometer, and a camera. In each of the following sections, I explore\nthe technical details of each sensor, as well any associated musical metrics.\n3.1\nTouch Screen\nPhysically, the touch screen is the largest sensor in the iPhone. It is placed on top of the LCD\ndisplay layers, spanning 3.5 inches diagonally.6,7 It monitors changes in electrical current,\nallowing it to track multiple touches from the user.8 Through experimentation, I have found\nthat the touch screen can track up to a maximum of five touches simultaneously. From a\npractical standpoint, however, it must be noted that using more than three fingers at a given\ntime makes it difficult for the user to see the screen.\nOne of the important details of the touch screen is the resolution of touches. That is,\nhow precise are users' touches? For the developer, the precision of the touch inputs are\n6Wilson\n7\"Tech Slavior\"\n8Wilson\n\ngiven to the nearest pixel of the center of the touch. However, users cannot generally work\nwith this level of precision, especially if they are using their fingers. More practically, if we\nassume the width of the average finger to be about 1 cm, then interface elements (such as\nbuttons) should be no smaller than 1 cm9 . This means that the iPhone's 5 cm x 7.5 cm\nscreen has a practical resolution of approximately 5 x 7 touches. These measurements are\nrelevant to both discrete interface elements (buttons) and continuous elements (sliders), with\ndifferent implications, as discussed below.\n3.1.1\nDiscrete Elements\nDiscrete elements inherently reduce the malicious effects of a misplaced touch by allowing for\nall touches within a certain range to map to a single input. So, as long as discrete elements\nare large enough (specifically, at least 1 cm x 1 cm), they are very reliable. This means\nthat such discrete elements are effective at mapping to strict parameters, such as pitch.\nHowever, the practical resolution suggests that only 5 elements should be placed width-wise\nand 7 elements height-wise. In the case that an interface maps one button to one pitch, this\nsuggests that we can only have 7 pitches if we use one dimension. This is pitiful, considering\nthat even an octave on the piano includes 8 white notes. There are solutions to this challenge\nof limited space such as using combinations of buttons to determine notes, which is discussed\nin detail later in the section regarding Smule's Ocarina.\n3.1.2\nContinuous Elements\nContinuous elements are interesting because their inputs can be continuous or discretized\nusing a filter. To obtain the same level of reliability as a discrete element, multiple touches\nneed to be mapped to a single input; that is, the inputs need to be discretized. If we do\nthis, the practical resolution suggests that a slider that is N cm long should have at most\nN discrete values. Akin to the discrete elements, this leads to a maximum of 7 pitches\n9Kewaley, 4-5\n\non one slider. If we don't discretize the inputs, we end up with less reliability. However,\nthese continuous inputs map to relaxed musical parameters effectively, as relaxed musical\nparameters are more accepting of continuous inputs' inherently lower level of reliability.\nContinuous elements can also easily account for musical parameters that are not perceived\nlinearly by the human ear. For instance, amplitude of a sound is perceived by the human ear\non a logarithmic scale. This means that if one were to use a linear scale on the continuous\nslider normalized from 0 to 1, there would be a much greater difference in going from 0 to\n.5 than from .5 to 1. One can easily resolve this problem by implementing a fourth power-\nfunction (x4) scale for the continuous inputs, which allows the ear to perceive the change in\nvolume to be linear. Given the lower reliability and the ability to account for non-linearity,\nnon-discretized elements are effective when mapped to relaxed musical parameters.\n3.2\nMicrophone\nThe iPhone has a built-in microphone, which can pick up in a range from 30dB to approxi\nmately up to 105dB and in the newest model, has a frequency range of 100 to 19000 Hz.10\nThis is fairly close to the range of human hearing, which is 20-20000 Hz11 and includes all of\nthe typical human vocal range, which ranges from 100-1000 Hz.12 It is interesting to consider\nthe mappings of these two input parameters, frequency and amplitude, discussed below.\n3.2.1\nInput Parameter One: Frequency\nIt must be noted that the input \"frequency\" is actually a collection of frequencies (the input\nis unlikely to be a perfect sine tone), which may need to be processed if being used as an\ninput for uses other than recording. It is difficult to imagine frequency input being mapped\nto something other than frequency, especially if the iPhone instrument's output is in real\ntime. However, when it comes to mapping an input to frequency, the frequencies from the\n10faberacoustical\n11Bullock, 85\n12Luciani, 149\n\nmicrophone are very effective in that what you hear is what you get. Assuming a continuous\ninput, reliability of this input is determined by the user's voice, which may or may not be\nreliable. Later in this paper, I will discuss the application \"I Am T-Pain\" that discretizes\nthe input for greater reliability and entertainment.\n3.2.2\nInput Parameter Two: Amplitude\nAs mentioned earlier, the input amplitude ranges from 30dB to approximately 105dB. The\nmicrophone returns values in dBFS ranging from -60 dBFS to 0 dBFS, which can be converted\nto a normalized linear scale ranging from 0 to 1.0, with values containing precision to the\nthousandth's place. This precision is a faux-precision, however. That is, it is difficult for users\nto work with such precision. Thus, I attempted to determine a more practical resolution by\nexperimentally blowing into the device and attempting to \"hold\" an amplitude of 0.5 on the\nnormalized linear scale. Specifically, I ran the SpeakHere app, which displays the amplitude\nlevel, and blew into the microphone while trying to maintain the amplitude level at the\ncenter. Through logging the results over a period of three seconds, I found that the inputs\nranged from 0.4 to 0.6 on the normalized linear scale. Assuming that I am an average user,\nthis means that the practical resolution of the amplitude input is 0.2 out of a total range\nof 1.0. Thus, this input would only be reliable if it were discretized into a maximum of five\ndiscrete values. This limited range in a discretized situation implies that this input is more\nsuited for continuous inputs and lower reliability-situations--that is, relaxed parameters.\nThis is not hard to believe, given that amplitude input from the microphone is designed to\nbe mapped to amplitude, which is a relaxed parameter.\n3.3\nAccelerometer\nThe iPhone accelerometer returns values as follows--if one were to tie a brick to a string and\nattach it to the center of the bottom surface, the accelerometer would report the direction of\n\nthe string relative to the device (ie, the direction of gravity) and the strength of force in that\ndirection. For the developer, the accelerometer returns values in terms of the g-force. That\nis, the force of gravity is 1.0G. By shaking the device, I was able to produce magnitudes\nof up to approximately 2.2G. Forces with magnitudes above 1G are not sustainable in a\npractical manner, while forces less than 1G can be sustained by changing the direction of\ngravity relative to the device; that is, by rotating the device. Therefore, to determine a\npractical resolution, I assume that the range is from -1.0G to 1.0G. It is important to note\nthat this range is 180*, not a full circle, as all values (except 1.0G and -1.0G) are repeated\non the circle. By using the AccelerometerGraph app, I experimentally determined that I\ncould hold a given g-force at ¬± 0.02G. By adding a low-pass filter, I was able to hold at\n¬± 0.01G. Using our range of -1.0G to 1.0G and practical resolution of 0.02G alone, one\ncould theoretically discretize this continuous input into 100 discrete values, which is more\nthan any other input device thus far. However, this resolution is challenged when we want\nto make this input reliable. One of the main notions of reliability is the aspect of quick\nrepeatability. For instance, could one play a melody, put down the iPhone, pick it back\nup, and play the melody again? Given a randomly generated g-force value, I was only able\nto point the iPhone at the given direction ¬± 0.15G. This produces a big difference in our\npractical resolution, bringing the theoretically 100 discrete values down to approximately\n613 . This new estimate of the practical resolution is within the same range as the previously\nmentioned inputs (the touch screen and the microphone). To increase the resolution, one\ncould theoretically have a display that notifies the user of the current g-force value. While\nslow, this could allow for more accurate repeatability. However, the accelerometer is plagued\nwith the challenge that the input value is directly associated with the rotational position\nof the device. In some of these positions, the display is either in a confusing position (at\na diagonal) or has low visibility (facing the other direction). This suggests that using the\ndisplay in conjunction with the accelerometer is difficult when using the full range of the\naccelerometer. In conclusion, the accelerometer can reliably produce 6 discrete values, which\n13This is interesting, as six is half of the number of hours on a clock, suggesting that either my previous\nknowledge of clocks led to this value, or the number of hours on a clock was determined by an inherent desire\nfor this specific spacing.\n\ncan be mapped to a strict parameter, or can produce continuous input that can be mapped\nto a relaxed parameter.\n3.4\nMagnetometer\nIn the newer versions of the iPhone, a magnetometer is included. Essentially, a magne\ntometer is a digital compass. So, this sensor returns readings about a surrounding magnetic\nfield. The developer can grab the current heading of the device (from 0* to 360*), to an\naccuracy of about ¬± 2*. So, the practical resolution for the magnetometer before taking into\naccount repeatability is about 4*, leading to 90 discrete values. Once we take repeatability\ninto account, we can use our previous analysis for the accelerometer to determine that the\npractical resolution of the magnetometer drops down to about 30*, or about 12 discrete val\nues. This value is double the number of discrete values for the accelerometer as it has a full\n360* range, in comparison to the 180* range of the accelerometer. 12 discrete values is the\nmost we have seen for any input (except perhaps the frequency input of the microphone),\nbut the range of motion required to produce these values forces the user to turn the device\naround a full 360*, which is an awkward motion without extra props (such as a spinning\nplate or a turntable). As a result, the magnetometer can produce 12 discrete values, some\nof which may lack ease of use, or can produce continuous input to be mapped to a relaxed\nparameter. Along with the current heading, the magnetometer can also return the strength\nof the surrounding magnetic field, returned in microTeslas. For fear of destroying my device,\nI did not perform any experiments involving a magnet to determine the resolution of this\ninput. However, it is definitely conceivable that such an input could be mapped to pitch,\nleading to a theremin-like device.\n\n3.5\nCamera\nThe iPhone hosts a 2 megapixel camera facing in the opposite direction of the touch screen.14\nThe developer can access the camera and take images and videos, which can then be pro\ncessed. Theoretically, this could be used as an input device for an instrument. However,\nthis is difficult to use in real-time, as the images can only be acquired at a rate of about one\nper three seconds and the video must be recorded before it can be analyzed. Also, images\nand videos taken with the camera are very unreliable, as they are affected greatly by the\nsurrounding environment. While this unreliability and difficulty of real-time use would make\nthis input unfit for professionals, it is conceivable that the camera may be used as an input\nsource for amateur entertainment. For instance, each pixel of a user's image has red, green,\nand blue values ranging from 0 to 255 each that may be mapped to three separate parameters\nlike pitch, amplitude, and timbre. Then, each pixel can be played in order from left to right,\ntop to bottom, leading to a composition derived from the image. In this example, the input\nis essentially a continuous input that has been discretized to values from 0 to 255.\niPhone Instruments: What works and what doesn't.\nSince the release of the iPhone App Store, there have been many iPhone instruments. Some\nof these have great interfaces while others leave room for improvement. In the following\nsections, I present a discussion on a selection of these various iPhone instruments. Putting\nthe proposed criteria into action, the two main questions that I ask about each instrument\nare \"Is it easy to learn?\" and \"Is it easy to use?\"\n14Carr\n\n4.1\nMiniPiano\nThe MiniPiano is essentially a keyboard interface applied to the iPhone. It places an image\nof a keyboard on the screen and uses the multi-touch capabilities of the touch screen to\nemulate pressing of keys, of up to five keys.\n4.1.1\nEase of Learnability - A Real-world Metaphor\nThe MiniPiano is perhaps the champion when it comes to ease of learnability. Not only is\nthe interface very simple, it also uses the real-world metaphor of a piano. This makes it\neasy to learn for amateurs and professionals alike. However, in trying to emulate a large\ninstrument such as the piano in such a small device, we see that there is a trade-off in the\nease of use.\n4.1.2\nEase of Use\nOne of the concerns related with the MiniPiano interface is that a large interface (a grand\npiano has 88 keys) is shrunk to the size of the iPhone, limiting the number of keys to 14.15,16\nThe width of each key is approximately 1 cm, so the reliability of this interface is conserved.\nHowever, the number of notes that can be played is very limited (less than an octave), which\nmakes this interface difficult to use in a practical setting. As a solution, developers of the\napplication have added a second row of keys which doubles the note range. Unfortunately,\nthis not only makes the keys smaller, but also decreases the ease of learnability, as most\nusers are not acquainted with multiply-layered pianos. Another interesting remedy to the\nchallenge of limited notes has been to use multiple iPhones, lined up next to each other.17\nAlthough this may be a creative solution, it is very expensive. Given the lack of a true\nsolution to the problem of trying to shrink the piano into the iPhone, this interface, while\n15The Piano\n16TopTenREVIEWS - MiniPiano 2009\n17iPhone Piano\n\neasy to learn, is not easy to use.\n4.2\nPocket Guitar\nAt the time of this writing, the pocket guitar is the seventh most popular paid music app.18\nAs the name implies, it follows an interface close to that of a guitar. This application shows\nseveral strings on the screen and uses the multiple touch interface to detect fingers \"holding\ndown\" frets, as well as \"strums\" and \"plucks\".19 This interface also suffers from the same\nchallenge as the MiniPiano in that it attempts to shrink a larger interface.\n4.2.1\nEase of Learnability\nWith regard to ease of learnability, Pocket Guitar, like the MiniPiano, benefits from a real-\nworld metaphor. Unlike the MiniPiano, the Pocket Guitar is only easy to learn if the user\nhas previous experience with the real-world object. One user's recount of his experience with\nthe Pocket Guitar illustrates this point.\nI had never even touched a guitar outside of picking up my friend's \"axe\" (as\nthe cool kids call them), strumming a few off-key strings, and promptly putting it\ndown. I quickly found that Pocket Guitar's developers did such an accurate job\nrecreating the guitar experience on the iPhone that I sounded just as horrible on\nit as on a real guitar.20\nFrom this we see that an interface does not become easy to learn by simply using a real-world\nmetaphor. The more well-known the real-world object is, the more likely the interface is easy\nto learn.\n18Top 50 Paid Music Apps\n19PocketGuitar Review\n20macenstein\n\n4.2.2\nEase of Use\nThe Pocket Guitar suffers from the issue of not being able to emulate all of the notes on\na real guitar. This is caused not only by the limited size of the iPhone, which only allows\nfor a portion of the guitar to be visible, but is also limited by the number of touches the\niPhone can handle. As the touch screen can only track up to five touches, the maximum\nnumber of frets that can be held down is four (one finger is needed to strum). On top of\nthis, for chords with four fingers, the device becomes very difficult to hold. On a real guitar,\nthe instrument is supported by the performer's thigh, arm, and/or a strap, so support is\nnot an issue. With a hand-held device like the iPhone, the instrument is supported by the\nhand that is either holding down the frets or the hand strumming the notes, both of which\nis difficult. One solution to this is to place the iPhone on a flat surface and play it more like\na koto. That is, hold down the frets with one hand as if playing the piano and strum the\nnotes with the other hand in the same \"piano position.\" While this leads to easier use, this\nleads to a harder-to-learn interface, which is undesirable. The Pocket Guitar is relatively\neasy to learn, especially with previous guitar experience, but is very difficult to use.\n4.3\nOcarina\nAt the time of this writing, Smule's Ocarina is the sixth most popular paid music app21 . This\ninstrument, modeled after the ocarina, uses four buttons whose combination determines the\npitch and the microphone's input amplitude to determine the amplitude of the instrument.\n4.3.1\nEase of Learnability\nAs with the MiniPiano and the Pocket Guitar, the Ocarina uses a real-world metaphor.\nWhile users may have less experience with the ocarina than with a guitar, the interface is\nvery simple (four buttons), which makes the ocarina easier to learn. Musical scores for the\n21Top 50 Paid Music Apps\n\nocarina exist that show which holes should be covered; this allows users to learn and play\nsongs very easily.\n4.3.2\nEase of Use\nThe difference between the Ocarina and the MiniPiano/Pocket Guitar lies in its choice to\nemulate a small instrument. As founder of Smule, Ge Wang, writes,\nWe wanted to create an expressive musical instrument. However, instead of tak\ning a larger instrument (e.g., a guitar or a piano) and \"shrinking\" the experience\ninto a small mobile device, we started with a small and simple instrument, the\nocarina (more specifically, the 4 hole English Pendant ocarina), and fleshed it out\nonto the form factor of the iPhone.22\nThis idea of emulating small and simple historical instruments is very successful. As the em\nulated instrument fits well onto the iPhone, no notes are lost in the emulation process. The\nOcarina also manages the interface's real estate very well by using combination of button\npresses to determine a note. Previously, we assumed that one button would be mapped to\none pitch, as in the MiniPiano, which gives a range of N pitches for N buttons. However,\nusing combinations of buttons, we get a much greater range of 2N pitches for N buttons.\nWith the Ocarina, which uses 4 buttons, we get a range of 16 notes, which is 4 times the\nnumber of values a one-button, one-pitch interface would have.\nWhile other applications use the microphone to record sounds, Ocarina uses the micro\nphone to determine when the user is blowing on the device. Specifically, the amplitude of\nthe input (the breath) is mapped directly to the amplitude of the resulting note. 23\n22Wang\n23Wang\n\n4.4\nBebot\nBebot is an interesting application that uses up to four simultaneous touch locations to\ndetermine pitch, timbre, and/or volume of the sound.\n4.4.1\nEase of Learnability - Progressive Disclosure\nWhile Bebot does not use a real-world metaphor like the MiniPiano or Ocarina, it still has a\nvery simple and easy-to-learn interface. This is in part due to its use of a technique known\nas \"progressive disclosure.\" As Mandel writes,\nUsers should not be overwhelmed by what they can do in a product. You don't\nneed to show users all of the functions the product offers. The best way to teach\nand guide users is to show them what they need, when they need it, and where\nthey want it. This is the concept of progressive disclosure.24\nBebot exemplifies progressive disclosure by providing the novice user with a starting screen\nthat is very simple--touching the screen produces a sound. Bebot does an excellent job of\nallowing a novice user to quickly produce an entertaining sound. Continuing with the concept\nof progressive disclosure, Bebot allows curious users to pull up a secondary panel which has\nthe option of loading other preset values for the timbre. Changing between these values is\nas simple as pressing a button and provides even more entertainment for the user. The next\nlevel of disclosure is revealed when a user decides to explore Saving Presets, Synth Controls,\nEffects, and Scale, which bring up more panels with numerous options. If the interface were\nto display all of these options to the novice user, the user would be overwhelmed and may\ngive up learning the interface. However, through progressive disclosure, Bebot effectively\nallows for very easy learnability.\n24Mandel, Chap. 5, pg 20\n\n4.4.2\nEase of Use\nBebot uses the whole touch screen as an input device, mapping the two axes to two different\nmusical parameters. In particular, the longer axis is mapped to pitch. Bebop allows the user\nto select the pitches to be either discretized or continuous. In the discretized scenario, we\nknow that to ensure reliability, seven is the optimal maximum number of discrete values to\nuse on this axis. To increase ease of use, Bebot provides the option to toggle a note grid\nthat shows where notes are and an option to control the range of pitches covered by the\naxis, ranging from one octave to almost six octaves. For reliability, a more focused range is\nmore optimal--so to determine if Bebot is reliable, this discussion focuses on the range of\none octave. For one octave, about 14 discrete values are required, which is about 0.5 cm per\nvalue. While this breaks the rule of at least 1 cm per value, it should be noted that Apple\nalso breaks this rule. In the standard iPhone keyboard, keys are allotted 0.5 cm in portrait\nmode25 . This being said, the iPhone keyboard is \"intelligent\" in that it provides a visual\nconfirmation of each letter as it is typed, uses pattern recognition of common sequences of\nletters, uses a dictionary, and has adaptive button sizes--that is, each button's hit area is\ndetermined by predicting the next letter to be typed26 . Bebop is unable to be \"intelligent\"\nin any of these fashions, due to its inherent logistics. Specifically, notes in a composition\ndo not necessarily follow a pattern so it is fairly unreasonable to use pattern recognition or\nadaptive button sizes. Visual confirmation and use of a dictionary assume that the output\noccurs when a touch is released, not when a touch begins. As Bebop produces sound when\na touch begins, visual confirmation and use of a \"dictionary\" are not possible. Thus, Bebop\ndoes not have the most reliable of interfaces, as it only allots 0.5 cm per discrete value\nwithout any \"intelligence.\" This being said, it seems that while difficult, this interface could\nbe and is used by professionals like Jordan Rudess27 . This may be due to the improv-like\nstyle of Rudess, which might not require repeatability to the extent that a rehearse-based\nperformance would.\n25Kewaley, 5\n26Kewaley, 5-6\n27Synthtopia\n\n4.5\nCosmovox\nCosmovox has several timbres whose pitches can be controlled through various movements\nof the device detected by the accelerometer.\n4.5.1\nEase of Learnability\nCosmovox, like Bebot, does not use a real-world metaphor. With regards to how quickly a\nuser can make an entertaining sound, Cosmovox does a very good job--sound is output con\ntinuously when performance mode is selected (which is automatically selected). Cosmovox\nuses a two-step version of progressive disclosure that increases ease of learnability. While\nnovice users can produce sounds immediately in performance mode, more curious users can\nalter options such as the range, fundamental, portamento, modulation, feedback, vibrato,\nand more. In comparison to Bebot, Cosmovox uses fewer levels of progressive disclosure,\nwhich makes ease of learning more difficult.\n4.5.2\nEase of Use\nCosmovox relies solely on the use of the accelerometer for input, which is very unreliable,\nas seen in the previous section on the accelerometer. Cosmovox allows for continuous input\nas well as inputs discretized to notes in a scale, using preset scales such as Major, Minor,\nPentatonic, etc. This idea of discretizing inputs to a scale is highly beneficial. A scale is the\nsubset of notes in the entire octave (assuming the scale is not chromatic). By discretizing\ninputs to notes in a scale, unused notes are excluded from the mapping. This increases\nthe range of the notes mapped by the discrete values almost two-fold (for instance, two\noctaves in the place of one). Increasing this range improves the usability of this interface\nfor professionals. Like Bebot's ability to control the range of pitches covered by the axis,\nCosmovox allows the user to change the range of notes mapped by the accelerometer's input\nvalues. Given this, it is important to note that as the accelerometer maps reliably to a\n\nmaximum of 6 discrete values, having more than one octave of a scale (8 notes) mapped by\nthe accelerometer leads to a fairly unreliable interface. One pitfall of the Cosmovox interface\nis that to transition between two notes, all of the other notes in between must be played,\ndue to the inherent continuity of the accelerometer. In conclusion, professionals may be able\nto use Cosmovox, as long as they don't need a large range of notes and don't mind playing\ntransition notes.\n4.6\nI Am T-Pain\nI Am T-Pain is an application by Smule that makes use of auto-tune. In effect, auto-tune\nmaps input frequencies from the microphone to discretized pitches on a scale, much like\nCosmovox.\n4.6.1\nEase of Learnability - Aesthetic Value\nTo create an entertaining sound using I Am T-Pain, the user simply has to sing into the\nmicrophone. As such, the interface is very easy to learn. On top of this simple method\nof user input, I Am T-Pain improves upon learnability by using a graphical interface that\ncontains aesthetic values designed specifically for the user. For instance, the title \"I Am\nT-Pain\" is in shiny gold \"bling\" and there are images of T-Pain that subconsciously and/or\nconsciously motivate the user to want to learn to be like T-Pain. While this motivation\ndoes not necessarily make the interface easer to learn, it does make the user more interested,\nwhich leads to faster learning.\n4.6.2\nEase of Use\nAuto-tune is designed to make singing easier and as a direct result, I Am T-Pain is very\neasy to use. Due to the discretization that takes place, the reliability is greater than that\n\nof the user's voice alone. The usable range of notes is not limited by the resolution of the\ninput device. Instead, the usable range of notes is only limited by the range of notes of the\nuser's voice. This dependency on the user's voice suggests that if the user has a very weak\nor otherwise hard-to-use voice, then this interface may be hard to use. However, for the\naverage user, I Am T-Pain has an easy-to-use interface.\niPhone in Music: Conclusion\nWhat makes an iPhone instrument interface successful? Through the exploration of user\ninterface design, the quick answer was that an interface that is easy to learn and easy to use\nwill be a successful interface. To answer the question of how to design such an interface on the\niPhone, this paper studied and experimented with various iPhone sensors in depth to arrive\nat effective mappings between input devices and musical parameters. Finally, the paper\ncritiqued current iPhone instruments, touching upon beneficial ideas such as the use of real-\nworld metaphors, progressive disclosure, and aesthetic value. Whether you're a developer\ntrying to develop the next best-selling app or a professional musician creating a new personal\niPhone instrument, the explorations and ideas in this paper should be a valuable resource\nthat guides the way to a successful iPhone instrument interface.\n\nReferences\n[1] Bullock, John, Joseph Boyle, and Michael Wang.

      "content": "Anonymous MIT student\nProfessor Ariza\n21M.380\n2 December 2009\nA Breath-Controlled Arduino Theremin: The Airemino\nThe Theremin (or Thereminovox) is traditionally a continuously sounding, monophonic\ninstrument controlled by moving one's hands through free space in proximity to two antennae -\none that controls the frequency of the generated sound and another that controls its amplitude. It\nwas originally designed in the 1920s by Russian electrical engineer Lev Sergeyevich Termen as\nan extension of his work on a security system that involved sensing the presence of humans by\ndetecting fluctuations in radio signals. The Theremin is one of the few instruments that receives\ninput from the musician without requiring any physical contact, in addition to the modern laser\nharp.\nIn order to control the pitch of the Theremin, the musician adjusts the position of his\nfingers in free space to change the apparent capacitance of the frequency sense antenna, which\ndetermines the natural frequency at which an inductor-capacitor (LC) oscillator will resonate.\nThe output signal of this variable frequency LC oscillator is then mixed (multiplied) with the\noutput signal of a fixed frequency LC oscillator, whose resonant frequency is equal to the\nresonant frequency of the variable oscillator when the antenna is in isolation (no human hand\npresent). The mixing operation outputs two signals, one with frequency equal to the sum of the\ntwo input frequencies and one with frequency equal to the difference. A simple low-pass filter\nwill eliminate the sum frequency and leave only the difference, or \"beat\" frequency.\n\nThe signal processing technique described above is called heterodyning and is of great\nvalue to the original analog Theremin because it transforms minute fluctuations in capacitance\n(due to hand motion) into audible frequencies. Consider the case where the fixed oscillator rings\nat 1 MHz and the variable oscillator fluctuates around 1 MHz, by only 0.1%, due to hand motion.\nIf we subtract 1 MHz from 1.001 MHz, we are left with 1 kHz, which is indeed in the audible\nrange. To sweep the entire audible range, the frequency of the variable oscillator must fluctuate\nby only 0.2%. Although the original analog Theremin design delivers the classic Theremin sound\nin the most pure sense, building one can make for an entire semester long project. Building an\noscillator that is stable enough for the small frequency fluctuations to be significant (frequency\ndrift must be less than 0.001% for 10 Hz resolution in the example described above) requires\nvery low-tolerance components with little temperature dependence. Additionally, the\nheterodyning process is difficult to implement in analog electronics and would be error-prone for\nthe novice. However, despite the difficulty inherent to building an analog Theremin, it is possible\nto transform the underlying principles on which the Theremin operates into the digital domain\nwhere they can be dealt with easily. This is exactly the approach that Martin Nawrath took in his\narticle \"Arduino + Theremin = Theremino\"1 in the November 2009 issue of Elektor Magazine.\nNawrath preserves the capacitive sense pitch control aspect of the Theremin, but instead\nof using an analog oscillator with heterodyning circuitry, he uses a digital oscillator and a\nfrequency counter implemented in software on the Arduino platform (AVR microcontroller) to\ndetect the small changes in frequency due to changes in antenna capacitance. The digital\noscillator is built using an LC tank oscillator with resonant frequency 4.1 MHz, as well as four\n1 \"Arduino + Theremin = Theremino\", by Martin Nawrath (Academy of Media Arts, Cologne, Germany), Elektor\nMagazine, Volume 1, Issue 11, pp. 32-35 (2009).\n\nNAND gates with the appropriate resistive/capacitive feedback to allow for oscillation. An\nantenna is added in parallel with the LC tank oscillator just like in the original analog Theremin\ndesign. A square wave of frequency 4.1 MHz ¬± Œîf (in which Œîf is the small frequency variation\ndue to hand position) appears at the output of the oscillator, and can be connected directly to one\nof the Arduino's digital inputs since it is a digital signal. A schematic of Nawrath's variable\nfrequency square wave oscillator is shown below.\nThe software on the Arduino board performs a few simple interrupt driven tasks to\ndetermine the minute fluctuations in oscillator frequency. Two hardware counter/timers are\nutilized, 16-bit Timer/Counter1 and 8-bit Timer/Counter2. Timer/Counter2 functions as a simple\n100 ms timer, and during each 100 ms period Timer/Counter1 counts the number of transitions\non the digital input pin connected to the square wave oscillator. The number of transitions\nobserved in a 100 ms time window can be used to infer relative fluctuations in oscillator\nfrequency, by first measuring the number of transitions in the 100 ms time window after the\nTheremin is turned on (assuming that a human hand is not present initially) and using this value\nas a baseline. Bringing an object into range of the antenna will change its capacitance slightly,\nleading to a variation in oscillator frequency and a different transition count. The difference\n\nbetween this transition count and the baseline can be used to adjust the frequency of a simple\nsquare wave tone generated on one of the Arduino's digital outputs. In the end, the software is\nresponsible for mapping a small frequency fluctuation in the oscillator's digital output to an\naudible pitch.\nNawrath's implementation of the digital Theremin works considerably well for discretely\ncontrolling the pitch of a generated square wave, but it lacks the functionality of amplitude\ncontrol that was available in the original analog Theremin. Volume control in an analog\nTheremin works exactly the same way as frequency control, except rather than being played\ndirectly, a band-pass filter is applied to the beat frequency of the fixed and variable oscillators,\noutputting a signal whose amplitude varies depending on hand position. By passing this signal\nthrough an envelope tracker and using the envelope as the control voltage for a VCA (voltage\ncontrolled amplifier), it is possible to control the volume of the Theremin's audio output.\nSince it would require some type of digital to analog converter to adjust the amplitude of\nthe generated square wave on the Arduino (a clumsy R2R ladder perhaps), we can instead\nsacrifice the ability to control dynamics for simplicity in hardware and settle for a binary means\nof controlling the amplitude of the audio output by simply turning it on and off based on some\nform of user input (be it an additional oscillator/frequency counter or something else). A simple\nbutton would work for this purpose and would allow the musician to articulate rhythms by\ndepressing and releasing the button while still controlling the pitch of the generated tone with\nhand position. However, in the spirit of making the Theremin resemblant of actual musical\ninstruments, we can add an exciting twist to the Theremino's musical interface by switching on\nand off the audio output by means of a breath controller, thereby transforming it into an\n\nAiremino.\nThe simple breath controller in the Airemino works as follows. An active high-pass filter\n(with gain of 2 dB at high frequencies2) is applied to the output of an electret microphone. This\nactive high-pass filter is identical to the inverting amplifier op-amp configuration, but with the\naddition of an AC-coupling capacitor in between the electret microphone's output and the\ninverting amplifier. The AC-coupling capacitor is necessary to eliminate the electret\nmicrophone's DC bias voltage and pass only the time-varying component of its output signal.\nThis time-varying signal is then amplified by the inverting amplifier and fed into an envelope\ntracker, composed of a diode and a parallel RC circuit. The voltage across the resistor and the\ncapacitor follows the envelope of the audio signal coming from the microphone, which is then\nused as a control voltage for the Arduino's audio output. A schematic of the breath controller is\nshown below.\nThe active high-pass filter must have a gain of 2 dB at high frequencies since the electret\nmicrophone tends to output audio signals with maximum amplitude around 50 mV (about the DC\nbias). The 2 dB gain boosts this maximum amplitude to around 5 V, enabling the envelope\nIn this case we are not concerned with the low frequency components of the electret microphone's audio output signal since\nthe musician will be blowing into the microphone. Attenuating the low frequencies in this white noise input will not affect the\nfinal result; however, if we were instead interested in sampling an acoustic waveform (like speech or some other sound) the\ncut-off frequency of the high-pass filter would need to be tuned to our range of interest.\n\ntracker to produce a control voltage between GND (0 V) and VCC (5 V) that can be read into the\nArduino's ADC (analog to digital converter) and thresholded to determine whether to output\naudio or not.\nAll in all, the addition of the breath controller allows for the articulation of rhythms in a\nway that is familiar to woodwind musicians, while the capacitive sense pitch controller provides\npitch selection in a way that is familiar to string musicians. When combined, these two musical\ninterfaces allow for real unique opportunity in shaping sounds that is unavailable in most\nconventional instruments. Below are several pictures of the final implementation of the\nAiremino.\nSeen from the front.\n\nSeen from the top.\nNawrath's Variable Frequency Digital Oscillator\nHomebrew Breath Controller\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n21M.380 Music and Technology (Contemporary History and Aesthetics)\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Anonymous MIT student\n2009-12-04\nProf. Chirstopher Ariza\n21M.380\nSonic System Project\nApproximating Acoustics with Convolution\nThe purpose of this project is to design and implement a software Sonic System that\ncould effectively model the acoustics of a room. This is carried out by using several special\nproperties of sound and acoustic systems, which facilitate the intense computation associated\nwith such tasks. The project was implemented in Java and uses the Java Sound back-end in order\nto access audio streams such as speakers, microphones, and software mixers.\nThe motivations behind this project were numerous. The major aesthetic motivator was\nthe experimental piece \"I'm Sitting in a Room,\" by Alvin Lucier. This piece was generated as\nfollows: Lucier spoke into a microphone and recorded his voice. He then positioned the\nmicrophone in a certain way and recorded the playback of his voice, which also captured his\nacoustics. Over time, these acoustics would cause several aspects of his voice to fade and would\namplify others. Eventually, the recording converges to a smooth, rich tone, which I find very\naesthetically appealing. Since then, I have been thinking of ways to simulate that process\ncomputationally, which could incredibly speed up the process by which Lucier arrived at his new\nsound.\nThe principles by which this is carried out through software are all founded on the\nbreathtaking linearity of sound systems such as rooms. Because sound travels at a near-constant\nvelocity, independent of frequency, to good approximation, any acoustic system without much\n\nnoise can be approximated as a Linear, Time-Invariant System (LTI).\nA remarkable property of these systems is that in emitting a unit sample (a sample whose\namplitude-time product is 1) and observing the response to such an input, one can extend these\nobservations and predict a system's outputs given other inputs. The method by which this is\ncalculated is called convolution, which is defined as follows: the sum from negative infinity to\ninfinity, of one function sampled at the iterative index, times another function at the absolute\nindex minus the iterative index.\nThe fact that one can simulate the acoustics of a room and why convolution holds is due\nto a property of linear systems called superposition. Superposition can be defined as follows:\nGiven one input and its response, and another input and its response, the response to both these\ninputs must be the same as the simple addition of the single, observed responses. Similarly, given\nan input and its response, the response to that scaled input must be the observed response scaled\nby that same factor. Thus, any discrete signal can be modeled as a superposition of unit pulses.\nThe framework that was chosen for this project is Java. Java is an object-oriented\nprogramming language that lends itself well to dealing with quantized, discrete entities. Aside\nfrom its robust object-orientation, Java was chosen for its minimalist, visual Sampled Sound\nframework. The framework operates as follows: Each \"entity\" that deals with sound implements\nthe interface Line. Each Line represents a flow of data, either out or into the computer. There are\nmixer objects that serve as encapsulators and proprietors of these Lines. These mixer objects can\nbe obtained from the AudioSystem object and are direct interfaces to the different mixers present\non a machine. Due to the high level of abstraction, the framework simplifies the task of choosing\na mixer; all that is required is to specify the characteristics of the Mixer or the Lines. All of these\nclasses are encapsulated by the AudioSystem object, which serves as a hub from which Lines and\n\nMixers may be accessed. All of the remaining classes are simply instantiations of the mentioned\nsuperclasses and are a bit more specialized: some Lines are dedicated to sound capturing and\nothers to sound playback.\nWhen one accesses a Line, if it is available, one \"opens\" the line and starts streaming data\nto or from the program. The Java Sound framework only supports Pulse-Code Modulation\nencoding schemes, which are schemes that encode the wave as a succession of samples, each of\nwhich contains an amplitude of the sound wave. The stream is composed of an array of bytes\nwhich is renewed in intervals as the sound object is processed.\nThe convolver is implemented as follows: The Convolver class handles user interaction.\nFilenames and parameters are passed through the terminal and are interpreted by the program.\nComputation\nis\nhandled\nby\nthe\nConvolverMixer,\nwhich\nencompasses\ntwo\ninput\nInputAudioStreams, one for the unit impulse reponse, and another for the raw audio input, and\none output stream. The ConvolverMixer handles multiple channels gracefully, but places one\nmajor restriction on the input streams: both input lines must share the same sampling frequency,\nbit depth, and number of channels. The program is built hierarchically, dividing major tasks into\nsimpler subtasks. The convolved samples are output to the specified File that was included in the\nObject declaration. The output data file has the same properties of the input streams.\nThe output of the system merely convolves the audio (at this time). The files that I have\nused so far are freely available on the Internet. The output sounds convincing but could be\ntweaked to take into account differences in maximum amplitudes, among other factors. A way in\nwhich the program could be improved substantially would be by enabling the recording of voice\nin order for that stream to be convolved. Another way in which this Sonic System could be\nimproved would be by creating a method through which a unit impulse could be generated and\n\nanother through which a room's impulse response could be captured. This project has a lot of\npotential for experimentation with convolution and reverberation. Eventually, I hope to be able to\niteratively convolute a sound input and to arrive at a sound similar to Lucier's.\nReferences:\n- \"Overview of the sampled package\".

For this report, the Mellotron's functionality and\nunique timbre will be broken down and analyzed in order to reproduce a digital emulation of the\nrare instrument in the form of a PureData patch.\nPreceded by tape sampling instruments and experiments in the 1950's1, the Mellotron was\nnot historically the first keyboard instrument to use analog tape samples. However, it certainly\nbecame one of the most well-known sampling instruments. The first Mellotron was developed in\nBirmingham, England shortly after 1962. Based heavily upon the technology developed by\nAmerican inventor Harry Chamberlin, Bill Fransen, Chamberlin's sales agent, brought a couple of\nmachines to Britain in order to improve the quality of the instrument and place it in mass\nproduction. Following this, the Mellotron was born.\nBoth musicians and non-musicians seemed to find the instrument fascinating, and the\npopularity of the Mellotron soared with its ability to replicate the sounds of virtually any instrument.\nThe original purpose was to place \"the orchestra\" in the home, allowing for anyone with basic\nkeyboard knowledge to perform complicated melodies and backgrounds by simply using two hands.\nYet, the technology became a prominent fixture of rock music of the late 1960s and 70s following\nthe Beatles' 1967 recording of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" on their Magical Mystery Tour LP. Groups\nincluding The Moody Blues, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, David Bowie, and many\nothers drove its usage throughout much of the Progressive Rock era.\n1 Le Caine, Hugh. \"Dripsody.\" Compositions Demonstrations 1946-1974. By Hugh Le Caine. 1999.\n\nThe most basic Mellotrons have a defined set of features that give the instrument its\ncharacteristic sound. Most are smaller than a standard piano and can fit inside of a small room.\nThere are 66 keys, and each is affixed to an individual tape head and respective cassette tape found\nwithin the body of the instrument.2 These cassettes are mounted on a removable rack known as the\ntape frame, and the interchangeable tape frames contain the \"voices\" that will be produced by the\ninstrument. Most commonly, the Mellotron came prepackaged with simple flute, violin, and cello\nvoices, but additional tape frames could be purchased or reconfigured to give a greater variety of\nmusic.\nTo play a sound, a key is depressed, engaging the key's tape head. When the continually\nspooling tape is caught by the head and fed into a small reservoir. The sound slowly starts up and is\nproduced for a maximum of eight seconds, or the length of the tape. As this is happening, an\nattached spring is stretched. When released, a spring pulls down on the tape, and resets it for further\nuse in the future.\nThe Mellotron spools the tape prior to the key being pressed (left). When the key is pressed, the tape head clamps down\non the tape, and its content is played (right). When the key is released, the spring pulls the tape back into place.3\n2 \"Instruments Exist Side By Side.\" Billboard 6 November 1971: 22, 40.\n3 Luna04. Mellotron1, 2. Wikipedia.

However, it is due to these phenomena that the Mellotron retains its strange timbre.\nAfter continuous play, tapes suffer from the effects of wow and flutter. Wow is result of a change in\nthe angular velocity about a curve for which the tapes revolves around. Flutter is the effect that\noccurs when an external vibration due to some force (in this case, friction) cause for a change in the\noverall sound. Many then describe the resulting sound, given by the crudeness of the mechanisms\nthat govern the Mellotron, as similar to an old radio or record player.\nIn order to emulate this instrument, it is important to take into account not only the direct\nsound that the original produces but also the older mechanisms that were outlined above. To do\nthis, the following factors were considered:\n- The need to have a loadable array of \"tapes\" to create tape frames\n- An ADSR envelope that would mimic the effect of pressing a key\n- The usage of white/pink noise to recreate the effects of tape head reading\n- A changing LFO to simulate wow and flutter effects\n- The ability to adjust reverb settings\n- The randomness of tape jams and failures\nThough the implementation that was created is not perfect, many of these characteristics\nwere accounted for and produce favorable results. With this said, many improvements can be made\nincluding the following:\n- Looking further into using a MIDI controller (keyboard, joystick, etc.)\n- Improving instrument transitioning (smoothness)\n- Incorporating real-time pitch bending during play\n\nWorks Cited\n\"Instruments Exist Side By Side.\" Billboard 6 November 1971: 22, 40.\nLe Caine, Hugh. \"Dripsody.\" Compositions Demonstrations 1946-1974.

      "content": "The Menace of Mechanical Music\nJohn Philip Sousa\nOriginally published in Appleton's Magazine, Vol. 8 (1906), pp. 278-284.\nSWEEPING across the country with the speed of a transient fashion in slang or Panama hats,\npolitical war cries or popular novels, comes now the mechanical device to sing for us a song or\nplay for us a piano, in substitute for human skill, intelligence, and soul. Only by harking back to\nthe day of the roller skate or the bicycle craze, when sports of admitted utility ran to extravagance\nand virtual madness, can we find a parallel to the way in which these ingenious instruments have\ninvaded every community in the land. And if we turn from this comparison in pure mechanics to\nanother which may fairly claim a similar proportion of music in its soul, we may observe the\nEnglish sparrow, which, introduced and welcomed in all innocence, lost no time in multiplying\nitself to the dignity of a pest, to the destruction of numberless native song birds, and the\ninvariable regret of those who did not stop to think in time.\nOn a matter upon which I feel so deeply, and which I consider so far-reaching, I am quite willing\nto be reckoned an alarmist, admittedly swayed in part by personal interest, as well as by the\nimpending harm to American musical art. I foresee a marked deterioration in American music\nand musical taste, an interruption in the musical development of the country, and a host of other\ninjuries to music in its artistic manifestations, by virtue -- or rather by vice -- of the multiplication\nof the various music-reproducing machines. When I add to this that I myself and every other\npopular composer are victims of a serious infringement on our clear moral rights in our own work,\nI but offer a second reason why the facts and conditions should be made clear to everyone, alike\nin the interest of musical art and of fair play.\nIt cannot be denied that the owners and inventors have shown wonderful aggressiveness and\ningenuity in developing and exploiting these remarkable devices. Their mechanism has been\nsteadily and marvelously improved, and they have come into very extensive use. And it must be\nadmitted that where families lack time or inclination to acquire musical technic, and to hear\npublic performances, the best of these machines supply a certain amount of satisfaction and\npleasure. [279]\nBut heretofore, the whole course of music, from its first day to this, has been along the line of\nmaking it the expression of soul states; in other words, of pouring into it soul. Wagner,\nrepresenting the climax of this movement, declared again and again, \"I will not write even one\nmeasure of music that is not thoroughly sincere.\"\n\n\"What might be called a fair reproduction of Jove's\"'There is a man in there playing the piano with his\nprerogative.\"\nhands!'\"\nFrom the days when the mathematical and mechanical were paramount in music, the struggle has\nbeen bitter and incessant for the sway of the emotional and the soulful. And now, in this the\ntwentieth century, come these talking and playing machines, and offer again to reduce the\nexpression of music to a mathematical system of megaphones, wheels, cogs, disks, cylinders, and\nall manner of revolving things, which are as like real art as the marble statue of Eve is like her\nbeautiful, living, breathing daughters.\nAway back in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries rebellion had its start against musical\nautomatics, Palestrina proving in his compositions, that music is life, not mathematics; and Luther\nshowing, in his sublime hymns for congregational use and in his adaptations of secular melody\nfor the church, that music could be made the pouring out of the souls of the many in one grand,\neternal song. From the days of these pioneers, all great workers in the musical vineyard have\ngiven their best powers to the development of fruit, ever finer and more luscious, and in the doing\nhave brought their art near and nearer to the emotional life of man.\nThe nightingale's song is delightful because the nightingale herself gives it forth. The boy with a\npenny whistle and glass of water may give an excellent imitation, but let him persist, he is sent to\nbed as a nuisance. Thunder inspires awe in its connection with nature, but two lusty bass\ndrummers can drive you mad by what might be called a fair reproduction of Jove's prerogative. I\ndoubt if a dramatist could be inspired to write a tragedy by witnessing the mournful development\nand denouement of \"Punch and Judy\"; or an actress improve her delineation of heroic character\nby hearing the sobs of a Parisian doll. Was Garner led to study language and manners of the\norang-outang and his kin by watching the antics of a monkey-on-a-stick?\n\nIt is the living, breathing example alone that is valuable to the student and can set into motion his\ncreative and performing abilities. The ingenuity of a phonograph's mechanism may incite the\ninventive genius to its improvement, but I could not imagine that a performance by it would ever\ninspire embryotic Mendelssohns, Beethovens, Mozarts, and Wagners to the acquirement of\ntechnical skill, or to the grasp of human possibilities in the art.\n\"Incongruous as canned salmon by a trout\n\"Will the infant be put to sleep by machinery?\"\nbrook.\"\nElson, in his \"History of American Music,\" says: \"The true beginnings of American [280] music\n- seeds that finally grew into a harvest of native composition -- must be sought in a field almost as\nuncompromising as that of the Indian music itself - the rigid, narrow, and often commonplace\npsalm-singing of New England.\"\nStep by step through the centuries, working in an atmosphere almost wholly monopolized by\ncommercial pursuit, America has advanced art to such a degree that to-day she is the Mecca\ntoward which journey the artists of all nations. Musical enterprises are given financial support\nhere as nowhere else in the universe, while our appreciation of music is bounded only by our\ngeographical limits.\nThis wide love for the art springs from the singing school, secular or sacred; from the village\nband, and from the study of those instruments that are nearest the people. There are more pianos,\nviolins, guitars, mandolins, and banjos among the working classes of America than in all the rest\nof the world, and the presence of these instruments in the homes has given employment to\nenormous numbers of teachers who have patiently taught the children and inculcated a love for\nmusic throughout the various communities.\n\nRight here is the menace in machine-made music! The first rift in the lute has appeared. The\ncheaper of these instruments of the home are no longer being purchased as formerly, and all\nbecause the automatic music devices are usurping their places.\nAnd what is the result? The child becomes indifferent to practice, for when music can be heard in\nthe homes without the labor of study and close application, and without the slow process of\nacquiring a technic, it will be simply a question of time when the amateur disappears entirely, and\nwith him a host of vocal and instrumental teachers, who will be without field or calling.\nGreat Britain is experiencing this decline in domestic music and the English press is discussing it\nseriously in its editorials. A recent writer in the London Spectator dwells at considerable length\nupon the prevailing condition, and points to the novel as a sign of the times. The present-day\nfashionable writer of society fiction, he declares, does not find it necessary to reenforce his\nheroine with vocal accomplishment, \"as in the good old days.\" He ascribes the passing of home\nperformance, both vocal and instrumental, to the newborn love of athletics among the maids of\nAlbion, together with the introduction of the phonograph as a mechanical substitute for amateur\nperformances.\nHe believes that the exclamation of the little boy who rushed into his mother's room with the\nappeal: \"O mamma, come into the drawing-room; there is a man in there playing the piano with\nhis hands,\" is far less extravagant than many similar excursions into the domain of humorous and\nhuman [281] prophecy. He states from observation, that music has been steadily declining in\nGreat Britain as a factor in domestic life, and that the introduction of machine-made music into\nthe household is largely helping to assist in the change.\nWhile a craze for athletics may have something to do with the indifference of the amateur\nperformer in Great Britain, I do not believe it is much of a factor in this country. It is quite true\nthat American girls have followed the athletic trend of the nation for a long while; at the same\ntime they have made much headway in music, thanks to studious application. But let the\nmechanical music-maker be generally introduced into the homes; hour for hour these same girls\nwill listen to the machine's performance and, sure as can be, lose finally all interest in technical\nstudy.\nUnder such conditions the tide of amateurism cannot but recede, until there will be left only the\nmechanical device and the professional executant. Singing will no longer be a fine\naccomplishment; vocal exercises, so important a factor in the curriculum of physical culture, will\nbe out of vogue!\nThen what of the national throat? Will it not weaken? What of the national chest? Will it not\nshrink?\nWhen a mother can turn on the phonograph with the same ease that she applies to the electric\nlight, will she croon her baby to slumber with sweet lullabys, or will the infant be put to sleep by\nmachinery?\nChildren are naturally imitative, and if, in their infancy, they hear only phonographs, will they not\nsing, if they sing at all, in imitation and finally become simply human phonographs -- without\nsoul or expression? Congregational singing will suffer also, which, though crude at times, at least\nimproves the respiration of many a weary sinner and softens the voices of those who live amid\ntumult and noise.\n\nThe host of mechanical reproducing machines, in their mad desire to supply music for all\noccasions, are offering to supplant the illustrator in the class room, the dance orchestra, the home\nand public singers and players, and so on. Evidently they believe no field too large for their\nincursions, no claim too extravagant. But the further they can justify those claims, the more\nnoxious the whole system becomes.\nJust so far as a spirit of emulation once inspired proud parent or aspiring daughter to send for the\nmusic teacher when the neighbor child across the way began to take lessons, the emulation is\nturning to the purchase of a rival piano player in each house, and the hope of developing the local\nmusical personality is eliminated.\nThe country dance orchestra of violin, guitar and melodeon had to rest at times, and the resultant\ninterruption afforded the opportunity for general sociability and rest among the entire\ncompany. Now a tireless mechanism can keep everlastingly at it, and much of what made the\ndance a wholesome recreation is eliminated.\nThe country band with its energetic renditions, its loyal support by local merchants, its benefit\nconcerts, band wagon, gay uniforms, state tournaments, and the attendant pride and gayety, is\napparently doomed to vanish in the general assault on personality in music.\nThere was a time when the pine woods of the north were sacred to summer simplicity, when\naround the camp fire at night the stories were told and the songs were sung with a charm all their\nown. But even now the invasion of the north has begun, and the ingenious purveyor of canned\nmusic is urging the sportsman, on his way to the silent places with gun and rod, tent and canoe, to\ntake with him some disks, cranks, and cogs to sing to him as he sits by the firelight, a thought as\nunhappy and incongruous as canned salmon by a trout brook.\n\"With a gramophone caroling love songs from\namidships.\"\n\"Led to study language and manners\nof the orang-outang.\"\n\nIn the prospective scheme of mechanical music, we shall see man and maiden in a light canoe\nunder the summer moon upon an [282] Adirondack lake with a gramophone caroling love songs\nfrom amidships. The Spanish cavalier must abandon his guitar and serenade his beloved with a\nphonograph under his arm.\nShall we not expect that when the nation once more sounds its call to arms and the gallant\nregiment marches forth, there will be no majestic drum major, no serried ranks of sonorous\ntrombones, no glittering array of brass, no rolling of drums? In their stead will be a huge\nphonograph, mounted on a 100 H. P. automobile, grinding out \"The Girl I left Behind Me,\"\n\"Dixie,\" and \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\"\nHow the soldiers' bosoms will swell at the thought that they are being led into the strife by a\nmachine! And when in camp at night, they are gathered about the cheery fire, it will not be:\nGive us a song, the soldier cried.\nIt will not be:\nThey sang of love, and not of fame,\nForgot was Britain's\nglory;\nEach heart recalled a\ndifferent name,\nBut all sang \"Annie\nLaurie.\"\nBut it will be:\nWhir -- whir -- whir -- Song by the\nBungtown Quartet: \"Your Name is\nDennis.\"\nShades of Alexander, of Washington,\nof Napoleon, of Wellington, of\nGrant, and of the other immortal\nheroes! Never again will the soldier\nhear the defiant call of the bugle to\nbattle, and the historic lines must be\nchanged to:\n\"Gentlemen of the French guards,\nturn on your phonographs first.\"\nAnd the future d'Auteroches will\nreply:\n\"Sir, we never turn on our\nphonographs first; please to turn\n\"Led into the strife by a machine.\"\n\nyours first.\"\nIt is at the fireside that we look for virtue and patriotism; for songs that stir the blood and fire the\nzeal; for songs of home, of mother, and of love, that touch the heart and brighten the eye. Music\nteaches all that is beautiful in this world. Let us not hamper it with a machine that tells the story\nday by day, without variation, without soul, barren of the joy, the passion, the ardor that is the\ninheritance of man alone.\nAnd now a word on a detail of personal interest which has a right to be heard because it voices a\nclaim for fair play, far-reaching in its effects beyond the personal profit of one or many\nindividuals. I venture to say that it will come as an entire surprise to almost every reader to learn\nthat the composers of the music now produced so widely by the mechanical players of every sort\ndraw no profit from it whatever. Composers are entirely unprotected by the copyright laws of the\nUnited States as at present written on the statute books and interpreted by the courts. The\ncomposer of the most popular waltz or march of the year must see it seized, reproduced at will on\nwax cylinder, brass disk, or strip of perforated paper, multiplied indefinitely, and sold at large\nprofit all over the country, without a penny of remuneration to himself for the use of this original\nproduct of his brain.\nIt is this fact that is the immediate occasion of the present article, for the whole subject has\nbecome acute by reason of certain proposed legislation in Congress at Washington. The two\nphases of the subject -- fair play to music and fair play to musicians -- are so naturally connected\nthat I have not hesitated to cover the legal and the artistic sides of the question in a single\ndiscussion.\nA new copyright bill was introduced in Congress at the last session, a joint committee met on\nJune 6th, to hear arguments on the bill as presented, and the following paragraph was cause for\nlively discussion on the part of the various talking-machine interests and composers represented:\nParagraph (G) of Section I, which provides \"that the copyright secured by this Act shall include\nthe sole and exclusive right to make, sell, distribute, or let for hire any device, contrivance, or\nappliance especially [283] adapted in any manner whatsoever to reproduce to the ear the whole or\nany material part of any work published and copyrighted after this Act shall have gone into effect,\nor by means of any such device or appliance publicly to reproduce to the ear the whole or any\nmaterial part of such work.\"\nI was among those present, and became particularly keen on the efforts of opposing interests to\nimpress upon the committee by specious argument and fallacious interpretation that the composer\nof music had no rights under the Constitution that they were bound to respect; and that remedial\nlegislation was wholly out of the question until the Constitution had first been amended.\nOne gentleman went the length of declaring that he would never have worked out his reproducing\napparatus, had he not felt confident that the Constitution gave him the right to appropriate the\nbrightest efforts of the American composer, and he voiced the belief that any act giving the\ncomposer ownership in his own property would be most unconstitutional.\nAsked if he claimed the right to take one of my compositions and use it in connection with his\nmechanical device without compensation to myself, his unselfish reply was: \"Under the\nConstitution and all the laws of the land, I say Yes, decidedly!\"\n\nAsked if he was not protected in his patents, his answer was promptly in the affirmative, but he\nseemed wholly unable to grasp the proposition that a composer should ask for similar protection\non his creative work.\nAsked finally if he desired the Constitution amended, he replied magnanimously: \"No, sir, I want\nthe Constitution to stand as it is.\"\nOf course it must not be overlooked that in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals a case has\njust been decided adversely to the composer's rights in the profits accruing from the use of his\ncompositions on the talking and playing machines, but this case awaits final adjudication, on\nappeal, in the United States Supreme Court. Judges Lacombe, Coxe, and Townsend rendered a\ndecision as follows:\n\"We are of the opinion that a perforated paper roll, such as is manufactured by defendant, is not a\ncopy of complainant's staff notation, for the following reasons:\n\"It is not a copy in fact; it is not designed to be read or actually used in reading music as the\noriginal staff notation is; and the claim that it may be read, which is practically disproved by the\ngreat preponderance of evidence, even if true, would establish merely a theory or possibility of\nuse, as distinguished from an actual use. The argument that because the roll is a notation or\nrecord of the music, it is, therefore, a copy, would apply to the disk of the phonograph or the\nbarrel of the organ, which, it must be admitted, are not copies of the sheet music. The\nperforations in the rolls are not a varied form of symbols substituted for the symbols used by the\nauthor. They are mere adjuncts of a valve mechanism in a machine. In fact, the machine, or\nmusical playing device, is the thing which appropriates the author's property and publishes it by\nproducing the musical sounds, thus conveying the author's composition to the public.\"\nMay I ask, does this machine appropriate the author's composition without human assistance? Is\nthe machine a free agent? Does it go about to seek whom it may devour? And if, as quoted\nabove, the machine \"publishes it,\" is not the owner of the machine responsible for its acts?\n\n\"The Spanish cavalier must abandon his\nguitar.\"\n\"Does it go about to seek whom it may devour?\"\nIs a copyright simply represented by a sheet of music? Is there no more to it than the silent\nnotation? The little black spots on the five lines and spaces, the measured bars, are merely the\nrecord of birth and existence of a musical thought. These marks are something beyond the mere\nshape, the color, the length of the pages. They are only one form [284] of recording the coming\ninto the world of a newly fashioned work, which, by the right of authorship, inherent and\nconstitutional, belongs to him who conceived it. They are no more the living theme which they\nrecord than the description of a beautiful woman is the woman herself.\nShould the day come that the courts will give me the absolute power of controlling my\ncompositions, which I feel is now mine under the Constitution, then I am not so sure that my\nname will appear as often as at present in the catalogues of the talking and playing machines.\nEvidently Judge Abinger, of the English bar, believes in the doctrine of substance, for he says:\n\"The most unlettered in music can distinguish one song from another; and the mere adaptation of\nthe air, either by changing it to a dance, or by transferring it from one instrument to another, does\nnot, even to common apprehension, alter the original subject. The ear tells you that it is the\nsame. The original air requires the aid of a genius for its construction; but a mere mechanic in\nmusic can make the adaptation or accompaniment. Substantially the piracy is where the\nappropriated music, though adapted to a different purpose from that of the original, may still be\nrecognized by the ear.\"\nAgain the English court says:\n\"The composition of a new air or melody is entitled to protection; and the appropriation of the\nwhole, or of any substantial part of it, without the license of the author, is a piracy, and the\nadaptation of it, either by changing it to a dance, or by transferring it from one instrument to\n\nanother, if the ear detects the same air, in the same arrangement, will not relieve it from the\npenalty.\"\nThe section of the Constitution on which my whole legal contention is based provides:\n\"The Congress shall have power to secure for limited time to authors and inventors the exclusive\nright to their respective writings and discoveries.\"\nAnd my claim is, that the words \"exclusive\" and \"writings,\" particularly the latter, are so broad in\ntheir meaning that they cover every point raised by existing copyright laws, even to the\nunauthorized use of musical compositions by mechanical-reproducing apparatuses, and all this\nbecause these two words deal, not alone with the letter, but with the spirit as well.\nBut let the ambiguities in the text of law be what they may; let there be of legal quips and quirks\nas many as you please, for the life of me I am puzzled to know why the powerful corporations\ncontrolling these playing and talking machines are so totally blind to the moral and ethical\nquestions involved. Could anything be more blamable, as a matter of principle, than to take an\nartist's composition, reproduce it a thousandfold on their machines, and deny him all participation\nin the large financial returns, by hiding back of the diaphanous pretense that in the guise of a disk\nor roll, his composition is not his property?\nDo they not realize that if the accredited composers, who have come into vogue by reason of\nmerit and labor, are refused a just reward for their efforts, a condition is almost sure to arise\nwhere all incentive to further creative work is lacking, and compositions will no longer flow from\ntheir pens; or where they will be compelled to refrain from publishing their compositions at all,\nand control them in manuscript? What, then, of the playing and talking machines?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n21M.380 Music and Technology (Contemporary History and Aesthetics)\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

No doubt there was more than one such father, but at least\none did something about it. Eric Eldred, a retired computer program\nmer living in New Hampshire, decided to put Hawthorne on the\nWeb. An electronic version, Eldred thought, with links to pictures and\nexplanatory text, would make this nineteenth-century author's work\ncome alive.\nIt didn't work--at least for his daughters. They didn't find Haw\nthorne any more interesting than before. But Eldred's experiment gave\nbirth to a hobby, and his hobby begat a cause: Eldred would build a\nlibrary of public domain works by scanning these works and making\nthem available for free.\nEldred's library was not simply a copy of certain public domain\nworks, though even a copy would have been of great value to people\nacross the world who can't get access to printed versions of these\nworks. Instead, Eldred was producing derivative works from these\npublic domain works. Just as Disney turned Grimm into stories more\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\naccessible to the twentieth century, Eldred transformed Hawthorne,\nand many others, into a form more accessible--technically accessi\nble--today.\nEldred's freedom to do this with Hawthorne's work grew from the\nsame source as Disney's. Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter had passed into the\npublic domain in 1907. It was free for anyone to take without the per\nmission of the Hawthorne estate or anyone else. Some, such as Dover\nPress and Penguin Classics, take works from the public domain and\nproduce printed editions, which they sell in bookstores across the\ncountry. Others, such as Disney, take these stories and turn them into\nanimated cartoons, sometimes successfully (Cinderella), sometimes not\n(The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet). These are all commer\ncial publications of public domain works.\nThe Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications\nof public domain works. Eldred's is just one example. There are liter\nally thousands of others. Hundreds of thousands from across the world\nhave discovered this platform of expression and now use it to share\nworks that are, by law, free for the taking. This has produced what we\nmight call the \"noncommercial publishing industry,\" which before the\nInternet was limited to people with large egos or with political or so\ncial causes. But with the Internet, it includes a wide range of individu\nals and groups dedicated to spreading culture generally.1\nAs I said, Eldred lives in New Hampshire. In 1998, Robert Frost's\ncollection of poems New Hampshire was slated to pass into the public\ndomain. Eldred wanted to post that collection in his free public library.\nBut Congress got in the way. As I described in chapter 10, in 1998, for\nthe eleventh time in forty years, Congress extended the terms of exist\ning copyrights--this time by twenty years. Eldred would not be free to\nadd any works more recent than 1923 to his collection until 2019. In\ndeed, no copyrighted work would pass into the public domain until\nthat year (and not even then, if Congress extends the term again). By\ncontrast, in the same period, more than 1 million patents will pass into\nthe public domain.\n214 FREE CULTURE\n\nThis was the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act\n(CTEA), enacted in memory of the congressman and former musician\nSonny Bono, who, his widow, Mary Bono, says, believed that \"copy\nrights should be forever.\"2\nEldred decided to fight this law. He first resolved to fight it through\ncivil disobedience. In a series of interviews, Eldred announced that he\nwould publish as planned, CTEA notwithstanding. But because of a\nsecond law passed in 1998, the NET (No Electronic Theft) Act, his act\nof publishing would make Eldred a felon--whether or not anyone\ncomplained. This was a dangerous strategy for a disabled programmer\nto undertake.\nIt was here that I became involved in Eldred's battle. I was a con\nstitutional scholar whose first passion was constitutional interpreta\ntion. And though constitutional law courses never focus upon the\nProgress Clause of the Constitution, it had always struck me as impor\ntantly different. As you know, the Constitution says,\nCongress has the power to promote the Progress of Science . . .\nby securing for limited Times to Authors . . . exclusive Right to\ntheir . . . Writings. . . .\nAs I've described, this clause is unique within the power-granting\nclause of Article I, section 8 of our Constitution. Every other clause\ngranting power to Congress simply says Congress has the power to do\nsomething--for example, to regulate \"commerce among the several\nstates\" or \"declare War.\" But here, the \"something\" is something quite spe\ncific--to \"promote . . . Progress\"--through means that are also specific--\nby \"securing\" \"exclusive Rights\" (i.e., copyrights) \"for limited Times.\"\nIn the past forty years, Congress has gotten into the practice of ex\ntending existing terms of copyright protection. What puzzled me\nabout this was, if Congress has the power to extend existing terms,\nthen the Constitution's requirement that terms be \"limited\" will have\nno practical effect. If every time a copyright is about to expire, Con-\nBALANCES 215\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\ngress has the power to extend its term, then Congress can achieve what\nthe Constitution plainly forbids--perpetual terms \"on the installment\nplan,\" as Professor Peter Jaszi so nicely put it.\nAs an academic, my first response was to hit the books. I remember\nsitting late at the office, scouring on-line databases for any serious con\nsideration of the question. No one had ever challenged Congress's\npractice of extending existing terms. That failure may in part be why\nCongress seemed so untroubled in its habit. That, and the fact that the\npractice had become so lucrative for Congress. Congress knows that\ncopyright owners will be willing to pay a great deal of money to see\ntheir copyright terms extended. And so Congress is quite happy to\nkeep this gravy train going.\nFor this is the core of the corruption in our present system of\ngovernment.\"Corruption\"not in the sense that representatives are bribed.\nRather, \"corruption\" in the sense that the system induces the benefici\naries of Congress's acts to raise and give money to Congress to induce\nit to act. There's only so much time; there's only so much Congress can\ndo. Why not limit its actions to those things it must do--and those\nthings that pay? Extending copyright terms pays.\nIf that's not obvious to you, consider the following: Say you're one\nof the very few lucky copyright owners whose copyright continues to\nmake money one hundred years after it was created. The Estate of\nRobert Frost is a good example. Frost died in 1963. His poetry contin\nues to be extraordinarily valuable. Thus the Robert Frost estate bene\nfits greatly from any extension of copyright, since no publisher would\npay the estate any money if the poems Frost wrote could be published\nby anyone for free.\nSo imagine the Robert Frost estate is earning $100,000 a year from\nthree of Frost's poems. And imagine the copyright for those poems\nis about to expire. You sit on the board of the Robert Frost estate.\nYour financial adviser comes to your board meeting with a very grim\nreport:\n\"Next year,\" the adviser announces, \"our copyrights in works A, B,\n216 FREE CULTURE\n\nand C will expire. That means that after next year, we will no longer be\nreceiving the annual royalty check of $100,000 from the publishers of\nthose works.\n\"There's a proposal in Congress, however,\" she continues, \"that\ncould change this. A few congressmen are floating a bill to extend the\nterms of copyright by twenty years. That bill would be extraordinarily\nvaluable to us. So we should hope this bill passes.\"\n\"Hope?\" a fellow board member says. \"Can't we be doing something\nabout it?\"\n\"Well, obviously, yes,\" the adviser responds. \"We could contribute\nto the campaigns of a number of representatives to try to assure that\nthey support the bill.\"\nYou hate politics. You hate contributing to campaigns. So you want\nto know whether this disgusting practice is worth it. \"How much\nwould we get if this extension were passed?\" you ask the adviser. \"How\nmuch is it worth?\"\n\"Well,\" the adviser says, \"if you're confident that you will continue\nto get at least $100,000 a year from these copyrights, and you use the\n'discount rate' that we use to evaluate estate investments (6 percent),\nthen this law would be worth $1,146,000 to the estate.\"\nYou're a bit shocked by the number, but you quickly come to the\ncorrect conclusion:\n\"So you're saying it would be worth it for us to pay more than\n$1,000,000 in campaign contributions if we were confident those con\ntributions would assure that the bill was passed?\"\n\"Absolutely,\" the adviser responds. \"It is worth it to you to con\ntribute up to the 'present value' of the income you expect from these\ncopyrights. Which for us means over $1,000,000.\"\nYou quickly get the point--you as the member of the board and, I\ntrust, you the reader. Each time copyrights are about to expire, every\nbeneficiary in the position of the Robert Frost estate faces the same\nchoice: If they can contribute to get a law passed to extend copyrights,\nthey will benefit greatly from that extension. And so each time copy-\nBALANCES 217\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nrights are about to expire, there is a massive amount of lobbying to get\nthe copyright term extended.\nThus a congressional perpetual motion machine: So long as legisla\ntion can be bought (albeit indirectly), there will be all the incentive in\nthe world to buy further extensions of copyright.\nIn the lobbying that led to the passage of the Sonny Bono Copy\nright Term Extension Act, this \"theory\" about incentives was proved\nreal. Ten of the thirteen original sponsors of the act in the House\nreceived the maximum contribution from Disney's political action\ncommittee; in the Senate, eight of the twelve sponsors received contri\nbutions.3 The RIAA and the MPAA are estimated to have spent over\n$1.5 million lobbying in the 1998 election cycle. They paid out more\nthan $200,000 in campaign contributions.4 Disney is estimated to have\ncontributed more than $800,000 to reelection campaigns in the 1998\ncycle.5\nConstitutional law is not oblivious to the obvious. Or at least,\nit need not be. So when I was considering Eldred's complaint, this re\nality about the never-ending incentives to increase the copyright term\nwas central to my thinking. In my view, a pragmatic court committed\nto interpreting and applying the Constitution of our framers would see\nthat if Congress has the power to extend existing terms, then there\nwould be no effective constitutional requirement that terms be \"lim\nited.\" If they could extend it once, they would extend it again and again\nand again.\nIt was also my judgment that this Supreme Court would not allow\nCongress to extend existing terms. As anyone close to the Supreme\nCourt's work knows, this Court has increasingly restricted the power\nof Congress when it has viewed Congress's actions as exceeding the\npower granted to it by the Constitution. Among constitutional schol\nars, the most famous example of this trend was the Supreme Court's\n218 FREE CULTURE\n\ndecision in 1995 to strike down a law that banned the possession of\nguns near schools.\nSince 1937, the Supreme Court had interpreted Congress's granted\npowers very broadly; so, while the Constitution grants Congress the\npower to regulate only \"commerce among the several states\" (aka \"in\nterstate commerce\"), the Supreme Court had interpreted that power to\ninclude the power to regulate any activity that merely affected inter\nstate commerce.\nAs the economy grew, this standard increasingly meant that there\nwas no limit to Congress's power to regulate, since just about every ac\ntivity, when considered on a national scale, affects interstate commerce.\nA Constitution designed to limit Congress's power was instead inter\npreted to impose no limit.\nThe Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Rehnquist's command,\nchanged that in United States v. Lopez. The government had argued\nthat possessing guns near schools affected interstate commerce. Guns\nnear schools increase crime, crime lowers property values, and so on. In\nthe oral argument, the Chief Justice asked the government whether\nthere was any activity that would not affect interstate commerce under\nthe reasoning the government advanced. The government said there\nwas not; if Congress says an activity affects interstate commerce, then\nthat activity affects interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, the gov\nernment said, was not in the position to second-guess Congress.\n\"We pause to consider the implications of the government's argu\nments,\" the Chief Justice wrote.6 If anything Congress says is interstate\ncommerce must therefore be considered interstate commerce, then\nthere would be no limit to Congress's power. The decision in Lopez was\nreaffirmed five years later in United States v. Morrison.7\nIf a principle were at work here, then it should apply to the Progress\nClause as much as the Commerce Clause.8 And if it is applied to the\nProgress Clause, the principle should yield the conclusion that Con\ngress can't extend an existing term. If Congress could extend an exist-\nBALANCES 219\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\ning term, then there would be no \"stopping point\" to Congress's power\nover terms, though the Constitution expressly states that there is such\na limit. Thus, the same principle applied to the power to grant copy\nrights should entail that Congress is not allowed to extend the term of\nexisting copyrights.\nIf, that is, the principle announced in Lopez stood for a principle.\nMany believed the decision in Lopez stood for politics--a conservative\nSupreme Court, which believed in states' rights, using its power over\nCongress to advance its own personal political preferences. But I re\njected that view of the Supreme Court's decision. Indeed, shortly after\nthe decision, I wrote an article demonstrating the \"fidelity\" in such an\ninterpretation of the Constitution. The idea that the Supreme Court\ndecides cases based upon its politics struck me as extraordinarily bor\ning. I was not going to devote my life to teaching constitutional law if\nthese nine Justices were going to be petty politicians.\nNow let's pause for a moment to make sure we understand what\nthe argument in Eldred was not about. By insisting on the Constitu\ntion's limits to copyright, obviously Eldred was not endorsing piracy.\nIndeed, in an obvious sense, he was fighting a kind of piracy--piracy of\nthe public domain. When Robert Frost wrote his work and when Walt\nDisney created Mickey Mouse, the maximum copyright term was just\nfifty-six years. Because of interim changes, Frost and Disney had al\nready enjoyed a seventy-five-year monopoly for their work. They had\ngotten the benefit of the bargain that the Constitution envisions: In\nexchange for a monopoly protected for fifty-six years, they created new\nwork. But now these entities were using their power--expressed\nthrough the power of lobbyists' money--to get another twenty-year\ndollop of monopoly. That twenty-year dollop would be taken from the\npublic domain. Eric Eldred was fighting a piracy that affects us all.\nSome people view the public domain with contempt. In their brief\n220 FREE CULTURE\n\nbefore the Supreme Court, the Nashville Songwriters Association\nwrote that the public domain is nothing more than \"legal piracy.\"9 But\nit is not piracy when the law allows it; and in our constitutional system,\nour law requires it. Some may not like the Constitution's requirements,\nbut that doesn't make the Constitution a pirate's charter.\nAs we've seen, our constitutional system requires limits on copy\nright as a way to assure that copyright holders do not too heavily influ\nence the development and distribution of our culture. Yet, as Eric\nEldred discovered, we have set up a system that assures that copyright\nterms will be repeatedly extended, and extended, and extended. We\nhave created the perfect storm for the public domain. Copyrights have\nnot expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to be\nbought to extend them again.\nIt is valuable copyrights that are responsible for terms being ex\ntended. Mickey Mouse and \"Rhapsody in Blue.\" These works are too\nvaluable for copyright owners to ignore. But the real harm to our soci\nety from copyright extensions is not that Mickey Mouse remains Dis\nney's. Forget Mickey Mouse. Forget Robert Frost. Forget all the works\nfrom the 1920s and 1930s that have continuing commercial value. The\nreal harm of term extension comes not from these famous works. The\nreal harm is to the works that are not famous, not commercially ex\nploited, and no longer available as a result.\nIf you look at the work created in the first twenty years (1923 to\n1942) affected by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,\n2 percent of that work has any continuing commercial value. It was the\ncopyright holders for that 2 percent who pushed the CTEA through.\nBut the law and its effect were not limited to that 2 percent. The law\nextended the terms of copyright generally.10\nThink practically about the consequence of this extension--practi\ncally, as a businessperson, and not as a lawyer eager for more legal\nBALANCES 221\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nwork. In 1930, 10,047 books were published. In 2000, 174 of those\nbooks were still in print. Let's say you were Brewster Kahle, and you\nwanted to make available to the world in your iArchive project the re\nmaining 9,873. What would you have to do?\nWell, first, you'd have to determine which of the 9,873 books were\nstill under copyright. That requires going to a library (these data are\nnot on-line) and paging through tomes of books, cross-checking the\ntitles and authors of the 9,873 books with the copyright registration\nand renewal records for works published in 1930. That will produce a\nlist of books still under copyright.\nThen for the books still under copyright, you would need to locate\nthe current copyright owners. How would you do that?\nMost people think that there must be a list of these copyright own\ners somewhere. Practical people think this way. How could there be\nthousands and thousands of government monopolies without there\nbeing at least a list?\nBut there is no list. There may be a name from 1930, and then in\n1959, of the person who registered the copyright. But just think prac\ntically about how impossibly difficult it would be to track down thou\nsands of such records--especially since the person who registered is\nnot necessarily the current owner. And we're just talking about 1930!\n\"But there isn't a list of who owns property generally,\" the apolo\ngists for the system respond. \"Why should there be a list of copyright\nowners?\"\nWell, actually, if you think about it, there are plenty of lists of who\nowns what property. Think about deeds on houses, or titles to cars.\nAnd where there isn't a list, the code of real space is pretty good at sug\ngesting who the owner of a bit of property is. (A swing set in your\nbackyard is probably yours.) So formally or informally, we have a pretty\ngood way to know who owns what tangible property.\nSo: You walk down a street and see a house. You can know who\nowns the house by looking it up in the courthouse registry. If you see\na car, there is ordinarily a license plate that will link the owner to the\n222 FREE CULTURE\n\ncar. If you see a bunch of children's toys sitting on the front lawn of a\nhouse, it's fairly easy to determine who owns the toys. And if you hap\npen to see a baseball lying in a gutter on the side of the road, look\naround for a second for some kids playing ball. If you don't see any\nkids, then okay: Here's a bit of property whose owner we can't easily\ndetermine. It is the exception that proves the rule: that we ordinarily\nknow quite well who owns what property.\nCompare this story to intangible property. You go into a library.\nThe library owns the books. But who owns the copyrights? As I've al\nready described, there's no list of copyright owners. There are authors'\nnames, of course, but their copyrights could have been assigned, or\npassed down in an estate like Grandma's old jewelry. To know who\nowns what, you would have to hire a private detective. The bottom\nline: The owner cannot easily be located. And in a regime like ours, in\nwhich it is a felony to use such property without the property owner's\npermission, the property isn't going to be used.\nThe consequence with respect to old books is that they won't be\ndigitized, and hence will simply rot away on shelves. But the conse\nquence for other creative works is much more dire.\nConsider the story of Michael Agee, chairman of Hal Roach Stu\ndios, which owns the copyrights for the Laurel and Hardy films. Agee\nis a direct beneficiary of the Bono Act. The Laurel and Hardy films\nwere made between 1921 and 1951. Only one of these films, The Lucky\nDog, is currently out of copyright. But for the CTEA, films made after\n1923 would have begun entering the public domain. Because Agee\ncontrols the exclusive rights for these popular films, he makes a great\ndeal of money. According to one estimate, \"Roach has sold about\n60,000 videocassettes and 50,000 DVDs of the duo's silent films.\"11\nYet Agee opposed the CTEA. His reasons demonstrate a rare\nvirtue in this culture: selflessness. He argued in a brief before the\nSupreme Court that the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act\nwill, if left standing, destroy a whole generation of American film.\nHis argument is straightforward. A tiny fraction of this work has\nBALANCES 223\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nany continuing commercial value. The rest--to the extent it survives at\nall--sits in vaults gathering dust. It may be that some of this work not\nnow commercially valuable will be deemed to be valuable by the own\ners of the vaults. For this to occur, however, the commercial benefit\nfrom the work must exceed the costs of making the work available for\ndistribution.\nWe can't know the benefits, but we do know a lot about the costs.\nFor most of the history of film, the costs of restoring film were very\nhigh; digital technology has lowered these costs substantially. While\nit cost more than $10,000 to restore a ninety-minute black-and-white\nfilm in 1993, it can now cost as little as $100 to digitize one hour of 8\nmm film.12\nRestoration technology is not the only cost, nor the most impor\ntant. Lawyers, too, are a cost, and increasingly, a very important one. In\naddition to preserving the film, a distributor needs to secure the rights.\nAnd to secure the rights for a film that is under copyright, you need to\nlocate the copyright owner.\nOr more accurately, owners. As we've seen, there isn't only a single\ncopyright associated with a film; there are many. There isn't a single\nperson whom you can contact about those copyrights; there are as\nmany as can hold the rights, which turns out to be an extremely large\nnumber. Thus the costs of clearing the rights to these films is excep\ntionally high.\n\"But can't you just restore the film, distribute it, and then pay the\ncopyright owner when she shows up?\" Sure, if you want to commit a\nfelony. And even if you're not worried about committing a felony, when\nshe does show up, she'll have the right to sue you for all the profits you\nhave made. So, if you're successful, you can be fairly confident you'll be\ngetting a call from someone's lawyer. And if you're not successful, you\nwon't make enough to cover the costs of your own lawyer. Either way,\nyou have to talk to a lawyer. And as is too often the case, saying you have\nto talk to a lawyer is the same as saying you won't make any money.\nFor some films, the benefit of releasing the film may well exceed\n224 FREE CULTURE\n\nthese costs. But for the vast majority of them, there is no way the ben\nefit would outweigh the legal costs. Thus, for the vast majority of old\nfilms, Agee argued, the film will not be restored and distributed until\nthe copyright expires.\nBut by the time the copyright for these films expires, the film will\nhave expired. These films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and\nnitrate stock dissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal can\nisters in which they are now stored will be filled with nothing more\nthan dust.\nOf all the creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny\nfraction has continuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the\ncopyright is a crucially important legal device. For that tiny fraction,\nthe copyright creates incentives to produce and distribute the cre\native work. For that tiny fraction, the copyright acts as an \"engine of\nfree expression.\"\nBut even for that tiny fraction, the actual time during which the\ncreative work has a commercial life is extremely short. As I've indi\ncated, most books go out of print within one year. The same is true of\nmusic and film. Commercial culture is sharklike. It must keep moving.\nAnd when a creative work falls out of favor with the commercial dis\ntributors, the commercial life ends.\nYet that doesn't mean the life of the creative work ends. We don't\nkeep libraries of books in order to compete with Barnes & Noble, and\nwe don't have archives of films because we expect people to choose be\ntween spending Friday night watching new movies and spending Fri\nday night watching a 1930 news documentary. The noncommercial life\nof culture is important and valuable--for entertainment but also, and\nmore importantly, for knowledge. To understand who we are, and\nwhere we came from, and how we have made the mistakes that we\nhave, we need to have access to this history.\nCopyrights in this context do not drive an engine of free expression.\nBALANCES 225\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nIn this context, there is no need for an exclusive right. Copyrights in\nthis context do no good.\nYet, for most of our history, they also did little harm. For most of\nour history, when a work ended its commercial life, there was no\ncopyright-related use that would be inhibited by an exclusive right.\nWhen a book went out of print, you could not buy it from a publisher.\nBut you could still buy it from a used book store, and when a used book\nstore sells it, in America, at least, there is no need to pay the copyright\nowner anything. Thus, the ordinary use of a book after its commercial\nlife ended was a use that was independent of copyright law.\nThe same was effectively true of film. Because the costs of restoring\na film--the real economic costs, not the lawyer costs--were so high, it\nwas never at all feasible to preserve or restore film. Like the remains of\na great dinner, when it's over, it's over. Once a film passed out of its\ncommercial life, it may have been archived for a bit, but that was the\nend of its life so long as the market didn't have more to offer.\nIn other words, though copyright has been relatively short for most\nof our history, long copyrights wouldn't have mattered for the works\nthat lost their commercial value. Long copyrights for these works\nwould not have interfered with anything.\nBut this situation has now changed.\nOne crucially important consequence of the emergence of digital\ntechnologies is to enable the archive that Brewster Kahle dreams of.\nDigital technologies now make it possible to preserve and give access\nto all sorts of knowledge. Once a book goes out of print, we can now\nimagine digitizing it and making it available to everyone, forever. Once\na film goes out of distribution, we could digitize it and make it avail\nable to everyone, forever. Digital technologies give new life to copy\nrighted material after it passes out of its commercial life. It is now\npossible to preserve and assure universal access to this knowledge and\nculture, whereas before it was not.\nAnd now copyright law does get in the way. Every step of produc\n226 FREE CULTURE\n\ning this digital archive of our culture infringes on the exclusive right of\ncopyright. To digitize a book is to copy it. To do that requires permis\nsion of the copyright owner. The same with music, film, or any other\naspect of our culture protected by copyright. The effort to make these\nthings available to history, or to researchers, or to those who just want\nto explore, is now inhibited by a set of rules that were written for a rad\nically different context.\nHere is the core of the harm that comes from extending terms:\nNow that technology enables us to rebuild the library of Alexandria,\nthe law gets in the way. And it doesn't get in the way for any useful\ncopyright purpose, for the purpose of copyright is to enable the com\nmercial market that spreads culture. No, we are talking about culture\nafter it has lived its commercial life. In this context, copyright is serv\ning no purpose at all related to the spread of knowledge. In this con\ntext, copyright is not an engine of free expression. Copyright is a brake.\nYou may well ask, \"But if digital technologies lower the costs for\nBrewster Kahle, then they will lower the costs for Random House, too.\nSo won't Random House do as well as Brewster Kahle in spreading\nculture widely?\"\nMaybe. Someday. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest\nthat publishers would be as complete as libraries. If Barnes & Noble\noffered to lend books from its stores for a low price, would that elimi\nnate the need for libraries? Only if you think that the only role of a li\nbrary is to serve what \"the market\" would demand. But if you think the\nrole of a library is bigger than this--if you think its role is to archive\nculture, whether there's a demand for any particular bit of that culture\nor not--then we can't count on the commercial market to do our li\nbrary work for us.\nI would be the first to agree that it should do as much as it can: We\nshould rely upon the market as much as possible to spread and enable\nculture. My message is absolutely not antimarket. But where we see the\nmarket is not doing the job, then we should allow nonmarket forces the\nBALANCES 227\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nfreedom to fill the gaps. As one researcher calculated for American cul\nture, 94 percent of the films, books, and music produced between 1923\nand 1946 is not commercially available. However much you love the\ncommercial market, if access is a value, then 6 percent is a failure to\nprovide that value.13\nIn January 1999, we filed a lawsuit on Eric Eldred's behalf in fed\neral district court in Washington, D.C., asking the court to declare the\nSonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act unconstitutional. The two\ncentral claims that we made were (1) that extending existing terms vio\nlated the Constitution's \"limited Times\" requirement, and (2) that ex\ntending terms by another twenty years violated the First Amendment.\nThe district court dismissed our claims without even hearing an ar\ngument. A panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also dis\nmissed our claims, though after hearing an extensive argument. But\nthat decision at least had a dissent, by one of the most conservative\njudges on that court. That dissent gave our claims life.\nJudge David Sentelle said the CTEA violated the requirement that\ncopyrights be for \"limited Times\" only. His argument was as elegant as\nit was simple: If Congress can extend existing terms, then there is no\n\"stopping point\" to Congress's power under the Copyright Clause. The\npower to extend existing terms means Congress is not required to grant\nterms that are \"limited.\" Thus, Judge Sentelle argued, the court had to\ninterpret the term \"limited Times\" to give it meaning. And the best in\nterpretation, Judge Sentelle argued, would be to deny Congress the\npower to extend existing terms.\nWe asked the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as a whole to\nhear the case. Cases are ordinarily heard in panels of three, except for\nimportant cases or cases that raise issues specific to the circuit as a\nwhole, where the court will sit \"en banc\" to hear the case.\nThe Court of Appeals rejected our request to hear the case en banc.\nThis time, Judge Sentelle was joined by the most liberal member of the\n228 FREE CULTURE\n\nD.C. Circuit, Judge David Tatel. Both the most conservative and the\nmost liberal judges in the D.C. Circuit believed Congress had over\nstepped its bounds.\nIt was here that most expected Eldred v. Ashcroft would die, for the\nSupreme Court rarely reviews any decision by a court of appeals. (It\nhears about one hundred cases a year, out of more than five thousand\nappeals.) And it practically never reviews a decision that upholds a\nstatute when no other court has yet reviewed the statute.\nBut in February 2002, the Supreme Court surprised the world by\ngranting our petition to review the D.C. Circuit opinion. Argument\nwas set for October of 2002. The summer would be spent writing\nbriefs and preparing for argument.\nIt is over a year later as I write these words. It is still astonishingly\nhard. If you know anything at all about this story, you know that we\nlost the appeal. And if you know something more than just the mini\nmum, you probably think there was no way this case could have been\nwon. After our defeat, I received literally thousands of missives by\nwell-wishers and supporters, thanking me for my work on behalf of\nthis noble but doomed cause. And none from this pile was more sig\nnificant to me than the e-mail from my client, Eric Eldred.\nBut my client and these friends were wrong. This case could have\nbeen won. It should have been won. And no matter how hard I try to\nretell this story to myself, I can never escape believing that my own\nmistake lost it.\nThe mistake was made early, though it became obvious only at the\nvery end. Our case had been supported from the very beginning by an ex\ntraordinary lawyer, Geoffrey Stewart, and by the law firm he had moved\nto, Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue. Jones Day took a great deal of heat\nfrom its copyright-protectionist clients for supporting us. They ig-\nBALANCES 229\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nnored this pressure (something that few law firms today would ever\ndo), and throughout the case, they gave it everything they could.\nThere were three key lawyers on the case from Jones Day. Geoff\nStewart was the first, but then Dan Bromberg and Don Ayer became\nquite involved. Bromberg and Ayer in particular had a common view\nabout how this case would be won: We would only win, they repeatedly\ntold me, if we could make the issue seem \"important\" to the Supreme\nCourt. It had to seem as if dramatic harm were being done to free\nspeech and free culture; otherwise, they would never vote against \"the\nmost powerful media companies in the world.\"\nI hate this view of the law. Of course I thought the Sonny Bono Act\nwas a dramatic harm to free speech and free culture. Of course I still\nthink it is. But the idea that the Supreme Court decides the law based\non how important they believe the issues are is just wrong. It might be\n\"right\" as in \"true,\" I thought, but it is \"wrong\" as in \"it just shouldn't be\nthat way.\" As I believed that any faithful interpretation of what the\nframers of our Constitution did would yield the conclusion that the\nCTEA was unconstitutional, and as I believed that any faithful in\nterpretation of what the First Amendment means would yield the\nconclusion that the power to extend existing copyright terms is uncon\nstitutional, I was not persuaded that we had to sell our case like soap.\nJust as a law that bans the swastika is unconstitutional not because the\nCourt likes Nazis but because such a law would violate the Constitu\ntion, so too, in my view, would the Court decide whether Congress's\nlaw was constitutional based on the Constitution, not based on whether\nthey liked the values that the framers put in the Constitution.\nIn any case, I thought, the Court must already see the danger and\nthe harm caused by this sort of law. Why else would they grant review?\nThere was no reason to hear the case in the Supreme Court if they\nweren't convinced that this regulation was harmful. So in my view, we\ndidn't need to persuade them that this law was bad, we needed to show\nwhy it was unconstitutional.\nThere was one way, however, in which I felt politics would matter\n230 FREE CULTURE\n\nand in which I thought a response was appropriate. I was convinced\nthat the Court would not hear our arguments if it thought these were\njust the arguments of a group of lefty loons. This Supreme Court was\nnot about to launch into a new field of judicial review if it seemed that\nthis field of review was simply the preference of a small political minor\nity. Although my focus in the case was not to demonstrate how bad the\nSonny Bono Act was but to demonstrate that it was unconstitutional,\nmy hope was to make this argument against a background of briefs that\ncovered the full range of political views. To show that this claim against\nthe CTEA was grounded in law and not politics, then, we tried to\ngather the widest range of credible critics--credible not because they\nwere rich and famous, but because they, in the aggregate, demonstrated\nthat this law was unconstitutional regardless of one's politics.\nThe first step happened all by itself. Phyllis Schlafly's organization,\nEagle Forum, had been an opponent of the CTEA from the very be\nginning. Mrs. Schlafly viewed the CTEA as a sellout by Congress. In\nNovember 1998, she wrote a stinging editorial attacking the Repub\nlican Congress for allowing the law to pass. As she wrote, \"Do you\nsometimes wonder why bills that create a financial windfall to narrow\nspecial interests slide easily through the intricate legislative process,\nwhile bills that benefit the general public seem to get bogged down?\"\nThe answer, as the editorial documented, was the power of money.\nSchlafly enumerated Disney's contributions to the key players on the\ncommittees. It was money, not justice, that gave Mickey Mouse twenty\nmore years in Disney's control, Schlafly argued.\nIn the Court of Appeals, Eagle Forum was eager to file a brief sup\nporting our position. Their brief made the argument that became the\ncore claim in the Supreme Court: If Congress can extend the term of\nexisting copyrights, there is no limit to Congress's power to set terms.\nThat strong conservative argument persuaded a strong conservative\njudge, Judge Sentelle.\nIn the Supreme Court, the briefs on our side were about as diverse\nas it gets. They included an extraordinary historical brief by the Free\nBALANCES 231\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nSoftware Foundation (home of the GNU project that made GNU/\nLinux possible). They included a powerful brief about the costs of un\ncertainty by Intel. There were two law professors' briefs, one by copy\nright scholars and one by First Amendment scholars. There was an\nexhaustive and uncontroverted brief by the world's experts in the his\ntory of the Progress Clause. And of course, there was a new brief by\nEagle Forum, repeating and strengthening its arguments.\nThose briefs framed a legal argument. Then to support the legal\nargument, there were a number of powerful briefs by libraries and\narchives, including the Internet Archive, the American Association of\nLaw Libraries, and the National Writers Union.\nBut two briefs captured the policy argument best. One made the ar\ngument I've already described: A brief by Hal Roach Studios argued that\nunless the law was struck, a whole generation of American film would\ndisappear. The other made the economic argument absolutely clear.\nThis economists' brief was signed by seventeen economists, including\nfive Nobel Prize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan,\nMilton Friedman, Kenneth Arrow, and George Akerlof. The econo\nmists, as the list of Nobel winners demonstrates, spanned the political\nspectrum. Their conclusions were powerful: There was no plausible\nclaim that extending the terms of existing copyrights would do anything\nto increase incentives to create. Such extensions were nothing more\nthan \"rent-seeking\"--the fancy term economists use to describe\nspecial-interest legislation gone wild.\nThe same effort at balance was reflected in the legal team we gath\nered to write our briefs in the case. The Jones Day lawyers had been\nwith us from the start. But when the case got to the Supreme Court,\nwe added three lawyers to help us frame this argument to this Court:\nAlan Morrison, a lawyer from Public Citizen, a Washington group\nthat had made constitutional history with a series of seminal victories\nin the Supreme Court defending individual rights; my colleague and\ndean, Kathleen Sullivan, who had argued many cases in the Court, and\n232 FREE CULTURE\n\nwho had advised us early on about a First Amendment strategy; and fi\nnally, former solicitor general Charles Fried.\nFried was a special victory for our side. Every other former solicitor\ngeneral was hired by the other side to defend Congress's power to give\nmedia companies the special favor of extended copyright terms. Fried\nwas the only one who turned down that lucrative assignment to stand\nup for something he believed in. He had been Ronald Reagan's chief\nlawyer in the Supreme Court. He had helped craft the line of cases that\nlimited Congress's power in the context of the Commerce Clause. And\nwhile he had argued many positions in the Supreme Court that I per\nsonally disagreed with, his joining the cause was a vote of confidence in\nour argument.\nThe government, in defending the statute, had its collection of\nfriends, as well. Significantly, however, none of these \"friends\" included\nhistorians or economists. The briefs on the other side of the case were\nwritten exclusively by major media companies, congressmen, and\ncopyright holders.\nThe media companies were not surprising. They had the most to\ngain from the law. The congressmen were not surprising either--they\nwere defending their power and, indirectly, the gravy train of contribu\ntions such power induced. And of course it was not surprising that the\ncopyright holders would defend the idea that they should continue to\nhave the right to control who did what with content they wanted to\ncontrol.\nDr. Seuss's representatives, for example, argued that it was better for\nthe Dr. Seuss estate to control what happened to Dr. Seuss's work--\nbetter than allowing it to fall into the public domain--because if this\ncreativity were in the public domain, then people could use it to \"glo\nrify drugs or to create pornography.\"14 That was also the motive of\nthe Gershwin estate, which defended its \"protection\" of the work of\nGeorge Gershwin. They refuse, for example, to license Porgy and Bess\nto anyone who refuses to use African Americans in the cast.15 That's\nBALANCES 233\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\ntheir view of how this part of American culture should be controlled,\nand they wanted this law to help them effect that control.\nThis argument made clear a theme that is rarely noticed in this de\nbate. When Congress decides to extend the term of existing copy\nrights, Congress is making a choice about which speakers it will favor.\nFamous and beloved copyright owners, such as the Gershwin estate\nand Dr. Seuss, come to Congress and say, \"Give us twenty years to con\ntrol the speech about these icons of American culture. We'll do better\nwith them than anyone else.\" Congress of course likes to reward the\npopular and famous by giving them what they want. But when Con\ngress gives people an exclusive right to speak in a certain way, that's just\nwhat the First Amendment is traditionally meant to block.\nWe argued as much in a final brief. Not only would upholding the\nCTEA mean that there was no limit to the power of Congress to extend\ncopyrights--extensions that would further concentrate the market; it\nwould also mean that there was no limit to Congress's power to play fa\nvorites, through copyright, with who has the right to speak.\nBetween February and October, there was little I did beyond\npreparing for this case. Early on, as I said, I set the strategy.\nThe Supreme Court was divided into two important camps. One\ncamp we called \"the Conservatives.\" The other we called \"the Rest.\"\nThe Conservatives included Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor,\nJustice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas. These five had\nbeen the most consistent in limiting Congress's power. They were the\nfive who had supported the Lopez/Morrison line of cases that said that\nan enumerated power had to be interpreted to assure that Congress's\npowers had limits.\nThe Rest were the four Justices who had strongly opposed limits on\nCongress's power. These four--Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice\nGinsburg, and Justice Breyer--had repeatedly argued that the Consti\ntution gives Congress broad discretion to decide how best to imple\n234 FREE CULTURE\n\nment its powers. In case after case, these justices had argued that the\nCourt's role should be one of deference. Though the votes of these four\njustices were the votes that I personally had most consistently agreed\nwith, they were also the votes that we were least likely to get.\nIn particular, the least likely was Justice Ginsburg's. In addition to\nher general view about deference to Congress (except where issues of\ngender are involved), she had been particularly deferential in the con\ntext of intellectual property protections. She and her daughter (an ex\ncellent and well-known intellectual property scholar) were cut from\nthe same intellectual property cloth. We expected she would agree with\nthe writings of her daughter: that Congress had the power in this con\ntext to do as it wished, even if what Congress wished made little sense.\nClose behind Justice Ginsburg were two justices whom we also\nviewed as unlikely allies, though possible surprises. Justice Souter\nstrongly favored deference to Congress, as did Justice Breyer. But both\nwere also very sensitive to free speech concerns. And as we strongly be\nlieved, there was a very important free speech argument against these\nretrospective extensions.\nThe only vote we could be confident about was that of Justice\nStevens. History will record Justice Stevens as one of the greatest\njudges on this Court. His votes are consistently eclectic, which just\nmeans that no simple ideology explains where he will stand. But he\nhad consistently argued for limits in the context of intellectual property\ngenerally. We were fairly confident he would recognize limits here.\nThis analysis of \"the Rest\" showed most clearly where our focus\nhad to be: on the Conservatives. To win this case, we had to crack open\nthese five and get at least a majority to go our way.Thus, the single over\nriding argument that animated our claim rested on the Conservatives'\nmost important jurisprudential innovation--the argument that Judge\nSentelle had relied upon in the Court of Appeals, that Congress's power\nmust be interpreted so that its enumerated powers have limits.\nThis then was the core of our strategy--a strategy for which I am\nresponsible. We would get the Court to see that just as with the Lopez\nBALANCES 235\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\ncase, under the government's argument here, Congress would always\nhave unlimited power to extend existing terms. If anything was plain\nabout Congress's power under the Progress Clause, it was that this\npower was supposed to be \"limited.\" Our aim would be to get the\nCourt to reconcile Eldred with Lopez: If Congress's power to regulate\ncommerce was limited, then so, too, must Congress's power to regulate\ncopyright be limited.\nThe argument on the government's side came down to this: Con\ngress has done it before. It should be allowed to do it again. The gov\nernment claimed that from the very beginning, Congress has been\nextending the term of existing copyrights. So, the government argued,\nthe Court should not now say that practice is unconstitutional.\nThere was some truth to the government's claim, but not much. We\ncertainly agreed that Congress had extended existing terms in 1831\nand in 1909. And of course, in 1962, Congress began extending exist\ning terms regularly--eleven times in forty years.\nBut this \"consistency\" should be kept in perspective. Congress ex\ntended existing terms once in the first hundred years of the Republic.\nIt then extended existing terms once again in the next fifty. Those rare\nextensions are in contrast to the now regular practice of extending ex\nisting terms. Whatever restraint Congress had had in the past, that re\nstraint was now gone. Congress was now in a cycle of extensions; there\nwas no reason to expect that cycle would end. This Court had not hes\nitated to intervene where Congress was in a similar cycle of extension.\nThere was no reason it couldn't intervene here.\nOral argument was scheduled for the first week in October. I ar\nrived in D.C. two weeks before the argument. During those two\nweeks, I was repeatedly \"mooted\" by lawyers who had volunteered to\n236 FREE CULTURE\n\nhelp in the case. Such \"moots\" are basically practice rounds, where\nwannabe justices fire questions at wannabe winners.\nI was convinced that to win, I had to keep the Court focused on a\nsingle point: that if this extension is permitted, then there is no limit to\nthe power to set terms. Going with the government would mean that\nterms would be effectively unlimited; going with us would give Con\ngress a clear line to follow: Don't extend existing terms. The moots\nwere an effective practice; I found ways to take every question back to\nthis central idea.\nOne moot was before the lawyers at Jones Day. Don Ayer was the\nskeptic. He had served in the Reagan Justice Department with So\nlicitor General Charles Fried. He had argued many cases before the\nSupreme Court. And in his review of the moot, he let his concern\nspeak:\n\"I'm just afraid that unless they really see the harm, they won't be\nwilling to upset this practice that the government says has been a con\nsistent practice for two hundred years. You have to make them see the\nharm--passionately get them to see the harm. For if they don't see\nthat, then we haven't any chance of winning.\"\nHe may have argued many cases before this Court, I thought, but\nhe didn't understand its soul. As a clerk, I had seen the Justices do the\nright thing--not because of politics but because it was right. As a law\nprofessor, I had spent my life teaching my students that this Court\ndoes the right thing--not because of politics but because it is right. As\nI listened to Ayer's plea for passion in pressing politics, I understood\nhis point, and I rejected it. Our argument was right. That was enough.\nLet the politicians learn to see that it was also good.\nThe night before the argument, a line of people began to form\nin front of the Supreme Court. The case had become a focus of the\npress and of the movement to free culture. Hundreds stood in line\nBALANCES 237\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nfor the chance to see the proceedings. Scores spent the night on the\nSupreme Court steps so that they would be assured a seat.\nNot everyone has to wait in line. People who know the Justices can\nask for seats they control. (I asked Justice Scalia's chambers for seats for\nmy parents, for example.) Members of the Supreme Court bar can get\na seat in a special section reserved for them. And senators and con\ngressmen have a special place where they get to sit, too. And finally, of\ncourse, the press has a gallery, as do clerks working for the Justices on\nthe Court. As we entered that morning, there was no place that was\nnot taken. This was an argument about intellectual property law, yet\nthe halls were filled. As I walked in to take my seat at the front of the\nCourt, I saw my parents sitting on the left. As I sat down at the table,\nI saw Jack Valenti sitting in the special section ordinarily reserved for\nfamily of the Justices.\nWhen the Chief Justice called me to begin my argument, I began\nwhere I intended to stay: on the question of the limits on Congress's\npower. This was a case about enumerated powers, I said, and whether\nthose enumerated powers had any limit.\nJustice O'Connor stopped me within one minute of my opening.\nThe history was bothering her.\njustice o'connor: Congress has extended the term so often\nthrough the years, and if you are right, don't we run the risk of\nupsetting previous extensions of time? I mean, this seems to be a\npractice that began with the very first act.\nShe was quite willing to concede \"that this flies directly in the face\nof what the framers had in mind.\" But my response again and again\nwas to emphasize limits on Congress's power.\nmr. lessig: Well, if it flies in the face of what the framers had in\nmind, then the question is, is there a way of interpreting their\n238 FREE CULTURE\n\nwords that gives effect to what they had in mind, and the answer\nis yes.\nThere were two points in this argument when I should have seen\nwhere the Court was going. The first was a question by Justice\nKennedy, who observed,\njustice kennedy: Well, I suppose implicit in the argument that\nthe '76 act, too, should have been declared void, and that we\nmight leave it alone because of the disruption, is that for all these\nyears the act has impeded progress in science and the useful arts.\nI just don't see any empirical evidence for that.\nHere follows my clear mistake. Like a professor correcting a stu\ndent, I answered,\nmr. lessig: Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all.\nNothing in our Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical\nassertion about impeding progress. Our only argument is this is a\nstructural limit necessary to assure that what would be an effec\ntively perpetual term not be permitted under the copyright laws.\nThat was a correct answer, but it wasn't the right answer. The right\nanswer was instead that there was an obvious and profound harm. Any\nnumber of briefs had been written about it. He wanted to hear it. And\nhere was the place Don Ayer's advice should have mattered. This was a\nsoftball; my answer was a swing and a miss.\nThe second came from the Chief, for whom the whole case had\nbeen crafted. For the Chief Justice had crafted the Lopez ruling, and we\nhoped that he would see this case as its second cousin.\nIt was clear a second into his question that he wasn't at all sympa\nthetic. To him, we were a bunch of anarchists. As he asked:\nBALANCES 239\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nchief justice: Well, but you want more than that. You want the\nright to copy verbatim other people's books, don't you?\nmr. lessig: We want the right to copy verbatim works that\nshould be in the public domain and would be in the public do\nmain but for a statute that cannot be justified under ordinary First\nAmendment analysis or under a proper reading of the limits built\ninto the Copyright Clause.\nThings went better for us when the government gave its argument;\nfor now the Court picked up on the core of our claim. As Justice Scalia\nasked Solicitor General Olson,\njustice scalia: You say that the functional equivalent of an un\nlimited time would be a violation [of the Constitution], but that's\nprecisely the argument that's being made by petitioners here, that\na limited time which is extendable is the functional equivalent of\nan unlimited time.\nWhen Olson was finished, it was my turn to give a closing rebuttal.\nOlson's flailing had revived my anger. But my anger still was directed\nto the academic, not the practical. The government was arguing as if\nthis were the first case ever to consider limits on Congress's Copyright\nand Patent Clause power. Ever the professor and not the advocate, I\nclosed by pointing out the long history of the Court imposing limits on\nCongress's power in the name of the Copyright and Patent Clause--\nindeed, the very first case striking a law of Congress as exceeding a spe\ncific enumerated power was based upon the Copyright and Patent\nClause. All true. But it wasn't going to move the Court to my side.\nAs I left the court that day, I knew there were a hundred points I\nwished I could remake. There were a hundred questions I wished I had\n240 FREE CULTURE\n\nanswered differently. But one way of thinking about this case left me\noptimistic.\nThe government had been asked over and over again, what is the\nlimit? Over and over again, it had answered there is no limit. This\nwas precisely the answer I wanted the Court to hear. For I could not\nimagine how the Court could understand that the government be\nlieved Congress's power was unlimited under the terms of the Copy\nright Clause, and sustain the government's argument. The solicitor\ngeneral had made my argument for me. No matter how often I tried,\nI could not understand how the Court could find that Congress's\npower under the Commerce Clause was limited, but under the Copy\nright Clause, unlimited. In those rare moments when I let myself be\nlieve that we may have prevailed, it was because I felt this Court--in\nparticular, the Conservatives--would feel itself constrained by the rule\nof law that it had established elsewhere.\nThe morning of January 15, 2003, I was five minutes late to the office\nand missed the 7:00 A.M. call from the Supreme Court clerk. Listening to\nthe message,I could tell in an instant that she had bad news to report.The\nSupreme Court had affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Seven\njustices had voted in the majority. There were two dissents.\nA few seconds later, the opinions arrived by e-mail. I took the\nphone off the hook, posted an announcement to our blog, and sat\ndown to see where I had been wrong in my reasoning.\nMy reasoning. Here was a case that pitted all the money in the\nworld against reasoning. And here was the last naive law professor,\nscouring the pages, looking for reasoning.\nI first scoured the opinion, looking for how the Court would dis\ntinguish the principle in this case from the principle in Lopez. The ar\ngument was nowhere to be found. The case was not even cited. The\nargument that was the core argument of our case did not even appear\nin the Court's opinion.\nBALANCES 241\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nJustice Ginsburg simply ignored the enumerated powers argument.\nConsistent with her view that Congress's power was not limited gener\nally, she had found Congress's power not limited here.\nHer opinion was perfectly reasonable--for her, and for Justice\nSouter. Neither believes in Lopez. It would be too much to expect them\nto write an opinion that recognized, much less explained, the doctrine\nthey had worked so hard to defeat.\nBut as I realized what had happened, I couldn't quite believe what I\nwas reading. I had said there was no way this Court could reconcile\nlimited powers with the Commerce Clause and unlimited powers with\nthe Progress Clause. It had never even occurred to me that they could\nreconcile the two simply by not addressing the argument. There was no\ninconsistency because they would not talk about the two together.\nThere was therefore no principle that followed from the Lopez case: In\nthat context, Congress's power would be limited, but in this context it\nwould not.\nYet by what right did they get to choose which of the framers' val\nues they would respect? By what right did they--the silent five--get to\nselect the part of the Constitution they would enforce based on the val\nues they thought important? We were right back to the argument that\nI said I hated at the start: I had failed to convince them that the issue\nhere was important, and I had failed to recognize that however much I\nmight hate a system in which the Court gets to pick the constitutional\nvalues that it will respect, that is the system we have.\nJustices Breyer and Stevens wrote very strong dissents. Stevens's\nopinion was crafted internal to the law: He argued that the tradition of\nintellectual property law should not support this unjustified extension\nof terms. He based his argument on a parallel analysis that had gov\nerned in the context of patents (so had we). But the rest of the Court\ndiscounted the parallel--without explaining how the very same words\nin the Progress Clause could come to mean totally different things de\npending upon whether the words were about patents or copyrights.\nThe Court let Justice Stevens's charge go unanswered.\n242 FREE CULTURE\n\nJustice Breyer's opinion, perhaps the best opinion he has ever writ\nten, was external to the Constitution. He argued that the term of copy\nrights has become so long as to be effectively unlimited. We had said\nthat under the current term, a copyright gave an author 99.8 percent of\nthe value of a perpetual term. Breyer said we were wrong, that the ac\ntual number was 99.9997 percent of a perpetual term. Either way, the\npoint was clear: If the Constitution said a term had to be \"limited,\" and\nthe existing term was so long as to be effectively unlimited, then it was\nunconstitutional.\nThese two justices understood all the arguments we had made. But\nbecause neither believed in the Lopez case, neither was willing to push\nit as a reason to reject this extension. The case was decided without\nanyone having addressed the argument that we had carried from Judge\nSentelle. It was Hamlet without the Prince.\nDefeat brings depression. They say it is a sign of health when\ndepression gives way to anger. My anger came quickly, but it didn't cure\nthe depression. This anger was of two sorts.\nIt was first anger with the five \"Conservatives.\" It would have been\none thing for them to have explained why the principle of Lopez didn't\napply in this case. That wouldn't have been a very convincing argu\nment, I don't believe, having read it made by others, and having tried\nto make it myself. But it at least would have been an act of integrity.\nThese justices in particular have repeatedly said that the proper mode\nof interpreting the Constitution is \"originalism\"--to first understand\nthe framers' text, interpreted in their context, in light of the structure\nof the Constitution. That method had produced Lopez and many other\n\"originalist\" rulings. Where was their \"originalism\" now?\nHere, they had joined an opinion that never once tried to explain\nwhat the framers had meant by crafting the Progress Clause as they\ndid; they joined an opinion that never once tried to explain how the\nstructure of that clause would affect the interpretation of Congress's\nBALANCES 243\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\npower. And they joined an opinion that didn't even try to explain why\nthis grant of power could be unlimited, whereas the Commerce Clause\nwould be limited. In short, they had joined an opinion that did not ap\nply to, and was inconsistent with, their own method for interpreting\nthe Constitution. This opinion may well have yielded a result that they\nliked. It did not produce a reason that was consistent with their own\nprinciples.\nMy anger with the Conservatives quickly yielded to anger with my\nself. For I had let a view of the law that I liked interfere with a view of\nthe law as it is.\nMost lawyers, and most law professors, have little patience for ide\nalism about courts in general and this Supreme Court in particular.\nMost have a much more pragmatic view. When Don Ayer said that\nthis case would be won based on whether I could convince the Justices\nthat the framers' values were important, I fought the idea, because I\ndidn't want to believe that that is how this Court decides. I insisted on\narguing this case as if it were a simple application of a set of principles.\nI had an argument that followed in logic. I didn't need to waste my\ntime showing it should also follow in popularity.\nAs I read back over the transcript from that argument in October, I\ncan see a hundred places where the answers could have taken the con\nversation in different directions, where the truth about the harm that\nthis unchecked power will cause could have been made clear to this\nCourt. Justice Kennedy in good faith wanted to be shown. I, idiotically,\ncorrected his question. Justice Souter in good faith wanted to be shown\nthe First Amendment harms. I, like a math teacher, reframed the ques\ntion to make the logical point. I had shown them how they could strike\nthis law of Congress if they wanted to. There were a hundred places\nwhere I could have helped them want to, yet my stubbornness, my re\nfusal to give in, stopped me. I have stood before hundreds of audiences\ntrying to persuade; I have used passion in that effort to persuade; but I\nrefused to stand before this audience and try to persuade with the pas\n244 FREE CULTURE\n\nsion I had used elsewhere. It was not the basis on which a court should\ndecide the issue.\nWould it have been different if I had argued it differently? Would it\nhave been different if Don Ayer had argued it? Or Charles Fried? Or\nKathleen Sullivan?\nMy friends huddled around me to insist it would not. The Court\nwas not ready, my friends insisted. This was a loss that was destined. It\nwould take a great deal more to show our society why our framers were\nright. And when we do that, we will be able to show that Court.\nMaybe, but I doubt it. These Justices have no financial interest in\ndoing anything except the right thing. They are not lobbied. They have\nlittle reason to resist doing right. I can't help but think that if I had\nstepped down from this pretty picture of dispassionate justice, I could\nhave persuaded.\nAnd even if I couldn't, then that doesn't excuse what happened in\nJanuary. For at the start of this case, one of America's leading intellec\ntual property professors stated publicly that my bringing this case was\na mistake. \"The Court is not ready,\" Peter Jaszi said; this issue should\nnot be raised until it is.\nAfter the argument and after the decision, Peter said to me, and\npublicly, that he was wrong. But if indeed that Court could not have\nbeen persuaded, then that is all the evidence that's needed to know that\nhere again Peter was right. Either I was not ready to argue this case in\na way that would do some good or they were not ready to hear this case\nin a way that would do some good. Either way, the decision to bring\nthis case--a decision I had made four years before--was wrong.\nWhile the reaction to the Sonny Bono Act itself was almost\nunanimously negative, the reaction to the Court's decision was mixed.\nNo one, at least in the press, tried to say that extending the term of\ncopyright was a good idea. We had won that battle over ideas. Where\nBALANCES 245\n\n<http://free-culture.org/get-it>\nthe decision was praised, it was praised by papers that had been skep\ntical of the Court's activism in other cases. Deference was a good thing,\neven if it left standing a silly law. But where the decision was attacked,\nit was attacked because it left standing a silly and harmful law. The New\nYork Times wrote in its editorial,\nIn effect, the Supreme Court's decision makes it likely that we are\nseeing the beginning of the end of public domain and the birth of\ncopyright perpetuity. The public domain has been a grand exper\niment, one that should not be allowed to die. The ability to draw\nfreely on the entire creative output of humanity is one of the rea\nsons we live in a time of such fruitful creative ferment.\nThe best responses were in the cartoons. There was a gaggle of hi\nlarious images--of Mickey in jail and the like. The best, from my view\nof the case, was Ruben Bolling's, reproduced on the next page. The\n\"powerful and wealthy\" line is a bit unfair. But the punch in the face felt\nexactly like that.\nThe image that will always stick in my head is that evoked by the\nquote from The New York Times. That \"grand experiment\" we call the\n\"public domain\" is over? When I can make light of it, I think, \"Honey,\nI shrunk the Constitution.\" But I can rarely make light of it. We had in\nour Constitution a commitment to free culture. In the case that I fa\nthered, the Supreme Court effectively renounced that commitment. A\nbetter lawyer would have made them see differently.\n246 FREE CULTURE\n\nBALANCES 247\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n21M.380 Music and Technology (Contemporary History and Aesthetics)\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
