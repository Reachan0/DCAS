Specifically, these\nanalyses were conceived to establish (a) the contributions of\nthe genotypes at the four COMT polymorphisms to\ncomprehension difficulties ( present = 1, absent =0), (b) the\ncontribution of maternal rejection ( present =1, absent = 0) to\ncomprehension difficulties, and (c) interactive contributions of\ngenotypes and maternal rejection to comprehension difficulties.\n\nDAT1\n\nPrevious research has generated examples of how genetic and\nenvironmental factors can interact to create risk for psychopathology.\n\nUsing a gene-by-environment (G E) interaction design, theytested\nwhether three polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene\n(DAT1, also referred to as SLC6A3, located at 5p15.33) interacted\nwith maternal parenting style to predict first onset episodes of\ndepression.\n\nParticipants were male adolescents (176) recruited from a juvenile\ndetention center in northern Russia.\n\nAs hypothesized, one of the polymorphisms (rs40184) moderated the\neffect of perceived maternal rejection on the onset of major\ndepressive disorder, as well as on suicidal ideation.\n\nFurther, this G E interaction was specific to depression; it did not\npredict clinically significant anxiety.\nHaeffel et al 2008\n\nDA in Schizophrenia\nHeritability of Schizophrenia = 80%!\nCognitive Impairments (remain stable) in WM,\nlearning, verbal fluency, motor speed, executive\nfunctions\nfMRI studies of above: abnormalities of dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial temporal lobe,\nhippocampus, anterior cingulate, medial frontal and\nposterior parietal cortex, striatum, thalamus,\ncerebellum\nRoss, Margolis, Reading et al 2006\n\nDA in Schizophrenia\nSchizophrenics have increased release of DA and\nincreased density and occupancy of D2R in striatum\nMost antipsychotics = block D2R (chlorpromazine,\nhaloperidol, perphenazine - but all cause neurologic\nsymptoms: tremor, rigidity, dystonia, dyskinesia)\nImprove positive symptoms (hallucinations,\ndelusions)\nVery modest effect on cognitive symptoms (?!)\n\nCOMT polymorphisms\nCOMT polymorphisms's role is debated in this and other\npsychiatric disorders - lots of negative/inconclusive evidence\nlongitudinal study of the Dunedin birth cohort followed to\nadulthood carriers of the COMT Val allelewere most likely to\nexhibit psychotic symptoms andto develop schizophreniform\ndisorder if they used cannabis, whereas cannabis use had no\nsuch adverse influence on individuals with two copies of the\nMet allele\na family-based association study of 240 ADHD sufferers,\nbearers of the Val/Val genotype were substantially more\nsusceptible to the adverse effects of prenatal risk (indexed by\nlow birth weight) in influencing risk of early-onset antisocial\nbehaviour.\n\nDrawing of the pref\nrontal cortex and t\nhe associated parts\n.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nD2R overexpression\nKellendonk et al 2006\nwhen crossed to CamKIIa-tTA mice, about 20% of tetO responder lines give rise\nto tetO-driven transgene expression restricted to the striatum and olfactory tubercle\nCourtesy of Elsevier, Inc., http://www.sciencedirect.com.

MAOI arose from antitubercular drugs\n- More recently, led to the discovery of serotonin-selective\nreuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and norepinephrine-selective\ninhibitors.\n\nAntidepressants\nmechanisms of action\n- MAOIs block monoamine oxidase (MAO), so it\ninhibits 5-HT and norepinephrine metabolism\n- TCAs block reuptake pumps for 5-HT and/or\nnorepinephrine; they cannot be reshuttled back into\nthe synaptic neuron; they alter the sensitivity of some\n5-HT and norepinephrine receptors\n- SSRIs block reuptake pump for 5-HT, 5-HT cannot\nbe reshuttled back in the synaptic neuron\n\nTCA action\n\nSSRI + MAOI - action\n\nSSRIs\n-\ncitalopram (Celexa, Cipramil, Dalsan, Recital, Emocal, Sepram,\nSeropram)\n-\ndapoxetine (no trade name yet;
