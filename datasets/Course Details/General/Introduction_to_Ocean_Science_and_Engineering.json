Hands-on projects focus on instrumentation in the marine environment and the design of ocean observatories for ocean monitoring and exploration. Topics include acoustics, sound speed and refraction, sounds generated by ships and marine animals, sonar systems and their principles of operation, hydrostatic behavior of floating and submerged bodies geared towards ocean vehicle design, stability of ocean vessels, and the application of instrumentation and electronics in the marine environment. Students work with sensor systems and deploy them in the field to gather and analyze real world data.\n\nThe goal of this course is to give each student an introduction to fundamental ocean science, hydrodynamics, acoustics and ocean instrumentation and measurement. This introduction will serve as a spring board for future ocean related coursework and should help students sufficient background to \"place\" the importance of their future classes in the context of ocean science and engineering and current research trends.\n\nPedagogy\n\nThis conference paper describes several teaching innovations embodied in this course:\n\nTechet, A. H., T. T. Truscott, and M. K. Thompson. \"\nIntegration of hands-on laboratory modules to enhance the introduction of ocean science and engineering to undergraduates\n.\"\nProceedings of IEEE/MTS Oceans/Boston 2006 Conference\n, September 2006.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nMIT courses 8.01 and 18.02.\n\nHomework\n\nHomework assignments will be distributed weekly. A portion of the assignment will cover material not yet addressed in lecture and will require some independent study (e.g. reading the suggested text). The remainder of the assignment will re-cover and re-emphasize the material covered in lectures. Homework should be a result of individual effort. Homework will be due one week from their date of assignment.\n\nLaboratories\n\nLab safety and rules must be followed at all times. Lab assignments will include self-directed projects and instructor directed assignments. Laboratory grades will be based on written and oral reports as well as in-class participation and effort. The laboratory staff will be available for help with the assignments where necessary. If you don't know how to use a piece of equipment,\nask\nthe instructor before using it! Report all emergencies and accidents to the instructor and laboratory head within 12 hours of their occurrence.\n\nExams\n\nThere will be two exams during the term. The first exam will be in class, and the second exam will be a take-home exam due one week after its distribution.\n\nGrading\n\nActivities\n\nPercentages\n\nLaboratories/Projects\n\n40%\n\nHomeworks\n\n20%\n\nExams\n\n40%\n\nTextbooks\n\nThe required text for the course is freely available online.\n\nStewart, Robert.\nIntroduction to Physical Oceanography\n.

      "content": "2.011\n3/13/06\nHW# 2 Solution Set\nProblem 1: (10 points)\na. (3 points) Three points for something feasible (actually anything will do here). 1\npoint for something useful or convincing.\nb. (4 points) One point for description, two for spatial and temporal scales, and one\nfor expected results.\nc. (3 points) Three points for cost.\nProblem 2: (10 points)\na. (2 points) The deepest part of the ocean is The Marianas Trench between 10,911\nm (Kaiko March 24th, 1995), which is the most accurate reading. Other reports are\ndeeper by as much as 11,040.04. As a comparison Mt. Everest is 8444.43 m high.\nLocated at approximately 11o 19'N latitude and 142 15'E longitude, in the Pacific\nOcean.\nb. (2 points) 1o latitude = 111 km. 1o longitude = 111 cosine (latitude) km. Pg 21\nST.\nc. (3 points) The speed of sound in water is a function of temperature, depth, and\nsalinity. Pg 35 ST.\nd. (3 points) From Pg 35 ST. If the speed of sound is plotted as a function of depth\nthere is usually a minimum around 1000m. The depth of minimum sound speed\nis the sound channel. A sound channel can carry sound up to 10,000 km away.\nIt occurs in all oceans, and it usually reaches the surface at higher latitudes. In the\nsound channel sound can travel very far, sometimes half way around the earth.\nSound rays that begin to travel outside the channel are directed back to the sound\nchannel. I like to think of it as a large fiber optic cable for sound.\nProblem 3: (10 points)\na. (2 points) The Pacific (according to Google Earth) along the equator lies at 80o 6'\n34 W and 103o 48' 46 E, which is 19565 km or 12157.6 miles (~183o 54'). This\nis an assumption that the earth is generally spherical and uses google earth.\nb. (2 points) Google Earth.\nc. (2 points) The accuracy is down to the sub second according to google. I trust it to\nthe second, which is much better than the degree accuracy we are looking for. Of\ncourse the South American landing of the reading is very close to a river delta and\ncould be growing or shrinking by some amount each year!\nd. (2 points) I have a good feeling that this is within 1o of accuracy, because I was\nable to get sub second resolution using google earth. I gave everyone points for\nbeing close.\ne. (2 points) They go north because that happens to be the shortest route. If you\ncould place a string on the earth from one point to another and pull it taught you\nwould see that the shortest distance to Tokyo from LA is to head north for a while\nand then turn south.\n\n2.011\n3/13/06\nProblem 4: (10 points)\na. (2 points) The sky is blue because the atmosphere scatters shorter frequency\nwavelengths (ie blue, violet), but lets wavelengths that are longer (reds, oranges,\nyellows) through with little or no scattering. (Wikipedia)\nb. (2 points) The sky near the horizon is much thicker than above. Therefore, in the\ndaytime the light near the horizon tends to be paler than above. In the evening as\nthe sunsets the sunlight appears even redder because the remaining wavelengths\n(longer) are filtered even further, thus filtering almost all the blues and greens\nleaving a very orange or red Sun. The scattering effect is known as Rayleigh law.\n(Wikipedia)\nc. (2 points) C=Î»*f (wave speed = wavelength * frequency)\nd. (2 points) Blue light = 430-500 nm, Green light = 520-565 nm, Red light = 625\n740 nm.\ne. (2 points) Blue light (~430nm) propagates furthest in water because it is the least\nabsorbed.\nProblem 5: (10 points)\na. (5 points) The direction of the winds is from the high-pressure zone to the low-\npressure zones. The 30oN and 30o S high-pressure regions blow towards the\nequator. The equatorial region tends to blow towards the west because of the\nconverging winds from the north and south. Pg. 41 ST.\nb. (5 points) The highest evaporation occurs around the 30oN and 30oS latitudes.\nThe equatorial region has heavy precipitation. Pg. 41 ST.\nProblem 6: (10 points)\na. (4 points) In general, the warmest surface temperatures are found at the equator\n~30o C. The heat gradually dissipates to ~23oC near the 30oN and 30oS longitude\nlines. Near the poles have the coldest surface temperatures -1oC. The moderate\ntemperatures (23oC - 10oC) occur between 30oN and ~55oN in the north and 30oS\nto 55oS. The rest of the water is cold toward the poles and varies from 10oC to -\n1oC. There are irregularities to this trend. In the Pacific along the equator near\nEquador has colder water below 23oC and extends from the coast ~10o longitude.\nThe Pacific coast of South America and the Atlantic coast of Africa are 10o\ncolder than the rest of the ocean at that latitude. There is also a 10o cooler region\nalong the pacific coast of America and Atlantic coast Europe. Together these\nregions narrow the warm surface temperatures region found at the higher\nlatitudes. The western Pacific is warmer on average than the eastern portion. The\nIndian ocean is dominated by 30oC temperatures.\nb. (4 points) The main cause of the ocean surface temperature is the sun. The sun\nheats the water through isolation. The ocean releases heat in the form of\nradiation. The average temperature of the sea relates to the intensity of the\nsunlight at that region. The sun reaches the earth most directly at the equator with\ndecreasing angles of incidence at the increasing latitudes. In general, this\nassumption is valid. The irregularities are due to wind driven currents and\nseparately from deep waters coming to the surface. For instance, along the\nequator the winds are typically westerly. This causes the warm waters along the\nWestern coast of the Americas to move eastward. To replace the movement of\n\n2.011\n3/13/06\nthose warm waters the cooler waters from higher latitudes move into those\nregions. They are of course heated but the cooler regions causes the narrowing of\nthe warm band along both the western coast of the Americas and the western\ncoast of Africa and Europe. The strange cold surface temperature off the coast of\nEquador may be explained as some upwelling of a cooler water from the deeper\nsea.\nc. (4 points) The simplest model is to say that the water temperature is linear decline\nof 30oC at 0o latitude to 24oC at 30oN and 30oS. Then taking another linear fit\nfrom 24oC at 30oN and 30oS to -1o at 90oN and 90oS. This is a very crude model\nbut in general works against the data. In general the sun affects the surface\ntemperature directly, which can vary if winds and currents are strong enough or\npersistent enough throughout the year. If you proposed a model that seemed\nreasonable I gave you full points. If you actually came up with an equation you\nget kudos.\nProblem 7: (10 points)\nFull points for mentioning your interests in this course."

It\nrepresents the ocean temperature averaged over many years. This means that the variations\nthat naturally occur during the year and during different years are not represented in this one\nplot. This kind of plot is very useful when the purpose of the investigation is to determine the\nlong-term patterns that persist for many decades, without being confused by shorter-term\nvariations.\nThe task: Your job is to write a short scientific discussion of the data shown in the figure\nabove and to develop a model explaining this data.\nAverage Annual Sea Surface Temperature\na. Describe: Describe the data found in the image above. Be brief, but don't miss\nimportant features. Look at the most obvious temperature variations. Possible\nreferences, for descriptive purposes, are the geographic position such as latitude,\nlongitude, size of the body of water, or distance from a continent.

      "content": "2.011\n3/16/06\nHW# 3 Solution Set\nProblem 1: (5 points)\nHeat can be transported to deeper layers in the ocean by diffusion (1), density\ngradients(1), turbulence (wind and waves)(1), and currents(1). Pg. 82 Stewart. I\ngave 1 more point if you discussed one of the physical mechanisms in more\ndetail.\nProblem 2: (8 points)\na. (4 points) In fresh water the densest water is 4oC so water that is colder than 4oC\ncan be found above the bottom 4oC layer. This is not the case in seawater. In sea\nwater above 25 o/oo the maximum density occurs below the freezing point,\nmeaning that warmer water always overlies cooler water in a gravitationally\nstable situation, the salinity makes them different.\nb. (4 points) Since the freshwater at 4o is the densest it makes sense that all other\nwater would be above this temperature if left to rest. So if a lake has water that is\n4oC or less in it then the bottom temperature will be 4oC.\nProblem 3: (2 points)\nS=35o/00\nProblem 4: (10 points)\na. (2 points) Air will have a higher potential because the pressure at the surface is\ngreater than at 5 km which means it would heat up, and water will have a lower\npotential because it would expand coming to the surface thus decreasing its\ntemperature.\nb. (2 points) (i) 27.6 (ii) 26.4.\nc.\ni. (1 points) Density and sigma are related by Ï=Ït+1000. Specific gravity is\nthe density of the water divided by the density of water at atmospheric\npressure Sg=Ï/1000 or Sg=1+Ït/1000. So (i) becomes 1.0276 and (ii)\n1.0264.\nii. (1 points) The density at atmospheric pressure is thus Ï=Ït+1000 [kg/m3].\nEssentially the numbers from the figure are the last two digits in the\ndensity for the water at that temperature and salinity. Therefore (i) is\n1027.6 kg/m3 and (ii) 1026.4 kg/m3.\nd. (2 points) Temperature has a greater effect on density in the ocean. From the\nfigure one can see that the slope of the line is fairly shallow. This means that\nalong lines of constant temperature the salinity can change greatly with little\nchange in density. However, for constant salinity if one changes the temperature\nthe density can change much more greatly. For example, if on varies the\ntemperature 10o one can get a change of nearly 8 kg/m3 however along constant\ntemperature a change of salinity by 1.5 o/oo only effects the density by 1.5 kg/m3.\n\n2.011\n3/16/06\nSurely a greater change in salinity may show a greater change in density, however\nsalinity in the ocean varies by as little as 2o/oo and so according to this figure\ntemperature has a greater effect on density than salinity.\nProblem 5: (10 points)\na. (2 points) The surface waters are much warmer than the deep ocean for latitudes\nfrom 50oS to 50o N. Beyond that the temperature gradient is fairly small. For\nlatitudes from 50oS to 20oN the water is saltiest near the surface then decreases to\n~1000 m then slightly increases until the bottom. Above the 60o latitudes the\nwater salinity is nearly constant with respect to depth. The area between 20oN\nand 60 oN is saltier at the surface but has a small change from surface to bottom.\nIn general there is a steep gradient near the surface for both salinity and\ntemperature, then the gradient becomes much more gradual after ~1000m.\nb. (2 points) A corresponds to profile 1 and B to profile 2.\nc. (2 points) A corresponds to profile 1 and B to profile 2.\nd. (2 points) The haloclines and thermoclines seem to be similar in shape and depth\nexcept for the salinity minimums. These occur around 700 m in general whereas\nthe minimum temperature is always below 3000 - 4000 m.\ne. (2 points) B shows greater decrease in salinity with depth.\nProblem 6: (4 points)\na. (2 points) (i) matches with a, (ii) matches with\nb. (2 points) Figure (a) shows an increase in temperature below 4000m thus this\nmust be in situ temperature (description i), whereas figure (b) must correspond\nwith description (ii) b/c it shows cooler water near the bottom, and is thus the\npotential temperature part (corrected for adiabatic compression). The potential\ntemperature profiles and cross sections are more realistic b/c of these\ncorrections so description (ii) is correct.\nProblem 7: (8 points)\na. (2 points) Light propagates in ocean at 2.25E8 m/s2 and sound at 1.5E3\nm/s2, which means light travels 150,000 times faster than sound in water.\nb. (2 points) The difference in refractive indexes between air and water cause\nsome of the rays of the sun to be reflected from the surface of the water.\nWhenever two interfaces meet and light passes between them, they will\nalways reflect light if they do not have the same refractive index (albedo).\nFor the ocean 2% of the light is reflected from a light sourse directly\nabove the surface.\nc. (2 points) Light attenuation is very high in the ocean. This means that the\nlight is absorbed rapidly and that it doesn't reach very deep before the\nocean appears without light. Because the particles in the water absorb the\nenergy so well the water near the surface is much higher temperature than\ndeeper down. Light attenuates to a depth of about 200 m.\nhttp://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/04deepscope/background/deep\nlight/deeplight.html\n\n2.011\n3/16/06\nd. (2 points) Light is attenuated by particles in the water. Many waters\nappear blue, which can mean unproductive water or water that does not\nproduce a lot of microscopic life. Phytoplankton and algae absorb\ndifferent wavelengths of light and often change the color of the water from\nabove due to this absorption. When this happens it can often mean the\nwaters are more productive or full of microorganisms and appear blue\ngreen. It is also common to see brown waters near river inlets and deltas.\nThis is due to the absorption from the sediment in the water."

(2 points)The decibel (dB) is a measure of the ratio between two quantities, and is\nused in a wide variety of measurements in acoustics, physics and electronics.\nWhile originally only used for power and intensity ratios, it has come to be used\nmore generally in engineering. The decibel is widely used as a measure of the\nloudness of sound. It is a \"dimensionless unit\" like percent. Decibels are useful\nbecause they allow even very large or small ratios to be represented with a\nconveniently small number. This is achieved by using a\nIdB =10log10( I\nI0\n)\nPdB =10log10( P\nP0\n)\nlogarithm.\nIntensity is I and pressure is denoted by P.\nb. (3 points)\ni. Jet engine - 130 dB @ 30 m\nii. Car - motorcycle accelerating @ 5m = 110 dB\niii. Whale - Blue Whale humming at 1m = 180 dB\niv. Underwater Seismic Activity - seafloor volcanic eruption = 255 unerwater\ndB @ 1m.\nv. Rock concert - average is about 100 dB\nvi. Ships propeller - Supertanker = ~127 dB in air and 190 dB in water\nvii. Dolphin - 208 dB in water @ 6 m.\nc. (3 points)\ni. 10log10(A/B) = 10*(log10(A) - log10(B)) = log10(A10) - log10(B10)\nii. 10log10(A+B) = log10((A+B)10)\niii. 10log10(AB) = B*10* log10(A)\nd. (2 points)\ni. 10log10(1) dB = 0 dB\nii. 10log10(10) dB = 10 dB\niii. 10log10(0.5) dB = -3.01 dB\niv. 10log10(4) dB = 6.02 dB\nv. 10log10(16) dB = 12.04 dB\nProblem 2: (10 points)\na. (3 points) A sound wave is a pressure wave traveling at the speed of sound in\nsaltwater at ~1500 m/s and in air at ~343 m/s\nb. (4 points) using saltwater\ni. air = 343 m, saltwater = 1500 m\nii. air = 1.715E-4 m, saltwater = 7.5E-4 m\niii. air = 7.6E-4 m, saltwater = 3.3E-3 m\niv. air = 34.3 Hz, saltwater = 150 Hz\nv. air = 171.5 Hz, saltwater = 1500 Hz\nvi. air = 3.43 Hz, saltwater = 15 Hz\n\n2.011\n3/22/06\nc. (3 points) Higher frequencies attenuate more poorly than lower frequencies in all\nthree mediums, so the lower frequency (i) will travel the furthest or attenuate the\nleast. Sound waves travel fastest in steel, then water, then air.\nProblem 3: (2 points)\na. (2 points) Passive sonar only listens to sounds (receiver), whereas Active sonar\nsends and receives signals to determine distances, shapes etc.\nb. (2 points) Pref = 1Î¼Pa\nc. (2 points) Directivity determines how poorly the signal is attenuated in a certain\ndirection. If the signal is not directed at all, then the signal is attenuated equally in\nall directions, however, if the source is focused in a certain direction then it will\nattenuate much less in that direction and will be more intense in the direction it is\nintended. Directivity is used to determine if a receiver is within the focus\ndirection or inside a null node or side band signal etc, and can help determine the\nsignal strength.\nd. (2 points) DIline array=10log(2L/Î») and DIrectangular array=10log(4ÏLxLy/Î»2) so the line\narray only considers the length, where the rectangular array must consider the\nlength and width, as well as dividing by wavelength squared.\nDIline/Directangle=Î»/2L.\ne. (2 points) The line array on the left has a very large intensity at its center in the\nhorizontal direction; the line array on the left has a large intensity along its\nvertical centerline. John Leonard pointed out that the longer an array is the\nnarrower its beam is concentrated near its center.\nProblem 4: (10 points)\na. (5 points) Sound waves tend to bend towards regions with low velocities. In the\nupper mixed layer the sound tends to move towards the surface. In the upper\nlayer the sound waves cannot travel more than a few kilometers. If it is reflected\nfrom the surface it tends to bend back to the surface as it moves through the\nregion. In the thermocline the sound waves tend to bend toward the region of\nslowest velocity. When a sound is transmitted it is forced out in all directions\n(unless specifically directed towards on direction) as it travels near a higher\nvelocity it is bent back to the lower speed region. In the sound channel the sound\nwaves can travel thousands of kilometers.\nb. (5 points) The sound waves will tend to travel in large sinusoidal waves, not in a\nhorizontal line, because of the nature of the bending of the waves as they move\nthrough different sound speed regions. In general they always travel with some\nsinusoidal propagation.\nProblem 5: (10 points)\n(\n) p(r,t) = A\nr cos(kr \"#t) = Re A\nr e\"i(kr\"#t)\n$ % &\n' ( )\nI(r,\",#) = 1\n$c\nT\np2(r,\nT\n%\n\",#,t)dt\n&\n' (\n)\n* +\na.\n4 points\n\n2.011\n3/22/06\nDefinition of RMS: frms =\nT1 \"T2\nf (t)\n[\n]\n2dt\nT1\nT2\n#\nprmsT1=0 =\nT\np2(r,\",#,t)dt\nT\n$\nI(r,\",#) = 1\n$c prms\nb.

      "content": "2.011 Take home exam; Spring 2006\nOut: Friday May 5th\nDue: Friday May 12th; by 5pm\nHand into TA or electronically via email.\nMake sure your name is on all submissions!\nProblem 1:\nYou are hired by a consortium of oceanographic agencies to investigate the Antarctic Circumpolar\nCurrent (ACC). From your basic knowledge of the ocean you know very little about the ACC, but\nyou do remember hearing once that it is a region of very high wind and waves and that the current\ntravels all the way around the continent of Antarctica.\na) Before you can start your project you need to do a little background research. In\napproximately one page, describe the ACC and its significance on global ocean circulation and\nweather, and transport of things like nutrients, fish, phytoplankton, etc. What are the general\nweather and water column properties in the current (e.g. waves, wind, temperatures, salinity,\ncurrent velocities...)? What is the predominant force driving this current? Web pages are\nacceptable sources - but cite your sources!\nb) From your research you may have read that the majority of water in the ACC passes through\nDrake's passage at the southern tip of South America. You can roughly model this passage as a\nrectangular channel (see sketch below) and a current flowing to the east (positive x-direction,\nclockwise around Antarctica). You can assume that this current does not vary with depth down\nto about half of the channel depth; below this you can assume there is no flow. Neglect\nCoriolis force in parts b and c only and neglect wind generated waves for parts b-d.\nUsing the basic governing equations for fluids and relevant boundary conditions, determine\nthe velocity profile across the channel from North to South (positive y-direction is considered\nto point northward, positive z-direction is take up from the free surface).\nYou can assume that this is steady, fully-developed flow (i.e. it's been flowing through the\nchannel for a long time and the profile hasn't changed in time). You can assume that the walls\nare vertical and that the channel can be considered infinite in length. To start consider only a\nsimple section looking down on the channel, and neglect the effect of depth on the flow.\nAssume that the pressure gradient in x-direction, along the channel, is constant.\nSouth\nAmerica\ny\nDrake's Passage\n(top view)\nN\nFLOW\nx\nW\nE\nS\nAntarctica\nHint: flow across this channel (N-S) is symmetric!\n\nc) Using the profile from part b, determine an approximate volume flow rate through the channel\nin terms of the constant pressure gradient in the x-direction. You can assume a specific\nchannel depth taken from literature compared with the channel's width, or leave this in terms\nof general variables. Assume, still, that the flow does not vary with depth down to half the\nchannel depth.\nd) The ACC loops around Antarctica and is driven primarily by wind. This wind creates an\nEkman Layer and results in Ekman pumping. Locally, the continent can be loosely modeled as\na straight shoreline with a vertical wall dropping off to the deep ocean. Assuming the wind is a\nwesterly wind (blowing out of the west to the east). Determine the direction of Ekman\nPumping and calculate the Ekman Mass transport in the x and y directions for a wind velocity\nU10 = 2 m/s. Use a reasonable estimate for Cd ~ 0.003.\nProblem 2:\nIn at least two (2) typed pages (~double spaced, 12point, 1in margins) detail your contributions to\nthe 2.011 Mega SeaPerch Vehicle. Detailed specifications and or photos can be added, but text\nshould be equivalent of about 2 pages.\n- This discussion can include both your part in the building of the basic ROV and your\nspecific \"advanced\" instrument.\n- Describe what your goal was (e.g. to build an instrument to measure x, why is x important\nin the ocean?); your approach to the problem (e.g. modified existing sensor or built from\nscratch using x, y, z parts; include basic schematics, or sketches, where appropriate); and\nany recommendations for future modifications/improvements.\n- Discuss calibration issues where necessary or problems that you anticipate might arise in\ntesting.\n- Discuss what you learned in the process of building your apparatus.\nJust for fun:\nName our ROV.\nThe END."

      "content": "MIT Ocean Engineering Teaching Lab\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\nA well equipped lab, such as the Ocean Engineering Teaching Laboratory (OETL), is a\nwonderful resource in which you can do amazing things with your engineering\nknowledge. Unfortunately, your time in the lab will be limited, so it is imperative that\nyou come to the lab awake, prepared, and ready to work. Once in the lab you should work\nin an organized and efficient fashion. The following simple rules will help you to develop\ngood lab skills:\n1. Ready any assigned material before you come to the lab.\n2. Take the time to think about the purposes and procedures of the lab before diving\ninto the hardware.\n3. Plan and organize your work before you start, don't forget to discuss this plan\nwith your lab partner(s) if you have any.\n4. Organize your work space, you can't do good work if you' re uncomfortable.\n5. Take thorough notes and write them in your lab notebook while you work, not\nafter you work.\n6. Analyze your data as soon as possible after the lab, this will reduce the risk of\nforgetting any important points about the lab that you may have forgotten to write\ndown during the lab.\n\nIf you work in groups, then the group members are responsible for the fair division of\nlabor in carrying out the lab activities. Each person within a group must keep his/her own\nlab notebook and common data and other information must appear in each group\nmember's lab notebook. Each member of the group must do his/her own data analysis\nand write it up in his/her own lab notebook.\n\nTools and test equipment will be kept in common storage areas. You will get the\nequipment that you need at the start of the lab and return it to the proper storage areas at\nthe end of the lab. Setups that must remain intact for more than one lab session may be\nleft on the bench but they must be labeled with your name(s) and dated. If possible, such\nsetups should be placed on the shelves above the workbenches to leave the workbench\nspaces clear for other students to use. There will be a set of drawers and shelves assigned\nto you and /or your class for long-term storage of project-specific equipment and parts.\n\nWe will go to the proper use of each tool and test instrument as it is needed for the labs.\nYou will not be allowed to use a tool or test instrument unless you have been properly\ntrained in its use. All equipment must be properly cared for and put away after\nAfter each laboratory session. If any piece of equipment breaks notify the lab manager\nimmediately so it can be fixed or replaced. Other students will be using this equipment\nduring non-course hours. Notify the lab manager immediately if any equipment is left in\na disorganized or dysfunctional state by non-course students.\n\nYou can make your own directory on any of the lab's computers. Just place that directory\nin the \"My Documents\" folder of the computer you are working on. Alternatively, if you\n\nare a member of a course then you can put group work in the course's directory, for\nexample, \"My Documents\\2.017\".You will be given the computer login codes on the first\nday of the class. All your data, text and graphics should be kept organized in these\ndirectories. It is recommended that your directory be kept well-organized and backed-up\nperiodically onto floppy disks, zip disks, or CDROMs that we will provided as needed.\nEach of our lab's PC's is connected to the campus network and the Internet so you can\nalso upload your data to your campus account and do your analyses outside of the lab.\nThe Internet and World Wide Web are great tools for research and while you are in the\nlab they should be used such. CHATTING WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR OTHER NON-\nLAB RELATED INTERNET ACTIVITIES WILL NOT BE TOLERATED IN THE\nLAB!\n\nWhen you enter the lab place your coat, backpack and other personal items under a lab\nbench or chair, or otherwise out of the way. Do not dump your stuff on a workbench that\nyou or your fellow students will be using, or in the aisles. The only things you should\ntake to the workbench are your notebook, calculator and lab-related books. You should\ntake ALL your personal belongings with you at the end of the lab session. We are not\nresponsible for personal items left in the lab, they may be stolen and they definitely will\nbe thrown away when we periodically clean the lab. The storage space assigned to the\nclass is for class-specific items, not personal belongings. Bicycles are not allowed in the\nlab, they should be chained to the bicycle racks, outside, near the lab. Students may not\nwear roller blades in the lab or in the building."

      "content": "2.011 Ocean Systems Design Challenge\nSpring 2006\nIntroduction:\nYou have been hired by an oceanographic research institute to find, map and collect data\n(especially temperature) from a field of hydrothermal vents in the Atlantic. There are\nmany types of hydrothermal vents but generally they are formed by rifts in the earth's\ncrust near the bottom of the ocean. Water from a chamber under the sea floor is heated by\nthe molten earth below and rises to the surface, due to buoyancy. The water temperature\nis very hot (400o-750oC), but these vents still serve as a home to millions of\nmicroorganisms.\nThis year's 2.011 challenge will focus on designing and building an ROV outfitted with\nthe necessary instrumentation to map and investigate a simulated vent field in a pool or\ntank. This project will give students a chance to collect data about the field from the\nsensors they build themselves. Points will be awarded for robustness, sensitivity,\nversatility of the vehicle, operability, and how useful the information will be for future\nscientific discovery.\nAfter completing the pool trials, we will venture to the Charles River or Boston Harbor to\n\"field test\" our ROV.\nStep 1: Planning your vehicle\nBreak out in small groups and brainstorm. Consider which instruments are crucial for the\nmission, and which instruments you would like to have on the vehicle (wish list). Also\nconsider, based on your choice of instruments, what the performance characteristics for\nyour vehicle need to be (e.g. maneuvering, forward/reverse swimming, up/down diving,\netc.), and what you might be interested in working on for this project.\nCourtesy of NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory's Vents Program. Used with permission.\nPlease see: http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/multimedia.html\n\nStep 2: Designing the Vehicle\nCollectively determine a preliminary instrumentation proposal, while keeping in mind the\nmissions it will be involved in.\nRegroup and share the information obtained from the brainstorming exercise. Consider\neach proposed instrument to assess its relevance to the project, estimated cost, usefulness,\nfeasibility (can it be completed in the time allotted, do we have/can we quickly learn the\nskills needed to build it), and overall student interest (is one person particularly\nexcited/against about building a certain instrument?).\nNext consider the actual vehicle design and configuration. Is the prototype frame\nsufficiently large and well designed for our needs? Are there enough places to mount\nequipment? Where should the motors be placed? Are there hydrodynamic/stability issues\nto consider? Where will the electronics go? What else should be considered? If the ROV\nis designed for the diving well of the MIT pool (about 16-20ft? deep), will it be limited in\nthe \"real-world\".\nStep 3: Build the ROV platform and test\nAfter the design phase, the ROV will be built and tested. There are three main parts, the\nstructure, the motors (the required motors and some extras, just in case), and the control\nbox. Once the components are built we will assemble the vehicle and test the ROV\nplatform for seaworthiness and controllability. At this step we can also review how well\nour design/ideas worked.\nStep 4: Build and test sensors\nOnce the ROV is built, sensor groups will be formed to design, and build the\ninstrumentation. Each group will design, build and test an instrument of their choosing.\nThe instruments will give students the opportunity to assess a need, design a solution,\nbuild a prototype, test, and report on the outcome. Instruments will be developed to\nobtain data for the challenge and open water dives. This step will take up most of the\nterm.\nStep 5: Face the 2.011 Challenge\nThe real test of the equipment will be acquiring data from the challenge and determining\nwhether it is accurate and useful. And further \"field exploration\" will be performed."

This is\nsimilar to the calculation of Î¶ of the surface layer.\n- Calculate the slope of the upper pressure surface relative to the lower.\n- Calculate the geostrophic current at the upper surface relative to the\ncurrent at the lower.

Nevertheless, it is important to review the\nlimitations of the technique.\n1. Hydrographic data can be used to calculate only the current\nrelative to a current at another level.\n2. The assumption of a level of no motion may be suitable in the\ndeep ocean, but it is usually not a useful assumption when the\nwater is shallow such as over the continental shelf.\n3. Geostrophic currents cannot be calculated from hydrographic\nstations that are close together. Stations must be tens of\nkilometers apart.\n\nLimitations of the Geostrophic\nEquations\n-\nThe geostrophic balance is not perfect.\n-\nIf it were, the flow in the ocean would never change because the\nbalance ignores any acceleration of the flow.\n-\nImportant limitations of the geostrophic assumption are:\n1. Geostrophic currents cannot evolve with time because the balance\nignores acceleration of the flow. Acceleration dominates if the\nhorizontal dimensions are less than roughly 50 km and times are less\nthan a few days. Acceleration is negligible, but not zero, over longer\ntimes and distances.\n2. The geostrophic balance does not apply within about 2* of the equator\nwhere the Coriolis force goes to zero because sinÏ â 0.\n3.

The right side of the wall is open to the air with atmospheric pressure acting\nover the height of the wall. Under this setup we must account for the atmospheric\npressure on both sides of the wall. The elemental force in the x-direction at some depth z\nbelow the free surface is formulated on the left and right sides of the wall to determine\nthe total force acting on the wall:\n(\nLeft:\ndFx1 = (P + Ï h\ng\n- z)) dz\nw\na\nRight:\ndFx2 = -\ndz\nw\nP a\nTotal force:\ndF = dFx1 + dF =\ndz\nw\nP\n+ Ï h\ng\n-\ndz\nw\nz\n-\ndz\nw\nP\n(\n)\nx\nx2\na\na\nThe two underlined terms cancel and we are left only with the effect due to the presence\nof the water.

If absorption and spreading losses are\ncomparable in magnitude, you have three options:\n- In a \"back-of-the-envelope\" sonar design, one can obtain an initial\nestimate for the range by first ignoring absorption, then plugging in\nnumbers with absorption until you get an answer that is \"close\nenough\".\n- For a more systematic procedure, one can do Newton-Raphson\niteration (either by hand or with a little computer program), using\nthe range without absorption as the initial guess.\n- Another good strategy (and a good way to check your results) is to\nmake a plot of TL vs. range with a computer program (e.g., Matlab).\nNewton-Raphson method: (Numerical recipes in C, page 362)\nf(xi)\nxi+1 = xi -f â²(xi)\nTo solve for range given TL, we have:\nf(xi) = TL -20 log xi -10-3Î±xi\nf â²(xi) = -20 -10-3Î±\nr\nTL =\nx0 =\ni\nxi\n20 log xi\n0.001Î±xi\nf(xi)\nf â²(xi)\nf(xi)/f â²(xi) xi+1 = xi -f(xi)\nf â²(xi)\n\nÎ» =\nÎ± =\nÎ±\nPROPAGATION PART I: SPREADING AND ABSORPTION\nExample 1: whale tracking\nL = 2 km\nPassive sonar equation:\nGiven:\n- f0 = 250 Hz\n- DT = 15 dB\n- P = 1 Watt (omni)\n- NL = 70 dB\n- line array: L = 2 km\nQuestion: How far away can we hear the whale?\nTL =\n=\nDI =\nSL =\nTL = 20 log r + Î± âr â10-3 =\nRt = 8680 =\nr =\n(w/o absorption)\nr =\n(with absorption)\n\nÎ±\nPROPAGATION PART I: SPREADING AND ABSORPTION\nTL vs range for alpha=0.003 dB/km, f=250 Hz\nTL (dB)\nrange (m)\nFigure 1: TL vs. range for whale tracking example (f=250 Hz, Î± = 0.003 dB/km).\nf(xi) = TL -20 log xi -10-3Î±xi =\nf â²(xi) = -20 -10-3Î± =\nr\nTL\n=\ni\nxi\n20 log xi\n500,000 114\n459,500 13.2\n445,000 112.96\n=\n0.001Î±xi\nf(xi)\nf â²(xi)\n1.5\n-1.5\n-3.7 Ã 10-5\n1.38\n-0.6\n-4.05 Ã 10-5\n1.34\n-0.3\nx0 =\nf(xi)/f â²(xi) xi+1 = xi -f(xi)\nf â²(xi)\n\nÎ» =\nÎ± =\nÎ±\nPROPAGATION PART I: SPREADING AND ABSORPTION\nL = 1 m\nExample 2: dolphin tracking\nPassive sonar equation:\nGiven:\n- f0 = 125 kHz\n- DT = 15 dB\n- SL 220 dB re 1 Î¼ Pa at 1 meter\n- NL = 70 dB\n- line array: L = 1 m\nQuestion: How far away can we hear (detect) the dolphin?\nTL =\n=\nDI =\nTL = 20 log r + Î± âr â10-3 =\nRt = 8680 =\nr =\n(w/o absorption)\nr =\n(with absorption)\nr =\n(w/o spreading)\nf(xi) = TL -20 log xi -10-3Î±xi =\n\nÎ±\nPROPAGATION PART I: SPREADING AND ABSORPTION\nTL vs range for alpha=30 dB/km, f=125 kHz\nTL (dB)\nrange (m)\nFigure 2: TL vs. range for dolphin tracking example (f=125 kHz, Î± = 30 dB/km).\nf â²(xi) = -20 -10-3Î± =\nr\nTL\n=\ni\nxi\n20 log xi\n69.6\n69.35\n=\n0.001Î±xi\nf(xi)\n-67\n90.9\n-3.5\n88.05\n-0.4\nf â²(xi)\n-0.034\n-0.037\n-0.368\nx0 =\nf(xi)/f â²(xi) xi+1 = xi -f(xi)\nf â²(xi)\n10.9\n\nPROPAGATION PART II: REFRACTION\nPropagation Part II: refraction\nIn general, the sound speed c is determined by a complex relationship\nbetween salinity, temperature, and pressure:\nc = f(S, T, D)\nMedwin's formula is a useful approximation for c in seawater:\nc = 1449.2 + 4.6T -0.055T 2 + 0.00029T 3\n+(1.34 -0.010T)(S -35) + 0.016D\nwhere S is the salinity in parts per thousand (ppt), T is the temperature in\ndegrees Celsius, and D is the depth in meters.
