Beginning in colonial America and ending in the twenty-first century, we will consider how the visual and material world of \"nature\" has been reshaped by industrial practices, ideologies, and institutions, with a particular emphasis on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Through our lectures and readings we will visit a variety of landscapes--from small farms to suburbs, from Walden Pond to Yosemite National Park--in an effort to uncover not only the ways that technologies have shaped the landscapes around us, but also the ways that the natural world has resisted and redirected technological change. Topics include land-use patterns; the changing shape of cities and farms; the redesign of water systems; the construction of roads, dams, bridges, irrigation systems; the creation of national parks; ideas about wilderness; aesthetic responses to industrialization; and the role of nature in a \"technological world.\"\n\nGeneral Course Requirements\n\nStudents are expected to attend all sessions and to be active participants in class discussion. More than two (2) unexcused absences will have an adverse effect on your grade. As this is a Communication-Intensive (CI) course, students will be assessed on both oral and written work: students will be required to lead class discussion at least once during the semester, to participate actively in each class discussion, to write frequent 1-2 page informal reading response papers, to write three (3) formal papers of increasing length, and to submit a draft and revision of the final research paper.\n\nRequired Reading and Writing\n\nThe following books are required for the course. Additional articles and book excerpts will also be assigned and distributed.\n\nBasso, Keith.\nWisdom Sits in Places\n. Albuquerque, NM: University of New Mexico Press, 1996.

Response papers will be graded. Please email me your response papers no later than midnight the night before our discussion so that I can circulate them to the rest of the class. Response papers have two purposes: to help you generate ideas and questions about the week's topic, and to serve as a starting point for our discussion.\n\nThere are three (3) formal writing assignments in this class, as well as a revision of your final paper. I will distribute specific assignment descriptions for each paper as the course gets underway. Today is not too early to start thinking about your final paper, which can explore one of the course topics or a subject related to your other coursework or interests. I will help you design your topics and identify primary and secondary sources, and I will provide more specific research guidelines as you proceed.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nStudents are expected to adhere to principles of academic honesty in their work. All written work must be a student's own original work. (Collaboration on essay assignments is not permitted.) Any and all references to other sources within your own paper must be properly documented according to the guidelines in the\nChicago Manual of Style\n.

Its fortune is inexorably linked to that of New York City, and all of New York\nState. How did the Hudson move from being a tool of commerce and industry into a force\nthat drove against big business's use and exploitation of it?\nThis paper focuses on the twentieth century conflicts between commercial and individual\nand environmental use of New York's Hudson river. Commercial use of the Hudson from\ncompanies like General Electric and Consolidated Edison started to become an environmental\nproblem in the second quarter of the twentieth century1, though awareness only really began\nin the 1960s, with groups like Scenic Hudson starting to organize responses in the 1970s.\nReactions in the public view and the media increased dramatically from 1970s through the\n1990s, and has continued into the twenty-first century.\nHow did what was once a convenient resource to be exploited transform into a billions of\ndollars of costs to corporate America?\nIt's stunning to look at how most of the damage (and recovery!) of the Hudson River\nwatershed has happened within the the last century. It is only in the last century that\nmankind has gained to ability to so seriously damage the environment, and far less recently\n1G.E. received a permit for discharge of PCBs into the Hudson as early as 1930. This suggests that the\ndumping may have begun substantially earlier. . . [Lewis], p. 271.\n\nCourtesy of U.S. Geological Survey.\nFigure 1: The Hudson River watershed, and eastern New York. The Hudson runs up the\neastern side of the state from its mouth at New York City up through Hudson, New York,\nAlbany, Troy, and up to Hudson Falls and Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondack\nMountains.\n\nthat we have become aware of our ability to do so, and the ramifications of that activity.\nThere has been a sea change in our view of the Hudson; we treat environmental concerns\nseriously and with real resources, where they were previously ignored and marginalized.\nWhile we cannot go back in time and prevent historical wrongs of PCB dumping, and\nsometimes we cannot pay for immensely costly cleanups, the dumping that led to that\npollution could never be considered acceptable today.2\nThe balance of power between those who dictates the use of our natural resources and\nthose who consume them has changed radically over time, as well. There has always been\na tension between government and and corporate, or even a three-way tension between\nregulatory interests, big-business interests, and individual interests.3 But it is only in the\nlate twentieth century that the power of the individual has reached the point of being effective\nagainst those other forces.\nEnvironmentalism has lead to a dramatic change in the way the Hudson is treated. It\nhas become a cultural and social phenomenon, and an entire movement. School children\nwho grow up in the Hudson River watershed are taught about the environmental movement,\nand might even take field trips on sloops like the Clearwater.4 It has led to annual festivals\ncelebrating the native fish (e.g. Hudson River shad) and the culture of the Hudson.\nClearwater is a organized movement of Hudson River activists started in the late 1960s\nby folk singer Pete Seeger (\"Until people start to love their river, it's going to be a sewer.\")\nwith an emphasis on education and outreach. Clearwater's advocacy revolves around an\n18th century Dutch -styled sailing sloop, Clearwater, which sails up and down the Hudson,\n2Which is not to say that dumping does not happen or does not continue. But when it happens it happens\nunder-the-table and illicitly, not legitimately or as something societally acceptable. [Harr, Zaillian].\n3[Pinchot, Muir]\n4[Clearwater]\n\nand accomodates thousands of schoolchildren on field trips and as an education laboratory.5\nClearwater is both an example of the changes in that balance of power, as well as instrumental\nin causing those changes: without popular support, there would never have been a Clearwater\nmovement, but without the success cleaning up the Hudson, Clearwater would not have\nstayed a viable and effective advocacy and teaching group.\nThe Hudson has been the victim of several major incidents of pollution, and concomitant\nreactions from society.\nProbably the two best-known are General Electric's dumping of\nPCBs, and Con Edison's Storm King power generation facility, but there are scores of small-\nscale incidents that contributed.6\nIn the case of G.E., it took decades for the balance of power to shift away from corporate\ninterests towards a middle ground between environmentalists and large companies. What\nbegan with awareness in the 1960s transformed into a war, with battles fought in the sphere\nof public awareness, within the media, within the court system, where it continues today,\nwith a surfeit of foot-dragging. These battles are also not without economic significance. It\nis a notable achievement that ordinary citizens have been able to compel the investment of\nbillions of dollars in cleanups and transformations.\n\"At Tarrytown, residents knew each day what color General Motors was painting\nits production of trucks by the color of the Hudson. By 1960 Manhattan was\npumping 165 million gallons of raw sewage a day into the river.\"7\n5Growing up and going to school near the Hudson, I had several opportunities to visit and ride the\nClearwater. It was quite educational and a lot of fun. . . I have avoided the temptation in this paper to\ncapitalize too much on personal experience, outside this footnote. I grew up in an apartment building on\na lot adjacent to the north border of Yonkers, NY, adjoining Hastings-On-Hudson, NY. From my bedroom\nand our living room, you could look out on the river view of the Hudson.\nCuriously, Hastings-On-Hudson, the nearby village, was also the site of one of the more notorious Hudson\nriver polluters, the Anaconda Company. Anaconda manufactured wire and cable and polluted both the rier\nand their dockside property with heavy metals, solvents, PCBs, and asbestos for thirty years from the 1950s\nto the 1970s. The plant cost to clean up the Hastings facilities was in the tens of millions of dollars; a lot of\nmoney, but peanuts compared to the major cleanups for G.E. I discuss later. [Riverkeepers]\n6[Riverkeepers], pp. 17-31\n7[Lewis], p. 262.\n\nTom Lehrer's popular 1965 song \"Pollution\" characterized the specific case of Troy, NY\n(and thus the Hudson)8:\nIf you visit American city,\nYou will find it very pretty.\nJust two things of which you must beware:\nDon't drink the water and don't breathe the air!\nPollution, pollution!\nThey got smog and sewage and mud.\nTurn on your tap\nAnd get hot and cold running crud!\n...\nLots of things there that you can drink,\nBut stay away from the kitchen sink!\nThe breakfast garbage they throw out in Troy\nThey drink at lunch in Perth Amboy.\nThe Hudson river environmental movement has been very closely tied to folk music, and\nClearwater founder Pete Seeger successfully managed to tie the two together in a popular\nway. In the listeners of his music, Seeger found a group of people who cared about the\nenvironment and a force that could be harvested as a wellspring of popular support for the\nriver. Songs like Rick Nestler's The River That Flows Both Ways9 inspired community and\ncaring about the river, as well as education. The Hudson does indeed \"flow both ways\"; as\nan estuary--an aquatic environment where ocean saltwater mixes with river freshwater, and\ntidal forces and ocean currents ply with downstream river flow--the Hudson is home to a\nfairly rare environment for river flora and fauna. Nestler's song helped to place that specific\nknowledge in the minds hundreds of thousands. More generally, the popular awareness of the\nriver played a huge role in public perception and getting the political will to make progress\nin its cleaning.\n8[Lehrer]\n9[Nestler]\n\nPolychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are excellent insulators used in transformers and other\nelectrical equipment dating from the early twentieth century. Unfortunately, they are also\ntoxic if ingested, linked to birth defects, developmental disorders, as well as cancer, and\nare molecularly similar to DDT.10 Awareness of PCBs in the Hudson as an environmental\nproblem began in the 1975, and slowly developed. General Electric had been dumping PCBs\ninto the Hudson River near Fort Edward for over forty years, under a legal permit from the\nfederal government. In 1973, the Niagara Mohawk Power Company removed a small obsolete\ndam near Fort Edward, stirring up hundreds of tons of PCBs that lay in the sediment beneath\nit. In 1974, the EPA found bass containing 350 ppm of PCBs in the Hudson, 70 times the\n1974 legal limit of 5 ppm.11\nThe discovery of PCBs in Hudson River fish, especially in striped bass, was not well-\nunderstood at first.\nTests in 1975 found much lower levels, between 4 and 11 ppm, in\nHudson River striped bass. Concern was raised about whether 5 ppm was even a reasonable\nlimit, and scientists studying the issue almost seemed to laugh it off, while at the same level\nquestioning the then limits: \"My gut-level reaction is that I would not want to eat any fish\nwith a concentration over 1 ppm, and I think the most desirable goal would be to get rid of\nall PCBs. As a matter of fact, all of us here love to eat Pacific salmon in the summer, so\nwe deliberately avoid analyzing it,\" said Dr. Robert Risebrough of UCB.12 As of 2008, the\nEPA limits PCBs to 0.0005 ppm in drinking water, and the FDA limits PCBs to between\n0.2 and 2.0 ppm in fish.13\nThe results of the battle over G.E.'s PCB dumping are ambiguous--neither G.E. nor\nthe environmentalists won all the battles, and there's been a lot of back and forth between,\n10[NYT0875]\n11[NYT0376b]\n12[NYT0376a]\n13[CDC]\n\nand no one side prevailed absolutely. New York State ordered G.E. to stop the continuing\nto discharge PCBs, but G.E. resisted, threatening economic sanctions, and Governor Hugh\nCarey overrode the Environmental dept. Federal Environmental Protection Agency Super-\nfund legislation was passed in 1980, and Fort Edward was added to the Superfund list in\n1984, nine years awareness of the problem arose. G.E. embarked on a lobbying strategy to\navoid paying, with successive legislation passed to delay the cleanup14, along with significant\nPR efforts (General Electric owned the National Broadcasting Company, NBC, giving them\nquite an advantage in NBC's TV coverage of these issues). As Eliot Spitzer said in 2000\n(when he was New York State Attorney General and suing G.E. on behalf of New York\nState), \"What begins to happen is the offending party can say, 'You've survived this long.\nWhy bother?' They become beneficiaries of their own delay.\"15\nMajor losers all around were the small commercial fishermen, who made their livelyhood\nfishing striped bass (\"stripers\") and shad from the Hudson. Regulations prohibiting the sale\nof 19 species of fish from the Hudson instituted in 1976 dramatically affected the livelyhoods\nof these fisherman, who had to turn to other locations, other varieties (those less prone\nto bottom-feeding, where the PCB-laden sediment collects), or to give up fishing entirely.\nThese problems were not limited to the Hudson, either. The striped bass are migratory fish,\nwho spawn in the Hudson and then travel out into the Atlantic, and return to the Hudson\nto spawn. Fisherman throughout the Atlantic Fishery were affected.16\nG.E. successfully delayed the EPA's final order for 16 years, until they were finally ordered\nto dredge 3 million cubic yards of sediment in 2000. But G.E. challenged the SuperFund\nlaw in federal court, at first winning in 2004, but then settling. Since then, G.E. has been\n14G.E.'s Jack Welch, now retired as CEO, was at the time a newly-minted Vice President who was tasked\nwith dealing with the Hudson. Welch has been much-lauded in business circles, and praised as an excellent\nmanager. At the same time, he's been the driving force behind G.E.'s postponement tactics. [Cassidy]\n15[Kolbert]\n16[NYT0376b]\n\ngearing up to begin the cleanup, and while preparations have begun, dredging will not begin\nprior to 2009, \"at the earliest.\"17 The cleanup is estimated to cost three-quarters of a billion\ndollars (in 2007 dollars).\nG.E. has managed to delay their cleanup by over 34 years. Massive awareness of the PCB\nproblem resulted from this saga, but G.E. still managed to avoid committing real dollars\nand effort to the problem, and has successfully waged a very significant delaying action. At\nthis point it looks as though they will be required to procede with the cleanup, but it has\nnot happened yet.\nConsolidated Edison (colloqially, \"Con Ed\") is another example of big business and river\nuse. As New York State's primary electrical utility, Con Ed was one of many users of the\nHudson, and also one of the major disrupters of its ecosystem. In the early 1960s, Con\nEdison completed the Indian Point nuclear power plant near Peekskill, New York. That\nplant used massive quantities of Hudson River water as coolant, sucking in thousands of\nfish per hour. The used coolant raised the temperature of the river significantly enough to\ndisrupt the aquatic life.18\nThe mastermind behind Con Ed's Indian Point project, Con Ed's vice president for power\nplant construction, Mowton Le Compte Waring, planned to continue to exploit the river with\nhis next project in 1963: the Storm King Mountain reservoir at Cornwall, NY just north of\nWest Point. Storm King would pump water into an 8 billion gallon reservoir at the top of\nthe mountain during low demand periods, and generate hydroelectric power from that water\nduring daytime demand periods.\n17[NYT0507]\n18[Lewis], p. 263\n\nWaring's Storm King project aroused a small\nbut vocal movement in opposition, primarily not\nbecause of its environmental effects, but because\nof its potential to disrupt the visual and natural\nhistorical environment (\"the view\"). Mocking\nCon Ed's environmentally-unfriendly \"Dig We\nMust\" motto, the movement kicked offwith an\narmada of 50 yachts bearing the sign \"Dig You\nMust Not\" in September, 1964.19\nThis movement, \"Scenic Hudson,\" included\nboth naturalists and \"wealthy Manhattanites\"\nwith\nweekend\nhouses\noverlooking\nthe\nsite.\nFigure 2:\nRobert Boyle's iconic photo-\nScenic Hudson applied its PR machine and pro-\ngraph of dead striped bass from Con Ed's\nduced a flood of newspaper and magazine arti-\ndump at Indian Point [Boyle].\ncles pitting itself as a small David battling Con\nEd's Goliath; Hudson River advocate John Cronin characterized the River as becoming a\nnational \"cause c el`ebre\"20 from their work. In 1965, after the Federal Power Commission ap-\nproved the Storm King Project, Scenic Hudson sued in federal appeals court and stunningly,\nthey won--it was the first time an environmental group had won a case of this sort.\nThe battles over this landmark decision continued over the next fifteen years, with\nCongress adding additional regulation in in 1969 and 1970, and additional federal appeals\ncourt cases in 1973. In December of 1980, Scenic Hudson and Con Ed settled; Con Ed not\nonly abandoned the Storm King project, but also agreed to deploy measures at Indian Point\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPhoto of a man kneeling by a large pile of dead fish.\nSee: Boyle, Robert.

It showed that large corporate polluters could be fought in court and battles\ncould be one, and transformed the environmental legal landscape.\nAfter (and during) the Storm King saga, there were significant changes to the regulatory\nlandscape. In 1972, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (aka the \"Clean Water Act\")\nwas passed to \"restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the\nNation's waters.\"22 The Clean Water Act built a permitting system for industrial pollution,\nand granted the federal government substantial ability to regulate water pollution. Today's\nClean Water Act even references the Hudson specifically (§1266), with explicit specifications\nfor dealing with PCBs.\nIn 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation\nand Liability Act (CERCLA), colloquially known as \"Superfund.\" Superfund, like the Clean\nWater Act, was a direct response to environmental nightmares found during the 1970s.23\nSuperfund levied taxes the industrial companies and uses those taxes to collect hundreds of\nmillions of dollars to clean up hazardous waste sites.\nIn the twenty-first century, the Hudson remains an estuarine mixing ground between\nthe forces for environmental purity and the remnants of past corporate indiscretions. The\nHudson today is cleaner than it ever was, you can swim in it, fish in it (and eat that fish!),\nsail on it, live on its banks, and simply revel in its beauty. On the other hand, with G.E.\n21[NYT1280]\n22[FWPA]\n23[CERCLA, epaCERCLA]\n\npoised to begin dredging the Hudson next year, it's quite likely that PCB-laden sediment\nwill be disturbed as it is removed, and the Hudson will see a short-term increase in PCB\nlevels during the process. The environmental movement has made great strides at reducing\ncorporate domination of the river and restoring its utility for recreation and appreciation,\nbut there is still work to be done.\n\nA\nWorks cited\nReferences\n[Lewis]\nLewis, Tom.

      "content": "MIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.\nSTS.036 Technology and Nature in American History\nSpring 2008\n\nSTS.036\nSpring 2008\nPaper #3\n\nDue date:\nApril 29 (draft)\n\nMay 15 (revision)\n\nLength:\n10-12 pages (double-spaced, 12-point font)\n\nValue:\n40% of your final grade\n\nChoosing a topic\nYour final paper for this course will be an original historical research paper on a topic of\nyour own design. You may choose to research one of the course topics in more detail, or\nyou may prefer to strike out on your own and research a topic we have not mentioned in\nclass. In either case, topics should directly engage with the central themes and questions\nof the course.\n\nYou may focus your research on any period from colonial America to the 21st century,\nbut regardless of what time period you are working in, your analysis must be historical.\nA wise person once told me that history is not a time but an attitude. In other words, you\ncan write a history of very recent events as long as your approach is historical: explaining\nhow and why things have changed over time.\n\nAs you begin this project, you will likely have a topic or area of general interest in mind\n(e.g., environmental politics) that you will then refine into a research question (e.g., How\ndid postwar suburbanization affect the emergence of environmentalism in the United\nStates?) Don't worry if you don't have a research question right at the outset. If you\ndon't already know a lot about your topic, you will have to do some initial research and\nreading in order to figure out what your question will be. Once you formulate your\nquestion, then you will be able to gather and analyze your sources in a much more\nfocused manner. (And the answer to your research question will end up being the thesis\nstatement for your paper. More on that later.)\n\nOnce you have identified a general area of interest, you should try to narrow your topic as\nmuch as possible. For example, environmental activism in the late 20th century would be\nmuch too big a topic to address in a paper of this length. A more focused and more\nmanageable version of that broad topic might be this: the role of the Walden Woods\nProject in environmental conservation and education projects in Massachusetts from 1990\nto the present. Note that the latter example is focused on a more specific time and place,\nas well as on a particular institution. A narrow topic will serve you much better in the\nresearch and the writing phases since it will allow you to zero in on a focused body of\nprimary sources and then to deal with those sources very specifically in your paper.\n\nHow to begin your research\nOnce you have arrived at a focused topic, you should begin gathering sources. This\npaper will require you to consult both secondary sources (i.e., books and articles by\nhistorians and other scholars that analyze past events) and primary sources (i.e.,\ndocuments written by historical actors during the time period you are researching). Begin\nwith secondary sources so that you can efficiently figure out what has already been said\nabout your topic and what kinds of questions still remain unanswered. For this\nassignment it would be impossible for you to read all of the secondary sources relevant to\nyour topic, but if you choose wisely and find 4 or 5 of the best secondary sources out\nthere, you will come away with a very good overview of the current scholarship on your\nparticular topic. How will you know which secondary sources are the ones to read? I can\nhelp steer you in the direction of particular historians or particular books that have the\nmost to say on your topic.\n\nThe best places to start your search for secondary sources1:\n\nAmerica: History & Life database (EBSCO)\n\nWorldCat database (OCLC)\n\nOnce you have read and taken notes on your secondary sources, you should begin your\nsearch for primary sources. Types of primary sources include newspaper and magazine\narticles, books and essays, advertisements, letters, personal diaries, Congressional\nreports, legal documents, speeches, songs, maps, photographs, illustrations, and any other\ntext or image created during the period you are researching.\n\nIn general, the more primary sources you have, the richer and more vivid and better your\npaper will be. For the purposes of this assignment, you should have at least 25 primary\nsources. (Keep in mind that many sources might be only a page or two in length!)\nWhere to look for primary sources will be determined by your particular topic. Here are\nsome databases I highly recommend:\n\nNewspapers\nProQuest Historical Database\n\nAmerica's Historical Newspapers (from Boston Public Library)\n\nBrooklyn Daily Eagle <http://eagle.brooklynpubliclibrary.org>\n\nUtah Digital Newspapers <http://dream.lib.utah.edu/digital/unews>\n\nPeriodicals\nReaders Guide Retrospective\n\n1 Note for OCW users: many of these recommended research sources are provided by MIT Libraries only\nto the MIT community.\n\nMaking of America (Cornell) <http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/>\n\nMaking of America (Michigan) <http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moagrp/>\n\nNews, business, legal sources\nLexis-Nexis Academic\n\nLetters, diaries, personal narratives\nAlexander Street Database <http://www.inthefirstperson.com/firp/index.shtml>\n\nEverything\n\nAmerican Memory Project at the Library of Congress\n<http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html>\n\nAs convenient as the magic of keyword searching may be, there is no substitute for\npaging through sources in the MIT Libraries, the Boston Public Library, or other local\nlibraries. In the comfort of the libraries you may stumble across a fascinating document\non the page before or after the page you were initially interested in, or you may discover\nimportant connections between people and places and documents--connections that are\ninvisible to keyword searches.\n\nIf you do not already have a system for organizing your research, I highly recommend\nZotero (www.zotero.org), which is a free database created by the Center for History and\nNew Media at George Mason University.\n\nStages in the process\nThere are many steps leading up to the draft that is due on April 29:\n\n- Statement of topic (and hopefully research question) due March 13\n- Preliminary bibliography of at least 4 secondary sources\n- (Re)formulation of research question\n- Preliminary bibliography of at least 25 primary sources\n- Formulation of thesis statement, introductory paragraph(s), and detailed outline\n\nAlthough there are not formal interim deadlines for these various stages, you should pace\nyourself accordingly and complete your research no later than mid-April so that you can\ncomplete a draft by the end of April and then revise it by mid-May.\n\nI will distribute guidelines for writing a research paper once your research is underway.\nFor now, the important thing is that you choose a topic that genuinely interests you. (If\nyou are having trouble coming up with a topic, please let me know and I can help you\nbrainstorm.)\n\nWithout further ado, let the research and the fun begin!"

To my friend, and surely to many\nothers, technology means something (definitely a material artifact) very late-twentieth-century\nand very digital, like a Dell laptop computer, Internet Explorer, a Motorola cellphone, or the\nubiquitous iPod. To this week's essayists, technology is much more than a material object; it is\nan idea with a history of its own, a political constraint, and a social phenomenon.\nWe often think of technologies as having the power to change and shape our world, but\nLeo Marx's essay underscores the power of technology as an idea. After he traces the\nintellectual history of the concept, Marx concludes that the very abstractness of the word\ntechnology has yielded an unintended consequence for those of us in the late twentieth century:\nas we have turned technology from a concrete noun to an increasingly abstract adjective in our\nso-called \"technological world\" or \"technological society,\" we have given the concept \"a host of\nmetaphysical properties and potencies, thereby making it seem to be a determinate entity, a\ndisembodied autonomous causal agent of social change--of history\" (5). According to Marx,\nthis mysterious power that our language has ascribed to technology has resulted in \"postmodern\npessimism\" (5). It strikes me as somewhat ironic that the optimism of an increasingly powerful\nand all-encompassing definition of technology may have resulted in a profound pessimism.\nHistorians often point out that material technologies have unintended consequences in the\n\nphysical world, but according to Marx's argument, it seems that the unintended consequences are\ncultural or metaphysical as well. I wonder how the nineteenth-century belief in a linear march of\nprogress that celebrated railroads and telegraphs, for example, as agents of economic power\nturned into a late-twentieth-century critique of a far more vague concept of technology as the\nroot of social problems. What kind of pessimism have we ended up with, and where did it come\nfrom?\nLangdon Winner's discussion of the social and political power of technologies--in\nparticular his account of Robert Moses's low-hanging and thus discriminatory overpasses in New\nYork--suggests one reason for pessimism: a sense of individual powerlessness within the\npolitical and social structures established by different technologies (12-13). Winner is careful to\nsay that few technological power structures are the direct result of willful conspiracies against\nparticular social groups (10-11), but his accounts of campus architecture and California tomato\nharvesting present a fairly bleak picture in which individual students and individual agricultural\nworkers cannot possibly hope to overcome the constraints imposed upon them by designers of\nconcrete campus plazas and the mechanical tomato harvester. Given Winner's account, what\nkind of optimism can a single person hope for in a society that seems already politically and\ntechnologically determined?\nDonald MacKenzie's essay offers a partial solution to the pessimism resulting from an\nincreasingly abstract and politicized definition of technology. He reminds us that technologies\ntake on different meanings and have different effects depending on who is using them and why,\nand so we must see technical decisions as choices made in a particular time and place, not\ninevitabilities of some natural evolution of \"technological progress.\" We can use Winner's\nquestion \"Best for whom?\" to understand technological change in a more complicated way. To\n\ntake one example, we can point to the nineteenth-century advent of clock time as a marvelous\ninnovation that allowed railroads to run according to schedule and carry freight and passengers\nthrough space at unheard-of speeds. But a technology that was best for railroad companies and\ntheir clients in the mid-nineteenth-century was hardly best for industrial factory workers in cities\nafter the Civil War. In such places, foremen used the clock to control the pace and rhythms of\nwork on the shop floor, thereby taking away the control workers once had over their own labor.\nMacKenzie's essay suggests that the real significance of technology is not as an abstract concept\nbut rather in the multiple technologies that exist for each social group of users in daily life.\nMacKenzie's users have power in the choices that they make about supercomputers and\nmicrochip density, for example, and thus his view of technology strikes me as more socially\nconstructed than politically determined (and far more optimistic than Winner's). It seems that\nwe can make choices about technology, according to MacKenzie, and that those choices do\nmatter in the long run.\nSo as I think about the various rationales for a kind of technological optimism and\npessimism, I am still left with a big question about the values we attach to the concept of\ntechnology. It is easy to see that technology is more than piles of nuts and bolts and wires, just\nas it is more than an intellectual construct handed down from Enlightenment thought. But it is\nhard to see exactly what it is in terms of human values, ethics, and morality. Historian of\ntechnology Melvin Kranzberg famously said that \"technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it\nneutral.\" What, then, is technology, and how are we to make sense of Kranzberg's paradoxical\nlaw? What might it mean to substitute the word \"humans\" for \"technology\" in Kranzberg's\nsentence? How do we understand our own responsibilities and obligations when we make\ndecisions about new technologies?"

Rather, you will often write your way\nto a central idea or a set of questions that appear toward the end of your response paper,\nnot at the beginning.\n\nThere is no one right way to start your response paper. You can use a relevant personal\nexperience as your starting point, or begin with a particularly compelling or confusing\nquotation from the readings, or start with whatever idea in the readings seemed most\nimportant to you. There is no one right way to structure your paper. During the weeks\nwhen we read more than one author, you may choose to compare and contrast some\naspect of the readings. During other weeks, you may find it more productive to critique a\nsingle author's argument or approach. And you are always free--indeed, encouraged--\nto make connections back to previous readings or lectures. Regardless of how you\norganize your response paper, you should avoid merely summarizing the readings.\nAssume that we have all done the reading and know what the authors think; we are more\ninterested in what you think about the readings. What did you find most interesting, most\nsurprising, most puzzling, most wrong-headed?\n\nHowever you decide to proceed, your response paper should be marked by insight and\nclarity and not by grammatical flaws and typographical errors! Response papers should\nbe 1-2 pages in length, typed, double-spaced, and in 12 point font.\n\nAbove all, ask questions, even if you don't know the answers! Often you need to wrestle\nwith a question for a while--both on paper and in class discussion--before you can come\nup with a good answer. And the most interesting historical questions don't have easy or\nobvious answers anyway. So you should feel comfortable with some intellectual risk-\ntaking here: try out ideas and questions even if you are not sure where exactly you are\nheaded.\n\nBe creative! Remember, writing is thinking, and both are a lot more enjoyable when you\nare playing with ideas that excite you."

This is not meant in any way as\na rigid format that you all have to follow, but rather a general sense of what I was thinking of\nwhen I designed the second paper assignment.\n\nIn the marginal comments I have made a descriptive outline that explains how each sentence\nfunctions in relation to the rest of the paragraph. I also mention a few basic writing strategies\nthat might be helpful.\n\nBetween the late eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries, the federal government\nrationalized the American landscape in a way that facilitated the commodification of nature. In\n1785, Congress passed Thomas Jefferson's proposal for the U.S. Rectangular Land Survey,\nwhich essentially transformed the Western landscape into a checkerboard pattern. Land\nsurveyors went west to divide the land into grids, the basic unit of which was the 160 acres that\nwas considered the average size for a single farm. Jefferson's grid made the process of buying\nand selling land more efficient, and it also turned the land itself into a commodity. As\nenvironmental historian Ted Steinberg describes it, the grid was \"a uniform set of boxes easily\nbought and sold.\"\n1 The grid's primary purpose was one of commodification: transforming the\nworld of nature into the world of economic markets and exchange.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Congress rationalized the western landscape on a far more\nsweeping scale as it enacted legislation that parceled out land to individual citizens, corporations,\nand educational institutions. In 1862, under the Homestead Act, the Pacific Railroad Act, and\nthe Morrill Land Grant Act, the federal government began granting parcels of land--for both use\nand sale--to homesteaders, transcontinental railroad companies, and state institutions of higher\neducation. Both Jefferson's survey grid and the Civil War land grant legislation sought to\npromote economic development and democracy. According to cultural historian Rebecca Solnit,\n\"The grid meant rationality in its regularity and democracy in its equal apportionment of space.\"2\nAlthough the rationality of the grid proved to be an enormous economic benefit (for railroad\ncorporations especially), its democratic principles did not extend to the Native Americans who\nwere violently and abruptly pushed off their lands to make way for settlement and industrial\ndevelopment.\n\n1 Theodore Steinberg, Down to Earth: Nature's Role in American History (New York: Oxford University\nPress, 2002), 60.\n\n2 Rebecca Solnit, River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West (New York:\nPenguin Books, 2003), 195.\nComment [JP1]: Topic sentence that\npresents the overarching idea for the\nparagraph. It also says who did what,\nwhen, and why it was important.\nComment [JP2]: Here are some\nspecific historical details that basically\nexplain how the grid was created and\nwhat it was for. (This part is the \"what.\")\nComment [JP3]: This sentence is\nmore analytical than factual; it explains\nthe significance of the details in the\nprevious 2 sentences. (This part is the\n\"so what?\")\nComment [JP4]: Here is one way to\nintegrate a direct quotation into your own\nprose. (There are other ways, and you\nshould feel free to use a variety of\nmethods.)\nComment [JP5]: In general it is\nalways a good idea to take the last word\nin a paragraph. In other words, don't end\na paragraph with a quote. This sentence\nunderscores the main theme of the\nparagraph.\nComment [JP6]:\nAs much as possible, I try to avoid the\npassive voice (\"to be\" verbs). Instead of\nsaying that \"land was granted,\" I specify\nthat it was the federal government who\nwas making the land grants to various\ngroups. Your writing will be more\nprecise if you always specify who is\ndoing what to whom, and when.\nComment [JP7]: This is another way\nto conclude a paragraph--qualify an\nearlier statement or challenge someone\nelse's assertion. And this sentence leads\ninto what might be the next paragraph on\nNative Americans' experience of mid-19th\ncentury industrialization."

For this assignment I would like you to undertake a similar, although far\nsmaller, mapping project of the landscape of your daily life. Take your reader on a journey\nthrough the physical landscape you experience on a daily basis--your residence, your routes to\nclass, your classrooms and lab spaces, your recreational spaces, your workplace, the stores and\nrestaurants where you are a \"regular,\" your favorite places on and off campus, and any other\nplaces where you can often be found. Assume that you, like Nick Thompson, have \"maps in\n[y]our minds,\" and translate those maps for a reader who is a stranger to your landscape (43).\n\nPay particular attention to how various places in your own landscape have become invested with\nmeaning, whether through place-naming, story-telling, or other creative activity. How have the\nnames you have assigned to places and the stories you have told about those places shaped the\nway you and perhaps others know these places? Also pay attention to how memory and history\nare located in your physical landscape. How have your own experiences and memories become\na part of the places you pass by every day?\n\nAs Basso reminds us, \"our attachments to places, like the ease with which we usually sustain\nthem, are unthinkingly taken for granted\" (xiii). The purpose of this assignment is to consider\ncarefully your own attachments to places and to explain how those attachments have been\nformed and maintained.\n\nThis is a creative writing exercise and you are free to organize your essay however you wish.\nYou are not obligated to quote or refer to Basso's book, but the best papers will resonate with\nsome of the themes and ideas that Basso puts forth.\n\nPapers will be graded on quality of insight and clarity of expression. Strive for elegant prose,\nand make sure that your paper is free of grammatical flaws and typographical errors. (The best\nway to proofread your paper is to read it aloud.)\n\n\"If place-making is a way of constructing the past, a venerable means of doing human\nhistory, it is also a way of constructing social traditions and, in the process, personal and\nsocial identities. We are, in a sense, the place-worlds we imagine\" (Basso, 7)."

      "content": "MIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.036 Technology and Nature in American History\nSpring 2008\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.\n\nSTS.036\nSpring 2008\nPaper #2\n\nLength:\n5-7 pages (double-spaced, 12-point font)\nValue:\n25% of final grade\n\nTopic\nThis assignment is a comparative analytical essay that asks you to compare and contrast the\ncommodification of nature through early-nineteenth-century New England with the\ncommodification of nature in the Great West in the nineteenth century. (Remember that the\n\"Great West\" is a nineteenth-century term that refers to the interior region of the country, all the\nway from the Ohio River west to the Pacific Ocean.) This assignment is designed to give you a\nchance to synthesize the material from the first half of the course into your own original\nargument.\n\nRequirements\nYour paper must be analytical in nature, which means all of the following:\n1. Your paper must begin with a thesis or main idea that is clearly and strongly stated\nsomewhere in your introduction. (\"New England and the Great West experienced the\ncommodification of nature in ways that were both similar and different\" is a not a good\nthesis statement. Your thesis should make a specific claim about how and why the\nprocess of commodifying nature changed over time and place. What factor or factors, in\nyour mind, can best account for how nature was commodified differently in New England\nand the West? Your introduction should explain how the commodification of nature\nlooked different in these two contexts; your thesis should explain why the process was\ndifferent.)\n2. The body of the paper should develop your thesis through a coherent paragraph structure\ndriven by strong topic sentences.\n3. Your assertions must be supported with evidence drawn from the course readings,\nlectures, and discussions.\n4. All references to the course readings--whether direct quotations or paraphrases--must be\ncited according to conventions in the Chicago Manual of Style. You are not required to\nconsult any sources other than the course readings, so most likely you will be footnoting\nonly books1 and possibly articles,2 both of which have a very simple citation format.\n\nFor questions about how, when, and why to cite sources, consult MIT's Academic\n\nIntegrity handbook, available online:\n\nhttp://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/\n\nIf you are not sure whether to cite a source at a particular point in your paper, please ask!\n\nIn general, a safe bet is to err on the side of caution and include the footnote. Too many\n\nfootnotes aren't a problem; too few footnotes can become a very serious problem!\n\n1 William Cronon, Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West (New York: W.W. Norton, 1991), 120.\n2 Leo Marx, \"Technology: The Emergence of a Hazardous Concept,\" Social Research 64, no. 3 (Fall 1997): 965.\n\nHelpful hints\n- You should know exactly what your argument is going to be and how you are going to\ndevelop and substantiate it before you start typing! (Try the roommate test: if you can't\nsay the main idea of your paper in a clear sentence to your roommate or someone who\ndoesn't know anything about the topic, then you are not ready to begin writing.) Your\nthesis statement may come to you instantly in a flash of inspiration, or--more likely--\nyou will have to do some preliminary note-taking, perhaps writing (akin to a response\npaper or freewrite), and perhaps talking through your ideas before you arrive at a thesis.\n\n- Take some time to look back over the readings and your notes as you are thinking about\nhow to formulate your thesis. Which materials should you focus on? I would expect to\nsee the following readings and details from lectures and films somewhere in your essay:\no Cronon, Changes in the Land\no Steinberg, Nature Incorporated\no Cronon, Nature's Metropolis\no Lowell textile industry\no Railroads (transcontinental and otherwise)\no The \"blueprint of modern America\":\nHomestead Act (May 1862)\nPacific Railroad Act (July 1862)\nMorrill Land Grant Act (July 1862)\n(Of course you are free to include other readings and details as well.)\n\n- Remember that all the supporting evidence you use--quotations, paraphrases, examples,\nspecific historical details--should be in the service of your own argument. It is important\nto demonstrate your knowledge of the material, but you shouldn't allow the readings to\ntake over your essay. (And definitely avoid merely summarizing the reading or stringing\ntogether extended quotations!) Your voice should be the primary one making the\nargument; bring in Cronon, Steinberg, and others as secondary voices to support your\nassertions.\n\n- How should you organize your paper? Sometimes it is tempting in a comparative essay\nto say everything you want to say about apples and then say everything you want to say\nabout oranges. Or, in your case, first New England and then the Great West. But using\nthat kind of structure will jumble your points of comparison all together. By the time you\nget to your third major point about the Great West, your reader will have to remember all\nthe way back to your New England section to draw a comparison. A better way to\norganize a paper like this is to adopt a point-by-point structure in which each subtopic\nrelates back to your thesis:\no Subtopic #1\nNew England\nGreat West\no Subtopic #2\nNew England\nGreat West\no And so on...\n\n- To figure out whether your paragraph structure works, try cutting and pasting all your\ntopic sentences into a separate document, compressing them into one paragraph. Then\nread that paragraph. If the logic follows from sentence to sentence without any gaps,\nthen you have a cohesive paragraph structure (and probably a very good argument).\n\n- Finally, the best way to proofread is to read your paper aloud, slowly and carefully, as\nthough you were delivering a speech. Again a roommate or unsuspecting friend can\ncome in handy."

Keep not standing fix'd and rooted,\nBriskly venture, briskly roam ;\nHead and hand, where'er thou foot it,\nAnd stout heart are still at home.\nIn each land the sun does visit\nWe are gay, whate'er betide :\nTo give room, for wandering is it\nThat the world was made so wide.\"\nTHE tendency nowadays to wander in wilder-\nnesses is delightful to see.\nThousands of\ntired,\nnerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning\nto find out that going to the mountains is going\nhome\n;\nthat wildness\nis a\nnecessity\n;\nand\nthat\nmountain parks and reservations are useful not\nonly as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers,\nbut as fountains of\nlife.\nAwakening from the\nstupefying\neffects of\nthe\nvice\nof over-industry\nand the deadly apathy of luxury, they are trying\nas best they can\nto mix and enrich\ntheir own\nlittle ongoings with those of Nature, and\nto get\nrid of\nrust and disease.\nBriskly venturing and\n\nOUR NATIONAL PARKS\nroaming, some are washing\noff\nsins and cobweb\ncares of the devil's spinning in all-day storms on\nmountains ;\nsauntering in rosiny pinewoods\nor\nin gentian meadows, brushing through chaparral,\nbending down and parting sweet, flowery sprays ;\ntracing rivers to their sources, getting\nin touch\nwith the nerves of Mother Earth\n; jumping from\nrock\nto\nrock, feeling the\nlife of them, learning\nthe songs of them, panting in whole-souled exer-\ncise, and rejoicing\nin\ndeep, long-drawn breaths\nof pure wildness.\nThis\nis\nfine and natural and\nfull\nof\npromise.\nSo\nalso\nis\nthe\ngrowing\nin-\nterest\nin\nthe\ncare\nand preservation\nof\nforests\nand wild places\nin general, and\nin the half wild\nparks and gardens of towns.\nEven the scenery\nhabit\nin\nits most\nartificial\nforms, mixed with\nspectacles,\nsilliness,\nand\nkodaks\n;\nits\ndevotees\narrayed more gorgeously than\nscarlet\ntanagers,\nfrightening the wild game with red umbrellas,\neven\nthis\nis encouraging, and may well\nbe\nregarded as a hopeful sign of the times.\nAll\nthe Western mountains\nare\nstill\nrich\nin\nwildness, and by means of good roads are being\nbrought neater\ncivilization every year.\nTo the\nsane and free\nit\nwill hardly seem necessary to\ncross\nthe continent\nin\nsearch of wild\nbeauty,\nhowever easy the way, for they find\nit\nin abun-\ndance wherever they chance to\nbe.\nLike Tho-\nreau they see forests\nin orchards and patches of\nhuckleberry\nbrush, and\noceans\nin\nponds and\n\nLOCATION AND EXTENT\nOF THE\nPOREST RESERVES & NATIONAL PARKS\nWESTERN UNITED STATES\nTo 3rd, August, 1901.\nScale of Mile*\nl-V.v.v.-.-.l FOREST RESERVES\n\nWILD PARKS OF THE WEST\ndrops of dew.\nFew in these hot, dim, strenuous\ntimes are quite sane\nor free\n; choked with\ncare\nlike\nclocks\nfull of\ndust, laboriously doing\nso\nmuch good and making so much money,\nor so\nlittle,\nthey are no longer good for themselves.\nWhen,\nlike a merchant\ntaking a\nlist of\nhis\ngoods, we\ntake stock\nof\nour\nwildness, we are\nglad to see how much of even the most\ndestruc-\ntible kind\nis\nstill\nunspoiled.\nLooking\nat our\ncontinent\nas scenery when\nit was all wild, lying\nbetween\nbeautiful\nseas, the\nstarry sky above\nit,\nthe starry rocks beneath\nit, to compare its sides,\nthe East and the West, would be like comparing\nthe\nsides\nof\na rainbow.\nBut\nit\nis no\nlonger\nequally beautiful.\nThe rainbows of to-day are,\nI suppose, as bright as those\nthat\nfirst spanned\nthe sky ; and some of our landscapes are grow-\ning more beautiful from year\nto year, notwith-\nstanding the\nclearing, trampling work of\ncivili-\nzation.\nNew plants and animals are enriching\nwoods and gardens, and many landscapes wholly\nnew, with divine sculpture and\narchitecture, are\njust now coming to the light of day as the man-\ntling folds of\ncreative\nglaciers are being with-\ndrawn, and life in a thousand cheerful, beautiful\nforms is pushing into them, and new-born rivers\nare beginning to sing and shine\nin them.\nThe\nold rivers, too, are growing longer,\nlike healthy\ntrees, gaining new branches and\nlakes\nas\nthe\nresidual glaciers at\ntheir highest sources on the\n\nOUR NATIONAL PARKS\nmountains\nrecede,\nwhile the\nrootlike\nbranches\nin their flat deltas are at the same time spreading\nfarther and wider into the seas and making new\nlands.\nUnder\nthe\ncontrol\nof\nthe\nvast\nmysterious\nforces of the\ninterior of the earth all the conti-\nnents and\nislands\nare\nslowly rising\nor\nsinking.\nMost of the mountains are diminishing\nin\nsize\nunder the wearing action of the weather, though\na few are' increasing\nin height and\ngirth, espe-\ncially th~vofeamc ones, as fresh floods of molten\nrocks are piIM..on\ntheir summits and spread\nin\nsuccessive layers, like the wood-rings of trees, on\ntheir sides.\nNew mountains, also, are being cre-\nated from time\nto time as\nislands in lakes and\nseas, or as subordinate cones on the slopes of old\nones, thus in some measure balancing the waste\nof\nold beauty with new.\nMan, too,\nis making\nmany far-reaching\nchanges.\nThis\nmost' influ-\nential half animal, half angel is rapidly multiply-\ning and spreading, covering the\nseas and lakes\nwith ships, the land with huts, hotels, cathedrals,\nand clustered city shops and homes, so that soon,\nit would seem, we may have\nto go farther than\nNansen to find a good sound solitude.\nNone of\nNature's landscapes are ugly so long as they are\nwild ; and much, we can say comfortingly, must\nalways be in great part wild, particularly the sea\nand the sky, the\nfloods of\nlight from the stars,\nand the warm,\nunspoilable heart of\nthe\nearth,\n\nWILD PARKS OF THE WEST\ninfinitely beautiful, though only dimly visible to\nthe\neye\nof\nimagination.\nThe\ngeysers,\ntoo,\nspouting from the hot underworld ; the steady,\nlong-lasting glaciers on the mountains, obedient\nonly\nto the sun\n; Yosemite domes and the\ntre-\nmendous grandeur\nof rocky canons and moun-\ntains\nin general,\nthese must always be\nwild,\nfor man can change them and mar them hardly\nmore than can the butterflies that hover above\nthem.\nBut the continent's outer beauty\nis fast\npassing away, especially the plant part of\nit, the\nmost destructible and most\nuniversally charming\nof aft\nOnly thirty years ago, the great Central Val-\nley of\nCalifornia,\nfive hundred miles long and\nfifty miles wide, was one bed of golden and pur-\nple\nflowers.\nNow it\nis ploughed and pastured\nout of\nexistence, gone forever,\nscarce a mem-\nory of\nit\nleft\nin fence\ncorners and\nalong the\nbluffs of the streams.\nThe gardens\nof the Si-\nerra, also, and the noble\nforests\nin both the re-\nserved and unreserved portions are sadly haeked\nand\ntrampled, notwithstanding the\nruggedness\nof the topography,\nall excepting those of the\nparks guarded by a few soldiers.\nIn the noblest\nforests\nof the world, the ground, once\ndivinely\nbeautiful,\nis\ndesolate and\nrepulsive, like a face\nravaged by disease.\nThis\nis true also of many\nother Pacific Coast and Kocky Mountain valleys\nand forests.\nThe same\nfate, sooner or later, is\n\nOUR NATIONAL PARKS\nawaiting them all, unless awakening public opin-\nion comes forward to\nstop it.\nEven the great\ndeserts in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and New Mex-\nico, which\noffer so\nlittle to\nattract\nsettlers, and\nwhich a few years ago pioneers were afraid\nof,\nas places of desolation and death, are now taken\nas\npastures\nat the\nrate\nof\none\nor two\nsquare\nmiles per cow, and of course their plant treasures\nare\npassing\naway,\nthe\ndelicate\nabronias,\nphloxes,\ngilias,\netc.\nOnly a few of the\nbitter,\nthorny, unbitable shrubs are left, and the sturdy\ncactuses that defend\nthemselves with bayonets\nand spears.\nMost of the wild plant wealth of the East also\nhas vanished,\ngone into dusty history.\nOnly\nvestiges\nof\nits\nglorious\nprairie\nand woodland\nwealth remain to bless humanity in boggy, rocky,\nunploughable places.\nFortunately, some of these\nare purely wild, and go far to keep Nature's love\nvisible.\nWhite water-lilies, with rootstocks deep\nand\nsafe\nin, mud,\nstill send up every summer a\nMilky Way of\nstarry, fragrant flowers around a\nthousand\nlakes, and many a\ntuft of wild grass\nwaves its\npanicles on mossy rocks, beyond reach\nof trampling\nfeet,\nin company with\nsaxifrages,\nbluebells, and ferns.\nEven in the midst of farm-\ners'\nfields,\nprecious\nsphagnum\nbogs, too\nsoft\nfor the\nfeet\nof\ncattle, are preserved with\ntheir\ncharming\nplants\nunchanged,\nchiogenes, An-\ndromeda, Kalmia,\nLinnsea, Arethusa,\netc.\nCa-\n\nWILD PARKS OF THE WEST\nlypso borealis still hides in the arbor vitse swamps\nof Canada, and away to the southward there are\na few unspoiled swamps, big ones, where miasma,\nsnakes, and\nalligators, like guardian\nangels, de-\nfend\ntheir treasures and keep them as pure as\nparadise.\nAnd beside\na'\nthat and\na'\nthat, the\nEast is blessed with good winters and blossoming\nclouds that shed white flowers over\nall the land,\ncovering every scar and making the saddest land-\nscape divine at least once a year.\nThe most extensive,\nleast\nspoiled, and\nmost\nunspoilable of the gardens of the continent are\nthe vast tundras\nof\nAlaska.\nIn summer\nthey\nextend smooth, even, undulating, continuous beds\nof flowers\nand\nleaves\nfrom about\nlat.\nto\nthe shores of the Arctic Ocean\n; and\nin winter\nsheets of snowflowers make all the country shine,\none mass of white radiance like a star.\nNor are\nthese Arctic plant people the pitiful frost-pinched\nunfortunates they are guessed to be by those who\nhave never seen them.\nThough lowly in stature,\nkeeping near the frozen ground\nas\nif loving it,\nthey are bright and cheery, and speak Nature's\nlove as plainly as their big relatives of the South.\nTenderly happed and tucked\nin beneath downy\nsnow\nto\nsleep through the long, white\nwinter,\nthey make haste to bloom in the spring without\ntrying to grow tall, though some rise high enough\nto\nripple\nand wave\nin\nthe wind, and\ndisplay\nmasses of color,\nyellow, purple, and blue,\nso\n\nOUR NATIONAL PARKS\nrich that they look\nlike beds\nof rainbows, and\nare visible miles and miles away.\nAs early as June one may find the showy Geum\nglaciale in flower, and the dwarf willows putting\nforth myriads\nof fuzzy\ncatkins, to be followed\nquickly, especially on the dryer ground, by mer-\ntensia, eritrichium, polemonium, oxytropis, astra-\ngalus, lathyrus,\nlupinus, myosotis, dodecatheon,\narnica,\nchrysanthemum,\nnardosmia,\nsaussurea,\nsenecio,\nerigeron,\nmatrecaria,\ncaltha,\nvaleriana,\nstellaria,\nTofieldia, polygonum, papaver, phlox,\nlychnis, cheiranthus, Linnsea, and a host of\ndra-\nbas, saxifrages, and heathworts, with bright stars\nand bells in glorious profusion, particularly Cassi-\nope, Andromeda, ledum, pyrola, and vaecinium,\nCassiope the most abundant and beautiful of\nthem\nall.\nMany grasses\nalso\ngrow\nhere, and\nwave\nfine\npurple\nspikes and panicles over the\nother\nflowers,\npoa,\naira, calamagrostis, alope-\ncurus,\ntrisetum,\nelymus,\nfestuca,\nglyceria,\netc.\nEven ferns are found\nthus\nfar north, carefully\nand comfortably unrolling their precious fronds,\naspidium,\ncystopteris, and woodsia, all grow-\ning on a sumptuous bed of mosses and lichens ;\nnot the scaly lichens seen on rails and trees and\nfallen logs to the southward, but massive, round-\nheaded, finely colored plants like corals, wonder-\nfully beautiful, worth going round the world to\nsee.\nI\nshould\nlike\nto mention\nall\nthe\nplant\nfriends\nI found\nin a summer's wanderings\nin\n\nWILD PARKS OF THE WEST\nthis cool\nreserve, but I fear few would care to\nread their names, although everybody, I am sure,\nwould love them could they see them blooming\nand rejoicing at home.\nOn my last visit to the region about Kotzebue\nSound, near the middle of September, 1881, the\nweather was so fine and mellow that it suggested\nthe Indian summer of the Eastern States.\nThe\nwinds were hushed, the tundra glowed in creamy\ngolden sunshine, and the colors of the ripe foli-\nage of the heathworts, willows, and birch\nred,\npurple, and yellow, in pure bright tones\nwere\nenriched with\nthose\nof berries which were\nscat-\ntered everywhere', as if they had been showered\nfrom the clouds\nlike\nhail.\nWhen I was back a\nmile or two from the shore, reveling in this color-\nglory, and thinking how fine it would be could I\ncut a square of the tundra sod of conventional\npicture\nsize, frame\nit, and hang\nit among the\npaintings on my study walls\nat home, saying to\nmyself, \" Such a Nature painting taken\nat ran-\ndom from any part\nof\nthe\nthousand-mile bog\nwould make the\nother\npictures look\ndim\nand\ncoarse,\"\nI heard merry shouting, and, looking\nround, saw a band\nof Eskimos\nmen, women,\nand\nchildren, loose and hairy like wild animals\nrunning towards me.\nI could not guess at\nfirst what they were\nseeking,\nfor they seldom\nleave the shore\n; but soon they told me, as they\nthrew themselves down, sprawling and laughing,\n\nOUR NATIONAL PARKS\non the mellow bog, and began\nto\nfeast on the\nberries.\nA lively picture they made, and a pleas-\nant one, as they frightened the whirring ptarmi-\ngans, and surprised\ntheir oily stomachs with the\nbeautiful acid\nberries of many kinds, and\nfilled\nsealskin bags with them to carry away for festive\ndays in winter.\nNowhere\nelse on my\ntravels have I seen\nso\nmuch\nwarm-blooded,\nrejoicing\nlife\nas\nin\nthis\ngrand Arctic\nreservation, by\nso many regarded\nas desolate.\nNot only are there whales in abun-\ndance along the shores, and innumerable\nseals,\nwalruses, and white\nbears, but on\nthe\ntundras\ngreat herds of fat reindeer and wild sheep, foxes,\nhares, mice, piping marmots, and birds.\nPerhaps\nmore birds are born here than\nin any other re-\ngion of equal extent on the continent.\nNot only\ndo strong-winged hawks, eagles, and water-fowl,\nto whom the length of the continent is merely a\npleasant excursion, come up here every summer\nin great numbers, but\nalso many short-winged\nwarblers, thrushes, and\nfinches, repairing hither\nto rear their young in safety, reinforce the plant\nbloom with\ntheir plumage, and sweeten the wil-\nderness with song;\nflying\nall the way, some\nof\nthem, from Florida, Mexico, and Central Amer-\nica.\nIn coming north they are coming home,\nfor they were born here, and they go south only\nto spend the winter months, as New Englanders\ngo\nto\nFlorida.\nSweet-voiced troubadours, they\n\nWILD PARKS OF THE WEST\nsing in orange\ngroves and vine-clad\nmagnolia\nwoods in winter, in thickets of dwarf birch and\nalder in summer, and sing and\nchatter more\nor\nless\nall\nthe way back and\nforth, keeping\nthe\nwhole country\nglad.\nOftentimes, in New Eng-\nland,\njust as the\nlast snow-patches are melting\nand the\nsap\nin the maples begins to\nflow, the\nblessed wanderers may be heard about orchards\nand the edges of fields where they have stopped\nto glean a scanty meal, not tarrying long, know-\ning they have far to go.\nTracing the footsteps\nof spring, they arrive\nin their tundra homes in\nJune or July, and set out on their return journey\nin September, or as soon as their families are able\nto fly well.\nThis\nis\nNature's own\nreservation, and every\nlover\nof wildness\nwill\nrejoice with me that by\nkindly frost it is so well defended.\nThe\ndiscov-\nery\nlately made\nthat\nit\nis\nsprinkled with gold\nmay cause some alarm ;\nfor the strangely excit-\ning stuff makes the timid bold enough for any-\nthing, and\nthe\nlazy\ndestructively\nindustrious.\nThousands at least half insane are now pushing\ntheir way into\nit, some by the southern\npasses\nover\nthe mountains, perchance the\nfirst moun-\ntains they have\never\nseen,\nsprawling,\nstrug-\ngling, gasping for breath, as, laden with awkward,\nmerciless burdens\nof provisions and\ntools, they\nclimb over rough-angled boulders and cross thin\nmiry bogs.\nSome are going by the mountains\n\nOUR NATIONAL PARKS\nand\nrivers\nto\nthe\neastward\nthrough\nCanada,\ntracing\nthe\nold romantic ways\nof\nthe Hudson\nBay traders ;\nothers by Bering Sea and the Yu-\nkon,\nsailing\nall the way, getting glimpses\nper-\nhaps\nof the famous\nfur-seals, the\nice-floes, and\nthe innumerable islands and\nbars\nof the great\nAlaska\nriver.\nIn\nspite of\nfrowning\nhardships\nand the frozen ground, the Klondike gold will\nincrease the crusading crowds for years to come,\nbut\ncomparatively\nlittle\nharm\nwill\nbe\ndone.\nHoles\nwih\nbe burned\nand dug\ninto\nthe hard\nground here and there, and into the quartz-ribbed\nmountains and\nhills\n; ragged towns\nlike beaver\nand muskrat villages will be built, and mills and\nlocomotives will make rumbling, screeching, dis-\nenchanting noises\n; but the miner's pick will not\nbe followed far by the plough, at least not until\nNature\nis\nready to unlock\nthe frozen\nsoil-beds\nwith her slow-turning climate key.\nOn the other\nhand, the roads of\nthe pioneer miners\nwill lead\nmany a lover of wildness into the\nheart\nof\nthe\nreserve, who without them would never see it.\nIn the meantime, the wildest health and plea-\nsure grounds\naccessible and available to tourists\nseeking\nescape from\ncare\nand dust and\nearly\ndeath are the parks and reservations of the West.\nThere are four\nnational parks,\nthe\nYellow-\nstone, Yosemite, General Grant, and Sequoia,\nall within easy reach, and\nthirty forest\nreserva-\n1 There are now five parks and thirty-eight reservations.\n\nWILD PARKS OF THE WEST\ntions,\na\nmagnificent realm\nof\nwoods, most\nof\nwhich, by railroads and trails and open ridges, is\nalso fairly accessible, not only to the determined\ntraveler rejoicing in difficulties, but to those (may\ntheir tribe increase) who, not tired, not sick, just\nnaturally take wing every summer\nin search of\nwildness.\nThe forty million\nacres\nof\nthese re-\nserves are in the main unspoiled\nas yet, though\nsadly wasted and threatened

with\nbright\ngreen\ndrooping\nfoliage, handsome pendent\ncones, and\na shaft exquisitely straight and round and\nreg-\nular.\nForming\nextensive\nforests\nby\nitself\nin\nmany places,

the\nclose of the glacial period.\nIn proportion to its weight when dry, Douglas\nspruce timber\nis perhaps\nstronger than that of\nany other large conifer in the country, and being\ntough, durable, and elastic,\nit is admirably suited\nfor\nship-building,\npiles, and\nheavy timbers\nin\ngeneral ; but\nits hardness and\nliability to warp\nwhen it is cut into boards render it unfit for

many of the long, slender\nboles\nare saved\nfor spars;\nand so superior\nis\ntheir quality that they are\ncalled for\nin almost\nevery shipyard in the world, and it is interesting\nto follow their fortunes.\nFeUed and peeled and\ndragged to\ntide-water, they are\nraised again as\nyards and masts for ships, given iron roots and\ncanvas foliage, decorated with\nflags, and sent to\nsea, where\nin glad motion they go cheerily over\nthe ocean prairie in every latitude and longitude,\nsinging and bowing responsive to the same winds\nthat waved them when they were\nin\nthe woods.\nAfter standing in one place for\ncenturies they\nthus go round\nthe world\nlike tourists, meeting\nmany a friend from the old home forest\n; some\ntraveling\nlike\nthemselves, some\nstanding\nhead\ndownward\nin muddy\nharbors,\nholding up\nthe\nplatforms of wharves, and others doing all kinds\nof hard timber work, showy or hidden.\nThis wonderful tree also grows far northward\nin\nBritish Columbia, and\nsouthward along the\ncoast and middle regions of Oregon and Califor-\nnia ;\nflourishing with\nthe redwood wherever\nit\ncan\nfind an opening, and with\nthe sugar\npine,\nyellow pine, and

and\nsome parts of British Columbia does it reach per-\nfect development.\nTo one who looks from some high standpoint\nover its vast breadth, the forest on the west side\nof the Cascades seems all one dim, dark, monoto-\nnous\nfield, broken\nonly by the white\nvolcanic\ncones along the summit of the\nrange.\nBack in\nthe untrodden wilderness a deep furred carpet of\nbrown and yellow mosses covers the ground like\na garment, pressing about the\nfeet of\nthe trees,\nand rising in rich bosses\nsoftly and kindly over\nevery rock and mouldering trunk, leaving no spot\nuncared\nfor\n; and\ndotting\nsmall\nprairies, and\nfringing the meadows and the banks of streams\nnot seen\nin general views, we\nfind, besides the\ngreat\nconifers, a\nconsiderable number of hard-\nwood trees,\noak, ash, maple, alder, wild apple,\ncherry, arbutus,\nNuttall's\nflowering\ndogwood,\nand in some places\nchestnut.\nIn a few favored\nspots the broad-leaved maple grows\nto a height\nof a hundred feet in forests by itself, sending out\nlarge limbs in magnificent interlacing arches cov-\nered with mosses and\nferns, thus forming lofty\nsky-gardens, and rendering the underwoods\nde-\nlightfully cool.\nNo\nfiner forest\nceiling is to be\nfound than these maple\narches, while the floor,\n\nWILD PAEKS OF THE WEST\nornamented with tall ferns and rubus vines, and\ncast into\nhillocks by the bulging, moss-covered\nroots of the trees, matches it well.\nPassing from beneath the heavy shadows of\nthe woods, almost anywhere one steps into lovely\ngardens\nof\nlilies, orchids,\nheathworts, and wild\nroses.\nAlong the lower slopes, especially in Ore-\ngon, where\nthe woods are\nless\ndense, there are\nmiles of rhododendron, making\nglorious

north,\nCalypso.\nBeside\nall\nthese\nbloomers there are wonderful ferneries about the\nmany misty waterfalls, some\nof the fronds ten\nfeet high, others the most delicate of\ntheir tribe,\nthe maidenhair fringing the rocks within reach of\nthe lightest dust of the spray, while the shading\ntrees on the cliffs above them, leaning over, look\nlike eager listeners anxious\nto catch every tone\nof the restless waters.\nIn the autumn berries of\nevery color and flavor abound, enough for birds,\nbears,\nand\neverybody,\nparticularly\nabout\nthe\nstream-sides and meadows where sunshine reaches\nthe ground\n:\nhuckleberries, red, blue, and black,\nsome growing\nclose\nto\nthe ground\nothers on\n\nOUR NATIONAL PARKS\nbushes ten\nfeet high ; gaultheria\nberries, called\n\" sal-al

than\nthe\nfruit;\nraspberries,\ngooseberries,\ncurrants,\nblackberries, and strawberries.\nThe underbrush\nand meadow fringes are in great part made up of\nthese berry bushes and vines ; but in the depths\nof\nthe woods\nthere\nis not much underbrush of\nany kind,\nonly a thin growth of rubus, huckle-\nberry, and vine-maple.\nNotwithstanding the outcry against the\nreser-\nvations\nlast\nwinter\nin\nWashington,\nthat\nun-\ncounted farms, towns, and villages were included\nin them, and that all business was threatened or\nblocked, nearly all the mountains\nin which the\nreserves lie are still covered with virgin\nforests.\nThough lumbering has long been carried on with\ntremendous energy along their boundaries, and\nhome-seekers have explored the woods for open-\nings available for farms, however small, one may\nwander\nin the\nheart\nof the reserves for weeks\nwithout meeting a human being, Indian or white\nman, or any conspicuous trace\nof\none.\nIndians\nused to ascend the main streams on their way to\nthe mountains for wild\ngoats, whose wool\nfur-\nnished them clothing.\nBut with food\nin abun-\ndance on the coast there was little to draw them\ninto\nthe woods, and the monuments they have\nleft there\nare\nscarcely more\nconspicuous\nthan\n\nWILD PARKS OF THE WEST\nthose\nof\nbirds and\nsquirrels\n;\nfar\nless\nso

immigrants from the Eastern\nStates settled in the fertile and open Willamette\nValley of Oregon.\nEven now, when the search\nfor tillable land is so keen, excepting the bottom-\nlands of the\nrivers around Puget Sound, there\nare few cleared spots in all western Washington.\nOn every meadow or opening\nof any\nsort some\none will be found keeping\ncattle, raising\nhops,\nor cultivating patches\nof\ngrain, but these spots\nare few and far between.\nAll the\nlarger spaces\nwere taken\nlong\nago\n;\ntherefore\nmost\nof\nthe\nnewcomers build their cabins where\nthe beavers\nbuilt theirs.\nThey keep a few cows, laboriously\nwiden their little meadow openings by hacking,\ngirdling, and burning the rim of the close-press-\ning forest, and scratch and plant among the huge\nblackened logs and stumps, girdling and\nkilling\nthemselves in killing the trees.\nMost of\nthe farm lands\nof Washington and\nOregon, excepting the valleys of the Willamette\nand

loading their branches, and bend-\ning them down\nagainst\nthe\ntrunks until\nthey\nlook like arrows, while a strange muffled silence\nprevails, making everything impressively solemn.\nBut these

the Paton hemlock, the most graceful\nof evergreens, the curious tumion, oaks of many\nspecies,\nmaples,\nalders,\npoplars, and\nflowering\ndogwood,\nall fringed with flowery underbrush,\nmanzanita, ceanothus, wild rose, cherry, chestnut,\nand\nrhododendron.\nWandering\nat\nrandom\nthrough these friendly, approachable woods, one\ncomes here and there to the loveliest lily gardens,\nsome of the

it\nis\nleft\nwholly unguarded, though the management of\nthe adjacent\nnational\nparks by a few\nsoldiers\nshows how well and how\neasily\nit can be pre-\nserved.\nIn\nthe\nmeantime,

plains.\nTheir\nhigher ridges, however, and mountains are open,\nand\nfairly well forested with sugar\npine, yellow\npine, Douglas\nspruce, libocedrus, and white\nfir.\nAs timber fountains they amount to little, but as\nbird and bee pastures, cover\nfor\nthe\nprecious\nstreams that\nirrigate the lowlands, and quickly\navailable retreats from dust and heat and care,\ntheir

while breathing reviving ozone, they may\nabsorb the beauty about them, and look comfort-\nably down on\nthe\nbusy towns\nand\nthe\nmost\nbeautiful orange groves ever planted\nsince gar-\ndening
