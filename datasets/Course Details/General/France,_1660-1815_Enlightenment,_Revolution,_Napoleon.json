  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nSubject Description\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 stands at the crossroads of modern French history, and perhaps of western and world history more generally. Since its outbreak, observers have debated the following questions: Why did the Revolution begin? When did it end? In what ways does 1789 constitute a rupture with the French Old Regime? The answers to these questions continue to have a surprising relevance. In this class, we will study the century and a half of French history prior to 1789 in some detail, then examine some of the central events and issues of the Revolution and its Napoleonic sequel.\n\nSubject Requirements\n\nAttendance and class participation is mandatory. Students will write three 3-page papers, due in class on the dates indicated below, and a final paper of at least 10 pages in length. Each student will also present an oral report based on the final paper. I will hand out instructions for these assignments later in the semester. Each assignment will be weighted as follows in the calculation of the final grade, although these calculations will also take into account improved performance during the course of the semester:\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass participation\n\n25 points\n\nThree-page papers\n\n25 points each (75 points total)\n\nFinal paper\n\n75 points\n\nOral presentation\n\n25 points\n\nTotal\n\n200 points\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nWeek #1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWeek #2\n\nThe Material World and the Political Background\n\n1789: Lists of Grievances\n\nWeek #3\n\nThe Theory and Practice of Absolutism under Louis XIV\n\nTaxes and Provincial Reform\n\nWeek #4\n\nTartuffe I\n\nTartuffe II\n\nWeek #5\n\nIntroduction to the Eighteenth Century\n\nFirst Paper Due\n\nReligion in France from Louis XIV to the Revolution\n\nWeek #6\n\nThe\nEncyclopedie\nI\n\nThe\nEncyclopedie\nII\n\nVisit to the MIT Archives\n\nWeek #7\n\nMahomet\nI\n\nMahomet\nII\n\nWeek #8\n\nPopular Culture and Politics I: Workers and Servants\n\nPopular Culture and Politics II: Theater and Song\n\nSecond Paper Due\n\nWeek #9\n\n1789: The Abolition of Feudalism and the Rights of Man\n\nSummary of Final Paper Due\n\nThe Revolution and Religion\n\nWeek #10\n\nSlavery, Feminism, and the Revolution\n\nTheater, Politics, and Society During the Revolution\n\nWeek #11\n\nNo Class\n\nThe Dilemma of the Terror\n\nThird Paper Due\n\nWeek #12\n\nNapoleon, the Politician and Legislator\n\nNapoleon, the Emperor\n\nWeek #13\n\nOral Presentations\n\nOral Presentations (cont.)\n\nWeek #14\n\nIndividual Consultations with Instructor\n\nConclusion",
