Critical points: fx = y-3x2y-y3 = 0,\nfy = x -x3 -3xy2 = 0.\nb) Assuming x > 0 and y > 0, the equations can be rewritten as 1-3x2-y2 = 0, 1-x2 -3y2 = 0.\nSolution: x2 = y2 = 1/4, i.e. (x, y) = (1/2, 1/2).\nc) fxx = -6xy = -3/2, fyy = -6xy = -3/2, fxy = 1 -3x\n2 = -1/2. So fxxfyy\nxy > 0,\n2 -3y\n-f2\nand fxx < 0, it is a local maximum.\nd) The maximum of f lies either at (1/2, 1/2), or on the boundary of the domain or at infinity.\nSince f(x, y) = xy(1 -x2 -y2), f = 0 when either x → 0 or y → 0, and f →-inf when x →inf or\ny →inf (since x2 + y2 →inf). So the maximum is at (x, y) = (2\n1 , 2\n1 ), where f( 2\n1 , 2\n1 ) = 8\n1 .\nProblem 5.\na) f(x, y, z) = xyz, g(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z = 1 : one must solve the Lagrange multiplier\nequation ∇f = λ∇g, i.e. yz = 2λx, xz = 2λy, xy = λ, and the constraint equation x2 + y2 + z = 1.\nb) Dividing the first two equations yz = 2λx and xz = 2λy by each other, we get y/x = x/y,\nso x2 = y2; since x > 0 and y > 0 we get y = x. Substituting this into the Lagrange multiplier\nequations, we get z = 2λ and x2 = λ.

A vector (notation: A~) has a direction, and a length (|A~|). It is represented by\na directed line segment. In a coordinate system it's expressed by components: in space, A~ =\nha1, a2, a3i = a1ˆı + a2ˆj + a3kˆ. (Recall in space x-axis points to the lower-left, y to the right, z up).\nScalar multiplication\nFormula for length? Showed picture of h3, 2, 1i and used flashcards to ask for its length. Most\nstudents got the right answer (\n√\n14).\n\nwhy |A~| =\na1\n2 + a2\n2 + a3\n2 by reducing to the Pythagorean theorem in the\nplane (Draw a picture,\n\nshowing\n\nA~ and its projection to the xy-plane, then derived |A~|\n\nfrom length\nof projection + Pythagorean theorem).\nVector addition: A~+B~ by head-to-tail addition:\n\nin a parallelogram (showed how\nthe diagonals are A~ + B~ and B~ - A~);\n\nA~ = 3ˆı + 2ˆj + kˆ on the displayed example.\nDot product.\nDefinition: A~ B~ = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3 (a scalar, not a vector).\n·\nTheorem: geometrically, A~ · B~ = |A~||B~| cos θ.\nExplained the theorem as follows: first, A~ A~ = A~ 2 cos 0 = |A~ 2 is consistent with the definition.\n·\n| |\n|\nNext, consider a triangle with sides A~, B~, C~ = A~ - B~. Then the law of cosines gives C~\n=\n|A~|2 + |B~|2 - 2|A~||B~| cos θ, while we get\n| |\nC\n= C C = (A~ - B~) (A~ - B~) = |A~ 2 + | ~\n- 2A~ B.\n| ~|2\n~ · ~\n·\n|\nB|2\n· ~\nHence the theorem is a vector formulation of the law of cosines.\nA~ B~\nApplications. 1) computing lengths and angles: cos θ =\n·\n.\n|A~||B~|\nExample: triangle in space with vertices P = (1, 0, 0), Q = (0, 1, 0), R = (0, 0, 2), find angle at P :\nPQ PR\ncos θ =\n-→· -→\n= h-1, 1, 0i · h-1, 0, 2i =\n1 ,\nθ ≈ 71.5*.\n|--→PR |\n√\n√\n√\nPQ ||--→\nNote the sign of dot product: positive if angle less than 90*, negative if angle more than 90*,\nzero if perpendicular.\n2) detecting orthogonality.\nExample: what is the set of points where x +2y +3z = 0? (possible answers: empty set, a point,\na line, a plane, a sphere, none of the above, I don't know).\nAnswer: plane; can see \"by hand\", but more geometrically use dot product: call A~ = h1, 2, 3i,\nP = (x, y, z), then A~ · OP = x + 2y + 3z = 0 ⇔| ~ OP | cos θ = 0 ⇔ θ = π/2 ⇔ ~\nOP . So we\n-→\nA||-→\nA ⊥ -→\nget the plane through O with normal vector A~.\nYou can explain\naddition works componentwise, and it is true that\nDraw a picture\n\n18.02 Lecture 2. - Fri, Sept 7, 2007\nWe've seen two applications of dot product: finding lengths/angles, and detecting orthogonality.\nA third one: finding components of a vector. If uˆ is a unit vector, A~ ·uˆ = |A~| cos θ is the component\nof A~ along the direction of uˆ. E.g., A~ ˆı = component of A~ along x-axis.\n·\nExample: pendulum making an angle with vertical, force = weight of pendulum F~ pointing\ndownwards: then the physically important quantities are the components of F~ along tangential\ndirection (causes pendulum's motion), and along normal direction (causes string tension).\nArea. E.g. of a polygon in plane: break into triangles. Area of triangle = 1 base × height =\n1 |A~||B~| sin θ (= 1/2 area of parallelogram). Could get sin θ using dot product to compute cos θ and\nsin2 + cos2 = 1, but it gives an ugly formula. Instead, reduce to complementary angle θ0 = π/2 - θ\nby considering A~0 = A~ rotated 90* counterclockwise (drew a picture). Then area of parallelogram\n= |A~||B~| sin θ = |A~0||B~| cos θ0 = A~0 · B~.\nQ: if A~ = ha1, a2i, then what is A~0? (showed picture, used flashcards). Answer: A~0 = h-a2, a1i.\n(explained on picture). So area of parallelogram is hb1, b2i · h-a2, a1i = a1b2 - a2b1.\na1 a2\nDeterminant.

Referred to the notes for more about\ndeterminants.\nCross-product. (only for 2 vectors in space); gives a vector, not a scalar (unlike dot-product).\nˆı\nˆj\nkˆ\na2 a3\na1 a3\n+ kˆ a1 a2\nA~ × B~ =\n= ˆı\n- ˆj\nDefinition:\na1 a2 a3\n.\nb2\nb3\nb1\nb3\nb1\nb2\nb1\nb2\nb3\n(the 3x3 determinant is a symbolic notation, the actual formula is the expansion).\nGeometrically: |A~ × B~| = area of space parallelogram with sides A~, B~; direction = normal to\nthe plane containing A~ and B~.\nHow to decide between the two perpendicular directions = right-hand rule. 1) extend right hand\nin direction of A~; 2) curl fingers towards direction of B~; 3) thumb points in same direction as A~ ×B~.\n\nˆı × ˆj =? (answer: kˆ, checked both by geometric description and by\ncalculation).\nTriple product: volume of parallelepiped = area(base) · height = |B~ × C~| (A~ · nˆ), where ˆn =\nB~ × ~ |B~ × ~|\n~ · (B~ × C~) = det( ~ B, ~\nC/\nC .

Often quantities are related by linear transformations; e.g. changing coordinate\nsystems, from P = (x1, x2, x3) to something more adapted to the problem, with new coordinates\n(u1, u2, u3). For example\n⎧\n⎨ u1 = 2x1 + 3x2 + 3x3\nu2 = 2x1 + 4x2 + 5x3\n⎩ u3 = x1 + x2 + 2x3\n⎡\n⎤⎡\n⎤\n⎡\n⎤\nx1\nu1\nRewrite using matrix product: ⎣ 2\n5 ⎦⎣ x2 ⎦ = ⎣ u2 ⎦, i.e. AX = U.\nx3\nu3\nEntries in the matrix product = dot product between rows of A and columns of X.

Recall an equation of the form ax + by + cz = d defines a plane.\n1) plane through origin with normal vector N = h1, 5, 10i: P = (x, y, z) is in the plane ⇔\nN -→= 0 ⇔h1, 5, 10i · hx, y, zi = x + 5y + 10z = 0. Coefficients of the equation are the\nOP\n·\ncomponents of the normal vector.\n2) plane through P0 = (2, 1, -1) with same normal vector N = h1, 5, 10i: parallel to the previous\none! P is in the plane ⇔ N · P0P = 0 ⇔ (x - 2) + 5(y - 1) + 10(z + 1) = 0, or x + 5y + 10z = -3.\n--→\nAgain coefficients of equation = components of normal vector.\n(Note: the equation multiplied by a constant still defines the same plane).\nSo, to find the equation of a plane, we really need to look for the normal vector N ; we can e.g.\nfind it by cross-product of 2 vectors that are in the plane.\nFlashcard question: the vector v = h1, 2, -1i and the plane x + y + 3z = 5 are 1) parallel, 2)\nperpendicular, 3) neither?\nperpendicular vector would be proportional to the coefficients, i.e. to h1, 1, 3i; let's test if\nit's in the plane: equivalent to being ⊥ N. We have v N = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0 so v is parallel to\nthe plane.)\n·\nInterpretation of 3x3 systems. A 3x3 system asks for the intersection of 3 planes. Two\nplanes intersect in a line, and usually the third plane intersects it in a single point (picture shown).\nThe unique solution to AX = B is given by X = A-1B.\n(A\n\nException: if the 3rd plane is parallel to the line of intersection of the first two? What can\nhappen? (asked on flashcards for possibilities).\n\nIf\nthe line P1 ∩P2 is contained in P3 there are infinitely many solutions (the line); if it is\nparallel to\n\nP3 there are no solutions. (could also get a plane of solutions if all three equations\nare the same)\nThese special cases correspond to systems with det(A) = 0. Then we can't invert A to solve the\nsystem: recall A-1 = det(\nA) adj(A). Theorem: A is invertible ⇔ det A = 0.\nHomogeneous systems: AX = 0. Then all 3 planes pass through the origin, so there is the\nobvious (\"trivial\") solution X = 0. If det A =6\n0 then this solution is unique: X = A-1 0 = 0.\nOtherwise, if det A = 0 there are infinitely many solutions (forming a line or a plane).\nNote: det A = 0 means det(N 1, N 2, N 3) = 0, where N i are the normals to the planes Pi. This\nmeans the parallelepiped formed by the N i has no area, i.e. they are coplanar (showed picture of 3\nplanes intersecting in a line, and their coplanar normals). The line of solutions is then perpendicular\nto the plane containing N i. For example we can get a vector along the line of intersection by taking\na cross-product N 1 × N 2.\nGeneral systems: AX = B: compared to AX = 0, all the planes are shifted to parallel\npositions from their initial ones. If det A =6\n0 then unique solution is X = A-1B. If det A = 0,\neither there are infinitely many solutions or there are no solutions.\n(We don't have tools to decide whether it's infinitely many or none, although elimination will\nlet us find out).\n18.02 Lecture 5. - Fri, Sept 14, 2007\nLines. We've seen a line as intersection of 2 planes. Other representation = parametric equation\n= as trajectory of a moving point.\nE.g. line through Q0 = (-1, 2, 2), Q1 = (1, 3, -1): moving point Q(t) starts at Q0 at t = 0, moves\nQ0Q1 ; ----→\nQ0Q1 .\nat constant speed along line, reaches Q1 at t = 1: its \"velocity\" is ~v = ---→Q0Q(t) = t---→\n⎧\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪\n⎩\nOn example: hx + 1, y - 2, z - 2i = th2, 1, -3i, i.e.\nx(t) = -1 + 2t,\ny(t) = 2 + t,\nz(t) = 2 - 3t\nLines and planes. Understand where lines and planes intersect.\nFlashcard question: relative positions of Q0, Q1 with respect to plane x + 2y + 4z = 7? (same\nside, opposite sides, one is in the plane, can't tell).\n(A sizeable number of students erroneously answered that one is in the plane.)\nAnswer: plug coordinates into equation of plane: at Q0, x+2y+4z = 11 > 7; at Q1, x+2y+4z =\n3 < 7; so opposite sides.\nIntersection of line Q0Q1 with plane? When does the moving point Q(t) lie in the plane? Check:\nat Q(t), x + 2y + 4z = (-1 + 2t) + 2(2 + t) + 4(2 - 3t) = 11 - 8t, so condition is 11 - 8t = 7, or\nt = 1/2. Intersection point: Q(t = 1\n2 ) = (0, 5/2, 1/2).\n\n(What would happen if the line was parallel to the plane, or inside it. Answer: when\nplugging the coordinates of Q(t) into the plane equation we'd get a constant, equal to 7 if the line\nis contained in the plane - so all values of t are solutions - or to something else if the line is parallel\nto the plane - so there are no solutions.)\n\nGeneral parametric curves.\nExample: cycloid: wheel rolling on floor, motion of a point P on the rim. (Drew picture, then\nshowed an applet illustrating the motion and plotting the cycloid).\nPosition of P ? Choice of parameter: e.g., θ, the angle the wheel has turned since initial position.\nDistance wheel has travelled is equal to arclength on circumference of the circle = aθ.\nSetup: x-axis = floor, initial position of P = origin; introduce A = point of contact of wheel on\nfloor, B = center of wheel. Decompose -→\nOP = -→\nAB + -→\nOA + -→\nBP .\n-→\nOA =\nAB\nh0, ai.\nBP\nhaθ, 0i; -→=\nLength of -→is a, and direction is θ from the (-y)-axis, so\n-→\nBP = h-a sin θ, -a cos θi.\nOP\nHence the position vector is -→= haθ - a sin θ, a - a cos θi.\nQ: What happens near bottom point? (flashcards: corner point with finite slopes on left and\nright; looped curve; smooth graph with horizontal tangent; vertical tangent (cusp)).\nAnswer: use Taylor approximation: for t\n0, f(t) ≈ f(0) + tf0(0) + 1 t2f00(0) + 1 t3f000(0) + . . . .\nThis gives sin θ ≈ θ - θ3/6 and cos θ ≈ 1 -\n→\nθ2/2. So x(θ) ' θ3/6, y(θ) ' θ2/2 Hence for θ\n0,\ny/x ' (1 θ2)/(1 θ3) = 3/θ →inf: vertical tangent.\n→"

It encodes how variations of f are related to variations of x, y, z. We\ncan use it in two ways:\n1. as a placeholder for approximation formulas: Δf ≈ fxΔx + fyΔy + fzΔz.\n2. divide by dt to get the chain rule: if x = x(t), y = y(t), z = z(t), then f becomes a function\nof t and df = fx\ndx + fy\ndy + fz\ndz\ndt\ndt\ndt\ndt\nExample: w = x2y + z, dw = 2xy dx + x2 dy + dz. If x = t, y = et , z = sin t then the chain rule\ngives dw/dt = (2tet) 1 + (t2) et + cos t, same as what we obtain by substitution into formula for w\nand one-variable differentiation.\nCan justify the chain rule in 2 ways:\n1. dx = x0(t) dt, dy = y0(t) dt, dz = z0(t) dt, so substituting we get dw = fxdx + fydy + fzdz =\nfx x0(t) dt + fy y0(t) dt + fz z0(t) dt, hence dw/dt.\n2.

In vector notation: dt = rw · dt .\nDefinition: rw = hwx, wy, wzi - GRADIENT VECTOR.\nTheorem: rw is perpendicular to the level surfaces w = c.\nExample 1: w = ax + by + cz, then w = d is a plane with normal vector rw = ha, b, ci.\nExample 2: w = x2 + y2, then w = c are circles, rw = h2x, 2yi points radially out so ⊥ circles.\nExample 3: w = x2 - y2, shown on applet (Lagrange multipliers applet with g disabled).\n\np\np\nrw is a vector whose value depends on the point (x, y) where we evaluate w.\n\nProof: take a curve ~r = ~r(t) contained inside level surface w = c. Then velocity ~v = d~r/dt is in\nthe tangent plane, and by chain rule, dw/dt = rw · d~r/dt = 0, so ~v ⊥rw. This is true for every ~v\nin the tangent plane.\nApplication: tangent plane to a surface. Example: tangent plane to x2 + y2 - z2 = 4 at (2, 1, 1):\ngradient is h2x, 2y, -2zi = h4, 2, -2i; tangent plane is 4x + 2y - 2z = 8.

Indeed, if F~ = rf then M = fx,\nN = fy, so Nx = fyx = fxy = My.\nClaim: Conversely, if F~ is defined and differentiable at every point of the plane, and Nx = My,\nthen F~ = Mˆı + Nˆj is a gradient field.\nExample: F~ = -yˆı + xˆj: Nx = 1, My = -1, so F~ is not a gradient field.\nExample: for which value(s) of a is F~ = (4x2 + axy)ˆı + (3y2 + 4x2)ˆj a gradient field? Answer:\nNx = 8x, My = ax, so a = 8.\nFinding the potential: if above test says F~ is a gradient field, we have 2 methods to find the\npotential function f. Illustrated for the above example (taking a = 8):\nMethod 1: using line integrals (FTC backwards):\nWe know that if C starts at (0, 0) and ends at (x1, y1) then f(x1, y1) - f(0, 0) =\nF~\nd~r. Here\nC\n·\nf(0, 0) is just an integration constant (if f is a potential then so is f + c). Can also choose the\nsimplest curve C from (0, 0) to (x1, y1).\nSimplest choice: take C = portion of x-axis from (0, 0) to (x1, 0), then vertical segment from\n(x1, 0) to (x1, y1) (picture drawn).\nThen\nF~\nd~r =\n(4x 2 + 8xy) dx + (3y 2 + 4x 2) dy:\n·\nC\nC1+C2\nx1\nx1\nOver C1, 0 ≤ x ≤ x1, y = 0, dy = 0:\n=\n(4x 2 + 8x 0) dx =\nx 3\n= x1\n3 .\n·\nZC1\nZ0\ny1\n\nOver C2, 0 ≤ y ≤ y1, x = x1, dx = 0:\n=\n(3y 2 + 4x 2) dy = y 3 + 4x1\n2 y\ny1 = y 3 + 4x1\n2 y1.\nC2\nSo f(x1, y1) = x 3\n1 + y1\n3 + 4x1\n2 y1 (+constant).\nMethod 2: using antiderivatives:\nWe want f(x, y) such that (1) fx = 4x2 + 8xy, (2) fy = 3y2 + 4x2 .\nTaking antiderivative of (1) w.r.t. x (treating y as a constant), we get f(x, y) = 3\n4 x3 + 4x2y+\nintegration constant (independent of x). The integration constant still depends on y, call it g(y).\nSo f(x, y) = 4\n3 x3 + 4x2y + g(y). Take partial w.r.t. y, to get fy = 4x2 + g0(y).\nComparing this with (2), we get g0(y) = 3y2, so g(y) = y3 + c.\nPlugging into above formula for f, we finally get f(x, y) = 3\n4 x3 + 4x2y + y3 + c.\nCurl.\nNow we have: Nx = My ⇔ ∗ F~ is a gradient field ⇔ F~ is conservative:\nC F~ · d~r = 0 for any\nclosed curve.\n(*):\nonly holds if F~ is defined everywhere, or in a \"simply-connected\" region - see next week.\n⇒\nFailure of conservativeness is given by the curl of F~:\nDefinition: curl( F~) = Nx - My.\nInterpretation of curl: for a velocity field, curl = (twice) angular velocity of the rotation\ncomponent of the motion.\n\nRR\nH\nRR\nR\nR\n(Ex: F~ = ha, bi uniform translation, F~ = hx, yi expanding motion have curl zero; whereas\nF~ = h-y, xi rotation at unit angular velocity has curl = 2).\nFor a force field, curl F~ = torque exerted on a test mass, measures how F~ imparts rotation motion.\nForce\nd\nFor translation motion:\n= acceleration =\n(velocity).\nMass\ndt\nTorque\nd\nFor rotation effects:\n= angular acceleration =\n(angular velocity).\nMoment of inertia\ndt\n18.02 Lecture 22.\n- Thu, Nov 1, 2007\nHandouts: PS8 solutions, PS9, practice exams 3A and 3B.\nGreen's theorem.\nIf C is a positively oriented closed curve enclosing a region R, then\nI\nZZ\nI\nZZ\nF~\nr =\nF dA\nM dx + N dy =\n(Nx - My\nd~\ncurl ~\nwhich means\n) dA.\n·\nC\nR\nC\nR\nExample (reduce a complicated line integral to an easy\n):\nLet C = unit circle centered at (2,0), counterclockwise.

For the vector field on\nPS8 Problem 2, we can't do this if the region contains the origin - for example, the line integral\nalong the unit circle is non-zero even though curl( F~) is zero wherever it's defined.\nProof of Green's theorem. 2 preliminary remarks:\nH\nRR\nH\nRR\n1) the theorem splits into two identities, C M dx = -\nR My dA and C N dy =\nNx dA.\nR\n2) additivity: if theorem is true for R1 and R2 then it's true for the union R = R1 ∪ R2 (picture\nH\nH\nH\nRR\nRR\nRR\nshown):\nC = C1 + C2 (the line integrals along inner portions cancel out) and\nR =\nR1 +\nR2 .\nMain step in the proof: prove\nM dx = -\nMy dA for \"vertically simple\" regions: a < x < b,\nC\nR\nf0(x) < y < f1(x).

The area of a region R can be evaluated using a line integral: for example,\nx dy =\nRR\nC\n1dA = area(R).\nR\nThis idea was used to build mechanical devices that measure area of arbitrary regions on a piece\nof paper: planimeters (photo of the actual object shown, and principle explained briefly: as one\nmoves its arm along a closed curve, the planimeter calculates the line integral of a suitable vector\nfield by means of an ingenious mechanism; at the end of the motion, one reads the area).\n18.02 Lecture 23.\n- Fri, Nov 2, 2007\nFlux. The flux of a vector field F~ across a plane curve C is C F~ nˆ ds, where nˆ = normal vector\n·\nto C, rotated 90* clockwise from Tˆ.\nWe now have two types of line integrals: work,\nF~\nTˆ ds, sums F~\nTˆ = component of F~ in\nR\n·\n·\ndirection of C, along the curve C. Flux,\nF~ nˆ ds, sums F~ nˆ = component of F~ perpendicular to\n·\n·\nC, along the curve.\nIf we break C into small pieces of length Δs, the flux is\ni(F~\nnˆ) Δsi.\n·\nPhysical interpretation: if F~ is a velocity field (e.g. flow of a fluid), flux measures how much\nmatter passes through C per unit time.\nLook at a small portion of C: locally F~ is constant, what passes through portion of C in unit\ntime is contents of a parallelogram with sides Δs and F~ (picture shown with F~ horizontal, and\nportion of curve = diagonal line segment). The area of this parallelogram is Δs height = Δs (F~ nˆ).\n·\n·\n(picture shown rotated with portion of C Rhorizontal, at base of parallelogram). Summing these\ncontributions along all of C, we get that\n(F~\nnˆ) ds is the total flow through C per unit time;\n·\ncounting positively what flows towards the right of C, negatively what flows towards the left of C,\nas seen from the point of view of a point travelling along C.\nExample: C = circle of radius a counterclockwise, F~ = xˆı + yˆj (picture shown): along C,\nF//nˆ, and |F | = a, so F~ · nˆZ = a. So\nZ\nF~\nnˆ ds =\na ds = a length(C) = 2πa2 .\n·\nC\nC\nMeanwhile, the flux of -yˆı + xˆj across C is zero (field tangent to C).\nThat was a geometric argument. What about the general situation when calculation of the line\nintegral is required?\nObserve: d~r = Tˆ ds = hdx, dyi, and nˆ is Tˆ rotated 90* clockwise; so nˆ ds = hdy, -dxi.\nSo, if F~ = P ˆı + Qˆj (using new letters to make things look different; of course we could call the\ncomponents M and N), then\nF~ · nˆ ds =\nhP, Qi · hdy, -dxi =\nC\n-Q dx + P dy.\nC\nC\n\nR\nI\nZZ\nI\nI\nI\n\nZZ\n\nRR\n(or if F~ = hM, Ni, C -N dx + M dy).\nSo we can compute flux using the usual method, by expressing x, y, dx, dy in terms of a parameter\nvariable and substituting (no example given).\nGreen's theorem for flux.

If we translate C to a different position (not centered at origin) (picture shown)\nthen direct calculation of flux is harder, but total flux is still 2πa2 .\nPhysical interpretation: in an incompressible fluid flow, divergence measures source/sink den\nsity/rate, i.e. how much fluid is being added to the system per unit area and per unit time."

Still, we can apply Green's theorem to an annulus (picture shown\nof a curve C0 = unit circle counterclockwise + segment along x-axis + small circle around origin\nclockwise + back to the unit circle allong the x-axis, enclosing an annulus R0). Then Green applies\nH\nRR\nH\nR\nR\nand says C0 F~ · d~r =\nR0 0 dA = 0; but line integral simplifies to C0 = C - C2 , where C = unit\ncircle, C2 = small circle / origin; so line integral is actually the same on C and C2 (or any other\ncurve encircling the origin).\nReview for Exam 3.\n2 main objects: double integrals and line integrals. Must know how to set up and evaluate.\nDouble integrals: drawing picture of region, taking slices to set up the iterated integral.\nAlso in polar coordinates, with dA = r dr dθ (see e.g. Problem 2; not done)\nRemember: mass, centroid, moment of inertia.\ndx\nFor evaluation, need to know: usual basic integrals (e.g.\nx ); integration by substitution (e.g.\nZ 1\nZ 2\nt dt\ndu\n√\n1 + t2 =\nR 1 2√u , setting u = 1 + t2).

Here: R is widest at intersection of paraboloids, which is in plane z = 2; general method:\nfor which (x, y) is z on top surface > z on bottom surface? Answer: when 4 - x2 - y2 > x2 - y2 ,\ni.e. x2 + y < 2. So we integrate over a disk of radius\n√\n2 in the xy-plane.

(Tuesday, 7 points: 1+2+2+2)\nCookies, doughnuts, and croissants contain essentially the same ingredients (flour, sugar,\negg, butter) but in different proportions. For example, it takes 22 grams of flour to make a\ncookie, versus 40 g for a doughnut and 50 g for a croissant. The compositions of the various\npastries can be encoded in a 4 × 3 matrix,\n\nM =\n,\n\nwhere the entries in the i-th row represent the amounts of ingredient i (i = 1 for flour, 2 for\nsugar, 3 for egg, 4 for butter) required to make the various types of pastries.\na) Consider an assortment of x1 cookies, x2 doughnuts and x3 croissants, and form the\ncolumn vector\n\nx1\nX = x2 .\nx3\nWhat do the entries of the vector MX correspond to?\nb) Each of the four ingredients has a specific nutritional value: for example, 100 grams\nof flour contain 10 g of protein, 76 g of carbohydrates, and 1 g of fat. Proceeding similarly\nfor all four ingredients, we can build a 3 × 4 matrix,\n\n0.10\n0.13\nN = 0.76\n1.00\n0.01\n0 ,\n0.01\n0.10\n0.82\n\nwhere the entries in the i-th column represent the proportions of protein, carbohydrates and\nfat in ingredient i.\nGive a matrix formula for the total nutritional value of the assortment of pastries con\nsidered in (a). (Keep your answer in symbolic form, do not evaluate numerically.)\nc) Give a matrix formula expressing the numbers xi of pastries of each type which will\nadd up to y1 g of protein, y2 g of carbohydrates, and y3 g of fat. Express your answer in\nthe form X = AY , and give both a formula for A and numerical values for its entries (use\neither a calculator or Matlab; short directions for Matlab can be found on the course web\npage\nd) The recommended daily amounts of protein, carbohydrates and fat for a 2000 calorie\ndiet are 50, 300, and 65 grams respectively. If you wanted to follow those guidelines while\neating only cookies, doughnuts, and croissants, how many pastries of each type should you\neat daily? What is wrong with your answer?

(Friday, 6 points: 3+3)\nConsider the four points A : (2, 4, 0), B : (3, 1, 1), C : (1, 1, 3), D : (0, 5, 1). Find the\ndistance between the lines (AB) and (CD), i.e. the distance between the closest points on\nthese two lines, by using two different methods:\na) Find a pair of planes which are parallel to both lines, with the first plane containing the\nline (AB) and the second plane containing the line (CD).

(immediately, 8 points: 2+1+1+2+2)\nIn 3D computer graphics, one needs to represent 3-dimensional objects on a plane screen,\nby drawing a given point P at the place where the line from P to the eye meets the screen.\nSuppose that the screen is the yz-plane, and the eye is at E : (2, 0, 0).\na) At what point Q : (y, z) in the yz-plane should one represent the point P : (x0, y0, z0)?\n(Express y and z in terms of the coordinates of P . Assume that x0 < 2. Why is this\nassumption legitimate?)\nb) What does the image on the screen of a line segment in space look like? (Justify your\nanswer.)\nc) A line segment connects P0 : (-1, -3, 1) to P1 : (-2, 4, 6). What is drawn on the\nscreen?\nd) A bird leaves from P0 at time t = 0, and flies in a straight line at constant speed in\nsuch a way that it passes through P1 at time t = 1. What does the trajectory of the bird\n(for t ≥ 0) look like on the screen? Show that, as t tends to infinity, the trajectory on the\nscreen tends to a limit point (the \"vanishing point\"), and give its coordinates.\ne) In fact, part of the trajectory of the bird is hidden by a vertical fence erected in front\nof the observer. The fence lies in the plane x = 1, and its top is at the altitude z = 1. What\nportion of the trajectory is hidden?\nHint: observe that the points hidden by the fence are exactly those which lie below a\ncertain plane passing through E.\nProblem 2.

Look ahead\nat the definition of gradient in 13.8 (top of p. 910) to know what it is before you do them.\nPart B\n(25 points)\nDirections: Attempt to solve each part of each problem yourself. If you collaborate,\nsolutions must be written up independently. It is illegal to consult materials from previous\nsemesters. With each problem is the day it can be done.\nWrite the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you collaborated and the\nresources you used.\nProblem 1. (Thursday, 11 points: 2+0+3+2+3+1) - Least squares and data analysis.\nParts (b)-(f) of this problem involve the use of Matlab. You may optionally use any\nother software with similar features, or even a calculator. In that case, indicate what you\nused, and describe how you proceeded. You must carry out the actual calculations rather\nthan rely on the statistical functions that may be built into the software you are using.\na) Before going to the terminal, read Notes LS and do the following. Consider the row\nvectors x = [x1 x2 . . . xn], y = [y1 y2 . . . yn] and u = [1 1 . . . 1] (n ones). Let y = ax + b\nbe the best-fitting line for the n points (xi, yi). Translate the formula (4) in LS into a single\n2 × 2 matrix equation\na\nAz = r,\nz =\nb\nWrite the entries of A and r in Matlab-ready form. Don't use summations, instead use, for\n′\nP\nexample, x ∗ u for\nxi. You will be able to confirm that your formulas are correct by\ntesting them on a concrete example using Matlab in part (c).\nb) The worldwide sales of iPods (in million units) for each year from 2001 to 2005 are\ngiven below (sources: Wikipedia, Apple quarterly reports):\n\nYears (xi)\n'01\n'02\n'03\n'04\n'05\nSales (yi)\n0.125\n0.470\n1.451\n8.263\n31.960\n(To make the numerical answers easier to read, we take the variable x to be the year\nminus 2000, so xi ranges from 1 to 5 for the given data points).\nLook at the Matlab directions for plotting at the end of this problem set and make a\nscatter plot of these data points marked with ∗'s. (Nothing to hand in; you will do this over\nagain with part (d).)\nc) Use Matlab, the data from (b) and the formulas you found in part (a) to find the best\nline y = ax + b fitted to the points. Compute the difference between the actual value of the\ndata y and the predicted value y = ax + b. Report a, b, and the worst case (largest error).\n(Optional, but recommended: check that your answer for a and b agrees with the Matlab\noperation polyfit(x,y,1), which computes the coefficients of the best polynomial of degree 1\nfitting the data x and y. If c = polyfit(x, y, 1) then c = [a, b] is the transpose of the column\nvector z in part (a). In this way you can confirm that you did part (a) correctly.)\nd) When a new product is launched, in the initial period the sales tend to grow expo\nnentially rather than linearly. Use Matlab to find the best fit of the form ln(y) = a1x + b1.\n(Note: Matlab uses the notation log for natural log, and log10 for log in base 10. So, in\nMatlab notation, you will be using log(y).) Report your values of a1, b1.\nIf you exponentiate this equation, you get\nb1 a1x\ny = e e\nCompute the difference between y and the predicted value according to this formula and\nreport the worst case (largest error).\ne) Hand in a printout that shows on the same plot: the scatter plot of (x, y) labelled with\n∗'s, the straight line fit, (x, ax + b) as a dashed line, and the curve (x, eb1 ea1x), connected\nby an ordinary line.\nf) According to the exponential best fit, how many iPods were sold in 2006? how many\nwill be sold in 2015? (for comparison, the total world population is about 6.6 billions). In\nfact, the growth is no longer exponential: \"only\" 46.4 million iPods were sold in 2006.\nProblem 2. (Friday, 8 points: 2+2+2+2)\nConsider a triangle inscribed in the unit circle in the plane, with one vertex at (1, 0) and\nthe two other vertices given by polar angles θ1 and θ2, in that order counterclockwise.\na) Express the area A of the triangle in terms of θ1 and θ2. What is the set of possible\nvalues for θ1 and θ2?\nb) Find the critical points of the function A in this region.\nc) By computing the values of A at the critical points and its behavior on the boundary\nof the region where it is defined, find the maximum and the minimum of A (justify your\nanswer). Describe the shapes of the triangles corresponding to these two situations.\nd) Use the second derivative test to confirm the nature of the critical points you found\nin (b).\n\np\nProblem 3. (Tuesday, 6 points: 1+2+2+1) (see also 2E/5)\na) Let w = f(x, y), and suppose we change from rectangular to polar coordinates:\nx = r cos θ, y = r sin θ. Using the chain rule, derive the change of variables formula in\nmatrix form:\n\nwr\nwx\n= A\n,\nwθ\nwy\nwriting the entries of the 2 × 2 matrix A as functions of r and θ.\nb) Use the formulas r =\nx2 + y2 , θ = tan-1 y/x to similarly derive the converse\nformula:\n\nwx\nwr\n= B\n,\nwy\nwθ\nwriting the entries of the 2 × 2 matrix B as functions of x and y.\nc) Check that B = A-1 by computing the product A B and changing variables.\nd) If wr = 2 and wθ = 10 at the point of polar coordinates r = 5, θ = π/2, compute wx\nand wy at the same point.\n\nMatlab Directions\nYou can reach Matlab in MIT Server by clicking on the main menu (lower left icon with\nthe footprint), then Math/Plotting, then Matlab.\nBe patient - it takes Matlab several seconds to load. Wait for the prompt symbol: >>.\nYou can leave Matlab by typing exit [return], or by closing the window. Matlab calculates\nwith matrices and vectors and draws graphs in 2D and 3D. Skip the Introduction and Help\ndocuments; as preliminary practice, just read and carry out the following.\nEntering matrices and vectors. In Matlab the variables represent matrices and vectors.\nThe symbol = assigns the value on the right side of the equation to the symbol on the left.\nType each of these lines in order, and see what you get. (Always hit [return] to end a line\nor command.)\nA = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]\n(you can use commas instead of spaces: 1,2,3;)\nb = [5 2 1]\nb'\n(transpose: gives the column vector which Matlab calls [5;2;1])\nTry making a mistake: C = [1,2,3; 4,5]. To edit the mistake, press any of the four arrow\nkeys to get the line back. (You can also prepare your commands in a text editor and copy\nthem with the mouse onto the Matlab command line.)\nOperations with matrices and vectors\nSum, difference\nA+B, A-B\n(matrices must be same size)\nProduct\nA*B\n(matrices must be compatibly sized)\nPowers\nA^n\n(A times itself n times; A must be square)\nTranspose\nA'\nInverse\ninv(A) (or A^-1)\nTry typing (use the values of A and b above): A*b\nA*b'\nb*A\nArray operations.\nRecall that * and ^ are product and power operations for matri\nces. Adding a dot before * or ^ makes these operations act component-wise. So, if x =\n[x1 x2 . . . xn], then\nexp(x) = [exp(x1) . . . exp(xn)] (similarly with sin, cos, log, etc.)\nx+y = [x1 + y1 . . . xn + yn] (similarly with -)\nx.*y = [x1y1 . . . xnyn]\nm\nm\nx.^m = [x1\n. . . xn ]\n(m can be zero)\nColon operator. This generates a vector with equally spaced entries; for example,\n[0 : 2 : 12] = [0 2 4 6 8 10 12];\n[2 : -.1 : 1.6] = [2.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6]\nTwo-dimensional plots in Matlab. Given x = [x1 x2 . . . xn], y = [y1 . . . yn] ,\nplot(x, y)\nplots the n points (xi, yi), joined by solid line segments.\nplot(x, y, ′ -- ′ )\nplots the n points, joined by dashed line segments.\n′\nplot(x, y, ∗ ′ )\nplots the n points as individual stars (or dots or circles, etc).\nprint gives a print-out of the current screen plot.\nTry in order (press [return] after each command):\nx=[0:.1:2]\nplot(x,sin(x))\nplot(x,4*x.^3)\n(this plots y = 4x3; note the need for the array operator)\nYou can also combine two plot commands: for example,\nplot(x,sin(x),'*',x,cos(x),'--')"

Use the method of Lagrange multipliers\nto write down the system of equations satisfied by the point closest to (2, -1, 1) at which\nx2 + yz = 2. (Hint: it is easier to minimize the square of the distance).\nb) Solve the equations to get a numerical approximation to four decimal places for the\nlocation of the point. Compare your answers with the approximation in 2(b). Was each\ncoordinate of the approximate answer in 2(b) within 1/100 of the exact answer?\nSuggestion: by considering the sum of the second and third equations, show that either\nz = -y or λ = 2. Assuming z = -y, use the multiplier equations to express x, y, z in\nterms of λ, then substitute these formulas into the constraint equation. After clearing the\ndenominator, you should obtain a degree 4 equation for λ. Use a calculator to solve it.\nAlternatively, in Matlab, roots([a4, a3, a2, a1, a0]) finds the roots of the polynomial a4λ4 +\na3λ3 + a2λ2 + a1λ + a0 = 0. (There should be two real roots). Finally, check that the other\ncase λ = 2 yields solutions (x, y, z) that are further away from (2, -1, 1)."

Changing Variables\nin Multiple Integrals\n1. Changing variables.\nDouble integrals in x, y coordinates which are taken over circular regions, or have inte-\ngrands involving the combination x2 + y2, are often better done in polar coordinates:\nThis involves introducing the new variables r and 19, together with the equations relating\nthem to x, y in both the forward and backward directions:\nChanging the integral to polar coordinates then requires three steps:\nA. Changing the integrand f (x, y) to g(r, 8), by using (2);\nB. Supplying the area element in the r, I9 system: dA = r dr dB ;\nC. Using the region R to determine the limits of integration in the r, I9 system.\nIn the same way, double integrals involving other types of regions or integrands can\nsometimes be simplified by changing the coordinate system from x, y to one better adapted\nto the region or integrand. Let's call the new coordinates u and v; then there will be\nequations introducing the new coordinates, going in both directions:\n(often one will only get or use the equations in one of these directions). To change the\nintegral to u,v-coordinates, we then have to carry out the three steps A, B, C above. A\nfirst step is to picture the new coordinate system; for this we use the same idea as for polar\ncoordinates, namely, we consider the grid formed by the level curves of the new coordinate\nfunctions:\nI\n\\\n,u=Uo\n(4)\nu(x, y) = UO,\nv(x,y) = vo .\nOnce we have this, algebraic and geometric intuition will usually handle\nsteps A and C , but for B we will need a formula: it uses a determinant\ncalled the Jacobian, whose notation and definition are\nv=v2\nUsing it, the formula for the area element in the u, v-system is\n\n18.02 NOTES\nso the change of variable formula is\nwhere g(u, v) is obtained from f (x, y) by substitution, using the equations (3).\nWe will derive the formula (5) for the new area element in the next section; for now let's\ncheck that it works for polar coordinates.\nExample 1. Verify (1) using the general formulas (5) and (6)\nSolution. Using (2), we calculate:\nso that dA = r dr dB, according to (5) and (6); note that we can omit the absolute value,\nsince by convention, in integration problems we always assume r 2 0, as is implied already\nby the equations (2).\nWe now work an example illustrating why the general formula is needed and how it is\nused; it illustrates step C also -putting in the new limits of integration.\nExample 2. Evaluate JJ,(.\ndx dy over the region R pictured.\n2)\nSolution. This would be a painful :\nintegral :\nto work out in rectangular coordinates.\nBut the region is bounded by the lines\nA I\nand the integrand also contains the combinations x -y and x +y. These powerfully suggest\nthat the integral will be simplified by the change of variable (we give it also in the inverse\ndirection, by solving the first pair of equations for x and y):\nWe will also need the new area element; using (5) and (9) above. we get\nnote that it is the second pair of equations in (9) that were used, not the ones introducing\nu and v. Thus the new area element is (this time we do need the absolute value sign in (6))\nWe now combine steps A and B to get the new double integral; substituting into the\nintegrand by using the first pair of equations in (9), we get\n\nCV. CHANGING VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE INTEGRALS\nIn uv-coordinates, the boundaries (8) of the region are simply u = f1, v = f1, so the\nintegral (12) becomes\ndudu =\ndudu\nWe have\nLA(&)\nv2\ninner integral =\nouter integral =\n2. The area element.\nIn polar coordinates, we found the formula dA = r dr dB for the area element by\ndrawing the grid curves r = ro and 6' = Bo for the r,6'-system, and determining (see\nthe picture) the infinitesimal area of one of the little elements of the grid.\nFor general u,v-coordinates, we do the same thing. The grid curves (4) divide up the\nplane into small regions AA bounded by these contour curves. If the contour curves are close\ntogether, they will be approximately parallel, so that the grid element will be approximately\na small parallelogram, and\nY\n(13)\nAA E area of parallelogram PQRS = IPQ x PRI\nv=v 0 +Av\nIn the uv-system, the points P, Q, R have the coordinates\nRG\nv=v0\nU=UO+AU\nP:(uo,vo),\nQ : ( u ~ + A u , v o ) ,\nR:(uo,vo+Av);\nP\nu=uo\nto use the cross-product however in (13), we need PQ and PR in i j - coordinates.\nConsider PQ first; we have\n(14)\nP Q = Axi + A y j ,\nwhere Ax and Ay are the changes in x and y as you hold v = vo and change uo to uo +Au.\nAccording to the definition of partial derivative,\nso that by (14),\nIn the same way, since in moving from P to R we hold u fixed and increase vo by Av,\nWe now use (13); since the vectors are in the xy-plane, P Q x P R has only a k -component,\nand we calculate from (15) and (16) that\n\n18.02 NOTES\nwhere we have first taken the transpose of the determinant (which doesn't change its value),\nand then factored the Au and Av out of the two columns. Finally, taking the absolute\nvalue, we get from (13) and (17), and the definition (5) of Jacobian,\npassing to the limit as Au, Av + 0 and dropping the subscript 0 (so that P becomes any\npoint in the plane), we get the desired formula for the area element,\n3. Examples and comments; putting in limits.\nIf we write the change of variable formula as\n(18)\nwhere\nit looks as if the essential equations we need are the inverse equations:\nrather than the direct equations we are usually given:\nIf it is awkward to get (20) by solving (21) simultaneously for x and y in terms of u and v,\nsometimes one can avoid having to do this by using the following relation (whose proof is\nan application of the chain rule, and left for the Exercises):\nThe right-hand Jacobian is easy to calculate if you know u(x, y) and v(x, y); then the left-\nhand one - the one needed in (19) - will be its reciprocal. Unfortunately, it will be in\nterms of x and y instead of u and v, so (20) still ought to be needed, but sometime\ngets lucky. The next example illustrates.\nExample 3. Evaluate\ndxdy, where R is the region pictured, having\nx\nas boundaries the curves x2 - y2 = 1, x2 - y2 = 4,\ny = 0,\ny = x/2 .\nSolution. Since the boundaries of the region are contour curves of x2 - y2 and y/x ,\nand the integrand is ylx, this suggests making the change of variable\n\nCV. CHANGING VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE INTEGRALS\nWe will try to get through without solving these backwards for x, y in terms of u, v. Since\nchanging the integrand to the u, v variables will give no trouble, the question is whether we\ncan get the Jacobian in terms of u and v easily. It all works out, using (22):\naccording to (22). We use now (18), put in the limits, and evaluate; note that the answer is\npositive, as it should be, since the integrand is positive.\nPutting in the limits\nIn the examples worked out so far, we had no trouble finding the limits of integration,\nsince the region R was bounded by contour curves of u and v, which meant that the limits\nwere constants.\nIf the region is not bounded by contour curves, maybe you should use a different change of\nvariables, but if this isn't possible, you'll have to figure out the uv-equations of the boundary\ncurves. The two examples below illustrate.\nExample 4. Let u = x + y, v = x - y; change l1 lx\ndy dx to an iterated integral\ndu dv.\nSolution. Using (19) and (22), we calculate -\na(x'\n= -112, so the Jacobian factor\n~ [ U . V )\n.\n,\nin the area element will be 112.\nI\nTo put in the new limits, we sketch the region of integration, as shown at the\nright. The diagonal boundary is the contour curve v = 0; the horizontal and vertical\nboundaries are not contour curves -what are their uv-equations? There are two\nways to answer this; the first is more widely applicable, but requires a separate\ncalculation for each boundary curve.\nMethod 1 Eliminate x and y from the three simultaneous equations u = u(x, y), v = v(x, y),\nand the xy-equation of the boundary curve. For the x-axis and x = 1, this gives\nMethod 2 Solve for x and y in terms of u, v; then substitute x = x(u, v), y = y(u, v) into\nthe xy-equation of the curve.\nUsing this method, we get x = $(u+v), y = i(u-v); substituting into the xy-equations:\n\n18.02 NOTES\nTo supply the limits for the integration order JJ du dv, we\n1. first hold v fixed, let u increase; this gives us the dashed lines shown;\n2. integrate with respect to u from the u-value where a dashed line enters\nR (namely, u = v), to the u-value where it leaves (namely, u = 2 - v).\n3.\nintegrate with respect to v from the lowest v-values for which the\ndashed lines intersect the region 1' 12-'\nR (namely, v = 0), to the highest such v-\nvalue (namely, v = 1).\nI\nI\nu=v\nTherefore the integral is\ndu dv .\n(As a check, evaluate it, and confirm that its value is the area of R. Then try setting up\nthe iterated integral in the order dv du; you'll have to break it into two parts.)\nExample 5 .\nUsing the change of coordinates u = x2 - y2, v = y/x of Example\n3, supply limits and integrand for /L\n, where R is the infinite region in the first\nquadrant under y = l/x and to the right of x2 - y2 = 1.\nSolution. We have to change the integrand, supply the Jacobian factor, and put in the\nright limits.\nTo change the integrand, we want to express x2 in terms of u and v; this suggests\neliminating y from the u, v equations; we get\nFrom Example 3, we know that the Jacobian factor is\nsince in the region R we\n2(1 - v2')'\nhave by inspection 0 5 v < 1, the Jacobian factor is always pos;tive and we don't need the\nabsolute value sign. So by (18) our integral becomes\nFinally, we have to put in the limits. The x-axis and the left-hand boundary curve\nx2 - Y2 = 1 are respectively the contour curves v = 0 and u = 1;our problem is the upper\nboundary curve xy = 1. To change this to u - v coordinates, we follow Method 1:\nThe form of this upper limit suggests that we should integrate first with\nrespect to u. Therefore we hold v fixed, and let u increase; this gives the\ndashed ray shown in the picture; we integrate from where it enters R at\nu = 1 to where it leaves, at u = - - v.\nv\nThe rays we use are those intersecting R: they start from the lowest ray, corresponding\nto v = 0, and go to the ray v = a, where a is the slope of OP. Thus our integral is\n\nCV. CHANGING VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE INTEGRALS\nTo complete the work, we should determine a explicitly. This can be done by solving\nxy = 1 and x2 - Y2 = 1 simultaneously to find the coordinates of P. A more elegant\napproach is to add y = ax (representing the line OP) to the list of equations, and solve all\nthree simultaneously for the slope a. We substitute y = ax into the other two equations,\nand get\nax2 = 1\n-1 +\n+\nd5\na = 1 - a 2\n+\na =\nx2(1- a2) = 1\n'\nby the quadratic formula.\n4. Changing coordinates in triple integrals\nHere the coordinate change will involve three functions\nbut the general principles remain the same. The new coordinates u, v, and w give a three-\ndimensional grid, made up of the three families of contour surfaces of u, v, and w. Limits\nare put in by the kind of reasoning we used for double integrals. What we still need is the\nformula for the new volume element dV.\nTo get the volume of the little six-sided region AV of space bounded by three pairs of\nthese contour surfaces, we note that nearby contour surfaces are approximately parallel,\nso that AV is approximately a parallelepiped, whose volume is (up to sign) the 3 x 3\ndeterminant whose rows are the vectors forming the three edges of AV meeting at a corner.\nThese vectors are calculated as in section 2; after passing to the limit we get\ndV = la(x'y'Z) dudvdw ,\n~ ( ' L L ,\nv, W)\nI\nwhere the key factor is the Jacobian\nAs an example, you can verify that this gives the correct volume element for the change\nfrom rectangular to spherical coordinates:\nwhile this is a good exercise, it will make you realize why most people prefer to derive the\nvolume element in spherical coordinates by geometric reasoning.\nExercises: Section 3D"

This is what the common software packages and the literature use. The\ndeterminants of order two and three would be written respectively\nis another form for this rule which requires adding two extra columns to the determinant, but\nthis wastes too much time in practice and leads to awkward write-ups; instead, learn to evaluate each of\nthe six products mentally, writing it down with the correct sign, and then add the six numbers, as is done\nin Example 1. Note that the word \"determinant\" is also used for the square array itself, enclosed between\ntwo vertical lines, as for example when one speaks of \"the second row of the determinant\".\n\n18.02 NOTES\nIn general, the ij-entry, written aij, is the number in the i-th row and j-th column.\nIts ij-minor, written IAij 1, is the determinant that's left after deleting from IAl the row\nand column containing aij.\nIts ij-cofactor, written here Aij ,is given as a formula by Aij = (- l)j+j lAij 1.

Gravitational Attraction\nWe use triple integration to calculate the gravitational attraction that a solid body V of\nmass M exerts on a unit point mass placed at the origin.\nIf the solid V is also a point mass, then according to Newton's law of gravitation, the\nforce it exerts is given by\nwhere R is the position vector from the origin 0 to the point V, and the\nd\nunit vector r = R/IRI is its direction.\nIf however the solid body V is not a point mass, we have to use integration. We concen-\ntrate on finding just the k component of the gravitational attraction - all our examples\nwill have the solid body V placed symmetrically so that its pull is all in the k direction\nanyway.\nTo calculate this force, we divide up the solid V into small pieces having volume AV and\nmass Am. If the density function is S(x, y,z), we have for the piece containing the point\n(5,Y, z)\nThinking of this small piece as being essentially a point mass at (x, y, z), the force A F it\nexerts on the unit mass at the origin is given by (I.), and its k component AF, is therefore\nAm\nAF, = G T r .\nk ,\nIRI\nwhich in spherical coordinates becomes, using (2), and the picture,\ncos 4\nSAV\nAF, = G-\nSAV = G-\ncos 4 .\np2\np2\nIf we sum all the contributions to the force from each of the mass elements Am and pass to\nthe limit, we get for the k-component of the gravitational force\ncos 4\nF, = G / / ' p 2 s d ~ .\nIf the integral is in spherical coordinates, then dV = p2sin4dpd4d0, and the integral\nbecomes\n\nG.

To take advantage of the symmetry, place the origin at the center of the\nsphere, and align the axis of the cap along the z-axis (so the flat side of the cap is parallel\nto the xy-plane) .\nWe use spherical coordinates; the main problem is determining the limits of integration.\nIf we fix $ and 8 and let p vary, we get a ray which enters V at its flat side\nand leaves V on its spherical side, p = afi.

Limits in Iterated Integrals\nFor most students, the trickiest part of evaluating multiple integrals by iteration is to\nput in the limits of integration. Fortunately, a fairly uniform procedure is available which\nworks in any coordinate system. You must always begin by sketching the region; in what\nfollows we'll assume you've done this.\n'\n1. Double integrals in rectangular coordinates.\nLet's illustrate this procedure on the first case that's usually\ntaken up: double integrals in rectangular coordinates. Suppose we\nwant to evaluate over the region R pictured the integral\nR = region between x2 + y2 = 1 and x +y = 1 ;\nwe are integrating first with respect to y. Then to put in the limits,\n1. Hold x fixed, and let y increase (since we are integrating with respect to y).\nAs the point (x, y) moves, it traces out a vertical line.\n2. Integrate from the y-value where this vertical line enters the region R, to\nthe y-value where it leaves R.\n3. Then let x increase, integrating from the lowest x-value for which the vertical\nline intersects R, to the highest such x-value.\nCarrying out this program for the region R pictured, the vertical line enters R where\ny = 1- x, and leaves where y = d m .\nI\nA\nThe vertical lines which intersect R are those between x = 0 and\nx = 1. Thus we get for the limits:\nJJ,f(x,Y) dydx =\nTo calculate the double integral, integrating in the reverse order J&f (x, y) dx dy,\n1. Hold y fixed, let x increase (since we are integrating first with respect to x).\nThis traces out a horizontal line.\n2. Integrate from the x-value where the horizontal line enters R to the x-value\nwhere it leaves.\n3. Choose the y-limits to include all of the horizontal lines which intersect R.\nFollowing this prescription with our integral we get:\nx=l-y\nJJ,f(x, Y) dx dy =\nExercises: 3A-2\n\n18.02 NOTES\n2. Double integrals in polar coordinates\nThe same procedure for putting in the limits works for these integrals also. Suppose we\nwant to evaluate over the same region R as before\nAs usual, we integrate first with respect to r. Therefore, we\n. 1. Hold B fixed, and let r increase (since we are integrating with respect to r).\nAs the point moves, it traces out a ray going out from the origin.\n2. Integrate from the r-value where the ray enters R to the r-value where it\nleaves. This gives the limits on r.\n3. Integrate from the lowest value of 8 for which the corresponding ray inter-\nsects R to the highest value of 8.\nTo follow this procedure, we need the equation of the line in polar coordinates. We have\nx + y = l\n+\nr c o s e + r s i n B = l ,\nor r = cose + sine'\nThis is the r value where the ray enters the region; it leaves where\nr = 1. The rays which intersect R lie between B = 0 and B = ~ / 2 .\nThus the double iterated integral in polar coordinates has the limits p&]\nLm'2\ndr dB .\nr = l/(cose+ sine)\nL ; ( m se+sin e)\nExercises: 3B-1\n3. Triple integrals in rectangular and cylindrical coordinates.\nYou do these the same way, basically. To supply limits for J& dz dy dx over\nthe region D, we integrate first with respect to z. Therefore we\n1. Hold x and y fixed, and let z increase. This gives us a vertical line.\n2. Integrate from the z-value where the vertical line enters the region D to the\nz-value where it leaves D.\n3. Supply the remaining limits (in either xy-coordinates or polar coordinates)\nso that you include all vertical lines which intersect D. This means that you will\nbe integrating the remaining double integral over the region R in the xy-plane\nwhich D projects onto.\nFor example, if D is the region lying between the two paraboloids\n.. . . .. .\nz = x 2 + y 2\nz = 4 - x 2 -y2,\nwe get by following steps 1and 2,\n\nI. LIMITS IN ITERATED INTEGRALS\nwhere R is the projection of D onto the xy-plane. To finish the job, we have to determine\nwhat this projection is. From the picture, what we should determine is the xy-curve over\nwhich the two surfaces intersect. We find this curve by eliminating z from the two equations,\ngetting\nx2 + y2 = 4 - x2 - Y2,\nwhich implies\nx2 + Y2 = 2.\nThus the xy-curve bounding R is the circle in the xy-plane with center at the origin and\nradius fi .\nThis makes it natural to finish the integral in polar coordinates. We get\nthe limits on z will be replaced by r2 and 4 - r2 when the integration is carried out.\nExercises: 5A-2\n4. Spherical coordinates.\nOnce again, we use the same procedure. To calculate the limits for\nan iterated integral J& dpd4d6 over a region D in bspace, we are\nintegrating first with respect to p. Therefore we\n1. Hold 4 and 6 fixed, and let p increase. This gives us a ray going out from\n,\nthe origin.\n2. Integrate from the p-value where the ray enters D to the p-value where the\nray leaves D. This gives the limits on p.\n3. Hold 6 fixed and let 4 increase. This gives a family of rays, that form a sort\nof fan. Integrate over those &values for which the rays intersect the region D.\n4. Finally, supply limits on 6 so as to include all of the fans which intersect the\nregion D.\nFor example, suppose we start with the circle in the yz-plane of radius 1 and center at\n(l,O), rotate it about the z-axis, and take D to be that part of the resulting solid lying in\nthe first octant.\nFirst of all, we have to determine the equation of the surface formed\nby the rotated circle. In the yz-plane, the two coordinates p and 4 are\nindicated. To see the relation between them when P is on the circle, we see\nthat also angle OAP = 4, since both the angle 4 and OAP are complements\nof the same angle, AOP. From the right triangle, this shows the relation is\np = 2 sin 4.\nAs the circle is rotated around the z-axis, the relationship stays the same, so p = 2 sin 4\nis the equation of the whole surface.\nTo determine the limits of integration, when 4 and 6 are fixed, the correpsonding ray\nenters the region where p = 0 and leaves where p = 2 sin 4.\nAs 4 increases, with 6 fixed, it is the rays between 4 = 0 and 4 = r / 2 that intersect D,\nsince we are only considering the portion of the surface lying in the first octant (and thus\nabove the xy-plane).\n\n18.02 NOTES\nAgain, since we only want the part in the first octant, we only use 9 values from 0 to\n1~12.So the iterated integral is\nExercises: 5B-1"

Kepler's Second Law\nBy studying the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's data about the motion of the planets,\nKepler formulated three empirical laws; two of them can be stated as follows:\nSecond Law A planet moves in a plane, and the radius vector (from the sun to the\nplanet) sweeps out equal areas in equal times.\nFirst Law The planet's orbit in that plane is an ellipse, wi.th the sun at one focus.\nFrom these laws, Newton deduced that the force keeping the planets in their orbits had\nmagnitude l/d2, where d was the distance to the sun; moreover, it was directed toward the\nsun, or as was said, central, since the sun was placed at the origin.\nUsing a little vector analysis (without coordinates), this section is devoted to showing\nthat the Second Law is equivalent to the force being central.\nIt is harder to show that an elliptical orbit implies the magnitude of the force\nis of the form K/d2, and vice-versa; this uses vector analysis in polar coordinates\nand requires the solution of non-linear differential equations.\n1. Differentiation of products of vectors\nLet r(t) and s(t) be two differentiable vector functions in 2- or 3-space. Then\nThese rules are just like the product rule for differentiation. Be careful in the second\nrule to get the multiplication order correct on the right, since a x b # b x a in general.\nThe two rules can be proved by writing everything out in terms of i ,j ,k components and\ndifferentiating. They can also be proved directly from the definition of derivative, without\nresorting to components, as follows:\nLet t increase by At. Then r increases by Ar, and s by As, and the corresponding change\nin r . s is given by\nA ( r - s ) = ( r + A r ) . ( s + A s ) - r . s ,\nso if we expand the right side out and divide all terms by At, we get\nNow let At + 0; then As + 0 since s(t) is continuous, and we get the first equation in (1).\nThe second equation in (1) is proved the same way, replacing . by x everywhere.\n2.\nKepler's second law and the central force. To show that the force being\ncentral (i.e., directed toward the sun) is equivalent to Kepler's second law, we need to\ntranslate that law into calculus. \"Sweeps out equal areas in equal times\" means:\nthe radius vector sweeps out area at a constant rate\n\n18.02 NOTES\nThe first thing therefore is to obtain a mathematical expression for this rate. Referring\nto the picture, we see that as the time increases from t to t + At, the corresponding change\nin the area A is given approximately by\n=\nAA\narea of the triangle = - Ir x Arl ,\nsince the triangle has half the area of the parallelogram formed by r and Ar; thus, \\\nand as At + 0, this becomes\nUsing (2), we can interpret Kepler's second law mathematically. Since the area is swept\nout at a constant rate, dA/dt is constant, so according to (2),\n(3)\nIr x vl\nis a constant.\nMoreover, since Kepler's law says r lies in a plane, the velocity vector v also lies in the same\nplane, and therefore\n(4)\nr x v has constant direction (perpendicular to the plane of motion).\nSince the direction and magnitude of r x v are both constant,\n(5)\nr x v = K, a constant vector,\nand from this we see that\nBut according to the rule (1) for differentiating a vector product,\nd\ndv\n- (r x V) = v x v + r x a,\nwhere a = -,\ndt\ndt\n= r x a ,\nsince s x s = 0 for any vector s.\nNow (6) and (7) together imply\nwhich shows that the acceleration vector a is parallel to r, but in the opposite direction,\nsince the planets do go around the sun, not shoot off to infinity.\nThus a is directed toward the center (i.e., the sun), and since F = ma, the force F is\nalso directed toward the sun. (Note that \"center\" does not mean the center of the elliptical\norbits, but the mathematical origin, i.e., the tail of the radius vector r , which we are taking\nto be the sun's position.)\nThe reasoning is reversible, so for motion under any type of central force, the path of\nmotion will lie in a plane and area will be swept out by the radius vector at a constant rate.\nExercises: Section 1K"

Least Squares Interpolation\n1. The least-squares line.\nSuppose you have a large number n of experimentally determined points, through which\nyou want to pass a curve. There is a formula (the Lagrange interpolation formula) producing\na polynomial curve of degree n -1which goes through the points exactly. But normally one\nwants to find a simple curve, like a line, parabola, or exponential, which goes approximately\nthrough the points, rather than a high-degree polynomial which goes exactly through them.\nThe reason is that the location of the points is to some extent determined by experimental\nerror, so one wants a smooth-looking curve which averages out these errors, not a wiggly\npolynomial which takes them seriously.\nIn this section, we consider the most common case -finding a line which\ngoes approximately through a set of data points.\nI\n.\nSuppose the data points are\nand we want to find the line\nwhich \"best\" passes through them. Assuming our errors in measurement are distributed\nrandomly according to the usual bell-shaped curve (the so-called \"Gaussian distribution\"),\nit can be shown that the right choice of a and b is the one for which the sum D of the\nsquares of the deviations\nI\ni= l\nis a minimum. In the formula (2), the quantities in parentheses (shown by\ndotted lines in the picture) are the deviations between the observed values -\nyi and the ones axi + b that would be predicted using the line (1).\nThe deviations are squared for theoretical reasons connected with the assumed Gaussian\nerror distribution; note however that the effect is to ensure that we sum only positive\nquantities; this is important, since we do not want deviations of opposite sign to cancel each\nother out. It also weights more heavily the larger deviations, keeping experimenters honest,\nsince they tend to ignore large deviations (\"I had a headache that day\").\nThis prescription for finding the line (1) is called the method of least squares, and the\nresulting line (1) is called the least-squares line or the regression line.\nTo calculate the values of a and b which make D a minimum, we see where the two partial\nderivatives are zero:\n\n18.02 NOTES\nThese give us a pair of linear equations for determining a and b, as we see by collecting\nterms and cancelling the 2's:\n(Notice that it saves a lot of work to differentiate (2) using the chain rule, rather than first\nexpanding out the squares.)\nThe equations (4) are usually divided by n to make them more expressive:\nwhere Z and are the average of the xi and yi, and % = C xp/n is the average of the squares.\nFrom this point on use linear algebra to determine a and b. It is a good exercise to see\nthat the equations are always solvable unless all the xi are the same (in which case the best\nline is vertical and can't be written in the form (1)).\nIn practice, least-squares lines are found by pressing a calculator button, or giving a\nMatLab command. Examples of calculating a least-squares line are in the exercises in your\nbook and these notes. Do them from scratch, starting from (2), since the purpose here is to\nget practice with max-min problems in several variables; don't plug into the equations (5).\nRemember to differentiate (2) using the chain rule; don't expand out the squares, which\nleads to messy algebra and highly probable error.\n2. Fitting curves by least squares.\nIf the experimental points seem to follow a curve rather than a line, it might make more\nsense to try to fit a second-degree polynomial\nto them. If there are only three points, we can do this exactly (by the Lagrange interpolation\nformula). For more points, however, we once again seek the values of ao,al, a2 for which\nthe sum of the squares of the deviations\nis a minimum. Now there are three unknowns, ao, al, a2. Calculating (remember to use the\nchain rule!) the three partial derivatives dD/dai, i = 0,1,2, and setting them equal to zero\nleads to a square system of three linear equations; the ai are the three unknowns, and the\ncoefficients depend on the data points (xi, yi). They can be solved by finding the inverse\nmatrix, elimination, or using a calculator or MatLab.\nIf the points seem to lie more and more along a line as x + m, but lie on one side of the\nline for low values of x, it might be reasonable to try a function which has similar behavior,\nlike\n\nLS. LEAST SQUARES INTERPOLATION\nand again minimize the sum of the squares of the deviations, as in (7). In general, this\nmethod of least squares applies to a trial expression of the form\nwhere the fi(x) are given functions (usually simple ones like 1,x, x2, l/x, ekx, etc. Such an\nexpression (9) is called a linear combination of the functions fi(x). The method produces\na square inhomogeneous system of linear equations in the unknowns ao,. . . ,a, which can\nbe solved by finding the inverse matrix to the system, or by elimination.\nThe method also applies to finding a linear function\nto fit a set of data points\nwhere there are two independent variables x and y and a dependent variable z (this is\nthe quantity being experimentally measured, for different values of (x, y)). This time after\ndifferentiation we get a 3 x 3 system of linear equations for determining all a2, a3 .\nThe essential point in all this is that the unknown coefficients ai should occur linearly\nin the trial function. Try fitting a function like cekx to data points by using least squares,\nand you'll see the difficulty right away. (Since this is an important problem - fitting an\nexponential to data points -one of the Exercises explains how to adapt the method to this\ntype of problem.)\nExercises: Section 2G"

Matrices and Linear Algebra\n1. Matrix algebra.\nIn section D we calculated the determinants of square arrays of numbers. Such arrays are\nimportant in mathematics and its applications; they are called matrices. In general, they\nneed not be square, only rectangular.\nA rectangular array of numbers having m rows and n columns is called an m x n matrix.\nThe number in the i-th row and j-th column (where 1 5 i 5 m, 1 5 j 5 n) is called the\nij-entry, and denoted aij; the matrix itself is denoted by A, or sometimes by (aij).\nTwo matrices of the same size are equal if corresponding entries are equal.\nTwo special kinds of matrices are the row-vectors: the 1 x n matrices (al, az, . . . ,a,);\nand the column vectors: the m x 1matrices consisting of a column of m numbers.\nFrom now on, row-vectors or column-vectors will be indicated by boldface small\nletters; when writing them by hand, put an arrow over the symbol.\nMatrix operations\nThere are four basic operations which produce new matrices from old.\n1. Scalar multiplication: Multiply each entry by c : cA = (caij)\n2.\nMatrix addition: Add the corresponding entries: A + B = (aij + bij); the two\nmatrices must have the same number of rows and the same number of columns.\n3. Transposition: The transpose of the m x n matrix A is the n x m matrix obtained by\nmaking the rows of A the columns of the new matrix. Common notations for the transpose\nare AT and A'; using the first we can write its definition as AT = (aji).\nIf the matrix A is square, you can think of AT as the matrix obtained by flipping A over\naround its main diagonal.\n2 -3\n\nExample 1.1 Let A =\n. FindA+B, AT, 2A-3B.\n\n18.02 NOTES\n4. Matrix multiplication This is the most important operation. Schematically, we have\nm x n\nn x p\nm x P\nThe essential points are:\n1. For the multiplication to be defined, A must have as many columns as B has rows;\n2. The ij-th entry of the product matrix C is the dot product of the i-th row of A with\nthe j-th column of B.\nThe two most important types of multiplication, for multivariable calculus and\ndifferential equations, are:\n1. AB, where A and B are two square matrices of the same size -these can\nalways be multiplied;\n2. Ab, where A is a square n x n matrix, and b is a column n-vector.\nLaws and properties of matrix multiplication\nM-1. A(B + C) = AB + AC,\n(A + B)C = AC + B C\ndistributive laws\nM-2. (AB)C = A(BC);\n(cA) B = c(AB).\nassociative laws\nIn both cases, the matrices must have compatible dimensions.\nM-3. Let I3=\n;\nthen AI = A and I A = A for any 3 x 3 matrix.\nI is called the identity matrix of order 3. There is an analogously defined square identity\nmatrix Inof any order n, obeying the same multiplication laws.\nM-4. In general, for two square n x n matrices A and B, AB # BA: matrix multiplication\nis not commutative. (There are a few important exceptions, but they are very special -for\nexample, the equality A I = IA where I is the identity matrix.)\nM-5. For two square n x n matrices A and B, we have the determinant law:\nlABl = IAIJBI,\nalso written\ndet(AB) = det(A)det(B)\nFor 2 x 2 matrices, this can be verified by direct calculation, but this naive method is\nunsuitable for larger matrices; it's better to use some theory. We will simply assume it in\nthese notes; we will also assume the other results above (of which only the associative law\nM-2 offers any difficulty in the proof).\n\nM. MATRICES AND LINEAR ALGEBRA\nM-6. A useful fact is this: matrix multiplication can be used to pick out a row or column\nof a given matrix: you multiply by a simple row or column vector to do this.

Solving square systems of linear equations; inverse matrices.\nLinear algebra is essentially about solving systems of linear equations, an important\napplication of mathematics to real-world problems in engineering, business, and science,\nespecially the social sciences. Here we will just stick to the most important case, where the\nsystem is square, i.e., there are as many variables as there are equations. In low dimensions\nsuch systems look as follows (we give a 2 x 2 system and a 3 x 3 system):\nIn these systems, the aij and bi are given, and we want to solve for the xi.\nAs a simple mathematical example, consider the linear change of coordinates given by\nthe equations\nIf we know the y-coordinates of a point, then these equations tell us its x-coordinates\nimmediately. But if instead we are given the x-coordinates, to find the y-coordinates we\nmust solve a system of equations like (7) above, with the yi as the unknowns.\nUsing matrix multiplication, we can abbreviate the system on the right in (7) by\nwhere A is the square matrix of coefficients (aij ). (The 2 x 2 system and the n x n system\nwould be written analogously; all of them are abbreviated by the same equation Ax = b,\nnotice.)\nYou have had experience with solving small systems like (7) by elimination: multiplying\nthe equations by constants and subtracting them from each other, the purpose being to\n\n18.02 NOTES\neliminate all the variables but one. When elimination is done systematically, it is an efficient\nmethod. Here however we want to talk about another method more compatible with hand-\nheld calculators and MatLab, and which leads more rapidly to certain key ideas and results\nin linear algebra.\nInverse matrices.\nReferring to the system (8), suppose we can find a square matrix M , the same size as A,\nsuch that\n(9)\nMA = I\n(the identity matrix).\nWe can then solve (8) by matrix multiplication, using the successive steps,\nwhere the step M(Ax) = x is justified by\nM(Ax) = (MA)x,\nby M-2;\n= I x ,\nby (9);\n= x,\nby M-3 .\nMoreover, the solution is unique, since (10) gives an explicit formula for it.\nThe same procedure solves the problem of determining the inverse to the linear change\nof coordinates x = Ay, as the next example illustrates.\nExample 2.1 Let A =\n2,\nVerify that M satisfies (9)\n(2 3) and M = (-32 -1\n'\nabove, and use it to solve the first system below for xi and the second for the yi in terms of\nthe xi:\nSolution.\nWe have ( 2 3) (-32 -12, = (i :), by matrix multiplication. To\nsolve the first system, we have by (lo), ( )\n= ( 2 -1 (3\n= (A:),\nso the\nsolution is x1 = 11,x2 = -6. By reasoning similar to that used above in going from Ax = b\nto x = Mb, the solution to x = Ay is y = Mx, so that we get\nas the expression for the yi in terms of the xi.\nOur problem now is: how do we get the matrix M? In practice, you mostly press a key\non the calculator, or type a Matlab command. But we need to be able to work abstractly\n\nM. MATRICES AND LINEAR ALGEBRA\nwith the matrix -i.e., with symbols, not just numbers, and for this some theoretical ideas\nare important. The first is that M doesn't always exist.\nM exists\nIAI # 0.\nThe implication + follows immediately from the law M-5, since\nThe implication in the other direction requires more; for the low-dimensional cases, we will\nproduce a formula for M. Let's go to the formal definition first, and give M its proper\nname, A-l:\nDefinition. Let A be an n x n matrix, with IAl # 0. Then the inverse of A is an n x n\nmatrix, written A-', such that\n(It is actually enough to verify either equation; the other follows automatically -see the\nexercises.)\nUsing the above notation, our previous reasoning (9) - (10) shows that\n(12)\nIAl # 0 + the unique solution of A x = b is x = A-'b;\n(12)\nJAl# 0 + the solution of x = A y for the yi is y = A-'x.\nCalculating the inverse of a 3 x 3 matrix\nLet A be the matrix. The formulas for its inverse A-' and for an auxiliary matrix adj A\ncalled the adjoint of A (or in some books the adjugate of A) are\nT\nAll A12\nA13\n(13)\nA-'\n= -\nI\nadj A = -\nAzl Azz\nA1\n1 (\nA\nA t::)\n'\nIn the formula, Aij is the cofactor of the element aij in the matrix, i.e., its minor with its\nsign changed by the checkerboard rule (see section 1on determinants).\nFormula (13) shows that the steps in calculating the inverse matrix are:\n1. Calculate the matrix of minors.\n2. Change the signs of the entries according to the checkerboard rule.\n3. 3-anspose the resulting matrix; this gives adj A.\n4. Divide every entry by IAl.\n(If inconvenient, for example if it would produce a matrix having fractions for every entry,\nyou can just leave the 1/IA( factor outside, as in the formula. Note that step 4 can only be\ntaken if IAl # 0, so if you haven't checked this before, you'll be reminded of it now.)\nThe notation Aij for a cofactor makes it look like a matrix, rather than a signed\ndeterminant; this isn't good, but we can live with it.\n\n18.02 NOTES\nExample 2.2 Find the inverse to A =\nSolution.

We do it for\na general matrix, since it will save you time in differential equations if you can learn the\nresulting formula.\nmatrix A\ncofactors\nT\nadj A\ninverse of A\n2 2\nExample 2.3 Find the inverses to:\n3 2\n\nSolution. a) Use the formula: IAI = 2, so A-' = -2 (-3\n1) = (4 $) .\nb) Follow the previous scheme:\nBoth solutions should be checked by multiplying the answer by the respective A.\nProof of formula (13) for the inverse matrix.\nWe want to show A. A-l = I , or equivalently, A . adj A = IAJI; when this last is written\nout using (13) (remembering to transpose the matrix on the right there), it becomes\nTo prove (14), it will be enough to look at two typical entries in the matrix on the right -\nsay the first two in the top row. According to the rule for multiplying the two matrices on\nthe left, what we have to show is that\n\nM. MATRICES AND LINEAR ALGEBRA\nThese two equations are both evaluating determinants by Laplace expansions: the first\nequation (15) evaluates the determinant on the left below by the cofactors of the first row;\nthe second equation (16) evaluates the determinant on the right below by the cofactors of\nthe second row (notice that the cofactors of the second row don't care what's actually in\nthe second row, since to calculate them you only need to know the other two rows).\nThe two equations (15) and (16) now follow, since the determinant on the left is just JAl,\nwhile the determinant on the right is 0, since two of its rows are the same.\nThe procedure we have given for calculating an inverse works for n x n matrices, but gets\nto be too cumbersome if n > 3, and other methods are used. The calculation of A-' for\nreasonable-sized A is a standard package in computer algebra programs and MatLab. Unfor-\ntunately, social scientists often want the inverses of very large matrices, and for this special\ntechniques have had to be devised, which produce approximate but acceptable results.\nExercises: Section 1G\n3. Cramer's rule (some 18.02 classes omit this)\nThe general square system and its solution may be written\nWhen this solution is written out and simplified, it becomes a rule for solving the system\nA x = b known as Cramer's rule. We illustrate with the 2 x 2 case first; the system is\nThe solution is, according to (17),\nIf we write out the answer using determinants, it becomes Crarner's rule:\nThe formulas in the 3 x 3 case are similar, and may be expressed this way:\nCrarner's rule. If IAI # 0, the solution of A x = b is given by\nl Ail\nxi = -\n1A.I '\nwhere lAil is the determinant obtained by replacing the i-th column of IA( by the column\nvector b.\n\n18.02 NOTES\nCramer's rule is particularly useful if one only wants one of the xi, as in the next example.\nExample 3.1. Solve for x, using Cramer's rule (19):\nSolution. We rewrite the system on the left below, then use Cramer's rule (19):\nI-:\n::I\n-7\nProof of (19). Since the solution to the system is x = A-'b, when we write it out\nexplicitly, it becomes\nAll\nA21\nA31\nA13\nA23\nA33\nWe show that this gives formula (19) for XI; the arguments for the other xi go similarly.\nFrom the definition of matrix multiplication, we get from the above\naccording to the Laplace expansion of the determinant by its first column. But this last\nequation is exactly Cramer's rule for finding xl.\nCramer's rule is also valid for n x n systems; it is not normally used for systems larger\nthan 3 x 3 however. You would use A-l, or systematic elimination of variables. Nonetheless,\nthe formula (19) is important as a theoretical tool in proofs and derivations.\nExercises: Section 1H\n4. Theorems about homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems.\nOn the basis of our work so far, we can formulate a few general results about square\nsystems of linear equations. They are the theorems most frequently referred to in the\napplications.\nDefinition. The linear system Ax = b is called homogeneous if b = 0; otherwise, it is\ncalled inhomogeneous.\n\nM. MATRICES AND LINEAR ALGEBRA\nTheorem 1. Let A be an n x n matrix.\n(20)\nIAl # 0\nA x = b has the unique solution, x = A-lb .\n(21)\nIAl # 0\nA x = 0 has only the trivial solution, x = 0.\nNotice that (21) is the special case of (20) where b = 0. Often it is stated and used in the\ncontrapositive form:\n(21')\nAx = 0 has a non-zero solution\n+-\nIAl = 0.\n(The contrapositive of a statement P +- Q is not-Q +- not-P; the two statements say\nthe same thing.)\nTheorem 2. Let A be an n x n matrix.\n(22)\nIAl = 0\n+-\nA X = 0 has non-trivial (i.e., non-zero) solutions.\n(23)\nIAl = 0\n+-\nA x = b usually has no solutions, but has solutions for some b.\nIn (23), we call the system consistent if it has solutions, inconsistent otherwise.\nThis probably seems like a maze of similar-sounding and confusing theorems. Let's get\nanother perspective on these ideas by seeing how they apply separately to homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous systems.\nHomogeneous systems: Ax = 0 has non-trivial solutions w IAl = 0.\nInhomogeneous systems: Ax = b has the unique solution x = A-lb, if (A1 # 0.\nIf IA( = 0, then A x = b usually has no solutions, but does have solutions for some b.\nThe statements (20) and (21) are proved, since we have a formula for the solution, and it\neasy to see by multiplying A x = b by A-I that if x is a solution, it must be of the form\n= A-'b.\nWe prove (22) just for the 3 x 3 case, by interpreting it geometrically. We will give a\npartial argument for (23), based on both algebra and geometry.\nProof of (22).\nWe represent the three rows of A by the row vectors a, b, c and we let x = (x,y,z);\nthink of all these as origin vectors, i.e., place their tails at the origin. Then, considering the\nhomogeneous system first,\n(24)\nA x = 0\nis the same as the system\na . x = 0, b . x = 0,\nc . x = 0.\nIn other words, we are looking for a row vector x which is orthogonal to three given vectors,\nnamely the three rows of A. By Section 1,we have\nIAl = a . b x c = volume of parallelepiped spanned by a, b, c.\nIt follows that if IAl = 0, the parallelepiped has zero volume, and therefore the origin vectors\na, b, c lie in a plane. Any non-zero vector x which is orthogonal to this plane will then be\northogonal to a,b, c, and therefore will be a solution to the system (24). This proves (22):\nif JAl= 0, then A x = 0 has a nontrivial solution.\n\n18.02 NOTES\nPartial proof of (23). We write the system as A x = d , where d is the column vector\nd = (dl, d2, d3)T .\nWriting this out as we did in (24), it becomes the system\nIf IAl = 0, the three origin vectors a, b, c lie in a plane, which means we can write one of\nthem, say c, as a linear combination of a and b:\n(26)\nc = r a + sb,\nr.s real numbers.\nThen if x is any vector, it follows that\nNow if x is also a solution to (25), we see from (25) and (27) that\nthis shows that unless the components of d satisfy the relation (28), there cannot be a\nsolution to (25); thus in general there are no solutions.\nIf however, d does satisfy the relation (28), then the last equation in (25) is a conse-\nquence of the first two and can be discarded, and we get a system of two equations in three\nunknowns, which will in general have a non-zero solution, unless they represent two planes\nwhich are parallel.\nSingular matrices; computational difficulties.\nBecause so much depends on whether IAl is zero or not, this property is given a name.\nWe say the square matrix A is singular if IAl = 0, and nonsingular or invertible if IAl # 0.\nIndeed, we know that A-I exists if and only if IAl # 0, which explains the term\n\"invertible\"; the use of \"singular\" will be familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans: it is\nthe 19th century version of \"peculiar\" or the late 20th century word \"special\".\nEven if A is nonsingular, the solution of Ax = b is likely to run into trouble if IAl z 0,\nor as one says, A is almost-singular. Namely, in the formulas given in Cramer's rule (19),\nthe IAI occurs in the denominator, so that unless there is some sort of compensation for\nthis in the numerator, the solutions are likely to be very sensitive to small changes in the\ncoefficients of A, i.e., to the coefficients of the equations. Systems (of any kind) whose\nsolutions behave this way are said to be ill-conditioned; it is difficult to solve such systems\nnumerically and special methods must be used.\nTo see the difficulty geometrically, think of a 2 x 2 system Ax = b as representing a pair\nof lines; the solution is the point in which they intersect. If IAl E 0, but its entries are\nnot small, then its two rows must be vectors which are almost parallel (since they span a\nparallelogram of small area). The two lines are therefore almost parallel; their intersection\npoint exists, but its position is highly sensitive to the exact positions of the two lines, i.e.,\nto the values of the coefficients of the system of equations.\nExercises: Section 1H"

Non-independent Variables\n1. Partial differentiation with non-independent variables.\nUp to now in calculating partial derivatives of functions like w = f (x, y) or w = f (x, y, z),\nwe have assumed the variables x, y (or x, y,z) were independent. However in real-world\napplications this is frequently not so. Computing partial derivatives then becomes confusing,\nbut it is better to face these complications now while you are still in a calculus course,\nthan wait to be hit with them at the same time that you are struggling to cope with the\nthermodynamics or economics or whatever else is involved.\nFor example, in thermodynamics, three variables that are associated with a contained\ngas are its\np = pressure,\nv = volume,\nT = temperature,\nand you can express other thermodynamic variables like the internal energy U and entropy\nS in terms of p, v, and T.\nHowever, p, v, and T are not independent variables. If the gas is a so-called \"ideal gas\",\nthey are related by the equation\n(I)\npv = nRT\n(n,R constants).\nTo see what complications this produces, let's consider first a purely mathematical example.\ndw\nExample 1. Let w = x2 + y2 + z2, where z = x2 + y2.\nCalculate - .\ndx\nDiscussion.\naw\n(a) If we think of x and y as the independent variables, then we can calculate -\nax by\ntwo different methods:\n(i) using z = x2 + Y2 to get rid of z, we get\nw = x2 + y2 + (x2 + y2)2\n= x2 + y2 + x4 + 2x2y2+ y4;\n(ii) or by using the chain rule, remembering z is a function of x and y,\nw = x 2 + y 2 + z 2\nso the two methods agree.\n(b) On the other hand, if we think of x and z as the independent variables, using say\nmethod (i) above, we get rid of y by using the relation y2 = z - x2, and get\nw = x2 + y2 + z2 = z2+ (2 - x2) + z2\n= Z + z2;\n\nN. NON-INDEPENDENT VARIABLES\nThese answers are genuinely different - we cannot convert one into the other by using\nthe relation z = x2 +y2. Will the right dwldx please stand up?\nThe answer is, that there is no one right answer, because the problem was not well-stated.\nWhen the variables are not independent, an expression like dwldx does not have a definite\nmeaning.\nTo see why this is so, we interpret the above example geometrically. Saying that x, y, z\nsatisfy the relation z = x2 +y2 means that the point (x, y, z) lies on the paraboloid surface\nformed by rotating z = y2 about the z-axis. The function\nI z\nI\nw = x2 + y 2 +z2\nmeasures the square of the distance from the origin. To be defi-\nnite, let's suppose we are at the starting point P = Po : (1,0,1)\nindicated, and we want to calculate dwldx at this point.\nCase (a) If we take x and y to be the independent variables, then to find\ndwldx, we hold y fixed and let x vary. So P moves in the xz-plane towards A,\nalong the path shown.\nAs P moves along this path, evidently w, the square of its distance from the\ndw\norigin, is steadily increasing: - > 0 and in fact the calculations for (a) on\n- dx\ni3w\nthe previous page show that - = 6.\ndx\nCase (b) If we take x and z to be the independent variables, then to find\ndwldx, we hold z fixed and let x vary. Now P moves in the plane a = 1, along\nthe circular path towards B.\nAs P moves on this path, the square of its distance from the origin is not\ndw\nchanging, and therefore - = 0,\nas we calculated in (b) before.\nax\nTo sum up, the value of dw/dx depends on which variables we take to be independent,\nbecause we are actually measuring different rates of change, as P moves along different\npaths.\nThere is only one way out of our difficulty. When we ask for dwldx, we must at the same\ntime specify which variables are to be taken as the independent ones. This is done by using\nthe following notation:\nCase (a): x, y are the independent variables: (E)\nCase (b) : x, z are the independent variables: (E)\nThese are read, \"the partial of w with respect to x, with y (resp. z) held constant\".\nNote how in each case the two lower letters give you the two independent variables. If we\nhad more variables, we would use a similar notation. For instance if\n(2)\nw = f (2, y, z, t),\nwhere xy = zt,\nthen only three of the variables x, y, z, t can be independent; the fourth is then determined\n\n18.02 NOTES\nby the equation on the right of (2). Thus we would write expressions like\n(E)\n\"partial of w with respect to x; y and t held constant\";\n,,t\n(%)\n\"partial of w with respect to y; x and z held constant\";\n,,,\nin the first, x, y, t are the independent variables; in the second, x, y, z are independent.\n2. Differentials vs. Chain Rule\nAn alternative way of calculating partial derivatives uses total differentials. We illustrate\nwith an example, doing it first with the chain rule, then repeating it using differentials. By\ndefinition, the differential of a function of several variables, such as w = f (x, y, z) is\nwhere the three partial derivatives fx, f,, f, are the formal partial derivatives, i.e., the\nderivatives calculated as if x, y, z were independent.\nExample 2. Find\n, where w = x3y - z2t and\nxy = zt.\nSolution 1. Using the chain rule and the two equations in the problem, we have\nSolution 2. We take the differentials of both sides of the two equations in the problem:\nSince the problem indicates that x, y, t are the independent variables, we eliminate dz from\nthe equations in (4) by multiplying the second equation by 22, adding it to the first, then\ngrouping the terms, which gives\nComparing this with (3) - after replacing z by t in (3) -we see that\n(The actual partial derivatives are the same as the formal partial derivatives w,, w,, wt\nbecause x, y, t are independent variables.)\nNotice that the differential method here takes a bit more calculation, but gives us three\nderivatives, not just one; this is fine if you want all three, but a little wasteful if you don't.\nThe main thing to keep in mind for the method is that differentials are treated like vectors,\nwith the dx, dy, dz, . . . playing the role of i , j , k , . . . . That is:\n\nN. NON-INDEPENDENT VARIABLES\nDl. Differentials can be added, subtracted, and multiplied by scalar functions;\nD2. If the variables x, y,. . . are independent, two differentials are equal if and only if\ntheir corresponding coefficients are equal:\nD3. One differential can be substituted into another.\nRemarks.\n1. In Example 2, Solution 2, we used the operations in D l to do the calculations. We\nused D2 in the last step, taking advantage of the fact that the x, y, t were independent.\nWe could have done the calculations using D3 instead, by solving the second equation in\n(4) for dz and substituting it into the first equation. D3 is a consequence of the chain rule.\nIllustrations of its use will be given in the next section.\n2. The main advantage of calculating with differentials is that one need not take into\naccount whether the variables are dependent or not, or which variables depend on which\nothers; the method does this automatically for you. Examples will illustrate.\n3. If the variables are not independent, D2 is emphatically not true; the second equation\nin (4) gives a counterexample.\nNote also that in Dl, there is no attempt to include a \"multiplication\" or \"division\" of\ndifferentials to the list of operations. If u and v are functions of several variables, then\ntheir \"product\" dudv makes no sense as a differential, nor does their \"quotient\" duldv,\nwhich despite appearances is not in general related to any derivative, or function, or even\ndefined. (There is no elementary analogue of the dot and cross product of vectors, though in\nadvanced differential geometry courses a certain type of product for differentials is defined\nand used for multiple integration.)\nExample 3.\nLet\nw = x2 - yz + t2, where x, y, z, t satisfy the two equations\nz 2 = x + y\nand\nxy = zt.\nUsing these equations, we can express first z and then t in terms of x and y; this means\nthat w can also be expressed in terms of x and y.\nWithout actually calculating w(x, y)\nexplicitly, find its gradient vector Vw (x, y) .\nSolution. Since we need both partial derivatives (dwldx), and (dwldy),, it makes\nsense to use the differential method. Taking the differential of w and of the two equations\nconnecting the variables gives us\n(6) dw = 2xdx - zdy - ydz +2tdt,\nxdy +ydx = zdt + tdz,\n2zdz = dx + 2ydy.\nWe want x and y to be the independent variables; using the operations in Dl, first eliminate\ndt by solving for it in the second equation, and substituting for it into the first equation; then\neliminate dz by solving for it in the last equation and substituting into the first equation;\nthe result is\nSince x and y are independent, comparing the two expressions for dw in (7) and (3) (using\nx and y), and then using D2, shows that the two coefficients in (7) are respectively the two\npartial derivatives w, and w,, i.e., the two components of the gradient Vw.\n\n18.02 NOTES\nExample 4. Suppose the variables x, y, z satisfy an equation g(x, y, z) = 0. Assume\nthe point P : (1,1,1) lies on the surface g = 0 and that (Vg)p = (-1,1,2).\nLet f (x, y, z) be another function, and assume that (Vf ) p = (1,2,1).\nFind the gradient of the function w = f (x, y, z(x, y)) of the two independent variables x\nand y, at the point x = 1, y = 1.\nSolution. Using differentials, we have, by (3) and our hypotheses,\n(dw)p = dx + 2dy + dz;\n(dg)p = -dx + dy + 2dz = 0,\nsince dg = 0 for all x, y, z;\neliminating dz by solving the second equation for it and substituting into the first, or by\ndividing the second equation by 2 and substracting it from the first, we get\n3. Abstract partial differentiation; rules relating partial derivatives\nOften in applications, the function w is not given explicitly, nor are the equations con-\nnecting the variables. Thus you need to be able to work with functions and equations just\ngiven abstractly. The previous ideas work perfectly well, as we will illustrate. However, we\nwill need (as in section 2) to distinguish between\nformal partial derivatives, written here fx, fy, ... (calculated as if all the variables were\nindependent), and\nactual partial derivatives, written af /ax,. ..,which take account of any relations between\nthe variables.\nExample 5. If\nf (x, y, z) = xy2z4, where z = 22 + 3y,\nthen the three formal\nderivatives are\nwhile three of the many possible actual partial derivatives are (we use the chain rule)\nRules connecting partial derivatives. These rules are widely used in the applications,\nespecially in thermodynamics. Here we will use them as an excuse for further practice with\nthe chain rule and differentials.\nWith an eye to thermodynamics, we assume a set of variables t, v,v, w, x, y, z, .. . con-\nnected by several equations in such a way that\nany two are independent;\nany three are connected by an equation.\nThus, one can choose any two of them to be the independent variables, and then each of\nthe other variables can be expressed in terms of these two.\n\nN. NON-INDEPENDENT VARIABLES\nWe give each rule in two forms-the\nsecond form is the one ordinarily used, while the\nfirst is easier to remember. (The first two rules are fairly simple in either form.)\n(2)\nreciprocal rule\n(2)\n= (ay/ax),\n(\n(ax/at)z\nchain rule\n= (\n($>,\n(a,\n= (%/at)Z7\nax/&)^,\ncyclic rule\n= - ca~/az)x\nNote how the successive factors in the cyclic rule are formed: the variables are used in the\nsuccessive orders x, y, z; y, z, x; z, x, y; one says they are permuted cyclically, and this\nexplains the name.\nProof of the rules. The first two rules are simple: since z is being held fixed throughout,\neach variable becomes a function of just one other variable, and (9) is just the one-variable\nchain rule. Then (8) is just the special case of (9) where x = t.\nThe cyclic rule is less obvious -on the right side it looks almost like the chain rule, but\ndifferent variables are being held constant in each of the differentiations, and this changes it\nentirely. To prove it, we suppose f(x, y, z) = 0 is the equation satisfied by x, y, z; taking y\nand z as the independent variables and differentiating f(a, y, z) = 0 with respect to y gives:\n+ fy = 0;\ntherefore (2) = -f\" .\nz\nfx\nPermuting the variables in (11) and multiplying the resulting three equations gives (10a):\nExample 6. Suppose w = w(x, r), with r = r (x, 8). Give an expression for\nterms of formal partial derivatives of w and r.\nSolution. Evidently the independent variables are to be r and 8, since these are the\nones that occur in the lower part of the partial derivative, with x dependent on them. Since\n8 is viewed as a constant, the chain rule gives\nby the reciprocal rule (8). and therefore finally,\n\n18.02 NOTES\n4.\nChanging the independent variables.* For those of you who will study\nthermodynamics, a major use of the rules of the preceding section is to change physical\nlaws expressed in terms of one pair of independent variables to another pair which is better\nadapted to the particular problem at hand.\nIn thermodynamics, some of the variables associated with a confined gas are p (pressure),\nV (volume), T (temperature), U (internal energy), S (entropy), and H (enthalpy). Any\ntwo are independent, and their values then determine all the others.\nTo avoid confusion, it is better to state our general problem in terms of a neutral list\nof variables (g)\n- we will use u, v, w, x, y. Then we can state the problem this way: a partial\nderivative\nis given, where the A, B, C are three of these variables,\n(g)c\nand we want to\nC\nuse x and y as the new independent\n(g)\nvariables; i.e.,\n(g)\nwe want to express\nin terms\n.\n.\n-\nof partial derivatives that look like\nand\nx, where r stands for any of the\nvariables.\nIt looks like there will be many cases, but outside of the trivial ones, the most commonly\noccurring ones are all handled by the rules of the previous section.\nThe trivial cases are when two of A, B, C are equal:\nA = B;\nA = C;\nundefined, B = C.\nTwo more \"trivial\" cases are when B and C are x and y, in either order, since then the\npartial derivative is already in the desired form.\nThe rest of the cases are non-trivial, but are covered by the rules. Remembering that x\nand y are to be the new variables, the commonly occurring cases are these two:\n(8)\n(aA'ay)x\n(chain rule (9))\n= (asjay).,\nIn the above, x and y can be interchanged; A, B, C stand for any variables; u, v, w are any\nvariables other than x or y. The reciprocal rule can be used as a preliminary step to put a\ngiven partial derivative into one of the above forms.\nExample 7. One of the laws of thermodynamics is expressed by the equation\nWhat is the equation for this law when V and T are the independent variables?\n\nN. NON-INDEPENDENT VARIABLES\nSolution. Looking at each derivative in turn, the first has the form (13) and needs the\nchain rule; the second has the form (14) and needs the cyclic rule; the last needs only the\nreciprocal rule. Using these, the equation is transformed into\nThe subscripts are unnecessary, if it is known that T and V are the independent variables;\nhowever there is no harm in including them and removing the common denominator, which\ngives finally\n(E),-\nT (2); P = 0\nas the form the law takes when referred to the variables V and T.\n5. Additional rules.* For the sake of completeness, we add two more rules which will\nenable you to make even uncommon selections of independent variables.\nTo state these last two rules, we need a determinant called the Jacobian. We give the\nnotation and definition for two functions u(x, y) and v(x, y):\na(u,v)\n---\na(x,\n(the Jaeobian);\nY)\nfor three functions of three variables, etc. the definition would be analogous.\nJacobian rule\ntwo-Jacobian rule\nWe leave the proof of the Jacobian rule (16b) as a good exercise in the use of differentials;\nthe form (16a) follows from it by applying the chain rule (9b) and the definition (15).\nThe two-Jacobian rule can be proved directly either with differentials or the standard\nchain rule for functions of several variables. It is the mother of all rules: the other four can\nbe derived from it by making some of the variables equal to each other.\nAs in section 4, these new rules allow the remaining choices of independent variable:\nExercises: Section 25"

Partial Differential Equations\nAn important application of the higher partial derivatives is that they are used in partial\ndifferential equations to express some laws of physics which are basic to most science and\nengineering subjects. In this section, we will give examples of a few such equations. The\nreason is partly cultural, so you meet these equations early and learn to recognize them,\nand partly technical: to give you a little more practice with the chain rule and computing\nhigher derivatives.\nA partial differential equation, PDE for short, is an equation involving some unknown\nfunction of several variables and one or more of its partial derivatives. For example,\nis such an equation. Evidently here the unknown function is a function of two variables\nwe infer this from the equation, since only x and y occur in it as independent variables. In\ngeneral a solution of a partial differential equation is a differentiable function that satisfies\nit. In the above example, the functions\nw = xnyn\nany n\nall are solutions to the equation. In general, PDE's have many solutions, far too many\nto find all of them. The problem is always to find the one solution satisfying some extra\nconditions, usually called either boundary conditions or initial conditions depending on their\nnature.\nOur first important PDE is the Laplace equation in three dimensions:\nAny steady-state temperature distribution in three-space\n(2)\nW = T ( x , Y , ~ ) ,\nT = temperature at the point (x,y, z)\nsatisfies Laplace's equation. (Here steady-state means that it is unchanging over time, here\nreflected in the fact that T is not a function of time. For example, imagine a solid object\nmade of some uniform heat-conducting material (say a solid metal ball), and imagine a\nsteady temperature distribution on its surface is maintained somehow (say with some ar-\nrangement of wires and thermostats). Then after a while the temperature at each point\ninside the ball will come to equilibrium - reach a steady state - and the resulting tem-\nperature function (2) inside the ball will then satisfy Laplace's equation.\nAs another example, the gravitational potential\n\nP. PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\nresulting from some arrangement of masses in space satisfies Laplace's equation in any region\nR of space not containing masses. The same is true of the electrostatic potential resulting\nfrom some collection of electric charges in space: (1) is satisfied in any region which is free of\ncharge. This potential function measures the work done (against the field) carrying a unit\ntest mass (or charge) from a fixed reference point to the point (x, y, z) in the gravitational\n(or electrostatic) field. Knowing 4, the field itself can be recovered as its negative gradient:\nAll of this is just to stress the fundamental character of Laplace's equation - we live our\nlives surrounded by its solutions.\nThe two-dimensional Laplace equation is similar - you just drop the term involving\nz. The steady-state temperature distribution in a flat metal plate would satisfy the two-\ndimensional Laplace equation, if the faces of the plate were kept insulated and a steady-state\ntemperature distribution maintained around the edges of the plate.\nIf in the temperature model we include also heat sources and sinks in the region, un-\nchanging over time, the temperature function satisfies the closely related Poisson equation\nwhere f is some given function related to the sources and sinks.\nAnother important PDE is the wave equation; given below are the one-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional versions; the three dimensional version would add a similar term in z to\nthe left:\nHere x, y, . . . are the space variables, t is the time, and c is the velocity with which the wave\ntravels -this depends on the medium and the type of wave (light, sound, etc.). A solution,\nrespectively\nW = w(x,t),\nW = w ( x , Y , ~ ) ,\ngives for each moment to of time the shape w(x, to), w(x, y, to) of the wave.\nThe third PDE goes by two names, depending on the context: heat equation or diffusion\nequation. The one- and two-dimensional versions are respectively\nIt looks a lot like the wave equation (4), but the right-hand side this time involves only the\nfirst derivative, which gives it mathematically and physically an entirely different character.\nWhen it is called the (one-dimensional) heat equation, a solution w(x, t) represents a\ntime-varying temperature distribution in say a uniform conducting metal rod, with insulated\nsides. In the same way, w(x, y, t) would be the time-varying temperature distribution in a\nflat metal plate with insulated faces. For each moment to in time, w(x, y,to) gives the\ntemperature distribution at that moment.\nFor example, if we assume the distribution is steady-state, i.e., not changing with time,\nthen\naw\n- = O\n(steady-state condition)\na t\n\n18.02 NOTES\nand the two-dimensional heat equation would turn into the two-dimensional Laplace equa-\ntion (1).\nWhen (5) is referred to as the dzfluszon equation, say in one dimension, then w(x,t)\nrepresents the concentration of a dissolved substance diffusing along a uniform tube filled\nwith liquid, or of a gas diffusing down a uniform pipe.\nNotice that all of these PDE's are second-order, that is, involve derivatives no higher than\nthe second. There is an important fourth-order PDE in elasticity theory (the bilaplacian\nequation), but by and large the general rule seems to be either that Nature is content with\nlaws that only require second partial derivatives, or that these are the only laws that humans\nare intelligent enough to formulate.\nExercises: Section 2K"
