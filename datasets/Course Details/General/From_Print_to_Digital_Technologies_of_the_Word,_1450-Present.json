  "course_name": "From Print to Digital: Technologies of the Word, 1450-Present",
  "course_description": "There has been much discussion in recent years, on this campus and elsewhere, about the death of the book. Digitization and various forms of electronic media, some critics say, are rendering the printed text as obsolete as the writing quill. In this subject, we will examine the claims for and against the demise of the book, but we will also supplement these arguments with an historical perspective they lack: we will examine texts, printing technologies, and reading communities from roughly 1450 to the present. We will begin with the theoretical and historical overviews of Walter Ong and Elizabeth Eisenstein, after which we will study specific cases such as English chapbooks, Inkan knotted and dyed strings, late nineteenth-century recording devices, and newspapers online today. We will also visit a rare book library and make a poster on a hand-set printing press.",

Attendance is mandatory, and students are expected to arrive in class on time and prepared to discuss common readings. A student who misses two or more class sessions will automatically fail the subject. At the beginning of most class sessions, students will hand in two-page papers that address issues from that week's readings; the questions will be distributed in advance. A ten-page paper will be due in class in Lec #6, and a five page paper due on the last day of classes, five days after Lec #12. I will hand out instructions for these assignments later in the semester. There will be no exams and no final. Each assignment will be weighted as follows in the calculation of the final grade, although these calculations will also take into account improved performance during the course of the semester:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nVALUES\n\nClass Participation\n\n40 points\n\nHomework (8 Assignments)\n\n40 points (5 points each)\n\nTen-page Paper\n\n80 points\n\nFive-page Paper\n\n40 points\n\nTotal\n\n200 points\n\nStatement on Cheating and Plagiarism\n\nThe Web now hosts many sites which offer college-level papers of varying quality on a variety of topics.

      "content": "(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\nDavid Proudfoot\n\nJournal of Johannes Gutenberg\nEntry December 5th, 2005\n\nToday I will not be going into the specifics of how I got to this time and place or\ntheorizing the mechanics by which it may have been achieved. Since arriving this has\nbeen, understandably I think, all that has occupied my mind. But I have written enough\nabout this subject in the entries of the past weeks and I am still no closer to resolution of\nthe question. Today's entry will be much different, for I have finally figured out where,\nexactly, I am.\nI have been staying the past couple of days with a young man named David\nProudfoot. He has taken me into his room under the assumption that I am a \"pre-frosh.\"\nFrom what I have gathered from materials in his room (he has many books, as do all the\nstudents, my invention must have succeeded), he is a student at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology. It seems that these pre-frosh are people visiting the school,\ndeciding if they want to go there. I figured I would not correct him, as this would be the\nperfect guise to cover the ignorance of my general situation.\nAs I had never heard of this Massachusetts, I did some more research yesterday\nwhile he was at class. I walked across the concrete paths, narrowly escaping being\ntrampled by the roaring, beeping, mechanical beasts I have described in previous entries\nand entered a shop whose sign read Store 24. In here, I found a map (many printed\ncopies were available very cheaply, it was great to see yet another application of my\nwork) of this place called Massachusetts. I was able to establish my location by\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\nreferencing some of the signs I had seen at the road intersections with those on the map.\nIt appears I am in a city called Boston, and very near the coast. But what coast?\nI picked up a different map. This map seemed to be for an entire country called\nthe United States of America. Massachusetts, it seems, it just one of the fifty states I\ncounted on this map. It is located in the Northeast coast of what looks like a very\nextensive country. This, of course, brought up more new questions than it answered.\nWhere could this massive country have come from? Surely in the five and a half\ncenturies I had been dormant, governments could have fallen and borders been reformed,\nbut this land mass looked like nothing I had ever seen. Had the continents shifted so\nquickly? Was I even still on my home planet, the Earth?\nI decided this was an important enough question to risk exposing who I really\nwas. When Mr. Proudfoot came back from class that day I approached him about the\nsubject. I asked him to tell me about the United States. He said, \"What do you mean\nabout the US? Aren't you from here?\" I said that no, I was in fact from Germany. I was\nrelieved to find out that I had not revealed myself with this fact, as he replied, \"Oh,\nyou're one of the exchange students. I got ya. Well you must want to know a bit more\nabout our history then?\" When I replied in the affirmative he brought me to the most\nstrange and wonderful machine I have ever laid my eyes upon.\n\"This,\" he said, \"is my computer. Feel free to use the internet. Just click on\nInternet Explorer over there.\" I stared at the machine. All the letters of the alphabet,\nnumbers, and punctuation were laid out on small squares in front of me. It immediately\nbrought to mind the cases of type we had kept for the presses. However, these letters\nonly seemed to move in and out of the machine and were not raised to print. I looked\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\nback at Mr. Proudfoot who immediately picked up on my confusion. \"What's the matter?\nDon't tell me you've never used the internet before.\" I replied, \"Actually, sir, I am from\na very small town in Germany. I have never used one of these internet machines.\" After\na moment of looking at me in a manner that suggested he was equally as puzzled as I\nwas, he recovered and said, \"This isn't an internet machine, it's a computer. You just\naccess the internet through it.\"\nMr. Proudfoot took the rest of his afternoon to help me learn to use the computer\nmachine. It was an interesting, if not confusing experience. Apparently, much of the\nfunction of the machine has descended from my printing press! The first thing he taught\nme to do was to \"type.\" In a way, this is much like type setting type on the press.\nHowever, through mechanisms which I cannot begin to comprehend, only the one set of\ntype laid out before me (I would come to find this is called the keyboard) was required.\nSimply striking these keys would make the corresponding characters appear on the\nmedium in front of me, which Mr. Proudfoot called the screen. Now, it is important to\nnote that the screen was rather large. The space the type appeared on was about the size\nof the sheet of paper...but it was much deeper, much heavier, and much harder. It did not\nseem to be much use. What good was this screen? It was hardly portable. You could not\nfold it up and put it in your pocket. I couldn't imagine storing these screens, how much\nwould space would even a single book take up?\nWhen I brought these concerns up, Mr. Proudfoot laughed and took the \"mouse\"\n(a device used to move a pointer on the screen) in his hand. He moved the cursor over a\nbutton on the screen and clicked one of the devices buttons. Next to me, another machine\ncame to life with a whir of machinery. Only seconds later a piece of paper came out. I\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\nstudied the leaflet closely. It was covered in printed text. It was perfectly spaced. The\nletters seemed perfectly constructed. No ink was smudged, yet I could tell it certainly ink\nthat had formed the characters. The print job was all around flawless. Only then did I\nread the text...it was the words I had just typed. I looked at this printer and my eyes\nfollowed a small cable from it to the computer machine. That was it, just a small cable,\nno bigger than the diameter of my pinky, had transferred the type I had set on the screen\nto the printer. I looked back at the screen and to my astonishment I realized that I was\nwrong. The type had not been transferred, it was still there. It had been copied.\nThe computer had made for me, completely uninitiated in its ways, possible in\nminutes what would have taken hours or days on my machine by an skilled printer. I was\noverwhelmed. And as hard as it may be to believe, the most astonishing ability of the\ncomputer was yet to come.\nAfter I had realized the computer and printer were capable of spreading ideas\nfaster than I had ever dreamed possible with my press, we moved on to the reason I had\nbeen shown the computer in the first place. Mr. Proudfoot once again took control of the\nmouse. In an instant, the type I had laid out disappeared from the screen. A few seconds\nlater, the screen was washed in white with a few multicolored letters in the middle that\nspelled out \"Google.\" Below this title was a gray box, in which the computer's cursor\nblinked on and off, expectantly. \"There you are,\" Mr. Proudfoot said, \"Now you can\nlook up whatever you want to know about the US. Just type in what you are looking for.\"\nSo I did. I searched for United States of America.\nThe Google page disappeared. In its place, a new Google page appeared. At the\nvery top of this page, a miniaturized version of the Google logo and grey text box were\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\nfound. Below that were a few pictures of the Untied States, outlines of the same country\nI had found in the maps. The rest of the page contained titles in blue, with small\ndescriptions underneath. I was interested in some of these titles, but the descriptions did\nnot get me very far. Using the mouse, however, I was able to \"click\" on the titles and\nopen up whole new pages. On these pages, too, were blue underlined words. I could\nclick on these to bring up whole new pages...instantly.\nThe amount of information I was presented with in such a short time was\nshocking. I found the answer to my earlier questions quickly. Shortly after my time, a\nSpanish man named Christopher Columbus had set sail to the west, determined that the\nworld was indeed not flat and that he could loop around and find the short way to India.\nWhile he was right about the world being round, he did not find India. Instead he found a\nwhole new continent. There were two of them in fact, North and South America. The\nEuropean counties sent people over to lay claim to the new world. The different\ncountries went to war with each other for the land. Eventually, some of the colonists\ndecided they didn't like being fought over, and they formed their own country, the United\nStates of America. So it is still all there, the rest of the world I had known. This place is\njust a new addition.\nHaving missed all this, however, I must have mad a million new questions. The\ninternet brought me so many answers, and quickly. I couldn't believe the amount of\ninformation this little machine had stored. I asked Mr. Proudfoot how it knew so much.\n\"It doesn't. It's all out there,\" he responded, waving his hands in no specific direction,\n\"on the internet. My computer is just hooked up to it. The internet doesn't know things,\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\npeople know things. Then they type those things up and put them on the internet.\" So\nthere it was. All along, the power had been in the people, not the machine.\nWhen I invented the printing press I knew it could it have far reaching effects if\npeople utilized it properly. I always thought it was the greatest triumph of my life,\nbringing the technology to let people spread their ideas easier, to give more people access\nto the knowledge of the world. The computer and printer had made this process even\neasier, but it is the internet that will take this idea beyond my dreams. I was amazed\nwhen the page came out of Mr. Proudfoot's printing machine, but the information that is\nnot even printed is the most revolutionary. Anyone with access to a computer and the\ninternet can retrieve enormous volumes of information and opinions, more than all the\nlibraries in my Germany combined. And all these same people can become publishers\nthemselves, sharing their own ideas or adding to the collective knowledge of the society.\nIn my weeks here in 2005 I have seen the effects that my press has had on the\nworld. Printed material is everywhere. Newspapers are distributed throughout the city,\nthe students' rooms are filled with large, illuminated text books, and smaller paper back\nbooks are found on every last shelf I've seen. But the effects of my invention will be\ndwarfed by the internet. In only the few days I have been using it I can understand. It\nprovides instant access to any piece of knowledge that exists. Every time I need to know\nsomething now, I can just \"Google it.\" It would indeed seem that if it doesn't exist on the\ninternet, man kind has not yet discovered it.\nSo I finally figured out where I am. In a house, in the city of Boston, in the state\nof Massachusetts, in the country of United States of America, on the planet Earth, in the\ntime of the Information Revolution."

Surely in the five and a half\ncenturies I had been dormant, governments could have fallen and borders been reformed,\nbut this land mass looked like nothing I had ever seen. Had the continents shifted so\nquickly? Was I even still on my home planet, the Earth?\nI decided this was an important enough question to risk exposing who I really\nwas. When Mr. Proudfoot came back from class that day I approached him about the\nsubject. I asked him to tell me about the United States. He said, \"What do you mean\nabout the US? Aren't you from here?\" I said that no, I was in fact from Germany. I was\nrelieved to find out that I had not revealed myself with this fact, as he replied, \"Oh,\nyou're one of the exchange students. I got ya. Well you must want to know a bit more\nabout our history then?\" When I replied in the affirmative he brought me to the most\nstrange and wonderful machine I have ever laid my eyes upon.\n\"This,\" he said, \"is my computer. Feel free to use the internet. Just click on\nInternet Explorer over there.\" I stared at the machine. All the letters of the alphabet,\nnumbers, and punctuation were laid out on small squares in front of me. It immediately\nbrought to mind the cases of type we had kept for the presses. However, these letters\nonly seemed to move in and out of the machine and were not raised to print. I looked\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\nback at Mr. Proudfoot who immediately picked up on my confusion. \"What's the matter?\nDon't tell me you've never used the internet before.\" I replied, \"Actually, sir, I am from\na very small town in Germany. I have never used one of these internet machines.\" After\na moment of looking at me in a manner that suggested he was equally as puzzled as I\nwas, he recovered and said, \"This isn't an internet machine, it's a computer. You just\naccess the internet through it.\"\nMr. Proudfoot took the rest of his afternoon to help me learn to use the computer\nmachine. It was an interesting, if not confusing experience. Apparently, much of the\nfunction of the machine has descended from my printing press! The first thing he taught\nme to do was to \"type.\" In a way, this is much like type setting type on the press.\nHowever, through mechanisms which I cannot begin to comprehend, only the one set of\ntype laid out before me (I would come to find this is called the keyboard) was required.\nSimply striking these keys would make the corresponding characters appear on the\nmedium in front of me, which Mr. Proudfoot called the screen. Now, it is important to\nnote that the screen was rather large. The space the type appeared on was about the size\nof the sheet of paper...but it was much deeper, much heavier, and much harder. It did not\nseem to be much use. What good was this screen? It was hardly portable. You could not\nfold it up and put it in your pocket. I couldn't imagine storing these screens, how much\nwould space would even a single book take up?\nWhen I brought these concerns up, Mr. Proudfoot laughed and took the \"mouse\"\n(a device used to move a pointer on the screen) in his hand. He moved the cursor over a\nbutton on the screen and clicked one of the devices buttons. Next to me, another machine\ncame to life with a whir of machinery. Only seconds later a piece of paper came out. I\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\nstudied the leaflet closely. It was covered in printed text. It was perfectly spaced. The\nletters seemed perfectly constructed. No ink was smudged, yet I could tell it certainly ink\nthat had formed the characters. The print job was all around flawless. Only then did I\nread the text...it was the words I had just typed. I looked at this printer and my eyes\nfollowed a small cable from it to the computer machine. That was it, just a small cable,\nno bigger than the diameter of my pinky, had transferred the type I had set on the screen\nto the printer. I looked back at the screen and to my astonishment I realized that I was\nwrong. The type had not been transferred, it was still there. It had been copied.\nThe computer had made for me, completely uninitiated in its ways, possible in\nminutes what would have taken hours or days on my machine by an skilled printer. I was\noverwhelmed. And as hard as it may be to believe, the most astonishing ability of the\ncomputer was yet to come.\nAfter I had realized the computer and printer were capable of spreading ideas\nfaster than I had ever dreamed possible with my press, we moved on to the reason I had\nbeen shown the computer in the first place. Mr. Proudfoot once again took control of the\nmouse. In an instant, the type I had laid out disappeared from the screen. A few seconds\nlater, the screen was washed in white with a few multicolored letters in the middle that\nspelled out \"Google.\" Below this title was a gray box, in which the computer's cursor\nblinked on and off, expectantly. \"There you are,\" Mr. Proudfoot said, \"Now you can\nlook up whatever you want to know about the US. Just type in what you are looking for.\"\nSo I did. I searched for United States of America.\nThe Google page disappeared. In its place, a new Google page appeared. At the\nvery top of this page, a miniaturized version of the Google logo and grey text box were\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\nfound. Below that were a few pictures of the Untied States, outlines of the same country\nI had found in the maps. The rest of the page contained titles in blue, with small\ndescriptions underneath. I was interested in some of these titles, but the descriptions did\nnot get me very far. Using the mouse, however, I was able to \"click\" on the titles and\nopen up whole new pages. On these pages, too, were blue underlined words. I could\nclick on these to bring up whole new pages...instantly.\nThe amount of information I was presented with in such a short time was\nshocking. I found the answer to my earlier questions quickly. Shortly after my time, a\nSpanish man named Christopher Columbus had set sail to the west, determined that the\nworld was indeed not flat and that he could loop around and find the short way to India.\nWhile he was right about the world being round, he did not find India. Instead he found a\nwhole new continent. There were two of them in fact, North and South America. The\nEuropean counties sent people over to lay claim to the new world. The different\ncountries went to war with each other for the land. Eventually, some of the colonists\ndecided they didn't like being fought over, and they formed their own country, the United\nStates of America. So it is still all there, the rest of the world I had known. This place is\njust a new addition.\nHaving missed all this, however, I must have mad a million new questions. The\ninternet brought me so many answers, and quickly. I couldn't believe the amount of\ninformation this little machine had stored. I asked Mr. Proudfoot how it knew so much.\n\"It doesn't. It's all out there,\" he responded, waving his hands in no specific direction,\n\"on the internet. My computer is just hooked up to it. The internet doesn't know things,\n\n(Courtesy of David Proudfoot. Used with permission.)\npeople know things. Then they type those things up and put them on the internet.\" So\nthere it was. All along, the power had been in the people, not the machine.\nWhen I invented the printing press I knew it could it have far reaching effects if\npeople utilized it properly. I always thought it was the greatest triumph of my life,\nbringing the technology to let people spread their ideas easier, to give more people access\nto the knowledge of the world. The computer and printer had made this process even\neasier, but it is the internet that will take this idea beyond my dreams. I was amazed\nwhen the page came out of Mr. Proudfoot's printing machine, but the information that is\nnot even printed is the most revolutionary. Anyone with access to a computer and the\ninternet can retrieve enormous volumes of information and opinions, more than all the\nlibraries in my Germany combined. And all these same people can become publishers\nthemselves, sharing their own ideas or adding to the collective knowledge of the society.\nIn my weeks here in 2005 I have seen the effects that my press has had on the\nworld. Printed material is everywhere. Newspapers are distributed throughout the city,\nthe students' rooms are filled with large, illuminated text books, and smaller paper back\nbooks are found on every last shelf I've seen. But the effects of my invention will be\ndwarfed by the internet. In only the few days I have been using it I can understand. It\nprovides instant access to any piece of knowledge that exists. Every time I need to know\nsomething now, I can just \"Google it.\" It would indeed seem that if it doesn't exist on the\ninternet, man kind has not yet discovered it.\nSo I finally figured out where I am. In a house, in the city of Boston, in the state\nof Massachusetts, in the country of United States of America, on the planet Earth, in the\ntime of the Information Revolution."
