You will share\nthe lessons you learned from conducting this interview with our class on May 4 and May 9.\n\n1) Find and solicit a business/nonprofit executive for a 20 minute interview about leadership\ncommunication\nGuidelines: Your executive must have at least 10 years of experience working in business and\nhave responsibility managing others. While you may not interview a peer in your own MIT Sloan\nprogram, you may interview people in other Sloan programs who fit the profile (e.g., current\nSloan Fellows or EMBAs, if you are not in one of those programs).\nResources: Your own and your classmates' networks, MIT and MIT Sloan alumni.\n\n2) Create an interview protocol, i.e., the open-ended questions you will ask your executive to\nlearn more about the communication skills and abilities s/he has found to be most important\nfor her/his job as a business leader.\nResources: The New York Times' Corner Office Interviews, any business publication that\npublishes interviews with executives.\n\n3) Interview your executive\nGuidelines: While an in-person interview is preferable, phone/Skype interviews are possible if\nyour executive is not in the Boston area.\nResources: 15.281 readings including Humble Inquiry.\n\n4) Write up your findings in a Leadership Lessons Report, due on May 4.\nGuidelines: Your report will include (at least) the three topics listed below. The audience for your\nreport is your 15.281 faculty member and class TA. Length: 3 pages.\n- What was your process for obtaining and conducting the interview?

Did you develop your main points adequately, providing evidence from your\nactions, course readings, and the interview itself to support them?\n\nStructure of report:\nDid you provide an introduction, relevant sections (e.g., a section on each of the three\ntopics would be a reasonable way to organize the body of the report), and conclusion in\nthe report?\nDid you use direct structure to state your main ideas up front, given your audience's\nexpectations and preferences?\n\nWriting style and tone\nIs your prose clear, concise, and error-free?\nIs your tone consistent throughout the document and appropriate to the audience?\n\nDocument design\nDid you employ design elements (e.g., subheads that carry a message, lists where\nappropriate) to increase readability of document?\nDid you make it easy for your reader to find important information quickly?\n\nGrading Key for 15.281.\nAssignment fails to\ndemonstrate key\nconcepts - review of\nconcepts is\nrecommended =7.5\nor below\nAssignment below\nstandard in\ndemonstrating key\nconcepts.\nImprovement\nrequired in areas\nnoted = 8.0\nFurther\ndevelopment\nneeded in\nareas noted =\n8.5\n\nAssignment\ndemonstrates\nmastery of key skill\nareas.

      "content": "MIT Sloan, 15.281, Spring 2016, Section A\n\nAdvanced Leadership Communication\n\nPresentation to a Hostile Audience\n20% of course grade/Due in lab as scheduled\n\nPrepare, rehearse, and deliver a 10-minute persuasive presentation to a hostile audience. Visual aids\nare optional. You must plan to be interrupted by questions during the presentation. To allow extensive\ninteraction, you should prepare no more than 5 minutes worth of material. Consider limiting the\nmaterial you plan to cover in the presentation, but preparing additional back-up material to use in\nresponse to questions. Your presentation may be explicitly persuasive (e.g., recommend a project that\nyour audience actively opposes) or implicitly persuasive (e.g., tell your staff about new belt-tightening\nmeasures and convince them to accept them). Although your situation should be chosen so that the\naudience will be openly hostile, you should do your best to defuse hostility and to persuade them of\nyour point of view using evidence as well as emotional arguments.\nYou may choose your topic in conjunction with a current or past work task, project, case, or venture.\nYou may use real data, but it must be an original presentation of the material (i.e., you may not recycle\nan old presentation deck). It must be aimed at a non-Sloan audience. Below are some sample topics to\ngive you a sense of the assignment expectations:\n- You are the founder of an entrepreneurial firm that grew quickly to 50 people, but that\nstill hasn't made any revenue. Your funders are growing impatient. You have decided\nthat you need to slow the rate at which you are burning through funds until you can\nshow revenue and a path to profit. You have decided to make cuts in personnel and in\nperks. Announce this decision to your executive team or to the whole firm.\n- You are an outside consultant brought in to evaluate the upcoming launch of a new\nservice for a mobile platform. Firm X has spent a great deal of time developing this\nservice, and those directly involved are very enthusiastic about it. You have decided on\nthe basis of your study, however, that the market is not yet ready for such a service.\nYou must address a group composed of Firm X executives (including several champions\nof this project), recommending against launching the service at this time.\n- You are an executive leading a cross-functional team working on a highly visible\ncompany priority. At the midway point of this initiative, your team has failed to meet\nexpectations, and key stakeholders are beginning to question your future direction.\nNow you must present a progress report to several heavily invested senior executives\nand restore faith in your team's ability to move forward.\n\nAt the time of your presentation, hand in a typed Presentation Planner. Before you begin the\npresentation itself, share your scenario and suggest likely lines of questioning.\nYou will be graded on the following dimensions:\n1. Strategy/Argument: Did you construct a sound argument that was supported by credible\nevidence?\nOver\n\n2. Structure: Was the presentation structured in such a way that it met the audience's information\nneeds and was easy to follow?\n3. Management of hostility: How did you manage your own emotions to counter the hostility of\nyour audience? Did you structure your talk effectively to manage the audience's hostility? What\nother strategies (presentation of evidence, use of language, delivery) did you use to manage the\nexpected hostility of your audience?\n4. Delivery: Did you look and sound credible and confident? Did your delivery help diffuse the\nhostility raised in the presentation?\n5. Visual aids: If you used them, how well did your visual aids contribute to your message? How\nwell did you interact with your visual aids?\n\nGrading Key for 15.281\nAssignment fails to\ndemonstrate key\nconcepts - review of\nconcepts is\nrecommended =7.5\nor below\nAssignment below\nstandard in\ndemonstrating key\nconcepts.\nImprovement\nrequired in areas\nnoted = 8.0\nFurther\ndevelopment\nneeded in\nareas noted =\n8.5\n\nAssignment\ndemonstrates\nmastery of key skill\nareas.
