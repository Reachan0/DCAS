Not all the\nrelevant numbers are given in the problem statement. Make reasonable estimates and engineering judgments of the\nunknown parameters.\nYou have to calculate a lot of numbers. Use Matlab or Excel to do the calculations.\nProblems (the problem numbers refer to the ones in the text book):\n1.2\nDraw a free body diagram of the piston. Also calculate the cylinder pressure force on the piston for a\nhighly boosted turbo-engine at 100 bar pressure with a bore of 85 mm.\n2.5\nNote the relative magnitude of the different terms in the road power requirement. Also estimate the\nforce for accelerating the vehicle on a flat road from 40 to 60 mph in 5 seconds.\n2.8\nCalculate bsfc in g/kW-h. The exercise is to get a sense of the bfsc values; note the differences due\nto the differences in fuel LHV.\n2.13 See Figure 1-8 for timing information and Fig 2.2 for piston speeds. Combustion starts at ~20o\nBTDC and ends at ~40o ATDC. (Note that the pressure values in that figure are for part-load and not\nfor WOT operation. We are, however, only interested in the timing of the various processes; so the\nfigure is still relevant.)\nExercise that you do to enrich yourselves but you do not have to hand in anything:\nGo to the \"Related Resources\" section, look at the \"engine performance specifications\" spread sheet.\nExplore the spread sheet by sorting the data according to years, BMEP, peak power density, etc. Note\nsome of the outliers, e.g. the Honda Formula One race engine. Get a feel for the peak power density and\nthe max BMEP of the typical engines. (There are separate sheets for SI and light duty Diesel\nengines.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n2.61 Internal Combustion Engines\nSpring 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

At high temperatures, the mixture is\nmostly NO, and at low temperatures, mostly NO2. Consider a mixture with elemental composition of 1\nmole of nitrogen atom and 2 moles of oxygen atoms at a fixed pressure of 1 atmosphere. Plot the\nequilibrium mole fraction of NO as a function of temperature in the 600 to 1000 K range. (The actual\nexhaust gas is not in equilibrium; therefore, the equilibrium value of NO is a lower bound.) Note that at\nequilibrium above 1000 K, most of the gas is NO.\n(Note: you have to solve a non-linear equation. Use Matlab or Excel.)\nThe equilibrium constants from the JANAF table are:\nT(K)\nLog10Kp for NO\nLog10Kp for NO2\n-7.210\n-6.111\n-6.086\n-5.714\n-5.243\n-5.417\n-4.587\n-5.185\n-4.062\n-5.000\n2)\nProblem 3.8 of text\nIn part (c), the equilibrium constant should be 1010.2 instead of 10.2. Also, assume that there is no\ndissociation of the N2 and H2O.\nHint: in solving for the amount of CO, assume that the amount is negligibly small compare to the amount\nof CO2. Justify posteriori.\n3)\nProblem 4.1 of text.\nCalculation of exhaust composition under fuel rich condition is a tedious exercise which is usually\ncomputerized. You can use the exhaust composition program on the web (under \"good stuff\"). Look at\nthe source listing to see what is involved. If you want to, you can set K=3.5 instead of 3.7; it does not\nmake that much difference. You can also do it using the information on p. 104-105 of the text, especially\ntable 4-3. Then you have to solve the quadratic equation 4.6 yourselves ― the Matlab program on the\nweb, exhaust_compo, essentially does that. You have to supply the input variable in the calling program\nto solve the problem.)\n4)\nProblem 4.9 of text\nHint: using the exhaust composition, write the stoichiometric equation for the reaction.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n2.61 Internal Combustion Engines\nSpring 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

We are to evaluate the energetic (i.e. the energy balance) of this process.\nUseful numbers\nTo simplify the analysis, coal will be treated as solid carbon.\nDME MW = 46\n(a) The first step in coal to DME conversion is to convert the coal to\nHeat of formation\nsyngas. Oxygen is used to oxidize coal under fuel rich environment\nso that the product (syngas) is only CO. How much energy is\nreleased per kilo mole of coal as represented by solid C?\n(b) Production of DME needs both CO and H2. The feed gas should\nhave equal number of moles of CO and H2. The H2 is obtained by\nsteam reforming the CO using a catalyst. The steam will react with\nthe CO in the feed stream to form CO2 and H2.

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering\n2.61 Internal Combustion Engine\nFinal Examination (Open book; no access to internet)\nDate: Tuesday, 5/17/2016\nThere are 3 problems in this exam\nProblem 1 (15 points)\nIn the car racing business, it is known that substantial power increase may be obtained by injecting\nnitrous oxide (N2O) into the intake manifold. That it works is because:\n(a) N2O has a higher molecular weight than air. The denser gas means that more oxidizer mass can be\npacked into the combustion chamber.\n(b) N2O has much higher O to N ratio than air; so one can burn more fuel for the same charge mass\nand produce more output.\n(c) N2O itself is a fuel, although the energy release is much less than that from hydrocarbon\ncombustion.\nUsing isooctane as fuel, we are to compare the power output of the same engine using a stoichiometric\nisooctane/ air mixture and a stoichiometric mixture of isooctane and a gas comprising of 70% air and\n30% nitrous oxide by volume.\nThe heat of formation of N2O hf0 is +82.5KJ/mole. See Tables D2 and D4 of the Heywood text book\nfor properties of the working fluids.\n(i) What is the molecular weight of a stoichiometric iso-octane air mixture? (2 points)\n(ii) What is the lower heating value (LHV) of a stoichiometric iso-octane air mixture (i.e., heating\nvalue per unit mass of the mixture, *NOT* per unit mass of the fuel)? (2 points)\n(iii) What is the molar composition of the air and N2O mixture (i.e. for 1 mole of O2, how many\nmoles are there of N2 and N2O)? (2 points)\n(iv) What is the molecular weight of the stoichiometric iso-octane/air/N2O mixture? (2 points)\n(v) What is the heating value of the stoichiometric iso-octane/air/N2O mixture? (2 points)\n(vi) Using the above results, with the same engine operating at stoichiometric condition, what is the\nratio of the power output at wide-open-throttle obtained by operating with the iso-octane/air/N2O\nmixture to that obtained by operating with iso-octane/air only? (5 points)\n\nProblem 2 (15 point)\n(a) Recently (2016), Toyota has introduced the EXPAD\ntechnology to enable a gain in the engine fuel economy.\nThe method essentially involves wrapping a rubber pad in\nthe mid-section of the cylinder liner; see Fig. 2a. Explain\nhow does this technology work. (3 points)\nFig. 2a Toyota EXPAD technology;\nfrom SAE Paper 2016-01-0684, 2016\n(WJS stands for water jacket system).\n(c) Society of Automotive Engineers.

For\nmore information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n(b) High BMEP marine engines with large bore are\nconstructed with a cross-head arrangement; see Fig.\n2b. In this arrangement, the piston of the combustion\nchamber is driven by a second piston which is in\nrectilinear motion. The second piston is connected to\nthe crank shaft through the usual connecting rod /\ncrank-arm arrangement. Obviously, the additional\ncomponents add cost to the engine, and render the\nengine much taller (although the latter is not a problem\nfor marine engines since there is plenty of head room\nin a ship). Explain why would the engine designer\nchoose such a configuration. (3 points)\nFig. 2b Cross-head engine.\n(c) Source unknown. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our Creative\nCommons license. For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n(c) An inventor proposed that a turbo-charged diesel engine be configured that an additional power\nturbine is used to extract mechanical energy out of the exhaust gas to the drive shaft. The novelty\nof the proposal is that much of the shaft power is to be derived from the power turbine instead of\nthe engine. Comment on the efficiency of the overall system compared to the original engine (1\npoints). Give two further comments on whether the concept is good or bad (each comment could\neither be positive or negative respectively). (2 points)\n(d) Give two reasons why retarding the spark timing at constant idle speed at cold start would make\nthe catalyst to light-off faster. (2 points)\n(e) Give two consequences from operating a SI engine on Miller cycle; i.e. with a configuration such\nthat the compression ratio is less than the expansion ratio. (2 points)\n(f) For a spark ignition engine, why would one pursue a cylinder-deactivation strategy, i.e. deactivate\nsome of the cylinders in certain part of the engine map? (1 point). Do you want to keep the valves\nopen or closed for the deactivated cylinders and why? (1 point)\n\nProblem 3 (15 points)\nThe 3-way catalyst significantly reduces the SI engine emissions. The emission reduction capability of\na warmed-up catalyst is limited by the diffusion of the gaseous species to the catalyst surface so that\nthe concentration c of the emission species is governed by\n\n4Sh L x\nc(x) c(0)exp 2\n\nh /D U L\nHere x is the distance along the catalyst, Sh is the Sherwood number (Sh = 4 for a square channel), h is\nthe hydraulic diameter of the cell-channel, D is the diffusivity of the emission species in the exhaust\ngas, L is the length of the catalyst, and U is the flow velocity through the cell-channel.\nFor a targeted catalyst efficiency, cat =1 - c(L)/c(0) is specified.\n(a) The major cost of the catalyst is that of the precious metal. How does the cost ($) scales with h?\nYou need to justify your answer. (6 points)\nIn part (a), you'll find that the cost goes down with a smaller h. However, h is limited by the\nmanufacturing process and the pressure drop requirement of the catalyst.\nThe catalyst is sized to get the targeted conversion efficiency at maximum power, which closely\ncorresponds to the maximum exhaust mass flow rate. Do the following analysis for a modern engine\nwith the following specifications.\nCatalyst:\nCeramic monolith with 600 cpsi (cells per square inch), and a wall\nthickness of 0.2 mm. The frontal area is a 15 by 9 cm ellipse (of area =\n117.8 cm2). Catalyst operates at 800K and 1 bar.\nEngine:\n120 kW gasoline SI engine at =1; fuel conversion efficiency = 32%;\nexhaust gas molecular weight = 29\nOther useful properties:\nfuel LHV = 44 MJ/kg; universal gas constant = 8314 J/kmol-K\nThe targeted efficiency for reducing propane (a surrogate for the hydrocarbons) is 99.7%. The\ndiffusivity of propane in exhaust gas at 800K and 1 bar is 5.63x10-5 m2/s.\n(b) What is the exhaust mass flow rate? (2 points)\n(c) What is the flow velocity inside the channels of the catalyst? (2 points)\n(d) What is the minimum length of the catalyst to attain the targeted catalyst efficiency? (2 points)\n(e) The exhaust gas viscosity at 1 bar and 800K is 3.6x10-5 kg/m-s. Calculate the Reynolds number\nof the flow in the catalyst. You should find that the flow should be in the laminar regime with the\nfriction coefficient f = 64/Re.\nWhat is the pressure drop through the catalyst? (The pressure drop is 0.5U2f(L/h). Note that the\npressure drop can be reduced by having a bigger frontal area.)

      "content": "2.61 Final solution\nProblem 1\n\nProblem 2\n\n(a) The EXPAD technology will reduce the piston sliding friction power consumption. Because of the high piston\nspeed, the mid stroke is in the hydrodynamic lubrication regime. The rubber pad provides insulation of the\nliner from the coolant so that the mid-section of the liner runs hotter. The viscosity of the lubrication oil\ndecreases exponentially with temperature. The hydrodynamic friction is reduced with the lower viscosity. For\nthe top and bottom part of the liner where the piston speed is low, the liner is not insulated by the EXPAD. So\nthe temperature is controlled by the coolant, and the viscosity is kept high with the lower temperature to\nminimize mixed and boundary lubrication.\n(b) For high BMEP engine with large bore (B), the force on the piston is very high (force BMEP*B2). Also the\nwall temperature will be high because of the high load; the viscosity of the lubricant on the liner will\ncorrespondingly be low. For a normal piston arrangement, the high side force will break through the oil film\n(with low viscosity) for a substantial range of the stroke, resulting in high wear and high friction.\n\nWith a cross head, because the connecting rod is normal to the combustion chamber piston face, the side force\nof the piston is small. So even with the low lubricant viscosity in the combustion chamber due to the high\ntemperature, the lubrication film will be able to support the piston for a substantial part of the stroke. For the\ndriving piston, the side force is high. However, the lubrication film is now outside the combustion chamber so\nthat the temperature is low; correspondingly the viscosity is much higher. Then the oil film will be able to\nsupport the high side force of the piston.\n(c) To have the turbine extracting much of the charge energy, the exhaust valve is opened early so that the high\npressure cylinder charge is discharged through the turbine. Since the extraction of work via the turbine and that\nvia the piston are the same thermodynamic process, there is no material difference in the output work in\nprinciple. Note that the turbine exit pressures for both the regular configuration and the one with the extra\npower turbine are the same. With the same work going to drive the compressor, the combine work extraction\nwith the power turbine and the limited expansion stroke is the same as that with the normal expansion stroke.\n\nIn practice, however, the flow loss through the valve is much higher because of the higher density exhaust with\nthe early EVO.\n\nThe heat transfer loss is also much higher due to the higher temperature high speed flow through the valve and\nport. Because high surface area of the blade surfaces, the heat transfer loss in the power turbine is much larger\nthan that in a piston engine.\n\nThe overall fuel conversion efficiency will be lower than the regular engine, and the cost will be higher because\nof the extra hardware.\n(d) When the combustion is retarded, the expansion will take less work out of the charge and the exhaust gas will\nbe hotter.\n\nWith the combustion retard, to maintain the same torque output to overcome engine friction in the idle process,\nthe throughput of the engine has to increase. Thus the exhaust gas mass flow rate increases.\n\nBoth effects (higher temperature and higher gas flow rate) accelerate the catalyst light off.\n(e) The longer expansion stroke extracts more work out of the charge. The fuel conversion efficiency improves.\n\nThe shorter compression stroke implies that less charge is trapped. So the torque output decreases.\n(f) With some of the cylinders deactivated, the remaining cylinders operate at a higher load for the same total\noutput torque. Thus the pumping loss is reduced.\n\nThe deactivated cylinders should have the valves closed. Then heat transfer and friction are the only significant\nlosses. These losses are much less than the pumping loss of the gas flowing in and out of the cylinder if the\nvalves are not closed.\n\nTIw.. t~ IJ-,tl.\n.(\nL ': [-,- (t-\" )J--.! .0\n-I(\nt.cA\"\ntJ(\nri.. ~ ;'flu. l41;~ .;\nu>:' ';\"f I.HtJ f :: ~\nLl{v ~\n('t''1,) ..\n,.;::\n, (If' 'IF)\n~\n'1 IHv\nT'\" uIl ~jt ~ 1.'= ( ;;~r~'~~l~:i~ ~ ~.1}~\n1t... rt-.J ~ -I. 1.'-t\n\" \":!Jj,!:.\nflv. wi.( J-ai...\n~ ~ (filer)\"\"\n-oJ 1:~\nTt.... tL ~ rl4W~\nIJ ::\nttL\n~\nII .; t4f ~J ~\n;A.(\n... rf-)\n\"\n~Y (/St t\" ~.f/..) -(-fJ\nfU. 1 ()I.....J.\nr\nJ:f-/\"1.1.\n.J: ~,\n~....,... ,. leI-.J ~II\n.\n/\n't::\n-=- -\nt ec -l. !:}r{f.)

      "content": "2.61 Internal Combustion Engine\nFinal Examination\nOpen book. Note that Problems 1 &2 carry 20 points each; Problems 3 &4 carry 10 points each.\nProblem 1 (20 points)\nEthanol has been introduced as the bio-fuel entry to the transportation fuel market. We are to assess the\ncharge cooling effect when ethanol is used in a 4-stroke direct injection spark ignition engine. Because of\ncold start consideration, E85 (which is 85% ethanol to 15% gasoline by volume) is used in practice. To\nsimplify the problem, however, we'll compare the use of neat ethanol (i.e. E100) to gasoline (E0).\nThe gasoline has H to C ratio of 1.85, with an averaged molecular weight of 110, and latent heat of\nvaporization of 305 kJ/kg.\nEthanol is C2H5OH, with a molecular weight of 46 and latent heat of vaporization of 840 kJ/kg.\nFor both engines, injection takes place during the intake stroke. To simplify the problem, assume that at\nIVC, all the fuel has evaporated and mixed with air to form a homogeneous trapped charge, and the\nengine speed is sufficiently low so that the cylinder pressure at IVC is equal to the manifold absolute\npressure (MAP). Furthermore:\n- for the E0 engine, 30% of the liquid fuel lands on the wall and then evaporates (so that the latent\nheat is supplied by the wall), and 70% of the fuel evaporates in flight, thereby cooling the air;\n- for the E100 engine, 50% of the liquid lands on the wall and then evaporates and 50% of the fuel\nevaporates in flight.\nBoth the E0 and E100 engines are operating at stoichiometric A/F. You may also neglect the residual gas.\na) Using the ideal gas law, show that the trapped mass of air ma per cycle is\nMAP *V\nma\n(If you do not finish this part, just use the formula for the rest of the problem)\nF / A\nT\n\nWa\nWf\n\nwhere V and T are the volume and temperature of the trapped charge at intake-valve-closing; Wa and\nWf are the molecular weights of the air and the fuel, the universal gas constant, and F/A is the fuel\nto air ratio. Identify the cooling effect and the fuel vapor displacement-of-the-air effect.\nb) To assess the displacement effect only: if the trapped charge temperature are the same, what would be\nthe ratio of ma for the engine using E100 and using E0?\nc) The trapped charge temperature T will be different with the two fuels. What are the temperature\ndrops, for using the two fuels due to evaporative cooling? In this calculation, since the mass of\nfuel is small compared to that of the air, you may assume that the fuel does not contribute significantly\nto the sensible energy of the charge except for the latent heat of vaporization. The specific heat at\nconstant pressure for the air is 103 J/kg-K\nd) If the temperature of the charge without accounting for the evaporative cooling (i.e. the T in part c)\nis 40oC (313K), what is the ratio of ma for using the two fuels when both the fuel vapor displacement\nand the charge cooling effects are accounted for?\ne) If the end gas for both fuels follows a polytropic efficiency n=1.32 (i.e. pVn=constant), what are the\nend gas temperatures for using the two fuels when the MAP is 1 bar and the end gas pressure is at 80\nbar?\n\nProblem 2 (20 points)\nAn effective way to improve the engine efficiency is to turbo-charge-downsize the engine. Then at part-\nload, the engine works at a higher load point so that the pumping loss is less and the parasitic losses (heat\ntransfer, rubbing friction, ....) relative to the fuel energy are reduced. We are to look at the scaling law of\nthe parasitic losses with respect to the size of the engine.\nAll engine geometric dimensions (such as stroke, clearance height, piston skirt, ...), with the exception of\nthe piston rings, scale with the bore (B). The ring thickness (h), however, remains unchanged as the engine\nsize changes.\nWe are to compare engines with different values of B operating at the same speed (N revolution/sec) and\ntorque ( ) output. As the engine is downsized (decreasing B) at the same , the engine will be running at\na higher MEP. However, it could be assumed that the charge temperature in the cycle is approximately the\nsame since the higher heat release rate per unit volume at the higher load is counter-acted by the higher\nthermal mass per unit volume.\n(a) We'll consider the heat transfer scaling. The engine heat transfer is governed by the Nusselt number\ncorrelation\nNu = a Re0.8\nwhere a is a proportional constant. The Reynolds number Re is based on the mean piston speed and B.\nThe Nusselt number Nu is based on B. Both the kinematic viscosity and thermal conductivity k of\nthe working fluid may be considered as unchanged since the cycle temperature does not change\nappreciably with the downsizing ( and k are not sensitive to pressure).\nHow does the heat transfer per cycle Q scale with B?\n(b) The top ring friction is considered here. The reciprocating friction is dominated by the hydrodynamic\npart of the motion. The hydrodynamic frictional coefficient f is proportional to the square root of the\nSommerfeld number S defined by\nU\nS\nL\nR Rh\nwhere L , the viscosity of the lubricant, may be considered unchanged since the cycle temperature is\napproximately the same. The velocity U is the mean piston speed; h is the ring thickness, and the normal\nstress R on the ring is due to the pushing of the ring against the liner by the cylinder pressure.\nHow does the top ring frictional work done per cycle scale with B?\n(c) The piston skirt friction is considered here. Again the friction is dominated by the hydrodynamic part\nof the motion with the frictional coefficient governed by the Sommerfeld number SS similar to that in\npart (b).\nLU\nSS SH\nHowever, the length scale is now H, the skirt height, which scales with B, and the normal stress S is\nnow due to the pushing of the connecting rod on the piston against the liner.\nHow does the piston skirt frictional work per cycle scale with B?\n\nProblem 3 (10 points)\nIn many of the severe knock occurrences, there is substantial damage to the top land of the piston because\nthe knock-induced shock wave in the combustion chamber enters the top land crevice and detonates the fuel\nair mixture there; see picture.\n(i)\nExplain why detonating the top land crevice gas would produce more damage than detonating the\ncombustion chamber mixture?\n(ii)\nFor a typical piston top land crevice geometry (land height = 6mm; piston/liner clearance = 150 m),\nand wall temperature of 500K, if the pressure of the crevice gas is 40 bar just prior to the detonation,\nestimate the crevice pressure induced by the detonation for an engine operating at =1 and with\nnegligible residual gas. The crevice gas (both burned and unburned) may be modelled as an ideal gas\nwith = 1.32 and molecular weight of 29. (Hint: apply 1st Law of thermodynamics to the crevice gas,\nand note that cv=RT/( -1) ).\n(c) Source unknown. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our Creative\nCommons license. For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n\nProblem 4 (10 points)\nYou are asked a venture capital firm to evaluate a proposed engine technology; see below. (The materials\nare from a real company in US, and could be downloaded from the web at http://www.scuderigroup.com/.)\nThe basic concept of the engine is a split cycle; i.e. the engine uses a separate cylinder for compression and\nexpansion. At the end of the compression stroke, the compressed charge is transferred from the compressor\nto the expander through the crossover passage. The timing of the transfer is controlled by the transfer\nvalves. The fuel can either be injected in the intake, or in the crossover passage. The combustion takes\nplace in the expander.\nMake 5 technical comments about this technology. Each comment can either be positive or negative\nrespectively, but these comments should be based on sound physical principles.\n(c) Scuderi Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

Then the losses (a), (b) and (c) go down with\nthe engine size B.\n\nPiston crevice knock\n\n(i)\nDetonation is more severe in the piston crevice gas is because the gas there is denser (due to the\nlower crevice gas temperature) than the combustion chamber gas.

For ideal gas, applying the first law\n\nProblem 3 solution\n\nProblem 4: Split cycle engine\n\nAdvantages:\ni.\nThe splitting of the intake/compression and expansion/exhaust strokes to be performed by two\nindependent cylinders enables one to have a higher expansion ratio than compression ratio. The\nhigh expansion ratio gives higher fuel conversion efficiency. Note that the bore of the expansion\ncylinder could be larger than that of the compression one; hence larger can be made large\nwithout going to longer stroke. This feature makes the packaging of the engine easier (do not have\nto have a tall engine).\nii.\nLower compression ratio (at the same expansion ratio) allows lower NOx emissions.\niii.\nLower compression ratio also prevents knocking.\niv.\nThe transfer of the charge into the expansion cylinder is just before ignition. Hence the turbulence\ngenerated by the fluid motion has little time to decay. The high turbulence promotes combustion\nspeed.\nDisadvantages\nv.\nSubstantial pumping loss in the valves and crossover passage in the charge transfer process. The\nloss is especially severe at high speed and high load.\nvi.\nDitto for heat transfer loss.\nvii.\nThe air intake is determined by the sweep volume of the intake/compression cylinder. Have to\nturbo-charge to increase power.\nviii.\nThe valve stem seal for the two transfer valves must sustain the compression pressure and\ntemperature. The tradeoff between leakage and friction is difficult.\nix.\nBecause ignition is in the expansion cylinder, ignition timing is essentially at or after TDC. Since\nthe heat release is not instantaneous, the later combustion partly negates the effect of (ii) and\nefficiency suffers.\nx.\nIf the fuel is injected in the crossover passage, there is not sufficient time for evaporation and\nmixing. So the charge will be inhomogeneous. There will be soot formation in the locally fuel\nrich region.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n2.61 Internal Combustion Engines\nSpring 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "2.61 Internal Combustion Engine\nQuiz 3/16/2017 -- Open book\nProblem 1 (10 points)\nThe engine map for a passenger car is shown in the\naccompanying figure. (It is the Toyota 3 liter, 6\ncylinder SI engine for the Camry vehicle.) The\nvehicle specifications are:\nVehicle weight with passengers= 1500 kg\nFrontal width x height = 1.8m x 1.5 m\nGear ratios:\n1st\n3.60\n2nd\n1.88\n3rd\n1.19\n4th\n0.84\n5th\n0.64\nFinal drive\n3.89\nEngine map of Toyota 1MZ-FE 3 liter-6 cylinder\nengine. The engine is for the Camry vehicle.\nThe overall gear ratio is the product of the gear\nratio and the final drive ratio.\nTire is P205/55R16; tire diameter = 0.63 m.\nDrag coefficient of the vehicle is 0.3\nAmbient air density is 1.2 kg/m3\nThe coefficient of rolling friction is 0.015\nThe drive system transmission efficiency is 0.85.\nOther useful numbers:\nDensity of gasoline fuel = 0.78x103 kg/m3; heating value = 44 MJ/kg; 1 gallon = 3.785 L\nConsider vehicle operation on a level road cruising at 65 mph (29.1 m/s) at 5th gear.\n1. What are the engine speed and brake mean effective pressure (BMEP)?\n2. Locate the operating point on the engine map. What are the specific fuel consumption in g/kW-hr,\nand gas mileage in miles per gallon?\n3. Cylinder deactivation technology is applied to dynamically reconfigure the engine from a 6-cylinder/\n3 liter to a 3-cylinder/1.5L one under this cruise condition. Assuming the engine BMEP map is the\nsame for the new engine configuration, what are the specific fuel consumption (g/kW-hr) and gas\nmileage (mpg)? (In practice, the friction of the 3-cylinder engine will be higher because the 3\nactivated cylinders have to drive the 3 deactivated cylinders.)\n4. Explain where the gain in efficiency comes from.\n\nProblem 2 (10 points)\nThere are a lot of \"stranded\" natural gas; i.e. natural gas in areas where delivery of the gas to the market is\nnot feasible. For example, in oil fields in remote areas, natural gas is discovered together with the oil.\nThe gas is difficult to be transported because of its low density (compared to a liquid fuel) so that the gas\nis either flare off or pumped back into the ground. A solution to utilize this natural gas is to convert it to\nmethanol, a liquid, which can then be readily transported.\nThe first step in the conversion process is to produce synthesis gas (a mixture of CO and H2) from which\nmethanol can be synthesized. The process is exothermic. A proposed scheme is to use an internal\ncombustion engine to process the gas under fuel rich condition to produce the synthesis gas. Then the\nmechanical energy extracted by the engine is used to run the conversion plant.\nThe engine is to be run at significantly fuel rich condition (<1). The exhaust is a mixture of CO, CO2,\nH2, H2O and N2. The species composition corresponds to the equilibrium composition of the water gas\nshift reaction at 1900K. (This temperature is higher than the conventional value at 1740K because of the\nvery rich condition.) The water gas shift reaction is H CO\n\nCO\n\nH O\n\nThe measured CO to CO2 molar ratio is\n3:1 in the exhaust. To simplify the\nanalysis, the natural gas is assumed to be\npure methane (CH4). The heat of\nformations and equilibrium constants for\nthe individual species are shown in the\naccompanying table.\n(a) What is the equilibrium constant at\n1900K for the water gas shift reaction?\nSpecies\nf\nh\n(MJ/kmol)\nLog10Kp\n@1900K\nCH4\n-74.9\n-3.281\nCO2 (gas)\n-393.5\n10.898\nCO (gas)\n-110.5\n7.631\nH2O (gas)\n-241,8\n3.886\nH2 (gas)\nN2 (gas)\n(b) For each mole of CH4, how many\nmoles each of CO, CO2, H2 and H2O\nare produced in the exhaust? (Hint: the\nexhaust gas is frozen with the thermal equilibrium composition at 1900K)\n(c) What is the air equivalence ratio ()?\n(d) What is the heat of reaction (i.e. energy released in converting the reactants to products at 298K and 1\natmosphere, with the H2O in vapor state) per kmol of CH4 consumed?\n(e) The lower heating value for CH4 is 50MJ/kg. What is the combustion efficiency of the engine?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n2.61 Internal Combustion Engines\nSpring 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Lenoir.\n― Key concept: Combustion increases temperature and gas\nexpands. Expanding gas drives piston to produce mechanical\nenergy.\n― Modified steam energy; no compression\n― Operated at 10 cycles/min; efficiency <5% because of low\neffective compression ratio\nSold 500 of them\nAtmospheric free piston engine\nNicolaus Otto and Eugene Langen\n― Key concept: still no compression, but use the inertia of a\nheavy piston to over-expand the combustion gas to below\natmosphere, thereby increasing the expansion ratio. Output\nmechanical work stored as gravitational potential energy in\nheavy piston first, and then extracted by clutching piston to\nfly wheel on downward stroke.\n― Larger expansion ratio: efficiency increased to 11%\n― Operate at 28 cycles/minute\n― Used a flame ignitor through a sliding window\nSold 5000, dominated market for 10 years until introduction of\nthe 4-stroke engine\n4-stroke engine\nNicolaus Otto\n2-stroke engine\nDougald Clerk\nCompression Ignition 4-stroke\nRudolf Diesel\n― Key concepts: prevent the very rapid and high pressure heat\n\nprocess via introducing fuel late in the cycle; compression\nignition\n― Concept developed by the company MAN\n― Diesel was in heavy debt, and jumped off a ship.\n1870's\nDevelopment of the Petroleum\nIndustry\n1900's\nSpark plug dominated the market of\nignition devices\nSpark plug was invented by Edmond Berger in 1839. Albert\nChampion was the most successful manufacturer.\n1920's\nICE dominated the market of\nautomotive power plant\nMain reason for not using the steam engine for vehicles was that\ntoo much water was needed.\n1920's\nTetra-ethyl lead as anti-knock agent\nThomas Midgley, under the direction of Carles Kettering at GM\nfound the compound to suppress knock after extensive search.\nWith leaded gasoline, maximum compression ratio was raised\nfrom 5 to 9, and engine efficiency increased substantially\nSteady development\n1960's\nVehicle emissions became an issue\nSmog mechanism was discovered by Haagen Smit\n1970's\nOil embargo; energy crisis\n1980's\nStart of global competition\n1980's\nCatalytic converter and unleaded\ngasoline\nThe 3 way catalyst reduced emissions of CO, HC and NOx by\nmore than an order of magnitude, and was the enabler for the\nvehicles to meet emissions regulations\n1990's\nRecognition of importance of green\nhouse gas\n2000's\nTowards sustainable transportation\nGas exchange process of 4- and 2-stroke engines\nSee figures 1-2 and 1-3.\n― 2-stroke engine theoretically has twice the power density of 2-stroke engine; in practice, the ratio is about 1.4\n(value larger for low speed turbo-charger engines) because of incompleteness of scavenging.\n― For effective scavenging of the 2-stroke, there will be excess air in the exhaust, and the 3-way catalyst would\nnot work. Therefore 2-stroke SI engine would not be able to meet the stringent emission regulations\nEngine pressure traces\nSee Fig. 1.8 and 1.15 for SI and Compression Ignition engines\n― Pressure measurement is an important diagnostic because it is directly related to the mechanical energy output\nof the engine (Torque = P dV/d, where is the crank angle); furthermore, interpretation of pressure is\nunambiguous since it is uniform in the cylinder (except in knocking), whereas temperature is not.\n― Empirically for most efficient operation, peak pressure for SI engine is at 14-17o CA-ATC; for diesel is at 7-10o\nCA-ATC.\n― The very rapid pressure rise in the beginning of diesel combustion is the cause of the diesel noise.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n2.61 Internal Combustion Engines\nSpring 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The non\nuniform pressure distribution causes strong pressure waves or\nshock waves to propagate across and excites the acoustic modes\nof the combustion chamber.\nWhen the fuel-air mixture in the end-gas region is compressed to\nsufficiently high pressures and temperatures, the fuel oxidation\nprocess ― starting with the pre-flame chemistry and ending with\nrapid heat release ― can occur spontaneously in parts or all of the\nend-gas region.\nMost evidence indicates that knock originates with the auto\nignition of one or more local regions within the end-gas.\nAdditional regions then ignite until the end-gas is essentially fully\nreacted. The sequence of processes occur extremely rapidly.\n\nKnock chemical mechanism\nCHAIN BRANCHING EXPLOSION\nChemical reactions lead to increasing number of radicals,\nwhich leads to rapidly increasing reaction rates\nFormation of Branching Agents\nChain Propagation\nHO\nR\nO\nRH\nChain Initiation\n\nDegenerate Branching\nR O\nR CHO\nRO\nR\nROOH\nRH\nRO\n\nR O2 RO , etc.\n\nROOH\nOH\nRO\n\nO\nR CHO\n\nHO\nR CO\n\nIgnition delay for primary reference fuels\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n0.1\n1200 1100\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n0.1\n1200 1100 1000\nIgn delay (ms)\n1000/T[k]\nON=0 60\n(Adapted from data of\nFieweger et al, C&F 109)\nP = 40 bar\nT(oK)\nRange of interest\n\nIgnition delay kinetics\nPropagation\nDegenerate\n\nBranching\nR O\n\n2 RO\n\nLow\nRO2 ROOH (Isomerization)\n\nO=ROOH O=R O OH\ntemperature\n\nROOH O OOROOH\nNTC regime\n\nOOROOH O=ROOH OH\nTemperature high\nenough to shift\nInitiation\nBranching agent (hydroperoxyl carbonyl species)\nRH O2\nformation of RO2 to\n\nH2O2, but not high\nDegenerate\nenough for H2O2\nR HO\n\nPropagation\n\nBranching\ndecomposition\n\nH O M OH OH M\nRH HO 2\n\nH O\nR\nHigh\n\ntemperature\nHO2 HO2\n\nH O\nM\nM\n\nBranching agent (hydrogen peroxide)\nLivengood and Wu integral\ntign\ndt\np(t),T(t)\n5th Combustion Symposium, 1954\n(c) Elsevier, Inc.

Part-throttle knock is a\ntransient phenomenon and is a nuisance to the driver.\n2.\nWhether or not knock occurs depends on engine/fuel/vehicle\nfactors and ambient conditions (temperature, humidity). This\nmakes it a complex phenomenon.\n3.\nTo avoid knock with gasoline, the engine compression ratio is\nlimited to approximately 12.5 in PFI engines and 13.5 in DISI\nengines. Significant efficiency gains are possible if the\ncompression ratio could be raised. (Approximately, increasing\nCR by 1 increases efficiency by one percentage point.)\n4.\nFeedback control of spark timing using a knock sensor is used\nso that SI engine can operate close to its knock limit.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n2.61 Internal Combustion Engines\nSpring 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
