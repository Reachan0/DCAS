  "course_description": "The MIT Biology Department core courses, 7.012, 7.013, and 7.014, all cover the same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. Biological function at the molecular level is particularly emphasized and covers the structure and regulation of genes, as well as, the structure and synthesis of proteins, how these molecules are integrated into cells, and how these cells are integrated into multicellular systems and organisms. In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material.\n7.012 focuses on the exploration of current research in cell biology, immunology, neurobiology, genomics, and molecular medicine.\nAcknowledgments\nThe study materials, problem sets, and quiz materials used during Fall 2004 for 7.012 include contributions from past instructors, teaching assistants, and other members of the MIT Biology Department affiliated with course #7.012. Since the following works have evolved over a period of many years, no single source can be attributed.",

  "syllabus_content": "Prerequisites\n\nThere are no formal prerequisites for this course, but we do presuppose high school-level biology and chemistry (especially familiarity with the fundamental aspects of chemical structure).\n\nPrior to taking this course, you may want to review\nPre-7.01 Getting up to Speed in Biology\n, a self-paced course designed to help prepare students for their first college-level biology class.\n\nText\n\nFreeman, Scott.\nBiological Science\n. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002. ISBN: 9780130819239.\n\nSpencer, Charlotte A.\nGenetic Testimony: a Guide to Forensic DNA Profiling\n. San Francisco, CA: Benjamin Cummings, 2003. ISBN: 9780131423381.\n\nRecitations\n\nRegular weekly attendance is expected. Each recitation section meets twice per week for 50 minutes.\n\nTutors\n\nTutors are available at no charge for all students who wish to have extra help with the course material, either on a one-time or on a regular basis.\n\nVoluntary Laboratory\n\nThis semester is the second time we are offering a voluntary lab component as an exciting addition to 7.012.\n\nThe purpose of the labs is to give you a hands-on experience with the organisms, equipment, techniques, and thought process used by molecular biologists. You will have the opportunity to do experiments for yourselves, and a chance to learn the concepts that are addressed in lecture and section from a different angle. Experiments will include:\n\nIsolating your own DNA\n\nGenerating and Finding Mutant Yeast\n\nPerforming Gene Therapy on Mutant Yeast\n\nSetting up Yeast Matings\n\nScreening Household Products for Carcinogens\n\nAssignments\n\nThere are six problem sets for this course. Of the six graded problem sets, the lowest grade is dropped in calculating your final grade (see below). The last problem set, Problem Set 7, will not be graded, however, the material on this problem set will be covered on the Final Exam. Although you may engage in general discussions of problems, sharing of answers is a violation of the trust placed in all students in the class, each of whom is entrusted with producing her/his own set of answers. Students who copy problem set answers or allow their problem sets to be copied may receive a 0 for all the Problem Sets (and thus lose 20% of the grade).\n\nCompleted problem sets must be put in the appropriate TA's box in the wooden cart by the due date/time.\n\nNote: Problem sets will not be accepted late and will be scored ZERO points if not turned in on time.\n\nExams\n\nThree quizzes and a final exam are given in this course. The quizzes are given during the term and a comprehensive final (worth 2 quizzes), given during finals week.\n\nEach of the term quizzes will take place in at least two locations, on the dates listed in the syllabus. See Quiz handouts for room assignments. The lowest letter grade score of the five (the 3 quizzes plus the final worth 2 quizzes) will be dropped when calculating your overall grade. Because we drop the lowest score, there will be\nno make-up quizzes\nand\nno conflict quizzes\ngiven for any reason. If you miss a term quiz, it will be the score that is dropped.\n\nThe Final Exam is a 3-hour, cumulative exam, covering the entirety of the course. The score on the final exam will be halved and each half counts as a quiz score when calculating your grade. The final represents two of the five quiz scores and\nmust be taken\n, otherwise you lose 20% of your grade. If your score on the final is your lowest grade then one of the halves will be dropped.\n\nThe date, time, and location of the final will be announced as soon as this information is available. A\nconflict final exam may be scheduled\nby the registrar for students with legitimate exam conflicts.\n\nQuiz Review Sessions\nwill be held prior to each quiz - the dates, locations and times of the reviews will be announced during the term.\n\nAny quizzes, exams, or problem sets that are not picked up by the end of the term will be disposed of.\n\nGrades\n\nACtivities\n\npercentages\n\nnotes\n\n5 of 6 Graded Problem Sets\n\n20%\n\nLowest of 6 problem set scores dropped\n\n4 of 5 Quizzes\n\n80%\n\nLowest grade of \"five\" quizzes dropped (3 one-hour quizzes during term plus the 2 quiz scores derived from the Final Exam, whose score will be divided in two, each half counting as one quiz score)",

(A diagram of each\nmolecule may help.)\nEthanol is a polar molecule because there is a partial charge separation associated with the bond\nbetween the hydrogen and the oxygen. The higher electronegativity of oxygen pulls the electrons\nin the bond closer to the oxygen resulting in a greater electron density around the oxygen. This\nprovides a slight negative charge for the oxygen and a slight positive charge for the carbon. The\nmolecule is polar because these opposite charges are separated at the two ends of the bond.\nEthane, on the other hand, is nonpolar because there are no such charge separations present in\nthis molecule.

When glucose is absent, galactose is MOSTLY used to make energy, but a little\nis used to make the cell wall. The enzymes for the conversion of galactose into a cell wall\ncomponent are transcribed as an operon. The operon is transcribed at a high level when\nglucose is present and at a low level when glucose is absent. In many organisms, this type\nof regulation is accomplished by having two promoters in front of the operon, one that is\n\"strong\", meaning it causes a high level of transcription, and one that is \"weak\", meaning it\ncauses a low level of transcription. In this problem, we will be learning how the\ntranscriptional regulation of this type of operon occurs.\nYou isolate mutants that do not respond appropriately to the presence or absence of\nglucose, as summarized below. Assume each mutant has a single point mutation.\nAssume all mutations are disabling. The repressor is under its own promoter, and\nthis promoter is not affected by any of the mutations.\nGalactose incorporation into cell wall\nstrain\n+ Glucose\n- Glucose\nWild type\nHigh\nLow\nMutant 1\nHigh\nHigh\nMutant 2\nHigh\nHigh\nMutant 3\nLow\nLow\nMutant 4\nNone\nNone\nMutant 5\nHigh\nNone\nMutant 6\nNone\nNone\na) Which mutant(s) could have a mutation in either promoter? Keep in mind what the\nphenotypes of the mutants would be if there were both a strong promoter and a weak promoter.\n________________\nb) Which mutant(s) could have a mutation in an operator? ______________________\nc) In a repressor? ______________________\nd) In a protein coding region? ____________________\n\nPart II\nTo determine which elements are cis-acting and which are trans-acting, you consruct E. coli that is diploid\nfor the DNA encoding this operon (merodiploid), and observe how the mutations behave.\nIn this problem, the mutant number will correspond to the element that contains the mutation. An element\nin this problem can be a gene, promoter, operator, or a repressor. For example, mutant 6 would have an\nmutation in element 6. If the data indicated that mutant 6 has a mutation in an operator, then for part i)\nbelow, that operator would be numbered 6.\nMeasuring the activity of galactose incorporation into the cell wall, you observe the following results. A \"+\"\nmeans that the element corresponding to a particular mutant is wild type, whereas a \"-\" means that the\nelement is mutated. For example, 3- 2+ means the DNA sequence has a mutation in element 3, is wild type\nin element 2, and all other parts of the operon and its regulatory elements are present and wild type on\nboth DNA copies.\nIncorporation of Galactose into cell wall\nStrain\n+ Glucose\n- Glucose\nHigh\nLow\nLow\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\nNone\nHigh\nLow\n_________________\na) Which elements are cis-acting?\n_________________\nb) Which elements are trans-acting?\n_________________\nc) Which element is the strong promoter?\n_________________\nd) Which element is the weak promoter?\n_________________\ne) Which element is the operator?\n_________________\nf) Which promoter does it regulate?\n_________________\ng) Which element is the repressor?\n_________________\nh) How many proteins are encoded by this operon?\ni) Draw a picture of this operon, with numbers corresponding to the elements identified\nby the mutant strains.

Also place the number corresponding to the repressor in the box\ndepicting its gene drawn below.\n2- 4+ 6+\n2+ 4- 6-\n5- 4+ 6+\n5+ 4- 6-\n1- 4+ 6+\n1+ 4- 6-\n3- 4+ 6+\n3+ 4- 6-\n4- 6+\n4+ 6-\nRepressor\n\nQuestion 4\nYou are studying several compounds (A, B, C, D, and E) that were shown to affect expression of\nsecreted proteins in canine kidney cells. You've established an experimental system by fusing a\nsignal sequence to green fluorescent protein (GFP) that you've introduced into canine cells. With\nthis fusion in the strain, you'll be able to measure green fluorescence in the growth medium after\nremoval of the cells. Your goal is to determine how each compound affects expression of the GFP\ngene fusion. To this end you assay individual cell cultures treated with each of your compounds in\nthe following ways.\nYou measure fluorescence in the medium.\n°All cultures treated individually with each compound fail to show fluorescence in the medium.\nUntreated cultures exhibit fluorescence in medium.\nYou measure intracellular GFP mRNA.\n°The mRNA is detected in all of your cultures except the one treated with compound A.\nYou fractionate intracellular subcompartments and assay for the presence of GFP mRNA.\n°After separating the cytoplasmic fractions from the nuclear fractions of the cells, you fail to\ndetect GFP mRNA in the cytoplasm of cells treated with compound B.\nYou observe the cells under a fluorescent microscope.\n°You fail to see fluorescence in cells treated with compound C.\n°You see GFP fluorescence within the cytoplasm of cells treated with compound D.\n°You see GFP fluorescence within the endoplasmic reticulum of cells treated with compound E.\nYour advisor is able to continue this molecular analysis that will precisely determine the gene\nexpression defect caused by each compound, but this research is expensive. You got a D in 7.012\nlast semester and the only way you can get into Harvard Medical School is to rise to the occasion\nand shine by accurately predicting how each compound affects gene expression. This will ensure\nyour name on a publication of this research project. Your advisor awaits your hypotheses.\na) What is the most likely mechanism affected by compound A to halt GFP expression in\nyour canine cells?\nb) What process is affected by compound B? Why would this prevent secretion of GFP?\nc) What process is affected by compound C?\nd) Give an example of what might be a target for compound D.\ne) What process is affected by compound E?"

In this problem, we will be learning how the\ntranscriptional regulation of this type of operon occurs.\nYou isolate mutants that do not respond appropriately to the presence or absence of\nglucose, as summarized below. Assume each mutant has a single point mutation.\nAssume all mutations are disabling. The repressor is under its own promoter, and\nthis promoter is not affected by any of the mutations.\nGalactose incorporation into cell wall\nstrain\n+ Glucose\n- Glucose\nWild type\nHigh\nLow\nMutant 1\nHigh\nHigh\nMutant 2\nHigh\nHigh\nMutant 3\nLow\nLow\nMutant 4\nNone\nNone\nMutant 5\nHigh\nNone\nMutant 6\nNone\nNone\na) Which mutant(s) could have a mutation in either promoter?

An element\nin this problem can be a gene, promoter, operator, or a repressor. For example, mutant 6 would have an\nmutation in element 6. If the data indicated that mutant 6 has a mutation in an operator, then for part i)\nbelow, that operator would be numbered 6.\nMeasuring the activity of galactose incorporation into the cell wall, you observe the following results. A \"+\"\nmeans that the element corresponding to a particular mutant is wild type, whereas a \"-\" means that the\nelement is mutated. For example, 3- 2+ means the DNA sequence has a mutation in element 3, is wild type\nin element 2, and all other parts of the operon and its regulatory elements are present and wild type on\nboth DNA copies.\nIncorporation of Galactose into cell wall\nStrain\n+ Glucose\n- Glucose\nHigh\nLow\nLow\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\nNone\nHigh\nLow\n________1,3,5_____\na) Which elements are cis-acting?\n______2,4,6_______\nb) Which elements are trans-acting?\n_______3______\nc) Which element is the strong promoter?\n_______5______\nd) Which element is the weak promoter?\n_______1______\ne) Which element is the operator?\n_______3______\nf) Which promoter does it regulate?\n_______2______\ng) Which element is the repressor?\n_______2______\nh) How many proteins are encoded by this operon?\ni) Draw a picture of this operon, with numbers corresponding to the elements identified\nby the mutant strains.

You've established an experimental system by fusing a\nsignal sequence to green fluorescent protein (GFP) that you've introduced into canine cells. With\nthis fusion in the strain, you'll be able to measure green fluorescence in the growth medium after\nremoval of the cells. Your goal is to determine how each compound affects expression of the GFP\ngene fusion. To this end you assay individual cell cultures treated with each of your compounds in\nthe following ways.\nYou measure fluorescence in the medium.\n°All cultures treated individually with each compound fail to show fluorescence in the medium.\nUntreated cultures exhibit fluorescence in medium.\nYou measure intracellular GFP mRNA.\n°The mRNA is detected in all of your cultures except the one treated with compound A.\nYou fractionate intracellular subcompartments and assay for the presence of GFP mRNA.\n°After separating the cytoplasmic fractions from the nuclear fractions of the cells, you fail to\ndetect GFP mRNA in the cytoplasm of cells treated with compound B.\nYou observe the cells under a fluorescent microscope.\n°You fail to see fluorescence in cells treated with compound C.\n°You see GFP fluorescence only within the cytoplasm of cells treated with compound D.\n°You see GFP fluorescence only within the endoplasmic reticulum of cells treated with compound E.\nYour advisor is able to continue this molecular analysis that will precisely determine the gene\nexpression defect caused by each compound, but this research is expensive. You got a D in 7.012\nlast semester and the only way you can get into Harvard Medical School is to rise to the occasion\nand shine by accurately predicting how each compound affects gene expression. This will ensure\nyour name on a publication of this research project. Your advisor awaits your hypotheses.\na) What is the most likely mechanism affected by compound A to halt GFP expression in\nyour canine cells?\nTRANSCRIPTION\nb) What process is affected by compound B? Why would this prevent secretion of GFP?\nMessage doesn't leave nucleus. Since translation occurs in the cytoplasm, GFP is never translated.\nc) What process is affected by compound C?\nTranslation never initiates.\nd) Give an example of what might be a target for compound D.\nIt affects initiation into the secretion pathway. Example: affects SRP or docking protein.\ne) What effect does compound E have on cells?\nIt prevents the transport vesicles from budding off the ER."

To express GOSH in\namphibian cells, you have to clone it into an amphibian expression plasmid (pEA) with an\namphibian promoter. Below is the map of pEA.\na) Since pEA does not contain NotI and SalI sites, you decide to PCR-amplify GOSH with\nprimers that will replace the SalI and NotI sites with BamHI and XhoI sites.

The transformed\nfrogs show abnormal eye-tongue coordination. You call this phenotype Helpless.

You measure the number of cells in a tissue culture plate over time.\n° Because you know that Cyclin D is highly upregulated in breast cancer patients, you\nwonder what will happen if you add low levels of Cyclin D inhibitors to the growth\nmedium.

Our immune systems have likewise evolved ways to counteract these\nmethods of evasion.\na) What type(s) of cells of the immune system recognize virally infected cells?\nKILLER T cells!...\notherwise known as Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)\nb) How do these cells do so? Explain briefly.\nThe Killer T cell receptors (TCRs) bind specifically to viral protein epitopes presented on MHC class I\nmolecules. The killer specific T cell upon recognition of this epitope/MHC I complex, secretes perforin\nwhich perforates or makes a hole in the infected cell, killing it.\nc) Besides viruses \"hiding-out\" from most of the immune system within cells, how might viruses further\nprohibit the previously mentioned immune cells from identifying them in host cells? **Hint, our immune\nsystem has retaliated to this evasion technique with special immune cells called natural killer cells (NK cells\nfor short).

Briefly explain how it works.\nAnswer obtained from WWW. The interferon + response: -blocks translation, -endonucleases, degrade\nRNA or can lead to apoptosis or death of the cell before the virus has a chance to replicate. Can render\nadjacent cells resistant to infection.\n\"Interferons are protein components of animal cells which are synthesized and excreted under a\nvariety of stimuli and make other cells of the same species incapable of replicating virus\".\nDeSomer and Cocito 1968\nMIT Biology Department\n7.012: Introductory Biology - Fall 200\nInstructors: Professor Eric Lander, Professor Robert A.

During your tenure in the mouse facilities you notice a colony of mice\nthat is highly susceptible to bacterial infections. In order to figure out why, you first\ntake a blood sample and look at the levels of serum proteins. You are shocked to find\nthat these mice lack antibodies in their serum! You are now aware of why they are so\nsusceptible to infection.\na) What cell type do you suspect is affected by this mutation? Plasma cells.\nWith what little spare time you have from your lab duties and school work, you decide to\ntry to figure out why there are no antibodies circulating in these mice. You find that the\nmutation that leads to the disease is within the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.\nSequencing the locus reveals that the mutation is a deletion of the C-terminal\ntransmembrane domain of the heavy chain. You're not an immunologist and frankly you\nwere kind of surprised to learn that the antibody heavy chain has a transmembrane\ndomain, afterall you always have been taught simply that antibodies are secreted.\nHowever, based on your knowledge of cell signaling that you learned in 7.012, you begin to\nthink of the antibody as a receptor and thus can make sense of why it has a\ntransmembrane domain.\nb) How does the transmembrane domain of the antibody enable the cell to signal from an\n\"antibody receptor\" to the nucleus? (Answer by comparing the alternative possibility in\nwhich the antibody is just secreted.)\n'Antibody receptor' bridges antibody binding to cell stimulatory, mitogenic signaling. If\nantibodies were only secreted there wuld be no way for a cell to 'know' that the antibody\n(Ab) recognized and bound Antigen (Ag) and signal this information directly.\nc) Why might this signalling be important for antibody selection prior to secretion from\nthe cell?\nMembrane bound antibodies that bind antigen very well could stimulate their cells to\ngrow/expand (clonally expand -with of course further stimulation of a helper T cell).\nAntibodies expressed on cells that don't bind antigen well would lack mitogenic signals.\nd) Now hypothesize why these mutant mice lack antibodies in their circulation?\nWithout being able to receive positive mitogenic signals, these cells do not get the signal\nto clonally expand, and thus differientate into plasma cells which secrete antibodies.\n\nQuestion 3\nNote that the 2nd bacterial infection in the figure above would have had to be an infection with\nexactly the same kind of bacterium as the first infection. For instance, a Bordatella pertussis\n(whooping cough) infection followed by a second Bordatella infection at a later time point. A\nBordetella infection followed by a different bacterial infection, for instance, Bacillus anthracis\n(anthrax) would show a different graph.\nThe diagram above depicts a typical antibody response to a primary and secondary\nbacterial infection in wildtype mice.

Indeed, after putting the mice on the candy diet you find that their\nantibody response has changed! It now looks like this...\nYou postulate that the candy must contain some kind of chemical or agent that is causing this\nphenomenon. What specific cell does this hypothetical chemical most likely target? Be very\nspecific and explain your reasoning.\nMemory B cells. Memory B cells are responsible for secondary immune responses. Having a population of\ncells already present that are specific for a particular antigen leads to a rapid and strong response because\nhigher affinity Abs already exist.\nSerum antibodies to bacterial\nwall components\n1st Bacterial Infection\n2nd Bacterial Infection\nmore rapid response\nthan after 1st infection\ngreater response than primary response\n1st Bacterial Infection\n2nd Bacterial Infection\nSerum antibodies to bacterial\nwall components\nsame delay in antibody response\nas in 1st infection\nno increase in magnitude of response\ntime\ntime\nPrimary\nresponse\n\nQuestion 4\nYou are isolating new viruses, one of which you set aside to study further. You measure\nthe amounts of each nucleotide in this virus and determine the following...\nA=20%, G=30%, T=0%, C=30% and U=20%\na) What does this suggest about this viral genome?\nThat it has a double stranded RNA genome.\nYou find a very interesting virus that can infect E. coli that you name Soxrule\nbacteriophage. You measure the amounts of each nucleotide in the Soxrule viral genome\nand determine the following...\nA=18%, G=32%, T=18%, C=32% and U=0%\nb) What does this suggest about this Soxrule genome?\nThat it has a double stranded DNA genome.\nc) After infecting E. coli with the Soxrule virus, you don't see any lysis until after many\nrounds of cell division. What is going on and why is it advantageous for the virus?\nThe virus is undergoing lysogeny, remaining dormant until a later time. After the cell\ndivides, each time now as a lysogen, when the virus becomes lytic there will be many more\nviral particles emerging as there will be many more infected cells. For instance, the\nbacteriophage can choose lysogeny in a cell as long as there are nutrients available but it\nmay choose later to lyse the cells when the environment becomes less nourishing and thus\njump ship and be released into the surroundings looking for new host cells.\nYou perform the following experiment:\n1) Dilute a culture of E. coli strain A into four test tubes.\n2) Dilute a culture of E. coli strain B into four test tubes.\n3) Infect all eight test tubes having the two different bacterial strains with the Soxrule\nbacteriophage and incubate them for several generation times.\n4) Wash the cells in each tube to remove unattached bacteriophage particles.\n5) Purify the chromosomal DNA from the cells in each tube and cut with Cla I restriction\nenzyme.

Although the virus goes into a very specific site, this site\nis either located differently between the two E. coli strains, or more likely, one of the E.\ncoli strains has either lost (Strain B) or acquired (Strain A) a new Cla I site. This is\nreflected by the viral genome showing up in two different sized Cla I fragments.\nTube\nTube\nTube\nTube\nTube\nTube\nTube\nTube\n\nQuestion 5\nYou work in a lab that studies cancer. Your lab receives a package from a hospital\ncontaining a letter that says they sent...\n- breast tissue (from a patient with breast cancer)\n- bladder tissue with a known p21RAS mutation (from a patient with bladder cancer)\n- eye tissue (from a patient with retinoblastoma)\nUnfortunately the labels fell off the tubes, and you take on the task of determining\nwhich sample is which.\nIn order to distinguish between the tissues, you name them 1, 2, and 3, and you perform\nthe following experiments:\n° Transfect a wild-type copy of the Rb gene into each tissue type and wild-type tissue as\na control. You measure the number of cells in a tissue culture plate over time.\n° Because you know that Cyclin D is highly upregulated in breast cancer patients, you\nwonder what will happen if you add low levels of Cyclin D inhibitors to the growth\nmedium. When you perform the experiment, you find that wild type tissue and tissues\n2 and 3 do not grow with Cyclin D inhibitors. The results are as follows.\nUntreated\nTreated\n\ntime\ntime\nuntransfected\ntransfected\ntime\nTissues 1 & 2\nTissue 3\ntime\n# of cells\nCancer\nTissue\ntypes\nTissues 1,2, & 3\n# of cells\n# of cells\nWT tissue\nTissues 2 & 3\nTissue 1\n\n° You know that the Ras protein activates a kinase called Raf. To see if any of the tissues\nare affected, you add low levels of an inhibitor of Raf to the medium. You find that\nwild type tissue does not grow at all with this addition. You measure the number of\ncells in a cell culture plate over time.\na) Based on the results above you can conclude that...\nTissue 1 is ___breast tumor__ Tissue 2 is__ bladder tumor___ Tissue 3 is ___retinoblastoma__\nb) Fill in the blanks.\nIn a cell, one functional copy of the rb gene is sufficient to prevent tumor formation.\ni) The rb gene is therefore referred to as Tumor suppressor gene.\nii) A different gene involved in tumor formation is the ras gene. What kind of gene is\nthe ras gene in terms of cancer biology? Proto oncogene\n\niii) Upon binding to cyclins, ___________CDKs________ change their conformations\nto become active allowing cell cycle progression.\nc) Biologically, how does your answer in b i) differ from your answer b ii)?\nA proto-oncogene can become an oncogene with a single mutation resulting in a gene product that is\nsufficient to cause tumor formation. A tumor suppressor gene must have 2 inactivating mutations-one in\neach copy in the cell to lead to tumor formation.\nFor instance, retinoblastoma, cancer of the retina, is caused initially by a single retinoblast cell acquiring 2\ndistinct mutations, one in each retinoblastoma gene, inactivating each copy.\nOther cancers can be caused by only a mutation in one copy of a gene resulting in an oncogene.\nUntreated\ntime\n# of cells\n# of cells\nTissue 2\nTissues 1 & 3\nTreated\ntime"

The most\npromising therapy has involved incorporating the disease X gene into an adenovirus. Because\nadenovirus is a double-stranded DNA virus that targets lung epithelial cells, it can be used to\ndeliver the disease X gene to the lung cells of the affected individual.\ni) The adenovirus used in these studies is able to produce gp19, a protein that inhibits the\ndisplay of MHC I molecules on the surface of cells. Why is this a desirable property of the\nvirus used to deliver the disease X gene?\nii) Using the plasmids and restriction enzymes provided, design a procedure to create a,\ndouble-stranded DNA to incorporate into the adenovirus particle. The final product should\nbe linear, contain the majority of the virus genome and have the disease X gene under\ncontrol of the E1 promoter (PE1). NheI and SpeI create the same sticky ends.

Consider each mutation independently.\ni) Arg is mutated to a Lys, resulting in a G protein that still binds GDP.\nii) Asp is mutated to a Tyr, resulting in a G protein that cannot bind GDP.\n\nSpring 2004 Final Exam Practice\nQuestion 6\nThe bos/seven receptor is required for differentiation of a particular cell, called R7. It is a\nreceptor tyrosine kinase with the structure below. As a monomer, the protein is inactive.\nBinding of ligand causes the receptor to dimerize, causing phosphorylation of the intracellular\ndomain, activating the protein. During processing of the protein, the extracellular domain is\ncleaved and a disulfide bridge forms between two cysteines, tethering the ligand-binding\ndomain to the rest of the protein.\n-S-S-\nligand-binding\ndomain\nintracellular\nextracellular\nmembrane\n-S-S-\n-S-S-\nligand\nACTIVE\nINACTIVE\nP\nP\na)\ni) How would receptor activity be affected by changing one of the two cysteines shown\nabove to an alanine?

Include the domains of this protein that are required\nfor targeting to and insertion in the plasma membrane. Also label the intracellular and\nextracellular domains.\n\nN\nC\ne) Activation of the above receptor causes Ras to exchange GDP for GTP, thereby activating it.\nThis activated Ras can activate a signal transduction cascade, which ultimately results in the\n\nSpring 2004 Final Exam Practice\ntranscription of genes required for R7 differentiation. In different cells in the same animal, Ras\ncan be activated by an activated growth factor receptor. This leads to transcription of genes\nrequired for cell division.\ni) How is it possible for the activation of Ras to lead to transcription of different sets of\ngenes?\nii) Given that these cells exist in the same animal, name one component in the pathway that\ncould be mutated to give each of the following results (consider each situation\nindependently). Describe how the mutant component differs from the wild-type\ncomponent, and whether it is a loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutation.\n-\nYou never see differentiation of R7 cells.\n-\nYou see uncontrolled cell proliferation.\nQuestion 7\nYou are studying a common genetic condition. The mutant allele differs from the wild-type\nallele by a single base-pair (bp) substitution. This substitution eliminates a NheI restriction site\nthat is present in the wild-type allele. (The mutant allele is not cut by NheI.)

Using PCR techniques, you amplify a\n1000 bp portion of their DNA that includes the site affected by the mutation. You digest the\nPCR products with NheI and analyze the resulting DNA fragments on a gel:\na) Based on these data, is this gene located on an autosome or the X-chromosome? Briefly justify\nyour reasoning.\nb) Based on these data, is the mutant phenotype dominant or recessive to wild-type and why?\nc) If individuals 3 and 4 have a daughter, what is the probability that she will be affected?\nJustify your reasoning.\nYou sequence the region around the NheI site in the wild-type PCR product. You then\nsequence the corresponding region in the mutant PCR product and discover that not only did\nthe mutation eliminate the NheI site in the mutant allele but it has created a new PvuII\nrestriction site. The recognition sites for the two enzymes are indicated below.\nNheI cuts at:\n5' GCTAGC 3'\nPvuII cuts at: 5' CAGCTG 3'\n3' CGATCG 5'\n3' GTCGAC 5'\nA portion of one strand of the wild-type DNA sequence is shown below:\n5'....GCTAGCTG...3'\nd) What is the sequence of this same region in the mutant allele?\nIndicate the 5' and the 3' ends of the DNA sequence.\n1000 bp\n600 bp\n400 bp\nIndividual:\nNheI\nNheI\nNheI\nNheI\n\nSpring 2004 Final Exam Practice\ne) Individuals 1 and 2 have another child, 9, who is affected by the genetic condition.\nYou PCR amplify the 1000 bp region affected by the mutation from individuals 1, 2, and 9,\ndigest the PCR products with NheI or PvuII, and analyze the restriction fragments on a gel:\nNheI PvuII\nIndividual:\nNheI PvuII\nNheI PvuII\n1000 bp\n600 bp\n400 bp\nWhat event occurred and how does this explain the data shown above?\n\nSpring 2004 Final Exam Practice\nQuestion 8\nWhile walking through the sub-basement of the Infinite Corridor late one night you come\nupon an enclave of gnomes. You are struck by the color of their beards, which are all blue.\n(Gnomes are diploid organisms, both male and female gnomes have beards, and you can\nassume that the gnomes are true-breeding for this trait.) The following week you are busy\npulling a hack at Harvard when you spy another enclave of gnomes. All of these gnomes\nhave yellow beards. (Again assume that the gnomes are true-breeding for this trait.) Curious,\nyou collect a few yellow-bearded gnomes from Harvard and bring them back to MIT. Later\nyou discover that several of the yellow-bearded gnomes and blue-bearded gnomes have\nmated. The offspring of these matings are all green-bearded.

The protein would be shorter by two amino\nacids.\niii) This frameshift mutation will result in the protein being terminated prematurely because a\nnew stop codon was created. As a result of this deletion, the new sequence of the peptide would\nbe : H3N+-methionine-alanine-COO-\nd) Puromycin functions by entering the A site of the ribosome. Here, because puromycin is\nstructurally similar to the aminoacyl-tRNA, it can participate in formation of a peptide bond with the\nnascent polypeptide chain. Puromycin causes peptide release from the ribosome because there is no t-\nRNA anticodon to link the mRNA to the peptide chain.\nQuestion 3\ni) What are the two advantages of using a live-attenuated vaccine vs. a heat killed vaccine in this case?\nIt'll mimic the disease by invading cells, thus it will illicit both a humoral and cellular response.\nSurface proteins will not be denatured by heat.\nii) What is a disadvantage of using a live-attenuated vaccine?\nCould acquire virulence factors, Need a \"cold chain\" (expensive refrigeration), it may make people sick.\nb) The rabbit protein is recognized as foreign (non-self) by the guinea pig.\nc) B cells, by gene rearrangement of Ab genes (VDJ rearrangement).

These site are not present on the exterior of the substrate when the\nsubstrate is properly folded. When the disulfide bonds within the substrate protein are disrupted, the 3\ndimensional shape is altered, and the protein unfolds. This allows enzyme X access to sites that were\npreviously protected within the substrate protein.\nc) You conduct mutational studies of enzyme E. You examine the kinetics of the various mutants as compared to the normal enzyme.

You have just joined a lab that\nrecently published a paper in Galactic Scientific reporting a new microorganism named\nMetachlorianus forcus, called metachlorians. These microorganisms colonize the brains of most\nhumanoids. However, in those who are part of the religious sect known as the Jedi, they are found\nin very high concentrations. In Jedi, these microorganisms secrete a protein known as Saberin.\nSaberin is encoded by the gene saberin. Saberin, when released in the brain, makes the Jedi\nemanate a sword known to many as a light saber. Blue is the most common light saber color amongst\nthe Jedi.\nYou would like to understand this phenomenon. First, you study the metachlorians. Like present day\nyeast cells, the metachlorians can live in both a diploid and haploid state. Knowing this, you can\nnow study the genetics of the light saber phenomenon.\nThe assay:\nYou mutagenize haploid metachlorians and isolate mutants altered in the light saber phenomenon.\nThe way you are going to look for mutants is by injecting mutagenized strains into the brain of a\nwilling Jedi, Jacensolo, who has been depleted of his own metachlorians. Because the strains you\nwill inject are growth impaired, they stay around only long enough for Jacensolo to make one light\nsaber. This allows you to follow the protocol shown:\n-\nInject mutant strain of metachlorians into the brain of Jacensolo\n-\nAllow Jacensolo to make a light saber\n-\nCheck light saber color for non-blue colors\n-\nLet the injected metachlorians die off\n-\nInject a new mutant strain\nIn this procedure, you isolate 10 mutants: m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, m8, m9 and m10. All of these\nmutants cause Jacensolo to create light sabers that are not blue.\nThe first thing you do is to find out how many complementation groups exist. So, you make diploid\ncombinations between each of the mutants. You then inject these diploids into Jacensolo and see if he\nproduces a blue (WT) light saber. The results are shown below:\n(+) = Blue light saber (-) = non-blue light saber\nm1\nm2\nm3\nm4\nm5\nm6\nm7\nm8\nm9\nm10\nwt\nm1\n---\n---\n+++\n+++\n+++\n+++\n---\n+++\n+++\n---\n+++\nm2\n---\n+++\n+++\n+++\n+++\n---\n+++\n+++\n---\n+++\nm3\n---\n+++\n+++\n---\n+++\n---\n+++\n---\n+++\nm4\n---\n---\n+++\n+++\n+++\n---\n---\n+++\nm5\n---\n+++\n+++\n+++\n---\n---\n+++\nm6\n---\n+++\n---\n+++\n---\n+++\nm7\n---\n+++\n+++\n---\n+++\nm8\n---\n+++\n---\n+++\nm9\n---\n---\n+++\nm10\n---\n---\n\na) How many complementation groups exist in your collection of mutants? ___________\nb) How many genes have you found involved with this phenomenon? ______________\nc) Designate your complementation groups A, B, C, D, E, F,... and so on.\n(Put m1 into Group A). Which mutants are in each of your complementation groups?\nNow you want to find out the order in which these genes' products are acting. You do this\nby constructing haploid metachlorians with 2 mutations. The results of this analysis are\nshown.\nDouble\nmutant\nSword\ncolor\nDouble\nmutant\nSword\ncolor\nDouble\nmutant\nSword\ncolor\nDouble\nmutant\nSword\ncolor\nDouble\nmutant\nSword\ncolor\nDouble\nmutant\nSword\ncolor\nDouble\nmutant\nSword\ncolor\nDouble\nmutant\nSword\ncolor\nm1 m2\nRed\nm2 m3\nYellow\nm3 m4\nYellow\nm4 m5\nGreen\nm5 m6\nYellow\nm6 m7\nYellow\nm7 m8\nYellow\nm8 m9\nYellow\nm1 m3 Yellow\nm2 m4\nRed\nm3 m5\nYellow\nm4 m6\nYellow\nm5 m7\nRed\nm6 m8\nYellow\nm7 m9\nRed\nm1 m4\nRed\nm2 m5\nRed\nm3 m6\nYellow\nm4 m7\nRed\nm5 m8\nYellow\nm6 m9\nYellow\nm1 m5\nRed\nm2 m6\nYellow\nm3 m7\nYellow\nm4 m8\nYellow\nm5 m9\nGreen\nm1 m6 Yellow\nm2 m7\nRed\nm3 m8\nYellow\nm4 m9\nGreen\nm1 m7\nRed\nm2 m8\nYellow\nm3 m9\nYellow\nm1 m8 Yellow\nm2 m9\nRed\nm1 m9\nRed\nd) What do you call this kind of analysis? _________________________\ne) Draw the light saber color pathway below:\nExample:\nenzX enzY\nOrange purple black\nh) Luke Skywalker made a green light saber.

If it does, is that interaction now stronger or\nweaker? For example, if Ser 161 was changed to Ala, the ability to form a hydrogen bond\nwould be lost. Therefore the interaction is weaker, and you may predict that the\nsubstrate no longer binds.\n3)\nDominant: Phenotype 1 is dominant over phenotype 2 if the F1 heterozygote of the two\nalleles shows phenotype 1.\nRecessive: Phenotype 2 in the above example above is recessive. In other words, a\nrecessive phenotype is only visible when the recessive alleles are homozygous.\nPhenotype: An observed characteristic of an individual that develops under the influence\nof one or more genes and the environment. Any trait that can be measured is a phenotype.\nGenotype: The description of a genetic makeup of an individual, in terms of what alleles it\nhas for one or more genes.\nAlleles: Alternative forms of a gene.\n\nHomozygous: In a diploid organism, homozygous implies that the same allele of a given gene\nis carried by each of the homologous chromosomes.\nHeterozygous: Different alleles of the same gene are carried by the pair of homologous\nchromosomes. Homozygosity and heterozygosity refers to the genotype of a given gene.\nAn organism may be homozygous for one gene, and heterozygous for another.\nMendel's First Law: There are discreet units of inheritance that are separable in the\ngametes. This is also called the law of segregation.\nMendel's Second Law: The law of independent assortment says that unlinked genes will\nsegregate independently of one another.\nSex linked means that the gene is located on the X or Y chromosome.

Would it be\nfunctional?\nii) Where would this receptor protein be localized if its signaling domain were deleted? Would it be\nfunctional?\niii) What common characteristic do the side chains of the amino acids found in a transmembrane\ndomain share, and why?\niv) Which domain (ligand binding, transmembrane, or signaling) of the wild-type receptor protein is\ninserted into the ER lumen during translation? Why must the receptor protein be inserted in this\nfashion to become functional?\nb) The mature mRNA encoding a protein destined for secretion specifies a polypeptide chain of 497\namino acids; yet the protein that is actually secreted by the cell is 475 amino acids long.\ni) How can you account for this size difference?\nii) Would a transmembrane protein also show this disparity? Briefly explain your answer.\n\nANSWERS\nQuestion 1\na)\ni) FALSE. DNA replication is initiated at the origin of replication. RNA polymerases bind to\npromoter sequences to initiate transcription.\nii) FALSE. RNA polymerase does not require primers to initiate RNA synthesis. DNA\npolymerase requires primers to initiate DNA replication.\niii) FALSE. Okazaki fragments are made on the lagging strand at the replication fork.\niv) FALSE. DNA synthesis occurs by addition of dNTPs to the 3' OH group of the nucleotide\nat the end of the growing strand.\nv) FALSE. Transcription terminates at the transcription termination sites in the DNA.\nTranslation terminates at stop codons in the mRNA.\nb) genomic DNA sequence:\n5'-AGCTCATGTGCGAGTCCTGACGCTGACTAGG-3'\n3'-TCGAGTACACGCTCAGGACTGCGACTGATCC-5'\nmature mRNA sequence (G* = G cap):\n\n5'-G*UCAUGUGCGAACGCUGACUAGGAAAAAAAA....3'\nstart codon\nstop codon\nmet cys glu arg\ni) see DNA sequence above\nii)\n1) 5' capping 2) 3' polyadenylation\niii) There are four amino acids in this viral peptide: NH3+-met-cys-glu-arg-COO-\niv) In eukaryotic cells because the RNA processing and splicing machinery is only present in\neukaryotes.\nQuestion 2\nThe term \"central dogma\" refers to the flow of biological information from DNA to RNA to protein.\nDNA\nRNA\nProtein\na)\ni) In the spaces below, indicate the process that corresponds to each arrow.\n1. replication 2. transcription,\n3. translation\n\nii) Name the initiation site for each processes, and on which molecule this site exists.\n1.

RNA polymerase\n3. ribosome\nb) What is a gene? Please answer in one sentence. The first sentence written will be considered as your answer.\nA gene is a segment of DNA containing information for directing the synthesis of a protein (or RNA).\nc)\nWhat two specific effects will streptomycin have on protein synthesis in prokaryotes?\nStreptomycin will prevent the correct initiation of protein synthesis since it prevents association of\nthe met-tRNA with the ribosome. Streptomycin will also lead to inaccurate translation (insertion of\nincorrect amino acids) in those proteins that were in the process of being translated.\nQuestion 3\nA.\nprimer:\ntemplate DNA:\n5'-ACTGAC-3'\n5'-ACCACTAACGTCAGT-3'\nG A T C\n+\nDNA length\n(nts)\n15-\n14-\n13-\n12-\n11-\n10-\n9-\n8-\n7-\n6-\n5-\n4-\n3-\n2-\n1-\na) An end generated by digestion with BamHI can be ligated to an end generated by digestion with BglII. Why is this possible?\nDigestion with BglII or BamHI produce the same overhangs, or sticky ends. Thus the ends\nproduced by cutting with BglII are complementary to the ends produced with BamHI, base\npairing and ligation can occur.\nb) You want to insert the gene encoding the polio antigen into pBAN. Devise a strategy to accomplish this. Identify the\nenzyme(s) you would use to cut pBAN, the enzyme(s) you would use to cut pKR-polio, and the steps necessary to generate the\nintact plasmid.\nCut pBAN with BamHI to linearize.\nCut pKR-polio with BglII, this gives a 1400 bp fragment containing the gene for the polio antigen and\na 3100 bp fragment.\nSize select the DNA from the pKR-polio plasmid to obtain the 1400 bp fragment.\nLigate the 1400 bp fragment together with the cut pBAN plasmid.\nc) You next transform E. coli with the plasmids you have made. You grow the transformed cells on media containing (circle one):\nampicillin\nkanamycin\nboth ampicillin and kanamycin\nneither ampicillin nor kanamycin\n\nWhy?\nThe media should contain ampicillin only, because the plasmid with the promoter and banana\ninsertion sequences has a gene for ampicillin resistance.\nd) i) Draw plasmids 1, 2, and 3, indicating all relevant features such as the promoter, the origin of replication,\nthe genes for ampicillin resistance and the polio antigen, restriction sites and distances (in base pairs) between\nthe sites.\nB.\nBanana specific\npromoter\nBamHI/BglII\nEcoRI\nBamHI/BglII\nEcoRI\nBamHI\nstart codon\nstop codon\namp gene\nR\nori\npolio antigen gene\nplasmid 1\nBanana specific\npromoter\nBamHI/BglII\nEcoRI\nBamHI/BglII\nEcoRI\nBamHI\nstart codon\nstop codon\namp gene\nR\nori\npolio antigen gene\nplasmid 2\npBAN\nplasmid 3\nori\nBanana specific\npromoter\nBamHI\nEcoRI\namp gene\nR\nii) Which of the three plasmids would allow synthesis of the protein in a banana?

It would be non-functional.\nii) Where would this receptor protein be localized if its signaling domain were deleted?\nIt would be inserted into the plasma membrane, but would not be functional without a signaling\ndomain.\niii) What common characteristic do the side chains of the amino acids found in a transmembrane\ndomain share, and why?\nThe transmembrane domain, is composed of amino acids with hydrophobic side chains because\nthe interior of the lipid bilayer is hydrophobic.\niv) Which domain (ligand-binding, transmembrane, or signaling) of the wild-type receptor protein is\ninserted into the ER lumen during translation? Why must the receptor protein be inserted in this\nfashion to become functional?\nThe ligand-binding domain is inserted into the ER lumen. Upon secretory vesicle fusion with\nthe plasma membrane, the interior of the ER becomes the outside of the cell where the ligand-\nbinding domain must be in order to bind ligand.\nb) i) How can you account for this size difference?\nA signal sequence of 22 amino acids is cleaved during translation into the ER.\nii) Would a transmembrane protein also show this disparity? Briefly explain.\nYes. A transmembrane protein also has a signal sequence, which is also cleaved during\ntranslation into the ER."

Weinberg, Dr. Claudette Gardel\n\nQuestion 1\nA) You infected mice with mouse mammary tumor virus (a retrovirus). After a period\nof time, most infected mice had developed breast tumors, whereas uninfected mice did\nnot. You isolated cell lines from over 50 independent tumors. You demonstrated that\nall of these lines had virus integrations in the same chromosomal location. Can one\nconclude that the virus integrates into cellular DNA at only one site? Explain.\nB) The ras oncogene is involved in a variety of human and animal cancers. DNA was\nisolated from a number of normal and cancerous tissues.\n-Cellular DNA was digested with EcoRI.\n-Digested DNA was separated by gel electrophoresis and transfered to a\nnitrocellulose membrane.\n-The membrane was probed with the radioactive labelled cloned ras DNA and then\nthe membrane was exposed to x-ray film.\n-The resulting autoradiograph is shown below.\n1) white blood cells from a healthy human\n2) human lymphoma cells (cancerous)\n3) human bladder carcinoma cells (cancerous)\n4) human sarcoma cells (cancerous)\n5) blood from a healthy mouse\n6) mouse myeloma cells (cancerous)\n10 kb\n5 kb\n1 kb\nmore than 2 copies/genome\n2 copies/genome\n1 copies/genome\n\nQuestion 1 continued\na) How do you explain the presence of sequences complementary to the oncogene in the\nDNA from healthy human and mouse samples? Why don't they have cancer?\nb) Why is the hybridizing band from sample 1 a different size than that from sample 5?\nc) For each cancer examined above, based on the autoradiogram, choose the most likely\nmechanism of transformation and explain your choice:\n1) point mutation within the gene\n2) chromosomal rearrangement involving the gene\n3) gene amplification\n4) oncogenic retroviral insertion.\nQuestion 2\nYou are studying the cell cycle in haploid yeast cells. You isolate a cell that is a\ntemperature-sensitive cell division cycle (cdc) mutant, cdcX-. cdcX- grows normally at\n25 °C, but arrests at 36 °C at the point in the cell cycle where the expression of the\nnormal cdcX gene is required.\nTo determine where in the cell cycle expression of cdkX is required, you design\nexperiments based on the following facts:\n1) The drug nocodazole arrests, but does not kill yeast in mitosis (M phase).\n2) Cell density can be measured to determine if the yeast cells have completed a\ncell division.\nFor your experiments:\n- You incubate cdkX- cells at 25 °C with nocodazole until all the cells are\nsynchronized. You then shift the cells to 36 °C and remove the nocodazole.\nThe cells divide once and then arrest.\n- You incubate cdkX- cells at 36 °C until all arrest. You then add nocodazole\nand shift the cells to 25 °.\nThe cells arrest without dividing.\na) Given these experiments you can assume that the protein encoded by the cdkX gene\nis not required at what phase(s) of the cell?\n\nAnother mutant cdkY- is a cold-sensitive mutant that arrests at 18 °C, but grows\nnormally at 25 °C. cdkY- cells arrest between the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. You\nmake cdkX- cdkY- double mutants and perform the following experiments.\n- You incubate cdkX- cdkY- double mutants at 36 °C until all the cells are\nsynchronized and then shift the cells to 18 °.\n-\nThe cells arrest without dividing.\n- You incubate cdkX- cdkY- double mutants at 18 °C until all until all the cells\nare synchronized and then shift the cells to 36 °C.\n-\nThe cells divide once and then arrest.\nb) Given these experiments you can assume that the protein encoded by the cdkX gene\nis not required at what phase(s) of the cell?\nc) In what stage(s) of the cell cycle do you expect the protein encoded by the cdkX gene\nto act?\nd) A cell in the process of DNA replication (cell A) is fused with a cell in early G1 (cell\nB). How does the timing of the cell cycle for the cell B nucleus in the fused cell compare\nto that expected for the cell B nucleus if the cells remained independent?\ne) What soluble factor(s) are found in cell A but not in cell B (check all that apply)?\n___\npRB protein\n___\na cAMP dependent kinase\n___\nTGFβ\n___\na G2 cyclin\n___\nHuman papilloma virus\n___\nan S-phase cyclin\n___\na cyclin dependent kinase\n___\nan oncogene\n____ a G1 cyclin\n\nQuestion 3\nPart I\nAs a premier cancer biologist, you often plate cells in dishes, feeding them serum with\ngrowth factors and allowing them to grow for 2 weeks. Sometimes after incubation of\nstrains you observe the following when looking at the side of a culture dish.\nStrain A\nStrain B\na) Which plate shows abnormal cells? Explain.\nb) Predict the behavior of these cell lines if grown without added growth factors by\ndrawing what the plates will look like after incubation without growth factors. Simply\nmodify the existing figure below for your answer. (Note: one cell from each strain is\ninitially deposited in each dish.)\nStrain A\nStrain B\nPart II\nA fellow researcher gives you two cancerous cell lines to examine and determine\npossible mutations. The results are shown below.\nCell Line\nMutation\nWT\nnone (wild type DNA)\na deletion at the same region on both copies of chromosome 4\na point mutation in a gene on only one copy of chromosome 7\nc) Based on this data above, identify the type of cancer gene that is mutated in each of\nthe cell lines.\nCell Line\nCancer Gene\n(oncogene or tumor suppressor gene)\nWT\nnone\n\nQuestion 3 continued\nYou learn that cell line 1 is a skin cancer cell line. The region you identified as deleted\non chromosome 4 in these cells normally contains a gene called p16.\nd) What is the role of the p16 gene product in the normal cell based on the information\nabove?\nYou obtain another cell line (cell line 3) that has one wild-type copy of chromosome 4\nand one mutant copy of chromosome 4 (as described above in cell line 1).\ne) Will cell line 3 display a cancerous phenotype when grown in the presence of growth\nfactors? Yes/No (Circle one.)\nExplain briefly.\nf) Will cell line 3 display a cancerous phenotype when grown in the absence of growth\nfactors? Yes/No (Circle one.)\nExplain briefly.\nPart III\ng) Cell line 2 is a breast cancer cell line that expresses a mutant version of a receptor\nprotein called KIT. Choose from the following options to explain the role of KIT in\nnormal cells.\nCircle one.\nActivation of KIT causes cells to die\nActivation of KIT promotes progression through the cell cycle.\nActivation of KIT has no effect on the cell cycle.\nActivation of KIT causes cells to enter G0.\nh) Specifically how could a point mutation in the gene encoding the KIT receptor cause\nthe abnormal behavior depicted in Part I.\n\nQuestion 4\nYou know in yeast that mitosis takes one hour. You decide to further study the cell\ncycle in yeast cells using radioactive dTTP. Cells grown in radioactive dTTP\nincorporate this radioactive nucleotide into their DNA.\nYou label a population of asynchronously growing yeast cells by adding radioactive dTTP to the\nmedium for one minute. You then replace this medium with medium containing unlabelled dTTP and\ncontinue growing the cells. At one hour time points following the replacement you count the number\nof radioactively labeled cells in mitosis. Your data is shown below.\n12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nTime (in hours) after addition of unlabelled medium\nNumber of labelled cells in mitosis\na) Cells are in which phase of the cell cycle when incorporating radioactive dTTP\ninto their DNA?

You decide to leave the\nworld of science and get a job as a script-consultant on a new medical drama (ER-like)\nshow. You test the writers with a few questions to see just how much they know.\na) Compare how macrophages and B cells recognize antigen.\nb) Compare how macrophages and B cells present antigenic peptides (epitopes).\nThey present epitopes exactly the same way on their MHC II molecules on the surface.\nc) Macrophages and B cells present antigens to ________ _____-cells. (Fill in blanks.)\nd) Name 2 components of the innate or nonspecific immune system.\n_______________________\n_________________________\nBelow are short descriptions given to you by the writers of scenarios in the early\nepisodes.\nScenario #1\nOne of the characters on the show is diagnosed with leukemia, a cancer of the blood\nsystem. She is very sick until her boyfriend bravely agrees to donate his bone marrow.\nThe bone marrow transplant is successful and our character lives!\ne) You tell the writers that the bone marrow transplant from the boyfriend is unlikely\nto be successful. Give the reason and the molecular basis for why.\nBecause of the different major histocompatability molecules the marrow will be\nrejected.\nScenario #2\nThe leading doctor gives birth to a baby boy. After some time, the child shows no\nacquired or specific immune response and is diagnosed with a rare disorder, Severe\nCombined Immune Deficiency (SCID), and as a result the boy must live in a germ-free\nenvironment. Several causes of SCID have been described and are listed below.\nf) For each cause, indicate which of the following branches of immune system are\naffected. (Cellular =Cell-Mediated)\nCause Cell-Mediated, Humoral or Both\nT cells fail to develop\nDNA recombination deficiency\nAbsence of MHC class I molecules\nLack of MHC class II molecules\n\nScenario #3\nPatients in the hospital are coming down with multiple infections. Lab results show that\nthe sick are infected with a bacterium, S. aureus, that secretes \"Protein A\" which binds\nthe constant region of antibodies.\ng) What cell recognizes the constant region of secreted antibodies? ____________\nh) Why might the effect of Protein A allow multiple (non S. aureus) infections?\ni) What branch of the immune system does S. aureus evade using Protein A?\nHumoral\nCellular or Cell-Mediated\nBoth\nScenario #4\nMany patients are coming into the emergency room with a disease caused by an\nunknown pathogen! A doctor studies this pathogen in order to create a vaccine against\nit.\nj) He discovers that the infectious agent is an intracellular bacterium and its cell surface\nis coated with human-like proteins. Considering the mechanism of the pathogen, the\ndoctor decides to generate a live-attenuated vaccine instead of a heat-killed vaccine.\ni) What are the two advantages of using a live-attenuated vaccine vs. a heat killed\nvaccine in this case?\nii) What is a disadvantage of using a live-attenuated vaccine?\nQuestion 6\na) Shown below is a schematic of the production of a heavy chain polypeptide for an\nantibody. At the top is the chromosomal arrangement found in an immature B cell, at\nthe bottom is shown the heavy chain polypeptide.\ni) Label the process indicated by each arrow. Choose the one best option for each\nfrom:\nprotein processing\nRNA ligation\ntranscription\nRNA splicing\ntranslation\nDNA rearrangement\ntransduction\nDNA ligation\nii) Indicate on the diagram below where you would expect to find each of the\nfollowing components;\nPromoter\nTranscription terminator\nstart codon\nstop codon\niii) Indicate on the diagram below the variable and the constant region of the heavy\nchain polypeptide.\n\nV segments\nD segments\nJ segments\nconstant segment\n= intron regions\nb) Indicate whether each of the following statements is true or false. If false, correct the\nstatement or provide a brief explanation for why it is false.\ni) Memory cells are the basis for a strong secondary humoral immune response.\nii) T cells produce antibodies that bind antigen.\niii) Macrophages present antigenic peptides on MHC II proteins to B cells.\niv) Clonal expansion means that any B cells present at the time of exposure to an\nantigen will be stimulated to proliferate.\nv) The two antigen binding sites formed by the variable regions in a single antibody\nmolecule bind to two different antigenic determinants.\nc) When a rabbit protein is injected into rabbits, no antibodies against this protein are\ngenerated. If, however, the same rabbit protein is injected into guinea pigs, the guinea\npigs generate antibodies against the rabbit protein. Briefly (in one or two sentences)\nexplain this observation.\n\nd) The genomes contained in almost all of the somatic cells in an adult human are\nidentical. Name one (diploid) cell type that is an exception to this and specify the\nprocess by which the genetic variation occurred.\ne) Will siblings have the exact same antibody repertoire? What about identical twins?\nBriefly explain your reasoning.\nAnswers\nQuestion 1\nA) One cannot conclude that the virus is able to integrate at only one site. However, one might\npropose that the virus can only cause cancer when it integrates into a certain chromosomal\nlocation or next to a specific gene. In fact, viruses can integrate many places throughout the\ngenome. The reason you only observed integration events at one site is because you have\nexamined only those events that cause tumors. Perhaps the integration of the virus next to a\nproto-oncogene can cause it to become oncogenic, possibly by activating expression of the\noncogene in the wrong place or at the wrong time.\nB)\na) The sequences that are complementary to the probe in normal cell DNA correspond to the\ncellular proto-oncogene. The individuals from that the material came don't have cancer because\nthey have not acquired the mutations necessary to turn the proto-oncogene into an oncogene.\nb) Random sequence variation between mouse and human DNA alters the restriction map\naround the gene. The two species diverged from a common ancestor during the process of\nevolution, and DNA sequence variation has been accumulating since. Some of these variations\noccur in restriction enzyme sites.\nc) -lane 2: a chromosomal rearrangement or a point mutation at one of EcoRI restriction sites\nare the most probable mechanisms because one copy of the gene has changed its\nlocation with respect to at least one of the flanking EcoR1 sites.\n-lane 3: a point mutation within the coding sequence of the gene is the probable mechanism of\ntransformation because there is no obvious change in the Southern blot--none of the\nrestriction sites have been altered.\n-lane 4: gene amplification has created many copies of the gene which probably are present in\nseveral tandem arrays in the sarcoma DNA.\n- lane 6: retroviral transduction has brought an extra copy of the oncogene into the cell. Since\nthe smaller fragment is still present in two copies per cell, there has probably not been\nany change in the \"resident\" proto-oncogenes.\nQuestion 2\na) Given these experiments you can assume that the protein encoded by the cdkX gene is not required at what\nphase(s) of the cell?\nM phase\nb) Given these experiments you can assume that the protein encoded by the cdkX gene is not required at what\nphase(s) of the cell?\nG2 phase or M phase\nc) In what stage(s) of the cell cycle do you expect the protein encoded by the cdkX gene to act?\nG1 or S phase\n\nd) How does the timing of the cell cycle for the cell B nucleus in the fusion cell compare to that expected if the cells\nremained independent?\nIn the fusion cell, the DNA of cell B immediately begins replication (S-phase). If cell B had\nremained independent, S-phase would have occurred later.\ne) What soluble factor(s) are found in cell A but not in cell B (check all that apply)?\n___\nRB protein\n___\na cAMP dependent kinase\n___\nTGFβ\n___\na G2 cyclin\n___\nHuman papilloma virus\n_X_\nan S-phase cyclin\n___\na cyclin dependent kinase\n___\nan oncogene\n_X_\na G1 cyclin\nQuestion 3\nPart I\nAs a premier cancer biologist, you often plate cells in dishes, feeding them serum with growth factors and allowing them to grow\nfor 2 weeks. Sometimes after incubation of strains you observe the following when looking at the side of a culture dish.\nStrain A\nStrain B\na) Which plate shows abnormal cells? Explain.\nThe plate on the left. Strain A shows no contact inhibition. Normal cells stop growing when they\ntouch each other. Abnormal cells pile up.\nb) Predict the behavior of these cell lines if grown without added growth factors by drawing what the plates will look like after\nincubation without growth factors. Simply modify the existing figure below for your answer. (Note: one cell from each strain is\ninitially deposited in each dish.)\nStrain A\nStrain B\nPart II\nA fellow researcher gives you two cancerous cell lines to examine and determine possible mutations. The results are shown below.\nCell Line\nMutation\nWT\nnone (wild type DNA)\na deletion at the same region on both copies of chromosome 4\na point mutation in a gene on only one copy of chromosome 7\nc) Based on this data above, identify the type of cancer gene that is mutated in each of the cell lines.\nCell Line\nCancer Gene\n(oncogene or tumor suppressor gene)\nWT\nnone\nTSG\nONCOGENE\nYou learn that cell line 1 is a skin cancer cell line. The region you identified as deleted on chromosome 4\nin these cells normally contains a gene called p16.\n\nd) What is the role of the p16 gene product in the normal cell based on the information\nabove?\nIt is a gatekeeper of the cell cycle (the brake linings) preventing progression through cell\ncycle unless all checks out. It inhibits cell proliferation.\nYou obtain another cell line (cell line 3) that has one wild-type copy of chromosome 4 and one mutant\ncopy of chromosome 4 (as described above in cell line 1).\ne) Will cell line 3 display a cancerous phenotype when grown in the presence of growth\nfactors? Yes/No (Circle one.)\nExplain briefly.\nNo, it the p16 mutation is recessive to wild-type. Basically the mutant chromosome 4\ngives a recessive cancerous phenotype.

Yes/No (Circle one.)\nExplain briefly.\nIt will not grow. THERE ARE NO GROWTH FACTORS. Cell line 3's cancerous\nphenotype is recessive. (Not simply that the cells wouldn't grow because cell line 3\ncontains a WT copy of the p16 gene, and enough p16 protein is present to block\nproceeding through the cell cycle given the absence of growth factors.)\nPart III\ng) Cell line 2 is a breast cancer cell line that expresses a mutant version of a receptor protein\ncalled KIT.

      "content": "AIDS and the Immune System\n\nIn order to understand AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), we need to discuss two\nmajor biological phenomena: the virus that causes AIDS, known as human immunodeficiency\nvirus, HIV, and the cells in the immune system that are by HIV. Only when both are described\ndoes the disease begin to make sense. We begin by extending our earlier description of how the\nimmune system works and then examining the details of the life cycle of .\n\nIn our earlier discussion of immune cells, we listed two major classes of lymphocytes that\ntogether carry out the bulk of the functions needed for effective immunity - the B lymphocytes,\nwhose descendant make antibodies, and the T lymphocytes. The disease of AIDS is ultimately\nabout T lymphocytes, or rather their loss.\n\nThe T lymphocytes (so named because they begin their development and diversification in the\nthymus, the gland near the thyroid gland in the neck) can be further divided into two subclasses:\nthe cytotoxic or killer lymphocytes (TC cells) and the helper T cells (TH cells). The TC cells are\nspecialized to recognizeand kill infected or otherwise defective cells throughout the body. By\nkilling a cell recently infected by a virus, for example, the TC cells can abort the viral infectious\ncycle that may have started inside the cell befor the virus has a chance to multiply significantly.\nThis is a highly effective way by which the immune system prevents the extensive spread of\nviruses throughout the body.\n\nB cell activation\n\nThe other class of T lymphocytes, the TH cells, are the central targets of attack by HIV, the\ncausal agent of AIDS. For that reason, we will now elaborate in more detail TH cell function.\nTH cells are not responsible for directly making antibody (the job of the B cells) or for killing\ninfected or defective cells (the job of the TC cells). Their role is instead largely regulatory: the\nTH cells tell the B cells when they should begin clonal expansion and antibody diversification.\nThus, they control the B cells. Such control is vital to a well-functioning immune system that\nmight otherwise make inadequate or excess antibody in response to antigenic challenge. An\noutline of how this occurs is pictured schematically in part (a) of Fig. 19.18 in Purves.\n\nIn our previous discussion of antibody production, the implication was that foreign protein\nmolecules serve as the antigenic stimulus to provoke B cells. In fact, the provoking antigenic\nstimuli in the immune system are never entire protein molecules, but only fragments thereof.\nThese oligopeptide fragments are generated by and displayed on the surface macrophages and\nthe B cells. The macrophages and the B cells can ingest foreign antigenic proteins and cleave\nthem into small pieces. The resulting protein fragments are positioned on the external surface of\nthe cell where they serve as the immediate antigenic stimuli that cause B cell clonal expansion\nand antibody production. A macrophage cell itself has no immunological specificity. In the case\nof the poliovirus particles discussed in a previous lecture, the macrophage will ingested\npoliovirus, break down the capsid protein molecules into a number of small oligopeptide\nfragments and then export these to its plasma membrane, displaying them on its extracellular\nsurface\n\nAIDS and the Immune System\n\nMIT Biology Department\n7.012: Introductory Biology - Fall 2004\nInstructors: Professor Eric Lander, Professor Robert A. Weinberg, Dr. Claudette Gardel\n\nNow many TH cells come by and look over the oligopeptides that the macrophage is displaying.\nEach of the T helper cells that passes by and examines the macrophage's oligopeptide \"wares\"\n(as would a shopper in a store) has a very narrow, circumscribed interest in only one particular\nantigen. When, by rare coincidence, an antigenic fragment displayed by the macrophage is\nrecognized by the T helper, the TH cell becomes physiologically activated, and begins a program\nof rapid clonal expansion. Of course, in the great majority of cases, encounters between the\nhelper T cell and macrophages will not result in clonal expansion because the TH cell will not\nhappen across the antigenic fragment in which it has a special interest.\n\nOnce the TH cell has undergone physiologic activation and clonal expansion, it will go on to its\nnext phase of life, its next job. It will now seek out B lymphocytes that happen to be interested\nin the very same antigenic fragment. The B cell's \"specialized interest\" in one or another antigen\narises, as described in the immunology lectures, through the unique antibody on the B cell\nsurface. The TH cell, having found a B cell which shares interest in the same oligopeptide\nantigen, will then bind to the B cell and send a signal (via growth factors termed cytokines) to the\nB cell that induces the B cell to become activated and undergo clonal expansion. The B cell will\nthen proliferate in response and produce descendant plasma cells that eventually begin to secrete\nantibody.\n\nIn effect, the helper TH cell is saying to the B cell \"I have recognized an oligopeptide antigen\nfragment displayed by a macrophage. I see that you're interested in the same oligopeptide\nantigen. The fact that we have both encountered this antigen on separate occasions suggests that\nthis is an important antigen against which you must mount a response. For that reason, I am now\nurging you proliferate and make antibody against this antigenic fragment.\"\n\nWithout this command coming from the TH cell, the B cell will not begin its program of clonal\nexpansion and antibody production. Only now do we begin to sense the vital (albeit indirect)\nrole played by the TH cell in antibody production.\n\nAIDS\n\nWe have all read about the discovery of the AIDS virus, both in France and in the United States\nin 1981. In the U.S., a cluster of 5 young, homosexual men were discovered who suffered from\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia infections, a disease that was otherwise only known in severely\nimmuno-suppressed individuals. Soon thereafter, it was realized that their immuno-suppression\nwas more far-reaching, involving mucosal yeast infections, widespread, disseminated\ncytomegalovirus infections, and chronic peri-anal herpes simplex virual infections. In addition\nto these debilitating infections, these individuals showed swollen lymph glands and night sweats.\nThey also frequently contracted an unusual malignancy - Kaposi's sarcoma (a proliferation of\ncells lining the small blood vessels) - which until then had been encountered in the U.S. only on\nrare occasion and then in old men of Mediterranean (Italian, Greek, Jewish) extraction.\n\nThese young men were clearly immuno-deficient, in that they suffered from a variety of\nopportunistic infections, that is, infections by pathogens that surround us constantly, waiting for\nthe opportunity to overwhelm the normally very effective immune defense that our bodies have\nerected. Moreover, the frequency and geographic occurrence of the disease, specifically its\nAIDS and the Immune System\n\nclustering in a small, relatively homogeneous population having a shared lifestyle, suggested that\nthe disease was triggered by some type of infectious agent.\n\nWithin a two years period of time, the agent responsible for causing the disease, initially called\nHTLV-III or LAV, was isolated in two laboratories - that of Robert Gallo of the U.S. National\nCancer Institute (HTLV-III) and that of Luc Montagnier (LAV) in Paris. The present term, HIV,\nfor human immunodeficiency virus was chosen as a compromise in nomenclature between the\ntwo warring camps, each of whom claimed priority in the discovery of the virus and thus the\nright to name it.\n\nEarlier Retrovirus Research\n\nHow did we come to discover the agent for AIDS so quickly? The lag between the description\nof a disease and the elucidation of its causative agent encompassed only two short years, almost\nunprecedented in the history of biomedical research. Usually decades have intervened between\nthese two events.\n\nBy 1981, we were already well-poised to understand the nature of the infectious agent for AIDS\nfor two important reasons: In 1971, President Nixon signed the War on Cancer Bill, which\nauthorized the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to step up its attempts to find the causes of cancer\n- thought then to be retroviruses. The result was an intensive, decade-long study of retroviruses\nby many research groups, the result of which was a large corpus of information on retrovirus\nreplication and a convincing proof that retroviruses were not the cause of most human\nmalignancies, as many had anticipated.\n\nThe second factor was the continuing obsession of Robert Gallo of the NCI that retroviruses\nwere common in humans and were responsible for a wide variety of malignancies. Even after\ntheir role as causative agents in human cancers had been disproven, he persisted in his attempts\nto find retroviruses in all types of human pathologic tissues. Thus, when the AIDS syndrome\nwas first discovered, he responded with his usual conviction that it was a disease having, as its\ncausative agent, a retrovirus.\n\nRetroviruses and their Replicative Cycle\n\nRetroviruses have a most unusual life cycle that we review here in some detail, having discussed\nit briefly earlier in the semester. Recall that all viruses are really gene packets that move from\ncell to cell, entering a host cell and making more copies of their genes in the infected host cell.\nDozens, hundreds, or thousands of progeny particles may result from such multiplication. The\nprogeny virus particles then leave the infected host and proceed to infect other host cells nearby,\ncontinuing the infectious cycle.\n\nThe viral genome, either RNA or DNA, controls the ability of the virus to enter cells and\nmultiply within them. In the case of retroviruses, a large class of structurally (and\nevolutionarily) related viruses, the viral genomes are single-stranded RNA molecules, which\nhave plus-stranded polarity. Being (+) stranded, the viral RNA molecules can serve as mRNAs\nwhen associated with ribosomes.\nAIDS and the Immune System\n\nRecall as well that virus particles, also known as virions, are composed of the viral genomes\nsurrounded by a coat. The virion coat has two functions: to protect the viral nucleic acid genome\nfrom destruction while the virus particle passes from cell to cell, and to introduce the viral\ngenome into an infected host cell, much as a hypodermic needle injects fluid into tissue.\nIntroduction of the virion into cells involves several steps, including the initial tethering of the\nvirion to the surface of the host cell, and the subsequent physical insertion of the viral genome\ninto the host cytoplasm, a process that requires a penetration through the plasma membrane of\nthe cell. In the case of retroviruses, the virion coat, like many other viruses, is composed of a\nlipid bilayer. Protruding from the lipid bilayer are a series of glycoprotein spikes. The latter are\nused by the virion for tethering to host cells.\n\nThe initial tethering (adsorption) of the virus to an infectable target cell occurs through the\nability of the viral glycoprotein spikes to bind to specific glycoproteins displayed on the surface\nof the target cell. Such a target cell protein is termed a receptor for the virus. The cell receptor\nis always a normal cellular protein that the cell uses routinely for its own biological purposes.\nViruses take advantage of these pre-existing cell surface proteins and evolve an affinity for them,\nexploiting them as convenient docking sites on the cell surface.\n\nAfter the virus tethers itself to the surface of the target cell via the receptor molecules, the virion\nmust insert its internal contents into the cytoplasm of the target cell. In fact, the innards of the\nretrovirus virion are composed of more than the single-stranded viral genomic RNA. In\naddition, a series of viral proteins is assembled in a quasi-geometric icosahedron (much like a\nBuckminster Fuller construction). The RNA together with the surrounding icosahedral protein\nlayer is called the viral nucleocapsid.\n\nOnce tethered to the surface, the virus must fuse its own lipid bilayer with the lipid bilayer\nforming the plasma membrane of the target cell. Only then can the nucleocapsid be injected into\nthe cell cytoplasm. This fusion is also mediated by the viral glycoprotein spikes that were\ninvolve in the initial tethering. Once the fusion has occurred, the viral nucleocapsid now is\nfirmly ensconced in the cytoplasm of the host cell.\n\nIn the case of retroviruses, the nucleocapsid actually carries more than the viral genomic RNA.\nIt also contains a copying enzyme, the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. Once the\nnucleocapsid is in the cytoplasm, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates made by the cell percolate\ninto it. This allows the RT enzyme to be activated. It now begins to copy the viral genomic\nRNA.\n\nThe process of reverse transcription, as carried out by the RT is more complicated than when the\nenzyme is used by reasearches as a reagent to make cDNAs from an mRNA template. To begin,\na (-) stranded cDNA copy of the (+) stranded viral RNA is made. Then, the RT enzyme\ndegrades the RNA portion of the DNA:RNA hybrid formed by the initial reverse transcription.\nFinally, the RT enzyme makes a (+) stranded DNA using the initially formed (-) stranded DNA\nas template. The end result is a DNA double-stranded helix that contains all the viral genetic\ninformation.\n\nThis viral DNA is then released from the nucleocapsid, transported into the nucleus, and\ncovalently inserted into the host cell chromosomal DNA. Such insertion, the process of\nAIDS and the Immune System\n\nintegration, involves cutting and pasting by another virus-encoded enzyme. This enzyme makes\na cut at a randomly chosen site in the host cell chromosome and then links the ends of the linear\nviral DNA (recently synthesized by reverse transcription) to the cut ends of the chromosomal\nDNA. The resulting integrated viral genome, termed the provirus, now assumes a molecular\nconfiguration equivalent to that of a cellular gene. The provirus can be transcribed by host cell\nRNA polymerase II, the resulting viral RNA transcripts can be polyadenylated, spliced where\nneeded, and exported into the cytoplasm.\n\nThese newly synthesized viral transcripts in the cytoplasm can have two alternative fates. If they\nare unspliced, genomic length RNA, they may be packaged in progeny nucleocapsids. These\nwill then be pushed through the host cell plasma membrane, during which process the lipid\nbilayer and glycoprotein spikes are acquired. This allows the newly formed virus particle to\nleave the infected cell and go on to infect other cells. Alternatively, the cytoplasmic viral RNA\nmay serve as mRNA templates for the synthesis of progeny virus proteins. Some of these\ncytoplasmic RNAs may be spliced prior to export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This\nsplicing allows a number of distinct reading frames in the viral genomic RNA to be fused to the\n5' end of the viral transcript, resulting in a number of distinct mRNAs and hence distinct viral\nproteins.\n\nAn aside: The translation of the viral proteins takes place at two sites in the cytoplasm. The (spliced subgenomic)\nmRNA encoding the viral glycoprotein spikes is translated on ribosomes associated with the rough endoplasmic\nreticulum, and these proteins are inserted into the ER, glycosylated, and exported via the Golgi apparatus to the\ncell surface. The other viral mRNAs, which make soluble proteins (which form the nucleoprotein core and the\nreverse transcriptase) are associated with free polyribosomes in the cytoplasm. The viral gene encoding the\nglycoprotein spikes is often termed env (the virion envelope), that encoding the nucleocapsid core is termed gag\n(for group-specific antigens), while that encoding the reverse transcriptase is called pol (for polymerase).\n\nConsequences of the Retrovirus Replication Cycle\n\nThe unusual replication cycle of the virus places it in an especially intimate relationship with the\ncell that it infects, particularly with the cell genome. Here are some of the consequences of this\npeculiar life cycle:\n\nPersistent infections\nIf the viral infection does not rapidly kill the cell, which is indeed the case with many types of\nretrovirus infectious cycles, then the virus can persist, in the initially infected cell for an\nindefinite period of time. For example, the infected cell may produce progeny virus particles for\nan indefinite period of time at a slow, steady rate. Also, since the viral genome, its provirus, is\nintegrated into the host cell chromosome, the provirus can be replicated and transmitted like all\nother cellular genes to progeny cells. Hence, the descendants of an initially infected cell can\ninherit the provirus and they may continue to produce virus particles like the initially infected\ncell did.\n\nLatency\nThe provirus, once integrated into the host cell chromosome, may be immediately transcribed,\nresulting in the release of progeny virus particles, or it may be transcriptionally repressed. This\nwill cause the provirus to participate in a latent infection in which its presence will be inapparent\nAIDS and the Immune System\n\n(since no viral proteins, RNA or virus particles will be produced). Some time later, a\nphysiologic signal may awake the provirus from its dormant, latent state, causing it to be\ntranscribed after months or years of silence, resulting suddenly in the expression of viral proteins\nand release of virus particles from a cell that seemed, until that moment, to be uninfected.\n\nGermline transmission\nSome retroviruses may infect germ cells (in the ovaries and testes). As a consequence, the\nresulting proviruses may be transmitted via sperm or egg to the next generation of organisms,\nand thereafter to all lineal descendants. In effect, the provirus has become a Mendelian gene.\nSuch endogenous proviruses may then be activated in an animal that has inherited them,\nresulting in the release of virus particles which may then spread through its tissues via normal\ninfectious cycles. Mice, chickens and cats have many such endogenous proviruses. For reasons\nthat are unclear, no new proviruses have been inserted into the human germline for the past 5-10\nmillion years (although they were before then into the germlines of our ape-like ancestors).\nThus, HIV is spread, as far as we know, exclusively through horizontal transmission, that is,\nfrom one person to another rather than genetically (vertically) from parent to offspring.\n\nHIV infection of T lymphocytes\n\nWith all this in mind, how does the retrovirus growth cycle help us to understand the process of\nAIDS pathogenesis (the process of causing disease)? To begin, we note that HIV-1 (one of the\nstrains of HIV), like many other viruses, has a narrow host range. That is, it infects only a\nlimited range of cells in the body; moreover, it infects only certain Old World monkeys as well\nas ourselves. In this sense, it is a highly specialized virus.\n\nThe cells that HIV-1 infects include largely the helper T cells, certain cells in the monocyte-\nmacrophage lineage, and certain other cell types. We will focus here on its effects on TH cells\nthat were described earlier. They are the main targets of HIV attack. Soon after the discovery of\nAIDS, it became apparent that AIDS patients are immunodeficient in large part because they\nhave low and sometimes non-existent helper T cells in their circulation. This suggested that TH\ncells were eliminated in some way by the AIDS agent.\n\nSome years later, it became apparent why and how HIV specifically targets the helper T cells:\nthe receptor that it uses to tether to target cells is the CD4 protein. As described above, T cells\nassociate with both macrophages and B cells. The CD4 protein normally helps the T cell to dock\nto these two classes of cells. Therefore, HIV virus exploits a normal TH lymphocyte protein as a\nreceptor for binding itself to its target cell.\n\nThe CD4 protein is present largely, but not exclusively on TH cells. Infection of TH cells by\nHIV can be blocked if monoclonal antibody made against CD4 is added to these lymphocytes\nprior to attack by HIV. The anti-CD4 antibody, by covering up the CD4 molecule, prevents HIV\nparticles from accessing the CD4 and tethering themselves to the TH cell surface. Moreover,\ncertain human cells that are usually not infectable by HIV-1 can be converted to infectable cells\nby introducing a cloned CD4 gene into these cells, thereby forcing them to express CD4 on their\nsurface. This might suggest a useful anti-HIV therapy, in which the CD4 proteins of infected T\ncells are blocked with some protective antibody. But that would not be a useful strategy, since it\nAIDS and the Immune System\n\nwould prevent these TH cells from having normal interactions with macrophages and B cells that\nare essential for maintenance of the normal immune response.\n\nHIV may enter into a T lymphocyte and become latent by being transcriptionally silent. Thus,\nthe HIV provirus contains at its left (5' end) a transcription promoter termed LTR. The viral\nLTR promoter contains within it a DNA sequence that serves as a binding site for the cellular\ntranscription factor NF-kB. In resting T lymphocytes, this cellular transcription factor is\nunavailable. However, if the T lymphocytes becomes functionally activated (as described, for\nexample, earlier), then the T lymphocytes begin to make active NF-kB transcription factor as\npart of their normal activation response. This transcription factor then binds to the viral RNA\npromoter (along with binding to other cellular gene promoters), helps to turn on transcription of\nthe provirus, thereby activating and revealing the hitherto latent viral infection.\n\nThe consequences of this latency are important for the viral infectious cycle. The ability of the\nimmune system to eliminate infecting viral pathogens like HIV depends in large part on the\nability of the immune system to recognize and kill virus-infected cells. But if many helper TH\ncells contain a latent, unexpressed HIV proviruses, then these cells will escape killing by the\nimmune system because they are phenotypically normal and outwardly have the appearance of\nbeing uninfected. These latently infected cells may harbor the viral infection for years and there\nis no way of knowing where they are in the body and there is no means of selectively eliminating\nthese cells. Months or years later, when a physiologic stimulus (e.g. antigenic stimulation)\nshould activate such a latently infected T cell, the virus may then pop out suddenly and trigger\nrounds of infection. This explains the difficulty of totally ridding the body of HIV once it has\nestablished itself.\n\nAntigenic Variability\n\nThe easiest way for the immune system to recognize either an HIV particle or an HIV-infected\ncell is through the presence of the viral glycoprotein spikes that protrude from the HIV virion\nand from the plasma membrane of infected cells.\nRecall that:\n1) the infected cell membrane displays these viral glycoproteins;\n2) the viral nucleocapsid in the cytoplasm forces its way through the plasma membrane; and\n3) in the course of pushing its way out of the cell, the nucleocapsid coats itself with a lipid bilayer\ncontaining these viral glycoprotein spikes.)\n\nThe viral glycoprotein contains several regions that are highly antigenic, that is, attract most of\nthe attention of the immune system by eliciting antibody responses. Once the immune system\nmakes antibodies against the viral glycoprotein antigenic regions, these antibodies can either\nbind to virus particles and neutralize/inactivate them or they can bind to the surface of HIV-\ninfected cells, facilitating the elimination of these infected cells by other immune cells (such as\nmacrophages). This explains why the production of anti-virion antibody is useful in establishing\nan anti-viral response.\n\nHowever, the virus makes itself into a moving target that is continually eluding the immune\nsystem. In particular, HIV is capable of changing the amino acid sequences of these antigenic\nregions of the glycoprotein spikes from month to month and year to year - a form of constant\nmicrobial guerrilla warfare. This continually results in the appearance of new variant strains of\nAIDS and the Immune System\n\nHIV in an infected individual that are no longer recognized by the existing repertoire of\nantibodies that this person's immune system has mustered until then. As soon as his/her immune\nsystem has a chance to make antibody against one variant of the glycoprotein, the virus pops up\nwith a novel glycoprotein version. The new version is not recognized by the existing antibody\nand as a consequence, escapes antibody attack until the immune system catches up with it days\nor weeks later. Poliovirus, by contrast, is not antigenically variable and immunity established\nagainst one form of poliovirus results in lifelong protection against reinfection.\n\nThis changeability of the viral glycoprotein antigen is made possible by the mutability of the\nviral genome. The reverse transcriptase enzyme is rather sloppy, creating frequent copying errors\nduring reverse transcription. This leads in turn to a high frequency of mutant glycoprotein genes,\nsome of which specify novel antigenic variants of HIV that escape existing immune defenses and\nmultiply unhindered for a period of time until the immune system catches up with them.\n\nFor this reason, the progression of an HIV infection over many years is marked by a series of\nepisodes in which the virus bursts out, replicates, is brought under control by the immune\nresponse, only to have a new round of infection start up by an antigenic variant months later.\nEventually the immune system's defenses are worn down to the point that HIV replication is\nunimpeded. By this time, the helper T cells have become so depleted (see below) that the body\nis now wide open for attack by a variety of viral, bacterial, and fungal agents that create the\ndevastating infections seen in AIDS patients.\n\nCell Killing\n\nUnexplained by all this is the mechanism by which HIV actually kills helper T cells that it has\ninfected. The very process of making progeny virus particles is lethal for many types of virus-\ninfected cells. In the case of poliovirus, the process of making hundreds of thousands of viral\nprogeny particles depletes the cell of many of its normally required macromolecules. But in the\ncase of HIV infection, the mechanisms of the viral cytopathic effects are more varied and subtle.\n\nOne explanation of HIV's cytopathic effects comes from a reexamination of the functions of the\nviral glycoprotein. Recall that in addition to its ability to adsorb to a cell surface by tethering to\nthe CD4 protein, the glycoprotein also has an ability to fuse the lipid membrane of the virion\nwith the plasma membrane of the infectable target cell. In the case of a helper T cell that is\nactively producing progeny virus particles, its plasma membrane is studded with HIV\nglycoprotein spikes, many of which will eventually be picked up by progeny HIV particles on\ntheir way out of the cell.\n\nThese viral spikes may already be functionally active while they are on the surface of the virus-\ninfected cell, even before they have become incorporated into progeny virus particles. The\nconsequences of this can be devastating for the cell. First, they will cause the surface of the\nvirus-infected cell to adsorb to that of other, still uninfected helper T cells displaying CD4\nprotein on their surface. Second, the fusogenic activity of the viral glycoprotein spike will cause\nthis cell to fuse with such uninfected helper T cells. Indeed, this cycle can be repeated over and\nover, resulting in the fusion of the infected cell with dozens if not hundreds of uninfected helper\nT cells. The results with be a multi-nucleated syncytium which is non-viable. The cells in such\na syncytium will die after several days.\nAIDS and the Immune System\n\nThe History of an HIV infection\n\nWe can now assemble and integrate all of the above information into a reasonably coherent\npicture of how HIV begins its infectious cycle in an individual. It is usually transmitted from\nperson to person through blood or semen. In both cases, the bulk of the transmission seems to\noccur by passage of infected cells rather than by free-floating virus particles.\n\nOnce inside the body, virus is released from the introduced infected cells, largely infected TH\ncells. HIV begins rounds of infection, largely in the TH cells of the lymphoid organs (e.g. lymph\nglands, spleen) of its newfound host. This results in an acute phase infection, in which high viral\ntiters (high concentration of free virus in the blood) can be detected in the recently infected\nindividual several weeks post-infection. After several more weeks, the viral titer drops\nprecipitously. This is drop is due to an immune response that the still largely intact immune\nsystem of the host individual mounts. Two immunologic mechanisms are used to reduce the\nviral titer: cytotoxic T lymphocytes (TC cells) are produced which kill off the great majority of\nHIV-infected TH cells. Later on, the B cells of the host produce high titers of anti-HIV antibody.\n\nNow the HIV infection goes underground, or at least seems to. Large numbers of latently\ninfected TH cells can be found for a number of years. While the viral titer in the blood is\nreduced, actively replication of HIV continues however in a number of lymphoid organs such as\nlymph glands. In such individuals, as many as 107 to 109 virions may be produced per day and\neliminated (perhaps by antibody neutralization) almost as soon as they are produced. Occasional\nflare-ups of high viral titers (viremia) may occur as HIV variants evolve new glycoprotein\nantigens and temporarily evade the existing immune response. All the while, as many as 2 x 109\nTH may be killed throughout the body each day!\n\nFor a number of years (highly variable from one infected individual to another), this enormous\ndeath rate of TH cells is compensated by an equally large proliferation of TH cells, resulting in a\nsemblance of a stable, steady-state infection. Sooner or later, however, the ability of the immune\nsystem to replenish the ranks of the TH cells is exhausted, often irreversibly. Then the number of\nTH cells plummets and the overall functioning of the immune system collapses, for reasons\ndescribed earlier. One of the first consequences is the inability of the immune system to\ncontinue to suppress the HIV infection, leading the virus to break through the immune defense\nbarriers that have held it in check for years.\n\nSoon opportunistic infections by other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens strike various sites\nthroughout the body. The Kaposi's sarcoma frequently observed in homosexuals but rarely in\nthose infected by blood transfusions may be caused by sexual transmission of a recently\ndiscovered herpes virus-like agent termed HHV-8. Lymphomas may also occur at high rates, a\ncommon occurrence in individuals with a compromised immune system. These days, lifespan\nand a reasonable quality of existence can be extended for a number of years using antibiotics,\nantifungal agents, and chemotherapy, converting AIDS into a chronic disease for this period.\nBut in the great majority of cases (>99%), the end is clear, sad and inescapable.\nAIDS and the Immune System"

      "content": "Growth and Differentiation:\nthe Case of Hematopoiesis\n\nAs we have mentioned on several occasions this semester, there is a marked contrast between the\ngenotypes of the cells in our body and their phenotypes. Almost all the cells in our body have an\nidentical genotype - an identical set of genes. Yet the phenotypes of cells in our body are highly\nvariable. The only way to reconcile these two apparently contradictory facts is to assume that\nthe genotype of our cells contains much more information than is used by any one particular cell.\nIn other words, different cells consult the common genomic library in different ways.\n\nDifferentiation\n\nWe imagine that during the early development of an embryo, cells in different parts of the\nembryo decide on which parts of their genome they will use to program their future lifestyles,\ntheir future phenotypes. This selective reading of the genome means that each distinct cell type\nwill only consult a subset of the genes that are carried in its genome. The embryologic processes\nthat allow cells to assume distinct phenotypes, phenotypes that distinguish them from other cells\ncoexisting in the same embryo is termed differentiation.\n\nWe can imagine that as the fertilized egg divides into 2 cells, then 4 then 8 and so forth, the cells\nin this ever-increasing population decide on what their individual differentiated fates will be.\nThis decision commits the embryonic cell to a distinct differentiation pathway that will affect not\nonly this cell itself, but all of its lineal descendants as well. The line of descendants that leads\nfrom this early embryonic cell to its descendants is also called a differentiation lineage.\n\nAs an example, we might speculate that early in the development of an embryo, one cell decides\nthat it will become the ancestor of all the blood-forming (hematopoietic) cells in the body.\nAnother cell may commit to becoming the ancestor of all the nerve cells in the body; and yet\nanother may become the ancestor of all the connective tissue cells. Importantly, the lineal\ndescendants of these early embryonic cells will continue to respect the decision made by their\nearly embryonic ancestor. Thus, the descendants of the embryonic cell that committed itself to\nbecome a blood-forming cell will, many cell generations later, continue to be specialized for the\nprocesses of blood formation.\n\nThis scheme immediately provokes two major questions, neither of which we can answer for the\nmoment. First, how does a given cell in the embryo choose its fate and that of its descendants?\nAn early, still undifferentiated embryonic cell can pick and choose among many distinct\ndifferentiation pathways. What factors and what information persuade it to choose one fate\nrather than another?\n\nSecond, after an early embryonic cell has decided its own fate, how is this decision remembered\nby its descendants? How does a particular cell 30 or 40 cell generations later know that its early\nancestor was committed to a distinct differentiation pathway?\nWe might speculate that each time a cell commits itself to a particular differentiation lineage, its\ngenome is mutated in a specific way, ensuring that this decision will be perpetuated in the DNA\nsequences of its genes. But in fact, this does not happen. The nucleated cells in different tissues\npossess identical genomes. Therefore, we conclude that differentiation decisions are transmitted\nfrom one cell generation to the next via mechanisms that do not involve changes in the structure\n(sequence) of the DNA.\nCell Growth and Differentiation\n\n7.012 Fall 2004\nMIT Biology Department\n7.012: Introductory Biology - Fall 2004\nInstructors: Professor Eric Lander, Professor Robert A. Weinberg, Dr. Claudette Gardel\n\nLet's focus for a moment on the first problem. In doing so, we must assume that a complicated\nseries of signals persuades an early embryonic cell to commit itself to take on one or another\ndifferentiated state. What kind of information could this cell use?\n\nPositional information\n\nA cell may use positional information when committing to a particular differentiation lineage.\nYou can imagine that a cell knows or remembers what region of the fertilized egg it arose from.\nDifferent regions of the egg may be chemically distinct from one another and this distinctness\nmay be passed on to the cells that descend from these different regions. Alternatively, a cell that\nis deciding how to differentiate may sense what part of the embryo it is located in. Such\npositional information may help a cell decide what it and its descendants should become. For\nexample, a cell that finds itself in the outer layers of the embryo might decide to become the\nancestor of skin cells while a cell in the middle of the embryo might decide to become ancestor\nto the cells that will form the gut.\n\nHow might a cell sense its own position in the embryo? We have a clue to this puzzle. Cells in\nan embryo concern themselves with the identities of their nearby neighbors. The identities of\nthese neighbors govern its perceptions about its own position in the embryo.\n\nGrowth factors\n\nIf position is determined by neighboring cells, how does a cell ascertain the identities of its\nneighbors? A cell will communicate with its nearby neighbors by releasing and/or receiving the\nprotein molecules that we previously termed growth factors, (GFs). Previously, we discussed\nGFs in the context of decisions made by cells whether they should grow or not. GFs were\ndepicted as mitogens (agents that induce mitosis), and as such convey a binary signal. When\nGFs are present, they induce a cell to grow; when they are absent, the cell does not grow. Now\nwe want to add more richness to the information that they carry: maybe some GFs can also carry\ninformation that persuades a cell to differentiate in one direction or another.\n\nRecall that GFs operate as inter-cellular messengers that convey information from one cell to\nanother through their presence or absence. Several dozen distinct growth factors have been\ndiscovered to date*. Each is a protein molecule, usually of relatively small size (100 amino\nacids or less). A given cell may release several distinct growth factors and respond to a number\nof others. This means that the positional information received by a cell might be provided by the\ncombinatorial mix of growth factor signals that it receives from its surrounding space, each of\nthese factors having been released by one or more of the neighbors that surround it.\n\n*Examples of GFs are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF),\nfibroblast growth factor (FGF), tumor growth factor- (TGF-) and a series of growth factors\nthat are specialized to affect hematopoietic cells and are called interleukins.\n\nAt least 14 distinct interleukins have been found, each having its own specific amino acid sequence.\nEach of these various growth factors/interleukins is released by one cell type and impinges upon a\nsecond cell type which senses its presence and responds in one or another way.\n\nReplenishing the ranks\n\nCell Growth and Differentiation\n\n7.012 Fall 2004\n\nWe can understand some of the features of embryonic decision-making by looking at the process\nof blood formation that occurs in the adult bone marrow and spleen where most of the red and\nwhite cells of our blood are formed. The picture that we have painted until now suggests that\ncells decide early during embryonic development about differentiation fates; their differentiated\ndescendants then form the tissues in the later embryo, in the newborn, and ultimately in the\nadult. Why now are we suddenly talking about differentiation occurring in an adult, long after\nembryogenesis?\n\nIn fact, all throughout embryonic development and through our entire lives, we continue to carry\nwithin our bodies large numbers of undifferentiated cells that retain the potential to commit\nthemselves to specific differentiation pathways. You might think of these as primitive,\nundifferentiated embryonic cells that remain throughout life scattered about the body. Blood\nforming cells are particularly attractive to study experimentally because they are so plentiful; as\nmany as 1010 blood cell progeny are formed in an hour. For this reason, undifferentiated blood\nforming cell precursors are a highly useful experimental model for certain early embryonic\nprocesses.\n\nThe reason for the continued presence of primitive, undifferentiated cells in our body is simple\nand straightforward. The cells in almost all of our organs are constantly wearing out**. Some\ncells have lifetimes of days, yet others live weeks, months or years. When these cells die, they\nmust be replaced by an equivalent number of new cells. These replacements are usually newly\ndifferentiated cells that are recruited to fill the ranks of their recently fallen comrades.\n\n**Red blood cells in humans have lifetimes of about 120 days. Blood platelets have lifetimes of\nseveral days. Skin cells have a lifetime of several weeks. As red blood cells, platelets, and skin\ncells die, newly differentiated cells of the same type are produced. An exception to this picture\nis in the brain. Unlike virtually all other organs, when nerve cells (neurons) in the adult brain\ndie, they are not replaced, resulting in a slow steady loss of a hundred thousand or more\nneurons a day and inexorable shrinkage of brain power!\n\nOne way to replace a missing, recently departed skin or blood cell might be to induce a\nsurviving, differentiated skin cell to grow and divide into two. But this rarely happens for a very\nimportant reason: most cell types that become highly differentiated give up the option of ever\ndividing again. Thus, in many organs in the body, the highly differentiated, specialized cells are\npost-mitotic. They may be viable and healthy, but they have lost the ability to divide (go\nthrough mitosis) again. If their ranks are going to be replenished by new recruits, these new\nrecruits must arise through the growth and division of those cells within the organ that retain the\nability to grow and divide. Only cells, called stem cells, have remained undifferentiated and\nretain the option to divide.\n\nStem cells: mothers and daughters\n\nThe primitive, undifferentiated stem cells are scattered about in various of the body. When a\nstem cell divides, its daughters have two possible fates. One or both daughter cells may assume\nthe undifferentiated phenotype of their mother, or alternatively, one or both daughters may\ndecide to take on a more differentiated phenotype. In fact, it is usually the case that at least one\ndaughter cell retains the phenotype of the mother cell.\n\nThe logic of this binary decision-making is clear. In general, an organ or tissue wants to\nmaintain rather constant numbers (pools) of stem cells and differentiated cells. The one daughter\nthat retains the phenotype of the mother stem cell becomes itself a new stem cell, ensuring that\nthe total number of stem cells does not change. The other daughter cell, by choosing to\nCell Growth and Differentiation\n\n7.012 Fall 2004\n\ndifferentiate, replenishes the pool of differentiated cells whose presence is essential for the\nfunctioning of a tissue.\n\nWhy, in fact, does a tissue wish to maintain a constant, minimum number of stem cells? Again\nthe logic is simple: stem cells constitute a safety back-up for the tissue. Normal tissue can lose\nsome of its differentiated cells by normal attrition (i.e. wear and tear) or by damage or injury.\nWhen this occurs the tissue can call upon its stem cell population to divide and create progeny\nthat will rapidly repopulate the temporarily depleted ranks of the differentiated cells within the\ntissue. If both daughter cells of an undifferentiated stem cell chose to differentiate, then the\ntissue or organ would lose a cell from its stem cell compartment. If this occurred repeatedly, the\nstem cell compartment would be depleted and the tissue would lose its ability to repair and\nreplenish itself.\n\nMultiple differentiation pathways\n\nMore often than not, the cells that form a given tissue or organ are representatives of several\ndistinct differentiated cell types. These distinct cell types coexist with one another and\ncollaborate to create the functional organ. Importantly, in many such organs, these various\ndistinctive cell types may all descend from a common stem cell precursor. There are exceptions\nto this. In the liver most of the cells hepatocytes or muscle cells, and the contractile tissue is\ncomposed of cells identical to one another.\n\nConsequently, we can imagine at least one dimension of greater complexity beyond that\ndescribed above: when stem cells differentiate they may choose several distinct differentiation\npathways. What external stimuli might influence a stem cell to choose one differentiation\npathway rather than another? For the moment, we can speculate that certain growth factors\nencountered by the stem cell may induce them to choose one or another pathway of\ndifferentiation. Evidence for this will follow later.\n\nIn blood cells§ we have a dramatic example a common stem cell becoming the ancestor of a\nmultitude of distinct cell types including a variety of white blood cells as well as the red cells\n(erythrocytes). As listed below, there are as many as 9 different blood cell types in the body.\nSome of these, such as T lymphocytes, are further divided into sub-classes that play distinct roles\nin the immune system.\n\nThe full complexity of the hematopoietic system can be understood in terms of the multiple\nfunctions of blood cells. They serve several basic functions: to transport gases (erythrocytes), to\nprevent bleeding by forming blood clots (platelets), and to form an immune defense system that\nprotects us against a variety of foreign infectious agents and irritants (all the rest).\n\n§We normally think of a tissue or organ as being a solid mass such as the kidney or the liver or the\nbrain. Blood is also a tissue, but the constituent cells that form blood happen to be single, circulating\ncells rather than cells that form a solid, physical mass. The dispersed nature of the blood cells\nthroughout the body in no way detracts from the fact that the cells in the hematopoietic system\nconstitute a single interacting organ system.\n\nIt is also important to note that not all of the blood cells are in fact free found throughout our\ncirculatory system. Some of cells spend extended periods of time in solid organ host tissues. Many\nof the precursor, undifferentiated cells live in the bone marrow and spleen. The thymus (at the base\nof our throat) and the lymph nodes (scattered throughout the body) are homes for many lymphocyte\npopulations.\n\nCell Growth and Differentiation\n\n7.012 Fall 2004\n\nInventory of the cell types in blood: (per liter of blood)\n\nRed blood cells (erythrocytes): transport CO2 and O2.

(1 x 108 cells)\n\nPlatelets are cell fragments that derive from megakaryocyte precursors. They initiate\nblood clotting. (3 x 1011 \"cells\")\n\nA multi-talented cell\n\nThe average person creates 3-10 billion red cells, platelets, and neutrophils per hour! This\nrepresents an enormous biosynthetic effort. How is all this arranged and regulated? As we will\nsee, blood cell formation represents a highly controlled system that regulates both mitogenic\nactivity and differentiation decisions.\n\nThere is compelling evidence that the wide array of blood cells derives from a single common\nprecursor. This cell is termed a pluripotent stem cell to denote the fact that it has the potential to\ndifferentiate into a multitude of distinct cell types. Importantly, the pluripotent stem cell does not\nitself differentiate directly into all of the end-stage, highly differentiate progeny in a single step.\nRather, we see a multi-step hierarchy involving a number of intermediate cell types. The fact\nthat there are cells at various stages of differentiation means that we can no longer speak simply\nin terms of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Instead, there are degrees of differentiation.\n\nCell Growth and Differentiation\n\n7.012 Fall 2004\n\nA highly branched family tree\n\nThe pluripotent stem cell can replenish itself or it can spawn two distinct types of daughter cells,\none in the lymphoid lineage, the other in the myeloid (marrow) lineage. Each of these daughter\ncells has itself just begun the differentiation pathway. Although committed to either the\nlymphoid or the myeloid lineage, each of these daughters retains a stem cell phenotype in the\nsense that it retains the option of replenishing itself. Thus, we learn that the daughter of a stem\ncell may itself be another kind of stem cell, but one that has already limited its options.\n\nThe lymphoid lineage is initially associated with the thymus where two types of lymphocytes, B-\nlymphocytes and T-lymphocytes may develop. Each of these takes on specific functions in the\nimmune system. The end stage T and B lymphocytes are not created in one step from their\nlymphoid stem cell precursor. Instead, there are intermediate, less-differentiated cell types are\nformed along the path toward the end stage cells. Note that lymphocytes, unlike almost all other\nhighly differentiated cell types, retain the option of dividing.\n\nThe myeloid stem cell lineage is much more complex. There are least five different sub-\nlineages. Among these is the erythrocyte (red cell) lineage. An additional three lineages -\neosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils/macrophages are devoted to various aspects of\nrecognizing and gobbling up invading infectious agents or cells that have been infected by such\nagents and need to be destroyed. Another lineage leads the megakaryocytes that form the small,\nanucleate platelets that participate in forming clots. Cytoplasmic fragments are budded off the\nplasma membranes of megakaryocytes to yield the small, anucleate platelets that participate in\nforming clots.\n\nBone marrow transplants\n\nHow can we prove that the pluripotent stem cell is more than a figment of some biologist's fertile\nimagination? The procedure of bone marrow transplantation makes this possible. In such a\nprocedure, a mouse is irradiated with X-rays. These X-rays are delivered at a dose such that all\nof the bone marrow stem cells are wiped out. These cells turn out to be more sensitive to X-ray\nkilling than other stem cells throughout the body. Consequently, it is possible to find a dose of\nX-rays that kills bone marrow cells but leaves the remaining tissues of the mouse intact.\n\nSuch irradiation is usually lethal because most of the blood cell types turn over relatively rapidly\nand need to be replaced continually. For this reason, the death of precursor stem cells places the\nmouse in a precarious position. It will quickly run out of platelets to form clots and lymphocytes\nto fight infections. The longer-lived red blood cells are more gradually depleted.\n\nThese mice can be rescued by injection of a small number of marrow cells prepared from a\nnormal, untreated donor mouse. After injection, these donor cells migrate into the depleted bone\nmarrow of the irradiated mouse. Physiological signals indicate a need for many types of\ndifferentiated cells and begin to divide frenetically. Over several weeks, the donor stem cell\nprogeny expand exponentially and replenish the marrow and the various compartments of end\nstage differentiated cells. Once the various differentiated cell types in the blood have been\nreplenished, the stem cells revert to their normal, lower level of activity. Of course, the same\nprocesses can be envisioned in human beings subjected to bone marrow transplantation.\n\nCell Growth and Differentiation\n\n7.012 Fall 2004\n\nThe elusive pluripotent stem cell\n\nThe fact that a small number of donor bone marrow cells can rescue a lethally irradiated mouse\n(or human) suggests but does not prove that a single precursor stem cell has pluripotency, i.e.,\nthe ability to spawn multiple differentiated cell lineages.\n\nPluripotency can be proven creating a population of normal stem cells, such that each cell is\nmarked with a distinctive tag. Such tagging involves attaching a unique genetic sequence to\neach of the thousands of cells in the stem cell where no two tags are the same.\n\nHow can cells be tagged in such a fashion? One method uses a light dose of X-rays. This light\ndose will not kill the donor stem cells but instead will create a small amount of genetic damage\nin each cell. Included in this damage will be random breaks and rearrangements of\nchromosomes that can be seen under the light microscope. As a consequence, each of the donor\ncells in such a lightly irradiated population will have a distinctive, unique chromosomal\nabnormality that serves to distinguish it from its sister cells in the population.\n\nA small number of these randomly tagged donor stem cells can then be injected into a lethally\nirradiated animal. These cells will enter into the marrow of the irradiated animal and begin to\nrepopulate it, thereby rescuing the animal from death. Subsequently, the various blood cells\ntypes of the now-rescued animal can be examined for chromosomal abnormalities. If different\nblood cell types in the rescued animal (e.g. eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) all carry the\nsame unique chromosomal abnormality (distinctive tag), then all the blood cells descended from\nthe same common ancestral pluripotent stem cell (a cell that also carried this unique abnormality,\nhaving acquired it following the light X-ray treatment). Hence, we can conclude that this\nancestor was capable of spawning a diverse array of descendant cells that populated the entire\nbone marrow. Indeed, this is just what is observed after doing such an experiment.\n\nHomeostasis - a balancing act\n\nThe pool sizes of each distinct type of blood cell must be kept under careful control. If there are\ntoo many of a given type, then a leukemia (a blood cancer) will occur. If there are too few, than\nthe animal or person will die from insufficient gas transport (anemia) or from an overwhelming\ninfection because of the absence of immune system cells.\n\nThe process by which the number of cells (or other vital physiologic components) is kept under\ncareful, highly balanced control is termed homeostasis. As you may imagine, many biological\nhomeostatic systems depend on carefully balanced negative feedback loops (Purves, pp. 699,\n721-723). When the end product of a metabolic pathway accumulates to a high concentration, it\nacts to damp down the earlier steps in the pathway. Conversely, when the end product is present\nat low levels, the earlier steps in the pathway are induced. If designed properly, such a control\nloop can ensure constant levels of the end product. Hundreds of such negative feedback loops\nhave been described in as many biological systems.\n\nHomeostasis of erythropoiesis - keeping the right shade of red\n\nIt is obvious from what was discussed above that the levels of all the various blood cell types\nmust be kept under very careful homeostatic control. We will focus now on only one of these\ncontrol loops - that involving the production of erythrocytes. The process of producing red\nblood cells, as opposed to other of the cell types in the blood, is termed erythropoiesis.\n\nCell Growth and Differentiation\n\n7.012 Fall 2004\n\nWhat biosensors can the bone marrow use to determine whether it has too many or too few\nerythrocytes? In principle, the bone marrow might monitor the viscosity of the blood. Since the\nred cells constitute the great bulk of the cells circulating in the blood, too many red cells might\ncreate a hyper-viscous blood. But in fact, biological systems don't monitor viscosity very well.\n\nA much better parameter to monitor is oxygenation - the extent to which the organs throughout\nthe body are receiving an adequate oxygen supply. Oxygenation is a direct reflection of red cell\nlevels since the red cells are responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the peripheral\ntissues. If the oxygen levels in the tissues are too low, this is a clear sign that more red blood\ncells are required to transport oxygen from the lungs.\n\nSince low oxygen levels affect all peripheral organs, the extent of oxygenation could, in\nprinciple, be gauged at a number of organ sites. In fact, through a quirk of mammalian\nevolution, the kidneys have been assigned the role of monitoring oxygenation of the blood.\nThey have this task in addition to their main job of purifying blood by excreting urine. When\nour kidneys sense low oxygen levels in the blood, they respond by sending a message to the bone\nmarrow to increase red cell production.\n\nErythropoietin (EPO) and very high mountains\n\nThe message sent by the kidneys when low blood oxygen is sensed is the release of a protein\ncalled erythropoietinI (EPO). This growth factor released by kidney cells passes through the\ncirculation from the kidneys into the marrow where it specifically stimulates the red cell\nprecursors. Other branches of the hematopoietic system are not affected by EPO.\n\nThis signaling system has interesting consequences for us. The altitude sickness experienced\nafter rapid movement to high altitudes is due to the fact that our normal red cell levels are not\nconcentrated enough to scavenge sufficient oxygen from mountain air with low oxygen tension.\nSensing inadequate oxygenation, our kidneys produce large amounts of EPO, which in turn\nmobilizes the erythrocyte stem cell precursors residing in the marrow. They respond by\nchurning out astronomical numbers of red cells in several days' time. Soon we feel much better.\nOur blood is now thick with red cells that compensate for the lower oxygen levels of the air\npulled into the lungs. As a result, we are able to oxygenate peripheral tissues effectively once\nagain.\n\nFailing kidneys\n\nHumans with failing kidneys are unable to filter and detoxify their blood effectively. Much of\nthis defect can be cured by kidney dialysis, which eliminates many of the wastes from the blood\nof such patients. But the dialysis does not deal with the fact that these patients rapidly become\nanemic (inadequate levels of red cells). Their anemia is due to the absence of EPO secretion\nfrom their malfunctioning (or absent) kidneys.\n\nOne way of curing this has been by giving these patients blood transfusions. But these are\nexpensive, cumbersome, and with the identification of AIDS and HIV infections, potentially\ndangerous. The alternative is to give these patients exogenous EPO. One biotechnology\ncompany earned more than 109 dollars (US) last year by producing EPO through the\nrecombinant DNA techniques. This recombinant EPO can be injected into the kidney patients,\ncompensating for their own inadequate EPO production.\n\nCell Growth and Differentiation\n\n7.012 Fall 2004\n\nCross-country skiers\n\nEPO, like other growth factors, acts on a specific receptor, in this case a receptor displayed by a\nspecific stem cell in the bone marrow. In response to binding EPO, this receptor induces the\nproliferation of the stem cell and the differentiation of daughter cells into erythrocytes. In\ncertain Scandinavian families, there is a mutation in the gene encoding the EPO receptor. This\nmutation hyperactivates the receptor, much like the mutations that create hyperactive GF\nreceptors identified as oncogene proteins. The hyperactivation in this case is mild and as a\nconsequence, the stem cells of these patients churn out a bit too many red blood cells. This has\nbeen used to explain the fact that individuals from these families have done extremely well in\nOlympic cross-country skiing competitions, since they have hyper-efficient transport systems for\noxygenating their peripheral tissues!\n\nBone marrow transplants and cancer therapy\n\nThe existence of bone marrow stem cells makes other things possible as well. Often during the\ntreatment of cancer, chemotherapeutic drugs or X-rays are used to kill off the cancer cells.\nUnfortunately, these treatments also kill other cells in the body that are rapidly dividing.\nIncluded among these unintended victims are the cells of the bone marrow, the cells lining the\ngut, and the skin cells. The sensitivity of the skin cells explains the temporary loss of hair in\nmany patients receiving anti-cancer therapy.\n\nThese various rapidly dividing organ systems can usually regenerate, given enough time. In the\ncase of gut and the skin, this may lead to temporary discomfort, but the restoration usually\noccurs quite nicely. In the case of bone marrow, the temporary depression of various blood cell\nlevels can be fatal because of anemia and reduced immune defenses. Thus, most\nchemotherapeutics are given in relatively low, sub-optimal doses because the use of higher doses\nmay kill the patient by destroying too much bone marrow.\n\nBone marrow transplantation offers a possible solution to this problem. Bone marrow stem cells\ncan be removed from a patient prior to chemotherapy and stored. Anti-cancer, chemotherapeutic\ndrugs can then be administered at very high (and much more effective) doses. The anti-cancer\ndrugs do their job quickly and are cleared from the body within hours after injection.

      "content": "HUMORAL IMMUNOLOGY\n\nWe are surrounded by a sea of microorganisms that threaten to overwhelm us. This threat is made\ndramatically clear by the condition of AIDS, where the immune system is crippled by a slowly\nprogressive infection extending over a period of years. In an AIDS patient, opportunistic infectious\nagents, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, take advantage of the weakened immune system to invade\nand multiply unhindered. These are not exotic infectious agents rarely encountered in our environment,\nbut rather widely distributed disease-causing agents that a healthy, functional immune system is able to\ncontrol under normal circumstances.\n\nHow does the immune system manage this control? It does so in two ways, as detailed below: via\nhumoral and cellular immunity. Humoral immunity depends on the immune system's ability to\nproduce antibody molecules which bind and inactivate infectious agents. Cellular immunity involves\nthe development of immune cells that are able to recognize, bind, and kill other cells that have\npreviously been infected by foreign infectious agents.\n\nTHE HUMORAL IMMUNE SYSTEM\n\nThe word humoral refers to fluids (Latin - humors) that pass through the body. In this case, the fluids -\nboth blood plasma (the non-cellular fluid portion of blood) and lymph (the plasma-like clear fluid that\nfills the space between cells and drains via lymph ducts to the lymph glands and eventually into the\nvenous circulation) carry specific molecules, which are termed variously antibodies or\nimmunoglobulins. These are the mediators of the humoral immune response. They recognize foreign\ninfectious agents and help the immune system to eliminate them. They are the eyes and the ears of the\nimmune system.\n\nThe nature of antigens and antibodies\n\nAntibody molecules are complex proteins which have the ability to recognize and bind to the surface of\na foreign infectious agent, like a virus or bacterium, and then neutralize it. This binding is specific, in\nthat a given antibody molecule will only bind to one type of virus and not to all others. Moreover, in the\ncase of a virus particle, the antibody will not bind to all parts of a virus, but only to specific chemical\ngroups displayed by the virus which are termed antigens, or more precisely, antigenic determinants.\n\nWhat is the chemical nature of the antigens that are displayed on the surface of a virus particle and\nrecognized by antibody molecules? Almost all antigens are proteins or parts of proteins. An antigen\nmight be composed chemically of an unusual, unique sidechain of sugars that is attached covalently to\nthe coat protein of one virus but not other viruses.\n\nIn reality, however, actual antigens are almost always oligopeptides - short stretches or loops of amino\nacid sequence - which are exposed on the outer surface of viral protein molecules. The specific\nsequence of amino acids that constitute this oligopeptide antigen may be present uniquely on one\nparticular type of virus and not present in any other protein found in a normal, uninfected cell or tissue.\nIf this oligopeptide is indeed unique, then the antigen that it creates will provide a unique signature of\nthe presence of the virus that distinguishes this virus from all other viruses and all other normal\ncomponents of the uninfected cell or organism. Because virus particles are assembled from multiple\ncopies (from sixty up to many hundred) of certain viral proteins, a given oligopeptide antigen may be\ndisplayed dozens or even hundreds of times on the surface of a virus particle.\n\nAll proteins are constructed as amino acid chains far longer than the short amino acid sequence forming\nan oligopeptide antigen. This means that a single protein molecule will be large enough to encompass a\nnumber of distinct oligopeptide subdomains, each one of which can serve as an antigen. Moreover, a\nHumoral Immunology\n\nMIT Biology Department\n7.012: Introductory Biology - Fall 2004\nInstructors: Professor Eric Lander, Professor Robert A. Weinberg, Dr. Claudette Gardel\n\nvirus particle may be assembled from several distinct proteins, each of which has its set of oliogopeptide\nantigens. Imagine, therefore, that a virus is covered with a number of distinct antigenic determinants, A,\nB, C, D, etc. Each of these determinants is composed of a distinct oligopeptide sequence, and each\ndeterminant, as mentioned above, may be displayed multiple times on the surface of a virus particle.\n\nThe immune system can produce a number distinct antibodies, each of which is able to specifically\nrecognize one of these antigens. For example, antibody a may bind specifically to any one of the many\ncopies of the antigen A on the surface of the virus particle; antibody b may bind to any one of the many\ncopies of antigen B on the surface of the virus particle, and so forth. Hence, each antibody molecule\nrecognizes and binds tightly to a specific, complementary antigen displayed on the surface of the\nvirus particle. This very directed and targeted binding of an antibody to its complementary antigen\nrepresents its binding specificity. Some antibody molecules may be less specific, in that they may\nrecognize and bind to an oligopeptide antigen that happens coincidentally to be shared by a number of\notherwise unrelated proteins. (Since the uniqueness of an oligopeptide antigen is dictated by its\nsequence of amino acids, you can imagine that the same amino acid sequence may be present in a\nnumber of otherwise unrelated proteins).\n\nAt any time, there will be many identical copies of antibody molecule a floating around in the\ncirculation. Any one of these may recognize and bind to the A antigens present on the surface of the\nvirus particle, in effect coating the virus particle, and functionally inactivating it- the process of virus\nneutralization. This coating of antibody molecules may prevent the virus particle from adsorbing to the\nsurface of target cells that it might otherwise infect, thereby blocking its infectivity. In addition, the\nantibody-coated virus particle is fair game for certain specialized cells of the immune system (such as\nmacrophages) which can recognize antibody-coated virus particles, gobble them up, and degrade them\n(phagocytize them).\n\nTolerance\n\nThe complexity of foreign antigens that the immune system may experience suggests another difficult\nproblem that it must solve. Our own bodies manufacture tens of thousands of distinct normal cell\nproteins, each of which has its own set of oligopeptides that might be recognized by antibodies produced\nby the immune system. Yet, it is unusual to detect antibodies in the plasma of a normal healthy\nindividual that react with that individual's own normal proteins.\n\nThis means that the components of the immune system that are responsible for manufacturing antibodies\nare somehow able to distinguish foreign proteins and their associated antigens from the normal internal\nproteins that the body itself normally makes. In the language of immunology, the immune system is\nable to distinguish Self from Non-Self. That is, normal cell and tissue proteins are distinguished from\nforeign proteins brought in by an infecting agents such as a virus or a bacterium.\n\nHaving sorted out these two classes of protein antigens, the immune system focuses its energies on\nmaking antibodies that recognize only (or largely) the foreign proteins. In effect, the immune system\ntolerates the body's own complement of normal proteins by not making antibodies against these\nproteins. Such antibodies, if made, might cause the disruption or destruction of our own normal proteins\nand thereby disrupt normal cellular processes. On occasion, however, this specificity breaks down: the\nimmune system inappropriately begins to make antibodies that react with normal cellular proteins -\nresulting in an autoimmune disease that may lead to the destruction of one of the body's tissues by its\nown immune system. For example, early onset diabetes is often due to the destruction by the immune\nsystem of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\n\nHumoral Immunology\n\nAntibody diversity\n\nAs an illustrative example of an infectious agent, we might take the poliovirus particle, which like other\nviruses, displays a series of oligopeptide antigens on its surface. By focusing exclusively on this single\ninfectious agent, we sidestep and overlook one of the major problems in immunology: poliovirus is only\none of many infectious agents that can invade the body. The immune system must be able to mount an\neffective defense against every one of them. How many different infectious, disease-causing agents -\nsometimes called pathogens - does the immune system need to defend us against? How many distinct\nantibodies does it need to make?\n\nIn fact, many hundreds of different pathogens, both viral and bacterial, may enter the body during a\nlifetime. Each of these pathogens may in turn display dozens of distinct antigens on its surface, against\nwhich our immune system will make highly specific antibodies. Thus, during the course of a lifetime\nour immune systems will manufacture many thousands, if not millions of distinct antibody molecules,\neach one of which is reactive specifically with a distinct antigen. How can our immune systems make\nso many distinct antibodies, each having a different reactivity toward a distinct antigen?\n\nThe structure of antibody molecules\n\nTo begin, an antibody molecule is a complex protein, formed as an assembly of several protein chains\n(refer to Purves, Fig. 19.11). Each antibody molecule - sometimes termed an immunoglobulin - has a\nregion dedicated to its antigen-recognizing capabilities. This region, called the variable domain, is\nunique to that particular antibody molecule and is composed of amino acid sequences that are distinctive\nto that antibody. The antibody molecule also has a second region, its constant domain, that is standard\nhardware, shared commonly with all other antibody molecules. The constant domain is formed from\namino acid sequences that create a standard structural scaffolding - a backbone - used by all antibody\nmolecules. The constant domain is not involved in conferring antigen-recognizing specificity. Thus,\nantibody a has the same constant region amino acid sequence as antibodies b, c, d etc. What\ndistinguishes them are their respective variable regions, the amino acid sequences of which are unique to\neach. Each variable region can be thought of as forming an antigen-recognizing pocket (or cavity)\nwhich is capable of binding to a specific antigen. The antigen can be thought of as a key which fits\nspecifically into the antibody lock.\n\nThe problem of generating many distinct antibody genes\n\nThe above discussion provokes a major question that puzzled immunologists for several decades: How\ndo cells of the immune system have enough genes to specify thousands and likely hundreds of thousands\nof distinct protein-encoding sequences? In theory, the information for making all of these antibodies\ncould be encoded in the germline, i.e. in hundreds of thousands of distinct genes, each of which directs\nthe immune system to synthesize a distinct antibody molecule having its own unique variable region.\nBut given the fact that the genome has approximately 30 thousand genes to begin with (the vast majority\nof which are used for functions unrelated to immunity), this hardly seems a likely solution.\n\nThere is a second problem with having the germline carry all the genes made by an organism (e.g. a\nhuman) in its lifetime: How can the germline genome anticipate pathogen that might infect an\nindividual during his or her lifetime. How could hundreds of thousands of distinct coding sequences be\nevolved and encoded in our genome in order to prepare, well in advance, for all future infectious events,\nparticularly when novel pathogens that our ancestors never experienced are continually invading the\nhuman population?\nIn fact, it is now known that only a relatively small number of DNA segments - numbering in the\nhundreds - are responsible for the vast diversity of antibodies. Hence, hundreds of genes are used to\nmake millions, even billions of distinct antibody molecules, each having its own amino acid sequence.\nHumoral Immunology\n\nHow is this possible? The solution is to exploit somatic mutational mechanisms to generate antibody\ndiversity anew, each time a mammal goes through its normal embryonic and post-embryonic\ndevelopment. The germline configuration of antibody genes is tinkered with, rearranged, and combined\nin many different ways to create a myriad novel genes. By randomly mixing these several hundred\nsequences in various combinatorial ways, an immune system is able to generate a vast number of\ndistinct antibody-encoding genes.\n\nUntil now, we have portrayed the human genome as a fixed set of genes that is preserved unaltered\nthroughout one's life unless struck accidentally by damaging mutations. Now we propose a\ndramatically different scenario: the immune system purposely rearranges and mutates a specific subset\nof genes during our lifetime, creating configurations of DNA sequence that did not exist at the moment\nof conception.\n\nBefore the immune system begins to develop, these DNA segments are separated from one another\nalong a specific chromosomal region. (see Purves Figs. 19.20, 19.21) As the immune system develops,\nhowever, these various segments are pasted, cut, and spliced together in various combinations to create a\nvast array of distinct configurations of fused genes, each able to encode a distinct antibody molecule\ncharacterized by a distinct variable region with associated specific antigen-combining properties. By\ncombining a relatively small number of pre-existing, germline sequences in different arrays, the immune\nsystem can make trillions of different, distinctly structured antibody molecules. We will discuss the\nmolecular mechanics of this in more detail below.\n\nThe cells that make antibodies\n\nIn order to understand antibody production, we need to move up from molecules back to cells and\nresolve the following question: What types of cells are responsible for creating this antibody diversity?\nIn fact, the B lymphocytes do much of this rearranging. These cells are the less-differentiated\nprecursors of the plasma cells, which secrete antibody encoded by the now-rearranged genes.\nAntibody-secreting plasma cells manufacture antibodies in their endoplasic reticulum and secrete them\nby exocytosis into the blood plasma. The combined antibody secretion of billions of plasma cells results\nin the diverse array of antibody molecules present in soluble form in our blood plasma.\n\nOnce again, we encounter a puzzle. Does each B cell make hundreds of thousands of distinct antibody\nmolecules, or is each B cell specialized to make only one type of antibody molecule? Here we get a\nclue from the bone marrow cancer called myeloma, which is a malignancy of the B cell lineage. In the\nplasma of myeloma patients, instead of the usual, approximately equal mixture of hundreds of thousands\nof different antibody molecules, one distinct type of antibody molecule will often predominate above\nall others! Thus, this one antibody type (with its own distinctive variable region/antigen recognition\ndomain) may actually represent the majority of the antibody molecules in the blood plasma, rather than\nonly one-hundred-thousandth (or far less) of the complex mixture of distinct antibody molecules in the\nblood plasma.\n\nWhen a tumor develops, all of the cells in the tumor are the lineal descendants of a common, founding\nancestor. These cells represent a cell clone. If each B cell in the blood were specialized to make only\none type of antibody, and one of these became malignant and spawned a large cohort of descendants,\nthen the blood would be filled with these descendants, each secreting the same antibody into the plasma\n-exactly the situation we see in myeloma. Therefore we conclude that each normal B cell is indeed\nspecialized to make only one kind of antibody.\n\nIn a normal individual, his/her B cell population represents a polyclonal mixture of hundreds of\nthousands of different sub-populations, subclones of B cells. Each B cell subclone is composed of\nHumoral Immunology\n\nmany identical cells, all making the identical antibody molecule. In a patient suffering from myeloma,\none of these subclones has expanded so enormously that it now constitutes 10% or even 50% of the total\nB cells in circulation.\n\nDevelopment of an immune response\n\nWe all know that we can acquire immunity against an infecting virus such as poliovirus. This immunity\nmay protect us for years, decades, or often for our entire lives. How is this immunity, which depends on\nthe body's ability to make antibodies that recognize poliovirus, connected with the above scheme which\ndepicts the immune system as consisting of hundreds of thousands of distinct cell clones\n(subpopulations), each specialized to make a specific antibody molecule?\n\nThe first time a virus infects a person, it multiplies relatively unhindered for a day or two until the\nimmune systems begins slowly to produce antibodies to combat it. Only after a protracted struggle does\nthat person's immune system succeed in overwhelming the invading virus through production of\nmassive amounts of antibody molecules that specifically recognize the invading virus. Therefore, the\nimmune system is poorly prepared for the initial onslaught by the virus and its response is delayed by\nseveral days. Only after this delay can the immune system finally generate the antibodies needed to\nrecognize and neutralize the invading virus particles.\n\nA dramatically different outcome is seen the second time that this individual is attacked by this strain of\nvirus. On this occasion, the immune system reacts almost instantaneously with an antibody response\nthat is much quicker and results in the release of a hundred- or a thousand-fold greater concentrations of\nantibody molecules reactive with this virus (see Purves Fig. 19.8). This suggests that the B cells of the\nimmune system have some type of long-term memory of an earlier exposure to a specific antigen (or\nset of antigens), and thus have developed the ability to mount a rapid and intense response to the second\ninfection. This increased, highly potent secondary response creates a state of immunity in an\nindividual. The initial infection immunizes the individual against a secondary infection by creating a\nlarge cohort of B cells that are able to mount a rapid, almost instantaneous response to the virus the\nsecond time this virus tries to attack.\n\nClonal expansion\n\nWe have recognized two major functions of the B cells: different B cell clones make distinct antibody\nmolecules and B cell clones remember exposure to an antigen and mount a response years later that\ncreates long-term immunity.\n\nThe secondary response (the ability to respond to a second attack by the virus years or decades later)\nprovides some clues to how B cells accomplish both functions. The phenomenon of the secondary\nresponse must depend on the fact that in an individual immunized against a specific antigen, the number\nof B cells specialized to make antibody reactive to that antigen is able to persist for long times and is\nnow much larger than when the individual initially experienced the antigen. Thus, one of the\nunderlying mechanisms of immunity depends on the ability of the immune system to vastly expand the\nclone of cells that is able to recognize a particular (viral) antigen after that antigen is introduced into the\nbody. This expansion, which occurs through the multiplication of cells in this clone of B cells, results in\na much larger B cell/plasma cell population and thus increased amounts of antibody. In addition, this\nclone of cells can sit around for years producing this specialized antibody, thereby maintaining the\nconcentration of antibody molecules at a reasonably high level in the blood plasma. These cells can also\nrespond with great rapidity to the secondary challenge by the virus by expanding even further and very\nrapidly.\n\nHumoral Immunology\n\nWe conclude that a foreign antigen can directly stimulate the multiplication of cells capable of\nmaking antibody against such antigen. The case of myeloma is a deregulated exaggeration of this. In\nmyeloma, the clonal expansion of a given B cell clone is driven by its own internal oncogenes rather\nthan by the presence of a foreign antigen that it may recognize.\n\nWe must now postulate a mechanism of antigen-driven clonal expansion. Early in life, we start out\nwith an enormously diverse population of B cell clones, each of equal size, each specialized to make an\nantigen-specific antibody molecule. The number of such clones may be very large - many billions. The\nnumber of these clones may reflect the attempts by the immune system to make as many different\nantibody molecules as is possible, each made by one of these B cell clones.\n\nInto the body comes an invading poliovirus particle, which now stimulates the few cells that have the\npre-existing ability to make anti-poliovirus antibody molecules to start growing. This allows us to\ndeduce another fact: the ability of a specific B cell to make an antibody reactive with a poliovirus\nantigen gives this B cell the special ability to proliferate whenever poliovirus infects the body.\nPoliovirus provokes the multiplication of this B cell selectively. Conversely, poliovirus has no effect on\nthe proliferation of all the other B cell clones that happen to make antibodies reactive against other,\nunrelated (non-poliovirus) antigens.\n\nOnce members of a specialized B cell clone have multiplied, resulting in a general increase in the\npopulation size of that clone (sometimes termed clonal expansion), this clone may remain expanded for\nthe lifetime of the organism, secreting its specialized antibody molecule. Before the poliovirus\ninfection, B cells making antibodies that recognize poliovirus might represent only one-millionth of all\nthe B cells in the body. After a poliovirus infection, one in every 10 or hundred B cells may make anti-\npoliovirus antibodies because these particular cells are representatives of cell clones that have\nundergone enormous clonal expansion in response to a poliovirus challenge.\n\nThis scenario depicts millions, even billions of distinct B cell clones sitting around in the body, awaiting\na stimulus from an infecting viral or bacterial pathogen. What has made each one of these clones so\ndistinct and different from all others? As you can deduce from the above discussion, each of these\nclones has rearranged its antibody genes into a novel configuration. Most rearranged antibody genes\nencode antibody molecules that will prove useless in the life an individual, since such antibody\nmolecules will react with antigens this individual will never encounter in his/her lifetime. But by\nrearranging antibody genes to make a vast array of distinct antibodies, that person's immune system is\nprepared for all eventualities, i.e. all possible foreign antigens that might be encountered in a lifetime.\n\nThe other side of this coin relates to tolerance - the ability of the immune system to recognize normal\nantigens that are indigenous to the body. Although the mechanisms of tolerance are not totally worked\nout, it appears that early in the development of the immune system, a program of clonal deletion\noperates, in which B lymphocyte clones that happen to produce antibodies recognizing normal\nindigenous \"self\" antigens are suppressed or wiped out, leaving behind only those B cell clones that\nhave the capacity to recognize \"non-self\" i.e. foreign antigens.\n\nDetailed structure of antibody molecules\n\nWhat is the structure of the antibody genes that enables them to encode such a diverse array of antibody\nmolecules to begin with? First, let's examine the structure of the most common antibody molecule in\nthe circulation, the immunoglobulin , also called IgG or gamma globulin. It is actually a tetramer of 4\nprotein chains, 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains (Purves, 19.11). The two heavy chains are identical\nto one another, and the 2 light chains are identical to one another. As we discuss in more detail below,\nthe V regions of these proteins chains form the pockets in the antibody molecule that are specialized to\nrecognize and bind antigen.\nHumoral Immunology\n\nThe V region of one heavy chain combines with the V region of one light chain to produce a single\nantigen-binding site. Therefore, together, there are actually 2 antigen-binding sites on a single IgG\nantibody molecule. The heavy chain and the light chain are encoded by two different genes on\ndifferent chromosomes. A given antibody-producing cell therefore makes an antibody molecule by\nexpressing two heavy chains encoded by a heavy chain gene and two light chains encoded by a light\nchain gene and then assembling these four protein chains into a single antibody molecule, which is\nsubsequently secreted by the cell.\nNow let's look at the structure of a heavy chain gene. (Purves Fig. 19.19). The gene is enormous,\nencompassing many hundreds of kilobases of DNA. The DNA of this gene can be divided up into\nhundreds of distinct sub-domains/segments: In humans there are ~300 V (variable) segments, 10 D\n(diversity) segments, and 4 J (joining) segments in this one gene.\n\nIn an early B cell during development of the immune system (and prior to any clonal expansion), each of\nthe early B cell precursors randomly picks one of its many V segments, one of its many D segments, and\none of its J segments and fuses them together end-to-end to create a fused VDJ reading frame that\nconstitutes the variable region of the antibody gene. These particular V, D, and J segments lie on the\nsame chromosomal stretch of DNA; their fusion is achieved by deleting all the DNA sequences that\nhappen to lie between them.\n\nOn the basis of the above numbers, one calculates that there are, combinatorially speaking, 300 x 10 x 4\n= 12,000 distinct V regions possible.\nIn fact, the number is much, much higher. The joining of the V to D to J chains is imprecise - very\nsloppy. Therefore, at the joining points, codons will be created and alternative reading frames\ngenerated. Moreover, the antigen-combining pocket is formed from the V regions of two antibody\nchains, (the heavy and the light chain), each of which contributes half of the structure. Therefore, the\nnumber of possible pockets equals the number of possible V regions generated by variability of the\nheavy chains times the number of possible V regions generated by variability of the light chains -\ntogether creating as many as 10 11 possible combinations! Each one of these combinations may be\nrepresented in a single B lymphocyte -leading to the possible existence of as many as 10 11 distinct\ntypes of B lymphocytes and 10 11 distinct B cell clones in the body. The actual number of B cells in the\nbody may be higher, because each B cell clone, prior to clonal expansion, may contain many, identical B\ncells in it. (However, the number of B cells can't be much higher since there are only about 3 x 10 13\ncells in the body!)\n\nThus, when a poliovirus invades the body, it will stimulate proliferation of those B cells to that, through\nrandom accidents of gene rearrangement, happen to produce antibody molecules that recognize a\npoliovirus antigen. These B cells will now expand clonally and will now be well represented among all\nB cells. Some progeny of the stimulated B cells will become plasma cells secreting large amounts of\nantibodies, some of the progeny will become long-lived memory cells important to lifetime immunity.\n\nHumoral Immunology\n\nSupplementary reading: Additional sources of antibody complexity\n\nThere are two additional dimensions of antibody diversity. First, is the fact many generations of B cells\nare required to fight a viral infection in our bodies. In these dividing cells, there is a DNA region within\nthe variable domain termed the hypervariable region, is subjected to somatic mutation, often point\nmutations that further diversify the V region DNA sequences. Those members of the initially expanded\ncell clone that happen to produce (as a consequence of these random hypervariable somatic mutations)\neven better (i.e. more tightly binding) antibody, are more likely to bind antigen, and therefore more\nlikely to undergo further clonal expansion. With prolonged antigenic stimulation, the subsequent\ngenerations of B cells produce excellent antibody through trial and error due to subtle variations on the\ninitially developed variable region. Thus at the level of biochemistry, the antibody molecules made late\nin an infection bind antigen much more tightly than do antibodies made early in the immune response.\nIn the end, there are not just 1011 distinct V regions (see above), but many orders of magnitude more,\nsince the initial 1011 combinations are then subject to subtle somatic mutations.\n\nEarlier we implied that there is only one constant region and a virtually infinite array of variable\nregions, each forming a distinct antigen-binding pocket. In fact, there is not just one constant region\nDNA sequence, but a series of constant region DNA sequences arrayed along the chromosome\ndownstream of the fused VDJ segment. Initially the VDJ primary RNA transcript splices to the segment\nthat is immediately downstream of it, resulting in an IgM mRNA and IgM protein molecule. Later on,\nthis segment will be deleted from the chromosomal DNA, which now allows an RNA transcript of the\nVDJ region to be spliced directly to a new constant segment, yielding an IgD mRNA and antibody, etc.\nIgM is made early in the immune response, whereas later one often sees various gamma globulins made\nlike IgE, IgA, etc.\n\nThe immune system uses different classes of antibodies to carry out different functions. For example,\none class of antibodies, the IgM class , is used as transmembrane receptors that stud the surface of early\nB cells and are used by these B cells to sense the presence of antigen in the extracellular space. This in\nturn signals the proliferation of the B cell, leading to clonal expansion, and eventually, to class\nswitching, in which the descendants of this cell will now delete their constant segment and use the\nsame variable, antigen-binding segments to form secreted IgG antibody molecules (from their\nconstant region segments). Most circulating antibodies in the mature immune response (following\nrepeated immunizations for example) will be of the IgG class (the so-called gamma globulins). But\nantibodies like IgA and IgE classes will be used in special situations, like secretion into the gut or in the\nteardrops. Thus, a given antigen-binding pocket can be combined with any of 8 constant regions for\ndifferent specialized applications throughout the body.\n\nHumoral Immunology"

      "content": "Viruses\nViruses are important to biologists for several reasons. They are the simplest form of life.\nIndeed they are so simple that they exist on the borderline between the living and the inanimate,\nnon-biological world. Viruses also reveal much about more complex biological entities\nincluding cells because viral replication is governed by the same principles that govern the lives\nof cells. Finally, viruses are responsible for many human diseases including influenza and\nAIDS.\nSome evolutionary biologists argue that all organisms on the planet are simply complex devices\nwhose sole purpose is to make more copies of their own genomes. Viruses take this notion to the\nextreme. They are mostly DNA that happen to be wrapped in a coating (termed a capsid). The\ncapsid affords protection for the viral genes and allows viral genes to gain entrance to\nappropriate host cells. Viruses exist at the border of the living and non-living because they are\nunable to replicate on their own. They are obligate parasites in the sense that they can only\nreplicate after they have invaded and parasitized a host cell.\nBecause viral genomes could be isolated from the genomes of the infected cells, viruses were a\ngood source of pure DNA. This explains why viruses were studied so intensively before the\nadvent of gene cloning. For example, the SV40 virus, a double-stranded DNA virus, carries\napproximately five genes in its genome and the viral DNA molecules were readily separated\nfrom the DNA of the monkey cells infected by this virus. (Recall that the host cell genome\ncarries about thirty thousand genes.)\nThe origins of viruses are even more obscure than the origins of cellular forms of life. Since\nviruses are obligate cellular parasites, we can only assume that they evolved later than cells,\neither as degenerate cells or as renegade cellular genes that learned to manipulate the replication\nmachinery of the cells in which they arose. Viral genomes evolve more rapidly than the\ngenomes of cellular organisms. This rapid genetic change has obscured or erased any\nrelationships that may have existed between various types of viruses and might have been used\nto illuminate their ancient roots.\nThe viruses that parasitize bacterial cells (bacteriophages) and those that parasitize animal cells\n(animal viruses) operate on identical principles, even though the details of their genes and the\norganization of their genomes give no hint of relatedness. We will focus on animal viruses, the\nmechanisms by which they replicate, and the consequences of their replicative strategies on their\ndisease-causing abilities.\nStrategies for Virion Formation\nLike bacteriophages, some animal viruses use DNA while others use RNA molecules to carry\ntheir genetic information. Virus particles, often termed virions are assembled through two\nstrategies. The simplest strategy involves wrapping the viral genome in a protein coat or capsid.\nWithout exception, the capsid proteins are encoded by the viral genome.\nViruses\nMIT Biology Department\n7.012: Introductory Biology - Fall 2004\nInstructors: Professor Eric Lander, Professor Robert A. Weinberg, Dr. Claudette Gardel\n\nA more complex strategy for constructing a virion is used by the majority of animal cell viruses.\nAs above, their genomic DNA or RNA is wrapped in a protein coat. This protein coat:nucleic\nacid complex (sometimes called a nucleocapsid), is then wrapped in a second outer coat, a lipid\nmembrane. The lipid membrane is usually acquired as the viral nucleocapsid exits the host cell.\nAs it is being pushed though the host plasma membrane a patch of this membrane becomes\nwrapped around the nucleocapsid. Hence, the membraneous outer layer of the virion is of host\ncell origin.\nA wide variety of animal cell viruses use this membrane-scavenging strategy for forming their\nvirions. Among these are the influenza virus, encephalitis virus, smallpox virus, rabies virus,\nherpes virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In each case, the membrane\nsurrounding nucleocapsid is studded with an array of virus-encoded proteins. Usually the N-\ntermini of these proteins protrude outward into the fluid outside of the viral particle; the C-\ntermini often contact the nucleocapsid inside the membrane.\nSince lipid bilayers are easily dissolved by detergents, these lipid-containing virions are readily\ninactivated by soaps and detergents while the purely proteinaceous virions are quite resistant to\nsoaps. This explains why most gastrointestinal viruses (including poliovirus) have virions that\nare purely protein. Their virions can resist the strong detergents present in the liver bile that is\nconstantly introduced into the small intestine to aid with digestion. Lipid containing virions are\ninactivated by the bile and cannot infect cells further down in the intestine.\nAll virus capsids, whether purely protein or protein:lipid composites share two traits: they must\nprotect the nucleic acid inside from substances that might destroy the viral genome, and they\nmust facilitate the adsorption (attachment) of the virion to the surface of the host cell. The\ninvasion of a cell by a virus particle always depends upon a specific and tight binding of the\nvirus particle to some surface component of the host cell's plasma membrane.\nViruses have evolved the means to recognize and bind tightly to cell proteins. Invariably, these\ntethering sites on the host cell are normal cell proteins. Each type of virus takes advantage of\ndifferent proteins to gain entry to a specific type of host cell. In the case of purely proteinaceous\ncapsids, the capsid proteins have affinity for one or another of the host cell's surface molecules;\nin the case of lipid-containing virions, the viral proteins extending from the membrane can attach\nto a host cell surface protein.\nThis adsorption must be followed by penetration where the virus succeeds in crossing the plasma\nmembrane and entering the cytoplasm of the host cell. Since the host cell is constantly\ninternalizing its own membrane proteins and recycling them back to the surface, many viruses\nhitch a ride on these host cell proteins to gain entrance into the cell. Other viruses, including\nHIV, have developed the means to fuse themselves to the host cell thereby allowing the\nnucleocapsid direct access to the host cell interior. Once inside, some viruses complete their\nentire replication cycle inside the cytoplasm, yet others may move into the nucleus to replicate.\nViruses\n\nViral Replication Strategies\nThe life cycle of most viruses is designed to maximize the production of progeny virus particles.\nIn the case of many animal viruses, the time elapsed from infection to the generation of the first\nprogeny ranges form several hours to a day. Often, the burden of producing a large number of\nvirus particles causes the infected cell to die. This lysis (literally \"dissolving\") of the host cell is\ncalled the viral lytic cycle, and is an immediate and inevitable consequences of viral\nreproduction.\nOther viruses, in contrast, will refrain from killing the host cell. They can establish a long-term\ninfection of the cell, in which the cell releases a steady stream of viral particles over an extended\nperiod of time. If this continuous production of virus particles does not compromise the health\nof the host cell, it can live on indefinitely devoting some of its resources to making virions.\nIn general, the details of a viral replication cycle are dictated by the type of nucleic acid carried\ninto the host cell by the infecting virion. Most DNA viruses enter the nucleus where they\nparasitize the host cell's DNA replication apparatus. There are exceptions, notably the smallpox\nDNA virus encodes its own DNA replication machinery, and thus remains in the cytoplasm.\nMost RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm because the enzymes used to replicate viral RNA\nare virally encoded. More detail is given below.\nDouble-stranded DNA viruses\nConceptually, the simplest viruses to understand are those with genomes of double-stranded\nDNA (dsDNA). Once the nucleocapsid of this type of virus enters the cell, it proceeds to the\nnucleus where it mimics the genome of the host cell. Usually, the viral genome is replicated\nusing the host cell DNA polymerase, and the viral genome is transcribed by the host cell RNA\npolymerase. The resulting transcripts carrying information encoding viral proteins is then\ntransported to the cytoplasm and seen as a template by the host cell ribosomes. Some of these\nnewly synthesized viral proteins are used as the protein capsid around newly replicated viral\nDNA molecules. These new virions are released from the cell, where they target other host cells\nand trigger new rounds of infection.\nThe dsDNA viruses that exploit the host cell machinery to complete their life cycles can carry\nsmall genomes encoding mostly viral structural proteins, like those for the capsid.\nHowever, the dependence of these viruses on the host cell replication machinery creates a\npotentially awkward situation: the enzymes of DNA replication are generally not expressed in\nquiescent cells (cells in G0). Most of the cells infected will be in G0 and therefore inhospitable\nhosts.\nSome dsDNA viruses, like the herpes virus family or the Epstein-Barr virus (responsible for\nmononucleosis), have large genomes that contain greater than sixty genes. These viruses encode\ntheir own DNA polymerase and thus ensure their ability replicate in quiescent cells. Other\nviruses circumvent this problem by producing a protein that induces the resting host cell to enter\nthe active cell cycle. This ensures that the host cell replication enzymes are available for\nexploitation and reproduction of the virus. This means of producing many virions usually results\nin host cell death.\nViruses\n\nNote however, what may happen if the infected cell is not killed by the virus. The presence of\nthe virus and the viral growth-promoting protein can drive the host cell into unceasing growth\nand cell division. This converts the host cell growth from a normal pattern to a pattern typical of\ncancer cells. The gene that encodes the growth-promoting protein can function as an oncogene\nthat acts to transform the infected cell into a cancer cell.\nMore than 90% of human cervical carcinomas are associated with infection by human papilloma\nvirus (HPV) a dsDNA virus that infects the lining of the cervix. In order for HPV to create a\ntumor, the viral genome must perpetuate itself so when the original infected cell divides into\nmany cells, each new cell contains the virus and the viral growth-promoting protein.\nThe Epstein-Barr dsDNA virus that results in mononucleosis in this country (a non-cancerous\ncondition). For reasons that are unclear, the Epstein-Barr virus triggers Burkitt's lymphoma (a\nchildhood tumor) in central Africa, and a tumor of the nasal cavity in Southeast Asia. These\ntumors are inadvertent by-products of the need to replicate viral DNA. The outgrowth of tumors\nhappens on occasion when virus-infected cells are not eliminated by the completion of the viral\nlytic cycle.\nSingle-stranded DNA viruses\nSome small viruses carry their genome as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. These\nviruses have a simple genome: one gene for a viral nucleocapsid protein and another gene for a\nDNA replication enzyme. The virus with a ssDNA genome also faces a serious replication\nproblem in the host cell. When introduced into cells, these genomes can not be used to make\nviral proteins because the only template for transcription is double-stranded DNA. For this\nreason, the first step after infection is the conversion of the viral ssDNA into dsDNA using host\ncell DNA polymerase. You may recall that DNA polymerase requires a primer for replication.\nIn some of these viruses, the 3' end of the viral DNA folds back and forms dsDNA by base-\npairing with an internal sequence. In this way, the primer is built into the genome and the 3' end\ncan be extended to create dsDNA that serves as a template for transcription. The resulting\ntranscripts are translated to make the viral proteins, the replicated viral DNA is converted back\ninto a ssDNA genome, and the virion is packaged for export. Canine and feline parvo viruses are\nmembers of the ssDNA virus family.\n(+) Single-stranded RNA viruses\n(+) Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses are members of a large family of viruses also called\npicornaviruses because they have small (\"pico\") RNA genomes. The single-stranded RNA\ngenome of the picornaviruses is formally and functionally identical to an mRNA molecules and\nas such is termed \"+\". This viral RNA molecule can be directly translated by the host cell\nribosomes to make viral proteins. Importantly, the host cell does not have a mechanism to\nreplicate RNA (there is no host enzyme that uses RNA as a template for nucleic acid synthesis).\nThus, this genome must encode a viral enzyme that can replicate the ssRNA genome as well as\nthe proteins needed for the capsid.\nIn principle, the viral enzyme could convert ssRNA into dsRNA, but that is not what is seen. As\nthe viral polymerase moves along the (+) stranded RNA template, it elongates a (-) stranded\nRNA molecule that remains single-stranded. No hydrogen bonds are formed between the\nViruses\n\ncomplementary RNA strands. The resulting (-) ssRNA molecules are then used as templates by\nthe viral enzyme for polymerizing new (+) ssRNA molecules destined to serve as the genome in\na progeny virion, or as mRNA for viral proteins.\nMembers of this class of virus include many of the common cold viruses as well as poliovirus.\nCold viruses replicate in the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract. Poliovirus replicates in the\nintestinal lining, but on rare occasions, escapes from the gut and infects the nerve cells in the\nspinal column, resulting in paralysis.\nAfter entering the cell, the ssRNA genome of the poliovirus is released from the nucleocapsid\nand is immediately translated. The genome of poliovirus is carried as a single (+) ssRNA\nmolecule. However, you know of at least two viral proteins required for propagation of this\nvirus. Indeed, poliovirus requires about six proteins, yet it has a single RNA molecule. Does\nthis pose a problem? Translation of the (+) strand of RNA from the poliovirus results in a large\npolyprotein that is then cut into the separate required viral proteins. Interestingly, the protease\nneeded to cut the polyprotein is part of the polyprotein. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem\nfor you to ponder.\n(-) Single-stranded RNA viruses\nBy far largest family of viruses is the (-) ssRNA family of viruses. Their viral RNA genome can\nnot be directly translated, instead the (-) strand is complementary to the viral mRNAs that need\nto be produced and translated into viral proteins. For reasons that are unclear, nature has created\nhundreds of different (-) ssRNA viruses ranging from the measles and influenza viruses to the\nrabies and Ebola viruses. They are all, without exception, lipid-containing viruses. Their highly\npeculiar replicative strategies would suggest a common ancestry, but this is difficult to prove\ngiven the great differences that these modern day viruses now display. We will illustrate this\ntype of virus through the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).\nVSV is a close relative of the rabies virus. It infects horses, cattle and pigs and produces lesions\non the hooves and mouths of infected animals. It can be passed to humans where it reslts in\nfever and lesions in the mouth. After entering a host cell, the VSV (-) strand of RNA faces a\nlogistical problem even greater than that faced by the polio virus. As with the poliovirus, there is\nno host enzyme that uses RNA as a template for nucleic acid synthesis. In addition, this (-)\nstranded RNA is not recognized as a template by the host ribosomes and thus this enzyme can\nnot be directly produced.\nHow does the virus break out of this circular trap? It does so by packaging a viral RNA-\ndependent RNA polymerase along with the (-) ssRNA genome within the nucleocapsid.\nTherefore, once inside the cell, the viral polymerase begins to work on the (-) ssRNA making\ntwo kinds of (+) stranded viral RNA. Some of this (+) stranded RNA is made as short viral\nmRNAs that are then transcribed into viral proteins, some of it is made as full length RNA that is\nthen replicated to make the (-) ssRNA genome that is needed for the progeny virions.\nSome of the (-) ssRNA viruses have segmented genomes. For example, Ebola virus is thought to\nhave three distinct (-) ssRNAs in it genome, each encoding a separate protein. Members of the\ninfluenza family of viruses have eight different (-) ssRNAs. The life cycle of these viruses is as\nViruses\n\ndescribed above, but each viral RNA is replicated separately, and packaging must be regulated to\nensure that each virion receives one of each distinct RNA.\nDouble-stranded RNA viruses\nA small group of viruses carries its genetic information around in the form of double-stranded\nRNA (dsRNA) molecules. These are members of the reovirus class of viruses. Their genomes\nhave ten distinct dsRNAs and virions of this class lack lipid membranes. As discussed above,\nthe virions carry an RNA polymerase that transcribes the dsRNA into (+) ssRNA. These\ntranscripts can serve as mRNA that is then translated into the necessary viral proteins or they can\nact as a template for (-) strand synthesis and be converted back into a dsRNA genome for\npackaging.\n(+) ssRNA retroviruses\nThese viruses are lipid containing viruses whose genomes can act as mRNA. The most\nnotorious of these is HIV, the viruses resulting in AIDS. Aside from HIV, retroviruses are rather\nuncommon in humans, but prevalent in other mammals and birds. The genomes of retroviruses\nare similar in structure and size to picornaviruses like polio virus, and one might suppose that the\nreplicative strategy of a retrovirus resembles that of poliovirus. This is not the case. The life\ncycle of a retrovirus is unique and unusual.\nAfter entering the cell, the (+) strand of RNA is not associated with ribosomes, even though it\nhas all the attributes of mRNA. Instead, the virion RNA is used as a template to make a DNA\ncopy of the viral genome. This copying of RNA into DNA is foreign for the host cell and must\nbe carried out by a viral enzyme that is packaged in virion. The viral enzyme, called reverse\ntranscriptase carries out this process. The terms \"reverse\" and \"retro\" imply a mechanism that is\nthe opposite of that normally operating in all cells. The usual flow of information in a cell is\nfrom DNA to RNA, not from RNA to DNA. The initial product of reverse transcription is an\nRNA:DNA hybrid double helix. The RNA portion of this hybrid is degraded and reverse\ntranscriptase copies the remaining DNA strand into dsDNA.\nThese processes take place in the cytoplasm. Once the viral dsDNA is synthesized, it is\ntransported into the nucleus where it is inserted and covalently linked to the host chromosomal\nDNA. The viral DNA that is integrated into the host genome is called a provirus, and it is\nindistinguishable from the host cell genes. In effect, the retrovirus has created a version of the\nviral genome that has all the attributes of a cellular gene found in the host. The integrated\nprovirus can now be transcribed by the host cell into (+) RNA that is transported to the\ncytoplasm and used either as mRNA in viral protein synthesis, or as the genome for new progeny\nviruses.\nThe Effect of Replication Strategies on Viral Ecology\nWe can define viral ecology as the way that viruses co-exist with their host species. Each type\nof virus has a different relationship with its host, and these relationships are strongly influenced\nby the molecular biology of each type of virus.\nViruses\n\nThe ecology of poliovirus as compared to influenza virus\nThe (+) ssRNA genome of poliovirus, a single long RNA molecule, is unable to recombine with\n(+) ssRNA genomes from other related picornaviruses by the process of crossing-over.\nCrossing-over requires a set of highly specialized enzymes that are not available to the viruses.\nThis means that there are only a very small number of closely related poliovirus strains and\nimmunity against one of these strains confers immunity against the others.\nInfluenza virus presents a dramatically contrasting example. The influenza virus genome is\ncomposed of different RNAs, each carrying different genes. When two different types of flu\nvirus simultaneously infect a single host cell, the two viral genomes may recombine by simply\nexchanging RNAs. A progeny virion released from this cell can have RNAs from each different\ninfecting virus and thus a new, unique strain has been created. This has devastating\nconsequences on human health.\nThe natural reservoir for many flu viruses is the shore bird population around the world, which\nincludes migratory ducks and geese. At least a dozen distinct strains of flu virus live continually\nin these birds. In rural China and other parts of the world, ducks and pigs are kept in close\nproximity with one another and with humans. The ducks become infected with a flu virus\noriginating in the wild shore birds. They can then pass the virus to a pig, which is also readily\ninfected by human flu viruses. In the infected cells of the pig, the two viral genomes can mix\nand RNAs from both viruses can be packaged into one virion. In this way, a new recombinant\nflu virus, one quite different from pre-existing strains may emerge and infect humans.\nThe exposed humans would have not experienced this strain before, and thus there is no\nimmunity to it. The flu virus now spreads throughout the population creating a worldwide\nepidemic (sometimes called a pandemic). These pandemics create serious respiratory infections,\nbut usually prove lethal to only a few, mostly the weak and elderly. This is not always the case,\nhowever. The flu pandemic of 1918 killed 20 million people in Europe in a matter of months\n(more than the casualties of World War I) and perhaps 100 million throughout the world. Many\nof those affected were previously young and healthy. Why some strains of flu virus are benign\nwhile others are lethal is not understood, though it clearly depends upon which viral RNAs are\npresent in the recombinant flu virus. Modern antibiotics, which are highly effective against\nbacterial infections, offer no protection against viral infections.\nThe ecology of retroviruses\nRetroviruses have their own peculiar ecology. Their genomes can become integrated into the\nhost cell chromosome. Once integrated, the viral genome (provirus) may be transcribed, or it\nmay stay dormant and untranscribed. If dormant, the retrovirus can exist undetected for a long\ntime.\nThis has serious implications for HIV infections. The HIV provirus can integrate into the\nchromosome of a host white blood cell (lymphocyte) and remain undetected for years. Only\nwhen that lymphocyte is stimulated by some physiological signal will transcription of the\nprovirus be activated. Suddenly then, virus particles can burst from the cell and infect other\nnearby cells. This dormant state, termed viral latency, means that it is difficult, indeed virtually\nimpossible, to eradicate an HIV infection from the body. There can be many cells that harbor\nsilent proviruses, each is indistinguishable from a normal uninfected cell.\nViruses"

You perform pairwise infections with\neach of your mutant strains and get the following result: (+) = pair of phages lysed bacterium,\n(-) = pair of phages failed to lyse bacterium.\nm1\nm2\nm3\nm4\nm5\nm6\nm7\nm8\nwt\nm1\n-\n+\n+\n-\n-\n+\n+\n+\n+\nm2\n-\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nm3\n-\n+\n+\n-\n-\n-\n+\nm4\n-\n-\n+\n+\n+\n+\nm5\n-\n+\n+\n+\n+\nm6\n-\n-\n-\n+\nm7\n-\n-\n+\nm8\n-\n+\nwt\n+\na) What are the complementation groups and how many genes have you identified?\nb) Can you be sure that you have identified all the genes involved?"
