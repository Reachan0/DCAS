  "course_description": "This course is a survey of perceptual and cognitive aspects of the psychology of music, with special emphasis on underlying neuronal and neurocomputational representations and mechanisms. Basic perceptual dimensions of hearing (pitch, timbre, consonance/roughness, loudness, auditory grouping) form salient qualities, contrasts, patterns and streams that are used in music to convey melody, harmony, rhythm and separate voices. Perceptual, cognitive, and neurophysiological aspects of the temporal dimension of music (rhythm, timing, duration, temporal expectation) are explored. Special topics include comparative, evolutionary, and developmental psychology of music perception, biological vs. cultural influences, Gestaltist vs. associationist vs. schema-based theories, comparison of music and speech perception, parallels between music cognition and language, music and cortical action, and the neural basis of music performance.",

Each student will present a problem and outline their thinking about it, which will form the basis for a class discussion.\n\nTerm project\n\n50% of final grade\n\nA research paper, review paper, or research project (e.g. psychological or physiological experiment, computer model/simulation) related to the psychology of music. Topics will be presented orally and discussed in class in mid-March. Project results will be presented and discussed in class in the last two weeks of class. Target length of paper will depend on nature of project. Final papers will be due on the last day of class. I will be happy to read and give comment on outlines and drafts at any stage of preparation.\n\nGeneral Themes\n\nI group the themes we will cover in terms of Quality and Form, Memory and Anticipation, Codes and Computations, Parallels with Speech and Language, Emotion and Meaning, Psychological Functions, and Origins. We will look at each of these themes in terms of several perspectives: the structure of sound, the perceptual psychology of hearing, our own internal experiences of sound and music, music theory and practice, the neuroscience of the auditory system and the brain at large, computational neuroscience and neural networks, and the psychology of perception, cognition, memory, and emotion.\n\nQuality and Form\ninvolves how we distinguish different musical sounds: pitches, timbres, consonances, musical intervals, chords, melody, and rhythmic patterns. Some of the questions we will address involve how we perceive the basic elements and patterns of music: How do we distinguish pitches? When do sound-objects stand apart or fuse together? What pitches do we hear when a chord is sounded? Why do octaves sound similar? What are the acoustic and perceptual dimensions of timbre? How do we recognize melodies? Why do we perceive transposed melodies as being similar, essentially identical? How are individual events and their rhythmic organization perceived?\n\nMemory and anticipation\ninvolves how we experience sounds in the context of others that came before. Music unfolds over time on several timescales, from subtle differences in expressive timing to note-transitions to melodies and tonal centers to larger, longer structures of repetition and change. This involves memory and anticipation on many levels - echoic memory, working memory, and long term memory. How do tonal and rhythmic expectations arise? What is their neural basis? How are temporal expectations created and violated? How does music exploit them? To what degree are these expectations universal and to what degree are they the result of cultural conditioning?\n\nCodes and computations\nconcerns the neural processes that subserve our experience of music. How does the auditory system represent sounds? How (and why) are pitches at the fundamentals of harmonic complexes heard? What kinds of neural representations and information processing operations are involved? We will examine different neural codes and computations that are based on activation of specific subsets of neurons (channel codes and connectionist networks) and on patterns of spikes (temporal codes and neural time delay/timing networks). How does the nervous system carry out these operations? How much of the structure of music arises directly from the neural codes in the auditory system? How much arises through learned associations and modification of synaptic connections? What kinds of neural net models have been proposed to explain various aspects of musical experience? What kinds are possible? What assumptions underlie high-level, neurological models of music's various psychological functions?\n\nParallels and differences between music, speech, and language\nexplores similarities and differences between music and speech sounds on one hand, and music and language structure on the other. Although the same auditory system subserves both music and speech perception, music and speech typically utilize different sets of acoustic contrasts as primitive features (e.g. tonal music depends on pitch relations, while (nontonal) languages use phonetic elements based on timbral distinctions such as vowel spectra, attack, spectral flux). Can a comprehensive model of auditory tonal quality (timbre) account for the salient distinctions that phonetic systems utilize?\n\nEmotion and pleasure\nare essential parts of musical experience. We create and listen to music for our own pleasure. Why is music pleasurable in the first place? How is tension created and relieved? Why (how) is \"expressive timing\" expressive? Why does music (sometimes) have profound effects on our emotions? What is the neural basis of these effects? What areas of the brain are involved in emotion and meaning in music? How can highly artificial, highly unnatural structurings of sound have meaning for us? Are they tied to mechanisms/habits related to speech perception? Is musical meaning dependent on previous experience and cultural associations, or does it (also) emulate internal body-rhythms associated with our emotions?\n\nPsychological functions\nof music involve the way that music is used by individuals and groups to achieve different ends. Music can be used for mood control, auditory-cognitive interest, meditation and stress reduction, dance, distraction, symbolic ritual, expression of self- and collective identity, evocation of feelings of nostalgia, religious awe, patriotism, anger, hate, joy, love, and sorrow. Different types of music lend themselves to particular psychological functions, and different psychological functions presumably engage different neuronal circuits and processes in the brain. To which uses one puts music may be a function of one's personality and culture. What would a full-blown neurologically-grounded theory of personality and music preference look like?\n\nOrigins\nconcerns how we as a species and as individuals come to be able to deal with the highly complex structure of music. This can arise from evolutionarily-primitive general-purpose mechanisms, recent evolutionary adaptations, and/or associations/connections acquired in development. Is music perception and cognition parasitical on speech reception and language comprehension mechanisms or are there more general faculties for handling temporal patterns, sequences, and associations that support both music and language cognition? What are the similarities and differences between music and language? Is the perception of music a recently evolved capability (and if so, why), or is it based on basic perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that are much more ancient? Do animals apprehend musical structure in some meaningful sense? Do they derive pleasure from it? What dimensions of music perception and cognition would we predict are likely to be shared by other species? How do infants perceive music, how does this change over time?\n\nSince this course is focused on perception and cognition, there are many aspects of the psychology of music that we will deal with only tangentially: e.g. music and personality, music and cultural identity, musical talent and creative genius. If there is sufficient interest in these areas (as well as others), we will organize space to address them.\n\nCalendar\n\nLEC #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nCourse introduction\n\nOverviews: structure of music, music's psychological and social functions\n\nOverview: auditory perception and the time sense\n\nOverview of the auditory system\n\nPitch\n\nPitch mechanisms and neurocomputational models\n\nCentral representation of pitch - problems and prospects\n\nTimbre\n\nConsonance, dissonance, and roughness\n\nScales, tuning and harmony\n\nMelody\n\nHarmony\n\nTonal expectation (guest lecture/demonstration by Elizabeth Chew, MIT)\n\nMusic therapy: clinical applications of the neuropsychology of music (guest lecture by Dr. Kathleen Howland, Boston Conservatory and Wellesley MA Public Schools)\n\nMusic and the cerebral cortex (guest lecture by Dr. Daniel Bendor, MIT)\n\nAbsolute pitch, tone deafness, and cortical representation of music (guest lecture by Psyche Louie, Harvard Medical School)\n\nProblem set due\n\nNeurology of music and music-based therapies (guest lecture by Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, director of Music and Neuroimaging Laborabory at Harvard Medical School)\n\nRhythm, timing, and expectation\n\nEmotion, meaning, expectation and reward\n\nImaging studies of creativity and musical performance (guest lecture by Aaron Berkowitz, Harvard University)\n\nFormal theories of music cognition and language\n\nFundamental problems paper due\n\nDevelopmental psychology of music\n\nGuest lecture by Adena Schachner on beat synchronization in animals\n\nListening assignments writeups due\n\nStudent paper presentations: Janata (2003); Chen and Zatorre (2006)\n\nMusic perception by cochlear implant users (Guest lecture by Ray Goldsworthy, Sensimetrics)\n\nEvolutionary origins\n\nStudent paper presentations: Bhatara on autism, 3 Emotions paper\n\nMusic and speech\n\nStudent final project presentations\n\nMusic and personality, music and multimodal interactions\n\nAudio-visual interactions\n\nWrap up and recapitulation\n\nFinal projects due",

What are the first 10 harmonics of a 200 Hz fundamental (F0)?\n\nB. Which partials can be \"heard out\" or \"resolved\" as individual pitches?\n\nC. What would be the first 10 subharmonics of 200 Hz?\n\nD. What would be the fundamental of 400, 500, 600 and 700 Hz?\n\nE. What are subharmonics 1-10 of 400, 500, 600, and 700 Hz.\n\nF. Which subharmonic(s) do the partials have in common?\n\nG. How is this related to the fundamental frequency?\n\n2. Common harmonics\n\nWe will assume that each note consists of a harmonic complex of harmonics 1-12.\n\nLet the lower note F0 = 200 Hz.\n\nA musical interval of an octave in just tuning is a frequency ratio of 2/1.\n\nA musical interval of a fifth in just tuning is a frequency ratio of 3/2.\n\nA musical interval of a fourth in just tuning is a frequency ratio of 4/3.\n\nA musical interval of a major third in just tuning is a frequency ratio of 5/4.\n\nA. What is the fundamental frequency of a note an octave above 200 Hz?\n\nHow many harmonics do the two notes share?\n\nHow many subharmonics do the two notes share above 30 Hz? What are they?\n\nB. What is the fundamental frequency of a note a fifth above 200 Hz?\n\nHow many harmonics do the two notes share?\n\nHow many subharmonics do the two notes share above 30 Hz? What are they?\n\nC. What is the fundamental frequency of a note a fourth above 200 Hz?\n\nHow many harmonics do the two notes share?\n\nHow many subharmonics do the two notes share above 30 Hz? What are they?\n\nD. What is the fundamental frequency of a note a major third above 200 Hz?\n\nHow many harmonics do the two notes share?\n\nHow many subharmonics do the two notes share above 30 Hz? What are they?\n\nE. Do you see any patterns emerging here?\n\n3. Tuning systems\n\nWe have decided to devise a tuning system in which we divide the octave into 12 logarithmically spaced semitones\n(equally temperament tuning, chromatic scale). There are several ways of doing this. One is to take the twelfth root\nof 2. The first note in the scale is 1, the second note is 21/12 the third 22/12, the fourth 23/12 and so on up to the octave\n212/12= 2. These frequency ratios are multiplied by the frequency of the first note in the scale (the tonic). Frequency\nratios can be expressed in cents. There are 1200 cents to the octave. A semitone is 100 cents, a perfect fifth is 800\ncents, a tritone is 600 cents.\n\nA. If (F0) note A = 440 Hz, what are the frequencies of the other notes in the octave that\nspans 440 to 880 Hz? What are the frequencies in the octave below it?\n\nB. How big is a semitone (one step in the scale) in terms of percent change in frequency?\nWhat percent change in frequency is 50 cents? 25 cents?\nHST.725 Music Perception and Cognition, Spring 2009\nHarvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology\nCourse Director: Dr. Peter Cariani\n\nC. In percentage terms, how much does the equally tempered scale differ from just\nintonation for the fifth (3/2), fourth (4/3)? You can calculate this out or consult the table in\nHandel, p. 331. If the jnd for fundamental frequency is in the neighborhood of 0.2% under the\nbest of conditions, do you expect this difference to be audible? Where is the greatest discrepancy\nbetween intervals based on just intonation and those based on equal temperament?\n\nD. If one were to devise a tuning system that divided the octave into 10 logarithmically\nequal steps, what would the frequencies be for the octave that spans 440-880 Hz? How far would\nthese notes diverge from those of just-intonation? William Sethares in his book Tuning, Timbre,\nand Spectrum discusses such a scale and has written musical compositions based on it.\n\n4. Major aspects of music\nA. Which aspects of music depend (most directly) on perception of pitch? (Two or more\nexamples)\nB. Which aspects of music depend on perception of distinct events?\nC. Which aspects of music depend on memory processes (musical contexts, kinds of\nexpectations)?\n\n5. Pitch and the limits of musical tonality\nA. Roughly, what is the range of pure tone frequencies that we can hear?\nB. What is the range of pitch (f, F0) frequencies for musical tonality (i.e. over which octaves,\nmusical intervals, and melodies can be readily recognized).\nC. What would constitute an explanation (neural or psychological) for why these ranges are\ndifferent?\nD. Provide a possible (neural or psychological) explanation for why we hear the missing\nfundamental. (Paragraph)\nE. What does it mean to say that musical pitch is highly invariant with respect to tone intensity,\nlocation, and duration? What is metamery? What would be an example of pitch metamery?\n\n6. Timbres of musical instruments\nA. What is the main functional role that timbre plays in most western tonal music?\nB. What is the acoustic dimension that distinguishes timbres of stationary sounds?\nC. What are two factors that distinguish timbres of non-stationary (time-varying) sounds?\n\nClasses of instruments: 1. pipe organ (vibrating air column), 2. violin (bowed string), 3. piano\n(struck string), 4. bells (struck, metal), 5. snare drum (struck, membrane)\nD. Which classes produce harmonic tones? inharmonic tones?\nE. Which classes can produce a melody? rhythm?\n\n7. Scales and musical intervals\nA. What is a scale?\nB. What role do scales play in music perception?\nC. What is the tonic? What functional role does the tonic play in perception of melody and\nharmony?\nD. Why do melodies played in different modes have distinctive qualities, despite their use of the\nsame set of notes?\n\n8. Consonance\nA. What defines a musical interval? Does an interval depend on the absolute (F0) frequency of\nits root?\nB. \"Consonance\" is associated with 1) euphony and tonal preference on one hand and 2)\nstability/instability and tension/resolution on the other. Dependence of consonance on musical\ncontext notwithstanding, which isolated intervals (octaves, seconds, fourths, fifths, sevenths) are\nperceived as more consonant? Octaves, fourths, fifths. more dissonant? Seconds, sevenths.\nC. Two rival theories of consonance were proposed by Helmholtz and Stumpf in the 19th\ncentury. What perceptual aspect of tone combinations does each rely on?\nD. Which aspect is thought to be the result of the beating of nearby harmonics? of waveform\nregularity and its consequences for pitch?\n\n9. Harmony and harmonics\nA. What notes and musical intervals constitute a major triad chord (I) in the key of C (major)?\nWhat notes and musical intervals constitute a minor triad chord (I) in the key of C (minor)?\nB. Tonal hierarchy of notes. In the context of Krumhansl's probe-tone studies, we discussed tonal\nhierarchies based on 1) the tonic, 2) notes in I - triad, 3) other notes in the diatonic scale, and 4)\nother notes in the chromatic scale. Which notes would fall into these respective classes for the\nkey of C major?\n\nFor simplicity assume that the tonic (F0) of a just-tuned diatonic scale is 200 Hz and the notes of\nthe scale consist of harmonics 1-6 (consult Handel, p. 331 for just temperament F0 ratios, p. 364\nfor chord notes).\nC. What would be the fundamental frequencies (F0s) of the notes in the major triad (I) if the root\nis 200 Hz?\nD. What harmonics would be present? How many pairs of common harmonics (overlaps) are\nthere?\nE. What would be the fundamentals of the notes in the minor triad (I)? How many harmonic\noverlaps would there be?\n\nIn major keys, chords of scale degrees I, IV, and V have major interval patterns (Major 3rd +\nMinor 3rd), while other scale degrees II, III, VI, VII have minor interval patterns (Minor 3rd +\nMajor 3rd). If chord stability, consonance, and pitch unity were determined solely by the\nproportion of coincident harmonics, would you expect the major or minor triad pattern to be\nmore stable? Why?\nIf chord stability were determined by the strength of the fundamental bass, which in turn were\ndetermined by the number of coincident subharmonics, which pattern would be more stable?\n\n10. Chord progressions\nA. What is a chord progression?\nB. In musical contexts, chord stability is also influenced by its relation to the tonic. If degree of\nrelatedness between a chord (II-VII) and the tonic chord (I) of the key (Krumhansl et al, 1982, Handel,\np. 365) determines the perceptual \"stability\" of that chord, then what pattern of movement would\nbe expected for a I-IV-VII-I progression? Assume that movement from a less stable chord to a\nmore stable one is \"resolution\" (R), while the opposite movement builds \"tension\" (T), e.g., a I-IV-\nII-V-I produces a pattern of movement of T-T-R-R, see Handel, p. 341).\nC. What is key modulation?\nD. Why might perceived relatedness of chords depend on key context? (Handel, p. 373)\n\n11. Melody\nA. What is a melody?\nB. What does it mean to say that melody is invariant under transposition?\nC. What distinguishes a tonal from an atonal melody (see Handel, pp. 355-361)?\nD. Which is more important for melody recognition in tonal contexts: absolute pitch, pitch\ncontour sequences of musical intervals, relations of notes to the tonic?\nE. What are the shortest notes that can support a good melody (ballpark)? the longest notes?\n\n12. Rhythm\nA. Define tempo, accent, beat, meter, and rhythm.\nB. How does rhythm differ from melody? How are these two aspects of music similar? How are\nthey different?\nC. Why is accent important for perception of rhythmic pattern?\nD. If tempo is set at 1 quarter note = 1 beat at 120 bpm, how long in absolute terms is a quarter\nnote? a 16th note?\nE. How do the note durations needed to support a good melody relate to those needed for a good\nrhythm?\n\n13. Organization of voices (auditory scene analysis)\nA. What acoustical factors influence whether two instruments will be perceptually fused (heard\nas one voice)?\nB. What distinguishes a homophonic from a polyphonic piece of music? What musical factors\n(melody, harmony, rhythm) influence whether a musical piece is (perceived as) one or the other?\n\n14. Innate vs. learned mechanisms. In your opinion, which aspects of music perception and\ncognition are likely to depend on bottom-up mechanisms of auditory perception? Which aspects\nare likely to depend on prior auditory experience that is not culture specific? Which are likely to\ndepend on culture-specific auditory experiences, i.e. cultural conditioning?

Which subharmonic(s) do the partials have in common?\n\nG. How is this related to the fundamental frequency?\n\nHST.725 Music Perception and Cognition, Spring 2009\nHarvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology\nCourse Director: Dr. Peter Cariani\n\n2. Common harmonics\n\nWe will assume that each note consists of a harmonic complex of harmonics 1-12.\n\nLet the lower note F0 = 200 Hz.\n\nA musical interval of an octave in just tuning is a frequency ratio of 2/1.\n\nA musical interval of a fifth in just tuning is a frequency ratio of 3/2.\n\nA musical interval of a fourth in just tuning is a frequency ratio of 4/3.\n\nA musical interval of a major third in just tuning is a frequency ratio of 5/4.\n\nFor 200 Hz:\nHarmonics-1: 200 Hz, 2nd: 400 Hz, 3:600 Hz, 4:800 Hz, 5:1000 Hz, 6:1200 Hz, 7: 1400 Hz,\n8:1600 Hz, 9:1800 Hz, 10:2000 Hz, 11: 2200, 12:2400\nSubharmonics-1: 200 Hz, 2:100 Hz, 3: 66.7 Hz, 4: 50 Hz, 5: 40 Hz, 6: 33.3 Hz, 7: 28.6 Hz, 8: 25\nHz, 9: 22.2 Hz, 10: 20 Hz, 11: 18.2 Hz, 12: 16.7 Hz\n\nA. What is the fundamental frequency of a note an octave above 200 Hz?\n2/1*200 Hz=400 Hz (2nd ) harmonic\n\nHow many harmonics do the two notes share? (harmonics 1-12)\n6 (400 Hz, 800 Hz, 1200 Hz, 1600 Hz, 2000 Hz, 2400 Hz)\n\nHow many subharmonics do the two notes share above 30 Hz? What are they?\n\n4 (200 Hz, 100 Hz, 66.7 Hz, 33.3 Hz)\n\nB. What is the fundamental frequency of a note a fifth above 200 Hz?\n3/2*200 Hz=300 Hz (3rd harmonic)\n\nHow many harmonics do the two notes share?\n\nFor 300 Hz-1: 300 Hz, 2: 600 Hz, 3: 900 Hz, 4:1200 Hz, 5:1500 Hz, 6:1800 Hz,\n7:2100 Hz, 8: 2400 Hz, 9: 2700 Hz, 10: 3000 Hz, 11: 3300 Hz, 12: 3600 Hz\n\n4 (600 Hz, 1200 Hz, 1800 Hz, 2400 Hz)\n\nHow many subharmonics do the two notes share above 30 Hz? What are they?\n\n3 (100 Hz, 50 Hz, 33.3 Hz)\n\nC. What is the fundamental frequency of a note a fourth above 200 Hz?\n4/3*200 Hz= 266.7 Hz\n\nHow many harmonics do the two notes share?\n\n3 (800 Hz, 1600 Hz, 2400 Hz)\n\nHow many subharmonics do the two notes share above 30 Hz? What are they?\n\n2 (66.7 Hz, 33.3 Hz)\n\nD. What is the fundamental frequency of a note a major third above 200 Hz?\n5/4*200 Hz=250 Hz\n\nHow many harmonics do the two notes share?\n\n2 (1000 Hz, 2000 Hz)\n\nHow many subharmonics do the two notes share above 30 Hz? What are they?\n\n1 (50 Hz)\n\nE. Do you see any patterns emerging here?\nYes, the number of shared harmonics is the total number of harmonics in a note (12) divided by\nthe number in the numerator of the frequency ratio. For example, the shared harmonics for a note\n\na fifth above is 12/(numerator in frequency ratio)=12/3=4. Likewise, the number of\nsubharmonics shared is 5-(number in the denominator of the frequency ratio) as 5 may symbolize\nhalfway point of the octave. total number thirds (the major unit, as it is the smallest harmonic in\nthis example and the harmonic with the lowest number that is consonant, unlike the 2nd)?\n\n3. Tuning systems\n\nWe have decided to devise a tuning system in which we divide the octave into 12 logarithmically spaced semitones\n(equally temperament tuning, chromatic scale). There are several ways of doing this. One is to take the twelfth root\nof 2. The first note in the scale is 1, the second note is 21/12 the third 22/12, the fourth 23/12 and so on up to the octave\n212/12= 2. These frequency ratios are multiplied by the frequency of the first note in the scale (the tonic). Frequency\nratios can be expressed in cents. There are 1200 cents to the octave. A semitone is 100 cents, a perfect fifth is 800\ncents, a tritone is 600 cents.\n\nA. If (F0) note A = 440 Hz, what are the frequencies of the other notes in the octave that\nspans 440 to 880 Hz? What are the frequencies in the octave below it?\n\nB. How big is a semitone (one step in the scale) in terms of percent change in frequency?\nWhat percent change in frequency is 50 cents? 25 cents?\nEquations:\nA=B*2(n/1200 for finer calculations) where A and B are frequencies of two different notes.\nN=log2 (A/B) approximately equal to N=log10(A/B) where N is the number of cents\n\nA semitone is a half step on the scale (100 cents), so the percent change in frequency is . A/B=\n21/12= 1.047. 1.047-1=.047 or 4.7%.\n\nAlternatively, 100/1200=1/12=.083 or 8.3%.\n\nC. In percentage terms, how much does the equally tempered scale differ from just\nintonation for the fifth (3/2), fourth (4/3)? You can calculate this out or consult the table in\nHandel, p. 331. If the jnd for fundamental frequency is in the neighborhood of 0.2% under the\nbest of conditions, do you expect this difference to be audible? Where is the greatest discrepancy\nbetween intervals based on just intonation and those based on equal temperament?\nFor the fifth, the equally tempered scale has a frequency ratio of 1.498 and corresponds to 700\ncents, versus 1.500 and 702 for the just intonation scale. The equally tempered scale has a lower\nfrequency ratio by .002 and is 2 cents less. No, it is not likely audible as the difference is less\nthan a tenth of the just noticeable difference under the best of conditions. The greatest\ndiscrepancy between the two scales occur at the dissonant intervals: major second D and minor\nseventh A for around 20 cents difference or tritone F# and minor seventh A# with a frequency\nratio difference of 0.018 each.\n\nD. If one were to devise a tuning system that divided the octave into 10 logarithmically\nequal steps, what would the frequencies be for the octave that spans 440-880 Hz? How far would\nthese notes diverge from those of just-intonation? William Sethares in his book Tuning, Timbre,\nand Spectrum discusses such a scale and has written musical compositions based on it.\nThe frequencies would be 44 Hz apart so 484, 528...\n\n4. Major aspects of music\n\nA. Which aspects of music depend (most directly) on perception of pitch? (Two or more\nexamples)\nFrequency and period is dependent on the perception of pitch and are hard to measure otherwise.\nSound pressure of the tone and spectrum or harmonic spacing are other aspects. Rate and place\nof stimulation is affected by pitch, as seen in some cochlear implant studies.\n\nB. Which aspects of music depend on perception of distinct events?\nEchoes serve as an aspect that depends on perception of distinct events. Music depends on\nperception of distinct events when there are dissonant occurrences, like two sources that produce\ndifferent sounds (vocals and bells) or a violinist who does not sync up to the rest of the orchestra.\n\nC. Which aspects of music depend on memory processes (musical contexts, kinds of\nexpectations)?\nExpectations of timing and rhythm may depend on memory processes. Music associated with\ntraditions (such as the wedding march or military fanfares) or widely used musical pieces (like\nthe religious \"Amazing Grace\") can depend on context. For example, the wedding song and\n\"Amazing Grace\" are thought to be slower and more calming than the more bright brass notes of\nthe military wake-up trumpet call).\n\n5. Pitch and the limits of musical tonality\nA. Roughly, what is the range of pure tone frequencies that we can hear?\nWe can hear the frequencies from about 20 to 20,000 Hz.\n\nB. What is the range of pitch (f, F0) frequencies for musical tonality (i.e. over which octaves,\nmusical intervals, and melodies can be readily recognized).\nMost of music occurs within two octaves in the frequency range of 220 to 880 Hz. Components\nof an orchestra (brass, winds, and strings) produce sounds within this range. The range of vocal\nperception a bit larger in the 30 to 5000 Hz.\n\nC. What would constitute an explanation (neural or psychological) for why these ranges are\ndifferent?\nThe range of frequencies we can hear and those that are observed in easily recognized melodies\nare different because we are only able to make meaning of certain patterned sounds, such as\nthose that contain uniform waveforms and expected, 'musically pleasing' note and rhythm\ncombinations. We may hear static or alarm noises at lower or higher frequencies but cannot\nconstruct a meaningful interpretation.\n\nD. Provide a possible (neural or psychological) explanation for why we hear the missing\nfundamental.\nThe phenomenon that Licklider described for hearing the missing fundamental may be the ability\nof the higher cognitive functions to perceive pitch by subtracting frequencies of the harmonic\n(instead of hearing each harmonic separately), resulting in filling in of the missing fundamental\n(a part of the expected harmonic pattern). Neurologically, some theories point to the ability to\ninfer activity from the patterns of the basilar membrane.\n\nE. What does it mean to say that musical pitch is highly invariant with respect to tone intensity,\nlocation, and duration? What is metamery? What would be an example of pitch metamery?\nMusical pitch is not dependent to tone intensity, location, or duration as it is dependent on\nfrequency; a C sharp sounds like a C sharp no matter how intensely it is played on the piano, if it\nis played an octave higher, or if it is held onto longer. An equation confirms this: I=P/A\n(amplitude does not affect frequency, only wavelength and speed of sound).\n\n6. Timbres of musical instruments\nA. What is the main functional role that timbre plays in most western tonal music?\nTimbre gives music texture in tonal music. It is similar to the onset of homophony and\npolyphony after the monophony of chants in Western music, which gave more rich texture with\nmore vocal or instrumental parts.\n\nB. What is the acoustic dimension that distinguishes timbres of stationary sounds?\nStationary sounds do not refer to temporal qualities (timing, such as the envelope qualities of\nattack time and decay) that distinguish between the different sound textures made by instruments\n\nC. What are two factors that distinguish timbres of non-stationary (time-varying) sounds?\nSpectrum and envelope (coloration, tonal character, vibratos, tremolos, etc) are used to perceive\ntimbre\n\nClasses of instruments: 1. pipe organ (vibrating air column), 2. violin (bowed string), 3. piano\n(struck string), 4. bells (struck, metal), 5. snare drum (struck, membrane)\nD. Which classes produce harmonic tones? inharmonic tones?\nHarmonic tones are produced by violins, pianos, and pipe organs. Inharmonic tones can be\ncreated by bells and snare drums.\n\nE. Which classes can produce a melody? rhythm?\nPipe organs, violins and pianos can produce a melody. Bells and snare drums can produce\nrhythms. Bells may also be able to produce rhythm if there is a series of bells with different\npitches (similar to a xylophone).\n\n7. Scales and musical intervals\nA. What is a scale?\nA scale is a series of musical notes in ascending or descending order, usually with the same step\nsize between each note.\n\nB. What role do scales play in music perception?\nScales give a dimension of order in music perception and serve as the basis for how we perceive\npitch. For example intervals and perception in differences between harmonics can be better\nunderstood if one has heard scales played, especially on a piano.\n\nC. What is the tonic? What functional role does the tonic play in perception of melody and\nharmony?\nA tonic is the first note in a musical scale. The musical piece is based on the tonic, and the chord\nincluding the tonic is also usually prevalent; it can be thought of as the 'home key.' Melody and\n\nharmony of the piece may change to different keys and produce different moods, and the tonic\nserves a benchmark for comparison. For example, a symphony may start in C minor and switch\nto E flat major during the exposition or development and conclude in the tonic key of C minor.\n\nD. Why do melodies played in different modes have distinctive qualities, despite their use of the\nsame set of notes?\nMelodies in different modes have distinctive qualities because the pitch relationships between\nthe notes may be somewhat different. Comparing major and minor modes, F in the major mode\nincludes an F# while that of F minor includes the white key. The medieval modes also exemplify\nthis; the fourth interval is augmented in Lydian mode while it is perfect in the other modes, the\nLocrian fifth is diminished while the others are perfect, and there is a mix of major and minor\nintervals (except for the prime and octave) in the different modes.\n\n8. Consonance\nA. What defines a musical interval? Does an interval depend on the absolute (F0) frequency of\nits root?\nA musical interval is defined by the space (number of half steps) between one note and the other\nnote or notes. An interval does not depend on the absolute frequency of the root.\n\nB. \"Consonance\" is associated with 1) euphony and tonal preference on one hand and 2)\nstability/instability and tension/resolution on the other. Dependence of consonance on musical\ncontext notwithstanding, which isolated intervals (octaves, seconds, fourths, fifths, sevenths) are\nperceived as more consonant or dissident?\nOctaves, thirds, fourths, and fifths are interpreted as more consonant, while seconds and sevents\nare interpreted as more dissonant.\n\nC. Two rival theories of consonance were proposed by Helmholtz and Stumpf in the 19th\ncentury. What perceptual aspect of tone combinations does each rely on?\nHelmholtz proposed that the more mismatched the harmonic (the more beats between the notes),\nthe more dissonant the sound, which explains why whole whole tones<perfect fifths<octaves in\nconsonance. On the other hand, Stumpf based his theory of consonance and dissonance on the\nfusion and nonfusion, respectively, of tonal combinations. Helmholtz's theory depends on beats\nwhile Stumpf's relies on fusion.\n\nD. Which aspect is thought to be the result of the beating of nearby harmonics? of waveform\nregularity and its consequences for pitch?\nDissonance is thought to be the result of beating of harmonics nearby. Waveform regularity and\nmore uniform distribution of pitch contribute to consonance.\n\n9. Harmony and harmonics\nA. What notes and musical intervals constitute a major triad chord (I) in the key of C (major)?\nWhat notes and musical intervals constitute a minor triad chord (I) in the key of C (minor)?\nFor a major chord in C major: C, E, and G. C and E, as well as E and G, correspond to a third. C\nand G correspond with the interval of a fifth.\nFor C minor: C, E flat, and G. The intervals are the same as those for C major.\n\nB. Tonal hierarchy of notes. In the context of Krumhansl's probe-tone studies, we discussed tonal\nhierarchies based on 1) the tonic, 2) notes in I - triad, 3) other notes in the diatonic scale, and 4)\nother notes in the chromatic scale. Which notes would fall into these respective classes for the\nkey of C major?\n1) C serves as the tonic note. 2) C,E, and G are in triad I. 3) C D E F G A B are in the diatonic\nscale and 4) C C# D D# E F F# G G# A B flat B.\n\nFor simplicity assume that the tonic (F0) of a just-tuned diatonic scale is 200 Hz and the notes of\nthe scale consist of harmonics 1-6 (consult Handel, p. 331 for just temperament F0 ratios, p. 364\nfor chord notes).\nC. What would be the fundamental frequencies (F0s) of the notes in the major triad (I) if the root\nis 200 Hz?\nIf 200 Hz is the frequency of note C, E is 5/4*200=250 Hz and G is 3/2*200=300 Hz.\n\nD. What harmonics would be present? How many pairs of common harmonics (overlaps) are\nthere?\nThe third and the fifth harmonics would be present. There is a pair of third harmonics (the C to E\nand E to G).\nIf question is asking about the scale, all 6 harmonics would be present and there are 5 2nd\nharmonics, 4 3rds, 3 4ths, 2 5ths and 1 6th.\n\nE. What would be the fundamentals of the notes in the minor triad (I)? How many harmonic\noverlaps would there be?\nThe fundamentals of the notes and the harmonic overlaps would be approximately the same, but\nhaving the E flat instead of the E corresponding to a white key would alter the calculations by a\nhalf step more for the C to E flat 3rd harmonic and half a step less for the E flat to G third.\n\nIn major keys, chords of scale degrees I, IV, and V have major interval patterns (Major 3rd +\nMinor 3rd), while other scale degrees II, III, VI, VII have minor interval patterns (Minor 3rd +\nMajor 3rd). If chord stability, consonance, and pitch unity were determined solely by the\nproportion of coincident harmonics, would you expect the major or minor triad pattern to be\nmore stable? Why?\nI would expect the major triad to be more stable because there is more symmetry in the chord\npatterns (no half step differences between the third harmonics). Also, I, IV, and V have more\nconsonance than the minor scale dcgrees (especially the II and VII).\n\nIf chord stability were determined by the strength of the fundamental bass, which in turn were\ndetermined by the number of coincident subharmonics, which pattern would be more stable?\nIn this case, perhaps the minor triad pattern would be more stable because it may have more\ncoincident subharmonics and therefore a stronger fundamental base and greater stability (unless\nthe shared subharmonics for I and V are greater than those shared between II, III, and VII).\n\n10. Chord progressions\nA. What is a chord progression?\n\nChord progression is a series of chords played according to the order of a scale.\n\nB. In musical contexts, chord stability is also influenced by its relation to the tonic. If degree of\nrelatedness between a chord (II-VII) and the tonic chord (I) of the key (Krumhansl et al, 1982, Handel,\np. 365) determines the perceptual \"stability\" of that chord, then what pattern of movement would\nbe expected for a I-IV-VII-I progression? Assume that movement from a less stable chord to a\nmore stable one is \"resolution\" (R), while the opposite movement builds \"tension\" (T), e.g., a I-IV-\nII-V-I produces a pattern of movement of T-T-R-R, see Handel, p. 341).\nT-T-T-R\n\nC. What is key modulation?\nModulation is the process of changing from one key to another, sometimes the same key an\noctave higher or lower (so key signature does not change though it can in modulation in general).\n\nD. Why might perceived relatedness of chords depend on key context? (Handel, p. 373)\nThere is an element of expectation that the context key engenders; relevant notes and triads to the\nkey context sound consonant while others sound \"jarring\". Spatial differences of chords within\nthe contexts (versus no context) are also important.\n\n11. Melody\nA. What is a melody?\nA melody is a linear combination of musical tones that is thought of as a unified entity.\n\nB. What does it mean to say that melody is invariant under transposition?\nThe melody stays the same no matter what key it is played in.\n\nC. What distinguishes a tonal from an atonal melody (see Handel, pp. 355-361)?\nTonal melodies are perceived to have a single theme because of sequential contours of a melody\n(the amplitude up and down or +/- patterns), size and direction of semitone intervals between\nsuccessive notes, the pattern of scale steps in a tonal framework, and the actual notes played in\nthe melody.\n\nD. Which is more important for melody recognition in tonal contexts: absolute pitch, pitch\ncontour sequences of musical intervals, relations of notes to the tonic?\nRelation of the notes to the tonic is more important for melody recognition in tonal contexts.\n\nE. What are the shortest notes that can support a good melody (ballpark)? the longest notes?\nThe shortest notes are 900 Hz and the longest 200 Hz.\n\n12. Rhythm\nA. Define tempo, accent, beat, meter, and rhythm.\nTempo-speed or pace of a composition\nAccent-an emphasis placed on a certain musical note, played louder and with faster onset\nBeat-a basic time unit used in music\nMeter- a length measurement of stressed and unstressed beats\nRhythm-timing of a series of notes\n\nB. How does rhythm differ from melody? How are these two aspects of music similar? How are\nthey different?\nRhythm focuses on temporal components while melody focuses on pitch relations, though there\nis still an element of rhythm in melody.\n\nC. Why is accent important for perception of rhythmic pattern?\nAccents call attention to certain beats and sometimes changes in rhythm, which may help guide a\nlistener rhythmically. For example, in the beginning of Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\" gives an\naccent every six beats to give a sense of progression of tenseness and conflict.\n\nD. If tempo is set at 1 quarter note = 1 beat at 120 bpm, how long in absolute terms is a quarter\nnote? a 16th note?\nA half note (?) would be 120*2=240 bmp and a 16th note is 120*2*2 (quarterÆeighthÆ\nsixteenth)=480 Hz.\n\nE. How do the note durations needed to support a good melody relate to those needed for a good\nrhythm?\nNote durations can add to the sentiments or mood of a piece. For example, a fermata may give a\nsense of closure to a piece or movement of a piece.\n\n13. Organization of voices (auditory scene analysis)\nA. What acoustical factors influence whether two instruments will be perceptually fused (heard\nas one voice)?\nThe pitch or frequency range and timbre, as well as rhythmic synchronicity and beat patterns,\ninfluence whether instruments are thought of as fused.\n\nB. What distinguishes a homophonic from a polyphonic piece of music? What musical factors\n(melody, harmony, rhythm) influence whether a musical piece is (perceived as) one or the other?\n\nA homophonic voice is centered on one melody and rhythm, even if there are several voices\ncontributing to the harmony (ie an acapella group). A polyphonic piece has greater texture\nbecause the different parts or voices may enter at different times with varying rhythms and\nharmonies.\n\n14. Innate vs. learned mechanisms. In your opinion, which aspects of music perception and\ncognition are likely to depend on bottom-up mechanisms of auditory perception? Which aspects\nare likely to depend on prior auditory experience that is not culture specific? Which are likely to\ndepend on culture-specific auditory experiences, i.e. cultural conditioning? (Short paragraph,\nbriefly give reasoning.)\nBottom-up mechanisms that just rely on sensory inputs may include timbre, as it seems to be\nrecognized very easily and there are no circumstances I know of that can impair somebody's\nability to tell apart the sounds of a waterfall or drum. Rhythm may also be in this category but\nthere are instances where rhythm may appeal to a higher process of expectation. For example,\nParkinson's disease or stroke patients can improve their gait or be roused from their catatonia, in\nthe case of PD. Autistic individuals often respond to the rhythmic components in music therapy.\nThose that are deaf (and thus without the bottom up processes involved in hearing) are likely to\n\nrecognize patterns in metronome ticking or ebbing and flowing of the tide. I believe having\nrelative 'perfect' pitch can be conditioned. The notion of consonance is likely inherent as it is\nimmediately and universally recognized. Some cultures may have more dissonant sounding\nelements, most basic chants still have musicality.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nHST.725 Music Perception and Cognition\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Using\nfactor analysis, van de Geer, Levelt and Plomp found\nthat the responses grouped into three independent\nfactors. The analysis produced three statistically\nsignificant factors. One factor (dubbed pitch)\nincluded the scales high, sharp, tense, narrow, and\nactive. A second factor (dubbed pleasantness)\nincluded the scales euphonious, consonant, and\nbeautiful. A third factor (dubbed fusion) included the\nscales rough, more tones and fusion.\nThe first factor (pitch) was found to correlate\ndirectly with the mean frequency of the pitches used\nin the interval.\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nVand de Geer et al (1962) conclusions (D. Huron)\nVan de Geer et al made the following 3 conclusions:\n1. Musical intervals are judged using three basic dimensions: pitch\nheight, pleasantness, and fusion.\n2. Musicians and non-musicians use the term \"consonant\"\ndifferently. Musicians typically consider unisons, octaves, fifths\nand fourths as the most consonant, whereas non-musicians\ntypically experience thirds and sixths as being more consonant.\n3. Non-musicians conceive of \"consonance\" primarily in terms of\npleasantness.\nNo straightforward relationship between consonance & fusion. [for\nPure tone stimuli! -- pac]\nThe main lesson is that care must be taken when instructing\nlisteners to judge intervals. Some terms are largely synonymous\n(such as euphonious and pleasant), whereas other terms are not\ninterchangeable (such as pleasant and fused).\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nvan de Geer et al\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nVan de Geer et al 1962\ndata replotted pac 2007\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nConsonance perception: theories\nCultural conditioning\nSmall Is beautiful, simple\n-\nsmall integer ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4)\n- simpler, smoother waveforms\n-\nless complex interspike interval patterns\nRoughness: interactions of nearby tones in filters\n(Helmholtz, cochlear & neural filtering)\nFusion of tones\n- consonance related to number of competing\npitches, unity of perception (Stumpf)\nDual theories: Terhardt, Helmholtz: sensory\n(peripheral beating) & cognitive (expectations,\ncontext); sensory vs. musical consonance\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nRoughness isnʼt all there is to consonance.....\nRoughness (Helmholtz)\nPitch fusion/tonal fusion (Stumpf)\nNumber of voices (\"chorus effect\", Huron)*\nShrillness (high frequency partials, Huron)\nPresence of noise (conjecture)\nhttp://www.harmony-central.com/Effects/Articles/Chorus/\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nHarmonic complex w. upper harmonics\nRoughness isnʼt all there is to consonance.....\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nNeural basis of consonance\nIn the 1990ʼs we (Mark Tramo, Peter Cariani,\nand Bertrand Delgutte did an extensive neuro\nphysiological study of the neural basis of\nconsonance in the cat auditory nerve.\nWe found neural correlates both\nfor roughness and pitch fusion.\nThese neural correlates both match up with\nhuman listener judgments quite well.\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nMark Tramoʼs stimulus set\nFriday, March 13, 2009\nCourtesy of Prof. Mark J.

The circle of fifths\nmakes up many of the most commonly used progressions, such\nas II6, V, I in major.\"\n-- Wikipedia\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nCommon progressions used in\ncontemporary popular music\nwelve-bar blues・I - vi - IV - Vハ:\ne 50s progression・I - V - vi - IVハ:\nr example 'Dammit' (Blink-182), 'With or\nithout You' (U2), 'Let It Be' (The Beatles).\nhis progression uses the same chords as the\n・T\nth\nfo\nW\nT\n\n50s progression, in a different order.\n・I - I - IV - Vハ: for example the verse of 'Good\nRiddance (Time of Your Life' by Green Day.\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nThree chord song\n\"A three-chord song is a song whose music is built around three chords that are\nplayed in a certain sequence. Perhaps the most prevalent type of three-chord\nsong is the simple twelve bar blues used in blues and rock and roll.\nTypically, the three chords used are the chords on the tonic, subdominant, and\ndominant (scale degrees I, IV and V): in the key of C, these would be the C, F\nand G chords. Sometimes the V7 chord is used instead of V, for greater tension.\nThree-chord songs are easy for the listener to remember, which can make them\neffective in pop music. Some of the most famous songs to use three-chord\npatterns are \"Louie Louie\" by The Kingsmen and \"Wild Thing\" by The Troggs.\nThree-chord songs like these are also easier to learn than other, more\ncomplicated songs. Among others, country singer Hank Williams and folk singer\nBob Dylan have written large numbers of such songs. Denis Leary's song\n\"Asshole\" uses a three chord progression. Punk music very often features three-\nchord songs - sometimes called a 'three chord trash' (cf. The Ramones).\"\n-- Wikipedia.\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nCommon progressions used\nin the common practice period (roughly 1600-1900)\nI, i May progress to any other triad.

This\nmay or may not be accompanied by a change in key signature.\nModulations articulate or create the structure or form of many\npieces, as well as add interest.\nThere are several different types of modulation -- (these) modulations may be\nprepared or unprepared, smooth or abrupt. It is smoother to modulate to more\nclosely related keys than to keys further away. Closeness is determined by the\nnumber of notes in common between keys, which provides more possible pivot\nchords, and their closeness on the circle of fifths. A modulation is often\ncompleted by a cadence in the new key, which helps to establish it.

The fundamental is often denoted by F0.\nThe fundamental frequency is therefore the greatest common divisor of all\nthe frequencies of the partials.\nHarmonics above the fundamental constitute the overtone series.\nSubharmonics are integer divisions of the fundamental:\ne.g. for F0= 100 Hz, subharmonics are at 50, 33, 25, 20, 16.6 Hz etc.\nSubharmonics are also called\nundertones.\nThe fundamental period is 1/F0, e.g. for F0=100 Hz, it is 1/100 sec or 10\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nPeriodic sounds: time and frequency domains\nWaveforms\nPower Spectra\nAutocorrelations\nFormant-related\nPitch periods, 1/F0\nVowel quality\n125 Hz\n100 Hz\nTimbre\n[ae]\nF0 = 100 Hz\n[ae]\nF0 = 125 Hz\n[er]\nF0 = 100 Hz\n[er]\nF0 = 125 Hz\n0 1\nTime (ms)\nFrequency (kHz)\nInterval (ms)\nFriday, March 13, 2009\n\nPitch : basic properties to be explained\n- Highly precise percepts\n- Musical half step: 6% change F0\n- Minimum JND's: 0.2% at 1 kHz (20 usec time difference, comparable to ITD jnd)\n- Highly robust percepts\n- Robust quality Salience is maintained at high stimulus intensities\n- Level invariant (pitch shifts < few % over 40 dB range)\n- Phase invariant (largely independent of phase spectrum, f < 2 kHz)\n- Strong perceptual equivalence classes\n- Octave similarities are universally shared\n- Musical tonality (octaves, intervals, melodies) 30 Hz - 4 kHz\n- Perceptual organization (\"scene analysis\")\n- Fusion: Common F0 is a powerful factor for grouping of frequency components\n- Two mechanisms?

Excitation pattern Using the filter shapes and bandwidths derived from masking experiments we can\nproduce the excitation pattern produced by a sound. The excitation pattern shows how much energy comes\nthrough each filter in a bank of auditory filters. It is analogous to the pattern of vibration on the basilar\nmembrane. For a 1000 Hz pure tone the excitation pattern for a normal and for a SNHL (sensori-neural\nhearing loss) listener look like this: The excitation pattern to a complex tone is simply the sum of the\npatterns to the sine waves that make up the complex tone (since the model is a linear one). We can hear out\na tone at a particular frequency in a mixture if there is a clear peak in the excitation pattern at that\nfrequency. Since people suffering from SNHL have broader auditory filters their excitation patterns do not\nhave such clear peaks. Sounds mask each other more, and so they have difficulty hearing sounds (such as\nspeech) in noise. --Chris Darwin, U.

Induced GBA may reflect temporally precise ex\npectancies for strongly and weakly accented events in\nsound patterns. Moreover, induced GBA behaves in a\nmanner consistent with perception-action coordination\nstudies using perturbed temporal sequences. Taken\ntogether, the characteristics of induced GBA provide\nevidence for an active, dynamic system capable of\nmaking predictions (i.e., anticipation), encoding metri\ncal patterns and recovering from unexpected stimuli.\nGBA appears to be a useful neuroelectric correlate\nof rhythmic expectation and may therefore reflect pulse\nperception. Due to the anticipatory nature of GBA, it\nmay be supposed there is an attentional dependence.\nFuture research should aim to manipulate attentional\nstate, localize neural sources and further probe the\nrole of induced GBA in meter perception.\nThursday, May 14, 2009\nCourtesy of University of Finance and Management, Warsaw.

Equal temperament became\nthe standard gradually during the Romantic era.\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nDesigning a scale system - 12 equally tempered notes/oct.\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nProblems that tuning creates and solves.... (Wikipedia, Musical temperament)\n\"Just intonation has the problem that it cannot modulate to a different key (a very\ncommon means of expression throughout the Common practice period of music)\nwithout discarding many of the tones used in the previous key, thus for every key\nthe musician wishes to modulate to, the instrument must provide a few more\nstrings, frets, or holes for him or her to use. When building an instrument, this can\nbe very impractical.\nWell temperament is the name given to a variety of different systems of\ntemperament that were employed to solve this problem, in which some keys are\nmore in tune than others, but all can be used. This phenomenon gives rise to\ninfinite shades of key-colors, which are lost in the modern standard version: 12\ntone equal temperament (12-TET). Unlike Meantone temperament, which alters\nthe fifth to temper out the Syntonic comma, 12-TET tempers out the Pythagorean\ncomma, thus creating a cycle of fifths that repeats itself exactly after 12 steps.\nThis allowed the intervals of Tertian harmony, thirds and fifths, to be fairly close to\ntheir just counterparts (the fifths almost imperceptibly beating, the thirds a little\nmilder than the Syntonic beating of Pythagorean tuning), while permitting the\nfreedom to modulate to any key and by various means (e.g. common-tone and\nenharmonic modulation, see modulation). This freedom of modulation also\nallowed substantial use of more distant harmonic relationships, such as the\nNeapolitan chord, which became very important to Romantic composers in the\n19th century.\"\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nC-Major diatonic scale\nThursday, May 14, 2009\nD\ni\na\ng\nr\na\nm\nof one octave, C-C, of a piano keyboard.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\ndiatonic\nscale\nThursday, May 14, 2009\nD\ni\na\ng\nr\na\nm\nof one octave, C-C, of a piano keyboard.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nDiatonic scale\n\"In Music theory, the diatonic major scale is a fundamental building block of the\nWestern musical tradition. The diatonic scale is composed of two tetrachords\nseparated by intervals of a whole tone. The pattern of intervals in semitones is as\nfollows 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. The major scale begins on the first note and proceeds by\nsteps to the first octave. In solfege, the syllables for each scale degree are \"Do-Re-\nMi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti-Do\". The natural minor scale can be thought of in two ways, the first\nis as the relative minor of the major scale, beginning on the sixth degree of the scale\nand proceeding step by step through the same tetrachords to the first octave of the\nsixth degree. In solfege \"La-Ti-Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol.\" Alternately, the natural minor can\nbe seen as a composite of two different tetrachords of the pattern 2-1-2-2-1-2-2. In\nsolfege \"Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti-Do.\" All of non-folk Western harmony from the some\npoint in the late Renaissance up to the late nineteenth century is based upon these\ntwo objects and the unique relationships created by this system of organizing 7\nnotes. It should be kept in mind that most pieces of music change key, and thus\nscale, but are still related to the beginning diatonic scale. The white keys on a piano\ncorrespond to the diatonic scale of C major (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C), with the notes a\nwhole tone apart, except for E-F and B-C, which is an interval of a semitone (half a\ntone). Diatonic comes from the greek \"diatonikos\" or \"to stretch out\". It is\nsometimes used to refer to all the modes, but is generally used only in reference to\nthe major and minor scales.\"\n-- Wikipedia\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nThree tuning systems\nCourtesy of MIT Press.

I became\ncurious about modes when I learned that \"Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" and \"Scarborough Fair\" use the old balladic scale\nwhich matches the church \"Dorian Mode\" (C-D-D#-F-G-A-A#-C). I used the eerie church \"Mixolydian mode\" (C-D-E-F-G-A-A#-C) for\nmy intranet version of \"The Pathology Blues\", on our quizbank. You can also hear the church \"Mixolydian mode\" in \"The Beat Goes\nOn\", \"Luck Be a Lady Tonight\", \"Norwegian Wood\", \"Day Tripper\", \"Sundown\" (Gordon Lightfoot), \"Cats in the Cradle\", \"City of New\nOrleans\" (verse but not chorus), and the theme to \"Star Wars\".\nCaedmon recordings used it for the tune for the mystical first song\nin Yeats's play \"The Only Jealousy of Emer\". The other church modes are novelties at best. Some of the old Gregorian chant \"Sing\nmy tongue...\" seems to be Phrygian mode. There is some of the church \"Phrygian mode\" in \"Fiddler on the Roof\", and if the song is\nfully transposed into the church Phygian mode, it still sounds okay. My own attempt to write a song using the church Phrygian mode\nwas dismal. I wrote a little song in an unabashed church \"Lydian mode\". The mode itself suggested the subject. Unless you only use\nthe subdominant as a leading tone for the dominant, any melody you write in this \"mode\" will be unnerving -- the subdominant is\nequidistant from the lower and upper tonics. A correspondent pointed out that the \"Lydian\" mode makes up some of the \"Jetsons\"\nand \"Simpsons\" theme. Bartok wrote a short piece in the Lydian mode .In the Locrian mode, the dead-center position of the dominant\nmakes this even more unmusical. A music professional told me once that no ethnomusicologist has ever documented a folk tune in\nwhat medieval theorists called the \"Locrian mode\". I browsed a little in Plato, Aristotle, pseudo-Plutarch's \"De Musica\", and of course\nthe Oxford History of Music,\nand came away wondering if the medieval music theorists (Boethius, Gregory the Great, their\nsuccessors) really meant the same thing as did the Greeks who named the modes. Today most people (following a scholar named\nWestphal)\ntell us that the Greek modes were indeed used as \"scales\" with the tonic notes being the low-pitched one, just as the\nchurch mode theorists say. This seems to be based on statements in Plato and Aristotle that the modes had distinct emotive\nqualities, as our major and minor scales do. Another school of thought (that of Munro) claims that for the ancients, the modes were\nactually keys, i.e., you could play any melody in any mode. If this is true, then the ancient Greeks had either perfect pitch or a\nstandard pitchpipe. I think people have probably liked similar tunes in different eras. I tried to figure out how the ancient Greeks\nwould have played some of our favorites. Ancient Greek lyres typically had seven strings. (Some Hebrew lyres must have had ten\nstrings -- see Psalm 33.) The system of modes is also called \"harmoniae\", which meant \"fitting\" or \"tuning\". Greek writers on music\ntalk about the normal tuning comprising two tetrachords, i.e., a series of four notes with the lowest and highest separated by a major\nfourth and sharing the center string. Pythagoras and Terpander are both credited with the idea of having the highest string be an\noctave of the lowest string.\nhttp://www.pathguy.com/modes.htm\nCourtesy of Ed Friedlander.\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nScala (Program for calculating scales)\nScala is a freeware software application for experimenting with musical tunings.\nSee http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/\nThursday, May 14, 2009\n\nModes\nWhat are Modes of a Scale?\n\"A modal melody is one that is not in a \"key\" of the major or mi\nsort common in music of the Western world in the past 300 to 4\nyears.\nInstead, its scale may be comprised of almost any set\ntones, not only those that imply 3-part harmony.

At first\nglance, this is counter-intuitive, since the orchestra is\nperceived by us to be so much louder than a single singer.\nThe answer to this mystery lies in the way the sound energy\nof the operatic voice is distributed across various frequencies.\nhttp://www.ncvs.org/ncvs/tutorials/voiceprod/tutorial/singer.html\nFriday, March 13, 2009\nText and images removed due to copyright restrictions.\nSee http://www.ncvs.org/ncvs/tutorials/voiceprod/tutorial/singer.html.\n\nVocal Ring, or The Singer's Formant\nFriday, March 13, 2009\nText and images removed due to copyright restrictions.\nSee http://www.ncvs.org/ncvs/tutorials/voiceprod/tutorial/singer.html.\n\nSinger's\nformant\nCook, Perry, ed.\nMusic, Cognition &\nComputerized Sound\nMIT Press 2001\nFriday, March 13, 2009\nCourtesy of MIT Press.

Excitation pattern. Using the filter shapes and bandwidths derived from masking experiments we can\nproduce the excitation pattern produced by a sound. The excitation pattern shows how much energy comes\nthrough each filter in a bank of auditory filters. It is analogous to the pattern of vibration on the basilar\nmembrane. For a 1000 Hz pure tone the excitation pattern for a normal and for a SNHL (sensori-neural\nhearing loss) listener look like this: The excitation pattern to a complex tone is simply the sum of the\npatterns to the sine waves that make up the complex tone (since the model is a linear one). We can hear out\na tone at a particular frequency in a mixture if there is a clear peak in the excitation pattern at that\nfrequency. Since people suffering from SNHL have broader auditory filters their excitation patterns do not\nhave such clear peaks. Sounds mask each other more, and so they have difficulty hearing sounds (such as\nspeech) in noise. --Chris Darwin, U.

Whereas the DIFFERENTIAL\nTHRESHOLD is the just noticeable difference (jnd) of a single frequency, the critical\nbandwidth represents the ear's resolving power for simultaneous tones or partials.\nIn a COMPLEX TONE, the critical bandwidth corresponds to the smallest frequency\ndifference between two PARTIALs such that each can still be heard separately\n. It may\nalso be measured by taking a SINE TONE barely MASKed by a band of WHITE NOISE\naround it; when the noise band is narrowed until the point where the sine tone\nbecomes audible, its width at that point is the critical bandwidth. See: RESIDUE\n.\nIn terms of length (see diagram under BASILAR MEMBRANE) the critical bandwidth is nearly\nconstant at 1.2 mm, within which are located about 1300 receptor cells, and is\ngenerally independent of intensity (unlike COMBINATION TONES). Twenty-four critical\nbands of about one-third octave each comprise the audible spectrum.\nTuesday, February 10, 2009\nTruax, B., ed. From \"CRITICAL BAND and CRITICAL BANDWIDTH.\" http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/handbook/Critical_Band.html\nHandbook for Acoustic Ecology. 2nd edition, 1999. Courtesy of Barry Truax. Used with permission.\n\nCritical bands (usually interpreted in terms of frequency analysis)\nSimultaneous tones lying within a critical bandwidth do not give any increase in\nperceived loudness over that of the single tone, provided the sound pressure level\nremains constant. For tones lying more than a critical bandwidth apart, their\ncombination results in increased loudness.\nWhen two tones are close together in frequency, BEATS occur, and the resulting\ntone is a fusion of the two frequencies. As the frequency difference increases,\nroughness in the tones appears, indicating that both frequencies are activating the\nsame part of the basilar membrane. Further apart, the two frequencies can be\ndiscriminated separately, as shown below by DfD, whereas roughness only\ndisappears at a frequency separation equal to the critical bandwidth DfCB. At this\npoint, the two frequencies activate different sections of the basilar membrane. This\nphenomenon only applies to monaural listening with pure tones. With DICHOTIC\nlistening, the basilar membrane of each ear is activated separately, and therefore no\nroughness results. With complex tones, frequency discrimination is improved but the\ncritical bandwidth remains the same for each of the component partials.\nAlternative interpretation is that critical bandwidths are the result of fusion of\n(e.g. interspike interval) representations rather than cochlear proximity per se.\nTuesday, February 10, 2009\nTruax, B., ed.
