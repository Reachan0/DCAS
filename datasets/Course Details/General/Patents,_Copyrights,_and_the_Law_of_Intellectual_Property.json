The course also focuses on copyrights, provides a brief look at trademarks and trade secrets, presents comparisons of what can and cannot be protected, and what rights the owner does and does not obtain. Issues relating to information technology, biogenetic materials, and business methods are highlighted.\n\nMost of the assigned readings are case decisions and excerpts from federal statutes. Class sessions combine discussion with lecture, and students are expected to read the assigned material carefully prior to each class.\n\nCourse Requirements and Grading\n\nThere will be one mid-term exam and one second-half-term exam. There will also be a short patent-search project, with a written report and optional class presentation. In addition, there will be very short exercises based on the readings throughout the term.

Though it may not be entirely\nsuited in all respects to our current problems and needs, and though sometimes\nit may have been misused, its record of achievement in the progress of our\ncountry is indelibly written on the pages of history. Its current service, despite\nthe fact that it is not being fully utilized in the second half of the century, seems\nto me equally indisputable; though some critics without firsthand experience in\nthis field may not agree. Those critics are free to write their own books.\nI have undertaken to write mine as a champion of the philosophy that today,\nas much as ever, incentives that make a person fight to be an individual promote\nthe welfare the whole state. In my lectures, many of which have been included\nin this book, I frankly paint a picture, particularly for engineers and applied\nscientists, that is based on this philosophy and thus supports patents1\nBut invention, patents, and innovation cannot be treated apart from their\nsocial, political, and economic environment, despite mechanistic courses given\nin law schools. Thus, to review the principles of patent law without delving into\nthe interplay of many aspects of our society would be to discuss a theoretical,\nnonexistent system. This book, therefore, is not addressed solely to engineers\nand applied scientists; some parts are addressed to lawyers, economists, busi\nnessmen, and politicians.\nI have found the problem of presenting all facets so that they may be under\nstood by readers of quite varied disciplines to be not without difficulty. For this\nreason illustrations have been confined to technology that can readily be com\nprehended by nontechnicians, and legal and economic discussions have been kept\nsufficiently elementary to be grasped at least in part by the technical reader,\nbut without sacrificing the point intended for the legalist or economist.\nThose who expect an engineering \"cookbook\" approach to this subject will\nnot find it here. Similarly, those who look for a presentation in the form of a\nProcrustean \"case study\" will be equally disappointed.\nTo write an interdisciplinary book requires a mixture of interdisciplinary\ntechniques, and so I have tried to interweave history, primary principles, proce\ndures, problems, and points of conflict into what I believe to be the true fabric\npattern of the patent system, struggling to stay alive in a world of rapid change.\nBecause of this somewhat unorthodox approach, I have summarized the scope\n1Gordon McKay Lectures on Patent Law, given at Harvard University, 1956-58.\n\nCreate or Perish\nof each chapter at its head, and, in some cases, the reason for the approach used\nin order that the reader may better understand my mode or presentation.\nIn Chapter 1, a survey of the origin and historical background of the Amer\nican patent system is presented; and, at its conclusion, serious questions are\nraised as to whether that system is currently either effectively performing its\noriginal historical purposes or meeting the requirements of the present. I hope\nthat by the end of the book, the reader may have gained an insight into some\nof the answers to these questions.\nChapter 2 reviews the role of the Patent Office and the courts in adminis\ntration of the patent laws, especially for the benefit of those unfamiliar with the\nadministrative details of patent application prosecution and judicial review.\nThe statutory provisions of American patent law are discussed in Chapter\n3, with reference to actual cases interpreted and decided by the courts. While\nthe classes of patentable inventions and the conditions of patentability can be\nreadily agreed upon, there is widespread conflict as to the standard set by the\n1952 Patent Act to determine what is \"invention\" and what is \"obvious.\" I\nhave, accordingly, devoted a section of this chapter to discussing this conflict,\ngiving my own views - predicated upon what I feel is in the national interest,\nnamely an interpretation that encourages the independent American inventor\nand his backers as well as corporate inventors. In this connection the chapter\nconcludes with statistics offered by leading independent inventors pointing up\ntheir vital current contributions to technology and the necessity for liberal and\nsympathetic legal recognition of their work if the independent inventor is not to\ndisappear from the American scene.\nIn Chapter 4, I have carried forward an illustrative approach found most\neffective in lecturing: tying together the complete picture of innovation - from\nthe conception and invention stage, through financial backing and development,\nentrepreneuring, business formation, and legal contests with pirates. Here I have\nused the medium of the Bell Telephone Cases, because this outdated invention\ninvolves technology and a degree of importance familiar to all readers, and\nbecause almost everything that could happen did happen to Bell, except the\nanonymity experienced by many current inventors from which he was saved by\na single vote in the Supreme Court.\nStrongly woven through the fabric of the invention-innovation cycle are the\nrelations between inventor and employer and between inventor and potential\nuser or licensee. These include typical industrial, university, and governmental\ncontract provisions. Since inventions are frequently stolen, the pitfalls facing\nthe inventor are reviewed in Chapter 5. There are, however, very few proven\ncases of such piracy, and so I have selected a previously little-known example\n(in the field of piezoelectricity) that took over two decades to document and\nestablish by legal decision. The publication of this exposure, it is hoped, may\nforewarn the inventor, and perhaps give second thoughts to business and govern\nmental agencies in the matter of trying to circumvent the proprietary position\nof inventors.\nChapter 6 discusses critically recent proposals for improving the patent sys\ntem, including current conflicting views in Congress and the courts as to gov\n\nIntroduction\nernment rights in patents and other matters.\nI have left to Chapter 7 a consideration of the exciting modernization pro\ngram being planned by the European Economic Community with the view of\nproviding a single common European patent and law of patents. The possible\neffect of this upon the American system is noted, and some of my own views\nwith regard to possible immediate improvements in the administration of our\nsystem are presented.\nThough one of expected primary groups of readers of this book is the en\ngineering profession, the solution to current problems in the protection of in\nventions and patents calls for more than mere engineering consideration. There\nis a decided, and even primary, legal side concerning which something must be\nsaid. In Chapter 8, therefore, I have supplemented Chapter 7's technical sug\ngestions for Patent Office and administrative improvement with proposals for\nmodernizing judicial review. I have tried to formulate these in language that\nengineers can follow, but without losing their force for the legal and quasi-legal\nprofessionals.\nChapter 9 points up the general economic consequences of the above prob\nlems.\nIf in the end I am considered to have been too harsh on the courts of our\nland, my answer must be that my position is based on more than mere academic\nstudy. My attack is considered, deliberate, and to me necessary. My plea is\nsimple. Before it is too late, let us restore to the individual his importance and\ndignity, and recognize and protect the fruits of his mind. A dynamic society\nled by free and encouraged creative minds - with government back in its role of\nservant and partner - offers the Free World's best hope.\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 1\nThe Origin and Development of The\nAmerican Patent System\nThis chapter presents a survey of the historical background of the\nAmerican patent system and, at its conclusion, raises serious ques\ntions as to whether that system is currently either performing effec\ntively the original historical purposes or meeting the needs of the\npresent.\n\"Oysters stuffed with honey\" may sound like a gastronomic nightmare. To\nthe authorities of the Greek colony of Sybaris 1, some five hundred years before\nChrist, however, it may well have been \"an unusual and peculiar dish\" that no\none had the right to prepare and serve for a one-year period but the cook who\noriginated it.\nThis official invitation to indigestion is one of the earliest recorded instances\nof a grant paralleling somewhat our concept of a patent granted for an inven\ntion. The policy of grants of numerous kinds by the state to individuals who\nhad deserved well at its hands was inherited by medieval Europe from early\ntimes. Rome, for example, had rewarded her military heroes with triumphal\nprocessions, and had parceled out to them her conquered lands, upon which\nthey might levy taxes. English monarchs exercised the prerogative of granting\na right, franchise, charter, commission, office, monopoly, or the like - for exam\nple, a title of nobility or permission to explore the New World. They did so in\neach case through the medium of a document addressed \"To all to whom these\npresents shall come,\" an open document termed \"Litterae Patentes\" or Letters\nPatent - letters openly recorded in the Patent Rolls.\nThat the English king had good reason for granting at least some kinds of\nletters patent, under proper circumstances, can be understood from the follow\ning considerations.\nMedieval Europe was a barbarous or semibarbarous ter\nritory, not far removed from savagery. Industry and trade were in a precari\nous condition. The nobles, not only in England but also on the Continent, as\n1Athenaeus; The Deipnosophists (3 Vols.), C. D. Yonge, Ed. , Bohn's Classical Library,\n1854, p. 835.\n\nCreate or Perish\nrulers supreme in their particular domains, demanded tolls from all who passed\nthrough their territories. They could do this uncontrolled by their supposedly\nsuperior monarchs, by fortifying themselves on hillsides and other places of ad\nvantage. Not until the invention of gunpowder were these monarchs able to\nbring their nobles under subjection.\nThe trade of those days was conducted by merchants who traveled from coun\ntry to country through the domains of various nobles. Because the merchants\nwere subjected to great expense and risk in the carrying on of their business,\nthey were compelled to charge very high prices for the goods that they intro\nduced for sale in Europe. Many articles were expensive luxuries beyond the\nreach of all but the very wealthiest.\nThe Crusades, beginning in the eleventh century A.D. and continuing for\nseveral centuries more, brought the Europeans into contact with the Saracens,\nat that time a comparatively highly cultured people. They had developed the\narts and were skilled in such sciences as algebra and astronomy, the very word\n\"algebra\" coming from the Arabic.\nUpon returning to their homes, the Crusaders carried with them much that\nthey had found in the East, including knowledge of various arts and industries.\nItalian city-states, such as Genoa and Venice, the most powerful groups of their\nday, developed as a direct result of their proximity to the East. They prospered\nbecause of the trade that they had built up between the East and the West.\nIn order to have something to sell, in return for the goods they obtained in\nthe East, they stimulated new arts and industries by granting monopolies to\nfavored individuals who were willing to take the risks involved. Early grants are\nreported for grain mills, and in 1474 the Venetian Senate voted the first of all\npatent laws applying to all classes of invention. This law forbade infringement\nfor a term of ten years, but gave free access to the government, provided that the\nlatter dealt with the inventor and did not permit others to employ the invention\nin the government's behalf 2 .\nTo protect their trade and the industries they had established, European\nmerchants banded together for common defense organized their own armies\nand navies. During the late Middle Ages they became quite powerful, as the\nHanseatic League attests.\nNot until several centuries later, when new trade\nroutes were opened up after the discovery of the New World, were the Italian\ncity-states reduced to their present status as subdivisions of a larger nation.\nBut the Italian cities were not the only communities thus benefited. The\ngoods and skills germinated by this trade with the East gradually spread over\nthe whole of Europe. Because England was the farthest west and physically\nseparated from the continent, it was not in the most favored position to secure\nthese advantages, which the other states often guarded jealously. To overcome\nthese disadvantages the English monarchs adopted the continental practice of\ngranting patents, usually to foreigners, giving them for limited periods of time\n2This statement is based on information given me by some British patent lawyers who\nremembered hearing a paper entitled, \"The Early History of Patents of Patents for Invention,\"\ngiven by M. Frumian before the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents in England sometime\nin the 1930's.\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nthe exclusive right to carry on such new industries as, in consideration of the\ngrant, they agreed to import into the realm.\nIn this way the cloth industry was introduced into England. In 1331, Edward\nIII granted a patent to John Kempe of Flanders, weaver of woolen cloth, and in\n1336 to Brabant weavers. In 1440, one was issued to John of Shiedame to enable\nhim to import a newly invented process of manufacturing salt3 . The Tudors,\nsuccessors of Edward IV, attracted skilled foreign artisans by negotiations -\nGerman armorers, Italian shipwrights, Normandy glassmakers, and French iron\nworkers4 .\nPatents were also given to individuals and companies for other services to the\nstate, to induce them to embark upon commercial or other ventures involving\nrisk. Among these were the East India Trading Company, chartered by Queen\nElizabeth I, and the Hudsons's Bay Company, still very much a commercial\nforce in Canada, chartered by her immediate successor.\nIn the then relatively undeveloped state of industry and commerce, patents\nof this nature were undoubtedly necessary for the good of the realm and the well\nbeing of its subjects. The objects sought thereby were: first, domestic supply\nof foreign, high-priced goods which would reduce their cost and consequently\nencourage their wider use; and, secondly, employment for English workmen in\nthe new industries thus established. Some of the patents, indeed, specifically\nprovided that English apprentices be employed.\nGomme, late librarian of the British Patent Office5, for example, quotes from\nthe 1449 patent granted by Henry VI to John of Utynam, \". . . to instruct divers\nlieges of the crown in the art of making colored glass.\" It is reported6 that the\nprecipitating cause of this patent grant was the requirement for colored windows\nat Eton College.\nMuch later, the Court of King's Bench clearly enunciated the rationale of\nsuch patents:\nBut if a man hath brought in a new invention and a new trade within\nthe Kingdom, in peril of his life, and consumption of his estate or\nstock . . . or if a man hath made a new discovery of anything, in such\ncases the King . . . in recompense of his costs and travail, may grant\nby charter unto him, that he only shall use such a trade or trafique\nfor a certain time, because at first the people of the Kingdom are\nignorant, and have not the knowledge or skill to use it7 .\nBut beneficent measures are frequently attended by abuses.\nIn granting\ntheir patents, the English kings did not always consider whether or not these\nconferred benefits upon their subjects.\nThe latters' revolt against King John at Runnymede, in 1215, resulted in\nthe famous Magna Carta. The monarch there had to agree that merchants were\n3A. A. Gomme, Patents of Invention, Longmans Green and Co., 1946, p. 12\n4Journal of the Patent Office Society, Vol. 18, pp. 21ff. (1936).\n5A. A. Gomme, Patents of Invention, p. 12\n6H. Hardin, Patent Office Centenary, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1953, pp. 21, 34.\n778 Eng. Rep. 148 (Clothworkers of Ipswich, King's Bench, 1615).\n\nCreate or Perish\nnot to be prohibited from engaging in trade, \"if they were not openly prohibited\nbefore.\" This suggests no upsetting of current patents in trade, but restrictions\non the monarch's power to grant further patents in existing trades.\nThe Magna Carta was not the only contract that the English kings made\nwith their subjects. History shows, however, that the monarchs regarded these\nagreements much as some nations today regard treaties. When, under force of\ncircumstances, kings were compelled to submit to greater force, as in the case\nof John at Runnymede, they signed anything that was put before them; but,\nas soon as the danger was over, they forgot their promises and acted as though\nthey had never given them.\nIn their endeavors to raise money, to reward favorites, and for other reasons,\nsucceeding English monarchs thus granted many patents that became burden\nsome to the people. One person would be given the exclusive right to engage\nin a certain industry, such as tanning; another to trade in soap, salt, starch,\nsaltpeter, leather, paper or glass; another to buy and sell iron or steel; and still\nanother to import certain articles; and so on. Sometimes the monopoly covered\ntrade in all England; at other times, the sale of a particular article in a partic\nular region. As the activities so monopolized had previously been free to the\npublic, the only result was to raise prices which must be paid by the many, that\nthe favored patentees might be enriched.\nIn the fall of 1601, in response to protests, Queen Elizabeth I proclaimed that\nif any of her subjects felt aggrieved or wronged by reason of any of these patent\ngrants, he could test the validity of the patent in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe very next spring, 1602, one Edward D'Arcy brought suit for infringement of\nhis patent grant for making and importing playing cards. The justification for\nthe patent grant had been based upon grounds of public policy, that unless the\ngrant existed subjects who might better \"go to plow did employ themselves in\nthe art of making cards8.\" This is the famous Case of Monopolies. Though the\ncourt held the monopoly on playing cards to be invalid, the case has come down\nthe ages as recognizing the existence of something most important, namely the\nline of division between what is proper and what is improper subject matter for\na patent \"monopoly.\" To quote from the decision,\nWhere any man by his own charge and industry or by his own wit\nor invention doth bring any new trade into the Realm of any Engine\ntending to the furtherance of a trade that never was used before;\nAnd that for the good of the Realm; That in such cases the King\nmay grant to him a monopoly patent for some reasonable time until\nthe subjects may learn the same, in consideration of the good that\nhe doth bring by his Invention to the Commonwealth; otherwise not.\nThis has been the law in England up to the present time. One can still\nobtain a patent in Great Britain, not merely for an invention that he has made,\nbut also for a new article or idea imported from outside the realm.\n8D'Arcy v. Allen, 11 Coke 86 (1602), known as the Case of Monopolies.\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nNotwithstanding the D'Arcy decision, the very next monarch, James I, who\nascended the throne in 1603, granted more monopolies than ever, including some\nfor silk and even inns. The cry against harmful monopolies in Great Britain\naccordingly grew in vigor, until, finally, by the Statute of Monopolies in 1623,\nParliament deprived the sovereign completely of this prerogative.\nThe Statute of Monopolies made an exception, however, in favor of patents\nfor inventions - the very same exception that the judges had indicated in the\nD'Arcy case, and which was really, in effect, declaratory of the common law, i.\ne., that no special privilege would be granted for \" . . . any letters patent and\ngrants of privilege for the term of fourteen years or under hereafter to be made\nof the sole working or making of any manner of new manufacture within this\nRealm to the true and first inventor and inventors of such manufactures which\nother at the time of making of such letters patent and grants shall not use so\nas also they be not contrary to the law nor mischievous to the State by raising\nprices of commodities at home or hurt of trade or generally inconvenient9.\"\nBoth the English and the American laws of patents10 come directly from\nthis exception for inventions, and the very provision quoted above still exists as\nSection 6 of the present British Statute of Monopolies.\nThe American colonists were fully acquainted with patents, and knew their\nvalue under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Statute of Monopolies.\nLike the mother country, several of the colonies, prior to the Constitutional\nConvention, had granted patents in the endeavor to introduce industries. The\npatents were not necessarily for new inventions, but sometimes for old industries,\nif brought in from abroad, and also for fostering those struggling for survival.\nThe encouragement of industries was achieved not only by the grant of monop\nolies in special enactments of the local legislature, corresponding to the English\ngrants from the Crown, but also through the medium of premiums, bounties,\nand the like.\nFully aware, when granting these perquisites, of the monopolistic evils in\nthe country whence they had come, the colonists took precautions against a\nrepetition of those evils. For example, the Massachusetts General Court (the\ncolonial legislature) in 1641 enacted that \"There shall be no monopolies granted\nor allowed among us, but of such new inventions as are profitable to the country,\nand that for a short time.\" Connecticut had a similar provision. Massachusetts,\nConnecticut, Virginia, South Carolina, New York, and other colonies granted\na number of patents covering different methods of making salt, some invented\nand others imported, and sometimes on condition that saltworks be established\nwithin a limited time. Similar patents covering the exclusive manufacture of\nother articles, and often on similar conditions, were granted by the colonists.\nThese included the manufacture of iron and of machinery, a sawmill, a grain\nmill, and a tobacco pipe factory.\nThe first patent granted by the Massachusetts General Court, pursuant to\nthe enactment of 1641, was one to Samuel Winslow (1641) for a novel method\n9Statute of Monopolies, 21 Jac. I, C.3 (1623).\n10Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 327, 328; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co.,\n243 U.S. 502, 510, 511.\n\nCreate or Perish\nof making salt. The first machinery patent granted by the same body was to\nJoseph Jenkes, in 1646, for a scythe-manufacturing mill. In 1667, Massachusetts\noffered a fifteen-year monopoly to anyone who would build a dry dock, and, the\noffer apparently not proving sufficiently attractive, the term of years was in\ncreased in the following year to twenty-one. Several of the colonies continued to\ngrant patents, even after they became states upon the adoption of the Constitu\ntion. New York, for example, issued one to Livingston and Fulton covering the\nexclusive right to operate steamboats in New York waters, a patent later an\nnulled by Chief Justice Marshall as being in violation of the interstate-commerce\nclause of the Constitution.\nThe delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, fully familiar with\nall the circumstances, desired to provide the new nation with the benefits of\na patent system.\nBoth James Madison of Virginia and Charles Pinckney of\nSouth Carolina, therefore, proposed that Congress be given certain powers in\nthat direction. Madison's proposal was that it should have power: \"To secure to\nliterary authors their copyrights for a limited time. To encourage by premiums\nand provisions, the advance of useful knowledge and discoveries.\"\nParenthetically, the Atomic Energy Commission is doing the very thing to\nday that Madison suggested so long ago11 . Certain types of inventions deal\ning with the production of fissionable material and atomic weapons cannot be\npatented under the exclusion provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. An inventor\nmay, however, make a claim for remuneration for his contribution, and, un\nder certain standards that have been set up, may be awarded a sum of money\nby the Commission. From a study of the unclassified awards and experience\nwith the AEC, some authorities believe that the Constitutional founders were\nmost wise in rejecting Madison's proposal. They are convinced that the failure\nof the nuclear program to get off the ground more rapidly and extensively, in\nthe way and to the same degree that our free-enterprise inventive efforts with\nother nongovernment-controlled programs have historically blossomed for the\ncommon good, may be due, in part, to the inadequacy of this kind of so-called\nincentive.\nCharles Pinckney disliked Madison's proposal that the government should\nevaluate and pay out sums of money for inventions. His own proposal was that\nCongress should have the power \"to grant patents for useful inventions.\nTo\nsecure to authors exclusive rights for a certain time.\" Under this concept, the\ncompetitive industrial marketplace would determine the value of an invention.\nAs it emerged from committee and as adopted by the Convention, the Con\nstitution provided, and still provides, in Article I, Section 8, that Congress shall\nhave power: \"To promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by secur\ning for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their\nrespective Writings and Discoveries.\"\nPursuant to this provision, Congress could have granted to a person who\nmakes a scientific discovery the exclusive right to his own discovery. The Con\n1142 U.S.C. 2187 (Sec. 157). (The abbreviation U.S.C. refers to the United States Code -\na collected body of federal law.)\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nstitution uses the words \"Science,\" \"exclusive right,\" \"discoveries 12.\" As will\nbe made evident, however, Congress has provided for exclusive rights only in\ncases of certain kinds of advances and not for scientific discoveries per se.\nThis provision is the only one in the whole Constitution which relates to the\ncreation of private property rights and was intended to promote the progress of\nscience and the useful arts. It rested on the great tradition and philosophy of\nour capitalistic system - the granting of limited protection to the individual in\ndeveloping ideas for the benefit of the many.\nNothing, it will be noted, is said in this provision about granting patents\nas such. The word \"securing\" is used instead. Madison later explained, in the\nFederalist papers, that, though the word \"securing\" was appropriate only in\nconnection with copyrights, which had been recognized as a natural property\nright at common law, there was no reason why the same principles should not\napply to inventions: \"The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason\nto belong to the inventors. The public seems with equal reason to belong to\nthe inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of\nindividuals.\"\nJefferson, however, declined to accept the view that inventions belonged to\ninventors as a natural right. He felt that they were for the benefit of the whole\nsociety.\nAfter the adoption of the Constitution, President Washington recommended\nlegislation in furtherance of this constitutional provision, and a statute was\nenacted by the very first Congress, in 1790. The founders of the Union thought\nthe matter so important that they provided therein that the Secretary of State\n(Thomas Jefferson), in collaboration with the Secretary of War (Henry Knox\nof Massachusetts) and the Attorney General (Edmund Randolph of Virginia),\nshould examine all patent applications, and the President and the Secretary of\nState should personally sign the patent grant. That body of three eminent men,\nJefferson, Knox, and Randolph, in effect constituted the first Patent Office of\nthis country, with Jefferson the first patent examiner, commissioner, and lawyer.\nWashington, Jefferson, and Randolph signed the first patents.\nJefferson, though, opposed to all forms of monopoly, and at first including\npatents in this category, was compelled as a result of his experience to state that\nthe patent law gave \"a spring to invention beyond my conception,\" and that,\ntherefore, \"nobody wishes more that I that ingenuity should receive a liberal\nencouragement13.\"\nBefore a patent could be issued under the law of 1790, it was necessary\nthat the application be carefully examined to determine whether the purported\ninvention, in the terms of the statute, was \"before known or used\" and whether it\nwas really \"sufficiently useful and important\" to warrant the dignity of a patent\n12There is a great doubt whether this word \"Science\" as used in the Constitution, meant\nwhat we mean today. My own study leads me to the conviction that the term \"science\" in\nthe constitutional sense, was used, rather, with philosophical and literary concepts primarily\nin mind.\n13In a letter to Oliver Evans, May 2, 1807, as given in The Writings of Thomas Jefferson,\nA.

Chaos followed - frauds, vexatious litigations,\nmultiple conflicting patents, and so on.\nAt the urging of Senator John Ruggles of Maine, some forty-odd year later,\nthe \"American\" system of granting patents only after examination was rein\nstated by the Patent Act of 1836 , and the Patent Office was reorganized and\nestablished as a separate bureau of the State Department, with the bureau chief\nformally titled commissioner of patents. The Patent Office was subsequently\ntransferred to the Department of the Interior, upon the latter's establishment\nin 1849; and later, in 1926, it was given its present status in the Department of\nCommerce. There has long been, and still is, agitation for making the Patent\nOffice an entirely separate executive branch14, perhaps with expanded functions\nmore suited to current national needs. But such expanded and modernized func\ntions still seem to fit in the responsibilities of the Department of Commerce.\n14Journal of the Patent Office Society, Vol. 40, pp. 10 - 17 (1958).\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\n1.1\nConclusion\nIt is important to note that the historical purposes that lay behind our patent\nsystem were primarily concerned with the matter of innovation and not bald\ninvention alone.\nThe object was not merely to grant patents; rather it was to encourage the\nfew inventive minds among us to take the risks inherent in introducing new\nproducts and arts or processes into the stream of commerce, for the ultimate\nbenefit of the many.\nThis encouragement took the form of a contract: the\nsovereign offering the inventor limited protection against copying in return for\nthe publication of the details of his invention; and it rested upon the theory,\nnow ironically applied more effectively by the Soviets than by us, that rewards\nto the individual benefit the public at large.\nAn additional purpose was to prevent, through the publication of inventions\nin patents, a recurrence of loss of arts such as had happened formerly when\nknowledge was handed down from father to son secretly.\nBut whether today's patent system in America, its administration and its\ntreatment by the judiciary, is an effective stimulus to innovation, has become a\nquestion of the utmost importance and urgency.\nDoes the system offer that kind of security to the inventor and his backers\nthat stimulates ready embarkation upon the risky road of innovation?\nDo its rewards stimulate the myriad engineers who, as a condition of their\nemployment in much of industry and government, have assigned to their em\nployers all their rights to any inventions they may make?\nHas its use in certain large corporate quarters been reduced largely to de\nfensive and cross-licensing needs, as distinguished from protecting an exclusive\nposition as a stimulus to innovation?\nAre we today really worried about \"lost arts\"?\nDoes the system promote the progress of useful military, nuclear, and space\narts?\nIn short, has our patent system been largely reduced in many fields to the\ngranting of papers with red seals - mostly form and little substance?\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 2\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the\nCourts\nFor the benefit of readers unfamiliar with the details of patent appli\ncation prosecution and judicial review, the role of the Patent Office\nand courts is herein summarized.\nIn view of the multiple-function purpose of this book and diversity of back\ngrounds of its hoped-for readers, a brief review is in order of the processes\ninvolved in filing and prosecuting patent applications in the Patent Office and\nthe role of the courts of the land in patent litigation. This chapter, obviously,\nwill be of little interest for those knowledgeable in this field.\nPerhaps an interesting way to trace the procedure would be to stand in the\nshoes of an imaginary independent inventor in the first flush of success in the\ncompletion of an invention. In order to obtain a patent for it, he must submit\nfor examination by the Patent Office a detailed description that, by law, must\nbe in a certain subscribed form and be couched in legal terminology generally\nquite foreign to those who produce inventions as well as to nonlegal persons\nin general. The patent application itself must contain a clear and concise de\nscription of the invention (termed here the specification), usually with reference\nto drawings illustrating a preferred form of the device, and a set of succinct\nterminal paragraphs, called claims, setting forth the features of novelty which\nthe inventor and his attorney believe the Patent Office should allow as defining\nthe scope of the patent grant.\n2.1\nThe Nature of the Patent Office\nIt will be remembered that the Constitution authorized Congress to promote\nthe progress of useful arts by securing to inventors for limited periods of time\nthe exclusive rights to their discoveries. It has previously been pointed out,\nhowever, that, apart from a few questionably-handled procedures, as under\nthe compensation provisions of the Atomic Energy Act or the Space Act, pure\nscientists have not been rewarded by Congress. Instead, the latter has seen fit\nto enact patent laws applicable to the applied scientist and engineer, who takes\n\nCreate or Perish\nthe discoveries of the pure scientist and makes useful arts out of them. In 1952,\nCongress codified the patent laws, adding, however certain modifications that\npurported to eliminate or at least curb the disposition of some courts to strike\ndown patents as a matter of social philosophy.\nThe statute itself defines the structure of the Patent Office and the mode\nof its operation, charging the commissioner of patents with the responsibility\nfor the examination of every patent application and for the issuance of every\npatent (and trademark). Thus the Patent Office must maintain a vast up-to-date\ntechnical library, otherwise the patent examiners assisting the commissioner will\nnot have the facilities for making reasonably thorough investigations.\nThe commissioner is further assisted by an appellate board in the Patent\nOffice, termed the Board of Appeals. The members of the Board, like the com\nmissioner, are appointed by the president and are given the title of examiners-\nin-chief. Their function is primarily to pass on final rejections by the examining\ncorps which deny the patentability of the claimed inventions. Fortunately, they\nare selected from the experienced ranks of the Patent Office personnel and are\nnot, as yet, purely political appointees.\nBefore our inventor's newly filed patent application is examined for novelty, it\nis screened by classification examiners to determine whether the subject matter\nproperly relates to the class of inventions handled by a particular group of\nskilled examiners. Since, however, applications are normally examined in the\norder received, and since there is, on the average, a year's backlog of cases, our\ninventor will probably have to wait that long before his application is reached.\nWhen the examiner assigned to the case reaches the application, he (or\nshe) studies it with particular attention to the claims of novelty which he is\nrequested to allow. These claims, if allowed, represent the metes and bounds or\nscope of the patent grant. The examiner then goes to the division files of patents\nand publications, which are broken down into many thousands of classes and\nsubclasses, and starts his search. He is looking for the prior art that is closest to\nthe concept claimed to be new. He looks not only for the exact device described\nin the application, but also for others similar to it. If the patent attorney in\nthe case has made his own search before filing the application and failed to find\nan exact anticipation, it is likely that the examiner will not find one either.\nHowever, even if the invention is not found in any prior patent or publication,\nbut is the kind of thing that any mechanic skilled is the art could easily evolve\nfrom what is in a prior patent or publication, the device is not patentable.\nHaving completed his search, the examiner usually takes the course of re\njecting the application on the basis of the closest prior art that he was able\nto find. There is a very definite reason for this. Being a conscientious public\nservant, the examiner is not disposed to hand out patents unless he is convinced\nthat a really new invention has been made 1 . By rejecting the case, he puts the\nburden of proof on the applicant to explain why the latter should be granted a\n1If our judiciary could only experience, as practicing lawyers, the difficulty involved in\nsuccessfully prosecuting a patent application in the Patent Office, their respect for patents\nwould undoubtedly increase\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\npatent although others may have come as close to his purported invention as in\nthe prior art cited by the examiner.\nThe attorney for the applicant must then reply within six months of the\nexaminer's rejection, pointing out why the prior art is not pertinent to his\nclient's claim of novelty, and, if the original claims did not clearly define that\nnovelty, appropriately amending those claims.\nThis process of rejection (or\npartial rejection) and amendment or argument continues until the examiner\nfeels that an issue has been reached. In some cases, the examiner will allow the\namended claims or, upon reconsideration, the original claims, or some of them,\nand the patent will thereupon be granted and will take its place among over\nthree million United States patents. In other cases, the examiner will not be\npersuaded as to the matter of invention. The applicant's attorney insists; the\nexaminer is adamant that there is no invention and makes his rejection final.\nSometimes the attorney will interview the examiner in person. He may then\nask the primary examiner to review the assistant's decisions. At a conference,\nthe assistant examiner gives the primary examiner his reasons for rejection,\nand the attorney presents his side of the case, perhaps with the help from the\ninventor himself. The primary examiner then makes his decision. If he agrees\nwith the attorney, he overrules his assistant and allows the application so that\nthey patent may issue. If, on the other hand, he feels that the assistant is right,\nhe will not overrule him, but will suggest that the attorney turn to the Board\nof Appeals.\nThe attorney, in the latter event, files a brief before the Board in which\nhe describes the history of the case, the nature and details of the invention,\nthe meaning of the rejected claims, the prior art cited by the examiner upon\nwhich the adverse ruling was based, and the reasons, factual and legal, why the\nattorney considers the examiner to be in error. The examiner then files a reply\nbrief presenting his views, and the case may be decided by the Board of Appeals\non these two briefs alone. An oral argument may, however, be requested. The\nattorney will appear before the Board to argue his case, but the examiner from\nwhom the appeal is taken usually does not appear at the hearing.\nThe Board may then sustain the examiner's rejection, or overrule it and\norder the patent to be granted. Sometimes the Board finds that, while it cannot\nsustain the examiner's position, the claims are not patentable for reasons other\nthan those advanced by the examiner. In such an event, it will offer its own\ngrounds for rejection, permitting the applicant to modify his claims in order to\novercome the new objections or to ask for reconsideration of the new grounds.\nWhenever two or more applicants are claiming the same invention, \"inter\nference\" examiners are assigned the task of trying to determine who is actually\nthe first inventor. Testimony is usually taken before a notary public or court\nofficer, subject to cross-examination, and other evidence of invention activities\nsubmitted by the conflicting applicants. Aided by these, as well as by briefs and\noral argument, a Board of Patent Interferences makes a decision as to who is\nthe prior inventor.\nThe commissioner cannot by himself, of course, decide or give attention to\nthe administration of all these matters. He therefore has several assistant com\n\nCreate or Perish\nmissioners of patents. And, parenthetically, lest it be considered that Russians\nare the only ones who utilize the talents of women in technical fields, we have\nrecently been ably served by a lady assistant commissioner of patents on matters\nregarding trademarks.\n2.2\nPatent Office Problems\nWhen there is a rapid turnover in the examining crops because of attractive\noffers from outside organizations, particularly to the younger examiners, the\nbacklog of cases obviously mounts. The effectiveness and utility of the whole\npatent system are thereby damaged. Perhaps the greater administrative prob\nlems facing the Patent Office, therefore, are, first convincing the public and\nCongress of the importance of its functions; and, second, the urgent necessity\nfor promptly dignifying the position of examiner so that it will attract competent\ncareer men and women.\nAutomation in the form of electronic computers may come to help in the\nsearching process. Indeed, an interesting experiment for facilitating the exam\niner's search in certain limited chemical cases by computer techniques is under\nway.\nWhether sufficient time and money will ever be provided to effect the copious\ncross-referencing in the electrical and electronic fields, as well as in the mechani\ncal fields, necessary for the employment of computers in the task of searching, is\na real question. An inventor who files an application for a new vacuum tube, for\nexample, might find anticipation of his tube tucked away in a prior patent for a\nradio-receiver circuit, in which prior patent the very same tube might have been\nshown incidentally, but not claimed as part of the invention. The disclosure of\nthe earlier tube would, however, be a bar to patenting the new one. Unless the\ninformation was entered into the computer that this tube construction was dis\nclosed, though not claimed, in the radio-receiver patent, it will not be furnished\nby the computer. Today, however, an examiner, in scanning a patent, can notice\nsuch incidental disclosures not predicted by the title or normal classifications of\nthe patent.\nThere is, accordingly, the stupendous problem of cross-referencing the minu\ntiae and classifying every tiny component of all the combinations shown and de\nscribed in patents, if computer searching is to be successful. This is something\nthat, to some of us, looks quite impractical as yet. Classifying certain kinds of\nchemical compounds may be something else again.\nIn 1935, only 31,900 applications still awaited preliminary or further action\nby the examiners, i.e., were \"pending.\" Recently, there were almost a quarter of\na million of them 2 . And there are pending before the Board of Appeals about\n6,000 cases, and some hearings have been set for more than a year after the\nappeal was entered.\nThe problem of speeding up the granting of patents, consistent with reason\nably thorough examination and consideration, and particularly in the light of\n2Senate Report No. 1430, Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Congress, 2d\nSession (1958)\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nlimited budget and personnel, is thus still with us, though great strides have\nbeen made in keeping the Patent Office more nearly up-to-date.\n2.3\nReview of Patent Office Decisions\nSuppose the Board of Appeals concurs with the examiner that an application\ndiscloses no patentable invention, and thus decides adversely to the applicant.\nCongress has provided two alternative remedies in the nature of court review of\nsuch decision 3 .\nOne is to file a suit against the commissioner of patents in the Federal\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia 4 . The complainant may ask the\njudge to review the adverse decision of the Board of Appeals, to hear the case\nfor patentability of the invention afresh (a so-called action de novo), and to\nconsider new and more detailed evidence as to the invention underlying the\napplication and the reasons why the patent should be awarded. The District\nCourt judge will either sustain the Patent Office rejection of the application\nor, if he disagrees with the Board of Appeals, direct that a patent be issued.\nAt this trial, the commissioner is represented by his own solicitor, who cross-\nexamines the applicant's witnesses and may present witnesses on behalf of the\ncommissioner.\nFrom an adverse decision of the District Court, one may appeal to the Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A final review by way of an\nappeal petition termed \"certiorari\" may be asked of the United States Supreme\nCourt if the Court of Appeals refuses to reverse the Patent Office; but the\nSupreme Court is not apt presently to grant patents.\nIf, on the other hand, the applicant does not wish to go into Federal District\nCourt, and is well satisfied with the evidence existing in the record of the prose\ncution of the application in the Patent Office, he can alternatively appeal to the\nCourt of Customs and Patent Appeals, strictly upon that record 5 . This court\nwas originally a so-called legislative court, set up under the provisions of Article\nI of the Constitution to serve as a tribunal of Congress, as distinguished from\nthe judicial courts of Article III, such as the Federal District Courts, Courts of\nAppeals, and the Supreme Court. Congress has recently, however, converted\nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals into a judicial court established un\nder Article III. Five judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals hear\nappeals both from customs decisions and from patent decisions. In the past,\nthese judges have not been technically trained people, though recently patent\nlawyers have been considered for the bench and appointed to it, and the Court\nis looking more and more to them with regard to appeals from the Patent Office.\nIf the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Customs\nand Patent Appeals, he has the opportunity of petitioning for certiorari to the\nUnited States Supreme Court; but, within recent years, such petitions have not\nbeen granted. Similarly, when dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of\n3The same remedies apply to trademarks and design patent cases also\n435 U.S.C. 145\n535 U.S.C. 141\n\nCreate or Perish\nPatent Interferences, the losing party may appeal to the Court of Customs and\nPatent Appeals, or may bring a suit in an appropriate District Court to have\nthe Patent Office decision reversed, offering fresh testimony and evidence.\n2.4\nThe Present Mood of the Courts\nThe courts of the District of Columbia are called upon, at times, to review not\nonly the decisions of the Patent Office, but also the actions of nearly every federal\nadministrative officer or tribunal. The Federal Communications Commission\nwill award a radio station to party A rather than to party B; or the Secretary of\nthe Interior will issue a land grant or a mineral lease to one party rather than to\nanother; or the Secretary of State will deny the issuance of a passport; or some\nemployee of the Army considers that he has lost his position unjustly. Persons\ndissatisfied with many administrative decisions come to the various courts of\nthe District of Columbia each year. It is, of course, asking too much of a judge\nthat he be skilled in the technical intricacies of all the matters handled by the\nvarious administrative agencies which, indeed, are presumably staffed by experts\ntrained in the pertinent technical subject matters. Accordingly, the judge does\nnot undertake in such cases to substitute his own fact finding for that of the\nadministrative agency, except under rare circumstances. The courts have held\nvery wisely that unless there is abuse by the administrative agency, unless the\nparties had not been given a fair hearing, unless there is no substantial evidence\nto support the agency's decision, or unless that decision is unconscionable and\nclearly erroneous, a court will not upset the administrative agency's findings\neven though, considering all the evidence, it might itself have decided the fact\nissues differently. A court will of course, maintain its important function of\ninterpreting the law issues, and will readily substitute its interpretation of the\nlaw for that of the agency.\nSuits against the commissioner of patents in the District Court for the Dis\ntrict of Columbia are upon a little different footing, since the statute permits\nthe District Court to receive new evidence not before the Patent Office nor con\nsidered by it and to make a decision based upon all the facts presented. During\nthe relatively recent past, however, the Patent Office has been sustained in case\nafter case by the District Court, apparently no matter what new evidence was\noffered 6 .\nSubsequent to the recent Patent Act of 1952 , which was intended to ex\nercise a stabilizing effect upon court treatment of patents, there have been a\nnumber of reversals of the Patent Office. Some judges of the Court of Appeals\nof the District of Columbia, however, are apparently still hostile, as indicated\nby dissenting Judge Danaher 7:\nThe philosophy permeating the majority opinion basically is one\n6Attention is invited to the anomaly (unless one recognizes the hostility to patents) of the\ncourt's giving such great weight to the Patent Office findings of no invention when it has\ndeclined to grant a patent, and such little weight to its findings of invention and the resulting\nstatutory presumption of validity in suits for infringement of patents granted by it\n7Watson v. Bersworth, 727 O.G. 445, 251 F. 2d 898.\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nof nullification of the remedy provided by Congress, a result hear\nreached (1) by according to the Patent Office the equivalent of a\nconclusive presumption of correctness; and (2) by holding that suffi\nciently of disclosure raises a question of law. Relegated to zero status\nis the District Court, with its finding, its conclusions, its memoran\ndum opinion and its judgment. Judge Wilkin heard many witnesses,\nhad the benefit of charts and exhibits, received detailed explanations\nas to the points in issue and possessed the advantage of colloquy with\nthe opposing counsel. The record discloses close and careful atten\ntion to the many aspects of the case brought under 35 U.S.C. 145\nwhich permits a dissatisfied applicant to pursue his remedy in the\nDistrict Court with may adjudge the applicant entitled to receive a\npatent \"as the facts of the case may appear.\"\nWe recently pointed out that under governing case law and the Fed\neral Rules, even as to patent cases, \"a finding of fact by the District\nCourt, sitting without jury, may be set aside on appeal only if it is\nclearly erroneous.\" We noted that in such situations we are bound to\ninquire whether the District Court's findings are clearly erroneous.\nHere, no effort is made by the majority to demonstrate that Judge\nWilkin's findings are \"clearly wrong\" or \"clearly erroneous.\" They\nare simply are peremptorily spurned as meaningless and nugatory in\nthe context of the majority's treatment of the problem. I shall later\nundertake to show that the District Judge, with thorough conviction,\narrived at his amply supported findings on the new evidence before\nhim. I fail to see how we could have otherwise than he did.\nAnd, more recently, Judge Burger of the Court of Appeals for the District\nof Columbia stated that, while he was \"compelled\" to follow the \"present state\nof the decisions\" in sustaining the Patent Office holding of no invention, he felt\nthat those decisions\nimpose barriers to patents far more stringent than contemplated\neither in the first instance by the Constitution or later by Congress\n8 .\nJudge Burger continued,\nThis case illustrates, to me, the inhospitable attitude toward patents.\nstemming in part from our natural aversion to monopolies. From\nthe premise that monopolies are bad, it is argued that patents being\nmonopolies are at least suspect. But a patent is a monopoly primar\nily in a technical dictionary sense, much as is ownership of land, and\nwe ought not let our reason be clouded by semantics.\nThis lack of hospitality toward patents is suggested in the argument,\nsometimes made here by counsel for the Patent Office, that Buck\n8Boehringer Sohn v. Watson, 256 F. 2d 712, 714.\n\nCreate or Perish\nRogers comic strips which depict rockets, jets, and the space age\nwill no doubt operate and be cited as \"anticipation\" of some patent\napplications for such devices as the fertile brain of the cartoonist de\npicts for the children. It appears that unrestrained imagination, un\nburdened by any responsibility for the hard, patient and painstaking\nwork of development, car bar future patent protection for the men\nand women who actually implement and carry out the prediction\nand prophecies of the Buck Rogers comic strips and the \"Fantastic\nStories\" of the paperback trade. Indeed, Patent Office counsel advice\nus that Rube Goldberg cartoons have been used for this same pur\npose. This hardly seems the way to encourage maximum incentive\nfor those engaged in research and invention. This could mean that\nwidespread research and experimentation in these areas might well,\nby economic necessity or default, ultimately become a Government\nmonopoly.\nWe can hope, accordingly, that the remedy in the federal courts, intended by\nCongress to grant relief from improper Patent Office decision, will ultimately be\ninterpreted to have been restored by the Patent Act of 1952 to patent applicants.\n2.5\nThe Reports of Patent Office and Court Decisions\nScientists have their journals describing the latest advances in the various tech\nnological fields. Similarly, lawyers have the reports of the various administrative\nlaw tribunals, such as the Patent Office, and of the courts, containing decisions\nin litigated cases that illustrate the current legal interpretations placed upon the\nvarious statutes and regulations, as well as how various types of factual situa\ntions are currently treated by such tribunals and courts. From these decisions,\nas thus reported, a lawyer, through the process of analogy, tries to answer a\nclient's questions as to whether or not his invention is patentable, and what his\nlegal rights may be in various situations.\nIn its weekly Official Gazette, the Patent Office publishes, in addition to\nregulations, rules, notices, and reports of interesting Patent Office or court de\ncisions, a brief notice of every patent that has been granted during the week.\nThat notice includes a typical drawing from the patent application, where ap\npropriate, and a typical claim, perhaps representative of the scope of the patent\ngrant 9 . Since the \"claims\" set forth the metes and bounds, or limits, of the\nexclusive privilege for which the patent was granted, an attorney, by scanning\nthe Official Gazette, may learn of recent patent grants in the fields with which\nhis clients are concerned, for the purpose both of keeping up to date and of\nlearning of possible conflict with the client's competitors.\nPatents are classified in the Official Gazette as general and mechanical\npatents, chemical patents, and electrical patents. Design patents, also granted\n9The United States Patent Quarterly (U.S.P.Q.) also contains Patent Office and court\ndecisions bearing upon patents, trademarks, copyrights, unfair competition, antitrust matters,\nand the like; and, as later discussed, federal court decisions on all subjects, including patents,\nare also contained in other reports\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nby the Patent Office for new and ornamental esthetic designs of various kinds\nof items, are also reported.\nIn addition, the Official Gazette publishes trademarks that the Patent Office\nproposes to register, to enable anyone who considers that such registration may\nhurt him to file an opposition to it. A trademark is a mark (such as a symbol\nor word or the like) that a party in business adopts and uses in connection with\nhis products or services. It serves to associate these products or services, in\nthe public mind, with the business entity that is the source or their origin -\n\"Ivory,\" for example, as used on soap by Procter and Gamble. Unlike a patent,\na common-law trademark is not obtained by registering it in the Patent Office,\nbut merely by adopting and using it. However, federal registration of a mark,\nused in interstate commerce, provides, among other benefits, certain procedural\nadvantages in enforcing the mark against infringers, and in obtaining trademark\nregistrations in certain foreign countries.\nI have dwelt briefly on this matter because there is today, in some quarters,\nrenewed interest in the proposal that the Patent Office similarly publish in its\nGazette, for opposition, its intention to grant patents. The theory is that if\nthe public can oppose the granting of a patent by calling to the attention of the\nexaminer some reasons why it should not be issued - such as a prior art that the\nexaminer may have overlooked - the courts should give more than lip service to\nthe present statutory presumption of the validity of a patent grant, discussed\nlater, because the public had its chance to disprove the allegation of invention\nbefore the patent was issued.\nIn Chapter 6, I shall analyze a series of proposals for remedial legislation,\nincluding the matter of oppositions, which, for reasons later presented, I now\nbelieve more likely to be detrimental than helpful to the American patent sys\ntem.\n2.6\nA Further Role of the Courts - Infringement Suits\nLet us assume that a patent has been granted by the Patent Office. This office\nthen loses jurisdiction of the patent, with a few minor exceptions. The next\ntribunal before which a patent may come is the federal District Court. How\ndoes this come about?\nSomebody starts to \"infringe\" the patent. This may mean that someone\nother than the owner or a licensee under the patent makes, uses, or sells (or\ninduces the making, using, or selling of) the invention in violation of the patent\nholder's right to exclude others from manufacturing, using, or selling it. (A\n\"licensee\" is one who has obtained, by suitable contract with the patent holder\nor one authorized to act for him, a license or right to manufacture, use, or\nsell the invention with the assurance that he shall be immune from suit by the\npatent holder.\nUsually some kind of license fee, often termed a royalty and\nfrequently based upon a percentage of the business involving the invention that\nthe licensee may do, is involved in the license contract.)\nWhen the patent holder learns about the action, he demands that the person\ninvolved cease and desist from his infringement and account for past infringe\n\nCreate or Perish\nment or, if the patent holder is prepared to grant him a license, negotiate such\na license.\nSuppose the infringer declines to stop infringing or to negotiate a license. The\npatent then serves, in the words of the late Professor George Washington Pierce\nof Harvard University, as \"a license to bring a law suit.\" The patent holder has\nthe legal right to file a complaint in the federal District Court where the infringer\nresides or where the infringer is both doing business and committing his acts\nof infringement, requesting the court to issue an injunction prohibiting further\ninfringement and to award damages to the patent holder for this unlicensed use\nof his invention.\nThe defendant-infringer must file an answer to the complaint, setting forth\nhis reasons for defying the plaintiff's patent rights. Usually, he will list earlier\nsimilar patents or publications and refer to earlier alleged inventors or users of\nthe invention covered by the patent, in the hope that, at the trial, he will be able\nto convince the court that no real advance had been made over what had been\ndone before, of sufficient scope to warrant a patent grant, and so the Patent\nOffice erred in issuing the patent. The defendant also usually offers reasons\nwhy his product, in view of certain differences in construction, should not be\nconsidered an infringement of the precise invention described and claimed in the\npatent. Other defenses may also be offered.\nI ought to mention, however, another important defense that is sometimes\nappropriate, namely, that the patent holder is misusing his patent in violation\nof our antitrust laws (including restraining or conspiring to restrain trade) 10 .\nHe may have required certain illegal restrictions, such as forcing the licensee to\npurchase unpatented items for him, a restriction outside the scope of the actual\nlegal right, privilege, or \"monopoly\" (using the latter term in a loose sense)\nafforded by the patent grant.\nThe defendant also customarily attacks the patent by way of a counterclaim,\nupon the same grounds used in defending a suit for infringement. He asks the\ncourt to issue a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid or otherwise\nunenforceable, or that the defendant's products are not infringements. In this\nway, should the plaintiff withdraw his suit, the defendant's counterclaim will\nstill be before the court for adjudication.\nThe complain, the answer, and the counterclaim are the customary docu\nments filed in the ordinary run-of-the-mill patent suit.\nBy the time the case comes to trial, the judge has usually required the\ndefendant to narrow down the list of allegedly prior art patents, publications,\nand uses that he is going to rely upon as anticipatory of the invention. At the\nsame time, the judge has required the plaintiff to state the dates of invention\nwhich he is trying to prove, and the particular claims on which he rests his case.\nThe judge then hears the case.\nThe plaintiff, usually with the aid of a\ntechnical expert, such as an engineer or scientist familiar with the field of the\ninvention, explains to the court what the patent covers, translating engineer\ning and technical terms and concepts into layman's language. He explains the\n10Such as the Clayton and Sherman Acts.\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nproblem that this invention is supposed to solve, and then offers evidence as\nto what the defendant is doing and why this constitutes infringement of the\npatent claims. The plaintiff then rests his case. Why? Because our law says\nthat a patent is presumed to be valid; that is, the process of examination in the\nPatent Office has given the patent an aura of being valid under the law. This\nmeans that the defendant has the burden of proving that the patent is not valid.\nAnd here the law, at least in theory, imposes upon the defendant a very heavy\nburden. The plaintiff has presented what is termed a prima-facie case, and it\nis incumbent upon the defendant to proceed with his proofs. However, in the\nevent that the defendant overcomes, by his evidence, the plaintiff's prima facie\ncase, the ultimate burden of proof of validity rests with the plaintiff.\nThe defendant may call his technical expert to the stand to explain the dis\nclosures of the prior patents or publications (and also prior uses) before referred\nto, trying to convince the judge that the invention was either previously dis\nclosed or publicly used, or that, contrary to the patent examiner's view, any\nindividual skilled in the art (as distinguished from an expert) would know how\nto make this invention. The plaintiff may, of course, cross-examine the defen\ndant's witnesses. When the defendant has completed his defense, the plaintiff\nhas an opportunity to rebut.\nThe judge must then make a decision.\nHe studies the subsequently filed\nbriefs of the parties and the transcript of the testimony, makes up his mind,\nand writes a decision. The federal rules of civil procedure require that he make\nspecific findings of fact and conclusions of law, with regard to the validity and\ninfringement of the patent. He must present his findings in writing.\nThese patent decisions and other decisions in all fields of the federal District\nCourts are reported in a series of volumes known as the Federal Supplement,\nwhich is abbreviated as \"F. Supp.,\" with the volume number as a prefix and\nthe page number as a suffix.\nThe trial judge's decision, however, is not final. He is but the first rung of\nan echelon. The losing party has a right to appeal from his decision to a Circuit\nCourt of Appeals. A circuit is a geographic area generally comprising a few\nstates. The First Circuit, for example, is composed of Massachusetts, Maine,\nNew Hampshire, Rhode Island, and the possession of Puerto Rico. The Court\nof Appeals for the First Circuit sits in Boston, and hears appeals from all of\nthe federal District Courts in its circuit. In all, there are ten circuits plus the\nDistrict of Columbia.\nThe Courts of Appeals customarily sit in panels of three judges, and review\nthe District Courts' decisions, sustaining the trial judges or reversing them, as\nthe case may be. The decisions of the Courts of Appeals are reported in the\nFederal Reporter, abbreviated \"F.,\" for a first series of volumes, and \"F. 2d\" for\nthe present second series.\nSitting above these Courts of Appeals is the Unites States Supreme Court.\nA party losing a patent appeal in a Court of Appeals does not have an absolute\nright to heard by the United States Supreme Court. Under Article III of the\nConstitution, the Supreme Court must, in theory, take certain kinds of cases,\nbut these do not include patent appeals.\nThe losing party must, according,\n\nCreate or Perish\npetition the Supreme Court by way of the before-mentioned petition for a writ\nof certiorari, asking the Court, in its discretion, to review the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals.\nThe Supreme Court grants very, very few such writs. It is more likely to\ngrant certiorari in a vitally important case involving large companies than in\nthe case of smaller companies, or individual litigants, even though the issues\nmay be the same.\nRecent past experience has been that when a Court of Appeals sustained\na patent, there was likelihood that the Supreme Court would grant certiorari,\nand then proceed to destroy the patent. Where a Court of Appeals has thrown\nout the patent, however, there is no case in modern times of which I am aware\nwhere the Supreme Court granted certiorari to reinstate it.\nThe decisions of the Supreme Court are reported in several different volumes,\none of which is the United States Reports, abbreviated as \"U.S.\" I shall, for\ninstance, later refer to the Bell Telephone Cases, which are reported at 126 U.S.\nAnyone desiring to find the decisions of trial and appellate courts, accord\ningly, may consult the Federal Supplement, Federal Reporter, and United States\ndecisions (or, in the case of patents and related fields, the United States Patent\nQuarterly), and he will find there exactly what reasons were advanced by the\nvarious courts for sustaining or destroying patents.\nWith the aid of these reported past decisions, a lawyer can try to instruct\nhis client as to the expression and application of the law by the courts, and so\nmap out a procedure to meet his client's situation.\n\nChapter 3\nThe Patent Law\nWhile the classes of patentable inventions and statutory restrictions\nare readily set forth, with illustrative cases, the question of what\nis \"obvious\" and what is \"invention\" under the 1952 Patent Act is\nunsettled . This chapter accordingly concludes with a discussion of\nthis vital question which the Supreme Court has thus far refused to\nhear. Here are presented the author's views based, in part, upon\nthe current very real role played in American innovation by the in\ndependent inventor.\nThere must, clearly, be a set of rules or norms by means of which to establish\nthe various kinds of invention (using that word in its popular sense for the\nmoment) that may be patentable or, at least, the circumstances under which\npublic policy requires that a patent may not be granted.\nAs noted earlier, Congress set forth, in the Patent Act of 1952, a codifica\ntion of our patent laws, restating the substance of prior statutes and adopting\nconstructive court-made law established prior to the 1930's. But, in addition,\nit introduced changes in the law primarily directed at curbing the damage to\nthe patent system effected by recent destructive policies of the Supreme Court.\nIncluded in these curbs are the abolition of the doctrine of \"flash of genius 1\"\nas the test for invention, later discussed, and the loose and ready invalidation\nof patent claims as defining the invention functionally, instead of structurally.\n3.1\nClasses of Patentable Invention\nThe 1952 Act was passed pursuant to the previously discussed Constitutional\nprovision in Article I, Section 8, empowering Congress to promote the progress of\nuseful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their\ndiscoveries. Two words are used here: \"inventors\" and \"discoveries.\" While\ninvention and discovery may involve different concepts to the linguist, in patent\nlaw, they had previously meant the same thing and been used synonymously.\nThe first provision of the 1952 Act, Section 100, thus sets forth that \"the term\n1Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., 214 U.S. 84, 91 (1941)\n\nCreate or Perish\n'invention' means invention or discovery.\" As explained before, the word \"dis\ncovery\" does not include the bald discovery of a scientific principle, and the\ndefinition in Section 100 appears to limit the word to mean only \"invention,\"\nas that term had been used in prior court decisions.\nThe statute then proceeds to define various classes of invention - listing a\nprocess, a machine, a manufacture, a composition of matter, or a material. Some\nof these words are a little bit out-of-date today, but they came from the very\nearly patent acts when the only appropriate term to describe an invention was a\n\"machine\" or a \"manufacture.\" In our modern vernacular, a \"machine\" is hardly\ndescriptive of an electronic component or circuit; but the courts, following the\nlead of prior Supreme Courts and the actual desires and intentions of Congress,\ncontinue to use this older language of the statutes. Thus, a piece of apparatus\nthat achieves a useful result functionally is a \"machine,\" and an item that can\nbe produced or manufactured by a machine is an article \"manufacture.\" As an\nillustration, apparatus for weaving cloth is a \"machine;\" the cloth, when woven,\nis a \"manufacture.\"\nThe term \"composition of matter\" is self-explanatory. If someone invents a\nnew chemical compound, that compound may be patentable. If someone else\nmerely discovers a chemical compound or element existing in nature, that is not\npatentable. Thus a claim to an electric lamp filament wire formed of ductile\ntungsten was invalidated 2 . The General Electric Company inventor, W. D.\nCoolidge, had made an important advance in a ductile-tungsten filament for\nlamps. He had accomplished this by removing impurities from tungsten as found\nin nature; but removing impurities from natural tungsten to make it ductile\nresulted only in pure tungsten, which is inherently ductile. Pure tungsten, of\ncourse, is a natural element, even if it never found pure in nature. It is interesting\nto note that the judge who invalidated this patent (Judge Morris of the District\nCourt for the District of Delaware) had himself previously sustained the patent.\nHe had not then, however, been presented with the argument that the patent\ncovered merely an element of nature in its pure state; but when so informed,\nreasoned that it could not be the subject of a \"monopoly,\" even though never\nfound pure in nature. An element is not included in the statutory classes of\ninvention.\n\"Material\" is a new word in the statute and may have a meaning very similar\nto that of \"manufacture,\" though a \"material\" may be produced by a process\nthat would not, in conventional language, necessarily be termed \"manufactur\ning.\"\n\"Process\" is defined, in part, as a \"process, art, or method.\"\nIt usually\nembraces a series of steps for accomplishing or producing a certain result. A\nchemical process is, of course, quite easy to comprehend. The next chapter,\nwhich discusses the Bell Telephone Cases, will show that there may also be an\nelectrical process.\nSuppose someone arranges the various parts of an old machine in a novel\nmanner to perform a new operation. Is this a process or method? A case of this\n2General Electric Co. v DeForest Radio Co., 28 F 2d 641.\n\nThe Patent Law\nsort came before the United States Supreme Court in connection with adjusting\nan existing metal-perforating machine so that, instead of merely perforating\nthe metal, the dies lifted the perforations out and twisted them to enlarge the\nperforations, thereby making an expanded metal sheet 3 . The defendant argued\nthat this was not within the patentable classes of invention since the original\n\"machine\" with its dies was old and thus was not patentable, and, additionally,\nthe ultimate \"manufacture\" - the expanded metal - was an old article. By this\nreasoning the inventor had not produced a new machine, a new manufacture,\nor, obviously, a new composition of matter. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court\nheld that this invention involved a new process, although, on several occasions,\nthat Court had previously intimated, by dicta, that there could not be a novel\npatentable process or method unless it involved chemical, electrical, or other\n\"elemental\" phenomena. This case, however, decided that a patentable process,\nart, or method could also involve mechanical manipulative steps: it could be a\nnew way of operating an old machine to obtain new results.\nIn addition to the definition of the term \"process\" as meaning \"process, art,\nor method,\" the Patent Act of 1952 also provides that \"process\" shall include\nA new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition\nof matter, or material.\nTo appreciate the significance of this definition, let us recall the case of Dr.\nWilliam Morton, a Boston dentist, who is credited, in some quarters, with hav\ning been the first to make the discovery, and the use of ether was immediately\nadopted. The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary and a number of other hospi\ntals, indeed, freely infringed upon Dr. Morton's patent. Suit was entered which\nfreely infringed upon Dr. Morton's patent. Suit was entered for infringement 4 ,\nand the court found that Dr. Morton \"was entitled to be classified among the\ngreatest benefactors of mankind.\" But, the court questioned, was the claimed\ninvention a new process? No, there was no new series of steps involved. Re\nsearchers had previously inhaled ether. (Question: Had they previously inhaled\nit to the extent taught by Morton to produce the new effect of anesthesia?) Dr.\nMorton was claiming the use of ether for the purpose of anesthetization. That\nis not, said the court, a new \"art\" or \"process.\" Was it a new composition of\nmatter? Ether had been discovered before. Was it a new machine? No. Was it a\nnew manufacture? No. The court concluded, therefore, that this epoch-making\ndiscovery was not one included in the limited classes that Congress defined as\namong those patentable. So Dr. Morton's patent was thrown out.\nA discovery may be brilliant and useful, and not patentable. . . . Something\nmore is necessary. The new force or principle brought to light must\nbe embodied and set to work, and can be patented only in connection\nor combination with the means by which, or the medium through\nwhich it operates.\n3Expanded Metal Co. v. Bradford. 214 U.S. 366 (1909).\n4Morton v. New York Eye Infirmary, 17 Fed. Cas. 879, 5 Blatchf. 116 (1862)\n\nCreate or Perish\nTo cite another illustration: the citrus fruit industry had long been troubled\nwith a blue mold that formed upon citrus fruit shipped from the South.\nIt\nwas discovered that if oranges were coated with a solution of borax, specks or\ncuts in the fruit became thoroughly covered over and no formation of the mold\nwould take place. A patent was applied for and obtained by the Brogdex Co.\ncovering the product and the process for making it. It was claimed that fresh\ncitrus fruit of which the rind of skin carried borax in a very small amount is\nrendered resistant to blue mold. The American Fruit Growers infringed this\npatent and Brogdex brought suit. The district court and the court of appeals\nheld the patent valid and infringed. The Supreme Court, however, held that this\ninvention was neither a machine nor a composition of matter 5 . It was also not\nan article of manufacture, because there was no change in form or appearance of\nthe fruit (much as Coolidge still only produced tungsten). In other words, it did\nnot belong to any of the patentable classes and could not, therefore, be protected\nby patent. As for claiming the discovery in method form, the Supreme Court\nheld that the use of borax had been known before, not for filling up small specks\nto prevent blue mold, but for preserving fruit, and the method of applying the\nborax was the same as used here (much as Dr. Morton's method of applying\nether to the nostrils was allegedly old). One could not the obtain a patent for\na new use of an old method.\nLet us assume, by way of contrast, that in the process of treating the orange\nwith borax some chemical reaction took place so that the orange was no longer\nan orange, and the borax was no longer borax. We would then have a new\ncomposition of matter - neither orange nor borax. Would this be patentable?\nA similar case occurred where it had been found that, in dyeing fur to preserve\nit, a chemical reaction took place which actually made a new preserved fiber out\nof the natural hair. It no longer had the characteristics of the natural fur. It\nno longer had the characteristics of the natural fur. Under these circumstances,\nsaid the circuit court of appeals 6, the invention was a new article of manufacture\nand hence within the patentable classes of invention.\nOne can see, accordingly, that there is room for great latitude and inge\nnuity of argument in trying to construe a discovery as being within one of the\npatentable classes. A hostile court will not permit the law to grow with scientific\ndiscovery, whereas a court with a zeal to protect property rights in discoveries\n(under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution) can offer great encouragement\nto the promotion of progress in the useful arts.\nWe can all probably understand why Congress has not seen fit to permit\npatents to be granted for mere scientific discoveries. Something is wrong, how\never, if a practical application of such a discovery cannot be construed as being\nwithin the patentable classes of invention set forth by the Congress for that very\npurpose. Dr. Morton, for example, did not try to patent ether all over again;\nhe tried to patent its use for a particular new result. Should not that take it\nout of the category of pure scientific discovery? Congress, the engineering, sci\n5American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co., 283 U.S. 1.\n6Steinfur Patents Corp. v. William Beyer, Inc., 62 F 2d 238.\n\nThe Patent Law\nentific, and business people, and the lawyers who were responsible for the 1952\nPatent Act appear to have answered this question in the affirmative by defin\ning \"process\" to include \"a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or material.\" While the paucity of court decisions makes\nit too early to form an opinion as to the ultimate effect of this new definition,\nthe Board of Appeals of the Patent Office has already construed it to mean that\nthe new use must be one not analogous to, but radically different from, the kind\nbefore involved, and that the patent claim must be couched in the form of a\nprocess or method and not of an apparatus.\n3.2\nConditions of Patentability\nTurning, now, to the definition in the statute of patentable invention, we find\nthat Section 101 is limited to \"Whoever invents or discovers.\"\nThis means\nan individual or individuals, since a corporate body or other organizational\nentity cannot itself invent or discover. The individuals who do this creating and\nthis inventing may, however, assign their patent rights or a portion thereof, in\nwriting, to a corporation or to the government, so that a patent or a part thereof\nmay actually be owned by others than the inventor. But the application must\nbe filed in the name of the first inventor or inventors. The language provides\nthat, in this country, a patent can be issued only to the first inventor. In Great\nBritain, patents were and are granted to anyone who brings a new invention\ninto the country. The British philosophy encourages the importation as well as\ninvention of new techniques. Not so in this country, however, for if a patent\nshould be granted to someone other than a first inventor, it will be thrown out\nby the court as invalid.\nContinuing with Section 101, the inventor must invent or discover a \"new and\nuseful\" invention. The matter of the requirement for novelty has previously been\ndiscussed. As for the word \"useful,\" nearly everything has been held to be useful.\nAmong the exceptions are devices for promoting fraud or that are injurious to\nthe public health or against public policy. A \"perpetual-motion\" machine or\nany other inoperative proposal lacks utility. There are then set forth the before\nmentioned five classes of patentable invention: \"process, machine, manufacture,\nor composition of matter\" or \"material\"; and, in addition, \"any new and useful\nimprovement thereof.\" Not everyone can make a basic invention, but the law\nentitles one to seek a patent for an improvement in a machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or process.\nSection 101 also states that one may obtain a patent in the above classes,\nsubject to the requirements given in Section 102, which sets out the \"Condi\ntions for patentability, novelty and loss of right to patent.\" The Congress has\npositively declared that \"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless. . . .\" This\nappears to have been an effort (not yet successful) to curb the indiscriminate\ninvalidation of patents.\nThe first restriction is that a patent cannot be granted if the invention was\nknown or used by others in this country or patented or described in a printed\npublication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the\n\nCreate or Perish\napplicant for a patent (Section 102 [a]).\nThe inventor does not have to be\nactually aware of such prior knowledge, use, publication, or patenting, for, if\nthe invention was \"described in a printed publication\" or a prior patent was\nissued anywhere at all before he made his invention there would be an absolute\nbar to granting him a patent.\nEven if the prior patentee did not claim the\nsame inventive features, but merely \"described\" the invention adequately in a\npatent issued prior to the present inventor's concept, this description becomes\na statutory bar. This restriction demonstrates the importance of patent and\nliterature searches of both United States and foreign patents and publications\nbefore filing a patent application.\nAs for the phrase \"known or used by others in this country,\" a little history\nis in order. This was not always the law. The early patent statutes set up as\na bar to patentability knowledge or use anywhere in the world. Realizing the\nimportance of encouraging the utilization of new concepts in this country, how\never, Congress revised this to cover only prior knowledge or use in this country\n- a sore point in our current relations with foreign countries. If the invention\nwas known or used abroad but was not patented or described in a printed pub\nlication before the invention was made here, no bar exists to obtaining a patent\nin this country, provided that the inventor did not know of this knowledge or\nuse abroad. Of course, if he did know, he did not make the invention.\nThe courts have interpreted the word \"known,\" moreover, in a very strict\nsense to mean that \"an invention . . . has been completed by reduction to prac\ntice 7.\" The invention is not \"known\" if it is a prior \"conception only\" (such as\na laboratory notebook drawing or disclosure, or an unpublished manuscript), or\nif \"prior machines\" have not \"been working machines\" but \"mere experiments.\"\nEven the knowledge by individuals in this country, prior to an inventor's inven\ntion here, that a certain device had been previously used abroad successfully, is\nnot with the statutory term \"known 8.\"\nThe term \"used\" is similarly the subject matter of much court construction.\nBriefly, it means a public use 9 and not an experimental or secret use, and does\nnot include mere conceptions or abandoned experiments, such as those made\nin company laboratories or in institutions of learning and not followed up by\npublication, reduction to practice, actual public use, or patenting.\nAll of this has to do with knowledge, use, patenting, or publishing (Section\n102 [a]) before one makes an invention. There is also a time limitation. If an\napplicant waits too long, even though there is no prohibition under Section 102\n(a), he may be out of luck in view of the restriction of Section 102 (b), which\nprovides that a person shall be entitled to a patent.\nunless the invention was patented or described in a printed publica\ntion in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this\ncountry, more than one year prior to the date of the application for\n7Application of Schittler, CCPA, 234 F 2d 882, 887.\n8Doyle v. Spaulding, C.C. 19 F. 744; Westinghouse Machine Co. v. General Electric Co.,\n2 Cir., 207 F. 75, City of Milwaukee v. Activated Sludge, Inc., 7 Cir., 69 F. 2d 577.\n9Paddies, Inc. v. Broadway Dept. Stores, 147 F. Supp 373.\n\nThe Patent Law\npatent in the United States.\nEven though he may be qualified under Section 102 (a), therefore, if he does\nnot file the patent application until more than a year after publishing a thesis\nor scientific paper on the invention, he is too late to obtain a patent. If, before\nfiling, he waits more than a year after someone else has described his invention\nin a publication, again it is too late to obtain a patent. And the same is true\nif he files more than a year after his invention first went into public use or was\nput on sale.\nIn some foreign countries, it is too late to file for a patent after any docu\nment describing the invention has been made public in the country in question;\nthis is the case, for example, in Great Britain. In Germany, a description of\nthe invention in public print in any language or country, before the German\napplication is filed, bars a German patent. It is not entirely safe, therefore, to\ndelay filing until after publication to obtain foreign patent protection.\nThe last-named restrictions of Section 102 (b) in connection with \"public\nuse\" or \"sale\" are very important to the applied scientist or engineer. His new\nproducts are always going out for tests, for sale, for use; and the question arises\nas to when he should file a patent application. Perhaps one of those fundamental\ncases that partially answered this question arose in Boston in the late nineteenth\ncentury in connection with the invention of wooden paving blocks. The patent\nwas not applied for until several years after these blocks had been in use in a toll\nroad. The defendant infringed that patent, contending that it was invalid since\nthe blocks had been in public use on the street more than two years before the\ninventor had filed his patent application. (At that time, the statute provided for\ntwo years of public use instead of one year, as at present.) The Supreme Court\nfound 10 that there was no way of proving the efficacy of this invention except\nby actual test on a street, and the circumstances showed that the inventor was\nmerely trying to test whether or not the invention was any good. The Court,\naccordingly, construed this, not as a \"public use,\" but rather as an experimental\none.\nAlong came the case of a gentleman who invented steel stays for women's\ncorsets, in place of whalebone as before. He gave a sample to a lady friend\nto try out, and she used it for several years. Then the inventor filed for his\npatent. When the case reached the court, the defendant set up as a \"public\nuse\" argument the the fact that this corset had been worn for more than two\nyears before the inventor filed his patent application. The inventor, on the other\nhand, argued according to the rule of the paving-block cased before mentioned.\nThe court thereupon laid down a second important rule 11, namely, that even a\nsingle use by a member of the public, except under such restrictions or conditions\nas would clearly delineate experimental or confidential use, constitutes a bar to\nthe granting of a patent, unless the application is filed within the statutory\nperiod. And this very rigid rule had been discovered by several companies, with\nimportant patents, much to their sorrow.\n10Elizabeth v. Pavement Co., 1877, 97 U.S. 126, 134-135.\n11Egbert v. Lippman, 104 U.S. 333.\n\nCreate or Perish\nIn a recent case 12, suit was brought for infringement of a patent dealing\nwith a process for casting patterned plastic sheets. The defendant showed that\nmore than a year before the application for patent the plaintiffhad sold several\nhundred plastic sheets made by the patented process. Thereupon, the plaintiff\ninsisted that this use of the patent and sale of the product created by its process\nwere merely experimental to determine the \"production controls\" necessary for\nthe successful commercial exploitation of the patent; but the court held that\nthis constitutes a \"prior use\" within the meaning of the statute.\nThis decision points out significantly the importance of filing a patent ap\nplication not only for the new article, but also for the process involved in the\nmanufacture of the article, within a year after the first sale. The safest proce\ndure is to file before the public obtains the article, and even before it is put on\nsale. The term \"sale,\" moreover, has been interpreted by the courts to include\nan offer for sale. Thus the matter of patent protection, both for the article and\nfor the method of making it, should be very carefully explored well within the\nyear after any offer to sell or any public use.\nReturning to the restrictions in Section 102, we see that part (c) bars a patent\nif the inventor has abandoned his invention. Even if one has produced and tested\nan invention, so as to establish its so-called reduction to practice, but has put\nit away on a shelf and forgotten it, and in the meantime it is independently\ninvented by another person, he cannot prevail as the first inventor against the\nsecond person. Abandonment does not promote the useful arts, and accordingly\nit is not in accordance with our public policy to reward such inactivity. It is\nvery important, therefore, to realize that one cannot put ideas away and forget\nabout them, and then hope to resurrect early dates for them at a later time.\nThose early dates not utilized are of no avail against the diligence of others.\nSection 102 (d) relates to the effect of foreign patent filing. One must file\na separate patent application in each country in which one wishes the inven\ntion protected, though it now appears likely that a single European Economic\nCommunity patent may be established within a very few years, as discussed in\nChapter 7. Under the Universal Copyright Convention 13, a copyright regis\ntration in one country serves also as one in the other foreign countries which\nare members of the convention. Patents, on the other hand, must be obtained\nthrough the individual patent offices of the respective countries. Section 102\n(d) provides that, if one has filed in a foreign country more than twelve months\nbefore filing in this country, and if the patent issues abroad before the filing of\nthe United States application, he is barred from obtaining a patent here.\nThis goes hand in hand, however, with a provision of a different convention\n14, by which one may file abroad in any foreign country that is a member of\n12U.S. Chemical Corporation v. Plastic Glass Corporation, 3 Cir., 243 F. 2d 892 (1957).\n13The United States is a signatory to this 1952 Convention, implemented into our law by\nPublic Law 742, 83d Congress, effective September 16, 1955.\n14Convention of Paris for the Protection of Industrial Property of March 20, 1883, as\namended December 14, 1900 (Brussels); June 2, 1911 (Washington, D.C.); November 6, 1925\n(The Hague); June 2, 1934 (London). A further conference at Lisbon, October 6 - 31, 1958\nresulted in further amendments.\n\nThe Patent Law\nthis other convention, and thereby obtain the effective benefit of the earlier\nfiling date in the United States, provided the foreign filing is done within twelve\nmonths of the United States filing date. Similarly, foreigners may file here with\nreciprocal privileges. There is thus a year's leeway in which to decide whether\nor not to file abroad; and foreign applications claiming the convention benefits,\nif filed with that year, will be treated as if they had been filed simultaneously\nwith the United States application.\nThe United States Government, however, does not permit its citizens to file\nabroad as an absolute right. This is because of national-defense statutes. The\npatent application filed in the Patent Office is examined by Army, Air Force,\nAEC, and other personnel, assisting the commissioner of patents, to see whether\nit contains information which might jeopardize the security of the country. If\nthe answer is in the affirmative, the commissioner will issue a secrecy order,\nprohibiting any filing abroad before obtaining a license from the government to\ndo so. If, under those circumstances, one still wishes to file abroad, he may\npetition the commissioner, offering reasons why secrecy should not be required\nin the particular case. The commissioner will take up the matter with the branch\nof the service which, in the first place, considered that the invention involved\nclassified material and then a decision will be reached as to whether or not to\npermit filing abroad, and in what countries. If, however, after one has filed an\napplication, he does not hear within six months from the Patent Office that\nthe case has been put under secrecy orders, he automatically obtains a license\nto file abroad, except that special permission may be required for Iron Curtain\ncountries.\nSection 102 (e) provides that if an invention has been described in a patent\ngranted to another on an application filed before one has himself independently\nmade the same invention, there is a bar to his obtaining a patent in this country.\nIf the prior patent claims the invention, and if the independent inventor made\nhis invention before the filing date of the application for the prior patent, then\nhe may ask the Patent Office to declare an interference contest between himself\nand the other patentee. In this way, he may have the right to take inter partes\ntestimony for a determination as to who is really the first inventor. If the patent\ndiscloses, but does not claim the invention, however, and again, the independent\ninventor made the invention before the filing date of the application for the prior\npatent, the independent inventor may present ex parte evidence, by means of\naffidavit 15, to demonstrate his earlier date of invention, and thus remove the\nother patent as a bar to the granting of his.\nSection 102 (f) deals with the necessity, previously discussed, for the appli\ncant to be the first inventor.\n3.3\nInterference\nSection 102 (g) provides for interference contests mentioned above to determine\npriority of invention where more than one person is claiming to be the original\ninventor. The statute describes the court-established rule that the first applicant\n15Patent Office Rule of Practice No. 131\n\nCreate or Perish\nto file is not necessarily, in law, the first inventor. The inventor is the first to\nreduce it to practice, but there is one exception to this rule. If, though the last\nto reduce it to practice, he was the first to conceive, and was diligently working\nat it when his rival entered the field and continued to do so until his reduction\nto practice, then he is the first inventor.\nPerhaps a few definitions of interference terminology may be helpful. Con\nception involves obtaining the complete mental picture of the invention, even\ntough one has not yet built it. If one is to rely upon a drawing or a notebook\ndisclosure or the like to prove conception, he must show that all of the elements\nof the claimed invention in controversy are present or implied therein.\nThe\nkeeping of full notes is thus greatly to be desired. Reduction to practice of the\ninvention means either building and successfully testing the invention (though\nthere are some exceptions to this necessity in the case of very simple devices)\nor filing a patent application for a theoretically operative model. Building and\nsuccessful testing is termed \"actual\" reduction to practice, filing a patent appli\ncation may constitute a \"constructive\" reduction to practice. Corroboration by\na qualified witness to the inventor's tests is important, since the courts, in order\nto avoid possible fraud, require such independent corroboration of the inventor's\ntestimony before accepting the latter's alleged dates.\nMany times, however, particularly if an individual with neither money nor\ntime with which to build and test an invention is satisfied with the theoretical\noperativeness of the invention, he may protect his rights by filing a patent\napplication, and thus obtain a constructive reduction to practice. The United\nStates Government currently takes the position, in contracts granted to develop\nor adapt inventions, that, no matter how much money one may have spent in\ndeveloping a conception or in reducing it to practice by filing patent applications\nand the like, if government money in substantial amounts is appropriated to\nbuild the invention for the first time under the contract, the government must\nbe granted a free license, with no strings attached 16 . The government may then,\nwith impunity, give to others than the inventors and developers the business of\nbuilding the invention commercially for it.\nAs a former member of a bar-association committee on government patent\npolicies, I can state that, unfortunately, many lawyers are apathetic in this\nmatter, which puts a particularly onerous burden on the small company. It is\nthe government, however, that suffers in the long run when individual inventors\nand their companies are discouraged from suggesting the creative flashes from\nwhich have sprung the seeds, not only of our weapons of defense and offense,\nbut also of our economic expansion and development.\n3.4\nThe Statutory Test of Invention\nThe court-made law relating to the requirement for the exercise of a \"flash of\ncreative genius,\" in order to support a patent, laid down by Mr. Justice Douglas\n16The Armed Services Procurement Regulations provide an exception in cases where the\nGovernment funds are relatively small and in other similar circumstances.\n\nThe Patent Law\n17, was overthrown by Congress in the last sentence of Section 103 of the Patent\nAct of 1952:\nPatentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the\ninvention was made.\nIt has been superseded by another and entirely different test which assumes\nthat the requirements of Section 102 have been met. It reads:\nA patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically\ndisclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if\nthe differences between the subject matter sought to be patented\nand the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would\nhave been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person\nhaving ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\nPatentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the\ninvention was made.\nThe Supreme Court has, as yet, declined every opportunity offered it to\ninterpret this statutory provision of the ultimate test of whether an improvement\nis or is not sufficiently significant to warrant a patent grant. Since this question\nis the most pressing to every inventor, engineer, or other party concerned with\ninventions, a discussion of the history of this legislation and at least certain\nlower-court views with regard to it may be helpful.\nA \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter per\ntains\" has been the standard set up ever since at least 1850 18 . Unfortunately,\nhowever, that standard has not always been met, but has varied with the differ\nent courts. When one court was desirous of sustaining a patent, one standard\nwas set up. When another court desired to invalidate a patent, the standard\nwas quite different. Matters reached such a state that, as before mentioned, the\nstandard became no longer a \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which\nsaid subject matter pertains\" but rather one inspired by \"the flash of creative\ngenius.\"\nThis \"flash-of-creative-genius\" standard has raised a storm of protest through\nout the country, since in practice it is almost impossible to attain. Such a yard\nstick would have invalidated many of our most important patents, including Eli\nWhitney's cotton gin, McCormick's reaper, the sewing machine, the air brake,\nthe telegraph, the telephone, and the electric lamp. Such invalidation, of course,\nwould have discouraged invention.\nWhether or not this result would have pleased a minority of justices of\nthe Supreme Court, it certainly did not please Congress.\nAnd the reaction\nof Congress, moreover, did not arise out of any solicitude for our large corpora\ntions:\n17Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., U.S. 84, 91 (1941).\n18Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248, 267 (1850).\n\nCreate or Perish\nRather, through the operation of the patent system the small com\npany and the newcomer has been able to gain a foothold without\nbeing subject to appropriation of developments by the larger en\ntrenched firms. Polaroid, Thiokol, Mallory, and many others, rep\nresent small and modest sized businesses which have launched new\nproducts against the competition of an existing industry . . . It should\nnot be assumed that every time an excuse is found to invalidate a\npatent, competition necessarily benefits 19 .\nEven so, Congress had no desire to change the law, but rather to lower the\n\"flash-of-creative-genius\" standard to the level of the \"person having ordinary\nskill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\" Congress itself said so,\nin the Reviser's Note to Section 103:\nThis paragraph is added with the view that an explicit statement in\nthe statute may have some stabilizing effect. . .\nIt is of interest to observe, therefore, that the late Judge Learned Hand\nheld 20 that Section 103 does not actually constitute new legislation, but rather\nrestores the law to what it was \"twenty or thirty years ago\" before the courts\nbegan to adopt the standard of \"the flash of creative genius.\" Some courts have\nfollowed Judge Hand's decisions; others have not.\nCongress seemed convinced that only by such a restoring of the law would\nthe confidence of inventors be re-established and the progress of the useful arts\npromoted. Therefore, it is again studying the problem with the object of en\nacting further legislation.\nA subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary has been hearing testimony and collecting evidence for some years.\nSeveral reports by that subcommittee have expressed dissatisfaction with the\nlarge number of patents still being invalidated by the courts.\nIt may be well here to state that Section 103 had its origin in this very\ndissatisfaction. In the report of the National Patent Planning Commission, 1943,\nheaded by the late Charles F. Kettering, for example, appears the following:\nThe most serious weakness in the present patent system is the lack\nof a uniform test or standard for determining whether the particular\ncontribution of an inventor merits the award of the patent grant.\nThere is an ever-widening gulf between the decisions of the Patent\nOffice in granting patents and decisions of the courts who pass upon\ntheir validity. It would be highly desirable and a great step forward\nif patents could be issued with a greater assurance that their validity\nwould be upheld by the courts. No other feature of our law is more\ndestructive to the purpose of the patent system than this existing\nuncertainty as to the validity of a patent.\n19George E.

Bauch & Lomb Optical Co., 2 Cir., 224 F. 2d 530 (1955), certiorari denied 350\nU.S. 911, 955.\n\nThe Patent Law\n3.5\nObviousness of \"Subject Matter as a Whole\"\nThe restriction that an invention is not patentable if it is obvious as a whole, and\nnot merely in part, has been in force at least back to Supreme Court decisions\nin the late 1800's 21 .\nThe Century Dictionary gives the following definition of \"obvious\": \"easily\ndiscovered, seen, or understood; plain; manifest; evident; palpable.\" The way\nto determine whether an invention is obvious, accordingly, is by evidence.\nIn patent-infringement suit after patent-infringement suit, the plaintiff has\noffered evidence to show that he was the first to have offered a sought-after\nsolution to an existing problem and that, after disclosure of his solution, the\ndefendant appropriated it. The courts, in sanctioning this appropriation, have\nrarely disagreed with the plaintiffin his showing, but have thrown out his patent\nas involving merely an \"obvious\" step or device.\nBut such reasoning raises\nquestions.\nIf the solution of the problem disclosed by the inventor was obvious, why\ndid not the defendant adopt it earlier? Why did he wait until the invention was\nplaced upon the market by the plaintiff? If the prior-art developments constitute\nsatisfactory solutions of the given problem, as every defendant argues, why do\nnot the defendant use that prior art, instead of spending money in litigation in\norder to obtain the right to use the plaintiff's invention? If, on the other hand,\nthe prior art is not satisfactory, can it really be contended that the plaintiffhas\naccomplished no more in his device than, \"as a whole,' was obvious in the prior\nart?\nBut in case after case the courts have insisted in holding the invention \"obvi\nous\" in the light of hindsight in prior-art knowledge, in the face of indisputable\nshowings that there was no \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which\nsaid subject matter pertains\" to whom the invention was as that time \"obvious.\"\nRecently, a court of appeals sustained a district court's holding 22 that \"I am\nnot so troubled\" about \"Monday-morning-quarterbacking\" as more \"sensitive\njudges\" would have been; \"it does not seem to me to require inventive genius\"\nto make the plaintiff's invention; \"I am unable to perceive invention.\"\nIn an earlier day, a district court judge similarly remarked 23 . \"I am satisfied\nthat is amounts to nothing more than . . . I am unable to see how . . . \"; and the\ncourt of appeals reversed the decision, holding that these statements were not\nfindings of fact, but merely expressions of opinion, with \"no testimony in the\nrecord to support it.\"\nThe statute in Section 103, however, makes it plain that the question to be\ndecided by the court is not what may seem obvious after the event to lay courts\nor even technical experts, but, rather what\n21Bates v. Coe, 98 U.S. 31, 48 (1878), Imhauser v. Buerk, 101 U.S. 647, 660 (1879), Parks\nv. Booth, 102 U.S. 96 (1880).\n22Glagovsky v. Bowcraft, 164 F.

Supp. 321, 322, reversed 3 Cir. 67 F. 2d 190, 194\n(1933).\nThough the Supreme Court reversed at 292 U.S. 332 (293 U.S. 628), it was only\nbecause of a defect in appellate procedure.\n\nCreate or Perish\nwould have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a\nperson having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter\npertains.\nThis opinion has been reiterated recently by the Court of Customs and\nPatent Appeals 24:\nWhat amounts to patentable \"invention\" . . . is simply whether the\ndifference between what is claimed and the prior art would have been\nobvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention\nwas made.\nCertainly this does not mean whether the invention may seem obvious to\nthe court through hindsight.\nThe views of the late Judge Parker 25, of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit, may be of interest:\nThe state of the prior art, the problem to which the invention was\naddressed, its success in solving the problem, its acceptance by the\nart, and its success commercially should be accorded more weight\nthan what the judge, who is unfamiliar with the art or with the\nproblems of industry generally, may chance to think, in the light of\nthe problem's solution, as to what one skilled in the art should have\nknown or should have been able to do.\nHe went on:\nAnd especially should the judge be on guard against permitting an\nticipation to be found in the bone yard of abandoned experiments\nand mere paper patents. In such case the searching and conclusive\ninquiry is: \"If what has caused such a great change in the art and\nsuch an improvement in the industry was old and ready at hand,\nwhy did not it occur to someone else to use it?\"\nAs one court of appeals 26 remarked:\nIt is usually, if not indeed always, easy to discover a genesis some\nwhere for any patentee's contribution. But if patents were to be held\ninvalid on such reasoning, few would survive.\nAn invention, moreover, is always \"simple\" and \"obvious\" after it has been\ndisclosed. The Supreme Court of an earlier era said 27:\n24Application of Ruff and Dukeshire, CCPA, 256 F. 2d 590, 598 (1958).\n25\"Recurrence of Fundamentals,\" in American Bar Association Journal, Vol. 30, p. 623\n(1944).\n26S.D.

Now that it has succeeded, it may seem\nvery plain to any one that he could have done it as well. This is\noften the case with inventions of the greatest merit. It may be laid\ndown as a general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that\nif a new combination and arrangement of known elements produce\na new and beneficial result, never attained before, it is evidence of\ninvention.\nThe invention of the patent in suit in the Barbed Wire Patent case 28 lay in\nwrapping the barb several times around the carrier wire, so that a bearing was\nprovided for the barb, which was thus held permanently at right angles to the\ncarrier wire. The prior art disclosed the same barb, but without the bearing,\nso that it wobbled about the carrier wire instead of being held rigidly at right\nangles.\nThe Supreme Court remarked that \"it may be strange\" that this simple\ndevice was not \"obvious.\" Yet, \"simple\" and \"obvious\" as this improvement\nappeared in retrospect, it laid a foundation for accomplishing something that\nthe prior art could not do. By the new barbed-wired invention, cattle could be\nkept within their wired enclosures.\nA short time later 29, in sustaining a patent, the Supreme Court spoke of\nan invention that \"appears to the ordinary mind so simple as to excite wonder\nthat it was not thought of before.\" And, still later 30:\nIts simplicity should not blind us as to its character. Many things,\nand the patent laws abounds in illustrations, seem obvious after they\nhave been done. . . . Knowledge after the event is always easy, and\nproblems once solved present no difficulties.\nThe invention involved in the Eibel Process case 31, in retrospect, was again\n\"simple\" and \"obvious.\" It merely raised slightly the rear end of the belt of the\nFourdrinier papermaking machine, in order the the liquid pulp traveling thereon\ncould move a little faster, by gravity. Small as the advance was, however, it was\npromptly adopted by the industry.\nAgain, the invention in the Ray-O-Vac case of the early 1940's 32 was \"a\nvery narrow one in a crowded art.\" It consisted of enclosing a flashlight battery\nin a steel casing to render it leakproof. But this idea had never occurred (and\nhence manifestly was not obvious) to those persons (other than the inventor)\n\"having ordinary skill in the art\" who had long been troubled with the battery\nleakage.\n28143 U.S. 275, 283 (1892).\n29Potts v.

The burden of establishing inva\nlidity of a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.\nThe Supreme Court had previously held 33 that \"the burden of proof to make\ngood this defense\" is \"upon the party setting it up,\" and \"every reasonable doubt\nshould be resolved against him.\"\nBut the courts of the mid-twentieth century have paid little attention to this\npresumption. As Judge Galston has said 34 ,\nin the last two decades, though courts had said prior thereto that\npatents were entitled to a presumption of validity, during the latter\nyears only lip service has been given to that doctrine. Now it becomes\nclear that since there is a statutory presumption, it may not be\nignored.\nThis policy followed the dissent in the early 1940's of Mr. Justice Black 35:\nIn the absence of a statutory prescription to the contrary, I see no\nreason for extending the presumption of validity arising from the\nmere issuance of a patent. . . .\nSection 282 of the Patent Act of 1952 now provides that \"statutory prescrip\ntion.\" The presumption is greatly increased, moreover, when the art cited by\na defendant in an infringement suit is substantially the same as the art before\nthe examiner in the Patent Office.\nIf it were not for prejudices in the field of patents, the trend of decisions in\nthe administrative law field would seem to indicate that there should be, though\nthere is not, a steadily growing tendency to follow the proposal of an earlier\ncourt of appeals 36 in giving special weight to the use of skilled examiners in\nthe Patent Office in determining patentability.

Muther, 1 Cir., 288, 287 (1923).\n\nThe Patent Law\n3.7\nCommentary-The Case for Sympathetic Legal Recognition of Inventions\nThere is certainly a feeling in some judicial quarters that patents should not be\ngranted for \"gadgets\" or trivial devices, as contrasted with such inventions as\nthe atomic bomb; and perhaps this may seriously affect the construction put on\nthe Patent Act of 1952.\nThis was certainly the public policy advocated by Mr. Justice Douglas in\nhis opinion in the A&P case 37:\nThe patent involved in the present case belongs to this list of incred\nible patents which the Patent Office has spawned.\nIf I understand Mr. Justice Douglas correctly, he regards a patent for an ev\neryday household item as an \"incredible patent.\" Certainly he so classified one\nfor a collar.\nApparently Mr.\nJustice Douglas views a collar as among \"the\nsimplest of devices,\" one of a \"host of gadgets,\" for the improvement of which\nmen should not be encouraged to devote their inventive faculties. This view, it\nshould be observed, was merely Mr. Justice Douglas's opinion, concurred in, at\nthat time, by Mr. Justice Black and by no other justice.\nThe records show, however, that at another time a particular invention in\na collar was important enough to revolutionize a whole industry, and a patent\nfor it was sustained by one of our greatest judges, Learned Hand 38 . Probably\nJustices Douglas and Black themselves have benefited by that very invention,\nfor it is doubtful whether they still wear the prior-art collars. Furthermore,\nthe Supreme Court itself has sustained a patent for a bare collar button 39, and\nmany patents for articles of wearing apparel and other \"gadgets\" of considerable\nvalue to the public have heretofore been sustained.\nAs later will be made more evident, the part played by individual inven\ntors and small companies in the development of such inventions is still great.\nAnd still pertinent is the unheeded call in late depression years of the then\ncommissioner of patents, the Honorable Conway P. Coe:\nWhat a patent issues to an inventor we purport to give him the\nright, the exclusive right, for a term of 17 years to prevent others\nfrom making, using, or selling the invention covered by it. But we\nsay that with our tongue in our cheek, for we know better than he\nthat by our present method of adjudicating patent rights he will\nfind it exceedingly difficult to prevent the wrongful appropriation\nof his property and may be compelled to stand helpless while he is\ndespoiled. . . .\nMy conviction is that the poor inventor, and through him the pub\nlic, suffers injustice precisely for the reason and to the extent that\nthe monopoly, the exclusive right, purportedly bestowed on him is\n37Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v.

What we need is not to decrease but\nto enhance the monopoly called a patent.\nGenuine protection in\nthat form would be the last surviving bulwark standing between the\ninventor and the onslaught of mighty corporations.\nA patent should function as a leveler whereby an individual or a\ncompany of small means may be enabled to hold his or its rights of\nproperty against the prssure of the strongest adversary. It should\nhave a protective character like that of a high-power rifle in the\nhands of a puny man beset by a wildly charging bull elephant. Un\nfortunately, that patent affords no safeguards. . . .\nThe patent system of the United States, more than any other in the\nworld, offers hope, encouragement, opportunity and recompense to\nan individual or a company of small resources. It is as democratic\nas the Constitution which begot it.\nCongress has recognized this problem at least partially and has tried to\nsolve it. The Patent Act of 1952, it is to be hoped, has restored the standard\nof invention at least to what it was originally and continued to be up to very\nrecent years. If questions of public policy are involved, therefore, Congress has\nmade plain that its purpose in enacting the new Patent Act was to remove the\ndiscouragement of inventors induced by prior decisions of the courts.\nParticularly in view of the extremely large number of important and break\nthrough inventions that still flow from independent inventors and small com\npanies 40, we cannot sit back and merely wait for the fruits of government-\nsponsored and large-corporation research. Never before in modern history has\nAmerica been threatened so seriously from abroad - both economically and\nmilitarily - and hence never before has it needed so desperately to encourage\ninvention from all quarters.\nWith the same end in view of encouraging invention, Congress, in 1954, in\nSection 1235 of the Internal Review Code, allowed capital-gains tax treatment to\nprofessional inventors and their backers, under certain circumstances, while dis\ncriminating against authors. Recent interview studies of independent inventors,\nconducted under the auspices of The Academy of Applied Science at Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, revealed fully the error of the Treasury Department's proposed\nrepeal of this Section 1235 together with the removal of sales of patents by an\ninventor (even an amateur inventor) from possible capital gains treatment 41 .\nNow these independent inventors represented a wide range of experience in\ninnovation engaged in from six to more than forty years. Their more impor\ntant inventions included: methods of calibrating D.C. instruments; magnetic\namplified control systems; mechanical-electrical transducers; systems to con\nvert capacitance changes to output voltages; shades that keep out heat but let\nin sunlight; inventions in image intensification; medical instruments; methods\n40Donald A.

(The inventions which I have italicized have revolution\nized industries.)\nMost of these inventors sell or exclusively license their inventions, thereby\nplacing themselves under the capital-gains category of Section 1235; or they own\ntheir own companies, which in most cases have been built around one or more\nof their own inventions, with the capital-gains provision used to build up the\ncompany. Their technically successful inventions ranged from about 20 to 80\nper cent, with a mean about one in three. Of these, only about one in five has\nbeen a substantial income-producer to the inventor; the average yearly return\nfrom licensing or selling inventions being from $10,000 to $50,000.\nThe average time lag between the making of an invention and the receipt\nof returns therefrom was five years; and more than half of all the commercially\nsuccessful inventions had to be pioneered on the market by the inventor himself\nbefore others could be persuaded to adopt them. Only one of these inventors\nreceived any financial backing from a government contract in the making of his\ninventions.\nThe inventors interviewed, moreover, had not only provided the country with\nmany new products and processes, but had, in the process, created thousands\nof new jobs, and tens of millions of dollars of new sales. Dare we risk discour\naging this well of current invention by making an already highly dangerous and\nspeculative profession untenable to pursue 42 . Unsympathetic decisions by the\ncourts or administrative agencies can only negate the policy of Congress which\nwould encourage inventors to continue to invent and businessmen to take risks\non the development of invention.\n42Benjamin F.

This par\nticular invention was selected because its technology is familiar to\nall types of reader and because almost everything that could happen\ndid happen to Bell; except that he was saved by a single vote in the\nSupreme Court from the anonymity experienced by many current\ninventors.\nBy turning to a detailed study of the so-called Bell Telephone Cases, in\nvolving an invention understandable and intimately known by everyone 1, we\ncan both tie together many of the various principles of patent law heretofore\ndiscussed, and set up a real laboratory experiment by which to observe the\nrather typical actions and reactions of American industry and business to inde\npendent innovation. In this way we can learn something about the intricacies\nand mysteries of patent litigation in the courts.\n4.1\nThe Circumstances Underlying Bell's Invention\nA little, first, about Alexander Graham Bell. He was not a native-born American\n2 . This has some significance for what happened in this case. At the time here\ninvolved, only American citizens could file an intention, called a \"caveat,\" and\nfile later a patent application for an invention. If the caveat was seasonably\nfollowed by a patent application, the inventor could thereby obtain the benefit\nof the early date of the caveat filing. Had Bell been an American citizen with\n1Frederick V. Hunt, Electroacoustics, Harvard Monographs in Applied Science, No.\n5,\nHarvard University Press and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1954, pp. 23-25.\n2The large number of basic inventions heretofore made by foreign-born Americans should\ngive us cause for concern in light of present-day security restrictions and their effect upon the\nencouragement of invention\n\nCreate or Perish\nthe right to file a caveat, certain alleged prior inventions by others could not\nhave been asserted against his claim of prior inventorship. Bell had to wait until\nhe had completed his inventive processes, at least theoretically, before he could\nfile his application in the Patent Office.\nBell was born on March 3, 1847, in Edinburgh, the son of a teacher of\nelocution. At a very early age, he naturally became interested in the problems of\nspeech and lip reading and ultimately assisted his father, who was the professor\nof elocution at the University of London. When the latter was offered a position\nin this country, he sent his son, in his stead, to join the staffof the Boston School\nfor the Deaf.\nAt this time, the Western Union Company, having bought up the small\nindividual operating telegraph systems in the country, was in control of the\ncountry's first national communications chain. One of the problems that it was\nfacing was that of the simultaneous transmission of a plurality of Morse-code\nmessages over the same wires. Its engineers were heavily engaged in trying to\nsolve this problem. Bell heard about it, became interested, and decided to set\nout to solve it. Fortunately, in his impecunious state, he met a Boston attorney,\nGardner Greene Hubbard, who, becoming intrigued with the potential financial\nreturn from an invention that could solve this problem, agreed to supply funds\nwith which Bell could carry on his researches.\nThe concept that Bell evolved related to the simultaneous transmission of\na plurality of different tones, each carrying a different telegraph message. At\nthe receiving end, a number of tuned reeds were provided, each tuned to one of\nthe different tones. Bell reasoned that only the reed tuned to a particular tone\nwould reproduce that tone, and so each message would be selectively received\nby its corresponding reed.\nIt is important for our purposed to remember that this multiple-telegraphy\nproblem, called the\"harmonic telegraph,\" was the concept that Bell set out to\nexplore. This is important because it illustrates what often happens when an\ninventor or applied scientist sets out to solve a problem. Frequently, the inves\ntigator makes an accidental auxiliary discovery or observes some phenomenon\nhe cannot explain. When given the freedom to drop the planned research goal\nfor the moment and to explore this diversion, inventors have made far more im\nportant inventions than the original research project contemplated, devices that\nsolved different and ofter more important problems. There is the serious ques\ntion whether today, under government sponsorship of research, and even under\nthe research policies of many industrial companies, the investigator would have\nthat freedom to stop momentarily, to lay aside the original goal, and to explore\nthe striking new channel.\nBell was joined in his experiments by Thomas A. Watson, and the two worked\ntogether in a garret, as the popular story has it, on the harmonic telegraph. One\nday Watson misadjusted a reed, so that instead of vibrating back and forth, to\nmake and break an electrical circuit and thereby to reproduce the telegraphic\ndot-and-dash message, the reed became stuck fast in a closed-circuit position.\nBell, being in the room at the time, heard something he had never heard before,\na kind of muffled tone of entirely different quality and clarity from the ringing\n\nPatents in Action\ntones of make-and-break reeds. He was puzzled as to how, in a completely closed\ncircuit, the tone could be reproduced. This was perhaps the first inkling that\ncommunication results could be obtained other than by making and breaking\nelectrical circuits. Here was a tone that was coming through when the circuit\nremained closed, the stuck reed apparently responding to current variations in\nthe winding behind it.\nMind you, Bell was still working on this harmonic\ntelegraph problem.\nAt this point, however, realizing the significance of this discovery, Bell went\nto Mr. Hubbard and requested permission to stop work on the harmonic tele\ngraph, and to start investigating the problems inherent in speech reproduction.\nMr. Hubbard, interested in the big bounty awaiting the first person to solve\nWestern Union's problem of multiple telegraphy, was unable to see any future\nin a speech machine, and so repeatedly instructed Bell to continue on the har\nmonic telegraph and to forget esoteric speech problems.\nThe record shows,\nhowever, that Bell slanted his work towards a speech machine, under the guise\nof a modified version of the harmonic telegraph.\nOn February 14, 1876, Bell filed a patent application. This application pur\nported to cover the harmonic telegraph for simultaneously producing multiple-\ntone messages. The application clearly explained, however, that it covered also\na machine that would reproduce vocal sounds. Bell put both inventions in one\ncase. On March 7, less than one month later, the Patent Office issued the first\nBell patent on that application. The patent number was 174,465. Note that it\ntook Bell less than a month to get his patent. Contrast that with the several\nyears that may be involved in issuing a patent today, particularly in the light of\nthe events to be subsequently related, where others soon commenced to violate\nBell's rights. At least Bell, unlike a present-day inventor, promptly obtained a\npatent that enabled him to try to enforce his rights, instead of having to sit back\nand wait in frustration. Here is the fortuitous circumstance that Bell obtained\nhis patent promptly.\n4.2\nBell's Basic Patent\nFigure 2 reproduces part of the basic Bell patent relating to the original tele\nphone, with Fig. 7 thereof illustrating a mouthpiece at A, into which the voice\nsounds were to be directed. There was a metal diaphragm a that would vibrate\nin accordance with those voice sounds. Behind the diaphragm a was an electro\nmagnetic winding b that was connected in the following electrical circuit: from\nground E, through a battery, to and through the winding b, along the line e,\nto a similar receiving winding f, and then back to ground again, at g. Thus\nthere is provided a closed circuit for the flow of electric current. In this patent,\nBell explained that as the diaphragm a moved closer to and farther away from\nthe winding b, in response to voice vibrations, the effect of its varying position,\nrelative to the winding b, would be able to induce, in this winding b, varia\ntions in the current flowing therein. By this technique, the exact undulations of\nsound produced by the voice can be converted into corresponding electric cur\nrent undulations or variations in the above-mentioned circuity. The receiving or\n\nCreate or Perish\nreproducing diaphragm i would thus be attracted to and repelled from the re\nceiving winding f, causing air in front of the diaphragm i to be correspondingly\nset into vibration, thereby to reproduce the original voice sound. Drawing from Alexander Graham Bell's original telephone patent.\nFig. 4.1: Part of Bell's original telephone patent. (This image is public domain\nand is not protected by copyright.)\nNow this is the theory that Bell proposed in his patent. The evidence ad\nduced in subsequent litigation involving his patent demonstrated that Bell had\nnever made this device work for voice sounds until after he had received his\npatent. It is important to note, however, that he did have a valid theory of\noperation. More of this later.\nHis attorney presented two kinds of claims in the patent. It is to be recalled\nthat one of the patentable classes of invention is a new piece of apparatus,\nwhich may be a new combination of old elements, operating in a new cooperative\nmanner to achieve a new result. It will be recalled, also, that the law permits the\npatenting of a new process or art or method, namely a new series of steps capable\nof performance with any of a host of different types of apparatus. The concept\nthat Bell had evolved was a method wherein a continuous electric current was\nto be maintained, but whose value was to be changed in accordance with voice-\nsound undulations, and without interrupting the complete-circuit flow of the\ncurrent. That, Bell asserted, was his new method. His attorney worded the\nclaims in both method and apparatus form, and it is wise that he did so. It will\nbe demonstrated shortly that, had he worded the claims in specific apparatus\nform alone, some of Bell's early competitors might have been free of the charge\nof infringement.\nBut, having worded a broad claim to embrace the method\nalso, the attorney provided the court with grounds for construing the infringing\ndevices, which were pieces of apparatus different from Bell's, as falling within\nthe scope of Bell's invention. To quote claim 5:\n\nPatents in Action\nThe method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds\ntelegraphically, as herein described, by causing electrical undula\ntions, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the\nsaid vocal or other sounds, substantially as set forth.\nOf course, the Patent Office would not let a claim like that be written today\nbecause of present-day requirements for the recitations of structure in more\nprecise form, nor would the courts be likely to sustain such a general wording.\nThe Patent Office (and the courts) have become very ritualistic and formal.\nThe important thing for our story, however, is that Bell's attorney obtained a\npatent both for the steps of the method and for a piece of apparatus.\nWatson, working under Bell's direction, evolved the principle of substituting\nfor this electromagnetic apparatus a permanent magnet. This simplified the\ncommercial construction, a second patent, No. 186,787, issued the following\nyear, on January 30, 1877, principally for the improvement of a fixed magnet.\nBell, still struggling under the adverse conditions usually besetting the in\ndividual inventor and entrepreneur, did the natural thing. He went to West\nern Union, the party most interested in communications, and offered his basic\npatent for the telephone for $100,000. Western Union, in turn, consulted with\nthe ablest scientific people and engineers and the best business minds of that\nday and came to the conclusion that there was no commercial future for an\ninstrument that would reproduce voice sounds. Hence, it turned down Bell's\noffer 3 .\nIt may be interesting to depart briefly from the main theme to point out that\nthe supposedly ablest industrial, scientific, and government people of our own\nday make similar unimaginative decisions over and over again. Where inventors\nformerly persisted and proceeded somehow on their own, as did Bell, in the true\nAmerican tradition, and sometimes made a success of their inventions to the\nbenefit of the country, the recent policies of our government, our industry, and\nour courts, as will be shown later, have tended to kill or at least hamper much\nof the incentive.\n4.3\nThe Founding of Bell's Company - and the Pirates\nIn Bell's day, however, the American pioneering spirit still existed, and Bell,\nunthwarted, determined to promote his invention himself. He and his associates\nraised capital in Boston and formed the American Bell Telephone Company.\nWithin a year or two, they were actually supplying instruments to the public.\nHaving now embarked upon a business, as distinguished from a research venture,\nBell needed to and did obtain practical improvement patents for commercially\nacceptable structures. And the demand for these crude telephone instruments\nwas so great that the new company could not keep up with its orders.\nTwo short years later, in 1879 (once Bell had shown the way) the Western\nUnion reversed its decision that there was no commercial future in the speaking\n3The technical and financial advisers to industrialist Chauncey Depew were instrumental\nin the later turn-down of an offer of a one-third interest in Bell's enterprise for the sum of\n$10,000.\n\nCreate or Perish\ntelegraph toy, and it formed the American Speaking and Telephone Company.\nIn typical free-enterprise fashion, stimulated by the fact that Bell had obtained\na patent, Western Union employed two renowned inventors to work around what\nBell had done and to avoid his patent 4 . The whole world is familiar with the\nnames of Thomas Alva Edison and Elisha Gray, the men selected by Western\nUnion.\nThomas Edison, upon his employment by Western Union, went to work to\ndevise what we would today call a transducer for using the voice vibrations\nto affect the magnitude of the electric current far more effectively than Bell's\ndid, and came up with the carbon-button microphone, which is still in use.\nWestern Union, accordingly, treated Bell's patent as limited to armatures and\ndiaphragms and put on the market its own telephone, using Edison's invention.\nThis carbon-button microphone performed infinitely better than did Bell's crude\nelectromagnetic device, so that the quality of the Western Union instrument was\nfar above that of the American Bell Telephone Company's. One can begin to\nsee the problem facing the latter company when customers could obtain a much\nimproved instrument from its competitor.\nTo solve this, Bell's company decided to employ inventors other than Bell,\nin an effort to produce as good an instrument as Edison's carbon-button mi\ncrophone. They therefore hired Emil Berliner, who had effected a filing in the\nPatent Office two weeks earlier than Edison's patent application for the carbon\nbutton microphone. (And this was, of course, one of the reasons why he was\nselected.) While Berliner did not invent a carbon-button microphone, he did\ndevise a type of metal-contact microphone that could be termed a variable\nresistance microphone. This was an apparatus operating upon a different physi\ncal principal (variable resistance) from that of Bell's inductive armature-diaphragm\napparatus, and, if new, was entitled to independent patent protection. The sig\nnificance of this is that, since variable resistance is also the principle underlying\nthe operating of the Edison carbon-button microphone, if Berliner could obtain\nbroad patent claims to a variable-resistance microphone, the Bell Company\nwould have another tool with which to ward off Western Union's challenge.\nThe Patent Office set up an interference proceeding between Berliner and\nEdison to determine which was entitled to the broad variable-resistance-microphone\nclaims. It is interesting to observe that years later, when Berliner's patent fi\nnally issued, it had the effect of extending the basic \"monopoly,\" as that term\nis popularly used, of the American Bell Telephone Company. The patent was\nattacked unsuccessfully upon the ground of extension of monopoly by the At\ntorney General 5, though later it was invalidated by the Circuit Court for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts as anticipated by Edison's work 6 .\nThe American Bell Telephone Company held the view that Bell's basic\npatent was very broad and was not restricted to any particular form of appara\n4History shows over and over again that, far from stifling progress, the granting of im\nportant patents causes industry to look for alternative approaches in an effort to avoid the\npatent, thereby further promoting the progress of the useful arts.\n5United States v. American Bell Telephone Co. & Emil Berliner, 167 U.S. 244 (1897).\n6109 F. 976 (1901).\n\nPatents in Action\ntus. Under such interpretation, of course, a telephone using Edison's improved\ntransducer, the carbon-button microphone, would infringe the broad telephone\nclaims of Bell's patent. Bell could not, therefore, stand by and sanction the\nWestern Union infringement upon his patent.\nClaim 5 of the basic patent,\nquoted earlier, does not specify whether the electrical undulations similar in\nform to the vibrations of the air are caused by use of a variable resistance or by\nuse of a magnetic armature circuit, but very broadly covers that they are made\nto do so. Thus, on the theory that this broad claim covered any way found to\ndo this equivalent to Bell's disclosed magnetic armature-diaphragm apparatus,\nAmerican Bell Telephone Company sued Western Union.\nI have said nothing yet about Elisha Gray, who, like Edison, had been em\nployed as an inventor by Western Union. One of the reasons for his employment\nwas that on the very same day, February 14, 1876, that Alexander Graham Bell\nhad filed his patent application for the basic patent, Elisha Gray, an American\ncitizen, had filed in the Patent Office a caveat for a telephone. He had appar\nently independently conceived the idea of having a closed circuit and of varying\nthe value of the current therein, in accordance with voice sounds. (See Figure\n3.) As the voice vibrations moved a diaphragm a (Fig. 1) back and forth, a\nwire A was simultaneously inserted to varying depths into a conducting water\nsolution B. Hence, in theory, the resistance between the wire A in the water and\nwater solution B varied because there was more or less contact area between the\nwire and the water. This, then, was a variable-resistance device, moving back\nand forth in the same way as the air undulations, in an uninterrupted electrical\ncircuit. But Gray did not follow up this caveat with a patent application, and\nhis rights were accordingly lost. He was still useful to Western Union, however,\nbecause, whether or not he obtained a patent, Bell's patent could be invalidated\nif Gray had actually made the invention before Bell. There was also a charge of\nfraud raised in the Telephone Cases to the effect that word of Gray's caveat was\npassed to Bell's attorney, and that the latter supposedly arranged for Bell's ap\nplication to be changed in the Patent Office to include Gray's variable-resistance\nprinciple, but the Supreme Court found no evidence at all of such fraud.\nA great deal of testimony was taken in the suit between Bell Telephone and\nWestern Union, and the attorneys for the latter advised their client that they\nthought Bell was going to win the case. Since they had an interference in the\nPatent Office, Edison v. Berliner, on the broad variable-resistance issue, and\nsince they had this court litigation on the basic Bell patent, Western Union\ndecided to see if a compromise could be reached.\nIt should be added that,\nalthough Western Union had infringed Bell's claim 5, the Bell Company, on\nthe other hand, could not operate commercially without using Edison's carbon-\nbutton microphone invention.\nIn other words, the Western Union attorneys\nwere sure they would lose their suit, but Bell was also anxious to settle it to\nobtain the rights under Edison's invention.\nAccordingly, a settlement was reached on the basis that, for a period of\nseventeen years, the American Bell Telephone Company would pay one-fifth of\nall its proceeds to Western Union, Western Union would give the rest of its\nstock of telephone equipment to the America Bell Telephone Company, and\n\nCreate or Perish Drawing of a part of Elisha Gray's caveat.\nFig. 4.2: A part of Elisha Gray's caveat. (This image is public domain and is\nnot protected by copyright.)\nfrom that time on Western Union would not engage in the telephone business\nfor the seventeen-year period. This, of course, was a business decision, forced\nperhaps by the patent difficulties. It certainly stands out, however, as one of\nthe most fateful management decisions imaginable. Looked at with hindsight,\nit was responsible for the subsequent decline of Western Union.\n4.4\nEnters the Supreme Court\nAfter the court litigation with Western Union was settled, other equally ambi\ntious entrepreneurs, in the normal American tradition, sprang up all over the\ncountry, each setting up a small telephone company and proceeding along its own\nmerry way in defiance of Bell's patent. Suits were thereupon brought against\none Dolbear, a professor at Tufts College, against the Molecular Telephone\nCompany in the southern district of New York, against the Clay Commercial\nTelephone Company, in the eastern district of Pennsylvania, and against the\nPeople's Telephone Company and the Overland Telephone Company, both in\nthe southern district of New York. In each suit, Bell's patent was sustained.\nFinally, all these cases came up before the United States Supreme Court, which\ndecided to consolidate them and to hear all the appeals at one time. These Tele\nphone Cases are reported in a complete volume of the Supreme Court decisions,\nreferred to as 126 U.S.\nThe defendants contested the validity of Bell's patent. They also denied\ninfringement upon the basis that the latter's patent must be limited to what is\nshown in the patent, and none of the supposedly infringing telephones used the\nmagnetic armature-diaphragm apparatus of the patent. I shall now examine\nhow the Supreme Court treated these various defenses, and what its decisions\nwere.\nFirst of all, the reader may gain a picture of how close to the prior art\nimportant inventions often are, by learning that these defendants cited some\nfifteen different men who, they maintained, made this invention before Bell.\n\nPatents in Action\nThey included a Philip Reis of Germany, the before-mentioned Elisha Gray\nand Thomas Edison, Professor Dolbear, and one Daniel Drawbaugh. The de\nfendants also asserted that there were eight United States patents, six British\npatents, and a French one, all issued before Bell's basic patent and disclos\ning the same invention. The defendants alleged, further, that there were six\nUnited States patents, three British patents, and a Canadian one for the same\ninvention as Bell's second improvement patent, before mentioned. They cited\nsome sixty-three publications before Bell's, including French, British, German,\nUnited States, Italian, and Irish publications, all supposedly anticipating Bell's\nconcept. And in connection with the latter's second patent, they listed fifty-one\npublications to show that others had thought of the invention before Bell.\nNow these were technical people, applied scientists, business people, and\nattorneys, who were advancing rational arguments; they were trying to persuade\na court that Bell's contribution was anticipated. I proceed, therefore, to the\ndetails of these defenses and how the court handled them.\nThe first defense here involved is that Bell was attempting to patent a natural\nforce, a scientific fact. He was purporting, in claim 5, to monopolize the scientific\nfact that, if one varies the electric current in the same way that the sound\nproduced by the voice varies, speech will be reproduced. This, the defendants\nmaintained, is a fact of nature to which our patent laws do not extend. And they\ncited a Supreme Court decision to support that principle, O'Reilly v. Morse\n(15 How. 62). In that case, Samuel F. B. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph,\ntried to claim all uses of electricity for transmitting intelligence from one point\nto another. The Supreme Court there held that an attempt to patent all such\npossible uses of electricity is too broad and is really an attempt to patent a force\nof nature. The court struck down Morse's broadest claim, claim 8.\nSo the defendants in Bell's suits, by analogy, argued that Bell's claim 5 gave\nhim the monopoly of all possible ways of making these electrical currents cor\nrespond to the voice undulations, and, as such, represented merely a discovery\nof nature that was not one of those things that, under our patent laws, was\nsusceptible to patent protection. As previously explained, a scientific discovery,\nper se, is not patentable under our laws.\nWhat did the court answer? To quote from page 534:\nIn O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, it was decided that a claim in\nbroad terms (p. 86) for the use of the motive power of the electric\nor galvanic current called 'electromagnetism,' however developed,\nfor making or printing intelligible characters, letters or signs . . . was\nvoid, because (p. 20) it was a claim for a patent for an effect pro\nduced by the use of electromagnetism, distinct from the process or\nmachinery necessary to produce it.\nThe court continued that in Bell's case, on the other hand,\nthe claim is not for the use of a current of electricity in its natural\nstate as it comes from the battery, but for putting a continuous\n\nCreate or Perish\ncurrent in a closed circuit into a certain specified condition suited\nto the transmission of vocal and other sounds, and using it in that\ncondition for that purpose.\nThe court was not unmindful of the fact that\nit may be that electricity cannot be used at all for the transmission\nof speech except in the way Bell has discovered, and that, therefore,\npractically, his patent gives him exclusive use for that purpose, but\nthat does not make his claim one for the use of electricity distinct\nfrom the particular process with which it is connected in his patent.\nIt will, it is true, show more clearly the great importance of his\ndiscovery, but it will not invalidate his patent.\nHence, concluded the Supreme Court, this is not a case where Bell is taking\nraw nature, the force of a battery, the force of a current, and trying to claim\nall uses of it for speech reproduction.\nThis is a case, rather, where Bell is\nmolding the current into something that was not there originally, and varying\nthat current in accordance with the variation of air pressure produced by voice\nsounds. This is a method or process. It is not pure scientific discovery. It is,\nrather, the application of scientific discovery to a particular problem. It is the\nkind of invention that our patent laws cover.\nThe next defense advanced was that Bell did not really make his invention\nwork until after his patent issued. It will be recalled that Bell had witnessed\nthe experiment of the stuck reed, but that was not voice. He had not actually\ntransmitted voice at that time, and, in fact, he did not suceed in doing so until\nafter his basic patent issued. So, said the defendants, Bell did not really make\nthe invention until after he had obtained the patent.\nHow did the court answer that? To quote from page 535:\nIt is quite true that when Bell applied for his patent he had never\nactually transmitted telegraphically spoken words so that they could\nbe distinctly heard and understood at the receiving end, but,\nthe court continued - and this is very important -\nin his specification he did describe accurately and with admirable\nclearness his process, that is to say, the exact electrical condition that\nmust be created to accomplish his purpose, and he also described,\nwith sufficient precision to enable one of ordinary skill in such mat\nters to make it, a form of apparatus which, if used in the way pointed\nout, would produce the required effect, receive the words, and carry\nthem to and deliver them at the appointed place.\nThe court concluded on that topic (p. 536)\nThe law does not require that a discoverer or inventor, in order to\nget a patent for a process, must have succeeded in bringing his art\n\nPatents in Action\nto the highest degree of perfection. It is enough if he describes his\nmethod with sufficient clearness and precision to enable those skilled\nin the matter to understand what the process is, and if he points\nout some practical way of putting it into operation. This Bell did.\nHence arises the rule of law, previously treated, that the filing of a theoreti\ncally operative patent application constitutes, in contemplation of the law, a\nconstructive reduction to practice of that invention. An inventor does not need\nto wait until he can accumulate the several million dollars necessary to build\na computer and test it. If he has some new principles that are worthy of pro\ntection and he can theoretically demonstrate their operability, he can obtain a\npatent.\nThe next defense advanced was that there was no infringement because,\nas earlier pointed out, claim 5 of that patent called for the apparatus \"sub\nstantially as set forth.\" Bell set forth an electromagnetic armature-diaphragm\nmicrophone. The defendants maintained that they were not using those electro\nmagnets. Professor Dolbear 7, for example, employed a microphone that appears\nto resemble what we would now describe as an electrostatic microphone, acting\nas a variable impedance in the circuit. This defendant's position was that his\napparatus, which was restricted to inducing current variations by moving the\ndiaphragm nearer to and farther from the electromagnetic winding.\nThe court dealt with this defense of noninfringement as follows (p. 538):\nThe patent is both for the magneto and variable resistance methods\nand for the particular magneto apparatus which is described, or is\nequivalent.\nWhat the court is saying here is that, insofar as the method is concerned, it\nmay be practiced whether one uses a magneto, meaning the Bell electromagnetic\narmature-diaphragm structure, or a variable-resistance device. The use of either\ndevice still involves the method of causing the electric current to vary with the\nvoice-sound undulations. As for the apparatus, however, the court agreed that\nthe apparatus described in the patent claim was only the magnetic armature\ndiaphragm apparatus that Bell disclosed, or its equivalent. While it is not clear,\nthe court later appeared to imply that the variable-resistance device was also\nan equivalent of the \"magneto.\" At any rate, it can be seen how important was\nthe decision by Bell's attorney to insert the magic word \"method,\" as well as\napparatus, in the claim.\nTo continue with the court's analysis:\nIt is undoubtedly true that when Bell got his patent he thought the\nmagneto method was the best. Indeed, he said, in express terms,\nhe preferred it, but that does not exclude the use of the other if it\nturns out to be the most desirable way of using the process under any\n7United States Letters Patents Nos. 239, 742 and 240, 518, issued April 5 and 26, 1881,\nrespectively.\n\nCreate or Perish\ncircumstance. Both forms of apparatus operate on a closed circuit\nby gradual changes of intensity, and not by alternately making and\nbreaking the circuit.\nIt will be apparent hereinafter that the prior art came very close to Bell. The\nwhole distinction was that, instead of keeping the circuit closed all the time,\nand varying the current in it, the prior-art inventors interrupted the circuit,\nby actually make-and-break switching, which was unable to reproduce complex\nwaveforms, such as speech, although it could reproduce musical tones.\nThe court concluded (p. 539):\nSurely a patent for such a discovery is not to be confined to the mere\nmeans he improvised to prove the reality of its conception.\nHence, another important point of patent law. If an invention is a broad\ninvention, a court could construe it broadly. If the advance is a pioneer advance,\none cannot escape infringement by trying to obtain the same result in another\nequivalent way. This matter of range of equivalents returns again to the matter\nof the attitude of the court and its conclusion as to the scope of an invention. If\na court considers that a real advance has been made, and that the defendant is\nusing the substance of the invention, the range of equivalents may be broad. If,\non the other hand, a court considers the invention to be narrow, it may find the\nsomewhat different structures of the defendant to be noninfringing, by refusing\nto grant a substantial range of equivalent structures.\nNow I come to the details of the prior art set up by the defendants as\nanticipating Bell's invention.\nOne of the prior-art publications was that of\nBourseul in Paris, in 1854. This, it should be understood, was twenty-two years\nbefore Bell's invention. Here is what the Supreme Court held that Bourseul had\nin mind (p. 542):\nAs early as 1854 Bourseul, in his communication which has already\nbeen referred to, had said, substantially, that if the vibrations of air\nproduced by the human voice in articulate speech could be repro\nduced by means of electricity, at a distance, the speech itself would\nbe reproduced and heard there. As a means of stimulating inquiry\nto that end he called attention to the principle on which the electric\ntelegraph was based and suggested an application of that principle\nto such a purpose. He said \". . . Suppose that a man speaks nears\na movable disk, sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations\nof the voice, that this disk alternately makes and breaks connec\ntions with a battery, you have at a distance another disk which will\nsimultaneously execute the same vibrations.\"\nThis operation is show in Figure 4.\nBourseul, however, was merely proposing a problem insofar as speech was\nconcerned. He had everything there - almost. He was even proposing to use the\nprinciple of the telegraph to make the electric current vary the same way that\n\nPatents in Action Drawing of Bourseul's make-and-break concept.\nFig. 4.3: Bourseul's make-and-break concept. (This image is public domain and\nis not protected by copyright.)\nthe voice vibrations vary. But note that he had in mind making and breaking\nthe electrical circuit.\nThe next prior art was that of Philip Reis of Germany, some fifteen years\nbefore Bell made his invention.\nReis's work involved a device for reproduc\ning musical sounds wherein a diaphragm moved back and forth in response to\nsound waves, and caused an arm correspondingly to move back and forth and\nmake and break the connection with an electric circuit. The Supreme Court\ninvited attention to Reis's own description of his apparatus as involving a sys\ntem wherein \"each sound wave causes a breaking and closing of the current.\"\nFigure 5 illustrates the Reis construction, as shown in a paper of von Legat,\nembodying a diaphragm c that moves an arm e into and out of contact with\na contact point d. The screw h can adjust the extent of this make-and-break\nadjustment. It could even produce Bell's kind of operation, if properly adjusted\nto that the circuit did not make and break, but gave rise to a variable-contact\nresistance phenomenon. This was proved by the experiments of Blake 8 .\n8126 U.S. 196.\n\nCreate or Perish Drawing of Philip Reis's construction.\nFig. 4.4: Philip Reis's construction. (This image is public domain and is not\nprotected by copyright.)\n\nPatents in Action\nProfessor Hunt 9 has an extremely interesting account of Reis's work in his\nbook already cited. Here briefly is his conclusion, as a scientist, as to the nature\nof Reis's work.\nIn spite of stout efforts to show the contrary, no evidence could be\nfound in Reis's writings that he had ever contemplated any mode of\noperation of his transmitter other than one involving complete inter\nruption of the current. What made this conclusion convincing was\nthe additional fact that his receiver was so insensitive that it could\nnot have produced an audible reproduction of speech even when his\ntransmitter was in the rare condition of adjustment necessary for\nthe production of an undulating current.\nThe Supreme Court summarized Reis's work as follows (p. 544):\nIt was left for Bell to discover that the failure was due not to work\nmanship but to the principle which was adopted as the basis of what\nhad to be done. He found that what he called the intermittent cur\nrent - one caused by alternately opening and closing the circuit -\ncould not be made under any circumstances to reproduce the deli\ncate forms of air vibrations caused by the human voice in articulate\nspeech, but that the true way was to operate on unbroken current\nby increasing and diminishing its intensity.\nSo, the court concluded,\nif Reis had kept on he might have found out the way to succeed, but\nhe stopped and failed. Bell took up his work and carried it on to a\nsuccessful result.\nLastly, with regard to the alleged prior investigation of Drawbaugh, the\nPeople's Telephone Company came upon this prolific inventor who, long after\nthe event, was prepared to claim having built a large number of telephones before\nBell. For some unexplained reason, he only had bits and pieces of them to show,\nnone of which worked. But he produced some fifty witnesses, farmers and the\nlike, all of whom swore that they had heard speech coming over these various\ninstruments long before Bell made his invention. In view of other circumstances\nthe majority of the court just could not believe this. While Drawbaugh had\nindicated that he did not have money to file patents and that he did not realize\nin time the significance of the invention, the court found that he had been able\nto raise money to file patents on other inventions, that he had gone with friends\nto a centennial exhibition at which Bell made a demonstration, and had seen\nBell's instrument, but never claimed to his friends that he had already done the\nsame. This distinct feeling of prior inventorship was apparently not brought\nout in Drawbaugh until after the People's Telephone Company had considered\nhim as a possible champion by whom to defeat Bell. The majority of the court\n9Frederick V. Hunt, Electroacoustics, p. 28.\n\nCreate or Perish\nfound that Drawbaugh did not make the invention before Bell, although three\njudges disagreed. So, by a 4-to-3 vote, two of the judges not participating, Bell's\npatent was sustained by the Supreme Court.\nIt may be relevant to point out that four days after delivering the majority\nopinion Chief Justice Waite died. What would have happened to Bell's patent\nwithout the persuasion of Chief Justice Waite? Suppose he had died a little\nearlier? Would there have been a 3-to-3 sustaining of the patent, or would no\nAmerican schoolchild today know of Alexander Graham Bell?\nAnother point of interest is the reluctance of the courts to trust oral testi\nmony, alone, with regard to dates of invention and demonstration 10 . If Draw\nbaugh had made the invention and had kept proper written records and mod\nels, these, together with the attestations of technically qualified witnesses, would\nhave undoubtedly led the majority of the court to a different conclusion 11 . This\nis a lesson for the applied scientist and inventor on the importance of keeping\ndated records and models and having them witnessed by those who understand\nthe invention.\nAnother interesting fact is that Bell's invention gave rise to a situation\nwhereby, within the quarter of a century following it, more than 3000 patents\nare reported to have been issued for improvements relating to the telephone.\nSupposedly informed and well-meaning people have sometimes attacked that\npatent system as discouraging invention, because the pioneer gets a basic patent\nand can, for a limited time, exclude others.\nThe history of patents shows,\nhowever, that, far from discouraging invention, the system fosters and stimulates\na myriad of new devices to get around the patent or to improve upon it, in\norder to bargain for an exchange or rights, as demonstrated above. Truly this\naccomplishes the end set forth in the Constitution \"to promote the progress of\nscience and useful arts.\"\nIt is of interest, also, to note the considered opinion of Professor Edward\nL. Bowles, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has made a deep\nstudy of the history of the American Telephone Company and its subsidiaries.\nProfessor Bowles has reason to believe that the Telephone Company policy, with\nregard to equipment ownership, may well have resulted from the influence of the\nequipment-leasing policy of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation. It appears\nthat, while Bell has sometimes been credited with altruism in establishing the\npolicy of not requiring the telephone user to own his equipment, his financial\nbacker, G. G. Hubbard, was a close associate of Gordon McKay, the former\nguiding light of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation and its policy of leasing,\nnot selling, equipment.\n10See also American Optical Co. et al v. Shuron Optical Co., 9 F. 2d 932, 936.\n11There is always a question, however, whether it is in the public interest to give effect to\nan alleged prior invention that is suppressed to concealed or put aside and ignored. Does this\n\"promote the progress of useful arts\"? See, for example, Mason v. Hepburn, 84 O.G. 147.\n\nPatents in Action\n4.5\nHow Would Our Present Supreme Court Probably React to Bell's Patent?\nWhat might have been Bell's fate if he had to come before our Supreme Court\ntoday? We must assume, of course, that he had already obtained his patent,\nand had not already been worn out by interferences, in the Patent Office, with\none or more large corporations. As I shall show, later, such corporations have\nbeen notorious for provoking interferences by unwarrantably reading into one\nof their thousands of applications on file in the Patent Office an invention of an\noutsider that has come to their attention, and that they fear they might want to\nuse later. We must also assume that the patent has issued relatively promptly,\nso that well-financed copyists have not already been able to put the enterprising\ninventor out of business.\nFor purposes of analysis, we shall refer to the classic Supreme Court decision,\nJungerson v. Ostby and Barton Co.. 12 The Supreme Court threw out a patent\nfor an invention dealing with centrifuging wax into a mold for the purpose of\nintricately reproducing designs in jewelry and the like. It did this in the face of\nthe fact that this invention had made possible novel results that had long been\nsought by the whole industry, that it was slavishly copied, once made known,\nand that it was the first technique ever to reproduce accurately and intricately\nthis kind of jewelry. The Supreme Court held (p. 563):\nJungerson's process is nothing more that a refinement of a method\nknown as \"cere perdue\" or \"lost wax\" process, which was in use as\nearly as the sixteenth century. The treatises of Benvenuto Cellini\n. . .\nThe prior art, the Supreme Court said, has been there for over 400 years; all\none had to do was use it!\nLet us draw the parallel, in Bell's situation, to Reis's work some fifteen years\nbefore Bell, and Bourseul's writings some seven years before that, which told\nthe world that, if one caused the undulations of the air produced by sounds to\nproduce corresponding variations in electric current, and employed telegraph\ntype apparatus therefore, the telephone would be born. Does this not correspond\nto Cellini's telling the world in the sixteenth century that one can use wax models\nfor goldsmithing, and to what the Supreme Court, in the Jungerson case, termed\nthe recognition, by those skilled in the art, of the necessity for making \"molten\nmaterials fit snugly the intricate details of the mold\"?\nJungerson's invention, the Supreme Court held, was merely \"a refinement\"\nof Cellini's method, including an application of centrifugal force thereto. Cer\ntainly Jungerson did not discover centrifugal force! Bell's invention similarly\ncould have resulted as before explained, merely by \"a refinement\" of Reis's\napparatus by proper adjustment of Reis's screw h.\nScrew adjustments were\ncertainly recognized before Bell!\nThe Supreme Court made a point of the fact that \"those skilled in the\nart recognized and disclosed the necessity for the application of force\" - though\n12335 U.S. 560.\n\nCreate or Perish\nnot, of course, of Jungerson's particular successful centrifugal-force action in this\ntechnique, a fact which, however, the court found to be \"of no legal significance\"\n(p. 566).\nThat no one before had ever produced Jungerson's long-sought result, despite\nCellini's age-old teaching and the recognition that a force was required, was of\nno significance to the court. Why, then, should the fact that no one had attained\nBell's results, despite Bourseul's teaching, be of any more significance? Had not\nBourseul himself \"recognized and disclosed the necessity for the application of\"\nelectrical undulations that would correspond to the voice sounds?\nThe answer may lie in the dissent in the Jungerson case. Justice Frankfurter,\nadopting the words of dissent of Judge Learned Hand of the Court of Appeals\nbelow, pointed out (pp. 569-570).\nMy point is that, if there is a new combination, however trifling the\nphysical change may be, nothing more is required than that, to take\nthe step or steps, added \"invention\" is needed, and the \"invention,\"\nwhatever else it may be, is within the category of mental activities\nand of those alone. . . . Indeed it is the very basis of the defense that\nfor years all the elements lay open and available, and that nothing\nwas needed but the paltry modification which has proved so fruitful.\n. . . What better test of invention can one ask than the detection of\nthat which others had all along had a strong incentive to discover,\nbut had failed to see, though all the while it lay beneath their eyes?\nBut the time has long since passed when we can afford to engage in pretenses.\nThe real philosophy, it seems to me, is involved in Justice Jackson's honest\nappraisal in his dissent (p. 572).\nIt is the strong passion in this Court for striking them [patents] down\nso that the only patent that is valid is one which this Court has not\nbeen able to get its hands on.\nThe reader is left to speculate whether Bell, before our present Supreme\nCourt, would have had his patent sustained, whether, today, he would find back\ners who would invest in such a speculative, risky, and revolutionary business,\nknowing that ultimately it would probably receive this same kind of treatment\nat the hands of the court, and whether we could today build a private-industry\nAmerican Bell Telephone system, with the remarkable advances and services\nit provides and which foreign government-owned telephone companies cannot\nbegin to approach, let alone match.\n\nChapter 5\nThe Rights, Obligations, and Problems of\nInventors (Employee-Employer Relations)\nStrongly threaded through the fabric of the invention-innovation cy\ncle is the interplay between inventor and employer and between in\nventor and potential user or licensee. These relationships, including\ntypical industrial, university, and governmental contract provisions,\nare herein set forth. Because the appropriation of inventions is a dif\nficult matter to prove - though it happens every day - reference is\nmade to one of the very rare proven instances, one that took several\ndecades to resolve - the pioneer piezoelectric circuit inventions. This\nmay aid in forewarning the inventor of the pitfalls in his path and\nin encouraging business and government to recognize rather than to\ncircumvent or try to destroy the proprietary position of independent\ninventors.\nIn this era of conformity and considerable abdication of the right to negotiate\nemployment terms and conditions, engineers and applied scientists appear to\nknow little about their obligations to employers or to the firms who hire them\nas consultants, especially in the matter of inventions and patents. It may be\nin order, therefore, first to deal briefly with some general principles of law,\nand then to examine the policies of some of our leading institutions, industrial,\neducational, and governmental, as well as specific current contract provisions.\nWhether an agreement between an employer and an employee relating to the\ndisposition of patents and inventions is oral or in writing does not matter. Long\nago, in England, a so-called Statute of Frauds 1 was enacted for the purpose\nof preventing litigation in cases almost impossible to resolve, involving certain\nkinds of oral contracts. The plaintiffwould allege the terms of an oral agreement,\nand the defendant would deny those terms. There was no written evidence to\nprove the contentions of either side. How could the court resolve the dispute?\nThe Statute of Frauds, therefore, made certain kinds of contracts unenforceable,\nunless in writing. American law has adopted this Statute of Frauds, but an\n129 Chas. II.\n\nCreate or Perish\noral agreement in which an employee undertakes to assign his invention to his\nemployer is not included in the oral agreements that the courts will refuse to\nenforce under the Statute. They will enforce it if it can be proved to exist 2 .\nWhile an actual assignment of a patent must conform to a specific statutory\nprovision that requires a writing, the understanding between employer and em\nployee as to who is to own the invention or patent may be oral. Now, how do\nyou prove the oral agreement? One way is to examine the relation between and\nthe conduct of the parties, which may cast light upon the rights of the several\nparties. The mere relation of employer and employee does not, of itself, mean\nthat the employee is obligated to assign his invention to the employer.\nAs an illustration, if one is employed by a corporation as a sales engineer or as\na secretary, and makes inventions extremely useful to the employer, including,\neven, improvements upon the employer's products, those inventions are the\nemployee's property, in the absence of an understanding to the contrary. And it\nmakes no difference what kind of employer is involved. The employer may be a\ncorporation, an individual, a university, or the United States Government. The\nlast situation was decided by the Supreme Court 3:\nAn employee, performing all the duties assigned to him in his depart\nment of service, may exercise his inventive faculties in any direction\nhe chooses, with the assurance that whatever invention he may thus\nconceive and perfect is his individual property.\nWhy is this so? Perhaps the best answer is another illustration.\nLet us\nsuppose that a man is employed as a mill carpenter. He receives his salary in\nreturn for performing duties as a carpenter. It so happens, however, that he is\nobservant and thoughtful, and one day has an inspiration as to how to make a\nnew type of floor rack, which could well be used even in his employer's business.\nShould this invention belong to the employer for either legal or moral reasons?\nCertainly the employer did not include inventing as one of the carpenter's duties,\nand he certainly had not paid the carpenter for using his inventive abilities.\nNow this is the test. Was the employee being paid for the purpose of making\ninventions?\nWere his duties merely those of carpenter or was he employed\nspecifically to make inventions?\nIn just such a case the court held:\nIt is true that at the time he made and disclosed the invention to the\ndefendant, ... [he] was one of its employees. His work, however, was\nthat of mill carpenter. It had nothing whatever to do with floor racks\nor floor rack hinges. In no sense can it be said that his invention\nwas made in the course of his employment 4 .\nIf the understanding is that an employee is a sales engineer, a secretary,\na director, and that he is employed to perform the customary duties of such\n2Dalzell v. Dueber Manf. Co., 149 U.S. 315, 320.\n3Solomons v. U.S., 137 U.S. 342.\n4Massie v. Fruit Growers Express Co., 31 F. 2d 463, 466.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nemployment, this is not an understanding that the employee is expected to\ninvent. In the absence of further rights defined by contract between the parties,\nanything such an employee may invent is his own property, no matter how he\nwas stimulated to make the invention. This is the general rule of law.\nIt has previously been pointed out that sometimes government officials in\nthe United States think they should have special rights that others do not have.\nThis kind of tactic has been rejected by prior Supreme Courts 5:\nThe government has no more power to appropriate a man's property\ninvested in a patent than it has to take his property invested in real\nestate; nor does the mere fact that an inventor is at the time of his\ninvention in the employ of the government transfer to it any title to,\nor interest in it.\nThis is important, because we shall see very shortly what the government short\nsightedly demands today by way of special contract, both from direct employees\nand from people working under contract for the government.\nNow, let us consider a slightly different situation. Let us suppose another\ncase of an individual who is not employed for the purpose of inventing, but who\ndoes, nevertheless, make an invention. Assume, also, that he uses his employer's\nfacilities and the services of other fellow employees to perfect this invention. Is\nit still the inventor's property? Yes - but this time the employer is contributing\nsomething to further the invention. Under such circumstances, a so-called \"shop\nright\" for the employer is created: the employer acquires a nonexclusive, royalty\nfree, irrevocable, personal license to use the invention himself. He cannot give\nthis license to anyone else; it is personal with him, and he may use the invention\nroyalty-free. The invention, however, still belongs to the employee.\nConsider now a situation involving an employee of the United States Gov\nernment. The employee is a naval officer, and his duties involve devising plans\nto protect the Philippines. If he finds a method and apparatus for adapting\ntorpedoes to airplanes, the question arises whether his assigned duties implied\nmaking inventions such as this. If it does, the invention belongs to the govern\nment. At the very least, however, these facts\nestablish an irrevocable license in the government to the use of plain\ntiff's invention and patent 6 .\nIn another case 7, an industrial chemist employed by the Public Health\nService was relieved of his duties so that he might try to solve a particular\nproblem at the Edgewood Arsenal; but he was still paid his regular salary. This\nis not the case of an invention made by an employee whose duties of employment\ndo not contemplate conceiving and perfecting an invention. In such a case, the\ncourt reiterated, \"the rule is that the invention is the property of the employee.\"\nNor is this a case where the only claim of the employer arises out of the fact\n5See above, fn. 3.\n6Moffett v. Riske, 51 F. 2d 868, 870.\n7Houghton v. U.S., 23 F. 2d 386.\n\nCreate or Perish\nthat the employee used the property of his employer and the services of other\nemployees to develop his invention, and has assented to the employer's use of\nthe latter. Here, the court again reiterated, \"the invention is the property of\nthe employee, subject to an irrevocable license on the part of the employer to\nuse it\"; that is, a \"shop right.\"\nThe case presented here is rather that of an employee who makes an invention\nwhile employed to conduct experiments for the purpose of making it.\nThe\ncourt drew no distinction between work for the Public Health Service and that\nperformed at the Edgewood Arsenal and paid for by the government. Thus,\nconcluded the court,\nhe did merely that which he was being paid his salary to do. Un\nder such circumstances, we think there can be no doubt that his\ninvention is the property of his employer, the United States.\nIt is interesting to contrast this case with that involving two engineer em\nployees of the Radio Section of the Bureau of Standards 8 . These men were\nassigned to various radio-research projects for the government. They conceived\nan idea in the very same radio field that was of use in commercial equipment,\nnamely of constructing a power pack for operating from the mains to supply\nplate voltage for radio receivers without resort to B-batteries. They obtained\npatents for this invention and granted an exclusive license thereunder to the Du\nbilier Condenser Corporation, but reserving to the government a nonexclusive\nlicense, because of their use of government facilities for perfecting this inven\ntion. The government, believing that it was entitled to complete ownership of\nthe patents, not just a nonexclusive free license, brought suit to obtain a court\ndecree to such effect. As the court explained:\nThe United States is not content with such licenses and seeks in\nthese three suits ... to obtain a decree compelling the defendant's\nright, title, and interest in the patents.\nThe test applied by the court was whether or not the inventions arose as a result\nof the employment of the engineers to solve certain problems for the government.\nThe court concluded that their superior had given no specific instruction to\nengage in any research problem involving the inventions in controversy. That\nis the important point. While the engineers were instructed, as part of their\nemployment, to engage in certain research projects and problems in the radio\nfield, these had nothing to do with eliminating batteries in radios. The court\nfound, accordingly, that\nthe most that can be said is that Lowell and Dunmore were per\nmitted by Dr. Dellinger, after the inventions had been brought to\nhis attention, to pursue their work in the laboratory and perfect the\ninventions which had theretofore been made by them.\n8U.S. v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 49 F. 2d 306.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nThe court refused to hold that all patents of research workers in the Radio\nSection of the Bureau of Standards belong to the United States, unless there was\na special agreement. Only those patents dealing with inventions made within\nthe specific scope of the employment would become government property.\n5.1\nUniversity and Government Relations\nIn the light of these principles of law, it is in order to examine the manner in\nwhich various educational and business entities contract with their employees.\nConsider first Harvard University. Harvard has adopted the attitude, fully con\nsistent with the general law, that a student or a professor is not employed nor\ngiven facilities for the purpose of inventing, and so any inventions that he may\nmake become his own property, which he may do with as he desires. There is,\nhowever, one exception adopted under President Lowell's time under the impe\ntus of a certain unpleasantness in connection with the respirator invention of Dr.\nPhilip Drinker. No member of the university may now take out a patent that\nis concerned primarily with the field of public health or therapeutics without\nthe consent of the President and Fellow of Harvard College (the legal name of\nthe governing body of the university). While embarrassment may be created\nin other fields, apparently nothing is quite so touchy, from the public relations\nangle, as public health.\nIn connection with government contracts, however, Harvard's policy is con\nsiderably modified.\nThe United States Government requires in its contracts\nwith Harvard that the latter assume certain obligations, among them that its\nstaff and other people working at Harvard under government contracts shall\ngrant the government certain rights. The general Harvard-employee agreement,\nin connection with work under a government contract, commences as follows:\nIn order to enable Harvard University to fulfill its obligation under\nContract between the President and Fellows of Harvard College and\nthe United States Government and as a condition of my employment.\n...\nThen comes a term used over and over again in government contracts - \"sub\nject invention.\" Most government departments require that if, during the per\nformance of a contract, an employee under the contract conceives an invention\nfor the first time, or first actually reduces it to practice by constructing and\noperating it successfully under the contract, the government shall have a free\nright to practice that invention and to have the invention made for it by other\npeople. Hence, in this employee agreement, a so-called \"subject invention\" is\ndefined in the following terms:\nAny invention, improvement, or discovery (whether or not patentable)\nconceived or first actually reduced to practice by me ... either (A) in\nthe performance of work called for or required under said contract,\nor (B) in the performance of ... work ... which was done upon an\nunderstanding in writing that a contract would be awarded.\n\nCreate or Perish\nIn connection with such invention, the employee agrees and thereby grants\nto the United States Government irrevocable, nonexclusive, non\ntransferable and royalty-free license to practice, and cause to be\npracticed by or for the Government throughout the world, each\n\"Subject Invention.\"\nThe employee also agrees to disclose the invention promptly to his contracting\nofficer. Under this particular contract, the employee has an option 9 either to\nfile the patent application himself or to give the government the opportunity to\ndo so. The employee may thus have the commercial nongovernmental rights to\nhis invention if he exercises the first option.\nIt will be recalled that certain bars to obtaining a patent reside in the pub\nlication of the invention, or public use or sale in this country of the invention,\nmore than a year before the application is filed. Under this government con\ntract, therefore, the employee agrees to notify the project director, not later\nthan eight months after any such publication, public use, or sale of his inven\ntion, that he does not intend to file an application. The government will then\nhave four months in which to file an application, if so minded. Furthermore the\ngovernment demands the right to reproduce copyrightable material, data, plans,\nspecifications, without any interference whatsoever; and such rights are granted\ntogether with the patent licenses under these contracts. A similar agreement is\nexecuted by the project director himself, the terms of the employee agreement\nbeing directly incorporated by reference into his own.\nNow let us turn to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Institute\nhas a little different philosophy. It concurs with Harvard only to the extent that\ninventions or developments made by the staff members, and not related to any\nInstitute program of research with which the members may be concerned and\nto which the Institute does not contribute any funds,\nshall be the exclusive property of the individual producing the inven\ntion or development. The Institute will not construe the payment\nof salary or the provision of normal academic environment as con\nstituting grounds for equity by the Institute in such invention.\nFormerly, if a staff member or student made an invention in which the Insti\ntute had an equity, patent applications were usually filed through the Research\nCorporation of New York City, a nonprofit organization that endeavors to pro\nmote inventions in order to obtain funds for further research. Net income from\nthe inventions, after expenses, was divided equally between the Research Cor\nporation and the Institute, the latter employing such receipts to further its\nown educational and research policies. The inventor normally received 12 per\ncent of the gross royalties that the Research Corporation negotiated under the\ninvention.\nAt present, arrangements with the Research Corporation have been termi\nnated, and it remains to be seen what new policies will be adopted. The actual\n9Army, Navy, and Air Force contracts.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\npaucity of patents stemming from the millions of dollars spent in research at\nM.I.T. should cause consideration over the kind of policy that will stimulate\nthe staff to carry new discoveries and techniques to the patentable invention\nstage. As at Harvard, the Institute staff must execute the previously discussed\ninvention and copyright agreements, in connection with government contracts.\nA little different situation arises in connection with contracts with the Atomic\nEnergy Commission. It will be recalled that the law prohibits the granting of\npatents in the field of atomic energy when those patents relate primarily to the\nproduction of fissionable material, processes, or instrumentalities used in the\nproduction of such material, or in weapons themselves. Consequently, the AEC\ntakes a somewhat stronger position and declines to let the inventor himself file\nfor a patent. Instead, it claims the right to decide who shall own the invention.\nUnder an AEC patent clause, therefore, the following provision is set forth:\nWhenever any such invention or discovery results from such work\npaid for in whole or in part from Commission funds ... the Com\nmission shall have the sole power to determine whether or not and\nwhere a patent application shall be filed.\nEven if the contractor spends his own money under an AEC contract to make\nan invention, the AEC demands certain rights. Under those circumstances, the\nCommission\nshall retain at least a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license\nunder said invention, discovery, application for patent.\nUnder the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, the administra\ntor, through appropriate determinations and unless he waives the government's\nrights, is empowered to claim for the United States the exclusive right to inven\ntion under this program. If these restrictions remain, only history can record\nwhether American industry and the American inventor will be actually stimu\nlated and challenged by these provisions, or by the system of monetary awards\nfor significant scientific or technical contributions to aeronautical and space\nactivities, that Section 306 of the Act empowers the administrator to grant.\nRecent congressional hearings have not, in my view, resulted in any real change\nof attitude.\n5.2\nSummary of Current Governmental Agency Regulations Concerning Patents\nThe Department of Defense, as provided by Section IX of the Armed Services\nProcurement Regulations, acquires a royalty-free, nonexclusive license to make\nand have any inventions arising under its research and development contracts,\nand acquires no license or other patent rights on contracts involving the delivery\nof supplies or products. Similar policies govern contracts of the Veterans' Ad\nministration, the Post Office Department (which agrees not to use its license to\ncompete with the contractor or its commercial licensees), and the General Ser\nvices Administration. Under the Research and Marketing Act, the Department\n\nCreate or Perish\nof Agriculture requires that inventions resulting from its research and develop\nment contracts be either dedicated to the public or assigned to the government\nfor the issuance of royalty-free, nonexclusive licenses to qualified parties.\nThe Department of Health, Education and Welfare reserves the right of\nthe government to determine the ownership and the disposition of inventions\nflowing from its research and development contracts. In the case of industrial\nresearch contracts in the field of cancer chemotherapy, on the other hand, the\nright to patent may be left with the contractor, but with that right vested in\nthe Surgeon General to protect the public interest, as, for example, by assuring\nroyalty-free, nonexclusive licenses to own the public.\nNonprofit institutional\ncontractors may also own patents on inventions arising under a research and\ndevelopment contract, subject to stipulations necessary to protect the public\ninterest.\nWhile the Department of the Interior has a present policy of attempting\nto have patents assigned to the government, it will, in the case of recalcitrant\ncontractors, accept a royalty free, irrevocable, nonexclusive license. The Depart\nment of Commerce also follows a flexible course as to whether the government is\nto own patents or obtain a royalty-free nonexclusive license. In the case of Mar\nitime Administration research and development contracts, the same provision is\napplied to marine research, but the patent provisions of the Atomic Energy Act\nof 1946, as amended, are employed where nuclear material or atomic energy is\ninvolved. That Act, under which the Atomic Energy Commission also operates,\nrequires the retention by the government of the sole power to determine and\ndispose of patent rights.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, previously alluded to, was\nmodeled after the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, as amended, and requires even\nmore broadly that the Administration itself shall be deemed to have made or\nconceived any invention or discovery \"made or conceived under any contract,\nsubcontract, arrangement, or other relationship with the Administrator, regard\nless of whether the contract or arrangement involved the expenditure of funds by\nthe Administrator.\"\nMerely discussing an idea with the Administrator would, if this Space Act\nprovision is literally interpreted, be a \"relationship\" or \"arrangement\" that\nwould vest all rights in the government.\nIt is small wonder that many rep\nresentatives of American industry, science, and law have protested this wording\nof the statute 10, and that proposed revisions are under consideration. Indeed,\nthe principal finding of a recent thorough two-year study by the Denver Re\nsearch Institute is that only negligible commercial inventions have spun offfrom\nthe multi-million-dollar NASA research programs: about six patent applications\nfiled each year of the life of NASA for developments from NASA-funded con\ntracts. How long does government have to wait to learn that few companies\nwith real competence and backbone will produce under this kind of so-called\nstimulus?\n10\"Property Rights and Inventions made under Federal Space Research Contracts,\" Hearings\nbefore the House Subcommittee on Patents and Scientific Inventions of the Committee on\nScience and Astronautics, 85th Congress, 1st Session (1959).\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nAn analogy to Soviet philosophy is striking evident, as discussed in a Con\ngressional report on proposed revisions 11:\nContrasts were drawn between the American patent system and its\noperation, on the one hand, and the Soviet patent system and its\nmethod of operation, on the other. The argument goes about as\nfollows: Whereas the American patent system depends upon free\nand open competition for commercial markets, the Soviet system\ndepends upon a determination by the Government as to the eco\nnomic or commercial necessity of producing an article as a basis for\nits industrial operation. There is some similarity between the so-\ncalled patents of the Soviet system and the wording of sections 305\nand 306 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (which\nare substantially the same as patent and compensation or award\nprovisions of the Atomic Energy Act). The Government ownership\nprovisions of the NASA and AEC statutes, if carried out literally,\nwould correspond to the \"public patents\" provision of the Soviet\nsystem in that there can be no private commercialization of the in\nventions with Government approval. The \"compensation or award\"\nprovisions of the NASA and AEC statutes correspond to the \"private\npatent\" provisions of the Russian system in that the inventor will\nnot be rewarded unless the Government allows commercialization or\nuse of the invention in the interest of the public.\n5.3\nIndustrial Employment Agreements\nLet us now turn to industrial organizations. Two typical illustrations of employer\nemployee contracts are provided by the General Electric Company and the Radio\nCorporation of America. The General Electric Company does not treat invent\ning engineers as a class separate from other employees. It provides a sweeping\nprovision \"in consideration of my employment in any capacity\" If one wants\nthe position, therefore, he agrees that \"all inventions made or conceived by me\n. . . from the time of entering the Company's employ until I leave\" will be the\nsole and exclusive property of General Electric. There is a qualification, how\never. Only two fields of invention are so included, namely inventions which are\nalong the \"lines of business, work or investigations of the Company . . . or which\nresult from or are suggested by any work which I may do for or on behalf of\nthe Company.\" The employee then agrees to assist GE in obtaining the patent\nand to keep adequate written records of the invention, the records to remain\nthe property of the company.\nAnother important clause covers matters with which a company, as distin\nguished from a university, is vitally concerned. Some things, as I have previously\nnoted, are not susceptible of patent protection, or there is no purpose in patent\ning them. Know-how and trade secrets are in this category. The general rule\n11\"Proposed Revisions to the Patent Section, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958,\"\nmarch 8, 1960 (Mimeo).\n\nCreate or Perish\nis that a confidential relationship exists between employer and employee, and\nthat the employee is not free to disclose trade secrets, even after leaving the\nemployer.\nIn an interesting recent case, for example, the makers of Rise instant shaving\ncream, the Carter Company, sued the Colgate Company for patent infringement\nand for unfair competition in hiring one of the key employees (the inventor)\naway from the Carter Company and using the trade secrets that the employee\nhad acquired 12 . The court not only sustained the patent, but also awarded\nattorney's fees and costs because of the wanton character of Colgate's action in\nhiring away an employee and using trade secrets that he had obtained in his\nprior employment.\nIn order to have this protection in writing, and not be compelled to rely\non the general rule alone, however, the General Electric Company employment\nagreement states that, as a condition of employment, the employee agrees \"not\nto disclose at any time either during or subsequent to my employment, any in\nformation, knowledge or data of the Company . . . relating to formulas, business\nprocesses, methods, machines, manufactures, compositions, inventions, discov\neries or otherwise, which is of a secret or confidential nature 13.\"\nIn the second example, the corresponding employment agreement of the\nRadio Corporation of America does not apply to all employees. The patent\nagreement is restricted to employment in a capacity where the employee is\n\"reasonably expected to make new contributions and inventions.\" So if one is\nemployed as a janitor or a secretary at RCA, he still has the common-law right\nto inventions, even if stimulated by what he has seen in the RCA laboratory.\nThe employee who is expected to invent agrees to assign all inventions, made\nduring employment, that relate to the business or interests of the company,\nor that result from tasks assigned by the company. In order to safeguard its\nobligations under government contracts, however, RCA requires that even if it\nemploys a person in an occupation where he is not expected to invent, and where\nthere is normally no obligation to assign inventions, RCA obtains rights under\ntwo exceptions; if the employment is under a government contract, and if the\nwork is intended to lead to the granting of a government contract. The RCA\nagreement, like that of other companies, excludes all inventions made prior to\nemployment with the company.\nA few words now about the way in which the employer compensates the\ninventor for his inventions. Recently a very liberal policy was reported to have\nbeen adopted by a relatively small company 14, that not only pays a token\nsum of $25 when patent application is filed and another $50 when the patent\nis granted, but also agrees to pay to the employee, as a stimulus to invention,\nroyalties starting with 10 per cent of the net cash royalties that may come from\nlicensing others. Most companies, of course, have no such policy. GE pays a\nbonus of $100, partly in cash and party in company stock, upon the filing of the\n12Carter v. Colgate Palmolive Company, 230 F. 2d 855.\n13The terms \"confidential\" and \"secret\" are used in the ordinary sense and not in the\ngovernment security sense.\n14Electronic Manufacturing (a monthly newssheet), Oct., 1957, p. 115.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\napplication. RCA also pays $100 upon the filing of the application. This is based\nupon the belief that it is frequently impossible to determine what important\ncontributions may have been made to the development by employees other than\nthose whom the law identifies as \"inventors.\" To attempt to approximate an\nevaluation for \"inventions\" only and to make individual payments based on\nsuch evaluations to \"inventors\" could, it is stated, result in inequities and could\nhamper team play, a result which, in turn, would slow down progress. Instead,\nreward comes at GE by promotion in position and salary.\nAnother interesting topic is the situation when engineers and applied scien\ntists approach outside companies, asking them to consider ideas and inventions\nwith a possible view to negotiating a license agreement. Two illustrations will\nsuffice to show the reason for the present attitude of the large companies.\nAn individual suggested an advertising idea to the manufacturer of Chester\nfield cigarettes, indicating that he expected reasonable compensation if the com\npany used it. The company never replied, but several years later its advertising\nagency, which purportedly had never seen the submitter's idea, hit upon a very\nsimilar proposal. The company adopted this proposal and was thereupon sued\nby the original submitted for misappropriation of his idea. A sizable jury verdict\nfor the plaintiff was sustained by the Supreme Court of Indiana.\nThe second case is that of a manufacturer of three-way light bulbs. In order\nto avoid adverse publicity, and because it was difficult to prove independent\nconception, it settled a suit out of court for a reported $150,000 with a stranger\nto it, but who had some years earlier voluntarily sent it a similar idea.\nIn order to protect themselves, therefore, many companies will absolutely\nrefuse to receive any disclosures from outsiders, unless the disclosure is covered\nby a filed patent application, or unless the submitter agrees that there is no\nconfidential relation involved in the disclosure and that he will rely upon his\npatent rights alone. Only under these conditions will these companies receive\nfor examination an outsider's invention.\n5.4\nThe Problems and Dangers in Negotiation - One of the Rare Proven Cases\nThe dangers inherent in making such disclosure need examination, however, as\nwell as the shameful record of certain large companies in dealing improperly\nwith eminent men of science and of the engineering profession, in order that the\nrisks involved may be understood.\nProfessor Frederick V. Hunt describes some of these risks in resume form\n15 . His account, which constitutes an important part of the history of radio,\nwill now be supplemented by additional information relating to past experiences\nin connection with inventions submitted to the Western Electric Company and\nto the International Telephone and Telegraph Company. These are among the\nvery, very few instances where such conduct was actually exposed; and even\nhere it took several decades to prove.\nWe shall begin with the piezoelectric crystal and circuit inventions of Pro\nfessor Walter G. Cady, formerly of Wesleyan University. Dr. Cady's name is\n15Frederick V. Hunt, Electroacoustics, pp. 23 - 25.\n\nCreate or Perish\nextremely well known in the electronics field as one of the pioneers in stabiliz\ning electric oscillations with the aid of quartz crystals. During World War I,\nhe was one of a number of American scientists engaged in trying to solve the\nsubmarine problem. He heard about the work of Professor Paul Langevin, in\nFrance, who had found that he could employ Curie's discovery of piezoelectric\nity for submarine detection: if sound energy from a submarine strikes a quartz\nplate, the piezoelectric effect will produce a small voltage that can be detected.\nConversely, if an alternating voltage is applied to the crystal, the crystal will\nbe forced to vibrate and to transmit sound into the water. This was the kind\nof apparatus with which Cady and a number of others were concerned at New\nLondon.\nAfter the war, Cady continued his investigations with these quartz devices\nand made several inventions which were lumped together into two patents 16 .\nWhen it was appreciated that more than one invention actually was involved in\neach of these patents, applications for so-called \"reissue patents\" were filed.\nA reissue patent may be granted under the following circumstances. If one\nhas, through inadvertence, made a mistake in his patent, or has failed to appre\nciate or understand the true scope of the invention, he may in certain instances\nrefile that patent. This does not result in extending the patent \"monopoly\"\nsince the reissue patent dates from the issue of the original patent, but at least\nthe patentee will have an accurate patent.\nThis is what happened to Cady, so that his original patents were released as a\ngroup of reissue patents 17 . Included in these inventions were what have become\nknown as the crystal stabilizer and the crystal-controlled oscillator. Figure 6\nshows in Fig. 3 of the patent drawing an electron tube 4 having an input tuned\ncircuit comprising coil 7 and condenser 9 and an output circuit having a coil\n8 coupled to the coil 7 to form an \"Armstrong oscillator,\" the frequency of\nwhich is controlled primarily by the values of the coils and the condenser. Cady\ndiscovered that if a piece of quartz were connected into this circuit at 12, then,\nin a very narrow range of adjustment of this oscillating circuit, a phenomenon\ntook place in the circuit (region 4 in Figs. 5 and 6 of the patent drawing) where\nthe crystal seemed to lock the frequency. If the condenser 9 was adjusted a bit\nfurther, the crystal lost control, so that the crystal could stabilize the oscillator\nonly over a very limited range. That is the stabilizer invention.\nCady also found that if he employed a long bar of quartz, as shown at 12 in\nFig. 2, connecting one end of the quartz to the input 1-4 of the first tube of a\ntrain of amplifiers and the other end of the quartz to the output 5 of the last\namplifier, the quartz bar 12 would itself mechanically couple energy between\noutput and input, and sustain oscillations without the use of coils and con\ndensers, and at a frequency controlled and determined by the dimensions of the\n16U.S. Patents Nos. 1,450,246 (April 3, 1923) and 1,472,583 (Oct. 30, 1923).\n17Reissue Patents Nos.\n17,245 (four-electrode crystal stabilizer); 17,246 (four-electrode\ncrystal oscillator); 17,247 (crystal stabilizer for \"Armstrong\" oscillator); 17,355 (piezoelectric\ncrystal resonator); 17,356 (piezoelectric crystal wavemeter); 17,357 (crystal resonator cou\npled to another medium); 17,358 (filter embodying piezoelectric crystal); and 17,358 (crystal\nresonator coupling two circuits).\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nbar of quartz. In view of the inherent necessary size of the four-electrode crystal\nbar, the frequency of oscillations was not very high. This was, nonetheless, the\nfirst crystal-controlled oscillator. Drawing of Cady's patent.\nFig. 5.1: Cady's patent drawing.\n(This image is public domain and is not\nprotected by copyright.)\n\nCreate or Perish\nAnd so, very excited about these developments, Cady went to the logical\ncorporate giants in the field of communications and solicited the interest of\nthe American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Western Electric\nCompany, Inc., in his inventions. He freely disclosed all of his patent application,\npermitted the company engineers, including his former student, H. D. Arnold,\nthe director of research, to visit his laboratory at Wesleyan University on several\noccasions, and freely gave the company samples of his apparatus. Cady expected\nthat the company was evaluating this material in order to decide whether or\nnot to use his invention and thus to take a license. Let us see, however, the\ndilemma in which Cady soon found himself.\nOnly recently has it been admitted 18 that, as far back as June 1924,\nthe American Telephone and Telegraph Company began utilizing a quartz-\ncrystal oscillator to obtain constant-frequency oscillations for a radio trans\nmitter. Cady's affidavit in the record before the District Court in Pierce v.\nAmerican Communications Company, Inc.. 19 says:\nThe engineers of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company\nand Western Electric Company, Incorporated, concealed this fact\nfrom me, and, on the contrary, led me to believe that piezoelectric\ncrystals were not of any commercial value to them.\nThe letters Cady has received appear as Plaintiff's Exhibit CXXI in this\nsuit. They state that the company had no interest in the inventions, though the\nfacts now show that they had already appropriated them, unknown to Cady.\nAs if this were not enough, Cady continues:\nI was suddenly plunged into the said Interference 50, 545, Cady v.\nNicolson, under the claim that the said Alexander McLean Nicolson\nhad made all three of my inventions . . . long before I did 20 .\nAnd Cady further stated that this interference was based upon claims that\nwere copied in exactly the form that they were in at the time I gave\nsaid copies of my patent applications to Dr. Arnold, in 1921.\n\"Concealment\" and \"interference\" were thus the rewards that this eminent man\nof science received from this gigantic company with which he had been dealing\nfrankly and freely.\nNow, on what basis did the Western Electric and American Telephone and\nTelegraph attorneys claim that Nicolson had made these inventions? The record\nshows that, upon Arnold's return from a Washington conference in 1917, where\nthe work of Langevin with piezoelectric crystals had been disclosed by the French\nand British to a group of American scientists, Nicolson was set upon the problem\nof developing Langevin's work. He did make some original contributions with\n18Raymond A. Heising, Quartz Crystals for Electrical Circuits, Van Nostrand, 1946.\n19111 F. Supp. 181.\n20Nicolson was an engineer in the employ of Western Electric Company, Inc.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nRochelle salt crystals as Hunt's account explained 21 . Figure 7 shows part of\nNicolson's original patent, the application for which was filed April 10, 1918.\n21Frederick V. Hunt, Electroacoustics. p. 52.\n\nCreate or Perish Drawing from part of Nicolson's original patent.\nFig. 5.2: A part of Nicolson's original patent.\nClaim 12 reads, \"Means for\ntranslating acoustical energy into electrical energy, a space current device hav\ning a control member, and a connection between said means and said device,\nsaid means comprising a substance capable of generating electromotive force in\nresponse to a change in pressure.\" (This image is public domain and is not\nprotected by copyright.)\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nIn Fig. 12 of the patent, a Rochelle salt crystal 53 is placed in a tunnel near the\nenemy trench. The crystal is connected to a pair of earphones 54 so that the en\nemy movements can be detected. As one modification, the crystal may modulate\nan alleged electric oscillator (Fig. 11 of the patent), and an antenna may trans\nmit the oscillation signals to a remote receiver, instead of using wires between\nthe Rochelle salt crystal picking up vibrations and the earphones. That was\nNicolson's original case. One of his first claims (12) specified the combination of\ncrystal means comprising a substance capable of generating electromotive force\nin response to a change of pressure for translating acoustical energy into electri\ncal energy, the space-current oscillator tube 50, and a connection between the\ntranslating means and the tube. But how can this possibly bear upon Cady's\ncrystal-controlled oscillator, where the crystal is used not to pick up sounds,\nbut, on the contrary, to determine and generate the oscillation frequency itself?\nHow can there be an interference?\nThe American Telephone and Telegraph attorneys, having inspected Cady's\npatent applications before permitting the Nicolson patent to issue, split this Fig.\n11 out, and made it the subject matter of a so-called \"divisional applications.\"\nThat is, where there is more than one invention disclosed in an application,\nthe additional invention may be divided out and made the subject matter of a\nseparate application, being, however, entitled to the filing date of the original\napplication. So the American Telephone and Telegraph Company now had an\napplication with an early 1918 filing date, showing an oscillator and a crys\ntal, though, in the words of Judge Ford, in the case of Pierce v. American\nCommunications Company, Inc., the original Nicolson disclosure\nshows only the use of the crystal as the equivalent of a telephone\ntransmitter or a microphone. He teaches nothing about the control\nof the frequency of the oscillations.\nArmed with an effective early-date application showing an oscillator and a\ncrystal, irrespective of its operation as originally described and intended, the\nAmerican Telephone and Telegraph attorneys copied Cady's claims from his\npatent applications, and so provoked the before-mentioned interference.\nAs\nJudge Ford pointed out, it was not until \"after Cady had made his disclosures\"\nthat the Nicolson circuit allegedly became a crystal-controlled oscillator.\nSo Professor Cady found himself enmeshed in a legal contest with the gi\nant American Telephone and Telegraph. He thereupon sold out to the Radio\nCorporation of America. Hunt explains how, through improper handing, the\nclaims that belonged to Professor Cady were later awarded to Nicolson. Thus,\none finds in the Nicolson patent the claims for Cady's invention, namely a de\nvice where the circuit is stably nonoscillatory when not under the control of\nthe crystal vibrator, and where the frequency of oscillations, when the system\noscillates, is stably determined by the frequency of vibration of the vibrator.\nThe significance of that improper handling is evident from Judge Ford's later\ndetermination in Pierce v. American Communications Company, Inc.\nIndeed it appears that although Nicolson may have believed he had\n\nCreate or Perish\na crystal-controlled oscillator, in fact he did not. Professor Cady\nshowed by his later experiments with the Nicolson circuit that os\ncillations were not controlled by the crystal but were determined by\nthe other elements of the circuit. The evidence of Professor Edward\nL. Bowles' affidavit is to the effect that the function of the crystal in\nthe Nicolson circuit is to modulate the oscillations (the only function\nhe originally claims for them, and the basis for his earlier patent)\nand not to control their frequency.\nDefendant has introduced pages from Nicolson's note book written\nin 1918 . . . Dr. F. W. Kranz, who signed these pages as witness,\ntestified that Nicolson at that time said nothing to indicate he had\ndiscovered that crystals could be used to control the frequency of the\noscillations, nor did Nicolson make any such claim when he originally\nfiled his application in 1918.\n5.5\nProfessor Cady Was Not Alone\nThe A T & T, however, was not partial only to Professor Cady.\nTake the\napplication of Professor Langevin, who was thousands of miles away in France.\nLangevin's application showed a quartz crystal driven by alternating-current os\ncillations in a coil to generate sounds. Conversely, sound waves striking the crys\ntal would be converted into electric energy and received. This was Langevin's\ninvention.\nSo into the Nicolson application went a claim reading, \"An oscillating cir\ncuit comprising a piezoelectric device.\" This is, of course, what Langevin had\ninvented. An interference was declared. Langevin complained that French rep\nresentatives, Majors M. Fabry and H. Abraham, had disclosed his invention to\na whole group of scientists, including Dr. Arnold and others of the Western\nElectric Company, as before mentioned, before Nicolson's 1918 filing date. But\nagain A T & T prevailed. Nicolson was awarded priority, because Langevin's\nlong-distance stipulated proofs were not technically sufficient. Thus, the Court\nof Customs and Patent Appeals 22 ruled:\nThe record in the case so far as the testimony on behalf of both par\nties is concerned is very informal and very unsatisfactory . . . deficiency\noccasioned by an inferior record.\nThe court was forced to reject as unproved the facts of the actual disclosure at\nthe 1917 Washington meetings (as testified to by Professor Cady in Pierce v.\nAmerican Communications Company, Inc). In the court's words, quoting the\nBoard of Appeals,\nWhether or not Langevin had the invention or had imparted knowl\nedge of it to Fabry or Abraham, the fact remains that no documen\ntary evidence has been produced showing what was disclosed at the\nWashington meeting.\n22110 F. 2d 687, 690.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nIt is extremely significant that the A T & T and Western Electric attorneys\ndid not use Dr. Frederick W. Kranz, formerly of their employ, as a witness in\nthis interference. Dr. Kranz's statement in Pierce v. American Communications\nCompany, Inc., is most revealing:\nIn 1918, Nicolson and I occupied adjoining desks. . . . I recall a con\nference at the laboratory about 1917 in the course of which Dr.\nCrandall informed us of the work of Professor Paul Langevin, of\nFrance, involving the use of piezoelectric crystals as sound transmit\nters and receivers. . . .\nHaving been successful in appropriating the inventions of Professors Cady\nand Langevin, why should not A T & T attempt to appropriate the commercially\npractical and most important crystal-controlled oscillator inventions of the late\nProfessor George Washington Pierce, former Rumford Professor of Physics and\nGordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics at Harvard? The Pierce oscillator\nis of two principal types (Figure 8): first, as shown in Fig. 2 of the patent,\nan appropriate two-electrode crystal 2 connected between the grid 26 and the\nanode or plate 30 of the electron tube 24; and, secondly (Fig. 11 of the patent),\nthe two electrode crystal 2 connected between the grid 28 and the filament or\ncathode 26.\nBut Nicolson's mammoth Rochelle salt crystal for responding to sound waves\nhas at least three electrical connections and one can trace some kind of connec\ntion to each of the tube electrodes. Why, therefore, should not Pierce's inven\ntion, too, be claimed by Western Electric on the basis of the Nicolson application\nand by A T & T on the basis of an application of an A T & T engineer, Bail\nery? So A T & T copied Pierce's claims and provoked interferences. This time,\nhowever, it came up against an applied scientist who was prepared to fight in\ndefense of his rights.\nThere were years of litigation which finally culminated in victory for Pierce\n23 . When it appeared that Bailey was beaten, Western Electric urged Nicolson\nas the prior inventor. Pierce's attorney took the position that A T & T and\nWestern Electric were really the same company, the former owning more than\n98 per cent of the stock of the latter. He set out to prove that they had the\nsame management control and were, in effect, the same entity. Therefore, since\nPierce had beaten Bailey (A T & T), he was not compelled to have another suit\nagainst Western Electric on the Nicolson application. The contention was that\nthe matter was res judicate - decided, once and for all. Not long after, an A T\n& T attorney, George E. Folk, visited Cambridge, thrust out his hand, and said\nto Professor Pierce, \"Call me George.\"\nWhen the basic Pierce oscillator patent issued, Professor Pierce carefully\nclaimed therein only what represented his advance over Cady and he would\ntake no claim broad enough to dominate Cady, though I am informed that as a\nresult of the settlement with A T & T he could have had any of the oscillator\nclaims that later issued in the Nicolson patent.\n23Interference 67, 863, Pierce v. Bailey v. Nicolson.\n\nCreate or Perish\nThe Western Electric Company Nicolson patent then issued, with Langevin's\nclaims and Cady's claims, and, for years A T & T used this patent as a club to\ncollect royalties on every crystal-controlled oscillator - collect, that is, except\nfrom those who knew the real meaning of the Nicolson patent.\nLet me give an illustration. Claim 1 of the Nicolson patent that was taken\nfrom Professor Langevin, reads: \"An oscillating circuit comprising a piezoelec\ntric device.\" This claim, in its true history, refers to Langevin's idea of having\nan oscillating circuit drive a crystal. It has nothing to do with a crystal control\nling the oscillations itself. And yet, in their licensing policy, the A T & T has\nread this, or tried to read this, on crystal-controlled oscillators. This is what is\nknown as \"verbal infringement.\" The words of the claim sound as if one were\ninfringing, but the meaning of the claim, as shown by the file history, is not the\nsame thing. There is, therefore, no infringement. I stress this point because\nvery often one cannot tell, merely by reading the claims of a patent, what they\nactually cover.\nIn rewriting history a few years ago, through the eyes of the Telephone Com\npany 24, an effort was made to try to evolve the Pierce oscillator from Nicolson's\nmaze of crystal-modulator connections. In Pierce v. American Communications\nCompany, Inc., however, Professor Edward L. Bowles discussed\nthe circuit diagrams of page 15 of the Heising text which are labeled\n\"Nicolson's oscillator circuit.\" In the interest of accuracy, I point\nout that the alleged Nicolson circuit and its variations shown on\npage 15 do not either accord or agree with the Nicolson circuit of\npatents 1,495,429, filed April 10, 1918; and the alleged divisional\npatent directed to Fig. 11, 2,212,845, filed April 23, 1923. This is\nclear from a mere cursory inspection.\nProfessor Bowles explained the details of this and, as stated by Judge Ford,\nshowed\nthat although Nicolson may have believed he had a crystal-controlled\noscillator, in fact he did not.\nJudge Ford found, moreover, that\nNicolson still shows the same whole Rochelle salt crystal of his earlier\npatent, with three electrodes arranged so as to operate as two pairs\nof electrodes. . . . The Pierce oscillator is so designed as to oscillate\nonly at the frequency determined by the crystal, the presence of\nwhich is necessary if the system is to oscillate at all. Nicolson, on\nthe other hand, while claiming that his system may oscillate at a\nfrequency determined by the natural frequency of the crystal and\nunder the control of the crystal, is also careful to point out that by\nproper use of reactances it may also be made to oscillate at some\n24See above, fn. 19.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nother frequency than that determined by the crystal. Clearly, this\ndoes not purport to be the same thing as the Pierce oscillator.\n. . . Defendant . . . argues that in 1918 Nicolson had already hit upon\nthe circuit which Pierce later patented. But these only show that\nin 1918 he was working on circuits which may superficially resemble\nthat of Pierce, as do those, for instance, of his earlier patent, which,\nhowever, discloses only a different function and mode of operation of\nthe crystal. . . . These pages furnish no warrant for a conclusion that\nNicolson in 1918 had anticipated what Pierce was later to discover.\nI should now like to recount, apropos of the plight of scientists when bringing\ninventions to our corporate manufacturers, the latest pronouncement relating\nto such activity, this time in connection with the International Telephone and\nTelegraphy Company. And the same Professor Pierce was involved. The deci\nsion is reported in Pierce v. International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation\n25 . Judge Hartshorne of the District Court for the District of New Jersey found\nthat\nFollowing Pierce's patent applications in the 1920's or early 1930's,\nPierce at I T & T's request, not only opened up his secret papers to\nI T & T for their examination anent the possibility of its taking out\na license thereunder, but he also permitted I T & T's representatives\nto visit his laboratory. In the complaint and at the trial the question\nwas raised as to whether Pierce's disclosures were confidential and\nwhether such confidence had been breached by I T & T.\nThe court went on to tell the kind of tactics that I T & T promoted:\nI T & T doubtless used every possible means to secrete its circuit\ndiagrams from Pierce, who had so freely showed I T & T all he knew\nabout his invention.\nAnd again:\nHere we must bear in mind that, as seen above, I T & T had acted\nin a peculiarly secretive manner, particularly with respect to the\nman who, in previous years, had given it every assistance, in the\nform of access to secret documents and in personal visitations and\nconferences at his laboratory.\n5.6\nConclusion\nThe dilemma facing the inventor who discloses inventions to outside organiza\ntions is thus pointed up by the typical (but rarely proved) specific experiences\njust recounted. The law, as presently applied, is inadequate; and something\nmust be done more properly to protect the rights of inventors.\n25147 F. Supp. 934.\n\nCreate or Perish\nIn the next chapter, I shall discuss some of the proposals before Congress for\nimproving the patent system and the enforcement of patents by the courts. If\nan effective program can be activated, our corporate giants may be more wary\nabout appropriating the inventions of others and wearing the inventors down by\ncostly and vexatious litigation.\nJudge Wyzanski, of the Massachusetts Federal District Court, in connection\nwith Professor Rudenberg's electron-microscope patent 26, deplored the condi\ntion of \"the individual holder of patents\" who is\nat the mercy of large corporate enterprises which could use the in\nvention, decline to accept the inventor's reasonable offers, allow him\nto sue for infringement and in the end, if beaten in the infringement\nsuit, pay him not even a royalty high enough to cover the expenses\nof the litigation.\nTo similar effect are the words of Judge Hayes of the District Court for the\nMiddle District of North Carolina 27:\nThe result is not encouraging to an inventor. Indeed a patent, how\never valid and however flagrantly infringed, would be worthless in\nthe hands of a person with small means if it had to survive the ob\nstacles which have confronted the patent in suit. This is battle by\nthe defense to ignore the patents until a court of last resort compels\na course otherwise.\nSo the time has come for frank talk. If Congress, in these precarious times,\nis anxious to encourage inventors (and I have tried to show herein that many\nof the important advances have come and still do come from individual inven\ntors entirely outside established research laboratories and organizations), then\nCongress must make the inventor more secure at the hands of the potential\ninfringers and in the courts.\n26Rudenberg v. Clark, 81 F. Supp. 42, 45.\n27Davis Co. v. Baker-Cammack Hosiery Mills, Inc., 86 F.

(This image is public domain and is not\nprotected by copyright.)\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 6\nThe Future of American Patents\nRecent proposals for improving the patent system are discussed, in\ncluding conflicting philosophies in Congress and in the courts.\nA number of proposals have been made to Congress for consideration as\nbases for possible future legislation which may improve the patent system and its\noperation. They may also undo what the courts and other governmental agencies\nhave done to dishearten and discourage both inventors and persons with venture\ncapital, from taking a bolder approach in exploiting and developing new fields,\nunless under government direction or some other inherently restricting and ofter\nunimaginative sponsorship.\n6.1\nPrevious Suggested Improvements in the Patent System\nAmong the scientists who have been active in the field of patents is Vannevar\nBush, wartime director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development. Dr.\nBush, a number of other scientists, and lawyers haven the initiative in trying\nto recover and increase, in this country, fertile ground for invention and a more\nrapid progress in the development of the useful arts. To this end, an analysis\nand series of proposals has been provided in a study for the Subcommittee on\nPatents of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary 1 .\nUnfortunately, as will later be evident, I do not agree that the underlying\nproblems can be solved by the principal proposals that have been advanced; but\nthe proponents are to be commended for their initiative, purpose, and sincere\neffort. As part of constructive criticism, moreover, substitute proposals will be\noffered, which I believe can effectively reverse the present unhealthy trend in the\noperation of the patent system. The role of the applied scientist and engineer\nin helping to reverse those trends will also be discussed.\n1Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Study 1, p.\n18.\n84th\nCongress, 2d Session (1958). It should also be noted that the Patent Office would still not be\nequipped to investigate prior use or sale, which are other bars to a \"valid\" patent grant.\n\nCreate or Perish\n6.2\nThe Search\nOne of the factors treated in Dr. Bush's study is the inherent lack of thorough\nness of the search in the Patent Office as to the possible novelty of invention, as\na result of (1) limitations in material to be searched and methods of searching,\n(2) the relatively small examining corps, (3) the limited budget for Patent Of\nfice operations, and (4) the limited time that can be given to each case by an\nexaminer. The thoroughness with which examiners search the prior-art patents\nand publications, and on the basis of which they decide whether or not to grant\na patent, is really not well controlled, though it represents an excellent compro\nmise in the light of the above mentioned limitations.\nDr. Bush and others feel that, if this search were improved to make it more\nthorough and exhaustive, the courts would perhaps give more weight to patents,\nand would not be so readily disposed to throw them out. These men propose\nlarger appropriations from Congress, increased classification and subclassifica\ntion in the Patent Office to insure that the examiner will not miss anything\npertinent, a much more complete examination of literature and of patents, both\ndomestic and foreign, and the installation of computers and other data-handling\nmachines further to assist the examiner. While there can be no objection to at\ntempting to improve the searching procedure and thereby make more nearly\ncertain that the patents that issue will be for really new concepts, I believe it\nis impossible to attain Dr. Bush's expressed hope \"to insure that the patents\nwhich it [the Patent Office] issues are in fact valid 2.\" This statement, made\nalso by some lawyers, appears to ignore the fact that \"validity\" is not arrived\nat by entering two and two into a machine, turning a crank to energize a logic-\nsequence operation, and obtaining an answer of four.\nThe law says that a patent is presumed to be valid. This is, however, no\ndifferent from the presumption in any other branch of the law. It means that,\nif an inventor comes into court as plaintiff after being granted a patent follow\ning reasonable investigation, the burden of offering evidence to overcome the\npresumption of validity is placed upon the defendant's shoulders. But the hope\nthat the search had been so thorough that a truly \"valid\" patent had resulted\nignores the fact that rarely does the prior art disclose the complete device for\nwhich the patent was granted. The \"validity\" of the patent grant more gener\nally rests upon the opinion of the court as to whether or not what was done\nrepresented an obvious extension of the prior art that the ordinary mechanic\nskilled in the art would have accomplished. The examiner had the opinion that\nthe advance was not obvious, or within the ordinary mechanic's ability to cre\nate. The court, in its opinion, either agrees or disagrees with this opinion of\nthe patent examiner. \"Validity,\" or the truly \"valid\" patent, is thus subject to\nthe opinion of the judge - and the opinion, even of judges as pictured by the\npublic, is a function of a human-machine temperament, education, background,\nexperience, intellect, and prejudice.\nAre we also to pretend that a theoretical system exists, according to which\nthe skill of the lawyers, the courtroom atmosphere, the demeanor of the wit\n2Ibid.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nnesses, and the nature of the parties are of no consequence in the ultimate result\nof the truly \"valid\" patent? And if, as stated in earlier chapters, the United\nStates Supreme Court is going to call upon the suggestions of Cellini in the six\nteenth century 3 to overthrow a patent in the mid-twentieth century - a patent\nrepresenting an invention that had solved a long-time problem and the solution\nof which no one could see in Cellini except certain Supreme Court judges whom\nJustice Jackson characterized as having a \"passion\" to strike down patents - we\nmight just as well abandon the hope that a more thorough search will result in\nthe truly \"valid\" patent.\nAnother illustration is found in a case 4 where the judge had before him\nthe very same prior patents that the examiner himself had considered in the\nPatent Office, and on the basis of which the latter had ruled that invention was\npresent. The search, thus, was perfect. The defendant was not able to find prior\nart any better than that which the examiner had fully considered. The judge\nadmitted that the best prior art had been \"cited by the Patent Office Examiner\nand his allowance of the claims of the Kline patent was a finding on his part\nthat the patents do not disclose a tensioning spring with means of adjustment.\"\nThe court continued: \"With this I do not concur.\" And then the judge went\non to say that all the inventor had done was to employ \"familiar applications\nof mechanical skill respecting adjustability.\" The court, therefore, on the same\nrecord as that before the technical patent examiner, reached the conclusion that\nthe advance made was due to mere \"mechanical skill,\" an adjustment that any\nmechanic could have made, and hence lacked the unobviousness for which a\npatent should be granted.\nSo long, therefore, as the real test of invention is a matter of the opinion\nas to whether or not what has been done represents a real advance, how can\nthis affect the matter of perfect searching? The court can always disagree with\nthe Patent Office opinion, particularly if the court is imbued with the before-\nmentioned \"passion.\" Hence I am convinced that, while more thorough and\neasier searching is a desirable end, Dr. Bush's hope that this will result in truly\nvalid patents is vain. The late Supreme Court Justice Jackson, as previously\nnoted, has frankly admitted that \"the only patent that is valid is one which this\nCourt has not been able to get its hands on.\"\nSuffice it for present purposes, therefore, to state that if one can now be\nthwarted in court by the writings of Cellini in the sixteenth century, it will\nrequire not only the detailed cataloging of the mere 11,000,000 documents\npresently accumulated in the Patent Office, but almost every piece of litera\nture ever recorded - including the fantastic predictions of science fiction 5 .\n6.3\nOpposition Proceedings\nThe next proposal made in this Bush study is to set up in this country a system\nof opposition. When the Patent office intends to grant a patent, it must publish\n3In the Jungerson case. See above, p. 65.\n4Kline v. Creative Textiles Inc., 146 F. Supp. 65.\n5236 F. 2d 713 (1958).\n\nCreate or Perish\nthat intention and thereby permit any interested person to oppose the grant by\npresenting evidence to the examiner in the Patent Office which may dissuade\nhim from issuing the patent. In this way, it is hoped, the court will feel that the\npublic has had an opportunity to call the attention of the Patent Office to the\nvery best prior art in existence so that, if the Office should grant the patent, the\npresumption of validity would be strengthened. This proposal, however, is also\nreally based upon the hypothesis that the inadequacy of the search is at least one\nprincipal reason why the courts have thrown out patents. I shall now endeavor\nto show that there is no validity to this hypothesis, and that instituting such an\nopposition proceeding would only delay the issuance of patents and complicate\nfurther the procedure and expense of trying to obtain a patent in the many\nthousands of cases where there will be no litigation.\nOf sixty decisions of the various Courts of Appeals prior to 1963, in which\npatents were invalidated upon the ground that they did not disclose a sufficiently\nimportant advance over what had been done before to warrant such a grant, the\ncourt specifically indicated in eight cases that it was invalidating the patent on\nthe basis of new art that the Patent Office had overlooked. In my study of some\nof those cases, moreover, based on my education and experience as a physicist\nand a lawyer, I came to the considered view that the so-called \"overlooked\"\npatents were actually no more pertinent than the ones actually considered by\nthe examiner. As a matter of fact, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\nremarked that\nit is as reasonable to conclude that a prior art patent not cited was\nconsidered and cast aside because not pertinent, as to conclude that\nit was inadvertently overlooked 6 .\nThe patent examiner cannot possibly cite all the patents that bear on a given\ninvention. He picks out what he considers the closest to an anticipation of the\napplicant's concept, and places on the applicant the burden of demonstrating\nthat he has exercised invention.\nIn seven of the Court of Appeals decisions mentioned above, moreover, the\ncourts were perfectly satisfied that the Patent Office had made a thorough\nsearch, and so did not rely on any additional prior art to that cited and con\nsidered by the examiner. They just had an opinion different from that of the\nPatent Office as to the matter of invention.\nFor the remaining cases of this group of decisions, there is nothing to indi\ncated an inadequate search.\nIt does not appear, therefore, that the courts are primarily rejecting patents\nbecause of inadequate search. How, indeed, can a more exhaustive search solve\nthe problem of disagreement between a court and the examiner as to whether a\ngiven step represents the work of a mere mechanic or of a creative inventor? If\nthe reason for opposition proceedings rests upon the supposition that the court\nmust be convinced that a thorough search has been made, it seems that the\nunderlying hypothesis has been proved fallacious.\n6Helm v. Lake Shore, 107 U.S.P.Q. 313.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nWhile all patents represent potential litigation, and should therefore be care\nfully prosecuted by attorneys and closely scrutinized by the Patent Office, the\nDistrict Courts throughout the land actually adjudicated only about 0.3 per\ncent of all patents during the period from 1948 to 1963. Opposition proceedings\nin every case would have resulted in holding up the issuance of 99.7 per cent of\nthe patents for the supposed benefit of three tenths of a per cent. Still, even\nthis might be worthwhile if the courts could thereby be persuaded to dispense\njustice fairly and so to contribute to a constructive and healthy growth in the\nlaw of patents.\nWe can obtain a clue, however, from what happens in foreign countries that\nactually do employ opposition proceedings. In Great Britain, there is no rigid\nexamination, such as we have here. After an application is accepted, however,\nit is published for opposition. The grounds for opposition are the same as those\nfor invalidating a patent in an infringement suit, namely anticipation by prior\ninventors and prior use or disclosure in Great Britain. In 1958, for example,\n18,531 patents were sealed, but only 382 oppositions were filed. In Great Britain,\nfurthermore, there is also a delayed opposition. Any time within twelve months\nof the issuance of a patent, revocation proceedings may be instituted, but in\n1958, there were only 81 such proceedings. So the total of oppositions in Great\nBritain that year was actually about 2.5 per cent.\nIf this country could operate with but 2.5 per cent of oppositions, these pro\nposals might warrant some consideration. But it should be pointed out that, in\nthe period from 1950 to 1960, without any real search or any statutory presump\ntion of validity inuring to the patent, such as supposedly exists in our law, the\nappellate courts in Great Britain sustained more than half of the patents before\nthem. This seems to reflect an attitude of property rights and of encouragement\nof new ideas, new products, and new industries, different from ours.\nIn Holland, a country that has a rigid patent-examination system, 10,593\napplications were published from 1951 through 1954, 803 of which were opposed,\nor about 7.6 per cent. Again, this is a relatively small proportion. As a result\nof those oppositions, however, the Dutch Patent Office reconsidered its decision\nto grant the patent in slightly more than half of the opposed cases; so mistakes\nwere apparently caught before the patent grant.\nIn Sweden, another country with a rigid examination system, 5,005 patents\nwere published for opposition in 1954, of which 409 were opposed, approximated\n8 per cent.\nThe real test, however, comes in calling attention to the one country closest\nto the United States in aggressive industrialization, namely West Germany. The\nsituation there provides a real indication of what might happen if oppositions\nwere instituted in the United States. The German search is rigid, just as ours is;\nbut it has not been my experience that the search made by patent examiners in\nGermany, even as a result of opposition proceedings, is any more thorough than\nthat in the better examining divisions or groups of the United States Patent\nOffice.\nAfter a German patent is published by the Patent Office for opposition,\ninterested outsiders may file opposition briefs and sometimes appear at oral\n\nCreate or Perish\nhearings, to try to persuade the Office that the patent should not be granted.\nIn 1954, 16,743 applications were published, and 5,710 were opposed - 34 per\ncent of the total number of published applications.\nOppositions in more than a third of the cases in the United States would\nplay havoc in the overburdened Patent Office, and would make the way of the\nsmall inventor and the small company even more unbearable. Large companies\nand even smaller organizations would undoubtedly oppose almost all patents in\ntheir fields as a matter of course, and we would probably have something like 80\nper cent or more of all patents opposed, in contract to West Germany's slightly\nmore than a third.\nAnd to what advantage - particularly where it is doubtful whether the sup\nposed inadequacy of the search is what fundamentally influences the court to\nthrow out patents? Again we query: Would opposition proceedings have helped\nin the Jungerson case where the Supreme Court reached back to the suggestions\nof Cellini in the sixteenth century to throw out a patent in the twentieth?\n6.4\nTechnically Trained Tribunals\nWe come now to a third proposition, namely, that there should be a special\nscientific or technical tribunal that would find scientific and technical facts for\nthe judge. Dr. Bush says, \"It is unreasonable to require judges, skilled in the law\nbut not in science, to judge the merits of highly technical or scientific matters\n7.\"\nSimilar remarks, however, apply to litigation in other fields, economics,\nadmiralty, medicine, and other specialized areas in which the lay judge generally\nis not trained. The question really resolves itself as follows: Has the invalidating\nof patents been shown to reside in a wrong understanding of the science or the\ntechnical points involved?\nRarely does one hear the complaint that a judge who has conscientiously\ndone his \"homework\" did not understand adequately the scientific issues in\nvolved. These are always reduced to common, simple terms that an intelligent\nlay judge can understand. Technical experts on each side explain the few crucial\npoints in everyday language, with analogies to matters understood by the court.\nThere is room for complaint, however, where the judge abdicates and makes\nno real effort to do a conscientious job. Most patent lawyers appear to agree\nthat they much prefer the judicial temperament of a judge who hears all kinds\nof cases, and can himself weigh the issues in a patent case - provided that he is\nfree of the \"passion\" to which Justice Jackson referred. Reliance upon factual\ndeterminations by a technical advisor is dangerous, particularly in view of the\nfact that, once a technically trained individual knows the solution of a problem,\nthat solution often has become obvious. By virtue of his very training, a man\nwith only technical training is not usually equipped to determine whether an\nadvance was or was not something a skilled mechanic could have done. It is the\njudge who is trained to weigh and deal with obscure standards which define the\n7Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Study 8, 86th Congress,\n2d Session (1961), cites numerous instances where court-appointed experts have been used to\nexplain details.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\n\"mechanic skilled in the art\" in patent cases and \"reasonable or prudent man\"\nin negligence cases.\nThe British patent bar has succeeded in relatively recent times in having a\njudge with some engineering background appointed to hear only patent cases.\nSoon this judge, thus restricted in his judicial duties, fell into the rut of making\nsuch decisions as one might expect from a technician and not legally tempered\ndecisions which reflected judicial perspicacity and temperament. Within a very\nshort time, the House of Lords had to reverse this judge in seven of his patent\ndecisions. One of our British associates appraised the judge as having become\n\"lost in technical aspects without judicial consideration.\"\nAnother illustration of the dangers of a strictly technician attitude and the\nsafeguard of impartial judicial consideration is afforded by a comparison of the\ndecisions, involving the same invention, of the appeal department of the Dutch\nPatent Office (heavily controlled by its chairman, the commissioner of patents)\nand the District Court for the District of Columbia, in General Radio Co. v.\nWatson 8 . The invention in issue related to a discovery that, in certain kinds of\nautotransformers operating in industrial uses with carbon brushes that tap off\ndifferent voltages from different portions of the copper winding thereof, burn-out\nfailures were initiated by a destructive type of high-temperature copper oxide\nemanating from the winding itself, and not from overheating of the carbon brush\nand its assembly, as had been believed for years by those skilled in this art.\nA solution was found in preventing the development of the high-temperature\ncopper oxide by an appropriate coating.\nThe examiners of both the Dutch and United States Patent Offices cited\nprecisely the same prior art dealing with coatings for different purposes on dif\nferent types of electrical devices, and finally rejected the respective applications.\nThe technical Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office upheld its\nexaminer's final rejection.\nIn Holland, however, the before-mentioned commissioner's appeal depart\nment - from which no further appeal or review may be taken - overruled the\nexaminer as to the pertinence of the prior art and found that the inventor was\nactually the first to have made the discovery, despite the fact that engineers\nall over the world had sought for many years to solve the problem. Whether\nmotivated by a desire to protect Dutch industry, as I firmly believe from my not\ninconsiderable experience, or by some other conviction, the technician-controlled\nappeal department certainly evolved a new doctrine of unpatentability. It ruled\nthat even though no one had solved the problem before, and since the failure\ncould only have come either from the carbon brush side or the winding side, it\nshould have occurred to engineers that if it wasn't the carbon brush that was at\nfault, it must be the winding:\nThe Appeal Department is of the opinion that, since in the present\ncase there was only a choice between two possibilities, no invention\ncan be appreciated in finding the true cause of the burning-out of\n8188 F. Supp. 879 (1960).\n\nCreate or Perish\nthe known transformers (namely the cupric oxide formation on the\ncopper turns), even when on reasonable grounds the abnormal be\nhavior of the carbon brush would at first sight be suspected as the\ncause.\nThis confusion of hindsight with foresight, once the solution of a problem has\nbeen made clear, has been observed in many able technically trained men with\nwhom I have worked.\nThe ability to put matters in proper perspective and to weigh the likelihood\nof events without becoming entangled in details - in short, to see the forest and\nnot the trees - is particularly a forte of the well-trained legal mind. Thus, in\noverruling the United States Patent Office, Judge Morris of the District Court\nfor the District of Columbia held:\nThere can be no question but that the method discovered by Mr.\nSmiley, employed by plaintiff, and described in the application con\nstitutes a marked improvement over the original patented device,\nespecially when employed in industrial plants, and that it has com\npletely overcome the failure difficulties inherent in the original device\nfor such use. . . . Indeed the Board did not deny the commercial ac\nceptance and the obvious success of the method discovered by Mr.\nSmiley, and affirmed that \"the problem of transformer failure under\ncertain adverse conditions or operation was an elusive matter for\nsome period of time,\" and that the \"problem of transformer failure\nwas not found until an extensive research program was conducted.\"\nThe rare interdisciplinary man, however, who combines judicial tempera\nment with a scientific background can not only preserve rights in the matter\neffected by Judge Morris, but can do so with a conviction as to the technical\nsoundness of his findings that most lay judges do not have. Couple this with\ncreative ability, and the law of patents as well as that affecting other phases\nof science and technology will blossom as we grow up out of our mid-twentieth\ncentury infancy.\nIt is incumbent upon society - including our engineering and scientific com\nmunity - to persuade the few talented interdisciplinary men of the present gen\neration to give their country the benefit of this kind of leadership. The nation\nmust not continue to struggle with well-meaning and able political and judicial\npersonnel, who, though educated by early twentieth-century standards in the\narts, law, and the social sciences, lack an interdisciplinary training and the real\nexperience in technology and science that is essential for intelligent, confident,\nand progressive decision making in this era. Many decisions of government to\nday turn upon scientific and technological considerations far beyond the genuine\nunderstanding of those called upon to make the decisions.\nIt is frightening when a judge, or a cabinet member, or a president, must\nrely upon technical advisors, not just for details or analyses of problems and\nopinions as to courses of action (which appears proper and essential), but also\nfor very fundamental and underlying scientific and technical bases of decisions.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nWho, then, really makes the decision? We desperately need the experienced\ninterdisciplinary and creative man in government, and we must strive to educate\nsuch rare individuals if we expect to manifest the leadership and growth essential\nto develop America's future greatness in this age of science. Otherwise we shall\nmerely maintain custodianship of America's prior standard of accomplishment\nby \"politicians as usual.\"\nLet us turn now from the general to the specific. If judges selected from\namong the most able practicing lawyers who have stemmed from, and have in\nterdisciplinarily employed, a substantial scientific background and experience,\nand who have demonstrated record of creative talent, were appointed, this would\nbreathe new life into the law of patents and other facets of our rapidly merging\nsocial-scientific way of life. Since such appointment is purely political (the pres\nident having power to select all federal judges at all echelons), pressure by the\nengineering and scientific community can conceivably have its effect. Rather\nthan provide for the virtual abdication of decision by the judiciary (or, more\ngenerally, by governmental officers) to a technical tribunal or board of advisors,\ntherefore, I propose the upgrading of the political and appointive officers by in\ncluding some really talented interdisciplinary men who are now, almost without\nexception, engaged in private pursuits.\n6.5\nAre Today's Patents Worth Saving?\nIn the course of his testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Patents,\nTrademarks, and Copyrights (October 10 - 12, 1955) the late Judge Learned\nHand was interrogated by the late Senator O'Mahoney as follows 9:\nIs it in your opinion a good and useful thing, I am substituting\n\"good and new\" now, for Congress to exercise the power that the\nConstitution gave to it to provide by law for the exclusive use of the\ninventions or discoveries of inventors? Is it a good and useful thing,\ndoes it promote the arts and sciences?\nJudge Hand replied:\nThat is just the question. Nobody knows and nobody can know until\nthey examine how the system which has been working after all for\n150 years works in our present very complicated industrial society.\n. . . Each side is beating the air. On one hand you have a lot of people\nthat say the country would fall down without the patent system and\non the other hand you have people like Thurman Arnold, former\njudge in the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, who say\nthe patent system has outlived its usefulness, it is no good any more,\nit's now a tool for misuse on the part of the big corporations.\nThen, giving his own views as a result of his many years on the bench, Judge\nHand continued:\n9Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Study 1.\n\nCreate or Perish\nThe place for stimulus, I think, is those people who are very com\npetent and would be induced by that hope of a pecuniary reward to\ndevote themselves as entirely as is necessary.\nAnd when he was specifically asked:\nIn all of your experience on the bench on patent cases, have you\nreceived no glimmering or notion as to whether or not the patent\nlaw has served a useful purpose?\nJudge Hand replied:\nI have an opinion. . . . I think it has a great one.\nAt the end of his report, there are statements by officials of some of our\nmore promising small companies and by individual inventors on what the patent\nsystem has mean to them. For example, counsel for Polaroid says 10:\nThe company obviously places great reliance upon its patents. Its\nbusiness is very largely dependent upon its patent structure and it\nhas from the outset followed a vigorous patent policy of obtaining\nprotection on all of its commercial products and in addition on such\ndevelopments of its research group as may possess potential com\nmercial value. . . . We think there is no question but that Dr. Land's\nsuccess in commercializing and developing his inventions in light po\nlarizing materials was to a large extent due to the patents obtained\non those inventions.\nPursuing further the question whether the patent system is worth saving, let\nus refer to Study 3 before this same Congressional committee and a subsequent\nstaff \"Analysis of Patent Litigation Status 11.\" In the period from 1949 through\n1960, 58.5 per cent of all issued patents were assigned to corporations. (There\nwas no way of ascertaining how many of these assigned patents had originally\nbeen the fruits of independent inventors who later assigned their applications.)\nForty per cent were issued to individuals and were unassigned to corporations.\nThe remainder of patentees included foreigners, the United States Government,\nand others. Of this 58.5 per cent, however, only a little more than one-third\nrepresents the large corporations of the United States. A total of 73 per cent\nof all patents granted from 1939 through 1960, accordingly, were granted to\nindividuals (private inventors or backers) who held their own patents, or to the\nsmall corporations.\nThe little fellow is, of course, the one who requires the most protection\n- and he is the one who is stimulated by the assurance of protection to risk\nall, and thereby to advance the progress of the useful arts. The little fellow,\n10Ibid., 266.\n11Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights, Study 3, 86th Congress,\n2d Session (1961).\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nhowever, rarely if ever reaches the Supreme Court, because the Court, with its\nheavy burdens, has refused to grant certiorari in certain kinds of patent cases 12 .\nIndeed, any case it does hear that in any way involves patents is heard as a result\nof most unusual circumstances, as where the government joins in requesting the\nCourt to take the case. Small corporations and individual inventors thus suffer\nbecause the lower courts feel compelled to follow in all instances the precedents\nlaid down when the Supreme Court exercises what Justice Jackson termed its\n\"passion\" to strike down the patents of the giant corporations.\nI have mentioned in previous chapters some of the many individuals whose\npractical breakthroughs, in many different fields, have given the technological\nadvances that we enjoy today, and who have led to the development and growth\nof many new companies that play important roles in our present economy. They\nwere small individuals when they started. Fortunately, the process is not dead.\nIn the very recent past, many of the basic developments of the Atomic Age,\nso called, were brought about by individuals, not by the larger companies and\nnot by government-sponsored research. This is the history of Einstein, Ruther\nford, Fermi, Dunning, Edgerton and others, working originally as individuals in\ncollege laboratories and the like.\nFormer Patent Commissioner Casper Ooms points out 13:\nMany of the names of large corporations of today are the familiar\nnames of the individuals who founded them; Westinghouse, Dupont,\nGoodyear, Singer, Ford, Edison, Bell, Wright - the list is endless.\nThe individual is not yet to be discarded. It is from his single mind\nand single-minded purpose that invention comes far more frequently\nthan most suspect or than the statutes revel.\nLook not alone to\nthe great contributions of the 19th century but look to our own\ngeneration or even this decade. There was De Forest with his tri\node, Armstrong with radio circuitry, Land with the Polaroid camera\nand so many others. The inventor working alone. Small business\ngrowing upon the advancing the individual's contributions, and all\nin fields in which large corporate enterprises with vast and proved\nresearch facilities were outdistanced by those single minds and the\nsmall businesses in which they worked. Yet in spite of these superior\nfacilities and the broader range of interests to which the research\nof these larger institutions is directed very frequently the \"break\nthrough,\" the startling innovation comes from small business and\nsmall laboratories. . . . Small business is a challenge for the bold and\nventuresome who ask only that they be permitted to continue the\nfight under the rule under which they have so successfully fought\nmediocrity, stagnation, and decline.\n12Since the passing of the 1952 Patent Act, the Supreme Court has declined to review every\ncase submitted to it in which the issue turned on the question of what is or is not invention\nunder this law.\n13\"Patents, Small Business, and the Age of Research,\" in Journal of the Patent Office\nSociety, Vol. 40, p. 5 (January, 1958).\n\nCreate or Perish\nTo the same effect is the report of Attorney George E. Frost before the\nSenate Judiciary Committee in Study 2 14:\nIt remains for the nonconformist, often an inexperienced outsider,\nto take the steps that lead to significant development. History is\nreplete with incidents of this kind.\nThe experienced designers of\nshoe manufacturing machinery considered and underestimated the\ncement process. The engineers of a smaller, less experienced concern\nrecognized the potentialities and made a success of the process. It\nwas the \"practical\" worker and \"tinkerer\" in a comparatively small\ncompany who devised the first successful adhesive cellophane tape\nand not the Dupont scientists who were working on the same prob\nlem. General Electric and Westinghouse - research-conscious orga\nnizations with large budgets - both misjudged the value of the wire\ntype photoflash lamp. The result was that a comparatively small\ncompany, Wabash Appliance Company, exploited this product.\nRecent studies at the University of Chicago by Professor John Jewkes show\nthat of sixty major inventions since 1900 (the era of substantial industrial and\ngovernment research activities), thirty-three - more than half - sprang from the\nwork of individual inventors! Included in these inventions were penicillin, the\nelectron microscope, the synthetic light polarizer, streptomycin, the domestic\ngas refrigerator, the helicopter, quick-freezing, the cyclotron, the ball-point pen,\nchromium plating, the self-winding wrist watch, and the slide fastener.\nAnd in many cases, as history shows over and over again, important inven\ntions are made by others than those who are experts in the field and by complete\noutsiders to the organized research organizations. Jewkes illustrates:\nThe jet engine was invented and for a time developed by men who\nwere not specialists in engine design. The gyro-compass was invented\nby a youth who was neither a scientist nor a sailor. Power steer\ning, basic radio inventions, cracking petroleum, magnetic recorders\n- these and other major developments occurred outside companies\nconcerned with their use 15 .\nThe facts thus show that we cannot rely upon government and large-company\nresearch alone if we are to maintain our technological and economic superiority\nin this day of serious challenge from the Soviet Union.\nIn reporting on a panel discussion before the American Institute of Electrical\nEngineers 16, S. W. Herwald revealed that the Soviets\nhave copied many of the good parts of our private-enterprise system.\n. . . Incentive systems are used to encourage new ideas.\n14Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Study 2, p.\n18, 84th\nCongress, 2d Session (1957).\n15John Jewkes, The Sources of Invention, Macmillan, 1959, p. 50.\n16S.W. Herwald, \"Economics and Incentive Plans,\" report of panel discussion, American\nInstitute of Electrical Engineers, Feb. 1-6, 1959. Unpublished.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nPatents are one of our primary present-day incentive systems. Discourage in\nvention by individuals and \"outsiders,\" and you dry up one of our historical\nsources of important advances.\nA further article 17 reveals the following disturbing facts with regard to\nthe pace of invention in the United States. When it is remembered that all\ngovernment-sponsored research contracts require patent disclosures; that the\ngovernment itself employs at least five different and independent agency staffs of\npatent attorney working full time to file applications to protect the government\non patentable advances; and that private industry still scrupulously files for\npatents at least for defensive purposes so that it may make its own products\nwithout lawsuits; then it will be seen that the number of patents may be some\nkind of an index of the number of inventions made in this country. I have drawn\nthe following conclusions from the data presented in the article referred to:\n1. While research and development spending has risen tenfold from 1930\nto 1960, the number of patents issued each year has remained substantially the\nsame.\n2. There is a lower yield of invention in government research work and mixed\ngovernment-industry research work than in industrial-commercial work.\n3. In today's industrial research laboratory, each invention probably repre\nsents a minimum of about 7.5 man years of effort.\n4. The national average of effort underlying each patent issued to an Amer\nican corporation appears to be about 30 man-years.\n5. The United States, in the community of Western-bloc nations, is below\nSwitzerland, Sweden, Germany, Norway, Denmark, and Great Britain in per\ncapita inventions.\nCan we afford, in these perilous times, to do less than maximize the effectiveness\nof all our incentive systems, including patents?\nWhile the foregoing discussion, it is hoped, demonstrates that patents still\nserve a vitally important function today, particularly in the case of the individual\ninventor or small company, the question is frequently raised whether patents\ndo not stifle progress, particularly when in the hands of corporate enterprises.\nWhy this question should even arise today - when many corporate giants have\nabdicated to the wishes of our government antitrust lawyers, and have, in effect,\nthrown open their patents to avoid litigation - is hard to understand. As former\npatent commissioner Robert C. Watson, now chairman of the Advisory Council\nof the George Washington University Patent Foundation, has pointed out:\nAs a result of the RCA, IBM, and A T & T [consent] decrees, 22,500\npatents were dropped down the drain, so to speak thrown open, and\nI'm wondering when and where an evaluation of the economic effect\nof this disaster will ever be made 18 .\nIn answer to this question of patents allegedly stifling rather than promot\ning the progress of the useful arts, moreover, I might refer to a typical example.\n17Frank A. Howard, \"The Lagging Pace of U.S. Invention,\" Product Engineering, July 18,\n1960, p. 75.\n18Samuel W. Bryant, \"The Patent Mess,\" Fortune, Sept., 1962, pp. 111-112, 226, 231-232.\n\nCreate or Perish\nWhen the Radio Corporation developed its color-television tube, the so-called\nshadow-mask tube, CBS-Hytron was prodded, not discouraged, to develop im\nproved methods of making such tubes; General Electric Company developed the\nalternative post-accelerator type of color tube based upon a different principle;\nthe late Professor E. O. Lawrence developed the Chromotron, based on still\nanother principle; and the Philco Company developed the \"Apple Tube,\" based\non still another technique. Thus the issuance of patents, even to large corporate\nentities, does not stifle progress. On the contrary, it impels other corporations\nto find ways of getting around the patent, and in that sense admirably serves\nthe purposes of Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\nThe present utility of a patent-sparked competitive system as compared\nwith solely government-sponsored research and development is discussed also\nby Attorney Frost 19:\nExperience with government-sponsored research and manufacture -\nwhere the pressures of competition are normally absent - also brings\nout the value of competition in research. It was a group of \"out\nsiders\" who insisted that the gaseous diffusion process be pursued\nto separate isotopes in the atomic bomb development - and this\nprocess ultimately proved most successful. In the wartime synthetic\nrubber program, the RFC, thinking primarily in monetary terms,\nfirst authorized only the construction of butadiene plants based on\npetroleum as raw material. Yet it turned out that 80 percent of the\nbutadiene produced in 1943 came from the alcohol-base plant con\nstructed under pressure from Congress. The postwar experience in\nsynthetic rubber is even more revealing. . . . An analyst of research\nprogress in industry reports that all of the 6 major postwar tech\nnical developments, however, have come in large measure from 4\ncompanies that did not participate in the government program and\nconducted research in a competitive atmosphere. Similarly unsatis\nfactory experience has been reported in connection with government\ncontracted development in aircraft engines. The lesson of history is\nclear. . . . The patent system is a powerful force toward maintenance\nof a competitive atmosphere. Existing concerns are forced - upon\npain of payment of royalties or even foreclosure from a successful\ndevelopment - to explore all alternatives with an open mind. On\nthe positive side, the availability of patent protection encourages\nthe entrance into industry of new companies with fresh approaches\nunbiased by mental blocks that often result from experience.\nTo give another illustration: At the time the atomic energy program reached\nthe point, during World War II, where it critically needed certain specialized\nelectronic apparatus, it was merely necessary to adopt the inventions of a pro\nfessor who, in our free economy and under the encouragement of our patent\n19See above, fn. 13.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nlaws, had previously been stimulated to develop the art. What if, however, he\nhad not struck out on his own?\n6.6\nWhat is Wrong\nBut what faces the professor, other individual inventors and small businessmen\ntoday? They face the \"passion\" mentioned earlier and the apparent fact that the\nonly valid patent is the one that the Supreme Court cannot get its hands on. And\nthey face the likelihood that the lower courts will follow what Judge Learned\nHand stated were \"our orders\" from the Supreme Court. They face, also, the\nattitude of many large companies and the government, who are convinced that\nthey can appropriate inventions in the knowledge that the patents will probably\nbe thrown out in court and the claimant worn down.\nRecall the earlier-quoted condemnation of this practice by Judge Wyzanski.\nRecall, also, the situation of Professors Cady and Pierce and the American\nTelephone and Telegraph Company, with which I dealt previously. The scientific\ncommunity, moreover, mourns the suicide of Major Edwin Armstrong at a time\nwhen he was locked in a harassing battle with several large infringing corporate\nenterprises in connection with his frequency-modulation patents.\nEven before the complication of the present-day Supreme Court attitude,\nThomas A. Edison was quoted from the New York World of June 3, 1900:\nThere is no such thing in this country as an inventor's monopoly.\nThe moment he invents something that is an epochmaker in the\nworld of science and commerce, there will be pirates who spring up\non all sides and contest his rights to his ideas 20 .\nThirty years later, Edison remarked:\nCounting the expense of experimenting and fighting for my claims\nin Court, these patents have cost me more than they have returned\nme in royalties. . . . We have a miserable system in the United States\nfor protecting inventions from infringement. I have known of several\ninventors who were poor. Their ideas would have made them mil\nlionaires, but they were kept poor by the pirates who were allowed\nthrough our very faulty system of protection to usurp their rights.\n. . . I had to fight a long time in court over my claims . . . persisting\nin litigation sometimes for ten, twelve, or fourteen years 21 .\nAnother roadblock in the path of the engineer and applied scientist and the\nsmall company trying to produce new inventions is the position of some members\nof the patent bar itself, who have taken full advantage of the hostility of the\ncourts by themselves challenging all patents as a matter of course. They should\nnot now be heard criticizing the courts when attempting to sustain patents,\nsince they taught the courts how to be hostile.\n20Remisen Crawford, \"Patents, Profits and Pirates - An Interview with Thomas A. Edison,\"\nSaturday Evening Post, September 27, 1930, p. 3.\n21Ibid.\n\nCreate or Perish\nThe practice of the United States Government itself in wearing down inven\ntors claiming compensation from the government for its use of their inventions\nis another discouraging feature. The Department of Justice has had a policy to\nthe effect that, when a royalty owed by the government to an outside inventor\nwas substantial, the inventor's claim was to be denied. The investor, in making\nclaim against the Army, the Navy, the AEC, the Air Force, moreover, is sub\njected to a different investigation by the patent departments of each branch, a\nprocess extending over many years and which, if the sums involved are large,\nusually results in sending the inventor into court with the government cards\nstacked against him.\nThere are numerous cases, furthermore, where small companies have sold\ntheir commercial instruments to the government and then found the latter freely\ndisseminating details of these proprietary items and letting them out for com\npetitive bids to anyone who comes along, regardless of patent or other rights\ninvolved. Then the originators had to seek their remedies (if any) in court 22 .\nGovernment contracts, as before explained, include clauses to the effect that\nno matter how much work a person may have done in perfecting an inven\ntion before the contract, and despite the existence or prior patents or patent\napplications, unless he had, prior to the contract, sufficient resources to build\ncompletely and operate successfully the invention, the government obtains at\nleast a free license to the invention and, in atomic and space developments, it\neven obtains complete ownership thereof, with no obligations to the inventor.\nSenator Russell B. Long 23 believes the public interest is served by vesting in\nthe public complete title to any inventions resulting from government-sponsored\ncontracts. His belief stems apparently from the misconceptions that the profit\nfrom government contracts is in any measure related to or compensatory for the\ninvestment in background of the contractee 24, or that the most able workers\nand companies will meekly sell their brain children for whatever the government\noffers, or that whoever is forced to take the government terms will be able to\ndo the job as the \"public interest\" deserves. Representative Emilio Q. Daddario\n25, on the other hand, would settle for a compulsory royalty-free nonexclusive\nlicense to the government.\nThe late President Kennedy's recent directive 26\nstill appears to leave the government agencies to their own devices within cer\ntain prescribed ground rules, including prompt use of inventions by companies\n22See above, fn. 18.\n23Russell B. Long, \"A Government Patent Policy to Serve the Public Interest,\" and E. Q.\nDaddarios, \"A Government Patent Policy to Serve the Public Interest,\" 47 American Bar\nAssociation Journal, 675-681 and 671, respectively (July, 1961).\n24John T. Connor, \"Innovators and Patents,\" The Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Jour\nnal of Research and Education, Vol 6, p. 145 (1962): \"in selecting a contractor, the government\ntakes advantage of an already existing situation in most cases by turning to a contractor with\naccumulated experience, knowledge, and know-how in a specific field - gained at the contrac\ntor's expense. Consequently, it can hardly be said that the government has borne the full cost\nof developing the invention, if one should emerge.\"\n25See above, fn. 23.\n26October 10, 1963, memorandum from the President to heads of executive departments\nand agencies on government patent policy, with statement attached. Federal Register, Oct.\n12, 1963.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nretaining commercial rights on pain of compulsory licensing; but there is still\nunrest in some quarters of Congress 27 .\nBut, just as any employee, consultant, or contractee with a spark of pride\nor spunk insists on freedom to contract with an employer or contractor as to\nthe terms under which he will perform his work, so those who are to carry out\ngovernment contracts should be entitled to negotiate freely with the govern\nment. They should be able to obtain flexible and fair terms of compensation\nfor the use of inventions arising under different types of circumstances, even\nif developed with the aid of government funds. Many a talented employee or\nconsultant refuses to consider salary alone or a pittance profit figure adequate\npayment for picking his brains, but insists on negotiating a return bearing more\nrealistic relation to the value of the work to the contractor. Should government\nbe deprived of the abilities of the most able minds, because Congress forbids\ngovernment negotiators flexibility in reaching the kind of terms that such talent\ngenerally insists upon?\nIf we are to accede to the presently popular philosophy that we should wel\ncome the paternalistic guidance of enlightened government, are we not entitled\nto expect Congress to trust its government contractors with freedom to nego\ntiate? If government officials cannot be so trusted, but must be fitted into the\n\"uniform policy\" currently advocated in high circles, then we cannot complain\nbecause the results are uniformly mediocre. Attorney Reed C. Lawlor of the\nCalifornia bar 28 points out that\nEmployees can negotiate special contracts with employers respecting\ntheir inventions. Why should government contractors be forbidden\nby law to negotiate special contracts with the government? . . . There\nare many individuals who refuse to work for industrial employers\nwho require them to assign all inventions made by them to their\nemployers. . . . These men who have refused to become employees\nof companies that would bind them with such contracts often form\ntheir own companies and create new industries and new businesses\nto the benefit of the entire public and of mankind. . . . The rights of\nthe individuals are destroyed where laws are enacted which destroy\nthe freedom of contractors to negotiate equitable contracts with the\ngovernment which would provide fair compensation for the use of\ninventions developed by the contractors.\nRecent Congressional hearings have, indeed, revealed a decided reluctance\non the part of very talented technical organizations and personnel to offer their\nideas to, or to work for, the government monopoly in space and atomic technol\nogy. Is the \"public interest\" served by depriving government of the talents of\nunusual people and organizations?\n27Senate Bill S1290, 1963, 88th Congress, 1st Session.\n28Reed C. Lawlor, \"The Public Interest: Government Patent Policy and Equity,\" 47 Amer\nican Bar Association Journal 972 (Oct. 1961).\n\nCreate or Perish\nAs a corollary, it is simple to predict the fate of the well-intentioned, but\npatently immature policy of \"not-for-profit\" contracts now offered by govern\nment. The strong professorial sponsorship of this policy reflects the dangers of\nextrapolating into the real world the well-meaning theories evolved in university\nand other ivory-tower experiences.\nIt is rather ironical that we should be grabbing all rights for the state in\nthe so-called \"public interest,\" at a time when even the Soviet Union has rec\nognized and adopted our tested, but now abandoned, capitalistic schemes for\nstimulating creativity through reward to the individual. The Soviets, apparently\nunimpressed by the government ownership and control programs that today are\nbeing proposed in America, make payments, over and beyond mere salary even\nto their own state-employed inventors, for government use of the inventions that\nthe state itself has financed!\nAdmiral Luis deFlores put it this way 29:\nThe patent system was created to reward and stimulate ingenuity\nand inventiveness. Classifying a novel idea as the inventor's property\nwhich could be reserved for exclusive use or sold or leased for a roy\nalty permits the idea to be used openly without fear of competition\nfor 17 years and with due recourse to law if infringed.\nThese rights and benefits have produced a powerful incentive for\npeople to exercise their ingenuity and devote their efforts to finding\nnew, improved ways to do things and new tools with which to do\nthem. There is no doubt that the existence of the patent and patent\nrights has had a profound influence on the rapid industrial growth\nof our country and served to bring native ingenuity to the force.\nIn recent years, however, there has been a tendency on the part of\nthe government to appropriate patent rights of individuals which will\nreduce and tend to kill the incentive they were originally designed\nto produce. History tells us that socialism, despite its well-meaning\nideals, just doesn't work in the competitive world in which man has\nevolved. Man's natural tendency is to try to outdo his fellow man.\nIf his efforts are not rewarded or are frustrated by rules, he will drift\naimlessly.\nWe also have a tax situation where, except for a previously discussed capital\ngains benefit given to a restricted class of patent holders, there is no opportunity\nfor the research organization or the individual investor to recoup from his suc\ncesses the costs of his unsuccessful experiments, thus insuring funds for further\nwork. The newly formed Academy of Applied Science is hard at work analyz\ning the real needs of inventors and commercial research institutions so that a\nsensible, planned tax incentive program can be suggested which will reward and\nstimulate the ultimate goal of successful innovation.\n29\"Ingenuity: A Quality of Victory,\" The Technology Review, Vol. 64, No. 8, pp. 35, 36\n(June, 1962).\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nWhere is the incentive today?\nOf course, a few of the more hardy will\nalways go ahead and take risks.\nBut is it any wonder that in the office of\nmany patent lawyers are new ideas for further development that are not being\nactively exploited? Or that the inventor today is wary of sinking money into\nthe inventor's wild idea? Where is return? Where is his protection?\nIt is surprising that most new entrepreneurs go to the government for spon\nsorship, and then get tied down to work only on those things which the gov\nernment employees dare to authorize. Rarely can they work on the radical and\nunusual things that have seemed \"impossible\" but that have given rise to the\ncreation of new industry in the past, and rarely with the all-important freedom\nto take advantage of serendipity, for exploring the unexpected discoveries of a\nproject often more important than the original goal?\nIs it any wonder that\nmany clients are not interested in adapting their own commercial advances to\ngovernment purposes 30?\nIt is ironical that the totalitarian menace to our way of life should be encour\naging research and invention when we are in the process of destroying the patent\nsystem and encouraging the piracy of proprietary rights. The part played by\nthe courts is believed to be the most significant agent in such encouragement,\nsince its checks and balances should have been used to correct the abuses by\nother branches of government that have gone hog wild. The real crux of the\nsituation is explained frankly by Justice Douglas:\nThe Justice comes to formulate his own views. The reexamination of\nprecedent in Constitutional law is a personal matter for each judge\nwho comes along 31 .\nIn keeping with this philosophy, apparently, such judges as a personal mat\nter, have determined that they do not agree with Article I, Section 8 of the\nConstitution, providing authority for the granting of patents. In a recent book,\nJohn P. Frank, former law clerk of Justice Black, frankly admits that \"Black has\npronouncedly unfavorable views on the patent system.\" In order to thwart this\n\"passion,\" the late Justice Stone, says Mr. Frank \"though he assigned Black\nmany good cases, . . . never assigned him one that had to do with patents 32.\"\nThe readiness of the present Supreme Court, moreover, to utilize \"particular\nconstitutional clauses to force states to conform to a social philosophy as policy\nespoused by a majority of the Supreme Court\" is well recognized 33 .\nIn a recent address before the American Bar Association, Justice Arthur\nGoldberg seemed to reiterate the philosophy of Black and Douglas, apparently\nalso shared at least by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William Brennan,\n30\"State Business - Where are the Tinkerers?\" Time, September 21, 1962, p. 81. \"Instead\nof innovation in the area of consumer products, there is modification and trimming up . . . stiff\ngovernment laws may be stifling inventiveness. . . . \"\n31William O.

Justice John\nMarshall Harlan, in rebuttal, cautioned however 34;\nOne of the current notions that holds subtle capacity for serious\nmischief is a view of the judicial function that seems increasingly\ncoming into vogue. This is that all deficiencies in our society which\nhave failed of correction by other means should find a cure in the\ncourts . . . Some well-meaning people apparently believe that the ju\ndicial, rather than the political, process is more likely to breed better\nsolutions of pressing or thorny problems. This is a compliment to\nthe judiciary, but untrue democratic principle.\nA judicial decision which is founded simply on the impulse that\n\"something should be done,\" or which looks no further than to the\n\"justice\" or \"injustice\" of a particular case, is not likely to have\nlasting influence . . . Our scheme of ordered liberty is based, like the\ncommon law, on enlightened and uniformly applied legal principle,\nnot on ad hoc notions of what is right or wrong in a particular case.\nThe one feature that has heretofore distinguished our system of government\nfrom that of totalitarian states has been that we were a nation of laws and not\nof men; that our rights were determined by some measure of legal precedent\nand not by the personal views of the judges. Now we have the anomaly where\npeople not even responsible to the electorate are able to foist their own personal\nprecepts upon the land - despite the Constitution.\nProfessor Rodell of the Yale Law School says:\nGranted great government power to be wielded for the rest of their\nlives with no real responsibility save to their own prejudice-propelled\nconsciences, the judges sometimes begin to mistake their separate\nselves, however liberal or conservative they may be, for God, and\nSupreme Court Justices are men 35 .\nAnd Professor Rodell points out case after case where the decision is based, not\non precedent, not on what the law is, not on what the Congress intends, but\non \"the judges' personal views on morals and ethics.\" The way in which the\n\"passion\" referred to by Justice Jackson can take hold is thus made clear.\n6.7\nThe Task\nSuppose, for a moment, that there were in the judiciary judges desiring to find\nreasons to sustain the property rights authorized under Article I, Section 8 of\nthe Constitution, wherever proper and feasible, much as the courts jealously\nprotect personal liberties under another Constitutional provision - the Fifth\n34Reported in Time, August 23, 1963, p. 17.\n35Fred Rodell, Nine Men, Random House, 1955.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nAmendment.\nThe large corporations would then no longer dare to defy the\nindividual inventor so cavalierly. And venture capital would be encouraged to\nback new ideas, because of the assurance that the patent, when granted, would\nhave a real chance of being sustained. Our economic advantage would thereby\nbe stimulated, and without government subsidy.\nThe United States Government would no longer deny so readily the individ\nual inventor's claims nor violate so notoriously the proprietary rights of small\nbusiness. Outsiders would begin to think about government problems, knowing\nthat they would be rewarded for their work. The whole defense effort would\nbenefit, without all the thinking having to be sponsored by government funds.\nUnless reform from the judiciary itself takes place, however, it is difficult to\nsee how the court-sanctioned license to piracy can be checked, and the disastrous\nconsequences flowing therefrom. The recent history of the Patent Act of 1952,\nspecifically intended to curb certain Supreme Court techniques for destroying\npatents, shows that legislation, without a more positive and unmistakable char\nacter, cannot alone accomplish the desired end - and certainly not within a\nreasonably short period of time.\nThe Supreme Court, as previously stated,\nhas refused to hear case after case that would have led to a showdown on its\ninterpretation of the meaning of \"invention\" in the 1952 Act.\nTwo avenues to influence the courts may be open: first, the strongest kind\nof language from Congress with regard to protecting inventors' rights; and sec\nondly, new appointees to the bench who can win the respect of their colleagues\nbecause of their understanding of the inventive process and the requirements\nfor its nurture and encouragement.\nWe should not be content, moreover, merely to put the patent law back to\nwhere it was before the 1930's. We need constructive development by the courts\nto suit modern times, development that comes naturally in other branches of law\nwhich, unlike patents, have been moving forward. Contrast, for example, the\nSupreme Court disposition of patents upon the basis of Cellini's writing of an\ntiquity, in the Jungerson case, with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals\nfor the second circuit in 1892, on Edison's carbon-filament incandescent-lamp\npatent 36, where, despite the fact that\nall-glass globes, with lead wires passing through the glass and sealed\nwith it, had been used before . . . and although the prior art . . . indicated\n. . . the use of burners of high resistance and small radiating surface,\nand although pencils of carbon had been tried in imperfect vacua ..,\ninvention was found in the successful use of a carbon filament in an exhausted\nglass container. Edison had made it work!\nNot only would Bell, Edison, and Westinghouse not be inventors in the eyes\nof the present-day Supreme Court, but Marconi was even stripped of the title of\ninventor, some forty years after the fact. As stated, in that case, by dissenting\nJustice Frankfurter 37 ,\n36Edison Electric Light Co. v. U.S. Electric Lighting Co., 52 F. 300, 307, 308.\n37Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. U.S., 320 U.S. 1 (1943).\n\nCreate or Perish\nbecause a judge . . . is able to demonstrate by a process of intricate\nrationalization that anyone could have drawn precisely the interfer\nences that Marconi drew and that Stone hinted at on paper, the\nCourt finds that Marconi's patent was invalid. . . .\nand this, despite the fact that\nnobody except Marconi did in fact draw the right inferences that\nwere embodied into a workable boon for mankind.\nAnd then, stating the real reason for the court's decision:\nJudges . . . should [be] . . . vigilant against importing their own no\ntions of the nature of the creative process into Congressional legis\nlation, whereby Congress \"to promote the Progress of Science and\nuseful Arts\" has secured \"for limited times to . . . Inventors the ex\nclusive Right to their Discoveries.\"\nSo, also, in the case of the Westinghouse airbrake (Patent 88,929 and Reissue\nPatent 5,504), invention was recognized, though the idea of operating railway\nbrakes by air pressure and many of the devices employed in such operating had\nbeen conceived earlier, but not successfully applied, by others. Similar com\nments apply to the invention of barbed wire by J. S. Glidden (Patent 157,124)\n38; to the invention of the alternating-current loading coil Nikola Tesla 39; and\nto many other inventions which have helped companies to start up so to build\nthe America we have heretofore known 40 .\nIt does not take an experienced engineer or scientist to interpret the graph of\nFigure 9, which shows the fate of patents in the United States Supreme Court\nsince 1925.\nAnd what will happen if nothing effective is done?\nIn view of\nthe attitude of the Supreme Court in the period 1950-1952, one had only a 28\nper cent chance of winning on both validity and infringement in the District\nCourt, an 18 per cent chance of reversal of an unfavorable lower-court decision\nin the Court of Appeals, and no chance at all in the United States Supreme\nCourt.

The patent system, even though not always best\nsuited to our present needs, represents a primary source of material reward to\nthe creative engineer and scientist. To pass it by, or to refuse to become active\nin insisting upon its preservation, seems to me to be a serious mistake. It is up\nto the engineer and scientist to take an active interest in the patent system and\nto contribute the ideas vitally needed for its improvement, modernization, and,\nindeed, survival.\nThe difficulty is not with the concept of the system, but with an adminis\ntration and operation thereof not fully suited to current requirements or to the\ndirection of an unmistakable social trend apparently desired by most people.\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 7\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nThe possible effect upon our system of current planning for a com\nmon European patent is discussed in this chapter, with several of the\nauthor's views for modernizing and improving the American patent\nsystem and its administration.\nAt a time when most of the thinking at the United States Patent Office\nappears directed toward such matters as obtaining a new building, speeding up\nthe government's patent examination procedures, streamlining interference and\nother processes within the Office, and providing more incentive to skilled people\nto wish for Patent Office careers, our European friends are engaged in a far more\nbasic modernization program. More important than the details of the programs\nunder consideration in the United States and abroad is the spirit of enthusiasm\nand vigor of the European experiment. This spirit stems from a firm conviction\nthat the state benefits when individuals are encouraged and their proprietary\nrights are protected - concepts that, at least formerly, were an integral part\nof American pride and tradition. Serious revision of the basic concepts of a\npatent system to suit modern times cannot take place in the climate that we\nhave now created for ourselves; where, indeed, there are some who apparently\nare no longer sure that reward to the individual is consistent with the so-called\n\"public interest 1.\"\nLet us explore, briefly, the rather radical ideas in Western Europe with regard\nto the economic and social needs of a mid-twentieth-century patent system. In\ndoing this, we must bear in mind that the great postwar impetus is still at work\nin an awakened European Economic Community which filings aside the petty\nroadblocks of mere nationalism and refuses to retain long-established systems\nof a bygone era simply because they have been so long established.\n1A measure of this spirit seems now to have been kindled by S. Herbert Hollomon, Assistant\nSecretary of Commerce for Science and Technology, who has established a patent panel of the\nCommerce Technical Advisory Board to delve into these matters with a sense of urgency. Also,\nDr. Donald A. Schon, head of the Commerce Department, Office of Technical Services, and\nProfessor Charles Stark Draper, Chairman of the National Inventors Council, are instituting\nstudies.\n\nCreate or Perish\n7.1\nPresent Proposals for a Common European Patent and Judiciary\nIn an effort to meet the needs of a modern Europe, and despite the wide range\nof differences in national laws and requirements for the issuance of patents in\nBelgium, France, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg, and West Germany, these coun\ntries have banded together with the exciting purpose of trying to create a single\nEuropean patent. Appreciative of the limitations upon the courts of law in the\ngrowing maze of technology, but also cognizant of the necessity for the safe\nguards of the judicial process, these people propose a single European Patent\nOffice which will perform both administrative patent examining and judicial\nfunctions, complementing the processes of the national courts of law of the\nindividual countries.\nPreliminary plans 2 proposed by representatives of the respective govern\nments, and made more firm at the Berlin 1963 summer conference, are somewhat\nas follows:\nAn inventor may file for a single, common European patent either in the\nEuropean Patent Office directly or in any one of the national patent offices for\nforwarding to the European Patent Office. The international group of examiners\nstaffing this latter office, under financial support from all the member countries,\nfirst checks the formal sufficiency of the application papers and then forwards\nthe application to an International Patent Institute, probably at the Hague,\nwhere an international group of trained technical officers will make a novelty\nsearch and report on the closest prior art that can be found. No opinion will\nbe expressed, however, as to whether the claimed invention is or is not actually\na patentable invention in the light of this prior art. On the contrary, one of\nthe purposes of this novelty search is to enable the patent applicant himself\nto decide whether, in the light of the prior art, he actually has a patentable\ninvention and should maintain his application or whether his claims should be\nmodified to show more clearly how his inventive step is an advance over what\nhas been done before.\nThe European Patent office will then, as a matter of course, publish the\napplication as an initial grant, including the original or modified claims of the\napplicant together with the novelty search report of the International Patent\nInstitute. The public thus will know what the applicant is claiming and what\nprior art the international search has developed, and any interested member of\nthe public can make his own evaluation of such claim.\nThis published patent will automatically be treated as abandoned after five\nyears from publication unless either the applicant or a member of the public\nfiles a petition for a final examination and determination of the validity of the\npatent by the European Patent Office. Such a petition must be published so\nthat anyone interested in this patent-claim assertion may, within a limited time,\njoin in the petition and inform the European Patent Office of any prior art or\nother reasons for invalidity of which they are aware.\n2Committee of National Institutes of Patent Agents, \"European Convention for facilitating\nthe filing of applications for patents in respect of the same invention in several States and the\nexamination thereof,\" Unpublished draft, June 14, 1962.\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nThus, before making a final determination as to whether the initial scheme is\nor is not patentable, the European Patent Office examiners have before them not\nonly the results of the search of the International Patent Institute but also all\nthe prior-art references which the technical community of all the countries has\nbeen able to assemble. Prosecution of the claims will then place much as in the\nWest German, Dutch, or American systems, with rejections and amendments,\nand appeal to a special board of the European Patent Office for a final decision.\nOne reason for this two-stage procedure in the granting of the European\npatent is the fact that the average life span of patents in countries such as\nWestern Germany (voluntarily cut short by the failure to pay the successively\nincreasing renewal taxes) is about seven years. And the period elapsing between\nthe original filing of an application for a common European patent and the five-\nyear period for final examination is expected to approximate the same length\nof time.\nAt the end of that time, about half the patents will probably be\nabandoned, and the European Patent Office and the national courts will not\nbe cluttered with litigation over uneconomic or unimportant patents. A party\nbeing threatened by, or concerned with, an initial or preliminary patent grant,\nmoreover, does not have to wait for the patentee to descend upon him in order\nto obtain a binding determination of patent validity.\nUpon election to file for a common European patent, the applicant will\nbe barred from obtaining an individual national patent in any of the separate\ncountries. However, for the initial phases of this proposed program, the right\nto file for individual national patents is retained.\nIn the event that a suit for patent infringement is brought in any of the\nnational courts, after the publication of the initial patent by the European\nPatent Office but prior to final examination and final patent grant, the national\ncourts, with power to decide infringement only and not validity, must suspend\nproceedings to enable the European Patent Office to make its final examination\nand rule on validity. Should the European Patent Office decide that there is no\ninvention or that for some other reason the initial patent is invalid and no final\npatent of any kind can be granted, appeal may be made to a board of appeals\nof the European Patent Office, whose decision is final.\nEven after the final granting of a patent, and at any time during its life,\nthe public, and not merely an infringer, has the right to bring a suit before a\nspecial board of the European Patent Office for a declaration that the patent\nis invalid. And appeal to a European Patent Court staffed by internationally\nselected judges is available.\nOnce a final patent has been granted, however, the national courts may\nproceed with suits to determine whether the patent is infringed. If doubt as to\nvalidity is shown before such courts and if the validity board of the European\nPatent Office of the European Patent Court is also to consider the matter, the\nnational courts may, if they so desire, postpone infringement decisions until\nthe final decision on validity has been rendered by the European Patent Court.\nIn such infringement actions, the national courts may request the European\nPatent Office to act as an expert as to technical matters, including the scope\nof protection intended for a patent, or they may request the European Patent\n\nCreate or Perish\nCourt to interpret doubtful provisions of European patent law. The decision of\nthe courts as to infringement may be appealed to the national appellate courts,\nas in present-day fashion, but the final appeal will not be to the supreme courts\nof the individual countries but to the European Patent Court.\nInstead of waiting to be sued for infringement in a national court, moreover,\nany person who is concerned over whether or not he may be infringing a patent\nmay ask the before-mentioned special board of the European Patent Office to\ndeclare whether his product or process is an infringement. The resulting deter\nmination may be appealed to the same court, but a decision of the European\nPatent Court as to infringement is to be binding upon the national courts. Thus\nnational judicial sovereignty is being radically curtailed in an effort to establish\ncommon standards of validity and infringement and uniformity of law under the\nsupreme guidance of the European Patent Court.\nMore than this, litigation in the national courts and prosecution of eco\nnomically useless patents in the European Patent Office are to be minimized.\nSearches, examination, validity, and infringement proceedings are to be stream\nlined and standardized, as they must be if the present terrible waste of time,\neffort, and skilled manpower (involved in separate national patents, compet\ning patent offices, separate judicial procedures, and varying standards) is to be\neliminated.\nThese radical and far-reaching modernizing steps, in the race for survival\nwith an aggressive, enthusiastic, and hostile competitive society 3, are being\nconsidered abroad at a time when, in the United States, there is more concern\nwith putting the law back to where it was forty years ago; with having a spank\ning new building for the Patent Office; and with speeding up the searching and\ncutting short negotiations between attorneys and the Patent Office. Indeed, we\nseem to consider ourselves clever enough to produce the \"valid\" final patent in\nshorter and shorter time, despite the increasing problems involved: obtaining\nand holding competent career examiners and the growing complexity of tech\nnology. This is how we have always done it, and apparently all that is needed\nto introduce time-study and efficiency \"experts\" and computers to speed up the\nprocess.\nA lesson for present-day American from its elders can be gleaned: namely\nto concern ourselves with substance, not form, and not to cling to procedures\nand format which have proved themselves long out-dated economically, socially,\nand politically 4 .\nThe economic and political effect upon the United States of real progress in\nthe competent administration and sympathetic protection of industrial property\nin Europe is another issue with which apparently few, if any, in government are\npresently concerned. If America is to be a world \"leader\" forging \"new frontiers\"\nin fact, and not merely in fine words, platitudes, and wishful thinking, it must\nshore up the sagging foundations of our free-enterprise capitalistic society before\n3Edward E. McGrath, \"How Should the U.S. React to Reds 'Man-in-Space Feat',\" Boston\nGlobe, April 13, 1961.\n4Report No. 148 of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 87th Congress, 2d Session\n(1962), p. 12: \"The very survival of the patent system, as it now exists, is at stake.\"\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nadding floors to the superstructure.\nWhat are the reasons behind our out-dated Patent Office procedures and\nthe general hostility or lack of interest and a sympathy for industrial property\nprotection from top to bottom of our judiciary? It is no accident that both Re\npublicans and Democratic judges are less than cordial to patents and complaints\nas to unfair competition predicted upon proprietary rights. It is no accident that\nvast groups of our industrial society have become less than enthusiastic about\npatents and about fighting to maintain their proprietary rights. It is no accident\nthat our engineering community is far from \"on fire\" and, like many other groups\nin our society, looks for security rather than for the excitement and adventure\nof its work with dreams of giant rewards.\nBy recent interviews of applied scientists and engineers in university, govern\nment, large corporation, and small company electronics laboratories in greater\nBoston, interviews conducted by my classes in invention, patent, and innovation\nat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and analyzed by the Academy of\nApplied Sciences, a shocking apathy was uncovered. Those working under gov\nernment sponsorship or employment felt no personal incentive from the patent\nsystem and, indeed, showed no concern for patents whatsoever since the latter\nwould be the property of the government. In many cases, they reported that\nthe lack of recognition of their personal efforts, coupled with the great difficulty\nin persuading superiors to try out something new or radically different, was\nresponsible for their attitude of doing a day's work for a day's pay.\nIn one major space laboratory, it was frankly conceded that if the germ\nof a really novel concept came to mind, it would be brought to completion in\nother commercial company endeavors outside the NASA program, because of\nthe grab-all patent policy of the government. This puts a premium on solving\nNASA's problems safely and regularly. Three patents applications, to be sure,\nhave been filed in the past four years out of the millions of dollars of space\nresearch conducted by this laboratory; but the commercial section of the same\ncompany has filed hundreds of such applications during the same period.\nMuch as the government patent policies have quashed creative ingenuity, so\nthe company employment agreements have reduced the interest of the engineers\nin inventing. Two principal reasons for this lack of incentive were advanced:\nfirst, the companies resist really new ideas; and second, the reward and recog\nnition procedures are actually not tied to creativity. Most of the commercial\ncompany engineers and applied scientists who were interviewed stated that they\npresently had some rather new ideas that they felt would be useful as products\nfor their companies. But they were not even suggesting them because of the\ndifficulty and even political danger in getting new ideas considered fairly and\naccepted. Possible inventions in fields outside their specific employment had\nalso occurred to many of those interviewed; but the universal explanations for\ndoing nothing about them were either that the company employment agree\nment made them the employer's property, or that the time, expense, and risks\ninvolved in our present patent system were formidable. Many felt, moreover,\nthat any recognition would go to others higher up on the company ladder. Are\nindustry and government managers awake to this lack of morale; or don't they\n\nCreate or Perish\nrealize its effect? The prevalent American management concept of equality of\ntalent and interchangeability of applied scientists and engineers saps at the roots\nof creative accomplishment. Flowers will not bloom without roots! 5 .\n7.2\nSome Different Ideas for Revision of the American Patent System\nLooking, then, at the foundation of our American patent system, I question\nwhether it is suited to hold up the social order of today and tomorrow. The\nsystem cannot but crumble if it rests upon fundamental concepts not in tune\nwith modern trends. It is of no use to long for \"the good old days,\" because most\nAmericans, rightly or wrongly, have unmistakably shown in modern elections\nthat they wish to adopt a different kind of social structure.\nSo, unless the\npurposes and effect of the patent system are matched to modern trends, the\ngood that resides, even in an out-dated patent system may disappear.\nWe should question, for example, whether it is sensible, in all instances, to\ngive to certain large corporations the same amount of power of exclusion in a\npatent that is given into smaller hands for the establishment of new businesses\nor growth. Is it not perhaps a terrible waste to have one branch of government\n(the Patent Office) grant a right after years of consideration and then to have\nanother branch (the Antitrust division of the Department of Justice) limit or\nabolish such right? Isn't this particularly true where the trend of Supreme Court\nthinking is directed, not toward real antitrust violations, but to the possession\nof instruments that, if improperly used, could conceivably result in violations\n6?\nWe should question whether, as the country proceeds unmistakably along\nthe path of more and more federal supervision, in accordance with the will of\nthe majority, the same social purpose is served by our present type of patents\nfor inventions in the highly sensitive field of public health as exists in other\nless sensitive fields of industrial products.\nThe must be examined because,\nthough the late Senator Estes Kefauver was unsuccessful in his attack upon\npharmaceutical patents in 1962, the handwriting is on the wall to be read 7 .\nThe engineering, scientific, legal, and business communities of the nation\nshould now, before it is too late, explore policies that can preserve the impor\ntant stimuli of the patent system even under conditions where the public is\nhighly sensitive. We who are generally friendly to the patent system shall have\nperformed a disservice to future generations if we refuse to examine our present\nform of patent system to see if it is any longer as meaningful and proper in\nour present society as it was in the early part of this century. We shall have\nperformed a further disservice if we do not plan to integrate our patent system\nwith that of the European Economic Community.\nWith regard to the procedures, indeed, it seems that our emphasis ought\nto be making the path of the inventor easier in the Patent Office, rather than\n5Robert H. Rines, \"Current Problems in the Protection of Creative Ideas and Writings,\"\nIEEE International Convention Record, Part 10 (1963).\n6United States v. Dupont & Co., 366 U.S. 316 (1961).\n7Science, Vol. 134, pp. 89-90 (July 19, 1961).\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\napproaching the problem solely from the present point of view of making it easier\nand quicker for the government to speed up its consideration of patents. Neither\nthe Patent Office examiners nor any other group of individuals can do creative\nwork in an atmosphere of speed. In fact, the examiners should better be given\nmore time for thorough consideration of the matter of patentability and the\napplication of the judicial tests of obviousness and other standards of invention,\nif judges are to be asked to give great weight to the examiners' conclusions.\nSpeed is not, and never has been, a substitute for thorough work; and so we\nmust decide whether the issuing of good patents is more or less important than\nthe prompt issuing of large numbers of possibly inferior patents. This, again, is\nthe question: Is America interested in substance or in mere form?\nLet us consider, therefore, another approach predicated upon the hypothesis\nthat a patent examiner is not just a servant of the public at large, but under\nthe very constitutional provisions whereby the patent system exists also has\na responsibility to the individual inventor.\nHe should not engage merely in\nthe destructive process of rejection, but should speed the process of patent\nexamination through active assistance to inventors, in order that patents be\nissue promptly when invention appears to be present. It should be as important\nfor an examiner to feel content when assisting an inventor in obtaining a patent\nwith claims of proper scope as it is now for many examiners when sustained by\nthe Board of Appeals in a rejection.\nTo this end, a reformulation of present Patent Office practice can be made\nby administrative order of the commissioner which will take into account the\nlong-overlooked Patent Office responsibility to the inventor. Specifically, when\nan examiner is convinced that an invention is present but is dissatisfied with the\nclaims of the applicant, he should be required to suggest different claims or call\nfor an interview for the purpose of formulating such claims with the inventor\nor his counsel. This is the common practice of the West German Patent Office.\nAnd this is the healthy way to speed prosecution, a much better way than\narbitrarily limiting the applicant to two Patent Office actions, as now proposed\nin so-called \"compact\" patent prosecutions.\nCould we also move a step further in order to expedite prosecution and\neliminate the necessity for so many appeals before the Board of Appeals and\nthe courts? When the Patent Office is convinced that invention is present, but\nagreement as to the working of the claim cannot be reached with the inventor's\ncounsel, might not the Patent Office thereupon give the applicant his choice:\neither suffer a final rejection or accept a prompt patent containing a claim of\nthe scope that seems proper to the Patent Office; but including in the patent\ndocument claims not approved by the Office but which the applicant still feels\ndescribe the invention more fairly.\nThe whole purposed of claims is to alert the public as to the metes and\nbounds of the patent grant. No one, from reading a claim, however, understands\nwhat the claim covers or what if actually means without recourse by skilled\ncounsel to the file history of the patent.\nSince counsel must study this file\nhistory to interpret the claims anyway, it would seem that he could equally\nwell determine whether the claim granted by the Patent Office under this new\n\nCreate or Perish\nproposal was broad enough, or whether the inventor's claim represent more\nadequate allowable protection. The public can thus be alerted as to what the\ncourt will probably hold with regard to the ultimate scope of the patent, which\nseems to be the only reason for having claims in the first place.\nHealthy expedition of patent applications prosecution and the elimination of\nmuch appellate procedure would appear to be the dividends accruing from such\na system. This would be particularly true where the matter of presumption of\nvalidity (which would only attach to the Patent Office allowed claims) is purely\na procedural benefit as interpreted in practice by the modern courts.\nAnother suggestion I would offer for expediting patent application prosecu\ntion is also peculiarly within the province of the commissioner to accomplish,\nnamely to abolish some of the ritualistic and formalistic rules of claim drafts\nmanship. While at one time in our development of the law it was probably\nsound to adopt greater strictness in this regard, in order to introduce clarity\nand definiteness and to establish how claims should be construed, I question\nwhether this is still valid 8 .\nIn the 1952 Patent Act, Congress went part way in authorizing functional\nclaim language (\"means\" plus function), with a statutory provision that this is to\nbe interpreted to cover the kind of structure disclosed in the patent specification\nand equivalents. This was intended to curb court criticisms and to simplify claim\ndrafting, consistent with permitting proper scope of coverage.\nShould we not also remove, however, the time-consuming obstacles involved\nin trying to connect and agree with the Patent Office upon broad claim ter\nminology, simply because the rules forbid the use of alternative or illustrative\nexpressions, to wit; \"of metal or plastic or wood or the like,\" or \"such as elec\ntrical or mechanical or electro-mechanical members,\" etc?\nShouldn't we re\nexamine these expressions to see whether they actually introduce indefiniteness\nand vagueness, or whether, on the contrary, they do clarify what is intended?\nAn additional proposal relates to encouraging prompt disclosure of ideas\nwithout fear of litigation and appropriation. It is doubtful if any agency outside\nthe Patent Office receives so many new ideas. The Patent Office, moreover,\ngenerally receives these ideas years in advance of their publication either in\nperiodicals or in pieces of commercial equipment; and certainly the long delay\nin the issuance of patents prevents the rapid informing of the public as to the\ncontents of the applications. Is it in the public interest that our system, which\nrequires in this era acceleration in new-product and in new-idea development,\nshould be stymied by the secrecy with which these ideas must be held in the\nPatent Office until the inventor dares to risk disclosure?\nI have proposed 9 that the Patent Office or a related arm of the Commerce\nDepartment should assume the added function of lending its good offices for\nbringing together promptly inventor and interested potential licensee under a\npredetermined set of safeguards. The inventor must, of course, be free to refuse\n8Robert H. Rines, \"Recent Attitudes - Judicial, Executive, and Legislative - Foreshadowing\nthe Demise of the Present Form of American Patent System,\" Bulleting of the Canadian\nPatent Institute, January, 1962.\n9Ibid.\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nthis proposal if he so desires, and to proceed as he does now. If, however, he\nwishes the benefit of this proposal, he would agree (1) that the details of his\ninvention may be brought to the attention of possible licensees subscribing to a\nPatent Office service and (2) that, should the potential licensee be interested,\nthe inventor agrees to terms as provided in a predetermined set of royalty or\nother payment standards related to the industry involved.\nThose who wish to be subscribers to or recipients of this confidential infor\nmation as potential licensees, on their part, will agree to keep the disclosures in\nconfidence and, if they decide to adopt the ideas and if the Patent Office grants\na patent covering the same, to respect the patent and to enter into arrangement\nunder the provisions of the predetermined set of standards. The potential li\ncensees subscribing to this service would have the right to call to the attention\nof the Patent Office any prior art or prior use of which they are aware so that\nthe examiner would not inadvertently issue a patent where it should not be\ngranted. This procedure protects the potential licensee and should not hold up\nthe prosecution of the patent applications. The potential licensee would still\nhave rights to contest infringement, or to contest inventorship on the basis of\nany application then pending, but this right should probably be restricted to\npending applications in order to protect the inventor from interference contestd\non matters that the license may have independently previously evolved but did\nnot consider important enough to act upon.\nThis would also encourage the\npotential licensee to file more punctually and thus disseminate more rapidly\ninformation beneficial for the progress of the useful arts. Toward the same end,\nmoreover, beneficial tax provisions might be provided, though this would not\nbe a necessary or required condition.\nUnder such a system, inventors would feel free to have subscribing potential\nlicensees examine their inventions and, by subsequent direct contact, further\nconfidential information not contained in the patent application, without fear\nof legal entanglements. This should also protect potential licensees from being\nheld up by inventors who demand an unreasonable price; and it also protects\nthe potential licensees with respect to their own independent developments and\nto the prevention of inadvertent issuance of patents.\nAll of this may be accomplished, moreover, by the utilization of the type of\nexaminer presently employed in the classification division. Such examiners are\nskilled in determining the field and nature of inventions, as they are filed, and\nare able to correlate the same with requests that will similarly be filed by the\nsubscribing potential licensees. It would appear to be in the decided interest\nof the United States Government itself to subscribe to this service. In such\nevent, indeed, a great many of the present-day complications and distrust of the\ngovernment by inventors could be eliminated.\nSince the rules of practice of the Patent Office, made pursuant to the statu\ntory authorization of the patent laws, have long recognized the right of the\nPatent Office to permit others to inspect applications, provided permission is\ngiven in writing by the applicant, no new legislation or other action on the part\nof Congress would seem to be required to institute this program. Rather, it\nwould appear to be peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the commissioner of\n\nCreate or Perish\npatents to set up such a liaison function. The Patent Office has already as\nsumed jurisdiction of a somewhat similar, though less comprehensive program,\nin connection with inviting attention to patents that are available for licensing.\nThis proposal, moreover, goes far beyond the concept of the National Inven\ntors Council and the products list circular of the Small Business Administration,\nand should stimulate inventors to complete their thinking on ideas that relate\nnot only to their own businesses or fields of endeavor, but to entirely diverse\nfields; all with assurance that such disclosure is worthwhile and does not involve\nthe likelihood of costly legal procedures and litigation.\nIf we are to enjoy the luxury of having many of our best engineers and\nscientific people work in fields and on devices that have no bearing on pressing\nproblems in military and other high-priority fields, we must find some incentive\n- the above system or something like it - which will impel these engineers\nand scientists to work on problems not immediately concerned with their daily\nduties. Certainly the important inventions that have been contributed in various\nfields by workers outside those fields demonstrate the value of such a result. This\nmay be part of the answer to the problem of maintaining our freedom to select\nwhat we wish to work on in our daily lives, while competing more effectively\nwith the Soviet society, where the very best brains are forced to work upon\nmilitary and other pressing state problems.\nLastly, we should explore more promptly whether the patent system can\never be adequate as virtually the only universal government reward for advance\nments in the useful arts. Scientists and engineers are stimulated to creativity, of\ncourse, by mechanisms other than the patent system, including an enthusiasm\nfor science or technology itself, the approbation of the scientific or engineering\ncommunity, the publication of papers, the winning of a Nobel prize, and the\nattainment of a higher position in an organization. Privately sponsored efforts\ntoward this goal of providing reward and recognition for various degrees of cre\native advances in applied science and engineering, as distinguished from those\nof pure science, are under way under the auspices of The Academy of Applied\nScience.\nFurthermore, we should select that situation dealing with the useful arts\nand applied science in which monetary, business, and prestige rewards can\nbe achieved through patents and modernize the patent system so that it will\neffectively satisfy present needs and provide the stimulation necessary to re-\nencourage creativity in the mid-twentieth century applied scientific and engi\nneering community 10 .\nMost important, however, we should decide promptly whether it is invention\nper se that we should stimulate primarily, or the executing of actual innovation\n- requiring development and entrepreneuring, as well 11 .\nIf it is the latter,\n10Note also the suggestions of Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, \"Science, Man, and Politics,\" Saturday\nReview of Literature, Oct. 20, 1962, p. 24, concerning the necessity for talented scientific\npeople to become actively interdisciplinary in this era where \"the dominant influence of science\nis perhaps the outstanding fact of today's world.\"\n11Not all \"innovation\" requires invention. Should we not seek to define \"innovation,\" if this\nis what we are after, and reward it?\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nas I strongly suspect, then perhaps a keying of tax-preference benefits to the\ninnovator over a period of years, rather than the creation of exclusive rights and\na belaboring of the patent system, will be a more effective stimulant which, as\nan ancillary benefit, would carry with it great simplification of our litigation\nproblems.\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 8\nCourt Modernization for Aiding the Patent\nSystem and the Law, in General\nSince there is a decided legal, as well as technical, side to the prob\nlems of patents and of protecting proprietary rights, a pin-pointing\nof difficulties in our current system of judiciary review is necessary\nin the interest of completeness. This is done here in language that\nthe nonlawyer also can understand. Included are some suggestions\nthat would have far-reaching effects for patent litigants as well as all\nthose having property rights.\nThe suggestions for improving the attitude of the courts toward the property\nrights of the creative individual, in order restore incentive to our present patent\nsystem, are arrived at perhaps piecemeal.\nIf the Supreme Court's hostility\nto or disinterest in patents is overcome, there may still remain other personal\nprejudices relating to other facets of the law.\nA more generalized proposal\nfor trying to remedy all these disturbing influences is thus in order, especially\nsince we recognize the fact that the complexion of the court cannot be changed\novernight.\n8.1\nThe Nature of the Criticism\nAltogether apart from partisan or ethnic dissatisfaction with decisions of the\nSupreme Court in particular cases (which will probably always persist but may\nperhaps be tempered by a better selection of justices from many legal fields and\nexperiences) there are serious, more deep-seated worries among legal profession\nals. They are naturally reluctant to criticize the august institution, not because\nof undue awe for the intellects or judicial perspicacity of the appointees to the\nhigh bench but, rather, because of the importance of the historically stabilizing\neffect of prior courts upon our way of life.\nInformed criticism of the conduct of the Supreme Court covers a wide range.\nSome critics feel, generally, that the number of cases crowding the court makes\nimpossible well-considered, well-written decisions, worthy of respect. Profes\nsor Henry M. Hart, Jr., of the Harvard Law School, has presented \"The Time\n\nCreate or Perish\nChart of the Justices 1\" showing the actual impossibility of reaching conscien\ntious, erudite decisions under present conditions, quite apart from fair play for\nlitigants. Under Professor Hart's assumptions, the justices, if in fact they do\nstudy all petitions and appeals, can give each of 1300-odd annual petitions for\nwrit of certiorari and appeals about ten minutes' consideration 2:\nOthers feel that they court pays little attention to, and indeed is disposed to\nignore, many, many fields vital to our way of life, including patents, copyrights,\nand property rights in general, in favor of multitudes of perhaps nationally\ntrivial, minor abuses of other kinds of rights 3 . Among the justices themselves,\nindeed, there appears to be great resentment over the conversion of the Supreme\nCourt into an appellate tort court:\nTo review individualized personal injury cases, in which the sole issue\nis sufficiency of the evidence, seems to me not only to disregard the\nCourt's proper function, but to deflect the Court's energies from the\nmass of important and difficult business properly here 4 .\nMany lawyers object strenuously to the philosophy that justices - appointed\nfor life - should foist upon an electorate their own personal views as to matters\nof social, economic, and legal conduct. Still others decry the lack or respect\namong certain justices for legal precedent, the legislative functions of Congress,\nand the historic duty of the Supreme Court to try, at least, to bring some mea\nsure of stability and order to our judicial and legal processes. In the Holmes\nLectures at Harvard in 1958, Judge Learned Hand frankly explained this dan\ngerous condition:\nI trust it is not disrespectful to say that I find it impossible to predict\nwhat attitude the Court would take towards a statute of which it\nmuch disapproved even where it concerned economic issues only; and\n... the answer becomes decidedly more obscure when the statute\ntouches those other interests, now called \"Personal Rights 5.\"\nHow correct was Mr.\nJustice Roberts' earlier prediction in Mahnich v.\nSouthern S.S. Co. 6:\nThe evil resulting from overruling earlier considered decisions must\nbe evident. In the present case, the court below naturally felt bound\n173 Harvard Law Review, pp. 84 - 125 (1959).\n2By the same computation formula, the ten minutes had been whittled down in 1960 and\n1961. 74 Harvard Law Review, pp. 99, 100 (1960) and 75 Harvard Law Review, pp. 85, 86\n(1961).\n3Robert H. Rines, \"Some Legal Considerations in Presenting Technical Information,\" In\nstitute of Radio Engineers Transactions, Vol. EWS-2, No. 3, pp. 84-88 (1959); Harry G.\nHehn, \"Current Developments in Copyright Law,\" American Bar Association Ninth Annual\nSymposium on Copyright, p. 10.\n4Mr.\nJustice Stewart, Sentilles v.\nInter-Carribean Shipping Corp., 361 U.S. 107, 111\n(1959).\n5\"Personal Rights\" refers to the Bill of Rights.\n6321 U.S. 96, 113 (1944).\n\nAiding the Patent System and the Law\nto follow and apply the law as clearly announced by this court. If\nlitigants and lower federal courts are not to do so, the law becomes\nnot a chart to govern conduct but a game of chance; instead of set\ntling rights and liabilities it unsettles them ... and ... the deplorable\nconsequence will inevitably be that the administration of justice will\nfall into disrepute. Respect for tribunals must fall when the bar and\nthe public come to understand that nothing that has been said in\nprior adjudication has force in a current controversy.\nAnd coupled with this is the apparent philosophy that the ends of justice\nare served by attaining the desired result of favoring or disfavoring a class of\nlitigant, even if this is done on the flimsiest of rationalization. In the words of\none of our ablest federal judges 7:\nIn my opinion there was no evidence whatsoever of negligence on the\npart of the engineer. I cannot read the record as a whole in a way\nto find any evidence of negligence. But I know that my method of\nreading the record is different from that of a majority of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States as exhibited in past cases, and I hope I\nam a lawful judge, and I recognize the limits of my authority, whether\nappellate judges do or not.\nThe host of relatively recent Congressional countermands of the effects of the\nSupreme Court decisions demonstrates, others point out, an unhealthy conflict.\nThe readiness of certain justices to overturn long-established and well-considered\nlaw and legal rules, to attain a given result, has been particularly frustrating to\nconscientious law-enforcement officers, also. Recent episodes of this character\nare illustrated by Rios v. United States and Elkins et al v. United States 8 .\nUnder this procedure, we may expect newly fashioned reversals of law every\ntime that the court changes its members, or the members change their personal\nviews.\nAs another illustration: in reviewing the past two decades, without first\nlooking at the actual decisions of the Supreme Court, I found it possible to pre\ndict with almost 100 per cent accuracy, which justices would ultimately decide\nagainst the patentee. And this was true even in the absence of knowledge as to\nthe merits or issues of a patent case or a case in which a patentee was somehow\ninvolved.\nWhile recognizing the necessity for the justices to exercise discretion in mat\nters of certiorari, many lawyers protest the clear usurpation of Constitutional\npower by the court in declining to hear matters concerning which the Consti\ntution directs that the Supreme Court \"shall have the appellate Jurisdiction.\"\nIt declines by dismissing appeals for \"want of a substantial federal question.\"\nIf the work load is too onerous, some feel 9, it behooves the court to protest\n7Judge Charles E.

Whether a case involving a construction of a State statute that authorized\ndeprivation of a right to trial by jury by an order for a new trial, issued pursuant\nto a secret hearing, held without notice, in a locked private room of the court\nhouse from which counsel was deliberately excluded by a judge, presents no\n\"substantial federal question 13.\"\n2. Whether a case involving a novel construction of the Patent Act of 1952\nthat permitted the destruction of a patent for a device that the Court of Ap\npeals14 had to admit was (1) \"useful and ingenious,\" (2) \"not known prior,\" (3)\nhad \"solved these problems\" of the prior art, and (4) had \"commercial success\"\n(in short, all the tests heretofore known to the law for demonstrating patentable\ninvention) was of import for decision; particularly where, under similar circum\nstances, other Courts of Appeals had interpreted the Act contrarily, and the\nparties before such Courts of Appeals joined with plaintiff in seeking a first\ninterpretation from the Supreme Court of the Act 15 .\n3.

It appears\nthat this has had the support of some of the courts and some members of\nCongress 18 . But it has evoked serious objection by those who believe that it is\nvitally necessary for the federal courts to exercise such jurisdiction 19 . Though\na compromise in the raising of the jurisdictional sum from $3,000 to $10,000\nwas adopted, our troubles still persist.\nJustice Harlan has proposed increasing the number of law clerks. Certainly\nthis should be done in any event - but not to substitute the views of law clerks\nfor those of the justices as to whether or not a case should be heard, or as to the\ndecision to be rendered. Others have suggested that administrative assistants\nof commissioners be given to the court, or experienced lawyers be appointed\nto aid the justices in the pursuit of their tasks 20 . These proposals, however,\nclearly cannot obviate the real difficulties before recounted, as pointed out by\nthe late Justice Jackson 21 .\nStill other suggestions for an enlarged court and for sitting in sections of\nchambers have been found wanting 22 .\n17McKenna v. Seaton, 259 F. 2d 780, certiorari denied, 358 U.S. 835 (1958). The gravity\nof the question involved was described by dissenting Judge Prettyman (p. 786). \"The basic\nproblem is the 'rule of law.' We have laws - either statutes or rules legally adopted - and we\nare supposed to be governed by them. If our governors merely do whatever strikes them as\njust and fair and reasonable at the moment, we have rule by men instead of by law. These\nare no cliches. Rule by law alone is the precise essential which differentiates our system from\nthe totalitarian system. ...

Such an Intermediate\nCourt of Appeals with the Supreme Court as a tribunal above it, would not be\ndisposed to foist its personal views upon the public or to decide cases on other\nthan legal precedents and principles. Some measure of stability and uniformity\nin the law, moreover, could thus be introduced and many facets of our way of\nlife, including property rights, no longer ignored.\nThis, moreover, would leave the Supreme Court free to hear mandatory\nappeals and the very occasional cases certified from, or through, such an In\ntermediate Court of Appeals. Perhaps, indeed, the mandatory field could be\nrestricted or limited (as the court has done for itself by the \"insubstantial federal\nquestion\" doctrine) and all cases relegated to the realm of certiorari - somewhat\nas in the New York appellate practice. Special provision, in certain limited cases,\nfor sidetracking the Intermediate Court of Appeals and proceeding directly to\nthe Supreme Court might also be provided.\nThis proposal, it appears to me, might to a long way toward solving the\ndifficulties before recounted, yielding a stabilizing single-court review, to which\nour citizenry is entitled and which the Constitution contemplated, but releasing\nthe Supreme Court itself from all cases but those that it should be required to\nhear and carefully to consider and decide. The proposal could serve, moreover,\nto protect the court from most of the citizenship-diversity appeals that clutter\nits schedule, and as to which there has been great criticism.\nAncillary benefits from such an intermediate tribunal would inure in other\ncases of jurisdictional dispute between the Supreme Court justices, as in Florida\nLime and Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Jacobsen, et al.\n24, where the objection\nwas raised by Justices Frankfurter and Douglas that the effect of the decision\nof a three-judge District Court enjoining a State statute on the grounds of its\nunconstitutionality not only serves to expand the Supreme Court's\nobligatory jurisdiction but contradicts the dominant principle of hav\n98 - 101 (1928); Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S. 1392, p. 1871,\n75th Congress, 1st Session(1937).\n23Robert H.

At this time, I would like to stress that this is\nbut one small part of a much larger picture. In fact, if this picture were viewed\nas a work of pointlisne, that school of painting in which the whole is developed\nby the employment of thousands of small dots of color instead of brush strokes,\npatent reform would be but a single though arresting dot.\nThe larger pictures is that after developing an industrial technology that can\nand has outproduced the world - after investing sixteen billion dollars annually\nin research - what this nation would seem to have acquired is a sure-fire formula\nfor economic decline.\nIf there is any doubt that our creative industrial capability is standing still -\nand to stand still is to lose ground in modern technology - consider that for the\nthird successive time in as many decades the automobile industry again appears\nas the only prime mover capable of pulling the country out of the economic\ndoldrums. But this time it is increasingly evident that even that great industry,\nno matter how prodigious and brilliant its performance, cannot single-handedly\nabsorb all the unemployed and lift the gross national product growth rate to\nthe desired and necessary level.\nWhile we have always considered ourselves as the most inventive of all mod\nern nations - with the telephone, the combine harvester, the electric lamp, the\nmass-produced airplane and automobile as icons of this faith - the truth of the\nmatter is that modification rather than innovation has become the accepted rule\nin American industry. Plastics, processed foods, outboard motors and synthetic\ntextiles all appeared in the marketplace before World War II.\n9.1\nThe Pity of Serendipity\nDespite vast expenditures in research and the siren song of serendipity with its\npromise that our probings into space would result in unexpected discoveries,\nthat they would unlock a cornucopia flow of new, amazing, and revolutioniz\n\nCreate or Perish\ning products that would change all prior concepts of living and accelerate the\neconomy at a rate never envisioned before, nothing more remarkable than some\ncooking utensils can be traced directly to this mighty effort. And even here the\nmanufacturer denies NASA's claim that these articles are a result of space re\nsearch. The fact is that American technology has not developed a major product\nthat every family has felt a compelling need to acquire since television.\nNot only is private industrial research not paying off, but the expected spill\nover from the titanic technological expenditures of the government has yet to\nappear.\nOne of my friends, who has never been an alarmist, said that he didn't real\nize the trouble we are in until seeing the furor in print that greeted the advent\nof colored film for the Land Polaroid camera. \"It certainly is a distinguished\nand creditable accomplishment, but the only thing 'awesome' about it is that\nNewsweek should use that word to describe it.\" He went on to say that nothing\nhe had read had so disturbed him since Calvin Coolidge's 1928 pronouncement\nthat the miniature golf boom of that year would prevent any recession or de\npression.\n9.2\n\"Mind-Forged Manacles\"\nThere has been some expressed concern. A member of the President's cabinet\nhas admitted that \"international competition is beginning to run rings around\nus. The nation's research effort is not producing the new consumer products, the\nnew machines, the new industrial process that the country needs for a growing\nhealthy economy.\"\nScientists in top management posts are not unduly alarmed. \"There is an\nadequate base for pure research, but is has just not been applied,\" insists the\ndirector of long range planning for an industrial giant noted for its research\ndepth. Other august opinions are: \"We are not lacking in the capability to\ninvent. Where we have trouble is in the incentive to invent.\" and \"Increasing\nthe economic rewards would give a real lift to U.S. inventiveness.\n. . . It's a\nmatter of getting the risks and incentives into balance.\"\nUnfortunately there is more to the matter than just getting risks and incen\ntives into balance. If this were all, patent reform and recognition by the courts\nand government of the risks involved could probably restore the old incentives\nthat in the first stages of the technological revolution enabled America to race\nahead and provide a stream of goods on a scale never seen before. It was a time\nwhen Thomas A. Edison, \"Tin-Lizzie\" Henry Ford , Willie \"Airbrake\" West\ninghouse, Alexander Graham Bell, Wilbur and Orville Wright were folk heroes\nand every other American youth dreamed of emulating them.\nToday, not a single contemporary inventor is a household name, and most\nindustry is so shackled with what William Blake termed \"mind-forged manacles\"\nthat it is extremely doubtful that Edison, Ford, or Bell would be employed and,\nif employed, allowed to function successfully by the companies that now bear\ntheir names - for all three were nonconformists in terms of what are now firmly\nestablished industrial management rules and personnel selection procedures.\n\nA Formula for Economic Decline\n9.3\n\"Conformity Is a Psychotic State\"\nApplied to the present state of industrial and technological organization in these\nUnited States and the mounting challenges we face, there may be more truth\nthan shock value in this diagnosis by playwright Clifford Odets. He insists rather\nviolently that \"this is the frontier that has to be opened. This is a new kind of\nCalvinism that allows no individualism. It is a frightening phenomenon and as\nrigid as any Calvin ever practiced.\"\nWhether this is a new kind of Calvinism and psychotic is certainly debatable,\nbut that conformity is the enemy of innovation is not. And since conformity is\nthe climate in most large business organizations, we may have pair far too high\na price for some of our greatly revered achievements in mass production and\nmanagement.\n9.4\nMental Containers\nAccording to office wits, nothing is more sacred to executives than a table-of\norganization chart. This is probably true, for the had of the nation's largest\nadvertising agency seemed to realize that he was treading on dangerous ground\nwhen he said, \"It never has been our idea that the organization structure should\nbe complicated or an end in itself.\"\nOrganization charts can be impressive\nand yet have no meaning - in fact can be restrictive. Whether or not a large\ncorporation or organization can function without charts to clarify the lines or\nexecutive responsibility has no bearing on creativity and inventive incentives -\nbut the outlined rectangles that dangle down like earring ornaments in these\npaper pyramids do.\nProbably the most effective mental container ever devised is the t.o. box -\nit lets little fresh thought in, and none out. If that is its main purpose, it is\ncertainly successful. But if the encouragement of creative thinking and action\nis an objective of a firm or organization, then it is the greatest barrier Man has\never erected against himself. Every week more ideas are smashed, squashed, and\nignored within four ruled sides than were suppressed by the Spanish Inquisition\nin the four centuries of that institution's existence.\nFormer Olympic diving champion Fred V. Zendar, now a consultant in\noceanic research for both government and private industry, recently made some\nrather penetrating comments on the subject of chains of command and lines of\ncommunication. He said, \"In all big organizations there is a submerged layer\nthat effectively blocks all communication from above and below. Oddly enough,\nsonar has detected a similar stratum of blocking water in the oceans, but here\nthe level itself doesn't remain stationary but periodically rises and sinks and\nsometimes parts.\"\nHe wrily added, \"No such phenomena seem to occur in\nits human counterpart.\" When asked what this layer is composed of, Zendar,\nwho was a favorite fishing and flying companion of Ernest Hemingway and who\ndoesn't mind putting his shots below the waterline, replied, \"In both cases, sus\npended silt. But I imagine if you examined it closely you'd find plankton and\ndead minute marine life in one; supervisors and paper-shufflers in the other.\"\n\nCreate or Perish\n9.5\nThe Degree Slide Rule Won't Work This Time\nCertainly if the aim is to reinvigorate creativity - and for industry and the nation\nto survive it must be - special attention must be paid to personnel procurement\nprocesses.\nIn educational circles there is already a wide divergence of opinion regarding\ncollege admission and aptitude test interpretations. Two University of Chicago\npsychologists hold that a high IQ is not a reliable sign of \"giftedness\" and may\nsimply indicate mental grey-flannelism. In one series of experiments they found\nthat 30 veritable Quiz Kids with IQs of about 150 showed few creative abilities,\nwhile an equal number in a much lower bracket were exceptionally good at\nputting facts into exciting new forms.\nAt Cambridge University in England, physical science students were found to\nbe less intellectually flexible than art specialists and more restricted emotionally.\nIt was found also that the ability to deal logically with facts and the ability to\nsee new ways of doing things do not necessarily go together.\nOf course, to a patent attorney, this is neither new nor surprising. The roll\ncall of great inventors reveals that the initial \"breakthrough\" discoveries were\noften the brain children of men singularly lacking in expert knowledge in the\nfields that they ultimately revolutionized. Or as Sir Henry Bessemer, inventor\nof the steel-making process that bears his name, put it, \"I had no fixed ideas\nderived from long established practice to control and bias my mind.\"\nAll of this indicates that if the genes of inventiveness are to be sought and\nrecognized, current yardsticks and measuring rules will have to be discarded.\nThis will, or course, call for re-education of the sternest sort and a complete\nre-orientation of management thinking. Up to now the employment interviewer\nand personnel procurement manager have been able to play it safe by operating\nwithin a few time-tested guidelines tailored to the safe customs, folkways, and\nbeliefs of this organization. Some of these shibboleths are unbelievable until one\naccepts the fact that every corporation is really a self-contained subculture.\nHere are a few gathered at random: a S.B. will fit one job . . . another rates\na Sc.M. . . . but a Sc.D. would be overqualified. . . . Anyone holding both a S.B.\nand LL.B. is apt to prove argumentative with his superiors. So far quite basic\nand undoubtedly time-tested.\nBut listen to these: a man who has worked\nthree different places in less than five years is either unstable or a \"drifter.\"\n. . . rockhunters are dependable. . . . drivers of low gas consuming compact cars\nare seldom absentees.\n. . . sports car addicts are just the opposite, but often\nmake good application engineers. . . . skiiers usually write good proposals.\nHow to press home the hard fact that the supposedly unstable man made\nthree changes because he found the tasks assigned boring and offering no chal\nlenge to his talents, or that one \"drifter\" is apt to prove more creative than fifty\nhandbook engineers or benchwarming drones is something that I would like to\ncall to the attention of the various schools of business administration and see\nwhat they come up with.\n\nA Formula for Economic Decline\n9.6\nA New Use for Senior Scientific Statesmen\nThat many established ways of doing things are held in place not by logic\nor even by habit but by the enormous restraining force of vested interests is\nacknowledged by all who have studied the problem. And in many cases, the\n\"vested interests\" of employees, particularly at the supervisory level, have been\nfound to be as strong as those of top executives, if not stronger.\nFor this reason instead of launching a direct attack on the deadly rigidity\nwhich stifles innovation and inventiveness in many organizations, or even at\ntempting to eradicate the choking underbrush of custom and precedent which\nsmothers originality, a new approach to the situation has been proposed and, in\nthe case of one government department, has been given a trial run. This new\napproach calls for the creation of a new profession which will function outside\nregular channels of administrative responsibility and lines of authority, will be\ncapable of gaining and maintaining the confidence of all employees, will be able\nto intimidate supervisory retaliation, and will at all times have access to and\nthe respect of top management.\nThis calls for a large order in a man. But fortunately there are ready and\navailable a number of men of this stature. These men are our senior scientific\nstatesmen who have passed the age of compulsory retirement in corporations\n(many of which they headed) and have reached emeritus standing in our great\ntechnical educational institutions.\nAmong their ranks are some of our most\nrenowned inventors, respected educators, experienced administrators, and orig\ninal thinkers in almost every scientific discipline. In the opinion of the Board\nof Governors of The Academy of Applied Science, these men represent a na\ntional resource which in our present predicament it would be treason to leave\nimmobile. It may be added that The Academy of Applied Science is compiling\na roster and setting up an activity that will make this great national resource\navailable to the country.\n9.7\nCreate or Perish\nWhile the particular problems I have enumerated in this summary would seem\nto be the particular province of management, boards of directors, stockholders,\nand possibly the investing public, such is not the case.\nCreativity and any\nobstacles to it that exist or are put in its path are the concern of every person\nin the United States, and apply to every section of society and every field of\nendeavor. The conquest of disease can be seriously delayed, the most promising\ninquires into the nature and control of illness, the rate of new drug discovery\nwhich will enable us to score an ultimate victory over heart disease, cancer, and\nmental illness, are all jeopardized when incentives for research are not given\nample recognition, but instead are objects for demogogic political attack.\nWe have all rather facetiously referred to the disappearance of the buggy-\nwhip manufacturers, but how many of us realize that the flight engineering craft,\nwhich promised such a roseate future to hundreds of thousands of people, has\nhad a life span of but fifteen years - from the coming in of the multi-engine\npropeller plane to its replacement by the jet. That in another year only two\n\nCreate or Perish\nof our great plane makers will be making planes and that the nation has just\nabout decided to sit out the next round - supersonic carriers.\nVexing unemployment will become more and more a civic problem as whole\ncommunities and even states are dealt broadside blows by the increasing tempo\nof skill obsolescence. The answer is not as one government spokesman has said\nthat the American craftsman should not seek permanence in residence and the\nschooling of his children but should be prepared to migrate like the birds to\nwherever new work opportunities peculiar to his skills arise - but that industry,\ngovernment, finance, and the people themselves should go all out to reinvigorate\nthe creative gift that from the varied nature of our people and our environment\nis our birthright and for nearly two centuries was the identifying mark of our\ngenius.\nCertainly it will call for an overhaul of our educational processes, a reassess\nment of many facets of our technology, and a recognition on the part of the\nscientific community that \"the statesmanship of science requires that science be\nconcerned with more than science.\" But nothing less will do, for time is running\nout.\nDuring the ninety momentous days of the Cuban crisis, we heard a great deal\nabout \"military options\" and there were said to be arguments in the highest\nquarters that the Cuban missile threat was a diversion and that the real Soviet\ngoal was the seizure of Berlin.\nLet there be no argument of misconception about Soviet basic aims. The\narmed threat of total thermonuclear war is the diversion - the Soviet goal is to\ntake over the world by economic and industrial domination.\nHere there are no options. For America and the free world there is only one\ncourse of action -\nCREATE OR PERISH\n\nIndex\nA T & T, 78-80, 97\nAcademy of Applied Science, 40, 102,\n113, 118, 133\nAir Brake, 33, 106\nAirplane, 129\nAlexander Graham Bell, viii, 43-47, 49,\n50, 52-54, 57-60, 95, 105, 130\nAlexander McLean Nicolson, 74, 75, 77-\n79, 81\nAmerican Bar Association, 103\nAmerican Bell Telephone Company, 47-\n49, 60\nAmerican Fruit Growers, 26\nAmerican Institute of Electrical Engi\nneers, 96\nAmerican Speaking and Telephone Com\npany, 48\nAmerican Telephone and Telegraph Com-\nBell Telephone Cases, viii, 22, 24, 43,\n49, 50\nBenvenuto Cellini, 59, 60, 87, 90, 105\nBessemer Process, 132\nBoard of Appeals, 12-15, 27, 78, 91,\nBoard of Patent Interferences, 13\nBourseul, 54, 60\nBritish Patent Office, 3\nBrogdex Company, 26\nBureau of Standards, 64, 65\nCady v.

'\nPORTABLE APPARATUS FOR\nSITTING\nBACKGROUND OF TIm INVENTION\n1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to an\napparatus for supporting a' human in a\nsitting position, and more' particularly to an\napparatus that is portable and stable.\n2. Background of Related Art\nAs known in the prior art, a person\nwalking around their environment and\nfrom place to place can become tired and\nwant to rest. One way to rest is to lie on\nthe ground. However, in many ar~as the\nground is dirty and people usually want to\nrest without becoming dirty.\nIn some\nareas, rocks, logs and stumps are abundant\nand people have found that placing their\nbuttnck on these rocks, logs and stumps\nallows them to rest without lying on the\nground and becoming dirty. People using\nthis resting technique often say that they\n\"sit\" on the rocks, logs or stumps, or are\n\"sitting,\" and the position when their\nbuttock is on the rock, log or stump is\nknown as a sitting position. In some areas '\nthere are very few rocks, logs and stumps\nand so hrimans find it difficult to sit. This\ncan be' a particular problem in areas with\nhomes, where the rocks, logs and stumps\nare useil to construct the home, and are no\nlonger available for sitting.\nEven in areas where rocks, logs\nand stumps are plentiful, they may not be\nconcentrated in the locations where people\nwant to sit, such as 'when they gather\ntogether as a group around a fire and tell\nstories.\nWhat is needed is an apparatus that\npeople can use for sitting in all areas, such\nas areas with few rocks, logs and stumps.\nWhat is also needed is an apparatus that is\nportable so people can easily carry or\n,\nmove the apparatus from place to place,\nallowing them to sit with others in groups.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIn one embodiment, the invention\nprovides an apparatus that includes a\nsubstantially planar surface or seat with a\nfirst and a, second surface, and at least\nthree elongate members or legs.\nThe\nmembers or legs each have a first end and\na second end. The first ends are connected\nto the first surface of the planar surface\nand are oriented with respect to the planar\nsurface such that the legs are substantially\nperpendicular to the planar surface and are\nsubstantially parallel to each other. The\nlength of the legs is approximately equal to\nthe distance between the knee and the\nankle of an adult leg. The plaaar surface is\napproximately equal in area to the area of\nthe back surface of an adult buttock.\nIn one embodiment, the apparatus\nincludes three elongate members or legs.\nIn one embodiment, the apparatus\nincludes foor elongate members or legs.\nIn one embodiment, the apparatus\n, includes'a support member or back that is\nattached to the second surface of the planar\nsurface or seat.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe foregoing features and other\naspects of the invention are explained in\nthe following description taken in\nconjunction with the accompanying\nfigures wherein:\nFIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment\nof the invention with three elongate\nmembers, or legs attached to a planar\n.surface or seat;\nFIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment '\nof the invention with four elongate\nmembers or legs attached to a planar.\nsurface or seat; and\nI\nI\nSample Patent, page 4\ni\nI\n\nUS 6,543,210 BI\nFIG. 3 illustrates one empodiment\nof the invention with a support member or\nback attached to a planar surface or seat.\nlt. is understood that the drawings\nare for illustration only 'and are not\nlimiting.\nDETAllJlD DESCRIPTION OF TIm\nDRAWlNGS\nReferring first to FIG. 1, one\nembodiment of apparatus 100 of the\ninvention includes a planar surface or\n\"seae' 1 02. Planar surface or seat 102 is\npreferably formed of wood, and in some\nembodiments planar surface or seat 102 is\nround, rectangular or square.\nElongate members or \"legs\" 104\nof apparatus 100 have two ends, with one\nend connected to planar surface 1 02. In\nthe embodiment that is illustrated in FIG.\nI, apparatus I 00 has three elongate\nmembers 104. In the embodiment that is\nillustrated in FIG. 2, apparatus '100 has\nfour elongate members 104.\nAlthough not illustrated in the\nfigures, in' one embodiment, elongate\nmembers 104 are first formed as separate\npieces and then they are joined to planar\nsurface 102.\nIn another embodiment,\nelongate members 104 and planar surface\n102 are all formed together.\nIn one\nembodiment, when elongate members 104\nand planar surface 102 are formed as\nseparate pieces and then joined, the\nconnection between elongate members 104\nand planar surface 102 is generally rigid\nand semi-permanent, such as with glue. In\nanother embodiment elongate members\n, 104 are generally rigid and easily\nconnected and removed from planar\nsurface 102, such as by threading.\nThe physical relationship between\nelongate members, 104 and planar surface\n102 is such that elongate members 104 are\nI\ngenerally parallel to each other and also\nperpendicular to planar surface 102. This\nconfiguration 'is illustrated in FIGs. I and\nI\n2. It is possible that elongate members\n104 are not generally parallel to each\nother. However, when elongate members\nare strongly divergent (i.e., form a wide\nangle) the configuration has less strength\nand may result in breakage of elongate\nmembers 104.\nAs illustrated in FIGs. I and 2,\napparatus 100 includes at least three\nelongate members. When fewer than three\nelongate members were tried, it was found\nthat apparatus 100 was not particularly\nstable and resting was therefore difficult.\nWith three elongate members, as\nillustrated in FIG. I, apparatus 100 is very\nstable and it has been found that as long as\nthe length of the elongate members is\ngenerally the same, slight rufferences in\n, length do not matter. With four elongate\nmembers, as illustrated in FIG. 2,\napparatus' 100 is even more stable,\n,although it has been found that a\nsubstantially 'uniform length of elongate\nmembers 104 is important.\nTherefore,\nthere are relative advantages and\ndisadvantages for each of the three \"leg\"\nand four \"leg\" embodiments illustrated in\nFIGs. I and 2 respectively.\nReferring now to FIG. 3, another\nembodiment of apparatus 100 includes a\nsupport member 106., In this embodiment,\nsupport 'member 106 is connected to the\nside of planar surface 102 that is opposite\nthe side of planar surface 102 where\nelongate members 104 are connected. It\nhas been found that by configuring support\nmember 106 so that it extends in a\ngenerally opposite direction from\nt:)1e\nelongate members, a person, can place or\nlean their back against the support member\n'\nwhile resting.\nThis has been shown to\nsignificantly enhance the resting and\nsitting experience. For this reason, support\nmember 106 is also termed a \"back\".\nFor ease of description herein, the\nI\nembodiment with only legs (FIGs. 1 and 2)\nis called a stool, and the embodiment with\nI\nlegs and a back (FIG. 3) is called a chair.\nIn normal sitting use, apparatus\n100 is oriented as illustrated in FIGs. 1 and\nSample Patent, page 5\n\n\" ,\n.US 6,543,210 BI\n2, with the elongate members below planar\nsurface 102.\nIn this configuration, the\n·ends of elongate members 104 that are\nfurthest from planar surface 102 contact\nthe ground. This elevates planar surface\n102 above the ground, and also positions\nplanar surface 102 in a generally\nhorirontal or parallel orientation to the\nground.\nIn .order for apparatus 100 to be\nmost effective when used for sitting, there\nare certain preferred sizes or dimensions\nfor planar surface 102 and elongate\nmembers 104. In one embodiment, the\narea of planar surface or seat 102 is\ngenerally about the same area as the area\nof an adult buttock. In one embodiment,\nthe length of elongate members 104 is\ngenerally about the same as the distance\nfrom the knee tu the ankle of the leg of an\nadult. This is one of the reasons for using\nthe term \"leg\" to apply to elongate\nmembers 104. Of course, if apparatus 100\nis constructed for use by children, the\nlength of leg 104 may be somewhat\nshorter. The same considerations apply for\ntbe area of planar surface 102.\nAlthough illustrative embodiments\nhave been described herein in detail, it\nshould be noted and will be appreciated by\nthose skilled in the art that numerous\nvariations may be made within the scope·\nof this invention without departing from\nthe principle of this invention and without\nsaCrificing its chief advantages.\nUnless otherwise specifically\nstated, the terms and expressions have\nbeen used herein as terms of description\nand not terms of limitation.

Argued October 14, 198()-.Decided March 3, 1981\nDIAMOND v. DIEHR\nOpinion of the Court\nJusTICE REHNQUIST deliVered the opinion of the Court.\nWe granted certiorari to determine whether a process for\ncuring synthetic rubber which includes in several of its steps\nthe use of a mathematical formula and a programmed digital\ncomputer is patentable subject matter under 35 U. S. C. § 101.\nI\nThe patent application at issue was filed by the respondents\non August 6, 1975. The claimed invention is a process for\nmolding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision\nproducts. The process uses a mold for precisely shaping the\nuncured material under heat and pressure and then curing\nthe synthetic rubber in the mold so that the product will\nretain its shape and be functionally operative after the mold\ning is completed.'\nRespondents claim that their process ensures the produc\ntion of molded articles which are properly cured. Achieving\nthe perfect cure depends upon several factors including the\nthickness of the article to be molded, the temperature of the\nmolding process; and the amount of time that the article is\nallowed to remain in the press. It is possible using well\nknown time, temperature, and cure relationships to calculate\nby means of the Arrhenius equation - when to open the press\nLaw Association, Inc.; by Morton a. Jacobs for Applied Data Research,\nInc.; by William L. Mathi8 and Harold D. Messner for Chevron Research\nCo.; and by Reed a. Lawlor and James W. Geriak for the Los Angeles\nPatent Law Association.\n1 A \"cure\" is obtained by mixing curing agents into the uncured polymer\nin advance of molding, and then applying heat over a period of time. If\nthe synthetic rubber is cured for the right length of time at the right\ntemperature, it becomes a usable product.\n2 The equation is named after its discoverer Svante Arrhenius and has\nlong been used to calculate the cure time in rubber-molding presses. The\nequation can be expressed as follows:\nIn v=CZ+x\nwherein ln v is the natural logarithm of v, the total required cure time;\n\nOCTOBER TERM, 1980\nOpinion of -the Court\n450 U.S.\nand remove the cured product. Nonetheless, according to the\nrespondents, the industry has not been able to obtain uni\nformly accurate cures because the temperature of the molding\npress could not be precisely measured, thus making it difficult\n. to do the necessary computations to determine cure time.'\nBecause the temperature inside the press has heretofore been\nviewed as an uncontrollable variable, the conventional indus\ntry practice has been to calculate the cure time as the shortest\ntime in which all parts of the product will definitely be\ncured, assuming a reasonable amount of mold-opening time\nduring loading and unloading. But the shortcoming of this\npractice is that operating with an uncontrollable variable\ninevitably led in some instances to overestimating the mold\nopening time and overcuring the rubber, and in other in\nstances to underestimating that time and undercuring the\nproduct!\nRespondents characterize their contribution to the art to\nreside in the process of constantly measuring the actual tem\nperature inside the mold. These temperature measurements\nare then automatically fed into a computer which repeatedly\nrecalculates the cure time by use of the Arrhenius equation.\nC is the activation constant, a unique figure for each batch of each com\npound being molded, determined in accordance with rheometer -measure\nments of each batch; Z is the temperature in the mold; and x is a con\nstant dependent on the geometry of the particular mold in the press. A\nrheo~eter is an instrument to measure flow of viscous substances.\n8 During the time a press is open for loading, it will cool. The longer it\nis open, the cooler it becomes and the longer it takes to reheat the press\nto the desired temperature range. Thus, the time necessary to raise the\nmold temperature to curing temperature is an unpredictable variable. The\nrespondents claim to have overcome this problem by continuously measur\ning the actual temperature in the closed press through the use of a\nthermocouple.\n\"We note that the petitioner does not seriously contest the respond\nents' assertions regarding the inability of the industry to obtain accurate\ncures on a uniform baBis. See Brief for Petitioner 3.\nDIAMOND v. DIEHR\nOpinion of the Court\nWhen the recalculated time equals the actual time that has\nelapsed since the press was closed, the computer signals a\ndevice to open the press. According to the respondents, the\ncontinuous measuring of the temperature inside the mold\ncavity, the feeding of this information to a digital computer\nwhich constantly recalculates the cure time, and the signaling\nby the computer to open the press, are all new in the art.\nThe patent examiner rejected the respondents' claims on\nthe sole ground that they were drawn to nonstatutory subject\nmatter under 35 U.

C. § 101 which\nprovides:\n''Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful\nprocess, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,\nor any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain\na patent therefor, subject to the conditions and require\nments of this title.\" 0\n0 The word \"process\" is defined in 35 U.S. C. § 100 (b):\n11The term (process' means process, art or method, and includes a new\nuse of a known process, machine, manufacture composition of matter or\n.\n'\n'\nmatena1.\"\n\n----\nOCTOBER TERM, 1980\n450U.S.\nOpinion of the Court\nIn cases of statutory construction, we begin with the lan\nguage of the statute. Unless otherwise defined, \"words will\nbe interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary. com\nmon meaning,\" Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42\n(1979), and, in dealing with the patent laws, we have more\nthan once cautioned that \"courts 'should not read into the\npatent laws limitations and conditions which the legislature\nhas not expressed.' \" Diamond v. Chakrabarty, supra, at 308,\nquoting United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S.\n178, 199 (1933).\nThe Patent Act of 1793 defined statutory subject matter as\n\"any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composi\ntion of matter, or any new or useful improvement [thereof].\"\nAct of Feb. 21, 1793, ch. 11, § 1, 1 Stat. 318. Not until the\npatent laws were recodified in 1952 did Congress replace the\nword \"art\" with the word \"process.\" It is that latter word\nwhich we confront today, and in order to determine its mean\ning we may not be unmindful of the Committee Reports\naccompanying the 1952 Act which inform us that Congress\nintended statutory subject matter to \"include anything under\nthe sun that is made by man.\" S. Rep. No. 1979, 82d Cong.,\n2d Sess., 5 (1952); H. R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong., 2d Sess.,\n6 (1952).\nAlthough the term \"process\" was not added to 35 U. S. C.\n§ 101 until 1952, a process has historically enjoyed patent\nprotection because it was considered a form of \"art\" as that\nterm was used in the 1793 Act.' In defining the nature of a\npatentable process, the Court stated:\n\"That a process may be patentable, irrespective of the\n1 In Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252, 267-268 (1854), this.

DIEHR\nOpinion of the Court\nparticular form of the instrumentalities used, cannot be\ndisputed. . . . A process is a mode of treatment of\ncertain materials to produce a given result. It is an act,\nor a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to\nbe transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\nIf new and useful, it is just as patentable as is a piece\nof machinery. In the language of the patent law, it is\nan art. The machinery pointed out as suitable to per\nform the process may or may not be new or patentable;\nwhilst the process itself may be altogether ·new, and\nproduce an entirely new result. The process requires\nfunction and produce a certain effect or result. But where the result or\neffect is produced by chemical action, by the operation or application of\nsome element or power of nature, or of one substance to another, such\nmodes, methods, or operations, are called processes. A new process is\nusually the result of discovery; a machine, of invention. The arts of tan\nning, dyeing, making water-proof cloth, vulcanizing India rubber, smelting\nores, and numerous others, nrc usually carried on by processes ns dis\ntinguished from machines. One may discover a new and useful improve\n.ment in the process of tanning, dyeing, &c., irrespective of any particular\nform of machinery or mechanical device. And another may invent a\nlnbor-saving machine by which this operation or process may be per\nformed, nnd each may be entitled to his patent.\nAs, for instance, A has\ndiscovered thnt by cxpo.c;ing India rubber to n certain degree of heat, in\nmixture or connection with certain metalic salts, he can produce a valuable\nproduct, or manufacture; he is entitled to a patent for his discovery, as a\nprocess or improvement in the art, irrespective of any machine or mechani\ncal device. B, on the contrary, may invent a new furnace or stove, or\nsteam apparatus, by which this process may be carried on with much\nsaving of laborj and expense of fuel; and he will be entitled to a patent for\nhis machine, as an improvement in the art. Yet A could not have a\npatent for a. machine, or B for a process; but each would have a patent\nfor the means or method of producing ·a certain result, or effect, and not\nfor the result or effect produced. It is for the discovery or invention of\nsome practical method or means of producing a beneficial result or effect,\nthat a patent is granted, and not for the result or effect itself. It is when\nthe term proces:; is used to represent the means or method of producing a\nresult tlmt it is patentable, nnd it will include nil methods or means which\nare not effected by mechanism or mechanical combinations.\"\n\nOCTOBER TERM, 1980\n450U.S.\nOpinion of the Court\nthat certain things should be done with certain sub\nstances and in a certain order; but the tools to be used\nin doing this may be of secondary consequence.\n'\n\" coch\nrane v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780, 787-788 (1877).\nAnalysis of the eligibility of a claim of p~tent protection\nfor a \"process\" did not change with the additiOn of that term\nto § 101. Recently, in Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63\n(1972), we repeated the above definition recited_ in Cochrane\nv. Deener, adding: \"Transformation and reductiOn of an ar\nticle 'to a different state or thing' is the clue to the patent\nability of a process claim that does not include particular\nmachines.\" .409 U. S., at 70.\nAnalyzing respondents' claims according to the above state\nments from our cases, we think that a physical and chemical\nprocess for molding precision synthetic rubber products f_alls\nwithin the § 101 categories of possibly patentable subJect\nmatter. That respondents' claims involve the transforma\ntion of an article, in this case raw, uncured synthetic rubber,\ninto a different state or thing cannot be disputed. The re\nspondents' claims describe in detail a step-by-s~ep method for\naccomplishing such, beginning with the loadmg of a mold\nwith raw, uncured rubber and ending with the eventual ope_n\ning of the press at the conclusion of the cure.\n~ndu~tnal\nprocesses such as this are the types which have histoncally\nbeen eligible to receive the protection of our patent laws.'\ns We note that as early as 1854 this Court approvingly referred to\npatent eligibility of processes for curing rubber. See id., at 267; n. 7'\nsupra. In Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U. S. 707 (1881), we re,;erred ~o. th~\noriginal patent Charles Goodyear received on his process for vulcamzmg\nor curing rubber. We stated:\naThat a patent can be granted for a process, there can be. n~ _doubt.\nThe patent law is not confined to new machines and new compositions of\nmatter, but extends to any new and useful ~rt or n:anufacture.

The\nclaims were drawn to a method for computing an \"alarm\nlimit.\" An \"alarm limit\" is simply a number and the Court\nconcluded that the application sought to protect a formula\nfor computing this number. Using this formula, the updated\nalarm limit could be calculated if several other variables were\nknown.

T. 1980, No. 79-855, p. 6, n. 12, quoting C. Sippi\n& R. Sippi, Computer Dictionary and Handbook 23 (2d ed. 1972).\nThis definition is significantly broader than the definition this Court em\nployed in Benson and Flook.\nOur previous decisions regarding the pat\nentability of \"algorithms\" are necessarily. limited to the more narrow\ndefinition employed by the Court, and we do not pass judgment on whether\nprocesses falling outside the definition previously used by this Court,\nbut within the definition offered by the petitioner, would be patentable\nsubject matter.\n10 As we explnined in Flook, in order for an operator using the formula\nto calculate an updated alarm limit the operator would need to know the\noriginal alarm bnsc, t.he appropriate margin of safrty, the time interval that\nshould elapse between each updating, the current temperature (or other\nprocr;;:s variable), and the appropriate wrighing factor to be us('d to aver\nage the alarm base and the currrnt temperature. 437 U.S., .at 586.\nTl~c\npatent application did not \"explain how to select the ~pprox:Jmate_ margm\nof safety, the weighing factor, or any of the other vanables.\nlbtd.\nDIAMOND v. DIEHR\nOpinion of the Court\ndid it purport \"to contain any disclosure relating to the chemi\ncal processes at work, the monitoring of process variables, or\nthe. means of setting off an alarm or adjusting an alarm sys\ntem. All that it provides is a formula for computing an up\ndated alarm limit.\" 437 U. S., at 586.\nIn contrast, the respondents here do not seek to patent a\nmathematical formula. Instead, they seek patent protection\nfor a process of curing synthetic rubber. Their process ad\nmittedly employs a well-known mathematical equation, but\nthey do not seek to pre-empt the use of that equation.\nRather, they seek only to foreclose from others the usc of that\nequation in conjunction with all of the other steps in their\nclaimed process. These include installing rubber in a press,\nclosing the mold, constantly determining the temperature of\nthe mold, constantly recalculating the appropriate cure time\nthrough the use of the formula and a digital computer, and\nautomatically opening the press at the proper time. Ob\nviously, one does not need a \"computer\" to cure natural or\nsynthetic rubber, but if the computer use incorporated in the\nprocess patent significantly lessens the possibility of \"over\ncuring\" or \"undercuring,\" the process as a whole does not\nthereby become unpatentable subject matter.\nOur earlier opinions lend support to our present conclusion\nthat a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory\ndoes not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a\nmathematical formula, computer program, or digital com\nputer. In Gottschalk v. Benson we noted: \"It is said that\nthe decision precludes a patent for any program servicing\na computer. We do not so hold.\" 409 U. S., at 71.\nSimi\nlarly, in Parker v. Flook we stated that \"a process is not un\npatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a\nmathematical algorithm.\" 437 U. S., at 590. It is now com\nmonplace that an application of a law of nature or mathemat\nical formula to a known structure or process may well be\ndeserving of patent protection. See, e. g., Funk Bros. Seed\n\nOCTOBER TERM, 1980\nOpinion of the Court\n450U.S.\nCo. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127 (1948); Eibel Process\nCo. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co., 261 U. S. 45 (Hl23);\nCochrane v.

As Justice Stone explained four decades ago:\n\"While a scientific truth, or the mathematical expres\nsion of it, is not a patentable invention, a novel and use\nful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scien\ntific truth may be.\" Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.\nv. Radio Corp. of America, 306 U. S. 86, 94 (1939)!'\nWe think this statement in Mackay takes us a long way\ntoward the correct answer in this case.\nArrhenius' equation\nis not patentable in isolation, but when a process for curing\nrubber is devised which incorporates in it a more efficient solu\ntion of the equation, that process is at the very least not\nbarred at the threshold by § 101.\nIn determining the eligibility of respondents' claimed\nprocess for patent protection under § 101, their claims must\nbe considered as a whole. It is inappropriate to dissect the\nclaims into old and new elements and then to ignore the\npresence of the old elements in the analysis. This is par\nticularly true in a process claim because a new combination\nof steps in a process may be patentable even though all the\nconstituents of the combination were well known and in\ncommon use before the combination was made. The \"nov\nelty\" of any element or steps in a process, or even of the\n11 We noted in Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kala Inoculant Co., 333 U.

If there is to be\ninvention from such n. discovery, it must come from the application of the\nlaw of nature to a new and useful end.\"\n.Although we were dealing with a 11product\" claim in Funk Bros., the same\nprinciple applies to a process claim. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63,\n68 (1972).\nDIAMOND v. DIEHR\nOpinion of the Court\nprocess itself, is of no relevance in determining whether the\nsubject matter of a claim falls within the § 101 categories of\npossibly patentable subject matter.\"\nIt has been urged that novelty is an appropriate considera\ntion under § 101. Presumably, this argument results from\nthe language in § 101 referring to any \"new and useful\"\nprocess, machine, etc. Section 101, however, is a general\nstatement of the type of subject matter that is eligible for\npatent protection \"subject to the conditions and requirements\nof this title.\" Specific conditions for patentability follow\nand § 102 covers in detail the conditions relating to novelty.\"\n\"It is argued that the procedure of dissecting a claim into old and new\nelements is mandated by our decision in Flook which noted that a mathe\nmatical algorithm must be assumed to be within the \"prior art.\" It is\nfrom this language that the petitioner premises his argument that if\neverything other than the algorithm is determined to be old in the art,\nthen the claim cannot recite statutory subject matter. The fallacy in this\nargument is that we did not hold in Flook that the mathematical algorithm\ncould not be considered at all when making the § 101 determination. To\naccept the analysis proffered by the petitioner would, if carried to its\nextreme, make all inventions unpatentable because all inventions can be re\nduced to underlying principles of nature which, once known, make their\nimplementation obvious. The analysis suggested by the petitioner Would\nalso undermine our earlier decisions regarding the criteria to consider in\ndetermining the eligibility of a process for patent protection. See, e. g.,\nGottschalk v. Benson, supra; and Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780 (1877).\n\"Section 102 is titled \"Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss\nof right to patent,\" and provides:\n\"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless-\nu(a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or\npatented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country,\nbefore the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, or\n11 (b) the invention was patented or described in a printed pub1ication in\nthis or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more\nthan one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United\nStates, or\n\" (c) he has abandoned the invention, or\nn (d) the invention was first patented or caused to be patented, or was\n\nOCTOBER TERM, 1980\nOpinion of the Court\n450U.S.\nThe question therefore of whether a particular invention is\nnovel is \"wholly apart from whether the invention falls into a\ncategory of statutory subject matter.\" In re Bergy, 596 F.\n2d 952, 961 (CCPA 1979) (emphasis deleted).\nSee also\nNiclwla v. Peterson, 580 F. 2d 898 (CA6 1978). The legisla\ntive history of the HJ52 Patent Act is in accord with this rea\nsoning. The Senate Report stated:\n\"Section 101 sets forth the subject matter that can be\npatented, 'subject to the conditions and requirements of\nthis title.' The conditions under which a patent may be\nobtained follow, and Section 102 covers the conditions\nrelating to novelty.\" S. Rep.

R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 6, 7, and 17\n(1952).\nIn this case, it may later be determined that the respond\nents' process is not deserving of patent protection because it ·\nfails to satisfy the statutory conditions of novelty under § 102\nor nonobviousness under § 103. A rejection on either of these\ngrounds does not affect the determination that respondents'\nclaims recited subject matter which was eligible for patent\nprotection under § 101.\nIV\nWe have before us today only the question of whether re\nspondents' claims fall within the § 101 categories of possibly\npatentable subject matter. We view respondents' claims as\nnothing more than a process for molding rubber products\nand not as an attempt to patent a mathematical formula.\nWe recognize, of course, that when a claim recites a mathe\nmatical formula (or scientific principle or phenomenon of\nnature), an inquiry must be made into whether the claim\nis seeking patent protection for that formula in the abstract.\nA mathematical formula as such is not accorded the protec\ntion of our patent laws, Gottschallc v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63\n(1972), and this principle cannot be circumvented by at\ntempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular techno\nlogical environment. Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584 (1978).\nSimilarly, insignificant postsolution activity will not trans\n\nOCI'OBER TERM, 1980\nOpinion of the Court\n450U. S.\nform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.\nIbid.\" To hold otherwise would allow a competent drafts\nman to evade the recognized limitations on the type of sub\nject matter eligible for patent protection. On the other hand,\n· when a claim containing a mathematical formula implements\nor applies that formula in a structure or process which, when\nconsidered as a whole, is performing a function which the\npatent laws were designed to protect (e. g., transforming or\nreducing an article to a different state or thing), then the\nclaim satisfies the requirements of § 101.\nBecause we do not\nview respondents' claims as an attempt to patent a mathe\nmatical formula, but rather to be drawn to an industrial proc\nu ArguablY, the claims in Flook did more than present a mathematical\nformula. The claims also solved the calrulation in order to produce a new\nnumber or \"alarm limit\" and then replaced the old number with the num\nber newly produced. The claims covered all uses of the formula in proc\nesses \"comprising the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons.\"\nThere are numerous such processes in the petrochemical and oil refinery\nindustries and the claims therefore covered a broad range of potential uses.\n437 U. S., at 580. The claims, however, did not cover every conceivable\napplication of the formula. We rejected in Flook the argument that be\ncause all possible uses of- the mathematical formula were not pre-empted,\nthe claim should be eligible for patent protection.

Much exhaust catalysis devel\nopment has been focused on developing catalytic converters\nfor automotive applications, in which engine speed varies\nsubstantially with vehicle speed and gear selection.\nMarine engines and generators are subjected to specific\nregulations, both for emissions and for safety concerns.

Seawater is injected into 35\nthe method includes controlling the air/fuel ratio with elec\ntronic fuel injection. Some examples also include flowing\ncoolant through a jacket about an exhaust manifold of the\nengine.\nThe details of one or more embodiments of the invention\nare set forth in the accompanying drawings and the descrip\ntion below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the\ninvention will be apparent from the description and draw\nings, and from the claims.\nmany marine engine exhaust flows so as to cool exiting\nexhaust gases, and seawater is also frequently circulated\nDESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\nthrough exhaust system components so as to maintain low\nsurface temperatures.\nFurther improvements in exhaust emissions controls for\nconstant and variable speed engine applications are desired,\nparticularly improvements suitable for marine use.\nFIG. 1 is a perspective view of a marine engine-generator\nset.\nFIG. 2 is a schematic cross-section illustrating flow\nthrough the exhaust manifold and elbow of the engine\ngenerator set of FIG. 1.\nSUMMARY\nFIG. 3 illustrates an alternative second exhaust manifold\nconstruction and catalyst arrangement.\nAccording to one aspect ofthe invention, a marine engine\nincludes an exhaust system having a catalyst cooled by a\nflow of coolant and arranged to intercept a flow of exhaust,\na coolant injector that injects coolant into the flow ofexhaust\nat a point downstream of the catalyst, and a sensor arranged\nto sense a characteristic of the flow of exhaust (such as\noxygen level).

Secured to the outlet of the\nair/fuel ratio at a stoichiometric level, or lightly leaner than\nmanifold 16 is an exhaust elbow 18. In a marine application,\nstoichiometric.\nwater, such as cold seawater, is supplied to manifold 16\n\nUS 7,314,044 B2\nthrough hose 30. The water is directed through cooling\npassages in manifold 16 and elbow 18 to keep the outer\nsurfaces of the exhaust system at or below a desired tem\nperature, and is then injected into the exhaust stream in\nelbow 18, downstream of the catalysts, to cool the exhaust.\nIn one embodiment, a variable is monitored with a feed\nback sensor 19 located upstream of the catalyst which\nprovides a control signal to electronic controller 24. In one\nembodiment, controller 24 provides controls the air fuel\nratio of the engine 12 to correspond to a 1.0 stoichiometric\nratio. In other embodiments, the air fuel ratio of the engine\n12 is slightly lean. In one embodiment, the variable moni\ntored by the feedback sensor is 19 is oxygen and the\nfeedback sensor 19 is a narrow-band oxygen sensor.\nIn one embodiment, an exhaust sensor 23 is mounted\ndownstream ofthe catalyst. In one embodiment, the exhaust\nsensor 23 measures oxygen as a proxy for indirectly deter\nmining the level of carbon monoxide. In this application, a\nwide-band oxygen sensor can be used. In other applications,\nthe exhaust sensor 23 directly measures carbon monoxide.\nThe signal output from the exhaust sensor 23 can provide an\nanticipatory alarm apprising an operator when the catalyst\n32 is functioning with reduced effectiveness. Accordingly,\nthe exhaust sensor can inform the operator if the catalyst 32 25\nhas been damaged by seawater and requires replacement.\nThe exhaust sensor 23 can be a MEMS device in some\nembodiments.\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1 and in an alternative\nembodiment, air is delivered to manifold 16, through a\ncontrollable dump valve 20, from belt-driven air pump 22.\nA fixed speed, electric air pump may also be employed.\nValve 20 is controlled by an electronic controller 24 to\nmoderate the flow ofair into manifold 16 as a function ofthe\nload placed on engine 12, such as by controllably dividing 35\nthe output of the air pump between manifold 16 and exhaust\nelbow 18. Controller 24 varies a signal to valve 20 as a\nfunction of engine load, or as a function of a sensible\nparameter that changes with engine load. In the illustrated\nembodiment, controller 24 senses an output voltage and/or\ncurrent of generator 14, such as at generator output 26, and\ncontrols valve 20 accordingly. Controller 24 also senses\nengine speed, such as by receiving a signal from flywheel\nmagnetic reluctance sensor 28, and controls engine inputs\n(such as fuel and/or air flow) to maintain engine speed at or 45\nnear a desired set point, so as to maintain the frequency of\ngenerator 14. As an alternative to controlling a dump valve\n20 splitting pump air flow between manifold 16 and either\natmosphere or a lower point in the exhaust stream, a variable\nspeed electric air pump 22a is employed in some instances,\nwith controller 24 varying the operating speed of pump 22a\nas a function of engine load. In such cases, the entire output\nof pump 22a is perfectly ported directly to manifold 16.\nReferring to now FIG. 2, a cylindrical catalyst 32 con\ntaining a catalyst bed is shown disposed within the exhaust 55\nmanifold 16. The catalyst 32 is wrapped in an insulating\nblanket 96, such as a Ij8 inch (3.2 millimeter) thick sheet of\ncotton binding containing mica, for example, that helps\nreduce heat transfer from the catalyst into the housing and\nalso helps to isolate the delicate catalyst bed from shocks\nand vibrations. In one embodiment, controlled air flow is\ninjected either just forward of the catalyst at port 38a, or at\nthe far end of the manifold at port 38b so as to preheat the\ninjected air flow. Single catalyst 32 may be of any preferred\ncomposition, such as a palladium-platinum catalyst, for 65\nexample. In other embodiments, no air flow injection is\nrequired.\nWith continued reference to FIG. 2 and in one embodi\nment, catalyst 32 is configured and dimensioned for fitting\nwithin a marine exhaust manifold 16. In one presently\npreferred embodiment, the catalyst 32 has a diameter of3.66\ninch (9.30 cm) and a length of 6.0 inch (15.24 cm). The\ncatalyst 32 can include a round ceramic having a diameter of\n3.0 inch (7.62 cm) and a length of 6.0 inch (15.24 cm) and\na 400-cells per inch with 95-grams per cubic foot ofa 3-to-l\nratio of platinum to rhodium. The catalyst 32 can also\ninclude a specialized wash coat designed to be the most\neffective at a 1.0 stoichiometric air fuel ratio. The catalyst 32\nis configured to simultaneously reduce oxides of nitrogen,\ncarbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. In one preferred\nembodiment, the catalyst 32 is configured to reduce carbon\nmonoxides levels to below 50 part per million, preferably to\nbelow 35 parts per million, and most preferably to below\nambient levels, i.e., 9 part per million.\nOther catalyst configurations are contemplated within the\nexhaust manifold 16. For example as illustrated in FIG. 3,\nthe catalyst 32 in an alternative embodiment can include a\nfirst catalyst 33 an second catalyst 36 contained within a\nsecond bore of the manifold, parallel to and offset from the\nfirst bore. The manifold can be equipped with a removable\ncover 44 through which the air is injected, enabling loading\nof both of the catalysts into their respective bores. As in the\nfirst illustrated embodiment, after flowing through both\ncatalyst beds the exhaust flow is combined with cooling\nwater in elbow 18a.\nThe exhaust is combined and directed through a first\ncatalyst bed 33, through a space 34, and then through a\nsecond catalyst bed 36. The air is injected into the manifold\nin space 34, through air inlet 38. Cooling water flows around\nboth catalyst beds, through appropriate channels cast into\nmanifold 16a and elbow 18, and is then injected into the\nexhaust flow. In marine applications where the cooling\nseawater can have a high salt content, the water injection\noutlets 40 in elbow 18 are preferably at least about six inches\n(15 centimeters) below the lowest edge ofthe catalysts or the\nupper edge of any internal elbow bafiles 42 positioned to\navoid salt water splash on the hot catalysts. Also, it is\npreferred that for such marine applications manifold 16a and\nelbow 18 be cast ofa corrosion-resistant material, such as an\naluminum-magnesium alloy. It will be apparent from FIG. 2\nthat the connection between manifold 16a and elbow 18 can\nbe readily positioned between the two catalyst beds, such\nthat second catalyst 36 is carried within elbow 18.\nThe construction of the catalyst 32 according to this\nembodiment can include a first catalyst bed 33 which\npreferably includes a catalyst such as one containing\nrhodium as the precious metal, selected to reduce hydrocar\nbon and NOx emissions. For example, one preferred catalyst\nbed is in the form of a cylinder 3.0 inches (76 millimeters)\nin diameter and 2.6 inches (6.7 centimeters) long. The\nceramic substrate has a cross-sectional area of about 7\nsquare inches (45 square centimeters) and has about 400\ncells per square inch (62 per square centimeter), and is\nwashed with 6.1 grams per cubic foot (0.06 grams per cubic\ncentimeter) ofrhodium. Such a catalyst bed is available from\nASEC/Delphi Exhaust and Engine Management of Flint,\nMich. Catalysis effIciency within first catalysis bed 33 may\nbe accomplished by various methods known in the art, either\nin carbureted or fuel-injection systems with oxygen sensors,\nto remove as much of the overall emissions components as\npossible.\nThe second catalyst bed 36 contains a catalyst selected to\nfurther reduce CO emissions. In one arrangement, second\ncatalyst bed 36 contains a three to one ratio ofpalladium and\n\nUS 7,314,044 B2\nplatinum, carried on a honey -combed substrate ofceramic or\nmetal. The active precious metals are washed onto the\nsubstrate and then heated to set the metals onto the surface\nas known in the art. An example of a preferred second\ncatalyst bed is a metal substrate in the form of a cylinder of\n5.0 inch (12.7 centimeter) diameter and 6.3 inch (16 centi\nmeter) length, with 19.6 square inches (126 square centi\nmeters) of cross-sectional area, washed with 40 grams per\ncubic foot (004 grams per cubic centimeter) each of palla\ndium and platinum. Such a catalyst is available from Mirat\nech of Tulsa, Okla., for example. Second catalyst 36 will\ntend to run hotter, such as perhaps about 400 degrees\nFahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius) hotter than the rhodium\ncatalyst. Preferably, the temperature of the combined air and\nexhaust entering the second catalyst is about 1000 degrees 15\nFahrenheit (540 degrees Celsius).\nFIGS. 4 and 5 show another example ofa catalyst exhaust\nmanifold 16b. The catalyst 32 is loaded as a cylinder from\nthe large end of the manifold, with the NOx catalyst loaded\ninto bore 46 (FIG. 5) and the CO catalyst loaded into bore\n48 (FIG. 5). In this example, coolant enters the manifold at\ninlet 50 and leaves the manifold at outlet 52, without joining\nthe exhaust stream. The cooling channels 54 cast into the\nmanifold are partially shown in FIG. 5, providing a closed\nflow path between inlet 50 and outlet 52.\nVarious control techniques may be employed to vary air\ninjection rate for good CO reduction. In one embodiment,\nthe air injection rate is varied as a function of approximate\nengine load. In one test using a Westerbeke 4-cylinder, 1.5\nliter gasoline engine and the palladium-platinum second\ncatalyst bed described above, the lowest CO emissions were\nprovided by varying the rate of air flow into the manifold\nahead of the second catalyst (at 100 liter per minute gradu\nations) according to the following table:\nEngine Load (Percent Full Load)\nAir Flow Rate (liters per minute)\nOf course, optimal air flow rates will be different for\ndifferent applications. The air flow controller can be con\nfigured to interpolate between adjacent entries in the load-air\ncorrelation table to provide finer control sensitivity.\nThere are various ways to detennine approximate engine\nload, such that a table like that shown above can be used to\ndetermine an optimal air injection rate. For example, if\nsubstantially all of the engine load is provided by an\nelectrical generator (as shown in FIG. 1), monitoring the\nelectrical output of the generator can provide a good esti\nmate of engine load. Current can be monitored as a most\ndirect measure ofelectrical load, such as providing a current\ntransfonner about the output of the generator. In some cases\nin which generator voltage is known to predictably decrease\na measurable amount with load, voltage may alternately be\nmonitored. In most cases, however, current monitoring is\npreferred for systems with proper generator voltage regula\ntion. Other options include measuring engine output drive\nshaft torque (or some measurable parameter that varies\npredictably with torque), or measuring the pressure within 65\nthe manifold, such as upstream of the catalyst beds, or\nexhaust backpressure below the catalysts and above a muf\nfler or other exhaust restriction. Because the engine speed is\nsubstantially fixed in the primary embodiments, other\nparameters may also be found to vary predictably with\nengine load, such as throttle position and fuel flow rate, for\nexample.\nAs an alternative to controlling the air injection rate as a\nfunction of load, the air injection rate can be controlled as a\nfunction of other measured parameters that signify catalysis\nefficiency. For example, a CO sensor may be provided\ndownstream of the catalyst as described above.\nWith renewed reference to FIG. 2 an in one embodiment,\nan exhaust pressure sensor 62 can be placed in the manifold\n16, to measure exhaust manifold pressure, or downstream of\nthe catalyst 32 to measure exhaust backpressure developed\nupstream of a muffler or other exhaust restriction (not\nshown). If the air pump delivering air to inlet 38 is not a\nfixed displacement pump, changes in exhaust backpressure\nwith engine load can cause a significant fluctuation in the\ninjected air rate. This fluctuation will tend to work against\nthe desired variation of air flow rate with engine load, as\nbackpressure, which rises with engine load, will cause a\nreduction in air injection rate that should be accounted for in\nthe control of the pump or valve. It will be understood that\nsensors 62 are shown in optional and alternative locations,\nand are not necessary in some embodiments, such as when\nair flow rate is controlled as a function of generator current\nor some other primary control parameter.\nReferring now to FIG. 6, an exhaust system 60 for the\nengine 12 monnted in a boat 67 is shown. The exhaust\nmanifold 16 directs exhaust gases through the catalyst 32\nand exhaust elbow 18 and past a water injected exhaust\nelbow 65. To reduce the operating temperature of the\nexhaust components, cooling seawater is injected at the inlet\nto the exhaust elbow 70. The exhaust gases and cooling\nwater then pass through an exhaust valve and water level\nindicator 75 (discussed in more detail below). The exhaust\ngasses and cooling water enter a water lift marine muffler 80\nbefore proceeding to a high point at the V-bend 85 and out\nof the boat through the through-hull fitting 90 above the\nwater line 97. In one embodiment, the muffler 80 includes a\ndrain 95.\nIn marine applications, it is desirable to prevent cooling\nseawater from contacting the catalyst 32 disposed within the\nexhaust manifold 16. It is also desirable to prevent cooling\nseawater from reaching the engine 12, which can results in\ncatastrophic failure. Referring to FIG. 7, an exhaust valve\nand water level indicator 75 are shown and disposed within\nthe marine exhaust manifold 16 between the water injected\nexhaust elbow 65 and the water lift muffler 80 (FIG. 6). The\nvalve/indicator 75 can include a float valve 105, such as a\nball valve and a water level indicator 110 combined in a\nhousing 116. The ball valve 105 translates along the housing\n115 between ball valve guides 120a, 120b and is supported\nby ball valve supports BOa, BOb when the ball valve is\ndisposed in an open position 135 (shown in phantom). When\nthe ball valve 105 ascends upward to the closed position (as\nshown) the surface ofthe ball valve 105 contacts the housing\n115 along valve sealing areas 140a, 140b thereby closing the\nvalve.

He has been a program\nannotator for the Chicago Symphony Or\nchestra and the New Orleans Symphony\nOrchestra and has authored works about\nmusical theory.\nPrior to this case, how\never, he had never made a comparative\nanalysis of two popular songs. Dr. Par\nSons testified on the basis of several charts\nthe Bee Gees and others.\n'comparing the musical notes of each song\nIn addition to, their own testimony at\ntrial, the Bee Gees presented testimony by\ntheir manager, Dick Ashby, and two musi\n':ci~ns, Albhy Galuten and Blue, Weaver,\n'wh~ were on the Bee Gees' staff at the\n'time \"How Deep Is Your Love\" was com\nposed. These witnesses described in detail\nhow, in January 1977, the Bee Gees and\nseveral members of their staff went to a\nrecording studio in the Chateau d'Herou\nville about 25 miles northwest of Paris.\nThere the gi-oup composed at least six new\nsongs and mixed a live album.\nBarry\nGibb's testimony included a detailed expla\nnation of a work tape which was introduced\niI]to evidence and played in court.

Although the tape\ndoes not seem to preserve the very begin\nning of the process of creation, it does\ndepict the process by which ideas, notes,\nlyrics and hits of the tune were gradually\nput together.\nFollowing completion of this work tape, a\ndemo tape was made.\nThe work tape,\ndemo tape, and a vocal-piano verSion taken\nfrom the demo tape are all in the key of E\nflat.\nLead sheet music, 'dated March 6,\n1977, is in the key of E.

Since y:.\naffirm the district court's grant of a judg\nment notwithstanding the verdict, it is not\nnecessary to consider either the grant ~f\nthe motion, in the aiternath-e, for a new\ntrial or the defendants' cross-appeal on the\ndistrict court's denial of summary judg\nment_ We note, however, that the cross\nappeal with respect to the summary judg\nment motion is inappropriate and redun\ndant since the issues it raised were incorpo\nrated in the motion for judgment notwith\nstanding. the verdict.\nThe cross-appeal\nmay be little more than a de\"ice to win an\nopportunity to file the last brief or to argue\nthe evidence of witnesses not presented at\ntrial who furnished· summary judgment af\nfidavits-and is a.'procedure not to be en\ncouraged_\nIII\nSelle's primary contention On this appeal\nis that the district court misunderstood the\ntheory of proof of copyright infringement\non which 'he based his claim.

Copyright Law Sym\nposium, Number 92, American Society of\nComposers, Authors and Publishers 81-82:'\nCo!umbiaUniversity Press (1977) [Iierein:\n\nSELLE v. GIBB\nCUe as 741 F.2d 896 (1984)\nafter \"Sherman, Musical Copyright In\nfringement \"). The only element which is\nat issue iu this appeal is proof of copying;\nthe first two elements are essentially con\nceded, while the fourth (substantial similar\nity) is, at ·least in these circumstances,\nclosely related to the third element under\nplaintiff's theory of the case.\n[6-10] Proof of copying is crucial to\n'any claim of copyright infringement be\ncause no matter how similar the two works\nmay be (even to the point of identity), if the\ndefendant did not copy the accused work,\nthere is no infringement. Arnstein Y. Ed\nward B. Marks Music Corp., 82 F.2d 275\n(2d Cir.), motion ·to set aside decree de\nnied, 86 F.2d 715 (2d Cir.1936).. However,\nbecause direct evidence of copying is rarely\navailable, the plaintiff can rely upon cir·\ncumstantial evidence to prove this essential\nelement, and the most important compo\nnent of this sort of circumstantial evidence\nis proof of access. See generally 3 Nim\nmer, Copyright § 13.02 at 13-9 (1983)\n[hereinafter \"Nimmer, Copyright \"J. The\nplaintiff may be able to introduce direct\nevidence of access when, for example, the\nwork was sent directly to the defendant\n(whether a musician or a publishing compa\nny) or a close associate of the defendant.\nOn the other hand, the plaintiff may be\nable to establish a reasonable possibility of\naC<less when, for example, the complaining\nwork has been widely· disseminated to the\npublic. See, e.g., Abkco Mus-ie, Inc. Y. Har\nrisangs Music, Ltd., 722 F.2d 988, 998 (2d\nCir.1983) (finding of access based on wide\ndissemination); Sherman, Musical .Copy\nright infringement, at 82.\n[11] If, however, the plaintiff does not\nhave direct evidence of access, then an\ninference of. access may still be established\ncircumstantially by proof of . similarity\nwhich is so striking that the possibilities of\nindependent creation, coincidence and prior\ncommon source are1 as a practical matter,\nprecluded. If the plaintiff presents evi\ndence of striking similarity sufficient to\nraise ari inference of access, then copying\nis presumably proved simultaneously, al·\nthough the fourth element (substantial sim\nilarity) still requires proof that the defend\nant copied a substantial amount of the com·\nplaining work. The theory which SelJe at·\ntempts to apply to this case is based on\nproof of copying by circumstantial proof of\naccess established by striking similarity be\ntween the two works.\nOne difficulty with plaintiffs theory is\nthat no matter how great the similarity\nbetween the two works, it is not their simi\nlarity per se which establishes. access;\nrather, their similarity tends to prove ac·\ncess in light of the nature of the works, tile\nparticular musical genre involved and other\ncircumstantial evidence of access. In other\nwords, striking similarity is just one piece\nof circumstantial evidence tending to show\naccess and must not be considered in isola\ntion; it must be considered together with\nother types of circumstantial evidence re\nlating to access.\n. [12] As a threshold matter, therefore, it\nwould appear that there must be at least\nsome other evidence which would establish\na reasonable possibility that the complain\ning work was available to the alleged in\nfringer. As noted, two works may be iden·\ntical in every detail, but, if the alleged\ninfringer created the accused work inde\npendently or both works were copied from\na common source in the public domain, then\nthere is no infringement. Therefore, if the\nplaintiff admits to having kept his or her\ncreation under lock and key, it would seem\nlogically impossible to infer access through\nstriking similarity. Thus, although it has\nfrequently been written tbat striking simi\nlarity alone can estsblish access, the .decid\ned cases suggest that this circumstance\nwonld be most unusual. The plaintiff must\nalways· present sufficient evidence to .suP\nport a reasonable possibility of access be\ncause the jury·cannot draw an inference of\naccess based upon speculation and conjec\nture alone.\n.For example, in Twentieth Century-Fox\nFilm Corp. v. Dieckhaus, 153 F.2d 893 (8th\nCir.), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 716, 67 S.Ct. 46,\n91 L.Ed. 621 (1946), the court reversed a\nfinding of infringement bas~d solely on the\nsimilarities between plaintiff's book and de\n\n,41 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES\nfendant's film. The court stated that the\nplaintiff herself presented no evidence that\nthe defendant had had access to her book,\nand the only people to whom the plaintiff\nhad given a copy of her book testified that\nthey had not given it to the defendant.\nWhile the court also concluded that the\nsimilarities between the book and the film\nwere not that significant, the result turned\non the fact that \"[tlhe oral and documenta·\nry evidence in the record ... establishes\nthe fact that the defendant had no access\nto plaintiff's book unless the law of plagia·\nrism permits the court to draw an inference\ncontrary to such proof from its finding of\nsimilarities on comparison of the book with\nthe pictnre.\" Id. at 897. Thus, although\nproof of striking similarit)\" may permit an\ninference of access, the plaintiff must still\n·meet some minimum threshold of proof\nwhich demonstrates that the inference of\naccess is reasonable.\nThe greatest difficulty perhaps arises\nwhen .the .plaintiff cannot demonstrate any\ndirect link between the complaining work\nand the defendant but the work has been\nso widely disseminated that it is not unrea·\nsonable to infer that the defendant might\nhave had access to it. in Cholvin v. B. &\nF. Music Co., 253 F.2d 102 (7th Cir.1958),\nthe plaintiffs'work had been distributed in\n2000 professional copies of sheet music and\n. four recordings, of which 200,000 records\nwere sold, and it had been performed on\nseveral nationwide broadcasts. The. court\nheld that, in light of this circumstantial\nevidence, it was reasonable to infer, in com·\nbination with similarities between the two\npieces, that there had. been an infringe-\nment: In AbkcQ Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs\nMusic, Ltd., 722 F.2d 988, 997-99 (2d Cir.\n1983); the court found that there had been\na copyright infringement based on a theory\nof subconscious copying. The complaining\nwork; \"He's So Fine,\" had been the most\npopular song in the United States for five\nweeks and among the thirty top hits in\nEngland for seven weeks during the year\nin which George Harrison composed \"My\nSweet Lord,\" the infringing song. This·\nevidence, '~n addition, to Harrisl?n's oV(n ad.\nmission that the two songs were \"striking·\nIy similar,\" supported the finding of in.\nfringement. On the other hand, in Jewel\nMusic Publishing Co. v. Leo Fe;s t, Inc., 62\nF.Supp. 596, 598 (S.D.N.Y.1945), almost 10,\n000 copies of the complaining song had\nbeen distributed or sold and the music had\nalso been broadcast on national perform·\nances. The court still concluded that the\nshowing of access was insufficient, in com.\nbination with the other evidence, to support\na reasonable inference of access.\nThe possibility of access in the present\ncase is not as remote as that in Dieckhaus\nbecause neither side elicited testimony\nfrom the individuals (primarily employees\nof the publishing companies) to whom the\nplaintiff had distributed copies of his song.\nSuch· evidence might have conclusively dis·\nproved access. \"On th\" other hand, Selle's\nsong certainly aid not achieve the extent of\npublic dissemination existing in Cholvin,\nJewel Music Publishing Co., or Ham·\nsongs Music, and there was also no evi·\ndence that any of the defendants or their\nassociates were in Chicago on the two or\nthree occasions when the plaintiff playecj\nhis song publicly. It is not necessary for\nus, given the facts of this case, to deter·\nmine the number of copies wbich must be\npublicly distnouted to raise a reasonable\ninference of access. Nevertheless, in this\ncase; the availability of Selle's song, as\nshown by the evidence, was virtnally de\nminimis. .\n[i3]· In granting the defendants' motiOli\nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict;\nJudge Leighton relied- Jiriman1y on the_\nplaintiffs failure to adduce any evidence of ..,\naccess and stated that an inference· of ae'\ncess may not be based on mere conjecture,\nspeeulation or a bare possibility of access.\n567- F.Supp. at 118L Thus, in Testa' 11-...\nJanssen, 492 F.Supp. 198, 202-03 (W.D.Pa;\n1980), the court stated that \"[t]o support i<.\nfinding of access, plaintiffs' evidence must\n. extend beyond mere speculation or conjec\nture. And, while circumstantial evidence is'\nsufficient to -establish access, a defendant's\nopportunity to view the copyrighted work\nmust exist by a reasonable possibility-not\na bare possibility\" (citation omitted). ~ See·\n\nSELLE v.

The extensive testimony· of the de\nfendants and their witnesses describing the\ncreation process went essentially uncontra·\ndicted, and there was no attempt even to\nimpeach their credibility. Judge Leighton\nfurther relied on the principle that the tes·\ntimony of credible witnesses toncerning·a\nmatter within their knowledge cannot be\nrejected without some impeachment, con·\ntradiction or inconsistency with other evi·\ndence on the particular point at issue.

      "content": "FEIST PUBLICATIONS, INC. v. RURAL TELEPHONE SERVICE CO., INC.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n499 U.S. 340\nMarch 27, 1991\nJUDGES: O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and White, Marshall, Stevens, Scalia,\nKennedy, and Souter, II., joined. Blackmun, J., concurred in the judgment.\nThis case requires us to clarify the extent of copyright protection available to telephone directory white pages.\nI\nRural Telephone Service Company, Inc., is a certified public utility that provides telephone serviceto several communities in\nnorthwest Kansas. It is subject to a state regulation that requires all telephone companies operating in Kansas to issue ann1}aUy\nan updated telephone directory. Accordingly, as a condition of its monopoly franchise, Rural publishes a typical telep}wne\ndirectory, consisting of white pages and yellow pages. The white pages list in alphabetical order the names of Rnra:fs\nsubscribers, together with their towns and telephone numbers. The yellow pages .list Rural's business subscribers alphabetically\nby category and feature classified\nadvertisements of various sizes. Rural distributes its directory free of charge to its\nsubscribers, but earns revenue by selling yellow pages advertisements .\n.fI.eistPulJ.!ic~tiQl}s,Il1c., is':LPt1obh.sh;ing.co.mpany that spe.Giali.'zes. in l!rea-wide tekphone directories. Unlike a_typical\ndirectory, which covers only a particular calling area, Feist's area-wide directories cover a much larger geographical range,\nreducing the need to ca11 directory assistance or consult multiple directories. The Feist directory that is the subject of this\nlitigation covers 11 different telephone service areas in 15 counties and contains 46,878 white pages listings -- compared to\nRural's approximately 7,700 listings. Like Rural's directory, Feist's is distributed free of charge and includes both white pages\nand yellow pages. Feist and Rural compete vigorously for yellow pages advertising.\nAs the sole provider of telephone service in its service area, Rural obtains subscriber information quite easily. Persons desiring\ntelephone service must apply to Rural and provide their names and addresses; Rural then assigns them a telephone number.\nFeist is not a telephone company, let alone one with monopoly\nstatus, and therefore lacks independent access to any\nsubscriber information. To obtain white pages listings for its area-wide directory, Feist approached each of the 11 telephone\ncompanies operating in northwest Kansas and offered to pay for the right to use its white pages listings.\nOf the 11 telephone companies, only Rural refused to license its listings to Feist. Rural's refusal created a problem for Feist, as\nomitting these listings would have left a gaping hole in its area-wide directory, rendering it less attractive to potential yellow\npages advertisers. In a decision subsequent to that which we review here, the District Court determined that this was precisely\nthe reason Rural refused to license its listings. The refusal was motivated by an unlawful purpose \"to extend its monopoly in\ntelephone service to a monopoly in yellow pages advertising.\" Rural Telephone Service Co. v. Feist Publications, Inc., 737\nF. Supp. 610, 622 (Kan. 1990).\n.\nUnable to license Rural's white pages listings, Feist used them without Rural's consent. Feist began by removing several\nthousand listings that fell outside the geographic range of its area-wide directory,\nthen hired personnel to investigate the\n4,935 that remained. These employees verified\nthe data reported by Rural and sought to obtain additional information.\nAs a result, a typical Feist listing includes the individual's street address; most of Rural's listings do not. Notwithstanding these\nadditions, however,\n1,309 of the 46,878 listings in Feist's 1983 directory were identical to listings in Rural's\n1982-1983 white pages. App. 54 (P 15-16), 57. Four of these were fictitious listings that Rural had inserted into its directory\nto detect copying.\nRural sued for copyright infringement in the District Court for the District of Kansas taking the position that Feist, in compiling\nits own directory, could not use the information contained in Rural's white pages. Rural asserted that Feist's employees were\nobliged to travel door-to-door or conduct a telephone survey to discover the same information for themselves. Feist\nresponded that such efforts were economically impractical and, in any event, unnecessary because the information copied was\nbeyond the scope of copyright protection. The District Court granted summary judgment to Rural, explaining that \"courts\nhave consistently held that telephone directories are copyrightable\" and citing a string of lower court decisions. 663\nF. Supp. 214, 218 (1987). In an unpublished opinion; the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed \"for substantially the\nreasons given by the district court.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a,judgt. order reported at 916 F. 2d 718 (1990). We granted\ncertiorari, 498 U.s. 808 (1990), to determine whether the copyright in Rural's directory protects the'nanies, towns, and\ntelephone numbers copied by Feist.\n\nII\nA\nThis case concerns the interaction of two well-established propositions. The first is that facts are not copyrightable; the other,\nthat compilations of facts generally ar~. Each of these propositions possesses an impeccable pedigree. That there can be no\nvalid copyright in facts is universally understood. The most fundamental axiom of copyright law is that\n\"no author may\ncopyright his ideas or the facts he narrates,\" Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 556\n(1985).\nRural wisely concedes this point, noting in its brief that \"facts and discoveries, of course, are not themselves\nsubject to copyright protection.\" Brief for Respondent 24. At the same time, however, it is beyond dispute that compilations of\nfacts are within the subject matter of copyright. Compilations were expressly mentioned in the Copyright Act of 1909, and\nagain in the Copyright Act of 1976.\nThere is an undeniable tension between these two propositions. Many compilations consist of nothing but raw data ~- i. e.,\nwholly factual information not accompanied by any original written expression. On what basis may one claim a copyright in such\na work? Common sense tells us that 100 uncopyrightable facts do not magically change their status when gathered together in\none place. Yet copyright law seems to contemplate that compilations that consist exclusively of facts are potentially within its\nscope.\nThe key to resolving the tension lies in understanding why facts are not copyrightable. The sine qua non of copyright\nis originality. To qualify for copyright protection, a work must be original to the author. See Harper &Row, supra, at\n547-549. Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as\nopposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity. 1 M. Nimmer & D.\nNimmer, Copyright §§_2~01, _-C1990}_Chereinafter_Nimmer)._To_be_sure,_.the requisite level of creativity-is extremely-low;\neven a slight amount will suffice. The vast majority of works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark,\n\"no matter how crude, humble or obvious\" it might be. Id., § 1.08. Originality does not signify novelty; a work may be\noriginal even though it closely resembles other works so long as the similarity is fortuitous, not the result of copying. To\nillustrate,\nassume that two poets, each ignorant of the other, compose identical poems. Neither work is\nnovel, yet both are original and, hence, copyrightable. See Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 81 F. 2d\n49,54 (CA21936).\nOriginality is a constitutional requirement. The source of Congress' power to enact copyright laws is Article I, § 8, cL 8, of the\nConstitution, which authorizes Congress to \"secure for limited Times to Authors ... the exclusive Right to their respective\nWritings.\" In two decisions from the late 19th century -- The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82 (1879); and Burrow-Giles\nLithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.S. 53 (1884) -- this Court defined the crucial terms \"authors\" and \"writings.\" In so doing,\nthe Court made it unmistakably clear that these terms presuppose a degree of originality.\nIn The Trade-Mark Cases, the Court addressed the constitutional scope of \"writings.\" For a particular work to be classified\n\"under the head of writings of authors,\" the Court determined, \"originality is required.\" 100 U.S., at 94. The Court explained\nthat originality requires independent\ncreation plus a modicum of creativity: \"While the word writings may be liberally\nconstrued, as it has been, to include original designs for engraving, prints, &c., it is only such as are original, and are founded\nin the creative powers 'of the mind. The writings which are to be protected are the fruits of intellectual labor, embodied in tl1e\nfonn of books, prints, engravings, and the like.\" Ibid. (emphasis in original).\nIn Burrow-Giles, the Court distilled the same requirement from the Constitution's use of the word \"authors.\" The Court defined\n\"author,\" in a constitutional sense, to mean \"he to whom anything owes its origin; originator; maker.\" III U.S., at 58 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). As in The Trade-Mark Cases, the Court emphasized the creative component of originality. It\ndescribed copyright as being limited to \"original intellectual conceptions of the author,\" 111 U.S., at 58, and stressed the\nimportance of requiring an author who accuses another of infringement to prove \"the existence of those facts of\noriginality, of intellectual production, of thought, and conception.\" Id., at 59-60.\nThe originality requirement articulated in The Trade-Mark Cases and Burrow-Giles remains the touchstone of copyright\nprotection today. See Goldstein v. California, 412 U.S. 546, 561-562 (1973). It is the very \"premise of copyright law.\"\nMiller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 650 F. 2d 1365, 1368 (CA5 1981). Leading scholars agree on this point. As one pair\nof commentators succinctly puts it: \"The originality requirement is constitutionally mandated for all works.\" Patterson &\nJoyce, Monopolizing the Law: The Scope of Copyright Protection for Law Reports and Statutory Compilations, 36 UCLA L.\nRev. 719, 763, n. 155 (1989) (emphasis in original) (hereinafter Patterson & Joyce). Accord, id., at 759-760, and n. 140;\nNimmer § 1.06 (\"Originality is a statutory as well as a constitutional requirement\"); id., § 1.08 (\" modicum of\nintellectual labor ... clearly constitutes an essential constitutional, element\").\nIt is this bedrock principle of copyeight that mandates the law's seemingly disparate treatment of facts and factual\ncompilations. \"No one may claim originality as to facts.\" Id., § 2.11, p. 2-157. This is because facts do not owe their origin\nto an act of authorship. The distinction is one between creation and discovery: The first person to find and report a particular\n\nfact has not created the fact; he or she has merely discovered its existence. To borrow from Burrow-Giles, one who discovers\na fact is not its \"maker\" or \"originator.\" III U.S., at 58. \"The discoverer merely finds and records.\" Nimmer § 2.03. Census\ntakers, for example, do not \"create\" the population figures that emerge from their efforts; in a sense, they copy these figures\nfrom the world around them. Denicola, Copyright in Collections of Facts: A Theory for the Protection of Nonfiction\nLiterary Works, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 516, 525 (1981) (hereinafter Denicola). Census data therefore do not trigger copyright\nbecause these data are not \"original\" in the constitutional sense. Nimmer\n§ 2.03. The same is true of a11 facts -\nscientific, historical,\nbiographical, and news of the day. \"They may not be copyrighted and are part of the public\ndomain available to every person.\" Miller, supra, at 1369.\nFactual compilations, on the other hand, may possess the requisite originality. The compilation author typically chooses which\nfacts to include, in what order to place them, and how to arrange the collected data so that they may be used effectively by\nreaders. These choices as to selection and arrangement, so long as they are made independently by the compiler and entail a\nminimal degree of creativity, are sufficiently original that Congress may protect such compilations through the copyright laws.\nNimmer §§ 2.11, 3.03; Denicola 523, n. 38. Thus, even a directory that contains absolutely no protectible written\nexpression, only facts, meets the constitutional minimum for copyright protection if it features an original selection or\narrangement. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 547. Accord, Nimmer § 3.03.\nThis protection is subject to an important limitation. The mere fact that a work is copyrighted does not mean that every element\nof the work may be protected. Originality remains the sine qua non of copyright; accordingly, copyright protection may extend\nonly to those components of a work that are original to the author. Patterson & Joyce 800-802; Ginsburg, Creation and\nCommercial Value: Copyright Protection of Works ofInformation, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1865, 1868, and n. 12 (1990)\n(hereinafter Ginsburg). Thus, if the compilation author clothes facts with an original collocation of words, he or she may be able\nto claim a copyright in this written expression. Others may copy the underlying facts from the publication, but not the precise\nwords used to present them. In Harper & Row, for example, we explained that President Ford could not prevent others from\n_copyingbare.historical£acts from his autobiography, see 471 U.S.,.at556,55.7, bULthathe .could prevent-others from copying\nhis \"subjective descriptions and portraits of public figures.\"\nId., at 563. Where the compilation author adds\nno written expression but rather lets the facts speak for themselves, the expressive element is more elusive. The only\nconceivable expression is the manner in which the compiler has selected and arranged the facts. Thus, if the selection and\narrangement are original, these elements of the work are eligible for copyright protection. See Patry, Copyright in Compilations\nof Facts (or Why the \"White Pages\" Are Not Copyrightable), 12 Com. & Law 37, 64 (Dec. 1990) (hereinafter Patry). No\nmatter how original the format, however, the facts themselves do not become original through'association. See Patterson &\nJoyce 776.\nThis inevitably means that the copyright in a factual compilation is thin. Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent\ncompiler remains free to use the facts contained in another's publication to aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the\ncompeting work does not feature the same selection and arrangement. As one commentator explains it: \"No matter how much\noriginal authorship the work displays, the facts and ideas it exposes\nare free for the taking .... The very same facts\nand ideas may be divorced from the context imposed by the author, and restated or reshuffled by second comers, even if the\nauthor was the first to discover the facts or to propose the ideas.\" Ginsburg 1868.\nIt may seem unfair that much of the fruit of the compiler's labor may be used by others without compensation. As Justice\nBrennan\nhas correctly observed, however, this is not\"some unforeseen byproduct of a statutory scheme.\" Harper\n& Row, 471 U.S., at 589 (dissenting opinion). It is, rather, \"the essence of copyright,\" ibid., and a constitutional requirement.\nThe primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but \"to promote the Progress of Science and useful\nArts.\" Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Accord, Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156 (1975). To this end, copyright\nassures authors the right to their original\nexpression, but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and\ninfonnation conveyed by a work. Harper & Row, supra, at 556-557. This principle, known as the idea/expression\nor facUexpression dichotomy, applies to all works of authorship. As applied to a factual compilation, assuming the absence of\noriginal written expression, only the compiler's selection and arrangement may be protected; the raw facts may be copied at\nwill. This result is neither unfair nor unfortunate. It is the means by which copyright advances the progress of science and art.\nThis Court has long recognized that the fact/expression dichotomy limits severely the scope of protection in fact-based works.\nMore than a century ago, the Court observed: \"The very object of publishing a book on science or the useful arts is to\ncommunicate to the world the useful knowledge which it contains. But this object would be frustrated if the knowledge could\nnot be used without incuning the guilt of piracy of the book.\" Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 103 (1880). We reiterated this\npoint in Harper & Row:\n\"No author may copyright facts or ideas. The copyright is limited to those aspects of the work -- termed\n'expression' -- that\ndisplay the stamp of the author's originality.\n\"Copyright does not prevent subsequent users from copying from a prior author's work those constituent elements\nthat are not original -- for example ... facts, or materials in the public domain -- as long as such use does not\nunfairly appropriate the author's original contributions.\" 471 U.S., at 547-548 (citation omitted).\n\nThis, then, resolves the doctrinal tension: Copyright treats facts and factual compilations in a wholly consistent manner. Facts,\nwhether alone or as part of a compilation, are not original and therefore may not be copyrighted. A factual compilation is\neligible for copyright if it features an original selection or arrangement of facts, but the copyright is limited to\nthe particular selection or arrangement. In no event may copyright extend to the facts themselves.\nB\nAs we have explained, originality is a constitutionally mandated prerequisite for copyright protection. The Court's decisions\nannouncing this rule predate the Copyright Act of 1909, but ambiguous language in the 1909 Act caused some lower courts\ntemporarily to lose sight of this requirement.\nThe 1909 Act embodied the originality requirement, but not as clearly as it might have. See Nimmer § 2.01. The subject matter\nof copyright was set out in §§ 3 and 4 of the Act. Section 4 stated that copyright was available to \"all the writings of an author.\"\n35 Stat. 1076. By using the words \"writings\" and \"author\" -- the same words used in Article I, § 8, of the Constitution and\ndefined by the Court in The Trade-Mark Cases and Burrow-Giles -- the statute necessarily incorporated the originality\nrequirement articulated in the Court's decisions. It did so implicitly, however, thereby leaving room for error.\nSection 3 was similarly ambiguous. It stated that the copyright in a work protected only \"the copyrightable\ncomponent parts of the work.\" It thus stated an important copyright principle, but failed to identify the specific\ncharacteristic -- originality -- that detennined which component parts of a work were copyrightable and which were not.\nMost courts construed the 1909 Act correctly, notwithstanding the less-than-perfect statutory language. They understood from\nthis Court's decisions that there could be no copyright without originality. See Patterson & Joyce 760-761. As explained in the\nNimmer treatise: -\"The-1909 -Act neither defined originality,- nor even-expressly-required--that--a work- be 'original' in-order to\ncommand protection. However, the courts uniformly inferred the requirement from the fact that copyright protection may only\nbe claimed by 'authors' .... It was reasoned that since an author is 'the. .. creator, originator' it follows that a work is\nnot the product of an author unless the work is original.\" Nimmer § 2.01 (footnotes omitted) (citing cases).\nBut some courts misunderstood the statute. See, e. g., Leon v. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co., 91 F. 2d 484 (CA9\n1937); Jeweler's Circular Publishing Co. v. Keystone Publishing Co., 281 F. 83 (CA2 1922).\nThese courts\nignored §§ 3 and 4, focusing their attention instead on § 5 of the Act. Section 5, however, was purely technical in nature: It\nprovided that a person seeking to register a work should indicate on the application the type of work, and it listed 14 categories\nunder which the work might fall. One of these categories was \"books, including composite and cyclopaedic works, directories,\ngazetteers, and other compilations.\" § 5(a). Section 5 did not purport to say that all compilations were automatically\ncopyrightable. Indeed, it expressly disclaimed any such function, pointing out that \"the subject-matter of copyright is defined in\nsection four.\" Nevertheless, the fact that factual compilations were mentioned specifically in § 5 led some courts to infer\nerroneously that directories and the like were copyrightable per se, \"without any further or precise showing of original -\npersonal-- authorship.\" Ginsburg 1895.\nMaking matters worse, these courts developed a new theory to justify the protection of factual compilations. Known\nalternatively as \"sweat of the brow\" or \"industrious collection,\n\" the underlying notion was that copyright was a\nreward for the hard work that went into compiling facts. The classic formulation of the doctrine appeared in Jeweler's Circular\nPublishing Co., 281 F., at 88:\n\"The right to copyright a book upon which one has expended labor in its preparation does not depend upon\nwhether the materials which he has collected consist or not of matters which are publici juris, or whether such\nmaterials show literary skill or originality, either in thought or in language, or anything more than industrious\ncollection. The man who goes through the streets of a town and puts down the names of each of the\ninhabitants, with their occupations and their street number, acquires material of which he is the author\" (emphasis\nadded).\nThe \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine had numerous flaws, the most glaring being that it extended copyright protection in a\ncompilation beyond selection and arrangement -- the compiler's original contributions -- to the facts themselves. Under the\ndoctrine, the only defense to infringement was independent creation. A subsequent compiler was \"riot entitled to take one word\nof information\npreviously published,\" but rather had to \"independently work out the matter for himself, so as to arrive\nat the same result from the same common sources of information.\" Id., at 88-89 (internal quotations omitted). \"Sweat of the\nbrow\" courts thereby eschewed the most fundamental axiom of copyright law -- that no one may copyright facts or ideas. See\nMiller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 650 F. 2d, at 1372 (criticizing \"sweat of the brow\" courts because \"ensuring that later\nwriters obtain the facts independently ... is precisely the scope of protection given ... copyrighted matter, and the law is clear\nthat facts are not entitled to such protection\").\n\nC\nDecisions of this Court applying the 1909 Act make clear that the statute did not permit the \"sweat of the brow\" approach. The\nbest example is International News Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215 (1918). In that decision, the Court stated\nunambiguously that the 1909 Act conferred copyright protection only on those elements of a work that were original to the\nauthor. International News Service had conceded taking news reported by Associated Press\nand publishing it in its\nown newspapers. Recognizing that § 5 of the Act specifically mentioned \"'periodicals, including newspapers,'\" § 5(b), the Court\nacknowledged that news articles were copyrightable. Id., at 234. It flatly rejected, however, the notion that the copyright in an\narticle extended to\nthe factual information it contained: \"The news element -- the information respecting current events\ncontained in the literary production -- is not the creation of the writer, but is a report of matters that ordinarily are publici juris;\nit is the history of the day.\" Ibid. *\nWithout a doubt, the \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine flouted basic copyright principles. Throughout history, copyright law has\n\"recognized a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.\" Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 563.\nAccord, Gorman, Fact or Fancy: The Implications for Copyright, 29 J. Copyright Soc. 560, 563 (1982). But \"sweat\nof the brow\" courts took a contrary view; they handed out proprietary interests in facts and declared that authors are absolutely\nprecluded from saving time and effort by relying upon the facts contained in prior works. In truth, \"it is just such wasted effort\nthat the proscription against the copyright of ideas and facts ... designed to prevent.\" Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v.\nRandom House, Inc., 366 F. 2d 303, 310 (CA2 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1009 (1967). \"Protection for the fruits of such\nresearch ... may in certain circumstances be available under a theory of unfair competition. But to accord copyright protection\non this basis alone distorts basic copyright principles in that it creates a monopoly in public domain materials without the\nnecessary justification of protecting and encouraging the creation of 'writings' by 'authors.'\" Nimmer § 3.04, p. 3-23 (footnote\nomitted).\n\"Sweat-of the_brow\"_ decisions_did_notescape_ the_attention oUhe_Copyright Office~ When.congress decided_ to overhaul the\ncopyright statute and asked the Copyright Office to study existing problems, see Mills Music, Inc. v. Snyder, 469\nU.S. 153, 159 (1985), the Copyright Office promptly recommended\nthat Congress clear up the confusion in the lower\ncourts as to the basic standards of copyrightability. The Register of Copyrights explained in his first report to Congress that\n\"originality\" was a \"basic requisite\" of copyright under the 1909 Act, but that \"the absence of any reference to [originality] in the\nstatute seems to have led to misconceptions as to what is copyrightable matter.\" Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 9 (H. Judiciary Comm. Print 1961). The Register\nsuggested making the originality requirement explicit. Ibid.\nCongress took the Register's advice. In enacting the Copyright Act of 1976, Congress dropped the reference to \"all the\nwritings of an author\" and replaced it with the phrase \"original works of authorship.\" 17 U. S. C. § 102(a). In making explicit\nthe originality requirement, Congress announced that it was merely clarifying existing law: \"The two fundamental\ncriteria of copyright protection\noriginality and fixation in tangible form .... The phrase 'original works of\nauthorship,' which is purposely left undefined, is intended to incorporate without change the standard of originality\nestablished by the courts under the present copyright statute.\" H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 51 (1976) (emphasis\nadded) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.); S. Rep. No. 94-473, p. 50 (1975) (emphasis added) (hereinafter S. Rep.). This sentiment\nwas echoed by the Copyright Office: \"Our intention here is to maintain the established standards of originality....\"\nSupplementary Report of the Register of Copyrights on the General Revision of U.S. Copyright Law, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.,\npt. 6, p. 3 (H. Judiciary Comm. Print 1965) (emphasis added).\nTo ensure that the mistakes of the \"sweat of the brow\" courts would not be repeated, Congress took additional measures. For\nexample, § 3 of the 1909 Act had stated that copyright protected only the \"copyrightable component parts\" of a work, but had\nnot identified originality as the basis for distinguishing\nthose component parts that were copyrightable from\nthose that were not. The 1976 Act deleted this section and replaced it with § 102(b), which identifies specifically those\nelements of a work for which copyright is not available: \"In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship\nextend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form\nin which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\" Section 102(b) is universally understood to prohibit\nany copyright in facts. Harper & Row, supra, at 547, 556. Accord, Nimmer § 2.03 (equating facts with \"discoveries\"). As\nwith § 102(a), Congress emphasized that § 102(b) did not change the law, but merely clarified it: \"Section 102(b) in no way\nenlarges or contracts the scope of copyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to restate ... that the basic\ndichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.\" H. R. Rep., at 57; S. Rep., at 54.\nCongress took another step to minimize confusion by deleting the specific mention of \"directories ... and other compilations\" in\n§ 5 of the 1909 Act. As mentioned, this section had led some courts to conclude that directories were copyrightable per se and\nthat every element of a directory was protected. In its place, Congress enacted two new provisions. First, to make clear that\ncompilations were not copyrigl;1table per se, Congress provided a definition of the term \"compilation.\" Second, to make clear\nthat the copyright in a cOI?pilation did not extend to the facts themselves, Congress enacted § 103.\n* The Court ultimately rendered judgment for Associated Press on non-copyright grounds that are not relevant here. See 248\nU.S., at 235, 241-242.\n\nThe definition of \"compilation\" is found in § 101 of the 1976 Act. It defines a \"compil.ation\" in the copyright sense as \"a work\nformed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such\na way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work\nof authorship\" (emphasis added).\nThe purpose of the statutory definition is to emphasize that collections of facts are not copyrightable per se. It conveys\nthis message through its tripartite structure, as emphasized above by the italics. The statute identifies three distinct elements and\nrequires each to be met for a work to qualify as a copyrightable compilation: (1) the collection and assembly of pre-existing\nmaterial, facts, or data; (2) the selection, coordination, or arrangement of those materials; and (3) the creation, by virtue of the\nparticular selection, coordination, or arrangement, of an \"original\" work of authorship. \"This tripartite conjunctive structure is\nself-evident, and should be assumed to 'accurately express the legislative purpose.'\" Patry 51, quoting Mills Music, 469 U.S.,\nat 164.\nAt first glance, the first requirement does not seem to tell us much. It merely describes what one normally thinks of as a\ncompilation -- a collection of pre-existing material, facts, or data. What makes it significant is that it is not the sale\nrequirement. It is not enough for copyright purposes that an author collects and assembles facts. To satisfy the\nstatutory definition, the work must get over two additional hurdles. In this way, the plain language indicates that not every\ncollection of facts receives copyright protection. Otherwise, there would be a period after \"data.\"\nThe third requirement is also illuminating. It emphasizes that a compilation, like any other work, is copyrightable only if it\nsatisfies the originality requirement (\"an original work of authorship\"). Although § 102 states plainly that the originality\nrequirement applies to all works, the point was emphasized with regard to compilations to ensure that courts would not repeat\nthe mistake of the \"sweat of the brow\" courts by concluding that fact-based works are treated differently and measured by\nsome other standard. As Congress explained it, the goal was to \"make plain that the criteria of copyrightable subject matter\nstated in section 102 apply with full force to works ... containing preexisting material.\" H. R. Rep., at 57; S. Rep., at 55.\nThe key to the statutory definition is the second requirement. It instructs courts that, in determining whether a\nfact-based work is an original work of authorship, they should focus on the manner in which the collected facts have been\nselected, coordinated, and arranged. This is a straight-forward application of the originality requirement. Facts are never\noriginal, so the compilation author can claim originality, if at all, only in the way the facts are presented. To that end, the statute\ndictates that the principal focus should be on whether the selection, coordination, and arrangement are sufficiently original to\nmerit protection.\nNot every selection, coordination, or arrangement will pass muster. This is plain from the statute. It states that, to merit\nprotection, the facts must be selected, coordinated, or arranged \"in such a way\" as to render the work as a whole originaL This\nimplies that some \"ways\" will trigger copyright, but that others will not. See Patry 57, and n. 76. Otherwise, the phrase \"in such\na way\" is meaningless and Congress should have defined \"compilation\" simply as \"a work fonned by the collection and\nassembly of preexisting materials or data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged.\" That Congress did not do\nso is\ndispositive. In accordance with \"the established principle that a court should give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of\na statute,\" Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 109-110 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), we conclude that the\nstatute envisions that there will be some fact-based works in which the selection, coordination, and. arrangement are not\nsufficiently original to trigger copyright protection.\nAs discussed earlier, however, the originality requirement is not particularly stringent. A compiler may settle upon a selection or\narrangement that others have used; novelty is not required. Originality requires only that the author make the selection or\narrangement independently 0. e., without copying that selection or arrangement from another work), and that it display some\nminimal level of creativity. Presumably,\nthe vast majority of compilations will pass this test, but not all will. There\nremains a narrow category of works in which\nthe creative spark is utterly lacking or so trivial as to be virtually\nnonexistent. See generally Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239, 251 (1903) (referring to \"the narrowest\nand most obvious limits\"). Such works are incapable of sustaining a valid copyright. Ninuner § 2.01.\nEven if a work qualifies as a copyrightable compilation, it receives only limited -protection. This is the point of § 103 of the Act.\nSection 103 explains that \"the subject matter of copyright ... includes compilations,\" § 103(a), but that copyright\nprotects only the author's original contributions ~- not the facts or information conveyed:\n\"The copyright in a compilation ... extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work, as\ndistinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the\npreexisting material.\" § 103(b).\nAs § 103 makes clear, copyright is not a tool by which a compilation author may keep others from using the facts or data he or\nshe has collected. \"The most important point here is one that is commonly misunderstood today: copyright ... has no effect one\nway or the other on the copyright or public domain status of the preexisting material.\" H. R. Rep., at 57; S. Rep., at 55. The\n1909 Act did not require, as \"sweat of the brow\" courts mistakenly assumed, that each subsequent compiJer must start from\nscratch and is precluded from relying on research undertaken by another. See, e. g., Jeweler's Circular Publishing Co., 281\nF., at 88-89. Rather, the facts contained in existing works m-ay be freely copied because copyright protects only the elements\n\nthat owe their origin to the compiler -- the selection, coordination, and arrangement of facts.\nIn summary, the 1976 revisions to the Copyright Act leave no doubt that originality, not \"sweat of the brow,\" is the\ntouchstone of copyright protection in directories and other fact-based works.\nNor is there any doubt that the same\nwas true under the 1909 Act. The 1976 revisions were a direct response to the Copyright Office's concern that many lower\ncourts had misconstrued this basic principle, and Congress emphasized repeatedly that the purpose of the revisions was to\nclarify, not change, existing law. The revisions explain with painstaking clarity that copyright requires originality, § 102(a); that\nfacts are never original, § 102(b); that the copyright in a compilation does not extend to the facts it contains, § 103(b); and that\na compilation is copyrightable only to the extent that it features an original selection, coordination, or arrangement, § 101.\nThe 1976 revisions have proven largely successful in steering courts in the right direction. A good example is Miller v.\nUniversal City Studios, Inc., 650 F. 2d, at 1369-1370: \"A copyright in a directory _.. is properly viewed as resting on the\noriginality of the selection and arrangement of the factual material, rather than on the industriousness of the efforts to develop the\ninformation. Copyright protection does not extend to the facts themselves, and the mere use of information contained\nin a directory without a substantial copying of the format does not constitute infringement\" (citation omitted). Additionally, the\nSecond Circuit, which almost 70 years ago issued the classic formulation of the \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine in Jeweler's\nCircular Publishing Co., has now fully repudiated the reasoning of that decision. See, e. g., Financial Information, Inc. v.\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc., 808 F. 2d 204, 207 (CA2 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 820 (1987); Financial\nInformation, Inc. v. Moody's Investors Service, Inc., 751 F. 2d 501, 510 (CA2 1984HNewman, 1, concurring); Hoehling\nv. Universal City Studios, Inc., 618 F. 2d 972,979 (CA2 1980). Even those scholars who believe that \"industrious\ncollection\" should be rewarded seem to recognize that this is beyond the scope of existing copyright law. See Denicola 516\n(\"The very vocabulary of copyright is ill suited to analyzing property rights in works of nonfiction\"); id., at 520-521,\n525; Ginsburg 1867, 1870.\nill\nThere is no doubt that Feist took from the white pages of Rural's directory a substantial amount of factual information. At a\nminimum, Feist copied the names,\ntowns, and telephone numbers of 1,309 of Rural's subscribers. Not all copying,\nhowever, is copyright infringement. To establish infringement, two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright,\nand (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 548. The first element\nis not at issue here; Feist appears to concede that Rural's directory, considered as a whole, is subject to a valid copyright\nbecause it contains some foreword text, as well as original material in its yellow pages advertisements. See Brief for Petitioner\n18; Pet. for Cert. 9.\nThe question is whether Rural has proved the second element. In other words, did Feist, by taking 1,309 names, towns, and\ntelephone numbers from Rural's white pages, copy anything that was \"original\" to Rural? Certainly, the raw data does\nnot satisfy the originality requirement. Rural may have been the first to discover and report the names, towns, and telephone\nnumbers of its subscribers, but this data does not \"'owe its origin'\" to Rural. Burrow-Giles, 111 U.S., at 58. Rather, these bits\nof information are uncopyrightable facts; they existed before Rural reported them and would have continued to exist if Rural\nhad never published a telephone directory. The originality requirement \"rules out protecting ... names, addresses, and\ntelephone numbers of which the plaintiff by no stretch of the imagination could be called the author.\" Patterson & Joyce 776.\nRural essentially concedes the point by referring to the names, towns, and telephone numbers as \"preexisting material.\" Brief for\nRespondent 17. Section 103(b) states explicitly that the copyright in a compilation does not extend to \"the preexisting\nmaterial employed in the work.\"\nThe question that remains is whether Rural selected, coordinated, or arranged these uncopyrightable facts in an original way. As\nmentioned, originality is not a stringent standard; it does not r_equire that facts be presented in an innovative or\nsurprising way. It is equally true, however, that the selection and arrangement of facts cannot be so mechanical or routine as to\nrequire no creativity whatsoever. The standard of originality is low, but it does exist.·See Patterson & Joyce 760, n. 144\n(\"While this requirement is sometimes characterized as modest, or a low threshold, it is not without effect\") (internal quotation\nmarks omitted; citations omitted). As this Court has explained, the Constitution mandates some minimal degree of creativity,\nsee The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S., at 94; and an author who claims infringement must prove \"the existence of.\nintellectual production, of thought, and conception.\" Burrow-Giles, supra, at 59-60.\nThe selection, coordination, and arrangement of Rural's white pages do not satisfy the minimum constitutional standards for\ncopyright protection. As mentioned at the outset, Rural's white pages are entirely typicaL Persons desiring telephone service in\nRural's service area fill out an application and Rural issues them a telephone number. In preparing its white pages,\nRural simply takes the data provided by its subscribers and lists it alphabetically by surname. The end product is a\ngarden-variety white pages directory, devoid of even the slightest trace of creativity.\nRural's selection of listings could not be more obvious: It publishes the most basic information -- name, town, and telephone\nnumber -- about each person who applies to it for telephone service. This is \"selection\" of a sort, but it lacks the modicum of\ncreativity necessary to transform mere selection into copyrightable expression. Rural expended sufficient effort\nto\n\nmake the white pages directory useful, but insufficient creativity to make it original.\nWe note in passing that the selection featured in Rural's white pages may also fail the originality requirement for another reason.\nFeist points out that Rural did not truly \"select\" to publish the names and telephone numbers of its subscribers; rather, it was\nrequired to do so by the Kansas Corporation Commission as part of its monopoly franchise. See 737 F. Supp., at\n612. Accordingly, one could plausibly\nconclude that this selection wa~ dictated by state law, not by Rural.\nNor can Rural claim originality in its coordination and arrangement of facts. The white pages do nothing more than list Rural's\nsubscribers in alphabetical order. This arrangement may, technically speaking, owe its origin to Rural; no one disputes that\nRural undertook the task of alphabetizing the names itself. But there is nothing remotely creative about arranging names\nalphabetically in a white pages directory. It is an age-old practice, firmly roote<fin tradition and so commonplace that it has\ncome to be expected as a matter of course. See Brief for Information Industry Association et al. as Amici Curiae 10\n(alphabetical arrangement \"is universally observed in directories published by local exchange telephone companies\"). It is not\nonly unoriginal, it is practically inevitable. This time-honored tradition does not possess the minimal creative spark required by\nthe Copyright Act and the Constitution.\nWe conclude that the names, towns, and telephone numbers copied by Feist were not original to Rural and therefore were not\nprotected by the copyright in Rural's combined white and yellow pages directory. As a constitutional matter, copyright protects\nonly those constituent elements of a work that possess more than a de minimis quantum of creativity. Rural's white pages,\nlimited to basic subscriber information and arranged alphabetically, fall short of the mark. As a statutory matter, 17 U. S. C. §\n101 does not afford protection from copying to a collection of facts that are selected, coordinated, and arranged in a\nway that uttetly lacks originality. Given that some works must fail, we cannot imagine a more likely candidate. Indeed, were we\nto hold that Rural's white pages pass muster, it is hard to believe that any collection of facts could fail.\nI3~qlllse Rllr~rs. wQite pageslaclc the reqllisite 9.dgiIlality, F~ist's lIse ofth,e li~tings capIl()t CO[lstituteinfrillgement..TIlis decision\nshould not be construed as demeaning Rural's efforts in compiling its directory, but rather as making clear that copyright\nrewards originality, not effort.

For the 99 excerpts identified in this filing, the\nexcerpted portions on average represented 9.6% of the pages in the copyrighted books\n(Defendants' calculations). The majority of the excerpts were one chapter of a multichapter\nbook. On average these books contained eighteen chapters. . . .\nOn June 1, 2011, Plaintiffs voluntarily and unilaterally filed with the Clerk of Court a\nrevised list of 75 claimed infringements [Doc. 361]. This list dropped 25 of the claimed\ninfringements from the March 15 joint list and added one new claim. This list also offered\ncertain information concerning the 75 claimed infringements. The remaining 75 claimed\ninfringements are those which were addressed during the trial.\n\n* * *\nIII. Copyright Infringement and the Fair Use Defense\nThe next step is to examine how Georgia State's 2009 Copyright Policy operated in relation\nto the requirements of copyright law during the three 2009 academic terms. This is a\nchallenging process on at least two levels. By far the most fundamental difficulty is the very\nfluid framework for resolving fair use issues which is established by copyright law. To\ndetermine when a particular use is a \"fair use,\" four statutory factors must be considered.\nThese factors are: (1) the purpose and character of the use; (2) the nature of the copyrighted\nwork; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted\nwork as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the\ncopyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107. This does not exclude consideration of other factors.\nHarper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 588, 105 S. Ct. 2218, 85 L.\nEd. 2d 588 (1985). It is hornbook law that there is no across the board rule for what weight\nshould be given to each factor or how the factors should be applied. Campbell v. Acuff-\nRose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 577-78, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994); Harper\n& Row, 471 U.S. at 588. This determination is made after a fact-intensive, value-laden\nreview in each case of claimed infringement. In Campbell, the Supreme Court's last fair use\ndecision, the Court reaffirmed that fair use does not rest on \"bright-line rules\" and must be\ndone on a case-by-case basis. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577 (quoting Harper & Row, 471 U.S.\nat 560). The Supreme Court then added, \"Nor may the four statutory factors be treated in\nisolation, one from another. All are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light\nof the purposes of copyright.\" Id. at 578.\n\nAnother difficulty is that there is no precedent on all fours for how the factors should be\napplied where excerpts of copyrighted works are copied by a nonprofit college or university\nfor a nonprofit educational purpose. Thus, assuming that there is some efficacy in having a\n\"fair use checklist\" that professors must fill out before using a copyrighted excerpt, what\nshould be in it may be open to debate. The Court believes that the best way to proceed is\nfirst to decide how the four fair use factors should be applied in a case such as this one\n(unpaid copying of excerpts of copyrighted material by a nonprofit college or university for\nnonprofit educational use in graduate or upper level college courses). Also, the Court will\nconsider whether any other factor or consideration should be taken into account. This will\nbe based on the facts of record in the instant case. Once this decision is made, each of the 75\nclaimed infringements will be addressed individually. . . .\nA. Findings of Fact\n* * *\nThe Excerpts at Issue in this Case\nAlmost all of the 75 excerpts at issue were assigned as supplemental readings in graduate\nlevel or upper level undergraduate courses. By \"supplemental\" the Court does not\n\nnecessarily mean optional; in many cases the excerpts were required reading. All of the\ncourses were in the social science or language fields. Professors specified on the course\nsyllabus that certain books were required to be purchased; in addition, the students were\ndirected to the listed excerpts which were posted on ERES. The supplemental readings are\nall from books which are properly classified as informational. None are fiction. They all\naddress topics which lend themselves to incorporation into the social science and language\ncourses involved in this case. Most of the books are not textbooks in that they are not\nspecifically intended for student instruction. They all address topics which would be of\ninterest to an educator in the subject area addressed by the book. Some of the books would\nbe of interest both within and beyond the academic community. The edited books are \"in the\nhalfway house between textbooks and monographs\". The single author books tend to be\nsmall books with a narrow, in-depth focus, averaging 366 pages per book.\nThe excerpts are extra readings which supplement the purchased books so as to provide a\nfuller, richer course curriculum at a lesser cost than would be the case if the students had to\nbuy extra books or pay permissions fees for the excerpts.\nSeventy five excerpts from 64 books will be examined in this Order. The excerpts were\nselected by 23 professors for 29 courses in three semesters in 2009. On average these\nexcerpts were 10.1% of the pages in the copyrighted books. Fifty six of the excerpts were\ncomprised of one chapter or less from 54 of the books. On average these books have sixteen\nchapters. Fifteen of the excerpts are two or more chapters of a multichapter book, with the\nratios of chapters used to total chapters being 2/25, 2/9, 2/8, 2/10, 3/12, 2/10, 3/9, 2/15, 4/44,\n7/44, 3/36, 2/36, 2/30, 2/10, 2/15. The remaining four excerpts are from books that are not\ndivided into chapters.\n* * *\nStudents access the digital materials on ERES by going to its website [Tr. Vol. 4 at 112].\nOnce on the ERES website, a student accesses course reading materials by inputting the\npass code obtained from the professor for the course [Tr. Vol. 4 at 112-113]. A student may\nonly access the readings for the courses in which she is enrolled [Tr. Vol. 4 at 112]. The\nstudent must acknowledge and agree to respect the copyrighted nature of the materials. The\nstudent may access a reading as often as desired and is not prohibited from downloading,\nprinting or saving the reading to her hard drive; however, once the semester for which that\nparticular reading was assigned has ended, students can no longer access that reading\nthrough the ERES course page.\n* * *\nThe trial evidence showed that unlicensed copying of excerpts of copyrighted books at\ncolleges and universities is a widespread practice in the United States. As Defendants'\nwitness Dr. Kenneth Crews testified, many schools' copyright policies allow more liberal\nunlicensed copying than does Georgia State's 2009 Copyright Policy.\n\n* * *\nB. Conclusions of Law\n* * *\n\n2. The Fair Use Defense\nDefendants contend that all of Plaintiffs' infringement claims are barred by the doctrine of\nfair use, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 107. Fair use is a defense that may be considered once a\nprima facie case of infringement has been established. Bateman v. Mnemonics, Inc., 79 F.3d\n1532, 1546 n.28 (11th Cir. 1996). 17 U.S.C. § 107 states:\n107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use\nNotwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a\ncopyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or\nphonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes\nsuch as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple\ncopies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of\ncopyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular\ncase is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\n\n(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a\ncommercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the\ncopyrighted work as a whole; and\n(4) the effect of the use upon [*74] the potential market for or value of the\ncopyrighted work.\nDefendants bear the burden of proving that each use was a fair use under the statute. Peter\nLetterese & Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters., Int'l, 533 F.3d 1287, 1307\nn.21 (11th Cir. 2008). The analysis of the fair use defense must be done on a case-by-case\nbasis, Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 561, 105 S. Ct.\n2218, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1985), and \"All [four factors] are to be explored, and the results\nweighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.\" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music,\nInc., 510 U.S. 569, 578, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994); see also Suntrust Bank\nv. Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d 1257, 1268 (11th Cir. 2001).\nThe Supreme Court's most recent and most important fair use opinion is Campbell v. Acuff-\nRose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994). In Campbell, a\n\nrap group created a commercial rap parody of a rock song. The owner of the copyright in the\nsong brought suit, and the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the\nbasis of fair use. The Court of Appeals reversed. In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme\nCourt discussed the four fair use factors and remanded the case due to errors of law as well\nas remaining issues of material fact as to factor four which precluded summary judgment.\nAlthough Campbell was a commercial parody case, its reasoning guides this Court's analysis\nin the instant case.\nFactor 1: Purpose and Character of the Use, including whether such use is of a commercial\ncharacter or is for nonprofit educational purposes\nThe language of § 107 itself and the Supreme Court's opinion in Campbell compel the\ndecision that the first fair use factor favors Defendants. This case involves making copies of\nexcerpts of copyrighted works for teaching students and for scholarship, as specified in the\npreamble of § 107. The use is for strictly nonprofit educational purposes as specified in §\n107(1). The fact that the copying is done by a nonprofit educational institution leaves no\ndoubt on this point.\nTo support their argument that factor one weighs against fair use, Plaintiffs rely heavily on\nBasic Books, Inc. v. Kinko's Graphics Corp., 758 F. Supp. 1522 (S.D.N.Y. 1991); Princeton\nUniversity Press v. Michigan Document Services, Inc., 99 F.3d 1381 (6th Cir. 1996); and\nAmerican Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 919 (2d Cir. 1994). However,\nKinko's and Michigan Document Services involved commercial copiers that produced\nprinted coursepacks and sought unsuccessfully to characterize their use of copyrighted\nmaterials as noncommercial, nonprofit uses. Texaco involved a for-profit corporation\nmaking unpaid copies for purposes of scientific research, which the Second Circuit\ncharacterized as an \"intermediate use.\" Texaco, 60 F.3d at 921. Because Georgia State is a\npurely nonprofit, educational institution and the excerpts at issue were used for purely\nnonprofit, educational purposes, this case is distinguishable from Kinko's, Michigan\nDocument Services, and Texaco.\n* * *\nFactor 2: Nature of the Copyrighted Work\nCopyright protects original works of authorship. 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Copyright protects\nexpression. Palmer v. Braun, 287 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir. 2002). It does not protect ideas. 17\nU.S.C. § 102(b). A work is considered original to the author and qualifies for copyright\nprotection if the work is independently created by the author and possesses some minimal\ndegree of creativity. Feist, 499 U.S. at 345. The vast majority of the books involved here\nmeet the independent creation requirement. The level of creativity required for\ncopyrightability is extremely low and the work satisfies that requirement so long as it\n\"possess[es] some creative spark, 'no matter how crude, humble or obvious it might be.'\nOriginality does not signify novelty . . . .\" Feist, 499 U.S. at 345 (quoting Nimmer on\nCopyright § 1.08[C][1]) (internal citations omitted).\n\nAll of the books at issue in this case meet the creativity standard set by Feist for\ncopyrightability. Defendants do not claim otherwise. The second fair use factor, \"nature of\nthe use,\" requires the Court to look beyond the standard acknowledged in Feist to examine\nthe relative degree of creativity in the works at issue. In Campbell, the Supreme Court\nstated: \"This factor [the second factor] calls for recognition that some works are closer to\nthe core of intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that fair use is\nmore difficult to establish when the former works are copied.\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586. It\nis generally recognized that \"Under [the second] factor, the more creative a work, the more\nprotection it should be accorded from copying; correlatively, the more informational or\nfunctional the plaintiff's work, the broader should be the scope of the fair use defense.\" 4-13\nNimmer on Copyright, § 13.05[A][2][a].\nAs previously stated, none of the books at issue are fictional. All of them are intended to\ninform and educate.\nSome of the books are not merely descriptive; they contain material of an evaluative nature,\ngiving the authors' perspectives and opinions. To the extent that this is a comment about the\nauthor's mode of expression (as opposed to the substance of her perspectives and opinions),\none could argue that this type of work merits a finding of a greater degree of creativity,\ndisfavoring fair use. Countering this argument, however, is that § 107 itself recognizes\n\"criticism and comment\" as deserving of more public exposure, not less and hence works of\nthis nature more likely will be protected by fair use. See 17 U.S.C. § 107. On consideration,\nthe books involved in this case are properly classified as informational in nature, within the\nspectrum of factual materials and hence favoring fair use.\nAnother issue is whether the scholarly nature of some of the works at issue may give them\nmore protection; that is, incline against fair use. In this regard, the Court credits the\ntestimony [*81] of Plaintiffs' witnesses who testified to the tremendous amount of effort\nand expense which goes into creating high quality works of scholarship. Also, the Court\nobserved during the trial that a high quality research effort inevitably involves some amount\nof creativity; the researcher is required to make qualitative judgments in the course of the\nresearch effort. However, upon review of the precedent, the Court concludes that the cost,\neffort, and level of creativity required to produce the work are not relevant to the factor two\nanalysis. In Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 111 S. Ct.\n1282, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1991), the Supreme Court considered and rejected the \"sweat of\nthe brow\" doctrine (that copyright is intended to protect an author's investment in creating\nthe work) as being inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. Feist, 499 U.S. at 359-60.\n* * *\nFactor 3: Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used in Relation to the Copyrighted\nWork as a Whole\nFactor three requires consideration of both the quantity and the value of the amount copied\nin relation to the overall book. The portion used must be reasonable in relation to the work\nfrom which it was taken and the purpose for which it was used. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586.\n\nThe portions taken averaged about ten percent of the original (though some were\nconsiderably more and some were considerably less). The precise purpose for which each\nexcerpt was used varied, but generally the purpose was to enrich and add depth to the course\ncurriculum. Also, the Court must consider whether the amount taken is reasonable given the\nlikelihood of market substitution. Peter Letterese, 533 F.3d at 1314 n.30. The fact that the\nexcerpts were mirror-image copies favors market substitution (thus leaning against fair use),\nbut this tendency is reduced when the excerpt is small. Ultimately a decision as to what\namount of copying is permissible as fair use requires consideration of fair use factor three in\nconjunction with factors one and four.\n* * *\nb. Amount of the Portion Used in Relation to the Copyrighted Work as a Whole\nBefore beginning this analysis, it is appropriate to note that copying a de minimis part of a\ncopyrighted work is not an infringement at all. Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios,\nInc., 464 U.S. 417, 451 n.34, 104 S. Ct. 774, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1984). Therefore, by\ndefinition fair use must look beyond de minimis copying.\nThe number of pages in a book\nFor each claimed infringement, the amount of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted\nbook as a whole is calculated by dividing the number of pages in the copied excerpt by the\nnumber of pages in the book. The parties initially disagree about how many pages are in\neach book. Plaintiffs contend that the calculation should be based on the number of pages\nthat comprise the text of the book, within the chapters. Defendants contend that the page\ncount should also include material such as the table of contents, acknowledgments, the\npreface or foreword, an afterword, and indices. . . . The Court agrees with Defendants that\nthe material appearing before and after the chapter text of the book comprises part of the\nwork as a whole. Material such as dedications and acknowledgments are written expression\nby the author or editor, and introductory remarks included in a foreword or preface are\ncertainly original expression protected by the copyright for the work. In addition, the Court\nbelieves the pages in the index should be counted in the total page count; in most of the\nworks, the index is comprised of whole numbered pages, and the decision on what terms to\ninclude in the index constitutes copyrightable expression. Thus, for the works at issue here,\nthe Court will accept (with some noted exceptions) the Defendants' contention of the\nnumber of pages in each work and will calculate the percent copied based on that page\ncount.\nDetermining what is \"the copyrighted work\"\nTo calculate the percent amount of the work that was copied by Defendants, it is also\nnecessary to first determine what the excerpt will be measured against. In their post-trial\nProposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law filed July 22, 2011 and also in their\nreply brief filed July 30, 2011, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' copying of a whole chapter\nof an edited book amounts to a forbidden 100% taking because each of the chapters has a\n\nseparate author, each addresses a distinct subject and each was originally conceived as a\nseparate work. Therefore, Plaintiffs argue, it does not matter that the particular chapter\ncomprised only a minuscule portion of the overall book, because Defendants copied 100%\nof the chapter in question. To win this argument Plaintiffs must contend that under § 107(3)\nthe chapters are \"the copyrighted works,\" not the books. Plaintiffs take their cue for this\nargument from the Second Circuit's opinion in American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc.,\n60 F.3d 913 (2d Cir. 1994 amended 1995). The Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument because it\nwas raised too late in the proceedings.\n* * *\nWhat amount is small enough?\nHaving determined that the amount taken will be calculated as a percentage of the entire\nbook, the Court will now discuss what percentage of the whole book is a sufficiently small\namount--that is, what amount of copying will shift factor three in favor of either\nDefendants or Plaintiffs.\nCongress intended that use of a smaller portion would be more apt to be acceptable than use\nof a larger portion. Taking into account the fact that this case involves only mirror-image,\nnontransformative uses, the amount used must be decidedly small to qualify as fair use.\nAlso, other factors must be considered in making this determination. Peter Letterese &\nAssocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters., Int'l, 533 F.3d 1287, 1314, n.30 (11th\nCir. 2008).\nTo frame the discussion of this issue, the Court will review the most relevant precedent,\nnoting at the outset that neither case is binding and neither is completely analogous.\nIn Kinko's, the fact that seven of the excerpts were 5% to 14% of the whole \"weigh[ed]\nagainst defendant.\" 758 F. Supp. at 1527-28. The court found that the copying of five other\nexcerpts, ranging from 16% to 28% of the whole \"weigh[ed] heavily against defendant.\" Id.\nThe Sixth Circuit, in Michigan Document Services, also noted the quantity of pages that had\nbeen copied to form the coursepack excerpts. Six different works had been excerpted\nwithout permission. In addressing \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in\nrelation to the copyrighted work as a whole,\" the Court stated: \"'[T]he larger the volume (or\nthe greater the importance) of what is taken, the greater the affront to the interests of the\ncopyright owner and the less likely that a taking will qualify as a fair use.'\" Mich. Document\nServs., 99 F.3d at 1389 (quoting Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 HARV.\nL. REV. 1105, 1122 (1990)). The Court did state that the 95 page, 30% copying was more\ntroubling than the 17 page, 5% copying previously referenced. It nonetheless held that the\ndefendants had failed to carry their burden of proof on fair use factor three with respect to\nall six of the works.\nKinko's and Michigan Document Services are helpful as a beginning point in the factor\nthree analysis in the instant case. However, unlike the instant case, they did not involve\n\nnonprofit educational uses by a nonprofit educational institution. Here, fair use factor one\nstrongly favors Defendants and tends to push the amount of permissible copying toward a\ngreater amount than the under 5% amount which Kinko's and Michigan Document Services\ndid not specifically reject, and into the 5%-14% range which Kinko's found weighed\nagainst, but did not \"weigh heavily against\" fair use. Kinko's, 758 F. Supp. at 1527.\nDefendants presented evidence at trial that numerous colleges and universities have\ncopyright policies which allow more liberal unpaid copying than the 10.1% average uses\nwhich occurred at Georgia State in 2009. This evidence is not entitled to any weight in\ndetermining the permissible extent of fair use. In the absence of judicial precedent\nconcerning the limits of fair use for nonprofit educational uses, colleges and universities\nhave been guessing about the permissible extent of fair use.\nc. Substantiality of the Portion Used in Relation to the Copyrighted Work as a Whole\nThe great majority of the excerpts used in this case were a chapter or less from a multi-\nchapter book. Some of these excerpts came from edited books, in which each chapter is\nwritten by a different author.\nThe word \"substantiality\" as used in § 107(3) means \"value.\" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose\nMusic, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 586, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994) (quoting Folsom\nv. Marsh, 9 F.Cas. 342, 348, F. Cas. No. 4901 (C.C. D. Mass. 1841)). The substantiality test\nunder factor three involves the degree to which the excerpts are qualitatively significant \"in\nrelation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\" 17 U.S.C. § 107. Of the excerpts involved in\nthis case, including excerpts made up of one or more chapters, almost none have notable\nqualitative significance or value \"in relation to the work as a whole.\" That is because the\nsubject matter addressed by the relevant chapters is not a substantively dominant part of the\nbook. Almost none of the chapters which were used from either the single author works or\nthe edited volumes are \"the heart of the book,\" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation\nEnters., 471 U.S. 539, 565, 105 S. Ct. 2218, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1985), or a \"critical part\" of\nthe book, Kinko's, 758 F. Supp. at 1533; almost none bear an unusually striking relationship\nto the book as a whole. The chapters in both the edited books and the single author books\ncover distinct, separately titled subtopics, so that almost none has a dominant relationship to\nthe substance of the work as a whole.\nIn Kinko's, the District Court rejected as unfair the copying of twelve different excerpts. It\nfound that the excerpts met the \"substantiality\" test of factor three because the portions\ncopied were \"critical parts of the books\" which was \"the likely reason the college professors\nused them in their classes.\" Kinko's, 758 F. Supp. at 1533.\nIn Michigan Document Services, the Sixth Circuit, in addition to noting that the amount of\ncopying involved was \"not insubstantial,\" also stated that the substantiality or \"value\" of the\nexcerpted materials in relation to the entire work was shown by the fact that the professors\nhad made them required reading. Mich. Document Servs., 99 F.3d at 1389. The Sixth\nCircuit did consider that fact in determining that the third factor favored plaintiffs.\n\nWhile this Court has no knowledge of whether the excerpts in Kinko's and Michigan\nDocument Services were \"critical parts\" of the books, it disagrees with the suggestion that a\nprofessor's selection of an excerpt means that the excerpt is a critical part of the book. It is\nat least equally likely that the excerpt was selected because it filled a need within the course\ncurriculum. A chapter of an academic book is a unit which, in all likelihood, covers a\nparticular theory or topic, so as to make it suitable for use in a course which covers a\nbroader, related overall subject matter. Because this case does involve strictly educational,\nnonprofit uses, it is relevant that selection of a whole chapter of a book (either from a\ntypical, single author chapter book or from an edited book) likely will serve a more valuable\neducational purpose than an excerpt containing a few isolated paragraphs. Professors want\nstudents to absorb ideas and useful, context-based information. This can be accomplished\nbetter through chapter assignments than through truncated paragraphs. However, the\nselected excerpt must fill a demonstrated, legitimate purpose in the course curriculum and\nmust be narrowly tailored to accomplish that purpose.\n* * *\nMost of the professors who selected the excerpts in this case testified and explained why\nthey selected the particular chapter or other excerpt for the course. The Court finds that all\nof the selections indeed did further the legitimate educational purposes of the course\ncurriculum. Most were narrowly tailored to accomplish that purpose.\nBefore determining what amount of copying is appropriate for fair use on the facts of this\ncase, the Court will evaluate fair use factor four and certain additional considerations\ndiscussed below. The amount allowed to be excerpted will be determined in the overall fair\nuse assessment thereafter.\nIn summary, factor three may favor either Plaintiffs or Defendants, depending on the\namount taken from each book.\nFactor 4: The Effect of the Use on the Potential Market for or Value of the Copyrighted\nWork\nFactor four focuses on whether Defendants' (the professors' and the students') use of\nexcerpts of Plaintiffs' copyrighted works adversely affected the potential market for or value\nof the copyrighted work in question.\nFactor four should weigh against defendant only when the harm is significant, Campbell v.\nAcuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 590, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994);\nhowever, because Defendants have the burden of proof on all elements of the fair use\ndefense, a helpful restatement is: to prevail on factor four, Defendants have the burden of\nproving that any harm from the infringing use is insubstantial. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at\n590; Peter Letterese & Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters., Int'l, 533 F.3d\n1287, 1307 n.21 (11th Cir. 2008). The factor four analysis calls for determination of whether\nDefendants' unpaid uses of the excerpts caused or will cause harm to the \"potential market\nfor or value of the copyrighted work\"; i.e., harm to the marketability of the copyrighted\n\nwork or the value of the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. § 107.\nThe copyrighted works at issue here are books of which the excerpts are parts. In general,\nPlaintiffs have the exclusive right to reproduce the books in whole or in part because they\nown the copyrights, 17 U.S.C. § 106(2)(3) or, by contract, have the exclusive right to\nreproduce all parts of the books. Although copyright protection extends to derivative works,\n17 U.S.C. § 103(a), the excerpts of the copyrighted books are not derivative works. Rather\nthe excerpts are verbatim copies of parts of the copyrighted books.\nThe adverse market effect with which fair use is primarily concerned is that of market\nsubstitution. Peter Letterese, 533 F.3d at 1315. Where the copyrighted original work and\ndefendant's infringing copy are identical, defendant's infringing copy substitutes directly for\nthe copyrighted original. This impacts the marketability of the original and reduces its value,\ncausing harm to the copyright owner. This case involves excerpts from whole original\nworks. In general, the larger the excerpt, the greater the potential harm; a large excerpt\ncomes closer to substituting for the whole book. It is relevant here that the excerpts were\ngenerally a small part (averaging around 10%) of the whole copyrighted work. Such a small\nexcerpt does not substitute for the book as a whole. The Court is required to consider\n\"whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant . . .\nwould result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market [for the original].\"\nCampbell, 510 U.S. 569, 590, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994) (citations omitted);\nsee also Sony, 464 U.S. at 451. Thus, if a professor used an excerpt representing 10% of the\ncopyrighted work, and this was repeated by others many times, would it cause substantial\ndamage to the potential market for the copyrighted work? The answer is no, because the\n10% excerpt would not substitute for the original, no matter how many copies were made.\nIn short, Defendants' use of small excerpts did not affect Plaintiffs' actual or potential sales\nof books.\nPlaintiffs' argument that factor four tilts in their favor is based primarily on American\nGeophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913 (2d Cir. 1994, amended 1995). The Second\nCircuit found that CCC is \"a workable market for institutional users to obtain licenses for\nthe right to produce their own copies of individual articles via photocopying.\" Id. at 930.\nThe court also said, \". . . it is not unsound to conclude that the right to seek payment for a\nparticular use tends to become legally cognizable under the fourth fair use factor when the\nmeans for paying for such use is made easier.\" Id. at 930-31. In Texaco, an employee of\nTexaco had made photocopies of certain articles from a scientific journal to which Texaco\nsubscribed. Other employees of Texaco had made photocopies as well. The Second Circuit\nfound that Texaco should have paid license fees to CCC for the photocopies of the articles.\nIts failure to have done so cost the publisher-plaintiff licensing revenues; hence, \"the\npublishers have demonstrated a substantial harm to the value of their copyrights through\n[Texaco's] copying.\" Id. at 931 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nThis Court agrees with Texaco that where excerpts are reasonably available, at a reasonable\nprice, it is only fair for this fact to be considered in determining whether Defendants' unpaid\nuses of excerpts constitutes a fair use. Fair use is an equitable doctrine. Peter Letterese, 533\nF.3d at 1308. For loss of potential license revenue to cut against fair use, the evidence must\n\nshow that licenses for excerpts of the works at issue are easily accessible, reasonably priced,\nand that they offer excerpts in a format which is reasonably convenient for users. Cf.\nWilliam F. Patry, PATRY ON FAIR USE § 6:8 (2011) (\"easy, inexpensive licensing\"); see\nalso Texaco, 60 F.3d at 931 (\"[I]t is sensible that a particular unauthorized use should be\nconsidered 'more fair' when there is no ready market or means to pay for the use, while such\nan unauthorized use should be considered 'less fair' when there is a ready market or means\nto pay for the use.\").\n* * *\nWith respect to Defendants' uses of excerpts where digital permissions were not shown to be\navailable, the Court finds that the unpaid use of the excerpts caused no actual or potential\ndamaged to the value of the books' copyrights. The evidence in this case shows that\nDefendants' uses (i.e., the professors' and the students' uses) of the materials were under\ncarefully monitored circumstances. A pass code is required for the students in the class to\naccess the materials; at the end of the semester access terminates. This is quite different\nfrom Campbell, where the parodied version of plaintiff's work was publicly performed and\ntherefore made available to a wide audience. It is unlikely that the use of excerpts by\nprofessors and students resulted in the exposure of the copyrighted materials to people other\nthan the class participants. For this additional reason, there is little risk of widespread\nmarket substitution of the Defendants' copy for the Plaintiffs' original.\nIn those cases in which digital permissions were available, the Court finds that Defendants'\nown unpaid uses (the Georgia State professors' and students' uses) of individual excerpts\ncaused extremely small, though actual, damage to the value of the books' copyrights. A\nbook's ability to command payment of permissions fees has a relationship to the value of the\ncopyrighted book, i.e., to the value of the copyright. If available permissions are not paid,\nthe value of the copyright is less than it otherwise would be.\nWere the fair use analysis to end here, Defendants would prevail as to all of Plaintiffs'\ninfringement claims because the uses of the excerpts by students and professors at Georgia\nState did not cause substantial harm to Plaintiffs' copyrights. However, two additional\nconsiderations weigh against Defendants' position. The first is the Supreme Court's holding\nin Campbell that courts must consider not only the harm caused by the defendant's own\nactions, but also what harm would ensue from \"widespread conduct of the sort engaged in\nby the defendant.\" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 590, 114 S. Ct. 1164,\n127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994). Second, fair use is an equitable doctrine. The fair use analysis\nwould be deficient if the Court were not to take into account Plaintiffs' right, as owners of\nthe copyrights, to collect fees for use of excerpts from their books. This is a powerful\nargument countering fair use, which counsels against Defendants' position when excerpts\nare readily available, in a convenient format, for a reasonable fee, and the fees are not paid.\nThis consideration could be treated as a separate fair use factor; the Court includes it as part\nof the factor four analysis because it pertains to nonpayment of permissions fees, the same\nas the rest of the factor four analysis. Taking into account these considerations, factor four\nweighs heavily in Plaintiffs' favor when permissions for digital excerpts are readily\navailable. If excerpts are not readily available as stated, factor four weighs in Defendants'\n\nfavor.\nJudges and scholars have noted that there is a circularity problem in evaluating the extent of\npotential harm or loss of value under the fourth fair use factor. Peter Letterese, 533 F.3d at\n1319 n.37; American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 931 (2d Cir. 1994).\nSpecifically, it is understood that plaintiff will suffer some harm from defendant's use of the\ncopyrighted item when fair use applies. The objective of the fair use analysis is to determine\nwhether fair use applies. To say that fair use does not apply because Defendants have made\nsome unpaid use of the copyrighted item is circular reasoning. There is no ideal solution to\nthis problem. The approach that will be taken in evaluating individual claims of\ninfringement here will be that all fair use factors will be evaluated independently, without\nregard to consideration of circularity. If overall resolution of the fair use issue is close or\ninconclusive, further analysis will be undertaken.\nAdditional Considerations\na. Limited unpaid copying of excerpts will not deter academic authors from creating new\nacademic works.\nThe Constitution itself gives Congress the power \"To promote the Progress of Science and\nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to\ntheir respective Writings and Discoveries.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Therefore, a primary\nconsideration must be whether use of small unpaid excerpts, which will slightly limit the\namount of permissions income paid to authors and external editors of copyrighted books,\nwould discourage authorship of new academic books. Plaintiffs do not make the argument\nthat it would, and the evidence does not support it.\n* * *\nb. The slight limitation of permissions income caused by the fair use authorized by this\nOrder will not appreciably diminish Plaintiffs' ability to publish scholarly works and will\npromote the spread of knowledge.\n* * *\nPlaintiffs first argue that reduction in permissions payments could cripple them financially,\npotentially causing them to cease to exist [Doc. 412 at 113-14]. Alternatively, Plaintiffs\nargue they might be forced to reduce publication of high quality scholarly works [Doc. 412\nat 113-14]. The argument that Plaintiffs might be forced out of business is glib. It is\nunsupported by evidence. The argument that Plaintiffs might be forced to cut back on\nscholarly publications is speculative and unpersuasive on this record. . . . In summary,\nthere is no persuasive evidence that Plaintiffs' ability to publish high quality scholarly books\nwould be appreciably diminished by the modest relief from academic permissions payments\nwhich is at issue in this case. There certainly is no evidence that a modest reduction would\nimpact the desire or the ability of academic authors to publish new works. Making small\nfree excerpts available to students would further the spread of knowledge.\n\nSummary of Fair Use Assessment\nThis case involves unlicensed copying of 75 excerpts from Plaintiffs' copyrighted books for\nnonprofit educational use by professors and students at Georgia State University in 2009.\nThe question whether this constitutes a permissible fair use is resolved primarily by\nreference to 17 U.S.C. § 107 and the Supreme Court's decision in Campbell [Campbell v.\nAcuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994)]. The Court must consider all of the statutory\nelements of § 107; none may be overlooked. However, other factors may be considered.\nThere is no precise manner in which the elements must be weighed in relation to each other;\nhowever, it is paramount that all factors be weighed and considered \"in light of the purposes\nof copyright.\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578.\nBecause (1) the excerpts were used for the purpose of teaching (including multiple copies\nfor classroom use) and scholarship, as described in the preamble to § 107, (2) the use was\nfor a noncommercial, nonprofit educational use, as described in § 107(1) and (3) Georgia\nState is a nonprofit educational institution, fair use factor one weighs heavily in Defendants'\nfavor.\nBecause all of the excerpts are informational and educational in nature and none are\nfictional, fair use factor two weighs in favor of Defendants.\nWith respect to fair use factor three, the amount of the copying as a percentage of the book\nvaries from book to book. In determining what percentage of a book may be copied, the\nCourt looks first to the relationship between the length of the excerpt and the length of the\nbook as a whole. Then, the relationship between the value of the excerpt in relation to the\nvalue of the book is examined. The Court also considers the value of a chapter in itself\n(rather than just a few paragraphs). In the case of extra long books with a large number of\nchapters, a limit on the number of chapters which may be copied is appropriate. Professors\nmay well have a legitimate educational reason for wanting to use a chapter of a book; it is\nmore apt to contain a complete treatment of a particular topic or subtopic than would a few\nisolated paragraphs. However, the convenience of using whole chapters from an over-length\nbook may lead to an undue amount of unpaid copying in absolute terms.\nTaking into account the foregoing considerations in relation to the books involved in this\ncase, the factor three conclusions are: Where a book is not divided into chapters or contains\nfewer than ten chapters, unpaid copying of no more than 10% of the pages in the book is\npermissible under factor three. The pages are counted as previously set forth in this Order.\nIn practical effect, this will allow copying of about one chapter or its equivalent. Where a\nbook contains ten or more chapters, the unpaid copying of up to but no more than one\nchapter (or its equivalent) will be permissible under fair use factor three. Excerpts which fall\nwithin these limits are decidedly small, and allowable as such under factor three. Access\nshall be limited only to the students who are enrolled in the course in question, and then\nonly for the term of the course. Students must be reminded of the limitations of the\ncopyright laws and must be prohibited by policy from distributing copies to others. The\nchapter or other excerpt must fill a demonstrated, legitimate purpose in the course\n\ncurriculum and must be narrowly tailored to accomplish that purpose. Where the foregoing\nlimitations are met factor three will favor fair use, i.e., will favor Defendants. Otherwise\nfactor three will favor Plaintiffs.\nThe Court must also consider, under fair use factor four, the effect of the use in question on\nthe potential market for or value of the copyrighted book. Unpaid use of a decidedly small\nexcerpt (as defined under factor three) in itself will not cause harm to the potential market\nfor the copyrighted book. That is because a decidedly small excerpt does not substitute for\nthe book. However, where permissions are readily available from CCC or the publisher for a\ncopy of a small excerpt of a copyrighted book, at a reasonable price, and in a convenient\nformat (in this case, permissions for digital excerpts), and permissions are not paid, factor\nfour weighs heavily in Plaintiffs' favor. Factor four weighs in Defendants' favor when such\npermissions are not readily available.\nThe Court has considered whether unlicensed copying of small excerpts as contemplated by\nthis Order would disserve the purposes of the copyright laws, namely, \"To promote the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors\nthe exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl.\n8. Because the unpaid use of small excerpts will not discourage academic authors from\ncreating new works, will have no appreciable effect on Plaintiffs' ability to publish scholarly\nworks, and will promote the spread of knowledge, the Court concludes that it would not.\n* * *\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.628J / 6.903J Patents, Copyrights, and the Law of Intellectual Property\nSpring 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Works.\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\nMETRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC., et\nal., Petitioners,\nv.\nGROKSTER, LTD., et al.\n\nNo. 04-480.\nArgued March 29, 2005.\nDecided June 27, 2005.\n\nJustice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n\nThe question is under what circumstances the\ndistributor of a product capable of both lawful and\nunlawful use is liable for acts of copyright infringe-\nment by third parties using the product. We hold that\none who distributes a device with the object of pro-\nmoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear\nexpression or other affirmative steps taken to foster\ninfringement, is liable for the resulting acts of in-\nfringement by third parties.\n\nI\nA\nRespondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast\nNetworks, Inc., defendants in the trial court, distribute\nfree software products that allow computer users to\nshare electronic files through peer-to-peer networks,\nso called because users' computers communicate di-\nrectly with each other, not through central servers. The\nadvantage of peer-to-peer networks over information\nnetworks of other types shows up in their substantial\nand growing popularity. Because they need no central\ncomputer server to mediate the exchange of infor-\nmation or files among users, the high-bandwidth\ncommunications capacity for a server may be dis-\npensed with, and the need for costly server storage\nspace is eliminated. Since copies of a file (particularly\na popular one) are available on many users' computers,\nfile requests and retrievals may be faster than on other\ntypes of networks, and since file exchanges do not\ntravel through a server, communications can take\nplace between any computers that remain connected to\nthe network without risk that a glitch in the server will\ndisable the network in its entirety. Given these bene-\nfits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer\nnetworks are employed to store and distribute elec-\ntronic files by universities, government agencies,\ncorporations, and libraries, among others.\n\nOther users of peer-to-peer networks include in-\ndividual recipients of Grokster's and StreamCast's\nsoftware, and although the networks that they enjoy\nthrough using the software can be used to share any\ntype of digital file, they have prominently employed\nthose networks in sharing copyrighted music and\nvideo files without authorization. A group of copy-\nright holders (MGM for short, but including motion\npicture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and\nmusic publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for\ntheir users' copyright infringements, alleging that they\nknowingly and intentionally distributed their software\nto enable users to reproduce and distribute the copy-\nrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act, 17\nU.S.C. § 101 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. II).MGM\nsought damages and an injunction.\n\nDiscovery during the litigation revealed the way\nthe software worked, the business aims of each de-\nfendant company, and the predilections of the users.\nGrokster's eponymous software employs what is\nknown as FastTrack technology, a protocol developed\nby others and licensed to Grokster. StreamCast dis-\ntributes a very similar product except that its software,\ncalled Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutella\ntechnology. A user who downloads and installs either\nsoftware possesses the protocol to send requests for\nfiles directly to the computers of others using software\ncompatible with FastTrack or Gnutella. On the\nFastTrack network opened by the Grokster software,\nthe user's request goes to a computer given an index-\ning capacity by the software and designated a super-\nnode, or to some other computer with comparable\npower and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the\nfiles available on the computers of users connected to\nit. The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its\nown index and may communicate the search request to\nother supernodes. If the file is found, the supernode\ndiscloses its location to the computer requesting it, and\nthe requesting user can download the file directly from\nthe computer located. The copied file is placed in a\ndesignated sharing folder on the requesting user's\n\ncomputer, where it is available for other users to\ndownload in turn, along with any other file in that\nfolder.\n\nAlthough Grokster and StreamCast do not there-\nfore know when particular files are copied, a few\nsearches using their software would show what is\navailable on the networks the software reaches. MGM\ncommissioned a statistician to conduct a systematic\nsearch, and his study showed that nearly 90% of the\nfiles available for download on the FastTrack system\nwere copyrighted works. Grokster and StreamCast\ndispute this figure, raising methodological problems\nand arguing that free copying even of copyrighted\nworks may be authorized by the rightholders. They\nalso argue that potential noninfringing uses of their\nsoftware are significant in kind, even if infrequent in\npractice. Some musical performers, for example, have\ngained new audiences by distributing their copy-\nrighted works for free across peer-to-peer networks,\nand some distributors of unprotected content have\nused peer-to-peer networks to disseminate files,\nShakespeare being an example. Indeed, StreamCast\nhas given Morpheus users the opportunity to down-\nload the briefs in this very case, though their popular-\nity has not been quantified.\n\nAs for quantification, the parties' anecdotal and\nstatistical evidence entered thus far to show the con-\ntent available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks\ndoes not say much about which files are actually\ndownloaded by users, and no one can say how often\nthe software is used to obtain copies of unprotected\nmaterial. But MGM's evidence gives reason to think\nthat the vast majority of users' downloads are acts of\ninfringement, and because well over 100 million\ncopies of the software in question are known to have\nbeen downloaded, and billions of files are shared\nacross the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each\nmonth, the probable scope of copyright infringement\nis staggering.\n\nGrokster and StreamCast concede the infringe-\nment in most downloads, and it is uncontested that\nthey are aware that users employ their software pri-\nmarily to download copyrighted files, even if the\ndecentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to\nreveal which files are being copied, and when. From\ntime to time, moreover, the companies have learned\nabout their users' infringement directly, as from users\nwho have sent e-mail to each company with questions\nabout playing copyrighted movies they had down-\nloaded, to whom the companies have responded with\nguidance. And MGM notified the companies of 8\nmillion copyrighted files that could be obtained using\ntheir software.\n\nGrokster and StreamCast are not, however,\nmerely passive recipients of information about in-\nfringing use. The record is replete with evidence that\nfrom the moment Grokster and StreamCast began to\ndistribute their free software, each one clearly voiced\nthe objective that recipients use it to download copy-\nrighted works, and each took active steps to encourage\ninfringement.\n\nIn addition to this evidence of express promotion,\nmarketing, and intent to promote further, the business\nmodels employed by Grokster and StreamCast con-\nfirm that their principal object was use of their soft-\nware to download copyrighted works. Grokster and\nStreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain\nthe software itself for nothing. Instead, both compa-\nnies generate income by selling advertising space, and\nthey stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus\nusers while they are employing the programs. As the\nnumber of users of each program increases, advertis-\ning opportunities become worth more. While there is\ndoubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the\nevidence shows that substantive volume is a function\nof free access to copyrighted work. Users seeking Top\n40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest\nMouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those\nseeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and\nStreamCast translated that demand into dollars.\n\nB\nAfter discovery, the parties on each side of the\ncase cross-moved for summary judgment. The District\nCourt limited its consideration to the asserted liability\nof Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the cur-\nrent versions of their software, leaving aside whether\neither was liable \"for damages arising from past ver-\nsions of their software, or from other past activities.\"\n259 F.Supp.2d 1029, 1033 (C.D.Cal.2003). The Dis-\ntrict Court held that those who used the Grokster and\nMorpheus software to download copyrighted media\nfiles directly infringed MGM's copyrights, a conclu-\nsion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and\nStreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution\nof the then-current versions of their software. Dis-\n\ntributing that software gave rise to no liability in the\ncourt's view, because its use did not provide the dis-\ntributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of\ninfringement.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed. 380 F.3d 1154\n(C.A.9 2004). In the court's analysis, a defendant was\nliable as a contributory infringer when it had\nknowledge of direct infringement and materially con-\ntributed to the infringement. But the court read Sony\nCorp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464\nU.S. 417, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984), as\nholding that distribution of a commercial product\ncapable of substantial noninfringing uses could not\ngive rise to contributory liability for infringement\nunless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific\ninstances of infringement and failed to act on that\nknowledge. The fact that the software was capable of\nsubstantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuit's\nview meant that Grokster and StreamCast were not\nliable, because they had no such actual knowledge,\nowing to the decentralized architecture of their soft-\nware. The court also held that Grokster and Stream-\nCast did not materially contribute to their users' in-\nfringement because it was the users themselves who\nsearched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files,\nwith no involvement by the defendants beyond\nproviding the software in the first place.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit also considered whether\nGrokster and StreamCast could be liable under a the-\nory of vicarious infringement. The court held against\nliability because the defendants did not monitor or\ncontrol the use of the software, had no agreed-upon\nright or current ability to supervise its use, and had no\nindependent duty to police infringement. We granted\ncertiorari.\n\nII\nA\nMGM and many of the amici fault the Court of\nAppeals's holding for upsetting a sound balance be-\ntween the respective values of supporting creative\npursuits through copyright protection and promoting\ninnovation in new communication technologies by\nlimiting the incidence of liability for copyright in-\nfringement. The more artistic protection is favored,\nthe more technological innovation may be discour-\naged; the administration of copyright law is an exer-\ncise in managing the tradeoff..\n\nThe tension between the two values is the subject\nof this case, with its claim that digital distribution of\ncopyrighted material threatens copyright holders as\nnever before, because every copy is identical to the\noriginal, copying is easy, and many people (especially\nthe young) use file-sharing software to download\ncopyrighted works. This very breadth of the software's\nuse may well draw the public directly into the debate\nover copyright policy, and the indications are that the\nease of copying songs or movies using software like\nGrokster's and Napster's is fostering disdain for cop-\nyright protection, As the case has been presented to us,\nthese fears are said to be offset by the different con-\ncern that imposing liability, not only on infringers but\non distributors of software based on its potential for\nunlawful use, could limit further development of\nbeneficial technologies.\n\nThe mutual exclusivity of these values should not\nbe overstated, however. On the one hand technologi-\ncal innovators, including those writing file-sharing\ncomputer programs, may wish for effective copyright\nprotections for their work. On the other hand the\nwidespread distribution of creative works through\nimproved technologies may enable the synthesis of\nnew works or generate audiences for emerging artists.\n\nThe argument for imposing indirect liability in\nthis case is, however, a powerful one, given the\nnumber of infringing downloads that occur every day\nusing StreamCast's and Grokster's software. When a\nwidely shared service or product is used to commit\ninfringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in\nthe protected work effectively against all direct in-\nfringers, the only practical alternative being to go\nagainst the distributor of the copying device for sec-\nondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicari-\nous infringement. .\n\nOne infringes contributorily by intentionally\ninducing or encouraging direct infringement,\nand infringes vicariously by profiting from\ndirect infringement while declining to exer-\ncise a right to stop or limit it. Although \"[t]he\nCopyright Act does not expressly render\nanyone liable for infringement committed by\nanother,\" these doctrines of secondary lia-\nbility emerged from common law principles\nand are well established in the law,\n\nB\nDespite the currency of these principles of sec-\nondary liability, this Court has dealt with secondary\ncopyright infringement in only one recent case, and\nbecause MGM has tailored its principal claim to our\nopinion there, a look at our earlier holding is in order.\nIn Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, this Court\naddressed a claim that secondary liability for in-\nfringement can arise from the very distribution of a\ncommercial product. There, the product, novel at the\ntime, was what we know today as the videocassette\nrecorder or VCR. Copyright holders sued Sony as the\nmanufacturer, claiming it was contributorily liable for\ninfringement that occurred when VCR owners taped\ncopyrighted programs because it supplied the means\nused to infringe, and it had constructive knowledge\nthat infringement would occur. At the trial on the\nmerits, the evidence showed that the principal use of\nthe VCR was for \" 'time-shifting,' \" or taping a pro-\ngram for later viewing at a more convenient time,\nwhich the Court found to be a fair, not an infringing,\nuse. There was no evidence that Sony had expressed\nan object of bringing about taping in violation of\ncopyright or had taken active steps to increase its\nprofits from unlawful taping. Although Sony's adver-\ntisements urged consumers to buy the VCR to \" 'rec-\nord favorite shows' \" or \" 'build a library' \" of rec-\norded programs, neither of these uses was necessarily\ninfringing,\n\nOn those facts, with no evidence of stated or in-\ndicated intent to promote infringing uses, the only\nconceivable basis for imposing liability was on a the-\nory of contributory infringement arising from its sale\nof VCRs to consumers with knowledge that some\nwould use them to infringe. But because the VCR was\n\"capable of commercially significant noninfringing\nuses,\" we held the manufacturer could not be faulted\nsolely on the basis of its distribution.\n\nThis analysis reflected patent law's traditional\nstaple article of commerce doctrine, now codified, that\ndistribution of a component of a patented device will\nnot violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other\nways. The doctrine was devised to identify instances\nin which it may be presumed from distribution of an\narticle in commerce that the distributor intended the\narticle to be used to infringe another's patent, and so\nmay justly be held liable for that infringement. \"One\nwho makes and sells articles which are only adapted to\nbe used in a patented combination will be presumed to\nintend the natural consequences of his acts; he will be\npresumed to intend that they shall be used in the\ncombination of the patent.\"\n\nIn sum, where an article is \"good for nothing else\"\nbut infringement, there is no legitimate public interest\nin its unlicensed availability, and there is no injustice\nin presuming or imputing an intent to infringe. Con-\nversely, the doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct\nof selling an item with substantial lawful as well as\nunlawful uses, and limits liability to instances of more\nacute fault than the mere understanding that some of\none's products will be misused. It leaves breathing\nroom for innovation and a vigorous commerce. .\n\nThe parties and many of the amici in this case\nthink the key to resolving it is the Sony rule and, in\nparticular, what it means for a product to be \"capable\nof commercially significant noninfringing uses.\"\nMGM advances the argument that granting summary\njudgment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their cur-\nrent activities gave too much weight to the value of\ninnovative technology, and too little to the copyrights\ninfringed by users of their software, given that 90% of\nworks available on one of the networks was shown to\nbe copyrighted. Assuming the remaining 10% to be its\nnoninfringing use, MGM says this should not qualify\nas \"substantial,\" and the Court should quantify Sony to\nthe extent of holding that a product used \"principally\"\nfor infringement does not qualify. As mentioned be-\nfore, Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evi-\ndence that their software can be used to reproduce\npublic domain works, and they point to copyright\nholders who actually encourage copying. Even if\ninfringement is the principal practice with their soft-\nware today, they argue, the noninfringing uses are\nsignificant and will grow.\n\nWe agree with MGM that the Court of Appeals\nmisapplied Sony, which it read as limiting secondary\nliability quite beyond the circumstances to which the\ncase applied. Sony barred secondary liability based on\npresuming or imputing intent to cause infringement\nsolely from the design or distribution of a product\ncapable of substantial lawful use, which the distributor\nknows is in fact used for infringement. The Ninth\nCircuit has read Sony's limitation to mean that\nwhenever a product is capable of substantial lawful\nuse, the producer can never be held contributorily\nliable for third parties' infringing use of it; it read the\nrule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose\n\nto cause infringing use is shown by evidence inde-\npendent of design and distribution of the product,\nunless the distributors had \"specific knowledge of\ninfringement at a time at which they contributed to the\ninfringement, and failed to act upon that information.\"\nBecause the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grok-\nster software capable of substantial lawful use, it\nconcluded on the basis of its reading of Sony that\nneither company could be held liable, since there was\nno showing that their software, being without any\ncentral server, afforded them knowledge of specific\nunlawful uses.\n\nThis view of Sony, however, was error, convert-\ning the case from one about liability resting on im-\nputed intent to one about liability on any theory. Be-\ncause Sony did not displace other theories of second-\nary liability, and because we find below that it was\nerror to grant summary judgment to the companies on\nMGM's inducement claim, we do not revisit Sony\nfurther, as MGM requests, to add a more quantified\ndescription of the point of balance between protection\nand commerce when liability rests solely on distribu-\ntion with knowledge that unlawful use will occur. It is\nenough to note that the Ninth Circuit's judgment rested\non an erroneous understanding of Sony and to leave\nfurther consideration of the Sony rule for a day when\nthat may be required.\n\nC\nSony's rule limits imputing culpable intent as a\nmatter of law from the characteristics or uses of a\ndistributed product. But nothing in Sony requires\ncourts to ignore evidence of intent if there is such\nevidence, and the case was never meant to foreclose\nrules of fault-based liability derived from the common\nlaw. Thus, where evidence goes beyond a product's\ncharacteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to\ninfringing uses, and shows statements or actions di-\nrected to promoting infringement, Sony's staple-article\nrule will not preclude liability.\n\nThe classic case of direct evidence of unlawful\npurpose occurs when one induces commission of\ninfringement by another, or \"entic[es] or persuad[es]\nanother\" to infringe, Black's Law Dictionary 790 (8th\ned.2004), as by advertising. Thus at common law a\ncopyright or patent defendant who \"not only expected\nbut invoked [infringing use] by advertisement\" was\nliable for infringement \"on principles recognized in\nevery part of the law.\" Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers,\n222 U.S., at 62-63, 32 S.Ct. 20 (copyright infringe-\nment). See also Henry v. A.B. Dick Co., 224 U.S., at\n48-49, 32 S.Ct. 364 (contributory liability for patent\ninfringement may be found where a good's \"most\nconspicuous use is one which will co-operate in an\ninfringement when sale to such user is invoked by\nadvertisement\" of the infringing use); Thom-\nson-Houston Electric Co. v. Kelsey Electric R. Spe-\ncialty Co., 75 F. 1005, 1007-1008 (C.A.2 1896) (re-\nlying on advertisements and displays to find defend-\nant's \"willingness ... to aid other persons in any at-\ntempts which they may be disposed to make towards\n[patent] infringement\"); Rumford Chemical Works v.\nHecker, 20 F.Cas. 1342, 1346 (No. 12,133)\n(C.C.D.N.J.1876) (demonstrations of infringing ac-\ntivity along with \"avowals of the [infringing] purpose\nand use for which it was made\" supported liability for\npatent infringement).\n\nThe rule on inducement of infringement as de-\nveloped in the early cases is no different today. Evi-\ndence of \"active steps ... taken to encourage direct\ninfringement,\" such as advertising an infringing use or\ninstructing how to engage in an infringing use, show\nan affirmative intent that the product be used to in-\nfringe, and a showing that infringement was encour-\naged overcomes the law's reluctance to find liability\nwhen a defendant merely sells a commercial product\nsuitable for some lawful use..\n\nFor the same reasons that Sony took the sta-\nple-article doctrine of patent law as a model for its\ncopyright safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is\na sensible one for copyright. We adopt it here, holding\nthat one who distributes a device with the object of\npromoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by\nclear expression or other affirmative steps taken to\nfoster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of\ninfringement by third parties. We are, of course,\nmindful of the need to keep from trenching on regular\ncommerce or discouraging the development of tech-\nnologies with lawful and unlawful potential. Accord-\ningly, just as Sony did not find intentional inducement\ndespite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that\nits device could be used to infringe, mere knowledge\nof infringing potential or of actual infringing uses\nwould not be enough here to subject a distributor to\nliability. Nor would ordinary acts incident to product\ndistribution, such as offering customers technical\nsupport or product updates, support liability in them-\nselves. The inducement rule, instead, premises liabil-\n\nity on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct,\nand thus does nothing to compromise legitimate\ncommerce or discourage innovation having a lawful\npromise.\n\nIII\nA\nThe only apparent question about treating MGM's\nevidence as sufficient to withstand summary judgment\nunder the theory of inducement goes to the need on\nMGM's part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and\nGrokster communicated an inducing message to their\nsoftware users. The classic instance of inducement is\nby advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a\nmessage designed to stimulate others to commit vio-\nlations. MGM claims that such a message is shown\nhere. It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the\ncomputer screens of users of Napster-compatible\nprograms ads urging the adoption of its OpenNap\nprogram, which was designed, as its name implied, to\ninvite the custom of patrons of Napster, then under\nattack in the courts for facilitating massive infringe-\nment. Those who accepted StreamCast's OpenNap\nprogram were offered software to perform the same\nservices, which a factfinder could conclude would\nreadily have been understood in the Napster market as\nthe ability to download copyrighted music files.\nGrokster distributed an electronic newsletter con-\ntaining links to articles promoting its software's ability\nto access popular copyrighted music. And anyone\nwhose Napster or free file-sharing searches turned up\na link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to\nbe offering the same file-sharing ability as Napster,\nand to the same people who probably used Napster for\ninfringing downloads; that would also have been the\nunderstanding of anyone offered Grokster's sugges-\ntively named Swaptor software, its version of Open-\nNap. And both companies communicated a clear\nmessage by responding affirmatively to requests for\nhelp in locating and playing copyrighted materials.\n\nIn StreamCast's case, of course, the evidence just\ndescribed was supplemented by other unequivocal\nindications of unlawful purpose in the internal com-\nmunications and advertising designs aimed at Napster\nusers (\"When the lights went off at Napster ... where\ndid the users go?\" Whether the messages were\ncommunicated is not to the point on this record. The\nfunction of the message in the theory of inducement is\nto prove by a defendant's own statements that his\nunlawful purpose disqualifies him from claiming\nprotection (and incidentally to point to actual violators\nlikely to be found among those who hear or read the\nmessage). See supra, at 2779-2780. Proving that a\nmessage was sent out, then, is the preeminent but not\nexclusive way of showing that active steps were taken\nwith the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and\nof showing that infringing acts took place by using the\ndevice distributed. Here, the summary judgment rec-\nord is replete with other evidence that Grokster and\nStreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in\nSony, acted with a purpose to cause copyright viola-\ntions by use of software suitable for illegal use. See\nsupra, at 2772-2774.\n\nThree features of this evidence of intent are par-\nticularly notable. First, each company showed itself to\nbe aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for\ncopyright infringement, the market comprising former\nNapster users. StreamCast's internal documents made\nconstant reference to Napster, it initially distributed its\nMorpheus software through an OpenNap program\ncompatible with Napster, it advertised its OpenNap\nprogram to Napster users, and its Morpheus software\nfunctions as Napster did except that it could be used to\ndistribute more kinds of files, including copyrighted\nmovies and software programs. Grokster's name is\napparently derived from Napster, it too initially of-\nfered an OpenNap program, its software's function is\nlikewise comparable to Napster's, and it attempted to\ndivert queries for Napster onto its own Web site.\nGrokster and StreamCast's efforts to supply services to\nformer Napster users, deprived of a mechanism to\ncopy and distribute what were overwhelmingly in-\nfringing files, indicate a principal, if not exclusive,\nintent on the part of each to bring about infringement.\n\nSecond, this evidence of unlawful objective is\ngiven added significance by MGM's showing that\nneither company attempted to develop filtering tools\nor other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activ-\nity using their software. While the Ninth Circuit\ntreated the defendants' failure to develop such tools as\nirrelevant because they lacked an independent duty to\nmonitor their users' activity, we think this evidence\nunderscores Grokster's and StreamCast's intentional\nfacilitation of their users' infringement.\n\nThird, there is a further complement to the direct\nevidence of unlawful objective. It is useful to recall\nthat StreamCast and Grokster make money by selling\nadvertising space, by directing ads to the screens of\n\ncomputers employing their software. As the record\nshows, the more the software is used, the more ads are\nsent out and the greater the advertising revenue be-\ncomes. Since the extent of the software's use deter-\nmines the gain to the distributors, the commercial\nsense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use,\nwhich the record shows is infringing. This evidence\nalone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent,\nbut viewed in the context of the entire record its im-\nport is clear.\n\nThe unlawful objective is unmistakable.\n\nB\nIn addition to intent to bring about infringement\nand distribution of a device suitable for infringing use,\nthe inducement theory of course requires evidence of\nactual infringement by recipients of the device, the\nsoftware in this case. As the account of the facts in-\ndicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic\nscale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of\nMGM's showing on this point in order to survive the\ncompanies' summary judgment requests. Although an\nexact calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a\nclaim of damages, is subject to dispute, there is no\nquestion that the summary judgment evidence is at\nleast adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with\nclaims for damages and equitable relief.\n\nIn sum, this case is significantly different from\nSony and reliance on that case to rule in favor of\nStreamCast and Grokster was error. Sony dealt with a\nclaim of liability based solely on distributing a product\nwith alternative lawful and unlawful uses, with\nknowledge that some users would follow the unlawful\ncourse. The case struck a balance between the interests\nof protection and innovation by holding that the\nproduct's capability of substantial lawful employment\nshould bar the imputation of fault and consequent\nsecondary liability for the unlawful acts of others.\n\nMGM's evidence in this case most obviously ad-\ndresses a different basis of liability for distributing a\nproduct open to alternative uses. Here, evidence of the\ndistributors' words and deeds going beyond distribu-\ntion as such shows a purpose to cause and profit from\nthird-party acts of copyright infringement. If liability\nfor inducing infringement is ultimately found, it will\nnot be on the basis of presuming or imputing fault, but\nfrom inferring a patently illegal objective from\nstatements and actions showing what that objective\nwas.\n\nThere is substantial evidence in MGM's favor on\nall elements of inducement, and summary judgment in\nfavor of Grokster and StreamCast was error. On re-\nmand, reconsideration of MGM's motion for summary\njudgment will be in order.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nJustice GINSBURG, with whom THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY join, concurring\n\nI concur in the Court's decision, which vacates in\nfull the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit, and write separately to clarify why I conclude\nthat the Court of Appeals misperceived, and hence\nmisapplied, our holding in Sony Corp. of America v.\nUniversal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 104 S.Ct.\n774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984). There is here at least a\n\"genuine issue as to [a] material fact,\" Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 56(c), on the liability of Grokster or StreamCast,\nnot only for actively inducing copyright infringement,\nbut also, or alternatively, based on the distribution of\ntheir software products, for contributory copyright\ninfringement. On neither score was summary judg-\nment for Grokster and StreamCast warranted.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit went astray, I will endeavor to\nexplain, when that court granted summary judgment to\nGrokster and StreamCast on the charge of contribu-\ntory liability based on distribution of their software\nproducts. Relying on its earlier opinion in A & M\nRecords, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (C.A.9\n2001), the Court of Appeals held that \"if substantial\nnoninfringing use was shown, the copyright owner\nwould be required to show that the defendant had\nreasonable knowledge of specific infringing files.\"\n380 F.3d 1154, 1161 (C.A.9 2004). \"A careful ex-\namination of the record,\" the court concluded, \"indi-\ncates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as\nto noninfringing use.\" Ibid. The appeals court pointed\nto the band Wilco, which made one of its albums\navailable for free downloading, to other recording\nartists who may have authorized free distribution of\ntheir music through the Internet, and to public domain\nliterary works and films available through Grokster's\n\nand StreamCast's software. Ibid. Although it\nacknowledged petitioners' (hereinafter MGM) asser-\ntion that \"the vast majority of the software use is for\ncopyright infringement,\" the court concluded that\nGrokster's and StreamCast's proffered evidence met\nSony's requirement that \"a product need only be ca-\npable of substantial noninfringing uses.\" .\n\nThis case differs markedly from Sony. Here, there\nhas been no finding of any fair use and little beyond\nanecdotal evidence of noninfringing uses. In finding\nthe Grokster and StreamCast software products capa-\nble of substantial noninfringing uses, the District\nCourt and the Court of Appeals appear to have relied\nlargely on declarations submitted by the defendants.\nThese declarations include assertions (some of them\nhearsay) that a number of copyright owners authorize\ndistribution of their works on the Internet and that\nsome public domain material is available through\npeer-to-peer networks including those accessed\nthrough Grokster's and StreamCast's software.\n\nIn sum, when the record in this case was devel-\noped, there was evidence that Grokster's and\nStreamCast's products were, and had been for some\ntime, overwhelmingly used to infringe, and that this\ninfringement was the overwhelming source of revenue\nfrom the products. Fairly appraised, the evidence was\ninsufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a\nreasonable prospect that substantial or commercially\nsignificant noninfringing uses were likely to develop\nover time. On this record, the District Court should not\nhave ruled dispositively on the contributory in-\nfringement charge by granting summary judgment to\nGrokster and StreamCast.\n\nIf, on remand, the case is not resolved on sum-\nmary judgment in favor of MGM based on Grokster\nand StreamCast actively inducing infringement, the\nCourt of Appeals, I would emphasize, should recon-\nsider, on a fuller record, its interpretation of Sony's\nproduct distribution holding.\n\nJustice BREYER, with whom Justice STEVENS\nand Justice O'CONNOR join, concurring.\n\nI agree with the Court that the distributor of a\ndual-use technology may be liable for the infringing\nactivities of third parties where he or she actively\nseeks to advance the infringement. I further agree that,\nin light of our holding today, we need not now \"re-\nvisit\" Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios,\nInc., 464 U.S. 417, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574\n(1984). Other Members of the Court, however, take up\nthe Sony question: whether Grokster's product is\n\"capable of 'substantial' or 'commercially significant'\nnoninfringing uses.\" (GINSBURG, J., concurring)\n(quoting Sony, supra, at 442, 104 S.Ct. 774). And they\nanswer that question by stating that the Court of Ap-\npeals was wrong when it granted summary judgment\non the issue in Grokster's favor. I write to explain why\nI disagree with them on this matter.\n\nI\nA\nI begin with Sony's standard. In Sony, the Court\nconsidered the potential copyright liability of a com-\npany that did not itself illegally copy protected mate-\nrial, but rather sold a machine-a videocassette recorder\n(VCR)-that could be used to do so. A buyer could use\nthat machine for non-infringing purposes, such as\nrecording for later viewing (sometimes called\n\" 'time-shifting,' \" Sony, 464 U.S., at 421, 104 S.Ct.\n774) uncopyrighted television programs or copy-\nrighted programs with a copyright holder's permission.\nThe buyer could use the machine for infringing pur-\nposes as well, such as building libraries of taped cop-\nyrighted programs. Or, the buyer might use the ma-\nchine to record copyrighted programs under circum-\nstances in which the legal status of the act of recording\nwas uncertain (i.e., where the copying may, or may not,\nhave constituted a \"fair use.\" Sony knew many cus-\ntomers would use its VCRs to engage in unauthorized\ncopying and \" 'library-building.' \" But that fact, said\nthe Court, was insufficient to make Sony itself an\ninfringer. And the Court ultimately held that Sony was\nnot liable for its customers' acts of infringement.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court recognized\nthe need for the law, in fixing secondary copyright\nliability, to \"strike a balance between a copyright\nholder's legitimate demand for effective-not merely\nsymbolic-protection of the statutory monopoly, and\nthe rights of others freely to engage in substantially\nunrelated areas of commerce.\" It pointed to patent\nlaw's \"staple article of commerce\" doctrine, ibid.,\nunder which a distributor of a product is not liable for\npatent infringement by its customers unless that\nproduct is \"unsuited for any commercial noninfringing\nuse.\" The Court wrote that the sale of copying\nequipment, \"like the sale of other articles of commerce,\n\ndoes not constitute contributory infringement if the\nproduct is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable\npurposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of sub-\nstantial noninfringing uses.\" The Court ultimately\ncharacterized the legal \"question\" in the particular\ncase as \"whether [Sony's VCR] is capable of com-\nmercially significant noninfringing uses.\"\n\nThe Court found that the magnitude of authorized\nprogramming was \"significant,\" and it also noted the\n\"significant potential for future authorized copying.\"\nThe Court supported this conclusion by referencing\nthe trial testimony of professional sports league offi-\ncials and a religious broadcasting representative. It\nalso discussed (1) a Los Angeles educational station\naffiliated with the Public Broadcasting Service that\nmade many of its programs available for home taping,\nand (2) Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, a widely watched\nchildren's program. On the basis of this testimony and\nother similar evidence, the Court determined that\nproducers of this kind had authorized duplication of\ntheir copyrighted programs \"in significant enough\nnumbers to create a substantial market for a nonin-\nfringing use of the\" VCR..\n\nThe Court, in using the key word \"substantial,\"\nindicated that these circumstances alone constituted a\nsufficient basis for rejecting the imposition of sec-\nondary liability. (\"Sony demonstrated a significant\nlikelihood that substantial numbers of copyright\nholders\" would not object to time-shifting. Nonethe-\nless, the Court buttressed its conclusion by finding\nseparately that, in any event, un authorized\ntime-shifting often constituted not infringement, but\n\"fair use.\" .\n\nB\nWhen measured against Sony's underlying evi-\ndence and analysis, the evidence now before us shows\nthat Grokster passes Sony's test-that is, whether the\ncompany's product is capable of substantial or com-\nmercially significant noninfringing uses. For one\nthing, petitioners' (hereinafter MGM) own expert\ndeclared that 75% of current files available on Grok-\nster are infringing and 15% are \"likely infringing.\"\nThat leaves some number of files near 10% that ap-\nparently are noninfringing, a figure very similar to the\n9% or so of authorized time-shifting uses of the VCR\nthat the Court faced in Sony.\n\nAs in Sony, witnesses here explained the nature of\nthe noninfringing files on Grokster's network without\ndetailed quantification. Those files include authorized\ncopies of music by artists such as Wilco, Janis Ian,\nPearl Jam, Dave Matthews, John Mayer, and others.\n\nThe nature of these and other lawfully swapped\nfiles is such that it is reasonable to infer quantities of\ncurrent lawful use roughly approximate to those at\nissue in Sony. At least, MGM has offered no evidence\nsufficient to survive summary judgment that could\nplausibly demonstrate a significant quantitative dif-\nference. To be sure, in quantitative terms these uses\naccount for only a small percentage of the total num-\nber of uses of Grokster's product. But the same was\ntrue in Sony, which characterized the relatively limited\nauthorized copying market as \"substantial.\" (The\nCourt made clear as well in Sony that the amount of\nmaterial then presently available for lawful copying-if\nnot actually copied-was significant, and the same is\ncertainly true in this case.)\n\nImportantly, Sony also used the word \"capable,\"\nasking whether the product is \"capable of \" substantial\nnoninfringing uses. Its language and analysis suggest\nthat a figure like 10%, if fixed for all time, might well\nprove insufficient, but that such a figure serves as an\nadequate foundation where there is a reasonable pro-\nspect of expanded legitimate uses over time. See ibid.\n(noting a \"significant potential for future authorized\ncopying\"). And its language also indicates*954 the\nappropriateness of looking to potential future uses of\nthe product to determine its \"capability.\"\n\nHere the record reveals a significant future market\nfor noninfringing uses of Grokster-type peer-to-peer\nsoftware. Such software permits the exchange of any\nsort of digital file-whether that file does, or does not,\ncontain copyrighted material. As more and more un-\ncopyrighted information is stored in swappable form,\nit seems a likely inference that lawful peer-to-peer\nsharing will become increasingly prevalent. .\n\nAnd that is just what is happening. Such legiti-\nmate noninfringing uses are coming to include the\nswapping of: research information (the initial purpose\nof many peer-to-peer networks); public domain films\n(e.g., those owned by the Prelinger Archive); histor-\nical recordings and digital educational materials (e.g.,\nthose stored on the Internet Archive); digital photos\n(OurPictures, for example, is starting a P2P pho-\nto-swapping service); \"shareware\" and \"freeware\"\n\n(e.g., Linux and certain Windows software); secure\nlicensed music and movie files (Intent MediaWorks,\nfor example, protects licensed content sent across P2P\nnetworks); news broadcasts past and present (the\nBBC Creative Archive lets users \"rip, mix and share\nthe BBC\"); user-created audio and video files (in-\ncluding \"podcasts\" that may be distributed through\nP2P software); and all manner of free \"open content\"\nworks collected by Creative Commons (one can search\nfor Creative Commons material on StreamCast)..\n\nThere may be other now-unforeseen noninfring-\ning uses that develop for peer-to-peer software, just as\nthe home-video rental industry (unmentioned in Sony)\ndeveloped for the VCR. But the foreseeable devel-\nopment of such uses, when taken together with an\nestimated 10% noninfringing material, is sufficient to\nmeet Sony's standard. And while Sony considered the\nrecord following a trial, there are no facts asserted by\nMGM in its summary judgment filings that lead me to\nbelieve the outcome after a trial here could be any\ndifferent. The lower courts reached the same conclu-\nsion.\n\nOf course, Grokster itself may not want to de-\nvelop these other noninfringing uses. But Sony's\nstandard seeks to protect not the Groksters of this\nworld (which in any event may well be liable under\ntoday's holding), but the development of technology\nmore generally. And Grokster's desires in this respect\nare beside the point.\n\nII\nThe real question here, I believe, is not whether\nthe record evidence satisfies Sony. As I have inter-\npreted the standard set forth in that case, it does. And\nof the Courts of Appeals that have considered the\nmatter, only one has proposed interpreting Sony more\nstrictly than I would do-in a case where the product\nmight have failed under any standard. .\n\nInstead, the real question is whether we should\nmodify the Sony standard, as MGM requests, or in-\nterpret Sony more strictly, as I believe Justice\nGINSBURG's approach would do in practice.\n\nAs I have said, Sony itself sought to \"strike a\nbalance between a copyright holder's legitimate de-\nmand for effective-not merely symbolic-protection of\nthe statutory monopoly, and the rights of others freely\nto engage in substantially unrelated areas of com-\nmerce.\" Thus, to determine whether modification, or a\nstrict interpretation, of Sony is needed, I would ask\nwhether MGM has shown that Sony incorrectly bal-\nanced copyright and new-technology interests. In\nparticular: (1) Has Sony (as I interpret it) worked to\nprotect new technology? (2) If so, would modification\nor strict interpretation significantly weaken that pro-\ntection? (3) If so, would new or necessary copy-\nright-related benefits outweigh any such weakening?\n\nA\nThe first question is the easiest to answer. Sony's\nrule, as I interpret it, has provided entrepreneurs with\nneeded assurance that they will be shielded from\ncopyright liability as they bring valuable new tech-\nnologies to market.\n\nSony's rule is clear. That clarity allows those who\ndevelop new products that are capable of substantial\nnoninfringing uses to know, ex ante, that distribution\nof their product will not yield massive monetary lia-\nbility. At the same time, it helps deter them from dis-\ntributing products that have no other real function\nthan-or that are specifically intended for-copyright\ninfringement, deterrence that the Court's holding to-\nday reinforces (by adding a weapon to the copyright\nholder's legal arsenal).\n\nSony's rule is strongly technology protecting. The\nrule deliberately makes it difficult for courts to find\nsecondary liability where new technology is at issue. It\nestablishes that the law will not impose copyright\nliability upon the distributors of dual-use technologies\n(who do not themselves engage in unauthorized cop-\nying) unless the product in question will be used al-\nmost exclusively to infringe copyrights (or unless they\nactively induce infringements as we today describe).\nSony thereby recognizes that the copyright laws are\nnot intended to discourage or to control the emergence\nof new technologies, including (perhaps especially)\nthose that help disseminate information and ideas\nmore broadly or more efficiently. Thus Sony's **2792\nrule shelters VCRs, typewriters, tape recorders, pho-\ntocopiers, computers, cassette players, compact disc\nburners, digital video recorders, MP3 players, Internet\nsearch engines, and peer-to-peer software. But Sony's\nrule does not shelter descramblers, even if one could\ntheoretically use a descrambler in a noninfringing way.\n464 *958 U.S., at 441-442, 104 S.Ct. 774. Ca-\nble/Home Communication Corp., supra, at 837-850\n(developer liable for advertising television signal\n\ndescrambler), with Vault Corp., supra, at 262 (pri-\nmary use infringing but a substantial noninfringing\nuse).\n\nSony's rule is forward looking. It does not confine\nits scope to a static snapshot of a product's current uses\n(thereby threatening technologies that have undevel-\noped future markets). Rather, as the VCR example\nmakes clear, a product's market can evolve dramati-\ncally over time. And Sony-by referring to a capacity\nfor substantial noninfringing uses-recognizes that fact.\nSony's word \"capable\" refers to a plausible, not simply\na theoretical, likelihood that such uses will come to\npass, and that fact anchors Sony in practical reality. Cf.\nAimster, 334 F.3d, at 651.\n\nSony's rule is mindful of the limitations facing\njudges where matters of technology are concerned.\nJudges have no specialized technical ability to answer\nquestions about present or future technological feasi-\nbility or commercial viability where technology pro-\nfessionals, engineers, and venture capitalists them-\nselves may radically disagree and where answers may\ndiffer depending upon whether one focuses upon the\ntime of product development or the time of distribu-\ntion. Consider, for example, the question whether\ndevices can be added to Grokster's software that will\nfilter out infringing files. MGM tells us this is easy\nenough to do, as do several amici that produce and sell\nthe filtering technology. See, e.g., Brief for Motion\nPicture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners\n11; Brief for Audible Magic Corp. et al. as Amici\nCuriae 3-10. Grokster says it is not at all easy to do,\nand not an efficient solution in any event, and several\napparently disinterested computer science professors\nagree. See Brief for Respondents 31; Brief for Com-\nputer Science Professor Harold Abelson et al. as Amici\nCuriae 6-10, 14-18. Which account should a judge\ncredit? Sony says that the judge will not necessarily\nhave to decide.\n\nGiven the nature of the Sony rule, it is not sur-\nprising that in the last 20 years, there have been rela-\ntively few contributory infringement suits-based on a\nproduct distribution theory-brought against technol-\nogy providers (a small handful of federal appellate\ncourt cases and perhaps fewer than two dozen District\nCourt cases in the last 20 years). I have found nothing\nin the briefs or the record that shows that Sony has\nfailed to achieve its innovation-protecting objective.\n\nB\nThe second, more difficult, question is whether a\nmodified Sony rule (or a strict interpretation) would\nsignificantly weaken the law's ability to protect new\ntechnology. Justice GINSBURG's approach would\nrequire defendants to produce considerably more\nconcrete evidence-more than was presented here-to\nearn Sony's shelter. That heavier evidentiary demand,\nand especially the more dramatic (case-by-case bal-\nancing) modifications that MGM and the Government\nseek, would, I believe, undercut the protection that\nSony now offers.\n\nTo require defendants to provide, for example,\ndetailed evidence-say, business plans, profitability\nestimates, projected technological modifications, and\nso forth-would doubtless make life easier for copy-\nright holder plaintiffs. But it would simultaneously\nincrease the legal uncertainty **2793 that surrounds\nthe creation or development of a new technology\ncapable of being put to infringing uses. Inventors and\nentrepreneurs (in the garage, the dorm room, the\ncorporate lab, or the boardroom) would have to fear\n(and in many cases endure) costly and extensive trials\nwhen they create, produce, or distribute the sort of\ninformation technology that can be used for copyright\ninfringement. They would often be left guessing as to\nhow a court, upon later review of the product and its\nuses, would decide when necessarily rough estimates\namounted to sufficient evidence. They would have no\nway to predict how courts would weigh the respective\nvalues of infringing and noninfringing uses; determine\nthe efficiency and advisability of technological\nchanges; or assess a product's potential future markets.\nThe price of a wrong guess-even if it involves a\ngood-faith effort to assess technical and commercial\nviability-could be large statutory damages (not less\nthan $750 and up to $30,000 per infringed work ). 17\nU.S.C. § 504(c)(1). The additional risk and uncer-\ntainty would mean a consequent additional chill of\ntechnological development.\n\nC\nThe third question-whether a positive copyright\nimpact would outweigh any technology-related loss-I\nfind the most difficult of the three. I do not doubt that a\nmore intrusive Sony test would generally provide\ngreater revenue security for copyright holders. But it is\nharder to conclude that the gains on the copyright\nswings would exceed the losses on the technology\nroundabouts.\n\nFor one thing, the law disfavors equating the two\ndifferent kinds of gain and loss; rather, it leans in favor\nof protecting technology. As Sony itself makes clear,\nthe producer of a technology which permits unlawful\ncopying does not himself engage in unlawful copy-\ning-a fact that makes the attachment of copyright\nliability to the creation, production, or distribution of\nthe technology an exceptional thing. See 464 U.S., at\n431, 104 S.Ct. 774 (courts \"must be circumspect\" in\nconstruing the copyright laws to preclude distribution\nof new technologies). Moreover, Sony has been the\nlaw for some time. And that fact imposes a serious\nburden upon copyright holders like MGM to show a\nneed for change in the current rules of the game, in-\ncluding a more strict interpretation of the test. See, e.g.,\nBrief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording\nCompany Petitioners 31 (Sony should not protect\nproducts when the \"primary or principal\" use is in-\nfringing).\n\nIn any event, the evidence now available does not,\nin my view, make out a sufficiently strong case for\nchange. To say this is not to doubt the basic need to\nprotect copyrighted material from infringement. The\nConstitution itself stresses the vital role that copyright\nplays in advancing the \"useful Arts.\" Art. I, § 8, cl. 8.\nNo one disputes that \"reward to the author or artist\nserves to induce release to the public of the products of\nhis creative genius.\" And deliberate unlawful copying\nis no less an unlawful taking of property than gar-\nden-variety theft. But these highly general principles\ncannot by themselves tell us how to balance the in-\nterests at issue in Sony or whether Sony's standard\nneeds modification. And at certain key points, infor-\nmation is lacking.\n\nWill an unmodified Sony lead to a significant\ndiminution in the amount or quality of creative work\nproduced? Since copyright's basic objective is crea-\ntion and its revenue objectives but a means to that end,\nthis is the underlying copyright question. And its\nanswer is far from clear.\n\nUnauthorized copying likely diminishes industry\nrevenue, though it is not clear by how much. The\nextent to which related production has actually and\nresultingly declined remains uncertain, though there is\ngood reason to believe that the decline, if any, is not\nsubstantial.\n\nMore importantly, copyright holders at least po-\ntentially have other tools available to reduce piracy\nand to abate whatever threat it poses to creative pro-\nduction. As today's opinion makes clear, a copyright\nholder may proceed against a technology provider\nwhere a provable specific intent to infringe (of the\nkind the Court describes) is present.\n\nIn addition, a copyright holder has always had the\nlegal authority to bring a traditional infringement suit\nagainst one who wrongfully copies. Indeed, since\nSeptember 2003, the Recording Industry Association\nof America (RIAA) has filed \"thousands of suits\nagainst people for sharing copyrighted material.\"\nThese suits have provided copyright holders with\ndamages; have served as a teaching tool, making clear\nthat much file sharing, if done without permission, is\nunlawful;and apparently have had a real and signifi-\ncant deterrent effect.\n\nFurther, copyright holders may develop new\ntechnological devices that will help curb unlawful\ninfringement. Some new technology, called \"digital\n'watermarking' \" and \"digital fingerprint[ing],\" can\nencode within the file information about the author\nand the copyright scope and date, which \"fingerprints\"\ncan help to expose infringers. Other technology can,\nthrough encryption, potentially restrict users' ability to\nmake a digital copy.\n\nAt the same time, advances in technology have\ndiscouraged unlawful copying by making lawful cop-\nying (e.g., downloading music with the copyright\nholder's permission) cheaper and easier to achieve.\nSeveral services now sell music for less than $1 per\nsong. (Walmart.com, for example, charges $0.88\neach.) Consequently, many consumers initially at-\ntracted to the convenience and flexibility of services\nlike Grokster are now migrating to lawful paid ser-\nvices (services with copying permission) where they\ncan enjoy at little cost even greater convenience and\nflexibility without engaging in unlawful swapping.\n\nThus, lawful music downloading services-that\ncharge the customer for downloading music and pay\nroyalties to the copyright holder-have continued to\ngrow and to produce substantial revenue. And more\nadvanced types of non-music-oriented peer-to-peer\nnetworks have also started to develop, drawing in part\non the lessons of Grokster.\n\nFinally, as Sony recognized, the legislative option\nremains available. Courts are less well suited than\nCongress to the task of \"accommodat[ing] fully the\nvaried permutations of competing interests that are\ninevitably implicated by such new technology.\" Sony,\n464 U.S., at 431, 104 S.Ct. 774;\n\nI do not know whether these developments and\nsimilar alternatives will prove sufficient, but I am\nreasonably certain that, given their existence, a strong\ndemonstrated need for modifying Sony (or for inter-\npreting Sony's standard more strictly) has not yet been\nshown. That fact, along with the added risks that\nmodification (or strict interpretation) would impose\nupon technological innovation, leads me to the con-\nclusion that we should maintain Sony, reading its\nstandard as I have read it. As so read, it requires af-\nfirmance of the Ninth Circuit's determination of the\nrelevant aspects of the Sony question.\n\n* * *\nFor these reasons, I disagree with Justice\nGINSBURG, but I agree with the Court and join its\nopinion.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.628J / 6.903J Patents, Copyrights, and the Law of Intellectual Property\nSpring 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
