  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nAttendance and Participation\n\nThis is a discussion course in which your attendance and participation in class are vital to your success and that of the group. If you must miss class because of a medical or family emergency, you should notify me beforehand of the fact by phone, email, in person, or a note slipped under my door or in my mailbox - and get the information you missed. More than two unexcused absences may result in failure. Repeated latenesses count as an absence, as does sleeping in class. If you have a conflict, like a recitation, sports commitment, or a job that meets during part of this class, you should not take the class. One more note: I frequently give short factual quizzes at the beginning of class to insure that all students are keeping up with the reading; if you are late, you cannot make up the quiz. Plan to attend every class, having thoroughly read the assigned works.\n\nTutorials\n\nIn order to receive full credit for written work, you will be required to meet the writing tutor assigned to this class before submitting each essay, as well as before the required revision. Failure to do so will result in a drop of a half letter grade for the essay. You will sign up for regular times, generally on Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday afternoons. All of the comments under\nAttendance and Participation\nabove apply equally to tutorials. Come to your tutorials prepared with ideas, questions, drafts, and of course, texts.\n\nWritten Work\n\nYou will write five essays of varying lengths during the semester. I will distribute questions and topics for each assignment; if you prefer to write on a topic of your choice, you\nmust\nget my (or the writing tutor's) OK first. Late essays will be graded down a half grade for every day (not class) they are overdue. I encourage you to rewrite as many essays as you have the time and/or inclination to; you must, however, revise one of your first two essays. All rewrites must be accompanied by the original returned essay and-except for the required one-must be submitted within a week of the original's having been returned to you. Because revisions must do more than incorporate my editorial suggestions, you must include a statement in which you comment on how you attempted to improve the essay.\n\nKeep your essays when I return them to you. At the end of the semester you will hand in a complete portfolio including all of your returned essays, along with a written statement in which you reflect on the changes in your reading and writing abilities during the course of the semester. If you want your final portfolio returned to you, you must provide a self-addressed stamped envelope.\n\nEssays must be typed or word-processed (12 point!), double-spaced (both within and between paragraphs), with proper margins, and the\nmust\nhave page numbers. They should have a carefully considered title and observe the conventions of grammar and spelling.\nProofread\nvery carefully. Read aloud: you'll catch more mistakes if you do.\n\nPapers will be graded on the quality of the ideas and argument, the organization, clarity, and style of writing, and the use of evidence from the text.\n\nFinal note: You will not need to consult any outside works (including published criticism, essays posted on websites,\nCliff Notes\n, old course essays) for these essays and are, in fact, discouraged from doing so. If, however, you do read outside sources, you must cite them in your essay using correct format (refer to the\nMLA Handbook\n). For your convenience, I am including the department's statement on plagiarism.\n\nPlagiarism - use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement-is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution consult the style guides available at\nMIT Online Writing and Communication Center\nand\nMIT Academic Integrity\n.\n\nOral Presentations\n\nEach student will have the opportunity to research a specific historical or literary reference in one of the assigned works and prepare a factual oral presentation of\nno more than five minutes\n. Please see\nassignments\nfor more details.\n\nMonthly Progress Reports\n\nI will distribute monthly progress reports on which I record basic facts: class and tutorial attendance, latenesses, essay grades, rewrites submitted, participation in discussions, and oral presentations.\n\nFinal Grades\n\nI will determine your final grade more or less as follows:\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nWritten work\n\n70%\n\nOral presentation\n\n10%\n\nQuizzes\n\n10%\n\nAttendance, attitude and participation (both class and tutorials)\n\n10%\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroduction\n\n2-4\n\nJane Austen\n\nWorkshop\n\n6-7\n\nSir Walter Scott\n\nEssay 1 due in Ses #6\n\nWorkshop\n\n9-11\n\nMary Shelley\n\nEssay 2 due in Ses #9\n\nRevision due in Ses #12\n\n12-14\n\nHerman Melville\n\n15-16\n\nGustave Flaubert\n\nEssay 3 due in Ses #15\n\n17-19\n\nKate Chopin\n\n20-24\n\nVirginia Woolf\n\nEssay 4 due in Ses #20\n\n25-26\n\nAlistair MacLeod\n\nEssay 5 and final portfolio due in Ses #26",

The\nquestions are designed to help you clarify your thoughts, not to trap you into a rigid\nformat.\n\n1. By the time you sit down to write this essay, we will have devoted quite a lot of class\ndiscussion to the idea of the Bildungsroman--or, as it is often translated, the novel of\neducation, development, or formation. Northanger Abbey is very obviously in this\nnovelistic tradition. By comparing the Catherine Morland we meet at the novel's outset\nwith the Catherine Morland of the final chapters, come up with your own definition of the\nBildungsroman. [Note: Rather than applying a definition to the novel, draw your\ndefinition from the specifics of this particular novel.] [Second note: Bildungsroman is a\nGerman noun and as such it is both italicized and capitalized. Its plural, by the way, is\nBildungsromane.]\n\n2. On the back cover of the Penguin edition of Northanger Abbey we read that\nCatherine Morland \"learns how to tell the difference between books and real life.\"\nCompare an early scene in which she confuses the two with a later one in which she\nclearly distinguishes between them. Then ask yourself why, in her famous \"Defense of\nthe Novel\" (I.5), Austen described the genre as \"only some work in which the greatest\npowers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human\nnature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour\nare conveyed to the world in the best chosen language\" (chapter 5).\n\n3.\n\"Remember the country and the age in which we live.\nRemember that we are English, that we are Christians.\nConsult your own understanding, your own sense of the\nprobable, your own observation of what is passing around\nyou--Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do\nour laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated\nwithout being known, in a country like this, where social and\nCite as: Ina Lipkowitz, course materials for 21L.003-2 Reading Fiction, Fall 2006.

Dearest\nMiss Morland, what idea have you been admitting?\" (172)\n\nMany readers of Northanger Abbey assume that Austen is speaking through\nHenry Tilney, especially in the passage quoted above. Why, though, do readers\nassume that she is less ironic with Tilney than she is with her other characters? How\ndoes she suggest that he reads both Gothic novels and the world in which he lives too\nliterally?\n\n4.\n\n\"I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.\" (118)\n\nThink about Isabella Thorpe's excessive use of language, Mrs. Allen's parrot-like\nuse of language, John Thorpe's hyperbolic use of language, and--most of all--Henry\nTilney and Catherine's bantering dialogue throughout Northanger Abbey. Then ask\nyourself why, at the novel's end, Catherine and Henry are entirely unable to speak.\nWhy does the chapter that brings Henry to Fullerton completely lack the dialogue that\nearlier in the novel characterized the scenes between the two? What might Austen be\nsuggesting about language, deception, and sincerity?\n\nCite as: Ina Lipkowitz, course materials for 21L.003-2 Reading Fiction, Fall 2006.

The questions are\ndesigned to help you clarify your thoughts, not to trap you into a rigid format.\n\n1. In his book The Historical Novel, the Hungarian critic Georg Lukacs wrote that \"Scott's\ngreatness lies in his capacity to give living human embodiment to historical-social types. The\ntypically human terms in which great historical trends become tangible had never before been so\nsuperbly, straightforwardly and poignantly portrayed.\" Think about Hamish and Elspat\nMacTavish in these terms. Consider one or two scenes in which their distinctive characters and\ntheir historically determined personalities are impossible to distinguish. Then, drawing upon\nyour discussion, consider why Scott chose to write historical novels rather than straight history.\n[Note: you might prefer to restrict your discussion to a single character.]\n\n2. One could argue that Oedipus was not responsible for the killing of his father since the oracle\nhad foretold that he would do so. Early in his novella, Scott compares Elspat MacTavish with\nOedipus: \"she was regarded by the Highlanders in the neighbourhood,\" he writes,\nas the Greeks considered those who were pursued by the Furies,\nand endured the mental torment consequent on great criminal\nactions. They regarded such unhappy beings as Orestes and\nOedipus, as being less the voluntary perpetrators of their crimes,\nthan as the passive instruments by which the terrible decress of\nDestiny had been accomplished; and the fear with which they\nbeheld them was not unmingled with veneration. (75)\n\nExamine several scenes in which Elspat is depicted as the \"passive instrument\" not so much of\nDestiny as of History and then consider whether she, like Greek tragic heroes, is the object of not\nonly fear, but also veneration.\n\n3. Consider how Hamish's last gesture and execution are depicted very differently from his\nfather's bloody death. Consider too the narrator's comment that, \"The untamed and angry\npassions which he inherited from father and mother, were awakened by the supposed hostility of\nthose who pursued him; and the restraint under which they were held by his sober judgment,\nbegan gradually to give way\" (109). Is Hamish more like or unlike his father? Is his murder of\nCameron out of character or a revelation of his true character?\n\nCite as: Ina Lipkowitz, course materials for 21L.003-2 Reading Fiction, Fall 2006.

She had been taught to consider those whom\nthey called Saxons, as a race with whom the Gael were constantly\nat war, and she regarded every settlement of theirs within the reach\nof Highland incursion, as affording a legitimate object of attack\nand plunder.

Do you think that the dream Frankenstein has after bringing the Monster to life is\nmore nightmare or wish fulfillment? In order to formulate your response, you will\nwant to consider Shelley's use of the feminine in Frankenstein--both of female\ncharacters and of personified nature. Be sure to refer to specific moments in the\nnovel as you formulate your response. Be sure, too, that your essay doesn't fall into\ntwo insufficiently connected sections.\n\n2. If Mary Shelley intended Frankenstein as a warning against the over-ambitious\npursuit of knowledge, why did she subtitle her novel \"The Modern Prometheus\"?\nYou will probably want to consider the myth(s) of Prometheus and, perhaps, a few of\nthe changes Shelley introduced into the 1831 edition of her novel.\n\n3. Why might Shelley have created such an elaborate frame for her novel Frankenstein?\nCompare Walton's quest to discover the North Pole with Frankenstein's quest to\ncreate life. What motivates them? On what real scientists/discoverers are they based,\nhowever loosely? Do they succeed? Why or why not?\n\n4. Tommo's mysterious leg ailment has long intrigued readers of Typee. Trace its\nprogress throughout the work: when does it begin?, when does it heal?, when does it\nflare up again? Why? What do you think the leg injury might suggest?\n\n5. \"Polynesia could have been the Arctic circle or the Belgian Congo.

He could see the white-\nwashed rocks; the tower, stark and straight; he could see\nthat it was barred with black and white; he could see\nwindows in it; he could even see washing spread on the\nrocks to dry. So that was the Lighthouse, was it?\nNo, the other was also the Lighthouse. For nothing was\nsimply one thing. The other Lighthouse was true too. (186)\n\nAlthough Woolf wrote in a letter that \"directly I'm told what a thing means, it becomes\nhateful to me,\" clearly she used the lighthouse as a central symbol of her work. What\ndoes it mean to six-year-old James? to sixteen-year-old James? to Mrs Ramsay? to\nMr Ramsay? to other characters? How can one image mean so many different things?\n\n3.
