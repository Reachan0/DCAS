  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere are no prerequisites for this course.\n\nCourse Description\n\nProficiency in communicating about science and technology comes from both knowledge and practice, and this course emphasizes both. Through a variety of reading and writing assignments, we will examine general principles of good writing, as well as principles associated specifically with scientific and technical writing. We will also explore the effects of new media as avenues for communicating about science. To help you become more proficient in assessing, revising, and editing your writing, the course emphasizes the importance of the writing process--not just the final product. Class time will involve discussions of scientific articles and essays, as well as small group workshops in which you will offer feedback on each other's writing. Assignments will include, for example, a personal science essay, a science essay for the general public, a research or service project proposal, and a review of a proposal. The topics you write on will generally be of your own choosing, reflecting your background and interests. While the primary emphasis will be on writing, oral communication will also be important in this class. You will have the opportunity to practice oral communication skills by participating in and leading class discussions, as well as through a formal presentation.\n\nTexts\n\nThere are no required textbooks for this course. Required readings will consist of essays and articles that will be posted on the course website.\n\nReading Assignments\n\nComing to class prepared includes completing\nreading assignments\non time. The readings provide important background for the topics we'll be discussing and for the assignments you'll be doing.\n\nGrading\n\nGrading will be according to the following distribution:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nWritten work\n\n20%:\nA Critical Review\n\n5%:\nA Prospectus for a Science Essay\n\n30%:\nA Researched Science Essay for the General Public\n\n15%:\nA Proposal\n\n70%\n\nOral presentation\n\n15%\n\nAttendance; preparation for and participation in class discussions\n\n15%\n\nI do not assign a grade to the first version of the critical review. However, the researched science essay for the general public will receive a grade for both the first version and revision (with greater weight given to the grade for the revision). For the proposal, you will receive a grade on the first version. If you opt to revise the paper, the grade you receive on the revision will replace the grade on the first version. The prospectus will be graded simply as \"check\" (approved) or \"minus\" (not approved). A \"check\" on the first version means you do not need to revise it. You must receive a \"check\" on either the first or revised version before proceeding to work on the science essay. On all papers, MIT students will receive extensive comments and suggestions for revisions from the instructor.\n\nMIT students will also receive both a grade and written comments on the oral presentation of the proposal.",

Thus, these contact calls\nrepresent the most likely means of mother-offspring\nrecogniPon in right whales.\n-\nFrasier, T., Hamilton, P., Brown, M., Kraus, S., & White, B. (2010).

AquaPc Mammals, 36(2), 115-120.\n\nFrom Environmental Science\nOH-PCBs have been detected in the blood and Pssues of humans\n(17-20) and several wildlife species (21-28), and those levels and\npaRerns were shown to vary with species, possibly due to\nspecies-specific metabolic capacity by phase I CYP and/or phase\nII conjugaPon enzymes and binding affinity to TTR (29, 30). Such\ninteresPng observaPons suggest the need for studies on OH-PCB\nresidue levels in biota. However, liRle is known on the paRerns\nand levels of OHPCBs in cetaceans, which accumulate some of\nthe highest concentraPons of PCBs (26, 28, 31-36).\nNomiyama, K; Murata, S; Kunisue, T; Yamada, T; Mizukawa, H; Takahashi, S; Tanabe, S.\nPolychlorinated biphenyls and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs) in the blood\nof toothed and baleen whales stranded along Japanese coastal waters.

Arguments also have been\nmade for pre-contact whale hunPng on the Queen CharloRe\nIslands based on ethnohistoric data and the relaPve abundance\nof whale bone in sites (Acheson and Wigen 2002). However,\nmost researchers working beyond the region where whaling is\nethnographically documented have been reluctant to use such\ninformaPon as evidence for pre-contact whale hunPng.\nLosey, Rober J. and Dongya Y.
