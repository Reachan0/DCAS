The core internals, reactor vessel and fuel\ncanisters conform with the standard geometry of those found in a BWR/5. The oxide fuel\nbundles are nearly identical to the GE 9x9 design used in the current BWR/5 design,\nshown below in Figure PS2-1. The hydride fuel bundles are nearly identical to the oxide\nfuel bundles, except the water rods have been replaced with extra fuel pins, giving a\nuniform 9x9 hydride pin matrix.\n\nFigure PS2-1: Typical GE 9x9 BWR Fuel Bundle\n\nAs well, the BWR/5 core modeling in VIPRE is shown below in Figure PS2-2. This is\nincluded as a reference to give you some feel for how a core may be modeled in VIPRE\nand to help you decipher the output file in answering Question #4.\nPage 1 of 5\nUnless specified otherwise, all figures in this presentation are from:\nShuffler, C., J.

Courtesy of MIT CANES.\nUsed with permission.\n\n9/21/2006\n\nFigure PS2-2: VIPRE Modeling of the BWR/5 Core and Internals\n\nSome important core characteristics of the BWR/5 are:\n\nTable PS2-1: BWR/5 Characteristics\n\nCharacteristic\nValue\nNumber of Assemblies\nNumber of fuel pins per assembly\nHydride - 81 (9x9)\nOxide - 74 (9x9 array geometry with 2\nwater rods)\n\nYou will be finding the maximum power achievable from both the hydride and the oxide\nfueled cores, subject to the given thermal hydraulic limits:\nPage 2 of 5\n\n9/21/2006\n\nTable PS2-2: Thermal Hydraulic Limits\n\nT/H parameter\nLimiting Value\nWhere this value can be found\nin the output files\nMCPR\n1.015\nEnd of outpt.txt\nCore pressure drop\n26.2 psi\nLast line in pd.txt\n(values in this file are in units of psi)\nFuel centerline temperature\nOxide - 2805oC\nHydride - 750oC\nRightmost column in fuelthr.txt\n(values in this file are in units of oF)\nAverage fuel temperature\nOxide - 1400oC\nHydride - N/A\nSecond column from the right in\nfuelthr.txt\n(values in this file are in units of oF)\n\nIMPORTANT: the values in fuelthr.txt are in oF and the limits above are in oC\n\nAs presented in the lecture, there are other thermal hydraulic limits of concern that would\nnormally be used as constraints, e.g. flow velocity. However, in order to keep this\nproblem set manageable, they have been omitted from this analysis.\n\nMECHANICS OF RUNNING VIPRE\n\nThe files that you will need accompany this problem statement in the .zip file that you\ndownloaded from\nHydride_wholecore_input.txt\nOxide_wholecore_input.txt\nvipre.exe\n\nSome important notes about VIPRE:\nVIPRE is a somewhat un-user-friendly program. A stray character in the input\nfile will prevent the program from running properly, so be careful of what you\nchange in the input file.\nVIPRE is FORTRAN application. Everything after a \"*\" in the input file is a\ncomment and is not used in the VIPRE calculations.\nThe input file to execute VIPRE must be called \"input.txt\"\nIn order to run VIPRE, place the executable and the input file in the same folder.\nDouble click on the executable in order to run the program. If in a Windows\nenvironment, you should get a blank DOS screen that will be on your screen for\n<10 seconds (or so) and then will disappear once VIPRE is done calculating\nThe output files will appear in the same folder. The main body of output will\nappear in a file called \"outptt.txt.\" All of the other files are text files with some\nspecialized information.\nVIPRE will not run if there are already output files in the same folder as the input\nfile and the executable. Therefore, in order to run subsequent cases, you must\neither delete or move ALL of the output files from that folder.\n\nMIT\nPage 3 of 5\nMIT server\n\n9/21/2006\nPROBLEM SET\n\nAs an aid to help with the successful completion of this Problem Set, the\nfollowing paper has been included in the zip file with the rest of the necessary files:\n\nP. Ferroni et al, \"Feasibility of Improving BWR Performance Using Hydride\nFuel,\" Proceedings of ICAPP '06, Reno, NV USA, June 4-8, 2006, Paper 6241.\n\n1. (10 points) Keeping the power to flow (P/F) ratio the same, change the pin power (and\nthe flow to correspond to the P/F ratio of 110.486 kW/lbm/sec) to find the maximum\nachievable core power, while still respecting the thermal hydraulic limits of Table PS2-2.\nChange the name of the VIPRE input file called \"Hydride_wholecore_input.txt\"\nto \"input.txt\"\nFind the line with \"oper.5\" in the comments at the end of the line\nAdjust the power and flow as necessary to increase or decrease power while\nkeeping the P/F ratio constant, respecting the thermal hydraulic limits listed in\nTable PS2-2. IMPORTANT: the power listed in oper.5 is the power of the\naverage fuel rod (kW/rod) and the flow listed in oper.5 is the core flow (lbm/sec)\nfor a 1/8th section (i.e. total core flow*(1/8)). The P/F ratio above is the ratio of\ntotal core power to total core flow.\na. Record the core power, calculated from the pin power in oper.5 that gives you the\nmaximum power while staying within the prescribed thermal hydraulic limits.\nb. Repeat this process for the \"Oxide_wholecore_input.txt\" input file. Note that the\n1/8th core flow to be entered as an input in oper.5 (for the oxide fueled case\nONLY) must be equal to 96% of the 1/8th core flow obtained from the calculation\nof flow using the selected rod power and given P/F ratio. This is to account for\nthe roughly 4% of flow that would normally go through the water rods, but is\nunable to be modeled explicitly in VIPRE.\n\n2. (30 points @ 5 points for each part) Compare the results between the hydride and\noxide fueled cores and answer the following questions:\na. Explain the thermal hydraulic differences between the hydride and oxide cores.\nFor each case, which thermal hydraulic limits are approached? Justify why each\nof the limits should have or should not have been approached for both the hydride\nand oxide fueled cases.\nb. Explain fundamentally why a higher power is achievable for the hydride fueled\nstrategy.\nc. Explain why the P/F ratio is kept constant in this exercise. (HINT: you may\njustify your answer using simple calculations, formulae, or hand-drawn plots, if\nyou prefer.)\nd. Discuss the reactor physics differences between the two fuel strategies. What\nneutronic limits would you expect to come up against?\ne. Do the values for exit quality make sense? (HINT: search for the section called\n\"channel exit summary\" in the outpt.txt file) As designers, why should we be\nconcerned with exit quality?\nPage 4 of 5\n\n9/21/2006\nf. What other engineering design concerns would you have with the proposed\nhydride fuel strategy? (HINT: Table PS2-3 may serve as a good starting point for\nanswering this question)\n\nTable PS2-3: Comparison of Hydride and Oxide Fuel Properties\n\nProperty\nU(45%w/o)-ZrH1.6\nUO2\nHyd/Ox\nDensity (kg/m3)\n0.75\nU density (kg/m3)\n0.38\nH/U ratio in the fuel\n-\nMelting T (oC)\nAfter releasing H2,\nthe remaining matrix\n(U+Zr) melts\nbetween 1135 and\n1855 oC\n-\nTh.conductivity (W/m\nK)\n17.6\n(~T independent)\n2.8\n(@ 1250oC)\n6.3\nSpecific heat (J/kg K)\n~331\n(@ 550oC)\n(@ 1250oC)\n~1\nTh.expansion (ÎL/L) (%)\n~1\n(@ 550oC)\n1.3\n(@ 1250oC)\n~0.8\nSwelling\nLarger than UO2\n-\n-\nCold fuel-clad gap\nth.conductivity (W/m K)\n(Liq.

Propose\nsolutions for how to exploit this margin and discuss the pros/cons of each.\n\n4. (10 points - 3 new ways VIPRE could be useful for full credit) Open the file\n\"outpt.txt\" and spend a few minutes looking at the output data in an effort to understand\nwhat kind of data can be obtained from VIPRE. List 3 ways in which VIPRE could be\nuseful in examining thermal hydraulic limits other than those specifically addressed in\nthis problem set.\n\nExample answer (using a thermal hydraulic limit that IS addressed in this problem set):\n\nFuel temperatures - VIPRE gives an output of fuel temperatures. This could be useful\nin assessing fuel performance phenomena associated with fuel temperatures.\n\nQuestions about this problem set can be directed to either the grader for this course, Chris\nHandwerk or Paolo Ferroni.\nPage 5 of 5"

Background\nStorage of spent fuel can be done safely in a water filled spent fuel pool under\n10 CFR Part 50, a transportation package under 10 CFR Part 71, or a dry storage cask under\n10 CFR Part 72. The primary technical challenges involve removing the heat generated by the\nspent fuel (decay heat), storing the fuel in an arrangement that avoids an accidental criticality,\nand providing radiation shielding. Removing the decay heat keeps the spent fuel from\nbecoming damaged due to excessive heatup. Transportation packages and dry storage casks\n-3\n\nare designed to be capable of removing the decay heat generated by the fuel when filled with\nwater or when dry without the need for active heat removal systems. Avoiding an accidental\ncriticality is important to preclude the possibility of overheating the spent fuel and damaging the\nfuel. When dry, transportation packages and dry storage casks are subcritical by the absence\nof water as a neutron moderator, as well as by geometric design, and through the use of\nneutron poison materials such as boral and poison plates. When the packages and casks are\nflooded with water, they may also rely on soluble boron to maintain the subcritical condition.\nTherefore, a boron dilution event is the scenario that could result in an accidental criticality with\nthe possibility of excessive fuel temperature and subsequent fuel damage. Radiation shielding,\nprovided by the water in a spent fuel pool or the container material in a transportation package\nor dry storage cask, is important to protect people that may be near the spent fuel from\nunacceptable exposure to radiation. The NRC has promulgated regulations governing the\ncapability of both spent fuel pools (10 CFR Parts 50 and 70), dry storage casks\n(10 CFR Part 72) and transportation packages (10 CFR Part 71) to address these technical\nchallenges for the protection of public health and safety.\n10 CFR 50.68 requires that spent fuel pools remain subcritical in an unborated,\nmaximum moderation condition. This regulation also allows credit for the operating history of\nthe fuel (fuel burnup) when analyzing the storage configuration of the spent fuel.\n10 CFR Parts 71 and 72 approve the use of spent fuel transportation packages and storage\ncasks, respectively. 10 CFR Part 71 requires that transportation packages be designed\nassuming they can be flooded with fresh water (unborated), and thus are already analyzed in a\nmanner that complies with the 10 CFR 50.68 assumption. However, 10 CFR Part 72 was, in\npart, predicated on the assumption that spent fuel (without any burnup) would remain subcritical\nwhen stored dry in a cask and remain subcritical when placed in a cask in a spent fuel pool at a\n-4\n\ncommercial power reactor. Implementation of 10 CFR Part 72 relies on soluble boron, rather\nthan on burnup, to assure subcriticality when the fuel is in a cask in a spent fuel pool.\nOn March 23, 2005, the NRC issued Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2005-05\naddressing spent fuel criticality analyses for spent fuel pools under 10 CFR 50.68 and\nIndependent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) under 10 CFR Part 72. The intent of the\nRIS was to advise reactor licensees that they must meet both the requirements of 10 CFR 50.68\nand 10 CFR Part 72 with respect to subcriticality during storage cask loading in spent fuel pools.\nThe need to meet both regulations and the differences in the assumptions described above\ncreate an additional burden on licensees to show that credit for soluble boron is not required to\npreclude an accidental criticality in a water-filled, high-density dry storage cask used for storing\nfuel. In order to satisfy both of these requirements, a site-specific analysis that demonstrates\nthat the casks would remain subcritical for the specific irradiated fuel loading planned, without\ncredit for soluble boron, as described in 10 CFR 50.68 is required. This analysis relies on the\nfuel burnup to determine the margin to criticality for the specific cask loading. The analysis is\nsimilar to that conducted for the spent fuel pool itself, but takes into account the unique design\nfeatures of the cask when determining the minimum burnup required for spent fuel storage in\nthe specific cask. This issue only applies to pressurized water reactors (PWR) because boiling\nwater reactor (BWR) spent fuel pools do not contain soluble boron and the casks that are used\nto load BWR fuel do not rely on soluble boron to maintain subcriticality.\nThe regulations, as currently written, create an unnecessary burden for both industry\nand the NRC, of performing two different analyses with two different sets of assumptions for the\npurpose of preventing a criticality accident, with no associated safety benefit. This burden is\nconsidered unnecessary because the conditions which could dilute the boron concentration\nwithin a transportation package or dry storage cask (hereinafter \"package or cask\") in a spent\nfuel pool, and cause fuel damage with the release of radioactive material, are highly unlikely.\n-5\n\nThe NRC evaluated the two scenarios in which a boron dilution could occur: (1) a rapid drain\ndown and subsequent reflood of the spent fuel pool, or (2) a slow boron dilution of the spent fuel\npool. The result of the NRC evaluation is that the possibility of each scenario is highly unlikely\n(see Appendix A for additional details). Therefore, there is no safety benefit from requiring the\nlicensee to conduct a site specific analysis to comply with 10 CFR 50.68(b) while fuel is within a\npackage or cask in a spent fuel pool.\nAs a result, a revision to the Commission's regulations is necessary to eliminate the\nrequirement for separate criticality analyses using different methodologies and acceptance\ncriteria for fuel within a package or cask in a spent fuel pool. This direct final rule will eliminate\nthe criticality control requirements in Â§ 50.68 if fuel is within a package or cask in a spent fuel\npool. Instead, the criticality requirements of 10 CFR Parts 71 and 72, as applicable, would\napply to fuel within packages and casks in a spent fuel pool. For fuel in the spent fuel pool but\noutside the package or cask, the criticality requirements of 10 CFR 50.68 would apply.\nII. Section-by-Section Analysis of Substantive Changes\nSection 50.68 -- Criticality accident requirements.\nSection 50.68 describes the requirements for maintaining subcriticality of fuel\nassemblies in the spent fuel pool. New paragraph (c) of this section states that the criticality\naccident requirements of 10 CFR 50.68(b) do not apply to fuel within a package or cask in a\nspent fuel pool. Rather, the criticality accident requirements of 10 CFR Part 71 or 72, as\napplicable, apply to fuel within a package or cask in a spent fuel pool. This new paragraph\nprovides the regulatory boundary between Â§ 50.68(b) and 10 CFR Part 71 or 72 for performing\ncriticality analyses. A licensee moving fuel between the spent fuel pool and a package or cask\nneed only analyze fuel within the package or cask according to 10 CFR Part 71 or 72, as\n-6\n\napplicable, and is not required to analyze fuel within the package or cask using Â§ 50.68(b)\nrequirements.\nFor the purpose of this paragraph, any package or cask that is in contact with the water\nin a spent fuel pool is considered \"in\" the spent fuel pool. Also, once any portion of the fuel (fuel\nassembly, fuel bundle, fuel pin, or other device containing fuel) enters the physical boundary of\nthe package or cask, that fuel is considered \"within\" that package or cask. When a package or\ncask is in a spent fuel pool, the criticality requirements of 10 CFR Part 71 or 72, as applicable,\nand the requirements of the Certificate of Compliance for that package or cask, apply to the fuel\nwithin that package or cask. Criticality analysis for the fuel in that package or cask in\naccordance with Â§ 50.68(b) is not required. For fuel in the spent fuel pool and not within a\npackage or cask, the criticality requirements of Â§ 50.68(b) apply.\nIII. Procedural Background\nThe NRC is using the \"direct final rule procedure\" to issue this amendment because it is\nnot expected to be controversial. The amendment to the rule will become effective on [INSERT\nDATE 75 DAYS AFTER PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]. However, if the NRC\nreceives significant adverse comments by [INSERT DATE 30 DAYS AFTER PUBLICATION IN\nTHE FEDERAL REGISTER], then the NRC will publish a document that withdraws this action.\nIn that event, the comments received in response to this amendment would then be considered\nas comments on the companion proposed rule published elsewhere in this Federal Register,\nand the comments will be addressed in a later final rule based on that proposed rule. Unless\nthe modifications to the proposed rule are significant enough to require that it be republished as\na proposed rule, the NRC will not initiate a second comment period on this action.\n-7\n\nA significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter explains why the\nrule would be inappropriate, including challenges to the rule's underlying premise or approach,\nor would be ineffective or unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and\nsignificant if:\n(1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient to require a\nsubstantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For example, a substantive response\nis required when:\n(a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its position or conduct\nadditional analysis;\n(b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a substantive response to\nclarify or complete the record; or\n(c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously addressed or\nconsidered by the NRC.\n(2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and it is apparent that\nthe rule would be ineffective or unacceptable without incorporation of the change or addition.\n(3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than editorial) to the rule.\nIV. Voluntary Consensus Standards\nThe National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-113)\nrequires that Federal agencies use technical standards that are developed or adopted by\nvoluntary consensus standards bodies unless the use of such a standard is inconsistent with\napplicable law or otherwise impractical. This direct final rule eliminates duplication of criticality\n-8\n\ncontrol requirements for fuel within a package or cask in the spent fuel pool. These packages\nand casks have separate requirements for criticality control during loading, storage and\nunloading operations. This rulemaking does not involve the establishment or use of technical\nstandards, and hence this act does not apply to this direct final rule.\nV. Agreement State Compatibility\nUnder the \"Policy Statement on Adequacy and Compatibility of Agreement State\nPrograms\" approved by the NRC on June 30, 1997, and published in the Federal Register on\nSeptember 3, 1997 (62 FR 46517), this rule is classified as Compatibility Category \"NRC.\"\nCompatibility is not required for Category \"NRC\" regulations. The NRC program elements in\nthis category are those that relate directly to areas of regulation reserved to the NRC by the\nAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA), or the provisions of Title 10 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations. Although an Agreement State may not adopt program elements reserved\nto NRC, it may wish to inform its licensees of certain requirements via a mechanism that is\nconsistent with the particular State's administrative procedure laws but does not confer\nregulatory authority on the State.\nVI. Plain Language\nThe Presidential Memorandum dated June 1, 1998, entitled \"Plain Language in\nGovernment Writing,\" directed that the Government's writing be in plain language. The NRC\nrequests comments on this direct final rule specifically with respect to the clarity and\neffectiveness of the language used. Comments should be sent to the address listed under the\nheading \"ADDRESSES\" above.\n-9\n\nVII. Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Environmental Assessment\nThe NRC has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as\namended, and the NRC's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this rule is not a\nmajor Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and, therefore,\nan environmental impact statement is not required. The basis for this determination is set forth\nbelow.\nThis direct final rule eliminates duplication of criticality control requirements for fuel\nwithin a package or cask in the spent fuel pool. These packages and casks are required to\nmeet the licensing requirements, defined in 10 CFR Part 71 or 72, as applicable, and the\napplicable Certificate of Compliance (CoC), which currently provide criticality control\nrequirements for fuel loading, storage and unloading. This rulemaking will preclude the\nnecessity for nuclear power plant licensees to meet the criticality control requirements for both\nregulations (for 10 CFR Part 50 and for 10 CFR Part 71 or 72) while fuel is within a package or\ncask in a spent fuel pool. The regulations in 10 CFR Parts 71 and 72, as applicable, coupled\nwith the package or cask CoC, provide adequate assurance that there are no inadvertent\ncriticality events while fuel is within a package or cask in a spent fuel pool. Experience over 20\nyears has demonstrated that the regulations in 10 CFR Parts 71 and 72 have been effective in\npreventing inadvertent criticality events, and the NRC concludes that as a matter of regulatory\nefficiency, there is no purpose to requiring licensees to apply for and obtain exemptions from\nrequirements of Â§ 50.68(b) if they adhere to the regulations in 10 CFR Part 71 or 72 as\napplicable. Since the regulations in 10 CFR Parts 71 and 72 and the CoC provide safe and\neffective methods for preventing inadvertent criticality events in nuclear power plants, the NRC\nconcludes that this direct final rule will not have any significant impact on the quality of the\n-10\n\nhuman environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement has not been prepared for\nthis direct final rule.\nThe foregoing constitutes the environmental assessment for this direct final rule.\nVIII. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement\nThis direct final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection\nrequirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing\nrequirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, Approval\nNumber 3150-0011, 3150-0008 and 3150-0132.\nIX. Public Protection Notification\nThe NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a\nrequest for information or an information collection requirement unless the requesting document\ndisplays a currently valid OMB control number.\nX. Regulatory Analysis\nStatement of the problem and objectives\nAs described in the Background section of this document, the need to meet the criticality\naccident requirements of 10 CFR 50.68 and of 10 CFR Part 71 or 72, and the differences in\ntheir assumptions, create an additional burden on licensees to show that credit for soluble boron\nis not required to preclude an accidental criticality in a water-filled package for transporting fuel\nor a water-filled, high-density dry storage cask used for storing fuel. In order to satisfy both of\n-11\n\nthese requirements, a site-specific analysis that demonstrates that the fuel in the package or\ncask would remain subcritical for the specific irradiated fuel loading planned, without credit for\nsoluble boron, would be required. In the Â§ 50.68 analysis, the licensee would rely on the fuel\nburnup to determine the margin to criticality for the specific package or cask loading. The Â§\n50.68 analysis would be similar to that conducted for the spent fuel pool itself, but would take\ninto account the unique design features of the package or cask when determining the minimum\nburnup required for spent fuel storage in the specific package or cask. This issue only applies\nto PWRs because BWR spent fuel pools do not contain soluble boron and the packages and\ncasks that are used to load BWR fuel do not rely on soluble boron to maintain subcriticality. As\ncurrently written, these regulations create an unnecessary burden for both industry and the NRC\nwith no associated safety benefit.\nThe objective of this rulemaking activity is to revise 10 CFR 50.68 to eliminate the\nrequirement for redundant criticality analyses for fuel within a package or cask in a spent fuel\npool. As a result, any fuel that is in the spent fuel pool and not within the physical boundary of a\npackage or cask remains subject to the criticality requirements of Â§ 50.68. Once the fuel enters\nthe physical boundary of the package or cask, it is then subject to the criticality requirements of\n10 CFR Part 71 or 72, as applicable, and no longer subject to the criticality requirements of Â§\n50.68.\nAlternative approaches and their values and impacts\nAnother option to this amendment is for the NRC to make no changes and allow the\nlicensees to continue requesting exemptions. If no changes are made, the licensees will\ncontinue to incur the costs of submitting exemptions (approximately $300k) and NRC will incur\nthe costs of reviewing them (approximately $150k). Under this rule, an easing of the burden on\nlicensees results from not having to request exemptions. Similarly, the NRC's burden will be\nreduced by avoiding the need to review and evaluate these exemption requests. Another\n-12\n\ndownfall to this option is that licensees may not apply 10 CFR 50.59 to exemptions, instead\nnecessitating a new exemption for future modifications to package or cask design.\nFurthermore, licensees would not be in compliance with existing regulations, and that the NRC\nwould then be regulating by exemption rather than by rule.\nA final option is for the NRC to make no change and licensees to request a license\namendment to add a Technical Specification which restricts the burnup of spent fuel assemblies\nloaded into the package or cask. This license amendment would only be required once, putting\nthe licensee into compliance with NRC regulations, and would then permit licensees to make\nmodifications using 10 CFR 50.59. However, the burden of producing and approving an\namendment on both the licensee (approximately $300k) and the NRC (approximately $100k) is\nquite significant, with no safety benefit.\nDecision rationale for the selected regulatory action\nBased on the evaluation of values and impacts of the alternative approaches, the NRC\nhas decided to revise 10 CFR 50.68 to eliminate the requirement for licensees to perform a\nseparate criticality analysis based on the requirements of 10 CFR 50.68 for fuel within a\npackage or cask in a spent fuel pool. This rule is not a mandatory requirement, but an easing of\nburden action, which results in increased regulatory efficiency. The rule does not impose any\nadditional costs on existing licensees and has no negative impact on public health and safety.\nThe rule will provide savings to licensees that transfer fuel from the spent fuel pool to a dry\nstorage cask or transportation package. There will also be savings in resources to the NRC as\nwell.\n-13\n\nXI. Regulatory Flexibility Certification\nUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the NRC certifies that this\nrule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This\ndirect final rule affects only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants. The companies\nthat own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of \"small entities\" set forth in\nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business Size Standards set out in regulations issued\nby the Small Business Administration at 10 CFR 2.810.\nXII. Backfit Analysis\nThe NRC has determined that the backfit rule does not apply to this direct final rule\nbecause this amendment does not involve any provisions that would impose backfits as defined\nin 10 CFR 50.109. Reactor licensees are currently required to meet both the requirements of\n10 CFR 50.68 and 10 CFR Part 71 or 72, as applicable, with respect to subcriticality during\npackage or cask loading or unloading in spent fuel pools. The need to meet both regulations\ncreates an additional burden on licensees to show that credit for soluble boron is not required to\npreclude an accidental criticality in a package or cask when filled with water. In order to satisfy\nboth of these requirements, a site specific analysis that demonstrates that the fuel in the\npackage or cask would remain subcritical for the specific irradiated fuel loading planned, without\ncredit for boron, would be required. This action amends 10 CFR 50.68 so that the criticality\naccident requirements for spent fuel pool storage racks do not apply to the fuel within a package\nor cask in a spent fuel pool. Licensees may voluntarily decide not to perform an analysis\ndemonstrating that the criticality requirements in Â§ 50.68 are met for fuel within a package under\n-14\n\n10 CFR Part 71 or a cask under 10 CFR Part 72. Therefore, the proposed rule constitutes a\nvoluntary relaxation, and a backfit analysis is not required.\nXIII. Congressional Review Act\nIn accordance with the Congressional Review Act of 1996, the NRC has determined that\nthis action is not a major rule and has verified this determination with the Office of Information\nand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget.\nList of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 50\nAntitrust, Classified information, Criminal penalties, Fire protection, Intergovernmental\nrelations, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Radiation protection, Reactor siting criteria,\nReporting and recordkeeping requirements.\nFor the reasons set forth in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy\nAct of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and 5 U.S.C.\n552 and 553, the NRC is adopting the following amendments to 10 CFR Part 50.\nPART 50 -- DOMESTIC LICENSING OF PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION FACILITIES\n1.

Reyes,\nExecutive Director for Operations.\n-17\n\nAPPENDIX A: TECHNICAL BASIS DOCUMENT FOR RIN 3150-AH95 (RN 678)\nI. Background:\nIn the production of electricity from commercial power reactors, spent fuel that is\ngenerated needs to be stored and safely managed. As part of the design of all commercial\npower reactors, spent fuel storage pools (SFP) were included to provide for the safe storage of\nspent fuel for a number of years. For many years there was sufficient room in the original spent\nfuel pools to continually store spent fuel without space restrictions being an immediate concern.\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, when the spent fuel pools currently in use were designed and built, it\nwas anticipated that the spent fuel would be moved off the reactor site for further processing\nand/or permanent disposal. The planned long-term approach is for disposal of this spent fuel in\na permanent geological repository.\nAs delays were encountered with the development of the permanent geological disposal\nsite, the spent fuel pools began to fill up and space restrictions became a concern. Since the\nmid 1980's licensees, with NRC approval, have increased the storage capacity of the spent fuel\npools by changing the designs of the storage racks to allow the fuel to be safely stored closer\ntogether. This was recognized as a short term solution, with the assumption that permanent\ndisposal would be made available within a reasonable period. As additional delays were\nencountered with the permanent geological disposal of the spent fuel, the nuclear power\nindustry, in conjunction with the NRC, developed alternative storage solutions, including storing\nthe spent fuel in dry storage casks on their sites.\nMaintaining the capacity to store spent fuel in a spent fuel pool is important for safety.\nBeing able to store the spent fuel in a water filled spent fuel pool allows the fuel that is removed\nfrom the reactor core at the start of a refueling outage to be safely cooled at the time it is\ngenerating the greatest decay heat. Also, the water provides shielding for the workers involved\nA-1\n\nin conducting maintenance on the various systems and components necessary to safely\noperate the reactor. During a refueling outage inspection and maintenance activities need to\nbe performed on the systems and components that would normally protect the fuel from\ndamage as a result of the operation of the reactor. These inspections and maintenance\nactivities can be accomplished more effectively and efficiently by draining the water from the\nreactor coolant and other supporting systems. Placing the fuel assemblies in the spent fuel pool\nduring this period allows the reactor coolant and other systems to be drained while keeping the\nspent fuel safe (covered with water). Therefore, it is important to maintain the capability to\ncompletely remove all of the fuel assemblies from the reactor vessel during a refueling outage\n(full core offload capability). From an operational perspective, additional capacity should be\nmaintained to accommodate a full core offload as well as the storage of new fuel that replaces\nthe spent fuel permanently removed from the reactor core.\nStorage of spent fuel can be done safely in a water filled spent fuel pool under\n10 CFR Part 50, a transportation package under 10 CFR Part 71, or a dry storage cask under\n10 CFR Part 72. The primary technical challenges involve removing the heat generated by the\nspent fuel (decay heat), storing the fuel in an arrangement that avoids an accidental criticality,\nand providing radiation shielding. Removing the decay heat keeps the spent fuel from\nbecoming damaged due to excessive heatup. Dry storage casks are designed to be capable of\nremoving the decay heat generated by the fuel when filled with water or when dry without the\nneed for active heat removal systems. Avoiding an accidental criticality is important to preclude\nthe possibility of overheating the spent fuel and damaging the fuel. When dry, casks are\nsubcritical by the absence of water as a neutron moderator, as well as by geometric design, and\nthrough the use of neutron poison materials such as boral and poison plates. When the casks\nare flooded with water, they may also rely on soluble boron to maintain the subcritical condition.\nTherefore, a boron dilution event is the scenario that could result in an accidental criticality with\nA-2\n\nthe possibility of excessive fuel temperature and subsequent fuel damage. Radiation shielding,\nprovided by the water in a spent fuel pool or the container material in a dry storage cask, is\nimportant to protect people that may be near the spent fuel from unacceptable exposure to\nradiation. The NRC has promulgated regulations governing the capability of both spent fuel\npools (10 CFR Parts 50 and 70), dry storage casks (10 CFR Part 72) and transportation\npackages (10 CFR Part 71) to address these technical challenges for the protection of public\nhealth and safety.\nSince the original design of commercial reactors included spent fuel pools, the spent fuel\nis stored in these pools when it initially comes out of the reactor. Decay heat from this spent\nfuel is primarily produced by the radioactive decay of fission products generated during the\nperiod the fuel is in the reactor core. As the fission products decay, the amount of decay heat\ngenerated in the spent fuel also decreases. So, over time the spent fuel becomes cooler,\nrequiring less heat removal capability. Since the decay heat is higher when the spent fuel is\nremoved from the reactor, it is more efficient to cool the fuel in a spent fuel pool where the fuel\nis surrounded by water. This allows the heat to be transferred to the water in the pool. The\nspent fuel pool requires a dedicated cooling system to maintain the temperature of the water in\nthe pool cool enough to prevent the water from boiling. The spent fuel is allowed to cool down\nin the spent fuel pool for several years before it is placed in a dry cask storage cask or\ntransportation package. When placed in a dry storage cask or transportation package, the\namount of heat generated by the spent fuel is low enough that the fuel can be cooled by the gas\nsurrounding the fuel with the heat being transferred through the cask or package to the\nsurrounding air. Once placed in the dry storage cask or transportation package, the fuel will\nremain cool enough to prevent fuel damage without the need for an auxiliary cooling system.\nSpent fuel pools, dry storage casks and transportation packages are designed to\npreclude an accidental criticality primarily by relying on the geometrical configuration of how the\nA-3\n\nspent fuel is stored. Both wet and dry storage rely on material that absorbs the neutrons\nnecessary for the fission process to occur (fixed neutron poisons, such as boral, poison plates,\netc.). This material is inserted when building the storage racks or when building the\ncask/package. This material is integral to the storage racks in the spent fuel pool and in the\ncask/package used to physically hold the spent fuel in place. This establishes the geometrical\nconfiguration of the how the spent fuel is stored. Criticality is of a greater concern when the fuel\nis stored in a spent fuel pool because the water used to cool the fuel is also a very effective\nmoderator that facilitates the nuclear fission process. In dry storage, the spent fuel is\nsurrounded by a gas that does not act as a moderator, therefore, criticality is a significantly\nsmaller concern and the spent fuel can be safely stored closer together than in a spent fuel\npool.\nTransfer of the spent fuel from the spent fuel pool to the cask/package is performed\nwhile the cask/package is submerged in the spent fuel pool. When the cask/package is in the\nspent fuel pool, the fuel stored in the cask/package is surrounded by water, making an\naccidental criticality a concern. To preclude an accidental criticality in this circumstance, other\nphysical processes or systems are used, primarily by putting a neutron poison (boron) in the\nwater. Before any spent fuel is placed in either a spent fuel pool or a cask/package, a detailed\nanalysis is conducted that demonstrates that the geometrical configuration and other physical\nsystems or processes provide reasonable assurance that an accidental criticality will be\nprevented.\nIt is also possible that the spent fuel would need to be transferred out of a dry storage\ncask and back in to the spent fuel pool. This might arise in one of two situations. The first\nsituation is that it might be necessary to inspect the spent fuel or the dry storage cask itself.\nThis would necessitate transferring some or all of the spent fuel in the dry storage cask back\ninto the spent fuel pool. The second and more probable situation that would require unloading\nA-4\n\nthe spent fuel from the dry storage cask back into the spent fuel pool, would be in preparation\nfor shipment of the spent fuel. Before the spent fuel in a dry storage cask licensed pursuant to\n10 CFR Part 72 only (not also licensed pursuant to 10 CFR Part 71) can be shipped, it must first\nbe transferred to an approved transportation package licensed pursuant to 10 CFR Part 71. In\norder to place the spent fuel into the transportation package, it must first be unloaded from the\ndry storage cask back into the spent fuel pool. The dry storage cask is then removed from the\nspent fuel pool and is replaced by the transportation package. The spent fuel is then loaded\ninto the transportation package.\nAs described in more detail below, there are sufficient regulatory controls in place to\nprovide reasonable assurance that spent fuel can be safely stored both in spent fuel pools and\nin dry storage casks or transportation packages. The purpose for the change to 10 CFR 50.68\nis to reduce the regulatory burden imposed on licensees by removing a requirement for an\nunnecessary criticality analysis. This change clarifies that, when loading spent fuel into a dry\nstorage cask or transportation package while in the spent fuel pool, the license requirements\nand controls (including the physical processes and systems) relied on by the NRC in its\ndetermination that a specific dry storage cask or transportation package is acceptable shall be\nfollowed and provide the basis for the NRC concluding that public health and safety are\nmaintained.\nII. Regulatory Evaluation:\nThe regulation at 10 CFR 50.68 requires that pressurized water reactor (PWR) SFPs\nremain subcritical in an unborated, maximum moderation condition. To demonstrate that the\nfuel in the SFP remains subcritical in this condition, 10 CFR 50.68 allows credit for the operating\nhistory of the fuel (fuel burnup) when analyzing the storage configuration of the spent fuel.\nTaking the burnup of the spent fuel into consideration reduces the reactivity of the fuel and\nA-5\n\nreduces the need for soluble boron to demonstrate subcriticality. Meeting the unborated\ncondition requirement provides reasonable assurance that potential boron dilution events that\ncould occur during the storage period of spent fuel in the SFP would not result in an accidental\ncriticality. Boron dilution events could occur due to leakage from the spent fuel pool requiring\nreplenishment from an unborated water source. For example, a SFP liner rupture due to an\nearthquake could result in a rapid drain down of the SFP as could a rupture of the SFP cooling\nsystem. Dilution could also result from the introduction of unborated water in the vicinity of the\nSFP, such as from a fire suppression system. For the rapid drain down scenario, the SFP might\nbe replenished with unborated sources of water in an effort to quickly reestablish spent fuel\ncooling and to provide shielding. It is necessary to reestablish spent fuel cooling during a rapid\ndrain down event to preclude the possibility of the elevated cladding temperature that could\ncause overheating of the fuel and a loss of fuel cladding integrity. Because of the very low\nlikelihood of a rapid drain down event, it is not considered part of the licensing basis for\ncommercial nuclear power reactors.\nStorage casks are approved for use by the NRC by the issuance of specific and general\nlicenses pursuant to 10 CFR Part 72. Transportation packages for spent fuel are licensed\npursuant to 10 CFR Part 71. 10 CFR Part 71 currently requires that the criticality safety system\nfor transportation packages be designed with the assumption that a package can be flooded\nwith fresh water (i.e., no soluble boron). Therefore, the transportation packages are already\nanalyzed in a manner that complies with the 10 CFR 50.68 assumption. The following\ndiscussions will then focus only on storage casks. However, the transportation packages are\nincluded in the proposed change in order to allow loading/unloading operation of a\ntransportation package into a 10 CFR Part 50 facility (i.e., spent fuel pool) without the need for a\nspecific license or exemption considerations under 10 CFR Part 50.\nA-6\n\nThe certificates and licenses issued by the NRC for these storage casks and the\nrequirements of 10 CFR Part 72 include controls for fuel loading, storage, and unloading that\nprovide reasonable assurance that spent fuel cooling is maintained and an accidental criticality\nis avoided. These controls are not identical to the requirements contained in 10 CFR 50.68, but\ninstead allow for an alternate means of assuring safety by providing additional requirements that\nare not present in 10 CFR 50.68. NRC approval of the storage cask designs was, in part,\npredicated on the assumption that unirradiated commercial nuclear fuel (fresh fuel) of no more\nthan 5 weight percent enrichment would remain subcritical when stored in its dry configuration\nand that it would remain subcritical with a sufficient boron concentration (if any boron was\nrequired) when stored in a water filled configuration, such as when it is in a SFP at a\ncommercial power reactor. Under 10 CFR Part 72, reliance is placed on soluble boron to\nassure subcriticality when the cask is full of water, rather than relying on fuel burnup. The fresh\nfuel assumption allowed the NRC to generically approve storage casks without regard to the\noperating history of the fuel from a criticality perspective by establishing a bounding case for the\nvarious fuel types that could be stored in the approved storage casks. If generic fuel burnup\ndata were available, the NRC may have been able to approve storage cask designs without the\nneed for boron to assure subcriticality, but would have put in place a minimum fuel burnup\nrequirement instead. By having the 10 CFR Part 72 controls in place, loading, storage, and\nunloading of spent fuel can be accomplished in a manner that precludes an accidental criticality\nwhile maintaining sufficient fuel cooling capabilities.\nIII. Problem Statement:\nOn March 23, 2005, the NRC issued Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2005-05\naddressing spent fuel criticality analyses for SFPs under 10 CFR 50.68 and Independent Spent\nFuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) under 10 CFR Part 72. The intent of the RIS was to advise\nA-7\n\nreactor licensees that they must meet both the requirements of 10 CFR 50.68 and 10 CFR\nPart 72 with respect to subcriticality during storage cask loading in SFPs. Different assumptions\nare relied on under these regulations to achieve the same underlying purpose, namely to place\nspent fuel in a condition such that it remains cooled and to preclude an accidental criticality.\nThe need to meet both regulations and the differences in the assumptions creates an\nadditional burden on licensees to show that credit for boron is not required to preclude an\naccidental criticality in a storage cask when filled with water. This condition exists for NRC\napproved high density storage casks used for storing PWR fuel. As permitted under\n10 CFR Part 72, boron can be relied on at PWR SFPs to maintain subcriticality during storage\ncask loading or unloading. However, 10 CFR 50.68 requires that spent fuel assemblies be\nsubcritical with unborated water in SFPs. In order to satisfy both of these requirements, a site\nspecific analysis that demonstrates that the storage casks would remain subcritical for the\nspecific irradiated fuel loading planned, without credit for boron, would be required. In this\nanalysis, the licensee would rely on the fuel burnup to determine the margin to criticality for the\nspecific cask loading. The analysis would be similar to that conducted for the SFP itself, but\nwould take into account the unique design features of the storage cask when determining the\nminimum burnup required for spent fuel storage in the specific cask.\nIn a July 25, 2005, letter to the NRC, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) indicated that\nthe implementation of the RIS recommendations would \"create an unnecessary burden for both\nindustry and the NRC with no associated safety benefit for public.\" In other words, preparing an\namendment application by performing a redundant criticality analysis consistent with\n10 CFR 50.68 would cause \"an unnecessary administrative burden for licensees with no\ncommensurate safety benefits\" because the dry storage cask had already been approved based\non the criticality analysis and assumptions required by 10 CFR Part 72, i.e., boron credit with no\nA-8\n\nburnup credit. NEI reiterated its position at a meeting with the NRC staff on November 10,\n2005.\nSubsequent to the November 10, 2005, meeting, the NRC decided to examine the\nlikelihood of criticality in casks while submerged in SFPs during loading or unloading in the\nevent of a boron dilution in SFPs due to natural phenomena and other scenarios. Based on the\nlow likelihood of such an event, NRC has determined that a revision to 10 CFR 50.68 clarifying\nthat the requirements of 10 CFR Part 71 or 72, as appropriate, apply to transportation packages\nand storage casks during loading and unloading operations while submerged in a PWR SFP.\nThis issue does not apply to boiling water reactors (BWR) because BWR SFPs do not contain\nboron and dry storage casks that are used to load BWR fuel do not rely on boron to maintain\nsubcriticality. As discussed below, there is no safety benefit from requiring the licensee to\nconduct a site specific analysis to comply with 10 CFR 50.68(b) in support of dry storage cask\nloading, fuel storage, or unloading activities.\nIV. Technical Evaluation:\nIn assessing the proposed change to 10 CFR 50.68, the staff considered what type of\nevents could lead to damage of the fuel in a storage cask as a result of the proposed change.\nSince the central issue in the application of the regulations is whether boron is credited as a\ncontrol for avoiding an accidental criticality, events that reduce the boron concentration in the\nstorage cask were considered the only events that would be affected by the proposed change.\nThere are two types of scenarios in which a boron dilution could occur. A rapid drain down and\nsubsequent reflood of the SFP or in leakage from the SFP cooling system or from an unborated\nwater source in the vicinity of the SFP (i.e., fire suppression system) that would go undetected\nA-9\n\nby normal licensee activities (slow boron dilution event). Each of these scenarios are\naddressed below.\na. Slow Boron Dilution Event\nThe possibility of a slow boron dilution event resulting in an accidental criticality event in\na storage cask in a SFP is highly unlikely based on the requirements contained in the technical\nspecifications attached to the Certificate of Compliance issued under 10 CFR Part 71 or 72 for\nthe specific cask design.\nThe storage cask technical specifications require measurements of the concentration of\ndissolved boron in a SFP before and during cask loading and unloading operations. At a point a\nfew hours prior to insertion of the first fuel assembly into a storage cask, independent\nmeasurements of the dissolved boron concentration in the SFP are performed. During the\nloading and unloading operation, the dissolved boron concentration in the water is confirmed at\nintervals that do not exceed 72 hours. The measurements of the dissolved boron in the SFP\nare performed independently by two different individuals gathering two different samples. This\nredundancy reduces the possibility of an error and increases the accuracy of the measurement\nthat is used to confirm that the boron concentration is in compliance with the storage cask's\ntechnical specifications. These measurements are continued until the storage cask is removed\nfrom the SFP or the fuel is removed from the cask.\nIn addition to the storage cask technical specification boron concentration sampling\nrequirements, 10 CFR Part 72 also requires criticality monitoring. As stated in\n10 CFR 72.124(c), a criticality monitoring system is required for dry storage cask loading,\nstorage, or unloading operations:\n\"A criticality monitoring system shall be maintained in each area where special nuclear\nmaterial is handled, used, or stored which will energize clearly audible alarm signals if\naccidental criticality occurs. Underwater monitoring is not required when special nuclear\nmaterial is handled or stored beneath water shielding. Monitoring of dry storage areas\nA-10\n\nwhere special nuclear material is packaged in its stored configuration under a license\nissued under this subpart is not required.\"\nAlthough 10 CFR 72.124(c) states \"underwater [criticality] monitoring is not required,\"\ncriticality monitoring is required when special nuclear material is handled, used, or stored at\nfacilities were the requirements of 10 CFR Part 72 apply. Criticality monitoring can be from\nabove the water to satisfy this requirement. The facilities to which this requirement applies\ninclude 10 CFR Part 50 SFPs when loading, storing, or unloading fuel in storage casks licensed\nunder 10 CFR Part 72. The underlying intent of 10 CFR 72.124(c) is that criticality monitors are\nrequired under circumstances were an accidental criticality could occur as the result of changes\nin the critical configuration of special nuclear material. As such, storage cask loading and\nunloading activities need to be monitored to provide reasonable assurance that these fuel\nhandling activities (changes in the critical configuration) do not result in an accidental criticality.\nWhen storing fuel in a storage cask that requires boron to remain subcritical while\nsubmerged in the SFP, the critical configuration can be affected by changes to the moderation\n(temperature changes of the water) or boron concentration. The primary concern during\nstorage under these circumstances is the dilution of the boron concentration. Therefore, to\nmeet the underlying intent of 10 CFR 72.124(c) either criticality monitors are required to detect\nan accidental criticality or controls are necessary to preclude a boron dilution event that could\nlead to an accidental criticality. As previously discussed, periodic sampling (at intervals no\ngreater than 72 hours) of the boron concentration is required when fuel is stored in storage\ncasks in the SFP. The requirement to periodically sample the boron concentration provides\nreasonable assurance that should a slow boron dilution event occur, it would be identified such\nthat actions could be taken to preclude an accidental criticality and thereby meet the underlying\nintent of 10 CFR 72.124(c).\nA-11\n\nA slow boron dilution event would require that an unborated source of water be injected\ninto the SFP and be undetected by normal plant operational activities for sufficient duration to\nallow the boron concentration to drop below the level required to maintain a storage cask\nsubcritical. First, consider the nature of the boron dilution event that would be required to dilute\nthe SFP boron concentration from the storage cask technical specification concentration level\n(typically about 2200 ppm) to the critical boron concentration value (typically around 1800 ppm).\nThe in leakage rate would have to be large enough to dilute the entire volume of the pool\nbetween the time of the initial boron concentration sample and the time of the subsequent boron\nconcentration sample and yet be small enough to remain undetected. Cask loading and\nunloading are conducted by licensed operators who are present during any fuel movement. It is\nreasonable to conclude that these operators would detect all but the smallest increases in SFP\nlevel that would be indicative of a slow boron dilution event. Second, consider the storage\ncasks loading and unloading operation frequency and duration. The frequency and duration\ndepend on the dry storage needs and the reactor facility design. Based on historical average\ndata, only a few casks (on the order of about 5 casks) are loaded each year at an operating\nreactor that is in need of dry storage. Third, consider that the time a storage cask is actually\nloaded with fuel while in the SFP is typically between 24 and 72 hours. When all of these\nfactors are considered, it is clear that the likelihood of an undetected slow boron dilution event\noccurring during the time that a storage cask is loaded with fuel in the SFP is very remote.\nAnother scenario that could result in a slow boron dilution event is the intentional\ninjection of unborated water into the storage cask while loaded with fuel. A person would need\naccess to a source of unborated water and a means for injecting the water directly into the cask\n(e.g., using a fire hose). While it is possible that someone could intentionally inject unborated\nwater into the cask, it is highly unlikely that this could be done without being promptly detected\nby other licensee personnel monitoring cask loading or unloading activities. This scenario\nA-12\n\nwould result in a localized dilution of boron concentration in the storage cask. As the soluble\nboron concentration decreased in the storage cask, the fuel in the cask could become critical.\nThe inadvertent criticality would be detected by the criticality monitors required by\n10 CFR 72.124 during cask loading and unloading operations. As such, the licensee would be\nnotified of the inadvertent criticality and could take action to stop the intentional injection of\nunborated water into the cask, re-establish a subcritical boron concentration in the cask, and\nterminate the inadvertent criticality event. This scenario is essentially the same as any other\nslow boron dilution event in that it requires an undetected injection of unborated water into a\ncask that is loaded with fuel.\nWith the controls of the storage cask technical specifications related to monitoring boron\nconcentration, the requirements of 10 CFR 72.124(c) for criticality monitoring to detect and\navoid an accidental criticality, and the very remote likelihood of an undetected slow boron\ndilution event occurring at the time a storage cask is being loaded, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat considering a slow boron dilution event there is no safety benefit in requiring a licensee to\nconduct a site specific analysis to demonstrate that a dry storage cask will remain subcritical in\nan unborated condition as required by 10 CFR 50.68(b).\nb. Rapid Drain Down Event\nA rapid drain down event could be postulated if there were an event that caused a\ncatastrophic failure of the SFP liner and supporting concrete structure. If there were a\ncatastrophic failure of the SFP liner that resulted in a rapid drain down while a storage cask was\nin the SFP, the borated water in the storage cask would likely remain in the storage cask\nproviding reasonable assurance that the fuel would be cooled and remain subcritical. However,\nif the storage cask were to become dry, the design of the storage cask would allow the fuel to\nremain cooled, and without water as a moderator the fuel in the storage cask would be\nsignificantly subcritical.\nA-13\n\nTo assess whether there is a safety benefit from requiring licensees to conduct an\nanalysis of storage casks assuming no boron as the result of a rapid SFP drain down event\nthree factors were considered in the NRC's assessment. The first factor is the probability that a\nstorage cask will be in the SFP, loaded with fuel. The second factor is whether there are\ncredible scenarios that could result in the rapid drain down of the SFP. The third factor is\nwhether a boron dilution event would occur in the storage casks if the rapid SFP drain down\nevent were to occur. As described below, when taken together, it is clear that it is not\nnecessary to require licensees to conduct additional criticality analyses to demonstrate that the\nstorage casks will remain subcritical assuming no boron as required by 10 CFR 50.68 in\nresponse to a SFP rapid drain down event due to its highly unlikely occurrence.\nFor the first factor, historical data suggests that approximately five storage casks are\nloaded on a annual basis at those facilities that need dry storage. The casks are typically in the\nSFP with fuel installed for as long as 72 hours. Using 72 hours and the historical data as initial\nassumptions, the probability of a storage cask loaded with spent fuel being in a SFP is about\n4E-2/yr. Licensees only have the capability of moving one storage cask at a time into or out of\nthe SFP. The total time it typically takes to bring a storage cask into the SFP, load it with fuel,\nand remove it from the SFP area for transport to the ISFSI is between 3 and 5 days. If a\nlicensee were to continuously load storage casks, assuming the shortest duration to complete\nthe transfer cycle (24 hours to transfer the cask from outside the building into the spent fuel\npool; loading two to three assemblies per hour, or 12 hours to load the cask to capacity; and 36\nhours for removing the cask from the spent fuel pool, sealing the cask and removing it from the\nbuilding), the licensee would be able to load approximately 120 storage casks per year. Under\nthese assumptions, the probability of having a storage cask loaded with fuel in the SFP would\nincrease to 1.6E-1/year. If one assumes that it is possible to load 1 storage cask a week (for a\nA-14\n\ntotal of 52 casks a year) this would result in a probability of having a cask that is loaded with fuel\nphysically in the pool of 4E-1/year.\nFor the second factor, the NRC has assessed the possibility of rapid drain down events\nat SFPs. From NUREG-1738, \"Technical Study of Spent Fuel Pool Accident Risk at\nDecommissioning Nuclear Power Plants,\" phenomena that could cause such a catastrophic\nfailure include a storage cask drop (event frequency of about 2E-7/year), an aircraft impact\n(event frequency of about 2.9E-9/year), a tornado missile (event frequency of <1E-9/year) or a\nseismic event. A dropped storage cask does not affect the proposed change to 10 CFR 50.68\nbecause the dilution of boron in the cask is the issue of interest. When moving a storage cask,\nit is either empty (no fuel) or has fuel stored in it with a closure lid installed. In each case a\nboron dilution event that could result in an accidental criticality in a dry storage cask would be\nprecluded. The aircraft impact and tornado missile events are of such a low frequency that they\ndo not need to be considered within the scope of the proposed change. However, the\nconsequences of the aircraft and tornado events would be similar to a SFP liner rupture due to\nother events (such as an earthquake). This leaves a seismic event as the only initiating event\nfor a rapid drain down of a SFP that may be credible.\nIn Sections 3.5.1 and 3.7.2 of NUREG-1738, the NRC describes the beyond design\nbasis seismic event that would have to occur to result in a rapid drain down of a SFP. Given the\nrobust structural design of the spent fuel pools, the NRC expects that a seismic event with a\npeak spectral acceleration several times larger than the safe shutdown earthquake (SSE) would\nbe required to produce a catastrophic failure of the structure.\nThere are two information sources that the NRC relies upon to provide reasonable\nestimates of seismic event frequency: 1) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)\nseismic hazard curves, published in NUREG-1488, \"Revised Livermore Seismic Hazard\nEstimates for Sixty-Nine Nuclear Power Plant Sites East of the Rocky Mountains;\" and 2)\nA-15\n\nElectric Power Research Institute (EPRI) seismic hazard curves, published in EPRI NP-4726,\n\"Seismic Hazard Methodology for the Central and Eastern United States.\" Both the LLNL and\nEPRI hazard estimates were developed as best estimates based on data extrapolation and\nexpert opinion and are considered valid by the NRC.\nIn NUREG-1738, a general high confidence with a low probability of failure (HCLPF)\ncapacity of 1.2g peak spectral acceleration (PSA), which is equivalent to about 0.5g peak\nground acceleration (PGA), is established for SFPs. Under 10 CFR Part 100, \"Seismic and\nGeologic Siting Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,\" the minimum SSE seismic PGA value is\n0.1g. Typical PGA values for plants east of the Rocky Mountains range from 0.1g to 0.25g and\nthe PGA values for plants west of the Rocky Mountains range from 0.25g to 0.75g. Using the\nLLNL seismic hazard curves, with a SFP HCLPF capacity of 1.2g PSA, the mean frequency of a\nseismically-induced rapid drain down event is estimated to be about 2E-6/year, ranging from\nless than 1E-7/year to 1.4E-5/year, depending on the site-specific seismic hazard. The EPRI\nseismic hazard curves provide a mean frequency of a seismically-induced rapid drain down\nevent of about 2E-7/year, ranging from less than 1E-8/year to about 2E-6/year, depending on\nthe site-specific seismic hazard.\nFor sites west of the Rocky Mountains, the SFP HCLPF capacity would be site-specific,\nbut would be at least equal to the SSE. The SSE for Columbia is 0.25g PGA and has an annual\nprobability of exceedance (APE) of 2E-4. However, it is important to note that a seismic event\ncapable of rupturing the SFP would have to be much greater than the SSE. Therefore, it is\nreasonable to conclude that mean frequency of a seismically-induced rapid drain down event at\nColumbia is bounded by the analysis for plants East of the Rocky Mountains.\nDiablo Canyon's SSE is 0.75g PGA with an APE of 2.5E-4. San Onofre's SSE is 0.5g\nPGA with an APE of 5E-4. An SSE is the earthquake that is expected to occur that produces\nthe maximum ground motion for which certain structures must remain capable of performing\nA-16\n\ntheir safety function. SFPs are designed to remain functional following an SSE. Further, as\nnoted for all of the other SFPs, the as-designed and as-built structures have significant margin\nto failure and are capable of remaining functional (not subject to a rapid drain down event) for\nearthquakes well above the SSE. Both the Diablo Canyon and San Onofre SFPs were\ndesigned and constructed in a manner that provides significant structural margin. Therefore, it\nis reasonable to conclude that the probability of an earthquake causing a rapid drain down\nevent would be similar to the probabilities determined for plants East of the Rocky Mountains.\nAs such, the NRC concluded that for these two plants, specific SFP failure probabilities where\nnot a factor that would have an adverse affect on its determination with regard to the\nacceptability of the proposed change to 10 CFR 50.68.\nBased on the above, it would take a seismic event significantly greater than the design\nbasis SSE to credibly cause a SFP rapid drain down event. Using the most conservative results\nfor a seismically-induced SFP rapid drain down event (1.4E-5) and the probability of having a\nstorage cask with fuel installed in the pool (4E-1), the probability of having a SFP rapid drain\ndown event when a storage cask is in the pool would likely be significantly less than 5.6E-6.\nThis is a low probability of SFP failure when a dry storage cask is in the SFP. Coupled with the\nfact that to reach this low probability would require a seismic event well in excess of the SSE,\nthe NRC concludes there is no safety benefit from requiring the licensee to conduct a site\nspecific analysis in support of storage cask loading, fuel storage, or unloading activities.\nFor the third factor, a rapid drain down event is considered to be a gross, rapid loss of\nthe water that provides cooling for the spent fuel. This event is beyond the licensing basis for\nPWR plants. Minor leakage is not considered to constitute failure. As such, a rapid drain down\nevent would have to exceed the makeup capability of the normal and alternative water supplies\nby a significant amount to drain the pool in a short period. The makeup capacities available to\nrefill the SFPs typically range from about 20 gallons per minute (gpm) for normal makeup to\nA-17\n\naround 1000 gpm for alternative makeup supplies such as the fire suppression system. Many\nsites have the capability to supply borated water to refill the spent fuel pool. However, to\nassess the affect of a rapid drain down event on a boron dilution event in a dry storage cask,\nthe NRC assumed that the makeup would be from an unborated water source such as a fire\nsuppression system. The main concern with a rapid drain down event as it affects a dry storage\ncask is subsequently diluting the boron concentration in the cask during the attempt to refill the\nSFP to keep the fuel stored in the pool cooled to preclude overheating the fuel and a loss of fuel\ncladding integrity. Therefore, the assumption that a licensee would use an unborated source of\nwater, such as the fire suppression system, with the largest capacity available to provide cooling\nwater in its attempt to reflood the SFP following a rapid drain down event is reasonable given\nthe importance of quickly re-establishing cooling of the fuel stored in the SFP. The need to\nestablish alternative means for cooling the fuel stored in the SFP during a rapid drain down\nevent is independent of whether a storage cask is located in the SFP and therefore, has no\nrelation to the proposed change to 10 CFR 50.68.\nThe NRC considered four scenarios when assessing the affect of a rapid drain down\nevent on diluting the boron concentration in a dry storage cask. First, the cask might drain as\nthe SFP drains (some older cask designs have drain ports at the bottom of the cask) and the\nlicensee is unable to reflood the SFP because the leak rate is well in excess of the normal or\nalternate makeup capacity available to reflood the SFP. This scenario results in the fuel stored\nin the dry storage cask in essentially the same condition under which it would be permanently\nstored. The geometrical configuration of the dry storage casks are such that without the water,\nthe fuel will remain subcritical. Further, the dry storage cask is designed to remove the decay\nheat from the fuel in this configuration, so excessive cladding temperatures would not be\nreached and there would be no fuel damage.\nA-18\n\nThe second scenario involves those storage casks that do not have drain ports at the\nbottom of the cask and therefore would remain filled with water as the SFP experiences the\nrapid drain down event. In this scenario, the licensee would likely use the largest capacity,\nunborated source of cooling water to keep the spent fuel in the SFP storage racks cooled. As\nnoted before, a rapid drain down event would significantly exceed the makeup capacity of\navailable water systems and the licensee would need to use an alternative means, such as\nspraying the fuel stored in the SFP racks to keep the fuel cool. In this scenario, the water that\nremains in the dry storage cask would still be borated and would maintain the fuel storage in the\ncask subcritical. The fuel in the cask would remain cooled by the water surrounding it and the\nheat transfer through the cask consistent with the cask design. Again, in this situation, the fuel\nin the cask would be adequately cooled and maintained in a subcritical configuration providing\nreasonable assurance that excessive fuel cladding temperatures and subsequent fuel damage\nwould not occur.\nThe third scenario involves those dry storage casks that would remain filled with borated\nwater. The possibility exists for a licensee to cause a boron dilution event in the dry storage\ncask when spraying the fuel stored in the SFP racks. The location of the dry storage cask might\nbe close enough to the SFP storage racks that it could inadvertently be sprayed at the same\ntime as the SFP racks, overfilling the dry storage cask, and eventually diluting the boron. Under\nthese conditions, the boron concentration would slowly decrease and this scenario becomes\nvery similar to a slow boron dilution event as discussed previously. The criticality monitors\nrequired for dry cask loading would still be available and would provide indication of an\naccidental criticality. With indication of an accidental criticality, it is reasonable to assume that\nthe licensee would take action to stop the boron dilution from continuing and restore the dry\nstorage cask to a subcritical configuration.\nA-19\n\nActions the licensee could take to return the dry storage cask to a subcritical\nconfiguration could include:\n1. Stop spraying unborated water into the dry storage cask and allow the water in the\ncask to heat up with a subsequent reduction in the moderation provided by the water that would\neventually re-establish a subcritical configuration at a higher water temperature. In this\ncondition, the temperature of the water may be high enough that the water would eventually boil\noff (be higher that 212 degrees F at atmospheric conditions). If this were to occur, the cask\nwould eventually become dry and the fuel would be in a subcritical configuration and cooled\nconsistent with the design of the cask. As the water boiled off, it would continue to provide\ncooling to the fuel such that the fuel would not experience significantly elevated temperatures\nand there would be no fuel damage; or\n2. Spray water into the cask from a borated water source to increase the boron\nconcentration, re-establishing a subcritical configuration and keeping the fuel cooled.\nIn each case, the fuel would not be subject to excessive temperatures and therefore,\nthere would be no fuel damage that could impact public health and safety.\nUnder this third scenario there is also the possibility that the licensee might intentionally\nspray water into the dry storage cask in an attempt to keep the fuel in the cask cool. Given that\nthe cask will already be filled with water and the importance of cooling the fuel in the SFP\nstorage racks (where there is no water following a rapid drain down event), the NRC considers\nthe possibility of the intentional diversion of cooling water from the fuel stored in the SFP racks\nto the fuel stored in the dry storage cask to be very remote. Therefore, the NRC does not\nconsider this as a factor that would have an adverse affect on its determination with regard to\nthe acceptability of the proposed change to 10 CFR 50.68. However, even if the licensee\nintentionally diverted water from cooling the fuel in the SFP racks to the fuel in the dry storage\ncask, there would be a slow boron dilution event, a slow approach to criticality, and indication of\nA-20\n\nan accidental criticality from the required criticality monitors. As such, this case would be very\nsimilar to the unintentional dilution case described above.\nIn the fourth scenario, the NRC assumed that the licensee was able to repair the\ndamage to the SFP and reflood the pool. In this scenario as the licensee reflooded the SFP the\ndry storage cask would either reflood as the SFP was filled (for those casks with drain ports at\nthe bottom); if the cask had dried out it would reflood once the water level in the SFP reached\nthe top of the cask and water began spilling into the cask; or if the cask remained flooded\nfollowing the rapid drain down event, there would be a slow dilution of the boron in the water in\nthe cask as the SFP level continued to rise. In each of these cases, as the cask was filled with\nwater or as the boron dilution of the water in the cask occurred, the possibility increases that an\naccidental criticality might occur. However, because of the relatively slow reactivity addition that\nwould occur during each of these cases, the approach to criticality would be reasonably slow.\nAs noted previously, the licensee is required to have criticality monitors in place during dry\nstorage cask loading (or unloading) activities. These criticality monitors would provide\nindication that an accidental criticality had occurred. Once identified, it is reasonable that the\nlicensee would take action to re-establish a subcritical configuration. However, as discussed\nabove for the third scenario, even if there were an accidental criticality, the likelihood of fuel\ndamage is very remote.\nThe possibility of an accidental criticality in the fourth scenario is even less likely given\nthe following factors:\n1. Dry storage casks are typically loaded with fuel that has significant burnup that\nreduces the reactivity of the assembly. As such, it is reasonable to conclude that even in an\nunborated condition, the fuel stored in the cask would remain subcritical.\nA-21\n\n2. As the licensee refilled the SFP, it is reasonable to assume that it would be injecting\nborated water to re-establish the boron concentration level required by plant technical\nspecifications as soon as practical.\nBased on the above, even if there was an event that caused a rapid drain down of a SFP\nwhile a dry storage cask was in the SFP, the likelihood of a boron dilution event causing fuel\ndamage is very remote. Therefore, the NRC concludes there is no safety benefit from requiring\nthe licensee to conduct a site specific analysis in support of dry storage cask loading, fuel\nstorage, or unloading activities.\nV.\nConclusion:\nAs discussed above the NRC assessed the safety benefit of requiring licensees to\nconduct an additional criticality analysis to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 50.68 while\nloading a transportation package or dry storage cask in the SFP. The NRC determined that the\ncontrols required by 10 CFR Part 71 or 72 for the associated package or cask provide\nreasonable assurance that a slow boron dilution event would not result in elevated fuel\ntemperature and subsequent fuel damage. Therefore, for a slow boron dilution event, there is\nno benefit to the additional criticality analysis. The NRC further determined that the probability\nof having a rapid drain down event result in elevated fuel temperatures and subsequent fuel\ndamage was highly unlikely. Based on its analysis, the NRC concludes there is no safety\nbenefit from requiring a licensee to conduct a site specific analysis in support of storage cask\nloading, fuel storage, or unloading activities and that the proposed rule change is therefore\nacceptable.\nA-22"

      "content": "September 21, 2006\nLuis E. Reyes\nExecutive Director of Operations\nU. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nWashington, DC 20555-0001\nSUBJECT:\nPROPOSED DIRECT FINAL RULE TO AMEND 10 CFR 50.68,\n\"CRITICALITY ACCIDENT REQUIREMENTS\"\nDear Mr. Reyes:\nDuring the 535th meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, September\n7-8, 2006, we reviewed the proposed direct final rule to amend 10 CFR 50.68,\n\"Criticality Accident Requirements.\" During our review, we had the benefit of\ndiscussions with representatives of the NRC staff and the Nuclear Energy Institute, and\nthe documents referenced.\nRECOMMENDATION\n1.\nThe proposed direct final rule to amend 10 CFR 50.68 should be issued for\npublic comment.\n2.\nThe NRC staff should complete the research to quantify the reactivity effects of\nfission products in the fuel. The results of this research may enable additional\nburnup credit to be allowed in the guidance for 10 CFR Part 71 and 72.\nBACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION\nThe staff has proposed to amend 10 CFR 50.68, so that the requirements governing\ncriticality control for spent fuel pool storage racks do not apply to the fuel within a spent\nfuel transportation package or storage cask when a package or cask is in a spent fuel\npool. 10 CFR 50.68 currently requires that spent fuel pools remain subcritical in an\nunborated, maximum moderation condition. The implementation of this regulation also\nallows credit for the operating history of the fuel (burnup credit) when analyzing the\nstorage configuration of the spent fuel.\n10 CFR Parts 71 and 72 govern the use of spent fuel storage casks and transportation\npackages. 10 CFR Part 71 requires that transportation packages be designed\nassuming they can be flooded with fresh water (unborated), and thus, are already\nanalyzed in a manner that complies with 10 CFR 50.68. 10 CFR Part 72 requires that\ndry storage casks be designed to be subcritical when stored dry, but may rely on\nsoluble boron to avoid criticality when filled with water when the cask is in a spent fuel\npool.\n\n-2\nOn March 23, 2005, the NRC issued Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2005-05\naddressing spent fuel criticality analyses for spent fuel pools under 10 CFR 50.68 and\nindependent spent fuel storage installations under 10 CFR Part 72. In the Statement of\nConsiderations for the proposed direct final rule the staff stated that, \"The intent of the\nRIS was to advise reactor licensees that they must meet both the requirements of\n10 CFR 50.68 and 10 CFR Part 72 with respect to subcriticality during storage cask\nloading in spent fuel pools. In order to satisfy both requirements, an additional site-\nspecific analysis according to 10 CFR 50.68 is required. In this analysis, the licensee\ncan take credit for fuel burnup to determine the margin to criticality for the specific cask\nloading.\nThe NRC staff has determined that the requirement to perform multiple analyses is an\nunnecessary burden for both industry and the agency. As a result, the staff proposes to\nmodify 10 CFR 50.68 to eliminate the requirement for redundant criticality analyses of\nfuel in a cask in a spent fuel pool. Under the proposed rule, the criticality requirements\nof 10 CFR Parts 71 and 72 would apply to fuel in these casks in a spent fuel pool. For\nfuel in the pool but outside the cask, the criticality analyses requirements of 10 CFR\n50.68 would apply.\nWe agree with the staff's proposed revision to 10 CFR 50.68. The proposed direct final\nrule should be issued for public comment.\nThe staff's justification for their position is a qualitative analysis that scenarios that could\nresult in criticality are very unlikely. The arguments regarding the likelihood of these\nscenarios discussed in Appendix A to the rule package are persuasive but the\npresentation is confusing. The use of simple event trees to display the scenarios would\nhave been very helpful and could be beneficial if included in the final rule package.\nThe NRC staff should also consider revising the guidance associated with 10 CFR Parts\n71 and 72 to allow for fuel burnup credit, as is now permitted in the guidance for 10 CFR\nPart 50. The staff stated that this has not been done because the uncertainty in fission\nproduct reactivity effects is large, and has not been quantified. Industry and the Office\nof Nuclear Regulatory Research are cooperating on a program to obtain the data\nneeded to reduce uncertainties. The results of this research may enable additional\nburnup credit to be allowed for dry cask storage.\nSincerely,\n/RA/\nGraham B.

      "content": "Davis Besse Assignment\n\nThe purpose of this assignment was to have you gain some insights into the relationship\nbetween NRC, the utility, and oversight organizations in the safety of nuclear power\nstations. By researching the regulatory history, utility responses and those of INPO, one\ncan gain some appreciation of the challenges of safe operation. Some of you may\nbecome senior officials in nuclear organizations whether at utilities or national\nlaboratories. The lessons learned in Davis Besse apply equally to all which I hope you\ndo not forget.\n\nThe papers generally well summarized the events but I would like to share some\nadditional thoughts that you might find useful:\n\n1. No one appreciated the possibility of the type of corrosion that actually occurred -\nwet corrosion and perhaps erosion due to the magnitude of the leak. Had they\nconsidered this possibility (and they should have), the reactor would have been\nshutdown immediately even with the bad safety culture at Davis Besse. This\nsuggests that common knowledge or past experience may not be a sufficient basis\nfor action.\n\n2. The NRC site inspector did not act properly, in my opinion, to press the evidence\nwith his superiors and the utility to act upon the symptoms in evidence showing a\nmajor unmonitored leak.\n\n3. The utility management was not safety focused since the kind of observable\nevidence was not acted upon even if one accepts Point # 1.\n\n4. While INPO performs in-depth evaluations of utility performance, their evaluations\nshould have identified the lack of a proper safety culture in their management. The\nrating of DB as an INPO 1 plant shows that INPO does not have an effective\nevaluation program given the deep seated safety culture, management and process\nproblems which the vessel head problem revealed.\n\n5. The key point in the economics part of the question is that it is far cheaper to address\na problem early rather than having to deal with the consequences later. While no\naccident occurred, the cost to the utility ranged from $ 600 million to over $ 1 billion\nnot to mention the loss of trust by the public and the regulator which is far more\ncostly. Even if the utility favored economics over safety in their day to day decisions,\nthey need to factor this cost in their daily decision making processes.\n\n6. While not highlighted in most reports, the role of external safety oversight boards is a\nimportant part of the safety system. These boards should consist of people who not\ncompany employees. They are typically experienced managers (some retired from\nutilities or NRC) who are asked to provide independent oversight of overall nuclear\noperations and safety. Had this board been given the evidence (or sought it out)\nduring this period, they could have provided senior management sufficient incentive\nin the form of pressure to investigate the problem much more thoroughly. This\napparently was not done. It appears that the FENOC oversight board were internal\npeople not external.\n\n7. Clearly, complacency is a problem especially for \"good\" performing plants. However,\nit is the management of the utility (maybe you) that is ultimately responsible for the\nsafety of the plant and it is their job to make sure that they know enough about the\nplant to make the right technical decisions. One can not blame NRC, INPO or\nanybody else for safety problems at plants that you work at.\n\n8. A \"questioning attitude\" is essential for a good safety culture with people willing to\nanswer the questions in a timely way.\n\nProf. Andrew Kadak\nNovember 18, 2006"

Assuming mid to upper range growth\nestimates, the 40% level requires deployment of 3000 GWe by 2050. However, the rate\nof plant construction has been limited historically to 20 to 30 units per year globally.\nWith a 3-year construction period and an optimistic start by 2010, about 1100 units (30/yr\nfor 37 years) can be deployed by 2050. Hence, for the 40% level, plants of rating at least\n2.7 GWe are required. To surpass the 40% level as is desirable, even larger plant power\nratings are desirable.\n\nQuestion\n\nIn this question you are asked to propose and justify the key design features of a\npressurized light water cooled reactor (PWR) with a power rating of 3000 MWe.\n\nRules for preparation of your solution:\n\nYou may consult any written material you choose. You should not consult any\nperson (a student in 22.39 or anyone else) in the preparation of your solution. Your\nsolution must be your own independent work product.\n\nRequested Characteristics of Your Solution\n\n1) Your solution text should not exceed 8 pages total. Figures and calculations are\nnot restricted within this 8 page limit.\n\n2) As a minimum establish basic features of the following components and systems\nof your plant:\n- Core\n- Reactor vessel\n- Primary system\n- Secondary system\n- Containment concept and containment building\n3) For each component and system you need only specify those characteristics you\nfeel are necessary to confirm the feasibility of your design approach. In\nestablishing these features identify and evaluate neutronic, thermal-hydraulic,\nstructural, materials and other disciplinary considerations you feel are relevant.\nStrive to identify as many relevant considerations as possible.\n4) Further for the features in 1) and the plant as a whole, present the safety criteria\nand licensing approach you recommend. Here focus your presentation on\ndifferences from the criteria and approach which have been adopted for the\ncurrent PWR Generation III+ concepts. For example, consider topics such as the\nsiting criteria, allowable CDF and LERF values, impact on bleed-and-feed\ncooling, etc. In particular, the \"etc\" in the last sentence is yours to elaborate\nupon.\n5) An acceptable answer can be based on extrapolation of current practice\nmaintaining all current design margins. A superior answer would include unique\ndesign features which you would propose and justify as capable of achieving\nregulatory approval.\n\nGrading Criteria to be applied\n\n10% 1.

Under this partnership, America will work with\nnations that have advanced civilian nuclear energy programs, such as\nFrance, Japan, and Russia. Together, we will develop and deploy\ninnovative, advanced reactors and new methods to recycle spent nuclear\nfuel. This will allow us to produce more enemy. while dramatically reducinq\nthe amount of nuclear waste and eliminating the nuclear byproducts that\nunstable regimes or terrorists could use to make weapons.\nPresident George W.

      "content": "Hearing on R&D Priorities in the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership\nTestimony of\nNeil E. Todreas\nbefore the\nSubcommittee on Energy\nCommittee on Science\nUnited States House of Representatives\nApril 6, 2006\nMadam Chairwoman and Members of the Committee:\nIt is an honor to be called before you to discuss the subject of the Global Nuclear Energy\nPartnership, a matter of considerable importance to the future of nuclear energy as well as\nto the effort to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons.1\nThe GNEP program offers a strategic vision for the expanded use of nuclear energy in the\nU.S. and the world. Its goals are to ease the long-term management of spent fuel by\ndestroying the transuranic (TRU) elements that contribute most to the long-term\nradiological risk and to reduce proliferation risk by creating a fuel cycle supplier and user\nstate regime. This will enable other nations, including developing nations, to\nacquire/expand nuclear energy while minimizing proliferation risk. Achievement of\nthese goals as a long-term objective is highly desirable.\nHowever, my concerns deal with the apparent schedule of rapid implementation of the\nGNEP program elements - a schedule which implies near-term choice and deployment of\nreprocessing technologies, fast reactor fuel, fast reactor design characteristics as well as\nassociated reactor demonstration facilities. These near-term choices are not necessary\nsince alternate approaches are sufficient for spent fuel and proliferation management over\nthe time period before GNEP could provide an effect. Rapid implementation of choices\nis unwise since it threatens the successful execution of a GNEP program. By successful\n1 Previous hearings of this Subcommittee reviewed the security and economic aspects of\nreprocessing, a key element of the GNEP vision.\n\nprogram execution I mean effective integration and coordination of the program\nelements, expenditures which are both reasonable and sustainable considering program\nbenefits, protection of public as well as worker health and safety, facilities with adequate\nand demonstrable physical protection and an expanding nuclear deployment with\nadequate proliferation safeguards.\nMy focus this morning will be on the formulation and timing of the R&D program\nunderlying such a successful GNEP program execution. The broader questions of the\nalternate approaches to deal with GNEP goals in the next several decades as well as\nGNEP's potential detrimental effect on nearer-term nuclear priorities such as\nachievement of the Nuclear Power 2010 program I'll set aside for industry\nrepresentatives and your later questions.\nI speak on the GNEP program based on the limited open literature materials I have found\n(Appendix A). As a member of the general nuclear community, I have not been briefed\non GNEP; as a member of NERAC, I have had access to only a very general DOE\nbriefing and the recent report of our relevant Subcommittee. In sum, I must say the depth\nof detail on GNEP provided by DOE through these sources is technically very meager.\nI will frame my views through comment on the key facilities of GNEP and particularly\ntheir missions and timelines. (Appendix B) It is these deployment schedules which shape\nthe allowed breadth and depth of the R&D associated with each facility. I have found no\ninformation on the projected costs of these facilities. This is not unreasonable since the\nprocess selection and designs of these facilities are likely in their infancy - a situation I\nrespect but which reflects the significant R&D challenge ahead.\nFrom the GNEP website, the first facility to be operational is the Simulation &\nVisualization Laboratory. Simulation and Visualization are properly the initial step\nunderlying all subsequent selections among process, fabrication and reactor design\nchoices. It is here that R&D data are used to formulate and/or validate predictive models\nfor such selections. Our MIT Study on the Future of Nuclear Power (7/03) highlighted\n\nthe lack of such capability in our nuclear program and recommended that it receive the\nlargest sustained R&D expenditure ($100M/year over 10 years) among the eleven\nprogram elements we proposed.\nThe Engineering Scale Demonstration (ESD) is the next facility to be operational, in\n2011. Here the process for separating uranium and short-lived fission products from the\ntransuranics and longer-lived fission products is to be demonstrated at an engineering\nsignificant scale. The transuranics are to be supplied to the next facility, the Advanced\nFuel Cycle Facility (AFCF), for conversion and fabrication into fast reactor fuel.â The\nselection of the ESD separation process is the first critical fuel cycle step of GNEP. The\nUREX+1 process and its capacity at 100-200 tons per year have been selected. This\ncapacity is about 4 to 8% of the anticipated full-scale need for our LWR fleet. The\nimportant question is whether there exists satisfactory basis for this selection process for\nscale-up from the laboratory to a pilot plant. The criteria against which these questions\nmust be answered are process economics, safety, materials accountability and physical\nprotection. I have not been privy to the evidence which supports the current GNEP\nselections. Some demonstration above laboratory scale must be made - it must not be\nmade prematurely because it locks GNEP into a critical, likely irreversible path.\nThe Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) is next operational in 2014. Nuclear fuel,\nbecause of the long lead time needed for irradiation testing, is always the critical path\nitem in reactor development. For transmutation in TRU fueled elements such testing is\nessential, hence the need for a test reactor. Limited testing capability exists in Japanese,\nRussian, Indian and - for a very limited future period - French reactors, which I presume\nis being arranged. The U.S. facility, the FFTF, is now unavailable - is it irretrievably lost\nto us? I support the need for a U.S. fast spectrum test reactor as part of a robust R&D\nprogram. Timing dictates it be sodium cooled and, likely at least initially, oxide fueled.\nSince Advanced Burner Reactors of similar design may follow, the construction and\nsafety standards as well as the regulatory review process developed for this test reactor\nâ Lanthanide fission products are likely extracted in the TAL SPEAK process before TRU\nconversion and fabrication into fuel elements.\n\ncan be tailored to set precedent and practice for this follow-on fleet. This was the\npractice followed in the execution of the FFTF project. While costly to the test reactor\nschedule, such a practice significantly enhances the progress of deployment of any\nfollow-on power reactor fleet. A 2014 operational target date is most aggressive but the\ngoal can be reached in the 2010s decade.\nThe Advanced Fuel Cycle Facility (AFCF) is envisioned as a multi module facility first\noperational in 2016. It will have modules to perform production scale\n1) separations operations on spent LWR fuel,\n2) remote fabrication of TRU-bearing fuel for Advanced Burner Reactors,\n3) spent fast reactor fuel processing.\nThis is the mainstay facility for execution of the closed fuel cycle. It is critical that the\nfast reactor fuel selected allow achievement of both the desired fast reactor performance\ncharacteristics and the needed processing and fabrication characteristics. The economics,\nsafety, materials accountability and physical protection of the GNEP closed cycle must\nbe reasonably assured through simulation and visualization based on firm R&D results\nbefore construction of such a facility is undertaken. The announced schedule of\nachievement of operational modules for these three functions between 2016 and 2019 is\nhighly optimistic.\nThe deployment of Advanced Burner Reactors (ABR) for TRU management then follows\nbeginning in 2023. These fast reactors are likely to be sodium cooled, although gas and\nliquid lead cooled designs are possible. This selection was one of the goals of the\nGeneration IV downselect process which the current level of research activity does not\nsupport. ABRs will be electricity producers owned and operated by industry along with\nthe thermal LWRs needed to achieve expected nuclear power demand. Significant\ndeployment of ABRs will be needed to measurably impact TRU management. It is\ntherefore essential that these ABRs produce electricity at cost competitive with the\nLWRs. Given that the fuel cycle is likely to be more expensive than the existing once-\nthrough cycle and when last built in the 1990s sodium fast reactors were 1.2 to 1.5 times\nthe capital cost of LWRs, this prospect is daunting. To achieve cost competitiveness a\n\nmajor R&D effort on cost efficient fast reactor innovations is essential. Its success is far\nfrom assured. The proposed timeframe of ABR deployment in 2023 is most unlikely\nconsidering the time needed to select and test its fuel, develop its reprocessing\ntechnology, make its design cost effective and, importantly, effectively engage industry\nas the owners and operators of the subsequent ABR fleet.\nIt is also not obvious why, at least for a transition period of multiple decades, a two-tier\nstrategy is not envisioned to allow a fast reactor concept to be designed and tested. One\nsuch strategy would recycle the plutonium plus the other actinides in fertile free pins\nwhich comprise a fraction of a LWR core. Although final passes in a fast spectrum are\nlikely needed because of curium buildup in a thermal spectrum, thermal recycling has\nbeen determined to destroy significant quantities of TRU. The benefit of this scheme is\nthe existing availability of operating LWRs to do this transmutation function.\nThe final facilities in GNEP are Small-Scale Reactors for developing economies for\nwhich fresh fuel would be provided and spent fuel returned to the supplier states. The\nsmall scale is not necessitated by the fuel cycle but rather the electrical grid and capital\nstructure of the developing economy. Such a supply and spent fuel return arrangement\nwould provide adequate proliferation safeguards in an era of worldwide expansion of\nnuclear technology. It is, however, by no means certain that the capital and fuel cycle\ncosts of these small-scale reactors would yield an attractive cost of electricity (COE) for\nthese economies. Considerable R&D needs to be supported by DOE to refine such\ndesigns to a level where realistic COE can be projected and proliferation resistant\neffectiveness assessed especially if fast spectrum design options are to be considered.\nThere are, however, some innovative LWR designs already existing and pebble bed\nreactors being developed in South Africa and China that offer considerable advances in\nreactor safety features which bode well for introduction of nuclear power into technically\nunsophisticated nuclear economies, if competitive COE can be achieved.\nTwo important topics remain - first, the proliferation dangers of diffusion of reprocessing\ntechnology and second, the readiness of the U.S. educational infrastructure to sustain the\n\nGNEP. The first involves the proposition that these dangers are so serious that all work\nshould be avoided, especially since the practical need for deployment of reprocessing is\nso distant. The alternate view is that U.S. R&D is necessary to maintain U.S. credibility\nand influence in international affairs.\nQuoting from a working paper of the MIT Study (Deutch, 2/03), \"There are basically\nthree costs of the U.S. not supporting separation technology going forward. First, and\nmost importantly, we will lack the technical knowledge to be credible and influential in\nthe evolution of commercial nuclear power. Second, we will not acquire the knowledge\nnecessary to develop effective safeguards for operating reprocessing facilities in other\nnations. Third, we will not acquire the knowledge to permit us to make timely and\ninformed judgments about long-term options for closed nuclear fuel cycles that may be of\nimportance in future generations.\" These costs dictate that we pursue such R&D.\nIn closing, let me remind you that this Partnership is a very technically intensive and\nlong-term undertaking. Its execution and certainly its probability of success will depend\nheavily on the technical strength of the new generation of nuclear professionals recruited\nto its ranks. The U.S. nuclear academic community today lacks depth in faculty skilled in\nrecycling and particularly reprocessing as well as fast reactor analysis and design\ntechnology. Consequently, the stream of graduates in these areas is very small. The\nDepartment's AFCI program has started an education assistance initiative which I\npresume will be subsumed by a GNEP program. However, these very limited actions\nneed the existence of the broader program of Department nuclear education support to\nbuild and sustain the infrastructure necessary for the success of these limited, targeted\nAFCI/GNEP fellowship programs. University administrators look to government and\nindustry support of such programs for indication that the nuclear renaissance is real. It is\nironic and self-defeating that, coincident with the launching of GNEP, the Department\nhas proposed termination of its University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support Program,\nwhich is a primary vehicle for supporting nuclear engineering graduate students and\nuniversity faculty research.\n\nIn summary, GNEP is worthy of pursuit; however, there are serious decisions about its\npossible and optimum pace to be resolved which involve technical readiness, facility\nprocesses and scale, and the consequences of redirecting essentially most of the available\nfunding for nuclear energy to this effort.\n\nAppendix A\nSources Consulted\n1.

      "content": "Todreas Comment (2001) on Adamov Paaer (Nuclear News, Nov. 2000)\nThe Adamov article (NN November 2000, pg. 38-42) proposes a burn-breed\nconcept that recycles and transmutes minor actinides to achieve a \"radiation-equivalent\nmanagement\" of radioactive waste.\nThis scheme may be a useful target in 100 years, but certainly beyond 50 years.\nBeyond the steps to taken on GEN 3+ reactors in the next 10 years, there is a 30-50 year\nwindow when other steps are more important to take since:\n1. There is plenty of cheap U and prospects for more. Breeders are not\nneeded in the near future. All the mineral commodities have decreased\nin cost (in constant $) in contrast over the past century.\n2. Reprocessing is too expensive - not doing so is doing the right thing\n(for the wrong reason).\n3. Credits for C02 avoidance should be our #1 priority. This will help\nnuclear power more than any engineering innovations.\n4. Repositories are really underground central fuel storage facilities for\nthe next century (at least). There are several useful developments\nproposed now (Forsberg, Bowman) to enhance repository performance\nwhich could be usefully explored and exploited now.\nFor the long-term future, 100 years, it is not obvious that the Pb BREST reactor approach\nis the clear winner. True Pb versus sodium has safety and spectrum advantages but:\n1. Gas and likely steam cooled breeders can be designed to give the same\nspectrum advantages, and gas may have safety advantages (except\npossibly for LOCA tolerance?).\n2. It is yet not evident that Pb or LBE cooled fast reactors will be\nsignificantly cheaper than LWRs or MPBRs.\n3. The utility of using thorium is constrained by need to denature the\nproduced U233 to 12wIo of total uranium. This requires introduction\nof considerable 30-50wIo U238 in the fuel, which results in this\n\nreactor spectrum of Pu production of weapons grade quality. Hence,\nthis is a potential pathway without intrinsic safeguard.\nFinally, in rebuttal to two key points of the article, be reminded that with regard to safety\nand proliferation resisla~ice:\nA. There will always be a deterministic component to reactor safety\nassurance; no one can guarantee completeness in the identification of\nscenarios.\nB. There are no purely technological measures which can protect against\nmisuse of any reactor facility by a nation to produce weapons\nmaterial.\nPrepared by N. Todreas based on extensive input from M. Driscoll."

The fuel cycle introduces\nfront and back end fuel handling operations which bracket the in-reactor fuel residence period during\nwhich the fuel is fissioned to produce the reactor output.\nThe selection of the reactor design parameters is an interdisciplinary task involving detailed\nanalysis in the area of neutronics, materials, behavior and structural mechanics, thermal science,\ncontrol and risk assessment. However, the key characteristics of the reactor core can be related and\nestablished by a small number of relations best illustrated in the context of their impact on the final\ncost of the generated electricity.\n1.0\nKEY DESIGN PARAMETERS ARISING FROM ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT\nThe methodology typically employed for the cost assessment of electricity production is the\nlifetime levelized cost method. This method determines the cost of electricity per unit of energy\ndelivered by the power plant as the continuous stream of revenues over the useful life of the\nexpenditures (i.e. the fuel lifetime in this case of fuel cycle expenditures) that is required in order to\nrecover the expenditures themselves. It is also called the levelized busbar unit cost of electricity, to\nreflect that only expenses up to the transmission line are included. Thus, the term \"levelized\" means\nthat the costs, originally incurred at certain discrete times, are \"distributed continuously\" during the\nfuel in-core residence period and recovered through the corresponding continuous stream of\nrevenues from the sale of electricity. This method permits a single valued numerical comparison of\nalternatives having vastly different cash flow histories.\nThere are several ways to implement this methodology particularly for the fuel cost\ncomponent. The work of Saccheri, 2003 and Shuffler, 2004 illustrate applications of the basic\nmethodology for the PWR cores. The work of Wang, 2003, for the seed and blanket fuel cycles in\nPWRs, illustrates a more complex application for fuel cycle costs, because the operating cycle\nlengths for fuel assemblies in the seed and blanket core regions differ. Shuffler's approach which is\nbased on that originally proposed by Ssaccheri, 2003, is presented in Appendix A for illustration.\nHere we proceed directly to the results of Driscoll, 2005, which are simplified expressions for the\n\n-\n-\n-\nthree cost components - capital, operating and maintenance and fuel - whose sum is the Lifetime-\nLevelized Busbar Cost of Electric Energy. These results (with some transformations in symbols and\nunits) are presented in equations 1 through 3 and are based on these three factors:\nThe cost of money (\"interest paid on borrowed funds\"), x , is given by the weighted average\nof the expected rates of return on debt (bonds) and equity (stocks)\nFuture expenses are escalated at rate, y, per year.\nThe plant capital cost at time zero is computed from an overnight cost (i.e., hypothetical\ninstantaneous construction), corrected for escalation and interest paid on borrowed funds\nI\nââ\nâ\nââ\nâ \nover a construction period starting c years before operation\n.\nK\n-c\n\nThe Lifetime-Levelized Busbar Cost of Electrical Energy, calculated for average values of\nnuclear fuel unit costs and a typical cash flow history for PWRs (from Driscoll, 2005), clev , in mills\nper kilowatt hour electric (10 mills equal 1 cent) is the sum of:\nCapital-Related Costs:\nc\n1000Ï\nI\nââ\nâ\nâ¡\nâ¢\nâ£\n+\nx\ny\nâ¡\nâ¡\nâ¢\nâ£\nPlus Operating and Maintenance (O&M) Costs:\nyTplant\nyTplant\nââ\nâ \nâ¤\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3a)\n\nâ¢â£\n1 +\nâ¥â¦\n8,766 L K\n-c\nâ¤\nO\n1000 ââ\nâ\nââ\nâ \n+\nâ¥\nâ¦\n8,766 L K\nO\nPlus Fuel Costs:\nâ¡\nâ¤\nâ¤\nFo\nâ¢\nâ¢â£\nâ¥\nâ¥â¦\n+\nâ¥\nâ¦\nÎ· Bu\nd\nwhere:\n\nTypical\nLWR\nValue+\nL\nplant capacity factor: actual energy output Ã· energy if always at 0.90\n100% rated power\nÏ\nannual fixed charge rate (i.e.,, effective \"mortgage\" rate)\n0.125/yr\napproximately equal to x/(1 - Ï ) where x is the discount rate,, and\nÏ is the tax fraction (0.4)\nx\n(1-Ï )b rb + (1- b)rs in which b is the fraction of capital raised\n0.078/yr\nselling bonds (debt fraction), and rb is the annualized rate of return\non bonds,, while rs is the return on stock (equity)\nâ I â\novernight specific capital cost of plant,, as of the start of construction,\n$1,500/kWe\nâ K â\ndollars per kilowatt: cost if it could be constructed instantaneously c\nâ\nâ -c\nyears before startup in nominal dollars without inflation or escalation,\ny\nannual rate of monetary inflation (or price escalation,, if different)\n0.03/yr\nc\ntime required to construct plant, years,\n4 yrs\nTplant\nprescribed useful life of plant, years\n40 yrs\nâ O â\nspecific operating and maintenance cost as of start of operation,\n$114/kWe yr\nâ K â\ndollars per kilowatt per year\nâ\nâ O\nÎ·\nplant thermodynamic efficiency, net kilowatts electricity produced per\n0.33\nkilowatt of thermal energy consumed,\nF\nnet unit cost of nuclear fuel,, first steady-state reload batch,, dollars\n$2,000/kg\no\nper kilogram of uranium; including financing and waste disposal\ncharges,, as of start of plant operation,\nBud\nburnup of discharged nuclear fuel, megawatt days per kilogram of\n45 Mwd/kg\nheavy metal\nNote that these costs represent only the cost of generating the electricity (i.e., excluding\ntransmission and distribution).

In the process we will also identify relationships to the multiple additional\nparameters used by these individual disciplines to express performance.\n2.1\nDischarge Burnup, Bud\nDischarge burnup is constrained by both fuel pin mechanical performance and\nreactivity limits. Fuel pin mechanical performance is assessed by use of complex analysis\ntools which predict achievable burnup subject to limits of fuel pin internal pressure, total clad\nstrain and coolant side oxidation which for a PWR are typically 2500 psia, 1% and 4 mils for\nsteady state operation respectively. Reactivity-limited burnup in LWRs depends principally\non fuel enrichment which currently is licensed only to 5 w/o U235. Achievable burnup is\nconveniently illustrated in terms of moderation effect expressed as the hydrogen to heavy\nmetal ratio H and the weight % U235 in the U fuel, the enrichment, â%. This relationship\nHM\nis illustrated in Figure 2 for a single batch loading where typical PWR conditions are\nhighlighted. Similar relationships for various fertile/fissile fuel combinations are shown in\nFigure 3.\nThe current fuel performance constrained discharge burnup limits for oxide fuels in\nlight water reactors depend on the specific portion of the fuel considered. These limits are\nplaced on various portions of the fuel in a core load by different counties. Further they vary\nwith fuel type e.g. UO2 versus MOX fuel. These limits are given in Table 2.\nTable 2.

P/D vs H/HM for Square and Hexagonal arrays of UZrH1.6 and UO2\n2.2\nFuel in-core residence Time, Tres\nAchievement of discharge burnup in one operating cycle requires excessive\nenrichment as well as results in uneconomical discharge of peripheral fuel assemblies at\nconsiderable lower burnup, because the leakage lowers the neutron flux at the periphery and\ndetermines the core radial (and axial) power profiles. Hence, multi-batch fuel management\nschemes are used which shuffle fuel within the core as well as add fresh fuel to 1/nth of the\ncore at refueling outages. Discharge burnup Bud , operating cycle burnup Buc and single\nbatch (n=1) loaded core burnup Bu1 are related ** as follows,\n2n\nBud = n Buc =\nBu1\n(10)\nn +1\nwhere n is the number of fuel batches. Note that in general, n need not be an\ninteger.\nThe corresponding relevant time periods are related as\nTres = n Tc\n(11)\nwhere Tc is the operating cycle length or refueling interval.\nThe fuel (in-core residence time) and hence the number of batches is also limited by\nallowable coolant side oxidation of the fuel clad and fast fluence exposure to the clad and\nassembly structures.\n** Based on linear reactivity theory from M.J. Driscoll, T.J. Downar and E.E. Pilat, \"The Linear Reactivity\nModel for Nuclear Fuel Management\", American Nuclear Society, 1990\n\nIt has been found by Xu , 2003 that while single-batch burnup depends on many\nvariables, it can be related to core-average reload fuel enrichment, âp from 3 w/o to 20 w/o,\nthe upper limit normally taken as proliferation resistant as\nBu1 = 64.6 âp +13.4 - 240.4\nMWd/kg\n(12)\n(multiply by 1000 to obtain MWd/MTU, the unit plotted in Figure 6)\nHence, solving equations (4),(10), (11) and (12) simultaneously we can obtain the\nuseful map of Fig. 5 relating discharge burnup to operating cycle length for a typical PWR.\nNote that the specific power and capacity factor in equation 4 have been fixed at prescribed\nvalues cited in Figure 5.\nFigure 6. Burnup-Cycle Length Map for a Representative PWR (from Handwerk, 1997)\n2.3\nPlant Capacity Factor, LC\nConsiderable management attention is paid to enhancement of the plant capacity\nfactor throughout the operating fleet. Central has been the control of the duration of planned\nplant shutdowns for refueling and maintenance and unplanned shutdowns from unplanned\noutage extensions and forced outages.\n\nFigure 7 is an illustration of the actual power history of a hypothetical plant during an\noperating cycle which encompasses the period from successive startups after shutdown to\nperform core refueling. Figure 1 is typically called a plant skyline reflective of the imagery\nof the illustration. As shown the power losses can be partial load reductions or full\nshutdowns - some planned, some unplanned and some not under control of the plant\noperator. Also shown is a power coastdown period prior to the refueling period at the end of\nthe cycle.\nFigure 7\nStartup\nStartup\nVarious parameters have been defined to characterize this operational history, all of\nwhich report some averaged fraction of full power operation. They differ principally in\nwhich components of operating power losses they account for. Here we will focus first upon\nthe plan capacity factor, LC, and plant unit capability factor, LCB. Plant availability, LA, will\nbe introduced later.â\nThe plant capacity factor, LC, accounts for downtime from all causes, i.e. planned and\nunplanned outages due to causes under plant management control as well as energy losses\nnot considered to be under the control of plant management such as lack of demand, grid\ninstability or failure, fuel coastdowns, environmental limitations and seasonal variations.\nPlant unit capability factor, LCB, in contrast, accounts only for downtime from causes within\nthe plant control. Table 4 illustrates these categories of operation losses.\nâ Capacity and capability factors are the two most commonly cited parameters. They plus availability, however,\ndo not exhaust the complete list of parameters used by various or industry organizations which report and\nmonitor nuclear plant operational performance.\n\nTable 4 Categories of Operating Losses in an Operating Cycle\nOutages within Operator Control\nOutages outside Operator\nControl\nUnplanned Outages (UO)\nyield\nUnplanned Energy Loss\n(DEL)\nPlanned Outages (PO)\nyield\nPlanned Energy Loss\n(PEL)\nIdle Outages (I)\nyield\nEnergy Loss from Idle Periods\n(IEL)\nHence plant capacity factor is\nLC =\nReference Energy Generation\nReference Energy Generation Minus All Energy Losses\n= Reference Energy Generation\nActual Generation\n(13)\nIEL\nPEL\nUEL\nREG\n-\n-\n-\nAG\n=\n=\nREG\nREG\nwhile the plant unit capability factor, LCB, is\nLCB =\nReference Energy Generation\nReference Energy Generation Minus Energy Losses within Operator Control\n(14)\nPEL\nUEL\nREG\n-\n-\n=\nREG\nwhere AG = Energy Generation over a Selected Time Period\nREG = Reference Energy Generation Equal to the Selected Time Period Ã\nPlant\nReference Power Rating\nUEL = Unplanned Energy Loss Summed over All Occurrences\nPEL = Planned Energy Loss Summed over All Occurrences\nIEL = Energy Loss from Idle Periods outside Plant Operator Control over\nAll Occurrences\nReference energy generation, REG, is the energy that could be produced if the unit\nwere operated continuously at full power under reference ambient conditions throughout the\ngiven period. Reference ambient conditions are environmental conditions representative of\nthe annual mean (or typical) ambient conditions for the unit.\nHence\n\nLC = REG - UEL - PEL - IEL\nLCB\nREG - UEL - PEL\n(15)\nAG\n= REG - UEL - PEL\nNote that all terms are in energy units typically expressed in kWhrs. The times\nassociated with downtimes are real times during which power losses have occurred.\nHence we desire to transform these results to effective times (for operations or loss) at\nfull power so that corresponding times (e.g. downtime due to a series of forced load\nreductions) are equally weighted and therefore can be added. We express effective time in\nterms of actual time and power rating as follows:\nTeff Prated = âTACT (Prated - Pactual operating )\n(16)\ni\nwhere (Prated -Pactualoperating ) is the power lost for the actual time TACT for occurrence i.\nSo if we are interested in forced outage loss, i.e. the effective time for loss of full\npower,\nâTACT(Prated - Pactualoperating)\nTFO =\ni\n\n(17)\nPrated\nTable 5 illustrates the effective time periods for operation, EFPP, unplanned outages,\nTEO & TFO, planned outages, TRO & TMO, and idle time, TI.\n\nTable 5 Time Periods in an Operating Cycle\nOperation\nOutages within Operator Control\nOutages outside\nOperator\nControl\nAt Power\nUnplanned Outages (UO)\nTUO\nPlanned Outages (PO)\nTPO\nIdle Outages (I)\nTI\nEffective\nFull Power\nPeriod,\nEFPP\nOutage\nExtension\n(EO)\nTEO\nForced\nOutage\n(FO)\nTFO\nRefueling\nOutage\n(RO)\nTRO\nMaintenance\nOutage\n(MO)\nTMO\nNow we can express plant capacity factor and the unit capability factor in terms of\nEFPP (Effective Full Power Period), TCB (Capability Factor Equivalent Cycle Length), and\nTC (Cycle Length).\nFigure 8 illustrates these relationships where the terms LA, plant\navailability, and TA, availability time have been introduced. Note in particular, as discussed\nlater, that the individual times TPO, TUO and TI are illustrated only as their sum which equals\nTC - EFPP.\nFigure 8 Plant Operating Characteristics\nEFPP\nTA\nTCB\nTC\nThe enclosed areas in this figure are energy quantities since the ordinate is % full\npower and the abscissa is time.

We can now express plant\ncapacity factor, LC and plant capability factor, LCB versus cycle length, TC, in terms of the\ncommonly used variables TC, TRO, TI and FLR (forced loss rate which is defined below).\nHence from the definitions of Figure 8\nTPO = TRO + TMO â TRO\nand\nTUO = TEO + TFO â TFO\nNow TFO is typically expressed in terms of the forced loss rate, FLR, defined asâ\nFLR =\nUnplanned Forced Energy Losses\n(21)\nReference Energy Generation - (Planned Plus Unplanned Outage Extension Energy Losses)\nUsing the effective times introduced earlier we obtain\nFLR =\nTFO\n(22)\nTC - TPO - TEO\nâ This indicator has been constructed by the industry to monitor progress in minimizing outage time and power\nreductions that result from unplanned equipment failures, human errors, or other conditions during the operating\nperiod. The operating period which is the denominator of the definition has therefore been defined to exclude\nplanned outages and their possible unplanned extensions.\n\nFor our assumption that TEO and TMO are zero, equation 10 reduces to\nFLR = TC\nT\n-\nFO\nTRO\n(23)\nHence TFO is available from equation 23 in terms of the assumed known parameters FLR, TC\nand TRO as:\nTFO = FLR (TC - TRO )\n(24)\nNow plant capacity factor can be expressed from equations 19 and 24 as\nLC = TC - TI - TRO - TFO = (TC - TRO)(1- FLR) - TI\n(25)\nTC\nTC\nSimilarly, the plant capability factor, LCB, can be expressed from equations 20 and 24 as\nLCB = TC - TRO - TFO = â¡\nâ¢\nTC - TRO â¤\nâ¥(1- FLR)\n(26)\nTC\nâ£\nTC\nâ¦\nIf, for example, a 30 day idle time, TI, is assumed along with a 30 day refueling outage\nlength, TRO, the plant capacity factor, LC, and the plant capability factor, LCB, can be\ncalculated for given values of FLR. The results are displayed in Figure 9. Note that the\nvalues of capability and capacity factor as illustrated in Figure 9 differ for the same values of\nTRO and FLR by:\nLC\nTI\n= 1-\n(27)\nLCB\n(TC - TRO )(1- FLR)\nwhich is obtained by dividing equation 13 by 14. From Figure 9 at assumed values of 5%\nFLR, TI =30 days, TRO = 30 days and TC = 24 months, the capability factor is 0.91, while the\ncapacity factor is lower at 0.87. The ratio is 0.95 as equation 27 confirms.\n\nFigure 9 Effect of Cycle Length on Plant Operating Factors\n(assuming a 30 day refueling outage length, TRO) and 30 Day Idle\nTime Period, TI, outside the Plant Operator's Control\nUnit Operating Factor\n0.95\n0.9\n0.85\n0.8\n0.75\n0.7\n\n0% FLR\n2% FLR\n4% FLR\n0% FLR\n2% FLR\n4% FLR\nLCB\nLC\nOperating Cycle Length, Tc (calendar months)\nWe conclude this Section by elaborating Figure 8 to express the differences among\nthe times EFPP, TCB, TA and TC in terms of the outage times (i.e. TRO, TFO, and TI). These\nrelations are not simple because the definition of capability factor, LCB, has adopted TC as its\nreference time, and availability factor, LA, uses TC - TRO.\nFirst from equation 15 and 6a we express the difference between TC and TCB as\nTC - TCB = TI\nâ¡\nâ¢â£(TC - TRO\nT\n)(\nC\n1- FLR)\nâ¤\nâ¥â¦\n(28a)\nAnd by reintroducing equation 11, we can define TI*, the difference between TC and TCB\nTC -TCB = TI\nâ¡\nâ¢\nTC\nâ¤\nâ¥ â¡ TI *\n(28b)\nâ£TC - TRO - TFO â¦\nThe difference between TCB and TA is obtained by first expressing TA from equation 18 as\n\nT\nL\nA =\nC\n(18c)\nTC\nLA\nThe plant availability factor, LA, is defined as the power produced over the operating cycle\nplus that which could have been produced at full power over the idle time, TI, which is not in\nthe operator's control divided by the cycle length minus planned outage time, i.e. the\navailable (except for planned outage time) cycle length. Hence LA is given as:\nL â¡TC - TRO - TFO\n(29)\nA\nTC - TRO\nand LC is given as equation 19. Combining equations 18c, 29 and 19, we can solve for TA to\nobtain:\nTA = TC - TRO - TI â¢\nâ¡\nTC\nâ¤\nâ¥ + TI â¢\nâ¡\nTRO\nâ¥\nâ¤\n(30)\nâ£TC - TRO - TFO â¦\nâ£TC - TRO - TFO â¦\nNow from equation 28b\nTCB = TC - TI\nâ¡\nâ¢\nTC\nâ¤\nâ¥\nâ£TC - TRO - TFO â¦\nwe obtain from subtracting equation 30 from equation 28b\nâ¡\nT\nâ¤\n**\nTCB -TA = TRO - TI â¢\nRO\nâ¥= TRO - TI\n(31)\nâ£TC - TRO - TFO â¦\nFinally the difference between TA and EFPP is obtained by expressing EFPP from equation 6\nnow as\nEFPP = LATA\n(18d)\nHence\nTA -EFPP = TA(1- LA )\n(32)\nApplying equations 30 and 29, we obtain\nTA -EFPP = â¡\nâ¢TC - TRO - TI\nâ¡\nâ¢\nTC\nâ¤\nâ¥ + TI\nâ¡\nâ¢\nTRO\nâ¤\nâ¥\nâ¤\nâ¥\nTFO\n(33a)\nâ£\nâ£TC - TRO - TFO â¦\nâ£TC - TRO - TFO â¦â¦ TC - TRO\n= T - T â¡\nTFO\nâ¥\nâ¤ = T - TI\n***\n(33b)\nFO\nI â¢â£TC - TRO - TFO â¦\nFO\n\nHaving now obtained these time differences,\n*\nTC -TCB = TI\n(34a)\n**\nTCB - TA = TRO - TI\n(34b)\n***\nTA -EFPP = TFO - TI\n(34c)\nwe display them on Figure 10 which is an amplification of Figure 8. As a proof, note that the\ndifference TC - EFPP should be (still assuming TMO and TEO are zero)\nTC - EFPP = TI + TRO + TFO\nThis result does follow by summing equations 34a, 34b, and 34c as follows:\nTC -EFPP = TC - TCB + TCB - TA + TA - EFPP\n*\n**\n***\n= TI + TRO - TI\n+ TFO - TI\nâ¡\nT\nâ¤\nâ¡\nT\nâ¤\nâ¡\nT\nâ¤ (35)\n= T\nC\nT - T\nRO\nT - T\nFO\nI â£â¢TC - TRO - TFO â¦â¥ +\nRO\nI â£â¢TC - TRO - TFO â¦â¥ +\nFO\nI â£â¢TC - TRO - TFO â¦â¥\n= TI + TRO + TFO (QED)\nOf course this result can be generalized to\nTC - TEFPP = TI + TPO + TUO\nwhen TEO and TMO are not taken as zero.\n\nFigure 10 Plant Operating Characteristics\nTUO +\nTPO +\nTI\nPercent of\nFull Power\n***\n**\n*\nTFO - TI\nTRO - TI\nTI\nLA\nLCB\nLC\nEFPP\nTA\nTCB\nTC\nTime\n2.4 Plant Thermodynamic Efficiency, Î·\nThe core averaged outlet temperature and selected power conversion cycle are the\nprime determinants of achievable plant thermodynamic efficiency. For single phase liquid\ncoolant the vapor pressure - temperature characteristic of the coolant primarily sets the outlet\ntemperature within pressure limits that yield tolerable primary system boundary wall\nthickness (PWR) or if the boiling point is very high as for sodium, the outlet temperature is\nestablished to keep the primary system material boundary primarily in the elastic range\n(Sodium Fast Reactor). For a two phase coolant the outlet temperature is set by the selection\nof operating pressure which is selected to optimize critical power performance (BWR). For\ngas coolants, the outlet temperature is controlled by achievable performance of fuel and\nstructural materials (HTGR).\nSelection of the power conversion cycle is typically between a Rankine or a Brayton\ncycle. Both helium and supercritical carbon dioxide working fluids are specified in Brayton\ncycles. The PWR and BWR employ indirect and direct Rankine cycles respectively. The\nthree fast reactors in the Generation IV program are evaluating indirect cycles of both the\nRankine and Brayton types as well as direct versions of the latter.\nThe various high\ntemperature gas reactor concepts under design specify both indirect and direct Brayton\ncycles.\nFigure 11 illustrates the achievable plant efficiencies for various reactor types and\npower conversion cycles as outlet temperature is varied. Temperature ranges for hydrogen\nproduction processes under study are also included.\n\nHydrogen Production\nTemperature Ranges\n2.5 Specific Power, qsp\nSpecific power is a key parameter with respect to fuel cycle cost. For the typical\nPWR with specific power of 38\nHM\nth\nkg\nkW\n, fuel cycle cost is about 5\nhre\nkW\nmills\n-\n. Many other\nthermal parameters of design interest are related to specific power. These relationships are\npresented next.\n2.5.1 Power Density, qPD\nPower density is the measure of the energy generated relative to the core volume.\nBecause the size of the reactor vessel and hence the capital cost are nominally relative to the\ncore size, the power density is an indicator of the capital cost of a concept. For propulsion\nreactors, where weight and hence size are a premium, power density is a relevant figure of\nmerit.\nFigure 11.

Square and triangular rod arrays\nThe power density can be varied by changing the fuel pin arrangement in the core.\nFor an infinite square array, shown in Fig. 12, the power density qPD is related to the array\npitch, P, as:\nqPD-square array = 4(1/ 4ÏR\nfo\n2)q â²â²dz = q\nâ²\n(36)\nP dz\nP\nwhere\nqâ²\nLinear energy generation\nkWth\nrate\nm\nqâ²â²â²\nVolumetric energy\nkWth\ngeneration\ncm3\nR fo\nFuel pellet radius\nmm\n\nwhereas for an infinite triangular array, the comparable result is:\n3(1/ 6ÏR\n2)q â²â²dz\nqâ²\n(37)\nfo\nqPD-triangular array =\n=\nP ââ 3 Pââdz\n3 P 2\n2 ââ 2\nââ \nComparing Eq. 36 and 37, we observe that the power density of a triangular array is\n15.5% greater than that of a square array for a given pitch. For this reason, reactor concepts\nsuch as the LMFBR adopt triangular arrays, which are more complicated mechanically than\nsquare arrays. For light water reactors, on the other hand, the simpler square array is more\ndesirable, as the necessary neutron moderation can be provided by the looser-packed square\n++\narray .\nThe relationship between core average power density and specific power is\nq\nM\nâ\nqPD =\nsp\nHM\nVCORE\nâ kW â(kW kg )â(kgHM )\n(38a)\nHM\nâ\nâ=\nâ lCORE â \nlCORE\nHence\nqPD = qsp Ï HM Î½ f\n(38b)\nwhere\nkWth\nqPD\ncore averaged power density\nlcore\nÏ HM\nheavy metal density in the fuel compound\nkg HM\nl fuel\nv f\nvolume fraction of fuel in the core\nlfuel /lcore\nValues of these parameters for a typical PWR and a conventional pin-type GFR core are\ngiven in Table 6.\n++ The Russian VVER fuel assembly is the exception being a triangular array of fuel pins with annular pellets\nwith the same pin diameter (9.1 mm) and pitch (12.75 mm) as the advanced Westinghouse square array\nVVANTAGE 6 fuel assembly.\n\nTable 6.

Appendix D expands this\ncomparison to other fuel shapes and parameters which dictate thermal performance in\nthe GFR. Figure 15 illustrates these two geometries where each has been represented\nas a unit cell - hence, they will be called the matrix cell and the pin cell. Either can\nbe established for square or triangular geometric arrays. The cell diameters are\nestablished by maintenance of consistent fuel cross-section (for the matrix cell) or\ncoolant cross-section (for the pin cell) compared to the actual array. Hence for the\nsquare array\ndcell =\nP\n(41)\nÏ\nwhile for the triangular array\n2 3\n=\nP\n(42)\ndcell\nÏ\n\nNote that these cell diameter formulae apply for the both matrix and pin cells.\nIn the fuel pin literature these pin cells are known as the equivalent annulus\napproximation.

Thesis of Carter\nShuffler, Sept. 2004, which was based on the PhD Thesis of Jacopo Saccheri, August,\n2003)\nThe basic equations relating discrete cash flows and levelized costs are presented in\nthe following paragraphs.\nIn order to charge the correct price for service, a utility must first decide on the rate of\nreturn on investment, r, which is desired. The rate of return is also commonly called the\ndiscount rate, or nominal interest rate (as opposed to the economists' \"real\" or inflation-free\nrate). Discrete expenditures for fuel cycle, Operations and Maintenance (O & M), and\ncapital costs are incurred at different times during the plant's life. To get the levelized cost,\nthese expenditures are discounted back to a reference date, which is chosen to be the start of\nirradiation for the first fuel cycle (i.e., t = 0). Discounting all expenditures to this date with\ncontinuous compounding of interest yields the present value of all costs, PVcosts, and a\nrelationship with the lifetime levelized cost, Clev .\nPVcos ts = âCN â e-rTN = â«0\nTplant Clev â e-rtdtâ¡ Clev â«0\nTplant e-rtdt\nN\n(4.1)\n\nwhere,\n\nPVcost present value of all costs\n$\nCN\nNth discrete cash flow\n$\nTN\ntime relative to the ref. date\nfor the Nth discrete cash flow\nyrs\nClev\nlifetime levelized cost\n$/yr\nTplant\nplant life\nyrs\nr\nrate of return\n%/yr\nIn addition to the discount rate, an escalation rate, g, can be included for recurring\ncash flows to account for price increases with time.

It correctly accounts for the time\nvalue of money at the desired rate of return on investment. The lifetime levelized unit cost of\nelectricity, clev , is obtained by normalizing Clev by the energy production from the plant, i.e.\nthe equivalent of present-worthing the constant revenue stream Clev . If energy production is\nassumed to occur at a uniform rate over time, the lifetime levelized unit cost is the levelized\ncost ($/yr) divided by the annual energy production (kW-hre/yr). The annual energy\nproduction, Eannual, from the plant is:\nEannual = Q&\nth âÎ· â L â8766\n(4.5)\nwhere,\nEannual annual energy production\nkW-hre/yr\nQth\ncore thermal power\nkWth\nÎ·\nplant thermal efficiency\nkWe/kWth\n\nL\nplant capacity factor (average\nfraction of rated full power achieved)\nhrs operation/hrs total\n8.766\nconversion factor\nhrs/yr x 10 -3\nThe final relationship for the lifetime levelized unit cost of electricity is given by the\nquotient of equations (4.3) and (4.5):\nClev\nPVcos ts\nâ¡\nr\nâ¤\nclev = Eannual\n= Q&\nth âÎ· â L â8.766 ââ¢â£1 - e\n-rTplant â¥â¦\n(4.6a)\nwhere:\nclev\nlifetime levelized unit COE\nmills/kW-hrs\nClev\nlifetime levelized COE\n$/yr\n\nIf, as above, costs and the power are recorded in $ and kWth, and for continuous\ninterest rates (yr-1), then equation (4.6) reports the levelized unit COE in mills/kW-hre, the\ndesired units for the typical analysis. To get the individual levelized unit costs for the fuel\ncycle, O & M, and capital components, equation (4.6) is applied with the relevant cash flow\nhistories incorporated into the PVcosts term. The levelized unit COE is simply the sum of the\ncost contributions from these individual components.\nclev = clev- fcc + clev-O&M + clev-cap\n(4.7)\nAlternate forms of Equation 4.6 of later use are obtained by manipulation if the\nenergy production term.

For examples of such analyses see Saccheri, 2003 for the IRIS reactor, Shuffler,\n2004 for a zirconium hydride fueled PWR and Wang, 2003 for the gas fast reactor. For our\npurposes it is important to point out the design variables which these PV costs introduce.\nFor the fuel cycle costs the present value cost, PV fcc , depends on the cash histories for all\noperating cycles over the lifetime of the plant. This leads to the following relations taking\nthe reference date as the start of irradiation of the first operating cycle\nPV fcc = PV fccv,o +â â PV fccv,n â e-nârâTC\n(4.42)\nn=1\nwhere:\nPVfccv,o = PV (UC fcc,o ) âM HM\n(4.40)\nPV fcc,n = PV fccv,o âenâgâTC\n(4.43)\nand new parameter definition are:\nPVfcc\ntotal present value of fuel cycle costs\n$\nPVfccv,o\npresent value for the first operating cycle\n$\nPV (UC fcc,o )\npresent value unit cost for the first operating\ncycle\n$/ kgHM\nM HM\nmass of heavy metal in the core\nkg\nTc\noperating cycle length\nyears/cycle\n(time between successive plant startups)\n\nFor the operations and maintenance costs the PVO+M similarly depends on O+M\nexpenditures over the plant life. Hence we have:\nPVO&M = âCFO&M ,n â e-râ(n+1)\n(4.51)\nn=0\nwhere,\nCFO&M ,n = CFO&M ,o â e gân\n(4.50)\nand new parameter definitions are:\nPVO+M\ntotal present value of O+M\n$\nexpenditure over plant life\nCFO&M ,n\nnth successive annual O+M expenditure\n$/yr\nCFO&M ,o\ntotal annual O+M expense\n$/yr\nfor the first year of plant operation\nFinally, for capital costs, the PVcap is the construction cost that occurs once during the\nplant lifetime. However, note that in actuality additional capital costs do take place in\nthe life of a plant to accomplish major repairs, upgrades and the like.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL NOMENCLATURE FOR APPENDIX A\nVariable\nDefinition\nUnits\nC\nunit present value costs\n$/ kgHM\nClev\nlifetime levelized COE\n$/yr\nCN\nNth discrete cash flow\n$\nCo\n1st discrete cash flow at reference date\n$\nM n\nCFO\n,\n&\nnth successive annual O+M expenditure\n$/yr\nM o\nCFO\n,\n&\ntotal annual of O+M expense for the first year of plant\noperation\n$/yr\nEannual\nannual energy production\nkW-hre/yr\ng\nescalation rate\n%/yr\nPVcost\npresent value of all costs\n$\nPVfcc\ntotal present value of fuel cycle costs\n$\nPVfccv o,\npresent value for the first operating cycle\n$\n)\n(\nPV UC fcc,o\npresent value unit cost for the first operating cycle\n$/ kgHM\nM\nPVO+\ntotal present value of O+M expenditure over plant life\n$\nr\nrate of return\n%/yr\nTN\ntime relative to the ref. date for the Nth discrete cash flow\nyrs\n\nAPPENDIX B\nConversion Between Hydrogen/Heavy Metal and Pitch/Diameter Ratio (Taken\nfrom M.S.

The hydraulic\ndiameter is the single factor which best determines core thermal-hydraulic performance\nand would logically be held constant when comparing the four element options.\nColumn 2, Cell diameter squared is proportional to the area occupied by the unit cell in the\nhorizontal plane.\nIt is shown here as a function of Î½f (and for the annular pellet case, also as a function of\nthe diameter of the central void, di). Its inverse is proportional to the number of fuel\nelements in a core of fixed volume and power.\nColumn 3, Maximum Radial Fuel Temperature Rise.\nAs can be seen from the column heading, âT also depends on the fuel thermal\nconductivity, k, and its power density, qâ²â²â² = spÏ, kW/m3, where Ï is kg heavy metal per\nm3 and sp the specific power, kW/kg.

First of all (at fixed volume fraction fuel), one cannot reduce gas film âT compared to a\nsolid pin. This is unfortunate because in a GCFR cladding temperature, and hence âTgf,\nis the most restrictive constraint.\n2. On the other hand, AEIP and AICM elements reduce peak fuel temperature.

      "content": "Thermal Hydraulics Design Limits\nClass Note II\n9/7/06\nProfessor Neil E. Todreas\nThe following discussion of PWR steady state and transient design limits is extracted\nfrom the theses of Carter Shuffler and Jarrod Trant while the BWR discussion is\nextracted from Paolo Ferroni's thesis (covers steady state only). These limits are a\nsimplified and narrower discussion than the relevant NRC standard review plan you will\nalso be referred to.\nAll materials are directly extracted from these theses so that the cited references which\nappear in this note must be tracked if you have interest by going to the relevant theses.\n\nPWR Steady State Limits\n2.1.2.1 MDNBR\nDeparture from nucleate boiling (DNB) is the most limiting constraint on power\nfor commercial PWRs. DNB occurs at the critical heat flux, which is a function of the\ngeometry and operating conditions in the core. It is characterized by a sharp decline in\nthe heat transfer coefficient at the coolant/cladding interface, as vapor blankets the fuel\nrod preventing fluid from reaching its outer surface. The result is an abrupt rise in the\ntemperature of both the fuel and cladding, which can damage the fuel and/or cause a\ncladding breach.\nThe performance metric for DNB is the MDNBR, which is the minimum ratio of\nthe critical to actual heat flux found in the core. In commercial design, significant margin\nexists in the MDNBR limit to account for transients, core anomalies (i.e, rod bow),\nprocess uncertainty (i.e, instrument error), and correlation uncertainty. While it is\ndifficult to quantify the magnitude of each, a reasonable MDNBR limit can be obtained\nby executing VIPRE at the reference core geometry and operating conditions. The\nreference core's MDNBR limit already accounts for the needed margin. The use of the\nMDNBR given by VIPRE as the MDNBR limit for the steady-state thermal hydraulic\nanalysis therefore ensures that all new designs will demonstrate the same level of DNB\nmargin as the reference core. This limit is ~ 2.17.\nOne final note on the MDNBR limit is warranted. Using the limit, as described\nabove, assumes that the margins built into the reference core's MDNBR limit are\nsufficient for all geometries considered in this study. This may not be true, however, for\nthe transient contribution. Consider, for example, the loss of flow accident (LOFA).\nDesigns that are tighter than the reference core will coast down more quickly, and\ntherefore require additional margin for transients in the overall steady-state MDNBR\nlimit. To account for this, a fellow graduate student at MIT, Jarrod Trant, is evaluating\nthe maximum power with respect to specific transient design limits [3]. Ultimately, the\nfinal maximum achievable power will be the minimum power given by either the steady\n\nstate or transient analyses, at each geometry. The transient and steady-state results are\ncombined in Chapter 4 of this report for the final economic optimization.\nAlso note that because the equivalence of full core square and hexagonal thermal\nhydraulic models is undertaken in this chapter, the limits listed in Table 2.2 are assumed\nto apply equally to both configurations. The correlation used in VIPRE to determine the\nCHF is the W-3L, which can be used for both arrays if grid spacers are used. If wire-\nwrapped designs are considered in the future, new CHF correlations will apply and the\nMDNBR limit will need to be modified. This is not undertaken in this study.\n2.1.2.2 Pressure Drop\nThe maximum pressure drop sustainable through the primary system is\ndetermined by the capacity of the coolant pumps. Two separate pressure drop limits are\nused in the steady-state thermal hydraulic analysis to reflect the current and 5 year\nexpected enhanced states of pumping technology. While losses occur throughout the\nentire primary coolant loop, the limit is based on the pressure drop across the fuel bundle,\nbecause it will vary most among the redesigned cores.\nThe lower pressure drop limit indicative of current PWR pumping capacity is\ndetermined in the same manner as the steady-state MDNBR limit: finding the pressure\ndrop across the fuel bundle given by VIPRE for the reference core geometry and\noperating conditions. This pressure drop is approximately 29 psia. The enhanced\npressure drop limit is based on examination of pumping capacities for the Westinghouse\nAP600 and AP1000 PWR designs, and a survey of industry experts. The pressure drop in\nthe core nearly doubled between the design of the AP600 and AP1000, and so it is\nreasonable to believe that in the next 5 years before a hydride fueled core could be\nconstructed, the capacity could again double. The enhanced fuel bundle pressure drop\nlimit is therefore 60 psia. The maximum power is presented for both pressure drop\nlimits in Section 2.2.\n\n2.1.2.3 Fuel Temperature\nBased on experience with hydride fuels used in TRIGA reactors, a steady-state\nfuel centerline temperature limit of 750 C was adopted for this analysis [1]. The limit is\nbased on prevention of hydrogen release from the fuel during steady-state irradiation.\nExcessive hydrogen release can embrittle the clad, pressurize the fuel pin, and introduce\nan explosive hazard into the core. At temperatures below 750 C, the partial pressure of\nhydrogen gas is low, and the gas remains evenly distributed in the fuel matrix.\nUnlike hydride fuels, oxide fuels release non-negligible amounts of fission gas,\nwhich, if not limited, can pressurize and even burst the fuel pin. Based on fuel\nperformance data for oxide fuels, the fission gas release fraction can be kept below 5% by\nlimiting the average fuel temperature to 1400 C [4]. This is the temperature limit adopted\nfor oxide fuel. Note that this is more limiting than imposing a peak centerline\ntemperature limit of 2800 C, which is the melting point of UO2.\nNote that this\ntemperature limit only applies to steady-state operation; J. Trant's thesis [3] will\ndetermine if core designs from the steady-state analysis exceed temperature limits during\ntransients.\n2.1.2.4 Axial Flow Velocity\nBecause the enthalpy rise across the core is fixed, a specific geometry can only\nachieve higher powers by increasing the coolant flow through the core. As the bulk flow\ngets larger, the turbulent axial and cross-flow velocities increase, making a vibration-\nrelated rod failure more probable. It is therefore desirable to provide design limits to\nrestrict rod vibrations, and resultant wear at the cladding/rod support interface.\nIn lieu of a detailed vibrations and wear analysis for each core design, J. Malen\nimposed a single limit on the hot channel axially averaged velocity. The limit was based\non a judgment during the initial phase of the Hydride Fuels Project that vibration\nproblems could be avoided in PWRs by limiting the axial velocity of coolant to 7 m/s.\nThe limit adopted was 8 m/s, under the assumption that additional grid spacers would be\n\nadded if deemed necessary by a separate fluid-elastic instability analysis of select,\noptimum geometries.\nThe wide range of geometries considered and the large power increases reported\nby the thermal hydraulic analysis makes it prudent to refine this single limit approach. A\nmore thorough analysis of relevant vibration and wear mechanisms is required. This\nanalysis is performed in Chapter 3 of this report. Because the purpose of Chapter 2 is to\nupdate J. Malen's results for steady-state maximum power, and to prove the equivalence\nof hexagonal and square array designs, the single velocity limit is maintained. The final\nthermal-hydraulic results used in the economic optimization study in Chapter 4, however,\nwill be based on the updated vibrations and wear design limits presented in Chapter 3.\n3.\nVibrations Analysis for Hydride and Oxide Fueled PWRs\n3.1\nIntroduction\nDynamic forces generated by the turbulent flow of coolant in PWR cores cause\nfuel rods to vibrate. Flow-induced rod vibrations can generally be broken into two\ngroups: large amplitude \"resonance type\" vibrations, which can cause immediate rod\nfailure or severe damage to the rod and its support structure, and smaller amplitude\nvibrations, responsible for more gradual wear and fatigue at the contact surface between\nthe fuel cladding and rod support. While the former group is typically prevented by\nadequate structural design of the fuel assembly, the latter is unavoidable. Sufficient wear\nresistance must therefore exist in the fuel assembly components to preclude excessive\ndamage. Ultimately, both vibration types can result in a cladding breach, and therefore\nmust be accounted for in the thermal hydraulic design of hydride and oxide fueled PWRs.\nThe thermal hydraulic analysis to determine the maximum achievable power for\nhydride fueled cores did not account for specific vibration mechanisms; instead, a single\nlimit on the axial flow velocity was imposed [1]. This limit was based on a judgment\nduring the initial phase of the Hydride Fuels Project that vibration problems could be\navoided in PWRs by limiting the coolant axial velocity to 7 m/s in the core. The wide\n\nrange of core geometries considered and the large power increases reported by the\nthermal hydraulic study makes it prudent to refine this single limit approach. A more\nthorough analysis of relevant vibration and wear mechanisms is needed, with appropriate\ndesign limits imposed for each mechanism.\n3.2\nWork Scope\n3.2.1 Goals of the Vibrations Analysis\nThe thermal hydraulic analysis for hydride fueled PWRs linked a series of student\ndeveloped Matlab programs and the VIPRE sub-channel analysis code to iteratively\ndetermine the maximum achievable power for a range of core geometries, subject to user\ndefined design constraints.\nConstraints included minimum departure from nucleate\nboiling ratio (MDNBR), fuel centerline temperature, bundle pressure drop, and axial flow\nvelocity. The maximum power reported by the study for a given geometry was the\nhighest power for which no constrained parameter exceeded its design limit.\nThe goal of the vibrations analysis is to develop and incorporate new design limits\nfor flow-induced vibration and wear mechanisms into the existing thermal hydraulic\nprograms, replacing the single limit on axial velocity. The results will include new maps\nof steady-state power for PWR geometries utilizing hydride and oxide fuels. Combined\nwith the transient analysis performed by J. Trant [3], the thermal hydraulic analysis for\nmaximum power will be complete.\n3.2.2 Flow-Induced Vibration Mechanisms - Overview\nThree primary types of flow-induced vibration are observed for cylindrical fuel\nelements subject to cross and axial flow:\n- Vortex-Induced Vibration: Vortex-induced vibration can occur by two means:\nvortex shedding lock-in and vortex-induced acoustic resonance. In vortex\nshedding lock-in, the frequency of the vortices shed by cross-flow over the\nfuel rod \"lock in\" to the rod's structural frequencies, causing resonant\nvibration.\nIn vortex-induced acoustic resonance, the shedding frequency\n\nexcites standing acoustic waves created by the operation of fans, pumps,\nvalves, etc. in the coolant loop1. Because the rules to avoid lock-in are more\nconservative than the rules to avoid acoustic resonance, only vortex shedding\nlock-in is considered in this analysis.\n- Fluid-Elastic Instability: Fluid-elastic instability of a rod bundle occurs when\nthe cross-flow velocity exceeds the critical velocity for the bundle\nconfiguration, at which point the rod response increases uncontrollably and\nwithout bound.\n- Turbulence-Induced Vibration in Cross and Axial Flow: The fluctuating\npressure fields generated by cross and axial flow turbulence in the core exert\nrandom forces on the fuel rods, causing vibration.\nThe vibration amplitudes associated with vortex shedding lock-in and fluid-elastic\ninstability are generally very large, and can quickly cause severe damage to the fuel rod\nand its support structure.\nIf the pitch is tight enough, rod failure by tube-to-tube\nimpaction is also possible. Fortunately, these devastating mechanisms can be prevented\nby adequate design of the fuel assembly structure for the flow conditions in the core (i.e.\nusing an appropriate number of grid supports and providing adequate stiffness to the fuel\nrod).\nUnlike vortex shedding lock-in and fluid-elastic instability, turbulence-induced\nvibration is generally of small amplitude and cannot be avoided. The principle design\nconcern is therefore not the prevention of the vibration mechanism, but the limitation of\nresultant wear at the cladding/rod support interface. Wear is a concern for two reasons.\nFirst, excessive wear can directly breach the clad or increase the likelihood of a breach\nfrom other rod damage mechanisms (i.e. impact stress and fatigue). Second, wear at the\n1 Standing waves are required for the acoustic resonance condition. They are formed when acoustic waves\ntraveling in opposite directions (as when an acoustic wave deflects off of fuel rods) superimpose onto one\nanother.\n\ncladding/rod support interface lowers the structural frequencies of the rod, making it\nmore susceptible to vortex-induced vibration and fluid-elastic instability.\nThe most common wear mechanism, and historically the most costly flow-\ninduced vibration problem in the nuclear industry, is fretting wear. Fretting results from\ncombined rubbing and impaction between the fuel rod support and the cladding surface.\nSliding, or adhesive, wear also occurs where the grid support springs and rod rub against\none another. Both wear types are considered in this study.\nThe mechanisms considered and their respective design concerns are summarized\nin Table 3.1.\nTable 3.1 Flow-Induced Vibration Mechanisms\nFlow-Induced Mechanism\nDesign Concern\nVortex-Induced Vibration\n-\nLarge amplitude vibrations occur when vortex shedding\nfrequencies lock-in to the structural frequency of the rod\nFluid-Elastic Instability\n-\nLarge amplitude vibrations occur when cross-flows exceed\nthe critical velocity for the rod bundle configuration\nTurbulence-Induced Vibration in\n-\nSmall amplitude rod vibrations from turbulence generated\nCross and Axial Flow\npressure fields cause excessive fretting and sliding wear at\nthe cladding/rod support interface\n\nPWR TRANSIENT LIMITS\nThe second step in the nominal full power method is a transient analysis. The transients\nto be considered for this study include a loss of coolant accident (LOCA), an overpower\ntransient, and a loss of flow accident (LOFA). The LOCA and overpower transient will\neach yield the maximum achievable power for the given condition over the entire range\nof geometries. The maximum achievable power for each of these two transients as well\nas the initial steady state maximum power will be compared and the minimum power at\neach geometry will be obtained. These values are then also compared to the rod vibration\nlimits [4] to yield the maximum achievable power for the complete steady state, LOCA,\nand overpower limits. This data will then be used by C. Shuffler to determine the most\neconomical hydride and oxide cores.\nThe LOFA transient will then be applied to the most economic cores to verify that they\nmeet the LOFA constraints. This limited assessment of core geometries for the LOFA is\nnecessitated by the fact that there exists no method for determining the viability of\nspecific core geometries without performing a complicated full core analysis. Any of the\ncores investigated that do not meet the LOFA constraints will be adjusted. These final\ncores will be the most economic cores based on all previously mentioned steady state and\ntransient limits.\nThe nominal full power method will be performed for both hydride and oxide fuel for\nboth the 29.0 and 60 psia pressure drop cases. The maximum achievable power of these\ncores will be compared to the reference oxide fueled core power of 3800 MWth as well as\ncomparing the single highest power hydride fueled core to the single highest power oxide\nfueled cores over the geometry range. In addition the two fuel types will be compared at\neach pressure drop case over the range of P/D ratios but at the reference oxide core pitch\n(12.98 mm) in order to cover a small scale backfit of existing core designs.\nLoss of Coolant Accident\nThe first transient to be considered is the loss of coolant accident (LOCA). There are two\ntypes of LOCA events that could be considered. The large break LOCA (LBLOCA) is an\n\nANS condition IV transient, while the small break LOCA is an ANS condition III\ntransient. The large break LOCA, being more restrictive, will be considered here.\nA full scale LOCA evaluation over the entire design range is impractical. However,\nusing the methodology of Catton, et.al [5] will allow use of the clad temperature history\nof the reference core as the bounding criteria for the entire range of geometries.\nOverpower Transient\nThe second transient to be considered is an overpower transient. There are two ANS\nCondition II overpower transients which are considered in the South Texas Project\nElectric Generating Station (STPEGS) Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR).\nThe first event is concerned with a main steam line break at power. The second event is\nrod bank withdrawal at power and the limit challenged is the minimum departure from\nnucleate boiling ratio (MDNBR).\nThe main steam line break overpower transient is constrained by the plant's 22.45 kW/ft\nlinear heat rate limit. The rod withdrawal transient is limited by the 18% limit. This 18%\noverpower limit equates to a 16.03 kW/ft linear heat rate. Therefore, when considering a\ngeneric overpower transient, the 16.03 kW/ft limit will be breached prior to the 22.45\nkW/ft limit. Therefore, the rod withdrawal will be treated here to cover both overpower\ntransients over the entire geometry range. The limiting condition will be defined as the\nMDNBR of the reference core for this overpower transient.\nLoss of Flow Accident\nThe third transient, the loss of flow accident, also consists of two categories, the complete\nloss of flow (CLOFA) and the partial loss of flow accident (PLOFA). The complete loss\nof flow is more limiting and will be considered here. The CLOFA is an ANS Condition\nIII transient; however, in this paper as well as in the STPEGS FSAR the Condition II\nlimits will be applied.\nAs with the LOCA, the CLOFA is a complicated transient which is highly dependant\nupon core geometry. Unlike the loss of coolant accident, there exists no method for\n\ndetermining the viability of specific core geometries without performing a complicated\nfull core analysis.\nAs such, the LOFA will not be examined over the entire range of geometries. Instead the\noutput from the steady state, overpower, and LOCA analysis will be used in an economic\nstudy performed by C. Shuffler to determine the most economical hydride cores. These\nspecific cores will then be analyzed for the CLOFA.\nThis will provide the most\neconomical hydride and oxide cores for both pressure drop cases for the steady state,\noverpower, LOCA, and LOFA limits.\nThis complete nominal full power methodology is outlined in figure 2.1.\nFigure 2.1: Complete Nominal Full Power Methodology Outline\n1.

Repeat previous steps for both oxide and hydride cores for both pressure drop cases\n8. Make final comparison to determine the optimal hydride core geometry considering all outlined\nsteady state, transient, and economic constraints\nTransient Methodology\nThe first step in analyzing each transient involves applying the relevant transient to the\nreference core geometry. The overpower and LOFA transients use the MDNBR of the\n\nreference core under each condition as the limiting criteria. The LOCA uses the clad\ntemperature history of the reference core as the limiting criterion.\nApplying the LOFA and overpower transient to the reference core will provide the Safety\nAnalysis Limit MDNBR (MDNBRS.A.L., REF) as shown in figure 2.2. This Safety Analysis\nLimit MDNBR will be the minimum MDNBR for all cores for the specific transient\nbefore applying the \"Margin for Transients\".\nFigure 2.2: Separated Components of Margin for MDNBR\nFirst, the overpower transient will be carried out in a similar manner as the steady state\nanalysis. The maximum power will be determined over the entire geometry range such\nthat the Safety Analysis Limit MDNBR (MDNBRS.A.L) of each core does not go below\nthat of the reference core as well as meeting the other steady state limits (flow velocity,\npressure drop, and fuel centerline temperature).\nThe LOCA will then be applied to the reference core to determine the clad temperature\nover time of the reference core during a LOCA. The LOCA will then be applied to the\nresults from the overpower analysis. Any core geometry whose clad temperature exceeds\ntemperature of the reference core cladding at any time will have its power reduced until it\n\nno longer exceeds the reference clad temperature. This will determine the maximum\npower over the entire range of geometries for steady state, overpower, and LOCA\nconditions.\nLastly, the LOFA transient will be applied to the most desirable core geometries as\ndetermined by the previous analyses along with an economic analysis.\nThe power and flow history during the LOFA will be determined using RELAP and will\nbe used as the input to VIPRE to determine the time step where the MDNBR is lowest.\nUsing the coast down values provided by RELAP the power and flow will be determined\nsuch that they meet they Safety Analysis Limit MDNBR of the reference core. This will\nthen yield the Rated Power for this core geometry under LOFA conditions.\nHowever, as the steady state power is decreased due to LOFA limitations, the mass\nflowrate will also be lowered, in order to maintain constant enthalpy rise across the core.\nThe flow coastdown rate, however, is dependent up not only the core geometry but the\ninitial mass flow rate as well. This is demonstrated in Appendix B. This makes it\nnecessary to iterate between the flow coastdown value obtained from RELAP and the\nsteady state power (and thus flow) obtained from VIPRE until the coastdown value and\npower yield the same flow that value within 1%.\nThis iteration provides a final maximum power and flow for each geometry such that they\nmeet all the limits as previously proscribed in the steady state approach as well as the\nnew MDNBRS.A.L., REF limit from the LOFA transient analysis.\nThis final Rated Power yields the maximum achievable power of the each core,\nconsidering both steady state, overpower, LOCA, and LOFA conditions.\n\nBWR STEADY STATE LIMITS\n3.1 - Common Assumptions\nThe modeling of all the core types examined throughout the analysis requires several\nVIPRE input files which contain all the necessary input data that describe the core\ngeometry and the thermal-hydraulic conditions. Whenever one encounters:\n-\na parameter too complex to be exactly modeled and/or\n-\nreduced interest in a particular nuclear aspect\nthe analysis can be simplified by means of assumptions. They can be conveniently\ngrouped in seven categories:\n-\ncore structure assumptions\n-\nbundle structure assumptions\n-\npressure drop assumptions\n-\ncoolant flow assumptions\n-\npower distribution assumptions\n-\ncritical power determination assumptions\n-\nother assumptions and considerations\nEach category contains a number of different assumptions. Some of them are so general\nas to be common with all the cases examined, while others differ strongly from case to\ncase. Those shared by all cases are listed and briefly described below. Whenever a more\ndetailed description is required it will be presented in Appendix E, using the same\ncategorization and numbering with letters. Conversely, the assumptions specifically\nreferred to the single cases are presented in the relevant sections.\nCore structure assumptions\n\na) The core peripheral region included between the outermost bundle ring and the core\nshroud (dashed in the sketch aside) is modeled as completely blocked, i.e. no coolant\nflows axially through it.\nFigure 3.1: Peripheral Blocked Region\nBundle structure assumptions\na) The whole-core approach used to perform the analyses models 1/8th of the core, and\neach bundle as a single channel provided with a flow area, wetted and heated\nperimeter equal to the sum of the areas, wetted and heated perimeters of all the\nsubchannels.\nb) For the loss coefficient calculation, the grid spacers are assumed to have a thickness\nof 0.45 mm and height of 40 mm, which are typical values for these components.\nc) The present analysis neglects the presence of Partial Length Fuel Rods (PLFRs),\nwhich are actually present both in the GE11 and in the GE14 fuel designs. All the\nrods contained in each assembly are assumed to be full length rods. Other than to\nsimplify the analysis of the wide spectrum of bundle geometries assessed, this\nassumption is forced by the CPR correlation used, i.e. the Hench-Gillis correlation. It\n\nis not suited to analyze bundles with PLFRs since it was developed using\nexperimental data deriving from \"old\" bundle designs, which used only Full Length\nFuel Rods. Moreover, if the whole core analysis accounted for the PLFRs, the J1\nfactor entered in the whole core VIPRE input file would vary axially, but such an\noption is not permitted by the VIPRE code (see Section E1.1. in Appendix E for\ndetails).\nPressure drop assumptions\na) Although a real bundle has a total length larger than the heated length, this analysis\nwas performed assuming they are equal. This is due to the VIPRE inability to predict\ncorrectly the power of each bundle. It has been verified that, both for whole core and\nsubchannel analysis, when the two lengths are different VIPRE overestimates the\nthermal power of each bundle. Conversely, when the total length is set to be equal to\nthe heated length the bundle power prediction is correct. However, because of the\nassumption made, the core pressure drop delivered by VIPRE is underestimated by a\nfactor 1.046 for the BWR/5-type cores, and 1.131 for the ESBWR-type cores. Such\nmultipliers are accounted for throughout the whole study, and all the core pressure\ndrop values delivered by VIPRE are automatically multiplied by them. In such a way,\nthe values calculated are representative of the real pressure drop characterizing the\ncore types under examination.\nb) The axial friction factor needed for the calculation of the pressure drop through the\nfuel bundles is determined from the Blasius relation:\nf F = a Reb\n(3-1)\nwhere the coefficients a and b are computed by using the Cheng-Todreas friction\nfactor correlations for square arrays having P/D â¥ 1.1 ([22]). See Table E.2 in\nAppendix E for the numerical values.\nc) The form loss coefficient of the grid spacers is computed by a modified form of the\nIn's correlation ([23]). See Appendix H for details.\n\nCoolant flow assumptions\nThere are no assumptions common for all cases.\nPower distribution assumptions\na) The axial power profile is assumed to be independent of the bundle radial position in\nthe core. Thus, given a core type (BWR/5-type or ESBWR-type), all the bundles are\nassumed to have the same axial power profile. The power profiles used are described\nin the sections relative to each case.\nb) Consistently with the lumping approach used for the subchannels forming each\nbundle, the radial power distribution inside them is not described in detail, i.e. the\nlocal peaking factors of each rod are not entered as input. However, the non-\nuniformity that characterizes the power distribution among the fuel rods is accounted\nfor by entering, for each bundle2, the maximum J1 factor of the pin-by-pin power\ndistribution under examination. A common pin-by-pin power distribution is\nconsidered for all the cases analyzed, regardless of the type of fuel and the bundle\ngeometry. Such a power distribution is characterized by a maximum local peaking\nfactor of 1.26 and a maximum J1 factor of 1.198 located on a side rod (see Figure E.1).\nIt is important to note that, because of the subchannel-lumping approach used, such\nan assumption does not mean that all the bundle designs examined throughout the\nanalysis have the same fuel pin local peaking factors. Instead, it means that all the\nbundle designs are characterized by the same maximum localized non-uniformity in\nthe pin-by-pin power distribution. Important comments about this assumption are\npresented in Section E1.1 of Appendix E.\nCritical power determination assumptions\na) The calculation of the MCPR is performed by VIPRE using the Hench-Gillis correlation ([16], [4]).\nImportant comments concerning the use of this relation are presented in Section E1.1. of Appendix E.\nOther assumptions and considerations\n2 Since the pin-by-pin power distribution is assumed to be independent of the bundle position in the core,\nall the bundles have the same maximum J1 factor.\n\na) The vibration ratio calculation was performed using the so-called Paidoussis\nCorrected Correlation. A detailed description of the approach used to analyze the\nvibration mechanisms in two-phase flow is presented in Appendix B. Except for those\nconcerning the development of the vibration correlation itself, the main assumption\nmade consists of analyzing the fuel rods as they were hollow tubes, i.e. neglecting the\npresence of the fuel and, for the hydride fueled rods, of the liquid metal (see next\nassumption). This is a conservative assumption since the absence of these heavy\nmaterials makes the rod weight smaller and therefore the vibrations amplitude larger.\nMoreover, the Paidoussis Corrected Correlation was not applied to the whole rod\nlength, but only to the last section, that is the assembly portion included between the\nlast grid spacer and the upper tie plate. In fact, because of the higher quality, this\nsection is subjected to the most significant vibration motions. Given a core\nconfiguration, the calculation was performed for all the bundles, and the maximum\nvibration ratio calculated was compared with the limit value fixed in Table 2.3.\n1.6 - Reference Parameters\nThe predicted core performance derived from the implementation of the new fuel type\nand/or from the modification of the lattice parameters D and P, will be often compared to\nthose of two \"reference cores\". These \"reference cores\" do not exactly represent any\nexisting core, although most of their features are in common with the General Electric\nBWR/5 of Nine Mile Point Unit 2 (NMP2), and with the recent GE ESBWR\nrespectively3. This is basically due to the lack of some data which has been consequently\nreplaced with values derived from different but consistent sources. For example, while\nparameters like the core power, coolant flow rate, number of bundles and system pressure\nfor the two reference cores correspond exactly to those of NMP2 and of the ESBWR, the\nbundle geometries chosen are different. In fact, NMP2 is loaded with 8Ã8 assemblies ([7],\n3 The choice of the BWR/5 and the ESBWR as \"reference reactors\" was not made randomly. The former\nrepresents a model of an existing plant, for which the implementation of the hydride fuel, to be\neconomically acceptable, should account for the presence of pre-existing structures and components,\ndesigned in view of an oxide-fueled core. Vice versa, the ESBWR represents a model of a future plant, for\nwhich the design of all the components is performed to accomodate hydride fuel. Since the ESBWR is not\n\"pre-existing\", its core can be designed with a greater freedom, such that all the potential advantages\nderiving from the use of the new fuel can be actually obtained.\n\nTable 1.3-1) while the reference BWR/5 core contains 9Ã9 lattice assemblies (GE11\ntype), consistent with the current tendency to use bundles having a larger number of rods.\nIt is important to stress that, in spite of the different number of rods, the fuel channel size\nis practically unchanged:\n-\nNMP2 fuel channel size: 5.48Ã5.48 inches ([7], Table 1.3-1)\n-\nGE11 fuel channel size: ~5.42Ã5.42 inches\nContrary to the choice made for the reference BWR/5 oxide core, the bundle design used\nfor the reference ESBWR oxide core does not differ significantly from that actually\ndesigned for this reactor, i.e. the GE14 bundle design ([8]). Due to the incompleteness of\nthe data sources, some of the bundle geometric characteristics refer to the GE14 design,\nwhile some others to the GE12 design. In spite of the different designations, the two\ndesigns are very similar.\nConsistent with the nomenclature used for the two reference cores, the bundle designs\nmodeled are called \"reference bundle designs\", i.e. reference BWR/5 bundle and\nreference ESBWR bundle respectively.\nThe reference core key parameters are listed in Table 1.1.\n\nTable 1.1: Reference Core Parameters\nParameter\nReference BWR/5\nReference ESBWR\nValue\nSource\nValue\nSource\nCore shroud radius, in (m)\n102.56\n(2.605)\n[9]\n120.36\n(3.057)\nEstimated from\n[10]4\nNumber of fuel bundles\nTable 1.3-1 in [7]\nTable 1.3-1 in [8]\nWhole core flow rate,\nMlbm/hr (kg/s)\n108.5\n(13671)\nTable 4.4-1 in [11]\n79.388\n(10003)\nTable 1.3-1 in [8]\nSystem pressure, psia\n(MPa)\n(7.136)\nTable 4.4-1 in [11]\n(7.240)\nTable 4.4-1 in [8]\nCore inlet temperature, F\n(oC)\n(278.3)\nTable 4.4-1 in [11]\n(271.1)\nTable 4.4-1 in [8]\nThermal output power, MW\nTable 1.3-1 in [11]\nTable 1.3-1 in [8]\nFigure 1.1 shows the GE11 fuel design, which was chosen as assembly design of the\nreference BWR/5 oxide core, and the GE14 bundle design, that the present analysis\nattempts to model approximately to use as the bundle design for the reference ESBWR\ncore.\nFigure 1.1: GE11 9Ã9 [12] and GE14 10Ã10 [13] Fuel Bundle Designs\n4 Figure 7 of [10] shows the overall ESBWR core layout. If a hypothetical infinite bundle array is assumed\nto occupy all the available space within the shroud, exactly 28 bundles would lie on the 45o symmetry line\nthat diagonally cuts the core. Of these bundles, 26 are actually present, while the remaining two, i.e. the\nmost peripheral ones, if present would touch the shroud inner surface with their upper left/bottom right\ncorners respectively. Since the bundle pitch and the fuel channel outer width are known (Pb= 6.1\" from\n[10], lbo\n= 5.52\" from Table 1.3-1 of [8]), the shroud radius can be calculated as:\nESBWR\nR\n= 0.5â(27 â 2 â Pb + 2 âl )= 120.36\".\nshroud\nbo\n\nNumerical values used for the two reference bundle designs are shown in Table 1.2. Most\nof the GE11 design values are not displayed since they are GE proprietary. Conversely,\nthose used to represent the reference ESBWR fuel bundle derive from the coupling of\nGE12 and GE14 geometric data available in the open literature.\nTable 1.2: Reference Assembly Key Parameters\nReference BWR/5\nbundle design\n(GE11-type)\nReference ESBWR bundle\ndesign\nValue\nSource\nValue\nSource\nNumber of fuel rods\n[12]\n[13]\nNumber of water rods\n[13]\nFuel rod outer diameter, in\n(cm)\n-\n0.4039\n(1.0260)\n[14]\nFuel rod inner diameter, in\n(cm)\n-\n0.3441\n(0.8740)\nCalculated using\nclad thickness\nalgorithms (see\nSection E1.3. of\nAppendix E)\nFuel pellet diameter, in (cm)\n-\n0.3386\n(0.8600)\nCalculated using\ngap thickness\nalgorithms (see\nSection E1.3. of\nAppendix E)\nFuel rod pitch, in (cm)\n-\n0.5098\n(1.2950)\n[15]\nWater rod outer diameter, in\n(cm)\n-\n1.0322\n(2.6218)\nCalculated using\ndata in this table\nWater rod wall thickness, in\n(cm)\n-\n-\nAssumed to be the\nsame as in GE11\nBundle outer width, in (cm)\n-\n5.52\n(14.0208)\nTable 1.3-1 of [8]\nBundle wall thickness, in\n(cm)\n-\n0.120\n(0.3048)\nTable 1.3-1 of [8]\nBundle active flow area, in2\n(cm2)\n-\n14.4150\n(93.0)\nTable 4.4-1a of [8]\nBundle pitch, in (cm)\n-\n6.1\n(15.4940)\n[10]\nGap width between bundles,\nin (cm)\n-\n0.58\n(1.4732)\nCalculated using\nbundle pitch and\nbundle outer width\nGeometric data used for all the core configurations analyzed, regardless of the values of the lattice\nparameters D and P and the type of fuel, are listed in Table 1.3.\n\nTable 1.3: Key Bundle Geometric Data Used for All the Core Configurations\nCases adopting\nBWR/5-size vessel\nCases adopting\nESBWR-size vessel\nParameter\nValue\nSource\nValue\nSource\nFuel bundle total length, in\n(cm)\n164.567\n(418.0)\n[3]\n149.1\n(378.7)\nTable 1.3-1 in [8]\nFuel bundle heated length, in\n(cm)\n145.98\n(370.8)\n[3]\n(304.8)\nTable 1.3-1 in [8]\nNumber of grid spacers\n[15]\n[15]\nReferences\n1.\nFerroni, P. and N.E.

Acceptable\ntheoretical\nmodels\nare\noften\nnot\navailable\nfor\nparticular\nradiation\neffects,\nand sound fuel-element\ndesign can be achieved only\nby testing\nto the expected\nservice fluences.\nThis situation\napplies\nto swelling\nof the cladding\ndue to void formation;\nno\naccurate\ntheory\nis available\nfor\nprediction\nof void\nproduction,\nand extrapolation\nof low-fluence\nswelling data\nis risky because\nthe phenomenon\nis not linear with fluence.\nEven\nif adequate\nirradiation\nfacilities\nwith\na fast-\nneutron\nflux of 101 5 neutrons\ncm-2 see-' were available,\n3-year-duration\ntests would be required\nto attain the design\nfluences\nof an LMFBR\ncore. In a test facility with a flux of\nneutrons\ncm-2 see-' , 30 years would\nbe necessary.\nThere\nis therefore\na great\nincentive\nto devise irradiation\ntests that\ncan simulate\nfast-neutron\ndamage at fluences of\n1023 neutrons/cm2\nin a reasonable\namount\nof time (say of\nthe order of days).\nBombardment\nof metals\nby energetic\nheavy ions has\nproven to be a useful tool for compressing\nthe time scale of\nirradiation\ntests by many orders of magnitude.\nReasonable\ncurrents\nof H+, C+, and metal-ion\nbeams of energies from 1\nto 10 MeV can be obtained\nfrom accelerators.\nBecause the\nrange\nof heavy ions in solids is quite\nsmall (typically\npm), all the initial energy of the ion can be dissipated\nin a\nsmall\nvolume\nof\nthe\nspecimen.\nSince\nthe\nnumber\nof\ndisplaced\natoms in an irradiation\nexperiment\nis a reasonable\nmeasure\nof the extent\nof radiation\ndamage, we calculate\nthe\nrate at which a beam of energetic\nheavy ions causes lattice\ndisplacements\nand compare\nthis figure with that attainable\nin fast-neutron\nirradiations.\nFigure\n17.20\nshows some features\nof ion stipping\nin\nsolids.

The intensity\nof the transmitted\nbeam is reduced\nto the extent\nthat the\nintervening\nsolid satisfies\nthe Bragg condition\nand produces\nstrong\ndiffraction.\nFigure 18.1 is a sketch\nof the setup\nfor\nbright-field\ntransmission-electron\nmicroscopy.\nThe\ntrans\nmitted\nelectrons\nare brought\ninto focus at an aperture\nby\nmeans of an electrostatic\nlens. The position\nof the aperture\nis adjusted\nso that only transmitted\nelectrons\nare permitted\nto pass; the diffracted\nbeams are stopped.\nAny defect\nthat\nlocally\ndestroys\nthe perfection\nof the crystal\nlattice\nalso\naltem\nthe diffraction\nconditions\nat this\npoint.\nWhen the\norientation\nand/or\nspacing of the atomic\nplanes around\nthe\ndefect\nmore closely satisfy\nthe Bragg condition\nthan do the\nplanes in the perfect crystal,\nthe diffraction\nphenomenon\nis\nstronger\nfor the planes around\nthe defect\nthan for those in\nthe perfect\ncrystal.\nWith reference\nto Fig. 18.1, if lb ; 11},\nthen the transmitted\nbeam from the vicinity of the defect is\nweaker\nthan\nthat\nfrom\nthe\nperfect\ncrystal.\nThe defect\nappears\non the photographic\nplate behind\nthe aperture\nas a\ndark\nimage\non a bright\nbackground.\nThe contrast\nof the\nimage is proportional\nto IT -- I\\..

When a (111)\nplane is added\nto or removed\nfrom the lattice\nby agglomeration\nof a disk of interstitial\nor vacancies,\nthe stacking\nsequence\nof the perfect\nclose-\npacked\nstructure\n(Sec. 3.6) is disturbed.\nThe circular\nedge\ndislocation\nthus encloses a stacking fault.\nThe\ndislocation\nloops\nshown\nin\nFigs.\n18.4(b)\nand\n18.4(d) are called Frank sessile dislocations\nor simply Frank\nloops.\nThe\nterm\nwssile\nmeans\nimmobile.\nBecause\nthe\ndislocation\nencloses\na stacking\nfault,\nFrank\nloops are also\ncalled\nfaulted\nloops.\nThe\nBurgers\nvector\nof\na Frank\ndislocation\nis perpendicular\nto the plane of the loop, and its\nmagnitude\nis equal\nto the separation\nof the (111) planes.\nThis Burgers vector is denoted\nsymbolically\nby\n(18.1)\nThe\ndirection\nis indicated\nby\nthe\nMiller\nindices\nin the\nbrackets.\nThe sign depends on whether\nthe loop was formed\nfrom\nvacancies\nor interstitial.\nThe length\nof the Burgers\nvector is given by the square root of the sum of the squares\nof\nthe\nMiller\nindices\ntimes\nthe\ncoefficient\na. /3,\nor\n(aO/3)3% = aO/3~.\nEdge dislocations\ncan slip only in the direction\nof their\nBurgers vector.\nThe cylinder\nnormal\nto the loop on which\nthe dislocation\ncan move is not a (110)\nglide direction\nfor\nfcc slip [ Fig. 8.2(a)].\nTherefore,\nthe Frank dislocation\nloop\ncannot\nmove\nin the direction\nof its Burgers\nvector\nand\nhence is immobile,\nor sessile. The loop can change diameter\nby absorbing\nor emitting\npoint defects\n(i.e., by climb). Net\naddition\nof the same type of point defect causes the loop to\ngrow,\nwhereas\nabsorption\nof the opposite\ntype of point\ndefect\ncauses\nshrinkage.\nThe stacking\nfault can be elimi\nnated by moving the crystal above the loop relative\nto the\nsolid\nbelow\nit.\nThis shearing\naction\nis accomplished\nby\npassage of another\ntype of dislocation,\ncalled a Shockley\ndislocation,\nacross the faulted\narea. The Shockley\ndisloca\ntion and the Frank dislocation\nreact to form a dislocation\nloop at the same position\nas the original\nFrank\nloop but\nwith\nthe\ninterior\nof the\nloop\nnow\nin perfect\nstacking\nregistry\nwith\nthe\nneighboring\n(111)\nplanes.\nThe\nloop\nunfaulting\nprocess occurs spontaneously\nin stainless steel at\nabout 600\"C. The Burgers vector of the unfaulted\nloop is\nb=3:[l10]\n(18.2)\nThis Burgers vector\nis properly\noriented\nfor glide in the fcc\nlattice\n[ Fig. 8.2(a)],\nand the loop is therefore\nmobile.\nAs it\nmoves by slip, it sweeps out a cylindrical\nsurface tilted at an\nCONDENSATION\nOF\nVACANCIES\nIN\nCRYS~AL\nPLANE 0S%\n--+\nCONDENSATION\nOF\nINTERSTITIAL\nBETWEEN\nINTERSTITIAL\nLOOP\nCRYSTAL\nPLANES\nI\n\\\n/\nI\n\\\n~cOLLAPs:\n((:)\n(d)\nFig. 18.4\nFormation\nof vacancy loops and interstitial\nloops.\n\nFUNDAMENTAL\nASPECTS\nOF\nNUCLEAR\nREACTOR\nFUEL\nELEMENTS\nangle\nto the\n(111) plane. Because of the shape of slip\npattern,\nthe unfaulted\nloop isoften\ncalled a prismatic\nloop.\nIt is distinguished\nfrom the shear loop shown in Fig. 8.6 by\nthe direction\nof the Burgers vector with respect\nto the plane\nof the loop. The Burgers vector\nof a shear loop lies in the\nplane of the loop, whereas the Burgers vector of a prismatic\nloop lies outside\nthe plane of the Ioop. The dislocation\nof\nthe unfaulted\nloop given by Eq. 18.2 is perfect\nin the sense\nthat\nmovement\nalong\nthe sIip plane\nleaves the atoms\nin\npositions\nequivalent\nto those\npreviously\noccupied.\nThe\ndislocation\ncharacterizing\nthe Frank sessiIe loop (Eq. 18.1)\ndoes not satisfy\nthis criterion,\nand the Frank loop is said to\nbe imperfect.\nFaulted\nand unfaulted\ndislocation\nloops are shown\nin\nFigs.\n18.5(a)\nand\n18.5(b),\nrespectively.\nBecause\nof the\nstacking\nfault they enclose,\nthe faulted loops in Fig. 18.5(a)\nappear\nin\nthe\nelectron\nmicroscope\nas opaque\ncircles.\nRemoval\nof the faulted\nregion\nrenders\nthe interior\nof the\nloop identical\nto the rest of the solid, and only the outline\nof the loop\nremains\n[ Fig. 18.5(b)].\nSince\nthe unfaulted\ndislocation\nloops\nare\nmobile,\nthey\neasily\nlose their\ndis\ntinctive circular shape by gliding under an applied stress and\n(b)\nFig. 18.5\nDislocation\nloops in type 304 stainless\nsteel.

There appears\nto\nbe an incubation\nperiod\nup to a fast fluence\nof 'lOZ 2\nneutrons/cm2\nin which\nno observable\nswelling\nof steel\noccurs. Thereafter\nswelling (measured,\nas in the case of fuel\nswelling by fission gases, as AV/V) increases as ({l>t)n, where\nthe exponent\nn is greater\nthan\nunity.\nVery\nfew data at\nfluences\nabove\n1023 neutrons/cm2\nexist,\nand, because\nof\nthe many\nvariables\ncontrolling\nswelling,\nextrapolation\nof\nthe dose dependence\nto the design fluence of the LMFBR\n(-:1 X 102'] neutronslcm~\n) is vf'~\ninsecure.\nConsequently,\nthere\nhas been\nintense\nactility\nin developing\ntheoretical\nmodels that can accurately\npredict swelling at large fluenccs\nand in devising experimental\ntechniques\nother than neutron\nirradiation\nto produce\nvoids in metals\nin short\ntimes.\nOf\nspecial\ninterest\nis the\nfluence\nto which\nthe power\nlaw\nAVIV -\n(~l)t)n extends\nand\nif and\nat\nwhat\nfluence\nthe\nswelling saturates.\n[,eveling off of the swelling curve has not\nyet\nbeen\nobserved\nin reactor-irradiated\nsteel,\nbut\nhigb\nenergy\nion\nbombardment\n(Sec. 17.9)\nhas\nshownz\nthat\nswelling\nof stainless\nsteel saturates\nat fluences\napproaching\nneutrons\n'crn2.

The effects\nof swelling and irradiation\ncreep on core\ndesign are discussed\nin Chap. 21.\nThe origins\nof void swelling of metals are qualitatively\nunderstood.\nCollision\nof fast neutrons\nwith lattice\natoms\nproducesl\nlarge numbers\nof vacancy-interstitial\npairs\n(see\nChap. 17). Most of these point\ndefects\neventually\nrecom\nbine with each other or migrate\nto sinks in the solid where\nthe point\ndefects\nlose their\nidentity.\nThe most effective\nsinks\nare dislocations,\neither\nthose\nwhich\nare part of the\nnatural\ndislocation\nnetwork\nof the metal\nor dislocation\nloops created\nby condensation\nof radiation-produced\ninter\nstitial.\nPrecipitates\nand grain boundaries\nalso act to remove\npoint\ndefects\nfrom\nthe\nmedium,\nThe\ndynamic\nbalance\nbetween\nthe point-defect\ncreation\nand removal\nprocesses\nduring\nirradiation\nsustains\nconcentrations\nof vacancies\nand\ninterstitial\nfar\nin\nexcess\nof\nthermal\nequilibrium\n(see\nFig. 13.17).\nNucleation\nof segregated\nclusters\nof interstitial\nand\nvacancies\ncan take place provided\nthat\nthe temperature\ni..\nhigh\nenough\nso that\nboth\ninterstitial\nand vacancies\nare\n\nmobile\nin the solid, but not so high that the point defects\nare removed\nby recombination\nor migration\nto sinks so\nquickly\nthat\nhigh supersaturation\ncannot\nbe maintained.\nThe type of cluster\nformed\nby interstitial\nis invariably\na\ndislocation\nloop.\nVacancies,\nhowever,\ncan\nagglomerate\neither\ninto platelets,\nwhich collapse\ninto dislocation\nloops,\nor into three-dimensional\nclusters,\nwbicb are termed\nvoids.\nThe atomic\nstructures\nof interstitial\nand vacancy\nloops are\nshown in Fig. 18.1.\nThe collection\nof interstitial\natoms\nas extra\nplanes in\nthe\nlattice\ncauses\nthe\nsolid\nto swell.\nIf the\nvacancies\ncondensed\ninto\nanalogous\nvacancy\nloops,\nthe lattice\ncon\ntraction\naround\nthese loops would\ncause shrinkage\nof the\nsurrounding\nsolid by an amount\nthat just counterbalances\nthe swelling\ndue to interstitial\nloops.\nHowever,\nwhen\nthe\nvacancies\nagglomerate\ninto voids, no lattice\ncoo traction\nis\navailable\nto cancel\nthe dilatation\ndue\nto the interstitial\nloops,\nand a net volume\nincrease\nof the solid ensues.\nIn\nirradiated\nzirconium,\nfor example,\nlarge vacancy loops, but\nno voids and hence no swelling, ar~ observed.\nThe relative stability\nof voids and vacancy loops can be\nassessed\nby comparing\nthe energy\ndifference\nbetween\nthe\nparticular\ncluster\ncontaining\nm vacancies\nand the perfect\nlattice.\nFor\nthe\nvoid\nthis\ndifference\nis just\nthe energy\nrequired\nto form the surface of the void:\nEL,<> 1[1 = .1TR2Y\n(19.1)\nwhere ~ is the surface\ntension\nof the solid (approximately\n500 dyneslcrn\nfor stainless\nsteel) and R is the radius of lhe\nvoid, which\nis related\nto the number\nof vacancies\nin the\ncavity by\n(19,2)\nwhere\nfl is the atomic\nvolume,\nor the volume\ncontributed\nby each vacancy\nto the void. The energy of the void is thus\n3f2m\n%\nE,,,,d\n= 4r17 ()\n~\n(19.3)\nThe energy of a faulted dislocation\nloop composed\nof m\nvacancies in a disk of radius RI is\nE1[,,, P = (27rR1)~d + rrR:-y,f\n(19.1)\nwhere 7d is the energy per unit length (i.e., the line tension)\nof the dislocation\ncomprising\nthe periphe~\nof the loop,\nAccording\nto Eq. 8.10 7d is 'GbJ\n, where b is the Burgers\nvector of the faulted\nloop.\nThe term ~,f is the energy per unit area of the stacking\nfault\nenclosed\nby the\nloop.\nAs shown\nin Sec. 3.6,\nthe\nsequence\nof close-packed\n(111) planes in the fcc structure\nis\nordered\n123123 ... . W'hen part\nof one of these planes\nis\nremoved\nor a section of another\n( 111) plane is inserted,\nthe\nstacking\nsequence\nis disturbed,\nbut the atoms surrounding\nthe stacking\nfault are surrounded\nby the same number\n(12)\nof nearest\nneighbors\nas in the perfect\nlattice.\nHowever,\nthe\nconfiguration\nof\nthe\nnext-nearest\nneighbors\nis slightly\naltered,\nand\nthe stacking-fault\nconfiguration\nis somewhat\nmore\nenergetic\nthan\nthe\nperfect\nlattice.\nThis\nenergy\ndifference\nis manifest\nas the stacking-fault\nenergy.\nBecause\nthe\nenergy\ndifference\nis\ndue\nto\nsecond-order\natomic\narrangements.\n7sf\nis\nsmall,\ntypical\nvalues\nbeing\n'1O\ndynes !crn.\nIn fcc metals\ndislocation\nloops\nform\non the\nclose-\npacked\n( 111) planes in which the area per atom is 3% a~,/4,\nwhere\na,, is tbe lattice\nconstant.\nThe radius of a vacancy\nloop\ncreated\nby\nremoval\nof\nm atoms\nfrom\n(or\nthe\ncondensation\nof m vacancies on) a (111) plane is\n(19.5)\nwhere\nfl = a: ~i is the atomic\nvolume in the fcc structure.\nTh~ energy of the faulted vacancy loop is therefore\n3'ti flm\n'4+ 3'1 fl-y.fm\n~loop = 2nGbz ()\n--\n(19.6)\nna\"\na.\nIf the loop is unfaulted\n(i.e., the stacking\nfault is removed),\nthe second term on the right of Eq. 19.6 is absent, but the\nresulting\nreduction\nin energy\nis partially\ncompensated\nby\nthe larger Burgers vector\nof the perfect\nloop compared\nto\nthat of the faulted loop.\nThe void and loop energies given by Eqs. 19.3 and 19.6\nare rather\nclose to each other,\nand conclusions\nconcerning\nthe relative\nstability\nof the two types of vacancy\nclusters\nare uncertain\nbecause\nimportant\nparameters,\nsuch as the\ndislocation\nline\ntension,\nare\nnot\naccurately\nknown.\n[t\nappears\nthat\nthe void is the stable form for small clusters\n(small m),\nbut,\nas m increases,\nthe\nloop\nbecomes\nthe\nenergetically\nfavored\nconfiguration.\nIf the presence\nof the\nstacking-fault\nterm in Eq. 19.6 is ignored\ntemporarily,\nthe\nenergy of the void increzses\nmore rapidly with m than that\nof the loop, and the energy balance tips in favor of the loop\nat void radii of sev~ral tens of angstroms.\nHowever, collapse\nof\nthe\nemb~o\nvoid\ninto\na vacancy\nloop\nis probably\nimpeded\nby the presence\nof small quantities\nof helium gas\nin the void, and thus voids may survive and grow. Equation\n19.6 also indicates\nthat loops rather\nthan voids are favored\nin metals\nin which\nthe stacking-fault\nenergy is low. Gold,\nfor example,\nhas a ve~\nlow stacking-fault\nenergy,\nand\nirradiation-produced\nvoids have not been observed\nin this\nmetal.\nOn the other\nhand,\nvoids are easily\nproduced\nin\nnickel,\nfor which YSf is large. The stacking-fault\nenergy in\nstainless\nsteel lies between\nthese two extremes,\nand voids\ncan be produced\nin this alloy\nbut only\nat much\nbigher\nfluences\nthan\nthat required\nfor void formation\nin nickel.\nThis observation\nis consistent\nwith the preceding\ndiscussion\nof\nthe\neffect\nof stacking-fault\nenergy\non\nthe\nrelative\nstability\nof voids and vacancy loops, but many other factors\ninfluence\nthe relative\nresistances\nto void formation\nof a\ncomplex\nalloy, such as steel, and of pure metals,\nsuch as\ngold or nickel.\nGranted\nthat, given a choice between\nforming\nloops or\nvoids, vacancies\nwill condense\nas tbe latter,\nthere remains\nthe question\nof why the irradiation-produced\npoint defects\nform separate\ninterstitial\nloops and voids in tbe first place.\nSince\nvacancies\nand\ninterstitial\nare\nformed\nin equal\nnumbem\nby fast-neutron\nbombardment,\none would expect\nthat\npoint\ndefects\nof both types would diffuse\nto voids at\nequal rates and hence produce\nno net growth\nof tbe voids.\nInasmuch\nas the voids represent\naccumulated\nexcess vacan\ncies, the interstitial\nmust be preferentially\nabsorbed\nelse\nwhere\nin the\nsolid.\nThe\npreferential\ninterstitial\nsink\nis\n\nVOID S if'ELLING\nitA[D IRRADIA\nTION CREEP\nundoubtedly\nthe dislocations,\neither\nthose belonging\nto the\noriginal network\nin the metal or the interstitial\nloops. It was\nnoted in Sec. 13.9 that dislocations\nexhibit\na slightly larger\ncapture\nradius\nfor interstitial\nthan for vacancies,\nand it is\nthis fact which fundamentally\nprovides\nthe mechanism\nfor\nvoid formation.\nThe preference\nof dislocations\nfor intersti\ntial\nis due to the interaction\nof the strain field around\nthe\ndislocation\nwith the strain\nfield established\nby the misfit of\nan interstitial\natom in ~he Iatticc\n(the strain field around\na\nvacancy\nis much smaller\nthan\nthat around\nan interstitial).\nThis strain-field\ninteraction\ncauses an attraction\nof inter\nstitial\nfor dislocations\nwhen\nthe two are in proximity.\nHam3\nhas shown\nthat\nthe directed\ndrift\nof interstitial\ntoward\ndislocations\ncan be incorporated\ninto a diffusional\nmodel\nof the transport\nprocess\nif the dislocation\nline is\nassigned\na somewhat\nlarger capture\nradius\nfor interstitial\nthan\nfor\nvacancies\n(see\nproblem\n13.7).\nThe\npreferred\nmigration\nof interstitial\nto dislocations\nleaves the matrix of\nthe\nmetal\nslightly\ndepleted\nin\ninterstitial\nrelative\nto\nvacancies:\nso nonpreferential\nsinks, such as voids, absorb\nvacancies\nat a somewhat\ngreater rate than interstitial\nand\ngrowth results.\nIn summaW,\nthe conditions\nnecessav\nfor void swelling\nare:\n1. Both interstitial\nand vacancies must be mobile in the\nsolid. This requirement\nis easily met by interstitial,\nwhich\ncan\nmigrate\nin metals\nat ve~\nlow temperatures.\nIf the\nvacancies\nare not\nmobile\nas well,\nthey\nwill simply\nbe\nannihilated\nby tbe cloud of moving interstitial.\n2. Point\ndefects\nmust be capable\nof being removed\nat\nsinks provided\nby structural\ndefects\nin the solid in addition\nto being destroyed\nby recombination.\nhloreover,\none of the\nsinks must have a preference\nfor the interstitial\nin order to\npermit\nestablishment\nof the\nexcess\ntacancy\npopulation\nnecessary\nfor voids to form.\n3. The\nsupersaturation\nof\nvacancies\nmust\nbe\nlarge\nenough\nto\npermit\nvoids\nand\ndislocation\nloops\nto\nbe\nnucleated,\neither\nhomogeneously\nor heterogeneously,\nand\nto grow. At temperatures\nsufficiently\nhigh that the thermal\nequilibrium\nconcentration\nof vacancies at the void surface is\ncomparable\nto that sustained\nin the matrix\nby irradiation,\nvoid nucleation\nand growth\ncease.\nAt high temperatures\nvoids thermafly\nemit\nvacancies\nas fast as the irradiation-\nproduced\nvacancies arrive from the bulk of the solid.\n4. Trace quantities\nof insoluble\ngases must be present\nto\nstabilize\nthe embryo\nvoids and prevent\ncollapse\nto vacancy\nloops.\nTransmutation\nhelium\nprovides\nthe necessaw\ngas\ncontent\nin neutron-irradiated\nmetals,\nalthough\nother\ngas\neous impurities\n(oxygen,\nnitrogen,\nand hydrogen)\npresent in\nmost metals can perform\nthe same function.\nAlthough\nsome\nhelium\ngas\nis undoubtedly\npresent\nin voids,\nthere\nis\ndefinitely\nnot enough\nto class these cavities as equilibrium\nbubbles.\n19.2\nOBSERVED\nCHARACTERISTICS\nOF VOIDS\nExcellent\nsummaries\nof the experimental\nobsewations\nof voids in metals have been presented\nby Bement4\nand by\nNorris. s In addition,\nthe papers in two conferences\ndevoted\nto voids~\"7 contain\nmuch detailed\ninformation\npertinent\nto\nthe\nexperimental\nand\ntheoretical\nstatus\nof the\nsubject.\nEmphasis\nhere is placed on voids formed\nin neutron-irradi\nated\nstainless\nsteel.\nVoid\nformation\nin\nthe\npotential\ncladding\nmaterials\nnickel\nand\nits\nafloys\nvanadium\nand\nmolybdenum\nwill not be considered\nin detail.

The applied\nstress is assumed\nto be less\nthan\nthat\nat which\nthe dislocation\ncan pass through\nthe\narray by cutting\nthrough\nthe obstacles\nor by bowing around\nthem and pinching\noff. In the present\ncase the dislocation\nline must climb to a critical\nheight perpendicular\nto the slip\nplane\nat which\npoint\nthe applied\nstress\nis sufficient\nto\npermit\nslip to continue.\nA two-dimensional\nview of the\nprocess is shown in Fig, 19.32. Rows of obstacles are viewed\nend-on.\nThe separation\nof the spherical\nobstacles\nin the\ndirection\nperpendicular\nto the drawing\nis the same as the\ndistance\nbetween\nrows in the glide plane, namely 1. If the\nobstacles\nin the real solid were arranged\nin the perfect\nsquare\npattern\nused in the analysis,\nclimb\nof a blocked\ndislocation\nover\none\nrow\nwould\nbe sufficient\nfor\nthe\ndislocation\nto slip past all the subsequent\nrows. However,\nthis deficiency\nof the idealized\nmodel should\nnot be taken\ntoo seriously\nsince in an actual irradiated\nsolid the random\narrangement\nof obstacles\nensures\nthat a mobile dislocation\nwill be stopped\nby obstacles\nafter gliding from its previous\npinning\nposition\na distance\ngiven,\non\nthe average,\nby\nEq. 19.228.\nDetermination\nof the creep\nrate\nis reduced\nto calcu\nlating the obstacle\nheight h and the climb velocity v,.\nWe first\nconsider\nthe situation\nproposed\nby Harkness\net al. 43 in which the obstacles\nto be overcome\nby climb are\nvoids.\nInasmuch\nas\nvoids\nattract\ndislocation\nlines\n(Sec. 18.6),\nthe first\ndislocation\napproaching\nthe row of\nvoids is trapped\nby them,\nin a sequence\nof events similar to\n\nCLIMBING\nDISLOCATIONS\nh\n--\nGLIOE\nA\nh\na\ns\n/\nROW\nOF\nOBSTACLES\n/\n1<\nFig. 19.32\nDislocation\nmotion\nover irradiation-produc~d\nmodel of irradiation\ncreep\nthat shown\nin Fig. 18.22(b)\nexcept\nfor the final pinching\noff (which\ndoes not occur\nhere because\nthe stress\nis less\nthan\nthe yield stress for this process).\nSucceeding\nmobile\ndislocations,\nhowever,\nare repelled\nby the first dislocation\nthat\nhas been sucked\ninto the void row.
