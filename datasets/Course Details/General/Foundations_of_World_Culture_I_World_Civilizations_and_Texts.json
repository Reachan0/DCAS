  "course_name": "Foundations of World Culture I: World Civilizations and Texts",
  "course_description": "This course aims to introduce students to the rich diversity of human culture from antiquity to the early 17th century. In this course, we will explore human culture in its myriad expressions, focusing on the study of literary, religious and philosophical texts as ways of narrating, symbolizing, and commenting on all aspects of human social and material life. We will work comparatively, reading texts from various cultures: Mesopotamian, Greek, Judeo-Christian, Chinese, Indian, and Muslim. Throughout the semester, we will be asking questions like: How have different cultures imagined themselves? What are the rules that they draw up for human behavior? How do they represent the role of the individual in society? How do they imagine ‘universal’ concepts like love, family, duty? How have their writers and artists dealt with encounters with other cultures and other civilizations?",

If you are ill, or have a good reason for missing class, e-mail me--in advance, if possible--to let me know.\n\nYou are expected to prepare yourself for each class by doing the reading for each session in advance. There may be graded drop quizzes, so make sure to keep up with the readings!\n\nAssignments\n\n21L.001X is a HASS-D/CI subject. In this class, CI requirements will be satisfied by\n\nA minimum of 20 pages of writing, in 3-5 assignments\n\nRevision and resubmission of at least one of the assignments\n\nAn oral component (spelled out in the syllabus, i.e. student led discussion, presentation,  etc.)\n\nThis course will be reading and writing-intensive. Each week, you will be required to submit two questions--that you have come up with--to me (via e-mail) that you think will enrich our class discussions the next day.\n\nYou will have three writing assignments. These 7-8 page essays will be based on essay questions that I will hand out in class a week prior to the submission date. You are expected to formulate a coherent argument, and support it with material from the books that you have read (For more information, read the 'Advice on Writing' section. And feel free to ask me).\n\nYou will need to revise one of your first two essays; you may choose which one. When I hand the corrected copies back, you have two days to decide if you'd like to revise it. If you do, we will schedule a meeting to discuss your paper, and work together to make plans for revising it. You will then have a week to submit your revision. You must revise at least one of your first two papers. You cannot submit a re-write without talking to me first.\n\nYou will also be responsible for a brief (15-20 minute) oral presentation on the topic of your choice.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nEssays\n\n75%\n\nClass participation (including oral presentation)\n\n25%\n\nMIT Statement on Plagiarism\n\nPlagiarism--use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement--is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available at the\nWriting and Communication Center\nand the\nMIT Web site on Plagiarism\n.\n\nCalendar\n\nLEC #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh\n, Tablets 1-6\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh\n, Tablets 7-11\n\nThe Odyssey\n, Books 1, 5, 9\n\nThe Odyssey\n, Books 12-14\n\nThe Odyssey\n, Books 18, 19, 24\n\nThe Republic\n, Chapter 4 [Preview with\nGoogle Books\n]\n\nThe Republic\n, Chapter 13\n\n1st essay topics distributed\n\nAristotle, \"Poetics.\" In\nThe Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism\n\nAeschylus, \"Agamemnon.\" In\nThe Oresteia\n\nAeschylus, \"Agamemnon\" (cont.)\n\n1st essay due\n\nOedipus Rex\n\nThe New Oxford Annotated Bible\n, Genesis, Chapters 1-11\n\nThe New Oxford Annotated Bible\n, Chapters 22, 32, 37\n\n1st essay returned\n\nThe New Oxford Annotated Bible\n, The Gospel of Matthew\n\nThe Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation\n, Books 1-4\n\nThe Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation\n, Books 5-12\n\nThe Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation\n, Books 13-20\n\nWhat the Buddha Taught\n, Chapters 1-5\n\nWhat the Buddha Taught\n, Chapters 6-8\n\nWhat the Buddha Taught\n, pp. 91-136\n\nThe Bhagavad-Gita\n, Introduction, Teachings 1-8\n\n2nd essay topics distributed\n\nThe Bhagavad-Gita\n, Teachings 9-18\n\nSelections from\nThe Jataka Tales\n:\n\n\"The Monkey and the Crocodile\"\n\n\"How the Turtle Saved his own Life\"\n\n\"The Foolish, Timid Rabbit\"\n\n\"The Wise and the Foolish Merchant\"\n\n\"The Ox Who Envied the Pig\"\n\n\"The Princes and the Water-Sprite\"\n\n\"Why the Owl is not the King of the Birds\"\n\nSelections from\nthe Qur'an\n:\n\nSura 1, \"The Opening\"\n\nSura 13, \"Thunder\"\n\nSura 96, \"The Blood Clot\"\n\n2nd essay due\n\nSelections from\nthe Qur'an\n:\n\nSura 2, \"The Cow\"\n\nSura 3, \"The House of 'Imran\"\n\nSura 16, \"The Bees\"\n\nThe Divine Comedy\n, Selections from\nBook 3 Hell (Inferno)\n, Cantos 1-3, 5, 25-28, 32-34\n\n2nd essay returned\n\nThe Divine Comedy\n, Selections from\nBook 2 Purgatory(Purgatorio)\n, Cantos 1, 5, 10, 11, 30, 33\n\nThe Divine Comedy\n, Selections from\nBook 1 Paradise (Parasdiso)\n, Cantos 1, 2, 9, 18-20, 31-33\n\nThe Ramayana\n, Chapters 1-4\n\nThe Ramayana\n, Chapters 5-10\n\nThe Ramayana\n, Chapters 11-14\n\nFinal essay topics distributed\n\nThe Arabian Nights\n, Prologue, Nights 1-14\n\nThe Arabian Nights\n, Nights 102-110\n\nDon Quixote\n, selections from Part 1: Chapters 1-5, 7-10, 16-19\n\nFinal essay due\n\nDon Quixote\n, selections from Part 2: Chapters 1-7, 10-14, 42-45, 72-74\n\nWrap up day",
