  "course_name": "Calculus Revisited: Complex Variables, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra",
  "course_description": "Calculus Revisited is a series of videos and related resources that covers the materials normally found in freshman- and sophomore-level introductory mathematics courses. Complex Variables, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra is the third course in the series, consisting of 20 Videos, 3 Study Guides, and a set of Supplementary Notes. Students should have mastered the first two courses in the series (Single Variable Calculus and Multivariable Calculus) before taking this course.\nThe series was first released in 1972, but equally valuable today for students who are learning these topics for the first time.\nAbout the Instructor\nHerb Gross has taught math as senior lecturer at MIT and was the founding math department chair at Bunker Hill Community College. He is the developer of the Mathematics As A Second Language website, providing arithmetic and algebra materials to elementary and middle school teachers.\nAcknowledgements\nFunding for this resource was provided by the Gabriella and Paul Rosenbaum Foundation.\nOther Resources by Herb Gross\nCalculus Revisited: Single Variable Calculus \nCalculus Revisited: Multivariable Calculus",
