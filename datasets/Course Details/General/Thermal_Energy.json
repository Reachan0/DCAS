E., Borgnakke, C, and Van Wylen, G. J., John Wiley Publishers, 1998 (referred to in lecture outline as\nSB & VW\n).\n\nGE Design Project\n\nA design project related to gas turbine engines will be conducted with GE Aircraft Engines. Teams of 4 to 5 students will be formed and the workload will be equivalent to about two problem sets. The deliverables are a written report and the presentation of the work to a GE review committee. The best two teams will be awarded a prize and the GE project will count as two problem sets.\n\nHomework, Quizzes, and Final Exam\n\nThere will be two quizzes during the term plus a final exam. The homework (including reading assignments plus the GE design project) will count 35%, the quizzes will count 15% each, and the final exam will count 30%. The instructor reserves the right to alter the percentages slightly, depending on circumstances.\n\nEach week, the 12 course hours are intended to be distributed approximately as follows:\n\n3 hours of lecture, 1 hour of recitation, 2-3 hours of reading and reviewing notes, 5-6 hours of homework.\n\nHomework assignments will be due at the beginning of class. Any unexcused late assignments will receive zero credit.\n\nThe remaining 5% of the grade will be based on student performance in various exercises (many of which will occur in class). These may include answering questions in class, either verbally or using the PRS system, submitting assessment surveys, or taking concept quizzes. In all cases the lowest 20% of the scores can be dropped to provide some flexibility for missed classes, etc. There will be no make-up opportunities granted for missing these activities.\n\n[Note: A student's performance on quizzes is an assessment of individual performance (versus that of a study group, for example). Therefore if an individual's performance on the quizzes is significantly lower than on the homework, the average quiz grade may be given proportionally greater weight than described above.]\n\nThe basis for grading in the course is as described in the Rules of the MIT Faculty. The description of grades is given below under Basis for Grades.\n\nClass Exercises\n\nThe lectures are thrice a week. Each session is for one hour. These are the primary presentation of the subject material by the instructor.\n\nThere is a recitation once a week for one hour. The recitations will be given by (at different times) the graduate TA and the undergraduate TAs. The recitations review the material from previous lectures and introduce relevant examples, which may be related to the assigned homework.\n\nAs in Unified, attendance at lectures and recitations is considered mandatory. Although no formal roll call will be taken, participation during in-class exercises will represent part of your grade.\n\nQuiz Help Sessions\n\nIt is planned there will be help sessions given by the instructor prior to each quiz and to the final.\n\nPRS System\n\nEach student will be distributed a remote transmitter to be used with the Personal Response System (PRS). Each one has its own number and is assigned to a particular student. Students are responsible for bringing their transmitter to every lecture, in order to participate in exercises that use PRS. Since class participation will be, in part, gauged by each student's responses, operating other student's transmitters in their place will be considered a violation of MIT's academic honesty policy.\n\nThe transmitters cost approximately $50. If a transmitter is lost the student will be responsible for paying for a replacement.\n\nPolicy on Collaboration and Cheating\n\nThe policy on collaboration and cheating will be the same as that specified in Unified Engineering. The policy on Academic Honesty and Study Group Guidelines are given below.\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nThe fundamental principle of academic integrity is that you must fairly represent the authorship of the intellectual content of the work you submit for credit. In the context of this class, this means that if you consult with others (such as fellow students, TA's, faculty) in the process of completing homework, you must acknowledge their contribution in any way that reflects their true ownership of the ideas and methods you borrowed.\n\nDiscussion among students to understand the homework problems or to prepare for laboratories or quizzes is encouraged. COLLABORATION ON HOMEWORK IS ALLOWED AS LONG AS ALL REFERENCES (BOTH LITERATURE AND PEOPLE) USED ARE NAMED CLEARLY AT THE END OF THE ASSIGNMENT. Word-by-word copies of someone else's solution or parts of a solution handed in for credit will be considered cheating unless there is a reference to the source for any part of the work which was copied verbatim. FAILURE TO CITE OTHER STUDENT'S CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR HOMEWORK SOLUTION WILL BE CONSIDERED CHEATING. The official Institute policy regarding academic honesty can be found in the MIT Bulletin Course and Degrees Issue under \"Academic Procedures and Institute Regulations.\"\n\nMIT's academic honesty policy can be found at the following link:\nhttps://policies-procedures.mit.edu/academic-misconduct-and-dishonesty/\n\nStudy Group Guidelines\n\nStudy groups are considered an educationally beneficial activity. However, at the end of each problem on which you collaborated with another student you must cite the students and the interaction. The purpose of this is to acknowledge their contribution to your work. Some examples follow:\n\nYou discuss concepts, approaches and methods that could be applied to a homework problem before either of you start your written solution. This process is encouraged. You are not required to make a written acknowledgment of this type of interaction.\n\nAfter working on a problem independently, you compare answers with another student, which confirms your solution. You should acknowledge that the other student's solution was used to check your own. No credit will be lost if the solutions are correct and the acknowledgments is made.\n\nAfter working on a problem independently, you compare answers with another student, which alerts you to an error in your own work. You should state at the end of the problem that you corrected your error on the basis of checking answers with the other student. No credit will be lost if the solution is correct and the acknowledgment is made, and no direct copying of the correct solution is involved.\n\nYou and another student work through a problem together exchanging ideas as the solution progresses. Each of you should state at the end of the problem that you worked jointly. No credit will be lost if the solutions are correct and the acknowledgment is made.\n\nYou copy all or part of a solution from a reference such as a textbook or a \"bible.\" You should cite the reference. Partial credit will be given, since there is some educational value in reading and understanding the solution. However, this practice is strongly discouraged, and should be used only when you are unable to solve the problem without assistance.\n\nYou copy verbatim all or part of a solution from another student. This process is prohibited. You will receive no credit for verbatim copying from another student when you have not made any intellectual contribution to the work you are both submitting for credit.\n\nVERBATIM COPYING OF ANY MATERIAL WHICH YOU SUBMIT FOR CREDIT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE SOURCE IS CONSIDERED TO BE ACADEMICALLY DISHONEST.\n\nBasis for Grades\n\nThe rules of the MIT faculty define grades in terms of the degree of the mastery of course material:\n\nA\nExceptionally good performance, demonstrating a superior understanding of the subject matter, a foundation of extensive knowledge, and a skillful use of concepts and/or materials.\n\nB\nGood performance, demonstrating capacity to use the appropriate concepts, a good understanding of the subject matter, and an ability to handle the problems and materials encountered in the subject.\n\nC\nAdequate performance, demonstrating an adequate understanding of the subject matter, an ability to handle relatively simple problems, and adequate preparation for moving on to more advanced work in the field.\n\nD\nMinimally acceptable performance, demonstrating at least partial familiarity with the subject matter and some capacity to deal with relatively simple problems, but also demonstrating deficiencies serious enough to make it inadvisable to proceed further in the field without additional work.",

A system undergoes a reversible cycle while exchanging heat with three thermal\nreservoirs, as shown below. Compute the magnitude and direction of Q3 and W.\n2. A tank contains 2 kg of nitrogen at 100 K with a quality of 50%. Through a valve, 0.5\nkg is now removed while the temperature remains constant. Find the final quality\ninside the tank and the volume of nitrogen removed if the valve is located at:\na) the top of the tank,\nb) the bottom of the tank.\nHint: a table for saturated nitrogen is given on page 5.\n3.

Hydrogen and oxygen in gaseous form flow into a combustion chamber and react\nwith each other to produce H2O, also in gaseous form. The flow rate of oxygen is 1\nkmol/second and the proportions of the hydrogen and oxygen are such that all the\nincoming gas is involved in the reaction. The temperature of the reactants entering\nthe combustion chamber is 298 K.\na) What is the equation that describes the reaction?\nb) Assuming that all gases involved in the reaction can be considered perfect,\nwhat is the adiabatic flame temperature?\nc) If the maximum temperature that can be tolerated in the combustion\nchamber is 1798 K, what is the rate at which heat would have to be removed\nfrom the combustion chamber?\nUseful Information:\nThe enthalpy of formation for H2O is\n,\no\nf H O\nh\n=-242,000 kJ/kmol and the specific heats\ncan be approximated as follows:\n\ncP for H2 and O2 can both be taken as constant and equal to 30 kJ/kmol-K\ncP for H2O can be taken as constant and equal to 40 kJ/kmol-K\n\n5. The figure below shows a 30-ohm electrical resistor located in an insulated duct\ncarrying a stream of air. At steady state, an electric current of 15 amp passes through\nthe resistor, whose temperature remains constant at 28oC. The air enters the duct at\n15oC, 1 atm and exits at 25oC with a negligible change in pressure. Kinetic and\npotential energy changes can be ignored and the flow in the duct can be considered\nfrictionless. The specific heat of air can be assumed cP = 1000 J/kg-K.\n\na) For the resistor as the system, determine the rate of entropy production, in\nkW/K if the electrical power needed to pass a current through a given\nresistance is P=I2R.\nb) For a control volume enclosing the air in the duct and the resistor, determine\nthe mass flow rate of the air, in kg/s.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nc) Determine the lost work if the current flows for 10 seconds (the amount of\nwork that is unavailable to us).\n\nPage 3 of 6\n\n6. A turbojet engine can be operated with or without afterburning. The cycle is shown\nin the figure below. Operated without an afterburner, it consists of reversible,\nadiabatic compression from 0 to 1, constant pressure burning from 1 to 2, then\nreversible adiabatic expansion through the turbine and the nozzle from 2 to 4, where\nthe pressure at state 4 is atmospheric. The isentropic temperature ratio (T1/T0 where\nT1 is the temperature at the compressor exit and T0 is the atmospheric temperature)\nis τs, which is equal to 2. The ratio of maximum temperature to atmospheric\ntemperature is 10. The kinetic energy changes across the turbine and compressor\ncan be neglected, as can any temperature rise produced in the inlet and diffuser\nahead of the compressor. If necessary, express your answers in terms of T0 and cp.\na) Sketch the non-afterburning cycle in a T-s diagram and label all states.\nb) What is the thermal efficiency of the non-afterburning cycle?\nc) What is the net mechanical work produced per unit mass flow?\nIn the afterburning mode, expansion takes place in the turbine from state 2 to state 3,\nand then the flow is passed through an afterburner where it undergoes constant\npressure combustion from state 3 to state 5. The maximum temperature at the\nafterburner is the same as the maximum temperature at the combustor exit. On\nleaving the afterburner, the flow expands through a nozzle to atmospheric pressure\nat state 6.\nd) Sketch states 3, 5 and 6 in the same T-s diagram.\ne) The afterburner entrance is at the turbine exit. What is the afterburner inlet\ntemperature T3?\nf) The afterburner exit temperature, T5, is the nozzle inlet temperature. What is\nthe nozzle exit temperature, T6?\ng) What is the thermal efficiency of the afterburning engine cycle?\n\nT1/T0 = τs = 2\nTmax/T0 = 10\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n7. In a manufacturing process, a transparent film is being bonded to a substrate as\nshown in the sketch below. To cure the bond at a temperature T0, a radiant source is\nused to provide a heat flux\n(W/m\nq&\n2), all of which is absorbed at the bonded\nsurface (q is completely transmitted in the transparent film).

      "content": "PART 0\nPRELUDE: REVIEW OF \"UNIFIED ENGINEERING\nTHERMODYNAMICS\"\n\n0-1\nPART 0 - PRELUDE: REVIEW OF \"UNIFIED ENGINEERING THERMODYNAMICS\"\n[IAW pp 2-22, 32-41 (see IAW for detailed SB&VW references); VN Chapter 1]\n0.1\nWhat it's All About\nThe focus of thermodynamics in 16.050 is on the production of work, often in the form of\nkinetic energy (for example in the exhaust of a jet engine) or shaft power, from different sources of\nheat. For the most part the heat will be the result of combustion processes, but this is not always the\ncase. The course content can be viewed in terms of a \"propulsion chain\" as shown below, where we\nsee a progression from an energy source to useful propulsive work (thrust power of a jet engine). In\nterms of the different blocks, the thermodynamics in Unified Engineering and in this course are\nmainly about how to progress from the second block to the third, but there is some examination of\nthe processes represented by the other arrows as well. The course content, objectives, and lecture\noutline are described in detail in Handout #1.\n0.2 Definitions and Fundamental Ideas of Thermodynamics\nAs with all sciences, thermodynamics is concerned with the mathematical modeling of the\nreal world. In order that the mathematical deductions are consistent, we need some precise\ndefinitions of the basic concepts.\nA continuum is a smoothed-out model of matter, neglecting the fact that real substances are\ncomposed of discrete molecules. Classical thermodynamics is concerned only with continua. If\nwe wish to describe the properties of matter at a molecular level, we must use the techniques of\nstatistical mechanics and kinetic theory.\nA closed system is a fixed quantity of matter around which we can draw a boundary. Everything\noutside the boundary is the surroundings. Matter cannot cross the boundary of a closed system\nand hence the principle of the conservation of mass is automatically satisfied whenever we employ\na closed system analysis.\nThe thermodynamic state of a system is defined by the value of certain properties of that system.\nFor fluid systems, typical properties are pressure, volume and temperature. More complex systems\nmay require the specification of more unusual properties. As an example, the state of an electric\nbattery requires the specification of the amount of electric charge it contains.\nProperties may be extensive or intensive. Extensive properties are additive. Thus, if the system is\ndivided into a number of sub-systems, the value of the property for the whole system is equal to\nthe sum of the values for the parts. Volume is an extensive property. Intensive properties do not\ndepend on the quantity of matter present. Temperature and pressure are intensive properties.\nSpecific properties are extensive properties per unit mass and are denoted by lower case letters.\nFor example:\nspecific volume = V/m = v.\nEnergy source\nchemical\nnuclear, etc.\nHeat\n(combustion\nprocess)\nMechanical\nwork,\nelectric power...\nUseful propulsive\nwork (thrust\npower)\n\n0-2\nSpecific properties are intensive because they do not depend on the mass of the system,\nA simple system is a system having uniform properties throughout. In general, however,\nproperties can vary from point to point in a system. We can usually analyze a general system by\nsub-dividing it (either conceptually or in practice) into a number of simple systems in each of\nwhich the properties are assumed to be uniform.\nIf the state of a system changes, then it is undergoing a process. The succession of states through\nwhich the system passes defines the path of the process. If, at the end of the process, the\nproperties have returned to their original values, the system has undergone a cyclic process. Note\nthat although the system has returned to its original state, the state of the surroundings may have\nchanged.\nMuddy points\nSpecific properties (MP 0.1)\nWhat is the difference between extensive and intensive properties? (MP 0.2)\n0.3 Review of Thermodynamic Concepts\nThe following is a brief discussion of some of the concepts introduced in Unified\nEngineering, which we will need in 16.050. Several of these will be further amplified in the\nlectures and in other handouts. If you need additional information or examples concerning these\ntopics, they are described clearly and in-depth in the Unified Notes of Professor Waitz, where\ndetailed references to the relevant sections of the text (SB&VW) are given. They are also covered,\nalthough in a less detailed manner, in Chapters 1 and 2 of the book by Van Ness.\n1)\nThermodynamics can be regarded as a generalization of an enormous body of empirical\nevidence. It is extremely general, and there are no hypotheses made concerning the structure\nand type of matter that we deal with.\n2)\nThermodynamic system\n:\nA quantity of matter of fixed identity. Work or heat (see below) can be transferred across\nthe system boundary, but mass cannot.\nGas, Fluid\nSystem\nBoundary\n3)\nThermodynamic properties :\nFor engineering purposes, we want \"averaged\" information, i.e., macroscopic not\nmicroscopic (molecular) description. (Knowing the position and velocity of each of 1020+\nmolecules that we meet in typical engineering applications is generally not useful.)\n4)\nState of a system\n:\nThe thermodynamic state is defined by specifying values of a (small) set of measured\nproperties which are sufficient to determine all the remaining properties.\n\n0-3\n5)\nEquilibrium :\nThe state of a system in which properties have definite (unchanged) values as long as\nexternal conditions are unchanged is called an equilibrium state. Properties (P, pressure, T,\ntemperature, ρ, density) describe states only when the system is in equilibrium.\nMg + PoA = PA\nGas at\nPressure, P\nMass\nMechanical\nEquilibrium\nPo\nInsulation\nCopper Partition\nThermal Equilibrium\nGas\nT1\nOver time, T1 → T2\nGas\nT2\n6)\nEquations of state:\nFor a simple compressible substance (e.g., air, water) we need to know two properties to set\nthe state. Thus:\nP = P(v,T), or v = v(P, T), or T = T(P,v)\nwhere v is the volume per unit mass, 1/ρ.\nAny of these is equivalent to an equation f(P,v,T) = 0 which is known as an equation of state. The\nequation of state for an ideal gas, which is a very good approximation to real gases at conditions\nthat are typically of interest for aerospace applications is:\nPv- = RT,\nwhere v- is the volume per mol of gas and R is the \"Universal Gas Constant\", 8.31 kJ/kmol-K.\nA form of this equation which is more useful in fluid flow problems is obtained if we\ndivide by the molecular weight, M:\nPv = RT, or P = ρRT\nwhere R is R/M, which has a different value for different gases. For air at room conditions, R is\n0.287 kJ/kg-K.\n7)\nQuasi-equilibrium processes:\nA system in thermodynamic equilibrium satisfies:\na) mechanical equilibrium (no unbalanced forces)\nb) thermal equilibrium (no temperature differences)\nc) chemical equilibrium.\nFor a finite, unbalanced force, the system can pass through non-equilibrium states. We wish to\ndescribe processes using thermodynamic coordinates, so we cannot treat situations in which such\nimbalances exist. An extremely useful idealization, however, is that only \"infinitesimal\"\nunbalanced forces exist, so that the process can be viewed as taking place in a series of \"quasi-\nequilibrium\" states. (The term quasi can be taken to mean \"as if\"; you will see it used in a number\nof contexts such as quasi-one-dimensional, quasi-steady, etc.) For this to be true the process must\nbe slow in relation to the time needed for the system to come to equilibrium internally. For a gas\n\n0-4\nat conditions of interest to us, a given molecule can undergo roughly 10\n10 molecular collisions per\nsecond, so that, if ten collisions are needed to come to equilibrium, the equilibration time is on the\norder of 10-9 seconds. This is generally much shorter than the time scales associated with the bulk\nproperties of the flow (say the time needed for a fluid particle to move some significant fraction of\nthe lighten of the device of interest). Over a large range of parameters, therefore, it is a very good\napproximation to view the thermodynamic processes as consisting of such a succession of\nequilibrium states.\n8)\nReversible process\nFor a simple compressible substance,\nWork = ∫PdV.\nIf we look at a simple system, for example a cylinder of gas and a piston, we see that there can be\ntwo pressures, Ps, the system pressure and Px, the external pressure.\nPs\nPx\nThe work done by the system on the environment is\nWork = ∫PxdV.\nThis can only be related to the system properties if Px ≈ Ps. For this to occur, there cannot be any\nfriction, and the process must also be slow enough so that pressure differences due to accelerations\nare not significant.\nWork during an\nirreversible process = ∫Ps dV\n∫PxdV = 0 but ∫Ps dV = 0\nPs (V)\nPx with friction\nP\nVs\n➀\n➀\n➀\n➁\n➁\nUnder these conditions, we say that the process is reversible. The conditions for reversibility are\nthat:\na) If the process is reversed, the system and the surroundings will be returned to the\noriginal states.\nb) To reverse the process we need to apply only an infinitesimal dP. A reversible process\ncan be altered in direction by infinitesimal changes in the external conditions (see Van\nNess, Chapter 2).\n9)\nWork:\nFor simple compressible substances in reversible processes , the work done by the system\non the environment is ∫PdV. This can be represented as the area under a curve in a Pressure-\nvolume diagram:\n\n0-5\nP\nVolume\nWork is area under curve of P(V)\nV1\nV2\nW1-2\n=\nP\nWork depends on the path\nV\nI\nI\nII\nW1-2\nII\na) Work is path dependent;\nb) Properties only depend on states;\nc) Work is not a property, not a state variable;\nd) When we say W1-2, the work between states 1 and 2, we need to specify the path;\ne) For irreversible (non-reversible) processes, we cannot use ∫PdV; either the work must\nbe given or it must be found by another method.\nMuddy points\nHow do we know when work is done? (MP 0.3)\n10)\nHeat\nHeat is energy transferred due to temperature differences.\na) Heat transfer can alter system states;\nb) Bodies don't \"contain\" heat; heat is identified as it comes across system boundaries;\nc) The amount of heat needed to go from one state to another is path dependent;\nd) Heat and work are different modes of energy transfer;\ne) Adiabatic processes are ones in which no heat is transferred.\n11)\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics\nFor a system,\n∆E\nQ\nW\n=\n-\nE is the energy of the system,\nQ is the heat input to the system, and\nW is the work done by the system.\nE = U (thermal energy) + Ekinetic + Epotential + ....\nIf changes in kinetic and potential energy are not important,\nW\nQ\nU\n-\n=\n∆\n.\na) U arises from molecular motion.\nb) U is a function of state, and thus ∆U is a function of state (as is ∆E).\nc) Q and W are not functions of state.\nComparing (b) and (c) we have the striking result that:\nd) ∆U is independent of path even though Q and W are not!\n\n0-6\nMuddy points\nWhat are the conventions for work and heat in the first law? (MP 0.4)\nWhen does E->U? (MP 0.5)\n12)\nEnthalpy:\nA useful thermodynamic property, especially for flow processes, is the enthalpy. Enthalpy\nis usually denoted by H, or h for enthalpy per unit mass, and is defined by:\nH = U + PV.\nIn terms of the specific quantities, the enthalpy per unit mass is\nh = u + Pv =u\nP\n+\n/ρ.\n13)\nSpecific heats - relation between temperature change and heat input\nFor a change in state between two temperatures, the \"specific heat\" is:\nSpecific heat = Q/(Tfinal - Tinitial)\nWe must, however, specify the process, i.e., the path, for the heat transfer. Two useful processes\nare constant pressure and constant volume. The specific heat at constant pressure is denoted as Cp\nand that at constant volume as Cv, or cp and cv per unit mass.\nc\nh\nT\nc\nu\nT\np\np\nv\nv\n=\n\n=\n\n∂\n∂\n∂\n∂\nand\nFor an ideal gas\ndh = cpdT and du = cvdT.\nThe ratio of specific heats, cp/cv is denoted by γ. This ratio is 1.4 for air at room conditions.\nThe specific heats cv. and cp have a basic definition as derivatives of the energy and enthalpy.\nSuppose we view the internal energy per unit mass, u, as being fixed by specification of\nT, the temperature and v, the specific volume, i.e., the volume per unit mass. (For a simple\ncompressible substance, these two variables specify the state of the system.) Thus,\nu = u(T,v).\nThe difference in energy between any two states separated by small temperature and specific volume\ndifferences, dT and dv is\n\ndu = ∂u\n∂T v\ndT + ∂u\n∂v T\ndv\nThe derivative\n\n∂u ∂T\n∂u ∂T v represents the slope of a line of constant v on a u-T plane. The derivative is\nalso a function of state, i. e., a thermodynamic property, and is called the specific heat at constant\nvolume, cv.\nThe name specific heat is perhaps unfortunate in that only for special circumstances is the\nderivative related to energy transfer as heat. If a process is carried out slowly at constant volume, no\nwork will be done and any energy increase will be due only to energy transfer as heat. For such a\n\n0-7\nprocess, cv does represent the energy increase per unit of temperature (per unit of mass) and\nconsequently has been called the \"specific heat at constant volume\". However, it is more useful to\nthink of cv in terms of its definition as a certain partial derivative, which is a thermodynamic\nproperty, rather than a quantity related to energy transfer as heat in the special constant volume\nprocess.\nThe enthalpy is also a function of state. For a simple compressible substance we can regard\nthe enthalpy as a function of T and P, that is view the temperature and pressure as the two variables\nthat define the state. Thus,\nh = h(T,P).\nTaking the differential,\n\ndh = ∂h\n∂T P\ndT + ∂h\n∂P T\ndP\nThe derivative\n\n∂h ∂T\n∂h ∂T P is called the specific heat at constant pressure, denoted by cp.\nThe derivatives cv and cp constitute two of the most important thermodynamic derivative\nfunctions. Values of these properties have been experimentally determined as a function of the\nthermodynamic state for an enormous number of simple compressible substances.\n14) Ideal Gases\nThe equation of state for an ideal gas is\nPV = NRT,\nwhere N is the number of moles of gas in the volume V. Ideal gas behavior furnishes an extremely\ngood approximation to the behavior of real gases for a wide variety of aerospace applications. It\nshould be remembered, however, that describing a substance as an ideal gas constitutes a model of\nthe actual physical situation , and the limits of model validity must always be kept in mind.\nOne of the other important features of an ideal gas is that its internal energy depends only\nupon its temperature. (For now, this can be regarded as another aspect of the model of actual\nsystems that the perfect gas represents, but it can be shown that this is a consequence of the form of\nthe equation of state.) Since u depends only on T,\ndu = cv (T)dT\nIn the above equation we have indicated that cv can depend on T.\nLike the internal energy, the enthalpy is also only dependent on T for an ideal gas. (If u is a\nfunction of T, then, using the perfect gas equation of state, u + Pv is also.) Therefore,\ndh = cP(T)dT.\nFurther, dh = du + d(Pv) = cv dT + R dT. Hence, for an ideal gas,\ncv = cP - R.\nIn general, for other substances, u and h depend on pressure as well as on temperature. In this\nrespect, the ideal gas is a very special model.\n\n0-8\nThe specific heats do not vary greatly over wide ranges in temperature, as shown in VWB&S\nFigure 5.11. It is thus often useful to treat them as constant. If so\nu2 - u1 = cv (T2 - T1)\nh2 - h1 = cp (T2 - T1)\nThese equations are useful in calculating internal energy or enthalpy differences, but it should be\nremembered that they hold only for an ideal gas with constant specific heats.\nIn summary, the specific heats are thermodynamic properties and can be used even if the\nprocesses are not constant pressure or constant volume. The simple relations between changes in\nenergy (or enthalpy) and temperature are a consequence of the behavior of an ideal gas, specifically\nthe dependence of the energy and enthalpy on temperature only, and are not true for more complex\nsubstances.\nAdapted from \"Engineering Thermodynamics\", Reynolds, W. C and Perkins, H. C,\nMcGraw-Hill Publishers\n15) Specific Heats of an Ideal Gas\n1. All ideal gases:\n(a)\nThe specific heat at constant volume (cv for a unit mass or CV for one kmol) is a function of T\nonly.\n(b)\nThe specific heat at constant pressure (cp for a unit mass or CP for one kmol) is a function of T\nonly.\n(c)\nA relation that connects the specific heats cp, cv, and the gas constant is\ncp - cv = R\nwhere the units depend on the mass considered. For a unit mass of gas, e. g., a kilogram, cp\nand cv would be the specific heats for one kilogram of gas and R is as defined above. For one\nkmol of gas, the expression takes the form:\nCP - CV = R,\nwhere CP and CV have been used to denote the specific heats for one kmol of gas and R is the\nuniversal gas constant.\n(d)\nThe specific heat ratio, γ, = cp/cv (or CP/CV), is a function of T only and is greater than unity.\n2. Monatomic gases, such as He, Ne, Ar, and most metallic vapors:\n(a)\ncv (or CV) is constant over a wide temperature range and is very nearly equal to (3/2)R [or\n(3/2)R , for one kmol].\n(b)\ncp (or CP) is constant over a wide temperature range and is very nearly equal to (5/2)R [or\n(5/2)R , for one kmol].\n(c)\nγ is constant over a wide temperature range and is very nearly equal to 5/3 [γ = 1.67].\n\n0-9\n3. So-called permanent diatomic gases, namely H2, O2, N2, Air, NO, and CO:\n(a)\ncv (or CV ) is nearly constant at ordinary temperatures, being approximately (5/2)R [(5/2)R ,\nfor one kmol], and increases slowly at higher temperatures.\n(b)\ncp (or CP ) is nearly constant at ordinary temperatures, being approximately (7/2)R [(7/2)R ,\nfor one kmol], and increases slowly at higher temperatures.\n(c)\nγ is constant over a temperature range of roughly 150 to 600K and is very nearly equal to 7/5\n[γ = 1.4]. It decreases with temperature above this.\n4. Polyatomic gases and gases that are chemically active, such as CO2, NH3, CH4, and Freons:\nThe specific heats, cv and cp, and γ vary with the temperature, the variation being different for each\ngas. The general trend is that heavy molecular weight gases (i.e., more complex gas molecules than\nthose listed in 2 or 3), have values of γ closer to unity than diatomic gases, which, as can be seen\nabove, are closer to unity than monatomic gases. For example, values of γ below 1.2 are typical of\nFreons which have molecular weights of over one hundred.\nAdapted from Zemansky, M. W. and Dittman, R.

We wish to know the relation between properties\nupstream of the valve, denoted by \"1\" and those downstream, denoted by \"2\".\n\n0-10\nFigure 0-1: Adiabatic flow through a valve, a generic throttling process\nTo analyze this situation, we can define the system (choosing the appropriate system is often a\ncritical element in effective problem solving) as a unit mass of gas in the following two states.\nInitially the gas is upstream of the valve and just through the valve as indicated. In the final state\nthe gas is downstream of the valve plus just through the valve. The figures on the left show the\nactual configuration just described. In terms of the system behavior, however, we could replace\nthe fluid external to the system by pistons which exert the same pressure that the external fluid\nexerts, as indicated schematically on the right side of Figure 0-2 below.\nFigure 0-2: Equivalence of actual system and piston model\nThe process is adiabatic, with changes in potential energy and kinetic energy assumed to be\nnegligible.

For\nthe case examined, since we are dealing with a unit mass, the initial final states of the system have\nthe same value of u+Pv.\nP1, v1, u1...\nP2, v2, u2...\nsystem\nsystem\n=\n=\npistons\npistons\nInitial\nstate\nFinal\nstate\nValve\n\n0-11\nMuddy points\nWhen is enthalpy the same in initial and final states? (MP 0.6)\nb) Another example of a flow process, this time for an unsteady flow, is the transient process of\nfilling a tank, initially evacuated, from a surrounding atmosphere, which is at a pressure P0 and a\ntemperature T0. The configuration is shown in Figure 0-3.\nFigure 0-3: A transient problem--filling of a tank from the atmosphere\nAt a given time, the valve at the tank inlet is opened and the outside air rushes in. The\ninflow stops when the pressure inside is equal to the pressure outside. The tank is insulated, so\nthere is no heat transfer to the atmosphere. What is the final temperature of the gas in the tank?\nThis time we take the system to be all the gas that enters the tank. The initial state has the\nsystem completely outside the tank, and the final state has the system completely inside the tank.\nThe kinetic energy initially and in the final state is negligible, as is the change in potential energy\nso the first law again takes the form,\nW\nU\n-\n=\n∆\n.\nWork is done on the system, of magnitude\n0V\nP\n, where V0 is the initial volume of the system, so\n0V\nP\nU =\n∆\n.\nIn terms of quantities per unit mass (\nu\nm\nU\n∆\n=\n∆\n,\nmv\nV =\n, where m is the mass of the system),\n0v\nP\nu\nu\nu\ni\nfinal\n=\n-\n=\n∆\n.\nThe final value of the internal energy is\n.\n\nh\nh\nv\nP\nu\nu\ni\ni\nfinal\n=\n=\n+\n=\nFor a perfect gas with constant specific heats,\nT\nc\nh\nT\nc\nu\np\nv\n=\n=\n;\n,\n0T\nc\nT\nc\np\nfinal\nv\n=\n,\nV0\nSystem\n(all the gas that goes\ninto the tank)\nP0\nVacuum\nP0 ,T0\nValve\n\n0-12\nT\nT\nc\nc\nT\nv\np\nfinal\nγ\n=\n=\n.\nThe final temperature is thus roughly 200oF hotter than the outside air!\nIt may be helpful to recap what we used to solve this problem. There were basically four steps:\n1 Definition of the system\n2 Use of the first law\n3 Equating the work to a \"PdV\" term\n4 Assuming the fluid to be a perfect gas with constant specific heats.\nA message that can be taken from both of these examples (as well as from a large number\nof other more complex situations, is that the quantity h = u + Pv occurs naturally in problems of\nfluid flow. Because the combination appears so frequently, it is not only defined but also tabulated\nas a function of temperature and pressure for a number of working fluids.\nMuddy points\nIn the filling of a tank, why (physically) is the final temperature in the tank higher than\nthe initial temperature? (MP 0.7)\n18) Control volume form of the system laws (Waitz pp 32-34, VWB&S, 6.1, 6.2)\nThe thermodynamic laws (as well as Newton's laws) are for a system, a specific quantity of\nmatter. More often, in propulsion and power problems, we are interested in what happens in a\nfixed volume, for example a rocket motor or a jet engine through which mass is flowing. For this\nreason, the control volume form of the system laws is of great importance. A schematic of the\ndifference is shown below. Rather than focus on a particle of mass which moves through the\nengine, it is more convenient to focus on the volume occupied by the engine. This requires us to\nuse the control volume form of the thermodynamic laws.\nFigure 0-4: Control volume and system for flow through a propulsion device\nThe first of these is conservation of mass. For the control volume shown, the rate of\nchange of mass inside the volume is given by the difference between the mass flow rate in and the\nmass flow rate out. For a single flow coming in and a single flow coming out this is\nout\nin\nCV\nm\nm\ndt\ndm\n-\n-\n-\n=\n.\nIf the mass inside the control volume changes with time it is because some mass is added or some\nis taken out.\nThe first law of thermodynamics can be written as a rate equation:\n-\n-\n-\n=\nW\nQ\ndt\ndE\n.\nTo derive the first law as a rate equation for a control volume we proceed as with the mass\nconservation equation. The physical idea is that any rate of change of energy in the control\nSystem at time tf\nEngine\nSystem at ti\n\n0-13\nvolume must be caused by the rates of energy flow into or out of the volume. The heat transfer\nand the work are already included and the only other contribution must be associated with the mass\nflow in and out, which carries energy with it. The figure below shows a schematic of this idea.\ndEcv\ndt\nWboundary\n⋅\nWshaft\n⋅\nme\nPe Te\nve ee\nPi Ti\nvi ei\n⋅\nQ⋅\nmi⋅\nFigure 0-5: Schematic diagram illustrating terms in the energy equation for a control volume\nThe fluid that enters or leaves has an amount of energy per unit mass given by\ngz\nc\nu\ne\n+\n+\n=\n/\n,\nwhere c is the fluid velocity. In addition, whenever fluid enters or leaves a control volume there is\na work term associated with the entry or exit. We saw this in example 16a, and the present\nderivation is essentially an application of the ideas presented there. Flow exiting at station \"e\"\nmust push back the surrounding fluid, doing work on it. Flow entering the volume at station \"i\" is\npushed on by, and receives work from the surrounding air. The rate of flow work at exit is given\nby the product of the pressure times the exit area times the rate at which the external flow is\n\"pushed back\". The last of these, however, is equal to the volume per unit mass times the rate of\nmass flow. Put another way, in a time dt, the work done on the surroundings by the flow at the exit\nstation is\ne\nflow\nPvdm\ndW\n=\n.\nThe net rate of flow work is\ni\ni\ni\ne\ne\ne\nflow\nm\nv\nP\nm\nv\nP\nW\n&\n& -\n=\n.\nIncluding all possible energy flows (heat, shaft work, shear work, piston work etc.), the\nfirst law can then be written as:\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n)\n(\ngz\nc\nu\nm\nW\nW\nW\nW\nQ\nE\ndt\nd\nflow\npiston\nshear\nshaft\nCV\n&\n&\n&\n&\n&\n&\n\n0-14\nwhere Σ includes the sign associated with the energy flow. If heat is added or work is done on the\nsystem then the sign is positive, if work or heat are extracted from the system then the sign is\nnegative. NOTE: this is consistent with ∆E = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system on\nthe environment, thus work is flowing out of the system.\nWe can then collect the specific energy term e included in Ecv and the specific flow term Pv to\nmake the enthalpy appear:\nTotal energy associated with mass flow:\nth\ngz\nc\nh\nPv\ngz\nc\nu\nPv\ne\n=\n+\n+\n=\n+\n+\n+\n=\n+\n/\n/\n,\nwhere ht is the stagnation enthalpy (IAW, p.36).\nThus, the first law can be written as:\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n)\n(\ngz\nc\nh\nm\nW\nW\nW\nQ\nE\ndt\nd\npiston\nshear\nshaft\nCV\n&\n&\n&\n&\n&\n.\nFor most of the applications done in this course, there will be no shear work and no piston work.\nHence, the first law for a control volume will be most often used as:\n(\n)\n(\n)\ne\ne\ne\ne\ni\ni\ni\ni\nshaft\nCV\nCV\ngz\nc\nh\nm\ngz\nc\nh\nm\nW\nQ\ndt\ndE\n+\n+\n-\n+\n+\n+\n-\n=\n-\n-\n-\n-\n/\n/\n.\nThe rate of work term is the sum of the shaft work and the flow work. In writing the control\nvolume form of the equation we have assumed only one entering and one leaving stream, but this\ncould be generalized to any number of inlet and exit streams.\nMuddy points\nWhat distinguishes shaft work from other works? (MP 0.8)\nFor problems of interest in aerospace applications the velocities are high and the term that\nis associated with changes in the elevation is small.

In this problem the shaft\nwork is zero, and the heat transfer, kinetic energy changes, and potential energy changes are\nneglected.

Their value depends not only on\nthe temperature and pressure but also on \"how much\", i.e., what the mass of the system\nis. The internal energy of two kilograms of air is twice as much as the internal energy of\none kilogram of air. It is very often useful to work in terms of properties that do not\ndepend on the mass of the system, and for this purpose we use the specific volume,\nspecific energy, specific enthalpy, etc., which are the values of volume, energy, and\nenthalpy for a unit mass (kilogram) of the substance. For a system of mass m, the\nrelations between the two quantities are:\nV\nmv\nU\nmu\nH\nmh\n=\n=\n=\n;\n;\n0.2 What is the difference between extensive and intensive properties?\nIntensive properties are properties that do not depend on the quantity of matter. For\nexample, pressure and temperature are intensive properties. Energy, volume and enthalpy\nare all extensive properties. Their value depends on the mass of the system. For example,\nthe enthalpy of a certain mass of a gas is doubled if the mass is doubled; the enthalpy of a\nsystem that consists of several parts is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of the parts.\n0.3 How do we know when work is done?\nA rigorous test for whether work is done or not is whether a weight could have been\nraised in the process under consideration. I will hand out some additional material to\nsupplement the notes on this point, which seems simple, but can be quite subtle to\nunravel in some situations.\n0.4 What are the conventions for work and heat in the first law?\nHeat is positive if it is given to the system. Work is positive if it is done by the system.\n0.5 When does E->U?\nWe deal with changes in energy. When the changes in the other types of energy (kinetic,\npotential, strain, etc) can be neglected compared to the changes in thermal energy, then it\nis a good approximation to use ∆U as representing the total energy change.\n0.6 When is enthalpy the same in initial and final states?\nInitial and final stagnation enthalpy is the same if the flow is steady and if there is no net\nshaft work plus heat transfer. If the change in kinetic energy is negligible, the initial and\nfinal enthalpy is the same. The \"tank problem\" is unsteady so the initial and final\n\nenthalpies are not the same. See the discussion of steady flow energy equation in notes\n[(17) in Section 0].\n0.7 In the filling of a tank, why (physically) is the final temperature in the tank higher\nthan the initial temperature?\nWork is done on the system, which in this problem is the mass of gas that is pushed into\nthe tank.\n0.8 What distinguishes shaft work from other works?\nThe term shaft work arises in using a control volume approach. As we have defined it,\n\"shaft work\" is all work over and above work associated with the \"flow work\" (the work\ndone by pressure forces). Generally this means work done by rotating machinery, which\nis carried by a shaft from the control volume to the outside world. There could also be\nwork over and above the pressure force work done by shear stresses at the boundaries of\nthe control volume, but this is seldom important if the control boundary is normal to the\nflow direction.\nIf we consider a system (a mass of fixed identity, say a blob of gas) flowing through some\ndevice, neglecting the effects of raising or lowering the blob the only mode of work\nwould be the work to compress the blob. This would be true even if the blob were\nflowing through a turbine or compressor. (In doing this we are focusing on the same\nmaterial as it undergoes the unsteady compression or expansion processes in the device,\nrather than looking at a control volume, through which mass passes.)\nThe question about shaft work and non shaft work has been asked several times. I am not\nsure how best to answer, but it appears that the difficulty people are having might be\nassociated with being able to know when one can say that shaft work occurs. There are\nseveral features of a process that produces ( or absorbs) shaft work. First of all, the view\ntaken of the process is one of control volume, rather than control mass (see the discussion\nof control volumes in section 0 or in IAW). Second, there need to be a shaft or equivalent\ndevice ( a moving belt, a row of blades) that can be identified as the work carrier. Third,\nthe shaft work is work over and above the flow work that is done by (or received by) the\nstreams that exit and enter the control volume.\n0.9 Definition of a control volume.\nA control volume is an enclosure that separates a quantity of matter from the\nsurroundings or environment. The enclosure does not necessarily have to consist of a\nsolid boundary like the walls of a vessel. It is only necessary that the enclosure forms a\nclosed surface and that its properties are defined everywhere. An enclosure may transmit\nheat or be a heat insulator. It may be deformable and thus capable of transmitting work to\nthe system. It may also be capable of transmitting mass."

Background to the Second Law of Thermodynamics\n[IAW 23-31 (see IAW for detailed VWB&S references); VN Chapters 2, 3, 4]\n1.A.1 Some Properties of Engineering Cycles; Work and Efficiency\nAs motivation for the development of the second law, we examine two types of processes that\nconcern interactions between heat and work. The first of these represents the conversion of work\ninto heat. The second, which is much more useful, concerns the conversion of heat into work. The\nquestion we will pose is how efficient can this conversion be in the two cases.\nFigure A-1: Examples of the conversion of work into heat\nThree examples of the first process are given above. The first is the pulling of a block on a rough\nhorizontal surface by a force which moves through some distance. Friction resists the pulling.\nAfter the force has moved through the distance, it is removed. The block then has no kinetic\nenergy and the same potential energy it had when the force started to act. If we measured the\ntemperature of the block and the surface we would find that it was higher than when we started.\n(High temperatures can be reached if the velocities of pulling are high; this is the basis of inertia\nwelding.) The work done to move the block has been converted totally to heat.\nThe second example concerns the stirring of a viscous liquid. There is work associated with the\ntorque exerted on the shaft turning through an angle. When the stirring stops, the fluid comes to\nrest and there is (again) no change in kinetic or potential energy from the initial state. The fluid\nand the paddle wheels will be found to be hotter than when we started, however.\nThe final example is the passage of a current through a resistance. This is a case of electrical work\nbeing converted to heat, indeed it models operation of an electrical heater.\nAll the examples in Figure A-1 have 100% conversion of work into heat. This 100% conversion\ncould go on without limit as long as work were supplied. Is this true for the conversion of heat\ninto work?\nTo answer the last question, we need to have some basis for judging whether work is done in a\ngiven process. One way to do this is to ask whether we can construct a way that the process could\nresult in the raising of a weight in a gravitational field. If so, we can say \"Work has been done\". It\nmay sometimes be difficult to make the link between a complicated thermodynamic process and\nthe simple raising of a weight, but this is a rigorous test for the existence of work.\nOne example of a process in which heat is converted to work is the isothermal (constant\ntemperature) expansion of an ideal gas, as sketched in the figure. The system is the gas inside the\nchamber. As the gas expands, the piston does work on some external device. For an ideal gas, the\ninternal energy is a function of temperature only, so that if the temperature is constant for some\nprocess the internal energy change is zero. To keep the temperature constant during the expansion,\ni\nR\n+\n-\nViscous liquid\nBlock on rough surface\nResistive heating\nF\n\n1A-2\nP, T\nQ\nWork received, W\nPatm\nheat must be supplied. Because ∆U = 0, the first\nlaw takes the form Q=W. This is a process that\nhas 100% conversion of heat into work.\nThe work exerted by the system is given by\nWork = PdV\n∫\nwhere 2 and 1 denote the two states at the\nbeginning and end of the process. The equation of\nstate for an ideal gas is\nP = NRT/V,\nwith N the number of moles of the gas contained in the chamber. Using the equation of state, the\nexpression for work can be written as\nWork during an isothermal expansion = NRT dV V\n/\n∫\n= NRTln V\nV\n\n.\n(A.1.1)\nFor an isothermal process, PV = constant, so that P P\nV\nV\n/\n/\n=\n. The work can be written in terms\nof the pressures at the beginning and end as\nWork during an isothermal expansion = NRTln P\nP\n\n.\n(A.1.2)\nThe lowest pressure to which we can expand and still receive work from the system is atmospheric\npressure. Below this, we would have to do work on the system to pull the piston out further.\nThere is thus a bound on the amount of work that can be obtained in the isothermal expansion; we\ncannot continue indefinitely. For a power or propulsion system, however, we would like a source\nof continuous power, in other words a device that would give power or propulsion as long as fuel\nwas added to it. To do this, we need a series of processes where the system does not progress\nthrough a one-way transition from an initial state to a different final state, but rather cycles back to\nthe initial state. What is looked for is in fact a thermodynamic cycle for the system.\nWe define several quantities for a cycle:\nQA is the heat absorbed by the system\nQR is the heat rejected by the system\nW is the net work done by the system.\nThe cycle returns to its initial state, so the overall energy change, ∆U , is zero. The net work done\nby the system is related to the\nmagnitudes of the heat absorbed and the heat rejected by\nW\nQ\nQ\nA\nR\n=\n=\n-\nNet work\n.\nThe thermal efficiency of the cycle is the ratio of the work done to the heat absorbed. (Efficiencies\nare often usefully portrayed as \"What you get\" versus \"What you pay for\". Here what we get is\nwork and what we pay for is heat, or rather the fuel that generates the heat.) In terms of the heat\nabsorbed and rejected, the thermal efficiency is:\nη = thermal efficiency =\nWork done\nHeat absorbed\n=\n-\n= -\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nA\nR\nA\nR\nA\n.\n(A.1.3)\n\n1A-3\nThe thermal efficiency can only be 100% (complete conversion of heat into work) if QR = 0, and a\nbasic question is what is the maximum thermal efficiency for any arbitrary cycle? We examine\nthis for two cases, the Carnot cycle and the Brayton (or Joule) cycle which is a model for the\npower cycle in a jet engine.\n1.A.2 Carnot Cycles\nA Carnot cycle is shown below. It has four processes. There are two adiabatic reversible legs and\ntwo isothermal reversible legs. We can construct a Carnot cycle with many different systems, but\nthe concepts can be shown using a familiar working fluid, the ideal gas. The system can be\nregarded as a chamber filled with this ideal gas and with a piston.\nP\nV\nQ1\nT1\nT2\nT2\nQ2\nQ2\nT1\nQ1\na\nb\nd\nc\nReservoir\nInsulating stand\nReservoir\nFigure A-2: Carnot cycle - thermodynamic diagram on left and schematic of the different stages in\nthe cycle for a system composed of an ideal gas on the right\nThe four processes in the Carnot cycle are:\n1) The system is at temperature T2 at state (a). It is brought in contact with a heat reservoir,\nwhich is just a liquid or solid mass of large enough extent such that its temperature does not\nchange appreciably when some amount of heat is transferred to the system. In other words, the\nheat reservoir is a constant temperature source (or receiver) of heat. The system then\nundergoes an isothermal expansion from a to b, with heat absorbed Q2.\n2) At state b, the system is thermally insulated (removed from contact with the heat reservoir) and\nthen let expand to c. During this expansion the temperature decreases to T1. The heat\nexchanged during this part of the cycle, Qbc = 0.\n3) At state c the system is brought in contact with a heat reservoir at temperature T1. It is then\ncompressed to state d, rejecting heat Q1 in the process.\n4) Finally, the system is compressed adiabatically back to the initial state a. The heat exchange\nQda = 0.\nThe thermal efficiency of the cycle is given by the definition\nη = -\n= +\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nR\nA\n.\n(A.2.1)\nIn this equation, there is a sign convention implied. The quantities Q ,Q\nA\nR as defined are the\nmagnitudes of the heat absorbed and rejected. The quantities Q ,Q\n2 on the other hand are defined\nwith reference to heat received by the system. In this example, the former is negative and the latter\nis positive. The heat absorbed and rejected by the system takes place during isothermal processes\nand we already know what their values are from Eq. (A.1.1):\n\n1A-4\nQ\nWab\n2 =\n=NRT2 ln V\nV\nb\na\n/\n(\n)\n[\n]\nQ\nWcd\n1 =\n= NRT1 ln V\nV\nd\nc\n/\n(\n)\n[\n] = - ln V\nV\nc\nd\n/\n(\n)\n[\n]. (Q1 is negative.)\nThe efficiency can now be written in terms of the volumes at the different states as:\nη =\n+\n(\n)\n[\n]\n(\n)\n[\n]\nT\nV\nV\nT\nV\nV\nd\nc\nb\na\nln\nln\n/\n/\n.\n(A.2.2)\nThe path from states b to c and from a to d are both adiabatic and reversible. For a reversible\nadiabatic process we know that PV γ = constant. Using the ideal gas equation of state, we\nhave TV γ -1= constant. Along curve b-c, therefore T V\nT V\nb\nc\nγ\nγ\n-\n-\n=\n. Along the curve d-a,\nT V\nT V\na\nd\nγ\nγ\n-\n-\n=\n.\nThus,\nV\nV\nT\nT\nT\nT\nV\nV\nd\nc\na\nb\n\n= (\n)\n(\n)\n\n-\n-\nγ\nγ\n/\n/\n, which means that V\nV\nV\nV\nd\nc\na\nb\n=\n, orV\nV\nV\nV\nd\nc\na\nb\n/\n/\n=\n.\nComparing the expression for thermal efficiency Eq. (A.2.1) with Eq. (A.2.2) shows two\nconsequences. First, the heats received and rejected are related to the temperatures of the\nisothermal parts of the cycle by\nQ\nT\nQ\nT\n+\n=\n.\n(A.2.3))\nSecond, the efficiency of a Carnot cycle is given compactly by\nηc\nT\nT\n= -\n.\n\nCarnot cycle efficiency\n(A.2.4)\nThe efficiency can be 100% only if the temperature at which the heat is rejected is zero. The heat\nand work transfers to and from the system are shown schematically in Figure A-3.\nQ2\nQ1\nT1\nW (net work)\nT2\nSystem\nFigure A-3: Work and heat transfers in a Carnot cycle between two heat reservoirs\n\n1A-5\nMuddy points\nSince\n\nη =\n-\nT\nT\n, looking at the P-V graph, does that mean the farther apart the T1, T2\nisotherms are, the greater efficiency? And that if they were very close, it would be very\ninefficient? (MP 1A.1)\nIn the Carnot cycle, why are we only dealing with volume changes and not pressure\nchanges on the adiabats and isotherms? (MP 1A.2)\nIs there a physical application for the Carnot cycle? Can we design a Carnot engine for a\npropulsion device? (MP 1A.3)\nHow do we know which cycles to use as models for real processes? (MP 1A.4)\n1.A.3 Brayton Cycles (or Joule Cycles): The Power Cycle for a Gas Turbine Jet Engine\nFor a Brayton cycle there are two adiabatic legs and two constant pressure legs.

Tracing the path shown around the cycle from a-b-c-d and back to a, the first law gives\n(writing the equation in terms of a unit mass),\n∆u\nq\nq\nw\na b c d a\n----=\n=\n+\n-\n.\nThe net work done is\nw\nq\nq\n=\n+\n1,\nwhere q q\n,\nare defined as heat received by the system (q1 is negative). We thus need to evaluate\nthe heat transferred in processes b-c and d-a.\nFor a constant pressure process the heat exchange per unit mass is\ndh\nc dT\ndq\np\n=\n=\n, or dq\ndh\ncons\nt P\n[\n]\n=\ntan\n.\nThe heat exchange can be expressed in terms of enthalpy differences between the relevant states.\nTreating the working fluid as an ideal gas, for the heat addition from the combustor,\nq\nh\nh\nc\nT\nT\nc\nb\np\nc\nb\n2 =\n-\n=\n-\n(\n).\nThe heat rejected is, similarly, q\nh\nh\nc\nT\nT\na\nd\np\na\nd\n1 =\n-\n=\n-\n(\n).\nThe net work per unit mass is given by\nNet work per unit mass = q\nq\nc\nT\nT\nT\nT\np\nc\nb\na\nd\n+\n=\n-\n(\n) +\n-\n(\n)\n[\n].\nThe thermal efficiency of the Brayton cycle can now be expressed in terms of the temperatures:\n\n1A-7\nη =\n=\n-\n(\n) -\n-\n(\n)\n[\n]\n-\n[\n]\nNet work\nHeat in\nc\nT\nT\nT\nT\nc\nT\nT\np\nc\nb\nd\na\np\nc\nb\n= -\n-\n(\n)\n-\n(\n)\n= -\n-\n(\n)\n-\n(\n)\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT T\nT\nT T\nT\nd\na\nc\nb\na\nd\na\nb\nc\nb\n/\n/\n.\n(A.3.1)\nTo proceed further, we need to examine the relationships between the different temperatures. We\nknow that points a and d are on a constant pressure process as are points b and c,\nand P\nP\nP\nP\na\nd\nb\nc\n=\n=\n;\n. The other two legs of the cycle are adiabatic and reversible, so\nP\nP\nP\nP\nT\nT\nT\nT\nd\nc\na\nb\nd\nc\na\nb\n=\n==\n\n=\n\n-\n(\n)\n-\n(\n)\n\n>\nγ\nγ\nγ\nγ\n/\n/\n.\nTherefore T\nT\nT\nT\nd\nc\na\nb\n=\n, or, finally, T\nT\nT\nT\nd\na\nc\nb\n=\n. Using this relation in the expression for thermal\nefficiency, Eq. (A.1.3) yields an expression for the thermal efficiency of a Brayton cycle:\nIdeal Brayton cycle efficiency:ηB\na\nb\nT\nT\n= -\n(A.3.2)\n= -\nT\nT\natmospheric\ncompressor exit\n\n.\nThe temperature ratio across the compressor, T\nT\nTR\nb\na\n/\n=\n. In terms of compressor temperature\nratio, and using the relation for an adiabatic reversible process we can write the efficiency in terms\nof the compressor (and cycle) pressure ratio, which is the parameter commonly used:\nη\nγ\nγ\nB\nTR\nPR\n= -\n= -\n(\n)\n-\n(\n)\n1 / .\n(A.3.3)\nFigure A-6 shows pressures and temperatures through a gas turbine engine (the afterburning J57,\nwhich powers the F-8 and the F-101).\nFigure A-6: Gas turbine engine pressures and temperatures\n\n1A-8\nEquation (A.3.3) says that for a high cycle efficiency, the pressure ratio of the cycle should be\nincreased. Figure A-7 shows the history of aircraft engine pressure ratio versus entry into service,\nand it can be seen that there has been a large increase in cycle pressure ratio. The thermodynamic\nconcepts apply to the behavior of real aerospace devices!\nFigure A-7: Gas turbine engine pressure ratio trends (Jane's Aeroengines, 1998)\nMuddy points\nWhen flow is accelerated in a nozzle, doesn't that reduce the internal energy of the flow\nand therefore the enthalpy? (MP 1A.5)\nWhy do we say the combustion in a gas turbine engine is constant pressure? (MP 1A.6)\nWhy is the Brayton cycle less efficient than the Carnot cycle? (MP 1A.7)\nIf the gas undergoes constant pressure cooling in the exhaust outside the engine, is that\nstill within the system boundary ? (MP 1A.8)\nDoes it matter what labels we put on the corners of the cycle or not? (MP 1A.9)\nIs the work done in the compressor always equal to the work done in the turbine plus\nwork out (for a Brayton cyle) ? (MP 1A.10)\n1.A.4 Gas Turbine Technology and Thermodynamics\nThe turbine entry temperature, Tc, is fixed by materials technology and cost. (If the temperature is\ntoo high, the blades fail.) Figures A-8 and A-9 show the progression of the turbine entry\ntemperatures in aeroengines. Figure A-8 is from Rolls Royce and Figure A-9 is from\nPratt&Whitney.

What criterion should be used to decide this?\nMaximum thermal efficiency? Maximum work? We examine this issue below.\nFigure A-10: Efficiency and work of two Brayton cycle engines\nThe problem is posed in Figure A-10, which shows two Brayton cycles. For maximum efficiency\nwe would like TR as high as possible. This means that the compressor exit temperature approaches\nthe turbine entry temperature. The net work will be less than the heat received; as T\nT\nb\nc\n→\nthe\nheat received approaches zero and so does the net work.\nThe net work in the cycle can also be expressed as Pdv\n∫\n, evaluated in traversing the cycle. This is\nthe area enclosed by the curves, which is seen to approach zero as T\nT\nb\nc\n→\n.\nV\nT = Tatm = Ta\nT = Tc\nCycle with Tb → Tc\nTb2\nTb1\nPatm\nP\nCycle with lower Tb\nRotor inlet gas\ntemperature vs Cooling\neffectiveness.\n\n1A-10\nThe conclusion from either of these arguments is that a cycle designed for maximum thermal\nefficiency is not very useful in that the work (power) we get out of it is zero.\nA more useful criterion is that of maximum work per unit mass (maximum power per unit mass\nflow). This leads to compact propulsion devices. The work per unit mass is given by:\nWork unit mass\nc\nT\nT\nT\nT\np\nc\nb\nd\na\n/\n\n=\n-\n(\n) -\n-\n(\n)\n[\n]\nMax. turbine temp. Atmospheric temperature\n\n(Design constraint)\nThe design variable is the compressor exit temperature, Tb, and to find the maximum as this is\nvaried, we differentiate the expression for work with respect to Tb:\ndWork\ndT\nc\ndT\ndT\ndT\ndT\ndT\ndT\nb\np\nc\nb\nd\nb\na\nb\n=\n--\n+\n\n.\nThe first and the fourth term on the right hand side of the above equation are both zero (the turbine\nentry temperature is fixed, as is the atmospheric temperature). The maximum work occurs where\nthe derivative of work with respect to Tb is zero:\ndWork\ndT\ndT\ndT\nb\nd\nb\n=\n= --\n.\n(A.4.1)\nTo use Eq. (A.4.1), we need to relate T and T\nd\nb. We know that\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT T\nT\nd\na\nc\nb\nd\na\nc\nb\n=\n=\nor\n.\nHence,\ndT\ndT\nT T\nT\nd\nb\na\nc\nb\n= -\n.\nPlugging this expression for the derivative into Eq. (A.4.1) gives the compressor exit temperature\nfor maximum work as T\nT T\nb\na\nc\n=\n. In terms of temperature ratio,\nCompressor temperature ratio for maximum work: T\nT\nT\nT\nb\na\nc\na\n=\n.\nThe condition for maximum work in a Brayton cycle is different than that for maximum efficiency.\nThe role of the temperature ratio can be seen if we examine the work per unit mass which is\ndelivered at this condition:\nWork unit mass\nc\nT\nT T\nT T\nT T\nT\np\nc\na\nc\na\nc\na\nc\na\n/\n\n=\n-\n-\n+\n\n.\nRatioing all temperatures to the engine inlet temperature,\nWork unit mass\nc T\nT\nT\nT\nT\np\na\nc\na\nc\na\n/\n\n=\n-\n+\n\n1 .\nTo find the power the engine can produce, we need to multiply the work per unit mass by the mass\nflow rate:\n\n1A-11\nPower\nmc T\nT\nT\nT\nT\np\na\nc\na\nc\na\n=\n-\n+\n\n-\n1 ; Maximum power for an ideal Brayton cycle (A.4.2)\n(The units are kg\ns\nJ\nkg- K K = J\ns = Watts.)\na) Gas turbine engine core\nb) Core power vs. turbine entry temperature\nFigure A-11: Aeroengine core power [Koff/Meese, 1995]\nFigure A-11 shows the expression for power of an ideal cycle compared with data from actual jet\nengines. Figure 11a shows the gas turbine engine layout including the core (compressor, burner,\nand turbine). Figure 11b shows the core power for a number of different engines as a function of\nthe turbine rotor entry temperature. The equation in the figure for horsepower (HP) is the same as\nthat we just derived, except for the conversion factors. The analysis not only shows the qualitative\ntrend very well but captures much of the quantitative behavior too.\nA final comment (for now) on Brayton cycles concerns the value of the thermal efficiency. The\nBrayton cycle thermal efficiency contains the ratio of the compressor exit temperature to\natmospheric temperature, so that the ratio is not based on the highest temperature in the cycle, as\nthe Carnot efficiency is. For a given maximum cycle temperature, the Brayton cycle is therefore\nless efficient than a Carnot cycle.\nMuddy points\nWhat are the units of w in\npower\nmw\n=\n-\n? (MP 1A.11)\nPrecision about the assumptions made in the Brayton cycle for maximum efficiency and\nmaximum work (MP 1A.12)\nYou said that for a gas turbine engine modeled as a Brayton cycle the work done is\nw=q 1\n+q 2 , where q 2 is the heat added and q 1 is the heat rejected. Does this suggest that the\nwork that you get out of the engine doesn't depend on how good your compressor and\nturbine are?...since the compression and expansion were modeled as adiabatic. (MP\n1A.13)\n1.A.5 Refrigerators and Heat Pumps\nThe Carnot cycle has been used for power, but we can also run it in reverse. If so, there is now net\nwork into the system and net heat out of the system. There will be a quantity of heatQ2 rejected at\nthe higher temperature and a quantity of heat Q1 absorbed at the lower temperature. The former of\nFigures A-11a. and A-11b. available from:\n\nB.L.

The result is that work is\ndone on the system, heat is extracted from a low temperature source and rejected to a high\ntemperature source. The words \"low\" and \"high\" are relative and the low temperature source\nmight be a crowded classroom on a hot day, with the heat extraction being used to cool the room.\nThe cycle and the heat and work transfers are indicated in Figure A-12. In this mode of operation\nP\nd\na\nb\nc\nV\nQ2\nQ1\nT1\nW\nT2\nSystem\nFigure A-12: Operation of a Carnot refrigerator\nthe cycle works as a refrigerator or heat pump. \"What we pay for\" is the work, and \"what we get\"\nis the amount of heat extracted. A metric for devices of this type is the coefficient of performance,\ndefined as\nCoefficient of performance = Q\nW\nQ\nQ\nQ\n=\n+\n.\nFor a Carnot cycle we know the ratios of heat in to heat out when the cycle is run forward and,\nsince the cycle is reversible, these ratios are the same when the cycle is run in reverse. The\ncoefficient of performance is thus given in terms of the absolute temperatures as\nCoefficient of performance =\n-\nT\nT\nT\n.\nThis can be much larger than unity.\nThe Carnot cycles that have been drawn are based on ideal gas behavior. For different working\nmedia, however, they will look different. We will see an example when we discuss two-phase\nsituations. What is the same whatever the medium is the efficiency for all Carnot cycles operating\nbetween the same two temperatures.\nMuddy points\nWould it be practical to run a Brayton cycle in reverse and use it as rerigerator? (MP\n1A.14)\n1.A.6 Reversibility and Irreversibility in Natural Processes\nWe wish to characterize the \"direction\" of natural processes; there is a basic\n\"directionality\" in nature. We start by examining a flywheel in a fluid filled insulated enclosure as\nshown in Figure A-13.\n\n1A-13\nState A: flywheel spinning,\nsystem cool\nState B: flywheel stationary\nFigure A-13: Flywheel in insulated enclosure at initial and final states\nA question to be asked is whether we could start with state B and then let events proceed to state\nA? Why or why not? The first law does not prohibit this.\nThe characteristics of state A are that the energy is in an organized form, the molecules in\nthe flywheel have some circular motion, and we could extract some work by using the flywheel\nkinetic energy to lift a weight. In state B, in contrast, the energy is associated with disorganized\nmotion on a molecular scale. The temperature of the fluid and flywheel are higher than in state A,\nso we could probably get some work out by using a Carnot cycle, but it would be much less than\nthe work we could extract in state A. There is a qualitative difference between these states, which\nwe need to be able to describe more precisely.\nMuddy points\nWhy is the ability to do work decreased in B? How do we know? (MP 1A.15)\nAnother example is a system composed of many bricks, half at a high temperature TH and half at a\nlow temperature TL (see IAW p. 42). With the bricks separated thermally, we have the ability to\nobtain work by running a cycle between the two temperatures. Suppose we put two bricks\ntogether. Using the first law we can write\nCT\nCT\nCT\nH\nL\nM\n+\n= 2\n.\nT\nT\nT\nH\nL\nM\n+\n(\n)\n=\n/2\nwhere C is the \"heat capacity\" = ∆\n∆\nQ\nT\n/\n. (For solids the heat capacities (specific heats) at\nconstant pressure and constant volume are essentially the same.) We have lost the ability to get\nwork out of these two bricks.\nCan we restore the system to the original state without contact with the outside? The answer is no.\nCan we restore the system to the original state with contact with the outside? The answer is yes.\nWe could run a refrigerator to take heat out of one brick and put it into the other, but we would\nhave to do work.\nWe can think of the overall process involving the system (the two bricks in an insulated setting)\nand the surroundings (the rest of the universe) as:\nSystem is changed\nSurroundings are unchanged.\nThe composite system (system and the surroundings) is changed by putting the bricks together.\nThe process is not reversible--there is no way to undo the change and leave no mark on the\nsurroundings.\n\n1A-14\nV1, T1\nVacuum\nWhat is the measure of change in the surroundings?\na) Energy? This is conserved.\nb) Ability to do work? This is decreased.\nThe measurement and characterization of this type of changes is the subject of the second law of\nthermodynamics.\n1.A.7 Difference between Free Expansion of a Gas and Reversible Isothermal Expansion\nThe difference between reversible and irreversible processes is brought out through\nexamination of the isothermal expansion of an ideal gas. The question to be asked is what is the\ndifference between the \"free expansion\" of a gas and the isothermal expansion against a piston?\nTo answer this, we address the steps that we would have to take to reverse, in other words, to undo\nthe process.\nBy free expansion, we mean the unrestrained\nexpansion of a gas into a volume as shown at the right.\nInitially all the gas is in the volume designated as V1 with the\nrest of the insulated enclosure a vacuum. The total volume\n(V1 plus the evacuated volume) is V2.\nAt a given time a hole is opened in the partition\nand the gas rushes through to fill the rest of the enclosure.\nDuring the expansion there is no work exchanged with the surroundings because there is no\nmotion of the boundaries. The enclosure is insulated so there is no heat exchange. The first law\ntells us therefore that the internal energy is constant ( ∆U = 0). For an ideal gas, the internal\nenergy is a function of temperature only so that the temperature of the gas before the free\nexpansion and after the expansion has been completed is the same. Characterizing the before and\nafter states;\nBefore: State 1,V\nV\nT\nT\n=\n,\n=\nAfter: State 2, V\nV\nT\nT\n=\n,\n=\n.\nQ=W=0, so there is no change in the surroundings.\nTo restore the original state, i.e., to go back to the original volume at the same temperature\nV\nV\nT\nT\n→\n(\n)\nat constant\n=\nwe can compress the gas isothermally (using work from an external\nagency). We can do this in a quasi-equilibrium manner, with P\nP\nsystem\nexternal\n≈\n. If so the work that\nwe need to do is W\nPdV\n= ∫\n. We have evaluated the work in a reversible isothermal expansion\n(Eq. A.1.1), and we can apply the arguments to the case of a reversible isothermal compression.\nThe work done on the system to go from state \"2\" to state \"1\" is\nW = Work done on system = NRT\nV\nV\nln\n\n.\nFrom the first law, this amount of heat must also be rejected from the gas to the surroundings if the\ntemperature of the gas is to remain constant. A schematic of the compression process, in terms of\nheat and work exchanged is shown in Figure A-14.\n\n1A-15\nWeight\nBlock\ng\nSystem\nW\nQ\nQ\nWork received, W\nP, T\nSystem\nW (work in)\nQ (heat out)\nFigure A-14: Work and heat exchange in the reversible isothermal compression process\nAt the end of the combined process (free expansion plus reversible compression):\na) The system has been returned to its initial state (no change in system state).\nb) The surroundings (us!) did work on the system of magnitude W.\nc) The surroundings received an amount of heat, Q, which is equal to W.\nd) The sum of all of these events is that we have converted an\namount of work, W, into an amount of heat, Q, with W and Q numerically equal in Joules.\nThe net effect is the same as if we let a weight fall\nand pull a block along a rough surface, as at right.\nThere is 100% conversion of work into heat.\nThe results of the free expansion can be contrasted against a process of isothermal expansion\nagainst a pressure dP which is slightly different than that of the system, as shown below.\nFigure A-15: Work and heat transfer in reversible isothermal expansion\n\n1A-16\nDuring the expansion, work is done on the surroundings of magnitudeW\nPdV\n= ∫\n, where P can be\ntaken as the system pressure. As evaluated in Eq. (A.1.1), the magnitude of the work done by the\nsystem is W=NRT\nV\nV\nln\n\n. At the end of the isothermal expansion, therefore:\na) The surroundings have received work W\nb) The surroundings have given up heat, Q, numerically equal to W.\nWe now wish to restore the system to its initial state, just as we did in the free expansion. To do\nthis we need to do work on the system and extract heat from the system, just as in the free\nexpansion. In fact, because we are doing a transition between the same states along the same path,\nthe work and heat exchange are the same as those for the compression process examined just\nabove.\nThe overall result when we have restored the system to the initial state, however, is quite different\nfor the reversible expansion and for the free expansion. For the reversible expansion, the work we\nneed to do on the system to compress it has the same magnitude as the work we received during\nthe expansion process. Indeed, we could raise a weight during the expansion and then allow it to\nbe lowered during the compression process. Similarly the heat put into the system by us (the\nsurroundings) during the expansion process has the same magnitude as the heat received by us\nduring the compression process. The result is that when the system has been restored back to its\ninitial state, so have the surroundings. There is no trace of the overall process on either the system\nor the surroundings. That is another meaning of the word \"reversible\".\nMuddy points\nWith the isothermal reversible expansion is\nPexternal constant? If so, how can we have\n\nP\nP\nsystem\nexternal\n≅\n? (MP 1A.16)\nWhy is the work done equal to zero in the free expansion? (MP 1A.17)\nIs irreversibility defined by whether or not a mark is left on the outside environment?\n(MP 1A.18)\n1.A.8 Features of reversible processes\nReversible processes are idealizations or models of real processes. One familiar, and widely used,\nexample is Bernoulli's equation, which you saw last year. They are extremely useful for defining\nlimits to system or device behavior, for enabling identification of areas in which inefficiencies\noccur, and in giving targets for design.\nAn important feature of a reversible process is that, depending on the process, it represents the\nmaximum work that can be extracted in going from one state to another, or the minimum work that\nis needed to create the state change. This is shown clearly in the discussion on page 46 of the\nWaitz notes. Said differently:\nThe work done by a system during a reversible process is the maximum work we can get.\nThe work done on a system in a reversible process is the minimum work we need to do to\nachieve that state change.\nA process must be quasi-static (quasi-equilibrium) to be reversible. This means that the\nfollowing effects must be absent or negligible.\n1) Friction\nIf P\nP\nexternal\nsystem\n=\n, as shown in (8) of Part 0, we would have to do work to bring the system\nfrom one volume to another and return it to the initial condition. [Review (8) of Part 0]\n\n1A-17\n2) Free (unrestrained) expansion\n3) Heat transfer through a finite temperature difference.\nQ2\nQ1\nQ1 = Q2\nT1\nT2\nSystem\nFigure A-16: Heat transfer across a finite temperature difference\nSuppose we have heat transfer from a high temperature to a lower temperature as shown\nabove. How do we restore the situation to the initial conditions? One thought would be to run a\nCarnot refrigerator to get an amount of heat, Q, from the lower temperature reservoir to the higher\ntemperature reservoir. We could do this but the surroundings, again us, would need to provide\nsome amount of work (which we could find using our analysis of the Carnot refrigerator). The net\n(and only) result at the end of the combined process would be a conversion of an amount of work\ninto heat. For reversible heat transfer from a heat reservoir to a system, the temperatures of the\nsystem and the reservoir must be T\nT\ndT\nheat reservoir\nsystem\n\n=\n±\n. In other words the difference between\nthe temperatures of the two entities involved in the heat transfer process can only differ by an\ninfinitesimal amount, dT.\nAll natural processes are irreversible to some extent, and reversible processes are idealized models.\nIn natural processes, the conditions for mechanical, thermal, and chemical equilibrium may not be\nsatisfied. In addition, dissipative effects (viscosity, friction) exist. Reversible processes are quasi-\nequilibrium, with no dissipative effects. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that there are a\nnumber of engineering situations where the effect of irreversibility can be neglected and the\nreversible process furnishes an excellent approximation to reality.\nThe second law, which is the next topic we address, allows us to make a quantitative statement\nconcerning the irreversibility of a given physical process.\nFigure A-17: this is Nicolas Sadi Carnot (1796-1832), an engineer and an officer in the French army.\nCarnot's work is all the more remarkable because it was made without benefit of the first law, which\nwas not discovered until 30 years later. [Atkins, The Second Law].\nPortrait of Nicolas Sadi Carnot,\npainted by Louis Leopold Boilly,\n1813.\n\n1A-18\nMuddy points\nIs heat transfer across a finite temperature difference only irreversible if no device is\npresent between the two to harvest the potential difference ? (MP 1A.19)\n\nMuddiest Points on Part 1A\n1A.1 Since h = 1 - T1/T2, looking at the P-V graph, does that mean the farther apart the\nT1, T2 isotherms are, the greater the efficiency? And that if they were very close, it\nwould be very inefficient?\nThis is correct. However, there is a limit on the maximum achievable efficiency. We\ncannot convert the absorbed heat into 100% work, that is, we always must reject some\namount of heat. The amount of heat we must reject is\nQR = - T1/T2*QA\n(see notes for derivation).\nThus for given values of T2 and QA, QR depends only on the temperature of the cold\nreservoir T1, which is limited by the temperatures naturally available to us. These\ntemperatures are all well above absolute zero, and there are no means to reduce QR to\nnegligible values. The consequence of this is that the Carnot cycle efficiency cannot\napproach one (η = 1 only if QR = 0, which is not possible).\n1A.2 In the Carnot cycle, why are we only dealing with volume changes and not pressure\nchanges on the adiabats and isotherms?\nWe are not neglecting the pressure terms and we are also dealing with pressure changes.\nOn the adiabats we know that dq = 0 (adiabatic process), so that for reversible processes\nwe can write the first law as du = -Pdv and, using enthalpy, also as dh = vdP. With dh =\ncp dT and du = cv dT for an ideal gas, we can write the ratio of dh/du as\ndh/du = cp/cv = γ = -(v dP) / ( Pdv).\nBy arranging terms we obtain\ndP/P = -γ dv/v.\nFor a process we can integrate from 1 to 2 and get P2v2\nγ = P1v1\nγ, or Pvγ = const. This\nrelation shows how pressure and volume changes are related to one another during an\nadiabatic reversible process.\nDuring an isothermal process, the temperature stays constant. Using the equation of state\nfor an ideal gas Pv = RT, we find that Pv = const on an isotherm. Again, this relation tells\nus how pressure changes are related to volume changes during an isothermal process.\nNote that in the P-V diagram, adiabats (Pvγ = constant) are steeper curves than isotherms\n(Pv = constant).\n\n1A.3 Is there a physical application for the Carnot cycle? Can we design a Carnot engine\nfor a propulsion device?\nWe will see that Carnot cycles are the best we can do in terms of efficiency. A constant\ntemperature heat transfer process is, however, difficult to attain in practice for devices in\nwhich high rates of power are required. The main role of the Carnot engine is therefore as\na standard against which all other cycles are compared and which shows us the direction\nin which design of efficient cycles should go.\n1A.4 How do we know which cycles to use as models for real processes?\nWe have discussed this briefly for the Brayton cycle, in that we looked at the\napproximation that was made in saying heat addition occurred at constant pressure. You\ncan also see that the Carnot cycle is not a good descriptor of a gas turbine engine! We\nwill look further at this general point, not only for the Brayton cycle, but also for the\nRankine cycle and for some internal combustion engine cycles. I will try to make clear\nwhat are the approximations and why the cycle under study is being used as a model.\n1A.5 When flow is accelerated in a nozzle, doesn't that reduce the internal energy of the\nflow and therefore the enthalpy?\nIndeed both enthalpy and internal energy are reduced. The stagnation enthalpy is the\nquantity that is constant.\n1A.6 Why do we say that the combustion in a gas turbine engine is at constant\npressure?\nThis is an approximation, and a key question is indeed how accurate it is and what the\njustification is. The pressure change in the combustor can be analyzed using the 1-\ndimensional compressible flow equations. The momentum equation is\ndP\ncdc\n= -ρ\n, where c is the velocity.\nIf we divide both sides by P, we obtain:\ndP\nP\nc\nP/\ndc\nc\nc\na\ndc\nc\nM dc\nc\n= -\n= -\n= -\nγ\nγ\nρ\nγ\nγ\n,\nwhere a is the speed of sound and M is the Mach number.\nChanges in velocity are due to changes in density and in flow-through area, as given by\nthe 1-dimensional continuity equation\nHence\nDifferentiating,\nρca = constant\nln\nln\nln\nρ +\n+\n=\nc\na\nconstant\nd\ndc\nc\ndA\nA\n0, or dc\nc\ndA\nA\nd\nρ\nρ\nρ\nρ\n+\n+\n=\n= -\n-\n\nVelocity changes are therefore related to area changes (geometry) and density changes\n(basically heat input). For a gas turbine combustion process the change in density is\ncomparable with (a significant fraction of) the initial density and the area change is\nseveral times the initial area. This means that the change in velocity divided by the initial\nvelocity is roughly of the order of magnitude of unity. The momentum equation thus tells\nus that for small Mach number (say 0.1) the ratio dP/P will be much less than one, so that\nthe pressure can be approximated as constant. In reality the pressure does drop in the\ncombustor, but the overall drop from inlet to exit is about 3-4%, small compared to the\ninitial level of pressure, so that the approximation of constant pressure is a useful one.\nThe rapidity of the combustion process does not really have anything to do with this\napproximation. We could have a process, such as a nozzle, in which there was\ncombustion at the same time that the pressure was dropping. As seen from the\nmomentum equation, the heat addition does not \"directly\" affect the pressure - changes in\npressure are associated with changes in velocity.\n1A.7 Why is the Brayton cycle less efficient than the Carnot cycle?\nConsider the Brayton cycle and the corresponding work done as being approximated by a\nnumber of elementary Carnot cycles, as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 1. All of\nthese Carnot cycles have the same pressure ratio, thus the same temperature ratio, and\nthus the same efficiency. The temperature ratio that figures into the efficiency of the\nelementary Carnot cycles is the inlet temperature divided by the compressor exit\ntemperature, not the maximum cycle temperature, which is at the combustor exit. The\nbasic reason for the lower efficiency is that heat is absorbed at an average temperature\nthat is lower than the maximum temperature and rejected at an average temperature\nhigher than the minimum temperature. We will come back to this important point (which\nhas implications for all cycles), but if you cannot wait, see Section 1-C of the notes.\nFigure 1 - Brayton cycle considered as a number of elementary Carnot cycles, all having\nthe same pressure ratio and therefore the same temperature ratio, which is lower than the\noverall cycle temperature ratio,\nP\nv\nBrayton cycle (solid line)\nElementary Carnot Cycle\n(dashed lines)\nTmax /\n.\nmin\nT\n\n1A.8 If the gas undergoes constant pressure cooling in the exhaust outside the engine,\nis that still within the system boundary?\nWhen we analyze the state changes as we trace them around the cycle, we are viewing\nthe changes in a system, a mass of fixed identity. Thus we follow the mass as it moves\nthrough the device and the cooling of the gas outside the engine is happening to our\nsystem.\n1A.9 Does it matter what labels we put on the corners of the cycle or not?\nIt does not matter what labels we use on the corners of the cycle. A cycle is a series of\nprocesses. Independent of where you start in the cycle, it always brings you back to the\nstate where you started.\n1A.10 Is the work done in the compressor always equal to the work done in the turbine\nplus work out (for a Brayton cyle)?\nNO. The work done in the compressor plus net work out equals the total turbine work.\nUsing the 1st law, the net work we get out of the Brayton cycle is\nw = q2 + q1 = cp [(Ta - Td) + (Tc - Tb)]\n(see notes for details). Rearranging the temperatures we can also write\nw = cp [(Tc - Td) - (Tb - Ta)] = Dhturbine - Dhcompressor.\nThus the net work is the difference between the enthalpy drop across the turbine (we get\nwork from the turbine) and the enthalpy rise through the compressor (we have to supply\nwork to the compressor).\n1A.11 What are the units of w in power\nmw\n=\n-\n?\nThe units of power are J/s (kJ/s, MJ/s) or Watts (kW, MW). The mass flow is kg/s. The\nunits of w, work per unit mass, are thus J/kg. For the aeroengine, we can think of a given\ndiameter (frontal area) as implying a given mass flow (think of a given Mach number and\nhence a given ratio of flow to choked flow). If so, for a given fan diameter power scales\ndirectly as work per unit mass.\n1A.12 Precision about the assumptions made in the Brayton cycle for maximum\nefficiency and maximum work\nWe have first derived a general expression for the thermal efficiency of an ideal Brayton\ncycle (see Equation A.3.3 in your notes). The assumptions we made for the cycle were\nthat both the compressor and turbine are ideal, such that they can be modeled adiabatic\nand reversible. We then looked at possible ideal Brayton cycles that would yield (A)\nmaximum efficiency and (B) maximum work, keeping the assumptions of an ideal cycle\n\n(the assumptions of adiabatic and reversible compression and expansion stem from the\nchoice of an ideal cycle). One way to construct an ideal Brayton cycle in the P-V\ndiagram is to choose the inlet temperature Ta and inlet pressure Pa, the compressor\npressure ratio Pb/Pa or temperature ratio Tb/Ta, and the turbine inlet temperature Tc. Apart\nfrom setting the inlet conditions (these mainly depend on the flight altitude and Mach\nnumber and the day), we decided to fix the turbine inlet temperature (fixed by material\ntechnology or cost). So the only two \"floating\" cycle parameters that remain to be defined\nare the compressor exit temperature Tb and the turbine exit temperature Td. Looking at\nequation A.3.3 we know that the higher the compressor temperature ratio Tb/Ta the higher\nthe thermal efficiency. So, for (A) maximum efficiency we would chose the compressor\nexit temperature as high as possible, that is in the limit Tb = Tc. Constructing this cycle in\nthe P-V diagram and letting Tb approach Tc shows that the area enclosed by the cycle, or\nin other words the net work, becomes zero. Thus a cycle constructed under the given inlet\nconditions and constraints on Tc is not very useful because we don't get any work out of\nit.\nFor the derivation of Tb for maximum work (keeping Tc fixed as above), see notes for\ndetails.\n1A.13 You said that for a gas turbine engine modeled as a Brayton cycle the work done\nis w=q1+q2, where q2 is the heat added and q1 is the heat rejected. Does this\nsuggest that the work that you get out of the engine doesn't depend on how good\nyour compressor and turbine are?...since the compression and expansion were\nmodeled as adiabatic.\nUsing the 1st law, the net work we get out of the cycle is\nw = q2 + q1 = cp [(Ta - Td) + (Tc - Tb)]\n(see notes for details). Rearranging the temperatures we can also write\nw = cp [(Tc - Td) - (Tb - Ta)] = ∆hturbine - ∆hcompressor.\nThus the net work is the difference between the enthalpy drop across the turbine (we get\nwork from the turbine) and the enthalpy rise through the compressor (we have to supply\nwork to the compressor, this is done through the drive shaft that connects turbine and\ncompressor).\nIn class we analyzed an ideal Brayton cycle with the assumptions of adiabatic reversible\ncompression and expansion processes, meaning that the work done by the turbine is the\nmaximum work we can get from the given turbine (operating between Tc and Td), and\nthe work needed to drive the given compressor is the minimum work required. In the\nassumptions the emphasis is put on reversible rather than adiabatic. For real engines the\nassumption of adiabatic flow through the compressor and turbine still holds. This is an\napproximation - the surface inside the compressor or turbine where heat can be\ntransferred is much smaller than the mass flow of the fluid moving through the machine\n\nso that the heat transfer is negligible - we will discuss the different concepts of heat\ntransfer later in class. However the compression and expansion processes in real engines\nare irreversible due to non-ideal behavior and loss mechanisms occurring in the\nturbomachinery flow. Thus the thermal efficiency and work for a real jet engine with\nlosses depend on the component efficiencies of turbine and compressor and are less than\nfor an ideal jet engine. We will discuss these component efficiencies in more detail in\nclass.\n1A.14 Would it be practical to run a Brayton cycle in reverse and use it as rerigerator?\nYes. In fact people in Cryogenics use reversed Brayton cycles to cool down systems\nwhere very low temperatures are required (e.g. space applications, liquefaction of\npropellants). One major difference between a regular Brayton cycle (such as a jet-engine\nor a gas-turbine) and a reversed Brayton cycle is the working fluid. In order to make a\nreversed Brayton cycle practical we have to choose a working fluid that is appropriate for\nthe application.\nExtremely low temperatures can be achieved when using a regenerator - a heat\nexchanger that preheats the fluid before it enters the compressor and cools the fluid\nfurther down before it enters the turbine. In this configuration the fluid is expanded to\nmuch lower temperatures, and more heat can be absorbed from the cooling compartment.\n1A.15 Why is the ability to do work decreased in B? How do we know?\nIn state A, the energy is in organized form and the molecules move along circular paths\naround the spinning flywheel. We could get work out this system by using all of the\nkinetic energy of the flywheel and for example lift a weight with it. The energy of the\nsystem in state B (flywheel not spinning) is associated with disorganized motion (on the\nmolecular scale). The temperature in state B is higher than in state A. We could also\nextract work from state B by running for example an ideal Carnot cycle between TB and\nsome heat reservoir at lower temperature. However the work we would get from this\nideal Carnot cycle is less than the work we get from state A (all of the kinetic energy),\nbecause we must reject some heat when we convert heat into work (we cannot convert\nheat into 100% work). Although the energy of the system in state A is the same as in state\nB (we know this from 1st law) the \"organization\" of the energy is different, and thus the\nability to do work is different.\n1A.16 With the isothermal reversible expansion, is Pexternal constant? If so, how can we\nhave Psystem≅Pexternal?\nFor a reversible process, if the external pressure were constant, there would need to be a\nforce that pushed on the piston so the process could be considered quasi-equilibrium.\nThis force could be us, it could be a system of weights, or it could be any other work\nreceiver. Under these conditions the system pressure would not necessarily be near the\nexternal pressure but we would have P\nP\nF\nA\nsystem\nexternal\nwork receiver\npiston\n≅\n+\n\n. We can of course\n\nthink of a situation in which the external pressure was varied so it was always close to the\nsystem pressure, but that is not necessary.\n1A.17 Why is the work done equal to zero in the free expansion?\nIn this problem, the system is everything inside the rigid container. There is no change in\nvolume, no \"dV\", so no work done on the surroundings. Pieces of the gas might be\nexpanding, pushing on other parts of the gas, and doing work locally inside the container\n(and other pieces might be compressed and thus receive work) during the free expansion\nprocess, but we are considering the system as a whole, and there is no net work done.\n1A.18 Is irreversibility defined by whether or not a mark is left on the outside\nenvironment?\nA process is irreversible when there is no way to undo the change without leaving a mark\non the surroundings or \"the rest of the universe\". In the example with the bricks, we could\nundo the change by putting a Carnot refrigerator between the bricks (both at TM after\nputting them together) and cooling one brick down to TL and heating the other brick to TH\nto restore the initial state. To do this we have to supply work to the refrigerator and we\nwill also reject some heat to the surroundings. Thus we leave a mark on the environment\nand the process is irreversible.\n1A.19 Is heat transfer across a finite temperature difference only irreversible if no device\nis present between the two to harvest the potential difference?\nIf we have two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, the irreversibility associated with\nthe transfer of heat from one to the other is indeed dependent on what is between them.\nIf there is a copper bar between them, all the heat that comes out of the high temperature\nreservoir goes into the low temperature reservoir, with the result given in Section 1.B.5.\nIf there were a Carnot cycle between them, some (not all ) heat from the high temperature\nreservoir would be passed on to the low temperature reservoir, the process would be\nreversible, and work would be done. The extent to which the process is irreversible for\nany device can be assessed by computing the total entropy change (device plus\nsurroundings) associated with the heat transfer."

      "content": "1.B: The Second Law of Thermodynamics\n[IAW 42-50; VN Chapter 5; VWB&S-6.3, 6.4, Chapter 7]\n1.B.1 Concept and Statements of the Second Law (Why do we need a second law?)\nThe unrestrained expansion, or the temperature equilibration of the two bricks, are familiar\nprocesses. Suppose you are asked whether you have ever seen the reverse of these processes take\nplace? Do two bricks at a medium temperature ever go to a state where one is hot and one is cold?\nWill the gas in the unrestrained expansion ever spontaneously return to occupying only the left side\nof the volume? Experience hints that the answer is no. However, both these processes, unfamiliar\nthough they may be, are compatible with the first law. In other words the first law does not prohibit\ntheir occurrence. There thus must be some other \"great principle\" that describes the direction of\nnatural processes, that tells us which first law compatible processes will not be observed. This is\ncontained in the second law. Like the first law, it is a generalization from an enormous amount of\nobservation.\nThere are several ways in which the second law of thermodynamics can be stated. Listed\nbelow are three that are often encountered. As described in class (and as derived in almost every\nthermodynamics textbook), although the three may not appear to have much connection with each\nother, they are equivalent.\n1) No process is possible whose sole result is the absorption of heat from a reservoir and the\nconversion of this heat into work. [Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law]\nQ\nSystem\nT2\nW\nThis is not possible\nT1\n2) No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a cooler to a hotter body.\n[Clausius statement of the second law]\nQ\nT2\nT1\nFor T1 < T2 , this is not possible\nQ\n1B-1\n\n3) There exists a property called entropy, S, which is a thermodynamic property of a system. For a\nreversible process, changes in this property are given by\ndS = (dQreversible)/T\nThe entropy change of any system and its surroundings, considered together, is positive and\napproaches zero for any process which approaches reversibility.\n∆Stotal > 0\nFor an isolated system, i.e., a system that has no interaction with the surroundings, changes in the\nsystem have no effect on the surroundings. In this case, we need to consider the system only, and\nthe first and second laws become:\n∆E system = 0\n∆S system > 0\nFor an isolated system the total energy (E = U + Kinetic Energy + Potential Energy + ....) is constant.\nThe entropy can only increase or, in the limit of a reversible process, remain constant.\nAll of these statements are equivalent, but (3) gives a direct, quantitative measure of the departure\nfrom reversibility.\nEntropy is not a familiar concept and it may be helpful to provide some additional rationale for its\nappearance. If we look at the first law,\ndU = dQ - dW\nthe term on the left is a function of state, while the two terms on the right are not. For a simple\ncompressible substance, however, we can write the work done in a reversible process as dW = PdV ,\nso that\ndU = dQ - PdV ; First law for a simple compressible substance, reversible process.\nTwo out of the three terms in this equation are expressed in terms of state variables. It seems\nplausible that we ought to be able to express the third term using state variables as well, but what are\nthe appropriate variables? If so, the term dQ = ( ) [ ] should perhaps be viewed as analogous to dW =\nPdV where the parenthesis denotes an intensive state variable and the square bracket denotes an\nextensive state variable. The second law tells us that the intensive variable is the temperature, T, and\nthe extensive state variable is the entropy, S.\nThe first law for a simple compressible substance in terms of state variables is thus\ndU = TdS - PdV .\n(B.1.1)\nBecause Eq. (B.1.1) includes the second law, it is referred to as the combined first and second law.\nBecause it is written in terms of state variables, it is true for all processes, not just reversible ones.\nWe list below some attributes of entropy:\na) S is an extensive variable. The entropy per unit mass, or specific entropy, is s.\n1B-2\n\nb) The units of entropy are Joules per degree Kelvin (J/K).

(MP 1B.1)\nWhat makes dQrev different than dQ? (MP 1B.2)\n1.B.2 Axiomatic Statements of the Laws of Thermodynamics1\n(i.) Introduction\nAs a further aid in familiarization with the second law of thermodynamics and the idea of\nentropy, we draw an analogy with statements made previously concerning quantities that are closer\nto experience. In particular, we wish to (re-) present the Zeroth and First Laws of thermodynamics\nin the same framework as we have used for the Second Law. In this so-called \"axiomatic\nformulation\", the Zeroth, First and Second Laws are all introduced in a similar fashion.\n(ii.) Zeroth Law\nWe start with a statement which is based on two observations:\na)\nIf two bodies are in contact through a thermally-conducting boundary for a sufficiently long\ntime, no further observable changes take place; thermal equilibrium is said to prevail.\nb) Two systems which are individually in thermal equilibrium with a third are in thermal\nequilibrium with each other; all three systems have the same value of the property called\ntemperature.\nThe closely connected ideas of temperature and thermal equilibrium are formally expressed in the\n\"Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics\":\nZeroth Law\nThere exists for every thermodynamic system in equilibrium a property\ncalled temperature. Equality of temperature is a necessary and\nsufficient condition for thermal equilibrium.\nThe Zeroth law thus defines a property (temperature) and describes its behavior.\n(iii.) First Law\nObservations also show that for any system there is a property called the energy. The First\nLaw asserts that one must associate such a property with every system.\nFirst Law\nThere exists for every thermodynamic system a property called the\nenergy. The change of energy of a system is equal to the mechanical\nwork done on the system in an adiabatic process. In a non-adiabatic\nprocess, the change in energy is equal to the heat added to the system\nminus the mechanical work done by the system.\n1 From notes of Professor F. E. C. Culick, California Institute of Technology (with minor changes)\n1B-3\n\nOn the basis of experimental results, therefore, one is led to assert the existence of two new\nproperties, the temperature and internal energy, which do not arise in ordinary mechanics. In a\nsimilar way, a further remarkable relationship between heat and temperature will be established, and\na new property, the entropy, defined. Although this is a much less familiar property, it is to be\nstressed that the general approach is quite like that used to establish the Zeroth and First Laws. A\ngeneral principle and a property associated with any system are extracted from experimental results.\nViewed in this way, the entropy should appear no more mystical than the internal energy. The\nincrease of entropy in a naturally occurring process is no less real than the conservation of energy.\n(iv.) Second Law\nAlthough all natural processes must take place in accordance with the First Law, the\nprinciple of conservation of energy is, by itself, inadequate for an unambiguous description of the\nbehavior of a system. Specifically, there is no mention of the familiar observation that every natural\nprocess has in some sense a preferred direction of action. For example, the flow of heat occurs\nnaturally from hotter to colder bodies, in the absence of other influences, but the reverse flow\ncertainly is not in violation of the First Law. So far as that law is concerned, the initial and final\nstates are symmetrical in a very important respect.\nThe Second Law is essentially different from the First Law; the two principles are\nindependent and cannot in any sense be deduced from one another. Thus, the concept of energy is\nnot sufficient, and a new property must appear. This property can be developed, and the Second\nLaw introduced, in much the same way as the Zeroth and First Laws were presented. By\nexamination of certain observational results, one attempts to extract from experience a law which is\nsupposed to be general; it is elevated to the position of a fundamental axiom to be proved or\ndisproved by subsequent experiments. Within the structure of classical thermodynamics, there is no\nproof more fundamental than observations. A statement which can be adopted as the Second Law of\nthermodynamics is:\nSecond Law\nThere exists for every thermodynamic system in equilibrium an\nextensive scalar property called the entropy, S, such that in an\ninfinitesimal reversible change of state of the system, dS = dQ/T,\nwhere T is the absolute temperature and dQ is the amount of heat\nreceived by the system. The entropy of a thermally insulated system\ncannot decrease and is constant if and only if all processes are\nreversible.\nAs with the Zeroth and First Laws, the existence of a new property is asserted and its behavior is\ndescribed.\n(v.) Reversible Processes\nIn the course of this development, the idea of a completely reversible process is central, and\nwe can recall the definition, \"a process is called completely reversible if, after the process has\noccurred, both the system and its surroundings can be wholly restored by any means to their\nrespective initial states\". Especially, it is to be noted that the definition does not, in this form,\nspecify that the reverse path must be identical with the forward path. If the initial states can\nbe restored by any means whatever, the process is by definition completely reversible. If the paths\nare identical, then one usually calls the process (of the system) reversible, or one may say that the\nstate of the system follows a reversible path. In this path (between two equilibrium states 1 and 2),\n(i) the system passes through the path followed by the equilibrium states only, and (ii) the system\nwill take the reversed path 2 to 1 by a simple reversal of the work done and heat added.\nReversible processes are idealizations not actually encountered. However, they are clearly\n1B-4\n\nh\nu\n\nρ\nuseful idealizations. For a process to be completely reversible, it is necessary that it be quasi-static\nand that there be no dissipative influences such as friction and diffusion. The precise (necessary and\nsufficient) condition to be satisfied if a process is to be reversible is the second part of the Second\nLaw.\nThe criterion as to whether a process is completely reversible must be based on the initial and\nfinal states. In the form presented above, the Second Law furnishes a relation between the properties\ndefining the two states, and thereby shows whether a natural process connecting the states is\npossible.\nMuddy points\nWhat happens when all the energy in the universe is uniformly spread, ie, entropy at a\nmaximum?

For the specific situation in which∆s = 0, i.e., the\nentropy is constant, we recover the expression Pvγ = constant. It was stated that this expression\napplied to a reversible, adiabatic process. We now see, through use of the second law, a deeper\nmeaning to the expression, and to the concept of a reversible adiabatic process, in that both are\ncharacteristics of a constant entropy, or isentropic, process.\nMuddy points\nWhy do you rewrite the entropy change in terms of Pvγ? (MP 1B.4)\nWhat is the difference between isentropic and adiabatic? (MP 1B.5)\n1.B.5 Calculation of Entropy Change in Some Basic Processes\na) Heat transfer from, or to, a heat reservoir.\nA heat reservoir is a constant temperature heat source\nor sink. Because the temperature is uniform, there is no\nheat transfer across a finite temperature difference and\nthe heat exchange is reversible. From the definition of\nentropy (dS = dQrev /T ) ,\n∆S = Q ,\nT\nwhere Q is the heat into the reservoir (defined here\nas positive if heat flows into the reservoir)\nb) Heat transfer between two heat reservoirs\nThe entropy changes of the two reservoirs are\nthe sum of the entropy change of each. If the high\nand the low\ntemperature reservoir is at TH\ntemperature reservoir is at TL , the total entropy\nchange is\nTH\nQH\nQH\nHeat transfer from/to a heat reservoir\nQ\nTH\nTL\nDevice (block of copper)\nno work\nno change in state\nHeat transfer between two reservoirs\n1B-7\n\nH\n∆S =\n\n-Q\n+\n\nQ\n= Q (TH - TL )\nTH\nTL\nT TL\nThe second law says that the entropy change must be equal to or greater than zero. This\ncorresponds to the statement that heat must flow from the higher temperature source to the lower\ntemperature source. This is one of the statements of the second law given in Section 1.B.1.\nMuddy points\nIn the single reservoir example, why can the entropy decrease? (MP 1B.6)9\nWhy does the entropy of a heat reservoir change if the temperature stays the same? (MP9\n1B.7)9\nHow can the heat transfer from or to a heat reservoir be reversible? (MP 1B.8)9\nHow can ∆S be less than zero in any process? Doesn't entropy always increase? (MP 1B.9)9\nIf Q = ∆S for a reservoir, could you add Q to any size reservoir and still get the same ∆S?\nT\n(MP 1B.10)\nc) Possibility of obtaining work from a single heat reservoir\nWe can regard the proposed process as the\nabsorption of heat, Q, by a device or system,\noperating in a cycle, rejecting no heat, and\nproducing work. The total entropy change is the\nsum of the change in the reservoir, the system or\ndevice, and the surroundings. The entropy change\nof the reservoir is ∆S = -Q/TH . The entropy\nchange of the device is zero, because we are\nconsidering a complete cycle (return to initial state)\nand entropy is a function of state. The\nsurroundings receive work only so the entropy\nchange of the surroundings is zero.\nThe total entropy change is\nWork from a single heat reservoir\n∆Stotal = ∆Sreservoir + ∆Sdevice + ∆Ssurroundings\n/\n+\n= -Q TH + 0\n\nThe total entropy change in the proposed process is thus less than zero,\n∆Stotal < 0\nwhich is not possible. The second law thus tells us that we cannot get work from a single reservoir\nonly. The \"only\" is important; it means without any other changes occurring. This is the other\nstatement of the second law we saw in Section 1.B.1.\nMuddy points\nWhat is the difference between the isothermal expansion of a piston and the (forbidden)\nproduction of work using a single reservoir? (MP 1B.11)\nFor the \"work from a single heat reservoir\" example, how do we know there is no ∆Ssurr?\n(MP 1B.12)\n1B-8\n\nHow does a cycle produce zero ∆S? I thought that the whole thing about cycles was an\nentropy that the designers try to minimize. (MP 1B.13)\nd) Entropy changes in the \"hot brick problem\"\nWe can examine in a more quantitative manner the changes that occurred when we put the two\nbricks together, as depicted on the left-hand side of the figure below. The process by which the\ntwo bricks come to the same temperature is not a reversible one, so we need to devise a reversible\npath. To do this imagine a large number of heat reservoirs at varying temperatures spanning the\nrange TH - dT,............,TL + dT , as in the right hand side of the figures. The bricks are put in\ncontact with them sequentially to raise the temperature of one and lower the temperature of the\nTH\nTL\nTM\nTM\nTH\n........\nTL\nTH - dT\nTL + dT\nTemperature equalization of two bricks\nReservoirs used in reversible state transformation\nother in a reversible manner. The heat exchange at any of these steps is dQ = CdT . For the high\ntemperature brick, the entropy change is:\nTM CdT = C ln\n\nTM\n\n∆Shot brick = ∫TH\nT\nTH\nwhere C is the heat capacity of the brick (J/kg). This quantity is less than zero. For the cold brick,\nTM CdT = C ln\n\nTM\n.\n∆Scold brick = ∫TL\nT\nTL\nThe entropy change of the two bricks is\n∆Sbricks = C\nln\n\nTM\n+ ln\n\nTM\n\n= C ln TM > 0.\n\nTH\nTL\nT T\nH\nL\n\nThe process is not reversible.\ne) Difference between the free expansion and the reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas\nThe essential difference between the free expansion in an insulated enclosure and the\nreversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas can also be captured clearly in terms of entropy\nchanges. For a state change from initial volume and temperature V T1 to final volume and (the\n1,\nsame) temperature V T1 the entropy change is\n2 ,\n2 dU\n2 PdV\n∆S = ∫1 dS = ∫1 T + ∫1\n,\nT\n1B-9\n\nT S\nT S\nV\nV\n-\nor, making use of the equation of state and the fact that dU = 0 for an isothermal process,\n∆S = NR ln\n2 .\nV1\nThis is the entropy change that occurs for the free expansion as well as for the isothermal\nreversible expansion processes--entropy changes are state changes and the two system final and\nend states are the same for both processes.\nFor the free expansion:\n∆Ssystem = NR ln\n\nV2\n; ∆Ssurroundings = 0\nV1\nThere is no change in the entropy of the surroundings because there is no interaction between the\nsystem and the surroundings. The total entropy change is therefore,\n∆Stotal = ∆Ssystem + ∆Ssurroundings = NR ln\n\nV2\n> 0.\nV1\nThere are several points to note from this result.\ni) ∆Stotal > 0 so the process is not reversible\n2 dQ\nii) ∆Ssystem > ∫1 T = 0; the equality between ∆S and dQ is only for a reversible\nT\nprocess\niii) There is a direct connection between the work needed to restore the system to\nthe original state and the entropy change:\nW = NRT ln\n2 = ∆ 2 1\nV1\nThe quantity ∆ has a physical meaning as \"lost work\" in the sense of work\nwhich we lost the opportunity to utilize. We will make this connection stronger in\nSection 1.C.\nFor the reversible isothermal expansion:\nThe entropy is a state variable so the entropy change of the system is the same as before. In this\ncase, however, heat is transferred to the system from the surroundings ( Qsurroundings < 0) so that\n∆Ssurroundings = Qsurroundings\n< 0.\nT\nThe heat transferred from the surroundings, however, is equal to the heat received by the system:\nQsurroundings = Qsystem = W .\n∆Ssurroundings = Qsurroundings\n= -W = - NR ln\n\nV2\n.\nT\nT\nV1\nThe total change in entropy (system plus surroundings) is therefore\n∆Stotal = ∆Ssystem + ∆Ssurroundings = Q - Q = 0.\nT\nT\nThe reversible process has zero total change in entropy.\n1B-109\n\nMuddy points\nOn the example of free expansion versus isothermal expansion, how do we know that the9\npressure and volume ratios are the same? We know for each that P9\n1B.14)9\n2>P1 and V2>V1. (MP\nWhere did ∆Ssystem = NRln\n\nV2\ncome from? (MP 1B.15)\nV1\n1B-119\n\nMuddiest Points on Part 1B\n1B.1 Why is dU = TdS - PdV always true?\nThis is a relation between state variables. As such it is not path dependent, only depends\non the initial and final states, and thus must hold no matter how we transition from initial\nstate to final state. What is not always true, and what holds only for reversible processes\nare the relations Tds = dq and Pdv = dw. One example of this is the free expansion where\ndq = dw = 0, but where the quantities Tds and Pdv (and the integrals of these quantities)\nare not zero.\n1B.2 What makes dQrev different than dQ?\nThe term dQrev denotes the heat exchange during a reversible process. We use the\nnotation dQ to denote heat exchange during any process, not necessarily reversible. The\ndistinction between the two is important for the reason given above in (3).\n1B.3 What happens when all the energy in the universe is uniformly spread, ie, entropy at\na maximum?\nI quote from The Refrigerator and the Universe, by Goldstein and Goldstein:\n\"The entropy of the universe is not yet at its maximum possible value and it seems to be\nincreasing all the time. Looking forward to the future, Kelvin and Clausius foresaw a\ntime when the maximum possible entropy would be reached and the universe would be at\nequilibrium forever afterward; at this point, a state called the \"heat death\" of the universe,\nnothing would happen forever after\". The book also gives comments on the inevitability\nof this fate.\n1B.4 Why do you rewrite the entropy change in terms of Pvγ?\nWe have discussed the representation of thermodynamic changes in P-v coordinates a\nnumber of times and it is familiar, as is the idea of the \" Pvγ = constant \" process. I want\nto relate this to the more general expression involving the entropy change (Equation\nB.4.4) to show (i) when the simple form applied and (ii) how valid an approximation it\nwas. Using the entropy change, we now have a quantitative metric for doing just that.\n1B.5 What is the difference between isentropic and adiabatic?\nIsentropic means no change in entropy (dS = 0). An adiabatic process is a process with no\nheat transfer (dQ = 0). We defined for reversible processes TdS = dQ. So generally an\nadiabatic process is not necessarily isentropic - only if the process is reversible and\nadiabatic we can call it isentropic. For example a real compressor can be assumed\nadiabatic but is operating with losses. Due to the losses the compression is irreversible.\nThus the compression is not isentropic.\n\n1B.6 In the single reservoir example, why can the entropy decrease?\nWhen we looked at the single reservoir, our \"system\" was the reservoir itself. The\nexample I did in class had heat leaving the reservoir, so that Q was negative. Thus the\nentropy change of the reservoir is also negative. The second law, however, guarantees\nthat there is a positive change in entropy somewhere else in the surroundings that will be\nas large, or larger, than this decrease.\n1B.7 Why does the entropy of a heat reservoir change if the temperature stays the\nsame?\nA heat reservoir is an idealization (like an ideal gas, a rigid body, an inviscid fluid, a\ndiscrete element mass-spring-damper system). The basic idea is that the heat capacity of\nthe heat reservoir is large enough so that the transfer of heat in whatever problem we\naddress does not apprecibly alter the temperature of the reservoir.\nIn grappling with\napproximations such as this it is useful to think about extreme cases. Therefore, suppose\nthe thermal reservoir is the atmosphere. The mass of the atmosphere is roughly 1019 kg\n(give or take an order of magnitude). Let us calculate the temperature rise due to the heat\ndumped into the atmosphere by a jet engine during a transcontinental flight. A large gas\nturbine engine might produce on the order of 100 MW of heat, so that the rise in\natmospheric temperature, δTatm , for the heat transfer Q associated with a 6 hour flight is\ngiven by\nM\ncpδTatm =\n×\n\n3600 × 108J .\natm\nSubstituting for the atmospheric mass and the specific heat gives a value for temperature\nchange of roughly 10-10 K.\nTo a very good approximation, we can say that the\ntemperature of this heat reservoir is constant and we can evaluate the entropy change of\nthe reservoir as Q/T.\n1B.8 How can the heat transfer from or to a heat reservoir be reversible?\nWe made the assumption that the heat reservoir is very large, and therefore it is a\nconstant temperature heat source or sink. Since the temperature is uniform there is no\nheat transfer across a finite temperature difference and this heat exchange is reversible.\nWe discussed this in the second example \"Heat transfer between two heat reservoirs\".\n1B.9 How can ∆S be less than zero in any process? Doesn't entropy always increase?\nThe second law says that the total entropy (system plus surroundings) always increases.\n(See Section 1.B.1). This means that either the system or the surroundings can have it\nentropy decrease if there is heat transfer between the two, although the sum of all entropy\nchanges must be positive.\nFor an isolated system, with no heat transfer to the surroundings, the entropy must always\nincrease.\n\n1B.10 If Q\nT = ∆S for a reservoir, could you add Q to any size reservoir and still get the\nsame ∆S?\nYes, as long as the system you were adding heat to fulfilled the conditions for being a\nreservoir.\n1B.11 What is the difference between the isothermal expansion of a piston and the\n(forbidden) production of work using a single reservoir?\nThe difference is contained in the word sole in the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second\nlaw given in Section 1.B.1 of the notes.\nFor the isothermal expansion the changes are:\na) The reservoir loses heat Q\nb) The system does work W (equal in magnitude to Q)\nc) The system changes its volume and pressure.\nd) The system changes its entropy (the entropy increases by Q/T).\nFor the \"forbidden\" process,\na) The reservoir loses heat Q\nb) The system does work W (= Q) and that's all the changes that there are.\nleave it to you to calculate the total entropy changes (system plus\nsurroundings) that occur in the two processes.\n1B.12 For the \"work from a single heat reservoir\" example, how do we know there is\nno ∆Ssurr?\nOur system was the heat reservoir itself. In the example we had heat leaving the\nreservoir, thus Q was negative and the entropy change of the reservoir was also negative.\nUsing the second law, it is guaranteed that somewhere else in the surroundings a positive\nentropy change will occur that is as large or larger than the decrease of the entropy of the\nreservoir.\n1B 13 How does a cycle produce zero ∆S? I thought that the whole thing about cycles\nwas an entropy that the designers try to minimize.\nThe change in entropy during a cycle is zero because we are considering a complete cycle\n(returning to initial state) and entropy is a function of state (holds for ideal and real\ncycles!).\nThe entropy you are referring to is entropy that is generated in the components of a non-\nideal cycle. For example in a real jet engine we have a non-ideal compressor, a non-ideal\ncombustor and also a non-ideal turbine. All these components operate with some loss and\ngenerate entropy - this is the entropy that the designers try to minimize. Although the\nchange in entropy during a non-ideal cycle is zero, the total entropy change (cycle and\nI\n\nheat reservoirs!) is ∆Stotal > 0. Basically the entropy generated due to irreversibilities in\nthe engine is additional heat rejected to the environment (to the lower heat reservoir). We\nwill discuss this in detail in Section 1.C.1.\n1B.14 On the example of free expansion versus isothermal expansion, how do we know\nthat the pressure and volume ratios are the same? We know for each that P2>P1\nand V2>V1.\nDuring the free-expansion no work is done and no heat is transferred (insulated system).\nThus the internal energy stays constant and so does the temperature. This means that\nP1V1 = P2V2 holds also for the free-expansion and that the pressure and volume ratios are\nthe same when comparing free-expansion to reversible isothermal expansion.\n1B.15 Where did ∆Ssystem = NRln\n\nV2\ncome from?\nV1\nWe were using the 1st and 2nd law combined (Gibbs) and in the example discussed there\nwas no change in internal energy (dU=0). If we then integrate dS = P/TdV using P/T =\nNR/V (with N being the number of moles of gas in volume V and R is the universal gas\nconstant) we obtain ∆Ssystem = NR ln(V2/V1)."

To illustrate these ideas, we use a\nCarnot cycle which is shown schematically at\nthe right. The engine operates between two heat\nreservoirs, exchanging heat\nQH with the high temperature reservoir at TH\nand QLwith the reservoir at TL..

In this situation:\nMaximum work for an engine working between T\nT\nH\nL\nand\n: W\nQ\nT\nT\ne\nHe\nL\nH\n= (\n)\n-\n\nAlso, for a reversible cycle of the engine,\nQ\nT\nQ\nT\nH\nH\nL\nL\n+\n= 0.\nThese constraints apply to all reversible heat engines operating between fixed temperatures.

This means that\nthe Carnot cycle efficiency is equal to or greater than the efficiency for any other cycle, with the\nequality only occurring if ∆Stotal = 0.\n\n1C-3\nMuddy points\nSo, do we lose the capability to do work when we have an irreversible process and\nentropy increases? (MP 1C.1)\nWhy do we study cycles starting with the Carnot cycle? Is it because I is easier to work\nwith? (MP 1C.2)\n1.C.2 The Thermodynamic Temperature Scale\nThe considerations of Carnot cycles in this section have not mentioned the working\nmedium. They are thus not limited to an ideal gas and hold for Carnot cycles with any medium.\nBecause we derived the Carnot efficiency with an ideal gas as a medium, the temperature\ndefinition used in the ideal gas equation is not essential to the thermodynamic arguments. More\nspecifically, we can define a thermodynamic temperature scale that is independent of the working\nmedium. To see this, consider the situation shown below in Figure C-1, which has three reversible\ncycles. There is a high temperature heat reservoir at T3 and a low temperature heat reservoir at T1.\nFor any two temperatures T T\n,\n, the ratio of the magnitudes of the heat absorbed and rejected in a\nCarnot cycle has the same value for all systems.\nWA\nWC\nA\nB\nC\nQ1\nQ3\nQ3\nQ1\nQ2\nT2\nT1\nT3\nQ2\nWB\nFigure C-1: Arrangement of heat engines to demonstrate the thermodynamic temperature scale\nWe choose the cycles soQ1 is the same for A and C.

The former are vertical, but we need to define the shape of\nthe latter. For an ideal gas, changes in specific enthalpy are related to changes in temperature by\ndh\nc dT\np\n=\n, so the shape of the cycle in an h-s plane is the same as in a T-s plane, with a scale\nfactor of cp between the two. This suggests that a place to start is with the combined first and\nsecond law, which relates changes in enthalpy, entropy, and pressure:\ndh\nTds\ndp\n=\n+ ρ .\nOn constant pressure curves dP=0 and dh\nTds\n=\n. The quantity desired is the derivative of\ntemperature, T, with respect to entropy, s, at constant pressure: ∂\n∂\nT\ns p\n(\n) . From the combined first\nand second law, and the relation between dh and dT, this is\n\n1C-6\n∂\n∂\nT\ns\nT\nc\np\np\n\n=\n(C.4.1)\nThe derivative is the slope of the constant pressure legs of the Brayton cycle on a T-s plane. For a\ngiven ideal gas (specific cp) the slope is positive and increases as T.\nWe can also plot the Brayton cycle in an h-s plane. This has advantages because changes\nin enthalpy directly show the work of the compressor and turbine and the heat added and rejected.\nThe slope of the constant pressure legs in the h-s plane is ∂\n∂\nh\ns\nT\np\n(\n) =\n.\nNote that the similarity in the shapes of the cycles in T-s and h-s planes is true for ideal\ngases only. As we will see when we examine two-phase cycles, the shapes look quite different in\nthese two planes when the medium is not an ideal gas.\nPlotting the cycle in T-s coordinates also allows another way to address the evaluation of\nthe Brayton cycle efficiency which gives insight into the relations between Carnot cycle efficiency\nand efficiency of other cycles. As shown in Figure C-2, we can break up the Brayton cycle into\nmany small Carnot cycles. The \"\n\"\nith Carnot cycle has an efficiency of ηci\nlowi\nhighi\nT\nT\n=\n-(\n)\n[\n]\n,\nwhere the indicated lower temperature is the heat rejection temperature for that elementary cycle\nand the higher temperature is the heat absorption temperature for that cycle. The upper and lower\ncurves of the Brayton cycle, however, have constant pressure. All of the elementary Carnot cycles\ntherefore have the same pressure ratio:\nP T\nP T\nPR\nhigh\nlow\n(\n)\n(\n)\n=\n= constant (the same for all the cycles).\nFrom the isentropic relations for an ideal gas, we know that pressure ratio, PR, and temperature\nratio, TR, are related by : PR\nTR\nγ\nγ\n-\n(\n)\n=\n1 /\n.\n\n1C-7\nTmax\nTmin\nT\ns\nFigure C-2: Ideal Brayton cycle as composed of many elementary Carnot cycles [Kerrebrock]\nThe temperature ratios T\nT\nlowi\nhighi\n(\n) of any elementary cycle \"i\" are therefore the same and each of\nthe elementary cycles has the same thermal efficiency. We only need to find the temperature ratio\nacross any one of the cycles to find what the efficiency is. We know that the temperature ratio of\nthe first elementary cycle is the ratio of compressor exit temperature to engine entry (atmospheric\nfor an aircraft engine) temperature, T\nT\n/\nin Figure C-2. If the efficiency of all the elementary\ncycles has this value, the efficiency of the overall Brayton cycle (which is composed of the\nelementary cycles) must also have this value. Thus, as previously,\nηBrayton\ninlet\ncompressor exit\nT\nT\n= -\n\n.\nA benefit of this view of efficiency is that it allows us a way to comment on the efficiency\nof any thermodynamic cycle. Consider the cycle shown on the right, which operates between\nsome maximum and minimum\ntemperatures. We can break it up into small Carnot cycles\nand evaluate the efficiency of each. It can be seen that the\nefficiency of any of the small cycles drawn will be less than the\nefficiency of a Carnot cycle between Tmax and Tmin. This\ngraphical argument shows that the efficiency of any other\nthermodynamic cycle operating between these maximum and\nminimum temperatures has an efficiency less than that of a\nCarnot cycle.\nMuddy points\nIf there is an ideal efficiency for all cycles, is there a maximum work or maximum power\nfor all cycles?

Figure 1.3, p.8.\n\n1C-8\n1.C.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and \"Lost Work\"\nConsider a system in contact with a heat reservoir during a reversible process. If there is\nheat Q absorbed by the reservoir at temperature T, the change in entropy of the reservoir is\n∆S\nQ T\n=\n/\n. In general, reversible processes are accompanied by heat exchanges that occur at\ndifferent temperatures. To analyze these, we can visualize a sequence of heat reservoirs at\ndifferent temperatures so that during any infinitesimal portion of the cycle there will not be any\nheat transferred over a finite temperature difference.\nDuring any infinitesimal portion, heat dQrev will be transferred between the system and one of the\nreservoirs which is at T. If dQrev is absorbed by the system, the entropy change of the system is\ndS\ndQ\nT\nsystem\nrev\n=\n.\nThe entropy change of the reservoir is\ndS\ndQ\nT\nreservoir\nrev\n= -\n.\nThe total entropy change of system plus surroundings is\ndS\ndS\ndS\ntotal\nsystem\nreservoir\n=\n+\n= 0.\nThis is also true if there is a quantity of heat rejected by the system.\nThe conclusion is that for a reversible process, no change occurs in the total entropy produced, i.e.,\nthe entropy of the system plus the entropy of the surroundings: ∆Stotal = 0.\nWe now carry out the same type of analysis for an irreversible process, which takes the system\nbetween the same specified states as in the reversible process. This is shown schematically\nat the right, with I and R denoting the irreversible and reversible processes.\nIn the irreversible process, the system receives heat dQ and does work dW.\nThe change in internal energy for the irreversible process is\ndU\ndQ\ndW\n=\n-\n(Always true - first law).\nFor the reversible process\ndU\nTdS\ndWrev\n=\n-\n.\nBecause the state change is the same in the two processes\n(we specified that it was), the change in internal energy is the\nsame. Equating the changes in internal energy in the above two expressions yields\ndQ\ndW\nTdS\ndW\nactual\nactual\nrev\n-\n=\n-\n.\nIrreversible and reversible\nstate changes\n\n1C-9\nThe subscript \"actual\" refers to the actual process (which is irreversible). The entropy change\nassociated with the state change is\ndS\ndQ\nT\nT dW\ndW\nactual\nrev\nactual\n=\n+\n-\n[\n]\n.\n(C.5.1)\nIf the process is not reversible, we obtain less work (see IAW notes) than in a reversible process,\ndW\ndW\nactual\nrev\n<\n, so that for the irreversible process,\ndS\ndQ\nT\nactual\n>\n.\n(C.5.2)\nThere is no equality between the entropy change dS and the quantity dQ/T for an irreversible\nprocess. The equality is only applicable for a reversible process.\nThe change in entropy for any process that leads to a transformation between an initial state \"a\"\nand a final state \"b\" is therefore\n∆S\nS\nS\ndQ\nT\nb\na\nactual\na\nb\n=\n-\n≥∫\nwhere dQactual is the heat exchanged in the actual process. The equality only applies to a\nreversible process.\nThe difference dW\ndW\nrev\nactual\n-\nrepresents work we could have obtained, but did not. It is referred\nto as lost work and denoted by Wlost . In terms of this quantity we can write,\ndS\ndQ\nT\ndW\nT\nactual\nlost\n=\n+\n.\n(C.5.3)\nThe content of Equation (C.5.3) is that the entropy of a system can be altered in two ways: (i)\nthrough heat exchange and (ii) through irreversibilities. The lost work ( dWlost in Equation C.5.3) is\nalways greater than zero, so the only way to decrease the entropy of a system is through heat\ntransfer.\nTo apply the second law we consider the total entropy change (system plus surroundings). If the\nsurroundings are a reservoir at temperature T, with which the system exchanges heat,\ndS\ndS\ndQ\nT\nreservoir\nsurroundings\nactual\n=(\n) = -\n.\nThe total entropy change is\ndS\ndS\ndS\ndQ\nT\ndW\nT\ndQ\nT\ntotal\nsystem\nsurroundings\nactual\nlost\nactual\n=\n+\n=\n+\n\n-\n\n1C-10\ndS\ndW\nT\ntotal\nlost\n=\n≥0.\nThe quantity (dW\nT\nlost /\n) is the entropy generated due to irreversibility.\nYet another way to state the distinction we are making is\ndS\ndS\ndS\ndS\ndS\nsystem\nfrom\nheat\ntransfer\ngenerated due to\nirreversible\nprocesses\nheat transfer\nGen\n=\n+\n=\n+\n\n.\n(C.5.4)\nThe lost work is also called dissipation and noted dφ. Using this notation, the infinitesimal entropy\nchange of the system becomes:\ndS\ndS\nd\nT\nsystem\nheat transfer\n=\n+ φ\nor TdS\ndQ\nd\nsystem\nr\n=\n+ φ\nEquation (C.5.4) can also be written as a rate equation,\ndS\ndt\nS\nS\nS\nheat transfer\nGen\n=\n=\n+\n\n.\n(C.5.5)\nEither of equation (C.5.4) or (C.5.5) can be interpreted to mean that the entropy of\nthe system, S, is affected by two factors: the flow of heat Q and the appearance of\nadditional entropy, denoted by dSGen, due to irreversibility1. This additional entropy is\nzero when the process is reversible and always positive when the process is irreversible.\nThus, one can say that the system develops sources which create entropy during an\nirreversible process. The second law asserts that sinks of entropy are impossible in\nnature, which is a more graphic way of saying that dSGen and SGen are positive definite,\nor zero, for reversible processes.\nThe term\n,\n\nS\nT\ndQ\ndt\nQ\nT\nheat transfer\n\nor\n=\n\n, which is associated with heat transfer to\nthe system, can be interpreted as a flux of entropy. The boundary is crossed by heat and\nthe ratio of this heat flux to temperature can be defined as a flux of entropy. There are no\nrestrictions on the sign of this quantity, and we can say that this flux either contributes\ntowards, or drains away, the system's entropy. During a reversible process, only this flux\ncan affect the entropy of the system. This terminology suggests that we interpret entropy\nas a kind of weightless fluid, whose quantity is conserved (like that of matter) during a\nreversible process. During an irreversible process, however, this fluid is not conserved; it\ncannot disappear, but rather is created by sources throughout the system. While this\ninterpretation should not be taken too literally, it provides an easy mode of expression\nand is in the same category of concepts such as those associated with the phrases \"flux of\n\n1 This and the following paragraph are excerpted with minor modifications from A Course in\nThermodynamics, Volume I, by J. Kestin, Hemisphere Press (1979)\n\n1C-11\nenergy\" or \"sources of heat\". In fluid mechanics, for example, this graphic language is\nvery effective and there should be no objections to copying it in thermodynamics.\nMuddy points\nDo we ever see an absolute variable for entropy?

The surroundings are equivalent to a second reservoir at T0. For an amount of heat, Q,\ntransferred from the reservoir, the maximum work we could derive is Q times the thermal\nefficiency of a Carnot cycle operated between these two temperatures:\nMaximum work we could obtain = W\nQ\nT\nT\nmax\n/\n=\n-\n(\n)\n2 .\n(C.6.1)\nOnly part of the heat transferred can be turned into work, in other words only part of the heat\nenergy is available to be used as work.\nSuppose we transferred the same amount of heat from the reservoir directly to another reservoir at\na temperature T\nT\n<\n. The maximum work available from the quantity of heat, Q , before the\ntransfer to the reservoir at T1 is,\nW\nQ\nT\nT\nT T\nmax\n,\n/\n=\n-\n(\n); [Maximum work between T T\n,\n].\nThe maximum amount of work available after the transfer to the reservoir at T1 is,\nW\nQ\nT\nT\nT T\nmax\n,\n/\n1 0\n=\n-\n(\n); [Maximum work between T T\n,\n].\nThere is an amount of energy that could have been converted to work prior to the irreversible heat\ntransfer process of magnitude\n′\nE ,\n′ =\n-\n\n-\n-\n\n=\n-\n\nE\nQ\nT\nT\nT\nT\nQ T\nT\nT\nT\n,\nor\n′ =\n-\n\nE\nT\nQ\nT\nQ\nT\n.\n\n1C-12\nHowever, Q T\n/ 1 is the entropy gain of the reservoir at T1 and (-Q T\n/\n2) is the entropy decrease of the\nreservoir at T2. The amount of energy,\n′\nE , that could have been converted to work (but now\ncannot be) can therefore be written in terms of entropy changes and the temperature of the\nsurroundings as\n′ =\n+\n\n=\nE\nT\nS\nS\nT\nS\nreservoir\nat T\nreservoir\nat T\nirreversible heat transfer process\n∆\n∆\n∆\n\n′\nE = \"Lost work\", or energy which is no longer available as work.\nThe situation just described is a special case of an important principle concerning entropy changes,\nirreversibility and the loss of capability to do work. We thus now develop it in a more general\nfashion, considering an arbitrary system undergoing an irreversible state change, which transfers\nheat to the surroundings (for example the atmosphere), which can be assumed to be at constant\ntemperature,T0. The change in internal energy of the system during the state change is\n∆U\nQ\nW\n=\n-\n. The change in entropy of the surroundings is (with Q the heat transfer to the system)\n∆S\nQ\nT\nsurroundings = -\n.\nNow consider restoring the system to the initial state by a reversible process. To do this we need\nto do work, Wrev on the system and extract from the system a quantity of heat Qrev. (We did this,\nfor example, in \"undoing\" the free expansion process.) The change in internal energy is (with the\nquantities Qrev and Wrev both regarded, in this example, as positive for work done by the\nsurroundings and heat given to the surroundings)2\n∆U\nQ\nW\nrev\nrev\nrev\n= -\n+\n.\nIn this reversible process, the entropy of the surroundings is changed by\n∆S\nQ\nT\nsurroundings\nrev\n=\n.\nFor the combined changes (the irreversible state change and the reversible state change back to the\ninitial state), the energy change is zero because the energy is a function of state,\n∆\n∆\nU\nU\nQ\nW\nQ\nW\nrev\nrev\nrev\n+\n=\n=\n-\n+ -\n+\n(\n)\n.\nThus,\nQ\nQ\nW\nW\nrev\nrev\n-\n=\n-\n.\n\n2 In the above equation, and in the arguments that follow, the quantities Qrev and Wrev are both regarded\nas positive for work done by the surroundings and heat given to the surroundings. Although this is not in\naccord with the convention we have been using, it seems to me, after writing the notes in both ways, that\ndoing this gives easier access to the ideas. I would be interested in your comments on whether this\nperception is correct.\n\n1C-13\nFor the system, the overall entropy change for the combined process is zero, because the entropy is\na function of state,\n∆\n∆\n∆\nS\nS\nS\nsystem combined process\nirreversible process\nreversible process\n;\n\n=\n+\n= 0.\nThe total entropy change is thus only reflected in the entropy change of the surroundings:\n∆\n∆\nS\nS\ntotal\nsurroundings\n=\n.\nThe surroundings can be considered a constant temperature heat reservoir and their entropy change\nis given by\n∆S\nQ\nQ\nT\ntotal\nrev\n=\n-\n(\n)\n.\nWe also know that the total entropy change, for system plus surroundings is,\n\n∆\n∆\n∆\nS\nS\nS\ntotal\nirreversible\nprocess\nreversible\nprocess\nsystem surroundings\n=\n+\n\n+\nThe total entropy change is associated only with the irreversible process and is related to the work\nin the two processes by\n∆S\nW\nW\nT\ntotal\nrev\n=\n-\n(\n)\n.\nThe quantity W\nW\nrev -\nrepresents the extra work required to restore the system to the original\nstate. If the process were reversible, we would not have needed any extra work to do this. It\nrepresents a quantity of work that is now unavailable because of the irreversibility. The quantity\nWrev can also be interpreted as the work that the system would have done if the original process\nwere reversible. From either of these perspectives we can identify (W\nW\nrev -\n) as the quantity we\ndenoted previously as\n′\nE , representing lost work. The lost work in any irreversible process can\ntherefore be related to the total entropy change (system plus surroundings) and the temperature of\nthe surroundings by\nLost work =W\nW\nT\nS\nrev\ntotal\n-\n=\n0∆\n.\nTo summarize the results of the above arguments for processes where heat can be exchanged with\nthe surroundings at T0:\n1) W\nW\nrev -\nrepresents the difference between work we actually obtained and work that\nwould be done during a reversible state change.

The\nvelocity is denoted by c. There is no shaft\nwork and no heat transfer and the flow is\nsteady. Under these conditions we can use the\nfirst law for a control volume (the Steady Flow\nEnergy Equation) to make a statement about the\nconditions upstream and downstream of the valve:\nh\nc\nh\nc\nht\n+\n=\n+\n=\n/\n/\n,\nwhere ht is the stagnation enthalpy, corresponding to\na (possibly fictitious) state with zero velocity.\nThe stagnation enthalpy is the same at stations 1 and 2 if Q=W=0, even if the flow processes are\nnot reversible.\nFor an ideal gas with constant specific heats, h\nc T\nh\nc T\np\nt\np t\n=\n=\nand\n.

In deriving this result, use has\nonly been made of the first law, the equation of state, the speed of sound, and the definition of the\nMach number. Nothing has yet been specified about whether the process of stagnating the fluid is\nreversible or irreversible.\nWhen we define the stagnation pressure, however, we do it with respect to isentropic\ndeceleration to the zero velocity state.

(MP 1C.16)\nd) Entropy Generation, Irreversibility, and Cycle Efficiency\nAs another example, we show the links between entropy changes and cycle efficiency for an\nirreversible cycle. The conditions are:\ni) A source of heat at temperature, T\nii) A sink of heat (rejection of heat) at T0\niii) An engine operating in a cycle irreversibly\nDuring the cycle the engine extracts heat Q, rejects\nheat Q0 and produces work,W:\nW\nQ\nQ\n=\n-\n0.\n∆\n∆\n∆\nS\nS\nS\nengine\nsurroundings\n=\n+\n.\nThe engine operates in a cycle and the entropy\nchange for the complete cycle is zero.\nTherefore,\n∆\n∆\n∆\n∆\nS\nS\nS\nheat\nsource\nheat\nk\nSsurroundings\n=\n+\n+\nsin\n.\nThe total entropy change is,\n∆\n∆\n∆\nS\nS\nS\nQ\nT\nQ\nT\ntotal\nheat\nsource\nheat\nk\n=\n+\n= -\n+\nsin\n.\n\n1C-20\nSuppose we had an ideal reversible engine working between these same two temperatures, which\nextracted the same amount of heat, Q, from the high temperature reservoir, and rejected heat of\nmagnitude Q rev\nto the low temperature reservoir.

(MP 1C.19)\nIn a real heat engine, with friction and losses, why is ∆S still 0 if TdS=dQ+dφ?\n(MP 1C.20)\ne) Propulsive Power and Entropy Flux\nThe final example in this section combines a number of ideas presented in this subject and\nin Unified in the development of a relation between entropy generation and power needed to\npropel a vehicle. Figure C-3 shows an aerodynamic shape (airfoil) moving through the atmosphere\nat a constant velocity. A coordinate system fixed to the vehicle has been adopted so that we see\nthe airfoil as fixed and the air far away from the airfoil moving at a velocity c0. Streamlines of the\nflow have been sketched, as has the velocity distribution at station \"0\" far upstream and station \"d\"\nfar downstream. The airfoil has a wake, which mixes with the surrounding air and grows in the\nA0\nStreamlines (control surface)\nActual wake profile\nWake\nA2\nA1\n∆c\nc0\nFigure C-3: Airfoil with wake and control volume for analysis of propulsive power requirement\ndownstream direction. The extent of the wake is also indicated. Because of the lower velocity in\nthe wake the area between the stream surfaces is larger downstream than upstream.\nWe use a control volume description and take the control surface to be defined by the two stream\nsurfaces and two planes at station 0 and station d. This is useful in simplifying the analysis\nbecause there is no flow across the stream surfaces. The area of the downstream plane control\nsurface is broken into A1, which is area outside the wake and A2, which is the area occupied by\nwake fluid, i.e., fluid that has suffered viscous losses. The control surface is also taken far enough\naway from the vehicle so that the static pressure can be considered uniform. For fluid which is not\nin the wake (no viscous forces), the momentum equation is cdc\ndP\n= -\n/ρ. Uniform static pressure\ntherefore implies uniform velocity, so that on A1 the velocity is equal to the upstream value, c0.\nThe downstream velocity profile is actually continuous, as indicated. It is approximated in the\nanalysis as a step change to make the algebra a bit simpler. (The conclusions apply to the more\n\n1C-22\ngeneral velocity profile as well and we would just need to use integrals over the wake instead of\nthe algebraic expressions below.)\nThe equation expressing mass conservation for the control volume is\nρ\nρ\nρ\n0 0\n1 0\n2 2\nA c\nA c\nA c\n=\n+\n.\n(C.7.5)\nThe vertical face of the control surface is far downstream of the body. By this station, the wake\nfluid has had much time to mix and the velocity in the wake is close to the free stream value, c0.\nWe can thus write,\nwake velocity =\n=\n-\n(\n)\nc\nc\nc\n∆\n; ∆c c\n/\n.\n<<\n(C.7.6)\n(We chose our control surface so the condition ∆c c\n/\n<< was upheld.)\nThe integral momentum equation (control volume form of the momentum equation) can be\nused to find the drag on the vehicle.\nρ\nρ\nρ\n0 0\n1 0\n2 2\nA c\nDrag\nA c\nA c\n= -\n+\n+\n.\n(C.7.7)\nThere is no pressure contribution in Eq. (C.7.7) because the static pressure on the control surface is\nuniform. Using the form given for the wake velocity, and expanding the terms in the momentum\nequation out we obtain,\n\nρ\nρ\nρ\n0 0\n1 0\n0 2\nA c\nDrag\nA c\nA c\nc c\nc\n= -\n+\n+\n-\n+ (\n)\n[\n]\n∆\n(C.7.8)\nThe last term in the right hand side of the momentum equation, ρ2\nA\nc\n∆\n(\n) , is small by virtue of\nthe choice of control surface and we can neglect it. Doing this and grouping the terms on the right\nhand side of Eq. (C.7.8) in a different manner, we have\nc\nA c\nc\nA c\nA c\nc\nDrag\nA c\nc\n1 0\n1 0\n2 0\nρ\nρ\nρ\nρ\n[\n] =\n+\n-\n(\n)\n[\n] + -\n-\n{\n}\n∆\n∆\nThe terms in the square brackets on both sides of this equation are the continuity equation\nmultiplied by c0. They thus sum to zero leaving the curly bracketed terms as\nDrag\nA c\nc\n= -ρ2\n2 0∆.\n(C.7.9)\nThe wake mass flow is ρ2 A2 c2 = ρ2 A2 (c0 - ∆ c). All this flow has a velocity defect (compared to\nthe free stream) of ∆c, so that the defect in flux of momentum (the mass flow in the wake times\nthe velocity defect) is, to first order in ∆c,\nMomentum defect in wake = -ρ2\n2 0\nA c\nc\n∆, = Drag.\n\n1C-23\nThe combined first and second law gives us a means of relating the entropy and velocity:\nTds\ndh\ndP\n=\n-\n/ρ.\nThe pressure is uniform (dP=0) at the downstream station. There is no net shaft work or heat\ntransfer to the wake so that the mass flux of stagnation enthalpy is constant. We can also\napproximate that the condition of constant stagnation enthalpy holds locally on all streamlines.\nApplying both of these to the combined first and second law yields\nTds\ndh\ncdc\nt\n=\n-\n.\nFor the present situation, dh\ncdc\nc\nc\nt = 0\n;\n=\n∆ , so that\nT\ns\nc\nc\n∆\n∆\n= -\n(C.7.10)\nIn Equation (C.7.10) the upstream temperature is used because differences between wake\nquantities and upstream quantities are small at the downstream control station. The entropy can be\nrelated to the drag as\nDrag = ρ2\nA T\ns\n∆\n(C.7.11)\nThe quantity ρ2\n2 0\nA c\ns\n∆ is the entropy flux (mass flux times the entropy increase per unit mass; in\nthe general case we would express this by an integral over the locally varying wake velocity and\ndensity).\nThe power needed to propel the vehicle is the product of drag x flight speed, Drag\nco\n×\n.\nFrom Eq. (C.7.11), this can be related to the entropy flux in the wake to yield a compact\nexpression for the propulsive power needed in terms of the wake entropy flux:\nPropulsive power needed =T\nA c\ns\nT\nEntropy flux in wake\n2 0\nρ\n∆\n(\n) =\n×\n\n(C.7.12)\nThis amount of work is dissipated per unit time in connection with sustaining the vehicle motion.\nEquation (C.7.12) is another demonstration of the relation between lost work and entropy\ngeneration, in this case manifested as power that needs to be supplied because of dissipation in the\nwake.\nMuddy points\nIs it safe to say that entropy is the tendency for a system to go into disorder? (MP 1C.21)\n1.C.8 Some Overall Comments on Entropy, Reversible and Irreversible Processess\n[Mainly excerpted (with some alterations) from: Engineering Thermodynamics, William\nC. Reynolds and Henry C. Perkins, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1977]\n\nMuddy points\nIsn't it possible for the mixing of two gases to go from the final state to the initial\nstate? If you have two gases in a box, they should eventually separate by density,\nright? (MP 1C.22)\n\nMuddiest Points on Part 1C\n1C.1 So, do we lose the capability to do work when we have an irreversible process and\nentropy increases?\nAbsolutely. We will see this in a more general fashion very soon. The idea of lost work\nis one way to view what \"entropy is all about\"!\n1C.2 Why do we study cycles starting with the Carnot cycle? Is it because it is easier to\nwork with?\nCarnot cycles are the best we can do in terms of efficiency. We use the Carnot cycle as a\nstandard against which all other cycles are compared. We will see in class that we can\nbreak down a general cycle into many small Carnot cycles. Doing this we can gain\ninsight in which direction the design of efficient cycles should go.\n1C.3 How does one interpret h-s diagrams?\nI find h-s diagrams useful, especially in dealing with propulsion systems, because the\ndifference in stagnation h can be related (from the Steady Flow Energy Equation) to shaft\nwork and heat input. For processes that just have shaft work (compressors or turbines)\nthe change in stagnation enthalpy is the shaft work. For processes that just have heat\naddition or rejection at constant pressure, the change in stagnation enthalpy is the heat\naddition or rejection.\n1C.4 Is it always OK to \"switch\" T-s and h-s diagram?\nNo! This is only permissible for perfect gases with constant specific heats. We will see,\nwhen we examine cycles with liquid-vapor mixtures, that the h-s diagrams and the T-s\ndiagrams look different.\n1C.5 What is the best way to become comfortable with T-s diagrams?\nI think working with these diagrams may be the most useful way to achieve this\nobjective. In doing this, the utility of using these coordinates (or h-s coordinates) should\nalso become clearer. I find that I am more comfortable with T-s or h-s diagrams than\nwith P-v diagrams, especially the latter because it conveys several aspects of interest to\npropulsion engineers: work produced or absorbed, heat produced or absorbed, and loss.\n1C.6 What is a reversible adiabat physically?\nLet's pick an example process involving a chamber filled with a compressible gas and a\npiston. We assume that the chamber is insulated (so no heat-transfer to or from the\nchamber) and the process is thus adiabatic. Let us also assume that the piston is ideal,\nsuch that there is no friction between the walls of the chamber and the piston. The gas is\n\nat some Temperature T1. We now push the piston in and compress the gas. The internal\nenergy of the system will then increase by the amount of work we put in and the gas will\nheat up and be at higher pressure. If we now let the piston expand again, it will return to\nits original position (no friction, ideal piston) and the work we took from the environment\nwill be returned (we get the exact same amount of work back and leave no mark on the\nenvironment). Also, the temperature and the pressure of the gas return to the initial\nvalues. We thus have an adiabatic reversible process. For both compression and\nexpansion we have no change in entropy of the system because there is no heat transfer\nand also no irreversibility. If we now draw this process in the h-s or T-s diagram we get a\nvertical line since the entropy stays constant: S = constant or ∆S = 0 and we can also call\nthis process an isentropic process.\n1C.7 If there is an ideal efficiency for all cycles, is there a maximum work or maximum\npower for all cycles?\nYes. As with the Brayton cycle example, we could find the maximum as a function of\nthe appropriate design parameters.\n1C.8 Do we ever see an absolute variable for entropy? So far, we have worked with\ndeltas only.\nIt is probably too strong a statement to say that for \"us\" the changes in entropy are what\nmatters, but this has been my experience for the type of problems aerospace engineers\nwork on. Some values of absolute entropy are given in Table A.8 in SB&VW. We will\nalso see, in the lectures on Rankine cycles, that the entropy of liquid water at a\ntemperature of 0.01 C and a pressure of 0.6113 kPa has been specified as zero for\nproblems involving two-phase (steam and water) behavior.\n1C.9 I am confused as to dS\ndQrev\nT\n=\nas opposed to dS\ndQrev\nT\n≥\n.\nBoth of these are true and both can always be used. The first is the definition of entropy.\nThe second is a statement of how the entropy behaves. Section 1C.5 attempts to make\nthe relationship clearer through the development of the equality dS\ndQ\nT\ndW\nT\nlost\n=\n+\n.\n1C.10 For irreversible processes, how can we calculate dS if not equal to dQ\nT ?\nWe need to define a reversible process between the two states in order to calculate the\nentropy (see muddy point 3, above). See VN Chapter 5 (especially) for discussion of\nentropy or section 1C.5. If you are still in difficulty, come and see me.\n\n1C.11 Is ∆S path dependent?\nNo. Entropy is a function of state (see Gibbs) and thus ∆S is path independent. For\nexample we could have three different paths connecting the same two states and therefore\nhave the same change in entropy\n∆S path I = ∆S path II = ∆S path III .\n1C.12 Are Q rev and Wrev the Q and W going from the final state back to the initial state?\nYes. We have an irreversible process from state 1 to state 2. We then used a reversible\nprocess to restore the initial state 1 (we had to do work on the system and extract heat\nfrom the system).\n1C.13 Why do we find stagnation enthalpy if the velocity never equals zero in the flow?\nThe stagnation enthalpy (or temperature) is a useful reference quantity. Unlike the static\ntemperature it does not vary along a streamline in an adiabatic flow, even if irreversible.\nIt was thus the natural reference temperature to use in describing the throttling process.\nIn addition, changes in stagnation pressure are direct representations of the shaft work or\nheat associated with a fluid component. The enthalpy is not, unless we assume that\nchanges in KE are small. Measurement of stagnation temperature thus allows direct\nassessment of shaft work in a turbine or compressor, for example.\n1C.14 Why does Tt remain constant for throttling?\nBecause for a steady adiabatic flow with no shaft work done the Steady Flow Energy\nEquation yields constant stagnation enthalpy even though the flow processes might not be\nreversible (see notes). For a perfect gas h = cpT, thus the stagnation temperature remains\nconstant.\n1C.15 How do you tell the difference between shaft work/power and flow work in a\nturbine, both conceptually and mathematically?\nLet us look at the expansion of a flow through a turbine using both the control mass\napproach and the control volume approach. Using the control mass approach we can\nmodel the situation by tracking 1kg of air as follows: state 1 - before the expansion we\nhave 1kg of air upstream of the turbine. We then push the gas into the turbine and expand\nit through the blade rows. After the expansion we take 1kg of air out of the turbine and\nthe mass of air is downstream of the turbine - state 2. The work done by the gas is work\ndone by the turbine (blades moved around by the gas) plus the work done by pressures\n(flow work). Using the first law we can then write for the change of internal energy of\n1kg of air:\nu2 - u1 = - wshaft + p1v1 - p2v2\n(adiabatic turbine: dq = 0)\n\nWhen entering the turbine, the fluid has to push the surroundings out of the way to make\nroom for itself (it has volume v1 and is at p1) - the work to do this is +p1v1. When leaving\nthe turbine the fluid is giving up room and the work to keep that volume v2 at pressure p2\nis freed; thus -p2v2. We can then write for the shaft work\nwshaft = u1 + p1v1 - (u2 + p2v2).\nThe right hand side of the above equation is the change in enthalpy (h1 - h2). This is\nanother example to show how useful enthalpy is (enthalpy is the total energy of a fluid:\nthe internal energy plus the extra energy that it is credited with by having a volume v at\npressure p). The shaft work outputted by the turbine is equal to the change in enthalpy\n(enthalpy contains the flow work!).\nwshaft = h1 - h2.\nWe can also solve this problem by using the 1st law in general form (control volume\napproach).\n\n.\n.\n.\n. .\n\nd/dt{Σ ECV} = Σ Q + Σ Wshaft + Σ Wshear + Σ Wpiston + Σ m ( h + _ c2 + gz).\nNote that in this form the flow work is buried in h already! For this turbine, we can drop\nthe unsteady term on the left and neglect heat fluxes (adiabatic turbine), shear work and\npiston work (no pistons but blades, so we keep the shaft work). Further we assume that\nchanges in potential energy and kinetic energy are negligible and we obtain for 1kg/s air\n0 = - wshaft + h1 - h2.\nWe obtain the same result as before: wshaft = h1 - h2.\n1C.16 Is the entropy change in the equations two lines above the total entropy change? If\nso, why does it say ∆Satm?\nThe entropy change in question is the entropy change due to the heat produced by friction\nonly.\n∆S\nQ\nT\nW\nW\nT\natm\nonly\nfriction\natm\nsystem\nreceived\natm\n(\n)\n=\n=\n-\n(\n)\ndue to frictional\nwork\n.\n1C.17 Why does ∆Sirrev=∆Stotal in this example?\nWhen we wrote this equality, we were considering a system that was returned to its\noriginal state, so that there were no changes in any of the system properties. All evidence\nof irreversibility thus resides in the surroundings.\n1C.18 In discussing the terms \"closed system\" and \"isolated system\", can you assume that\nyou are discussing a cycle or not?\n\nThe terms closed system and isolated system have no connection to whether we are\ndiscussing a cycle or not. They are attributes of a system (any system), whether\nundergoing cyclic behavior, one-way transitions, or just sitting there.\n1C.19 Does a cycle process have to have ∆S=0?\nEntropy is a state function. If the process is cyclic, initial and final states are the same.\nSo, for a cyclic process, ∆S = 0.\n1C.20 In a real heat engine, with friction and losses, why is ∆S still 0 if TdS=dQ+dφ?\nThe change in entropy during a real cycle is zero because we are considering a complete\ncycle (returning to initial state) and entropy is a function of state (holds for both ideal and\nreal cycles!). Thus if we integrate dS = dQ/T + dΦ/T around the real cycle we will obtain\n∆Scycle = 0. What essentially happens is that all irreversibilities (dΦ's) are turned into\nadditional heat that is rejected to the environment. The amount of heat rejected in the real\ncycle QR\nreal is going to be larger than the amount of heat rejected in an ideal cycle QR\nideal\nQR\nideal = QA TR/TA\n(from ∆Scycle = 0)\nQR\nreal = QA TR/TA + TR∆SΦ\n(from ∆Scycle = 0)\nWe will see this better using the T-s diagram. The change of entropy of the surroundings\n(heat reservoirs) is ∆Ssurr = -QA/TA + QR\nreal/TR = ∆SΦ > 0. So ∆Scycle = 0 even for real\ncycles, but ∆Stotal = ∆Scycle + ∆Ssurr = ∆SΦ > 0.\n1C.21 Is it safe to say that entropy is the tendency for a system to go into disorder?\nEntropy can be given this interpretation from a statistical perspective, and this provides a\ndifferent, and insightful view of this property. At the level in which we have engaged the\nconcept, however, we focus on the macroscopic properties of systems, and there is no\nneed to address the idea of order and disorder ; as we will see, entropy is connected to the\nloss of our ability to do work, and that is sufficient to make it a concept of great utility for\nthe evaluation and design of engineering systems. We will look at this in a later lecture. If\nyou are interested in pursuing this, places to start might be the book by Goldstein and\nGoldstein referred to above, Great Ideas in Physics by Lightman ( paperback book by an\nMIT professor), or Modern Thermodynamics, by Kondepudi and Prigogine.\n\n1C.22 Isn't it possible for the mixing of two gases to go from the final state to the initial\nstate? If you have two gases in a box, they should eventually separate by density,\nright?\nLet us assume that gas X is oxygen and gas Y is nitrogen. When the membrane breaks the\nentire volume will be filled with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. This may be\nconsidered as a special case of an unrestrained expansion, for each gas undergoes an\nunrestrained expansion as it fills the entire volume. It is impossible for these two\nuniformly mixed gases to separate without help from the surroundings or environment. A\ncertain amount of work is necessary to separate the gases and to bring them back into the\nleft and right chambers."

      "content": "1D-1\n1.D: Interpretation of Entropy on the Microscopic Scale - The Connection between\nRandomness and Entropy\n1.D.1 Entropy Change in Mixing of Two Ideal Gases\nConsider an insulated rigid container of gas separated into two halves by a heat conducting\npartition so the temperature of the gas in each part is the same. One side contains air, the other\nside another gas, say argon, both regarded as ideal gases. The mass of gas in each side is such\nthat the pressure is also the same.\nThe entropy of this system is the sum of the entropies of the two parts: S\nS\nS\nsystem\nair\non\n=\n+\narg\n.\nSuppose the partition is taken away so the gases are free to diffuse throughout the volume. For\nan ideal gas, the energy is not a function of volume, and, for each gas, there is no change in\ntemperature. (The energy of the overall system is unchanged, the two gases were at the same\ntemperature initially, so the final temperature is the same as the initial temperature.) The\nentropy change of each gas is thus the same as that for a reversible isothermal expansion from\nthe initial specific volume vito the final specific volume,vf . For a mass m of ideal gas, the\nentropy change is ∆S\nmR\nv\nv\nf\ni\n=\n(\n)\nln\n. The entropy change of the system is\n∆\n∆\n∆\nS\nS\nS\nm\nR\nv\nv\nm\nR\nv\nv\nsystem\nair\non\nair\nair\nf air\ni air\non\non\nf\non\ni\non\n=\n+\n=\n[\n] +\n[\n]\narg\narg\narg\narg\narg\nln (\n)\n( )\nln (\n)\n( )\n. (D.1.1)\nEquation (D.1.1) states that there is an entropy increase due to the increased volume that each\ngas is able to access.\nExamining the mixing process on a molecular level gives additional insight. Suppose we were\nable to see the gas molecules in different colors, say the air molecules as white and the argon\nmolecules as red. After we took the partition away, we would see white molecules start to move\ninto the red region and, similarly, red molecules start to come into the white volume. As we\nwatched, as the gases mixed, there would be more and more of the different color molecules in\nthe regions that were initially all white and all red. If we moved further away so we could no\nlonger pick out individual molecules, we would see the growth of pink regions spreading into the\ninitially red and white areas. In the final state, we would expect a uniform pink gas to exist\nthroughout the volume. There might be occasional small regions which were slightly more red\nor slightly more white, but these fluctuations would only last for a time on the order of several\nmolecular collisions.\nIn terms of the overall spatial distribution of the molecules, we would say this final state was\nmore random, more mixed, than the initial state in which the red and white molecules were\nconfined to specific regions. Another way to say this is in terms of \"disorder\"; there is more\ndisorder in the final state than in the initial state. One view of entropy is thus that increases in\nentropy are connected with increases in randomness or disorder. This link can be made rigorous\nand is extremely useful in describing systems on a microscopic basis. While we do not have\nscope to examine this topic in depth, the purpose of Section 1.D is to make plausible the link\nbetween disorder and entropy through a statistical definition of entropy.\n\n1D-2\n1.D.2 Microscopic and Macroscopic Descriptions of a System\nThe microscopic description of a system is the complete description of each particle in this\nsystem. In the above example, the microscopic description of the gas would be the list of the\nstate of each molecule: position and velocity in this problem. It would require a great deal of\ndata for this description; there are roughly 1019 molecules in a cube of air one centimeter on a\nside at room temperature and pressure. The macroscopic description, which is in terms of a few\n(two!) properties is thus far more accessible and useable for engineering applications, although it\nis restricted to equilibrium states.\nTo address the description of entropy on a microscopic level, we need to state some results\nconcerning microscopic systems. These, and the computations and arguments below are taken\nalmost entirely from the excellent discussion in Chapter 6 of Engineering Thermodynamics by\nReynolds and Perkins (1977)*.\nFor a given macroscopic system, there are many microscopic states. A key idea from quantum\nmechanics is that the states of atoms, molecules, and entire systems are discretely quantized.\nThis means that a system of particles under certain constraints, like being in a box of a specified\nsize, or having a fixed total energy, can exist in a finite number of allowed microscopic states.\nThis number can be very big, but it is finite.\nThe microstates of the system keep changing with time from one quantum state to another as\nmolecules move and collide with one another. The probability for the system to be in a particular\nquantum state is defined by its quantum-state probability pi. The set of the pi is called the\ndistribution of probability. The sum of the probabilities of all the allowed quantum states must be\nunity, hence for any time t,\npi\ni\n=\n∑\n(D.2.1)\nWhen the system reaches equilibrium, the individual molecules still change from one quantum\nstate to another. In equilibrium, however, the system state does not change with time; so the\nprobabilities for the different quantum states are independent of time. This distribution is then\ncalled the equilibrium distribution, and the probability pi can be viewed as the fraction of time a\nsystem spends in the ithquantum state. In what follows, we limit consideration to equilibrium\nstates.\nWe can get back to macroscopic quantities from the microscopic description using the\nprobability distribution. For instance, the macroscopic energy of the system would be the\nweighted average of the successive energies of the system (the energies of the quantum states);\nweighted by the relative time the system spends in the corresponding microstates. In terms of\nprobabilities, the average energy, E , is\nE\npi\ni\ni\n= ∑\nε , where\niε is the energy of a quantum state.\n(D.2.2)\n\n* Reynolds, W.C., and Perkins, H.C., Engineering Thermodynamics, McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1977.\n\n1D-3\nThe probability distribution provides information on the randomness of the equilibrium quantum\nstates. For example, suppose the system can only exist in three states (1, 2 and 3). If the\ndistribution probability is\np1=1,\np2=0,\np3=0\nthe system is in quantum state 1 and there is no randomness. If we were asked what quantum\nstate the system is in, we would be able to say it is always in state 1. If the distribution were\np1=0.3,\np2=0.2,\np3=0.5\nor\np1=0.5,\np2=0.2,\np3=0.3\nthe randomness would not be zero and would be equal in both cases. We would be more\nuncertain about the instantaneous quantum state than in the first situation.\nMaximum randomness corresponds to the case where the three states are equally probable:\np1=1/3,\np2=1/3,\np3=1/3\nIn this case, we can only guess the instantaneous state with 33 per cent probability.\n1.D.3 A Statistical Definition of Entropy\nThe list of the pi is a precise description of the randomness in the system, but the number of\nquantum states in almost any industrial system is so high this list is not useable. We thus look\nfor a single quantity, which is a function of the pi that gives an appropriate measure of the\nrandomness of a system. As shown below, the entropy provides this measure.\nThere are several attributes that the sought for function should have. The first is that the average\nof the function over all of the microstates should have an extensive behavior, in other words the\nmicroscopic description of the entropy of a system C, composed of parts A and B is given by\nS\nS\nS\nC\nA\nB\n=\n+\n.\n(D.3.1)\nSecond is that entropy should increase with randomness and should be largest for a given energy\nwhen all the quantum states are equiprobable.\nThe average of the function over all the microstates is defined by\nS\nf\np f p\ni\ni\ni\n=\n= ∑\n( )\n(D.3.2)\nwhere the function f pi\n( ) is to be found. Suppose that system A has n microstates and system B\nhas m microstates. The entropies of systems A, B, and C, are defined by\n\n1D-4\nS\np f p\nA\ni\ni\ni\nn\n=\n( )\n∑\n=1\n(D.3.3a)\nS\np f p\nB\nj\nj\nj\nm\n=\n( )\n∑\n=1\n(D.3.3b)\nS\np f p\np f p\np f p\nC\nij\nij\nj\nm\ni\nn\ni\ni\ni\nn\nj\nj\nj\nm\n=\n(\n) =\n∑\n∑\n( )\n∑\n( )\n∑\n=\n=\n=\n=\n(D.3.3c)\nIn Equations (D.3.2 and D.3.3), the term pij means the probability of a microstate in which\nsystem A is in state i and system B is in state j.\nFor Equation (D.3.1) to hold,\nS\np f p\np f p\np f p\np f p\nS\nS\nC\ni\ni\ni\nn\nj\nj\nj\nm\ni\ni\ni\nn\nj\nj\nj\nm\nA\nB\n=\n( )\n∑\n( )\n∑\n=\n( )\n∑\n+\n( )\n∑\n=\n+\n=\n=\n=\n=\n.\n(D.3.4)\nThe function f must be such that this is true regardless of the values of the probabilities\np\np\ni\nj\nand\n. This will occur if f( ) =\n( )\nln\nbecause ln\nln\nln\na b\na\nb\n⋅\n(\n) =\n( ) +\n( ). Making this\nsubstitution, the expression for Sc in Equation (D.3.4) becomes\np p\np\np p\np\ni\nj\ni\nj\nm\ni\nn\ni\nj\nj\nj\nm\ni\nn\nln\nln\n( ) +\n∑\n∑\n( )\n∑\n∑\n=\n=\n=\n=\n.\n(D.3.5a)\nRearranging the sums, D.3.5a becomes\np\np\np\np\np\np\ni\ni\nj\nj\nm\ni\nn\nj\nj\ni\ni\nn\nj\nm\nln\nln\n( ) ∑\n\n∑\n+\n( ) ∑\n\n∑\n=\n=\n=\n=\n.\n(D.3.5b)\nBecause\np\np\ni\ni\nn\nj\nj\nm\n=\n=\n∑\n= ∑\n=\n1,\n(D.3.6)\nthe left hand side of Equation (D.3.4) can be written as\nS\np\np\np\np\nC\ni\ni\ni\nn\nj\nj\nj\nm\n=\n( ) +\n∑\n( )\n∑\n=\n=\nln\nln\n.\n(D.3.7)\nThis means that Equation (D.3.4) is satisfied for any p\np\nn m\ni\nj\n,\n,\n,\n\n. Reynolds and Perkins show\nthat the most general f pi\n( ) is f\nC\npi\n=\n( )\nln\n, where C is an arbitrary constant. Because the pi are\nless than unity, the constant is chosen to be negative to make the entropy positive.\nBased on the above a the statistical definition of entropy can be given as:\nS\nk\np\np\ni\ni\ni\n= -∑\nln\n.\n(D.3.8)\n\n1D-5\nThe constant k is known as the Boltzmann constant,\nk\nJ\nK\n=\n×\n-\n1 380\n10 23\n.\n.\n(D.3.9)\nThe value of k is (another wonderful result!) given by k =R/ NAvogadro, where R is the universal\ngas constant, 8.3143 J/(mol-K) and NAvogadro is Avogadro's number, 6 02\n.\n×\nmolecules per\nmol. Sometimes k is called the gas constant per molecule. With this value for k, the statistical\ndefinition of entropy is identical with the macroscopic definition of entropy.\n1.D.4 Connection between the Statistical Definition of Entropy and Randomness\nWe need now to examine the behavior of the statistical definition of entropy as regards\nrandomness. Because a uniform probability distribution reflects the largest randomness, a\nsystem with n allowed states will have the greatest entropy when each state is equally likely. In\nthis situation, the probabilities become\np\np\ni =\n= 1\nΩ,\n(D.4.1)\nwhere Ω is the total number of microstates. The entropy is thus\nS\nk\nk\nk\ni\n= -∑\n\n= -\n\n= -\n\n=\n1Ω\nΩ\nΩΩ\nΩ\nΩ\nΩ\nln\nln\nln\nS\nk\n=\nlnΩ.\n(D.4.2)\nEquation (D.4.1) states that the larger the number of possible states the larger the entropy.\nThe behavior of the entropy stated in Equation (D.4.2) can be summarized as follows:\na) S is maximum when Ω is maximum, which means many permitted quantum states,\nhence much randomness,\nb) S is minimum when Ω is minimum. In particular, for Ω=1, there is no randomness\nand S=0.\nThese trends are in accord with our qualitative ideas concerning randomness. Equation (D.4.2)\nis carved on Boltzmann's tombstone (he died about a hundred years ago) in Vienna.\nWe can also examine the additive property of entropy with respect to probabilities. If we have\ntwo systems, A and B, which are viewed as a combined system, C, the quantum states for the\ncombined system are the combinations of the quantum states from A and B. The quantum state\nwhere A is in its state x and B in its state y would have a probability p\np\nAx\nBy\n⋅\nbecause the two\nprobabilities are independent. The number of probabilities for the combined system, ΩC, is thus\ndefined by Ω\nΩ\nΩ\nC\nA\nB\n=\n⋅\n. The entropy of the combined system is\n\n1D-6\nS\nk\nk\nk\nS\nS\nC\nA\nB\nA\nB\nA\nB\n=\n⋅\n(\n) =\n+\n=\n+\nln\nln\nln\nΩ\nΩ\nΩ\nΩ\n(D.4.3)\nEquation (D.4.2) is sometimes taken as the basic definition of entropy, but it should be\nremembered that it is only appropriate when each quantum state is equally likely. Equation\n(D.3.8) is more general and applies equally for equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations.\nA simple numerical example shows trends in entropy changes and randomness for a system\nwhich can exist in three states. Consider the five probability distributions\ni)\np\np\np\n1 0\n=\n=\n=\n. ,\n,\n\n; S\nk\n= -\n+\n+\n(\n) =\nln\nln\nln\nii) p\np\np\n0 8\n0 2\n=\n=\n=\n. ,\n. ,\n\n; S\nk\nk\n= -\n(\n) +\n(\n) +\n( )\n[\n] =\n0 8\n0 8\n0 2\n0 2\n0 500\n. ln\n.\n. ln\n.\nln\n.\niii) p\np\np\n0 8\n0 1\n0 1\n=\n=\n=\n. ,\n. ,\n.\n\n; S\nk\nk\n= -\n(\n) +\n(\n) +\n(\n)\n[\n] =\n0 8\n0 8\n0 1\n0 1\n0 1\n0 1\n0 639\n. ln\n.\n. ln\n.\n. ln\n.\n.\niv) p\np\np\n0 5\n0 3\n0 2\n=\n=\n=\n. ,\n. ,\n.\n\n; S\nk\nk\n= -\n(\n) +\n(\n) +\n(\n)\n[\n] =\n0 5\n0 5\n0 3\n0 3\n0 2\n0 2\n1 03\n. ln\n.\n. ln\n.\n. ln\n.\n.\nv) p\np\np\n1 3\n1 3\n1 3\n=\n=\n=\n/ ,\n/ ,\n/\n\n; S\nk\nk\n= -\n\n=\n1 099\nln\n.\n.\nThe first distribution has no randomness. For the second, we know that state 3 is never found.\nStates (iii) and (iv) have progressively greater uncertainty about the distribution of states and\nthus higher randomness. State (v) has the greatest randomness and uncertainty and also the\nlargest entropy.\n1.D.5. Numerical Example of the Approach to the Equilibrium Distribution\nReynolds and Perkins give a numerical example which illustrates the above concepts and also the\ntendency of a closed isolated system to tend to equilibrium.\nReynolds and Perkins,Engineering Thermodynamics, McGraw-Hill, 1977. Sec. 6.7. pp.177-183.\n\n1D-7\n1.D.6 Summary and Conclusions\na) Entropy as defined from a microscopic point of view is a measure of randomness in a system.\nb) The entropy is related to the probabilities pi of the individual quantum states of the system by\nS\nk\np\np\ni\ni\ni\n= -∑\nln\nwhere k, the Boltzmann constant is given by R/ NAvogadro.\nc) For a system in which there are Ω quantum states, all of which are equally probable (for\nwhich the probability is pi = 1/Ω), the entropy is given by\nS\nk\n=\nlnΩ.\nThe more quantum states, the more the randomness and uncertainty that a system is in a\nparticular quantum state.\nd) From the statistical point of view there is a finite, but exceedingly small possibility that a\nsystem that is well mixed could suddenly \"unmix\" and that all the air molecules in the room\ncould suddenly come to the front half of the room. The unlikelihood of this is well described by\nDenbigh [Principles of Chemical Equilibrium, 1981] in a discussion of the behavior of an\nisolated system:\n\"In the case of systems containing an appreciable number of atoms, it becomes increasingly\nimprobably that we shall ever observe the system in a non-uniform condition. For example,\nit is calculated that the probability of a relative change of density, ∆ρ ρ, of only 0.001% in 1\ncm3 of air is smaller than 10 108\n-\nand would not be observed in trillions of years. Thus,\naccording to the statistical interpretation the discovery of an appreciable and spontaneous\ndecrease in the entropy of an isolated system, if it is separated into two parts, is not\nimpossible, but exceedingly improbable. We repeat , however, that it is an absolute\nimpossibility to know when it will take place.\"\n\n1D-8\ne) The definition of entropy in the form S\nk\np\np\ni\ni\ni\n= -∑\nln\narises in other aerospace fields, notably\nthat of information theory. In this context, the constant k is taken as unity and the entropy\nbecomes a dimensionless measure of the uncertainty represented by a particular message. There\nis no underlying physical connection with thermodynamic entropy, but the underlying\nuncertainty concepts are the same.\nf) The presentation of entropy in this subject is focused on the connection to macroscopic\nvariables and behavior. These involve the definition of entropy given in Section 1.B of the notes\nand the physical link with lost work, neither of which makes any mention of molecular\n(microscopic) behavior. The approach in other sections of the notes is only connected to these\nmacroscopic processes and does not rely at all upon the microscopic viewpoint. Exposure to the\nstatistical definition of entropy, however, is helpful as another way not only to answer the\nquestion of \"What is entropy?\" but also to see the depth of this fundamental concept and the\nconnection with other areas of technology."

Because of\nthese irreversibilities, we need more work, ∆hcomp (the changes in kinetic energy from inlet to exit\nof the compressor are neglected), to drive the compressor than in the ideal situation. We also get\nless work, ∆hturb, back from the turbine. The consequence, as can be inferred from Figure 2A-10\nbelow, is that the net work from the engine is less than in the cycle with ideal components.\nh\n5s\n3s\ns\nqR\nqA\nwturb\nT4 = Tmax\nT0 = Tinlet\nP3\nP0\nwcomp\nFigure 2A-10: Gas turbine engine (Brayton) cycle showing effect of departure from ideal\nbehavior in compressor and turbine\nTo develop a quantitative description of the effect of these departures from reversible\nbehavior, consider a perfect gas with constant specific heats and neglect kinetic energy at the\ninlet and exit of the turbine and compressor.

Note that the ratio is the actual work delivered divided by the\nideal work for the turbine, whereas the ratio is the ideal work needed divided by the actual work\nrequired for the compressor. These are not thermal efficiencies, but rather measures of the\ndegree to which the compression and expansion approach the ideal processes.\nWe now wish to find the net work done in the cycle and the efficiency. The net work is given\neither by the difference between the heat received and rejected or the work of the compressor\nand turbine, where the convention is that heat received is positive and heat rejected is negative\nand work done is positive and work absorbed is negative.\nNetwork =\nH\nheat in\nheat out\nturb\ncomp\nq\nq\nh\nh\nh\nh\nw\nw\nh\nh\nh\nh\nL\n{\n{\n+\n=\n-\n(\n) -\n-\n(\n)\n+\n=\n-\n(\n) -\n-\n(\n)\n\nThe thermal efficiency is:\nηthermal = Network\nHeat input\nWe need to calculate T3 , T5\nFrom the definition ofηcomp , T\nT\nT\nT\nT\nS\nc\nT S T\nc\n0 1\n-\n=\n-\n(\n) =\n-\n(\n)\nη\nη\nWith T S T\ncomp\ncomp\n(\n) =\n\n=\n-\n-\nisentropic temperature ratio =\nP\nP\nexit\ninlet\nγ\nγ\nγ\nγ\nΠ\nT\nT\nT\ncomp\ncomp\n=\n-\n\n+\n-\nΠ\nγ\nγ\nη\nSimilarly, by the definition of ηturb\next\ninlet\nP\nP\n=\nactual work received\nideal work for same\n, we can find T5 :\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nturb\nS\nturb\nS\nturb\nTurb\n-\n=\n-\n(\n) =\n-\n\n=\n-\n\n-\nη\nη\nη\nγ\nγ\nΠ\nT\nT\nT\nturb\nturb\n=\n-\n-\n\n-\nη\nγ\nγ\nΠ\n\n2A-16\nThe thermal efficiency can now be found:\nηthermal\nL\nH\nQ\nQ\nT\nT\nT\nT\n= +\n= -\n-\n-\nwithΠ\nΠ\nΠ\nc\nt\n=\n=\n, and τ\nγ\nγ\nS =\n-\nΠ\nthe isentropic cycle temperature ratio,\nη\nη\nτ\nη\nτ\nthermal\nturb\nS\ncomp\nS\nT\nT\nT\nT\n= -\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n-\n(\n) +\n\nor,\nη\nτ\nη\nη\nτ\nη\nτ\nthermal\nS\ncomp\nturb\nS\nc\nS\nT\nT\nT\nT\n=\n-\n\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n-\nThere are several non-dimensional parameters that appear in this expression for thermal\nefficiency.

The ideal analysis is too\nidealized in this regard. The highest efficiency also occurs closer to the pressure ratio for\nmaximum power than in the case of an ideal cycle. Choosing this as a design criterion will\ntherefore not lead to the efficiency penalty inferred from ideal cycle analysis.\n-\nThere is a strong sensitivity to the component efficiencies. For example, for\nη\nη\nturb\ncomp\n=\n= 0 85\n.\n, the cycle efficiency is roughly two-thirds of the ideal value.\n-\nThe maximum power occurs at a value of τ S or pressure ratio (Π ) less than that for\nmaxη .

In the lectures accompanying Section 2.C of the\nnotes, we will see how one can calculate the heat ,\nfuel\nh\n∆\n, liberated in a given reaction.\n2A.2 What are \"stoichiometric conditions\"?\nStoechiometric conditions are those in which the proportions of fuel and air are such that\nthere is not an excess of each one--all the fuel is burned, and all the air (oxidizer) is used\nup doing it. See Notes Sections 2.C.\n2A.3 When and where do we use cv and cp? Some definitions use dU=cvdT. Is it ever\ndU=cpdT?\nThe answer is no. The definitions of cp and cv are derived in the notes on page 0-6. cp is\nthe specific heat at constant pressure and for an ideal gas dh = cp dT always holds.\nSimilarly cv is the specific heat at constant volume and for an ideal gas du = cv dT always\nholds. A discussion on this is also given in the notes on pages 0-6 and 0-7. If you think\nabout how you would measure the specific heat c = q/(Tfinal - Tinitial) for a certain known\nchange of state you could do the following experiments.\nFor a process during which heat ∆q is transferred (reversibly) and the volume stays\nconstant (e.g. a rigid, closed container filled with a substance, or the heat transfer in an\nOtto engine during combustion - the piston is near the top-dead-center and the volume is\napproximately constant for the heat transfer) the first law is du = dq since v = const.\nUsing the definition du = cv dT we obtain for the specific heat at constant volume\ncv = ∆q/ ∆T ,\nwhere both the heat transferred ∆q and the temperature difference ∆T can be measured.\nSimilarly we can do an experiment involving a process where the pressure is kept\nconstant during the reversible heat transfer ∆q (e.g. a rigid container filled with a\nsubstance that is closed by a lid with a certain weight, or the heat transfer in a jet engine\ncombustor where the pressure is approximately constant during heat addition). The first\nlaw can be written in terms of enthalpy as dh - vdp = dq, and since p = const we obtain\ndh = dq. Using the definition dh = cpdT we obtain for the specific heat at constant\npressure\ncp = ∆q/ ∆T .\n\n2A.4 Explanation of the above comparison between Diesel and Otto.\nBasically we can operate the diesel cycle at much higher compression ratio than the Otto\ncycle because only air is compressed and we don't run into the auto-ignition problem\n(knocking problem). Because of the higher compression ratios in the diesel engine we get\nhigher efficiencies.\n2A.5 What is shaft work?\nI am not sure how best to answer, but it appears that the difficulty people are having\nmight be associated with being able to know when one can say that shaft work occurs.\nThere are several features of a process that produces (or absorbs) shaft work. First of all\nthe view taken of the process is one of control volume, rather than control mass (see the\ndiscussion of control volumes in Section 0 or in IAW). Second, there needs to be a shaft\nor equivalent device (a moving belt, a row of blades) that can be identified as the work\ncarrier. Third, the shaft work is work over and above the \"flow work\" that is done by (or\nreceived by) the streams that exit and enter the control volume.\n2A.6 What exactly is the specific impulse, Isp, a measure of?\nThe specific impulse is a measure of how well the fuel is used in creating thrust. For a\nrocket engine, the specific impulse is the effective exit velocity divided by the\nacceleration of gravity, g. In terms of relating the specific impulse to some characteristic\ntime, we can write the definition of Isp as\nF\ng\nm\nIsp\n=\n&\n.\nFrom this, one can regard the specific impulse as the time that it would take to flow a\nquantity of fuel that has a weight equal to the thrust force\n2A.7 How is Isp found for rockets in space where g ~ 0?\nThe impulse I given to a rocket is the thrust force integrated over the burn time.\nTraditionally, for the case of constant exhaust velocity cex, the specific impulse has been\nused Isp = I /(mp g) = cex / g0, where mp is the propellant mass and g0 is the Earth's surface\ngravity. Thus Isp is measured in seconds and is a force per weight flow. Often today,\nhowever, specific impulse is measured in units meters/second [m/s], recognizing that\nforce per mass flow is more logical. The specific impulse is then simply equal to the\nexhaust velocity Isp = cex.\n2A.8 Why does industry use TSCP rather than Isp? Is there an advantage to this?\nI am not sure why Thrust*Specific Fuel Consumption was originally used. The gas\nturbine industry uses TSFC; the rocket propulsion industry uses essentially its inverse,\nSpecific Impulse. Perhaps an advantage is that TSFC is a number of magnitude unity,\nwhereas specific impulse is not.\n\n2A.9 Why isn't mechanical efficiency an issue with ramjets?\nAs defined, the mechanical efficiency represents bearing friction, and other parasitic\ntorques on the rotating shaft in a gas turbine. The work associated with this needs to be\nprovided by the turbine, but does not go into driving the compressor. The ramjet has no\nshaft, and hence does not encounter this.\n2A.10 How is thrust created in a ramjet?\nYou can look at thrust in several ways. One is through the integral form of the\nmomentum equation, which relates thrust to the difference between exit and inlet\nvelocities, multiplied by the mass flow. Another way, however, is to look at the forces on\nthe ramjet structure, basically the summation of pressure forces on all the surfaces. I\nattempted to do this in class using the turbojet with an afterburner. For the ramjet, from\nthe same considerations, we would have an exit nozzle that was larger in diameter than\nthe inlet so that the structural area on which there is a force in the retarding direction is\nsmaller than the area on which there is a force in the thrust direction.\n2A.11 Why don't we like the numbers 1 and 2 for the stations? Why do we go 0-3?\nA common convention in the industry is that station 0 is far upstream, station 1 is after\nthe shock in the inlet (if there is one), station 2 is at inlet to the compressor (after the\ninlet/diffuser) and station 3 is after the compressor. In class, when we examined the\nramjet we considered no changes in stagnation pressure between 0 and 2, so I have used 0\nas the initial state for the compression process. It would be more precise to differentiate\nbetween stations 0 and 2, and I will do this where appropriate.\n2A.12 For the Brayton cycle efficiency, why does T3=Tt0?\nThe ramjet is operating as a Brayton cycle where ηb= 1 - Tinlet / T compressor exit. For the\nramjet discussed in class the inlet temperature is T0 and since there is no compressor (no\nmoving parts) the only compression we get is from diffusion. We assumed isentropic\ndiffusion in the diffuser and found for very low Mach numbers that the diffuser exit or\ncombustor inlet temperature T3 is Tt3. From first law we know that for a steady, adiabatic\nflow where no work is done the stagnation enthalpy stays constant. Assuming perfect gas\nwe thus get Tt0 = Tt3 = T3. So we can write for the ramjet thermal efficiency\nηb= 1 - T0 / Tt0 .\n2A.13 How can we idealize fuel addition as heat addition?\nThe validity of an approximation rests on what the answer is going to be used for. We\nare seeking basically only one item concerning combustor exit conditions, namely the\nexit temperature or the exit enthalpy. The final state is independent of how we add the\nheat, and depends only on whether we add the heat. If it is done from an electrical heater\nor from combustion, and if we neglect the change in the constitution of the gas due to the\n\ncombustion products (most of the gas is nitrogen) the enthalpy rise is the same no matter\nhow the temperature rise is achieved.\n2A.14a What is the relation between h\nh\nf h\nt4\nt3\nf\n-\n= ∆\nand the existence of the maximum\nvalue of Tt4?\nThe two are very different physical statements. The first is the SFEE (steady flow energy\nequation) plus the approximation that inlet and exit mass flows to the control volume are\nthe same. The heat received within the volume is represented by the quantity f hf\n∆\n,\nwhere ∆hf is the heat liberated per kilogram of fuel. The second statement is a\nrepresentation of the fact that the degree of completion of the reaction in the combustor\ndepends on temperature, so that even though the inlet temperature increases strongly as\nthe Mach number increases, the combustor exit temperature does not change greatly.\nThis is an attempt to represent a complex physical process (or set of processes) in an\napproximate manner, not a law of nature.\n2A.14b Why didn't we have a 2s point for the Brayton cycle with non-ideal components?\nIf we didn't, we should have, or I should at least have marked the point at which the\ncompressor exit would be if the compression process was isentropic.\n2A.15 What is the variable fstoich?\nfstoich is the fuel-to-air ratio for stoichiometric combustion, or in other words the fuel-to-\nair ratio for a chemically correct combustion process during which all fuel is burnt.\n2A.16 How can T\nT\nbe the maximum turbine inlet temperature?\nI agree that the T4/T0 is a temperature ratio. If we assume constant ambient temperature\nthen this ratio reflects the maximum cycle temperature. The main point was to emphasize\nthat the higher your turbine inlet temperature the higher your power and efficiency levels.\n2A.17 When there are losses in the turbine that shift the expansion in T-s diagram to\nthe right, does this mean there is more work than ideal since the area is\ngreater?\nWe have to be careful when looking at the area enclosed by a cycle or underneath a path\nin the T-s diagram. Only for a reversible cycle, the area enclosed is the work done by the\ncycle (see notes page 1C-5). Looking at the Brayton cycle with losses in compressor and\nturbine the net work is the difference between the heat absorbed and the heat rejected\n(from 1st law). The heat absorbed can be found by integrating TdS = dQ along the heat\naddition process. The heat rejected during the cycle with losses in compressor and turbine\nis larger than in the ideal cycle (look at the area underneath the path where heat is\nrejected, this area is larger than when there are no losses dsirrev = 0 - see also muddy point\n\n1C.1). So we get less net work if irreversibilities are present. It is sometimes easier to\nlook at work and heat (especially shaft work for turbines and compressors) in the h-s\ndiagram because the enthalpy difference between two states directly reflects the shaft\nwork (remember, enthalpy includes the flow work!) and / or heat transfer.\n2A.18a For an afterburning engine, why must the nozzle throat area increase if the\ntemperature of the fluid is increased?\nThe Mach number of the flow is unity at the throat with and without the afterburner\nlit. The ratio of static pressure to stagnation pressure at the throat is thus the same\nwith and without the afterburner lit. The ratio of static temperature to stagnation\ntemperature at the throat is thus the same with and without the afterburner lit.\nT\nT\nM\nP\nP\nM\nt\nt\n= +\n-\n=\n+\n-\n\n-\n(\n)\nγ\nγ\nγ\nγ\n;\n/\nThe flow through the throat is\nm\ncA\naA\nP\nRT\nRT A\nthroat\nthroat\nthroat\n=\n=\n=\nρ\nρ\nγ\n.\nThe flow through the throat thus scales as\n\n/\n/\n/\n/\nm\nm\nP\nT A\nP\nT A\nA B\nnoA B\nthroat\nA B\nthroat\nnoA B\n=\n\nFrom what we have said, however, the pressure at the throat is the same in both cases.\nAlso, we wish to have the mass flow the same in both cases in order to have the\nengine operate at near design conditions.

This can stall the engine, a serious consequence for a single\nengine fighter.\n2A.18b Why doesn't the pressure in the afterburner go up if heat is added?\nFrom discussions after lecture, the main point here seems to be that the process of\nheat addition in the afterburner, or the combustor, is not the same as heat addition to a\ngas in a box. In that case the density (mass/volume) would be constant and, from\nP\nRT\n= ρ\n, increasing the temperature would increase the pressure. In a combustor,\nthe geometry is such that the pressure is approximately constant; this happens because\n\nthe fluid has the freedom to expand so the density decreases. From the equation\nP\nRT\n= ρ\nif the temperature goes up, the density must go down.\n2A.18c Why is the flow in the nozzle choked?\nAs seen in Unified, choking occurs when the stagnation to static pressure\nratio P P\nt /\n(\n)gets to a certain value, 1.89 for gas with γ of 1.4. Almost all jet aircraft\noperate at flight conditions such that this is achieved. If you are not comfortable with\nthe way in which the concepts of choking are laid out in the Unified notes, please see\nme and I can give some references.\n2A.18d What's the point of having a throat if it creates a retarding force?\nAs shown in Unified, to accelerate the flow from subsonic to supersonic, i.e., to\ncreate the high velocities associated with high thrust, one must have a converging-\ndiverging nozzle, and hence a throat.\n2A.18e Why isn't the stagnation temperature conserved in this steady flow?\nHeat is added in the afterburner, so the stagnation temperature increases."

These\ncan be combined with gas turbine cycles to provide combined cycles which have higher efficiency\nthan either alone. They can also be used by themselves to provide power sources for both\nterrestrial and space applications. The topics to be covered are:\ni)\nBehavior of two-phase systems: equilibrium, pressure temperature relations\nii)\nCarnot cycles with two-phase media\niii)\nRankine cycles\niv)\nCombined cycles\n2.B.1 Behavior of Two-Phase Systems\nThe definition of a phase, as given by SB&VW, is \"a quantity of matter that is\nhomogeneous throughout\". Common examples of systems that contain more than one phase are a\nliquid and its vapor and a glass of ice water. A system which has three phases is a container with\nice, water, and water vapor.\nWe wish to find the relations between phases and the relations that describe the change of\nphase (from solid to liquid, or from liquid to vapor) of a pure substance, including the work done\nand the heat transfer. To start we consider a system consisting of a liquid and its vapor in\nequilibrium, which are enclosed in a container under a moveable piston, as shown in Figure 2B-1.\nThe system is maintained at constant temperature through contact with a heat reservoir at\ntemperature T, so there can be heat transfer to or from the system.\n(a)\nLiquid water\nLiquid water\nWater vapor\nWater vapor\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 2B-1: Two-phase system in contact with constant temperature heat reservoir\nFor a pure substance, as\nshown at the right, there is\na one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the temperature at which\nvaporization occurs and the pressure.\nThese values are called the saturation\npressure and saturation temperature\n(see Ch. 3 in SB&VW).\nP-T relation for liquid-vapor system\n\n2B-2\nThis means there is an additional constraint for a liquid-vapor mixture, in addition to the equation\nof state. The consequence is that we only need to specify one variable to determine the state of the\nsystem. For example, if we specify T then P is set. In summary, for two phases in equilibrium,\nP\nP T\n=\n( ). If both phases are present, any quasi-static process at constant T is also at constant P.\nLet us examine the pressure-volume behavior of a liquid-vapor system at constant temperature.\nFor a single-phase perfect gas we know that the curve would be Pv = constant. For the two-phase\nsystem the curve looks quite different, as indicated in Figure 2B-2.\nVolume, V\nPressure, P\nLiquid phase\nMixture ofliquid andvapor\nLiquid saturation curve\nVapor\nsaturationcurve\nCritical point\nVapor phase\nGas phase\nCritical isotherm\nD\nB\nA\nC\nFigure 2B-2 - P-v diagram for two-phase system showing isotherms\nSeveral features of the figure should be noted. First, there is a region in which liquid and vapor\ncan coexist. This is roughly dome-shaped and is thus often referred to as the \"vapor dome\".\nOutside of this regime, the equilibrium state will be a single phase. The regions of the diagram in\nwhich the system will be in the liquid and vapor phases respectively are indicated. Second is the\nsteepness of the isotherms in the liquid phase, due to the small compressibility of most liquids.\nThird, the behavior of isotherms at temperatures below the \"critical point\" (see below) in the\nregion to the right of the vapor dome approach those of an ideal gas as the pressure decreases and\nthe ideal gas relation is a good approximation in this region.\nThe behavior shown is found for all the isotherms that go through the vapor dome. At a high\nenough temperature, specifically at a temperature corresponding to the pressure at the peak of the\nvapor dome, there is no transition from liquid to vapor and the fluid goes continuously from a\nliquid-like behavior to a gas-type behavior. This behavior is unfamiliar, mainly because the\ntemperatures and pressures are not ones that we typically experience; for water the critical\ntemperature is 374oC and the associated critical pressure is 220 atmospheres.\n\n2B-3\nThere is a distinct nomenclature used for systems with more than one phase. In this, the terms\n\"vapor\" and \"gas\" seem to be used interchangeably. In the zone where both liquid and vapor exist,\nthere are two bounding situations. When the last trace of vapor condenses, the state becomes\nsaturated liquid. When the last trace of liquid evaporates the state becomes saturated vapor (or dry\nvapor). If we put heat into a saturated vapor it is referred to as superheated vapor. Nitrogen at\nroom temperature and pressure (at one atmosphere the vaporization temperature of nitrogen is 77\nK) is a superheated vapor.\nFigure 2B-3: Constant pressure curves in T-v coordinates showing vapor dome\nFigure 2B-3 shows lines of constant pressure in temperature-volume coordinates. Inside the vapor\ndome the constant pressure lines are also lines of constant temperature.\nIt is useful to describe the situations encountered as we decrease the pressure or equivalently\nincrease the specific volume, starting from a high pressure-low specific volume state (the upper\nleft-hand side of the isotherm in Figure 2B-2). The behavior in this region is liquid-like with very\nlittle compressibility. As the pressure is decreased, the volume changes little until the boundary of\nthe vapor dome is reached. Once this occurs, however, the pressure is fixed because the\ntemperature is constant. As the piston is withdrawn, the specific volume increases through more\nliquid evaporating and more vapor being produced. During this process, since the expansion is\nisothermal (we specified that it was), heat is transferred to the system. The specific volume will\nincrease at constant pressure until the right hand boundary of the vapor dome is reached. At this\npoint, all the liquid will have been transformed into vapor and the system again behaves as a\nsingle-phase fluid. For water at temperatures near room temperature, the behavior would be\nessentially that of a perfect gas in this region. To the right of the vapor dome, as mentioned above,\nthe behavior is qualitatively like that of a perfect gas.\nReferring to Figure 2B-4, we define notation to be used in what follows. The states a and c denote\nthe conditions at which all the fluid is in the liquid state and the gaseous state respectively.\nFigure 2B-3 available from:\nSonntag, Borgnakke and Van Wylen, Fundamentals of Thermodynamics,\n5th Ed., John Wiley & Sons.

The average specific volume for this condition is\nv - average specific volume of two-phase system.\nWe can relate the average specific volume to the specific volumes for liquid and vapor and the\nmass that exists in the two phases as follows. The total mass of the system is given by\ntotal mass =\nliquid mass + vapor mass =\nm\nm\nm\nf\ng\n=\n+\n.\nThe volume of the system is\nVolume of liquid =V\nm v\nf\nf\nf\n=\nVolume of vapor =V\nm v\ng\ng g\n=\nTotal volume =V\nm v\nm v\nf\nf\ng g\n=\n+\n.\nThe average specific volume,v , is the ratio of the total volume to the total mass of the system\nv\nm v\nm v\nm\nm\nf\nf\ng g\nf\ng\n=\n+\n+\n= average specific volume.\n\n2B-5\nThe fraction of the total mass in the vapor phase is called quality, and denoted by X.\nX\nm\nm\nm\ng\nf\ng\n=\n+\n= quality of a liquid-vapor system.\nIn terms of the quality and specific volumes, the average specific volume can be expressed as:\nv\nX v\nX\nv\ng\nf\n=\n⋅\n+\n-\n⋅\n(\n)\nIn reference to Figure 2B-5, ab\nv\nv\nac\nv\nv\nf\ng\nf\n=\n-\n=\n-\n,\n.\nab\nac\nv\nv\nv\nv\nX\nf\ng\nf\n=\n-\n-\n=\n= quality.\n(a)\nT\nL\nL-V\nT\nT\nV\np\na\nb\nc\nvg\nv\nv\nvf\n(b)\nFigure 2B-5: Liquid vapor equilibrium in a two-phase medium\n2.B.2 - Work and Heat Transfer with Two-Phase Media\nWe examine the work and heat transfer in quasi-static processes with two-phase systems.\nFor definiteness, consider the system to be a liquid-vapor mixture in a container whose volume can\nbe varied through movement of a piston, as shown in Figure 2B-5. The system is kept at constant\ntemperature through contact with a heat reservoir at temperature T. The pressure is thus also\nconstant, but the volume, V, can change. For a fixed mass, the volume is proportional to the\nspecific volume v so that point b in Figure 2B-5 must move to the left or the right as V changes.\nThis implies that the amount of mass in each of the two phases, and hence the quality, also changes\nbecause mass is transferred from one phase to the other. We wish to find the heat and work\ntransfer associated with the change in mass in each phase. The change in volume can be related to\nthe changes in mass in the two phases as,\ndV\nv dm\nv dm\ng\ng\nf\nf\n=\n+\n.\n\n2B-6\nThe system mass is constant ( m\nm\nm\nf\ng\n=\n+\n= constant ) so that for any changes\ndm\ndm\ndm\nf\ng\n=\n=\n+\n.\nWe can define the quantity dm fg\ndm\ndm\ndm\nfg\ng\nf\n=\n= -\n= mass transferred from liquid to vapor.\nIn terms of dm fg the volume change of the system is\ndV\nv\nv\ndm\ng\nf\nfg\n=\n-\n(\n)\n.\nThe work done is given by\ndW = PdV\n=\n-\n(\n)\nP v\nv\ndm\ng\nf\nfg.\nThe change in internal energy, ∆U , can be found as follows. The internal energy of the system\ncan be expressed in terms of the mass in each phase and the specific internal energy (internal\nenergy per unit mass, u) of the phase as,\nU\nu m\nu m\nf\nf\ng\ng\n=\n+\ndU\nu dm\nu dm\nu\nu\ndm\nf\nf\ng\ng\ng\nf\nfg\n=\n+\n=\n-\n(\n)\n.\nNote that the specific internal energy can be expressed in a similar way as the specific volume in\nterms of the quality and the specific enthalpy of each phase:\nu\nX u\nX\nu\ng\nf\n=\n⋅\n+\n-\n⋅\n(\n)\nWriting the first law for this process:\ndQ = dU + dW\n=\n-\n(\n)\n+\n-\n(\n)\nu\nu\ndm\nP v\nv\ndm\ng\nf\nfg\ng\nf\nfg.\n=\n+\n(\n) -\n+\n(\n)\n[\n]\nu\nPv\nu\nPv\ndm\ng\ng\nf\nf\nfg\n=\n-\n(\n)\nh\nh\ndm\ng\nf\nfg.\nThe heat needed for the transfer of mass is proportional to the difference in specific enthalpy\nbetween vapor and liquid. The pressure and temperature are constant, so that the specific internal\nenergy and the specific enthalpy for the liquid phase and the gas phase are also constant. For a\nfinite change in mass from liquid to vapor, m fg, therefore, the quantity of heat needed is\nQ\nh\nh\nm\nH\ng\nf\nfg\n=\n-\n(\n)\n= ∆ (enthalpy change).\n\n2B-7\nThe heat needed per unit mass, q, for transformation between the two phases is\nq\nQ\nm\nh\nh\nh\nfg\ng\nf\nfg\n=\n=\n-\n(\n) =\n.\nThe notation hfg refers to the specific enthalpy change between the liquid state and the vapor state.\nThe expression for the amount of heat needed, q, is a particular case of the general result that in\nany reversible process at constant pressure, the heat flowing into, or out of, the system is equal to\nthe enthalpy change. Heat is absorbed if the change is from solid to liquid (heat of fusion), liquid\nto vapor (heat of vaporization), or solid to vapor (heat of sublimation).\nA numerical example is furnished by the vaporization of water at 100oC:\ni)\nHow much heat is needed per unit mass of fluid vaporized?\nii)\nHow much work is done per unit mass of fluid vaporized?\niii)\nWhat is the change in internal energy per unit mass of fluid vaporized?.\nIn addressing these questions, we make use of the fact that problems involving heat and work\nexchanges in two-phase media are important enough that the values of the specific thermodynamic\nproperties that characterize these transformations have been computed for many different working\nfluids. The values are given in SB&VW in Tables B.1.1 and B.1.2 for water at saturated\nconditions and in Tables B.1.3, B.1.4, and B.1.5 for other conditions, as well as for other working\nfluids. From these:\n- At 100oC, the vapor pressure is 0.1013 MPa,\n- The specific enthalpy of the vapor, hg, is 2676 kJ/kg and the specific enthalpy of the\nliquid, hf , is 419 kJ/kg\n- The difference in enthalpy between liquid and vapor, hfg, occurs often enough so that it is\ntabulated also. This is 2257 kJ/kg,\n- The specific volume of the vapor is 1.6729 m3/kg and the specific volume of the liquid is\n0.001044.\nThe heat input to the system is the change in enthalpy between liquid and vapor, hfg, and is equal\nto 2.257 x 106 J/kg.\nThe work done is P v\nv\ng\nf\n-\n(\n) which has a value of\nP v\nv\ng\nf\n-\n(\n)=0.1013 x 106 x [1.629 - 0.001044] =0.169 x 106 J/kg.\nThe change in internal energy per unit mass (u fg) can be found from ∆u\nq\nw\n=\n-\nor from the\ntabulated values as 2.088 x 106 J/kg. This is much larger than the work done. Most of the heat\ninput is used to change the internal energy rather than appearing as work.\nMuddy points\n\n2B-8\nFor the vapor dome, is there vapor and liquid inside the dome and outside is it just liquid\nor just gas?

Figure 2B-6a gives the cycle in P-v coordinates, 2B-6b in T-s coordinates, and 2B-6c\nin h-s coordinates. The boundary of the region in which there is liquid and vapor both present (the\nvapor dome) is also indicated. Note that the form of the cycle is different in the T-s and h-s\nrepresentation; it is only for a perfect gas with constant specific heats that cycles in the two\ncoordinate representations have the same shapes.\na\na\nb\nb\nc\nc\nd\nd\ne\nT\nT2\nT2\nT2\nT1\nT1\nT1\ns1\ns2\ns\ns\nh\nf\ng\nh\na\nb\nc\nd\np\np2\np1\nv\n(a) p-v diagram\n(b) T-s diagram\n(c) h-s diagram\nFigure 2B-6: Carnot cycle with two-phase medium. (a) cycle in P-v coordinates, (b) cycle in T-s\ncoordinates, (c) cycle in h-s coordinates\nThe processes in the cycle are as follows:\ni)\nStart at state a with saturated liquid (all of mass in liquid condition). Carry out a reversible\nisothermal expansion to b (a b) until all the liquid is vaporized. During this process a\nquantity of heat qH per unit mass is received from the heat source at temperature T2.\nii)\nReversible adiabatic (i.e., isentropic) expansion (b c) lowers the temperature to T1.\nGenerally state c will be in the region where there is both liquid and vapor.\n\n2B-9\niii)\nIsothermal compression (c d) at T1 to state d. During this compression, heat qL per unit\nmass is rejected to the source at T1.\niv)\nReversible adiabatic (i.e., isentropic) compression (d a) in which the vapor condenses to\nliquid and the state returns to a.\nIn the T-s diagram the heat received, qH , is abef and the heat rejected, qL, is dcef. The net work is\nrepresented by abcd. The thermal efficiency is given by\nη =\n=\n= -\nw\nq\nabcd\nabef\nT\nT\nnet\nH\nArea\nArea\n.\nIn the h-s diagram, the isentropic processes are vertical lines as in the T-s diagram. The isotherms\nin the former, however, are not horizontal as they are in the latter. To see their shape we note that\nfor these two-phase processes the isotherms are also lines of constant pressure (isobars), since P =\nP(T). The combined first and second law is\nTds\ndh\ndp\n=\n-ρ .\nFor a constant pressure reversible process, dq\nTds\ndh\nrev =\n=\n. The slope of a constant pressure line\nin h-s coordinates is thus,\n∂\n∂\nh\ns\nT\nP\n\n=\n= constant; slope of constant pressure line for two-phase medium.\nThe heat received and rejected per unit mass is given in terms of the enthalpy at the different states\nas,\nq\nh\nh\nH\nb\na\n=\n-\nq\nh\nh\nL\nd\nc\n=\n-\n.

To obtain these the\napproach is to use the fact that s = constant during the expansion to find the quality at state c and\nthen, knowing the quality, calculate the enthalpy as h\nXh\nX h\ng\nf\n=\n+\n-\n(\n)\n.

These can be closely approximated by a boiler for the heat addition\nprocess and a condenser for the heat rejection. Further, an efficient turbine can produce a\nreasonable approach to reversible adiabatic expansion, because the steam is expanded with only\nsmall losses. The difficulty occurs in the compression part of the cycle. If compression is carried\nout slowly, there is equilibrium between the liquid and the vapor, but the rate of power generation\nmay be lower than desired and there can be appreciable heat transfer to the surroundings. Rapid\ncompression will result in the two phases coming to very different temperatures (the liquid\ntemperature rises very little during the compression whereas the vapor phase temperature changes\nconsiderably). Equilibrium between the two phases cannot be maintained and the approximation\nof reversibility is not reasonable.\nAnother circumstance is that in a Carnot cycle all the heat is added at the same temperature. For\nhigh efficiency we need to do this at a higher temperature than the critical point, so that the heat\naddition no longer takes place in the two-phase region. Isothermal heat addition under this\ncircumstance is difficult to accomplish. Also, if the heat source and the cycle are considered\ntogether, the products of combustion which provide the heat can be cooled only to the highest\ntemperature of the cycle. The source will thus be at varying temperature while the system requires\nconstant temperature heat addition, so there will be irreversible heat transfer. In summary, the\npractical application of the Carnot cycle is limited because of the inefficient compression process,\nthe low work per cycle, the upper limit on temperature for operation in the two-phase flow regime,\nand the irreversibility in the heat transfer from the heat source. In the next section, we examine the\nRankine cycle, which is much more compatible with the characteristics of two-phase media and\navailable machinery for carrying out the processes.\n\n2B-13\nMuddy points\nWhat is the reason for studying two-phase cycles?

The cycle is\nshown on P-v, T-s, and h-s coordinates in Figure 2B-8.\nThe processes in the Rankine cycle are as follows:\ni) d e: Cold liquid at initial temperatureT1 is pressurized reversibly to a high pressure\nby a pump. In this, the volume changes slightly.\nii) e a: Reversible constant pressure heating in a boiler to temperature T2\niii) a b: Heat added at constant temperature T2 (constant pressure), with transition of\nliquid to vapor\niv) b c: Isentropic expansion through a turbine.

The heat absorption takes place at constant pressure over\neab, but only the part ab is isothermal. The heat rejected occurs over cd; this is at both constant\ntemperature and pressure.\nTo examine the efficiency of the Rankine cycle, we define a mean effective temperature, Tm in\nterms of the heat exchanged and the entropy differences:\nq\nT\ns\nH\nm\n=\n∆\nq\nT\ns\nL\nm\n=\n∆.\nThe thermal efficiency of the cycle is\nηthermal\nm\nb\ne\nm\nc\nd\nm\nb\ne\nT\ns\ns\nT\ns\ns\nT\ns\ns\n=\n-\n(\n) -\n-\n(\n)\n-\n(\n)\n.\nThe compression and expansion processes are isentropic, so the entropy differences are related by\n\n2B-15\ns\ns\ns\ns\nb\ne\nc\nd\n-\n=\n-\n.\nThe thermal efficiency can be written in terms of the mean effective temperatures as,\nηthermal\nm\nm\nT\nT\n= -\n.\nFor the Rankine cycle, T\nT\nT\nT\nm\nm\n≈\n<\n,\n. From Equation (B.4.1), we see not only the reason that\nthe cycle efficiency is less than that of a Carnot cycle, but the direction to move in terms of cycle\ndesign (increased Tm2 ) if we wish to increase the efficiency.\nThere are several features that should be noted about Figure 2B-8 and the Rankine cycle in\ngeneral:\ni) The T-s and the h-s diagrams are not similar in shape, as they were with the perfect gas.\nThe slope of a constant pressure reversible heat addition line is, as derived in Section 1.C.4,\n∂\n∂\nh\ns\nT\np\n\n=\n. In the two-phase region, constant pressure means also constant temperature,\nso the slope of the constant pressure heat addition line is constant and the line is straight.\nii) The effect of irreversibilities is represented by the dashed line from b to ′c . Irreversible\nbehavior during the expansion results in a value of entropy. sc′.at the end state of the\nexpansion that is higher than sc. The enthalpy at the end of the expansion (the turbine exit)\nis thus higher for the irreversible process than for the reversible process, and, as seen for\nthe Brayton cycle, the turbine work thus lower in the irreversible case.\niii) The Rankine cycle is less efficient than the Carnot cycle for given maximum and minimum\ntemperatures, but, as said earlier, it is more effective as a practical power production\ndevice.\nMuddy points\nWhere does degrees Rankine come from?

First, it increases the mean temperature at which heat is added, Tm2 , thus\nincreasing the efficiency of the cycle (see Equation B.4.1). Second is that the quality of the two-\nphase mixture during the expansion is higher with superheating, so that there is less moisture\ncontent in the mixture as it flows through the turbine. (The moisture content at e is less than that at\n′e .) This is an advantage in terms of decreasing the mechanical deterioration of the blading.\nThe heat exchanges in the superheated cycle are;\nAlong abcd, which is a constant pressure (isobaric) process: q\nh\nh\nd\na\n2 =\n-\n.\nAlong ef: q\nh\nh\nf\ne\n1 =\n-\n, (< 0).\nThe thermal efficiency of the ideal Rankine cycle with superheating is\nηthermal\nd\na\ne\nf\nd\na\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\n=\n-\n-\n-\n(\n)\n-\nThis can be expressed explicitly in terms of turbine work and compression (pump) work as:\n\n2B-17\nηthermal\nd\ne\na\nf\nd\na\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\n=\n-\n-\n-\n(\n)\n-\n.\nCompared to the basic cycle, superheating has increased the turbine work, increased the mean\ntemperature at which heat is received, Tm2 , and increased the cycle efficiency.\nA comparison of the Carnot cycle and the Rankine cycle with superheat is given in Figure 2B-10.\nThe maximum and minimum temperatures are the same, but the average temperature at which heat\nis absorbed is lower for the Rankine cycle.\nT\nT1\nT2\ns\nf\ne\ng\nd\nc\nb\na\nf\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\n=Rankine\n= Carnot\nd\ne\ng\nf\nIsothermal\nIsentropic\nFigure 2B-10: Comparison of Rankine cycle with superheat and Carnot cycle\nTo alleviate the problem of having moisture in the turbine, one can heat again after an initial\nexpansion in a turbine, as shown in Figure 2B-11, which gives a schematic of a Rankine cycle for\nspace power application. This process is known as reheat. The main practical advantage of reheat\n(and of superheating) is the decrease in moisture content in the turbine because most of the heat\naddition in the cycle occurs in the vaporization part of the heat addition process.\nWe can also examine the effect of variations in design parameters on the Rankine cycle. Consider\nfirst the changes in cycle output due to a decrease in exit pressure. In terms of the cycle shown in\nFigure 2B-12, the exit pressure would be decreased from P\nP\ndP\nexit\nexit\nexit\nto\n-\n(\n). The original cycle\nis abcdea, and the modified cycle is abfgha.

Figure 2B-13 shows comparison of two\ncycles with different maximum pressure but the same maximum temperature, which is set by\nmaterials properties. The average temperature at which the heat is supplied for the cycle with a\nhigher maximum pressure is increased over the original cycle, so that the efficiency increases.\n\n2B-19\n2′\n3′ 3\n4′\nT\ns\na\nb\nb′Figure 2B-13: Effect of maximum boiler pressure on Rankine cycle efficiency\nMuddy points\nWhy do we look at the ratio of pump (compression) work to turbine work?

(MP 2B.11)\nWhy can't we harness the energy in the warm water after condensing the steam in a\npower plant? (MP 2B.12)\n2.B.6 Combined Cycles in Stationary Gas Turbine for Power Production\nThe turbine entry temperature in a gas turbine (Brayton) cycle is considerably higher than\nthe peak steam temperature. Depending on the compression ratio of the gas turbine, the turbine\nexhaust temperature may be high enough to permit efficient generation of steam using the \"waste\nheat\" from the gas turbine. A configuration such as this is known as a gas turbine-steam combined\ncycle power plant. The cycle is illustrated in Figure 2B-14.\nFigure 2B-14: Gas turbine-steam combined cycle [Kerrebrock, Aircraft Engines and Gas\nTurbines]\nThe heat input to the combined cycle is the same as that for the gas turbine, but the work output is\nlarger (by the work of the Rankine cycle steam turbine). A schematic of the overall heat engine,\nFigure 2B-14 available from:\nKerrebrock, Aircraft Engines and Gas Turbines, 2nd Ed. MIT Press. Figure 1.10, p14.\n\n2B-20\nwhich can be thought of as composed of an upper and a lower heat engine in series, is given in\nFigure 2B-15. The upper engine is the gas turbine (Brayton cycle) which expels heat to the lower\nFigure 2B-15: Schematic of combine cycle using gas turbine (Brayton cycle) and steam turbine\n(Rankine cycle) [Langston]\nengine, the steam turbine (Rankine cycle). The overall efficiency of the combined cycle can be\nderived as follows. We denote the heat received by the gas turbine as Qin and the heat rejected to\nthe atmosphere as Qout . The heat out of the gas turbine is denoted as Q1. The hot exhaust gases\nfrom the gas turbine pass through a heat exchanger where they are used as the heat source for the\ntwo-phase Rankine cycle, so that Q1 is also the heat input to the steam cycle. The overall\ncombined cycle efficiency is\nηCC\nin\nB\nR\nin\nW\nQ\nW\nW\nQ\n=\n=\n+\n,\nwhere the subscripts refer to combined cycle (CC), Brayton cycle (B) and Rankine cycle (R)\nrespectively.\nFrom the first law, the overall efficiency can be expressed in terms of the heat inputs and heat\nrejections of the two cycles as (using the quantity Q1 to denote the magnitude of the heat\ntransferred):\nηCC\nin\nout\nin\nin\nout\nin\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\nQ\n=\n-\n+\n-\n(\n) =\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n.\nFigure 2B-15 drawn from:\nLee Langston.

The combined cycle\nefficiency can thus be written as,\nη\nη\nη\nη η\nCC\nB\nR\nB\nR\n=\n+\n-\n; Combined cycle efficiency.\n(B.6.1)\nEquation (B.6.1) gives insight into why combined cycles are so successful. Suppose that the gas\nturbine cycle has an efficiency of 40%, which is a representative value for current Brayton cycle\ngas turbines, and the Rankine cycle has an efficiency of 30%. The combined cycle efficiency\nwould be 58%, which is a very large increase over either of the two simple cycles. Some\nrepresentative efficiencies and power outputs for different cycles are shown in Figure 2B-16.\nFigure 2B-16: Comparison of efficiency and power output of various power products [Bartol\n(1997)]\n2.B.7 Some Overall Comments on Thermodynamic Cycles\ni)\nThere are many different power and propulsion cycles, and we have only looked at a few of\nthese. Many other cycles have been devised in the search for ways to increase efficiency\nand power in practical devices.\nii)\nWe can view a given cycle in term of\nelementary Carnot cycles, as sketched in\nthe figure on the right. This shows that\nthe efficiency of any other cycle operating\nbetween two given temperatures will be\nless than that of a Carnot cycle.\nFigure 2B-16 drawn from:\nDominic Bartol, Keynote talk, 1997 International Gas Turbine Institute (IGTI) Turbo Expo.\n\n2B-22\niii)\nIf we view the thermal efficiency as\nηthermal\nAverage\nAverage\nT\nT\n= -(\n)\n(\n)\nheat rejected\nheat absorbed\n,\n(derived in Section 2.B.4), this means that we should accept heat at a high temperature and reject it\nat a low temperature for high efficiency. This objective must be tempered by considerations of\npractical application.\niv)\nThe cycle diagrams in T-s and h-s coordinates will only be similar if the working medium\nis an ideal gas. For other media (for example, a two-phase mixture) they will look\ndifferent.\nv)\nCombined cycles make use of the rejected heat from a \"topping\" cycle as heat source for a\n\"bottoming\" cycle. The overall efficiency is higher than the efficiency of either cycle.\n\nMuddiest Points on Part 2B\n2B.1 For the vapor dome, is there vapor and liquid inside the dome and outside is it just\nliquid or just gas? Is it interchangeable? Is it true for the plasma phase?\nThe vapor dome separates the two-phase region from the single-phase region. Inside, we\nhave a mixture of liquid and vapor. The peak of the vapor dome is called the critical\npoint. The left-hand side leg of the vapor dome (from the critical point) is called the\nsaturated liquid line along which the quality x is zero (purely liquid). The right-hand side\nleg is denoted the saturated vapor line and the quality x is one (purely vapor). For further\ndetails see the notes.\nHeating of a solid or liquid substance leads to phase transition to a liquid or gaseous state,\nrespectively. This takes place at a constant temperature for a given pressure, and requires\nan amount of energy known as latent heat. On the other hand, the transition from a gas to\nan ionized gas, i.e., plasma, is not a phase transition, since it occurs gradually with\nincreasing temperature. During the process, a molecular gas dissociates first into an\natomic gas which, with increasing temperature, is ionized. Resulting plasma consists of a\nmixture of neutral particles, positive ions (atoms or molecules that have lost one or more\nelectrons), and negative electrons.\n2B.2 What is hfg ? How do we find it?\nThe quantity hfgrepresents the specific enthalpy change between the liquid and vapor\nphases of a substance at constant temperature, and thus constant pressure, and thus\nconstant temperature. It is therefore the heat input, per unit mass, to vaporize a kilogram\nof liquid. See the notes, Section 2.B.2.\n2B.3 Reasoning behind the slopes for T=cst lines in the P-V diagram.\nThe slope of an isotherm in the gaseous phase (to the right of the vapor dome) is similar\nto the slope we found for the isotherm of an ideal gas (PV=const). Inside the vapor dome\npressure and temperature are directly related to one another (P = P(T), vapor pressure\ncurve) such that an isotherm is a horizontal line (isobar inside the vapor dome). In the\nliquid phase the isotherms are very steep lines, because for liquids the volume is about\nconstant (very low compressibility).\n2B.4 For a constant pressure heat addition, why is q=∆h?\nThe combined first and second law is dh\nTds\nvdP\n=\n+\n. For a reversible constant pressure\nprocess, dP = 0, and the heat input, dq, is TdS. Thus for a reversible constant pressure\nprocess, the answer is yes.\nFor an irreversible process we can say from the steady flow energy equation:\ndq\ndh\ndh\ncdc\nt\n=\n=\n+\n. For a steady flow, the one-dimensional momentum equation is\n\ncdc\ndP\nFviscous\n= -\n+\nρ\nρ\n,\nwhere Fviscous represents the viscous forces in an irreversible flow. Combining these two\nexpressions, and using dP = 0 (the condition of constant pressure) gives\ndq\ndh\ncdc\ndh\nFviscous\n=\n+\n=\n+\nρ\n.\nWithout going into any detail concerning the form of the viscous forces, this equation\nshows that the equality between heat input and enthalpy change does not hold for general\nirreversible flow processes at constant pressure.\n2B.5 What is latent heat?\nLatent heat is a term for the enthalpy change needed for vaporization.\n2B.6 Why is U a function of x?\nInside the vapor dome we have a mixture of liquid and vapor. The internal energy U of\nthe system (liquid and vapor) can be expressed in terms of the mass in each phase and the\nspecific internal energy u of each phase as,\nU = uf mf + ug mg.\nIntroducing the quality x as the fraction of the total mass in the vapor phase x =\nmg/(mg+mf) we can write\nU = (1 - x) uf + x ug.\nSince the specific energy of the saturated liquid and the saturated vapor are functions of\ntemperature the internal energy U of the two-phase system is a function of x and T (see\nalso notes on page 2B-6).\n2B.7 What is the reason for studying two-phase cycles?\nTheir immense practical utility in a number of industrial devices and their intrinsic\ninterest as applications of the basic principles.\n2B.8 How did you get thermal efficiency? How does a boiler work?\nThe thermal efficiency is, as previously, the net work done divided by the heat input.\nUsing the first law for a control volume we can write both of these quantities in terms of\nthe enthalpy at different states of the cycle.\nFor the steam cycles discussed in class, a boiler is a large (as in the viewgraph of the\nMitsubishi power plant) structure with a lot of tubes running through it. The water (or\nwhatever medium is used in the cycle) runs through the tubes. Hot gases wash over the\n\noutside of the tubes. The hot gases could be from a combustor or from the exit of a gas\nturbine.\n2B.9 Where does degrees Rankine come from? Related to Rankine cycles?\nI think the answer is yes, although I do not know for sure. If so, this is the same Rankine\nwho has his name on the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions across a shock wave.\n2B.10 Why do we look at the ratio of pump (compression) work to turbine work? We did\nnot do that\nfor the Brayton cycle.\nIf the ratio of compression work to turbine work were close to unity for an ideal cycle,\nsmall changes in component efficiencies would have large effects on cycle efficiency and\nwork. For the Rankine cycle this is not true. (The effect of pump efficiency on Rankine\ncycle efficiency is clearly small in the class example.) For the Brayton cycle, where the\nnet work is the difference of two numbers which are of (relatively) similar sizes, the\neffect of compressor and turbine efficiency on cycle efficiency can be much larger.\nI used the word \"sensitive\" and the meaning was that the cycle performance responded\nstrongly to changes in the compressor and turbine behavior.\n2B.11 Shouldn't the efficiency of the super/re-heated Rankine cycle be larger because its\narea is greater?\nThe area enclosed by an ideal cycle in a T-s diagram is the net work done, but it does not\ntell you about efficiency. We saw that for example when we looked at the Brayton cycle\nfor the condition of maximum work, rather than maximum efficiency (Section 1.A.4 in\nthe notes).\n2B.12 Why can't we harness the energy in the warm water after condensing the steam in\na power plant?\nLet's assume the temperature of the warm water after condensing the steam is at a\ntemperature of about 30 to 40 degrees C. If we consider running a heat engine between\nthis heat reservoir (say 35 degrees C) and the surroundings at 20 degrees C, we would get\nan ideal thermal efficiency of about 5%. In other words, the available useful work is\nrelatively small if we considered the lower heat reservoir to be the surroundings. In\ngeneral, there is a property that only depends on state variables called availability. The\nchange in availability gives the maximum work between two states, where one state is\nreferred to the surroundings (dead state)."

      "content": "Part 2.C: Introduction to Thermochemistry\n[SB&VW-14.1-14.6]\nUntil now, we have specified the heat given to the devices analyzed, and not concerned\nourselves with how this heat might be produced. In this section, we examine the issue of how we\nobtain the heat needed for work production. For the most part, this is from converting chemical\nenergy into heat, so the discussion will be on reacting mixtures of gas which are involved in\nchemical combustion processes.\nThe topic addressed is \"thermochemistry\", which is the combining of thermodynamics with\nchemistry to predict such items as how much heat is released from a chemical reaction. This is the\n\"Q\" or \"q\" that we have used in the cycle analysis. The principal components of the approach are\nuse of a chemical balance plus the steady flow energy equation (SFEE) which equates the sum of\nshaft work (from) and heat transfer (to) a control volume to the difference in control volume inlet\nand exit enthalpy fluxes.\n2.C.1 Fuels\nThere are a wide variety of fuels used for aerospace power and propulsion. A primary one\nis jet fuel (octane, essentially kerosene) which has the chemical formula C H18 . Other fuels we\nconsider are hydrogen (H2 ) and methane ( CH4 ).\nThe chemical process in which a fuel, for example methane, is burned consists of (on a very basic\nlevel--there are many intermediate reactions that need to be accounted for when computations of\nthe combustion process are carried out):\nCH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H O .\n(Reactants)\n(Products)\nThe reactions we describe are carried out in air, which can be approximated as 21% O2 and\n79% N2 . This composition is referred to as \"theoretical air\". There are other components of air\n(for example Argon, which is roughly 1%), but the results given using the theoretical air\napproximation are more than adequate for our purposes. With this definition, for each mole of O2 ,\n3.76 (79/21) moles of N2 are involved:\nCH4 + 2O2 + 2 3 76 )N → CO2 + 2H O + 7.52N2\n( .\nEven if the nitrogen is not part of the combustion process, it leaves the combustion chamber at the\nsame temperature as the other products, and this change in state (change in enthalpy) needs to be\naccounted for in the steady flow energy equation. At the high temperatures achieved in internal\ncombustion engines (aircraft and automobile) reaction does occur between the nitrogen and\noxygen, which gives rise to oxides of nitrogen, although we will not consider these reactions.\nThe condition at which the mixture of fuel and air is such that both completely participate\nin the reaction is called stoichiometric. In gas turbines, excess air is often used so that the\n2C-1\n\ntemperatures of the gas exiting the combustor is kept to within desired limits (see Figures A-8, A\n9, A-11 in Part 1 for data on these limits.)\nMuddy points\nWhy is there 3.76 N2? (MP 2C.1)\nWhat is the most effective way to solve for the number of moles in the reactions? (MP\n2C.2)\n2.C.2 Fuel-Air Ratio\nThe reaction for aeroengine fuel at stoichiometric conditions is:\nC H +12.5 O2 +12\n\n(3 76 ) N →8 CO2 + 9 H O + 47.0 N\n.\n.\n\nOn a molar basis, the ratio of fuel to air is [1/(12.5+47.0)] = 1/59.5 = 0.0167.\nTo find the ratio on a mass flow basis, which is the way in which the aeroengine industry discusses\nit, we need to \"weight\" the molar proportions by the molecular weight of the components. The\nfuel molecular weight is 114, the oxygen molecular weight is 32 and the nitrogen molecular weight\nis (approximately) 28. The fuel/air ratio on a mass flow basis is thus\n1 ×114\nFuel-air ratio =\n= 0 0664\n.\n12 5 × 32 +12 5 × 3 76 × 28\n.\n.\n.\nIf we used the actual constituents of air we would get 0.0667, a value about 0.5% different.\nMuddy points\nDo we always assume 100% complete combustion? How good an approximation is this?\n(MP 2C.3)\n2.C.3 Enthalpy of formation\nThe systems we have worked with until now have been of fixed chemical composition.\nBecause of this, we could use thermodynamic properties relative to an arbitrary base, since all\ncomparisons could be made with respect to the chosen base. For example, the specific energy\nu f ( .\no\n.\n0 01 C) = 0 0 for steam. If there are no changes in composition, and only changes in\nproperties of given substances, this is adequate. If there are changes in composition, however, we\nneed to have a reference state so there is consistency for different substances.\nThe convention used is that the reference state is a temperature of 25oC (298 K) and a pressure of\n0.1 MPa. (These are roughly room conditions.) At these reference conditions, the enthalpy of the\nelements (oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, etc.) is taken as zero.\nThe results of a combustion process can be diagrammed as below. The reactants enter at\nstandard conditions; the combustion (reaction) takes place in the volume indicated. Downstream\nof the reaction zone there is an appropriate amount of heat transfer with the surroundings so that\nthe products leave at the standard conditions.

(C.3.1) the subscripts \"R\" and \"P\" on the summations refer to the reactants (R) and products\n(P) respectively. The subscripts on the mass flow rates and enthalpies refer to all of the\ncomponents at inlet and at exit.\nThe relation in terms of mass flows can be written in molar form, which is often more convenient\nfor reacting flow problems, by using the molecular weight, Mi , to define the molar mass flow rate,\nn i , and molar enthalpy, hi , for any individual ith (or eth) component as\nn i = m i / M ; mass flow rate in terms of kmoles/sec\ni\nhi = M\n\nhi ; enthalpy per kmole\ni\nThe SFEE is, in these terms,\n\n∑n h + Q CV = ∑n he .\n(C.3.2)\ni\ni\n\ne\nR\nP\nThe statements that have been made do not necessarily need to be viewed in the context of flow\nprocesses.

(MP 2C.5)\n2C-4\n\n2.C.4 First Law Analysis of Reacting Systems\nThe form of the first law for the control volume is (there is no shaft work):\n\n∑n h + Q CV = ∑n h .\ni\ni\n\ne e\nR\nP\nThis is given in terms of the moles of the different constituents, and it reduces to the more familiar\nform for a single fluid (say air) with no reactions occurring. We need to specify one parameter as\nthe basis of the solution; 1 kmole of fuel, 1 kmole of air, 1 kmole total, etc. We use 1 kmole of\nfuel as the basic unit and examine the burning of hydrogen.\nH2 + 20 →2H O\n\nThe reactants and the products are both taken to be at 0.1MPa and 25oC, so the inlet and\nexit P and T are specified. The control volume is the combustion chamber. There is no shaft work\ndone and the SFEE is in the form of Equation (C.1.2). The enthalpy of the entering gas is zero for\nboth the hydrogen and the oxygen (elements have enthalpies defined as zero at the reference state).\nIf the exit products are in the gaseous state, the exit enthalpy is therefore related to the enthalpy of\nformation of the product by:\no\nhf\nn eH O he H O = n e\n(\n)\n2 ( )\nH O\nH O g\n= 2 x (- 241,827)kJ = - 483,654 kJ; gaseous state at exit.\nIf the water is in a liquid state at the exit of the process:\no\nhf\nn eH O he H O = n e\n(\n)\n2 ( )\nH O\nH O l\n= 2 x (- 285,783) kJ = - 571, 676.\nThere is more heat given up if the products emerge as liquid. The difference between the two\nvalues is the enthalpy needed to turn the liquid into gas at 25oC: hfg = 2442 kJ/kmole.\nA more complex example is provided by the burning of methane (natural gas) in oxygen,\nproducing .\nCH4 + 2O2 →CO2 + 2H O ( )l\nThe components in this reaction equation are three ideal gases (methane, oxygen, and CO2) and\nliquid water.

The first is the simplest and the crudest.\nCombustion processes often involve changes of a thousand degrees or more and, as Figure C-2\nshows, the specific heat for some gases can change by a factor of two or more over this range,\nalthough the changes for air are more modest. This means that, depending on the accuracy desired,\none may need to consider the temperature dependence of the specific heat in computing ∆h .\nFigure C-2: Specific heat as a function of temperature [from SB&VW]\nMuddy points\nWhen doing cycle analysis, do we have to consider combustion products and\ntheir effect on specific heat ratio (γ is not 1.4)?

Figure 5.11 p.137.\n\n2.C.5 Adiabatic Flame Temperature\nFor a combustion process that takes place adiabatically with no shaft work, the temperature\nof the products is referred to as the adiabatic flame temperature. This is the maximum temperature\nthat can be achieved for given reactants. Heat transfer, incomplete combustion, and dissociation,\nall result in lower temperature. The maximum adiabatic flame temperature for a given fuel and\noxidizer combination occurs with a stoichiometric mixture (correct proportions such that all fuel\nand all oxidizer are consumed). The amount of excess air can be tailored as part of the design to\ncontrol the adiabatic flame temperature. The considerable distance between present temperatures\nin a gas turbine engine and the maximum adiabatic flame temperature at stoichiometric conditions\nis shown in Figure A-11 of Part 1, based on a compressor exit temperature of 1200oF (922 K).\nAn initial view of the concept of adiabatic flame temperature is provided by examining two\nreacting gases, at a given pressure, and\nasking what the end temperature is. The\nprocess is shown schematically at the right,\n∆h1\nConstant P\na\nActual path\n∆h\nf = Final state\nwhere temperature is plotted versus the\npercentage completion of the reaction.\nT\n∆h2\nThe initial state is i and the final state is f,\nwith the final state at a higher\nConstant P\ntemperature than the initial state. The\nState i\nsolid line in the figure shows a\nrepresentation of the \"actual\" process.\nPercentage\n100%\nTo see how we would arrive at the final\ncompletion\nstate the dashed lines break the state\nof reaction\nchange\ninto two parts. Process (1) is reaction\nat constant T and P. To carry out such a\nprocess, we would need to extract heat.\nSuppose the total amount of heat extracted\nper unit mass is q1. The relation between\nSchematic of adiabatic flame temperature\nthe enthalpy changes in Process (1) is\nh2 -\n= -\n\nq1 = (\n)unit\nhi\nho\nf mass\nwhere q1 is the \"heat of reaction\".\nFor Process (2), we put this amount back into the products to raise their temperature to the final\nlevel. For this process, h -h2 = q1, or, if we can approximate the specific heat as constant (using\nf\nsome appropriate average value) cpav. (T -T2 ) = q1 . For the overall process there is no work done\nf\nand no heat exchanged so that the difference in enthalpy between initial and final states is zero:\n∆h1 + ∆h\n= 0.\n2 = ∆hadiabatic\nThe temperature change during this second process is therefore given by (approximately)\n2C-7\n\no\nhf\n(\n)unit\nmass\n(T -T2 ) = q\n=\n.\n(C.5.1)\nf\nc\nc\npav.\npav.\nThe value of the adiabatic flame temperature given in Equation (C.5.1) is for 100%\ncompletion of the reaction. In reality, as the temperature increases, the tendency is for the degree\nof reaction to be less than 100%. For example, for the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen, at\nhigh temperatures the combustion product (water) dissociates back into the simpler elemental\nreactants. The degree of reaction is thus itself a function of temperature that needs to be computed.\nWe used this idea in discussing the stoichiometric ramjet, when we said that the maximum\ntemperature was independent of flight Mach number and hence of inlet stagnation temperature. It\nis also to be emphasized that the idea of a constant (average) specific heat, cpav. , is for illustration\nand not inherently part of the definition of adiabatic flame temperature.\nAn example computation of adiabatic flame temperature is furnished by the combustion of liquid\noctane at 25oC with 400% theoretical air. The reaction is\nC H ( ) +12.5O +12.5 3.76N2 ) + 3 12.5O +12.5 3.76N2 )]→8CO + 9H O g\nl\n(\n[\n(\n2 ( ) + 37.5O2 +188N2 .\nFor an adiabatic process\no\no\n∑n hf + ∆h ) = ∑ne (hf + ∆h ) .\n(C.5.2)\ni (\ni\ne\nR\nP\nAt adiabatic flame temperature\nWe can again think of the general process in steps:\na) Bring reactants to 25oC [the term (∆h ) ] from the initial temperature, using whatever\ni\nheat transfer, qa , is needed.

There will be some heat transfer in this step,\nh\n\nf reactants→products\n\nqb , out of the combustor.\nc) Put back heat q + qb into the products of combustion.

From SB&VW,\npage 525, \"The assumption that air is 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen by volume leads to\nthe conclusion that for each mole of oxygen, 79/21 =3.76 moles of nitrogen are\ninvolved.\"\n2C.2 What is the most effective way to solve for the number of moles in the reactions?\nWhat we are doing is basically counting atoms on both sides of the reactantsproducts\nstatement. See Section 14.2 of SB&VW for a description of the combustion process and\nfor going from ratios in terms of moles to ratios in terms of mass.\n2C.3 Do we always assume 100% complete combustion? How good an approximation is\nthis?\nIn the problems we do, we will only consider 100% combustion. It is a good\napproximation for the range of problems that we address.\n2C.4 Is the enthalpy of formation equal to the heat transfer out of the combustion during\nthe formation reaction?\nAs defined, the enthalpy of formation relates to a process in which the initial and final\nstates are at the same temperature. If there is combustion in between, heat will have to\nbe removed for this condition to occur. The enthalpy of formation is equal to the\nnegative of the magnitude of the heat outflow. If we consider the combustion as\noccurring in a control volume, then per kmole hf\no = -Qcv , where Qcv is the heat transfer\nout of the control volume per kmole. This is not in accord with our convention, and if\nyou please feel free to transform it back into the notation we have used before. (I find\nthat if I do this there are too many minus signs to keep track of easily.)\n2C.5 Are the enthalpies of H2 and H (monoatomic hydrogen) both zero at 298K?\nThe enthalpies of the elements are taken as zero at 298 and 0.1 MPa. In some cases there\nare more than one form of the element. In that case the form chosen to have the value of\nzero is that which is chemically stable at the reference state. The other forms then have\nan enthalpy which is consistent with the reaction that produces this form of the element.\nFor hydrogen H2 has zero enthalpy at the reference conditions and H has an enthalpy of\n217,999 kJ/kmole (see Table A.8 in SB&VW), consistent with the idea that energy has to\nbe supplied to break the molecule apart.\n\n2C.6 When doing a cycle analysis, do we have to consider combustion products and their\neffect on specific heat ratio (γ is not 1.4)?\nThe specific heat ratio does depend on combustion products but the effect is not large\nbecause the fuel air ratio is small. For example, for conditions of fuel air ratio ).034, the\nspecific heat ratio at room temperature is about 1.38. A larger variation encountered in\npractice is with temperature; for a temperature of 1750K the specific heat ratio of pure air\nis 1.3.\n2C.7 Does \"adiabatic flame temperature\" assume 100% combustion?\nYes. This is the maximum temperature that could be produced. Incomplete combustion\nwill lower the temperature, as will heat transfer out of the combustion region.\n2C.8 What part of the computation for adiabatic flame temperature involves iteration?\nIf the specific heat is not a simple analytic function of temperature (i.e., suppose it is\nknown only in tabular form), we cannot get a closed form solution for the adiabatic flame\ntemperature. We can, however, readily solve the enthalpy balance (SFEE) numerically\n(this is where the iteration comes in) to find at what temperature the products have to\ncome out to have the same enthalpy (including the enthalpy of formation) as the\nreactants. We did not do this calculation yet, but we will do it to show what the iteration\nis all about.\nRemember that the assumption of constant specific heat is just that, an assumption.\nWhile this is an excellent assumption for many practical problems, if the precision of the\nanswer needed is very high, or if the range of temperatures is large (see Figure 5.11 in\nSB&VW), then we cannot assume constant specific heat."

The first is conduction, which is defined\nas transfer of heat occurring through intervening matter without bulk motion of the matter. Figure\n1.1 shows the process pictorially. A solid (a block of metal, say) has one surface at a high\ntemperature and one at a lower temperature. This type of heat conduction can occur, for example,\nthrough a turbine blade in a jet engine. The outside surface, which is exposed to gases from the\ncombustor, is at a higher temperature than the inside surface, which has cooling air next to it. The\nlevel of the wall temperature is critical for a turbine blade.\nThigh\nTlow\nSolid\nHeat \"flows\" to right ( q&)\nFigure 1.1: Conduction heat transfer\nThe second heat transfer process is convection, or heat transfer due to a flowing fluid. The\nfluid can be a gas or a liquid; both have applications in aerospace technology. In convection heat\ntransfer, the heat is moved through bulk transfer of a non-uniform temperature fluid.\nThe third process is radiation or transmission of energy through space without the necessary\npresence of matter. Radiation is the only method for heat transfer in space. Radiation can be\nimportant even in situations in which there is an intervening medium; a familiar example is the heat\ntransfer from a glowing piece of metal or from a fire.\nMuddy points\nHow do we quantify the contribution of each mode of heat transfer in a given situation?\n(MP HT.1)\n2.0\nConduction Heat Transfer\nWe will start by examining conduction heat transfer. We must first determine how to relate the\nheat transfer to other properties (either mechanical, thermal, or geometrical). The answer to this is\nrooted in experiment, but it can be motivated by considering heat flow along a \"bar\" between two\nheat reservoirs at TA, TB as shown in Figure 2.1. It is plausible that the heat transfer rate Q& , is a\n\nHT-6\nfunction of the temperature of the two reservoirs, the bar geometry and the bar properties. (Are there\nother factors that should be considered? If so, what?). This can be expressed as\nQ& = f1 (TA , TB , bar geometry, bar properties)\n(2.1)\nIt also seems reasonable to postulate that Q& should depend on the temperature difference TA - TB. If\nTA - TB is zero, then the heat transfer should also be zero. The temperature dependence can therefore\nbe expressed as\nQ& = f2 [ (TA - TB), TA, bar geometry, bar properties]\n(2.2)\nL\nTB\nTA\nQ&\nFigure 2.1: Heat transfer along a bar\nAn argument for the general form of f2 can be made from physical considerations. One\nrequirement, as said, is f2 = 0 if TA = TB. Using a MacLaurin series expansion, as follows:\nf(\nT)\nf(0)\nf\n(\nT)\nT\n∆\n∆\n∆\n=\n+\n∂\n∂\n+L\n(2.3)\nIf we define ∆T = TA - TB and f = f2, we find that (for small TA - TB),\nf (T\nT )\nQ\nf (0)\nf\n(T\nT )\nT\nT\n.\nA\nB\nA\nB\nTA TB 0\nA\nB\n-\n=\n=\n+\n∂\n∂\n-\n-\n(\n) +\n⋅\n-\n=\nL\n(2.4)\nWe know that f2(0) = 0 .

The analog of Q& is current, and the analog of the temperature difference, T1 - T2, is voltage\ndifference. From this perspective the slab is a pure resistance to heat transfer and we can define\nR\nT\nT\nQ\n1 -\n=\n&\n\n(2.19)\nwhere R = L/kA, the thermal resistance. The thermal resistance R increases as L increases, as A\ndecreases, and as k decreases.\nThe concept of a thermal resistance circuit allows ready analysis of problems such as a composite\nslab (composite planar heat transfer surface). In the composite slab shown in Figure 2.5, the heat\nflux is constant with x. The resistances are in series and sum to R = R1 + R2.

An important case is a cylindrical shell, a geometry often encountered in situations\nwhere fluids are pumped and heat is transferred. The configuration is shown in Figure 2.9.\nr1\ncontrol volume\nr1\nr2\nr2\nFigure 2.9: Cylindrical shell geometry notation\nFor a steady axisymmetric configuration, the temperature depends only on a single coordinate (r)\nand Equation (2.12b) can be written as\nk d\ndr\nA r dT\ndr\n( )\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟=\n(2.23)\nor, since A = 2π r,\nd\ndr r dT\ndr\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟=\n.\n(2.24)\nThe steady-flow energy equation (no flow, no work) tells us that\nout\nin\nQ\nQ\n&\n&\n=\nor\n=\ndr\nQ\nd &\n(2.25)\nThe heat transfer rate per unit length is given by\nQ\nk 2 r dT\ndr\n⋅\n= -⋅π\n.\n\nHT-15\nEquation (2.24) is a second order differential equation for T. Integrating this equation once gives\na\ndr\ndT\nr\n=\n.\n(2.26)\nwhere a is a constant of integration. Equation (2.26) can be written as\nr\ndr\na\ndT =\n(2.27)\nwhere both sides of equation (2.27) are exact differentials. It is useful to cast this equation in terms\nof a dimensionless normalized spatial variable so we can deal with quantities of order unity.

These will be taken to\nbe known temperatures T1 and T2 at r1 and r2 respectively. Applying T = T1 at r = r1 gives T1 = b.\nApplying T = T2 at r = r2 yields\nln\nT\nr\nr\na\nT\n+\n=\n,\nor\n(\n)\n/\nln\nr\nr\nT\nT\na\n-\n=\n.\nThe temperature distribution is thus\n(\n) (\n)\n(\n)\n/\nln\n/\nln\nT\nr\nr\nr\nr\nT\nT\nT\n+\n-\n=\n.\n(2.30)\nAs said, it is generally useful to put expressions such as (2.30) into non-dimensional and\nnormalized form so that we can deal with numbers of order unity (this also helps in checking\nwhether results are consistent). If convenient, having an answer that goes to zero at one limit is also\nuseful from the perspective of ensuring the answer makes sense.

The plane slab is thus the limiting case of the cylinder if (r -\nr1) / r << 1, where the heat transfer can be regarded as taking place in (approximately) a planar slab.\nTo see when this is appropriate, consider the expansion (\n)\nx\nx\n+\nln\n, which is the ratio of heat flux for a\ncylinder and a plane slab.\nTable 2.2: Utility of plane slab approximation\nx\n.1\n.2\n.3\n.4\n.5\n(\n)\nx\nx\n+\nln\n.95\n.91\n.87\n.84\n.81\nFor < 10% error, the ratio of thickness to inner radius should be less than 0.2, and for 20% error, the\nthickness to inner radius should be less than 0.5.\nA second example is the spherical shell with specified temperatures T (r1) = T1 and T (r2) =\nT2, as sketched in Figure 2.10.\nr1\nT2\nT1\nr2\nFigure 2.10: Spherical shell\nThe area is now\n)\n(\nr\nr\nA\nπ\n=\n, so the equation for the temperature field is\nd\ndr r dT\ndr\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟=\n.\n(2.37)\nIntegrating equation (2.37) once yields\n/ r\na\ndr\ndT =\n.\n(2.38)\nIntegrating again gives\n\nHT-18\nb\nr\na\nT\n+\n-\n=\nor, normalizing the spatial variable\n(\n) b\nr\nr\na\nT\n+\n′\n=\n/\n(2.39)\nwhere a′ and b are constants of integration.

An example is the wall\ntemperature in a turbine blade because turbine temperatures are critical as far as creep (and thus\nblade) life. A view of the problem is given in Figure 3.1, which shows a cross-sectional view of a\nturbine blade. There are three different types of cooling indicated, all meant to ensure that the metal\nis kept at a temperature much lower than that of the combustor exit flow in which the turbine blade\noperates. In this case, the turbine wall temperature is not known and must be found as part of the\nsolution to the problem.\nFigure 3.1: Turbine blade heat transfer configuration\nTo find the turbine wall temperature, we need to analyze convective heat transfer, which means we\nneed to examine some features of the fluid motion near a surface. The conditions near a surface are\nillustrated schematically in Figure 3.2.\nT\ncinf\nVelocity\ndistribution;\nc = 0 at surface\nc (velocity)\nδ′\nTw\nTinf\ny\ny\nFigure 3.2: Temperature and velocity distributions near a surface.\n\nHT-20\nIn a region of thickness δ′, there is a thin \"film\" of slowly moving fluid through which most of the\ntemperature difference occurs. Outside this layer, T is roughly uniform (this defines δ′). The heat\nflux can thus be expressed as\nq\nQ\nA\nk T\nT\nd\nw\n⋅\n⋅\ninf\n=\n=\n-\n(\n)\n′\n(3.1)\nIt cannot be emphasized enough that this is a very crude picture. The general concept, however, is\ncorrect, in that close to the wall, there is a thin layer in which heat is transferred basically by\nconduction. Outside of this region is high mixing. The difficulty is that the thickness of the layer is\nnot a fluid property. It depends on velocity (Reynolds number), structure of the wall surface,\npressure gradient and Mach number. Generally δ′ is not known and needs to be found and it is\ncustomary to calculate the heat transfer using [kfluid / δ′]. This quantity has the symbol h and is\nknown as the convective heat transfer coefficient. The units of h are W/m2K. The convective heat\ntransfer coefficient is defined by\nq\nQ\nA\nh T\nT\nw\n⋅\n⋅\ninf\n=\n=\n-\n(\n)\n(3.2)\nEquation 3.2 is often called Newton's Law of Cooling. For many situations of practical interest, the\nquantity h is still known mainly through experiments.\nMuddy points\nHow do we know that δ' is not a fluid property? (MP HT.8)\n3.1 The Reynolds Analogy\nWe describe the physical mechanism for the heat transfer coefficient in a turbulent boundary layer\nbecause most aerospace vehicle applications have turbulent boundary layers. The treatment closely\nfollows that in Eckert and Drake (1959). Very near the wall, the fluid motion is smooth and laminar,\nand molecular conduction and shear are important. The shear stress, τ, at a plane is given by\nτ\nμ\n=\ndy\ndc\n(where μ is the dynamic viscosity), and the heat flux by\ndy\ndT\nk\nq\n-\n=\n&\n. The latter is the same\nexpression that was used for a solid. The boundary layer is a region in which the velocity is lower\nthan the free stream as shown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3. In a turbulent boundary layer, the dominant\nmechanisms of shear stress and heat transfer change in nature as one moves away from the wall.\n\nHT-21\nplane\nFigure 3.3: Velocity profile near a surface\nAs one moves away from the wall (but still in the boundary layer), the flow is turbulent. The fluid\nparticles move in random directions and the transfer of momentum and energy is mainly through\ninterchange of fluid particles, shown schematically in Figure 3.4.\na\na\nm′ cp T′\nm′ cp T\nFigure 3.4: Momentum and energy exchanges in turbulent flow.\nWith reference to Figure 3.4, because of the turbulent velocity field, a fluid mass m′ penetrates the\nplane aa per unit time and unit area. In steady flow, the same amount crosses aa from the other side.\nFluid moving up transports heat m′ cp T. Fluid moving down transports m′ cp T′ downwards. If T >\nT′, there is a turbulent downwards heat flow, qt , given by q\nm c\nT\nT\nt\np\n=\n′\n′-\n(\n) that results.\nFluid moving up also has momentum m′ c and fluid moving down has momentum m′ c′. The net\nflux of momentum down per unit area and time is therefore m′ (c′ - c). This net flux of momentum\nper unit area and time is a force per unit area or stress, given by\nt\nm' c\nc\nt =\n′ -\n(\n)\n(3.3)\nBased on these considerations, the relation between heat flux and shear stress at plane aa is\n\nHT-22\nqt =\n′-\n′-\n⎛\n⎝\n⎞\n⎠\nτt p\nc\nT\nT\nc\nc\n\n(3.4)\nor (again approximately)\nqt\nt p\nc dT\ndc\n= τ\n(3.5)\nsince the locations of planes 1-1 and 2-2 are arbitrary.

For gases, Prandtl\nnumbers are in fact close to unity and for air Pr = 0.71 at room temperature. The Prandtl number\nvaries little over a wide range of temperatures; approximately 3% from 300-2000 K.\nWe want a relation between the values at the wall (at which T = Tw and c = 0) and those in the free\nstream. To get this, we integrate the expression for dT from the wall to the free stream\ndT\nc\ndc\np\n=\nq\nτ\n(3.6)\nwhere the relation between heat transfer and shear stress has been taken as the same for both the\nlaminar and the turbulent portions of the boundary layer. The assumption being made is that the\nmechanisms of heat and momentum transfer are similar.

One type of heat\nexchanger has an array of tubes with one fluid flowing inside and another fluid flowing outside, with\nthe objective of transferring heat between them.

In terms of Figure 3.6,\nT2 is the combustor exit (turbine inlet) temperature and T1 is the temperature at the compressor exit.\nWe wish to find T w2 because this is the highest metal temperature. From (3.17), the wall\ntemperature can be written as\nTw2 = T2 -\nQ\nAh2\n=\n-\n-\nT\nT\nT\nR\nAh\n(3.19)\nUsing the expression for the thermal resistance, the wall temperatures can be expressed in terms of\nheat transfer coefficients and wall properties as\n+\n+\n-\n-\n=\nk\nLh\nh\nh\nT\nT\nT\nTw\n(3.20)\nEquation (3.20) provides some basic design guidelines. The goal is to have a low value of T w2 .\nThis means h1/h2 should be large, k should be large (but we may not have much flexibility in choice\nof material) and L should be small. One way to achieve the first of these is to have h2 low (for\nexample, to flow cooling air out as in Figure 3.1 to shield the surface).\nA second example of combined conduction and convection is given by a cylinder exposed to a\nflowing fluid. The geometry is shown in Figure 3.7.\ncinf\nTinf\nr1\nr2\nr1\nFigure 3.7: Cylinder in a flowing fluid\n\nHT-28\nFor the cylinder the heat flux at the outer surface is given by\n\nq\nQ\n=\n=\n-\n(\n)\n=\ninf\nA\nh T\nT\nr\nr\nw\nat\nThe boundary condition at the inner surface could either be a heat flux condition or a temperature\nspecification; we use the latter to simplify the algebra.

(T1 - Tinf is the driving temperature distribution for the pipe). To understand the behavior of\nthe heat transfer we examine the denominator in Equation (3.23) as r2 varies. The thickness of\ninsulation that gives maximum heat transfer is given by\nd\ndr\nk\nhr\nr\nr\n+\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟=\nln\n(3.24)\n(Question: How do we know this is a maximum?)\nFrom Equation (3.24), the value of r2 for maximumQ& is thus\n(r2)maximum heat transfer = k/h.\n(3.25)\nIf r2 is less than this, we can add insulation and increase heat loss. To understand why this occurs,\nconsider Figure 3.8, which shows a schematic of the thermal resistance and the heat transfer. As r2\nincreases from a value less than r2 = k/h, two effects take place. First, the thickness of the insulation\nincreases, tending to drop the heat transfer because the temperature gradient decreases. Secondly,\nthe area of the outside surface of the insulation increases, tending to increase the heat transfer. The\nsecond of these is (loosely) associated with the k/hr2 term, the first with the ln(r2/r1) term. There are\nthus two competing effects which combine to give a maximum Q at r2 = k/h.\n\nHT-30\nR\nQ⋅\nr2\nln r\nr\nk\nhr2\nk\nh\nFigure 3.8: Critical radius of insulation\nMuddy points\nIn the expression 1\nh.A , what is A?

(MP HT.14)\n3.3 Dimensionless Numbers and Analysis of Results\nPhenomena in fluid flow and heat transfer depend on dimensionless parameters. The Mach number\nand the Reynolds number are two you have already seen. These parameters give information as to\nthe relevant flow regimes of a given solution. Casting equations in dimensionless form helps show\nthe generality of application to a broad class of situations (rather than just one set of dimensional\nparameters). It is generally good practice to use non-dimensional numbers, forms of equations, and\nresults presentation whenever possible. The results for heat transfer from the cylinder are already in\ndimensionless form but we can carry the idea even further. For the cylinder:\nT - T\nT\nT\nr/r\nk/hr\nr /r\n' <\n=\n(\n)\n+\n(\n)\nln\nln\n(3.26)\nThe parameter\nhr\nk\n2 or hL\nk\n, where L is a relevant length for the particular problem of interest, is\ncalled the Biot number denoted by Bi. In terms of this parameter,\n\nHT-31\nT - T\nT\nT\nr/r\nBi\nr /r\ninf-\n=\n(\n)\n+\n(\n)\nln\nln\n(3.27)\nThe size of the Biot number gives a key to the regimes in which different features are dominant. For\nBi >> 1 the convection heat transfer process offers little resistance to heat transfer. There is thus\nonly a small ∆T outside (i.e. T (r2) close to Tinf) compared to the ∆T through the solid with a limiting\nbehavior of\nT\nT\nT\nT\nr/r\nr /r\n-\n-\n=\ninf\nln\nln\nas Bi goes to infinity. This is much like the situation with an external temperature specified.\nFor Bi << 1 the conduction heat transfer process offers little resistance to heat transfer. The\ntemperature difference in the body (i.e. from r1 to r2) is small compared to the external temperature\ndifference, T1 - Tinf . In this situation, the limiting case is\nT\nT\nT\nT\nBi\nr/r\n-\n-\n=\n(\n)\ninf\nln\nIn this regime there is approximately uniform temperature in the cylinder. The size of the Biot\nnumber thus indicates the regimes where the different effects become important.\nFigure 3.9 shows the general effect of Biot number on temperature distribution. Figure 3.10 is a plot\nof the temperature distribution in the cylinder for values of Bi = 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0.\n\nHT-32\nFigure 3.9: Effect of the Biot Number [hL / kbody] on the temperature distributions in the solid\nand in the fluid for convective cooling of a body.

(MP HT.15)\n\nHT-36\n5.0\nHeat Transfer From a Fin\nFins are used in a large number of applications to increase the heat transfer from surfaces.\nTypically, the fin material has a high thermal conductivity. The fin is exposed to a flowing fluid,\nwhich cools or heats it, with the high thermal conductivity allowing increased heat being conducted\nfrom the wall through the fin. The design of cooling fins is encountered in many situations and we\nthus examine heat transfer in a fin as a way of defining some criteria for design.\nA model configuration is shown in Figure 5.1. The fin is of length L. The other parameters of the\nproblem are indicated. The fluid has velocity cinf and temperature Tinf.\ny\nx\nFin\nx = 0\n(wall)\nx = L\nT0 (wall)\nTinf , cinf\nFigure 5.1: Geometry of heat transfer fin\nWe assume (using the Reynolds analogy or other approach) that the heat transfer coefficient for the\nfin is known and has the value h. The end of the fin can have a different heat transfer coefficient,\nwhich we can call hL.\nThe approach taken will be quasi-one-dimensional, in that the temperature in the fin will be assumed\nto be a function of x only. This may seem a drastic simplification, and it needs some explanation.\nWith a fin cross-section equal to A and a perimeter P, the characteristic dimension in the transverse\ndirection is A / P (For a circular fin, for example, A / P = r / 2). The regime of interest will be taken\nto be that for which the Biot number is much less than unity,\n(\n)\n/\n<<\n=\nk\nP\nA\nh\nBi\n, which is a realistic\napproximation in practice.\nThe physical content of this approximation can be seen from the following. Heat transfer per unit\narea out of the fin to the fluid is roughly of magnitude ~ h(Tw - Tinf ) per unit area . The heat transfer\nper unit area within the fin in the transverse direction is (again in the same approximate terms)\n\nHT-37\nP\nA\nT\nT\nk\nw\n/\n)\n( 1 -\n, where T1 is an internal temperature. These two quantities must be of the same\nmagnitude. If\n/\n<<\nk\nP\nA\nh\n, then T\nT\nT\nT\nw\nw\n-\n-\n<<\ninf\n. In other words, if Bi << 1, there is a much larger\ncapability for heat transfer per unit area across the fin than there is between the fin and the fluid, and\nthus little variation in temperature inside the fin in the transverse direction. To emphasize the point,\nconsider the limiting case of zero heat transfer to the fluid i.e., an insulated fin. Under these\nconditions, the temperature within the fin would be uniform and equal to the wall temperature.\nIf there is little variation in temperature across the fin, an appropriate model is to say that the\ntemperature within the fin is a function of x only, T = T(x), and use a quasi-one-dimensional\napproach. To do this, consider an element, dx, of the fin as shown in Figure 5.2. There is heat flow\nof magnitude\nin\nQ& at the left-hand side and heat flow out of magnitude\ndx\ndx\nQ\nd\nQ\nQ\nin\nout\n&\n&\n&\n+\n=\nat the\nright hand side. There is also heat transfer around the perimeter on the top, bottom, and sides of the\nfin. From a quasi-one-dimensional point of view, this is a situation similar to that with internal heat\nsources, but here, for a cooling fin, in each elemental slice of thickness dx there is essentially a heat\nsink of magnitude Pdxh T\nT\n-inf\n(\n), where Pdx is the area for heat transfer to the fluid.\nin\nQ&\nx x+dx\nout\nQ&\nFigure 5.2:Element of fin showing heat transfer\nThe heat balance for the element in Figure 5.2 can be written in terms of the heat flux using\nA\nq\nQ\n&\n& =\n,\nfor a fin of constant area:\n\nq\nq\nq\nA\nPh T\nT\ndx\nA\nd\ndx dxA\n=\n-\n(\n)\n+\n+\n⎛\n⎝\n⎞\n⎠\ninf\n.\n(5.1)\nFrom Equation (5.1) we obtain\nAd\ndx\nPh T\nT\nq +\n-\n(\n) =\ninf\n.\n(5.2)\nIn terms of the temperature distribution, T(x):\nd T\ndx\nPh\nAk T\nT\n2 -\n-\n(\n) =\ninf\n.\n(5.3)\n\nHT-38\nThe quantity of interest is the temperature difference (T - Tinf ), and we can change variables to put\nEquation (5.3) in terms of this quantity using the substitution\nd\ndx (T\nT )\ndT\ndx\n-\n=\ninf\n.\n(5.4)\nEquation (5.3) can therefore be written as\nd\ndx\n(T\nT )\nhP\nAk (T\nT )\n-\n-\n-\n=\ninf\ninf\n.\n(5.5)\nEquation (5.5) describes the temperature variation along the fin.

In the present case, developing the analytic\nsolution is useful in presenting the structure of the solution as well as the numbers, so we resort to the mild fiction\nof no heat transfer at the fin end.

An example is the heating\nup of gas turbine compressors as they are brought up to speed during take-off. The disks that hold\nthe blades are large and take a long time to come to temperature, while the casing is thin and in the\npath of high velocity compressor flow and thus comes to temperature rapidly. The result is that the\ncase expands away from the blade tips, sometimes enough to cause serious difficulties with\naerodynamic performance.\nTo introduce the topic as well as to increase familiarity with modeling of heat transfer problems, we\nexamine a lumped parameter analysis of an object cooled by a stream. This will allow us to see\nwhat the relevant non-dimensional parameters are and, at least in a quantitative fashion, how more\ncomplex heat transfer objects will behave. We want to view the object as a \"lump\" described by a\nsingle parameter. We need to determine when this type of analysis would be appropriate.

We can thus say T\nT\nT\nT\nw\nw\n-\n(\n) <<\n-\ninf and neglect the temperature non-uniformity\nwithin the object.\n\nHT-43\nThe approximation made is to view the object as having a spatially uniform temperature that is a\nfunction of time only. Explicitly, T = T(t). The first law applied to the object is (using the fact that\nfor solids cp = cv = c)\nQ\nVc dT\ndt\nin\n⋅\n= ρ\n(6.3)\nwhere ρ is the density of the object and V is its volume. In terms of heat transferred to the fluid,\ndt\ndT\nVc\nQout\nρ\n-\n=\n&\n. The rate of heat transfer to the fluid is Ah (T - Tinf), so the expression for the time\nevolution of the temperature is\nAh T\nT\nVc dT\ndt\n-\n(\n) = -\ninf\nρ\n.\n(6.4)\nThe initial temperature, T(0), is equal to some known value, which we can call Ti . Using this,\nEquation (6.4) can be written in terms of a non-dimensional temperature difference T\nT\nT\nT\ni\n-\n-\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟\ninf\ninf\n,\nd\ndt\nT\nT\nT\nT\nhA\nVc\nT\nT\nT\nT\ni\ni\n-\n-\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟+\n-\n-\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟=\ninf\ninf\ninf\ninf\nρ\n(6.5)\nAt time t = 0, this non-dimensional quantity is equal to one. Equation (6.5) is an equation you have\nseen before, dx\ndt\nx\n+\n=\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟\nτ\nwhich has the solution x\nae t\n=\n-/ τ .

This form of equation\nimplies that the solution has a heat transfer \"time constant\" given by\nhA\nVc\nρ\nτ =\n.\nThe time constant,τ, is in accord with our \"intuition\"; high density, large volume, or high specific\nheat all tend to increase the time constant, while high heat transfer coefficient and large area will\ntend to decrease the time constant. This is the same form of equation and the same behavior you\nhave seen for the R-C circuit, as shown schematically below. The time dependence of the voltage in\nthe R-C circuit when the switch is opened suddenly is given by the equation\n=\n+ RC\nE\ndt\ndE\n. There\nare, in fact, a number of physical processes which have (or can be modeled as having) this type of\nexponentially decaying behavior.\n\nHT-44\nE0\nC\nR\nFigure 6.2: Voltage change in an R-C circuit\nMuddy points\nIn equation Q\n.V.c. dT\ndt\nin\n-\n= ρ\n(6.3), what is c?

(MP HT.20)\n7.0\nSome Considerations in Modeling Complex Physical Processes\nIn Sections 5 and 6, a number of assumptions were made about the processes that we were\nattempting to describe. These are all part of the general approach to modeling of physical systems.\nThe main idea is that for engineering systems, one almost always cannot compute the process\nexactly, especially for fluid flow problems. At some level of detail, one generally needs to model,\ni.e. to define some plausible behavior for attributes of the system that will not be computed.\nModeling can span an enormous range from the level of our assumption of uniform temperature\nwithin the solid object to a complex model for the small scale turbulent eddies in the flow past a\ncompressor blade. In carrying out such modeling, it is critical to have a clear idea of just what the\nassumptions really mean, as well as the fidelity that we ascribe to the descriptions of actual physical\nphenomena, and we thus look at the statements we have made in this context.\nOne assertion made was that because hL\nk\n<< 1 and on the basis of a heat balance,\nk\nL T\nT\nh T\nT\nc\nw\nW\n-\n(\n) ≈\n-\n(\n)\ninf\nwe could assume\n(T\nT )\n(T\nT )\nw\nw\nbody interior -\n-\n<<\ninf\n\nHT-45\nBased on this, we said that Tbody is approximately uniform and T\nT\nw ≈\nbody interior. Another aspect is\nthat setting\n<<\nPk\nhA\nerases any geometrical detail of the fin cross section. The only place where P\nand A enter the problem is in a non-dimensional combination. A third assumption, made in the fin\nproblem, was that the heat transfer at the far end can be neglected. The solution including this\neffect, where\nh L\nk\nL\nis an axial Biot number is given as Equation (7.1). If the quantity\nh L\nk\nL\nis small,\nyou can see that Equation (7.1) reduces to the previous result (5.13).\nT\nT\nT\nT\nmL\nBi\nm\nmL\nmL\nBi\nmL\nmL\n-\n-\n=\n-\n(\n) +(\n)\n-\n(\n)\n+(\n)\ninf\ninf\ncosh\nsinh\ncosh\nsinh\nξ\nξ\naxial\naxal\n/\n/\n(7.1)\nand\nQ\nkAhP T\nT\nBi\n/mL\nmL\nBi\nmL\nmL\naxial\naxial\n⋅\ninf\n-\n(\n)\n= (\n) +\n+\ntanh\ntanh\n(7.2)\n8.0\nHeat Exchangers\nThe general function of a heat exchanger is to transfer heat from one fluid to another. The basic\ncomponent of a heat exchanger can be viewed as a tube with one fluid running through it and\nanother fluid flowing by on the outside. There are thus three heat transfer operations that need to be\ndescribed:\n1) Convective heat transfer from fluid to the inner wall of the tube\n2) Conductive heat transfer through the tube wall\n3) Convective heat transfer from the outer tube wall to the outside fluid\nHeat exchangers are typically classified according to flow arrangement and type of construction.\nThe simplest heat exchanger is one for which the hot and cold fluids move in the same or opposite\ndirections in a concentric tube (or double-pipe) construction. In the parallel-flow arrangement of\nFigure 8.1a, the hot and cold fluids enter at the same end, flow in the same direction, and leave at the\nsame end. In the counterflow arrangement of Figure 8.1b, the fluids enter at opposite ends, flow in\nopposite directions, and leave at opposite ends.\nAlternatively, the fluids may be in cross flow (perpendicular to each other), as shown by the\nfinned and unfinned tubular heat exchangers of Figure 8.2. The two configurations differ according\nto whether the fluid moving over the tubes is unmixed or mixed. In Figure 8.2a, the fluid is said to\nbe unmixed because the fins prevent motion in a direction (y) that is transverse to the main-flow\ndirection (x). In this case the fluid temperature varies with x and y. In contrast, for the unfinned tube\nbundle of Figure 8.2b, fluid motion, hence mixing, in the transverse direction is possible, and\ntemperature variations are primarily in the main-flow direction. Since the tube flow is unmixed,\n\nHT-46\nboth fluids are unmixed in the finned exchanger, while one fluid is mixed and the other unmixed in\nthe unfinned exchanger.\n\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 8.1: Concentric tubes heat exchangers.

When radiated photons reach another surface, they may either be absorbed, reflected\nor transmitted. The behavior of a surface with radiation incident upon it can be described by the\nfollowing quantities:\nα = absorptance - fraction of incident radiation absorbed\nρ = reflectance - fraction of incident radiation reflected\nτ = transmittance - fraction of incident radiation transmitted\nFigure 9.1 shows these processes graphically.\nIncident radiation\nRadiation absorbed, α\nRadiation transmitted, τ\nRadiation reflected, ρ\nFigure 9.1: Radiation Surface Properties\nFrom energy considerations the three coefficients must sum to unity\nα + ρ + τ = 1\n(9.1)\nReflective energy may be either diffuse or specular (mirror-like). Diffuse reflections are\nindependent of the incident radiation angle. For specular reflections, the reflection angle equals the\nangle of incidence.\n9.1 Ideal Radiators\nAn ideal thermal radiator is called a \"black body\". It has several properties:\n1) It has α = 1, and absorbs all radiation incident on it.\n2) The energy radiated per unit area is Eb = σT4 where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,\nσ = 5.67 x 10-8\nW\nm K\n(9.2)\n\nHT-55\nThe units of Eb are therefore W\nm\n2 .\nThe energy of a black body, E b, is distributed over a range of wavelengths of radiation. We can\ndefine e\ndE\nd\nE\nb\nb\nλ\nλ\nλ\n=\n≈∆\n∆\n, the energy radiated per unit area for a range of wavelengths of width ∆λ .\nThe behavior of eλ is given in Figure 9.2.\nFigure 9.2: Emissive power of a black body at several temperatures - predicted and observed\n(\n)\nmax\nλ\nλ\ne\nT\n= 0.2898 cm K [adapted from: A Heat Transfer Textbook by Lienhard, J.]\nThe distribution of eλ varies with temperature. The quantity λT at the condition where eλ is a\nmaximum is given by (\n)\nmax\nλ\nλ\ne\nT\n= 0.2898 cm K. As T increases, the wavelength for maximum energy\nemission shifts to shorter values. The frequency of the radiation, f, is given by f = c/λ so high energy\nmeans short wavelengths and high frequency.\nMonochromatic emissive power, eλ kW/m -micron\n\nHT-56\nFigure 9.3: A cavity with a small hole (approximates a black body)\nA physical realization of a black body is a cavity with a small hole. There are many reflections and\nabsorptions. Very few entering photons (light rays) will get out. The inside of the cavity has\nradiation which is homogeneous and isotropic (the same in any direction, uniform everywhere).\nSuppose we put a small black body inside the cavity as seen in Figure 9.4. The cavity and the black\nbody are both at the same temperature.\nBlack body\nTemperature T\nCavity\nFigure 9.4: A small black body inside a cavity\nThe radiant energy absorbed by the black body per second and per m2 is αΒH, where H is the\nirradiance, the radiant energy falling on any surface inside the cavity. The radiant energy emitted by\nthe black body is EB. Since αB = 1 for a black body, H = EB. The irradiance within a cavity whose\nwalls are at temperature T is therefore equal to the radiant emittance of a black body at the same\ntemperature and irradiance is a function of temperature only.\n9.2 Kirchhoff's Law and \"Real Bodies\"\nReal bodies radiate less effectively than black bodies. The measurement of this is the emittance, ε ,\ndefined by\n\nHT-57\nEmittance: ε = E\nEb\nValues of emittance vary greatly for different materials. They are near unity for rough surfaces such\nas ceramics or oxidized metals, and roughly 0.02 for polished metals or silvered reflectors. A table\nof emittances for different substances is given at the end of this section as Table 9.1, taken from the\nbook by Lienhard.\nThe level of the emittance can be related to the absorptance using the following arguments. Suppose\nwe have a small non-black body in the cavity. The power absorbed per unit area is equal to αH.\nThe power emitted is equal to E. An energy balance gives E = Ebε = α H =α Eb.. Thus\nε\nα =\n=\nb\nE\nE\n(9.3)\nEquation (9.3), the relation α = ε , is known as Kirchhoff's Law. It implies that good radiators are\ngood absorbers. It was derived for the case when Tbody = Tsurroundings (cavity) and is not strictly true\nfor all circumstances when the temperature of the body and the cavity are different, but it is true if αλ\n= α ,ελ = ε, so the absorptance and emittance are not functions of λ . This situation describes a\n\"gray body\". Also, since αλ , ελ are properties of the surface, αλ = ελ .\n9.3 Radiation Heat Transfer Between Planar Surfaces\nE1\nρ2\nE\nρ ρ\n1 2\nE\nρ ρ\nE\nα2\nE\nα ρ\n1 2\nE\nρ ρ α\n1 2\n2E1\nρ ρ\nE\nρ ρ α\n1 2\nE\nSurface 1\nSurface 2\nFigure 9.5: Path of a photon between two gray surfaces\nConsider the two infinite gray surfaces shown in Figure 9.5.

F., Heat Transfer, Irwin, 1992.\n\nMuddiest points on heat transfer\nHT.1 How do we quantify the contribution of each mode of heat transfer in a given\nsituation?\nDeveloping the insight necessary to address the important parts of a complex situation\n(such as turbine heat transfer) and downplay (neglect or treat approximately) the other\naspects is part of having a solid working knowledge of the fundamentals. This is an\nimportant issue, because otherwise every problem will seem very complex. One way to\nsort out what is important is to make order of magnitude estimates (similar to what we\ndid to answer when the one-dimensional heat transfer approximation was appropriate) to\nsee whether all three modes have to be considered. Sometimes one can rule out one or\ntwo modes on the basis of the problem statement. For example if there were a vacuum\nbetween the two surfaces in the thermos bottle, we would not have to consider\nconvection, but often the situation is more subtle.\nHT.2 How specific do we need to be about when the one-dimensional assumption is\nvalid? Is it enough to say that dA/dx is small?\nThe answer really is \"be specific enough to enable one to have faith in the analysis or at\nleast some idea of how good the answer is\". This is a challenge that comes up a great\ndeal. For now, if we say that A is an area defined per unit depth normal to the\nblackboard then saying dA/dx is small, which is a statement involving a non-dimensional\nparameter, is a reasonable criterion.\nHT.3 Why is the thermal conductivity of light gases such as helium (monoatomic) or\nhydrogen (diatomic) much higher than heavier gases such as argon (monoatomic)\nor nitrogen (diatomic)?\nTo answer this, we need some basics of the kinetic theory of gases. A reference for this\nis Castellan, Physical Chemistry, Benjamin/Cummings Publishers, 1986. Two factor\ncontribute, the collision cross section and the average molecular velocity. For the gases\nmentioned above the dominant factor appears to be the velocity. The kinetic energy per\nmolecule at a given temperature is the same and so the lower the molecular weight the\nhigher the average molecular velocity.\nHT.4 What do you mean by continuous?\nThe meaning is similar to the definition you have seen in the math subjects. A way to\nstate it is that the function at a given location has the same value as we approach the\nlocation independent of the direction we approach from. To say this in a more physical\nmanner, the temperature as a function of x has the same value at x = a, say, whether we\napproach location a from the left or from the right. In terms of what the function looks\nlike, it will have no \"jumps\" or discontinuous (step) changes in value.\n\nHT.5 Why is temperature continuous in the composite wall problem? Why is it continuous\nat the interface between two materials?\nWe can argue this point by supposing T were not continuous, i.e., there was a different\ntemperature on the two sides of an interface between two materials, with the interface\ntruly a sharp plane. If so, there would be a finite temperature difference across an\ninfinitesimal distance, leading to a very large (infinite in the limit) heat flux which would\nimmediately erase the temperature difference. This argument could also be applied to\nany location inside a solid of uniform composition, guaranteeing that the temperature is\ncontinuous in each material.\nHT.6 Why is the temperature gradient dT/dx not continuous?\nAs derived in class, across an interface the heat flux is continuous. From the first law, for\na thin control volume that encloses the interface the net heat flow into the control volume\nis zero. As sketched below, the contribution from the heat flux at the upper and lower\nends of the control volume is negligible so the heat flux in one side must be the same as\nthe flux out of the other. The heat flux, however, is related to the temperature gradient by\nrq\nk T\n= -∇, or, for one-dimension, q\nk dT\ndx\nx = -⎛\n⎝\n⎞\n⎠. If the heat flux is continuous, and if\nthe thermal conductivity, k, is not the same in the two materials, then dT/dx is not\ncontinuous.\nMaterial\nA\nMaterial\nB\nInterface\nControl volume\nqin\nqout\nHT.7 Why is ∆T the same for the two elements in a parallel thermal circuit? Doesn't the\nrelative area of the bolt to the wood matter?\nIn terms of the bolt through the wood wall, the approximation made is that the bolt and\nthe wood are both exposed to the same conditions at the two sides of the wall. The\nrelative areas of the bolt and the wood indeed do matter. Suppose we consider a square\nmeter area of wood without bolts. It has a certain heat resistance. If we now add bolts to\n\nthe wall, the resistance of each bolt is R\nL\nk\nA\nbolt\nbolt\nbolt\nbolt\n=\n. If there are n bolts, they will be\nin parallel, and the effective area will be n times the area for one bolt. The thermal\nresistance of the wood will be increased by a factor of A\nA\nwithout\nbolts\nwith\nn bolts\n/\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟, which is larger\nthan unity.\nIn summary, the amount by which the heat transfer is increased depends on the fractional\narea with low thermal resistance compared to the fractional area with high thermal\nresistance.\nHT.8 How do we know that δ' is not a fluid property?\nThe term\n′\n⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎞\n⎠⎟\nδ\nk\nrepresents the resistance to heat transfer for a unit area. The resistance to\nheat transfer per unit area (1/heat transfer coefficient) can be computed for cases of\nlaminar flow, or measured experimentally where we cannot compute it, and it is found\nthat for the same state variables, it can have a range of values of several orders of\nmagnitude depending on the parameters I described (Reynolds number, surface condition,\nsurface shape...). Put another way, if the value of the resistance is affected by the surface\ncondition (smooth, bumpy, corrugated, etc.) how can the resistance be just a property of\nthe fluid?\nHT.9 What is the \"analogy\" that we are discussing? Is it that the equations are similar?\nWhile the equations are similar, the concepts are deeper than that. The analogy is drawn\nbetween the heat transfer process (transfer of heat represented by heat flux) and the\nmomentum transfer process (transfer of momentum represented by shear stress)\nHT.10 In what situations does the Reynolds analogy \"not work\"?\nThe Reynolds Analogy is just that. It is not a law of nature, but rather a plausible\nhypothesis that allows useful estimation of the heat transfer coefficients in many\nsituations in which little or no explicit heat transfer information exists. In the form we\nhave derived it, the Reynolds Analogy is appropriate for use in air, but it is not strictly\napplicable if there are pressure gradients, or if the Prandtl number ( Pr = μc\nk\np ) is not\nunity. However, the conceptual framework provided by the analogy has been found\nuseful enough that the analogy has been extended (in a more complex form, as briefly\ndiscussed in class) for application to these situations.\n\nHT.11 In the expression 1\nh.A , what is A?\nA is the area normal to the heat flow. For a turbine blade, for example, it would be the\nouter surface area of the blade.\nHT.12 It seems that we have simplified convection a lot. Is finding the heat transfer\ncoefficient, h, really difficult?\nWe have indeed \"simplified convection a lot\". We will look at heat transfer by\nconvection in more depth in a few lectures, but to answer the question in a few sentences,\nfinding the heat transfer coefficient is a difficult problem, because it necessitates\ndetermining the fluid dynamics; the latter is key to predictions of heat transfer. Even\nwith present computational power, calculating the flow around aerospace devices with\nthe accuracy needed to be confident about heat transfer coefficients is not by any means a\n\"standard\" calculation. For some circumstances, it is still beyond the state of the art. We\nwill concentrate on describing (i) the basic mechanisms of convective heat transfer and\n(ii) ways of estimating the heat transfer coefficient from known fluid dynamic\ninformation.\nHT.13 What does the \"K\" in the contact resistance formula stand for?\nThe definition of the resistance comes out of\nthermal\ndriving\nR\nT\nQ\n∆\n=\n&\n. The units of Q& are\nWatts/meter2, so the units of Rthermal are [degrees x meters2/Watts]. The K is thus the\nsymbol for Kelvin, or degree centigrade.\nHT.14 In the equation for the temperature in a cylinder (3.22), what is \"r\"?\nThe variable r denotes the radial coordinate, in other words the location of the point at\nwhich we want to know the temperature.\nHT.15 For an electric heated strip embedded between two layers, what would the\ntemperature distribution be if the two side temperatures were not equal?\nIf the two temperatures on the outer surfaces of the composite layer were T\nT\nand\n, the\nheat flux from the two sides of the electrical heater would be different, but the sum of the\ntwo heat fluxes would still be equal to the heat generated per unit area and unit time. In\nfact heat could be coming into one side of the heater if one of the temperatures were high\nenough. (Sketch this out and prove it to yourself.) The temperature distribution would\nbe linear from the heater temperature to the two surface temperatures. If this example is\nnot clear, please come and see me.\n\nHT.16 Why did you change the variable and write the derivative d T\ndx\n2 as d\nT - T\ndx\ninf\n(\n) in\nthe equation for heat transfer in the fin?\nThe heat balance and derivation of the equation for temperature (5.3) is given in Section\n5.0 of the notes. This is\nd T\ndx\nPh\nAk T\nT\n-\n-\n(\n) =\ninf\n(5.3)\nIt is not necessary to change variables, and one could solve (5.3) as is\n(or in the form d T\ndx\nPh\nAk T\nT\n-\n=\ninf). However, since: (1) the reference temperature is Tinf,\nand what is of interest is the difference T\nT\n-\ninf, (2) making the substitution results in a\nsimpler form of the equation to be solved, and (3) the derivative of T\nT\n-\ninf is the same as\nthe derivative of T, I found it convenient to put it the equation in the form of Eq. (5.5),\nd\nT\nT\ndx\nPh\nAk T\nT\n-\n(\n) -\n-\n(\n) =\ninf\ninf\n.\n(5.5)\nHT.17 What types of devices use heat transfer fins?\nA number of types of heat exchangers use fins. Examples of the use of fins you may\nhave seen are cooling fins on motorcycle engine heads, cooling fins on electric power\ntransformers, or cooling fins on air conditioners.\nHT.18 Why did the Stegosaurus have cooling fins? Could the stegosaurus have \"heating\nfins\"?\nMy knowledge of this issue extends only to reading about it in the text by Lienhard (see\nreference in notes). The journal article referenced in that text is:\nFarlow, J. O., Thompson, C. V., and Rosner, D.E., \"Plates of the Dinosaur Stegosaurus:\nForced Convection Heat Loss Fins?, Science, vol. 192, no. 4244, 1976, pp. 1123-1125\nand cover.\nHT.19 In equation Q\n.V.c. dT\ndt\nin\n-\n= ρ\n(6.3), what is c?\nc is the specific heat for a unit mass. We don't have to differentiate between the two\nspecific heats for a solid because the volume changes are very small, unlike a gas.\nHT.20 In the lumped parameter transient heat transfer problem, does a high density\n\"slow down\" heat transfer?\nIt doesn't. The high density slows down the rate at which the object changes\ntemperature; high density means more \"heat capacity\".\n\nHT.21 Which bodies does the radiation heat transfer occur between in the thermocouple?\nThe radiation heat transfer was between the walls (or more generally the boundaries of\nthe duct) and the thermocouple. The boundaries may not be at the same temperature of\nthe flowing fluid, for example in a turbine. If the boundaries are not at the same\ntemperature as the fluid, and they radiate to the thermocouple, there can be an error in the\ntemperature that the thermocouple reads. The discussion was about different possible\nsources of this type of error.\nHT.22 Still muddy about thermocouples.\nI didn't mean to strew confusion about these. As on page 59 of the notes, if we take a\npair of dissimilar wires (say copper and constantan (an alloy of tin and several other\nmetals) or platinum and rhodium) which are joined at both ends and subject the two\njunctions to a temperature difference, it is found that a voltage difference will be created.\nIf we know the temperature of one junction (say by use of an ice bath) and we know the\nrelation between voltage and temperature difference (these have been measured in detail)\nwe can find the temperature of the other junction from measurement of the voltage. The\nassumption is that the temperature of the junction is the temperature that is of interest; the\npossible error in this thinking is the subject of muddy point 1.\nHT.23 Why does increasing the local flow velocity decrease the temperature error for the\nthermocouple?\nThe heat transferred by convection is\n(\n)\nfluid\nle\nthermocoup\nconvection\nT\nT\nh\nQ\n-\n=\n&\n. If we neglect\nconduction from the wire junction (in other words assume the thermocouple wires are\nthin and long), the heat balance is between convection heat transfer and radiation heat\ntransfer. For a fixed\nconvection\nQ&\nif the heat transfer increases the temperature difference\nbetween the thermocouple and the fluid decreases. We have seen, however, that the heat\ntransfer may be estimated using the Reynolds analogy (Section 3.1). For fixed skin\nfriction coefficient the higher the velocity the higher the heat transfer coefficient."

A heat transfer analysis was conducted and\nthe heat transfer per compressor blade is given by\n\ntanh\n(\n)\nP h\nQ\nAPhk\nL\nT\nT\nA k\ninf\n\n=\n\n&\n⋅\n-\n\n[W / blade].\n\nThe compressor blade cross-sectional area A is 3e-7 m2, the blade perimeter P is 6\nmm and the blade span L is 400 mm. The average gas path temperature in the\ncompressor\nis 600 K. Silicon has a thermal conductivity k of 60 W/mK. You can\nassume an air density of 3.5 kg/m3 and a specific heat of c\nTinf\np = 1 KJ/kgK. The average\nvelocity through the compressor is 250 m/s and the average skin friction coefficient\ncf is 0.008.\n\nPage 2 of 3\n\nPage 3 of 3\nHow many compressor blades do you need to make sure that the rotor does not\nmelt?"
