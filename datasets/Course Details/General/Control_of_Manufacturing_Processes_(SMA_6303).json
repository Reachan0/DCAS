Boning.\n\nANOVA - Fixed effects model\n- The ANOVA approach assumes a simple mathematical\nmodel:\n- Where μt is the treatment mean (for treatment type t)\n- And τt is the treatment effect\n- With εti being zero mean normal residuals ~N(0,σ0\n2)\nμ\nτt\nεti\nCopyright 2003-2007 (c) Duane S.

Boning.\n\n(2) Between Group Variation\n- We will be testing hypothesis μ1 = μ2 = ... = μk\n- If all the means are in fact equal, then a 2nd estimate\nof σ2 could be formed based on the observed\ndifferences between group means:\n- If the treatments in fact have different means, then\nsT\n2 estimates something larger:\nVariance is \"inflated\" by the\nreal treatment effects τt\nVariance is \"inflated\" by the\nreal treatment effects τt\nSample A\nSample B\nSample C\nPopulation A\nPopulation B\nPopulation C\nCopyright 2003-2007 (c) Duane S. Boning.\n\n(3) Compare Variance Estimates\n- We now have two different possibilities for sT\n2,\ndepending on whether the observed sample mean\ndifferences are \"real\" or are just occurring by chance\n(by sampling)\n- Use F statistic to see if the ratios of these variances\nare likely to have occurred by chance!\n- Formal test for significance:\nCopyright 2003-2007 (c) Duane S. Boning.\n\n(4) Compute Significance Level\n- Calculate observed F ratio (with appropriate\ndegrees of freedom in numerator and\ndenominator)\n- Use F distribution to find how likely a ratio this\nlarge is to have occurred by chance alone\n- This is our \"significance level\"\n- Define observed ratio:\n- If\nthen we say that the mean differences or treatment\neffects are significant to (1-α)100% confidence or\nbetter\nCopyright 2003-2007 (c) Duane S.

INTRODUCTION\nHIS document is a template for Microsoft Word versions\n6.0 or later. If you are reading a paper version of this\ndocument, please download the electronic file, TRANS-\nJOUR.DOC,\nfrom\nhttp://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/stylesheet\ns.htm so you can use it to prepare your manuscript. If you\nwould prefer to use LATEX, download IEEE's LATEX style\nand sample files from the same Web page. Use these LATEX\nfiles for formatting, but please follow the instructions in\nTRANS-JOUR.DOC or TRANS-JOUR.PDF.\nIf your paper is intended for a conference, please contact\nyour conference editor concerning acceptable word processor\nformats for your particular conference.\n\nManuscript received October 9, 2001. (Write the date on which you\nsubmitted your paper for review.) This work was supported in part by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce under Grant BS123456 (sponsor and financial\nsupport acknowledgment goes here). Paper titles should be written in\nuppercase and lowercase letters, not all uppercase. Avoid writing long\nformulas with subscripts in the title; short formulas that identify the elements\nare fine (e.g., \"Nd-Fe-B\"). Do not write \"(Invited)\" in the title. Full names of\nauthors are preferred in the author field, but are not required. Put a space\nbetween authors' initials.\nF. A. Author is with the National Institute of Standards and Technology,\nBoulder, CO 80305 USA (corresponding author to provide phone: 303-555-\n5555; fax: 303-555-5555; e-mail: author@ boulder.nist.gov).\nS. B. Author, Jr., was with Rice University, Houston, TX 77005 USA. He\nis now with the Department of Physics, Colorado State University, Fort\nCollins, CO 80523 USA (e-mail: author@lamar. colostate.edu).\nT. C. Author is with the Electrical Engineering Department, University of\nColorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA, on leave from the National Research\nInstitute for Metals, Tsukuba, Japan (e-mail: author@nrim.go.jp).\nWhen you open TRANS-JOUR.DOC, select \"Page Layout\"\nfrom the \"View\" menu in the menu bar (View | Page Layout),\nwhich allows you to see the footnotes. Then type over sections\nof TRANS-JOUR.DOC or cut and paste from another\ndocument and then use markup styles. The pull-down style\nmenu is at the left of the Formatting Toolbar at the top of your\nWord window (for example, the style at this point in the\ndocument is \"Text\"). Highlight a section that you want to\ndesignate with a certain style, then select the appropriate name\non the style menu. The style will adjust your fonts and line\nspacing. Do not change the font sizes or line spacing to\nsqueeze more text into a limited number of pages. Use\nitalics for emphasis; do not underline.\nTo insert images in Word, position the cursor at the\ninsertion point and either use Insert | Picture | From File or\ncopy the image to the Windows clipboard and then Edit | Paste\nSpecial | Picture (with \"Float over text\" unchecked).\nIEEE will do the final formatting of your paper. If your\npaper is intended for a conference, please observe the\nconference page limits.\n\nII. PROCEDURE FOR PAPER SUBMISSION\nA. Review Stage\nPlease check with your editor on whether to submit your\nmanuscript by hard copy or electronically for review. If hard\ncopy, submit photocopies such that only one column appears\nper page. This will give your referees plenty of room to write\ncomments. Send the number of copies specified by your editor\n(typically four). If submitted electronically, find out if your\neditor prefers submissions on disk or as e-mail attachments.\nIf you want to submit your file with one column\nelectronically, please do the following:\n--First, click on the View menu and choose Print Layout.\n--Second, place your cursor in the first paragraph. Go to\nthe Format menu, choose Columns, choose one column\nLayout, and choose \"apply to whole document\" from the\ndropdown menu.\n--Third, click and drag the right margin bar to just over 4\ninches in width.\nThe graphics will stay in the \"second\" column, but you can\ndrag them to the first column. Make the graphic wider to push\nout any text that may try to fill in next to the graphic.\nT\n\nB. Final Stage\nWhen you submit your final version, after your paper has\nbeen accepted, print it in two-column format, including\nfigures and tables. Send three prints of the paper; two will go\nto IEEE and one will be retained by the Editor-in-Chief or\nconference publications chair.\nYou must also send your final manuscript on a disk, which\nIEEE will use to prepare your paper for publication. Write the\nauthors' names on the disk label. If you are using a\nMacintosh, please save your file on a PC formatted disk, if\npossible. You may use Zip or CD-ROM disks for large files,\nor compress files using Compress, Pkzip, Stuffit, or Gzip.\nAlso send a sheet of paper with complete contact\ninformation for all authors. Include full mailing addresses,\ntelephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses. This\ninformation will be used to send each author a complimentary\ncopy of the journal in which the paper appears. In addition,\ndesignate one author as the \"corresponding author.\" This is\nthe author to whom proofs of the paper will be sent. Proofs are\nsent to the corresponding author only.\nC. Figures\nAll tables and figures will be processed as images.\nHowever, IEEE cannot extract the tables and figures\nembedded in your document. (The figures and tables you\ninsert in your document are only to help you gauge the size of\nyour paper, for the convenience of the referees, and to make it\neasy for you to distribute preprints.) Therefore, submit, on\nseparate sheets of paper, enlarged versions of the tables\nand figures that appear in your document. These are the\nimages IEEE will scan and publish with your paper.\nD. Electronic Image Files (Optional)\nYou will have the greatest control over the appearance of\nyour figures if you are able to prepare electronic image files.\nIf you do not have the required computer skills, just submit\npaper prints as described above and skip this section.\n1) Easiest Way: If you have a scanner, the best and quickest\nway to prepare noncolor figure files is to print your tables and\nfigures on paper exactly as you want them to appear, scan\nthem, and then save them to a file in PostScript (PS) or\nEncapsulated PostScript (EPS) formats. Use a separate file for\neach image. File names should be of the form \"fig1.ps\" or\n\"fig2.eps.\"\n2) Slightly Harder Way: Using a scanner as above, save the\nimages in TIFF format. High-contrast line figures and tables\nshould be prepared with 600 dpi resolution and saved with no\ncompression, 1 bit per pixel (monochrome), with file names of\nthe form \"fig3.tif\" or \"table1.tif.\" To obtain a 3.45-in figure\n(one-column width) at 600 dpi, the figure requires a horizontal\nsize of 2070 pixels. Typical file sizes will be on the order of\n0.5 MB.\nPhotographs and grayscale figures should be prepared with\n220 dpi resolution and saved with no compression, 8 bits per\npixel (grayscale). To obtain a 3.45-in figure (one-column\nwidth) at 220 dpi, the figure should have a horizontal size of\n759 pixels.\nColor figures should be prepared with 400 dpi resolution\nand saved with no compression, 8 bits per pixel (palette or\n256 color). To obtain a 3.45-in figure (one column width) at\n400 dpi, the figure should have a horizontal size of 1380\npixels.\nFor more information on TIFF files, please go to\nhttp://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/informati\non.htm and click on the link \"Guidelines for Author Supplied\nElectronic Text and Graphics.\"\n3) Somewhat Harder Way: If you do not have a scanner,\nyou may create noncolor PostScript figures by \"printing\" them\nto files. First, download a PostScript printer driver from\nhttp://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/pdrvwin.htm\n(for\nWindows) or from http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/\npdrvmac.htm (for Macintosh) and install the \"Generic\nPostScript Printer\" definition. In Word, paste your figure into\na new document. Print to a file using the PostScript printer\ndriver. File names should be of the form \"fig5.ps.\" Use Adobe\nType 1 fonts when creating your figures, if possible.\n4) Other Ways: Experienced computer users can convert\nfigures and tables from their original format to TIFF. Some\nuseful image converters are Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw,\nand Microsoft Photo Editor, an application that is part of\nMicrosoft Office 97 and Office 2000 (look for C:\\Program\nFiles\\Common\nFiles\n\\Microsoft\nShared\\\nPhotoEd\\\nPHOTOED.EXE. (You may have to custom-install Photo\nEditor from your original Office disk.)\nHere is a way to make TIFF image files of tables. First,\ncreate your table in Word. Use horizontal lines but no vertical\nlines. Hide gridlines (Table | Hide Gridlines). Spell check the\ntable to remove any red underlines that indicate spelling\nerrors. Adjust magnification (View | Zoom) such that you can\nview the entire table at maximum area when you select View |\nFull Screen. Move the cursor so that it is out of the way. Press\n\"Print Screen\" on your keyboard; this copies the screen image\nto the Windows clipboard. Open Microsoft Photo Editor and\nclick Edit | Paste as New Image. Crop the table image (click\nSelect button; select the part you want, then Image | Crop).\nAdjust the properties of the image (File | Properties) to\nmonochrome (1 bit) and 600 pixels per inch. Resize the image\n(Image | Resize) to a width of 3.45 inches. Save the file (File |\nSave As) in TIFF with no compression (click \"More\" button).\nMost graphing programs allow you to save graphs in TIFF;\nhowever, you often have no control over compression or\nnumber of bits per pixel. You should open these image files in\na program such as Microsoft Photo Editor and re-save them\nusing no compression, either 1 or 8 bits, and either 600 or 220\ndpi resolution (File | Properties; Image | Resize). See Section\nII-D2 for an explanation of number of bits and resolution. If\nyour graphing program cannot export to TIFF, you can use the\nsame technique described for tables in the previous paragraph.\nA way to convert a figure from Windows Metafile (WMF)\nto TIFF is to paste it into Microsoft PowerPoint, save it in\nJPG format, open it with Microsoft Photo Editor or similar\nconverter, and re-save it as TIFF.\n\nMicrosoft Excel allows you to save spreadsheet charts in\nGraphics Interchange Format (GIF). To get good resolution,\nmake the Excel charts very large. Then use the \"Save as\n\nHTML\" feature (see http://support.microsoft.com/support/\nkb/articles/q158/0/79.asp). You can then convert from GIF to\nTIFF using Microsoft Photo Editor, for example.\nNo matter how you convert your images, it is a good idea to\nprint the TIFF files to make sure nothing was lost in the\nconversion.\nIf you modify this document for use with other IEEE\njournals or conferences, you should save it as type \"Word 97-\n2000 & 6.0/95 - RTF (*.doc)\" so that it can be opened by any\nversion of Word.\nE. Copyright Form\nAn IEEE copyright form should accompany your final\nsubmission. You can get a .pdf, .html, or .doc version at\nhttp://www.ieee.org/copyright or from the first issues in each\nvolume of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS. Authors\nare responsible for obtaining any security clearances.\n\nIII. MATH\nIf you are using Word, use either the Microsoft Equation\nEditor or the MathType add-on (http://www.mathtype.com)\nfor equations in your paper (Insert | Object | Create New |\nMicrosoft Equation or MathType Equation). \"Float over text\"\nshould not be selected.\n\nIV. UNITS\nUse either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are\nstrongly encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary\nunits (in parentheses). This applies to papers in data\nstorage. For example, write \"15 Gb/cm2 (100 Gb/in2).\" An\nexception is when English units are used as identifiers in\ntrade, such as \"31⁄2 in disk drive.\" Avoid combining SI and\nCGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in\noersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do\nnot balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units,\nclearly state the units for each quantity in an equation.\nThe SI unit for magnetic field strength H is A/m. However,\nif you wish to use units of T, either refer to magnetic flux\ndensity B or magnetic field strength symbolized as μ0H. Use\nthe center dot to separate compound units, e.g., \"A·m2.\"\nTABLE I\nUNITS FOR MAGNETIC PROPERTIES\nSymbol\nQuantity\nConversion from Gaussian and\nCGS EMU to SI a\nΦ\nmagnetic flux\n1 Mx → 10-8 Wb = 10-8 V·s\nB\nmagnetic flux density,\nmagnetic induction\n1 G → 10-4 T = 10-4 Wb/m2\nH\nmagnetic field strength\n1 Oe → 103/(4π) A/m\nm\nmagnetic moment\n1 erg/G = 1 emu\n→ 10-3 A·m2 = 10-3 J/T\nM\nmagnetization\n1 erg/(G·cm3) = 1 emu/cm3\n→ 103 A/m\n4πM\nmagnetization\n1 G → 103/(4π) A/m\nσ\nspecific magnetization\n1 erg/(G·g) = 1 emu/g → 1 A·m2/kg\nj\nmagnetic dipole\nmoment\n1 erg/G = 1 emu\n→ 4π × 10-10 Wb·m\nJ\nmagnetic polarization\n1 erg/(G·cm3) = 1 emu/cm3\n→ 4π × 10-4 T\nχ, κ\nsusceptibility\n1 → 4π\nχρ\nmass susceptibility\n1 cm3/g → 4π × 10-3 m3/kg\nμ\npermeability\n1 → 4π × 10-7 H/m\n= 4π × 10-7 Wb/(A·m)\nμr\nrelative permeability\nμ → μr\nw, W\nenergy density\n1 erg/cm3 → 10-1 J/m3\nN, D\ndemagnetizing factor\n1 → 1/(4π)\nNo vertical lines in table. Statements that serve as captions for the entire\ntable do not need footnote letters.\naGaussian units are the same as cgs emu for magnetostatics; Mx =\nmaxwell, G = gauss, Oe = oersted; Wb = weber, V = volt, s = second, T =\ntesla, m = meter, A = ampere, J = joule, kg = kilogram, H = henry.\n\nFig. 1. Magnetization as a function of applied field. Note that \"Fig.\" is\nabbreviated. There is a period after the figure number, followed by two\nspaces. It is good practice to explain the significance of the figure in the\ncaption.\n\nV. HELPFUL HINTS\nA. Figures and Tables\nBecause IEEE will do the final formatting of your paper,\nyou do not need to position figures and tables at the top and\nbottom of each column. In fact, all figures, figure captions,\nand tables can be at the end of the paper. Large figures and\ntables may span both columns. Place figure captions below the\nfigures; place table titles above the tables. If your figure has\ntwo parts, include the labels \"(a)\" and \"(b)\" as part of the\nartwork. Please verify that the figures and tables you mention\nin the text actually exist. Please do not include captions as\npart of the figures. Do not put captions in \"text boxes\"\nlinked to the figures. Do not put borders around the\noutside of your figures. Use the abbreviation \"Fig.\" even at\nthe beginning of a sentence. Do not abbreviate \"Table.\"\nTables are numbered with Roman numerals.\nColor printing of figures is available, but is billed to the\n\nauthors (approximately $1300, depending on the number of\nfigures and number of pages containing color). Include a note\nwith your final paper indicating that you request color\nprinting. Do not use color unless it is necessary for the\nproper interpretation of your figures. If you want reprints\nof your color article, the reprint order should be submitted\npromptly. There is an additional charge of $81 per 100 for\ncolor reprints.\nFigure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use\nwords rather than symbols. As an example, write the quantity\n\"Magnetization,\" or \"Magnetization M,\" not just \"M.\" Put\nunits in parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. As in\nFig. 1, for example, write \"Magnetization (A/m)\" or\n\"Magnetization (A ⋅m-1),\" not just \"A/m.\" Do not label axes\nwith a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write\n\"Temperature (K),\" not \"Temperature/K.\"\nMultipliers\ncan\nbe\nespecially\nconfusing.\nWrite\n\"Magnetization (kA/m)\" or \"Magnetization (103 A/m).\" Do\nnot write \"Magnetization (A/m) × 1000\" because the reader\nwould not know whether the top axis label in Fig. 1 meant\n16000 A/m or 0.016 A/m. Figure labels should be legible,\napproximately 8 to 12 point type.\nB. References\nNumber citations consecutively in square brackets [1]. The\nsentence punctuation follows the brackets [2]. Multiple\nreferences [2], [3] are each numbered with separate brackets\n[1]-[3]. When citing a section in a book, please give the\nrelevant page numbers [2]. In sentences, refer simply to the\nreference number, as in [3]. Do not use \"Ref. [3]\" or\n\"reference [3]\" except at the beginning of a sentence:\n\"Reference [3] shows ... .\" Unfortunately the IEEE document\ntranslator cannot handle automatic endnotes in Word;\ntherefore, type the reference list at the end of the paper using\nthe \"References\" style.\nNumber footnotes separately in superscripts (Insert |\nFootnote).1 Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the\ncolumn in which it is cited; do not put footnotes in the\nreference list (endnotes). Use letters for table footnotes (see\nTable I).\nPlease note that the references at the end of this document\nare in the preferred referencing style. Give all authors' names;\ndo not use \"et al.\" unless there are six authors or more. Use a\nspace after authors' initials. Papers that have not been\npublished should be cited as \"unpublished\" [4]. Papers that\nhave been submitted for publication should be cited as\n\"submitted for publication\" [5]. Papers that have been\naccepted for publication, but not yet specified for an issue\nshould be cited as \"to be published\" [6]. Please give\naffiliations and addresses for private communications [7].\nCapitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for\nproper nouns and element symbols. For papers published in\ntranslation journals, please give the English citation first,\nfollowed by the original foreign-language citation [8].\n\n1It is recommended that footnotes be avoided (except for the unnumbered\nfootnote with the receipt date on the first page). Instead, try to integrate the\nfootnote information into the text.\nC. Abbreviations and Acronyms\nDefine abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are\nused in the text, even after they have already been defined in\nthe abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, ac, and dc do not\nhave to be defined. Abbreviations that incorporate periods\nshould not have spaces: write \"C.N.R.S.,\" not \"C. N. R. S.\"\nDo not use abbreviations in the title unless they are\nunavoidable (for example, \"IEEE\" in the title of this article).\nD. Equations\nNumber equations consecutively with equation numbers in\nparentheses flush with the right margin, as in (1). First use the\nequation editor to create the equation. Then select the\n\"Equation\" markup style. Press the tab key and write the\nequation number in parentheses. To make your equations\nmore compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function,\nor appropriate exponents. Use parentheses to avoid\nambiguities in denominators. Punctuate equations when they\nare part of a sentence, as in\n\n.\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)|\n|\n(\nexp\n)]\n(\n/\n[\n)\n,\n(\nλ\nλ\nλ\nλ\nλ\nμ\nσ\nφ\nφ\nd\nr\nJ\nr\nJ\nz\nz\nr\nd\ndr\nr\nF\ni\ni\nj\nr\n-\ninf\n-\n-\n⋅\n=\n∫\n∫\n\n(1)\n\nBe sure that the symbols in your equation have been\ndefined before the equation appears or immediately following.\nItalicize symbols (T might refer to temperature, but T is the\nunit tesla). Refer to \"(1),\" not \"Eq. (1)\" or \"equation (1),\"\nexcept at the beginning of a sentence: \"Equation (1) is ... .\"\nE. Other Recommendations\nUse one space after periods and colons. Hyphenate complex\nmodifiers: \"zero-field-cooled magnetization.\" Avoid dangling\nparticiples, such as, \"Using (1), the potential was calculated.\"\n[It is not clear who or what used (1).] Write instead, \"The\npotential was calculated by using (1),\" or \"Using (1), we\ncalculated the potential.\"\nUse a zero before decimal points: \"0.25,\" not \".25.\" Use\n\"cm3,\" not \"cc.\" Indicate sample dimensions as \"0.1 cm × 0.2\ncm,\" not \"0.1 × 0.2 cm2.\" The abbreviation for \"seconds\" is\n\"s,\" not \"sec.\" Do not mix complete spellings and\nabbreviations of units: use \"Wb/m2\" or \"webers per square\nmeter,\" not \"webers/m2.\" When expressing a range of values,\nwrite \"7 to 9\" or \"7-9,\" not \"7~9.\"\nA parenthetical statement at the end of a sentence is\npunctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A\nparenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)\nIn American English, periods and commas are within\nquotation marks, like \"this period.\" Other punctuation is\n\"outside\"! Avoid contractions; for example, write \"do not\"\ninstead of \"don't.\" The serial comma is preferred: \"A, B, and\nC\" instead of \"A, B and C.\"\nIf you wish, you may write in the first person singular or\nplural and use the active voice (\"I observed that ...\" or \"We\n\nobserved that ...\" instead of \"It was observed that ...\").\nRemember to check spelling. If your native language is not\nEnglish, please get a native English-speaking colleague to\nproofread your paper.\n\nVI. SOME COMMON MISTAKES\nThe word \"data\" is plural, not singular. The subscript for\nthe permeability of vacuum μ0 is zero, not a lowercase letter\n\"o.\" The term for residual magnetization is \"remanence\"; the\nadjective is \"remanent\"; do not write \"remnance\" or\n\"remnant.\" Use the word \"micrometer\" instead of \"micron.\" A\ngraph within a graph is an \"inset,\" not an \"insert.\" The word\n\"alternatively\" is preferred to the word \"alternately\" (unless\nyou really mean something that alternates). Use the word\n\"whereas\" instead of \"while\" (unless you are referring to\nsimultaneous events). Do not use the word \"essentially\" to\nmean \"approximately\" or \"effectively.\" Do not use the word\n\"issue\" as a euphemism for \"problem.\" When compositions\nare not specified, separate chemical symbols by en-dashes; for\nexample, \"NiMn\" indicates the intermetallic compound\nNi0.5Mn0.5 whereas \"Ni-Mn\" indicates an alloy of some\ncomposition NixMn1-x.\nBe aware of the different meanings of the homophones\n\"affect\" (usually a verb) and \"effect\" (usually a noun),\n\"complement\" and \"compliment,\" \"discreet\" and \"discrete,\"\n\"principal\" (e.g., \"principal investigator\") and \"principle\"\n(e.g., \"principle of measurement\"). Do not confuse \"imply\"\nand \"infer.\"\nPrefixes such as \"non,\" \"sub,\" \"micro,\" \"multi,\" and\n\"\"ultra\" are not independent words; they should be joined to\nthe words they modify, usually without a hyphen. There is no\nperiod after the \"et\" in the Latin abbreviation \"et al.\" (it is also\nitalicized). The abbreviation \"i.e.,\" means \"that is,\" and the\nabbreviation \"e.g.,\" means \"for example\" (these abbreviations\nare not italicized).\nAn excellent style manual and source of information for\nscience writers is [9]. A general IEEE style guide, Information\nfor\nAuthors,\nis\navailable\nat\nhttp://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/informati\non.htm\n\nVII. EDITORIAL POLICY\nSubmission of a manuscript is not required for participation\nin a conference. Do not submit a reworked version of a paper\nyou have submitted or published elsewhere. Do not publish\n\"preliminary\" data or results. The submitting author is\nresponsible for obtaining agreement of all coauthors and any\nconsent required from sponsors before submitting a paper.\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS strongly discourage\ncourtesy authorship. It is the obligation of the authors to cite\nrelevant prior work.\nThe Transactions and Journals Department does not publish\nconference records or proceedings. The TRANSACTIONS does\npublish papers related to conferences that have been\nrecommended for publication on the basis of peer review. As\na matter of convenience and service to the technical\ncommunity, these topical papers are collected and published in\none issue of the TRANSACTIONS.\nAt least two reviews are required for every paper submitted.\nFor conference-related papers, the decision to accept or reject\na paper is made by the conference editors and publications\ncommittee; the recommendations of the referees are advisory\nonly. Undecipherable English is a valid reason for rejection.\nAuthors of rejected papers may revise and resubmit them to\nthe TRANSACTIONS as regular papers, whereupon they will be\nreviewed by two new referees.\n\nVIII. PUBLICATION PRINCIPLES\nThe contents of IEEE TRANSACTIONS and JOURNALS are\npeer-reviewed and archival. The TRANSACTIONS publishes\nscholarly articles of archival value as well as tutorial\nexpositions and critical reviews of classical subjects and\ntopics of current interest.\nAuthors should consider the following points:\n1) Technical papers submitted for publication must advance\nthe state of knowledge and must cite relevant prior work.\n2) The length of a submitted paper should be commensurate\nwith the importance, or appropriate to the complexity, of\nthe work. For example, an obvious extension of\npreviously published work might not be appropriate for\npublication or might be adequately treated in just a few\npages.\n3) Authors must convince both peer reviewers and the\neditors of the scientific and technical merit of a paper; the\nstandards of proof are higher when extraordinary or\nunexpected results are reported.\n4) Because replication is required for scientific progress,\npapers submitted for publication must provide sufficient\ninformation to allow readers to perform similar\nexperiments or calculations and use the reported results.\nAlthough not everything need be disclosed, a paper must\ncontain new, useable, and fully described information.\nFor example, a specimen's chemical composition need not\nbe reported if the main purpose of a paper is to introduce\na new measurement technique. Authors should expect to\nbe challenged by reviewers if the results are not supported\nby adequate data and critical details.\n5) Papers that describe ongoing work or announce the latest\ntechnical achievement, which are suitable for presentation\nat a professional conference, may not be appropriate for\npublication in a TRANSACTIONS or JOURNAL.\n\nIX. CONCLUSION\nA conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion\nmay review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the\nabstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on\n\nthe importance of the work or suggest applications and\nextensions.\nAPPENDIX\nAppendixes, if needed, appear before the acknowledgment.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe preferred spelling of the word \"acknowledgment\" in\nAmerican English is without an \"e\" after the \"g.\" Use the\nsingular heading even if you have many acknowledgments.\nAvoid expressions such as \"One of us (S.B.A.) would like to\nthank ... .\" Instead, write \"F. A. Author thanks ... .\" Sponsor\nand financial support acknowledgments are placed in the\nunnumbered footnote on the first page.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\nG. O.

Sriram, S. Subramanian, and G. Tomlin\nAbstract We document an experimental study to optimize yield\nof an ethanol distillation process. The yield is expressed in terms\nof concentration of the ethanol obtained, and the profit from the\nprocess. Concentration is a function of six input factors that can\nbe varied within a given range. Profit is a function of the revenue\n(which depends on the concentration of ethanol achieved) and\ncosts (which vary with the input factor settings).\nWe started by determining a practical operating range for the six\ninput parameters where the constraints of the system (pressure in\nthe distillation column and holding tanks) were not violated. We\nthen conducted a factorial experimental analysis and used a\nresponse surface method (path of steepest ascent) to determine an\noperating point where the desired concentration level is achieved.\nFinally, we used a space filling experimental design in a narrow\nregion around the operating point to determine the effect of\nvarious input parameters on robustness and profit.\nIndex Terms--Ethanol, Design of Experiments, Optimization\nO\nI. PROBLEM DEFINITION\nur team found a distillation simulator [2] that was used as\nthe basis of a project at Virginia Tech. This simulator\ncan be found at www.stat.vt.edu/~vining. The simulator takes\nan input of 6 factors and gives outputs of concentration, profit\nand pressure. The objective is to maximize profit by changing\nthe six factors.\nThe six factors are:\nFeed Rate\n(gallons per minute)\nFeed Temperature\n(Fahrenheit)\nDistillate Rate\n(gallons per minute)\nCondensate Temperature\n(Fahrenheit)\nReboil Temperature\n(Fahrenheit)\nReflux ratio\n(percent)\nHaving no knowledge of the operating conditions, we were\nprovided with costs, revenues, and constraints. This gave us a\nbasic understanding of the premise, and we were able to use\ngiven pilot values as a starting point for our analysis.\nThe given costs are:\nFixed Costs\n$1,000 per run\nHeating Costs\n$0.08 / 100,000 Btu\nCooling Costs\n$0.04 / 100,000 Btu\nRaw Material Costs\n$0.015 / gallon\nThe given revenue is:\nconcentration < 80%\n= $ 0\n80%< concentration < 90%\n= $ .50/gallon\n90%< concentration < 95%\n= $1.00/gallon\n95%< concentration < 100% = $1.25/gallon\nConstraints given are pressure limits. If maximum pressure\nis exceeded then the process fails, no product is made and\nrepair costs are extraordinary.\nII. EXPERIMENTS/DATA\nA. Determining operating range for experimental factors\nAs described earlier, the ethanolwater distillation column\nhas six factors that can be adjusted. The setting for each factor\nhas a large range. However, every setting for each parameter is\nnot likely to produce ethanol, as some settings would violate\nthe constraints of the system (Eg: Pressure constraint of the\nholding tank and the pressure constraint of the distillation\ncolumn).\nIn order to determine the operating range (Figure 1) for each\nfactor setting we varied one factor at a time (OFAT). We took\nthe pilot settings as the starting point and fixed all but one\nfactor at the pilot setting and varied the one factor over its\nentire settings range. This process was repeated for each factor\none at a time. This approach ignored any interaction effects\nthat might exist between the different factors. Based on this\nanalysis the operating range for each factor was determined.\nThe following chart illustrates the operating range and the pilot\nsetting for each parameter.\n\n2007518 2.830 Control of Manufacturing Systems Final Project\nFeed\nRate\n(gpm)\nFeed\nTemp\n(F)\nDist\nRate\n(gpm)\nCond\nTemp\n(F)\nReboil\nTemp\n(F)\nReflux\nRatio\n(%)\nOperating Range\nPilot values\nFigure 1.

Full factorial experiment within operating range\nHaving determined the operating range, a 2level full\nfactorial experiment was run within half the operating range\nwith the midpoint of the operating range as the midpoint of\nthe experiment.\nFigure 2 shows the range for the fullfactorial experiment.\nThe white line in the figure shows the actual range over which\nthe experiment was performed.\nFigure 2.

The first step of the\nanalysis considered all 6 six factors with main effects and 2\nway interactions. Higher order terms were ignored. This first\nstep of the analysis was performed to determine which factors\nwere significant.\nThe above analysis resulted in three significant factors. The\ndata was then further analyzed in JMP with just these three\nfactors and all interactions including 3 way interactions. The\nresults of this analysis are given in the Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Parameter Estimates\nSome nonrandom residuals indicate that the behavior\nmodel may need to be enhanced to include curvature\nparameters. (Figure 4)\nFigure 4.\nResiduals as function of concentration\npredicted\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Concentration Optimization\nFrom the table of effects from the experiment above, we see\nthat the three factors that are significant are Distillate Rate,\nCondensate Temperature, and Reflux Ratio. The sign of the\nsignificant effects suggests that in order to maximize\nconcentration, we should set all three of these factors at their\nlow values, and then further decrease them along the path of\nsteepest ascent. However, if we do this, we see that the\nsignificant two way interactions have the opposite sign that\ncounteracts the increase in concentration. Hence we see that to\nincrease concentration, we should actually set the Reflux Ratio\nhigh, and continue to increase this factor.\nHaving determined that the Distillate Rate and Condensate\nTemperature should be decreased, and the Reflux Ratio should\nbe increased, we determined the path of ascent using the ratios\nof the main effects of these factors. We then moved along this\npath by decreasing the Distillate Rate by 0.1 coded units at a\ntime (equivalent to a 0.425 GPM decrease in real units), and\nchanged the other two variables proportionally. This path\nresulted in the experiments shown in Figure 5. As seen, the\nconcentration values increased and reached 94% by the fourth\nexperiment. At this point, we reduced the step to 0.05 coded\nunits, and performed two more experiments. We saw that the\nconcentration continued to increase, first to 96% and then to\n99%. However, we noticed that the profit was highest at the\n96% concentration level, and dropped off at the 99% level.\nThis makes sense, since the underlying revenue function yields\nthe same revenue per gallon for any concentration above 95%,\nwhile the costs increase to reach higher concentration levels.\nBased on this result, we concluded that a good operating point\nwould be the experiment that yielded 96% concentration.\n\n2007518 2.830 Control of Manufacturing Systems Final Project\nFeed Rate\nFeed Temp\nDist Rate\nCond Temp\nReboil Temp\nReflux Ratio\npoint 1\npoint 2\npoint 3\npoint 4\npoint 5\npoint 6\n100.0\n170.5\n170.5\n170.5\n170.5\n170.5\n170.5\n7.3\n6.8\n6.40\n5.98\n5.55\n5.8\n240.5\n240.3\n240.0\n239.8\n239.5\n239.6\n290.0\n290.0\n290.0\n290.0\n290.0\n290.0\n61.8\n62.4\n63.0\n63.6\n64.3\n64.0\nConc\n78%\n84%\n88%\n94%\n99%\n96%\nProfit\n$\n(5,400) $\n(369) $\n(551) $\n3,566 $\n5,061 $\n5,441\n60%\n65%\n70%\n75%\n80%\n85%\n90%\n95%\n100%\n$(6,000)\n$(4,000)\n$(2,000)\n$\n$2,000\n$4,000\n$6,000\nConc.\nProfit\nFigure 5: Experiments along path of steepest ascent:\nconcentration and profit levels\nB. Profit Optimization\nHaving arrived at an operating point that yielded the desired\nconcentration level, our next step was to explore the region\naround this operating point. There were two main reasons for\nthis: (a) we wanted to make sure that the operating point was\nrobust, i.e. a slight change in the factors would not result in\nslipping below the 95% concentration level with a dramatic\nloss in profit, and (b) we wanted to determine the effect of\nfactor changes on profit, to maximize profit.\nWe conducted a Latin Hypercube space filling experiment in\na +/2% range around the operating point. A total of 64\nexperiments were conducted. The results for concentration and\nprofit level are shown in the 3D plots below, which are coded\nby color level. The results show the highly nonlinear behavior\nof the concentration and profit functions. In fact, even in this\nnarrow 2% range of variation, a few treatment points resulted\nin a negative profit since the pressure limits were exceeded\nand the experiment failed.\nFigure 6 and 7 show the level of concentration and profit\nresponse at a given level of the 3 input factors. The color\nindicates the level of the output.\nFigure 8 shows a sliced contour [profit vs. reflux ratio] at a\ncertain level of distillate rate and condensate temperature. The\nstep function nature of profit is clearly seen in this figure.\nFigure 6. Concentration as a function of input factors\nFigure 7. Profit as a function of input factors\nFigure 8. Variation of profit (slice)\n\n2007518 2.830 Control of Manufacturing Systems Final Project\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Experimental Design\nThe simulation tool that models the ethanol process does not\nseem to imitate a physical process because of its nonlinear\nnature. Speaking with the operators in a real setting would\ngive us a much better idea of what the operating ranges would\nbe, what the initial pilot points would be, and how to go about\nsetting up the experiments.\nAlternatively, the simulation tool allowed us to run\nexperiments very easily. If we were running these in actuality,\nwe would have had to have been much more calculated in our\nexploration of the factors and their effects.\nIn this project we had two objectives.\nEssentially we\nwanted to maximize profit.\nBecause profit was varied so\ndramatically with concentration, we found that it was easier to\nmaximize concentration first. Then, we made adjustments to\nfinetune the concentration around the maximum profit.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe conducted an experimental study to optimize the yield\n(concentration and profit) from an ethanol distillation process.\nWhile profit maximization was the primary objective, we\nchose to start by optimizing concentration, and then\nmaximized profit once an operating point that yielded a high\nconcentration was achieved. This approach was chosen\nbecause profit is a function of the concentration, and is also\nseverely impacted by process failure due to repair costs.\nWe took an approach of first finding an operating range for\nthe input parameters, and then conducting a factorial\nexperimental design and a response surface analysis to arrive\nat an optimal operating point. As a result of our study, we were\nable to determine a robust operating point that yielded a high\nconcentration (of 96%) and a high profit level (of $5441).\nOur study illustrated the importance of understanding the\nunderlying process in selecting a suitable experimental design\nand a good pilot operating point.\nVI. LESSONS LEARNED\nA. Understand your process\nA solid understanding of the process is very important to\nrunning a successful experiment. This understanding helps\nwith everything, from setting correct experimental levels to\ninterpreting data correctly. To learn about the process it is\nimportant to either speak with operators or learn about the\ntechnology and theory. Understanding to model was difficult\nin this case, and would have been much easier if we had been\nable to ask questions.\nB.

Determine endpoint when cantilever released,\noveretching is okay since anisotropic. The wet etch contributes primarily to the z-direction geometry of the part since\nsidewall angles are determined by the etchant used (KOH is anisotropic) and the crystallographic orientation of the silicon\nsubstrate.\nYoung's modulus and density are functions of the bulk silicon, and are process independent. However, since stiffness and\ndensity are also functions of volume, and therefore geometry, they are affected by both lithography resolution and etch\ntime/chemical.\n\nc) Process parameters:\nPhotolithography\n- Equipment state\n- UV on/off, power density of tool, time of exposure\n- Equipment properties\n- UV power density dependence on temperature/time\n- Material states\n- Prepolymer, exposed polymer, developed/cured polymer\n- Material properties\n- Viscosity, catalytic density\nWet chemical etching\n- Equipment state\n- Concentration, temperature, time of KOH\n- Equipment properties\n- KOH etch rate as a function of conc, temp, time\n- Material states\n- Bulk silicon, silicon and KOH product\n- Material properties\n- Crystallographic orientation, silicon type, mask material\n\nd) Control variables:\nPhotolithography - Exposure time, softbake time, softbake temperature, develop time, develop spin speed\nWet chemical etching - Chemical etchant, etchant concentration, chemical bath temperature, etch time\n\ne) Output sensitivity to control variables:\nPhotolithography\nExposure time, softbake time, softbake temperature, develop time, develop spin speed - all affect the width and length of\nthe oxide mask used to etch the cantilever.

In this question we will consider the\nsensitivity of the etched depth to variations of etch time, KOH concentration and temperature.\na) Determine the sensitivity of etched depth to\ni.\netch time;\nii. KOH concentration;\niii. solution temperature\n\nfor the following two sets of nominal parameters:\n1. etch time = 5 minutes; KOH concentration = 40 wt%; solution temperature = 72 °C;\nFrom Fig 1, etch rate is 42 μm/h under these conditions.\ni.\nSensitivity of etched depth to time = 42 μm/h;\nii.\nSensitivity to concentration: draw tangent to rate-concentration curve at 40 wt%, giving a sensitivity\nof (-25 μm/h)/(20 wt%) * (5/60)h = -0.10 μm/wt%;\niii.\nEtch rate R = R0exp(-Ea/kT); ∂R/∂T = (R0Ea/kT2) exp(-Ea/kT) = REa/kT2. Thus sensitivity of depth to\ntemperature is 42 μm/h * (0.6 * 1.60 × 10-19 J) * (5/60) h / (1.38 × 10-23 J/K * (72+273)2 K2)\n= 0.21 μm/K.\n\n2. etch time = 1 hour; KOH concentration = 20 wt%; solution temperature = 40 °C.\nEtch rate at 20 wt% and 72 °C is 55 μm/h (from Fig. 1). Use Arrhenius Law to convert this to an etch rate at\n40 °C:\n\nR(40 °C) = R(72 °C) * exp{[1/(72+273) - 1/(40+273)] * (0.6 * 1.60 × 10-19 J)/(1.38 × 10-23 J/K)} = 7.0 μm/h.\ni.\nSensitivity of etched depth to time = 7.0 μm/h;\nii.\nSensitivity to concentration: 20 wt% is at the peak of the rate-concentration curve, so sensitivity to\nconcentration is approximately zero here.\niii.\nSensitivity of depth to temperature is 7.0 μm/h * (0.6 * 1.60 × 10-19 J) * 1 h / (1.38 × 10-23 J/K *\n(40+273)2 K2) = 0.50 μm/K.\n\nTo answer this question you can use the information in Figure 1, which is taken from Seidel et al., J. Electrochemical\nSociety, vol. 137, no. 11, pp. 3612-3626, 1990. You may also assume that the etch rate, R, follows the Arrhenius\nrelation: R = R0exp(-Ea/kT) with an activation energy Ea of 0.6 eV, independent of temperature and KOH\nconcentration. R0 may be derived from Figure 1, and may be assumed to be a function of KOH concentration but\nindependent of temperature. T is the temperature in Kelvin, k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10-23 J/K), and there are\n1.60 × 10-19 J in 1 eV.\n\nb) Provide reasoned estimates of how well it is possible to control:\ni.\netch time (hint: the silicon wafer to be etched is usually immersed in a bath of the KOH solution during\netching);\n\nSuggest that removal from solution can be timed to ±10s; wafer would have to be rinsed in DI water to stop\nthe etch. Many reasonable suggestions were made and justified, varying from ~1 s to ~1 min.\n\nii. KOH concentration (hint: the KOH solution is prepared either by diluting concentrated solution or by\ndissolving KOH pellets in water);\n\nSay 1 L is mixed; the mass of KOH could be measured with electronic scales to ±1 g, giving a variability of\n±0.1 wt% in the concentration. Factors such as water evaporation during etching and progressive consumption\nof reactant might also be usefully mentioned.\n\niii. solution temperature (hint: the KOH solution is usually contained in a temperature-controlled water bath).\n\nIt seems reasonable to be able to control the temperature to within ±2 °C of the target - thorough answers\nmight consider the resolution of thermometers, the thermal capacity of a water bath, or make some remark\nabout the specifications of typical laboratory water baths.\nc) Using your answers to (a) and (b), deduce which of the three machine states (temperature, time, concentration)\ncontributes the largest portion of the variability of the etched depth in each of the two cases evaluated.\nParameter\nLikely input\nvariability\nCase 1, sensitivity\nCase 1, resulting\ndepth variability\nCase 2, sensitivity\nCase 2, resulting\ndepth variability\nEtch time\n± 10 s\n42 μm/h\n± 0.12 μm\n7.0 μm/h\n± 0.02 μm\nKOH\nconcentration\n± 0.1 wt%\n-0.10 μm/wt%;\n± 0.01 μm\n~ 0\n~ 0\ntemperature\n± 2 °C\n0.21 μm/K\n± 0.42 μm\n0.50 μm/K\n± 1.0 μm\nUnder these assumptions, temperature variability contributes the largest proportion of etched-depth variability. Other\nlegitimate assumptions might give quite a different result, however.\nd) If you needed to etch to a depth of 100 μm, what is the smallest depth variability that could be achieved using a timed\nKOH etch? (Hint: focus on the sensitivity of etched depth to temperature. Express the sensitivity of etched depth to\ntemperature in terms of the target depth, temperature and physical constants. Then decide what temperature to use and\ncompute the likely resulting variability. Think about physical constraints on your selection of parameters. Finally, check\nthe depth variability due to time and concentration variations.)\nGiven a target depth and the requirement to choose a temperature, etch time and KOH concentration, there are two\ndegrees of freedom (once a temperature and KOH concentration are chosen, for example, the etch rate is set, so the\nrequired etch time is determined).\nSelect operating temperature:\nFrom above: ∂R/∂T = (R0Ea/kT2) exp(-Ea/kT) = REa/kT2\nBut sensitivity of final etched depth = ∂R/∂T * (etch time)\nand (etch time) = (target etch depth)/R\nso sensitivity of final etched depth = dEa/kT2 where d is the target etch depth. We see that for a fixed depth, variability\ndecreases with temperature, so make the temperature as high as possible. We might expect the aqueous solution to boil if\nwe go above 100 °C (in fact research [Tanaka et al., Proc. IEEE Transducers 2003, Boston] has shown that the boiling\npoint increases with KOH concentration -to about 135 °C at ~ 40 wt%); perhaps limit the temperature to 85 °C to avoid\nexcessive evaporation during the etch, which will need to last about an hour.\nFor a target depth of 100 μm the temperature-related variability is therefore\n(100 μm)* (0.6 * 1.60 × 10-19 J) / (1.38 × 10-23 J/K * (85+273)2 K2) * 2 K = 11 μm.\nSo timed KOH etches have a variability of ~ 10% under the assumptions made here. These calculations are however for\nblanket etches; KOH etches are usually used with a mask that interacts with the silicon crystal structure to cause the etch\nto terminate in a position with a precision on the order of that with which the mask is fabricated. If precise blanket\netches are needed, etch stops (e.g. electrochemical) are possible.\n\nCheck other parameters:\nEtch rate at 85 °C, 20 wt% KOH gives 87 μm/h. So the time to etch 100 μm is 1.1 h. Depth variability due to etch time\nvariability = 87 μm/h * (10/3600)h = 0.24 μm. Much smaller than the variability due to temperature.\nWe chose 20 wt% KOH, where ∂R/∂C ~ 0.\nNote:\nThe optimal choice of temperature and KOH concentration depends on the assumptions you made in part (b) about\nvariability of etch time, KOH concentration and temperature. The Excel spreadsheet embedded below can be used to\nfind an optimal operating point. In the spreadsheet I have modeled the dependence of etch rate on KOH concentration as\na quadratic function, with a maximum at 20% - this seems to resemble the published data rather well. You enter your\nassumptions about input variabilities in the light green cells, and the spreadsheet is set up to use the Solver plug-in to\nfind the appropriate temperature and concentration for a minimal variability of etched depth.\nBroadly, as your assumption about concentration variability gets more optimistic and/or your assumption about etch\ntime variability becomes more pessimistic, the optimal KOH concentration can start to increase from 20% (20%\nconcentration gives zero sensitivity to concentration, but a maximal etch rate for a given temperature - and that fast\netch-rate can prove problematic if etch time is relatively poorly controlled).\n\nDouble-click on the chart below to enter Excel and run the optimization:\n2.830/6.780 PS1 Q3: go to Tools > Solver to run\nLegend:\nvalue optimized by Excel\nvalue calculated by Excel\nuser input\nParameter:\nTime (h)\nTemperature (Centigrade)\nKOH concentration (wt%)\nNominal value\n1.52E+00\n91.74048714\n56.27995748\nInput variability\n0.016666667\nPartial sensitivity of etched depth (micron/{h,K,wt%})\n65.79990444\n5.22906691\n-8.210320706\nComponents of depth variability (micron)\n1.096665074\n10.45813382\n-8.210320706\nR_0 (micron/h)\n1.26E+10\nTarget depth (micron)\nEtch rate (micron/h)\n6.58E+01\nOutput variability (micron)\n19.7651196\nConstants:\nk (J/K)\n1.38E-23\nE _a (J)\n9.6E-20\nKOH concentration\nRate (micron/h at 72 C)\n52.5\n53.4\n54.1\n54.6\n54.9\n54.9\n54.6\n54.1\n53.4\n52.5\n51.4\n50.1\n48.6\n46.9\n42.9\n40.6\n38.1\n35.4\n32.5\n29.4\n26.1\n22.6\n18.9\nEtch rate vs. KOH concentration, 72 C\n10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60\nKOH concentration (wt%)\nEtch rate (micron/h)"

We can discuss on an individual basis when selecting term\nprojects.\nProblem 2\nLet x be the concentration of particles in particles/ft3:\nx ~ N(15.08, 0.025)\nSince the acceptable concentration range is 15.00 ± 0.10 particles/ft3, the probability that a system\nconforms to specifications is:\nP(14.9 ≤ x ≤ 15.1)\n=\nP(x ≤ 15.10) - P(x ≤ 14.90)\n=\nΦ([15.10-15.08]/0.05) - Φ([14.90-15.08]/0.05)\n=\nΦ([15.10-15.08]/0.05) - {1 - Φ([15.08-14.90]/0.05)}\n=\n0.06554 - 1.59 × 10-4\n\n=\n65.5%\nProblem 3\nBecause we know neither the population's mean nor its standard deviation, we need to use a t-test. The\nsample size is 10 so the number of degrees of freedom is 10 - 1 = 9. A 99% confidence interval on the\nmean photoresist thickness is given by:\n≤\nμ ≤\nx + t(0.01/ 2),9 10\nx - t(0.01/ 2),9\ns\ns\nwhere the sample mean is\nx = 13.3962 μm\nand the sample variance is\ns2 = 1 ∑(x - x)\n2 = 1.5277 ×10-5 μm2 .\nFrom tables, t0.005,9 = 3.250. The 99% confidence interval is therefore:\n13.3922 μm ≤ μ ≤ 13.4002 μm.\n\nProblem 4\na) Histograms and normal probability plots for shearing data, sorted by material and end-of-sample.\nHistogram of sheared widths 1\nNormal probability plot: width 1\n0.99\n0.98\n0.95\n0.90\nAluminum\nSteel\nFrequency\nFrequency\nFrequency\nFrequency\n0.10\n0.05\n0.02\n0.01\n1.005\n1.01\n1.015\n1.02\n1.005\n1.01\n1.015\nWidth 1 (in)\nData (in)\nHistogram of sheared widths 2\nNormal probability plot: width 2\n0.99\n0.98\n0.95\n0.90\nFrequency\nFrequency\nFrequency\nFrequency\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.10\n0.05\n0.02\n0.01\n1.01\n1.02\n1.03\n1.005\n1.01\n1.015\nWidth 2 (in)\nData (in)\nHistogram of sheared widths 1\nNormal probability plot: width 1\n0.99\n0.98\n0.95\n0.90\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.10\n0.05\n0.02\n0.01\n1.01\n1.02\n1.03\n1.01\n1.015\n1.02\n1.025\nWidth 1 (in)\nData (in)\nHistogram of sheared widths 2\nNormal probability plot: width 2\n1.01\n1.02\n1.03\n0.99\n0.98\n0.95\n0.90\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.10\n0.05\n0.02\n0.01\n1.005\n1.01\n1.015\n1.02\nWidth 2 (in)\nData (in)\n\nSkewness, kurtosis and normality test results for the two materials and two widths:\nSteel\nAluminum\nWidth 1\nWidth 2\nWidth 1\nWidth 2\nSkewness\n-0.3568\n-0.7232\n0.3199\n-1.1607\nKurtosis*\n2.8899\n3.3079\n3.4622\n5.8867\nLillifors test at 5% level\nReject\nReject\nAccept\nAccept\n* Defined as 3 for a normal distribution. Values less than 3 correspond to leptokurtic distributions\n(sharper peak; fatter tails than a normal) and values larger than 3 correspond to platykurtic distributions\n(smaller peak; thinner tails).\nThe Lilliefors test examines the hypothesis that the distribution is normal. 'Reject' in the table above\nmeans that the hypothesis of normality is rejected at the 5% level. For more information see, e.g.,\nLilliefors (1967) J. Am. Stat. Assoc., vol. 62, pp. 399-402.\nExamining the normal probability plots of the data, it would seem fairly reasonable to model the\ndistributions of widths as normal, although there are some reasons to suspect that they may not be\nnormal - e.g. the steel, width 1, data are 'missing' an upper tail; the steel, width 2, normal probability\nplot has a marked curve; the aluminum, width 2, data are 'missing' an upper tail. Could the data be\nskewed towards the lower values for some physical reason? A possible operator error involves not\npressing the material hard against the stop on the shear, giving a shorter part, whereas one cannot push\nthe material beyond the stop. The rather large kurtosis of aluminum width 2 data provides a further\nsuggestion that the underlying distribution might not be normal. Meanwhile, the steel data fail the\nLilliefors test of normality at the 5% level.\nb) To test whether there is a significant taper in the parts, consider that we have two measurements, w1\nand w2, per part. A paired test is needed. If we could assume that the amount of taper, w1-w2, was\nnormally distributed, we could use a paired t-test; however, since the normal probability plots shown\nabove raise some questions over whether any of the dimensions are normally distributed, we will not\nmake this assumption and will use instead a Wilcoxon signed rank test, which does not assume any\nparticular distribution. The test is implemented in Matlab as p = signrank(x), where x is a vector\nof differences between pairs, w1-w2 in this case, and p is the probability of observing the given x, or\none more 'extreme', by chance if the median of x was in fact zero.\nFor the steel parts: p = 0.738\nFor the aluminum parts: p = 0.002\n(There are 45 samples for each material.)\nAt the 5% level, therefore, there is no statistically significant taper in the steel parts but there is a\nsignificant taper in the aluminum parts. Even removing the outlier at sample 24 of the aluminum\ndataset, the p-value increases only to 0.005; there is still a significant taper. A histogram plot of the\ndifferences shows that the median of w1-w2 is slightly negative for aluminum.\n[The use of a paired t-test is acceptable as a solution if, in the previous part, the data were interpreted as\ncoming from a normal distribution.]\n\nc) Run charts for the parts produced (blue symbols: w1; red symbols: w2):\nRun chart for steel parts\nWidth (in)\nWidth (in)\n1.025\n1.02\n1.015\n1.01\n1.005\nRun number\nRun chart for aluminum parts\n1.025\n1.02\n1.015\n1.01\n1.005\nRun number\nLooking at these run charts, it is difficult to say conclusively whether there is a mean shift for either\nmaterial as the run progresses. Perhaps the width of the steel parts drifts up over time, but to make a\nquantitative evaluation of whether or not the process is stationary, we can use a control chart. That is\nwhat we will practice in Assignment 3.\n(Incidentally, 'eyeballing' the run chart for aluminum parts suggests to me a consistent taper, with w2\nbeing slightly larger)\n\nd) For whole injection molding dataset:\nHistogram and normal probability plot:\nHistogram, whole dataset\nNormal probability plot, whole dataset\n0.99\n0.98\n0.95\n0.90\n0.75\nFrequency\nFrequency\n0.50\n0.25\n0.10\n0.05\n0.02\n0.01\n2.02\n2.03\n2.04\n2.05\n2.06\n2.07\n2.03\n2.035\n2.04\n2.045\n2.05\n2.055\nDiameter (in)\nDiameter (in)\nThe kurtosis is 2.2; the form of the normal probability plot suggests that in the center of the distribution\nan assumption of normality is reasonable, while the tails seem to be 'missing' when the experimental\ndata are compared to a normal distribution.

Since the tests of normality above suggested that the underlying\ndistributions were not normal, we cannot use a t-test. Instead we use a Wilcoxon rank sum test, which\nis distribution-independent. It is implemented in Matlab as [p,h] = ranksum(x,y) and tests the\nhypothesis that two given vectors x and y come from distributions with equal medians. p is the\nprobability of observing the given x and y, or samples more 'extreme', by chance, if the medians of x\nand y are in fact equal. h is the result of testing at the 5% level the hypothesis that x and y come\nfrom distributions with equal medians, and is equal to 1 if the null hypothesis is to be rejected.\nFor operating points 1 and 4, the rank sum test gives a p-value of 7 × 10-5, and the hypothesis that the\nunderlying means are equal is rejected at the 5% level. Therefore there is significant evidence of a\ndifference in median output between these operating points: the 'low hold, low velocity' condition\ngives smaller-diameter parts.\n[The use of a t-test is acceptable as a solution if, in the previous part, the data were interpreted as\ncoming from a normal distribution.]"

When the wafer is cleaved to separate the dies,\neach die will become a single integrated circuit. Each die contains many MOSFETs that are wished to have identical\ndimensions. In reality, these dimensions vary within each die and the mean within-die dimension varies from die to\ndie. A particular dimensional parameter of the MOSFETs produced in die 1 (near the edge of the wafer) is described\nby x1 ~ N(0,1) and the same parameter of the MOSFETs in die 2 (near the wafer's center) is described by\nx2 ~ N(d,1). A metrology expert presumes that die-to-die variability will be negligible in comparison with within-die\nvariability, and therefore samples 500 transistors from die 1 and 500 transistors from die 2, intermingling the\nsamples before analyzing them. In other words, the expert discards any information about which measurement\ncomes from which die. For values of d from 0 to 2 in steps of 0.5, use your favorite graphing software to simulate\nthese intermingled samples. Also generate a sixth sample for the case d = 4. Produce a qq-norm plot of each\ngenerated sample. If you had been given these qq-norm plots, without knowing their source, and had been asked to\nsay which of the samples were taken from a normal distribution, what would you have said?\nSubjective interpretation of qq-norm plots has its limitations. There are, however, quantitative tests of normality that\ncan be used. The Lilliefors test, for example, tests the hypothesis that the distribution underlying a given sample is\nnormal. In MATLAB's Statistics Toolbox, this test is implemented as lillietest(X, alpha) where X is a\nvector containing the samples and alpha is the level of significance at which the hypothesis is to be tested. The\nMATLAB function returns 0 if the hypothesis of normality is accepted, and 1 if rejected. What is the smallest value\nof d for which the hypothesis of normality of the intermingled sample is rejected by the Lilliefors test at the 5%\nlevel? Comment on what you find. (If you prefer to use a different test of normality, please feel free to do so.)\nNote: an additional resource on engineering statistics for semiconductor (and other manufacturing processes) is the\nNIST/SEMATECH Engineering Statistics Handbook at http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm .

To test this, a single sample of 9 tires is taken. We can assume that tire\nlife is normally distributed, and from the 9 samples determine a standard deviation of s =\n1200 miles and a sample mean of 60,578\na) Based on the one sample mean, how confident are you that the mean of the process is\n60,000?\nb) If instead, the hypothesized true mean was 59,000, how would your level of\nconfidence change, given the same single sample mean?\nc) Suppose the true mean value was indeed 59,000 but we assumed it was 60,000. We\nthen begin charting production with samples of size n=4 how long until we would it take\nuntil we realized that the grand mean was 59,000 and not 60,000?\nProblem #2 (35%)\nYou have an assembly process that yields a final dimension that is to be controlled. The\ntarget value for this dimension is 100 mm, and the specifications call for a process\ncapability Cpk = 1. However, you also note that the design specifications are not\nsymmetric, but instead given by:\nx = 100 + 2 / - 1\nThus USL = 102\nand LSL = 99\na) Process measurements show that for every 5000 parts produced you are seeing 15 parts\nout of specification. What would be the corresponding value for Cpk? Please sketch this\nsituation with a distribution, and superimposing the specifications given above.\nb) After charting the process for some time, the operator notices that the average value\nfor the process is 100.5mm not the target of 100. After consulting with the local\nmanufacturing engineer, they decide to re-center the process so that it is on target (i.e.\n100mm), since that is what the specs call for. After running with this new mean for some\ntime, they calculate the Cp and Cpk. What values would they get?\n\n2.830/SMA 6303\nQuiz 1\nMarch 10, 2005\nc) Now you come along and tell them to use the Quality Loss Function to best quantify\nthis problem. Compare the expected quality loss for the above situation to what it would\nbe if the limits were symmetric about a target of 100.5 mm.\n(NB: you can assume that the cost of exceeding either the upper or lower specification\nlimit is the same.)\nProblem 3 (30%)\nThe process variance of the thickness of a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) layer has\nhistorically been too high, and you have sought out a solution. A tool vendor comes up\nwith a new wafer chuck and claims they can reduce the process variance from 10 to 4 A2.\nHaving argued vociferously for the purchase of this tool, you are anxious to test it, but are\ntold you can only do 5 runs with the new tool before regular production must start. Given\nthis restriction you press on.\nAfter performing your tests you determine a sample variance of 10 A2. Your boss then\nsays: \"well ... did it work?\" You want there to be only a 5% chance that your answer is\nwrong, so you tell your boss _____!\nIn other words, can you claim to 95% confidence that the true process variance is 4 A2 ?\n(Hint: the advertised value of variance (4 A2) can be considered a sample variance\ndetermined with a very very (very) large number of samples.)\nPlease explain all your steps in this solution.\nPage 2 of 2"

It is known that the process is normally distributed with\nμ = 0.75 V and σ = 0.10 V.

These samples gave a grand average of 0.734 V, and average si of 0.125 V, and\nan average Ri of 0.365 V.\n+ May & Spanos, Problem 6.7.\n\nProblem 1, cont'd\nPart (c) [15%]\nThe specification limits for MOSFET threshold voltage in this process is x = 0.7 ± 0.05 V. What\nis the Cp and Cpk for this process? Assuming the process as specified in part (a) is in control,\nwhat is the fraction of MOSFETs that are nonconforming? If the process in part (a) was\nrecentered such that μx is on target at 0.7 V, what would the fraction be of MOSFETs that are\nnonconforming?\n\nProblem 2 [30%]\nPart (a) [10%]\nBased on a fairly large historical sample of gate oxide thicknesses consisting of 61 samples, an\naverage oxide thickness of 96.5 A is observed, with a variance of 6 A2. What are your best\nestimates, and 95% confidence intervals, for the process mean and process variance?\n\nPart (b) [10%]\nA change is proposed to increase the gate oxide thickness.

To 95% confidence, has the modification resulted in a process with a different variance\nthan in part (b)?\n\nProblem 3 [35%]\nYou are in charge of a process manufacturing parts whose key output parameter, x, is known to\nbe normally distributed. When the process is in control, the mean value of x is known to be μ and\nits standard deviation σ.\nUnfortunately, the supplier of an important input material for this process is rather unreliable,\nand every so often they inadvertently supply a large batch of material whose properties cause the\nmean of x to shift to μ + kσ, with the standard deviation of x remaining unchanged.\nWhen this mean shift occurs, you want to be able to identify it as quickly as possible. Your\nmetrology staff tells you that they can currently measure at most a fraction f of parts produced,\nalthough you are free to choose how this measurement budget is apportioned: i.e. you can dictate\nany n, where samples of n parts are taken at intervals of n/f parts.\nPart (a) [3%]\nWrite down, in terms of μ, σ and n, expressions for ±3σ control limits for an x control chart\nmonitoring this process.\nPart (b) [5%]\nWrite down an expression for the probability, β, that the mean, x , of any given sample of size n\nfrom an out-of-control process with mean output x = μ + kσ, will not fall outside the control\nlimits.\n\nProblem 3, cont'd.\nPart (c) [10%]\nDerive, in terms of n, f, and β, an expression for the average number of parts, P, that will be\nproduced after a mean shift occurs and before a sample falls outside the range (LCL, UCL).\nWe could use the expression that you have just derived to choose a value for n that minimizes P\nfor a given f (do not attempt to choose n now). Suggest one other consideration that would\nfeature in the selection of sample size and sample frequency.\n\nProblem 3, cont'd.\nPart (d) [10%]\nNow suppose that you are told that the quality loss function for the process is defined as follows:\nμ-Δμ\nμ+Δμ\nHere, c is the cost penalty associated with producing a part with a particular x. Write down an\nexpression for the expected cost penalty Ek[c] for a part produced when the process output is\nx ~ N(μ + kσ, σ2). (Hint: your answer should be expressed as a sum of integrals; do not attempt to\nevaluate the integrals.)\n1⎛ x-μ ⎞\nNote: the probability density function of x ~ N(μ, σ2) is given by\ne\n-\n2⎝\n⎜σ ⎠\n⎟\n.\nσ 2π\nx\nc\ncq\nμ\nUSL:\nLSL:\nc = 0\n\nProblem 3, cont'd.\nPart (e) [7%]\nWith the above information in mind, you now want to investigate whether you should install\nmore metrology equipment so that the fraction of parts measured, f, can be increased. Suppose\nthat measurement costs can be completely described by an incremental cost cm per part\nmeasured.\nWrite down, and briefly explain, a cost expression that should be minimized when selecting an\noptimal value for f. Your answer should be given in terms of the following parameters:\nn\nsample size\ncm\ncost of measuring one part\nf\nfraction of all parts produced that are measured\nEk[c]\nexpected cost penalty for a part produced when the output is x ~ N(μ + kσ, σ2)\nE0[c]\nexpected cost penalty for a part produced when the output is x ~ N(μ, σ2)\nβ\nyour answer to part (b)\nd\nthe frequency (in parts-1), on average, with which the material supplier delivers a\ndefective batch of material (e.g. if d = 10-5 parts-1, the supplier would deliver a\ndefective batch for every 105 parts produced by the process.

While they are clearly related by a common source of plastic for\neach shot, it is most probable to expect that each cavity will have a unique distribution, if\nonly with respect to the mean value, and secondarily wrt the cavity variation. Even with\nthis flawed approach the two measurement approaches will give different results:\na) 1 will track time dependent changes well, since measurements will be ordered in\ntime. As soon as a change occurs, it will be reflected in the sample measurement.\n2 will track changes poorly, since the newest parts are mixed with old parts, so\nany change is diluted. Neither, of course, will track within cycle (cavity to cavity)\nchanges.\nb) By averaging over all cavities (method 1) or averaging across shots and cavities\n(method 2) we are going to compute Cp based on a single mean and variance.\nHowever, there are actually 4 means and 4 variances, or 4 non-coincident pdf's\ncontrolling this process. By using either measurement approach, we will get a\nvariance that is higher than any of the individual variances and a mean value that\nis not representative of any one cavity. As a result, we are likely to get a Cp and\nCpk that are larger that what the best cavity can produce. More importantly, we\nwill most likely underestimate the number of bad parts made this way, since the\nworst cavity will have a higher probability of producing out of spec parts that if\nthe process were truly from single pdf. .\nc) Although the average of the four cavities is a normally distributed random\nvariable, the samples are not taken from the same random variable, which is the\nunderlying assumption of xbar charts. Also, for method 1, the samples are not of\nindependent random variables, since the four parts from the same shot are very\nlikely to be related (correlated). For 2, the sampling strategy erases the time\nhistory of the process. For both, die position, which is an important assignable\ncause, has not been accounted for.\nd) Again, an assignable cause (location) has not been accounted for. In addition, the\nstandard deviation will not take into account any variation along the length of the\nsheet.\nA better method would be to chart each location separately, and take samples at\nfixed intervals along the length that are smaller than the size of any expected\ndisturbance. These samples would then be formed into sequential subgroups of n\nand charted.\nThe original method would be insensitive to changes at two locations that cancel\neach other out, and would underestimate the variation along the sheet. The\nproposed method would be less sensitive to small changes in the mean along the\nsheet.\n(An even better method would be to use multivariate analysis).\n\nProblem 2\na) Assuming a linear relationship between W1 W2 and W3, W2 is given by\nW\nW\nW\n+\n=\nAssuming that the diameters at W1 and W3 are independent, the expected mean\nand standard deviation of W2 are\n.0\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n.5\n=\n!\n\"\n#\n$\n%\n&\n+\n!\n\"\n#\n$\n%\n&\n=\n=\n+\n=\n'\n'\n'\nW\nW\nW\nb) First, define a new variable Δ=B-W2.

However, this means that if we have a sample size of n, the number of\npoints plotted on the chart is 1/n times the number of runs, thereby delaying or masking\nsome of the true process changes. One solution to this problem is to use a running\naverage of the data where a sample size of n is still used, but the running average of n\npoints is plotted, and updated as each new run data point is measured.\nAssume that a running average SPC chart is to be constructed with n=4. If we define the\nrun data as a sequence xi and that running average as the variable RAj:\na) Write an expression for calculating RAj recursively as each new xI is acquired.\nRA = 1\nn\nxi\ni = k!n\nk\n\"\nwhere k is the current time index\nRAj = RAj !1 + x j ! x j !n\nthat is we add the most recent data and take out the oldest, all the\nwhile keeping n=4 data points in the average\n, thus the recursive equivalent is:\nb) What is the expected distribution function p(RA) ? Please explain.\ncentral limit theorem) with\nSince the statistic is still the average of 4 run points at any given time, it will have the\nsame distribution as the xbar data for n=4, i.e. a normal distribution (owing to the\nμx = μ x and ! x = ! x\nn\nc) What are the control limits for the RA chart?\nSince the distribution is the same, and we have the same variances, the control limits will\nbe the same.\nd) If you were to plot both the Shewhart xbar data and RA for the same run data\non the same plot, what would it look like? Please provide a sketch of at least 12\nrun data points to illustrate your answer.\nThe first observation is that the Shewhart cart will only have data at every for run points,\nwhile an RA is calculated as each new data point is recorded. However, The value of RA\nat each 4th data point will be identical to the Shewhart value (i.e. the running average =\nthe sequential average each n data points)\nOn a chart this might look like:\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n10 11 12 13\nRA\nxbar\ne) Now consider a sudden change in the mean value of the process: i.e.. μ x=μ x+Δ..\nHow will the average run length (ARL) of the RA chart (and the subsequent\ntime to detect the mean shift) compare to that of the conventional xbar chart?\nThe average run length is simply an expression of probability of a control limit being\nexceeded. This probability is determined by the distribution of the variable being\nplotted. Since we have already said that RA and xbar have the same distribution :\nN(μx ,! x ) , then the probability of exceeding a control limit for a mean shift of Δ is the\nsame for RA or for xbar. The difference is that RA plot a new point at each run, so while\nARL may be the same for both, the time it takes for that run length is n time shorter for\nthe RA statistic."

However,\nthere are many situations where the process produces very few identical parts. One\nexample is a machining job shop where every part made could be different. Over all\nthese parts, the dimensions and material types can very widely\n\nIt has been proposed to measure each part and plot the error based on the target\ndimension instead of plotting the dimension itself. In this way a run chart can be created\nplotting error instead of the absolute dimension or its sequential average (xbar)\n\na) How would you create an xbar (in this case an (\"ebar\") chart for this data? What\nwould be the centerline and UCL LCL?\n\nThe target value for the error is 0, but we would still use the grand mean from\ninitial production runs. The UCL and LCL would be calculated using deviations of\nthe error from the grand mean. But the data used for these statistics would be\ncoming from many different parts instead of many similar ones.\n\nb) Why would this approach violate the basic assumptions of Shewhart?\n\nThe assumption is that all the data is coming from an identical probability\ndistribution with the same mean and variance. However, we know that as we\nchange machining conditions, as we change part dimensions, tool types and\nmaterial types, the mean of the process (or in this case the error of the process)\nwill vary. Thus we will not have a stationary process, and the chart will not be\nvalid.\n\nc) How will the chart vary from a \"proper\" Shewhart chart in both the limits and the\nappearance of the data on the chart?\n\nSince we have taken a grand mean for a non-stationary process, we will not only\nhave an incorrect mean for any given case, the variance will be greater than\nexpected for any given run. This is because we are modeling a variable mean\nprocess as one that is stationary. In doing so this moving mean will be reflected\nin an inflated estimate of the process variance. The data will tend to not fall into\nthe expected confidence intervals correctly and will appear more uniform than\nnormal, since the mean is actually shifting with each new part.\n\nd) What would a Cpk value for this process mean?\n\nCpk here would be difficult to assess since we would most likely have different\ntolerances for different parts, and as stated above a overall process variance that\n\nQuiz #1\nSolution\nMarch 14, 2007\n\nignores the variance on that a particular part. If we used a fixed tolerance it\ncould be a means of globally assessing performance of the equipment. But it\ncould not be used to predict the number of defective parts to be expected."

Statistical tables for the\ncumulative standard normal distribution, percentage points of the χ2 distribution, percentage\npoints of the t distribution, percentage points of the F distribution, and factors for constructing\nvariables for control charts (all from Montgomery, 5th Ed.) are provided.\nProblem 1 [35%]\nPart (a)* [10%]\nControl charts for x , R, and s are to be maintained for the threshold voltage of short-channel\nMOSFETs using sample sizes of n = 10. It is known that the process is normally distributed with\nμ = 0.75 V and σ = 0.10 V.

These samples gave a grand average of 0.734 V, and average si of 0.125 V, and\nan average Ri of 0.365 V.\n(1) x chart:\nThere are two approaches here; in one, we use R to estimate variance, and in the\nother we use s to estimate variance.

What\nis the Cp and Cpk for this process? Assuming the process as specified in part (a) is in control,\nwhat is the fraction of MOSFETs that are nonconforming? If the process in part (a) was\nrecentered such that μx is on target at 0.7 V, what would the fraction be of MOSFETs that are\nnonconforming?\nWe see that USL = 0.75 V and LSL = 0.65 V.\nUSL - LSL\n0.75 - 0.65\n(1) C p =\n=\n=\n= 0.167. Note that this is a very poor process capability\n6σ\n6 ⋅ 0.1\n(and we will see the impact on bad parts in a moment).\n(2) C pk = min⎛⎜USL -μ , μ - LSL ⎞⎟ = 0 since USL is equal to the actual process mean. This is\n⎝\n3σ\n3σ\n⎠\nlower than Cp since the process is not mean centered.\n(3) The process is horribly off-center, as noted in (2). All parts above the process mean are bad\n(above the USL), and an appreciably fraction of parts still fall below LSL because the\ndistribution is so wide compared to the specification limits. Thus\n⎡\n⎛USL -μ ⎞⎤ ⎡\n⎛μ - LSL ⎞⎤\nPr(nonconforming, off-center) = ⎢1-Φ⎜\n⎟⎥+ ⎢1- Φ⎜\n⎟⎥\n⎣\n⎝\nσ\n⎠⎦\n⎣\n⎝\nσ\n⎠⎦\n= ⎢\n⎡\n⎣\n1- Φ⎜⎛\n⎝\n0.75\n-\n.1\n0.75 ⎟⎞\n⎠⎥\n⎤\n⎦\n+ ⎢\n⎡\n⎣\n1- Φ⎜⎛\n⎝\n0.75\n-\n.1\n0.65 ⎟⎞\n⎠⎥\n⎤\n⎦\n= [1-Φ(0)] + [1-Φ(1)] = 0.659\n(4) Since the process was so badly off-mean, perhaps by recentering the process we can improve\nthe fraction of good parts. When centered\nPr(nonconf, centered) = 2⎢\n⎡1- Φ⎜⎛USL - T ⎟⎞\n⎥\n⎤ = 2⎢\n⎡1- Φ⎜⎛ 0.75 - 7 ⎟⎞\n⎥\n⎤ = 2[1-Φ(0.5)] = 0.617\n⎣\n⎝\nσ\n⎠⎦\n⎣\n⎝\n0.1\n⎠⎦\nSo we hardly reduce the fraction of bad parts at all? Why? Because the inherent process\ncapability is so poor (Cp = 0.167). The real problem is the distribution is too wide compared to\nthe specification limits, not that we are off-center.\n\nProblem 2 [30%]\nPart (a) [10%]\nBased on a fairly large historical sample of gate oxide thicknesses consisting of 61 samples, an\naverage oxide thickness of 96.5 A is observed, with a variance of 6 A2. What are your best\nestimates, and 95% confidence intervals, for the process mean and process variance?\n(1) Point estimate for mean: μˆ = x = 96.5 A\n(2) 95% confidence interval for mean.

Using the modified process, 11\nsamples are taken, with observed sample mean of 100 A and sample variance of 20 A2. What are\nyour best estimates, and 95% confidence intervals, for the new process mean and process\nvariance?\n(1) Point estimate for mean: μˆ = x = 100 A\n(2) 95% confidence interval for mean: Now we need to use the t distribution for sure, since n is\nsmall: μ = x ± tα / 2,n-1\ns = 96.5 ± 2.228 ⋅ 20 = 100 ± 3.00 A or 97 ≤μ ≤ 103 A\nn\n(3) Point estimate for variance: σˆ 2 = s 2 = 20 A2\n(4) 95% confidence interval for variance:\n(n -1)s 2\n≤σ 2 ≤ (n -1)s 2\nso that (10)20 ≤σ 2 ≤ (10)20 or 9.76 ≤σ 2 ≤ 61.6 A2\nΧα\n/ 2,n-1\nΧ1\n-α / 2,n-1\n20.48\n3.25\n\nPart (c) [10%]\nTo 95% confidence, has the modification resulted in a process with a different mean than in\npart (a)? To 95% confidence, has the modification resulted in a process with a different variance\nthan in part (b)?\n(1) No - because the 95% confidence intervals for the old and new means overlap, we don't\nhave enough evidence to be 95% confident or better that the means are different.\nOne can also attempt a direct hypothesis test on the difference in means. This is more\nwork than needed, given we already determined confidence intervals. However, if a\nhypothesis test is used, we should be careful not to assume the variances are the same (we\nhave strong evidence they are not), and so we would then need to use the somewhat\ncomplicated procedure described in Montgomery, pp. 120-121.\n(2) Yes - here the 95% confidence intervals for the new variance and old do not overlap. We\nare 95% confident or better that the chance has resulted in a process with larger variance.\nHere also, one can formulate a hypothesis test as an alternative approach. Given that one\nvariance appears to be so much larger than the other, we're best off using a one sided F-\ntest (that is to say, the one sided test will require even larger ratio to declare a larger\nvariance, and thus the one sided test is more conservative). So in this case, we would\nneed to observe an F > F0 , where F0 = F0.05,n -1,n -1 = F0.05,10,60 = 1.99 . In our case, we\nb\na\nobserve F = sb\n= 20 = 3.33 giving us better than 95% confidence that the second\ns\na\nvariance is larger than the first.\nProblem 3 [35%]\nYou are in charge of a process manufacturing parts whose key output parameter, x, is known to\nbe normally distributed. When the process is in control, the mean value of x is known to be μ and\nits standard deviation σ.\nUnfortunately, the supplier of an important input material for this process is rather unreliable,\nand every so often they inadvertently supply a large batch of material whose properties cause the\nmean of x to shift to μ + kσ, with the standard deviation of x remaining unchanged.\nWhen this mean shift occurs, you want to be able to identify it as quickly as possible. Your\nmetrology staff tells you that they can currently measure at most a fraction f of parts produced,\nalthough you are free to choose how this measurement budget is apportioned: i.e. you can dictate\nany n, where samples of n parts are taken at intervals of n/f parts.\n\nPart (a) [3%]\nWrite down, in terms of μ, σ and n, expressions for the upper and lower control limits for an\nx control chart monitoring this process.\nAnswer: μ ± 3σ/(n0.5)\nPart (b) [5%]\nWrite down an expression for the probability, β, that the mean, x , of any given sample of size n\nfrom an out-of-control process with mean output x = μ + kσ, will not fall outside the control\nlimits.\nAnswer: β = Φ(3 - k n )-Φ(- 3 - k n )\nPart (c) [10%]\nDerive, in terms of n, f, and β, an expression for the average number of parts, P, that will be\nproduced after a mean shift occurs and before a sample falls outside the range (LCL, UCL).\nAnswer: P = n/[f(1-β)]\nWe could use the expression that you have just derived to choose a value for n that minimizes P\nfor a given f (do not attempt to choose n now). Suggest one other consideration that would\nfeature in the selection of sample size and sample frequency.\nAnswer: The need to make the inter-sample interval longer than the correlation time of the\noutput, so that samples are plausibly independent.\n\nProblem 3, cont'd.\nPart (d) [10%]\nNow suppose that you are told that the quality loss function for the process is defined as follows:\nμ-Δμ\nμ+Δμ\nHere, c is the cost penalty associated with producing a part with a particular x. Write down an\nexpression for the expected cost penalty Ek[c] for a part produced when the process is\nx ~ N(μ + kσ, σ2).

Hopefully, not much of the\nbatch will be used before the problem is noticed!\nAnswer: Cost expression: fcm +(Ek [c] - E0[c]) f (1\nnd\n-β)\nWe need to minimize the sum of measurement costs and the extra quality-related cost penalty\nthat occurs when processing with defective material. The more frequently the suppliers deliver\nthe defective material, or the lower the measurement cost per part, the larger the optimal f.\nWhat other factors should be considered when choosing f?\nAnswer: The defective material input may not be the only cause of mean shifts that need to be\ndetected. We may also need to choose f to allow us to detect particular standard deviation\nchanges. Increasing f may slow down the production line, even if more measurement equipment\nwere to be installed: the metrology team may have other constraints."

Hardt* and Tsz-Sin-Siu*\nAbstract-- Most manufacturing processes produce parts\nthat can only be correctly measured after the process cycle has\nbeen completed. Even if in-process measurement and control\nis possible, it is often too expensive or complex to practically\nimplement. In this paper, a simple control scheme based on\noutput measurement and input change after each processing\ncycle is proposed. It is shown to reduce the process dynamics\nto a simple gain with a delay, and reduce the control problem\nto a SISO discrete time problem. The goal of the controller is\nto both reduce mean output errors and reduce their variance.\nIn so doing the process capability (e.g. Cpk) can be increased\nwithout additional investment in control hardware or in-\nprocess sensors. This control system is analyzed for two types\nof disturbance processes: independent (uncorrelated) and de\npendent (correlated). For the former the closed-loop control\nincreased the output variance, whereas for the latter it can\ndecrease it significantly. In both cases, proper controller de\nsign can reduce the mean error to zero without introducing\npoor transient performance.\nThese finding were demon\nstrated by implementing Cycle to Cycle (CtC) control on a\nsimple bending process (uncorrelated disturbance) and on an\ninjection molding process (correlated disturbance). The re\nsults followed closely those predicted by the analysis.\nIndex Terms-- Manufacturing Process Control, SPC, Dis\ncrete System Control, Variance Reduction\nI. INTRODUCTION\nM\nANUFACTURING processes can be controlled in a\nnumber of different ways, ranging from highly so\nphisticated, high bandwidth machine and process control\nsystems, to rather passive process monitoring. What distin\nguishes \"process control\" from automation or machine con\ntrol is the inclusion of the actual material modification step\nin the control loop. Also of critical importance is the fre\nquency of control. To achieve high frequency control in\ncluding the process usually involves difficult sensing and\nprocess modeling (see Hardt [1]). As a result the vast ma\njority of process control in the discrete parts industry falls\ninto two distinct categories\n* Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, Cambridge MA\n** Formerly Department of Mechanical Engineering, now with Ap\nplied Materials Corporation, Santa Clara, CA.\n-\nHigh bandwidth control of machine state variables such\nas displacement, force, pressure or temperature. (ma\nchine state control)\n-\nOutput sampling with process diagnostics based on\nmeasured process statistics. Statistical Process Control\n(SPC)\nExamples of intermediate levels of control such as\nmaterial state control (e.g. direct feedback of material\nstress, strain or temperature) are very unusual. Even less\ncommon are examples of direct process output feedback,\nsuch as in-process part geometry feedback.\nA simple block diagram of a process (see Fig. 1) em\nphasizes these distinctions. It also shows clearly that any\ncontrol other than output feedback neglects the influence of\nubiquitous process disturbances.\nThe most common of\nthese is the high likelihood of material property variations.\nEQUIPMENT\nMATERIAL\nCONTR.\nEquipment loop\nMaterial loop\nProcess output loop\nFigure 1 Three Levels of Feedback Process Control\nThe obvious reason for this dilemma is the cost and\ndifficulty of making in-process measurements on a material.\nEven in the presence of such measurements, the resulting\ncontrol system design requires a model of a process that is\nhighly non-linear, and changing rapidly as new workpieces\nare introduced.\nAs a result we see a large gap between the high band\nwidth, highly response methods that do not actually control\nthe process output, and the very low bandwidth methods of\nstatistical process control (SPC).\nThis paper addresses this problem by conceding that\noutput measurements can only be made after the process\ncycle is complete. While this immediately limits the band\nwidth and variance reduction performance of the system, it\nmakes it a nearly universally applicable approach. This\nperformance - applicability tradeoff is examined for two\ncases: a process contaminated with normally distributed\nidentically distributed independent noise (or uncorrelated\nnoise) and a similar noise process with some degree of cor\nrelation. It is examined both analytically and with experi\n\nments. The latter involved processes with uncorrelated and\nwith correlated noise.\nII. BACKGROUND\nOne of the earliest attempts to provide a formal intro\nduction to discrete feedback control in manufacturing was\nby Box and Kramer [2]. They argued that statistical proc\ness control and automatic process control are similar in na\nture but originate from different industries. SPC is devel\noped for the \"parts\" industry, while APC is designed for the\n\"process\" industry. The two industries have different goals.\nThe parts industry wants to achieve the smallest possible\nvariation while the process industry wants the highest yield.\nDifferent disturbances are associated with the two indus\ntries. The parts industry has small variations in material\nproperties while the process industry has higher sensitivity\nto external disturbances such as temperature and pressure.\nAlso, the cost of adjustment is high for the parts industry\nrelative to the process industry. The authors then point out\nthat the dividing line between the two industries is fading.\nBased on some of the arguments and theories developed\nby Box and Kramer, Sachs et al. [3] presented one of the\nfirst applications of discrete feedback control to manufac\nturing process. A real-time run-by-run (RbR) controller is\nimplemented for a silicon epitaxy process to reduce vari\nability. Three modes of operations are used to accommo\ndate the common types of disturbances:\n-\nOptimization mode using sequential design of experi\nments to locally optimize the process\n-\nRapid mode to quickly adjust the input to correct for\nlarge step disturbances (>2μ)\n-\nGradual mode to slowly adjust for slow drift distur\nbances (1μ /100 runs)\nAn EWMA filter is used to estimate the intercept of the\nlinear model of the process Experiments are performed on\nan Epitaxy Reactor and they show a 2.7 times improvement\nin the process capability, Cpk, in the gradual mode. The re\nsults also show the ability to reject step disturbances\nquickly in the rapid mode.\nThe authors also discuss the effect on the output if a\nmore realistic probabilistic model is used:\nYt =α + β ⋅ xt +κ ⋅σ ⋅ t + et\nwhere κ ⋅σ ⋅ t represents a drift (ramp) disturbance, κ\ndetermines the slope of the ramp disturbance and et is a\nwhite noise sequence with mean of zero and standard de\nviation of σ. The result of statistical analysis shows that the\nasymptotic mean squared deviation (MSD), which is the\nexpected value of the squared of the difference between the\nouput Y× and the target T, has the following expression:\nMSD =\n2b / β\n+ ⎛κb / β⎞\n(1)\nσ 2\n2b / β - w\n⎝ w ⎠\nThe ratio is always greater than zero, which indicates\nthat the MSD is greater than σ. One limiting case of the\nequation is when κ=0 and b=β. Equation (1) becomes 2/(2\nw), which is minimized at w=0. As a result, if the process\nhas no ramp disturbance component, it is best to simply\nleave the process alone in open loop (with system gain, w/b,\nequal to zero).\nVander Wiel and Tucker [4] apply the concept of CTC\nfeedback control to a manufacturing process. It is based on\nexperiments of controlling intrinsic viscosity from a par\nticular General Electric polymerization process. It reiterates\nmany of the equations and concepts proposed by Box and\nKramer [2]. The main contribution of this paper to the field\nis the four-step application guideline that the authors pro\nposed:\n-\nDevelop a time series transfer-function model of the\nprocess, including process dynamics caused by meas\nurement delays.\n-\nDesign a suitable controller based on the model of the\nprocess.\n-\nPut in SPC charts to monitor the closed-loop process to\ndetect any unexpected events happening.\n-\nIf an SPC alarm signals, search for assignable causes\nand remove it if possible.\nSmith and Boning [5] present an extension to the Expo\nnentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) controller to\ndynamically update the EWMA weights via an Artificial\nNeural Network to provide better control. The effects of\nEWMA weights on the responses of systems with different\ndisturbances are discussed, and the determination of opti\nmal EWMA weights using disturbance state mapping is\nalso presented.\nThe authors believe that the performance of a regular\nEWMA controller is highly dependent on the choice of the\nEWMA weights, and the ability to dynamically update the\nEWMA weight value is important for systems in which the\nprocess model does not accurately represent the true proc\ness dynamics. Simulation results show an improvement\nranging from 9% in small drift and high noise processes to\n38.7% in high drift and low noise processes.\nDel Castillo and Hurwitz [6] discuss the concepts be\nhind RbR control with particular emphasis on EWMA\nbased controllers. The authors point out that this type of\ncontroller is well suited for processes where the cost of an\noutput being off-target is high and where the cost of control\naction is relatively inexpensive. They also believe that the\nrun-by-run control techniques are well suited for short-run\ndiscrete part manufacturing processes.\nLimitations of these controllers include lagged response\nand sluggish performance. A self-tuning (ST) controller is\npresented to rectify some of these problems by separating\nthe estimation problem from the control problem. The type\nof controller discussed is called \"indirect ST\" controller\nwhere the control equation is derived and then parameter\nestimates are substituted for the true values. Simulation\nresults are presented and they shows that the ST controller\ncould provide more robust control against a wider variety of\ndistributions and system configurations than could certain\nEWMA controllers found in the literature.\n\nDel Castillo [7] presents a self-tuning multiple-input\nmultiple-output controller for run-by-run control. A sensi\ntivity analysis is presented to show the performance of the\ncontroller under various simulated system noise combina\ntions.\nValjavec and Hardt [8] is one of few research works re\nlated to CtC feedback control that are not in the process\nindustry. It provides validation that CtC control can be ap\nplied effectively to discrete parts manufacturing processes.\nThe authors develops a self-tuning feedback shape control\nalgorithm for stretch forming on a reconfigurable forming\ntool. Based on empirical estimation results of process pa\nrameters from calibration trials, a system identification\nstrategy called the deformation transfer function is used to\nrecursively estimate the tool shape required to achieve de\nsired part shape. Stability is achieved for the control strat\negy on laboratory and full-scale experiments.\nIn addition, the same control methodology is used to\ncompensate for the combined shape distortions in a series\nof manufacturing operations (stretch forming, chemical\nmilling and trimming).\nIII. PROCESS MODEL FOR CYCLE TO CYCLE CONTROL\nThe consequence of sampling the output only after\ncompletion of the process leads to a very simple process\nmodel. If we assume that a typical discrete part manufac\nturing process starts with a new workpiece and then applies\ndirected energy on the workpiece during the cycle to Tc,\nthen by definition the process transients are over by the end\nof the cycle and no more change in the workpiece occurs.\nThis allows the process to be modeled as a simple gain re\nlating one or more inputs to the measured output. However,\nsince we apply this control input at the start of the cycle and\nmust wait the full cycle to measure the product, there is also\na delay of at least one Tc. Any further delays will be attrib\nuted to measurement or the controller itself.\nThus the process model becomes:\nyk = K puk -1\n(2)\nwhere yk is the current process output and uk-1 is the control\ninput at the prior cycle. Thus the process has no apparent\ndynamics (other than the delay) when viewed after each\ncycle.\nThe essential control problem then arises from the fact\nthat this process gain in fact is stochastic, owing primarily\nto material variation from workpiece to workpiece. It can\nalso depend upon random variations in processing machine\noperation. Deterministic changes can also occur as material\nor machine changeovers occur.\nAccordingly, this model must be augmented to include\nthis random component. However, owing to the difficulty\nof analyzing closed-loop systems with variable gains, espe\ncially if they are stochastic, we instead model this effect as\nadditive noise. Thus the process model becomes:\nyk = K puk -1 + dk\n(3)\nwhere d is a noise sequence that is either correlated or un\ncorrelated in time.\nIf we transform this system using the Z-transform, Eqn\n4 becomes\nY (z) = K pz\n-1U (z) + D(z)\n(4)\nIV. MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE\nBefore proceeding to controller design, it is important to\nset the expectations of this system.\nFor manufacturing\nprocesses controlled at this level of granularity, there are\nsome well-established measures of performance based on a\nstatistical model of the process. The most common is the\nprocess capability, which measures the variation of the\nprocess relative to the design specifications. In particular\nthe metric\n⎛ T\n+ -μ μ -T\n-⎞\nC pk = min⎝⎜ 3σ\n,\n3σ\n⎠⎟\nmeasures the deviation of the mean value (μ) of the process\nfrom the upper or lower tolerance limits T+ and T-, normal\nized by the variance of the process (3σ). (See Devor et al\n[9], e.g.)\nThus we can measure the performance of our\nCtC control system on the basis of the distance of the mean\nor steady-state output from the target value (T) and the\nprocess variance σ.\nIt is also possible to use Taguchi's Quality Loss Func\ntion (Devor et. al. [9]) to derive an expected cost of poor\nperformance:\nE[ L] = Var[ x] + {E[ x] - T }\n= σ x\n2 + (μ -T )\nwhere L is the quality loss (usually expressed in cost fig\nures). Here again it is clear that the objective is to mini\nmize variance and mean distance from the target.\nIn\nSiu[10] this cost function is used to develop an optimal CtC\ncontrol scheme that minimizes this expected loss.\nV. CYCLE TO CYCLE CONTROLLER ANALYSIS\nWith the above process model (Eqn 4) we can proceed\nto design various cycle to cycle (CtC) controllers. It is then\npossible to assess the effect on steady-state error and noise\nvariance reduction for each case.\nIn all cases the control system will have the form shown\nin Fig. 2.\n\nD(z)\nGc(z)\nz-1 Kp\nY(z)\nR(z)\nFig. 2 Basic CtC Control Loop\nThe controller Gc (z) will (at this time) be one of two\nchoices:\nProportional\nGc (z) = Kc\nIntegral\nGc (z) = Kc z/(z-1)\nA. Stability and Characteristic Response\nThe plant model\nGp (z ) = z\n-1K p\n(5)\nis the same for all processes we expect to consider, the plant\nreduces to a simple pole at the origin. With proportional\ncontrol, then, we can show that the stable range of loop\ngains is given by 0 ≤ KcK p ≤ 1. In addtiion, the expected\nresponse will be oscillatory for all stable gain as the closed-\nloop root is on the negative real axis of the z-plane.\nThe integral controller adds a pole at +1 and cancels the\nplant pole with a zero at the origin. In this case, the stable\nrange is extended to 0 ≤ KcK p ≤ 2 and for 0 ≤ KcK p ≤ 1\nthe response will be non-oscillatory with a settling time that\ndecreases as KcK p → 1., which corresponds to the closed-\nloop root approaching the origin of the z-plane.\nB. Steady- State Error\nRecalling the performance measures defined above, the\nability of the CtC system to minimize the target dimension\nT and the process mean μ is critical. For a stationary dis\nturbance modeled as a normal process with constant mean\nand constant variance, this error can be characterized by the\nsteady-state step input and step disturbance error for the\nclosed-loop system.\nFor the proportional control there will be a finite step\ninput and step disturbance error given by\n=\n(6)\nss step\n1+ K K\ne\nc\np\nSince stability limits KcK p ≤ 1 we can expect large er\nrors for this controller.\nThe integral controller will of course have zero steady-\nstate error to both step inputs or disturbances regardless of\nthe loop gain.\nC. Variance Reduction\nThe above are simple classical results that suggest supe\nrior performance of the integral controller. Of greater con\ncern here, however, is the ability of the CtC control system\nto reduce the variance of the additive output disturbance.\nFor this analysis we must first more carefully consider our\ndisturbance model.\nAs previously discussed, two models are appropriate for\nmost manufacturing processes.\nFor processes with fast\nprocess dynamics, and with workpiece material changing\non each cycle, the events in a disturbance sequence must be\nindependent. For processes with slower dynamics (primar\nily thermal dynamics) there may be some dependence from\ncycle to cycle.\nThe uncorrelated noise is simply modeled as a normal\nidentically distributed independent (NIDI) process (or a\ngaussian white noise process) with mean of μ and variance\nσ2 . To simulate a dependent or correlated disturbance, this\nwhite noise is \"colored\" with a simple first order filter:\n1 - p\nG f (z ) = z - p\nwhere p =0.8 is chosen for all simulations herein.\n1) Variance ratio: White noise, Proportional Control\nIn this case, since each new noise sample is independent\nof the last, and since the process has at least one time step\ndelay, we expect to see the variance ratio start at 1 and in\ncrease with gain.\nAn analysis of this problem is found in Siu[10], who\nconsiders not only the steady state variance ratio, but the n\nresult as well. From that analysis it can be shown that the\nvariance:\nσ\n1- K\n2n\ny n\n(7)\n=\nσ 2\n1- K 2\nwhere\nσ y\n2= process output variance at time step n\nn\nσ2 = noise variance\nK\n= loop gain (KcKp)\nFrom this equation it is apparent that for any value of K\nthe variance of the disturbance will be amplified, as shown\nin Fig. 3\n\nVariance ratio\nController Gain, Kc\nController Gain, Kc\nVariance ratio\nFrequency Analysis\n3) Variance ratio: Uncorrelated Disturbances with In\n12.000\nAnalytical\nMatlab simulation\ntegral Control\nThe change to an integral controller has a marked effect\n10.000\non improving steady-state or mean error behavior, but it\nσy/σ\ncannot be expected to reduce variance in the uncorrelated\n8.000\n6.000\n4.000\n2.000\n0.000\n0.00\n0.20\n0.40\n0.60\n0.80\n1.00\nController Gain, Kc\nLoop Gain K\nFigure 3 Proportional Control Variance Ratio as n ->inf; Uncorre\nlated Disturbances\ndisturbance case any more than in the proportional case.\nHowever, since the range of stable gains is great, and tran\nsient behavior does improve with gain, it is important to\ndetermine the new variance ratio.

However, a\nsimulation of this situation was performed using MATLAB.\nIn this case the CtC system was run for ~5000 transients at\neach gain level and the average output variance calculated.\nThe result is shown in Fig. 4, and there is indeed a reduc\ntion in variance over the range K ∈0,0.8 . In fact, the in\ncrease in the variance ratio after K = 0.6 can be attributed to\nthe increasingly oscillatory response of the underlying sys\ntem, rather than to any steady state noise amplification.\n1.800\n1.600\n0.000\n0.500\n1.000\n1.500\n2.000\nLoop Gain K\nFigure. 5 Integral Control Variance Ratio as n ->inf; Uncorrelated\nDisturbances\nHere it is noteworthy that variance amplification is mi\nnor until K>1, implying a reasonable range of working\ngains for both transient response performance and variance\nreduction. However, as gains increase beyond that point,\nthe amplification becomes extreme.\nAlthough Eqn 8 indicates a time dependence for the\nvariance ratio, in fact the transients are over by n=6 for all\nranges of gain, and are of little significance here.\n4) Variance ratio: Correlated Disturbances with Inte\ngral Control\n1.400\n1.200\nσy/σ\nVariance ratio\nAgain the analysis of this situation is beyond the scope\n1.000\nof this paper, but Box and Luceno[11] have analyzed the\n0.800\ncase and show the expected variance reduction.

Variance Ratio for Correlated Disturbances ; Integral\nControl\nD. Summary of CtC Analysis\nIn this section we have defined a simple process and\ndisturbance model that captures the essential input-output\nproperties of myriad manufacturing processes when sam\npled cycle to cycle. From this model we define two classes\nof processes: those with uncorrelated disturbances and\nthose with correlated disturbances.\nIt is shown that vari\nance reduction for the former is not possible whereas for the\nlatter it is.\nIn addition, it is shown that an integral con\ntroller is superior to proportional control of the CtC control\nloop, primarily owing to its superior error performance.\nFrom this analysis we can also conclude that CtC con\ntrol, using an integral control law and an appropriately cho\nsen loop gain, can center a process on the target value,\nthereby eliminating mean errors. For a process with uncor\nrelated disturbances, this centering is done at the cost of a\nslight increase in variance. However, for processes with\nsome correlation in the disturbance, the mean error can be\neliminated and variance reduction of up to 50% can be re\nalized.\nIn either case it is important to realize that process ca\npability (Cpk) can be increased for processes subject to sig\nnificant mean drift or shifts, even if they have uncorrelated\nrandom disturbance components.\nThese results are obvious once the model is developed\nand the problem posed. However, it remains to examine\nboth the validity of the model and the resulting closed-loop\nsystem performance. This is presented in a pair of experi\nments designed to look at the two classes of processes: un\ncorrelated and correlated.\nVI. EXPERIMENTS\nTo test the results of Section V a series of experiments\nwere performed to implement CtC control. Two processes\nwere chosen to examine different types of process physics\nand disturbances.\nA. Uncorrelated Disturbance Process: Sheet Metal\nBending\nThe simple process of bending is commonly used for\nmany simple sheet metal products. It is well known to be\nsensitive to material property variations, and is easily im\nplemented in a lab setting. For the tests presented here, a\nsimple lab scale 3-point bending apparatus was used, as\nshown in Fig. 7. The tools are mounted in a simple engine\nlathe, and the punch is manually moved into the material.\nThe key input is the displacement of the punch Yp into the\nmaterial and the output is the included angle of the resulting\npart. The input was measured by the vernier on the tail-\nstock of the lathe (with a resolution of 0.001 in.), while the\nangle is measured with a machinist protractor (with a reso\nlution of 5 minutes.)\nWorkpiece\nPunch\nDie\nYp\nFigure 7: Setup for Bending Experiments\n1) Process Gain\nThe basic process model is a gain relating the punch po\nsition to the output angle. This gain was determined with a\nseries of open-loop experiments on three materials:\n-\n0.025in thickness steel\n-\n0.020in thickness steel\n-\n0.032in thickness aluminum\nThese choices allow introduction of different yield\nstresses, elastic moduli and thicknesses, all of which\nstrongly affect the resulting process gain.\nAlthough the process is known to be non-linear, the\nmodel was developed using tests in a small range of output\nangles so an equivalent linear gain could be determined. A\ntypical result is shown in Fig. 8\n\nAngle\ny = 151.9x - 156.96\nR2 = 1\n1.1\n1.15\n1.2\n1.25\n1.3\n1.35\n1.4\nPunch depth\nFigure 8.

This represents the\none time step delay of the system; the control action is a\nnew punch penetration for the next forming cycle,\nTo assess the disturbance variance, it was first necessary\nto perform a number of open-loop runs using fixed punch\ndepths. This was done for each material with 20-30 runs\nfor each test. From these runs it was determined that the\nopen-loop variance was dependent on both material and\npunch depth. Typical results are shown in Table 2 (The\nbasic measurement repeatability was found to be 0.1°.)\nMaterial\nStandard Deviation\n0.02 Steel\n0.161°\n0.025 Steel\n0.200°·\n0.32 Aluminum\n0.368°\nTable 2: Typical Standard Deviation based on 15-30 Open-Loop\nTests\nA typical experiment implementing closed-loop control\nis shown in Fig. 9. Here the process is run open-loop for\nmany cycles, then CtC proportional control with K=0.7 is\nimplemented. As expected, the press variance goes up visi\nbly, but the process moves closer to the desired mean value\nof 35 (although it was at 35.14 open-loop; not a great dis\ntance).\n36.5\n35.5\n34.5\n33.5\nRun number\nOpen-loop\nClosed-loop\nFigure 9 Proportional CtC Control of Bending.

This change in\nthickness will cause a 7.65° shift for a fixed punch dis\nplacement.

When done at a\nrate of 1.51°/cycle, it produced divergent results of the P\ncontrol (as expected) whereas the I controller settled to a\n\nfinite error of 3°, exactly as would be predicted for a loop\ngain of 0.5.\n4) Conclusions: Bending Experiments\nThe experiments with bending have shown close con\nformance to the predictions for a process with uncorrelated\ndisturbances.

Correlated Noise: Injection Molding\nFor the second experiment, injection molding was cho\nsen for several reasons. First, it is a process dominated by\nthermal time constants, and can be expected to display\nsome correlation between cycles. It is also a far more com\nplex \"parallel\" process that stands at the opposite spectrum\nin process type from bending. Finally, it typically produces\ncomplex parts with one or more critical dimension, and has\nsome well identified input variables.\nThe part formed was a simple cylinder of ABS and the\nouter diameter was chosen as the output. (See Fig. 11)\nFigure 11 ABS Cylinder Part Forming Using Injection Molding\nIn contrast to bending, the first problem with injection\nmolding is determining which input to use for the experi\nments. The candidates include injection nozzle tempera\nture, hold time (after injection and packing) and injection\nspeed. A 32 experiment was designed to determine which\nof these was most sensitive and it was found that hold time\nwas the best input for these test.\n1) Process Gain Determinations\nAgain a series of open-loop experiments were per\nformed to determine the process gain relating output dimen\nsions (in) to input hold time (sec). Hold time could be re\nsolved to 0.01 sec on the machine controller and the vernier\ncaliper used to measure the parts had a resolution of 0.0005\nin.\nFrom a series of 24 open-loop tests all run after the\nprocess had reached thermal equilibrium, the process gain\nwas found to be -1.39 x 10-4. This means that for the full\nrange of hold times (0-30 sec) we expect only a 0.004in\nchange in part dimension. This is to be expected, however,\nsince the main determinant of part dimension is the tool\nitself, and this experiment is aimed a making small correc\ntions to the basic output dimension.\n2) CtC Experiments\nAs before, the open-loop variance was first character\nized and then used as a baseline for gauging controller vari\nance reduction. Both P and I controllers were again used,\nand part dimension feedback was done after each forming\ncycle. However, owing to the long cooling time of the\nparts, they were measured \"hot\" out of the mold. The\nchange in dimension was found to be deterministic and\nproduced a fixed offset that did not influence the variance\nof the final products.\nFor the P controller, we expect a reduction in variance,\nprovided the process has some correlation in the distur\nbances. In fact, a typical closed-loop run (see fig. 12)\nshows clearly both the variance reduction and error reduc\ntion properties of the controller.\n1.446\n1.444\n1.442\n1.44\n1.438\n1.436\n1.434\n1.432\n1.43\nOpen Loop\nClosed Loop\nRun\nFigure 12 CtC Controller Effect for Injection Molding (P control\nK = 0.5)\nOver a range of reasonable gains for the P controller it\nwas found that the variance ratio was always less than one.\nFor example, when K = 0.2 the variance ratio was 0.74 and\nwhen increased to 0.5 it decreased to 0.39. This result fol\nlows closely that shown in Fig. 3 (value of 0.7 and 0.5).\nThese results indicate a significant degree of correlation in\n\nthe disturbance, with the resulting variance reduction using\nCtC control.\nLikewise with the I controller a similar variance reduc\ntion was found (e.g. for K=0.2 the variance ratio was 0.4\nversus a predicted value of 0.6 from Fig. 4). The error\nproperties of the in controller were harder to assess for this\nprocess owing the limited process latitude, and during most\nstep disturbance experiments, the process saturated at the\n0.004in change limit, precluding further improvement using\nhold time as the input.\n3) Process Correlation\nSince distinct variance reduction was observed for the\ninjection molding process the CtC control analysis suggests\nthat the process disturbances must be correlated, that is\nshowing some state dependence from cycle to cycle. To\ntest this finding, the Autocorrelation for the process output\nwhen run open-loop was determined. For comparison, the\nautocorrelation for the bending case was auto calculated.\nThese results are shown in Fig. 13. From these results it\nappears that there is strong correlation in the 1-5 cycle time\nrange for injection molding, but no real evidence of any\ncorrelation in the bending case. This is of course consistent\nwith the variance increase noted in the CtC control for\nbending.\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n-0.1\n-0.2\na) Injection Molding\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\nb) Air bending process\nFigure 13 Autocorrelation comparison between open-loop process\n(left), Process (right)\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nThe concept of Cycle to Cycle Control has been intro\nduced as a simple means of improving process capability\nusing linear discrete time control theory. A simple process\nmodel results from assuming that data and control actions\ncan only be taken after the process cycle is complete. Sta\nbility limits for the system can be quickly established, and\nmean error and variance reduction relationships developed.\nThe key observations are:\nRegardless of the nature of the output randomness, the\nmean error can be reduced, producing a more closely cen\ntered process. The variance of the process is either slightly\nincreased (for uncorrelated disturbances) or decreased by a\nsignificant amount (correlated disturbances) by the CtC\ncontrol. For both cases the process capability can be im\nproved over the open loop (typical of SPC) case.\nThese results were born out by using CtC on bending\nand injection molding processes. Not examined here, but\ndetailed by Siu [10] is the ability to determine an optimal\ngain based on minimizing quality loss.\nHowever, CtC does require knowledge of the often\nhighly variable process gain, and adaptive methods for in-\nprocess determination of this quantity should be explored.\nAlso, there are often many coupled output dimensions in a\ntypical product, so multi-variable extension of CtC control\nwould be of great value.\nVIII.

Hardt\nLaboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nFebruary , 1996\nThe following paper outlines a basic modeling paradigm for\nmanufacturing process control. Once the model is defined, three\ndistinctly different modes of process control are described based on\nthis model The model then leads to a control taxonomy for\nmanufacturing processes.\nModel Definition\nAll manufacturing processes have but two outputs:\n- Geometry\n(macroscopic shape of the product)\n- Properties\n(all intrinsic material properties)\nThese two outputs completely define the performance of the product,\nand the design specifications that it must meet.\nAll processes also involve the transformation of material from an\ninitial geometry and set of properties to the final outputs. This\ntransformation is accomplished through the application (or removal)\nof energy, distributed about the surface or volume of the material.\nThe source of this \"directed energy\" is the manufacturing machine or\nequipment. Thus, we can first define a manufacturing process as the\ninteraction of equipment with a material to transform the material to\nthe desired outputs geometry and properties. This model is shown in\nblock diagram form in Fig 1.\nOutputs\nEnergy\nGeometry\nProperties\nEquipment\nMaterial\nFig. 1 The Relationship of Equipment and Material in a\nManufacturing Process\nSince all transformations are driven by and governed by the\nequipment, the only control over the process (other than changing the\nmaterial itself) is through the equipment. Thus, the control inputs to\nthe process are those equipment inputs that modulate the intensity\nand distribution of the energy input to the material. In other words,\nduring the operation of the process, the only accessible means of\ncontrolled change is the equipment inputs. This leads to the process\nmodel shown in Fig. 2\nEnergy\nEquipment\nMaterial\nMachine\nInputs\nOutputs\nGeometry\nProperties\nFig. 2 Process Model with Equipment Inputs Shown\nTo help define internal variables in the process as well as the inputs\nand outputs, the basic output causality of the process model is shown\nin Fig. 3 using a simple functional relationship between the process\noutput vector Y and the parameters of the process .\nY = ()\nThe equipment inputs u are separated as a subset of the parameters\nthat are accessible, certain and \"manipulable\" in a \"reasonable\" time\nframe relative to the basic process execution time.\nY = (,u)\nThe vector can be further broken down into two categories:\n- Material Parameters\n- Equipment Parameters\nWithin both equipment and material parameters, we are interested in\nthe thermodynamic state and the constitutive properties of each. For\nexample, the equipment states will be the power pairs: force-velocity,\npressure-flow, temperature- entropy (or heat flow) voltage-current,\nand chemical potential-extent of reaction. Material states can be the\nsame quantities within the material. By contrast, the equipment\nproperties govern how and when the energy is applied. Thus, the\ngeometric, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the\nequipment determine its constitutive properties. Constitutive\nproperties for the material are the well-known quantities such as\nstiffness, yield point, melting point, viscosity, etc.\nFig. 3 Development of A Process Model for Control\nY =\nprocess outputs = process parameters\n= the\nprocess transformation function.\nThe parameter\nvector is progressively broken down into distur\nbances () and inputs (u)\nDavid E. Hardt 1/31/05\n\nIn general, the states of the equipment and material change over the\ncourse of the process as energy is applied, whereas the constitutive\nproperties tend to remain unchanged. However, the energy focused\non the material often causes significant changes in the constitutive\nproperties. Indeed the process outputs as defined above can be\nthought of as the terminal mechanical states and constitutive\nproperties for the material.\nModes of Process Control\nThere are several ways in which processes are controlled, ranging\nfrom off-line sensitivity reduction to real-time output control. In all\ncases, the objective is to minimize the effect of disturbances (i.e. )\non the output Y. This basic objective is captured by the first order\nvariation equation:\nY\nY\nY =\n+\nu\n\nu\nwhere:\nY = variation of the output\nY = disturbance sensitivity of the process\n= parameter disturbances\nY\nu = input-output sensitivity or \"gain\"\nu = equipment input changes\nTo minimize the basic variation of Y we can:\n- design and operate the process to have low disturbance sensitivities\n(minimize Y/). This is the goal of process optimization.\n- design or control the equipment to minimize parameter variations\nThis is the goal of Statistical Process Control (SPC)\n- counteract by appropriate changes in u, most typically through\nthe use of feedback control to minimize Y over an appropriate\nfrequency range\nSensitivity and Parameter Optimization\nOne means of characterizing the properties of a process is to quantify\nthe effect of variations in the parameters on the outputs. This\n\"generalized sensitivity function\" takes the matrix form:\nY\nIf such sensitivity functions are known, the process can then be tuned\nor \"optimized\" so as to minimize these functions. This control\nmethod is shown schematically in Fig. 4\nIn this control method the objective is to select nominal values of\nparameters such that the sensitivity of the output to disturbances\nY\nis minimized. (Note that no inherent feedback loop exist here; thus\nchanges in will not be directly compensated for.)\nFig. 4 Optimization of to minimize the effect of\nStatistical Process Control\nSPC is actually a process diagnosis tool that tries to determine if\nprocess disturbances () that are non-random in nature exist. This\nis done by examining the statistics of output data sampled from the\nprocess. If such disturbances are found, SPC provides no prescrip\ntion for action, but implies that the disturbance should be eliminated.\nThis is equivalent to detecting and eliminating (the disturbances)\nin the above variation equation. (This obviates taking any control\naction via u.)\nState Control using Feedback Systems\nSince it is parameter variations that are responsible for variations in\nthe process output, it is advantageous to try to reduce this variation.\nA common and very powerful method for reducing uncertainty is\nfeedback systems, based on direct measurement of the equipment or\nmaterial states. Examples of this include equipment force, velocity,\ntemperature, pressure, or flow control. It may also involve control of\nmaterial temperatures, pressures or displacements, for example. This\nmethod is shown in Fig.5\nFig. 5 Feedback Control of Process States.\nThere is an important distinction to be made between equipment state\nand material state control. In the former we have a much closer\ncoupling between the inputs (equipment inputs) and the controlled\nvariable (an equipment state). When the control is applied to the\nmaterial state, the equipment and all its static and dynamic properties\nare included in the control loop as well as the often uncertain energy\ninteraction \"port\"\nIn this method, we place certain parameters (a subset of the material\nstates) e of the system under feedback control to reduce their\nDavid E. Hardt 1/31/05\n\nvariation or to render their values more certain. Thus, the effect of\nparameter variations on the outputs:\nY e\ne\nis reduced by reducing e. Note that the outputs of the process and\nthe disturbance effect on these are still outside the control loop.\nProcess Output Feedback Control\nUltimately the only means of insuring proper output target values and\nminimizing variation is to use feedback control directly on the\noutputs. As shown in Fig. 6, this strategy automatically encompasses\nall influences on the processes, provided a true output measurement\nis available. In practice this is seldom the case and the measurement\nprocess itself can add time delays and errors to the process.\n(Note that we have added the measurement process as a separate\nproblem, and indeed this problem can dominate in output control\nproblems. )\nMANUFACTURING\nPROCESS\nCONTROLLER\nOUTPUTS (Y)\nDesired\nProcess\nOutputs\nPARAMETERS ()\nMATERIAL\nState and Properties\nMACHINE\nState and Properties\nDISTURBANCES ()\nMATERIAL\nMACHINE\nmeasured or estimated outputs\nFig. 6 Direct Feedback Control of Process Outputs\nFinally, it is clear that many specific factors in the process physics\nand processing equipment design affect the ability to implement each\nof these types of control. The problem is discussed in detail in Hardt\n[1991], but the following helps to overlay the above framework on\nthe universe of all manufacturing processes.\nA Taxonomy for Control of Manufacturing\nProcesses\nThe objective of process control is to force the process outputs of\ngeometry and properties to match certain target values, and to create\na \"responsive\" process. Ideally we would simply measure these\noutputs and adjust the appropriate controls, but most processes\nrequire a further breakdown of these objectives into control \"sub\nproblems\". To help define these sub problems, it is first necessary to\nclassify manufacturing processes in a manner that highlights the\ndominant control issues.\nFor example, both machining and closed-die forging have clear\ngeometry and property outputs, but what determines these outputs for\neach process is quite different. It is this difference that makes\nmachining an easy process to control in real-time and one that can\nrespond quickly to command or target changes, but also one with a\nrather slow production rate. On the other hand, the geometry output\nof closed-die forging is nearly impossible to change in-process since\ncomplete tooling redevelopment is required each time a new target\nshape is needed. However, forging is often an order of magnitude\nfaster in production rate than machining for parts of similar shape\ncomplexity.1\nWhy are these processes so vastly different in our control framework;\none easily controlled and made responsive, yet slow, while the other\nis total unresponsive within a part cycle framework, yet very fast?\nThe differences are many, and in fact the only similarity is that each\nuses mechanical energy on metals. For starters, machining induces\nshape change by removing material. Forging does so by deforming a\nfixed mass of material. Machining uses part -independent tooling\nthat applies the transformation energy to a local region, creating the\nshape by moving the tool along a specified trajectory. Forging uses a\npart specific, \"shaped tool\" that creates the part in a single\nunidirectional stroke of the forging press, applying mechanical\nenergy in a highly distributed fashion.\nThis simple example suggests at least one means of classifying\nprocesses for control; one that begins with the basic physical\nmechanisms of shape change, and then considers whether the change\noccurs locally or globally in time. Finally, to determine the physical\nprocesses that must be analyzed, modeled, measured and\nmanipulated, delineating the dominant energy domain of the material\ntransformation process will be necessary.\nProcess Classification for Control\nBased on this discussion, a rudimentary hierarchical system of\nclassification is suggested and is illustrated in Fig. 7\nTransformation Methods\nSerial Interaction\nParallel Interaction\nDominant Energy Domain\nDominant Energy Domain\nMechanical\nMechanical\nThermal\nThermal\nChemical\nChemical\nElectrical\nElectrical\nFig. 7 Hierarchy of Process Classification for Control\nAt the head of this hierarchy is the transformation process or the\nactual mechanism of shape change. Such methods include:\n- Material Removal\n- Material Addition\n- Plastic Deformation\n- Solidification\nIn each case a workpiece material is altered to create the desired\nshape, and within each category, all material types can be included,\nand different energy sources can be used. In addition, the\ntransformation energy can be either applied locally and moved in a\nserial manner to create or follow the part contour, or applied\neverywhere on the part in parallel. It is clear that the details of the\nphysical phenomena involved will depend upon the material type and\n1 One extreme example of this is the production of high performance landing\ngear for commercial aircraft. The part starts as an isothermal forging, which\nmight take a few hours to complete. However, once finished the part must be\nmachined, to refine the shape and improve dimensional accuracy, but this\nmachining can take over 200 hours!\nDavid E. Hardt 1/31/05\n\nthe energy source used for the transformation. This distinction is\nshown schematically in Fig. 8\nFor example, a metal can be cut by imposing large local shear forces,\ncausing the material to separate at the tool point. However, we can\nalso cut this material by moving a concentrated heat source along the\ndesired cut line. This heat can in turn come from a gas torch, a\nplasma arc or a laser beam. Concentrated shearing is also used to cut\nlarge parts from sheet, but rather than doing so at a point, or in a\nserial fashion, matched contoured cutting tools are used to cut (or\n\"stamp\") all portions of the part in parallel. While all of these\nprocesses are clearly \"removal\" processes, they differ significantly in\nthe other areas of the classification hierarchy, and these differences\nwill directly affect upon our ability to control them.\nv(t)\na) Serial Process (e.g. laser cutting)\ny(t)\nK(s)\nb)Parallel Process (e.g. sheet stamping)\nFig. 8 Classification of Manufacturing Processes\nNote that\nfor the serial process geometry is determined by the\ntime varying velocity vector while for the parallel\nprocess the curvature distribution K(s) is the primary\ndeterminant of geometry\nFinally, the dominant energy used in the transformation has\nsignificant impact on the speed and accuracy of the process. In\ngeneral mechanical and electrical processes are extremely fast and\nthese energy forms can be applied to very small or very large areas,\nwhereas thermal and chemical energy process are diffusive by nature\nand tend to have long time constants. Processes dominated by these\ndomains are typically rate limited by heat transfer or reaction rate\nlimits, and even if energy is locally applied it quickly diffuses into\nthe material (e.g. welding).\nAs a first attempt at applying such a classification scheme, many of\nthe common processes in use today are listed in Table 1 according to\nthis scheme.\nSerial and Parallel Processes\nAfter categorization by transformation method, the serial/parallel\ndistinction is perhaps the most important from the point of view of\ncontrol since it will have the greatest impact on the controllability\nand time frame of control. Serial processes are those that modify\ngeometry and properties by moving a local process along a prescribed\ntrajectory, making changes in sequence. These processes include\nmost machining, laser processing, welding, rolling and many\nassembly processes. The set of control problems in serial processes\nalways includes an equipment displacement or trajectory control\nproblem. Also, most robotic processes are by definition serial\nprocesses, and, although tooling is present, is it usually not specific to\nany one part.\nParallel processes are those that affect large regions of a workpiece\nsimultaneously. These processes include all that use shaped tooling\n(forming, forging, casting, molding, etching, ECM or EDM) and\nadditive processes such as powder based, spray or plating processes.\nIn most cases any \"trajectory\" that is involved is a simple single axis\nmovement and has little effect on part geometry. For parts with\nshaped tooling, the geometry is essentially completely determined by\nthis tooling, and seldom can it be changed in-process. As a result,\nthis type of process often has very long time constants for change.\nIn some cases there are boundary conditions such as global forces,\ntemperatures and pressures that can change the relationship between\nthe tooling shape and the final part shape, and while these can be\nchanged rapidly, their effect is still global in nature.\nAs for control, serial processes typically are more controllable,\nbecause local changes do not affect the global part, and changes in\ntime correspond to spatial changes over the extent of the part. Since\nall the \"action\" is easily located in the region of the local process,\nmeasurement is simplified, and models can be developed that are\nvalid locally without as much concern about the global accuracy.\nWith serial processes gross changes in geometry can be effected\nsimply by changing the trajectory and the process in concert. Little\nor no fixed tooling is used (except to fixture the parts prior to\nprocessing)\nParallel processes are not well modeled by conventional feedback\ncontrol methods, but some research has uncovered useful application\nof system theory to certain problems. In most cases, the only means\nof process control are statistical in nature and cannot exert significant\ncontrol authority. Such processes are typically quite inflexible, since\nthe time constant of change is very long compared to the part\nprocessing time\nIn most categories of material transformation methods, such as those\nlisted in Table 1, there are both serial and parallel processes. As will\nbe demonstrated in each of these categories, our ability to effect\ncontrol will vary in direct relation to whether the process is serial or\nparallel.\nOne of the best examples of how process design can be used to\nimprove control properties is the recently invented process of stereo\nlithography. (Kodama, 1981, Hull, 1986) This process (listed in\nTable 1 as a solidification/serial/thermal process) is in fact the serial\nversion of more conventional polymer molding processes. By\nselectively solidifying the material, the need to a model is eliminated,\nand the outer shell of the part as it is produced becomes the mold.\nThis eliminated fixed tooling, and converts the process control\nproblem into one of primarily trajectory control, since the local\npolymerization process is well behaved and can operate well in an\nopen-loop fashion. Other processes such as laser sintering (Deckard,\n1989) and 3-D printing (Sachs et al., 1990) are examples of taking\nparallel process physics and converting it to a serial process.\nSummary\nThis paper presents a simple model to help understand the universe of\nmanufacturing processes in the context of their control. By defining\nthe function of a process as geometry change of the workpiece, and\ndelineating the role of the machine or equipment, the actual means of\ncontrol for any process can be defined. This is addressed with the\n\"Variation Equation\" that illustrates the respective roles of three\nDavid E.

Finally, the limits on\ncontrol are expressed in a process taxonomy that categorizes\nprocesses according to how easily and rapidly the output can be\nchanged by manipulating the equipment.\nDavid E.
