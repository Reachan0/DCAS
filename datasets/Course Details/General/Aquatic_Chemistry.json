  "course_description": "This course details the quantitative treatment of chemical processes in aquatic systems such as lakes, oceans, rivers, estuaries, groundwaters, and wastewaters. It includes a brief review of chemical thermodynamics that is followed by discussion of acid-base, precipitation-dissolution, coordination, and reduction-oxidation reactions. Emphasis is on equilibrium calculations as a tool for understanding the variables that govern the chemical composition of aquatic systems and the fate of inorganic pollutants.\nThis course is offered through The MIT/WHOI Joint Program. The MIT/WHOI Joint Program is one of the premier marine science graduate programs in the world. It draws on the complementary strengths and approaches of two great institutions: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nTo teach fundamental concepts for understanding the behavior of inorganic species, such as carbonate and trace metals, in aquatic systems. Dominantly considers a thorough treatment of equilibrium, including acid-base, complexation, precipitation-dissolution, and reduction-oxidation reactions. There is a short introduction to chemical kinetics. A main skill you will learn is to determine the equilibrium composition of a system given its initial conditions. To help you gain an intuitive sense of the behavior of complex chemical systems, approximation techniques are emphasized.\n\nRequired Text\n\nMorel, Francois M., and Janet G.

Additionally, the TOTH eqn is equal to a\nknown quantity in this case- fantastic!\nTOTH: [H+] - [OH-] -[HS-] -2[S2-] = 0\nSo [H+] = [OH-] + [HS-] + 2[S2-]\nThe possibilities are:\n1) [H+] = [OH-] and [H+], [OH-] >> [HS-], [S2-]:\nBUT... when [H+] = [OH-], [H+], [OH-] << [HS-], so this is not the solution.\n2) [H+] = 2[S2-] and [H+], [S2-] >> [OH-], [HS-]\nBUT... when [H+] = [S2-], [H+], [S2-] << [OH-], [HS-], so this is not the solution.\n3) [H+] = [HS-] and [H+], [HS-] >> [OH-], [S2-]... ah ha! There is a place on the plot\nwhere this is true, and it looks like it's around pH = 4.1.\nWe can find the true pH using the TOTH equation, the assumptions in (3), KH and Ka1:\n[H+] = [HS-] = (Ka1) [H2S]/[H+]\n[H+]2 = (Ka1)(KH,H2S)(0.5 atm) = (10-7.02)(10-0.99)(10-0.3) = (10-8.31)\npH=4.16 (This subscript means that the subscripted digit is insignificant).\nIt remains to show that our assumptions hold by plugging pH into the appropriate eqns:\n[HS-] = (Ka1) [H2S]/[H+] = 10-4.1 M\n[OH-] = Kw/[H+] = 10-9.8 M\n[S2-] = (Ka2)(Ka1)[H2S]/[H+]2 = 10-13.9 M\nSo the assumption [H+], [HS-] >> [OH-], [S2-] holds!\n\n4c) adding NaOH.\nAdding base, we expect the pH to increase.\nH2O H+\nH2S Na+\nH2O\nOH\n-1\nH+\nH2S\nHS-\n-1\nS2-\n-2\nNa+\n[H2O]T\n[H2S]T\n[NaOH] T 1\n-1\nThe new TOTH:\n[H+] - [OH-] -[HS-] -2[S2-] = -[NaOH]T = -10-2.3 M\nThe possible solutions are:\n1) - [OH-] = - 10-2.3 M; [OH-] >> [HS-],[S2-], [H+]\n2) - [HS-] = - 10-2.3 M; [HS-]>> [OH-],[S2-], [H+]\n3) - 2[S2-] = - 10-2.3 M; [S2-] >>[OH-],[HS-],[H+]\nThere is a point on the graph where # 2 is true, so\nwe can solve #2 for [H+]:\n[HS-] = 10-2.3 M = (Ka1) [H2S]/[H+]\n]= 10-5.99 M, pH ≈6.0\n[H+]= (Ka1) [H2S]/[ HS\n4d) adding HNO3. Adding acid, we expect the pH to decrease.\nH2O\nH+\nH2S NO3\n-\nH2O\nOH\n-1\nH+\nH2S\nHS-\n-1\nS2-\n-2\nNO3\n-\n[H2O]T\n[H2S]T\n[HNO3]T 1\nThe new TOTH:\n[H+] - [OH-] -[HS-] -2[S2-] = [HNO3]T = 10-3 M\nThe only possible solution is\n[H+] = 10-3 M, so pH = 3.0\n\n5. Open v. Closed. (Answer from Linda Kalnejais' solutions, 2001).\nA closed system cannot exchange matter with its surroundings. In an open system, there\nis free exchange of materials across the boundaries of the system. For example, gas\nexchange across a water-air interface or precipitation/ dissolution of a solid phase\nrepresent material fluxing between a system and its surroundings.\nSome things to assess if a lake can be modeled as an open system:\n- What is the surface area: volume (SA:V) ratio of the lake?\nhigh SA:V\nlow SA:V\nA high SA:V ratio facilitates gas exchange, whereas a low ratio acts to isolate deeper\nwaters.\n- Is the lake well-mixed or is it stratified? If the lake is stratified the lower layers\nare somewhat isolated and so a closed system model may be appropriate.\n- Is the lake sheltered? Gas exchange may be restricted if there is not much wind\nblowing over the lake\n- Is there input/output of material from the sediments?\n- What are the timescales of the reactions I am interested in, and how do they\ncompare to the timescales of gas exchange or precipitation etc? If the timescales\nof exchange are much greater than those of interest, transfer of material is the\nslow process, so a closed model is appropriate."

      "content": "1.76 Aquatic Chemistry 2005- Problem Set #1\nOut: Tuesday, Sept 13th\nDue: Tuesday, Sept 27th\nCovers Chapter 1 and 2 through p. 70\n(Show your work)\nImportant concepts: Mass balance and electroneutrality equations, the tableau method:\nchoosing correct (independent) components, choosing good components, making the\ncorrect simplifying assumptions and verifying them, using gaseous phases with tableaux.\nLog C vs. pH diagrams. Solving equilibrium problems graphically and by\napproximation. Useful constants are in Table 4.2 (p.161) of the text. Use the \"ideal\"\nconstants (I=0).\n1. Do book problems 1.2 a,f,g, and i. Write out the species and component parts of the\ntableaux if acceptable.\n2. River water acquires most of its major ions via the dissolution of minerals in the\npresence of carbonic acid (from atmospheric CO2). To make up a simplified recipe for a\nriver water, I might start with pure water and add the minerals halite (NaCl), gypsum\n(CaSO4_nH2O), calcite (CaCO3), and magnesite (MgCO3), plus a known amount of CO2.\nSuppose I wait long enough so that minerals and the gas dissolve completely. The\ncarbonate minerals and CO2 together contribute to the \"dissolved inorganic carbon\" or,\nsimply, total carbon (\"CT\"), present in the water (CT= [H2CO3\n*] + [HCO3\n-] + [CO3\n2-]).\nTheses species are primarily responsible for the buffering (regulation of pH) of natural\nwaters.\nRecipe:\n[NaCl]T = 1 x 10-4 M\n[MgCO3]T = 1 x 10-3 M\n[CaSO4]T = 3 x 10-4 M\n[CO2]T = 3 x 10-3 M\n[CaCO3]T = 2 x 10-3 M\na) 11 species are present at equilibrium.\nYou only need to consider 3 reactions. What are they?\nWhy don't we consider these reactions?\nH2SO4 = HSO4\n- + H+\nHSO4- = SO4\n2- + H+\nHCO3\n- + OH- = CO3\n2-\nChoose the \"principal\" (i.e. best) set of components (hint: HCO3\n- should be a component)\nand set up the equations describing the equilibrium composition of the system defined by\nthe recipe above.\n\nb) To gain further practice dealing with tableaux, set up the corresponding equations with\nthe following alternative set of components: H+, H2O, NaCl, CaSO4, CaCO3, MgCO3,\nCO2, and HCl. With this tableau, using only neutral components and H+, your TOTH\nequation should look like an electroneutrality expression. Verify that the sets of\nequations from your two tableaux are equivalent (i.e. that equations from the one set can\nbe added or subtracted to make equations from the other).\nc) Write a recipe for a solution of identical composition using only the strong acids\nH2SO4 and HCl, and strong bases Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, and NaOH, and the gas CO2.\nd) Repeat parts a and c with the same recipe except for [CO2]T = 5 x 10-3 M.\ne) In a bog sediment's interstitial waters, hydrogen sulfide levels may build up as the\nresult of the activity of anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria. At the same time, carbon\ndioxide levels also build up as a result of bacterial respiration. To simulate this situation,\nI take my river water (from part a.) and bubble it with a gas mixture containing CO2 and\nH2S:\nSame recipe: [NaCl]T = 1 x 10-4 M\n[MgCO3]T = 1 x 10-3 M\n[CaSO4]T = 3 x 10-4 M\n[CO2]T = 3 x 10-3 M\n[CaCO3]T = 2 x 10-3 M\nplus:\npCO2 = 10-1.5 atm\npH2S = 0.5 atm\nAgain, choose the principle components and set up the equilibrium problem defined by\nthis recipe.\nNote: [CO2]T is irrelevant in this recipe. Why?\n3. Determine the equilibrium pH for each of the equilibrium problems you set up in\nproblem # 2 with the help of your tableau and log C vs. pH diagrams (if you are not\nconfident of how to do this, you may first want to do a few of the Practice Problems I\nhanded out). Draw fairly careful diagrams for parts a. and e.- i.e. try to get the slopes and\npositions of the various lines right; you do not need a new diagram for part d- just\nindicate how it looks different from part a. Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, SO4\n2-, and Cl- do not need to\nappear on your diagrams. Why not?\n4. log C. vs. pH diagram- open system: consider a solution you know to be in\nequilibrium with 0.5 atm H2S(g). Henry's Law tells us that in this case,\n[H2S](aq)\npH2S\n= K H,H2S =10-0.99 Matm-1\n\na) What is [H2S] if the pH of the solution is 5? 7? 9? (All you know about this solution\nis that it is in equilibrium with 0.5 atm H2S(g)--it could have some other acids or bases\nin it as well, so the pH could be anything).\nPlot log [H2S] vs. pH.\nThe first pKa of H2S is 7.0, so [H +][HS-]\n[H2S]\n=10-7.0 M (note: usually units are not shown).\nWhat is [HS-] in this solution if the pH is 5? 7? 9?\nThe second pKa is 13.9. What is [S2-] if the pH is 5? 7? 9?\nPlot both log [HS-] and log [S2-] vs. pH on the diagram you started.\nComplete the diagram by plotting log[H+] and log [OH-] vs. pH.\nThe information on this diagram will be valid for any solution in equilibrium with 0.5\natm H2S (g).\nb) Suppose you made a solution by letting pure water equilibrate with 0.5 atm H2S (g).\nMake two tableaux for this system, one with HS- as a component and the other with H2S\nas the component. Why is it better to choose H2S as a component? What is the TOTH\nequation in this case? Identify the only place on your diagram where this equation is\nsatisfied. Calculate the pH of the solution.\nc) Calculate the pH for a solution containing 0.005 M sodium hydroxide, completely\ndissolved and in equilibrium with 0.5 atm H2S(g). (Hint: will the pH be higher or lower\nthan your answer from part b?)\nd) Calculate the pH of a solution containing 0.001 M [HNO3]T in equilibrium with 0.5\natm H2S(g).\n5. Discuss what is meant by \"open\" and \"closed\" systems in the context of aquatic\nchemistry equilibrium calculations. Suppose you are asked to construct an equilibrium\nmodel for the acid-base chemistry of a lake. What questions would you ask to help\ndecide whether to model the lake as \"open\" or \"closed\" with respect to both gaseous and\nsolid phases?"

Book problem 4.1. Hint: for parts a, b, and d, you do not need to calculate the equilibrium\ncomposition of these systems to determine their total alkalinity.\n2. Book problem 4.4\n3. Book problem 4.12. Assume that Na+ is the only cation other than H+ and that there are no\n=\nstrong acid anions (i.e. Cl-, SO4 , etc.)\n4. A sample of water from the overflow of the recarbonation basin that follows a\nprecipitation/softening process has a pH of 9.0. A 200 ml sample of the water requires 24 ml of\n0.02 N H2SO4 to titrate it to the CO2 equivalence point (pH=~4.5). Assuming the sample contains\n-\nno calcite particles, what is the total alkalinity? Calculate the contributions of HCO3 , CO3\n2-, and\nOH- to the total alkalinity (you may assume that only carbonate species are present and all\nactivity coefficients are equal to unity).\n\n5 To a first approximation, photosynthesis and respiration change total carbon without changing\nalkalinity according to the reaction:\nCO2(aq) + H2O = CH2O(aq) + O2(aq)\nThese processes are often much faster than gas exchange\nThis question examines whether measuring pH changes would be a good way to quantify the rate\nof change in total inorganic carbon due to photosynthesis and respiration. We will consider both\na freshwater and seawater system with an alkalinity of 2.5 meq and a pH around 8.3. Do not use\napproximations in these calculations. A spreadsheet may be helpful.\na) Calculate CT as a function of pH (range 8 to 9) for the freshwater.\nb) Calculate CT as a function of pH (range 8 to 9) for the seawater assuming that only carbonate\nspecies contribute to alkalinity. Due to a combination of ionic strength effects and complexation\nreactions (which will be discussed in later the class), you will need to use a value of 6.0 for the\npKa,1 of H2CO3\n* and 9.1 for the pKa,2 of HCO3\n-.\nc) Finally, calculate CT as a function of pH (range 8 to 9) for seawater including the effect of\nborate on alkalinity. Total borate (boric acid + borate) in seawater is 0.4 mM. Use a pKa of 8.7\nfor boric acid.\nPlot your results for parts (a), (b), and (c)\nd) Suppose I have a method that can measure pH with a precision of ±0.005 pH units.

Chemical analyses reveal the presence of 0.0001 M [H2SiO3]T and 0.01 M\n[Na+]T. What is the pH of this fluid if it has reached a state of thermodynamic equilibrium with\nthe host rock? Ignore ionic strength effects.\ne) You notice that the host rock also contains quartz. Rewrite the reaction from part (b) so that it\ncontains the mineral quartz (SiO2) instead of H2SiO3 and calculate a new equilibrium constant\n(Requisite thermodynamic data is in Table 5.4 of the book). Using this new reaction, calculate\nthe pH of the fluid. What can you say about the saturation state of the fluid with respect to quartz\nbased on your result?\nProblem 2. Book problem 5.10 part a: Calculate the composition of a groundwater in equilibrium\nwith PCO2 = 10-1.5 atm, calcite, albite, and kaolinite.\nCOMMENT: In this system, albite weathers to kaolinite until albite and kaolinite are both in\nequilibrium with the solution. This happens when H2SiO3 and Na+, which are initially absent in\nsolution, build up until they reach saturation (expressed by the weathering reaction in Table 5.4).\nSome dissolved Al also results from this process, but its concentration remains negligible.\nHINT: You should end up with an equation that is best solved by trial and error, or by using a\ncomputer root finding algorithm. You can get a good first approximation of the solution pH by\nneglecting the effect of albite weathering and considering only calcite.\n\nProblem 3.\nWhen the groundwater in Problem 3 emerges from a spring and enters into contact with the\natmosphere, it is initially oversaturated with CO2. Why must this be the case? As CO2(g) escapes,\ncalcite becomes oversaturated and precipitates from solution. Discuss, using equations if\npossible, how you would expect the pH, alkalinity, and CT in this water to change as CO2(g) is\nlost to the atmosphere and calcite is lost to the sediments. Calculate the final composition of this\nwater (pH, alkalinity, [Ca2+]) when equilibrium with the atmosphere and calcite is reached.\nProblem 4. - All thermodynamic data necessary for this problem are in Table 5.4 of the book.\nIgnore ionic strength effects for this question.\na) Draw a logC-pH diagram showing the aqueous speciation of Fe(II) in a 10-8 M [Fe2+]T\n-\nsolution as a function of pH. Consider the species Fe2+, FeOH+, Fe(OH)2, Fe(OH)3 , H+, and OH-.\nDo not consider precipitation of solids.\nb) If Fe(OH)2(s) were allowed to precipitate, what is the critical pH (pH of first precipitation)?\nAdd the stability field for Fe(OH)2(s) to your logC-pH diagram.\nc) Hydrogen sulfide is added to the solution to attain a total concentration ([H2S]T) equal to 10-5\nM. What is the critical pH for FeS(s)? Modify the diagram to show the stability field for FeS(s)?\nd) Which mineral is more stable at pH values less then 12?\ne) Recalculate the critical pH for Fe(OH)2(s) ignoring the formation of Fe(II) aqueous complexes.\nDoes aqueous complexation increase or decrease the solubility of Fe(OH)2(s)?"

      "content": "Model exam Questions\n1. Unicellular organisms have several strategies to acquire Fe when it is low or tied up in\nnon-bioavailable forms, such as strong organic complexes. One approach is to reduce\nthe Fe(III) complexes at the cell surface, since Fe(II) complexes are weaker and\ndissociate more readily, enabling the Fe to be taken up by receptors. Another approach\nis to produce and excrete a strong chelator, called a siderophores, that complexes Fe in\nthe bulk solution. The Fe-siderophore complex can then be taken up by a specialized\ntransport system in the cell.\nThe following table shows stability constants for Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexes with a\nsuite of chelators, taken from the NIST data base\nlog β1\nLigand\nFe2+\nFe3+\nEDTA\n14.3\n25.1\nCDTA\n18.9\nNTA\n8.9\n15.9\nDTPA\n16.2\nTETA\n13.3\n26.5\nlog β2\n1,10-phenanthroline\n11.2\n11.4\nArrange these ligands in order, from easiest to most difficult to reduce, to determine\nwhich would be most likely to be bioavailable to organisms using the reductive approach.\nThen arrange them in order, showing which would be most bioavailable to an organism\nthat produces siderophores.\nShow equations to justify your rankings, above. Neglect any interactions with Ca2+,\nMg2+ or H+.\nA first-year JP student is studying Fe uptake in two marine phytoplankton species, A and\nB, using a media containing 1uM EDTA and 0.05uM Fe.

She observes an immediate decrease in Fe uptake in A,\nbut the uptake rate in B is unaffected.\nBased on these data, speculate about which Fe acquisition strategy is used by A or B.\nThermodynamics aside, what is an obvious disadvantage for marine organisms using the\nsiderophores production strategy.

He assumes that this is because the reaction is reversible so he adds 10-5 M\nEDTA to the solution. The reaction now displays pseudo-first order kinetics, but the\ninitial rate is about 10x faster than in the original solution.\na) How did he determine that the reaction was pseudo-first order in the presence of\nEDTA? How did he show that it departed from pseudo-first order behavior in the first\nplace? How could this reaction be reversible? What is the reductant?\nb) How would EDTA affect the reverse reaction?
