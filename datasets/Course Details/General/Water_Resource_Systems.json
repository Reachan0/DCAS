I will circulate your responses to all students so you can organize\nteams yourselves. By Oct. 17 your team should meet to focus your topic, select a\npreliminary site, and schedule an initial meeting with me. We will meet as required in\nthe last half of October to go over the information you need to compile for a detailed (2+\npp.) team project proposal due Nov. 2. A final team report on your project will be due on\nthe last day of classes. All or part of your team can meet with me during November as\nrequired to go over questions, etc.\n\nWherever possible, your project should be based on data from a real site or problem.\n\nThe effort spent on one of these projects should be about the same as 5 problem sets\n(about 45 hours), so please scope your project topic so that you can produce a satisfactory\nresult within this time constraint.\n\n1. Real-time reservoir control\n\ni) Take measurements of relevant variables (i.e. compile historical measurements for use\nin a retrospective test of your control strategy))\nii) Predict future inflows based on past data, accounting for both short and longer term\ntemporal correlation.\niii) Determine optimal reservoir releases for all time steps out to a specified time horizon\niv) Implement releases for next time step only, then repeat entire process\n\n2. Integrated water resource management for a semi-arid area\n\ni) Consider all sources and demands for water for the selected area\nii) Design a system that extracts, collects, conveys, treats, recycles, disposes water at\nvarious locations and seasons, with the overall goal of making best use of this limited\nresource\niii) Optimize your candidate system by selecting the \"best\" components, facility\ncapacities, operating policies, etc., considering both cost and performance.\n\ni) Formulate a well-posed parameter estimation, specifying model parameters to be\nestimated and measurements to be used, for a model of \"reasonable\" size and complexity.\nUse real data if possible.\n\nii) Simplify the model, as req uired, to make the parameter estimation procedure\ncomputationally feasible.\niii) Test and compare more than one method for estimating the parameters for your\nproblem.\niv) Analyze the computational feasibility/scalability and performance of your approach\nfor larger problems.\n\n4.

Summarize in a few sentences your engineering-related work experience (outside of a\nuniversity setting).\n\nTechnical Skills:\n\nI know that most of you could carry out the following, given appropriate references and\nenough time. I am interested primarily in 1) whether you have ever done any of these\nthings already and 2) if you could do them relatively easily now without lots of research\nand effort.\n\n1. Could you write a MATLAB code to simulate runoff from a watershed if you were\ngiven a spatially lumped description of the rainfall-runoff process in the form of an\nordinary differential equation?\n\n2. Could you fit (by hand) a quadratic curve to a set of (x,y) data and construct\nconfidence intervals that extend beyond the range of the data?\n\n3. Could you perform an eigen decomposition of a 3 by 3 matrix by hand? On\nMATLAB?\n\n4. Could you generate, in MATLAB, a random autregressive type 2, AR(2), time series\nto simulate daily variations in an environmental variable such as air temperature?\n\n5. Could you find (by hand) the relative maxima of a specified differentiable function of\n3 unknowns, subject to 2 specified linear equality constraints in these unknowns? What\nif the constraints are inequalities?\n\n6. Do you know the difference between a local and global minimum?\n\n7. Have you used optimization software? What kind?\n\n8.

Please assess the nature of your \"policy\" orientation on a scale\nof 0-10, where 0 is no interest in policy (you only care about mathematical analysis) and\n10 is interest only in policy aspects (you would rather avoid mathematics). Realizing that\nsuch a rating is simplistic, please feel free to elaborate in a few sentences.\n\n2. How do you feel about a subject that derives your grade from a large individualized\nproject vs. one that relies on frequent (e.g. weekly) problem sets?\n\n3. Please summarize in a few sentences your expectations for this subject. Indicate what\nskills, insights, etc. you would like to take away from your experience."

The decision variables\nare the pumping rates and pumping lifts (depths to the water table) at the four wells:\n\nx = [ x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ]\nPumping rates (m3/sec) at wells 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\ny = [ y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 ]\nPumping lifts (m.) at wells 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\nNet benefit is measured in terms of the difference between the annual revenues obtained\nfrom irrigated crops and the annual costs associated with pumping and delivery:\n\nObjective: F = R - C\nRevenue:\n\nCost:\n\nâ\n=\n-\n=\n)\n(\ni\ni\ni\nx\nb\nax\nR\nâ\n=\n=\ni\ni\ni y\nex\nC\n\nNote that the marginal revenue dR/dxi for each well decreases to zero as the quantity\npumped increases to b/2. This reflects the decreasing demand for increasing amounts of\npumped water. The water cost is proportional to the electrical energy required to pump at\na rate xi over a depth yi for a growing season of 4 months.\n\nPumping at each well affects the drawdown at the other wells. This effect may be\nquantified with a groundwater model or through pumping tests. In either case, there is a\nlinear relationship between the vectors x and y if the aquifer is confined (as we assume\nhere). If we also assume the groundwater system is in steady-state the pumping-lift\nrelationship may be summarized with a symmetric response matrix A. Each element Aij\nof this matrix relates the steady state lift yi at well i (in m.) to the steady-state pumping\nrate xj at well j (m3/sec):\n\nsec/m\n\nwhere\nâ¥\nâ¥\nâ¥\nâ¥\nâ¦\nâ¤\nâ¢\nâ¢\nâ¢\nâ¢\nâ£\nâ¡\n=\n=\nA\nx\nA\ny\nj\nij\ni\n\nWhen the response matrix relationship is substituted in the objective function expressions\nabove the result is a quadratic objective.

To check this you will need to construct a Hessian\nmatrix and use MATLAB to test its eigenvalues for your particular set of problem\ninputs.\n\n3). Solve the problem using GAMS. If the objective function is not concave try a\nfew different initial feasible solutions to provide confidence that the GAMS\nsolution is a global maximum.\n\n4).

Should it include social and political institutions?\n\nWe often try to find the \"best\" solution - but how do we define \"best\"?\n\nTraditional examples of water resource systems problems:\n\n- River basin management - select facilities (reservoirs, aqueducts, irrigation\ninfrastructure, etc.) to maximize benefit from resource\n- Aquifer management - focus on installation and operation of wells and recharge areas,\nlonger time scales make water quality issues especially important\n- Capacity expansion - how much should facilities be expanded, when?\n- Real-time operations - decisions are. What to do today, considering impacts on the future\n(e.g. reservoir operations)\n- Remediation - select best mix of remedies for cleaning up contamination, especially in\nsubsurface\n\nNew examples that go beyond water resources but deal with environment:\n\n- Hazard prevention/mitigation - how should we respond to hazards such as hurricanes and\nassociated flooding, rebuilding, prevention, etc.\n\n- Energy-related topics - petroleum reservoir development, carbon sequestration,\ninvestment in alternative energy sources, etc.\n- Merging of diverse types of data for environmental characterization - data fusion, data\nassimilation\n\nWhat do these problems have in common?\n\n1. Tradeoffs - optimal decision trades off opposing effects (often benefits vs. costs).\n2. Constraints - limited resources\n3.
