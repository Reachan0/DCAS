Because the reaction volume is\ndetermined by the molecular organization within\nthe multilayers, the thin film itself acts as a\nnanoreactor to define the final size of the Ag\nparticles. This is because the metal ions in a silver-\ncontaining solution (Ag+) attach to the polymer by\nexchanging with hydrogen in, for example,\ncarboxylic groups of the polymer, and then reduce to metal particles (Ago) by\nexchanging with hydrogens in, for example, the amine groups of a second chemical\nsuch as a diamine. Thus, the polymer multilayer is a nanoreactor that is capable of\ncreating uniformly dispersed, nanometer sized particles of Ag metal (~2 - 4 nm\ndiameter). You will characterize the Ag content of the samples through UV-Vis\nspectroscopic analysis of energy absorption, and correlate this Ag content with the\nability of these Ag-loaded multilayers to kill bacteria that are seeded and cultured on the\nsurface.\nII.

Introduction\nStep growth polymerization is one of the main types of polymerization reactions in\nsynthetic polymer chemistry. Initially, monomers combine to form oligomers and\npolymer chains are formed by the stepwise combination of monomers, oligomers or\nother polymer chains. During this reaction, a byproduct may be formed. If the\nbyproduct of the step growth reaction is a small molecule such as water or HCl, the step\ngrowth reaction is termed polycondensation.\nAn illustration of stepwise growth is given here for a four-unit polymer, where each * is a\nmonomer and A and B are the functional groups at the end of the monomer *. This\npolymer **** could be formed in one of two ways:\nAddition of a monomer to a chain of three-monomers (a trimer), or 1 + 3;\nA*A + B***B ‚ A****B + AB\n(1a)\n\nAddition of two chains of two-monomers (dimers) to each other, or 2 + 2.\nA**A\n+\nB**B\n‚\nA****B +\nAB\n(1b)\nSimilarly, there are two ways to directly form a five-unit polymer from only two\nmonomers and three ways to form a six-unit polymer...\nNylon is an example of a polyamide, which is a polymer where monomers are\nconnected by amide groups ( -C(=O)-NH- ). At high concentrations of the monomer, the\nreaction will proceed via polycondensation of diacid or diamine monomers. Diacid (or\ndiamine) condensation creates (n - 1) moles of H2O as a byproduct for every n moles of\nmonomer incorporated into a chain. Such a reaction is near equilibrium at moderate\ntemperatures (Keq ~ 1 - 10), which means there is little driving force to form the polymer\nat these temperatures. Thus, high temperatures and efficient removal of water\nbyproduct are required to drive the reaction to generate the amide product.\nDiacid chloride condensation is an alternative synthesis route, and is also an\nexample of nucleophilic acyl substitution. Here, the (-COOH) acid group is replaced with\na more reactive acyl derivative (-C(=O)-Cl) to combine with the amine group\n(nucleophile). In this case, the equilibrium constant Keq is ~100 - 1000 and results in\ncreation of (n - 1) moles of HCl as a byproduct for every n moles of reacted monomer.\nThe HCl byproduct can be neutralized in the presence of a weak base in the reaction\nsolvent. This is a rapid reaction (fast, irreversible and exothermic) that is consequently\ndifficult to control. To achieve polymerization with high molecular weight, the\nconcentration of reactants must be low, the temperature must be controlled typically\nbelow room temperature, and the solvent must be a good solvent for both the\nmonomers and the polymer product.\nSince both of these polycondensation reactions have disadvantages in terms of\nefficient polymerization, an important alternative is interfacial polymerization. Here, the\nrapid kinetics of the reaction between diamines and diacid chlorides occurs at the\ninterface of two immiscible phases. In unstirred interfacial polymerization, one monomer\nA is dissolved in an organic phase and the other monomer B is dissolved in an inorganic\nphase. An interface forms between the two immiscible (non-mixing) phases. The\n3.034 FALL 2005\nLABORATORY 2\n\npolymer is formed as a membrane at the interface, and pulled through the topmost\nphase by continuous mechanical removal to produce a rope. (In stirred interfacial\npolymerization, A-rich phase is dispersed as tiny droplets in B-rich phase through high-\nspeed mechanical mixing. This approach is used to create hollow microcapsules and\nfully dense microspheres for applications such as drug delivery.)\nIn this laboratory experiment, you will conduct unstirred interfacial polymerization\nreactions to produce nylon, and will analyze the thermal properties of your nylon\nproducts. You will form three types of nylon: Nylon 8,6 8,8 and 8,10. The first number\nrefers to the number of carbons in the amine group-containing monomer of the nylon\nand the second refers to the number of carbons in the diacid chloride or acyl derivative\ngroup-containing monomer of the nylon. The nylons 8,6 8,8,and 8,10 are formed by\nthe reaction of 1,8 diamino octane (DAO) with diacid chlorides (adipoyl chloride(C=6),\nsuberoyl chloride(C=8), and sebacoyl dichloride(C=10)), respectively.\nThe polymer forms at the interface between a layer of DAO dissolved in water -\nthe aqueous phase - and a layer of diacid chloride dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM)\n- the organic phase. The aqueous phase contains a weak base, sodium carbonate, to\nneutralize the HCl and maintain the efficiency of the reaction:\n2HCl + Na2CO3 ‚ 2NaCl + H2O + CO2\n(2)\nThe organic phase is denser than water, and thus forms the lower phase. After pouring\nthe aqueous phase on top, the interfacial polymerization immediately forms a thin film of\nnylon at the interface. This film prevents or at least slows further reaction by acting as a\nphysical barrier to monomer mixing. By pulling the film up out of the interface, new\ninterface is exposed and the new film forms continuously at the fresh interface. The\nstoichiometry of the interface is controlled by the mass transfer-controlled rate of\ndiffusion (in the organic phase) and consumption of the monomer species. That is, the\nratio of A to B is 1:1 in this diffusion-controlled reaction.\nII. Objectives\nThe goals of this laboratory experiment are to:\n- Synthesize \"ropes\" of Nylon 8,6 8,8 and 8,10 through unstirred interfacial\npolymerization\n- Measure thermal properties of the synthesized polymers through differential\nscanning calorimetry (DSC)\n- Synthesize supported membranes of nylon 8,6, 8,8 and 8,10\n- Test wettability and permeability of synthesized polymer on supported membranes\n3.034 FALL 2005\nLABORATORY 2"

Introduction\nEnzymes are proteins that serve a specific function: They catalyze chemical\nreactions, meaning that they initiate / facilitate reactions without being consumed\nor altered significantly in the process. Enzymes are typically named by the\nfollowing convention: Substrate + ase. For example, an enzyme that catalyzes\ndegradation of another protein is called a proteinase or protease. An enzyme\nthat digests milk sugar (lactose) is called lactase.\nIn this laboratory, you will learn how to visualize the effects of an enzyme\nthat ligates (cuts) DNA into small fragments through gel electrophoresis.\nRestriction enzymes are DNA-cutting enzymes found in bacteria (and harvested\nfrom them for use). Because they cut within the molecule, they are often called\nrestriction endonucleases. A restriction enzyme recognizes and cuts DNA only at\na particular sequence of nucleotides, or DNA bases A, T, G and C. For example,\nE. coli bacteria that carry the HindIII gene from the bacterium Haemophilus\ninfluenzae Rd can be used to produce an enzyme named HindIII (\"HIND\nTHREE\") that cuts double-stranded DNA into double-stranded DNA fragments\nwherever it encounters the sequence:\nThe cut is made between the adjacent A and T, as shown by the arrows. This\nsequence is found in many DNA, including linear, double-stranded DNA isolated\nfrom the bacteriophage lambda (Lambda DNA) which has 48,502 base pairs.\nTreatment of Lambda DNA with this enzyme produces exactly 7 fragments, each\nwith a precise length and nucleotide sequence.\nThis fragmentation of the DNA via the restriction enzymes is called\nrestriction enzyme digestion, and occurs during incubation of the enzyme with\nthe double-stranded DNA molecules in a NaCl buffer of concentration and\ntemperature optimized for the enzyme activity. These fragments can be\nseparated from one another through gel electrophoresis, a technique that\nseparates charged molecules under the influence of an electric field. The\nsequence of each fragment is determined by the molecular weight of each\nfragment and a priori knowledge of the cutting site of the particular restriction\nenzyme used.\nYou will demonstrate the effect of this restriction enzyme digestion for a\nplasmid (circular rings of double-stranded DNA) called pBPZ, analyzed via gel\nelectrophoresis. Since the lengths of the Lambda/HindIII digest are well known,\nyou will use the fragment lengths (\"bands\") from the Lambda digest as a marker\nlane or \"ladder\" , to determine the segment lengths of the pBPZ digest. In gel\nelectrophoresis , the gel is made from agarose dissolved in a gel stain solution\n[SYBR safe DNA gel stain]. The gel stain binds to nucleic acids and fluoresces\nunder UV illumination, facilitating the visualization of the DNA fragments.\n3.034 FALL 2005\nLABORATORY 3\n\nII.

Introduction\nA virus is a particle contains nucleic acids within a protective coat of proteins and lipids\ncalled the capsid, but does not possess the cellular machinery (nucleus and organelles)\nto replicate that RNA/DNA and thus to replicate itself. Instead, viruses are parasites that\nreproduce by infecting cells and hijacking the machinery of the cells to make copies of\nviral DNA and thus viral gene products. Strictly speaking, a virus infects eukaryotes\n(which contain a nucleus), whereas a bacteriophage or phage infects prokaryotes\nincluding bacteria (which do not\ncontain a true nucleus).\nFigure 1. (a) TEM micrograph of\nbacteriophage called SP105.\nBefore we understood how\nPhage are typically 20 - 800 nm\nviruses and phages worked,\nin length, with a capsid diameter\nthese particles were not much\non the order of 8 - 80 nm. (b)\nhelp to humans. As you know,\nSchematic of virus components.\nviral infections cause human\nillness ranging from the\nhttp://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mayer/phage.htm\ncommon cold to HIV, and are\ndifficult to target with\nvaccination because of rapid\ngenetic mutation within the\nbody. However, we increasingly\ntake advantage of the dramatic\nreplication potential of viral\nnucleic acids and gene\nproducts by manipulating the\ngenome and environment of the\nvirus itself. This approach\nenables genetic engineering (by\nusing viruses to introduce new DNA into cells that can express these gene products, as\nyou explored via plasmids in Laboratory Experiment 3), engineering of new crystals with\nthe potential for added function (by patterning viruses on inorganic surfaces), and new\ninorganic material structures (by selecting viruses to recognize and/or sequester\ninorganic particles such as metals and semiconductors). Material-binding functions are\nengineered by using phage libraries, which are collections of cloned fragments of\nbacteriophage DNA. Each unique DNA sequence is one member of this library, and\nsuch libraries are commercially available for specific bacteriophages. The high aspect\nratio (length/diameter) of viruses contributes to the capacity to form dense, anisotropic\nmaterial phases.\nIn this laboratory experiment, you will learn how phage are selected and\nengineered as materials that exhibit specific functions, including binding to inorganic\nmaterials, formation of liquid crystals, and formation of virus-based fibers. To use\nviruses at the high concentrations required for use as materials, it is necessary to\namplify (increase the number of) the phage significantly, via replication in bacteria. We\ncompleted this large-scale amplification with the help of graduate student Chung-Yi\nChiang; the protocol is described on page 9, for your interest.\n3.034 FALL 2005\nLABORATORY 4\nImage removed due to copyright reasons.\nImage removed due\nto copyright reasons.\nSee:\n\nII.
