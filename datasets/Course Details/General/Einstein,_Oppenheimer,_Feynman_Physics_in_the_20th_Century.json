For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use/\n\nBut Was It Real?\nIn 1845, Faraday thought of a way to demonstrate that the ether was a real, physical\nsubstance: he found that a magnetic field will rotate the plane of polarization of light.\n(Now known as the \"Faraday effect\" or \"Faraday rotation.\")\nTo Faraday and his peers, this was striking\nevidence that the ether must be real: the B field\nwas a twisting strain in the ether (a kind of\ntorsion), and it deformed the material medium\nwithin which light traveled.\nCf. Daschner, Kaiser, and Formaggio, \"Exploiting Faraday rotation to jam quantum key distribution\nvia polarized photons,\" Quantum Information and Computation 19 (2019): 1313-1324, arXiv:1905.01359.\n\nFaraday Summary\nMichael Faraday worked on a variety of natural phenomena (chemistry, optics,\nelectrolysis, electricity, magnetism ...) with a special interest in the interconvertibility of\nforces -- as his Sandemanian religion emphasized, there was an essential unity of nature.\nHe was never trained in mathematics, but was an apprenticed tinkerer who became a\nleading experimentalist, eventually working at the Royal Institution (rather than at a\nuniversity).\nHe introduced lines of force and then fields as ways to characterize the state of the all-\npervasive ether, the medium within which natural forces unfolded, and the reason for\nan underlying unity.\nIn place of Newtonian \"action at a distance,\" Faraday aimed to explain all physical\nphenomena in terms of local fields, which could convey effects point-by-point\nthroughout the ether.\n\nQuestions?\n\nThomson and Maxwell: Math and Mechanics\nFaraday used very little formal mathematics in his\nstudies -- not surprising, since he never studied\nmath beyond elementary geometry. A tremendous\nshift began in the mid-19th century: a new culture\nof research centered around intense mathematical\ntraining (especially at Cambridge University).\nTwo products of that new training -- William\nThomson (later Lord Kelvin) and James Clerk Maxwell\n-- picked up Faraday's pictorial work and translated\nit into a powerful mathematical formalism. Both\nCambridge University, King's Parade, ca. 1870\nwere Scottish born and educated at Cambridge in\nImage is in the public domain.\nthe 1840s and 1850s.\n\nThomson and Maxwell: Math and Mechanics\nBoth Thomson and Maxwell became deeply involved with practical engineering applications of\nthe physics of the ether, even as they pursued fancy mathematical approaches.\nMost important application: telegraphy. Britain was an island with distant colonies; it also sought\nto strengthen global trading relationships.\nImage is in the public domain.\n\nThomson and Maxwell: Math and Mechanics\nMaxwell, pp. vii-viii: \"The important applications\nof electromagnetism to telegraphy have also reacted on\npure science by giving a commercial value to accurate\nelectrical measurements, and by affording to\nelectricians the use of apparatus on a scale which\ngreatly transcends that of any ordinary laboratory.\nThe consequences of this demand for electrical knowledge,\nand of these experimental opportunities for acquiring\nit, have been already very great, both in stimulating\nthe energies of advanced electricians, and in diffusing\namong practical men a degree of accurate knowledge\nwhich is likely to conduce to the general scientific\nprogress of the whole engineering profession.\"\n(c) Source unknown.

New mathematical techniques (like curl) could\nquantify the medium's response to pressures.\nIn a famous set of lectures in\nBaltimore, Thomson encouraged his\nlisteners to get a feel for the new physics:\n\"Stick your hand in a bowl of jelly, and\nsee how it wiggles and vibrates as you\nmove your hand around.\"\nThat was what physics was all about!\n(... it's 892 pages!)\n(c) Cambridge University Press.

For\nmore information, see\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use/\n\nMaxwell: Mechanical Models of the Ether\nJames Clerk Maxwell was a few years younger than Thomson.\nHe also became steeped in the new Cambridge mathematical\napproach, and developed further analogies between\nelectromagnetic and mechanical systems.\nTo model the effects of a magnetic field on the ether, he\nimagined that the B field lines were under tension, and were\nkept apart from each other by a kind of hydrostatic pressure\nMaxwell, \"On Faraday's\nLines of Force,\" 1856\nin an incompressible fluid: \"molecular vortices.\"\nImage is in the public domain.\nBetween the vortices were \"idle wheels,\" which stayed in place but could rotate at different\nspeeds. If an external force changed the rate at which one vortex was spinning, that would change\nthe rate of spin of its nearest neighboring idle wheels. Those, in turn, would change the rotation\nspeed of their nearest neighbors (akin to conveyor belts). All local effects, by which a magnetic\ndisturbance could propagate through the medium.\n\nMaxwell: Mechanical Models of the Ether\nMaxwell, p. 157: The action of one \"electrical system\" on another is \"effected, not\nby direct action at a distance, but by means of a distribution of stress in a medium\nextending continuously [throughout space].\"\nMaxwell, p. 164: \"The distribution of stress [in the elastic-medium ether] is\nprecisely that to which Faraday was led in his investigation of induction [...]. At every\npoint of the medium there is a state of stress such that there is tension along the\nlines of force and pressure in all directions at right angles to these lines.\"\n\nthe British style:\nMaxwell: Mechanical Models of the Ether\nIn a review of Oliver Lodge's follow-up book, Modern Views of\nElectricity (1889), the French physicist Pierre Duhem exclaimed on\n\"Here is a book intended to expound the modern\ntheories of electricity [...]. In it there are nothing but\nstrings which move around pulleys, which roll around\ndrums, which go through pearl beads, which carry\nweights; and tubes which pump water while others\nswell and contract; toothed wheels are geared to one\nanother and engage hooks.

For more information, see\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use/\n\nMaxwell: Mechanical Models of the Ether\nIn 1865, Maxwell fixed some parameters in\nhis model (akin to spring constants), based on\nexperimental studies of how E and B fields\nbehaved. Then he calculated how quickly a\nmechanical disturbance would propagate within\nhis model of the ether, and he found that the\nfields propagated at the speed of light:\nImage is in the public domain.\n\"The velocity of transverse undulations in our hypothetical medium [...] agrees so exactly\nwith the velocity of light calculated from optical experiments [...] that we can scarcely avoid\nthe inference that light consists of the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of\nelectric and magnetic phenomena.\"\nLight was nothing other than the propagation of E and B fields within the luminiferous ether!\n\nSummary\nLeading natural philosophers in the 19th century were convinced that the world was made\nof very different entities than what present-day physicists believe: not elementary particles in a\nvacuum, but mechanical disturbances in an all-pervasive, elastic medium, the \"ether.\"\nUntil the mid-19th century, leading natural philosophers could enter research careers based\non an apprenticeship model, and worked in \"institutes\" or \"academies\" (with no formal teaching\nfunction), not at universities.\nFaraday, Thomson, and Maxwell each pursued analogies between the luminiferous ether and\nmechanical systems: Faraday with rudimentary geometrical arguments and novel visual aids,\nThomson and Maxwell with increasingly sophisticated mathematical tools. They became\nconvinced of a \"mechanical worldview\": electromagnetic effects were at root mechanical.\nMoreover, local causes yielded local effects: no \"action at a distance.\"\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.042J / 8.225J Einstein, Oppenheimer, Feynman: Physics in the 20th Century\nFall 2020\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

To Maxwell and his peers,\nMaxwell's equations were founded on a fundamentally different idea of\nwhat the world is made of than our modern views.\nTo Maxwell, none of this was true! (The electron wasn't discovered for another 20 years after\npublication of his Treatise.) To the Maxwellians, the world was a continuum, not a collection of\ndiscrete point particles. They were \"inverted atomists\": \"Instead of building the world out of\natoms, they built atoms out of the world.\" (Buchwald)\nTo us, Maxwell's equations describe the behavior\nof fundamental charged particles (electrons, ions).\nElectric charge is conserved: a fixed amount of\ncharge is attached to each microscopic charge-\ncarrier. Electric current is nothing more than\nfundamental charge-carriers in motion.\n(c) Circuit Globe. All rights reserved. This content is\nexcluded from our Creative Commons license.

The parameters e and s\ncharacterize how easily the fundamental charges can\nbe rearranged.\nFor us, charge comes first. For the Maxwellians, charge\nwas a secondary effect of the state of the medium.\n\nMaxwell Summary\nAlthough we still use \"Maxwell's Equations\" (thank you,\nOliver Heaviside!), the way we interpret those equations is almost\nexactly the opposite of how the Maxwellians did.\nFor Maxwell, like Faraday and Thomson, the ether came first. Theirs\nwas a mechanical worldview. Continuity was the key: all of physics came\ndown to the behavior of a continuous elastic medium, which supported\ncontiguous local actions. No point particles, no fundamental charges --\nall (time-varying) states of the ether.\n\nQuestions?\n\nTraining Cambridge Wranglers\nMichael Faraday had practically no mathematical training.

Make sure no one could\never catch up with a light wave!\n\nKinematics First\nInspired by Mach, Einstein began\nwith kinematics, not dynamics:\nWhat we can observe are bodies in\nmotion through space and time.\n(c) source unknown.

After a friend of Einstein's encouraged Minkowski\nto read Einstein's 1905 paper, Minkowski replied: \"I really\nwouldn't have thought Einstein capable of that.\"\nTo another, Minkowski recalled, \"It came as a tremendous surprise, for in his student days\nEinstein had been a lazy dog. ...

So\nhe reformulated the work in his own way in 1908.\nMinkowski specialized in geometry. He had even written a book (first published in 1896)\non The Geometry of Numbers, in which he had cast the abstract subject of number theory\ninto geometrical terms.\nWhen he turned to Einstein's work on the electrodynamics of moving bodies, he did so\nas a geometer, rather than as a physicist who focused on performing measurements or a\nphilosopher interested in Machian positivism.\nMinkowski and Spacetime\n\nWorldlines\nt\nx\nUse coordinates such that light travels one unit\nof space in each unit of time, e.g. [t] ~ seconds\nand [x] ~ light-seconds.

Then they could use the inversion technique to produce new solutions\n.\nThey sought to prove they had found the most general class of transformations L(v).\nFor the Wranglers, that's what relativity was all about -- not the ether, not Machian positivism,\nnot Minkowski's space-time ...\n\nReception of Relativity: Summary\nResearchers did not just read Einstein's paper and become\ndevoted Einsteinians. Most physicists ignored the paper\ncompletely for 5-10 years; others assumed it was merely an\nelaboration of Lorentz's prior work.\nThose few who did pay attention did so from within their own\ncontexts. Different aspects of Einstein's paper seemed more or\nless relevant to them.\nMinkowski re-interpreted Einstein's paper in terms of space-time geometry. Cunningham and\nBateman re-interpreted the paper in terms of properties of differential equations and inversion\nproperties of their solutions.\nNone of these readers seemed to care much about was most important to Einstein: that\nthe ether was \"merely superfluous,\" and that, following Ernst Mach, one should start with\nkinematics instead of dynamics.

In 1887, at the urging of\nscientists and engineers, the government founded the\nPhysikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt* (PTR) to foster research at the\nintersections of basic science, applied research, and industrial\ndevelopment. (Akin to the U.S. Bureau of Standards, now the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST].)\nPhysikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt\n(PTR), Berlin, ca. 1900\nEarly, pressing challenge: evaluate\ncompeting proposals for large-scale\nelectric street lighting.\n*Imperial Physical-Technical Institute\n\nBlackbody Radiation\nWhen an object is heated to a high enough temperature, it will\nglow. The color of the emitted light shifts with the temperature to\nwhich the object has been heated.\nGlowing embers in a fireplace\nedsuom\nWhile working on calibrations for various electric lighting proposals,\nresearchers at the PTR noted a \"universal glow\": the pattern of light emitted\nfrom various objects when they were heated to sufficiently high temperatures\nseemed to be independent of the composition of those materials.\nThey postulated that for an ideal \"blackbody\" -- an object that absorbed\nall light that fell upon it, reflecting none -- there might exist a single, universal\nLummer and Pringsheim,\nblackbody spectrum, 1890s\nspectrum, or pattern of the intensity of light emitted at various wavelengths.\n\nBlackbody Radiation\nThe universal blackbody spectrum seemed interesting for at least two\nreasons: it could be useful for industrial calibrations and standardization, and it\nmight offer clues about fundamental interactions between light and matter.\nSo PTR researchers collected more and more data on emissions from\n(near) blackbodies throughout the 1880s and 1890s.\n!\nT2\nT1\nT3\npeak emission rises.\n\"\nT1 < T2 < T3\nAs the temperature rises, the\nintensity of the emitted light\nrises and the frequency of the\nu ( , T): energy density, how\nmuch energy was radiated per\nvolume per frequency .\nLummer and Pringsheim,\nblackbody spectrum, 1890s\nImage is in the public domain.\n\nBlackbody Radiation\nAs the empirical pattern of the blackbody spectrum was becoming\nmore clear, how to explain that pattern was becoming more puzzling.\nMax Planck was following the developments at the PTR closely.

He knew\nnot only that the u( ,T) curve must fall with increasing ; he had empirical\nevidence about how sharply the curve actually fell. So he began to tinker.\nOn December 14, 1900, he presented a paper to the German Physical\nSociety:\n!\n\"\nh: a new, universal\nconstant, now known\nas \"Planck's constant.\"\nLummer and Pringsheim,\nblackbody spectrum, 1890s\nImage is in the public domain.\n\nThe Quantum Scale\nIn his 1900 treatment of blackbody radiation, Planck introduced a new universal constant, h.\nIt set the scale for departures from physical descriptions based solely on Newton's or Maxwell's\nequations.\nh = 6.261 x 10-27 erg-seconds\nerg: a unit of energy\nOn the scale of human-sized objects, h is incredibly small:\n1 erg = 1 g cm2 / s2\nDrop a grape from 5 cm: E\nt ~ 1028 h\nFly buzzing your head: |L| ~ 1028 h\nImages (c) sources unknown.

For more information, see https://\nocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use/\n\nThe Origin of Quantum Theory?\nScientists typically say that Planck launched a new \"quantum\nrevolution\" with his work in 1900. In modern derivations, we arrive at\nPlanck's expression for u( ,T) by stipulating that the energy exchanged\nbetween matter and radiation must be quantized, in units E = h , rather\nthan treated as continuous. Is that what Planck thought he was doing?\nKuhn: In Planck's 1900 derivation, he fixed the total energy of the system to\nbe an integer number of units of h ,\nbut he did not require Ei = h . In fact, in Planck's description, the energies for sub-systems fell\n\"in the range (Ei, Ei + Ei).\" Planck used bins of size = h for his accounting, but then\ncounted how many oscillators of continuous energy fell within bins [0, ], [ , 2 ], and so on.\nIn his 1906 lectures, Planck still spoke of continuous (rather than quantized) energy exchange.\n(The debate continues: see M. Nauenberg, American Journal of Physics 84 (2016): 709-720.)\n\nThe Origin of Quantum Theory?\nbut he did not require Ei = h .

Nauenberg, American Journal of Physics 84 (2016): 709-720.)\n\nQuestions?\n\nPhotoelectric Effect\nIn 1900, Planck had been concerned with the interaction between light\nand matter, not the propagation of light on its own. In 1905, Einstein\nbegan to think about the nature of light itself.\nMarch 1905: light quanta\nMay 1905: Brownian motion\nJune 1905: special relativity\nSeptember 1905: E = mc2\nEinstein at the Patent Office,\nIn particular, he was trying to make sense of recent experimental\nresults (1902) from Philipp Lenard on the ejection of electrons from a\nmetal plate, when high-energy radiation shines on it.\n\nPhotoelectric Effect\nA\nUV\nIn his experiments, Lenard applied a tunable voltage V across\nconducting plates. When one of the plates was irradiated with\nultraviolet light (UV), electrons were ejected and traveled to the\nother plate, completing a circuit (hence current was measured in\nthe ammeter A). By adjusting the voltage, Lenard could measure\nhow much energy the electrons had upon being ejected from the\nplate (\"stopping voltage\"), and compare that with the frequency of\nthe radiation that had shone onto the plate.\ne\nV\nE of\nejected\nelectrons\nLenard's data indicated that there was\nsome threshold frequency, below which no\nelectrons were ejected. Above that\nfrequency, the electrons' energy rose linearly\nwith the frequency of incident light, but was\nindependent of the intensity of the light.\nof incident light\n\nPhotoelectric Effect\nWhy were Lenard's results puzzling?\nE of\nAccording to Maxwell's work, the energy carried by a\nejected\nelectrons\nlight wave is proportional to its intensity:\nSo why couldn't Lenard's device eject electrons with\nof incident light\nhigh-intensity light of low frequency? If light acted like\nMaxwellian waves, there should be no threshold frequency\n0 in the photoelectric experiments.\nLikewise, according to Maxwell's work, the energy imparted to the electrons that were\nejected should have been proportional to the light wave's intensity, with no particular\ndependence on the light's frequency.\n\nPhotoelectric Effect\nIn what he considered the \"most radical\" of his papers\nof 1905, Einstein offered a \"heuristic\"* explanation of\nthe photoelectric effect: What if light itself were quantized?\n\"It seems to me that the observations about [...] the\nproduction of cathode rays by ultraviolet light [...] are more\nreadily understood if one assumes that the energy of light is\ndiscontinuously distributed in space. [As suggested here,] the\nenergy of a light ray spreading out from a point source is not\ncontinuously distributed over an increasing space but consists\nof a finite number of energy quanta which are localized at points in\nspace, which move without dividing, and which can only be\nproduced and absorbed as complete units.\"\n* heuristic means \"suggestive,\" worth considering, not definitive.\n\nwhere\n(the \"work function\" of the metal) characterized how tightly electrons were bound to\ntheir atoms in the plate.\nThe threshold frequency was then given by\n0 = /h : only when each incoming light\nquantum had sufficient energy would electrons overcome the work function and be ejected.\nPhotoelectric Effect\nE of\nejected\nelectrons\nof incident light\nslope: h\nwas very close to Planck's new constant, h.\nIf each light quantum carried energy\nthen following a collision with an electron in\nthe metal plate, the electron would acquire\nenergy\n\nPhotoelectric Effect\nE of\nejected\nelectrons\nof incident light\nslope: h\nEinstein suggested: the light shining on the\nmetal plate was not like an extended,\ncontinuous wave washing up on shore, but like\na shower of marbles, each of which could\ncollide with electrons in the metal.\nLight\nSo: everyone was convinced, right? Enormous skepticism\nabout the light-quantum hypothesis for ~15 years.\nelectrons in the\nmetal were like\nping pong balls\ntrapped in a\nbucket\nEinstein also re-derived Planck's blackbody formula\nfor u( , T), assuming the radiation consisted of a gas\nof individual particles with energies E = h .\nPingpong balls, marbles (c) sources unknown.

But\nthis led to new questions:\nElectrons would be constantly accelerated as\nthey moved around the nucleus. According\nto Maxwell's electromagnetic work,\naccelerated charges should radiate. Where is\nall that light?\nEven more important: the electrons\nshould lose energy as they radiated. So why\ndidn't electrons quickly crash into the\nnucleus? Why is matter stable at all?\nRutherford model of the atom: massive\nnucleus in the center with positive charge;\nlightweight electrons surrounding it, with\nnegative charge.\n\nQuestions?\n\nBohr Model\nNiels Bohr was a young Danish physicist, who was a\npostdoc in Rutherford's group between 1911-1913.\nHe was fascinated by the new Rutherford model of\natomic structure, but also puzzled by the question of\nthe stability of matter.\nBohr aimed to account for atomic structure from\nfirst principles, with a goal of accounting for all the\nBohr's notes (1913) on atomic and molecular structure\nelements of the periodic table.\nHe began by considering electrostatic repulsion\nand magnetic effects among electrons in multi-electron\natoms and molecules, seeking equilibrium configurations.\nPerhaps such balanced configurations could account\nfor why matter was stable.\n\nBohr Model\nWhen that proved cumbersome, he turned to the simplest case of a\nhydrogen atom, with a single electron. Again for simplicity, he considered\na circular orbit. By balancing the forces, he could solve for the electron's\nvelocity. In these expressions, both ! and r were continuous variables.\nNext he imposed a new \"quantum condition,\" that the electron's\norbital angular momentum could only take specific values. He was\ninspired by Planck and (especially) Einstein, who had emphasized\nn = 1, 2, 3, ... ,\ndiscreteness at a scale set by Planck's constant h.\nNow Bohr had two expressions for !; equating them, he could solve for r. The allowable radii for\nelectron orbits were now discrete:\n\"Bohr radius\":\n\nBohr Model\n+\nDiscrete orbits\na0\n4a0\n9a0\nAgain starting with classical expressions, Bohr next\ncalculated the energy of an electron in such an orbit:\n\nBohr Model\n+\na0\n4a0\n9a0\nThen the energy difference between discrete electron orbits would be:\nNow Bohr got excited! Balmer spectrum from excited hydrogen atoms:\nR: \"Rydberg constant\"\nBohr proposed: light would be emitted whenever an electron jumped\nfrom an \"excited\" orbit to a lower-energy orbit: %E = h&, or:\nJohann\nBalmer,\n\nBohr Model\nBohr was reluctant to publish his new ideas, because he had only\ntreated hydrogen atoms; his goal had been to account for the\nstability and structure of all the atoms of the periodic table!\nHappily, Rutherford convinced Bohr to publish anyway (1913).\nCentral to Bohr's explanation was the new \"quantum condition\"\n(J = n!), which restricted electrons to discrete orbits (r = n2a0); only\nfor those choices of r would the atom remain stable. Bohr had\nneither derived nor explained the origin of his proposed \"quantum\ncondition,\" but by using it he had been able to reproduce the\nBalmer spectrum for hydrogen.\nThe question still remained: why didn't this discreteness appear\nin ordinary experience? Bohr worked out the \"correspondence\nprinciple\": in the limit of large quantum numbers, n >> 1, quantum\nsystems should reproduce classical behavior.\n\nBohr's Correspondence Principle\nAccording to Maxwell's electrodynamics, &radiation should be equal to\n&mechanical, the frequency of the mechanical motion of the moving charge:\nAccording to Bohr's atomic model, &radiation is given by the energy difference\nbetween discrete electron orbits:\nfor transitions between neighboring\nstates n1 and n2 = n1 + 1, for n1 >> 1.\n\nr\nBohr's Correspondence Principle\nAccording to Maxwell's electrodynamics, & adiation should be equal to\n&mechanical, the frequency of the mechanical motion of the moving charge:\nr\nAccording to Bohr's atomic model, & adiation is given by the energy difference\nbetween discrete electron orbits:\nfor transitions between neighboring\nstates n1 and n2 = n1 + 1, for n1 >> 1.\n\nBohr Model\nThe Bohr model further developed Rutherford's model\nof atomic structure, and successfully accounted for the\nBalmer spectrum of hydrogen. But several questions\nremained:\n- It only seemed to work for single-electron atoms (H, He+,\nLi++).\n- Why quantize angular momentum, J = n!?\n- What happened to electrons between stable orbits?\n- What determined when an electron would \"jump\" between\norbits?\n- How did an electron \"know\" what energy h& to radiate as\nlight, before landing at a different stable orbit?\n- How to account for the relative intensities of spectral lines?\n\nQuestions?\n\nde Broglie's Hypothesis\nIn his 1924 Ph.D. dissertation, a French aristocrat, Louis de Broglie, offered a hypothesis to account for\nBohr's strange quantum condition, J = n!. He began with Einstein's work on photons (which had\nrecently been set on a more solid footing, given Arthur Compton's X-ray scattering results):\nThen de Broglie simply asserted that the\nsame relation should hold for matter:\n~ 10-11 m ~ a0:\nFor a thrown baseball, ' baseball ~ 10-32 m, totally unobservable on human scales. But ' electron\nfor an electron, the \"waviness\" was on the same scale as the electron's own orbit.\nWhat if stable\nelectron orbits arose\nfrom constructive\ninterference of the\ncorresponding waves?\nconstructive interference\ndestructive interference\n\nde Broglie Waves\nIn 1927, Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer, at Bell\nmoveable\nLabs, found electron scattering results consistent\nwith the concept of de Broglie waves: the scattered\nintensity showed a distinctive interference pattern.\nincident\nelectron beam\nscattered\nelectron beam\ndetector\ncrystal of Nickel\n$\n\n\"Old Quantum Theory\"\nBetween 1900 - 1924, physicists dramatically reassessed their assumptions about light and\nmatter. In contrast with the great triumph of 19th century physics -- the wave theory of light --\nseveral physicists began to explore discrete or particle-like attributes of light (blackbody radiation,\nEinstein's light-quantum hypothesis, and Compton scattering). Meanwhile, de Broglie could only\nsalvage Bohr's new \"quantum condition,\" J = n!, by suggesting that matter had wave-like\nproperties.\nBy the early 1920s, each of the successes of the emerging quantum theory seemed\nto follow a pattern: begin with classical expressions for force or energy, and then\nappend some new, unexplained \"quantum condition\" (E = h& or J = n! or ' = h/p).\nThough many of these models could account for (otherwise puzzling) experimental\nresults, it was not clear whether each new model for a given phenomenon was\nconsistent with other (equally ad hoc) models.\nQuantum theory seemed to many physicists to have become a disorganized grab-\nbag of heuristic guesses and disjointed models, united only by their invocation of\nPlanck's constant h and some sort of conceptual break with 19th century physics.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.042J / 8.225J Einstein, Oppenheimer, Feynman: Physics in the 20th Century\nFall 2020\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

But there was also evidence of an \"anomalous\" Zeeman effect: doublets!\nOne of Sommerfeld's students, Wolfgang Pauli, worked on the\nchallenge while a postdoc with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen in the\nEmission line, no external B field\nearly 1920s.\nEmission lines in the presence of an external B field\n\"A colleague who met me strolling rather aimlessly in the\nbeautiful streets of Copenhagen said to me in a friendly manner,\n'You look very unhappy'; whereupon I answered fiercely, 'How\ncan one look happy when he is thinking about the anomalous\nZeeman effect?' \"\n- Pauli recollections\nImage is in the public domain.\nCopenhagen ca. 1900\n\n\"Anomalous\" Zeeman Effect\nGraduate students of Hendrik Lorentz in Leiden, George\nUhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit, were also working on the\nanomalous Zeeman effect.\nThey reasoned that the Earth has two kinds of\nangular momentum: it orbits the Sun (Keplerian\nelliptical orbit), and it spins on its own axis (day/night).\nIf the electron had an intrinsic \"spin\" S (akin to the\nEarth's rotation around its own axis), and that spin\nwere quantized,\nthen the electron would have an additional magnetic\nmoment:\n\n\"Anomalous\" Zeeman Effect\nGoudsmit and Uhlenbeck then argued as Sommerfeld had\ndone: in an external B field,\n. If the \"spin\" could\nEmission line, no external B field\nonly ever line up parallel or antiparallel to B, then there should be\ndoublets of various spectral lines, whose separation depended on\n|S| = ħ/2. They called this \"space quantization\": the spin vector\nEmission lines in the presence of an external B field\ncould only point along discrete directions in space.\nBy fixing the magnitude |S| = ħ/2, they found a close match to Zeeman's results. But with a\n(conceptual) price: with that magnitude of |S|, a point on the electron's equator would be spinning faster\nthan the speed of light, and its mass would diverge. By 1924, such a value of spin -- if imagined as a real,\nphysical motion -- seemed absurd; the effect seemed impossible to visualize.\nTheir advisor, Lorentz, cautioned them not to publish. But their other advisor, Paul Ehrenfest, had\nalready sent their paper to a journal without telling them! \"You're still young enough to afford a\nstupidity,\" he explained.*\n*By today's standards, Ehrenfest's actions were totally unethical. Advisors today would put\ntheir own name on the paper and then submit it to a journal, behind their students' backs...\n\n\"Anomalous\" Zeeman Effect\nIndependent of Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck, Wolfgang Pauli\nintroduced his \"exclusion principle\" early in 1925.\nFollowing his own advisor, Arnold Sommerfeld, Pauli considered\nadding a fourth quantum number, ns, which (like the other ni) could\nonly take on certain discrete values.\nHe argued that if this fourth quantum number had a \"classically\nindescribable double-valuedness\" (i.e., could only take on 2 values), then\none could account for the anomalous Zeeman effect as well as other\nfeatures of atomic structure.\nImage is in the public domain.\nThis became known as the Pauli exclusion principle:\nelectrons in an atom must be described by four\nquantum numbers (nr, nj, ml, ns), and no two\nelectrons can have the same set of quantum numbers\nat the same time.\nPauli later claimed to have been inspired by the precision of Can-Can dancers,\nwho always managed to get out of each other's spot at the last moment.\nCopenhagen ca. 1900\n\nQuestions?\n\nHeisenberg and Matrix Mechanics\nHeisenberg, \"On the quantum-theoretical\nreinterpretation of kinematic and\nmechanical relationships,\" 1925\nOne of Pauli's close friends, Werner Heisenberg -- another recent PhD\nstudent of Sommerfeld's -- shared Pauli's frustration with the approach of\ntrying to find visualizable, classical models and then appending ad hoc\n\"quantum conditions.\" In 1924, Heisenberg began a postdoc position with\nNiels Bohr in Copenhagen.\nHeisenberg sought a new \"quantum mechanics\": a first-principles treatment\nof the atomic realm, rather than a kludge. He sought to break the impasse\nof the Bohr-Sommerfeld approach by returning to Einstein's (Machian)\npositivism of 1905: we can never observe an electron in its orbit within an\natom, so we should stop trying to calculate atomic properties on the basis of\nquasi-classical orbits.\nImage is in the public domain.\n\nHeisenberg and Matrix Mechanics\nHeisenberg, \"On the quantum-theoretical\nreinterpretation of kinematic and\nmechanical relationships,\" 1925\nOne of Pauli's close friends, Werner Heisenberg -- another recent PhD\nstudent of Sommerfeld's -- shared Pauli's frustration with the approach of\ntrying to find visualizable, classical models and then appending ad hoc\n\"quantum conditions.\" In 1924, Heisenberg began a postdoc position with\nNiels Bohr in Copenhagen.\n\"It seems sensible to discard all hope of observing\nhitherto unobservable quantities [like an electron's orbit].\nInstead it seems more reasonable to try to establish a\ntheoretical quantum mechanics, analogous to classical\nmechanics, but in which only relations between observable\nquantities appear.
