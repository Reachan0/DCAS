  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 session / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nThe course will consider optimization models for supporting the following issues:\n\nDistribution Systems Planning\n\nFacility Sizing and Capacity Expansion\n\nInventory Planning\n\nNetwork Design\n\nProduction Planning and Scheduling\n\nProject Scheduling\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nPortfolio Optimization\n\nPricing\n\nYield Management and Revenue Optimization\n\nCourse Organization\n\nThe course uses a combination of lectures, case discussions, selected readings, an accompanying textbook, hands-on projects and optimization challenges. It introduces some personal and industrial strength software packages, particularly the EXCEL spreadsheet package with its optimization provisions (its solver module) and the AMPL/CPLEX system for modeling and optimization.\n\nText\n\nThe texts\nDecision Modeling with Microsoft Excel, Sixth Edition\nby Moore, Weatherford, Eppen, Gould and Schmidt, Prentice Hall and\nAMPL A Modeling Language For Mathematical Programming\nby Fourer, Gay, Kernighan, Boyd & Fraser, are useful references both for the course material and the modeling tools we will rely on. We will provide additional material as the course progresses.\n\nCourse Project\n\nThis course involves a group project that provides us with an opportunity to consider topics that might not otherwise be covered in the course and to tailor the course offerings for your own interests. It also provides an opportunity for you to dig deeper into areas of special interest. You will work on this project with a team of four or five. Each team must consist of both on-campus and off-campus members. The general intent of your project is to teach yourself and the rest of us about some aspect of optimization. Potential topics include: existing optimization applications special to your company or industry, opportunities for optimization in your company or industry, special optimization tools or methodologies your company or industry uses or is considering, etc.\n\nGrading\n\nGrading will be based on several challenges, two exams and the team-based project:\n\nActivities\n\nPercentages\n\nExam I\n\n25%\n\nExam II\n\n25%\n\nChallenges\n\n25%\n\nTeam Project\n\n25%",

The ores from the different mines contain different levels of these three components.\nBelow (next page) is an Solver Model with optimum solution yielding a contribution margin of\n$30,500,000 as well as a Sensitivity report. Note the quantities of Blend produced and ores used are in\nthousands of tons.\nA. After solving the problem, the company learns it can have up to another 3,000 tons of ore from\nmine T1 at the standard price of $800/ton. One manager claims that since the shadow price on the\nconstraint stipulating the limit on the ore available from mine T1 is 0, Eastern Steel should not\npurchase more ore. Is this correct?\nB.\nSuppose the constraint limiting the total tons of ore available were removed and the problem was\nre-solved (keeping the available tons of ore from mine T1 at 21,000).\nWhat would the shadow price on the constraint limiting the available ore from Mine T1 be?\nWhat would the shadow price on the constraint limiting the available ore from Mine T2 be?\n\nProduct\nBlend\nT1\nQty.

In solving an integer programming problem, Solver and CPLEX solve a linear programming\nrelaxation obtained by ignoring the integrality conditions on all of the variables and then round the\ninteger variables to integral values.\nc. The set of feasible solutions to a linear program describes a convex set.\nd. The set of feasible solutions to an integer program describes a convex set.\ne. The set of feasible solutions to a non-linear program describes a convex set.\nf.\nLinear functions are convex functions\ng. Linear functions are concave functions\nh. Quadratic functions are convex functions.\ni.\nIf a real valued function f is a convex function then the function g(x) = 1-f(x) is a convex function\nj.

The problem need not be linear.\nIndicate all the guaranteed relations between the following values:\n1. The optimum objective value\n2. The objective value of a feasible solution\n3. The optimum objective value of the problem in which we relax the integrality constraints\n4. The optimum objective value of the problem in which we fix the values of some of the integer\nvariables.\n5.

This is intended to be part of a larger, more\ncomplicated model so the fact that we can solve the problem easily is irrelevant -- we are only talking\nabout a small piece of the problem.\nThere are N items numbered 1, 2, N. If we choose item i, we earn r[i]. If we select exactly one of the\nitems, we must pay b. We don't pay b if we chose two or more or if we don't choose any. We want to\nmaximize net revenue. You may introduce other variables if you wish. You will certainly need to add an\nobjective and constraints.\nparam N;\n# the number of items.\nparam r{1..N};\n# the revenue on each item\n# the cost incurred if we choose exactly one of the items\nparam b;\nvar x{1..N} binary; # x[i] is one if we choose item i and 0 otherwise."

Answer each of the following\nquestions arising during the discussions (arguments) based on the information in the following\nSensitivity Report (see the next page)\na) What are the basic variables in this optimal solution? This is a balanced network flow problem\nwith 8 constraints (4 VP constraints and 4 plant constraints), so there are 7 basic variables.

Is this the only optimal solution? Explain your answer.\nThis is the unique optimal solution because no NON-BASIC variable has zero reduced cost.\nc) The VP of Operations attended Ecole des Mines de Nancy and would like to have a chance to\nreturn to the campus. He is trying to convince the President that the cost of his going to Nancy is\nless than the estimated cost of 17. He must convince the President to reduce his estimate of this\ncost by how much?\nIf we send the VP of Operations to Nancy, the total cost of the solution rises by 1 (that's what the\nreduced cost says). So, to break even, he must convince the President to reduce the cost estimate by 1\nto $16.\nd) Which VP's time is most valuable? We measure the value of a VP's time based on the reduction in\nthe cost of the optimal assignments we would obtain if we convince a second VP to visit 2 sites so\n\nthe VP in question does not need to visit any. The greater the reduction in cost, the more valuable\nthe VP's time.\nBy our definition the VP with the highest shadow price on the Plants Assigned constraint is the one\nwhose time is most valuable. We would prefer he stays at home. That's the VP of Operations with\nshadow price 0.\n\nMicrosoft Excel 8.0a Sensitivity Report\nWorksheet: [01AssignmentModel.xls]Sheet1\nReport Created: 12/18/01 4:29:06 PM\nAdjustable Cells\nFinal Reduced\nObjective\nAllowable Allowable\nCell\nName\nValue\nCost\nCoefficient\nIncrease\nDecrease\n$B$15 Finance (F) Leipzig\n1E+30\n$C$15 Finance (F) Nancy\n$D$15 Finance (F) Liege\n1E+30\n$E$15 Finance (F) Tilburg\n$B$16 Marketing (M) Leipzig\n1E+30\n$C$16 Marketing (M) Nancy\n1E+30\n$D$16 Marketing (M) Liege\n1E+30\n$E$16 Marketing (M) Tilburg\n1E+30\n$B$17 Operations (O) Leipzig\n$C$17 Operations (O) Nancy\n1E+30\n$D$17 Operations (O) Liege\n1E+30\n$E$17 Operations (O) Tilburg\n1E+30\n$B$18 Personnel (P) Leipzig\n$C$18 Personnel (P) Nancy\n1E+30\n$D$18 Personnel (P) Liege\n$E$18 Personnel (P) Tilburg\nConstraints\nFinal\nShadow Constraint Allowable Allowable\nCell\nName\nValue\nPrice\nR.H.

To find these paths you should only need to\nsolve a single network flow model. The credit you receive on this model will depend in\npart on the size of the problem you formulate. For example, simply combining several\nseparate shortest path models into one objective will not receive full credit.

Does this mean that all the optimal solutions to\na given network flow problem must be a basic feasible solution?\nNo. In the case of alternative optimum solutions, for example, the optimum solutions\nwe obtain by increasing the value of a non-basic variable with zero reduced cost are not\nbasic solutions.\n(b) What are the three possible conclusions Solver can reach regarding the solutions to\na given network flow problem?\n1. The problem has a finite optimum solution\n2. The problem admits no feasible solutions\n3. The problem admits feasible solutions, but none is optimal as the objective function\nvalue is unbounded.\n(c) How many basic variables will there be in a basic feasible solution to an\nAssignment Problem like Auto power's, but with 5 Vice Presidents and 5 plants to\naudit?\nThis refers to the original assignment problem, which is balanced. Since there are 10\nconstraints, there will be 10 -1 or 9 basic variables.\n(d) Consider again an Assignment Problem like Auto power's, but with 5 Vice\nPresident's and 5 plants to audit.

Note too the different points assigned to each question. Don't get bogged down on a\nproblem worth few points until you have answered the problems that are worth more. If\nyou are having difficulty with a question, you might wish to pass over it and return to it\nlater if you have enough time at the end of the exam.\nThe exam is open book: you may use any notes or text material.\nThe exam is to be done individually, without collaboration with anyone else.\nYou may use a computer to view your notes, but you may NOT use it to formulate or\nsolve models.\nGood luck!!!\n\nProblem 1 (25 points)\nConsider our model for scheduling postal workers to 5 day shifts:\nMinimize z = MF + TS + WSu + ThM + FT + SW + SuTh\nSubject to\nMF +\nThM + FT + SW + SuTh ≥ 17\nMF + TS +\nFT + SW + SuTh ≥ 13\nMF + TS + WSu +\nSW + SuTh ≥ 15\nMF + TS + WSu + ThM +\nSuTh ≥ 19\nMF + TS + WSu + ThM + FT\n≥ 14\nTS + WSu + ThM + FT + SW\n≥ 16\nWSu + ThM + FT + SW + SuTh ≥ 11\nNon-negativity\nHere, MF for example, is the number of workers assigned to the shift that starts on\nMonday and runs through Friday. Note that this model allows a worker to be assigned to\na shift and only dedicate a fraction of his efforts to the tasks that make up the\nrequirements. Workers like these dedicate the remainder of their efforts to, say, and\nstrategic projects.\nA. (10 points) After solving this problem, the postmaster sees that he will need a\nstaff of at least 23 full time equivalents (22 just isn't enough). He argues that the\nonly way to reduce this is to find ways to reduce the demand on the peak day,\nThursday. Is this really the only way to reduce the total staffing required? To be\nspecific, can we reduce the total staffing requirements by reducing the\nrequirements of any single day EXCEPT Thursday by a single worker?\nNo. The shadow prices and allowable decreases for the constraints on Monday,\nWednesday, Thursday and Saturday all indicate that we can reduce total requirements\nby 0.333 workers if we reduce the requirements on any one of these days by 1.\nB. (10 points) One very senior worker insists on having Fridays and Saturdays off.\nProvide an estimate of the impact on the total workforce required if we\naccommodate his request? Discuss briefly the thinking behind your estimate.\nWe don't have any workers scheduled for the Sunday-Thursday shift, so we can't just\nswap this worker onto that shift. Instead, to accommodate him, we must put him on\nthis shift. The reduced cost of 0 on the Sunday-Thursday shift suggests doing this will\nnot increase the total staffing requirements, but we may not be able to increase our\nassignments to this shift by one full unit.\nC. (5 points) Is the solution shown below the unique (i.e., the only) optimal solution\nto this problem?\nNo. The non-basic variable Sunday-Thursday has reduced cost 0 and the current\nsolution is non-degenerate (no basic variable is zero). So we can shift some staff to\nSunday-Thursday at no cost. [The basic variables are: The 5 shifts we assign staff to\n\ntogether with the slack variables on the constraints for staffing on Tuesday and\nFriday.\nThe Spreadsheet model and sensitivity information are shown below.\nShift\nMon-Fri Tues-Sat Wed-SunThu-Mon Fri-Tue Sat-Wed Sun-Thu Total\nAssigments 6.333333\n5 0.3333337.333333\n03.333333\n0 22.33333\nDay of Week\nWorkers\nRequired\nMonday\n17>=\nTuesday\n1 14.66667>=\nWednesday\n15>=\nThursday\n19>=\nFriday\n19>=\nSaturday\n16>=\nSunday\n11>=\nMicrosoft Excel 9.0 Sensitivity Report\nWorksheet: [PostalSchedule.xls]Sheet1\nReport Created: 2/26/2003 3:20:37 PM\nAdjustable Cells\nFinal\nReduced\nObjective Allowable\nAllowable\nCell\nName\nValue\nCost\nCoefficient Increase\nDecrease\n$B$3 Assigments Mon-Fri\n6.333333333\n$C$3 Assigments Tues-Sat\n$D$3 Assigments Wed-Sun 0.333333333\n$E$3 Assigments Thu-Mon 7.333333333\n0.5\n$F$3 Assigments Fri-Tue\n00.333333333\n1E+300.333333333\n$G$3 Assigments Sat-Wed 3.333333333\n0.5\n$H$3 Assigments Sun-Thu\n1E+30\nConstraints\nFinal\nShadow\nConstraint Allowable\nAllowable\nCell\nName\nValue\nPrice\nR.H.

(10 points) Describe the differences, if any, between the concepts of Shadow\nPrices and Reduced Costs.\nShadow prices give us sensitivity information related to the constraints. In\nparticular, the shadow price for a constraint is the rate of change in the objective\nas we increase the right-hand-side of the constraint.\nReduced costs give us sensitivity information related to the variables. In\nparticular, the reduced cost of a variable is the amount by which we must improve\nthe objective coefficient before that variable will be attractive. Equivalently, the\nreduced cost of a non-basic variable is the rate of change in the objective as we\nincrease the activity of that variable and adjust the values of the basic variables to\nmaintain feasibility.\nThe two are related in that given the shadow prices, the process of pricing out\ngives us the reduced costs.\nB. (10 points) Describe the differences, if any, between the concepts of Basic\nVariables and Non-basic Variables.\nNon-basic variables are fixed at 0 (or, more generally at a bound) in a basic\nfeasible solution. The values of the basic variables are uniquely determined by the\nresulting constraints. Thus the basic variables are the only variables whose values\ncan differ from 0 (or more generally a bound) in a basic feasible solution.\nTying this to question A. The shadow prices for a basic feasible solution are\ndetermined so that the reduced costs of basic variables are zero. In this way, the\nreduced costs of non-basic variables represent how attractive they are relative to\nthe basic variables. If none of the non-basic variables is attractive, then the basic\nfeasible solution is an optimal solution.\n\nC. (10 points) Describe the relationships, if any, between the concepts of Network\nFlow Problems and Linear Programming Problems.\nNetwork flow problems are the special case of Linear Programming Problems in\nwhich every variable appears in at most two constraints (not counting bounds). Further,\neach variable must appear in at most one constraint with a +1 coefficient and at most one\nconstraint with a -1 coefficient. No other coefficients are allowed. The general form of a\nnetwork flow problem is:\nSet NODES;\nSet EDGES within NODES cross NODES;\nParam C{EDGES};\nParam UpperBound{EDGES};\nParam LowerBound{EDGES};\nParam Supply{NODES}:\nVar X{EDGES};\nMin Cost:\nSum{(f,t) in EDGES} C[f,t]*X[f,t];\ns.t.

LowerBounds{(f,t) in EDGES}:\nX[f,t] >= LowerBound[f,t];\n\nProblem 3 (20 points)\nIndicate which of the following are best described as a\n1. Network Flow Model,\n2. Linear Programming Model,\n3. Neither of the above. In this case explain briefly what prevents the formulation from being a\nLinear Programming Model\nA.

FullyInvested:\nsum{f in FUNDS} Invest[f] = 1;\nComment: Note the use of absolute value (|x| = max{x, -x}) in the objective.\nB.

We could omit it and obtain the same answers because the assignment\nproblem yields integral solutions.\ns.t. GetZerosOrOnes{vp in VPS, p in PLANTS}:\nAssign[vp,p]*Assign[vp,p] = Assign[vp, p];\n\nProblem 4 (25 points)\nAn aircraft part manufacturer TCI provides Stage 2 low pressure compressor (lpc) blades for Pratt &\nWhitney's PW2000 aircraft engines. TCI has a certain number of blades in inventory, purchases new\nblades and reconditions used blades. It can either recondition blades using a rapid, but more expensive\nprocess or by a slower, but more economical process. You may assume that TCI takes newly\npurchased blades out of its supplier's consignment inventory. In other words, newly purchased blades\nare available immediately. These are the only options:\n1. Take blades from existing inventory\n2. Purchase new blades\n3. Recondition blades via the rapid process\n4. Recondition blades via the slower process.\nGenerally, TCI uses some combination of these methods to ensure it meets it customers' needs on\ntime.\nFor simplicity, assume that the customers contract with TCI well in advance and so, based on their\nmaintenance schedules, TCI has an accurate forecast of how many worn blades it will receive and how\nmany replacement blades it must provide each day for several weeks into the future.\nIn general, our objective is to focus on the flow of blades at a macro level to help determine budgets\nand allocate resources over the medium term. We are not concerned with micro decisions about the\nhandling of individual blades. In fact, to simplify your analysis, assume that TCI cannot track the\nidentity of blades coming back from its customers and so has no idea of a blade's previous\nmaintenance history. Further, assume that every returned blade can be successfully reconditioned.\nYou have been asked to develop a network flow model to help TCI with its resource planning.\nA. (10 points) Describe the data you will need from the supplier in order to build your model. Be\nas specific as possible. For example, you will need to know how many days TCI forecasts and\nthe number of blades it expects to receive each day of the forecast. What other information will\nyou want from TCI?\nThere are several possible answers. All should include (perhaps at different time scales):\n- The forecast horizon in days\n- The requirements for blades at each customer on each day of the forecast\n- The number of worn blades each customer will return each day\n- The cost, capacity and duration of the quick reconditioning method\n- The cost, capacity and duration of the slow reconditioning method\n- The cost of new blades\n- The current inventory of blades (and perhaps their status of worn or usable).\n- Cost of inventory\n- Etc.\n\nB. (10 points) Describe in words the different types of edges (or variables or flows) you will\nconsider in your model. For example, your model will include a variable for the number of new\nblades purchased each day.\nAgain, there are several possible answers. All should include (perhaps at different time scales):\n- The number of blades that were returned each day\n- The number of blades in inventory each day (we assume these are all usable)\n- The number of blades quick reconditioned each day\n- The number of blades slow reconditioned each day\n- The number of blades purchased new each day\nC. (5 points) Formulate a network flow model to help TCI. It is best if you can use AMPL-like\nsyntax to describe your model as it is unambiguous. Don't worry about the details of the syntax\nlike semicolons, etc. The point is to provide a clear, unambiguous description of the model. If\nare not able to do this, you may even draw a network flow model instead, but this won't win\nyou full credit naturally.\nIn PseudoAmpl....\nParam Ndays;\nSet DAYS 0..Ndays;\nSet Methods; /* Quick and slow */\nParam Duration{Methods}; /* How long it takes to recondition by each method */\nParam Cost{Methods}; /* $/blade to recondition by each method */\nParam Capacity{Methods}; /* Number of blades we can start each day on each method */\nParam NewCost; /* $/blade */\nParam InvCost; /* $/blade/day */\nParam Supply{DAYS}; /* returned blades on each day */\nParam Demand{DAYS}; /* required blades on each day */\nParam InitInventory;\nVar Recondition{method in Methods, day in DAYS} >= 0, <=Capacity[method]; /* How\nmany blades we recondition by each method each day */\nVar Purchase {DAYS} >= 0; /* How many blades we purchase each day */\nVar Inventory{DAYS}>= 0; /* How many usable blades we hold in inventory */\nMinimize TotalCost:\nSum{day in DAYS} InvCost*Inventory[day] +\nSum{day in DAYS} NewCost*Purchase[day] +\nSum{method in Methods, day in DAYS} Cost[method]*Recondition[method, day];\ns.t.

The President, having gotten his MS at MIT, is a clever fellow and realizes\nhow he can quickly resolve the question. Is this the only optimal solution? Explain\nyour answer.\nThis is the unique optimal solution because no NON-BASIC variable has zero reduced\ncost.\nc) The VP of Operations attended Ecole des Mines de Nancy and would like to have a\nchance to return to the campus. He is trying to convince the President that the cost of\nhis going to Nancy is less than the estimated cost of 17. He must convince the\nPresident to reduce his estimate of this cost by how much?\n\nIf we send the VP of Operations to Nancy, the total cost of the solution rises by 1 (that's\nwhat the reduced cost says). So, to break even, he must convince the President to reduce\nthe cost estimate by 1 to $16.\nd) Which VP's time is most valuable? We measure the value of a VP's time based on the\nreduction in the cost of the optimal assignments we would obtain if we convince a\nsecond VP to visit 2 sites so the VP in question does not need to visit any. The greater\nthe reduction in cost, the more valuable the VP's time.\nBy our definition the VP with the highest shadow price on the Plants Assigned constraint\nis the one whose time is most valuable.

In\nparticular, answer the following three questions. Focus your answers on the issues that\nparticularly relate to decision support systems based on optimization models like the one we\npropose. Eschew truisms, tautologies and other fluff.\nA. (10 points) Describe the data you will need from NASA in order to build your model.

Does this mean that all the optimal solutions to\na given network flow problem must be a basic feasible solution?\nNo. In the case of alternative optimum solutions, for example, the optimum solutions\nwe obtain by increasing the value of a non-basic variable with zero reduced cost are not\nbasic solutions.\n(b) What are the three possible conclusions Solver can reach regarding the solutions to\na given network flow problem?\n1. The problem has a finite optimum solution\n2. The problem admits no feasible solutions\n3. The problem admits feasible solutions, but none is optimal as the objective function\nvalue is unbounded.\n(c) How many basic variables will there be in a basic feasible solution to an\nAssignment Problem like Auto power's, but with 5 Vice Presidents and 5 plants to\naudit?\nThis refers to the original assignment problem, which is balanced. Since there are 10\nconstraints, there will be 10 -1 or 9 basic variables.\n(d) Consider again an Assignment Problem like Auto power's, but with 5 Vice\nPresident's and 5 plants to audit. How many variables will be positive in a basic\nfeasible solution to this problem?\n5. One for each assignment in the solution."

The goal of this study is to explore several service level scenarios\nfor the US market and show the type of distribution network that would be\nrequired to achieve each target.\n\nProject Objectives\nPeach State and PDQ agreed on the following project goals and\nobjectives to ensure success.\ny Examine the historical demand: Build profiles of typical customer orders to understand the\ncurrent network.\ny Project future demand: Identify key markets that will be served in the future.\ny Rate the current network: Detail the service levels that can be achieved with the existing\nfacility.\ny Design a network for the following scenarios:\ny Baseline - Central NJ only\ny How many DC's to reach 100% of the US in 24 hours?\ny Best 1, 2, and 3 DC networks (3 scenarios)\ny Best Central NJ + 1 DC network\ny Best Central NJ + 2 DC network\ny Identify service levels: With each scenario, calculate how many customers can be served in\n1 day, 2 days, or more.\ny Review existing warehouse: Make recommendations around space efficiency and process\nimprovements.\n\nProject Approach & Methodology\nPeach State used historical shipment data and information about\ntarget markets to build a model of PDQ's network.\ny Input Data: PDQ provided detailed information about products, order activity, and shipment\nmethods. The sample data provided covered June 2001 to June 2002.\ny Demand Analysis: Peach State examined the data and built profiles of the typical customer\norder, daily order activity, and shipment method. This data was also used to do a product\nvelocity study which identified the fastest moving products.\ny Customer Location: PDQ provided the BPIA buying power index which describes the\npopulation of office workers in each U.S. county. This data was used to identify the largest\nmetropolitan areas in the U.S. which are important strategic targets for PDQ.\ny Network Modeling: A detailed model of the network was built using the data profiles.\nUsing this model, Peach State located facilities to meet customer demand. This approach\nminimizes distance to the customer base and meets service level targets.\ny Scenario Analysis: A baseline scenario was compared with several other alternatives.\nDetailed maps and service levels are provided for each scenario. These will provide PDQ\nwith a strong foundation for strategic expansion.\n\nDemand Analysis\n\"What does the typical order look like?\"\n\nDemand Analysis\nPeach State used historical data to build profiles of PDQ's\nshipping activity and customer demand.\nData was used to answer key questions:\ny How many orders are received each day?\ny Are sales levels increasing over time?\ny How many shipments are sent via LTL carrier? Parcel carrier?\ny What does the average order look like? How many products?\nAverage sizes? Total weight?\ny Which products are the fastest moving? What percentage of activity\ndo they represent?\n\nOrders per Day\nThe number of orders processed per day fluctuates, but it is most\ncommon to ship 55 to 65 orders per day.\n\nShipment Volumes\nJanuary 2002 marked a step increase in shipment volumes.\n\nActivity Levels Per Day\nThough total volumes\nhave increased, the\nspread of daily orders\nhas remained constant.\n\nParcel shipments constitute the majority of all shipments - more\nShipment Mode\nthan 60%.\n\nLines Per Order Profile\nMore than 50% of all orders were a single line only. Order\npicking can be designed to leverage this for increased efficiency.\n74%\n84%\n89%\n93%\n95%\n96%\n97%\n98%\n98%\n99%\n53%\nLines\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nLines

Slowest Moving Items\nReceiving, Packing, Shipping Area\nOFFICE\nTotal\nFacings\n\nSpace and Process Improvements\nPeach State recommended the following enhancements for the\nexisting warehouse, based on a one day site assessment:\ny\nSlotting\ny Zone the warehouse by velocity--\"A\", fast moving items = front, \"B\" movers = middle, \"C\" & \"Dogs\" = back.\ny Keep fastest moving items toward the dock & on the floor; opportunity exists to re-slot the warehouse.\ny Putaway - store and putaway receipts of product by velocity zone; use first part of shift to replenish floor/forward slots from reserve.\ny Allocate the right amount of product to a forward location; i.e., don't tie up 3 floor slots with same product if slots\nwould be better served with other, fast moving SKU's.\ny Continue to store items that ship together close to one another.\ny\nOperations\ny Adjust workstation layout for packing to minimize travel time between work table, terminal, printers & UPS manifest.\ny Evaluate increasing the size of the UPS waves to create more efficient picking tours; update system parameters as\nneeded.\ny\nStorage\ny Rack out remaining floor space with selective pallet rack, minus space required for staging.\ny Creating deeper bays for longer products will only offer marginal space improvements.\ny Use dense storage for small cube items (e.g., more half pallet locations, bin shelving, &/or case rack).\ny Put mezzanine over shipping docks; returns or small cube items could be processed on mezzanine.\ny Rack out over dock doors to store packing materials and empty pallets.\ny Consolidate dead items on pallet, inventory, ID, and put in back of warehouse.\ny Possibly use floor storage for high cube, stackable items.\nDetailed slotting will yield the greatest operational\nbenefits to PDQ.\n\nSummary of Demand\nThe observations of the demand analysis were used to model\nPDQ's U.S. distribution network.\ny For the purposes of the network study, we assume that customers behave the same no matter\nwhere they live in the U.S. The order size, order value, frequency, and return rates all follow\nthe typical customer profile.\ny The number of daily orders can fluctuate over a wide range. The distribution network must be\nflexible to allow for this variability.\ny Sales have been steadily increasing in the U.S. and this trend should continue as PDQ enters\nnew markets. The distribution network must be able to handle this future growth.\ny Parcel shipments account for over 60% of the customer orders. This has been consistent over\ntime, and is dependent on product type. PDQ must be equally capable of meeting service\ntargets with both parcel and LTL shipments.\ny More than half of the orders are for a single product only, and 80% of the volume is driven by\nthe \"fastest\" one third of products. PDQ should examine its shipping operations to build in\nefficiency. For example, single line orders could be batch picked to reduce travel time. Even\nsmall improvements in order fulfillment methodology could yield significant results.\n\nCustomer Locations\n\"Where are the largest markets?\"\n\ny Office workers\ncustomers.\ny The data includes\nworkers in large,\noffices.\ny Alaska and\nHawaii were\nexcluded from\nthe study: this\nof the total\npopulation.\nworkers in the United States, divided into 3,109 counties.\nGeographic Analysis of Demand\nare PDQ's target\nsmall, and home\nwas only 0.12%\nPDQ provided BPIA data which shows the population of office\n\ny\ndefined by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau.\ny 86 percent of U.S.\noffice workers live\ny\nconsumers tend to\nlive in these metro\nareas also.\ny\neasily focused on\nthese dense areas.\nTo speed calculations, Peach State grouped demand into large\nmetro areas made up of several counties.\nDemand Aggregation\n302 Metro areas are\nin these areas.\nStyle conscious\nMarketing can be\n\ny The network model\nwill focus on the\nlargest cities first.\ny This level of\naggregation allows\nfaster modeling\nresults but does not\naffect validity.\ny Final results will be\nreported using the\nfull 3,109 county\nlist and 100% of the\npopulation.\nareas represent 58 percent of U.S. office workers.\nAnalysis of Demand\nThe largest 50 metro areas are used in the network study. These\n\nAnalysis of Demand\nCustomer orders and returns should follow the same geographic\ndistribution as the population of office workers in the U.S.\nyCalifornia, New York, and Texas have the largest concentration of office workers.\nyThe central area of the U.S. is sparsely populated compared to the coasts.\n\nNetwork Model and Baseline\n\"What service can PDQ provide with its existing distribution\ncenter in central NJ?\"\n\nNetwork Model\nPeach State built a model of PDQ's network based on the\nfollowing assumptions.\ny The network model calculates actual road distances between distribution\ncenters and customers.\ny All customers are assigned to the closest DC.\ny LTL shipments travel 500 miles per day on average.\ny Parcel delivery times are based on UPS Ground service and are quoted in\nbusiness days.\ny The model locates each distribution center to minimize average distance to\nthe customers.\ny Return shipments follow the same pattern as outbound shipments. We\nassume there is a fixed percentage of all orders that will be returned.\n\nBaseline Network\nWith just one distribution center located in New Jersey, PDQ will\nnot be able to meet its service targets nationwide.\n\nThe first\nscenario\nincludes only\nthe existing\nfacility in\ncentral NJ.\nThis scenario\nwas used as\nthe index to\nrate all other\nscenarios.\nBaseline Network\n\nIf PDQ starts marketing to\nthe entire United States,\nonly 29% of LTL volume\nand 20% of parcel volume\nwill be within a one day\nservice area from the\nexisting facility.\nParcel Service Levels\n20%\n15%\n31%\n12%\n22%\n78%\n100%\n20%\n35%\n66%\n1 Days\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n5 Days\nBusiness Days in Transit\nPercent of Customers\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nParcel Service Levels\n20%\n15%\n31%\n12%\n22%\n78%\n100%\n20%\n35%\n66%\n1 Days\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n5 Days\nBusiness Days in Transit\nPercent of Customers\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nLTL Service Levels\n29%\n56%\n73%\n82%\n85%\n99.7%\nHours from DC to Customer\nPercent of Customers\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nWithin 2 Days\nWithin 3 Days\nWithin 1 Day\nWithin 4 Days\nWithin 5 Days\nWithin 6 Days\nLTL Service Levels\n29%\n56%\n73%\n82%\n85%\n99.7%\nHours from DC to Customer\nPercent of Customers\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nWithin 2 Days\nWithin 3 Days\nWithin 1 Day\nWithin 4 Days\nWithin 5 Days\nWithin 6 Days\nBaseline Network\nPDQ uses both LTL and Parcel shipments.

It is\nnot necessary to relocate this facility to increase customer service. However, relocation may\nbe necessary for operational reasons, such as outgrowing the current facility.\ny New Facilities: Adding a second distribution center near Los Angeles would achieve three\nday service levels for 97% of the target customers. Based on the population, shipments from\nthis facility would only represent 25-30% of total U.S. sales volume.\ny Additional Expansion: If higher service levels are required or if sales volumes increase, a\nthird facility could be added to the network. With a third facility, PDQ could provide 2 day\nservice to 93% of the country.\ny Detailed Cost Analysis: A more in depth study would provide a view of PDQ's actual\ndistribution costs. This analysis should consider the transportation, inventory, and operating\ncosts of PDQ's distribution network. PDQ should consider all relevant costs to determine\nwhether a new facility can be justified economically.\ny Inbound Shipments: Without actual cost data, it is not possible to identify the best ports to\nbring products into the U.S. Peach State can provide a framework for these decision for PDQ\nto use in the future.\n\nRecommendations\nAppendix\ny Scenario: Central NJ & Reno\ny Scneario: Central NJ & Las Vegas\ny BPIA Data: 50 Top Metro Areas\n\nInstead of placing a second DC in California, PDQ could locate\nScenario: Central NJ & Reno\nin Reno, NV to share space with its sister company.\n\nScenario: Central NJ & Reno\nThis network is\nless efficient than\nother scenarios\nwith 2 distribution\ncenters. However,\nit is still a\nsignificant\nimprovement over\nthe baseline\nnetwork.\n\nBased on distribution alone, Las Vegas is not the best city for a\nsecond DC. However, other factors may outweigh transportation.\nScenario: Central NJ & Las Vegas\n\nResidents of\npossibly\nincrease in\nsales.\nScenario: Central NJ & Las Vegas\nPDQ's facility\ncosts may be\nless expensive\nin Las Vegas\nthan in the Los\nAngeles area.\nCalifornia\nwould not have\nto pay sale tax,\nprovidin an\n\nService levels in this scenario are similar to other options.\nScenario: Central NJ & Las Vegas\n\nPeach State used the top 50 metro areas to design the U.S. network.\nBPIA Data: Top 50 Metro Areas\n\nPeach State used the top 50 metro areas to design the U.S. network.\nBPIA Data: Top 50 Metro Areas"
