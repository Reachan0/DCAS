  "syllabus_content": "A complete syllabus is presented below in text format. Syllabi for the portions of the course taught by Prof. Stephen Graves or Prof. Jeremie Gallien are available separately in PDF format:\n\nGeneral Information about 15.066J and calendar for first portion of class, taught by Prof. Stephen Graves (\nPDF\n)\n\nInformation and calendar for second portion of class (sessions 19-29), taught by Prof. Jeremie Gallien (\nPDF\n)\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThis part of the syllabus applies to the entire course, especially those portions taught by Prof. Stephen Graves.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe first objective is to introduce modeling, optimization and simulation, as it applies to the study and analysis of manufacturing systems for decision support. The introduction of optimization models and algorithms provide a framework to think about a wide range of issues that arise in manufacturing systems. Probabilistic simulation methods are also a powerful tool for the study, analysis and design of manufacturing systems. The second objective is to expose students to a wide range of applications for these methods and models, and to integrate this material with their introduction to operations management. The third objective is to 'refresh' the student's analytic thinking and background in anticipation of the rest of the Leaders for Manufacturing (LFM) curriculum.\n\nTopics\n\nThe topics to be covered include a subset of the following: linear programming, sensitivity analysis for linear programs, network flow problems, introduction to integer and non-linear programming, Lagrange multipliers, simulation, and computer applications. Examples are drawn from manufacturing processes and manufacturing systems.\n\nText\n\nBaker, Kenneth R.\nOptimization: A Spreadsheet-Based Approach.\nDuxbury Press, 2003.\n\nThe textbook is not yet published but the author and publisher have granted us permission to use the manuscript, based on our commitment to provide some feedback. As the name suggests, the textbook will cover optimization topics. For the simulation component of the class, we will distribute readings and notes.\n\nWe also mention some other very useful books that we have used in prior years:\n\nIntroduction to Mathematical Programming\n, by W. L. Winston, PWS Kent, 1995, which does a great job on algorithms and model formulations;\n\nPractical Management Science\n, by W. L. Winston and S. C. Albright, Duxbury, second edition, 2001, which is excellent in describing a wide range of applications as well as illustrating spreadsheet modeling;\n\nThe Science of Decision Making\n, by E. V. Denardo, Wiley 2002, which was used last year and provides a problem-based approach both to optimization as well as probability applications;\n\nand\nData, Models, and Decisions: The Fundamentals of Management Science\n, by D. Bertsimas and R. Freund, South-Western College Publishing, 2000, which was written for the Sloan MBA core class in Data, Models and Decisions. Indeed, we will use some of the cases and other material from this book.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nGrading will be based on performance on assignments, exams, and class participation.\n\nIndividual:\n\nMidterm (25%)\n\nBook Report (10%)\n\nGroup:\n\nProblem Sets (25%)\n\nGroup Project (30%)\n\nIndividual/Group:\n\nCase Preparations, Class Participation, and Feedback on Text (10%)\n\n15.066J Systems Optimization and Analysis: Simulation Module Outline and Logistics, Cases and Examples\n\nThe following is the syllabus for that portion of 15.066J taught by Prof. Jeremie Gallien, Sessions 19-29.\n\nOutline and Logistics\n\nDigital simulation deals with the design and analysis of computer models in order to gain knowledge about, and optimize real systems. In particular, digital simulation enables numerical experiments that do hold some actual predictive value, but would be too costly, time consuming, risky or just plain impossible to directly conduct on a real system. Simulation can be an extremely powerful tool and is becoming quite widespread (LFM second year internships seem to increasingly involve simulation models!), yet few in industry seem well trained in the design, implementation and interpretation of a useful simulation experiment. The simulation module in 15.066J is an application-oriented introduction to static and dynamic discrete-event simulation for executive decision-making. This module has two primary goals:\n\nDevelop the practical skills necessary to design, implement and analyze discrete-event simulation systems;\n\nCover the basic theory underlying discrete-event simulation methodologies, in order to enable a critical understanding of simulation output in managerial environments and build the foundations necessary to quickly adapt to future advances in simulation technology.\n\nBecause of its first objective, this module involves a sustained workload and many opportunities for hands-on practice. This year we will use two software packages for in-class examples, tutorials and homework assignments throughout the course: Crystal Ball(r) (CB) for static (Monte-Carlo) simulations, and SIMUL8(r) (S8) for dynamic discrete-event simulations (the exact meaning of these terms will be explained in the first lecture). While I have primarily selected these software packages among dozens of others because they are both relatively easy to learn, they also happen to be quite widespread and powerful. For support regarding the actual use and learning of these software packages, you should normally consult the following sources (in this order):\n\nORDER\n\nCRYSTAL BALL(r)\n\nSIMUL8(r)\n\nHelp File (Software Help Menu)\n\nHelp File (Software Help Menu)\n\nUser Manual\n\nUser Manual\n\nOnline FAQ no longer available\n\nOnline Q&A Forum available at\n\nSIMUL8(r) Cafe\n\nTeaching Assistant\n\nTeaching Assistant\n\nProfessor Gallien\n\nProfessor Gallien\n\nHowever, if for some reason you find yourself stuck or struggling for more than 30 minutes and sources 1-3 do not yield any quick answer/fix, please do escalate to sources 4 and 5 at that point (again, the goal is to learn about simulation, not software interface). In addition, the module will contain in-class introduction/demos to both CB and S8, and I have assigned as a required reading for Class 4 the tutorial \"Introduction to SIMUL8(r)\" which I have adapted from some of SIMUL8 Corporation's training material.\n\nThis module consists of 7 lectures and 3 tutorials. The\nschedule\n,\nlist of topics covered\n,\nreading\nand\nhomework assignments\nare listed elsewhere on this web site.\n\nAll assignments may be prepared as part of your regular study group/team (and not beyond!), but you should individually be able to answer questions in class about every part of the work that has been done by your team. The three homework assignments, Introduction to SIMUL8(r) document, Ontario Gateway and Human Genome cases will be posted on the class server, and the readings/assignment ClearPictures, Inc. refers to a mini case described later in the present document. The two Probability / Statistics Review Checklists consist of making sure on your own (or as part of your study group) that you are comfortable with a number of concepts covered earlier this summer in 15.064 Engineering Probability and Statistics before walking into class that day. More specifically before the corresponding classes you should have a good understanding of the following concepts:\n\nProbability / Statistics Review 1 Checklist:\n\ndefinition of continuous and discrete random variables;\n\npdf, cdf;\n\nlaw of large numbers; and\n\nstatistical estimators of mean and variance;\n\nProbability / Statistics Review 2 Checklist:\n\ncentral limit theorem;\n\nfractile of a distribution; and\n\nconstruction of confidence intervals for the mean.\n\nDon't skip this! Besides helping you and the class as a whole to make the most out of the simulation lecture that day, it is also a great opportunity to ensure that you have internalized these important concepts covered in 15.064, which should prove useful to you time and time again at MIT and beyond.\n\nAn important milestone in the module is the software implementation of the ClearPictures model on Class 4: this assignment represent the first time in the module that you will have the opportunity to implement a somewhat realistic discrete-event simulation model. It has been partly designed to help you become familiar with S8 before you will need to use this software package even more extensively (when preparing Homework 2 and the Human Genome Project case in particular), so I strongly urge you to prepare it thoroughly - even if you don't get the ClearPictures model 100% right for Class 4, it is very important that you try!\n\nFinally, an anonymous feedback survey will be posted on the class server at the end of the module for you to complete - this is a key point in helping me to continuously improve the quality of this module (and thus the learning experience of future LFM students), so I ask that you please fill it completely and honestly.",

Graves\n\nMid Term Solution\n\nMr. Smith's Garden\n\nFORMULATION\n\nDecision variables (5 points): there are decision variables for vegetables planted, for\ntomatoes sold, for tomatoes frozen, for soup made and sold. All variables are non\nnegative.\n\nDefine\nX1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6 - number of plants to grow, for beefsteak tomato, better boy\ntomato, ... green pepper, respectively. (units are number of plants)\n\nT7, T8, ... T20 - pounds of tomatoes to sell in weeks 7, 8, ... 20.\n\nF7, F8, ... F20 - pounds of tomatoes to freeze in weeks 7, 8, ... 20.\n\nS9, S8, ... S16 - pounds of soup to make in week 9, 10, ... 16.\n\nY - pounds of soup to sell.\n\nConstraints (20 points): there are resource constraints, balance constraints for tomatoes,\nand supply constraints for soup.\n\nResource constraints\n\nThere are only 2000 square feet for planting:\n\n9 X1 + 8 X2 + ... + 3 X6 £ 2000.\n\nThere are only 25 hours of labor each week:\n\n0.1 X1 + 0.1 X2 + ... + 0.05 X6 £ 25.\n\nTomato balance constraints\n\nIn each week, tomatoes produced equals tomatoes consumed by Mr. Smith, or frozen, or\nsold.\n\n1.5 X3 - Ti - Fi = 10\n\nfor i = 7, 8, 9\n2 X2 + 1.5 X3 - Ti - Fi = 10\n\nfor i = 10\n2 X1 + 2 X2 + 1.5 X3 - Ti - Fi = 10\nfor i = 11, 12 ... 16\n2 X1 + 2 X2 - Ti - Fi = 10\n\nfor i = 17\n\nMid Term Solution\n\n2 X1 - Ti - Fi = 10\n\nfor i = 18, 19, 20\n\nThere is also a demand constraint as Mr. Smith needs 250 pounds of frozen tomatoes.\n\nF7 + F8 + ... +F20 ≥ 250.\n\nSoup supply constraints\n\nEach week the amount of soup made is limited by the ingredients, that need be supplied\naccording to the recipe. One can deduce that soup can only be made in weeks 9, 10, ...\n16, due to the requirement to use fresh ingredients. The amount made cannot exceed the\navailable supply of ingredients. Since one eggplant bush yields one pound of vegetable\neach week and one pound of eggplant is needed to produce four pounds of soup, then one\neggplant bush is needed for every four pounds of soup that we make. Similarly we need\none zucchini plant to make twelve pounds of soup, and one green pepper plant for every\ntwo pounds of soup we make.\n\n4 X4 - Si ≥ 0\n12 X5 - Si ≥ 0\n\nfor i = 9, 10, ... 16.\n2 X6 - Si ≥ 0\n\nWe need 200 pounds of soup for winter and can sell up to 2000 pounds of soup:\n\nS9 + S10 + ... + S16 - Y ≥ 200,\n\nand\nY £ 2000.\n\nObjective function (10 points): The objective is to maximize revenue net of operating\ncosts.\n\nMr. Smith gets revenue from selling tomatoes according to the declining price schedule,\nand from selling soup a $5 per pound:\n\nRevenue($) = 4 T7 + ... + 3.2 T11 + ... + 2.2 T16 + ... 1.4 T20 + 5 Y\n\nMr. Smith has a labor cost for each plant. For instance, for each Beefsteak plant, he\nrequires 0.1 hours of labor each week for 20 weeks, at a cost of $8 per hour. Thus the\nlabor cost is $16 per Beefsteak plant for the season.\n\nCost($) = 16 X1 + 16 X2 + 24 X3 + 8 X4 + 8 X5 + 8 X6\n\nThe objective is to maximize Revenue - Cost.\n\nMid Term Solution\n\nSOLUTION\n(15 points)\nThe optimal solution is given by\n\nNumber of plants\nBeefsteak tomato\n67.5\nBetter Boy tomato\n19.3\nRutgers tomato\n6.7\nEggplant\n68.8\nZucchini\n22.9\nGreen Pepper\n137.5\n\nTomatoes sold\nTomatoes frozen\nSoup Made\nWeek 7\n\nWeek 8\n\nWeek 9\n\nWeek 10\n38.5\n\nWeek 11\n173.5\n\nWeek 12\n173.5\n\nWeek13\n173.5\n\nWeek 14\n173.5\n\nWeek 15\n173.5\n\nWeek 16\n173.5\n\nWeek 17\n163.5\n\nWeek 18\n\nWeek 19\n\nWeek 20\n\nAt the end of the season 2000 pounds of soup are sold. The net revenue to Mr. Smith\nfrom this plan is $10112.83.\n\nMid Term Solution\n\nExtra Labor (10 points): Mr. Smith should not seek extra labor as the optimal plan only\nrequires 21 hours now, and there is five hours of slack. The shadow price of additional\nlabor is zero.\n\nMore Space (15 points): As shown below, the shadow price for more space is $3.40 per\nsquare foot. This shadow price is valid for an increase of 309 square feet. Thus, you can't\nanswer the question without re-running the solver.\n\nFinal\nShadow\nConstraint\nAllowable\nAllowable\nCell\nName\nValue\nPrice\nR.H. Side\nIncrease\nDecrease\n$C$9\ngarden area\n3.40\n309.17\n154.17\n\nWhen one re-runs the problem with 310 more square feet of space (total equals 2310), the\nshadow price for space drops to $3.20 per square foot, and this is valid between 309 and\n367 additional square feet.\n\nFinal\nShadow\nConstraint\nAllowable\nAllowable\nCell\nName\nValue\nPrice\nR.H. Side\nIncrease\nDecrease\n$C$9\ngarden area\n3.2\n57.08\n0.83\n\nWhen one re-runs the problem with 368 more square feet of space, the shadow price\ndrops to zero, as the space constraint is no longer binding; the solution remains\nunchanged for any amount of additional space beyond 368 square feet.\n\nWith 367 more square feet of space, the profit is $11349.33, an increase of $1236.67.\nThis is the most that Mr. Smith would pay for 500 square feet of space. Indeed, he would\nbe willing to pay as much as $3.40 per square foot for the first 309 square feet, and then\n$3.20 per square feet for the next 58 square feet. But he would not pay anything for\nincremental space beyond 367 square feet.\n\nHe will use the additional land to modify the mix of Beefsteak tomatoes and Better Boy\ntomatoes. The number of Rutgers tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini and green peppers remain\nthe same. The table below shows how the plant mix changes as the size of the garden\nexpands.\n\n2000 square feet\n2309 square feet\n2367 square feet\nBeef Steak\n67.5\n67.5\n125.4\nBetter Boy\n19.3\n57.9\n\nAs one initially adds space, the extra space is used to plant more Better Boy tomatoes,\nand ultimately to sell more tomatoes. This is because the revenue per square foot for\nBetter Boy is higher than for Beef steak (once we have satisfied the requirement for\nfrozen tomatoes).\n\nHowever, after we add 309 square feet, then the labor constraint is binding. As we add\nadditional space, we actually reduce the number of Better Boy plants and increase the\nnumber of Beef Steak plants. For each additional square foot we substitute one Beef\n\nMid Term Solution\n\nSteak for one Better Boy, since each require the same amount of labor but Beef steak\nrequires one more square foot than Better Boy. Profit goes up since a single Beef Steak\nplant generates more revenue than a single Better Boy plant. This substitution stops after\nwe add 58 more square feet since the number of Better Boy plants is now zero.\n\nTomato Purchases (15 points): The following table shows the non-zero reduced costs for\nthe decision variable for selling tomatoes for the optimal solution. In all of the other\nweeks the reduced cost is zero.\n\nFinal\nReduced\nObjective\nAllowable\nAllowable\nCell\nName\nValue\nCost\nCoefficient\nIncrease\nDecrease\n$N$17 week 9 sell tom\n0.00\n-0.87\n3.60\n0.87\n1E+30\n$N$27 week 19 sell tom\n0.00\n-0.05\n1.60\n0.05\n1E+30\n$N$28 week 20 sell tom\n0.00\n-0.25\n1.40\n0.25\n1E+30\n\nThese reduced costs suggest that Mr. Smith might want to buy tomatoes in weeks 9, 19,\nand 20. We can also look at the shadow prices for the tomato balance constraints, which\nindicate the impact on profit from having to supply one more pound of tomatoes. These\nshadow prices exceed the market price for tomatoes in weeks 9, 19 and 20, which\nsuggests that Mr. Smith would want to buy tomatoes in these weeks.\n\nTo confirm this intuition, we can re-solve the LP - where we add a set of variables to\ndenote buying tomatoes in each week. The tomato balance constraints are now modified,\ne.g., for weeks 11, 12...16:\n\n2 X1 + 2 X2 + 1.5 X3 - Ti - Fi + Bi = 10\n\nfor i = 11, 12 ... 16\n\nwhere Bi is the amount bought in week i.\n\nThe garden plan is now\n\nbeefsteak betterboy rutgers\neggplant zucchini\ngreen\npepper\n101.04\n68.75\n22.92\n137.5\n\nWith a profit of 10187.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Smith buys 10 pounds of tomatoes in weeks 7, 8, 9, 18, and 19, and then\nbuys 260 pounds in week 20. It is cheaper for Mr. Smith to buy tomatoes in these weeks,\nrather than plant Rutgers plants for the early weeks or plant Beef Steaks for the last\nweeks of the season.\n\nSoup Sale (10 points) From the sensitivity report, we get the reduced cost for the upper\nbound on the amount of soup sold:\n\nFinal\nReduced\nObjective\nAllowable\nAllowable\nCell\nName\nValue\nCost\nCoefficient\nIncrease\nDecrease\n\nMid Term Solution\n\n$L$6\nsoup sold\n2000.00\n2.33\n5.00\n1E+30\n2.33\n\nThis tells us that if we could sell an incremental pound of soup for $5, then our total\nprofit increases by $2.33. So if we were to sell the incremental pound of soup for $3,\nthen our profit increases by $0.33. So the proposed contract has potential to be of\ninterest.\n\nThe above sensitivity information does not tell us the range over which the reduced cost\nis valid. So we need to re-solve the LP. When we do, we get a new garden plan:\n\nbeefsteak betterboy rutgers\neggplant zucchini\ngreen\npepper\n67.5\n5.73\n6.67\n\nWith a profit of $10177.83. We take the contract for 200 additional pounds of soup.\nConsequently we increase the amount of the garden used for eggplant, zucchini, and\ngreen peppers so as to make 200 more pounds of soup. We make 300 pounds of soup in\neach week from week 9 to week 16.\n\nWe still plant 67.5 Beef Steak and 6.67 Rutgers - so as to satisfy Mr. Smith's\nrequirements. We reduce the number of Better Boy plants, and thus reduce the amount of\ntomatoes that we sell.\n\nMid Term Solution"

      "content": "Leaders for Manufacturing\n\n15.066J\nSummer 2003\n\nS. C. Graves\n\nMid Term\n\n1.\nThe mid term is due June 30 at 8:00 AM; please bring hard copy to class.\n\n2.\nYour assignment is to address a series of questions raised by the attached case:\nMr. Smith's Garden. It is okay to address the questions point by point, just like you\nwould prepare a homework set.\n\n3.\nIn preparing your answers for Mr. Smith's Garden, you are to work independently\nand you should not consult with your fellow students nor any one else for that matter.\nYou can draw upon class resources: the textbook, notes, problem sets. You can use other\nresources, like another textbook, notes from another class, or a web-based library, but if\nso, you should indicate this as part of your submission. You should not search the web\nfor a solution to the case.\n\n4.\nIf you use a public computer, be sure to remove or delete all of your unsecured\nfiles whenever you leave the computer.\n\n5.\nYou may consult with the TA or me.\n\n6.\nIn formulating the LP, take care to check that you have consistent units\nthroughout the constraint set. Also, to get meaningful sensitivity analysis information,\nyou should write constraints in Excel so that the decision variables are on the left-hand\nside and a constant is on the right-hand side of the constraint equation.\n\n7.\nTime guidelines: It is hard to estimate how long the assignment will take. But\nhere are some targets, which you should treat as upper bounds: 90 minutes to read case\nand develop algebraic formulation on paper; 90 minutes to set up LP on Excel, debug and\nsolve; two hours to address the questions; and two hours to write up the answers.\n\nIf you find yourself exceeding these times, then something is wrong and you\nshould consult with the TA or me.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT EXCEED 8 HOURS.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nQuestions for Mr. Smith's Garden.\n\na.\nPossibly a linear program might be the best way to address Mr. Smith's concerns.\nFormulate this problem using the data in the case and then solve it (presumably\nwith Excel). You should state the algebraic formulation and be sure to define\nclearly all of the decision variables, constraints and objective function. You\nshould then convey to Mr. Smith what he should plant in order to meet his\nrequirements and maximize his profit from his garden. To answer this, DO NOT\nWORRY about the integrality of the decision variables - the garden is very big\nand it's okay to plant fractional bushes for the purposes of this exercise.\n\nThe following questions are to be addressed independently.\n\nb.\nIf Mr. Smith could hire up to another 5 hours of labor per week at $15 per hour,\nshould he do this? Why or why not?\nc.\nSuppose Mr. Smith could rent another 500 square feet to add to his garden. What\nis the value of this? What would he use it for?\nd.\nSuppose Mr. Smith would be willing to buy tomatoes at the market price during\nthe season for his own consumption, and for meeting his need for frozen\ntomatoes. Would he want to do this? Why or why not?\ne.\nSuppose Mr. Smith has an opportunity to sell an additional 200 pounds of soup at\n$3 per pound. Should he agree to this contract? How would his garden plan\nchange?\nf.\nHow long did you spend on the exam?\n\nGrading - 50 points for part (a), and the remaining 50 points divided roughly equally\nover parts (b) through (e).\n\nNOTE - FOR ALL QUESTION, DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE INTEGRALITY OF\nTHE DECISION VARIABLES. IT IS OKAY TO HAVE FRACTIONAL SOLUTIONS.\n\nMr. Smith's Garden\n\nMr. Smith is an avid gardener, and each spring he must plan what to plant in his\nvegetable garden. He grows tomatoes, eggplants, zucchini and green peppers. He would\nlike his garden to provide a rich harvest of these vegetables so that he has fresh\nvegetables throughout the late summer and fall, as well as frozen vegetables for the\nwinter.\n\nIt is now June 1, 2003, and he is about to go to the local nursery to pick the vegetables to\nplant. He has constructed the table below to help decide what to plant.\n\nSquare\nfeet per\nplant\nHours per\nweek\nWeeks\nuntil first\nharvest\nYield per\nweek per\nplant\n(pounds)\nLength of\nharvest\n(weeks)\nBeefsteak\ntomato\n0.1\nBetter Boy\ntomato\n0.1\nRutgers\ntomato\n0.15\n1.5\nEggplant\n0.05\nZucchini\n0.05\nGreen\nPepper\n0.05\n\nFrom past experience he has identified three types of tomatoes to consider growing, along\nwith his eggplant, zucchini and green pepper.\n\nFor each vegetable, he needs to decide the number of plants to grow. Each plant will\noccupy a certain amount of area in the garden, as noted in the second column. His garden\nis 2000 square feet in total.\n\nAlso, each plant requires a certain amount of labor each week (third column), to weed,\nfertilize, water and harvest. For instance, each Beefsteak tomato plant requires 0.1 hour\nper week. This labor requirement starts when it is planted, and won't end until the end of\nthe harvest, 20 weeks later (i.e., the labor requirements continue even after the plant stops\nyielding produce.). Mr. Smith hires a neighborhood girl at $8 per hour to do this work for\nhim. However, he expects that the neighborhood girl has only 25 hours to work each\nweek, as she is also attending summer school.\n\nMr. Smith plants the entire garden on June 1. The fourth column indicates how many\nweeks until he gets the first fresh vegetables from each plant type. Once the plant is\nyielding vegetables, he estimates that he can harvest a fixed number of pounds per week,\nas given in the fifth column. This harvest will go for a number of weeks, as noted in the\n\nsixth column. For instance, a Rutgers plant produces 1.5 pounds of tomatoes each week\nfor a ten-week period, namely from week 7 through to week 16.\n\nThe growing season is from week 7 to week 20. During the growing season Mr. Smith\nwill consume 10 pounds of fresh tomatoes each week. He insists on eating those that he\ngrows.\n\nIn addition to eating his tomatoes, each week Mr. Smith has the option to freeze fresh\ntomatoes for use in the winter. By week 20, he needs to have 250 pounds of frozen\ntomatoes. The tomatoes that he freezes must come from his garden; he will not buy\ntomatoes for this use. Any leftover tomatoes can be sold at the market at the market price.\nHe expects that the market price will be $4 per pound for week 7, and then will drop in\nprice by $.20 per pound every week thereafter. Thus, he expects in week 20 the price per\npound will be $1.40.\n\nMr. Smith uses the other vegetables to make vegetable soup that he stores for\nconsumption in the winter. His recipe calls for 1 pound of zucchini and 2 pounds of\ngreen peppers for every pound of eggplant; this recipe will make 4 pounds of soup. To\nmake the soup, all of the vegetables must be fresh; that is, the vegetables were picked in\nthe same week that the soup is made. By the end of the season, he needs to have 200\npounds of soup prepared for the winter. Any leftover vegetables can be used to make\nmore soup to be sold at the market. Mr. Smith expects that he will be able to sell up to\n2000 pounds of soup for $5 per pound. Excess eggplants, or zucchini or green peppers\ncannot be sold and are put into the compost pile."

      "content": "New Bedford Steel Coking Coal Supply Problem 1\n\nNew Bedford Steel (NBS) is a small steel manufacturing company. Coking coal\nis a necessary raw material in the production of steel, and NBS procures 1.0 - 1.5 million\ntons of coking coal per year. It is now time to plan for the 1997 production, and Stephen\nCoggins, coal supply manager for NBS, has solicited and received bids from the\nfollowing eight suppliers for next year.

This coal must have\nan average volatility of at least 19% (volatility is the percent of volatile or burnable\nmatter in the coal). Also, as a hedge against adverse labor relations, NBS has decided to\nprocure at least 50% of its coking coal from union mines (United Mine Workers).\nFinally, Steve Coggins needs to keep in mind that capacity for bringing in coal by rail is\nlimited to roughly 650 mtons per year, and capacity for bring in coal by truck is limited\nto 720 mtons per year.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1.\nHow much coal should Coggins contract for from each supplier?\n\n2.\nWhat will be NBS's total cost of supply?\n\n3.\nWhat will be NBS's average cost of supply?\n15.066J\nSummer 2003\n\nExcel Spreadsheet for New Bedford Steel\n\n-In the third row we have defined the decision cells.

For changes greater than the reduced cost, the variable may become non-zero in the\noptimal solution.\n\nIf the decision variable equals its upper bound in the optimal solution, then the reduced\ncost is the amount by which the objective function coefficient for the variable can\nincrease before the variable may drop below the upper bound in the optimal solution.\n\nCaution: Different solvers may use different conventions, particularly with the signs of\nthe shadow prices or the reduced costs. You always need to check your economic\nintuition to assure that you are making the right interpretation. Also, different solvers\nmay refer to dual prices, rather than shadow prices: they are the same.\n\n15.066J\nSummer 2003\n\nNow, let's consider the volatility constraint from the NBS case. Suppose that we re-\nwrite the constraint as follows:\n\n0.15A + 0.16B + .... + 0.25H >= 0.19 (A + B + .... + H)\n\nThat is, the LHS is the amount of volatile matter supplied, measured in mtons, and the\nRHS is the required level of volatile matter measured in mtons. The constraint says that\nthe amount supplied needs be greater than the amount required.\n\nThe shadow price on this constraint will convey the change to the objective function for\nthe optimal solution when we re-solve with the above constraint replaced with the\nfollowing constraint:\n\n0.15A + 0.16B + .... + 0.25H >= 0.19 (A + B + .... + H) + 1\n\nWhen we do this, the objective function would increase by 300 units ($300,000 in this\ncase). Note a unit increase to the above constraint is comparable to adding 100 to the\nRHS for the original constraint as formulated earlier; thus, we expect that adding 1 to the\noriginal constraint would increase the objective function by 3, which is the reported\nshadow price.\n\nInterpretation: At the margin for the optimal solution, the additional cost to supply 1\nmton of volatile matter is $300,000 (or $300 for 1 ton of volatile matter).\n\nWe can reinterpret this in terms of the volatility content of coal. Each percentage point\nof volatility will supply 0.01 tons of volatile matter per ton of coal. Since the cost to\nsupply 1 ton of volatile matter is $300, each percentage point of volatility has a value of\n$3 per ton of coal.\n\n15.066J\nSummer 2003\n\nFollow-up Questions:\n\n4.\nWhat is the cost of coking coal on the margin? I.e., how much does an\nextra ton of coking coal cost NBS? (Why is this a valuable question to\nask?)\n\n5.\nHow should NBS value a nonunion/union supplier on a cost basis?\nShould they pay a premium fee for a union supplier? Is this a legitimate\nway to think about the problem?\n\n6.\nHow should NBS value a low-vol./high-vol. supplier on a cost basis?\nShould they pay a premium for an extra % volatility? Is this a legitimate\nway to think about the problem?\n\n7.\nShould NBS consider expanding their trucking capacity? If so, how much\nshould they be willing to spend?\n\n8.\nShould NBS consider expanding their rail capacity? If so, how much\nshould they be willing to spend?\n\n9.\nShould Coggins be willing to negotiate a higher price in order to get more\ncoal from Bedford and/or Gaston? If so, how high should he be willing to\ngo?\n\n10.\nIf Florence is uneconomical, how much must NBS insist that they lower\ntheir price before they would take them on as a supplier?\n\n11.\nIf NBS contracts with Earlham, and their actual volatility rating goes\ndown, how much of a penalty should NBS insist on in their contract?\n\n15.066J\nSummer 2003\n\nNew Bedford Steel Coking Coal Supply Problem - Addendum\n\nFrom the optimal solution we can use the shadow prices on the resource and\nquality constraints to infer an ex-post imputed cost for each coal source. The shadow\nprices tell us that there is an opportunity cost of $1/ton for usage of truck capacity and\nthat each percentage point in volatility can be valued at $3 per ton. We can then compare\nthe (imputed) costs for coal as follows:\n\nAshley\nBedford Consol Dunby\nEarlam\nFlorence Gaston Hopt\n\nprice/ton\n$49.50\n$50.00\n$61.00 $63.50\n$66.50\n$71.00\n$72.50 $80.00\n\ntrucking\n\n+1.00\n\n+1.00\n+1.00\n+1.00\n\ncosts\n\nnet\nvolatility\n+12.00\n+9.00\n+3.00\n-3.00\n-6.00\n-9.00\n-12.00\n-18.00\ncost\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nimputed\n$61.50\n$60.00\n$64.00 $61.50\n$61.50\n$63.00\n$60.50 $62.00\ncost/ton\n\nNote -- the net volatility cost (or premium) for a coal source is the difference between its\nvolatility and the target of 19%, multiplied by $3/ton.\nObservations:\n-\nIn the optimal solution, coal sources A, D and E are used but are not at their upper\nbounds.

Each pivot starts\nwith a feasible solution and either generates an improved feasible solution or\nconcludes that the current feasible solution is the optimal solution.\n\n3.\nAt each pivot, the computer must solve a system of m equations in m variables,\nwhere m is the number of constraints in the problem.\n\n4.\nTypically, the number of pivots that must be performed is roughly proportional to\nthe number n of decision variables in the problem. Therefore, the more\nconstraints the problem has ( m ) and the more decision variables the problem has\n( n ) , the more computer time will be needed to solve the problem.\n\n5.\nThe simplex method is conceptually simple and easy to learn.

Each desk has to go through four basic\noperations: cutting of the lumber, joining of the pieces, prefinishing, and final\nfinish. Each unit of the Standard desk produced takes 48 minutes of cutting time, 2\nhours of joining, 40 minutes of prefinishing, and 5 hours and 20 minutes of final\nfinishing time. Each unit of the Executive desk requires 72 minutes of cutting, 3\nhours of joining, 2 hours of prefinishing, and 4 hours of final finishing time. The\ndaily capacity for each operation amounts to 16 hours of cutting, 30 hours of\njoining, 16 hours of prefinishing, and 64 hours of final finishing time.

      "content": "Network Problems\nProf. Stephen Graves\n\nNetwork (or graph) is defined by a set of nodes (vertices) and a set of arcs; each arc is\ngiven by a pair of nodes, e. g., (i, j) which denotes that there is an arc between node i and\nnode j, permitting flow between i and j. Usually we deal with directed arcs; e. g., arc (i,\nj) signifies that there can be flow from node i to node j.\n\nNetworks are a useful modeling construct for representing a variety of problems,\nespecially where we are attempting to model some type of flow - material flow;\ntransportation flows; communication flows; etc.\n\nDue to the specialized structure of some network problems, there are very efficient,\nspecialized algorithms for solving these problems; however, all these problems can also\nbe solved as LP's.\n\nThe general form for a network problem is as follows:\n\ndecision variables: xij\ndenotes flow on arc from i to j\n\nflow balance constraints: for every node i, flow into node i must equal flow out of node\ni.\n\niS +\nki\nx\nk∑\n=\nij\nx\nj∑\n+\ni\nD\nwhere Si is the exogenous supply at node i and Di is the exogenous demand at node i.

Power or lighting panels are the circuit boxes that take the main bus\nfrom the power company, and connect it to several branch circuits that power various\nparts or functions of a building. Each panel consists of a box, trim, an interior and the\nbreakers. The interior provides the basic functionality of the lighting panel. The\nelements of the interior consist of three bus bars, which function as the main electrical\nconductor and carry the electrical supply throughout the lighting panel, and the main lug,\nwhich forms the connection between the main electric supply and the lighting panel.\nCircuit breakers form the connection between the individual house circuits and the\nelectrical supply carried by the bus bars. The box holds the lighting panel and the trim\nprovides a protective cover as well as the access to the breakers.\n\nLighting panels differ according to the outside dimensions and layout of the box,\nboth of which are driven by the number of circuits that can be handled. There are\ncurrently 20 different length interiors. Each size currently has its own box. As the\nnumber of different box sizes increases, so does the cost to manufacture this variety.\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that there are four trims options for each box size. It is\npossible, though, to reduce the number of options offered by substituting a larger, more\ncapable box (larger interior) than desired or needed by the customer. The advantage to\nthe company is having fewer items to manufacture, stock and service; furthermore,\ncustomers will get more than they wanted, which has a positive utility provided that it\ndoes not come at a higher price. Reducing the number of boxes that are manufactured\nwill reduce the manufacturing overhead that is driven by product variety ( e. g.,\nscheduling, purchasing, manufacturing engineering). The disadvantage from limiting the\nnumber of options is that the company will be giving away part of the product, by\nproviding more than the customer wants; in particular, there will be wasted material cost,\nfor which the company will not be able to recover the costs.\n\nThe company estimates that the overhead cost per year for each box size is\n$26,000. The material cost for each box is estimated to be $0.60 per inch of length, plus\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\n$5 for the ends of the boxes. Also, marketing projects that customers would actually\nprefer getting a bigger boxes, as long they are not 12\" larger than what was requested.\n\nTo model the problem, create a network:\n\nNodes:\nOne node for each box length\n\nArcs:\nArc (i, j) denotes using the box length assigned to node j to demand for the\nbox length assigned to nodes i+1, i+2, ... j.\n\nArc Cost:\nthe cost for arc (i, j) is the annual fixed cost per box ($26,000) plus the\nannual incremental cost for material for supplying box j to meet demand for boxes i+1,\ni+2, ... j.\n\nNote that if the difference between the box lengths for nodes j and i+1 is\ngreater than 12\", then the arc has an infinite cost (or is not defined).\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nSHORTEST PATH EXAMPLE:\nDESIGN OF AN ASSEMBLY LINE --- EQUIPMENT SELECTION AND TASK\nASSIGNMENT\n\nSuppose we want to design and lay out an assembly line for a given product. To\nassemble the product entails completing N tasks, where the assembly tasks are numbered\naccording to their precedence sequence; that is, task 1 precedes task 2, task 2 precedes\ntask 3, etc.\n\nWe are given a projection of the annual demand for the product and we wish to design an\nassembly system that will have sufficient capacity to meet the demand and will be the\nminimum cost system.\n\nThe assembly system is to be a serial line, consisting of work stations in sequence. Each\ntask is to be assigned to a single work station and each work station is responsible for the\ncompletion of one or more tasks. Thus, in an assembly system, we associate a set of\nconsecutive tasks to each work station.\n\nThe cost for each possible work station (i. e., each set of consecutive tasks) is a complex\nderivation.\n\nIf the work station is a manual station, then the costs include the direct labor costs plus\ncosts for tooling, part feeders and fixtures. The latter costs need to be amortized over the\nannual product volume. And, in order to be a candidate station, it needs to have a cycle\ntime small enough to be able to satisfy the projected annual demand for the product.\n\nIf the station is automated, then there is an investment cost for the primary assembly\nresource (robot or piece of fixed automation), plus the amortized costs for tooling, part\nfeeders and fixtures; there is also a variable operating cost, which covers maintenance,\nmaterial handling and indirect labor. Again, the station needs to be designed so that its\ncycle time is capable of meeting the annual demand for the product.\n\nIf both an automated and a manual station are feasible options for a proposed work\nstation (i. e., a set of consecutive tasks), then the least cost alternative is chosen for\nfurther consideration.\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nOnce all of the possible candidate work stations have been enumerated and costed, then\nthe system design problem is to choose a set of work stations that covers all of the tasks\nat the minimum cost. This can be formulated and solved as a shortest path problem.\n\nThis approach extends to handle (i) multi-product assembly systems; (ii) single products\nwith a partially-ordered precedence structure for the tasks; (iii) probabilistic task times\nor task options; (iv) demand requirements given as a distribution.\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003"

      "content": "INTRODUCTION TO INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING\nWAREHOUSE LOCATION\nProf. Stephen Graves\n\nA firm wants to decide where to locate its warehouses to best serve its customer base. It\nhas aggregated the customer base according to three-digit zip code regions; for each\naggregate customer, the firm has estimated the annual product demand for that region.\nThe firm has also generated a list of candidate warehouse sites; for each candidate site,\nthe firm has estimated the annual fixed cost for opening and operating the warehouse, the\nper-unit transportation costs for supplying the warehouse from the firm's production\nfacilities, and the per-unit transportation costs for supplying each aggregate customer\nfrom this warehouse. In addition to minimizing costs for distribution, the firm insists that\nthe warehouse service to each customer meet some minimum service threshold, e. g.,\ndelivery within 24 hours.\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nA SPARE PARTS PROBLEM\n\nAn office equipment company has a crew of field representatives who provide service to\nthe company's customers. When an installed piece of equipment (a photocopier) fails, a\nfield representative is sent to attempt to diagnose and repair the equipment. In order to\nbe able to complete the repair on site, the field representative carries an inventory of\nspare parts. If the repair requires the replacement of parts that the field rep does not have\non hand, then the field rep must return to the local sales office or warehouse for the part\nand then turn around and return to the customer site. This greatly increases the amount\nof time the customer is inconvenienced due to the failed copier. However, since the field\nrepresentative must carry the spare parts in his/her vehicle, there is a physical limit on\nhow many different types of spare parts can be carried. Furthermore, it is very hard to\nanticipate what parts are needed on any particular repair job; in most instances the\ncustomer is not able to provide very helpful diagnostic information when reporting a\nfailure.\n\nSuppose that there are 100 replaceable parts in the copier, and that pj, j = 1, 2, ... 100, is\nthe probability that part j is needed to complete a repair, given that the copier has failed.\nFor simplicity, assume that the probability of requiring part i is independent of the\nprobability of requiring part j, for all pairs i, j. Let sj be the space consumed by part j,\nand suppose that the field rep's vehicle can carry 40 cubic feet of spare parts.\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nFIXED CHARGE PROBLEM\n\nThe cost function for many production activities consists of a fixed component and a\nvariable component. If there is no production activity, the cost is zero. If there is any\nproduction activity at all, then a fixed cost is incurred; this often will correspond to a\nsetup or changeover cost. Beyond the fixed cost, there may be a variable cost that is\nproportional to the amount of production.\n\nSometimes, if we talk about the production cost function for a production department or\nline, there may be several fixed charges depending upon the number of shifts to be run\n(or some other measure of activity). There may be a fixed charge for operating the first\nshift; this would include overhead and indirect costs required to keep the facility open\nand operate the department. If two shifts are to be run, there will be a fixed charge for\neach shift, with the charge for the second shift usually smaller than for the first.\nSimilarly, there are three fixed charges if three shifts are running. To this, we need add\nthe variable production costs, where the variable cost rate may also depend upon the\nshift. Here it would be common to expect that the variable cost rate for the first shift to be\nlower than for the second, which is lower than the third shift.\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nAPPROXIMATING NON LINEAR FUNCTIONS\n\nSuppose we wish to minimize a piece-wise linear cost function; let x denote the decision\nvariable and c(x), the cost function, is specified as follows:\n\ndc(x)\ndx\n= 2 for 0 ≤ x ≤5;\n\ndc(x)\ndx\n= 1 for 5 ≤ x ≤12;\n\ndc(x)\ndx\n= 3 for 12 ≤ x ≤18.\n\nWe can model c(x) with integer variables so that the minimization of c(x), subject to\nvarious constraints on x, can be solved as an integer program.\n\nc(x)\n=\n2x1 + x2 + 3x3\n\nx\n=\nx1 + x2 + x3\n\n5y1 <= x1 <= 5 ; 7y2 <= x2 <= 7y1 ; 0 <= x3 <= 6y2\n\nand y1 = 0 or 1; y2 = 0 or 1.\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS\n\n1.

This problem,\nwhile quite important in its own right, is the fundamental sub-problem for more complex\nvehicle-routing and machine-scheduling problems. The traveling salesman problem is\nalso the standard benchmark for testing and evaluating new combinatorial-optimization\nalgorithms.\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nCUTTING STOCK PROBLEM\n\nA firm that manufactures oil-drilling rigs purchases steel beams from a steel supplier.\nThe steel supplier will deliver a batch of beams at a time. The steel beams come in\nvarying lengths that range from 38 feet to 42 feet, and will vary both within a batch and\nfrom batch to batch. The firm uses the beams to make brackets, and the first step in the\nfabrication process is to cut the beams to the bracket length. The bracket lengths can be 6\nfeet, 7 feet, 8 feet, or 10 feet.\nGiven a batch of beams and given a set of requirements for brackets, the firm must decide\nhow to cut the beams so as to minimize trim loss.\nAs a simple example, suppose we have on hand 10 forty-foot beams and we need to\nproduce the following:\n\n6' brackets\n\n7' brackets\n\n8' brackets\n\n10' brackets\n\nHow should the beams be cut to minimize material usage?\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nFORWARD PLANNING FOR AUTOMOBILE COMPONENTS\n\n[From Michael J. Chrzanowski's LFM thesis, Development of a Manufacturing and\nBusiness Planning Tool to Aid in Forward Planning, 1993] Consider a manufacturing\nenterprise that produces a family of automobile components at several manufacturing\nlocations. About two dozen items represents 80% of the enterprise's manufacturing\nvolume. There are five locations; the locations differ in terms of their manufacturing\nprocesses, their production rates, their costs, and their capacities.\nThe forward planning process determines which products are to be made at what\nlocations. These decisions are complicated by the fact that the allocation decision\ndepends on investment decisions, which need to be determined concurrently. In order to\nmanufacture a product at a particular location may require an investment or investments\nat the location. These investments are associated with product features, and result in the\nlocation having the capability of producing any product with a specific feature. Thus, a\nparticular investment at a location may be applicable to more than one product.\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nCOMPONENT ASSIGNMENT\n\n(From Dennis J. Arnow's LFM thesis, Increasing Throughput in a Surface Mount\nAssembly Line by Improving Machine Balance and Revising Metrics, 1993) A surface\nmount assembly operation consists of three major steps: solder paste application,\ncomponent placement, and solder re-flow. For most products, the bottleneck of the\nprocess is the component placement step.\n\nThere are three insertion machines in sequence. Each of these machines has different\ncapabilities in terms of what types of components it can handle and at what speed it can\noperate. The first machine is a high-speed chip shooter. The second machine is a pick-\nand-place machine that operates about ten times slower than the chip shooter; but the\npick-and-place is needed to handle some large components that can't be inserted by the\nchip shooter. The third machine is also a pick-and-place machine but with slightly\ndifferent characteristics than the other pick-and-place machine.\n\nProducts are manufactured in batches, where each board in a batch visits each of the three\nmachines in sequence. One issue in operating the line is how to assign components to\neach of these machines so as to increase the throughput of the line.\n\nFor instance suppose we consider a product that has 509 components to insert of the\nfollowing types:\n\nComponent Type\nNumber of Components\nA\nB\nC\nD\nF\nG\nI\nJ\nK\nL\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nThe operating speeds (in seconds) for inserting a component vary by component type and\nby machine:\n\nComponent Type\nMachine 1\nMachine 2\nMachine 3\nA\n0.3\n2.6\n2.8\nB\n0.3\n2.8\n3.0\nC\n0.36\n2.8\n3.0\nD\n0.48\n2.8\n3.0\nF\n0.57\n2.8\n3.0\nG\n0.57\n3.0\n3.3\nI\n0.96\n3.0\n3.6\nJ\n\n2.8\n3.0\nK\n\n3.6\n4.5\nL\n\n4.5\n\nBlanks in the table signify that the machine cannot handle that type of component.\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nOPTIMIZATION OF IN-LINE INSPECTION IN WAFER FABRICATION\n\n(From John W. Bean's LFM thesis, Variation Reduction in a Wafer Fabrication Line\nThrough Inspection Optimization, 1997) One important source of lost output in\nsemiconductor manufacturing is special-cause defects or excursions.\n\nExcursions are typically caused by a preventable condition that can be corrected\nthrough better system design and maintenance. System improvements are cost effective\nuntil a reasonable risk level is achieved. A company must live with some level of\nexcursion risk below which it is uneconomical or impossible to achieve improvement. At\nthis point, the impact of excursions can only be limited by improved detection.\n\nThe impact of an excursion depends on its severity and how much product is\naffected before it is identified by in-line inspection and corrected. Excursions can be\ntraced to certain higher risk process steps. These high-risk steps include metal\ndeposition, photolithography, etchant steps and film deposition steps.\nEach excursion has a different impact on the lots, wafers and dice it affects. Some\nexcursions are intermittent while others are consistent. One excursion may impact all\nwafers but only a few dice per wafer. Another may only impact one out of three wafers\nbut every die on these wafers.\n\nThe locations of in-line inspection determine the impact of an excursion. Proper\nexcursion control will consider both the informational and production loops shown in the\nfigure. The solid line represents the flow of product and the dotted line represents the\nflow of information.\n\nExcursion\nSource\nInspection\nLocation\nSource is identified and\ncorrective action taken.\nDefect is detected.\n\nFlow of excursionary material and information.\n\nThere may be an opportunity to improve the control of excursions through the\nimproved allocation of inspection resources for several reasons. First, in-line inspection\nplans are developed during the initial process development and may or may not be\nadjusted as the process is modified. Hence, current inspection plans may be artifacts of\npast processing conditions. Second, there is a tendency to view inspection plan\nmodifications in isolation. Inspections may be added, moved or removed based on data\ncollected at a single area in the process. This data may indicate the need to modify a\nspecific inspection step, but a holistic view of the process could uncover additional\nopportunities for improvement.\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nThe analysis tools that were developed include the formulation for an\noptimization routine and a scenario analysis tool. Both tools are built from the same\ngeneral formulation that mathematically represents the nature of excursion occurrences\nand the typical procedures followed by the defect reduction group.\n\nThe model formulation begins by breaking the several hundred process steps\ndown into modules based on the most probable inspection locations. Typically, the top\n30-50 possible inspection locations are used to divide the process into modules. Process\nsteps are sectioned into modules according to the following guidelines.\n- Queue limitations -- Queue limits between steps prevent any additional material\nhandling or inspection. The most common example is the queue restriction following\neach cleaning operation. Product must be processed immediately following a\ncleaning operation to prevent re-contamination of the wafer surface.\n- Process limitations -- Processing conditions make certain locations unfavorable for\ninspection. Photo-resist residue, deposited films or etching operations may reduce\nthe sensitivity of an inspection below acceptable levels.\n- Risk assessment -- Certain steps can be grouped together because of low probability\nof excursion occurrence, Pr[excursion].\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003"

      "content": "INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING: SOLUTION TECHNIQUES\nProf. Stephen Graves\n\n- For linear programming, the simplex method is a very robust solution algorithm. For\nany kind of linear program, it will solve the linear program very quickly regardless of the\nproblem context or the mathematical structure.\n- For integer programming there is no robust solution procedure. There is no one\nmethod that will work well for all or most problems. In fact, most integer programming\nproblems are time-consuming to solve and can be enormously difficult to solve,\ndepending on the mathematical structure.\n- There are many very sophisticated and complicated methods designed to solve\nefficiently specific classes or types of integer programs, e. g., the traveling salesman\nproblem or the knapsack problem.\n- Four general purpose methods for solving integer programs:\n\na. Rounding. The idea is to solve the linear program version of the problem, and then\nround the solution to be integer. The resulting answer may or may not be optimal. It\nmay or may not be feasible. It may or may not be near optimal. For some problems the\ndecision of how to do the rounding is obvious; for some others it is not.\nb. Enumeration. The idea is to enumerate all possible integer solutions. This is a good\nidea only when the number of integer variables is fairly small, or your computer budget is\nlarge: if there are 10 binary variables, there will be 210 = 1024 possible solutions, etc.\nc. Cutting Plane Methods. The idea here is to cut away the feasible region until all of\nthe remaining corner points are integer points. This is done by adding constraints (cuts)\nto the original problem, and then solving the resulting problem as a linear program. This\nmethod is increasing in importance for some specialized classes of problems.\nd. Branch and Bound. The idea here is to divide and conquer. The method proceeds\nby partially enumerating solutions and solving linear programs over smaller feasible\nregions, gaining information and being able to ignore a huge number of possible\nsolutions in the process. This is the most successful general purpose integer\nprogramming technique available. Solving integer programs with up to 100 binary\ninteger variables is relatively routine with desktop codes, such as LINDO or CPLEX.\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nBranch and Bound\n\n- Key idea is divide and conquer. Solve ILP as LP, then partition problem into two or\nmore pieces. (this is called branching) Solve the LP version of the sub-problems and, if\nnecessary, continue partitioning. (solving the LP version yields a bound on the ILP)\n- The efficiency of approach comes when it is possible to \"fathom\" a sub-problem.\nFathoming occurs when we have determined that we do not need to explore any further\nthe possible solutions within a sub-problem.\n\nWe can fathom a sub-problem if any of the following conditions are discovered\nwhen we solve the LP version of the sub-problem:\na. there is no feasible solution to the sub-problem;\nb. the optimal LP solution satisfies the integer requirements of the ILP;\nc. the optimal objective value from the sub-problem LP is worse than the best\nknown solution to the ILP (the incumbent solution).\n\nExample:\n\nMAX Z =\nX + Y\n\ns. t.\n\nX + 2Y <= 16\n\n2X + Y <= 14.9\n\nX, Y >= 0, INTEGER\n\nSolve LP relaxation: X* = 4.6; Y* = 5.7; Z = 10.3\n\nPartition into two sub-problems to try to force one of the variables (Y) to be integer:\n\nMAX Z = X + Y\n\nMAX Z = X + Y\ns. t.\nX + 2Y <= 16\n\ns. t.\n\nX + 2Y <= 16\n\n2X + Y <= 14.9\n\n2X + Y <= 14.9\n\nY >= 6\n\nY <= 5\n\nSolve each LP relaxation:\nX* = 4; Y* = 6; Z = 10\n\nX* = 4.95; Y* = 5; Z = 9.95\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nBRANCH AND BOUND EXAMPLE\n\nMAX Z = 60 X1 + 60 X2 + 40 X3 + 10 X4 + 20 X5 + 3 X6\n\nSUBJECT TO\n\n3 X1 + 5 X2 + 4 X3 + X4 + 4 X5 + X6 <= 10\n\nX1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6 = 0 or 1\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003\n\nBRANCH AND BOUND EXAMPLE\n\nMAX Z = 60 X1 + 60 X2 + 40 X3 + 10 X4 + 20 X5 + 3 X6\n\nSUBJECT TO\n\n3 X1 + 5 X2 + 4 X3 + X4 + 4 X5 + X6 <= 10\n\nX1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6 = 0 or 1\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n15.066J\n\nSummer 2003"

      "content": "15.066 Systems Optimization and Analysis\nOptimization Project\n\nLabor Planning for a Manufacturing Line\n\nTeam 1\nThe Tek Team\n\nLane Ballard\n\nChristine Cheung\n\nJustin Ging\n\nOmur Kaya\n\nDavid Jackson\n\nAlyson Naughton\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe objective of this project was to create an LP model which could allocate labor on a\nmanufacturing line. The line manufactures precision thermostats for the aerospace industry\n(see Exhibits 1 and 2). Current monthly demand for the product ranges from 25 thousand and\n45 thousand units with an average of 35 thousand units per month. Parts are processed\ncontinuously through the line so there is no need to complete all operations on all parts during\nthe month (or day) and parts are shipped on a daily basis. There are three main\nmanufacturing areas: an open area and two clean rooms.\n\nMachine operators are paid on an hourly basis depending on their job grade and the area they\nare working. Job grades range from one to five - grade fives perform the highest skilled work\nand are paid the highest. A grade five worker is able to perform all jobs from one to five, but a\ngrade one worker can only perform grade one jobs. There are 2nd and 3rd shift hourly\npremiums as well as clean room hourly premiums paid to workers. For safety reasons, there is\nalso a minimum requirement of at least five people per shift if the shift is to be run. A single\nworker can only work a single machine at any given time. The hourly pay rates for each job\ngrade can be seen in Exhibit 3 and the minimum grade required to perform each job can be\nseen in Exhibit 4.\n\nThe LP model minimizes the total labor cost per month and allows supervision to schedule\ndaily work. Analysis of the output of the model shows the effect of demand fluctuations on\nlabor cost and machine utilization. This optimization tool can be used to determine the size\nand skill level of the workforce required to meet product demand as well as aid the supervisor\nto direct each shift to the operations needed to be done. Note that the LP model is not\nintended for the scheduling of individual workers to a specific task per hour.\n\nDescription of the LP Model:\n\nThe LP model is built to analyze the number of work hours needed from each grade level\nworker for different operations on different shifts. The model gives the plant information for\ndeciding how many workers are needed to meet the demand in a given month.\n\nDecision Variables\n\nWork hours required: This is the number of work hours required for each operation at each\ngrade level by shift.\n\nShifts: This decision variable is a binary variable. It indicates which shift has to run depending\non the demand. It is equal to 1 if shift has to be run, 0 otherwise.\n\nConstants and Inputs\n\nNumber of days per month: This is an input of the work days in a given month. This number\ncan be changed based upon holidays and the plant schedule for each month. This is used\nlater in the constraints section of the LP model.\n\nDemand: Demand is the number of units that the plant needs to produce in a given month. It\ncan be changed by changing the demand cell in the LP model.\n\nFraction Fraction is a constant that is percentage of the products that goes through a given\noperation. Thus, there is a fraction for every operation. If all of the products have to go through\nan operation the fraction is equal to one. If 50% of the products have to go through an\noperation, the fraction is equal to 0.5.\n\nCurrent work force: In some of the LP runs the current work forces is entered as an input to the\nmodel. All of the hours of the current workforce must be used before additional workers can\nbe added.\n\nNumber of work stations: The number of available machines for each operation was entered\nas an input to the model. (See Exhibit 4)\n\nNumber of units produced per hour: This is the number of parts that can be processed per\nhour by each machine for a given operation. (See Exhibit 4)\n\nSecond and third shift penalty: For 2nd and 3rd shifts, there is a fixed cost of starting up the\nadditional shift. This represents the additional electricity consumption, additional security and\nso on. This fixed cost is the same for both shifts and it is estimated at $5000 per month.\n\nConstraints\n\nLabor demand per day: We assume that there is level demand for the month and that\nproduction is continuous. We calculate the number of required production hours for an\noperation by using the demand per month, number of work days per month, the fraction of the\ndemand that goes through the operation and the number of products produced per hour for the\noperation. Therefore, for a given operation:\n\nThe required production hours per day= Monthly demand*fraction / (number of work days per\nmonth*number products produced per hour)\n\nFor each operation, the actual hours have to be at least the required production hours.\n\nMachine capacity per shift: There are a limited number of machines for each operation and\nthese machines can be run only for 8 hours per shift with the exception of laser weld which can\nbe run for 7 hours (this machine is shared part-time with another production line). This capacity\nis the number of hours that the machine can be worked in a shift. The number of labor work\nhours spent on each operation must be less than the machine capacity. The machine\ncapacities are calculated by multiplying the number of machines with 8 since every shift lasts\nfor 8 hours, except for laser weld.\n\nNumber of workers for each shift: The number of workers for each shift has to be more than 5.\nTherefore for each shift the total number of labor hours is forced to be greater than 40 hrs,\nwhich is the total number of labor hours that can be contributed by 5 workers on each shift.\n\nWork hours by each grade vs. the available number of work hours at each grade level: This\nconstraint is applied by making the works hours at each grade level to be greater than or equal\nto the available work hours. This constraint causes each current worker to work to his/her\nmaximum capacity, before additional workers are hired.\n\nNon-negativity constraints for decision variables: applied when running the solver by using the\ncheck box toggle.\n\nObjective Function\n\nThe objective function of the model is to minimize the overall daily cost of production. The cost\nis calculated by adding up the cost of labor on each operation per shift. See Exhibit 3 for a\nlisting of all the labor costs. There is a $0.25 per hour premium paid on a second shift and a\n$0.75 per hour shift premium paid on third shift. There is also a premium of $0.50 per hour for\nthe work hours spent in the clean areas.\n\nOur Experiment with an Integer Model\n\nThe LP model provides the work hours required by each operation for each shift. These\nnumbers are allowed to be fractional and assume a perfect allocation of a worker. This,\nhowever, does not take into account the integrality of a worker since in reality there are a\ncertain number of workers in a shift and not just a number of work hours to be completed. To\ntry to solve this problem we created an Integer model. This model added the number of\nworkers for each grade and shift as decision variables to the LP model. The number of\nworkers was forced to be an integer and a constraint was added which required the number of\nhours worked for each grade level and for each shift to be equal to eight times the number of\nworkers.\n\nThis model was able to run for small demand quantities and returned an exact number of\nworkers. However as demand increased and multiple shifts were required, the model ran for\ntoo long to be practical. At a high demand level the solver ran for more than 10 hours without\nreturning a solution. Since there was only marginal benefit in this integer model we decided to\ncontinue all of our analysis with the simpler LP that optimized on an hourly basis. We assume\nthat a manager can take the required number of work hours and translate this into the number\nof workers that he needs to schedule.\n\nUse of the LP Model:\n\nMonthly Use:\n\nExhibit 7 shows the factory manager interface of our optimization model. Each month the\nmanager simply inputs the demand, number of days in the month, and current workforce and\nclicks solve. The model then produces the following outputs;\n\n-\nDaily Pay code Specific Staffing Hours: Indicates daily by-shift hours required by each pay\ncode and where (which operation) each pay code hour must be utilized in the factory in\norder to achieve lowest costs. This information is critical to monitor factory resources,\ninsuring the level loading of the factory.\n\n-\nDaily Operation Specific Staffing Hours: Indicates the by-shift total hours of each shift on\neach individual operation. Very useful at identifying shift-constrained operations.\n\n-\nDaily Overall Pay code Staffing Hours: Summary of total staffing hours for each pay code\nused to adjust pay code levels (training).\n\n-\nDaily Overall Shift Staffing Hours: Summary of total staffing hours on each shift used by\nmanagement/facilities to gauge level of operation for each shift.\n\n-\nDaily and Monthly Staffing Costs: Indicates the lowest cost per day/month for staffing given\ncurrent factory constraints.\n\nLong Range Planning:\n\nTarget Workforce\nThere are other important uses for the model in addition to daily and monthly scheduling. A\nsenior manager could use it to help determine exactly how many permanent workers to hold\non staff at each grade. When you run the model without any current workers, it shows the total\nnumber of hours required at each grade for a day. This can then be interpreted to give a rough\nidea of the total number of people required to do those jobs. For example, if demand is\nexpected to grow then the model can determine how many workers of each type you might\nwant to hire or train in advance of the increase to be well prepared. For a given demand, the\nideal number of hours is shown by the model.\n\nThere are also monthly variations in customer demand, which means that the ideal number of\nworkers to meet that demand will vary as well. Having a permanent staff of workers that is\ngreater than the ideal number required is an excess cost. However, there is also a tradeoff in\nthe cost to hire a new worker to meet demand (or lost revenue in not being able to produce\nenough). By running the model with different sets of permanent staff and then comparing the\ntotal overall labor costs, the manager can begin to understand this tradeoff (the cost of hiring\nor lost revenue is not known in this analysis, however).\n\nExhibit 6 shows this type of analysis with 4 different types of workforce: No permanent\nworkers, the number of workers required to meet demand of 25,000 units, workers required for\n35,000 and workers required for 45,000. In each case, demand was simulated in a range from\n10,000 to 75,000 units and the daily cost of labor was recorded. In this case we assumed that\n\nGrade 1 and Grade 2 workers could be easily hired, and that there is a permanent staff of\nGrade 3 to Grade 5 workers. Exhibit 6 shows the required workforce for each case.\n\nThe graph shows that there is a fixed cost for the permanent staff at low levels of demand, and\nthen it becomes variable at higher levels of demand. For example, with a large permanent\nworkforce, the plant is using Grade 3 to 5 workers (the permanent staff) for all jobs until\ndemand is above about 25,000 units. This is not as cost efficient as having Grade 1 and 2\nworkers to do the lower skill jobs. We see that at higher levels of demand that all of the costs\nconverge. This, however, does not take into account the fixed cost of hiring new workers\nbeyond their hourly wage. Above 45,000 units, the large workforce would still need to be\naugmented with new workers. This graph would be very useful for a manager deciding at what\nlevel to keep a permanent number of workers. It shows that excess cost of holding too large a\nworkforce when demand does not fully utilize these workers to their highest skills.\n\nWhile the true number of workers in the plant would vary, this would help the manager to set a\ntarget workforce. The model is an excellent planning tool for hiring and setting training\npolicies.\n\nPlant and Machine Capacity\nThe model also provides information about machine capacities in the plant. By looking at\nallocation of people to machine resources we can quickly see the bottlenecks. With increasing\ndemand, the most constraining resource is the one that causes a second shift (and then 3rd) to\nstart up. In our model the constraint is the Vacuum Bake/Tig Weld operation. In addition to\nother analytical tools available, the model can help the manager to see the constraining\nresources in the plant.\n\nThis information also can show the tradeoff in making new capital investment versus operating\nmore shifts. There is a significant cost to having a second or third shift and depending upon\nthe cost of making a capital investment it may or may not be wise to increase capacity. For\nexample, it may be relatively inexpensive to invest in a new Vacuum Bake machine and the\ncost of this machine would be quick made up by the fact that the plant would not have to\noperate a second shift. The model helps the manager to better understand these tradeoffs.\n\nLP Model Limitations\n\nWhile the model is very effective at producing the above outputs given a monthly demand,\nthere are several limitations to the model and we must remember the model is a forecasting\ntool. The model does not account for factory variability such as down machines, training,\nvacations, sick-leave, hiring limitations, or part defects. Statistical data must be analyzed in\nconjunction with the LP model to reduce the risk of factory variation. Also, you will notice the\nmodel works in hours per pay code, not employees per pay code. As discussed earlier, we\nattempted to add this feature into model, but were unsuccessful given our modeling software\nand computer power. So when the LP model, as in Exhibit 7, indicates you need to bring in a\npay code 4 on 2nd shift to do only 1.86 hours of work, obviously the manager should use the\n\nremaining 6.14 hours of the workers time doing other pay code 3, 2, or 1 work. Knowledge of\nthe above limitations simply means to use the model together with past data and common\nsense to create and effective tool for forecasting staffing levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the monthly variable demand in precision thermostat units and the complex pay scheme\nfor the various pay codes as they relate to shifts, work environment, and training, the\nconstructed LP model is an effective tool for planning optimal staffing levels. Along with\noptimizing monthly staffing levels the LP model can be used for long range planning to develop\na target permanent workforce as well as plant and machine optimal capacities. Direct results\nof this analysis are workforce training/hiring requirements and future capital investments.\nOverall, the LP Model accomplished our objective, to create a forecasting tool which could\nallocate labor on a manufacturing line.\n\nExhibit 1: Sample Device Styles\n\n(Images of six Klixon thermostats.)\n\nSort pins\nWeld\nconnector\nVacuum bake\nand tig weld\nLaser weld\nCalibrate\n(3)\nDisc\nassemble\nWeld arm\nto header\nWeld contact\nto header\nExhibit 2\nWeld contact\nto arm\n40%\nWire\nleads (2)\nInspection\nand write up\nQC\nHypot test\n(2)\nCreep test\n(3)\nTemp\ncheck (5)\nCode\nLeak check\n60%\nTin dip\nBend\nterminals\n25%\n40%\n10%\n15%\n75%\nClean room\n100K\n( ) indicate # of\nworkstations greater\nthan 1\nClean room\n25%\n10%\n\nExhibit 3\nPay Rates\nJob\nGrade\nBase pay\nrate/hour\nFirst Shift\nbase rate\nFirst Shift\nclean\nroom rate\nSecond\nShift base\nrate\nSecond\nshift clean\nroom rate\nThird\nShift base\nrate\nThird\nShift\nclean\nroom rate\n8.00\n8.00\n8.50\n8.25\n8.75\n8.75\n9.25\n9.00\n9.00\n9.50\n9.25\n9.75\n9.75\n10.25\n14.00\n14.00\n14.50\n14.25\n14.75\n14.75\n15.25\n18.00\n18.00\n18.50\n18.25\n18.75\n18.75\n19.25\n20.00\n20.00\n20.50\n20.25\n20.75\n20.75\n21.25\n\nExhibit 4\nCapacity and Job grade by operation\nOperation\npcs/hour\n#\nstations\nGrade\n\nOperation\npcs/hour\n#\nstations\nGrade\nSort pins\nN/A\n\nCode\nWeld\ncontact to\nheader\n\nTemp test\nWeld\ncontact to\narm\n\nCreep test\nWeld arm\nto header\n\nHypot test\nDisc\nassemble\nN/A\n\nBend terminals\nCalibrate\n\nWeld wire\nleads\nLaser\nweld\n\nTin dip\nVac\nbake/tig\nweld\n\nWeld connector\nLeak\ncheck\n\nInspection/write\nup\nN/A\n\nExhibit 5\n\nIndexes\ni = index for employee job grade level.

      "content": "15.066 Pump System Design\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo:\n\nProfessor Graves\n\nFrom:\nTeam 3 - Tammy Greenlaw, Chris Caballero, Aaron Raphel,\nMinja Penttila, Cliff Smith\n\nDate:\nAugust, 2003\n\nRe:\n\n15.066 - System Optimization\n\nPump System Design: Optimizing Total Cost over System Life Cycle\n\nExecutive Summary\nTraditionally, pump and pipe systems are designed by beginning with a given pipe design (diameter\nand physical layout). The pump is then selected for the pipe layout by considering the operating\ncosts for the pump and the capital costs of the pipe. Additionally, the pumps are often designed by\nengineering consultants who oversize the pumps for the system to guarantee that pump is not\nundersized. Unfortunately, this causes poor efficiencies and, consequently, higher operating costs.\nWe believe that an improved methodology includes:\n1. Selecting the pipe design concurrently with the pump design\n2. Including the capital costs of the pumps in the life cycle cost analysis during the system\ndesign\n\nThe utility of this methodology was demonstrated by using a linear, integer optimization model to\nselect optimal combinations of pipe systems and pump systems.\n\nThe optimization model was then extended to assess the impact of various energy rate structures\nand potential (pending) tax implementations on carbon emissions. These analyses did show how\ncertain \"price-break\" structures give incentives to build less-efficient pump and pipe systems.\n\nBackground\nThe total energy in a pumping system moving water from Point A to Point B in a full pipe at a\nconstant flowrate (Q) can be calculated at any point in the pipe using the Bernoulli equation.\n\nPA + VA\n2/2g + ZA = PB + VB\n2/2g + ZB + Hf\n\nwhere:\nPX = Pressure\nVX = Velocity\ng = Gravitational constant\nZX = Elevation\nHf = Energy lost as heat due to friction\n\nIf you consider only conditions at Points A and B, one can assume that the velocity at Point A\n(pump) and the velocity at Point B (exit) is zero, and assume that pressure at Point B is zero\n(atmospheric pressure), the equation simplifies to:\n\nPA = Hf + ∆Z\n\nPA is the pressure that the pump must add to move water from Point A to Point B at flow Q. PA is\nusually expressed in feet (similar to inches of mercury) and referred to as System Head (H) or Total\n\n15.066 Pump System Design\nDynamic Head (TDH). ∆Z is the change is elevation from Point A to Point B. Where ∆Z is\npositive, water is pumped to a higher elevation and energy is stored as potential energy. Where ∆Z\nis negative, PA is reduced or water flows by gravity. Hf is also expressed in feet and often referred\nto as Frictional Loss or Headloss due to friction. Hf is the amount of energy lost as heat due to the\nfriction of water moving along pipe walls or fittings. In industrial pumping, most pumping energy\nis actually spent overcoming frictional losses (Hawken, et. al, p. 115). Appendix X shows the\nfrictional loss and elevation change calculations used to generate System Head values for each pipe\ndiameter at flow Q. Frictional losses are calculated along straight pipe and through fittings as\nfollows:\n\nFittings:\nHf = kV2/2g\n(See Appendix B1 for further details)\nPipe:\nHf = fLV2 / 2gD\n\nFluid flow in full pipes can be expressed as:\n\nQ = VA\nwhere:\nQ = Flowrate\n\nV = Velocity\n\nA = Cross-sectional area of pipe\n\nTherefore, at a constant flowrate (Q), velocity (V) can be reduced by increasing the pipe diameter.\nSince frictional energy losses along straight pipe and through fittings are directly proportional to V2,\nincreasing pipe diameter significantly reduces frictional losses.\n\nProject Summary\nWe have created a linear, integer model to aid in the concurrent selection of a pump size and a pipe\ndiameter. The model optimizes the pumping system design by selecting two components, pump size\nand pipe diameter, based on their impact on the system life cycle costs. Binary decision variables\ninclude four pump options and four pipe diameter options; the program is structured to pick one\npump and one pipe option to minimize the life cycle costs (Z) as follows:\n\nMinimize Z = Cj + Ci + n x Com\nwhere:\nCj = Capital costs to purchase and install pump,\nCi = Capital costs to purchase and install pipe, fittings, and valves),\nCom = Operating costs due to pump energy consumed over assumed life cycle,\nn = Life cycle in years\n\nPreliminary engineering calculations provided performance and capital cost parameters for each\npiping configuration option and pump size option. Performance parameters including pump\nefficiency (ηp), motor efficiency (ηm), and system head are used to calculate the annual energy\nconsumption for any combinations of pump and pipe diameter. Capital cost estimates for each\npump option and each pipe option are utilized directly as part of the objective function. The main\nengineering assumptions made to calculate energy consumption and capital costs for each\ncombination of pump and pipe options are:\n\n-\nFlow (Q) is constant at 750 gallons per minute (gpm)\n-\nThe pump is centrifugal with On/Off controls\n-\nTotal pipe length is 400 linear feet + fittings and valves\n-\nPipe is Schedule 40 steel with grooved connections\n-\nPoint B is 40 feet higher (elevation) than Point A\n\n15.066 Pump System Design\n-\nThe pump is running continuously (95% service factor)\n-\nLife Cycle = 20 years\n\nFour energy cost structure options are modeled to convert energy consumption (kwh) to annual\noperating costs. Table 1 shows the Option 1 rate structure that decreases in a step-wise fashion\nwith increasing energy use. This option represents a simplified public utility rate structure that\nprovides volume discounts. The unit cost function is not continuous, i.e. if a customer purchases a\nvolume of energy that puts them in the higher consumption bracket, they pay the lower unit cost for\ntheir total energy consumption. Table 2 shows the resulting Total Cost function for Option 1.\nOption 1 Energy Rate Structure\n$0.04\n$0.06\n$0.08\n$0.10\n$0.12\n$0.14\n$0.16\nAnnual Energy Use (kwh)\nU nit C ost ($/kwh)\n\nOption 1 - Price Breaks from Electric Company\nKW H\n0 to 500k KWH\n500k to 1M KWH\n1M KWH +\n\nTable 1: Option 1 Unit Energy Costs\n\nTable 2: Option 1 Total Energy Cost Function\n\nTable 3 shows the Option 2 rate structure that increases in a step-wise fashion. This option\nrepresents an industrial facility that produces its own power on site. Their unit costs vary based on\nthe assumed efficiency of their power boilers; the lowest unit cost represents power produced by\ntheir most efficient boiler; the mid-range unit cost represents power produced by a less efficient\nboiler; the highest unit cost assumes they must purchase energy from a public utility. Table 4\nshows the resulting Option 2 total cost function.\n\nOption 2 Energy Rate Structure\n$0.04\n$0.06\n$0.08\n$0.10\n$0.12\n$0.14\n$0.16\nAnnual Energy Use (kwh)\nU n it C o st ($/kw h )\nOption 2 - Internal Power Generation\nKWH\nTotal Cost ($)\n0 to 500k KWH\n500k to 1M KWH\n1M KWH +\n\nTable 3: Option 2 Unit Energy Costs\n\nTable 4: Option 2 Total Energy Cost Function\n\n15.066 Pump System Design\nThe final energy rate options represent situations where the industrial facility must evaluate the\nprobability that legislation implementing a carbon tax will be passed five years after the system is\ninstalled. These options assume that the facility purchases their power from a coal-fired power\nplant with a flat base rate or the base rate structure given in Option 1, or utilizes on-site coal-fired\nboilers as modeled in Option 2; in both cases, we assumed that the carbon tax costs will be directly\nabsorbed by the energy consumer. Based on the 1999 Department of Energy report on Carbon\nDioxide Emissions from the Generation of Electric Power in the United States, the average carbon\nemission per kwh produced at coal-fired power plants is 0.57 lbs C/kwh. Based on regional\nproposals to tax emissions, we modeled a probabilistic case where there is a 50% probability of no\ncarbon tax being implemented, a 30% probability of a moderate carbon tax being implemented\n($5/1000 lb C), and a 20% probability of a more aggressive carbon tax being implemented ($20/\n1000 lb C). In both cases, the probability of a carbon tax increases the unit cost rates.\n\nProject Selection\n\"Motors use three-fifths of the world's electricity. Pumping systems use at least a fifth of their total\noutput. In industrial pumping, most of the motors energy is actually spent in fighting against\nfriction. Traditional optimization compares the cost of fatter pipe with only the value of the saved\npumping energy. This comparison ignores the size, and hence the capital cost, of the equipment -\npump, motor, motor-drive circuits, and electrical supply components - needed to combat the pipe\nfriction.\" (Natural Capitalism, Hawken et al, 1999)\n\nWe chose a project that expands on a recent engineering design idea that allows an industrial\nfacility to minimize costs and reduce environmental impact simultaneously. Industrial pump system\ndesign has not changed significantly since the development of mechanical pumps. Appendix D is\nan excerpt from the book Natural Capitalism in which the authors refer to a simple, updated method\nof designing pumping systems that differs from the traditional method.

Additionally, our model\nconsiders the impact of different electricity rate structures on pumping system design decisions.\n\n15.066 Pump System Design\nResults\nIn order to determine whether including the pump capital costs in the life cycle cost analysis had an\nimpact on the results, we set the Option 1 model energy rates to a flat rate and optimized two cases,\n(1) pump capital costs included in the objective function, and (2) pump capital costs set to $0. With\nthe number of pumping systems (n) equal set to 5 and the life cycle set to 15 years, including the\npump capital costs in the life cycle analysis changed shifted the results as shown in Table X.\n\nNumber of\nSystems -\nn\nDecision\nVariable\nDesign\nResults\nEnergy\nConsumption\n(kwh)\nLife Cycle\nCost\nPump Cost\n(add if not\nincluded in\noptimization)\n\nTotal\nSystem\nLife Cycle\nCost\nLife\nCycle -\nt (yrs.)\nOptimization\nincludes pump\ncapital costs\nP2D4\n$ 641,099\n$ 177,000\n$ 818,099\nNo\nP1D5\n$ 810,617\n$ -\n$ 810,617\nYes\nDelta\n\n$ 7,482\n\nDelta lbs Carbon\n\nTable X: Flat Rate ($0.07/kwh) Results with and without Pump Capital Costs included in Optimization\n\nWe ran Option 1 a number of times varying number of pumping systems in order to observe the\nimpact of the decreasing step power rate structure.

Including pump capital costs in the life cycle analysis may\nor may not impact design decisions depending on factors such as the length of the life cycle, and\npiping capital costs relative to pump capital costs. However, taking the proposed systems design\napproach has the potential to decrease life cycle costs and energy consumption and should be\nutilized particularly in situations where pipe diameter is not constrained by other criteria (i.e.\nminimum fluid velocity or average fluid time in system).\n\nGiven our assumed system, power rate structures have the potential to impact life cycle analysis and\nsubsequent design decisions. The exact impact is specific to the situation and rate structure applied.\n\nThe model is effective in optimizing the assumed pumping system and illustrating that current\nengineering design practices may be improved, but it is not practical for repetitive or complicated\nhydraulic modeling. Although all of our assumptions are reasonable, they limit the analysis in order\nto be fit to a linear program. Alternatively, existing hydraulic modeling software could be modified\nto include the system life cycle analysis illustrated in this program or the linear program could be\nmodified to further analyze the results of existing modeling software.\n\n15.066 Pump System Design\n\nAppendix A: Model Formulation and Figures (CC)\n\nAppendix B: Engineering Calculations\nB1: System Head Equations and Spreadsheet Calculations (TG)\nB2: System and Pump Performance Curves (TG)\nB3: Energy Consumption Equations (TG)\nB4: Piping Cost Estimates (CS)\nB5: Pump Cost Estimates (CS)\n\nAppendix C: Natural Capitalism Excerpt (TG)\n\n15.066 Pump System Design\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nModel Formulation and Figures\n\n15.066 Pump System Design\n\nVariables\nCi -

Graves\nTeam Members:\nBrian Siefering\nAmber Mazooji\nKevin McKenney\nPaul Mingardi\nVikram Sahney\nKaz Maruyama\n\nIntroduction\nEach summer, boat owners flock to marinas to sign up for a mooring spot to tie up their\nboats. A mooring is a buoy that is anchored to the ocean floor for the purpose of securing\na boat for storage. A picture of a mooring is shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 is a diagram of\na mooring buoy and anchor line. A typical marina is shown in Figure 3, where moorings\nare positioned in a grid like pattern.\n(Photo removed for publication.)\nFigure 1. Picture of Boat on a Mooring.\nMooring Buoy\nMooring Line\nLine Secured to Bedrock\nFigure 2. Diagram of Mooring Buoy and Anchor Line.\n(Photo removed for publication.)\nFigure 3. Typical Marina Mooring Layout.\nEach summer, many marina customers are put on waiting lists because the\nmooring supply cannot always meet the demand. Whether or not a customer gets a\nmooring and where the mooring is located is based strictly on seniority. As customers\nwith optimal mooring locations leave the marina, their moorings are handed down to the\ncustomers who have been with the marina the longest. Mooring that are freed up are then\nreleased to customers on the waiting list.\n\nAdditionally, the same moorings are placed in the same grid locations from year\nto year. Boats are then assigned on a first come first serve basis as previously described\nwithout taking into account variables which distinguish between boats. This propagates\nthe sub-optimal usage of the marina water space. By instead taking into account\nvariables such as boat length, hull depth, and mooring location, a marina can optimize\ntheir revenues while maximizing the number of satisfied customers.\nProblem Description\nThe goal of this optimization program is to maximize revenue for the assignment\nof boat moorings at a marina. The model was based on the marina shown in Figure 4.\nThe marina is modeled as a rectangular harbor as shown in Figure 5 with a manifest of\nboats of different lengths and hull depths. The black dots represent the boat locations\nwhile the dotted circles represent the circle that the boat swings through under varying\ntide and wind conditions. The depth of the water in the marina increases as y increases\nfrom the dock to the channel. The costs of mooring positions in the harbor are based on\nthe vicinity to both the dock and to the ocean channel. In other words, customers desire\ntheir boats to be close to the dock so that it takes less time to row out to their boat.\nAdditionally, if the boat is closer to the marina exit, it will take less time for the customer\nto exit the harbor. Mooring costs are dependent on the swing radius that the boat\noccupies as well as the depth of the water the boat requires.\nChannel\nDock\nFigure 4.

This\nrelationship was chosen in order to impose a realistic constraint on the mooring\nplacement problem. Harbor bottoms are generally non-uniform and, in addition,\nmay be non-linear. The problem can quite easily be adapted to any new harbor\nocean floor equation.\n2) Moorings can be precisely placed. Mooring anchors are placed by divers and\nmay not be placed exactly in the desired location. This model contains a buffer\nterm which will be introduced later and which will accommodate for some\nuncertainty. For the most part, however, this model ignores such variability.\n3) Mooring lines are weightless. In reality, mooring cables have a mass which cause\nthe line to sag in the water, decreasing the overall distance from the anchor to the\nmooring. The model assumes that the cables can be stretched out straight, which\naccommodates for the longest cable length and as a result, the worst case\nscenario.\n4) Moorings can and will be moved every year. This is a reasonable assumption for\nmoorings in the northeast as they are removed each winter to protect them from\nthe elements. In a tropical environment, this assumption may not be valid\nbecause the moorings are left in the water year in and year out.\n5) Tide change is 2 feet or less. This is based on actual data for the harbor chosen,\nhowever this constraint can vary quite significantly between geographic locations\nand even between nearby harbors.\n6) At high tide, the mooring line angle is 30o . When a boat is attached to a mooring\nand subjected to a horizontal force (either wind or tide), the mooring will be\npulled to one side causing the mooring line to settle at some angle from vertical.\nIf the line is too short, the buoy will be pulled under water and the line will be\nsubjected to unnecessarily high tension. This can be alleviated by providing slack\nin the line. We have assumed in this model that an angle of 300 from the vertical\nis sufficient for uninhibited mooring operation.\n7) Boats are between 15' and 40' in length. These boats were then bundled into\nthree groups: 15'-20', 20'-30', and 30'-40'. This is a reasonable assumption\nbecause boats under 15' do not usually require moorings. Boats that are greater\nthan 40' generally are docked at the more expensive slips.\n8) The minimum separation needed between boat sweeps is five feet. This is\nessentially a buffer space. In other words, in the worst case scenario, when\nadjacent boats swing in opposite directions, they will come no closer than a\ndistance of five feet.\n9) Boats will be able to leave moorings without specified lanes designated in a\nmarina. This is a reasonable assumption to a certain degree. Because boats will\ntend to drift in the same direction due to the wind and tide directions, as shown in\nFigure 3, there will be a natural gap between moored boats though which moving\nboats may maneuver. There may however be governmental regulations on the\nspacing that we have not accounted for.\n10) Boats are classified into two categories based on their hull depth: boats with hull\ndepths less than 4' and boats with hull depths between 4' and 8'. Sailboats and\n\nlong boats tend to have larger hull depth (draft), but typically not greater than 8'\nfor the given boat length assumed in the model.\n11) The bow line length is negligible. The bow line connects the boat to the mooring.\nThe distance is typically on the order of 2-6 feet, however it does not connect to\nthe tip of the boat. As a result, boats tips tend to hang directly over the mooring,\nsimplifying the calculation.\n\nInput Matrix\nThe model will allow the user to input up to eighteen different boats as well as several\nmarina characteristics. The number of boats allowed is limited by the number of\nconstraints that can be handled by Excel's premium solver (250 non-linear constraints).\nAn add-on module would increase this number significantly. The boat and marina inputs\nare as follows:\n1. Boat Length - length of boat from bow to stern in feet.\n2. Boat Hull Depth - the amount of water the boat needs to operate.\n3. Hull depth categories - shallow (<4 ft) or deep draft (4-8 ft).\n4. Hull depth cost - amount the marina will charge for each hull depth category.\n5. Length categories - short (15-20 ft), medium (20-30 ft), or long (30-40 ft).\n6. Length cost - amount the marina will charge for each boat length category.\n7. Theta high - minimum angle to vertical seen by mooring line at high tide.\n8. Tide change - difference between high and low tide in feet.\n9. Harbor boundary - Minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates (in feet)\nindicating the harbor boundary.\n10. Buffer - minimum distance between adjacent boats at worst case sweeps.\nTable 1.

Because it has been assumed that the harbor water depth\nincreases linearly as y increases, the depth (zi ) for each boat i is given by the following\nequation,\nzi = D min + ⎢\n⎡(D max -D min )\n⎥\n⎤ y\nfor y\n< y < y\n( 2 )\ni\nmin\ni\nmax\ny\n⎣\nmax\n⎦\nBoat Sweep Radius\nThe next calculation relates the boat sweep radius (r ) to the harbor depth, the tide\n,\n2 i\nvariation ( )\nT , the minimum mooring line angle (θ ), the length of the boat ( )\nL , and the\nbuffer length ( )\nB as shown in the following equation which is based on the variables\nillustrated in Figure 6,\nhi = zi + T\n( 3 )\ncosθ1\nr ,1 i = zi tanθ2\n( 4 )\n⎡\n⎛z ⎞⎤\n=\narccos\ntan\n⎜ ⎟⎥+ Li + B\n( 5 )\nr ,\n2 i\nzi\n⎢⎣\n⎝h ⎠⎦\nDepth, z\nh\nh\nBuoy\nBuffer, B\nθ1\nθ2\nTide, T\nr1\nBoat\nLength, L\nSea level with high tide\nSea level with low tide\nSwing Radius, r\nFigure 6. Mooring Line Swing Radius Diagram.\n\nBoat Hull Depth Interference\nThe minimum water depth necessary to prevent the boat hull from colliding with the\nharbor sea floor must be maintained through the boat's entire swing radius. In other\nwords, at the shallowest point of the boats swing radius, there must be enough water for\nthe boat to float. This constraint is shown in the equation below,\n⎛ D max - D min ⎟⎟⎞(yi - r ,\n2 i )- D > 0\nD min +\n⎝⎜⎜\nY max\n⎠\ni\nMooring Location Boundary\nIn order to ensure that all boats are placed in a region within the marina, all xi and yi\nmust be bounded by the maximum and minimum X and Y coordinates as shown in the\nfollowing equations,\nxi + r ,\n2 i < X\n∀i\n( 6 )\nmax\nxi - r ,\n2 i < X min\n∀i\n( 7 )\nyi + r ,\n2 i < Y\n∀i\n( 8 )\nmax\nyi - r ,\n2 i < Y min\n∀i\n( 9 )\nMooring Sweep Radius Interference Prevention\nThe following constraint prevents each boat from colliding with any other boat in the\nmarina by insisting that the distance between mooring locations accommodates for the\nboat sweep radius for each boat. This is accomplished using the following equation,\n(x - xk ) + (y - y ) > r ,\n2 i + rk\n∀k\ni\n= i\n( 10 )\ni\ni\nk\n,\nImplementing this set of constraints will result in a triangular matrix because of the\nredundancy associated with testing for interference between boats one and two and\nbetween two and one.\nDock and Harbor Channel Proximity Price\nThe desirability of mooring location is a function of the proximity to the dock as well as\nto the harbor channel exit. It is desirable for the mooring to be located near the dock\nbecause customers will have less distance to row from the dock to their respective boats.\nAdditionally, it is desirable for the mooring to be located near the harbor channel exit\nbecause customers will have less distance to travel at no wake speed to exit the harbor.\nIn essence, this is a convenience charge. The model takes this into account by assigning\na linear cost function associated with distance from the dock and distance from the harbor\nchannel exit. The model takes the minimum and maximum prices charged for both\nharbor and exit proximity and calculates a price rate. These price rate calculations are\nshown below:\n\nPD\nPD max\n,\n- PD min\n,\n( 11\n\n)\n=\nDT\nPC\nPC max\n,\n- PC min\n,\n( 12\n\n)\n=\nDT\nwhere,\nDT =\n(X\n- X min ) + (Y\n- Ymin )\n\n( 13 )\nmax\nmax\nChannel Proximity Pricing\n(X\n,Y\n)\nx\ny\nP\n(X\n,Y\n)\nDock\nEntrance\nChannel\nmin\nmin\nIso-Price\nLines\nDecreasing\nPrice Gradient\nC,max\nmax\nmax\nFigure 8. As the mooring placement moves farther from the dock, the desirability to the\ncustomer decrease as well as the proximity fee associated with this location. Likewise, as\nthe mooring placement moves farther from the harbor channel exit, the desirability to the\ncustomer will decrease as well as the proximity fee associated with this location. The\niso-pricing lines are circular lines representing regions of constant mooring proximity\nprice. Figure 9 shows the combined proximity pricing for both dock and harbor channel\nexit.

Combined Proximity Pricing.\n\nObjective Function\nThe objective function for this model is based on optimizing the marina revenue from\nmooring fees. These fees are based on three criteria as follows:\n1. Length of Boat. There is a flat fee for boats in each of the three length categories.\nLF =\nFee\nLength\n= ∑∑ L\nP\ni, j\n( 14\n\n)\nj\nj\ni\n2. Depth of Boat. There is a fee for boats requiring eight feet of water depth.\nDF =\nFee\nDepth\n= ∑ PH 1Di + PH 2 (1 - D )\n( 15\n\n)\ni\ni\n3. Proximity to Dock and Channel Exit. There is a variable fee that is a function of\nhow close the mooring location is to the dock.\nDPF = Dock Pr\nFee\noximity\n= ∑ PD max\n,\n- PD ( X\n- xi ) + ( Y\n- y )\n( 16 )\nmax\nmin\ni\ni\n4.

There is a variable fee that is a function of\nhow close the mooring location is to the harbor channel exit.\nCPF = Channel Pr\nFee\noximity\n= ∑ PC max\n,\n- PC ( Y\n- y ) + ( X\n- xi )\n( 17 )\nmax\ni\nmin\ni\nThe objective function is to maximize the sum of these individual fees:\nFee\nMooring\n= LF + DF + DPF + CPF\n( 18\n\n)\n\nModel\nThe model was set up in Excel as a non-linear program. The maximum number of boats\nthat could be solved for using Excel's premium solver was 18 due to the high number of\nconstraints. The problem was solved using the multi-start option. Additionally, it was\nrun several times with many different seeds in order to ensure convergence on a more\nglobal optimum.\nAs a realistic check on the model, several test runs were performed using only a fraction\nof the constraints. Some of these trial runs are described below and are consistent with\nengineering intuition.\n\nTest Run 1 - Constant Harbor Depth and No Channel Exit Fee\nIn the first test run, the harbor depth was fixed at 12 feet. This would provide no location\npreference for large or small boats. Additionally, the mooring swing radius ( ) would be\nr1\na constant and the boat swing radius (r ) would only be a function of boat length ( )\nLi .\nThis would provide a fairly uniform spacing between mooring. Additionally, the price\nassociated with the harbor channel exit fee (PC ) was excluded. This would cause the\nboats to accumulate in the vicinity of the dock. Figure 10 plots the results of running the\noptimization for this test model. As expected, the optimization has clustered the\nmoorings near the dock. The total revenue due to mooring fees recognized by the marina\nwas maximized to $7,337.73.\nTest 1 - Fixed water depth, no harbor exit fee\nY Coordinate\n509, 225\n231, 46\n188, 231\n162, 128\n209, 336\n358, 217\n509, 36\n434, 210\n423, 46\n327, 55\n383, 134\n281, 257\n303, 405\n489, 320\n373, 312\n489, 130\n277, 149\n424, 417\nX Coordinate\nFigure 10. Test 1 - Fixed Water Depth, No Harbor Exit Fee.\n\nTest Run 2 - Constant Harbor Depth and No Dock Fee\nIn the second test run, the harbor depth was again fixed at 12 feet, providing no location\npreference for large or small boats and the boat swing radius (r ) would only be a\nfunction of boat length ( )\nLi , providing a fairly uniform spacing between mooring. This\ntime, the price associated with the dock proximity fee (PD ) was excluded. This would\ncause the boats to accumulate in the vicinity of the harbor channel exit. Figure 11 plots\nthe results of running the optimization for this test model. As expected, the optimization\nhas clustered the moorings near the harbor channel exit. The total revenue due to\nmooring fees recognized by the marina was maximized to $7,323.70. Because test two\nreplaces one constraint with another very similar constraint, this revenue of the two tests\nare roughly equivalent.\nTest 2 - Fixed water depth, no dock fee\nY Coordinate\n43, 356\n41, 509\n41, 433\n51, 249\n108, 396\n125, 311\n144, 197\n135, 489\n215, 277\n216, 119\n310, 399\n308, 303\n204, 383\n252, 489\n287, 198\n369, 488\n396, 241\n408, 357\nX Coordinate\nFigure 11. Test 2 - Fixed Water Depth, No Dock Fee.\n\nTest Run 3 - Fixed Harbor Depth, Equal Proximity Pricing\nIn the third test run, the harbor depth was again fixed at 12 feet, providing no location\npreference for large or small boats and the boat swing radius (r ) would only be a\nfunction of boat length ( )\nLi , providing a fairly uniform spacing between mooring. This\ntime, the price associated with the dock proximity fee (PD ) and harbor exit proximity fee\nwere weighted equally. This would cause the boats to accumulate along the line\nconnecting the two locations. Figure 12 plots the results of running the optimization for\nthis test model. As expected, the optimization has clustered the moorings in a football\nshaped line connecting the dock with the harbor exit. The mooring locations are fairly\nsymmetric about this line. The total revenue due to mooring fees recognized by the\nmarina was maximized to $7,057.58. This is slightly smaller than test runs 1 and 2\nbecause we have added an additional constraint.\nTest 3 - Fixed water depth, equal dock and\nharbor channel exit fee\nY Coordinate\n76, 406\n51, 499\n98, 301\n194, 298\n144, 474\n169, 381\n173, 203\n263, 239\n269, 316\n259, 439\n272, 143\n332, 272\n366, 193\n392, 99\n428, 280\n471, 171\n489, 56\n351, 367\nX Coordinate\nFigure 12. Test 3 - Fixed Water Depth, Equal Proximity Pricing.\n\nTest Run 4 - Variable water depth\nIn the fourth test run, the harbor depth was assigned a very gradual slope, providing only\na small section of the harbor near the channel in which the deep hulled boat could be\nplaced. Additionally, the price associated with the harbor exit proximity fee (\n) was\nPC\neliminated. Figure 13 plots the results of running the optimization for this test model. As\nexpected, the optimization has clustered the short boats near the dock and placed the deep\nboats out near the channel where the water is deep enough to accommodate them. The\ntotal revenue due to mooring fees recognized by the marina was maximized to $6,902.05.\nBecause such a strict constraint was placed on the deep hulled boats the revenue was\nmuch less than test runs 1 and 2.\nTest 4 - Variable water depth, no exit proximity fee\nY Coordinate\n125, 454\n227, 444\n196, 542\n290, 139\n392, 274\n378, 31\n464, 118\n375, 207\n462, 274\n454, 41\n410, 552\n453, 196\n296, 217\n376, 118\n292, 51\n307, 565\n441, 454\n329, 454\nX Coordinate\nFigure 13. Test 4 - Slightly Variable Harbor Floor, no harbor exit fee.\n\nResults and Analysis\nIn order to evaluate the mooring optimization results, a baseline model of a typical\nmarina mooring layout was created. The mooring placement is such that all the moorings\ntake into account the worst case scenario so that any boat can be placed in any mooring\nlocation. The moorings are laid out in a grid as shown in Figure 14. Although very\nsimple to implement, this layout is extremely inefficient. Only 16 of the 18 boats could\nbe placed in the harbor under these constraints and the marina revenue was only\n$5,523.56.\nTypical Marina with Grid Moorings\nY Coordinate\n139, 61\n139, 177\n139, 294\n139, 411\n256, 61\n256, 177\n256, 294\n256, 411\n373, 61\n373, 177\n373, 294\n373, 411\n489, 61\n489, 177\n489, 294\n489, 411\nX Coordinate\nFigure 14. Typical Marina with Grid Moorings.\nAfter confirming the validity of the model using the intuition gained from the test results,\nthe overall system parameters were input and the model optimization was solved. The\nresults are shown in Figure 15. The main differences between this model and the test\nmodels are that this model accounts for a realistic variable representing water depth and\ncontains a proximity fee weighted more heavily towards the dock. The latter assumption\nis based on the fact that if customers were given the choice, they would rather have less\ndistance to row out to their boat and sacrifice being closer to the harbor exit.\n\nMarina Mooring Optimization with 18 Boats\nY Coordinate\n513, 118\n255, 206\n428, 31\n449, 96\n512, 188\n469, 244\n501, 319\n371, 84\n330, 237\n311, 149\n504, 41\n399, 329\n279, 51\n343, 427\n410, 176\n287, 329\n174, 329\n470, 417\nX Coordinate\nFigure 15. Marian Mooring Optimization with 18 Boats.\nAs expected, the optimization has placed the boats in the vicinity of the dock with a slight\nbias towards deeper water so as to accommodate the deeper hulled boats. It can also be\nseen from the figure that the swing radii nearest the dock are shorter than those farther\nout towards the channel. This is due to two factors. The first is that the mooring line\nlength is shorter in shallower water. As the tide goes out, this results in a shorter swing\nradius variation than for moorings in deeper water. Additionally, the optimization has\nmade an effort to place the shorter length boats near the dock because the more it can\nsqueeze in, the higher the revenue will be. From strictly a revenue standpoint, this is a\ngood strategy, however, in reality, owners of larger and longer boats tend to have the\ndeepest pockets and overwhelming desires for convenience and superiority. In a future\nversion of the model, it is recommended that there be separate proximity price schemes\nfor each of the boat length categories. In other words, in order to satisfy the customers\nand to allow the larger boats spots near the dock, the associated proximity fees should be\nappropriately penalized.\nThe results of the optimization are quite impressive. The revenue of $6,703.93 is 21.4%\ngreater than the revenue recognized with the standard marina mooring layout.\nAdditionally, the optimization has only used a fraction of the harbor area to place the 18\nboats, freeing up space to accommodate additional boats which would only increase\nrevenues. Unfortunately, under the constraint limitations of the Excel Premium Solver\nthe model was unable to add more boats in order to assign a value to the true revenue\nincreases. Add on modules that would increase the number of allowable constraints that\nare available.\nAs a last recommendation for the implementation of this mooring placement\noptimization, it would be convenient to have a boat adding algorithm that attempted to\n\ninclude the next boat on the waiting list before settling on an optimum. In other words,\nafter solving for 18 boats, the model would then attempt to include a nineteenth boat and\nso on until no more boats would fit into the harbor. In this fashion, the model could\npotentially optimize not only the marina revenue, but also the number of boats in the\nharbor, and the number of satisfied customers."

      "content": "Apollo Paper Company\nCharles DeWitt\nIntroduction\nApollo Corporation is a paper manufacturer that sells medium-quality paper in a variety\nof sizes. In early 1992, Apollo decided to develop a high-quality paper, named Elite, to\nround out its product line. With a late 1992 introduction planned for Elite, Apollo's\noperations division had only eight months to set up the paper's manufacturing process.\nBecause of tight schedule constraints, the optimization of the processes was relegated to a\nlater time.\nThe Elite paper was heavier, glossier, and whiter that the medium-quality papers\navailable on the market. Because they predicted limited demand for Elite, Apollo\ndecided to price it only slightly higher than their medium quality paper. However, Elite's\nmaterial and production costs were significantly greater than those of its medium-quality\npaper.\nDemand for Elite\nThe demand for Elite Paper turned out to be much greater than anticipated. Customers\nliked Elite's heavier feel, glossiness, whiteness. They found it to be an especially good\nvalue for the price. Although Apollo was extremely pleased with Elite's initial success,\nElite's profit margin was too low to justify its production in the long term. One way or\nanother they had to improve their margins on Elite. Instead of risking customer loss as a\nresult of raising Elite's price, Apollo chose to focus on reducing the production costs.\nProduction\nPoster paper is manufactured in a continuous process. Rolls of dry paper feed stock are\npulled through a series of machines to emerge as finished poster paper. The feedstock is\ncharacterized by its dry weight (bone dry weight in pounds per thousand square feet\n(KSF)) and caliper (thickness in mils). The paper is first treated with titanium dioxide\n(TiO2), a whitening agent, and then coated. The coating, a polyethylene resin which also\ncontains TiO2, is applied to both the wire (bottom) side and face (top) side of the paper in\npolyethylene extruder machines. The speed of the process is limited by the thickness of\nthe applied resins. (Increasing resin thickness decreases the process speed.)\n\nface side polyethylene\npaper\nwire side polyethylene\n\nPoster Paper Cross Section\n(not to scale)\n\nThe increased production costs stemmed from the increased polyethylene laydown\nrequired on Elite. The paper coating operation increased the polyethylene laydown on\nthe face side from six pounds per thousand square feet to thirteen pounds per thousand\nsquare feet and increased the wire side laydown from six pounds per thousand square feet\nto eleven pounds per thousand square feet (#/KSF). In addition to the higher material\ncosts, the large increase in polyethylene laydown caused serious processing problems. It\nwas causing machine rolls to fail and was forcing Apollo to reduce the machine speeds\nfrom 700 feet per minute to 400 feet per minute (fpm). This posed a serious problem as\nthe facility was loaded to 95% capacity. The purchase of further capacity would be\nextremely costly. Speeds of less than 600 fpm would be unprofitable. The production\nengineers hoped to increased the speed to the maximum of 1000 fpm.\nOver the past two years the Apollo process engineers, after conducting rigorous\nstatistically designed experiments, had compiled detailed sets of equations describing\nvarious facets of the paper product (see Exhibit 1).\nIn December 1994, a joint meeting between marketing and production was held in an\nattempt to find a way to alter the process so that the product could be profitable at the\ncurrent price.\nMarketing brought information about customer expectations. This information had been\ngathered from focus groups, surveys and general market research. The feature of Elite\npaper that customers most liked was its stiffness. The process parameter that affected\nstiffness was termed sensitized stiffness. It needed to be in the range of 315 - 350.\nMarketing also found that customers could not determine a difference in gloss levels\nranging from 40.5 to 63 and that ATT, a measure of overall attractiveness, could range\nbetween 93.75 and 94.00.\nThe production people believed that a reduction in face side resin coverage from\n13#/KSF to 9#/KSF would allow the machines to run at 600 feet per minute (fpm). Resin\ncoverage of less than 6#/KSF would be inadequate. Feedstock was available in weights\nranging from 30 - 40#/KSF and at calipers between 6.00 - 7.30 mils. The resulting\ndensity needed to fall in the range of 0.98 - 1.10. The amount of TiO2 in the paper\ntraditionally ranged between 0 - 5% and in the resin between 8 - 12.5%. To achieve the\ndesired sensitized stiffness values it was believed that an intermediate process variable\n(termed B-319 stiffness) needed to be in the range of 120 - 250 and the sensitized caliper\n(a measure of caliper adjusted to account for the wire and face side coatings) between 8 -\n13 mils.\n\nCurl, which was determined by the difference in face side and wire side coatings had to\nbe between 0 and 1 to satisfy both production and customer requirements\n\nEXHIBIT 1\n\nVariables\n\nUnits\n\nDry Weight\n\n#/KSF\nCaliper\n\nmils\nSensitized Caliper\n\nmils\nWire Side (resin coverage)\n\n#/KSF\nFace Side (resin coverage)\n\n#/KSF\nTiO2 Paper\n\npercentage points\nTiO2 Resin\n\npercentage points\nProcess Speed\n\nfpm\nCost\n\n$/KSF\n\nAll other variables are dimension-less.\n\nProcess equations:\n\nDensity\n0.1922 * (Dry Weight/Caliper)\nSensitized Caliper\n0.176 * (Wire Side + Face Side) + Caliper + 0.44\nATT Color\n-0.774 + (0.165*TiO2 Paper) + (0.026*TiO2 Resin)\nATT Physical\n-0.8527 + (-2.6*Density) + (0.104* Dry Weight)\nB-319 Stiffness\n-404.7 + (67.1* Caliper) + (139.4* Density)\nSensitized Stiffness\n-188 + (0.865*B-319 Stiffness) + (30* Sensitized Caliper)\nProcess Speed\n1050 - (50* Face Side)\nCurl\nWire Side - Face Side\nGloss\n-9.958 + (5.625* Face Side)\nATT total\n93.567 + (0.5* ATT Physical) + ATT Color\n\nCOST:\n\n(0.363*Wire Side) + (0.752*Face Side) + (0.41581*Dry Weight) +\n(1.09)*(TiO2 Paper/100)*(Dry Weight) + (0.3597)*(Face Side)*(TiO2 Resin/100)\n\nAfter reading the case you should examine the spreadsheet. The top of the spreadsheet has the\ninitial conditions. In the bottom half of the spreadsheet we have set up an optimization model,\nbased on the information is the case. You should open up Solver and review how the model has\nbeen set up.\n\nQuestions\n\nWhen the Elite product was introduced, the choice for feedstock had a dry weight\nof 36.1 #/KSF with a caliper of 6.7 mils, and 4.1 % TiO2. The polyethylene resin had\n12.5% TiO2, and was coated on the face side at 13 #/KSF and on the wire side at 11\n#/KSF.1\n\nIn light of the success of Elite, how might Apollo \"re engineer\" the product and\nprocess to improve its product margins? What savings are possible? What changes\nwould need to be made? What impact might this have on product features?\n\nWhat further improvements are possible if Apollo relaxed some of the marketing\nrequirements for Elite paper?\n\n1 The specified design requirements were not completely satisfied by this product formulation, which was\nof concern. In addition to reducing costs, Apollo hoped to bring the product design back into specification."

      "content": "MIT Leaders for Manufacturing Program\nFord Pan-European Durable Containers1\nIntroduction\nEurope is Ford Motor Company's second largest market in both vehicle production and\nrevenues. In the last decade, the European governments have been very progressive in\nimplementing environmentally friendly legislation. The European laws include costly disposal\nfees for expendable (cardboard) containers. In 1995, Ford furthered their Greening Strategy by\nreplacing a significant number of expendable containers with the introduction of reusable durable\nplastic Folding Large Containers (FLC). A third party supplier, Durable Container Provider,\nleased and managed the process for the assembly plants and component suppliers. The empty\nFLCs are shipped from the assembly plant to the suppliers, where they are filled with automotive\ncomponents, then shipped back to the assembly plants to complete one full cycle. In 1999, Ford\nintroduced a smaller container, called the Folding Small Container (FSC). In 2001, the FLC and\nFSC pool size is approximately 210,000 and 20,000, respectively. The FLC/FSC Greening\nStrategy is a cost savings for Ford in the amount of millions of dollars annually.\nOccasionally, the automotive component suppliers utilize expendable containers when\ndurable containers are not immediately available. Automotive components cannot be delayed to\nthe assembly plants due to the enormous costs of assembly plant production stoppages, which are\napproximately $15,000 per minute for Ford European assembly plants.2 In addition, the\nEuropean plants discourage expendable packaging because of higher total cost to the plant.\n1 Copyright (c) 2002 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The FLC has a height of 0.975 meter\nand a weight of 63 kilograms, while the FSC has a height of 0.6 meter and a weight of 40\nkilograms. Both the FLC and FSC have the same load capacity of 500 kilograms. The most\nefficient trailer volume utilization occurs with the FLC in the popular Megatrailer (also known as\nSupercube) that has a width of 2.45 meters, a length of 13.6 meters, and a height of 2.95 meters\n(the Megatrailer allows for 78 erect FLCs). The FLC/FSC has other advantages over cardboard,\nlike its container wall strength and stackability. Utilizing the Megatrailer, the FLC can be\nstacked three high without the threat of collapsing under the weight of their contents. When\nautomotive components are shipped in cardboard containers of equal size to the FLC, most often\nthe cardboard containers can only be stacked two high resulting in one third less trailer shipping\nutilization. In addition, the FLC and FSC are foldable to a height of 0.4 meter to reduce empty\ncontainer freight. The Megatrailer allows for 7 empties high, which equates to a full truckload of\n182 empty FLC/FSCs. Since, FLC and FSC are similar in size and shipping capabilities, they\nare often substitutes for one another.\n- 2\n\nDurable containers are also advantageous for ergonomic issues. The FLC/FSCs are often\nfound on the manufacturing shop floor tilted towards the assemblers, who may be subject to\nergonomic back issues from excessive leaning. Durable containers made of plastic or steel have\nthe container wall strength necessary to tilt heavy automotive components towards the\nassembler, as opposed to cardboard containers that may collapse. The fixed tilters will incline\nthe FLC/FSCs approximately 30 degrees. Also, the FLC/FSCs have access doors with hinges\nand handles mounted into the sides of the containers to further address ergonomic issues.\nThe automotive components are often stacked and separated within the FLC/FSCs by\n\"dunnage\", which are made of cardboard or plastic. The cardboard dunnage is recyclable. The\nplastic dunnage is usually collapsible and reusable, thus shipped back to the component\nsuppliers. In 2001, approximately 10% of the FLC/FSCs utilized no dunnage and 90% did\nutilize dunnage - 88% of the dunnage was cardboard and 12% was plastic.\nProcess Overview\nThroughout Europe, FLCs and FSCs (FXCs) are filled with automotive components by\n270 suppliers and shipped to 7 Ford assembly plants. The containers are transported to and from\nthe assembly plants by Ford transportation and their transportation supplier, Lead Logistics\nPartner. Many haulers transport containers filled with vehicle components from suppliers to\nassembly plants and transport empty containers and pallets back to the suppliers. At the\nassembly plant, the component carrying containers are distributed to the production line side for\nvehicle assembly. The empty containers are collected and sorted at the Empty Pallet\nCompounds, which are located on or near the Ford plant shipping docks. The Empty Pallet\nCompounds will store most of the empty container safety stocks, while other safety stocks are\nstored in nearby warehouses.\nOne main driver for a standard universal container is based on the empty pallet strategy,\nwhere you have a large pool with many different uses for many different industries and all\nstakeholders benefit from the standardization. When a container or pallet is empty, it is most\ncost effective to transport it the shortest distance for reuse by anyone. For example, an empty\ncontainer or pallet traveling on a truck has little to no value. Usually, there is no need to ship\nstandardized empty pallets across Europe or any long distance. The benefits of a durable\ncontainer strategy with a large standardized container pool and empty container management\n- 3\n\nresulted in the decision that a third party supplier (Durable Container Provider) should own,\nmanage, and lease the FXCs to Ford and their component suppliers.\nFord assembly plants communicate with their component suppliers through an electronic\nlink called the Common Manufacturing Management System (CMMS-3). The suppliers are\naware of the projected build approximately a month in advance. The final component orders are\nconfirmed one or two weeks prior to actual production via the Advance Shipping Notice (ASN).\nThe suppliers will ship components in a variety of packaging including the FXC. As suppliers\nuse FXCs, they will order empties from the Durable Container Provider. Communication is\nhandled over the internet with the fax and telephone as backup communication links. The\nDurable Container Provider not only manages and tracks the containers; they also request empty\ncontainer movements from the transportation group (Ford Transportation and Lead Logistics\nPartner). The component suppliers are advised to allow five days for processing plus the\nrespective delivery time.\nB\nA\nC\nD\nE\nG\nF\nA - Genk, Belgium\nB - Cologne, Germany\nC - Saarlouis, Germany\nD - Dagenham, England\nE - Halewood, England\nF - Southampton, England\nG - Valencia, Spain\n- 4\n\nDuring the twelve months of June 2000 through May 2001, Ford of Europe produced 1.5\nmillion vehicles. The models included Escort, Fiesta, Focus, Ka, Mondeo, and Transit. The\nproduction regions are grouped into three regions: German (Genk, Belgium; Cologne, Germany;\nand Saarlouis, Germany), British (Dagenham, England; Halewood, England; and Southampton,\nEngland), and Spanish (Valencia, Spain). The total FXC container movements over the same\nperiod were approximately 2.7 million. The number of annual container movements (2.7\nmillion) divided by the container pool size (230,000) yields yearly turns of 11.7. This equates to\n31.2 calendar days for cycle time - the amount of time a container takes to travel completely\nthrough the process. The European FXC process includes 270 component suppliers, located in\n14 countries: Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Czech Republic, France, Hungary,\nItaly, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. The component\nsuppliers are grouped into four regions: Germany (Belgium and Germany), the United Kingdom,\nSpain, and the 4th region representing the ten countries of Czech Republic, France, Hungary,\nItaly, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. Container\nmovements to and from German component suppliers represent 25% of the total movements.\nContainer movements to and from the United Kingdom and Spanish component suppliers\nrepresent 24% and 21%, respectively. All other suppliers (using the FXC) located outside\nGermany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Spain represents 30% of the container movements.\nVehicle production by the three assembly regions is as follows: Germany - 64%, Britain - 14%,\nand Spain - 22%. FXC movements based on assembly plant usage are as follows: German -\n68%, British - 10%, and Spanish - 22%. The container pool requires FXCs to be shipped from\nregion to region. The only region to be nearly balanced is the Spanish region where the Spanish\ncomponent suppliers require 558,568 FXCs per year while the Valencia Assembly Plant requires\n587,403 FXCs per year. The German suppliers require 677,403 FXCs while the three German\nassembly plants require 1,846,092 FXCs; therefore the German Empty Pallet Compounds,\nlocated within the three German assembly plants, have an excess of 1,168,689 empty FXCs that\nare shipped to component suppliers in non-German regions. The United Kingdom suppliers\nrequire 657,961 FXCs while the British assembly plants require only 266,505 FXCs; therefore\nthe British assembly plants cannot support the United Kingdom component suppliers'\nrequirements. The shortfall (imbalance of -391,456) results in the non-British Empty Pallet\nCompounds to ship 391,456 FXCs to Britain. The closest non-British Empty Pallet Compound\n- 5\n\nto Britain is Genk, Belgium, which is part of the German assembly region. The Genk, Belgium\nplant is also the least expensive transportation route from the European continent assembly\nplants to Britain. The container imbalance requires attention to assure the component suppliers\nare properly supplied from the Empty Pallet Compounds. The region to region shipping not only\nrequires more transportation resources (drivers, trailers, and diesel/gasoline) for the extra\nkilometers, but the region to region shipping requires more containers for the enlarged container\npool to cover the extra shipping days during transportation.\nProcess Costing\nFord instructs the Durable Container Provider to maintain FXCs at the component\nsuppliers in the amount equal to five days worth of production, while Ford pays the daily lease\nfees. Since the component suppliers use \"free\" FXCs instead of purchasing cardboard\nthemselves, Ford receives the automotive components at a lower price. A cardboard box of\nequal size to the FXC with reinforced walls costs €23.\nThe cost of a new FXC is approximately €200. Assuming a five-year life cycle and 218\nworking days, the generic daily lease cost is €0.183. The annual Empty Pallet Compound real\nestate cost is €280 per square meter. The FXC has a base of 1.2 square meters and empties are\nusually stacked 14 high; therefore, the daily Empty Pallet Compound real estate daily cost is\n€0.110 per FXC.\nA failure in the FXC process occurs when a FXC is not immediately available for the\ncomponent supplier. If components arrive in any container besides the originally specified\ncontainer, the non-specified container will cause some disruption in the assembly process. For\nexample, the line side process expects a predetermined number of components per container.\nMaterial handling replenish intervals are based on components per container for the vehicle mix.\nWhen an expendable container is used instead of a FXC, the plant will incur extra handling and\ndisposal costs. The cost impact for a FXC process failure is approximately €45 per occurrence,\nwhich includes the cardboard box, disposable fee, extra handling, and inbound freight impact.\n- 6\n\nBenchmarking\nSupermarket Industry\nThe supermarket industry uses many plastic durable containers for a variety of\nproducts like frozen foods, vegetables, and fresh fish. The supermarket chains and their\nsuppliers utilize the containers, while a third party durable container provider will\nmanage the containers similar to the automotive industry. The relatively short shelf life\nof product poses some real challenges. The durable container providers in this industry\nusually charge the stakeholders relativity expensive daily lease (hire) fees to discourage\nthe stakeholders from retaining containers, instead encouraging the stakeholders to\nturnover containers. The strategy of \"hot potato\" with the containers is necessary to\nreinforce the desired behavior of getting the product and container to market quickly.\nThe supermarket industry requires intense cleaning of the containers after every use.\nSimilar to the automotive industry, excessive handling of product results in damaged\nproduct, for example bruised tomatoes. The supermarket industry, like the automotive\nindustry, will put containers and product directly on the shelf (line side) without re\nhandling. Unlike the automotive industry, the supermarket's end-user (customer) feels\nand smells the product along with the container that carried it to market. If tomatoes\nsmell like fish from a poorly cleaned container, the supermarket custome r would not\npurchase the tomatoes. From tomatoes to fish, the cleanliness of the product and\ncontainer is very important to the supermarket industry. In addition, the container's color,\nsize, and shape are all integral aspects of product marketing. The profit mark up on\ngroceries is small, usually a few percentage points. With very little room for\ninefficiencies, the supermarket industry relies heavily on inexpensive internet\ntechnologies to track containers. The small profit constraints and short shelf life product\nmake the supermarket industry a worthwhile benchmarking exercise.\nMilk Industry\nThe American and British milk industries have done excellent jobs of\nimplementing standardized milk packaging and containers (milk crates). The American\nmilk producers have overcome a huge problem of milk crate leakage (loss/stolen). For\nmany decades, the most popular bookshelf and furniture for American college students\n- 7\n\nwas plastic milk crates. American college students are not the only ones who have\nillegally used milk crates; milk crates have been found in many family garages. In the\nlate eighties, American legislation placed $300 fines for stolen and unauthorized use of\nmilk crates. The warnings were placed on every milk crate. Unfortunately, the warning\nand dormitory raids were not enough to overcome the market forces for the college\nbookshelf and furniture or the family garage storage bin. The need to pilfer milk crates\nby Americans was finally overcome with the help of department stores, who legally sell\ngeneric crates to the American public. The British addressed the leakage issue by\nstandardizing a container that has plastic dividers injection molded into the design. The\ndividers not only protect the bottles from touching one another, but also render the milk\ncrate virtually useless for anything other than transporting milk bottles.\nWith the leakage issued properly addressed, the American and British milk\nindustries capture the greatest benefits of pooling a standard interchangeable milk crate.\nAfter milk cartoons and bottles are removed from the milk crate, the milk crate is mixed\nwith other milk crates and no effort is necessary to sort the crate back to any particular\nmilk producer. Most milk crates are treated as generic milk crates. A milk producer may\nor may not receive his crates back from the supply chain. The milk producers are\nsatisfied with the one-for-one exchange and container deposit method where the\ncontainers are mixed, because they all are of equal value and usefulness. The milk crate\nis an excellent example of a standardized container pool.\nAutomotive Industry\nOf the four industries benchmarked, the automotive industry has the most\nexpensive containers carrying the most expensive products. Also, the automotive\nindustry spends a significant amount of money to track the containers from location to\nlocation. These costs are becoming more affordable with the application of inexpensive\ninternet technology.\nBesides the FLC and FSC, Ford of Europe utilizes a variety of containers,\nincluding the smaller plastic container Klein Ladungs Traeger (KLT). Based on the\nnumber of parts, the container percentage breakdown utilized by Ford of Europe are:\nFLC/FSC - 25%, KLT - 55%, cardboard - 2%, and all other containers - 18%. Some\n- 8\n\nautomotive components travel across continents or even across oceans; for these travel\nroutes, cardboard is a viable and cost effective container. Other containers include\nengine racks and specialized containers like stretched FLC bumper racks. Ford of Europe\nutilizes four KLT sizes that range from 0.009 to 0.067 cubic meters (0.3 to 2.4 cubic\nfeet). The European KLT container pool is used most by Ford and General Motors,\nwhich represent usages of 30% and 60%, respectively. The remaining 10% are non-\nautomotive applications. The automotive industry would prefer empty containers to\ntravel the shortest distance back to component suppliers; hence, a large standardized pool\nwith many uses is critical.\nThe automotive industry, like other industries, has leakage issues. One\ninexpensive method to address the pilfer issue is to sell containers within the assembly\nplants and component supplier locations. Ford Motor Company in Europe has three main\nplastic container colors: blue, black, and green. Since white containers are not used for\nautomotive components, Ford Motor Company sells white containers at their general\nstores for non-production uses within the plants. The color distinction allows Ford to\npolice their plants quickly for improper use of durable containers.\nRemoving Constraints and Encouraging the Right Behavior\nFord has also looked at other strategies to promote efficiencies and Best-In-Class in their\nsupply chain. Automotive components are of higher quality and less expense, if they are handled\nthe fewest number of times within the supply chain. Ford encourages the component suppliers to\nintegrate the FLC and FSC as part of their Work-In-Process to help reduce their costs, since\ncomponent suppliers' costs are an integral part of the larger Ford supply chain. Some suppliers\nmay find it economically feasible to hold onto containers for time periods longer than five days.\nUnfortunately, the longer period of time that a component supplier holds onto a container, the\nless often the container is utilized (turnover) within the supply chain. The lower turnover\ndemands a larger number of containers for the supply chain pool. Ultimately, Ford pays the\nleasing costs as a function of container pool size. The misaligned incentives have caused Ford\nand their component suppliers difficulties in the past. One train of thought was to dictate and\nconstrain the component suppliers to the number of containers and to the length of time that they\nmay retain containers. Dictating and constraining any process ultimately results in deadweight\n- 9\n\nloss. The Ford core team reviewed this policy to determine a mutually beneficial scenario for all\nstakeholders, including the 270 component suppliers. The resulting policy was that the\ncomponent suppliers would receive containers equal to five days worth of production at no cost\nto the component suppliers, while Ford pays the daily lease fees. If the component suppliers\nneed containers greater than five days worth of production, then the suppliers must pay a small\ndaily fee per container. Similar to the supermarket industry, the fees encourage the component\nsuppliers to turnover the container assets. However, if the suppliers receive value from the\ncontainers being a part of their Work-In-Progress, then let the suppliers pay for the containers at\na fair market price. The revenues generated from the supplier fees could be used by Ford to\noffset container lease costs or purchase more containers to increase the pool size. Thus, if\nsuppliers hold onto containers resulting in a larger pool size, the supplier fees would self-fund\nthe container pool size. Recognizing the fact that suppliers may need containers for longer\nperiods of time and charging them appropriately allows Ford and their component suppliers to\ncooperate in harmony with the financial and process market forces.\nThe core team also envisioned a futuristic incentive strategy for the FXC process. The\nfive \"free\" days worth of production containers that component suppliers receive is potentially\nconstraining and wasteful. The \"free\" days means no cost to the component suppliers, while the\nFord assembly plants pay the actual leasing fees for their component suppliers. The number of\nfive days was determined years ago as an across the board buffer, since the component suppliers\nare located in many countries. A shared cost savings opportunity could exist for those\ncomponent suppliers that can operate with less than five days worth of containers. The smaller\namount of containers that a component supplier requires results in a smaller container pool,\nwhich reduces Ford's container leasing costs. Ford and their suppliers could remove a constraint\nand deadweight loss from the supply chain in synergy with their yearly objectives. More\nimportantly, the organizational process solution permits Ford and their component suppliers a\nmutually beneficial cost saving opportunity that rewards participation.\nLogistics Modeling\nAs previously mentioned, the FLC and FSC are similar in size and shipping capacity and\noften are substitutes for one another. If a component supplier does not have FLCs available but\ndoes have FSCs available, the FSCs would be used as temporary replacements, and vice versa.\n- 10\n\nIf a component supplier had neither FLCs nor FSCs, the components would be supplied in\ncardboard and Ford would incur expenses of €45 per occurrence. The container substitution is\nproblematic for Ford, but much less troublesome than dealing with cardboard boxes. In order to\nsimplify the analysis, the FLC and FSC data is combined in Tables 2, 3, and 4.\nMost third party container leasing contracts are based on a daily lease rate. The more\ncontainers in the pool, the more the Durable Container Provider could possibly earn in revenues.\nA FXC safety stock is needed to cover for variances especially during model launches, which\nhave exceptionally high container variances. Too many FXCs would result in excessive daily\nlease and real estate costs. In addition, the regional container imbalance must be effectively\nmanaged. For example, the Valencia Assembly Plant had on an annual basis 28,835 extra FXCs,\nof which some were being shipped to the UK to offset their imbalance. Unfortunately, the travel\ntime from Valencia to the UK is approximately 5 days. Fewer containers in transit would result\nin a smaller container pool. The preferable route for the UK imbalance would be from Genk,\nsince this transit time is only 1.5 days. The extra Valencia containers could be shipped to\nGerman suppliers, who could in turn back feed the three German assembly plants, includ ing\nGenk. What Ford needed was a holistic shipping template for the FXC process that addressed\nthe container imbalance and delivered optimal quality, cost, and time.\n- 11\n\nTable 1 below contains the shipping times in days from the assembly plants to the component\nsuppliers grouped by country.\nTable 1: Transit Times In Days\nSuppliers\nASSEMBLY PLANTS\nDAGENHAM\nGENK\nHALEWOOD\nKOELN\nSAARLOUIS\nSO'TON\nVALENCIA\nCzech Republic\nFrance\nHungary\nItaly\n5.5\nNetherlands\n5.5\nPoland\nPortugal\nSlovakia\nSweden\n5.5\nSwitzerland\nBelgium\nGermany\n5.5\n5.5\nUnited Kingdom\n1.5\n1.5\n0.8\nSpain\n5.5\n5.5\nThe component suppliers will fill FXCs as per the demand from the assembly plants.

      "content": "Human Genome Project1\nBy Jeremie Gallien2 and Scott A. Rosenberg3\nScott was now a couple of weeks into his MIT Leaders for Manufacturing\nprogram internship at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge. The exciting premise for\nhis project was that the genome finishing group at work there could benefit from a\nsound flow analysis of the type usually applied in manufacturing environments. While\nhe had received great support from his supervisors all along and felt that he had already\nacquired a reasonably good handle of the work in his area of scope, he also knew that he\nstill had to prove his worth: in an environment with scores of PhDs, many world-\nrenown scientists and even Nobel prize winners walking through now and then,\nnobody was going to settle for small talk and unsupported recommendations.\nIndeed, the sequence finishing operation seemed considerably more repetitive\nand process-oriented than anything else at the Whitehead, an institution known for\nbreaking new grounds in Biology through scientific experiments never attempted\nbefore. Because of the need to accurately forecast the final completion date of the\ngenome and to plan for staffing levels, the largest complaint of the scientists overseeing\nthe finishing group was by far the variability of weekly output. Scott suspected that the\npractice of bundling many tasks into a single project assigned to each finisher and the\ninformal, on-demand policy followed when assigning new projects played no small role\nin this variability. What he did not know yet however was how to quantify these effects\nso he could convince the Whitehead managers to change their procedures.\nThe Human Genome Project\nArguably the most important undertaking in life sciences since the discovery of\nDNA in 1953, the Human Genome Project (HGP) began in 1990. Its simple but\nambitious goal is to sequence the entire genetic makeup of the human species, which\nwill enable decades of evolutionary and medical research on cross-genomic comparison,\ndisease risk detection, gene therapy and possibly uncountable other applications not\neven imagined yet by scientists. Primary responsibility for the sequencing fell to large\ngenome centers like the Whitehead Institute at MIT, Washington University, Baylor\nUniversity, and the Sanger Center in Great Britain, with dozens of smaller centers\naround the world also contributing.\n1 This version: July 2003.\n2 Corresponding author: MIT Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, MA 02142\n3 Most material in this case originates from Scott Rosenberg's Leaders for Manufacturing Master's\nthesis, \"Managing a Data Analysis Production Line: An Example from the Whitehead/MIT\nCenter for Genomic Research,\" Sloan School of Management and Dept. of EECS, Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology, June 2003.\nCopyright 2003 (c) Jeremie Gallien and Scott Rosenberg\n\nIn 2000, a draft sequence of the human genome was published. However, it\ncontained many absent, ambiguous, or conflicting regions of DNA. In the time since the\ndraft's publication, genome centers like the Whitehead have concentrated their energies\non systematically clarifying these problematic regions. This process is called finishing,\nand is both the current bottleneck of the genome project and the focus of Scott's work.\nDNA Sequencing Background\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the genetic building block upon which all\nknown life regulates its daily function and long-term evolution. Constituting the\nchromosomes found in the nucleus of human cells, DNA is itself comprised of long\nstrings of just four nucleotide bases called adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and\nthymine (T). Active sequences of DNA that are hundreds or thousands of base pairs\nlong, called genes, are translated into proteins during the course of cell activity. Proteins,\nin turn, enable all of life's most basic functions.\nStructurally speaking, DNA is a stable polymer that arranges itself into a double\nhelical structure as shown in Figure 1. Long sequences of nucleotide bases form one\nhalf of the structure. Each base also bonds to its complementary base in the other half of\nthe structure: A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Thus, a sequence of \"ATTGC\" bonds to\nits complementary sequence \"TAACG\". All told, the human genome consists of more\nthan three billion DNA base pairs and an estimated 30,000 genes.\nFigure 1. Relationship between cells, chromosomes, DNA, and proteins.4\nToday's state-of-the-art gene sequencing technology proceeds by breaking large\nDNA samples into small segments, determining the exact DNA sequence of those small\nsegments, then reconstructing sequence from these segments into a composite view of\n4 Source: U.S. Department of Energy,\nhttp://www.ornl.gov/TechResources/Human_Genome/publicat/primer2001/1.html.\nCopyright 2003 (c) Jeremie Gallien and Scott Rosenberg\n\nthe original sample: DNA donated by a small set of consenting, anonymous individuals\nis first purified, then enzymes are used to break it down into smaller segments; From\nthe mix that results, segments with a length of approximately 165,000 base pairs\n(165kbp), called BAC templates, are isolated. An engineered version of the bacteria E. coli\ncan then be tricked into carrying and reproducing this human genetic material millions\nof times in just hours. To accomplish a further reduction in sample size necessary to\ndirect sequencing, BACs are then sheared through a physical process and filtered,\nproducing DNA segments of uniform size, usually between 4kbp and 10kbp. Once\nisolated, each such segment becomes known as a plasmid (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Two phase break-down of genome into BACs and then plasmids.\nGenome,\n~ 3 bbp\nBAC templates,\n~ 165 kbp\nPlasmids,\n~ 4 kbp\nnot drawn to scale\nAfter amplification through E. coli, plasmids are placed in a solution containing\nspecial DNA base pairs that are tagged with a fluorescent dye. By raising the\ntemperature of the solution, the plasmid DNA, which normally resides in a paired\nhelical structure, can be induced to separate. When the temperature is lowered, an\nenzyme in the solution reconstructs the helical structure by grabbing base pairs from the\nsurrounding solution. Whenever the enzyme selects a dyed base pair, however, the\nreconstruction process stops, leaving a DNA segment that is prematurely terminated by\na dyed A, T, G, or C. By cycling the heat many times, technicians can produce a solution\ncontaining a wide array of dye-terminated segments of various sizes (see Figure 3).\nFigure 3.

The solution of dyed plasmid segments is placed at one\nend of a long capillary. A charge causes the DNA to migrate through this capillary, with\nsmaller segments racing ahead of larger segments because of their lighter molecular\nweight. At the end of the capillary, where the segments gradually emerge, a laser\nilluminates the dyed base pairs at the end of the DNA molecules. A sensor detects the\ncontinuously varying illumination and records it in a data file. A piece of software then\nanalyzes this data and makes a base-pair determination (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Example output from detection process.\nWhat remains of the gene sequencing process is strictly information processing.\nA software tool called an assembler attempts to match plasmids from a BAC by\nsimilarities in their sequence. If everything works correctly, the assembler will\nreconstruct a single view of a BAC's underlying sequence (see Figure 5).\nFigure 5. Example assembly with eight reads and consensus.\nsequence data\nfrom eight\nplasmids\nconsensus\nsequence as\ndetermined by\nassembler\nUnfortunately, in many cases the assembler fails to construct a complete\nrendition of the BAC, leaving regions known as gaps where the DNA sequence data is of\npoor quality or missing. This is where the finishing group intervenes.\nThe Finishing Group\nClosing gaps is the primary function of the finishing group of the Whitehead\nInstitute, employing at times as many as forty human analysts. In some cases, finishers\ncan close a gap by editing the data already present in the BAC assembly using various\nspecialized software. In other cases, finishers must select and order laboratory\nprocedures, then analyze them in order to discover missing sequence information. In\nclassic manufacturing terms, finishing represents the inspection, quality assurance, and\nrework phases of the gene sequencing process.\nCopyright 2003 (c) Jeremie Gallien and Scott Rosenberg\n\nThere are many possible reasons why gaps form; in addition to operator errors\nexamples include toxicity of plasmid DNA to E. coli and DNA resistance to certain\nchemicals used. Very few of these reasons are fully understood however, as it is often\nextremely difficult or economically infeasible to determine how a particular gap arose.\nGenerally speaking, finishers triage two types of gaps. A captured gap is spanned by\ngenetic material from a single plasmid. The finisher may be able to perform a lab\nprocedure on the plasmid in order to discover the missing sequence. An uncaptured gap,\non the other hand, occurs between the sequences of two or more plasmids. Thus, the\nassembler has no basis for joining the sequence on either side of the gap. The finisher\nmust then use other, more complicated techniques to discover the missing DNA\nsequence. For a variety of reasons, uncaptured gaps usually prove more difficult than\ncaptured gaps.\nFinishers often find themselves in a catch-22: to select an appropriate laboratory\nprocedure, they must understand the underlying sequence, but the sequence is missing.\nIn practice, they must make educated guesses about the underlying sequence and the\nlikelihood that various laboratory techniques will succeed. Their decision is influenced\nby the condition of the DNA near the gap; it is also influenced by the ability of their\ninformatics tools to highlight those conditions. Most importantly, finishers' decisions\nare guided by their skill and experience: whereas some experienced finishers may be\nable to close a gap based on the information already present in an assembly, less\nexperienced finishers may feel they need laboratory work. In any case, finishers are\noften unable to close a gap after a single round of additional laboratory tests (a work\ncycle) and must try again until they succeed in closing the gap. Each attempt generates\ninformation that offers new insights into how the finisher should proceed. For example,\nthe gap may have been partially closed, indicating that the previous procedure worked,\nalbeit incrementally. Alternatively, a failure may indicate that the underlying DNA is\nresistant to the chosen procedure. In still other cases, the procedures may fail uniformly,\nraising the possibility that the lab committed an error. With the information they gain at\neach attempt, finishers proceed in a trial-and-error, iterative fashion until they succeed\nin closing the gap (see Figure 6 for a process flow diagram, and Exhibit 1 for data on gap\nclosure probability and finisher processing times).\nFigure 6. Process flow diagram for a finisher's work.\nFinisher\ning\ning\nl\ni\nNew Projects\nLab\nProcess\nCompleted\nProjects\nProcess\nComp eted\nLabwork\nSubmtted\nLabwork\nCopyright 2003 (c) Jeremie Gallien and Scott Rosenberg\n\nThere are both delay and cost implications to the iterative nature of this\nworkflow: projects submitted to the lab are only returned after an average of 70 hours,\nwith a standard deviation of 10 hours (while the lab is shared across all finishers, it may\nbe assumed for the purpose of analysis that the lab has infinite capacity). In addition,\neach lab iteration is estimated to cost about $200.\nIn part to promote a sense of work ownership, Whitehead has historically\nconverted each BAC assembly into a finishing project and then assigned it to a single\nfinisher until project completion. BACs however contain a variable number of gaps, so\nthe volume of finishing work associated with each project assignment may vary\nsignificantly (see Exhibit 2 for data on the number of gaps per BAC assembly project).\nWhen a finisher starts working on a project (either a new project or from the completed\nlabwork queue), he/she first works on all its gaps, then (if appropriate) sends it to the\nlab as a whole for further tests on all the gaps still unresolved at that point. A project is\ncompleted only when all its gaps are closed.\nThe assignment of new projects to finishers is done fairly informally. For the\nmost part, managers have been following an \"on-demand\" work release policy whereby\nfinishers independently request new projects to be assigned to them. In the current\nphase of the HGP, requests are automatically granted as the number of new projects\navailable seems virtually infinite. For most finishers, the primary consideration driving\na new project request is the immediate concern of running out of work. Many also\nacknowledge the objective to constitute a portfolio of both hard and easy projects as part\nof their work-in-in progress, so they can more easily meet the short-term production\ngoals sometimes set by managers. In fact, a common pattern is for finishers to request\n(and obtain) a new project whenever their queue of completed lab work projects falls\nbelow a \"watermark\" level of 4 to 5 projects. Finishers usually give priority to new\nprojects over existing ones that came back from the lab.\nCopyright 2003 (c) Jeremie Gallien and Scott Rosenberg\n\nExhibit 1: Finisher Performance\nGap Closure Probability\nFigure 1 below shows the observed probability of gap closure by work cycle for\nWhitehead's finishers in 2002. The conditional probability lines represent the chances that\na gap is closed in its Nth work cycle given that it was not closed in the preceding N-1\ncycles. The cumulative probability lines represent the chances that a gap is closed by the\nend of the Nth work cycle.\nFigure 1.

For the purpose of analysis however it may be\nassumed that an average finisher spends exactly 1h per captured gap per cycle, and\n1h30 per uncaptured gap per cycle. Also, analysts may be assumed to effectively work\n35h per week on closing gaps.\nSummary of Finisher Model Data\nThe data that may be used for modeling purposes as described in this exhibit is\nsummarized in Table 1:\nTable 1.

Figure 1 shows the observed frequency of projects\naccording to their gap count in Whitehead's portion of the human genome. Balloon size\nindicates the relative frequency of a project with [x,y] captured and uncaptured gaps.\nProjects with zero gaps ([0,0]) are excluded from the distribution because they generally\nrequire little finishing work.\nFigure 1. Observed gap distribution.\n-1\n-1\n\nNumber of Uncaptured Gaps\nNumber of Captured Gaps\nThe mean rate of gap occurrence in Whitehead's projects is 2.1 captured gaps per\nproject and 0.5 uncaptured gaps per project. While the actual data exhibits a slight\ncorrelation, for the purpose of analysis it may be assumed that captured and uncaptured\ngaps occur independently. Secondly, it may be assumed that the number of gaps in a\nproject occur according to a Poisson process with the same observed means as the\nempirical data (i.e. 2.1 captured gaps per project and 0.5 uncaptured gaps per project).\nSo if C and U denote the number of captured and uncaptured gaps per project,\nrespectively, we have:\nx\ny\nα\nC\nP\n= U\nx\n= y ) =\ne -α β e -β ,( y\nx ) ∈\n,...}\n,1,0\n{\n,\n(\n,\nx !\ny !\n,\nwith α = 2.1 and β = 0.5.

Idealized gap distribution.\n-1\n-1\nNumber of Captured Gaps\nNumber of Uncaptured Gaps\n\nA number of discrepancies with the empirical model are easily spotted. Gap\ncounts fall off more precipitously in the theoretical model. Also, projects with one\nuncaptured gap appear more common than in the empirical data. However, in light of\nbiases in collection of the data shown in Figure 1 and the resulting analysis\nsimplification, the manager of the finishing group feels that this is an appropriate\nassumption.\n\nCase Assignment for Human Genome Project\n1. Consider a finisher just starting to work on a project with N remaining captured\ngaps and M remaining uncaptured gaps (the project may have gone through a\nnumber of cycles already):\n(i)\nWhat is the total time that the finisher will spend working on the project\nduring this cycle?\n(ii)\nWhat is the probability distribution for the number of captured and\nuncaptured gaps still remaining when the finisher is done working on the\nproject for this cycle?\nHint:\nTo model these features in Simul8, you may want to associate with each work\nitem representing a project four number-valued labels keeping track of the both the initial\nand remaining number of captured and uncaptured gaps. The labels representing the\nremaining numbers of gaps can then be updated each time the project goes through a cycle\nthrough the probability distribution determined in (ii) above (in Simul8, labels can be used\ndirectly in the parameter fields defining probability distributions). In addition, you may also\nuse a number-valued label representing the remaining finishing time requirement, and\nupdate it through the formula established in (i) whenever the number of remaining gaps\nchange. When the project goes through the work center representing the finisher, the\nappropriate service time can then be obtained through a label-based distribution associated\nwith this last label.\n2.\nBuild a simulation model with Simul8 to determine the average project completion\ntime for a single finisher working under the on-demand work release policy with a\nwatermark level of 4 projects (i.e., the finisher requests a new project whenever the\ntotal of projects in his/her Completed Labwork and New Projects queues falls below\n4). What is the average and standard deviation for the number of captured and\nuncaptured gaps in the completed projects each week?\n3. How are the results of question 3 modified when instead a just-in-time work release\npolicy is followed? (i.e. new projects are only assigned to finishers when no work is\navailable to them otherwise). How is the average level of WIP affected? Interpret\nyour results.\n4. Adapt your simulation model to compute the average and standard deviation of the\nnumber of captured and uncaptured gaps completed by one finisher in one week if\nall the projects had a single gap and the just-in time policy were followed. That is,\nnow the unit of work is no longer a BAC but instead a single gap, but the proportion\nof captured and uncaptured gaps remains exactly the same as before. Interpret your\nresults.\nCopyright 2003 (c) Jeremie Gallien and Scott Rosenberg"

INTRODUCTION\nMany U.S. companies attempt to reduce labor costs by\nshifting production to overseas locations with lower wage\nrates. This decision greatly impacts supply chain performance,\nincreasing the lead times for replenishing finished goods. One\ncounter measure is to use priority shipping via air, instead of\nnormal modes of transport (ocean, rail, truck) to reduce the lead\ntimes.\nThis paper reports on a project undertaken with Polaroid\nCorporation, the world leader in instant photography. Polaroid\nhad shifted the production of its consumer-branded cameras to\nAsia.\nTo address the increasing transportation costs\nassociated with frequent air shipments, the transportation\ngroup at Polaroid began an initiative to develop a shipping\ndecision support model. The first co-author was hired as an\nintern during the summer of 2000, and conducted subsequent\nresearch during the 2000-2001 academic year to develop and\ntest a model for Polaroid to use for tactical shipping and\nproduction decisions.\nOctober 2001. This work was supported in part by the MIT Leaders\nfor Manufacturing Program, Polaroid Corporation and the Singapore-\nMIT Alliance.\nKermit Threatte completed his S.M. at the MIT Operations Research\nCenter, and is now with Analytics Operations Engineering, Inc., Boston\nMA.\nStephen C. Graves is with the Sloan School of Management and the\nEngineering System Division at MIT, Cambridge MA 02139 US.\nThis paper focuses on the development and validation of a\ntactical\nmodel\nthat\nmakes\nproduction-scheduling\nrecommendations and specifies shipping options to reduce\ntotal supply chain cost. The paper describes Polaroid, reviews\nliterature on inventory management with two replenishment\nmodes, and develops a simple static network model that can be\nused for decision support.\nWe exercise the model by\nsimulation\nto\ndetermine\nthe\nrelationship\nbetween\ntransportation costs, inventory costs, forecast error and\nmanufacturing capacity in a typical framework where\nproduction and shipping decisions are made periodically.\nFinally the paper recommends a course of action for Polaroid\nregarding model implementation.\nII. BACKGROUND\nPolaroid is the leading instant imaging company in the world\nand is the only manufacturer of traditional instant cameras and\nfilm in the United States, with revenues in 2000 of $1.85 billion.1\nThe Company's principal products are instant film, instant and\ndigital cameras, digital peripherals and secure identification\nsystems with software and system solutions.\nThe Company's products divide into two segments,\nbusiness solutions and consumer products.\nBusiness\nsolutions include photo ID systems (primarily used by\ncorporations and government agencies), digital peripherals\n(scanners, photo quality printers, high-end digital cameras and\nspecialty digital camera), and high-end instant photo cameras\nand equipment. Consumer products include a broad line of\nhand held instant cameras, digital cameras, 35mm cameras and\na wide assortment of media such as instant and 35mm film,\nvideocassettes, and digital printing media.2\nBecause\nconsumer products account for the majority of sales,\nPolaroid's\nlargest\ncustomers\nare\nmajor\nU.S\nretailers,\nsupermarket chains and drug stores . Polaroid's business\nproducts are sold through specialty channels and also direct\nchannels within the company.\nThe Company is organized into five segments: the Americas\nRegion, the European Region, the Asia Pacific Region, Global\nOperations, and Research and Development. The regions\nfocus on sales and marketing, while global operations\n1 2000 Polaroid Corporation 10K, Income Statement\n2 Polaroid Corporation 10K\n\ncentralizes procurement, logistics and manufacturing. R&D\nprovides engineering research and development for all the\nregions, as product functionality is not necessarily region\nspecific.\nThe Americas Region covers to the Western\nHemisphere. The European Region is comprised of the United\nKingdom, Continental Europe, Russia, Africa, and the Middle\nEast. The Asia Pacific Region includes Japan, Australia and\nthe majority of the Asian continent.\nPolaroid has not been a strong financial performer in the last\n11 years, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in\nOctober 2001. Polaroid's revenue tailed off in the late 1990's as\nthe market for Polaroid's traditional consumer instant cameras\nbecame saturated. Polaroid responded by marketing new lines\nof small, trendy and relatively inexpensive cameras (Pop-shots,\nI-zone, Joycam) that would appeal to the youth market.\nPolaroid also shifted much of its focus to digital technology,\nfocusing on the sale of high technology digital cameras.\nThese two newer product categories account for nearly 25% of\nsales and have offset the decline in traditional products to\nsome extent. However, sales of these new products have many\ndisadvantages compared to Polaroid's traditional instant\ncamera lines. The higher-growth youth-focus instant cameras\ndeliver smaller margins, have shorter life cycles and higher\nincidence of obsolescence, and typically use lower margin film.\nThough they have higher margins, the digital cameras do not\ngive Polaroid the benefit of a steady stream of film revenue,\nand are also characterized by short product life cycles and high\ncosts of obsolescence.\nThis trend of poor performance and new product mix has\nforced Polaroid to reduce costs, streamline operations and find\nways to increase supply chain flexibility. Polaroid shifted\ncamera production to the Far East, and shut down U.S.\nmanufacturing operations in an attempt to increase flexibility\nand reduce costs.\nPolaroid has also tried to improve its\nfinancial performance through corporate wide inventory\nreductions.\nA. Logistics at Polaroid\nPolaroid's logistics organization is part of the Company's\nGlobal Operations segment, with primary responsibility for the\nmovement\nof\nraw\nmaterials\nand\nproduct\nbetween\nmanufacturing sites and from finished goods manufacturing to\nthe retailers. Production planning, forecasting, and inventory\nmanagement (except for specialty package inventory) are not\nresponsibilities of the logis tics organization. Logistics has\nthree primary functions, customer service, packaging and\nhandling, and transportation.\nCustomer service: The customer service arm of the group is\nresponsible for handling and processing customer orders,\nworking one-on-one with Polaroid's sales force and individual\ncustomers to ensure the timely delivery of product to the\nretailer. Large customers are assigned a dedicated service\nrepresentative that will deal with all contracts, orders and\ndeliveries nationwide. These customers typically make orders\nthrough an Electronic Data Interface (EDI) system, which is\ninstantly delivered to the service rep and company distribution\ncenters. The service representative ensures that the orders are\nrealistic and attainable (i.e. the time frame and terms of the\norder are feasible and meet contract specifications) and that\nthe distribution centers are taking appropriate action to meet\nthe order. The role of the service rep becomes more critical\nwhen there is a problem with an order. It is their responsibility\nto expedite orders that were not processed on time, and to\nhandle stock-outs with the customer.\nPackaging and handling: Polaroid has three major\ndistribution centers in the U. S., located in Oak Brook IL,\nAnaheim CA, and Norton MA, which store finished goods\ninventory for delivery to the customer.\nNorton also has a\ncentralized packaging operation.\nRetailers typically order\nPolaroid products in unique and specially design package\nplatforms. These package configurations change frequently\nfor various special offers or promotions retailers have\nthroughout the year. Hence bulk cameras are not necessarily\nfinished goods to the retailer. Rather, there is a large explosion\nof specific product codes at the retail distribution level. To\nreduce inventory, Polaroid postpones the packaging step until\na customer order is received. Typically two weeks is allotted\nfor packaging and delivery of product.\nTransportation:\nThe transportation group coordinates\ndeliveries of finished goods from t he distribution centers to the\nretailers, movement of product between distribution centers,\nand international and national transshipments of manufactured\ncomponents. Most deliveries and product movement from the\ndistribution centers are arranged through third party truckload\ncompanies, though the company does own and operate a small\nfleet of its own trucks.\nOverseas transshipments are air\nfreighted or shipped on ocean carriers by the container load.\nProducts arriving by ocean from Asia typically are shipped to\nAnaheim, transferred to railcars and then shipped to Norton.\nSea shipments from Europe are sent to Boston or New York\nand are then trucked to Norton. Air shipments from most\nplaces worldwide arrive at JFK airport in New York and are\ntrucked to the Norton distribution center.\nThere are two possible modes of ocean transport, less than\ncontainer load (LCL) shipments and container load shipments.\nLCL shipments have longer lead times than container load\nshipments , as items must go through a consolidation stage\nprior to shipment and after delivery. They also have a higher\nper unit cost due to the additional tracking and handling\nnecessary to process a LCL shipment. However, this mode can\nbe preferred if units are shipped in small volumes.\nFull\ncontainer load shipments have a fixed cost regardless of the\nweight and quantity of items shipped as long as the weight\ndoes not exceed maximum container capacity requirements.\nShipping companies usually offer two container sizes, 20ft and\n40ft. The 40-ft container is more economical on a price per\ncubic foot basis. For air shipments, units are arranged on\npalletized loads, and pricing is based on weight only.\n\nB. Manufacturing Planning\nThe manufacturing planning organization is responsible for\nshort term and long term scheduling of manufacturing and\nmanagement of raw material and finished goods (pre packaged\nproduct) inventory. Members of this organization primarily\nbase their plans on forecasts generated by the sales force in\nthe various regional segments. Once goods have been\nscheduled and produced, the planners rely on the logistics\norganization to handle the shipment, packaging and\ndistribution of finished goods.\nThe planning function differs for products that are\nmanufactured in house, from those that are manufactured by\ncontractors. There is less schedule flexibility with contract\nmanufacturers. Most contracts require a minimum order level\nto be specified at least two -three months in advance of the\nmonthly production period.\nThis requirement limits the\nplanner's ability to adjust production if actual demand is\nsignificantly different from the two or three-month forecast.\nAll camera contracts invoice Polaroid at the time of shipment,\nso Polaroid takes ownership of inventory immediately as it\nleaves the contract manufacturer's loading docks.\nPlanners review the inventory in the pipeline and\ndistribution centers, and monthly sales forecasts, and create\nbuild and shipping schedules (or generate orders for contract\nmanufacturing planners).\nMost of the consumer camera\nplanners try to maintain four weeks of inventory (based on the\nforward forecast) at the distribution center and an additional\nfour weeks of inventory in the shipping pipeline. This rule of\nthumb is followed regardless of product demand patterns, or\nforecast error.\nIII. PROBLEM\nManufacturing planners have increasingly relied on costly\nair transport to transship goods manufactured in Asia to the\nUnited States. Airfreight costs have grown to account for over\n50% of the transportation budget, while being an insignificant\nportion only three years prior. Production planners decide to\nship products by air to reduce pipeline inventory, to expedite\norders when safety stock levels are lower than the four-week\nminimum, or to meet specific new-product launch dates. Due\nto production capacity constraints, the planner might have to\nresort to a series of air shipments to keep pace with demand.\nNew products are shipped by air more frequently than existing\nproducts due to the importance of having sufficient stock on\nhand during the launch.\nThe transportation group requested the development of a\ndecision support tool that would: allow planners to decide the\nquantity of goods to be shipped by air and by sea on a weekly\nbasis; help planners to achieve and maintain desired inventory\nlevels; and provide an ability to compare the cost impacts of\ninventory, capacity and shipping decisions\nWe limited the focus of this project to considering the\nshipping decisions of a single product between Asia and the\nNorton packaging facility in the United States, as this\ntransshipment route was the source of the majority of the air\ntransport cost increases. Polaroid also wanted to keep the\ninitial project simple, to increase the probability of success, to\nmake it easier to gain insights from the decision tool, and to\nmake the eventual tool implementation as simple as possible.\nIV. LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe topic of inventory management with two replenishment\nmodes has appeared in management literature since the early\nsixties. Barankin (1961) developed a one period model with two\nlead-time options of one period and instantaneous delivery.\nDaniel (1962) extends this model to include multiple periods\nbounding the size of the emergency order. Fukuda (1964)\nextends Daniel's model to include set up costs for orders and\nto allow more flexibility in the timing of the orders over multiple\nperiods.\nWright (1968) and Rosenshine and Obee (1976)\ndevelop more complicated models that allow for arbitrary lead-\ntimes as long as the emergency option is one period less than\nthe regular mode. Whittmore and Saunders (1977) further\ngeneralize the model to allow for the lead-times of the\nemergency and normal orders to differ by more than one\nperiod, but with no fixed ordering cost.\nThese papers utilize dynamic programming, which is\ntractable for finite horizon problems when lead times are one\nand zero periods. However, the generalization to arbitrary lead\ntimes creates a multi-state problem that is time consuming to\nsolve. And these papers do not consid er capacity constraints,\nwhich would further complicate the dynamic program.\nMoinzadeh and Nahmias (1988) develop a more general\nmodel that utilizes an order-point, order-quantity policy for\neach replenishment mode. They develop a heuristic policy\nunder a continuous review inventory model that is locally\noptimal. Moinzadeh and Schmidt (1991) examine the dual-mode\ninventory system for Poisson demand using an (S-1, S)\nreplenishment policy. Moinzadeh and Aggarwal (1997) extend\nthese results to account for a two-echelon inventory system.\nV. SOLUTION METHODS\nIn determining a solution method we considered three\nfactors:\nthe usefulness and applicability of a model to\nPolaroid's situation; the model simplicity and ease of use; and\nthe potential for adoption and implementation.\nWe first attempted to modify Moinzadeh and Nahmias's\nheuristic approach to more accurately reflect the Polaroid\nproblem.\nThese modifications included adding pipeline\ninventory costs to the cost equation, setting limits on the\nexpected number of backorders, and changing the solution\nmethod to account for production capacity constraints.\nUnfortunately, the model requires as input a demand\ndistribution in each period for each product, which Polaroid\ndeemed to be infeasible due to their monthly forecasting format\nand the highly variable nature of the forecasts. Also, since the\n\nplanners were to run the model, they needed to understand\nhow it worked.\nAny solution technique would to some degree have to make\nintuitive sense to the users of the model and be easy to use\nand update. Lay user might be incapable of understanding\nmodel output in the case of a multi-state dynamic program, or\nincapable of generating useful input in the case of a stochastic\ninventory model. As a result, we chose a solution strategy, by\nwhich we solve a simple deterministic model in each period in\norder to solve approximately the dynamic problem\nA. Polaroid Network Scheduling and Shipping Model\nFor our initial formulation we use a minimum-cost network\nflow model3 to determine the production and transportation\ndecisions for a single product over a finite horizon of n weeks,\nwhere production occurs in Asia and the product is to be\nshipped to the distribution center in Norton MA. . We depict\nthe network in Figure 1. We assume all costs are linear.\nThe network entails a root node s, a production node pi for\nevery period, a demand node dj, for every period, and a sink\nnode t.\nThere is an arc from the root node s to each production node\npi. Flow on this arc represents production in the period. An\nupper bound on this arc corresponds to a capacity constraint\non production, while a lower bound represents a minimum\nproduction level as might be dictated by contract. The flow\ncost for these arcs is the variable production costs.\nWe define arcs between the production nodes and the\ndemand nodes to correspond to shipment decisions. Let t1\nrepresent the lead-time associated with airfreight and t2\nrepresent the lead-time of ocean shipping. There is an air-\nshipment arc from the production node pi in period i to the\ndemand node dj=i+ t 1 in period i+t1, and a sea-shipment arc from\nthe production node pi in period i to the demand node dj=i+ t 2. in\nperiod i+t2. The cost on each of these arcs is the relevant\ntransportation cost for shipping by that mode, plus the\ninventory holding cost for the lead-time.\nThere is an arc from each demand node dj to the next\ndemand node dj+1. Flow on this arc corresponds to carrying\ninventory from one week to the next week. The cost of this\nflow is the holding cost for the inventory. We can set a lower\nbound on this arc to assure a certain level of safety stock in\neach week.\nThere is an arc from each demand node dj to the sink node t,\nwhere flow on this arc equals the demand satisfied in the\nperiod. The lower bound on each arc equals Polaroid's demand\nforecast in the period, thus assuring that the plan satisfies the\ndemand forecast. There is no cost on the flow on these arcs.\nWe can solve this problem with any minimum-cost network\nflow algorithm. The solution provides the amount to produce\nin each period, the amount to ship by each mode in each\n3 Ahuja, R. K., T.L. Magnanti, and J. B. Orlin, Network Flows: Theory,\nAlgorithms, and Applications, Prentice Hall, 1993, pg 749.\nperiod, and the inventory levels in the distribution center in\neach period.\nThere are several extensions that are worth mentioning. We\ncan permit multiple destinations and multiple production\nsources, and still preserve the network structure. We can also\npermit serial productions stages, whereby one stage produces\na component that feeds into a downstream stage that produces\nan assembly or subassembly, and so forth.\nB. Model Limitations and Recommended Use\nBecause this model is deterministic, we do not achieve an\noptimal solution when demand is stochastic. There are two\ncounter measures to overcome this limitation. First, by\nimposing constraints on the inventory, the model will build a\nbuffer against demand variation in order to prevent stockouts\nand to achieve a desired service level. Second, the model is to\nbe re-run at regular intervals (e. g., weekly) over a tactical\nplanning horizon (12 weeks in Polaroid's case). Every week,\nforecasts are updated, in -transits are added, new inventory\ntargets are calculated, and the model is run again.\nThe\nshipment decisions recommended by the model for period 1\nonly are carried out, and the model is re-run the following\nperiod using the previous periods shipments as in -transit\ninputs to the model. This iterative process allows the model to\ncorrect mistakes caused by forecast inaccuracy in early periods\nin subsequent periods.\nFor more strategic decisions involving new product\nintroductions the model can be a valuable planning aid. Before\na new product is introduced, an integrated new product team\nconsisting of representatives from manufacturing, sales,\nmarketing, and logistics meet to formulate strategic product\nparameters such as: the product launch window, tooling\ninvestments and manufacturing capacity, the ramp up period\nfor the product, etc. The network model can be useful in\nidentifying tradeoffs between these strategic decisions. By\nsetting the model horizon to represent the product lifecycle,\nthe model can reveal the effects that launch date and tooling\ncapacity decisions will have on lifecycle transportation costs.\nThe model will find the additional costs due to filling the\npipeline with air, rather than ocean, shipments, as well as the\nbenefits from additional tooling capacity. By allowing strategic\ncommittees to examine these tradeoffs, the model should help\nnew product teams make more educated decisions.\nSo far we have assumed that shipping costs were linear in\nthe volume shipped. Unfortunately, this is not true for\nshipping via ocean containers, for which there is a fixed price\nregardless of the amount shipped within a container. We can\nmodel this by modifying the ocean-shipment arcs in the\nnetwork problem. In particular we need to add a fixed cost to\nthese arcs, as well as an upper bound equal to the size of the\ncontainer. And we need to permit the possibility of multiple\nocean-shipment arcs being used in a week, representing the\nshipment of multiple containers. These modifications result in\nan integer program, for which a more complex algorithm is\n\nneeded.\nTable 1: Simulation results for network model. * Total costs\ncomputed for simulation, assuming the same number of units\nVI. MODEL TEST\nshipped as for actual.\nTo test the model we collected shipping, forecast, and\ndemand data for three Polaroid products over a six month\ninterval. We then did a retrospective simulation for how the\nmodel would have performed. We ran the simple network\nmodel week by week using the current week's 12-week forward\nforecast. For example, the January 2000 forecast's predictions\nfor January, February, and March, were used to drive the\nmodel for the first four weeks of January. The next four\niterations utilize the February forecast, and so on.\nThe\nshipping decisions of the model are then compared to the\nactual shipping decision made by the company to compare\ncosts and service levels. Many assumptions were necessary\nto conduct this validation test.\n1.\nShipping by air requires a lead time of two weeks\n2.\nSea shipments require a seven week lead time\n3.\nMonthly forecasts were converted into weekly\nforecasts, assuming uniform demand over the mo nth\n4.\nSafety stocks were set to four weeks of forward\ndemand, as was the policy used by the planners\n5.\nThere were no costs associated with stock-outs\n6.\nFor the purpose of comparison, we determined the\nactual costs and stock-outs assuming two and seven\nweek lead-times.\nThough the average delivery times for air and sea shipments\nare one and five weeks respectively for most products, we\nassume worst-case lead-times to make our inferences on model\nperformance more conservative. Weekly periods were used\ninstead of monthly since products are typically shipped from\nAsian factories in weekly batches.\nWe selected two color versions of the small consumer\ninstant camera, Joycam, along with Polaroid's low-end digital\ncamera, the PDC 300.\nJoycams were a perfect test case\nbecause they fit the mold of the new breed of Polaroid\nproducts. They were introduced in the beginning of 2000, were\nshipped from Asia to the U.S., and over the course of the year\nwere shipped both by air and sea. After seeing the Joycam\nmodel results, we chose the PDC300 to determine if a product\nthat had been exclusively shipped via airfreight could have\nbeen moved to the ocean in retrospect.\nWe simulated the Joycams for the first seven months of\n2000, and the PDC300 during the later half of 2000. In Table 1\nwe present the summary statistics (scaled to disguise actual\ncosts and volumes); more details on the simulation results are\nin Threatte (2001).\nJoycam 1\nJoycam2\nPDC300\nAverage per unit\nshipping cost - simulation\n0.28\n0.37\n0.58\nAverage per unit\nshipping cost - actual\n0.40\n0.56\n0.90\nTotal cost - simulation*\nTotal cost - actual\nInventory holding cost\n- simulation\nInventory holding cost\n- actual\nWe see from the table that the per-unit shipping costs are\nmuch lower, reflecting the greater use of ocean rather than air.\nThe inventory holding costs are also lower for the Joycam,\neven following the safety stock policy of maintaining four-\nweeks of stock on hand. For the PDC300, the actual inventory\ncosts are lower than the simulation, largely because the actual\ninventory was allowed to slip below the four-week target. We\nalso compared the total of the shipping and inventory costs,\nwhere we adjusted the simulated shipping costs to assume the\nsame amount shipped as for the actual.\nThere were no\ndifferences in service level as there were virtually no stock-\nouts in any of the cases.\nOne criticism of the prior test is that in many cases there\nwere small shipments. This is not much of a concern for air\ntransport as goods are loaded onto small pallets and\ntransportation costs are assessed by weight. However, small\nbatches shipped on ocean containers would have an extremely\nhigh cost per unit. We redid the simulation, using the integer\nprogramming model with three modes of shipment: LCL\nshipments, container load shipments, and airfreight. We made\nthe following additional assumptions for the IP model\nsimulation:\n1.\nLCL shipments require a seven week lead time\n2.\nLCL shipments were priced at twice the assumed\nper kilo weight of the sea shipments\n3.\nFull container load shipments require a lead-time of\nsix weeks and have a fixed cost of $6500.\n4.\nInventory arcs were added between production\nnodes to allow for the storage of inventory\nnecessary to fill a container prior to shipment.\nThe simulation with the IP model revealed a surprising\nresult. For products with limited tooling capacity, the model\nnever recommended the use of a full container shipment. The\nsimulated policies were the same as found from the linear-cost\nnetwork model. Average shipping costs were higher due to\nthe higher assumed cost of LCL shipments, but all\ntransportation and production decisions were the same.\n\nContainer shipments were never made because there was never\nenough slack production capacity to accumulate inventory at\nthe factory (see Threatte, 2001 for more details).\nVII. INVENTORY OPTIMIZATION\nSo far we have assumed Polaroid's inventory policy to\nmaintain four weeks of forward inventory. In this section we\nexamine this policy, and use the simple network model to\nexplore how parameters such as manufacturing capacity, safety\nstock levels, and forecast error variance affect transportation\nand inventory cost.\nWe examined seven new products that were recently\nintroduced to characterize their monthly forecast errors. When\ncomparing one-month forecasts with actual results (example:\nJanuary's forecast for February compared to February's\nactuals), it appears that Polaroid's forecasts are consistently\nhigher than actual sales.\nFrom subtracting actuals from\nmonthly forecasts and averaging this result across the life of\nthe product, the average forecast overstates actual results.\nThe following table summarizes the forecast results for seven\nnew Polaroid products4.\nTable 2: Forecast Accuracy\nProduct\nAverage\nOne-\nMonth\nForecast\nError\nStandard\nDeviation\nImplied\nStock-out\n%, with no\nsafety\nstock\nMonths\nObserved\nSilver Joycam\n13%\nSpectra 1200\n16%\nPDC320 Cam\n12%\nBlue Pocket\n13%\nRed Pocket\n5%\nGreen Pocket\n7%\nBlack Joycam\n12%\nThe fourth column of the chart specifies the percentage of\nactual demand that would have been subject to shortages if\nPolaroid built to forecast and made no attempts to hold any\nsafety stock. Polaroid's strong positive forecast bias creates a\nscenario where a no safety stock policy would result in service\nlevels between 84% and 93%. If the forecast were unbiased,\nwe would predict a 50% service level with no safety stock.\nWe developed a simulation to examine the relationships\nbetween transportation costs, system costs, and shortages to\nchanges in manufacturing capacity, safety stock, and forecast\nerror. We randomly generated demand for a hypothetical\nproduct with a cost function and demandprofile similar to the\nPolaroid Joycam. We assume an unchanging forecast for the\nentire year that featured quarterly periodicity and Christmas\nseasonality. We simulate the actual demand for a period by\ngenerating a normal random variable with a mean equal to the\n4 Note: The data of this table has been transformed in order not to\nreveal t he true Polaroid data which is confidential\nforecast and with a standard deviation that was a fixed fraction\nof the mean.\nRunning 12 model iterations successively\nsimulated a year. The yearly transportation costs, adjusted\ntotal costs, and shortages are then compared across scenarios.\nTotal costs are adjusted to reflect the cost assuming a fixed\nnumber of goods are shipped across scenarios.\nIn the simulation we set the safety stock levels using a fixed\nmanufacturing capacity and forecast error ratio. The first\nseries of runs were performed using a maximum production\ncapacity of 135 units/week, representing a manufacturing\ncapacity 110% above the average forecast. The standard\ndeviation of actual demand values was set at .1 of the forecast.\nTarget inventory levels for the model were calculated by\nsetting inventory at the forecasted value for the number of\nlead-time weeks specified, plus two standard deviations of the\ngenerated forecast error for the lead-time period. The\nexperiment was repeated for scenarios with a maximum capacity\n143% of average demand with demand standard deviations\nequal to .1 and .33 of the mean. The results of the simu lation\nare displayed in Table 3.\nTable 3: Results of simple network parameter simulation\n(averages, n=20)5\nResults with demand standard deviation =0.10 of mean\nand capacity = 135 units/week\nWeeks\nof\nsafety stock\nUnit\nshipping\ncost\nAdjusted\ntotal cost\nStock-outs\n0.2281\n0.2927\n0.3015\nResults with demand standard deviation =0.10 of mean\nand capacity = 175 units/week\nWeeks\nof\nsafety stock\nUnit\nshipping\ncost\nAdjusted\ntotal cost\nStock-outs\n0.1921\n0.2048\n27.8\n0.2416\nResults with demand standard deviation =0.33 of mean\nand capacity = 175 units/week\nWeeks\nof\nsafety stock\nUnit\nshipping\ncost\nAdjusted\ntotal cost\nStock-outs\n0.2686\n29.15\n0.3606\n6.55\n0.4505\n1.35\n5 Adjusted total costs reflect simulated inventory and shipping costs\nassuming a fixed number of items are shipped in each simulation run.\n\nThe simulation reveals several relations for the range of\ntests considered:\n-\nShortages increase with reduction in weeks of safety stock\n-\nTotal costs decrease with reductions in weeks of safety\nstock\n-\nTransportation costs decrease with lower safety stock,\nbecause more expediting is required to maintain high\ninventory levels\n-\nReductions\nin\nmanufacturing\ncapacity\nincrease\ntransportation and total costs while increasing incidence\nof shortages\n-\nReductions in manufacturing capacity increase the\nvariability of simulated results\n-\nIncreases in the forecast error percentage mimic the effects\nof reduced manufacturing capacity\nMost of these results are what would be expected in any\ninventory model.\nHowever, the fact that transportation\ncosts/unit decrease with reductions in safety stock levels may\nseem counter intuitive.\nThe reason is due to the increased\npressure placed on manufacturing to sustain high inventory\nlevels. Though demand is satisfied, often it must be met\nwithout being able to also match the particular period's\ninventory target. This leads to more incidences of expediting\nshipments via air, and hence increases the relative unit\ntransportation costs. Transportation cost in the model is\nespecially sensitive to forecast error and constraints in\nmanufacturing.\nVIII. RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\nFor a manager making discrete periodic shipping decisions,\nthe results of the simulation demonstrate that flexibility and\ncost are actually improved when inventory levels are reduced,\neven when manufacturing capacity is only 110% of average\ndemand. This discovery when combined with the implicit bias\nin the forecasts, should provide the basis for reducing the\ncurrent inventory target of four weeks of inventory. As further\nevidence, we note that the Joycam simulation had little if any\nshortages, even though the lead-times were set conservatively.\nThis paper develops a simple network-based model and\ndemonstrates its usefulness for tactical scheduling and\nshipping decisions. Validation of the simple model and its\nmore complicated IP counterpart demonstrated the following\nresults:\n-\nThe\nmodels\ncan\nsave\ntransportation\ncosts\nby\nrecommending increased use of ocean transport\n-\nThe models are effective in maintaining desired inventory\ntargets\n-\nThe simple network model is easier to imp lement than the\ninteger programming model\nSimulations using the simple network model were performed\nto analyze the relationships between transportation costs,\nsystem costs, and shortages to changes in manufacturing\ncapacity, safety stock, and forecast error. For the range of\nparameters that were tested, these simulation runs revealed the\nfollowing:\n-\nShortages increase with reduction in weeks of safety stock\n-\nTotal costs decrease with reductions in weeks of safety\nstock\n-\nTransportation costs decrease with reductions in weeks of\nsafety stock due to the need for less expediting\n-\nReductions\nin\nmanufacturing\ncapacity\nincrease\ntransportation and total costs while increasing incidence\nof shortages\n-\nReductions in manufacturing capacity increase the\nvariability of simulated results\n-\nIncreases in the forecast error percentage mimic the effects\nof reduced manufacturing capacity\nREFERENCES\n[1] Ahuja, R.
