Davidson\npresented by\nJonathan Reinharth\nFebruary 28, 2005\n\nBackground\nSource Memory:\nThe \"where\" and \"when\" of episodic memory\nCan include any contextual feature (not content)\nSource memory is affected by aging more than\nfact or item memory (Brown, Jones, & Davis, 1995; Trott, Friedman,\nRitter, Fabiani, & Snodgrass, 1999; 6 more studies)\nHypothesis: source memory relies on the integrity\nof the frontal lobes (Coffey et al, 1992; Raz, 2000)\nPatients with focal frontal lesions make more source\nmemory errors than control (Janowsky, Shimamura & Squire,\n1989)\nAmensics with FL lesions do poorly on source memory;\nthose without perform normally (Simamura & Squire, 1987)\nSupported with ERPs and fMRIs\n\nRelation between FL and Source Memory?\nContrary findings:\nAmnesic Korsakoff patients showed relation between FL\natrophy and item, not source, memory (Kopelman, 1989)\nFL atrophy predicts fact recall, not source memory (Spencer\n& Raz, 1994)\nSource memory correlated with MTL functioning (Henkel et al,\n1998)\nBoundary between contextual and content features ill-\ndefined; much crossover\nTrade-off between item and source memory? (Naveh-\nBenjamin & Craik, 1996)\nPerhaps FL activation in source memory tasks product\nof the greater difficulty of the tasks - i.e. search\nstrategies, decisions (Shallice, 1982; Moscovitch, 1994)\n\nExperiment 1: Methods\nQuestions for this study:\nProcesses in source memory, and FL involvement\nExperiment 1: older adults with high/low FL\nimpairment, high/low MTL impairment\n32 older adults from Glisky et al 1995, 8 from each\ngroup; 24 young adult undergrads\nNo differences in age, education, scores on MMSE\nTwo tests:\nlistened to 12-item list of voices, 3X, random order, then\nvoices again with either same or other sentence; recognition\nmemory test for voices (2AFC)\nSame setup; recognition memory test for sentence that each\nvoice spoke (also 2AFC)\n\nExperiment 1: Results\n2X2 ANOVA: main effects of age and\ntype of memory; no interaction\nVoices that spoke same sentence\nmore likely to be recognized than\ndifferent\nGreater effect in younger than older\n(\"same\" condition)\nNo effect of neuropsychological\ngroup (item and source)\nNo connection between difficulty and\nFL function\nLow FL group had difficulty with\nsource recognition\nRetrieval problem?
