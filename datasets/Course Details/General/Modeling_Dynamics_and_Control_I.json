  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nText\n\nThe text is a set of notes written by Prof. Trumper. These will be provided in periodic installments over the course of the semester. As a supplemental reference, consult either:\n\nPalm, William J.\nModeling, Analysis, and Control of Dynamic Systems.\n2nd ed. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1999. ISBN: 9780471073703.\n\nOgata, Katsuhiko.\nSystem Dynamics.\n4th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2003. ISBN: 9780131424623.\n\nRecitations\n\nStudents are required to attend their assigned recitation section. In almost all recitations, we will assign brief quizzes (about 5-10 min duration) to check on students' understanding of the homework material due at that recitation. These exercises will start at the beginning of recitation, so please come to class on time!\n\nLaboratory Sessions\n\nStudents will attend one assigned 3 hour lab session most weeks. You may\nnot\nswitch sessions without permission of the staff. Students will receive a grade of zero for missed lab sessions. We also reserve the right to move students between sections in order to level the loading on the lab facilities.\n\nA prelab will be assigned in the week preceding the lab exercise. The prelab is due at the start of the assigned lab session. Prelabs will not be accepted more than 5 minutes after the start of the lab session. Lateness to the lab will also reduce the lab portion of the student's score. Each student must submit an individual lab report at the end of the lab session. Lab reports will not be accepted after the end of the lab session.\n\nThe lab grade will be based upon the prelab (50%), and lab report scores (50%).\n\nHomework\n\nWeekly problem set assignments will be due on Friday in your\nassigned\nrecitation section. No late problem sets will be accepted; we also will not accept problem sets handed in to other recitation sections. We will be providing problem set solutions to many of the problems\nalong with\nthe problems themselves. The intention here is to provide you with a resource for getting unstuck on problems, and to have a chance to see how an experienced person solves a particular problem. Our stipulation is that you first try to solve the problems yourself without reference to the solutions. Only turn to the solutions if you need help once you are well-engaged with the problem and have made significant independent efforts. We also require that what you turn in accurately represents your own work and understanding of the material. We do not guarantee to provide solutions for all problems, especially those of a design or experimental character. Your understanding of the problem set material will be tested by short quizzes in most recitations. These quizzes should be easy for you to do if you've understood the homework material.\n\nQuizzes\n\nThree closed-book quizzes will be given during the term:\n\nQuiz 1 - Session 5\n\nQuiz 2 - Session 8\n\nQuiz 3 - Session 12\n\nThe quizzes are closed-book. One sheet of notes will be permitted in Quiz 1. Two sheets of notes will be permitted in Quiz 2, etc.\n\nFinal Exam\n\nA 3 hour closed-book final exam will be held during the final exam period. The final is closed-book. Four sheets of notes will be permitted in the final.\n\nGrading\n\nThe course grade will be based upon the students' performance in the following activities:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nLaboratories\n\n20%\n\nHomework\n\n15%\n\nRecitation Quizzes\n\n10%\n\n3 Lecture-period Quizzes\n\n25%\n\nFinal Exam\n\n30%\n\nThe department of Mechanical Engineering has adopted the following guidelines for the grade distribution in undergraduate courses: approximately 25% A, 40% B, 25% C, not more than 10% D and F. We will use this as a starting point in assigning grades; previous offerings of 2.003 have had grade distributions similar to this.\n\nCollaboration Policy\n\nCollaboration in the form of discussion between students is permitted and encouraged on the homeworks and prelabs, but what you turn in must be your individual solution. Of course, collaboration on quizzes or the final is prohibited.",

660\n\nChapter\nProblems\n\n1st Order Systems\n1.1\nFirst Order Time Constant\nThis problem concerns the first-order response shown in Figure 1.1.1.\nTime (sec.)\nAmplitude\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.5\n1.5\n2.5\n3.5\n4.5\n\nFigure 1.1.1: Plot of Response\n(a) What is the time constant of this response? (You can work directly on the given time response\nplot and turn this in as part of your homework.)\n(b) Show us a mechanical system which will give this response, under the assumption that the\nindicated response is angle in radians. What are possible numerical values of the system\nparameters and initial conditions that go with this response? Be sure to show your reasoning.\n\n1.2\nRise and Settling Times\nConsider the first-order system\nτy + y = u\ndriven with a unit step from zero initial conditions. The input to this system is u and the output\nis y. Derive expressions for the 10-90% rise time tr and the settling time ts, where the settling is\nto within an error ±Δ from the final value of 1. How many time constants are required in order to\nsettle to within an error of Δ = 10-6?\n\n1.3\nFirst Order System Response\nYou are given an equation of motion of the form:\ny + 5y = 10u\n(a) What is the time constant for this system?\n(b) If u = 10, what is the final or steady-state value for y(t)? Now assume that u = 0 (no input)\nand the system was started at some initial position yo, which you do not know. But, you do\nknow that 0.5 seconds later it was at a position y(0.5) = 2.\n(c) What was the initial condition y(0) that would lead to this result?\n(d) Sketch as accurately as you can, the time response for case (c) starting from t = 0 until the\nresponse is nearly zero, and indicate where the one data point at t = 0.5 would lie.\n(e) When does the response reach 2% of the initial value?\n(f) When does the response reach a value of 0.02?\n\n2nd Order Systems\n2.1\nSecond-Order System Response\nFor a system described by the homogenous equation:\n20 y + 160 y + 8000y = 0\nDetermine the solution y (t) for three different initial conditions:\n(a) y(0) = 0\ny (0) = 10\n(b) y(0) = 10\ny (0) = 0\n(c) y(0) = 1\ny (0) = 10\n(d) For all three cases, create a separate plot of y(t) using MATLAB, but be sure to use the same\nscale on all three plots.\n(e) Compare the time for each of the three plots to reach steady-state. Comment on how you\ncan make this comparison and why the three answers do or do not differ.\n\n2.2\nSecond Order Responses\nThis problem concerns the second-order response shown in Figure 2.2.1.\nTime (sec.)\nAmplitude\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n-200\n-100\n\nFigure 2.2.1: Second Order Response\nTime (sec.)\nAmplitude\n0.05\n0.1\n-200\n-100\n\nFigure 2.2.2: Zoomed Second Order Response\n(a) What are the natural frequency and damping ratio of this response? (You can work directly\n\non the given time response plot and turn this in as part of your homework paper.)\n(b) Show us a mechanical system which will give this response, under the assumption that the\nindicated response is position in millimeters. What are possible numerical values of the system\nparameters and initial conditions that go with this response? Be sure to show your reasoning.\n\n2.3\nSecond Order Derivation\nThe supplemental notes handed out in class give results for the position response of a second-order\nsystem to an initial condition of x0 = 0 and v0 = 1 for the underdamped, critically damped, and\noverdamped cases, in Equations (15), (16), and (17), respectively. However, these results are given\nwithout showing the derivation. Carry out the detailed calculations to verify these homogeneous\nresponses.\n\n2.4\nSecond Order Derivation Continued\nRepeat the results of Problem 2.3 for the different initial condition x0 = 1 and v0 = 0, showing\nthe details of your derivation, as well as an expression for the position as a function of time for the\nunderdamped, critically damped, and overdamped cases. Use Matlab to plot the resulting position\nas a function of time for each of the parameter sets of values used in Figures 15, 16, and 17.\n\nHigher Order Systems\n3.1\nStructure of Higher Order System Solutions\nAs we will see later in the term, the ship roll stabilizer problem can lead to an equation of motion\nthat is 4th order:\nd4x\nd3x\nd2x\nd2x\na4\n+ a3\n+ a2\n+ a2\n+ a0x = bu(t)\ndt4\ndt3\ndt2\ndt2\nWhere x would be the roll angle and u the desired stabilizer fin angle. Right now all we want\nto do is understand the basic nature and range of possible homogeneous solutions for this type of\nequation. For this problem we will not use LaPlace transforms, but instead rely on what we already\nknow about homogeneous solutions for linear ordinary differential equations. Assuming that u=0,\nconsider three different sets of parameters . a = a4 a3 a2 a1 a0 [ ]: Case I: . a = 1 10 35 50 24 [\n] Case II: . a = 1 8 42 85 50 [ ] Case III: . a = 1 7 135 550 2500 [ ] Assuming that only x(0) is\nnon-zero:\n(a) For each case, write out the basic form of the homogeneous solution where m is the number\nof complex conjugate root pairs and n-2m is the number of real distinct roots, leaving any\nreal coefficients as undetermined variables.\n(b) Describe (Briefly in words!) the resulting characteristic response.\n(c) Sketch an approximation of what it will look like, but do not solve for the ci or cj coefficients.\nHINT: You might find it useful to use the MATLAB command roots(a), which will find the roots\nof a polynomial whose coefficients are in a vector a.\n\n3.2\nStructure of Higher Order System Solutions\nAs we will see later in the term, the ship roll stabilizer problem can lead to an equation of motion\nthat is 4th order:\nd4x\nd3x\nd2x\nd2x\na4\n+ a3\n+ a2\n+ a2\n+ a0x = bu(t)\ndt4\ndt3\ndt2\ndt2\nwhere x would be the roll angle and u the desired stabilizer fin angle.

Assuming that u=0,\nconsider three different sets of parameters. a = [a4, a3, a2, a1, a0] :\nCase I: a =[1 10 35 50 24]\nCase II: a = [1 8 42 85 50]\nCase III: a = [1 7 135 550 2500]\nAssuming that only x(0) is non-zero:\n(a) For each case, write out the basic form of the homogeneous solution where m is the number\nof complex conjugate root pairs and n-2m is the number of real distinct roots, leaving any\nreal coefficients as undetermined variables.\n(b) Describe (briefly in words!) the resulting characteristic response.\n(c) Sketch an approximation of what it will look like, but do not solve for the ci or cj coefficients.\nHINT: You might find it useful to use the MATLAB command roots(a), which will find the roots\nof a polynomial whose coefficients are in a vector a.\n\nMechanical Systems\n4.1\nBalloon\nA string dangling from a helium-filled balloon has it's free end resting on the floor as shown in Fig.\n4.1.1. As a result the balloon hovers at a fixed height off the floor and when it is deflected a little\nfrom that height it oscillates up and down for a while, eventually returning to the same height.\nDevelop the simplest mathematical model competent to describe the vertical motion of the balloon.\nYou may take all the elements of your model to be linear.

The massless hoisting cable rolls with no slip over a pulley P and over two drums (of radii\nr1 and r2) attached rigidly to a gear of radius R. The combined inertia of the gear and the drums is J.\nA motor drives the pinion of radius r with an input torque τ. The transmission ratio of the gear\ndrive is Ng/Np, where Ng and Np are the number of teeth on the gear and the pinion respectively.\nNote that this ratio is the same as R/r.\nThe system is mounted on a rigid base fixed to the ground. To simplify our model, we neglect (i)\nfriction, (ii) inertia of the motor and the pinion and (iii) mass and inertia of the pulley P. The\ncable remains under positive tension at all times.

The drums are\ndriven directly by the motor in this new system. J, in this case, is the combined inertia of\nthe motor and the drums. If the value of J remains unchanged, calculate the value of torque\nτ that should be applied to the drums by the motor to achieve the same acceleration of 0.1 g\nfor the mass M.\n(e) Assuming that the cost of a motor is proportional to its torque output rating, does your\nanswer in Part (d) support the use of the gear transmission drive?

We now consider oscillations in the rotational speed of the propeller due to\ntorsional vibration of the short elastic coupler shaft connecting the propeller to the crankshaft. The\nsource of the oscillation is the fluctuating speed generated by the reciprocating engine.\nPeriodic firing of the cylinders in an internal combustion engine causes its rotational speed to vary\nperiodically. One stroke of a piston is one move from top dead center to bottom dead center (or\nfrom bottom to top). In a four-stroke engine, three strokes are used to clear out the products of\ncombustion from the previous firing, let in fresh air and fuel, and compress the mixture prior to\nfiring. It is only in the fourth stroke that the explosion occurs and a very large force on the piston\nexerts torque around the axis of the crankshaft. Ina four-cylinder engine the resulting torque on the\ncrankshaft is smoothed out considerably by arranging it so that one cylinder fires on every stroke.\nThe remaining fluctuation in torque, when applied to the inertia of the crankshaft, results in a\nfluctuation in the output speed of the engine, which varies in an approximately sinusoidal manner\nat the firing frequency, which is half the rotational frequency of the crankshaft. It is this periodic\nengine speed fluctuation which excites the torsional vibration.\nConsider the case of a four-cylinder 150 horsepower engine which operates between 500 and 2700\nrpm. The moment of inertia of the two-bladed propeller can be estimated to be the same as that of\na uniform solid rod of aluminum, six feet long and two inches in diameter (the density of aluminum\nis 2.72grams/cc). It is observed that the steady-state oscillations of propeller speed at the firing\nfrequency reach a peak amplitude when the engine runs at2200 rpm.

This\nsway is driven by wind pressure variations on the building. The building itself is an interconnected\nset of columns and beams, all with continuously distributed mass and elasticity. Assume that we\nwant to create a simple, lumped parameter model of this building to capture the sway motion\ndynamics.\nA measurement was made of this motion along with wind velocity, and the data is shown in\nFigures 4.30.1 and 4.30.2.\n(a) Propose a mechanical model to describe the motion that would lead to the equation:\nx + ax + bx = cu\nwhere x is the sway motion of the building and u is the force from the wind.

Suppose that the capacitor has\na value C = 120μF, and the battery voltage is Vbat = 1.2V. Also suppose that the largest inductor\nyou can use is L = 1 mH, and that this inductor has a maximum current limit of 0.1 A.\n(a) How much energy can be transferred from the inductor to the capacitor in one cycle?\n(b) How many cycles would be required to charge the capacitor from 0 to 300 volts? What\nfrequency of charging (in inductor charge/discharge cycles per second) would be required to\ndo this in one second?\n(c) What is the maximum charging frequency in cycles per second which is possible given the\nparameters for L, C, and Vbat above? Explain your reasoning. What changes could you make\nto the components to allow faster charging?\n\n5.2\nBatteries and Capacitors\nWith terminals shorted, a battery has a short circuit current defined as Isc. With its terminals\nopen, it has an open-circuit voltage defined as Voc. For example, a 1.5V AA cell as shown in the\nfigure 5.2.1\nFigure 5.2.1: AA Battery\ncan be modeled internally as a 1.5 V voltage source in series with an internal resistance Rb as\nshown in the figure 5.2.2\n\nFigure 5.2.2: AA Battery Schematic\nIf we eliminate the packaging details, this circuit appears more simply as figure 5.2.3, where Vb is\nthe voltage appearing at the battery terminals.\n-\n+\n+\n-\nFigure 5.2.3: Simplified battery circuit\n(a) With a short briefly applied to such a 1.5 V battery, I measured a current out of the +\nterminal and back into the - terminal of Isc = 5.7A. What is the value of Rb?\n(b) In the experiment above, how much power is the battery voltage source supplying? Where\nis it being dissipated? (Batteries are really not happy having a short-circuit applied to them\nfor any significant time, as they can dangerously overheat due to the internal dissipation.).\nAn electrolytic capacitor, as shown in the picture 5.2.4, allows a relatively large amount of\ncapacitance in a small package as compared with other types of capacitors. These capacitors\n\nare polarized, in the sense that they should only have voltage applied of the indicated polarity.\nReversal of voltage can be hazardous, and cause failure or explosion.\nFigure 5.2.4: Electrolitic capacitor of a single use flash camera\nThe capacitor shown is used to provide a pulse of current used to fire a flash lamp in a single\nuse camera.\nAfter the capacitor is charged, we observe that the capacitor voltage bleeds away to zero over\nthe course of about 30 minutes. This internal loss can be modeled by including a leakage\nresistor Rl in parallel with the capacitor as shown in figure 5.2.5.\n+\nFigure 5.2.5: Electrolitic capacitor model\nIf we eliminate the packaging details, this circuit appears more simply as in figure 5.2.6.\n\n+\n+\n-\nFigure 5.2.6: Electrolitic capacitor circuit\nThe + sign is usual to indicate that this is an electrolytic capacitor, as well as its associated\nallowed polarity.\n(c) Suppose that C = 120uF , and that we observe that from an initial charge it takes 10min for\nthe capacitor voltage to fall to 37 percent of its initial value. What is the value of the leakage\nresistor Rl?\nNow, we want to study using the battery to charge the capacitor. At t = 0, the battery is\nconnected to the initially uncharged capacitor.\n(d) Draw a circuit diagram showing this connection.\n(e) Write a differential equation which discribes the behavior of the circuit in this connection.\nThe differential equation should be written in terms of the capacitor voltage vc.\n(f) From the initially uncharged state at t = 0, write a solution vc(t) for this charging process.\nWhat is the associated time constant? Make a dimensioned graph of vc(t) and show the time\nconstant on this graph. Where is the system pole located? Make an s-plane sketch showing\nthis pole location.\nAfter charging for a long time, the capacitor voltage reaches a final, or steady state value.\nThen, at time t1, the battery is disconnected from the capacitor.\n(g) Write a differential equation which describes the behavior of the capacitor voltage vc(t) in\nthis disconnected condition. Solve the differential equation for vc(t), t > t1, and make a\ndimensioned sketch of vc(t). Where is the system pole located? Make an s-plane sketch\nshowing this pole location.\n\n5.3\nLoaded Motor\nThis problem considers the motor system shown below.\nFigure 5.3.1: Loaded Motor\nThe motor in Figure 5.3.1 is driven by a voltage source V through a switch, which can be opened\nand closed. The motor internal coil resistance is modeled by the resistor R as shown. The motor\nitself is ideal and described by the relations τ = Ki, and e = Kω, where τ is the torque applied\nto the load, and ω is the load speed. The load consists of a rotary inertia J, and a rotational\ndamper b.\n(a) Suppose the system is initially at rest. At t = 0 the switch is closed. Solve for the resulting\nrotor speed as a function of time, and write an expression for ω(t) in terms of the system\nparameters. Clearly show the steps in your solution. Make a labeled and dimensioned sketch\nof ω(t).\n(b) After the switch has been closed for a long time, the switch is opened. Let's call this opening\ntime t1. Solve for the resulting rotor speed as a function of time for t > t1, and write an\nexpression for ω(t) in terms of the system parameters. Clearly show the steps in your solution.\nMake a labeled and dimensioned sketch of ω(t).\n(c) Solve for the value of the coil current i as a function of time throughout the motions deter\nmined above, and write an expression for i(t) in terms of the system parameters.

The central shaft rotates at an arbitrary velocity\nΩ1(t) in a fluid filled cup, which is fixed. Unlike Lab 2, there is an intermediate ring, of inertia J.\nThis ring is supported on bearings which are not shown in the figure. The ring rotates with angular\nvelocity Ω2(t) as shown.\nThe fluid-filled annuli create a damper c1 between the shaft and the ring, and a damper c2 between\nthe ring and the cup. Assume that any other damping is negligible.\n(a) Draw a free-body diagram for the ring showing the torques acting on the ring.\n(b) Use this free-body diagram to derive a differential equation in terms of Ω1(t) and Ω2(t) which\ndescribes this system. Note that Ω1(t) is an arbitrary velocity which is externally specified.\n(c) Assume that Ω1(t) is a step, i.e., Ω1(t) = us(t), and that Ω2(0) = 0. solve for the resulting\nmotion Ω2(t) for t ≥ 0.\n(d) In steady-state, what torque must be exerted on the input shaft?

(Why indoors? Why in the basement?\nWhy with a hockey stick? Why didn't she ask if this was a good idea? If these questions haven't\noccurred to you, you aren't a parent yet.)\nAnyway, taking an especially sharp turn, she slides out skates first into the pipes where they connect\nto the pressure tank which breaks them off essentially instantaneously. With calm engineering\ndetachment, we will model this \"event\" as taking the pressure rapidly to zero, i.e., as Ps(t) =\n3 × 105(1 - us(t)) [Pa].\nPs(t) [Pa]\nt [s]\n3 . 10\n5 [Pa]\nFigure 6.3.2: Pressure function\n(a) Use the model and parameters from the example problem.

(The water pump is valiantly trying to restore pressure to Ps = 3 105\n·\nPa). We leave the next steps to your imagination...\n(c) If all of this seems a bit rigorous, perhaps you lack the stern constitution required for parent\nhood?\n(d) (Adapted from a true story).\n\nThermal Systems\n7.1\nThermal Block Question\nA block of copper is brought out of an oven at an initial temperature of 1000 K, and allowed to\ncool to the ambient temperature of 300 K. The graph below shows data which might represent this\nexperiment. The copper block has a mass of 0.1 kg. Given that copper has a specific heat of 385\nJ , propose a thermal model of this experiment, and write the equation of motion. Given the\nkgoC\nexperimental data, determine the value of thermal resistance to ambient. Clearly show the steps\nin your derivation.\ntime (s)\nTblock(K)\nTamb\nFigure 7.1.1: The block temperature (Tblock) is plotted against time (t). The ambient temperature\nis given by Tamb.\n\n7.2\nThe Hot Copper Block 1\nThis problem considers the thermal dynamics of water and a copper block inside a vacuum bottle.\nA diagram for the system is shown below in Figure 7.2.1.\nFigure 7.2.1: Copper block and water thermal system\nInitially, a 100 gm copper block is heated outside the bottle in an oven to a temperature of 95*C.\nWe are not concerned with the heating process. The water in the vacuum bottle has been there for\na long time and is equilibrated to the ambient temperature Ta = 25*C.\nAt t = 0, the stopper is removed, the copper block is lowered into the bottle, and the stopper is\nreplaced. Now we would like to develop a model which can describe the temperature dynamics as\na function of time.\nThe system parameters are as follows: The copper block has a mass of 100 gm; copper has a specific\nheat of 0.385 J/gm*C= 385J/kg*C. The bottle contains 1 liter of water; water has a specific heat\nof 4.2 J/gm*C= 4200J/kg*C.\nThe temperature of the block is defined as Tb. The water is assumed uniform in temperature, with\na value of Tw.\nThe heat flow from the block to the water is defined as qbw [W]. The heat flow from the water\nto ambient is defined as qwa [W]. These flows are modeled as passing through thermal resistances\nRbw = 0.1*C/W and Rwa = 17*C/W, respectively. Note: Take a look at the 2nd order ther\nmal example on the course web page before attempting this problem.\n\n(a) Write the governing differential equations for the system in state-space form as\ndTw = f1(Tw, Tb, Ta)\ndt\ndTb = f2(Tw, Tb)\ndt\nwhere f1 and f2 are linear functions.\n(b) Convert this representation to a 2nd order differential equation in Tw(t). You may assume\nthat the ambient temperature is constant, and thus dTa = 0.\ndt\n(c) Solve for the response Tw(t) for t ≥ 0. What are the system natural frequencies? Plot the\nsystem poles on an s-plane plot.\n(d) Use Matlab to plot Tw(t), and its two constituent modes, over an interesting time range.\nYou may need to use two plots with different time scales to capture the dynamics. Explain\nqualitatively why the plot looks as it does. Can you show us the effect of the system time\nconstants?\n(e) Suppose the block were initially at only 60*C. Make a sketch on your time response plot of the\nresulting Tw(t). Explain your reasoning. (Hint: If you exploit linearity, this should require\nno new calculations.)\n\n7.3\nThe Hot Copper Block 2\nThis problem is a continuation of Problem 7.2. Reconsider the system of Problem 7.2, but with\nan electrical heater added to the inside of the copper block. The heater provides an input power\nqin = 4 W. This new system is shown in Figure 7.3.1. The system starts at t = 0 in a rest state\nwith Tb = Tw = Ta = 25*C. At t = 0, the heater is turned on.\nq in\nFigure 7.3.1: Copper block and water thermal system with heater\n(a) Write the governing differential equation in terms of water temperature Tw.\n(b) Solve the differential equation for Tw(t), with the numerical values given in Problem 7.2.\n(c) Use MATLAB to plot Tw(t) over both a short and long time interval to show the interesting\nparts of the graphs. What is the steady-state value of Tw? What is the 10% to 90% rise time\ntr? How long does the response take to settle within 1% of the final value?\n\n7.4\nTransistor on heat sink\nFigure 7.4.1 is a schematic cross-section of a power transistor mounted on a heat sink. The tran\nsistor itself is fabricated on a thin piece of silicon, perhaps 5mm x 5mm x 0.5mm. This device\nis mounted within a package (case) which provides mechanical protection as well as electrical and\nthermal connections to the outside world. The case is mounted on a finned heat sink in order to\ntransfer heat dissipation in the transistor into the ambient air.\nFigure 7.4.1: Transistor Schematic\nThe case of most transistors needs to be electrically insulated from the heat sink. This is ac\ncomplished with the indicated thermal washer, which has the conflicting requirements of thermal\nconduction and electrical insulation.\nWe define the device temperature as Td, the case temperature as Tc, and the heat sink temperature\nas Ts. The ambient temperature is Ta = 25*C. The thermal resistance between the device and case\nis Rdc, between the case and heat sink is Rcs, and between the heat sink and air is Rsa.\nThe transistor is used as an electrical switch or amplifier. In the process electrical power is converted\nto heat. The heat flow needs to be managed without allowing the device to become too hot\n(generally the device temperature should stay below 100*C).\n(a) Assume Rdc = 0.1*C/W, Rcs = 0.2*C/W, and Rsa = 0.5*C/W. Further assume that in\nsteady-state the transistor is dissipating 50W. What are the steady-state values of Td, Tc,\nand Ts?\n(b) Now assume the heat sink is constructed with 500gm of aluminum, which has a specific heat\nof 0.90 J/g*K.

Input components\naway from the resonant frequency will be attenuated; the degree of attenuation will depend upon\nthe separation between the driving and resonant frequencies.\nIs\nC\nL\niC\niL\n+\n_\nvL\n+\n_vC\nR\n+\n_\nvR\niR\nFigure 8.3.1: Bandpass Filter Circuit\nAn example of the use of such a filter would be at the front end of a radio. Here the filter is used\nto select a particular radio station carrier frequency for listening, and to attempt to reject other\nradio station carrier frequencies. In this situation, the current i would represent current from the\nantenna attached to the radio, and the output signal vR would represent a voltage used in the radio\nfor further processing.\nIn this problem, the numerical values have been selected to tune the filter to a Boston-area FM\nradio station. We ask you to work out the frequency response function for the filter and then\nconsider how much an adjacent station's signal is attenuated. For the purposes of this problem,\nassume that radio stations emit a pure sinusoidal signal at their carrier frequency. So, for example,\na station such as WBCN operates at 104.1 MHz (104.1 × 106 Hz). Although the real signal consists\nof a band in the vicinity of this frequency, we will assume that the station puts out a pure sine\nwave at 104.1 MHz, and that this is what the filter is processing. In this problem, be careful to\nkeep track of what frequencies are in Hz and what frequencies are in rad/sec.\n(a) Solve for the differential equation which relates the input current Is to the output voltage vR.\nShow the steps in your derivation.\n(b) Use the results of a) to derive the transfer function from input I(s) to output VR(s).\n(c) In terms of the circuit parameters, what are the values of the natural frequency ωn and the\ndamping ratio ζ?

Can you see why it is called a bandpass filter? What is the center frequency of\nthe filter in MHz? What Boston-area radio station operates at this frequency?\n(f) In a given area, radio stations are generally spaced in frequency by at least 400 kHz. Use\nthe frequency response function to determine how much attenuation will be experienced by a\nsignal at 400 kHz above the filter resonant frequency.

Refer\nto Prelab 2 for more details. In the prelab, you are asked to calculate the moment of inertia for the\nshaft with and without the flywheel, and to use the video shown on the course web page to extract\nan estimate of the damping coefficient c resulting from the honey in the cup at the bottom of the\nshaft. Note that in the video the flywheel is attached to the shaft, and so for this problem you will\nuse the inertia value with the flywheel present. Use the following values in this problem:\nK = 10-2Nm , I = 0.000317kg - m2 and c = 0.0011N-m-sec/rad\nFlywheel\nAirbearings\nCup with\nviscous fluid\nShaft\nFigure 10.12.1: Rotational System\n\nω(t)\nc\nI\nFigure 10.12.2: Lumped System Model\n(a) Assume that the Lab 2 system is driven by an input torque Tin acting on the rotating shaft,\nand has a resulting angular velocity ω. Write a differential equation which describes the\nsystem with the given torque input.\n\n(b) Now assume that the torque is a step of magnitude K, i.e., Tin = Kus(t), and that the shaft\nhas an initial angular velocity ω(0) = ω0. Find the particular and homogeneous solutions and\ncombine these to write an expression for the total solution. Given the input magnitude K,\nfor what initial velocity will the solution reach final value in zero time, i.e., there will be no\ntransient?\n(c) Accurately sketch the solutions for K = 10-2 Nm, and for each of the following initial angular\nvelocities: ω0 = 0 rad/sec; ω0 = 40 rad/sec.\n(d) Now we change the torque source to a sinusoidal input Tin = us(t)K cos Ωt . Again the system\nhas an initial angular velocity ω(0) = ω0. Note that the step function us(t) which multiplies\nthe cosine function \"turns on\" the input at t = 0.The homogeneous solution will have the\nsame form as in part b), so you will not need to repeat this calculation. We ask you to find\nthe particular solution in two ways. The first is by using only trigonometric functions, and\nno complex variable representations. The second approach is by writing the input as the real\npart of a complex exponential.\n(i) Solve for the particular solution ωp(t) to the cosinusoidal drive without making use of\ncomplex notation. You'll need to work through some trigonometric identities to work\nout the solution.\n(ii) Solve for the particular solution ωp(t) to the cosinusoidal drive by using complex nota\ntion. That is, we recognize that the input can be expressed as Tin = Re{us(t)KejΩt}.\nThen because the system is linear, we can first solve for the particular solution for a\ncomplex-valued input Tin = us(t)KejΩt, taking the real part of the solution at the end\nto find the particular solution for the original real-valued input. The solution should be\nthe same as you found in part i). As you'll see, the math is simpler via this path than\nfor the solution taken in i) by using trigonometric identities. As the system order grows\nlarger than this first-order example, this simplification becomes more significant.\n(e) Assume that the initial shaft velocity is zero, i.e., ω0 = 0. For the particular solution to the\nsinusoidal drive that you found above, what homogeneous solution is required to satisfy this\ninitial condition?

Specifi\ncally,consider a system with input u and output y described by the differential equation\nτy + y = au + u\nNote that this system has a pole at s = -1/τ and a zero at s = -1/a.\n(a) Write an analytical solution for the response of this system to a unit step, assuming zero\ninitial conditions. Use impulse matching to work through the transient at t = 0, and use the\napproach of particular and homogeneous solutions to solve the problem. Do not use Laplace\ntransform techniques.\n(b) We now want to study the step response for a number of values of the parameter a. Let τ =\n0.1 sec,and sketch the step response for each the following values: a = 0.05, 0.09, 0.11, 1, -1, -.1.\nYou should be able to sketch the response by hand, without any need for computational as\nsistance. Along with the step response, include a pole-zero plot showing the locations of the\npole and zero on thes-plane.\n(c) Collocated poles and zeros in some sense cancel each other. Argue that if we let a = τ =\n0.1 sec, then the system reverts a simple gain of 1 from input to output, that is, from a\ncondition of initial rest, the output at all times equals the input. What is the step response\nfor this choice of parameters? Show that your response in part b) above approaches this\nresponse in the limit a = τ. Can you see this asymptotic behavior in the step responses\nyou've plotted in part b)?\n(d) Another way to think about zeros is that they allow properly chosen exponential inputs with\nno corresponding output. Specifically, assume that the input takes the formu(t) = es1t . Show\nthat by the proper choice of s1, the driven output is identically zero. How is this value of s1\nrelated to the zero location?\n(e) Solve for the step response from a zero initial condition via Laplace techniques. This should\nyield the same result as you found in part (a).\n\n12.2\nLaplace Practice\nA signal w(t) is defined as\nw(t) = us(t) - us(t - T )\nwhere T is a fixed time in seconds and us(t) is the unit step.

This is the same as allowing a non-unity value\nof ωn and making all plots with respect to ωnt. For this transfer function:\n(a) Plot on the s-plane the poles and zero as a function of α for the values α = 0.1, 1, 10,and\nfor ζ = 0.01, 0.1, 0.7. Make a separate plot for each value of ζ, showing the effect of α on\nthe zero location. Clearly label the pole and zero locations on the real and imaginary axes.\nNote that you cannot use a linearly scaled pole/zero plot if you want to show the pole and\nzero locations with adequate resolution.\n(b) Use Laplace techniques to derive an analytical expression for the response of this system y(t)\nto a unit step u(t) = uS (t) from initial condition y(0) = y (0) = 0. Carefully show all steps.\nBe sure to include an expression which gives the output transform Y (s) in terms of the\ninput transform U(s). Expand this expression in terms of given entries in a table of Laplace\nTransforms, performing inversion from the Laplace Transform to a function of time.\n(c) Use Matlab to plot the response function you have derived versus time and for the values of α\nand ζ listed in part a). Include separate plots for each value of ζ, which overlay the variation\nwith α. How does the zero location affect the step response? Can you see that the term s/αζ\ncontributes a derivative effect in the step response?

It can be thought of as a\nseries of ramps repeating at a frequency of ωo. The purpose of this problem is to see how different\ndynamic systems, each with a different transfer function G(s), will react to that signal. To do this,\nwe can make use of the Fourier series, that states that any periodic function f(t) can be described\nby an infinite series:\ninf\nf(t) = ao +\n[an cos (nωot) + bn sin (nωot))]\nn=1\nwhere:\nZ\nt1+T\nan =\nf(t)cos (nωot) dt\nT\nt1\n2 Z t1+T\nbn =\nf(t)sin (nωot) dt\nT\nt1\nwhere ωo is the fundamental frequency of the waveform.\n(a) Using references you might have from 18.01/2/3, determine the appropriate Fourier Series for\nthe triangle wave shown below\n(b) For each of the transfer functions below, sketch (not using MATLAB) the Bode diagram.\nG1(s) = τs\nK\n+1 with K = 10, τ = 20.\nK\nG2(s) = (τ1+1)(τ2+1) with K = 1, τ1 = 5, and τ2 = 10.\nsω2\nn\nG3(s) = s2+2ζωns+ωn\n2 with ζ = 0.5 and ωn = 50.\nK\ns\nωzns+ω2\n2+2ζz\nzn\nG4(s) = τs+1 s2+2ζωns+ω2\nwith K = 1, τ = 0.01, ζ = 1.0, ωn = 100, ζz = 0.05, and\nn\nωzn = 10.\n(c) Using the diagram only, write the steady-state output y(t) that would result if the triangle\nwave u(t) of Figure 12.9.1 were applied to the input of each transfer function.

A negative-feedback system used to rotate a rooftop antenna is shown in\nFigure 13.1.1(a). The total inertia of the output member (antenna, motor armature, and poten\ntiometer wiper) is 2kg-m2. The motor can be modeled as a resistor in series with a speed-dependent\nvoltage generator as shown in Figure 13.1.1(b).\nFigure 13.1.1: Antenna Diagram\nThe torque provided by the motor that accelerates the total output-member inertia is 10 Nm per\nampere of motor current Ia. The polarity of the motor dependent generator is such that it tends\nto reduce the value of Ia as the motor speed increases. The scale factor is such that Ia becomes\nzero for a motor shaft velocity equal to Vm/10 rad/sec.\n(Note: There are a number of repeated analyses in this problem. You will want to use Matlab to\nautomate these. The problem shows some of the key tradeoffs associated with feedback control,\nso please do think carefully about what you observe as the controller gain is changed through the\nvalues 10, 100, and 1000.)\n(a) Draw a block diagram that relates θo to θi. You may include as many intermediate variables\n\nas you wish, but be sure to include Vm and Ia in your block diagram. Calculate the transfer\nfunction θo/θi.\nAlso include in your block diagram a torque disturbance Td applied to the antenna shaft. For\ninstance, this torque disturbance might represent the effect of wind on the antenna. Calculate\nthe transfer function θo/Td which represents the response to such a disturbance.\n(b) Plot the system poles in the s-plane. Calculate the response in θo to a 1 rad step input θi.\nPlot this response showing relevant time scales.\n(c) Generate the Bode plot for θo/θi.\n(d) Calculate the unit step response and Bode plots for the disturbance transfer function θo/Td.\n(e) Calculate the transfer function of the negative of the loop transmission for this feedback loop.\nPlot a Bode plot for this transfer function. What are the crossover frequency and phase\nmargin for this loop? (These terms have been discussed in lecture.)\n(f) Now change the gain of the differential amplifier in the loop from 10 to 100. (This will increase\nthe loop transmission magnitude by a factor of 10.) Repeat parts (b), (c), (d), and (e) with\nthis new value of loop gain. Comment on the effect of this larger loop gain on the system\nclosed-loop dynamics exhibited in the speed and damping of the step response, Bode plots,\ncommand following ability, and the ability to reject a disturbance torque. How do the poles\nmove as the gain is increased?\n(g) Repeat the analysis of part (f) for an amplifier gain of 1000.\n\n13.2\nLead Controller\nWe now extend the laboratory system to consider position control, and the design of a lead con\ntroller. The system transfer functions used in the lab all refer to the motor output shaft angle θm.\nWe will define the potentiometer shaft angle as θp. The potentiometer is geared down from the mo\ntor by 6:1. That is, nd = 6np, and thus 6θp = θm. Further, the potentiometer outputs Vpot = ±10 V\nfor a potentiometer shaft rotation of θp = ±π rad.\n(a) Show that the relationships above imply that Vpot = Kpotθp, where Kpot = 10/π V/rad. Note\nthat we have defined Kpot as depending linearly upon θp.\n(b) Modify the block diagram of Fig. 2 of the prelab to include the motor angle θm, the po\ntentiometer angle θp, and the potentiometer gain Kpot. Use this modified block diagram to\ncalculate the transfer function Vpot/Vin. (Recall that Vin is the amplifier input voltage as\nshown in the prelab.) Sketch the poles of this transfer function as well as its Bode plot.\n(c) Now assume that the motor position controller is a lead controller of the form\nVin(s)\n10τs + 1\n= K\n.\nE(s)\nτs + 1\nHere E(s) = R(s) - Vpot(s), where R(s) is a position reference voltage, and E(s) is thus\nthe position error. The controller is embedded in the position feedback loop as shown in\nFigure 13.2.1.\nFigure 13.2.1: Block Diagram\nChoose the controller parameters K and τ to achieve a loop crossover frequency ωc =\n100 rad/sec, and phase margin φ ≥ 45*. Explain how you developed a design satisfying\nthese design values. Include a Bode plot of the negative of the loop transmission which\nshows that you have achieved these design values. Also include a plot of the closed-loop pole\nlocations.\n\n13.3\nThird Order\nConsider the mechanical drive of Problem 14.1 with the load free to move. The model parameters\nhave the following values:\nIrotor = 5e-5 kg-m2\nBmotor = 1e-4 N-m-s/r\nBcoupler = 2e-5 N-m-s/r\nKcoupler = 1.24e-2 N-m/r\nIload = 5e-5 kg-m2\nBload = 1e-4 N-m-s/r\nThis is a system with fairly special symmetry. Note that Imotor = Iload = I,and that Bmotor =\nBload = B. For this special case, develop a model to predict the angular velocity of the load in\nresponse to an applied motor torqueTm.\n(a) Use the variables:\nΔθ, relative angular displacement of motor with respect to load,\nωm, motor angular velocity, and\nωl, load angular velocity,\nas the state variables for this model in a state-determined system. Construct the state\nequations for this model.\n(b) Consider a change of variables to the following three variables:\nΔθ,\nΔω = ωm - ωl,\nand\nωavg = ωm + ωl\nExpress the variables ωm and ωl in terms of the variablesΔω, and ωavg.\n(c) Re-write the state-determined system using Δθ,Δω, and ωavg as state variables. Show that\nthe dynamic behavior of the system may be viewed as a combination of a first-order system\nwith state variable ωavg and a second-order system with state variables Δθ, and Δω. Note\nthat both sub-systems are excited by the motor torque Tm but are otherwise independent of\none another.\n(d) Evaluate the first-order behavioral parameter: the decay time-constantτ.\nEstimate the\nsteady-state speed ωss when Tm = 6.0e-3 N-m.\n(e) Evaluate the second-order behavioral parameters: the undamped natural frequency ωo, and\nthe damping ratio ζ.\n\n13.4\nError Constants\nFigure 13.4.1:\n\n13.5\nSystem Type\nUsing the same controller form as above, you are given a transfer function\nG(s)\ns(s2\n10s\n400)\nBy the above definitions, this is a type 1 system, and should have zero error to a step (or\n\"displacement\") input. However, the velocity error (that resulting from a ramp input)\nwill not be zero. Indeed our goal is to achieve a velocity error of < 2%.\nFor this we can explore two different approaches.\na) First plot a bode diagram of G(s)\nb) From that diagram, what will be the velocity error if the closed-loop system has a\nphase margin of 50o? (That is, after you have found a loop gain to achieve the phase\nmargin)\nc) Since the error is too large, a former 2.003 student tells you simply to increase the\nsystem type from 1 to 2 and all your problems will be over: just look at the error table!\nGood advice or not? - Please explain by looking at the resulting open loop bode\ndiagram.\nNow look at the alternative of using a lag compensator.\nd) Given that we want a velocity error < 2%, design a lag compensator that will achieve\nthat result without changing the phase margin at the crossover frequency you found in\npart b). Show the final Bode plot to confirm the result\ne) Now plot the resulting step response of the system designed in part d) How does it\ncompare to the expected values?\nf) Looking at the closed-loop system response to a ramp input, confirm that you have\nachieve a steady-state velocity error of 1%\nWhere G(s) is the loop transfer function and K is the DC loop gain.\nKG(s)\nR(s)\nY(s)\nE(s)\nFigure 13.5.1:\n\n13.6\nUnity Feedback\nConsider the feedback system of Figure 13.6.1 in block diagram form where G(s) = 1/s.\nKc\nG(s)\n-\nR(s)\nY(s)\nFigure 13.6.1: System with unity feedback\n(a) Determine the closed-loop transfer function T (s) = Y (s)/R(s) for this system.\n(b) Find the gain Kc that will result in a closed-loop step response with a settling time of 1\nmillisecond.\n(c) On a single Bode magnitude plot, show the following:\n- G(s)\n- T1(s) for K = 1\n- T2(s) for K = 10\n- T3(s) for K = 100\nBe sure to label each plot clearly.\n(d) If we define bandwidth as the range of frequencies over which the magnitude is > 0.5, what\nare the corresponding bandwidths of the three T (s) plots in part (c)?

Plot the Bode plot for this transfer function. What\nare the crossover frequency and phase margin for this loop? Also plot the closed-loop poles.\n(c) For the proportional-integral velocity loop, the controller has the form\nτs + 1\nK\n.\ns\nIn the prelab, you have calculated values of K and τ to locate the poles with ζ = 0.5 and\nωn = 30. In part b) above, you have looked at this design from a loop transmission perspec\ntive. Now we want to consider the design as it is affected by the loop phase margin.\nIn this section, modify the PI controller so that you achieve a crossover frequency of 200\nrad/sec, with a phase margin of 15 degrees. What values of K and τ result? Be sure to\nexplain how you arrived at these parameter values. Plot the closed-loop poles that result.\nWhat are the values of ζ and ωn associated with these new root locations? How do these root\nlocations compare with the values in part b)?

In this system, we assume\nthat the motor torque is related linearly to current τm = Kim, and thus that the motor voltage is\ngiven by vm = Kωm. We further assume that the motor coil has zero resistance R = 0 and zero\ninductance L = 0. The capacitor C is connected to the motor terminals as shown. The motor rotor\nhas a moment of inertia J.\nAssume that the motor is driven with a torque source, i.e., that τin is specified as an external input\nindependent of the shaft speed. The shaft of the torque source is rigidly connected to the motor\noutput shaft as shown in the figure. The torque source is massless.\nNote that we have defined the reference direction for motor speed ωm to be the same as that for\nthe source speed ωin.

This file is listed below, and is available for download from the course web site.\nMost of you have probably played with a simple spirograph made from a sheet of plastic. In such\na device, an inner gear of some radius rolls inside an internal gear of larger radius. A pencil is\ninserted in the inner gear in one of a number of possible locations. As the inner gear rolls, the pencil\nthus traces out a trajectory on a piece of paper lying under the spirograph. The spirograph has a\nnumber of choices for the sizes of the inner and outer gears, which result in interesting variations\nin the generated patterns.\nUnfortunately, the instructor was too lazy to add much in the way of comments when he wrote the\nfile. Your job is to look through this file to understand the underlying geometry and computations.\nSpecifically, we ask you to:\n(a) Develop a diagram which explains the geometry which is being computed.

SIMULINK lets you create block diagrams of dynamic systems, invoke\nfeedback control designs and then \"run\" the system to see the predicted performance.\nTo get started, simply type \"Simulink\" in the MATLAB command window. The GUI will then include a\nmenu of various block options, along with a model window in which you build the system. For example,\nthe simple velocity servo we have discussed in class would look like this in SIMULINK:\ns +as\nTransfer Fcn\ntime\nTo Workspace1\noutput\nTo Workspace\nSum\nStep\nScope\nK\nGain\nClock\nAnd if I set K=5 and a = 1 in the command window, the simulation (using default simulation parameters)\nbecomes:\nFigure 15.3.1:\n\nFor this assignment I encourage you to look at the various blocks in SIMULNIK and to run some of the\nDEMOS.\nIn addition, please look at the following:\nConsider the problem we have done in class: The PI control of the velocity servo. However, here we\naddress the problem of noise in the velocity measurement. This is typically done with a tachometer (really\na generator) and leads to high frequency noise from the brushes in the generator. As a result, we often\nplace a \"low pass filter\" in the feedback loop. Thus:\nH(s)\nK f\nW f s 1\nLet's look at this effect by using both analysis and SIMULINK simulation:\na) First create the model of the PI controller for the velocity servo:\nSum\nStep\nKp\ns+a\nPlant\ns+z\ns\nPI Controller\nKc\nGain\nb) Calculate analytically the values for Kc and z (for the PI controller) that will give a critically damped\nresponse with a settling time of 0.5 second. (Assume a=Kp=1)\nc) Now implement those gains in SIMULINK and see if it agrees with expectations. If there is any\ndiscrepancy, please explain it.\nd) Now add the feedback filter H(s) to the SIMULINK diagram. Assume that Kf = 1 and that the filter time\nconstant (Wf = 0.5 sec). Without changing Kc or z, run the simulation again, and plot the result. What\nhappened and why?\ne) Now go ahead and vary the gain Kc until you get critically damped response again as seen by the\nsimulation response. (Try to keep track of how many simulations you have to do until you get the \"right\"\nanswer.) What is the settling time for this case?\nFigure 15.3.2:\n\n15.4\nWackygraph\nYour instructor has written a small Matlab m-file called wackygraph.m which he claims makes\ninteresting plots.

It is observed that,after an initial starting transient,\nthe steady-state rotor speed ωss is the same, whether a CD is mounted or not. The start-up\ntransients are, however, different. With no disc mounted, the rotor spindle-speed reaches\n95% ofωss in 0.30 seconds, but when a disc is mounted it takes 2.0 seconds toreach that same\nspeed.

Again, for simplicity, consider the limiting case where all friction is absent. Take\nthe mass of the textbook to be one half the mass of the plate, and assume that during the motion\nthe textbook remains in contact with the plate. There are two cases to be considered. In Case I\nthere is a \"zero height drop\"in which the book is released from rest when just in contact with the\nplate. In Case II the drop is from a non-zero height such that the book strikes the motionless plate\nwith a downward velocity of vo.

The problem is inten\ntionally open-ended; we haven't told you what methods to use to find the requested information.\nThink physically about the problem, and develop the simplest methods which will allow you to\nanswer the questions which we pose with reasonable accuracy. In your answers, we expect you to\nprovide a good description of the experiments you conducted and the assumptions made in devel\noping answers. Relevant and clear sketches, figures, and experimental data clearly presented will\ngreatly help in telling us what you did. We will come back to this problem over the course of the\nnext few weeks, so please retain copies of your data and calculations for later reference. We will\nnot provide solutions for this problem, so it is up to you to develop a solid understanding now so\nthat you will be able to effectively answer later modeling questions.\nYou are welcome to work in groups of your own creation for solving the experimental parts of this\nproblem. However, it is up to you to be sure whatever collaboration you undertake is effective\nfor increasing your own learning. The mousetraps are yours to keep, so feel free to drill holes, tie\non strings, etc., if that will facilitate your experiments. Just be sure that your trap can remain\nfunctional. If you are working in a group, you can take one of your traps completely apart if that\nhelps. We recommend putting some super glue on the two staples in the base where these enter the\nbase in order to glue them into the base. Otherwise the staples have a tendency to pull out in about\n20-30 triggers of the trap. Safety note: Parts of the trap attain significant velocities when\nthe trap is triggered.Thus, you must wear the provided safety glasses at all times when\nyou are conducting experiments on the trap! Your vision is a precious commodity!\nPlease return the safety glasses to us when requested at the close of this experiment.\nTo have a common vocabulary, we will use the following terminology: The trap is built on a wood\npiece we will call the base. We will refer to the main pivoting wire portion of the trap as the bail.\nThe bail is driven by the main spring wrapped around its pivot point. When cocked, the bail is\nretained by a wire that we will call the trigger bar.The bait is placed on a piece of metal we will call\nthe trigger plate. When cocked, the trigger bar is captured by the trigger plate, and then released\nwhen the trigger plate is touched with sufficient force.Please answer the following questions. Think\ncarefully about how to develop these answers in a accurate,efficient manner. Use fundamentals to\nguide your thinking!\n(a) Define the cross-bar as the portion of the wire bail at the largest radius from the pivot, i.e.,\nthe portion of the wire that hits a pencil when the trap is triggered. What is the force\nacting on the crossbar when the trap is cocked, i.e., how much force is required to keep the\ntrap in the cocked position? What element supplies this force to the cross-bar? How is\nthis force transferred to the base?About what fraction of the force is carried by the trigger\nplate? Include a diagram to explain your thinking.Devise a means to measure this hold-open\nforce to an accuracy on the order of a fraction of a Newton. Tell us how you made your\nmeasurements, and why they should be valid. What provides the weight calibration? Include\nrelevant diagrams and experimental data.\n(b) When the trap is in the closed position (i.e., in its resting state), there is still a torque acting\non the bail. For example, when the cross-bar is resting on a pencil, a force is exerted on the\npencil,forcing it against the base. We will call this the resting-state force. Devise a means to\nmeasure this resting-state force to an accuracy on the order of a fraction of a Newton. Tell us\n\nhow you made your measurements, and why they should be valid. What provides the weight\ncalibration? Include relevant diagrams and experimental data.\n(c) Use the force measurements you made above to develop a model for the spring torque as a\nfunction of opening angle, under the assumption that the force, and thus the torque, varies\nlinearly with opening angle. As a convention, assume that the resting-state angle is0 radians,\nand thus that the hold-open angle (i.e., when the trap is cocked) is π radians. Express your\ntorque model in units of Nm/rad. What is the angle at which zero torque is exerted (it's not\n0 rad,since there is still a significant torque at this angle)? Make a sketch of the torque as a\nfunction of angle.\n(d) On the course web site there are several high-speed videos which show the trap being triggered.\nThe video labeled mtrap1 shows a pencil triggering the trap. The frame rate of this video is\n1000frames/sec. On the basis of your observation of the video, about how long does it take\nfor the trap to close after it is triggered? What is approximately the highest velocity in m/sec\nattained by any part of the trap? About how fast is the cross-bar going in m/sec when it hits\nthe base after being triggered?Explain how you developed these estimates. To give a sense of\nscale, an arrow shot from a modern bow goes about 100 m/sec, and a bullet from a rifle goes\nabout 1000 m/sec.\n\n16.15\nMousetrap Dynamics 2\nThis problem further considers the mousetrap system. Now we develop a model which will predict\nthe closing time of the trap.\n(a) From the geometry of the bail, and using the density of steel of about 8 × 103/m3, calculate\nthe moment of inertia of the bail about the pivot point, in units of kg-m2 .\n(b) Last week you measured the force of the bail in the open and closed positions, and thereby\ndeveloped a model of the torque acting on the bail as a function of angle. For the rest of\nthis week's problem, we will assume that the torque does not vary as a function of angle, but\nrather has a constant value equal to the open position torque. This will allow us to simplify\nthe analytical calculation of the trap closing time. What is the value of this constant torque\nin N-m?\n(c) Use the simplified constant spring torque model developed above as part of an analysis which\nwill predict the time required for the trap to close when triggered. Clearly describe your\nthinking in developing this model. Please provide plots of the angular velocity and position\nas a function of time as well as the magnitude of the velocity of the cross-bar as a function of\ntime. What is the velocity of the cross-bar when it reaches the closed position (θ = 0)? How\nlong does it take the trap to close from when it is triggered?\n(d) Compare your predicted transition time and velocity with data that you extract from the\nhigh-speed video which we have placed on the web. Tell us how you made this comparison.\nHow might your model need to be modified in order to match the measured data on the\nvideo?\n\n16.16\nMousetrap Dynamics 3\nThis problem revisits the continuing saga of mousetrap dynamics. In our last exciting installment,\nyou calculated the time to close under the assumption that the torque is constant with angle. This\nallowed a fairly simple analysis to predict the closing time with reasonable accuracy. This week,\nwe will allow the torque on the bail to vary linearly with angle. With this linear variation, and\nassuming no damping, the mousetrap is really a second-order oscillator, with a pair of poles on\nthe imaginary axis during the time that the bail is closing. Nonlinearity manifests itself in a very\nstrong fashion when the bail hits the wood part of the trap. However, the closing motion can be\nwell-predicted by this linear model. Specifically, we ask you to:\n(a) Recall your earlier results to write a model for the spring torque as a function of angle in the\nform\nτ = K(θ + θ0).\nHere τ is the torque in Nm applied to the bail from an external source, K is the spring\nconstant in Nm/rad, θ is the rotational angle of the mousetrap, and θ = -θ0 is the angle at\nwhich the torque applied to the bail is zero.\n(b) Use this spring model along with the value of moment of inertia that you computed last week\nto write an undamped second-order differential equation describing the mousetrap motion in\nthe form\nJθ = K(θ + θ0).\nIn the open position, we have defined θ = π. From this initial condition, solve for the motion\nassuming that the bail is released at t = 0. Be clear as to how you handle the θ0 term.\nHow long does it take for the bail to reach the closed position θ = 0? You may assume for\nthe purposes of this analysis that the motion comes to an instantaneous stop when the angle\nreaches 0. Solve for and write an expression for the force required to arrest this motion in\nzero time.\n(c) Use Matlab to make a plot of θ(t) during the closing event based upon your solution above.\nAlso plot on the same axes the function θ(t) based upon last week's analysis in which the\ntorque was constant as a function of angle. How do these two solutions differ? Why?\n(d) Use the high-speed video of the mousetrap to develop a measure of θ(t) for all the frames\nduring the closing event. Overlay this experimental data on your plot from part c). How\ndoes this data differ from the analytical results? Why? How might you refine your analysis\nto better model the event? You do not need to carry out this analysis, just tell us what\nadditional elements or analysis might be added.\n\n16.17\nMousetrap Dynamics 4\nTrigger your mousetrap with a wood pencil, and notice the dent that appears in the pencil. In this\nlast installment of the mousetrap problem, we ask you to develop a calculation which will predict\nthe force experienced by the pencil, and the approximate time-scale in which this force is applied.\n(a) Take a look at the high-speed video on the web of the mousetrap being triggered with a\npencil. On the basis of the 1000 frame per second rate of the video, what can you say about\nan upper bound on the time in which the pencil is dented?\n(b) Observe and estimate the depth of the dent in the pencil. In the simplest of models, we\nmight assume that this dent is made at constant force. Under this assumption, you can\nreadily calculate the force and duration of the denting process. You will need to rely on\nthe values of angular velocity and moment of inertia that you developed earlier. Show your\nassumptions and calculations, and make a graph of your estimated force as a function of time.\nHow does this estimate compare with the upper bound that you established in part a)?\n(c) During the denting process, what is the instantaneous power flow as a function of time?\nThat is, what is the time rate of energy transfer from the kinetic energy of the bail to the\nmechanical deformation of the pencil? Express this result in watts. Also, convert this power\nto units of horsepower. How does this power flow compare to typical devices such as light\nbulbs, lawn mower engines, etc.?\n\n16.18\nHydraulic Elevator Design\nFor buildings of moderate height, passenger elevators are frequently driven by hydraulic actuators.\nSuch elevators also include some form of spring/damper assembly in the bottom of the elevator\nshaft to catch the elevator in the event of a failure in the hydraulic drive or in the elevator control\nsystem. This problem studies an idealized model of the design of this crash stop. Specifically,\nsuppose we model the elevator as a lumped mass m = 2000 kg. This mass (the car) rides in a\nvertical shaft, driven from the bottom by a hydraulic cylinder. At the bottom of the shaft are a\nspring and damper which form the crash stop. Define motion in the vertical direction as x. Assume\nthat at t = 0, with the bottom of the elevator at a height of 10 m above the crash stop, and with\nthe elevator at zero velocity, a valve fails in the hydraulic cylinder. The elevator begins falling\nunder the influence of gravity. During the fall, the oil remaining in the cylinder sprays out of the\nfailed valve, and acts as a damper with a damping coefficient c = 2000 Ns/m.\n(a) Develop a model to predict the motion of the elevator during the fall. Make plots of the\nelevator position and velocity as a function of time during the fall. What is the total force\nexerted on a passenger during the fall? For this purpose, we model the passenger as a rigid\nmass of 100 kg (already included in the total m = 2000 kg).\n(b) After falling 10 m, the bottom of the elevator contacts the crash stop. Your job is to design the\ncrash stop so that the elevator comes to rest in a manner which is safe for the passengers and\nwhich also doesn't use up too much space in the building.Develop a model for the behavior\nof the elevator system after it hits the crash stop. In your model, assume that the damping c\nfrom the oil cylinder is present throughout the motion. You may also assume that the crash\nstop mass is insignificant.Use this model to choose the values of the crash spring kr and\ndamper cr to meet the following specifications:\n(i) The maximum acceleration d2x/dt2 on the car must be less than 20 m/s2 at all times.\n(ii) The maximum deflection of the crash stop is to be minimized.\n(iii) The settling time will be defined as the time from initial contact with the crash stop\nuntil the time that the elevator velocity remains below 0.1 m/sec. The settling time\nshould be made small.\nDevelop a model and analyses which allow you to meet the specifications above. Clearly show\nthe key steps, assumptions, and results. Note that this is a typical design problem in that\nthere is no one right answer, only degrees of goodness in satisfying the specifications. Tell us\nhow you attempted to solve this problem. Be sure to include plots of the car position and\nvelocity as a function of time, the deflection of the crash stop, and the force exerted on a\n100 kg passenger. Also show on your plots the peak acceleration of the car and the time at\nwhich it occurs, the maximum deflection of the crash stop and the associated time, and the\ntime at which the car velocity meets the settling specification.\n\n16.19\nServo Position Control\nFigure 16.19.1:\n\n16.20\nServo Frequency Compensation\nThis problem is a continuation of Problem 16.19.\nFigure 16.20.1:\n\n16.21\nServo Torque Disturbance\nThis problem is a continuation of Problems 16.19 and 16.20.\nNow we encounter a true disturbance: the application of some \"unknown\" and\nundesirable torque on the motor shaft. Our design goal will be to completely reject this\ndisturbance, and to do so we must make use of more complex controller forms.\nFor the moment keep Kp at the value used in Problem 1b), but now assume Tr = 0 and Td\nis a unit step.\na)\nWhat is the disturbance transfer function T\nTd\nfor this system?\nb)\nSketch the expected response to the step in Td based on this transfer function..\nc)\nWhat will be the steady-state error to this disturbance?\nNow, to completely eliminate this error, we'll try an integral controller of the form\nGc= Kp/s.\nWith this new controller:\nd)\nExplain why this controller form will not yield an acceptable control system by\nreference to the bode plot for this new system.\nAs a remedy to this problem, we could replace the integral controller with a proportional\nintegral (PI) controller of the form:\nGc(s) = Kp KIs\nthat can be re-written as:\n\nGc(s) = Kc(s D)\ns\nFigure 16.21.1:\n\n16.22\nPlate On Springs Damped 1\nm\nyk\nkc\nkc\nbc\nbc\nf(t)\nFigure 16.22.1: Plate On Springs With Damper\nConsider the vertical oscillations of a 5-pound steel plate supported on springs, as demonstrated\nin class (Fig. 16.22.1). Begin by formulating a simple linear model for the motion of the plate in\nresponse to an applied force f(t). Your job is to use the MATLAB scriptsMassSprgDmpr1, 2 &\n3 based on closed form analytical solutions, of the type developed in class, to obtain twelve plots\nof the time history of response for twelve different sets of model parameters. In every case the\nplate is at rest in its equilibrium position, when, att = 0 a constant force of 5 pounds is suddenly\napplied in the direction of positive displacement. In each case you must select the model stiffness\nand damping parameters to achieve the specified behavioral parameter values.\n(a) In each of the first four plots the undamped natural frequency is 5 Hz(cycles/second), and\nthe damping ratios have the following values: (i) ζ = 0.1; (ii)ζ = 0.5; (iii) ζ = 1.0; (iv)\nζ = 1.5. You must choose the model parameters to insert in the MATLAB scripts to get\nthe time histories of response corresponding to these combinations of ωo and ζ. The script\n'MassSprgDmpr1.m' must be used for Cases(i) and (ii). The script 'MassSprgDmpr2.m' must\nbe used for Case (iii), and the script 'MassSprgDmpr3.m' must be used for Case (iv). For\nCases (i), (ii), and (iii) take the total duration of the time history to be equal to 5 times the\ndecay time constant. In Case(iv) take the total duration of the time history to be 5 times the\nlongest time constant.\n\n0.5\n1.5\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\nCase (i)\nTime [seconds]\nDisplacement [meters]\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.01\n0.012\nCase (ii)\nTime [seconds]\nDisplacement [meters]\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.01\nCase (iii)\nTime [seconds]\nDisplacement [meters]\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.01\nCase (iv)\nTime [seconds]\nDisplacement [meters]\nFigure 16.22.2: Figure 1\n\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.5\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.01\n0.012\n0.014\n0.016\n0.018\nTime History of Displacement Response\nTime [seconds]\nDisplacement [meters]\nCase (i)\nCase (ii)\nCase (iii)\nCase (iv)\nFigure 16.22.3: Figure 2\n(b) In each of the next four plots, the damped natural frequency is 5 Hz, and the damping ratios\nhave the following values: (i) ζ = 0.1; (ii)ζ = 0.3; (iii) ζ = 0.5; (iv) ζ = 0.7.

For Δ = 10-6 , ts = 13.82τ.\n\n1.3\nFirst Order System Response\nFigure 1.3.1:\n\nFigure 1.3.2:\n\n2nd Order Systems\n2.1\nSecond-Order System Response\nFigure 2.1.1:\n\nFigure 2.1.2:\n\nFigure 2.1.3:\n\nFigure 2.1.4:\n\nFigure 2.1.5:\n\nFigure 2.1.6:\n\np\n2.2\nSecond Order Responses\n(a) From the figures in the problem set, it can be estimated that the period T = 0.1sec and the\ntime constant τ = 0.35 sec. ωd = 2π/T = 62.8. Since the system is slightly damped, the\nestimated damping ratio\nζ = τωn\n≈ τωd\n= 0.35 × 63 = 0.045\n(1)\nFurther the natural frequency ωn = ωd/ 1 - ζ2 = 62.8\n(b) A mechanical mass-spring-damper system will give this response.

Thus the system does not have\nan oscillation. Because all the terms are first order, the system will not overshoot the final\nvalue.\nCase B - This is a summation of 2 first order response and a decaying sinusoid. Since the\ndecay constant of the sinusoid is faster than the slower first order terms, the sinusoid will\nappear in the initial response but decay to a simple first order response. Depending on the\nmagnitude of the sinusoid it is possible for the system to overshoot.\nCase C - This is the summation of two decaying sinusoids. Since the time constant of the\ndecay envelope of the 4.33 r/s sinusoid is faster than the 9.95 r/s sinusoid, the response will\ninitially be a combination of the two sinusoids decaying to just the 9.95 r/s sinusoid. This\nsystem can overshoot the final value.\n(c) To sketch the responses for each of these systems, we need to make a couple of assumptions.\nOne assumption I made was that all of the coefficients were equal to 1 (Reasonable for this\n\n...\ncase). The 2nd assumption I made was that φn = 0. Figures 3.2.1-3.2.3 show the responses\nfor the three cases. The left plot shows the individual components, while the right plot shows\nthe total response (x1 +x2...+xn). Normally, we are interested in the system response to a set\nof initial conditions or an input force, in which case the φn = 0 and c1 = c2.... For reference,\nI have included the system response for the initial conditions x(0) = 1, x(0) = x (0) =x (0)\n(Note: the number of initial conditions for the system is equal to the order of the system thus\na first order system needs one initial condition, a 2nd order system needs 2 IC, ect.).

Consider only vertical motion of the balloon. Let the length of the string between the\nballoon and the floor be y. Assume the string has mass/unit length ρ so that a string mass of ρy\nmust move whenever the balloon moves. Both the balloon mass and the string mass experience\ngravitational attraction pulling them down. Assume that there is no tension in the string at the\npoint where the string meets the floor. Finally assume there are damping mechanisms ( air drag and\nlosses associated with coiling and uncoiling the string on the floor) which can be approximately\nmodeled by a linear damping force fd = bdy/dt opposing the velocity dy/dyt. These forces are\ndisplayed in the free body diagram in Fig. 4.1.1.\ny\nB\nmg\nρyg\nm\nfd\nFigure 4.1.1: Free-Body Diagram of Hovering Balloon\nTo construct a model we consider (i) geometric compatibility requirements, (ii) constitutive equa\ntions, and (iii) force-balance requirements.\n(i) The displacement of the balloon is y(t). The velocity and acceleration are\ndy\ndv\nd2y\nv =\na =\n=\ndt\ndt\ndt2\n(ii) The constitutive equations are\nd\nfm =\n[(m + ρy)v]\nfd = bv\nfgravity = (m + ρy)g\ndt\n\n(iii) The force-balance requirement is\nfm = B - fgravity - fd\nAn equation of motion for the model is obtained by substituting the constitutive equations into the\nforce-balance requirement to get\nd\ndy\n[(m + ρy)v] + b\n+ (m + ρy)g = B\n(1)\ndt\ndt\n(a) In a steady state y has a fixed value yo and all time derivatives. When we set the time\nderivatives equal to zero in (1) we find that the equation is satisfied if\nB - mg\ny = yo =\nρg\nThe variable mass term in (1) makes the equation nonlinear. It can be approximated by\na linear equation if the varying mass of the string, ρy is replaced by the fixed mass ρyo of\nthe string in its equilibrium position. This is a reasonable approximation for studying small\noscillations about the equilibrium position. The dynamics of such oscillations are clarified if\nwe introduce the displacement z = y - yo of the balloon from its equilibrium position. After\ninserting y = yo + z in (1) we find\ndv\ndz\n(m + ρyo)\n+ b\n+ ρgz = B - (m + ρyo)g = 0\ndt\ndt\nFinally, introducing the total mass M = m + ρyo and putting v = dy/dt = dz/dt, we obtain\nd2z\ndz\nM\n+ b\n+ ρgz = 0\n(2)\ndt2\ndt\nThis is the standard form for free oscillation of a linear second-order system.\n(b) Physically, when the balloon rises above its equilibrium position it lifts additional string whose\nweight tends to lower the balloon, and when the balloon descends below its equilibrium\nposition it carries a lighter load of string which tends to drive the balloon upward. The\nequivalent stiffness in the equation of motion (2) is k = ρg. This is the weight per unit length\nof the string. This example illustrates the fact that restoring-force elements do not always\nlook like springs.\n(c) The second-order equation of motion (2) predicts oscillation if the damping is light enough\nto produce a critical damping factor ζ smaller than unity.\n(d) A free vibration governed by (2) will eventually decay to zero if there is a positive damping\nparameter b.\nTo obtain the behavioral parameters ζ and ωo we use the equations\nζ2 =\nLDR2\nand\nωo = p ωd\n,\nwith\nωd = 2π\nπ2 + LDR2\n1 - ζ2\nTd\n\n(e) From the given data we see that the ratio of successive peak amplitudes is 0.2. Thus the LDR\nis ln(0.2) = -1.609, and the damping ratio is\n(1.609)2\n1/2\nζ =\n= 0.456\nπ2 + (1.609)2\n(f) From the given data we see that the damped natural period Td is 3.0 seconds, so that the\ndamped natural frquency is ωd = 2π/Td = 2.094 rad/sec, and\n2.094\nωo = p\n= 2.35 rad/sec\n1 - (0.456)2\nTo obtain the model parameters, we begin with the effective stiffness k which is the weight per\nunit length of the string. This is given as 0.5 ounces per foot which is 0.03125 pounds/foot in the\nEnglish system or\n4.448\nk = 0.03125\n= 0.456 Newtons/meter\n· 0.3048\n(g) The effective mass M of the balloon plus the equilibrium length of string, is given by\nk\n0.456\nM =\n=\n= 0.0826 kg\nωo 2\n(2.35)2\nin the SI system. In the English system\nW\nW\n0.03125\nM =\n=\n=\n= 0.00566 pound sec2/ft\ng\n32.2\n(2.35)2\nfrom which we find W = 0.1823 pounds or 2.92 ounces. The weight of 3 feet of string is 1.5\nounces so the weight of the balloon is 1.42 ounces. In the SI system, the mass of 3 feet of\nstring is 3(0.3048)(0.456)/9.81 = 0.0425 kg, so the mass of the balloon is m = 0.0826 - 0.0425\n=0.0401 kg.\n(h) The effective damping coefficient b = 2ζωoM is\nb = 2(0.456)(2.35)(0.0826) = 0.1770 N/m/s\nin SI units, or\nb = 2(0.456)(2.35)(0.00566) = 0.0121 pounds/ft/sec\n(i) The effective stiffness was previously obtained as 0.456 Newtons/meter in SI units or 0.03125\npounds/foot in English units.\n\nr\ns\ns\n4.2\nBungee Jumper\nInitially the bungee jumper free-falls under the influence of gravity and air resistance, then when\nthe slack is taken up in the elastic cord, the cord exerts an increasing retarding force which reduces\nher velocity to zero at level A, after which she bobs up and down with decreasing amplitude until\nshe comes to rest at the equilibrium position at level B. For the purposes of a preliminary estimate\nof the conditions up to instant at which level A is reached, neglect the effects of air resistance and\ndamping in the cord. Under this assumption energy is conserved. In the first jump the equilibrium\nposition B is 20 feet below the point where the cord begins to stretch. The stiffness of the cord is\nthen estimated as\nW\nk =\n=\n= 7.5 pounds/foot\nΔ\nThe undamped natural frequency of the mass-spring system consisting of the jumper and cord is\nk\nk\n7.5\nωo =\n=\n=\n= 1.269 rad/sec\nm\nW/g\n150/32.2\nLet the elevation of the upper attachment point of the cord be denoted by ho, the elevation of the\npoint where the slack is taken up and the cord begins to stretch be denoted by h1, the elevation\nof the equilibrium point B be denoted by hB, and the elevation of the point A where the jumper's\nvelocity first vanishes be denoted by hA.\n(a) In the first jump, ho - h1 = 100 feet, and ho - hB = 120 feet. The level A can be located by\nequating the potential energy lost in the fall to the elastic energy in the cord.\nW (ho - hA) = kΔ(ho - hA) = k(h1 - hA)2 = k[(ho - hA) - 100]2\nThis reduces to a quadratic equation for (ho - hA) whose solutions are\n(ho - hA) = 120 ± 66.3 feet\nThe physically significant root is (ho - hA) = 186.3 feet. The low point A is 66.3 feet below\nthe equilibrium level B, or 186.3 feet below the upper attachment point.\n(b) The maximum downward acceleration is 32.2 feet/sec2 during the initial free fall.\n(c) The maximum upward acceleration occurs at point A and is\namax = (Max displacement from equilibrium)ωo\n2 = (66.3)(1.269)2 = 106.8ft/sec2\nwhich is 3.32 times the acceleration of gravity.\n(d) The primary assumption made is that dissipation of energy has been neglected. The cord has\nbeen assumed to behave like a linear spring.\n(e) In the second jump the slack length is doubled which cuts the stiffness in half, and doubles\nthe distance Δ to 40 feet. The natural frequency is reduced to 0.897 rad/sec. The location of\nthe new low point A' is obtained by solving a similar quadratic equation with the new values\nof h0 - h1 = 200 feet, ho - hB0 = 240 feet, and Δ = 40 feet. The result is\n(ho - hA0 ) = 240 ± 132.7 feet\nThe physically significant root is (ho - hA) = 373 feet. The low point A is 132.7 feet below\nthe equilibrium level B', or 373 feet below the upper attachment point.\n\n(f) The level of the equilibrium point B' is 240 feet below the attachment point.\n(g) The maximum downward acceleration is still 32,2 feet/sec\n(h) The maximum upward acceleration is\namax = (Max displacement from equilibrium)ωo\n2 = (132.7)(0.897)2 = 106.8ft/sec2\nAlthough the jump involves a longer free fall and a greater extension of the cord the maximum\nacceleration does not change!\nBungee Jumps\nTime [seconds]\nElevation [feet]\nLevel B\nLevel A\nLevel B1\nLevel A1\nFigure 4.2.1: Time Histories of Bungee Jumps\n(i) The time histories of the two jumps are shown in Fig. 4.2.1. For plotting purposes the\nelevation of the upper attachment point was (arbitrarily) assigned the value 400 feet. The\ntrajectory of free fall is indicated by the dashed-line parabola. With 100 feet of slack the\njumper's trajectory departs from the free-fall parabola at h = 300 ft and begins to oscillate\nabout the final equilibrium level B. With no damping the maximum excursion (and maximum\nacceleration) is at Level A. With 200 feet of slack the jumper's trajectory departs from the\nfree-fall parabola at h = 200 ft and begins to oscillate about the final equilibrium level B1.\nWith no damping the maximum excursion (and maximum acceleration) is at Level A1.\n\n4.3\nElevator Model\nConsider a free-body diagram of the elevator of mass m when it is accelerating upward with accel\neration dv/dt. The equation of motion is\ndv\nT - mg = m dt\nT\nT\nm\nv\nT\nmg\nO\n3 ft/sec\n1 sec\nTime\nVelocity\nFigure 4.3.1: Elevator Dynamics\nWhen the elevator is at rest, or traveling at constant velocity (dv/dt = 0), the tension T in the\ncable (and the load on the winch) would be simply the weight mg of the elevator and its cargo.\nDesigning the winch structure on the basis of this load would be static design. Including the\ndynamic effect of accelerating the elevator results in T = mg + mdv/dt. To answer the question\nof whether dynamics matters, one must compare the magnitudes of the static load mg and the\ndynamic load mg + mdv/dt. The problem statement does not specify the explicit time behavior\nof dv/dt. It merely states that a total change of velocity of 3 feet/second is accomplished in one\nsecond. The sketch above shows two possible velocity histories. The slope of the velocity history is\nthe acceleration dv/dt. With the dashed history the acceleration is uniform and has the magnitude\ndv = 3ft/sec = (3)(0.3048) = 0.914m/sec2\ndt\n1sec\nThis time history has the smallest maximum acceleration but the sharp corners at the beginning\nand end of the one second acceleration are hard on the winch motor and are felt as jerks by\n\nthe passengers. The time history suggested by the solid curve in the figure produces a smoother\ntransition at the expense of a larger maximum acceleration. If the system is designed to accelerate\naccording to the solid curve the maximum acceleration can be 50% to 100% larger than the uniform\nacceleration of the dashed history. In the latter case the ratio of the dynamic load to the static\nload would be\ng + (dv/dt)max\n9.81 + 2(0.914)\n=\n= 1.186\ng\n9.81\nHere, dynamics does indeed matter! The dynamic load is 18.6% larger than the static load.\nEngineers often make preliminary design calculations to determine ball-park estimates of size,\nweight, and power. In these 'back-of-the-envelope' calculations it is common to omit effects with\ncontributions of the order of five to ten percent. However, these effects must be included in final\ndesign calculations, which have to be defended in safety investigations.\n\n4.4\nHoisting for Engineers\nThe solution for this problem is not available.\n\nr\nr\n4.5\nBlocked Springs\nLet the effective combined stiffness of the four unblocked springs be ku, and let the effective com\nbined stiffness of the four blocked springs be kb. In both cases the vehicle weight mg is supported\nby the springs. Since only half of the spring is active in the blocked case the static deflection\nΔb = mg/kb in the blocked case will be half the static deflection Δu = mg/ku in the unblocked\ncase. Since we are given that Δu - Δb = 2.5 inches, we deduce that Δu = 5.0 inches, and Δb = 2.5\ninches.\n(a) The effective stiffnesses are\nku =\n= 500 pounds/inch\nand\nkb =\n= 1000 pounds/inch\n2.5\nin British units.

The effective\ndamping coefficient is\nb = 2ζu(ωo)um = 2(1.0)(8.787)(1134) = 19, 930 Newtons/meter/second\n(d) Assuming that the shock absorbers are unchanged by the blocking operation, the damping\ncoefficient remains b = 19, 930 N/m/s and the new value of ζ for the system with blocked\nsprings is\nb\n19, 930\nζb =\n=\n= 0.7071\n2(ωo)bm\n2(12.437)(11340\nIf y is measured vertically upward from the equilibrium position, and v = dy/dt, the constitutive\nequations are\ndv\nfm = m\n,\nfd = bv,\nand\nfk = ky\ndt\nwith appropriate subscripts u and b for the unblocked and blocked cases, respectively. and the\nforce-balance requirement is\nfm = f(t) - fd - fk\nwhere f(t) is the upward driving force applied to the vehicle.

Furthermore we assume that the cable is flexible\n(it bends easily) but stretches very little in comparison with the extension of the spring. Let x\nbe the horizontal displacement of the pulley attached to the end of the spring, and let y be the\nvertical displacement of the door, both measured from the equilibrium position of the door hanging\nfreely under the influence of gravity. In the equilibrium position, the tension To in the cables must\nequal the weight mg of the door. The total force in the spring is 2To which has produced an initial\nextension Δ of the springs, where Δ = 2To/k = 2mg/k.\nIn a small oscillation about the equilibrium position, the displacements x(t) and y(t) oscillate\nabout zero and the tension in the cable oscillates about the initial tension To = mg. When the\ncable remains taut, the displacements x and y are linked by the geometric compatibility requirement\ny = 2x. This is the crucial insight for this system, and it is not immediately obvious to all. One\nway to see it is to imagine that the door and the cables are temporarily frozen in position while the\npulley attached to the spring is displaced a distance x to the left. An empty loop of cable appears,\nto the right of the pulley, with a straight length x in the upper cable and a straight length x in the\nlower cable. Now with the pulley fixed, gradually lower the door to take up the slack in the empty\nloop. It will be necessary to lower the door a distance y = 2x to make the cable taut again.\n(a) To formulate a model to analyze the door oscillations we need to assemble the geometric\ncompatibility requirements, the constitutive equations, and the force balance requirements.\n\ns\nThe geometric compatibility requirement is\ny = 2x\nThe constitutive equations for the door and the spring are\nm d2y\nfm =\nand\n2T = k(Δ + x) = 2mg + kx\n2 dt2\nand the force balance requirement is\nfm = mg - T\nThese relations constitute a mathematical model of the garage door system. They can be\norganized into a single differential equation for either x or y by inserting the constitutive\nequations for fm and T in the force balance equation and using the compatibility requirement\nto eliminate x in favor of y, or vice versa. The result is either\nd2y\nk\nd2x\nk\nm\n+ y = 0\nor\nm\n+ x = 0\ndt2\ndt2\nNote that because the origins for the displacements x and y were established at the equilibrium\nposition, the gravity force has canceled out of the equations of motion.\n(b) The undamped natural frequency ωo for the preceding equations is given by\nω2\nk\nkg\n=\n=\no\n2m\n2W\nwhere W is the weight of the door and g = 386 in/sec2 is the acceleration of gravity. The\nfrequency of oscillation fo in Hz is\nωo\n(5)(386)\nfo =\n=\n= 0.350 Hz\n2π\n2π\n2(200)\n(c) It is assumed that the door only moves vertically in the small oscillation. The inertia of the\npulleys, cable, and spring is neglected. The elasticity of the cable in tension is neglected, and\nit is assumed that the tension T is uniform throughout the length of the cable.\n\n4.8\nRotating Damped\nA rotor with moment of inertia I and angular velocity ω is subjected to an accelerating torque T\nand two retarding friction torques, each modeled linearly as Bω.\n(a) The equation of motion is\ndω\ndω\n2B\nI\n+ 2Bω = T\nor\n= -\nω + T\n(1)\ndt\ndt\nI\nI\n(b) The steady-state angular velocity, when T = 10 Newton-meters, and I = 0.001 kg-m2, and\nB = 0.005 N-m/r/s is\nT\nωss =\n=\n= 1000 r/s\n2B\n2(0.005)\n(c) Consider the input T = Ta sin Ωt to be the imaginary part of the complex input Taexp(iΩt)\nand look for a complex solution of the form ω = Aexp(iΩt).

The mass m of\nthe vehicle is (2000 pounds)(0.4536 kg/pound) = 907.2 kg and the vehicle speed at impact vo is (10\nmi/hr)(5280 ft/mi)(0.3048 meters/ft)/(3600 secs/hr) = 4.470 meters/sec. When there is no energy\ndissipation (b = 0) the displacement of the mass goes through a half-cycle of undamped vibration\nof the form\nx(t) = A sin ωot\nThe vehicle then retreats from the barrier with velocity -vo. The amplitude A of the oscillation\nis given as 6 inches which is (6 in)(0.0254 meters/in) = 0.1524 meters, but the undamped natural\nfrquency ωo is unknown.\nm\nk\nb\nvo\nFigure 4.11.1: Model of Vehicle Impacting a Barrier\nOne way to calculate ωo is to set the velocity obtained by differentiating x(t) equal to vo at t = 0.\nThis leads to\nvo\n4.470\nωo =\n=\n= 29.33 rad/sec\nA\n0.1524\nAnother way to obtain ωo is to use conservation of energy,\nKE = 1 mv 2 = 1 kA2\no\nto get k, and then use ωo\n2 = k/m to evaluate ωo.\n(a) If the value of ωo is already known, then the effective stiffness k is obtained from\nk = mωo\n2 = (907.2)(29.33)2 = 780, 400 N/m\nIf ωo is not available, then the stiffness can be obtained directly from conservation of energy.\n\n4.470 2\nk = m\nvo\n= 907.2\n= 780, 500 N/m\nA\n0.1524\n(b) During the half-cycle of undamped sinusoidal motion x(t) = A sin ωot the acceleration is\nd2x/dt2 = -Aω2 sin ωot.

In the undamped case, this period was a half cycle of sinusoidal oscillation.\nIn the damped cases, the model results are valid only as long as the barrier force is compressive.\nIf tension is required the fender separates from the barrier. For the case ζ = 0.5 we see that\nthe model predicts tensile barrier force after t = 0.082 seconds. In all four cases there is\nseparation of the vehicle from the barrier after the impact.\n(h) Peak decelerations are proportional to peak barrier forces (this is a consequence of Newton's\nlaw F = ma). In the undamped case, the barrier force is delivered by the spring. Its\nmagnitude is fbarr,u = mAωo\n2 = mvoωo. In the damped case, the barrier force is delivered by\nboth the spring and the damper. At the initial instant of impact, when the fender begins to\nmove with velocity vo, but hasn't yet deflected the spring, the entire barrier force is delivered\nby the damper. Its magnitude is fbarr,d = bvo which can be made as large as desired by\nincreasing the parameter b. This initial damping force will be the same as the peak undamped\nforce if bvo = mvoωo. This occurs when ζ = 0.5.\n(i) The peak deceleration is greatest in Case (f), ζ = 1.0.\n\n(j) By trial and error with 'crashworthinesssol.m' one finds that 'decel' has a fairly flat minimum\nvalue of slightly more than 106 meters/second2 over the range 0.25 < ζ < 0.30.\ncrashworthinesssol.m\nDownload\n% crashworthinesssol.m MATLAB Script adapted from pos.m which was\n% MATLAB script for Problem 3 in 2.003 Assignment 5.

Here we know that peak response occurs when the engine speed is 2200 rpm. The\ncorresponding forcing frequency is Ω/2 = 1100 rpm or 115.2 rad/sec. We do not know the\nzero-frequency response, but we do know that the ratio of the peak response, at 2200 rpm, to\nthe response at 500 rpm is 4. We also know from Fig.2 that the response magnitude for low\nfrequencies, well below the natural frequency, is not much greater than the zero-frequency\nresponse. Therefor we can take the given ratio of 4 as an estimate of the ratio |Z|peak.

Under these assumptions the theory developed in class can be used\nto estimate the effective mass M of the back of the truck from the observed frequency of oscillation\nand static deflection.\n(a) The statement that the oscillation contained more than five clearly defined cycles is a tip-off\nthat the system is lightly damped, which suggests that damping might be neglected in making\na preliminary estimate.

As can be seen, the inertia has two torques acting on it:\nT1 generated by the damper c1 between the input and the inertia and T2 generated by the\ndamper c2 between the inertia and ground. The schematic drawing is helpful but not required\nin the solution.\n(b) Using the FBD from part a, we can write the following relationship:\nΣT = JΩ 2 = T1 + T2\nThis is where the schematic becomes helpful. By inspection, we can work out the following\nrelationships\nT1 = c1(Ω1 - Ω2)\nT2 = -c2Ω2\nSubstituting for T1 and T2 yields the following\nJΩ 2 = c1(Ω1 - Ω2) - c2Ω2 ⇒ JΩ 2 + (c1 + c2)Ω2 = c1Ω1\n\n(c) The input to the system has been defined as Ω1(t) = us(t) thus the differential equation for\nthis system become\nJΩ 2 + (c1 + c2)Ω2 = c1us(t)\nThis differential equation (DE) matches that for a first order forced response.

Since, the torques on either side of the damper need to be equal,\nwe know the torque acting on the shaft is equal and opposite to T1. Since the system is in\nsteady state, we know that the velocity of the shaft is constant which means that the sum of\ntorques acting on the shaft equal 0.\nΣTshaft = 0 = Tin - T1 ⇒ Tin = T1\nWe know that\nT1 = c1(Ω1 - Ω2)\nΩ1 = us(t) = 1\nΩ2 =\nΩss =\nc1\nc1 + c2\nThus T1 = c1 1 - c1\nc\n+\nc2\n= c1\nc1\n+\nc2\nc2\nMore generally T1 =\nc1c2 Ω1\nc1 + c2\n\n6.2\nFluid Leak\nThe solution for this problem is not available.\n\n6.3\nWhere'd the water go?\n(a) Use the parameters R = 1.5 109 [Pa sec/m3], and L = 7 106 [Pa sec2/m3].

We need a differential equation in terms of\nthe nozzle flow. Note that the capacitance in this circuit can be neglected as it is effectively\nshort-circuited by the shower nozzle. Write out the loop equation for this circuit:\nPs(t) = PR + PL\nUse the constitutive relationships for the fluidic resistor and fluid inertance:\nPR = qRR\ndqL\nPL = L dt\nnote that qR = qL = qn. Substitute these equations back into the loop equation:\nPs(t) = qRR + LdqL\ndt\nL dqL\nPs(t) = qR +\nR\nR dt\nthe solution to this standard first order differential equation takes the form\nqn(t) = Ae-t/τ + B where τ = L\nR\nOur initial condition is that Ps(0) = 3 105 [Pa].

A\ndiagram depicting the idealized block outside of the oven is shown in Figure 7.1.1.\nTamb\nTblock\n\nc=385 J/(kgoC)\nm=0.1 kg\nq\nFigure 7.1.1: Diagram of copper block out of oven.\nThe ambient temperature surrounding the block is given as Tamb, the internal temperature of the\nblock is given as Tblock, and the heat flow from the block to the environment is given as q. The\nspecific heat of copper (c) is given as 385 kg\nJ\noC , and the mass of the block is 0.1 kg.\nThe energy associated with the change of the block's temperature is given by\nCΔTblock\n(1)\nwhere C is the thermal capacitance of the block given by mc. The energy associated with heat\ntransfer for a period of time Δt is given by\nqΔt.\n(2)\nIn this idealized model, the heat loss is balanced exactly by the change in temperature of the block.\nThus, the instantaneous energy/heat balance is given by\nmcdTblock = -qdt.\n(3)\nThe negative sign in front of the q is due to the fact that the heat is flowing out of the block. If\nyou were to form a control volume around the block, heat flowing in would have a positive sign.\nAccording to the way the picture is drawn, the heat flow, q, is flowing outwards. In addition,\nthe heat flow, q, will be modeled as linearly proportional to the difference between the block\ntemperature and ambient temperature as\nq = Tblock - Tamb\n(4)\nR\nwhere R is the thermal resistance between the block and the environment. By substitution we have\nmcdTblock = qdt\n(5)\n= - Tblock - Tamb\nR\ndt\n(6)\n\nTherefore, the governing equation is\nRC dTblock + Tblock = Tamb\n(7)\ndt\nwhere the time constant, τ, for the system is given by RC.\ntime (s)\nTblock(K)\nTamb\nFigure 7.1.2: The block temperature (Tblock) is plotted against time (t). The ambient temperature\nis given by Tamb.\nGoing back to Figure 7.1.2 we can calculate the time constant by estimating the amount of time\nrequired for the block to decay by 63% of the difference between the initial block temperature and\nthe ambient temperature. This occurs at approximately 559 K after a time interval of 600 seconds.\nTherefore, the time constant for the system is 600 seconds. With τ = RC and C=38.5 oJ\nC , the\noC\nthermal resistance, R, equals 15.6 J/s .\n\n7.2\nThe Hot Copper Block 1\n(a) First, draw a diagram which shows heat flow through the system.

We know that Tw(0) =\nTb(0) = Ta = 25*C.

We need the constitutive relationships for the devices:\nTd - Tc = 50 Rdc\n·\nTc - Ts = 50 Rcs\n·\nTs - Ta = 50 Rsa\n·\nrearranging these equations and plugging in the numerical values leads to\nTs = Ta + 50 Rsa = 50*C\n·\nTc = Ts + 50 Rcs = 60*C\n·\nTd = Tc + 50 Rdc = 65*C\n·\n(b) Now draw another picture with the thermal capacitance of the heat sink added in. This new\ncircuit equivalent is shown in Figure 7.4.2.\nqin(t)\nTd(t)\nTc(t)\nTs(t)\nTa(t)\nRdc\nRcs\nRsa\nCs\nFigure 7.4.2: Transistor thermal Equivalent circuit with heatsink thermal capacitance\n\nWhy is the thermal capacitance in parallel with it's associated resistance? Imagine if they\nwere in series. At steady state, there is no heat flow through the capacitance. If they\nwere connected in series, there would be an open circuit with no heat flow, which would be\nimpossible for this thermal system. The thermal capacitance is simply the specific heat times\nthe mass: Cs = 0.90 500 = 450 [J/*C] (remember that *C = *K as far as magnitude is\n·\nconcerned). The constitutive relation for the thermal capacitance is\nq = Cs\ndTs - dTa = Cs\ndTs\ndt\ndt\nWrite out the node equation at Ts\nqin = Cs\ndTs + Ts - Ta\ndt\nRsa\ndTs\nRsaCs\n+ Ts = Rsaqin + Ta\ndt\nThis first order differential equation is the governing equation for the system. The general\nsolution to this equation is\nTs(t) = Ae-t/τ + B where τ = RsaCs\nFirst solve for the time 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. During this time, qin = 500 [W]. The initial and final\nconditions for this time frame are\nTs(0) = 50*C\nTs(inf) = Ta + 500 Rsa = 275*C\n·\nThese conditions yield A = -225 and B = 275. The solution is\nTs(t) = -225e-t/225 + 275\nPlug this solution into the constitutive relationships for the other devices to obtain other\nequations:\nTc(t) = Ts(t) + 500 Rcs = -225e-t/225 + 375\n·\nTd(t) = Tc(t) + 500 Rdc = -225e-t/225 + 425\n·\nNow, there is something to note here. These equations don't match the initial conditions of\ntheir respective steady state values. That is to say, these temperatures seem to \"jump\" from\ntheir steady state values to new values, and this doesn't make sense. This happens because\nwe have approximated these thermal capacitances to be zero, and therefore their associated\ntime constants will be zero, and their responses will be infinitely fast. In the real world, we\nwould have to take these capacitances into effect.\nNow attack the time frame 1 ≤ t ≤inf. All that will change is the value of qin to 50 [W]. The\ninitial and final conditions will be\nTs(1) = -225e-1/225 + 275 = 51*C\nTs(inf) = Ta + 50 Rsa = 50*C\n·\n\nThese conditions yield A = 1 and B = 50. The solution is\nTs(t) = e-t/225 + 50\nPlug this solution into the constitutive relationships for the other devices to obtain other\nequations:\nTc(t) = Ts(t) + 50 Rcs = e-t/225 + 60\n·\nTd(t) = Tc(t) + 50 Rdc = e-t/225 + 65\n·\nThe peak device temperature happens at t = 1:\nTd(1) = -225e-1/225 + 425 = 201*C\nThis would more than likely fry the transistor.\nA bigger heatsink would not help in this case. In the limiting case as Cs →inf, Td(t) =\n200*C. This is because there must be a temperature difference that follows the constituent\nrelationship Td - Ts = .3 500 = 150*C. The device will fry just as easily at 200 *C as it would\n·\n201 *C, so even the biggest heat sink won't help this chip. Smaller thermal resistances would\nthough.

When we find the equivalent impedance, the\ncircuit becomes a voltage divider. In a voltage divider, the voltage drop across any resistor\nis simply its resistance divided by the total resistance seen at the input terminals multiplied\nby the input voltage. This is also true for impedances. The voltage we wanted to solve for\nwas across the equivalent impedance Zeq = R2 + 1 . The total impedance seen by the input\nCs\nvoltage source is Ztotal = R1 + R2 + 1 .

The non-inverting configuration gives the addition of V1 and V2, while the\ninverting configuration gives the subtraction of V3. Together, they can realize the given equation.\nThe circuit in Figure 9.6.1 gives the desired output for appropriately chosen resistors.\nAs always, we start with the equation Vo = A(s)[V+ - V-] and find V+ and V-. We then plug them\nback into the equation. Using superposition (i.e. setting Vo = 0 and solving for V , then setting\n-\nV3 = 0 and solving for V , and summing the two) gives\n-\nR4\nR5\nV\n=\nVo +\nV3\n-\nR4 + R5\nR4 + R5\nUsing the voltage divider and superposition, we find\nR2//R3\nR1//R3\nV+ =\nV2 +\nV1\nR2//R3 + R1\nR1//R3 + R2\nR2R3\nR1R3\n=\nV2 +\nV1\nR2R3 + R1(R2 + R3)\nR1R3 + R2(R1 + R3)\nPlugging these values back into the equation and solving for Vo, with A(s) having infinite gain,\ngives\nR4 + R5\nR1R3\nR2R3\nR5\nVo =\nV1 +\nV2 -\nV3\nR4\nR1R3 + R2(R1 + R3)\nR2R3 + R1(R2 + R3)\nR4 + R5\n\nThe V3 coefficient gives us the constraint that R5/R4 = 10. We arbitrarily choose R4 = 1kΩ and\nthis then sets R5 = 10kΩ. We then choose R3 = 1k, and this leaves 2 equations and 2 unknowns\nfor the coefficients of V1 and V2. Solving the system of equations gives R1 = 1kΩ and R2 = 600Ω.\nThe final solution has the following form:\nVo = K [C1V1 + C2V2 - C3V3]\nwhere K = 11, C1 = 0.4545, C2 = 0.2727, and C3 = 0.9091.\n\n9.7\nOp-Amp Block Diagram\nThe solution for this problem is not available.\n\n9.8\nOp-Amp Circuit Design 2\nVin\nR2\nR1\nC1\nC2\nVout\nFigure 9.8.1: Circuit implementation of first stage\nThe circuit in Figure 9.8.1 gives one implementation for the desired output for appropriately chosen\nresistors and capacitors. There is more than one possible design.\nAs presented in tutorials, the circuit without the C2 capacitor gives a pole at the origin and a zero.\nThis leaves us to figure out how to get an additional pole. The impedance of a capacitor is 1/Cs\nso that may be a good starting point to achieving a pole. We add a capacitor in parallel with the\ncapacitor and resistor in series and this does the trick.\nThe impedance across the negative and output terminals is\nR2Cs + 1\nZ = s(R2C1s + C1 + C2)\nWe know that for an inverting op using the infinite gain model, Vout/Vin = Z/R1. The transfer\nfunction then reduces to\nVo\nR2Cs + 1\nVin\n= -R1(C1 + C2) R\nC\nC\n+\nC\nC\n2 s + 1\nWe choose C1 = 0.01μF and that sets R2 = 100kΩ. Solving the rest of the equations, we get\nC2 = 1.11nF and R1 = 900kΩ.\nFinally, we add a negative unity gain buffer to invert the signal and make it positive overall.

We need to associate these poles and\nzeros with the breakpoints on the frequency response. We have a pole at the origin which\nis associated with the initial negative slope. We then have a zero at 200 r/s (slope goes to\n\nzero). We then have a 2nd zero at 2000 r/s and the 2nd pole at 5000 r/s. To start with we\nnote that the low frequency response is dominated by the pole at the origin. We can express\nthe low frequency magnitude as\nM(jω)\n= C2R1ω\nSince we are given R1 if we know the magnitude at some low frequency we can find C2.

The governing equation is\ndω\nc1 + c2\n+\nω = 0\ndt\nJ\nSolving this equation, we obtain\nω(t) = Ae-t/τ\nwhere τ = J/(c1 + c2) and A is determined from initial conditions. Using the initial condition\nθ (0) = ω(0) = ω0 we find A = ω0. To solve for the position θ(t), we integrate ω(t) to find\nθ(t) = - ω0 e-t/τ + C\nτ\nUsing the initial condition θ(0) = θ0, we find C = ω\nτ\n0 + θ0. Thus, the total response is\nθ(t) = θ0 + ω0\n1 - e-t/τ\nτ\nFor the translational system, we begin with the governing equation\nMx + (c1 + c2) x + (k1 + k2)x = 0\nwith the initial conditions x(0) = x0 and x(0) = v0.

The\ntotal solution is\nω(t) = Ae-t/τ + c1 + c2\nUsing the initial condition that ω(0) = 0, we obtain\n\nω(t) = c1 + c2\n1 - e-t/τ\nIntegrating this equation, and using the initial condition that θ(0) = 0, we obtain\nt\nτ\nθ(t) =\n+\ne-t/τ - 1\nc1 + c2\nc1 + c2\nwhere τ = J/(c1 + c2).\nFor the translational system, the particular solution is xp = F/(k1 + k2). The total solution is\nF\nx(t) =\n+ A1e s1t + A2e s2t\nk1 + k2\nSolving using the initial conditions, we obtain\nA1 =\nF\np-jζ\n2(k1 + k2)\n1 - ζ2 - 1\nF\njζ\nA2 =\np\n2(k1 + k2)\n1 - ζ2 - 1\nAfter some algebra, we obtain\nF\n1 - e-ζωnt\nζ sin ωdt\nx(t) =\ncos ωdt + p\nk1 + k2\n1 - ζ2\nwhere ζ = c1+c2 , ωn =\n(k1 + k2)/M, and ωd = ωn\n1 - ζ2.

The initial slope is zero\nbecause the initial velocity is zero.\nThe unit step response for the translational system is given in Figure 10.10.2. To aid in\nsketching, draw the envelope defined by the real part of s and use the damped natural\nfrequency to determine how fast the response oscillates inside of the envelope.

One is to use the lsim command\nin which you specify the system transfer function (we have not talked about this in class yet),\nthe input vector (0 t<2, 1 2<t<10, 0 t>10), and the calculation time vector (t=[0:0.01:20]).\nNote this method determines the solution by integrating from one time step to the next, thus\nfor \"Good\" results you need to have a relatively fine time vector. The advantage of this\nmethod is a relatively compact .M file.\nI calculated the response by nesting an if loop inside a for loop and calculated the exact\nresponse for each time index. I used the script 'springmasssol.m' at the end of this solution.\nFigure 12.10.1 shows the resulting plot.\n(d) The plot is basically the sum of two separate decaying sinusoids. By this I mean, the dynamic\nresponse to the first step input has largely died away before the response to the negative step\nbegins.\n(e) If the pulse were 2 sec. instead of 8 sec., the two sinusoids would act destructively with each\nother. The exact response would depend on the phase of the two sinusoid relative to one\nanother but the system would not reach 1 but still oscillate about zero. Figure 12.10.2 shows\nthis response.\n-0.2\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.2\nFigure 12.10.2: x(t) for Part e\nspringmasssol.m\nDownload\nclear all; close all; %clears the workspace and closes all figures\nt=[0:0.01:20]; %creates time vector\n%Next line creates key constants\nwd=1*sqrt(1-0.5^2); C=1/sqrt(1-0.5^2);\nphi=atan2(sqrt(1-0.5^2),0.5);\nX=[]; %Creates an empty matrix where I can store each value x(t)\nfor i=1:length(t) %starts a for loop index from 1 to the length of t\n%If loop should be clear\nif t(i)<2\n\nx=0;\nelseif t(i)<10\nx=1-C*exp(-0.5*(t(i)-2))*sin(wd*(t(i)-2)+phi);\nelse\nx=1-C*exp(-0.5*(t(i)-2))*sin(wd*(t(i)-2)+phi)...\n-(1-C*exp(-0.5*(t(i)-10))*sin(wd*(t(i)-10)+phi));\nend\nX=[X,x]; %Adds new x(t_i) to matrix x(t)\nend plot(t,X)\n\n12.11\nTransfer Function\n(a) The zeros are located at\ns1\ns2\ns3\n=\n=\n=\n-1\n-10\n-99\nThe poles are located at\ns1,2\ns3,4\n=\n=\n-0.5 ± 0.866j\n-0.5 ± 7.053j\n-100\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\nReal Axis\nIm Axis\nFigure 12.11.1: Pole zero plot\n(b) Figure 12.11.1 shows the pole/zero plot for this system.\n(c) From the pole locations, we know that the response will be a sum of sinusoids with a damped\nnatural frequency of 0.87 r/s and 7 r/s. The higher frequency sinusoid is more lightly damped\nbut since σ is the same for both sinusoids, they will decay out in the same time period.\nIn this case, we would might assume that the energy contained in each of the sinusoids is\ndx\napproximately equal. Since kinetic energy is 1\n2 mv2 and v = dt = ωd cos ωdt, we would expect\nthe magnitude of the faster sinusoid to be smaller than the magnitude of the slower sinusoid.\nThus the response will look like a large slow sinusoid with a smaller faster sinusoid added on\ntop. The impact of the zeros is a little harder to predict. The zero at -100 is so fast that any\neffect will be over so quickly that it will not effect the shape of the response. The zeros as\n-1 and -10 will impact the system response. Generally, zeros near the frequency of a complex\npole pair cause the system to overshoot more than predicted by the pole pair ζ. Thus the\n\nzero at -10 will cause the 7 r/s sinusoid to overshoot more than predicted while the zero at -1\nwill cause the 0.86 r/s sinusoid to have more overshoot. Note: if the zeros were in the right\nhalf plane they would cause the system to initially move in the negative direction.\n(d) Figure 12.11.2 shows the step response for this system.

In step 1, we analysis antenna\nsystem. Figure 13.1.1-A shows shows the free body diagram for the antenna. The control\ntorque Tm and a disturbance Td act on the antenna inertia:\nTm + Td\nJω o = Tm + Td\nωo =\n→\nJs\nωo\nθo =\ns\nThe equivalent block diagram is shown beside the FBD. Next, we need to evaluate the motor.\nFigure 13.1.1-B shows the circuit model of the motor:\nVm = RaIa + 10ωo\nVm - 10ωo\nIa =\nRa\nTm = KmIa\nThe equivalent block diagram for the motor is shown next to the circuit. We can now combine\nthe block diagrams in Figure 13.1.1 -A&B to form the block diagram in Figure 13.1.1-C. The\namplifier has the following characteristics:\nVm = G(θi - θo)\nwith the equivalent block diagram in Figure 13.1.1-D. Combining Figure 13.1.1 -C&D yields\nthe block diagram for the complete system Figure 13.1.1-E.\nIn order to find the transfer function Vo/Vi(s), we set the disturbance torque Td = 0. We\nstart by reducing the inner loop of the block diagram to:\nKm\nωo (s)\n=\nRaJs\n=\nKm\nVm\n1 + 10Km\nRaJs + 10Km\nRaJs\nWe can now address the outer loop\nGKm\nθo (s)\n=\ns(RaJs+10Km)\n=\nGKm\nθi\n1 +\nGKm\nRaJs2 + 10Kms + GKm\ns(RaJs+10Km)\nTo determine the transfer function θo/Td(s), we set θi = 0.

Figure 13.1.7 shows the bode plot of the negative\nof the loop transmission L(s). As we can see from the step response, increasing G speeds up\nthe closed-loop dynamics and reduces the damping ratio of the response. Increasing G impacts\nthe frequency response by increasing the range of frequencies for which the magnitude is at\nor near one. This means that the range of frequencies where we get good command following\nis increased. We also notice in the frequency response that the phase transition is sharper\n\nfor the higher gain system reflecting the reduced damping ration. Lastly we note, that the\nhigher gain system rejects disturbance much better (10X better to be exact). Increasing the\ngain has transformed the two real poles into a complex pole pair. Further increasing the G\nwill move the poles further up along the imaginary axis (i.e. increase ωd) without changing\nthe real component of the pole (i.e. further reduce the damping ratio).\n-10\n-5\n-10\n-5\nRe\nIm\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.2\n0.5\n1.5\nx(t)\nTime (s) (sec)\nAmplitude radians\nFigure 13.1.5: Pole map ωo/ωi(s) and step response ωo(t) for u(t)ωi for G = 100.\n\n-150\n-100\n-50\nMagnitude (dB)\n-180\n-135\n-90\n-45\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency (rad/sec)\nθο\nθι\nθο\nΤd\nFigure 13.1.6: Frequency response ωo/ωi(s) (solid line)and ωo/Td(s) (dashed line) for G=100\n-80\n-40\nMagnitude (dB)\n10-1\n\n-180\n-135\n-90\nPhase (deg)\nFrequency (rad/sec)\nFigure 13.1.7: Bode plot for the negative of the loop transmission L(s) for G=100.\n\n(g)\nθo\n(s)\n=\nθi\n10s2 + 100s + 10000\ns1,2 = -5 ± 31.2j\nθo(t) = 1 + 1.01e-5t sin (31.2t - 1.73) for u(t)ωi\nθo\n(s)\n=\nTd\n10s2 + 100s + 10000\nθo(t) =\n(1 + 1.01e-5t sin (31.2t - 1.73)) for u(t)Td\nL(s)\n= 10s2 + 100s\nωc = 30.7 r/s\nφc = -162o → φm = 18o\nFigure 13.1.8 shows the pole map and step response for ωo/ωi with a G=1000.

It is not possible to get a crossover at 14.9 r/s\nbecause of the peak from the complex pair of poles. If we set K=8.6 (the\ngain needed to raise the magnitude of the loop transmission to 1 at 14.9\nr/s), we find that the real crossover occurs at 16.9 r/s with a resulting\nphase margin of 44o.\nKg\n=\nError\n=\nK ∗Kg\n= 1\n8.6 = 0.11\nC) Figure 2 shows the loop transmission for the type 2 system.

Now it is possible to get stable closed loop\nsystems where the loop transmission phase is below -180o but these\nsystems must have magnitudes less than 1 when the phase passes through\n-180o. Since this system has 2 poles at ω = 0 we essentially have an open\nloop gain of infwhen we pass through -180o resulting in an unstable\nclosed loop system.\nFigure 13.5.1:\n\n-150\n-100\n-50\nMagnitude (dB)\n-270\n-225\n-180\n-135\n-90\nPhase (deg)\nBode Diagram\nFrequency (rad/sec)\nFigure 1: Bode diagram for Problem 2-A\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\nMagnitude (dB)\n-360\n-315\n-270\n-225\n-180\nPhase (deg)\nBode Diagram\nFrequency (rad/sec)\nFigure 2: Bode diagram for Problem 2-C\nFigure 13.5.2:\n\n-3\n-2\n-1\n-270\n-225\n-180\n-135\n-90\nPhase (deg)\nSystem: untitled1\nFrequency (rad/sec): 14.9\nPhase (deg): -133\n-150\n-100\n-50\nMagnitude (dB)\nSystem: untitled1\nFrequency (rad/sec): 14.8\nMagnitude (dB): -38.7\nBode Diagram\nFrequency (rad/sec)\nFigure 3: Intermidiate Bode plot for problem 2-D\nD To get an error=2%, 0.02 ≤1\nK →K ≥50. From part B, we know that\nwithout the lag compensator is 8.6, so if we reduce the magnitude of the\ntransfer function by a factor of ten we will raise the required gain to 86\n(this is greater than 50). The transfer function for a lag compensator is\nGlag(s) = K τs + 1\nατs + 1\nFor a lag compensator the pole occurs at a lower frequency than the zero,\nthus for the region between the pole and the zero the lag compensator has\na -1 slope. We want to drop the magnitude by a factor of 10 (1 dec) so that\ntells us that α = 10 so that the lag compensator acts over 1 decade. Now\nwe need to figure out τ. We do not want the phase of the lag compensator\nto effect the phase at our desired crossover, so τ can be any value which\nplaces the zero of the lag a decade or more below the crossover frequency.\nτ ≥\n1.49 = 0.67\nTo make life easy, I have elected to make τ = 1. Figure 3 shows the bode\nplot for tau = 1. As we can see, the magnitude is the where we wanted it\n(required gain 86) but we have actually lost some phase. This is because\nthe lag compensator is close enough to have some impact on the phase. If I\nwere designing this for myself, I would just leave it but to fix this for the\nproblem set I have set tau = 2 and recovered all but 1o of phase. Figure 4\nshows the negative loop transmission of this system with tau = 2, K = 86,\nand α = 10.\nFigure 13.5.3:\n\n-150\n-100\n-50\nMagnitude (dB)\n-3\n-2\n-1\n-270\n-225\n-180\n-135\n-90\nPhase (deg)\nBode Diagram\nFrequency (rad/sec)\nFigure 4: Bode plot for problem 2-D\nOn a design note here, I could get 0 steady state error by using the\nfollowing \"lag\" compensator\nGc(s) = K τs + 1\ns\n.\nYou may ask yourself, how is this different than changing the system to a\ntype 2 system. The answer is that because we have added a zero in\naddition to the pole the phase of the system never actually equals -180o\nat low frequencies, just gets really close. The major issue with this\napproach is that if there are any un-modelled dynamics such as time delay\nwhich cause the phase to decrease, the system will be unstable.\nE Figure 5 shows the step response of the error function for the controller\ndesigned in part d. Well the damping is much lower than expected and the\nnatural frequency is higher as well. The crossover frequency is higher than\nexpected due to the resonant peak as discussed in part b. In the case of\nthe lag controller, we find that not only is the actual crossover frequency\nabout 16.5 r/s but that lag controller has further reduced our phase\nmargin to 36o.\nF Figure 6 shows the error of my controller to a ramp input. Since, I\ndesigned my controller to have an error less than 2% and my actual error\nis about 1.6% I am happy.

The is clearly the distance the pulley moves upward, so x2 = Rθ.\n(b) Again we assume a no-slip interface and look at a rotation of θ radians. We already established\nboth that the center of the pulley moves upward a distance Rθ and that the string length\nincreases on the right hand side by a distance Rθ. That means the string length on the left\nhand side has decreased by Rθ. The position of the mass with respect to the center of the\npulley is shorter (further upward) by Rθ, and the center of the pulley has moved upward itself\nby Rθ, so x1 = 2Rθ = 2x2.\n(c) We have already derived geometric equations which show (together) that all three variables\n(x1,x2, and θ) must be linearly coupled at all time. This means we can describe the dynamics\nof the system with a single equation of motion.

If like in problem 1, the\nsystem contained dynamic elements on both sides of the transformer, the transformer would\neffect the dynamics of the system by scaling both the magnitude of the response and the\nequivalent values of the inertia, damping, and stiffness (see problem 1 where the equivalent\ninertia of the transformer is J1 + r\nr\n2 J2).\n\n14.7\nNon-Ideal Transformer\nJ1\nTb1\nTJ2\nT1\nθ1\nJ2\nTb2\nTJ2\nTk2\nθ3\nθ2\nJT\nTb3\nTk2\nFigure 14.7.1: Freebody Diagrams\nTo solve this problem we need to make a few assumptions about the model elements. First, we need\nto consider the springs connecting the inertia elements in the model. We are told to assume that\nk1 is very large, thus the input torque T1 is assumed to act directly upon J1. The next question we\nneed consider is what to do with the damping caused by the bearings. In the case of the bearing\nin the upper left of the picture, the losses associated with this bearing clearly act directly between\nground (θ = 0) and the inertia J1. Less clear is how to handle the bearing in the center of the\npicture. Our first instinct would be to set this bearing to act between J2 and JL. We can see that\nthis would be incorrect since the bearing drag would go to 0 when θ 2 = θ 3 (θ 3 is the rotational\nvelocity of J2). This is clearly incorrect since the bearing still generates a drag between the shaft\nand ground. There are three different assumptions we can make instead. One, we can have the\nbearing drag act between J2 and ground. Two, we could instead have the bearing drag act between\nJL and ground. Lastly, we could split the drag and have it act between ground and JL and J2. All\nare equally valid but I will solve the problem by splitting the drag between the two inertia.\n(a) Figure 14.7.1 shows the free body diagrams for the three inertias in the model. Note the\ninclusion of the torque TJ2 on inertias J1 and J2. This torque represents the torque through\nthe gear transformer and will be solved algebraically later. All the other torques are expressed\nas follows (T1 is an input thus not accounted for here):\nTb1 = b1θ 1\nTb2 = b2θ 3\nTk2 = k2(θ2 - θ3)\nTb3 = b3θ 2\n\nX\nThe equations of motion then become\nJθ\n=\nT\n\nJ1θ1 = T1 - Tb1 - TJ2\nJ1θ 1 + b1θ 1 = T1 - TJ2\n\nJ2θ3 = -TJ2 - Tb2 - Tk2\nJ2θ 3 + b2θ 3 + k2θ3 = k2θ2 - TJ2\n\nJLθ2 = Tk2 - Tb3\nJLθ 2 + b3θ 2 + k2θ2 = k2θ3\n(b) Now that we have written the equations of motion, we need to eliminate the unknown torque\nTJ2. To do this we apply our knowledge about the transformer which equate θ1andθ3.

The inner gear has a pen fixed\nat a radius r3 from its center. The resulting path of the pen is most easily described as that\nof the center of the gear (which just moves in a circular path) superimposed with the position\nof the pen with respect to the center of the gear. The angle between the fixed center of the\nouter hole and the center of the gear at any given time is θ1, while the corresponding angle\nfrom the center of the gear to the pen is θ3. θ3 and θ1 are proportional to one another.

Substituting relations given in the m-file, we obtain\nposition = 2r0ejθ1 + g2 sin(Nθ1)ejθ1 + r2e-jg1θ1\n(1)\nTherefore, we recognize that the diameter of the main figure is 2r0. This circle of main\ndiameter is modulated by two additional terms, g2 sin(Nθ1)ejθ1 and r2e-jg1θ1 . g2sin(Nθ1)ejθ1\nhas the same angle θ1 as the main circle but the modulation changes as the angle changes. For\nN > 1, the size of the perturbation changes faster than θ1. The other perturbation r2e-jg1θ1\nhas a primary radius r2. The perturbation rotates in the opposite direction from the direction\nof tracing out the large circle of radius r0 and with a different speed based on the magnitude\nof g1 (see Figure 15.4.2 for a diagram explaining the variables). r1 is a dependent variable\nbecause it is calculated in the m-file.\n(b) Using Equation (1) we can separate position into its real and imaginary parts using z =\nrejθ = r cos θ + jr sin θ.

If\nωss is the same for the disc mounted and not mounted, the damping coefficient Bm must also\nbe the same in both cases. In the transient, it is necessary to consider the complete dynamic\nanalysis. The constitutive equations are\nTI = I dωm\nand\nTfric = Bmωm\ndt\nwhere I is the total moment of inertia of the rotating parts, and the torque balance is\nTI = Tm - Tfric\nwhich lead to the differential equation\ndωm\nI\ndωm\nTm\nI\n+ Bmωm = Tm\nor\n+ ωm =\ndt\nBm\ndt\nBm\nfrom which we learn that the decay time-constant is τ = I/Bm.

With no friction, this is the\nonly force, and the equation of motion is\ndv\nmg sin(alpha) = m dt\n\ns\nIntegrating this equation from the initial condition v = 0 at t = 0 yields\nv = gt sin(alpha)\nLet s represent distance down the track from the starting point, so that ds/dt = v.

To indicate the effect of increas\ning the weight, you can run the program again with all the same data, except with the mass\nincreased to 0.1701 kg (6 ounces) to get a final velocity of 3.53 m/s at the end of 2.35 seconds.\n(b) The limiting speed or 'terminal velocity' established in Problem 16.5 is vss = 8.60 m/s. The\nspeed which is 99.9 % of this is 8.591 m/s. To determine the time it takes to reach this speed,\nfix the values of m = 0.1418 kg, (alpha) = 10.81 degrees, and b = 0.0303 kg/sec, and run the\nprogram for a sequence of time intervals, iterating toward a final velocity of 8.591 m/s.

If we test the MATLAB\nprogams with the given data, we find that for the very large times, T = 70 to T = 100, the\nfinal velocity is essentially constant at v = 8.61045 m/s; i.e., the program believes that the\nterminal velocity is not 8.60 m/s, but 8.61045 m/s. If we then iterate to a final velocity of\n8.602 m/s, which is 99.9% of 8.61045 m/s, we find that the time required is T = 32.5 sec,\nwhich is 14% larger than our previous result of 28.5 sec.\n\nTime [seconds]\nSpeed, [meters/second]\nSpeed of car on incline\nFigure 16.6.3: Plot for Part (b)\ncarsol.m\nDownload\n% carsol.\n% This program calculates the velocity of a car rolling down an incline\n% under the influence of viscous friction\n% The differential equation used to model the car i\n% m dv/dt = m g sin(alpha) - b\n%\n% This equation is stored in a separate m-file 'car_visc_sol' called by this\n% program (a tedious MATLAB detail\n% Declare global parameters (a MATLAB detail\nglobal g alpha b\n% Input parameter value\ng= 9.81\nm = input('Enter the mass of the car in SI units: ')\nalpha = input('Enter the angle of the incline in degrees: ')\nb = input('Enter the value of the friction coefficient \"b\" in SI units: '\n%Input initial conditions.\nv0 = input('Enter the initial velocity in SI units: '\n% Input integration time.\ntspan = input('Enter time interval of integration in seconds: ');\n% Call a numerical integration algorithm.\n[t,v] = ode45('carviscsol', tspan, v0);\n% Plot the results.\nplot(t,v)\nxlabel('Time [seconds]')\nylabel('Speed, [meters/second]')\ntitle('Speed of car on incline')\ngrid\n\n% Print out speed at final instant.\n%\nN = max(size(v));\nFinalspeed = v(N)\ncarviscsol.m\nDownload\n%\ncarviscsol.m\n% This function, which is called by the program 'car.m', contains the\n% equation of motion of a car on an incline subjected to viscous friction.\n%\n%\nIntroduce\nV_dot, the time derivative of v.\n%\nfunction V_dot = carviscsol(t,v)\n%\n% Declare global parameters (a MATLAB detail).\n%\nglobal g alpha b m\n%\n% The mathematical model of the car provides an equation for v_dot.\n%\nV_dot = g * sin(alpha * pi/180) - (b/m) * v;\n%\n% That's all there is to it!\n\nZ\nZ\n16.7\nPinewood Derby 4\n(a) Replace fviscous by fdrag to get the free body diagram of the car mass acted on by the\ncomponent of the weight, and the retarding form-drag force, shown below.\nACd v2 sgn (v)\nv\nm\nmg sin α\nFigure 16.7.1: Model Diagram\nThe equation of motion for the model is\nmdv = mg sin α - ACdv 2sgn v\ndt\n(b) The dimensions of the force fdrag are [F ] = [M][L]/[T 2]; the dimensions of the area A are\n[L2]; the dimensions of the velocity squared v2 = [L2]/[T 2]; and the signum function is\ndimensionless.

For example:\nTry T = 10 secs, get V = 8.362 m/s\nTry T = 20 secs, get V = 8.594 m/s\nTry T = 19 secs, get V = 8.5919 m/s\nTry T = 18.9 secs, get V = 8.5917 m/s\nTry T = 18.8 secs, get V = 8.5915 m/s\nTry T = 18.7 secs, get V = 8.5913 m/s\nTry T = 18.75 secs, get V = 8.5914 m/s (close enough)\nThis result is not very accurate, because of round-off error. The value 0.00353 kg/m obtained\nin (b) above for the parameter aCd was rounded off to three significant figures. If we assume\nthat ACd is exactly equal to 0.00353 kg/m, and work backwards we find that vss is not exactly\nequal to 8.60 m/s but is actually 8.5958 m/s correct to five significant figures. If we repeat\nthe exercise we find that at T = 17.45 sec, the final speed is 8.5872 m/s which is 99.9 % of\n8.5958 m/s. Both of the previous results assume that there are no errors in the integration\ncarried out by MATLAB. MATLAB is pretty good, but it does make small errors which can\naccumulate over a long integration. If we let it run for long times T , we find that throughout\nthe range from T = 35 secs to T = 70 secs, the final speed is essentially constant (to five\nsignificant figures) at 8.5970 m/s; i.e., MATLAB disagrees, in the fourth significant figure,\nwith both vss = 8.6000 m/s and vss = 8.5958 m/s.\n(d) In Problem 4(b) of Problem 16.7, it was found that with viscous friction the time to reach\n99.9% of the terminal velocity was in the neighborhood of 28.5 to 32.5 seconds. Here, with\nform drag, the same speed is reached in about 17.45 to 18.75 seconds. With form drag\n(quadratic speed dependence) the terminal velocity is approached more quickly than is the\ncase for viscous friction (linear speed dependence). The time histories of velocity for the two\nmodels are shown in the Fig. 2(d)-1.\n\nTime [seconds]\nSpeed, [meters/second]\nSpeed of car on incline\nViscous Friction\nForm Drag\nFigure 16.8.1: Fig. 2(d)-1\nTo explain why a car with quadratic drag approaches the terminal velocity more rapidly than a\ncar with linear drag, compare the constitutive equations for the retarding forces as shown in Fig.\n16.8.2. At all speeds below the common terminal velocity there is less retardation with form drag\nthan there is for viscous friction. This means that, when both cars have the same velocity, the\ncar with form drag accelerates faster than the car with viscous friction. Now the the slopes of the\nvelocity curves in Fig. 16.8.1 represent the accelerations of the cars. Thus at each speed, the form\ndrag curve will have a steeper slope than the viscous friction curve. As a consequence the form\ndrag curve must approach the terminal velocity more quickly than the viscous friction curve.\n\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\nConstitutive Equations for Retarding Forces\nVelocity [meters/second]\nRetarding force [Newtons]\nForm Drag\nViscous Friction\nFigure 16.8.2: Fig. 2(d)-2\nNOTE re MATLAB technique: To plot two graphs in the same Figure, as in Fig. 2(d)-1.

The excess tensile force in each spring due to a displacement yk is fki = kcyk\n(i = 1, ···, 4).\nThe total vertical spring force is fk = 4fki = 4kcyk = kyk. The constitutive equation for the mass\nis Newton's law fm = mdvm/dt. When friction is absent and there is no external load, the force\nbalance equation is simply -fk = fm, or\ndvm\ndvk\n-kyk = m\n,\nor\n- kyk = m\ndt\ndt\non using the geometric compatibility condition vm = vk.

The roots of the characteristic equation are +iωo and -iωo, and the general\nsolution of the differential erquation is\nyk = A exp(iωot) + B exp(-iωt)\nAn alternative form of the general solution can be obtained by introducing Euler's formula exp(iωot) =\ncos ωot + i sin ωot.\nyk = C1cosωot + C2 sin ωot\nThese two forms of solution are equivalent if the constants of integration are related as follows:\nC1 = A + B\nA =\n(C1 + C2)\nC2 = A - B\nB = 2(C1 - C2)\n\nThe given initial conditions are yk(0) = 0 and dyk/dt(0) = vo. Using the trigonometric form of the\ngeneral solution, we have\nyk = C1 cos ωot + C2 sin ωot\nand\ndyk = -C1ωo sin ωot + C2ωo cos ωot\ndt\nSetting t = 0 yields\nC1 = 0\nand\nC2 = vo\nωo\nso the displacement history of the plate, starting from rest at the equilibrium position with the\ninitial velocity vo is\nyk(t) = vo sin ωot\nωo\n\np\np\n16.13\nPlate On Springs 2\nThe unloaded plate system here is the same as that considered in Problem 16.12. The mass of the\nplate is m and the effective stiffness of the four springs is k. The natural frequency of the unloaded\nsystem is ωo where ω2 = k/m. When the book of mass m/2 is attached to the plate, the resulting\nsystem has mass 3m/2 and stiffness k, and its natural frequency of free oscillation is ω1 where\nω1\n2 = 2k/3m. The oscillations in both Case I and Case II involve motions with the book attached\nto the plate. The difference between Cases I and II lies in the initial conditions, not in the basic\nsystem.\n(a) The ratio of frequencies of Case I oscillations to unloaded plate oscillations is ω1/ωo =\n2/3 =\n0.816.\n(b) The ratio of frequencies of Case II oscillations to unloaded plate oscillations is ω1/ωo =\n2/3 = 0.816.\n(c) In the (book + plate) system there is an additional gravity load of mg/2, so the equilibrium\nposition of the (book + plate) system is beneath the equilibrium position of the unloaded\nplate by a distance of Δ = mg/2k.\n(d) In Case I the system starts from rest at the equilibrium position of the unloaded plate.\nViewed from the equilibrium position of the (book + plate) system, the initial displacement\nyk(0) = Δ, and the initial velocity is dyk/dt(0) = 0.\n(e) In Case II there is an initial velocity dyk/dt(0) = -v1 imparted by the impact of the book\nupon the plate. This initial velocity can be determined by applying conservation of linear\nmomentum to the impact. Immediately before the impact the plate has no momentum while\nthe book has a downward momentum of 1/2mvo. Immediately after the impact the (book\n+ plate) has the downward momentum 3mv1/2. For these two momenta to be equal it\nis necessary that v1 = vo/3. The initial conditions for Case II are thus: yk(0) = Δ and\ndyk/dt(0) = -vo/3.\n(f) The general solution for both Case I and Case II is the same as the general solution for\nProblem 16.12, except that ωo is everywhere replaced by ω1. For Case I, the initial conditions\nrequire\nyk(0) = Δ = C1\nand\ndyk\ndt (0) = 0 = C2ω1\nso that\nyk(t) = Δ cos ω1t\nwhere Δ = mg/2k, and ω1\n2 = 2k/3m.\nFor Case II, the initial conditions require\nyk(0) = Δ = C1\nand\ndyk (0) = -v1 = C2ω1\ndt\nso that\nyk(t) = Δ cos ω1t - v1 sin ω1t\nω1\nwhere Δ = mg/2k, v1 = vo/3, and ω1\n2 = 2k/3m\n\n16.14\nMousetrap Dynamics 1\nThe solution for this problem is not available.\n\n16.15\nMousetrap Dynamics 2\nThe solution for this problem is not available.\n\n16.16\nMousetrap Dynamics 3\nThe solution for this problem is not available.\n\n16.17\nMousetrap Dynamics 4\nThe solution for this problem is not available.\n\n16.18\nHydraulic Elevator Design\n(a) As the elevator falls, there is both the constant force due to the acceleration of gravity and a\ndamping force which is proportional to (and in a direction opposing) the velocity.\nΣF = ma\n-mg - cv = ma\ncx + mx = -mg\nNote that the x coordinate is defined to be positive in the up direction. Therefore, mg is in\nthe negative x direction. The cv term must always act in opposition to the direction of the\nvelocity. (If the mass is moving in the negative x direction, velocity is negative, and the force\nacts in the positive direction to slow the fall, for instance.)\nWhen the elevator suddenly fails, whatever force has been compensating for the force of\ngravity (from tension in elevator cables or force applied by the hydraulic lift, etc) suddenly\ndisappears, resulting in a net step in force. Thus, the fall of the elevator can be well-modeled\nas a 1st order system with a step input:\ncx + mx = -mg us(t)\n·\n(cs + ms 2)X(s) = -mgU(s) = -mg s mg\nX(s) = -s2(c + ms)\nNote that the velocity and acceleration are just the first and second derivatives of x(t):\nmg\nV (s) = sX(s) = -s(c + ms)\nA(s) = s 2X(s) = - mg\nc + ms\nThe acceleration, A(s), should look familiar; it is just the Laplace domain representation of a\n1st order system. We know the response will start at some value (which we can find by using\nthe I.V.T.) and go to some steady state value (which we can find by using the F.V.T.) via an\nexponential decay with some time constant. Rewriting A(s),\nA(s) = s 2X(s) = - mg/c\nm s + 1\nc\nit should be clear to you that the time constant is:\nm\n2000kg\nτ =\n=\n= 1 [s]\nc\n2000kg/sec\n\nUsing the Initial Value Theorem:\nA(0) = lim s mg/c = -gm/c = -g = -9.8 [m/s2]\ns→inf\nm\nc s + 1\nm/c\nThis is what wed expect from the basic physics. Using the Final Value Theorem:\nA(inf) = lim s mg/c = 0 [m/s2]\ns\nm s + 1\n→\nc\ntherefore\na(t) = -9.8e-t [m/s2]\nv(t) = 9.8e-t + C1 [m/s]\nTo match the initial condition that v(0)=0,\nv(t) = 9.8e-t - 9.8 [m/s]\nPosition can be obtain by taking another integral:\nx(t) = -9.8e-t - 9.8t + C2\nThen we need to match i.c.s again:\nx(t) = -9.8e-t - 9.8t + 9.8\nYou can use the step() function in MATLAB to plot the step response of a system (given its\ntransfer function), rather than deriving it by hand (as above).\nFigure 16.18.1 are plots of position, velocity and acceleration. We can first solve to find the\ntime at which the elevator has reached 10 meters.

For conve\nnience, well redefine time such that t=0 when the elevator hits and x=0 where the elevator\nhits.\nTo get the velocity to settle within .1 m/s as quickly as possible, well aim for a response which\novershoots by just under 0.1 m/s. This would be close to critically damped. (The velocity at\nimpact is about 8.3 m/s, so a response which slows down and then reverse to move upward\nat no more than 0.1 m/s would have an overshoot of about 1.2%.)\n\nIts fine to have a response which overshoots by more than this amount, but note that this\nwill generally increase the time needed for the system to settle.\nFigure 16.18.2 shows the response with the following parameters:\nk = 6990 [N/m]\nc = 2000 + 5300 [Ns/m]\n-5\na (m/s 2)\nAcceleration\n-10\n-5\nv (m/s)\nVelocity\n-3\n-2\n-1\nx (m)\nTime (seconds)\nPosition\nFigure 16.18.2: Plot of Position, Velocity and Acceleration with k = 6990 [N/m] and c = 2000+5300\n[Ns/m]\n\nNote that the acceleration requirement is barely met (under 20 m/s2) at t=0, and that the\nposition goes down to a minimum value of almost 3 meters!! (Thats a large of deflection in\nthe system...)\nThe system settles to within 0.1 m/s in about 1.24 seconds.\nFor a problem like this, you may find it convenient to write a MATLAB script or function, so\nyou can iterate through possible solutions and develop at intuition about the dynamics of the\nsystem. (Here, since the system is allowed to overshoot, you can calculate the free and forced\nresponses for an underdamped second order system as in 2.27, given the initial conditions\n(v=vhit) and step in force (m*g).\nBelow is a second alternative which puts more importance on minimizing the maximum\ndeflection. The settling time is a bit longer (2.4 sec; about 2x that of the previous solution).\nThe maximum deflection is cut by about 40% (from 3m to 1.8m).

In both\ncases the motion starts from the original equilibrium position of the system. In both cases the\nmass oscillates for a few cycles and comes to rest. The damped natural frequency and damp\ning ratio is the same in both oscillations. The final rest position is the same as the original\nequilibrium position in the ball-impact case, while the final rest position in the step-function\nforce case is the new equilibrium position under a constant load of 5 pounds. The initial\nvelocity in the step-function force case is zero (displacement response starts with zero slope),\nwhile the initial velocity in the ball-impact case is large due to the impact (displacement\nresponse starts with a steep slope). For the particular magnitudes of the excitations given\nthe oscillation in the ball-impact case is more intense than the oscillation due to the suddenly\napplied force.\n\n16.25\nPlate On Springs Damped 4\nDue to the application of a 1.0 Newton step-force, the system oscillates at its damped natural\nfrequency ωd about the new equilibrium position yk = Δ. From the given Displacement Response\nplot, the equilibrium offset Δ can be estimated to be Δ = 4.4 x 10-4 meters. The damped natural\nfrequency can be estimated by counting the cycles, 10, in 2.0 seconds, which gives a damped\nperiod Td = 0.2 seconds, and ωd = 2π/Td = 31.4 rad/sec. The logarithmic decrement LDR can\nbe estimated by measuring the ratios of successive peak amplitudes. This is generally a difficult\nmeasurement to make accurately. One way to increase the accuracy is to make a large number of\nmeasurements based on different pairs of successive peaks, and average the results. Draw a line\nacross the plot at y = Δ and measure the amplitudes of several peaks. Since only the ratio of\nsuccessive peaks will be used, the measurements can be in terms of any convenient length unit.\nThe measurements below are in millimeters.\nStation Amplitude Ratio\n6.22\n4.86\n-\n0.781\n4.00\n0.823\n3.08\n0.770\n2.56\n0.831\n1.94\n0.758\n1.68\n0.866\nThe average of these first six ratios is 0.805, so the estimate for the LDR is ln 0.805 = -0.217.\n(a) The estimated stiffness is\nfa\n1.0\nk =\n=\n= 2270 Newtons/meter\nΔ\n4.4 × 10-4\n(b) To estimate the mass m, when the stiffness k is known, it is necessary to know the undamped\nnatural frequency ωo. At this point we know only the damped natural frequency ωd. We\ncan postpone estimation of the mass m until the damping ratio ζ is estimated in (c) below,\nor we can assume, since more than ten cycles of oscillation are visible, that the damping is\nsufficiently light to permit us to make the approximation that ωo ≈ ωd, in which case\nk\nm ≈ ωd\n2 = (31.4)2 = 2.30 kg\n(c) To estimate the damping parameter b, we need to know the damping ratio ζ. The damping\nratio follows from the log decrement ratio, LDR, according to the formula:\nLDR2\nζ2 = π2 + LDR2\nInsertion of the estimation LDR = -0.217 yields ζ ≈ 0.069.

In problems like this, where relative\nmotion is involved, it is important to remember that Newton's law only applies to motions with\nrespect to an inertial reference frame\nk\nb\nb\nk\nm\nvtruck\nvengine\nxrel\nFigure 16.29.1: Model of Engine in Crate on Moving Truck\n(a) The geometric compatibility conditions are\ndxrel = vrel\nand\nvengine = vtruck + vrel\ndt\nThe constitutive equations are\nfm = mdvengine ,\nfspring = kxrel,\nand\nfdamping = bvrel\ndt\nand the force balance condition is\nfm = -2fspring - 2fdamping\nThe six preceding equations constitute a mathematical model for the longitudinal motion of\nthe engine with respect to the crate.\n(b) A single differential equation in terms of xrel can be derived by inserting the spring force\nfspring = kxrel and the damping force fdamping = bdxrel/dt in the force-balance equation,\n\nalong with fm expressed as fm = m(dvtruck/dt + d2xrel/dt2). The result is\nmd2xrel + 2bdxrel + 2kxrel = -mdvtruck\ndt2\ndt\ndt\nThe form of this equation is similar to that for the equation for the displacement of the steel\nplate on springs. Here the unknown response is a relative displacement and the driving force\nis the negative of the force that would be required to give the engine the same acceleration\nas the truck. A single differential equation for the relative velocity of the engine with respect\nto the crate is obtained by differentiating every term in the preceding equation.\nmd2vrel + 2bdvrel + 2kvrel = -md2vtruck\ndt2\ndt\ndt2\n(c) A state-determined system for the state variables xrel and veng can be obtained by expressing\nthe forces in the force-balance equation of (a) in terms of xrel and vrel = veng - vtruck.

We can rewrite this as h2 = 2heq - h1. Note also that h 1 + h 2 = 0.\n(d) The pressure at the bottom of the tank 1 is P1 - Pa = ρgh1. Again for tank 2 P2 - Pa = ρgh2.\nNote that atmospheric pressure Pa has a slightly different notation than Pascals, the SI units\nfor pressure are [N/m2].\n(e) Define q positive inward, q1 flowing into tank 1, q2 flowing into tank 2.

      "content": "2.003 Problem Set 4\nAssigned: Fri. Feb. 25, 2005\nDue: Fri. Mar. 4, 2005, in recitation\nNote: While this problem set is due on Friday March 4, the first 5 problems are taken from earlier\nquizzes; working all these problems in advance of Quiz 1 is highly recommended. Each of the first\n5 problems is intended to be something you can complete in about 30 minutes in a quiz. We are\nnot providing solutions to these problems. If you cannot work these to your satisfaction, you\nshould definitely consult with course staff or other students to gain mastery of the required\nmaterial. Problem 6 is somewhat longer, but provides a good practice problem for fluid systems.\nThe last problem is looking for qualitative answers to get you to think physically about the\nproblems you've been solving.\nProblem 1 Archive Problem 17.2\nProblem 2 Archive Problem 17.3\nProblem 3 Archive Problem 17.15\nProblem 4 Archive Problem 17.17\nProblem 5 Archive Problem 17.22\nProblem 6 This problem considers the fluid system shown below.\nAs shown in the figure, the system consists of a pump which acts as a pressure source. Be sure\nyou realize that this means the pressure at the pump outlet Ps is set by the pump independent\nof the pump output flow. The pump is connected to the first tank by fluid resistance R1;\nnote that this means that the pressure at the lefthand side of R1 is equal to Ps. The first\ntank has crosssectional area A1, and the height of the fluid above the inlet level is defined as\nh1. The first tank is connected to the second tank by fluid resistance R2, and the height of\nthe fluid above the inlet level is defined as h2. The fluid flows in resistances R1 and R2 are\nq1 and q2, respectively.\n\nAll quantities in this problem are in MKS units. All pressures are measured with respect to\nvacuum. The fluid being pumped is mercury (don't try this at home, kiddies!) with a density\nof ρ ≈ 13.5 × 103 kg/m3. The system is also assumed to be subjected to an ambient pressure\nPatm = 105 Pa.\nThe numerical values of the parameters are R1 = 1.32 × 109 Pa sec/m3 , R2 = 1.32 ×\n1010 Pa sec/m3, and A1 = A2 = 5 × 10-4 m2 . Recall that the fluidic capacitance of tanks\nsuch as in this problem is given by A/ρg where g is the acceleration of gravity.\na) Develop a differential equation which describes this system in terms of the pressure Ps(t) as\nan input, and the height of fluid in the righthand tank h2(t) as an output. Plot the system\npoles in the splane. Indicate which of the two poles will have the slower response.\nb) Now assume that the system is initially at rest (h1 = h2 = 0, Ps = Patm ). Further assume that\nat t = 0 the pump pressure takes a step change given by Ps(t) = Patm + (105 us(t)) Pa. Write\na solution for the response h2(t), and sketch this response as a function of time.\nProblem 7 This question follows the water in the basement problem (6.3) that was due on Friday.\nThis question is intended to explore your qualitative understanding of the course material.\nWe do not expect any detailed analytical developments for this question; rather try to use\nyour physical intuition for what is happening, and answer the question in words rather than\nequations. Prior to the roller blades breaking the pipe (in engineering we often call this time\nt < 0), water was in the pipe heading from the pressure tank to the shower head. Imagine\na very small volume of this water, about the size of a pea (call it v), which at the time of\nthe break ( t = 0 ) was at a height equal to the height of the floor of the home on which the\nshower stall rests, or just a bit below the toes of the person in the shower.\na) Describe, in no more than a few sentences, the height, with respect to this floor (floor height\n=0), of our small volume of water, v, during the one half second prior to the breaking of the\npipe.\nb) Sketch a plot of the height of our water volume, v, during this time interval one half second\nprior to the breaking of the pipe.\nc) Describe, in no more than a paragraph, the height with respect to the floor (floor height = 0)\nof our small volume of water, v, during the five seconds following the breaking of the pipe.\nd) Sketch a plot that describes the height of the water volume, v, during this 5 second time interval."

An input source of\ntorque τ1 is applied to J1 in the direction of ω1. As shown in the figure, the gear train has a\nratio of N : 1; that is, ω2 = Nω1.\na) Assume that the input torque source has a constant value of τ = τ0. What value of N will\nmaximize the acceleration of the load ω2?\nb) For this accelerationoptimum gear ratio, what is the equivalent inertia of J2 as seen by J1\nlooking through the gear train? That is, what is the reflected inertia of J2 on the J1 side?\nHow does this compare with J1?\nc) The power input to the system is Pin = τ1ω1. For the optimum gear ratio calculated above,\nmake a plot of Pin(t) assuming that the load starts at rest at t = 0.\n\nProblem 8 This problem focuses on the motor connected to a load shown below. The motor is\ndriven by an input voltage V in series with a coil resistance R. The motor is assumed ideal,\nwith no energy storage or losses inside the motor. The motor is connected to a load inertia\nJ > 0 and rotational damper b ≥ 0. The motor shaft and load rotate at angular velocity ω.\nThe motor applies a torque to the load τ = Ki in the direction of ω; correspondingly, the\nback emf is e = Kω.\na) Write a differential equation describing the system in terms of the input voltage V (t) and the\noutput speed ω(t). Write an equivalent differential equation with input V (t) and output i(t).\nb) Assume that the system is initially at rest, and that at t = 0 the input voltage takes a step\nV (t) = V0us(t). Solve for the resulting transient in i(t) and ω(t), and make a plot of these\ntwo quantities as a function of time.\nc) What are the steadystate values of i and ω? In steadystate, write an expression for the power\nbeing dissipated on the mechanical side in the load damper b, and on the electrical side in\nthe resistor R. How much power is being supplied in steadystate by the voltage source? Is\nthis in balance with the dissipation? In this steadystate, how much kinetic energy is stored\nin the load intertia J?\nd) Make a plot of steadystate load power dissipation as a function of load damping b for b ≥ 0.\nWhat value of b results in maximum power dissipation in the load? How does this compare\nwith the electrical equivalent damping term K2/R? For this maximum power value of b, how\nmuch power is being dissipated in the resistor R?\ne) Finally, suppose we allow negative values of the load damping. Note that a negative damper\nwill supply power to the load. For what range of b < 0 will the system be stable? For what\nrange of b < 0 will the system be unstable?"

      "content": "Think of problem 2 as consisting of the spring, mass and dampers moving for a long time\n(-inf<t<0) and then we stop the mass M as t=0+ (this is clear from the given velocity\nsource pulling M.)\nFor t<0 the velocity source can be achieved by, say, a force F acting on Mass M pulling it\nwith a constant velocity v1(t<0)=1. Given this force on M, the spring attains an\nequilibrium extension, after which its ends move at the same velocity. If not, i.e. if v1>v2\nor v2>v1 we will have the spring getting indefinitely extended or compressed\nrespectively.\nThe extension of the spring for equilibrium at t=0- is x(0-)=b2*v2(0-)/k\nwhere v2(0-)=v1(0-)\nWe obtain the above from equilibrium of the massless damper. You can't do something\nlike x(0-)=b1*v1(0-)/k, since if you consider the equilibrium of the mass M, you get\nF=kx(0-)+b1*v1.\nYou will see that F has to be a constant 10N force so that the velocity source v1(t<0)=1 is\nachieved.\nx(0+) must be the same as x(0-) for continuity. Note however that xdot(0+) need not be\nthe same as xdot(0-)\nSolution to Part C is clear since you know that for t=0+, Mass M is at rest. The free body\ndiagram of the massless damper should give you the answer. In Part(d) you use the initial\nconditions in Part (b) to get the solution to the differential equation."

      "content": "2.003\nGetdata*.m User Guide\n(r)\nThe getdata* family of functions for MATLAB were created to help plot\nthe measured system response and to help verify the system pole locations.\nThe functions can be used with underdamped, critically damped, and over\ndamped second order systems as well as first order systems. The functions are\navailable in the X:\\2.003 course locker on the MECHENG domain. The files\ncan be accessed by either copying the files to the individual user's directory\nor with the addpath function.\n[t,y]=Getdata(fname)\n1. This function plots the data in the given file (specified in single quotes\ne.g. fname='tek00001.dat').\n2. It also outputs two vectors: a time vector and a data vector. These\nvectors can then be operated on, and modification of the plot can be\nmade based on these two vectors.\n3. The Tektronix scope saves the data (in Mathcad format) with 4 initial\nheader values. They are\n- The number of data points\n- The time per sample interval\n- The trigger location\n- The trigger offset\nThe last two items are not used in this function.\n4. Students can use the plot produced by this function to estimate the\ntwo poles of a secondorder system, or equivalently, the damping ratio\nand natural frequency.\n[t,y,y final]=Getdata3(fname,p1,p2)\n1. This function plots the data in the given file (specified in single quotes,\neg. fname='tek00001.tek').\n2. The function will also plot the step response of the system constructed\nfrom values of two poles p1 and p2 that should be estimated from the\nresponse plotted by Getdata(fname).\nStudents can then judge how\nclose these two plots are and decide whether any modification of the\ntwo poles should be made in order to produce a closer match.\nFor\ncomplex conjugate poles, a decay envelope is plotted in addition to the\nsimulated time response.\n\n2.003\nGetdata*.m User Guide\n3. The function will also simulate first order responses, if p1 is specified\nand p2 left out.\n4. The user will be asked to click on the initial data point and on a data\npoint equal to the final value. These two data points are used to scale\nthe plot and the simulated response. Matching the simulated response\nto the measured response is simplified by picking the first peak or valley\nas the initial data point.\n[t,y,y final]=Getdata4(fname,p1,p2,yfinal)\n1. This function is the same as getdata3.m, except you can enter the final\nvalue of the response, instead of clicking.\n2. This feature is useful when a system is lightly damped and it takes a\nlong time for the system to settle down: however, we know the final\nvalue of the response from theory."

From your data, determine a value (or values) for the damping co\nefficient b associated with the Airpot. Repeat for at least one other\nsignificantly different Airpot setting.\nPart Two. For the remainder of this lab, we will study two screen\ndoor closing mechanisms and compare their behaviors with that of the\nidealized springdamp er system in Part One. One of the screen door\nmechanisms uses an oilbased damper, and the other uses a gas cylinder\n(similar to the Airpot we used in Part One).\nPlay with both the airdamper and oildamper mechanisms. (The lab\ninstructors can show you how to swap the two mechanisms and how to\nadjust the damping in each.)\n4. Describe the difference(s) in behavior you notice between the two (air\nvs. oil) screen door mechanisms. Which mechanism do you feel has\na dynamic response which is more similar to the idealized cantilever\nAirpot system from Part One? Propose modification(s) to our first\norder model (e.g. additional spring, mass and/or damper elements)\nwhich capture some of the unmodeled dynamics you observe.

From your own observations, do you find that the dynamic response of\nthe cantileverAirpot system in Part One depends at all on either the\ndirection from which you release the cantilever or the amplitude of the\ndisplacement?

      "content": "Chapter 1\nNatural Response\nA significant portion of these notes are concerned with the study of finite-\ndimensional, linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. We will define this term\nwith more care in section 1.3.2. Such systems can be described by finite-\norder linear constant coefficient differential equations. Such models are\nwidely applicable to physical systems. In this chapter, we will be primarily\nconcerned with the natural response of such models, which is defined as the\nresponse which occurs solely from initial conditions with no other inputs.\nThe natural response is also known as the unforced response or characteristic\nresponse. The model differential equation for such a system is homogeneous,\nin that there is no forcing term.\nThere is a beautiful property of LTI systems: the homogeneous or natural\nresponse can be very simply found. It is composed of weighted sums of\nfunctions est, where s is possibly complex (or most generally such functions\nmultiplied by polynomials in the time variable t). This is a statement about\nthe solution of differential equations. However, it is a remarkable empirical\nresult that such differential equations well-describe many physical systems.\nSaid another way, the types of natural responses discussed below can be\neasily observed in an experimental context, and in observations of many\nphysical phenomena. The natural response ties things together.\nA further surprising result is that real-world systems are frequently able\nto be represented in terms of very simple models of first- or second-order.\nWhen higher-order models are required, these systems have responses com\nposed of sums of first- and second-order responses. So it's very worthwhile\nto understand the building-block first- and second-order responses in depth.\nThis chapter is organized as follows: We present first-order systems, and\ntheir natural response, starting with a mechanical example. The charac\n\nCHAPTER 1. NATURAL RESPONSE\nteristics of such first-order responses in time are discussed in detail. These\nresponses involve only real functions and thus use only real mathematics.\nNext we present the similar first-order responses encountered in electrical,\nthermal, and fluidic systems.\nSecond-order systems in general have complex-valued natural responses.\nThus the section on second-order systems starts with a review of complex\nnumbers. The natural responses for a second-order mechanical system are\npresented, with individual attention to the overdamped, critically-damped,\nand underdamped cases. Section 1.2 presents second-order system natural\nresponses. Analogous electrical, thermal, and fluidic second-order systems\nare discussed next.\nFinally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of the natural response\nof higher-order systems, and a discussion of linearity.\n1.1\nFirst-order systems\nThe canonical1 homogeneous first-order differential equation is\ndy(t)\nτ\n+ y(t) = 0,\n(1.1)\ndt\nwhere we assume τ =\n0. The variable τ is the system time constant and\nhas units of seconds. Here we have explicitly shown the time dependence\nof y(t). It is also acceptable and more compact to use the form\nτ dy + y = 0.\n(1.2)\ndt\nThe response of a such an unforced first-order system is always of the\nform y(t) = cest . This is a simple and beautiful result, easy to remember,\nand extends to higher-order systems in a natural way. The variable s has\nunits of frequency (sec-1). The differential equation (1.1) will only allow one\nvalue of s = λ1. We call λ1 the characteristic frequency or equivalently the\neigenvalue of the system (1.1). In this first-order case, λ1 is a real number,\nbut in higher-order cases the eigenvalues are more generally complex-valued.\nThe constant c is a real number with the same units as y; it is used to set\nthe value of the function at some point in time, typically t = 0. The value\nat t = 0 is called the initial condition of the homogeneous response.\nYou can find the homogeneous solution as follows: First, substitute the\nassumed form y(t) = cest into the differential equation. The deriviative\n1prototypical\n\n1.1. FIRST-ORDER SYSTEMS\noperation just brings down a multiplicative term s, and so you have\nτsce st + ce st = 0.\n(1.3)\nThis can be factored as\n(τ s + 1)ce st = 0.\n(1.4)\nSetting the initial condition c = 0 satisfies this equation but is not very\ninteresting, since this gives y = 0 for all time. The function est is nonzero\nfor finite s and t, and thus can be divided out to give the characteristic\nequation (τs + 1) = 0. This has the solution s = λ1 = -1/τ , which is\nthe one and only characteristic frequency (eigenvalue)2 associated with this\nfirst-order system.\nThus we have arrived at the homogeneous solution\nt\ny(t) = ce- τ .\n(1.5)\nThe response decays to zero with increasing time if τ > 0; if the natural\nresponse of a system always decays to zero with increasing time for any\ninitial conditions, we say that the system is stable. If the response goes\noff to infinity with increasing time for some initial conditions, the system\nis unstable.\nThe response (1.5) has the initial value y(0) = c. The graph of this\nresponse is shown in Figure 1.1 for an initial condition c = 1 with the four\nvalues τ = 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1. As you can see, τ represents the characteristic time\nfor the response to decay toward zero; smaller values of τ correspond with\nfaster responses.\nBecause such a response is widely applicable in real engineering systems,\nwe will take a bit of time to understand it in more depth. Your efforts here to\ninternalize an understanding of this response and its characteristics will pay\ndividends throughout your engineering studies and practice. Specifically, in\nan interval of one time constant, the response shown decays to a value of\n0.37 times the value at the start of the interval. This is so because e-1 =\n0.3679 ≈ 0.37. Since this response has an initial value of 1, the response\ndecays to a value of 0.37 in one time constant, 0.372 in two time constants,\nand a value of 0.37n in n time constants. You should verify this result to\ngraphical accuracy for all four of the time constant values; they pass through\nthe dashed line y = 0.37 in an interval equal to τ. And, in 3 seconds, the\nresponse for τ = 1 sec passes through a value of 0.373 ≈ 0.05; we would\n2The terms characteristic frequency and eigenvalue are equivalent, and will be used\ninterchangeably herein.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

How\nmany time constants would it take to settle to within 1%? (You should\nbe sure you can answer this before going on.) Meanwhile, in 3 seconds,\nthe τ = 0.1 sec response has passed through 30 time constants, and has a\nvalue of e-30 = 9.4 × 10-14 . This is pretty close to zero, but in theory the\nresponse never quite gets to zero, no matter how long you wait; it just keeps\ndecaying by further factors of 0.37.\nSo we see that the eigenvalue captures the time-scale of the first-order\nresponse. This idea extends to the higher-order systems considered later. In\nthese more general cases, the eigenvalues may have imaginary components;\nin the first-order case considered above they are pure real. Because of the\nprimary importance of the eigenvalues of a system, it is common in prac\ntice to graphically plot the eigenvalue locations on a plane with horizontal\naxis Re{s}, and vertical axis Im{s}. This complex plane is referred to as\nthe s-plane, and the eigenvalue locations are called poles. For example, in\nthe first-order system considered above, the eigenvalue is λ1 = -1/τ ; this\nsystem is thus also said to have a pole at s = λ1 = -1/τ. In the complex\nplane, poles are plotted as x's; for the first-order system, the pole diagram\n\n1.1.

Arrow\nindicates the direction of decreasing τ.\nappears as shown in Figure 1.2. Decreasing values of τ result in the pole\nmoving to the left along the negative real axis. Thus, faster systems have\npoles located further from the origin in the s-plane.\nA differential equation of the form (1.1) occurs as the mathematical\nmodel for systems of many different physical principles. In the sections\nbelow, we show the process of modeling first-order systems from the me\nchanical, electrical, thermal, and fluidic domains. In these domains, ho\nmogeneous responses such as shown in Figure 1.1 occur with a variety of\nassociated physical units. The beauty of system theory is first that it is\nfound to be applicable to many classes of real-world systems, and secondly\nthat we can thereby understand these systems from a common mathematical\nframework.\n\nCHAPTER 1. NATURAL RESPONSE\nFigure 1.3: Picture of mechanical system which can be modeled as first-\norder.\n1.1.1\nMechanical translational first-order system\nConsider the mechanical system shown in the picture of Figure 1.3 as used\nin Lab 1. This consists of a spring-steel beam rigidly fixed at one end, and\nattached to an air cylinder damper on the other end. We will consider this\nas a translational system, with the point of translation corresponding to the\nnearly straight line motion of the end of the beam where it joins the air\npiston damper. The air piston damper3 consists of a graphite piston sliding\nin a precisely fit glass cylinder as shown in Figure 1.4. The knob at the near\nend controls an adjustable orifice to set the resistance to flow in and out of\nthe damper, and thereby set the damping coefficient.\nFigure 1.5 shows experimental data taken from this system via videotap\ning at 20 frames per second, as well as data from a model adjusted to match\nthis response. The measured data points are shown in blue, with asterisks\nat the data points taken every 1/20th of a second. The red curve is a plot\nof the first-order response (1.5) with the parameters adjusted to reasonably\n3Also known as an Airpot, which is a trademark of the Airpot Corporation, Norwalk,\nCT.\n\n1.1. FIRST-ORDER SYSTEMS\nFigure 1.4: Picture of air piston damper.\nfit the data. The fitted model response is\ny(t) = 1.5 × 10-2 e-1.65t [m],\n(1.6)\nand thus the time constant is τ = 1/1.65 = 0.61 sec. The initial condition\nis c = 1.5 cm.\nThe first-order model (1.5) fits this response very well. The experimental\ndata is a bit noisy as might be expected. The primary noise source is that\nthe video camera frame rate is not very constant. This could be improved\nwith better video hardware, but is not important for this experiment.\nThe simplest lumped mechanical model which fits this response is the\nfirst-order mechanical spring-damper system shown in Figure 1.6. Here we\nassume that the link can only move in the x-direction. The cantilever beam\nacts as a spring which is linear for moderate deflections. The spring con\nstant k for this beam can be calculated from first principles. With this\ncalculated spring constant we can compute the damping coefficient equiva\nlent b for the air piston damper.\nAs shown in the figure, the system consists of a spring and damper\nattached to a rigid massless link. The link represents the connection between\nthe spring and damper, but contributes no dynamics of its own. The position\nof the link is denoted as x. The zero of position is indicated in the figure\nby the vertical line connecting to the arrow which indicates the direction\n\nCHAPTER 1.

This choice of zero accounts for the rest position (zero\nforce length) of the spring. The spring is moved by a force proportional to\nmotion in the x-direction, Fk = kx. The damper is moved by a force which\nis proportional to velocity in the x-direction, Fb = b dx/dt.\nNewton's second law states that F = ma = mx , where F is the sum of\nthe forces acting on a mass. This relationship also applies to the massless\nlink, but since the link is massless, the forces must instantaneously sum to\nzero. For any mass element, or massless assembly from a system, Newton's\nsecond law can be captured in the form of a free-body diagram. For this\nsystem the free-body diagram appears as shown in Figure 1.7.\nSumming forces acting on the link and applying Newton's second law\nyields the system equation of motion\ndx\n-Fk - Fb = -kx - b\n= 0.\n(1.7)\ndt\nThe minus signs appear here for the forces Fk and Fb since they act on the\nlink in the -x-direction. The zero term on the right is due to the fact that\nthe link is massless. The governing differential equation can be rewritten as\nb dx + x = 0,\n(1.8)\nk dt\nIf we define τ = b/k, this is in the form of (1.1).

Models\nof greater complexity could be readily justified for the beam air pot system\nif it were studied in more depth. For example, the distributed mass and\ncompliance of the beam would lead to the existence of vibratory modes on\nthe beam itself. These modes would require a high dimensional or infinite\ndimensional model that could more accurately capture some of the transient\nbehavior of the beam. Further, we have ignored the compressibility of the\nair in the cylinder of the damper. With finite compressibility, the air pot\nis a thermodynamic system in that the temperature of the air contained\nwithin the cylinder is a reflection of the work done on the air by the piston,\nas well as inputs/losses of heat from the outside world. Such considerations\nare important to understand the behavior in many cases, but are well out\nside the scope of topics for this text. You need to study fundamentals of\nthermodynamics to fully understand this issue.\nMeanwhile, within the right range of time scales and accuracy require\nments, a simple first order lumped model well-captures the dominant dy\n\n1.1.

For information on expanding models to include such addi\ntional detailed effects, in this and many other systems, take a look at the\nMaster's thesis of Katie Lilienkamp [1]. In particular, the beam/air-piston\nsystem is treated in great detail in section 3.3 of this reference.\n1.1.2\nMechanical rotational first-order system\nConsider the mechanical rotational system shown in the picture of Fig\nure 1.8. This system is described in more detail on the Activlab pages\nunder the heading of Lab 2; you can see a video of it in motion on these\npages. This system consists of a shaft rotating about a vertical axis. The\naxis of rotation is constrained by a pair of air bearings, which use pressurized\nair to create a nearly-frictionless rotational/translational bearing. Since the\nair bearings do not constrain axial motion, the shaft rests on a ball bearing\nresting on a hardened flat. This ball-on-flat acts as the axial bearing for the\nsystem. If the rotational axis is properly aligned perpendicular to the flat,\nthen this axial bearing exhibits very little friction.\nThe rotating shaft carries a brass flywheel which serves as an additional\nrotational inertia. This flywheel can be placed on the hub to increase the\ninertia, or removed to decrease the inertia. Figure 1.9 shows the brass\n\nCHAPTER 1. NATURAL RESPONSE\nFigure 1.9: Picture of brass flywheel being placed on top of shaft of rotational\nsystem.\nflywheel being put in place on the top of the hub.\nA line drawing of the system is shown in Figure 1.10. Here we can\nobserve the shaft located in the air bearings. The axis of rotation is vertical\nin this figure. At the top of the shaft is the flywheel hub which is shown\nwith the brass weight removed. At the bottom of the shaft there is a cup\nfilled with a viscous liquid. In the present case this liquid is honey. More\ndetail of the bottom end of the shaft is shown in Figure 1.11. Here you can\nsee the ball bearing which is mounted on to the end of the shaft and rotates\nwith the shaft. The ball bearing rests on the hardened flat shown at the\nbottom of the figure. Honey is filled within the chamber to a depth L and\nhas an annular thickness t.\nFigure 1.12 shows experimental data taken from this system. The re\nsponse shown in the figure looks reasonably modeled as first-order. At the\nlevel of modeling that we require, we can then think of this system as com\nposed of a rotational inertia spinning on a rotational damper a shown in\nFigure 1.13.\nThe rotational equivalent of Newton's second law is ! τ = Jω . The\nonly torque acting on the inertia is due to the the viscous drag of the rota\ntional damper τ = -bω. Summing torques acting on the inertia yields the\n\n1.1.

This allows us\nto give the estimated velocity as a function of time as\nω(t) = 85e-t/0.1 rad/sec.\n(1.19)\nAt this point we could develop a calculation of the rotational system inertia\nfrom first principles. If we know the rotational inertia of this system, we\ncan then use the time constant result τ = J/b to calculate the equivalent\nrotational damping. Alternately, we could experimentally measure the rota\ntional damping and thereby develop an estimate of the rotational inertia J.\n\nCHAPTER 1. NATURAL RESPONSE\nvc\nvr\nic\nir\nC\nR\n+\n+\nFigure 1.14: First-order parallel RC circuit diagram.\n1.1.3\nElectrical first-order system\nThe circuit shown in Figure 1.14 is a parallel RC circuit which can be de\nscribed by a first order differential equation. The formulation of the differ\nential equation goes as follows. First we need to account for each of the\nnetwork elements. The resistor has a current-voltage relationship described\nby Ohm's law vr = irR. The capacitor has a current-voltage relationship\ngiven by ic = C dvc\ndt .\nThe currents ir and ic must be equal and opposite so that their sum is\nequal to zero, since current cannot accumulate at their common node. That\nis, we must have\n0 = ir + ic = vr + C dvc .\n(1.20)\nR\ndt\nRecognize further that since the two elements are connected in parallel,\ntheir voltages must be equal: vr = vc. You substitute this into (1.20), and\nmultiply through by R to find\nRC dvc + vc = 0.\n(1.21)\ndt\nIf we define τ = RC, this is in the form of (1.1). The natural response is\nthus as calculated in section 1.1, with its associated figures. Specifically, if\nthe initial voltage on the capacitor is defined as vc(0) = v0, then the voltage\nas a function of time varies as\nvc(t) = v0e-t/RC [Volts].\n(1.22)\nFor example, suppose that we set C = 100 μF and R = 1 MΩ. Then the\ntime constant is τ = 100 sec; it will take the capacitor voltage 100 seconds\nto decay to 37% of its initial value.\n\n1.1. FIRST-ORDER SYSTEMS\nFigure 1.15: Sketch of bulb and relevant thermal elements.\n1.1.4\nThermal first-order system\nFor an example thermal system we study the desk lamp shown in the picture\n(to be added). This lamp bulb is electrically heated via the bulb filament.\nThe resulting bulb temperature is measured with the infrared sensor shown\nin the figure (to be added). A sketch of the light bulb in the lamp is shown\nin the line drawing of Figure 1.15.\nWe left the lamp on for a long enough time to reach steady state, and\nthen turned off the lamp and measured the decay of temperature back to\nambient. Data taken from this system is shown in tabular and graphical\nform in Figure 1.16 By inspection of this data, the bulb system is well-fit\nby a first-order model of the form of (1.1). An estimate of the associated\ntime constant is about 3 minutes. But we need to have τ in seconds, so the\nsystem time constant is formally given as τ = 180 sec.\nAn abstraction to a lumped model of this system is shown in Figure 1.17.\nHere the thermal capacitance of the bulb is summarized by the block of\nmaterial labeled with the capacitance Cb with units of [J/*K]. The block\nis assumed to have a uniform temperature Tb [*K]. This block has a total\nstored thermal energy Wb = CbTb [J].

The natural response is\nthus as calculated in section 1.1, with its associated figures. Specifically, if\nthe initial temperature difference of the bulb is defined as T (0) = T0, then\nthe temperature difference as a function of time varies as\nT (t) = T0e-t/RbCb [K].\n(1.27)\nIf you want to convert back to the absolute temperature of the bulb, re\nmember that Tb = T + Ta.\n1.1.5\nFluidic first-order system\nA fluidic system which can be modeled with a first-order differential equation\nis shown in Figure 1.18.

The response of this system to\nan initial displacement x(0) = x0 and initial velocity v(0) = x (0) = v0\nis found in a manner identical to that previously used in the first order\ncase of Section 1.1. That is, assume that x(t) takes the form x(t) = cest .\nSubstituting this function into (1.33) and applying the derivative property\nof the exponential yields\nms 2 ce st + bscest + kcest = 0.\n(1.34)\nAs before, the common factor cest may be cancelled, since it is nonzero\nfor any finite s and t, and with non-rest (c = 0) initial conditions. Thus we\n\nfind that s must satisfy the characteristic equation ms2 + bs + k = 0. This\nsecond-order polynomial has two solutions\nb\n√\nb2 - 4mk\ns1 = -2m +\n2m\n(1.35)\nand\nb\n√\nb2 - 4mk\ns2 = -2m -\n2m\n(1.36)\nwhich are the pole locations (natural frequencies) of the system.\n\nCHAPTER 1. NATURAL RESPONSE\nIn most cases, the poles are distinct (b2 = 4\n\nmk), and the initial condition\nresponse will take the form\nx(t) = c1e s1t + c2e s2t\n(1.37)\nwhere s1 and s2 are given above, and the two constants c1 and c2 are chosen\nto satisfy the initial conditions x0 and v0. If the roots are real (b2 > 4mk),\nthen the response is the weighted sum of two real exponentials. If the\nroots have an imaginary component (b2 < 4mk), then the exponentials are\ncomplex and the response has an oscillatory component. Since in this case\ns1 = s2\n∗, in order to have a real response it must hold that c1 = c2\n∗, and\nthus the response can be expressed as x(t) = 2Re{c1es1t}, or equivalently as\nx(t) = 2Re{c2es2t}.\nIn the case that the poles are coincident (b2 = 4mk), we have s1 = s2,\nand the initial condition response will take the form\nx(t) = c1e s1t + c2tes1t\n(1.38)\nAs before, the two constants c1 and c2 are chosen to satisfy the initial con\nditions x0 and v0.\nBefore further analysis, it is helpful to introduce some standard terms.\nThe pole locations are conveniently parameterized in terms of the damping\nratio ζ, and natural frequency ωn, where\n!\nk\n(1.40)\nωn =\nm\n(1.39)\nand\nb\nζ =\n.\n√\nkm\nThe natural frequency ωn is the frequency at which the system would\noscillate if the damping b were zero. The damping ratio ζ is the ratio of the\nactual damping b to the critical damping bc = 2\n√\nkm. You should see that\nthe critical damping value is the value for which the poles are coincident.\nIn terms of these parameters, the differential equation (1.33) takes the\nform\n1 d 2x\n2ζ dx\n+\n+ x = 0.\n(1.41)\nω2 dt2\nωn dt\nn\nIn the following section we will make the physically reasonable assump\ntion that the values of m, and k are greater than zero (to maintain system\norder) and that b is non-negative (to keep things stable). With these as\nsumptions, there are four classes of pole locations:\n\n1.2. SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\n- First, if b = 0, the poles are complex conjugates on the imaginary axis\nat s1 = +j\n\"\nk/m and s2 = -j\n\"\nk/m. This corresponds to ζ = 0, and\nis referred to as the undamped case.\nIf b2 - 4mk < 0 then the poles are complex conjugates lying in the left\n-\nhalf of the s-plane. This corresponds to the range 0 < ζ < 1, and is\nreferred to as the underdamped case.\nIf b2 - 4mk = 0 then the poles coincide on the real axis at s1 = s2 =\n-\n-b/2m. This corresponds to ζ = 1, and is referred to as the critically\ndamped case.\nFinally, if b2 - 4mk > 0 then the poles are at distinct locations on the\n-\nreal axis in the left half of the s-plane. This corresponds to ζ > 1, and\nis referred to as the overdamped case.\nWe examine each of these cases in turn below.\n1.2.3\nUndamped case (ζ = 0)\nIn this case, the poles lie at s1 = jωn and s2 = -jωn. These pole locations\nare plotted on the s-plane in Figure 1.21.\nThe homogeneous solution takes the form x(t) = c1es1t+c2es2t = c1ejωnt+\nc2e-jωnt . In order for this solution to be real, we must have c1 = c∗\n2, and\nthus this simplifies to\nx(t) = 2Re{c1ejωnt}.\n(1.42)\nIf we define c1 = α + jβ then this becomes\nx(t) = 2Re{(α + jβ)ejωnt}\n(1.43)\n= 2Re{(α + jβ)(cos ωnt + j sin ωnt)}\n(1.44)\n= 2(α cos ωnt - β sin ωnt).\n(1.45)\nThe constants α and β in this solution can be used to match specified\nvalues of the initial conditions on position x0 and velocity v0. By inspection,\nwe have x(0) = 2α, and thus to match a specified initial position, α = x0/2.\nTaking the derivative yields x (0) = -2βωn, and thus to match a specified\ninitial velocity, we must have β = -v0/2ωn.\nYou should not try to memorize this result; rather, internalize the prin\nciple which allowed this solution to be readily derived: (possibly complex)\nexponentials are the natural response of linear time invariant systems.\n\nCHAPTER 1. NATURAL RESPONSE\nIm{s}\nX !n\nRe{s}\nX !n\nFigure 1.21: Pole locations in the s-plane for second-order mechanical system\nin the undamped case (ζ = 0).\n\n1.2. SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\nTo show things in another light, suppose that we rewrite the constant c1\ninto polar form as c1 = Mejφ , with M = |c1| =\n\"\nα2 + β2 and φ =\narg{c1} = arctan2(α, β).\nBy the notation arctan2, we mean the two-\nargument arctangent function which unambiguously returns the angle as\nsociated with a complex number, when given the real and imaginary com\nponents of that number. Using a single argument arctangent function in\ntroduces an uncertainty of π radians into the returned angle φ; be sure to\nuse two-argument arctangent functions in any numerical algorithms that\nyou write. On your calculator, this problem can be avoided by using the\nrectangular-to-polar conversion function.\nWith c1 represented in polar form, the homogeneous response can be\nwritten as\nx(t) = 2Re{Mejφ ejωnt}\n(1.46)\n=\n2MRe{ej(ωnt+φ)}\n(1.47)\n=\n2M cos(ωnt + φ).\n(1.48)\nThe mathematics is notationally cleaner this way, and this more compact\nform makes clear that the natural reponse in the undamped case (ζ = 0) is\na constant-amplitude sinusoid of frequency ωn, in which the amplitude M\nand phase shift φ are adjustable to match initial conditions. Note that the\nsolution we have derived is valid for all time; in the most general case, the\nvalue of the solution in position and velocity could be specified at any given\npoint in time, and the solution constants adjusted to match this constraint.\nA picture of this response is shown in Figure 1.22 to make clear the\neffect of the amplitude and phase parameters; in this figure we have chosen\nM = 3 (and thus a peak value of 2M = 6) and φ = π/4. The period\nof oscillation is T = 2π/ωn; the plot is shown for ωn = 1. We have also\nplotted for reference a unit-amplitude cosine with zero phase shift. Note\nthat positive phase shift corresponds with a forward shift in time in the\namount ∆t = (φ/2π)T .\nFor the form of the response (1.48) the position at t = 0 is x(0) =\n2M cos φ, and the velocity at t = 0 is v(0) = -2Mωn sin φ. For the\nparameter values used in the plot, we then have x(0) = 4.24 [m], and\nv(0) = -4.24 [m/sec]. You should check that to graphical accuracy, you\ncan see these values on the plot of Figure 1.22.\nIn practice it is rare to find a system with truly zero damping, as this\ncorresponds to zero energy loss despite the continuing oscillation. Mechan\nical systems in vacuum can exhibit nearly lossless behavior. It is fortunate\nfor us that the orbits of planets around a star like our sun are nearly lossless.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

A reference unit amplitude cosine is also shown.\n\n1.2. SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\nAs a further example, precession and nutation motions of the planets or a\nspin-stabilized satellite are very close to zero loss. Attitude vibrations of\na gravity gradient stabilized satellite are nearly lossless. Micromechanical\noscillators in vaccum have nearly zero loss, but their free responses do die\nout in finite time due to internal dissipation in the constituent materials.\nLarge structures in space (for example solar panels on the Hubble telescope\nor the main structure of the space station currently in orbit) can exhibit\nnegligible loss, and might well be modeled as having zero damping for many\npurposes.\nSo the case we've just studied is idealized, and hard to find in prac\ntice. However, with feedback control (to be studied later), it is possible to\nforce a system to net zero loss by providing a driving signal which keeps an\noscillation at constant amplitude.\nThe more typical case is that of finite damping, as studied in the next\nsection. The mathematics with finite damping is slightly more complicated,\nso keep in mind the overall approach we've just followed in the zero damping\ncase. The approach is essentially the same with finite damping; just keep\nsaying to yourself \"complex exponentials are my friend...\"\n1.2.4\nUnderdamped case (0 < ζ < 1)\nNow we turn attention to solving for the underdamped homogeneous re\nsponse. Once again, this second-order system has initial conditions given by\nan initial displacement x(0) = x0 and initial velocity v(0) = x (0) = v0. The\nnatural response takes the form as given earlier in (1.37)\nx(t) = c1e s1t + c2e s2t .\n(1.49)\nSince we are considering the underdamped case, then b2 < 4mk, and the\nroots given by (1.35, 1.36) become\ns1 = - b\n2m + j\n√\n4mk - b2\n2m\n(1.50)\n≡ -σ + jωd\nand\ns2 = - b\n2m - j\n√\n4mk - b2\n2m\n(1.51)\n≡ -σ - jωd.\nThat is, the poles lie at s = -σ ± jωd, where\nσ = ζωn\n(1.52)\n\nCHAPTER 1.

These pole locations are plotted on the s-\nplane in Figure 1.23. As shown in the figure, the poles are at a radius from\nthe origin of ωn and at an angle from the imaginary axis of θ = sin-1 ζ.\nThe figure also shows the effect of increasing ζ and ωn. As ζ increases from\n0 to 1, the poles move along an arc of radius ωn from θ = 0 to θ = π/2.\nAs ωn increases, the poles move radially away from the origin, maintaining\nconstant angle θ = sin-1 ζ, and thus constant damping ratio.\nTo be more specific, the effect of ζ is shown in Figure 1.24 as ζ takes on\nthe values ζ = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.8, and 1.0 for a system with ωn = 1.\nNow for the details of developing a solution which meets given initial\nconditions. Since we have s1 = s∗\n2, the solution (1.49) will be real if c1 = c∗\n2.\n\n1.2.

NATURAL RESPONSE\nWith this constraint, as before, the solution simplifies to\nx(t) = 2Re{c1e(-σ+jωd)t}.\n(1.54)\nAs before, we define c1 = α + jβ; then the response becomes\nx(t) = 2Re{(α + jβ)e(-σ+jωd)t}\n(1.55)\n=\n2e-σtRe{(α + jβ)(cos ωdt + j sin ωdt)}\n(1.56)\n=\n2e-σt(α cos ωdt - β sin ωdt).\n(1.57)\nThe position at t = 0 is given by x0 = 2α, and thus to match a specified\nx0 we require\nα = x\n0 .\n(1.58)\nTaking the derivative with respect to time gives the velocity as\nx (t) = -2σe-σt(α cos ωdt - β sin ωdt) + 2e-σt(-αωd sin ωdt - βωd cos ωdt)\n(1.59)\nCollecting terms gives\nx (t) = 2e-σt ((-σα - βωd) cos ωdt + (σβ - αωd) sin ωdt) ,\n(1.60)\nand thus the initial velocity is\nv0 = x (0) = 2(-σα - βωd)\n(1.61)\nSubstituting in the earlier result α = x0/2 gives\nv0 = 2(- σ\nx0 - βωd)\n(1.62)\nand thus we can solve for β as\nβ = -(v0\n+\nω\nσ\nd\nx0)\n(1.63)\nAlternately, the initial condition constant can be expressed in polar no\ntation as we did in the undamped case. That is, let c1 = Mejφ , with\nM = |c1| =\n\"\nα2 + β2 and φ = arg{c1} = arctan2(α, β). With c1 rep\nresented in polar form, the underdamped homogeneous response can be\nwritten as\nx(t) = 2Re{Mejφ e(-σ+jωd)t}\n(1.64)\n=\n2Me-σtRe{ej(ωdt+φ)}\n(1.65)\n=\n2Me-σt cos(ωdt + φ).\n(1.66)\n\n1.2. SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\nThis more compact form may be more suitable for some analyses, and is\nalso more helpful when hand-sketching this waveform.\nTo make things specific, consider the response to initial position x0 = 0\nand initial velocity v0 = 1.5 This yields the values α = 0 and β = -1/2ωd.\nThe polar representation is thus M = 1/2ωd and φ = -π/2. Substituting\ninto either form of the homogeneous solution (1.57, 1.66) gives the response\nas\nx(t) =\ne-σt sin ωdt.\n(1.67)\nωd\nNote that this solution is valid for all time, and satisfies the initial conditions\nimposed at t = 0.\nThe reason for previously defining σ and ωd is now more clear since the\ntime response is naturally expressed in terms of these variables. Note that\nsince both σ and ωd scale linearly with ωn, the response characteristic time-\nscale decreases as 1/ωn. Also note that for a constant initial velocity, the\nresponse amplitude decreases with ωn. This is so because assuming that m\nis a fixed value, increasing ωn while holding ζ constant requires increasing\nthe values of both k and b. Thus, the mass with initial velocity 1 \"runs into\"\na stiffer system, and is returned to rest more rapidly.\nThis is shown in Figure 1.25 where the response for four values ωn =\n10, 20, 50, 100 is shown with damping ratio held constant at ζ = 0.2. Note\nthat the initial slope of each of the four responses is identical and equal to 1\nwhich, of course, is the initial velocity specified above. The point to retain\nfrom Figure 1.25 is that ωn sets the response time scale with larger values\nof ωn corresponding to faster time scales.\nViewed another way, the response can be plotted on axes normalized to\nt′ = ωnt; this response will then only depend upon the value of ζ, which\ndetermines the relative damping . With time normalized as above, the\neffect of varying values of ζ = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9 is shown in the plot of the\ninitial condition response (1.67) in Figure 1.26. In this response, the term\nsin ωdt provides the oscillatory part. Multiplying by the term e-σt yields\nthe decaying exponential amplitude on the oscillation seen in the figure. As\nshown in the figure, as ζ (and thus σ) approaches zero the response becomes\nmore lightly damped, due to the fact that the exponential envelope decays\nmore slowly.\nThe effect of the parameters k, b, and m can also be understood in\nterms of the s-plane pole locations, as shown in Figure 1.27. Referring to\n5This initial condition can be established by an impulse in force Fc of area equal to\nm N-sec.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

This effect is shown by the arrows\nin Figure 1.27 which indicate that the poles move vertically away from the\norigin with increasing k while maintaining constant real parts.\nThus with increasing k the system natural frequency increases while the\ndamping ratio decreases. Since the real part of the poles remains unchanged\n(σ stays constant), the decay-rate of the response remains unchanged. This\neffect is shown in Figure 1.28 where four responses are shown for initial\nconditions x0 = 0, v0 = 1 which have constant values of m = 1 kg, b = 2 N\nsec/m. In the four figures, k takes the values k = 3, 10, 100, 1000. Note that\neach response has the same decay rate, as we have argued above. As k is\nincreased, the response amplitude decreases, since the stiffer spring turns\nthe mass around from its initial velocity in decreasing amounts of time.\nThe conclusion to be reached is that increasing k makes the system respond\nfaster, but does not affect the time required to settle to its final value.

Simply\nstiffening a structure without adding damping helps in the sense that the\namplitude response to disturbances is reduced, but does not help in the\nsense that the characteristic time required to settle is not reduced.\nReferring to equations (1.39) and (1.40) we can see that the natural\nfrequency of the poles is unaffected by the choice of damping constant b,\nand that ζ grows with increasing b. This effect is shown by the arrows in\nFigure 1.27 which indicate that the poles move toward the real axis with\nincreasing b along a circular arc of constant radius ωn from the origin. This\neffect is shown in Figure 1.29 where initial condition (x0 = 0, v0 = 1)\nresponses are shown which have constant values of m = 1 kg, k = 1 N/m, and\nthus ωn = 1. In the four figures, b takes the values b = .02, .2, .5, 2 N-sec/m.\nThe conclusion to be reached is that increasing b makes the system better\ndamped, but does not affect the natural frequency. It does, however, affect\nthe damped natural frequency. For relatively light damping, the damped\n\n1.2.

However, as\nthe poles approach the real axis, the damped natural frequency approaches\nzero, and thus is significantly different from the natural frequency which\nremains constant as b varied. The last trace in the figure shows the critically\ndamped case, in which ωd = 0 and there is thus no oscillation in the response.\nThe mass m affects all the system parameters. As m is increased, the\nnatural frequency decreases, and the damping ratio also decreases. Thus,\nas m increases, the poles move toward the origin along the arc shown in\nFigure 1.27. This effect is shown in the time-domain in Figure 1.30 where\ninitial condition (x0 = 0, v0 = 1) responses are shown which have con\nstant values of k = 1 N/m, b = 2 N-sec/m, and where m takes the values\nm = 1, 5, 50, 500 kg. The conclusion to be reached is that as the mass is in\ncreased the response characteristic time becomes longer, and simultaneously\nthe response becomes more poorly damped. Note also that the amplitude\n\nCHAPTER 1.

This effect\ndemonstrates why an overloaded car can begin to show poor suspension\nresponse.\n1.2.5\nCritically-damped case\nIn the critically damped case, ζ = 1 and the two poles coincide at s1 = s2 =\n-ωn. These pole locations are plotted on the s-plane in Figure 1.31. The\nhomogeneous solution takes the form\nx(t)\n= c1e s1t + c2tes1t\n(1.68)\n= c1e-ωnt + c2te-ωnt\n(1.69)\nwhere c1 and c2 are real numbers. (Compare this expression to the equiva\nlent result for the undamped case; these look nearly identical, but now the\nexpression is composed of pure real terms.)\n\n1.2. SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\nIn what is now a familiar theme, we use the initial condition specifications\nto set the values of the parameters c1 and c2 as follows. At t = 0, the position\nis x0 ≡ x(0) = c1; this sets the first parameter. Taking the time derivative\ngives the velocity as\nx (t)\n= -ωnc1e-ωnt + c2e-ωnt - ωntc2e-ωnt\n(1.70)\n=\n(c2 - ωnc1 - ωntc2)e-ωnt .\n(1.71)\nAt t = 0, the velocity is v0 ≡ x (0) = c2 - ωnc1. Substituting in with c1 = x0\nand rearranging gives the second parameter as c2 = v0 + ωnx0.\nTo make things specific, consider the response to an initial position x0 =\n0 and initial velocity v0 = 1. The parameters then become c1 = 0 and\nc2 = 1, and thus the homogenous response is\nx(t) = te-ωnt .\n(1.72)\nYou've already seen a plot of this response with ωn = 1 in the last panel\nof Figure 1.29, and the first panel of Figure 1.30. Take a look at these\nagain. For a given ωn this is the fastest natural response which exhibits no\novershoot as it returns to zero. For this reason, mechanisms and control\nsystems are sometimes tuned for critical damping, or to be only slightly\nunderdamped as it is desirable to have a system which responds quickly,\nbut with little or no overshoot.\n1.2.6\nOverdamped case\nIn both the critically damped case and the overdamped case, the description\nof the pole locations in terms of ζ and ωn, while mathematically consistent,\nis not of as great utility as in the underdamped case. Since the poles are real\nfor ζ ≥ 1, they can most readily be described in terms of their time constants\nand viewed as two separate first-order systems. However, for purposes of\nunderstanding, we continue the description in terms of the second-order\nparameters.\nIn the overdamped case, ζ > 1 and the two poles are at separate locations\non the real axis: s1 = -(ζ -\n\"\nζ2 - 1)ωn and s2 = -(ζ +\n\"\nζ2 - 1)ωn. These\npole locations are plotted on the s-plane in Figure 1.32. Note that |s2| > |s1|,\nand thus the pole at s1 is closer to the origin in the s-plane than s2. In the\nlimit as ζ approaches infinity, the root s1 will approach the origin, while the\nroot s2 approaches infinity.6\n6As another way of looking at things, it is interesting to note that if the mass m\n\nCHAPTER 1.

SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\nThe homogeneous solution takes the familiar form\nx(t)\n= c1e s1t + c2e s2t\n(1.73)\n= c1e-(ζ-√\nζ2-1)ωnt + c2e-(ζ+√\nζ2-1)ωnt\n(1.74)\nwhere c1 and c2 are real numbers.\nWe use the initial condition specifications to set the values of the pa\nrameters c1 and c2 as follows. At t = 0, the position is x0 ≡ x(0) = c1 + c2.\nTaking the time derivative in (1.73) gives the velocity as\nx (t) = c1s1e s1t + c2s2e s2t .\n(1.75)\nAt t = 0, the velocity is v0 ≡ x (0) = c1s1 + c2s2. Substituting in with\nc2 = x0 - c1 and rearranging gives\nv0 + x0s2\ns2 - s1\nc1 = s2 - s1\n,\n(1.76)\nand\nc2 = -\n.\nv0 + x0s1\n(1.77)\nTo make things specific, consider the response to an initial position x0 =\n0 and initial velocity v0 = 1. With these initial conditions, the parameters\nbecome c1 = -c2 = 1/(s2 - s1) = 1/(2ωn\n\"\nζ2 - 1). The response is thus\ngiven by\nx(t) =\n2ωn\n\"1\nζ2 - 1\n#\ne s1t - e s2t$\n,\n(1.78)\nvalid for all time. Plots of this response for ωn = 1 and ζ = 1, 2, 5, 10 are\nshown in Figure 1.33.\nNote that the response for large ζ is approximately first-order with a\ntime constant of -1/s1. This happens because the exponential with the\nlarger pole magnitude decays more quickly than the exponential with the\nsmaller pole magnitude. Thus we see that for stable systems, poles with\nsmaller real part magnitude in the s-plane dominate the time response. As\na practical matter, we can ignore in the time response any poles with real\nparts greater than a factor of 5-10 larger in magnitude than the magnitude\nof the real part of the dominant poles. Of course, any unstable poles can\nnever be ignored, no matter how far they are from the origin, since their\nnatural response grows exponentially with time.\nis allowed to approach zero, and the limits on s1 and s2 are properly taken, then s1\napproaches the value -k/b, and s2 approaches infinity. Thus the second-order system in\nthis limit of zero mass properly devolves to the first order case studied in Section 1.1.1.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\n1.2.7\nCanonical second-order form\nThe results of the previous section are generalizable to other systems which\ncan be modeled with second-order linear constant coefficient differential\nequations.

Then the types of responses plotted in the previous sec\ntions for the mechanical system will be directly applicable to many types\nof physical systems including electrical, thermal, and fluidic as described in\nthe next few sections.\nWe will also find it helpful to collect here for reference the definition\nof the real and imaginary parts of the poles.

Again, these results are applicable to any\nsystem which can be expressed in the form (1.79).\nThe natural frequency ωn determines the time-scale of the response; we\nwill assume without loss of generality that ωn > 0. Then the damping ratio\nζ determines much of the character of the natural response:\n- If ζ < 0, then such a second-order system is unstable in that the\nnatural response grows in time without bound.\n- If ζ = 0, then such a second-order system is marginally stable in that\nthe natural response is of constant amplitude in time.

The solution techniques and graphs of response from the discussion\nof the second-order mechanical system in Section 1.2.2 are thus applicable,\nand the modeling portion of this problem is complete.\n1.2.9\nThermal second-order system\nWe previously studied the temperature variation of a light bulb with a first-\norder model of bulb temperature. To gain additional insight, suppose we also\ninclude a model of the filament temperature inside the bulb. This requires\nadding an additional thermal capacitance Cf with its own temperature Tf\nto represent the filament heat energy storage and temperature, respectively.\nThese elements augment the model which previously only accounted for the\ntemperature on the outside of the bulb Tb and associated thermal capaci\ntance Cb.\nWe take some liberties here with the 4th power radiative heat transfer\nrelationship and assume that heat flow from the filament to the bulb can\nbe represented by the linear thermal resistance Rf . This is a significant\nsimplification, in that the filament temperature in a typical incandescent\nbulb might be on the order of 2500 *C. At this temperature, and given\nthat the filament operates in a vacuum inside the glass envelope, essentially\nall of the heat transfer from the filament takes place via radiation, and\nthus depends upon the temperature difference to the 4th power. Therefore\nthe heat transfer will be strongly nonlinear with filament temperature. To\nmodel this in detail, we would need to include this nonlinear thermal resis\ntance in the model differential equation, and use some nonlinear analysis or\nsimulation technique to find the solution. We will revisit this problem in\nlater sections of these notes after introducing techniques for analyzing and\nsimulating nonlinear systems.\nEven with the limitations discussed above, it is still useful to postulate\na linear heat transfer mechanism from the filament to the bulb envelope\nwhich can be represented by a linear thermal resistance Rf . This will allow\nus to gain insight into the rapid time variation associated with the filament\ntemperature when a bulb is turned on or off, and see how this fast time\nconstant couples to the relatively slow thermal time constant associated\nwith the envelope temperature equilibration.\n\n1.2.

NATURAL RESPONSE\nNote that the heat flow into the system is from electrical heating of the\nfilament. In steady-state, this heat flows through the thermal resistances,\nand finally out into the ambient temperature environment, which is assumed\nto have a constant temperature Ta independent of any heat flow value.\nThe thermal capacitances Cf and Cb represent heat storage in the fila\nment and bulb envelope, respectively. These have units of [ *J\nK ]. The thermal\nresistances Rf and Rb represent the heat-flow connections between the fil\nament/envelope and envelope/ambient, respectively. These have units of\n[\n*\nW\nC ]. The heat flows qf and qb represent the power flow in [W ] through the\nthermal resistances.\nThe constitutive relations for the elements are given as follows. For the\nthermal capacitances, we have\ndT\nC\n= q\ndt\nwhere T is the temperature of the capacitance element, and q is the heat\nflow into the capacitance. The the thermal resistances, we have\n∆T = qR\nwhere ∆T is temperature drop across resistance and qR is heat flow through\nresistance in the defined direction of temperature drop.\nTo solve thermal problems, we will sum heat flows at the thermal capac\nitances. At the two thermal capacitances this yields:\ndTf\nCf\n=\ndt\nqin - qf\ndTb\nCb\n= qf - qb\ndt\nNote carefully how the sign convention has been observed for the heat flows\nwith respect to the reference directions defined in Figure 1.35.\nNow the constitutive relationships for the resistors give\nqf\n=\n(Tf - Tb)\nRf\nqb =\n(Tb - Ta).\nRb\nCombining these with the earlier pair of equations yields\ndTf\nCf dt\n= -Rf\n(Tf - Tb) + qin\n(1.84)\ndTb\nCb dt\n= Rf\n(Tf - Tb) - Rb\n(Tb - Ta)\n(1.85)\n\n1.2. SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\nEquations (1.84) and (1.85) give a state-space model of the system. The\nstate variables are the two temperatures Tf and Tb which represent storage\nof heat energy in the system. This form of model can be solved directly\nto find the initial condition response of the system given the initial values\nTf (0) and Tb(0); this model form can also be used to solve for the driven\nresponse when we consider the filament heating qin as an input.\nWe will discuss state-space models in later sections of these notes. For the\npresent, we will solve the response of this system using classical techniques.\nTo take this classical approach, we need to transform (1.84) and (1.85)) into\na single 2nd order differential equation. This representation can then be\nsolved with the techniques presented in this chapter.\nIn order to transform (1.84) and (1.85) into a second-order ODE, we need\nto choose a single variable to represent the system and then write a second-\norder ODE in this variable. Let's focus on the bulb envelope temperature,\nTb. Thus, we need to eliminate Tf from (1.84) and (1.85).\nTo facilitate this, it is helpful to introduce operator notation. That is,\nthe operator D represents differentiation\ndf(t)\nDf(t) ≜\ndt = f′(t)\nD2f(t) ≜ d2f(t)\ndt\n= f′′(t)\nand so forth.\nWith this notation and some rearranging, equation (1.84) becomes\n(Rf Cf D + 1)Tf = Tb + Rf qin.\nTaking the inverse operation (Rf Cf D + 1)-1 on both sides gives\nTf = (Rf Cf D + 1)-1(Tb + Rf qin).\nSubstitution of this result into (1.85) yields\n[RbCbD + 1 + R\nR\nf\nb - R\nR\nf\nb (Rf Cf D + 1)-1]Tb = Rb(Rf Cf D + 1)-1 qin + Ta.\nNow we multiply through by the operator (Rf Cf D + 1) to give\n[(RbCbD + 1 + Rb )(Rf Cf D + 1) - Rb ]Tb = Rbqin + (Rf Cf D + 1)Ta,\nRf\nRf\nand thus\n[RbCbRf Cf D2+(Rf + Rb)Cf D + RbCbD + 1]Tb = Rbqin + (Rf Cf D + 1)Ta.\n\nCHAPTER 1. NATURAL RESPONSE\nNext we convert back into explicit differential equation form to give a 2nd\norder differential equation\nd2Tb\ndTb\ndTa\nRbCbRf Cf\n+ ((Rf + Rb)Cf + RbCb)\n+ Tb = Rbqin + Rf Cf\n+ Ta\ndt2\ndt\ndt\nwhere qin, dTa/dt, and Ta are inputs.\nFor the purposes of this problem we will view the ambient temperature\nas a constant, and thus dTa/dt = 0. Further, it is useful to define the\ntemperature difference T ≜ Tb - Ta. With these definitions\ndTa = 0\ndt\nand thus\ndT\ndTb\n=\ndt\ndt\nand\nd2T\nd2Tb\n=\n.\ndt2\ndt2\nWith dTa/dt = 0, and rewriting in terms of T , we have\nd2T\ndT\nRbCbRf Cf\n+ ((Rf + Rb)Cf + RbCb)\n+ T = Rbqin.\ndt2\ndt\nNow suppose we set the system parameters as\nRb = 2 [*K/W ]\nRf\n= 40 [*K/W ]\nCb = 65 [J/*C]\nCf\n= 10-3 [J/*C]\n(These have been picked to reasonably fit the response of a real 60W bulb.)\nWith these parameters, note that Rf ≫ Rb, and thus the term (Rf +\nRb) ≃ Rf , and the differential equation can be written approximately as\nd2T\ndT\nRbCbRf Cf\n+ (Rf Cf + RbCb)\n+ T = Rbqin.\ndt2\ndt\nThe characteristic equation associated with this differential equation is\nRbCbRf Cf s 2 + (Rf Cf + RbCb)s + 1 = 0.\n\n1.2. SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS\nThis can be directly factored as\n(RbCbs + 1)(Rf Cf s + 1) = 0.\nshowing that the system has two real axis poles in the left half plane. (An\nexact analysis will show that that the approximation Rf ≫ Rb used above\ngives a reasonable estimate of the pole locations, and allows us to write these\npole locations in the simple form given above.) Plugging in numbers gives\nRbCb = 130 sec ≜ τb\nRf Cf\n=\n0.04 sec ≜ τf\nNotice the two widely different time constants. The long-time scale τb =\n130 sec is associated with the thermal transient on the bulb envelope. It\ntakes on the order of 5τb ≃ 10 minutes for the bulb temperature to equi\nlibriate. The short-time scale τa = 0.04 sec is associated with the thermal\ntransient of the filament. This small piece of coiled wire heats-up/cools\ndown far more rapidly than the glass bulb envelope. It takes on the order\nof 5τa = 0.2 sec for the filament temperature to equilibriate. This fits with\nour experience in watching the filament temperature collapse rapidly when\nan incandescent bulb is turned off.\nNote that this system is highly overdamped. From the approximate dif\nferential equation we can identify ωn = 1/#RbCbRf Cf and 2ζ/ωn = Rf Cf +\nRbCb. On substitution of numerical values we find that ωn = 0.44 rad/sec\nand ζ = 57. The system poles are then at\nsb = -τb\n= -7.7 × 10-3 sec-1\nsf\n= -τf\n= -25 sec-1 .\nThe natural response will thus be of the form\nτb\nτf\nT (t) = c1e\n- t\n+ c2e\n- t\nwhich can be set to match any given initial conditions by appropriate choice\nof the constants c1 and c2. This completes the modeling of the bulb thermal\nsystem with linear resistances.\n\nCHAPTER 1.

In your home you may sometimes\nhave noticed a brief banging sound in the walls at the moment when an\nopen faucet valve is closed suddenly. This water-hammer effect is due to\nthe sudden deceleration of water moving in the pipes. The situation can be\nrepresented schematically as shown in Figure 1.36.\nThe pressure tank is a fluid accumulator which can be modeled as a\nfluidic capacitance sufficiently large, in concert with the well pump and\npressure controller, to be modeled as a pressure source with a pressure of\nabout 3 × 105 Pa (6895 Pa = 1 psi). Note: Pressure in this problem is\nmeasured with respect to atmosphere.\nA long run of pipe carries the water upstairs to a shower, where flow is\ncontrolled by a valve. We will model the pipe as having a fluidic resistance,\nR, and a fluidic inertance, L. The valve will be modeled as an on/off switch.\nA schematic of this connection might appear as shown in Figure 1.37.\nThe fluidic capacitance shown represents the compliance of the pipes and\nvalve, as well as the compressibility of the water plus any entrained air. The\nflow through the pipe is q(t) [m3/sec].\n\n1.2.

This full-flow condition corresponds with the electrical equivalent\nshown in Figure 1.38 in which the electrical switch is closed to allow current\nto flow.\nThus, the initial state of the system is given by\nq(t < 0) = Ps\nR\nPc(t < 0) = 0.\nAt t = 0, the valve opens (switch closes), and the system configuration\nchanges to that shown in Figure 1.39.

With the valve initially open\n(shower flowing), and with zero valve resistance, the pressure at the valve\nat t = 0 will be equal to the ambient outside pressure. The initial valve\npressure is thus\nP (0) = Pc(0) - Ps = 0 - Ps = -Ps.\n\nCHAPTER 1. NATURAL RESPONSE\nWe also need dP (0). This comes from q(0) as follows.

The roots are thus located at:\ns1 = -107.1 + 38.5 = -68.6\ns2 = -107.1 - 38.5 = -145.6\n\n1.2.

NATURAL RESPONSE\nThus the pressure as a function of time is\nP (t) = -3.85 × 105 e-68.6t + 8.5 × 104 e-145.6t .\nA plot of this time function and the two constituent modes is shown in\nFigure 1.40.\nNote that pressure P (t) varies rapidly from an initial value of P (0) =\n-3 × 105 [Pa] to exponentially approach a final value of P (inf) = 0. Since\nwe have defined P (t) = Pc(t) - Ps, this means that the pressure at the\nvalve varies rapidly from an initial value of Pc(0) = 0 to a final value of\nPc(inf) = Ps = 3 × 105 Pa. This sudden variation in pressure exerts a near\nstep in force on the end of the pipe of F = Pc A, where A is the pipe\narea. If the pipe inner diameter is 2 × 10-2 m then\n·\nA = πD2 = 3 × 10-4 m,\n4 ∼\nand thus F = 3 × 105 3 × 10-4 = 90 N. This significant force is applied to\n·\nthe valve body which is supported by the wall framing members. The step\nload on the wall results in the characteristic banging sound. (Similar forces\nalso occur where the pipe makes turns in its path through the walls, and\nthus you hear banging throughout the plumbing system when you suddenly\nshut off the shower.) Be kind to your plumbing and turn the valve off a bit\nslowly!\n1.3\nHigher-order systems\nFor higher-order linear time invariant systems, the response to initial condi\ntions will be of the form x(t) = c1es1t +c2es2t +\n+cnesnt if the system poles\n· · ·\nare distinct. The case of coincident poles is discussed in the next section.\nThe system order n is equal to the number of state variables required to\nrepresent the system, or alternatively the order of the system characteristic\nequation. The (possibly complex) values s1,\n, sn are referred to as the\n· · ·\ncharacteristic frequencies, or eigenvalues, or equivalently as the poles of the\nsystem, and the (possibly complex) values c1,\n, cn are determined by the\n· · ·\nsystem initial conditions. The poles of a system are often plotted in the s-\nplane where the horizontal axis is the real part of the pole, and the vertical\naxis is the imaginary part of the pole. The advantage of this plot is that the\nsystem time response characteristics can be deduced from a single graphical\nrepresentation.\n1.3.1\nCoincident roots\nWhen the number of distinct solutions of the characteristic equation is less\nthan the system order n, some of the poles will be coincident.

NATURAL RESPONSE\nare coincident poles, the number of poles at a given location is referred to as\nthe multiplicity of the pole. A pole si of multiplicity 1 has associated with it\na solution esit . Poles of multiplicity 2 have associated with them solutions\nesit and tesit. Poles of multiplicity 3 have associated with them solutions esit ,\ntesit and t2esit . In the general case, poles of multiplicity m have associated\nsolutions esit , tesit , . . . , tm-1esit. This result holds for complex poles as well\nas real-axis poles. In satisfying initial conditions, each associated term is\nmultiplied by a (possibly complex) weighting coefficient.\n1.3.2\nLinearity\nThe differential equations we've been studying in this chapter are linear.\nThis is so because they have terms which are weighted sums of time deriva\ntives of the signal of interest. The operation of arbitrary order differentiation\nfollowed by multiplication by a constant is linear. By linear we mean that\nif operating on signal u1 produces output signal y1, and operating on input\nsignal u2 produces output signal y2, then the weighted combination of input\nsignals αu1 + βu2 produces the output signal which is the weighted combi\nnation αy1 + βy2 of the individual responses, for all signals and weighting\ncoefficients. Said another way, superposition applies; the summation of input\nsignals does not produce new sorts of output responses.\nIn the context of homogeneous or natural responses, this means that if\nwe have calculated the response of a system to two sets of initial condi\ntions, then the response to a weighted sum of these initial conditions is the\nweighted sum of the individual responses. That is, suppose we have one set\nof initial conditions C1 which produces a homogeneous response signal x1(t),\nand another set of initial conditions C2 which produces a homogeneous re\nponse signal x2(t). Then if and only if the system is linear the response\nto initial conditions αC1 + βC2 is αx1 + βx2. This property holds for the\nlinear constant coefficient differential equations we have been studying in\nthis chapter.\nAs a counterexample, suppose one of the differential equations contains\na term x2. Linearity does not hold here, since (x1 +x2)2 =\nx2\n1 +x2\n2. Squaring\nis a nonlinear operation. We will discuss some aspects of nonlinear systems\nin subsequent chapters. However, it is not possible to provide broadly ap\nplicable exact analytical solutions for nonlinear systems. The tremendous\npower of linear system theory comes in large part from the generality of the\nresults.\n\nChapter 2\nDriven Response\n2.1\nFirst-order mechanical system step response\nSuppose we now drive the first-order mechanical system of Figure 1.6 with\na force F , as shown in Figure 2.1. Now let the force take the form of a step\nfunction F (t) = F0us(t). If the initial value for x is assumed equal to zero,\nthen the system position response is given by\nx(t) = Fo (1 - e-t/τ )\n(t ≥ 0)\n(2.1)\nk\nwhere τ = b/k as before. The response begins at the initial value of zero\nand exponentially approaches the final value with a time constant τ . It is\ninteresting to note that the final value is given by x(inf) = F0/k, that is, the\nsteady-state force F0 divided by the spring constant k. This makes physical\nsense, since the damper force depends upon velocity and it thus supplies no\nforce in steady-state. As before, the response becomes faster as τ decreases,\nas shown in Figure 2.2 where the response is plotted for F0 = k, and with\nfour values τ = 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1.\nTwo more features of the step response bear noting. First, the difference\nbetween the current and final values decreases by a multiplicative factor\nof e-1 ≈ 37% in each interval of one time constant. Second, the slope at\nany point when projected to the final value defines an interval of one time\nconstant. These features are illustrated in Figures 2.3 and 2.4, respectively.\nFor most practical purposes, the step response is considered complete\nin about four or five time constants (i.e., within 1-2% of final value). Note\nhowever, that if very high accuracy is required, a much larger number of\ntime constants are needed in order to consider the response to be settled\n\nCHAPTER 2.

The\n·\nsettling behavior over six time constants (τ = 0.5) is shown in Figure 2.5.\n2.2\nFirst-order thermal system driven response\nThe temperature of the envelope of an incandescent light bulb can be rea\nsonably well modeled as a first-order lumped thermal system. To investigate\nthis, I measured the temperature of the bulb in a desk lamp, as shown in\nFigure 2.6.\nThe temperature of the bulb is sensed with a thermocouple which mea\nsures temperature by means of the variation of voltage generated across a\njunction between two dissimilar metals. The thermocouple used in this ex\nperiment is shown in Figure 2.7. The thermocouple junction is attached to\nthe light bulb with tape under an insulating patch. The insulating patch\nis used so that the thermocouple temperature is equal to the bulb envelope\ntemperature.\nWith the bulb equilibrated to room temperature, I turned on the lamp,\nwaited about 10 minutes for the bulb to reach nearly steady state tempera\n\nCHAPTER 2. DRIVEN RESPONSE\nFigure 2.6: Instrumentation for measuring temperature of the incandescent\nbulb in a desk lamp.

I recorded the bulb temperature every\nfive seconds over the course of the experiment as the bulb heated and cooled.\nThis data is shown in Figure 2.8. To graphical accuracy, the data looks very\nclose to first-order. The small glitch in the data at about 1130 sec is due\nto bumping the test lead, which resulted in movement of the thermocou\nple, and thus a transient in temperature. Experimental data commonly has\nsuch extra effects included, and we need to exercise judgement as to what\naspects of the data to attempt to include in our models. It is also important\nto properly report the sources of known anomalies in your own work.\nIn order to fit the data to an exponential response from a first-order\nmodel, I wrote a Matlab script to plot the data and a model response. The\nfitted response appears as shown in Figure 2.9. The temperature data is in\nterms of rise above ambient; on the day this data was taken, the ambient\ntemperature was 29 *C. The model fit is reasonably good with the functions\nshown. Thus we could use a first-order model to make predictions of the\nbulb temperature as a function of other driving functions than the long\non/off cycle shown.\n2.3\nStep response of second-order mechanical sys\ntem\nConsider again the second-order mechanical system shown in Figure 1.19.\nWe modify this system to include a driving force F acting in the x-direction\nas shown in Figure 2.10. A free-body diagram for the system is given in\nFigure 2.11. The differential equation for this system is\nd 2x\ndx\nm\n+ b\n+ kx = F.\n(2.2)\ndt2\ndt\nWe now let the input force take the form of a step F (t) = F0us(t) with\namplitude F0, and further assume the system has zero initial conditions. The\nhomogeneous part of the solution will take the forms that we have discussed\npreviously, depending upon the damping ratio. The underdamped case is of\ninterest here, so we will further assume 0 < ζ < 1.\nWith the step input, we can calculate the response by thinking in terms\nof a particular solution plus homogeneous solution. In steady-state, the\ninput force has the constant value F0. This force is balanced in steady-state\nby the deflection of the spring such that the net force on the mass is zero.\nThat is, we postulate the particular solution xp(t) = F0/k. As this solution\nhas zero velocity and acceleration, the damper and mass do not contribute\n\nCHAPTER 2.

STEP RESPONSE OF SECOND-ORDER MECHANICAL SYSTEM77\nany term. To satisfy the condition of zero initial velocity and position, a\nsuitable homogeneous response xh must be added to the particular response\nfound above.\nThe homogeneous response must be such as to satisfy initial conditions\nwhen it is added to the particular solution. The homogeneous response will\ntake the form developed in the previous chapter. Since xp(0) = F0/k, and\nwe assume zero initial conditions, then we must have from the homogeneous\nresponse that xh(0) = -F0/k, and xh(0) = 0.\nFor the underdamped case considered here, the homogeneous solution\nwill thus take either the rectangular form (1.57) or the polar form (1.66).\nApplying the intial condition relations from that section yields the homoge\nneous solution as\nxh(t) = -(F0/k)e-σt(cos ωdt + σ\nωd\nsin ωdt)\n(2.3)\n= -(F0/k)ωn\nωd\ne-σt sin(ωdt + φ)\n(2.4)\nHere two equivalent forms of the solution are given, where we define φ =\narctan(\n#\n1 - ζ2/ζ) and recall the definitions σ = ζωn and ωd = ωn\n#\n1 - ζ2.\nThe complete solution is\nx(t) = xp(t) + xh(t)\n=\n(F0/k)(1 - e-σt(cos ωdt + σ sin ωdt)) (2.5)\nωd\n=\n(F0/k)(1 - ωn e-σt sin(ωdt + φ))\n(2.6)\nωd\nSince the system is linear, the character of the response does not de\npend upon the driving amplitude, and we thus can normalize the problem\nby choosing F0 = k (or alternately plot all response magnitudes in units\nof F0/k). With this choice, the normalized response is\nxn(t)\n=\n1 - e-σt(cos ωdt + σ sin ωdt)\n(2.7)\nωd\n=\n1 - ω\nω\nn\nd\ne-σt sin(ωdt + φ)\n(2.8)\nA plot of this solution is shown in Figure 2.12 for various values of ζ.\nIn this plot, we have normalized the amplitude as discussed above, and also\nnormalized time to t′ = ωnt. Note that in this plot, ζ affects both the\novershoot (with a maximum of 100% overshoot for the case ζ = 0) and the\nduration of the ringing in the response.\nSecond-order systems occur frequently in practice, and so standard pa\nrameters of this response have been defined. These include the maximum\n\nCHAPTER 2.

These pa\nrameters are defined with respect to a standard second-order response as\nshown in Figure 2.13.\n2.3.1\nOvershoot\nLet's start with a discussion of the overshoot.

That is, the peak value is xpeak = 1 + Mp. At the\nvalue of time tp for the peak, we can calculate the magnitude of the response\nas\nx(tp)\n=\n1 - e-σπ/ωd (cos π + σ sin π)\n(2.12)\nωd\n= 1 + e-σπ/ωd .\n(2.13)\nWith the definition of the peak value given above, we thus have\nMp = e-σπ/ωd\n(2.14)\n= e-πζ/√\n1-ζ2 ; 0 ≤ ζ < 1.\n(2.15)\nRecall that this formula only applies in the underdamped case, as indicated\nexplicitly above.\nWhile the result above is exact, it is a bit cumbersome to remember and\nto manipulate for design calculations. Thus, we introduce the approximation\nζ\nMp ≈ 1 - 0.6.\n(2.16)\nThis linear approximation is easier to compute with and for many design\nproblems is sufficiently accurate.\n\nCHAPTER 2. DRIVEN RESPONSE\n2.3.2\nRise time\nWe define the rise time tr as indicated in Figure 2.13 as the time required for\nthe response to transit between 10% and 90% of the final value.1 Inspection\nof Figure 2.12 shows that the rise time is not strongly dependent upon ζ,\nwhereas it scales linearly with ωn. For intermediate values of ζ, the rise time\nis approximately given by\n1.8\ntr ≈ ωn\n.\n(2.17)\nThis approximation is very useful for determining the approximate natural\nfrequency based upon step response measurements, or in sketching the step\nresponse of a known system.\n2.3.3\nSettling time\nFinally, we define the settling time. As shown in Figure 2.13, the settling\ntime is the time required for the response to stay within a defined error\nband ±∆ of the final normalized value of unity. The exact criterion is\ndifficult to express in analytic form, and so we use the conservative approxi\nmation of calculating the time at which the envelope of the response reaches\nvalues within the error band. This approximation is conservative, since the\nresponse itself never lies outside the envelope. Since the envelope decays\nto the final value of unity with an error magnitude of e-σt, it reaches the\ntolerance band for\ne-σts = ∆,\n(2.18)\nand thus we have -σts = ln ∆, or\nts = -σ ln ∆.\n(2.19)\nIn order to calculate the settling time to a given value, it helps to re\nmember that e2.3 ≈ 10, and thus, for example ln 0.01 ≈-4.6. With this\ninsight, the 1% settling time is given by\n4.6\nts ≈ ζωn\n; (1% settling).\n(2.20)\n1Some texts define rise time as the time required to transit between 0% and 100%, since\nthis is easier to calculate explicitly. However, in engineering practice, such a measure is\ndifficult to implement, and the dependence on ζ is much stronger. Thus, in engineering\npractice we use the 10-90% rise time. Where these need to be distinguished, we can insert\nthe subscript 10-90 or 0-100 to be clear which is being discussed.\n\n2.3. STEP RESPONSE OF SECOND-ORDER MECHANICAL SYSTEM81\nThere is, of course, nothing special about settling to 1%. For example, if\na large machine tool takes a move of 1 m, and if it can be modelled as a\nsecond order system, and if we require it to settle to 1 μm, then the settling\ntime will be much longer. This specification requires settling to one part in\n∆ = 106 of the move, and thus for this specification we will require a time\nof about 6 ∗ 2.3/ζωn to settle within tolerance.\n2.3.4\nSummary\nThe results developed above are summarized as:\n1.8\ntr ≃\nωn\n(medium values of ζ)\nMp = e-πζ/√\n1-ζ2\n≃\n1 - ζ\n0.6\nπ\ntp = ωd\nts ≃\n4.6\nζωn\n(± 1% error tolerance)\n2.3.5\nApplication to design\nFor the purposes of design, we can use the results derived above to place\nconstraints on the location of the poles of a second order system. For exam\nple, if the rise time must be below a given required value trr, then we must\nhave\n1.8\nωn >\n.\n(2.21)\ntrr\nFurther, if we require that the overshoot be less than some required\nvalue Mpr, then we must have approximately\nζ > 0.6(1 - Mpr).\n(2.22)\nFinally, if we require that the settling time be less than some required\nvalue tsr, then we must have\n4.6\nζωn >\n.\n(2.23)\ntsr\nRecall that ζωn = σ is the real part of the system poles.\nThese constraints can be expressed graphically by requiring that the\nsystem poles lie to the left of the shaded regions in the s-plane shown in\nFigure 2.14.\n\nCHAPTER 2.

You are encouraged to work at the computer as you read the Primer and\nfreely experiment with examples.\nYou should liberally use the on-line help facility for more detailed information. After\nentering MATLAB as described in section 1, the command help will display a list of\nfunctions for which on-line help is available; the command help functionname will give\ninformation about a specific function. The command help eig, for example, will give\ninformation about the eigenvalue function eig. You can preview some of the features of\nMATLAB by entering the command demo.\nThe scope and power of MATLAB go far beyond these notes. Eventually you will\nwant to consult the MATLAB User's Guide and Reference Guide. The documentation\nwhich accompanies the Student Edition of MATLAB is an excellent source. Copies of\nthe complete User's Guide are often available for review at locations such as consulting\ndesks, terminal rooms, computing labs, and the reserve desk of the library. Consult your\ninstructor or your local computing center to learn where the User's Guides are located at\nyour institution.\nMATLAB is available for a number of environments: Sun/Apollo/VAXstation/HP\nworkstations, VAX, MicroVAX, Gould, PC and AT compatibles, 80386 and 80486 com\nputers, Apple Macintosh, and several parallel machines. There is a relatively inexpensive\nStudent Edition available from Prentice Hall publishers. The information in these notes\napplies generally to all of these environments.\nWhile the second edition of the Primer is based on version 3.5 of MATLAB, it is\ncompatible with version 4.0 with the fundamental differences noted. An edition of the\nPrimer based on version 4.0 is under development.\nThe plain TEX source (and a PostScript file primer35.ps) of this second edition\nof the MATLAB Primer is available via anonymous ftp from math.ufl.edu as the file\nprimer35.tex in the directory pub/matlab. If ftp is unavailable to you, it can be obtained\nvia listserv by sending an email message to listserv@math.ufl.edu which contains the\nsingle line send matlab/primer35.tex. It can also be obtained by sending a request to\nthe author at sigmon@math.ufl.edu. The latest edition of the Primer will always be\navailable as indicated above as the file primer.tex. A Spanish version is also available\nthere.\nMATLAB is licensed by The MathWorks, Inc., Cochituate Place, 24 Prime Park Way,\nNatick, MA 01760, (508)653-1415, Fax: (508)653-2997, Email: info@mathworks.com.\nc\n(6-93)\nCopyright 1989, 1992 by Kermit Sigmon\nii\n\nContents\nPage\n1.

Accessing MATLAB.\nOn most systems, after logging in one can enter MATLAB with the system command\nmatlab and exit MATLAB with the command exit or quit. On a PC, for example, if\nproperly installed, one may enter MATLAB with the command:\nC> matlab\nand exit it with the command:\n>> quit\nOn systems permitting multiple processes, such as a Unix system, you will find it\nconvenient, for reasons discussed in section 14, to keep both MATLAB and your local editor\nactive. If you are working on a workstation which runs processes in multiple windows, you\nwill want to keep MATLAB active in one window and your local editor active in another.\nYou should consult your instructor or your local computer center for details of the local\ninstallation.\n2. Entering matrices.\nMATLAB works with essentially only one kind of object--a rectangular numerical\nmatrix with possibly complex entries; all variables represent matrices. In some situations,\n1-by-1 matrices are interpreted as scalars and matrices with only one row or one column\nare interpreted as vectors.\nMatrices can be introduced into MATLAB in several different ways:\n- Entered by an explicit list of elements,\n- Generated by built-in statements and functions,\n- Created in M-files (see sections 12 and 14 below),\n- Loaded from external data files (see User's Guide).\nFor example, either of the statements\nA = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]\nand\nA = [\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9 ]\ncreates the obvious 3-by-3 matrix and assigns it to a variable A. Try it. The elements\nwithin a row of a matrix may be separated by commas as well as a blank.\nWhen listing a number in exponential form (e.g. 2.34e-9), blank spaces must be\navoided. Listing entries of a large matrix is best done in an M-file, where errors can\nbe easily edited away (see sections 12 and 14).\nThe built-in functions rand, magic, and hilb, for example, provide an easy way to\ncreate matrices with which to experiment. The command rand(n) will create an n × n\nmatrix with randomly generated entries distributed uniformly between 0 and 1, while\n\nrand(m,n) will create an m × n one. magic(n) will create an integral n × n matrix which\nis a magic square (rows and columns have common sum); hilb(n) will create the n × n\nHilbert matrix, the king of ill-conditioned matrices (m and n denote, of course, positive\nintegers). Matrices can also be generated with a for-loop (see section 6 below).\nIndividual matrix and vector entries can be referenced with indices inside parentheses\nin the usual manner. For example, A(2, 3) denotes the entry in the second row, third\ncolumn of matrix A and x(3) denotes the third coordinate of vector x. Try it. A matrix\nor a vector will only accept positive integers as indices.\n3. Matrix operations, array operations.\nThe following matrix operations are available in MATLAB:\n+\naddition\n-\nsubtraction\n\nmultiplication\nb\npower\ntranspose\n\\\nleft division\n/\nright division\nThese matrix operations apply, of course, to scalars (1-by-1 matrices) as well. If the sizes\nof the matrices are incompatible for the matrix operation, an error message will result,\nexcept in the case of scalar-matrix operations (for addition, subtraction, and division as\nwell as for multiplication) in which case each entry of the matrix is operated on by the\nscalar.\nThe \"matrix division\" operations deserve special comment. If A is an invertible square\nmatrix and b is a compatible column, resp. row, vector, then\nx = A\\b is the solution of A x = b and, resp.,\nx = b/A is the solution of x A = b.\nIn left division, if A is square, then it is factored using Gaussian elimination and these\nfactors are used to solve A x = b. If A is not square, it is factored using Householder\northogonalization with column pivoting and the factors are used to solve the under- or\nover- determined system in the least squares sense. Right division is defined in terms of\nleft division by b/A = (A0\\b0)0 .\nArray operations. The matrix operations of addition and subtraction already op\nerate entry-wise but the other matrix operations given above do not--they are matrix\noperations. It is important to observe that these other operations, , b , \\, and /, can\nbe made to operate entry-wise by preceding them by a period. For example, either\n[1,2,3,4].*[1,2,3,4] or [1,2,3,4].b 2 will yield [1,4,9,16]. Try it. This is par\nticularly useful when using Matlab graphics.\n\n4. Statements, expressions, and variables; saving a session.\nMATLAB is an expression language; the expressions you type are interpreted and\nevaluated. MATLAB statements are usually of the form\nvariable = expression, or simply\nexpression\nExpressions are usually composed from operators, functions, and variable names. Eval\nuation of the expression produces a matrix, which is then displayed on the screen and\nassigned to the variable for future use. If the variable name and = sign are omitted, a\nvariable ans (for answer) is automatically created to which the result is assigned.\nA statement is normally terminated with the carriage return. However, a statement can\nbe continued to the next line with three or more periods followed by a carriage return. On\nthe other hand, several statements can be placed on a single line if separated by commas\nor semicolons.\nIf the last character of a statement is a semicolon, the printing is suppressed, but the\nassignment is carried out. This is essential in suppressing unwanted printing of intermediate\nresults.\nMATLAB is case-sensitive in the names of commands, functions, and variables. For\nexample, solveUT is not the same as solveut.\nThe command who will list the variables currently in the workspace. A variable can be\ncleared from the workspace with the command clear variablename. The command clear\nalone will clear all nonpermanent variables.\nThe permanent variable eps (epsilon) gives the machine precision--about 10-16 on\nmost machines. It is useful in determining tolerences for convergence of iterative processes.\nA runaway display or computation can be stopped on most machines without leaving\nMATLAB with CTRL-C (CTRL-BREAK on a PC).\nSaving a session. When one logs out or exits MATLAB all variables are lost. How\never, invoking the command save before exiting causes all variables to be written to a\nnon-human-readable diskfile named matlab.mat. When one later reenters MATLAB, the\ncommand load will restore the workspace to its former state.\n5. Matrix building functions.\nConvenient matrix building functions are\neye\nidentity matrix\nzeros\nmatrix of zeros\nones\nmatrix of ones\ndiag\nsee below\ntriu\nupper triangular part of a matrix\ntril\nlower triangular part of a matrix\nrand\nrandomly generated matrix\nhilb\nHilbert matrix\nmagic\nmagic square\ntoeplitz\nsee help toeplitz\n\nFor example, zeros(m,n) produces an m-by-n matrix of zeros and zeros(n) produces an\nn-by-n one; if A is a matrix, then zeros(A) produces a matrix of zeros of the same size\nas A.\nIf x is a vector, diag(x) is the diagonal matrix with x down the diagonal; if A is a square\nmatrix, then diag(A) is a vector consisting of the diagonal of A. What is diag(diag(A))?\nTry it.\nMatrices can be built from blocks. For example, if A is a 3-by-3 matrix, then\nB = [A, zeros(3,2); zeros(2,3), eye(2)]\nwill build a certain 5-by-5 matrix. Try it.\n6. For, while, if -- and relations.\nIn their basic forms, these MATLAB flow control statements operate like those in most\ncomputer languages.\nFor. For example, for a given n, the statement\nx = []; for i = 1:n, x=[x,ib 2], end\nor\nx = [];\nfor i = 1:n\nx = [x,ib 2]\nend\nwill produce a certain n-vector and the statement\nx = []; for i = n:-1:1, x=[x,ib 2], end\nwill produce the same vector in reverse order. Try them. Note that a matrix may be\nempty (such as x = []). The statements\nfor i = 1:m\nfor j = 1:n\nH(i, j) = 1/(i+j-1);\nend\nend\nH\nwill produce and print to the screen the m-by-n hilbert matrix. The semicolon on the inner\nstatement suppresses printing of unwanted intermediate results while the last H displays\nthe final result.\nWhile. The general form of a while loop is\nwhile relation\nstatements\nend\nThe statements will be repeatedly executed as long as the relation remains true. For exam\nple, for a given number a, the following will compute and display the smallest nonnegative\ninteger n such that 2n a:\n\nn = 0;\nwhile 2b n < a\nn = n + 1;\nend\nn\nIf. The general form of a simple if statement is\nif relation\nstatements\nend\nThe statements will be executed only if the relation is true. Multiple branching is also\npossible, as is illustrated by\nif n < 0\nparity = 0;\nelseif rem(n,2) == 0\nparity = 2;\nelse\nparity = 1;\nend\nIn two-way branching the elseif portion would, of course, be omitted.\nRelations. The relational operators in MATLAB are\n<\nless than\n>\ngreater than\n<=\nless than or equal\n>=\ngreater than or equal\n==\nequal\n≥=\nnot\n\nequal.\n\nNote that \"=\" is used in an assignment statement while \"==\" is used in a relation.\nRelations may be connected or quantified by the logical operators\n&\nand\n\n|\nor\n≥\nnot.\nWhen applied to scalars, a relation is actually the scalar 1 or 0 depending on whether\nthe relation is true or false. Try 3 < 5, 3 > 5, 3 == 5, and 3 == 3. When applied\nto matrices of the same size, a relation is a matrix of 0's and 1's giving the value of the\nrelation between corresponding entries. Try a = rand(5), b = triu(a), a == b.\nA relation between matrices is interpreted by while and if to be true if each entry of\nthe relation matrix is nonzero. Hence, if you wish to execute statement when matrices A\nand B are equal you could type\n\nif A == B\nstatement\nend\nbut if you wish to execute statement when A and B are not equal, you would type\nif any(any(A ≥= B))\nstatement\nend\nor, more simply,\nif A == B else\nstatement\nend\nNote that the seemingly obvious\nif A ≥= B, statement, end\nwill not give what is intended since statement would execute only if each of the correspond\ning entries of A and B differ. The functions any and all can be creatively used to reduce\nmatrix relations to vectors or scalars. Two any's are required above since any is a vector\noperator (see section 8).\nThe for statement permits any matrix to be used instead of 1:n. See the User's Guide\nfor details of how this feature expands the power of the for statement.\n7. Scalar functions.\nCertain MATLAB functions operate essentially on scalars, but operate element-wise\nwhen applied to a matrix. The most common such functions are\nsin\nasin\nexp\nabs\nround\ncos\nacos\nlog (natural log) sqrt\nfloor\ntan\natan\nrem (remainder) sign\nceil\n8. Vector functions.\nOther MATLAB functions operate essentially on a vector (row or column), but act\non an m-by-n matrix (m 2) in a column-by-column fashion to produce a row vector\ncontaining the results of their application to each column. Row-by-row action can be\nobtained by using the transpose; for example, mean(A')'. A few of these functions are\nmax\nsum\nmin\nprod\nsort\nmedian\nany\nmean\nall\nstd\nFor example, the maximum entry in a matrix A is given by max(max(A)) rather than\nmax(A). Try it.\n\n9. Matrix functions.\nMuch of MATLAB's power comes from its matrix functions. The most useful ones are\neig\neigenvalues and eigenvectors\nchol\ncholesky factorization\nsvd\nsingular value decomposition\ninv\ninverse\nlu\nLU factorization\nqr\nQR factorization\nhess\nhessenberg form\nschur\nschur decomposition\nrref\nreduced row echelon form\nexpm\nmatrix exponential\nsqrtm\nmatrix square root\npoly\ncharacteristic polynomial\ndet\ndeterminant\nsize\nsize\nnorm\n1-norm, 2-norm, F-norm, 1-norm\ncond\ncondition number in the 2-norm\nrank\nrank\nMATLAB functions may have single or multiple output arguments. For example,\ny = eig(A), or simply eig(A)\nproduces a column vector containing the eigenvalues of A while\n[U,D] = eig(A)\nproduces a matrix U whose columns are the eigenvectors of A and a diagonal matrix D\nwith the eigenvalues of A on its diagonal. Try it.\n10. Command line editing and recall.\nThe command line in MATLAB can be easily edited. The cursor can be positioned\nwith the left/right arrows and the Backspace (or Delete) key used to delete the character\nto the left of the cursor. Other editing features are also available. On a PC try the Home,\nEnd, and Delete keys; on other systems see help cedit or type cedit.\nA convenient feature is use of the up/down arrows to scroll through the stack of previous\ncommands. One can, therefore, recall a previous command line, edit it, and execute the\nrevised command line. For small routines, this is much more convenient that using an\nM-file which requires moving between MATLAB and the editor (see sections 12 and 14).\nFor example, flopcounts (see section 15) for computing the inverse of matrices of various\nsizes could be compared by repeatedly recalling, editing, and executing\na = rand(8); flops(0), inv(a); flops\nIf one wanted to compare plots of the functions y = sin mx and y = sin nx on the interval\n[0, 2] for various m and n, one might do the same for the command line:\nm=2; n=3; x=0:.01:2*pi; y=sin(m*x); z=cos(n*x); plot(x,y,x,z)\n\n11. Submatrices and colon notation.\nVectors and submatrices are often used in MATLAB to achieve fairly complex data\nmanipulation effects. \"Colon notation\" (which is used both to generate vectors and refer\nence submatrices) and subscripting by vectors are keys to efficient manipulation of these\nobjects. Creative use of these features permits one to minimize the use of loops (which\nslows MATLAB) and to make code simple and readable. Special effort should be made to\nbecome familiar with them.\nThe expression 1:5 (met earlier in for statements) is actually the row vector [1 2 3\n4 5]. The numbers need not be integers nor the increment one. For example,\n0.2:0.2:1.2\ngives [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2], and\n5:-1:1 gives [5 4 3 2 1].\nThe following statements will, for example, generate a table of sines. Try it.\nx = [0.0:0.1:2.0]0 ;\ny = sin(x);\n[x y]\nNote that since sin operates entry-wise, it produces a vector y from the vector x.\nThe colon notation can be used to access submatrices of a matrix. For example,\nA(1:4,3) is the column vector consisting of the first four entries of the third column\nof A.\nA colon by itself denotes an entire row or column:\nA(:,3) is the third column of A, and A(1:4,:) is the first four rows.\nArbitrary integral vectors can be used as subscripts:\nA(:,[2 4]) contains as columns, columns 2 and 4 of A.\nSuch subscripting can be used on both sides of an assignment statement:\nA(:,[2 4 5]) = B(:,1:3) replaces columns 2,4,5 of A with the first three columns\nof B. Note that the entire altered matrix A is printed and assigned. Try it.\nColumns 2 and 4 of A can be multiplied on the right by the 2-by-2 matrix [1 2;3 4]:\nA(:,[2,4]) = A(:,[2,4])*[1 2;3 4]\nOnce again, the entire altered matrix is printed and assigned.\nIf x is an n-vector, what is the effect of the statement x = x(n:-1:1)? Try it.\nTo appreciate the usefulness of these features, compare these MATLAB statements\nwith a Pascal, FORTRAN, or C routine to effect the same.\n12. M-files.\nMATLAB can execute a sequence of statements stored on diskfiles. Such files are called\n\"M-files\" because they must have the file type of \".m\" as the last part of their filename.\nMuch of your work with MATLAB will be in creating and refining M-files.\nThere are two types of M-files: script files and function files.\n\nScript files. A script file consists of a sequence of normal MATLAB statements. If the\nfile has the filename, say, rotate.m, then the MATLAB command rotate will cause the\nstatements in the file to be executed. Variables in a script file are global and will change the\nvalue of variables of the same name in the environment of the current MATLAB session.\nScript files are often used to enter data into a large matrix; in such a file, entry errors\ncan be easily edited out. If, for example, one enters in a diskfile data.m\nA = [\n1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8\n];\nthen the MATLAB statement data will cause the assignment given in data.m to be carried\nout.\nAn M-file can reference other M-files, including referencing itself recursively.\nFunction files. Function files provide extensibility to MATLAB. You can create new\nfunctions specific to your problem which will then have the same status as other MATLAB\nfunctions. Variables in a function file are by default local. However, version 4.0 permits a\nvariable to be declared global.\nWe first illustrate with a simple example of a function file.\nfunction a = randint(m,n)\n%RANDINT Randomly generated integral matrix.\n%\nrandint(m,n) returns an m-by-n such matrix with entries\n%\nbetween 0 and 9.\na = floor(10*rand(m,n));\nA more general version of this function is the following:\nfunction a = randint(m,n,a,b)\n%RANDINT Randomly generated integral matrix.\n%\nrandint(m,n) returns an m-by-n such matrix with entries\n%\nbetween 0 and 9.\n%\nrand(m,n,a,b) return entries between integers a and b.\nif nargin < 3, a = 0; b = 9; end\na = floor((b-a+1)*rand(m,n)) + a;\nThis should be placed in a diskfile with filename randint.m (corresponding to the function\nname). The first line declares the function name, input arguments, and output arguments;\nwithout this line the file would be a script file. Then a MATLAB statement\nz = randint(4,5), for example, will cause the numbers 4 and 5 to be passed to the\nvariables m and m in the function file with the output result being passed out to the\nvariable z. Since variables in a function file are local, their names are independent of those\nin the current MATLAB environment.\nNote that use of nargin (\"number of input arguments\") permits one to set a default\nvalue of an omitted input variable--such as a and b in the example.\n\nA function may also have multiple output arguments. For example:\nfunction [mean, stdev] = stat(x)\n% STAT Mean and standard deviation\n%\nFor a vector x, stat(x) returns the\n%\nmean and standard deviation of x.\n%\nFor a matrix x, stat(x) returns two row vectors containing,\n%\nrespectively, the mean and standard deviation of each column.\n[m n] = size(x);\nif m == 1\nm = n; % handle case of a row vector\nend\nmean = sum(x)/m;\nstdev = sqrt(sum(x.b 2)/m - mean.b 2);\nOnce this is placed in a diskfile stat.m, a MATLAB command [xm, xd] = stat(x), for\nexample, will assign the mean and standard deviation of the entries in the vector x to\nxm and xd, respectively. Single assignments can also be made with a function having\nmultiple output arguments. For example, xm = stat(x) (no brackets needed around xm)\nwill assign the mean of x to xm.\nThe % symbol indicates that the rest of the line is a comment; MATLAB will ignore\nthe rest of the line. However, the first few comment lines, which document the M-file, are\navailable to the on-line help facility and will be displayed if, for example, help stat is\nentered. Such documentation should always be included in a function file.\nThis function illustrates some of the MATLAB features that can be used to produce\nefficient code. Note, for example, that x.b 2 is the matrix of squares of the entries of x,\nthat sum is a vector function (section 8), that sqrt is a scalar function (section 7), and\nthat the division in sum(x)/m is a matrix-scalar operation.\nThe following function, which gives the greatest common divisor of two integers via\nthe Euclidean algorithm, illustrates the use of an error message (see the next section).\nfunction a = gcd(a,b)\n% GCD Greatest common divisor\n%\ngcd(a,b) is the greatest common divisor of\n%\nthe integers a and b, not both zero.\na = round(abs(a)); b = round(abs(b));\nif a == 0 & b == 0\nerror('The gcd is not defined when both numbers are zero')\nelse\nwhile b ≥= 0\nr = rem(a,b);\na = b; b = r;\nend\nend\n\nSome more advanced features are illustrated by the following function. As noted earlier,\nsome of the input arguments of a function--such as tol in the example, may be made\noptional through use of nargin (\"number of input arguments\"). The variable nargout\ncan be similarly used. Note that the fact that a relation is a number (1 when true; 0 when\nfalse) is used and that, when while or if evaluates a relation, \"nonzero\" means \"true\"\nand 0 means \"false\". Finally, the MATLAB function feval permits one to have as an\ninput variable a string naming another function.\nfunction [b, steps] = bisect(fun, x, tol)\n%BISECT Zero of a function of one variable via the bisection method.\n%\nbisect(fun,x) returns a zero of the function. fun is a string\n%\ncontaining the name of a real-valued function of a single\n%\nreal variable; ordinarily functions are defined in M-files.\n%\nx is a starting guess. The value returned is near a point\n%\nwhere fun changes sign. For example,\n%\nbisect('sin',3) is pi. Note the quotes around sin.\n%\n%\nAn optional third input argument sets a tolerence for the\n%\nrelative accuracy of the result. The default is eps.\n%\nAn optional second output argument gives a matrix containing a\n%\ntrace of the steps; the rows are of form [c f(c)].\n% Initialization\nif nargin < 3, tol = eps; end\ntrace = (nargout == 2);\nif x ≥= 0, dx = x/20; else, dx = 1/20; end\na = x - dx; fa = feval(fun,a);\nb = x + dx; fb = feval(fun,b);\n% Find change of sign.\nwhile (fa > 0) == (fb > 0)\ndx = 2.0*dx;\na = x - dx; fa = feval(fun,a);\nif (fa > 0) ≥= (fb > 0), break, end\nb = x + dx; fb = feval(fun,b);\nend\nif trace, steps = [a fa; b fb]; end\n% Main loop\nwhile abs(b - a) > 2.0*tol*max(abs(b),1.0)\nc = a + 0.5*(b - a); fc = feval(fun,c);\nif trace, steps = [steps; [c fc]]; end\nif (fb > 0) == (fc > 0)\nb = c; fb = fc;\nelse\n\na = c; fa = fc;\nend\nend\nSome of MATLAB's functions are built-in while others are distributed as M-files. The\nactual listing of any M-file--MATLAB's or your own--can be viewed with the MATLAB\ncommand type functionname. Try entering type eig, type vander, and type rank.\n13. Text strings, error messages, input.\nText strings are entered into MATLAB surrounded by single quotes. For example,\ns = 'This is a test'\nassigns the given text string to the variable s.\nText strings can be displayed with the function disp. For example:\ndisp('this message is hereby displayed')\nError messages are best displayed with the function error\nerror('Sorry, the matrix must be symmetric')\nsince when placed in an M-File, it causes execution to exit the M-file.\nIn an M-file the user can be prompted to interactively enter input data with the function\ninput. When, for example, the statement\niter = input('Enter the number of iterations: ')\nis encountered, the prompt message is displayed and execution pauses while the user keys\nin the input data. Upon pressing the return key, the data is assigned to the variable iter\nand execution resumes.\n14. Managing M-files.\nWhile using MATLAB one frequently wishes to create or edit an M-file and then return\nto MATLAB. One wishes to keep MATLAB active while editing a file since otherwise all\nvariables would be lost upon exiting.\nThis can be easily done using the !-feature. If, while in MATLAB, you precede it with\nan !, any system command--such as those for editing, printing, or copying a file--can be\nexecuted without exiting MATLAB. If, for example, the system command ed accesses your\neditor, the MATLAB command\n>> !ed rotate.m\nwill let you edit the file named rotate.m using your local editor. Upon leaving the editor,\nyou will be returned to MATLAB just where you left it.\nAs noted in section 1, on systems permitting multiple processes, such as one running\nUnix, it may be preferable to keep both MATLAB and your local editor active, keeping\none process suspended while working in the other. If these processes can be run in multiple\nwindows, as on a workstation, you will want to keep MATLAB active in one window and\nyour editor active in another.\nYou may consult your instructor or your local computing center for details of the local\ninstallation.\n\nVersion 4.0 has many debbugging tools. See help dbtype and references given there.\nWhen in MATLAB, the command dir will list the contents of the current directory\nwhile the command what will list only the M-files in the directory. The MATLAB com\nmands delete and type can be used to delete a diskfile and print a file to the screen,\nrespectively, and chdir can be used to change the working directory. While these com\nmands may duplicate system commands, they avoid the use of an !.\nM-files must be accessible to MATLAB. On most mainframe or workstation network\ninstallations, personal M-files which are stored in a subdirectory of one's home directory\nnamed matlab will be accessible to MATLAB from any directory in which one is working.\nSee the discussion of MATLABPATH in the User's Guide for further information.\n15. Comparing efficiency of algorithms: flops and etime.\nTwo measures of the efficiency of an algorithm are the number of floating point oper\nations (flops) performed and the elapsed time.\nThe MATLAB function flops keeps a running total of the flops performed. The\ncommand flops(0) (not flops = 0!) will reset flops to 0. Hence, entering flops(0)\nimmediately before executing an algorithm and flops immediately after gives the flop\ncount for the algorithm.\nThe MATLAB function clock gives the current time accurate to a hundreth of a second\n(see help clock). Given two such times t1 and t2, etime(t2,t1) gives the elapsed time\nfrom t1 to t2. One can, for example, measure the time required to solve a given linear\nsystem Ax = b using Gaussian elimination as follows:\nt = clock; x = A\\b; time = etime(clock,t)\nYou may wish to compare this time--and flop count--with that for solving the system\nusing x = inv(A)*b;. Try it. Version 4.0 has the more convenient tic and toc.\nIt should be noted that, on timesharing machines, etime may not be a reliable measure\nof the efficiency of an algorithm since the rate of execution depends on how busy the\ncomputer is at the time.\n16. Output format.\nWhile all computations in MATLAB are performed in double precision, the format of\nthe displayed output can be controlled by the following commands.\nformat short\nfixed point with 4 decimal places (the default)\nformat long\nfixed point with 14 decimal places\nformat short e\nscientific notation with 4 decimal places\nformat long e\nscientific notation with 15 decimal places\nOnce invoked, the chosen format remains in effect until changed.\nThe command format compact will suppress most blank lines allowing more informa\ntion to be placed on the screen or page. It is independent of the other format commands.\n\n17. Hardcopy.\nHardcopy is most easily obtained with the diary command. The command\ndiary filename\ncauses what appears subsequently on the screen (except graphics) to be written to the\nnamed diskfile (if the filename is omitted it will be written to a default file named diary)\nuntil one gives the command diary off; the command diary on will cause writing to\nthe file to resume, etc. When finished, you can edit the file as desired and print it out on\nthe local system. The !-feature (see section 14) will permit you to edit and print the file\nwithout leaving MATLAB.\n18. Graphics.\nMATLAB can produce both planar plots and 3-D mesh surface plots. To preview some\nof these capabilities in version 3.5, enter the command plotdemo.\nPlanar plots. The plot command creates linear x-y plots; if x and y are vectors of\nthe same length, the command plot(x,y) opens a graphics window and draws an x-y plot\nof the elements of x versus the elements of y. You can, for example, draw the graph of the\nsine function over the interval -4 to 4 with the following commands:\nx = -4:.01:4; y = sin(x); plot(x,y)\nTry it. The vector x is a partition of the domain with meshsize 0.01 while y is a vector\ngiving the values of sine at the nodes of this partition (recall that sin operates entrywise).\nWhen in the graphics screen, pressing any key will return you to the command screen\nwhile the command shg (show graph) will then return you to the current graphics screen.\nIf your machine supports multiple windows with a separate graphics window, you will want\nto keep the graphics window exposed--but moved to the side--and the command window\nactive.\nAs a second example, you can draw the graph of y = e-x 2 over the interval -1.5 to 1.5\nas follows:\nx = -1.5:.01:1.5; y = exp(-x.b 2); plot(x,y)\nNote that one must precede b by a period to ensure that it operates entrywise (see section\n3).\nPlots of parametrically defined curves can also be made. Try, for example,\nt=0:.001:2*pi; x=cos(3*t); y=sin(2*t); plot(x,y)\nThe command grid will place grid lines on the current graph.\nThe graphs can be given titles, axes labeled, and text placed within the graph with\nthe following commands which take a string as an argument.\ntitle\ngraph title\nxlabel\nx-axis label\nylabel\ny-axis label\ngtext\ninteractively-positioned text\ntext\nposition text at specified coordinates\nFor example, the command\n\ntitle('Best Least Squares Fit')\ngives a graph a title. The command gtext('The Spot') allows a mouse or the arrow keys\nto position a crosshair on the graph, at which the text will be placed when any key is\npressed.\nBy default, the axes are auto-scaled. This can be overridden by the command axis. If\nc = [xmin , xmax, ymin, ymax] is a 4-element vector, then axis(c) sets the axis scaling to the\nprecribed limits. By itself, axis freezes the current scaling for subsequent graphs; entering\naxis again returns to auto-scaling. The command axis('square') ensures that the same\nscale is used on both axes. In version 4.0, axis has been significantly changed; see help\naxis.\nTwo ways to make multiple plots on a single graph are illustrated by\nx=0:.01:2*pi;y1=sin(x);y2=sin(2*x);y3=sin(4*x);plot(x,y1,x,y2,x,y3)\nand by forming a matrix Y containing the functional values as columns\nx=0:.01:2*pi; Y=[sin(x)', sin(2*x)', sin(4*x)']; plot(x,Y)\nAnother way is with hold. The command hold freezes the current graphics screen so that\nsubsequent plots are superimposed on it. Entering hold again releases the \"hold.\" The\ncommands hold on and hold off are also available in version 4.0.\nOne can override the default linetypes and pointtypes. For example,\nx=0:.01:2*pi; y1=sin(x); y2=sin(2*x); y3=sin(4*x);\nplot(x,y1,'--',x,y2,':',x,y3,'+')\nrenders a dashed line and dotted line for the first two graphs while for the third the symbol\n+ is placed at each node. The line- and mark-types are\nLinetypes: solid (-), dashed (--). dotted (:), dashdot (-.)\nMarktypes: point (.), plus (+), star (*), circle (o), x-mark (x)\nSee help plot for line and mark colors.\nThe command subplot can be used to partition the screen so that up to four plots can\nbe viewed simultaneously. See help subplot.\nGraphics hardcopy. A hardcopy of the graphics screen can be most easily obtained\nwith the MATLAB command print. It will send a high-resolution copy of the current\ngraphics screen to the printer, placing the graph on the top half of the page.\nIn version 4.0 the meta and gpp commands described below have been absorbed into\nthe print command. See help print.\nProducing unified hard copy of several plots requires more effort. The Matlab command\nmeta filename stores the current graphics screen in a file named filename.met (a \"metafile\")\nin the current directory. Subsequent meta (no filename) commands append a new current\ngraphics screen to the previously named metafile. This metafile--which may now contain\nseveral plots--may be processed later with the graphics post-processor (GPP) program to\nproduce high-resolution hardcopy, two plots per page.\nThe features described in this subsection are not available with the Student Edition of\nMatlab. Graphics hardcopy can be obtained there only with a screen dump: Shift-PrtScr.\n\nThe program GPP (graphics post-processor) is a system command, not a MATLAB\ncommand. However, in practice it is usually involked from within MATLAB using the \"!\"\nfeature (see section 14). It acts on a device-independent metafile to produce an output file\nappropriate for many different hardcopy devices.\nThe selection of the specific hardcopy device is made with the option key \"/d\". For\nexample, the system commands\ngpp filename /dps\ngpp filename /djet\nwill produce files filename.ps and filename.jet suitable for printing on, respectively,\nPostScript and HP LaserJet printers. They can be printed using the usual printing com\nmand for the local system--for example, lpr filename.ps on a Unix system. Entering\nthe system command gpp with no arguments gives a list of all supported hardcopy de\nvices. On a PC, most of this can be automated by appropriately editing the file gpp.bat\ndistributed with MATLAB.\n3-D mesh plots. Three dimensional mesh surface plots are drawn with the function\nmesh. The command mesh(z) creates a three-dimensional perspective plot of the elements\nof the matrix z. The mesh surface is defined by the z-coordinates of points above a\nrectangular grid in the x-y plane. Try mesh(eye(10)).\nTo draw the graph of a function z = f(x, y) over a rectangle, one first defines vectors\nxx and yy which give partitions of the sides of the rectangle. With the function meshdom\n(mesh domain; called meshgrid in version 4.0) one then creates a matrix x, each row of\nwhich equals xx and whose column length is the length of yy, and similarly a matrix y,\neach column of which equals yy, as follows:\n[x,y] = meshdom(xx,yy);\nOne then computes a matrix z, obtained by evaluating f entrywise over the matrices x\nand y, to which mesh can be applied.\nYou can, for example, draw the graph of z = e-x 2 -y over the square [-2, 2] × [-2, 2]\nas follows (try it):\nxx = -2:.1:2;\nyy = xx;\n[x,y] = meshdom(xx,yy);\nz = exp(-x.b 2 - y.b 2);\nmesh(z)\nOne could, of course, replace the first three lines of the preceding with\n[x,y] = meshdom(-2:.1:2, -2:.1:2);\nYou are referred to the User's Guide for further details regarding mesh.\nIn version 4.0, the 3-D graphics capabilities of MATLAB have been considerably ex\npanded. Consult the on-line help for plot3, mesh, and surf.\n\n19. Reference.\nThere are many MATLAB features which cannot be included in these introductory\nnotes.

This document is a brief in\ntroduction to MATLAB that focuses on those features that are of particular importance in\n6.003.1 It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Project Athena, has an Athena account,\nand has little or no experience with MATLAB. Other MATLAB help is available through\nAthena consulting which offers a number of more tutorial handouts and short courses (ext.\n3-4435), on-line consulting (type olc at the Athena prompt), and Athena on-line help (type\nhelp at the Athena prompt). There are a number of books available that describe MAT\nLAB. For example, Engineering Problem Solving with Matlab, by D. M. Etter, published by\nPrentice-Hall (1997) and Mastering MATLAB, by Hanselman and Littlefield, published by\nPrentice-Hall (1996). The paperback MATLAB Primer by K. Sigmon, published by CRC\nPress (1994) is a handy summary of MATLAB instructions. Further information about\nMATLAB can be found at the web page of the vendor (The MathWorks, Inc.) whose URL\nis http://www.mathworks.com. Full documentation can be purchased by contacting The\nMathWorks.\n2 Getting Started\nOn Project Athena, MATLAB can be accessed directly from the Dashboard (menu at the\ntop of the screen after you login to Project Athena) by using the hierarchical menu and\nnavigating as follows:\nNumerical/Math//Analysis and Plotting//MATLAB.\nMATLAB will then open a command window which contains the MATLAB prompt '>>'.\nMATLAB contains a number of useful commands that are similar to UNIX commands,\ne.g., 'ls', 'pwd', and 'cd'. These are handy for listing MATLAB's working directory, checking\nthe path to the working directory, and changing the working directory. MATLAB checks\nfor MATLAB files in certain directories which are controlled by the command 'path'. The\ncommand 'path' lists the directories in MATLAB's search path. A new directory can be\nappended or prepended to MATLAB's search path with the command path(path,p) or\npath(p,path) where p is some new directory, for example, containing functions written by\nthe user.\nThere is specially designed software available which can also be accessed from the Project\nAthena Dashboard by navigating as follows:\nCourseware//Electrical Engineering and Computer Science//\n6.003 Signals and Systems//MATLAB.\nThese commands display a graphical user interface for exploring several important topics in\n6.003. The same software is used in lecture demonstrations.\n1Revisions of this document will be posted on the 6.003 homepage on the web.\n\nGetting Help from Within MATLAB\nIf you know the name of a function which you would like to learn how to use, use the 'help'\ncommand:\n>>\nhelp functionname\nThis command displays a description of the function and generally also includes a list of\nrelated functions. If you cannot remember the name of the function, use the 'lookfor'\ncommand and the name of some keyword associated with the function:\n>>\nlookfor keyword\nThis command will display a list of functions that include the keyword in their descriptions.\nOther help commands that you may find useful are 'info', 'what', and 'which'. Descrip\ntions of these commands can be found by using the help command. MATLAB also contains\na variety of demos that can be with the 'demo' command.\nMATLAB Variables -- Scalars, Vectors, and Matri\nces\nMATLAB stores variables in the form of matrices which are M × N , where M is the number\nof rows and N the number of columns. A 1 × 1 matrix is a scalar; a 1 × N matrix is a row\nvector, and M × 1 matrix is a column vector. All elements of a matrix can be real or complex\nnumbers; √-1 can be written as either 'i' or 'j' provided they are not redefined by the user.\nA matrix is written with a square bracket '[]' with spaces separating adjacent columns and\nsemicolons separating adjacent rows. For example, consider the following assignments of the\nvariable x\nReal scalar\n>> x = 5\nComplex scalar >> x = 5+10j (or >> x = 5+10i)\nRow vector\n>> x = [1 2 3] (or x = [1, 2, 3])\nColumn vector\n>> x = [1; 2; 3]\n3 × 3 matrix\n>> x = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]\nThere are a few notes of caution. Complex elements of a matrix should not be typed with\nspaces, i.e., '-1+2j' is fine as a matrix element, '-1 + 2j' is not. Also, '-1+2j' is interpreted\ncorrectly whereas '-1+j2' is not (MATLAB interprets the 'j2' as the name of a variable.\nYou can always write '-1+j*2'.\n4.1 Complex number operations\nSome of the important operations on complex numbers are illustrated below\n\nComplex scalar\n>> x = 3+4j\nReal part of x\n>> real(x)\n=\n⇒\nImaginary part of x\n>> imag(x)\n=\n⇒\nMagnitude of x\n>> abs(x)\n=\n⇒\nAngle of x\n>> angle(x) =\n0.9273\n⇒\nComplex conjugate of x >> conj(x)\n=\n3 - 4i\n⇒\n4.2 Generating vectors\nVectors can be generated using the ':' command. For example, to generate a vector x that\ntakes on the values 0 to 10 in increments of 0.5, type the following which generates a 1 × 21\nmatrix\n>> x = [0:0.5:10];\nOther ways to generate vectors include the commands: 'linspace' which generates a vector\nby specifying the first and last number and the number of equally spaced entries between\nthe first and last number, and 'logspace' which is the same except that entries are spaced\nlogarithmically between the first and last entry.\n4.3 Accessing vector elements\nElements of a matrix are accessed by specifying the row and column. For example, in the\nmatrix specified by A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9], the element in the first row and third\ncolumn can be accessed by writing\n>> x = A(1,3) which yields 3\nThe entire second row can be accessed with\n>> y = A(2,:) which yields [4 5 6]\nwhere the ':' here means \"take all the entries in the column\". A submatrix of A consisting\nof rows 1 and 2 and all three columns is specified by\n>> z = A(1:2,1:3) which yields [1 2 3; 4 5 6]\n5 Matrix Operations\nMATLAB contains a number of arithmetic, relational, and logical operations on matrices.\n\n5.1 Arithmetic matrix operations\nThe basic arithmetic operations on matrices (and of course scalars which are special cases\nof matrices) are:\n+ addition\n-\nsubtraction\n* multiplication\n/ right division\n\\ left division\n^ exponentiation (power)\n' conjugate transpose\nAn error message occurs if the sizes of matrices are incompatible for the operation. Division\nis defined as follows: The solution to A ∗ x = b is x = A\\b and the solution to x ∗ A = b is\nx = b/A provided A is invertible and all the matrices are compatible.\nAddition and subtraction involve element-by-element arithmetic operations; matrix mul\ntiplication and division do not. However, MATLAB provides for element-by-element opera\ntions as well by prepending a '.' before the operator as follows:\n.* multiplication\n./ right division\n.\\ left division\n.^ exponentiation (power)\n.' transpose (unconjugated)\nThe difference between matrix multiplication and element-by-element multiplication is\nseen in the following example\n>>A = [1 2; 3 4]\nA =\n>>B=A*A\nB =\n\n>>C=A.*A\nC =\n\n5.2 Relational operations\nThe following relational operations are defined:\n\n<\nless than\n<= less than or equal to\n>\ngreater than\n>= greater than or equal to\n== equal to\n~= not equal to\nThese are element-be-element operations which return a matrix of ones (1 = true) and zeros\n(0 = false). Be careful of the distinction between '=' and '=='.\n5.3 Flow control operations\nMATLAB contains the usual set of flow control structures, e.g., for, while, and if, plus\nthe logical operators, e.g., & (and), | (or), and ~ (not).\n5.4 Math functions\nMATLAB comes with a large number of built-in functions that operate on matrices on an\nelement-by element basis. These include:\nsin\nsine\ncos\ncosine\ntan\ntangent\nasin\ninverse sine\nacos\ninverse cosine\natan\ninverse tangent\nexp\nexponential\nlog\nnatural logarithm\nlog10 common logarithm\nsqrt\nsquare root\nabs\nabsolute value\nsign\nsignum\n6 MATLAB Files\nThere are several types of MATLAB files including files that contain scripts of MATLAB\ncommands, files that define user-created MATLAB functions that act just like built-in MAT\nLAB functions, files that include numerical results or plots.\n\n6.1 M-Files\nMATLAB is an interpretive language, i.e., commands typed at the MATLAB prompt are\ninterpreted within the scope of the current MATLAB session. However, it is tedious to type\nin long sequences of commands each time MATLAB is used to perform a task. There are two\nmeans of extending MATLAB's power -- scripts and functions. Both make use of m-files\n(named because they have a .m extension and they are therefore also called dot-m files)\ncreated with a text editor like emacs. The advantage of m-files is that commands are saved\nand can be easily modified without retyping the entire list of commands.\n6.1.1 Scripts\nMATLAB script files are sequences of commands typed with an editor and saved in an m-file.\nTo create an m-file using emacs, you can type from Athena prompt\nathena% emacs filename.m &\nor from within MATLAB\n>> ! emacs filename.m &\nNote that '!' allows execution of UNIX commands directly. In the emacs editor, type\nMATLAB commands in the order of execution. The instructions are executed by typing the\nfile name in the command window at the MATLAB prompt, i.e., the m-file filename.m is\nexecuted by typing\n>> filename\nExecution of the m-file is equivalent to typing the entire list of commands in the command\nwindow at the MATLAB prompt. All the variables used in the m-file are placed in MAT-\nLAB's workspace. The workspace, which is empty when MATLAB is initiated, contains all\nthe variables defined in the MATLAB session.\n6.1.2 Functions\nA second type of m-file is a function file which is generated with an editor exactly as the\nscript file but it has the following general form:\nfunction [output 1, output 2] = functionname(input1, input2)\n%\n%[output 1, output 2] = functionname(input1, input2) Functionname\n%\n% Some comments that explain what the function does go here.\n%\n\nMATLAB command 1;\nMATLAB command 2;\nMATLAB command 3;\nThe name of the m-file for this function is functionname.m and it is called from the MATLAB\ncommand line or from another m-file by the following command\n>> [output1, output2] = functionname(input1, input2)\nNote that any text after the '%' is ignored by MATLAB and can be used for comments.\nOutput typing is suppressed by terminating a line with ';', a line can be extended by typing\n'...' at the end of the line and continuing the instructions to the next line.\n6.2 Mat-Files\nMat-files (named because they have a .mat extension and they are therefore also called dot-\nmat files) are compressed binary files used to store numerical results. These files can be\nused to save results that have been generated by a sequence of MATLAB instructions. For\nexample, to save the values of the two variables, variable1 and variable2 in the file named\nfilename.mat, type\n>> save filename.mat variable1 variable2\nSaving all the current variables in that file is achieved by typing\n>> save filename.mat\nA mat-file can be loaded into MATLAB at some later time by typing\n>> load filename (or load filename.mat)\n6.3 Postscript Files\nPlots generated in MATLAB can be saved to a postscript file so that they can be printed at\na later time (for example, by the standard UNIX 'lpr' command). For example, to save the\ncurrent plot type\n>> print -dps filename.ps\nThe plot can also be printed directly from within MATLAB by typing\n>> print -Pprintername\n\nAmplitude\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\nFigure 1: Example of the plotting of the\nfunction x(t) = te-t cos(2π4t).\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\nTime (s)\nType 'help print' to see additional options.\n6.4 Diary Files\nA written record of a MATLAB session can be kept with the diary command and saved\nin a diary file. To start recording a diary file during a MATLAB session and to save it in\nfilename, type\n>> diary filename\nTo end the recording of information and to close the file type\n>> diary off\n7 Plotting\nMATLAB contains numerous commands for creating two- and three-dimensional plots. The\nmost basic of these commands is 'plot' which can have multiple optional arguments. A\nsimple example of this command is to plot a function of time.\nt = linspace(0, 8, 401);\n%Define a vector of times from ...\n0 to 8 s with 401 points\nx = t.*exp(-t).*cos(2*pi*4*t); %Define a vector of x values\nplot(t,x);\n%Plot x vs t\nxlabel('Time (s)');\n%Label time axis\nylabel('Amplitude');\n%Label amplitude axis\nThis script yields the plot shown in Figure 1.\n\n7.1 Simple plotting commands\nThe simple 2D plotting commands include\nplot\nPlot in linear coordinates as a continuous function\nstem\nPlot in linear coordinates as discrete samples\nloglog\nLogarithmic x and y axes\nsemilogx Linear y and logarithmic x axes\nsemilogy Linear x and logarithmic y axes\nbar\nBar graph\nerrorbar Error bar graph\nhist\nHistogram\npolar\nPolar coordinates\n7.2 Customization of plots\nThere are many commands used to customize plots by annotations, titles, axes labels, etc.\nA few of the most frequently used commands are\nxlabel\nLabels x-axis\nylabel\nLabels y-axis\ntitle\nPuts a title on the plot\ngrid\nAdds a grid to the plot\ngtext\nAllows positioning of text with the mouse\ntext\nAllows placing text at specified coordinates of the plot\naxis\nAllows changing the x and y axes\nfigure\nCreate a figure for plotting\nfigure(n)\nMake figure number n the current figure\nhold on\nAllows multiple plots to be superimposed on the same axes\nhold off\nRelease hold on current plot\nclose(n)\nClose figure number n\nsubplot(a,b,c) Create an a × b matrix of plots with c the current figure\norient\nSpecify orientation of a figure\n8 Signals and Systems Commands\nThe following commands are organized by topics in signals and systems. Each of these\ncommands has a number of options that extend its usefulness.\n8.1 Polynomials\nPolynomials arise frequently in systems theory. MATLAB represents polynomials as row\nvectors of polynomial coefficients. For example, the polynomial s2 + 4s - 5 is represented in\n\nMATLAB by the polynomial >> p = [1 4 -5]. The following is a list of the more impor\ntant commands for manipulating polynomials.\nroots(p)\nExpress the roots of polynomial p as a column vector\npolyval(p,x)\nEvaluate the polynomial p at the values contained in the vector x\nconv(p1,p2)\nComputer the product of the polynomials p1 and p2\ndeconv(p1,p2)\nCompute the quotient of p1 divided by p2\npoly2str(p,'s') Display the polynomial as an equation in s\npoly(r)\nCompute the polynomial given a column vector of roots r\n8.2 Laplace and Z Transforms\nLaplace transforms are an important tool for analysis of continuous time dynamic systems,\nand Z transforms are an important tool for analysis of discrete time dynamic systems. Im\nportant commands to manipulate these transforms are included in the following list.\nresidue(n,d)\nCompute the partial fraction expansion of the ratio of polynomials\nn(s)/d(s)\nlsim(SYS,u)\nCompute/plot the time response of SYS to the input vector u\nstep(SYS)\nCompute/plot the step response of SYS\nimpulse(SYS)\nCompute/plot the impulse response of SYS\npzmap(n,d)\nCompute/plot a pole-zero diagram of SYS\nresiduez(n,d) Compute the partial fraction expansion of the ratio of polynomials\nn(z)/d(z) written as functions of z-1\nrlocus(SYS)\nCompute/plot the root locus for a system whose open loop system is\nspecified by SYS\ndlsim(n,d,u)\nCompute the time response to the input vector u of the system with\nsystem function n(z)/d(z)\ndstep(n,d)\nCompute the step response of the system with system function\nn(z)/d(z)\ndimpulse(n,d) Compute the impulse response of the system with system function\nn(z)/d(z)\nzplane(z,p)\nPlot a pole-zero diagram from vectors of poles and zeros, p and z\nA number of these commands work with several specifications of the LTI system. One\nsuch specification is in terms of the transfer function for which 'SYS' is replaced with\n'TF(num,den)' where 'num' and 'den' are the vectors of coefficients of the numerator and\ndenominator polynomials of the system function.\n\n8.3 Frequency responses\nThere are several commands helpful for calculating and plotting frequency response given\nthe system function for continuous or discrete time systems as ratios of polynomials.\nbode(n,d)\nPlot the Bode diagram for a CT system whose system function is a the\nratio of polynomials n(s)/d(s)\nfreqs(n,d) Compute the frequency response for a CT system with system function\nn(s)/d(s)\nfreqz(n,d) Compute the frequency response for a DT system with system function\nn(z)/d(z)\n8.4 Fourier transforms and filtering\nThere is a rich collection of commands related to filtering. A few basic commands are listed\nhere.\nfft(x)\nCompute the discrete Fourier transform of the vector x\nifft(x)\nCompute the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the vector x\nfftshift\nShifts the fft output from the discrete range frequency range (0, 2π) to\n(-π, π) radians\nfilter(n,d,x)\nFilters the vector x with a filter whose system function is n(z)/d(z),\nincludes some output delay\nfiltfilt(n,d,x) Same as filter except without the output delay\nIn addition there are a number of filter design functions including firls, firl1, firl2,\ninvfreqs, invfreqz, remez, and butter. There are also a number of windowing functions\nincluding boxcar, hanning, hamming, bartlett, blackman, kaiser, and chebwin.\n9 Examples of Usage\n9.1 Find pole-zero diagram, bode diagram, step response from\nsystem function\nGiven a system function\ns\nH(s) = s2 + 2s + 101,\nMATLAB allows us to obtain plots of the pole-zero diagram, the Bode diagram, and the\nstep response.\n\n-6\n-4\n0.1\n-20\n0.08\n-40\n0.06\n-60\n0.04\n-80\nImag Axis\n-2\nPhase deg\nGain dB\n-0.06\n-8\n-90\n-10\n-1\n-0.9\n-0.8\n-0.7\n-0.6\n-0.5\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n-1\nReal Axis\n-0.08\n0.5\n1.5\n2.5\n3.5\n4.5\nFrequency (rad/sec)\nTime (secs)\nFigure 2: The plots were generated by the script and each plot was saved as an encapsulated\npostscript file.

A common example is to track the poles of a closed-loop\nfeedback system as the open loop gain is changed. For example, in the system shown in\nFigure 4, the closed loop gain is given by Black's formula as\nY (s)\nG(s)\nH(s) =\n=\n.\nX(s)\n1 + KG(s)\nIf G(s) is a rational function in s then it can be expressed as\n\n+\nG (s)\nK\nX(s) +\nY (s)\n-\nFigure 4: Feedback system with open loop gain\nG(s).\nImag Axis\nFigure 5: Root-locus plot of the poles of H(s)\nas K varies for G(s) = s/(s2 + 2s + 101).\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\nReal Axis\nN (s)\nG(s) = D(s)\nwhere N (s) and D(s) are polynomials. Solving for H(s) yields\nN (s)\nH(s) =\n.\nD(s) + KN (s)\nFinding the poles of H(s) as K changes implies finding the roots of the polynomial D(s) +\nKN (s) as K changes. Because this is such a common computation, MATLAB provides a\nfunction for computing the root locus conveniently called 'rlocus'. The following script\nplots the root locus for G(s)\ns\nG(s) =\n.\ns2 + 2s + 101\nnum = [1 0];\n%Define numerator polynomial\nden = [1 2 101];\n%Define denominator polynomial\nfigure(1);\nrlocus(num,den)\n%Plot root locus\nThe plot is shown in Figure 5. The root-locus plot can be customized in a manner similar\nto the example given above, see 'help rlocus'.\nThe command rlocus can be used in other contexts. For example, suppose we have a\nseries R, L, C circuit whose admittance is\ns\nY (s) = L s2 + Rs + 2,\nand we wish to obtain a plot of the locus of the poles (roots of the denominator polynomial)\nas the resistance R varies. It is only necessary to parse the denominator polynomial into two\nparts N (s) = s and D(s) = s2 + 2 and use 'rlocus' to obtain the plot.\n\nAmplitude\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nFigure 6: The input time function is a cos\ninusoid that starts at t = 0.\nThe out-\n-0.2\nput of an LTI system with system function\n-0.4\nH(s) = 5s/(s2 + 2s + 101) is shown in red.\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\nTime (s)\n9.3 Response of an LTI system to an input\nThe MATLAB command lsim makes it easy to compute the response of an LTI system with\nsystem function H(s) to an input x(t). Suppose\n5s\nH(s) = s2 + 2s + 101,\nand we wish to find the response to the input x(t) = cos(2πt) u(t). The following script\ncomputes and plots the response.\nfigure(1);\nnum = [5 0];\n%Define numerator polynomial\nden = [1 2 101];\n%Define denominator polynomial\nt = linspace(0, 10, 401); %Define a time vector\nu = cos(2*pi*t);\n%Compute the cosine input function\n[y,x] = lsim(num,den,u,t); %Compute the response to the input u at times t\nplot(t,y,'r',t,u,'b');\n%Plot the output in red and the input in blue\nxlabel('Time (s)');\nylabel('Amplitude');\nThe plot is shown in Figure 6.\n10 Acknowledgement\nThis document makes use of earlier documents prepared by Deron Jackson and by Alan\nGale."
