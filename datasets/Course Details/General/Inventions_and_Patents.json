And your comment that you really need them\npromptly to help formulate your desired thrust into study of the arena of patent law and\npatent office modernization and reform truly befitting today's widely varied technologies\nand their respective explosions and needs, sparked my enthusiasm to help immediately!\nAs Joanne put it, \"Our trip to Japan gives 14 uninterrupted hours to get started!\" (That's\nthe way she gets her Inventors' Digest magazine out on time!)\n\nAs I started to explain to you, my critique and ideas are certainly not to put more\n\"Band-Aids\" on our own current law and procedures though Joanne and I had something\nto do with keeping out of the American Inventors Protection Act of ' 99, patches that\nwould indeed have been quite septic to small inventors and entrepreneurs.\n\nNor am I the slightest bit interested in using the model of an out-dated, infirmly\nand inferiorly working European, Japanese and general world scenario in which foreign\ncountries are presently stymied, faring far more poorly then we in issuing prompt patents,\nand caught on their own pitard of \"absolute novelty\" (i.e. too late to patent if it is\npublished or shown on the market or at a trade show). They, indeed, have been\nstruggling for at least over four years as to how to adopt something from us that they\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nknow they badly need and think (erroneously) is akin to our one-year period of public\ntrial and use before filing--their so-called \"grace period\" proposal that has yet to see the\nlight of day. Such may permit late filing, but unlike our later-described interference\nprotection during our one-year marketing trial provision, and unlike our requirement for\nan oath as to original invention on penalty of invalidity, their so-called \"grace\" proposal\nlacks any protection whatsoever from stealth, claim-jump filing by others, and other\nabuses.\n\nWhen you said to us that you were starting afresh with no loyalties or obligations\nowed or committed to anyone, I was encouraged that maybe we can give you a\nperspective that I doubt that you can get anywhere else-- because just as you owe no one\nanything, neither do we.\n\nMy personal understanding and insights, moreover, have come from a very rare,\nvaried and long entrepreneurial background from one who has been (and still is)\nprivileged to operate in multi-faceted interdisciplinary professional activities. I lay these\nout not to boast, but to give you assurance that I've really seen and done what I'm talking\nabout.\n- Patent lawyer practitioner for over 55 years prosecuting U.S. and foreign\npatent applications (Europe, Mexico, South America, Canada, Middle East,\nScandinavia, Africa, India, Far East, Russia), and in diverse fields including\nelectrical, electronics, mechanics, robotics, computers, software, chemistry,\nelectro-chemistry, biology and microbiology, drugs, acoustics, etc.;\n- Court master in patent and trade secret litigation, mediator, and trial expert;\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\n- Patent licensing, technology transfer and joint venturing and new company\nlaunching world-wide;\n- Lead trial counsel for many years in patent litigation in many circuits in the\nUnited States and before the U.S. Supreme Court and in the Court of Claims,\nU.S. counsel in litigation in several foreign countries, including Canada, the\nUnited Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, among others;\n- Academic experience as lecturer and professor of patent law, and in several\ninstitutions including Harvard, Franklin Pierce Law Center, and MIT (where\nI've been on the lecturing faculty for almost 40 years and to the present) and\nspecial lecturer at foreign institutions in Europe and the Far East;\n- Governmental experience as patent examiner in the USPTO, and later as a\ncharter member (the only Republican) under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson\nof the Commerce Technical Advisory Board advising Congress on\ntechnology;\n- Member of the National Inventors Council;\n- Physicist (MIT) and inventor with over 90 U.S. patents in fields ranging from\nelectronics, (including internet software techniques) to fish farming and\nbiologicals and plant nutrients;\n- Inductee in the National Inventors Hall of Fame for imaging radar and\nultrasound imaging;\n- Inductee in the U.S. Army Signal Corps Wall of Fame, and earlier World\nWar II radar officer in European and Pacific theaters of operation, and U.S.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nSignal Corps director of radar beacon research at Anacostia, and liaison\nofficer with the Navy's Bureau of Ships;\n- Founder of the Franklin Pierce Law Center, Dean, Professor, President and\nChairman;\n- Founder of the Academy of Applied Science with its youth science and\ninvention-stimulating programs nationwide, and at 50 universities each year,\nsome in collaboration with the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force Research\nOffices, and Academy affiliation with the United Inventors Association of the\nUnited States;\n- Entrepreneur including launching several companies on my own patents\n(Megapulse Inc.--Loran-C navigation, Klein Associates--side scan sonar,\nNew England Fish Farming Enterprises, Inc.--salmon farming); and initial\npatent counsel for many start-up companies based on patents, including\nFortune 200 EG&G and BBN, among others.\nThis resume, as earlier stated, is not provided to boast or to impress--but only to\ngive you the assurance, when you want to compare my perspective with others, that I do\nknow what I'm talking about and from a diverse substantial first-hand life-long actual\nexperience.\nEven in my small law practice in Concord, New Hampshire, and Boston, I still\nprosecute a substantial number of patent applications all over the world, and can readily\nmake available to you and your staff, first-hand real comparative statistical information\n(with your viewing of files with our clients' permission) on all the facets of foreign\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nprosecution under their laws and procedures, and as compared to the prosecution of the\ncorresponding U.S. applications on the very same inventions.\nThis current experience I have continually supplemented by research projects of\nmy MIT graduate students each year, so that I am totally confident that what I say here\ninvolves provable facts, or opinions based thereon. They will never embarrass you, the\nPatent Office, the Congress--or me.\nIn your formulating of your own views, you will undoubtedly hear from foreign\nand some of our own bureaucrats and U.S. large corporation and lobbying lawyers, and\nsometimes technical associations that generally received one-sided information only from\nthese parties. While there is substance to some of their views, this is usually offered in\nthe interest of their clients to whom, invariably, I have consistently found they tell only\npart of the story. I believe this is in part because they have a continual fear of the\nbothersome and often far more prodigious and path-breaking inventions of America's\nindependent inventors, university inventors and start-up and other small-business\nentrepreneurial firms. \"What's good for General Motors,\" however, is often bad for this\nconstituency of our inventors, as I will later demonstrate for you--and this constituency,\nat least in its relative size and historical and current importance to American innovation,\nis largely, or even totally, absent in the rest of the world operating under very different\npatent procedures and laws.\nWhile the large international companies (I no longer consider them truly\n\"American\" companies) differ in their lobbying objectives from the small inventive\nbusiness and university constituencies, since they already are forced to live under the\nEuropean and Japanese systems--I do not believe you'll find anyone amongst them who\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nwould challenge either my integrity or my total facts--they just don't want to hear, having\npre-determined their objectives.\nDoes that sound familiar to you?\nI admired your record for seeking the truth and for your appreciation of the vital\nimportance of the sanctity of representations under oath, and the importance, for our\nsystem to work, of consequences for violation of oath, and your record of willingness for\npersonal sacrifice in what you believed to be in the best interests of our country.\nI'm sure you also don't want a patent system for our country that would violate\nthese principles.\nIt is now in order, therefore, to examine the \"facts\" about our present system in\ncontradistinction to that of the rest of the world.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nChapter Two\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nAmerica came to its philosophy of a patent system from a very different\nperspective than European countries and, indeed, different also from the rationale of the\nrest of the world.\nFully aware of the successful British experience with encouraging the importation\nof new technologies and products by the offering of a limited grant from the crown of the\nexclusive opportunity to promote in the realm, with ultimate check upon the power of the\ncrown to extend such exclusivity for other than a limited time, and then only for a\nproduct or craft previously not present in or known to the realm, the Constitutional\nframers none-the-less chose to reject aspects of the English philosophy behind the grant\nof a patent for such importation. That philosophy was and still is predicated on the\nproposition that the crown should not have to make any such exclusive grants if the\ntechnology or product is already known or present in the realm.\nIt has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual creator or discoverer of an\ninvention or a new idea and is, and always has been, blind to and totally unconcerned\nwith the actual creator, let alone any equities residing in the individual creator. It is only\nthe desire to get new commercial ideas into the country that underlay and still underlies\nthe British and now European and world patent systems, releasing the governments from\nany requirement to grant a patent if the idea was already present in the country.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nThis continues to this very day in the British (European) and world-wide doctrine\nof \"absolute novelty\" that bars a patent if there has been even a single instance of public\ninformation, presence or disclosure of the idea before an application for patent has been\nfiled--even activity by the creator of the idea. This doctrine underlies the \"first-to-file\"\nphilosophy of the world patent systems, which the United States deliberately rejected in\nthe launching of our patent system, and still rejects. The rest of the world, since the\nAmerican union, has used the first-to-file concept and it has consistently produced results\nin every category one chooses to measure--invention, entrepreneurship, jobs, commerce,\netc.--inferior to what the American patent system, based on our distinctively different\nphilosophy, has historically produced and presently continues to produce with an ever-\nwidening gap from all the rest of the world put together!\nThe Colonial forefathers saw a real human face in a discovery or invention--the\nreal, live human being behind the creator. While certainly desiring to have the incentive\nfor importation of new ideas, they wished strongly to encourage also the making of\ndiscoveries and the spawning of new commercially useful ideas and technologies (then\ntermed the \"useful arts\") from within the country as well. Nor were the forefathers\nconcerned with just floating ideas per se. To the contrary, they sought to spark actual\ninnovation and actual entrepreneurship--not at all the mere filing of a piece of paper to\nblock others. The Federalist Papers clearly demonstrate to me, indeed, that the drafters\nwere really concerned with innovation--the starting of new industries, jobs and exports--\nnot the mere institutional publication of a brainstorm such as a Michelangelo painting of\na dream.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nFrom our very Constitutional beginnings, indeed, unlike the rest of the world, that\namazing group of Constitutional drafters had humanized the creative and inventive\nprocesses, recognizing that it was actually individuals who made creations, and that they\nshould be encouraged to turn these into useful, commercial business, though at their own\nrisk and finances; and that, for its part, the role of government was to provide an\ninstrument to secure them from copied competition for a limited period of time.\nThere were, indeed, among the framers some who themselves had been creators\nand builders of useful new devices of their own, and they could relate to the realities and\nproblems of commercialization and the need for a legal system that recognized the real-\nworld circumstances of invention, business formation, manufacture and marketing.\nIn this recognization, unlike the British bureaucratic philosophy, the\nConstitutional provision for patents and the laws enacted by even the very first Congress\nin pursuance thereof, historically reflected numerous novel laws specifically tailored to\nthe real-world needs of the invention, development and marketing world, and that find\nabsolutely no counterpart either in the British system of our Colonial period or in the\nbasically same type of system currently used in the rest of the world.\nAmong these, which I shall elaborate upon a bit later, are our concept that the\ninventor -- instead of being forced to live in the world of claim-jumping -- should be\nencouraged to perfect the invention before filing an application in the Patent Office. This\nalso protected the Patent Office from having to treat with only partially-baked ideas and\nhaving to deal with the problems of numerous subsequent changes and multiple patent\napplications therefor as the commercial product was developed.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nHow to perfect -- how to refine to what customers really need and want? Only\none real-world way. Try it out in the marketplace! At least get opinions and experience\nwith prototypes in the real world that allow for the invariably required practical changes\nfor working properly and/or meeting the potential customers' real needs.\nHence, we created a law that provides for up to a year (it used to be two years) of\npublic use, test marketing, even initial sales, before you are required to file the U.S.\npatent application. Our philosophy, quite contrary to the rest of the world even as it was\nin our Colonial times and still is, was to encourage the completing of a practical,\ncommercially useful and marketable product which is to be fully described in the patent\napplication, instead of a hurried half-baked approach forced by the requirement to rush to\nget something on file before you are claim-jumped by another.\nOur legal system is the only one ever designed with the sophistication to match\nthe real-world needs of invention and technological engineering and development and\nmarket-testing procedures with supporting legal provisions that recognize these real-\nworld development requirements and are tailored therefor - a recognition found nowhere\nelse in the rest of the claim-jumping world.\nBut this is only half the cake.\nOur American legal wisdom has recognized and still recognizes that having a year\nof public testing is of little value (like the current proposals in Europe to copy our so -\ncalled \"grace period\" by which they mean something very different from our concept)\nunless the inventor has protection from stealing, copying and even claim-jumping into the\nPatent Office by those who are stimulated by seeing the publicly exposed invention in\nthis test marketing period. Without the opportunity of the inventor to prove when he or\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nshe actually made the invention (as distinguished from when the perfected U.S. patent\napplication is filed), the danger and risk of public disclosure and testing is intolerable.\nStill again, our law--as distinguished from that of any other land--provides the\nconcept of protection by providing for interference proceedings that can afford the\nopportunity for the real inventor and innovator to make use of the one-year public use,\ntesting and perfecting provision without interference by the stealth or claim jumping of\nanother.\nWithout this feature, the currently proposed \"grace period\" idea of Europe, which\nthey still can't find a way to incorporate into their kind of system, while it may permit\nlate filing in Europe, can only leave open the opportunity for stealing and intolerable risk\nto the inventor, since the first-to-file gets the patent willy, nilly under their system.\nAnd our law, again in trying to match to the real-world needs of technological\ndevelopment, has provided still a further unique feature unknown elsewhere,\nsophisticatedly recognizing that there are some circumstances where the only way an\ninvention can be tested is by using and testing it sufficiently long in public -- and so we\nhave an exception to the \"one year\" public use rule for the case of truly experimental use\nin public (not commercial) to determine the commercial utility of an invention of the type\nrequiring longer-term public testing for proof of such utility.\nAll of this developed, moreover, from our Constitutional provision (Article I,\nSection 8) that uses language reflecting our distinctive American philosophy that\ncontinues widely to outperform the world.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nFirst, our patent laws are not at all concerned with the very primary concern of\nforeign patent laws - -namely, absolving the state from having to grant patents in an\ninvention that entered the state even trivially, before the application is filed.\nOur Constitution rather instructs Congress, to the contrary, to promote the\nprogress of the useful arts. It then tells Congress how to do this; by securing to inventors\nfor limited times the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\nThe only other place in the Constitution that, at this writing, I can recall where\nindividual \"rights\" are even mentioned, is in the Bill of Rights; and I do not recollect\nwhere any specific profession has been singled out in the Constitution as entitled to\nspecial \"rights\" additional to those of all citizens under the Bill of Rights - -namely,\nunder Article I, Section 8, \"inventors\" and \"authors\".\nThe provisions mandate Congress to secure these rights to inventors and in an\nexclusive form for a limited time.\nIt is quite evident to me, at least, that there is no way Congress is authorized to\ngive exclusive rights to anyone who cannot be classified as the inventor,-- a word that\nhas been clearly used from at least the time of the Federalist Papers, and through over\n200 years of court and administrative agency decisions, and in the legal practice, social\nand commercial life, and with language understanding, that unambiguously means the\nactual original creator of the discovery -- and no one else. If someone is not the original\ncreator, but only the first to file a piece of paper with a description, this cannot, in my\nview, meet the clear language and intent of the Constitutional provision.\nThis is the more so, because the Constitution itself specifically defines the\n\"inventor\" as the one who actually made the \"discoveries.\" Clearly to flout this further\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\ndistinctive qualification by trying to equate this requirement for a discovery with the\nmere filing of a piece of paper, is also ridiculous.\nIn short, even if Congress and lawyers can play games that \"black\" is \"white\" in\nother contexts, they still cannot, in my view, Constitutionally or historically twist the\nwords \"inventors\" and \"discoveries\" to mean other than what over 200 years of American\nusage and precedent have said they mean -- and that most American kindergarten\nchildren could tell you they mean.\nEven if, accordingly, the great roseate of the world would be that America join the\ninferior patent systems of the world by scrapping \"inventor\" and \"discovery,\" we would\nstill need radically to amend Article I Section 8 to accomplish such a result.\nOnce done, moreover, we would be stripping away from the most advanced legal\nsystem in the world, its far-sighted, sensitive and superior insights in providing legal\nmechanisms that are truly tailored to the real-world needs and customs of technological\ndevelopment and innovation and that have produced results that outstrip the rest of the\nworld - - and all for the convenience of bureaucrats whose limit of desired exertion seems\nto reside in keeping track of the date and time stamps at the world's Patent Offices --,\nand also for the \"benefit\" of large multi-nationals who presently are forced to live under\nthe inferior foreign patent systems of the rest of the world, and seem determined that all\nothers should have to share in their \"harmonizing\" misery, too.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nChapter 3\nHow Inventions Are Made, Developed And Protected By Patent Application\nFiling In The United States\n\nThe process of real-world invention, and the developing and protecting of\ninventions in the United States is, in great part, quite uniquely different from the rest of\nthe world. Our Congress and Courts have accordingly long recognized the need\ncorrespondingly to provide a legal system with special rules, doctrines and customs --\nindeed totally foreign to foreigners -- especially created to match the actual real-world\nneeds of the American culture of invention and the development and entrepreneuring of\nthe same, which has been so startlingly successful, and light years beyond the results\nproduced under foreign laws.\nThe Elements of \"Invention\"\n\nWhether stimulated by purposeful design to make something better, or a dream or\na hunch, or a serendipitous or accidental discovery with astute recognition of its potential,\nor otherwise, the making of an invention basically initially always first requires a total\nconception of the product idea, formulation or process-to-be.\n\nUnder American culture and Constitutional intent, however, we have never\nconsidered a mere conceiver to be an inventor; and certainly not that mere conception,\nhas actually progressed \"the useful arts\" for the actual benefit of society.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nTo the distinct contrary, we have always required the mere idea person or\nconceiver to proceed much further to the stage of developing proof of principal or actual\nreduction to practice1 of the discovery in order to rise to the level of an \"inventor\".\n\nThe United States Patent Office, indeed, used to require at least the development\nof working models before qualifying a patent applicant as a potential inventor; and even\ntoday, our patent examiners often still require evidence of workability or actual results,\nand under oath and sometimes with corroboration.\n\nAnd this is exactly in tune with the real world of invention. Desks full of sketches\nand conceptions that do not find their way into working products or processes for the\nmarketplace, provide no benefit to the public, no commercial reward for the conceiver,\nnor any recognition by our legal system, and such certainly do nothing tangible to fulfill\nour Constitutional purpose of progressing \"the useful arts\". They may be quite suited,\nhowever, for a first-to-filer.\n\nThus, in the real world, an inventor proceeds after conception to the development\nof early models and prototypes -- to the actual building and testing and modifying and re-\ntesting that is, in practice, required to arrive at a potentially useful and workable product\nor process.\n_______________________\n1. I am here ignoring the fact the we unfortunately do also permit mere \"paper patents\";\nequating since at least the Bell Telephone Cases, the theoretical portraying of an idea in a\npatent application as the legal \"equivalent\" of an actual reduction to practice - - a\nlawyers' I think, lousy \"invention\" of the purely legalistic concept of so-called\n\"constructive reduction to practice\" by filing a patent application. I know, however, of\nno new companies or jobs that such legal machinations have produced, and fortunately\nthe Courts give them very limited scope and importance in practice.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nIt is to the rewarding of the completion of this special latter effort -- not stopping\nat mere conception -- that the American patent laws were specifically designed to\nencourage. It is the making of real contributions to the progress of useful arts and the\nencouraging of risk-taking in the launching of new technologies, businesses, jobs and\nexports, that have been defining and still increasingly define America's vastly superior\nperformance over the rest of the world.\n\nNot only does the real inventor demonstrate and test the prototype in private, but\nthe inventor and backers have the further real-world necessity before risking capital, to\nreceive feed-back as to the potential commercial viability of the prototype in the\nmarketplace--questions such as can it compete favorably with what's out there; is it in the\nform that users want or need and indicate they will buy; what is the reaction at trade\nshows, etc.; does it need to be changed, modified or improved to make it actually\ncommercially useful, and/or to meet the real practical requirements of potential\ncustomers, instead of those perceived or guessed-at by the inventor?\n\nA patent, despite how foreigners may often look at it, is not just a piece of paper;\nit represents the real opportunity for entrepreneurship if properly granted and used.\n\nAmerica, unlike the rest of the world, has accordingly always recognized that\nthere is absolutely no way to answer these questions without actual test marketing; and it\nhas always been America's unique philosophy to encourage the inventor to perfect the\ninvention for the marketplace and thus for the real benefit of the public; and not just to\nblindly proceed with the first crude idea and leap into the Patent Office.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nMore than this, America, once more totally unlike the rest of the world, has\ndeliberately and specifically tailored its laws to encourage the inventor not to jump into\nthe Patent Office with the first crude or hasty approach; but, to the very contrary,\ndiligently to refine the invention as initial market and public use experience dictates --\nand then only to file in the Patent Office the most finished and \"best mode\" of realization\nof the invention as possible, though within statutory time constraints.\nTest Marketing Essentials\n\nIn order to achieve the benefit of this technological and economic necessity of\nfeed-back that underpins the real world of invention development and marketing--and\nagain as distinguished from foreign claim-jumping into the Patent Offices with rushed\nconceptions and/or first crude attempts, under penalty of losing all--our law not only\nprovides for such a public use and marketing test period, but it provides such without\npenalty and with protection against stealth. We protect the inventor's dates of actual\ninvention during that period from those who would try to steal, or are stimulated\nthemselves to file on \"improvements\" that may actually also be within the inventor's\npresent contemplation and records, and that are ultimately to be presented in the\ninventor's patent application.\n\nAt inventors' and engineering conferences over the past years, throughout the\ncountry, I have personally encountered tens of large company inventors who decry their\ninability to take advantage of America's legal understanding of these real needs of the\ninnovation process, because their employers require adhering to the rules of the European\nand Japanese laws under which they heavily trade. Though their legal departments deny\nus direct questionnaire access to their inventors, my MIT students and I are accumulating\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\ntheir views -- painfully slowly -- by oral interviews and public meetings where their\nemployers are not present. I have yet, however, to meet my first large company inventor\nwho is happy with half-baked patent applications his or her employers spew out with\ntheir army of patent lawyers and patent engineers, under the pressure of the \"first-to-file\"-\n\"absolute novelty\" system requirements.\n\nAs for university inventors, I have documented many academic inventors and\ncolleagues, all over the country, who either ignore their institution's efforts to force hasty\napplication filing before they hold public seminars, demonstrations, or discussions with\npeers, or who just do not disclose their private developments until they are themselves\nsatisfied with their testing and refining in light of feed-back from colleagues, including\noutside the institution. They refuse largely to publish half-baked papers, and many\nregard 18-month publication of rushed patent applications to be in this category, and\noften even do not want their names or reputations associated with such.\n\nAt the numerous independent and small-business conferences that my wife Joanne\non behalf of her Inventors' Digest and I attend, we find that almost everyone has rejected\nthe concept of living under the European and Japanese first-to-file, absolute novelty\nrules; and almost no one of that constituency now even files abroad, just because they do\nnot perceive that it is worth it to them to lose the immunity from 18-month publication\nand the other protections and benefits of the current American system.\n\nHaving just returned from Japan, moreover, Joanne and I were amazed to learn\nfrom our Japanese patent associates, of their clients' frustration in losing out, in what they\nestimated to be about 30% of the time, to first-to-file claim jumpers of inventions that\nthey had been earlier diligently developing.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nLet us now examine the legal system that America invented and has most\nsuccessfully time-tested, to match the needs of real-world innovation with\ncomplementary legal principles.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nChapter 4\nOur Legal System Predicated On The First To Invent, Not The First To Claim-Jump\n[Comparison With First-To-File Foreign Systems]\n\nI have earlier described why I am convinced of the unconstitutionality of a\nlegislative fiat that black is white; i.e. that the first to file is necessarily and immutably\nthe first inventor.\n\nPursuant to over 200 years of Constitutional interpretation, the unanimous.\ndecisions of all the Courts of this land, and the unanimous American definitions and\ninterpretations of the word \"inventor\" (including by schoolchildren, as before stated), the\nCongress, the Patent Office and the Courts have operated under the following specially\ntailored laws and customs throughout our history -- and to the great benefit of our society\nand the world in general:\n\nU.S.A:\nFIRST, for the integrity of our\nsystem, we require that the inventor:\n\nA. Personally and as an individual,\nmust file and sign the patent\napplication.\n\nB. The inventor must make a\nwritten oath or statutory\ndeclaration that the invention is\n\"original\" with the applicant,\nand that the applicant believes he\nor she is such original, true, and\nsole (or joint) inventor, - - all\nunder pain and penalties of\nperjury, and all under the further\nconsequence of a holding of\ninvalidity of the application and\nany patent that may issue\ntherefrom.\n\nFOREIGN: None of these requirements\nof A, B, C or D in any first-to-file\ncountry.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nC. The applicant must also\nrepresent (again under oath or\ndeclaration) the lack of\nknowledge of prior invention by\nothers, or of publication or\npublic use or prior patenting by\nanyone more than one year\nbefore filing.\n\nD. The applicant must acknowledge\nin writing the duty to\ndisclose pertinent prior art\nand activities and to\nacknowledge the inventor's duty\nof candor before the Patent\nOffice.\nNon-existent.\n\nU.S.A: SECOND, the patent applicant,\nas earlier mentioned, is afforded\na period of one year from first\npublic exposure of the invention\n-- public use, public disclosure,\nmarketing, sale or offer for sale\nor lease, publication, or other\npublic dissemination -- in which\nto file the U.S. patent\napplication.\n\nFOREIGN: Non-existent. Even a single\npublic exposure of any kind\nwhatsoever before filing the\napplication is a total bar to the\npatent - so-called \"absolute\nnovelty\" - - i.e. knowledge\npublicly imparted in the\ncountry before application\nfiling, no matter how trivially.\n\nU.S.A: THIRD, as an accompanying\nessential corollary to the one-\nyear public disclosure provision,\ninterference proceeding\nprotection against copying,\nstealth or re-invention by others,\nor stimulation to file on the part\nof others who see the product on\nthe market or hear a lecture or\nsee a publication during the one-\nyear public use period.\n\nFOREIGN: Non-existent. They really do\nnot care how the filer derived\nthe \"invention.\" They require\nno information whatsoever, let\nalone an oath as to the origin\nof the invention. Their\nbureaucracy has absolutely no\nconcern with any inventors'\n\"rights.\"\n\nWithout this interference protection, the one-year public marketing or publication\nperiod, above, is only an invitation to copying, stealth, fraud, and the possible depriving\nof the inventor of improvement protection in contemplation. [This is one of the reasons\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nwhy Europe is still struggling with how to institute a so-called \"grace period\" that they\nnow realize is essential in the face of their current admittedly inadequate first-to- file\nexperience.]\nU.S.A:\nFOURTH, for those types of\ninventions that by their nature\nrequire a longer testing in public\nfor proof of utility, we long ago\nevolved an experimental (not-\nfor-profit), public use exception\nto the one-year rule -- again a\nrecognition by our law of the\nneeds of real-world\ntechnological development. This\nstarted with a highway case\nwhere the determination of the\nutility and potential life of the\nroad in actual public carriage use\ncould not be determined within\nthe statutory two-year period of\npublic use that was then allowed\nbefore filing.\n\nU.S.A:\nFIFTH, a sophisticated\nconcern, under our\nConstitutional mandate of\npromoting the useful arts, for\nencouraging quality and\ncommercial usefulness of\ninvention, by affording\nreasonable time (with\ninterference process protection)\nfor diligent development and\nperfecting before filing the\npatent application -- in direct\ncontradistinction to a race to the\nPatent Office. This is entirely\nconsonant and harmonious with\nthe way engineering and\nacademia actually do their real-\nworld work.\n\nFOREIGN: Non-existent. Totally blind\nand callous to the real\nneeds of technological\ndevelopment. Don't care.\n\nFOREIGN: Non-existent. Of absolutely\nno concern. The race to the\nPatent Office is the end all.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nOur system makes it possible for academic and other researchers diligently to\nperfect their inventions in the normal processes of research and development, and not to\nbe in danger of being totally wiped out by a new-comer's quick and perhaps only\ntheoretical filing.\nU.S.A: SIXTH, as a corollary of the\nitem immediately above, and\nin our encouragement of\nquality and utility, our\nsystem positively\ndiscourages the filing of\nsketchy, incomplete, half-\nbaked, hurried disclosures\nby:\nA. A legal requirement for a\nfull and complete and clear\ndisclosure and patent\nclaiming, totally adequate\nfor one skilled in the art to\nunderstand and practice the\ninvention; and\nB. A strict legal requirement\neven for teaching of the\n\"best mode\" of\nimplementation of the\ninvention known to the\ninventor.\nFOREIGN: No such requirements.\nMuch more sketchy and\nless detailed disclosures\nroutinely accepted and\nindeed often inherent in the\nfirst-to-file world. U.S.\nexaminers considering\nsuch foreign applications\nwhen filed as a\ncorresponding U.S.\nconvention patent\napplication counterpart,\nfrequently reject them as\nincomplete, insufficient\nand inadequate disclosures\nunder our law. No\napparent concern for the\npractice of multiple\nsubsequent filings to try to\nbolster first-to-file\napplications hastily\nconcocted on peril of\nforeclosure\n\nOur law is also calculated not only to avoid the necessity for multiple successive\nmodification filings for bolstering the sufficiency of the originally conceived idea, but to\ndiscourage flooding the Patent Office with such supplementary improvement filings with\nthe concurrent resulting adding to the backlog of the examining corps.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nU.S.A:\nSEVENTH, our law further\nrecognizes the real-world\ndifficulty in the early\nformulating of patent claims\nfor new ideas and that must\navoid world-wide prior art,\nbut that still offer adequate\nand proper protection for\nwhat often only time will\nultimately reveal more\nclearly as the proper scope\nof the invention. Our\nsystem, accordingly,\nprovides equitable remedies.\n[England, that once had the\ngenius to create \"equity,\" has\nnow in my view a genius-\nless generation which\napparently has chosen to\ndiscard \"equity\" in\ndeference to wearing the\n\"same suit\" as their\nneighbors on the Continent].\nFOREIGN: No such considerations.\n\"Equity\" is not in their lives.\nThe state does not allow for\ninadvertent mistakes or for the\nreal-world fact that the full\nscope of the initial invention\nin its infancy is not always\nimmediately self-evident.\n\nThe U.S., more sensitively and understandingly, provides equitable remedies by\nway of reissue proceedings to correct real and honest errors in claim scope (broader or\nnarrower); and re-examination proceedings for similar purposes including inadvertently\nover-claiming or under-claiming and also for public protection from the Patent Office\ninadvertently missing more pertinent prior art.\n\nOur patent law (and, indeed, our law in all fields) conducts itself far differently\nfrom the literal formalistic strictness philosophy and conduct of Continental countries --\nbeing rather postured in real substantative considerations not strictly form; indeed, with\nconcern for balancing the equities of the inventor's proper and adequate protection\nagainst the right of the public not to be penalized by an inventor's initial mistaken\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nclaiming. That said, our law recognizes the practical difficulties in using mere words\n(claims) adequately to describe very complex concepts, and from different points of view\n--and all at the inventor's peril. If the inventor inadvertently over claims [and who, in the\nbeginning, can always be so clairvoyant as fully to appreciate the total scope of the infant\ninvention], the Court will invalidate the patent. If the inventor under claims, the world is\nfree to get around and appropriate the invention. And, of course, the inventor has the\nfurther burden of being charged legally with the actually impossible and mythical task of\n\"knowing\" everything that is known in the world.\nThe strictly American philosophy of enabling reissue or re-examination to rescue\ncorrect claim scope, while protecting the rights of the public that relied on the original\npatent claims as issued, is another novel American doctrine pursuant to the Constitutional\nmandate that Congress, in furthering its charge to promote the progress of the useful arts,\nis instructed by the Constitution to do so by \"securing\" to inventors the \"exclusive rights\"\nto their \"discoveries.\"\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nChapter Five\n\nThe Very Different Inventive Communities In The United States And Abroad\n\nPursuant to the climate created by the above at least seven American legal\nprovisions by which our legal system strives to aid and indeed match the real-world needs\nof invention, innovation and entrepreneurship in prosecuting patent applications in the\nPatent Office, these sophisticated, carefully crafted, proven, time-tested and honed legal\nprovisions have enabled America vastly to outperform and continue to outperform the\nwhole world put together, by any measures one cares to define.\n\nOur system has given rise to an extraordinary and unique community of\nindependent inventors, largely absent elsewhere as earlier noted, and certainly absent in\nthe relative size and importance of activity and innovation achieved by America's\nindependent inventors.\n\nThe attempt by the Patent Office to measure the independent inventor community\nsize by counting only the number of applications filed in personal names, as distinguished\nfrom those being shown as assigned to corporations, simply fails to appreciate the real\nworld wherein today most individual inventors form their own infant corporations to\nwhich they assign their applications.\n\nBut even the 25 percent size acknowledged by the Patent Office \"statistics,\"\nperhaps even half again greater, does not reflect the modern story of America's\nindependent inventors and their small businesses that are responsible for much of the\nbreak-through inventions and a disproportionate share of the more significant inventions.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nThey truly still follow the same tradition as their independent inventor forebears, such as\nFulton, Whitney, Edison, Bell, the Wright brothers and our other old folk heroes. Today\nand in the recent past, while their names may not be household words, the contributions\nof the independent inventors (not the large corporations) include the ATM, the World-\nWide Web, the implantable pacemaker, the MRI, the laser, the Apple computer, the PC-\nDOS computer operating system, the digital compact disc, the disposable diaper, Gore-\ntex fabric, the jet ski, the snowboard, the supercomputer, the \"Walkman,\" the electronic\ncalculator, \"Power Bars,\" and quite recently, the interesting \"Segway\" scooter, to mention\nbut a very few.\n\nIn recognition of this prodigious performance, our Patent Office, and to my\nunderstanding no other Patent Office in the world, has developed a special office for\nindependent inventors in recognition of their special needs.\n\nIncluded in this important independent and small business inventive community,\nmoreover, is the university inventor community -- particularly those who also\nentrepreneur their own new businesses spun off from their academic activities--also a\nlargely American phenomenon, and certainly in the large extent that we have developed.\n\nAnd it is these strictly American phenomena that feed the large corporations with\nnew technological thrusts and that refurbish and grow the large companies and indeed\nkeep them surviving, as they buy-up the entrepreneurial developments of the small\ninnovative enterprises launched on the backs of independent invention, and then\ncontribute their talent in mass production and world-wide marketing.\n\nReally, in this invention arena, the only thing that America has in common with\nthe rest of the world is their large multi-national corporations. They today must live\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nabroad under the rules of foreign patent systems. While they understandingly\naccordingly urge one universal set of harmonious rules for patent application filings and\nprosecution for their comfort, this would grievously be inimical to the different needs of\nAmerica's independent, small-business, academic inventive and entrepreneurial\ncommunities who both historically and presently thrive under our very different\nAmerican rules.\n\nIt should be noted, moreover, that the large corporations have also their economic\nmight and muscle to compete, and now generally, perhaps with the exception of\npharmaceuticals and the like, do not today belabor the \"exclusive\" feature of the patents;\nwhereas the independent, small business and academic communities only have the\nexclusive patent rights as their protection to compete and, indeed, even get started.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nChapter Six\nThe Large Corporate And Some Bureaucratic Whining For \"Harmonization\"\n\nLet us examine some of the \"rationale\" for so-called \"harmonization\" that we hear\nadvanced by the \"big boys,\" remembering that by \"harmonization,\" they mean we jettison\nour system and adopt foreign laws -- not that the world adopts the best of theirs and the\nbest of ours:\n1.\nThe first-to-invent philosophy is out of step with the rest of the world.\n2.\nIn the interest of uniformity, we should have one universal set of patent\nlaws.\n3.\nThe protections required for first-to-invent, including interference practice\nto determine the real first inventor in the event of overlapping or\ninterfering applications, is too costly, and time-consuming, and is only for\nthe benefit of a tiny percentage of patent applicants; being further an\ninordinate burden on the Patent Office.\n4.\nThe \"first-to-file\" system economically solves all these \"problems.\"\nLet's discuss these points.\n1. and 2. Considering, first, being \"out-of-step\" with the rest of the world and\nsecondly, the quest for \"uniformity\"--it is not out of place to point out that so is\nour Constitutional Bill of Rights and the resulting extent of our freedoms \"out-of-\nstep,\" and far from \"uniform\" with their systems.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nNo thinking or knowledgeable American would ever want to swap. This,\nindeed, is the very reason why America is the greatest, most free, and most\nproductive land in the world.\n3.\nTurning to the American processes for determining the real inventor,\nrather than adopting a bureaucracy-simplifying fiat that the first to win a claim-\njumping race to the Patent Office is automatically the inventor, it has been earlier\nshown herein that:\nA. Our Constitution, in Article I, Section 8, demands \"securing\" exclusive\n\"rights\" to the actual \"inventors\" of the actual \"discoveries,\" as those\nwords were precisely crafted in the context of the Federalist Papers\nand discussions and have been used with unanimous interpretation by\nall our Courts since the beginning of the Constitution to the very\npresent. Apart from the Bill of Rights, Article I, Section 8 is the only\nother place in the Constitution where, as earlier noted, the word\n\"rights\" is used, and certainly the only place where a specific\nprofession has been singled out for such special \"rights\"; namely,\n\"inventors\" (and \"authors\").\nB. As earlier shown in the seven features of our law detailed above, we,\nnot the rest of the world, have carefully created and matched legal\nprotections in patent application prosecution to the actual real-world\nway in which invention, engineering, technological development and\nmarketing naturally occur and are conducted, across the board --with\nindependent, small and start-up business, and academic inventive\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\ncommunities alike -- and even, subject to their being un-naturally\nstraight-jacketed by foreign patent law considerations, by the inventors\nof the large corporations, as well.\nC. I have personally lived through a long course of the earlier\ncumbersome, expensive, time-consuming, legally ritualistic past era of\ninterference practice for many clients, and long before that, briefly as\nan Examiner. Unlike many patent lawyer colleagues of my present\nage in the large corporate sector who are today urging the \"first-to-file\"\nroseate, however, I am still actively engaged in current interference\npractice on behalf of small-business clients. I can personally and\npositively state that the modernized interference practice of today,\nusing affidavits (not testimony), expedited time schedules, and simple\nprocedures, has made the process straight-forward, inexpensive and\nquick (the interference judges simply don't stand for delaying tactics!).\nMost recently, I obtained a final decision of first inventorship\nover the first filer for my later-filing clients in less than a year from the\ninstituting of the interference.\nD. The record on current interference practice compiled by my MIT\ngraduate students, shows, moreover, that in more than 25% of the\ncases, the later-filing applicant won all the claims as the true first\ninventor over the earlier first-to-file; and in an additional 30% of the\ncases, the later-filing applicant was declared the true first inventor of at\nleast some of the claims, over the first-to-file. Thus, in half or more of\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nthe cases, the real inventor would have been deprived of a patent to\nwhich the Constitution assures entitlement, had we lived under a first-\nto-file environment.\n4.\nThe economic \"benefit\" of first-to-file is perhaps the proponents' worst\nargument.\nWhile these interferences involve only a very small percent of pending patent\napplications, they represent absolutely the only safeguard of an inventor's\nConstitutionally mandated \"rights\"--\"rights\" that, as actually shown, are neither\nmandated, nor of concern in the state policies and patent laws of the rest of the world.\nAmerica, indeed, unlike the rest of the world, is and always has been vitally concerned\nwith the preservation of individual rights over the state. It is no excuse in our way of life,\nfor the state to argue abridgement of individual rights upon economic, budgeting, or any\nother grounds, and certainly not on grounds of alleged efficiency.\nBecause the police obtain criminal convictions in the 90 percentile, is no\nAmerican excuse for abridging the \"right\" to full due process, irrespective of expense--or\ninefficiency, on the ground that this is just for the benefit of a small percentage (in this\ncase, the innocent).\nNor can the tactics of bureaucrats be tolerated in equating budgetary costs with\nindividual \"rights\" under American culture. This, the more so, particularly where it is\nsolely the inventors and not the public (and certainly not a single one of these\nbureaucrats), who contribute the funds for the sole support of the Patent Office, and do so\non the understanding that they are supporting interference, reissue and re-examination\nsafeguards of their \"rights\" with their very own money.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nChapter Seven\n\nThe Folly Of So - Called \"Harmonization\"\n\nThe whole world, since the time of our Constitution to the present, save later\nCanada and the Philippines, has been a \"first-to-file\" world. This first-to-file concept,\nhowever, was certainly not, as some think, created by the European patent law and later\nthe Japanese and other foreign country patent laws after World War II. It is, in fact,\nnothing new at all!!\nIts corollary of the \"absolute novelty\" restriction requiring no prior knowledge or\npublication before filing, is also centuries-old in some countries.\nThe proof of the pudding, it has been said, is in the eating.\nWell, what have the first-to-file-absolute novelty patent systems of Europe and\nthe rest of the world -- also tested over the past 200 years since our American\nConstitution -- got to show for themselves in comparison with the results attained under\nthe American system pursuant to our Constitution?\n\nLesser standards of living.\n\nLesser innovation.\n\nLesser businesses, and lesser small businesses.\n\nLesser freedoms.\n\nLesser choices.\n\nLesser independent inventor and academic inventive communities.\n\nLesser technologically based start-up companies.\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nLesser academic technology spin-off, new enterprises.\n\nLonger times from actual filing to grant of patents.\n\nGreater numbers of patent bureaucrats.\nGreater fees and cost to inventors including by much heavier and annual\ntaxes.\n\nNeed I say more?\nWhy should we even want to contemplate joining the losing team?\nAnd perhaps the most telling bit of \"harmonization\" nonsense in my opinion is,\nwhat good does a \"harmonized\" set of rules for obtaining patents do, when once a patent\nissues from a Patent Office, there are such hopeless unharmonized differences of legal\nenforcement rules, customs and even integrity in the other communities of the world?\nAre we also to be asked to \"harmonize\" our legal court enforcement system by\nstripping away still other Constitutional guarantees in addition to Article I, Section 8?\nIf so, with which of the \"Heinz 57 different varieties\" of the rest of the world\nshall we \"harmonize\"-- give up discovery, no cross-examination, no jury, no sanctity of\noath, political interference, conflict of interest, etc. etc.; and above all, acceptance that the\nstate is supreme over the individual.\nWhat good is the \"harmonized\" procurement of a patent when there is far from\n\"harmony,\" let alone real and effective opportunities, in enforcing the same in the rest of\nthe world?\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nHow shallow we are--discussing nonsense while not even addressing the real\nchallenges we should be working on if the dream of a modern world patent system is\nreally an ultimate goal.\nAre all technologies today suited to be fitted to the same type of patent\napplications and even patents? Should the patent system be belabored for \"everything\nunder the sun\"? When can enlightened interdisciplinary-evolved public policy\nconsiderations over-ride the legalistic strangle-hold on thinking? Have we outlived the\ndinosaur courts at least in technologically based disputes?\nDo large companies need the same rights today as start-up entrepreneurs? Are\nsmall entrepreneurs to be shackled with the same restrictions, tax and competition laws as\nlarge companies?\nThese are among the real questions of today in my opinion.\nWere the world, indeed, to emulate our system and our protections, and try to\n\"harmonize\" with our provenly better ideas and the more free and more productive life\nstemming therefrom [remembering that America is indeed a miniature version of the\nworld, and a highly successful model of all countries already working together in\n\"harmony\"], we might start the rest of the world on a useful, if not fruitful track.\nLastly, do our politicians clamoring for \"harmonization\" even know that while\nAmerica is Constitutionally a first inventor country, we long ago \"harmonized\" with any\nadministrative advantages that may reside in the first-to-file philosophy?\nIn our Patent Office, we have, since the time of the Constitution and today,\nalways treated the first-to-file as also the first (and real) inventor!\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\nThe thing that distinguishes us, however, from the other first-to-file countries, is\nthat our law treats this only as a presumption, rebuttable by the real inventor. Our law\nhas accordingly created the before-discussed interference safeguard process, not only to\npermit such rebutting in the interest of justice as appropriate, but also to safeguard against\nstealing and fraud, with which foreign first-to-file systems provide no assistance\nwhatsoever.\nWe are far ahead of the crude \"first-to-file\" systems of the rest of the world in our\nsophistication of a rebuttable presumption, which then allows us also to satisfy the\nmandate to Congress under Article I, Section 8, to secure the \"exclusive rights\" to the real\n\"inventor\" of the \"discovery.\"\nJim, the rest of the world is not even in our league!\nAs earlier shown, its thinking has produced and still produces results far inferior\nto ours.\nWe should not let \"losers\" (or to be generous, under-achievers) lead (nay,\nmislead) us for some illusory Pied Piper trade or other promises -- none of which is the\nslightest bit understandable to me.\nAnd a word to Congress.\nThere is a reason why the whole technological community trusts the Patent Office\nwith their most confidential secret invention disclosures long before they're known to the\npublic. We have developed at least one federal agency that is trusted and has proven\nthoroughly honest; and, to my knowledge, in over 55 years of practice, has never violated\nthe confidentiality undertaking for inventors disclosures, nor succumbed to the\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\ntemptation of bribes or special favors. Inventors trust the integrity of the engineers and\nscientists who examine their most commercial secrets under sworn fiduciary obligations.\nThere is sadly no such trust in politicians (perhaps the understatement of the\nmillennium!)\nAnd so far, no member of Congress has yet, to my knowledge, been so bold or so\nbrazen or foolhardy, or anxious to go to jail, as to stick his or her fingers into this\nfiduciary mechanism of the Patent Office.\nBut today and in the recent past, the politicians have been getting bolder in trying\nto swap patent system provisions for political and bargaining purposes. Though\narrogantly thinking they really understand--having in many instances been coached by\nlarge corporate lobbying lawyers, even including the likes of the Enrons -- they have\nseveral times come dangerously close to perhaps killing the goose that has been laying\nthe golden egg. Not that they want to, but because they do not appreciate the sensitive\nnuances of the framework of principles built up and honed by experience over two\ncenturies as above outlined.\nI must confess I do not see a Madison or a Pinckney or a Jefferson in their midst,\nor anyone even approaching the intellect, understanding and wisdom of the creative\nfounders of our patent system; but know-it-all politicians may grandiosely mistake who\nthey are, as they seem to mistake themselves for the President or Secretary of State or\nSecretary of Defense, and they may throw a monkey wrench into the very delicate\nmachinery that actually makes our patent system outperform the world.\nTo use patent provision give-aways for political purposes and trade-concession\nbargaining is in my mind as akin to treason (even if done stupidly) as one who\n\nAmerica's Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World\n\ndeliberately and/or carelessly blows up the mechanisms of our government and\nindustries.\nFor over 200 years we have developed a patent system that enables us to\noutperform the whole world put together. Why are there some in Congress who either\nhave such inferiority complexes or such a real ignorance of what actually makes Uncle\nSam tick, that they feel they must look to the second and third-best models abroad?\nJim, I have heard not a single sensible word from the would-be \"harmonizers\" as\nto any compelling reason why we should just now abandon our patent system birthright,\nor in what respect Europe's ideas have proven compellingly more desirable and more\nfruitful and have outperformed ours.\nThey have not sustained any burden of proof, even to a scintilla of evidence -- and\nI hope and trust, as an experienced trial lawyer, that you'll hold their feet to the fire.\nLet us know if we can be of further help.\n\nRobert H.

      "content": "Consequences of the Bayh-Dole Act\n\n6.901 Final Paper\n\nProfessor Robert Rhines\n\nDecember 12, 2005\n\nDavid Levenson\n\nLevenson 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 is arguably one of the most influential pieces of\nlegislation to impact the field of intellectual property law in the twentieth century. The\nBayh-Dole Act permits a university, small business, or non-profit institution using federal\nfunds for research to produce an invention to retain the title on any patent issued for such\ninventions. Prior to this act, the government retained ownership of all patents granted\nusing government money. The government also retained the right to license out the\ninventions to the private sector, which it did non-exclusively. This, however, was\ndetrimental to the growth of the U.S. because companies wanted to develop products it\nhad the exclusive rights to sell. Thus, universities were creating new and exciting\ntechnology using government funds that were never reaching the industry or the public.\nThe Bayh-Dole act changed the way these government funded patents were handled and\nthere was an explosion of university patenting following 1980. For a good while it\nseemed the Bayh-Dole Act produced only positive consequences for academia and the\nprivate sector. However, especially recently, there have been some issues raised about the\neffects of the act upon trends in research, conflicts of interest and the problems with\nbiomedical patents. The effects of the Bayh-Dole Act and the concerns raised about it are\nsignificant to intellectual property and it is an important task to review the act and\ndetermine its effectiveness.\n\nHistory of Federally Funded Patents Prior to 1980\n\nThe transfer of technology from research laboratories in American universities to\nthe U.S. commercial market place is a crucial part of the growth of the United States\ntechnologically and financially. The funding for the research carried out at the\nLevenson 2\n\nuniversities has come in a large part from the federal government. For the greater portion\nof the 20th century this process, known as technology transfer, was very slow and often\nstifled by government policy. The reason for the small amount of technology moving\nfrom universities to industry was due mostly to the fact that the United States government\nretained the rights to all inventions produced by universities using government funding.\nPrior to 1980, the federal government retained the licenses to all patents granted to\nuniversities using federal money to support their research. This slowed down the process\nof technology transfer because many government agencies were reluctant to relinquish\nownership of the patents to universities or industry. Instead these agencies granted non-\nexclusive licenses to anyone who wished to produce the inventions ([2] 1). The non-\nexclusive licenses were the major factor in suppressing the flow of technology. As a\nresult of the non-exclusive licenses companies were turned off to the idea of\nmanufacturing the inventions owned by the government. Companies resisted purchasing\nlicenses for government owned patents because their competitors could just as easily\nacquire the same license, and develop and sell the same product ([2] 2). There was no\nincentive for a company to purchase the licenses so they simply did not. In fact, prior to\n1980, only 5% of government owned patents had ever been used in industry ([4] 2). This\nwas an extraordinarily low number and it concerned the government beginning in the\n1970's ([3] 10).\n\nThe Bayh-Dole Act\n\nThere were many attempts to increase the flow of technology from universities\nprior to 1980, but none have been as successful or as important as the Bayh-Dole Act.\nThe act was enacted into law on December 12, 1980. Specifically the Bayh-Dole Act\nLevenson 3\n\nallows universities, small businesses and other non-profit organizations to elect to retain\nany \"subject invention\" made with federal funds. The institution retaining the title must\ncommit to the commercialization of that invention ([4] 6). The university is also required\nto share a portion of the royalties from the invention with the inventors and must use a\nportion of the royalties for laboratory purposes. The government does reserve certain\nrights to protect the public interest. It retains a \"nonexclusive, nontransferable,\nirrevocable, paid-up license to practice on behalf of the United States any subject\ninvention\" ([4] 5). The government also has the right to require the contractor who owns\neither the title or an exclusive license to the invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially\nexclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant ([4] 6). This\nright is reserved to protect the public from having universities withhold licenses for\npatents that could affect the safety of the public.\n\nBecause of the act, the universities can control the title for any inventions and\nhave the right to exclusively license out the invention to private industry. The Bayh-Dole\nAct works positively for all parties involved and creates incentives for research. The\nuniversity is able to retain the title to the patents and create revenue by licensing the\npatent or selling it entirely to a private company. The private sector is provided with the\nincentive to develop the inventions created because they can purchase the exclusive rights\nto produce the inventions from the university. Although the government loses the funds\nfrom the sale of the non-exclusive licenses, it gains revenue from the taxes levied on the\nsales of the products that the private sector sells because of the exclusive licenses\ncompanies can now purchase. Also, only 5% of government owned patents had been used\nLevenson 4\n\nin industry prior to 1980 so the government was not losing much from the sale of its\nlicenses after the passage of the act.\nPositive Effects of the Bayh-Dole Act\n\nFollowing the passage of the act, the number of patents granted to universities\nincreased exponentially. Figure 1 shows the percentage of all domestic patents granted\nassigned to United States research universities. It is clear that since Bayh-Dole the\nnumber of research related patents has dramatically increased. There was an increase in\nthe rate of patenting as far back as 1975 as indicated in Figure 1, but it is clear that there\nwas a turning point in 1980. There are arguments that the Bayh-Dole Act did not begin,\nbut merely helped along a period of change in the number of university patents ([3] 15).\nRegardless, it is clear that after the act was passed into law, universities gained a much\nlarger share of total patents granted.\n\nFigure 1: The Percentage of Patents Granted to Research Universities [3].\n\nBesides an increase in the sheer number of patents granted to research\nuniversities, several other cited stats show the positive impact of the act. For example, it\nLevenson 5\n\nhas been estimated that since 1980 there has been a ten-fold increase in the number of\nuniversities actively engaging in patenting their research ([2] 1). This statistic can help\nexplain the jump in Figure 1 around 1980 which was on top of what looks like an already\nsteadily increasing percentage of patents granted to universities. There were several\nresearch universities in the early 1970's who began to file for an increasing number of\npatents. In 1980, with the passage of the act, new universities saw the incentive to patent\nand began doing so. This explains the increase in the percentages in Figure 1 in the\n1970's and the subsequent increase following 1980.\nToday, about thirty billion dollars of economic activity per year and 250,000 jobs\ncan be attributed to technologies born in academic institutions. Also, over 2200 new\ncompanies have been formed since 1980 that were based on the licensing of an invention\nfrom an academic institution ([2] 2). These statistics all lead to the conclusion that the\nBayh-Dole Act has significantly contributed to the development of technology transfer in\nthe latter quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nIssues and Concerns\n\nGenerally, the Bayh-Dole Act is regarded as having a large positive impact on\nU.S. research and on the U.S. economy. It certainly has been influential in increasing the\nnumber of university-based patent applications and has aided the growth of the economy\nand the growth of technology. There are, however several issues that have been raised\ndue to the passing of this act which will be elaborated upon here.\nOne of the major incentives for universities is that they have the right to grant\nexclusive licenses for their patented invention or sell the title to the patent to private\nindustry. There have been concerns that because of this there will be conflicts of interest\nLevenson 6\n\ncreated between industry and the research universities. According to senior research\nscholar Mildred Cho of Stanford University states:\n\nThe Bayh-Dole Act has created opportunities for conflict of interest for\nuniversity faculty members because academic-industry partnerships can\noffer direct financial rewards to individual faculty members in the form of\nconsulting fees, royalties, and equity in companies while simultaneously\nfunding these faculty members' research. ([4] 16)\n\nMany researchers have consulted for and worked for the private sector which creates ties\nto certain companies. This may lead researchers to favor certain companies when\nlicensing out the patents, which would not promote fair competition. It may also lead to\nskewed research, which is another possibility that concerns critics of the act.\n\nUniversities have remained the main institutions where fundamental scientific\nresearch has taken place. With the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act there is much more\nincentive for universities to shy away from basic research which will produce less patents\nand applicable inventions, and move towards applied research to gain more royalties\nfrom patenting. Mildred Cho \"asserts that university research is 'skewed' toward\nmarketable products and not basic research\" ([4] 16). This issue seems like a viable\npossibility, but a study of 3,400 faculty at six major research institutions showed that the\nratio of applied research projects to basic science research has not changed over the\nperiod between 1983 to 1999 ([5]). According to the National Science Foundation from\n1980 to 2001 the percentage of basic science research actually increased from 66.6% to\n74.1% and applied researched decreased from 33.4% to 25.9% ([1] 42). While conflicts\nof interest and a skewing in choice of research may be reasonable concerns associated\nwith the Bayh-Dole Act, there has been insufficient proof of these issues creating actual\nnegative effects.\nLevenson 7\n\nThe criticism of the act with the most clout is the argument concerning\nbiomedical research that is funded by the government. The largest portion of federal\nfunding for academic research falls within the realm of medical and biological sciences\n([4] 20). Since the passage of the act, the support for biomedical research has increased\nfrom $4.296 million (in 1996 dollars) in 1980 to $13.652 million (in 1996 dollars) in\n1996 ([4] 20). This jump sparked some concern about the patenting of fundamental\nresearch ([4] 21). Patents are designed to foster innovation, but there is an argument that\nuniversities patenting biomedical discoveries made with federal dollars inhibit the\ncreation of final products, which are available to sell. Many of the discoveries made by\nuniversities in the biomedical field are the first steps in a process to create new drugs and\ntherapies ([4] 20). These university patents are called research tools. Research tools are\nnot final products and are not available to commercialize.\n\nBy allowing universities to retain the title to patents that are simply the beginning\nsteps of the process to a final product, the cost of the final product increases. Industry\nmust pay for the cost of the license to use the biomedical patent as well as its own R&D\ncosts to develop the rest of the process to create the final drug or therapy. In the end, it is\nthe consumer who ends up covering the cost of the original licensing fee ([4] 22). This is\na problem because this process goes against everything the patent system was created for.\nIt slows and may even stop innovation instead of promoting it. The private sector dealing\nwith biomedical products must go through the process of purchasing the license and may\neven decide that it is not financially sound to pursue the development of the university\npatent. Of course, it can also be argued that the first steps in the process would never\nhave been created if not for the Bayh-Dole Act promoting biomedical innovation, but\nLevenson 8\n\neither way the general public is left to cover the cost of the new drug or therapy or may\nbe left without it at all.\n\nThere have been few resolutions passed which protect against the concerns over\nthe Bayh-Dole Act. The negative consequences are quite serious and need to be\naddressed as so. Just because there is little evidence concerning the existence of conflicts\nof interest does not mean that it does not take place. It would be easy to disguise and\ngathering data would be difficult. Many university researchers do have ties to private\nindustry and may even own their own company ([2] 5). There must be more research\ndone into this to determine the effects of conflict of interest. While research skewing\nseems to have not been an issue thus far there could potentially be problems in the future\nif the economy takes a dive or universities lose funding for some reason. The biomedical\npatent problem is a very real one and needs to be addressed more clearly than it has,\nwhich will be discussed below.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn general the benefits created by the Bayh-Dole Act greatly outweigh any\npossible negative consequences. The act was built quite soundly to allow incentives for\nall involved parties (government, academia, industry), but also has safety measures to\nensure that the inventions are handled correctly. The act defines how the university must\nappropriate the funds created through royalties due to licensing fees and the government\nretains a special license to use when the invention is deemed critical to public interest.\nFinancial and technological growths are promoted well in academia and the public and\nprivate sectors. The results speak for themselves as well. The number of research\nLevenson 9\n\nuniversity related patents has increased enormously since the passage of the act, the\nnumber of businesses created around an idea involved with a university patent has\nincreased, the number of jobs involved with university patents has increased, and the\nAmerican economy has certainly benefited from these positive consequences of the\nBayh-Dole Act ([4] 20-22).\nUnfortunately, the act is not flawless. While there have been few adverse effects\nthat are directly linked to the act there is the possibility of certain issues becoming major\nproblems. Just because there has been little evidence of conflicts of interest between\nuniversity researchers and the private sector does not mean measures should not be taken\nto prevent this from happening. The same preventative measures should be taken to\nensure the appropriate balance between basic and applied research. The government\nshould require a committee to be created at any university electing to retain the rights to\nthe title of their patent. Many universities have hired professional technology managers to\nwork with the university and act as a liaison to the private sector ([4] 16). While this is a\ngood step, it is not enough. The committee should consist of more than just an outside\nprofessional hired by the university. The Technology Transfer committee needs to consist\nof faculty from every department that uses federal funding for their research as well as an\nexpert trained in the field. There needs to be a contact for the committee with the federal\ngovernment. The committee should be required to report to this contact at least once\nevery year.\nThe purpose of this committee will be to act as an interface between the\nuniversity, the government and industry. Having multiple members of the faculty as well\nas reporting to a government agency designed to handle technology transfer allows for a\nLevenson 10\n\nsystem of checks and balances to ensure that there will be no conflicts of interest present\nand that every company has a fair shot at acquiring the exclusive license to a patent.\nHaving a member from every department that utilizes federal funds while ensure that the\nresearch is not swayed away from basic research towards applied research as faculty that\ndoes not often patent will have a say in the committee. Also, reporting to the government\ncontact will allow data about university patenting and revenues due to licensing to be\neasily gathered and analyzed. Thus, it will be easy to locate trends in university patenting\nand technology transfer.\nTo alleviate the problems associated with biomedical patents there have already\nbeen steps taken by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office (USPTO). The NIH has created guidelines asserting that research\ntools (patents granted for processes that do not lead to commercialization) that are\ndeveloped with federal funds must be made available to other scientists under reasonable\nterms ([4] 18). The USPTO has also changed their guidelines to determine the\npatentability of biotechnology discoveries ([4] 18). While these are good steps to ensure\nthat licensing fees for biomedical patents are reasonable, they are not concrete. Congress\nneeds to step in and develop a plan that will protect the inventors of the research tool\nwhile still making it available to the private sector to develop into drugs and therapies.\nCongress could set a licensing fee for research tools deemed important to the public\nsector that the university must abide by. After all, financial rewards from patenting\ncomprised only 3% percent of total funding for university research in the 2000 fiscal year\n([4] 18). Thus, a smaller licensing fee for only certain research tools will not\nsignificantly impact the university. It is more important to keep the public health in mind\nLevenson 11\n\nwhen considering biomedical patents than funding for universities and their right to\nlicense out patents.\nThe Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 has played an important role in the field of\nintellectual property, and will continue to have significant consequences for years to\ncome. The country has benefited as a whole from the legislation. Universities are\npatenting much more and industry is producing advanced technology for the general\npublic. However, there are some foreseeable problems associated with the act.\nUniversities, industry and the government must be made aware of the possible negative\neffects of the act and take a proactive stance in preventing them from occurring.\n\nLevenson 12\n\nWorks Cited\n\n[1] Academic Research and Development Expenditures: Fiscal Year 2001.\n\n[2] Council on Governmental Relations. 1999.

      "content": "Brazil's Generic Drug Manufacturing Success and\nthe policies that permitted it\nOver 500,000 Brazilians are either HIV-positive or suffer from AIDS.\nNatalia Arzeno\nRebeca Diaz\nSandra Gonzalez\n6.901 Final Project - December 9, 2004\n\nBrazil's Economic Status\nBrazil is a country that has undergone many political and economic\ndifficulties. Because of this it has not been able to grow and develop economically\nas many other countries around the world. With time, new political powers that\nhave done considerable efforts to improve its economy have emerged. As of today,\nBrazil's economy prevails over that of all other South American countries.\nHowever, its foreign debt has not reduced enough as to see a considerable constant\neconomic growth reflected by the strengthening of exportation. This implies that\neven though the economic picture of Brazil has increased in the past years, it still\nhas a long way before it is considered a competent economic power at worldwide\nlevel.\nCurrently, Brazil's most significant economic source is in the industrial and\nmanufacturing sector. However, in the past few years, pharmaceuticals have\ncaused a positive impact on the economy. Brazil is the 11th largest pharmaceutical\nmarket in the world in sales and the 6th in volume. It has the leading role in South\nAmerica's pharmaceuticals and most large international pharmaceuticals, like\nNovartis, Roche and GSK have their main production and supply bases in South\nAmerica established in Brazil. More than 300 companies, including subsidiaries of\nmost major multinational laboratories and local pharmaceuticals, compose this\nindustry (UK Trade and Investment).\n\nThe need for a reform of the Patent Laws\nThe growth of this market is mainly due to a new Intellectual Property Law\nenacted in 1996. This law provided a 20-year patent for drugs, including\nprotection for those not yet on the market. This law was first enacted in order to\nreduce patent piracy in Brazil. In 1995, the U.S. industry's losses in Brazil due to\npatent piracy were $720 million. Because of this, the U.S. Trade Representative\nput Brazil under watch and threatened with commercial sanctions if nothing was\ndone about this. Brazil also realized that by granting pharmaceutical patents and\nreducing drug piracy, the cost of medicines would decrease, making indispensable\ndrugs affordable to poor citizens. Brazil also realized that granting patents for\ndrugs would be an incentive for scientists and companies to research in this area\nand improve not only the cost of living of the country by producing drugs locally,\nbut also the economy, unemployment, and public health of the country. This\nwould be due to the fact that with these incentives large international\npharmaceuticals would be interested in establishing plants in Brazil. These new\npatent laws in Brazil pleased most countries since this would attract more R&D in\nthe pharmaceutical field, which would help improve public health at a global level\n(USDOS).\n\nCurrent Pharmaceutical Market\nThe potential for pharmaceutical market is substantial. Currently only 30%\nof the population has access to medicine regularly, so the actual medicine profits\nare low. Health insurance does not cover medicines, but the government provides\ntreatment to special chronicle diseases, such as AIDS and diabetes. The\ngovernment is aware of this problem and is seeking for solutions that will allow\nmore access to a wide variety of medicines. Brazil is the leader in life-style drugs,\nsuch as vitamins (UK Trade and Investment).\nThe largest pharmaceutical market is that of generic drugs. Brazilian\ngovernment realized that in order to be able to provide better access to medicines,\nthey would need to recur to generic drugs. After this introduction, the prices of\ndrugs have decreased considerably and the market keeps increasing in such a way\nthat today it constitutes 5% of the market volume. However, recent studies show\nthat most drugs are still restricted to high-class population. The government\ncontinues to encourage generic drugs industries to reside in Brazil since they\nbelieve that with these drugs, eventually the low-income population will have easy\naccess to most drugs. In order to encourage drug companies in Brazil, the\ngovernment offered preferential purchase options and special financial investment\nconditions to pharmaceuticals that establish plants in the country.\nCurrently, manufacturing under a license is the best way to develop\nbusiness in patented or generic drugs in Brazil. They comprise a large\n\npharmaceutical industry with high quality manufacturing, sales and distribution\nthat is ready to include more products and world-known pharmaceuticals.\nHow has Brazil become a dominant figure in generic drug\nmanufacturing?\nThe success of Brazil's generic drug manufacturing originates from\nthe freedom of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) policies and also its\nlaissez-faire attitude concerning intellectual property rights of both\nBrazilian and international issues. The policies prior to 2003 allowed\ndeveloping countries to manufacture their own generic drugs if name-brand\ndrugs were too expensive. Many developing countries lacked the resources\nto manufacture generics, but Brazil's generic drug base had been growing\nsince the 70s.\nOne of the major generic drug manufacturers, Laboratoria Cristalia,\nwas started in 1972 by \"Dr. Ogari de Castro Pacheco to make cheaper\ndrugs for patients with mental illnesses at his private clinic next to the drug\nlab,\" (Bloomberg). The laboratory now employs 1.200 workers and\nmanufactures 150 drugs.\nBoth Brazilian companies and international companies have fueled\nBrazilian generic drug manufacturing. A joint venture between Teva of\nIsrael and Laboratorios Biosintetica formed in November 2000 (Rich, Para.\n5) to take advantage of the infant generic market in Brazil. The new\n\ncompany, BioTeva planned to introduce a total of 50 generic products into\nthe market by the end of 2001.\nWhat was the role of the WTO?\nAfrica was facing a health crisis from AIDS and appealed to the\nWTO to allow the sale of generic pharmaceuticals to developing countries.\nAfrica wanted to buy generic AIDS drugs from countries like India and\nBrazil who had an established generic drug-manufacturing base. The WTO\nis composed of 146 member countries and entered into a deliberation\nprocess among all the countries to determine the viability of allowing\nBrazilian made generics to be sold in Africa. The deliberations took over\neight months to come to a consensus. The United States had been trying to\nprotect the interests of drug companies because it thought pharmaceutical\ncompanies would lose control of their patents. The final breakthrough\noccurred when African country representatives pleaded to the WTO that\n\"nearly 2.2 million Africans have died from AIDS and other killer diseases\nsince the issue became deadlocked on Dec. 16 [2002],\" (Cheap drugs, Para.\n3). Brazilians benefited from the cheaper generics because Brazil had the\ncapacity to produce them. Africans died because their country lacked the\ncapacity to produce generics. Members of the WTO finally realized the\n\ngravity of the situation and allowed developing countries to purchase\ngenerics from Brazil and India.\nWhen selling generic drugs to a developing country, the WTO must\nbe notified and the drug maker must obtain an export license from its\ngovernment (Bloomberg, Para. 12).\nHow the Brazilian government negotiated with pharmaceutical\ncompanies\nShortly before the August 2003 decision to allow Brazil to export\ngenerics to countries like Africa, Brazil set a deadline with Merck, Pfizer,\nand other companies to reduce the cost of AIDS drugs (Bloomberg, Para.\n1). The Brazilian drug market, especially AIDS drugs, is important to\nthese drug companies because Brazil ranked sixth in medicine consumption\nin 2000 (Rich, Para. 10). Brazil presented an unprecedented and unique\ncase because its capacity to produce generic drugs surpassed any other\ncountries ability. In addition to the Brazilians' ability to produce generics,\ntheir intellectual property policy contained a 1997 law that voided patents\nif companies employed price abuse (Clendenning, Para. 3). The\npharmaceutical companies faced losing significant profits in the Brazilian\nmarket and jeopardizing their patents or reduce the AIDS drugs price.\nBrazil took its first steps in breaking AIDS drugs patents in early\nSeptember 2003. Brazil requested reductions of up to 50 percent on three\n\ndifferent AIDS drugs. Brazilian officials claimed to have reverse-\nengineered the three drugs involved in the negotiations, and they would not\nbe able to produce the drugs in sufficient quantities quickly enough\n(Miriam, Para. 12). Brazil finally negotiated the prices of the AIDS drugs\nto a satisfactory price, and won a huge battle against the pharmaceutical\ncompanies.\nDespite winning a drastic reduction in AIDS drugs pricing, Brazil\nchose to begin manufacturing generics of the medication due to rising\ncosts. Brazil's announcement in late November 2004 brought more\nattention to an already famous program. Brazil gives out the medication\nfree of charge to patients, and the demand continued to increase. The long-\nterm viability the anti-AIDS program was in danger, and this time,\npharmaceutical price reduction could not solve the problem. Brazil's head\nof AIDS Programme, Pedro Chequer said it was the only way Brazil could\nafford to keep up its anti-AIDS strategy. Brazil requested voluntary\nlicensing from the pharmaceutical companies, but was prepared to break\nthe patents using compulsory licensing (Osava, Para. 21). Merck\nannounced in December that it would allow Brazil to make one of its AIDS\ndrugs because a further reduction in price would result in an unprofitable\ndrug for Merck.\nBrazil has managed to fuel a vibrant generic drug manufacturing\nindustry and also attract cutting-edge biomedical industry based on\n\nunstable property rights. Ireland and Singapore offer appealing tax\nstructures, but have failed to produce innovative pharmaceutical sectors.\nInnovative products are not typically developed in countries without\nreliable property rights (O'Grady, Para. 25). Brazil is an exception but\ncontinues to be pressured by the United States to tighten its property rights\nto protect U.S. pharmaceutical companies. Brazil claims that tightening\nproperty rights will result in an erosion of the anti-AIDS programs it has\nfought so hard to maintain.\nIn short, Brazil's ability to negotiate the prices of AIDS drugs\nrepresents a market failure, namely in terms of intellectual property rights.\nBrazil can only hold on to its poor-country status for so long. Its spending\nhas increased and its poor government and educational infrastructure\nlargely contribute to its poverty. Brazil cannot continue to claim a health\ncrisis in order to void other country's patents and produce generics. It also\ncannot continue the practice of voiding a country's patent based on price\ngouging. Brazil decides what is price gouging and of course it will be\nsubjective.\nBrazil needs to overhaul its educational infrastructure and\nproperty rights to reflect the views of respected countries.\n\nBrazil's Generic Drug Manufacturing Success and the policies\nthat permitted it\nBrazil's capability of producing generic drugs has caused many disputes\nbetween Brazil and the United States patent holders, where the production and\ndistribution of generic drugs for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune\ndeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has been leading the controversies for the past\nfew years. In order to justify breaking the patents for some of the drugs needed in\ntheir AIDS drug cocktails, Brazil declared AIDS a national emergency. Brazil has\nthe largest number of people infected with HIV in Latin America and the\nCaribbean. In some regions, this disease means losing basic rights, both in health\ncare and society, and facing a discriminating and stigmatizing community. In a\nlarger scale, without the proper medical treatment, AIDS would prevent hundreds\nof thousands of people from being able to provide for their families, as well as\neliminate generations of food producers in some countries, increasing the number\nof people living in hunger. By having the state provide antiretroviral treatment,\nBrazil managed to reduce the number of deaths caused by AIDS by more than\n50% since 1996. In this time period it has also reduced the number of people that\nneed to be hospitalized because of the disease by 80%. The large scale in which\nthese antiretroviral treatments have been implemented has only been possible\nbecause of the large reduction in the price of the AIDS drugs. These drugs do not\ncure the fatal disease, but it allows those infected to live a longer life and gives\n\nthem the strength to be able to provide for their families in a way where the\ndisease is not as recognizable and thus the negative societal impact is also\ndiminished. Though much of the reduction in price was achieved by having the\nBrazilian government negotiate with the companies that produce the patented\ndrug, a considerable reduction in the price can be attributed to the production of\nthe generic equivalent of the drugs with the highest prices.\nBrazil's Patent Laws\nThis mass production of AIDS drugs in Brazil has only been possible\nbecause of Brazil's patent laws and the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Trade\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPS) as well as the Doha\nDeclaration, which reaffirmed the purpose of TRIPS. The easiest way for Brazil to\nproduce generic drugs would be by following Article 68 of their 1997 patent law,\nwhich requires a foreign company to begin production of the patented product in\nBrazil within three years of obtaining the patent. The US has filed complaints\nagainst this law, suggesting it is discriminating against imported products, yet\nBrazil holds that Article 68 is only enforced when the drug companies abuse the\neconomic power associated with holding the patent. In this manner, if the\ncompanies that hold the patents for expensive AIDS drugs do not begin production\nin Brazil within the specified time period, they hold no legal right to prohibit the\ngeneric production of the drug. The ideal solution to this problem would have the\nBrazilian government and the pharmaceutical companies agree on a price for the\n\ndrug in question. Though this solution has ended Brazil's threats to produce the\ngeneric version of certain drugs, the lack of a 100% success rate has been the\ncause of the controversy.\nTRIPS and the Doha Declaration\nWhen companies that hold the drugs patents and the Brazilian government\ncannot agree on setting a price for the drug, the government has often resourced to\nthe rights involved with TRIPS and the Doha Declaration. TRIPS protects the\ncompanies that develop and patent the drugs by granting them twenty years of\nexclusivity in producing the drug. With this protection, for a country to begin\nproducing generic drugs before the twenty-year term is over, it must obtain\nconsent from the company. However, TRIPS also provides countries to bypass this\npatent in certain ways such as compulsory licensing and exclusions on patent\nadmissibility for some products, subject to the payment of royalties. Compulsory\nlicensing does not require the country to obtain the patent holder's permission\nbefore beginning to produce the equivalent generic drug, and can only be carried\nout when facing a national emergency. Brazil declared the AIDS outbreak and\nepidemic to be such an emergency and was able to take advantage of TRIPS for\nreducing the price of the AIDS drugs. In June 2001, in a TRIPS Council meeting,\nthe contents of the agreement were discussed since some African countries felt\n\nthat the full patent protection should not apply to countries that can afford the\ndrugs in cases of national health emergencies. They felt that the duration of the\npatent protection and the degree to which the patent could not be infringed should\nbe revised for low-income countries, but this change would not apply to countries\nthat are economically capable of obtaining the patented drug. From this discussion\nthe Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (the Doha\nDeclaration) was developed in November 2001. The Doha Declaration reaffirms\nthe rights of the countries suffering health emergencies and reestablishes the\npurpose of TRIPS as that of public health interest. Many countries including the\nUnited States agreed this declaration on.\nArticle 5 of the Doha Declaration describes the relationship between\ncountries regarding the patented products. Article 5a establishes that each\nprovision of TRIPS has to be interpreted individually, taking into consideration the\noverall objective. Article 5b provides the countries with the rights of granting\ncompulsory licenses and establishing the rules for granting them. Article 5c allows\nthe countries to decide what can be considered a national emergency, in which\ncase a government can issue a compulsory license without having contacted the\npatent holder. Article 5d states that TRIPS does not allow patent protection for\nsecondary sales of the product, and each country decides to what extent the patent\nwill be valid after the initial sale of the product. In this manner, each country\ndecides if it will allow parallel imports such that the products can possibly be\nbought outside the country borders for a cheaper price and reintroduced into the\n\ncountry for redistribution. Since the member countries agreed the scale of the HIV\ninfection in Brazil was a national health emergency, in compliance with Article 5b\nof the Doha Declaration, Brazil is able to use compulsory licensing when\nnecessary for its AIDS drugs.\nAIDS drugs accessible for all\nIn 2001, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights voted almost\nunanimously in favor of making accessibility to AIDS drugs a human right. The\nonly opposing vote was that of the United States. The reasons for this action\nwould have to be further studied to find the justification. This act could possibly\nbe attributed to AIDS not being as major an issue in the US, or because most of\nthe companies that hold patents for AIDS drugs, which would be the ones affected\nby this act, are US pharmaceutical companies. However, the US government and\nthe pharmaceutical companies are two different entities, and though they might be\nin agreement with not allowing AIDS drugs to be a human right, the US\ngovernment is not against the Doha Declaration. When faced with the possibility\nof an anthrax epidemic, the US threatened to use compulsory licensing to obtain a\nlower price for the antibiotic that could cure this disease. Though the action was\nnot carried through, the intention of making use of Article 5b of the Doha\nDeclaration shows the government recognizes any country can suffer a national\nhealth emergency and ways to avoid patents in this situation are necessary. In this\n\nmanner, possible solutions to the problem between Brazil and the pharmaceutical\ncompanies cannot regard a change in the Doha Declaration or a direct intervention\nbetween the US government and Brazil's use of compulsory licensing. Since all\nother members of the UNCHR recognize AIDS drugs should be a human right, the\nextent of the AIDS infections in Brazil provide a real and solvable problem, so a\nfiner definition of a 'national health emergency' would not be able to solve the\npatent conflict. Thus a solution must be devised in some other way.\nUnited States' position on the Doha Declaration\nUnited States pharmaceutical companies, the major provider of foreign\ndrugs in Brazil, are not in agreement with the Doha Declaration since they lose\nprofit whenever compulsory licensing occurs. Their major argument up to date is\nthat by allowing compulsory licensing, which will mostly take place in developing\ncountries; the pharmaceutical companies will not be motivated to continue their\nresearch and development of drugs that would mostly be used in these countries.\nHowever, large pharmaceutical companies have admitted both that they spend\nmore than twice as much on marketing than on research and development, and that\nthey could sell AIDS drugs for a 90% discount and still make a profit. By taking\nthese facts into consideration, possible solutions for the compulsory licensing\nissue can be established. The problem being that pharmaceutical companies do not\nwant to waste their resources on drugs that will bring a smaller, but existing,\n\nprofit, a possible solution would be to require large enough companies to produce\na certain amount of drugs that will help control diseases in developing countries,\nwhere 'large enough' would be determined by their resources, facilities, and\nannual profit. Since the governments would most likely buy these drugs, no money\nhas to be spent on big advertising campaigns. To ensure continuous research, a\npercentage of the research and development budget would have to be dedicated to\ndrugs for major diseases in developing countries even if the disease is not common\nin the US. By describing everything in percentages, the amount of money and such\nwill be determined by the magnitude of the company. Other countries with major\npharmaceutical companies should also adopt this regulation.\nCompulsory Licensing and AIDS drugs\nPharmaceutical companies that hold the patents to the AIDS drugs in a\ncertain country have been further affected by compulsory licensing since 2003. In\na WTO meeting, compulsory licensing was extended to permit countries to import\ngeneric drugs from other countries in the case of a national health emergency\nwithout having to consult the rightful patent owner. However, this importation of\ngeneric drugs can only be carried out if the country itself is not capable of\nproducing the generic drugs. Brazil benefited from this addition to the compulsory\nlicensing definition since it began importing generic drugs from countries that do\nnot yet have to comply with the international patent. Even though Brazil has a\n\ndeveloped pharmaceutical industry and they are capable of producing the generic\ndrugs, they benefit from compulsory licensing since they cannot produce the AIDS\ndrugs quickly enough to account for the importing costs of the patented drugs for\nthe antiretroviral drug program. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies should be\nmore motivated to reach agreements on the price of the AIDS drugs, since it is\nnow easier for the country to receive the drugs from elsewhere. Otherwise, the\ncompanies should allow for the production in Brazil such as the agreement with\nMerck for the Efavirenz and Indinavir drugs, since the company will still receive\nroyalties. Regarding importation from other countries, there could be an\namendment to the international patent laws such that the patent is enforced in all\ncountries at the same time. In this case, the first international patent that is\nrecognized would provide the date of effectiveness of the international patents in\nthe other countries. However, this would involve a certain alliance between all\ncountries that might not be feasible.\nSolutions to Brazil's AIDS drug problem\nA possible solution to the Brazil AIDS drug problem can be an agreement\nsimilar to the one in 2002 between Brazil and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in\nSouth Africa. The agreement is such that MSF purchases AIDS drugs from\nFarManguinhos, a Brazilian pharmaceutical company, and this money has to go\ndirectly into research and development for AIDS drugs and drugs for other\n\nneglected diseases. By buying from the Brazilian company, MSF pays only half of\nwhat it would have paid if bought the US patented drugs. This program could also\nbe implemented between the US, Switzerland, and any other country with\npharmaceutical companies that provide AIDS drugs to Brazil, such that Brazil will\naccept a higher price than desired in the negotiations with the pharmaceutical\ncompanies, but the payment has to go directly into the research and development\nfor drugs that cure or control diseases in developing countries. The agreement\nwould have to be drawn out such that the whole payment, not just the net profits,\nwould go into research. This way, the morals of the countries are not compromised\nand both countries would be helping in the advance of solutions for less studied\ndiseases.\nIf pharmaceutical companies do not want countries such as Brazil to use\ncompulsory licensing as an option for AIDS drugs, then an agreement must be\nreached between the government and the pharmaceutical company. However,\nother measures can be taken such that the pharmaceutical company that had its\npatent waived can profit more from the production of the generic drugs. First of\nall, parallel importing should affect the result of the agreement. If parallel\nimporting is allowed in the country and the country can benefit from it, the price\nthe pharmaceutical company proposes should decrease, especially since access to\nthese drugs is now a human right. Also, the conditions by which parallel importing\nand cross-border trading are allowed should be defined more clearly and a tax or\nsome other measure could be established such that it does not affect the\n\npharmaceutical companies as much, but the people obtaining the drugs can get the\nlower price for the drug. However, this tax measure does not influence Brazil\nsince the antiretroviral treatment is provided free of charge.\nThe most effective yet feasible solution to Brazil's problem would then be\nthe one previously mentioned relating the relationship between Brazil and MSF. If\na price agreement cannot be reached, and the pharmaceutical company has made it\nclear they do not wish Brazil take compulsory licensing as a course of action, then\na lower price can be established such that Brazil buys the drug and the capital goes\ninto research and development for drugs that treat diseases that mainly affect\ndeveloping countries. Brazil has been recognized as having an effective fight\nagainst AIDS, and other countries strive to be the same way. Sub-Saharan\ncountries can base most of their help from the US since the US provides special\nhelp to those countries. However, as long as the government can keep providing,\nat least to an acceptable degree, and the pharmaceutical companies are still making\nprofit and keep researching AIDS, an agreement can be reached and the country\nwill not have to use compulsory licensing.\n\nReferences\n\"Progress in the Pharmaceutical Industry.\" US Department of State. 2004.\n<http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/intelprp/industry.htm>\n\"Case Study: Brazil's Pharmaceutical Industry. \" Introduction to Intellectual\nProperty Rights.

      "content": "Death of a Cracker\nThe Failure of the DMCA and How Digital Copyright Can Be Saved\nBy Brian Keegan\nImagine operating a business that required you to access a bank vault every night after\nthe bank was closed. Because your business is valuable to the bank, you establish a\ncontract with the bank's owner so that you would possess a key to access the vault as you\nneeded. Your intent is not to steal or otherwise undermine the security of the other\npatron's property, but rather, to be able to efficiently access your property during non-\nbusiness hours. However, the bank changes hands and the new management institutes a\nstrict policy of vault-access only during business hours. This is upsetting to your routine\nand business model, but you continue your nightly routine because you still possess the\nkey and a valid contract to the vault. One night, despite your benign intentions and\ndemonstrably legal right to be there, you are apprehended and accused of breaking-and-\nentering the bank.\nThis situation is analogous to the problems raised by a recent amendment to United States\ncopyright law. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) criminalizes technology\ncapable of circumventing copyright protections and increases penalties for copyright\ninfringement on the Internet. In the bank analogy, the contract and key represents decades\nof legal precedent on the right to fair use of copyrighted material protected like the bank\nvault. The DMCA is the new owner whose policy criminalizes the step of accessing the\nproperty even if it previously was within your right to do so. Legal and economically\nbeneficial fair use activities like reverse engineering, decryption, or emulating are now\nbeing stifled by the threat of severe criminal charges or expensive civil litigation under\nthe DMCA. Concurrently, the growing scope and length of copyright protections\ncombined with the restrictive anti-circumventive measures of the DMCA have the\npotential to completely eliminate the original intent of copyrights \"to promote the\nProgress of Science and useful Art\" for \"limited times.\"\n\nFair use has been a component of British common law since the early 18th century. The\ncore of \"fair use\" is the ability to use copyrighted material without permission or a\nlicense under certain conditions. Fair use is specifically codified in the United States\nunder the sweeping Copyright Act of 1976 as \"reproductions... for purposes such as\ncriticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom\nuse), scholarship, or research.\"1 Using copyrighted materials for the aforementioned\npurposes cannot be construed as infringement because the social, political, and economic\nimportance of these activities. It would be inefficient and deleterious to the founding\nConstitutional intent of copyright \"to promote progress\" if every teacher, researcher, or\nreporter had to submit to the process of obtaining a license. However, these exemptions\ncannot be structured so broadly as to render copyright ineffective. A four-step test\ndeveloped in a 1841 federal court (Folsom v. Marsh, 9 F.Cas. 342) case was incorporated\ninto the 1976 legislation2 that considered the potential commercial purpose of the fair use\nclaims relative to the nature, amount, and effect of the copied work.\nThe DMCA represents the United States' obligation under the World Intellectual\nProperty Organization (WIPO) and Berne Convention to legislatively implement the\nWIPO Copyright Treaty. The act has several provisions, but the most important changes\nconcern the criminalization of technology that can circumvent the protective measures\nplaced on copyrighted materials. Section 1201 of the revised statue added by the DMCA\nnow states, \"No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls\n1 Title 17. Chapter 1. § 107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use.\n2 Ibid: In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use\nthe factors to be considered shall include--\n1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a\ncommercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n2. the nature of the copyrighted work;\n3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted\nwork as a whole; and\n4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted\nwork.\nThe fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding\nis made upon consideration of all the above factors\n\naccess to a work protected under this title.\"3 DMCA defines circumvention as to\n\"descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid,\nbypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of\nthe copyright owner.\" The DMCA was intended to criminalize the act of breaking the\nanti-piracy protections built into copyrighted materials like CDs and DVDs. However,\nthe manner in which it is written criminalizes any act of circumvention, even those which\nare necessary to use copyrighted materials under fair use.\nThis is a significant development for both copyright holders and members of society who\nrely upon fair use to conduct their business. The fundamental disparity between the intent\nof the legislation and the manner in which it is implemented gives copyright holders\nbroad legal powers to control who and how their copyrighted works can be accessed.\nMoreover, anyone who uses electronically protected copyrighted work without a license,\neven if they are acting under fair use, can be subject to criminal or civil charges under the\nDMCA. The pervasiveness of electronic media and the ease with which it can be copied\nhas resulted in many of them being protected by anti-piracy protections. Using these\nprotected materials without a license can now be classified as circumventive under the\nDMCA. This is akin being arrested for entering the vault in the bank example above. The\nrights previously granted to you have not changed, but the actions necessary to use them\nhave been criminalized. Copyright holders can now limit access to their copyrights, not\non the grounds of infringement4, but under the anti-circumvention protections of the\nDMCA.\nCase Studies\nThe DMCA's overly broad conception of circumvention has allowed companies to\npursue legal action against individuals and companies well beyond the original anti-\npiracy scope of the protections. Companies engage in lawsuits using the anti-\ncircumvention protections of the DMCA to stifle competition which, in turn, chills\n3 Title 17, Chapter 12. § 1201(a)(1)(A). Circumvention of copyright protection systems.\n4 The DMCA does not modify any part of Section 107 concerning Fair Use.\n\ninnovation. Because anti-piracy and copyright protection systems obviously affect\nelectronic media the most, the DMCA affects digital media and software users the most.\nMany computer users choose to modify existing software they own for their own\npersonal uses. In breaking the encryption protecting the copyrighted material, reverse\nengineering the software, or emulating its behavior, these users \"circumvent\" the\nmethods used to control access to the copyrighted material. However, while their intent is\nnot infringement, their fair use claims are undermined by the mere fact that their\ncircumventive step was illegal under the DMCA. Let us briefly explore four cases in\nwhich the individuals and companies have been accused of circumvention far beyond the\nscope of what was intended when the DMCA was passed.\nDmitri Sklyarov and AEBRP\nLet us review a case of a well-respected programmer who was detained by the US\ngovernment and falsely accused of violating the DMCA. Dmitry Sklyarov is a Russian\nprogrammer who developed a program that could convert Adobe electronic books\n(eBooks) into the less restrictive Portable Document Format (pdf). After giving a 2001\nconference presentation on his program, he was arrested by the FBI and charged with\ndistributing a product designed to circumvent copyright protection measures5. His\nAdvanced eBook Processor (AEBPR), impinged on no copyright of Adobe's software.\nHowever, because it \"circumvented\" Adobe's restrictions, it had the potential to allow\npirates to access protected documents, but it also allowed legitimate owners and licensees\nto use the documents in a more accepted format. Even though Sklyarov committed no act\nof circumvention in the United States and Russia does not abide by the DMCA, he was\ndetained for five months in the US, including several weeks in jail, because his Russian\nemployer, ElcomSoft, had distributed his software. He was allowed to return home and a\njury later acquitted Elcomsoft of all charges of circumvention6. On the surface, this\nappears to be a legitimate use of the DMCA as the AEBPR fell in a grey area. However,\nthe DMCA facilitated the extreme action of arresting and detaining a foreign national, a\n5 \"Dmitry Sklyarov.\" Wikipedia. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sklyarov>\n6 \"Dmitry Sklarov Arrested.\" Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n<http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/?f=unintended_consequences.html>\n\npunishment usually reserved for the most serious international criminals not an\ninnovative software programmer.\nMod-chips\nIn another David and Goliath battle, Sony used the DMCA to pursue legal action against\ndistributors of \"mod chips\" for its PlayStation video gaming system. Sony has a copy-\nprotection regime that prevents video game software purchased in one region of the\nworld from being used on PlayStation systems bought in a different region. A thriving\nmarket of \"mod chips\" eliminates these restrictions and allows players to use all their\nsoftware, regardless of where it is purchased. Like the AEBPR, these chips have the\npotential to be used for software piracy, but they have legitimate purpose for a user with\ndifferent region discs. Sony sued a distributor of these \"mod chips\" and won an\ninjunction against them under the DMCA despite the fact that the distributor did not\ninfringe Sony's copyright7. Their crime was circumvention, misnomer that has facilitated\na gross abuse of copyright protections to shore up the fortunes of a multi-billion dollar\nmedia conglomerates at the expense of end users' choice and control over their property.\nLexmark\nThe next case involves Lexmark, a printer manufacturer who used the DMCA to obtain\nan injunction against Static Control Components, a manufacturer whose Smartek chips\nare used by aftermarket toner manufacturers. Lexmark printers and their toner cartridges\ncan authenticate each other to provide additional features, an element that less-expensive\nafter-market toner companies cannot provide. SCC reverse engineered the hardware that\nenables the authentication to allow the aftermarket cartridges to interoperate with the\nLexmark printers. Lexmark brought suit under the DMCA, again not claiming copyright\ninfringement, but circumvention of its \"Toner Loading Program and Printer Engine\n7 \"Sony Attacks Playstation Mod Chips.\" Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n<http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/?f=unintended_consequences.html>\n\nProgram.\"8 Lexmark clearly has an economic motivation to secure a market for the\nreplacement cartridges it sells and intended to use the DMCA to eliminate competitors.\nThe 9th Circuit found that copyright does not protect such monopolistic behavior in an\nearlier case9. The 6th Circuit remanded the Lexmark case and the Supreme Court rejected\nLexmark's petition for certiorari, because \"Lexmark failed to establish a likelihood of\nsuccess on any of its claims, whether under the general copyright statute or under the\nDMCA\"10 Clearly, securing the market for printer toner cartridges was not the original\nintent of Congress when passing the DMCA.\nBnetd\nThe final case pits a large computer game maker, Blizzard Software, against its\ncustomers who developed an emulator of its online gaming service. The multiplayer\ngaming feature in many of Blizzard's software titles require that players use its gratis\nproprietary battle.net online gaming service. A small group of players disappointed with\nthe scope and stability of this service modified existing open-source software and reverse\nengineered the battle.net software to produce bnetd which allows users to operate their\nown servers. However, bnetd did not incorporate Blizzard's copy protection schemes\nwhich would prevent pirated copies from being played online. Blizzard filed suit and\nreceived an injunction against bnetd under the anti-circumvention clauses of the DMCA.\nJust as in the Lexmark case, bnetd provides a legitimate alternative to the current service.\nHowever the 8th Circuit granted Blizzard summary judgment on the grounds that the\n\"bnetd.org emulator enabled users of Blizzard games to access Battle.net mode features\nwithout a valid [authentication]. As a result, unauthorized copies of the Blizzard games\n8 McCullagh, Declan. \"Lexmark invokes DMCA in toner suit.\" C|net news.\n<http://news.com.com/2100-1023-979791.html>\n9 Sony v. Connectix (9th Circuit, February 2000). In a case between Sony and a software\ndeveloper who reverse engineered the Sony PlayStation to allow its software to emulate,\nor mimic, the Sony PlayStation, the Court found that Conntectix's use of Sony code was\nprotected as fair use. Moreover, the Court recognized that while \"Sony understandably\nseeks control over the market for devices that play games Sony produces or licenses. The\ncopyright law, however, does not confer such a monopoly.\"\n10 Lexmark v. Static Control (6th Circuit, October 2004)\n\nwere freely played on bnetd.org servers.\"11 This decision suggests that authentication and\nauthorization of activities takes precedence over enabling innovation and the ability to\nfreely use one's property.\nTrends\nOne can imagine how a typewriter can facilitate copyright infringement even though it\ndoes not circumvent copy-protection technology. Not only are typewriters permissible to\nown, it is preposterous to suggest that they should be regulated or controlled because of\ntheir capability to infringe copyright. Yet in other fields of technology, the threat of\nDMCA litigation is dampening innovation because individuals and businesses who had\nlegitimately modified software for their personal use are now criminals under this\nperverse statue. While these modifications in the previous examples had the potential to\nbe used for piracy, they did not infringe the copyrights of big corporations like Adobe\nand Sony. These new forms of useful software and hardware were produced by reverse\nengineering intentionally rudimentary of copy protection schemes. If media companies\ntruly wanted complete control over their copyrights, it would demand a system so\ninflexible and complex so as to dissuade any rational consumer from purchasing their\nproducts. It is this essential concept of legitimate end-user freedom that has been lost on\nthe media companies and even the courts.\nThe current trend under the DMCA would protect copyrights even after their protection\nhad expired. If we can imagine The DaVinci Code passing into the public realm in the\ndistant future (2076 if Dan Brown died tomorrow), the inevitable pervasiveness of\nelectronic media and the copy protection systems on this book at that time would prevent\nanyone from ever being able to \"freely\" access the book. In effect, the DMCA ensures\nthat copyrights can be \"locked up\" eternally if the owner can package the protected\ncontent with a system that \"can control access.\" Professor Lawrence Lessig alluded to\nthis fundamental dichotomy speaking to the Sklyarov case, \"Using software code to\n11 Davidson & Associates (Blizzard Entertainment) v. Jung. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n1 September 2005.\n\nenforce law is controversial enough. Making it a crime to crack that technology, whether\nor not the use of that ability would be a copyright violation, is to delegate lawmaking to\ncode writers.\"12\nWhile fair use and digital rights management schemas occupy a gray area in legal\nunderstanding worthy of clarification, such examinations are generally prevented by\nvirtue of the threat of expensive litigation that leads defendants to settle rather than air\nthese concerns before a court of law. There exists a distinct possibility for the act of\ncircumventing to pre-empt any intention that might would be considered non-infringing\nor fair use. In other words, the DMCA threatens to kill fair use if it becomes illegal to\nmodify content that is no longer protected by copyright simple because it possesses anti-\npiracy features. In many such areas, the prospect of facing severe criminal and civil\npenalties against well-funded corporate interests has become a sufficient deterrent for\nmany programmers and researchers to cease their \"circumventive\" activity.\nProposal\nWhile the DMCA does recognize a limited number of legitimate uses in §1201(d) and (f),\ntheses are constructed so narrowly relative to both the legal understanding of fair use and\nthe sweeping criminalization of circumvention as to be moot. When considered in the\ncontext that the copyright system lacks any formal registration system even though\ncopyright terms are increasing to as much as 70 years after the death of the author, the\nDMCA is another burden for innovators and entrepreneurs trying to stake a claim in a\nsaturated market of intellectual property.\nCongressmen Rick Boucher (Virginia's 9th Congressional District) introduced the Digital\nMedia Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA) to restore \"the historical balance in copyright\nlaw and ensuring the proper labeling of 'copy-protected compact discs.'\"13 Boucher\nrecommends that \"the only conduct that should be declared criminal is circumvention for\n12 Lessig, Lawrence. \"Jail Time in the Digital Age.\" Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n<http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/US_v_Elcomsoft/20010730_lessig_oped.html>\n13 DMCRA. Wikipedia. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCRA>\n\nthe purpose of infringing a copyright.\"14 This broadly-defined legislation alters the\nconstruction of what forms of circumvention are illegal, but it probably would not stem\nthe chilling tide of cease and desist letters by companies who are misconstruing the\nexisting legistation.\nProfessor Pamela Samuelson has a more narrow view that the exemptions within the\nDMCA should be expanded. This approach would specifically enumerate the activities\nand behavior allowed under fair use would remove much of the impetus for case-by-case\nlawsuits to be decided by courts. However, specific exemptions would need to be\ncontinually updated to reflect the evolution of technological systems which would in turn\nopen them up to modifications by concentrated corporate interests.\nA superior solution involves revising the DMCA and building up specific protections for\ncopyright holders to pursue action against infringers. Circumvention is not a sufficiently\ndefinable concept in the complex world of software, networks, and electronics that\ncopyright law now occupies. I propose a registry of copy-protection schemes\nenumerating and describing the works protected. In this way, plaintiffs are held to a\nhigher standard for defining circumvention. Moreover, the amendment provides for\nBoucher's conception of \"intent to infringe\" rather than \"capacity to infringe.\" The latter\nis the current standard under the DMCA as I developed in the arguments of the case\nstudies above. While a large-scale reform of the copyright system is necessary to fully\nattend to the challenges of copyright in the \"digital millennium,\" a more limited reform\naddressing copyright holders' concerns and protecting legitimate fair uses is proposed\nbelow.\n14 Cnet article\n\nAmendment to Title 17 Chapter 12 of U.S. Code on Circumvention of Copyright\nProtection and Management Systems\nAmended §1201: Circumvention of Copy Protection schemes\n(a) Violations Regarding Circumvention of Technological Measures.\n(1) It shall be unlawful to circumvent a duly registered copy-protection system\ncontrolling access to a work protected under this title with the intent to infringe\nupon the exclusive rights of works of authorship described in Chapter 1 of this\nTitle\n(2) No person shall manufacture, import, market, distribute, provide, or otherwise\ntraffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof,\nthat is designed or produced with the sole intent and purpose of circumventing a\ntechnology described under this title\n(b) Creation of a Registry of Copy-Protection Systems\n(1) The Librarian of Congress, in consultation with the Register or Copyrights and\nwith the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the\nDepartment of Commerce, shall create and maintain a registry of copy-protection\nsystems -\n(A) describing the protocols, algorithms, procedures, services, components, or\nother features embodied within the system that constitute control of access\nover the copyrighted material\n(B) identifying the owner of the copy-protection system identified in (b)(1)(A)\nincluding contact address\n(C) naming the works protected by the system, copyright management\ninformation defined in §1202(c), and other information deemed relevant by\nthe Librarian\n(D) identifying the authors of the works identified in (b)(1)(C) including contact\naddress\n(E) possessing the means to be searched, indexed, or otherwise publicly accessed\nin its entirety\n(2) The Librarian shall have the authority to determine and render fees necessary to\noperate this registry to be charged to owners of copy-protection systems\n(c) This subsection shall not be construed to deny, prevent, or inhibit those rights\nretained and expressed in §106 - §112 governing limitations on exclusive rights of\nthis Title\nAmended §1203: Civil Remedies\n(a) Civil Actions.-- Only those works and accompanying copy-protection systems duly\nregistered with the Librarian of Congress may bring a civil action in an appropriate\nUnited States district court for such violation described in §1201 and §1202\n\nThis registry is a limited reform in the current jungle of copyright jurisprudence. It would\nresemble the current patent system in that the protections claimed are identifiable and\npublicly searchable. Moreover, the legislation offers considerable protections and\nincentives to copyright holders who are willing to register their protection systems and\nassociated authored works. However, the limited scope also compels these holders to\nspecifically define what constitutes their system as well as what compromises \"control of\naccess.\" In this more narrow formulation of circumvention or infringement, plaintiffs\ncannot broadly assert that the potential or capability for a circumventive act is illegal, but\nrather that a specific action compromising their specifically defined \"control of access\" is\nthe act of circumvention. In this way, potential plaintiffs bear a far heavier burden of\nproof, but also have far stronger grounds upon which to bring a complaint if their system\nand protected works are specifically enumerated.\nIt is important to note that this legislation is narrowly tailored to copyright-protection\nsystems not every instance or occurrence of a copyrighted work. In this way, much of the\nbody of copyright jurisprudence on fair use remains untouched, unlike the current DMCA\nimplementation. Only the limited subset of copyrighted works with copy-protection\nsystems are impacted by this system rather than any \"original works of authorship fixed\nin any tangible medium of expression.\"15 The legislation does not develop any metric for\ndefining intent to circumvent, but that is a matter for the common law to develop. While\nmotivation or intent is important in determining the outcomes of criminal charges like\nmurder or assault, legislators cannot anticipate every instance or occurrence in advance.\nSimilarly, one's civil responsibility should extend as far as he or she is able to voluntarily\nsubmit to the act of circumvention and infringement. With this narrow construction of\ncircumvention rather than the current narrow understanding of fair use, plaintiffs should\nbe able to identify the specific act of illegal circumvention from this enumerated body of\nactions, rather than being able to broadly assert that any activity is circumventive. It then\nfalls within the courts' traditional realm of discretion to determine the merit of the\ncharges against these specific definitions of circumvention in the registry.\n15 US Code Title 17. §102: Subject Matter of Copyright: In General\n\nWhile this proposal imposes a serious burden of proof on the copyright holder to seek an\ninjunction, compensation, or other remedies from the alleged infringer, it is reasonable\ngiven the considerable protections now afforded to copyrights. Copyright infringement is\na serious offense, not the legal means to eliminate competitors or legitimate uses of a\nproduct. While the law should not implicitly protect pirates by requiring an onerous\nburden of proof from the plaintiffs, it should not burden the masses by allowing copyright\nholders to file suit against competitors and individuals without the means to defend\nthemselves. The four cases presented are examples of how genuine legislative intent,\nprotecting copyrights in the face of new technology, can be hijacked by special interests.\nA more limited and specific construction of illegal circumvention is required and the\nrights of fair use retained by the people should be specifically and broadly enumerated.\nCopyrights are meant disseminate knowledge, not to be digitized and locked up for\neternity.\n\nDeath of a Cracker: The Failure of the DMCA and How Digital Copyright Can Be Saved\nBy Brian Keegan\n\nFair use is using copyrighted materials without a license\no\nCopyright Act of 1976: \"reproductions... for purposes such as criticism, comment, news\nreporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research.\"\no\nInefficient and deleterious to intent of copyright \"to promote progress\" if every teacher,\nresearcher, or reporter had to submit to the process of obtaining a license.\n\nDigital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) intended to criminalize the act of breaking the anti-\npiracy protections built into copyrighted materials like CDs and DVDs.\no\n\"No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a\nwork protected under this title.\"\no\nCriminalizes any act of circumvention, even those which are necessary to use copyrighted\nmaterials under fair use.\n\nFour cases of the DMCA gone awry\no\nDmitry Sklyarov\n\nDeveloped Advanced eBook Processor (AEBPR) to convert Adobe electronic books\n(eBooks) into less restrictive Portable Document Format (pdf)\n\nNo actual infringment of Adobe's software but \"circumvention\" could potentially\nallow pirates to access protected documents despite legitimate uses\n\nDetained in US for five months, including several weeks in jail, despite Russian\ncitizenship over code\no\nMod-chips\n\nSony copy-protection prevents video game software purchased in one region of the\nworld from being used on PlayStation systems bought in a different region.\n\n\"Mod chips\" eliminates these restrictions and allows players to use all their software,\nregardless of where it is purchased.\n\nPotential capacity for piracy more important than legitimate use, Sony granted\ninjunction despite no infringement of Sony copyright by the manufacturer\no\nLexmark\n\nLexmark printers and toner cartridges authenticate each other excluding competing\nafter-market toner manufacturers\n\nSCC reverse engineered the authentication software/hardware to allow its chips to\ninteroperate with the Lexmark printers.\n\nLexmark files DMCA suit, not claiming copyright infringement, but\ncircumvention of its toner/printer system\n\n9th Circuit finds that DMCA/copyright does not protect monopolistic behavior\no\nBnetd\n\nEmulator allows players to play multiplayer games of licensed on their own servers\nwithout using unstable Blizzard battle.net online service\n\nBlizzard files suit claiming reverse engineering circumvented authentication system,\nbut no copyright infringement of battle.net software by bnetd\n\n8th Circuit issues judgment against bnetd ruling that it enabled access to features\nwithout valid authentication, thus facilitating piracy despite legitimate uses\n\nProposal\no\nShift burden of proof on circumvention to copyright holder, force definition of the protection\nsystem and protected works, and better protect these rights\no\nCreate Registry of Copy-Protection Systems that includes description of the protection\nsystem, copyrighted works, means of contacting owners/authors, and searchable index\no\nRewrite DMCA to protect registered holders of copy-protection systems from\n\"circumvention with intent to infringe copyright\""

      "content": "The Developing World and the Role of Information and\nCommunication Technologies\nInventions and Patents\n6.901\nPresented by Mohamed Haji\n12/14/05\n\nThe Developing World and the Role of Information\nCommunication Technologies\nInformation and communication technologies\nThe lack of an established patent system is one of the major factors contributing\nto the developing nations' inability to match their needs. As a result, inventors do not\nhave the incentives and motivations to develop the technologies that will address many of\nthe existing economic and social problems. Some of the key sectors where technology\ndeficiency is prohibiting progress of the country are education, healthcare and\nagriculture.\nIn this paper, we will address how the use of information and communication\ntechnologies (ICT) can stimulate growth and production in many sectors. We will discuss\ntwo particular innovative ideas that have addressed an existing need in a developing\nnation. In doing so, we will identify some of the major barriers to the use of ICT in the\ndeveloping World. There are many barriers but we will focus on a few including the lack\nof patent systems.\n1. Information and communication technologies can be\nleveraged to enable development\nExtensive studies have shown that ICTs are central to any economy today. Information\nand communication technologies are pushing boundaries in all disciplines. In agriculture,\nthere have been drought-resistant crops developed. In biotechnology, animals have been\ncloned. Hybrid cars that are environmentally friendly have been produced. These are just\n\na few of the transformations enabled by new technologies. Unfortunately, the developing\nworld has had limited contribution in these new fronts. If we harness these existing\ntechnologies we can create ICTs that match local needs and local conditions of\ndeveloping countries. Here are highlights of a few key areas where ICTs can be used to\nsolve existing problems:\nAgricultural Productivity\nMost Third World economies have been and still are agricultural based. With fast\ngrowing populations, it has been difficult to match production and consumption in these\neconomies. Unpredictable or unfavorable weathers have also led to water scarcity and at\ntimes drought. Moreover, urbanization has created labor shortages in rural areas where\nagriculture is centered. With growing populations and shrinking labor sources,\nproductivity has suffered.\nTo address low productivity, governments need to encourage innovations that can spur\ngrowth in agricultural output to sustain the needs of the population. Developing nations\nneed to look at alternatives to traditional agricultural practices. Governments need to look\nat better ways of doing irrigation where rains are scarce. In soil management,\nnanotechnologies like zeolites can provide better and more efficient fertilizers.1 As you\nintroduce new and existing technologies, you need to address issues of sustainability. To\nsustain technologies and new farming methods, you require the expertise. Such expertise\ncan include technicians who can repair broken equipment, scientists who can design new\nand better pesticides etc. Without such support services, long term desires in increasing\n1 Calestous Juma and Lee Yee-Cheong, Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation, UN\nMillennium Project, Innovation: Applying Knowledge in Development, 71\n\nproductivity will not be achieved. More important, the government needs to increase\nefficient market access for farmers. This market access will create profit incentives for\nfarmers thus creating capacity to sustain production.\nInformation Dissemination\nInformation flow is essential as it creates increased knowledge sharing. Knowledge\nsharing can enhance development of best practices in many sectors. In education,\ninformation dissemination can play significant roles. If well established to meet local\nneeds, ICTs can be used to disseminate educational content across borders and across\ncontinents. This sharing may overcome some of the space, time and financial constraints\nin developing nations. I must make clear though that there is need to adopt innovative\ntechnologies that overcome existing bottlenecks. In developing nations, connectivity and\nbandwidth become a limitation to sharing knowledge. It is therefore important to identify\ninnovative ways of bypassing these constraints. Once such bottlenecks are conquered,\nICTs can deliver educational content that is flexible and responsive to the individual in\nthese nations.\nTechnology Transfer\nCollaboration between the Third World and the developed world can create sustainable\ntechnology transfers. Technology transfers can enable cheap ways of producing goods\nand services in the Third World. Since the purchasing power difference between the\ndeveloped and developing nations is enormous, products generated in the First World are\nhardly affordable to those in the Third World. But we can facilitate transfer of technology\n\nto the developing nations so as they can use local raw materials and local labor to\nproduce affordable and appropriate goods. In return, the technology owners can charge\nlicense fees to those who borrow the technology. Such efforts can create collaboration\nthat fosters economic growth of developing nations while creating returns for the First\nWorld.\nAs we discussed in class, Professor Robert Rines and his colleague started a technology\ntransfer program in the 1970's.2 The program brought together companies from\ndeveloped nations and entrepreneurs from developing nations. The companies conducted\nworkshops in Oxford University where they introduced their technologies to the\ninterested developing nations. By the end of the program, 4 developing countries\ntransported technologies to their nations where they produced goods that meyt local\ndemand.\nWhile ICTs can create the capacity to strengthen economies, there are factors that limit\ntheir effective use. These limitations are more prominent in developing nations who have\nthe highest need. As the world becomes global, there will be more reliance on technology\nto drive transactions and economic relationships. As a result, those without state of the art\ntechnology will be left behind. It therefore becomes critical to address these barriers to\nICTs urgently before the developed world enters a new era of information technology.\n2 Professor Robert Rines, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 11/05\n\nSome challenges in using ICTs\nFirst and foremost, lack of infrastructure is the biggest challenge in employing ICTs to\nsolve development problems. Most developing nations have no adequate infrastructure.\nThere are traditional infrastructures like electricity, water, telephone and roads that are\nessential for any society. Without such resources, there is no business that can thrive and\ncompete well. In many of the developing nations, there are limited basic infrastructures in\nthe big cities and almost none in remote regions. This isolates the rural areas that are key\nproducers of agricultural goods. Therefore a large part of the country goes unutilized\nleading to increased poverty. In addition, lack of newer infrastructure has increased the\ntechnological gap between the developed and developing world. Lack of fiber optics\nnetwork has created low bandwidth crisis in Third World countries. Many developing\nnations rely on limited and expensive satellite communications to connect to the rest of\nthe world. But, most of the technologies today require fast internet connections that\nsatellites cannot provide. Therefore the developing world does not have fundamental\ninfrastructure necessary to further economic growth.\nSecondly, governments have been a hurdle for ICT enabled developments. Many of the\ndeveloping nations' governments do not support programs that integrate technologies in\nall sectors of the economy. This is because they have no understanding of how integral\ntechnology is to economic growth. As such, these governments institute policies that\ndiscourage foreign investments. Moreover, governments do not create incentives for\ninnovation and entrepreneurship, two factors that are essential for a sustainable economy.\nICTs need to be flexible and reflective of local needs and local environments to be\neffective. Through innovation, scientists and entrepreneurs can find incentives to create\n\nflexible and appropriate ICTs. If these incentives are not created by the government, then\nICTs cannot meet the needs of developing nations.\nScience and engineering education are integral to innovation and entrepreneurship.\nWithout considerable investment in science and engineering, the basic skills necessary to\nsustain ICTs will not exist. In many developing nations, this is the case. Universities lack\nqualified faculty and the facilities needed to create innovations. Furthermore, developing\ncountries do not have well established patent and intellectual property systems that\nguarantee the rights of the inventor. This in turn allows others to infringe on scientists'\ndiscoveries discouraging them to invent.\nEmbedded in the above limitations are financial constraints. Limited resources and low\nproductivity have crippled the sustainability of these nations' economies. Further\nfinancial constraints have also been experienced due to greater spending on the AIDS\nepidemics.\nTo overcome all these challenges requires innovative technologies that are low cost and\nappropriate to the needs of the locals. Innovative technologies have been used to address\nsome of the needs of these developing nations. I have highlighted two cases that address\nhealthcare and education, two fundamental sectors that are at the core of poverty\neradication.\n\nICT Enabled Developments\n1. HealthNet Uganda: The Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) Project\nHealthNet Uganda tested the use and usefulness of 40 PDAs by medical practitioners to\nconduct an epidemiological survey on malaria, and to access and use medical reference\ntools and texts. Through a partnership with SatelLife, a non-profit organization based in\nMassachusetts, they used the PDA to collect data and to disseminate information between\nhealth professionals.3 As it turned out, the PDA made data collection and analysis quick,\neasy and at a fraction of the cost of traditional pen-and-paper survey. The PDA served as\na portable patient log book. It enabled doctors to do diagnosis and check side effects of\ndrugs on the spot.\nThe project was successful for various reasons:\n9 It addressed an existing need: the lack of information on treatments and disease\nmanagement hinders effective patient care and prevention. Realizing the need for\nmore information to make better informed medical decisions, HealthNet used the\nPDA as a tool.\n9 Identified an affordable and appropriate technology: With the limitations of\ninfrastructure and lack of funds, HealthNet had to identify an appropriate\ntechnology. The PDA used the mobile phone networks bypassing the need for the\nless dense landline network. The PDA is very easy to use and does not require\n3 Uganda Health Information network, http://pda.healthnet.org/, 12/10/05\n\nextensive training, making it more appropriate for people with limited computer\nskills.\n9 Careful selection and adaptation of content: localizing the health content to the\nneeds and environments of Uganda were requirements for success\n9 Created local ownership: by collaborating with local schools and hospitals, the\nproject created a sense of ownership for the locals. This in turn created an\nefficient execution as the locals were interested in seeing the success of the\nproject.\nAs we have seen in the HealthNet Uganda project, it is essential to address an existing\nneed when implementing ICT initiatives to address health issues. Choosing an\nappropriate and affordable technology, localizing content and creating local ownership of\nthe project are all key ingredients for success.\n2. MIT Africa Internet Technology Initiative\nThe MIT-Africa Internet Technology Initiative (MIT-AITI) is an innovative program\ncreated and managed by MIT students. MIT-AITI integrates computers and internet\ntechnology into the education of students in African schools.4 MIT-AITI achieves this\ngoal by sending MIT undergraduate and graduate students to three African nations for six\nweeks in order to conduct intensive classroom and laboratory sessions. The MIT-AITI\nprogram equips students with programming tools like Java, Linux and PHP. In addition,\nMIT-AITI runs an entrepreneurship course to encourage students to be innovators.\nThrough this course, students get to develop their business ideas. MIT-AITI holds an\n4 MIT Africa Internet Technology Initiative, http://web.mit.edu/mit-africa/www/home/, 12/08/05\n\nentrepreneurship competition at the end of the course and sponsors the winning ideas'\ninitial phase.\nMIT-AITI is a great example where technology transfer between developed and\ndeveloping world can create opportunities for students. Through MIT-AITI, many\nstudents develop ownership of their business ideas and try to implement it. It is important\nto note that MIT-AITI taps into the local minds of the countries they visit and empower\nthese minds to create innovative solutions for their community.\nMIT-AITI is similar to HealthNet Uganda since they both address an existing need of the\nlocals. MIT-AITI provides knowledge that students would not otherwise get due to\nlimited resources of their institutions. Moreover, MIT-AITI encourages entrepreneurship\nand innovation, two things that form the basis for economic empowerment to fight\npoverty.\nOvercoming Bottlenecks in ICTs\nAs I have shown with MIT-AITI and HealthNet Uganda, successful ICT projects have to\nhave capacity building capabilities. In order to do so, ICT projects have to address\nexisting needs by adopting innovative technologies that are affordable, appropriate and\nflexible to the needs of the locals. To do this, we need to do the following:\n9 Educate governments: governments need to realize the power of ICTs in\ncombating development issues. Governments have to actively promote use of\ninformation communication technologies across all sectors of the economy. And\nmore fundamentally, governments have to commit to building infrastructure\n\nnecessary to carry out ICT projects. Infrastructure is not only physical but also\nacademic. Third World governments have to commit necessary capital to produce\nand train scientists, technologists and engineers in order to create a capacity to\ninnovate and invent. And more importantly, the governments have to grant\ninventors the exclusive right to his/her own discovery. By doing so, it promotes\nthe progress of science and the useful arts.5\n9 Promote Innovation: innovation is at the center of poverty reduction policies. As\nthe United Nations Millennium Report asserts, technological innovation will not\nonly create technological transformations, but its significance will increase over\ntime.6 ICTs can drive innovation if the local needs are matched with existing\ntechnologies. To achieve technological innovation, you have to invest in\nuniversities. Universities are centers for innovation and by investing in them, you\ntap into great sources of ideas that can transform economies. Therefore, there has\nto be dedicated investment from the government and private sector in university\neducation.\n9 Create Transferable Technology Platforms: technology in developing nations\ncan be expensive to access and create. It is therefore important to create platforms\nthat can have far-reaching implications on the economy. ICTs are integral to\nmany sectors of the economy and cut across many fields and should therefore be a\nfocus for developing nations.\n5 Dr. Robert Rines, Create or Perish, page 10.\n6 Calestous Juma and Lee Yee-Cheong, Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation, UN\nMillennium Project, Innovation: Applying Knowledge in Development, 16\n\n9 Leverage Existing Technologies: existing technologies like the mobile phone\ncan be leveraged to solve problems. In the case of HealthNet Uganda, PDA was\nthe right technology to address the information gap, because it made use of the\nmobile technology that was more widespread than landline. It is therefore\nimportant to consider existing technologies when drafting solutions to\ndevelopment issues.\n9 Include Developing Nations in ICT Initiatives: multinational corporations need\nto consider developing nations when creating new technologies or products. This\nis because the needs in developing countries are very different often times. More\nimportantly, affordability is a big issue since the purchasing power of developing\neconomies is limited. It is therefore important to think of alternatives for the\ndeveloping world.\n9 Promote Collaboration: collaboration through technology transfers or\nknowledge sharing can spur huge economic growth in developing countries. The\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has spearheaded knowledge sharing\nbetween academic institutions. MIT, through its OpenCourseWare initiative, has\nput more than half its subjects' content online. This content can be accessed by\nanyone for free as long as they have an internet connection. Such initiatives can\ngo a long way in providing opportunities to those who cannot afford it.\n\nWho are the stakeholders\nThe use of ICT to increase economic growth and empower people in developing regions\nhas to be a global movement. As the world becomes increasingly connected, countries\nwill interact economically and socially even more. Therefore, one country's lack of\ncapacity to play on a global scale will be another country's problem. It is therefore\nimperative that we elevate the developing countries to a position where they can\nparticipate and compete in the world economy as countries converge. And as such, the\nfollowing entities have to work together to establish ICT in developing countries:\n9 United Nations\n9 Developed and developing governments\n9 Private sector and multinational corporations\nConclusion\nCreating opportunities for the poor is the key to eradicating poverty and initiating\neconomic growth in Third World countries. While we are very far from eradicating\npoverty, ICTs can provide sustainable and scalable solutions that can advance the cause.\nAs ICTs become more important in an ever increasingly global world, it becomes\nimperative for all stakeholders to address the rising digital divide in the world. It is of\nutmost urgency that we come up with affordable, appropriate and flexible technologies\nthat can stimulate unprecedented economic growths in Third World countries."

      "content": "Globalization is a Catalyst for Change in Intellectual Property Systems: Case\nStudies in India and China\n\nSisir Botta, Christopher Tsai\nMay 10, 2004\n6.931\n\n1. Abstract\nThe recent forces of increasing globalization have forced India and China to\nreform their intellectual property stance to become competitive in the new global\neconomy. Prior to the 1970s, both India and China had intellectual property systems that\nwere flawed and relatively powerless to provide any real protections to individual\ninventors. This paper argues that the recent overhauling of the intellectual property\nsystem in both India and China are a direct result of globalization. The surge in\nglobalization following the conclusion of World War II provided the competitive\nenvironment necessary to initiate change within the systems governing intellectual\nproperty in both countries.\n\n2. Background\nThroughout history, each generation has experienced unique political, economic,\nand social forces. Interplay between these dynamic elements form the centerpiece of\nestablishing any nation state. Striving to meet the basic needs and comforts of their\ncitizens, these states for the most part remained free-standing. However, this century has\nbeen marked by unprecedented technological changes that enable a worldwide\nconnectedness. While this idea referred to courier mail or travel in the past, nowadays\nthe worldwide web, mobile communications, and mass media link individuals. The\n\neconomic implications of such global associations are serious. Economic progress has\noften been tied to technological progress. Ensuring such progress necessitates an\neffective patent system, which essentially is progress appearing in law. Developing\nnations have confronted the predicament of economic progress with little success. In the\ncase of India and China, decades of feeble patent policy and intellectual property laws\nblocked such progress. Only recently due to the arm of globalization have these nations\nseriously pursued a strong patent system, planting the seeds for future economic success.\n\n3.1 Historical Weaknesses in Indian Patent System\nJust as the origins of the American patent system are fundamentally tied to Great\nBritain, India's colonial counterpart played a significant role to establish and dominate\nthe Indian patent system. Dating back to 1856, patent policy began when the Act VI\nenacted a protection of inventions based on the British Patent Law of 1852, granting\nexclusive rights to inventors for 14 years. Under imperialism, industrial development in\nIndia followed British interests with limited research, development, or innovation.\nPolicymakers fully focused on patents only after independence, and even still, little\nprogress was made according to two expert committees. The Patent Enquiry Committee\n(1948-1950) declared \"the Indian patent system has failed in its main purpose...to\nstimulate inventions among Indians and to encourage exploiting these inventions for\nindustrial purposes\" (Ramanna). The Ayyangar Committee (1957-1959) reported that\nforeigners held 80-90% of the patents in India and were exploiting the system for\nmonopolistic control of the market.\n\nIn response, the Patent Act of 1970 reformed the system, restricting patentability\nto process but not product patents in the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.\nMany global parties disputed this measure since many firms could simply copy\ntechnology developed abroad. Since then, India has undergone two major waves of\namendments in the Patent Acts of 1999 and 2002. Despite these changes, India remains\nunable to break into the ranks of the world's wealthiest nations.\n\nMost obviously, this economic state is largely due to the poor physical\ninfrastructure of the Indian patent system. Until very recently, only a disconnected\nnetwork of offices was established across the nation with poor information access.\nComputerized records and a website with online search functions are finally being\nimplemented. The division could not even establish its own identity until the newly\ndeveloped logo for intellectual property offices. Consequently, it is no surprise that the\nsystem faces a backlog of approximately 40,000 unexamined applications. Even the legal\nramifications of the patent system are weak with sluggish enforcement of patent. Some\ncases have taken 10 years for resolution and payment of damages. Legal personnel also\ndo not carry a full proficiency with all the recent amendments.\nIndia's current status in the global economy may also be attributed to flawed\npatent policy. While some nations such as Korea and Japan have transitioned from post-\nwar phases, India's post-independent era was marked by well-intentioned but impractical\ngoals. The Japanese model emphasized incremental innovation through certain patent\nprovisions such as utility models (require less inventiveness, scope), single-claim\nrequirements, and pre-grant disclosure of applications; hence, the Japanese strategy\nallowed for \"catching up\" by using patent laws to diffuse technology through all sectors\n\nof industry. On the other hand, India's 1970 Patent Policy overlooked \"utility models\" to\nfocus on preventing foreign monopolies and high priced medicines and foods. The act\nseverely restricted the scope and term of patents. Several areas were excluded from\npatent protection such as the restriction to process but not product patents in food,\nmedicine, and chemical companies. Indhira Gandhi expressed these fears in 1982, \"The\nidea of a better-ordered world is once in which medical discoveries will be free of patents\nand there will be no profiteering from life and death\" (Ramanna). Specifically, the\npharmaceutical industry has suffered the policies induced by such fears. Short-term\nprices may rise, but \"a strong patent system will ensure competition in the form of newer\nand better drugs to more people at reasonable prices\" (Adelmann). Without adequate\nprotection for innovation, there is no incentive to research and produce new products for\ndisease.\n3.2 Historical Weaknesses in Chinese Patent System\nThe government in a developing country may be set up against the idea of\nintellectual property at the outset. If a government's conception of what is good for its\ncitizens does not include private intellectual property protection, it clearly will have a\nresultant weak patent system. A primary example of such government is the communist\nChinese government before and during Chairman Mao's leadership. The communist\nrhetoric exalted the idea of collectivism and the value of the publicly owned property. In\nthis government conception, granting individual private property was not only frowned\nupon, it was taken by the state for public usage. Aptly put, \"communism discourages\nindividual property\" (D'Antico). It can only be expected that intellectual property would\nnot be protected, but rather be made accessible to the public for use. This naturally lent\n\nitself to a weak intellectual property system with little to no enforcement of individual\nrights and claims to novel ideas.\nCultural dynamics set against securing ownership of private property in\ndeveloping countries also will lead to a weaker patent system. China is another example\nof such a dynamic playing itself out in a developing country. The Chinese cultural\nopinion on being entitled to your own ideas at the exclusion of others has been relatively\nlow. Imitation and copying is viewed as a form of compliment rather than disrespect in\nthis culture. In this the cultural standard is correctly assessed by experts in that the\n\"Chinese view copying as flattery\" (D'Antico). Therefore, it would be very difficult to\nimplement a hard-nosed patent system that was rigorously against infringement if the\nculture of the developing country itself was set toward the idea of copying rather than\nagainst it. Many of these cultural ideas had been formed by Confucius, whose influential\nphilosophies informed a great deal of the paradigm to which the Chinese ascribed. In this\nphilosophy, a key component to well being was a valuing of personal moral development\nover personal economic gain. Because of this way of thinking, the Chinese were laissez-\nfaire in their efforts to provide a strong structure by which individuals could\neconomically benefit from their own brain-children.\n\n4.1 The Invisible Hand of Globalization: India\n\nAs the millennium turns, the world is undergoing a tremendous globalization\nenabled by technology. Now, more than ever, disparate locations are connected by\nwebsites, mobile communications networks, and other mediums. Economically, no\ncountry can survive in isolation from the globalizing world, especially developing\n\nnations. Competition between countries affects all, and intellectual property protection\nand patents play a critical role in motivating innovation and competition.\nAlthough the Indian patent system can be optimized further, it has taken serious\nsteps to cooperate with the global economy. As a signatory to establishing the World\nTrade Organization (WTO), India has committed to international intellectual property\nrights legislation, specifically the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual\nProperty Rights (TRIPs). This treaty requires nations to compose their laws to comply\nwith international obligations. Many of the controversial policies of the 1970 Patents Act\nare being amended; the first act in 1999 created an IP Appellate Board as the mediator for\nappeals of the decisions of the Controller of Patents. In the second act in 2002, the\ndefinition of an \"invention\" was broadened to include a product or process with an\n\"inventive step\" and \"capable of industrial application.\" The term of a patent was\nextended from 14 to 20 years, and patent claims are to be published 18 months after\nfiling. Even the pharmaceutical industry is set to enter the intellectual property regime in\n2005. Thus, India continues to promote an international alliance for standardized patent\npractices.\n\nEven more importantly, globalization has engendered an internal domestic policy\nchange within India as seen in the Patent Amendment Acts of 1999 and 2002. In the past\ndecade alone, liberalization of economic policies has created a more westernized notion\nof intellectual property rights in political and industrial parties. Surprisingly, the\ndominant BJP party, once a vehement opponent of patent reform, even promoted the idea.\nIn the corporate arena, India has witnessed a rise of the modern, professional business\nemphasizing technology and economic advancement. A new movement for the\n\nprotection of knowledge has emerged. The Indian Institutes of Technology have\nspearheaded the effort. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), a chain\nof laboratories, has created an aura bolstering the value of a strong patent system. It\nstunningly defeated a United States patent on indigenous knowledge of turmeric. Such\nacts have inspired others to harness intellectual property for economic advancement. The\ngroup has also played a large role in lobbying for the recent Patent Amendment Acts.\nThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) cited weak patent structure for the\ntechnological backwardness, calling for compliance with the TRIPs guidelines. In line\nwith MIT Professor Robert Rines, the International Institute of Intellectual Property was\nestablished in India, announcing the slogan, \"Patent or Perish\". Martin Adelman claims\nthat \"This is vastly different from what it used to be in pre-reform days...there is a\ngreater level of confidence among Indians\" (Adelmann).\n4.2 The Invisible Hand of Globalization: China\nAn increasingly global economy would invoke the leadership of developing\ncountries to rethink previously outmoded ways of thinking to be competitive in the global\nmarket. The Chinese socialist government is a primary example of such a shift in\nparadigms in an effort to be a leading global power. Prior to 1976, the leadership in\nChina was the primary culprit in stifling any thinking in the realm of increased exposure\nto foreign markets and economic influences. In more recent years, a strong push for\nreform after the era of Mao Zedong post 1978 by the Chinese government marked a\nvictory for the proponents of a more outward facing China. Global forces such as foreign\ncapitalistic investment, and an increasingly global economy led Chinese policy makers\nand political leaders to aggressively seek solutions for their economic needs outside of\n\ntraditional decision making patterns. Motivations for such a push from the Chinese\npolitical leadership derived from a large desire to become not only a contender in the\nglobal economy, but a leader as well.\nDeveloping countries such as China are strongly motivated by a desire to become\nthe next \"modern\" nation. Consequently, such modernization forces have influenced\npolicy makers to idealize the picture of the Western standard of living. Especially\nrampant in the China is the idolization of Western lifestyle, in the image of financial\nfreedom supposedly allowing for near limitless purchasing power. The picture that\ndeveloping countries such as China hold up as the Western ideal have lead to a trend of\neconomic reform is strikingly progressive. In discussing China's reform in policy, one\nexpert claims \"The open-door policy is an essential element of the economic reform\nprocess\" (Chow). This new open door policy that China has taken in its dealings with\nother nations, especially in economic matters have given its people the opportunity to see\nthe availability of the individualized mode of thinking prevalent in Western countries.\nPerspectives on modernized countries lead China to shift toward the capitalistic form of\neconomics that marks most Western nations today. Capitalism was a new animal in the\ndevelopment of the growing Chinese economy through the 1980s until now. The change\nin economic systems however contested and criticized, provided the groundwork upon\nwhich new reforms in policy could be made.\n\n5.1 Indian Intellectual Property Reforms\nWithin the past decade, the Indian economy has initiated the long road to\nbecoming one of the world's elite players in the global market. In large part, the\n\nglobalization movement has engendered the motive and desire for the country to begin\npatent reforms in order to achieve this goal. The Indian government has made substantial\nprogress in upgrading the physical plant and integrity of the patent system. New offices\nin each of the four major cities are planned to be operational by 2004 under a unified\nbusiness complex. New examiners have been recruited and trained, and transactions are\nnow computerized. Corporate plans and work manuals are being created to ensure\nstandardized procedure that is simple and responsive to needs of users.\nBolstered by industrial and political support, the 1999 and 2002 Patent\nAmendment Acts are only the beginning of a massive program to revamp the patent\nsystem. These changes in outlook and policy have contributed to a general rise in patent\napplications (Figure 1).\nPatent Applications in India\nYear\nNo. of Patents\n\nFigure 1: Patent Applications in India, 1970-2001.\nSource: Prabuddha Ganguli, Gearing Up for Patents the Indian Scenario(1998),p.21;and for the years 98-\n2001 from TIFAC (1998 updated 2002), Database on Patent Applications filed in India.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, patent applications remained generally static; however, then\nfollows a sudden surge in applications, reflecting the rising tide of globalization and the\npatent reforms that it produced. In addition to the rise in patents, Indians are increasingly\nlooking to patent their inventions abroad (Figure 2). Again, the curve begins to rapidly\nincrease in the mid-1990s.\n\nFigure 2: India and China Patents in the US\nBhattacharya, Sujit, and Pradosh Nath. Using patent statistics as a measure of \"technological\nassertiveness\": A China India Comparison. Current Science. Vol. 83, NO. 1, 10 July 2002.\n\nAnother aspect of the impact of patent reforms is the expanding collaboration\nbetween firms. Organizations such as CSIR and the IITs are crucial in this regard, but the\npractice is still relatively young and growing.\n5.2 Chinese Intellectual Property Reforms\nAlthough the idea had been proposed by previous forms of Chinese government,\nnot until the 1970s did China seriously begin to recognize the need for legal and\ngovernment protection of private intellectual property. In response to the tide of change\n\nconcurrent with the increasingly global economy, the government engaged in numerous\nlaw and statute creating exercises that provided legal terms for prosecuting against\ninfringements on intellectual properties. After observing that technical advancements\nwere an integral part of the positive forces behind the development of a healthy and\nprosperous nation. Most clearly, the primary motivation for such a move by the\ngovernment was to increase foreign investment in the Chinese economy.\nNot until the past two decades did a radical change in the paradigm of thinking\ntake place to promote the enforcement of intellectual property laws and statutes. The end\ngoal of the Chinese political leadership was now to promote economic development and\npositive social change. It was realized that this goal would be significantly helped by the\npromotion of technology and science, in that in these fields lay the \"premier productive\nforces\" and that they were \"critical to economic and social development\" (Oake). In this,\nChina warmed to new foreign trade and technology in its dealings, whereas before it had\nnot considered the possibility. Correspondingly, large amounts of reform steps have been\ntaken to improve the current system of intellectual property protection. China has joined\nthe Paris Convention, the Madrid Agreement, the Universal Copyright Convention, and\nthe Berne Convention intellectual property treaty agreements as a move to be supportive\nto individual inventors and innovators. It has been claimed that \"In the past ten years,\nthe Chinese government has enacted an impressive number of intellectual property laws\ncovering trademarks, patents, copyrights, computer software, unfair competition, and\ntechnology contracts\" (Oake). Also noteworthy is China's entrance into the WIPO, or\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization. During the decades of the 1980s and 1990s,\nlegal reform in the passage of the Chinese Patent Law of 1984, and subsequent\n\namendments made in 1992 have served to protect the rights of intellectual property\nowners. These reforms mark the significant positive shift in the Chinese government's\nposture toward intellectual property rights.\nForeign pressure both economically and politically have motivated the new\nchanges in the Chinese attitude toward intellectual property and resultant economic\nreform. The United States in particular in its dealing with China has been outspoken and\nactive in pursuing political action against the Chinese government. The US threatened\neconomic sanctions, opposition to China's entrance into the WTO, and revoking other\ntrade related benefits in an effort to protect the infringement of intellectual property\ntaking place overseas within China. Appropriately, China responded with many of the\naforementioned treaty agreements and reforms to appease the US, and other claims to\nintellectual property infringement. The Chinese intellectual property system has benefited\nfrom such external pressures and the system in place now significantly stronger than its\nhistorical precursors. American and Chinese intellectual property systems can eventually\nresult in a \"harmonious relationship between the two countries, to foster better mutual\nunderstanding between each other, and to promote a self-sustainable intellectual property\nregime in China\" (Yu). Future forces in the global market economy can only lead to\nfurther improvements in the Chinese intellectual property system.\n\n6. Conclusion\nWe have shown that the forces of globalization have caused India and China to\nreform their intellectual property positions in letter and in action. Both countries are now\nleading contenders in the fight to be the fastest developing country. The weak\nintellectual property systems in both India and China were revamped to provide real\nprotections to individual inventors. Globalization after the conclusion of World War II\nwrought the necessary occasion to bring about change within the patenting systems of\nboth countries. India and China have risen to the occasion, and are poised to prevail in\nthe future global economy.\n\nReferences\n1. Yu, Peter. Abstract.

      "content": "Cynthia Caramana\n6.901 Final Project\nDec 17, 2003\nImplications of the World Trade Organization's Intellectual Property Policies on\nThird-World Countries' Access to Vital Medicines\nOver the last few years, international debate has been raging over the impact of\ninternational patent law on public health and access to medicines. On the one hand,\npharmaceutical investments in drug research and development (R&D) have produced lifesaving\ndrugs that have turned once-fatal illnesses into manageable conditions. On the other, the high\ncost of the drugs often exceeds a developing country's ability to pay for them. At the heart of the\ncontroversy is the World Trade Organization's (WTO) intellectual property policies set forth in\nthe Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (referred to as TRIPS),\nadopted in 1994. TRIPS was designed to spur innovation by creating a uniform international\nframework for protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. However, many\ndeveloping countries view the agreement as a barrier to obtaining affordable patented drugs.\nThis report will provide some background on the pharmaceutical industry and examine the\ndevelopment of the TRIPS policy from its advent in 1994 to its current form. Moreover, it will\ndetail and analyze the policy's ramifications for drug accessibility, particularly with respect to\nthird-world countries inflicted with AIDS, and finally propose some new changes and additions\nto TRIPS that would better facilitate drug distribution to poor countries.\nPharmaceuticals play a significant social role and are crucial for sustaining the\nfundamental human right to health. For this reason, pharmaceutical products are classified as\nessential good, with the understanding that they must be accessible to all people. However, this\nconcept of accessibility for all falls short of people living in the worlds poorest countries, such as\nthose of sub-Saharan Africa. According to estimates from UNAIDS1, 34.3 million people in the\nworld have AIDS and 24.5 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly 19 million have died\nfrom AIDS, 3.8 million of them children under the age of 15. One of the most alarming\nspeculations is that by the year 2010 there will be 40 million AIDS orphans in Africa, most of\n1 An umbrella group for five U.N. agencies, the World Bank and the World Health Organization\n\nwho will have grown up with little or no social structure. The economies of AIDS-inflicted\ncountries have suffered from a lack of labor as working men and women fall sick or leave their\njobs to take care of their loved ones who are inflicted with the disease. Less than 7% of people\nworldwide with HIV and AIDS have access to life prolonging antiretroviral medicine [1].\nAlthough many factors contribute to this lack of access, the prohibitive cost of AIDS drugs\nremains a major barrier. Pharmaceutical companies maintain that the high prices of drugs reflect\nthe R&D necessary for creating the drug. The financial data in Table 1, however, suggests that\nR&D expenditures are relatively small compared to marketing expenses [2].\nCompany\nRevenue\n(Net sales in\n$ million)\nTable 1. Financial Data of Top Pharmaceutical Companies in 2000\nPercent of Revenue Allocated to\nMerck\nPfizer\nBristol Myers Squibb\nAbbott Laboratories\nEli Lilly\nSchering-Plough\n40,563\n29,574\n18,216\n13,241\n10,862\n9,615\nProfit\n17%\n13%\n26%\n20%\n26%\n25%\nMarketing\n&\nAdvertising\n15%\n39%\n30%\n21%\n30%\n36%\nR&D\n5%\n15%\n11%\n10%\n19%\n14%\nPharmaceutical companies, including Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, have recently slashed\nprices for AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan African countries, selling them below-cost to help stem the\ntide of the epidemic. Nevertheless, in many developing countries, the cost of treating AIDS\npatients far surpasses their annual health care budgets, which are commonly much less than $100\nper patient. In the meantime, patent protection for pharmaceuticals is sprinkled here and there\nthroughout the developing world. In the absence of patent protection, developing countries can\nmake and buy generic alternatives at a fraction of the brand-name price. Generic drug\ncompanies in India for example can provide a year's worth of triple anti-retroviral therapy at less\nthan 3% of the cost of the same-patented therapy in the United States. Moreover, competition\nfrom generic producers has resulted in the lowering of prices by large multinational\n\npharmaceutical companies. The following table shows that the price of Zantac, an anti-ulcer\nmedication, varies from market to\nTable 2. Price of 100 Tablets of Zantac\nIndia\nBangladesh\nAustralia\nThailand\nIndonesia\nThe Philippines\nCanada\nTanzania\nSouth Africa\nMongolia\nChile\nUS Dollars\nmarket, irrespective of per capita income for the designated country [3]. The pricing, however,\nexhibits a strong correlation with the existence of generic substitutes for each country. The price\nof patented Zantac is much cheaper in India than in Mongolia, for instance, due to competition\nfrom India's generic substitute for Zantac.\nMember of the WTO adopted the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\nProperty Rights (TRIPS) in 1994, which introduced intellectual property rules into the\nmultilateral trading system for the first time. Covering not only patents but also trademarks and\ncopyrights, TRIPS lays down minimum standards of IP protection and outlines a set of\nprocedures for enforcement. Under TRIPS, a patent is granted by a specific country or a regional\noffice acting for several countries, to give an inventor exclusive rights over the manufacture and\nuse of his invention for a fixed period of time - a minimum of 20 years for pharmaceutical\ninventions. Similar to US criterion, patentability under TRIPS requires that an invention be\nnovel, useful, and non-obvious, \"patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products\nor processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, involve an inventive step\n\nand are capable of industrial application [4].\" Moreover, Article 28 of TRIPS states that the\npatent holder has the legal right to prevent unauthorized use, making, selling, and importing of\nhis patented product or process. In accordance with TRIPS, WTO members are required to\nintroduce IP standards and develop systems of patent review and enforcement that closely model\nthat of the US and other developed countries. The major shift for countries such as India is that\nthe TRIPS agreement requires a patent regime that recognizes product patents for chemicals and\npharmaceuticals. The earlier Indian Patent Act allowed for only process patents in these areas,\nwhich created the possibility of reverse engineering drugs.\nShortly after TRIPS was adopted, many developing countries expressed concerns over its\nadverse implications for accessing essential drugs and addressing public health crises. Namely,\nincreased patent protection leads to higher drug prices making them unaffordable to a vast\nmajority of people who need them. Moreover, developing countries predicted that the access gap\nbetween rich and poor, would continue to increase, especially if producers in developing\ncountries have to wait for 20 years before they can have access to innovations. Under pressure\nfrom humanitarian groups and strong protests worldwide, WTO members felt the need to\nrespond to concerns about the possible implications of the TRIPS Agreement for access to\nmedicines. They also tried to clarify some of the sticking points of TRIPS, namely the built-in\nflexibilities to protect public health that the pharmaceutical companies opposed. At the 2001\nmeeting in Doha, Qatar, WTO members amended TRIPS with a separate declaration referred to\nas the Doha Declaration. Some of the main points of the Doha Declaration are the following:\n- Least developed countries have until 2016 to set up systems for patent review and\nenforcement. The deadline had been originally set for 2006 [5].\n- Members are allowed to license a patented technology without the holder's consent in the\nevent of an emergency or situation of extreme urgency [6].\n- Each member has the right to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other\ncircumstances of extreme urgency, it being understood that public health crises, including\nthose relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other epidemics, can represent a\nnational emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency [7].\nThe Doha Declaration emphasizes that the TRIPS Agreement should not prevent member\ngovernments from acting to protect public health. It affirms a government's right to use the\nTRIPS flexibilities in order to protect their nation's public health. However, the Doha\n\nDeclaration did not specify conditions for parallel imports (a measure that allows a country to\nbuy the cheapest source, regardless of the stated domestic price), but instead provided the\ninfamous Paragraph 6, which ran as follows: \"We recognize that WTO Members with\ninsufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector could face difficulties in\nmaking effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement. We instruct the\nCouncil for TRIPS to find an expeditious solution to this problem and to report to the General\nCouncil before the end of 2002 [8].\"\nAfter much dispute and protest by the US government, the deadlock over intellectual\nproperty and public health was finally broken on August 30, 2003. The provision allows poorer\ncountries to import cheaper generics made under compulsory licensing, whereas before, Article\n31 of TRIPS restricted compulsory licensed drugs to domestic use only. Although the new\nprovision enables the poorest countries to buy essential drugs at the cheapest prices, it is littered\nwith restrictions. An eligible importing member can only be a \"least developed\" country or a\ndeveloping country that does not have adequate facilities to produce the drug in question. The\nimporting country must make a notification to the TRIPS Council that:\n- Specifies the names and expected quantities of the products needed.\n- Verifies the eligibility of importing member in question (other than a least developed\ncountry member) - that it has insufficient manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical\nsector for the products in question.\nImporting countries also have to ensure legal administrative means of preventing re-exportation\nof any such drugs. Similarly, the compulsory license issued by the exporting member has to\nperform the following:\n- Determine the exact amount necessary to meet the needs of the eligible importing\nmember.\n- Provide special packaging to distinguish the exported drugs from their domestic\ncounterparts.\n- Post on a website the information relating to the quantities being supplied to each\ndestination and the distinguishing features of the products.\n- Notify the TRIPS Council of the grant of the license, including the conditions attached to\nit. The information provided has to include the name and address of the licensee, the\nproducts for which the license has been granted, the quantities for which it has been\n\ngranted, the countries to which the products are to be supplied, and the duration of the\nlicense.\nThough the addition of the Doha Declaration and the August 30 provision to TRIPS are\nprogressive steps towards making essential drugs affordable for even the poorest people, the\npolicies have been widely criticized for being too restrictive and laden with time-consuming\nbureaucracy. Moreover, compulsory licensing is not the final solution to bringing third-world\ncountries affordable access to patented drugs because it relies upon the capability to reverse\nengineer or import the product without the cooperation of the patent holder. The Aug 30\nprovision that allows least-developed nations to import from a nation holding a compulsory\nlicense relies on the assumption that the disease strains and patterns are similar in the two\ncountries. An antiretroviral medicine that is effective at slowing the progression of HIV strains\nin Brazil, for example, might not be as effective on the strains in South Africa. Another concern\nover the policies is that they bog down the process with bureaucracy, preventing a timely\ndelivery of drugs to those in desperate need. For many infected with HIV, having to wait a year,\nmonth, or even another day to receive life-prolonging drugs results in their children becoming\norphans.\nAnother obstacle is posed by the pressure that wealthy countries put on developing\ncountries to accept trade negotiation proposals that greatly restrict their rights provided in the\nDoha Declaration and thus severely limit their ability to safeguard public health. A most notable\nexample is the Free Trade Areas of the Americas (FTAA) trade agreement that imposes extreme\nIP restrictions on its members. Under the FTAA agreement, Compulsory licenses for\npharmaceuticals are restricted to a few diseases (under the Doha Declaration there are no disease\nrestrictions) and prohibited from export, patents are extended beyond 20 years, and impose\nexclusive rights on pharmaceutical test data that significantly delay the introduction of generic\ndrugs even when no patent barriers exist.\nDespite some of their shortcomings, the addition of the Doha Declaration and the August\n30 provision have been two major steps in the right direction. I believe that further steps should\nbe taken to reduce some of the bureaucracy required for exporting essential drugs made under\ncompulsory licenses to poor countries that lack the infrastructure to produce them. I also\npropose that the pricing for essential life-saving drugs be regulated according to a scale based on\n\nper-capita income, so that poorer countries like Tanzania are not required to pay more for a drug\nthan much wealthier countries like Canada (see Table 2). The pricing scale should be set to\nmake the drug affordable to the average citizens of any given country. If the pharmaceutical\ncorporations are unwilling to sell their drugs at greatly reduced prices, then generic companies\nshould be given free reign to sell their versions in those countries. It might not be \"fair\" to make\ncitizens of wealthier countries pay more for the same drug; however, denying poor people the\nright to life by withholding life-saving drugs is a far worse injustice. Though it may sound cliche,\nthe message from the Spiderman movie: \"with great power comes great responsibility\" applies to\nUS and other leading countries of the world. These leaders have a great opportunity to use their\npower and influence to ease some of the suffering and death that epidemics are inflicting on the\nrest of the world.\nReferences\n1.

The type of license you choose may\ninfluence the popularity, security, reliability, quality, featureset, and userbase of your software. In\norder to pick the correct license, you should first understand the kinds of rights that many licenses\ntend to address, and what licenses are frequently used. You should then consider the goals of your\nproject, and the consequences of picking a particular license. The purpose of this document is to help\nyou select a software license1 .\nThere are two important things to understand about software licenses before we continue. First of\nall, United States copyright law grants the creators of original works certain rights that are retained\nimplicitly. Specifically, since 1976, copyright is bestowed upon \"works of original authorship fixed in\ntangible media,\" including software. It seems that even the experts are not sure what happens when\nyou try to forfeit these basic rights [14], but the consensus seems to be that it is not possible to explicitly\nand voluntarily place your software in the public domain. One important entity holding the opposite\nview is the Creative Commons2 [2]. Most agree that, if you want your work in the public domain,\nyou should just distribute your software with an extremely permissive license like the MIT License.\nYou are using a license to grant other people the right to use your software under the conditions you\nspecify.\nThe second important thing to understand is that a license grants rights to the recipient, it does\nnot restrict the author of the software. For example, just because you distribute your source code\nunder the GPL [5], this does not mean that you cannot include that code in proprietary software; it\nsimply means that other people cannot. You can change your mind about the license under which you\nwish to distribute your software, but this can be messy. Read this document carefully and make your\ndecision a permanent one.\nThe highest level of our classification hierarchy, and the first thing your should think about when\npicking a license, is whether the source should be open, closed, or some combination thereof.\nIn\nother words, do you want to provide your customers with access to your source code under whatever\nrestrictions are specified in the license? In this paper, we argue that opensource is typically a better\nchoice, and that even proprietary vendors should expose the source for certain key parts of their\nsoftware.\nWe argue that those portions of the code responsible for compatibility and security are\nthe most important ones to expose, and that this will be beneficial both to the vendor and to the\nconsumers.\nTo help you select a license, we have created a license selection engine that can be accessed online\nand is based on our license classification table. The License Selection Engine [12], as we have called\nit, may serve as a guide to help narrow the field of license choices. After that, careful attention should\nbe paid to specific details, and major projects should consult a legal authority.\nThis paper, therefore, presents a taxonomy of both opensource and closedsource software licenses,\nexamines two major licenses in detail, suggests a strategy for opening selected portions of project code\nfor the benefit of everyone involved.\n1As we made clear in the disclaimer, we are not offering legal advice, nor are we qualified to do so. What we are\npresenting here is our own understanding of the universe of software licenses, and our personal opinions on the subject.\nWhile we are not lawyers, we are experienced and welltrained computer scientists. As such, the technical aspects of this\nreport are more reliable than the legal aspects. Before making legal decisions, you should contact a lawyer.\n2Their policy on how to put something in the public domain can be found at:\nhttp://creativecommons.org/license/publicdomaindirect\n\nTAXONOMY\nTaxonomy\nIn this section, we provide a taxonomy of both opensource and proprietary software licenses. The\ntaxonomy analyzes a number of different software licenses and provides a breakdown of their major\nfeatures in a succinct, easytoread format. These features were chosen based on their importance to,\nand the needs of, software developers.\n2.1\nOpenSource Licenses\nAn opensource license facilitates the evolution of software by requiring software covered under the\nlicense to distribute all program files associated with the software. In this section, several opensource\nsoftware licenses were analyzed including: Public Domain, Academic Free License, Common Public\nLicense, Lesser General Public License, Open Software License, Open Software License, General Public\nLicense, Modified BSD License, IBM Public License, Apple Public Source License, as well as the INTEL\nOpen Source License [7]. This list is repeated in Table 2.1. These software licenses were chosen as a\nrepresentative crosssection of the vast number of available opensource licenses. We feel that these\nlicenses should be able to cover the majority of software developed by individual programmers and\nsmall software companies. There are a variety of features that can be measured for each type of license.\nThese range from whether the license text needs to be included upon redistribution to the type other\nsoftware that ones work can be included.\nEach of the chosen licenses were analyzed for a number of features and the results are displayed in\nTables 2.1, 2.1, and 2.1.\nThe following list explains the meanings of the various license features:\n- Copyright notice must be attached? Does the license require users to include the copyright notice\nin all redistribution of the source code?\n- Same license for larger work? Does the license require that all larger software packages containing\nall or part of the source code (including modifications) fall under the said license?\n- Users can modify the code? Are users granted the freedom to modify all or parts of the source\ncode?\n- Users can create derivative works? Does the license grant the user the freedom to modify or use\nthe source code as part of a larger distribution or another software package?\n- Users can ask money for redistribution of the software code, part or whole?Does the license allow\nusers to ask for money when redistributing any part of the source code?\n- GPL compatible? Is the license compatible with the GNU General Public License?\n- User can create binary applications? May the code be compiled into a binary application runnable\nby a computer?\n- Must distribute modified source code? Does this license require users to distribute source code\nfor any modified versions of the software?\n- Copyleft? All users have the right and freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the program's\nsource code or any programs derived from it.

In the following\nsection we analyze several proprietary software licenses. Namely, Microsoft Windows XP, Apple OS X,\nMicrosoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Dreamweaver, Sun Java, and Winzip. These licences\nwere selected because we felt they are representative of a wide variety of proprietary software that is\nin common use. Windows XP and OS X are two common operating systems; Office, Photoshop, and\nDreamweaver are contentediting applications used in many business environments; Java and Winzip\nare two software utilities that are widely distributed.\nFor each of these applications, we analyze several features that we consider the most relevant. We\nexplain each of them in detail below. Tables 2.2.12, 2.2.12, and 2.2.12 summarize the results of our\nanalysis.\n2.2.1\nHardware Permitted\nHardware permitted describes the type of hardware on which you are allowed to run the software. The\nmost common enforcement is to allow the user to install the software on one main computer and on\none laptop computer. The software is to be used by the user only and, if the user gets a new computer,\nhe or she can transfer the software, provided it is removed from the old computer.\nBy far the most restrictive licenses in this case were the OS licenses. Apple specifies that the\ncomputer must be Applelabelled. So that means you can only run the software on a computer bought\nfrom Apple. If you made a clone, you would not be allowed to run the software there. Microsoft's\nlicense limits the number of processors that the computer can have and specifies that the software is to\nbe bundled with a specific computer. That is, if a user gets a new computer, he or she must buy a new\nlicense. The restriction has other implications that are not so clear. When does a computer cease to\nbe the same computer and become a new one? If you install new memory, certainly the answer should\nbe that the computer is the same, but what if you upgrade the processor, or switch the motherboard?\nThe licenses for the software utilities we analyzed were more lenient. Java's license [6] allows the\nsoftware to be used on an unlimited number of computers. However, it is also given for free, so it is only\nlogical that this would be the case. WinZip's [16] license allows the user to install it on an unlimited\nnumber of computers as long as only one person uses the software. Alternatively, the software can be\n\nTAXONOMY\nused by an unlimited number of users as long as it is only installed on one computer.\nOf all the options provided, we felt that WinZip's was the best for commercial proprietary soft\nware. It strikes the right balance between providing flexibility for the user and disallowing unlimited\ndistribution. Both of the choices it provides are very logical: a consumer can buy the software for their\nown personal use and they can use it on whatever computer they want, or the consumer can buy it for\nthe house computer so the whole family can use it.\n2.2.2\nNetwork Use\nBesides restricting the hardware in which the software can be used, companies also restrict how the\nsoftware can be used through a network. Most of them allow network use through an alternative license\noption, in which there is a copy of the software running on a server. The server must have a license;\nas well as every client that accesses the software on the server.\nThe one exception were the operating systems, which do not allow network use. That is, a client\ncomputer cannot run the operating system from a server, it must be locally installed. Because operating\nsystems also provide network services, some companies also place restrictions on the use of those\nservices.\nWindows, for example, only allows a maximum of 10 concurrent connections to use the\nnetwork services provided by the OS. Apple's OS X [8], on the other hand, places no restrictions on\nthe number of connections that may use the network services provided by the OS software.\n2.2.3\nActivation Required\nSome software requires a registration or activation procedure before being fully functional. In most\ncases, this registration is optional. In the licenses we studied, there were two main exceptions: WinZip\nand Microsoft's products.\nWinZip's requirement is understandable. It is only enforced when you have the free version of the\nsoftware, which is intended to be used during a demonstration period. After the demonstration period\nthe user can opt to buy the software and get an activation key that removes all restrictions.\nMicrosoft's case, is different. They require you to register and activate the software after you have\nbought the software and paid for the right to use it. The activation can ask any sorts of questions,\nincluding personally identifiable information. This is, in fact, contradicting other parts of the license\nwhich states that, although you agree Microsoft will collect information from you, it will do so in a\nmanner that is not personally identifiable. We feel this mandatory activation is undesirable as it places\nan additional burden on the customer and raises privacy concerns. If the intended goal is to prevent\nprivacy, there are other means that are effective.\n2.2.4\nBackups Permitted\nAlthough companies generally try to prevent consumers from making copies of the software, they\ngenerally allow making copies for backup purposes. The most common option is to allow customers to\nmake one backup copy as long as the copyright notices are included in the backup.\nMicrosoft Office was more restrictive, and did not allow any backup copies to be made. It considered\nthe original media to be a backup copy, which in our opinion, is a ludicrous statement because it\nprevents users from making backups of updated state in their harddrive. For example, if the user\ninstalls the software, makes changes to the configuration, and installs a new patch, he or she would\nnot be able to make a backup of the resulting state.\nDreamweaver, Java and WinZip were more lenient. Dreamwever allowed for a \"reasonable number\"\nof backup copies to be made. Java and WinZip allowed for an unlimited number of copies. In our\nopinion, all companies should take this approach, and allow the customers to make as many backups as\nnecessary to safeguard their software and data. Especially since, as we explain in the warranty section,\n\nTAXONOMY\ncompanies generally don't make any warranty with respect to the media the software is provided in,\nand if they do, it is generally limited to only 90 days.\n2.2.5\nDerivative Work\nUnlike opensource software, basically all proprietary software prohibits any derivative work from being\ncreated. Specifically, companies generally prohibit, alterations, modifications and any sort of reverse\nengineering, decompilation and dissasembly.\nMost licenses stated this terms in different but similar wording. One license, however, struck us as\npeculiar on the way it phrased the terms. Macromedia [9] stated that the user may not \"reduce the\nSoftware to a human perceivable form\". We believe the intended interpretation is the same as for the\nother software, but under a more lenient interpretation it could even restrict a user from writing about\nhow a program works.\n2.2.6\nProduced Work\nProduced work refers to the restrictions placed on content created to the use of the software. This\nsection does not apply to the operating systems, but applies to the other software we studied.\nSome of the software placed no restriction on the work you could create with it. However, some,\nlike Microsoft Office [10] and Adobe Photoshop [1], placed restrictions on the content that could be\ncreated. Office did not allow for obscene or scandalous material to be created using clipart elements.\nPhotoshop prohibits the use of included stock for pornographic or illegal material.\nIn our opinion, no restrictions should be placed on the work users create using a piece of software.\nUsers should be able to use the software they legally paid for to produce any kind of work they want.\nWhether that work raises legal issues or not, should not be the concern of the software company,\nespecially since they claim no liability whatsoever.\n2.2.7\nResell Policy\nWith most physical products, you are allowed to resell the product to another customer and transfer\nall the accompanying rights. Software companies, however, impose restrictions on how you can resell\nthe software. Many of them, enforce a onetime permanent transfer policy. Which means that only the\noriginal licensee is allowed to resell it; once he does so, the customer that bought the license from him\nis not allowed to resell it - ever. Other companies allow a permanent transfer policy, which basically\nmeans that whoever acquires the resold license, can resell it again if he or she so desires. In both cases,\nthe seller must get rid of all his copies of the software and the buyer must agree to all the terms of the\nlicense.\nIn our opinion, a permanent transfer policy is preferable that the onetime permanent transfer\npolicy. Since it allows indefinite reselling and still guarantees that the license terms are enforced.\n2.2.8\nExport Restrictions\nBecause all the companies that we studied were US based, all of them licensed their software according\nto US export restrictions. Namely, they state that the software may not be exported or reexported (a)\ninto (or to a national or resident of) any U.S. embargoed countries (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,\nNorth Korea, Sudan, and Syria) or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Departments list of Specially\nDesignated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity.\nSoftware made outside the US is not subject to these restrictions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n2.2.9\nWarranty\nSoftware is probably one of the few industries in which no sort of warranties are generally made to\ncustomers. In fact, the only two warranties that are commonly made are a 90 day limited express\nwarranty on the behavior of the software and a 90 day warranty on the media. The first warranties\nthat the software will behave substantially in accordance to the provided user manuals; the second\nwarranties that the media the software is provided in will be free of manufacturing defects for 90 days.\nNo other warranties are made. In fact, the licenses explicitly deny any other warranties, whether\nexpress or implied, to the maximum extent permitted by the law.\n2.2.10\nLiability\nJust like software companies try to avoid making any warranties on software, they similarly avoid\nhaving any liability (for the promises they didn't make). Most software companies limit their liability\nto either the cost of the software license or a prefixed amount specified in the license. This amount\nusually isn't very high; within the licenses we studied the highest amount was $500. Some software\nlike Java [6] and WinZip [16], assumed no liability at all.\nWe want to emphasize that companies limit their liability as much as permitted by the law. They\ndeny being liable, regardless of the cause of damage, regardless of the theory of liability and regardless\nof whether they have been previously advised of such damages. Their proposed monetary remedy is\nalso the maximum they will pay, even if the remedy fails its essential purpose.\nWe feel the position software companies take with respect to liability and warranty, leave an open\nmarket for companies that want to make more promises to their customers. It could even be a third\nparty company that especializes on setting up software and, in a sense, offering \"insurance\" against it\nfailing.\n2.2.11\nJurisdiction\nSince software is sold all around the world, software companies generally make the software users\nagree to a jurisdiction. Any legal issues that arise are to be resolved according to the laws of that\njurisdiction. As expected, all of the software we studied stated as it's jurisdiction the state where the\nsoftware company resided.\n2.2.12\nMiscellaneous\nIn this section we discuss other features that we thought were important, but not generalizable enough\nto apply to all the licenses.\nSee Tables 2.2.12, 2.2.12, and 2.2.12 for more details; the features are selfexplanatory.\nDiscussion\nIn this section, we discuss two major licenses in detail. Specifically, we examine the GPL (GNU Public\nLicense) [5], an extremely popular opensource license, and we examine the Microsoft EULA (EndUser\nLicense Agreement), which is distributed with minor variations along with most of its closedsource\ncommercial software. Following these discussions, we present our own opinion regarding the selection\nof a license. We argue that selectively opening your source code can provide benefits for all parties\ninvolved.\n\nDISCUSSION\nMicrosoft Windows XP\nApple OS X\nHardware\n1 computer with at most 2 processors\n1 Applelabeled computer.\nPermitted\n(bundled).\nNetwork Use\nAt most 10 concurrent connections to\nUnlimited concurrent connections to\nthe services provided by the software.\nthe services provided by the software.\nActivation\nYes, mandatory within 30 days.\nNo, not necessary.\nRequired\nBackups Per\n1 backup copy.\n1 backup with copyright notices.\nmitted\nDerivative\nCannot reverse engineer, decompile or\nCannot reverse engineer, decompile or\nWork\ndisassemble.\ndisassemble.\nResell Policy\nOnetime permanent transfer.\nOnetime permanent transfer.\nExport\nRe\nstrictions\nMust follow US Export restrictions.\nMust follow US Export restrictions.\nWarranty\n90 days limited express warranty.\n90 day limited warranty on media.\nLiability\nLicense Fee or $5, whichever is greater.\n$50\nJurisdiction\nWashington\nCalifornia\nMiscellaneous\nAllows installation of 3rd party soft\nNeed license for nonpersonal MPEG2\nware.\nuse.\nComes bundled with products that re\nquire additional licenses.\nAllows MS to collect data from your\ncomputer in a manner that can't per\nsonally identify you.\nTable 5: Table summarizing the differences and similarities between the proprietary licenses for selected\nOSes.\n\nDISCUSSION\nMicrosoft Office\nAdobe Photoshop\nMacromedia\nDreamweaver\nHardware\n1 main computer and 1\n1 main computer and 1\n1 computer.\nPermitted\nportable computer.\nportable computer.\nNetwork Use\nAlternative\nnetwork\nli\ncense.\nAlternative\nnetwork\nli\ncense.\nAlternative\nnetwork\nli\ncense.\nActivation\nYes, after a finite number\nNo, not necessary.\nNo, not necessary.\nRequired\nof product launches.\nBackups Per\nNone.\nThe\noriginal\nReasonble number.\n1 backup with copyright\nmitted\nmedia is considered the\nnotices.\nbackup.\nProduced\nWork\nCannot\ncreate\nobscene\nor scandalous work with\nprovided media elements.\nCannot\ncreate\nporno\ngraphic or illegal mate\nrial with stock.\nNo restriction.\nDerivative\nCannot reverse engineer,\nCannot reverse engineer,\nCannot reverse engineer,\nWork\ndecompile or disassem\ndecompile or disassem\ndecompile or disassem\nble.\nble.\nble.\nResell Policy\nOnetime\npermanent\ntransfer.\nPermanent transfer.\nPermanent transfer.\nExport\nRe\nMust follow US Export\nMust follow US Export\nMust follow US Export\nstrictions\nrestrictions.\nrestrictions.\nrestrictions.\nWarranty\n90 days limited express\n90 days limited express\n90 days limited express\nwarranty.\nwarranty.\nwarranty. 90 day limited\nwarranty on media.\nLiability\nLicense\nFee\nor\n$5,\nwhichever is greater.\nLicense Fee.\nLicense\nFee\nor\n$500,\nwhichever is greater.\nJurisdiction\nWashington\nCalifornia\nCalifornia\nMiscellaneous\nMacromedia may audit\nyour use of the software\nupon reasonable notice.\nComments\nReverse\nengineering\nclause\nis\ncuriously\nworded;\nit states that\nthe user may not \"reduce\nthe Software to a human\nperceivable form\".\nTable 6: Table summarizing the differences and similarities between the proprietary licenses for selected\napplications.\n\nDISCUSSION\nJava 1.4.1\nWinzip\nHardware\nUnlimited number of computers.\nUnlimited number of computers for one\nPermitted\n(1) person.

Created by Richard Stallman, a member of MIT, under the GNU\nSoftware Project [4], the GPL license was designed to force software licensed under GPL, and any\nprograms built using the source code, to remain \"free\". In essence, GPL allows users the freedom to\nuse, modify, and distribute copies of the original source code. Furthermore, all modified versions of\nthe source code, derivative works, or larger programs containing all or part of the source code must be\nlicensed under GPL and hence remain \"free\". GPL, however, does not restrict the right of the software\ncreator to charge for the distribution of the source code. In general, GPL provides a large array of\nfreedom and protection for the rights of software developers. However, because GPL requires all larger\nsoftware derived or containing parts of source code licensed under GPL to also fall under the GPL\nlicense, it is also one of the most restrictive. Hence, commercial software cannot incorporate source\ncode released under GPL. While this restriction is not necessarily bad, conflicts of licensing can prevent\nsoftware designers from using freely available and opensource code to improve commercial products.\nFurthermore, an opensource software package may not be combined with source code licensed under\nGPL if the software package uses an opensource software license that is not compatible with GPL.\n3.2\nMicrosoft EULA\nIn this section, we discuss in more detail the Microsoft Windows XP software license. We found this\nlicense to be the most restrictive of the ones we studied and many of the restrictions seem to be\nthere only to get more money out of the customers. As the analysis shows, other successful software\ncompanies have less restrictions and still manage to generate a profit and develop quality software\nproducts.\nIn terms of hardware, the license bundles the software with the computer on which it is installed\nand limits the number of processors to two. So a user has to keep buying new licenses for the software\nevery time he or she upgrades to a new machine, or obtain multiple licenses if the computer has\nmore than two processors. This makes Windows considerably more costly as an operating system\nthan the alternatives for users who constantly upgrade their machines or who have specialized parallel\ncomputers. The license also limits connections to network services provided by the operating system.\nThe user is forced to either pay for a more expensive license to allow for more connections, or to obtain\nthird party software that accomplishes the same purpose. Finally, since the license imposes a onetime\npermanent transfer policy, users cannot easily obtain used versions of the software at a better market\nprice. They are forced to go back to Microsoft to buy the software.\nOther negative aspects about the Microsoft license are that it allows third party software to be\ninstalled, requires an activation procedure, and allows Microsoft to collect information from the user.\nThe third party software generally refers to additional software the user wants to run, such as codecs for\nvideo formats. However, since Microsoft makes no warranties, the third party software could potentially\nbe dangerous and open a door for malicious programs to attack. Requiring an activation from the user\nis annoying, intrusive, and forces users to provide information they might not want to share with the\ncompany (such as personally identifiable information like address and email). The license also allows\nMicrosoft to collect information from your computer. This information cannot personally identify the\nuser, but what exactly this means is questionable. There is information that doesn't immediately\nidentify you, but could, with enough research. Since users don't have the code, they have no way of\nverifying what information is being transmitted.\nIn short, we find that the Microsoft license is too restrictive and embodies many of the negative\naspects that we feel should not be present in a proprietary license.\n\nDISCUSSION\n3.3\nHybrid Model\nIn this section, we suggest a novel hybrid licensing model for proprietary software vendors. Under this\nscheme, portions of the source code are offered as part of the software package, while other aspects\nare left closedsource. We argue, in particular, that those parts of the program related to security\nand compatibility should be opensource. This, in conjunction with our numerous editorial remarks\nregarding specific licenses, constitutes the primary creative contribution of this work.\n3.3.1\nWhy Open?\nThere are countless arguments for and against making software opensource. We will not reiterate\nthem here, except to highlight those parts of the debate that are most relevant to our conclusions.\nOne such issue is security. By revealing the source code, some argue, it is possible for hackers\nor malicious entities to discover vulnerabilities and that this presents a security risk. Of course, this\nargument misses the point: security through obscurity doesn't work. Software should not be written\naround the assumption that it is secure so long as the code is not made public. Indeed, such tactics\nare dangerous and foolish, since a source code leak could render all your security measures moot. A\nmuch better tactic is to design your software with actual security measures, using encryption and\nother accepted techniques. These mechanisms do not depend on the source being a secret; quite the\ncontrary, the mechanism is very public. Instead, the security of the system lies in much smaller and\nmore modular \"secrets\" in the form of private keys, passwords, and so on. It is not likely that a single\nleak will cause a major security breach, while this is certainly the case when secrets are hidden in the\nsource code.\nTherefore, by allowing the source code related to security to be made public, many people can\nverify the integrity of your security mechanisms. This will help make your system more secure, and\nwill also instill confidence in your customers by letting them see for themselves that their data will\nbe protected. In our opinion, if a company insists on keeping their source private, claiming that it is\na security risk to release it, then that company has a poor understanding of computer security and\nshould probably be avoided.\nAnother point of contention is compatibility. Proponents of opensource argue that it is easier to\nwrite drivers, plugins, and other extensions when they have access to the source. APIs are useful, but\nare frequently incomplete or lack information related to performance. Exposing the source related to\ncompatibility with hardware and other software allows thirdparty coders the opportunity to extend\nand improve the compatibility of your software.\nThis accomplishes something else in addition to\nincreasing the size of your potential user base, which is that it tends to build a community of people\nwho have contributed to the project in some way. This gives people a sense of ownership and they are\nmore likely to continue using your software in the future.\nAgain, making this portion of your software opensource benefits your customers by increasing\ncompatibility and benefits the vendor by generating a community of contributors.\n3.3.2\nWhy Closed?\nThis raises the question: why not open the entire code base? For many companies, this is a hair\nraising proposition. They may fear that releasing their code will provide people with a disincentive\nto purchase it, because they can get it for free. Or, they may feel that certain portions of their code\ncontain methods or techniques that they do not yet wish to have made public. We respond to these\nconcerns in order.\nAntipiracy schemes will always be broken. Activation keys will be distributed, key generators will\nbe coded through reverse engineering, and disc images will make their rounds. The point of antipiracy\nmeasures is not to prevent piracy, because that would be both impossible and would almost necessarily\n\nLICENSE SELECTION ENGINE\ninconvenience paying customers. Instead, the goal of antipiracy measures is to make it unprofitable\nto pirate. That is, the measures should be costly enough to circumvent that most people won't bother\nto pirate it3 . There will always be people who will make it their mission in life to break socalled\nDRM schemes. But most people aren't malicious, and they aren't thieves. But if they don't feel your\nsoftware is worth the price, they won't buy it. And some of those people, the ones who wouldn't buy\nthe software anyway, will reason that you don't lose any money if they pirate it.\nThe reasoning for keeping a portion of your software proprietary follows from these observations. If\nmost of your code is available, anyway, the amount of profit from breaking open the remainder of the\ncode is decreased! This is especially powerful when the part of your code that is opensource compiles\ninto a functional, though incomplete, system4 . It is worth noting that releasing something without\nsource code can be considered a form of antipiracy measure, in that people assume that it is impossible\nto recover code from a binary. This is a fallacy; it is possible to reverse engineer a good portion of\nthe code functionality given a running program. Decompilers and a good knowledge of programming\ntechniques are often enough to determine how something was coded. After all, binaries are really just\ncode in a humanobfuscated language. This isn't to say that you get a perfect replica of the original\ncode, and the code won't be commented (if it ever was), but if you are trying to hide an algorithm\nor security measure, you will fail. Again, it is a question of efficiency. It is timeconsuming to reverse\nengineer something, and if your software is cheap enough, or enough of it is freely available, the vast\nmajority of people won't find the exercise worthwhile.\nStill, keeping a small portion of the code proprietary will at least discourage the casual user from\nbreaking it apart. That, and the mere fact that companies will have the illusion that something is\nbeing withheld from the customer may appeal to certain companies, thus making this scheme more\nappealing.\n3.3.3\nCompromise\nAll of this suggests a compromise: open a large, functional portion of your code, while keeping a small,\nselect portion proprietary. Opening the security and compatibility portions of your code serves to,\namong other things:\n1. Increase security through independent auditing.\n2. Cultivate a contributing community.\n3. Improve compatibility.\nMeanwhile, keeping a portion of the code closed has an appeal to companies because it:\n1. Discourages casual piracy.\n2. Temporarily obfuscates algorithms or security measures.\n3. Appeals to companies.\nLicense Selection Engine\nAs part of our effort to help the average programmer choose an appropriate license for their software,\nwe have created the License Selection Engine [12] that suggests licenses based upon their responses to\n3Another way to make circumvention unprofitable is, of course, to lower the price of your software. If piracy is rampant,\na smart company will consider this as a possible recourse. The RIAA, for example, hasn't quite figured this out.\n4For example, Apple releases the Darwin OS as free opensource software. It is completely functional, but lacks, among\nother things, the proprietary Aqua GUI. These additional components turn Darwin into Mac OS X.\n\nLICENSE SELECTION ENGINE\na series of questions. Currently, there are a wide variety of licenses available and the choice of license\nfor a particular piece of software can have far reaching consequences for the amount of compensation or\nrecognition that a programmer or firm can receive for producing a particular piece of software. Since\nmost small software companies or individual programmers are not skilled in the complex legal matters\nsurrounding software licenses, we have attempted to aid in the choice of a license by providing a variety\nof suggestions and pointers towards more detailed information about each license once a suggestion\nhas been made.\nThe License Selection Engine is available in a webbased format and covers a wide variety of licenses\nranging from propriety Microsoft EULA [11] to the GNU public license [4]. The programmer enters\nthe website and is presented with a series of questions determining the broad category of license that\nis appropriate; this is shown in Figure 1. This involves asking whether the software is open source\nand whether the programmer plans to charge for the program. As Figure 2 illustrates, once the broad\ncategory is established, more detailed questions are asked about the types of rights that the programmer\nwants to hold over the software, and the list of possible licenses is narrowed. At the end of answering\naround 10 questions, the license selection engine compares the survey results with a matrix of licenses\nand their properties and makes a suggestion based upon this correlation. See Figure 3 for an example.\nBecause of the breadth of licenses available, there are licenses that cover almost every possible survey\nresponse.\nIn Section 2, we gave tables showing the various rights provided by each licence.\nThe license\nselection engine consults these tables after accumulating the results of the survey in order to suggest\nan appropriate license.\n4.1\nTechnical Details\nThe License Selection Engine is implemented using a perl script that can run on any web server that\nsupports perl extensions. The questions and matrix for licenses are stored in text files that can easily\nbe modified by a user. The web server used to run the engine in this case is a standard Red Hat\nLinux box that is running Apache 2.0 and Perl 5. The data that is used to run the engine is stored\ninto separate database files. These are essentially text files that are in a humanreadable format for\neasy editing by a user who wishes to extend the system. There is one file, questions.txt, which\ncontains the questions to ask the user and which actions to perform if a given question is answered\npositively. For example, on the first page the question about open versus closed source contains a\npointer to the appropriate next page of questions. The other file, called licenses.txt, contains each\nlicense covered by the License Selection Engine, along with a short description, and the matrix entry\nof how a respondent should answer the questions in order to have the particular license selected. The\nmodularity of the system allows the engine to be easily updated to take advantage of new licenses or\nmake modifications to reflect changes in the wording of existing licenses.\n4.2\nRelated Work\nThere are more primitive versions of the License Selection Engine on the web [13, 14], but most cover\nfew licenses and we have found none that covers both open and closed source programs. Also, given the\nextendable nature of the License Selection Engine, we anticipate that the number of licenses covered by\nour system can grow indefinitely. The ultimate in license selection would be able to generate a perfect\ncustom license on the fly, in a similar way to how the Creative Commons [2] site generates license for\nvarious types of electronic media. This a more difficult task for software licenses since there are a very\nlarge number of rights that can be applied in a variety of different situations.\n\nLICENSE SELECTION ENGINE\nFigure 1: The first few questions determine the broad category of license that will be used.\n\nLICENSE SELECTION ENGINE\nFigure 2: More in depth questions allow the system to narrow down the field of possible licenses.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS\nFigure 3: In this case, the License Selection Engine has found one license (the academic free license).\nYou can click the link to find out more information about the license and the text that should be\nincluded with the software.\nContributions\nThis paper has made the following contributions:\n1. Presented taxonomy of software licenses, both open and closedsource.\n2. Examined two major licenses in detail.\n3. Implemented a software License Selection Engine.\n4. Argued in favor of partially opening source code in the context of proprietary software.\nIn particular, it is worth noting the original, creative contributions of this work. We have presented a\nmore complete taxonomy than has ever before been attempted, and provided a License Selection Engine\nto present this material in an intuitive and useful way. We provided our own opinions regarding what\nlicenses are worthwhile, and which we feel are largely flawed.\nFinally, and most importantly, we\ndiscussed a unique hybrid licensing model of our own design.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Professor Robert Rines and Ethel Machi for their invaluable instruction and\ninput.\n\nREFERENCES\nReferences\n[1] Licensing.

      "content": "Improving Upon the Current Patent System\nCLIFF ROSCOW\nMITUN RANKA\nSEDRICK TYDUS\nIntroduction\nFrom an economic perspective, the current patent system is flawed. The purpose\nof the patent system should be to give the inventor a reward proportional to the amount\nthat his invention adds to society. By this measure, the current patent system has several\nflaws.\nDefenders of the current system of granting intellectual property rights to\ninventors cite both moral and economic analysis to defend their position.1 From an\neconomic perspective, some economists (most notably John Stuart Mill) supported\nintellectual property protection because it allows the market to naturally price the value\nof the invention. Unfortunately, the current patent system has several flaws.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nThe biggest problem with giving any party exclusive rights to the use of an idea is\nthat it naturally encourages economic inefficiency in the form of monopoly. If the patent\nprotects the production of a certain product, the inventor can control the pricing of that\nproduct. Since nobody else is allowed to manufacture the product, the inventor can set the\nprice of his good without worrying about being undercut by a competitor. This leads to a\n1 John Stuart Mill, Principals of Political Economy with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy\n(1872)\n\nprice that is determined in too great a capacity by demand instead of production costs.\nThe unfortunate side effect of this is that consumers who would otherwise benefit by the\nconsumption of the product can become priced out of the market. The producer gains\nfrom this optimal pricing system, but all of his gains come from a direct loss to\nconsumers. If the idea being patented is a production process, a similar inefficiency\nresults.2 A superior production process should lead to increased output or decreased unit\nproduction costs. In a competitive market, this should lead to a price reduction across the\nboard in manufacturers of that product. However, when only one producer has access to\nthe technology, the producer is able to make more profit while the market fails to provide\nan efficient level of the product.\nThe other unfortunate consequence of the current system is the encouragement of\ndefensive patents. Corporations use this type of patent as a strategic competitive weapon.\nThe idea of a defensive patent is that a company might patent an idea that it has no\nintention of utilizing in order to prevent an opponent from using the idea.3 An example\nmight be a manufacturing process that could reduce the opponent's manufacturing costs.\nA lower marginal cost for the opponent leads to lower market prices and thus a declining\nprofit for the original company. The net effect of this patent should be obvious, however.\nBy preventing the competitor from using the manufacturing process, the company not\nonly reduces that company's profit margin, it reduces consumer surplus for the users of\nthe product.\n2 Davis, Lee N. Should We Consider Alternative Incentives for Basic Research? Patents Vs. Prizes;\nDepartment of Industrial Economics and Strategy- Copenhagen Business School\n3 John H. Barton, Reforming the Patent System, Science Vol 287, Number 5460, 1933-1934; March 17,\n\nAnother problem with the current process is that is produces a pricing structure\nthat can be misunderstood by the average consumer. Since politicians often base their\ndecisions on the understanding of the average consumer, this type of misunderstanding\nbecomes a problem. An example of this is the misunderstanding of the reimportation of\ndrugs in the United States.4 The idea of reimportation of drugs back into the United States\nhas been a argued heatedly in both public and political arenas. This topic affects a wide\nvariety people because there are so many different issues to address. The elderly are\naffected because it is them who predominately need these drugs. The drug industry is\ninfluenced by this subject because they are the ones who have to cover the costs of the\nreimportation. Ultimately, this is an issue about healthcare and money so American\nsociety as a whole is affected as well.\nSpecifically, the reimportation of drugs concerns the sale of drugs, initially\nproduced to be sold at lower prices in another country, in America. They can be brought\nback into the U.S. and sold for a cheaper price than the American equivalent. For\nexample, Pfizer may sell Lipitor in the United States for twenty dollars, while they offer I\nfor sale in Mexico for five dollars. Reimportation of drugs is the idea that someone can\nbuy Lipitor in Mexico and then bring it back into the United States and sell it for ten\ndollars.\nReimportation occurs because of differences in cost of living. Drug companies\nunderstand that people in the United States make more money than people in India. If the\ncompany tries to sell their drug to India for the price that the United States pays, then\npeople in the poorer country would not buy it. Thus, the company would lose the market.\nMeier, Conrad. Drug Reimportation Bill Called 'Risky'. Health Care News:\nHeartland Institute. September 2003.\n\nIn order to avoid this from happening, the company decides to charge less money to the\npoorer country in order to make some profit. And because the price difference is so\ndrastic in some areas, people are able to buy drugs in the poorer country and then\ntransport them into the United States and offer them at a discount to the American price.\nAt first glance, one may assume that reimportation should not be a problem. It\nseems that everyone wins. This is true only to a certain extent; people in the United\nStates do get their drugs for a lower price then what they would be paying. Seems like a\nwonderful plan that should be implemented. Well, not exactly. The consumer does win\ncurrently, but only at the expense of the large drug companies. These companies are\nlosing money because now they cannot sell their drug at the normal price. Those in favor\nof drug reimportation widely believe that the drug companies have more than enough\nmoney to support themselves. However, with a cheap alternative available to U.S.\nconsumers, the drug companies are unable to sell the drugs produced for the U.S. and as a\nresult their profits suffer. Declining profits mean that ultimately, the companies will have\nto cut costs. The highest cost that a drug company endures is research and development.\nFor a single drug, a company spends around $500M in research. If R&D costs were cut,\nthe advancements of medicine will be hurt. What seems like a good idea in the short run,\nhas clear negative implications in the long run.\nCurrently, the reimportation of drugs is illegal in the United States. The problem,\nhowever, lies in the types of citizens who are breaking the law. The people most guilty\nof buying reimported drugs are the elderly, the poor and the terminally ill. There are few\npolitical leaders and law officials who want to condemn this group of citizens. Even\nthough it is understood that in the long term, this will have large detrimental effects on\n\nour health as well as our economy, leaders are hesitant to stand up against the drug\nreimportation.\nReimportation of drugs is a topic that will continue to be argued until Congress is\nable to come to a solution that is mutually beneficial to all parties involved. They must\nfind a way to balance the needs those who are rely on these drugs with the needs of the\npharmaceutical companies without mortgaging our future for health and safety. We\npropose a new system that can address many of the problems with the current patent\nsystem, including the complex issue of drug reimportation.\nReward System and Optional Reward System\nOne of the alternatives to awarding absolute control over the production of new\nproducts to the inventor that has been proposed is a reward system.5 Is it possible for the\nrewards system to be Pareto superior6 to the existing patent system? As long as the new\nsystem provides a level of reward that is equal to or greater than the value of intellectual\nproperty rights, without sacrificing economic efficiency, we can conclude that the system\nis the socially optimal means for rewarding innovation. In fact, this constraint can be\nloosened. All that is needed to make the new system socially optimal is an improvement\nin inventors' motivation to create with no additional loss in efficiency.\nIn their paper published in The Journal of Law and Economics,7 Steven Shavell\nand Tanguy Van Ypersele produce an analytical theory-based comparison of such a\nsystem against the intellectual property system. They note that granting intellectual\n5 Kremer, Michael; Patent Buyouts: A Mechanism for Encouraging Innovation. The Quarterly Journal of\nEconomics, November 1998\n6 Pareto, Vilfredo\n7 Shavell, Steven & Van Yperselle, Tanguy, Rewards vs. Intellectual Property Rights; The Journal of Law\nand Economics, vol. XLIV (October 2001)\n\nproperty rights promotes monopolistic pricing. They also note the drawback of a reward\nsystem, which is an inefficient correlation with demand for a product and reward level.\nThey propose an \"optional reward system,\" where an innovator may choose between a\npatent and a reward. The inventor would be more likely to choose patent for products\nwith very inelastic demand curves. Such products are more common in the\npharmaceutical industry, for example. In an efficient market, drugs are very cheap\nregardless of how highly demanded they are. This is because the manufacture of pills is\nvery inexpensive. Once the patent on a drug has run out, competition drives the price of\nthe pills down to the marginal cost of production. However, if there is only one producer\nof the drug, the producer can charge a price as high as the market can bear. This leads to\nhigh profits for the producer. Conversely, an inventor will choose reward for products\nwith an elastic demand curve. This might be the case for a new type of television screen.\nThe reward will be higher than the profit the innovator could obtain through intellectual\nproperty rights because the control he has over pricing is not as valuable with the\ntelevision screens. He would prefer to let competitors produce his product and accept a\nreward based on total sales, since sales will be relatively high in equilibrium.\nTheir optional reward system is indeed Pareto superior to the current patent\nsystem. The reason for this, according to the authors, is that when the inventor chooses\nthe reward, he is choosing a system with higher economic efficiency. When he chooses a\npatent, there is no change in welfare. In either case, the innovator is at least as well off as\nunder the old system. Thus, there is at least as much encouragement for innovation.\n\nOur analysis questions their results. We then show that careful market analysis\ncan help provide an innovator with an appropriate reward, regardless of the shape of the\ndemand curve for his product. While completely eliminating intellectual property rights\nwould not be Pareto optimal, we argue that the complete implementation of rewards for\ninventions would be socially optimal.\nModel\nThe work done by Shavelle and Van Ypersele holds under the assumptions made\nby classical economic theory. However, they also make the assumption that raising\nmoney for the reward system is costless. We know that this is not the case: a government\ncannot raise money in an economically efficient way. Raising money through taxes\nproduces a deadweight loss for society. The theory can still be shown to hold if it can be\nshown that the net loss resulting from taxation is less than the loss associated with\nmonopoly pricing. However, the authors' claim that market efficiency increases when the\ninnovator chooses reward can be disputed.\nLet's suppose, for example, that the government budget is explained entirely by\nregulation of the good in question. That is, all government income and spending comes\nfrom the system involving the patented good. If this is the case, the government will need\nto levy a tax on the product if it intends to provide an award to the innovator. In order to\ncompensate the inventor by an amount at least as great as what he would receive had he\nbeen given property rights, the government will need to raise that amount of money\nthrough taxes. The profitability of intellectual property rights is described mathematically\nby the following term:\n\nQ M\nQ M\nQ M\n( )\n[\nq\nD ) -\nq\nS )]dq -\n[\nq\nD ) -\np\nD )]dq -\n[ c\nS ) - q\nS )]dq\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n(\n∫\n∫\n∫\nwhere D(q) is the demand curve for the product, S(q) is the supply curve, p is the\nmonopoly price, QM is the monopoly quantity, and c is the marginal cost of production at\nq = QM. This term represents the amount of money the government must raise to\nadequately compensate the innovator. The government revenue generated by taxes is\ndescribed as follows:\n( )[\n(\n( )\np\np\nD\n-\nq\nS )]\nIn order for the government to raise a sufficient amount of money to pay the inventor, (1)\nmust be equal to (2), which is true when S(q) = c. This leads to a deadweight loss of\nQE\n( ) [\nq\nD ) -\nq\nS )]dq\n(\n(\n3 ∫\nQM\nThis social loss is exactly the same as the loss in efficiency incurred through monopoly\npricing. So, with perfect information, an inventor should be indifferent to choosing\nreward or patent, and Shevelle and Van Ypersele's reward system provides no change in\nsocial welfare.\n\nHowever, if we extend the model to allow the inventor to have specific\nknowledge about the market for his product, (a reasonable assumption) the optional\nreward system runs into problems. In this case, the rational innovator will only exercise\nhis option to choose a reward when it is higher than the profit he would make under the\nmonopoly production of the product. This will be the case when the government\noverestimated the reward offered to the inventor. To fund the reward, the government\nwould have to increase taxes above the theoretical level of equation (2). This tax increase\nfurther drives the market into disequilibrium, increasing the deadweight loss above the\nmonopoly level of equation (3). Clearly, if the innovator chooses to exercise his option to\nreceive an award, social welfare will no doubt be reduced. This is in direct opposition to\nthe idea that welfare is improved when the innovator chooses reward instead of patent.\nTherefore, our model becomes strictly more inefficient under the optional reward system.\nHowever, realistic changes can be made to our model that would result in the\nopposite conclusion. Our model can be made more realistic (and complicated) by\nassuming that the government is bigger and controls many sectors of a global economy.\nIf this is the case, one can make an argument that an inefficiency in another sector can be\ntolerated to provide efficiency in the patent reward system. Perhaps the government is\nable to levy taxes more efficiently in another market or otherwise increase revenue. An\noptimal tariff is one theoretical to raise money effectively. If this is possible, the\nstatements made by Shevelle and Van Ypersele remain true. Clearly though, it is feasible\nthat giving inventors the option of accepting a reward can cause efficiency problems.\n\nTherefore, it is our conclusion that the current patent system for rewarding\ninnovation can be improved upon. The implementation of a reward system would be\noptimal to granting all inventors intellectual property rights.\nProposed System\nAny reward system discussed will produce economic inefficiencies.8 The reward\nsystem has the potential to be much better for social welfare. An ideal reward system\nwould come in the form of a per-unit grant. The flaws in this system have been\nelaborated upon and addressed in the earlier sections of this paper. The pros are that the\ngovernment would be able to choose a reward level commensurate with the social\nrelevance of the patent and choose a reward level to maximize social welfare. The reward\nsystem would need to be flexible, and it must be adjusted based on the shape of the\ndemand curve for the patented product. Special attention would need to be paid to high\nimpact, low marginal production cost inventions. If evaluated correctly, this system not\nonly improves the efficiency of the market for the good, it will actually provide a more\naccurate incentive for innovation than the current patent system. For example, the reward\nfor the discovery for a cure for HIV should be higher than almost any other invention\nbecause of the extremely high consumer surplus of the consumers on the far left of the\ndemand curve. A flat reward system would not provide a high enough incentive to cure\nHIV, while the current patent system would lead to ridiculously high prices that\neliminates some consumers form the market. A flexible rewards system would be\nsuperior to either proposed system in both arenas.\n8 Levin, Jonathan & Levin, Richard; Patent Oppositions, Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\n\nIn addition, a flexible rewards system would reduce the pursuit of defensive\npatents. Under the reward system, the payout would be determined by how much the\npatent is used. If the patent is not to be used at all, the holder will not receive a reward.\nAnd since the holder will not have exclusive property rights, he will have no incentive to\napply for the patent unless he intends on using it himself or a competitor intends on using\nthe idea. The holder will get paid when the competitor uses the idea, but in most cases,\nthe idea will still be practically applied. In addition, the idea will be able to be expanded\non and further innovation will not be discouraged. The new system would not eliminate\ndefensive patents altogether, because it would still be profitable for companies to patent\nideas they think might be used later, but it would enable people to be able to use these\nideas.\nFinally, under a flexible rewards system, we would see a little bit less influence\nfrom politics, which can corrupt even the most well designed government structure. On\nthe topic of the reimportation of drugs, the new system would provide the best solution\npossible: cheaper drugs as well as consistent incentive for drug manufacturers to\ninnovate.\nConclusion\nIn the past two decades the United States has seen many changes in its patent\npolicy. These changes and reforms were instituted in an attempt to strengthen and extend\nthe protection that a patent provides to an inventor. In analyzing the recent patent\nreforms, we can classify them in three groups. First, there have been reforms designed to\nprovide patent protection to new types of inventions. In the early 1980s there were a\nseries of Supreme Court rulings that allowed genetically engineered bacteria and software\n\nto be patented. Additionally, in State Street Bank & Trust v. Signature Financial Group\n(1998), a federal circuit court ruled that both business methods and financial service\nproducts were patentable. Second, we have witnessed reforms that increase the power\npatent holders have in infringement lawsuits. In 1982 Congress passed the Federal Courts\nImprovements Act which created the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).\nAll appeals from the many district courts of all patent cases are now assigned to this\ncourt. The idea behind the creation of the CFAC was to eliminate the incentive for patent\ninfringers to seek out specific courts that could be described as being traditionally\nunsympathetic to patentees. As a result there have been noticeable increases in the\nnumber of rulings upheld in favor of patent holders. Third, the length of a patent was\nincreased. Instead of lasting 17 years from the date of issuance, patents now have a term\nof 20 years from the date of application.\nThe result of the many patent reforms that we have witnessed in recent years has\nbeen a positive one. New patent applications rose from around 60,000 per year in the 80s\nto around 150,000 per year in the late 90s. In the Constitution, Congress is empowered to\n\"promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to Authors\nand Inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries,\" and the\npatent reforms have certainly helped do this more effectively. What we have proposed in\nthis paper is that, instead of taking a narrow minded approach and promoting invention\nby benefiting the inventor, we should attempt to reward the inventor while also\nconsidering social welfare. We believe that Congress should promote the progress of\nscience and the useful arts by providing to authors and inventors a reward proportional to\nthe benefits that society receives from their respective writings and discoveries."

      "content": "Copyright Infringement due to Online File\nSharing\n6.901 Inventions and Patents\nGabriel Alatorre\nChristina Huang\nEthan Rigel\n\nIntroduction\nFile sharing has become one of the most prevalent on-line activities. Napster, the original\nmusic sharing service founded in 1999, revolutionized file sharing by allowing the free\nflow of MP3 formatted songs through its user friendly interface. Obtaining music and\nother files became easily accessible, extremely convenient and, most importantly, free.\nConsequently, Napster and similar tools appealed to the masses, especially the youth,\nthus fueling the file sharing boom of the current decade. Peer to peer (P2P) downloads\nare on the rise, especially amongst teenagers. A study conducted by Juniper Research\nfound that 34% of the 15-24 age group admitted to sharing music online without paying\nfor it. Additionally, consumers are three times more likely to opt for the illegal\ndownloads instead of paid ones.1 A 2002 Cornell study showed that over half of the\nschool's bandwidth was dedicated to users of Kazaa, another popular file sharing\napplication.2 Fastrack, the most popular network averages 2.54 millions users daily.3\nAccording to Webnoize, the top four file-sharing systems-- Fastrack, Audiogalaxy,\niMesh, and Gnutella-- were used to download 3.05 billion files during August, 2001.4\nThe magnitude of the file sharing problem is large and continues to increase in scope.\nAttempted solutions to date have been ineffective and potentially inherently unfair in\nterms of distribution of settlement proceeds. A better solution needs to be developed that\ncan solve the myriad of problems associated with this issue.\n\nMoral Issue: Is File Sharing Thievery?\nFile sharing is becoming easier and faster and end users are benefiting with the\naccumulation of free music downloads. However what are the implications for the\nvictims this problem, the music industry? With more than 230 million copies of Kazaa\ndownloaded worldwide, file sharing distributes mass quantities of copyrighted material\nand, therefore, qualifies as an infringement on private property. Copyright owners argue\nthat file-sharing is essentially piracy; end users are obtaining files that they did not pay\nfor.\nAlthough illegal, people are still willing to violate copyright laws for the\nconvenience and benefit of free music as this behavior is not even viewed as immoral by\nmost people. A Gallup poll conducted in August of 2003 showed that only 18 percent of\n13- to 17-year-olds considered cheating on a test morally acceptable. However, 83\npercent of those same teens did not have a problem with downloading free music.5\nEconomic Issue: Is File Sharing Significantly Impacting on Music Sales?\nOn behalf of the music industry, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),\nrepresenting big labels like AOL Time Warner's Warner Music and Vivendi Universal's\nUniversal Music Group among others, is spearheading the efforts to eliminate illegal file-\nsharing worldwide. The RIAA has sued approximately 13,000 people in the United\nStates suspected of sharing copyrighted material. The RIAA believes that the distribution\nof music over the Internet not only affects the profits of the music industry, but is also\ndetrimental to the careers of artists due to the lackluster sales of records. Many argue that\nthe quantity of quality music is declining because of the hostile music environment that\nsoftware piracy has carved out.\n\nWithout doubt, P2P networks have opened the floodgates for file-sharing. However, one\nmust ask what are the real economic costs associated with the exchange of free music?\nEnd users can substitute free downloaded music for legitimate purchases of records, thus\nreducing music sales. The RIAA contends that each download by a pirate represents a\nlost legitimate sale. To support this, the RIAA reported a 10.3 percent and a 7 percent\ndrop in total US music shipments in 2001 to 2002 respectively. In addition, this trend is\nnot limited to the US. According to the IFPI, an organization representing the recording\nindustry worldwide, global music sales are down for the fourth consecutive year, and\nwere down 7 percent in 2003.\nHowever, the above views are no universally held. On the contrary, a study done at\nHarvard and the University of North Carolina uncovered that \"downloads have an effect\non sales which is statistically indistinguishable from zero.\" In 2002, the researchers\ntracked music downloads for a span of 17 weeks, matching data on file transfers with\nactual market performance of the songs and albums being downloaded. They noted that\nfile sharing has only had a limited affect on record sales. While downloads occur on a\nvast scale, they concluded that most users are individuals who may not have bought the\nmusic even in the absence of file sharing.\"6\nMoreover, looking at the most recent data from RIAA's own sales statistics it can be seen\nthat the RIAA's stance is misleading. While it is true that for the first half of 2005 retail\nsales fell by $266.1M (5.3%), this does not take into account digital music sales (such as\n\niTunes) which have increased by $124.5M (169.9%) compared to the same period last\nyear, However, when this is taken into account, the loss is almost halved.7\nArtists' views of File Sharing\nMusic artists, in general, oppose illegal file sharing. Artists of every style and genre,\nincluding Madonna, Elton John, Sheryl Crow, Jay Z, Lenny Kravitz among others, are\nhave spoken out against illegal copying.8 Metallica filed a lawsuit against Napster in\n2000 after discovering the circulation of the \"I Disappear\" demo. Although Metallica\nlost the battle, the case had some significant consequences. It was one of the first steps in\nbreaking the emerging file sharing business. Over 300,000 Napster users were banned\nfrom the service for sharing Metallica MP3s. Other artists like Dr. Dre, Eminem and\nMadonna joined the battle against Napster.\nAlternatively, many recording artists are proponents of file sharing. In some cases, file\nsharing can actually stimulate sales by uncovering new talent. The better than expected\nsales of Radiohead's album Kid A can be attributed to the premature release or \"leakage\"\nof the tracks on Napster. A study conducted by the Pew Internet & American Life\nProject surveyed 3,000 musicians and songwriters about their views about file sharing.\nSurprisingly, they found that 35% of the subjects agreed that file sharing was not\nnecessarily bad because it helped market and distribute the artist's work and twenty three\npercent agreed that file sharing was harmful. When asked about the effect on their\ncareer, 37% were indifferent and 35% report that free downloading has actually boosted\ntheir reputation.9\n\nBasis of suits\nThe lawsuits filed cite violations in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998\n(DMCA). This copyright law implements the World Intellectual Property Organization's\n(WIPO) treaties on copyrights in digital media along with updating US copyright law to\nallow for the protection works from digital infringement as well as adding civil and\ncriminal penalties for violating copyrights through it.10 The DMCA also provides\nprotection against the circumvention of the technical protections used by US copyright\nowners to protect their works (such as encryptions to prevent cd copying).11\nIt appears that the overall goal is for the RIAA to use both preventative and punitive\nlawsuits to keep individuals from being able to access and download illegal materials.\nThe majority of lawsuits filed in file sharing cases fall into two classes.\nThe first group of suits consists of the RIAA targeting institutions and companies that\nallow for file sharing. The defendants in these lawsuits range from universities to\ninternet service providers. It appears that these lawsuits, which are often contested and\nhence more expensive, allow for the recording companies to gain the information needed\ntarget individuals through their settlements. A good example of this is the MIT case\ndiscussed later in this paper.\nThe second class of lawsuits target individual file sharers (so-called \"John Doe\"\nlawsuits). These are lawsuits filled by recording companies using information that the\n\nRIAA has subpoenaed from universities and ISPs to target individuals. As of November\n2004 the RIAA had sued over 15,000 individual users of file sharing services12 with\nalmost 700 new suits being filed each month.13\nThese lawsuits are extremely inexpensive for the recording companies to pursue. Since\nthey already posses the information needed to sue, it takes very little time (and money) to\nprosecute these individuals. In addition, since the DMCA provides for extremely steep\npenalties for copyright infringement (up to $500,000 for the first offense and $1.000,000\nfor subsequent offenses in addition to jail time),14 the amounts sought by recording labels\ncan be astronomical.\nMoreover, since the majority of those sued under P2P usage lawsuits are not piracy\nprofessionals but young people who simply do not want to pay for music, defendants in\nthese lawsuits usually do not possess the resources to fight these charges. Therefore, they\noften end up settling for several thousand dollars.15 For example, in a sample recording\nindustry letter threatening a lawsuit obtained from a pro-P2P interest group, the lawyer\nstates that they will seek minimum damages of $750 per song.16 While most users are\nbeing sued for several songs this can quickly add up to much more then the user is\ncapable of paying and settlement becomes the only real option.\nIn addition, lawsuits that end in settlement are extremely inexpensive for the plaintiffs to\npursue. It costs them very little in terms of attorney time to pursue these suits given that\nthe majority of these claims are settled quickly out of court. For example, in May 2004\n\nthe RIAA sued 493 individuals and by the 25th of that month 486 of the defendants had\nalready settled.17\nLitigation\nSince the late 1990's when sharing music over the Internet became popular, the recording\nindustry (RIAA) has been busy taking software companies as well as individuals to court\nfor copyright infringement. Although some music artists who own the copyrights to their\nmusic such as Andre Young (also known as Dr. Dre) and the music group Metallica18\nhave participated in suing software companies in the past, the recording industry for the\nmost part has carried out and continues to carry out these lawsuits since they generally\nown their artists' copyrights.\nSince the introduction of online file-sharing, it has not been particularly clear as to who is\ndirectly responsible for copyright infringement done through the use of file-sharing\nprograms. The three discernable groups are Internet service providers (ISPs), file-sharing\nsoftware creators, and actual users of these file-sharing programs. Internet service\nproviders give users the ability to share files over the Internet, software companies\nprovide software that makes file-sharing easier, and individuals are the ones who actually\nshare files but are able to because of ISP's and file-sharing software.\nEven before file-sharing programs became popular, ISPs pressured the government to\npass litigation for protection from copyright infringement lawsuits resulting from the\nactions of their subscribers. This led to the passing of the Digital Millennium Copyright\n\nAct (DMCA) in 1998 that states ISPs cannot be held accountable for transmitting\ncopyrighted material.19 Because of the DMCA, the recording industry has focused their\nefforts to stop online music piracy by suing software companies and individuals caught\nsharing music over the Internet.\nThe recording industry first began its lawsuit frenzy by targeting software companies that\nmade it possible for its users to share music files online. It seemed logical that if these\ncompanies were shut down and their programs removed from the Internet then online\nmusic piracy would not be so prevalent. Also, filing lawsuits against a few software\ncompanies instead of the millions of individuals who used them seemed to be a more\nefficient alternative.\nThe first major lawsuit was the RIAA v. Napster case filed in December of 1999 where\nthe recording industry alleged Napster was committing copyright infringement.20 This\nunprecedented lawsuit brought to surface all sorts of questions as to how copyright law is\napplied to the Internet. By looking at the details of how Napster operated it was not clear\nat first whether they were infringing or not. If it were the case that Napster had servers\ncontaining all these copyrighted music files which it shared to anyone using their\nsoftware over the Internet then it is clear that they were without a doubt infringing. In\nthis case Napster physically had copyrighted music which it was distributing without\ncompensating the artists. Unfortunately, Napster did not operate in this manner and what\ncomplicated the case was that Napster did not physically hold the music files being\ndistributed. Napster users themselves had the music files and Napster's software simply\n\nconnected its users to other users.21 Napster gave users the ability to commit\ninfringement but it was really up to the user whether they did it or not. In this respect, a\nsimilar case took place in 1984 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of\nBetamax.22 In that case, Hollywood tried to stop the distribution of Sony's VCR. The\nVCR enabled its users to tape television programs illegally but, again, its users were\nresponsible for whether they did it or not.\nThe creators of Napster thought they had circumvented copyright law by not holding the\nmusic files themselves, which is essentially true. In addition, to cover themselves they\nincluded copyright protection documentation with their software that warned users not to\nuse their software for copyright infringing purposes and that any users caught would have\ntheir membership revoked.23 It seemed that Napster abided by all legal statutes but on\nfurther inspection on how Napster operated proved otherwise. Instead of storing files\nNapster kept a server that contained a list of all its users and the files they contained.24\nSince Napster was able to see which of its users were sharing copyrighted music and did\nlittle about it they were found guilty of copyright infringement. Copyright law states that\nif someone is knowingly aiding in copyright infringement then they are just as guilty as\nindividuals doing the actual copying and/or distribution.25 In the end, Napster settled\nnumerous lawsuits resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. They filed for bankruptcy\nin 2002 and sold what remained of their company to Bertelsmann AG.26\nWhile the recording industry was suing Napster they also filed a lawsuit against\nAudiogalaxy, another Napster-like software company that enabled online file-sharing.\n\nOnce Napster was successfully sued, Audiogalaxy quickly opted to settle. Audiogalaxy\nhad tried to implement search filters that did not return the location of copyrighted\nmaterial but the filters were deemed to not be good enough by the RIAA and National\nMusic Publishing Association (NMPA).27 Audiogalaxy settled its lawsuits losing\nmillions of dollars, just like Napster, and removed most of its files for download.\nThe software company Kazaa succeeded Napster but in order to avoid being sued in U.S.\ncourts they operate outside of the United States. They have their headquarters in\nAustralia and based their operations in the island nation of Vanuatu.28 The recording\nindustry in the United States has not been able to successfully shut down Kazaa although\na lawsuit in Los Angeles is still pending. The Australian Record Industry Association\n(ARIA), on the other hand, has taken steps to stop Kazaa. In September 2005, an\nAustralian court ruled that Kazaa was not itself responsible for copyright infringement\nbut in order to continue their operations in Australia they had to find a way to stop the\ndistribution of copyrighted material. Kazaa did not comply so people in Australia are\nnow unable to use Kazaa. In response, Kazaa moved itself to Amsterdam where it still\ncontinues to operate.29\nThe latest court decision that has had a major impact in the area of online file-sharing\noccurred June of this year. In the case of MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, the U.S.\nSupreme Court held Grokster responsible for copyright infringement.30 This case was\nunlike the Napster case because Grokster's servers kept only a list of users instead of a\nlist of users and the files they had. When searching for a file a user was connected to\n\nother users and if they did not have the file they were looking for then they just searched\nthe files of other users. By implementing file-sharing this way, Grokster could not tell\nwhether their users were distributing copyrighted material so they were not responsible.\nSimilar to companies that create VCRs, Grokster provides technology that could be used\nto illegally copy material but it is up to the user whether they choose to do so or not.\nBecause of this logic Grokster had won two previous court decisions.31\nThe recording industry backed MGM Studios whereas corporations like Intel, Yahoo, and\nMicrosoft backed Grokster. In the minds of tech companies, a court decision against\nGrokster would create a precedent and discourage the creation of Internet technology.\n(which could be viewed as the type of technology the U.S. Constitution states that the\ngovernment should promote and protect). Grokster losing also meant questioning the\nlegality of technology such as CD and DVD burners, IPods, and VCRs as well as copy\nmachines.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court found Grokster guilty of copyright infringement since they\nbelieved Grokster promoted its product to be used for copyright infringement purposes\nand that there is evidence showing that Grokster's software was primarily used for the\npurpose of illegally distributing material over the Internet. On ruling against Grokster,\nJustice Souter stated, \"We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of\npromoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by the clear expression or other\naffirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of\ninfringement by third parties.\"32\n\nThe court decision led to Grokster shutting down and has created a precedent to be used\nin future cases involving Internet technology that can possibly be employed for copyright\ninfringement suits. This decision has also resulted in other software companies that\ncreate file-sharing programs to take extra steps such as making it explicit that their\nsoftware not be used in any way to download or distribute copyrighted material.\nAfter successfully suing Napster and Audiogalaxy, the recording industry was still not\nsatisfied and began targeting individual users of online file-sharing programs in 2003.\nThe recording industry's primary targets are users who share music. However, if online\npiracy continues to exist at such a large-scale, it will be no surprise if they go after any\nindividuals downloading music as well. The recording industry is able to find the IP\naddresses of these individuals but is unable to find out exactly who they are without the\nrelevant ISP revealing that information to them.\nVerizon Communications was taken to court in 2003 by the recording industry to reveal\nthe names of four people that had been found to share a great deal of music.33 Citing the\nDMCA, the court ruled in favor of the recording industry and the decision stood even\nafter Verizon appealed. A month after Verizon lost their court battle, MIT and Boston\nCollege were subpoenaed to turn over the names of students whose IP addresses the\nrecording industry had found to be sharing a lot of music.34 Because the lawsuit was\nfiled in the wrong state it was dismissed. At the end of 2003, a federal appeals court\nruled that the DMCA does not require ISPs to give the names of their users to the\n\nrecording industry.\nThe recording industry continued with their lawsuits suing\nindividuals knowing when only their IP addresses. Surprisingly, the RIAA has now set\nup a rather efficient system of identifying people sharing music, sending them a notice\nthat they are being sued, and quickly settling outside of court for a few thousand dollars.\nWho benefits from the litigation?\nIt is difficult to determine who receives the proceeds from this litigation. However, some\ninformation can be obtained and some associated inferences can be made. Similarly,\nsome interesting things concerning who gets paid and how much they receive can be\ninferred. The big winners in these actions are the lawyers and the recording companies\nwhile for the most part the artists receive only a small fraction of the proceeds.\nThe fact that lawyers benefit from this can be inferred. Every action taken by the RIAA\nor one of its member companies, independent of outcome, yields fees for the law firms\nthat represent them. The sheer volume of case load should amount to a windfall in fees\nfor these firms.\nMoreover, it is also intuitively obvious that the recording companies are able to get large\namounts of money from these settlements arrived at through little or no effort on their\npart as discussed above.\nThe question is does this benefit the artist or is this just a way for the company employing\nthat artist to extract more money from the market independent of what the musician is\n\npaid? In lawsuits filed by recording companies to protect their copyrighted works, the\nartists typically receive no money for the lost royalties caused by illegal distribution.\nRecord companies are notorious for withholding and shortchanging on royalty payments\nas illustrated by the fact that in May of 2004 New York State Attorney General Elliot\nSpitzer had to step in and force many labels to pay out royalty checks that they had\nwithheld.35 60% of artists believe that the RIAA campaign of suing individuals will not\nbenefit that at all.36\nThe fact alone that artists are not fervently against P2P file sharing should serve as an\nindication as to the small amounts of money they have or expecting to recover from these\nlawsuits. 43% of paid artists are in favor of P2P networks as they promote and distribute\nan artist's work to a broad audience. Moreover, 2/3 of artists believe that the companies\nthat make the content available and create the protocols for transfer for free should be the\ntargets of the RIAA versus attacking individual users.37\nSummary\nThe issue of file sharing related to music is complex and has become quite significant.\nConsidering all these lawsuits, the real question is whether allowing the RIAA to sue all\nthese companies and individuals is in fact promoting \"the progress of science and useful\narts\" as stated in the U.S. Constitution. First of all, allowing lawsuits against these tech\ncompanies may actually impede the progress of science and technology. Just imagine if\nHollywood and the movie and recording industries were able to stop the distribution of\nVCRs, cassette recorders, CD and DVD burners, IPods, copy machines, etc. Action\n\ndefinitely must be taken to stop the illegal distribution of copyrighted material over the\nInternet but allowing these tech companies to be sued simply for monetary damages may\nnot be the appropriate approach. The government needs to step in and somehow get the\nrecording industry and tech companies to work together.\nSince the money the recording industry is receiving from these lawsuits goes directly to\nthem instead of the artists, one wonders how that is helping promote the progress of\nuseful arts. It would be more appropriate to give the litigation proceeds directly to the\nartists.\nUnfortunately, in many instances the company, not the artist, owns the copyright on the\nmusic. Since copyright owners have the right to enforce their copyrights, this sets up an\ninteresting question: Do copyright holders have the ability to enforce their copyrights\nwhen doings so impedes the advancement of the arts?\nThe government is currently not fulfilling its duty to promote the progress of science and\nuseful arts. Allowing the recording industry to proceed with their lawsuits is not the\nsolution. Despite these suits, online piracy is still rampant. The recording industry needs\nto somehow work with these software companies and come up with a system that\nmutually agreeable and effective.\nConsidering the magnitude of this problem government intervention is most likely\nneeded at this point. A possible solution would be to first stop all the lawsuits. Making\n\nthe RIAA wealthier isn't solving the problem. Forcing software companies to provide\nfilters that do not return copyrighted material after a search would be the next step to\ntake. No filter will be perfect but effective filters can be created. Software companies\nand the recording industry should work together to identify users distributing copyrighted\nmaterial and only sue individuals who are repeat offenders. This is only an idea but it\nshould be understood that there is no perfect solution. No matter what strategy is\nundertaken, there will always be individuals who participate in online piracy. The\ncurrent situation and activities have proven to not be the solution. The goal of any\nsolution would be to successfully alleviate the problem of online piracy while still\npromoting the progress of science. The challenge will be to develop a solution that will\nmeet the conflicting needs and desires of the record industry, computer/internet entities,\nartists and the public.\n\nEnd Notes\n1 http://securitypronews.com/news/securitynews/spn-45-\n20051129ChooseyKidsChooseIllegalFileSharing.html\n2 Internet Usage Statistics, Cornell University, 2002.\nhttp://www.cit.cornell.edu/computer/students/bandwidth/charts.html\n3 http://www.mpaa.org/CurrentReleases/2004_11_04_Statistics.pdf\n4 http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=31618\nhttp://www.beaconnewspaper.com/media/paper540/news/2003/11/18/Opinion/FileSharing.Is.The.Moral.Eq\nuivalent.Of.Stealing.A.Car-560417.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomain=www.beaconnewspaper.com\n6 Oberholzer, Felix and Koleman Strumpf, \"The Effect of File Sharing on Recording Sales An Empirical\nAnalysis,\" 2004.\n7 http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/pdf/2005midYrStats.pdf\n8 http://www.musicunited.org/3_artists.html\n9 http://usatoday.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=USATODAY.com+-\n+How+do+musicians+feel+about+Internet+file-\nsharing%3F&expire=&urlID=10192781&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Ftech%2Fc\nolumnist%2Fericjsinrod%2F2004-05-12-sinrod_x.htm&partnerID=1665\n10 http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf, p 1\n11 Ibid, p 4\n12 Acohido, Brian, \"Fed Raid Pounces on Equipment for Digital Priracy,\" USA Today, August 26, 2004,\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2004-08-26-copy-crackdown_x.htm\n13 Bridis, Ted, \"Some Twists in Music Piracy Lawsuits,\" Biz Report, August 23, 2004,\nhttp://www.bizreport.com/news/7847\n14 http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf, p 7\n15 http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2125054/riaa-sues-493-p2p-users\n16 http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/sample_riaa_letter.pdf\n17 http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2125054/riaa-sues-493-p2p-users\n18 http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/2195.cfm\n19 http://www.dmca.harvard.edu/dmca_overview.php\n20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster\n21 http://computer.howstuffworks.com/napster.htm\n\n22 Lardner, James. \"Annals of Law: The Betamax Case.\" The New Yorker, 6 April 1987.\n23 Op Cite, Wikipedia - Napster\n24 http://computer.howstuffworks.com/napster2.htm\n25 http://www.riaa.com/news/filings/napster_faq.asp\n26 http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/06/26/in_depth_scitech/timeline560590_0_main.shtml\n27 http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-922904.html\n28 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa\n29 Ibid\n30 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Studios%2C_Inc._v._Grokster%2C_Ltd.\n31 Ibid\n32 Ibid\n33 http://news.com.com/2100-1023-960838.html\n34 http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/riaa.html\n35 http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-05-04-music-royalties_x.htm\n36 http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Artists.Musicians_Report.pdf , p vi\n37 Ibid, p v- vi"

      "content": "Proposal for Fostering Commercialization of Patents\nAndrew Pinkham\nDecember 19, 2005\n6.901 Inventions and Patents\nProf. Robert H. Rines\n\nThe premise for patents in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution says that\npatents and copyrights exist to \"Promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.\" The\npatent system is intended to promote development of inventions by granting exclusive\nrights to the inventor for a limited time period. However, by many estimates over ninety\npercent of patents are never commercialized. Reducing the percentage of total patents\nthat are never commercialized is not the objective of my proposal. Rather, the solution\nproposed here is designed to encourage inventors to patent inventions expeditiously and\nproceed to promptly commercially develop them.\nOne of the reasons I think many patents are never commercialized is because they\nserve another purpose, which is to abstract innovative ideas into analyzable form, much\nlike writing does for words. Writing is a method for abstracting oral discourse into static,\nvisual form, freeing one's mind from memorization to think about new ideas. Indeed,\npatents themselves rely on writing to describe inventions and keep records of them.\nSimilarly, patents serve to abstract inventive ideas. By the exclusionary rights patents\nprovide, they disclose the details of the invention publicly, and free the inventor or\nresearcher from having to keep the invention secret. My proposal will protect this use of\npatents, promote patenting, and foster prompt commercialization.\nThe first dimension of my proposal to accomplish this is to create a U.S.\nCommercialization Classification system (USCC) that would make the USPTO a\ncrossroads for communication between inventors, companies, and entrepreneurs. The\nUSPTO would become a center for commercial and intellectual collaboration. The USCC\nsystem would classify commercialized patents under their areas of commercial use, and\nclassify non-commercialized patents and applications under their prospective areas of\ncommercialization. The USCC structure would consist of a tree of classes and subclasses\n\nsimilar to the U.S. Patent Classification system (USPC), and would be part of The Office\nof Patent Classification.1 Each subclass would be subordinate to the subclass directly\nabove it. Thus, the classes would partition the entire scope of commercial industries into\nseparate categories. They would be inclusive of everything deemed to constitute\ncommercialization.\nThe classes would consist of all industries in useful commercial areas. An\nexample of a class would include the cell phone industry. The subclasses would divide\nthe entire industry into product categories. For the above example, the first level of the\ntree would classify cell phones based on their communication protocol, such as CDMA,\nTDMA, or any other cellular protocol. The next level of the tree, under each of these\nsubclasses, would divide phones based on their type of electronic design or\nmicroprocessor family, such as PXA27x processors, RISC processors, or non-processor\nbased phones. Any product would reside in a branch of the tree alongside its similar\nproducts. Moreover, it would be possible for any patent to be classified as belonging to\nany number of these classes. A patent could be classified under disparate product\nsubclasses that technologically had little in common as long as the patent had been\ncommercialized in those areas. The result of such a system is that all patents that have\nbeen commercialized in a given product subclass are returned when that commercial\ncategory is queried.\nA list of the commercial classes which a patent belongs to would be shown under\nthe heading Current Commercial Class in the patent text. This list would be updated once\ninformation had been obtained by the USPTO that a patent was being commercialized or\nhad ceased to be commercialized in a particular area. Within this heading, the complete\nhistory of the USCC status of the patent would be stored. Any subclasses that the patent\n\npreviously resided in, but had since been removed from, would also be shown. Stored\nwith each USCC subclass listing would be the date the patent was added to the subclass,\nthe date it was removed, the name of the company or licensee, and a method for\ncontacting that company.\nThe implementation of this system therefore requires companies to fully disclose\nand prove the commercial status of every one of their patents. Under the current patent\nsystem, I think companies often use patents defensively to strengthen their company in a\ncommercial area. They hide behind a wall of patents, many of which they are not actually\nusing. They also obtain patents because they think there is a slight chance they might\nneed them in the future. The USCC, however, would force the inventor to open up to the\npublic the details of how the patent is being used. Companies may still try to lie about the\nuse of their patents. In cases where lying is suspected, USPTO inspectors would need to\nbe shown by the company how their patent is being used.\nThe USCC groups together patents which are used by a particular industrial\nprocess, commercial product, scientific procedure, etc. Thus, this system would promote\nand expedite the forming of patent pools. A patent pool is an agreement between patent\nholders to license their patents to each other or to third parties.2 Cross-licensing of groups\nof patents between patent owners and others allows access to the technologies needed by\nresearchers and companies to perform innovation and research. In biotechnology and\nbiological sciences, especially genetics and stem cell research, patent pools are important\nin allowing researchers to use patented basic methods and processes, enabling more\nresearch to be continued. Patent pools could more easily be created and used if the USCC\nwere implemented. One advantage of patent pools is they mitigate the problem created\nwhen companies who hold patents on basic, fundamental processes in an industry block\n\nothers from commercializing their products. They also reduce costs associated with\nlicensing transactions and patent litigation, which are large expenditures for small\ncompanies. Also, in similarity with the intent of the proposed system, patent pools foster\ncommunication and sharing of technical information between its members. As a result of\ncommunication, they discourage trade secrets, discourage companies from\nsimultaneously developing the same technology, and encourage novel innovation. The\nUSCC, in this way, would be a structure encouraging companies to create patent pools,\ncross license patents, and patent novel technologies. Information about patent pools\nwould be imbued in the USCC structure by annotating the patents with a tag identifying\nthem as belonging to a certain patent pool. Patents in a commercial subclass of the\nUSCC which belonged to a patent pool would each be tagged with data about the pool,\nsuch as the date it was formed and the companies that created it.\nFirst and foremost, however, the USCC would foster entrepreneurship and\nprofiting by the inventor. Often, an inventor will file a patent for an invention with little\nknowledge of the commercialization potential for the patent. There is significant cost and\ndifficulty associated with finding prospective companies that would be candidates for\nlicensing the invention. Furthermore, it may be difficult or impossible to discover\ncompanies that are expanding toward the same technology that the inventor's patent\ncovers. The USCC system would be used by inventors to discover companies who had\nlicensed patents in the same commercial area as their invention, and who thus might be\ninterested in licensing the inventor's technology. The resource the USCC would provide\nwould thus inspire and motivate the inventor to pursue the commercialization or licensing\nof his patent further.\n\nIt is also possible for the inventor to found a company to market the invention, in\nwhich case the USCC would be a tool allowing the company's founders to discover\npatents in the same commercial area as their product, some of which the company may\nneed to license. A company that recently acquired a patent would use the USCC as a\nmethod for researching what other patents exist in the commercial area in which they\npropose to commercialize their patented technology. By enabling inventors and\nentrepreneurs to explore the commercial context that their patented technology could\nbecome a part of, the USCC would encourage inventors to pursue commercializing their\ntechnology.\nAll non-commercialized patents would be classified under a separate USCC\nsystem based on their areas of potential or prospective commercialization. This\nclassification would be used by companies to find patents potentially beneficial to their\ncompany. Companies would use the non-commercialized USCC system to research\nrecently patented technologies that had not yet been developed. By searching through the\nnon-commercialized classification, companies would find emerging technologies that\nthey would have otherwise been unable to find. Companies would discover non-\ncommercialized patents in fields that they were involved in or expanding into. These\npatents could be for cutting edge research that hadn't found a commercial use yet. The\ncompany would likely find the newly patented technology useful and, in some cases,\ndecide to license it from the inventor.\nThis proposal relates to, and could be used in conjunction with, the system for\nexpeditiously bringing together prospective licensees and inventors described in Create\nor Perish by Robert H. Rines.3 Under that proposal, interested licensee companies could\nsubscribe to a service provided by the Patent Office or other part of the Department of\n\nCommerce. Inventors who agreed to participate in the system would have the details of\ntheir patent application promptly made available to the prospective licensees. These\ncompanies would then evaluate the invention and contact the inventor directly to pursue\nit further, and would agree to keep private the details of the invention. This would\npromote the rapid filing of inventions for review by potential licensees. USPC\nclassification examiners would be employed for these tasks. Under my proposal, an\nexaminer from the USCC or non-commercialized USCC system would be employed to\nevaluate the commercial subclass that the invention would fall under, and thus to find the\nrelevant companies.\nThe proposed USCC system has several benefits. It encourages prompt patenting\nby allowing inventors to explore how they could profit from their invention. It fosters\ncommercialization by enabling entrepreneurship and assists inventors and companies in\nlicensing technologies. As a result, it expedites the process of developing technologies.\nAs the next part of my proposal will demonstrate, this system promotes rapid\ndevelopment of inventions, such as software inventions, and puts patents temporarily in\nthe public domain if they fail to become commercialized.\nThe second dimension of my proposal introduces a restriction on time to\ncommercialization and proposes a system for labeling patents based on their commercial\nstatus. It supports the objectives of the USCC system and relies on the materialization of\nthe USCC for its success. A patent, at any point in time, is to be tagged as one of four\ndifferent types. If the patent has already been commercialized by its filing date, it is\nlabeled as a type I patent. If the patent has not yet been commercialized, it is labeled as\ntype II. At any time, when a class I patent ceases to be commercialized, it becomes a type\nII patent. The inventor must also disclose upon filing his intentions for development of\n\nthe invention. These descriptions of intention could constitute many different strategies.\nFor example, the invention may already be commercialized, the inventor may disclose\nintentions to commercialize with his own funding, or disclose intentions to license to an\noutside company.\nAfter a time-to-commercialization period from the date of first possible\ndevelopment, if the patent by that time has not been commercially developed, the status\nof the patent changes from type II to type III. Type III opens up the patent to direct\ncommercialization by the public. In type III, there are no mandatory compulsory\nlicensing royalties or other regulations. Any company can then start to use and develop\nthe patented technology as long as the patent is in class III.\nThe time period that the patent can remain type II varies depending on the nature\nof the patent. One year is sufficient time for most patents to have begun transformation\ninto a product, or to have found a company to license the patent if the patented\ntechnology is able to be developed. This is not true for all patents, such as\npharmaceuticals, and this will be discussed in more depth later. Opening up the patent to\nfree use by anyone will allow the technology to grow, if this is at all possible. The hope is\nthat by moving the patent to type III it will open up a new opportunity for the technology\nto be developed. In general, it will foster the development and commercial use of the\ntechnology by temporarily opening up the patent to the public domain. The inventor of\nthe patent, after the public has been allowed to discover or create new commercial uses\nfor it, may then be able to develop and commercialize his technology.\nIf the inventor subsequently commercializes his invention, the type of the patent\nchanges from III to IV. In type IV, public use is prohibited except for the individuals who\nhad begun to commercialize the patent while it was type III. These companies are\n\n\"grandfathered in.\" The inventor now has to compete with the other companies who are\nno longer excluded from the use of the patent. The justification for this is that these\nindividuals created a use or opportunity for the patent that was not there before. The\ninventor, in the first year after filing, had been given ample time to find a use for his\npatent if one existed during that time. The companies, who then pioneered an application\nfor the patent, should be considered as having contributed to the usefulness of the\ntechnology, and should be allowed to continue using the patent. They created a new\ncontext in which the patent now exists. All others, however, should be excluded from\nusing the patent because the inventor should be allowed to profit from his patent, in this\nnew context.\nType I and IV patents are the only types of patents that exist in the USCC. As\nlong as the inventor continues creating a product or licensing the patent, it remains in\ntype IV. This situation can lead to several outcomes. First, if any of the grandfathered\ncompanies leave the market entirely and cease involvement with the patent, they are not\npermitted to begin using the patent again at any time, until such time as the patent re-\nenters type III. The rationale is that after a company stops use, the context of the patent\nchanges and the company can no longer use the patent. Second, if the inventor ceases\ncommercialization, he can re-enter and begin again at any time, because he owns the\npatent. Third, if the inventor and all grandfathered companies, if there are any, cease to\ncontinue commercialization, the patent returns to class II. The inventor is thus given\nanother year to find a commercial application for his invention, and exclude all others\nfrom using his invention during that time period. After 20 years from the filing date, the\npatent moves to the expired class and it goes into the public domain.\n\nType III patents offer a unique opportunity for inventors and companies to take\nadvantage of them. By adding a type heading to patents which displays the type number\nof each patent, the patent database could, for example, be easily searched for only type III\npatents. This search returns only non-expired and non-commercialized patents. It\nprovides a list of novel, useful, and relatively recently patented technologies which are\nopen to use by the public because of an inability to commercialize.\nThis solution would be used in conjunction with a patent system that employs\ndifferent types of patents. Individualized type-specific standards would be used to\nexamine different kinds of patents, such as software patents, pharmaceutical patents, or\npublic health patents. The time-to-commercialization length before the patent enters class\nIII would be one of the differences between these types of patents. In the case of\npharmaceutical patents, a drug cannot be fully commercialized until after it has been\napproved by the FDA. The FDA approval time for new drug applications is often longer\nthan twelve months. The company then has a shorter time to profit before cheaper generic\ndrugs are introduced. The time restriction for a pharmaceutical patent I would thus\npropose to start after FDA approval and extend for six months. For software patents, the\ntime-to-commercialization constraint would be shorter than one year. It typically should\ntake less time for a new software product to be commercialized. The time-to-\ncommercialization constraint would start at the date of first possible commercial\ndevelopment of the invention. A system for allowing different types of inventions to be\nheld to different patentability standards is not the subject of this paper. But even in the\nabsence of a system with different patentability standards, the time-to-commercialization\nconstraint is dependent on the type of patent.\n\nThe restriction on time to commercialization is designed to encourage prompt\ndevelopment and commercialization. The effectiveness of this restriction, however, is\nhighly dependent on the success of the first dimension of my proposal. If the first\ndimension is well implemented and fosters patenting, the commercialization time\nrestriction will make the system even more successful. The first dimension, through the\nbenefits of the USCC, gives incentive to the inventor to expeditiously file his invention.\nThe second dimension, through the time restriction, gives increased incentive for the\ninventor to rapidly develop and commercialize.\nAn alternative strategy for promoting commercialization of inventions employs\ncompulsory licensing by the government. This method has several drawbacks, however,\nincluding an increase in the government's size and power. Compulsory licensing of\npatents has been used by countries to increase the supply of a product, such as the\nnumber of antibiotic doses during an epidemic. The government forces the patent holder\nto license the technology for a royalty determined by the government.\nTo promote development of inventions, compulsory licensing with a perpetually\ndecreasing royalty would be instituted if a patent were not commercialized. Time\nconstraints would be placed on how long the inventor would have before compulsory\nlicensing would take effect, how the royalty would decrease in time after compulsory\nlicensing began, and when the patent would expire. After a patent is approved, the\nexaminer must determine whether the technology is being commercially developed by\nthe inventor. The classification status would be subject to change at any time. This\nwould occur when the USPTO received information that the patent was being\ncommercialized, or if this had stopped occurring. Suppose a company was trying to\nlicense a technology from its inventor but had been unsuccessful for a certain time\n\nperiod. The government could then set the royalty and terms of the license agreement\nsuch that the company would still be willing to pay for the technology, and the patent\nholder would be forced to accept the licensing agreement. If the company didn't accept\nthe initial terms, in time the terms would become more favorable for the company. The\nroyalty would decrease in time and eventually reach zero after a certain time period, at\nwhich point the inventor's patent would have expired. The royalty paid to the inventor\nwould decrease slowly in time at first, and then decrease more quickly. Once the\ncompany began licensing under the compulsory licensing terms, the inventor and\ncompany would always be free to negotiate other terms, unless the inventor decided to\nstop licensing.\nThe compulsory licensing agreement and time constraints would depend on the\ntype of technology. This compulsory licensing scheme would thus be useful in a patent\nsystem that gave different types of patents dependent on the technology or industry.\nDifferent patentability standards would be used to examine software or medical patents,\nfor example. In the case of software, compulsory licensing would decrease the royalty\nquickly if the patent were not developed. However, this method for increasing\ndevelopment of patents would be most useful only in cases where the patent holder was\ndemanding excessive royalties. It would also put a large amount of power in the hands of\nthe government.\nOne instance when compulsory licensing was used in the U.S. to try to increase\nmarket competition and commercialization was in the mechanical reproduction of\nmusical works in the Edison era. The U.S. Copyright Act of 1909 Article E stipulated that\nto be mechanically reproduced as grooves on a phonograph or gramophone, the\ncomposer's work needed to be licensed. This went into effect for compositions published\n\nafter the 1909 act. Furthermore, there was a Compulsory License Clause. This stated that\nafter the first mechanical reproduction was licensed, anyone else would be able to license\nmechanical reproductions for a guaranteed fixed royalty of two cents per copy. This was\ndone as a benefit to the public interest, so that after the first mechanical reproduction was\nlicensed, there would be free-market competition. This compulsory licensing put an end\nto exclusive contracts for reproducing music, however it did not apply to recordings of\nlive musical performances, only to reproductions of musical compositions. Edison's\nrecord company quickly signed contracts with Victor Herbert's Orchestra which stated\nthat Herbert would perform exclusively for Edison, and thus that only Edison could\nreproduce his works. The compulsory licensing clause of the Copyright Act of 1909 thus\nfailed to end most exclusive licensing contracts.4\nAnother alternative solution to promote commercialization, rather than mere\ninvention, is suggested in Create or Perish.3 If what should be promoted is innovation,\ndevelopment, and entrepreneurship, rather than blind invention, then exclusive rights to\nthe inventor may not be the best form of incentive. If this is the case, a more effective\nincentive would be tax benefits to the innovator given over a period of time. As a result,\nthis would also greatly reduce the need for patent litigation. This proposal, however, by\ngiving more power and control to the government, I think may lead to problems similar to\nthose of compulsory licensing.\nThe solution I proposed would both create incentive for inventors to patent\ntechnologies expeditiously and encourage rapid commercialization of that technology.\nThe combination of both proposed dimensions of this system I think would be self\nperpetuating. As more patents would be commercialized and classified under the USCC\nsystem, more commercialized patents would be discovered, which would provoke further\n\ninnovation and commercialization. Also, patents on communication and database system\ntechnologies that would make it more efficient to classify patents based on their\ncommercialization status would serve to perpetuate more innovation. I think my proposal\nwould improve the patent system by enhancing its effectiveness in fostering development\nof new forms of technology.\nReferences\n1. \"Overview of the Classification System.\" June 2005: United States Patent and\nTrademark Office.\n<http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/opc/documents/overview.pdf>\n2.

Though it may not be entirely\nsuited in all respects to our current problems and needs, and though sometimes\nit may have been misused, its record of achievement in the progress of our\ncountry is indelibly written on the pages of history. Its current service, despite\nthe fact that it is not being fully utilized in the second half of the century, seems\nto me equally indisputable; though some critics without firsthand experience in\nthis field may not agree. Those critics are free to write their own books.\nI have undertaken to write mine as a champion of the philosophy that today,\nas much as ever, incentives that make a person fight to be an individual promote\nthe welfare the whole state. In my lectures, many of which have been included\nin this book, I frankly paint a picture, particularly for engineers and applied\nscientists, that is based on this philosophy and thus supports patents1\nBut invention, patents, and innovation cannot be treated apart from their\nsocial, political, and economic environment, despite mechanistic courses given\nin law schools. Thus, to review the principles of patent law without delving into\nthe interplay of many aspects of our society would be to discuss a theoretical,\nnonexistent system. This book, therefore, is not addressed solely to engineers\nand applied scientists; some parts are addressed to lawyers, economists, busi\nnessmen, and politicians.\nI have found the problem of presenting all facets so that they may be under\nstood by readers of quite varied disciplines to be not without difficulty. For this\nreason illustrations have been confined to technology that can readily be com\nprehended by nontechnicians, and legal and economic discussions have been kept\nsufficiently elementary to be grasped at least in part by the technical reader,\nbut without sacrificing the point intended for the legalist or economist.\nThose who expect an engineering \"cookbook\" approach to this subject will\nnot find it here. Similarly, those who look for a presentation in the form of a\nProcrustean \"case study\" will be equally disappointed.\nTo write an interdisciplinary book requires a mixture of interdisciplinary\ntechniques, and so I have tried to interweave history, primary principles, proce\ndures, problems, and points of conflict into what I believe to be the true fabric\npattern of the patent system, struggling to stay alive in a world of rapid change.\nBecause of this somewhat unorthodox approach, I have summarized the scope\n1Gordon McKay Lectures on Patent Law, given at Harvard University, 1956-58.\n\nCreate or Perish\nof each chapter at its head, and, in some cases, the reason for the approach used\nin order that the reader may better understand my mode or presentation.\nIn Chapter 1, a survey of the origin and historical background of the Amer\nican patent system is presented; and, at its conclusion, serious questions are\nraised as to whether that system is currently either effectively performing its\noriginal historical purposes or meeting the requirements of the present. I hope\nthat by the end of the book, the reader may have gained an insight into some\nof the answers to these questions.\nChapter 2 reviews the role of the Patent Office and the courts in adminis\ntration of the patent laws, especially for the benefit of those unfamiliar with the\nadministrative details of patent application prosecution and judicial review.\nThe statutory provisions of American patent law are discussed in Chapter\n3, with reference to actual cases interpreted and decided by the courts. While\nthe classes of patentable inventions and the conditions of patentability can be\nreadily agreed upon, there is widespread conflict as to the standard set by the\n1952 Patent Act to determine what is \"invention\" and what is \"obvious.\" I\nhave, accordingly, devoted a section of this chapter to discussing this conflict,\ngiving my own views - predicated upon what I feel is in the national interest,\nnamely an interpretation that encourages the independent American inventor\nand his backers as well as corporate inventors. In this connection the chapter\nconcludes with statistics offered by leading independent inventors pointing up\ntheir vital current contributions to technology and the necessity for liberal and\nsympathetic legal recognition of their work if the independent inventor is not to\ndisappear from the American scene.\nIn Chapter 4, I have carried forward an illustrative approach found most\neffective in lecturing: tying together the complete picture of innovation - from\nthe conception and invention stage, through financial backing and development,\nentrepreneuring, business formation, and legal contests with pirates. Here I have\nused the medium of the Bell Telephone Cases, because this outdated invention\ninvolves technology and a degree of importance familiar to all readers, and\nbecause almost everything that could happen did happen to Bell, except the\nanonymity experienced by many current inventors from which he was saved by\na single vote in the Supreme Court.\nStrongly woven through the fabric of the invention-innovation cycle are the\nrelations between inventor and employer and between inventor and potential\nuser or licensee. These include typical industrial, university, and governmental\ncontract provisions. Since inventions are frequently stolen, the pitfalls facing\nthe inventor are reviewed in Chapter 5. There are, however, very few proven\ncases of such piracy, and so I have selected a previously little-known example\n(in the field of piezoelectricity) that took over two decades to document and\nestablish by legal decision. The publication of this exposure, it is hoped, may\nforewarn the inventor, and perhaps give second thoughts to business and govern\nmental agencies in the matter of trying to circumvent the proprietary position\nof inventors.\nChapter 6 discusses critically recent proposals for improving the patent sys\ntem, including current conflicting views in Congress and the courts as to gov\n\nIntroduction\nernment rights in patents and other matters.\nI have left to Chapter 7 a consideration of the exciting modernization pro\ngram being planned by the European Economic Community with the view of\nproviding a single common European patent and law of patents. The possible\neffect of this upon the American system is noted, and some of my own views\nwith regard to possible immediate improvements in the administration of our\nsystem are presented.\nThough one of expected primary groups of readers of this book is the en\ngineering profession, the solution to current problems in the protection of in\nventions and patents calls for more than mere engineering consideration. There\nis a decided, and even primary, legal side concerning which something must be\nsaid. In Chapter 8, therefore, I have supplemented Chapter 7's technical sug\ngestions for Patent Office and administrative improvement with proposals for\nmodernizing judicial review. I have tried to formulate these in language that\nengineers can follow, but without losing their force for the legal and quasi-legal\nprofessionals.\nChapter 9 points up the general economic consequences of the above prob\nlems.\nIf in the end I am considered to have been too harsh on the courts of our\nland, my answer must be that my position is based on more than mere academic\nstudy. My attack is considered, deliberate, and to me necessary. My plea is\nsimple. Before it is too late, let us restore to the individual his importance and\ndignity, and recognize and protect the fruits of his mind. A dynamic society\nled by free and encouraged creative minds - with government back in its role of\nservant and partner - offers the Free World's best hope.\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 1\nThe Origin and Development of The\nAmerican Patent System\nThis chapter presents a survey of the historical background of the\nAmerican patent system and, at its conclusion, raises serious ques\ntions as to whether that system is currently either performing effec\ntively the original historical purposes or meeting the needs of the\npresent.\n\"Oysters stuffed with honey\" may sound like a gastronomic nightmare. To\nthe authorities of the Greek colony of Sybaris 1 , some five hundred years before\nChrist, however, it may well have been \"an unusual and peculiar dish\" that no\none had the right to prepare and serve for a one-year period but the cook who\noriginated it.\nThis official invitation to indigestion is one of the earliest recorded instances\nof a grant paralleling somewhat our concept of a patent granted for an inven\ntion. The policy of grants of numerous kinds by the state to individuals who\nhad deserved well at its hands was inherited by medieval Europe from early\ntimes. Rome, for example, had rewarded her military heroes with triumphal\nprocessions, and had parceled out to them her conquered lands, upon which\nthey might levy taxes. English monarchs exercised the prerogative of granting\na right, franchise, charter, commission, office, monopoly, or the like - for exam\nple, a title of nobility or permission to explore the New World. They did so in\neach case through the medium of a document addressed \"To all to whom these\npresents shall come,\" an open document termed \"Litterae Patentes\" or Letters\nPatent - letters openly recorded in the Patent Rolls.\nThat the English king had good reason for granting at least some kinds of\nletters patent, under proper circumstances, can be understood from the follow\ning considerations.\nMedieval Europe was a barbarous or semibarbarous ter\nritory, not far removed from savagery. Industry and trade were in a precari\nous condition. The nobles, not only in England but also on the Continent, as\n1Athenaeus; The Deipnosophists (3 Vols.), C. D. Yonge, Ed. , Bohn's Classical Library,\n1854, p. 835.\n\nCreate or Perish\nrulers supreme in their particular domains, demanded tolls from all who passed\nthrough their territories. They could do this uncontrolled by their supposedly\nsuperior monarchs, by fortifying themselves on hillsides and other places of ad\nvantage. Not until the invention of gunpowder were these monarchs able to\nbring their nobles under subjection.\nThe trade of those days was conducted by merchants who traveled from coun\ntry to country through the domains of various nobles. Because the merchants\nwere subjected to great expense and risk in the carrying on of their business,\nthey were compelled to charge very high prices for the goods that they intro\nduced for sale in Europe. Many articles were expensive luxuries beyond the\nreach of all but the very wealthiest.\nThe Crusades, beginning in the eleventh century A.D. and continuing for\nseveral centuries more, brought the Europeans into contact with the Saracens,\nat that time a comparatively highly cultured people. They had developed the\narts and were skilled in such sciences as algebra and astronomy, the very word\n\"algebra\" coming from the Arabic.\nUpon returning to their homes, the Crusaders carried with them much that\nthey had found in the East, including knowledge of various arts and industries.\nItalian city-states, such as Genoa and Venice, the most powerful groups of their\nday, developed as a direct result of their proximity to the East. They prospered\nbecause of the trade that they had built up between the East and the West.\nIn order to have something to sell, in return for the goods they obtained in\nthe East, they stimulated new arts and industries by granting monopolies to\nfavored individuals who were willing to take the risks involved. Early grants are\nreported for grain mills, and in 1474 the Venetian Senate voted the first of all\npatent laws applying to all classes of invention. This law forbade infringement\nfor a term of ten years, but gave free access to the government, provided that the\nlatter dealt with the inventor and did not permit others to employ the invention\nin the government's behalf .\nTo protect their trade and the industries they had established, European\nmerchants banded together for common defense organized their own armies\nand navies. During the late Middle Ages they became quite powerful, as the\nHanseatic League attests.\nNot until several centuries later, when new trade\nroutes were opened up after the discovery of the New World, were the Italian\ncity-states reduced to their present status as subdivisions of a larger nation.\nBut the Italian cities were not the only communities thus benefited. The\ngoods and skills germinated by this trade with the East gradually spread over\nthe whole of Europe. Because England was the farthest west and physically\nseparated from the continent, it was not in the most favored position to secure\nthese advantages, which the other states often guarded jealously. To overcome\nthese disadvantages the English monarchs adopted the continental practice of\ngranting patents, usually to foreigners, giving them for limited periods of time\n2This statement is based on information given me by some British patent lawyers who\nremembered hearing a paper entitled, \"The Early History of Patents of Patents for Invention,\"\ngiven by M. Frumian before the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents in England sometime\nin the 1930's.\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nthe exclusive right to carry on such new industries as, in consideration of the\ngrant, they agreed to import into the realm.\nIn this way the cloth industry was introduced into England. In 1331, Edward\nIII granted a patent to John Kempe of Flanders, weaver of woolen cloth, and in\n1336 to Brabant weavers. In 1440, one was issued to John of Shiedame to enable\nhim to import a newly invented process of manufacturing salt3 . The Tudors,\nsuccessors of Edward IV, attracted skilled foreign artisans by negotiations -\nGerman armorers, Italian shipwrights, Normandy glassmakers, and French iron\nworkers4 .\nPatents were also given to individuals and companies for other services to the\nstate, to induce them to embark upon commercial or other ventures involving\nrisk. Among these were the East India Trading Company, chartered by Queen\nElizabeth I, and the Hudsons's Bay Company, still very much a commercial\nforce in Canada, chartered by her immediate successor.\nIn the then relatively undeveloped state of industry and commerce, patents\nof this nature were undoubtedly necessary for the good of the realm and the well\nbeing of its subjects. The objects sought thereby were: first, domestic supply\nof foreign, high-priced goods which would reduce their cost and consequently\nencourage their wider use; and, secondly, employment for English workmen in\nthe new industries thus established. Some of the patents, indeed, specifically\nprovided that English apprentices be employed.\nGomme, late librarian of the British Patent Office5 , for example, quotes from\nthe 1449 patent granted by Henry VI to John of Utynam, \". . . to instruct divers\nlieges of the crown in the art of making colored glass.\" It is reported6 that the\nprecipitating cause of this patent grant was the requirement for colored windows\nat Eton College.\nMuch later, the Court of King's Bench clearly enunciated the rationale of\nsuch patents:\nBut if a man hath brought in a new invention and a new trade within\nthe Kingdom, in peril of his life, and consumption of his estate or\nstock . . . or if a man hath made a new discovery of anything, in such\ncases the King . . . in recompense of his costs and travail, may grant\nby charter unto him, that he only shall use such a trade or trafique\nfor a certain time, because at first the people of the Kingdom are\nignorant, and have not the knowledge or skill to use it7 .\nBut beneficent measures are frequently attended by abuses.\nIn granting\ntheir patents, the English kings did not always consider whether or not these\nconferred benefits upon their subjects.\nThe latters' revolt against King John at Runnymede, in 1215, resulted in\nthe famous Magna Carta. The monarch there had to agree that merchants were\n3A. A. Gomme, Patents of Invention, Longmans Green and Co., 1946, p. 12\n4Journal of the Patent Office Society, Vol. 18, pp. 21ff. (1936).\n5A. A. Gomme, Patents of Invention, p. 12\n6H. Hardin, Patent Office Centenary, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1953, pp. 21, 34.\n778 Eng. Rep. 148 (Clothworkers of Ipswich, King's Bench, 1615).\n\nCreate or Perish\nnot to be prohibited from engaging in trade, \"if they were not openly prohibited\nbefore.\" This suggests no upsetting of current patents in trade, but restrictions\non the monarch's power to grant further patents in existing trades.\nThe Magna Carta was not the only contract that the English kings made\nwith their subjects. History shows, however, that the monarchs regarded these\nagreements much as some nations today regard treaties. When, under force of\ncircumstances, kings were compelled to submit to greater force, as in the case\nof John at Runnymede, they signed anything that was put before them; but,\nas soon as the danger was over, they forgot their promises and acted as though\nthey had never given them.\nIn their endeavors to raise money, to reward favorites, and for other reasons,\nsucceeding English monarchs thus granted many patents that became burden\nsome to the people. One person would be given the exclusive right to engage\nin a certain industry, such as tanning; another to trade in soap, salt, starch,\nsaltpeter, leather, paper or glass; another to buy and sell iron or steel; and still\nanother to import certain articles; and so on. Sometimes the monopoly covered\ntrade in all England; at other times, the sale of a particular article in a partic\nular region. As the activities so monopolized had previously been free to the\npublic, the only result was to raise prices which must be paid by the many, that\nthe favored patentees might be enriched.\nIn the fall of 1601, in response to protests, Queen Elizabeth I proclaimed that\nif any of her subjects felt aggrieved or wronged by reason of any of these patent\ngrants, he could test the validity of the patent in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe very next spring, 1602, one Edward D'Arcy brought suit for infringement of\nhis patent grant for making and importing playing cards. The justification for\nthe patent grant had been based upon grounds of public policy, that unless the\ngrant existed subjects who might better \"go to plow did employ themselves in\nthe art of making cards8.\" This is the famous Case of Monopolies. Though the\ncourt held the monopoly on playing cards to be invalid, the case has come down\nthe ages as recognizing the existence of something most important, namely the\nline of division between what is proper and what is improper subject matter for\na patent \"monopoly.\" To quote from the decision,\nWhere any man by his own charge and industry or by his own wit\nor invention doth bring any new trade into the Realm of any Engine\ntending to the furtherance of a trade that never was used before;\nAnd that for the good of the Realm; That in such cases the King\nmay grant to him a monopoly patent for some reasonable time until\nthe subjects may learn the same, in consideration of the good that\nhe doth bring by his Invention to the Commonwealth; otherwise not.\nThis has been the law in England up to the present time. One can still\nobtain a patent in Great Britain, not merely for an invention that he has made,\nbut also for a new article or idea imported from outside the realm.\n8D'Arcy v. Allen, 11 Coke 86 (1602), known as the Case of Monopolies.\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nNotwithstanding the D'Arcy decision, the very next monarch, James I, who\nascended the throne in 1603, granted more monopolies than ever, including some\nfor silk and even inns. The cry against harmful monopolies in Great Britain\naccordingly grew in vigor, until, finally, by the Statute of Monopolies in 1623,\nParliament deprived the sovereign completely of this prerogative.\nThe Statute of Monopolies made an exception, however, in favor of patents\nfor inventions - the very same exception that the judges had indicated in the\nD'Arcy case, and which was really, in effect, declaratory of the common law, i.\ne., that no special privilege would be granted for \" . . . any letters patent and\ngrants of privilege for the term of fourteen years or under hereafter to be made\nof the sole working or making of any manner of new manufacture within this\nRealm to the true and first inventor and inventors of such manufactures which\nother at the time of making of such letters patent and grants shall not use so\nas also they be not contrary to the law nor mischievous to the State by raising\nprices of commodities at home or hurt of trade or generally inconvenient9.\"\nBoth the English and the American laws of patents10 come directly from\nthis exception for inventions, and the very provision quoted above still exists as\nSection 6 of the present British Statute of Monopolies.\nThe American colonists were fully acquainted with patents, and knew their\nvalue under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Statute of Monopolies.\nLike the mother country, several of the colonies, prior to the Constitutional\nConvention, had granted patents in the endeavor to introduce industries. The\npatents were not necessarily for new inventions, but sometimes for old industries,\nif brought in from abroad, and also for fostering those struggling for survival.\nThe encouragement of industries was achieved not only by the grant of monop\nolies in special enactments of the local legislature, corresponding to the English\ngrants from the Crown, but also through the medium of premiums, bounties,\nand the like.\nFully aware, when granting these perquisites, of the monopolistic evils in\nthe country whence they had come, the colonists took precautions against a\nrepetition of those evils. For example, the Massachusetts General Court (the\ncolonial legislature) in 1641 enacted that \"There shall be no monopolies granted\nor allowed among us, but of such new inventions as are profitable to the country,\nand that for a short time.\" Connecticut had a similar provision. Massachusetts,\nConnecticut, Virginia, South Carolina, New York, and other colonies granted\na number of patents covering different methods of making salt, some invented\nand others imported, and sometimes on condition that saltworks be established\nwithin a limited time. Similar patents covering the exclusive manufacture of\nother articles, and often on similar conditions, were granted by the colonists.\nThese included the manufacture of iron and of machinery, a sawmill, a grain\nmill, and a tobacco pipe factory.\nThe first patent granted by the Massachusetts General Court, pursuant to\nthe enactment of 1641, was one to Samuel Winslow (1641) for a novel method\n9Statute of Monopolies, 21 Jac. I, C.3 (1623).\n10Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 327, 328; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co.,\n243 U.S. 502, 510, 511.\n\nCreate or Perish\nof making salt. The first machinery patent granted by the same body was to\nJoseph Jenkes, in 1646, for a scythe-manufacturing mill. In 1667, Massachusetts\noffered a fifteen-year monopoly to anyone who would build a dry dock, and, the\noffer apparently not proving sufficiently attractive, the term of years was in\ncreased in the following year to twenty-one. Several of the colonies continued to\ngrant patents, even after they became states upon the adoption of the Constitu\ntion. New York, for example, issued one to Livingston and Fulton covering the\nexclusive right to operate steamboats in New York waters, a patent later an\nnulled by Chief Justice Marshall as being in violation of the interstate-commerce\nclause of the Constitution.\nThe delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, fully familiar with\nall the circumstances, desired to provide the new nation with the benefits of\na patent system.\nBoth James Madison of Virginia and Charles Pinckney of\nSouth Carolina, therefore, proposed that Congress be given certain powers in\nthat direction. Madison's proposal was that it should have power: \"To secure to\nliterary authors their copyrights for a limited time. To encourage by premiums\nand provisions, the advance of useful knowledge and discoveries.\"\nParenthetically, the Atomic Energy Commission is doing the very thing to\nday that Madison suggested so long ago\n. Certain types of inventions deal\ning with the production of fissionable material and atomic weapons cannot be\npatented under the exclusion provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. An inventor\nmay, however, make a claim for remuneration for his contribution, and, un\nder certain standards that have been set up, may be awarded a sum of money\nby the Commission. From a study of the unclassified awards and experience\nwith the AEC, some authorities believe that the Constitutional founders were\nmost wise in rejecting Madison's proposal. They are convinced that the failure\nof the nuclear program to get off the ground more rapidly and extensively, in\nthe way and to the same degree that our free-enterprise inventive efforts with\nother nongovernment-controlled programs have historically blossomed for the\ncommon good, may be due, in part, to the inadequacy of this kind of so-called\nincentive.\nCharles Pinckney disliked Madison's proposal that the government should\nevaluate and pay out sums of money for inventions. His own proposal was that\nCongress should have the power \"to grant patents for useful inventions.\nTo\nsecure to authors exclusive rights for a certain time.\" Under this concept, the\ncompetitive industrial marketplace would determine the value of an invention.\nAs it emerged from committee and as adopted by the Convention, the Con\nstitution provided, and still provides, in Article I, Section 8, that Congress shall\nhave power: \"To promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by secur\ning for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their\nrespective Writings and Discoveries.\"\nPursuant to this provision, Congress could have granted to a person who\nmakes a scientific discovery the exclusive right to his own discovery. The Con\n1142 U.S.C. 2187 (Sec. 157). (The abbreviation U.S.C. refers to the United States Code -\na collected body of federal law.)\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nstitution uses the words \"Science,\" \"exclusive right,\" \"discoveries 12.\" As will\nbe made evident, however, Congress has provided for exclusive rights only in\ncases of certain kinds of advances and not for scientific discoveries per se.\nThis provision is the only one in the whole Constitution which relates to the\ncreation of private property rights and was intended to promote the progress of\nscience and the useful arts. It rested on the great tradition and philosophy of\nour capitalistic system - the granting of limited protection to the individual in\ndeveloping ideas for the benefit of the many.\nNothing, it will be noted, is said in this provision about granting patents\nas such. The word \"securing\" is used instead. Madison later explained, in the\nFederalist papers, that, though the word \"securing\" was appropriate only in\nconnection with copyrights, which had been recognized as a natural property\nright at common law, there was no reason why the same principles should not\napply to inventions: \"The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason\nto belong to the inventors. The public seems with equal reason to belong to\nthe inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of\nindividuals.\"\nJefferson, however, declined to accept the view that inventions belonged to\ninventors as a natural right. He felt that they were for the benefit of the whole\nsociety.\nAfter the adoption of the Constitution, President Washington recommended\nlegislation in furtherance of this constitutional provision, and a statute was\nenacted by the very first Congress, in 1790. The founders of the Union thought\nthe matter so important that they provided therein that the Secretary of State\n(Thomas Jefferson), in collaboration with the Secretary of War (Henry Knox\nof Massachusetts) and the Attorney General (Edmund Randolph of Virginia),\nshould examine all patent applications, and the President and the Secretary of\nState should personally sign the patent grant. That body of three eminent men,\nJefferson, Knox, and Randolph, in effect constituted the first Patent Office of\nthis country, with Jefferson the first patent examiner, commissioner, and lawyer.\nWashington, Jefferson, and Randolph signed the first patents.\nJefferson, though, opposed to all forms of monopoly, and at first including\npatents in this category, was compelled as a result of his experience to state that\nthe patent law gave \"a spring to invention beyond my conception,\" and that,\ntherefore, \"nobody wishes more that I that ingenuity should receive a liberal\nencouragement13.\"\nBefore a patent could be issued under the law of 1790, it was necessary\nthat the application be carefully examined to determine whether the purported\ninvention, in the terms of the statute, was \"before known or used\" and whether it\nwas really \"sufficiently useful and important\" to warrant the dignity of a patent\n12There is a great doubt whether this word \"Science\" as used in the Constitution, meant\nwhat we mean today. My own study leads me to the conviction that the term \"science\" in\nthe constitutional sense, was used, rather, with philosophical and literary concepts primarily\nin mind.\n13In a letter to Oliver Evans, May 2, 1807, as given in The Writings of Thomas Jefferson,\nA. E. Bergh, Ed., 1907, Vol. 5, p. 74.\n\nCreate or Perish\nFig. 1.1: The first United States Patent Grant, July 31, 1790 (Reproduced from\nthe original in the collection of the Chicago Historical Society. This image is\npublic domain and is not protected by copyright.)\ngrant.\nBefore three years had elapsed, however, the \"sufficiently useful and\nimportant\" condition was removed from the statute, and patents were issued by\nmere registration and not by examination; but the matter was still under the\nauspices of the State Department. Chaos followed - frauds, vexatious litigations,\nmultiple conflicting patents, and so on.\nAt the urging of Senator John Ruggles of Maine, some forty-odd year later,\nthe \"American\" system of granting patents only after examination was rein\nstated by the Patent Act of 1836 , and the Patent Office was reorganized and\nestablished as a separate bureau of the State Department, with the bureau chief\nformally titled commissioner of patents. The Patent Office was subsequently\ntransferred to the Department of the Interior, upon the latter's establishment\nin 1849; and later, in 1926, it was given its present status in the Department of\nCommerce. There has long been, and still is, agitation for making the Patent\nOffice an entirely separate executive branch14 , perhaps with expanded functions\nmore suited to current national needs. But such expanded and modernized func\ntions still seem to fit in the responsibilities of the Department of Commerce.\n14Journal of the Patent Office Society, Vol. 40, pp. 10 - 17 (1958).\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\n1.1\nConclusion\nIt is important to note that the historical purposes that lay behind our patent\nsystem were primarily concerned with the matter of innovation and not bald\ninvention alone.\nThe object was not merely to grant patents; rather it was to encourage the\nfew inventive minds among us to take the risks inherent in introducing new\nproducts and arts or processes into the stream of commerce, for the ultimate\nbenefit of the many.\nThis encouragement took the form of a contract: the\nsovereign offering the inventor limited protection against copying in return for\nthe publication of the details of his invention; and it rested upon the theory,\nnow ironically applied more effectively by the Soviets than by us, that rewards\nto the individual benefit the public at large.\nAn additional purpose was to prevent, through the publication of inventions\nin patents, a recurrence of loss of arts such as had happened formerly when\nknowledge was handed down from father to son secretly.\nBut whether today's patent system in America, its administration and its\ntreatment by the judiciary, is an effective stimulus to innovation, has become a\nquestion of the utmost importance and urgency.\nDoes the system offer that kind of security to the inventor and his backers\nthat stimulates ready embarkation upon the risky road of innovation?\nDo its rewards stimulate the myriad engineers who, as a condition of their\nemployment in much of industry and government, have assigned to their em\nployers all their rights to any inventions they may make?\nHas its use in certain large corporate quarters been reduced largely to de\nfensive and cross-licensing needs, as distinguished from protecting an exclusive\nposition as a stimulus to innovation?\nAre we today really worried about \"lost arts\"?\nDoes the system promote the progress of useful military, nuclear, and space\narts?\nIn short, has our patent system been largely reduced in many fields to the\ngranting of papers with red seals - mostly form and little substance?\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 2\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the\nCourts\nFor the benefit of readers unfamiliar with the details of patent appli\ncation prosecution and judicial review, the role of the Patent Office\nand courts is herein summarized.\nIn view of the multiple-function purpose of this book and diversity of back\ngrounds of its hoped-for readers, a brief review is in order of the processes\ninvolved in filing and prosecuting patent applications in the Patent Office and\nthe role of the courts of the land in patent litigation. This chapter, obviously,\nwill be of little interest for those knowledgeable in this field.\nPerhaps an interesting way to trace the procedure would be to stand in the\nshoes of an imaginary independent inventor in the first flush of success in the\ncompletion of an invention. In order to obtain a patent for it, he must submit\nfor examination by the Patent Office a detailed description that, by law, must\nbe in a certain subscribed form and be couched in legal terminology generally\nquite foreign to those who produce inventions as well as to nonlegal persons\nin general. The patent application itself must contain a clear and concise de\nscription of the invention (termed here the specification), usually with reference\nto drawings illustrating a preferred form of the device, and a set of succinct\nterminal paragraphs, called claims, setting forth the features of novelty which\nthe inventor and his attorney believe the Patent Office should allow as defining\nthe scope of the patent grant.\n2.1\nThe Nature of the Patent Office\nIt will be remembered that the Constitution authorized Congress to promote\nthe progress of useful arts by securing to inventors for limited periods of time\nthe exclusive rights to their discoveries. It has previously been pointed out,\nhowever, that, apart from a few questionably-handled procedures, as under\nthe compensation provisions of the Atomic Energy Act or the Space Act, pure\nscientists have not been rewarded by Congress. Instead, the latter has seen fit\nto enact patent laws applicable to the applied scientist and engineer, who takes\n\nCreate or Perish\nthe discoveries of the pure scientist and makes useful arts out of them. In 1952,\nCongress codified the patent laws, adding, however certain modifications that\npurported to eliminate or at least curb the disposition of some courts to strike\ndown patents as a matter of social philosophy.\nThe statute itself defines the structure of the Patent Office and the mode\nof its operation, charging the commissioner of patents with the responsibility\nfor the examination of every patent application and for the issuance of every\npatent (and trademark). Thus the Patent Office must maintain a vast up-to-date\ntechnical library, otherwise the patent examiners assisting the commissioner will\nnot have the facilities for making reasonably thorough investigations.\nThe commissioner is further assisted by an appellate board in the Patent\nOffice, termed the Board of Appeals. The members of the Board, like the com\nmissioner, are appointed by the president and are given the title of examiners\nin-chief. Their function is primarily to pass on final rejections by the examining\ncorps which deny the patentability of the claimed inventions. Fortunately, they\nare selected from the experienced ranks of the Patent Office personnel and are\nnot, as yet, purely political appointees.\nBefore our inventor's newly filed patent application is examined for novelty, it\nis screened by classification examiners to determine whether the subject matter\nproperly relates to the class of inventions handled by a particular group of\nskilled examiners. Since, however, applications are normally examined in the\norder received, and since there is, on the average, a year's backlog of cases, our\ninventor will probably have to wait that long before his application is reached.\nWhen the examiner assigned to the case reaches the application, he (or\nshe) studies it with particular attention to the claims of novelty which he is\nrequested to allow. These claims, if allowed, represent the metes and bounds or\nscope of the patent grant. The examiner then goes to the division files of patents\nand publications, which are broken down into many thousands of classes and\nsubclasses, and starts his search. He is looking for the prior art that is closest to\nthe concept claimed to be new. He looks not only for the exact device described\nin the application, but also for others similar to it. If the patent attorney in\nthe case has made his own search before filing the application and failed to find\nan exact anticipation, it is likely that the examiner will not find one either.\nHowever, even if the invention is not found in any prior patent or publication,\nbut is the kind of thing that any mechanic skilled is the art could easily evolve\nfrom what is in a prior patent or publication, the device is not patentable.\nHaving completed his search, the examiner usually takes the course of re\njecting the application on the basis of the closest prior art that he was able\nto find. There is a very definite reason for this. Being a conscientious public\nservant, the examiner is not disposed to hand out patents unless he is convinced\nthat a really new invention has been made 1 . By rejecting the case, he puts the\nburden of proof on the applicant to explain why the latter should be granted a\n1If our judiciary could only experience, as practicing lawyers, the difficulty involved in\nsuccessfully prosecuting a patent application in the Patent Office, their respect for patents\nwould undoubtedly increase\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\npatent although others may have come as close to his purported invention as in\nthe prior art cited by the examiner.\nThe attorney for the applicant must then reply within six months of the\nexaminer's rejection, pointing out why the prior art is not pertinent to his\nclient's claim of novelty, and, if the original claims did not clearly define that\nnovelty, appropriately amending those claims.\nThis process of rejection (or\npartial rejection) and amendment or argument continues until the examiner\nfeels that an issue has been reached. In some cases, the examiner will allow the\namended claims or, upon reconsideration, the original claims, or some of them,\nand the patent will thereupon be granted and will take its place among over\nthree million United States patents. In other cases, the examiner will not be\npersuaded as to the matter of invention. The applicant's attorney insists; the\nexaminer is adamant that there is no invention and makes his rejection final.\nSometimes the attorney will interview the examiner in person. He may then\nask the primary examiner to review the assistant's decisions. At a conference,\nthe assistant examiner gives the primary examiner his reasons for rejection,\nand the attorney presents his side of the case, perhaps with the help from the\ninventor himself. The primary examiner then makes his decision. If he agrees\nwith the attorney, he overrules his assistant and allows the application so that\nthey patent may issue. If, on the other hand, he feels that the assistant is right,\nhe will not overrule him, but will suggest that the attorney turn to the Board\nof Appeals.\nThe attorney, in the latter event, files a brief before the Board in which\nhe describes the history of the case, the nature and details of the invention,\nthe meaning of the rejected claims, the prior art cited by the examiner upon\nwhich the adverse ruling was based, and the reasons, factual and legal, why the\nattorney considers the examiner to be in error. The examiner then files a reply\nbrief presenting his views, and the case may be decided by the Board of Appeals\non these two briefs alone. An oral argument may, however, be requested. The\nattorney will appear before the Board to argue his case, but the examiner from\nwhom the appeal is taken usually does not appear at the hearing.\nThe Board may then sustain the examiner's rejection, or overrule it and\norder the patent to be granted. Sometimes the Board finds that, while it cannot\nsustain the examiner's position, the claims are not patentable for reasons other\nthan those advanced by the examiner. In such an event, it will offer its own\ngrounds for rejection, permitting the applicant to modify his claims in order to\novercome the new objections or to ask for reconsideration of the new grounds.\nWhenever two or more applicants are claiming the same invention, \"inter\nference\" examiners are assigned the task of trying to determine who is actually\nthe first inventor. Testimony is usually taken before a notary public or court\nofficer, subject to cross-examination, and other evidence of invention activities\nsubmitted by the conflicting applicants. Aided by these, as well as by briefs and\noral argument, a Board of Patent Interferences makes a decision as to who is\nthe prior inventor.\nThe commissioner cannot by himself, of course, decide or give attention to\nthe administration of all these matters. He therefore has several assistant com\n\nCreate or Perish\nmissioners of patents. And, parenthetically, lest it be considered that Russians\nare the only ones who utilize the talents of women in technical fields, we have\nrecently been ably served by a lady assistant commissioner of patents on matters\nregarding trademarks.\n2.2\nPatent Office Problems\nWhen there is a rapid turnover in the examining crops because of attractive\noffers from outside organizations, particularly to the younger examiners, the\nbacklog of cases obviously mounts. The effectiveness and utility of the whole\npatent system are thereby damaged. Perhaps the greater administrative prob\nlems facing the Patent Office, therefore, are, first convincing the public and\nCongress of the importance of its functions; and, second, the urgent necessity\nfor promptly dignifying the position of examiner so that it will attract competent\ncareer men and women.\nAutomation in the form of electronic computers may come to help in the\nsearching process. Indeed, an interesting experiment for facilitating the exam\niner's search in certain limited chemical cases by computer techniques is under\nway.\nWhether sufficient time and money will ever be provided to effect the copious\ncross-referencing in the electrical and electronic fields, as well as in the mechani\ncal fields, necessary for the employment of computers in the task of searching, is\na real question. An inventor who files an application for a new vacuum tube, for\nexample, might find anticipation of his tube tucked away in a prior patent for a\nradio-receiver circuit, in which prior patent the very same tube might have been\nshown incidentally, but not claimed as part of the invention. The disclosure of\nthe earlier tube would, however, be a bar to patenting the new one. Unless the\ninformation was entered into the computer that this tube construction was dis\nclosed, though not claimed, in the radio-receiver patent, it will not be furnished\nby the computer. Today, however, an examiner, in scanning a patent, can notice\nsuch incidental disclosures not predicted by the title or normal classifications of\nthe patent.\nThere is, accordingly, the stupendous problem of cross-referencing the minu\ntiae and classifying every tiny component of all the combinations shown and de\nscribed in patents, if computer searching is to be successful. This is something\nthat, to some of us, looks quite impractical as yet. Classifying certain kinds of\nchemical compounds may be something else again.\nIn 1935, only 31,900 applications still awaited preliminary or further action\nby the examiners, i.e., were \"pending.\" Recently, there were almost a quarter of\na million of them 2 . And there are pending before the Board of Appeals about\n6,000 cases, and some hearings have been set for more than a year after the\nappeal was entered.\nThe problem of speeding up the granting of patents, consistent with reason\nably thorough examination and consideration, and particularly in the light of\n2Senate Report No. 1430, Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Congress, 2d\nSession (1958)\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nlimited budget and personnel, is thus still with us, though great strides have\nbeen made in keeping the Patent Office more nearly up-to-date.\n2.3\nReview of Patent Office Decisions\nSuppose the Board of Appeals concurs with the examiner that an application\ndiscloses no patentable invention, and thus decides adversely to the applicant.\nCongress has provided two alternative remedies in the nature of court review of\nsuch decision 3 .\nOne is to file a suit against the commissioner of patents in the Federal\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia 4 . The complainant may ask the\njudge to review the adverse decision of the Board of Appeals, to hear the case\nfor patentability of the invention afresh (a so-called action de novo), and to\nconsider new and more detailed evidence as to the invention underlying the\napplication and the reasons why the patent should be awarded. The District\nCourt judge will either sustain the Patent Office rejection of the application\nor, if he disagrees with the Board of Appeals, direct that a patent be issued.\nAt this trial, the commissioner is represented by his own solicitor, who cross-\nexamines the applicant's witnesses and may present witnesses on behalf of the\ncommissioner.\nFrom an adverse decision of the District Court, one may appeal to the Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A final review by way of an\nappeal petition termed \"certiorari\" may be asked of the United States Supreme\nCourt if the Court of Appeals refuses to reverse the Patent Office; but the\nSupreme Court is not apt presently to grant patents.\nIf, on the other hand, the applicant does not wish to go into Federal District\nCourt, and is well satisfied with the evidence existing in the record of the prose\ncution of the application in the Patent Office, he can alternatively appeal to the\nCourt of Customs and Patent Appeals, strictly upon that record . This court\nwas originally a so-called legislative court, set up under the provisions of Article\nI of the Constitution to serve as a tribunal of Congress, as distinguished from\nthe judicial courts of Article III, such as the Federal District Courts, Courts of\nAppeals, and the Supreme Court. Congress has recently, however, converted\nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals into a judicial court established un\nder Article III. Five judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals hear\nappeals both from customs decisions and from patent decisions. In the past,\nthese judges have not been technically trained people, though recently patent\nlawyers have been considered for the bench and appointed to it, and the Court\nis looking more and more to them with regard to appeals from the Patent Office.\nIf the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Customs\nand Patent Appeals, he has the opportunity of petitioning for certiorari to the\nUnited States Supreme Court; but, within recent years, such petitions have not\nbeen granted.\nSimilarly, when dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of\n3The same remedies apply to trademarks and design patent cases also\n435 U.S.C. 145\n535 U.S.C. 141\n\nCreate or Perish\nPatent Interferences, the losing party may appeal to the Court of Customs and\nPatent Appeals, or may bring a suit in an appropriate District Court to have\nthe Patent Office decision reversed, offering fresh testimony and evidence.\n2.4\nThe Present Mood of the Courts\nThe courts of the District of Columbia are called upon, at times, to review not\nonly the decisions of the Patent Office, but also the actions of nearly every federal\nadministrative officer or tribunal. The Federal Communications Commission\nwill award a radio station to party A rather than to party B; or the Secretary of\nthe Interior will issue a land grant or a mineral lease to one party rather than to\nanother; or the Secretary of State will deny the issuance of a passport; or some\nemployee of the Army considers that he has lost his position unjustly. Persons\ndissatisfied with many administrative decisions come to the various courts of\nthe District of Columbia each year. It is, of course, asking too much of a judge\nthat he be skilled in the technical intricacies of all the matters handled by the\nvarious administrative agencies which, indeed, are presumably staffed by experts\ntrained in the pertinent technical subject matters. Accordingly, the judge does\nnot undertake in such cases to substitute his own fact finding for that of the\nadministrative agency, except under rare circumstances. The courts have held\nvery wisely that unless there is abuse by the administrative agency, unless the\nparties had not been given a fair hearing, unless there is no substantial evidence\nto support the agency's decision, or unless that decision is unconscionable and\nclearly erroneous, a court will not upset the administrative agency's findings\neven though, considering all the evidence, it might itself have decided the fact\nissues differently. A court will of course, maintain its important function of\ninterpreting the law issues, and will readily substitute its interpretation of the\nlaw for that of the agency.\nSuits against the commissioner of patents in the District Court for the Dis\ntrict of Columbia are upon a little different footing, since the statute permits\nthe District Court to receive new evidence not before the Patent Office nor con\nsidered by it and to make a decision based upon all the facts presented. During\nthe relatively recent past, however, the Patent Office has been sustained in case\nafter case by the District Court, apparently no matter what new evidence was\noffered 6 .\nSubsequent to the recent Patent Act of 1952 , which was intended to ex\nercise a stabilizing effect upon court treatment of patents, there have been a\nnumber of reversals of the Patent Office. Some judges of the Court of Appeals\nof the District of Columbia, however, are apparently still hostile, as indicated\nby dissenting Judge Danaher :\nThe philosophy permeating the majority opinion basically is one\n6Attention is invited to the anomaly (unless one recognizes the hostility to patents) of the\ncourt's giving such great weight to the Patent Office findings of no invention when it has\ndeclined to grant a patent, and such little weight to its findings of invention and the resulting\nstatutory presumption of validity in suits for infringement of patents granted by it\n7Watson v. Bersworth, 727 O.G. 445, 251 F. 2d 898.\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nof nullification of the remedy provided by Congress, a result hear\nreached (1) by according to the Patent Office the equivalent of a\nconclusive presumption of correctness; and (2) by holding that suffi\nciently of disclosure raises a question of law. Relegated to zero status\nis the District Court, with its finding, its conclusions, its memoran\ndum opinion and its judgment. Judge Wilkin heard many witnesses,\nhad the benefit of charts and exhibits, received detailed explanations\nas to the points in issue and possessed the advantage of colloquy with\nthe opposing counsel. The record discloses close and careful atten\ntion to the many aspects of the case brought under 35 U.S.C. 145\nwhich permits a dissatisfied applicant to pursue his remedy in the\nDistrict Court with may adjudge the applicant entitled to receive a\npatent \"as the facts of the case may appear.\"\nWe recently pointed out that under governing case law and the Fed\neral Rules, even as to patent cases, \"a finding of fact by the District\nCourt, sitting without jury, may be set aside on appeal only if it is\nclearly erroneous.\" We noted that in such situations we are bound to\ninquire whether the District Court's findings are clearly erroneous.\nHere, no effort is made by the majority to demonstrate that Judge\nWilkin's findings are \"clearly wrong\" or \"clearly erroneous.\" They\nare simply are peremptorily spurned as meaningless and nugatory in\nthe context of the majority's treatment of the problem. I shall later\nundertake to show that the District Judge, with thorough conviction,\narrived at his amply supported findings on the new evidence before\nhim. I fail to see how we could have otherwise than he did.\nAnd, more recently, Judge Burger of the Court of Appeals for the District\nof Columbia stated that, while he was \"compelled\" to follow the \"present state\nof the decisions\" in sustaining the Patent Office holding of no invention, he felt\nthat those decisions\nimpose barriers to patents far more stringent than contemplated\neither in the first instance by the Constitution or later by Congress\n8 .\nJudge Burger continued,\nThis case illustrates, to me, the inhospitable attitude toward patents.\nstemming in part from our natural aversion to monopolies. From\nthe premise that monopolies are bad, it is argued that patents being\nmonopolies are at least suspect. But a patent is a monopoly primar\nily in a technical dictionary sense, much as is ownership of land, and\nwe ought not let our reason be clouded by semantics.\nThis lack of hospitality toward patents is suggested in the argument,\nsometimes made here by counsel for the Patent Office, that Buck\n8Boehringer Sohn v. Watson, 256 F. 2d 712, 714.\n\nCreate or Perish\nRogers comic strips which depict rockets, jets, and the space age\nwill no doubt operate and be cited as \"anticipation\" of some patent\napplications for such devices as the fertile brain of the cartoonist de\npicts for the children. It appears that unrestrained imagination, un\nburdened by any responsibility for the hard, patient and painstaking\nwork of development, car bar future patent protection for the men\nand women who actually implement and carry out the prediction\nand prophecies of the Buck Rogers comic strips and the \"Fantastic\nStories\" of the paperback trade. Indeed, Patent Office counsel advice\nus that Rube Goldberg cartoons have been used for this same pur\npose. This hardly seems the way to encourage maximum incentive\nfor those engaged in research and invention. This could mean that\nwidespread research and experimentation in these areas might well,\nby economic necessity or default, ultimately become a Government\nmonopoly.\nWe can hope, accordingly, that the remedy in the federal courts, intended by\nCongress to grant relief from improper Patent Office decision, will ultimately be\ninterpreted to have been restored by the Patent Act of 1952 to patent applicants.\n2.5\nThe Reports of Patent Office and Court Decisions\nScientists have their journals describing the latest advances in the various tech\nnological fields. Similarly, lawyers have the reports of the various administrative\nlaw tribunals, such as the Patent Office, and of the courts, containing decisions\nin litigated cases that illustrate the current legal interpretations placed upon the\nvarious statutes and regulations, as well as how various types of factual situa\ntions are currently treated by such tribunals and courts. From these decisions,\nas thus reported, a lawyer, through the process of analogy, tries to answer a\nclient's questions as to whether or not his invention is patentable, and what his\nlegal rights may be in various situations.\nIn its weekly Official Gazette, the Patent Office publishes, in addition to\nregulations, rules, notices, and reports of interesting Patent Office or court de\ncisions, a brief notice of every patent that has been granted during the week.\nThat notice includes a typical drawing from the patent application, where ap\npropriate, and a typical claim, perhaps representative of the scope of the patent\ngrant\n. Since the \"claims\" set forth the metes and bounds, or limits, of the\nexclusive privilege for which the patent was granted, an attorney, by scanning\nthe Official Gazette, may learn of recent patent grants in the fields with which\nhis clients are concerned, for the purpose both of keeping up to date and of\nlearning of possible conflict with the client's competitors.\nPatents are classified in the Official Gazette as general and mechanical\npatents, chemical patents, and electrical patents. Design patents, also granted\n9The United States Patent Quarterly (U.S.P.Q.) also contains Patent Office and court\ndecisions bearing upon patents, trademarks, copyrights, unfair competition, antitrust matters,\nand the like; and, as later discussed, federal court decisions on all subjects, including patents,\nare also contained in other reports\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nby the Patent Office for new and ornamental esthetic designs of various kinds\nof items, are also reported.\nIn addition, the Official Gazette publishes trademarks that the Patent Office\nproposes to register, to enable anyone who considers that such registration may\nhurt him to file an opposition to it. A trademark is a mark (such as a symbol\nor word or the like) that a party in business adopts and uses in connection with\nhis products or services. It serves to associate these products or services, in\nthe public mind, with the business entity that is the source or their origin -\n\"Ivory,\" for example, as used on soap by Procter and Gamble. Unlike a patent,\na common-law trademark is not obtained by registering it in the Patent Office,\nbut merely by adopting and using it. However, federal registration of a mark,\nused in interstate commerce, provides, among other benefits, certain procedural\nadvantages in enforcing the mark against infringers, and in obtaining trademark\nregistrations in certain foreign countries.\nI have dwelt briefly on this matter because there is today, in some quarters,\nrenewed interest in the proposal that the Patent Office similarly publish in its\nGazette, for opposition, its intention to grant patents. The theory is that if\nthe public can oppose the granting of a patent by calling to the attention of the\nexaminer some reasons why it should not be issued - such as a prior art that the\nexaminer may have overlooked - the courts should give more than lip service to\nthe present statutory presumption of the validity of a patent grant, discussed\nlater, because the public had its chance to disprove the allegation of invention\nbefore the patent was issued.\nIn Chapter 6, I shall analyze a series of proposals for remedial legislation,\nincluding the matter of oppositions, which, for reasons later presented, I now\nbelieve more likely to be detrimental than helpful to the American patent sys\ntem.\n2.6\nA Further Role of the Courts - Infringement Suits\nLet us assume that a patent has been granted by the Patent Office. This office\nthen loses jurisdiction of the patent, with a few minor exceptions. The next\ntribunal before which a patent may come is the federal District Court. How\ndoes this come about?\nSomebody starts to \"infringe\" the patent. This may mean that someone\nother than the owner or a licensee under the patent makes, uses, or sells (or\ninduces the making, using, or selling of) the invention in violation of the patent\nholder's right to exclude others from manufacturing, using, or selling it. (A\n\"licensee\" is one who has obtained, by suitable contract with the patent holder\nor one authorized to act for him, a license or right to manufacture, use, or\nsell the invention with the assurance that he shall be immune from suit by the\npatent holder.\nUsually some kind of license fee, often termed a royalty and\nfrequently based upon a percentage of the business involving the invention that\nthe licensee may do, is involved in the license contract.)\nWhen the patent holder learns about the action, he demands that the person\ninvolved cease and desist from his infringement and account for past infringe\n\nCreate or Perish\nment or, if the patent holder is prepared to grant him a license, negotiate such\na license.\nSuppose the infringer declines to stop infringing or to negotiate a license. The\npatent then serves, in the words of the late Professor George Washington Pierce\nof Harvard University, as \"a license to bring a law suit.\" The patent holder has\nthe legal right to file a complaint in the federal District Court where the infringer\nresides or where the infringer is both doing business and committing his acts\nof infringement, requesting the court to issue an injunction prohibiting further\ninfringement and to award damages to the patent holder for this unlicensed use\nof his invention.\nThe defendant-infringer must file an answer to the complaint, setting forth\nhis reasons for defying the plaintiff's patent rights. Usually, he will list earlier\nsimilar patents or publications and refer to earlier alleged inventors or users of\nthe invention covered by the patent, in the hope that, at the trial, he will be able\nto convince the court that no real advance had been made over what had been\ndone before, of sufficient scope to warrant a patent grant, and so the Patent\nOffice erred in issuing the patent. The defendant also usually offers reasons\nwhy his product, in view of certain differences in construction, should not be\nconsidered an infringement of the precise invention described and claimed in the\npatent. Other defenses may also be offered.\nI ought to mention, however, another important defense that is sometimes\nappropriate, namely, that the patent holder is misusing his patent in violation\nof our antitrust laws (including restraining or conspiring to restrain trade) 10 .\nHe may have required certain illegal restrictions, such as forcing the licensee to\npurchase unpatented items for him, a restriction outside the scope of the actual\nlegal right, privilege, or \"monopoly\" (using the latter term in a loose sense)\nafforded by the patent grant.\nThe defendant also customarily attacks the patent by way of a counterclaim,\nupon the same grounds used in defending a suit for infringement. He asks the\ncourt to issue a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid or otherwise\nunenforceable, or that the defendant's products are not infringements. In this\nway, should the plaintiff withdraw his suit, the defendant's counterclaim will\nstill be before the court for adjudication.\nThe complain, the answer, and the counterclaim are the customary docu\nments filed in the ordinary run-of-the-mill patent suit.\nBy the time the case comes to trial, the judge has usually required the\ndefendant to narrow down the list of allegedly prior art patents, publications,\nand uses that he is going to rely upon as anticipatory of the invention. At the\nsame time, the judge has required the plaintiff to state the dates of invention\nwhich he is trying to prove, and the particular claims on which he rests his case.\nThe judge then hears the case.\nThe plaintiff, usually with the aid of a\ntechnical expert, such as an engineer or scientist familiar with the field of the\ninvention, explains to the court what the patent covers, translating engineer\ning and technical terms and concepts into layman's language. He explains the\n10Such as the Clayton and Sherman Acts.\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nproblem that this invention is supposed to solve, and then offers evidence as\nto what the defendant is doing and why this constitutes infringement of the\npatent claims. The plaintiff then rests his case. Why? Because our law says\nthat a patent is presumed to be valid; that is, the process of examination in the\nPatent Office has given the patent an aura of being valid under the law. This\nmeans that the defendant has the burden of proving that the patent is not valid.\nAnd here the law, at least in theory, imposes upon the defendant a very heavy\nburden. The plaintiff has presented what is termed a prima-facie case, and it\nis incumbent upon the defendant to proceed with his proofs. However, in the\nevent that the defendant overcomes, by his evidence, the plaintiff's prima facie\ncase, the ultimate burden of proof of validity rests with the plaintiff.\nThe defendant may call his technical expert to the stand to explain the dis\nclosures of the prior patents or publications (and also prior uses) before referred\nto, trying to convince the judge that the invention was either previously dis\nclosed or publicly used, or that, contrary to the patent examiner's view, any\nindividual skilled in the art (as distinguished from an expert) would know how\nto make this invention. The plaintiff may, of course, cross-examine the defen\ndant's witnesses. When the defendant has completed his defense, the plaintiff\nhas an opportunity to rebut.\nThe judge must then make a decision.\nHe studies the subsequently filed\nbriefs of the parties and the transcript of the testimony, makes up his mind,\nand writes a decision. The federal rules of civil procedure require that he make\nspecific findings of fact and conclusions of law, with regard to the validity and\ninfringement of the patent. He must present his findings in writing.\nThese patent decisions and other decisions in all fields of the federal District\nCourts are reported in a series of volumes known as the Federal Supplement,\nwhich is abbreviated as \"F. Supp.,\" with the volume number as a prefix and\nthe page number as a suffix.\nThe trial judge's decision, however, is not final. He is but the first rung of\nan echelon. The losing party has a right to appeal from his decision to a Circuit\nCourt of Appeals. A circuit is a geographic area generally comprising a few\nstates. The First Circuit, for example, is composed of Massachusetts, Maine,\nNew Hampshire, Rhode Island, and the possession of Puerto Rico. The Court\nof Appeals for the First Circuit sits in Boston, and hears appeals from all of\nthe federal District Courts in its circuit. In all, there are ten circuits plus the\nDistrict of Columbia.\nThe Courts of Appeals customarily sit in panels of three judges, and review\nthe District Courts' decisions, sustaining the trial judges or reversing them, as\nthe case may be. The decisions of the Courts of Appeals are reported in the\nFederal Reporter, abbreviated \"F.,\" for a first series of volumes, and \"F. 2d\" for\nthe present second series.\nSitting above these Courts of Appeals is the Unites States Supreme Court.\nA party losing a patent appeal in a Court of Appeals does not have an absolute\nright to heard by the United States Supreme Court. Under Article III of the\nConstitution, the Supreme Court must, in theory, take certain kinds of cases,\nbut these do not include patent appeals.\nThe losing party must, according,\n\nCreate or Perish\npetition the Supreme Court by way of the before-mentioned petition for a writ\nof certiorari, asking the Court, in its discretion, to review the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals.\nThe Supreme Court grants very, very few such writs. It is more likely to\ngrant certiorari in a vitally important case involving large companies than in\nthe case of smaller companies, or individual litigants, even though the issues\nmay be the same.\nRecent past experience has been that when a Court of Appeals sustained\na patent, there was likelihood that the Supreme Court would grant certiorari,\nand then proceed to destroy the patent. Where a Court of Appeals has thrown\nout the patent, however, there is no case in modern times of which I am aware\nwhere the Supreme Court granted certiorari to reinstate it.\nThe decisions of the Supreme Court are reported in several different volumes,\none of which is the United States Reports, abbreviated as \"U.S.\" I shall, for\ninstance, later refer to the Bell Telephone Cases, which are reported at 126 U.S.\nAnyone desiring to find the decisions of trial and appellate courts, accord\ningly, may consult the Federal Supplement, Federal Reporter, and United States\ndecisions (or, in the case of patents and related fields, the United States Patent\nQuarterly), and he will find there exactly what reasons were advanced by the\nvarious courts for sustaining or destroying patents.\nWith the aid of these reported past decisions, a lawyer can try to instruct\nhis client as to the expression and application of the law by the courts, and so\nmap out a procedure to meet his client's situation.\n\nChapter 3\nThe Patent Law\nWhile the classes of patentable inventions and statutory restrictions\nare readily set forth, with illustrative cases, the question of what\nis \"obvious\" and what is \"invention\" under the 1952 Patent Act is\nunsettled . This chapter accordingly concludes with a discussion of\nthis vital question which the Supreme Court has thus far refused to\nhear. Here are presented the author's views based, in part, upon\nthe current very real role played in American innovation by the in\ndependent inventor.\nThere must, clearly, be a set of rules or norms by means of which to establish\nthe various kinds of invention (using that word in its popular sense for the\nmoment) that may be patentable or, at least, the circumstances under which\npublic policy requires that a patent may not be granted.\nAs noted earlier, Congress set forth, in the Patent Act of 1952, a codifica\ntion of our patent laws, restating the substance of prior statutes and adopting\nconstructive court-made law established prior to the 1930's. But, in addition,\nit introduced changes in the law primarily directed at curbing the damage to\nthe patent system effected by recent destructive policies of the Supreme Court.\nIncluded in these curbs are the abolition of the doctrine of \"flash of genius 1\"\nas the test for invention, later discussed, and the loose and ready invalidation\nof patent claims as defining the invention functionally, instead of structurally.\n3.1\nClasses of Patentable Invention\nThe 1952 Act was passed pursuant to the previously discussed Constitutional\nprovision in Article I, Section 8, empowering Congress to promote the progress of\nuseful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their\ndiscoveries. Two words are used here: \"inventors\" and \"discoveries.\" While\ninvention and discovery may involve different concepts to the linguist, in patent\nlaw, they had previously meant the same thing and been used synonymously.\nThe first provision of the 1952 Act, Section 100, thus sets forth that \"the term\n1Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., 214 U.S. 84, 91 (1941)\n\nCreate or Perish\n'invention' means invention or discovery.\" As explained before, the word \"dis\ncovery\" does not include the bald discovery of a scientific principle, and the\ndefinition in Section 100 appears to limit the word to mean only \"invention,\"\nas that term had been used in prior court decisions.\nThe statute then proceeds to define various classes of invention - listing a\nprocess, a machine, a manufacture, a composition of matter, or a material. Some\nof these words are a little bit out-of-date today, but they came from the very\nearly patent acts when the only appropriate term to describe an invention was a\n\"machine\" or a \"manufacture.\" In our modern vernacular, a \"machine\" is hardly\ndescriptive of an electronic component or circuit; but the courts, following the\nlead of prior Supreme Courts and the actual desires and intentions of Congress,\ncontinue to use this older language of the statutes. Thus, a piece of apparatus\nthat achieves a useful result functionally is a \"machine,\" and an item that can\nbe produced or manufactured by a machine is an article \"manufacture.\" As an\nillustration, apparatus for weaving cloth is a \"machine;\" the cloth, when woven,\nis a \"manufacture.\"\nThe term \"composition of matter\" is self-explanatory. If someone invents a\nnew chemical compound, that compound may be patentable. If someone else\nmerely discovers a chemical compound or element existing in nature, that is not\npatentable. Thus a claim to an electric lamp filament wire formed of ductile\ntungsten was invalidated 2 . The General Electric Company inventor, W. D.\nCoolidge, had made an important advance in a ductile-tungsten filament for\nlamps. He had accomplished this by removing impurities from tungsten as found\nin nature; but removing impurities from natural tungsten to make it ductile\nresulted only in pure tungsten, which is inherently ductile. Pure tungsten, of\ncourse, is a natural element, even if it never found pure in nature. It is interesting\nto note that the judge who invalidated this patent (Judge Morris of the District\nCourt for the District of Delaware) had himself previously sustained the patent.\nHe had not then, however, been presented with the argument that the patent\ncovered merely an element of nature in its pure state; but when so informed,\nreasoned that it could not be the subject of a \"monopoly,\" even though never\nfound pure in nature. An element is not included in the statutory classes of\ninvention.\n\"Material\" is a new word in the statute and may have a meaning very similar\nto that of \"manufacture,\" though a \"material\" may be produced by a process\nthat would not, in conventional language, necessarily be termed \"manufactur\ning.\"\n\"Process\" is defined, in part, as a \"process, art, or method.\"\nIt usually\nembraces a series of steps for accomplishing or producing a certain result. A\nchemical process is, of course, quite easy to comprehend. The next chapter,\nwhich discusses the Bell Telephone Cases, will show that there may also be an\nelectrical process.\nSuppose someone arranges the various parts of an old machine in a novel\nmanner to perform a new operation. Is this a process or method? A case of this\n2General Electric Co. v DeForest Radio Co., 28 F 2d 641.\n\nThe Patent Law\nsort came before the United States Supreme Court in connection with adjusting\nan existing metal-perforating machine so that, instead of merely perforating\nthe metal, the dies lifted the perforations out and twisted them to enlarge the\nperforations, thereby making an expanded metal sheet 3 . The defendant argued\nthat this was not within the patentable classes of invention since the original\n\"machine\" with its dies was old and thus was not patentable, and, additionally,\nthe ultimate \"manufacture\" - the expanded metal - was an old article. By this\nreasoning the inventor had not produced a new machine, a new manufacture,\nor, obviously, a new composition of matter. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court\nheld that this invention involved a new process, although, on several occasions,\nthat Court had previously intimated, by dicta, that there could not be a novel\npatentable process or method unless it involved chemical, electrical, or other\n\"elemental\" phenomena. This case, however, decided that a patentable process,\nart, or method could also involve mechanical manipulative steps: it could be a\nnew way of operating an old machine to obtain new results.\nIn addition to the definition of the term \"process\" as meaning \"process, art,\nor method,\" the Patent Act of 1952 also provides that \"process\" shall include\nA new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition\nof matter, or material.\nTo appreciate the significance of this definition, let us recall the case of Dr.\nWilliam Morton, a Boston dentist, who is credited, in some quarters, with hav\ning been the first to make the discovery, and the use of ether was immediately\nadopted. The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary and a number of other hospi\ntals, indeed, freely infringed upon Dr. Morton's patent. Suit was entered which\nfreely infringed upon Dr. Morton's patent. Suit was entered for infringement ,\nand the court found that Dr. Morton \"was entitled to be classified among the\ngreatest benefactors of mankind.\" But, the court questioned, was the claimed\ninvention a new process? No, there was no new series of steps involved. Re\nsearchers had previously inhaled ether. (Question: Had they previously inhaled\nit to the extent taught by Morton to produce the new effect of anesthesia?) Dr.\nMorton was claiming the use of ether for the purpose of anesthetization. That\nis not, said the court, a new \"art\" or \"process.\" Was it a new composition of\nmatter? Ether had been discovered before. Was it a new machine? No. Was it a\nnew manufacture? No. The court concluded, therefore, that this epoch-making\ndiscovery was not one included in the limited classes that Congress defined as\namong those patentable. So Dr. Morton's patent was thrown out.\nA discovery may be brilliant and useful, and not patentable. . . . Something\nmore is necessary. The new force or principle brought to light must\nbe embodied and set to work, and can be patented only in connection\nor combination with the means by which, or the medium through\nwhich it operates.\n3Expanded Metal Co. v. Bradford. 214 U.S. 366 (1909).\n4Morton v. New York Eye Infirmary, 17 Fed. Cas. 879, 5 Blatchf. 116 (1862)\n\nCreate or Perish\nTo cite another illustration: the citrus fruit industry had long been troubled\nwith a blue mold that formed upon citrus fruit shipped from the South.\nIt\nwas discovered that if oranges were coated with a solution of borax, specks or\ncuts in the fruit became thoroughly covered over and no formation of the mold\nwould take place. A patent was applied for and obtained by the Brogdex Co.\ncovering the product and the process for making it. It was claimed that fresh\ncitrus fruit of which the rind of skin carried borax in a very small amount is\nrendered resistant to blue mold. The American Fruit Growers infringed this\npatent and Brogdex brought suit. The district court and the court of appeals\nheld the patent valid and infringed. The Supreme Court, however, held that this\ninvention was neither a machine nor a composition of matter . It was also not\nan article of manufacture, because there was no change in form or appearance of\nthe fruit (much as Coolidge still only produced tungsten). In other words, it did\nnot belong to any of the patentable classes and could not, therefore, be protected\nby patent. As for claiming the discovery in method form, the Supreme Court\nheld that the use of borax had been known before, not for filling up small specks\nto prevent blue mold, but for preserving fruit, and the method of applying the\nborax was the same as used here (much as Dr. Morton's method of applying\nether to the nostrils was allegedly old). One could not the obtain a patent for\na new use of an old method.\nLet us assume, by way of contrast, that in the process of treating the orange\nwith borax some chemical reaction took place so that the orange was no longer\nan orange, and the borax was no longer borax. We would then have a new\ncomposition of matter - neither orange nor borax. Would this be patentable?\nA similar case occurred where it had been found that, in dyeing fur to preserve\nit, a chemical reaction took place which actually made a new preserved fiber out\nof the natural hair. It no longer had the characteristics of the natural fur. It\nno longer had the characteristics of the natural fur. Under these circumstances,\nsaid the circuit court of appeals 6 , the invention was a new article of manufacture\nand hence within the patentable classes of invention.\nOne can see, accordingly, that there is room for great latitude and inge\nnuity of argument in trying to construe a discovery as being within one of the\npatentable classes. A hostile court will not permit the law to grow with scientific\ndiscovery, whereas a court with a zeal to protect property rights in discoveries\n(under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution) can offer great encouragement\nto the promotion of progress in the useful arts.\nWe can all probably understand why Congress has not seen fit to permit\npatents to be granted for mere scientific discoveries. Something is wrong, how\never, if a practical application of such a discovery cannot be construed as being\nwithin the patentable classes of invention set forth by the Congress for that very\npurpose. Dr. Morton, for example, did not try to patent ether all over again;\nhe tried to patent its use for a particular new result. Should not that take it\nout of the category of pure scientific discovery? Congress, the engineering, sci\n5American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co., 283 U.S. 1.\n6Steinfur Patents Corp. v. William Beyer, Inc., 62 F 2d 238.\n\nThe Patent Law\nentific, and business people, and the lawyers who were responsible for the 1952\nPatent Act appear to have answered this question in the affirmative by defin\ning \"process\" to include \"a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or material.\" While the paucity of court decisions makes\nit too early to form an opinion as to the ultimate effect of this new definition,\nthe Board of Appeals of the Patent Office has already construed it to mean that\nthe new use must be one not analogous to, but radically different from, the kind\nbefore involved, and that the patent claim must be couched in the form of a\nprocess or method and not of an apparatus.\n3.2\nConditions of Patentability\nTurning, now, to the definition in the statute of patentable invention, we find\nthat Section 101 is limited to \"Whoever invents or discovers.\"\nThis means\nan individual or individuals, since a corporate body or other organizational\nentity cannot itself invent or discover. The individuals who do this creating and\nthis inventing may, however, assign their patent rights or a portion thereof, in\nwriting, to a corporation or to the government, so that a patent or a part thereof\nmay actually be owned by others than the inventor. But the application must\nbe filed in the name of the first inventor or inventors. The language provides\nthat, in this country, a patent can be issued only to the first inventor. In Great\nBritain, patents were and are granted to anyone who brings a new invention\ninto the country. The British philosophy encourages the importation as well as\ninvention of new techniques. Not so in this country, however, for if a patent\nshould be granted to someone other than a first inventor, it will be thrown out\nby the court as invalid.\nContinuing with Section 101, the inventor must invent or discover a \"new and\nuseful\" invention. The matter of the requirement for novelty has previously been\ndiscussed. As for the word \"useful,\" nearly everything has been held to be useful.\nAmong the exceptions are devices for promoting fraud or that are injurious to\nthe public health or against public policy. A \"perpetual-motion\" machine or\nany other inoperative proposal lacks utility. There are then set forth the before\nmentioned five classes of patentable invention: \"process, machine, manufacture,\nor composition of matter\" or \"material\"; and, in addition, \"any new and useful\nimprovement thereof.\" Not everyone can make a basic invention, but the law\nentitles one to seek a patent for an improvement in a machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or process.\nSection 101 also states that one may obtain a patent in the above classes,\nsubject to the requirements given in Section 102, which sets out the \"Condi\ntions for patentability, novelty and loss of right to patent.\" The Congress has\npositively declared that \"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless. . . .\" This\nappears to have been an effort (not yet successful) to curb the indiscriminate\ninvalidation of patents.\nThe first restriction is that a patent cannot be granted if the invention was\nknown or used by others in this country or patented or described in a printed\npublication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the\n\nCreate or Perish\napplicant for a patent (Section 102 [a]).\nThe inventor does not have to be\nactually aware of such prior knowledge, use, publication, or patenting, for, if\nthe invention was \"described in a printed publication\" or a prior patent was\nissued anywhere at all before he made his invention there would be an absolute\nbar to granting him a patent.\nEven if the prior patentee did not claim the\nsame inventive features, but merely \"described\" the invention adequately in a\npatent issued prior to the present inventor's concept, this description becomes\na statutory bar. This restriction demonstrates the importance of patent and\nliterature searches of both United States and foreign patents and publications\nbefore filing a patent application.\nAs for the phrase \"known or used by others in this country,\" a little history\nis in order. This was not always the law. The early patent statutes set up as\na bar to patentability knowledge or use anywhere in the world. Realizing the\nimportance of encouraging the utilization of new concepts in this country, how\never, Congress revised this to cover only prior knowledge or use in this country\n- a sore point in our current relations with foreign countries. If the invention\nwas known or used abroad but was not patented or described in a printed pub\nlication before the invention was made here, no bar exists to obtaining a patent\nin this country, provided that the inventor did not know of this knowledge or\nuse abroad. Of course, if he did know, he did not make the invention.\nThe courts have interpreted the word \"known,\" moreover, in a very strict\nsense to mean that \"an invention . . . has been completed by reduction to prac\ntice 7.\" The invention is not \"known\" if it is a prior \"conception only\" (such as\na laboratory notebook drawing or disclosure, or an unpublished manuscript), or\nif \"prior machines\" have not \"been working machines\" but \"mere experiments.\"\nEven the knowledge by individuals in this country, prior to an inventor's inven\ntion here, that a certain device had been previously used abroad successfully, is\nnot with the statutory term \"known 8.\"\nThe term \"used\" is similarly the subject matter of much court construction.\nBriefly, it means a public use 9 and not an experimental or secret use, and does\nnot include mere conceptions or abandoned experiments, such as those made\nin company laboratories or in institutions of learning and not followed up by\npublication, reduction to practice, actual public use, or patenting.\nAll of this has to do with knowledge, use, patenting, or publishing (Section\n102 [a]) before one makes an invention. There is also a time limitation. If an\napplicant waits too long, even though there is no prohibition under Section 102\n(a), he may be out of luck in view of the restriction of Section 102 (b), which\nprovides that a person shall be entitled to a patent.\nunless the invention was patented or described in a printed publica\ntion in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this\ncountry, more than one year prior to the date of the application for\n7Application of Schittler, CCPA, 234 F 2d 882, 887.\n8Doyle v. Spaulding, C.C. 19 F. 744; Westinghouse Machine Co. v. General Electric Co.,\n2 Cir., 207 F. 75, City of Milwaukee v. Activated Sludge, Inc., 7 Cir., 69 F. 2d 577.\n9Paddies, Inc. v. Broadway Dept. Stores, 147 F. Supp 373.\n\nThe Patent Law\npatent in the United States.\nEven though he may be qualified under Section 102 (a), therefore, if he does\nnot file the patent application until more than a year after publishing a thesis\nor scientific paper on the invention, he is too late to obtain a patent. If, before\nfiling, he waits more than a year after someone else has described his invention\nin a publication, again it is too late to obtain a patent. And the same is true\nif he files more than a year after his invention first went into public use or was\nput on sale.\nIn some foreign countries, it is too late to file for a patent after any docu\nment describing the invention has been made public in the country in question;\nthis is the case, for example, in Great Britain. In Germany, a description of\nthe invention in public print in any language or country, before the German\napplication is filed, bars a German patent. It is not entirely safe, therefore, to\ndelay filing until after publication to obtain foreign patent protection.\nThe last-named restrictions of Section 102 (b) in connection with \"public\nuse\" or \"sale\" are very important to the applied scientist or engineer. His new\nproducts are always going out for tests, for sale, for use; and the question arises\nas to when he should file a patent application. Perhaps one of those fundamental\ncases that partially answered this question arose in Boston in the late nineteenth\ncentury in connection with the invention of wooden paving blocks. The patent\nwas not applied for until several years after these blocks had been in use in a toll\nroad. The defendant infringed that patent, contending that it was invalid since\nthe blocks had been in public use on the street more than two years before the\ninventor had filed his patent application. (At that time, the statute provided for\ntwo years of public use instead of one year, as at present.) The Supreme Court\nfound 10 that there was no way of proving the efficacy of this invention except\nby actual test on a street, and the circumstances showed that the inventor was\nmerely trying to test whether or not the invention was any good. The Court,\naccordingly, construed this, not as a \"public use,\" but rather as an experimental\none.\nAlong came the case of a gentleman who invented steel stays for women's\ncorsets, in place of whalebone as before. He gave a sample to a lady friend\nto try out, and she used it for several years. Then the inventor filed for his\npatent. When the case reached the court, the defendant set up as a \"public\nuse\" argument the the fact that this corset had been worn for more than two\nyears before the inventor filed his patent application. The inventor, on the other\nhand, argued according to the rule of the paving-block cased before mentioned.\nThe court thereupon laid down a second important rule 11 , namely, that even a\nsingle use by a member of the public, except under such restrictions or conditions\nas would clearly delineate experimental or confidential use, constitutes a bar to\nthe granting of a patent, unless the application is filed within the statutory\nperiod. And this very rigid rule had been discovered by several companies, with\nimportant patents, much to their sorrow.\n10Elizabeth v. Pavement Co., 1877, 97 U.S. 126, 134-135.\n11Egbert v. Lippman, 104 U.S. 333.\n\nCreate or Perish\nIn a recent case\n, suit was brought for infringement of a patent dealing\nwith a process for casting patterned plastic sheets. The defendant showed that\nmore than a year before the application for patent the plaintiff had sold several\nhundred plastic sheets made by the patented process. Thereupon, the plaintiff\ninsisted that this use of the patent and sale of the product created by its process\nwere merely experimental to determine the \"production controls\" necessary for\nthe successful commercial exploitation of the patent; but the court held that\nthis constitutes a \"prior use\" within the meaning of the statute.\nThis decision points out significantly the importance of filing a patent ap\nplication not only for the new article, but also for the process involved in the\nmanufacture of the article, within a year after the first sale. The safest proce\ndure is to file before the public obtains the article, and even before it is put on\nsale. The term \"sale,\" moreover, has been interpreted by the courts to include\nan offer for sale. Thus the matter of patent protection, both for the article and\nfor the method of making it, should be very carefully explored well within the\nyear after any offer to sell or any public use.\nReturning to the restrictions in Section 102, we see that part (c) bars a patent\nif the inventor has abandoned his invention. Even if one has produced and tested\nan invention, so as to establish its so-called reduction to practice, but has put\nit away on a shelf and forgotten it, and in the meantime it is independently\ninvented by another person, he cannot prevail as the first inventor against the\nsecond person. Abandonment does not promote the useful arts, and accordingly\nit is not in accordance with our public policy to reward such inactivity. It is\nvery important, therefore, to realize that one cannot put ideas away and forget\nabout them, and then hope to resurrect early dates for them at a later time.\nThose early dates not utilized are of no avail against the diligence of others.\nSection 102 (d) relates to the effect of foreign patent filing. One must file\na separate patent application in each country in which one wishes the inven\ntion protected, though it now appears likely that a single European Economic\nCommunity patent may be established within a very few years, as discussed in\nChapter 7. Under the Universal Copyright Convention 13 , a copyright regis\ntration in one country serves also as one in the other foreign countries which\nare members of the convention. Patents, on the other hand, must be obtained\nthrough the individual patent offices of the respective countries. Section 102\n(d) provides that, if one has filed in a foreign country more than twelve months\nbefore filing in this country, and if the patent issues abroad before the filing of\nthe United States application, he is barred from obtaining a patent here.\nThis goes hand in hand, however, with a provision of a different convention\n14 , by which one may file abroad in any foreign country that is a member of\n12U.S. Chemical Corporation v. Plastic Glass Corporation, 3 Cir., 243 F. 2d 892 (1957).\n13The United States is a signatory to this 1952 Convention, implemented into our law by\nPublic Law 742, 83d Congress, effective September 16, 1955.\n14Convention of Paris for the Protection of Industrial Property of March 20, 1883, as\namended December 14, 1900 (Brussels); June 2, 1911 (Washington, D.C.); November 6, 1925\n(The Hague); June 2, 1934 (London). A further conference at Lisbon, October 6 - 31, 1958\nresulted in further amendments.\n\nThe Patent Law\nthis other convention, and thereby obtain the effective benefit of the earlier\nfiling date in the United States, provided the foreign filing is done within twelve\nmonths of the United States filing date. Similarly, foreigners may file here with\nreciprocal privileges. There is thus a year's leeway in which to decide whether\nor not to file abroad; and foreign applications claiming the convention benefits,\nif filed with that year, will be treated as if they had been filed simultaneously\nwith the United States application.\nThe United States Government, however, does not permit its citizens to file\nabroad as an absolute right. This is because of national-defense statutes. The\npatent application filed in the Patent Office is examined by Army, Air Force,\nAEC, and other personnel, assisting the commissioner of patents, to see whether\nit contains information which might jeopardize the security of the country. If\nthe answer is in the affirmative, the commissioner will issue a secrecy order,\nprohibiting any filing abroad before obtaining a license from the government to\ndo so. If, under those circumstances, one still wishes to file abroad, he may\npetition the commissioner, offering reasons why secrecy should not be required\nin the particular case. The commissioner will take up the matter with the branch\nof the service which, in the first place, considered that the invention involved\nclassified material and then a decision will be reached as to whether or not to\npermit filing abroad, and in what countries. If, however, after one has filed an\napplication, he does not hear within six months from the Patent Office that\nthe case has been put under secrecy orders, he automatically obtains a license\nto file abroad, except that special permission may be required for Iron Curtain\ncountries.\nSection 102 (e) provides that if an invention has been described in a patent\ngranted to another on an application filed before one has himself independently\nmade the same invention, there is a bar to his obtaining a patent in this country.\nIf the prior patent claims the invention, and if the independent inventor made\nhis invention before the filing date of the application for the prior patent, then\nhe may ask the Patent Office to declare an interference contest between himself\nand the other patentee. In this way, he may have the right to take inter partes\ntestimony for a determination as to who is really the first inventor. If the patent\ndiscloses, but does not claim the invention, however, and again, the independent\ninventor made the invention before the filing date of the application for the prior\npatent, the independent inventor may present ex parte evidence, by means of\naffidavit 15 , to demonstrate his earlier date of invention, and thus remove the\nother patent as a bar to the granting of his.\nSection 102 (f) deals with the necessity, previously discussed, for the appli\ncant to be the first inventor.\n3.3\nInterference\nSection 102 (g) provides for interference contests mentioned above to determine\npriority of invention where more than one person is claiming to be the original\ninventor. The statute describes the court-established rule that the first applicant\n15Patent Office Rule of Practice No. 131\n\nCreate or Perish\nto file is not necessarily, in law, the first inventor. The inventor is the first to\nreduce it to practice, but there is one exception to this rule. If, though the last\nto reduce it to practice, he was the first to conceive, and was diligently working\nat it when his rival entered the field and continued to do so until his reduction\nto practice, then he is the first inventor.\nPerhaps a few definitions of interference terminology may be helpful. Con\nception involves obtaining the complete mental picture of the invention, even\ntough one has not yet built it. If one is to rely upon a drawing or a notebook\ndisclosure or the like to prove conception, he must show that all of the elements\nof the claimed invention in controversy are present or implied therein.\nThe\nkeeping of full notes is thus greatly to be desired. Reduction to practice of the\ninvention means either building and successfully testing the invention (though\nthere are some exceptions to this necessity in the case of very simple devices)\nor filing a patent application for a theoretically operative model. Building and\nsuccessful testing is termed \"actual\" reduction to practice, filing a patent appli\ncation may constitute a \"constructive\" reduction to practice. Corroboration by\na qualified witness to the inventor's tests is important, since the courts, in order\nto avoid possible fraud, require such independent corroboration of the inventor's\ntestimony before accepting the latter's alleged dates.\nMany times, however, particularly if an individual with neither money nor\ntime with which to build and test an invention is satisfied with the theoretical\noperativeness of the invention, he may protect his rights by filing a patent\napplication, and thus obtain a constructive reduction to practice. The United\nStates Government currently takes the position, in contracts granted to develop\nor adapt inventions, that, no matter how much money one may have spent in\ndeveloping a conception or in reducing it to practice by filing patent applications\nand the like, if government money in substantial amounts is appropriated to\nbuild the invention for the first time under the contract, the government must\nbe granted a free license, with no strings attached 16 . The government may then,\nwith impunity, give to others than the inventors and developers the business of\nbuilding the invention commercially for it.\nAs a former member of a bar-association committee on government patent\npolicies, I can state that, unfortunately, many lawyers are apathetic in this\nmatter, which puts a particularly onerous burden on the small company. It is\nthe government, however, that suffers in the long run when individual inventors\nand their companies are discouraged from suggesting the creative flashes from\nwhich have sprung the seeds, not only of our weapons of defense and offense,\nbut also of our economic expansion and development.\n3.4\nThe Statutory Test of Invention\nThe court-made law relating to the requirement for the exercise of a \"flash of\ncreative genius,\" in order to support a patent, laid down by Mr. Justice Douglas\n16The Armed Services Procurement Regulations provide an exception in cases where the\nGovernment funds are relatively small and in other similar circumstances.\n\nThe Patent Law\n, was overthrown by Congress in the last sentence of Section 103 of the Patent\nAct of 1952:\nPatentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the\ninvention was made.\nIt has been superseded by another and entirely different test which assumes\nthat the requirements of Section 102 have been met. It reads:\nA patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically\ndisclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if\nthe differences between the subject matter sought to be patented\nand the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would\nhave been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person\nhaving ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\nPatentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the\ninvention was made.\nThe Supreme Court has, as yet, declined every opportunity offered it to\ninterpret this statutory provision of the ultimate test of whether an improvement\nis or is not sufficiently significant to warrant a patent grant. Since this question\nis the most pressing to every inventor, engineer, or other party concerned with\ninventions, a discussion of the history of this legislation and at least certain\nlower-court views with regard to it may be helpful.\nA \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter per\ntains\" has been the standard set up ever since at least 1850\n. Unfortunately,\nhowever, that standard has not always been met, but has varied with the differ\nent courts. When one court was desirous of sustaining a patent, one standard\nwas set up. When another court desired to invalidate a patent, the standard\nwas quite different. Matters reached such a state that, as before mentioned, the\nstandard became no longer a \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which\nsaid subject matter pertains\" but rather one inspired by \"the flash of creative\ngenius.\"\nThis \"flash-of-creative-genius\" standard has raised a storm of protest through\nout the country, since in practice it is almost impossible to attain. Such a yard\nstick would have invalidated many of our most important patents, including Eli\nWhitney's cotton gin, McCormick's reaper, the sewing machine, the air brake,\nthe telegraph, the telephone, and the electric lamp. Such invalidation, of course,\nwould have discouraged invention.\nWhether or not this result would have pleased a minority of justices of\nthe Supreme Court, it certainly did not please Congress.\nAnd the reaction\nof Congress, moreover, did not arise out of any solicitude for our large corpora\ntions:\n17Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., U.S. 84, 91 (1941).\n18Hotchkiss v.

Polaroid, Thiokol, Mallory, and many others, rep\nresent small and modest sized businesses which have launched new\nproducts against the competition of an existing industry . . . It should\nnot be assumed that every time an excuse is found to invalidate a\npatent, competition necessarily benefits\n.\nEven so, Congress had no desire to change the law, but rather to lower the\n\"flash-of-creative-genius\" standard to the level of the \"person having ordinary\nskill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\" Congress itself said so,\nin the Reviser's Note to Section 103:\nThis paragraph is added with the view that an explicit statement in\nthe statute may have some stabilizing effect. . .\nIt is of interest to observe, therefore, that the late Judge Learned Hand\nheld 20 that Section 103 does not actually constitute new legislation, but rather\nrestores the law to what it was \"twenty or thirty years ago\" before the courts\nbegan to adopt the standard of \"the flash of creative genius.\" Some courts have\nfollowed Judge Hand's decisions; others have not.\nCongress seemed convinced that only by such a restoring of the law would\nthe confidence of inventors be re-established and the progress of the useful arts\npromoted. Therefore, it is again studying the problem with the object of en\nacting further legislation.\nA subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary has been hearing testimony and collecting evidence for some years.\nSeveral reports by that subcommittee have expressed dissatisfaction with the\nlarge number of patents still being invalidated by the courts.\nIt may be well here to state that Section 103 had its origin in this very\ndissatisfaction. In the report of the National Patent Planning Commission, 1943,\nheaded by the late Charles F. Kettering, for example, appears the following:\nThe most serious weakness in the present patent system is the lack\nof a uniform test or standard for determining whether the particular\ncontribution of an inventor merits the award of the patent grant.\nThere is an ever-widening gulf between the decisions of the Patent\nOffice in granting patents and decisions of the courts who pass upon\ntheir validity. It would be highly desirable and a great step forward\nif patents could be issued with a greater assurance that their validity\nwould be upheld by the courts. No other feature of our law is more\ndestructive to the purpose of the patent system than this existing\nuncertainty as to the validity of a patent.\n19George E.

Bauch & Lomb Optical Co., 2 Cir., 224 F. 2d 530 (1955), certiorari denied 350\nU.S. 911, 955.\n\nThe Patent Law\n3.5\nObviousness of \"Subject Matter as a Whole\"\nThe restriction that an invention is not patentable if it is obvious as a whole, and\nnot merely in part, has been in force at least back to Supreme Court decisions\nin the late 1800's 21 .\nThe Century Dictionary gives the following definition of \"obvious\": \"easily\ndiscovered, seen, or understood; plain; manifest; evident; palpable.\" The way\nto determine whether an invention is obvious, accordingly, is by evidence.\nIn patent-infringement suit after patent-infringement suit, the plaintiff has\noffered evidence to show that he was the first to have offered a sought-after\nsolution to an existing problem and that, after disclosure of his solution, the\ndefendant appropriated it. The courts, in sanctioning this appropriation, have\nrarely disagreed with the plaintiff in his showing, but have thrown out his patent\nas involving merely an \"obvious\" step or device.\nBut such reasoning raises\nquestions.\nIf the solution of the problem disclosed by the inventor was obvious, why\ndid not the defendant adopt it earlier? Why did he wait until the invention was\nplaced upon the market by the plaintiff? If the prior-art developments constitute\nsatisfactory solutions of the given problem, as every defendant argues, why do\nnot the defendant use that prior art, instead of spending money in litigation in\norder to obtain the right to use the plaintiff's invention? If, on the other hand,\nthe prior art is not satisfactory, can it really be contended that the plaintiff has\naccomplished no more in his device than, \"as a whole,' was obvious in the prior\nart?\nBut in case after case the courts have insisted in holding the invention \"obvi\nous\" in the light of hindsight in prior-art knowledge, in the face of indisputable\nshowings that there was no \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which\nsaid subject matter pertains\" to whom the invention was as that time \"obvious.\"\nRecently, a court of appeals sustained a district court's holding\nthat \"I am\nnot so troubled\" about \"Monday-morning-quarterbacking\" as more \"sensitive\njudges\" would have been; \"it does not seem to me to require inventive genius\"\nto make the plaintiff's invention; \"I am unable to perceive invention.\"\nIn an earlier day, a district court judge similarly remarked\n. \"I am satisfied\nthat is amounts to nothing more than . . . I am unable to see how . . . \"; and the\ncourt of appeals reversed the decision, holding that these statements were not\nfindings of fact, but merely expressions of opinion, with \"no testimony in the\nrecord to support it.\"\nThe statute in Section 103, however, makes it plain that the question to be\ndecided by the court is not what may seem obvious after the event to lay courts\nor even technical experts, but, rather what\n21Bates v.

Supp. 321, 322, reversed 3 Cir. 67 F. 2d 190, 194\n(1933).\nThough the Supreme Court reversed at 292 U.S. 332 (293 U.S. 628), it was only\nbecause of a defect in appellate procedure.\n\nCreate or Perish\nwould have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a\nperson having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter\npertains.\nThis opinion has been reiterated recently by the Court of Customs and\nPatent Appeals\n:\nWhat amounts to patentable \"invention\" . . . is simply whether the\ndifference between what is claimed and the prior art would have been\nobvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention\nwas made.\nCertainly this does not mean whether the invention may seem obvious to\nthe court through hindsight.\nThe views of the late Judge Parker 25 , of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit, may be of interest:\nThe state of the prior art, the problem to which the invention was\naddressed, its success in solving the problem, its acceptance by the\nart, and its success commercially should be accorded more weight\nthan what the judge, who is unfamiliar with the art or with the\nproblems of industry generally, may chance to think, in the light of\nthe problem's solution, as to what one skilled in the art should have\nknown or should have been able to do.\nHe went on:\nAnd especially should the judge be on guard against permitting an\nticipation to be found in the bone yard of abandoned experiments\nand mere paper patents. In such case the searching and conclusive\ninquiry is: \"If what has caused such a great change in the art and\nsuch an improvement in the industry was old and ready at hand,\nwhy did not it occur to someone else to use it?\"\nAs one court of appeals\nremarked:\nIt is usually, if not indeed always, easy to discover a genesis some\nwhere for any patentee's contribution. But if patents were to be held\ninvalid on such reasoning, few would survive.\nAn invention, moreover, is always \"simple\" and \"obvious\" after it has been\ndisclosed. The Supreme Court of an earlier era said\n:\n24Application of Ruff and Dukeshire, CCPA, 256 F. 2d 590, 598 (1958).\n25\"Recurrence of Fundamentals,\" in American Bar Association Journal, Vol. 30, p. 623\n(1944).\n26S.D.

Now that it has succeeded, it may seem\nvery plain to any one that he could have done it as well. This is\noften the case with inventions of the greatest merit. It may be laid\ndown as a general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that\nif a new combination and arrangement of known elements produce\na new and beneficial result, never attained before, it is evidence of\ninvention.\nThe invention of the patent in suit in the Barbed Wire Patent case 28 lay in\nwrapping the barb several times around the carrier wire, so that a bearing was\nprovided for the barb, which was thus held permanently at right angles to the\ncarrier wire. The prior art disclosed the same barb, but without the bearing,\nso that it wobbled about the carrier wire instead of being held rigidly at right\nangles.\nThe Supreme Court remarked that \"it may be strange\" that this simple\ndevice was not \"obvious.\" Yet, \"simple\" and \"obvious\" as this improvement\nappeared in retrospect, it laid a foundation for accomplishing something that\nthe prior art could not do. By the new barbed-wired invention, cattle could be\nkept within their wired enclosures.\nA short time later 29 , in sustaining a patent, the Supreme Court spoke of\nan invention that \"appears to the ordinary mind so simple as to excite wonder\nthat it was not thought of before.\" And, still later\n:\nIts simplicity should not blind us as to its character. Many things,\nand the patent laws abounds in illustrations, seem obvious after they\nhave been done. . . . Knowledge after the event is always easy, and\nproblems once solved present no difficulties.\nThe invention involved in the Eibel Process case\n, in retrospect, was again\n\"simple\" and \"obvious.\" It merely raised slightly the rear end of the belt of the\nFourdrinier papermaking machine, in order the the liquid pulp traveling thereon\ncould move a little faster, by gravity. Small as the advance was, however, it was\npromptly adopted by the industry.\nAgain, the invention in the Ray-O-Vac case of the early 1940's 32 was \"a\nvery narrow one in a crowded art.\" It consisted of enclosing a flashlight battery\nin a steel casing to render it leakproof. But this idea had never occurred (and\nhence manifestly was not obvious) to those persons (other than the inventor)\n\"having ordinary skill in the art\" who had long been troubled with the battery\nleakage.\n28143 U.S. 275, 283 (1892).\n29Potts v.

Ray-O-Vac C., 321 U.S. 275, 279 (1944).\n\nCreate or Perish\nAnd so it would seem that honest adherence to the spirit and scope of the\ntests of Section 103 should go a long way toward stabilizing the ultimate test of\npatentable invention.\n3.6\nStatutory Presumption of Validity of a Patent\nNumerous decisions indicate that, certainly as codified by Section 282 of the\nPatent Act of 1952,\na patent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing inva\nlidity of a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.\nThe Supreme Court had previously held 33 that \"the burden of proof to make\ngood this defense\" is \"upon the party setting it up,\" and \"every reasonable doubt\nshould be resolved against him.\"\nBut the courts of the mid-twentieth century have paid little attention to this\npresumption. As Judge Galston has said\n,\nin the last two decades, though courts had said prior thereto that\npatents were entitled to a presumption of validity, during the latter\nyears only lip service has been given to that doctrine. Now it becomes\nclear that since there is a statutory presumption, it may not be\nignored.\nThis policy followed the dissent in the early 1940's of Mr. Justice Black\n:\nIn the absence of a statutory prescription to the contrary, I see no\nreason for extending the presumption of validity arising from the\nmere issuance of a patent. . . .\nSection 282 of the Patent Act of 1952 now provides that \"statutory prescrip\ntion.\" The presumption is greatly increased, moreover, when the art cited by\na defendant in an infringement suit is substantially the same as the art before\nthe examiner in the Patent Office.\nIf it were not for prejudices in the field of patents, the trend of decisions in\nthe administrative law field would seem to indicate that there should be, though\nthere is not, a steadily growing tendency to follow the proposal of an earlier\ncourt of appeals 36 in giving special weight to the use of skilled examiners in\nthe Patent Office in determining patentability. Surely, by Section 282, Congress\nintended that patents should not be held invalid merely by \"Monday-morning\nquarterbacking.\"\n33Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories Inc., 293 U.S. 1, 7 - 8 (1934).\n3413 F.R.D. 463, 469.\n35Williams Mfg. Co. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 316 U.S. 364, 392 (1942).\n36United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. Muther, 1 Cir., 288, 287 (1923).\n\nThe Patent Law\n3.7\nCommentary-The Case for Sympathetic Legal Recognition of Inventions\nThere is certainly a feeling in some judicial quarters that patents should not be\ngranted for \"gadgets\" or trivial devices, as contrasted with such inventions as\nthe atomic bomb; and perhaps this may seriously affect the construction put on\nthe Patent Act of 1952.\nThis was certainly the public policy advocated by Mr. Justice Douglas in\nhis opinion in the A&P case\n:\nThe patent involved in the present case belongs to this list of incred\nible patents which the Patent Office has spawned.\nIf I understand Mr. Justice Douglas correctly, he regards a patent for an ev\neryday household item as an \"incredible patent.\" Certainly he so classified one\nfor a collar.\nApparently Mr.\nJustice Douglas views a collar as among \"the\nsimplest of devices,\" one of a \"host of gadgets,\" for the improvement of which\nmen should not be encouraged to devote their inventive faculties. This view, it\nshould be observed, was merely Mr. Justice Douglas's opinion, concurred in, at\nthat time, by Mr. Justice Black and by no other justice.\nThe records show, however, that at another time a particular invention in\na collar was important enough to revolutionize a whole industry, and a patent\nfor it was sustained by one of our greatest judges, Learned Hand\n. Probably\nJustices Douglas and Black themselves have benefited by that very invention,\nfor it is doubtful whether they still wear the prior-art collars. Furthermore,\nthe Supreme Court itself has sustained a patent for a bare collar button 39 , and\nmany patents for articles of wearing apparel and other \"gadgets\" of considerable\nvalue to the public have heretofore been sustained.\nAs later will be made more evident, the part played by individual inven\ntors and small companies in the development of such inventions is still great.\nAnd still pertinent is the unheeded call in late depression years of the then\ncommissioner of patents, the Honorable Conway P. Coe:\nWhat a patent issues to an inventor we purport to give him the\nright, the exclusive right, for a term of 17 years to prevent others\nfrom making, using, or selling the invention covered by it. But we\nsay that with our tongue in our cheek, for we know better than he\nthat by our present method of adjudicating patent rights he will\nfind it exceedingly difficult to prevent the wrongful appropriation\nof his property and may be compelled to stand helpless while he is\ndespoiled. . . .\nMy conviction is that the poor inventor, and through him the pub\nlic, suffers injustice precisely for the reason and to the extent that\nthe monopoly, the exclusive right, purportedly bestowed on him is\n37Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 158\n(1950).\n38Van Heusen Products, Inc. v. Earl and Wilson, 300 F. 922, 925 (1924).\n39Krementz v. The S. Cottle Co., 148 U.S. 556 (1893).\n\nCreate or Perish\nnot now fully safeguarded. What we need is not to decrease but\nto enhance the monopoly called a patent.\nGenuine protection in\nthat form would be the last surviving bulwark standing between the\ninventor and the onslaught of mighty corporations.\nA patent should function as a leveler whereby an individual or a\ncompany of small means may be enabled to hold his or its rights of\nproperty against the prssure of the strongest adversary. It should\nhave a protective character like that of a high-power rifle in the\nhands of a puny man beset by a wildly charging bull elephant. Un\nfortunately, that patent affords no safeguards. . . .\nThe patent system of the United States, more than any other in the\nworld, offers hope, encouragement, opportunity and recompense to\nan individual or a company of small resources. It is as democratic\nas the Constitution which begot it.\nCongress has recognized this problem at least partially and has tried to\nsolve it. The Patent Act of 1952, it is to be hoped, has restored the standard\nof invention at least to what it was originally and continued to be up to very\nrecent years. If questions of public policy are involved, therefore, Congress has\nmade plain that its purpose in enacting the new Patent Act was to remove the\ndiscouragement of inventors induced by prior decisions of the courts.\nParticularly in view of the extremely large number of important and break\nthrough inventions that still flow from independent inventors and small com\npanies 40 , we cannot sit back and merely wait for the fruits of government-\nsponsored and large-corporation research. Never before in modern history has\nAmerica been threatened so seriously from abroad - both economically and\nmilitarily - and hence never before has it needed so desperately to encourage\ninvention from all quarters.\nWith the same end in view of encouraging invention, Congress, in 1954, in\nSection 1235 of the Internal Review Code, allowed capital-gains tax treatment to\nprofessional inventors and their backers, under certain circumstances, while dis\ncriminating against authors. Recent interview studies of independent inventors,\nconducted under the auspices of The Academy of Applied Science at Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, revealed fully the error of the Treasury Department's proposed\nrepeal of this Section 1235 together with the removal of sales of patents by an\ninventor (even an amateur inventor) from possible capital gains treatment\n.\nNow these independent inventors represented a wide range of experience in\ninnovation engaged in from six to more than forty years. Their more impor\ntant inventions included: methods of calibrating D.C. instruments; magnetic\namplified control systems; mechanical-electrical transducers; systems to con\nvert capacitance changes to output voltages; shades that keep out heat but let\nin sunlight; inventions in image intensification; medical instruments; methods\n40Donald A.

(The inventions which I have italicized have revolution\nized industries.)\nMost of these inventors sell or exclusively license their inventions, thereby\nplacing themselves under the capital-gains category of Section 1235; or they own\ntheir own companies, which in most cases have been built around one or more\nof their own inventions, with the capital-gains provision used to build up the\ncompany. Their technically successful inventions ranged from about 20 to 80\nper cent, with a mean about one in three. Of these, only about one in five has\nbeen a substantial income-producer to the inventor; the average yearly return\nfrom licensing or selling inventions being from $10,000 to $50,000.\nThe average time lag between the making of an invention and the receipt\nof returns therefrom was five years; and more than half of all the commercially\nsuccessful inventions had to be pioneered on the market by the inventor himself\nbefore others could be persuaded to adopt them. Only one of these inventors\nreceived any financial backing from a government contract in the making of his\ninventions.\nThe inventors interviewed, moreover, had not only provided the country with\nmany new products and processes, but had, in the process, created thousands\nof new jobs, and tens of millions of dollars of new sales. Dare we risk discour\naging this well of current invention by making an already highly dangerous and\nspeculative profession untenable to pursue\n. Unsympathetic decisions by the\ncourts or administrative agencies can only negate the policy of Congress which\nwould encourage inventors to continue to invent and businessmen to take risks\non the development of invention.\n42Benjamin F.

This par\nticular invention was selected because its technology is familiar to\nall types of reader and because almost everything that could happen\ndid happen to Bell; except that he was saved by a single vote in the\nSupreme Court from the anonymity experienced by many current\ninventors.\nBy turning to a detailed study of the so-called Bell Telephone Cases, in\nvolving an invention understandable and intimately known by everyone\n, we\ncan both tie together many of the various principles of patent law heretofore\ndiscussed, and set up a real laboratory experiment by which to observe the\nrather typical actions and reactions of American industry and business to inde\npendent innovation. In this way we can learn something about the intricacies\nand mysteries of patent litigation in the courts.\n4.1\nThe Circumstances Underlying Bell's Invention\nA little, first, about Alexander Graham Bell. He was not a native-born American\n2 . This has some significance for what happened in this case. At the time here\ninvolved, only American citizens could file an intention, called a \"caveat,\" and\nfile later a patent application for an invention. If the caveat was seasonably\nfollowed by a patent application, the inventor could thereby obtain the benefit\nof the early date of the caveat filing. Had Bell been an American citizen with\n1Frederick V. Hunt, Electroacoustics, Harvard Monographs in Applied Science, No.\n5,\nHarvard University Press and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1954, pp. 23-25.\n2The large number of basic inventions heretofore made by foreign-born Americans should\ngive us cause for concern in light of present-day security restrictions and their effect upon the\nencouragement of invention\n\nCreate or Perish\nthe right to file a caveat, certain alleged prior inventions by others could not\nhave been asserted against his claim of prior inventorship. Bell had to wait until\nhe had completed his inventive processes, at least theoretically, before he could\nfile his application in the Patent Office.\nBell was born on March 3, 1847, in Edinburgh, the son of a teacher of\nelocution. At a very early age, he naturally became interested in the problems of\nspeech and lip reading and ultimately assisted his father, who was the professor\nof elocution at the University of London. When the latter was offered a position\nin this country, he sent his son, in his stead, to join the staff of the Boston School\nfor the Deaf.\nAt this time, the Western Union Company, having bought up the small\nindividual operating telegraph systems in the country, was in control of the\ncountry's first national communications chain. One of the problems that it was\nfacing was that of the simultaneous transmission of a plurality of Morse-code\nmessages over the same wires. Its engineers were heavily engaged in trying to\nsolve this problem. Bell heard about it, became interested, and decided to set\nout to solve it. Fortunately, in his impecunious state, he met a Boston attorney,\nGardner Greene Hubbard, who, becoming intrigued with the potential financial\nreturn from an invention that could solve this problem, agreed to supply funds\nwith which Bell could carry on his researches.\nThe concept that Bell evolved related to the simultaneous transmission of\na plurality of different tones, each carrying a different telegraph message. At\nthe receiving end, a number of tuned reeds were provided, each tuned to one of\nthe different tones. Bell reasoned that only the reed tuned to a particular tone\nwould reproduce that tone, and so each message would be selectively received\nby its corresponding reed.\nIt is important for our purposed to remember that this multiple-telegraphy\nproblem, called the\"harmonic telegraph,\" was the concept that Bell set out to\nexplore. This is important because it illustrates what often happens when an\ninventor or applied scientist sets out to solve a problem. Frequently, the inves\ntigator makes an accidental auxiliary discovery or observes some phenomenon\nhe cannot explain. When given the freedom to drop the planned research goal\nfor the moment and to explore this diversion, inventors have made far more im\nportant inventions than the original research project contemplated, devices that\nsolved different and ofter more important problems. There is the serious ques\ntion whether today, under government sponsorship of research, and even under\nthe research policies of many industrial companies, the investigator would have\nthat freedom to stop momentarily, to lay aside the original goal, and to explore\nthe striking new channel.\nBell was joined in his experiments by Thomas A. Watson, and the two worked\ntogether in a garret, as the popular story has it, on the harmonic telegraph. One\nday Watson misadjusted a reed, so that instead of vibrating back and forth, to\nmake and break an electrical circuit and thereby to reproduce the telegraphic\ndot-and-dash message, the reed became stuck fast in a closed-circuit position.\nBell, being in the room at the time, heard something he had never heard before,\na kind of muffled tone of entirely different quality and clarity from the ringing\n\nPatents in Action\ntones of make-and-break reeds. He was puzzled as to how, in a completely closed\ncircuit, the tone could be reproduced. This was perhaps the first inkling that\ncommunication results could be obtained other than by making and breaking\nelectrical circuits. Here was a tone that was coming through when the circuit\nremained closed, the stuck reed apparently responding to current variations in\nthe winding behind it.\nMind you, Bell was still working on this harmonic\ntelegraph problem.\nAt this point, however, realizing the significance of this discovery, Bell went\nto Mr. Hubbard and requested permission to stop work on the harmonic tele\ngraph, and to start investigating the problems inherent in speech reproduction.\nMr. Hubbard, interested in the big bounty awaiting the first person to solve\nWestern Union's problem of multiple telegraphy, was unable to see any future\nin a speech machine, and so repeatedly instructed Bell to continue on the har\nmonic telegraph and to forget esoteric speech problems.\nThe record shows,\nhowever, that Bell slanted his work towards a speech machine, under the guise\nof a modified version of the harmonic telegraph.\nOn February 14, 1876, Bell filed a patent application. This application pur\nported to cover the harmonic telegraph for simultaneously producing multiple-\ntone messages. The application clearly explained, however, that it covered also\na machine that would reproduce vocal sounds. Bell put both inventions in one\ncase. On March 7, less than one month later, the Patent Office issued the first\nBell patent on that application. The patent number was 174,465. Note that it\ntook Bell less than a month to get his patent. Contrast that with the several\nyears that may be involved in issuing a patent today, particularly in the light of\nthe events to be subsequently related, where others soon commenced to violate\nBell's rights. At least Bell, unlike a present-day inventor, promptly obtained a\npatent that enabled him to try to enforce his rights, instead of having to sit back\nand wait in frustration. Here is the fortuitous circumstance that Bell obtained\nhis patent promptly.\n4.2\nBell's Basic Patent\nFigure 2 reproduces part of the basic Bell patent relating to the original tele\nphone, with Fig. 7 thereof illustrating a mouthpiece at A, into which the voice\nsounds were to be directed. There was a metal diaphragm a that would vibrate\nin accordance with those voice sounds. Behind the diaphragm a was an electro\nmagnetic winding b that was connected in the following electrical circuit: from\nground E, through a battery, to and through the winding b, along the line e,\nto a similar receiving winding f, and then back to ground again, at g. Thus\nthere is provided a closed circuit for the flow of electric current. In this patent,\nBell explained that as the diaphragm a moved closer to and farther away from\nthe winding b, in response to voice vibrations, the effect of its varying position,\nrelative to the winding b, would be able to induce, in this winding b, varia\ntions in the current flowing therein. By this technique, the exact undulations of\nsound produced by the voice can be converted into corresponding electric cur\nrent undulations or variations in the above-mentioned circuity. The receiving or\n\nCreate or Perish\nreproducing diaphragm i would thus be attracted to and repelled from the re\nceiving winding f, causing air in front of the diaphragm i to be correspondingly\nset into vibration, thereby to reproduce the original voice sound.\nFig. 4.1: Part of Bell's original telephone patent. (This image is public domain\nand is not protected by copyright.)\nNow this is the theory that Bell proposed in his patent. The evidence ad\nduced in subsequent litigation involving his patent demonstrated that Bell had\nnever made this device work for voice sounds until after he had received his\npatent. It is important to note, however, that he did have a valid theory of\noperation. More of this later.\nHis attorney presented two kinds of claims in the patent. It is to be recalled\nthat one of the patentable classes of invention is a new piece of apparatus,\nwhich may be a new combination of old elements, operating in a new cooperative\nmanner to achieve a new result. It will be recalled, also, that the law permits the\npatenting of a new process or art or method, namely a new series of steps capable\nof performance with any of a host of different types of apparatus. The concept\nthat Bell had evolved was a method wherein a continuous electric current was\nto be maintained, but whose value was to be changed in accordance with voice-\nsound undulations, and without interrupting the complete-circuit flow of the\ncurrent. That, Bell asserted, was his new method. His attorney worded the\nclaims in both method and apparatus form, and it is wise that he did so. It will\nbe demonstrated shortly that, had he worded the claims in specific apparatus\nform alone, some of Bell's early competitors might have been free of the charge\nof infringement.\nBut, having worded a broad claim to embrace the method\nalso, the attorney provided the court with grounds for construing the infringing\ndevices, which were pieces of apparatus different from Bell's, as falling within\nthe scope of Bell's invention. To quote claim 5:\n\nPatents in Action\nThe method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds\ntelegraphically, as herein described, by causing electrical undula\ntions, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the\nsaid vocal or other sounds, substantially as set forth.\nOf course, the Patent Office would not let a claim like that be written today\nbecause of present-day requirements for the recitations of structure in more\nprecise form, nor would the courts be likely to sustain such a general wording.\nThe Patent Office (and the courts) have become very ritualistic and formal.\nThe important thing for our story, however, is that Bell's attorney obtained a\npatent both for the steps of the method and for a piece of apparatus.\nWatson, working under Bell's direction, evolved the principle of substituting\nfor this electromagnetic apparatus a permanent magnet. This simplified the\ncommercial construction, a second patent, No. 186,787, issued the following\nyear, on January 30, 1877, principally for the improvement of a fixed magnet.\nBell, still struggling under the adverse conditions usually besetting the in\ndividual inventor and entrepreneur, did the natural thing. He went to West\nern Union, the party most interested in communications, and offered his basic\npatent for the telephone for $100,000. Western Union, in turn, consulted with\nthe ablest scientific people and engineers and the best business minds of that\nday and came to the conclusion that there was no commercial future for an\ninstrument that would reproduce voice sounds. Hence, it turned down Bell's\noffer 3 .\nIt may be interesting to depart briefly from the main theme to point out that\nthe supposedly ablest industrial, scientific, and government people of our own\nday make similar unimaginative decisions over and over again. Where inventors\nformerly persisted and proceeded somehow on their own, as did Bell, in the true\nAmerican tradition, and sometimes made a success of their inventions to the\nbenefit of the country, the recent policies of our government, our industry, and\nour courts, as will be shown later, have tended to kill or at least hamper much\nof the incentive.\n4.3\nThe Founding of Bell's Company - and the Pirates\nIn Bell's day, however, the American pioneering spirit still existed, and Bell,\nunthwarted, determined to promote his invention himself. He and his associates\nraised capital in Boston and formed the American Bell Telephone Company.\nWithin a year or two, they were actually supplying instruments to the public.\nHaving now embarked upon a business, as distinguished from a research venture,\nBell needed to and did obtain practical improvement patents for commercially\nacceptable structures. And the demand for these crude telephone instruments\nwas so great that the new company could not keep up with its orders.\nTwo short years later, in 1879 (once Bell had shown the way) the Western\nUnion reversed its decision that there was no commercial future in the speaking\n3The technical and financial advisers to industrialist Chauncey Depew were instrumental\nin the later turn-down of an offer of a one-third interest in Bell's enterprise for the sum of\n$10,000.\n\nCreate or Perish\ntelegraph toy, and it formed the American Speaking and Telephone Company.\nIn typical free-enterprise fashion, stimulated by the fact that Bell had obtained\na patent, Western Union employed two renowned inventors to work around what\nBell had done and to avoid his patent\n. The whole world is familiar with the\nnames of Thomas Alva Edison and Elisha Gray, the men selected by Western\nUnion.\nThomas Edison, upon his employment by Western Union, went to work to\ndevise what we would today call a transducer for using the voice vibrations\nto affect the magnitude of the electric current far more effectively than Bell's\ndid, and came up with the carbon-button microphone, which is still in use.\nWestern Union, accordingly, treated Bell's patent as limited to armatures and\ndiaphragms and put on the market its own telephone, using Edison's invention.\nThis carbon-button microphone performed infinitely better than did Bell's crude\nelectromagnetic device, so that the quality of the Western Union instrument was\nfar above that of the American Bell Telephone Company's. One can begin to\nsee the problem facing the latter company when customers could obtain a much\nimproved instrument from its competitor.\nTo solve this, Bell's company decided to employ inventors other than Bell,\nin an effort to produce as good an instrument as Edison's carbon-button mi\ncrophone. They therefore hired Emil Berliner, who had effected a filing in the\nPatent Office two weeks earlier than Edison's patent application for the carbon\nbutton microphone. (And this was, of course, one of the reasons why he was\nselected.) While Berliner did not invent a carbon-button microphone, he did\ndevise a type of metal-contact microphone that could be termed a variable\nresistance microphone. This was an apparatus operating upon a different physi\ncal principal (variable resistance) from that of Bell's inductive armature-diaphragm\napparatus, and, if new, was entitled to independent patent protection. The sig\nnificance of this is that, since variable resistance is also the principle underlying\nthe operating of the Edison carbon-button microphone, if Berliner could obtain\nbroad patent claims to a variable-resistance microphone, the Bell Company\nwould have another tool with which to ward off Western Union's challenge.\nThe Patent Office set up an interference proceeding between Berliner and\nEdison to determine which was entitled to the broad variable-resistance-microphone\nclaims. It is interesting to observe that years later, when Berliner's patent fi\nnally issued, it had the effect of extending the basic \"monopoly,\" as that term\nis popularly used, of the American Bell Telephone Company. The patent was\nattacked unsuccessfully upon the ground of extension of monopoly by the At\ntorney General 5 , though later it was invalidated by the Circuit Court for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts as anticipated by Edison's work .\nThe American Bell Telephone Company held the view that Bell's basic\npatent was very broad and was not restricted to any particular form of appara\n4History shows over and over again that, far from stifling progress, the granting of im\nportant patents causes industry to look for alternative approaches in an effort to avoid the\npatent, thereby further promoting the progress of the useful arts.\n5United States v. American Bell Telephone Co. & Emil Berliner, 167 U.S. 244 (1897).\n6109 F. 976 (1901).\n\nPatents in Action\ntus. Under such interpretation, of course, a telephone using Edison's improved\ntransducer, the carbon-button microphone, would infringe the broad telephone\nclaims of Bell's patent. Bell could not, therefore, stand by and sanction the\nWestern Union infringement upon his patent.\nClaim 5 of the basic patent,\nquoted earlier, does not specify whether the electrical undulations similar in\nform to the vibrations of the air are caused by use of a variable resistance or by\nuse of a magnetic armature circuit, but very broadly covers that they are made\nto do so. Thus, on the theory that this broad claim covered any way found to\ndo this equivalent to Bell's disclosed magnetic armature-diaphragm apparatus,\nAmerican Bell Telephone Company sued Western Union.\nI have said nothing yet about Elisha Gray, who, like Edison, had been em\nployed as an inventor by Western Union. One of the reasons for his employment\nwas that on the very same day, February 14, 1876, that Alexander Graham Bell\nhad filed his patent application for the basic patent, Elisha Gray, an American\ncitizen, had filed in the Patent Office a caveat for a telephone. He had appar\nently independently conceived the idea of having a closed circuit and of varying\nthe value of the current therein, in accordance with voice sounds. (See Figure\n3.) As the voice vibrations moved a diaphragm a (Fig. 1) back and forth, a\nwire A was simultaneously inserted to varying depths into a conducting water\nsolution B. Hence, in theory, the resistance between the wire A in the water and\nwater solution B varied because there was more or less contact area between the\nwire and the water. This, then, was a variable-resistance device, moving back\nand forth in the same way as the air undulations, in an uninterrupted electrical\ncircuit. But Gray did not follow up this caveat with a patent application, and\nhis rights were accordingly lost. He was still useful to Western Union, however,\nbecause, whether or not he obtained a patent, Bell's patent could be invalidated\nif Gray had actually made the invention before Bell. There was also a charge of\nfraud raised in the Telephone Cases to the effect that word of Gray's caveat was\npassed to Bell's attorney, and that the latter supposedly arranged for Bell's ap\nplication to be changed in the Patent Office to include Gray's variable-resistance\nprinciple, but the Supreme Court found no evidence at all of such fraud.\nA great deal of testimony was taken in the suit between Bell Telephone and\nWestern Union, and the attorneys for the latter advised their client that they\nthought Bell was going to win the case. Since they had an interference in the\nPatent Office, Edison v. Berliner, on the broad variable-resistance issue, and\nsince they had this court litigation on the basic Bell patent, Western Union\ndecided to see if a compromise could be reached.\nIt should be added that,\nalthough Western Union had infringed Bell's claim 5, the Bell Company, on\nthe other hand, could not operate commercially without using Edison's carbon-\nbutton microphone invention.\nIn other words, the Western Union attorneys\nwere sure they would lose their suit, but Bell was also anxious to settle it to\nobtain the rights under Edison's invention.\nAccordingly, a settlement was reached on the basis that, for a period of\nseventeen years, the American Bell Telephone Company would pay one-fifth of\nall its proceeds to Western Union, Western Union would give the rest of its\nstock of telephone equipment to the America Bell Telephone Company, and\n\nCreate or Perish\nFig. 4.2: A part of Elisha Gray's caveat. (This image is public domain and is\nnot protected by copyright.)\nfrom that time on Western Union would not engage in the telephone business\nfor the seventeen-year period. This, of course, was a business decision, forced\nperhaps by the patent difficulties. It certainly stands out, however, as one of\nthe most fateful management decisions imaginable. Looked at with hindsight,\nit was responsible for the subsequent decline of Western Union.\n4.4\nEnters the Supreme Court\nAfter the court litigation with Western Union was settled, other equally ambi\ntious entrepreneurs, in the normal American tradition, sprang up all over the\ncountry, each setting up a small telephone company and proceeding along its own\nmerry way in defiance of Bell's patent. Suits were thereupon brought against\none Dolbear, a professor at Tufts College, against the Molecular Telephone\nCompany in the southern district of New York, against the Clay Commercial\nTelephone Company, in the eastern district of Pennsylvania, and against the\nPeople's Telephone Company and the Overland Telephone Company, both in\nthe southern district of New York. In each suit, Bell's patent was sustained.\nFinally, all these cases came up before the United States Supreme Court, which\ndecided to consolidate them and to hear all the appeals at one time. These Tele\nphone Cases are reported in a complete volume of the Supreme Court decisions,\nreferred to as 126 U.S.\nThe defendants contested the validity of Bell's patent. They also denied\ninfringement upon the basis that the latter's patent must be limited to what is\nshown in the patent, and none of the supposedly infringing telephones used the\nmagnetic armature-diaphragm apparatus of the patent. I shall now examine\nhow the Supreme Court treated these various defenses, and what its decisions\nwere.\nFirst of all, the reader may gain a picture of how close to the prior art\nimportant inventions often are, by learning that these defendants cited some\nfifteen different men who, they maintained, made this invention before Bell.\n\nPatents in Action\nThey included a Philip Reis of Germany, the before-mentioned Elisha Gray\nand Thomas Edison, Professor Dolbear, and one Daniel Drawbaugh. The de\nfendants also asserted that there were eight United States patents, six British\npatents, and a French one, all issued before Bell's basic patent and disclos\ning the same invention. The defendants alleged, further, that there were six\nUnited States patents, three British patents, and a Canadian one for the same\ninvention as Bell's second improvement patent, before mentioned. They cited\nsome sixty-three publications before Bell's, including French, British, German,\nUnited States, Italian, and Irish publications, all supposedly anticipating Bell's\nconcept. And in connection with the latter's second patent, they listed fifty-one\npublications to show that others had thought of the invention before Bell.\nNow these were technical people, applied scientists, business people, and\nattorneys, who were advancing rational arguments; they were trying to persuade\na court that Bell's contribution was anticipated. I proceed, therefore, to the\ndetails of these defenses and how the court handled them.\nThe first defense here involved is that Bell was attempting to patent a natural\nforce, a scientific fact. He was purporting, in claim 5, to monopolize the scientific\nfact that, if one varies the electric current in the same way that the sound\nproduced by the voice varies, speech will be reproduced. This, the defendants\nmaintained, is a fact of nature to which our patent laws do not extend. And they\ncited a Supreme Court decision to support that principle, O'Reilly v. Morse\n(15 How. 62). In that case, Samuel F. B. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph,\ntried to claim all uses of electricity for transmitting intelligence from one point\nto another. The Supreme Court there held that an attempt to patent all such\npossible uses of electricity is too broad and is really an attempt to patent a force\nof nature. The court struck down Morse's broadest claim, claim 8.\nSo the defendants in Bell's suits, by analogy, argued that Bell's claim 5 gave\nhim the monopoly of all possible ways of making these electrical currents cor\nrespond to the voice undulations, and, as such, represented merely a discovery\nof nature that was not one of those things that, under our patent laws, was\nsusceptible to patent protection. As previously explained, a scientific discovery,\nper se, is not patentable under our laws.\nWhat did the court answer? To quote from page 534:\nIn O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, it was decided that a claim in\nbroad terms (p. 86) for the use of the motive power of the electric\nor galvanic current called 'electromagnetism,' however developed,\nfor making or printing intelligible characters, letters or signs . . . was\nvoid, because (p. 20) it was a claim for a patent for an effect pro\nduced by the use of electromagnetism, distinct from the process or\nmachinery necessary to produce it.\nThe court continued that in Bell's case, on the other hand,\nthe claim is not for the use of a current of electricity in its natural\nstate as it comes from the battery, but for putting a continuous\n\nCreate or Perish\ncurrent in a closed circuit into a certain specified condition suited\nto the transmission of vocal and other sounds, and using it in that\ncondition for that purpose.\nThe court was not unmindful of the fact that\nit may be that electricity cannot be used at all for the transmission\nof speech except in the way Bell has discovered, and that, therefore,\npractically, his patent gives him exclusive use for that purpose, but\nthat does not make his claim one for the use of electricity distinct\nfrom the particular process with which it is connected in his patent.\nIt will, it is true, show more clearly the great importance of his\ndiscovery, but it will not invalidate his patent.\nHence, concluded the Supreme Court, this is not a case where Bell is taking\nraw nature, the force of a battery, the force of a current, and trying to claim\nall uses of it for speech reproduction.\nThis is a case, rather, where Bell is\nmolding the current into something that was not there originally, and varying\nthat current in accordance with the variation of air pressure produced by voice\nsounds. This is a method or process. It is not pure scientific discovery. It is,\nrather, the application of scientific discovery to a particular problem. It is the\nkind of invention that our patent laws cover.\nThe next defense advanced was that Bell did not really make his invention\nwork until after his patent issued. It will be recalled that Bell had witnessed\nthe experiment of the stuck reed, but that was not voice. He had not actually\ntransmitted voice at that time, and, in fact, he did not suceed in doing so until\nafter his basic patent issued. So, said the defendants, Bell did not really make\nthe invention until after he had obtained the patent.\nHow did the court answer that? To quote from page 535:\nIt is quite true that when Bell applied for his patent he had never\nactually transmitted telegraphically spoken words so that they could\nbe distinctly heard and understood at the receiving end, but,\nthe court continued - and this is very important -\nin his specification he did describe accurately and with admirable\nclearness his process, that is to say, the exact electrical condition that\nmust be created to accomplish his purpose, and he also described,\nwith sufficient precision to enable one of ordinary skill in such mat\nters to make it, a form of apparatus which, if used in the way pointed\nout, would produce the required effect, receive the words, and carry\nthem to and deliver them at the appointed place.\nThe court concluded on that topic (p. 536)\nThe law does not require that a discoverer or inventor, in order to\nget a patent for a process, must have succeeded in bringing his art\n\nPatents in Action\nto the highest degree of perfection. It is enough if he describes his\nmethod with sufficient clearness and precision to enable those skilled\nin the matter to understand what the process is, and if he points\nout some practical way of putting it into operation. This Bell did.\nHence arises the rule of law, previously treated, that the filing of a theoreti\ncally operative patent application constitutes, in contemplation of the law, a\nconstructive reduction to practice of that invention. An inventor does not need\nto wait until he can accumulate the several million dollars necessary to build\na computer and test it. If he has some new principles that are worthy of pro\ntection and he can theoretically demonstrate their operability, he can obtain a\npatent.\nThe next defense advanced was that there was no infringement because,\nas earlier pointed out, claim 5 of that patent called for the apparatus \"sub\nstantially as set forth.\" Bell set forth an electromagnetic armature-diaphragm\nmicrophone. The defendants maintained that they were not using those electro\nmagnets. Professor Dolbear 7 , for example, employed a microphone that appears\nto resemble what we would now describe as an electrostatic microphone, acting\nas a variable impedance in the circuit. This defendant's position was that his\napparatus, which was restricted to inducing current variations by moving the\ndiaphragm nearer to and farther from the electromagnetic winding.\nThe court dealt with this defense of noninfringement as follows (p. 538):\nThe patent is both for the magneto and variable resistance methods\nand for the particular magneto apparatus which is described, or is\nequivalent.\nWhat the court is saying here is that, insofar as the method is concerned, it\nmay be practiced whether one uses a magneto, meaning the Bell electromagnetic\narmature-diaphragm structure, or a variable-resistance device. The use of either\ndevice still involves the method of causing the electric current to vary with the\nvoice-sound undulations. As for the apparatus, however, the court agreed that\nthe apparatus described in the patent claim was only the magnetic armature\ndiaphragm apparatus that Bell disclosed, or its equivalent. While it is not clear,\nthe court later appeared to imply that the variable-resistance device was also\nan equivalent of the \"magneto.\" At any rate, it can be seen how important was\nthe decision by Bell's attorney to insert the magic word \"method,\" as well as\napparatus, in the claim.\nTo continue with the court's analysis:\nIt is undoubtedly true that when Bell got his patent he thought the\nmagneto method was the best. Indeed, he said, in express terms,\nhe preferred it, but that does not exclude the use of the other if it\nturns out to be the most desirable way of using the process under any\n7United States Letters Patents Nos. 239, 742 and 240, 518, issued April 5 and 26, 1881,\nrespectively.\n\nCreate or Perish\ncircumstance. Both forms of apparatus operate on a closed circuit\nby gradual changes of intensity, and not by alternately making and\nbreaking the circuit.\nIt will be apparent hereinafter that the prior art came very close to Bell. The\nwhole distinction was that, instead of keeping the circuit closed all the time,\nand varying the current in it, the prior-art inventors interrupted the circuit,\nby actually make-and-break switching, which was unable to reproduce complex\nwaveforms, such as speech, although it could reproduce musical tones.\nThe court concluded (p. 539):\nSurely a patent for such a discovery is not to be confined to the mere\nmeans he improvised to prove the reality of its conception.\nHence, another important point of patent law. If an invention is a broad\ninvention, a court could construe it broadly. If the advance is a pioneer advance,\none cannot escape infringement by trying to obtain the same result in another\nequivalent way. This matter of range of equivalents returns again to the matter\nof the attitude of the court and its conclusion as to the scope of an invention. If\na court considers that a real advance has been made, and that the defendant is\nusing the substance of the invention, the range of equivalents may be broad. If,\non the other hand, a court considers the invention to be narrow, it may find the\nsomewhat different structures of the defendant to be noninfringing, by refusing\nto grant a substantial range of equivalent structures.\nNow I come to the details of the prior art set up by the defendants as\nanticipating Bell's invention.\nOne of the prior-art publications was that of\nBourseul in Paris, in 1854. This, it should be understood, was twenty-two years\nbefore Bell's invention. Here is what the Supreme Court held that Bourseul had\nin mind (p. 542):\nAs early as 1854 Bourseul, in his communication which has already\nbeen referred to, had said, substantially, that if the vibrations of air\nproduced by the human voice in articulate speech could be repro\nduced by means of electricity, at a distance, the speech itself would\nbe reproduced and heard there. As a means of stimulating inquiry\nto that end he called attention to the principle on which the electric\ntelegraph was based and suggested an application of that principle\nto such a purpose. He said \". . . Suppose that a man speaks nears\na movable disk, sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations\nof the voice, that this disk alternately makes and breaks connec\ntions with a battery, you have at a distance another disk which will\nsimultaneously execute the same vibrations.\"\nThis operation is show in Figure 4.\nBourseul, however, was merely proposing a problem insofar as speech was\nconcerned. He had everything there - almost. He was even proposing to use the\nprinciple of the telegraph to make the electric current vary the same way that\n\nPatents in Action\nFig. 4.3: Bourseul's make-and-break concept. (This image is public domain and\nis not protected by copyright.)\nthe voice vibrations vary. But note that he had in mind making and breaking\nthe electrical circuit.\nThe next prior art was that of Philip Reis of Germany, some fifteen years\nbefore Bell made his invention.\nReis's work involved a device for reproduc\ning musical sounds wherein a diaphragm moved back and forth in response to\nsound waves, and caused an arm correspondingly to move back and forth and\nmake and break the connection with an electric circuit. The Supreme Court\ninvited attention to Reis's own description of his apparatus as involving a sys\ntem wherein \"each sound wave causes a breaking and closing of the current.\"\nFigure 5 illustrates the Reis construction, as shown in a paper of von Legat,\nembodying a diaphragm c that moves an arm e into and out of contact with\na contact point d. The screw h can adjust the extent of this make-and-break\nadjustment. It could even produce Bell's kind of operation, if properly adjusted\nto that the circuit did not make and break, but gave rise to a variable-contact\nresistance phenomenon. This was proved by the experiments of Blake .\n8126 U.S. 196.\n\nCreate or Perish\nFig. 4.4: Philip Reis's construction. (This image is public domain and is not\nprotected by copyright.)\n\nPatents in Action\nProfessor Hunt 9 has an extremely interesting account of Reis's work in his\nbook already cited. Here briefly is his conclusion, as a scientist, as to the nature\nof Reis's work.\nIn spite of stout efforts to show the contrary, no evidence could be\nfound in Reis's writings that he had ever contemplated any mode of\noperation of his transmitter other than one involving complete inter\nruption of the current. What made this conclusion convincing was\nthe additional fact that his receiver was so insensitive that it could\nnot have produced an audible reproduction of speech even when his\ntransmitter was in the rare condition of adjustment necessary for\nthe production of an undulating current.\nThe Supreme Court summarized Reis's work as follows (p. 544):\nIt was left for Bell to discover that the failure was due not to work\nmanship but to the principle which was adopted as the basis of what\nhad to be done. He found that what he called the intermittent cur\nrent - one caused by alternately opening and closing the circuit -\ncould not be made under any circumstances to reproduce the deli\ncate forms of air vibrations caused by the human voice in articulate\nspeech, but that the true way was to operate on unbroken current\nby increasing and diminishing its intensity.\nSo, the court concluded,\nif Reis had kept on he might have found out the way to succeed, but\nhe stopped and failed. Bell took up his work and carried it on to a\nsuccessful result.\nLastly, with regard to the alleged prior investigation of Drawbaugh, the\nPeople's Telephone Company came upon this prolific inventor who, long after\nthe event, was prepared to claim having built a large number of telephones before\nBell. For some unexplained reason, he only had bits and pieces of them to show,\nnone of which worked. But he produced some fifty witnesses, farmers and the\nlike, all of whom swore that they had heard speech coming over these various\ninstruments long before Bell made his invention. In view of other circumstances\nthe majority of the court just could not believe this. While Drawbaugh had\nindicated that he did not have money to file patents and that he did not realize\nin time the significance of the invention, the court found that he had been able\nto raise money to file patents on other inventions, that he had gone with friends\nto a centennial exhibition at which Bell made a demonstration, and had seen\nBell's instrument, but never claimed to his friends that he had already done the\nsame. This distinct feeling of prior inventorship was apparently not brought\nout in Drawbaugh until after the People's Telephone Company had considered\nhim as a possible champion by whom to defeat Bell. The majority of the court\n9Frederick V. Hunt, Electroacoustics, p. 28.\n\nCreate or Perish\nfound that Drawbaugh did not make the invention before Bell, although three\njudges disagreed. So, by a 4-to-3 vote, two of the judges not participating, Bell's\npatent was sustained by the Supreme Court.\nIt may be relevant to point out that four days after delivering the majority\nopinion Chief Justice Waite died. What would have happened to Bell's patent\nwithout the persuasion of Chief Justice Waite? Suppose he had died a little\nearlier? Would there have been a 3-to-3 sustaining of the patent, or would no\nAmerican schoolchild today know of Alexander Graham Bell?\nAnother point of interest is the reluctance of the courts to trust oral testi\nmony, alone, with regard to dates of invention and demonstration 10 . If Draw\nbaugh had made the invention and had kept proper written records and mod\nels, these, together with the attestations of technically qualified witnesses, would\nhave undoubtedly led the majority of the court to a different conclusion\n. This\nis a lesson for the applied scientist and inventor on the importance of keeping\ndated records and models and having them witnessed by those who understand\nthe invention.\nAnother interesting fact is that Bell's invention gave rise to a situation\nwhereby, within the quarter of a century following it, more than 3000 patents\nare reported to have been issued for improvements relating to the telephone.\nSupposedly informed and well-meaning people have sometimes attacked that\npatent system as discouraging invention, because the pioneer gets a basic patent\nand can, for a limited time, exclude others.\nThe history of patents shows,\nhowever, that, far from discouraging invention, the system fosters and stimulates\na myriad of new devices to get around the patent or to improve upon it, in\norder to bargain for an exchange or rights, as demonstrated above. Truly this\naccomplishes the end set forth in the Constitution \"to promote the progress of\nscience and useful arts.\"\nIt is of interest, also, to note the considered opinion of Professor Edward\nL. Bowles, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has made a deep\nstudy of the history of the American Telephone Company and its subsidiaries.\nProfessor Bowles has reason to believe that the Telephone Company policy, with\nregard to equipment ownership, may well have resulted from the influence of the\nequipment-leasing policy of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation. It appears\nthat, while Bell has sometimes been credited with altruism in establishing the\npolicy of not requiring the telephone user to own his equipment, his financial\nbacker, G. G. Hubbard, was a close associate of Gordon McKay, the former\nguiding light of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation and its policy of leasing,\nnot selling, equipment.\n10See also American Optical Co. et al v. Shuron Optical Co., 9 F. 2d 932, 936.\n11There is always a question, however, whether it is in the public interest to give effect to\nan alleged prior invention that is suppressed to concealed or put aside and ignored. Does this\n\"promote the progress of useful arts\"? See, for example, Mason v. Hepburn, 84 O.G. 147.\n\nPatents in Action\n4.5\nHow Would Our Present Supreme Court Probably React to Bell's Patent?\nWhat might have been Bell's fate if he had to come before our Supreme Court\ntoday? We must assume, of course, that he had already obtained his patent,\nand had not already been worn out by interferences, in the Patent Office, with\none or more large corporations. As I shall show, later, such corporations have\nbeen notorious for provoking interferences by unwarrantably reading into one\nof their thousands of applications on file in the Patent Office an invention of an\noutsider that has come to their attention, and that they fear they might want to\nuse later. We must also assume that the patent has issued relatively promptly,\nso that well-financed copyists have not already been able to put the enterprising\ninventor out of business.\nFor purposes of analysis, we shall refer to the classic Supreme Court decision,\nJungerson v. Ostby and Barton Co..\nThe Supreme Court threw out a patent\nfor an invention dealing with centrifuging wax into a mold for the purpose of\nintricately reproducing designs in jewelry and the like. It did this in the face of\nthe fact that this invention had made possible novel results that had long been\nsought by the whole industry, that it was slavishly copied, once made known,\nand that it was the first technique ever to reproduce accurately and intricately\nthis kind of jewelry. The Supreme Court held (p. 563):\nJungerson's process is nothing more that a refinement of a method\nknown as \"cere perdue\" or \"lost wax\" process, which was in use as\nearly as the sixteenth century. The treatises of Benvenuto Cellini\n. . .\nThe prior art, the Supreme Court said, has been there for over 400 years; all\none had to do was use it!\nLet us draw the parallel, in Bell's situation, to Reis's work some fifteen years\nbefore Bell, and Bourseul's writings some seven years before that, which told\nthe world that, if one caused the undulations of the air produced by sounds to\nproduce corresponding variations in electric current, and employed telegraph\ntype apparatus therefore, the telephone would be born. Does this not correspond\nto Cellini's telling the world in the sixteenth century that one can use wax models\nfor goldsmithing, and to what the Supreme Court, in the Jungerson case, termed\nthe recognition, by those skilled in the art, of the necessity for making \"molten\nmaterials fit snugly the intricate details of the mold\"?\nJungerson's invention, the Supreme Court held, was merely \"a refinement\"\nof Cellini's method, including an application of centrifugal force thereto. Cer\ntainly Jungerson did not discover centrifugal force! Bell's invention similarly\ncould have resulted as before explained, merely by \"a refinement\" of Reis's\napparatus by proper adjustment of Reis's screw h.\nScrew adjustments were\ncertainly recognized before Bell!\nThe Supreme Court made a point of the fact that \"those skilled in the\nart recognized and disclosed the necessity for the application of force\" - though\n12335 U.S. 560.\n\nCreate or Perish\nnot, of course, of Jungerson's particular successful centrifugal-force action in this\ntechnique, a fact which, however, the court found to be \"of no legal significance\"\n(p. 566).\nThat no one before had ever produced Jungerson's long-sought result, despite\nCellini's age-old teaching and the recognition that a force was required, was of\nno significance to the court. Why, then, should the fact that no one had attained\nBell's results, despite Bourseul's teaching, be of any more significance? Had not\nBourseul himself \"recognized and disclosed the necessity for the application of\"\nelectrical undulations that would correspond to the voice sounds?\nThe answer may lie in the dissent in the Jungerson case. Justice Frankfurter,\nadopting the words of dissent of Judge Learned Hand of the Court of Appeals\nbelow, pointed out (pp. 569-570).\nMy point is that, if there is a new combination, however trifling the\nphysical change may be, nothing more is required than that, to take\nthe step or steps, added \"invention\" is needed, and the \"invention,\"\nwhatever else it may be, is within the category of mental activities\nand of those alone. . . . Indeed it is the very basis of the defense that\nfor years all the elements lay open and available, and that nothing\nwas needed but the paltry modification which has proved so fruitful.\n. . . What better test of invention can one ask than the detection of\nthat which others had all along had a strong incentive to discover,\nbut had failed to see, though all the while it lay beneath their eyes?\nBut the time has long since passed when we can afford to engage in pretenses.\nThe real philosophy, it seems to me, is involved in Justice Jackson's honest\nappraisal in his dissent (p. 572).\nIt is the strong passion in this Court for striking them [patents] down\nso that the only patent that is valid is one which this Court has not\nbeen able to get its hands on.\nThe reader is left to speculate whether Bell, before our present Supreme\nCourt, would have had his patent sustained, whether, today, he would find back\ners who would invest in such a speculative, risky, and revolutionary business,\nknowing that ultimately it would probably receive this same kind of treatment\nat the hands of the court, and whether we could today build a private-industry\nAmerican Bell Telephone system, with the remarkable advances and services\nit provides and which foreign government-owned telephone companies cannot\nbegin to approach, let alone match.\n\nChapter 5\nThe Rights, Obligations, and Problems of\nInventors (Employee-Employer Relations)\nStrongly threaded through the fabric of the invention-innovation cy\ncle is the interplay between inventor and employer and between in\nventor and potential user or licensee. These relationships, including\ntypical industrial, university, and governmental contract provisions,\nare herein set forth. Because the appropriation of inventions is a dif\nficult matter to prove - though it happens every day - reference is\nmade to one of the very rare proven instances, one that took several\ndecades to resolve - the pioneer piezoelectric circuit inventions. This\nmay aid in forewarning the inventor of the pitfalls in his path and\nin encouraging business and government to recognize rather than to\ncircumvent or try to destroy the proprietary position of independent\ninventors.\nIn this era of conformity and considerable abdication of the right to negotiate\nemployment terms and conditions, engineers and applied scientists appear to\nknow little about their obligations to employers or to the firms who hire them\nas consultants, especially in the matter of inventions and patents. It may be\nin order, therefore, first to deal briefly with some general principles of law,\nand then to examine the policies of some of our leading institutions, industrial,\neducational, and governmental, as well as specific current contract provisions.\nWhether an agreement between an employer and an employee relating to the\ndisposition of patents and inventions is oral or in writing does not matter. Long\nago, in England, a so-called Statute of Frauds 1 was enacted for the purpose\nof preventing litigation in cases almost impossible to resolve, involving certain\nkinds of oral contracts. The plaintiff would allege the terms of an oral agreement,\nand the defendant would deny those terms. There was no written evidence to\nprove the contentions of either side. How could the court resolve the dispute?\nThe Statute of Frauds, therefore, made certain kinds of contracts unenforceable,\nunless in writing. American law has adopted this Statute of Frauds, but an\n129 Chas. II.\n\nCreate or Perish\noral agreement in which an employee undertakes to assign his invention to his\nemployer is not included in the oral agreements that the courts will refuse to\nenforce under the Statute. They will enforce it if it can be proved to exist .\nWhile an actual assignment of a patent must conform to a specific statutory\nprovision that requires a writing, the understanding between employer and em\nployee as to who is to own the invention or patent may be oral. Now, how do\nyou prove the oral agreement? One way is to examine the relation between and\nthe conduct of the parties, which may cast light upon the rights of the several\nparties. The mere relation of employer and employee does not, of itself, mean\nthat the employee is obligated to assign his invention to the employer.\nAs an illustration, if one is employed by a corporation as a sales engineer or as\na secretary, and makes inventions extremely useful to the employer, including,\neven, improvements upon the employer's products, those inventions are the\nemployee's property, in the absence of an understanding to the contrary. And it\nmakes no difference what kind of employer is involved. The employer may be a\ncorporation, an individual, a university, or the United States Government. The\nlast situation was decided by the Supreme Court :\nAn employee, performing all the duties assigned to him in his depart\nment of service, may exercise his inventive faculties in any direction\nhe chooses, with the assurance that whatever invention he may thus\nconceive and perfect is his individual property.\nWhy is this so? Perhaps the best answer is another illustration.\nLet us\nsuppose that a man is employed as a mill carpenter. He receives his salary in\nreturn for performing duties as a carpenter. It so happens, however, that he is\nobservant and thoughtful, and one day has an inspiration as to how to make a\nnew type of floor rack, which could well be used even in his employer's business.\nShould this invention belong to the employer for either legal or moral reasons?\nCertainly the employer did not include inventing as one of the carpenter's duties,\nand he certainly had not paid the carpenter for using his inventive abilities.\nNow this is the test. Was the employee being paid for the purpose of making\ninventions?\nWere his duties merely those of carpenter or was he employed\nspecifically to make inventions?\nIn just such a case the court held:\nIt is true that at the time he made and disclosed the invention to the\ndefendant, ... [he] was one of its employees. His work, however, was\nthat of mill carpenter. It had nothing whatever to do with floor racks\nor floor rack hinges. In no sense can it be said that his invention\nwas made in the course of his employment 4 .\nIf the understanding is that an employee is a sales engineer, a secretary,\na director, and that he is employed to perform the customary duties of such\n2Dalzell v. Dueber Manf. Co., 149 U.S. 315, 320.\n3Solomons v. U.S., 137 U.S. 342.\n4Massie v. Fruit Growers Express Co., 31 F. 2d 463, 466.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nemployment, this is not an understanding that the employee is expected to\ninvent. In the absence of further rights defined by contract between the parties,\nanything such an employee may invent is his own property, no matter how he\nwas stimulated to make the invention. This is the general rule of law.\nIt has previously been pointed out that sometimes government officials in\nthe United States think they should have special rights that others do not have.\nThis kind of tactic has been rejected by prior Supreme Courts :\nThe government has no more power to appropriate a man's property\ninvested in a patent than it has to take his property invested in real\nestate; nor does the mere fact that an inventor is at the time of his\ninvention in the employ of the government transfer to it any title to,\nor interest in it.\nThis is important, because we shall see very shortly what the government short\nsightedly demands today by way of special contract, both from direct employees\nand from people working under contract for the government.\nNow, let us consider a slightly different situation. Let us suppose another\ncase of an individual who is not employed for the purpose of inventing, but who\ndoes, nevertheless, make an invention. Assume, also, that he uses his employer's\nfacilities and the services of other fellow employees to perfect this invention. Is\nit still the inventor's property? Yes - but this time the employer is contributing\nsomething to further the invention. Under such circumstances, a so-called \"shop\nright\" for the employer is created: the employer acquires a nonexclusive, royalty\nfree, irrevocable, personal license to use the invention himself. He cannot give\nthis license to anyone else; it is personal with him, and he may use the invention\nroyalty-free. The invention, however, still belongs to the employee.\nConsider now a situation involving an employee of the United States Gov\nernment. The employee is a naval officer, and his duties involve devising plans\nto protect the Philippines. If he finds a method and apparatus for adapting\ntorpedoes to airplanes, the question arises whether his assigned duties implied\nmaking inventions such as this. If it does, the invention belongs to the govern\nment. At the very least, however, these facts\nestablish an irrevocable license in the government to the use of plain\ntiff's invention and patent 6 .\nIn another case\n, an industrial chemist employed by the Public Health\nService was relieved of his duties so that he might try to solve a particular\nproblem at the Edgewood Arsenal; but he was still paid his regular salary. This\nis not the case of an invention made by an employee whose duties of employment\ndo not contemplate conceiving and perfecting an invention. In such a case, the\ncourt reiterated, \"the rule is that the invention is the property of the employee.\"\nNor is this a case where the only claim of the employer arises out of the fact\n5See above, fn. 3.\n6Moffett v. Riske, 51 F. 2d 868, 870.\n7Houghton v. U.S., 23 F. 2d 386.\n\nCreate or Perish\nthat the employee used the property of his employer and the services of other\nemployees to develop his invention, and has assented to the employer's use of\nthe latter. Here, the court again reiterated, \"the invention is the property of\nthe employee, subject to an irrevocable license on the part of the employer to\nuse it\"; that is, a \"shop right.\"\nThe case presented here is rather that of an employee who makes an invention\nwhile employed to conduct experiments for the purpose of making it.\nThe\ncourt drew no distinction between work for the Public Health Service and that\nperformed at the Edgewood Arsenal and paid for by the government. Thus,\nconcluded the court,\nhe did merely that which he was being paid his salary to do. Un\nder such circumstances, we think there can be no doubt that his\ninvention is the property of his employer, the United States.\nIt is interesting to contrast this case with that involving two engineer em\nployees of the Radio Section of the Bureau of Standards 8 . These men were\nassigned to various radio-research projects for the government. They conceived\nan idea in the very same radio field that was of use in commercial equipment,\nnamely of constructing a power pack for operating from the mains to supply\nplate voltage for radio receivers without resort to B-batteries. They obtained\npatents for this invention and granted an exclusive license thereunder to the Du\nbilier Condenser Corporation, but reserving to the government a nonexclusive\nlicense, because of their use of government facilities for perfecting this inven\ntion. The government, believing that it was entitled to complete ownership of\nthe patents, not just a nonexclusive free license, brought suit to obtain a court\ndecree to such effect. As the court explained:\nThe United States is not content with such licenses and seeks in\nthese three suits ... to obtain a decree compelling the defendant's\nright, title, and interest in the patents.\nThe test applied by the court was whether or not the inventions arose as a result\nof the employment of the engineers to solve certain problems for the government.\nThe court concluded that their superior had given no specific instruction to\nengage in any research problem involving the inventions in controversy. That\nis the important point. While the engineers were instructed, as part of their\nemployment, to engage in certain research projects and problems in the radio\nfield, these had nothing to do with eliminating batteries in radios. The court\nfound, accordingly, that\nthe most that can be said is that Lowell and Dunmore were per\nmitted by Dr. Dellinger, after the inventions had been brought to\nhis attention, to pursue their work in the laboratory and perfect the\ninventions which had theretofore been made by them.\n8U.S. v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 49 F. 2d 306.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nThe court refused to hold that all patents of research workers in the Radio\nSection of the Bureau of Standards belong to the United States, unless there was\na special agreement. Only those patents dealing with inventions made within\nthe specific scope of the employment would become government property.\n5.1\nUniversity and Government Relations\nIn the light of these principles of law, it is in order to examine the manner in\nwhich various educational and business entities contract with their employees.\nConsider first Harvard University. Harvard has adopted the attitude, fully con\nsistent with the general law, that a student or a professor is not employed nor\ngiven facilities for the purpose of inventing, and so any inventions that he may\nmake become his own property, which he may do with as he desires. There is,\nhowever, one exception adopted under President Lowell's time under the impe\ntus of a certain unpleasantness in connection with the respirator invention of Dr.\nPhilip Drinker. No member of the university may now take out a patent that\nis concerned primarily with the field of public health or therapeutics without\nthe consent of the President and Fellow of Harvard College (the legal name of\nthe governing body of the university). While embarrassment may be created\nin other fields, apparently nothing is quite so touchy, from the public relations\nangle, as public health.\nIn connection with government contracts, however, Harvard's policy is con\nsiderably modified.\nThe United States Government requires in its contracts\nwith Harvard that the latter assume certain obligations, among them that its\nstaff and other people working at Harvard under government contracts shall\ngrant the government certain rights. The general Harvard-employee agreement,\nin connection with work under a government contract, commences as follows:\nIn order to enable Harvard University to fulfill its obligation under\nContract between the President and Fellows of Harvard College and\nthe United States Government and as a condition of my employment.\n...\nThen comes a term used over and over again in government contracts - \"sub\nject invention.\" Most government departments require that if, during the per\nformance of a contract, an employee under the contract conceives an invention\nfor the first time, or first actually reduces it to practice by constructing and\noperating it successfully under the contract, the government shall have a free\nright to practice that invention and to have the invention made for it by other\npeople. Hence, in this employee agreement, a so-called \"subject invention\" is\ndefined in the following terms:\nAny invention, improvement, or discovery (whether or not patentable)\nconceived or first actually reduced to practice by me ... either (A) in\nthe performance of work called for or required under said contract,\nor (B) in the performance of ... work ... which was done upon an\nunderstanding in writing that a contract would be awarded.\n\nCreate or Perish\nIn connection with such invention, the employee agrees and thereby grants\nto the United States Government irrevocable, nonexclusive, non\ntransferable and royalty-free license to practice, and cause to be\npracticed by or for the Government throughout the world, each\n\"Subject Invention.\"\nThe employee also agrees to disclose the invention promptly to his contracting\nofficer. Under this particular contract, the employee has an option\neither to\nfile the patent application himself or to give the government the opportunity to\ndo so. The employee may thus have the commercial nongovernmental rights to\nhis invention if he exercises the first option.\nIt will be recalled that certain bars to obtaining a patent reside in the pub\nlication of the invention, or public use or sale in this country of the invention,\nmore than a year before the application is filed. Under this government con\ntract, therefore, the employee agrees to notify the project director, not later\nthan eight months after any such publication, public use, or sale of his inven\ntion, that he does not intend to file an application. The government will then\nhave four months in which to file an application, if so minded. Furthermore the\ngovernment demands the right to reproduce copyrightable material, data, plans,\nspecifications, without any interference whatsoever; and such rights are granted\ntogether with the patent licenses under these contracts. A similar agreement is\nexecuted by the project director himself, the terms of the employee agreement\nbeing directly incorporated by reference into his own.\nNow let us turn to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Institute\nhas a little different philosophy. It concurs with Harvard only to the extent that\ninventions or developments made by the staff members, and not related to any\nInstitute program of research with which the members may be concerned and\nto which the Institute does not contribute any funds,\nshall be the exclusive property of the individual producing the inven\ntion or development. The Institute will not construe the payment\nof salary or the provision of normal academic environment as con\nstituting grounds for equity by the Institute in such invention.\nFormerly, if a staff member or student made an invention in which the Insti\ntute had an equity, patent applications were usually filed through the Research\nCorporation of New York City, a nonprofit organization that endeavors to pro\nmote inventions in order to obtain funds for further research. Net income from\nthe inventions, after expenses, was divided equally between the Research Cor\nporation and the Institute, the latter employing such receipts to further its\nown educational and research policies. The inventor normally received 12 per\ncent of the gross royalties that the Research Corporation negotiated under the\ninvention.\nAt present, arrangements with the Research Corporation have been termi\nnated, and it remains to be seen what new policies will be adopted. The actual\n9Army, Navy, and Air Force contracts.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\npaucity of patents stemming from the millions of dollars spent in research at\nM.I.T. should cause consideration over the kind of policy that will stimulate\nthe staff to carry new discoveries and techniques to the patentable invention\nstage. As at Harvard, the Institute staff must execute the previously discussed\ninvention and copyright agreements, in connection with government contracts.\nA little different situation arises in connection with contracts with the Atomic\nEnergy Commission. It will be recalled that the law prohibits the granting of\npatents in the field of atomic energy when those patents relate primarily to the\nproduction of fissionable material, processes, or instrumentalities used in the\nproduction of such material, or in weapons themselves. Consequently, the AEC\ntakes a somewhat stronger position and declines to let the inventor himself file\nfor a patent. Instead, it claims the right to decide who shall own the invention.\nUnder an AEC patent clause, therefore, the following provision is set forth:\nWhenever any such invention or discovery results from such work\npaid for in whole or in part from Commission funds ... the Com\nmission shall have the sole power to determine whether or not and\nwhere a patent application shall be filed.\nEven if the contractor spends his own money under an AEC contract to make\nan invention, the AEC demands certain rights. Under those circumstances, the\nCommission\nshall retain at least a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license\nunder said invention, discovery, application for patent.\nUnder the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, the administra\ntor, through appropriate determinations and unless he waives the government's\nrights, is empowered to claim for the United States the exclusive right to inven\ntion under this program. If these restrictions remain, only history can record\nwhether American industry and the American inventor will be actually stimu\nlated and challenged by these provisions, or by the system of monetary awards\nfor significant scientific or technical contributions to aeronautical and space\nactivities, that Section 306 of the Act empowers the administrator to grant.\nRecent congressional hearings have not, in my view, resulted in any real change\nof attitude.\n5.2\nSummary of Current Governmental Agency Regulations Concerning Patents\nThe Department of Defense, as provided by Section IX of the Armed Services\nProcurement Regulations, acquires a royalty-free, nonexclusive license to make\nand have any inventions arising under its research and development contracts,\nand acquires no license or other patent rights on contracts involving the delivery\nof supplies or products. Similar policies govern contracts of the Veterans' Ad\nministration, the Post Office Department (which agrees not to use its license to\ncompete with the contractor or its commercial licensees), and the General Ser\nvices Administration. Under the Research and Marketing Act, the Department\n\nCreate or Perish\nof Agriculture requires that inventions resulting from its research and develop\nment contracts be either dedicated to the public or assigned to the government\nfor the issuance of royalty-free, nonexclusive licenses to qualified parties.\nThe Department of Health, Education and Welfare reserves the right of\nthe government to determine the ownership and the disposition of inventions\nflowing from its research and development contracts. In the case of industrial\nresearch contracts in the field of cancer chemotherapy, on the other hand, the\nright to patent may be left with the contractor, but with that right vested in\nthe Surgeon General to protect the public interest, as, for example, by assuring\nroyalty-free, nonexclusive licenses to own the public.\nNonprofit institutional\ncontractors may also own patents on inventions arising under a research and\ndevelopment contract, subject to stipulations necessary to protect the public\ninterest.\nWhile the Department of the Interior has a present policy of attempting\nto have patents assigned to the government, it will, in the case of recalcitrant\ncontractors, accept a royalty free, irrevocable, nonexclusive license. The Depart\nment of Commerce also follows a flexible course as to whether the government is\nto own patents or obtain a royalty-free nonexclusive license. In the case of Mar\nitime Administration research and development contracts, the same provision is\napplied to marine research, but the patent provisions of the Atomic Energy Act\nof 1946, as amended, are employed where nuclear material or atomic energy is\ninvolved. That Act, under which the Atomic Energy Commission also operates,\nrequires the retention by the government of the sole power to determine and\ndispose of patent rights.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, previously alluded to, was\nmodeled after the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, as amended, and requires even\nmore broadly that the Administration itself shall be deemed to have made or\nconceived any invention or discovery \"made or conceived under any contract,\nsubcontract, arrangement, or other relationship with the Administrator, regard\nless of whether the contract or arrangement involved the expenditure of funds by\nthe Administrator.\"\nMerely discussing an idea with the Administrator would, if this Space Act\nprovision is literally interpreted, be a \"relationship\" or \"arrangement\" that\nwould vest all rights in the government.\nIt is small wonder that many rep\nresentatives of American industry, science, and law have protested this wording\nof the statute 10 , and that proposed revisions are under consideration. Indeed,\nthe principal finding of a recent thorough two-year study by the Denver Re\nsearch Institute is that only negligible commercial inventions have spun off from\nthe multi-million-dollar NASA research programs: about six patent applications\nfiled each year of the life of NASA for developments from NASA-funded con\ntracts. How long does government have to wait to learn that few companies\nwith real competence and backbone will produce under this kind of so-called\nstimulus?\n10\"Property Rights and Inventions made under Federal Space Research Contracts,\" Hearings\nbefore the House Subcommittee on Patents and Scientific Inventions of the Committee on\nScience and Astronautics, 85th Congress, 1st Session (1959).\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nAn analogy to Soviet philosophy is striking evident, as discussed in a Con\ngressional report on proposed revisions\n:\nContrasts were drawn between the American patent system and its\noperation, on the one hand, and the Soviet patent system and its\nmethod of operation, on the other. The argument goes about as\nfollows: Whereas the American patent system depends upon free\nand open competition for commercial markets, the Soviet system\ndepends upon a determination by the Government as to the eco\nnomic or commercial necessity of producing an article as a basis for\nits industrial operation. There is some similarity between the so-\ncalled patents of the Soviet system and the wording of sections 305\nand 306 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (which\nare substantially the same as patent and compensation or award\nprovisions of the Atomic Energy Act). The Government ownership\nprovisions of the NASA and AEC statutes, if carried out literally,\nwould correspond to the \"public patents\" provision of the Soviet\nsystem in that there can be no private commercialization of the in\nventions with Government approval. The \"compensation or award\"\nprovisions of the NASA and AEC statutes correspond to the \"private\npatent\" provisions of the Russian system in that the inventor will\nnot be rewarded unless the Government allows commercialization or\nuse of the invention in the interest of the public.\n5.3\nIndustrial Employment Agreements\nLet us now turn to industrial organizations. Two typical illustrations of employer\nemployee contracts are provided by the General Electric Company and the Radio\nCorporation of America. The General Electric Company does not treat invent\ning engineers as a class separate from other employees. It provides a sweeping\nprovision \"in consideration of my employment in any capacity\" If one wants\nthe position, therefore, he agrees that \"all inventions made or conceived by me\n. . . from the time of entering the Company's employ until I leave\" will be the\nsole and exclusive property of General Electric. There is a qualification, how\never. Only two fields of invention are so included, namely inventions which are\nalong the \"lines of business, work or investigations of the Company . . . or which\nresult from or are suggested by any work which I may do for or on behalf of\nthe Company.\" The employee then agrees to assist GE in obtaining the patent\nand to keep adequate written records of the invention, the records to remain\nthe property of the company.\nAnother important clause covers matters with which a company, as distin\nguished from a university, is vitally concerned. Some things, as I have previously\nnoted, are not susceptible of patent protection, or there is no purpose in patent\ning them. Know-how and trade secrets are in this category. The general rule\n11\"Proposed Revisions to the Patent Section, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958,\"\nmarch 8, 1960 (Mimeo).\n\nCreate or Perish\nis that a confidential relationship exists between employer and employee, and\nthat the employee is not free to disclose trade secrets, even after leaving the\nemployer.\nIn an interesting recent case, for example, the makers of Rise instant shaving\ncream, the Carter Company, sued the Colgate Company for patent infringement\nand for unfair competition in hiring one of the key employees (the inventor)\naway from the Carter Company and using the trade secrets that the employee\nhad acquired 12 . The court not only sustained the patent, but also awarded\nattorney's fees and costs because of the wanton character of Colgate's action in\nhiring away an employee and using trade secrets that he had obtained in his\nprior employment.\nIn order to have this protection in writing, and not be compelled to rely\non the general rule alone, however, the General Electric Company employment\nagreement states that, as a condition of employment, the employee agrees \"not\nto disclose at any time either during or subsequent to my employment, any in\nformation, knowledge or data of the Company . . . relating to formulas, business\nprocesses, methods, machines, manufactures, compositions, inventions, discov\neries or otherwise, which is of a secret or confidential nature 13.\"\nIn the second example, the corresponding employment agreement of the\nRadio Corporation of America does not apply to all employees. The patent\nagreement is restricted to employment in a capacity where the employee is\n\"reasonably expected to make new contributions and inventions.\" So if one is\nemployed as a janitor or a secretary at RCA, he still has the common-law right\nto inventions, even if stimulated by what he has seen in the RCA laboratory.\nThe employee who is expected to invent agrees to assign all inventions, made\nduring employment, that relate to the business or interests of the company,\nor that result from tasks assigned by the company. In order to safeguard its\nobligations under government contracts, however, RCA requires that even if it\nemploys a person in an occupation where he is not expected to invent, and where\nthere is normally no obligation to assign inventions, RCA obtains rights under\ntwo exceptions; if the employment is under a government contract, and if the\nwork is intended to lead to the granting of a government contract. The RCA\nagreement, like that of other companies, excludes all inventions made prior to\nemployment with the company.\nA few words now about the way in which the employer compensates the\ninventor for his inventions. Recently a very liberal policy was reported to have\nbeen adopted by a relatively small company\n, that not only pays a token\nsum of $25 when patent application is filed and another $50 when the patent\nis granted, but also agrees to pay to the employee, as a stimulus to invention,\nroyalties starting with 10 per cent of the net cash royalties that may come from\nlicensing others. Most companies, of course, have no such policy. GE pays a\nbonus of $100, partly in cash and party in company stock, upon the filing of the\n12Carter v. Colgate Palmolive Company, 230 F. 2d 855.\n13The terms \"confidential\" and \"secret\" are used in the ordinary sense and not in the\ngovernment security sense.\n14Electronic Manufacturing (a monthly newssheet), Oct., 1957, p. 115.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\napplication. RCA also pays $100 upon the filing of the application. This is based\nupon the belief that it is frequently impossible to determine what important\ncontributions may have been made to the development by employees other than\nthose whom the law identifies as \"inventors.\" To attempt to approximate an\nevaluation for \"inventions\" only and to make individual payments based on\nsuch evaluations to \"inventors\" could, it is stated, result in inequities and could\nhamper team play, a result which, in turn, would slow down progress. Instead,\nreward comes at GE by promotion in position and salary.\nAnother interesting topic is the situation when engineers and applied scien\ntists approach outside companies, asking them to consider ideas and inventions\nwith a possible view to negotiating a license agreement. Two illustrations will\nsuffice to show the reason for the present attitude of the large companies.\nAn individual suggested an advertising idea to the manufacturer of Chester\nfield cigarettes, indicating that he expected reasonable compensation if the com\npany used it. The company never replied, but several years later its advertising\nagency, which purportedly had never seen the submitter's idea, hit upon a very\nsimilar proposal. The company adopted this proposal and was thereupon sued\nby the original submitted for misappropriation of his idea. A sizable jury verdict\nfor the plaintiff was sustained by the Supreme Court of Indiana.\nThe second case is that of a manufacturer of three-way light bulbs. In order\nto avoid adverse publicity, and because it was difficult to prove independent\nconception, it settled a suit out of court for a reported $150,000 with a stranger\nto it, but who had some years earlier voluntarily sent it a similar idea.\nIn order to protect themselves, therefore, many companies will absolutely\nrefuse to receive any disclosures from outsiders, unless the disclosure is covered\nby a filed patent application, or unless the submitter agrees that there is no\nconfidential relation involved in the disclosure and that he will rely upon his\npatent rights alone. Only under these conditions will these companies receive\nfor examination an outsider's invention.\n5.4\nThe Problems and Dangers in Negotiation - One of the Rare Proven Cases\nThe dangers inherent in making such disclosure need examination, however, as\nwell as the shameful record of certain large companies in dealing improperly\nwith eminent men of science and of the engineering profession, in order that the\nrisks involved may be understood.\nProfessor Frederick V. Hunt describes some of these risks in resume form\n15 . His account, which constitutes an important part of the history of radio,\nwill now be supplemented by additional information relating to past experiences\nin connection with inventions submitted to the Western Electric Company and\nto the International Telephone and Telegraph Company. These are among the\nvery, very few instances where such conduct was actually exposed; and even\nhere it took several decades to prove.\nWe shall begin with the piezoelectric crystal and circuit inventions of Pro\nfessor Walter G. Cady, formerly of Wesleyan University. Dr. Cady's name is\n15Frederick V. Hunt, Electroacoustics, pp. 23 - 25.\n\nCreate or Perish\nextremely well known in the electronics field as one of the pioneers in stabiliz\ning electric oscillations with the aid of quartz crystals. During World War I,\nhe was one of a number of American scientists engaged in trying to solve the\nsubmarine problem. He heard about the work of Professor Paul Langevin, in\nFrance, who had found that he could employ Curie's discovery of piezoelectric\nity for submarine detection: if sound energy from a submarine strikes a quartz\nplate, the piezoelectric effect will produce a small voltage that can be detected.\nConversely, if an alternating voltage is applied to the crystal, the crystal will\nbe forced to vibrate and to transmit sound into the water. This was the kind\nof apparatus with which Cady and a number of others were concerned at New\nLondon.\nAfter the war, Cady continued his investigations with these quartz devices\nand made several inventions which were lumped together into two patents 16 .\nWhen it was appreciated that more than one invention actually was involved in\neach of these patents, applications for so-called \"reissue patents\" were filed.\nA reissue patent may be granted under the following circumstances. If one\nhas, through inadvertence, made a mistake in his patent, or has failed to appre\nciate or understand the true scope of the invention, he may in certain instances\nrefile that patent. This does not result in extending the patent \"monopoly\"\nsince the reissue patent dates from the issue of the original patent, but at least\nthe patentee will have an accurate patent.\nThis is what happened to Cady, so that his original patents were released as a\ngroup of reissue patents 17 . Included in these inventions were what have become\nknown as the crystal stabilizer and the crystal-controlled oscillator. Figure 6\nshows in Fig. 3 of the patent drawing an electron tube 4 having an input tuned\ncircuit comprising coil 7 and condenser 9 and an output circuit having a coil\n8 coupled to the coil 7 to form an \"Armstrong oscillator,\" the frequency of\nwhich is controlled primarily by the values of the coils and the condenser. Cady\ndiscovered that if a piece of quartz were connected into this circuit at 12, then,\nin a very narrow range of adjustment of this oscillating circuit, a phenomenon\ntook place in the circuit (region 4 in Figs. 5 and 6 of the patent drawing) where\nthe crystal seemed to lock the frequency. If the condenser 9 was adjusted a bit\nfurther, the crystal lost control, so that the crystal could stabilize the oscillator\nonly over a very limited range. That is the stabilizer invention.\nCady also found that if he employed a long bar of quartz, as shown at 12 in\nFig. 2, connecting one end of the quartz to the input 1-4 of the first tube of a\ntrain of amplifiers and the other end of the quartz to the output 5 of the last\namplifier, the quartz bar 12 would itself mechanically couple energy between\noutput and input, and sustain oscillations without the use of coils and con\ndensers, and at a frequency controlled and determined by the dimensions of the\n16U.S. Patents Nos. 1,450,246 (April 3, 1923) and 1,472,583 (Oct. 30, 1923).\n17Reissue Patents Nos.\n17,245 (four-electrode crystal stabilizer); 17,246 (four-electrode\ncrystal oscillator); 17,247 (crystal stabilizer for \"Armstrong\" oscillator); 17,355 (piezoelectric\ncrystal resonator); 17,356 (piezoelectric crystal wavemeter); 17,357 (crystal resonator cou\npled to another medium); 17,358 (filter embodying piezoelectric crystal); and 17,358 (crystal\nresonator coupling two circuits).\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nbar of quartz. In view of the inherent necessary size of the four-electrode crystal\nbar, the frequency of oscillations was not very high. This was, nonetheless, the\nfirst crystal-controlled oscillator.\nFig. 5.1: Cady's patent drawing.\n(This image is public domain and is not\nprotected by copyright.)\n\nCreate or Perish\nAnd so, very excited about these developments, Cady went to the logical\ncorporate giants in the field of communications and solicited the interest of\nthe American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Western Electric\nCompany, Inc., in his inventions. He freely disclosed all of his patent application,\npermitted the company engineers, including his former student, H. D. Arnold,\nthe director of research, to visit his laboratory at Wesleyan University on several\noccasions, and freely gave the company samples of his apparatus. Cady expected\nthat the company was evaluating this material in order to decide whether or\nnot to use his invention and thus to take a license. Let us see, however, the\ndilemma in which Cady soon found himself.\nOnly recently has it been admitted\nthat, as far back as June 1924,\nthe American Telephone and Telegraph Company began utilizing a quartz-\ncrystal oscillator to obtain constant-frequency oscillations for a radio trans\nmitter. Cady's affidavit in the record before the District Court in Pierce v.\nAmerican Communications Company, Inc..\nsays:\nThe engineers of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company\nand Western Electric Company, Incorporated, concealed this fact\nfrom me, and, on the contrary, led me to believe that piezoelectric\ncrystals were not of any commercial value to them.\nThe letters Cady has received appear as Plaintiff's Exhibit CXXI in this\nsuit. They state that the company had no interest in the inventions, though the\nfacts now show that they had already appropriated them, unknown to Cady.\nAs if this were not enough, Cady continues:\nI was suddenly plunged into the said Interference 50, 545, Cady v.\nNicolson, under the claim that the said Alexander McLean Nicolson\nhad made all three of my inventions . . . long before I did 20 .\nAnd Cady further stated that this interference was based upon claims that\nwere copied in exactly the form that they were in at the time I gave\nsaid copies of my patent applications to Dr. Arnold, in 1921.\n\"Concealment\" and \"interference\" were thus the rewards that this eminent man\nof science received from this gigantic company with which he had been dealing\nfrankly and freely.\nNow, on what basis did the Western Electric and American Telephone and\nTelegraph attorneys claim that Nicolson had made these inventions? The record\nshows that, upon Arnold's return from a Washington conference in 1917, where\nthe work of Langevin with piezoelectric crystals had been disclosed by the French\nand British to a group of American scientists, Nicolson was set upon the problem\nof developing Langevin's work. He did make some original contributions with\n18Raymond A. Heising, Quartz Crystals for Electrical Circuits, Van Nostrand, 1946.\n19111 F. Supp. 181.\n20Nicolson was an engineer in the employ of Western Electric Company, Inc.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nRochelle salt crystals as Hunt's account explained 21 . Figure 7 shows part of\nNicolson's original patent, the application for which was filed April 10, 1918.\n21Frederick V. Hunt, Electroacoustics. p. 52.\n\nCreate or Perish\nFig. 5.2: A part of Nicolson's original patent.\nClaim 12 reads, \"Means for\ntranslating acoustical energy into electrical energy, a space current device hav\ning a control member, and a connection between said means and said device,\nsaid means comprising a substance capable of generating electromotive force in\nresponse to a change in pressure.\" (This image is public domain and is not\nprotected by copyright.)\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nIn Fig. 12 of the patent, a Rochelle salt crystal 53 is placed in a tunnel near the\nenemy trench. The crystal is connected to a pair of earphones 54 so that the en\nemy movements can be detected. As one modification, the crystal may modulate\nan alleged electric oscillator (Fig. 11 of the patent), and an antenna may trans\nmit the oscillation signals to a remote receiver, instead of using wires between\nthe Rochelle salt crystal picking up vibrations and the earphones. That was\nNicolson's original case. One of his first claims (12) specified the combination of\ncrystal means comprising a substance capable of generating electromotive force\nin response to a change of pressure for translating acoustical energy into electri\ncal energy, the space-current oscillator tube 50, and a connection between the\ntranslating means and the tube. But how can this possibly bear upon Cady's\ncrystal-controlled oscillator, where the crystal is used not to pick up sounds,\nbut, on the contrary, to determine and generate the oscillation frequency itself?\nHow can there be an interference?\nThe American Telephone and Telegraph attorneys, having inspected Cady's\npatent applications before permitting the Nicolson patent to issue, split this Fig.\n11 out, and made it the subject matter of a so-called \"divisional applications.\"\nThat is, where there is more than one invention disclosed in an application,\nthe additional invention may be divided out and made the subject matter of a\nseparate application, being, however, entitled to the filing date of the original\napplication. So the American Telephone and Telegraph Company now had an\napplication with an early 1918 filing date, showing an oscillator and a crys\ntal, though, in the words of Judge Ford, in the case of Pierce v. American\nCommunications Company, Inc., the original Nicolson disclosure\nshows only the use of the crystal as the equivalent of a telephone\ntransmitter or a microphone. He teaches nothing about the control\nof the frequency of the oscillations.\nArmed with an effective early-date application showing an oscillator and a\ncrystal, irrespective of its operation as originally described and intended, the\nAmerican Telephone and Telegraph attorneys copied Cady's claims from his\npatent applications, and so provoked the before-mentioned interference.\nAs\nJudge Ford pointed out, it was not until \"after Cady had made his disclosures\"\nthat the Nicolson circuit allegedly became a crystal-controlled oscillator.\nSo Professor Cady found himself enmeshed in a legal contest with the gi\nant American Telephone and Telegraph. He thereupon sold out to the Radio\nCorporation of America. Hunt explains how, through improper handing, the\nclaims that belonged to Professor Cady were later awarded to Nicolson. Thus,\none finds in the Nicolson patent the claims for Cady's invention, namely a de\nvice where the circuit is stably nonoscillatory when not under the control of\nthe crystal vibrator, and where the frequency of oscillations, when the system\noscillates, is stably determined by the frequency of vibration of the vibrator.\nThe significance of that improper handling is evident from Judge Ford's later\ndetermination in Pierce v. American Communications Company, Inc.\nIndeed it appears that although Nicolson may have believed he had\n\nCreate or Perish\na crystal-controlled oscillator, in fact he did not. Professor Cady\nshowed by his later experiments with the Nicolson circuit that os\ncillations were not controlled by the crystal but were determined by\nthe other elements of the circuit. The evidence of Professor Edward\nL. Bowles' affidavit is to the effect that the function of the crystal in\nthe Nicolson circuit is to modulate the oscillations (the only function\nhe originally claims for them, and the basis for his earlier patent)\nand not to control their frequency.\nDefendant has introduced pages from Nicolson's note book written\nin 1918 . . . Dr. F. W. Kranz, who signed these pages as witness,\ntestified that Nicolson at that time said nothing to indicate he had\ndiscovered that crystals could be used to control the frequency of the\noscillations, nor did Nicolson make any such claim when he originally\nfiled his application in 1918.\n5.5\nProfessor Cady Was Not Alone\nThe A T & T, however, was not partial only to Professor Cady.\nTake the\napplication of Professor Langevin, who was thousands of miles away in France.\nLangevin's application showed a quartz crystal driven by alternating-current os\ncillations in a coil to generate sounds. Conversely, sound waves striking the crys\ntal would be converted into electric energy and received. This was Langevin's\ninvention.\nSo into the Nicolson application went a claim reading, \"An oscillating cir\ncuit comprising a piezoelectric device.\" This is, of course, what Langevin had\ninvented. An interference was declared. Langevin complained that French rep\nresentatives, Majors M. Fabry and H. Abraham, had disclosed his invention to\na whole group of scientists, including Dr. Arnold and others of the Western\nElectric Company, as before mentioned, before Nicolson's 1918 filing date. But\nagain A T & T prevailed. Nicolson was awarded priority, because Langevin's\nlong-distance stipulated proofs were not technically sufficient. Thus, the Court\nof Customs and Patent Appeals 22 ruled:\nThe record in the case so far as the testimony on behalf of both par\nties is concerned is very informal and very unsatisfactory . . . deficiency\noccasioned by an inferior record.\nThe court was forced to reject as unproved the facts of the actual disclosure at\nthe 1917 Washington meetings (as testified to by Professor Cady in Pierce v.\nAmerican Communications Company, Inc). In the court's words, quoting the\nBoard of Appeals,\nWhether or not Langevin had the invention or had imparted knowl\nedge of it to Fabry or Abraham, the fact remains that no documen\ntary evidence has been produced showing what was disclosed at the\nWashington meeting.\n22110 F. 2d 687, 690.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nIt is extremely significant that the A T & T and Western Electric attorneys\ndid not use Dr. Frederick W. Kranz, formerly of their employ, as a witness in\nthis interference. Dr. Kranz's statement in Pierce v. American Communications\nCompany, Inc., is most revealing:\nIn 1918, Nicolson and I occupied adjoining desks. . . . I recall a con\nference at the laboratory about 1917 in the course of which Dr.\nCrandall informed us of the work of Professor Paul Langevin, of\nFrance, involving the use of piezoelectric crystals as sound transmit\nters and receivers. . . .\nHaving been successful in appropriating the inventions of Professors Cady\nand Langevin, why should not A T & T attempt to appropriate the commercially\npractical and most important crystal-controlled oscillator inventions of the late\nProfessor George Washington Pierce, former Rumford Professor of Physics and\nGordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics at Harvard? The Pierce oscillator\nis of two principal types (Figure 8): first, as shown in Fig. 2 of the patent,\nan appropriate two-electrode crystal 2 connected between the grid 26 and the\nanode or plate 30 of the electron tube 24; and, secondly (Fig. 11 of the patent),\nthe two electrode crystal 2 connected between the grid 28 and the filament or\ncathode 26.\nBut Nicolson's mammoth Rochelle salt crystal for responding to sound waves\nhas at least three electrical connections and one can trace some kind of connec\ntion to each of the tube electrodes. Why, therefore, should not Pierce's inven\ntion, too, be claimed by Western Electric on the basis of the Nicolson application\nand by A T & T on the basis of an application of an A T & T engineer, Bail\nery? So A T & T copied Pierce's claims and provoked interferences. This time,\nhowever, it came up against an applied scientist who was prepared to fight in\ndefense of his rights.\nThere were years of litigation which finally culminated in victory for Pierce\n23 . When it appeared that Bailey was beaten, Western Electric urged Nicolson\nas the prior inventor. Pierce's attorney took the position that A T & T and\nWestern Electric were really the same company, the former owning more than\n98 per cent of the stock of the latter. He set out to prove that they had the\nsame management control and were, in effect, the same entity. Therefore, since\nPierce had beaten Bailey (A T & T), he was not compelled to have another suit\nagainst Western Electric on the Nicolson application. The contention was that\nthe matter was res judicate - decided, once and for all. Not long after, an A T\n& T attorney, George E. Folk, visited Cambridge, thrust out his hand, and said\nto Professor Pierce, \"Call me George.\"\nWhen the basic Pierce oscillator patent issued, Professor Pierce carefully\nclaimed therein only what represented his advance over Cady and he would\ntake no claim broad enough to dominate Cady, though I am informed that as a\nresult of the settlement with A T & T he could have had any of the oscillator\nclaims that later issued in the Nicolson patent.\n23Interference 67, 863, Pierce v. Bailey v. Nicolson.\n\nCreate or Perish\nThe Western Electric Company Nicolson patent then issued, with Langevin's\nclaims and Cady's claims, and, for years A T & T used this patent as a club to\ncollect royalties on every crystal-controlled oscillator - collect, that is, except\nfrom those who knew the real meaning of the Nicolson patent.\nLet me give an illustration. Claim 1 of the Nicolson patent that was taken\nfrom Professor Langevin, reads: \"An oscillating circuit comprising a piezoelec\ntric device.\" This claim, in its true history, refers to Langevin's idea of having\nan oscillating circuit drive a crystal. It has nothing to do with a crystal control\nling the oscillations itself. And yet, in their licensing policy, the A T & T has\nread this, or tried to read this, on crystal-controlled oscillators. This is what is\nknown as \"verbal infringement.\" The words of the claim sound as if one were\ninfringing, but the meaning of the claim, as shown by the file history, is not the\nsame thing. There is, therefore, no infringement. I stress this point because\nvery often one cannot tell, merely by reading the claims of a patent, what they\nactually cover.\nIn rewriting history a few years ago, through the eyes of the Telephone Com\npany\n, an effort was made to try to evolve the Pierce oscillator from Nicolson's\nmaze of crystal-modulator connections. In Pierce v. American Communications\nCompany, Inc., however, Professor Edward L. Bowles discussed\nthe circuit diagrams of page 15 of the Heising text which are labeled\n\"Nicolson's oscillator circuit.\" In the interest of accuracy, I point\nout that the alleged Nicolson circuit and its variations shown on\npage 15 do not either accord or agree with the Nicolson circuit of\npatents 1,495,429, filed April 10, 1918; and the alleged divisional\npatent directed to Fig. 11, 2,212,845, filed April 23, 1923. This is\nclear from a mere cursory inspection.\nProfessor Bowles explained the details of this and, as stated by Judge Ford,\nshowed\nthat although Nicolson may have believed he had a crystal-controlled\noscillator, in fact he did not.\nJudge Ford found, moreover, that\nNicolson still shows the same whole Rochelle salt crystal of his earlier\npatent, with three electrodes arranged so as to operate as two pairs\nof electrodes. . . . The Pierce oscillator is so designed as to oscillate\nonly at the frequency determined by the crystal, the presence of\nwhich is necessary if the system is to oscillate at all. Nicolson, on\nthe other hand, while claiming that his system may oscillate at a\nfrequency determined by the natural frequency of the crystal and\nunder the control of the crystal, is also careful to point out that by\nproper use of reactances it may also be made to oscillate at some\n24See above, fn. 19.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nother frequency than that determined by the crystal. Clearly, this\ndoes not purport to be the same thing as the Pierce oscillator.\n. . . Defendant . . . argues that in 1918 Nicolson had already hit upon\nthe circuit which Pierce later patented. But these only show that\nin 1918 he was working on circuits which may superficially resemble\nthat of Pierce, as do those, for instance, of his earlier patent, which,\nhowever, discloses only a different function and mode of operation of\nthe crystal. . . . These pages furnish no warrant for a conclusion that\nNicolson in 1918 had anticipated what Pierce was later to discover.\nI should now like to recount, apropos of the plight of scientists when bringing\ninventions to our corporate manufacturers, the latest pronouncement relating\nto such activity, this time in connection with the International Telephone and\nTelegraphy Company. And the same Professor Pierce was involved. The deci\nsion is reported in Pierce v. International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation\n25 . Judge Hartshorne of the District Court for the District of New Jersey found\nthat\nFollowing Pierce's patent applications in the 1920's or early 1930's,\nPierce at I T & T's request, not only opened up his secret papers to\nI T & T for their examination anent the possibility of its taking out\na license thereunder, but he also permitted I T & T's representatives\nto visit his laboratory. In the complaint and at the trial the question\nwas raised as to whether Pierce's disclosures were confidential and\nwhether such confidence had been breached by I T & T.\nThe court went on to tell the kind of tactics that I T & T promoted:\nI T & T doubtless used every possible means to secrete its circuit\ndiagrams from Pierce, who had so freely showed I T & T all he knew\nabout his invention.\nAnd again:\nHere we must bear in mind that, as seen above, I T & T had acted\nin a peculiarly secretive manner, particularly with respect to the\nman who, in previous years, had given it every assistance, in the\nform of access to secret documents and in personal visitations and\nconferences at his laboratory.\n5.6\nConclusion\nThe dilemma facing the inventor who discloses inventions to outside organiza\ntions is thus pointed up by the typical (but rarely proved) specific experiences\njust recounted. The law, as presently applied, is inadequate; and something\nmust be done more properly to protect the rights of inventors.\n25147 F. Supp. 934.\n\nCreate or Perish\nIn the next chapter, I shall discuss some of the proposals before Congress for\nimproving the patent system and the enforcement of patents by the courts. If\nan effective program can be activated, our corporate giants may be more wary\nabout appropriating the inventions of others and wearing the inventors down by\ncostly and vexatious litigation.\nJudge Wyzanski, of the Massachusetts Federal District Court, in connection\nwith Professor Rudenberg's electron-microscope patent 26 , deplored the condi\ntion of \"the individual holder of patents\" who is\nat the mercy of large corporate enterprises which could use the in\nvention, decline to accept the inventor's reasonable offers, allow him\nto sue for infringement and in the end, if beaten in the infringement\nsuit, pay him not even a royalty high enough to cover the expenses\nof the litigation.\nTo similar effect are the words of Judge Hayes of the District Court for the\nMiddle District of North Carolina 27:\nThe result is not encouraging to an inventor. Indeed a patent, how\never valid and however flagrantly infringed, would be worthless in\nthe hands of a person with small means if it had to survive the ob\nstacles which have confronted the patent in suit. This is battle by\nthe defense to ignore the patents until a court of last resort compels\na course otherwise.\nSo the time has come for frank talk. If Congress, in these precarious times,\nis anxious to encourage inventors (and I have tried to show herein that many\nof the important advances have come and still do come from individual inven\ntors entirely outside established research laboratories and organizations), then\nCongress must make the inventor more secure at the hands of the potential\ninfringers and in the courts.\n26Rudenberg v. Clark, 81 F. Supp. 42, 45.\n27Davis Co. v. Baker-Cammack Hosiery Mills, Inc., 86 F. Supp. 180, 187.\n\nRights, Obligations, and Problems\nFig. 5.3: A part of Pierce's patent. (This image is public domain and is not\nprotected by copyright.)\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 6\nThe Future of American Patents\nRecent proposals for improving the patent system are discussed, in\ncluding conflicting philosophies in Congress and in the courts.\nA number of proposals have been made to Congress for consideration as\nbases for possible future legislation which may improve the patent system and its\noperation. They may also undo what the courts and other governmental agencies\nhave done to dishearten and discourage both inventors and persons with venture\ncapital, from taking a bolder approach in exploiting and developing new fields,\nunless under government direction or some other inherently restricting and ofter\nunimaginative sponsorship.\n6.1\nPrevious Suggested Improvements in the Patent System\nAmong the scientists who have been active in the field of patents is Vannevar\nBush, wartime director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development. Dr.\nBush, a number of other scientists, and lawyers haven the initiative in trying\nto recover and increase, in this country, fertile ground for invention and a more\nrapid progress in the development of the useful arts. To this end, an analysis\nand series of proposals has been provided in a study for the Subcommittee on\nPatents of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary .\nUnfortunately, as will later be evident, I do not agree that the underlying\nproblems can be solved by the principal proposals that have been advanced; but\nthe proponents are to be commended for their initiative, purpose, and sincere\neffort. As part of constructive criticism, moreover, substitute proposals will be\noffered, which I believe can effectively reverse the present unhealthy trend in the\noperation of the patent system. The role of the applied scientist and engineer\nin helping to reverse those trends will also be discussed.\n1Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Study 1, p.\n18.\n84th\nCongress, 2d Session (1958). It should also be noted that the Patent Office would still not be\nequipped to investigate prior use or sale, which are other bars to a \"valid\" patent grant.\n\nCreate or Perish\n6.2\nThe Search\nOne of the factors treated in Dr. Bush's study is the inherent lack of thorough\nness of the search in the Patent Office as to the possible novelty of invention, as\na result of (1) limitations in material to be searched and methods of searching,\n(2) the relatively small examining corps, (3) the limited budget for Patent Of\nfice operations, and (4) the limited time that can be given to each case by an\nexaminer. The thoroughness with which examiners search the prior-art patents\nand publications, and on the basis of which they decide whether or not to grant\na patent, is really not well controlled, though it represents an excellent compro\nmise in the light of the above mentioned limitations.\nDr. Bush and others feel that, if this search were improved to make it more\nthorough and exhaustive, the courts would perhaps give more weight to patents,\nand would not be so readily disposed to throw them out. These men propose\nlarger appropriations from Congress, increased classification and subclassifica\ntion in the Patent Office to insure that the examiner will not miss anything\npertinent, a much more complete examination of literature and of patents, both\ndomestic and foreign, and the installation of computers and other data-handling\nmachines further to assist the examiner. While there can be no objection to at\ntempting to improve the searching procedure and thereby make more nearly\ncertain that the patents that issue will be for really new concepts, I believe it\nis impossible to attain Dr. Bush's expressed hope \"to insure that the patents\nwhich it [the Patent Office] issues are in fact valid 2.\" This statement, made\nalso by some lawyers, appears to ignore the fact that \"validity\" is not arrived\nat by entering two and two into a machine, turning a crank to energize a logic-\nsequence operation, and obtaining an answer of four.\nThe law says that a patent is presumed to be valid. This is, however, no\ndifferent from the presumption in any other branch of the law. It means that,\nif an inventor comes into court as plaintiff after being granted a patent follow\ning reasonable investigation, the burden of offering evidence to overcome the\npresumption of validity is placed upon the defendant's shoulders. But the hope\nthat the search had been so thorough that a truly \"valid\" patent had resulted\nignores the fact that rarely does the prior art disclose the complete device for\nwhich the patent was granted. The \"validity\" of the patent grant more gener\nally rests upon the opinion of the court as to whether or not what was done\nrepresented an obvious extension of the prior art that the ordinary mechanic\nskilled in the art would have accomplished. The examiner had the opinion that\nthe advance was not obvious, or within the ordinary mechanic's ability to cre\nate. The court, in its opinion, either agrees or disagrees with this opinion of\nthe patent examiner. \"Validity,\" or the truly \"valid\" patent, is thus subject to\nthe opinion of the judge - and the opinion, even of judges as pictured by the\npublic, is a function of a human-machine temperament, education, background,\nexperience, intellect, and prejudice.\nAre we also to pretend that a theoretical system exists, according to which\nthe skill of the lawyers, the courtroom atmosphere, the demeanor of the wit\n2Ibid.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nnesses, and the nature of the parties are of no consequence in the ultimate result\nof the truly \"valid\" patent? And if, as stated in earlier chapters, the United\nStates Supreme Court is going to call upon the suggestions of Cellini in the six\nteenth century 3 to overthrow a patent in the mid-twentieth century - a patent\nrepresenting an invention that had solved a long-time problem and the solution\nof which no one could see in Cellini except certain Supreme Court judges whom\nJustice Jackson characterized as having a \"passion\" to strike down patents - we\nmight just as well abandon the hope that a more thorough search will result in\nthe truly \"valid\" patent.\nAnother illustration is found in a case\nwhere the judge had before him\nthe very same prior patents that the examiner himself had considered in the\nPatent Office, and on the basis of which the latter had ruled that invention was\npresent. The search, thus, was perfect. The defendant was not able to find prior\nart any better than that which the examiner had fully considered. The judge\nadmitted that the best prior art had been \"cited by the Patent Office Examiner\nand his allowance of the claims of the Kline patent was a finding on his part\nthat the patents do not disclose a tensioning spring with means of adjustment.\"\nThe court continued: \"With this I do not concur.\" And then the judge went\non to say that all the inventor had done was to employ \"familiar applications\nof mechanical skill respecting adjustability.\" The court, therefore, on the same\nrecord as that before the technical patent examiner, reached the conclusion that\nthe advance made was due to mere \"mechanical skill,\" an adjustment that any\nmechanic could have made, and hence lacked the unobviousness for which a\npatent should be granted.\nSo long, therefore, as the real test of invention is a matter of the opinion\nas to whether or not what has been done represents a real advance, how can\nthis affect the matter of perfect searching? The court can always disagree with\nthe Patent Office opinion, particularly if the court is imbued with the before-\nmentioned \"passion.\" Hence I am convinced that, while more thorough and\neasier searching is a desirable end, Dr. Bush's hope that this will result in truly\nvalid patents is vain. The late Supreme Court Justice Jackson, as previously\nnoted, has frankly admitted that \"the only patent that is valid is one which this\nCourt has not been able to get its hands on.\"\nSuffice it for present purposes, therefore, to state that if one can now be\nthwarted in court by the writings of Cellini in the sixteenth century, it will\nrequire not only the detailed cataloging of the mere 11,000,000 documents\npresently accumulated in the Patent Office, but almost every piece of litera\nture ever recorded - including the fantastic predictions of science fiction .\n6.3\nOpposition Proceedings\nThe next proposal made in this Bush study is to set up in this country a system\nof opposition. When the Patent office intends to grant a patent, it must publish\n3In the Jungerson case. See above, p. 65.\n4Kline v. Creative Textiles Inc., 146 F. Supp. 65.\n5236 F. 2d 713 (1958).\n\nCreate or Perish\nthat intention and thereby permit any interested person to oppose the grant by\npresenting evidence to the examiner in the Patent Office which may dissuade\nhim from issuing the patent. In this way, it is hoped, the court will feel that the\npublic has had an opportunity to call the attention of the Patent Office to the\nvery best prior art in existence so that, if the Office should grant the patent, the\npresumption of validity would be strengthened. This proposal, however, is also\nreally based upon the hypothesis that the inadequacy of the search is at least one\nprincipal reason why the courts have thrown out patents. I shall now endeavor\nto show that there is no validity to this hypothesis, and that instituting such an\nopposition proceeding would only delay the issuance of patents and complicate\nfurther the procedure and expense of trying to obtain a patent in the many\nthousands of cases where there will be no litigation.\nOf sixty decisions of the various Courts of Appeals prior to 1963, in which\npatents were invalidated upon the ground that they did not disclose a sufficiently\nimportant advance over what had been done before to warrant such a grant, the\ncourt specifically indicated in eight cases that it was invalidating the patent on\nthe basis of new art that the Patent Office had overlooked. In my study of some\nof those cases, moreover, based on my education and experience as a physicist\nand a lawyer, I came to the considered view that the so-called \"overlooked\"\npatents were actually no more pertinent than the ones actually considered by\nthe examiner. As a matter of fact, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\nremarked that\nit is as reasonable to conclude that a prior art patent not cited was\nconsidered and cast aside because not pertinent, as to conclude that\nit was inadvertently overlooked .\nThe patent examiner cannot possibly cite all the patents that bear on a given\ninvention. He picks out what he considers the closest to an anticipation of the\napplicant's concept, and places on the applicant the burden of demonstrating\nthat he has exercised invention.\nIn seven of the Court of Appeals decisions mentioned above, moreover, the\ncourts were perfectly satisfied that the Patent Office had made a thorough\nsearch, and so did not rely on any additional prior art to that cited and con\nsidered by the examiner. They just had an opinion different from that of the\nPatent Office as to the matter of invention.\nFor the remaining cases of this group of decisions, there is nothing to indi\ncated an inadequate search.\nIt does not appear, therefore, that the courts are primarily rejecting patents\nbecause of inadequate search. How, indeed, can a more exhaustive search solve\nthe problem of disagreement between a court and the examiner as to whether a\ngiven step represents the work of a mere mechanic or of a creative inventor? If\nthe reason for opposition proceedings rests upon the supposition that the court\nmust be convinced that a thorough search has been made, it seems that the\nunderlying hypothesis has been proved fallacious.\n6Helm v. Lake Shore, 107 U.S.P.Q. 313.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nWhile all patents represent potential litigation, and should therefore be care\nfully prosecuted by attorneys and closely scrutinized by the Patent Office, the\nDistrict Courts throughout the land actually adjudicated only about 0.3 per\ncent of all patents during the period from 1948 to 1963. Opposition proceedings\nin every case would have resulted in holding up the issuance of 99.7 per cent of\nthe patents for the supposed benefit of three tenths of a per cent. Still, even\nthis might be worthwhile if the courts could thereby be persuaded to dispense\njustice fairly and so to contribute to a constructive and healthy growth in the\nlaw of patents.\nWe can obtain a clue, however, from what happens in foreign countries that\nactually do employ opposition proceedings. In Great Britain, there is no rigid\nexamination, such as we have here. After an application is accepted, however,\nit is published for opposition. The grounds for opposition are the same as those\nfor invalidating a patent in an infringement suit, namely anticipation by prior\ninventors and prior use or disclosure in Great Britain. In 1958, for example,\n18,531 patents were sealed, but only 382 oppositions were filed. In Great Britain,\nfurthermore, there is also a delayed opposition. Any time within twelve months\nof the issuance of a patent, revocation proceedings may be instituted, but in\n1958, there were only 81 such proceedings. So the total of oppositions in Great\nBritain that year was actually about 2.5 per cent.\nIf this country could operate with but 2.5 per cent of oppositions, these pro\nposals might warrant some consideration. But it should be pointed out that, in\nthe period from 1950 to 1960, without any real search or any statutory presump\ntion of validity inuring to the patent, such as supposedly exists in our law, the\nappellate courts in Great Britain sustained more than half of the patents before\nthem. This seems to reflect an attitude of property rights and of encouragement\nof new ideas, new products, and new industries, different from ours.\nIn Holland, a country that has a rigid patent-examination system, 10,593\napplications were published from 1951 through 1954, 803 of which were opposed,\nor about 7.6 per cent. Again, this is a relatively small proportion. As a result\nof those oppositions, however, the Dutch Patent Office reconsidered its decision\nto grant the patent in slightly more than half of the opposed cases; so mistakes\nwere apparently caught before the patent grant.\nIn Sweden, another country with a rigid examination system, 5,005 patents\nwere published for opposition in 1954, of which 409 were opposed, approximated\n8 per cent.\nThe real test, however, comes in calling attention to the one country closest\nto the United States in aggressive industrialization, namely West Germany. The\nsituation there provides a real indication of what might happen if oppositions\nwere instituted in the United States. The German search is rigid, just as ours is;\nbut it has not been my experience that the search made by patent examiners in\nGermany, even as a result of opposition proceedings, is any more thorough than\nthat in the better examining divisions or groups of the United States Patent\nOffice.\nAfter a German patent is published by the Patent Office for opposition,\ninterested outsiders may file opposition briefs and sometimes appear at oral\n\nCreate or Perish\nhearings, to try to persuade the Office that the patent should not be granted.\nIn 1954, 16,743 applications were published, and 5,710 were opposed - 34 per\ncent of the total number of published applications.\nOppositions in more than a third of the cases in the United States would\nplay havoc in the overburdened Patent Office, and would make the way of the\nsmall inventor and the small company even more unbearable. Large companies\nand even smaller organizations would undoubtedly oppose almost all patents in\ntheir fields as a matter of course, and we would probably have something like 80\nper cent or more of all patents opposed, in contract to West Germany's slightly\nmore than a third.\nAnd to what advantage - particularly where it is doubtful whether the sup\nposed inadequacy of the search is what fundamentally influences the court to\nthrow out patents? Again we query: Would opposition proceedings have helped\nin the Jungerson case where the Supreme Court reached back to the suggestions\nof Cellini in the sixteenth century to throw out a patent in the twentieth?\n6.4\nTechnically Trained Tribunals\nWe come now to a third proposition, namely, that there should be a special\nscientific or technical tribunal that would find scientific and technical facts for\nthe judge. Dr. Bush says, \"It is unreasonable to require judges, skilled in the law\nbut not in science, to judge the merits of highly technical or scientific matters\n7.\"\nSimilar remarks, however, apply to litigation in other fields, economics,\nadmiralty, medicine, and other specialized areas in which the lay judge generally\nis not trained. The question really resolves itself as follows: Has the invalidating\nof patents been shown to reside in a wrong understanding of the science or the\ntechnical points involved?\nRarely does one hear the complaint that a judge who has conscientiously\ndone his \"homework\" did not understand adequately the scientific issues in\nvolved. These are always reduced to common, simple terms that an intelligent\nlay judge can understand. Technical experts on each side explain the few crucial\npoints in everyday language, with analogies to matters understood by the court.\nThere is room for complaint, however, where the judge abdicates and makes\nno real effort to do a conscientious job. Most patent lawyers appear to agree\nthat they much prefer the judicial temperament of a judge who hears all kinds\nof cases, and can himself weigh the issues in a patent case - provided that he is\nfree of the \"passion\" to which Justice Jackson referred. Reliance upon factual\ndeterminations by a technical advisor is dangerous, particularly in view of the\nfact that, once a technically trained individual knows the solution of a problem,\nthat solution often has become obvious. By virtue of his very training, a man\nwith only technical training is not usually equipped to determine whether an\nadvance was or was not something a skilled mechanic could have done. It is the\njudge who is trained to weigh and deal with obscure standards which define the\n7Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Study 8, 86th Congress,\n2d Session (1961), cites numerous instances where court-appointed experts have been used to\nexplain details.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\n\"mechanic skilled in the art\" in patent cases and \"reasonable or prudent man\"\nin negligence cases.\nThe British patent bar has succeeded in relatively recent times in having a\njudge with some engineering background appointed to hear only patent cases.\nSoon this judge, thus restricted in his judicial duties, fell into the rut of making\nsuch decisions as one might expect from a technician and not legally tempered\ndecisions which reflected judicial perspicacity and temperament. Within a very\nshort time, the House of Lords had to reverse this judge in seven of his patent\ndecisions. One of our British associates appraised the judge as having become\n\"lost in technical aspects without judicial consideration.\"\nAnother illustration of the dangers of a strictly technician attitude and the\nsafeguard of impartial judicial consideration is afforded by a comparison of the\ndecisions, involving the same invention, of the appeal department of the Dutch\nPatent Office (heavily controlled by its chairman, the commissioner of patents)\nand the District Court for the District of Columbia, in General Radio Co. v.\nWatson 8 . The invention in issue related to a discovery that, in certain kinds of\nautotransformers operating in industrial uses with carbon brushes that tap off\ndifferent voltages from different portions of the copper winding thereof, burn-out\nfailures were initiated by a destructive type of high-temperature copper oxide\nemanating from the winding itself, and not from overheating of the carbon brush\nand its assembly, as had been believed for years by those skilled in this art.\nA solution was found in preventing the development of the high-temperature\ncopper oxide by an appropriate coating.\nThe examiners of both the Dutch and United States Patent Offices cited\nprecisely the same prior art dealing with coatings for different purposes on dif\nferent types of electrical devices, and finally rejected the respective applications.\nThe technical Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office upheld its\nexaminer's final rejection.\nIn Holland, however, the before-mentioned commissioner's appeal depart\nment - from which no further appeal or review may be taken - overruled the\nexaminer as to the pertinence of the prior art and found that the inventor was\nactually the first to have made the discovery, despite the fact that engineers\nall over the world had sought for many years to solve the problem. Whether\nmotivated by a desire to protect Dutch industry, as I firmly believe from my not\ninconsiderable experience, or by some other conviction, the technician-controlled\nappeal department certainly evolved a new doctrine of unpatentability. It ruled\nthat even though no one had solved the problem before, and since the failure\ncould only have come either from the carbon brush side or the winding side, it\nshould have occurred to engineers that if it wasn't the carbon brush that was at\nfault, it must be the winding:\nThe Appeal Department is of the opinion that, since in the present\ncase there was only a choice between two possibilities, no invention\ncan be appreciated in finding the true cause of the burning-out of\n8188 F. Supp. 879 (1960).\n\nCreate or Perish\nthe known transformers (namely the cupric oxide formation on the\ncopper turns), even when on reasonable grounds the abnormal be\nhavior of the carbon brush would at first sight be suspected as the\ncause.\nThis confusion of hindsight with foresight, once the solution of a problem has\nbeen made clear, has been observed in many able technically trained men with\nwhom I have worked.\nThe ability to put matters in proper perspective and to weigh the likelihood\nof events without becoming entangled in details - in short, to see the forest and\nnot the trees - is particularly a forte of the well-trained legal mind. Thus, in\noverruling the United States Patent Office, Judge Morris of the District Court\nfor the District of Columbia held:\nThere can be no question but that the method discovered by Mr.\nSmiley, employed by plaintiff, and described in the application con\nstitutes a marked improvement over the original patented device,\nespecially when employed in industrial plants, and that it has com\npletely overcome the failure difficulties inherent in the original device\nfor such use. . . . Indeed the Board did not deny the commercial ac\nceptance and the obvious success of the method discovered by Mr.\nSmiley, and affirmed that \"the problem of transformer failure under\ncertain adverse conditions or operation was an elusive matter for\nsome period of time,\" and that the \"problem of transformer failure\nwas not found until an extensive research program was conducted.\"\nThe rare interdisciplinary man, however, who combines judicial tempera\nment with a scientific background can not only preserve rights in the matter\neffected by Judge Morris, but can do so with a conviction as to the technical\nsoundness of his findings that most lay judges do not have. Couple this with\ncreative ability, and the law of patents as well as that affecting other phases\nof science and technology will blossom as we grow up out of our mid-twentieth\ncentury infancy.\nIt is incumbent upon society - including our engineering and scientific com\nmunity - to persuade the few talented interdisciplinary men of the present gen\neration to give their country the benefit of this kind of leadership. The nation\nmust not continue to struggle with well-meaning and able political and judicial\npersonnel, who, though educated by early twentieth-century standards in the\narts, law, and the social sciences, lack an interdisciplinary training and the real\nexperience in technology and science that is essential for intelligent, confident,\nand progressive decision making in this era. Many decisions of government to\nday turn upon scientific and technological considerations far beyond the genuine\nunderstanding of those called upon to make the decisions.\nIt is frightening when a judge, or a cabinet member, or a president, must\nrely upon technical advisors, not just for details or analyses of problems and\nopinions as to courses of action (which appears proper and essential), but also\nfor very fundamental and underlying scientific and technical bases of decisions.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nWho, then, really makes the decision? We desperately need the experienced\ninterdisciplinary and creative man in government, and we must strive to educate\nsuch rare individuals if we expect to manifest the leadership and growth essential\nto develop America's future greatness in this age of science. Otherwise we shall\nmerely maintain custodianship of America's prior standard of accomplishment\nby \"politicians as usual.\"\nLet us turn now from the general to the specific. If judges selected from\namong the most able practicing lawyers who have stemmed from, and have in\nterdisciplinarily employed, a substantial scientific background and experience,\nand who have demonstrated record of creative talent, were appointed, this would\nbreathe new life into the law of patents and other facets of our rapidly merging\nsocial-scientific way of life. Since such appointment is purely political (the pres\nident having power to select all federal judges at all echelons), pressure by the\nengineering and scientific community can conceivably have its effect. Rather\nthan provide for the virtual abdication of decision by the judiciary (or, more\ngenerally, by governmental officers) to a technical tribunal or board of advisors,\ntherefore, I propose the upgrading of the political and appointive officers by in\ncluding some really talented interdisciplinary men who are now, almost without\nexception, engaged in private pursuits.\n6.5\nAre Today's Patents Worth Saving?\nIn the course of his testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Patents,\nTrademarks, and Copyrights (October 10 - 12, 1955) the late Judge Learned\nHand was interrogated by the late Senator O'Mahoney as follows :\nIs it in your opinion a good and useful thing, I am substituting\n\"good and new\" now, for Congress to exercise the power that the\nConstitution gave to it to provide by law for the exclusive use of the\ninventions or discoveries of inventors? Is it a good and useful thing,\ndoes it promote the arts and sciences?\nJudge Hand replied:\nThat is just the question. Nobody knows and nobody can know until\nthey examine how the system which has been working after all for\n150 years works in our present very complicated industrial society.\n. . . Each side is beating the air. On one hand you have a lot of people\nthat say the country would fall down without the patent system and\non the other hand you have people like Thurman Arnold, former\njudge in the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, who say\nthe patent system has outlived its usefulness, it is no good any more,\nit's now a tool for misuse on the part of the big corporations.\nThen, giving his own views as a result of his many years on the bench, Judge\nHand continued:\n9Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Study 1.\n\nCreate or Perish\nThe place for stimulus, I think, is those people who are very com\npetent and would be induced by that hope of a pecuniary reward to\ndevote themselves as entirely as is necessary.\nAnd when he was specifically asked:\nIn all of your experience on the bench on patent cases, have you\nreceived no glimmering or notion as to whether or not the patent\nlaw has served a useful purpose?\nJudge Hand replied:\nI have an opinion. . . . I think it has a great one.\nAt the end of his report, there are statements by officials of some of our\nmore promising small companies and by individual inventors on what the patent\nsystem has mean to them. For example, counsel for Polaroid says\n:\nThe company obviously places great reliance upon its patents. Its\nbusiness is very largely dependent upon its patent structure and it\nhas from the outset followed a vigorous patent policy of obtaining\nprotection on all of its commercial products and in addition on such\ndevelopments of its research group as may possess potential com\nmercial value. . . . We think there is no question but that Dr. Land's\nsuccess in commercializing and developing his inventions in light po\nlarizing materials was to a large extent due to the patents obtained\non those inventions.\nPursuing further the question whether the patent system is worth saving, let\nus refer to Study 3 before this same Congressional committee and a subsequent\nstaff \"Analysis of Patent Litigation Status 11.\" In the period from 1949 through\n1960, 58.5 per cent of all issued patents were assigned to corporations. (There\nwas no way of ascertaining how many of these assigned patents had originally\nbeen the fruits of independent inventors who later assigned their applications.)\nForty per cent were issued to individuals and were unassigned to corporations.\nThe remainder of patentees included foreigners, the United States Government,\nand others. Of this 58.5 per cent, however, only a little more than one-third\nrepresents the large corporations of the United States. A total of 73 per cent\nof all patents granted from 1939 through 1960, accordingly, were granted to\nindividuals (private inventors or backers) who held their own patents, or to the\nsmall corporations.\nThe little fellow is, of course, the one who requires the most protection\n- and he is the one who is stimulated by the assurance of protection to risk\nall, and thereby to advance the progress of the useful arts. The little fellow,\n10Ibid., 266.\n11Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights, Study 3, 86th Congress,\n2d Session (1961).\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nhowever, rarely if ever reaches the Supreme Court, because the Court, with its\nheavy burdens, has refused to grant certiorari in certain kinds of patent cases\n.\nIndeed, any case it does hear that in any way involves patents is heard as a result\nof most unusual circumstances, as where the government joins in requesting the\nCourt to take the case. Small corporations and individual inventors thus suffer\nbecause the lower courts feel compelled to follow in all instances the precedents\nlaid down when the Supreme Court exercises what Justice Jackson termed its\n\"passion\" to strike down the patents of the giant corporations.\nI have mentioned in previous chapters some of the many individuals whose\npractical breakthroughs, in many different fields, have given the technological\nadvances that we enjoy today, and who have led to the development and growth\nof many new companies that play important roles in our present economy. They\nwere small individuals when they started. Fortunately, the process is not dead.\nIn the very recent past, many of the basic developments of the Atomic Age,\nso called, were brought about by individuals, not by the larger companies and\nnot by government-sponsored research. This is the history of Einstein, Ruther\nford, Fermi, Dunning, Edgerton and others, working originally as individuals in\ncollege laboratories and the like.\nFormer Patent Commissioner Casper Ooms points out\n:\nMany of the names of large corporations of today are the familiar\nnames of the individuals who founded them; Westinghouse, Dupont,\nGoodyear, Singer, Ford, Edison, Bell, Wright - the list is endless.\nThe individual is not yet to be discarded. It is from his single mind\nand single-minded purpose that invention comes far more frequently\nthan most suspect or than the statutes revel.\nLook not alone to\nthe great contributions of the 19th century but look to our own\ngeneration or even this decade. There was De Forest with his tri\node, Armstrong with radio circuitry, Land with the Polaroid camera\nand so many others. The inventor working alone. Small business\ngrowing upon the advancing the individual's contributions, and all\nin fields in which large corporate enterprises with vast and proved\nresearch facilities were outdistanced by those single minds and the\nsmall businesses in which they worked. Yet in spite of these superior\nfacilities and the broader range of interests to which the research\nof these larger institutions is directed very frequently the \"break\nthrough,\" the startling innovation comes from small business and\nsmall laboratories. . . . Small business is a challenge for the bold and\nventuresome who ask only that they be permitted to continue the\nfight under the rule under which they have so successfully fought\nmediocrity, stagnation, and decline.\n12Since the passing of the 1952 Patent Act, the Supreme Court has declined to review every\ncase submitted to it in which the issue turned on the question of what is or is not invention\nunder this law.\n13\"Patents, Small Business, and the Age of Research,\" in Journal of the Patent Office\nSociety, Vol. 40, p. 5 (January, 1958).\n\nCreate or Perish\nTo the same effect is the report of Attorney George E. Frost before the\nSenate Judiciary Committee in Study 2\n:\nIt remains for the nonconformist, often an inexperienced outsider,\nto take the steps that lead to significant development. History is\nreplete with incidents of this kind.\nThe experienced designers of\nshoe manufacturing machinery considered and underestimated the\ncement process. The engineers of a smaller, less experienced concern\nrecognized the potentialities and made a success of the process. It\nwas the \"practical\" worker and \"tinkerer\" in a comparatively small\ncompany who devised the first successful adhesive cellophane tape\nand not the Dupont scientists who were working on the same prob\nlem. General Electric and Westinghouse - research-conscious orga\nnizations with large budgets - both misjudged the value of the wire\ntype photoflash lamp. The result was that a comparatively small\ncompany, Wabash Appliance Company, exploited this product.\nRecent studies at the University of Chicago by Professor John Jewkes show\nthat of sixty major inventions since 1900 (the era of substantial industrial and\ngovernment research activities), thirty-three - more than half - sprang from the\nwork of individual inventors! Included in these inventions were penicillin, the\nelectron microscope, the synthetic light polarizer, streptomycin, the domestic\ngas refrigerator, the helicopter, quick-freezing, the cyclotron, the ball-point pen,\nchromium plating, the self-winding wrist watch, and the slide fastener.\nAnd in many cases, as history shows over and over again, important inven\ntions are made by others than those who are experts in the field and by complete\noutsiders to the organized research organizations. Jewkes illustrates:\nThe jet engine was invented and for a time developed by men who\nwere not specialists in engine design. The gyro-compass was invented\nby a youth who was neither a scientist nor a sailor. Power steer\ning, basic radio inventions, cracking petroleum, magnetic recorders\n- these and other major developments occurred outside companies\nconcerned with their use 15 .\nThe facts thus show that we cannot rely upon government and large-company\nresearch alone if we are to maintain our technological and economic superiority\nin this day of serious challenge from the Soviet Union.\nIn reporting on a panel discussion before the American Institute of Electrical\nEngineers 16 , S. W. Herwald revealed that the Soviets\nhave copied many of the good parts of our private-enterprise system.\n. . . Incentive systems are used to encourage new ideas.\n14Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Study 2, p.\n18, 84th\nCongress, 2d Session (1957).\n15John Jewkes, The Sources of Invention, Macmillan, 1959, p. 50.\n16S.W. Herwald, \"Economics and Incentive Plans,\" report of panel discussion, American\nInstitute of Electrical Engineers, Feb. 1-6, 1959. Unpublished.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nPatents are one of our primary present-day incentive systems. Discourage in\nvention by individuals and \"outsiders,\" and you dry up one of our historical\nsources of important advances.\nA further article 17 reveals the following disturbing facts with regard to\nthe pace of invention in the United States. When it is remembered that all\ngovernment-sponsored research contracts require patent disclosures; that the\ngovernment itself employs at least five different and independent agency staffs of\npatent attorney working full time to file applications to protect the government\non patentable advances; and that private industry still scrupulously files for\npatents at least for defensive purposes so that it may make its own products\nwithout lawsuits; then it will be seen that the number of patents may be some\nkind of an index of the number of inventions made in this country. I have drawn\nthe following conclusions from the data presented in the article referred to:\n1. While research and development spending has risen tenfold from 1930\nto 1960, the number of patents issued each year has remained substantially the\nsame.\n2. There is a lower yield of invention in government research work and mixed\ngovernment-industry research work than in industrial-commercial work.\n3. In today's industrial research laboratory, each invention probably repre\nsents a minimum of about 7.5 man years of effort.\n4. The national average of effort underlying each patent issued to an Amer\nican corporation appears to be about 30 man-years.\n5. The United States, in the community of Western-bloc nations, is below\nSwitzerland, Sweden, Germany, Norway, Denmark, and Great Britain in per\ncapita inventions.\nCan we afford, in these perilous times, to do less than maximize the effectiveness\nof all our incentive systems, including patents?\nWhile the foregoing discussion, it is hoped, demonstrates that patents still\nserve a vitally important function today, particularly in the case of the individual\ninventor or small company, the question is frequently raised whether patents\ndo not stifle progress, particularly when in the hands of corporate enterprises.\nWhy this question should even arise today - when many corporate giants have\nabdicated to the wishes of our government antitrust lawyers, and have, in effect,\nthrown open their patents to avoid litigation - is hard to understand. As former\npatent commissioner Robert C. Watson, now chairman of the Advisory Council\nof the George Washington University Patent Foundation, has pointed out:\nAs a result of the RCA, IBM, and A T & T [consent] decrees, 22,500\npatents were dropped down the drain, so to speak thrown open, and\nI'm wondering when and where an evaluation of the economic effect\nof this disaster will ever be made 18 .\nIn answer to this question of patents allegedly stifling rather than promot\ning the progress of the useful arts, moreover, I might refer to a typical example.\n17Frank A. Howard, \"The Lagging Pace of U.S. Invention,\" Product Engineering, July 18,\n1960, p. 75.\n18Samuel W. Bryant, \"The Patent Mess,\" Fortune, Sept., 1962, pp. 111-112, 226, 231-232.\n\nCreate or Perish\nWhen the Radio Corporation developed its color-television tube, the so-called\nshadow-mask tube, CBS-Hytron was prodded, not discouraged, to develop im\nproved methods of making such tubes; General Electric Company developed the\nalternative post-accelerator type of color tube based upon a different principle;\nthe late Professor E. O. Lawrence developed the Chromotron, based on still\nanother principle; and the Philco Company developed the \"Apple Tube,\" based\non still another technique. Thus the issuance of patents, even to large corporate\nentities, does not stifle progress. On the contrary, it impels other corporations\nto find ways of getting around the patent, and in that sense admirably serves\nthe purposes of Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\nThe present utility of a patent-sparked competitive system as compared\nwith solely government-sponsored research and development is discussed also\nby Attorney Frost\n:\nExperience with government-sponsored research and manufacture -\nwhere the pressures of competition are normally absent - also brings\nout the value of competition in research. It was a group of \"out\nsiders\" who insisted that the gaseous diffusion process be pursued\nto separate isotopes in the atomic bomb development - and this\nprocess ultimately proved most successful. In the wartime synthetic\nrubber program, the RFC, thinking primarily in monetary terms,\nfirst authorized only the construction of butadiene plants based on\npetroleum as raw material. Yet it turned out that 80 percent of the\nbutadiene produced in 1943 came from the alcohol-base plant con\nstructed under pressure from Congress. The postwar experience in\nsynthetic rubber is even more revealing. . . . An analyst of research\nprogress in industry reports that all of the 6 major postwar tech\nnical developments, however, have come in large measure from 4\ncompanies that did not participate in the government program and\nconducted research in a competitive atmosphere. Similarly unsatis\nfactory experience has been reported in connection with government\ncontracted development in aircraft engines. The lesson of history is\nclear. . . . The patent system is a powerful force toward maintenance\nof a competitive atmosphere. Existing concerns are forced - upon\npain of payment of royalties or even foreclosure from a successful\ndevelopment - to explore all alternatives with an open mind. On\nthe positive side, the availability of patent protection encourages\nthe entrance into industry of new companies with fresh approaches\nunbiased by mental blocks that often result from experience.\nTo give another illustration: At the time the atomic energy program reached\nthe point, during World War II, where it critically needed certain specialized\nelectronic apparatus, it was merely necessary to adopt the inventions of a pro\nfessor who, in our free economy and under the encouragement of our patent\n19See above, fn. 13.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nlaws, had previously been stimulated to develop the art. What if, however, he\nhad not struck out on his own?\n6.6\nWhat is Wrong\nBut what faces the professor, other individual inventors and small businessmen\ntoday? They face the \"passion\" mentioned earlier and the apparent fact that the\nonly valid patent is the one that the Supreme Court cannot get its hands on. And\nthey face the likelihood that the lower courts will follow what Judge Learned\nHand stated were \"our orders\" from the Supreme Court. They face, also, the\nattitude of many large companies and the government, who are convinced that\nthey can appropriate inventions in the knowledge that the patents will probably\nbe thrown out in court and the claimant worn down.\nRecall the earlier-quoted condemnation of this practice by Judge Wyzanski.\nRecall, also, the situation of Professors Cady and Pierce and the American\nTelephone and Telegraph Company, with which I dealt previously. The scientific\ncommunity, moreover, mourns the suicide of Major Edwin Armstrong at a time\nwhen he was locked in a harassing battle with several large infringing corporate\nenterprises in connection with his frequency-modulation patents.\nEven before the complication of the present-day Supreme Court attitude,\nThomas A. Edison was quoted from the New York World of June 3, 1900:\nThere is no such thing in this country as an inventor's monopoly.\nThe moment he invents something that is an epochmaker in the\nworld of science and commerce, there will be pirates who spring up\non all sides and contest his rights to his ideas 20 .\nThirty years later, Edison remarked:\nCounting the expense of experimenting and fighting for my claims\nin Court, these patents have cost me more than they have returned\nme in royalties. . . . We have a miserable system in the United States\nfor protecting inventions from infringement. I have known of several\ninventors who were poor. Their ideas would have made them mil\nlionaires, but they were kept poor by the pirates who were allowed\nthrough our very faulty system of protection to usurp their rights.\n. . . I had to fight a long time in court over my claims . . . persisting\nin litigation sometimes for ten, twelve, or fourteen years\n.\nAnother roadblock in the path of the engineer and applied scientist and the\nsmall company trying to produce new inventions is the position of some members\nof the patent bar itself, who have taken full advantage of the hostility of the\ncourts by themselves challenging all patents as a matter of course. They should\nnot now be heard criticizing the courts when attempting to sustain patents,\nsince they taught the courts how to be hostile.\n20Remisen Crawford, \"Patents, Profits and Pirates - An Interview with Thomas A. Edison,\"\nSaturday Evening Post, September 27, 1930, p. 3.\n21Ibid.\n\nCreate or Perish\nThe practice of the United States Government itself in wearing down inven\ntors claiming compensation from the government for its use of their inventions\nis another discouraging feature. The Department of Justice has had a policy to\nthe effect that, when a royalty owed by the government to an outside inventor\nwas substantial, the inventor's claim was to be denied. The investor, in making\nclaim against the Army, the Navy, the AEC, the Air Force, moreover, is sub\njected to a different investigation by the patent departments of each branch, a\nprocess extending over many years and which, if the sums involved are large,\nusually results in sending the inventor into court with the government cards\nstacked against him.\nThere are numerous cases, furthermore, where small companies have sold\ntheir commercial instruments to the government and then found the latter freely\ndisseminating details of these proprietary items and letting them out for com\npetitive bids to anyone who comes along, regardless of patent or other rights\ninvolved. Then the originators had to seek their remedies (if any) in court\n.\nGovernment contracts, as before explained, include clauses to the effect that\nno matter how much work a person may have done in perfecting an inven\ntion before the contract, and despite the existence or prior patents or patent\napplications, unless he had, prior to the contract, sufficient resources to build\ncompletely and operate successfully the invention, the government obtains at\nleast a free license to the invention and, in atomic and space developments, it\neven obtains complete ownership thereof, with no obligations to the inventor.\nSenator Russell B. Long 23 believes the public interest is served by vesting in\nthe public complete title to any inventions resulting from government-sponsored\ncontracts. His belief stems apparently from the misconceptions that the profit\nfrom government contracts is in any measure related to or compensatory for the\ninvestment in background of the contractee 24 , or that the most able workers\nand companies will meekly sell their brain children for whatever the government\noffers, or that whoever is forced to take the government terms will be able to\ndo the job as the \"public interest\" deserves. Representative Emilio Q. Daddario\n25 , on the other hand, would settle for a compulsory royalty-free nonexclusive\nlicense to the government.\nThe late President Kennedy's recent directive 26\nstill appears to leave the government agencies to their own devices within cer\ntain prescribed ground rules, including prompt use of inventions by companies\n22See above, fn. 18.\n23Russell B.

They should be able to obtain flexible and fair terms of compensation\nfor the use of inventions arising under different types of circumstances, even\nif developed with the aid of government funds. Many a talented employee or\nconsultant refuses to consider salary alone or a pittance profit figure adequate\npayment for picking his brains, but insists on negotiating a return bearing more\nrealistic relation to the value of the work to the contractor. Should government\nbe deprived of the abilities of the most able minds, because Congress forbids\ngovernment negotiators flexibility in reaching the kind of terms that such talent\ngenerally insists upon?\nIf we are to accede to the presently popular philosophy that we should wel\ncome the paternalistic guidance of enlightened government, are we not entitled\nto expect Congress to trust its government contractors with freedom to nego\ntiate? If government officials cannot be so trusted, but must be fitted into the\n\"uniform policy\" currently advocated in high circles, then we cannot complain\nbecause the results are uniformly mediocre. Attorney Reed C. Lawlor of the\nCalifornia bar\npoints out that\nEmployees can negotiate special contracts with employers respecting\ntheir inventions. Why should government contractors be forbidden\nby law to negotiate special contracts with the government? . . . There\nare many individuals who refuse to work for industrial employers\nwho require them to assign all inventions made by them to their\nemployers. . . . These men who have refused to become employees\nof companies that would bind them with such contracts often form\ntheir own companies and create new industries and new businesses\nto the benefit of the entire public and of mankind. . . . The rights of\nthe individuals are destroyed where laws are enacted which destroy\nthe freedom of contractors to negotiate equitable contracts with the\ngovernment which would provide fair compensation for the use of\ninventions developed by the contractors.\nRecent Congressional hearings have, indeed, revealed a decided reluctance\non the part of very talented technical organizations and personnel to offer their\nideas to, or to work for, the government monopoly in space and atomic technol\nogy. Is the \"public interest\" served by depriving government of the talents of\nunusual people and organizations?\n27Senate Bill S1290, 1963, 88th Congress, 1st Session.\n28Reed C. Lawlor, \"The Public Interest: Government Patent Policy and Equity,\" 47 Amer\nican Bar Association Journal 972 (Oct. 1961).\n\nCreate or Perish\nAs a corollary, it is simple to predict the fate of the well-intentioned, but\npatently immature policy of \"not-for-profit\" contracts now offered by govern\nment. The strong professorial sponsorship of this policy reflects the dangers of\nextrapolating into the real world the well-meaning theories evolved in university\nand other ivory-tower experiences.\nIt is rather ironical that we should be grabbing all rights for the state in\nthe so-called \"public interest,\" at a time when even the Soviet Union has rec\nognized and adopted our tested, but now abandoned, capitalistic schemes for\nstimulating creativity through reward to the individual. The Soviets, apparently\nunimpressed by the government ownership and control programs that today are\nbeing proposed in America, make payments, over and beyond mere salary even\nto their own state-employed inventors, for government use of the inventions that\nthe state itself has financed!\nAdmiral Luis deFlores put it this way\n:\nThe patent system was created to reward and stimulate ingenuity\nand inventiveness. Classifying a novel idea as the inventor's property\nwhich could be reserved for exclusive use or sold or leased for a roy\nalty permits the idea to be used openly without fear of competition\nfor 17 years and with due recourse to law if infringed.\nThese rights and benefits have produced a powerful incentive for\npeople to exercise their ingenuity and devote their efforts to finding\nnew, improved ways to do things and new tools with which to do\nthem. There is no doubt that the existence of the patent and patent\nrights has had a profound influence on the rapid industrial growth\nof our country and served to bring native ingenuity to the force.\nIn recent years, however, there has been a tendency on the part of\nthe government to appropriate patent rights of individuals which will\nreduce and tend to kill the incentive they were originally designed\nto produce. History tells us that socialism, despite its well-meaning\nideals, just doesn't work in the competitive world in which man has\nevolved. Man's natural tendency is to try to outdo his fellow man.\nIf his efforts are not rewarded or are frustrated by rules, he will drift\naimlessly.\nWe also have a tax situation where, except for a previously discussed capital\ngains benefit given to a restricted class of patent holders, there is no opportunity\nfor the research organization or the individual investor to recoup from his suc\ncesses the costs of his unsuccessful experiments, thus insuring funds for further\nwork. The newly formed Academy of Applied Science is hard at work analyz\ning the real needs of inventors and commercial research institutions so that a\nsensible, planned tax incentive program can be suggested which will reward and\nstimulate the ultimate goal of successful innovation.\n29\"Ingenuity: A Quality of Victory,\" The Technology Review, Vol. 64, No. 8, pp. 35, 36\n(June, 1962).\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nWhere is the incentive today?\nOf course, a few of the more hardy will\nalways go ahead and take risks.\nBut is it any wonder that in the office of\nmany patent lawyers are new ideas for further development that are not being\nactively exploited? Or that the inventor today is wary of sinking money into\nthe inventor's wild idea? Where is return? Where is his protection?\nIt is surprising that most new entrepreneurs go to the government for spon\nsorship, and then get tied down to work only on those things which the gov\nernment employees dare to authorize. Rarely can they work on the radical and\nunusual things that have seemed \"impossible\" but that have given rise to the\ncreation of new industry in the past, and rarely with the all-important freedom\nto take advantage of serendipity, for exploring the unexpected discoveries of a\nproject often more important than the original goal?\nIs it any wonder that\nmany clients are not interested in adapting their own commercial advances to\ngovernment purposes 30?\nIt is ironical that the totalitarian menace to our way of life should be encour\naging research and invention when we are in the process of destroying the patent\nsystem and encouraging the piracy of proprietary rights. The part played by\nthe courts is believed to be the most significant agent in such encouragement,\nsince its checks and balances should have been used to correct the abuses by\nother branches of government that have gone hog wild. The real crux of the\nsituation is explained frankly by Justice Douglas:\nThe Justice comes to formulate his own views. The reexamination of\nprecedent in Constitutional law is a personal matter for each judge\nwho comes along 31 .\nIn keeping with this philosophy, apparently, such judges as a personal mat\nter, have determined that they do not agree with Article I, Section 8 of the\nConstitution, providing authority for the granting of patents. In a recent book,\nJohn P. Frank, former law clerk of Justice Black, frankly admits that \"Black has\npronouncedly unfavorable views on the patent system.\" In order to thwart this\n\"passion,\" the late Justice Stone, says Mr. Frank \"though he assigned Black\nmany good cases, . . . never assigned him one that had to do with patents 32.\"\nThe readiness of the present Supreme Court, moreover, to utilize \"particular\nconstitutional clauses to force states to conform to a social philosophy as policy\nespoused by a majority of the Supreme Court\" is well recognized\n.\nIn a recent address before the American Bar Association, Justice Arthur\nGoldberg seemed to reiterate the philosophy of Black and Douglas, apparently\nalso shared at least by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William Brennan,\n30\"State Business - Where are the Tinkerers?\" Time, September 21, 1962, p. 81. \"Instead\nof innovation in the area of consumer products, there is modification and trimming up . . . stiff\ngovernment laws may be stifling inventiveness. . . . \"\n31William O. Douglas, We the Judges, Doubleday, 1956.\n32John P. Frank, Marble Palace, Knapp, 1958, pp. 77-78.\n33J. R. Schmidhauser, The Supreme Court as Final Arbiter in Federal-State Relations,\nUniversity of North Carolina Press, 1958, p. 185.\n\nCreate or Perish\nJr., that the function of the Supreme Court is to act as the \"national school\nmaster\" who knows what social institutions are and are not good. Justice John\n34;\nMarshall Harlan, in rebuttal, cautioned however\nOne of the current notions that holds subtle capacity for serious\nmischief is a view of the judicial function that seems increasingly\ncoming into vogue. This is that all deficiencies in our society which\nhave failed of correction by other means should find a cure in the\ncourts . . . Some well-meaning people apparently believe that the ju\ndicial, rather than the political, process is more likely to breed better\nsolutions of pressing or thorny problems. This is a compliment to\nthe judiciary, but untrue democratic principle.\nA judicial decision which is founded simply on the impulse that\n\"something should be done,\" or which looks no further than to the\n\"justice\" or \"injustice\" of a particular case, is not likely to have\nlasting influence . . . Our scheme of ordered liberty is based, like the\ncommon law, on enlightened and uniformly applied legal principle,\nnot on ad hoc notions of what is right or wrong in a particular case.\nThe one feature that has heretofore distinguished our system of government\nfrom that of totalitarian states has been that we were a nation of laws and not\nof men; that our rights were determined by some measure of legal precedent\nand not by the personal views of the judges. Now we have the anomaly where\npeople not even responsible to the electorate are able to foist their own personal\nprecepts upon the land - despite the Constitution.\nProfessor Rodell of the Yale Law School says:\nGranted great government power to be wielded for the rest of their\nlives with no real responsibility save to their own prejudice-propelled\nconsciences, the judges sometimes begin to mistake their separate\nselves, however liberal or conservative they may be, for God, and\nSupreme Court Justices are men\n.\nAnd Professor Rodell points out case after case where the decision is based, not\non precedent, not on what the law is, not on what the Congress intends, but\non \"the judges' personal views on morals and ethics.\" The way in which the\n\"passion\" referred to by Justice Jackson can take hold is thus made clear.\n6.7\nThe Task\nSuppose, for a moment, that there were in the judiciary judges desiring to find\nreasons to sustain the property rights authorized under Article I, Section 8 of\nthe Constitution, wherever proper and feasible, much as the courts jealously\nprotect personal liberties under another Constitutional provision - the Fifth\n34Reported in Time, August 23, 1963, p. 17.\n35Fred Rodell, Nine Men, Random House, 1955.\n\nThe Future of American Patents\nAmendment.\nThe large corporations would then no longer dare to defy the\nindividual inventor so cavalierly. And venture capital would be encouraged to\nback new ideas, because of the assurance that the patent, when granted, would\nhave a real chance of being sustained. Our economic advantage would thereby\nbe stimulated, and without government subsidy.\nThe United States Government would no longer deny so readily the individ\nual inventor's claims nor violate so notoriously the proprietary rights of small\nbusiness. Outsiders would begin to think about government problems, knowing\nthat they would be rewarded for their work. The whole defense effort would\nbenefit, without all the thinking having to be sponsored by government funds.\nUnless reform from the judiciary itself takes place, however, it is difficult to\nsee how the court-sanctioned license to piracy can be checked, and the disastrous\nconsequences flowing therefrom. The recent history of the Patent Act of 1952,\nspecifically intended to curb certain Supreme Court techniques for destroying\npatents, shows that legislation, without a more positive and unmistakable char\nacter, cannot alone accomplish the desired end - and certainly not within a\nreasonably short period of time.\nThe Supreme Court, as previously stated,\nhas refused to hear case after case that would have led to a showdown on its\ninterpretation of the meaning of \"invention\" in the 1952 Act.\nTwo avenues to influence the courts may be open: first, the strongest kind\nof language from Congress with regard to protecting inventors' rights; and sec\nondly, new appointees to the bench who can win the respect of their colleagues\nbecause of their understanding of the inventive process and the requirements\nfor its nurture and encouragement.\nWe should not be content, moreover, merely to put the patent law back to\nwhere it was before the 1930's. We need constructive development by the courts\nto suit modern times, development that comes naturally in other branches of law\nwhich, unlike patents, have been moving forward. Contrast, for example, the\nSupreme Court disposition of patents upon the basis of Cellini's writing of an\ntiquity, in the Jungerson case, with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals\nfor the second circuit in 1892, on Edison's carbon-filament incandescent-lamp\npatent 36 , where, despite the fact that\nall-glass globes, with lead wires passing through the glass and sealed\nwith it, had been used before . . . and although the prior art . . . indicated\n. . . the use of burners of high resistance and small radiating surface,\nand although pencils of carbon had been tried in imperfect vacua ..,\ninvention was found in the successful use of a carbon filament in an exhausted\nglass container. Edison had made it work!\nNot only would Bell, Edison, and Westinghouse not be inventors in the eyes\nof the present-day Supreme Court, but Marconi was even stripped of the title of\ninventor, some forty years after the fact. As stated, in that case, by dissenting\nJustice Frankfurter\n,\n36Edison Electric Light Co. v. U.S. Electric Lighting Co., 52 F. 300, 307, 308.\n37Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. U.S., 320 U.S. 1 (1943).\n\nCreate or Perish\nbecause a judge . . . is able to demonstrate by a process of intricate\nrationalization that anyone could have drawn precisely the interfer\nences that Marconi drew and that Stone hinted at on paper, the\nCourt finds that Marconi's patent was invalid. . . .\nand this, despite the fact that\nnobody except Marconi did in fact draw the right inferences that\nwere embodied into a workable boon for mankind.\nAnd then, stating the real reason for the court's decision:\nJudges . . . should [be] . . . vigilant against importing their own no\ntions of the nature of the creative process into Congressional legis\nlation, whereby Congress \"to promote the Progress of Science and\nuseful Arts\" has secured \"for limited times to . . . Inventors the ex\nclusive Right to their Discoveries.\"\nSo, also, in the case of the Westinghouse airbrake (Patent 88,929 and Reissue\nPatent 5,504), invention was recognized, though the idea of operating railway\nbrakes by air pressure and many of the devices employed in such operating had\nbeen conceived earlier, but not successfully applied, by others. Similar com\nments apply to the invention of barbed wire by J. S. Glidden (Patent 157,124)\n38; to the invention of the alternating-current loading coil Nikola Tesla 39; and\nto many other inventions which have helped companies to start up so to build\nthe America we have heretofore known 40 .\nIt does not take an experienced engineer or scientist to interpret the graph of\nFigure 9, which shows the fate of patents in the United States Supreme Court\nsince 1925.\nAnd what will happen if nothing effective is done?\nIn view of\nthe attitude of the Supreme Court in the period 1950-1952, one had only a 28\nper cent chance of winning on both validity and infringement in the District\nCourt, an 18 per cent chance of reversal of an unfavorable lower-court decision\nin the Court of Appeals, and no chance at all in the United States Supreme\nCourt. Contrast this with the greater than 50 per cent chance in Great Britain,\na country without a rigid examination system and without legal presumptions\nof validity of a patent, but with a desire to foster its economy by encouraging\nthe creative spirit of the individual for the ultimate good of the nation.\nThere is still a Constitution-authorized patent system on our books which is\nintended to promote useful arts through giving exclusive limited-period rights\nto inventors.\nAs in other phases of our wonder-working capitalistic type of\neconomy, the rewarding of the creative individual inures to the benefit of a\n38143 U.S. 275.\n39Westinghouse Electric & Mfg.

The patent system, even though not always best\nsuited to our present needs, represents a primary source of material reward to\nthe creative engineer and scientist. To pass it by, or to refuse to become active\nin insisting upon its preservation, seems to me to be a serious mistake. It is up\nto the engineer and scientist to take an active interest in the patent system and\nto contribute the ideas vitally needed for its improvement, modernization, and,\nindeed, survival.\nThe difficulty is not with the concept of the system, but with an adminis\ntration and operation thereof not fully suited to current requirements or to the\ndirection of an unmistakable social trend apparently desired by most people.\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 7\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nThe possible effect upon our system of current planning for a com\nmon European patent is discussed in this chapter, with several of the\nauthor's views for modernizing and improving the American patent\nsystem and its administration.\nAt a time when most of the thinking at the United States Patent Office\nappears directed toward such matters as obtaining a new building, speeding up\nthe government's patent examination procedures, streamlining interference and\nother processes within the Office, and providing more incentive to skilled people\nto wish for Patent Office careers, our European friends are engaged in a far more\nbasic modernization program. More important than the details of the programs\nunder consideration in the United States and abroad is the spirit of enthusiasm\nand vigor of the European experiment. This spirit stems from a firm conviction\nthat the state benefits when individuals are encouraged and their proprietary\nrights are protected - concepts that, at least formerly, were an integral part\nof American pride and tradition. Serious revision of the basic concepts of a\npatent system to suit modern times cannot take place in the climate that we\nhave now created for ourselves; where, indeed, there are some who apparently\nare no longer sure that reward to the individual is consistent with the so-called\n\"public interest 1.\"\nLet us explore, briefly, the rather radical ideas in Western Europe with regard\nto the economic and social needs of a mid-twentieth-century patent system. In\ndoing this, we must bear in mind that the great postwar impetus is still at work\nin an awakened European Economic Community which filings aside the petty\nroadblocks of mere nationalism and refuses to retain long-established systems\nof a bygone era simply because they have been so long established.\n1A measure of this spirit seems now to have been kindled by S. Herbert Hollomon, Assistant\nSecretary of Commerce for Science and Technology, who has established a patent panel of the\nCommerce Technical Advisory Board to delve into these matters with a sense of urgency. Also,\nDr. Donald A. Schon, head of the Commerce Department, Office of Technical Services, and\nProfessor Charles Stark Draper, Chairman of the National Inventors Council, are instituting\nstudies.\n\nCreate or Perish\n7.1\nPresent Proposals for a Common European Patent and Judiciary\nIn an effort to meet the needs of a modern Europe, and despite the wide range\nof differences in national laws and requirements for the issuance of patents in\nBelgium, France, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg, and West Germany, these coun\ntries have banded together with the exciting purpose of trying to create a single\nEuropean patent. Appreciative of the limitations upon the courts of law in the\ngrowing maze of technology, but also cognizant of the necessity for the safe\nguards of the judicial process, these people propose a single European Patent\nOffice which will perform both administrative patent examining and judicial\nfunctions, complementing the processes of the national courts of law of the\nindividual countries.\nPreliminary plans 2 proposed by representatives of the respective govern\nments, and made more firm at the Berlin 1963 summer conference, are somewhat\nas follows:\nAn inventor may file for a single, common European patent either in the\nEuropean Patent Office directly or in any one of the national patent offices for\nforwarding to the European Patent Office. The international group of examiners\nstaffing this latter office, under financial support from all the member countries,\nfirst checks the formal sufficiency of the application papers and then forwards\nthe application to an International Patent Institute, probably at the Hague,\nwhere an international group of trained technical officers will make a novelty\nsearch and report on the closest prior art that can be found. No opinion will\nbe expressed, however, as to whether the claimed invention is or is not actually\na patentable invention in the light of this prior art. On the contrary, one of\nthe purposes of this novelty search is to enable the patent applicant himself\nto decide whether, in the light of the prior art, he actually has a patentable\ninvention and should maintain his application or whether his claims should be\nmodified to show more clearly how his inventive step is an advance over what\nhas been done before.\nThe European Patent office will then, as a matter of course, publish the\napplication as an initial grant, including the original or modified claims of the\napplicant together with the novelty search report of the International Patent\nInstitute. The public thus will know what the applicant is claiming and what\nprior art the international search has developed, and any interested member of\nthe public can make his own evaluation of such claim.\nThis published patent will automatically be treated as abandoned after five\nyears from publication unless either the applicant or a member of the public\nfiles a petition for a final examination and determination of the validity of the\npatent by the European Patent Office. Such a petition must be published so\nthat anyone interested in this patent-claim assertion may, within a limited time,\njoin in the petition and inform the European Patent Office of any prior art or\nother reasons for invalidity of which they are aware.\n2Committee of National Institutes of Patent Agents, \"European Convention for facilitating\nthe filing of applications for patents in respect of the same invention in several States and the\nexamination thereof,\" Unpublished draft, June 14, 1962.\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nThus, before making a final determination as to whether the initial scheme is\nor is not patentable, the European Patent Office examiners have before them not\nonly the results of the search of the International Patent Institute but also all\nthe prior-art references which the technical community of all the countries has\nbeen able to assemble. Prosecution of the claims will then place much as in the\nWest German, Dutch, or American systems, with rejections and amendments,\nand appeal to a special board of the European Patent Office for a final decision.\nOne reason for this two-stage procedure in the granting of the European\npatent is the fact that the average life span of patents in countries such as\nWestern Germany (voluntarily cut short by the failure to pay the successively\nincreasing renewal taxes) is about seven years. And the period elapsing between\nthe original filing of an application for a common European patent and the five-\nyear period for final examination is expected to approximate the same length\nof time.\nAt the end of that time, about half the patents will probably be\nabandoned, and the European Patent Office and the national courts will not\nbe cluttered with litigation over uneconomic or unimportant patents. A party\nbeing threatened by, or concerned with, an initial or preliminary patent grant,\nmoreover, does not have to wait for the patentee to descend upon him in order\nto obtain a binding determination of patent validity.\nUpon election to file for a common European patent, the applicant will\nbe barred from obtaining an individual national patent in any of the separate\ncountries. However, for the initial phases of this proposed program, the right\nto file for individual national patents is retained.\nIn the event that a suit for patent infringement is brought in any of the\nnational courts, after the publication of the initial patent by the European\nPatent Office but prior to final examination and final patent grant, the national\ncourts, with power to decide infringement only and not validity, must suspend\nproceedings to enable the European Patent Office to make its final examination\nand rule on validity. Should the European Patent Office decide that there is no\ninvention or that for some other reason the initial patent is invalid and no final\npatent of any kind can be granted, appeal may be made to a board of appeals\nof the European Patent Office, whose decision is final.\nEven after the final granting of a patent, and at any time during its life,\nthe public, and not merely an infringer, has the right to bring a suit before a\nspecial board of the European Patent Office for a declaration that the patent\nis invalid. And appeal to a European Patent Court staffed by internationally\nselected judges is available.\nOnce a final patent has been granted, however, the national courts may\nproceed with suits to determine whether the patent is infringed. If doubt as to\nvalidity is shown before such courts and if the validity board of the European\nPatent Office of the European Patent Court is also to consider the matter, the\nnational courts may, if they so desire, postpone infringement decisions until\nthe final decision on validity has been rendered by the European Patent Court.\nIn such infringement actions, the national courts may request the European\nPatent Office to act as an expert as to technical matters, including the scope\nof protection intended for a patent, or they may request the European Patent\n\nCreate or Perish\nCourt to interpret doubtful provisions of European patent law. The decision of\nthe courts as to infringement may be appealed to the national appellate courts,\nas in present-day fashion, but the final appeal will not be to the supreme courts\nof the individual countries but to the European Patent Court.\nInstead of waiting to be sued for infringement in a national court, moreover,\nany person who is concerned over whether or not he may be infringing a patent\nmay ask the before-mentioned special board of the European Patent Office to\ndeclare whether his product or process is an infringement. The resulting deter\nmination may be appealed to the same court, but a decision of the European\nPatent Court as to infringement is to be binding upon the national courts. Thus\nnational judicial sovereignty is being radically curtailed in an effort to establish\ncommon standards of validity and infringement and uniformity of law under the\nsupreme guidance of the European Patent Court.\nMore than this, litigation in the national courts and prosecution of eco\nnomically useless patents in the European Patent Office are to be minimized.\nSearches, examination, validity, and infringement proceedings are to be stream\nlined and standardized, as they must be if the present terrible waste of time,\neffort, and skilled manpower (involved in separate national patents, compet\ning patent offices, separate judicial procedures, and varying standards) is to be\neliminated.\nThese radical and far-reaching modernizing steps, in the race for survival\nwith an aggressive, enthusiastic, and hostile competitive society 3 , are being\nconsidered abroad at a time when, in the United States, there is more concern\nwith putting the law back to where it was forty years ago; with having a spank\ning new building for the Patent Office; and with speeding up the searching and\ncutting short negotiations between attorneys and the Patent Office. Indeed, we\nseem to consider ourselves clever enough to produce the \"valid\" final patent in\nshorter and shorter time, despite the increasing problems involved: obtaining\nand holding competent career examiners and the growing complexity of tech\nnology. This is how we have always done it, and apparently all that is needed\nto introduce time-study and efficiency \"experts\" and computers to speed up the\nprocess.\nA lesson for present-day American from its elders can be gleaned: namely\nto concern ourselves with substance, not form, and not to cling to procedures\nand format which have proved themselves long out-dated economically, socially,\nand politically 4 .\nThe economic and political effect upon the United States of real progress in\nthe competent administration and sympathetic protection of industrial property\nin Europe is another issue with which apparently few, if any, in government are\npresently concerned. If America is to be a world \"leader\" forging \"new frontiers\"\nin fact, and not merely in fine words, platitudes, and wishful thinking, it must\nshore up the sagging foundations of our free-enterprise capitalistic society before\n3Edward E. McGrath, \"How Should the U.S. React to Reds 'Man-in-Space Feat',\" Boston\nGlobe, April 13, 1961.\n4Report No. 148 of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 87th Congress, 2d Session\n(1962), p. 12: \"The very survival of the patent system, as it now exists, is at stake.\"\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nadding floors to the superstructure.\nWhat are the reasons behind our out-dated Patent Office procedures and\nthe general hostility or lack of interest and a sympathy for industrial property\nprotection from top to bottom of our judiciary? It is no accident that both Re\npublicans and Democratic judges are less than cordial to patents and complaints\nas to unfair competition predicted upon proprietary rights. It is no accident that\nvast groups of our industrial society have become less than enthusiastic about\npatents and about fighting to maintain their proprietary rights. It is no accident\nthat our engineering community is far from \"on fire\" and, like many other groups\nin our society, looks for security rather than for the excitement and adventure\nof its work with dreams of giant rewards.\nBy recent interviews of applied scientists and engineers in university, govern\nment, large corporation, and small company electronics laboratories in greater\nBoston, interviews conducted by my classes in invention, patent, and innovation\nat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and analyzed by the Academy of\nApplied Sciences, a shocking apathy was uncovered. Those working under gov\nernment sponsorship or employment felt no personal incentive from the patent\nsystem and, indeed, showed no concern for patents whatsoever since the latter\nwould be the property of the government. In many cases, they reported that\nthe lack of recognition of their personal efforts, coupled with the great difficulty\nin persuading superiors to try out something new or radically different, was\nresponsible for their attitude of doing a day's work for a day's pay.\nIn one major space laboratory, it was frankly conceded that if the germ\nof a really novel concept came to mind, it would be brought to completion in\nother commercial company endeavors outside the NASA program, because of\nthe grab-all patent policy of the government. This puts a premium on solving\nNASA's problems safely and regularly. Three patents applications, to be sure,\nhave been filed in the past four years out of the millions of dollars of space\nresearch conducted by this laboratory; but the commercial section of the same\ncompany has filed hundreds of such applications during the same period.\nMuch as the government patent policies have quashed creative ingenuity, so\nthe company employment agreements have reduced the interest of the engineers\nin inventing. Two principal reasons for this lack of incentive were advanced:\nfirst, the companies resist really new ideas; and second, the reward and recog\nnition procedures are actually not tied to creativity. Most of the commercial\ncompany engineers and applied scientists who were interviewed stated that they\npresently had some rather new ideas that they felt would be useful as products\nfor their companies. But they were not even suggesting them because of the\ndifficulty and even political danger in getting new ideas considered fairly and\naccepted. Possible inventions in fields outside their specific employment had\nalso occurred to many of those interviewed; but the universal explanations for\ndoing nothing about them were either that the company employment agree\nment made them the employer's property, or that the time, expense, and risks\ninvolved in our present patent system were formidable. Many felt, moreover,\nthat any recognition would go to others higher up on the company ladder. Are\nindustry and government managers awake to this lack of morale; or don't they\n\nCreate or Perish\nrealize its effect? The prevalent American management concept of equality of\ntalent and interchangeability of applied scientists and engineers saps at the roots\nof creative accomplishment. Flowers will not bloom without roots! 5 .\n7.2\nSome Different Ideas for Revision of the American Patent System\nLooking, then, at the foundation of our American patent system, I question\nwhether it is suited to hold up the social order of today and tomorrow. The\nsystem cannot but crumble if it rests upon fundamental concepts not in tune\nwith modern trends. It is of no use to long for \"the good old days,\" because most\nAmericans, rightly or wrongly, have unmistakably shown in modern elections\nthat they wish to adopt a different kind of social structure.\nSo, unless the\npurposes and effect of the patent system are matched to modern trends, the\ngood that resides, even in an out-dated patent system may disappear.\nWe should question, for example, whether it is sensible, in all instances, to\ngive to certain large corporations the same amount of power of exclusion in a\npatent that is given into smaller hands for the establishment of new businesses\nor growth. Is it not perhaps a terrible waste to have one branch of government\n(the Patent Office) grant a right after years of consideration and then to have\nanother branch (the Antitrust division of the Department of Justice) limit or\nabolish such right? Isn't this particularly true where the trend of Supreme Court\nthinking is directed, not toward real antitrust violations, but to the possession\nof instruments that, if improperly used, could conceivably result in violations\n6?\nWe should question whether, as the country proceeds unmistakably along\nthe path of more and more federal supervision, in accordance with the will of\nthe majority, the same social purpose is served by our present type of patents\nfor inventions in the highly sensitive field of public health as exists in other\nless sensitive fields of industrial products.\nThe must be examined because,\nthough the late Senator Estes Kefauver was unsuccessful in his attack upon\npharmaceutical patents in 1962, the handwriting is on the wall to be read .\nThe engineering, scientific, legal, and business communities of the nation\nshould now, before it is too late, explore policies that can preserve the impor\ntant stimuli of the patent system even under conditions where the public is\nhighly sensitive. We who are generally friendly to the patent system shall have\nperformed a disservice to future generations if we refuse to examine our present\nform of patent system to see if it is any longer as meaningful and proper in\nour present society as it was in the early part of this century. We shall have\nperformed a further disservice if we do not plan to integrate our patent system\nwith that of the European Economic Community.\nWith regard to the procedures, indeed, it seems that our emphasis ought\nto be making the path of the inventor easier in the Patent Office, rather than\n5Robert H. Rines, \"Current Problems in the Protection of Creative Ideas and Writings,\"\nIEEE International Convention Record, Part 10 (1963).\n6United States v. Dupont & Co., 366 U.S. 316 (1961).\n7Science, Vol. 134, pp. 89-90 (July 19, 1961).\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\napproaching the problem solely from the present point of view of making it easier\nand quicker for the government to speed up its consideration of patents. Neither\nthe Patent Office examiners nor any other group of individuals can do creative\nwork in an atmosphere of speed. In fact, the examiners should better be given\nmore time for thorough consideration of the matter of patentability and the\napplication of the judicial tests of obviousness and other standards of invention,\nif judges are to be asked to give great weight to the examiners' conclusions.\nSpeed is not, and never has been, a substitute for thorough work; and so we\nmust decide whether the issuing of good patents is more or less important than\nthe prompt issuing of large numbers of possibly inferior patents. This, again, is\nthe question: Is America interested in substance or in mere form?\nLet us consider, therefore, another approach predicated upon the hypothesis\nthat a patent examiner is not just a servant of the public at large, but under\nthe very constitutional provisions whereby the patent system exists also has\na responsibility to the individual inventor.\nHe should not engage merely in\nthe destructive process of rejection, but should speed the process of patent\nexamination through active assistance to inventors, in order that patents be\nissue promptly when invention appears to be present. It should be as important\nfor an examiner to feel content when assisting an inventor in obtaining a patent\nwith claims of proper scope as it is now for many examiners when sustained by\nthe Board of Appeals in a rejection.\nTo this end, a reformulation of present Patent Office practice can be made\nby administrative order of the commissioner which will take into account the\nlong-overlooked Patent Office responsibility to the inventor. Specifically, when\nan examiner is convinced that an invention is present but is dissatisfied with the\nclaims of the applicant, he should be required to suggest different claims or call\nfor an interview for the purpose of formulating such claims with the inventor\nor his counsel. This is the common practice of the West German Patent Office.\nAnd this is the healthy way to speed prosecution, a much better way than\narbitrarily limiting the applicant to two Patent Office actions, as now proposed\nin so-called \"compact\" patent prosecutions.\nCould we also move a step further in order to expedite prosecution and\neliminate the necessity for so many appeals before the Board of Appeals and\nthe courts? When the Patent Office is convinced that invention is present, but\nagreement as to the working of the claim cannot be reached with the inventor's\ncounsel, might not the Patent Office thereupon give the applicant his choice:\neither suffer a final rejection or accept a prompt patent containing a claim of\nthe scope that seems proper to the Patent Office; but including in the patent\ndocument claims not approved by the Office but which the applicant still feels\ndescribe the invention more fairly.\nThe whole purposed of claims is to alert the public as to the metes and\nbounds of the patent grant. No one, from reading a claim, however, understands\nwhat the claim covers or what if actually means without recourse by skilled\ncounsel to the file history of the patent.\nSince counsel must study this file\nhistory to interpret the claims anyway, it would seem that he could equally\nwell determine whether the claim granted by the Patent Office under this new\n\nCreate or Perish\nproposal was broad enough, or whether the inventor's claim represent more\nadequate allowable protection. The public can thus be alerted as to what the\ncourt will probably hold with regard to the ultimate scope of the patent, which\nseems to be the only reason for having claims in the first place.\nHealthy expedition of patent applications prosecution and the elimination of\nmuch appellate procedure would appear to be the dividends accruing from such\na system. This would be particularly true where the matter of presumption of\nvalidity (which would only attach to the Patent Office allowed claims) is purely\na procedural benefit as interpreted in practice by the modern courts.\nAnother suggestion I would offer for expediting patent application prosecu\ntion is also peculiarly within the province of the commissioner to accomplish,\nnamely to abolish some of the ritualistic and formalistic rules of claim drafts\nmanship. While at one time in our development of the law it was probably\nsound to adopt greater strictness in this regard, in order to introduce clarity\nand definiteness and to establish how claims should be construed, I question\nwhether this is still valid 8 .\nIn the 1952 Patent Act, Congress went part way in authorizing functional\nclaim language (\"means\" plus function), with a statutory provision that this is to\nbe interpreted to cover the kind of structure disclosed in the patent specification\nand equivalents. This was intended to curb court criticisms and to simplify claim\ndrafting, consistent with permitting proper scope of coverage.\nShould we not also remove, however, the time-consuming obstacles involved\nin trying to connect and agree with the Patent Office upon broad claim ter\nminology, simply because the rules forbid the use of alternative or illustrative\nexpressions, to wit; \"of metal or plastic or wood or the like,\" or \"such as elec\ntrical or mechanical or electro-mechanical members,\" etc?\nShouldn't we re\nexamine these expressions to see whether they actually introduce indefiniteness\nand vagueness, or whether, on the contrary, they do clarify what is intended?\nAn additional proposal relates to encouraging prompt disclosure of ideas\nwithout fear of litigation and appropriation. It is doubtful if any agency outside\nthe Patent Office receives so many new ideas. The Patent Office, moreover,\ngenerally receives these ideas years in advance of their publication either in\nperiodicals or in pieces of commercial equipment; and certainly the long delay\nin the issuance of patents prevents the rapid informing of the public as to the\ncontents of the applications. Is it in the public interest that our system, which\nrequires in this era acceleration in new-product and in new-idea development,\nshould be stymied by the secrecy with which these ideas must be held in the\nPatent Office until the inventor dares to risk disclosure?\nI have proposed\nthat the Patent Office or a related arm of the Commerce\nDepartment should assume the added function of lending its good offices for\nbringing together promptly inventor and interested potential licensee under a\npredetermined set of safeguards. The inventor must, of course, be free to refuse\n8Robert H. Rines, \"Recent Attitudes - Judicial, Executive, and Legislative - Foreshadowing\nthe Demise of the Present Form of American Patent System,\" Bulleting of the Canadian\nPatent Institute, January, 1962.\n9Ibid.\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nthis proposal if he so desires, and to proceed as he does now. If, however, he\nwishes the benefit of this proposal, he would agree (1) that the details of his\ninvention may be brought to the attention of possible licensees subscribing to a\nPatent Office service and (2) that, should the potential licensee be interested,\nthe inventor agrees to terms as provided in a predetermined set of royalty or\nother payment standards related to the industry involved.\nThose who wish to be subscribers to or recipients of this confidential infor\nmation as potential licensees, on their part, will agree to keep the disclosures in\nconfidence and, if they decide to adopt the ideas and if the Patent Office grants\na patent covering the same, to respect the patent and to enter into arrangement\nunder the provisions of the predetermined set of standards. The potential li\ncensees subscribing to this service would have the right to call to the attention\nof the Patent Office any prior art or prior use of which they are aware so that\nthe examiner would not inadvertently issue a patent where it should not be\ngranted. This procedure protects the potential licensee and should not hold up\nthe prosecution of the patent applications. The potential licensee would still\nhave rights to contest infringement, or to contest inventorship on the basis of\nany application then pending, but this right should probably be restricted to\npending applications in order to protect the inventor from interference contestd\non matters that the license may have independently previously evolved but did\nnot consider important enough to act upon.\nThis would also encourage the\npotential licensee to file more punctually and thus disseminate more rapidly\ninformation beneficial for the progress of the useful arts. Toward the same end,\nmoreover, beneficial tax provisions might be provided, though this would not\nbe a necessary or required condition.\nUnder such a system, inventors would feel free to have subscribing potential\nlicensees examine their inventions and, by subsequent direct contact, further\nconfidential information not contained in the patent application, without fear\nof legal entanglements. This should also protect potential licensees from being\nheld up by inventors who demand an unreasonable price; and it also protects\nthe potential licensees with respect to their own independent developments and\nto the prevention of inadvertent issuance of patents.\nAll of this may be accomplished, moreover, by the utilization of the type of\nexaminer presently employed in the classification division. Such examiners are\nskilled in determining the field and nature of inventions, as they are filed, and\nare able to correlate the same with requests that will similarly be filed by the\nsubscribing potential licensees. It would appear to be in the decided interest\nof the United States Government itself to subscribe to this service. In such\nevent, indeed, a great many of the present-day complications and distrust of the\ngovernment by inventors could be eliminated.\nSince the rules of practice of the Patent Office, made pursuant to the statu\ntory authorization of the patent laws, have long recognized the right of the\nPatent Office to permit others to inspect applications, provided permission is\ngiven in writing by the applicant, no new legislation or other action on the part\nof Congress would seem to be required to institute this program. Rather, it\nwould appear to be peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the commissioner of\n\nCreate or Perish\npatents to set up such a liaison function. The Patent Office has already as\nsumed jurisdiction of a somewhat similar, though less comprehensive program,\nin connection with inviting attention to patents that are available for licensing.\nThis proposal, moreover, goes far beyond the concept of the National Inven\ntors Council and the products list circular of the Small Business Administration,\nand should stimulate inventors to complete their thinking on ideas that relate\nnot only to their own businesses or fields of endeavor, but to entirely diverse\nfields; all with assurance that such disclosure is worthwhile and does not involve\nthe likelihood of costly legal procedures and litigation.\nIf we are to enjoy the luxury of having many of our best engineers and\nscientific people work in fields and on devices that have no bearing on pressing\nproblems in military and other high-priority fields, we must find some incentive\n- the above system or something like it - which will impel these engineers\nand scientists to work on problems not immediately concerned with their daily\nduties. Certainly the important inventions that have been contributed in various\nfields by workers outside those fields demonstrate the value of such a result. This\nmay be part of the answer to the problem of maintaining our freedom to select\nwhat we wish to work on in our daily lives, while competing more effectively\nwith the Soviet society, where the very best brains are forced to work upon\nmilitary and other pressing state problems.\nLastly, we should explore more promptly whether the patent system can\never be adequate as virtually the only universal government reward for advance\nments in the useful arts. Scientists and engineers are stimulated to creativity, of\ncourse, by mechanisms other than the patent system, including an enthusiasm\nfor science or technology itself, the approbation of the scientific or engineering\ncommunity, the publication of papers, the winning of a Nobel prize, and the\nattainment of a higher position in an organization. Privately sponsored efforts\ntoward this goal of providing reward and recognition for various degrees of cre\native advances in applied science and engineering, as distinguished from those\nof pure science, are under way under the auspices of The Academy of Applied\nScience.\nFurthermore, we should select that situation dealing with the useful arts\nand applied science in which monetary, business, and prestige rewards can\nbe achieved through patents and modernize the patent system so that it will\neffectively satisfy present needs and provide the stimulation necessary to re-\nencourage creativity in the mid-twentieth century applied scientific and engi\nneering community 10 .\nMost important, however, we should decide promptly whether it is invention\nper se that we should stimulate primarily, or the executing of actual innovation\n- requiring development and entrepreneuring, as well 11 .\nIf it is the latter,\n10Note also the suggestions of Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, \"Science, Man, and Politics,\" Saturday\nReview of Literature, Oct. 20, 1962, p. 24, concerning the necessity for talented scientific\npeople to become actively interdisciplinary in this era where \"the dominant influence of science\nis perhaps the outstanding fact of today's world.\"\n11Not all \"innovation\" requires invention. Should we not seek to define \"innovation,\" if this\nis what we are after, and reward it?\n\nThe Modernization of Patent Systems\nas I strongly suspect, then perhaps a keying of tax-preference benefits to the\ninnovator over a period of years, rather than the creation of exclusive rights and\na belaboring of the patent system, will be a more effective stimulant which, as\nan ancillary benefit, would carry with it great simplification of our litigation\nproblems.\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 8\nCourt Modernization for Aiding the Patent\nSystem and the Law, in General\nSince there is a decided legal, as well as technical, side to the prob\nlems of patents and of protecting proprietary rights, a pin-pointing\nof difficulties in our current system of judiciary review is necessary\nin the interest of completeness. This is done here in language that\nthe nonlawyer also can understand. Included are some suggestions\nthat would have far-reaching effects for patent litigants as well as all\nthose having property rights.\nThe suggestions for improving the attitude of the courts toward the property\nrights of the creative individual, in order restore incentive to our present patent\nsystem, are arrived at perhaps piecemeal.\nIf the Supreme Court's hostility\nto or disinterest in patents is overcome, there may still remain other personal\nprejudices relating to other facets of the law.\nA more generalized proposal\nfor trying to remedy all these disturbing influences is thus in order, especially\nsince we recognize the fact that the complexion of the court cannot be changed\novernight.\n8.1\nThe Nature of the Criticism\nAltogether apart from partisan or ethnic dissatisfaction with decisions of the\nSupreme Court in particular cases (which will probably always persist but may\nperhaps be tempered by a better selection of justices from many legal fields and\nexperiences) there are serious, more deep-seated worries among legal profession\nals. They are naturally reluctant to criticize the august institution, not because\nof undue awe for the intellects or judicial perspicacity of the appointees to the\nhigh bench but, rather, because of the importance of the historically stabilizing\neffect of prior courts upon our way of life.\nInformed criticism of the conduct of the Supreme Court covers a wide range.\nSome critics feel, generally, that the number of cases crowding the court makes\nimpossible well-considered, well-written decisions, worthy of respect. Profes\nsor Henry M. Hart, Jr., of the Harvard Law School, has presented \"The Time\n\nCreate or Perish\nChart of the Justices 1\" showing the actual impossibility of reaching conscien\ntious, erudite decisions under present conditions, quite apart from fair play for\nlitigants. Under Professor Hart's assumptions, the justices, if in fact they do\nstudy all petitions and appeals, can give each of 1300-odd annual petitions for\nwrit of certiorari and appeals about ten minutes' consideration 2:\nOthers feel that they court pays little attention to, and indeed is disposed to\nignore, many, many fields vital to our way of life, including patents, copyrights,\nand property rights in general, in favor of multitudes of perhaps nationally\ntrivial, minor abuses of other kinds of rights 3 . Among the justices themselves,\nindeed, there appears to be great resentment over the conversion of the Supreme\nCourt into an appellate tort court:\nTo review individualized personal injury cases, in which the sole issue\nis sufficiency of the evidence, seems to me not only to disregard the\nCourt's proper function, but to deflect the Court's energies from the\nmass of important and difficult business properly here 4 .\nMany lawyers object strenuously to the philosophy that justices - appointed\nfor life - should foist upon an electorate their own personal views as to matters\nof social, economic, and legal conduct. Still others decry the lack or respect\namong certain justices for legal precedent, the legislative functions of Congress,\nand the historic duty of the Supreme Court to try, at least, to bring some mea\nsure of stability and order to our judicial and legal processes. In the Holmes\nLectures at Harvard in 1958, Judge Learned Hand frankly explained this dan\ngerous condition:\nI trust it is not disrespectful to say that I find it impossible to predict\nwhat attitude the Court would take towards a statute of which it\nmuch disapproved even where it concerned economic issues only; and\n... the answer becomes decidedly more obscure when the statute\ntouches those other interests, now called \"Personal Rights 5.\"\nHow correct was Mr.\nJustice Roberts' earlier prediction in Mahnich v.\nSouthern S.S. Co. 6:\nThe evil resulting from overruling earlier considered decisions must\nbe evident. In the present case, the court below naturally felt bound\n173 Harvard Law Review, pp. 84 - 125 (1959).\n2By the same computation formula, the ten minutes had been whittled down in 1960 and\n1961. 74 Harvard Law Review, pp. 99, 100 (1960) and 75 Harvard Law Review, pp. 85, 86\n(1961).\n3Robert H. Rines, \"Some Legal Considerations in Presenting Technical Information,\" In\nstitute of Radio Engineers Transactions, Vol. EWS-2, No. 3, pp. 84-88 (1959); Harry G.\nHehn, \"Current Developments in Copyright Law,\" American Bar Association Ninth Annual\nSymposium on Copyright, p. 10.\n4Mr.\nJustice Stewart, Sentilles v.\nInter-Carribean Shipping Corp., 361 U.S. 107, 111\n(1959).\n5\"Personal Rights\" refers to the Bill of Rights.\n6321 U.S. 96, 113 (1944).\n\nAiding the Patent System and the Law\nto follow and apply the law as clearly announced by this court. If\nlitigants and lower federal courts are not to do so, the law becomes\nnot a chart to govern conduct but a game of chance; instead of set\ntling rights and liabilities it unsettles them ... and ... the deplorable\nconsequence will inevitably be that the administration of justice will\nfall into disrepute. Respect for tribunals must fall when the bar and\nthe public come to understand that nothing that has been said in\nprior adjudication has force in a current controversy.\nAnd coupled with this is the apparent philosophy that the ends of justice\nare served by attaining the desired result of favoring or disfavoring a class of\nlitigant, even if this is done on the flimsiest of rationalization. In the words of\none of our ablest federal judges 7:\nIn my opinion there was no evidence whatsoever of negligence on the\npart of the engineer. I cannot read the record as a whole in a way\nto find any evidence of negligence. But I know that my method of\nreading the record is different from that of a majority of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States as exhibited in past cases, and I hope I\nam a lawful judge, and I recognize the limits of my authority, whether\nappellate judges do or not.\nThe host of relatively recent Congressional countermands of the effects of the\nSupreme Court decisions demonstrates, others point out, an unhealthy conflict.\nThe readiness of certain justices to overturn long-established and well-considered\nlaw and legal rules, to attain a given result, has been particularly frustrating to\nconscientious law-enforcement officers, also. Recent episodes of this character\nare illustrated by Rios v. United States and Elkins et al v. United States\n.\nUnder this procedure, we may expect newly fashioned reversals of law every\ntime that the court changes its members, or the members change their personal\nviews.\nAs another illustration: in reviewing the past two decades, without first\nlooking at the actual decisions of the Supreme Court, I found it possible to pre\ndict with almost 100 per cent accuracy, which justices would ultimately decide\nagainst the patentee. And this was true even in the absence of knowledge as to\nthe merits or issues of a patent case or a case in which a patentee was somehow\ninvolved.\nWhile recognizing the necessity for the justices to exercise discretion in mat\nters of certiorari, many lawyers protest the clear usurpation of Constitutional\npower by the court in declining to hear matters concerning which the Consti\ntution directs that the Supreme Court \"shall have the appellate Jurisdiction.\"\nIt declines by dismissing appeals for \"want of a substantial federal question.\"\nIf the work load is too onerous, some feel 9 , it behooves the court to protest\n7Judge Charles E.

Whether a case involving a construction of a State statute that authorized\ndeprivation of a right to trial by jury by an order for a new trial, issued pursuant\nto a secret hearing, held without notice, in a locked private room of the court\nhouse from which counsel was deliberately excluded by a judge, presents no\n\"substantial federal question 13.\"\n2. Whether a case involving a novel construction of the Patent Act of 1952\nthat permitted the destruction of a patent for a device that the Court of Ap\npeals14 had to admit was (1) \"useful and ingenious,\" (2) \"not known prior,\" (3)\nhad \"solved these problems\" of the prior art, and (4) had \"commercial success\"\n(in short, all the tests heretofore known to the law for demonstrating patentable\ninvention) was of import for decision; particularly where, under similar circum\nstances, other Courts of Appeals had interpreted the Act contrarily, and the\nparties before such Courts of Appeals joined with plaintiff in seeking a first\ninterpretation from the Supreme Court of the Act\n.\n3.

It appears\nthat this has had the support of some of the courts and some members of\nCongress 18 . But it has evoked serious objection by those who believe that it is\nvitally necessary for the federal courts to exercise such jurisdiction 19 . Though\na compromise in the raising of the jurisdictional sum from $3,000 to $10,000\nwas adopted, our troubles still persist.\nJustice Harlan has proposed increasing the number of law clerks. Certainly\nthis should be done in any event - but not to substitute the views of law clerks\nfor those of the justices as to whether or not a case should be heard, or as to the\ndecision to be rendered. Others have suggested that administrative assistants\nof commissioners be given to the court, or experienced lawyers be appointed\nto aid the justices in the pursuit of their tasks\n. These proposals, however,\nclearly cannot obviate the real difficulties before recounted, as pointed out by\nthe late Justice Jackson 21 .\nStill other suggestions for an enlarged court and for sitting in sections of\nchambers have been found wanting 22 .\n17McKenna v. Seaton, 259 F. 2d 780, certiorari denied, 358 U.S. 835 (1958). The gravity\nof the question involved was described by dissenting Judge Prettyman (p. 786). \"The basic\nproblem is the 'rule of law.' We have laws - either statutes or rules legally adopted - and we\nare supposed to be governed by them. If our governors merely do whatever strikes them as\njust and fair and reasonable at the moment, we have rule by men instead of by law. These\nare no cliches. Rule by law alone is the precise essential which differentiates our system from\nthe totalitarian system. ... Not law but the will of the Secretary will then govern.\"\n18Justice Frankfurter in Burford v.

Such an Intermediate\nCourt of Appeals with the Supreme Court as a tribunal above it, would not be\ndisposed to foist its personal views upon the public or to decide cases on other\nthan legal precedents and principles. Some measure of stability and uniformity\nin the law, moreover, could thus be introduced and many facets of our way of\nlife, including property rights, no longer ignored.\nThis, moreover, would leave the Supreme Court free to hear mandatory\nappeals and the very occasional cases certified from, or through, such an In\ntermediate Court of Appeals. Perhaps, indeed, the mandatory field could be\nrestricted or limited (as the court has done for itself by the \"insubstantial federal\nquestion\" doctrine) and all cases relegated to the realm of certiorari - somewhat\nas in the New York appellate practice. Special provision, in certain limited cases,\nfor sidetracking the Intermediate Court of Appeals and proceeding directly to\nthe Supreme Court might also be provided.\nThis proposal, it appears to me, might to a long way toward solving the\ndifficulties before recounted, yielding a stabilizing single-court review, to which\nour citizenry is entitled and which the Constitution contemplated, but releasing\nthe Supreme Court itself from all cases but those that it should be required to\nhear and carefully to consider and decide. The proposal could serve, moreover,\nto protect the court from most of the citizenship-diversity appeals that clutter\nits schedule, and as to which there has been great criticism.\nAncillary benefits from such an intermediate tribunal would inure in other\ncases of jurisdictional dispute between the Supreme Court justices, as in Florida\nLime and Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Jacobsen, et al.\n, where the objection\nwas raised by Justices Frankfurter and Douglas that the effect of the decision\nof a three-judge District Court enjoining a State statute on the grounds of its\nunconstitutionality not only serves to expand the Supreme Court's\nobligatory jurisdiction but contradicts the dominant principle of hav\n98 - 101 (1928); Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S. 1392, p. 1871,\n75th Congress, 1st Session(1937).\n23Robert H.

Lawyers have heretofore histor\nically protected our freedoms with their checks and balances. These are now\nin serious jeopardy from within. We of the present generation should not be\nfound wanting in our interest and determination to find a prompt and workable\nremedy.\n25Certiorari granted 361 U.S. 808; dismissed (1960) as improvidently granted.\n\nCreate or Perish\n\nChapter 9\nA Formula for Economic Decline\nWhile this book in some portions has covered a fairly large canvas, it has specif\nically dealt with the need to revamp the patent laws, or at least return their\npractice to the original intent of the founding fathers of the nation as stated in\nArticle I of the Constitution. At this time, I would like to stress that this is\nbut one small part of a much larger picture. In fact, if this picture were viewed\nas a work of pointlisne, that school of painting in which the whole is developed\nby the employment of thousands of small dots of color instead of brush strokes,\npatent reform would be but a single though arresting dot.\nThe larger pictures is that after developing an industrial technology that can\nand has outproduced the world - after investing sixteen billion dollars annually\nin research - what this nation would seem to have acquired is a sure-fire formula\nfor economic decline.\nIf there is any doubt that our creative industrial capability is standing still -\nand to stand still is to lose ground in modern technology - consider that for the\nthird successive time in as many decades the automobile industry again appears\nas the only prime mover capable of pulling the country out of the economic\ndoldrums. But this time it is increasingly evident that even that great industry,\nno matter how prodigious and brilliant its performance, cannot single-handedly\nabsorb all the unemployed and lift the gross national product growth rate to\nthe desired and necessary level.\nWhile we have always considered ourselves as the most inventive of all mod\nern nations - with the telephone, the combine harvester, the electric lamp, the\nmass-produced airplane and automobile as icons of this faith - the truth of the\nmatter is that modification rather than innovation has become the accepted rule\nin American industry. Plastics, processed foods, outboard motors and synthetic\ntextiles all appeared in the marketplace before World War II.\n9.1\nThe Pity of Serendipity\nDespite vast expenditures in research and the siren song of serendipity with its\npromise that our probings into space would result in unexpected discoveries,\nthat they would unlock a cornucopia flow of new, amazing, and revolutioniz\n\nCreate or Perish\ning products that would change all prior concepts of living and accelerate the\neconomy at a rate never envisioned before, nothing more remarkable than some\ncooking utensils can be traced directly to this mighty effort. And even here the\nmanufacturer denies NASA's claim that these articles are a result of space re\nsearch. The fact is that American technology has not developed a major product\nthat every family has felt a compelling need to acquire since television.\nNot only is private industrial research not paying off, but the expected spill\nover from the titanic technological expenditures of the government has yet to\nappear.\nOne of my friends, who has never been an alarmist, said that he didn't real\nize the trouble we are in until seeing the furor in print that greeted the advent\nof colored film for the Land Polaroid camera. \"It certainly is a distinguished\nand creditable accomplishment, but the only thing 'awesome' about it is that\nNewsweek should use that word to describe it.\" He went on to say that nothing\nhe had read had so disturbed him since Calvin Coolidge's 1928 pronouncement\nthat the miniature golf boom of that year would prevent any recession or de\npression.\n9.2\n\"Mind-Forged Manacles\"\nThere has been some expressed concern. A member of the President's cabinet\nhas admitted that \"international competition is beginning to run rings around\nus. The nation's research effort is not producing the new consumer products, the\nnew machines, the new industrial process that the country needs for a growing\nhealthy economy.\"\nScientists in top management posts are not unduly alarmed. \"There is an\nadequate base for pure research, but is has just not been applied,\" insists the\ndirector of long range planning for an industrial giant noted for its research\ndepth. Other august opinions are: \"We are not lacking in the capability to\ninvent. Where we have trouble is in the incentive to invent.\" and \"Increasing\nthe economic rewards would give a real lift to U.S. inventiveness.\n. . . It's a\nmatter of getting the risks and incentives into balance.\"\nUnfortunately there is more to the matter than just getting risks and incen\ntives into balance. If this were all, patent reform and recognition by the courts\nand government of the risks involved could probably restore the old incentives\nthat in the first stages of the technological revolution enabled America to race\nahead and provide a stream of goods on a scale never seen before. It was a time\nwhen Thomas A. Edison, \"Tin-Lizzie\" Henry Ford , Willie \"Airbrake\" West\ninghouse, Alexander Graham Bell, Wilbur and Orville Wright were folk heroes\nand every other American youth dreamed of emulating them.\nToday, not a single contemporary inventor is a household name, and most\nindustry is so shackled with what William Blake termed \"mind-forged manacles\"\nthat it is extremely doubtful that Edison, Ford, or Bell would be employed and,\nif employed, allowed to function successfully by the companies that now bear\ntheir names - for all three were nonconformists in terms of what are now firmly\nestablished industrial management rules and personnel selection procedures.\n\nA Formula for Economic Decline\n9.3\n\"Conformity Is a Psychotic State\"\nApplied to the present state of industrial and technological organization in these\nUnited States and the mounting challenges we face, there may be more truth\nthan shock value in this diagnosis by playwright Clifford Odets. He insists rather\nviolently that \"this is the frontier that has to be opened. This is a new kind of\nCalvinism that allows no individualism. It is a frightening phenomenon and as\nrigid as any Calvin ever practiced.\"\nWhether this is a new kind of Calvinism and psychotic is certainly debatable,\nbut that conformity is the enemy of innovation is not. And since conformity is\nthe climate in most large business organizations, we may have pair far too high\na price for some of our greatly revered achievements in mass production and\nmanagement.\n9.4\nMental Containers\nAccording to office wits, nothing is more sacred to executives than a table-of\norganization chart. This is probably true, for the had of the nation's largest\nadvertising agency seemed to realize that he was treading on dangerous ground\nwhen he said, \"It never has been our idea that the organization structure should\nbe complicated or an end in itself.\"\nOrganization charts can be impressive\nand yet have no meaning - in fact can be restrictive. Whether or not a large\ncorporation or organization can function without charts to clarify the lines or\nexecutive responsibility has no bearing on creativity and inventive incentives -\nbut the outlined rectangles that dangle down like earring ornaments in these\npaper pyramids do.\nProbably the most effective mental container ever devised is the t.o. box -\nit lets little fresh thought in, and none out. If that is its main purpose, it is\ncertainly successful. But if the encouragement of creative thinking and action\nis an objective of a firm or organization, then it is the greatest barrier Man has\never erected against himself. Every week more ideas are smashed, squashed, and\nignored within four ruled sides than were suppressed by the Spanish Inquisition\nin the four centuries of that institution's existence.\nFormer Olympic diving champion Fred V. Zendar, now a consultant in\noceanic research for both government and private industry, recently made some\nrather penetrating comments on the subject of chains of command and lines of\ncommunication. He said, \"In all big organizations there is a submerged layer\nthat effectively blocks all communication from above and below. Oddly enough,\nsonar has detected a similar stratum of blocking water in the oceans, but here\nthe level itself doesn't remain stationary but periodically rises and sinks and\nsometimes parts.\"\nHe wrily added, \"No such phenomena seem to occur in\nits human counterpart.\" When asked what this layer is composed of, Zendar,\nwho was a favorite fishing and flying companion of Ernest Hemingway and who\ndoesn't mind putting his shots below the waterline, replied, \"In both cases, sus\npended silt. But I imagine if you examined it closely you'd find plankton and\ndead minute marine life in one; supervisors and paper-shufflers in the other.\"\n\nCreate or Perish\n9.5\nThe Degree Slide Rule Won't Work This Time\nCertainly if the aim is to reinvigorate creativity - and for industry and the nation\nto survive it must be - special attention must be paid to personnel procurement\nprocesses.\nIn educational circles there is already a wide divergence of opinion regarding\ncollege admission and aptitude test interpretations. Two University of Chicago\npsychologists hold that a high IQ is not a reliable sign of \"giftedness\" and may\nsimply indicate mental grey-flannelism. In one series of experiments they found\nthat 30 veritable Quiz Kids with IQs of about 150 showed few creative abilities,\nwhile an equal number in a much lower bracket were exceptionally good at\nputting facts into exciting new forms.\nAt Cambridge University in England, physical science students were found to\nbe less intellectually flexible than art specialists and more restricted emotionally.\nIt was found also that the ability to deal logically with facts and the ability to\nsee new ways of doing things do not necessarily go together.\nOf course, to a patent attorney, this is neither new nor surprising. The roll\ncall of great inventors reveals that the initial \"breakthrough\" discoveries were\noften the brain children of men singularly lacking in expert knowledge in the\nfields that they ultimately revolutionized. Or as Sir Henry Bessemer, inventor\nof the steel-making process that bears his name, put it, \"I had no fixed ideas\nderived from long established practice to control and bias my mind.\"\nAll of this indicates that if the genes of inventiveness are to be sought and\nrecognized, current yardsticks and measuring rules will have to be discarded.\nThis will, or course, call for re-education of the sternest sort and a complete\nre-orientation of management thinking. Up to now the employment interviewer\nand personnel procurement manager have been able to play it safe by operating\nwithin a few time-tested guidelines tailored to the safe customs, folkways, and\nbeliefs of this organization. Some of these shibboleths are unbelievable until one\naccepts the fact that every corporation is really a self-contained subculture.\nHere are a few gathered at random: a S.B. will fit one job . . . another rates\na Sc.M. . . . but a Sc.D. would be overqualified. . . . Anyone holding both a S.B.\nand LL.B. is apt to prove argumentative with his superiors. So far quite basic\nand undoubtedly time-tested.\nBut listen to these: a man who has worked\nthree different places in less than five years is either unstable or a \"drifter.\"\n. . . rockhunters are dependable. . . . drivers of low gas consuming compact cars\nare seldom absentees.\n. . . sports car addicts are just the opposite, but often\nmake good application engineers. . . . skiiers usually write good proposals.\nHow to press home the hard fact that the supposedly unstable man made\nthree changes because he found the tasks assigned boring and offering no chal\nlenge to his talents, or that one \"drifter\" is apt to prove more creative than fifty\nhandbook engineers or benchwarming drones is something that I would like to\ncall to the attention of the various schools of business administration and see\nwhat they come up with.\n\nA Formula for Economic Decline\n9.6\nA New Use for Senior Scientific Statesmen\nThat many established ways of doing things are held in place not by logic\nor even by habit but by the enormous restraining force of vested interests is\nacknowledged by all who have studied the problem. And in many cases, the\n\"vested interests\" of employees, particularly at the supervisory level, have been\nfound to be as strong as those of top executives, if not stronger.\nFor this reason instead of launching a direct attack on the deadly rigidity\nwhich stifles innovation and inventiveness in many organizations, or even at\ntempting to eradicate the choking underbrush of custom and precedent which\nsmothers originality, a new approach to the situation has been proposed and, in\nthe case of one government department, has been given a trial run. This new\napproach calls for the creation of a new profession which will function outside\nregular channels of administrative responsibility and lines of authority, will be\ncapable of gaining and maintaining the confidence of all employees, will be able\nto intimidate supervisory retaliation, and will at all times have access to and\nthe respect of top management.\nThis calls for a large order in a man. But fortunately there are ready and\navailable a number of men of this stature. These men are our senior scientific\nstatesmen who have passed the age of compulsory retirement in corporations\n(many of which they headed) and have reached emeritus standing in our great\ntechnical educational institutions.\nAmong their ranks are some of our most\nrenowned inventors, respected educators, experienced administrators, and orig\ninal thinkers in almost every scientific discipline. In the opinion of the Board\nof Governors of The Academy of Applied Science, these men represent a na\ntional resource which in our present predicament it would be treason to leave\nimmobile. It may be added that The Academy of Applied Science is compiling\na roster and setting up an activity that will make this great national resource\navailable to the country.\n9.7\nCreate or Perish\nWhile the particular problems I have enumerated in this summary would seem\nto be the particular province of management, boards of directors, stockholders,\nand possibly the investing public, such is not the case.\nCreativity and any\nobstacles to it that exist or are put in its path are the concern of every person\nin the United States, and apply to every section of society and every field of\nendeavor. The conquest of disease can be seriously delayed, the most promising\ninquires into the nature and control of illness, the rate of new drug discovery\nwhich will enable us to score an ultimate victory over heart disease, cancer, and\nmental illness, are all jeopardized when incentives for research are not given\nample recognition, but instead are objects for demogogic political attack.\nWe have all rather facetiously referred to the disappearance of the buggy-\nwhip manufacturers, but how many of us realize that the flight engineering craft,\nwhich promised such a roseate future to hundreds of thousands of people, has\nhad a life span of but fifteen years - from the coming in of the multi-engine\npropeller plane to its replacement by the jet. That in another year only two\n\nCreate or Perish\nof our great plane makers will be making planes and that the nation has just\nabout decided to sit out the next round - supersonic carriers.\nVexing unemployment will become more and more a civic problem as whole\ncommunities and even states are dealt broadside blows by the increasing tempo\nof skill obsolescence. The answer is not as one government spokesman has said\nthat the American craftsman should not seek permanence in residence and the\nschooling of his children but should be prepared to migrate like the birds to\nwherever new work opportunities peculiar to his skills arise - but that industry,\ngovernment, finance, and the people themselves should go all out to reinvigorate\nthe creative gift that from the varied nature of our people and our environment\nis our birthright and for nearly two centuries was the identifying mark of our\ngenius.\nCertainly it will call for an overhaul of our educational processes, a reassess\nment of many facets of our technology, and a recognition on the part of the\nscientific community that \"the statesmanship of science requires that science be\nconcerned with more than science.\" But nothing less will do, for time is running\nout.\nDuring the ninety momentous days of the Cuban crisis, we heard a great deal\nabout \"military options\" and there were said to be arguments in the highest\nquarters that the Cuban missile threat was a diversion and that the real Soviet\ngoal was the seizure of Berlin.\nLet there be no argument of misconception about Soviet basic aims. The\narmed threat of total thermonuclear war is the diversion - the Soviet goal is to\ntake over the world by economic and industrial domination.\nHere there are no options. For America and the free world there is only one\ncourse of action -\nCREATE OR PERISH\n\nIndex\nA T & T, 78-80, 97\nAcademy of Applied Science, 40, 102,\n113, 118, 133\nAir Brake, 33, 106\nAirplane, 129\nAlexander Graham Bell, viii, 43-47, 49,\n50, 52-54, 57-60, 95, 105, 130\nAlexander McLean Nicolson, 74, 75, 77-\n79, 81\nAmerican Bar Association, 103\nAmerican Bell Telephone Company, 47-\n49, 60\nAmerican Fruit Growers, 26\nAmerican Institute of Electrical Engi\nneers, 96\nAmerican Speaking and Telephone Com\npany, 48\nAmerican Telephone and Telegraph Com\npany, 74, 77, 99\nAmerican Telephone Company, 58\nAntitrust, 18, 20\nApple Tube, 98\nArmed Services Procurement Regula\ntions, 67\nAtomic Energy Act, 6, 11\nAtomic Energy Act of 1946, 68\nAtomic Energy Commission (AEC), 6,\n67-69\nAtomic Energy Commissions (AEC),\nAttorney General, 48\nAutomobile, 129\nAutotransformers, 91\nBall-Point Pen, 96\nBarbed Wire, 37, 106\nBell Telephone Cases, viii, 22, 24, 43,\n49, 50\nBenvenuto Cellini, 59, 60, 87, 90, 105\nBessemer Process, 132\nBoard of Appeals, 12-15, 27, 78, 91,\nBoard of Patent Interferences, 13\nBourseul, 54, 60\nBritish Patent Office, 3\nBrogdex Company, 26\nBureau of Standards, 64, 65\nCady v.

Though it may not be entirely\nsuited in all respects to our current problems and needs, and though sometimes\nit may have been misused, its record of achievement in the progress of our\ncountry is indelibly written on the pages of history. Its current service, despite\nthe fact that it is not being fully utilized in the second half of the century, seems\nto me equally indisputable; though some critics without firsthand experience in\nthis field may not agree. Those critics are free to write their own books.\nI have undertaken to write mine as a champion of the philosophy that today,\nas much as ever, incentives that make a person fight to be an individual promote\nthe welfare the whole state. In my lectures, many of which have been included\nin this book, I frankly paint a picture, particularly for engineers and applied\nscientists, that is based on this philosophy and thus supports patents1\nBut invention, patents, and innovation cannot be treated apart from their\nsocial, political, and economic environment, despite mechanistic courses given\nin law schools. Thus, to review the principles of patent law without delving into\nthe interplay of many aspects of our society would be to discuss a theoretical,\nnonexistent system. This book, therefore, is not addressed solely to engineers\nand applied scientists; some parts are addressed to lawyers, economists, busi\nnessmen, and politicians.\nI have found the problem of presenting all facets so that they may be under\nstood by readers of quite varied disciplines to be not without difficulty. For this\nreason illustrations have been confined to technology that can readily be com\nprehended by nontechnicians, and legal and economic discussions have been kept\nsufficiently elementary to be grasped at least in part by the technical reader,\nbut without sacrificing the point intended for the legalist or economist.\nThose who expect an engineering \"cookbook\" approach to this subject will\nnot find it here. Similarly, those who look for a presentation in the form of a\nProcrustean \"case study\" will be equally disappointed.\nTo write an interdisciplinary book requires a mixture of interdisciplinary\ntechniques, and so I have tried to interweave history, primary principles, proce\ndures, problems, and points of conflict into what I believe to be the true fabric\npattern of the patent system, struggling to stay alive in a world of rapid change.\nBecause of this somewhat unorthodox approach, I have summarized the scope\n1Gordon McKay Lectures on Patent Law, given at Harvard University, 1956-58.\n\nCreate or Perish\nof each chapter at its head, and, in some cases, the reason for the approach used\nin order that the reader may better understand my mode or presentation.\nIn Chapter 1, a survey of the origin and historical background of the Amer\nican patent system is presented; and, at its conclusion, serious questions are\nraised as to whether that system is currently either effectively performing its\noriginal historical purposes or meeting the requirements of the present. I hope\nthat by the end of the book, the reader may have gained an insight into some\nof the answers to these questions.\nChapter 2 reviews the role of the Patent Office and the courts in adminis\ntration of the patent laws, especially for the benefit of those unfamiliar with the\nadministrative details of patent application prosecution and judicial review.\nThe statutory provisions of American patent law are discussed in Chapter\n3, with reference to actual cases interpreted and decided by the courts. While\nthe classes of patentable inventions and the conditions of patentability can be\nreadily agreed upon, there is widespread conflict as to the standard set by the\n1952 Patent Act to determine what is \"invention\" and what is \"obvious.\" I\nhave, accordingly, devoted a section of this chapter to discussing this conflict,\ngiving my own views - predicated upon what I feel is in the national interest,\nnamely an interpretation that encourages the independent American inventor\nand his backers as well as corporate inventors. In this connection the chapter\nconcludes with statistics offered by leading independent inventors pointing up\ntheir vital current contributions to technology and the necessity for liberal and\nsympathetic legal recognition of their work if the independent inventor is not to\ndisappear from the American scene.\nIn Chapter 4, I have carried forward an illustrative approach found most\neffective in lecturing: tying together the complete picture of innovation - from\nthe conception and invention stage, through financial backing and development,\nentrepreneuring, business formation, and legal contests with pirates. Here I have\nused the medium of the Bell Telephone Cases, because this outdated invention\ninvolves technology and a degree of importance familiar to all readers, and\nbecause almost everything that could happen did happen to Bell, except the\nanonymity experienced by many current inventors from which he was saved by\na single vote in the Supreme Court.\nStrongly woven through the fabric of the invention-innovation cycle are the\nrelations between inventor and employer and between inventor and potential\nuser or licensee. These include typical industrial, university, and governmental\ncontract provisions. Since inventions are frequently stolen, the pitfalls facing\nthe inventor are reviewed in Chapter 5. There are, however, very few proven\ncases of such piracy, and so I have selected a previously little-known example\n(in the field of piezoelectricity) that took over two decades to document and\nestablish by legal decision. The publication of this exposure, it is hoped, may\nforewarn the inventor, and perhaps give second thoughts to business and govern\nmental agencies in the matter of trying to circumvent the proprietary position\nof inventors.\nChapter 6 discusses critically recent proposals for improving the patent sys\ntem, including current conflicting views in Congress and the courts as to gov\n\nIntroduction\nernment rights in patents and other matters.\nI have left to Chapter 7 a consideration of the exciting modernization pro\ngram being planned by the European Economic Community with the view of\nproviding a single common European patent and law of patents. The possible\neffect of this upon the American system is noted, and some of my own views\nwith regard to possible immediate improvements in the administration of our\nsystem are presented.\nThough one of expected primary groups of readers of this book is the en\ngineering profession, the solution to current problems in the protection of in\nventions and patents calls for more than mere engineering consideration. There\nis a decided, and even primary, legal side concerning which something must be\nsaid. In Chapter 8, therefore, I have supplemented Chapter 7's technical sug\ngestions for Patent Office and administrative improvement with proposals for\nmodernizing judicial review. I have tried to formulate these in language that\nengineers can follow, but without losing their force for the legal and quasi-legal\nprofessionals.\nChapter 9 points up the general economic consequences of the above prob\nlems.\nIf in the end I am considered to have been too harsh on the courts of our\nland, my answer must be that my position is based on more than mere academic\nstudy. My attack is considered, deliberate, and to me necessary. My plea is\nsimple. Before it is too late, let us restore to the individual his importance and\ndignity, and recognize and protect the fruits of his mind. A dynamic society\nled by free and encouraged creative minds - with government back in its role of\nservant and partner - offers the Free World's best hope."

To\nthe authorities of the Greek colony of Sybaris 1, some five hundred years before\nChrist, however, it may well have been \"an unusual and peculiar dish\" that no\none had the right to prepare and serve for a one-year period but the cook who\noriginated it.\nThis official invitation to indigestion is one of the earliest recorded instances\nof a grant paralleling somewhat our concept of a patent granted for an inven\ntion. The policy of grants of numerous kinds by the state to individuals who\nhad deserved well at its hands was inherited by medieval Europe from early\ntimes. Rome, for example, had rewarded her military heroes with triumphal\nprocessions, and had parceled out to them her conquered lands, upon which\nthey might levy taxes. English monarchs exercised the prerogative of granting\na right, franchise, charter, commission, office, monopoly, or the like - for exam\nple, a title of nobility or permission to explore the New World. They did so in\neach case through the medium of a document addressed \"To all to whom these\npresents shall come,\" an open document termed \"Litterae Patentes\" or Letters\nPatent - letters openly recorded in the Patent Rolls.\nThat the English king had good reason for granting at least some kinds of\nletters patent, under proper circumstances, can be understood from the follow\ning considerations.\nMedieval Europe was a barbarous or semibarbarous ter\nritory, not far removed from savagery. Industry and trade were in a precari\nous condition. The nobles, not only in England but also on the Continent, as\n1Athenaeus; The Deipnosophists (3 Vols.), C. D. Yonge, Ed. , Bohn's Classical Library,\n1854, p. 835.\n\nCreate or Perish\nrulers supreme in their particular domains, demanded tolls from all who passed\nthrough their territories. They could do this uncontrolled by their supposedly\nsuperior monarchs, by fortifying themselves on hillsides and other places of ad\nvantage. Not until the invention of gunpowder were these monarchs able to\nbring their nobles under subjection.\nThe trade of those days was conducted by merchants who traveled from coun\ntry to country through the domains of various nobles. Because the merchants\nwere subjected to great expense and risk in the carrying on of their business,\nthey were compelled to charge very high prices for the goods that they intro\nduced for sale in Europe. Many articles were expensive luxuries beyond the\nreach of all but the very wealthiest.\nThe Crusades, beginning in the eleventh century A.D. and continuing for\nseveral centuries more, brought the Europeans into contact with the Saracens,\nat that time a comparatively highly cultured people. They had developed the\narts and were skilled in such sciences as algebra and astronomy, the very word\n\"algebra\" coming from the Arabic.\nUpon returning to their homes, the Crusaders carried with them much that\nthey had found in the East, including knowledge of various arts and industries.\nItalian city-states, such as Genoa and Venice, the most powerful groups of their\nday, developed as a direct result of their proximity to the East. They prospered\nbecause of the trade that they had built up between the East and the West.\nIn order to have something to sell, in return for the goods they obtained in\nthe East, they stimulated new arts and industries by granting monopolies to\nfavored individuals who were willing to take the risks involved. Early grants are\nreported for grain mills, and in 1474 the Venetian Senate voted the first of all\npatent laws applying to all classes of invention. This law forbade infringement\nfor a term of ten years, but gave free access to the government, provided that the\nlatter dealt with the inventor and did not permit others to employ the invention\nin the government's behalf 2 .\nTo protect their trade and the industries they had established, European\nmerchants banded together for common defense organized their own armies\nand navies. During the late Middle Ages they became quite powerful, as the\nHanseatic League attests.\nNot until several centuries later, when new trade\nroutes were opened up after the discovery of the New World, were the Italian\ncity-states reduced to their present status as subdivisions of a larger nation.\nBut the Italian cities were not the only communities thus benefited. The\ngoods and skills germinated by this trade with the East gradually spread over\nthe whole of Europe. Because England was the farthest west and physically\nseparated from the continent, it was not in the most favored position to secure\nthese advantages, which the other states often guarded jealously. To overcome\nthese disadvantages the English monarchs adopted the continental practice of\ngranting patents, usually to foreigners, giving them for limited periods of time\n2This statement is based on information given me by some British patent lawyers who\nremembered hearing a paper entitled, \"The Early History of Patents of Patents for Invention,\"\ngiven by M. Frumian before the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents in England sometime\nin the 1930's.\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nthe exclusive right to carry on such new industries as, in consideration of the\ngrant, they agreed to import into the realm.\nIn this way the cloth industry was introduced into England. In 1331, Edward\nIII granted a patent to John Kempe of Flanders, weaver of woolen cloth, and in\n1336 to Brabant weavers. In 1440, one was issued to John of Shiedame to enable\nhim to import a newly invented process of manufacturing salt3 . The Tudors,\nsuccessors of Edward IV, attracted skilled foreign artisans by negotiations -\nGerman armorers, Italian shipwrights, Normandy glassmakers, and French iron\nworkers4 .\nPatents were also given to individuals and companies for other services to the\nstate, to induce them to embark upon commercial or other ventures involving\nrisk. Among these were the East India Trading Company, chartered by Queen\nElizabeth I, and the Hudsons's Bay Company, still very much a commercial\nforce in Canada, chartered by her immediate successor.\nIn the then relatively undeveloped state of industry and commerce, patents\nof this nature were undoubtedly necessary for the good of the realm and the well\nbeing of its subjects. The objects sought thereby were: first, domestic supply\nof foreign, high-priced goods which would reduce their cost and consequently\nencourage their wider use; and, secondly, employment for English workmen in\nthe new industries thus established. Some of the patents, indeed, specifically\nprovided that English apprentices be employed.\nGomme, late librarian of the British Patent Office5, for example, quotes from\nthe 1449 patent granted by Henry VI to John of Utynam, \". . . to instruct divers\nlieges of the crown in the art of making colored glass.\" It is reported6 that the\nprecipitating cause of this patent grant was the requirement for colored windows\nat Eton College.\nMuch later, the Court of King's Bench clearly enunciated the rationale of\nsuch patents:\nBut if a man hath brought in a new invention and a new trade within\nthe Kingdom, in peril of his life, and consumption of his estate or\nstock . . . or if a man hath made a new discovery of anything, in such\ncases the King . . . in recompense of his costs and travail, may grant\nby charter unto him, that he only shall use such a trade or trafique\nfor a certain time, because at first the people of the Kingdom are\nignorant, and have not the knowledge or skill to use it7 .\nBut beneficent measures are frequently attended by abuses.\nIn granting\ntheir patents, the English kings did not always consider whether or not these\nconferred benefits upon their subjects.\nThe latters' revolt against King John at Runnymede, in 1215, resulted in\nthe famous Magna Carta. The monarch there had to agree that merchants were\n3A. A. Gomme, Patents of Invention, Longmans Green and Co., 1946, p. 12\n4Journal of the Patent Office Society, Vol. 18, pp. 21ff. (1936).\n5A. A. Gomme, Patents of Invention, p. 12\n6H. Hardin, Patent Office Centenary, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1953, pp. 21, 34.\n778 Eng. Rep. 148 (Clothworkers of Ipswich, King's Bench, 1615).\n\nCreate or Perish\nnot to be prohibited from engaging in trade, \"if they were not openly prohibited\nbefore.\" This suggests no upsetting of current patents in trade, but restrictions\non the monarch's power to grant further patents in existing trades.\nThe Magna Carta was not the only contract that the English kings made\nwith their subjects. History shows, however, that the monarchs regarded these\nagreements much as some nations today regard treaties. When, under force of\ncircumstances, kings were compelled to submit to greater force, as in the case\nof John at Runnymede, they signed anything that was put before them; but,\nas soon as the danger was over, they forgot their promises and acted as though\nthey had never given them.\nIn their endeavors to raise money, to reward favorites, and for other reasons,\nsucceeding English monarchs thus granted many patents that became burden\nsome to the people. One person would be given the exclusive right to engage\nin a certain industry, such as tanning; another to trade in soap, salt, starch,\nsaltpeter, leather, paper or glass; another to buy and sell iron or steel; and still\nanother to import certain articles; and so on. Sometimes the monopoly covered\ntrade in all England; at other times, the sale of a particular article in a partic\nular region. As the activities so monopolized had previously been free to the\npublic, the only result was to raise prices which must be paid by the many, that\nthe favored patentees might be enriched.\nIn the fall of 1601, in response to protests, Queen Elizabeth I proclaimed that\nif any of her subjects felt aggrieved or wronged by reason of any of these patent\ngrants, he could test the validity of the patent in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe very next spring, 1602, one Edward D'Arcy brought suit for infringement of\nhis patent grant for making and importing playing cards. The justification for\nthe patent grant had been based upon grounds of public policy, that unless the\ngrant existed subjects who might better \"go to plow did employ themselves in\nthe art of making cards8.\" This is the famous Case of Monopolies. Though the\ncourt held the monopoly on playing cards to be invalid, the case has come down\nthe ages as recognizing the existence of something most important, namely the\nline of division between what is proper and what is improper subject matter for\na patent \"monopoly.\" To quote from the decision,\nWhere any man by his own charge and industry or by his own wit\nor invention doth bring any new trade into the Realm of any Engine\ntending to the furtherance of a trade that never was used before;\nAnd that for the good of the Realm; That in such cases the King\nmay grant to him a monopoly patent for some reasonable time until\nthe subjects may learn the same, in consideration of the good that\nhe doth bring by his Invention to the Commonwealth; otherwise not.\nThis has been the law in England up to the present time. One can still\nobtain a patent in Great Britain, not merely for an invention that he has made,\nbut also for a new article or idea imported from outside the realm.\n8D'Arcy v. Allen, 11 Coke 86 (1602), known as the Case of Monopolies.\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nNotwithstanding the D'Arcy decision, the very next monarch, James I, who\nascended the throne in 1603, granted more monopolies than ever, including some\nfor silk and even inns. The cry against harmful monopolies in Great Britain\naccordingly grew in vigor, until, finally, by the Statute of Monopolies in 1623,\nParliament deprived the sovereign completely of this prerogative.\nThe Statute of Monopolies made an exception, however, in favor of patents\nfor inventions - the very same exception that the judges had indicated in the\nD'Arcy case, and which was really, in effect, declaratory of the common law, i.\ne., that no special privilege would be granted for \" . . . any letters patent and\ngrants of privilege for the term of fourteen years or under hereafter to be made\nof the sole working or making of any manner of new manufacture within this\nRealm to the true and first inventor and inventors of such manufactures which\nother at the time of making of such letters patent and grants shall not use so\nas also they be not contrary to the law nor mischievous to the State by raising\nprices of commodities at home or hurt of trade or generally inconvenient9.\"\nBoth the English and the American laws of patents10 come directly from\nthis exception for inventions, and the very provision quoted above still exists as\nSection 6 of the present British Statute of Monopolies.\nThe American colonists were fully acquainted with patents, and knew their\nvalue under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Statute of Monopolies.\nLike the mother country, several of the colonies, prior to the Constitutional\nConvention, had granted patents in the endeavor to introduce industries. The\npatents were not necessarily for new inventions, but sometimes for old industries,\nif brought in from abroad, and also for fostering those struggling for survival.\nThe encouragement of industries was achieved not only by the grant of monop\nolies in special enactments of the local legislature, corresponding to the English\ngrants from the Crown, but also through the medium of premiums, bounties,\nand the like.\nFully aware, when granting these perquisites, of the monopolistic evils in\nthe country whence they had come, the colonists took precautions against a\nrepetition of those evils. For example, the Massachusetts General Court (the\ncolonial legislature) in 1641 enacted that \"There shall be no monopolies granted\nor allowed among us, but of such new inventions as are profitable to the country,\nand that for a short time.\" Connecticut had a similar provision. Massachusetts,\nConnecticut, Virginia, South Carolina, New York, and other colonies granted\na number of patents covering different methods of making salt, some invented\nand others imported, and sometimes on condition that saltworks be established\nwithin a limited time. Similar patents covering the exclusive manufacture of\nother articles, and often on similar conditions, were granted by the colonists.\nThese included the manufacture of iron and of machinery, a sawmill, a grain\nmill, and a tobacco pipe factory.\nThe first patent granted by the Massachusetts General Court, pursuant to\nthe enactment of 1641, was one to Samuel Winslow (1641) for a novel method\n9Statute of Monopolies, 21 Jac. I, C.3 (1623).\n10Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 327, 328; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co.,\n243 U.S. 502, 510, 511.\n\nCreate or Perish\nof making salt. The first machinery patent granted by the same body was to\nJoseph Jenkes, in 1646, for a scythe-manufacturing mill. In 1667, Massachusetts\noffered a fifteen-year monopoly to anyone who would build a dry dock, and, the\noffer apparently not proving sufficiently attractive, the term of years was in\ncreased in the following year to twenty-one. Several of the colonies continued to\ngrant patents, even after they became states upon the adoption of the Constitu\ntion. New York, for example, issued one to Livingston and Fulton covering the\nexclusive right to operate steamboats in New York waters, a patent later an\nnulled by Chief Justice Marshall as being in violation of the interstate-commerce\nclause of the Constitution.\nThe delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, fully familiar with\nall the circumstances, desired to provide the new nation with the benefits of\na patent system.\nBoth James Madison of Virginia and Charles Pinckney of\nSouth Carolina, therefore, proposed that Congress be given certain powers in\nthat direction. Madison's proposal was that it should have power: \"To secure to\nliterary authors their copyrights for a limited time. To encourage by premiums\nand provisions, the advance of useful knowledge and discoveries.\"\nParenthetically, the Atomic Energy Commission is doing the very thing to\nday that Madison suggested so long ago11 . Certain types of inventions deal\ning with the production of fissionable material and atomic weapons cannot be\npatented under the exclusion provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. An inventor\nmay, however, make a claim for remuneration for his contribution, and, un\nder certain standards that have been set up, may be awarded a sum of money\nby the Commission. From a study of the unclassified awards and experience\nwith the AEC, some authorities believe that the Constitutional founders were\nmost wise in rejecting Madison's proposal. They are convinced that the failure\nof the nuclear program to get off the ground more rapidly and extensively, in\nthe way and to the same degree that our free-enterprise inventive efforts with\nother nongovernment-controlled programs have historically blossomed for the\ncommon good, may be due, in part, to the inadequacy of this kind of so-called\nincentive.\nCharles Pinckney disliked Madison's proposal that the government should\nevaluate and pay out sums of money for inventions. His own proposal was that\nCongress should have the power \"to grant patents for useful inventions.\nTo\nsecure to authors exclusive rights for a certain time.\" Under this concept, the\ncompetitive industrial marketplace would determine the value of an invention.\nAs it emerged from committee and as adopted by the Convention, the Con\nstitution provided, and still provides, in Article I, Section 8, that Congress shall\nhave power: \"To promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by secur\ning for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their\nrespective Writings and Discoveries.\"\nPursuant to this provision, Congress could have granted to a person who\nmakes a scientific discovery the exclusive right to his own discovery. The Con\n1142 U.S.C. 2187 (Sec. 157). (The abbreviation U.S.C. refers to the United States Code -\na collected body of federal law.)\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\nstitution uses the words \"Science,\" \"exclusive right,\" \"discoveries 12.\" As will\nbe made evident, however, Congress has provided for exclusive rights only in\ncases of certain kinds of advances and not for scientific discoveries per se.\nThis provision is the only one in the whole Constitution which relates to the\ncreation of private property rights and was intended to promote the progress of\nscience and the useful arts. It rested on the great tradition and philosophy of\nour capitalistic system - the granting of limited protection to the individual in\ndeveloping ideas for the benefit of the many.\nNothing, it will be noted, is said in this provision about granting patents\nas such. The word \"securing\" is used instead. Madison later explained, in the\nFederalist papers, that, though the word \"securing\" was appropriate only in\nconnection with copyrights, which had been recognized as a natural property\nright at common law, there was no reason why the same principles should not\napply to inventions: \"The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason\nto belong to the inventors. The public seems with equal reason to belong to\nthe inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of\nindividuals.\"\nJefferson, however, declined to accept the view that inventions belonged to\ninventors as a natural right. He felt that they were for the benefit of the whole\nsociety.\nAfter the adoption of the Constitution, President Washington recommended\nlegislation in furtherance of this constitutional provision, and a statute was\nenacted by the very first Congress, in 1790. The founders of the Union thought\nthe matter so important that they provided therein that the Secretary of State\n(Thomas Jefferson), in collaboration with the Secretary of War (Henry Knox\nof Massachusetts) and the Attorney General (Edmund Randolph of Virginia),\nshould examine all patent applications, and the President and the Secretary of\nState should personally sign the patent grant. That body of three eminent men,\nJefferson, Knox, and Randolph, in effect constituted the first Patent Office of\nthis country, with Jefferson the first patent examiner, commissioner, and lawyer.\nWashington, Jefferson, and Randolph signed the first patents.\nJefferson, though, opposed to all forms of monopoly, and at first including\npatents in this category, was compelled as a result of his experience to state that\nthe patent law gave \"a spring to invention beyond my conception,\" and that,\ntherefore, \"nobody wishes more that I that ingenuity should receive a liberal\nencouragement13.\"\nBefore a patent could be issued under the law of 1790, it was necessary\nthat the application be carefully examined to determine whether the purported\ninvention, in the terms of the statute, was \"before known or used\" and whether it\nwas really \"sufficiently useful and important\" to warrant the dignity of a patent\n12There is a great doubt whether this word \"Science\" as used in the Constitution, meant\nwhat we mean today. My own study leads me to the conviction that the term \"science\" in\nthe constitutional sense, was used, rather, with philosophical and literary concepts primarily\nin mind.\n13In a letter to Oliver Evans, May 2, 1807, as given in The Writings of Thomas Jefferson,\nA. E. Bergh, Ed., 1907, Vol. 5, p. 74.\n\nCreate or Perish Photograph of the first United States Patent Grant, July 31, 1790. Signed by George Washington.\nFig. 1.1: The first United States Patent Grant, July 31, 1790 (Reproduced from\nthe original in the collection of the Chicago Historical Society. This image is\npublic domain and is not protected by copyright.)\ngrant.\nBefore three years had elapsed, however, the \"sufficiently useful and\nimportant\" condition was removed from the statute, and patents were issued by\nmere registration and not by examination; but the matter was still under the\nauspices of the State Department. Chaos followed - frauds, vexatious litigations,\nmultiple conflicting patents, and so on.\nAt the urging of Senator John Ruggles of Maine, some forty-odd year later,\nthe \"American\" system of granting patents only after examination was rein\nstated by the Patent Act of 1836 , and the Patent Office was reorganized and\nestablished as a separate bureau of the State Department, with the bureau chief\nformally titled commissioner of patents. The Patent Office was subsequently\ntransferred to the Department of the Interior, upon the latter's establishment\nin 1849; and later, in 1926, it was given its present status in the Department of\nCommerce. There has long been, and still is, agitation for making the Patent\nOffice an entirely separate executive branch14, perhaps with expanded functions\nmore suited to current national needs. But such expanded and modernized func\ntions still seem to fit in the responsibilities of the Department of Commerce.\n14Journal of the Patent Office Society, Vol. 40, pp. 10 - 17 (1958).\n\nDevelopment of the American Patent System\n1.1\nConclusion\nIt is important to note that the historical purposes that lay behind our patent\nsystem were primarily concerned with the matter of innovation and not bald\ninvention alone.\nThe object was not merely to grant patents; rather it was to encourage the\nfew inventive minds among us to take the risks inherent in introducing new\nproducts and arts or processes into the stream of commerce, for the ultimate\nbenefit of the many.\nThis encouragement took the form of a contract: the\nsovereign offering the inventor limited protection against copying in return for\nthe publication of the details of his invention; and it rested upon the theory,\nnow ironically applied more effectively by the Soviets than by us, that rewards\nto the individual benefit the public at large.\nAn additional purpose was to prevent, through the publication of inventions\nin patents, a recurrence of loss of arts such as had happened formerly when\nknowledge was handed down from father to son secretly.\nBut whether today's patent system in America, its administration and its\ntreatment by the judiciary, is an effective stimulus to innovation, has become a\nquestion of the utmost importance and urgency.\nDoes the system offer that kind of security to the inventor and his backers\nthat stimulates ready embarkation upon the risky road of innovation?\nDo its rewards stimulate the myriad engineers who, as a condition of their\nemployment in much of industry and government, have assigned to their em\nployers all their rights to any inventions they may make?\nHas its use in certain large corporate quarters been reduced largely to de\nfensive and cross-licensing needs, as distinguished from protecting an exclusive\nposition as a stimulus to innovation?\nAre we today really worried about \"lost arts\"?\nDoes the system promote the progress of useful military, nuclear, and space\narts?\nIn short, has our patent system been largely reduced in many fields to the\ngranting of papers with red seals - mostly form and little substance?"

This chapter, obviously,\nwill be of little interest for those knowledgeable in this field.\nPerhaps an interesting way to trace the procedure would be to stand in the\nshoes of an imaginary independent inventor in the first flush of success in the\ncompletion of an invention. In order to obtain a patent for it, he must submit\nfor examination by the Patent Office a detailed description that, by law, must\nbe in a certain subscribed form and be couched in legal terminology generally\nquite foreign to those who produce inventions as well as to nonlegal persons\nin general. The patent application itself must contain a clear and concise de\nscription of the invention (termed here the specification), usually with reference\nto drawings illustrating a preferred form of the device, and a set of succinct\nterminal paragraphs, called claims, setting forth the features of novelty which\nthe inventor and his attorney believe the Patent Office should allow as defining\nthe scope of the patent grant.\n2.1\nThe Nature of the Patent Office\nIt will be remembered that the Constitution authorized Congress to promote\nthe progress of useful arts by securing to inventors for limited periods of time\nthe exclusive rights to their discoveries. It has previously been pointed out,\nhowever, that, apart from a few questionably-handled procedures, as under\nthe compensation provisions of the Atomic Energy Act or the Space Act, pure\nscientists have not been rewarded by Congress. Instead, the latter has seen fit\nto enact patent laws applicable to the applied scientist and engineer, who takes\n\nCreate or Perish\nthe discoveries of the pure scientist and makes useful arts out of them. In 1952,\nCongress codified the patent laws, adding, however certain modifications that\npurported to eliminate or at least curb the disposition of some courts to strike\ndown patents as a matter of social philosophy.\nThe statute itself defines the structure of the Patent Office and the mode\nof its operation, charging the commissioner of patents with the responsibility\nfor the examination of every patent application and for the issuance of every\npatent (and trademark). Thus the Patent Office must maintain a vast up-to-date\ntechnical library, otherwise the patent examiners assisting the commissioner will\nnot have the facilities for making reasonably thorough investigations.\nThe commissioner is further assisted by an appellate board in the Patent\nOffice, termed the Board of Appeals. The members of the Board, like the com\nmissioner, are appointed by the president and are given the title of examiners-\nin-chief. Their function is primarily to pass on final rejections by the examining\ncorps which deny the patentability of the claimed inventions. Fortunately, they\nare selected from the experienced ranks of the Patent Office personnel and are\nnot, as yet, purely political appointees.\nBefore our inventor's newly filed patent application is examined for novelty, it\nis screened by classification examiners to determine whether the subject matter\nproperly relates to the class of inventions handled by a particular group of\nskilled examiners. Since, however, applications are normally examined in the\norder received, and since there is, on the average, a year's backlog of cases, our\ninventor will probably have to wait that long before his application is reached.\nWhen the examiner assigned to the case reaches the application, he (or\nshe) studies it with particular attention to the claims of novelty which he is\nrequested to allow. These claims, if allowed, represent the metes and bounds or\nscope of the patent grant. The examiner then goes to the division files of patents\nand publications, which are broken down into many thousands of classes and\nsubclasses, and starts his search. He is looking for the prior art that is closest to\nthe concept claimed to be new. He looks not only for the exact device described\nin the application, but also for others similar to it. If the patent attorney in\nthe case has made his own search before filing the application and failed to find\nan exact anticipation, it is likely that the examiner will not find one either.\nHowever, even if the invention is not found in any prior patent or publication,\nbut is the kind of thing that any mechanic skilled is the art could easily evolve\nfrom what is in a prior patent or publication, the device is not patentable.\nHaving completed his search, the examiner usually takes the course of re\njecting the application on the basis of the closest prior art that he was able\nto find. There is a very definite reason for this. Being a conscientious public\nservant, the examiner is not disposed to hand out patents unless he is convinced\nthat a really new invention has been made 1 . By rejecting the case, he puts the\nburden of proof on the applicant to explain why the latter should be granted a\n1If our judiciary could only experience, as practicing lawyers, the difficulty involved in\nsuccessfully prosecuting a patent application in the Patent Office, their respect for patents\nwould undoubtedly increase\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\npatent although others may have come as close to his purported invention as in\nthe prior art cited by the examiner.\nThe attorney for the applicant must then reply within six months of the\nexaminer's rejection, pointing out why the prior art is not pertinent to his\nclient's claim of novelty, and, if the original claims did not clearly define that\nnovelty, appropriately amending those claims.\nThis process of rejection (or\npartial rejection) and amendment or argument continues until the examiner\nfeels that an issue has been reached. In some cases, the examiner will allow the\namended claims or, upon reconsideration, the original claims, or some of them,\nand the patent will thereupon be granted and will take its place among over\nthree million United States patents. In other cases, the examiner will not be\npersuaded as to the matter of invention. The applicant's attorney insists; the\nexaminer is adamant that there is no invention and makes his rejection final.\nSometimes the attorney will interview the examiner in person. He may then\nask the primary examiner to review the assistant's decisions. At a conference,\nthe assistant examiner gives the primary examiner his reasons for rejection,\nand the attorney presents his side of the case, perhaps with the help from the\ninventor himself. The primary examiner then makes his decision. If he agrees\nwith the attorney, he overrules his assistant and allows the application so that\nthey patent may issue. If, on the other hand, he feels that the assistant is right,\nhe will not overrule him, but will suggest that the attorney turn to the Board\nof Appeals.\nThe attorney, in the latter event, files a brief before the Board in which\nhe describes the history of the case, the nature and details of the invention,\nthe meaning of the rejected claims, the prior art cited by the examiner upon\nwhich the adverse ruling was based, and the reasons, factual and legal, why the\nattorney considers the examiner to be in error. The examiner then files a reply\nbrief presenting his views, and the case may be decided by the Board of Appeals\non these two briefs alone. An oral argument may, however, be requested. The\nattorney will appear before the Board to argue his case, but the examiner from\nwhom the appeal is taken usually does not appear at the hearing.\nThe Board may then sustain the examiner's rejection, or overrule it and\norder the patent to be granted. Sometimes the Board finds that, while it cannot\nsustain the examiner's position, the claims are not patentable for reasons other\nthan those advanced by the examiner. In such an event, it will offer its own\ngrounds for rejection, permitting the applicant to modify his claims in order to\novercome the new objections or to ask for reconsideration of the new grounds.\nWhenever two or more applicants are claiming the same invention, \"inter\nference\" examiners are assigned the task of trying to determine who is actually\nthe first inventor. Testimony is usually taken before a notary public or court\nofficer, subject to cross-examination, and other evidence of invention activities\nsubmitted by the conflicting applicants. Aided by these, as well as by briefs and\noral argument, a Board of Patent Interferences makes a decision as to who is\nthe prior inventor.\nThe commissioner cannot by himself, of course, decide or give attention to\nthe administration of all these matters. He therefore has several assistant com\n\nCreate or Perish\nmissioners of patents. And, parenthetically, lest it be considered that Russians\nare the only ones who utilize the talents of women in technical fields, we have\nrecently been ably served by a lady assistant commissioner of patents on matters\nregarding trademarks.\n2.2\nPatent Office Problems\nWhen there is a rapid turnover in the examining crops because of attractive\noffers from outside organizations, particularly to the younger examiners, the\nbacklog of cases obviously mounts. The effectiveness and utility of the whole\npatent system are thereby damaged. Perhaps the greater administrative prob\nlems facing the Patent Office, therefore, are, first convincing the public and\nCongress of the importance of its functions; and, second, the urgent necessity\nfor promptly dignifying the position of examiner so that it will attract competent\ncareer men and women.\nAutomation in the form of electronic computers may come to help in the\nsearching process. Indeed, an interesting experiment for facilitating the exam\niner's search in certain limited chemical cases by computer techniques is under\nway.\nWhether sufficient time and money will ever be provided to effect the copious\ncross-referencing in the electrical and electronic fields, as well as in the mechani\ncal fields, necessary for the employment of computers in the task of searching, is\na real question. An inventor who files an application for a new vacuum tube, for\nexample, might find anticipation of his tube tucked away in a prior patent for a\nradio-receiver circuit, in which prior patent the very same tube might have been\nshown incidentally, but not claimed as part of the invention. The disclosure of\nthe earlier tube would, however, be a bar to patenting the new one. Unless the\ninformation was entered into the computer that this tube construction was dis\nclosed, though not claimed, in the radio-receiver patent, it will not be furnished\nby the computer. Today, however, an examiner, in scanning a patent, can notice\nsuch incidental disclosures not predicted by the title or normal classifications of\nthe patent.\nThere is, accordingly, the stupendous problem of cross-referencing the minu\ntiae and classifying every tiny component of all the combinations shown and de\nscribed in patents, if computer searching is to be successful. This is something\nthat, to some of us, looks quite impractical as yet. Classifying certain kinds of\nchemical compounds may be something else again.\nIn 1935, only 31,900 applications still awaited preliminary or further action\nby the examiners, i.e., were \"pending.\" Recently, there were almost a quarter of\na million of them 2 . And there are pending before the Board of Appeals about\n6,000 cases, and some hearings have been set for more than a year after the\nappeal was entered.\nThe problem of speeding up the granting of patents, consistent with reason\nably thorough examination and consideration, and particularly in the light of\n2Senate Report No. 1430, Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, 86th Congress, 2d\nSession (1958)\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nlimited budget and personnel, is thus still with us, though great strides have\nbeen made in keeping the Patent Office more nearly up-to-date.\n2.3\nReview of Patent Office Decisions\nSuppose the Board of Appeals concurs with the examiner that an application\ndiscloses no patentable invention, and thus decides adversely to the applicant.\nCongress has provided two alternative remedies in the nature of court review of\nsuch decision 3 .\nOne is to file a suit against the commissioner of patents in the Federal\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia 4 . The complainant may ask the\njudge to review the adverse decision of the Board of Appeals, to hear the case\nfor patentability of the invention afresh (a so-called action de novo), and to\nconsider new and more detailed evidence as to the invention underlying the\napplication and the reasons why the patent should be awarded. The District\nCourt judge will either sustain the Patent Office rejection of the application\nor, if he disagrees with the Board of Appeals, direct that a patent be issued.\nAt this trial, the commissioner is represented by his own solicitor, who cross-\nexamines the applicant's witnesses and may present witnesses on behalf of the\ncommissioner.\nFrom an adverse decision of the District Court, one may appeal to the Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A final review by way of an\nappeal petition termed \"certiorari\" may be asked of the United States Supreme\nCourt if the Court of Appeals refuses to reverse the Patent Office; but the\nSupreme Court is not apt presently to grant patents.\nIf, on the other hand, the applicant does not wish to go into Federal District\nCourt, and is well satisfied with the evidence existing in the record of the prose\ncution of the application in the Patent Office, he can alternatively appeal to the\nCourt of Customs and Patent Appeals, strictly upon that record 5 . This court\nwas originally a so-called legislative court, set up under the provisions of Article\nI of the Constitution to serve as a tribunal of Congress, as distinguished from\nthe judicial courts of Article III, such as the Federal District Courts, Courts of\nAppeals, and the Supreme Court. Congress has recently, however, converted\nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals into a judicial court established un\nder Article III. Five judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals hear\nappeals both from customs decisions and from patent decisions. In the past,\nthese judges have not been technically trained people, though recently patent\nlawyers have been considered for the bench and appointed to it, and the Court\nis looking more and more to them with regard to appeals from the Patent Office.\nIf the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Customs\nand Patent Appeals, he has the opportunity of petitioning for certiorari to the\nUnited States Supreme Court; but, within recent years, such petitions have not\nbeen granted.\nSimilarly, when dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of\n3The same remedies apply to trademarks and design patent cases also\n435 U.S.C. 145\n535 U.S.C. 141\n\nCreate or Perish\nPatent Interferences, the losing party may appeal to the Court of Customs and\nPatent Appeals, or may bring a suit in an appropriate District Court to have\nthe Patent Office decision reversed, offering fresh testimony and evidence.\n2.4\nThe Present Mood of the Courts\nThe courts of the District of Columbia are called upon, at times, to review not\nonly the decisions of the Patent Office, but also the actions of nearly every federal\nadministrative officer or tribunal. The Federal Communications Commission\nwill award a radio station to party A rather than to party B; or the Secretary of\nthe Interior will issue a land grant or a mineral lease to one party rather than to\nanother; or the Secretary of State will deny the issuance of a passport; or some\nemployee of the Army considers that he has lost his position unjustly. Persons\ndissatisfied with many administrative decisions come to the various courts of\nthe District of Columbia each year. It is, of course, asking too much of a judge\nthat he be skilled in the technical intricacies of all the matters handled by the\nvarious administrative agencies which, indeed, are presumably staffed by experts\ntrained in the pertinent technical subject matters. Accordingly, the judge does\nnot undertake in such cases to substitute his own fact finding for that of the\nadministrative agency, except under rare circumstances. The courts have held\nvery wisely that unless there is abuse by the administrative agency, unless the\nparties had not been given a fair hearing, unless there is no substantial evidence\nto support the agency's decision, or unless that decision is unconscionable and\nclearly erroneous, a court will not upset the administrative agency's findings\neven though, considering all the evidence, it might itself have decided the fact\nissues differently. A court will of course, maintain its important function of\ninterpreting the law issues, and will readily substitute its interpretation of the\nlaw for that of the agency.\nSuits against the commissioner of patents in the District Court for the Dis\ntrict of Columbia are upon a little different footing, since the statute permits\nthe District Court to receive new evidence not before the Patent Office nor con\nsidered by it and to make a decision based upon all the facts presented. During\nthe relatively recent past, however, the Patent Office has been sustained in case\nafter case by the District Court, apparently no matter what new evidence was\noffered 6 .\nSubsequent to the recent Patent Act of 1952 , which was intended to ex\nercise a stabilizing effect upon court treatment of patents, there have been a\nnumber of reversals of the Patent Office. Some judges of the Court of Appeals\nof the District of Columbia, however, are apparently still hostile, as indicated\nby dissenting Judge Danaher 7:\nThe philosophy permeating the majority opinion basically is one\n6Attention is invited to the anomaly (unless one recognizes the hostility to patents) of the\ncourt's giving such great weight to the Patent Office findings of no invention when it has\ndeclined to grant a patent, and such little weight to its findings of invention and the resulting\nstatutory presumption of validity in suits for infringement of patents granted by it\n7Watson v. Bersworth, 727 O.G. 445, 251 F. 2d 898.\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nof nullification of the remedy provided by Congress, a result hear\nreached (1) by according to the Patent Office the equivalent of a\nconclusive presumption of correctness; and (2) by holding that suffi\nciently of disclosure raises a question of law. Relegated to zero status\nis the District Court, with its finding, its conclusions, its memoran\ndum opinion and its judgment. Judge Wilkin heard many witnesses,\nhad the benefit of charts and exhibits, received detailed explanations\nas to the points in issue and possessed the advantage of colloquy with\nthe opposing counsel. The record discloses close and careful atten\ntion to the many aspects of the case brought under 35 U.S.C. 145\nwhich permits a dissatisfied applicant to pursue his remedy in the\nDistrict Court with may adjudge the applicant entitled to receive a\npatent \"as the facts of the case may appear.\"\nWe recently pointed out that under governing case law and the Fed\neral Rules, even as to patent cases, \"a finding of fact by the District\nCourt, sitting without jury, may be set aside on appeal only if it is\nclearly erroneous.\" We noted that in such situations we are bound to\ninquire whether the District Court's findings are clearly erroneous.\nHere, no effort is made by the majority to demonstrate that Judge\nWilkin's findings are \"clearly wrong\" or \"clearly erroneous.\" They\nare simply are peremptorily spurned as meaningless and nugatory in\nthe context of the majority's treatment of the problem. I shall later\nundertake to show that the District Judge, with thorough conviction,\narrived at his amply supported findings on the new evidence before\nhim. I fail to see how we could have otherwise than he did.\nAnd, more recently, Judge Burger of the Court of Appeals for the District\nof Columbia stated that, while he was \"compelled\" to follow the \"present state\nof the decisions\" in sustaining the Patent Office holding of no invention, he felt\nthat those decisions\nimpose barriers to patents far more stringent than contemplated\neither in the first instance by the Constitution or later by Congress\n8 .\nJudge Burger continued,\nThis case illustrates, to me, the inhospitable attitude toward patents.\nstemming in part from our natural aversion to monopolies. From\nthe premise that monopolies are bad, it is argued that patents being\nmonopolies are at least suspect. But a patent is a monopoly primar\nily in a technical dictionary sense, much as is ownership of land, and\nwe ought not let our reason be clouded by semantics.\nThis lack of hospitality toward patents is suggested in the argument,\nsometimes made here by counsel for the Patent Office, that Buck\n8Boehringer Sohn v. Watson, 256 F. 2d 712, 714.\n\nCreate or Perish\nRogers comic strips which depict rockets, jets, and the space age\nwill no doubt operate and be cited as \"anticipation\" of some patent\napplications for such devices as the fertile brain of the cartoonist de\npicts for the children. It appears that unrestrained imagination, un\nburdened by any responsibility for the hard, patient and painstaking\nwork of development, car bar future patent protection for the men\nand women who actually implement and carry out the prediction\nand prophecies of the Buck Rogers comic strips and the \"Fantastic\nStories\" of the paperback trade. Indeed, Patent Office counsel advice\nus that Rube Goldberg cartoons have been used for this same pur\npose. This hardly seems the way to encourage maximum incentive\nfor those engaged in research and invention. This could mean that\nwidespread research and experimentation in these areas might well,\nby economic necessity or default, ultimately become a Government\nmonopoly.\nWe can hope, accordingly, that the remedy in the federal courts, intended by\nCongress to grant relief from improper Patent Office decision, will ultimately be\ninterpreted to have been restored by the Patent Act of 1952 to patent applicants.\n2.5\nThe Reports of Patent Office and Court Decisions\nScientists have their journals describing the latest advances in the various tech\nnological fields. Similarly, lawyers have the reports of the various administrative\nlaw tribunals, such as the Patent Office, and of the courts, containing decisions\nin litigated cases that illustrate the current legal interpretations placed upon the\nvarious statutes and regulations, as well as how various types of factual situa\ntions are currently treated by such tribunals and courts. From these decisions,\nas thus reported, a lawyer, through the process of analogy, tries to answer a\nclient's questions as to whether or not his invention is patentable, and what his\nlegal rights may be in various situations.\nIn its weekly Official Gazette, the Patent Office publishes, in addition to\nregulations, rules, notices, and reports of interesting Patent Office or court de\ncisions, a brief notice of every patent that has been granted during the week.\nThat notice includes a typical drawing from the patent application, where ap\npropriate, and a typical claim, perhaps representative of the scope of the patent\ngrant 9 . Since the \"claims\" set forth the metes and bounds, or limits, of the\nexclusive privilege for which the patent was granted, an attorney, by scanning\nthe Official Gazette, may learn of recent patent grants in the fields with which\nhis clients are concerned, for the purpose both of keeping up to date and of\nlearning of possible conflict with the client's competitors.\nPatents are classified in the Official Gazette as general and mechanical\npatents, chemical patents, and electrical patents. Design patents, also granted\n9The United States Patent Quarterly (U.S.P.Q.) also contains Patent Office and court\ndecisions bearing upon patents, trademarks, copyrights, unfair competition, antitrust matters,\nand the like; and, as later discussed, federal court decisions on all subjects, including patents,\nare also contained in other reports\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nby the Patent Office for new and ornamental esthetic designs of various kinds\nof items, are also reported.\nIn addition, the Official Gazette publishes trademarks that the Patent Office\nproposes to register, to enable anyone who considers that such registration may\nhurt him to file an opposition to it. A trademark is a mark (such as a symbol\nor word or the like) that a party in business adopts and uses in connection with\nhis products or services. It serves to associate these products or services, in\nthe public mind, with the business entity that is the source or their origin -\n\"Ivory,\" for example, as used on soap by Procter and Gamble. Unlike a patent,\na common-law trademark is not obtained by registering it in the Patent Office,\nbut merely by adopting and using it. However, federal registration of a mark,\nused in interstate commerce, provides, among other benefits, certain procedural\nadvantages in enforcing the mark against infringers, and in obtaining trademark\nregistrations in certain foreign countries.\nI have dwelt briefly on this matter because there is today, in some quarters,\nrenewed interest in the proposal that the Patent Office similarly publish in its\nGazette, for opposition, its intention to grant patents. The theory is that if\nthe public can oppose the granting of a patent by calling to the attention of the\nexaminer some reasons why it should not be issued - such as a prior art that the\nexaminer may have overlooked - the courts should give more than lip service to\nthe present statutory presumption of the validity of a patent grant, discussed\nlater, because the public had its chance to disprove the allegation of invention\nbefore the patent was issued.\nIn Chapter 6, I shall analyze a series of proposals for remedial legislation,\nincluding the matter of oppositions, which, for reasons later presented, I now\nbelieve more likely to be detrimental than helpful to the American patent sys\ntem.\n2.6\nA Further Role of the Courts - Infringement Suits\nLet us assume that a patent has been granted by the Patent Office. This office\nthen loses jurisdiction of the patent, with a few minor exceptions. The next\ntribunal before which a patent may come is the federal District Court. How\ndoes this come about?\nSomebody starts to \"infringe\" the patent. This may mean that someone\nother than the owner or a licensee under the patent makes, uses, or sells (or\ninduces the making, using, or selling of) the invention in violation of the patent\nholder's right to exclude others from manufacturing, using, or selling it. (A\n\"licensee\" is one who has obtained, by suitable contract with the patent holder\nor one authorized to act for him, a license or right to manufacture, use, or\nsell the invention with the assurance that he shall be immune from suit by the\npatent holder.\nUsually some kind of license fee, often termed a royalty and\nfrequently based upon a percentage of the business involving the invention that\nthe licensee may do, is involved in the license contract.)\nWhen the patent holder learns about the action, he demands that the person\ninvolved cease and desist from his infringement and account for past infringe\n\nCreate or Perish\nment or, if the patent holder is prepared to grant him a license, negotiate such\na license.\nSuppose the infringer declines to stop infringing or to negotiate a license. The\npatent then serves, in the words of the late Professor George Washington Pierce\nof Harvard University, as \"a license to bring a law suit.\" The patent holder has\nthe legal right to file a complaint in the federal District Court where the infringer\nresides or where the infringer is both doing business and committing his acts\nof infringement, requesting the court to issue an injunction prohibiting further\ninfringement and to award damages to the patent holder for this unlicensed use\nof his invention.\nThe defendant-infringer must file an answer to the complaint, setting forth\nhis reasons for defying the plaintiff's patent rights. Usually, he will list earlier\nsimilar patents or publications and refer to earlier alleged inventors or users of\nthe invention covered by the patent, in the hope that, at the trial, he will be able\nto convince the court that no real advance had been made over what had been\ndone before, of sufficient scope to warrant a patent grant, and so the Patent\nOffice erred in issuing the patent. The defendant also usually offers reasons\nwhy his product, in view of certain differences in construction, should not be\nconsidered an infringement of the precise invention described and claimed in the\npatent. Other defenses may also be offered.\nI ought to mention, however, another important defense that is sometimes\nappropriate, namely, that the patent holder is misusing his patent in violation\nof our antitrust laws (including restraining or conspiring to restrain trade) 10 .\nHe may have required certain illegal restrictions, such as forcing the licensee to\npurchase unpatented items for him, a restriction outside the scope of the actual\nlegal right, privilege, or \"monopoly\" (using the latter term in a loose sense)\nafforded by the patent grant.\nThe defendant also customarily attacks the patent by way of a counterclaim,\nupon the same grounds used in defending a suit for infringement. He asks the\ncourt to issue a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid or otherwise\nunenforceable, or that the defendant's products are not infringements. In this\nway, should the plaintiff withdraw his suit, the defendant's counterclaim will\nstill be before the court for adjudication.\nThe complain, the answer, and the counterclaim are the customary docu\nments filed in the ordinary run-of-the-mill patent suit.\nBy the time the case comes to trial, the judge has usually required the\ndefendant to narrow down the list of allegedly prior art patents, publications,\nand uses that he is going to rely upon as anticipatory of the invention. At the\nsame time, the judge has required the plaintiff to state the dates of invention\nwhich he is trying to prove, and the particular claims on which he rests his case.\nThe judge then hears the case.\nThe plaintiff, usually with the aid of a\ntechnical expert, such as an engineer or scientist familiar with the field of the\ninvention, explains to the court what the patent covers, translating engineer\ning and technical terms and concepts into layman's language. He explains the\n10Such as the Clayton and Sherman Acts.\n\nThe Role of the Patent Office and the Courts\nproblem that this invention is supposed to solve, and then offers evidence as\nto what the defendant is doing and why this constitutes infringement of the\npatent claims. The plaintiff then rests his case. Why? Because our law says\nthat a patent is presumed to be valid; that is, the process of examination in the\nPatent Office has given the patent an aura of being valid under the law. This\nmeans that the defendant has the burden of proving that the patent is not valid.\nAnd here the law, at least in theory, imposes upon the defendant a very heavy\nburden. The plaintiff has presented what is termed a prima-facie case, and it\nis incumbent upon the defendant to proceed with his proofs. However, in the\nevent that the defendant overcomes, by his evidence, the plaintiff's prima facie\ncase, the ultimate burden of proof of validity rests with the plaintiff.\nThe defendant may call his technical expert to the stand to explain the dis\nclosures of the prior patents or publications (and also prior uses) before referred\nto, trying to convince the judge that the invention was either previously dis\nclosed or publicly used, or that, contrary to the patent examiner's view, any\nindividual skilled in the art (as distinguished from an expert) would know how\nto make this invention. The plaintiff may, of course, cross-examine the defen\ndant's witnesses. When the defendant has completed his defense, the plaintiff\nhas an opportunity to rebut.\nThe judge must then make a decision.\nHe studies the subsequently filed\nbriefs of the parties and the transcript of the testimony, makes up his mind,\nand writes a decision. The federal rules of civil procedure require that he make\nspecific findings of fact and conclusions of law, with regard to the validity and\ninfringement of the patent. He must present his findings in writing.\nThese patent decisions and other decisions in all fields of the federal District\nCourts are reported in a series of volumes known as the Federal Supplement,\nwhich is abbreviated as \"F. Supp.,\" with the volume number as a prefix and\nthe page number as a suffix.\nThe trial judge's decision, however, is not final. He is but the first rung of\nan echelon. The losing party has a right to appeal from his decision to a Circuit\nCourt of Appeals. A circuit is a geographic area generally comprising a few\nstates. The First Circuit, for example, is composed of Massachusetts, Maine,\nNew Hampshire, Rhode Island, and the possession of Puerto Rico. The Court\nof Appeals for the First Circuit sits in Boston, and hears appeals from all of\nthe federal District Courts in its circuit. In all, there are ten circuits plus the\nDistrict of Columbia.\nThe Courts of Appeals customarily sit in panels of three judges, and review\nthe District Courts' decisions, sustaining the trial judges or reversing them, as\nthe case may be. The decisions of the Courts of Appeals are reported in the\nFederal Reporter, abbreviated \"F.,\" for a first series of volumes, and \"F. 2d\" for\nthe present second series.\nSitting above these Courts of Appeals is the Unites States Supreme Court.\nA party losing a patent appeal in a Court of Appeals does not have an absolute\nright to heard by the United States Supreme Court. Under Article III of the\nConstitution, the Supreme Court must, in theory, take certain kinds of cases,\nbut these do not include patent appeals.\nThe losing party must, according,\n\nCreate or Perish\npetition the Supreme Court by way of the before-mentioned petition for a writ\nof certiorari, asking the Court, in its discretion, to review the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals.\nThe Supreme Court grants very, very few such writs. It is more likely to\ngrant certiorari in a vitally important case involving large companies than in\nthe case of smaller companies, or individual litigants, even though the issues\nmay be the same.\nRecent past experience has been that when a Court of Appeals sustained\na patent, there was likelihood that the Supreme Court would grant certiorari,\nand then proceed to destroy the patent. Where a Court of Appeals has thrown\nout the patent, however, there is no case in modern times of which I am aware\nwhere the Supreme Court granted certiorari to reinstate it.\nThe decisions of the Supreme Court are reported in several different volumes,\none of which is the United States Reports, abbreviated as \"U.S.\" I shall, for\ninstance, later refer to the Bell Telephone Cases, which are reported at 126 U.S.\nAnyone desiring to find the decisions of trial and appellate courts, accord\ningly, may consult the Federal Supplement, Federal Reporter, and United States\ndecisions (or, in the case of patents and related fields, the United States Patent\nQuarterly), and he will find there exactly what reasons were advanced by the\nvarious courts for sustaining or destroying patents.\nWith the aid of these reported past decisions, a lawyer can try to instruct\nhis client as to the expression and application of the law by the courts, and so\nmap out a procedure to meet his client's situation."

This chapter accordingly concludes with a discussion of\nthis vital question which the Supreme Court has thus far refused to\nhear. Here are presented the author's views based, in part, upon\nthe current very real role played in American innovation by the in\ndependent inventor.\nThere must, clearly, be a set of rules or norms by means of which to establish\nthe various kinds of invention (using that word in its popular sense for the\nmoment) that may be patentable or, at least, the circumstances under which\npublic policy requires that a patent may not be granted.\nAs noted earlier, Congress set forth, in the Patent Act of 1952, a codifica\ntion of our patent laws, restating the substance of prior statutes and adopting\nconstructive court-made law established prior to the 1930's. But, in addition,\nit introduced changes in the law primarily directed at curbing the damage to\nthe patent system effected by recent destructive policies of the Supreme Court.\nIncluded in these curbs are the abolition of the doctrine of \"flash of genius 1\"\nas the test for invention, later discussed, and the loose and ready invalidation\nof patent claims as defining the invention functionally, instead of structurally.\n3.1\nClasses of Patentable Invention\nThe 1952 Act was passed pursuant to the previously discussed Constitutional\nprovision in Article I, Section 8, empowering Congress to promote the progress of\nuseful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their\ndiscoveries. Two words are used here: \"inventors\" and \"discoveries.\" While\ninvention and discovery may involve different concepts to the linguist, in patent\nlaw, they had previously meant the same thing and been used synonymously.\nThe first provision of the 1952 Act, Section 100, thus sets forth that \"the term\n1Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., 214 U.S. 84, 91 (1941)\n\nCreate or Perish\n'invention' means invention or discovery.\" As explained before, the word \"dis\ncovery\" does not include the bald discovery of a scientific principle, and the\ndefinition in Section 100 appears to limit the word to mean only \"invention,\"\nas that term had been used in prior court decisions.\nThe statute then proceeds to define various classes of invention - listing a\nprocess, a machine, a manufacture, a composition of matter, or a material. Some\nof these words are a little bit out-of-date today, but they came from the very\nearly patent acts when the only appropriate term to describe an invention was a\n\"machine\" or a \"manufacture.\" In our modern vernacular, a \"machine\" is hardly\ndescriptive of an electronic component or circuit; but the courts, following the\nlead of prior Supreme Courts and the actual desires and intentions of Congress,\ncontinue to use this older language of the statutes. Thus, a piece of apparatus\nthat achieves a useful result functionally is a \"machine,\" and an item that can\nbe produced or manufactured by a machine is an article \"manufacture.\" As an\nillustration, apparatus for weaving cloth is a \"machine;\" the cloth, when woven,\nis a \"manufacture.\"\nThe term \"composition of matter\" is self-explanatory. If someone invents a\nnew chemical compound, that compound may be patentable. If someone else\nmerely discovers a chemical compound or element existing in nature, that is not\npatentable. Thus a claim to an electric lamp filament wire formed of ductile\ntungsten was invalidated 2 . The General Electric Company inventor, W. D.\nCoolidge, had made an important advance in a ductile-tungsten filament for\nlamps. He had accomplished this by removing impurities from tungsten as found\nin nature; but removing impurities from natural tungsten to make it ductile\nresulted only in pure tungsten, which is inherently ductile. Pure tungsten, of\ncourse, is a natural element, even if it never found pure in nature. It is interesting\nto note that the judge who invalidated this patent (Judge Morris of the District\nCourt for the District of Delaware) had himself previously sustained the patent.\nHe had not then, however, been presented with the argument that the patent\ncovered merely an element of nature in its pure state; but when so informed,\nreasoned that it could not be the subject of a \"monopoly,\" even though never\nfound pure in nature. An element is not included in the statutory classes of\ninvention.\n\"Material\" is a new word in the statute and may have a meaning very similar\nto that of \"manufacture,\" though a \"material\" may be produced by a process\nthat would not, in conventional language, necessarily be termed \"manufactur\ning.\"\n\"Process\" is defined, in part, as a \"process, art, or method.\"\nIt usually\nembraces a series of steps for accomplishing or producing a certain result. A\nchemical process is, of course, quite easy to comprehend. The next chapter,\nwhich discusses the Bell Telephone Cases, will show that there may also be an\nelectrical process.\nSuppose someone arranges the various parts of an old machine in a novel\nmanner to perform a new operation. Is this a process or method? A case of this\n2General Electric Co. v DeForest Radio Co., 28 F 2d 641.\n\nThe Patent Law\nsort came before the United States Supreme Court in connection with adjusting\nan existing metal-perforating machine so that, instead of merely perforating\nthe metal, the dies lifted the perforations out and twisted them to enlarge the\nperforations, thereby making an expanded metal sheet 3 . The defendant argued\nthat this was not within the patentable classes of invention since the original\n\"machine\" with its dies was old and thus was not patentable, and, additionally,\nthe ultimate \"manufacture\" - the expanded metal - was an old article. By this\nreasoning the inventor had not produced a new machine, a new manufacture,\nor, obviously, a new composition of matter. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court\nheld that this invention involved a new process, although, on several occasions,\nthat Court had previously intimated, by dicta, that there could not be a novel\npatentable process or method unless it involved chemical, electrical, or other\n\"elemental\" phenomena. This case, however, decided that a patentable process,\nart, or method could also involve mechanical manipulative steps: it could be a\nnew way of operating an old machine to obtain new results.\nIn addition to the definition of the term \"process\" as meaning \"process, art,\nor method,\" the Patent Act of 1952 also provides that \"process\" shall include\nA new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition\nof matter, or material.\nTo appreciate the significance of this definition, let us recall the case of Dr.\nWilliam Morton, a Boston dentist, who is credited, in some quarters, with hav\ning been the first to make the discovery, and the use of ether was immediately\nadopted. The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary and a number of other hospi\ntals, indeed, freely infringed upon Dr. Morton's patent. Suit was entered which\nfreely infringed upon Dr. Morton's patent. Suit was entered for infringement 4 ,\nand the court found that Dr. Morton \"was entitled to be classified among the\ngreatest benefactors of mankind.\" But, the court questioned, was the claimed\ninvention a new process? No, there was no new series of steps involved. Re\nsearchers had previously inhaled ether. (Question: Had they previously inhaled\nit to the extent taught by Morton to produce the new effect of anesthesia?) Dr.\nMorton was claiming the use of ether for the purpose of anesthetization. That\nis not, said the court, a new \"art\" or \"process.\" Was it a new composition of\nmatter? Ether had been discovered before. Was it a new machine? No. Was it a\nnew manufacture? No. The court concluded, therefore, that this epoch-making\ndiscovery was not one included in the limited classes that Congress defined as\namong those patentable. So Dr. Morton's patent was thrown out.\nA discovery may be brilliant and useful, and not patentable. . . . Something\nmore is necessary. The new force or principle brought to light must\nbe embodied and set to work, and can be patented only in connection\nor combination with the means by which, or the medium through\nwhich it operates.\n3Expanded Metal Co. v. Bradford. 214 U.S. 366 (1909).\n4Morton v. New York Eye Infirmary, 17 Fed. Cas. 879, 5 Blatchf. 116 (1862)\n\nCreate or Perish\nTo cite another illustration: the citrus fruit industry had long been troubled\nwith a blue mold that formed upon citrus fruit shipped from the South.\nIt\nwas discovered that if oranges were coated with a solution of borax, specks or\ncuts in the fruit became thoroughly covered over and no formation of the mold\nwould take place. A patent was applied for and obtained by the Brogdex Co.\ncovering the product and the process for making it. It was claimed that fresh\ncitrus fruit of which the rind of skin carried borax in a very small amount is\nrendered resistant to blue mold. The American Fruit Growers infringed this\npatent and Brogdex brought suit. The district court and the court of appeals\nheld the patent valid and infringed. The Supreme Court, however, held that this\ninvention was neither a machine nor a composition of matter 5 . It was also not\nan article of manufacture, because there was no change in form or appearance of\nthe fruit (much as Coolidge still only produced tungsten). In other words, it did\nnot belong to any of the patentable classes and could not, therefore, be protected\nby patent. As for claiming the discovery in method form, the Supreme Court\nheld that the use of borax had been known before, not for filling up small specks\nto prevent blue mold, but for preserving fruit, and the method of applying the\nborax was the same as used here (much as Dr. Morton's method of applying\nether to the nostrils was allegedly old). One could not the obtain a patent for\na new use of an old method.\nLet us assume, by way of contrast, that in the process of treating the orange\nwith borax some chemical reaction took place so that the orange was no longer\nan orange, and the borax was no longer borax. We would then have a new\ncomposition of matter - neither orange nor borax. Would this be patentable?\nA similar case occurred where it had been found that, in dyeing fur to preserve\nit, a chemical reaction took place which actually made a new preserved fiber out\nof the natural hair. It no longer had the characteristics of the natural fur. It\nno longer had the characteristics of the natural fur. Under these circumstances,\nsaid the circuit court of appeals 6, the invention was a new article of manufacture\nand hence within the patentable classes of invention.\nOne can see, accordingly, that there is room for great latitude and inge\nnuity of argument in trying to construe a discovery as being within one of the\npatentable classes. A hostile court will not permit the law to grow with scientific\ndiscovery, whereas a court with a zeal to protect property rights in discoveries\n(under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution) can offer great encouragement\nto the promotion of progress in the useful arts.\nWe can all probably understand why Congress has not seen fit to permit\npatents to be granted for mere scientific discoveries. Something is wrong, how\never, if a practical application of such a discovery cannot be construed as being\nwithin the patentable classes of invention set forth by the Congress for that very\npurpose. Dr. Morton, for example, did not try to patent ether all over again;\nhe tried to patent its use for a particular new result. Should not that take it\nout of the category of pure scientific discovery? Congress, the engineering, sci\n5American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co., 283 U.S. 1.\n6Steinfur Patents Corp. v. William Beyer, Inc., 62 F 2d 238.\n\nThe Patent Law\nentific, and business people, and the lawyers who were responsible for the 1952\nPatent Act appear to have answered this question in the affirmative by defin\ning \"process\" to include \"a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or material.\" While the paucity of court decisions makes\nit too early to form an opinion as to the ultimate effect of this new definition,\nthe Board of Appeals of the Patent Office has already construed it to mean that\nthe new use must be one not analogous to, but radically different from, the kind\nbefore involved, and that the patent claim must be couched in the form of a\nprocess or method and not of an apparatus.\n3.2\nConditions of Patentability\nTurning, now, to the definition in the statute of patentable invention, we find\nthat Section 101 is limited to \"Whoever invents or discovers.\"\nThis means\nan individual or individuals, since a corporate body or other organizational\nentity cannot itself invent or discover. The individuals who do this creating and\nthis inventing may, however, assign their patent rights or a portion thereof, in\nwriting, to a corporation or to the government, so that a patent or a part thereof\nmay actually be owned by others than the inventor. But the application must\nbe filed in the name of the first inventor or inventors. The language provides\nthat, in this country, a patent can be issued only to the first inventor. In Great\nBritain, patents were and are granted to anyone who brings a new invention\ninto the country. The British philosophy encourages the importation as well as\ninvention of new techniques. Not so in this country, however, for if a patent\nshould be granted to someone other than a first inventor, it will be thrown out\nby the court as invalid.\nContinuing with Section 101, the inventor must invent or discover a \"new and\nuseful\" invention. The matter of the requirement for novelty has previously been\ndiscussed. As for the word \"useful,\" nearly everything has been held to be useful.\nAmong the exceptions are devices for promoting fraud or that are injurious to\nthe public health or against public policy. A \"perpetual-motion\" machine or\nany other inoperative proposal lacks utility. There are then set forth the before\nmentioned five classes of patentable invention: \"process, machine, manufacture,\nor composition of matter\" or \"material\"; and, in addition, \"any new and useful\nimprovement thereof.\" Not everyone can make a basic invention, but the law\nentitles one to seek a patent for an improvement in a machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or process.\nSection 101 also states that one may obtain a patent in the above classes,\nsubject to the requirements given in Section 102, which sets out the \"Condi\ntions for patentability, novelty and loss of right to patent.\" The Congress has\npositively declared that \"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless. . . .\" This\nappears to have been an effort (not yet successful) to curb the indiscriminate\ninvalidation of patents.\nThe first restriction is that a patent cannot be granted if the invention was\nknown or used by others in this country or patented or described in a printed\npublication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the\n\nCreate or Perish\napplicant for a patent (Section 102 [a]).\nThe inventor does not have to be\nactually aware of such prior knowledge, use, publication, or patenting, for, if\nthe invention was \"described in a printed publication\" or a prior patent was\nissued anywhere at all before he made his invention there would be an absolute\nbar to granting him a patent.\nEven if the prior patentee did not claim the\nsame inventive features, but merely \"described\" the invention adequately in a\npatent issued prior to the present inventor's concept, this description becomes\na statutory bar. This restriction demonstrates the importance of patent and\nliterature searches of both United States and foreign patents and publications\nbefore filing a patent application.\nAs for the phrase \"known or used by others in this country,\" a little history\nis in order. This was not always the law. The early patent statutes set up as\na bar to patentability knowledge or use anywhere in the world. Realizing the\nimportance of encouraging the utilization of new concepts in this country, how\never, Congress revised this to cover only prior knowledge or use in this country\n- a sore point in our current relations with foreign countries. If the invention\nwas known or used abroad but was not patented or described in a printed pub\nlication before the invention was made here, no bar exists to obtaining a patent\nin this country, provided that the inventor did not know of this knowledge or\nuse abroad. Of course, if he did know, he did not make the invention.\nThe courts have interpreted the word \"known,\" moreover, in a very strict\nsense to mean that \"an invention . . . has been completed by reduction to prac\ntice 7.\" The invention is not \"known\" if it is a prior \"conception only\" (such as\na laboratory notebook drawing or disclosure, or an unpublished manuscript), or\nif \"prior machines\" have not \"been working machines\" but \"mere experiments.\"\nEven the knowledge by individuals in this country, prior to an inventor's inven\ntion here, that a certain device had been previously used abroad successfully, is\nnot with the statutory term \"known 8.\"\nThe term \"used\" is similarly the subject matter of much court construction.\nBriefly, it means a public use 9 and not an experimental or secret use, and does\nnot include mere conceptions or abandoned experiments, such as those made\nin company laboratories or in institutions of learning and not followed up by\npublication, reduction to practice, actual public use, or patenting.\nAll of this has to do with knowledge, use, patenting, or publishing (Section\n102 [a]) before one makes an invention. There is also a time limitation. If an\napplicant waits too long, even though there is no prohibition under Section 102\n(a), he may be out of luck in view of the restriction of Section 102 (b), which\nprovides that a person shall be entitled to a patent.\nunless the invention was patented or described in a printed publica\ntion in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this\ncountry, more than one year prior to the date of the application for\n7Application of Schittler, CCPA, 234 F 2d 882, 887.\n8Doyle v. Spaulding, C.C. 19 F. 744; Westinghouse Machine Co. v. General Electric Co.,\n2 Cir., 207 F. 75, City of Milwaukee v. Activated Sludge, Inc., 7 Cir., 69 F. 2d 577.\n9Paddies, Inc. v. Broadway Dept. Stores, 147 F. Supp 373.\n\nThe Patent Law\npatent in the United States.\nEven though he may be qualified under Section 102 (a), therefore, if he does\nnot file the patent application until more than a year after publishing a thesis\nor scientific paper on the invention, he is too late to obtain a patent. If, before\nfiling, he waits more than a year after someone else has described his invention\nin a publication, again it is too late to obtain a patent. And the same is true\nif he files more than a year after his invention first went into public use or was\nput on sale.\nIn some foreign countries, it is too late to file for a patent after any docu\nment describing the invention has been made public in the country in question;\nthis is the case, for example, in Great Britain. In Germany, a description of\nthe invention in public print in any language or country, before the German\napplication is filed, bars a German patent. It is not entirely safe, therefore, to\ndelay filing until after publication to obtain foreign patent protection.\nThe last-named restrictions of Section 102 (b) in connection with \"public\nuse\" or \"sale\" are very important to the applied scientist or engineer. His new\nproducts are always going out for tests, for sale, for use; and the question arises\nas to when he should file a patent application. Perhaps one of those fundamental\ncases that partially answered this question arose in Boston in the late nineteenth\ncentury in connection with the invention of wooden paving blocks. The patent\nwas not applied for until several years after these blocks had been in use in a toll\nroad. The defendant infringed that patent, contending that it was invalid since\nthe blocks had been in public use on the street more than two years before the\ninventor had filed his patent application. (At that time, the statute provided for\ntwo years of public use instead of one year, as at present.) The Supreme Court\nfound 10 that there was no way of proving the efficacy of this invention except\nby actual test on a street, and the circumstances showed that the inventor was\nmerely trying to test whether or not the invention was any good. The Court,\naccordingly, construed this, not as a \"public use,\" but rather as an experimental\none.\nAlong came the case of a gentleman who invented steel stays for women's\ncorsets, in place of whalebone as before. He gave a sample to a lady friend\nto try out, and she used it for several years. Then the inventor filed for his\npatent. When the case reached the court, the defendant set up as a \"public\nuse\" argument the the fact that this corset had been worn for more than two\nyears before the inventor filed his patent application. The inventor, on the other\nhand, argued according to the rule of the paving-block cased before mentioned.\nThe court thereupon laid down a second important rule 11, namely, that even a\nsingle use by a member of the public, except under such restrictions or conditions\nas would clearly delineate experimental or confidential use, constitutes a bar to\nthe granting of a patent, unless the application is filed within the statutory\nperiod. And this very rigid rule had been discovered by several companies, with\nimportant patents, much to their sorrow.\n10Elizabeth v. Pavement Co., 1877, 97 U.S. 126, 134-135.\n11Egbert v. Lippman, 104 U.S. 333.\n\nCreate or Perish\nIn a recent case 12, suit was brought for infringement of a patent dealing\nwith a process for casting patterned plastic sheets. The defendant showed that\nmore than a year before the application for patent the plaintiffhad sold several\nhundred plastic sheets made by the patented process. Thereupon, the plaintiff\ninsisted that this use of the patent and sale of the product created by its process\nwere merely experimental to determine the \"production controls\" necessary for\nthe successful commercial exploitation of the patent; but the court held that\nthis constitutes a \"prior use\" within the meaning of the statute.\nThis decision points out significantly the importance of filing a patent ap\nplication not only for the new article, but also for the process involved in the\nmanufacture of the article, within a year after the first sale. The safest proce\ndure is to file before the public obtains the article, and even before it is put on\nsale. The term \"sale,\" moreover, has been interpreted by the courts to include\nan offer for sale. Thus the matter of patent protection, both for the article and\nfor the method of making it, should be very carefully explored well within the\nyear after any offer to sell or any public use.\nReturning to the restrictions in Section 102, we see that part (c) bars a patent\nif the inventor has abandoned his invention. Even if one has produced and tested\nan invention, so as to establish its so-called reduction to practice, but has put\nit away on a shelf and forgotten it, and in the meantime it is independently\ninvented by another person, he cannot prevail as the first inventor against the\nsecond person. Abandonment does not promote the useful arts, and accordingly\nit is not in accordance with our public policy to reward such inactivity. It is\nvery important, therefore, to realize that one cannot put ideas away and forget\nabout them, and then hope to resurrect early dates for them at a later time.\nThose early dates not utilized are of no avail against the diligence of others.\nSection 102 (d) relates to the effect of foreign patent filing. One must file\na separate patent application in each country in which one wishes the inven\ntion protected, though it now appears likely that a single European Economic\nCommunity patent may be established within a very few years, as discussed in\nChapter 7. Under the Universal Copyright Convention 13, a copyright regis\ntration in one country serves also as one in the other foreign countries which\nare members of the convention. Patents, on the other hand, must be obtained\nthrough the individual patent offices of the respective countries. Section 102\n(d) provides that, if one has filed in a foreign country more than twelve months\nbefore filing in this country, and if the patent issues abroad before the filing of\nthe United States application, he is barred from obtaining a patent here.\nThis goes hand in hand, however, with a provision of a different convention\n14, by which one may file abroad in any foreign country that is a member of\n12U.S. Chemical Corporation v. Plastic Glass Corporation, 3 Cir., 243 F. 2d 892 (1957).\n13The United States is a signatory to this 1952 Convention, implemented into our law by\nPublic Law 742, 83d Congress, effective September 16, 1955.\n14Convention of Paris for the Protection of Industrial Property of March 20, 1883, as\namended December 14, 1900 (Brussels); June 2, 1911 (Washington, D.C.); November 6, 1925\n(The Hague); June 2, 1934 (London). A further conference at Lisbon, October 6 - 31, 1958\nresulted in further amendments.\n\nThe Patent Law\nthis other convention, and thereby obtain the effective benefit of the earlier\nfiling date in the United States, provided the foreign filing is done within twelve\nmonths of the United States filing date. Similarly, foreigners may file here with\nreciprocal privileges. There is thus a year's leeway in which to decide whether\nor not to file abroad; and foreign applications claiming the convention benefits,\nif filed with that year, will be treated as if they had been filed simultaneously\nwith the United States application.\nThe United States Government, however, does not permit its citizens to file\nabroad as an absolute right. This is because of national-defense statutes. The\npatent application filed in the Patent Office is examined by Army, Air Force,\nAEC, and other personnel, assisting the commissioner of patents, to see whether\nit contains information which might jeopardize the security of the country. If\nthe answer is in the affirmative, the commissioner will issue a secrecy order,\nprohibiting any filing abroad before obtaining a license from the government to\ndo so. If, under those circumstances, one still wishes to file abroad, he may\npetition the commissioner, offering reasons why secrecy should not be required\nin the particular case. The commissioner will take up the matter with the branch\nof the service which, in the first place, considered that the invention involved\nclassified material and then a decision will be reached as to whether or not to\npermit filing abroad, and in what countries. If, however, after one has filed an\napplication, he does not hear within six months from the Patent Office that\nthe case has been put under secrecy orders, he automatically obtains a license\nto file abroad, except that special permission may be required for Iron Curtain\ncountries.\nSection 102 (e) provides that if an invention has been described in a patent\ngranted to another on an application filed before one has himself independently\nmade the same invention, there is a bar to his obtaining a patent in this country.\nIf the prior patent claims the invention, and if the independent inventor made\nhis invention before the filing date of the application for the prior patent, then\nhe may ask the Patent Office to declare an interference contest between himself\nand the other patentee. In this way, he may have the right to take inter partes\ntestimony for a determination as to who is really the first inventor. If the patent\ndiscloses, but does not claim the invention, however, and again, the independent\ninventor made the invention before the filing date of the application for the prior\npatent, the independent inventor may present ex parte evidence, by means of\naffidavit 15, to demonstrate his earlier date of invention, and thus remove the\nother patent as a bar to the granting of his.\nSection 102 (f) deals with the necessity, previously discussed, for the appli\ncant to be the first inventor.\n3.3\nInterference\nSection 102 (g) provides for interference contests mentioned above to determine\npriority of invention where more than one person is claiming to be the original\ninventor. The statute describes the court-established rule that the first applicant\n15Patent Office Rule of Practice No. 131\n\nCreate or Perish\nto file is not necessarily, in law, the first inventor. The inventor is the first to\nreduce it to practice, but there is one exception to this rule. If, though the last\nto reduce it to practice, he was the first to conceive, and was diligently working\nat it when his rival entered the field and continued to do so until his reduction\nto practice, then he is the first inventor.\nPerhaps a few definitions of interference terminology may be helpful. Con\nception involves obtaining the complete mental picture of the invention, even\ntough one has not yet built it. If one is to rely upon a drawing or a notebook\ndisclosure or the like to prove conception, he must show that all of the elements\nof the claimed invention in controversy are present or implied therein.\nThe\nkeeping of full notes is thus greatly to be desired. Reduction to practice of the\ninvention means either building and successfully testing the invention (though\nthere are some exceptions to this necessity in the case of very simple devices)\nor filing a patent application for a theoretically operative model. Building and\nsuccessful testing is termed \"actual\" reduction to practice, filing a patent appli\ncation may constitute a \"constructive\" reduction to practice. Corroboration by\na qualified witness to the inventor's tests is important, since the courts, in order\nto avoid possible fraud, require such independent corroboration of the inventor's\ntestimony before accepting the latter's alleged dates.\nMany times, however, particularly if an individual with neither money nor\ntime with which to build and test an invention is satisfied with the theoretical\noperativeness of the invention, he may protect his rights by filing a patent\napplication, and thus obtain a constructive reduction to practice. The United\nStates Government currently takes the position, in contracts granted to develop\nor adapt inventions, that, no matter how much money one may have spent in\ndeveloping a conception or in reducing it to practice by filing patent applications\nand the like, if government money in substantial amounts is appropriated to\nbuild the invention for the first time under the contract, the government must\nbe granted a free license, with no strings attached 16 . The government may then,\nwith impunity, give to others than the inventors and developers the business of\nbuilding the invention commercially for it.\nAs a former member of a bar-association committee on government patent\npolicies, I can state that, unfortunately, many lawyers are apathetic in this\nmatter, which puts a particularly onerous burden on the small company. It is\nthe government, however, that suffers in the long run when individual inventors\nand their companies are discouraged from suggesting the creative flashes from\nwhich have sprung the seeds, not only of our weapons of defense and offense,\nbut also of our economic expansion and development.\n3.4\nThe Statutory Test of Invention\nThe court-made law relating to the requirement for the exercise of a \"flash of\ncreative genius,\" in order to support a patent, laid down by Mr. Justice Douglas\n16The Armed Services Procurement Regulations provide an exception in cases where the\nGovernment funds are relatively small and in other similar circumstances.\n\nThe Patent Law\n17, was overthrown by Congress in the last sentence of Section 103 of the Patent\nAct of 1952:\nPatentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the\ninvention was made.\nIt has been superseded by another and entirely different test which assumes\nthat the requirements of Section 102 have been met. It reads:\nA patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically\ndisclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if\nthe differences between the subject matter sought to be patented\nand the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would\nhave been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person\nhaving ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\nPatentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the\ninvention was made.\nThe Supreme Court has, as yet, declined every opportunity offered it to\ninterpret this statutory provision of the ultimate test of whether an improvement\nis or is not sufficiently significant to warrant a patent grant. Since this question\nis the most pressing to every inventor, engineer, or other party concerned with\ninventions, a discussion of the history of this legislation and at least certain\nlower-court views with regard to it may be helpful.\nA \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter per\ntains\" has been the standard set up ever since at least 1850 18 . Unfortunately,\nhowever, that standard has not always been met, but has varied with the differ\nent courts. When one court was desirous of sustaining a patent, one standard\nwas set up. When another court desired to invalidate a patent, the standard\nwas quite different. Matters reached such a state that, as before mentioned, the\nstandard became no longer a \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which\nsaid subject matter pertains\" but rather one inspired by \"the flash of creative\ngenius.\"\nThis \"flash-of-creative-genius\" standard has raised a storm of protest through\nout the country, since in practice it is almost impossible to attain. Such a yard\nstick would have invalidated many of our most important patents, including Eli\nWhitney's cotton gin, McCormick's reaper, the sewing machine, the air brake,\nthe telegraph, the telephone, and the electric lamp. Such invalidation, of course,\nwould have discouraged invention.\nWhether or not this result would have pleased a minority of justices of\nthe Supreme Court, it certainly did not please Congress.\nAnd the reaction\nof Congress, moreover, did not arise out of any solicitude for our large corpora\ntions:\n17Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., U.S. 84, 91 (1941).\n18Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248, 267 (1850).\n\nCreate or Perish\nRather, through the operation of the patent system the small com\npany and the newcomer has been able to gain a foothold without\nbeing subject to appropriation of developments by the larger en\ntrenched firms. Polaroid, Thiokol, Mallory, and many others, rep\nresent small and modest sized businesses which have launched new\nproducts against the competition of an existing industry . . . It should\nnot be assumed that every time an excuse is found to invalidate a\npatent, competition necessarily benefits 19 .\nEven so, Congress had no desire to change the law, but rather to lower the\n\"flash-of-creative-genius\" standard to the level of the \"person having ordinary\nskill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\" Congress itself said so,\nin the Reviser's Note to Section 103:\nThis paragraph is added with the view that an explicit statement in\nthe statute may have some stabilizing effect. . .\nIt is of interest to observe, therefore, that the late Judge Learned Hand\nheld 20 that Section 103 does not actually constitute new legislation, but rather\nrestores the law to what it was \"twenty or thirty years ago\" before the courts\nbegan to adopt the standard of \"the flash of creative genius.\" Some courts have\nfollowed Judge Hand's decisions; others have not.\nCongress seemed convinced that only by such a restoring of the law would\nthe confidence of inventors be re-established and the progress of the useful arts\npromoted. Therefore, it is again studying the problem with the object of en\nacting further legislation.\nA subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary has been hearing testimony and collecting evidence for some years.\nSeveral reports by that subcommittee have expressed dissatisfaction with the\nlarge number of patents still being invalidated by the courts.\nIt may be well here to state that Section 103 had its origin in this very\ndissatisfaction. In the report of the National Patent Planning Commission, 1943,\nheaded by the late Charles F. Kettering, for example, appears the following:\nThe most serious weakness in the present patent system is the lack\nof a uniform test or standard for determining whether the particular\ncontribution of an inventor merits the award of the patent grant.\nThere is an ever-widening gulf between the decisions of the Patent\nOffice in granting patents and decisions of the courts who pass upon\ntheir validity. It would be highly desirable and a great step forward\nif patents could be issued with a greater assurance that their validity\nwould be upheld by the courts. No other feature of our law is more\ndestructive to the purpose of the patent system than this existing\nuncertainty as to the validity of a patent.\n19George E. Front, \"The Patent System and the Modern Economy,\" Senate Subcommittee\non Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, of the Committee on the Judiciary, Study No. 2,\npage 77, 84th Congress, 2d Session (1956).\n20Lyon v. Bauch & Lomb Optical Co., 2 Cir., 224 F. 2d 530 (1955), certiorari denied 350\nU.S. 911, 955.\n\nThe Patent Law\n3.5\nObviousness of \"Subject Matter as a Whole\"\nThe restriction that an invention is not patentable if it is obvious as a whole, and\nnot merely in part, has been in force at least back to Supreme Court decisions\nin the late 1800's 21 .\nThe Century Dictionary gives the following definition of \"obvious\": \"easily\ndiscovered, seen, or understood; plain; manifest; evident; palpable.\" The way\nto determine whether an invention is obvious, accordingly, is by evidence.\nIn patent-infringement suit after patent-infringement suit, the plaintiff has\noffered evidence to show that he was the first to have offered a sought-after\nsolution to an existing problem and that, after disclosure of his solution, the\ndefendant appropriated it. The courts, in sanctioning this appropriation, have\nrarely disagreed with the plaintiffin his showing, but have thrown out his patent\nas involving merely an \"obvious\" step or device.\nBut such reasoning raises\nquestions.\nIf the solution of the problem disclosed by the inventor was obvious, why\ndid not the defendant adopt it earlier? Why did he wait until the invention was\nplaced upon the market by the plaintiff? If the prior-art developments constitute\nsatisfactory solutions of the given problem, as every defendant argues, why do\nnot the defendant use that prior art, instead of spending money in litigation in\norder to obtain the right to use the plaintiff's invention? If, on the other hand,\nthe prior art is not satisfactory, can it really be contended that the plaintiffhas\naccomplished no more in his device than, \"as a whole,' was obvious in the prior\nart?\nBut in case after case the courts have insisted in holding the invention \"obvi\nous\" in the light of hindsight in prior-art knowledge, in the face of indisputable\nshowings that there was no \"person having ordinary skill in the art to which\nsaid subject matter pertains\" to whom the invention was as that time \"obvious.\"\nRecently, a court of appeals sustained a district court's holding 22 that \"I am\nnot so troubled\" about \"Monday-morning-quarterbacking\" as more \"sensitive\njudges\" would have been; \"it does not seem to me to require inventive genius\"\nto make the plaintiff's invention; \"I am unable to perceive invention.\"\nIn an earlier day, a district court judge similarly remarked 23 . \"I am satisfied\nthat is amounts to nothing more than . . . I am unable to see how . . . \"; and the\ncourt of appeals reversed the decision, holding that these statements were not\nfindings of fact, but merely expressions of opinion, with \"no testimony in the\nrecord to support it.\"\nThe statute in Section 103, however, makes it plain that the question to be\ndecided by the court is not what may seem obvious after the event to lay courts\nor even technical experts, but, rather what\n21Bates v. Coe, 98 U.S. 31, 48 (1878), Imhauser v. Buerk, 101 U.S. 647, 660 (1879), Parks\nv. Booth, 102 U.S. 96 (1880).\n22Glagovsky v. Bowcraft, 164 F. Supp. 189, 190, 1 Cir., 267 F. 2d 479 (1969), certiorari\ndenied 361 U.S. 884.\n23Gray v. Eastman Kodak Co., 7 F. Supp. 321, 322, reversed 3 Cir. 67 F. 2d 190, 194\n(1933).\nThough the Supreme Court reversed at 292 U.S. 332 (293 U.S. 628), it was only\nbecause of a defect in appellate procedure.\n\nCreate or Perish\nwould have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a\nperson having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter\npertains.\nThis opinion has been reiterated recently by the Court of Customs and\nPatent Appeals 24:\nWhat amounts to patentable \"invention\" . . . is simply whether the\ndifference between what is claimed and the prior art would have been\nobvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention\nwas made.\nCertainly this does not mean whether the invention may seem obvious to\nthe court through hindsight.\nThe views of the late Judge Parker 25, of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit, may be of interest:\nThe state of the prior art, the problem to which the invention was\naddressed, its success in solving the problem, its acceptance by the\nart, and its success commercially should be accorded more weight\nthan what the judge, who is unfamiliar with the art or with the\nproblems of industry generally, may chance to think, in the light of\nthe problem's solution, as to what one skilled in the art should have\nknown or should have been able to do.\nHe went on:\nAnd especially should the judge be on guard against permitting an\nticipation to be found in the bone yard of abandoned experiments\nand mere paper patents. In such case the searching and conclusive\ninquiry is: \"If what has caused such a great change in the art and\nsuch an improvement in the industry was old and ready at hand,\nwhy did not it occur to someone else to use it?\"\nAs one court of appeals 26 remarked:\nIt is usually, if not indeed always, easy to discover a genesis some\nwhere for any patentee's contribution. But if patents were to be held\ninvalid on such reasoning, few would survive.\nAn invention, moreover, is always \"simple\" and \"obvious\" after it has been\ndisclosed. The Supreme Court of an earlier era said 27:\n24Application of Ruff and Dukeshire, CCPA, 256 F. 2d 590, 598 (1958).\n25\"Recurrence of Fundamentals,\" in American Bar Association Journal, Vol. 30, p. 623\n(1944).\n26S.D. Warren Co. v Nashua Gummed and Coated Paper Co., 1 Cir., 205 F. 2d 602, 605\n(1953).\n27Loom Co. v Higgins, 105 U.S. 580, 591 (1854).\n\nThe Patent Law\nAt this point we are constrained to say that we cannot yield our\nassent to the argument, that the combination of the different parts\nor elements for attaining the object in view was so obvious as to\nmerit no title to invention. Now that it has succeeded, it may seem\nvery plain to any one that he could have done it as well. This is\noften the case with inventions of the greatest merit. It may be laid\ndown as a general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that\nif a new combination and arrangement of known elements produce\na new and beneficial result, never attained before, it is evidence of\ninvention.\nThe invention of the patent in suit in the Barbed Wire Patent case 28 lay in\nwrapping the barb several times around the carrier wire, so that a bearing was\nprovided for the barb, which was thus held permanently at right angles to the\ncarrier wire. The prior art disclosed the same barb, but without the bearing,\nso that it wobbled about the carrier wire instead of being held rigidly at right\nangles.\nThe Supreme Court remarked that \"it may be strange\" that this simple\ndevice was not \"obvious.\" Yet, \"simple\" and \"obvious\" as this improvement\nappeared in retrospect, it laid a foundation for accomplishing something that\nthe prior art could not do. By the new barbed-wired invention, cattle could be\nkept within their wired enclosures.\nA short time later 29, in sustaining a patent, the Supreme Court spoke of\nan invention that \"appears to the ordinary mind so simple as to excite wonder\nthat it was not thought of before.\" And, still later 30:\nIts simplicity should not blind us as to its character. Many things,\nand the patent laws abounds in illustrations, seem obvious after they\nhave been done. . . . Knowledge after the event is always easy, and\nproblems once solved present no difficulties.\nThe invention involved in the Eibel Process case 31, in retrospect, was again\n\"simple\" and \"obvious.\" It merely raised slightly the rear end of the belt of the\nFourdrinier papermaking machine, in order the the liquid pulp traveling thereon\ncould move a little faster, by gravity. Small as the advance was, however, it was\npromptly adopted by the industry.\nAgain, the invention in the Ray-O-Vac case of the early 1940's 32 was \"a\nvery narrow one in a crowded art.\" It consisted of enclosing a flashlight battery\nin a steel casing to render it leakproof. But this idea had never occurred (and\nhence manifestly was not obvious) to those persons (other than the inventor)\n\"having ordinary skill in the art\" who had long been troubled with the battery\nleakage.\n28143 U.S. 275, 283 (1892).\n29Potts v. Creager, 155 U.S. 597, 608 (1895).\n30Diamond Rubber Co. of N.Y. v. Consolidated Rubber Tire Co., 220 U.S. 428, 434 (1911).\n31Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota and Ontario Paper Co., 261 U.S. 45 (1923).\n32Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., Inc., v. Ray-O-Vac C., 321 U.S. 275, 279 (1944).\n\nCreate or Perish\nAnd so it would seem that honest adherence to the spirit and scope of the\ntests of Section 103 should go a long way toward stabilizing the ultimate test of\npatentable invention.\n3.6\nStatutory Presumption of Validity of a Patent\nNumerous decisions indicate that, certainly as codified by Section 282 of the\nPatent Act of 1952,\na patent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing inva\nlidity of a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.\nThe Supreme Court had previously held 33 that \"the burden of proof to make\ngood this defense\" is \"upon the party setting it up,\" and \"every reasonable doubt\nshould be resolved against him.\"\nBut the courts of the mid-twentieth century have paid little attention to this\npresumption. As Judge Galston has said 34 ,\nin the last two decades, though courts had said prior thereto that\npatents were entitled to a presumption of validity, during the latter\nyears only lip service has been given to that doctrine. Now it becomes\nclear that since there is a statutory presumption, it may not be\nignored.\nThis policy followed the dissent in the early 1940's of Mr. Justice Black 35:\nIn the absence of a statutory prescription to the contrary, I see no\nreason for extending the presumption of validity arising from the\nmere issuance of a patent. . . .\nSection 282 of the Patent Act of 1952 now provides that \"statutory prescrip\ntion.\" The presumption is greatly increased, moreover, when the art cited by\na defendant in an infringement suit is substantially the same as the art before\nthe examiner in the Patent Office.\nIf it were not for prejudices in the field of patents, the trend of decisions in\nthe administrative law field would seem to indicate that there should be, though\nthere is not, a steadily growing tendency to follow the proposal of an earlier\ncourt of appeals 36 in giving special weight to the use of skilled examiners in\nthe Patent Office in determining patentability. Surely, by Section 282, Congress\nintended that patents should not be held invalid merely by \"Monday-morning\nquarterbacking.\"\n33Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories Inc., 293 U.S. 1, 7 - 8 (1934).\n3413 F.R.D. 463, 469.\n35Williams Mfg. Co. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 316 U.S. 364, 392 (1942).\n36United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. Muther, 1 Cir., 288, 287 (1923).\n\nThe Patent Law\n3.7\nCommentary-The Case for Sympathetic Legal Recognition of Inventions\nThere is certainly a feeling in some judicial quarters that patents should not be\ngranted for \"gadgets\" or trivial devices, as contrasted with such inventions as\nthe atomic bomb; and perhaps this may seriously affect the construction put on\nthe Patent Act of 1952.\nThis was certainly the public policy advocated by Mr. Justice Douglas in\nhis opinion in the A&P case 37:\nThe patent involved in the present case belongs to this list of incred\nible patents which the Patent Office has spawned.\nIf I understand Mr. Justice Douglas correctly, he regards a patent for an ev\neryday household item as an \"incredible patent.\" Certainly he so classified one\nfor a collar.\nApparently Mr.\nJustice Douglas views a collar as among \"the\nsimplest of devices,\" one of a \"host of gadgets,\" for the improvement of which\nmen should not be encouraged to devote their inventive faculties. This view, it\nshould be observed, was merely Mr. Justice Douglas's opinion, concurred in, at\nthat time, by Mr. Justice Black and by no other justice.\nThe records show, however, that at another time a particular invention in\na collar was important enough to revolutionize a whole industry, and a patent\nfor it was sustained by one of our greatest judges, Learned Hand 38 . Probably\nJustices Douglas and Black themselves have benefited by that very invention,\nfor it is doubtful whether they still wear the prior-art collars. Furthermore,\nthe Supreme Court itself has sustained a patent for a bare collar button 39, and\nmany patents for articles of wearing apparel and other \"gadgets\" of considerable\nvalue to the public have heretofore been sustained.\nAs later will be made more evident, the part played by individual inven\ntors and small companies in the development of such inventions is still great.\nAnd still pertinent is the unheeded call in late depression years of the then\ncommissioner of patents, the Honorable Conway P. Coe:\nWhat a patent issues to an inventor we purport to give him the\nright, the exclusive right, for a term of 17 years to prevent others\nfrom making, using, or selling the invention covered by it. But we\nsay that with our tongue in our cheek, for we know better than he\nthat by our present method of adjudicating patent rights he will\nfind it exceedingly difficult to prevent the wrongful appropriation\nof his property and may be compelled to stand helpless while he is\ndespoiled. . . .\nMy conviction is that the poor inventor, and through him the pub\nlic, suffers injustice precisely for the reason and to the extent that\nthe monopoly, the exclusive right, purportedly bestowed on him is\n37Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 158\n(1950).\n38Van Heusen Products, Inc. v. Earl and Wilson, 300 F. 922, 925 (1924).\n39Krementz v. The S. Cottle Co., 148 U.S. 556 (1893).\n\nCreate or Perish\nnot now fully safeguarded. What we need is not to decrease but\nto enhance the monopoly called a patent.\nGenuine protection in\nthat form would be the last surviving bulwark standing between the\ninventor and the onslaught of mighty corporations.\nA patent should function as a leveler whereby an individual or a\ncompany of small means may be enabled to hold his or its rights of\nproperty against the prssure of the strongest adversary. It should\nhave a protective character like that of a high-power rifle in the\nhands of a puny man beset by a wildly charging bull elephant. Un\nfortunately, that patent affords no safeguards. . . .\nThe patent system of the United States, more than any other in the\nworld, offers hope, encouragement, opportunity and recompense to\nan individual or a company of small resources. It is as democratic\nas the Constitution which begot it.\nCongress has recognized this problem at least partially and has tried to\nsolve it. The Patent Act of 1952, it is to be hoped, has restored the standard\nof invention at least to what it was originally and continued to be up to very\nrecent years. If questions of public policy are involved, therefore, Congress has\nmade plain that its purpose in enacting the new Patent Act was to remove the\ndiscouragement of inventors induced by prior decisions of the courts.\nParticularly in view of the extremely large number of important and break\nthrough inventions that still flow from independent inventors and small com\npanies 40, we cannot sit back and merely wait for the fruits of government-\nsponsored and large-corporation research. Never before in modern history has\nAmerica been threatened so seriously from abroad - both economically and\nmilitarily - and hence never before has it needed so desperately to encourage\ninvention from all quarters.\nWith the same end in view of encouraging invention, Congress, in 1954, in\nSection 1235 of the Internal Review Code, allowed capital-gains tax treatment to\nprofessional inventors and their backers, under certain circumstances, while dis\ncriminating against authors. Recent interview studies of independent inventors,\nconducted under the auspices of The Academy of Applied Science at Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, revealed fully the error of the Treasury Department's proposed\nrepeal of this Section 1235 together with the removal of sales of patents by an\ninventor (even an amateur inventor) from possible capital gains treatment 41 .\nNow these independent inventors represented a wide range of experience in\ninnovation engaged in from six to more than forty years. Their more impor\ntant inventions included: methods of calibrating D.C. instruments; magnetic\namplified control systems; mechanical-electrical transducers; systems to con\nvert capacitance changes to output voltages; shades that keep out heat but let\nin sunlight; inventions in image intensification; medical instruments; methods\n40Donald A. Schon, \"Champions for Radical New Inventions,\" Harvard Business Review,\nVol. 41, No. 2, p. 77 (1963).\n41\"Angry Inventors,\" in Wall Street Journal, May 10, 1963.\n\nThe Patent Law\nof compacting continuously sheet materials at a high rate of speed - used in\npaper, textiles, and plastics; the fuel oil whistle; gasoline tank design; rever\nberation devices for sound; UHF tuner; electric motors; broad-band amplifiers;\npower steering; the RC oscillator; the dynamic noise suppressor; stereo amplifi\ncation systems; the hydrogen thyratron; cryotrons; flash lamps; electron tubes;\ncathode-ray tube displays for analog computers; high-vacuum apparatus; gauge\ncalibration equipment; pressure and temperature sensitive switches - widely\nused in space vehicles. (The inventions which I have italicized have revolution\nized industries.)\nMost of these inventors sell or exclusively license their inventions, thereby\nplacing themselves under the capital-gains category of Section 1235; or they own\ntheir own companies, which in most cases have been built around one or more\nof their own inventions, with the capital-gains provision used to build up the\ncompany. Their technically successful inventions ranged from about 20 to 80\nper cent, with a mean about one in three. Of these, only about one in five has\nbeen a substantial income-producer to the inventor; the average yearly return\nfrom licensing or selling inventions being from $10,000 to $50,000.\nThe average time lag between the making of an invention and the receipt\nof returns therefrom was five years; and more than half of all the commercially\nsuccessful inventions had to be pioneered on the market by the inventor himself\nbefore others could be persuaded to adopt them. Only one of these inventors\nreceived any financial backing from a government contract in the making of his\ninventions.\nThe inventors interviewed, moreover, had not only provided the country with\nmany new products and processes, but had, in the process, created thousands\nof new jobs, and tens of millions of dollars of new sales. Dare we risk discour\naging this well of current invention by making an already highly dangerous and\nspeculative profession untenable to pursue 42 . Unsympathetic decisions by the\ncourts or administrative agencies can only negate the policy of Congress which\nwould encourage inventors to continue to invent and businessmen to take risks\non the development of invention.\n42Benjamin F. Miessner, \"Today's Inventor - A Study in Frustration,\" in American Engi\nneer, Vol. 33, No. 4, pp. 38 - 40 (1963)."
