  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Description\n\nTraditional strategy courses focus on gaining competitive advantage from\nproducts\n. This course focuses on gaining competitive advantage from organizational design. Special emphasis will be placed on early examples of innovative organizational forms that haven't yet been proven but that may, in the future, provide significant competitive advantages.\n\nThe course should be especially useful for students who hope to be:\n\nConsultants helping companies develop effective organizational designs.\n\nEntrepreneurs looking to leverage organizational design to create strategic advantage for their companies.\n\nLeaders inventing new ways of organizing work to achieve their visions in any kind of organization.\n\nReadings\n\nThe following book is required for the course:\n\nMalone, Thomas W.\nThe Future of Work\n. Harvard Business School Press, 2004. ISBN: 9781591391258.\n\nAdditional readings are also required and cited on the\nReadings\npage. These required readings include excerpts from the following books, although reading these books in their entirety is also highly recommended:\n\nKates, Amy, and Jay R. Galbraith.\nDesigning Your Organization\n. Jossey-Bass, 2007. ISBN: 9780787994945.\n\nSurowiecki, James.\nThe Wisdom of Crowds\n. Anchor/Random House, 2005.

(You can pick the 5 sessions for which you want to write papers.) These papers should contain your reactions to the readings for the session and possibly previous class discussions. Please do not just summarize the readings. Instead, please focus on your own thoughts about the readings. For instance, you might relate the readings to your own experiences, to other readings, to questions you have, or to other possibilities like those discussed in the readings.\n\nYou may, of course, discuss the readings with other students, but the papers are expected to be your individual work.\n\nTeam project\n\nInformation on the team project can be found in the\nProjects\nsection.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass participation\n\n35%\n\nReaction papers (5)\n\n15%\n\nTeam project\n\n50%",
