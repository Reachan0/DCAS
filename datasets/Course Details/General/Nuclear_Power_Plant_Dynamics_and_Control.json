  "course_name": "Nuclear Power Plant Dynamics and Control",
  "course_description": "This short course provides an introduction to reactor dynamics including subcritical multiplication, critical operation in absence of thermal feedback effects and effects of Xenon, fuel and moderator temperature, etc. Topics include the derivation of point kinetics and dynamic period equations; techniques for reactor control including signal validation, supervisory algorithms, model-based trajectory tracking, and rule-based control; and an overview of light-water reactor startup. Lectures and demonstrations employ computer simulation and the use of the MIT Research Reactor.\nThis course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: One lecture / week for 4 weeks, 1.5 hours / session\n\nLabs: One lab session, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Structure\n\nThe course will have five meetings, for a total of six hours of lecture and one hour of laboratory.\n\nThe laboratory session is conducted at the MIT Research Reactor. In this session, students will gain hands-on experience with nuclear reactor operations.\n\nTextbooks\n\nThere is no required textbook for this course. Students are expected to read the course notes assigned for each lecture, and consult supplemental readings from the published literature as distributed in class.\n\nAssignments\n\nStudents should expect to spend about fifteen hours on homework, consisting of:\n\nThree problem sets.\n\nOne short paper: a short summary and critique of a recent journal article on control of complex systems, or an essay on some aspect of reactor control.\n\nGrading\n\nThe course grade is based on attendance, completing the lab and homeworks, and writing a satisfactory paper.",
