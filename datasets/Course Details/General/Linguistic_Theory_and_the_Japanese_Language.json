The first 2/3 of the course will deal with the following topics which I am presently working on - all related to issues of movement:\n\nThe nature of optional movement (e.g., Chomsky 2001, Fox 2000, Miyagawa, to appear (a), Saito 1989, Sauerland and Elbourne 2002)\n\nThe nature of the EPP (e.g., Alexiadou and Anagnostopoulou 1998, Baker 2003, Miyagawa, to appear (b))\n\nThe nature of parametric variation (e.g., Kuroda 1988, Miyagawa, to appear (b), Sigurdsson 2003)\n\nThe nature of floated quantifiers (e.g., Bobaljik, Miyagawa and Arikawa, Ms. 2004)\n\nThe nature of QR (e.g., Fox and Nissenbaum 1999, Johnson and Tomioka 1997, Miyagawa, Ms. 2004a)\n\nThe nature of weak islands (e.g., Miyagawa, Ms. 2004b, Rizzi 1992)\n\nThe nature of maturation: A-chain in acquisition (e.g., Machida, Miyagawa, and Wexler, to appear, Sano et al)\n\nIn addition, we will explore the following topics; these will be in the form of student presentations.\n\nThe nature of agreement, case, and verbal morphology (e.g., Hiraiwa, Ochi, Uchibori 2000, Watanabe 1996)\n\nThe nature of nominal ellipsis (e.g., Hoji 1998, Otani and Whitman)\n\nThe structure of the DP (Watanabe 2004)\n\nProsody and question formation (Ishihara 2003, Y. Kitagawa et al)\n\nRequirements\n\nThe requirements and grading for this course are based on two major assignments: a class presentation and a final course paper.",

Mouton de Gruyter (August 04 version)\nEPP AND SEMANTICALLY VACUOUS SCRAMBLING\nShigeru Miyagawa\nMIT\n1. Saito's Discovery (1989) - evidence used for a widely accepted view of scrambling\nScrambling in Japanese results from a purely optional movement operation (e.g., Fukui 1993;\nKuroda 1988; Saito 1989, 2004; Saito and Fukui 1998; Takano 1998\n(1) a.

Optional movement and the EPP\nReinhart (1995) and particularly Fox (2000) propose a theory of optional operation which\nimposes a requirement on the movement as follows. Fox specifically addresses instances in\nwhich QR may apply optionally.\n(3)\nScope Economy (Fox 2000)\nA Scope Shifting Operation can move XP1 from a position in which it is interpretable\nonly if the movement crosses XP2 and <XP1, XP2> is not scopally commutative. (Fox\n2000:26)\nChomsky (2001) applies this notion of requiring some effect on the output to optional\nmovements such as OS (Holmberg 1986)\n(4) a. v* is assigned an EPP feature only if that has an effect on outcome.\nb. The EPP position of v* is assigned INT.\n(5) Optional operations can apply only if they have an effect on outcome... (Chomsky 2001:34)\n3. Saito (2004) on Saito (1989)\nSaito (1989) adopts is that movement operations are subject to the Proper Binding Condition\n(PBC).\n(6) Traces must be bound. (Fiengo 1977, May 1977)\n\n(7) a. ??Whoi do you wonder [which picture of ti]j John likes tj?\nb. *[Which picture of ti]j do you wonder whoi John likes tj?\nRiemsdijk and Williams (1981).\n(8) a.

Reanalyzing Saito's arguments\nAs noted earlier, Saito (1989) gave following kinds of arguments against reconstruction.\n(17)a. ??Whoi do you wonder [which picture of ti]j John likes tj?\nb. *[Which picture of ti]j do you wonder whoi John likes tj?\n\n(18)a. Whoi ti knows [which picture of whom]j Bill bought tj?\nb. ??

PL\nLongobardi (1987)\n(20) Whati do you wonder whether every boy bought ti? *PL\n4.3. Argument against radical reconstruction\nDirect evidence against two points Saito suggests:\n(i) there is no reconstruction due to the PCB;\n(ii) the wh-phrase in (1b), which has scrambled out of an indirect question, undergoes radical\nreconstruction.\nLebeaux (1988); cf. also van Riemsdijk and Williams (1981), Freidin (1986)). Note the contrast\nbelow.\n(21) ??/*[Which criticism of Johni]j did hei reject tj?\n(22) [Which criticism that Johni heard]j did hei believe tj?\nThe data gives evidence for reconstruction in English, in contrast to the assertion in Saito (1989).\nNishigauchi (2002) observes that there is a similar argument/adjunct asymmetry in Japanese; I\nwill introduce a crucial example from his work later, but because it involves one complication, I\nwill first present a pair of examples below to illustrate the \"Lebeaux\" effect in Japanese.\n(23) a. ??/?* [Minna-no\nJohni-no\nhihan-o]j\nkarei-ga\n[everyone-GEN Johni-GEN criticism-ACC]j\nhei-NOM\n[Hanako-ga\ntj\nosiete-kureta to]\nitta.\n[Hanako-NOM\ntj\ntold.him\nC]\nsaid\n'[Everyone's criticism of John], he said that Hanako told him.\nb.

Escape hatch in indirect question: the real significance of Saito (1989)\nSaito's (1989) \"discovery,\" with some extensions, gives support to two proposals in the\nliterature:\n-- Watanabe's (1992) proposal that an empty operator is moving in wh-in-situ (or alternatively,\nTsai's (1994) idea that wh-in-situ is licensed by unselective binding by Q on C);\n-- A particular version of Kuroda's (1988) idea that there is \"no forced agreement\" in Japanese;\nthe particular version I will demonstrate is that when a Head agrees with an element, the\nspecifier of this Head may host some other element, thus showing that there is no forced\nSpec-Head agreement.\nWhat really is happening with Saito's (10b), repeated below?\n(10) b.\n?Nani-oi\nJohn-ga [\nTaroo-ga\nti\nkatta\nka]\nsiritagatteiru.\nWH-ISL\nwhat-ACCiJohn-NOM [\nTaro-NOM\nti\nbought\nQ]\nwant:to:know\nWH-ISL\n'John wants to know what Taro bought.'\nThe wh-phrase is able to employ the Specifier of CP of the indirect question as an escape hatch.\n(26)\n?Nani-oi\nJohn-ga\n[WH-ISL ti [TPTaroo-ga\nti katta\nka]] siritagatteiru.\nwhat-ACCi John-NOM\n[WH-ISL ti [TP Taro-NOM ti bought Q]] want:to:know\n'John wants to know what Taro bought.'\nTwo possible reasons why the wh-phrase may move through the Spec of CP:\n(i) the scrambling of the wh-phrase into the Spec of CP counts as wh-movement, and fulfills the\n[+wh] selectional requirement (e.g., Takahashi 1993\n(ii) the [+wh] requirement is met even before the wh-phrase moves; an agreement relation is\nestablished between the wh feature on the wh-phrase-in-situ and the Q feature on C\n(ii) is right?\n(27) ?Nani-oi\nJohn-ga\n[WH-ISL ti [TP dare-ga\nti\nkatta\nka]] siritagatteiru ndai?\nwhat-ACCi John-NOM\n[WH-ISL ti\n[TP who-NOM ti bought Q]] want:to:know Q\n'What does John wants to know who bought?'\n(answer: John wants to know who bought A BOOK.)\n\nNo Spec-Head Agreement (cf.

This means that this scrambling has a meaningful effect\non the output of this movement, hence the first movement is licensed. Note, now, that the entire\nsentence in (57) can answer (56a) and (56c), but not (56b).\n(58) Radical reconstruction (\"PF\" scrambling)\nRadical reconstruction occurs only if a quantifier is moved by illicit optional movement.\nThis is a fundamentally different portrayal of radical reconstruction than Saito (1989) and\nSauerland and Elbourne (2002). They assume that radical reconstruction -- or PF scrambling --\n\nis widely prevalent. What I have shown is that PF scrambling occurs in an extremely narrow\nrange of data -- when a quantifier is moved illicitly.\nA prediction about a Condition C violation that should occur even if the antecedent is contained\nin an adjunct.

A Focus-prominent Language: Japanese\n(29) Two Types of Focus\n(E.

Informational Focus and Nuclear Stress\nTwo types of focus:\nIdentificational:\nInformational: topic-focus\nIn the absence of identificational focus, \"focus\" on T picks out an XP and marks it as\n\"topic\". This XP moves to Spec of TP for the EPP. This creates the topic-focus\nstructure.\nIn the absence of identificational focus, the focus stress rule is nuclear stress.\nNuclear Stress Rule: nuclear stress falls on the phrase located lowest on the syntactic tree\n(Cinque (1993), cf. Chomsky and Halle (1968) and Halle and Vergnaud (1987))\n(51) Mary read a book yesterday.\nIdentificationa focus: anywhere\n\n(52) John read a book yesterday.\nNeeleman and Reinhart (1998) point out that scrambling allows a given phrase to move\naway from the position of nuclear stress. In the following Dutch example, the phrase that\nbears the nuclear stress is in bold.\n(53) Dat\nJan\nlangzaam het\nboek\nlas\nthat\nJohn\nslowly\nthe\nbook\nread\n(54) Dat\nJan\nhet\nboek langzaam las\nthat\nJohn\nthe\nbook slowly\nread\nThe following are taken from Ishihara (2000) (Ishihara assumes V-raising to T).\n(55) a. Taroo-ga\n[VP\nhon-o\ntv] katta.\nTaro-Nom\n[VP\nbook-Acc tv] bought\nb. Hon-oi\nTaroo-ga\n[VPti tv] katta\nbook-Acci Taro-Nom\n[VPti tv] bought\n(56) a.

Hon-oi\nTaroo-ga\nkyoo ti katta.\nbook-Acc Taro-Nom\ntoday ti bought\n(57) Focus Rule\nThe focus of IP is a(ny) constituent containing the main stress of IP, as\ndetermined by the stress rule\n(=nuclear stress rule).\n(58) Taroo-ga\n[VP\nhon-o\ntv] katta\nTaro-Nom\n[VPbook-Acc tv] bought\n(59) a. What happened? (focus on IP)\nb. What did Taro do? (focus on VP)\nc. What did Taro buy? (focus on object)\n(60) Hon-oi\nTaroo-ga\n[VP\nti tv] katta\nbook-Acci Taro-Nom\n[VP\nti tv] bought\nNo focus on VP, hence cannot answer \"What did Taro do?\"\n\n5. Formal Feature Issue: All Formal Features Are Merged at the Phase Heads\n5.1. Agreement does not require tense\nModern Greek (Iatridou 1993)\n(61) vlepo ton Kosta\nna tiganizi psaria\n(ECM, no active tense on embedded S)\nsee\nDET Kostas/ACC\nfries\nfish\n'I see Kostans fry fish.'\n(62) elpizo o\nKostas na\ntiganizi psaria(tensed embedded S)\nhope DET Kostas/NOM fries\nfish\n'I hope Kostas fries fish.'\n5.2. Complementizer agreement with subject, Case I (Turkish, Kornfilt 2004)\n(63) a. subject as the target of relativization -- no agreement on the lower verb;\nagreement blocked by the subject e agreeing with C.\n[[ei\ngecenyaz\nada -da\nben-i gor-en] kis i-leri]\n[[\nlast summer\nisalnd-Loc I-Acc see-(y)An] person-Pl]\n'the people who saw me on the isalnd last summer' (No φ-feature\nmorphology; special nominalization form on predicate)\nb. a non-subject as the target of relativization -- agreement on the lower verb\n[[pro gecenyaz\nada-da\nei gor-dug -um]\nkis i-leri]\n[[\nlast\nsummer island-Loc\nsee-DIK-1.sg] person-Pl]\n'the people who(m) I saw on the island last summer' (φ-feature\nmorphology; general indicative nominalization form on predicate).\n5.3.

Speas 1994, but in a different sense).\nV-raising in Non-Pro-Drop Languages\n(22) V-raising and the EPP:\nV-raising for pro-drop: by the EPP. All pro-drop languages have V-raising.\nWhat about non-pro-drop languages?\nFrench: strong V feature of INFL attracts the verb. In pro-drop, it is strong D features in\nAGR. AGR only has D features while T has both V and N features (the latter for Case)."

John Benjamins Publishing Company.\nJelinek (1984) NLLT article:\nSome languages have obligatory pronominal arguments/clitics that count as arguments of the\nverbs. Full NPs are never themselves arguments -- optional adjuncts of some kind.\nBaker's re-statement: (p. 108)\nIn the presence of a pronominal element related to an argument position Y, an overt NP Z cannot\noccupy position Y at S-structure. Z can only be an adjunct to some constitutent from which it\nbinds Y.\n...dislocation of NPs correlates with the presence of agreement almost perfectlyh in Mohawk,\nsince both are present in virtually every every structure. (p. 108)\n(1) A verb X agrees with an NP Y if and only if Y is in a dislocated adjunct position.

Eritunda, n-a-*(ri)-gul-a.\nfruit.5\n1sg.S-T-OM5-buy-FV\n'The fruit, I bought it.'\nThe agreed-with category must be interpreted as definite/specific. This is illustrated for the\nobject below.\n(4) Eritunda,\nn-a-ri-gul-a.\n(\"reversal\" construction)\nfruit.5\n1SG.S-T-OM5-buy-FV\n\n'The fruit, I bought it.'\n(5) \"[t]rue polysynthetic languages...always have agreement and always have dislocation\" (Ibid.,\np. 112). A higher Spec of TP, comparable to the dislocation position in Italian. The\nagreement, therefore, occurs in a specifier higher than the normal Specifier of TP.\nBaker forces the agreed-with phrase to occur in a higher position - thus the agreement to hold\nbetween this higher specifier and some head - by requiring pro to occur in the \"normal\" Spec of\nTP (Ibid., p. 124).\n(6) [TP NPi [TP proi\nT<AGRi>+Verb ... [VP ti...]]]\nKinande allows non-subjects as well as subjects in the Spec of TP, and the verb agrees with\nwhatever occurs there.\n(7) a.\nOmukali\nmo-a-seny-ire\nokukwi (lw'-omo-mbasa).\nwoman.1\nAFF-1.S/T-chop-EXT wood.11LK11-LOC.18-axe.9\n'The woman chopped wood (with an axe).'\nb.\nOlukwi\nsi-lu-li-seny-a\nbakali\n(omo-mbasa).\nwood.11\nNEG-11.S-PRES-chop-FV\nwomen.2\nLOC.18-axe.9\n'WOMEN do not chop wood (with an axe).'\nAnother kind of inversion is with the locative expression. This construction is found with\nunaccusatives and passives of transitives.

One piece of evidence for this has to do with \"augment vowels.\" Nouns often\nbegin with an \"augment\" vowel that matches the vowel of the class that the noun prefix belongs\nto. This augment vowel may drop under the scope of negation and in some other contexts; a\nnoun without this augment vowel has a nonspecific, indefinite interpretation. The following\nexemplifies an object with and without its augment vowel.\n(11) a. Yohani si-a-nzire\no-mu-kali.\nJohn\nNEG-1.S/T-like AUG-CL1-woman\n'John does not like the woman.'\n\nb. Yohani si-a-nzire\nmu-kali.\nJohn\nNEG-1.S/T-like CL1-woman\n'John does not like a(ny) woman.'\nThe agreed-with phrase can never drop its augment vowel.\n(12) a.

It must be packaged with an EPP feature or a Case feature.\nc. If Agr is packaged with one feature, it checks the head's other feature.\n(21) In Greek/Sp, Agr is packaged with the nominative case feature. It therefore checks the EPP\nfeature. a is impossible because nothing triggers movement to Spec, TP. Same as A&A -\nagreement feature on the Verb checks off the EPP feature.\n(22)\nIn Bantu Agr is packaged with the EPP feature. It checks off the nominative case feature\nof T. An NP that is attracted to Spec, TP, must be of the kind that has no Case feature to\ncheck -- it must be an empty pro.\n(23)\nWhy is a possible in, e.g., English? That is, in non-pro-drop languages of IE. The few\nverbal agreement markers are either syntactically inert or are entirely absent in the syntax\nand added in the postsyntactic morphology (cf. Halle and Marantz 1993)."

To make this interpretation possible, the indeterminate pronoun must be c-\ncommanded by the universal -mo, and they must be clausemates.\n(24)a.

(Kishimoto 2001: 600)\nAs Kishimoto notes, while the object position can host an indeterminate pronoun ((24a)), the\nsubject position cannot ((24b/c)).

Covertness of QR vs. Overtness of \"A-scrambling\"\n(24) If A-scrambling in Japanese and QR in English are the same rule, why is one overt and the\nother covert?\n(25) If we are to keep to our spirit of \"scrambling is a routine operation,\" this overt/covert\ndifference cannot be related to some unusual, \"scrambling-specific\" property of these\nlanguages.\n(26) Proposal:\nThe difference arises from an expanded version of Holmberg's Generalization (Holmberg\n1986, 1999, etc.)\n(27) Object Shift cannot apply across a phonologically visible category asymmetrically c-\ncommanding the object position except adjuncts. (Holmberg 1999)\nRevised:\nAn element (in VP) cannot move across a phonologically visible category\nasymmetrically c-commanding it (except adjuncts). (see recent work by Fox\nand Pesetsky for related discussion)\n(28) HG applies at PF (Holmberg 1999).\n(29) Swedish: V and Object Shift (Holmberg 1986)\na.

Most commonly, such a language would be OV.\nBut even in VO, shifting of the object should be allowed if V moves out of the way.\n(31) Overcoming HG: V topicalization (Holmberg 1999)\nKysst har\njag\nhenne inte (bara hallit hennei\nhanden).\nkissed have\nI\nher\nnot (onlyheld her\nby the\nhand)\nNegative Movement (Svenonius 2000)\n\"...the negative object must leave VP overtly\" -- a form of QR subject to HG (Svenonius 2000).\n(32) a.

How is it justified?\nMovement triggered by an optional feature must have some effect on output (scope,\ninformational structure, etc.) (Fox 1995, 2000; Reinhart 1995; Chomsky 2001).\n-\nCovert A-scrambling, being covert, perhaps can only meet this requirement by altering\nscope relation; this is Fox's Scope Economy.\n-\nOvert A-scrambling can affect, for example, informational structure (e.g., Ishihara\n2001), which makes it possible for non-quantifier phrases to undergo A-scrambling.\n(35)\nACD resolution may involve quantifier movement to vP (Legate 2002).\n(36)\nA possible alternative to (34)\nIn English, the relevant operation only applies to quantifiers because the operation is\nQuantifier Raising, not A-scrambling.\n5. Is There QR?\n(37) QR for an object quantifier (or some other VP-internal quantifier) is required for addressing\na type mismatch. Such a quantifier moves to vP, which is of the type that includes <t>.\n(38) vP is a (quasi-)proposition; QR targets vP (Bruening 2001, Fox 2000, Johnson and\nTomioka 1997, etc.)\n(39) An alternative: \"pure\" QR is to the local VP.\n-\nVP is of the same type as vP\n-\nExternal argument is an adjunct (Kratzer 1996)\n\n(40) QR: To VP, for resolution of type mismatch -- required even if there's just one quantifier.\nMovement to vP: (covert) A-scrambling (not QR); subject to the requirement on\noptional movement.\n(41)\nQPsubj [vP QPobj\n[vP\ntsubj [VP\ntobj\n[VP\n...\ntobj\n...\n]]]]\ncovert\nQR\nA-scrambling\nThree-quantifier construction (Bruening 2001); the following taken from Takahashi (2002)\n(42) (At least) one professor gave most students at the linguistics department every book on the\nsyllabus.\n(i) one professorsubj > most studentsgoal > every booktheme\n(ii) most studentsgoal > one professorsubj > every booktheme\n(iii)\nmost studentsgoal > every booktheme > one professorsubj\n6.

Rizzi (1990, 1992)\nWeak Island\n(5)\nA. Relativized Minimality\nB.\nDifferentiating between argument and adjunct extraction (Rizzi 1992; cf. also Cinque\n1990, Rizzi 1990): referentiality\nX can carry a referential index only if it bears an argumental Theta role on some level\nof representation.\n\n(i) if X, a chain, bears a referential index, the head of the chain only needs to bind the\ntail;\n(ii) if not, the head must govern the tail.\n\n(6)\nProblem\nWeak island violations show up in certain cases even with argument wh-phrases.\n(7) Two inter-related questions:\n(i) exactly what is being violated with weak islands (Rizzi's RM)?\n(ii) exactly what is responsible for the (non-)referential nature of chains?\n(8) Proposal for (i): Quantifier-Induced Barriers (Beck 1995, 1996a, 1996b)\nProposal for (ii): Nature of chains and \"referentiality\" (e.g., Beck 1995, Cresti 1995, Lahiri\n2002)\n3.

(wh-island)\n(i)\nFor what n: there are n-many people x, such that you wonder whether I should\ntalk to x.\n(ii) * For what n: you wonder whether it should be the case that there be n-many\npeople that I talk to?\nb. Wieviele\nHunde hat\nKarl\nnicht\ngefuttert? (negative island)\nhow many\ndogs\nhas\nKarl\nnot\nfed\n(i)\nFor which n: there are n dogs that Karl didn't feed.\n(ii) * For which n: it is not the case that Karl fed n dogs.\n\n(12) Quantifier Induced Barrier (QUIB) (Beck 1996a, Beck and Kim 1997)\nThe first node that dominates a quantifier, its restriction, and its nuclear scope is a\nQuantifier Induced Barrier.\n(13)\n*\nBINDERi\nQUIB\nα (e.g., Neg)\nβi\nQUIBs apply only to LF movement (Beck)\n(14) * Was\nglaubt\nniemand,\nwen\nKarl gesehen hat?\nwhat\nbelieves\nnobody\nwhom\nKarl seen\nhas\n'Who does nobody believe that Karl saw?'\nNo problem if there is no QUIB\n(15)\nWas\nglaubt\nHans,\nwen\nKarl\ngesehen\nhat?\nwhat\nbelieves\nHans\nwhom\nKarl\nseen\nhas\n'Who does Hans believe that Karl saw?'\n(16) While I will adopt Beck's approach virtually intact, one assumption I will abandon is the\nidea that only LF movement is subject to QUIBs.\n(17) how many x (from Beck and Kim 1996): outer reading (presuppositional)\nCP\nQUANTIFIER\nwievielei\nC'\nCo\nIP\nRESTRICTION\n[tiLF Hunde]k\nIP\nQUIB\nnicht\nIP\nKarl hat tk gefuttert\n\n(18)\nhow many x (from Beck and Kim 1996): inner reading (non-presuppositional)\n*\nCP\nQUANTIFIER\nwievielei\nC'\nCo\nIP\nQUIB\nnicht\nIP\nRESTRICTION\n[tiLF Hunde]k\nIP\nKarl hat tk gefuttert\nCresti (1995): no portion of a wh-phrase moved out of a wh- island may be interpreted inside the\nisland (cf. Frampton 1990). Another instance of a weak island effect with an argument wh.\n(19)\nHow many people do you wonder whether I should talk to? (wh-island)\n(i)\nFor what n: there are n-many people x, such that you wonder whether I should talk\nto x.\n(ii) * For what n: you wonder whether it should be the case that there be n-many people\nthat I talk to?\n(20) a.\npresuppositional\nfor what n, ... n-many people x....[wh-island .... x....]\nb.\nnon-presuppositional\n*for what n, .... [wh-island ... n-many people ...]\n(21) What is the exact nature of the barrier effect induced by the wh-island? Following Beck\n(1996a) and Beck and Kim (1997), I will assume that any quantificational element\npotentially induces a Quantifier-Induced Barrier.\nSuppose that in a wh-island, this is induced by the question morpheme Q that heads the CP of\nthe island.\n(22) Q, which heads the CP in questions, induces a QUIB; hence the CP, which is a QUIB,\ncannot intervene in a wh-chain in which some portion of the wh-phrase occurs below this\nCP.\n(23) Q is an existential quantifier (Karttunen's 1973; cf. Hagstrom 1998)\n\n4.

Introduction\nSano (2000), Sano, Endo, & Yamakoshi (2001), Okabe & Sano (2002), and\nSano (2003) argue against the A-Chain Deficit Hypothesis (hereafter, the\nACDH) (Borer & Wexler 1987, 1992), which states that A-chains are\nungrammatical for a child until a certain age or level of maturation. Their major\nargument against the ACDH is based on experiments using what they call \"Full\nunaccusatives\" and \"Full passives\" in Japanese, which are shown in (1).\n\n(1)\na.\nButa-san ga zou-san ni tukamat-ta.

Sano (2000) and\nSano, Endo & Yamakoshi (2001) suggest that this cannot account for the early\ndevelopment of Full unaccusatives because children behave differently between\nunaccusatives and unergatives concerning the omission of nominative ga.\n\n(B) Sano (2000) and Sano, Endo, and Yamakoshi (2001) argue against the non-\nraising misanalysis (Miyamoto, Wexler, Aikawa and Miyagawa (1999)), in\nwhich the nominative NP of the unaccusative sometimes (when ga is missing)\ndoes not raise. They point out that children do not produce sentences such as\n(2a) and they do not have any problem in interpreting transitives with null\nobjects as in (2b).\n\n(2)\na.\n*Zou-san ga buta-san ga sizume-ta.\n\nelephant NOM pig * sank\n\n'The elephant sank the pig.'\n\n(Sano 2000: 16)\nb.\nZou-san ga (buta-san o) umeta ka na?\nElephant NOM (pig ACC ) buried Q\n'Did the elephant bury (pro)?'\n(Sano, Endo, & Yamakoshi 2001: 674)\n\nIf it is possible for the nominative NP of an unaccusative to stay in its\ncomplement position, we should also see the nominative case marking on the\ndirect object of transitives as in (2a), according to Sano, etc., something that is\nnot attested in any significant measure.\n2.

They\nused a different corpus--the transcripts of a Japanese child, Sumihare, during\nages 1;11-3;7 (MacWhinney 2000; Noji 1973-77). Their study is particularly\nimportant in examining the nominative case omission at a later stage. (4) shows\nthe results of their study that are relevant here.\n\n(4) Rates of nominative omission according to verb type\n\n(only NPs)\n\nunaccusatives\n\nexistentials\n\nunergatives/\ntransitives\n1;11-\n2;1\n90.6\n80.8\n2;2-\n3;0\n34.2\n32.7\n17.6\n3;1-\n3;7\n9.1\n11.0\n7.9\n\n(Ito and Wexler 2002: 36, Table 7, raw frequencies omitted)\n\n(5)\nThree stages of nominative Case-marker omission in child Japanese\n\nThe first stage, ages 1;11-2;1\nNominative case marking is omitted both in unaccusatives and\nunergatives/transitives.\nThe second stage, ages 2;2-3;0\nNominative case marking is much more frequently omitted for\nunaccusatives than for unergatives/transitives.\nThe third stage, ages 3;1-3;7.\nThe omission rate of nominative markers is not different between the\ntwo categories.\n\n(Ito and Wexler 2002: 34 (38))\n\n3.

First, Sano (2000) uses only tukamaru\n'catchunaccusative' as an example of a \"full\" unaccusative. In fact \"full\"\nunaccusatives - those that allow an \"agentive\" -ni phrase -- are extremely rare.\nSano, Endo and Yamakoshi (2001) also use mitukaru 'find', which they claim\nhas the same pattern of acquisition as tukamaru 'catch'. We are not aware of\nother \"full\" unaccusatives in the language. Second, while giving up on the\nACDH is one option, that per se can only explain the pattern in (6). It would\nhave nothing to say about the discovery in Ito and Wexler (2003) that the pattern\nof nominative case marker drop suggests that unaccusatives begin behaving like\nunergatives at around the age of three. As mentioned already, a plausible way to\nexplain this is that at this stage ACDH is still in effect, hence there is no\ngrammatical A-chain. The children therefore \"misanalyze\" the unaccusatives as\nunergatives in order to avoid violation of the ACDH.\n\nThere is one crucial point Sano does not mention concerning the unaccusative\nverb tukamaru 'get caught'. There exists a homophone of the unaccusative verb\ntukamaru. Note that tukamaru in (7) is an unergative verb that means 'hold on to\n(something).'\n\n(7)\nTaroo-wa sikkari roopu-ni tukamat-ta.\n\nTao--Nom firmly rope-to catch-Past\n\n'Taroo took a firm hold on the rope.\n\n(8) (=1a) Buta-san-ga zoo-san-ni tukamat-ta. (full unaccusative)\n\nPig-NOM elephant-by catch (unacc.)-PAST\n\n'The pig was caught by the elephant.'\n\nThe unergative verb tukamaru 'hold on to (something)' in (7) is not tested in\nSano (2000), but the children would not have a problem in interpreting (7)\nbecause it does not involve an A-chain\n\nObserve other unaccusative verbs in (9). They further confirm that\nchildren can start interpreting unaccusatives early, at the age of three. Even G1\nchildren perform well in understanding unaccusatives, which is consistent with\nour hypothesis that the unergative misanalysis is available once children reach\nthe age of three.\n\n(9)\nUnaccusatives\n\nG1\n3;1 - 3;8\nG2\n3;10 - 4;7\nG3\n4;6 - 6;0\nTotal\nsizumu\n'sink'\n78.6%\n(11/14)\n87.5%\n(14/16)\n100%\n(16/16)\n89.1%\n(41/46)\nagaru 'rise'\n92.9%\n(13/14)\n100%\n(16/16)\n100%\n(1616)\n97.8%\n(45/46)\nUnaccusative\n(total)\n85.7%\n(24/28)\n93.8%\n(30/32)\n100%\n(32/32)\n93.5%\n(86/92)\n(Sano, 2000:12, Table 2)\n\nThe children in Sano's (2000) experiment performed almost perfectly on the\nunergatives as shown in (10), which is expected.\n\n(10)\nUnergatives\n\nG1\n3;1 - 3;8\nG2\n3;10 - 4;7\nG3\n4;6 - 6;0\nTotal\nnaku 'cry'\n100%\n(14/14)\n100%\n(16/16)\n93.8%\n(15/16)\n97.8%\n(45/46)\nwarau\n'laugh'\n76.9%\n(10/13)\n100%\n(16/16)\n100%\n(16/16)\n93.3%\n(42/45)\nUnergative:\n(total)\n88.9%\n(24/27)\n100%\n(32/32)\n96.9%\n(31/32)\n95.6%\n(87/91)\n(Sano, 2000:10, Table 1)\n\nNote that the unaccusative verb agaru 'rise' has a homophone, the unergative\nverb agaru 'go up, climb'. Sizumu 'sink' arguably has a homophone sizumu 'go\ndown.\n\nSummary:\n(11)\na.\nNominative case omission shows that the NP is not raised for\nunaccusatives because A-chains are not fully formed for\nyoung children under three. (Miyamoto et al. 1999, Ito and\nWexler 2002);\n\nb\nChildren start utilizing the structure of unergatives to\ninterpret unaccusatives in the third year. Therefore,\nnominative\ncase\nomission\nreduces\nto\nthe\nlevel\nof\ntransitive/unergatives at this stage. Their interpretation of\nunaccusatives improves once they acquire the unergative\nstrategy.\nc.\nPassives are delayed because A-chains are not fully formed\nthroughout the three stages.\n\n4.

In (25b), -sae 'even' attaches to the transitive verb tukamae\n'catch', which is passivized. As we can see, the ni-phrase here is outside the\nscope of the verb, so that the only item that can be focused is the verbal head.\n\n(26) Taroo-ga omawari-san-ni\ntukamae-rare-sae sita.\nTaro-NOM policeman-DAT\ncatch-PASS-eve light-verb\n\n'Taro was caught even by a policeman.'\n\n4.3 The unergative misanalysis and the structure of Full unaccusative\n\n(27) Full unaccusative\n\nTP\n\nX-gai T'\n\nvP T\n\nv'\n\nVP v\n\nY-ni\nV'\n\nSince the ni-phrase lies within the VP and is selected by the unaccusative verb (a\nvery small number in the language, as it turns out), it is plausible that children\nutilize the structure of unergatives to interpret the Full unaccusative. The ni-\nphrase is just like a locative or a goal PP selected by unergative verbs\n\n5. Development of passives in Japanese\n\nWhat about passives? We suggest that Japanese children show difficulty with\nactional passives because there are no homophonous adjectival passives in\nJapanese.\n\nWasow (1977)\n\nBorer and Wexler (1987), for example, propose that English speaking children\ndo much better with passives of actional verbs than non-actional (experiencer\nverb) passives (Maratsos et al., 1985) because they interpret actional verb\npassives as adjectival passives).\n\n(28) A phraseαis an s-homophone ofβif αand βhave distinct structure but\ncommon pronunciation.\n(Babyonyshev et al. 2001:7)\n\nIf their language has s-homophone adjectival passives, children under certain\nage substitute the structure of adjectival passive for the verbal passive -- this is\nhow they get around the ACDH.\n\nMachida (2004) argues that the passive of psychological verbs followed by an\naspect morpheme -te i (ru) (resultative) is the only possible adjectival passive in\nJapanese. The degree adverb totemo 'very', which typically modifies adjectives,\ncan modify the passive of the psyschological verb ais 'love' with -te i (ru) as we\ncan see in (29a). But it cannot modify a verbal passive such as 'was eaten' as\nshown in (29b).\n\n(29)\na.\nTaro-wa kazoku-ni totemo ais-are-te i-ru.\n\nTaro-Top family-by very love-Pass-Past-te i-Pre\n\n'Taro is loved by his family very much.'\nb.\nKaeru-ga hebi-ni *totemo tabe-rare-ta.\nfrog-Nom snake-by very eat-Pass-Past\n'lit. A frog was very much eaten by a snake.'\n\nTerzi and Wexler's (2002) finding that in Greek, which also does not have s-\nhomophone adjectival passives of the verbal passive, children's comprehension\nof even the actional passive is delayed."
