  "course_description": "This course is an intensive introduction to architectural design tools and process, and is taught through a series of short exercises. The conceptual basis of each exercise is in the interrogation of the geometric principles that lie at the core of each skill. Skills covered in this course range from techniques of hand drafting, to generation of 3D computer models, physical model-building, sketching, and diagramming. Weekly lectures and pin-ups address the conventions associated with modes of architectural representation and their capacity to convey ideas. This course is tailored and offered only to first-year M.Arch students.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session\n\nDescription\n\nThis course is an intensive introduction to the disciplines that impact the reciprocity between drawing and making in architectural design process, learned primarily through a series of weekly or bi-weekly exercises. The pedagogical aim of the course is two-fold.\n\nFirst, the exercises, lectures and workshops are designed to impart specific skills associated with the generation and representation of designed objects. These skills range from techniques of hand drafting, to generation of 3D computer models, physical model building, sketching, diagramming, and computing. The conceptual basis of each exercise is in the interrogation of the geometric principles that lie at the core of each technique, thus 'generalizing' the specific technique in order to display its wider generative possibilities. This process will also serve to exhibit the biases inherent in all drawing techniques as well as their relationships to their methods of making. These exercises establish a relationship with studio, and anticipate the instruments necessary to approach studio design problems.\n\nSecond, the weekly lectures and pin-ups address the conventions associated with various modes of architectural representation, and their capacity to convey ideas. Instances of representation throughout the history of architecture will illustrate the relationship between specific techniques and the kind of architecture they engender. Pin-ups will address the entire range of issues associated with presenting architecture through drawings, including conceptual clarity, presentation manner, legibility, and the like.\n\nExercises will require 3-8 hours of work (outside class meeting times) each week to adequately complete. This course is conceived to serve design studio rather than interferes with it; therefore students should not exceed 8 hours of work per week on the exercises. In general, lectures and assignment presentations will occur on Thursdays, with pin-ups and workshops on Tuesdays. Attendance at all class meetings is mandatory. Most importantly, be respectful and engaged during fellow students' pin-ups.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBecause this course is offered to first-year Master of Architecture students, all participants are expected to have a fundamental understanding of design principles as well as a substantial skill set in both computer and physical modeling.\n\nRequired Resources\n\nStudents will be asked to employ various techniques in modeling and representation. A variety of tools and software are available for the design process, and it is up to the student to elect which is most applicable.\n\nAs a general rule, however, students will find themselves using\nRhinoceros\n(r)\nfor computer-modeling, and\nV-Ray\nfor renderings.",

Following the methods described in exercise 1,\ntrace these line segments through all projections, and ultimately into\nthe true shapes of the plane figures. These intersection lines can be\nconceived as 'fold lines' in the object.\nThe resulting spatial entity has been split at the intersecting plane, with\none half mirrored across the plane. The actual spatial fold (ridge curve,\nin general terms) naturally sits entirely on the intersecting plane, which is\ncalled the osculating plane of the ridge.\nThe process can be repeated with multiple planes (and therefore folds),\nso long as the resulting form is rigorously traced and considered at each\nstep in the process, else, osculating planes will produce object self-\nintersections and other difficulties.\n\nSTEP 1: DEFINE FOUR ADJOINING OBLIQUE PLANE FIGURES (+ THEIR TRUE SHAPES)\n\nSTEP 2: DEFINE AN INTERSECTING PLANE - USING A SPECIAL CASE RAMP PLANE, FROM EDGE VIEW\n\nSTEP 3: INSCRIBE LINES OF INTERSECTION ON PLANE FIGURES (+ ON THEIR TRUE SHAPE PROJECTIONS)\n\nASIDE: THE RESULTING SPATIAL ENTITY HAS BEEN SPLIT AT THE INTERSECTING PLANE, WITH\nONE HALF MIRRORED ACROSS THE PLANE, PRODUCING A FOLD\n\nSTEP 4: IN THE VERTICAL PROJECTION, REFLECT ALL POINTS AND LINES ACROSS THE INTERSECTION LINE\n\nSTEP 5: IN THE HORIZONTAL PROJECTION, POINT LOCATIONS RETAIN THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE AXIS\n\nSTEP 6: CONNECT THE TRANSLATED POINTS IN THE HORIZONTAL PROJECTION\n\nNOTE: THIS PROCESS ALWAYS PRODUCES A VALID SPATIAL OBJECT, BUT DOES NOT GUARANTEE IT WILL NOT SELF-INTERSECT\n\nFINAL SPATIAL OBJECT AND DRAWING (EXCLUDES DESCRIPTIONS OF TRUE SHAPES)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n4.105 Geometric Disciplines and Architecture Skills: Reciprocal Methodologies\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
