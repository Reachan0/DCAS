  "course_description": "D-Lab Development addresses issues of technological improvements at the micro level for developing countries—in particular, how the quality of life of low-income households can be improved by adaptation of low cost and sustainable technologies. Discussion of development issues as well as project implementation challenges are addressed through lectures, case studies, guest speakers and laboratory exercises. Students form project teams to partner with mostly local level organizations in developing countries, and formulate plans for an IAP site visit. (Previous field sites include Ghana, Brazil, Honduras and India.) Project team meetings focus on developing specific projects and include cultural, social, political, environmental and economic overviews of the countries and localities to be visited as well as an introduction to the local languages.",

The course also prepares students to focus on specific issues, such as the need for potable water, low-cost agricultural processing equipment, basic sanitation, and affordable energy, specifically in communities where students will travel during IAP [\nMIT's\n\nIndependent Activity Period\n, a month-long intersession between fall and spring terms\n.] Students will develop working relationships with partnering institutions in developing nations to ensure that the field trips provide both a learning opportunity and an international social network to test the viability of technological solutions jointly crafted by the students and the hosting communities.\n\nD-Lab: Development begins with a historical understanding of why conventional developmental efforts have not universally enhanced the quality of life of low-income households and communities. This is followed by a series of hands-on workshops in which students learn practical approaches towards addressing these issues. These workshops are interspersed with discussions and case studies, led by the course staff and guest speakers who have developed and implemented technological solutions in specific topic areas such as: energy, lighting systems, agricultural technologies, low-cost housing, water, sanitation, micro enterprises, and health. The discussion of case studies also provides students the opportunity to select problem areas for deeper engagement during the IAP field trip. The third part of the course is focused on the preparation for the field trip by sensitizing students to the realities of fieldwork in unfamiliar settings, and discussing how to build enduring institutional relationships with communities for future collaboration. Students will work in small groups studying the history, culture, language, economy and politics of the communities they plan to visit during IAP to understand the context within which their particular technological innovations must be embedded.\n\nGraduate students taking the course for graduate credit will select a technology and/or an implementation strategy within a community organization and perform in-depth research and analysis to prepare a case study on the topic.\n\nStudent Views on D-Lab, from MIT Admissions Blogs\n\nPaul B.

In Haiti, wood charcoal is\nthe primary source of cooking fuel, but its production\ncontributes to deforestation and environmental degra-\ndation. A team of researchers at MIT devised a method\nfor producing charcoal that uses the waste material\nfrom sugar cane processing to make an alternative form\nof charcoal. This case outlines their experiences during\nthe initial fi eld trials in Petite Anse, Haiti and challenges\nstudents to identify stakeholders and propose appropri-\nate implementation strategies.\nPetite Anse\nHaiti:\nPopulation 7,656,166\nArea: 27,560 sq, kilometers\nLife Expectancy: 52 years\nAverage Per Capita Income: US$500\nPetite Anse, a small fi shing village in northern Haiti, is\npoor, even by Haitian standards. Government services\nare largely unavailable--most social and civil services\nare provided through local churches. Unfortunately, the\nchurches do not have the resources to meet the needs\nof the entire community, and the majority of the popula-\ntion lives in extreme poverty. The village is crowded\nand few people have access to safe water, adequate\nsanitation or even rudimentary heath services. In\nresponse to these needs, the Friends of Petite Anse\n(FPA) was formed and obtained funding to run a school\nand a clinic in one of the church buildings. The lunch\nprovided by the school is the only decent meal that some\nof the children get each day. The programs sponsored\nby FPA are greatly appreciated by the local community,\nand FPA has a commitment to improve these services\nEnvironment: Haiti is 98% deforested\nHaiti\nHaiti\nH\nPetite Anse\nse\nWhat is charcoal?\nCharcoal is the product of incom-\n\ndried in the sun.\n\nFuel from the Fields\nA Case Study of Sugarcane Charcoal Technology\nThe Charcoal Field Trial\nThe MIT team arrived in Petite Anse to fi nd that the\nchurch was well-prepared for their visit. Eager to get\nstarted as quickly as possible, they took stock of the\navailable resources and found that the pastor of the\nchurch had arranged to have a truckload of bagasse\ndelivered to the rectory. The supply of bagasse was\nplentiful; a sack of cassava root, known locally as\nmanioka, had been purchased at the market, Members\nof the community were eager to help--sorting and\ndrying the bagasse, peeling and grating the manioka,\nand preparing the kiln. Within a few hours, the fi rst\ncharcoal burn was underway.\nThe next morning, the air of anticipation was palpable\nas the team opened up the kiln to examine the results\nof the fi rst burn. A crowd had assembled--in addition\nto members of the cooperative who had helped on the\nfi rst day, other members of the community had come\nto watch, including Antonio Etienne, a local business-\nman who had gone to school in the United States.\nOne of the poorer neighborhoods in\nPetite Anse, Haiti.\nThe results were promising, and the members of the\ncommunity seemed encouraged by the sight of the\ncharred bagasse and were eager to move on to the next\nphase--forming the briquettes.\nAs the cassava porridge cooked, Antonio voiced his\nexcitement for the project, but he also raised concerns\nregarding the use of a food crop as part of the process.\nHe explained that there might be local, non-edible plants\nthat could act as a binder, such as the cactus that grew\naround the edge of the rectory yard. He went on to say\nthat he could see a day when a larger, higher capacity\nbriquette factory churned out hundreds of thousands of\nsugarcane briquettes for the masses. A member of the\nMIT team explained that the goal of the current incarna-\ntion of the project was maximizing job creation, hence\nthe small scale, to which Antonio countered that a great\nfactory producing briquettes would create far more jobs\nthan a decentralized approach in rural Haiti. As the\npotential future directions for the project were debated,\nthe fi rst batch of over a hundred bagasse briquettes\nCassava fl our is made from the\ntropical root crop cassava (also\nknown as manioka) which histori-\ncally served as a basic foodstuff for\nrural inhabitants of Latin America\nand surrounding tropical regions\nsuch as Haiti.

      "content": "D-Lab\nPractical PV\n\nDue: October 16\nth, O009\nYou are in charge of designing a solar panel installation for a rural health post. The\nrequirements for the given location are as follows:\n- There is a 220W freezer that needs to run 24/7\n- The health post is open until 9pm, and, on average, they have to turn the lights on\nfrom 6pm until they close. Given their needs, it seems that the most adequate\ninstallation would be 2 fluorescent lights of 15W each.\n- They have an amateur radio to communicate with the clinic in the city, that\nconsumes 40W, and it is usually on for two hours every day.\n- The health post is staffed every day of the year.\n1. Calculate the average daily energy consumption at the health post.\n2. The health post is located in a region that receives an average of eight hours of sun\nper day year round, and one can assume a solar irradiance of 1,000 W/m2. How\nmany panels will need to be installed to satisfy the energy demands of the health\npost given the following data?\n- The available solar panels have an efficiency of 12.5%, and a surface of 0.6 m2\n- The charge controller has an efficiency of 80%\n- Since all items in the health post run of AC, an inverter is needed. The inverter\nhas an efficiency of 80%\n- The batteries are 90% efficient in storing energy\n- For the purpose of this exercise, only consider the efficiencies outlined above,\nand disregard any other possible efficiencies in the system.\n3. How many deep cycle 12 V batteries capable of providing 100 Ah each would be\nneeded for the system to withstand a 3 day blackout?\n4. Calculate the total amount of energy generated over the lifetime of a solar panel (30\nyears) for the system designed in question 2 (hint: note that the energy generated\nwill be slightly higher than the energy requirements for the health post).\n5. Assume that each battery costs $100, and has a useful battery life of 3 years for this\ntype of applications. Assume also that each solar panel costs $250, and has a life\nexpectancy of 30 years. Calculate the cost of kWh for the system considering the\nentire lifespan of the solar panels.\n6. Compare the result above with the cost of kWh in Massachusetts (data provided by\nNSTAR for residential customers for the last quarter of 2009: 9.219 cents/kWh) and\nthe country where you will be traveling (hint: look up rates for capital city provided by\nlocal power company. If hard to find, look up neighboring countries). Reflect on\nthese numbers, and suggest what your recommendations would be to bring costs\ndown, and make this implementation more cost-effective.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.701J / 11.025J / 11.472J D-Lab I: Development\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Who do you need to contact,\nand when? Estimate the time you will spend on the different steps.\nPrior to the trip, I will communicate with our community partners to identify possible\nmanufacturers of the grater, preferable in Offuman or Bamboi so that transportation to\nthe manufacturer will be simplified, however it may be necessary to work with a metal\nworker in one of the larger towns (Techiman, Sunyani or Wenchi). I will also work\nclosely with Somin Lee, who was on the 2.009 team that developed the grater, to\ndiscuss possible design improvements and to finalize the drawings necessary for\nmaking the grater. I will prepare documentation of the grater including pictures of the\ncurrent prototype. I will pack up the parts of the grater that we will bring with us (the\ntooling for making the grating sheets and the mold for casting the flywheel) and\nfamiliarize myself with how these were made. Upon arriving in Offuman, I will contact\nthe manufacturer that we identified in order to start the production of the prototype. I will\n\nalso locate a source of cement so that the community can help cast the flywheel. I will\nalso need to find a tailor who could sew the seat. I will also need to work with Pastor\nGeorge and the Chief in Asampu to discuss funding/financing for the grater and to\ndetermine how it will be used--owned by an individual who creates a micro-enterprise,\nowned by the school to raise money for supporting programs, etc.\nI estimate that it will take about a week to make the prototype, and then a couple of\ndays for the community to cast the flywheel. We will run field tests and interviews on\nthree successive days, and then follow up about a week later to get additional input.\nFollowing this input, we will meet with community leaders to discuss the implementation\nplan and the opportunities for expansion into other villages. We will also meet with the\nmanufacturer to discuss the market potential for the grater.\nWhat are the benefits of your project? Who will benefit from your project and\nhow?\nThe cassava grater is a labor-saving device that will benefit the village women in\nAsampu and New Longoro by providing a means to quickly and more easily produce\ngrated cassava, both for human consumption and for producing binder for making\ncharcoal out of agricultural waste.\nIt will also eventually provide an income generating opportunity for those producing\ncassava graters.\nHow will you assess the success of your project?\nInitially, we will get feedback on the device through interviews with potential users. We\nwill also leave behind a follow-up survey to track the use of the grater and get additional\nuser input.\nWhat key pieces of equipment or materials that you will need for this project.\nLocate a source and/or estimate a price for them.\nTo be purchased in-country:\n-\nrebar\n-\ncement\n-\ncanvas for the seat\n-\nbicycle cranks\napproximate cost: $150\nTo bring from US\n-\ntooling for making grating sheets\n-\npre-cut sheet metal for making grating sheets (just in case)\n-\nmolds for casting flywheel\nall available from 2.009 prototype or in D-Lab\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.701J / 11.025J / 11.472J D-Lab I: Development\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "D-Lab: Development\nSP.721 Fall 2009\n\nAppropriate & Intermediate Technology\nClass Outline for September 16, 2009:\n-\nHistory of Development (1970-1990): Appropriate and Intermediate Technology\n-\nCase Studies: PeePoo and PlayPump\n\nHistory of Development (Continued):\nLast time, Bish talked about some different dimensions of development: the social and\neconomic aspects, the political aspects and the technological aspects. You can imagine that\nafter World War II, people had visions of emerging independent nations moving out of colonial\nrule with large-scale technological innovation. It did not exactly happen as people had hoped.\n\nAs a class, we can discuss some reasons why development did not happen the way people\nenvisioned. There was a lot of corruption and inequality that did not get reduced over time. In\nmany cases, the elite ended up getting richer and the poor ended up getting poorer. Jobs were\nnot created to the extent that we needed. Mass migration to the cities was encouraged, but the\njobs did not necessarily materialize as promised. Technology infrastructure did not advance as\nmuch as necessary for supporting urban industries. We cannot really take advantage of the\ncheap labor force and spur mass production without good roads to transport the materials and\nproducts. The decrease in agricultural labor as people migrated to the cities was compounded\nby an increase in population, leading to strains on the food supply. Many resources were being\ndepleted in rural areas. Industries were dominated by monopolies that extracted resources\nwithout developing in-country capacity. Several countries ended up with authoritarian regimes,\nrather than the democratic structures that we wanted to thrive. It was complicated because\ncolonialism took away much of the functioning tribal or indigenous leadership. The regional\nimbalances from unstable government and tribal/ethnic tensions discouraged foreign\ninvestment. Prior to the 1970's, researchers were looking at macroeconomic indicators, not as\nmuch at the human indicators like the statistics on health and education from the World Fact\nQuiz in the first class. It is also important to remember that the informal sector is larger than the\nformal sector of employment in many countries, but is not considered in most of the statistics\nfrom multilateral organizations. Take India, for example, where much of the food is purchased\nlocally from subsistence-level smallholder farmers and sellers. There is often this perception\nthat decentralized farming is not working from looking at the numbers, and yet interestingly\nthere is now a movement back toward supporting local agriculture in the US where food is being\ntransported long distances through cold storage infrastructure. If we have learned anything for\nsure, it is that no single factor is going to end global poverty. We cannot say that poverty will be\neliminated by job creation, because we still need a healthcare system, access to markets, and\nso forth. Bish reminds us that we need institutions for development, but while government is\nimportant, it cannot do everything on it's own. Likewise, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\nplay an important role, but are also not as effective if working alone. Organization is important,\nbut it is more complicated than that.\n\nIn 1973, a very influential collection of essays was published by E. F. Schumacher called Small\nis Beautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered which challenged the idea that larger\nscale and increased productivity are paramount to development. Schumacher argues that it is\nimportant for people to feel like they are doing meaningful work and take pride in it, rather than\nonly push for automation and higher throughput. This set the stage for moving in a direction that\ntakes into account the human aspect, and not simply financial success. For example, there has\nbeen increasing attention on concepts such as the triple bottom line, which looks at the impact\non people, planet and prosperity.\nPage 1 of 7\n\nIntermediate Technology:\nFrom this shift in perception toward more holistic approaches, what started to emerge was this\nconcept of intermediate and appropriate technologies. There are several ways in which\ntechnologies are considered to be intermediate: 1) in price, and 2) in time, as some\ntechnologies are meant to be transitional and support people in moving from manual labor using\nhand tools to large-scale mechanized technology. Take pressing peanut oil as an example,\nwhere the existing technologies might be an indigenous method of pressing oil by hand, which\nis both time-consuming and labor-intensive, and mechanized oil presses at the other extreme,\nwhich may require a very high capital investment of thousands of dollars and infrastructure such\nas electricity. In this situation, an intermediate technology might be a $200 ram press that uses\na lever to press out oil with more force than current manual methods, helping to improve the\nspeed and output of the production process. Similarly, a $375 press that produces 500 bricks a\nday can be considered intermediate technology in helping with the transition from molding bricks\nby hand to using an industrial brick maker that costs $23,000 and produces 10,000 bricks a day.\n\nAnother example of intermediate technology is the treadle\npump, which enables farmers to provide a greater\namount of water to their plants more easily compared to\nwatering\nby\nbucket,\nwhile\nrequiring\nmuch\nless\ninfrastructure than constructing irrigation dams and pipes.\nOther examples include a mixed method of making\nroofing tiles that utilizes both motorized machinery and\nmanual work. One workshop that is using this method is\nrun by a cooperative of women who have been widowed\nand socially ostracized. These women have been able to\nsell every tile they make and transport to market,\nenabling\nthem\nto\nsupport\nthemselves\nand\nbe\nindependent. In this case, one of the immediate\nlimitations is actually transport rather than production,\nsince the cooperative is at the bottom of a hill and the\nwomen have to get the tiles to market.\nCourtesy of Alfinio Flores. Used with\npermission.\n\nThere is an interesting niche here, as intermediate technologies work when it is too expensive\nfor mass manufacturers to get their larger-scale technologies to certain communities because of\ndiminishing economies of scale. Intermediate technologies are more affordable and can be\nmore decentralized, helping to bridge that last mile of distribution. Additionally, where specific\nskilled labor is required, intermediate technologies may have an important place. For example,\nyou can imagine that it may not make sense to use a mechanical combine for flower picking.\n\nAppropriate Technology:\nWhat makes a technology appropriate? Students threw out areas of consideration such as:\n-\nMaintainability, reparability\n-\nNeed\n-\nQuality\n-\nAffordability\n-\nBenefits, such as increased\nproduction\n-\nLocal materials, local production\n-\nLow ecological impact\n-\nCultural acceptability,\nappropriateness for social context\n-\nFit within infrastructural environment\n-\nTransparency, understandability\n-\nEase of use, match to local skills\n-\nDurability, reliability\nPage 2 of 7\n\nConnecting back to the roots of this movement from Small is Beautiful, the traditional definition\nof appropriate technology also includes creating meaningful jobs, using decentralized renewable\nenergy, small-scale, and open source as part of its ethos. Each of these areas could be\nexplored in much more depth than we have time for today. If you are interested in continuing the\ndiscussion, take a look at the D-Lab: Design course that is offered in the spring.\n\nAn example of appropriate technology is the sari cloth filter.\nIt was found that the transmission of cholera could be\nreduced by 50% during an outbreak if people fold a sari\n(women's clothing in India) several times and use it to filter\nwater. This is something that is low-cost, simple, locally\navailable, easy to implement and yet has an incredible\npotential for positive impact - what is important here is\nknowledge transfer. Also, every technology has its limits so\nthere is a need to communicate the limits of the sari cloth\nfilter as well. Cholera bacteria is much bigger than other\nbacteria and viruses, so this type of filtration cannot ensure\nthat the water is safe to drink.\nPhoto courtesy of the National Science\nFoundation.\n\nAnother\ncommonly\ncited\nexample\nof\nappropriate\ntechnology is the pot-in-pot evaporative cooler. It works by\nhaving a pot within a pot, separated by a layer of dirt that\ncan be moistened, so the interior is cooled as the water\nevaporates. In these pots, vegetables can last 2-3 weeks\nwithout refrigeration instead of just a few days, enabling\nhouseholds to store food longer. The coolers also enable\nfarmers to wield more negotiating power and command\nbetter prices in the market by helping to reduce the\npressure to sell before the vegetables go bad. Local\npotters\ncan\nbe\ntrained\nto\nmake\nthese\n\"desert\nrefrigerators,\" but the key word is \"desert\" because this\ntechnique works much better in areas of low humidity. The\npot-in-pot coolers do not work as well during the wet\nseason or in certain climates, and can be difficult to\ntransport. In Nigeria, a teacher from a family of potters\nnamed Mohammed Boh Abba developed these coolers utilizing locally available materials and\ntraditional knowledge. There are now tens of thousands of these pots in Nigeria and other parts\nof the world, and the teacher has also done well for himself with a university appointment and\nseveral awards.\nPhotos (c) Rolex Awards for Enterprise.\nAll rights reserved.

For\nexample, Whirlwind makes wheelchairs out of materials that may not have fit into the traditional\ndefinition of locally available - yet if something is available locally, then it is locally available.\nThe bearings in Whirlwind's wheelchairs are actually old bearings from ceiling fans, but they can\nbe sourced locally instead of imported. Whirlwind engages local labor in taking advantage of\nlocally available resources, rather than limiting themselves to raw materials that can be grown or\ndug up. There is certainly a lot of skill from indigenous manufacturing, but sometimes the\nexisting infrastructure can support more and we do not have to constrain ourselves to the\ntraditional definition of appropriate. Plastic sheets may soon start to be considered a locally\nDevelopment through Dialogue, Design & Dissemination\n\navailable material, as new supply chains are being built up and communities are starting to\naccumulate more plastic waste to recycle into sheets.\n\nThere are many other examples of organizations taking advantage of the evolving infrastructure,\nor even developing their own infrastructure to help support certain technologies. When solid-\nstate white LEDs (light-emitting diodes) first came out, they were about $12 each. An\norganization called Light Up the World would purchase lower-quality white LEDs, which might\nhave had a lifetime of around 10,000 hours instead of over 20,000 hours, and then assemble\nsmall circuit boards locally to make small lights for housing and street-side vendors. Iqbal\nQuadir started a movement called Grameen Phone to provide phone service in rural\nBangladesh. Interestingly, he had to start a telecom company to do it because the necessary\ninfrastructure was not there yet. It is also important to consider different types of infrastructure,\nsuch as the financial infrastructure. At the time that Grameen Phone started, cell phones were\nnot particularly cheap so they needed a method of financing, which is where microfinance came\nin. In order to cater to people living in poverty, it is important to understand their cash flows.\nHarish Hande, founder of SELCO Solar Company in India, argues that every technology can\nbecome affordable with the right financing. He often shares the story of his interview with a\nwoman who said that she could not possibly pay the full price of 300 rupees a month for a small\nsolar photovoltaic system, but she could pay 10 rupees a day. Harish Hande turns the notion\nthat solar energy is expensive for the poor on its head, saying that the rich are the ones who\nneed subsidies. A big takeaway here is that if we can get the supply chain in place and make\nthe price affordable, our technology may become more appropriate. While there is a lot of room\nfor improvement within the appropriate technology movement, there are also many positive\nlessons that we can retain.\n\nCase Studies:\nNext, the class discussed some technologies from the readings, starting with the PeePoo bag\nand the PlayPump. Students started by responding to a quick, informal survey about their\nimpressions of the technologies on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being an excellent idea. Most\npeople thought the PeePoo was around 3 and the PlayPump fell at about 4. The class then\ndiscussed what they liked and did not like about the technologies, based on the information that\nthey had.\n\nPeePoo:\nAmy wondered how many classes at MIT get to talk about something\ncalled PeePoo. Students seemed to have mixed feelings about the\ntechnology overall. One person thought that one-time-use bags would\nrequired a lot of distribution, upkeep and maintenance cost. Another\nstudent pointed out that if the bags are being used in slums, the\npopulation tends to be more dense, potentially making distribution easier.\nSomeone came back with the argument that full-compliance in use is\nimportant for preventing disease transmission, particularly in crowded\nareas (in surveys, 85% of people said they would use the PeePoo). When\nAmy asked how many students in the class would use PeePoo bags for\nthe next week, only 5 raised their hands. It is especially important to\nconsider the cultural context and the use of bags may not be appropriate\nin some communities, especially for the women. In some slums, however,\npeople are already defecating plastic bags and throwing them away as\n\"flying toilets.\" People may already be used to open defecation and less\nself-conscious about privacy. There are possibilities of finding situations where these bags can\nbe effective, but the creators may not be thinking in that way. Advertising has compared the\nbags to having the same impact and being as revolutionary as computers. One student was\n\nPhoto courtesy of\nPeepoople\n(info@peepoople.com).\nPage 4 of 7\n\nfrustrated with the way PeePoo presented itself in the brochure, and how it kept saying that the\nbags were affordable without ever mentioning the actual price. A few thought the PeePoo's\nimpact was better than nothing, and liked the opportunity for income generation by selling the\nwaste as fertilizer. Someone else was concerned that the bags are made out of petroleum\nproducts, which may not be sustainable in the long-term. Many students in the class agreed that\nthe PeePoo may work better as a transition technology, with the eventual goal of putting in\nlatrines and sewer systems.\n\nPlayPump:\nMany students were amused that everyone says the PlayPump can make it less work to pump\nwater, since people still have to lift the same amount of water, plus now there is additional\nfriction and moment of inertia from the roundabout structure to take into account. It may be nice\nfor children to have something new to play on, but not if they have to \"play\" all day instead of\ngoing to school. If no children are around, how does the community pump water? There have\nbeen photos of women having to turn the heavy roundabout by hand instead. One student\nasked if the PlayPump could be hooked up to livestock instead? Another was concerned about\nthe high capital investment involved, particularly if the aquifer ends up running dry or the\ngroundwater ends up being contaminated like in Bangladesh where there is arsenic. Amy\nclarified that PlayPumps are typically installed where hand pumps are already being used with\nexisting naturally-replenishing aquifers, so people would have the same source of water for\nbetter or worse. Maintenance of the PlayPump is another issue, however, since many of the\nparts are specialized and may have to be shipped in. One person was relieved that at least it\nseems like user error with PlayPumps cannot really make the situation worse, unlike with the\nPeePoo bags. Someone else commented that this technology appears very inefficient with so\nmuch extra material, then was reminded that the image of having cute children running around\nis attractive to donors and the money is earned through advertising. PlayPumps may be\nconsidered hip, which is good for design magazines, but do they really work well for the\ncommunities that have them installed? People who are interested in learning more should watch\nthe following video update called \"Troubled Water,\" which shows the fate of PlayPumps now:\nhttp://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/southernafrica904/\nPage 5 of 7\n\nSchematic from the PlayPump website\n1) Roundabout 2) Borehole pump 3) Underground aquifer 4) Polyethelene tank 5) Tap\n6) Excess water (overflow) returned to borehole 7) Landscape billboard screen for advertising\n(c) PlayPumps.

For more information, see http://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nBelow are a few guiding questions within different dimensions of analysis, which we used in our\nclass discussion. Comments are in italics.\n\nTechnology:\n-\nDoes the technology work?\no If so, does the technology work all the time?\no Is it susceptible to user error?\n\nFor example, the PeePoo website says that people have to avoid\ntouching certain parts of the bag, which may be hard to do in practice.\n-\nDoes the technology address the problem?\no Sometimes a technology addresses the problem only partially for certain\nsituations. If this is the case, what aspects of the problem are addressed by the\ntechnology? What aspects are not addressed?\n-\nCan the technology be maintained locally?\no The PeePoo will need the right supply chain to be in place for distribution and\ncollection. People will be more incentivized to market the bags and help maintain\nthe system if they can make decent money from doing so.\nContext:\n-\nDoes using the technology require behavior change?\no This is one of the most difficult barriers to address for technology adoption,\nespecially if the behavior change requires more time or effort. People living in\npoverty are busy enough trying to survive and already have high demands on\ntheir time and limited resources. Remember how Bish said that some people\nPage 6 of 7\n\nPage 7 of 7\nchoose not to look for a job in the morning so that they will not have to eat as\nmuch that day. If they get a job, then they can eat more and work more, but\notherwise they have to conserve energy. There are many trade-offs to consider.\nTry to understand people's rational decision-making and their framework for\ndoing so.\nCost:\n-\nIs the technology affordable?\no PeePoo says it is aiming for a cost of 2-3 cents a bag, but projections are often\ntoo optimistic (take the example of the $100 laptop) so this could actually mean\n3-4 cents a bag. If we give them the benefit of the doubt and use a cost of 3\ncents in our estimates, this comes out to about $200 a year for a 5-person\nhousehold, which is actually enough to build a decent latrine. Remember to look\nat the numbers carefully because people can publicize statistics in a way that\nsounds more attractive.\no Let's try another example. PlayPumps cost about $7,000 each, according to their\npublicity, although the actual cost may be higher. Their average flow rate is\nsupposedly about 400 gallons per hour, which may sound high, but it seems\nmuch lower if you look at the per minute rate (which is less than a treadle pump's\nflow rate). Say an average person requires a 5 liter bucket of water each day.\nHow many people could a PlayPump support? What will the cost come out to be\nper person?\n-\nDoes the technology have recurring costs?\n-\nDoes the technology provide income? If so, for whom?\n\nThe case studies reminded us to be wary of anecdotal evidence. People tend to be polite, so we\ncannot always assume that they are giving real feedback. Someone being interviewed about the\nPeePoo is likely to say nice things about it if the interviewers are foreigners who came all the\nway to their community to bring these bags. Keeping this in mind, we need to be careful about\nmanaging the temptation to hype something up. Not only is it embarrassing if the hype turns out\nto be undeserved; the real negative impact is that it is irresponsible and can waste resources.\nPlayPumps received over $16 million, which could have gone to programs that worked. This\nwork is hard, and there have been many projects that got a lot of hype but did not quie deliver\non what was promised, such as the LifeStraw. Let's try to be humble and true about the way\nthat we share the work we are doing, instead of promoting an ethos of praising untested\ntechnologies. We can be excited and say that our design is awesome and works, if it is really\nawesome and really works. Better yet, we can focus our attention on working hard with our\ncommunity partners to have a better chance of building awesome projects that work well.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.701J / 11.025J / 11.472J D-Lab I: Development\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Teaching Note\nThis activity, framed as a role play to develop a community water system committee, is\nactually about gender issues. Students are told that they will be designing an improved\nwater system for a village and as part of the process must select a Water Development\nCommittee. In fact, the point of the exercise is for students to recognize that decision-\nmaking mechanisms often exclude uneducated, village women who are most affected\nby these decisions. It's important to present a session on water before this exercise so\nthat the context of the role play makes sense, and that the students have been exposed\nto the fact that water is overwhelmingly a women's issue.\nStart the activity by explaining the assignment: designing improvements to a community\nwater system. The students will form groups, create a Water Development Committee\nand then each student will take on one of the roles of the committee. They will need to\nfill in the role play worksheet during class and turn it in at the end of the session. Finally\ntell them that they will take on these roles in a negotiation session during the next class\nin order to come up with a proposal for improvements to their village water supply\nsystem.\nStudents should be divided into groups of five or six and given the assignment packet.\nThey will need about ten minutes to read through the material, and then take another\nfifteen minutes to discuss who should be on the water committee. Following that, they\nshould decide who will play each role, and take about fifteen to twenty minutes to fill in\nthe role play worksheet. If there is time remaining, they can begin the negotiation\nsession.\nDuring the second class, rather than run the negotiation session, you should discuss\nwho they chose to be on the committee and why. To facilitate discussion and help\nstudents remember and compare whom they selected, you can project a table like\nTable 1 on a PowerPoint slide that shows the people they selected for each group.\nEach column is a committee, with the D-Lab student in italics on the bottom row.\nTable 1: Initial Table\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 Group 5 Group 6\nAgnes\nKabelo\nAgnes\nAgnes\nAgnes\nKabelo\nKabelo\nMary\nKabelo\nMetheo\nKabelo\nMetheo\nMetheo Metheo Metheo\nMpho\nMetheo\nMpho\nPer\nMpho\nPer\nPer\nMpho\nPeter\nPeter\nAshley\nAimee Christina\nIrene\nRob\nJessica\n\nAfter the initial discussion, confess that this wasn't really a role play about water, it was\na role play about gender issues. Show Table II, where men are shaded, to show how\nmany women were on the committees (female D-Lab students are shaded lightly\nbecause it was coincidental that they were women, rather than intentional).\nTable II: Genders Highlighted\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 Group 5 Group 6\nMetheo Metheo\nKabelo\nMetheo\nPeter\nMpho\nPeter\nMpho\nAgnes\nMpho\nMpho\nKabelo\nAgnes\nMary\nPer\nPer\nKabelo\nMetheo\nPer\nKabelo\nMetheo\nAgnes\nMetheo\nAgnes\nKabelo\nAgnes\nAshley\nAimee Christina\nIrene\nJessica\nYou can also show a table like Table III, that shades in the people who were not actually\nfrom the village, leaving the truly local participants. It is interesting to note that in many\ncultures, even though someone has lived in the village for many years, there are many\nreasons why they will continue to be considered to be outsiders--tribal affiliations,\nlanguage barriers, etc.\nTable III: Local Committee Members Highlighted\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 Group 5 Group 6\nMetheo Metheo\nKabelo\nMetheo\nPeter\nMpho\nPeter\nMpho\nAgnes\nMpho\nMpho\nKabelo\nAgnes\nMary\nPer\nPer\nKabelo\nMetheo\nPer\nKabelo\nMetheo\nAgnes\nMetheo\nAgnes\nKabelo\nAgnes\nAshley\nAimee Christina\nIrene\nJessica\nTable IV, the final table, shows how many local women were selected for the\ncommittee.\nTable IV: Local Female Committee Members Highlighted\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 Group 5 Group 6\nMetheo Metheo\nKabelo\nMetheo\nPeter\nMpho\nPeter\nMpho\nAgnes\nMpho\nMpho\nKabelo\n\nAgnes\nMary\nPer\nPer\nKabelo\nMetheo\nPer\nKabelo\nMetheo\nAgnes\nMetheo\nKabelo\nAgnes\nAshley\nAimee Christina\nIrene\nJessica\nFrom this point on, it's important that the discussion not take on an accusatory tone, so\nthat students don't tune out and instead learn from their choices and recognize how\neasy it is for this exclusion to happen. Students may claim that it is unfair, because\nthere were not many local women on the list. I emphasize that, as D-Lab students, they\nwill be introduced to a variety of people within the community but they should be aware\nthat the people they meet are just a small subset of those who live in the village, and\nthat extra effort may be needed to ensure that there is adequate representation. For\nthis exercise, students may need to choose people who are not on the list in order to\nexert that extra effort. It is also worthwhile to mention that language and education tend\nto be additional barriers to women's participation and therefore it is important that\nstudents account for this as well. You could assign homework following this assignment,\nreflecting on the exercise and addressing the issue of how to encourage inclusion so\nthat all parties are involved in the decision-making process.\n\nVillage Water System Planning\nFall 2009\nYou are on a D-Lab team working to design a water system for a small village in rural\nBotswana. Your job is to assemble a Water Development Committee, assess the\nvillage water resources and design a system that will improve access to safe water.\nThe following is a description of the village where you will be working.\nMetsi a Mangwe, Kweneg District, Botswana\nOfficial Languages: Setswana, English\nLatitude: -25o 10' Longitude: 22o 35'\nTime Zone: GMT +2\nMetsi a Mangwe is a small village in eastern Botswana in the Kweneng district, about\n100 km northwest of Molepolole. There are 400 households, each comprised of several\nrondavels, that make up the family compound. In the village, there are four primary\nschools and one Junior Secondary School. At the end of Junior Secondary School,\nstudents take the Junior Certificate Exam, and if they pass, they can attend Senior\nSecondary School, usually in Molepolole, which is the capitol of the Kweneng district.\nThe land surrounding Metsi a Mangwe is primarily divided into ―the lands‖ where women\ngrow maize, sorghum, beans and melons, and small cattle posts, where the men keep\nthe cattle. Most families in Kweneng have three homes--one in the village, one at the\nlands and one at the cattle post. The landscape is primarily desert scrub. At the lands,\nthey practice rain-fed agriculture as there is no irrigation, but in the eastern part of the\ncountry there is usually enough rain during the rainy season (November - March) for at\nleast part of the crop to be successful. Farther from the village, most of the land is tribal\ngrazing land without clear ownership; young boys usually keep track of the herds and\nbring them back to their cattle posts when necessary. Livestock is a very important part\nof Setwana culture and is a measure of wealth. There are three times as many cattle as\npeople and twice as many goats as cattle. The cattle are primarily kept at the cattle\nposts, where they are allowed to freely roam and graze; the goats are dispersed\nthroughout the cattle posts and the village.\nThere is a small river that along the eastern side of the village, it is a seasonal river that\nruns only for about five months of the year. People within easy walking distance of the\nriver use it as a source of water for their household needs; otherwise, water in the\nvillage is provided through five government-installed boreholes that reach into a water\ntable approximately sixty meters below the surface. Each borehole has a single tap,\nwhich serves about eighty families. Some compounds are more than two kilometers\nfrom the closest tap. There is also a borehole at the Junior Secondary School, which\nprovides water for the teachers' quarters and the school garden. Farther from the\nvillage, some of the wealthier members of the village have installed wind-powered\n\npumps to supply their cattle with water. The seasonal rains, if they come, arrive in\nNovember and fall sporadically until mid-March.\nIf the rains are good, the desert\nbecomes a grassland; if not, only the acacia shrubs are green. During the rainy season,\nwater accumulates in large puddles called pans; these often last a few months into the\ndry season, but rarely until the beginning of the next rainy season. When the rains are\nespecially heavy, the roads become impassable and take up to a week to dry out, but\nthere are alternative routes, so the village is not completely cut off. The village is about\n100 km from Molepolole on a road where the first half is paved and the rest is a well-\ntraveled but poorly maintained track. Transport of supplies into the village can be\nexpensive, depending on the time of year, as only the most rugged items and vehicles\nsurvive the journey intact.\nApart from teachers and civil servants, few people in this area have formal employment:\nsome make crafts, a couple of people have small stores or bars that sell necessities and\nserve as a social gathering place. There are a few skilled craftsmen--a metal worker,\ntwo carpenters and a mason--who are self-employed and make a good living for\nthemselves.\nReligion is important in Metsi a Mangwe: there are several different\ndenominations, but only three churches have their own buildings. Many of the churches\nconduct services at the compound of one of the members of the congregation. There\nare a few extension agents and government officers who work in Metsi a Mangwe, but\nthe district headquarters are in Molepolole and most services are provided by these\noffices, as they are relatively close. There is a post office and most people who have\nsavings invest it in the Post Bank as there are no bank branches in the village.\nWhen considering a water system for this community, it is important to consider the\ncapital resources of the community. Livestock is the traditional measure of wealth and\nmost people would rather invest in a cow than a bank. As such, cash is only available\nin small quantities and saving and investment in money is uncommon. Bank loans are\navailable at a 15% interest rate, though few people apply for them. Typically, if one\nwants to buy something of high value, the first step to buying it is to sell a cow or goat.\nThe Botswana Meat Commission provides a high price for livestock as part of a\nEuropean Union aid package, though transport to the abattoir takes about 10% of the\nprofits. The government has recently started a program where villages can apply for\ngrants of up to P 200,000 (the unit of currency is the pula, which is Setswana for ―rain‖)\nto augment their water systems. It costs P 25,000 to drill a borehole and install a tap. It\ncosts an average of P 50 per meter to install a pipeline to distribute water from the tap\nto the surrounding area. In general, additional requirements can be approximated at\n30% higher than prices in South Africa.\n\nWater Development Committee\nFall 2009\nThe following are some members of the community that you have met and may choose\nto have on your Water Development Committee.\nYour first job is to select the\ncommittee. As a group, decide who you will invite to be on the committee. Once you\nhave selected the committee, each of you will be responsible for learning and playing\nthe role of one of the members: studying your role, preparing the Role Play Worksheet\nto develop your understanding of the role, and playing it in character during the\nnegotiations during the next class. One of you will be the D-Lab student who is helping\nthe village apply for the government funding for the project; the rest of the group will be\nthe other people who make up the committee.\nMetheo Borolong is the chief of the village. He was born in Metsi a Mangwe but was\neducated at a government school in Molepolole, followed by private school in\nGaborone. He has not attended university but values education and has advocated for\nthe construction of two primary schools and a junior secondary school in the village.\nFifteen years ago, he took over responsibility as chief from his uncle. Despite taking on\nthe role at the young age of thirty-seven, he has earned the respect of the villagers\nthrough the programs that he has brought to the village. He is wealthy by Botswana\nstandards--owning 120 cattle and 200 goats, as well as a new Toyota Hi-Lux pick-up\ntruck.\nBoitumelo Borolong is the chief's wife. She lives with her husband and seven children\nin the chief's compound, which is in the center of the village. She attended primary\nschool in Metsi a Mangwe and junior secondary school in Molepolole. She is on the\nboard of the junior secondary school and is very active in the community.\nGeorge Nyamagure is the headmaster of the local Junior Secondary School. He is\none of the few people in Metsi a Mangwe to attend the University of Botswana in\nGaborone, where he studied education and literature. He lives on the school campus\nwith his wife, four children and his elderly mother. He has a reputation among students\nof being very strict but fair, and everyone who graduates from his school remembers\nhim fondly as an excellent teacher and administrator.\nPeter Kalanga runs a small metal-working shop on the edge of the village. He is a\nZimbabwean refugee, who moved to Botswana with his family during the instability in\nthe early 80's. He is well-educated and speaks excellent English; his workshop is\nknown for its high quality work. Every few years, he hires students who graduate from\nthe junior secondary school to serve as apprentices in the shop. In addition to the metal\nshop, he owns a small general store in the front of his compound which is run by his\noldest daughter. He gets his supplies for the shop from Gaborone and Molepolole,\nwhich arrive on a weekly delivery truck.\n\nAgnes Modimo is the leader of the women's group in Metsi a Mangwe. She is married\nto the pastor of the United Church of Christ, which is the largest church in the village.\nShe was born in Francistown and moved to Metsi a Mangwe to be with her husband\nforty years ago. She founded the women's group twenty-five years ago and has been a\ndynamic leader of the group, which now has over seventy members.\nShe is a\nproponent of women's rights, but still holds strongly to her traditional beliefs, though she\nis more progressive than many of the other women her age. She attended senior\nsecondary school at a time when few girls continued their education to this level; she\nwas the top student at her school, but did not go to university.\nGabriel Modimo is the pastor of the United Church of Christ, the largest church in Metsi\na Mangwe. He is one of the most highly respected elders in the village. He was born\nand raised in Metsi a Mangwe and has spent his whole life there with the exception of\ntwo years at the seminary. In addition to dynamic preaching, he is known for his\npastoral outreach and concern for the members of his congregation. He supports many\nprojects that help his parishioners including a sewing school and a day care that are run\nin the church building during the week.\nBrett Anderson is a Peace Corps Volunteer from rural Montana. He went to a large\nstate school and studied accounting before deciding that he wanted to have a better\nunderstanding of other parts of the world and make contributions wherever he could.\nHe arrived in Botswana three months ago, and the Metsi a Mangwe area will be his\nhome for the next two years. His family grew corn and wheat in Montana and Brett\nwants to work in agricultural management when he returns to the United States.\nAlthough he comes from a very isolated area and has had limited exposure to other\ncultures, most people have really taken to Brett because of his curiosity and willingness\nto ask questions and experience village life first-hand.\nHe was in the advanced\nSetswana group during his Peace Corps training and has a knack for learning new\nlanguages.\nIn addition to his primary assignment to promote village horticulture\nprojects, he is looking for secondary projects to work on.\nMpho Temothuo is the agriculture teacher at the junior secondary school. He speaks\nexcellent English and is a charismatic young man who is well-liked throughout the\ncommunity. He lives in school housing with his wife and three small children. He\nattended Botswana Agricultural College where he specialized in horticulture and\nbeekeeping.\nHe was born near Francistown (Botswana's second largest city) but\nenjoys the village life in Metsi a Mangwe. He is a favorite teacher at the school due to\nhis energy and enthusiasm. The school garden is productive and sells vegetables to\nraise money for equipment for the school football (soccer) and netball teams. Each\nyear, his students earn outstanding marks on the agriculture practicals for the Junior\nCertificate exams. He is friends with the agricultural extension worker that is stationed\nin Molepolole and they are working together to start a community horticulture project in\nthe village.\n\nMary Dintwa is a nurse at the clinic on the edge of town. She often sees patients from\nMetsi a Mangwe and nearby areas who are ill from water-borne diseases but many\ntimes cannot give any treatment beyond recommendations for better water practices\nbecause medicine is short in supply and very expensive for the villagers. She was born\nin the Tsabong district of Botswana, in the southwest, but traveled a lot within the\ncountry as a young girl and speaks several of the local languages. However, her\nEnglish is not very good and she prefers to communicate through other people rather\nthan to make an attempt with her limited skills.\nPer Vand is a Danish volunteer who works for Water for Humanity. He spent six years\ninstalling village water systems in Cambodia and three years installing systems in\nRwanda before coming to Botswana six months ago. He is on a five-year contract with\nthe Danish government to assist with implementing the new village water system\naugmentation program and is the representative for the Kweneng district. He lives in a\ngovernment-issue house on the outskirts of Molepolole on the road that leads to Metsi a\nMangwe.\nKabelo Mothibi is a long-time Department of Water and Sanitation worker with the\nnational government of Botswana. He grew up in Gaborone and keeps his office there\nbut visits the rural districts throughout the year to check on any infrastructure problems\nand to train local maintenance crews, where applicable. His visits are eagerly awaited\nbecause they bring connections to the resources and knowledge available at the\nnational level. He started university with a specialization in biology but was forced to\nwithdraw because his academic performance was not strong enough to maintain his\nscholarship.\n\nWater Role Play Worksheet\nFall 2009\nWhat is your MIT name?\nWho else is on your team?\nWhat is your Setswana name?\nWhat is your role in the Metsi a Mangwe community?\nBased on the information you have or can infer from your position in the community,\nwhat are your top priorities in this process?

      "content": "D-Lab: Development\nSP.721 Fall 2009\nIntroduction & World Facts Quiz\nClass Outline for September 9, 2009:\n-\nIntroduction\n-\nCourse Overview\n-\nExamples of D-Lab Projects\n-\nWorld Facts Quiz\nStaff Introductions:\nAmy Smith is the instructor and founder of D-Lab. She majored in mechanical engineering\nat MIT as an undergraduate, but felt unsatisfied learning mostly about cars and bombs. After\ngraduation, she joined the Peace Corps in Botswana for 4 years, serving as a teacher and\nbeekeeper. Amy realized that she missed design and engineering, however, so she returned\nto MIT to study and teach design for development. She believes that what underlies design\nfor the developing world - simplicity, reliability, low-cost, ease of use - is true of all good\nengineering. Amy feels lucky to be teaching the class she always wished she could take\nwhen she was a student at MIT. In this class, she will share things she learned over the\nyears and things she wished she knew while she was in the Peace Corps and doing other\nfieldwork.\nProfessor Bish Sanyal joined D-Lab 3 years ago, when he first heard about Amy in a New\nYork Times article. He is from the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP),\nwhere the approach is more theoretical. DUSP looks at technological change on a macro\nlevel, so he appreciates D-Lab's grassroots approach. Many in this field were\ndisenfranchised with theory and how things were not happening on the ground, which led to\nthe early movement for appropriate technology. Bish grew up in India and was trained in\narchitecture, eventually working for his dad as a project manager building bridges in Asia.\nWhen he saw that construction workers were men, women and even children with volatile\nlives where they sometimes did not receive pay, he lost interest in this work and turned to\neconomic development, focusing on how to provide jobs, housing and other necessities.\nAround this time was the Leftist movement in India and a major strike, so it was a good time\nto go to graduate school. One of his projects was in Zambia, where his first assignment was\nPage 1 of 4\n\nto figure out why people were not paying for housing sponsored by World Bank loans. Bish\nbecame interested in urban planning and joined MIT as an assistant professor in 1984,\neventually rising to department head and chair of faculty. Now he is teaching with Amy and\nwill be bringing a little development theory to help the class consider the larger scope of\ndevelopment.\nVictor Grau Serrat is a D-Lab instructor who co-teaches D-Lab: Development, D-Lab:\nDesign and D-Lab: ICT (information and communication technologies). His undergraduate\nstudies were in electrical engineering and computer science in Spain. Victor then came to\nthe US for a Master's degree at the University of Maryland, completing a thesis on a very\ntheoretical topic. He wanted to be more hands-on, so then he went to teach and live in a\npoor neighborhood of the 2nd largest city in Bolivia. This is where he realized he could\ncombine his skills and interests to work on ICTs for the developing world. Victor worked at\none of his dream jobs, doing projects all over the world, and is now teaching with Amy. He\nhas also started his own class on ICTs for development.\nDerek Brine is the Teaching Assistant and resident environmental engineer. He has worked\nin Kenya, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, and China. He will be leading an IAP trip and will be in\ncharge of grades.\nDennis Nagle is the D-Lab workshop manager. He teaches appropriate tools for\nappropriate technology, such as how to use a hammer, chisel and hacksaw.\nNate & Jess are the newest members of the D-Lab staff. Nate studied product design at the\nArt Center College of Design in Pasadena, while Jess studied civil engineering and business\nat the University of California, Berkeley. They will be taking notes in class for Open Course\nWare and leading IAP trips in January.\nPaula Cogliano is the course administrator.\nHistory of D-Lab:\nThe program started in 2002 with only 10 students. The first class, called The Haiti Class, was\n(not surprisingly) focused on Haiti and taught in collaboration with the Haitian Students Alliance,\nwho wanted to work on projects in their home country but involve more of the MIT community.\nPrior to The Haiti Class, Amy had been teaching on Designs\nfor Developing Countries, but without a particular geographical\nfocus. The next year, students from India and Brazil became\ninterested in being part of the class, but they couldn't call it\nThe Haiti-India-Brazil Class, so they came up with the name of\nD-Lab. There happen to be many words starting with the letter\n\"d\" that reflect the spirit of our program, such as development,\ndesign, dissemination, dialogue, and discovery. D-Lab has\nsince grown to reaching over 200 students a year and\ndeploying projects in over 20 countries. By the 2010-11\nacademic year, D-Lab will have a suite of over 12 class\nofferings.\nSince the class is oversubscribed, students that do not make it into this class by lottery may\nconsider taking another class in the D-Lab family being offered this fall, such as Development\nVentures, D-Lab: ICT, or D-Lab: Cycle Ventures. There are another 6 D-Lab classes offered in\nthe spring (D-Lab: Design, D-Lab: Dissemination, D-Lab: Health, D-Lab: Energy, Wheelchair\nDesign for Developing Countries, and Developing World Prosthetics).\nPage 2 of 4\n\nCourse Overview:\nThis course aims to build awareness of development issues and appropriate technologies,\ndeveloping both hands-on skills and theoretical background. A unique part of the course is an\noptional fieldwork trip over the January IAP session, where students have an opportunity to\nwork on a variety of projects, learn from rural communities firsthand and engage in cultural\nsharing.\nThe class will consist of lectures, guest speakers (including William Kamkwamba, a self-taught\nwindmill maker from Malawi, and world experts in a variety of fields), hands-on activities and lab\nsessions (such as using agricultural processing equipment, testing water for contaminants and\nbuilding a concrete latrine slab), team projects, and area studies to prepare for the trips. Class\ntopics, ranging from energy to microfinance, will be divided into short modules, with dual foci on\ntheory and practical solutions.\nD-Lab has a strong emphasis on experiential learning. Students will be building skills that\nenable them to do something practical and enact real change over the IAP trip, like building a\nwater treatment system for a community. Amy jokes that if anyone dislikes working with\ncharcoal, he or she should think about dropping the class as D-Lab does a lot work on making\ncharcoal out of agricultural waste.\nProjects do not all require engineering, and often involve\nwork in education, health and nutrition, microenterprise,\nand other fields. Students will be forming country teams in\na few weeks and will choose projects with their team and\ncommunity partners. The team may choose to focus on\none project or split up to work on multiple projects. Each\nstudent will bring their own expertise, but everyone needs\nto be careful not to force their interest if it has no\napplication to the partner community. Most importantly,\nstudents are encouraged to be personally engaged. Many\nstudents will bring their own passion and do projects\nbased on personal interest, in addition to class projects.\nQ: Does D-Lab go back to the same work sites every year?\nA: D-Lab does often return to the same community site but with evolved projects. Students\nmay continue working on their project through another D-Lab class or a fellowship to work\nwith the community partner over the summer. Often the community partners learn more\nabout what D-Lab is capable of and will ask for assistance with different projects. For\nexample, Victor worked with an organization in Honduras that was mostly focused on\nbuilding techniques, but they wanted to learn more about biogas so they requested that MIT\nstudents help with the research for a pilot.\nExamples of D-Lab Projects:\nPerhaps one of the most successful examples is a pedal power project that has grown into a\nviable company, Global Cycle Solutions (GCS). GCS was founded by D-Lab student Jodie Wu,\nwho took several classes from the D-Lab family suite of classes and developed a pedal-\npowered maize sheller and grinder. Jodie was introduced to D-Lab through the Wheelchair\nDesign for Developing Countries. In January 2008, after being inspired by Maya Pedal's pedal-\npowered technologies in Guatemala, she traveled to Tanzania as part of D-Lab: Development\nwith a vision to bring adapted pedal-power technologies to communities that could use them.\nShe expected wide impact with these devices, but upon reaching the field, she realized that the\nstationary technology she brought was designed for another context and she needed to make it\nPage 3 of 4\n\nmore affordable and portable in order to reach the rural communities who needed it most. Jodie\nwanted to make a pedal-powered sheller that was accessible to the many villagers who were\nstill shelling maize by hand, a process that typically takes weeks, pulling children out of school\nas food for the family often takesprecedence over education.\nIn response to these challenges, in spring 2008, Jodie\nworked on a team in D-Lab: Design to develop a modified\nmaize sheller peripheral that attaches to a bicycle without\naltering its functionality. That summer, Jodie traveled to\nfarms and villages in Arusha, Tanzania and watched as\nthis novel implementation of a simple yet valuable\ntechnology became a powerful income generation\nopportunity for the entrepreneur, earning positive returns\nwithin one week. The device not only shelled maize 40\ntimes faster than by hand, but it also brought an affordable\nservice that saved rural villagers from arduous manual\nlabor.\nA\nformerly\nunaffordabledevice became an opportunity for enterprise. Jodie worked\nwith teams in D-Lab: Dissemination and Development Ventures to develop the business model\nfor Global Cycle Solutions, a company that would produce and sell the pedal-powered devices\nto get them into the hands of as many users as possible.\nToday, GCS is continuing to develop its universal adapter and bicycle peripheral devices, and\ncreating a sustainable business model to disseminate their family of technologies to rural\ncommunities all over the world. GCS has since won several competitions, including the\nDevelopment Track and Audience Choice Award at the MIT $100K Business Plan Competition,\nand successfully fundraised over $200,000 for their operations. Jodie has deferred a full\nscholarship to graduate school at Berkeley to launch GCS in Tanzania.\nWorld Facts Quiz:\nThis in-class exercise is an interactive introduction to international development. Students are\nusually shocked to find out the statistics representing conditions today.\nAt the end of class, interested students can fill in application forms to enter the class lottery\nsystem. The MIT Service Fair is taking place immediately afterward from 5-6:30pm in Lobby 13,\nwhere students will be able to explore additional local and international service opportunities.\nDevelopment through Dialogue, Design & Dissemination\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.701J / 11.025J / 11.472J D-Lab I: Development\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

It brings issues to the students' attention in an extremely interactive way\nand allows you to focus on topics or technologies of particular interest to your class.\nThe order in which you present the answers can be very important, especially when there is a\nlist of data from several countries, as the stark contrasts between countries can increase the\nimpact of the information presented.\nI usually follow the quiz with a brief description of some technologies that address the problems\nthat are highlighted by the quiz: the sari cloth water filter, the pot-in-pot evaporative cooling\nsystem, the Light Up The World Foundation solid-state lights, and the Grameen phone. These\nexamples also show the range of what is considered to be \"appropriate\" in today's context.\nA good follow-up reading is the New York Times article Kofi Annan's Astonishing Facts, by\nBarbara Crosette (September 27, 1998).\nUnless otherwise indicated, the quiz uses data from the World Development Indicators by the\nWorld Bank.

      "content": "D-Lab: Development\nSP.721 Fall 2009\nStakeholder Analysis & Participation\nClass Outline for September 11, 2009:\n-\nClass Introductions\n-\nStakeholder Roleplay: Wheelchairs for the Developing World\n-\nThe D-Lab Philosophy\nClass Introductions:\nOne of the most important things about D-Lab is the community that develops within this class.\nFor the class introductions, everyone goes around saying at least 1 interesting thing about\nhimself or herself that is unknown to most other people. Amy's interesting thing is that she is a\ndirect descendant of the Mary who had a little lamb from the childhood song - hands-on\neducation runs in her family.\nStakeholder Roleplay: Wheelchairs for the Developing World\nTo kick off a discussion on the relationships between different stakeholders in development,\nstudents participate in a roleplaying activity as donors, providers, manufacturers and users of\nwheelchairs. Each student receives a color-coded role information sheet, and begins by meeting\nwith others playing the same role to discuss and fully understand their position. After making\nsure everyone is on the same page, the students group themselves by color so that each role is\nrepresented. Everyone introduces their role (keeping their objectives and special instructions to\nthemselves) before beginning the negotiations. Different roles can ask each other questions to\nlearn more about the situation and people involved. Some teams may find it difficult to come to\na consensus and decide how to proceed.\nDuring the debrief, several students comment that there were a lot of things that they wanted to\nsay during the discussion, but could not, due to special constraints placed on their role limiting\ntheir interactions with the rest of the group. Another student shares that she did not feel useful,\nas she wasn't asked to share any useful information that she did have and did not have answers\nto the questions she was asked. Amy clarifies that the roles are set up in a particular way to\nsimulate the complexities and limitations in real negotiations, so no one should feel guilty about\nplaying their role. For example, some roles are not supposed to volunteer any information, but\nonly answer direct questions, as there are cultural differences with communication and sharing\ninformation. Some students playing these types of roles may became frustrated if they were\noverlooked by the more vocal positions during the discussion.\nThe time allotted for the roleplay is also very short, so there is not a lot of time for teams to\nshare information, discuss and make a decision. One group believes that crucial pieces of\ninformation did not come through in their discussion, making it harder for them to come to a\nPage 1 of 5\n\nconsensus when they could not figure out everyone's motivations and interests. A group may\nhave the same goal, but may not realize it or may struggle to find a way to achieve it. People\nare passionate about their own approaches, so they may even view other approaches as\nchallenging rather than collaborative, even though development is supposedly a collaborative\nfield. There can be blinders when people are so driven by a mission or passion. For instance,\nthose who are giving money may not always have the complete picture, sometimes hearing just\na few things and becoming focused on them before hearing from all the stakeholders\n(particularly the users).\nMany students admit that they got a little creative and ended up breaking out of the expectations\nof the role to find a solution. It's important to start with the rules of the roleplay as a guide, but\nyou do not have to let the roles define you. About a third to a half of the students playing the\nNGO management role, users or parents followed the special instruction to refrain from speak\nfreely and only answer direct questions. It is not always common for a wheelchair user to be\npresent during a decision-making meeting, but even when they are, they may not volunteer\ninformation as freely. Some of this may be cultural - at the International Development Design\nSummit in Ghana this past summer, Amy noticed that students from the US participated a lot\nwhile their Ghanaian teammates could barely get in a word, even though they knew the most\nabout the context of the projects. Western students are often trained to volunteer their opinions\nall the time, compared to people from elsewhere who may have more relevant information but\nmay not have as many opportunities to share it and tend to be more soft-spoken. It is an\ninteresting dynamic.\nStudents talk about how they struggled between a moral standpoint or keeping their job. One\nrole in particular has indicators and performance goals (a certain number of wheelchairs) that\nare supposed to be met for their company, but feedback from users has been that those chairs\nare not particularly useful. A student shares that they felt bad about pushing hard about the\nmoney, but they were representing someone who did not want to see their organization die off.\nIt can be complex when people's livelihoods depend on certain funders, who may be more\nmotivated by short-term incentives to show growth than long-term sustainable impact support\nlivelihoods. In one group meeting, the discussion almost became a contest for who could give\nthe most eloquent argument to the funder and throw out the most supporting numbers, while the\nwheelchair user and parents felt more like spectators and were less empowered to participate.\nThink about what it takes to really create a level playing field for negotiation. There may be a lot\nof unbalances with power and social status.\nPage 2 of 5\n\nIn the real world, places are often littered with broken wheelchairs - not only are there\nwheelchairs that break after a few months, but there are even chairs that cause physical harm\n(that can lead to sores and eventually even death) - yet people are still pushing them out,\nbecause the incentive is to send more chairs out rather than making sure that we are sending\ngood quality chairs. Someone may hold a fundraiser here, for example, to raise money to ship\nused wheelchairs from the US to people living in poor communities of Guatemala. At first\nglance, this might seem like a worthy cause, but it is important to try to find out more about the\nsituation before deciding to support it. Are the chairs appropriate for the intended use? How\nrobust are the chairs and could they be fixed in Guatemala, or do they contain fragile\nspecialized parts with no locally available replacements?\nIn this class, D-Lab does not want students to develop a jaded mentality, but rather a healthy\nand realistic skepticism that takes into account the complexity of the situation and tries to figure\nout what may be the best solution for sustainable, long-term impact. It often helps to start by\nlooking at something that has worked a little better than other programs, and then build on it. No\none really knows what the best answer is, necessarily.\nThe D-Lab Philosophy:\nBefore getting too far into the semester, Amy wants to get into the D-Lab philosophy a little to\ngive students a sense of where this approach comes from. [Please Note: It is not easy to\ncapture and represent this philosophy well through written notes, so readers are encouraged to\ntake a look at the D-Lab website (http://d-lab.mit.edu) for more details. A video of Amy speaking\non the D-Lab philosophy will eventually be posted online, as part of a library of resources\nentitled \"D-Clips.\"]\nWhat does the \"D\" in D-Lab stand for? What are some of our guiding principles?\nDevelopment: the belief that development actually can happen and that there are\nsustainable ways for communities to go about it\nDesign: technologies can have a role in improving people's lives\nDissemination: technologies alone cannot have an impact, however - we need to get these\ntechnologies into the hands of users\nDialogue & Discovery: emphasis on learning from people who have more direct\ninteractions with the users or from the users themselves (D-Lab teams don't have the hubris\nto believe that they can make the most effective lasting change over a single IAP January\nperiod, but it is important to go and talk to people and try to experience life in the region\nfirsthand, rather than just reading about it, to get a sense of what people's needs are)\nNot everything that D-Lab values has to start with a \"D\" (this is not Sesame Street):\nRespect: it is really important to respect the communities we are working with to truly work\ntogether (realize that education and intelligence have very little to do with each other - some\nof the smartest people you meet may never have attended primary school, so we need to\nshake up our preconceptions coming from MIT), but also remember to respect your own\ncapabilities and offer to contribute in ways that you are able\nHumility: recognize that there are also issues in our own society and be open to learning (a\nstudent once said they wanted to \"show people how to live,\" which is not what D-Lab is\nabout)\nPage 3 of 5\n\nOptimism, Idealism & Enthusiasm: these are what keep people in this field going, as\ndevelopment work is not easy - we do not want to discourage people from thinking they can\nmake a difference, but we want people to think about how they can do it in a sustainable\nway (Amy is proud that she left the Peace Corps as idealistic as when she started, which is\nconsidered fairly rare)\n\"The real optimist sees even an empty glass as half full \" - Amy Smith\nWe should remember to be idealistic, to do the work in the best way that we can think of,\nand to do it with enthusiasm.\nAmy goes on to describe her transformative work in a refugee camp in Uganda. One of the most\nbrutal violent conflicts occurred in northern Uganda, and communities are starting to move back\nto their villages after 20-25 years in refugee camps. Amy was invited to work with these\ncommunities to show them technologies that could be useful and ease this transition. When she\nvisited with a graduate student named Kofi, they found that there were not a lot of workshops,\naccess to local blacksmiths, and such, so they decided to just teach everyone how to make corn\nshellers on their own. Amy and Kofi were excited to see how people got really engaged - even\npeople who have never worked with metal before or thought of themselves as makers. When\nthey returned the next day, there were stacks of nicely-made corn shellers that were being sold\nat half price within the community, and at full price to neighboring communities. This experience\nhas solidified Amy's belief that we can work with communities in a respectful way, really\nbelieving in the capacity of people to make technologies to impact their own lives.\nD-Lab wants to build the creative capacity of communities, changing the paradigm so that\npeople feel empowered to build their own technologies, instead of having the expectation of\nbeing merely recipients of technologies. This is a very exciting and revolutionary methodology\nthat D-Lab is actively promoting, and it goes against how a lot of development work has been\ndone historically. A few groups are also taking a similar approach - Whirlwind Wheelchair has\nwheelchairs users actually designing and building their own chairs. D-Lab asks students to be\nopen to experiencing this and to bring their enthusiasm, interest and willingness to work with\npeople. Bring your nerdiness! Jump in and try to learn and experiment and do something. In\nGhana, the D-Lab team tried to build a well together with the community despite the fact that no\none had done so before, but everyone jumped right in and got muddy and worked hard together\n- and they made it!\n\"You cannot do this work if you fear mud\" - John Manu\nAlso, do not expect people to do things for you. When a D-Lab team needed wood for\ndemonstration, the students just took axes and chopped their own wood, even though the men\nin the community were more than willing to help. It should be part of the D-Lab ethos to clean-up\nafter yourself. After a community demonstration, the team took straw and helped to sweep up\nthe community space so they would not leave extra work for the women. Be willing to take\ninitiative to help out and do things - not only is it the right thing to do, but you will learn a lot in\nthe process. [Amy takes this opportunity to point out to the class that they have might noticed\nhow the regular rows of chairs and tables got displaced during the group activity, so students\nshould feel free to jump in and help rearrange the classroom afterward.]\nFinally, it is always important to think carefully about what you are asking people to do,\nespecially when you are working with people who are living under $2 a day. Are you asking\nPage 4 of 5\n\npeople to risk their entire crop by trying a new technology, which may still be at the stage of an\nuntested prototype? You cannot just say, \"oh, maybe this will work if you put raisins in the soil.\"\nThese are just some of the useful ways you can think about approaching development work.\nThere may be a naivete in this approach, but there is also a strength in believing in your ability\nto do good. D-Lab is challenging students to look at all these different dimensions, not to\ndiscourage them, but to empower them to take action in a positive way.\nThe class discussion on stakeholder analysis will continue next Monday.\nDevelopment through Dialogue, Design & Dissemination\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.701J / 11.025J / 11.472J D-Lab I: Development\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Fall 2009\nVillage Profile\n\nAtsungiumajurniapaa, Nunavut\nLatitude: 67° 06' 07 North: Longitude: 87° 18' 09 West\nTime Zone: GMT-5 (1 hr behind EST) -\n\nAtsungiumajurniapaa, Nunavut is a remote Inuit Community of about 200 people\nlocated just above the Arctic Circle in the Canadian North. It is regionally accessible\nonly by airplane and sealift and only for the summer months of June to August. After\narriving by boat or plane in Naujat (Repulse Bay), one must travel 100km northeast by\nsnow- or dogsled to reach the community. Naujat is the closet community with an\nindependent electricity generating facility, and its grid is unavailable for extension.\n\nThe people of Atsungiumajurniapaa live traditionally. They hunt seal, narwhal and\ncaribou and herd reindeer. These are their main source of sustenance. The community\nhas a herd of about 60 reindeer, which is actually unusual for a North-American Arctic\ncommunity. A quick-flowing stream provides access to the bay from July to August, but\nquickly ices off at the beginning of October. During the winter months pack-ice makes\ntraditional sea navigation impossible and hunters from the community typically hunt for\nseal at their airholes. Moreover since their village is located above the Arctic treeline,\ncommunity members' intake of vegetables is limited to some of the edible scrub bushes,\ngrasses and tubers that grow nearby in the summer months and to high-cost imported\nvegetables from the South. Tomatoes, for example, can cost over $15 US per kg.\n\nThe environment around Atsungiumajurniapaa is true arctic tundra; a vast plane on\nthree sides and a protected bay on the fourth. Precipitation during the year is limited to\nonly 10-20 mm of snow and drizzle, however a strong breeze constantly whips up loose\nsnow almost year-round, giving the illusion that it is always snowing. From April to\nSeptember, Atsungiumajurniapaa can see up to 22 hours of daylight per day, while from\nDecember to March it may see only 2 hours per day. Typical temperatures range from 8\nto 10°C (46 to 50°F) in the summer to -40 to -45°C (-40 to -49°F) in the winter. These\nconditions should be considered when designing an appropriate energy program.\n\nQuilliq Power, a crown corporation founded to provide independent generating capacity\nin Nunavut, has expressed interest in opening a small generating facility in\nAtsungiumajurniapaa, however it took several years for the last community promised a\nfacility to receive one. Moreover, Quilliq Power can only promise a gasoline generator\nrated at 5 kW. Given the lighting and heating needs of the community, this may not be\nenough for the winter months.\n\nHowever, there is currently one power generator in Atsungiumajurniapaa. It is a\nsalvaged ski-sled engine that a local woman converted into a generator for the\ncommunity building. Since it is so inefficient, it is only used in emergencies and is\n\ncapable of generating 1200W (original rating was 3.7hp). Generally, though, the main\nsource of heat and light is whale and seal blubber and oil. Any fuel that is imported from\nNaujat is used to power the generator or the 4 ski sleds, which are very important for\nhunting. In fact, most everything needed from the outside world, from electric parts to\ncooking utensils to foodstuffs, must be imported from Naujat at a premium. The cost for\nmilk, for instance, can top $8 US/liter. Fuel, then, is also very expensive and can cost\nclose to $5.75/liter. All items that travel to the Canadian North are extremely expensive,\nmostly due to transport costs.\n\nThe villagers' main source of income is the export of traditional crafts and music and\nadjustment payments given by the Canadian government for the diamond mine located\nwithin their community's traditional boundary. This money is generally pooled and\ndirected towards collective needs by consensus decision. Their first priority, however, is\nfood, warmth and fuel for hunting, which accounts for approximately 80% of the budget.\nThe Inuit have little concept of \"mine\" and are very open to the idea of shared\nresources. As such, there is great potential for adoption of a community-based power\nsolution if the right price can be reached. They envision electricity being used to provide\nheating and light in the main community building (which houses a shop and meeting\nhall), light personal houses and run a small yet-to-be-built medical clinic operating\nmedical equipment.\n\nNotes:\n\nSome of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of\ncapital support include\n- The Canadian Government\n- Quilliq Power\nThese are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this\narea. Development of independent generating nodes has been a high priority for Quilliq\nPower, you may want to access their website.\n\nChoosing the appropriate types of energy for this area is very important to the success\nin improving access to energy and any subsequent economic development. The table\non the following page may assist you in assessing options for energy sources. This is a\npartial list of potential components/services/prices that you may choose to use. If you\nfind additional or more pertinent information, please use it and include the source from\nwhich you found it.\n\nNot all information needed to present a strong report is contained in this document.\nMore outside research (include sources and verify their reliability!) and careful\nconsideration of conditions will be needed to make a strong assessment and design an\nappropriate system.\n\nSelected Prices\n\nPhotovoltaic panels\nUS$700\n\n50Wp\n\nUS$850\n\n60Wp\n\nUS$1,025\n\n70Wp\n\nUS$1,300\n\n75Wp\n\nUS$1,700\n\n80Wp\n\nUS$2,100\n\n120Wp\n\nInverters\n\nUS$250\n\n300W\n\nUS$276\n\n500W\n\nBatteries\n\nUS$95\n\nDeep discharge, 100Ah/12v\n\nUS$200\n\nDeep discharge, 210Ah/12v\n\nUS$975\n\nDeep discharge, 400Ah/12v\n\nUS$3180\n\nDeep discharge, 1650Ah/12v\n\nGenerator\n\nUS$9,500\n\n1000W\n\nGasoline\nUS$5.75/L\n\nAll fuel must be imported to Naujat and\ntransported to Atsungiumajurniapaa.\n\nWind Turbines\n\nUS$2,500\n\nEfficiency = 40%\n\nWind speed\n\n6.6-8.0 m/s\nThe Arctic tundra can see some very\nstrong winds, however they are very\ncold and constantly full of snow except\nfor July and August.\n\nMinimum wage in Nunavut US$8.50/day\nIn Atsungiumajurniapaa only 26 people\nare employed at this wage, all are\nemployees of a government weather\nstation in Naujat. The rest both sell and\nexport traditional crafts or perform\nnecessary duties around the village and\nare not wage-employed. Adjustment\npayments from the government for the\ndiamond mine amount to about\n$530/month.\n\nFall 2009\nVillage Profile\n\nNyaja Chiefdom, Zambia\nLatitude: 14o 8' South Longitude: 30o 50' East\nTime Zone: GMT+1 (6 hrs ahead of EST) -\n\nNyaja Chiefdom is a remote rural area in the Nyimba district of the Eastern Province of\nZambia. Nyimba is the closest city with grid electricity, but it is 60km away and requires\na 4-wheel drive vehicle to manage the rough road. The next closest city is Petauke,\nwhich is about 79km away. Diesel, batteries, or kerosene can be bought from one of\nthese two towns, and usually traders sell them in Nyaja for a higher cost.\n\nIn Nyaja, 43 villages are divided into 5 sections, with the furthest section being about a\n1.5 hour walk from the chief's compound. Each village is composed of family groups of\nsix to ten people. Most villagers are subsistence farmers who cultivate primarily maize\nfor their family's consumption. The plot size varies from 0.25 to 1 hectare of land per\nfamily. Most families do not own any livestock, but those that do, only own a few\nchickens or goats which are allowed to roam freely around the village. There are 250\nhouseholds in an area of 50,000 hectares, so families do not always border each other.\nMuch of the area around the river is a flood plain. During each annual rainy season, the\naverage total rainfall is 950mm. A stream divides one of the five sections from the rest,\nand is not passable by foot in the rainy season. The Mvuvye river also isolates Nyaja\nChiefdom from nearby cities during the rainy season. Most villages have easy access\nto water, but these surface water sources run dry during the dry season.\n\nThere are currently no electricity generators in Nyaja. The Chief has one diesel-\npowered grain mill, for which villagers pay a fee to use. The Nyimba District Health\noffice supplies the kerosene to power the vaccine refrigerator at the clinic. There are\nfour PV systems in Nyaja, which are owned by the Chief, the clinic nurse, a successful\nstore-owner, and the school. The average family cooks on a three stone wood or\ncharcoal fire, uses candles for light at night, and buys batteries for flashlights or radios.\nGrid-distributed electric power is unlikely to be accessible in the region for at least one\nor two decades. Power from the grid is generated from one of Zambia's many\nhydroelectric dams. The nearest grid electricity is currently about 60 km away.\nElectricity would be used primarily for lighting and radios. A battery charging station\nmight be feasible if people had access to car batteries.\n\nWhen considering a system for this community, it is important to consider the capital\nresources of the community. Few people in this area have formal employment; most\nare subsistence farmers, some bake buns, a couple people have small stores or bars\nthat sell necessities and serve as a social gathering place. As such, most villagers only\nhave very small quantities of cash, and only a few of the wealthier or professionally\nemployed villagers, like the clinic nurse, save large sums of money. Typically, to buy\n\nsomething of high value, one can take out informal loans from relatives or some of the\nwealthier villagers for as high an interest rate as 50%. Recently, the concept of group\nlending was introduced to provide a means for women to save money and generate\nincome by lending money to others. A group of women contribute a small amount each\nweek to a group fund that can be lent to other villagers who pay it back with interest.\n\nSome of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of\ncapital support include\n- Basic Education Sub-Sector Investment Programme\n- PVESCO (Photo-Voltaic Energy Service Company) program\n- Microfinance institutions may be an option, if the energy is being used to\ngenerate income.\nThese are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this\narea. Development of the interior and rural areas has in theory been a high priority for\nthe state and federal governments in Zambia, however in practice, remote villages like\nNyaja have not benefited from these programs.\n\nChoosing the appropriate types of energy for this area is very important to the success\nin improving access to energy and any subsequent economic development.

Boipelogo is one of the more\ndeveloped villages, with a large church that attracts Christians for worship from several\nneighboring communities on Sundays. There is also a technical centre, the Boipelego\nBusiness and Community Development Centre. While this school is currently self-\nsufficient in energy through the use of solar panels, continued expansion is planned, so\nadditional power at the school will be required. There is also a clinic, two small stores\nwhich each have a large meat-storing refrigerator, and a public elementary school which\neducates about one hundred kids annually. In the village, there are around 100 families,\neach with about six to ten members. Most of the men work the soybean and maize\nfields during the day, with families working on large, multi-acre community plots rather\nthan smaller fields. The terrain is harsh and dry, with cracked gullies running across the\nlandscape as a result of massive erosion. The typical home has a small radio, a few\n10W light bulbs, and perhaps a black and white television. The radios are usually on for\nmost of the day, with the lights running for five or six hours at night and the TV used\nonly for a couple of hours each night. Cooking is done using biomass, and most women\nspend two to three hours per day collecting wood to burn. While power was supplied by\na diesel generator in the village to about half the homes, recent increases in the price of\ndiesel of nearly 25% (Current price = 7 Rand (ZAR) per liter) have made this a costly\noption.\n\nThere are other resources available in the area. Solar radiation is high, with over 300\ndays of sun a year. However, solar panels are expensive to use, as they have to be\nimported from South Africa. Panels cost about 4US$/watt, and there have been\nproblems with theft. Any type of 12V battery can be purchased for around 50US$ in\nJohannesburg, about a five hour drive away. There are no local recharging stations, but\nthe batteries can be brought to Mohale's Hoek for a recharge (2 hrs away). Inverters\ncan also be purchased in Johannesburg for around 60US$. Locally, the Senqu River is\nanother potential source of power. High-flow micro-hydro turbines, such as the Francis\nor Kaplan (efficiencies around 90%), can be purchased for around US$2,000 and\nbrought to Boipelego from Lesotho. The river has a flow of 5m3/s in the summer, but\nflow varies tremendously. In the winter, the flow is around 2m3/s, and rainstorms\n(Common from December to February) can increase flow to almost 7m3/s. The river is\nabout 100m wide, though the seasonal variation in flow means that the actual height\nvaries from 1m to 3m. Any bank-mounted installed turbine would have to factor in some\ndowntime for when the height of the river or amount of flow was outside operating\nparameters. Wind power is also an option, though the variation is rather high. Wind\nturbines can be bought in Johannesburg for around US$800 (efficiencies around 40%),\n\nor they could be constructed of locally available materials like fiberglass and wood for a\nslightly lower cost (but also a lower efficiency of around 30%). Speeds of 5m/s to 10m/s\ncan be found consistently at the tops of some nearby peaks, but their distance from\nBoipelego is 1km to 2km.\n\nGrid electricity is not widespread in Lesotho, and only about 10% of rural locations are\nelectrified. Boipelego is about two hours from Mohale's Hoek (which does have grid\nconnection) along a dirt road, and the closest village with electrification is located on the\nother side of the Senqu. Diesel and liquefied natural gas are available but are costly,\nand transportation is a major issue for the community. As for technical skills, the\nstudents at the technical centre are skilled in welding, and some could be hired to\nmaintain the generation scheme for a relatively low cost (10% greater than the average\nper capita income in Lesotho).\n\nLoans are available from the government for some electrification projects, but interest\nrates are high (nearly 40%). The people do not have many assets that could be used as\ncollateral; instead, most of their income tends to come from working in the South African\nmines and gets spent for food or other immediate needs.\n\nSome of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of\ncapital support include\n- Appropriate Technology Services, a Maseru-based government organization that\nworks in disseminating appropriate technology for rural communities. They have\npartnered with D-Lab in the past (More information can be found about ATS at\nhttp://web.mit.edu/ats)\n- World Bank, as they are currently funding a project on parabolic solar troughs\nthat are used as solar thermal power generators. This project was started by an\nMIT student who actually led the D-Lab Lesotho trip for the past two years\n(http://www.synergeticpower.org/).\nThese are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this\narea. Development of the interior and rural areas has always been a high priority for the\ngovernment of Lesotho, and energy access is one of the key factors in economic\ndevelopment.\n\nNot all information needed to present a strong report is necessarily contained in this\ndocument. More outside research (include sources and verify their reliability!) and\ncareful consideration of conditions will be needed to make a strong assessment and\ndesign an appropriate system.\n\nFall 2009\nVillage Profile\n\nAssentamento Pirarucu, Tocantins, Brazil\nLatitude: -11o 48' Longitude: -49o 28'\nTime Zone: GMT -3\n\nThe Assentamento Pirarucu is in rural Tocantins, Brazil, near the Rio Javae. In\nAssentamento Pirarucu, family groups of six to ten people live on acres of otherwise\nisolated land. Each family owns approximately 75 hectares of land. The families all\nhave livestock (a typical family may have 6 cows, 4 pigs and some chickens), and\ncultivate plants like corn and cassava (approximately 1 hectare). Other plants like\ngrasses, palm, mango, papaya, and banana grow everywhere they are allowed. There\nare 150 households in an area of 24,000 hectares, so families do not always border\neach other; there are wetlands, roads, and densely forested areas between family\nlands. About 10 km from the settlement flows the Rio Javae; the closest families live\nabout 5 km from the river, the furthest are about 15 km away. The river runs through a\nwide basin, about 500 meters wide, and has seasonal variations in flow rate with rates\nof 10 L/s/km2 in the rainy season (November to April) and 2 L/s/km2 in the dry season.\n\nGenerators are not uncommon now. Families that have a generator typically use it to\npower a couple overhead incandescent lights, a refrigerator, a fan, and a television.\nGrid-distributed electric power is slowly becoming accessible in the region, and should\nbe available in the Assentamento Pirarucu within five years. Power from this grid is\nfrom one of Brazil's large hydroelectric dams. The nearest grid electricity is currently\nabout 50 kilometers away.\n\nWhen considering a system for this community, it is important to consider the capital\nresources of the community. Few people in this area have what would be considered\ntypical jobs in the US; most are subsistence farmers, some make crafts, a couple\npeople have \"stores\" or \"bars\" that sell necessities and serve as a social gathering\nplace. As such, cash (the real, plural reais) is only available in very small quantities, and\nsaving and investment in money is unheard of. Typically, if one wants to buy something\nof high value, the first step to buying it is to sell a cow or other animal. Financial\nstrategies like loans are hindered by high interest rates, which, though they have fallen\nin recent years, are still around 10%.\n\nSome of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of\ncapital support include\n- The Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria, which formed the\nsettlements more than ten years ago when the FUNAI (Indigenous Affairs\nBureau) established an indigenous reservation nearby\n- The Fundacao Bradesco, a national non-profit which runs a working farm and\nboarding school for children that live in the area villages, settlements, and small\n\ntowns. The school in Canuana, near the Assentamento Pirarucu, is a D-Lab\npartner in Brazil.\n- The Instituto de Desenvolvimento Rural do Estado do Tocantins, the rural\ndevelopment agency of the government of the state of Tocantins\nThese are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this\narea.

The land surrounding Dikgomo is primarily small cattle posts, where\nfamilies keep their cattle. The landscape is primarily desert scrub. Most of the land is\ntribal grazing land, without clear ownership, but there are a few private farms about 15\nkm from the village. There are three times as many cattle as people, and twice as many\ngoats as cattle. The cattle are kept at the cattle posts, where they are allowed to freely\nroam and graze; the goats are dispersed throughout the cattle posts and the village.\nThere are no permanent surface water sources--water in the village is provided through\nfive government-installed boreholes that reach into a water table approximately 100 m\nbelow the surface. Some of the private farms have wind-powered pumps to supply their\ncattle with water. The seasonal rains, if they come, arrive in December and fall\nsporadically until mid-February. If the rains are good, the desert becomes a grassland;\nif not, only the acacia shrubs show signs of greenery. During the rainy season, water\naccumulates in large puddles called pans; these often last a few months into the dry\nseason, but rarely until the beginning of the next rainy season. When the rains are\nespecially heavy, the roads become impassable and take up to a week to dry out. The\nvillage is about 700 km from the capital, Gaborone, the first 200 km is paved, the rest is\na poorly maintained track. Transport of supplies into the village is both difficult and\nexpensive, as only the most rugged items survive the journey intact.\n\nCrops are not grown extensively in the area, though there are some plots of maize, it is\nnot uncommon for the crop to fail due to drought. When this does happen, the\ngovernment drought relief program provides bags of \"mealie meal\" which the villagers\nuse to make a thick porridge to eat with the meat. Few vegetables are grown, but\nduring the rainy season, there are many wild plants that grow in the bush that can be\nharvested and consumed.\n\nThere are 70 households concentrated in the village each comprised of several\nrondavels that make up the family compound. Children from these families attend the\nDikgomo primary school; those that pass their primary leaving exam join students from\nfive surrounding villages to attend the Kgalagadi Community Secondary School, which\nis also located in the village. The government pays for the school to provide tea and\nbread to the students during the morning break, and also a hot meal at lunch.\nTraditionally, food is cooked in three-legged pots over a wood fire. Wood has become\nscarce in the area surrounding the village and is often brought to the school using the\nheadmaster's pick-up truck. Sometimes, the meal program must be suspended due to\na lack of cooking fuel.\n\nNone of the households have electricity, except the headmaster, who has a small diesel\ngenerator. Light is produced by kerosene lanterns or candles. Few of the adults in the\nvillage have a formal education, and although there is an interest in adult education\nprograms, they have been difficult to sustain, due to the lack of lighting at the school.\nThere is a new clinic that has been built on the edge of the village, and the government\nhas stationed a nurse at the site, however the services are quite limited, due to the lack\nof equipment. The closest grid electricity is in the mining town of Jwaneng, about 500\nkm away.\n\nWhen considering a system for this community, it is important to consider the capital\nresources of the community. Livestock is the traditional measure of wealth, and most\npeople would rather invest in a cow than a bank. As such, cash (the pula, which is\nsetswana for \"rain\") is only available in very small quantities, and saving and investment\nin money is rare. Bank loans are available at a 15% interest rate, though few people\napply for them. Typically, if one wants to buy something of high value, the first step to\nbuying it is to sell a cow or a goat. The Botswana Meat Commission provides a high\nprice for livestock, as part of a European Union aid package, though transport to the\nabattoir takes about 10% of the profits. Few people in this area have formal\nemployment; some make crafts, a couple people have small stores or bars that sell\nnecessities and serve as a social gathering place. There is currently a government\ninitiative to promote micro-enterprise, and several indigenous plants have been\nidentified as having a high value on the tourist market. Although low interest loans (5%)\nare available as part of this initiative, no groups have formed to take advantage of them,\ndue to the difficulties in drying and packaging the plants. The sealing equipment for\npackaging the teas and dried fruit, though relatively inexpensive, requires electricity to\noperate.\n\nHistorically, development priorities have targeted educational initiatives; electrification of\nrural areas has not been a high priority. Recently, however, the government has\nrecognized the importance of infrastructure to economic development and has shifted\nsome of its resources to rural electrification schemes. The government of Botswana\nnow offers a 500 pula subsidy for people interested in installing photo-voltaic systems in\nrural areas.

Nyimba is the closest city with grid electricity, but it is 60km away and requires\na 4-wheel drive vehicle to manage the rough road. The next closest city is Petauke,\nwhich is about 79km away. Diesel, batteries, or kerosene can be bought from one of\nthese two towns, and usually traders sell them in Vumba for a higher cost.\n\nIn Vumba, 43 villages are divided into 5 sections, with the furthest section being about a\n1.5 hour walk from the chief's compound. Each village is composed of family groups of\nsix to ten people. Most villagers are subsistence farmers who cultivate primarily maize\nfor their family's consumption. The plot size varies from 0.25 to 1 hectare of land per\nfamily. Most families do not own any livestock, but those that do, only own a few\nchickens or goats which are allowed to roam freely around the village. There are 250\nhouseholds in an area of 50,000 hectares, so families do not always border each other.\nMuch of the area around the river is a flood plain. During each annual rainy season, the\naverage total rainfall is 950mm. A stream divides one of the five sections from the rest,\nand is not passable by foot in the rainy season. The Mvuvye river also isolates Vumba\nChiefdom from nearby cities during the rainy season. Most villages have easy access\nto water, but these surface water sources run dry during the dry season.\n\nThere are currently no electricity generators in Vumba. The Chief has one diesel-\npowered grain mill, for which villagers pay a fee to use. The Nyimba District Health\noffice supplies the kerosene to power the vaccine refrigerator at the clinic. There are\nfour PV systems in Vumba, which are owned by the Chief, the clinic nurse, a successful\nstore-owner, and the school. The average family cooks on a three stone wood or\ncharcoal fire, uses candles for light at night, and buys batteries for flashlights or radios.\nGrid-distributed electric power is unlikely to be accessible in the region for at least one\nor two decades. Power from the grid is generated from one of Zambia's many\nhydroelectric dams. The nearest grid electricity is currently about 60 km away.\nElectricity would be used primarily for lighting and radios. A battery charging station\nmight be feasible if people had access to car batteries.\n\nWhen considering a system for this community, it is important to consider the capital\nresources of the community. Few people in this area have formal employment; most\nare subsistence farmers, some bake buns, a couple people have small stores or bars\nthat sell necessities and serve as a social gathering place. As such, most villagers only\nhave very small quantities of cash, and only a few of the wealthier or professionally\nemployed villagers, like the clinic nurse, save large sums of money. Typically, to buy\n\nsomething of high value, one can take out informal loans from relatives or some of the\nwealthier villagers for as high an interest rate as 50%. Recently, the concept of group\nlending was introduced to provide a means for women to save money and generate\nincome by lending money to others. A group of women contribute a small amount each\nweek to a group fund that can be lent to other villagers who pay it back with interest.\n\nSome of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of\ncapital support include\n- Basic Education Sub-Sector Investment Programme\n- PVESCO (Photo-Voltaic Energy Service Company) program\n- Microfinance institutions may be an option, if the energy is being used to\ngenerate income.\nThese are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this\narea. Development of the interior and rural areas has in theory been a high priority for\nthe state and federal governments in Zambia, however in practice, remote villages like\nVumba have not benefited from these programs.\n\nChoosing the appropriate types of energy for this area is very important to the success\nin improving access to energy and any subsequent economic development. The table\non the following page may assist you in assessing options for energy sources.\n\nNot all information needed to present a strong report is necessarily contained in this\ndocument. More outside research (include sources and verify their reliability!) and\ncareful consideration of conditions will be needed to make a strong assessment and\ndesign an appropriate system.\n\nTable 1 Selected Prices\n\nPhotovoltaic panels\nUS$250\n\n50Wp\n\nUS$320\n\n60Wp\n\nUS$376\n\n70Wp\n\nUS$450\n\n75Wp\n\nUS$460\n\n80Wp\n\nUS$610\n\n120Wp\n\nInverters\n\nUS$100\n\n300W\n\nUS$200\n\n500W\n\nBatteries\n\nUS$145\n\nDeep discharge, 100Ah/12v\n\nUS$320\n\nDeep discharge, 210Ah/12v\n\nUS$900\n\nDeep discharge, 400Ah/12v\n\nGenerator (diesel)\nUS$1100\n\n1000W\n\nDiesel\n\nUS$1.53/L\n\nDiesel costs less in Lusaka, and more\n\nas you travel further from the capital.\n\nUS$2.47/L\n\nIn Vumba, the diesel is sold by store\n\nowners who make more than 50% profit.\n\nBricks\n\nMany villagers in Vumba know how to\n\nmake traditional fired clay bricks from\n\nlocal soil so they do not buy commercial\n\nbricks.\n\nWind speed\n\n1.9m/s to 4.2m/s\nThere are some places in Zambia that\nhave winds greater than 5m/s, but\nVumba is not one of them.\n\nMean wage in Zambia\n< US$2/day\nMost people in Zambia live on less than\n\n$1/day. There is about a 50%\nunemployment rate. Most villagers are\nsubsistence farmers so they have little\ncash income.\n\nFall 2009\nVillage Profile\nBoipuso Village, Phamong, Lesotho\nLatitude: 29o 22'S Longitude: 29o 02'E\nTime Zone: GMT +2\n\nThe Phamong region is home to several small farming communities which cluster\naround the water of the wide, muddy Senqu River. Boipuso is one of the more\ndeveloped villages, with a large church that attracts Christians for worship from several\nneighboring communities on Sundays. There is also a technical centre, the Boipuso\nBusiness and Community Development Centre. While this school is currently self-\nsufficient in energy through the use of solar panels, continued expansion is planned, so\nadditional power at the school will be required. There is also a clinic, two small stores\nwhich each have a large meat-storing refrigerator, and a public elementary school which\neducates about one hundred kids annually. In the village, there are around 100 families,\neach with about six to ten members. Most of the men work the soybean and maize\nfields during the day, with families working on large, multi-acre community plots rather\nthan smaller fields. The terrain is harsh and dry, with cracked gullies running across the\nlandscape as a result of massive erosion. The typical home has a small radio, a few\n10W light bulbs, and perhaps a black and white television. The radios are usually on for\nmost of the day, with the lights running for five or six hours at night and the TV used\nonly for a couple of hours each night. Cooking is done using biomass, and most women\nspend two to three hours per day collecting wood to burn. While power was supplied by\na diesel generator in the village to about half the homes, recent increases in the price of\ndiesel of nearly 25% (Current price = 7 Rand (ZAR) per liter) have made this a costly\noption.\n\nThere are other resources available in the area. Solar radiation is high, with over 300\ndays of sun a year. However, solar panels are expensive to use, as they have to be\nimported from South Africa. Panels cost about 4US$/watt, and there have been\nproblems with theft. Any type of 12V battery can be purchased for around 50US$ in\nJohannesburg, about a five hour drive away. There are no local recharging stations, but\nthe batteries can be brought to Mohale's Hoek for a recharge (2 hrs away). Inverters\ncan also be purchased in Johannesburg for around 60US$. Locally, the Senqu River is\nanother potential source of power. High-flow micro-hydro turbines, such as the Francis\nor Kaplan (efficiencies around 90%), can be purchased for around US$2,000 and\nbrought to Boipuso from Lesotho. The river has a flow of 5m3/s in the summer, but flow\nvaries tremendously. In the winter, the flow is around 2m3/s, and rainstorms (Common\nfrom December to February) can increase flow to almost 7m3/s. The river is about 100m\nwide, though the seasonal variation in flow means that the actual height varies from 1m\nto 3m. Any bank-mounted installed turbine would have to factor in some downtime for\nwhen the height of the river or amount of flow was outside operating parameters. Wind\npower is also an option, though the variation is rather high. Wind turbines can be bought\nin Johannesburg for around US$800 (efficiencies around 40%), or they could be\n\nconstructed of locally available materials like fiberglass and wood for a slightly lower\ncost (but also a lower efficiency of around 30%). Speeds of 5m/s to 10m/s can be found\nconsistently at the tops of some nearby peaks, but their distance from Boipuso is 1km to\n2km.\n\nGrid electricity is not widespread in Lesotho, and only about 10% of rural locations are\nelectrified. Boipuso is about two hours from Mohale's Hoek (which does have grid\nconnection) along a dirt road, and the closest village with electrification is located on the\nother side of the Senqu. Diesel and liquefied natural gas are available but are costly,\nand transportation is a major issue for the community. As for technical skills, the\nstudents at the technical centre are skilled in welding, and some could be hired to\nmaintain the generation scheme for a relatively low cost (10% greater than the average\nper capita income in Lesotho).\n\nLoans are available from the government for some electrification projects, but interest\nrates are high (nearly 40%). The people do not have many assets that could be used as\ncollateral; instead, most of their income tends to come from working in the South African\nmines and gets spent for food or other immediate needs.\n\nSome of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of\ncapital support include\n- Appropriate Technology Services, a Maseru-based government organization that\nworks in disseminating appropriate technology for rural communities. They have\npartnered with D-Lab in the past (More information can be found about ATS at\nhttp://web.mit.edu/ats)\n- World Bank, as they are currently funding a project on parabolic solar troughs\nthat are used as solar thermal power generators. This project was started by an\nMIT student who actually led the D-Lab Lesotho trip for the past two years\n(http://www.synergeticpower.org/).\nThese are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this\narea. Development of the interior and rural areas has always been a high priority for the\ngovernment of Lesotho, and energy access is one of the key factors in economic\ndevelopment.\n\nNot all information needed to present a strong report is necessarily contained in this\ndocument. More outside research (include sources and verify their reliability!) and\ncareful consideration of conditions will be needed to make a strong assessment and\ndesign an appropriate system.\n\nFall 2009\nVillage Profile\n\nPreak Russei, Kaoh Thum District, Kandal Province, Cambodia\nLatitude: 11o 33'N Longitude: 104o 60'E\nTime Zone: GMT +7\n\nPreak Russei is a village of about 500 households located 5 hours north of Phnom\nPenh, the capital of Cambodia. The closest town with an electrical grid is in the\nneighboring district of Kien Svay, which is over 3 hours away with a river crossing.\nThere has been a government initiative to extend power lines into Kaoh Thum since last\nyear, but transportation of the necessary supplies and workforce is challenging due to\nthe distance and geography. As a result, construction has not begun and spools of\npower cables are still sitting in a town near the borders of the Kien Svay and Kaoh\nThum districts.\n\nMost households in Preak Russei use kerosene or candles for lighting, though a few\nwealthier households have access to car batteries for powering lamps or even small\ntelevision sets. Four years ago, the head of the village development committee\npurchased a small diesel generator and his sons now run a small enterprise that\ncharges batteries for a small fee. Households with batteries report spending\napproximately $5 a month on charging services, walking up to 3 km to charge their\nbatteries a couple times each week.\n\nPreak Russei is primarily a farming community, with rice being the main crop. Many\nhouseholds also raise livestock such as chickens, goats, pigs and a cow or two for\nfarming help and supply of milk. Biomass is typically used for cooking, but some of the\nmore prosperous households use canisters of natural gas which are trucked in from\ntown and ferried across the river on a motorized wooden raft. The river running along\nPreak Russei has a very languorous flow that diminishes in the dry season, but there\nare some wind resources available and the region receives over 300 days of sun.\n\nThe commune council and village development committee have been working together\nto build community latrines and expand the primary school. There has been political\npressure to install a couple CFL or LED lamps at the school so children of less\nprosperous families may have a place to do homework at night. Another ongoing\ncommunity project is a center to provide safe drinking water, designed and built by a\nlocal NGO called Resource Development International Cambodia (RDIC) in 2007. RDIC\nhas recently started investigating the possibility of installing a small photovoltaic panel\nto provide electricity for the water treatment equipment. A 12V car battery is currently\nbeing used for powering the arsenic removal system* and the UV disinfection system,\nas well as charging cell phones in the village for a nominal fee. Proceeds from the sale\nof clean water ($0.03 for 10 liters, usually sold in a bottle) and charging services go\ntowards maintaining the water center.\n\nLoans are available from the government for some domestic electrification projects, but\ninterest rates are high (nearly 35%) and the commune council would need to apply as\nthe program is not open to single households. Most households, with the exception of\nthe village head and other prosperous families, do not have many assets that could be\nused as collateral. Most families receive their income from farming or children working\nin Phnom Penh and spend it on food or other immediate needs. Though villagers in\nPreak Russei do not typically have a lot of cash on hand, there is a precedent of people\nbeing motivated to invest in infrastructure improvements. Last summer, some families\nmanaged to save enough to install pipes connecting their homes to the local water\ntreatment center designed by RDIC.\n\nSome of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of\ncapital support include\n- Resource Development International Cambodia (RDIC), a local NGO that\noperates in the Kandal Province (http://www.rdic.org)\n- 1001 Fontaines, a French NGO that has started several solar-powered UV water\ntreatment centers run by local entrepreneurs (http://www.1001fontaines.com/)\n- Ministry of Rural Development, a program of the Cambodian government\nThese are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this\narea. Development of the interior and rural areas has been a high priority for the\ngovernment of Cambodia, and energy access is one of the key factors in economic\ndevelopment.\n\nNot all information needed to present a strong report is necessarily contained in this\ndocument. More outside research (include sources and verify their reliability!) and\ncareful consideration of conditions will be needed to make a strong assessment and\ndesign an appropriate system.\n\n* Arsenic contamination in groundwater is a major concern for Preak Russei and other\nvillages situated in the lower Mekong river basin. It has been referred to as the worst\ncase of mass poisoning in human history, affecting an estimated 2 million in Cambodia\nand 140 million worldwide. Naturally occurring arsenic is called a silent killer because\nthe chemical is colorless, odorless and tasteless. Exposure to high concentrations of\narsenic over a prolonged period of time can cause disease like arsenicosis, in which the\naffected person develops lesions on the hands and feet that make it painful to walk and\nwork. Ultimately, accumulation of arsenic in the body can lead to organ failure and\ndeath. Ground wells in Preak Russei have been shown to have arsenic concentrations\nas high as 1000-2000 ppb, while the World Health Organization standards for drinking\nwater are 5 ppb.\n\nTable 1 Selected Prices and Information\n\nPhotovoltaic panel\nUS$0.50/kWh\nInstalled cost per kilowatt-hour\n\nInverters\n\nUS$100\n\n150W\n\nUS$215\n\n300W\n\nUS$360\n\n500W\n\nBatteries\n\nUS$35\n\nDeep discharge, 40Ah\n\nUS$60\n\nDeep discharge, 70Ah\n\nUS$100\n\nDeep discharge, 115Ah\n\nUS$140\n\nDeep discharge, 150Ah\n\nGenerators\n\nUS$900\n\n1000W\n\nUS$1700\n\n3000W\n\nUS$2800\n\n6000W\n\nDiesel\n\nUS$1.65/L\n\nAvailable in Kien Svay\n\nBricks\nUS$0.15 each\nClay bricks are fired in the village kiln\n\nWind speeds\n\n3.1m/s-5.5m/s\n\nWind turbine\n\n$1500/kWe\n\nInstalled cost per kilowatt\n\nMean wages\n\nUS$2-4/day\n\nFall 2009\nVillage Profile\nBermojur Kachhari Ghat, Sunderbans, West Bengal, India\nLatitude: 22o 32'N Longitude: 90o 20'E\nTime Zone: GMT +5:30\n\nThe Sunderbans is part of the world's largest delta and is interwoven by a network of\nsmall rivers, creeks and waterways. There are roughly 50 habitable mangrove-forested\nislands just above the sea level, which are protected from high tides by bamboo\nreinforced clay dikes. Bermojur Kachhari Ghat is a village of about 1000 people located\non the island of Sandeshkhali. To reach Sandeshkhali from the main city of Kolkata,\npeople travel by road for 3 hours until it ends in Najat, a small port town. From Najat,\nSandeshkhali is a 1 hour boat ride away. Access is even more difficult between the\nmonths of April and September, when cyclones plague the area with destructive high-\nspeed winds and monsoon rains flood the area.\n\nWhile the town on mainland has an electrical grid, it is too difficult and costly to extend\ntransmission lines across rivers and creeks to reach islands in the Sunderbans. None of\nthe households in Bermojur Kachhari Ghat have electricity and most families use\nkerosene lanterns or candles brought by boat from Najat. Relatively cheap Chinese-\nmade generators and diesel can also be purchased on mainland, but the Indian\ngovernment recently raised the price of diesel by $0.04/L in response to an increase in\nthe price of crude oil. While there are currently no diesel generators on Sandeshkhali\nisland, a few wealthier households on neighboring islands have them. The main\nlivelihoods in Bermojur Kachhari Ghat are rice farming, fishing, or catching tiger prawn\nspawn and selling them to commercial farms that produce giant tiger prawns for export.\nMany households also own a few sheep and some chickens, but goats and cows are\nrarer because of the difficulty of raising them in a wet island environment. Most\navailable cow dung is dried and used for cooking. The region also has around 300 days\nof sun and average wind speeds of about 5 m/s. About 20% of the inhabited islands are\ncurrently using solar photovoltaic systems and the nearby Bengal tiger reserve uses\nsmall windmills to power water pumps. While there are some fast creeks and rivers in\nthe Sunderbans, their paths and speeds can vary widely and unpredictably.\nSandeshkhali island is situated between two of the larger and slower flowing rivers.\n\nThe island has a long and narrow shape that is approximately half a kilometer by 10\nkilometers. Bermojur Kachhari Ghat is located on the southern half, and another village\nis located on the northern half. Generating the political will for infrastructure\ndevelopment projects on the island is often complicated, because the two villages may\nnot agree on where to site the projects. On the far north end of the island, a local NGO\ncalled Friends of the Sunderbans has recently built a primary school and health clinic to\nserve both villages. Few of the adults are formally educated and while there is interest\nin an evening vocational training program, it has been difficult to implement without any\nlighting at the school. The new health clinic is also limited by a lack of equipment.\n\nSupplies are brought in periodically from mainland and a small 50W refrigerator has\nbeen donated, but there is no electricity for it to be utilized. Friends of the Sunderbans is\ncurrently prioritizing the refrigerator for vaccines and medicine, because the only 3\nwater wells were broken and contaminated during a cyclone earlier this year and there\nis fear of a cholera or typhoid fever breakout on the island. A senior staff member at\nFriends of the Sunderbans has expressed interest in becoming a co-investor or\nproviding a low-interest loan for a small photovoltaic system. The villagers do not have\nmuch cash on hand, especially after the financial strain from repairing damages caused\nby the recent cyclone. Most households have already used their savings by contributing\nto a village-wide fund for the reconstruction of wells and homes, food and other\nimmediate needs.\n\nSome of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of\ncapital support include\n- Friends of the Sunderbans, a local NGO run by Aunt Nilima, built and operates a\nprimary school and health clinic on Sandeshkhali island\n- West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency, a government program\nwhich has disseminated solar and wind energy to some villages in Sunderbans\n(http://www.wbreda.org)\n- SELCO Solar Pvt. Ltd, a social enterprise that provides sustainable energy\nsolutions and services to under-served households and businesses in India\n(http://www.selco-india.com)\n- The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in India and the Market Facilitating\nand Enterprise Development Organization (MFEDO), entities that jointly set up a\npilot project in the Sunderbans where women are trained to be solar power\nentrepreneurs (http://www.terina.org/docs/Sunderbans.pdf)\nThese are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this\narea.

      "content": "Packing List\nGhana\nShoes:\n-\nTevas (or other rugged sandals)-- very handy for walking around in the hot weather\n-\nNice shoes or sandals-- for when you are dressing up for presentations\n-\nSneakers for playing soccer or other games with the kids.\nGeneral Clothes. Think dark colors or things that don't show the dirt easily! Light-colored\nclothes look dirty pretty quickly.\n-\nSkirts/dresses-- these are important to have when working in the villages (for women), going\nto community meetings, church, etc.\n-\nSlacks-- it is good for men to bring at least one pair of nice (but comfortable) slacks for\ncommunity meetings, church etc.\n-\nWarm clothes-- you won't need much, but a thin fleece may be handy in the evenings,\nsomething waterproof is a good idea too.\n-\nShorts-- good for relaxing at night, but not appropriate for travel or working. Very few people\nwear shorts out of the house.\n-\nSwimsuit--it doesn't take much space, and is nice to have in case there's an opportunity.\n-\nSome kind of hat-- it's hot this time of year and the sun can be brutal. A hat can also be\nuseful in keeping the dust out of your face when riding in the back of a pick-up truck.\nToiletries:\nYour favorite toiletries will be hard to find, so if you are particular about the brands you use,\nbring enough for the trip. Standard toiletries (soap, tooth paste, etc.) are easily available. You\nmay also want to bring packets of tissues for when toilet paper is in short supply.\nHousehold supplies:\n-\nSheets-- a single, colored sheet (2m x 1m) can be helpful in places where the bed looks\nsketchy. You probably don't need to bring a sleeping bag, though you could bring a small\nfleece blanket.\n-\nTowels-- these are bulky, you can probably get by with a smaller one than you are used to.\nKikois/Kanga cloths are a good alternative. You can buy these locally or make them from\nyour own cloth.\n-\nCamping pad-- useful for when you are crashing on someone's floor, also can make the\nrough roads a little more bearable when you're in the back of a truck. But they are bulky, so\nwe can probably make do with just one or two for the team.\n-\nMosquito net--D-Lab provides these, you should bring one along to help prevent mosquito\nbites (and malaria).\n-\nMosquito repellent-- always a good idea.\n-\nPower converter/adapter plugs-- if you are bringing along things that need to be charged.\n-\nShaving/vanity mirror-- useful for putting in contact lenses. You can also put it behind a\ncandle or lantern to get a little more light at night.\n-\nDrain plug-- useful for turning a sink into a washtub.\n-\nClothesline-- handy for drying clothes that you've washed by hand.

It explores the link between the rural sector, agricultural trade, and the realization of\nhuman rights. In so doing it highlights the limitations of the agriculture trade liberalization\nagenda that currently dominates policy-making, including in the World Trade Organization\n(WTO). This Backgrounder suggests ways to approach the global agricultural trading system\nwith a view to making it more responsive to human needs.\nHuman rights law provides tools that can help define an agriculture system that guarantees\nhuman rights for all. Human rights are particularly relevant\nbecause most States, including all WTO Members, have\nratified at least one of the international human rights in-\nBox 1: Percentage of\nstruments, thereby committing themselves to the realiza-\npopulation engaged in agriculture\ntion of human rights.\nDeveloping countries\nNepal\n93%\nII\nThe Rural Sector, Food Systems\nBurkina Faso\n92%\nRwanda\n90%\nand Trade Liberalization\nTanzania\n80%\nChina\n70%\nIf we intend to improve people's livelihoods then we have\nNiger\n88%\nto focus on the rural sector. Around 2.5 billion people live\nIndia\n60%\nin rural areas and are engaged in agricultural production\nBangladesh\n60%\nas a source of livelihood.2 Many of these are small-scale,\nPakistan\n53%\nsubsistence farmers, and the vast majority produce food\nThailand\n52%\nfor local consumption. Agriculture is thus an activity of\ncentral importance, not only for producing and consuming\nOECD countries\nJapan\n5.3%\nfood but also for broader elements of livelihoods includ-\nAustralia\n4.8%\ning culture and tradition. Developing the farm sector, par-\nUSA\n2.7%\nticularly in countries where a high percentage of the\nGreat Britain\n1.7%\npopulation is engaged in agriculture, is an effective way to\ngenerate employment and reduce poverty, as well as to in-\nSources: OECD, 1998 and FAO, 1999.\ncrease levels of health, nutrition and education.\nBackgrounder No. 1\n\nYet agricultural policies today largely focus on increasing production and trade, rather than\non the livelihoods of food producers. These aim at liberalization of the agriculture sector, and\nbegan under International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank structural adjustment pro\ngrammes (SAPs) in the 1980s. The liberalization policies pursued include reducing the role\nof the State in agricultural markets, for instance by cutting its support to the farm sector, and\nreducing barriers to international trade in agricultural products.\nIts advocates claim that liberalization will bring the greatest efficiency and therefore the\ngreatest welfare gains to rural sectors, making us all better off. Liberalization has indeed\nresulted in huge growth in agricultural production accompanied by huge increases in the\nvolume of products traded. Large farmers can survive without State support. And whilst\nagribusiness thrives, liberalization has driven many small-scale farmers out of business.\nIndeed, agricultural imports can complement local production, increase dietary choices\nand provide an alternate source of nutrition. Exporting local produce can also offer new mar\nkets and opportunities for employment and income. But not everyone benefits from the op\nportunities of increased trade - in many cases the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and\nagricultural labourers have worsened. The reality is that simply expanding or liberalizing\ntrade does not automatically translate into poverty reduction, for a number of reasons.\n-\nFirst, most food is produced for local consumption, and only a small proportion - about\n10% - is traded internationally. Whilst export markets provide a useful secondary channel\nfor some producers, and a vital primary channel for a few (such as coffee growers); the\nvast majority of small-scale farmers sell their goods to local consumers, which means that\nexport markets are limited to a small number of large-scale farmers.\n- Second, there is no guarantee that food produced for export to rich countries will be ac\ncepted. Access to developed country markets for developing country products depends on\nproducers being able to meet specific international standards, such as on food safety or\npackaging. Many developing countries do not have the capacity or infrastructure to meet\nthese standards, which are high and result in limiting developing country exports.\nBox 2: Liberalization: the case of Ghana\nIn Ghana, agriculture is an important part of the economy, employing 65% of the active labour\nforce. Even before the WTO was created, IMF and World Bank loan programmes required Ghana\nto dismantle subsidies that the State provided to small farmers producing tomatoes, rice and\npoultry. At the same time, Ghana had to open its markets to produce from abroad. Following\nthis, cheap imports of poultry from the U.S. and Europe, tomatoes from the EU, and rice from\nthe U.S. and Asia flooded the market. The lack of subsidies reduced local farmers' competitive\nness, and consumers chose the cheaper, imported products, to the detriment of small-scale\nlocal producers.\nSource: Anna Antwi, presentation at 3D > THREE Workshop on Integrating Human Rights into\nthe Future of Agriculture, November 2004, report available at: <www.3dthree.org/en/\npages.php?IDcat=5>\nPlanting the Rights Seed\n\nBox 3: Liberalization: the case of Zambia\nAfter liberalization of maize, the producer price fell and the consumer price increased. The\nconsequence was a 20% drop in maize consumption between 1990/1 and 1996/7. The adverse\nhuman rights impacts of this have been documented. For instance, malnutrition and related\nmortality increased. Due to poverty, health indicators decreased and fewer families sent their\nchildren to school. Girls suffer disproportionately as household labour is perceived of greater\nbenefit than education.\nThe IMF's evaluation of the situation, in 1998, was \"While in the long term, [liberalization] will\nimprove allocative efficiency and thereby income, in the short term, it reduced food consump\ntion.\"\nSource: Sally-Anne Way, presentation at 3D > THREE Workshop on Integrating Human Rights\ninto the Future of Agriculture, November 2004, report available at: <www.3dthree.org/en/\npages.php?IDcat=5>\n- Third, liberalization also means opening the domestic market to higher levels of imports.\nThis can actually increase food insecurity because imported food can displace local pro\nduction. Higher levels of imports are particularly damaging when developed countries\nmaintain artificially high levels of production and then sell surpluses abroad at prices\nbelow their cost of production, a practice known as \"dumping.\"3 Dumping can be caused\nby direct payments by a State to its exporters (export subsidies); or by transnational com\nmodity traders and processors who use their market power to push down the prices they\npay to farmers and so increase their profits. In 2003, for instance U.S. wheat was sold\nabroad at an average price of 28% below what it cost to produce it and cotton was sold\nabroad at an average price of 47% below what it cost to produce it.4\n-\nFourth, few people can benefit from international agricultural trade because a handful of\ncompanies dominate world markets. In 1986 it was estimated that 85-90% of global agri\ncultural trade was controlled by five companies.5 Around 75% of global cereals trade is\ncontrolled by two multinational companies - Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).\nAnd whilst approximately 50% of world coffee supply comes from small-scale farmers,\n40% of global coffee trade is controlled by four companies.6 To intensify matters, many of\nthese companies, particularly in the U.S., are the beneficiaries of billions of dollars of\nState subsidies, which enable them to maintain and increase their share of world agricul\ntural markets. Transnational commodity traders and processors, predominantly from de\nveloped countries, have the means to invest in the production, processing, transporting\nand trading processes, giving them a massive advantage over small-scale producers.\nThe key to realizing human rights and improving livelihoods in the rural sector is to de\nvelop policies from a people-centred perspective rather than a narrow economic-centered\nperspective. A human rights framework can help us define people-centred policies.\nBackgrounder No. 1\n\nIII\nThe Human Rights Framework\nHuman rights are legally binding on all States of the world. Some of these rules are set out in\ncountries' national laws, others are set out in international human rights treaties. All States in\nthe world have ratified at least one of these treaties, which include the International Covenant\non Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and\nCultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).7\nOther recent international commitments affirming human rights relevant to agriculture\ninclude the Millennium Development Goals in which all States of the world emphasized their\ncommitment to combat poverty, hunger and disease.8 In 2004, the 188 members of the Food\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO) adopted Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food.9\nMany internationally-recognized rights are affected by agricultural trade policy, including\nthe right to life, to food, to health, to work and to be free from discrimination. Human rights\nlaw requires States to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. In relation to the right to food,\nfor instance, the obligation to \"respect\" means that the State should not take actions that\ndeprive people of their existing access to adequate food. The obligation to \"protect\" means\nthat the State should enforce appropriate laws to prevent third parties, including powerful\npeople and corporations, from depriving individuals of their access to adequate food. Finally,\nthe obligation to \"fulfil\" means that the State should identify vulnerable groups and imple\nment policies to ensure their access to adequate food by facilitating their ability to feed them\nselves. As a last resort, the Government is also required to provide adequate food to those who\ncannot feed themselves. As the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food has noted, it is\nalso fundamental that participation, accountability and access to effective remedies be en\nsured at all times and at all levels of the implementation of the right to food.10\nBox 4: International Human Rights Instruments (extracts)\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that \"everyone has the right to a stand\nard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food,\nclothing, housing and medical care.\" (Article 25)\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees the right to life and\nstates that \"in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence.\" (Articles 1\nand 6)\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) guarantees an ad\nequate standard of living, housing, work, food and health. (Articles 6, 11 and 12)\nConvention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) recognizes the right of every child to an adequate\nstandard of living, as well as the obligation of States to combat malnutrition. (Articles 24 and\n27)\nConvention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) requires countries to\ntake action to guarantee women's human rights, and focuses on the particular problems of\nrural women, including participation in development planning and access to adequate living\nconditions and health care. (Articles 3 and 14)\nPlanting the Rights Seed\n\nSome rights such as the right to life must be implemented immediately. Others, such as\nthose to food and to health, can be realized progressively. Progressive realization means that\nStates must move as expeditiously as possible towards the realization of the rights. To this end\nthey must use \"the maximum of available resources,\" which refers both to the resources avail\nable within a State and those available from the international community through interna\ntional cooperation and assistance.11 States also have international and extraterritorial human\nrights obligations, for instance through ensuring that their own policies do not impact nega\ntively on the enjoyment of human rights in other countries, and through ensuring that activi\nties or decisions of an international organization of which they are a member are human\nrights-consistent. Human rights standards come with a range of procedures for their imple\nmentation and people are able to turn to the courts, or to international redress mechanisms,\nwhen they are not able to enjoy their rights.\nThe human rights framework provides useful tools for approaching economic and trade\npolicy-making. Human rights' emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable members of\nsociety, and on prevention of discrimination, provide a people-centred yardstick against which\nproposed policies can be measured. Moreover, human rights require that States, at the very\nleast, have a policy in place towards the realization of human rights. This means that any\nproposed policies must be measured against the likelihood of improving the lot of the poorest\nand most vulnerable. In other words, the human rights framework provides support for the\nview that there must be assessment of the likely impacts of trade policies, something many\npublic-interest and development advocates have been consistently calling for in recent years.\nThe international mechanisms for implementation and supervision can be seized by groups,\nStates or individuals, and are further tools for holding economic actors accountable when\ndomestic processes fail to promote or protect human rights.\nIV\nThe WTO and Agricultural Trade Liberalization\nThe WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), which came into force as part of the WTO Agree\nment in 1995,12 does not adopt a people-centred approach to agriculture trade policy-making.\nInstead it has entrenched liberalized, export-oriented agricultural trade policies, which ben\nefit large-scale producers and food traders. The AoA does contain provisions that would al\nlow WTO Members to institute a fairer and more people-centred agricultural trading system,\nbut these provisions are largely undefined and underused.\nThis backgrounder focuses on the AoA. But the AoA must be looked at in conjunction with\nother factors, such as IMF and World Bank policies, and bilateral and regional trade agree\nments that many countries are now engaged in. These are all part and parcel of a broad agenda\npromoting liberalization and forsaking people and their rights.\n1. The Agreement on Agriculture - main obligations\nAccording to the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO, the institution's aims are to\nraise living standards, ensure full employment and increase incomes.13 As part of the WTO,\nthe AoA is meant to further the WTO's aims by \"establishing a fair and market-oriented\nagricultural trading system.\"14 The AoA is structured around three \"pillars:\" market access,\ndomestic support and export subsidies.\nBackgrounder No. 1\n\n- Market Access: The AoA aims to increase international trade of agricultural produce by\nreducing border obstacles to trade such as taxes and duties, commonly known as tariffs.\nThis pillar also requires countries to abolish restrictions on the quantity of agricultural\ngoods entering their markets, known as \"quantitative restrictions.\" During the negotia\ntions that led to the AoA, all \"non-tariff \" barriers to trade, such as health standards and\npackaging requirements, had to be converted into tariffs, a process known as \"tariffication.\"\n- Domestic Support: The AoA defines domestic support as all types of government sup\nport to farmers, ranging from subsidies for producing specific products or guaranteed\nprices, to agricultural infrastructure and research. Developed countries are the major pro\nviders of domestic support and pay their farmers billions of dollars each year. The stated\nobjective of the AoA's domestic support pillar was to reduce the amount of money going\ninto production of farm goods; in other words, to reduce subsidies that distort farmers'\ndecisions about what and how much they will produce. The AoA divides domestic support\ninto three categories, set out in three so-called \"boxes,\" each of which is subject to differ\nent WTO requirements.\nAmber Box subsidies are considered to be the most trade distorting. Their amount is\nmeasured on the basis of an \"Aggregate Measure of Support\" (AMS), which attempts\nto calculate all the financial factors that influence a farmer to produce a certain prod\nuct. The AoA required industrialized country Members to reduce their amber box sub\nsidies by 21% by 2003, and developing country Members to reduce them by 13.3% by\n2005.\nBlue Box subsidies are allowed, permitting countries to make direct payments to farm\ners if the payments are linked to programmes that limit the amount of production.\nThese subsidies do not need to be reduced and can be increased.\nGreen Box subsidies are assumed not to affect production levels. The box includes\npayments linked to environmental programmes, pest and disease control, infrastruc\nture development and domestic food aid. It also includes direct payments to producers\nif those payments are not linked to current production and prices, known as \"decoupled\npayments.\" The WTO does not require reduction of green box subsidies, and allows\nthem to be increased.\n- Export Subsidies: These are government payments that cover some of the cost of doing\nbusiness for firms that export produce. The AoA lists export subsidies that WTO Mem\nbers have to reduce, and bans the introduction of new subsidies.\n2. The Agreement on Agriculture - people-centred provisions?\nThe AoA contains provisions that could protect particular countries, or groups of people\nwithin countries, from the harmful effects of liberalization. These include Non-Trade Con\ncerns, Special and Differential Treatment, the Special Safeguard (SSG), and the Marrakesh\nDecision on Net-Food Importing Developing Countries. Although these are not implemented\nin a way that ensures protection of livelihoods and human rights, they do offer openings\nwithin the existing structure of trade rules through which WTO Members can meet their\nhuman rights obligations.\nPlanting the Rights Seed\n\n- In its preamble, the AoA states that it should be implemented with regard for \"Non-Trade\nConcerns,\" including food security, rural development, rural livelihoods and the need to\nprotect the environment. However, what non-trade concerns mean in practice, how they\nshould be implemented into the AoA or what the human rights dimensions of these could\nbe, has not been developed or implemented by WTO Members.\n- Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) is an important feature of all WTO agree\nments including the AoA. SDT is intended to grant developing countries more flexibility\nin how they implement WTO rules, in recognition of the disadvantages they face in the\nworld trading system. The AoA, for example, exempts developing countries from domes\ntic support reduction commitments for low-income farmers, to encourage rural develop\nment. At the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference, in Doha, Qatar in 2001, Members agreed\nthat: \"SDT for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotia\ntions (...) so as to be operationally effective and to enable developing countries to effec\ntively take account of their development needs, including food security and rural\ndevelopment.\"15 However, developed countries consistently fail to honour SDT commit\nments and aggressively fight to weaken such provisions in WTO agreements. The result\ning mechanisms are often weak, such as longer implementation periods and lower reduction\nrates on agreed commitments, or useless, such as unlimited spending allowances for coun\ntries that face unsustainable debt levels and chronic budget shortfalls. Moreover, develop\ning countries that have joined the WTO in recent years have been given only limited access\nto SDT.\n- The Special Safeguard (SSG) is a mechanism open to countries that underwent tariffication\nto provide temporary protection to domestic farmers when there are sudden surges of\nimports or falls in world prices. This could be a vital mechanism to protect local farmers\nbecause it provides domestic markets with some protection from dumping, even if it does\nnot protect from chronic dumping. A major shortcoming of the SSG though, is that it is\nonly available to 21 developing countries: many developing countries did not have as\nmany non-tariff barriers as developed countries, and therefore did not undergo the\ntariffication process.\n- Special attention to food needs of least developed countries (LDCs) and net food-\nimporting developing countries (NFIDCs). The negotiators that crafted the AoA ac\nknowledged that the AoA would have negative impacts on LDCs and NFIDCs. They\ntherefore adopted the 1994 Marrakesh Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible\nNegative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-Importing\nDeveloping Countries, as part of the WTO Agreement. This Decision provided for com\npensation for LDCs and NFIDCs should they be negatively affected by higher food prices\nor reduced food aid following implementation of the AoA. Many studies concurred that\nafter the AoA was adopted, LDCs and NFIDCs were increasingly forced to buy food on\ncommercial terms, while their incomes were declining.16 Nevertheless, Members have\nfailed to properly implement the Decision.\nBackgrounder No. 1\n\nV\nHow Does the AoA Affect Human Rights?\nFrom a human rights perspective the AoA has four key failures: first, its export-oriented\napproach puts the emphasis on expanding production and exports rather than improving the\nlivelihoods of those involved in agricultural production; second, the AoA fails to tackle the\nmarket power of transnational commodity producers and traders; third, the inadequacy of the\nrules legitimizes and institutionalizes dumping; and fourth, the AoA locks developing coun\ntries into an unlevel playing field.\n1.\nPromotes exports rather than livelihoods\nThe AoA's approach to agriculture is based on the ideology of trade liberalization. It en\ntrenches the \"right to export\" rather than human rights. The AoA is designed to open markets\nworldwide and expand trade. This export-oriented approach does not guarantee improvements\nin people's livelihoods. In fact, it benefits the privileged minority that have access to re\nsources, infrastructure, credit and foreign markets.\n2.\nFails to tackle corporate control\nTrade liberalization has increased the market power of transnational commodity traders and\nprocessors, while taking power away from the producers. The AoA contributes to the consoli\ndation of corporate power by ignoring the dominant role that a handful of large companies\nplay at all levels of the food system.\nCompanies gain an increased share of the market by consolidating and acquiring produc\ntive resources and by extending their activities beyond simply producing. Cargill, for exam\nple, runs a huge financial services unit, a seed and fertilizer business, is one of the top three\nbeef producers in the U.S. and runs a worldwide transportation business. With a business like\nthis, known as a vertically integrated business, Cargill is more interested in high sales vol\numes and in keeping inputs cheap for its more profitable livestock and grain processing op\nerations. The market power of companies such as Cargill leave producers as price-takers,\nforced to accept whatever price Cargill and companies like it are willing to pay. Farmers, the\nweakest link in the chain, are left accepting prices below their cost of production year after\nyear and cheap produce is dumped on world markets, whilst\ncorporate profits rise.\nBox 5: Farmers, the weakest\nlink in the corporate chain\nThis threatens livelihoods of farmers all over the world,\nleaving them either impoverished or dependent on subsi-\nFarmers in Mexico and the\ndies to earn a living.\nPhilippines who depend on\nThis situation would not raise human rights concerns if\nmaize for their livelihoods, do\ngovernments were able to discipline corporate behaviour\nnot compete with U.S. farmers\nbut with the companies that\nand ensure that farmers who sell to large companies are\nexport the maize to their coun-\nable to negotiate a fair price. However, many governments\ntries.\nare simply unwilling or unable to control the activities of\ncompanies, and WTO rules do not help them do this.\nPlanting the Rights Seed\n\n3.\nAllows dumping to continue\nThe WTO does have rules designed to prevent dumping. The AoA for instance aims to ad\ndress dumping by decreasing State subsidies that affect production and prices, but this does\nnot stop dumping for a number of reasons. On the one hand, the complex box system has\nenabled developed countries to keep a large portion of their State subsidies. On the other\nhand, the AoA rules do not address the root causes of dumping, namely excess production and\nthe market power of corporations.\nIn addition, it is complicated and time-consuming for countries to take action against dump\ning. For instance, a country must have domestic anti-dumping laws in place in order to im\npose import duties on dumped products, and many developing countries have no such laws,\nand their only recourse is then to turn to the WTO dispute settlement system, which can take\nup to four years to issue a ruling. This is further complicated by the fact that WTO Members\nare still struggling to define which payments to farmers should be allowed by WTO rules.\nDumping is a human rights issue because farmers in developing countries are unable to\nprotect themselves against dumping. Coupled with the lack of social safety nets, this has\ncaused serious human rights concerns since the implementation of the AoA, particularly for\nsmall-scale farmers who lose their livelihoods due to competition from subsidized, dumped\nimports.\nThe human rights framework calls for governments to implement safety nets, and requires\nof States that they implement policies that pay particular attention to the needs of the poor.17\nWhilst there are certainly cases where governments are simply unwilling to implement such\npolicies, liberalization commitments made at the WTO (and at the World Bank and the IMF),\nalso prevent countries from being able to design and determine their own national policy\nstrategies which might address the problems at the border, for instance through raising tariffs,\nor imposing import quotas to protect against import surges.\nBox 6: Volumes and value of imported products\nA 1999 FAO study of 14 countries showed that all experienced a rise in food imports, and there\nfore of food import bills between 1995-98 compared with previous years. The cost of food im\nports more than doubled for India and Brazil and increased by 50-100% for Bangladesh, Morocco,\nPakistan, Peru and Thailand. In India, the volume of vegetable oils imported increased almost\nseven-fold during the 1995-98 period as compared with 1990-94, and palm oil imports increased\n646% from 249 000 to 1 609 000 tonnes. The volume of cereals imported into India increased by\n332% during the same period. In Brazil, wheat and wheat flour imports increased by 43.3%\nbetween 1990-94 and 1995-98. Dairy product imports increased by 194.6%. As a result, the\nshare of domestic production in the consumption of these products decreased, and dependency\non imports intensified.\nSource: FAO, Agriculture, Trade and Food Security, Vol. II, Rome: FAO, 2001.\nBackgrounder No. 1\n\n4.\nLocks developing countries into an unlevel playing field\nSince the 1980s World Bank and IMF structural adjustment programmes have pressured de\nveloping countries to reduce most of their trade barriers. This has created the situation exist\ning today, which sees many developing countries with low border protection measures, little\nscope for domestic price controls and little possibility to provide subsidies due to their limited\nresources. Conversely, developed countries are not subject to World Bank and IMF liberaliza\ntion requirements to reduce and eliminate trade barriers and they have the financial means to\nprovide support to their farmers.\nInstead of seeking to redress the imbalance, WTO rules have locked all countries into the\nexisting unfair system, which is characterized by many developing countries having few trade\nbarriers, leaving them little space to re-introduce trade policies to support their agriculture\nsector.\nFrom a human rights perspective, this situation is problematic, as it deprives developing\ncountries of the policy space they need to implement policies to protect their people, for\ninstance to take steps to manage the flow of imports, to prevent dumped products from abroad\nor to maintain domestic price controls. In particular, it can hinder developing countries' abil\nity to take steps to respect, protect and fulfil human rights.\nCountries' obligations to cooperate internationally for the realization of human rights means\nthat richer countries have an obligation to ensure that practices within their jurisdiction do not\nprevent other countries from taking the steps necessary to respect, protect and fulfil human\nrights.\nAnother dimension of this obligation is that through their membership and influence over\nthe policies of organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank, developed countries must\ntake steps to ensure that IMF and World Bank policies are not undermining countries' ability\nto fufil their duties in the area of human rights. UN human rights treaty supervisory bodies\nhave recognized this on several occasions. In 2000, for instance, the Committee on Economic,\nSocial and Cultural rights encouraged \"the Government of Italy, as a member of [the] IMF\nand the World Bank, to do all it can to ensure that the policies and decisions of those\norganizations are in conformity with the obligations of States parties to the Covenant, in\nparticular the obligations [...] concerning international assistance and cooperation.\"18\nBox 7: A UN human rights body's view of IMF and World Bank programmes human rights\neffects\n\"...some aspects of structural adjustment programmes and economic liberalization policies\nintroduced by the Government of Egypt, in concert with international financial institutions, have\nimpeded the implementation of the Covenant's provisions, particularly with regard to the most\nvulnerable groups of Egyptian society.\"\nSource: UN, Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Concluding Observations:\nEgypt, E/C.12/1/Add.44, 2000.\nPlanting the Rights Seed\n\nFinally, more and more people are arguing that international organizations themselves have\nobligations. Thus, the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO would be considered to bear respon\nsibility for sustaining such an unequal and inequitable pattern of liberalization worldwide.\nVI\nSome Simple Steps Towards Ensuring\nFair Agricultural Trade Rules\n1.\nSupport stronger and simpler rules to prevent and counter dumping\nThe WTO should improve and strengthen the definition of dumping so that products are\nconsidered dumped when they are sold below their cost of production. In addition, importing\ncountries should have the ability to immediately impose countervailing and anti-dumping\nduties where goods are sold abroad for less than the cost of production.\nGroups working on agricultural policy also advocate the publication of annual full-cost of\nproduction estimates for OECD countries. They are also calling on governments to develop a\nmore thorough and transparent methodology to measure the extent of dumping, and make the\nrelevant data publicly available in a timely way. Human rights advocates can support efforts to\nthis end by recalling governments' obligations relating to freedom of information, and par\nticipation in policy-making, as well as bringing to bear the human rights arguments that plead\nagainst dumping itself.\n2.\nTake non-trade concerns into account and use safety nets\nReflecting and incorporating non-trade concerns into agricultural trade policy can change the\neconomic-centered perspective of the WTO and bring in social, environmental and cultural\nconcerns. A people-centred approach can help distinguish between non-trade concerns that\nserve to protect already powerful interests and those that promote livelihoods and human\nrights.\nSome countries have attempted to include non-trade concerns in agriculture negotiations.\nIndustrialized countries like Japan, Norway and Switzerland have called for protection of\nthe domestic agriculture sector to be allowed, on the grounds that agriculture is\n\"multifunctional,\" i.e. plays a cultural and environmental role in addition to serving food\nprotection.\nDeveloping countries, grouped in the \"Alliance for Special Products (SP) and a Special\nSafeguard Mechanism (SSM),\" known as the G33, advocate WTO recognition of SPs and the\nSSM. The SSM would allow developing countries to protect their domestic markets against\nvolatility and sudden import surges. They would be exempt from new tariff reduction com\nmitments on SPs. SPs have not yet been defined but would probably be determined according\nto criteria of food security and rural development needs. Although it is still unclear what the\nSSM and SPs will look like, they could be a welcome mechanism through which to promote\nfairer and more people-centred agriculture rules.\nGender groups are looking at how gender considerations can be reflected in the definition\nof SPs and the SSM. This is an approach human rights advocates could usefully learn from\nand support.19\nBackgrounder No. 1\n\n3.\nMake Special and Differential Treatment provisions\nmore meaningful\nDeveloping countries have long insisted that existing SDT mechanisms are insufficient to\naddress the disadvantages they face. In response, they have tabled 88 proposals at the WTO to\nimprove SDT, which are currently under review. Human rights advocates could usefully sup\nport these efforts, for instance through contacting their trade ministry or trade negotiators in\nGeneva to ensure that the July 2005 deadline is met.\n4.\nConduct Impact Assessments\nArticle 20 of the AoA calls for the current WTO agriculture negotiations to be informed by a\nreview of how the AoA had worked by the end of 2000. Assessment of the effects of the AoA\nsubsidy reduction commitments was to be central to the review. The review was also to focus\non experience with non-trade concerns including food security, rural development and pro\ntection of the environment. Although an \"Analysis and Information Exchange\" process took\nplace at the time in the WTO, its approach was narrow and is generally considered not to have\nfulfilled the Article 20 review requirement.\nHuman rights law requires States to monitor the enjoyment of human rights in their country,\nand to ensure that policies contribute towards the realization of human rights. Given that\nliberalization, as defined and implemented through the WTO, has caused retrogression from\nthe enjoyment of human rights, it is essential that the human rights impacts of any new\nnegotiations be assessed before entering into new commitments. National governments, as\nwell as on the WTO, IMF and World Bank, should be called upon to ensure that such\nassessments take place.\nGiven that WTO Agreements, including the AoA, primarily regulate relations between\nStates and not within them, a human rights approach to assess agriculture trade liberalization\nwould be of particular value, since it would deal with questions of how resources are allocated\nwithin a country. Human rights can support efforts to ensure that any countries' trade policy\ncommitments do not result in discrimination between groups within the country.\n5.\nTackle corporate control\nTrade and development organizations are calling for better management of the power of\ntransnational corporations (TNCs). Meanwhile, an increasing number of human rights advo\ncates are focusing on the human rights obligations of private business. The human rights\nframework is indeed a powerful tool for holding private corporate actors accountable for the\nharmful human effects of their activities.\n6.\nEnsure coherence between governments' economic\nand human rights obligations\nStates' human rights obligations cannot be discarded when countries are negotiating at the\nWTO or with the IMF or World Bank. Whilst the WTO is now paying more attention to the\nquestion of policy coherence, it focuses almost exclusively on coherence between countries'\ntrade, finance and economic policies. This view of coherence needs to be broadened to ensure\nPlanting the Rights Seed\n\nthat countries do not enter into trade or financial agreements that undermine their social\npolicies or their ability to meet their human rights obligations.\nHuman rights, trade and development advocates could contact their ministries responsible\nfor trade, as well as their negotiators in Geneva and call on them to ensure that human rights\nobligations are upheld in any new trade agreements. Human rights advocates could usefully\nincrease efforts to share information and coordinate activities with those working to promote\ndevelopment to put pressure on States to share information and coordinate activities across\nministries, in order that trade rules do not forsake people and their rights.\nVII Conclusion: A Vision for a Global Food System\nThe majority of poor people in the world live in rural areas. To promote true development and\nfulfil human rights, States must implement policies that have an explicit focus on the needs\nand capabilities of these people. This does not preclude the expansion of trade, as trade can be\na valuable tool for development. It does however, require that trade policy be clearly people-\ncentred. Trade seen as an end in itself will not improve enjoyment of human rights or contrib\nute to lasting economic or social development.\nAs it stands, the WTO Agreement on Agriculture fails to provide an adequate framework\nfor agriculture that is consistent with human rights. Instead, its focus on liberalizing the agri\nculture sector worldwide and has led to an agreement that risks displacing poor farmers who\nhave no other options, and leaving them prey to the behaviour of commodity traders and\nagribusinesses.\nTrade and development NGOs as well as farmers groups have started their quest to develop\nand advance their vision of a fairer global food system, one that promotes human rights and\nguarantees food security, livelihoods and sustainable development. Human rights groups should\njoin this process. In the meantime, this Backgrounder offers an initial approach to understanding\nthe main problems with the agriculture trade system, and ideas for steps to improving it.\nBackgrounder No. 1\n\nNotes\n1 FAO, Some Issues Relating to Food Security in the Context of the WTO Negotiations on Agriculture,\nDiscussion paper, Geneva, July 2001.\n2 Bill Vorley, Food, Inc. - corporate concentration from farmer to consumer, UK Food Group, 2003.\n<www.ukfg.org.uk>\n3 There are various definitions of dumping in the WTO.

      "content": "An Overview of Photovoltaic Systems Applied within Developing Countries\nThe Photovoltaic Primer\nby Jeff Bishop, Jim Bales, Amy Smith,\nand Shawn Frayne\nSolar energy in its purest\nform can be used for a\nvariety of uses, such as\nruit drying, cooking, water\nfr\nheating, and direct transfer to\nheat\n\nelectricity. For the latter technol-\nogy, the medium is in the form of photovoltaic cells.\nSunshine reaches the earth as radiation, providing 1367 W/\nm of energy, composed of millions of high energy particles\ncalled photons. Roughly 25% of this energy is immediately\nlost going through the atmosphere, but the rest hits earth\nas solar radiation, either direct (straight focused rays) or\ndiffused (refl ected by the atmosphere). On cloudy days, up\nto 100% of this radiation is diffused, causing solar panels\nto lose about 80% of their power. The amount of sunlight\nactually striking a surface is referred to as solar irradiance,\nwhich meteorologists measure to determine if a particular\narea is well-suited for solar electricity. For most of sub-\nSaharan Africa, this amount is sizable, with anywhere from\n3-8 hours a day of prime solar irradiance (over 1000 W/m2).\nFor example, Uganda averages around 4.5 kwh/m2 per day,\nand Botswana averages around 6.1 kwh/m2 per day.\nIf this power source could be converted to electricity with no\nloss, the potential is amazing. In just one meter squared,\nUganda could have 108W daily and Botswana 146W. If you\nfactor in the entire earth, in just one hour 1.2*1017 W of solar\npower is produced: enough to supply the earth for an entire\nyear. However, photovoltaic systems do have signifi cant\nlosses--most panels operate with an effi ciency of less that\n15%, and there are further losses in other components of\nthe system. Even so, photovoltaics still are a viable option\nin areas with suffi cient irradiance and have a variety of\nuses, as shown in Table 1 below:\nTable 1: Estimated number of operating PV systems in eastern and\nsouthern Africa countries (1994)\nInstalling a PV system in a community\ncenter in Petite Anse, Haiti\nVaccine Refrigeration\n>1000\nHome Lighting Systems\n>50,000\nWater Pumping Systems\n>200\nSchools/Mission Power\n>1000\nElectric Fencing\n>200 km\nTo learn more about photovoltaics and\ntheir application in the developing world,\ncheck out ITDG's Tech Briefs:\nht tp://w w w.practicalaction.org /\n?id=technical_briefs\nD-lab\nTechnology\nOverv\nOv view\ngy\ni\ngy\nvi\nvi\nv\nDevelopment, Design, Dissemination\n\nPhotovoltaic Primer\nOverview of the Science and Application of PV Systems\nHow Does PV Work?\nIn 1839, a nineteen year old French scientist, Alexandre-\nEdmund Becquerel, noticed electrical currents arising from\ncertain materials when exposed to light. He developed his\ntheory: light can cause electricity to be generated. Although\nhe published his knowledge, it took some time until this was\nrefi ned. In the 1950s, American scientists started to exploit\nthis to a large degree: the fi rst solar cell on a satellite,\nVanguard I, occurred in 1958. Today, solar cells are manu-\nfactured worldwide, with centers in USA, Germany, Spain,\nItaly, Japan, Brazil and India.\nThe solar cells most appropriate for use in developing\ncountries are all based on silicon; other semi-conductors\nare used for applications, such as satellites, where cost is\nnot an issue. When a photon of incident light strikes the\nsilicon, it can transfer its energy to an electron. If a load is\nconnected to this (such as a wire), electrons fl ow out as a\ncurrent. The stronger the light, the more electrons will fl ow\nand the larger the generated current.\nThere are three main types of solar cells that are used:\nmonocrystalline - cells cut from single crystals of silicon.\n11-18% effi ciency, but most expensive.\npolycrystalline - cells cut from many crystals of silicon. 8-\n11% effi ciency, moderately expensive.\namorphous - created from silicon not in crystalline form. 3-\n\nThe Three Types of Solar Cells\ns\n6% effi ciency, least expensive. Shortest lifetime.\nEach one of these solar cells generate a potential voltage\ndifference of ~0.5V. Thus to achieve a 12V battery, approxi-\nmately 24 of them need to be placed in series.\nThe Battery\nUnfortunately, when the sun is shining it is the least likely\ntime for people to be using lights in their house. A medium\nof energy storage is necessary, which takes the form of\nAmorphous cells\n(Image source: solar.calvin.edu/)\nPolycrystalline cells\n(Image: www.plastecs.com/)\nMonocrystalline cells\n(Image: www.pvresources.com)\n\nPhotovoltaic Primer\nOverview of the Science and Application of PV Systems\na battery. Although car batteries can be used, it's much\nbetter to use a battery especially designed for solar electric\nsystems.\nThere are two main battery types:\nLead Acid Batteries - Based on the chemical reaction\nbetween lead dioxide and negative lead plate, with an\nelectrolyte composed of sulfuric acid and water. When\ncharged, the lead dioxide accumulates on the positive plate\nand the lead on the negative plate. The relative amount of\nsulfuric acid in the electrolyte increases, thus leading to an\nincreased voltage difference. When discharged, the sulfuric\nacid in the battery decreases as the sulphur combines with\nlead and accumulates on the negative plate.\nNickel-Cadmium (nicad) - Based on the chemical reaction\nbetween nickel hydroxide and the (negative) cadmium\nhydroxide, with similar effects to the lead acid battery.\nThe nicad batteries are more expensive and have lower ef\nficiency. In addition, they are not as robust and require strict\nadherence to their recommended charging procedures.\nTheir advantages lie in being lighter and smaller. Further\nmore, they can be rapidly discharged without damage to\ncells, can be left in a low state of charge, require less main\ntenance, have a longer life, and can be operated over a\nwider range of temperatures.\nIn rural Africa, lead acid batteries are much easier to obtain.\nAmong these, there are two different varieties: the deep\ndischarge, or deep cycle, which allows more energy to be\ntaken out, and the shallow discharge, such as those found\nin automotive applications. Although the former is better as\nit allows more flexibility, the latter is often used because of\nits wide availability.\nThe amount of charge that can be stored in a battery can be\napproximately determined by multiplying the charge current\n(I) by the amount of time the current has been applied (t), to\nget the amount of charge in amp hours (Q). To determine\nthe number of watt hours available in the battery, simply\nmultiply Q by the voltage in the battery (either 12V or 24V).\n\nPhotovoltaic Primer\nOverview of the Science and Application of PV Systems\nBatteries should not be charged at a current higher than\n1/10 of rated capacity. During the charging phase, 10-30%\nof the energy is lost as heat.\nCharge Controllers and Load Management\nWe now have the photovoltaic cells and the battery, and now\nwe're ready to connect the battery to the load (lamps, radios,\nrefrigerators, etc.). To ensure that the energy level in the\nbattery remains at optimal levels, there needs to be an inter-\nmediate device. For this we have charge controllers, to provide\ncentral point for connecting the load, modules and battery\npack; to manage the system so harvested electricity is used\neffi ciently and protect the components; and to allow users to\nmonitor the system and locate potential system problems.\nIf nothing else, the charge controller should contain a junction\nbox with fuses to account for large current fl ow. When the\ncurrent fl ows above a certain level, the metal wire inside the\nfuse will melt, forming an open circuit and stopping current\nfl ow. For rural Africa, simple automotive fuses or fuse wires\ncan be used. Most battery shops will stock these. It is also\nhelpful to have a main circuit switch, thus ensuring that\nforgotten loads will not drain the battery.\nLamps and Appliances\nMost lamps and other appliances are built in Africa to run\noff of the standard 240V AC. If directly plugged into the\n12V DC, there will be problems, such as sparks and the\ndestruction of the lamp or the battery will discharge without\npowering the appliance. There are appliances that are\ndesigned to run off 12VDC, or an inverter must be used to\nconvert from direct current to alternating current.\nLamps\nincandescent lamps were the fi rst type of the light bulb,\ns\ndesigned over a century ago. The bulb is fi lled with an\ninert gas, and a thin tungsten wire (the fi lament) conducts\nelectric. When electric passes over the fi lament, the resis-\ntance causes the wire to heat up to 3000 degrees Celsius,\ngiving off heat and light. These can be designed to run off\nof 12V. Typically about 90% of the energy is lost as heat,\nwhich leads to low lighting effi ciency.\nThe installation of charge controller\nand circuit breaker box in a PV system\nWhile it is possible to not use a charge\ncontroller, extra care must be taken to\navoid deep discharge and destroying\ncomponents.\n1.

These must operate between 70-\n100V AC, and so require an inverter to increase the voltage\nand change the current from DC to AC (thus losing 10-15%\nof the electricity in the process).\nlight emitting diodes (LEDs) are made from layers of silicon\nand seeded with atoms of phosphorus, or germanium,\narsenic and other rare-earth elements. A cheap plastic\nrefl ector focuses the light into a beam that can be narrow\nand very bright, or wide and diffuse. Electricity fl owing\nthrough the diode is directly converted to light, without heat.\nTechnical advances have greatly improved the quality and\nreliability of LEDs since they were invented in the 1960s,\nmaking them much brighter and more effi cient and suitable\nfor home lighting applications.\nTable 2: Lighting Comparison Table\nIncandescent\nCompact Fluorescent\nLED\nEffi ciency\n5-18\n39-70\n25-50\n(lumens/watt)\nRated life\n6,000-15,000\n50,000\n(hours)\nDurability\nFragile\nFragile\nRobust\nSource: Light Up the World Foundation, http://www/lutw/org/Technicalinfo.html\nThis is what a PV system you might fi nd\nWirings and Fittings\nin a developing country (in this case Haiti)\nThe amount of current that can fl ow through a wire is akin\nmay look like.

For a 12V DC,\nuse at least 2.5 mm2 (19 AWG) with a separate black wire\nwrapped around for grounding.\n\nPhotovoltaic Primer\nOverview of the Science and Application of PV Systems\nSockets\nA low-voltage, high current DC socket is recommended\nfor solar installations, although the standard 240V AC is\ncommonly used. If the latter is used, the energy efficiency\nis not nearly as high.\nConnections\nA terminal strip (insulated screw-down wire clamps used to\nconnect wires together) should be used. Strip the insulated\nends of the wire 1.5-1 cm from the end. Twist the end, pref\nerably with a crimp tool, and wrap around the clamp before\nscrewing it down. When finished, inspect all connections to\nensure that there are no loose wires.\nGrounding\nTo protect against electric shocks and damage to the system\nfrom lightning, the system must be grounded to provide an\neasy path for electricity to travel. Attach a wire leading from\nmetal casings of all valuable appliances or modules to a\nrod driven into the ground.\nMaximum Wire Runs\nAs the distance from the battery to the appliances increase,\nthe amount of voltage lost through the wire will increase as\nwell. To ensure this doesn't happen, ensure all wires are\nless than 15 meters and carry no more than 4 amps.\nPlanning your system\nNow that you know all the components you need, it's time\nto actually plan your system.\n1.

Total this up to\ndetermine your daily requirements.\nUnfortunately, theft of solar panels can\nand does occur. To decrease this risk,\nposition the panel as high as possible\nand use a steel mount. Place it as close\nto your house as possible so you will be\nalerted if anyone is near it. Downward\nfacing spikes can be a deterrent.\nMaintaining Your System\nThe Solar Panel - The solar panel is\neasily maintained, just make sure there\nis no shade blocking it and rinse it off\nif dust accumulates. It should last over\n20 years.\nThe Battery - Good batteries will last\nbetween two and ten years if properly\ninstalled, maintained and managed.\n1. Check state of charge to ensure\ngood performance. Keep records.\n2. Check electrolyte levels in each\ncell. Replace water lost during\ngassing with de-ionized water.\nPlates should always be below level\nof electrolyte. Rainwater/\nhomemade distilled water can be\nused.\n3. Clean top of battery periodically.\n4. Clean terminals and contacts.\nApply petroleum jelly or grease to\nterminals to prevent corrosion but\nbe careful not to short the battery\nterminals.\n5. Give battery occasional equalizing\ncharges to mix up electrolyte.\nWiring - Annually, ensure that all wires\nare still in good working condition,\nnon-frayed and that all connections\nare attached.\n\nPhotovoltaic Primer\nOverview of the Science and Application of PV Systems\nTo determine the size of the PV array, calculate the solar\nenergy available by using records from meteorological\nstations for the area. Check which month has the lowest\nmean daily irradiance, and pick the module that will meet\nyour energy requirements based on this month. Dividing\nyour total load by the efficiencies of the batteries, charge\ncontrollers and inverters will give you the power you need\nfrom the array.\nOther factors:\n1.

      "content": "D-Lab\nFall 2004\nToilet Talk\nAppropriate Toilets for Developing Countries\nAmy Deora, RPCV--Jamaica\nTechnically, \"latrine\" is the word used for any non-water toilet. However, latrine is\nconsidered a \"dirty word\" in some places, so it's better to call what you are building a\ntoilet.\n2 billion people don't have a toilet. What do they do?\n- Go outside. Some common areas used for these purpose are fields used to grow\ncrops or rivers. Sometimes there is an established area that acts as a community\ntoilet.\n- Use a \"bucket toilet\" inside the house and then dump it somewhere.\n- Use a neighbor's toilet when they can.\n- Use a plastic bag or container and then dispose of it in a trash heap.\nWhy do people still not have adequate sanitation?\nIt's not totally a lack of money. Many governments and NGOs have spent lots of money\nbuilding toilets for the poor.\nAs many as half of the toilets built do not get used. Why?\n- If you are used to going outside in the open air, a smelly toilet is not an enticing\noption.\n- Some technologies are hard to maintain, and will fail when there's no\nmoney/expertise for maintenance.\n- The toilet starts to smell and the neighbors start to complain.\n- Some toilets have usage requirements that are difficult for people to understand\nor follow.\n- Toilets are vandalized or are not used due to conflicts in the community.\n- The type of toilet is unusual and people are uncomfortable using it.\n- In some places going out to relieve yourself is a social ritual.\n- If a toilet is better than the house someone lives in, he might tear down your toilet\nand use the materials to improve his house.\n- The pit/vault/septic tank fills up and there's no way to empty it.\n- Outdoor toilets are seen to be inferior to flush toilets, so people would rather not\nhave the physical evidence of using an outdoor toilet near their house.\n\n- Toilets can be dark and scary places. Some people may be afraid of their\nchildren falling in toilets, criminals hiding in them, or women leaving the house to\nuse them.\nAs you can see, this is a long list, and it is only a partial list of problems that may arise.\nThe general idea here is that sanitation projects are not simply a matter of building\ntoilets. You could build great toilets, using the best technology, and they still could lay\naround useless once you've gone. Getting people to use the facilities and change their\nbehaviors is not something that happens overnight, and takes a long and concerted\neffort in a community.\nTypes of toilets\nDry:\n- Pit toilet\nWaterborne:\n- Ventilated improved pit (VIP) toilet\n(\"improved\" is code for \"has a vent\npipe\")\n- Soakaway pit\n- Septic tank\n- Hookup to a central sewage\n- Ventilated improved double pit\nplant.\n(VIDP) toilet: (dehydrating system)\no sealed or unsealed\nWaterborne toilets can be \"pour flush\"\no passive\ndehydrating\nor\n(you throw a bucket of water down them\nactive composting\nto flush) or mechanical flush\n- Composting toilet\nDesign factors of the basic toilet\n1. Which basic type of toilet best suits the community?\n- Waterborne or dry? (partly cultural, part technical)\no Are people washers (waterborne better) or wipers (dry is probably the best\noption)?\no What's the site like? Where is the nearest water source? How high is the\nwater table? (Water intrusion would be a problem if the toilet is designed\nto be dry.)\no What are the soil conditions like? (Loose soils make for unstable pits. You\nmay need a casing for the pit.)\no How much room is there around people's homes?\no How much money does the community have/can they get from donors?\nAre there people trained to maintain complicated systems?\nThe only situations in which you would encourage a water-based solution would be if\npeople use water to clean themselves after using the toilet, or in a more developed\ncommunity that has the money and expertise to maintain a water-based solution and\nis opposed to traditional pit latrines.\n- Are you going to actively compost the waste, or passively dehydrate it?\n(mainly technical, partly cultural)\no What is the climate like?\n\no What's the attitude toward human waste? Do people use waste for\nfertilizer? Would they be open to using composted human waste?\no What do people grow in the area?\no What diseases are endemic in the area? What is health risk be if people\nhandle waste improperly?\no\nHow are the vaults going to be emptied? Who is going to empty them?\nPassive dehydrating systems are somewhat harder to maintain than regular pit\ntoilets, but are environmentally better, and often (but not always) less smelly.\nComposting toilets are the hardest to maintain, but provide valuable compost and\nhave the potential to be very odor-free.\n2. What kind of \"options\" does the community want for its toilet?\n- Seat (totally cultural)\no Do people like to sit or squat?\n- Urine separation (mainly technical, partially cultural)\no What to do with the urine after separating it\nSeparate soakaway pit: remember urine can eat away at concrete\nover time.\nSave for fertilizer: will people use it?\no How to separate urine\nBehavior - put a separate urinal within or outside the toilet\nurine-separating seat\nmesh toilet bottom or sloped toilet bottom leading to a pipe\n- Type and size of vault (technical)\no Underground vs. aboveground vault?\nDoes the area flood? Is the soil unstable, or solid rock? Is there\nmore solar heat to \"cook\" the compost aboveground?\no How big should the vault/vaults be?\nHow many people will use the toilet?\nHow long is it supposed to last?\no Sealed vs. unsealed vault\nWill groundwater contamination be a problem?\nWhere are water sources relative to the toilet?\nIs it possible to re-site the toilet if there's a conflict?\nIf it's unsealed there's potential for an \"Arborloo\" (plant a tree on top\nof the pit after it becomes full; mobile superstructure moved to new\npit.)\no What will the vaults be made of?\nWhat's available? What are soil conditions like?\nPossibilities: plastic water drums, block, stone (unsealed)\no How to open the vault\nPut a door on the vaults of an aboveground latrine\nMake the slab removable to empty an underground pit.\n- Ventilation (technical)\no Vent pipe: How big? Made out of what?\nPossibilities: PVC pipe (expensive), cinder block, bamboo, pieces\nof plastic.\n\no How to keep out bugs: If the superstructure is dark then the only light the\nflies can see is at the top of the vent pipe and they fly towards the light\nand are captured by the screen.\no Which way does the wind blow? Keep smells away from houses,\nneighbors, especially shops or outdoor kitchens.\nVentilation (both pipe and siting) is particularly crucial to pleasantness\nof your toilet, and therefore to the success of any project.\n- Superstructure (mainly cultural)\no\nWhat are local buildings like? Have a local mason design this part.\no\nIs this a permanent structure or a temporary, emergency one?\no\nHow can you incorporate the ventilation and bug-killing schemes?\n- Slab (technical)\no What weight will it bear?\no What are the vaults made out of?\no Are soil conditions stable?\no How can you make sure it doesn't hold standing water?\nBest practices\nMost of the design elements of a toilet should be chosen based on the specific situation\nof each site. However, there are some best practices that you should be aware of:\nVent Pipe: Should be at least 2\" in diameter, straight (no elbow), and extend at least 18\ninches above the top of the superstructure. For maximum airflow, the pipe should start\nlevel with the bottom of the slab so that no smelly air can get trapped between the part\nof the pipe that is extended and the bottom of the slab. Many practitioners have lately\nbeen increasing the diameter of the vent pipe to up to 6 inches. A larger vent pipe will\nusually have larger airflow, which will make the superstructure maximally odor free.\nHowever, in my experience, having a vent pipe this size can lead to smells outside of\nthe latrine when there's a quick change of wind direction. Smells outside of the latrine\ncan often be more problematic than inside because outside smells affect neighbors who\nmay not be getting the benefit of having the latrine.\nFlyscreen: It is critical that the vent pipe have a fly screen tightly sealed to the top. If\nthe latrine is dark, flies will be attracted to the sunlight coming through the pipe, and fly\nup to the top. If the flyscreen is attached, they can't get out and die up there. If a\nflyscreen is not in place, they get out and land on the kids.\nSlab: Should be at least 3\" thick, reinforced concrete. Many slabs are not reinforced\nbecause the area they cover is very small and it is not considered necessary, but\nbecause of high usage I have seen many un-reinforced slabs cave in over time.\nVault Size: There is no absolute best practice for this, but for sealed latrines, one rule\nof thumb is 0.8 m3 per person per year. Unsealed pit latrines should be at least 5 ft deep\nand are usually 6 to 8 feet deep. Of course, always overestimate! In areas like schools\nor other public areas, sealed vaults may not be the best solution because they may fill\nat an unpredictable rate.\n\nSiting: There are usually local building regulations. If you are in an urban area, even in\nan informal community, look at these and attempt to follow them as much as possible -\nyou don't want a local official to have a good excuse to tear down a latrine because it\nisn't within code!\nA word about concrete: there are many differing standards for the use of concrete - how\nlong it should cure, what type of aggregate you should use, etc. This will depend a lot\non climate and local practices. Get a local mason to help you, and follow local practices\n- local builders know what they are doing.\nLinks to sites with specs for different types of latrines\nComposting toilets:\nhttp://peacecorps.mtu.edu/erda/links.htm\nhttp://peacecorps.mtu.edu/sj/Types.htm\nExcellent reference with detailed specs on different types of toilets:\nhttp://www.who.int/docstore/water_sanitation_health/onsitesan/ch04.htm\nInformation in the context of the Ecological Sanitation movement, which is also trying to\nmove the developed world toward more efficient sanitation practices:\nhttp://www.ecosanres.org/\nhttp://www.gtz.de/ecosan/english\nBehavior and maintenance issues\nRepairing the flyscreen: Even a small tear in the flyscreen on the vent pipe can cause\na huge amount of insect invasion. This flyscreen material can be hard for people to get,\nso leave some extra on hand for after toilets are built.\nPutting things down the hole: This is far and away the biggest maintenance issue.\nChildren in particular seem to love to throw things down holes. Educating them about\nthe new latrine is crucially important. A lot of garbage gets thrown into latrines that\ndoesn't break down and fills up the pit way too early and collects water, causing smells.\nExplain to women that they cannot put sanitary napkins (unless they use all organic\nmaterials) or disposable diapers down the pit. It is also important that people\nunderstand that they can't let much water get in. This can be emphasized by calling it\nthe \"dry toilet\" and reinforcing that first word.\nComposting/dehydrating toilets are problematic in that they require people to throw in\nsome organic material to facilitate drying/composting. Be careful how in how you explain\nthis to people. It is often hard to get people to identify what is an organic material and\nwhat is not. In developing countries, people often throw their inorganic trash on the\nground, and then rake everything up at the end of the day - and you don't want them to\nthrow this in the toilet. Many people are used to throwing things like gasoline into\ntraditional pit toilets to dry them out - this is disastrous for any sealed vault system.\nKeeping the floor and seat clean: Encourage people to paint, polish, or lay down vinyl\nflooring (surprisingly cheap many places) so that surfaces are easier to clean. Wooden\nsurfaces are particularly good breeders of germs.\n\nEmptying vaults: Double vault systems are often built with the idea that the users will\nempty them when they fill, but people are often intimidated or disgusted by this task -\neven when the toilet doesn't smell, and then this step never gets done and the toilet\nnever gets used. There is actually evidence that worldwide nearly half of VIDPs never\nget emptied. It is usually more realistic to have a particular person either inside or\noutside the community designated to do this for a fee.\nEven though compost that comes out of a vault should be safe, it's not guaranteed to be\ntotally pathogen free. It should be kept away from children, and people should be very\ncareful about washing their hands after handling it\nPublic latrines: Public latrines are problematic because not everyone knows how to\nuse it correctly. If you put up a sign about proper toilet behavior, remember that many\npeople will not be able to read it.\nHAND WASHING is the most crucial part of proper sanitation. Make sure people\nhave an available water source and soap or ashes to wash their hands after using\nthe toilet.\nWhat to do if you have a smelly toilet\nIf you are in a community for a short period of time, some of the best interventions you\ncan make are helping people to improve their existing toilets, or to help them realize\nhow some of their behaviors might be causing any of the odor problems they are\nhaving.\nThe reason that most toilets are smelly is because their contents are wet. Keep this\nconcept in mind when troubleshooting issues - it might be as simple as making sure\npeople aren't cleaning the pit with water or encouraging them to urinate another place.\nAnd, after a really big rain, the thing just might smell for a while, and there's not much\nyou can do about it.\nHave the users pour ashes into the toilet: Ashes are one of the best odor controllers.\nThis is usually fairly easy to do because in most developing countries, people cook on\ncoal fires. Have them pour in a few cups at once, and then have them get into the habit\nof emptying their coal pot into the toilet every day. Sawdust is another good odor-\nabsorber. If none of these is available, put in anything organic in that will absorb some\nof the moisture. Remember the \"fine balance\" issue above.\nAdd/Extend the vent pipe: Adding a vent pipe to an existing latrine with no ventilation\ncan make an incredible difference in odor. For a toilet that already has a vent pipe, try\nattaching additional length of the vent pipe above the superstructure, to help carry odors\nfurther away - I have seen pipes extending up to seven feet above the roof. This can\nmake a huge difference.\nPaint it black: By painting the vent pipe or the vaults black or by adding a black metal\npanel, you can get a surprising increase in temperature that in the case of the vent pipe\n\nwill help suck air up the pipe, and in the case of the vaults will help speed the\ndehydration process.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.701J / 11.025J / 11.472J D-Lab I: Development\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
