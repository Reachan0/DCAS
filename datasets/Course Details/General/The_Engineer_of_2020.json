      "content": "General questions: Are we doing the right thing for our students? Do MIT students have any\nadvantages over our competitors? What should our education do?\nFrom the couple of weeks I have been at MIT, I have found that there are many things I believe give MIT\nstudents an advantage over students in other colleges.\n1. Students are challenged.\nThis is probably a gross understatement, but thanks to the filtering process MIT can set the bar higher,\ncompared to other universities, as far as the challenge associated for schoolwork. Of course, it will\nalways be the case that some will find the schoolwork more challenging than others, but overall the bar\nis set quite high. Even if not all students are able to excel at said challenges, the experience earned from\nattempting them is probably greater than that gained from, say, successfully completing basic\nchallenges. The flipside is that sometimes some students might be unprepared for said challenges and\nwould crash and burn, however, this isn't necessarily the case, which brings me to my second point.\n2. There are tons of resources available to students.\nEven if you happen to be having a hard time with classes, there are just TONS of resources made\navailable to students to get help. Many classes offer recitation, office hours and tutoring, on top of that\nyou can find past test, homeworks and lectures on OCW. There is also Seminar XL which is a seminar\ntargeted at minorities which is basically a small group that meets a few times a week to go over material\nwith a TA, which allows for a more one-on-one interaction than in recitation. There is also ESG and\nConcourse which are a great resource as they accommodate for the needs of students for different\nlearning styles. If you need to find even more resources then MIT has S3 which is a godsend. Overall, if\nyou need help you can find help and people are more than happy to help you out if you ask. I don't\n\nknow to what extent this is true in other universities, but at least in MIT I find the amount of help you\ncan get to be at an excellent level.\nOn top of the help resources, there are plenty of other resources at an academic level, such as class\nequipment. Basically, there is plenty of cool, high end lab equipment you can play with to aid your\nlearning, as well as various shops in case you need to build something, as well as a bunch of software\nmade available to students at either low to no cost for them to use.\n3. There are plenty of opportunities available.\nOn top of the large variety of academic opportunities given to students through the large variety of\ncourses, there are many opportunities available as far as gaining practical experience in just about any\nsubject of choice. UROPs are quite plentiful, as well other job opportunities, for example F/ASIP or UPOP\nfor internships. As far as research goes, I believe MIT has far more opportunities available to students\nthan in many other institutions. There are also a variety of clubs in diverse subjects in which you can get\npractical experience, even if not necessarily academically oriented.\n4. The education is well rounded.\nStudents probably have a love-hate relationship with this point, but I personally find it to be good. At\nMIT students have to take courses not just in their major but in various other areas to fulfill GIRs. You\nactually have just about as many GIRs as you will end up having classes in your major. This ensures a well\nrounded education that will prepare students for a variety of challenges. People have about three to five\ncareers in their life, and while it is certainly valuable to have technical knowledge in one specific field, it\nis good to have knowledge spread around various fields to ensure preparedness for other areas.\nI also find the need for a PE requirement to be a sound one. It isn't so much at an academic education\nbasis but rather a character development basis. Forcing students to exercise is a good thing. Those who\n\ncomplain about it are probably the ones who need it the most. For those who like sports, there are\nplenty of varsity/club sports at MIT in which students can take part in.\n5. The educational style is quite unique.\nAt MIT, I find that education rather than just being focused on transferring knowledge, it focuses more\non teaching students how to learn. This works alongside the variety of learning resources available to\nstudents. It is usually the case that you won't learn all you need to in class alone and will need to consult\nexternal resources, and it is up to you to see which resources are at your disposition and choose those\nwhich will work out the best for you. By the time you graduate, if someone handed you a syllabus and a\nbook, I'm sure you would be able to figure out all you need to for a subject by yourself, one way or\nanother.\n6. There is a strong learning-oriented community.\nA large part of what really makes MIT unique is its community. MIT does a great job in admissions by\nensuring that particular characteristics are shared amongst students that will allow them to fit into the\ncommunity. Not just intellectual characteristics, but also personality-wise. Not that all MIT students are\nsimilar by a long shot, but there are certain traits that allow them to \"belong\" to the community at MIT.\nThis community promotes intellectual growth, cooperation and provides comfort in knowing that you\ncan relate to your peers.\nFrankly, I think MIT is doing a great job as far as education goes. I might be slightly biased by the fact\nthat I don't really have a large basis for comparison. As a foreigner if find MIT to simply be eons ahead of\nany given university back home, and overall to just be far ahead from any other university I can think of.\nBut only time will tell, I guess. It's still too early for me to really make a properly informed evaluation of\nthe education here. The honeymoon will be over at some point.\n\nSpecific questions: Where do you want your education to take you? What do you think it should give\nyou? How do you think MIT will help you achieve these goals?\nWhere do you want your education to take you?\nAfter graduating, I hope to be able to find a job in the field of EECS, and with time move up to a\nmanagement position. I can't think of any specifics regarding what in the field of EECS I want to do just\nyet, seeing as I haven't explored the field enough to have a specific idea.\nWhat do you think it should give you?\n1. Technical Knowledge\nFor one, I should have technical knowledge in my field. It should be in depth and complete, providing me\nall I need to know to work in the industry. As far as I know, MIT has a very strong program in EECS, which\nis excellent for me.\n2. Practical Knowledge\nOn top of the technical knowledge, I should be able to know how to apply such knowledge. Not\nnecessarily specific applications, but rather ways to think in order to apply the knowledge. This is to say\nthan rather than learning how to build a motor, I should learn the principles behind the motor and what\nthe thought process was behind its design, allowing me not to just replicate but rather to innovate.\nOn top of just knowing to apply concepts, there is a need to be able to communicate properly as well as\nbeing able to work in teams as in any career it will be necessary to communicate ideas and work in\nteams. From being able to present projects, create reports and direct teams amongst many others,\nthese are abilities that need to be developed, which is something that needs a greater focus particularly\nin fields of engineering, where studies have shown communication skills are lacking.\n\n3. Learning Techniques\nThe technical knowledge I will gain during college will eventually be outdated, probably in less than a\ndecade. Therefore, it is important for me to know how to learn by myself to stay up to date with the\nlatest advances in my field. My education should teach me techniques to learn how to learn, and do so\nin an efficient manner.\nHow do you think MIT will help you achieve these goals?\n1. A degree from MIT is quite likely to get my name in the door for interviews for job openings.\nMIT has a reputation, rightfully earned, which employers are aware of, which works to my\nadvantage. Not only that, the networking opportunities available at MIT are great, seeing as\nthere are many companies which actively seek to recruit MIT students, not to mention the many\nalums working in various companies which can help out fellow MIT students.\n2. As far as technical knowledge goes, I am sure the classes at MIT are comprehensive enough to\nfulfill that need. In course 6, there are many general classes required for the field, and on top of\nthat there are various specialized classes to take that ensure a depth of knowledge on top of the\nbreadth of knowledge.\n3. For practical knowledge, I find that even though there is a strong focus on technical knowledge,\nthere is a good focus on how to apply it. There are labs as well as design assignments and\nwhatnot which ensure that students have a good idea on how to think by themselves and apply\nthe knowledge they have earned. On top of the academic requirements, there are always\ncompetitions, clubs and UROPs at MIT where one can put their knowledge to good use.\n4. As far as learning techniques, there isn't really an option at MIT. Classes really do force you to\ndevelop efficient learning techniques, as there isn't really any other way around it.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n16.A47 The Engineer of 2020\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Week 12 & 13 Essay\nMIT is a highly respected technical institution centered around science and technology; it\nis well regarded as one of, if not the, foremost school for traditional methods of engineering\neducation. The Institute has repeatedly proven that its graduates are well prepared for the realms\nthey chose to work in. An MIT education should not only prepare students for a professional\ncareers, but also cultivate intellectual growth well beyond the standard, instill social growth so\nthat personal interactions are productive, and give the students an insight as to all the\nopportunities available to them, as MIT graduates have a high chance of being granted these\nopportunities over graduates from other schools.\nIt is a baseline of any university to prepare students for their professional lives. MIT\nshould and does do more. The Institute's aims should be to place students higher intellectually\nafter four years than they would be nearly anywhere else and give them the basis to one day\nbecome an international leader in their respective fields. The way that an MIT graduate\napproaches a problem should be innovative and efficient; it is the thought process that must be\ndisseminated just as much as the hard mathematics. A value must be placed on advancement of\nknowledge not just for the sake of passing the class, or getting a nicely padded GPA, but because\nthere will be a time when this knowledge will be called into use, possibly to enrich worldwide\nscholarship.\nMIT itself plays a minimal part in actively promoting this culture, but ensures its survival\nnonetheless. The people on campus create this style of academia. MIT's admission process does\na fantastic job of selecting people who display and promote this lifestyle both on the student and\nfaculty side. The raw material that comes in to MIT is quickly indoctrinated into this lifestyle\nand there are rarely rejections of it, as most MITers have always wanted a culture where they can\n\nfully explore the power of their intellect. However MIT proper does play a huge role in the\ndissemination of thought process. The questions that are asked at MIT in tests, quizzes, and\nproblem sets are often aimed at making the student come up with a way to solve it that can't be\nlooked up in the textbook. It will be a lovely blend of the core ideas of the class, not a\nperfunctory memorization of basic formulas. Yes, it is possible for most students to pass the\nclass using just the formulas, but the culture of wanting to intellectually excel will push the\nstudents further and make them want to understand and apply all the concepts in the class. Hence\nboth the heavy MIT course load and the rich MIT culture are necessary, and successfully\nprovided, to create outstanding scholars who can shape the future of their field.\nAll this refined intellectual power will be in vain if the proper social skills are not honed.\nMIT should offer students more ways to improve their communicative abilities with regard to\ntheir profession and their personal issues. Students should be educated so that they can talk not\nonly with fellow experts, but often more challengingly an average American who has little or no\nknowledge of the business. The HASS classes attempt to address this issue, but they tend to fall\nshort of the mark. The HASS system is primarily chaotic; the requirements are much more\ncomplex than they need to be and the system as a whole could use an overhaul. Furthermore,\nmore emphasis should be placed on communicating ideas and consequently, and unfortunately,\nless placed on strictly art centered areas; another class on how to interpret opinions will probably\nserve graduates better than a class on introduction to music theory. The communication classes\nshould not be as writing and journal centered as they are; MIT graduates are more immediately\nin need of verbal ability. The verbal communication aspect allows high caliber engineers to\nnegotiate deals with customers, perform on an interview with a potential employer, explain\n\nproblems to management, and give a public speech on research without needing an interpreter\nfor the audience.\nMIT does do a fantastic job of letting its students talk about their personal lives. The S^3\nand MedLink networks both allow students to come and talk about any personal, medical,\nfinancial, or academic issue that they might be facing. The students who are MedLinks are\nfantastically trained to interact with people in all states and have very well developed\ninterpersonal communication skills. Being able to discuss things outside the world of science and\ntechnology is a necessary part of living, and MIT provides well for development of those skills,\nespecially considering some of the levels of shyness that certain freshman enter with.\nMIT definitely offers many career opportunities in the form of UROPs, employment,\nexchange programs, and lab work. These opportunities should be continuously offered to the\nstudent populous and they are for the most part. However, MIT should actively distribute\ninformation regarding these opportunities. Many seniors have decent insight into such matters,\nbut freshman and sophomores tend to be quite inexperienced in such matters and are informed\nmostly by word of mouth from upperclassmen. While this can be effective, a more legitimate\nsystem could be installed to guarantee that a career advancing opportunity is readily available to\nthose who aren't sure where to look. MIT is doing the right thing in establishing and funding\nthese UROPs and labs, but communication regarding them could be better.\nMIT does develop students' intellect, communication abilities, and career opportunities,\nbut a few minor tweaks could be initiated. These effects culminate within the graduate and\ncombine with the reputation of MIT to give the graduate a clear advantage over rival engineering\ngraduates. The unique cultural aspect of MIT will shine through the rest of the graduate's life as\nwill the superior thinking abilities. Because MIT teaches a broad technical base and then builds\n\nupon it, rather than teaching to specific examples, MIT graduates will be much more versatile\nand therefore more valuable and productive in their field. MIT graduates have an advantage over\nschools like Cal Tech because of the overall emphasis of each institution. Both are science and\ntechnology centered, but MIT puts more emphasis on the technology part while Cal Tech prefers\nthe science aspect. In today's climate, it is probably better to be educated with a technological\norientation rather than a majority theory.\nPersonally, I want my MIT education to give me all the above. I want the prestige of an\nMIT degree, the innovative spirit and thought process, the ability to communicate my thought\neffectively, and the MIT UROP experience. I'd like to attain all these not as goals, but as means\nto an end. I need my education to take me to a well paying job whereby I could afford to put\nmyself through graduate school, if at all possible. Since America appears to be on the verge of a\nnuclear renaissance, and the rest of the world undeniably is already there, I'd like my education\nto eventually place me on the leading edge of the new nuclear powered era. I'd like to directly\ncontribute to society by producing clean, cheap, carbon-free electricity.\nMIT will help me reach these places by giving me both the technical and logical skills\nnecessary to land my dream job on the nuclear forefront. Utilizing MIT's exchange programs I\ncould potentially travel outside the US and learn nuclear power from the masters in France or an\nEast Asian nation. The biggest factors that MIT can contribute are it's intrinsic atmosphere and\nmethodology. This innovative ability will place me head and shoulders above my competition\nand make me very valuable to my employer and to the energy consumers of tomorrow. MIT will\ngive my classmates and I the knowledge and skills necessary to advance society and ourselves to\nnew levels of finance, intellect, and efficiency.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n16.A47 The Engineer of 2020\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "MIT and the Engineer of 2020\nI believe that MIT has earned its place as the top University for Engineering in the world.\nFrom my own experience and from various sources of reports and statistics, it is clear that MIT\nis doing the best any university can in order to prepare its students for the future. According to\nthe National Academy of Engineering's project \"The Engineer of 2020\", the engineer of 2020\nneeds to develop strong analytical skills, practical ingenuity, good communication skills with\nmultiple stakeholders, business and management skills, ethical standards, become lifelong\nlearners, and have the ability to frame problems in operational and socio-technical contexts.\nAccording to the report of the Task Force on the Undergraduate Educational Commons in\n2006, MIT has been working toward those very goals and most of those qualities have been an\nintrinsic part of MIT culture for decades. Many of MIT's attributes contribute towards how well it\nis preparing its students for the future, and I feel that it is the perfect fit for me and my goals.\nOne of these attributes is the collaborative nature of the Institute. MIT has a long\ntradition of collaborative work among its graduate and undergraduate students, especially on\nproblem sets within certain communities. On certain problem sets, one of the first requirements\nis to list the names of students you worked with on the assignment. Also, in UROPs\n(undergraduate research opportunity programs) or any research at the Institute, the tasks are\ndivided into specific parts so that the whole research group has to work as a team to complete\na goal. So, this collaborative nature is something that is necessary for any student who wants\na career in science or engineering because often the work is completed through teams.\nThe general institute requirements (GIRs) provide MIT students with a good foundation\nin communication skills, the principles necessary for a degree in any area of science or\n\nengineering, and also forms a shared cultural experience among incoming students. The GIRs\nalso provide students with an integrated experience of professional and liberal education.\nThere is an emphasis on \"useful\" knowledge, which was something the founder of MIT, William\nBarton Rogers, thought very highly of. One of MIT's values is employing useful knowledge in\norder to harness the power of technology to be used for the betterment of society. This\nemphasis on societal responsibility means that the MIT curriculum focuses on more in depth\ncovering of concepts rather than brief coverings of facts. In this way, the curriculum seems\nsuited towards one of the necessary skills of the engineer of 2020: MIT students develop\nthinking skills rather than amassing outdated knowledge, they are provided with the motivation\nfor continuous learning and self-education, and learn strong analytical skills so that they can\nsolve problems in many different contexts instead of memorizing items case by case.\nThe rigor of MIT's curriculum is well known, and is also an important component in how\nMIT prepares its students for their futures beyond the Institute. Most undergraduates do not\ntreat the Bachelor of Science degree as the final degree, and 60% go on to higher education\n(i.e. graduate school). So, since MIT has such a rigorous undergraduate curriculum, most\nstudents who go on to graduate school feel they were very prepared for the more advanced\nwork a Master's or Ph.D requires.\nMany institutions of higher education are emphasizing shifts that will allow their students\nto become leaders in the future. These shifts include international awareness, a more rigorous\ncore curriculum, a change in the focus of new student orientations, and an emphasis on\ndepartment integration. Reports from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton show that these areas are\nin need of an overhaul, and MIT's Task Force report also showed similar findings. This shows\nthat MIT and other institutions of higher learning within the United States agree on changes\n\nthat need to be made in order to meet the challenges of 2020, and that this competition in\ncurriculum changes is a healthy one.\nMIT provides international awareness for its students through study abroad programs\nsuch as MISTI and the Cambridge/MIT exchange. Also, there are globalization courses\nprovided with the intention of giving undergraduate students more information about where\nthey stand in a global context . Since many believe that the world is becoming \"flat\" in the\nsense that international relationships are becoming more attainable, it is becoming increasingly\nimportant to give students a global perspective.\nHowever, according to the RAND report, the United States may be in danger of\nbecoming less of a leader in science and technology because other countries are producing\nskilled engineers at a higher rate. Engineers will be even more important in the future as the\nworld faces pressing problems such as an aging population, energy and environmental needs,\nmedical issues within biological engineering, and population growth. Fortunately, MIT is\nproducing many more engineers than its competitors and so in this way it will probably become\neven more successful in the future. So, I believe that MIT is doing the right things to prepare\nme for the future, because it has such a strong sense of societal responsibility and is changing\nto meet the needs of the future. One example is the fact that MIT has instated a new minor\ncalled the Energy minor, meant to increase awareness about alternative forms of energy\n(which is a pressing matter now, and will only continue to become a more critical issue).\nThough MIT has been preparing its students very well so far in terms of meeting the\nneeds of the future, there is still some room for improvement. For example, the GIRs perhaps\nshould include a computer requirement. It would not have to be a programming course, but at\nleast something to provide students with an introduction to a tool that will be so crucial to their\n\nsuccess as a scientist, engineer, architect, etc. This, or an engineering requirement, would\ngive students an opportunity to explore options they may not have had in high school. Most\nstudents (if not all) come to MIT with backgrounds in math, physics, biology, chemistry, etc.\nHowever, not quite as many students are privileged enough to have been exposed to a\nrigorous computer or engineering course. I was able to take both types of courses while in high\nschool and I feel I have benefited from the exposure immensely, but anyone who was not able\nto take courses in those areas could feel uninterested in trying them for the first time at MIT\nwithout the support of a freshman group. Another area that MIT could improve on would be the\narea of advising. Within the Task Force report, it was mentioned that advising should seek to\nintegrate the aspects of community, academics, and research at MIT. This would provide\nstudents with a more unified experience and they would feel more confident in their abilities to\nmove between separate areas. Also, MIT could put even more emphasis on global context,\nbeyond MISTI and other abroad programs. There could be a requirement to fulfill a \"significant\ninternational experience\" (something Harvard requires), or more classes could be offered that\nallow students to learn how to solve problems in an international environment (with an\nemphasis on how to handle cultural differences and a deeper understanding of foreign\neconomies).\nBefore coming to MIT, I had been used to a small high school that was pretty relaxed (it\nwas an art school). MIT provided me with the opportunity to make the transition to college life\nthrough one of its freshman programs, ESG (Experimental Study Group). ESG has provided\nme with an amazing community of freshmen and upperclassmen, as well as an extraordinary\narray of faculty. So far, MIT has provided me with what I need out of an institution, a\ncommunity that supports me and students who I can work with collaboratively. I also want to\n\ndevelop very strong analytic and creative skills from my education at MIT, and according to the\nTask Force report most alumni said that \"creativity and the ability to deal with new challenges\",\nwere two of the greatest contributions that MIT made to their adult lives. I also really want to\nhave a strong community after I leave MIT, and from what I have seen of MIT alumni they are\nall very well connected. I also plan on going to graduate school (perhaps getting a Ph.D,\ndepending on whether or not I go into Engineering or Science), and according to recent data\n74% of MIT students that apply to graduate schools get in to the top ten graduate schools.\nAlso, I want to have an education that will prepare me for work abroad. MIT would prepare me\nfor this through programs like MISTI and IROPs. MIT's reputation and rigorous curriculum will\nenable me to live a life of intense curiosity, fulfilling research, and creation. Since I am\nimmersed in a diverse student body, I will also be more prepared for the changing\ndemographics that will affect the work force (in 2000 the engineering work force was 93%\nasian/white, in 2020 it is estimated to be only 69.4% asian/white), and I welcome this change.\nEssentially, MIT and many other institutions are constantly adapting in order to meet the\nchallenges of the future. I feel that MIT will instill in me that same ability to adjust to swiftly\nchanging technologies so that I can meet the challenges of 2020 and beyond.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n16.A47 The Engineer of 2020\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
