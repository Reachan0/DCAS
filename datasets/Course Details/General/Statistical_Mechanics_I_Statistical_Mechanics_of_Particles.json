Filament:\nFor an elastic filament it is found that, at a finite range in temperature, a\ndisplacement x requires a force\nJ = ax -bT + cTx,\nwhere a, b, and c are constants. Furthermore, its heat capacity at constant displacement\nis proportional to temperature, i.e. Cx = A(x)T.\n(a) Use an appropriate Maxwell relation to calculate ∂S/∂x| .\nT\n(b) Show that A has to in fact be independent of x, i.e. dA/dx = 0.\n(c) Give the expression for S(T, x) assuming S(0, 0) = S0.\n(d) Calculate the heat capacity at constant tension, i.e. CJ = T ∂S/∂T|J as a function of\nT and J.\n********\n2.\nHard core gas:\nA gas obeys the equation of state P(V - Nb) = NkBT, and has a\nheat capacity CV independent of temperature.

Superconducting transition: Many metals become superconductors at low temperatures\nT, and magnetic fields B. The heat capacities of the two phases at zero magnetic field are\napproximately given by\nCs(T) = V αT 3\nin the superconducting phase\n,\n[\n]\nCn(T) = V\nβT 3 + γT\nin the normal phase\nwhere V is the volume, and {α, β, γ} are constants.

Use this information to obtain the\ntransition temperature Tc, as a function of α, β, and γ.\n(c) At zero temperature, the electrons in the superconductor form bound Cooper pairs.\nAs a result, the internal energy of the superconductor is reduced by an amount V Δ, i.e.\nEn(T = 0) = E0 and Es(T = 0) = E0 -V Δ for the metal and superconductor, respectively.\nCalculate the internal energies of both phases at finite temperatures.\n(d) By comparing the Gibbs free energies (or chemical potentials) in the two phases, obtain\nan expression for the energy gap Δ in terms of α, β, and γ.\n(e) In the presence of a magnetic field B, inclusion of magnetic work results in dE =\nTdS+BdM +μdN, where M is the magnetization. The superconducting phase is a perfect\ndiamagnet, expelling the magnetic field from its interior, such that Ms = -V B/(4π) in\nappropriate units. The normal metal can be regarded as approximately non-magnetic,\nwith Mn = 0.

Photon gas Carnot cycle:\nThe aim of this problem is to obtain the blackbody ra\ndiation relation, E(T, V ) ∝ V T 4, starting from the equation of state, by performing an\ninfinitesimal Carnot cycle on the photon gas.\nP\nV\nV+dV\nP+dP\nT\nT+dT\nP\nV\n(a) Express the work done, W, in the above cycle, in terms of dV and dP.\n\n(b) Express the heat absorbed, Q, in expanding the gas along an isotherm, in terms of P,\ndV , and an appropriate derivative of E(T, V ).\n(c) Using the efficiency of the Carnot cycle, relate the above expressions for W and Q to\nT and dT.\n(d) Observations indicate that the pressure of the photon gas is given by P = AT 4 ,\nwhere A = π2k4 /45 ( hc) is a constant.

Irreversible Processes:\n(a) Consider two substances, initially at temperatures T 0 and T 0, coming to equilibrium\nat a final temperature Tf through heat exchange.

The change in the entropy of\nthe bath is given by\nΔQbath\nΔQgas\nΔSbath =\n= -\n= -\n(ΔEgas + PΔVgas) .\nT\nT\nT\nBy considering the change in entropy of the combined system establish that \"the equilibrium\nof a gas at fixed T and P is characterized by the minimum of the Gibbs free energy G =\nE + PV -TS.\"\n********\n6. Constant heat capacities:\nConsider two bodies with temperature independent heat\ncapacities C1 and C2, and initial temperatures T1 > T2.\n(a) If the two bodies are brought into contact such that the only heat exchange is between\nthem, what is the final temperature TF , and what is the change in entropy.\n\n(b) What is the final temperature if a Carnot engine is used to transfer heat between the\ntwo bodies? What is the amount of work done by the engine in this case?\n********\n7. Non-Carnot Engine:\nConsider an engine that operates between a set of temperatures\nTmax = T1 > T2 > T3 > · · · > Tn = Tmin. For a subset of these temperatures {T +},\nα\n-\nthe engine takes in heat {Q+}; while at the remaining temperatures {T\n}, heat {Q-}\nα\nβ\nβ\nis released. The engine does a net work W = Q+ - Q-, and its efficiency is given by\nL\nL\nη = W/Q+, where Q+ =\nQ+ and Q- =\nQ- . Show that this efficiency is less than\nα\nα\nβ\nβ\nthat of a Carnot engine operating between Tmax and Tmin.\n********\n8. (Optional) The solar system\noriginated from a dilute gas of particles, sufficiently\nseparated from other such clouds to be regarded as an isolated system. Under the action\nof gravity the particles coalesced to form the sun and planets.\n(a) The motion and organization of planets is much more ordered than the original dust\ncloud. Why does this not violate the second law of thermodynamics?\n(b) The nuclear processes of the sun convert protons to heavier elements such as carbon.\nDoes this further organization lead to a reduction in entropy?\n(c) The evolution of life and intelligence requires even further levels of organization. How\nis this achieved on earth without violating the second law?\n********\n+ Reviewing the problems and solutions provided on the course web-page for preparation\nfor Test 1 should help you with the above problems.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The gold atoms fly o\nin all directions, and a portion of them\nsticks to the glass (or to other gold atoms already on the glass plate).

Semi-flexible polymer in two dimensions\nConfigurations of a model polymer can be\ndescribed by either a set of vectors {ti} of length a in two dimensions (for i = 1, · · · , N),\nor alternatively by the angles {φi} between successive vectors, as indicated in the figure\nbelow.\nt 1\nt 2\nt 3\nt N-1\nt N\nR\nøN-1\nø 1\n\nThe polymer is at a temperature T , and subject to an energy\nN-1\nN-1\nX\nX\nH = -κ\nti · ti+1 = -κa2\ncos φi\n,\ni=1\ni=1\nwhere κ is related to the bending rigidity, such the probability of any configuration is\nproportional to exp (-H/kBT ).\n(a) Show that htm · tni ∝ exp (-|n - m|/ξ), and obtain an expression for the persistence\nlength lp = aξ.

Foraging:\nTypical foraging behavior consists of a random search for food, followed by\na quick return to the nest. For this problem, assume that the nest is at the origin, and the\nsearch consists of a random walk in two dimensions around the nest.\n(a) Modeling the search as a random walk with di usion constant D, what is the probability\ndensity for the searcher to be a distance r from the nest, at a time t after leaving the nest?\n(b) Assume that durations of search segments are exponentially distributed, i.e.\nwith\n-t/\nprobability p(t) ∝ e\n. Further assume that the times spent in returning to the nest,\nand stay at nest between searches, are negligible compared to search times. After times\nmuch longer than τ, what is the probability to find the searcher at a distance r from the\nnest. Use saddle-point integration to find the asymptotic probability for large r.\n********\n4. Jensen's inequality and Kullback-Liebler divergence:\nA convex function f(x) always\nlies above the tangent at any point, i.e. f(x) ≥ f(y) + f ′(y)(x - y) for all y.\n(a) Show that for a convex function hf(x)i ≥ f(hxi).\n(b) The Kullback-Liebler divergence of two probability distributions p(x) and q(x) is\nR\ndefined as D(p|q) ≡\ndx p(x) ln [p(x)/q(x)].\nUse Jensen's inequality to prove that\nD(p|q) ≥ 0.\n********\n5. The book of records:\nConsider a sequence of random numbers {x1, x2, · · · , xn, · · ·}; the\nentry xn is a record if it is larger than all numbers before it, i.e. if xn > {x1, x2, · · · , xn-1}.\nWe can then define an associated sequence of indicators {R1, R2, · · · , Rn, · · ·} in which\nRn = 1 if xn is a record, and Rn = 0 if it is not (clearly R1 = 1).\n(a) Assume that each entry xn is taken independently from the same probability distri\nbution p(x). [In other words, {xn} are IIDs (independent identically distributed).] Show\n\nthat, irrespective of the form of p(x), there is a very simple expression for the probability\nPn that the entry xn is a record.\n(b) The records are entered in the Guinness Book of Records. What is the average number\nhSN i of records after N attempts, and how does it grow for N ≫ 1? If the number of\ntrials, e.g. the number of participants in a sporting event, doubles every year, how does\nthe number of entries asymptotically grow with time.\n(c) Prove that hRnRmic = 0 for m 6= n. (The record indicators indicators {Rn} are in fact\nindependent random variables, though not identical, which is a stronger statement than\nthe vanishing of the covariance.)\n(d) Compute all moments, and the first three cumulants of the total number of records\nSN after N entries. Does the central limit theorem apply to SN ?\n(e) (Optional) The first record, of course occurs for n1 = 1. If the third record occurs at\ntrial number n3 = 9, what is the mean value hn2i for the position of the second record?\nWhat is the mean value hn4i for the position of the fourth record?\n********\n6. Jarzynski equality:\nIn equilibrium at a temperature T , the probability that a macro\nscopic system is in a microstate μ is p(μ) = exp [-βH(μ)] /Z, where H(μ) is the energy of\nthe microstate, β = 1/(kBT ), and the normalization factor is related to the free energy by\n-βF = ln Z. We now change the macroscopic state of the system by performing external\nwork W , such that the new state is also in equilibrium at temperature T . For example,\nimagine that the volume of a gas in changed by moving a piston as L(t) = L1 +(L2 -L1)t/τ.\nDepending on the protocol (e.g. the speed u = (L2 -L1)/τ), the process may be close to or\nfar from reversible. Nonetheless, the Jarzynski equality relates the probability distribution\nfor the work W to the equilibrium change in free energy!\n(a) Assume that the process by which work is performed is fully deterministic, in the sense\nthat for a given protocol, any initial microstate μ will evolve to a specific final microstate\n′\nμ . The amount of work performed W (μ) will vary with the initial microstate, and there is\nthus a probability distribution pf (W ) which can be related to the equilibrium p(μ). The\nenergy of the final microstate, however, is precisely H ′ (μ ′) = H(μ) + W (μ). Time reversal\nsymmetry implies that if we now instantaneously reverse all the momenta, and proceed\naccording to the reversed protocol, the time-reversed microstate μ ′ will deterministically\nevolve back to microstate μ, and the work -W (μ) is recovered. However, rather than\n\ndoing so, we first allow the system to equilibrate into its new macrostate at temperature\nT , before reversing the protocol to recover the work. The recovered work -W will now be\na function of the selected microstate, and distributed according to a di erent probability\n\n′\npb(-W ), related to p ′(μ ′) = exp -βH ′ (μ ′) /Z . It is in general not possible to find pf (W )\nor pb(-W ). However, by noting that the probabilities of a pair of time-reversed microstates\nare exactly equal, show that their ratio is given by\npf (W ) = exp [β(W + F - F ′ )] .\npb(-W )\nWhile you were guided to prove the above result with specific assumptions, it is in fact\nmore generally valid, and known as the work-fluctuation theorem.\n(b) Prove the Jarzynski equality\n\nZ\n′\n- W\nW\n∆F ≡ F - F = -kBT ln e\n≡-kBT ln\ndW pf (W )e-\n.\nThis result can in principle be used to compute equilibrium free energy di erences from\nan ensemble of non-equilibrium measurements of the work. For example, in Liphardt, et.\nal., Science 296, 1832 (2002), the work needed to stretch a single RNA molecule was\ncalculated and related to the free energy change. However, the number of trials must be\nlarge enough to ensure that the averaged exponential, which is dominated by rare events,\nis accurately obtained.\n(c) Use the Jarzynski equality to prove the familiar thermodynamic inequality\nhW i ≥ ∆F\n.\n(d) Consider a cycle in which a work W - ω is performed in the first stage, and work\n-W is returned in the reversed process. According to the second law of thermodynamics,\nthe net gain ω must be positive. However, within statistical physics, it is always possible\nthat this condition is violated. Use the above results to conclude that the probability of\nviolating the second law decays with the degree of violation according to\n- !\nPviolating second law(ω > 0) ≤ e\n.\n********\n\n+ Two relevant articles: (i) On the Jarzynski relation, G.E.

Because of the electrostatic repulsion of the charges\nleft behind, the polymer stretches out into a cylinder of radius a, as in the figure below.\nWhile thermal fluctuations favor ions wandering in the solvent, electrostatic attractions\nprefer their return and condensation on the polymer.

Exciton dissociation in a semiconductor: By shining an intense laser beam on a semicon\nductor, one can create a metastable collection of electrons (charge -e, and effective mass\nme) and holes (charge +e, and effective mass mh) in the bulk.

The Manning Transition: When ionic polymers (polyelectrolytes) such as DNA are\nimmersed in water, the negatively charged counter-ions go into solution, leaving behind\na positively charged polymer. Because of the electrostatic repulsion of the charges left\nbehind, the polymer stretches out into a cylinder of radius a, as illustrated in the figure.\nWhile thermal fluctuations tend to make the ions wander about in the solvent, electrostatic\nattractions favor their return and condensation on the polymer. If the number of counter\nions is N, they interact with the N positive charges left behind on the rod through the\npotential U (r) = -2 (Ne/L) ln (r/L), where r is the radial coordinate in a cylindrical\ngeometry. If we ignore the Coulomb repulsion between counter-ions, they can be described\nby the classical Hamiltonian\nN\n\n=\nX\npi\n+ 2e 2 n ln\nr\n,\nH\n2m\nL\ni=1\nwhere n = N/L.\n\nL\nR\n2a\nr\nz\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(a) For a cylindrical container of radius R, calculate the canonical partition function Z in\nterms of temperature T, density n, and radii R and a.\n(b) Calculate the probability distribution function p (r) for the radial position of a counter\nion, and its first moment ⟨r⟩, the average radial position of a counter-ion.\n(c) The behavior of the results calculated above in the limit R ≫a is very different at high\nand low temperatures.

In particular, how does ⟨r⟩depend on R and a in each case?\n(d) Calculate the pressure exerted by the counter-ions on the wall of the container, at\nr = R, in the limit R ≫a, at all temperatures.\n(e) The character of the transition examined in part (d) is modified if the Coulomb in\nteractions between counter-ions are taken into account. An approximate approach to the\ninteracting problem is to allow a fraction N1 of counter-ions to condense along the polymer\nrod, while the remaining N2 = N -N1 fluctuate in the solvent. The free counter-ions are\nagain treated as non-interacting particles, governed by the Hamiltonian\nN\n\nX\n=\npi + 2e 2 n2 ln\nr\n,\nH\n2m\nL\ni=1\nwhere n2 = N2/L.

Because of the full (position\nand spin) antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions, this interaction may be described\nas an effective spin-spin coupling which favors states with parallel spins.\nIn a simple\napproximation, the effect of this interaction is represented by adding a potential\nU = αN+N-,\nV\nto the Hamiltonian, where N+ and N- = N -N+ are the numbers of electrons with up and\ndown spins, and V is the volume.

The Manning Transition: When ionic polymers (polyelectrolytes) such as DNA are\nimmersed in water, the negatively charged counter-ions go into solution, leaving behind\na positively charged polymer. Because of the electrostatic repulsion of the charges left\nbehind, the polymer stretches out into a cylinder of radius a, as illustrated in the figure.\nWhile thermal fluctuations tend to make the ions wander about in the solvent, electrostatic\nattractions favor their return and condensation on the polymer. If the number of counter\nions is N, they interact with the N positive charges left behind on the rod through the\n\n(\n)\nZ\npotential U (r) = -2 (Ne/L) ln (r/L), where r is the radial coordinate in a cylindrical\ngeometry.

Identify the transition temperature, and characterize the nature of\nthe two phases. In particular, how does hri depend on R and a in each case?\nConsider first low temperatures, such that e2n/kBT > 1.\nIn the R ≫a limit, the\n-\ndistribution function becomes\ne2n\n1-2e 2n/kBT\nr\np (r) = 2\n1 -kBT\na2(1-e2n/kBT ) ,\nand hri ∝a. To see this, either examine the above calculated average hri in the R ≫a\nlimit, or notice that\np (r) dr = 2\n1 -k\ne\nB\nn\nT\nx 1-2e 2n/kBT dx,\nwhere x = r/a, immediately implying hri ∝a (as\ninfdxx1-2e 2n/kBT < infif e2n/kBT > 1).\nOn the other hand, at high temperatures (e2n/kBT < 1), the distribution function reduces\nto\ne2n\n1-2e 2n/kBT\nr\np (r) = 2\n1 -kBT\nR2(1-e2n/kBT ) ,\nand hri ∝R, from similar arguments.\nThus, at temperature Tc = e2n/kB there is a\ntransition from a \"condensed\" phase, in which the counter-ions are stuck on the polymer,\nto a \"gas\" phase, in which the counter-ions fluctuate in water at typical distances from\nthe polymer which are determined by the container size.\n(d) Calculate the pressure exerted by the counter-ions on the wall of the container, at\nr = R, in the limit R ≫a, at all temperatures.\n- The work done by the counter-ions to expand the container from a radius R to a radius\nR + dR is\ndW = dF = (force) dR = -P (2πRL)dR,\n\nZ\nleading to\n∂F\nkBT ∂lnZ\nP =\n=\n.\n-2πRL ∂R\n2πRL ∂R\nAt low temperatures, T < Tc, the pressure vanishes, since the partition function is inde\npendent of R in the limit R ≫a.

An approximate approach to the\ninteracting problem is to allow a fraction N1 of counter-ions to condense along the polymer\nrod, while the remaining N2 = N -N1 fluctuate in the solvent. The free counter-ions are\nagain treated as non-interacting particles, governed by the Hamiltonian\nN\n\n=\nX pi + 2e 2 n2 ln\nr\n,\nH\n2m\nL\ni=1\nwhere n2 = N2/L. Guess the equilibrium number of non-interacting ions, N2\n∗, and justify\nyour guess by discussing the response of the system to slight deviations from N2\n∗. (This is\na qualitative question for which no new calculations are needed.)\nConsider a deviation (n2) from n∗\n2 ≡N2\n∗/V ≡kBT/e2, occuring at a temperature lower\n-\nthan Tc (i.e. e2n/kBT > 1). If n2 > n2\n∗, the counter-ions have a tendency to condensate\n(since e2n/kBT > 1), thus decreasing n2. On the other hand, if n2 > n2\n∗, the counter-ions\ntend to \"evaporate\" (since e2n/kBT < 1). In both cases, the system drives the density n2\nto the (equilibrium) value of n∗\n2 = kBT/e2 . If the temperature is higher than Tc, clearly\nn∗\n2 = n and there is no condensation.\n********\n3.

Hard rods: A collection of N asymmetric molecules in two dimensions may be modeled\nas a gas of rods, each of length 2l and lying in a plane. A rod can move by translation of\nits center of mass and rotation about latter, as long as it does not encounter another rod.\nWithout treating the hard-core interaction exactly, we can incorporate it approximately\nby assuming that the rotational motion of each rod is restricted (by the other rods) to an\nangle θ, which in turn introduces an excluded volume Ω (θ) (associated with each rod).\nThe value of θ is then calculated self consistently by maximizing the entropy at a given\ndensity n = N/V , where V is the total accessible area.\nθ\n2l\nexcluded\nvolume\n\n\"\n#\n(a) Write down the entropy of such a collection of rods in terms of N, n, Ω, and A (θ),\nthe entropy associated to the rotational freedom of a single rod.

The equilibrium value of θ increases\nas the density is decreased, up to its \"optimal\" value θc at nc, and θ (n < nc) = θc.

Hence find the ratio\nkBTcnc/Pc.\n- Mechanical stability of the gas requires that any spontaneous change in volume should be\nopposed by a compensating change in pressure. This corresponds to δPδV < 0, and since\nδn = -(N/V 2)δV , any equation of state must have a pressure that is an increasing func\ntion of density. The transition point between pressure isotherms that are monotonically\nincreasing functions of n, and those that are not (hence manifestly incorrect) is obtained\nby the usual conditions of dP/dn = 0 and d2P/dn2 = 0.

Graphene is a single sheet of carbon atoms bonded into a two dimensional hexagonal\nlattice. It can be obtained by exfoliation (repeated peeling) of graphite. The band struc\nture of graphene is such that the single particles excitations behave as relativistic Dirac\nfermions, with a spectrum that at low energies can be approximated by\nE±(k) = ± hv k\n.\nThere is spin degeneracy of g = 2, and v\n106ms-1 . Recent experiments on unusual\n≈\ntransport properties of graphene were reported in Nature 438, 197 (2005). In this problem,\nyou shall calculate the heat capacity of this material.\n(a) If at zero temperature all negative energy states are occupied and all positive energy\nones are empty, find the chemical potential μ(T ).\n- According to Fermi statistics, the probability of occupation of a state of of energy E is\neβ(μ-E)n\np [n(E)] =\n,\nfor\nn = 0, 1.\n1 + eβ(μ-E)\nFor a state of energy μ + δ,\neβδn\neβδ\np [n(μ + δ)] = 1 + eβδ ,\n= ⇒\np [n(μ + δ) = 1] =\neβδ =\ne-βδ .\n1 +\n1 +\nSimilarly, for a state of energy μ -δ,\ne-βδn\np [n(μ -δ)] = 1 + e-βδ ,\n= ⇒\np [n(μ -δ) = 0] = 1 + e-βδ = p [n(μ + δ) = 1] ,\ni.e. the probability of finding an occupied state of energy μ + δ is the same as that of\nfinding an unoccupied state of energy μ -δ.\nAt zero temperature all negative energy Dirac states are occupied and all positive\nenergy ones are empty, i.e. μ(T = 0) = 0. The above result implies that for μ = 0,\nhn(E)i + hn -E)i is unchanged for all temperatures; any particle leaving an occupied\nnegative energy state goes to the corresponding unoccupied positive energy state. Adding\nup all such energies, we conclude that the total particle number is unchanged if μ stays at\nzero.

The typical sound velocity in graphite is of the order of 2×104ms-1 . Is the\nlow temperature heat capacity of graphene controlled by phonon or electron contributions?\n- The single particle excitations for phonons also have a linear spectrum, with Ep = hvp|k|\nand correspond to μ = 0. Thus qualitatively they give the same type of contribution to\nenergy and heat capacity. The difference is only in numerical pre-factors.

Squeezed chain: A rubber band is modeled as a single chain of N massless links of fixed\nlength a. The chain is placed inside a narrow tube that restricts each link to point parallel\nor anti-parallel to the tube.\n(a) Ignoring any interactions amongst the links, give the number of configurations of the\nchain, Ω(L, N), where L is the end-to-end length of the chain.\n- A typical configuration will have N+ steps in one direction, and N-steps in the opposite\ndirection, such that\nL = (N+ -N-)a,\nand\nN = N+ + N-,\nor equivalently\nN ± L/a\nN\n=\n.\n±\nThe number of configurations is given by the binomial formula\nN!\nN!\nΩ(L, N) =\n=\n.\nN+!N-!\n[(N + L/a)/2]![(N -L/a)/2]!\n(b) Use Stirling's approximation to express the result for entropy as a function of N and\nx = L/(Na).\n- Using Stirling's approximation\nS\nkB\n= ln Ω ≈N ln N -N+ ln N+ -N-ln N-\nN\n= N ln 2 -\n[(1 + x) ln(1 + x) + (1 -x) ln(1 -x)] .\n\ns\n\nThe tube is now uniformly squeezed such that stretched configurations are energet\nically favored.

Graphene bilayer: The layers of graphite can be peeled apart through different exfo\nliation processes. Many such processes generate single sheets of carbon atoms, as well as\nbilayers in which the two sheets are weakly coupled. The hexagonal lattice of the single\nlayer graphene, leads to a band structure that at low energies can be approximated by\n1 layer (k) =\n(ak), as in relativistic Dirac fermions. (Here k = k, a is a lattice spac-\nE±\n±tk\ning, and t\nis a typical in-plane hopping energy.) A weak hopping energy t\nbetween the\nk\n⊥\ntwo sheets of the bilayer modifies the low energy excitations drastically, to\nt2\nbilayer (k) =\nk (ka)2\n,\nE±\n±2t⊥\ni.e. resembling massive Dirac fermions. In addition to the spin degeneracy, there are two\nbranches of such excitations per unit cell, for an overall degeneracy of g = 4.\n(a) For the undoped material with one electron per site, at zero temperature all negative\nenergy states are occupied and all positive energy ones are empty.\nFind the chemical\npotential μ(T ).\n- According to Fermi statistics, the probability of occupation of a state of of energy E is\neβ(μ-E)n\np [n(E)] =\n,\nfor\nn = 0, 1.\n1 + eβ(μ-E)\nFor a state of energy μ + δ,\neβδn\neβδ\np [n(μ + δ)] = 1 + eβδ ,\n= ⇒\np [n(μ + δ) = 1] = 1 + eβδ = 1 + e-βδ .\nSimilarly, for a state of energy μ -δ,\ne-βδn\np [n(μ -δ)] = 1 + e-βδ ,\n= ⇒\np [n(μ -δ) = 0] = 1 + e-βδ = p [n(μ + δ) = 1] ,\ni.e. the probability of finding an occupied state of energy μ + δ is the same as that of\nfinding an unoccupied state of energy μ -δ.\nAt zero temperature all negative energy Dirac states are occupied and all positive\nenergy ones are empty, i.e. μ(T = 0) = 0. The above result implies that for μ = 0,\nhn(E)i + hn -E)i is unchanged for all temperatures; any particle leaving an occupied\nnegative energy state goes to the corresponding unoccupied positive energy state. Adding\nup all such energies, we conclude that the total particle number is unchanged if μ stays at\nzero. Thus, the particle-hole symmetry enforces μ(T ) = 0.\n\nZ\nX\nZ\nZ\nZ\nk\n\n!\nk\n(b) Show that the mean excitation energy of this system at finite temperature satisfies\nE(T ) -E(0) = 2gA\n(2\nd\nπ\n2k\n)2 exp\n\nβ\nE\nE\n+\n+\n(\n(\nk\nk\n)\n)\n\n+ 1\n.\n- Using the label +(-) for the positive (energy) states, the excitation energy is calculated\nas\nE(T ) -E(0) =\n[hn+(k)i E+(k) + (1 -hn-(k)i) E-(k)]\nk,sz,α\nX\nd2k\nE+(k)\n= g\n= 2gA\n\n.\nk\n2 hn+(k)i E+(k)\n(2π)2 exp βE+(k)\n+ 1\n(c) Give a closed form answer for the excitation energy of the bilayer by evaluating the\nabove integral.\n- Let E+(k) = αk2, with α = (tka)2/(2t⊥), to get\nE(T ) -E(0) = 2gA\ninf2πkdk\nαk2\n=\n(set βαk2 = x)\n4π2\neβαk2 + 1\ngA\nkBT\ninf\nx\n=\nkBT\ndx\n2π\nα\nex + 1\n\ngπ\nkBT\nπ A\nkBT\n=\nAkBT\n=\nt\nα\n3 a2\nt\n⊥.\nFor the final expression, we have noted that the needed integral is f2\n-(1), and used f2\n-(1) =\nζ2/2 = π2/12.\n(d) Calculate the heat capacity, CA, of such massive Dirac particles.\n- The heat capacity can now be evaluated as\n∂E\n2π A\nkBTt\nCA = ∂T\nA\n= 3 a2 kB\nt2\n⊥\n.\n(e) A sample contains an equal proportion of single and bilayers. Estimate (in terms of the\nhopping energies) the temperature below which the electronic heat capacity is dominated\nby the bilayers.\n- As stated earlier, the monolayer excitations for phonons have a linear spectrum, with\nE1 layer = ±tk(ka). Their contribution to energy and heat capacity can be calculated as\n\nZ\nk\nk\nbefore. Including the various prefactors (which are not required for the solution), we have\nE1 layer(T ) = 2gA\ninf2πkdk\ntkak\n=\n(set βt ak = x)\n4π2\neβt∥ak + 1\nk\ngA\nkBT 2 Z inf\nx\n=\nkBT\ndx\nπ\ntka\nex + 1\n\n∝a\nA kBT\nkB\nt\nT\n,\nC1 layer ∝a\nA kB\nkB\nt\nT\n.\nA\nThe bilayer heat capacity, which is proportional to T is more important at lower temper\natures. By comparing the two expressions, it is apparent that the electronic heat capacity\nper particle is larger in the bilayer for temperatures smaller than T ∗ ≈t⊥/kB.\n********\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Surface tension:\nThermodynamic properties of the interface between two phases are\ndescribed by a state function called the surface tension S. It is defined in terms of the\nwork required to increase the surface area by an amount dA through dW\n\n= SdA.\n(a) By considering the work done against surface tension in an infinitesimal change in\nradius, show that the pressure inside a spherical drop of water of radius R is larger than\noutside pressure by 2S/R. What is the air pressure inside a soap bubble of radius R?\n(b) A water droplet condenses on a solid surface. There are three surface tensions involved\nSaw, Ssw, and Ssa, where a, s, and w refer to air, solid and water respectively. Calculate\nthe angle of contact, and find the condition for the appearance of a water film (complete\nwetting).\n(c) In the realm of \"large\" bodies gravity is the dominant force, while at \"small\" distances\nsurface tension effects are all important.\nAt room temperature, the surface tension of\nwater is So ≈7×10-2Nm-1 . Estimate the typical length-scale that separates \"large\" and\n\"small\" behaviors. Give a couple of examples for where this length-scale is important.\n********\n2. Surfactants:\nSurfactant molecules such as those in soap or shampoo prefer to spread\non the air-water surface rather than dissolve in water. To see this, float a hair on the\nsurface of water and gently touch the water in its vicinity with a piece of soap. (This is\nalso why a piece of soap can power a toy paper boat.)\n(a) The air-water surface tension So (assumed to be temperature independent) is reduced\nroughly by NkBT/A, where N is the number of surfactant particles, and A is the area.\nExplain this result qualitatively.\n(b) Place a drop of water on a clean surface. Observe what happens to the air-water\nsurface contact angle as you gently touch the droplet surface with a small piece of soap,\nand explain the observation.\n(c) More careful observations show that at higher surfactant densities\n\n∂S\n=\nNkBT\n2a\nN\n,\nand\n∂T\n=\nA -Nb ;\n∂A T\n(A -Nb)2 -A\nA\n∂S A\n- NkB\nwhere a and b are constants.

Temperature scales:\nProve the equivalence of the ideal gas temperature scale Θ, and\nthe thermodynamic scale T, by performing a Carnot cycle on an ideal gas. The ideal gas\n\nsatisfies PV = NkBΘ, and its internal energy E is a function of Θ only. However, you\nmay not assume that E ∝Θ. You may wish to proceed as follows:\n(a) Calculate the heat exchanges QH and QC as a function of ΘH, ΘC, and the volume\nexpansion factors.\n(b) Calculate the volume expansion factor in an adiabatic process as a function of Θ.\n(c) Show that QH/QC = ΘH/ΘC.\n********\n4. Equations of State:\nThe equation of state constrains the form of internal energy as\nin the following examples.\n(a) Starting from dE = TdS -PdV , show that the equation of state PV = NkBT, in fact\nimplies that E can only depend on T.\n(b) What is the most general equation of state consistent with an internal energy that\ndepends only on temperature?\n(c) Show that for a van der Waals gas CV is a function of temperature alone.\n********\n5. Clausius-Clapeyron equation describes the variation of boiling point with pressure. It is\nusually derived from the condition that the chemical potentials of the gas and liquid phases\nare the same at coexistence. For an alternative derivation, consider a Carnot engine using\none mole of water. At the source (P, T) the latent heat L is supplied converting water\nto steam. There is a volume increase V associated with this process. The pressure is\nadiabatically decreased to P -dP. At the sink (P -dP, T -dT) steam is condensed back\nto water.\n(a) Show that the work output of the engine is W = V dP + O(dP 2). Hence obtain the\nClausius-Clapeyron equation\ndP\nL\n\n=\n.\n(1)\ndT\nTV\nboiling\n(b) What is wrong with the following argument: \"The heat QH supplied at the source to\nconvert one mole of water to steam is L(T). At the sink L(T -dT) is supplied to condense\none mole of steam to water. The difference dTdL/dT must equal the work W = V dP,\nequal to LdT/T from eq.(1). Hence dL/dT = L/T implying that L is proportional to T!\"\n(c) Assume that L is approximately temperature independent, and that the volume change\nis dominated by the volume of steam treated as an ideal gas, i.e. V = NkBT/P. Integrate\nequation (1) to obtain P(T).\n(d) A hurricane works somewhat like the engine described above. Water evaporates at the\nwarm surface of the ocean, steam rises up in the atmosphere, and condenses to water at\n\nthe higher and cooler altitudes. The Coriolis force converts the upwards suction of the\nair to spiral motion. (Using ice and boiling water, you can create a little storm in a tea\ncup.) Typical values of warm ocean surface and high altitude temperatures are 800F and\n-1200F respectively. The warm water surface layer must be at least 200 feet thick to\nprovide sufficient water vapor, as the hurricane needs to condense about 90 million tons\nof water vapor per hour to maintain itself. Estimate the maximum possible efficiency, and\npower output, of such a hurricane. (The latent heat of vaporization of water is about\n2.3 × 106Jkg-1.)\n(e) Due to gravity, atmospheric pressure P(h) drops with the height h.\nBy balancing\nthe forces acting on a slab of air (behaving like a perfect gas) of thickness dh, show that\nP(h) = P0 exp(-mgh/kT), where m is the average mass of a molecule in air.\n(f) Use the above results to estimate the boiling temperature of water on top of Mount\nEverest (h ≈9km). The latent heat of vaporization of water is about 2.3 × 106Jkg-1 .\n********\n6. Glass:\nLiquid quartz, if cooled slowly, crystallizes at a temperature Tm, and releases\nlatent heat L. Under more rapid cooling conditions, the liquid is supercooled and becomes\nglassy.\n(a) As both phases of quartz are almost incompressible, there is no work input, and changes\nin internal energy satisfy dE = TdS + μdN. Use the extensivity condition to obtain the\nexpression for μ in terms of E, T, S, and N.\n(b) The heat capacity of crystalline quartz is approximately CX = αT 3, while that of\nglassy quartz is roughly CG = βT, where α and β are constants.\nAssuming that the third law of thermodynamics applies to both crystalline and glass\nphases, calculate the entropies of the two phases at temperatures T ≤Tm.\n(c) At zero temperature the local bonding structure is similar in glass and crystalline\nquartz, so that they have approximately the same internal energy E0.\nCalculate the\ninternal energies of both phases at temperatures T ≤Tm.\n(d) Use the condition of thermal equilibrium between two phases to compute the equilib\nrium melting temperature Tm in terms of α and β.\n(e) Compute the latent heat L in terms of α and β.\n(f) Is the result in the previous part correct? If not, which of the steps leading to it is\nmost likely to be incorrect?\n********\n7. Characteristic functions:\nCalculate the characteristic function, the mean, and the\nvariance of the following probability density functions:\n(a) Uniform\np(x) =\nfor\n-a < x < a\n, and\np(x) = 0\notherwise;\n2a\n\nq\nZ\n(b) Laplace\np(x) = 2\na exp -|x\na\n|\n;\n(c) Cauchy\np(x) = π(x2a\n+a2)\n.\nThe following two probability density functions are defined for x ≥0. Compute only\nthe mean and variance for each.\n(d) Rayleigh\np(x) =\nx exp(-x )\n,\na2\n2a2\n(e) Maxwell\np(x) =\n2 x 2 exp(-x 2 )\n.\nπ a3\n2a2\n********\n8. Tchebycheff inequality:\nConsider any probability density p(x) for (-inf< x < inf),\nwith mean λ, and variance σ2 . Show that the total probability of outcomes that are more\nthan nσ away from λ is less than 1/n2, i.e.\ndxp(x) ≤\n.\n|x-λ|≥nσ\nn\nHint: Start with the integral defining σ2, and break it up into parts corresponding to\n|x -λ| > nσ, and |x -λ| < nσ.\n********\n9. Optimal selection:\nIn many specialized populations, there is little variability among\nthe members. Is this a natural consequence of optimal selection?\n(a) Let {rα} be n random numbers, each independently chosen from a probability density\np(r), with r ∈[0, 1]. Calculate the probability density pn(x) for the largest value of this\nset, i.e. for x = max{r1,\n, rn}.\n· · ·\n(b) If each rα is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, calculate the mean and variance\nof x as a function of n, and comment on their behavior at large n.\n********\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Calculate\nthe angle of contact, and find the condition for the appearance of a water film (complete\nwetting).\n- When steam condenses on a solid surface, water either forms a droplet, or spreads on\nthe surface. There are two ways to consider this problem:\nMethod 1: Energy associated with the interfaces\nIn equilibrium, the total energy associated with the three interfaces should be mini\nmum, and therefore\ndE = SawdAaw + SasdAas + SwsdAws = 0.\n\nSince the total surface area of the solid is constant,\ndAas + dAws = 0.\nFrom geometrical considerations (see proof below), we obtain\ndAws cos θ = dAaw.\nFrom these equations, we obtain\ndE = (Saw cos θ -Sas + Sws) dAws = 0,\n=\ncos θ = Sas -Sws .\n⇒\nSaw\nProof of dAws cos θ = dAaw: Consider a droplet which is part of a sphere of radius R,\nwhich is cut by the substrate at an angle θ. The areas of the involved surfaces are\nAws = π(R sin θ)2 ,\nand\nAaw = 2πR2(1 -cos θ).\nLet us consider a small change in shape, accompanied by changes in R and θ.\nThese\nvariations should preserve the volume of water, i.e. constrained by\nπR3\nV =\ncos 3 θ -3 cos θ + 2 .\nIntroducing x = cos θ, we can re-write the above results as\n\nAws = πR2\nx\n,\n\n1 -\n\nAaw = 2πR2 (1 -x) ,\n\nπR3\n\nV =\nx -3x + 2 .\nThe variations of these quantities are then obtained from\n\ndAws = 2πR\ndR (1 -x 2) -Rx dx,\n\ndx\n\ndR\ndAaw = 2πR 2\n(1 -x) -R dx,\n\ndx\n\ndR\n\ndV = πR2\ndx (x -3x + 2) + R(x -x) dx = 0.\nFrom the last equation, we conclude\n1 dR\nx2\nx\nx + 1\nR dx = -x -3\n-\nx + 2 = -(x -1)(x + 2) .\n\nSubstituting for dR/dx gives,\ndAws = 2πR2 dx\nx + 2,\nand\ndAaw = 2πR2 x · dx\nx + 2 ,\nresulting in the required result of\ndAaw = x dAws = dAws cos θ.\n·\nMethod 2: Balancing forces on the contact line\nAnother way to interpret the result is to consider the force balance of the equilibrium\nsurface tension on the contact line. There are four forces acting on the line: (1) the surface\ntension at the water-gas interface, (2) the surface tension at the solid-water interface, (3)\nthe surface tension at the gas-solid interface, and (4) the force downward by solid-contact\nline interaction. The last force ensures that the contact line stays on the solid surface, and\nis downward since the contact line is allowed to move only horizontally without friction.\nThese forces should cancel along both the y-direction x-directions. The latter gives the\ncondition for the contact angle known as Young's equation,\nSas = Saw cos θ + Sws ,\n=\ncos θ = Sas -Sws .\n·\n⇒\nSaw\nThe critical condition for the complete wetting occurs when θ = 0, or cos θ = 1, i.e. for\ncos θC = Sas -Sws = 1.\nSaw\nComplete wetting of the substrate thus occurs whenever\nSaw ≤Sas -Sws.\n(c) In the realm of \"large\" bodies gravity is the dominant force, while at \"small\" distances\nsurface tension effects are all important.\nAt room temperature, the surface tension of\nwater is So ≈7×10-2Nm-1 . Estimate the typical length-scale that separates \"large\" and\n\"small\" behaviors. Give a couple of examples for where this length-scale is important.\n- Typical length scales at which the surface tension effects become significant are given\nby the condition that the forces exerted by surface tension and relevant pressures become\ncomparable, or by the condition that the surface energy is comparable to the other energy\nchanges of interest.\nExample 1: Size of water drops not much deformed on a non-wetting surface. This is given\nby equalizing the surface energy and the gravitational energy,\nS 4πR2 ≈mgR = ρV gR = 4π R4 g,\n·\n\ns\ns\nleading to\nR ≈\n3S\n3 · 7 × 10-2N/m\n× 10-3 m = 1.5mm.\nρg ≈\n103kg/m3 × 10m/s2 ≈1.5\nExample 2: Swelling of spherical gels in a saturated vapor: Osmotic pressure of the gel\n(about 1 atm) = surface tension of water, gives\nN\n2S\nπgel ≈\nkBT ≈\n,\nV\nR\nwhere N is the number of counter ions within the gel. Thus,\nR ≈\n2 × 7 × 10-2N/m\n≈10-6 m.\n105N/m2\n********\n2. Surfactants:\nSurfactant molecules such as those in soap or shampoo prefer to spread\non the air-water surface rather than dissolve in water. To see this, float a hair on the\nsurface of water and gently touch the water in its vicinity with a piece of soap. (This is\nalso why a piece of soap can power a toy paper boat.)\n(a) The air-water surface tension So (assumed to be temperature independent) is reduced\nroughly by NkBT/A, where N is the number of surfactant particles, and A is the area.\nExplain this result qualitatively.\n- Typical surfactant molecules have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, and prefer\nto go to the interface between water and air, or water and oil. Some examples are,\nCH3 -(CH2)11 -SO-Na+ ,\n3 ·\nCH3 -(CH2)11 -N +(CH3)3 Cl-,\n·\nCH3 -(CH2)11 -O -(CH2 -CH2 -O)12 -H.\nThe surfactant molecules spread over the surface of water and behave as a two dimensional\ngas. The gas has a pressure proportional to the density and the absolute temperature,\nwhich comes from the two dimensional degrees of freedom of the molecules. Thus the\nsurfactants lower the free energy of the surface when the surface area is increased.\nN\nN\nΔFsurfactant = A kBT · ΔA = (S -So) · ΔA,\n= ⇒\nS = So -A kBT.\n(Note that surface tension is defined with a sign opposite to that of hydrostatic pressure.)\n\n(b) Place a drop of water on a clean surface. Observe what happens to the air-water\nsurface contact angle as you gently touch the droplet surface with a small piece of soap,\nand explain the observation.\n- As shown in the previous problem, the contact angle satisfies\nSas -Sws\ncos θ =\n.\nSaw\nTouching the surface of the droplet with a small piece of soap reduces Saw, hence cos θ\nincreases, or equivalently, the angle θ decreases.\n(c) More careful observations show that at higher surfactant densities\n\n∂S\nNkBT\n2a\nN\n∂T\nA -Nb\n∂A\nT\n= (A -Nb)2 -A\nA\n,\nand\n∂S A\n= - NkB\n;\nwhere a and b are constants. Obtain the expression for S(A, T) and explain qualitatively\nthe origin of the corrections described by a and b.\n- When the surfactant molecules are dense their interaction becomes important, resulting\nin\n\n∂S =\nNkBT\n2a\nN\n,\n∂A\n(A -Nb)2 -A\nA\nT\nand\n\n∂T\n=\nA -Nb .\n∂S A\n- NkB\nIntegrating the first equation, gives\n\nNkBT\nN\nS(A, t) = f(T) -A -Nb + a\nA\n,\nwhere f(T) is a function of only T, while integrating the second equation, yields\nNkBT\nS(A, T) = g(A) -A -Nb,\nwith g(A) a function of only A. By comparing these two equations we get\n\nNkBT\nN\nS(A, T) = So -A -Nb + a\nA\n,\nwhere So represents the surface tension in the absence of surfactants and is independent\nof A and T. The equation resembles the van der Waals equation of state for gas-liquid\nsystems. The factor Nb in the second term represents the excluded volume effect due to\nthe finite size of the surfactant molecules. The last term represents the binary interaction\n\nbetween two surfactant molecules. If surfactant molecules attract each other the coefficient\na is positive the surface tension increases.\n(d)\n\nFind an expression for CS -CA in terms of\n∂E\n∂A\nT , S,\n∂\n∂A S\nT , and\n∂\n∂T\nS\n\nA , for\n∂E\n∂T\nA =\n∂E\n∂T\n.\nS\n- Taking A and T as independent variables, we obtain\n∂E\n∂E\nδQ = dE -S · dA,\n= ⇒\nδQ = ∂A\nT\ndA + ∂T\nA\ndT -S · dA,\nand\n\n∂E\n∂E\nδQ =\n∂A T\n-S\ndA + ∂T\n\nA\ndT.\nFrom the above result, the heat capacities are obtained as\n\nδQ\n∂E\n\n=\n\nCA ≡ δT\n∂T\nA\nA\n\n,\n\nδQ\n∂E\n∂A\n∂E\n\nC\n=\n+\nS ≡ δT\n∂A\nT\n-S\n∂T\n∂T\nS\nS\nS\nresulting in\n∂E\n∂A\nC\n=\n.\nS -CA\n∂A\nT\n-S\n∂T\nS\nUsing the chain rule relation\n∂T\n\n∂A\n\n∂S\n=\n∂S\nA\n· ∂A\nT\n· ∂T\nS\n-1,\nwe obtain\n\n∂E\nC\n=\n\n.\nS -CA\n∂A\nT\n-S\n·\n∂T\n-1\n∂S\n∂S\nA · ∂A T\n********\n3. Temperature scales:\nProve the equivalence of the ideal gas temperature scale Θ, and\nthe thermodynamic scale T, by performing a Carnot cycle on an ideal gas. The ideal gas\nsatisfies PV = NkBΘ, and its internal energy E is a function of Θ only. However, you\nmay not assume that E ∝Θ. You may wish to proceed as follows:\n(a) Calculate the heat exchanges QH and QC as a function of ΘH, ΘC, and the volume\nexpansion factors.\n- The ideal gas temperature is defined through the equation of state\nPV\nθ =\n.\nNkB\n\nThe thermodynamic temperature is defined for a reversible Carnot cycle by\nThot\nQhot\n=\n.\nTcold\nQcold\nFor an ideal gas, the internal energy is a function only of θ, i.e. E = E(θ), and\ndE\ndQ = dE -dW =\ndθ + PdV.\n\ndθ ·\nadiabatics (ΔQ = 0)\npressure P\nQhot\nQcold\nθ\nθ\nisothermals\ncold\nhot\nvolume V\nConsider the Carnot cycle indicated in the figure.

In the P -V diagram shown, the state at \"1\" corresponds to pure water, \"2\"\ncorresponds to pure vapor, but the states \"3\" and \"4\" have two phases coexisting.

Water evaporates at the\nwarm surface of the ocean, steam rises up in the atmosphere, and condenses to water at\nthe higher and cooler altitudes. The Coriolis force converts the upwards suction of the\nair to spiral motion. (Using ice and boiling water, you can create a little storm in a tea\ncup.) Typical values of warm ocean surface and high altitude temperatures are 800F and\n-1200F respectively. The warm water surface layer must be at least 200 feet thick to\nprovide sufficient water vapor, as the hurricane needs to condense about 90 million tons\nof water vapor per hour to maintain itself.

There will be a recitation with test review on Monday 10/22/07.\nThe test is 'closed book,' and composed entirely from a subset of the following prob\nlems.\nThus if you are familiar and comfortable with these problems, there will be no\nsurprises!\n********\nYou may find the following information helpful:\nPhysical Constants\nElectron mass\nme ≈9.1 × 10-31kg\nProton mass\nmp ≈1.7 × 10-27kg\nElectron Charge\ne ≈1.6 × 10-19C\nPlanck's const./2π h ≈1.1 × 10-34Js-1\nSpeed of light\nc ≈3.0 × 108ms-1\nStefan's const.\nσ ≈5.7 × 10-8Wm-2K-4\nBoltzmann's const. kB ≈1.4 × 10-23JK-1 Avogadro's number N0 ≈6.0 × 1023mol-1\nConversion Factors\nA ≡10-10\n1atm ≡1.0 × 105Nm-2\nm\n1eV ≡1.1 × 104K\nThermodynamics\ndE =\ndW\nFor a gas:\n= -PdV\nFor a wire: dW = Jdx\nTdS+\ndW\n\nMathematical Formulas\nR\ne-αx\nn!\n√π\ninfdx xn\n= αn+1\n2 ! =\nR\nx 2\nσ2k2\ninf dx exp -ikx -\n=\n√\n2πσ2 exp\nlimN→infln N! = N ln N -N\n2σ2\n-inf\n-\n\ne-ikx\n= Pinf\nn=0\n(-\nn\nik\n!\n)n hxni\nln\n\ne-ikx\n= Pinf\nn=1\n(-\nn\nik\n!\n)n hxnic\ncosh(x) = 1 + x\n2! + x\n4! +\nsinh(x) = x + x\n3! + x\n5! +\n· · ·\n· · ·\n2πd/2\nSurface area of a unit sphere in d dimensions\nSd = (d/2-1)!\n\nZ\n1. One dimensional gas:\nA thermalized gas particle is suddenly confined to a one-\ndimensional trap. The corresponding mixed state is described by an initial density function\nρ(q, p, t = 0) = δ(q)f(p), where f(p) = exp(-p2/2mkBT)/√2πmkBT.\n(a) Starting from Liouville's equation, derive ρ(q, p, t) and sketch it in the (q, p) plane.\n- Liouville's equation, describing the incompressible nature of phase space density, is\n∂ρ = -q ∂ρ\np ∂ρ =\n∂H ∂ρ + ∂H ∂ρ\n∂t\n∂q -\n∂p\n-∂p ∂q\n∂q ∂p ≡-{ρ, H}.\nFor the gas particle confined to a 1-dimensional trap, the Hamiltonian can be written as\np\np\nH = 2m + V (qx) = 2m,\nsince Vqx = 0, and there is no motion in the y and z directions. With this Hamiltonian,\nLiouville's equation becomes\n∂ρ\np ∂ρ\n∂t = -m ∂q ,\nwhose solution, subject to the specified initial conditions, is\np\np\nρ(q, p, t) = ρ\nt, p, 0\n= δ\nt f(p).\nq -m\nq -m\np\nq\nt=0\nslope m/ t\n(b) Derive the expressions for the averages\nq2\nand\np2\nat t > 0.\n- The expectation value for any observable O is\nhOi =\ndΓOρ(Γ, t),\n\nZ\nZ\n\nr\nand hence\n\np\np 2\n=\np 2f(p)δ q -mt dp dq =\np 2f(p)dp\n=\nZ inf\ndp p2\nexp\np2\n= mkBT.\n√2πmkBT\n-2mkBT\n-inf\nLikewise, we obtain\nq 2\n=\nZ\nq 2f(p)δ\n\nq -m\np t\n\ndp dq =\nZ\nm\np t\nf(p)dp =\n\nm\nt 2 Z\np 2f(p)dp = kB\nm\nT t2 .\n(c) Suppose that hard walls are placed at q = ±Q. Describe ρ(q, p, t ≫τ), where τ is an\nappropriately large relaxation time.\n- Now suppose that hard walls are placed at q = ±Q. The appropriate relaxation time\nτ, is the characteristic length between the containing walls divided by the characteristic\nvelocity of the particle, i.e.\n2Q\n2Qm\nm\nτ ∼ q\n= p\n= 2Q\nkBT .\n| |\nhp2i\nInitially ρ(q, p, t) resembles the distribution shown in part (a), but each time the particle\nhits the barrier, reflection changes p to -p. As time goes on, the slopes become less, and\nρ(q, p, t) becomes a set of closely spaced lines whose separation vanishes as 2mQ/t.\np\nq\n+Q\n-Q\n(d) A \"coarse-grained\" density ρ, is obtained by ignoring variations of ρ below some small\nresolution in the (q, p) plane; e.g., by averaging ρ over cells of the resolution area. Find\nρ (q, p) for the situation in part (c), and show that it is stationary.\n\nR\n-\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\nR\nR\nY\n- We can choose any resolution ε in (p, q) space, subdividing the plane into an array of\npixels of this area. For any ε, after sufficiently long time many lines will pass through this\narea. Averaging over them leads to\nρ (q, p, t ≫τ) = 2Qf(p),\nas (i) the density f(p) at each p is always the same, and (ii) all points along q ∈[-Q, +Q]\nare equally likely. For the time variation of this coarse-grained density, we find\n∂ρ\np ∂ρ\n∂t = -m ∂q = 0,\ni.e. ρ is stationary.\n********\n2. Evolution of entropy:\nThe normalized ensemble density is a probability in the phase\nspace Γ. This probability has an associated entropy S(t) =\ndΓρ(Γ, t) lnρ(Γ, t).\n-\n(a) Show that if ρ(Γ, t) satisfies Liouville's equation for a Hamiltonian H, dS/dt = 0.\nA candidate \"entropy\" is defined by\nS(t) =\ndΓρ(Γ, t) lnρ(Γ, t) =\n.\n-\n-hln ρ(Γ, t)i\nTaking the derivative with respect to time gives\ndS\n∂ρ\n1 ∂ρ\n∂ρ\n=\ndΓ\nln ρ + ρ\n=\ndΓ\n(ln ρ + 1) .\ndt\n-\n∂t\nρ ∂t\n-\n∂t\nSubstituting the expression for ∂ρ/∂t obtained from Liouville's theorem gives\nZ\n3N\n\ndS\nX\n∂ρ ∂H\n∂ρ ∂H\ndt = -\ndΓ\n∂pi ∂qi\n-∂qi ∂pi\n(ln ρ + 1) .\ni=1\n(Here the index i is used to label the 3 coordinates, as well as the N particles, and hence\nruns from 1 to 3N.) Integrating the above expression by parts yields+\n+ This is standard integration by parts, i.e.\nb\na FdG = FG|b\na -\nb\na GdF.\nLooking\nexplicitly at one term in the expression to be integrated in this problem,\nZ 3N\nZ\ndVi\n∂ρ ∂H =\ndq1dp1\ndqidpi\ndq3Ndp3N\n∂ρ ∂H,\n∂qi ∂pi\n· · ·\n· · ·\n∂qi ∂pi\ni=1\n∂ρ\nwe identify dG = dqi ∂qi , and F with the remainder of the expression.\nNoting that\nρ(qi) = 0 at the boundaries of the box, we get\nZ 3N\nZ 3N\nY\ndVi\n∂ρ ∂H =\nY\ndViρ ∂∂H.\n∂qi ∂pi\n-\n∂qi ∂pi\ni=1\ni=1\n\nX\nR\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\nZ\n3N\n\ndS\n∂\n∂\ndt =\ndΓ\nρ∂pi\n∂\n∂q\nH\ni\n(ln ρ + 1)\n-ρ∂qi\n∂\n∂p\nH\ni\n(ln ρ + 1)\ni=1\nZ\n3N\n\n=\ndΓ\nX\nρ ∂2H (ln ρ + 1) + ρ∂H 1 ∂ρ\n∂2H (ln ρ + 1) -ρ∂H 1 ∂ρ\n∂pi∂qi\n∂qi ρ ∂pi\n-ρ∂qi∂pi\n∂pi ρ ∂qi\ni=1\nZ\n3N\n\nX ∂H ∂ρ\n∂H ∂ρ\n=\ndΓ\n.\n∂qi ∂pi\n-∂pi ∂qi\ni=1\nIntegrating the final expression by parts gives\nZ\n3N\n\ndS\nX\n∂2\n∂2\n=\ndΓ\n-ρ\nH\n+ ρ\nH\n= 0.\ndt\n-\n∂pi∂qi\n∂qi∂pi\ni=1\n(b) Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, find the function ρmax(Γ) which maximizes\nthe functional S[ρ], subject to the constraint of fixed average energy, hHi =\ndΓρH = E.\n- There are two constraints, normalization and constant average energy, written respec\ntively as\ndΓρ(Γ) = 1,\nand\nhHi =\ndΓρ(Γ)H = E.\nRewriting the expression for entropy,\nS(t) =\ndΓρ(Γ) [-ln ρ(Γ) -α -βH] + α + βE,\nwhere α and β are Lagrange multipliers used to enforce the two constraints. Extremizing\nthe above expression with respect to the function ρ(Γ), results in\n∂S\n\n∂ρ(Γ)\n= -ln ρmax(Γ) -α -βH(Γ) -1 = 0.\nρ=ρmax\nThe solution to this equation is\nln ρmax = -(α + 1) -βH,\nwhich can be rewritten as\nρmax = C exp (-βH) ,\nwhere\nC = e-(α+1).\n\nn\no\n\"\n\n!\n#\nX\nX\nX\n(c) Show that the solution to part (b) is stationary, i.e. ∂ρmax/∂t = 0.\n- The density obtained in part (b) is stationary, as can be easily checked from\n∂ρmax\n∂t\n= -{ρmax, H} = -\nCe-βH, H\n= ∂HC(-β) ∂He-βH - ∂HC(-β) ∂He-βH = 0.\n∂p\n∂q\n∂q\n∂p\n(d) How can one reconcile the result in (a), with the observed increase in entropy as\nthe system approaches the equilibrium density in (b)?\n(Hint: Think of the situation\nencountered in the previous problem.)\n- Liouville's equation preserves the information content of the PDF ρ(Γ, t), and hence S(t)\ndoes not increase in time. However, as illustrated in the example in problem 1, the density\nbecomes more finely dispersed in phase space. In the presence of any coarse-graining of\nphase space, information disappears. The maximum entropy, corresponding to ρ, describes\nequilibrium in this sense.\n********\n3. The Vlasov equation is obtained in the limit of high particle density n = N/V , or large\ninter-particle interaction range λ, such that nλ3 ≫1.

The Boltzmann equation is obtained in the dilute limit, nλ3 ≪1, by disregarding\nterms of order 1/τX ≪1/τc.

This implies that the densities of up and down spins can be different in the\nfinal equilibrium, while the two systems must share the same velocity and temperature.\n(e) Show that the streaming terms in the Boltzmann equation are zero for any function\nthat depends only on the quantities conserved by the one body Hamiltonians.\n- The Boltzmann equation is\n∂fα = -{fα, Hα} + Cαα + Cαβ,\n∂t\nwhere the right hand side consists of streaming terms {fα, Hα}, and collision terms C.\nLet Ii denote any quantity conserved by the one body Hamiltonian, i.e. {Ii , Hα} = 0.\nConsider fα which is a function only of the Ii\n′s\nfα ≡fα (I1, I2,\n) .\n· · ·\nThen\nX ∂fα\n{fα, Hα} =\n∂Ij\n{Ij , Hα} = 0.\nj\n(f) Show that angular momentum L~ = ~q×p~, is conserved during, and away from collisions.\n- Conservation of momentum for a collision at ~q\n(p~1 + p~2) = (p~1\n′ + p~2\n′),\nimplies\n~ × (~\np2)\n~ × (~\np2\n′),\nq\np1 + ~\n= q\np1\n′ + ~\nor\nL~ 1 + L~ 2 = L~ 1\n′ + L~ 2\n′ ,\nwhere we have used L~ i = ~q × p~i. Hence angular momentum L~ is conserved during colli\nsions. Note that only the z-component Lz is present for electrons moving in 2-dimensions,\nq ≡(x1, x2), as is the case for the electron gas studied in this problem.

Based on the results of the previous\nparts, we thus obtain\nfα = Aα exp [-βHα -γLz] .\nThe collision terms allow for the possibility of a term -~u p~ in the exponent, corresponding\n·\nto an average velocity.\nSuch a term will not commute with the potential set up by a\nstationary box, and is thus ruled out by the streaming terms. On the other hand, the\nangular momentum does commute with a circular potential {V (~q), L} = 0, and is allowed\nby the streaming terms. A non-zero γ describes the electron gas rotating in a circular\nbox.\n(h) How is the result in part (g) modified by including scattering from magnetic and\nnon-magnetic impurities?\nScattering from any impurity removes the conservation of p~, and hence L~, in collisions.\n-\nThe γ term will no longer be needed. Scattering from magnetic impurities mixes popula\ntions of up and down spins, necessitating A = A ; non-magnetic impurities do not have\n↑\n↓\nthis effect.\n(i) Do conservation of spin and angular momentum lead to new hydrodynamic equations?\n- Conservation of angular momentum is related to conservation of p~, as shown in (f), and\nhence does not lead to any new equation.

The Hamiltonian\nis\n2N\n2N\nX p~i\nX\nH =\n2m -\ncicj ln |~qi -q~j|\n,\ni=1\ni<j\nwhere ci = +c0 for i = 1,\nN, and ci = -c0 for i = N + 1,\n2N, denote the charges of\n· · ·\n· · ·\nthe particles; {~qi} and {~pi} their coordinates and momenta respectively.\n(a) Note that in the interaction term each pair appears only once, and that there is no\nself interaction i = j. How many pairs have repulsive interactions, and how many have\nattractive interactions?\n(b) Write down the expression for the partition function Z(N, T, A) in terms of integrals\nover {~qi} and {~pi}. Perform the integrals over the momenta, and rewrite the contribution\nof the coordinates as a product involving powers of {~qi}, using the identity eln x = x.\n(c) Although it is not possible to perform the integrals over {~qi} exactly, the dependence\nof Z on A can be obtained by the simple rescaling of coordinates, ~qi ′ = ~qi/L.

Exact solutions for a one dimensional gas:\nIn statistical mechanics, there are very\nfew systems of interacting particles that can be solved exactly. Such exact solutions are\nvery important as they provide a check for the reliability of various approximations. A\none dimensional gas with short-range interactions is one such solvable case.\n(a) Show that for a potential with a hard core that screens the interactions from further\nneighbors, the Hamiltonian for N particles can be written as\nN\nN\nX p\nX\ni\nH =\n2m +\nV(xi -xi-1).\ni=1\ni=2\nThe (indistinguishable) particles are labelled with coordinates {xi} such that\n0 ≤x1 ≤x2 ≤· · · ≤ xN ≤L,\nwhere L is the length of the box confining the particles.\n(b) Write the expression for the partition function Z(T, N, L). Change variables to δ1 =\nx1, δ2 = x2 -x1,\n, δN = xN -xN-1, and carefully indicate the allowed ranges of\n· · ·\nintegration and the constraints.\n(c) Consider the Gibbs partition function obtained from the Laplace transformation\ninf\nZ(T, N, P) =\ndL exp(-βPL)Z(T, N, L),\nand by extremizing the integrand find the standard formula for P in the canonical ensem\nble.\nPN\n(d) Change variables from L to δN+1 = L-\ni=1 δi, and find the expression for Z(T, N, P)\nas a product over one-dimensional integrals over each δi.\n(e) At a fixed pressure P, find expressions for the mean length L(T, N, P), and the density\nn = N/L(T, N, P) (involving ratios of integrals which should be easy to interpret).\nSince the expression for n(T, P) in part (e) is continuous and non-singular for any\nchoice of potential, there is in fact no condensation transition for the one-dimensional\ngas. By contrast, the approximate van der Waals equation (or the mean-field treatment)\nincorrectly predicts such a transition.\n(f) For a hard sphere gas, with minimum separation a between particles, calculate the\nequation of state P(T, n). Compare the excluded volume factor with the approximate\nresult obtained in earlier problems, and also obtain the general virial coefficient Bl(T).\n********\n6.

The first and last particles are held\n\n\"\n#\nD\nE\n\nfixed at the equilibrium separation of Na. Let us denote the longitudinal displacements\nof the particles from their equilibrium positions by {ui}, with u0 = uN = 0 since the end\nparticles are fixed. The Hamiltonian governing {ui}, and the conjugate momenta {pi}, is\nN-1\nN-2\n=\nX p2\ni + K\nu 2\n1 +\nX\n(ui+1 -ui)2 + u 2\n.\nH\n2m\nN-1\ni=1\ni=1\n(a) Using the appropriate (sine) Fourier transforms, find the normal modes {u k}, and the\ncorresponding frequencies {ωk}.\n(b) Express the Hamiltonian in terms of the amplitudes of normal modes {u k}, and evaluate\nthe classical partition function. (You may integrate the {ui} from -infto +inf).\n(c) First evaluate\n|u k| 2 , and use the result to calculate u2 . Plot the resulting squared\ni\ndisplacement of each particle as a function of its equilibrium position.\n(d) How are the results modified if only the first particle is fixed (u0 = 0), while the other\nend is free (uN = 0)? (Note that this is a much simpler problem as the partition function\ncan be evaluated by changing variables to the N -1 spring extensions.)\n********\n7.

(Relativistic calculations do not modify this result which\nwas originally obtained by Laplace.)\n(b) Does entropy increase or decrease when two black holes collapse into one? What is the\nentropy change for the universe (in equivalent number of bits of information), when two\nsolar mass black holes (M⊙ ≈2 × 1030kg) coalesce?\n(c) The internal energy of the black hole is given by the Einstein relation, E = Mc2 .

The\npartition function for two particles (i.e. N = 1) is now given by\n-βc\nZ(N = 1, T, A) = λ\nd2q 1d2q 2 · |q 1 -q2|\n0.\nTo evaluate this integral, first change to center of mass and relative coordinates\n\nQ=1(q 1 + q2),\n=q 1 -q 2.\nq\nIntegrating over the center of mass gives\nZ\nZ L\nA\n2πA\nd2q q-βc2\n· q 1-βc2\nZ(N = 1, T, A) =\n≈\nλ4\ndq\nλ4\na\nL\nq 2-βc2\nL2-βc\n2-βc\n2πA\n\n2πA\n- a\n=\n=\n.\n2 -βc2\nλ4\n\nλ4\n2 -βc2\na\n\nIf 2 -βc2\n0 < 0, as L →inf,\n2πA a2-βc2\n,\nZ ≈\nλ4 2 -βc2\nis controlled by the short distance cutoff a; while if 2-βc2\n0 > 0, the integral is controlled by\nthe system size L, as assumed in part (c). Hence the critical temperature can be estimated\nby βc2\n0 = 2, giving\nc0\nTc =\n,\n2kB\nwhich is larger than Tc\n0 by a factor of 2. Thus the unphysical collapse at low temperatures\nis preempted at the higher temperature where the hard cores become important. The high\ntemperature phase (T > Tc) is a dissociated plasma; while the low temperature phase is a\ngas of paired dipoles.\n********\n5.

One dimensional chain: A chain of N +1 particles of mass m is connected by N massless\nsprings of spring constant K and relaxed length a.

In a normal mode, the particles oscillate\n· · ·\nin phase. The usual procedure is to obtain the modes, and corresponding frequencies,\nby diagonalizing the matrix of coefficeints coupling the displacements on the right hand\nside of the equation of motion. For any linear system, we have md2ui/dt2 = Kijuj, and\nwe must diagonalize Kij. In the above example, Kij is only a function of the difference\ni -j. This is a consequence of translational symmetry, and allows us to diagonalize the\nmatrix using Fourier modes. Due to the boundary conditions in this case, the appropriate\ntransformation involves the sine, and the motion of the j-th particle in a normal mode is\ngiven by\nu k(n)(j) =\n2 e±iωnt sin (k(n) j) .\nN\n·\nThe origin of time is arbitrary, but to ensure that uN = 0, we must set\nnπ\nk(n) ≡\n,\nfor\nn = 1, 2,\n, N -1.\nN\n· · ·\nLarger values of n give wave-vectors that are simply shifted by a multiple of π, and hence\ncoincide with one of the above normal modes.

According to the recently formulated\nHolographic Principle there is a maximum to the amount of entropy that this volume of\nspace can have, independent of its contents! What is this maximal entropy?\n- The mass inside the spherical volume of radius R must be less than the mass that would\nmake a black hole that fills this volume. Bring in additional mass (from infinity) inside\nthe volume, so as to make a volume-filling balck hole. Clearly the entropy of the system\n\nX\n\nwill increase in the process, and the final entropy, which is the entropy of the black hole is\nlarger than the initial entropy in the volume, leading to the inequality\nkBc3\nS ≤SBH =\nA,\n4G h\nwhere A = 4πR2 is the area enclosing the volume. The surprising observation is that the\nupper bound on the entropy is proportional to area, whereas for any system of particles\nwe expect the entropy to be proportional to N. This should remain valid even at very\nhigh temperatures when interactions are unimportant. The 'holographic principle' is an\nallusion to the observation that it appears as if the degrees of freedom are living on the\nsurface of the system, rather than its volume. It was formulated in the context of string\ntheory which attempts to construct a consistent theory of quantum gravity, which replaces\nparticles as degrees of freedom, with strings.\n********\n8.

      "content": "I. Thermodynamics\nI.A Fundamental definitions\n- Thermodynamics is a phenomenological description of equilibrium properties of macro\nscopic systems.\n⋆ As a phenomenological description, it is based on a number of empirical observations\nwhich are summarized by the laws of thermodynamics. A coherent logical and mathe\nmatical structure is then constructed on the basis of these observations, which leads to\na variety of useful concepts, and to testable relationships among various quantities. The\nlaws of thermodynamics can only be justified by a more fundamental (microscopic) theory\nof nature. For example, statistical mechanics attempts to obtain these laws starting from\nclassical or quantum mechanical equations for the evolution of collections of particles.\n⋆\nA system under study is said to be in equilibrium when its properties do not change\nappreciably with time over the intervals of interest (observation times). The dependence\non the observation time makes the concept of equilibrium subjective. For example, window\nglass is in equilibrium as a solid over many decades, but flows like a fluid over time scales\nof millennia. At the other extreme, it is perfectly legitimate to consider the equilibrium\nbetween matter and radiation in the early universe during the first minutes of the big bang.\n⋆ The macroscopic system in equilibrium is characterized by a number of thermodynamic\ncoordinates or state functions. Some common examples of such coordinates are pressure\nand volume (for a fluid), surface tension and area (for a film), tension and length (for\na wire), electric field and polarization (for a dielectric), · · ·. A closed system is an ide\nalization similar to a point particle in mechanics in that it is assumed to be completely\nisolated by adiabatic walls that don't allow any exchange of heat with the surroundings.\nBy contrast, diathermic walls allow heat exchange for an open system. In addition to the\nabove mechanical coordinates, the laws of thermodynamics imply the existence of other\nequilibrium state functions as described in the following sections.\n\nI.B The zeroth law\nThe zeroth law of thermodynamics describes the transitive nature of thermal equilib\nrium. It states:\n- If two systems, A and B, are separately in equilibrium with a third system C, then they\nare also in equilibrium with one another.\nDespite its apparent simplicity, the zeroth law has the consequence of implying the\nexistence of an important state function, the empirical temperature Θ, such that systems\nin equilibrium are at the same temperature.\nProof: Let the equilibrium state of systems A, B, and C be described by the coordinates\n{A1, A2, · · ·}, {B1, B2, · · ·}, and {C1, C2, · · ·} respectively. The assumption that A and C\nare in equilibrium implies a constraint between the coordinates of A and C, i.e. a change in\nA1 must be accompanied by some changes in {A2, · · · ; C1, C2, · · ·} to maintain equilibrium\nof A and C. Denote this constraint by\nfAC(A1, A2, · · · ; C1, C2, · · ·) = 0.\n(I.1)\nThe equilibrium of B and C implies a similar constraint\nfBC(B1, B2, · · · ; C1, C2, · · ·) = 0.\n(I.2)\nEach of the above equations can be solved for C1 to yield\nC1 =FAC(A1, A2, · · · ; C2, · · ·),\n(I.3)\nC1 =FBC(B1, B2, · · · ; C2, · · ·).\nThus if C is separately in equilibrium with A and B we must have\nFAC(A1, A2, · · · ; C2, · · ·) = FBC(B1, B2, · · · ; C2, · · ·).\n(I.4)\nHowever, according to the zeroth law there is also equilibrium between A and B, implying\nthe constraint\nfAB(A1, A2, · · · ; B1, B2, · · ·) = 0.\n(I.5)\nTherefore it must be possible to simplify eq.(I.4) by cancelling the coordinates of C. Hence,\nthe condition (I.5) for equilibrium of A and B must be expressible as\nΘA(A1, A2, · · ·) = ΘB(B1, B2, · · ·),\n(I.6)\n\ni.e., equilibrium is characterized by a function Θ of thermodynamic coordinates.\nThis\nfunction specifies the equation of state, and isotherms of A are described by the condition\nΘA(A1, A2, · · ·) = Θ.\nExample: Consider three systems: (A) a wire of length L with tension F, (B) a param\nagnet of magnetization M in a magnetic field B, and (C) a gas of volume V at pressure P.\nObservations indicate that when these systems are in equilibrium, the following constraints\nare satisfied between their coordinates:\na\nP +\n(V -b)(L -L0) -c[F -K(L -L0)] = 0,\nV 2\n\na\n(I.7)\nP +\n(V -b)M -dB = 0.\nV 2\nClearly these constraints can be organized into three empirical temperature functions as\n\na\nF\nB\nΘ ∝\nP +\n(V -b) = c\n-K\n= d\n.\n(I.8)\nV 2\nL -L0\nM\nThese are the well known equations of state describing:\nP\n\n+ a/V 2)(V -b = NkBT\n(van der Waals gas)\n\nM = (Nμ2\nBB)/(3kBT)\n(Curie paramagnet)\n.\n(I.9)\n\nF = (K + DT)(L -L0)\n(Hook ′ s law for rubber)\nThe ideal gas temperature scale: As the above example indicates, the zeroth law\nmerely states the presence of isotherms. In order to set up a practical temperature scale\nat this stage, a reference system is necessary. The ideal gas occupies an important place\nin thermodynamics and provides the necessary reference. Empirical observations indicate\nthat the product of pressure and volume is constant along the isotherms of any gas that is\nsufficiently dilute. The ideal gas refers to this dilute limit of real gases, and the ideal gas\ntemperature is proportional to the product. The constant of proportionality is determined\nby reference to the temperature of the triple point of the ice-water-gas system, which\nwas set to 273.16 degrees Kelvin (0K) by the 10th General Conference on Weights and\nMeasures in 1954. Using a dilute gas (i.e. as P → 0) as thermometer, the temperature of\na system can be obtained from\nT(oK) ≡ 273.16 ×\nlim (PV )system/ lim (PV )ice-water-gas .\n(I.10)\nP →0\nP →0\n\nP\nI.C The First law\nWe now consider transformations between different equilibrium states. Such transfor\nmations can be achieved by applying work or heat to the system. The first law states that\nboth work and heat are forms of energy, and that the total energy is conserved. We shall\nuse the following formulation:\n- The amount of work required to change the state of an otherwise adiabatically isolated\nsystem depends only on the initial and final states, and not on the means by which the\nwork is performed, or on the intermediate stages through which the system passes.\nAs a consequence, we conclude the existence of another state function, the internal\nenergy, E(X). Up to a constant, E(X) can be obtained from the amount of work ΔW\nneeded for an adiabatic transformation from an initial state Xi to a final state Xf , using\nΔW = E(Xf ) -E(Xi).\n(I.11)\nIn a generic (non-adiabatic) transformation, the amount of work does not equal to the\nchange in the internal energy. The difference ΔQ = ΔE - ΔW is defined as the heat\nintake of the system from its surroundings.\nClearly in such transformations, ΔQ and\nΔW are not separately functions of state, in that they depend on external factors such\nas the means of applying work, and not only on the final states. To emphasize this, for a\ndifferential transformation we write\n\n=\n\n(I.12)\ndQ\ndE -dW,\nwhere dE =\ndQ and\n∂iEdXi can be obtained by differentiation, while\ndW generally\ni\ncan not. Also note the convention that the signs of work and heat are chosen to indicate\nthe energy added to the system, and not vice versa.\nA quasi-static transformation is one that is performed sufficiently slowly so that the\nsystem is always in equilibrium. Thus at any stage of the process, the thermodynamic\ncoordinates of the system exist and can in principle be computed. For such transformations,\nthe work done on the system (equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work done\nby the system) can be related to changes in these coordinates. Typically one can divide\nthe state functions {X} into a set of generalized displacements {x}, and their conjugate\ngeneralized forces {J}, such that for an infinitesimal quasi-static transformation\nX\ndW =\nJidxi.\n(I.13)\ni\n\nTable [1] provides some common examples of such coordinates. Note that the displacement\nis usually an extensive quantity, i.e.\nproportional to system size, while the forces are\nintensive and independent of size. Also note that pressure is by convention calculated\nfrom the force exerted by the system on the walls, as opposed to the force on a spring\nwhich is exerted in the opposite direction. This is the origin of the negative sign that\nusually accompanies hydrostatic work.\nSystem\nForce\nDisplacement\nWire\nTension\nF\nLength\nL\nFilm\nSurface Tension\nS\nArea\nA\nFluid\nPressure\n-P\nVolume\nV\nMagnet\nMagnetic Field\nH\nMagnetization\nM\nDielectric\nElectric Field\nE\nPolarization\nP\nChemical Reaction\nChemical Potential μ\nParticle Number N\nTable 1: Generalized Forces and Displacements\nJoule's Free Expansion Experiment: Another important property of the ideal gas\nis the behavior of its internal energy. Observations indicate that if such a gas expands\nadiabatically (but not necessarily quasi-statically), from a volume Vi to Vf, the initial and\nfinal temperatures are the same. Since the transformation is adiabatic (ΔQ = 0) and\nthere is no external work done on the system (ΔW = 0), the internal energy of the gas\nis unchanged. Since the pressure and volume of the gas change in the process, but its\ntemperature does not, we conclude that the internal energy depends only on temperature,\ni.e. E(V, T) = E(T). This property of the ideal gas is in fact a consequence of the form of\nits equation of state as will be proved in test 1 review problems.\nResponse functions are the usual method for characterizing the macroscopic behav\nior of a system. They are experimentally measured from the changes of thermodynamic\ncoordinates with external probes. Some common response functions are:\nHeat Capacities are obtained from the change in temperature upon addition of heat to the\nsystem. Since heat is not a function of state, the path by which it is supplied must also be\nspecified. For example, for a gas we can calculate the heat capacities at constant volume\nor pressure, denoted by CV = dQ/dT|V and CP = dQ/dT|P respectively. The latter is\n\nlarger since some of the heat is used up in the work done in changes of volume:\ndQ\n\ndE -dW\ndE + PdV\n∂E\nCV =\n=\n=\n=\n,\ndT\ndT\ndT\n∂T\nV\nV\nV\nV\n\n(I.14)\ndQ\n\ndE -dW\ndE + PdV\n∂E\n∂V\nCP =\n=\n=\n=\n+ P\n.\ndT\ndT\ndT\n∂T\n∂T\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\n\nForce Constants measure the (infinitesimal) ratio of displacement to force and are gener\nalizations of the spring constant. Examples include the isothermal compressibility of a gas\nκT = - ∂V/∂P|T /V , and the susceptibility of a magnet χT = ∂M/∂B|T /V . From the\nequation of state of an ideal gas PV ∝ T, we obtain κT = 1/P.\nThermal Responses probe the change in the thermodynamic coordinates with temperature.\nFor example, the expansivity of a gas is given by αP = ∂V/∂T|P /V , which equals 1/T\nfor the ideal gas.\nSince the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, ∂E/∂T|V =\n∂E/∂T|P = dE/dT, and eq.(I.14) simplifies to\n\n∂V\nPV\nCP -CV = P\n\n= PV αP =\n≡ NkB.\n(I.15)\n∂T\nT\nP\nThe last equality follows from extensivity: for a given amount of ideal gas, the constant\nPV/T is proportional to N, the number of particles in the gas; the ratio is Boltzmann's\nconstant with a value of kB ≈ 1.4 × 10-23J0K-1 .\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "I.D The Second Law\nThe historical development of thermodynamics follows the industrial revolution in the\n19th century, and the advent of heat engines. It is interesting to see how such practical\nconsiderations as the efficiency of engines can lead to abstract ideas like entropy.\nAn idealized heat engine works by taking in a certain amount of heat QH, from a\nheat source (for example a coal fire), converting a portion of it to work W, and dumping\nthe remaining heat QC into a heat sink (e.g. atmosphere). The efficiency of the engine is\ncalculated from\nW\nQH -QC\nη =\n=\n≤ 1.\n(I.16)\nQH\nQH\nAn idealized refrigerator is like an engine running backward, i.e. using work W to\nextract heat QC from a cold system, and dumping heat QH at a higher temperature. We\ncan similarly define a figure of merit for the performance of a refrigerator as\nQC\nQC\nω =\n=\n.\n(I.17)\nW\nQH -QC\nThe first law rules out so called 'perpetual motion machines of the first kind', i.e.\nengines that produce work without consuming any energy. However, the conservation of\nenergy is not violated by an engine that produces work by converting water to ice. Such\na 'perpetual motion machine of the second kind' would certainly solve the world's energy\nproblems, but is ruled out by the second law of thermodynamics. The observation that\nthe natural direction for the flow of heat is from hotter to colder bodies is the content of\nthe second law of thermodynamics. There are a number of different formulations of the\nsecond law, such as the following two statements.\n- Kelvin's Statement: No process is possible whose sole result is the complete conversion\nof heat into work.\n- Clausius's Statement: No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat\nfrom a colder to a hotter body.\nA perfect engine is ruled out by the first statement, a perfect refrigerator by the\nsecond. In fact the two statements are equivalent as shown below.\nProof of the equivalence of the Kelvin and Clausius statements proceeds by showing that\nif one is violated so is the other.\n(a) Let us assume that there is a machine that violates Clausius's statement by taking\nheat Q from a cooler temperature TC to a higher temperature TH. Now consider\nan engine operating between these two temperature, taking heat QH from TH and\n\ndumping QC at TC. The combined system takes QH - Q from TH, produces work\nequal to QH -QC and dumps QC -Q at TC. If we adjust the engine output such that\nQC = Q, the net result is a 100% efficient engine, in violation of Kelvin's statement.\n(b) Alternatively, assume a machine that violates Kelvin's law by taking heat Q and\nconverting it completely to work. The work output of this machine can be used to\nrun a refrigerator, with the net outcome of transferring heat from a colder to a hotter\nbody, in violation of Clausius's statement.\nAlthough these statements may appear as rather trivial and qualitative descriptions,\nthey have important quantitative implications as demonstrated in the next sections.\nI.E Carnot Engines & Thermodynamic Temperature\n- A Carnot Engine is any engine that is reversible, runs in a cycle, with all of its heat\nexchanges taking place at a source temperature TH, and a sink temperature TC.\nA reversible process is one that can be run backward in time by simply reversing its\ninputs and outputs. It is the thermodynamic equivalent of frictionless motion in mechanics.\nSince time reversibility implies equilibrium, a reversible transformation must be quasi-\nstatic, but the reverse is not necessarily true (e.g., if there is energy dissipation due to\nfriction). An engine that runs in a cycle returns to its original internal state at the end of\nthe process. The distinguishing characteristic of the Carnot engine is that heat exchanges\nwith the surroundings are carried out only at two temperatures. The zeroth law allows us\nto select two isotherms at temperatures TH and TC for these heat exchanges. To complete\nthe Carnot cycle we have to connect these isotherms by reversible adiabatic paths in the\ncoordinate space. Since heat is not a function of state, we don't know how to construct\nsuch paths in general. Fortunately, we have sufficient information at this point to construct\na Carnot engine using an ideal gas as its internal working substance. For the purpose of\ndemonstration, let us compute the adiabatic curves for a monatomic ideal gas with an\ninternal energy\nE =\nNkBT =\nPV.\nAlong a quasi-static path\ndQ = dE - dW = d(2 PV ) + PdV = 2 PdV + 2 V dP.\n(I.18)\nThe adiabatic condition dQ = 0, then implies a path\n\ndP\n5 dV\nγ\n+\n= 0,\n=⇒\nPV\n= constant,\n(I.19)\nP\n3 V\n\nwith γ = 5/3. The adiabatic curves are clearly distinct from the isotherms, and we can\nselect two such curves to intersect our isotherms, thereby completing a Carnot cycle. The\nassumption of E ∝ T is not necessary, and in the test 1 review problems you will construct\nadiabatics for any E(T). In fact, a similar construction is possible for any two parameter\nsystem with E(J, x).\n- Carnot's Theorem: No engine operating between two reservoirs (at temperatures TH\nand TC) is more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between them.\nProof: Since a Carnot engine is reversible, it can be run backward as a refrigerator.\nUse the non-Carnot engine to run the Carnot engine backward. Let us denote the heat\nexchanges of the non-Carnot and Carnot engines by QH, QC, and Q′\nC, respectively.\nH, Q′\nThe net effect of the two engines is to transfer heat equal to QH -Q′\nQC -Q′ from\nH =\nC\nTH to TC. According to Clausius's statement, the quantity of transferred heat cannot be\nnegative, i.e. QH ≥ Q′\nSince the same quantity of work W, is involved in this process,\nH.\nwe conclude that\nW\nW\n≤\n,\n=⇒\nηCarnot ≥ ηnon-Carnot.\n(I.20)\nQH\nQH\n′\nCorollary: All reversible (Carnot) engines have the same universal efficiency η(TH, TC),\nsince each can be used to run the other one backward.\nThe Thermodynamic Temperature Scale: As shown earlier, it is at least theoretically\npossible to construct a Carnot engine using an ideal gas (or any other two parameter\nsystem) as working substance. We now find that independent of the material used, and\ndesign and construction, all such cyclic and reversible engines have the same maximum\ntheoretical efficiency. Since this maximum efficiency is only dependent on the two tem\nperatures, it can be used to construct a temperature scale. Such a temperature scale has\nthe attractive property of being independent of the properties of any material (e.g. the\nideal gas). To construct such a scale we first find out how η(TH, TC) depends on the two\ntemperatures. Consider two Carnot engines running in series, one between temperatures\nT1 and T2, and the other between T2 and T3 (T1 > T2 > T3). Denote the heat exchanges,\nand work outputs, of the two engines by Q1, Q2, W12, and Q2, Q3, W23 respectively. Note\nthat the heat dumped by the first engine is taken in by the second, so that the combined\neffect is another Carnot engine (since each component is reversible) with heat exchanges\nQ1, Q3, and work output W13 = W12 + W23. The three heats are related by\nQ2 = Q1 -W12 = Q1[1 -η(T1, T2)],\n\nH\nQ3 = Q2 -W23 = Q2[1 -η(T2, T3)] = Q1[1 -η(T1, T2)][1 -η(T2, T3)],\nQ3 = Q1 -W13 = Q2[1 -η(T1, T3)].\nComparison of the final two expressions yields\n[1 -η(T1, T3)] = [1 -η(T1, T2)][1 -η(T2, T3)].\n(I.21)\nThis property implies that 1 -η(T1, T2) can be written as a ratio of the form f(T2)/f(T1),\nwhich by convention is set to T2/T1, i.e.\nQ2\nT2\n1 -η(T1, T2) =\n≡\n,\nQ1\nT1\n(I.22)\nTH -TC\n=⇒ η(TH, TC) =\n.\nTH\nEq.(I.22) defines temperature up to a constant of proportionality, which is again set by\nchoosing the triple point of water, ice, and steam to 273.160K. Throughout this chapter,\nI have used the symbols Θ and T interchangeably. In fact, by running a Carnot cycle\nfor a perfect gas, it can be proved (see test 1 review problems) that the ideal gas and\nthermodynamic temperature scales are equivalent. Clearly the thermodynamic scale is not\nuseful from a practical stand-point; its advantage is conceptual, in that it is independent\nof the properties of any substance. All thermodynamic temperatures are positive, since\naccording to eq.(I.22) the heat extracted from a temperature T is proportional to it. If a\nnegative temperature existed, an engine operating between it and a positive temperature\nwould extract heat from both reservoirs and convert the sum total to work, in violation of\nKelvin's statement of the second law.\nI.F Entropy\nThe following theorem allows us to construct another function of state using the second\nlaw.\n- Clausius's Theorem: For any cyclic transformation (reversible or not),\ndQ/T ≤ 0,\n\nwhere\n.\ndQ refers to the heat increment supplied to the system at temperature T\nProof: We can subdivide the cycle into a series of infinitesimal transformations in which\nthe system receives energy in the form of heat\ndW. The system need not be\ndQ and work\nin equilibrium at each interval. Direct all the heat exchanges of the system to one port\nof a Carnot engine, which has another reservoir at a fixed temperature T0. Since the sign\n\nH\nI\nI\nH\nof dQ is not specified, the Carnot engine must operate a series of infinitesimal cycles in\neither direction. To deliver heat dQ to the system at some stage, the engine has to extract\nheat dQR from the fixed reservoir. If the heat is delivered to a part of the system which is\nlocally at a temperature T, then according to eq.(I.22),\ndQ\n\ndQR =\n.\n(I.23)\n\nT0 T\nAfter the cycle in completed, the system and the Carnot Engine return to their original\nstates. The net effect of the combined process is extracting heat QR =\ndQR from the\nreservoir and converting it to external work W. The work W = QR is the sum total of the\nwork elements done by the Carnot engine, and the work performed by the system in the\ncomplete cycle. By Kelvin's statement of the second law, QR = W ≤ 0, i.e.\ndQ\n\ndQ\nT0\n≤ 0,\n=⇒\n≤ 0,\n(I.24)\nT\nT\nsince T0 > 0. Note that T in eq.(I.24) refers to the temperature of the whole system\nonly for quasi-static processes in which it can be uniquely defined throughout the cycle.\nOtherwise, it is just a local temperature (say at a boundary of the system) at which the\nCarnot engine deposits the element of heat.\nConsequences of Clausius's theorem:\n(1) For a reversible cycle\ndQrev\n= 0, since by running the cycle in the opposite\n\n/T\ndirection\n→-\n, and by the above theorem\n/T is both non-negative and\ndQ\n\nrev\ndQrev\ndQrev\nnon-positive, hence zero. This result implies that the integral of\n/T between any two\ndQrev\npoints A and B is independent of path, since for two paths (1) and (2)\nZ B\n(1)\nZ A\n(2)\nZ B\n(1)\nZ B\n(2)\ndQ\ndQ\ndQ\ndQ\n\nrev\n\nrev\n\nrev\n\nrev\n+\n= 0,\n=⇒\n=\n.\n(I.25)\nA\nT1\nB\nT2\nA\nT1\nA\nT2\n(2) Using eq.(I.25) we can construct yet another function of state, the entropy S. Since\nthe integral is independent of path, and only depends on the two end points, we can set\nZ B dQrev\nS(B) -S(A) ≡\n.\n(I.26)\nT\nA\nFor reversible processes, we can now compute the heat from\n= TdS. This allows us\ndQrev\nto construct adiabatic curves for a general (multi-variable) system from the condition of\nconstant S. Note that eq.(I.26) only defines the entropy up to an overall constant.\n\nZ\nZ\nP\nX\n\n(3) Consider an irreversible change from A to B.

In particular,\nconsider adiabatically isolating a number of subsystems, each initially separately in equi\nlibrium. As they come to a state of joint equilibrium, since the net dQ\n\n= 0, we must have\nδS ≥ 0. Thus an adiabatic system attains a maximum value of entropy in equilibrium since\nspontaneous internal changes can only increase S. The direction of increasing entropy thus\npoints out the arrow of time, and the path to equilibrium.\n(4) For a reversible (hence quasi-static) transformation,\n=\ndW =\ni Jidxi,\ndQ\nTdS and\nand the first law implies\ndE = dQ + dW = TdS +\nJidxi .\n(I.28)\n\ni\nAlthough eq.(I.28) was obtained from a reversible transformation, as a relation between\nfunctions of state it is a generally valid identity of thermodynamics.

      "content": "I.G Approach to Equilibrium and Thermodynamic Potentials\nEvolution of non-equilibrium systems towards equilibrium is governed by the second\nlaw of thermodynamics. For example, in the previous section we showed that for an adia\nbatically isolated system entropy must increase in any spontaneous change and reaches a\nmaximum in equilibrium. What about out of equilibrium systems that are not adiabati\ncally isolated and which may also be subject to external mechanical work? It is usually\npossible to define other thermodynamic potentials that are extremized when the system is\nin equilibrium.\nEnthalpy is the appropriate function when there is no heat exchange (dQ\n\n= 0), and\nthe system comes to mechanical equilibrium with a constant external force. The minimum\nenthalpy principle merely formulates the observation that stable mechanical equilibrium\nis obtained by minimizing the net potential energy of the system plus the external agent.\nFor example, consider a spring of natural extension L0 and spring constant K, subject to\nthe force exerted by a particle of mass m. For an extension x = L-L0, the internal energy\nof the spring is Kx2/2, while there is a change of -mgx in the potential energy of the\nparticle. Mechanical equilibrium is obtained by minimizing Kx2/2 -mgx at an extension\nxeq = mg/K. The spring at any other value of the displacement initially oscillates before\ncoming to rest at xeq due to friction. For general displacements x, at constant generalized\nforces J, the work input to the system is dW\n\n≤ J· δx. (Equality is achieved for a reversible\nchange, but there is generally some loss of the external work into friction.)

Variations of G are given by\ndG = dE-d(TS)-d(J·x) = TdS+J·dx-SdT -TdS-x·dJ-J·dx = -SdT -x·dJ, (I.39)\nand most easily expressed in terms of (T, J).\ndQ = 0\nConstant T\n\ndW = 0\nδS ≥ 0\nδF ≤ 0\nConstant J\nδH ≤ 0\nδG ≤ 0\nTable 2: Inequalities satisfied by thermodynamic potentials.\nTable (2) summarizes the above results on thermodynamic functions.\nEqs.(I.30),\n(I.34), and (I.38) are examples of Legendre transformations, used to change variables\nto the most natural set of coordinates for describing a particular situation. So far, we\nimplicitly assumed a constant number of particles in the system. In chemical reactions,\nand in equilibrium between two phases, the number of particles in a given constituent\nmay change. The change in the number of particles necessarily involves changes in the\ninternal energy, which is expressed in terms of a chemical work\n= μ · dN.\nHere\ndW\nN = {N1, N2, · · ·} lists the number of particles of each species, and μ = {μ1, μ2, · · ·} the\nassociated chemical potentials which measure the work necessary to add additional particles\nto the system. Traditionally, chemical work is treated differently from mechanical work and\nis not subtracted from E in the Gibbs free energy of eq.(I.38). For chemical equilibrium\nin circumstances that involve no mechanical work, the appropriate state function is the\nGrand Potential given by\nG = E -TS -μ · N\n.\n(I.40)\nG(T, μ, x) is minimized in chemical equilibrium, and its variations in general satisfy\ndG = -SdT -J · dx -N · dμ\n.\n(I.41)\nExample: To illustrate the concepts of this section, consider N particles of supersaturated\nsteam in a container of volume V at a temperature T. How can we describe the approach\nof steam to an equilibrium mixture with Nw particles in the liquid and Ns particles in the\ngas phase? The fixed coordinates describing this system are V , T, and N. The appropriate\n\nX\nX\nthermodynamic function from Table (2) is the Helmholtz free energy F(V, T, N), whose\nvariations satisfy\ndF = d(E -TS) = -SdT -PdV + μdN.\n(I.42)\nBefore the system reaches equilibrium at a particular value of Nw, it goes through a series\nof non-equilibrium states with smaller amounts of water. If the process is sufficiently slow,\nwe can construct an out of equilibrium value for F as\nF(V, T, N|Nw) = Fw(T, Nw) + Fs(V, T, N -Nw),\n(I.43)\nwhich depends on an additional variable Nw. (It is assumed that the volume occupied by\nwater is small and irrelevant.) According to eq.(I.34), the equilibrium point is obtained by\nminimizing F with respect to this variable. Since\n∂Fw\n∂Fs\nδF =\nδNw -\nδNw,\n(I.44)\n∂Nw T,V\n∂Ns T,V\nand ∂F/∂N|T,V = μ from eq.(I.42), the equilibrium condition can be obtained by equating\nthe chemical potentials, i.e. from μw(V, T) = μs(V, T). The identity of chemical potentials\nis the condition for chemical equilibrium. Naturally, to proceed further we need expressions\nfor μw and μs.\nI.H Useful Mathematical Results\n(1) Extensivity: Including chemical work, variations of the extensive coordinates of the\nsystem are related by (generalizing eq.(I.28))\ndE = TdS + J · dx + μ · dN.\n(I.45)\nFor fixed intensive coordinates, the extensive quantities are simply proportional to size or\nto the number of particles. This proportionality is expressed mathematically by\nE(λS, λx, λN) = λE(S, x, N).\n(I.46)\nEvaluating the derivative of the above equation with respect to λ at λ = 1, results in\n∂E\n∂E\n∂E\n\nS +\n\nxi +\n\nNα = E(S, x, N) .\n(I.47)\n∂S\nx,N\ni\n∂xi S,xj6\nα\n∂Nα S,x,Nβ6\n=i,N\n=α\n\nThe partial derivatives in the above equation can be identified from eq.(I.45) as T, Ji, and\nμα respectively. Substituting these values into eq.(I.47) leads to the so called fundamental\nequation of thermodynamics\nE = TS + J · x + μ · N .\n(I.48)\nCombining the variations of eq.(I.48) with eq.(I.45) leads to a constraint between the\nvariations of intensive coordinates\nSdT + x · dJ + N · dμ = 0 ,\n(I.49)\nknown as the Gibbs-Duhem relation.\nExample: For a fixed amount of gas (dN = 0), variations of the chemical potential along\nan isotherm can be calculated as follows. Since dT = 0, the Gibbs-Duhem relation gives\n-V dP + Ndμ = 0, and\nV\ndP\ndμ =\ndP = kBT\n,\n(I.50)\nN\nP\nwhere we have used the ideal gas equation of state PV = NkBT. Integrating the above\nequation gives\nP\nV\nμ = μ0 + kBT ln\n= μ0 -kBT ln\n,\n(I.51)\nP0\nV0\nwhere (P0, V0, μ0) refer to the coordinates of a reference point.\n(2) Maxwell's Relations: Combining the mathematical rules of differentiation with\nthermodynamic relationships leads to several useful results.\nThe most important of\nthese are Maxwell's relations which follow from the commutative property [∂x∂yf(x, y) =\n∂y∂xf(x, y)] of derivatives. For example, it follows from eq.(I.45) that\n∂E\n∂E\n\n= T,\nand\n\n= Ji.\n(I.52)\n∂S\nx,N\n∂xi S,xj=\ni,N\nThe joint second derivative of E is then given by\n∂2E\n∂2E\n∂T\n∂Ji\n=\n=\n\n=\n.\n(I.53)\n∂S∂xi\n∂xi∂S\n∂xi S\n∂S\nxi\nSince (∂y/∂x) = (∂x/∂y)-1, the above equation can be inverted to give\n∂S\n∂xi\n\n=\n.\n(I.54)\n∂Ji xi\n∂T\nS\n\nSimilar identities can be obtained from the variations of other state functions. Sup\nposing that we are interested in finding an identity involving ∂S/∂x|T . We would like\nto find a state function whose variations include SdT and Jdx.\nThe correct choice is\ndF = d(E -TS) = -SdT +Jdx. Looking at the second derivative of F yields the Maxwell\nrelation\n∂S\n∂J\n-\n=\n.\n(I.55)\n∂x\n∂T\nT\nx\nTo calculate ∂S/∂J|T, consider d(E-TS-Jx) = -SdT -xdJ, which leads to the identity\n∂S\n∂x\n\n=\n.\n(I.56)\n∂J\n∂T\nT\nJ\nThere are a variety of mnemonics which are supposed to help you remember and construct\nMaxwell's equations, such as Magic Squares, Jacobians, etc. I personally don't find any of\nthese methods worth learning. The most logical approach is to remember the laws of ther\nmodynamics and hence eq.(I.28), and to then manipulate it so as to find the appropriate\nderivative using the rules of differentiation.\nExample: To obtain ∂μ/∂P|N,T for an ideal gas, start with d(E -TS + PV ) = -SdT +\nV dP + μdN. Clearly\n\n∂μ\n∂V\nV\nkBT\n\n=\n\n=\n=\n,\n(I.57)\n∂P\n∂N\nN\nP\nN,T\nT,P\nas in eq.(I.50). From eq.(I.28) it also follows that\n∂S\nP\n∂E/∂V |S,N\n\n=\n= -\n,\n(I.58)\n∂V\nE,N\nT\n∂E/∂S|V,N\nwhere we have used eq.(I.45) for the final identity. The above equation can be rearranged\ninto\n∂S\n∂E\n∂V\n\n= -1,\n(I.59)\n∂V\n∂S\n∂E\nE,N\nV,N\nS,N\nwhich is an illustration of the chain rule of differentiation.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "I.I Stability Conditions\nThe conditions derived in section I.G are similar to the well known requirements for\nmechanical stability.\nA particle moving in an external potential U settles to a stable\nequilibrium at a minimum value of U. In addition to the vanishing of the force -U ′ , this\nis a consequence of the loss of energy to frictional processes. Stable equilibrium occurs at\na minimum of the potential energy. For a thermodynamic system, equilibrium occurs at\nthe extremum of the appropriate potential, for example at the maximum value of entropy\nfor an isolated system.\nThe requirement that spontaneous changes should always lead\nto an increased entropy, places important constraints on equilibrium response functions,\ndiscussed in this section.\nConsider a homogeneous system at equilibrium, characterized by intensive state func\ntions (T, J, μ), and extensive variables (E, x, N). Now imagine that the system is arbitrar\nily divided into two equal parts, and that one part spontaneously transfers some energy\nto the other part in the form of work or heat. The two subsystems, A and B, initially\nhave the same values for the intensive variables, while their extensive coordinates satisfy\nEA + EB = E, xA + xB = x, and NA + NB = N. After the exchange of energy between\nthe two subsystems, the coordinates of A change to\n(EA + δE, xA + δx, NA + δN), and (TA + δTA, JA + δJA, μA + δμA),\n(I.60)\nand those of B to\n(EB -δE, xB -δx, NB -δN), and (TB + δTB, JB + δJB, μB + δμB).\n(I.61)\nNote that the overall system is maintained at constant E, x, and N. Since the inten\nsive variables are themselves functions of the extensive coordinates, to first order in the\nvariations of (E, x, N), we have\nδTA = -δTB ≡ δT,\nδJA = -δJB ≡ δJ,\nδμA = -δμB ≡ δμ.\n(I.62)\nUsing eq.(I.48), the entropy of the system can be written as\nEA\nJA\nμA\nEB\nJB\nμB\nS = SA + SB =\n-\n· xA -\n· NA\n+\n-\n· xB -\n· NB\n.\n(I.63)\nTA\nTA\nTA\nTB\nTB\nTB\n\nSince by assumption we are expanding about the equilibrium point, the first order changes\nvanish, and to second order\n\nJA\nμA\nδS = δSA + δSB = 2 δ\nδEA -δ\n· δxA -δ\n· δNA .\n(I.64)\nTA\nTA\nTA\n(We have used eq.(I.62) to note that the second order contribution of B is the same as A.)\nEq.(I.64) can be rearranged to\nδEA -JA · δxA -μA · δNA\nδS = -\nδTA\n+ δJA · δxA + δμA · δNA\nTA\nTA\n(I.65)\n= -\n[δTAδSA + δJA · δxA + δμA · δNA] .\nTA\nThe condition for stable equilibrium is that any change should lead to a decrease in entropy,\nand hence we must have\nδTδS + δJ · δx + δμ · δN ≥ 0.\n(I.66)\nWe have now removed the subscript A, as the above condition must apply to the whole\nsystem as well as to any part of it.\nThe above condition was obtained assuming that the overall system was kept at con\nstant E, x, and N. In fact, since all coordinates appear symmetrically in this expression,\nthe same result is obtained for any other set of constraints. For example, variations in δT\nand δx with δN = 0, lead to\n\n∂S\n∂S\n\nδS =\nδT +\nδxi\n\n∂T\n∂xi\nx\nT\n.\n(I.67)\n\n∂Ji\n∂Ji\n\nδJi =\nδT +\nδxj\n\n∂T\nx\n∂xj T\nSubstituting these variations into eq.(I.66) leads to\n∂S\n∂Ji\n(δT)2 +\n\nδxiδxj ≥ 0.\n(I.68)\n∂T\nx\n∂xj T\nNote that the cross terms proportional to δTδxi cancel due to the Maxwell relation in\neq.(I.56). Eq.(I.68) is a quadratic from, and must be positive for all choices of δT and δx.\nThe resulting constraints on the coefficients are independent of how the system was initially\npartitioned into subsystems A and B, and represent the conditions for stable equilibrium.\n\nIf only δT is non-zero, eq.(I.66) requires ∂S/∂T|x ≥ 0, implying a positive heat capacity,\nsince\n\n∂S\ndQ\nCx =\n= T\n\n≥ 0.\n(I.69)\ndT\n∂T\nx\nx\nIf only one of the δxi in eq.(I.66) is non-zero, the corresponding response function\n∂xi/∂Ji|T,xj\nmust be positive. However, a more general requirement exists since all δx\n=i\nvalues may be chosen non-zero. The general requirement is that the matrix of coefficients\n∂Ji/∂xj|T must be positive definite. A matrix is positive definite if all of its eigenvalues\nare positive. It is necessary, but not sufficient, that all the diagonal elements of such a\nmatrix (the inverse response functions) be positive, leading to further constraints between\nthe response functions. Including chemical work for a gas, the appropriate matrix is\n\" - ∂P\n- ∂P\n#\n∂V\nT,N\n∂N T,V\n∂μ\n∂μ\n.\n(I.70)\n∂V\n∂N\nT,N\nT,V\nIn addition to the positivity of the response functions κT,N = -V -1 ∂V/∂P|T,N and\n∂N/∂μ|T,V , the determinant of the matrix must be positive, requiring\n∂P\n∂μ\n∂P\n∂μ\n\n-\n\n≥ 0.\n(I.71)\n∂N\n∂V\n∂V\n∂N\nT,V\nT,N\nT,N\nT,V\nAnother interesting consequence of eq.(I.66) relates to the critical point of a gas where\n∂P/∂V |Tc,N = 0. Assuming that the critical isotherm can be analytically expanded as\n∂P\n1 ∂2P\n1 ∂3P\nδP(T = Tc) =\nδV +\n\nδV\n+\nδV\n+ · · · ,\n(I.72)\n∂V\n2 ∂V 2\n6 ∂V 3\nTc,N\nTc,N\nTc,N\nthe stability condition -δPδV ≥ 0 implies that ∂2P/∂V 2\nmust be zero, and the third\nTc,N\nderivative negative, if the first derivative vanishes. This condition is used to obtain the\ncritical point of the gas from mean-field approximations to the isotherms (such as the van\nder Waals isotherms). In fact, it is usually not justified to make a Taylor expansion around\nthe critical point as in eq.(I.72), although the constraint -δPδV ≥ 0 remains applicable.\n\nR\n\nI.J The Third Law\nDifferences in entropy between two states can be computed using the second law,\nfrom ΔS =\n\n/T. Low temperature experiments indicate that ΔS(X, T) vanishes as\ndQrev\nT goes to zero for any set of coordinates X. This observation is independent of the other\nlaws of thermodynamics, leading to the formulation of a third law by Nernst, which states\n- The entropy of all systems at zero absolute temperature is a universal constant that can\nbe taken to be zero.\nThe above statement actually implies that\nlim S(X, T) = 0,\n(I.73)\nT →0\nwhich is a stronger requirement than the vanishing of the differences ΔS(X, T).\nThis\nextended condition has been tested for metastable phases of a substance. Certain materials\nsuch as sulphur or phosphine can exist in a number of rather similar crystalline structures\n(allotropes). Of course, at a given temperature only one of these structures is truly stable.\nLet us imagine that as the high temperature equilibrium phase A, is cooled slowly, it makes\na transition at a temperature T ∗ to phase B, releasing latent heat L. Under more rapid\ncooling conditions the transition is avoided, and phase A persists in metastable equilibrium.\nThe entropies in the two phases can be calculated by measuring the heat capacities CA(T)\nand CB(T). Starting from T = 0, the entropy at a temperature slightly above T ∗ can be\ncomputed along the two possible paths as\n∗\n∗\nZ T\nZ T\nCA(T ′ )\nCB(T ′ )\nL\n∗\n′\n′\nS(T\n+ o) = SA(0) +\ndT\nT ′\n= SB(0) +\ndT\nT ′\n+ T ∗ .\n(I.74)\nSuch measurements have indeed verified that SA(0) = SB(0) ≡ 0.\nConsequences of the third law:\n(1) Since S(T = 0, X) = 0 for all coordinates X,\n∂S\nlim\n= 0.\n(I.75)\nT →0 ∂X T\n(2) Heat capacities must vanish as T → 0 since\nZ T\nCX(T ′ )\n′\nS(T, X) -S(0, X) =\ndT\n,\n(I.76)\nT ′\n\nand the integral diverges as T → 0 unless\nlim CX(T) = 0.\n(I.77)\nT →0\n(3) Thermal expansivities also vanish as T → 0 since\n\n1 ∂x\n1 ∂S\nαJ =\n\n=\n\n.\n(I.78)\nx ∂T\nx ∂J\nJ\nT\nThe second equality follows from the Maxwell relation in eq.(I.56). The vanishing of the\nlatter is guaranteed by eq.(I.75).\n(4) It is impossible to cool any system to absolute zero temperature in a finite number of\nsteps. For example, we can cool a gas by an adiabatic reduction in pressure. Since the\ncurves of S versus T for different pressures must join at T = 0, successive steps involve\nprogressively smaller changes, in S and in T, on approaching zero temperature. Alterna\ntively, the unattainability of zero temperatures implies that S(T = 0, P) is independent\nof P. This is a weaker statement of the third law which also implies the equality of zero\ntemperature entropy for different substances.\nIn the following sections, we shall attempt to justify the laws of thermodynamics from\na microscopic point of view. The first law is clearly a reflection of the conservation of\nenergy, which also operates at the microscopic level. The zeroth and second laws suggest\nan irreversible approach to equilibrium, a concept that has no analog at the particulate\nlevel. It is justified as reflecting the collective behavior of large numbers of degrees of\nfreedom. In statistical mechanics the entropy is calculated as S = kB ln g, where g is the\ndegeneracy of the states (number of configurations with the same energy). The third law\nof thermodynamics thus requires that g = 1 at T = 0, i.e. that the ground state of any\nsystem is unique. This condition does not hold within the framework of classical statisti\ncal mechanics, as there are examples of both non-interacting (such as an ideal gas), and\ninteracting (the frustrated spins in a triangular antiferromagnet) systems with degenerate\nground states, and a finite zero temperature entropy. However, classical mechanics is inap\nplicable at very low temperatures and energies where quantum effects become important.\nThe third law is then equivalent to the statement that the ground state of a quantum\nmechanical system is unique. While this can be proved for a non-interacting system, there\nis no general proof of its validity with interactions. Unfortunately, the onset of quantum\neffects (and other possible origins of the breaking of classical degeneracy) are system spe\ncific. Hence it is not a priori clear how low the temperature must be, before the predictions\n\nof the third law can be observed. Another deficiency of the law is its inapplicability to\nglassy phases. Glasses results from the freezing of supercooled liquids into configurations\nwith extremely slow dynamics. While not truly equilibrium phases (and hence subject to\nall the laws of thermodynamics), they are effectively so due to the slowness of the dynam\nics. A possible test of the applicability of the third law to glasses, is discussed in test #1\nreview problems.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "II. Probability\nII.A General Definitions\nThe laws of thermodynamics are based on observations of macroscopic bodies, and\nencapsulate their thermal properties. On the other hand, matter is composed of atoms\nand molecules whose motions are governed by fundamental laws of classical or quantum\nmechanics. It should be possible, in principle, to derive the behavior of a macroscopic\nbody from the knowledge of its components. This is the problem addressed by kinetic\ntheory in the following lectures. Actually, describing the full dynamics of the enormous\nnumber of particles involved is quite a daunting task. As we shall demonstrate, for dis\ncussing equilibrium properties of a macroscopic system, full knowledge of the behavior of\nits constituent particles is not necessary. All that is required is the likelihood that the\nparticles are in a particular microscopic state. Statistical mechanics is thus an inherently\nprobabilities description of the system. Familiarity with manipulations of probabilities is\ntherefore an important prerequisite to statistical mechanics. Our purpose here is to review\nsome important results in the theory of probability, and to introduce the notations that\nwill be used in the rest of the course.\nThe entity under investigation is a random variable x, which has a set of possible\noutcomes S ≡{x1, x2, · · ·}. The outcomes may be discrete as in the case of a coin toss,\nScoin = {head, tail}, or a dice throw, Sdice = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, or continuous as for the\nvelocity of a particle in a gas, Sv = {-inf< vx, vy, vz < inf}, or the energy of an electron\nin a metal at zero temperature, So = {0 ≤o ≤oF }. An event is any subset of outcomes\nE ⊂S, and is assigned a probability p(E), e.g. pdice({1}) = 1/6, or pdice({1, 3}) = 1/3.\nFrom an axiomatic point of view, the probabilities must satisfy the following conditions:\n(i) Positivity: p(E) ≥0, i.e. all probabilities must be non-zero.\n(ii) Additivity: p(A or B) = p(A) + p(B), if A and B are disconnected events.\n(iii) Normalization: p(S) = 1, i.e. the random variable must have some outcome in S.\nFrom a practical point of view, we would like to know how to assign probability values\nto various outcomes. There are two possible approaches:\n(1) Objective probabilities are obtained experimentally from the relative frequency of the\noccurrence of an outcome in many tests of the random variable. If the random process\nis repeated N times, and the event A occurs NA times, then\nNA\np(A) = lim\n.\nN→inf N\n\nFor example, a series of N = 100, 200, 300 throws of a dice may result in N1 =\n19, 30, 48 occurrences of 1. The ratios .19, .15, .16 provide an increasingly more\nreliable estimate of the probability pdice({1}).\n(2) Subjective probabilities provide a theoretical estimate based on the uncertainties\nrelated to lack of precise knowledge of outcomes.\nFor example, the assessment\npdice({1}) = 1/6, is based on the knowledge that there are six possible outcomes\nto a dice throw, and that in the absence of any prior reason to believe that the dice is\nbiased, all six are equally likely. All assignments of probability in Statistical Mechanics\nare subjectively based.The consequences of such subjective assignments of probability\nhave to be checked against measurements, and they may need to be modified as more\ninformation about the outcomes becomes available.\nII.B One Random Variable\nAs the properties of a discrete random variable are rather well known, here we focus\non continuous random variables, which are more relevant to our purposes.\nConsider a\nrandom variable x, whose outcomes are real numbers, i.e. Sx = {-inf< x < inf}.\n- The cumulative probability function (CPF) P(x), is the probability of an outcome with\nany value less than x, i.e. P(x) = prob.(E ⊂[-inf, x]). P(x) must be a monotonically\nincreasing function of x, with P(-inf) = 0 and P(+inf) = 1.\n- The probability density function (PDF) is defined by p(x) ≡dP(x)/dx. Hence, p(x)dx =\nprob.(E ⊂[x, x + dx]). As a probability density, it is positive, and normalized such that\nZ inf\nprob.(S) =\ndx p(x) = 1 .\n(II.1)\n-inf\nNote that since p(x) is a probability density, it has no upper bound, i.e. 0 < p(x) < inf.\n- The expectation value of any function F(x), of the random variable is\nZ inf\n⟨F(x)⟩=\ndx p(x)F(x) .\n(II.2)\n-inf\nThe function F(x) is itself a random variable, with an associated PDF of pF (f)df =\nprob.(F(x) ⊂[f, f + df]). There may be multiple solutions xi, to the equation F(x) = f,\nand\nX\nX\ndx\npF (f)df =\np(xi)dxi ,\n=\npF (f) =\np(xi)\n.\n(II.3)\n⇒\ndF\ni\ni\nx=xi\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\n*\n+\nX\nThe factors of dx/dF are the Jacobians associated with the change of variables from x\n|\n|\nto F. For example, consider p(x) = λ exp(-λ|x|)/2, and the function F(x) = x2 . There\nare two solutions to F(x) = f, located at x± = ±√f, with corresponding Jacobians\n| ± f -1/2/2|. Hence,\n\nλ\np\n\n-1\nλ exp -λ√f\nPF (f) =\nexp\nf\n+\n=\n,\n-λ\n2√f\n2√f\n2√f\nfor f > 0, and pF (f) = 0 for f < 0. Note that pF (f) has an (integrable) divergence at\nf = 0.\nMoments of the PDF are expectation values for powers of the random variable.

This makes\nthe computation of moments using the cluster expansion (eqs.(II.12)) particularly simple,\nand\n⟨x⟩= λ ,\nx 2 = σ2 + λ2 ,\n\n(II.18)\nx 3 = 3σ2λ + λ3 ,\nx 4 = 3σ4 + 6σ2λ2 + λ4 ,\n.\n· · ·\nThe normal distribution serves as the starting point for most perturbative computations\nin field theory. The vanishing of higher cumulants implies that all graphical computations\ninvolve only products of one point, and two point (known as propagators) clusters.\n(2) The binomial distribution: Consider a random variable with two outcomes A and B\n(e.g. a coin toss) of relative probabilities pA and pB = 1 -pA. The probability that in N\ntrials the event A occurs exactly NA times (e.g. 5 heads in 12 coin tosses), is given by the\nbinomial distribution\nN\nNA N-NA\npN(NA) =\npA pB\n.\n(II.19)\nNA\nThe prefactor,\nN\nN!\nNA\n= NA!(N -NA)! ,\n(II.20)\n\nX\n\nis just the coefficient obtained in the binomial expansion of (pA+pB)N, and gives the num\nber of possible orderings of NA events A and NB = N -NA events B. The characteristic\nfunction for this discrete distribution is given by\nN\n\n-ikNA\nN!\nNA N-NA\n-ikNA\n\n-ik\nN\np N(k) = e\n=\npA pB\ne\n= pAe\n+ pB\n.\nNA!(N -NA)!\nNA=0\n(II.21)\nThe resulting cumulant generating function is\nln pN(k) = N ln\n\npAe -ik + pB\n\n= N ln p1(k),\n(II.22)\nwhere ln p1(k) is the cumulant generating function for a single trial. Hence, the cumulants\nafter N trials are simply N times the cumulants in a single trial. In each trial, the allowed\nvalues of NA are 0 and 1 with respective probabilities pB and pA, leading to\nNA\nl\n= pA,\nfor all l. After N trials the first two cumulants are\n⟨NA⟩c = NpA\n,\n\nNA\n= N(pA -p 2\nA) = NpApB\n.\n(II.23)\nc\nA measure of fluctuations around the mean is provided by the standard deviation, which is\nthe square root of the variance. While the mean of the binomial distribution scales as N,\nits standard deviation only grows as\n√\nN. Hence, the relative uncertainty becomes smaller\nfor large N.\nThe binomial distribution is straightforwardly generalized to a multinomial distribu\ntion, when the several outcomes {A, B,\n, M} occur with probabilities {pA, pB,\n, pM}.\n· · ·\n· · ·\nThe probability of finding outcomes {NA, NB,\n, NM} in a total of N = NA+NB\n+NM\n· · ·\n· · ·\ntrials is\npN ({NA, NB,\n, NM}) =\nN!\np NA p NB\np NM .\n(II.24)\n· · ·\nNA!NB!\nNM!\nA\nB\n· · ·\nM\n· · ·\n(3) The Poisson distribution: The classical example of a Poisson process is radioactive\ndecay. Observing a piece of radioactive material over a time interval T shows that:\n(a) The probability of one and only one event (decay) in the interval [t, t + dt] is propor\ntional to dt as dt\n0,\n→\n(b) The probabilities of events at different intervals are independent of each other.\nThe probability of observing exactly M decays in the interval T is given by the Poisson\ndistribution.\nIt is obtained as a limit of the binomial distribution by subdividing the\ninterval into N = T/dt ≫1 segments of size dt. In each segment, an event occurs with\nprobability p = αdt, and there is no event with probability q = 1-αdt. As the probability\n\nX\n\nof more than one event in dt is too small to consider, the process is equivalent to a binomial\none. Using eq.(II.21), the characteristic function is given by\nn\n\nT/dt\n\np (k) = pe -ik + q\n= lim\n1 + αdt e -ik -1\n= exp α(e -ik -1)T\n.\n(II.25)\ndt→0\nThe Poisson PDF is obtained from the inverse Fourier transform in eq.(II.6) as\nZ inf\nZ inf\ninf\ndk\n\n-ik\n\n-αT\ndk\nikx\n(αT)M\n-ikM\np(x) =\nexp α e\n-1 T + ikx = e\ne\ne\n,\n2π\n2π\nM!\n-inf\n-inf\nM=0\n(II.26)\nusing the power series for the exponential. The integral over k is\nZ inf dk e ik(x-M) = δ(x -M) ,\n(II.27)\n2π\n-inf\nleading to\ninf\nX\n-αT (αT)M\npαT (x) =\ne\nδ(x -M) .\n(II.28)\nM!\nm=0\nThe probability of M events is thus pαT (M) = e-αT (αT)M/M!. The cumulants of the\ndistribution are obtained from the expansion\ninf\nln pαT (k) = αT(e -ik -1) = αT\nX (-\nn\nik\n!\n)n\n,\n= ⇒\n⟨M n ⟩c = αT\n.\n(II.29)\nn=1\nAll cumulants have the same value, and the moments are obtained from eqs.(II.12) as\n⟨M⟩= (αT),\n\nM 2\n= (αT)2 + (αT),\n\nM 3\n= (αT)3 + 3(αT)2 + (αT).\n(II.30)\nExample: Assuming that stars are randomly distributed in the galaxy (clearly unjustified)\nwith a density n, what is the probability that the nearest star is at a distance R?\nSince, the probability of finding a star in a small volume dV is ndV , and they are\nassumed to be independent, the number of stars in a volume V is described by a Poisson\nprocess as in eq.(II.28), with α = n. The probability p(R), of encountering the first star\nat a distance R is the product of the probabilities pnV (0), of finding zero stars in the\nvolume V = 4πR3/3 around the origin, and pndV (1), of finding one star in the shell of\nvolume dV = 4πR2dR at a distance R. Both pnV (0) and pndV (1) can be calculated from\neq.(II.28), and\np(R)dR = pnV (0) pndV (1) =e -4πR3n/3 e -4πR2ndR 4πR2ndR,\n4π\n(II.31)\n=\np(R) =4πR2 n exp\nR3 n\n.\n⇒\n-3\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

For example, describing the location and velocity of a\ngas particle requires six coordinates.\n-\nThe joint PDF p(x), is the probability density of an outcome in a volume element\ndNx = QN\ndxi around the point x = {x1, x2,\n, xN}. The joint PDF is normalized\ni=1\n· · ·\nsuch that\npx(S) =\ndN x p(x) = 1 .\n(II.32)\nIf, and only if, the N random variables are independent, the joint PDF is the product of\nindividual PDFs,\nN\np(x) =\npi(xi)\n.\n(II.33)\ni=1\n- The unconditional PDF describes the behavior of a subset of random variables, indepen\ndent of the values of the others. For example, if we are interested only in the location of\na gas particle, an unconditional PDF can be constructed by integrating over all velocities\nat a given location, p(x) =\nd3v p(x,v); more generally\nZ\nN\np(x1,\n, xm) =\ndxi p(x1,\n, xN) .\n(II.34)\n· · ·\n· · ·\ni=m+1\n- The conditional PDF describes the behavior of a subset of random variables, for specified\nvalues of the others. For example, the PDF for the velocity of a particle at a particular\nlocation x, denoted by p(v | x), is proportional to the joint PDF p(v | x) = p(x,v)/N.\nThe constant of proportionality, obtained by normalizing p(v\nx), is\n|\nN =\nd3v p(x,v) = p(x),\n(II.35)\nthe unconditional PDF for a particle at x. In general, the unconditional PDFs are obtained\nfrom Bayes' Theorem as\np(x1,\nxm+1,\np(x1, · · · , xN)\n· · · , xm |\n· · · , xN) = p(xm+1,\n, xN)\n.\n(II.36)\n· · ·\nNote that if the random variables are independent, the unconditional PDF is equal to the\nconditional PDF.\n\nZ\n*\n+\nX\n\"\n#\nX\n\n- The expectation value of a function F(x), is obtained as before from\n⟨F(x)⟩=\ndN x p(x)F(x) .\n(II.37)\n- The joint characteristic function, is obtained from the N-dimensional Fourier transfor\nmation of the joint PDF,\n\nN\np (k) =\nexp -i\nkjxj\n.\n(II.38)\nj=1\nThe joint moments and joint cumulants are generated by p(k) and ln p(k) respectively, as\n\nn1\nn2\n\nnN\n∂\n∂\n∂\n⟨x1\nn1 x2\nn2 · · · xN\nnN ⟩=\n∂(-ik1)\n∂(-ik2)\n· · · ∂(-ikN)\np (k = 0)\n,\n\nn1\nn2\n\nnN\n(II.39)\n∂\n∂\n∂\n⟨x1\nn1 x2\nn2 · · · xN\nnN ⟩c =\n∂(-ik1)\n∂(-ik2)\n· · · ∂(-ikN)\nln p(k = 0)\n.\nThe previously described graphical relation between joint moments (all clusters of labelled\npoints), and joint cumulant (connected clusters) is still applicable. For example\n\n⟨xαxβ\n\n⟩= ⟨xα⟩c\n⟨xβ⟩c + ⟨\n\nxαx\n\nβ⟩c\n,\nand\n\n(II.40)\nxα\n2 xβ\n= ⟨xα⟩c ⟨xβ⟩c + xα\nc ⟨xβ⟩c + 2 ⟨xαxβ⟩c ⟨xα⟩c + xα\n2 xβ\nc\n.\nThe connected correlation, ⟨xαxβ⟩c, is zero if xα and xβ are independent random variables.\n- The joint Gaussian distribution is the generalization of eq.(II.15) to N random variables,\nas\n\np(x) = p\n(2π)N det[C]\nexp -2 mn\nC-1\nmn (xm -λm)(xn -λn)\n,\n(II.41)\nwhere C is a symmetric matrix, and C-1 is its inverse,.\nThe simplest way to get the\nnormalization factor is to make a linear transformation from the variables yj = xj -λj,\nusing the unitary matrix that diagonalizes C. This reduces the normalization to that of\nthe product of N Gaussians whose variances are determined by the eigenvalues of C. The\nproduct of the eigenvalues is the determinant det[C]. (This also indicates that the matrix\nC must be positive definite.) The corresponding joint characteristic function is obtained\nby similar manipulations, and is given by\np (k) = exp -ikmλm -\nCmnkmkn\n,\n(II.42)\n\nX\nY\n*\n+\nX\nX\nX\n\nQ\nQ\nwhere the summation convention is used.\nThe joint cumulants of the Gaussian are then obtained from ln p(k) as\n⟨xm⟩c = λm\n,\n⟨xmxn⟩c = Cmn\n,\n(II.43)\nwith all higher cumulants equal to zero. In the special case of {λm} = 0, all odd moments\nof the distribution are zero, while the general rules for relating moments to cumulants\nindicate that any even moment is obtained by summing over all ways of grouping the\ninvolved random variables into pairs, e.g.\n⟨xaxbxcxd⟩= CabCcd + CacCbd + CadCbc.\n(II.44)\nThis result is sometimes referred to as Wick's theorem.\nII.E Sums of Random Variables & the Central Limit Theorem\nPN\nConsider the sum X =\ni=1 xi, where xi are random variables with a joint PDF of\np(x). The PDF for X is\nZ\nZ N-1\npX(x) =\ndN x p(x)δ\nx -\nxi\n=\ndxi p (x1, · · · , xN-1, x -x1 · · · - xN-1) ,\ni=1\n(II.45)\nand the corresponding characteristic function (using eq.(II.38)) is given by\n\nN\np X(k) =\nexp -ik\nxj\n= p (k1 = k2 =\n= kN = k) .\n(II.46)\n· · ·\nj=1\nCumulants of the sum are obtained by expanding ln pX(k),\nN\nN\nln p (k1 = k2 =\n= kN = k) = -ik\nX\n⟨xi1 ⟩c + (-ik)2 X\n⟨xi1 xi2 ⟩c +\n,\n(II.47)\n· · ·\n· · ·\ni1=1\ni1,i2\nas\nN\nN\n⟨X⟩c =\n⟨xi⟩c\n,\nX2\nc =\n⟨xixj⟩c\n,\n.\n(II.48)\n· · ·\ni=1\ni,j\nIf the random variables are independent, p(x) =\npi(xi), and pX(k) =\np i(k).\nThe cross-cumulants in eq.(II.48) vanish, and the nth cumulant of X is simply the sum\nPN\nof the individual cumulants, ⟨Xn⟩c =\ni=1 ⟨xi\nn⟩c .\nWhen all the N random variables\n\n!\n\nare independently taken from the same distribution p(x), this implies ⟨Xn⟩c = N ⟨xn⟩c,\ngeneralizing the result obtained previously for the binomial distribution. For large values\nof N, the average value of the sum is proportional to N, while fluctuations around the\nmean, as measured by the standard deviation, grow only as\n√\nN. The random variable\nn\nN 1-m/2\ny = (X -N ⟨x⟩c)/\n√\nN, has zero mean, and cumulants that scale as ⟨y ⟩c ∝\n. As\nN →inf, only the second cumulant survives, and the PDF for y converges to the normal\ndistribution ,\nPN\n\nlim p\ny =\ni=1 xi -N ⟨x⟩c\n= p 1\nexp\ny2\n.\n(II.49)\nN→inf\n√\nN\n2π ⟨x2⟩c\n-2 ⟨x2⟩c\n(Note that the Gaussian distribution is the only distribution with only first and second\ncumulants.)\nThe convergence of the PDF for the sum of many random variables to a normal\ndistribution is a most important result in the context of statistical mechanics where such\nsums are frequently encountered. The central limit theorem states a more general form of\nthis result: It is not necessary for the random variables to be independent, as the condition\nPN\ni1,···,im ⟨xi1\nxim ⟩c ≪O(N m/2), is sufficient for the validity of eq.(II.49).\n· · ·\nII.F Rules for Large Numbers\nTo describe equilibrium properties of macroscopic bodies, statistical mechanics has to\ndeal with the very large number N, of microscopic degrees of freedom. Actually, taking\nthe thermodynamic limit of N →inf leads to a number of simplifications, some of which\nare described in this section.\nThere are typically three types of N dependence encountered in the thermodynamic\nlimit:\n(a) Intensive quantities, such as temperature T, and generalized forces, e.g. pressure P,\nand magnetic field B, are independent of N, i.e. O(N 0).\n(b) Extensive quantities, such as energy E, entropy S, and generalized displacements, e.g.\nvolume V , and magnetization M, are proportional to N, i.e. O(N 1).\n(c) Exponential dependence, i.e. O exp(Nφ) , is encountered in enumerating discrete\nmicro-states, or computing available volumes in phase space.\nOther asymptotic dependencies are certainly not ruled out a priori. For example, the\nCoulomb energy of N ions at fixed density scales as Q2/R ∼N 5/3 . Such dependencies\nare rarely encountered in every day physics. The Coulomb interaction of ions is quickly\n\nX\n\nZ\n\nscreened by counter-ions, resulting in an extensive overall energy. (This is not the case in\nastrophysical problems since the gravitational energy can not be screened. For example\nthe entropy of a black hole is proportional to the square of its mass.)\nIn statistical mechanics we frequently encounter sums or integrals of exponential vari\nables. Performing such sums in the thermodynamic limit is considerably simplified due to\nthe following results.\n(1) Summation of Exponential Quantities\nConsider the sum\nN\nS =\nEi\n,\n(II.50)\ni=1\nwhere each term is positive, with an exponential dependence on N,\n0 ≤Ei ∼O exp(Nφi) ,\n(II.51)\nand the number of terms N, is proportional to some power of N. Such a sum can be\napproximated by its largest term Emax, in the following sense. Since for each term in the\nsum, 0 ≤Ei ≤Emax,\nEmax ≤S ≤N Emax .\n(II.52)\nAn intensive quantity can be constructed from ln S/N, which is bounded by\nln E\nN\nmax ≤ ln\nN\nS ≤ ln E\nN\nmax + ln\nN\nN .\n(II.53)\nFor N ∝N p, the ratio ln N /N vanishes in the large N limit, and\nlim\nN→inf\nln S\nN\n= ln Emax\nN\n= φmax\n.\n(II.54)\n(2) Saddle Point Integration\nSimilarly, an integral of the form\nI =\nZ\ndx exp\n\nNφ(x)\n\n,\n(II.55)\ncan be approximated by the maximum value of the integrand, obtained at a point xmax\nwhich maximizes the exponent φ(x). Expanding around this point,\nI =\ndx exp\nN\nφ(xmax) -2\n1 |φ ′′ (xmax)|(x -xmax)2 + · · ·\n.\n(II.56)\n\nZ\n\ns\n\nNote that at the maximum, the first derivative φ ′ (xmax), is zero, while the second derivative\nφ ′′ (xmax), is negative. Terminating the series at the quadratic order results in\nI ≈e Nφ(xmax )\ndx exp - N\n2 |φ ′′ (xmax)|(x -xmax)2 ≈\nN φ′′\n(\nπ\nxmax) e Nφ(xmax ), (II.57)\n|\n|\nwhere the range of integration has been extended to [-inf, inf]. The latter is justified since\nthe integrand is negligibly small outside the neighborhood of xmax.\nThere are two types of correction to the above result. Firstly, there are higher or\nder terms in the expansion of φ(x) around xmax.\nThese corrections can be looked at\nperturbatively, and lead to a series in powers of 1/N.\nSecondly, there may be addi\n′\ntional local maxima for the function.\nA maximum at xmax, leads to a similar Gaus\nsian integral that can be added to eq.(II.57). Clearly such contributions are smaller by\n′\nO exp{-N[φ(xmax)-φ(x\n)]} . Since all these corrections vanish in the thermodynamic\nmax\nlimit,\nlim ln I = lim\n\nφ(xmax) -\n1 ln\nN|φ ′′ (xmax)|\n+ O( 1 )\n\n= φ(xmax)\n.\n(II.58)\nN→inf N\nN→inf\n2N\n2π\nN 2\nThe saddle point method for evaluating integrals is the extension of the above result to\nmore general integrands, and integration paths in the complex plane. (The appropriate\nextremum in the complex plane is a saddle point.) The simplified version presented above\nis sufficient for the purposes of this course.\n- Stirling's approximation for N! at large N can be obtained by saddle point integration.\nIn order to get an integral representation of N!, start with the result\nZ inf\ndxe-αx = 1 .\n(II.59)\nα\nRepeated differentiation of both sides of the above equation with respect to α leads to\nZ inf\ndxxN e -αx =\nN! .\n(II.60)\nαN+1\nAlthough the above result only applies to integer N, it is possible to define by analytical\ncontinuation a function,\nZ inf\nΓ(N + 1) ≡N! =\ndxxN e -x ,\n(II.61)\n\nX\nfor all N. While the integral in eq.(II.61) is not exactly in the form of eq.(II.55), it can\nstill be evaluated by a similar method. The integrand can be written as exp Nφ(x) , with\nφ(x) = ln x -x/N. The exponent has a maximum at xmax = N, with φ(xmax) = ln N -1,\nand φ ′′ (xmax) = -1/N 2 . Expanding the integrand in eq.(II.61) around this point yields,\nN! ≈\nZ\ndx exp\n\nN ln N -N -2\nN (x -N)2\n≈N N e -N√\n2πN,\n(II.62)\nwhere the integral is evaluated by extending its limits to [-inf, inf]. Stirling's formula is\nobtained by taking the logarithm of eq.(II.62) as,\nln N! = N ln N -N +\nln(2πN) + O(\n).\n(II.63)\nN\nII.G Information, Entropy, and Estimation\n-\nInformation: Consider a random variable with a discrete set of outcomes S = {xi},\noccurring with probabilities {p(i)}, for i = 1,\n, M. In the context of information theory,\n· · ·\nthere is a precise meaning to the information content of a probability distribution: Let us\nconstruct a message from N independent outcomes of the random variable. Since there are\nM possibilities for each character in this message, it has an apparent information content of\nN ln2 M bits; i.e. this many binary bits of information have to be transmitted to convey the\nmessage precisely. On the other hand, the probabilities {p(i)} limit the types of messages\nthat are likely. For example, if p2\np1, it is very unlikely to construct a message with\n≫\nmore x1 than x2. In particular, in the limit of large N, we expect the message to contain\n\"roughly\" {Ni = Npi} occurrences of each symbol.+ The number of typical messages thus\ncorresponds to the number of ways of rearranging the {Ni} occurrences of {xi}, and is\ngiven by the multinomial coefficient\nN!\ng = QM\n.\n(II.64)\nNi!\ni=1\nThis is much smaller than the total number of messages M n . To specify one out of g\npossible sequences requires\nM\nln2 g ≈-N\npi ln2 pi\n(for N →inf),\n(II.65)\ni=1\n+ More precisely, the probability of finding any Ni that is different from Npi by more\nthan ±\n√\nN becomes exponentially small in N, as N →inf.\n\nX\nX\n\nbits of information. The last result is obtained by applying Stirling's approximation for\nln N!. It can also be obtained by noting that\n\n!N\nM\nNi\nM\n1 =\nX\npi\n=\nX\nN!\nY p\nN\ni\ni! ≈g\nY\npNpi ,\n(II.66)\ni\ni\n{Ni}\ni=1\ni=1\nwhere the sum has been replaced by its largest term, as justified in the previous section.\nShannon's Theorem proves more rigorously that the minimum number of bits necessary\nto ensure that the percentage of errors in N trials vanishes in the N →inflimit, is ln2 g.\nFor any non-uniform distribution, this is less than the N ln2 M bits needed in the absence\nof any information on relative probabilities. The difference per trial is thus attributed to\nthe information content of the probability distribution, and is given by\nM\nI [{pi}] = ln2 M +\npi ln2 pi\n.\n(II.67)\ni=1\n- Entropy: Eq.(II.64) is encountered frequently in statistical mechanics in the context of\nmixing M distinct components; its natural logarithm is related to the entropy of mixing.\nMore generally, we can define an entropy for any probability distribution as\nM\nS =\np(i) ln p(i) =\n(II.68)\n-\n-⟨ln p(i)⟩\n.\ni=1\nThe above entropy takes a minimum value of zero for the delta-function distribution\np(i) = δi,j, and a maximum value of ln M for the uniform distribution, p(i) = 1/M. S\nis thus a measure of dispersity (disorder) of the distribution, and does not depend on the\nvalues of the random variables {xi}.\nA one to one mapping to fi = F(xi) leaves the\nentropy unchanged, while a many to one mapping makes the distribution more ordered\nand decrease S. For example, if the two values, x1 and x2, are mapped onto the same f,\nthe change in entropy is\np1\np2\nΔS(x1, x2\nf) =\np1 ln\n+ p2 ln\n< 0.\n(II.69)\n→\np1 + p2\np1 + p2\n- Estimation: The entropy S, can also be used to quantify subjective estimates of probabil\nities. In the absence of any information, the best unbiased estimate is that all M outcomes\nare equally likely. This is the distribution of maximum entropy. If additional information\nis available, the unbiased estimate is obtained by maximizing the entropy subject to the\n\nX\nX\nX\n\n!\n\n!\n\nZ\nconstraints imposed by this information. For example, if it is known that ⟨F(x)⟩= f, we\ncan maximize\nS (α, β, {pi}) = -\np(i) ln p(i) -α\np(i) -1\n-β\np(i)F(xi) -f\n,\n(II.70)\ni\ni\ni\nwhere the Lagrange multipliers α and β are introduced to impose the constraints of nor\nmalization, and ⟨F(x)⟩= f, respectively. The result of the optimization is a distribution\npi ∝exp\n-βF(xi) , where the value of β is fixed by the constraint. This process can\nbe generalized to an arbitrary number of conditions. It is easy to see that if the first n\nmoments (and hence n cumulants) of a distribution are specified, the unbiased estimate is\nthe exponential of an nth order polynomial.\nIn analogy with eq.(II.68), we can define an entropy for a continuous random variable\n(Sx = {-inf< x < inf}) as\nS = -\ndx p(x) ln p(x) = -⟨ln p(x)⟩\n.\n(II.71)\nThere are, however, problems with this definition, as for example S is not invariant under\na one to one mapping. (After a change of variable to f = F(x), the entropy is changed\nby ⟨|F ′ (x)|⟩.) Since the Jacobian of a canonical transformation is unity, canonically con\njugate pairs offer a suitable choice of coordinates in classical statistical mechanics. The\nambiguities are also removed if the continuous variable is discretized. This happens quite\nnaturally in quantum statistical mechanics where it is usually possible to work with a\ndiscrete ladder of states. The appropriate volume for discretization of phase space is set\nby Planck's constant h.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "III. Kinetic Theory of Gases\nIII.A General Definitions\n- Kinetic theory studies the macroscopic properties of large numbers of particles, start\ning from their (classical) equations of motion.\nThermodynamics describes the equilibrium behavior of macroscopic objects in terms\nof concepts such as work, heat, and entropy. The phenomenological laws of thermody\nnamics tell us how these quantities are constrained as a system approaches its equilibrium.\nAt the microscopic level, we know that these systems are composed of particles (atoms,\nmolecules), whose interactions and dynamics are reasonably well understood in terms of\nmore fundamental theories. If these microscopic descriptions are complete, we should be\nable to account for the macroscopic behavior, i.e. derive the laws governing the macro\nscopic state functions in equilibrium. Kinetic theory attempts to achieve this objective.\nIn particular, we shall try to answer the following questions:\n(1) How can we define \"equilibrium\" for a system of moving particles?\n(2) Do all systems naturally evolve towards an equilibrium state?\n(3) What is the time evolution of a system that is not quite in equilibrium?\nThe simplest system to study, the veritable work-horse of thermodynamics, is the\ndilute (nearly ideal) gas. A typical volume of gas contains of the order of 1023 particles.\nKinetic theory attempts to deduce the macroscopic properties of the gas from the time\nevolution of the individual atomic coordinates. At any time t, the microstate of a system\nof N particles is described by specifying the positions qi(t), and momenta pi(t), of all\nparticles. The microstate thus corresponds to a point μ(t), in the 6N dimensional phase\nQN\nspace Γ =\ni=1{qi, pi}. The time evolution of this point is governed by the canonical\nequations\n∂qi\n∂H\n\n=\n∂t\n∂pi\n,\n(III.1)\n∂pi\n∂H\n\n= -\n∂t\n∂qi\nwhere the Hamiltonian H(p, q), describes the total energy in terms of the set of coordinates\nq ≡{q1, q2, · · · , qN}, and momenta p ≡{p1, p2, · · · , pN}. The microscopic equations of\nmotion have time reversal symmetry, i.e. if all the momenta are suddenly reversed, p →\n-p, at t = 0, the particles retrace their previous trajectory, q(t) = q(-t). This follows\nfrom the invariance of H under the transformation T(p, q) → (-p, q).\n\nR\nZ\nAs formulated within thermodynamics, the macrostate M, of an ideal gas in equi\nlibrium is described by a small number of state functions such as E, T, P, and N. The\nspace of macrostates is considerably smaller than the phase space spanned by microstates.\nTherefore, there must be a very large number of microstates μ corresponding to the same\nmacrostate M.\nThis many to one correspondence suggests the introduction of a statistical ensemble\nof microstates. Consider N copies of a particular macrostate, each described by a different\nrepresentative point μn(t), in the phase space Γ.\nLet dN (p, q, t) equal the number of\nQN\nrepresentative points in an infinitesimal volume dΓ =\ni=1 d3pid3qi around the point\n(p, q). A phase space density ρ(p, q, t) is then defined from\ndN(p, q, t)\nρ(p, q, t)dΓ =\nlim\n.\n(III.2)\nN →inf\nN\nThis quantity can be compared with the objective probability introduced in the previous\nsection. Clearly\ndΓρ = 1, and ρ is a properly normalized probability density function in\nphase space. To compute macroscopic values for various functions O(p, q), we shall use\nthe ensemble averages\nhOi =\ndΓρ(p, q, t)O(p, q).\n(III.3)\nWhen the exact microstate μ is specified, the system is said to be in a pure state.\nOn the other hand, when our knowledge of the system is probabilistic, in the sense of its\nbeing taken from an ensemble with density ρ(Γ), it is said to belong to a mixed state. It\nis difficult to describe equilibrium in the context of a pure state, since μ(t) is constantly\nchanging in time according to eqs.(III.1). Equilibrium is more conveniently described for\nmixed states by examining the time evolution of the phase space density ρ(t), which is\ngoverned by the Liouville's equation introduced in the next section.\nIII.B Liouville's Theorem\n-\nLiouville's Theorem states that the phase space density ρ(Γ, t), behaves like an\nincompressible fluid.\nProof:\nFollow the evolution of dN pure states in an infinitesimal volume dΓ =\nQN\nd3pid3qi around the point (p, q). According to eqs.(III.1), after an interval δt these\ni=1\nstates have moved to the vicinity of another point (p ′ , q ′), where\n′\n′\nqα = qα + qαδt + O(δt2)\n,\npα = pα + pαδt + O(δt2).\n(III.4)\n\nX\nIn the above expression, the qα and pα refer to any of the 6N coordinates and momenta,\nand qα and pα are the corresponding velocities. The original volume element dΓ, is in the\nshape of a hyper-cube of sides dpα and dqα. In the time interval δt it gets distorted, and\nthe projected sides of the new volume element are given by\n\ndq α\n′ =dqα + ∂q α dqαδt + O(δt2)\n\n∂qα\n.\n(III.5)\n\n∂p α\n\nα =dpα +\ndp ′\ndpαδt + O(δt2)\n∂pα\nQN\n′\nTo order of δt2, the new volume element is dΓ′ =\ni=1 d3pi ′d3qi . From eqs.(III.5) it\nfollows that for each pair of conjugate coordinates\ndq α\n′\ndp ′\ndqα dpα\n∂q α + ∂p α\n.\n·\nα =\n·\n1 +\nδt + O(δt2)\n(III.6)\n∂qα\n∂pα\nBut since the time evolution of coordinates and momenta are governed by the canonical\neqs.(III.1), we have\n∂q α\n∂\n∂H\n∂2H\n∂p α\n∂\n\n∂H\n∂2H\n=\n=\n,\nand\n=\n-\n= -\n.\n(III.7)\n∂qα\n∂qα ∂pα\n∂pα∂qα\n∂pα\n∂pα\n∂qα\n∂qα∂pα\nThus the projected area in eq.(III.6) is unchanged for any pair of coordinates, and hence\nthe volume element is unaffected, dΓ′ = dΓ. All the pure states dN , originally in the\nvicinity of (p, q) are transported to the neighborhood of (p ′ , q ′), but occupy exactly the\nsame volume. The ratio dN/dΓ is left unchanged, and ρ behaves like the density of an\nincompressible fluid.\nThe incompressibility condition ρ(p ′ , q ′ , t + δt) = ρ(p, q, t), can be written in differ\nential form as\n3N\n\ndρ\n∂ρ\n∂ρ\ndpα\n∂ρ\ndqα\n=\n+\n·\n+\n·\n= 0.\n(III.8)\ndt\n∂t\n∂pα\ndt\n∂qα\ndt\nα=1\nNote the distinction between ∂ρ/∂t and dρ/dt: The former partial derivative refers to the\nchanges in ρ at a particular location in phase space, while the latter total derivative follows\nthe evolution of a volume of fluid as it moves in phase space. Substituting from eq.(III.1)\ninto eq.(III.8) leads to\n3N\n\n∂ρ\nX\n∂ρ\n∂H\n∂ρ\n∂H\n=\n·\n-\n·\n= -{ρ, H},\n(III.9)\n∂t\n∂pα\n∂qα\n∂qα\n∂pα\nα=1\n\nX\nR\nR\nZ\nZ\n\nwhere we have introduced the Poisson bracket of two functions in phase space as\n3N\n\nX\n∂A\n∂B\n∂A\n∂B\n{A, B} ≡\n·\n-\n·\n= -{B, A}.\n(III.10)\n∂qα\n∂pα\n∂pα\n∂qα\nα=1\n(1) Under the action of time reversal, (p, q, t) → (-p, q, -t), the Poisson bracket {ρ, H}\nchanges sign, and eq.(III.9) implies that the density reverses its evolution, i.e. ρ(p, q, t) =\nρ(-p, q, -t).\n(2) The time evolution of the ensemble average in eq.(III.3) is given by (using eq.(III.9))\nZ\n3N Z\n\nd hOi\n∂ρ(p, q, t)\n∂ρ\n∂H\n∂ρ\n∂H\n=\ndΓ\nO(p, q) =\ndΓO(p, q)\n·\n-\n·\n.\ndt\n∂t\n∂pα\n∂qα\n∂qα\n∂pα\nα=1\n(III.11)\nThe partial derivatives of ρ in the above equation can be removed by using the method\nof integration by parts, i.e.\nfρ′ = -\nρf ′ since ρ vanishes on the boundaries of the\nintegrations, leading to\n3N Z\n\nd hOi\nX\n∂O\n∂H\n∂O\n∂H\n∂2H\n∂2H\n= -\ndΓρ\n·\n-\n·\n+ O\n-\ndt\n∂pα\n∂qα\n∂qα\n∂pα\n∂pα∂qα\n∂qα∂pα\nα=1\n(III.12)\n= -\ndΓρ{H, O} = h{O, H}i .\nNote that the total time derivative cannot be taken inside the integral sign, i.e.\nd hOi\ndρ(p, q, t)\ndΓ\n(III.13)\n=\nO(p, q).\ndt\ndt\nThis common mistake yields d hOi /dt = 0!\n(3) If the members of the ensemble correspond to an equilibrium macroscopic state, the\nensemble averages must be independent of time. This can be achieved by a stationary\ndensity, ∂ρeq/∂t = 0, i.e. by requiring\n{ρeq, H} = 0.\n(III.14)\nA possible solution to the above equation is for ρeq to be a function of H, i.e. ρeq(p, q) =\nρ H(p, q) . It is then easy to verify that {ρ(H), H} = ρ′(H){H, H} = 0. This solution\nimplies that the value of ρ is constant on surfaces of constant energy H, in phase space. This\nis indeed the basic assumption of statistical mechanics. For example, in the microcanonical\nensemble, the total energy E of an isolated system is specified. All members of the ensemble\n\nmust then be located on the surface H(p, q) = E in phase space.\nEq.(III.9) implies\nthat a uniform density of points on this surface is stationary in time. The assumption\nof statistical mechanics is that the macrostate is indeed represented by such a uniform\ndensity of microstates. This is equivalent to replacing the objective measure of probability\nin eq.(III.2) with a subjective one.\nThere may be additional conserved quantities associated with the Hamiltonian which\nsatisfy {Ln, H} = 0. In the presence of such quantities, a stationary density exists for any\nfunction of the form ρeq(p, q) = ρ H(p, q), L1(p, q), L2(p, q), · · · . Clearly, the value of\nLn is not changed during the evolution of the system, since\ndLn(p, q)\nLn (p(t + dt), q(t + dt)) -Ln (p(t), q(t))\n≡\ndt\ndt\n3N\n\nX\n∂Ln\n∂pα\n∂Ln\n∂qα\n=\n·\n+\n·\n∂pα\n∂t\n∂qα\n∂t\n(III.15)\nα=1\n3N\n\nX\n∂Ln\n∂H\n∂Ln\n∂H\n= -\n·\n-\n·\n= {Ln, H} = 0.\n∂pα\n∂qα\n∂qα\n∂pα\nα=1\nHence, the functional dependence of ρeq on these quantities merely indicates that all ac\ncessible states, i.e. those that can be connected without violating any conservation law,\nare equally likely.\n(4) The above postulate for ρeq answers the first question posed at the beginning of\nthis chapter. However, in order to answer the second question, and to justify the basic\nassumption of statistical mechanics, we need to show that non-stationary densities converge\nonto the stationary solution ρeq. This contradicts the time reversal symmetry noted in (1)\nabove: For any solution ρ(t) converging to ρeq, there is a time reversed solution that\ndiverges from it. The best that can be hoped for is to show that the solutions ρ(t) are in\nthe neighborhood of ρeq the majority of the time, so that time averages are dominated by\nthe stationary solution. This brings us to the problem of ergodicity, which is whether it is\njustified to replace time averages with ensemble averages. In measuring the properties of\nany system, we deal with only one representative of the equilibrium ensemble. However,\nmost macroscopic properties do not have instantaneous values and require some form\nof averaging. For example, the pressure P exerted by a gas results from the impact of\nparticles on the walls of the container. The number and momenta of these particles varies\nat different times and different locations. The measured pressure reflects an average over\nmany characteristic microscopic times. If over this time scale the representative point of\n\nthe system moves around and uniformly samples the accessible points in phase space, we\nmay replace the time average with the ensemble average. For a few systems it is possible\nto prove an ergodic theorem, which states that the representative point comes arbitrarily\nclose to all accessible points in phase space after a sufficiently long time. However, the\nproof usually works for time intervals that grow exponentially with the number of particles\nN, and thus exceed by far any reasonable time scale over which the pressure of a gas is\ntypically measured. As such the proofs of the ergodic theorem have so far little to do with\nthe reality of macroscopic equilibrium.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

For example, knowledge of the one particle distribution\nis sufficient for computing the pressure of a gas. A one particle density refers to the ex\npectation value of finding any of the N particles at location q, with momentum p, at time\nt, which is computed from the full density ρ as\nN\nf1(q, t)\nδ3(\npi)δ3(\nqi)\np,\n=\np -\nq -\ni=1\n(III.16)\nZ\nN\n=N\nd3\nqiρ(p1 = p, q1 = p2, q2,\npN, qN, t).\npid3\n\nq,\n· · · ,\ni=2\nTo obtain the second identity above, we used the first pair of delta functions to perform one\nset of integrals, and then assumed that the density is symmetric with respect to permuting\nthe particles. Similarly, a two particle density can be computed from\nZ\nN\nf2(p1, q1, p2, q2, t) = N(N -1)\ndVi ρ(p1, q1, p2, q2, · · · , pN, qN, t),\n(III.17)\ni=3\nwhere dVi = d3pid3qi is the contribution of particle i to phase space volume. The general\ns-particle density is defined by\nZ\nN\nN!\nN!\nfs(p1, · · · , qs, t) =\ndVi ρ(p, q, t) =\nρs(p1, · · · , qs, t),\n(III.18)\n(N -s)!\n(N -s)!\ni=s+1\nwhere ρs is a standard unconditional PDF for the coordinates of s particles, and ρN ≡ ρ.\nWhile ρs is properly normalized to unity when integrated over all its variables, the s-\nparticle density has a normalization of N!/(N - s)!.\nWe shall use the two quantities\ninterchangeably.\nThe evolution of the few-body densities is governed by the BBGKY hierarchy of\nequations attributed to Bogoliubov, Born, Green, Kirkwood, and Yvon.\nThe simplest\nnon-trivial Hamiltonian studied in kinetic theory is\nN\n\nN\nX pi 2\nX\nH(p, q) =\n+ U(qi) +\nV(qi -qj).\n(III.19)\n2m\ni=1\n(i,j)=1\nThis Hamiltonian provides an adequate description of a weakly interacting gas. In addition\nto the classical kinetic energy of particles of mass m, it contains an external potential\n\nX X\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n!\n\"\n\n!\n#\nU, and a two-body interaction V, between the particles. In principle, three and higher\nbody interactions should also be included for a realistic description, but they are not very\nimportant in the dilute gas (nearly ideal) limit.\nFor evaluating the time evolution of fs, it is convenient to divide the Hamiltonian into\nH = Hs + HN-s + H ′ ,\n(III.20)\nwhere Hs and HN-s include only interactions among each group of particles,\ns\n\ns\nX pn 2\nX\nHs =\n+ U(qn) +\nV(qn -qm),\n2m\nn=1\n(n,m)=1\n(III.21)\nN\n\nN\nX\npi 2\nX\nHN-s =\n+ U(qi) +\nV(qi -qj),\n2m\ni=s+1\n(i,j)=s+1\nwhile the interparticle interactions are contained in\ns\nN\nH ′ =\nV(qn -qi).\n(III.22)\nn=1 i=s+1\nFrom eq.(III.18), the time evolution of fs (or ρs) is obtained as\nZ\nN\nZ\nN\n∂ρs\n∂ρ\n=\ndVi\n= -\ndVi {ρ, Hs + HN-s + H ′ },\n(III.23)\n∂t\n∂t\ni=s+1\ni=s+1\nwhere eq.(III.9) is used for the evolution of ρ.

The collision integral is the sum of the terms\ncorresponding to a potential collision of any of the particles in the group of s, with any\nof the remaining N - s particles. To describe the probability of finding the additional\nparticle that collides with a member of this group, the result must depend on the joint\nPDF of s + 1 particles described by ρs+1. This results in a hierarchy of equations in which\n∂ρ1/∂t depends on ρ2, ∂ρ2/∂t depends on ρ3, etc., which is at least as complicated as\nthe original equation for the full phase space density. To proceed further, a physically\nmotivated approximation for terminating the hierarchy is needed.\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nIII.D The Boltzmann Equation\nTo estimate the relative importance of the different terms appearing in eqs.(III.28),\nlet us examine the first two equations in the hierarchy,\n∂\n∂U\n∂\np1\n∂\n∂V(q1 -q2)\n∂f2\n-\n·\n+\n·\nf1 =\ndV2\n·\n,\n(III.29)\n∂t\n∂q1\n∂p1\nm\n∂q1\n∂q1\n∂p1\nand\n∂\n∂U\n∂\n∂U\n∂\np1\n∂\np2\n∂\n∂V(q1 -q2)\n∂\n∂\n-\n·\n-\n·\n+\n·\n+\n·\n-\n·\n-\nf2 =\n∂t\n∂q1\n∂p1\n∂q2\n∂p2\nm\n∂q1\nm\n∂q2\n∂q1\n∂p1\n∂p2\n∂V(q1 -q3)\n∂\n∂V(q2 -q3)\n∂\ndV3\n·\n+\n·\nf3\n.\n∂q1\n∂p1\n∂q2\n∂p2\n(III.30)\nNote that two of the streaming terms in eq.(III.30) have been combined by using\n∂V(q1 -q2)/∂q1 = -∂V(q2 -q1)/∂q2, which is valid for a symmetric potential such that\nV(q1 -q2)= V(q2 -q1).\n- Time scales: All terms within square brackets in the above equations have dimensions\nof inverse time, and we estimate their relative magnitudes by dimensional analysis, using\ntypical velocities and length scales. The typical speed of a gas particle at room temperature\nis v ≈ 102ms-1 . For terms involving the external potential U, or the inter-atomic potential\nV, an appropriate length scale can be extracted from the range of variations of the potential.\n(a) The terms proportional to\n∂U\n∂\n∼\n·\n,\nτU\n∂q\n∂p\ninvolve spatial variations of the external potential U(q ), which take place over macro\nscopic distances L. We shall refer to the associated time τU, as an extrinsic time scale,\nas it can be made arbitrarily long by increasing system size. For a typical value of\nL ≈ 10-3m, we get τU ≈ L/v ≈ 10-5s.\n(b) From the terms involving the inter-atomic potential V, we can extract two additional\ntime scales, which are intrinsic to the gas under study. In particular, the collision\nduration\n∂V\n∂\n∼\n·\n,\nτc\n∂q\n∂p\nis the typical time over which two particles are within the effective range d, of their\ninteraction. For short range interactions (including van der Waals and Lenard-Jones,\ndespite their power law decaying tails), d ≈ 10-10m is of the order of a typical atomic\nsize, resulting in τc ≈ 10-12s. This is usually the shortest time scale in the problem.\n\nThe analysis is somewhat more complicated for long range interactions, such as the\nCoulomb gas in a plasma. For a neutral plasma, the Debye screening length λ replaces\nd in the above equation, as discussed in the problems.\n(c) There are also collision terms on the right hand side of eqs.(III.28), which depend on\nfs+1, and lead to an inverse time scale\nZ\nZ\n1 ∼\ndV ∂V · ∂\nfs+1 ∼\ndV ∂V · ∂ N ρs+1 .\nτ×\n∂q\n∂p\nfs\n∂q\n∂p\nρs\nThe integrals are only non-zero over the volume of the inter-particle potential d3 . The\nterm fs+1/fs is related to the probability of finding another particle per unit volume,\nwhich is roughly the particle density n = N/V ≈ 1026m-3 . We thus obtain the mean\nfree time\nτc\nτ× ≈\n≈\n,\n(III.31)\nnd3\nnvd2\nwhich is the typical distance a particle travels between collisions. For short range\ninteractions, τ× ≈ 10-8s is much longer than τc, and the collision terms on the right\nhand side of eqs.(III.28) are smaller by a factor of nd3 ≈ (1026m-3)(10-10m)3 ≈ 10-4 .\nThe Boltzmann equation is obtained for short range interactions in the dilute regime by\nexploiting τc/τ× ≈ nd3 ≪ 1. (By contrast, for long range interactions such that nd3 ≫ 1,\nthe Vlasov equation is obtained by dropping the collision terms on the left hand side, as\ndiscussed in the problems.) From the above discussion, it is apparent that eq.(III.29) is\ndifferent from the rest of the hierarchy: It is the only one in which the collision terms are\nabsent from the left hand side. For all other equations, the right hand side is smaller by\na factor of nd3, while in eq.(III.29) it may indeed dominate the left hand side. Thus a\npossible approximation scheme is to truncate the equations after the first two, by setting\nthe right hand side of eq.(III.30) to zero.\nSetting the right hand side of the equation for f2 to zero implies that the two body\ndensity evolves as in an isolated two-particle system. The relatively simple mechanical\nprocesses that govern this evolution result in streaming terms for f2 which are proportional\nto both τU\n-1 and τc\n-1 . The two sets of terms can be more or less treated independently:\nthe former describe the evolution of the center of mass of the two particles, while the latter\ngovern the dependence on relative coordinates.\n\n(\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nThe density f2 is proportional to the joint PDF ρ2 for finding one particle at (p1, q1),\nand another at (p2, q2), at the same time t. It is reasonable to expect that at distances\nmuch larger than the range of the potential V, the particles are independent, i.e.\nρ2(p1, q1, p2, q2, t) -→ ρ1(p1, q1, t)ρ1(p2, q2, t),\nor\n(III.32)\nf2(p1, q1, p2, q2, t) -→ f1(p1, q1, t)f1(p2, q2, t),\nfor\n|q2 -q1| ≫d.\nThe above statement should be true even for situations out of equilibrium. For example,\nimagine that the gas particles in a chamber are suddenly allowed to invade an empty volume\nafter the removal of a barrier. The density f1 will undergo a complicated evolution, and\nits relaxation time will be at least comparable to τU. The two particle density f2, will also\nreach its final value at a comparable time interval. However, it is expected to relax to a\nform similar to eq.(III.32) over a much shorter time of the order of τc.\nFor the collision term on the right hand side of eq.(III.29), we actually need the precise\ndependence of f2 on the relative coordinates and momenta at separations comparable to d.\nAt time intervals longer than τc (but possibly shorter than τU), the 'steady state' behavior\nof f2 at small relative distances is obtained by equating the largest streaming terms in\neq.(III.30), i.e.\np1\n∂\np2\n∂\n∂V(q1 -q2)\n∂\n∂\n·\n+\n·\n-\n·\n-\nf2 = 0.\n(III.33)\nm\n∂q1\nm\n∂q2\n∂q1\n∂p1\n∂p2\nWe expect f2(q1, q2) to have slow variations over the center of mass coordinate Q= (q1 +\nq2)/2, and large variations over the relative coordinate q= q2 -q1. Therefore, ∂f2/∂q ≫\n∂f2/∂Q, and ∂f2/q2 ≈-∂f2/∂q1 ≈ ∂f2/∂q, leading to\n∂V(q1 -q2)\n∂\n∂\np1 -p2\n∂\n·\n-\nf2 = -\n·\nf2\n.\n(III.34)\n∂q1\n∂p1\n∂p2\nm\n∂q\nThe above equation provides a precise mathematical expression for how f2 is constrained\nalong the trajectories that describe the collision of the two particles.\nThe collision term on the right hand side of eq.(III.29) can now be written as\ndf1\n∂V(q1 -q2)\n∂\n∂\n\n=\nd3p2d3q2\n·\n-\nf2\ndt\ncoll.\n∂q1\n∂p1\n∂p2\n(III.35)\n≈\nd3p2d3q\np2 -p1\n· ∂f2 (p1, q1, p2, q ; t)\n.\nm\n∂q\n\nZ\nh\ni\nThe first identity if obtained from eq.(III.29) by noting that the added term proportional\nto ∂f2/∂p2 is a complete derivative and integrates to zero, while the second equality follows\nfrom eq.(III.34), after the change of variables to q = q2 -q1. (Since it relies on establishing\nthe 'steady state' in the relative coordinates, this approximation is valid as long as we\nexamine events in time with a resolution longer than τc.)\n- Kinematics of collision and scattering: The integrand in eq.(III.35) is a derivative of\nf2 with respect to qalong the direction of relative motion p = p2 -p1, of the colliding\nparticles. To perform this integration we introduce a convenient coordinate system for q,\nguided by the formalism used to describe the scattering of particles. Naturally, we choose\none axis to be parallel to p2 -p1, with the corresponding coordinate a which is negative\nbefore a collision, and positive afterwards. The other two coordinates of q are represented\nby an impact vector b which is 0 for a head-on collision ([p1 -p2] ∥ [q1 -q2]). We can now\nintegrate over a to get\ndf1\n=\nd3p2 d2b |v1 -v2| f2(p1, q1, p2,b, +; t) -f2(p1, q1, p2,b, -; t) ,\n(III.36)\ndt\ncoll.\nwhere |v1 -v2| = |p1 -p2|/m is the relative speed of the two particles, with (b, -) and\n(b, +) referring to relative coordinates before and after the collision. Note that d2b |v1 -v2|\nis just the flux of particles impinging on the element of area d2b.\nIn principle, the integration over a is from -inf to +inf, but as the variations of f2\nare only significant over the interaction range d, we can evaluate the above quantities\nat separations of a few d from the collision point. This is a good compromise, allowing\nus to evaluate f2 away from the collisions, but at small enough separations so that we\ncan ignore the difference between q1 and q2. This amounts to a coarse-graining in space\nwhich eliminates variations on scales finer than d. With these provisos, it is tempting to\nclose the equation for f1, by using the assumption of uncorrelated particles in eq.(III.32).\nClearly some care is necessary as a naive substitution gives zero! The key observation is\nthat the densities f2 for situations corresponding to before and after the collision have to\nbe treated differently. For example, soon after opening of the slot separating empty and\nfull gas containers, the momenta of the gas particles are likely to point away from the\nslot. Collisions will tend to randomize momenta, yielding a more isotropic distribution.\nHowever, the densities f2 before and after the collision are related by streaming, implying\nthat f2(p1, q1, p2,b, +; t) = f2(p1 ′ , q1, p2 ′ ,b, -; t), where p1 ′ and p2 ′ are momenta whose\ncollision at an impact vector b results in production of outgoing particles with momenta p1\n\nZ\nh\ni\n\nZ\nh\ni\n\nand p2. They can be obtained using time reversal symmetry, by integrating the equations\nof motion for incoming colliding particles of momenta -p1 and -p2. In terms of these\nmomenta, we can write\ndf1\n=\nd3p2 d2b |v1 -v2| f2(p1\n′ , q1, p2\n′ ,b, -; t) -f2(p1, q1, p2,b, -; t) .\n(III.37)\ndt\ncoll.\nIt is sometimes more convenient to describe the scattering of two particles in terms of\nthe relative momenta p= p1 -p2 and p′ = p1 ′ -p2 ′ , before and after the collision. For a\ngiven b, the initial momentum pis deterministically transformed to the final momentum\np′ . To find the functional form p′ (|p|,b ), one must integrate the equations of motion.\nHowever, it is possible to make some general statements based on conservation laws: In\nelastic collisions, the magnitude of p is preserved, and it merely rotates to a final direction\nindicated by the angles (θ, φ) ≡ ˆ b ) (a unit vector) in spherical coordinates. Since there\nΩ(\nis a one to one correspondence between the impact vector b, and the solid angle Ω, we\nmake a change of variables between the two, resulting in\ndf1\ndσ\n\n=\nd3p2d2Ω\n|v1 -v2| f2(p1\n′ , q1, p2\n′ ,b, -; t) -f2(p1, q1, p2,b, -; t) .\ndt\ncoll.\ndΩ\n(III.38)\nThe Jacobian of this transformation, |dσ/dΩ|, has dimensions of area, and is known as\nthe differential cross-section. It is equal to the area presented to an incoming beam which\nscatters into the solid angle Ω. The out-going momenta p1 ′ and p2 ′ in eq.(III.38) are now\nobtained from the two conditions p1 ′ + p2 ′ = p1 + p2 (conservation of momentum), and\n′\np2|ˆ\np1 -p2 ′ = |p1 -Ω(b ) (conservation of energy), as\n\n′\np1\n\np2 + |\np2|ˆ b )\n\n= p1 +\np1 -Ω(\n/2,\n\n(III.39)\np2\n′ = p1 +\np1 -Ω(\n/2.\n\np2 -|\np2|ˆ b )\nFor the scattering of two hard spheres of diameter D, it is easy to show that the\nscattering angle is related to the impact parameter b by cos(θ/2) = b/D for all φ. The\ndifferential cross-section is then obtained from\nd2σ\nθ\nθ\ndθ\nD2\nD2\nd2Ω.\n= b db dφ = D cos\nD sin\ndφ =\nsin θdθ dφ =\n(Note that the solid angle in three dimensions is given by d2Ω = sin θdθ dφ.) Integrating\nover all angles leads to the total cross-section of σ = πD2, which is evidently correct. The\n\nZ\n\ndifferential cross-section for hard spheres is independent of both θ and |P|. This is not the\ncase for soft potentials. For example, the Coulomb potential V = e2/|Q| leads to\n\n!2\ndσ\nme2\n=\n.\ndΩ\n2|P|2 sin2(θ/2)\n(The dependence on |P| can be justified by obtaining a distance of closest approach from\n|P|2/m + e2/b ≈ 0.)\n- The Boltzmann equation is obtained from eq.(III.38) after the substitution\nf2(p1, q1, p2,b, -; t) = f1(p1, q1, t) · f1(p2, q1, t),\n(III.40)\nknown as the assumption of molecular chaos. Note that even if one starts with an uncor\nrelated initial probability distribution for particles, there is no guarantee that correlations\nare not generated as a result of collisions. The final result is the following closed form\nequation for f1\n∂\n∂U\n∂\np1\n∂\n-\n·\n+\n·\nf1 =\n∂t\n∂q1\n∂p1\nm\n∂q1\n-\nd3p2d2Ω dσ |v1 -v2| [f1(p1, q1, t)f1(p2, q1, t) -f1(p1\n′ , q1, t)f1(p2\n′ , q1, t)] .\ndΩ\n(III.41)\nGiven the complexity of the above 'derivation' of the Boltzmann equation, it is appro\npriate to provide a heuristic explanation. The streaming terms on the left hand side of the\nequation describe the motion of a single particle in the external potential U. The collision\nterms on the right hand side have a simple physical interpretation: The probability of\nfinding a particle of momentum p1 at q1 is suddenly altered if it undergoes a collision with\nanother particle of momentum p2. The probability of such a collision is the product of\nkinematic factors described by the differential cross-section |dσ/dΩ|, the 'flux' of incident\nparticles proportional to |v2 -v1|, and the joint probability of finding the two particles, ap\nproximated by f1(p1)f1(p2). The first term on the right hand side of eq.(III.41) subtracts\nthis probability and integrates over all possible momenta and solid angles describing the\ncollision. The second term represents an addition to the probability which results from the\ninverse process: A particle can suddenly appear with coordinates (p1, q1) as a result of a\ncollision between two particles initially with momenta p1 ′ and p2 ′ . The cross-section, and\nthe momenta (p1 ′ , p2 ′ ) may have a complicated dependence on (p1, p2) and Ω, determined\nby the specific form of the potential V. Remarkably, various equilibrium properties of the\ngas are quite independent of this potential.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

While it is possible to obtain\nsteady state solutions for the full phase space density ρN, because of time reversal sym\nmetry these solutions are not attractors of generic non-equilibrium densities. Does the\nunconditional one particle PDF ρ1, suffer the same problem? While the exact density ρ1\nmust necessarily reflect this property of ρN, the H-theorem proves that an approximate ρ1,\ngoverned by the Boltzmann equation, does in fact non-reversibly approach an equilibrium\nform. This theorem states that:\n- If f1(q, t) satisfies the Boltzmann equation, then dH/dt ≤ 0, where\np,\nH(t) =\np d3\np,\np,\n.\nd3\nq f1(q, t) ln f1(q, t)\n(III.42)\nThe function H(t) is related to the information content of the one particle PDF. Up to an\noverall constant, the information content of ρ1 = f1/N is given by I[ρ1] = ⟨ln ρ1⟩, which\nis clearly similar to H(t).\nProof: The time derivative of H is\ndH\n∂f1\n∂f1\n=\nd3p1d3q1\n(ln f1 + 1) =\nd3p1d3q1 ln f1\n,\n(III.43)\ndt\n∂t\n∂t\nsince\ndV1f1 = N\ndΓρ = N is time independent. Using eq.(III.41), we obtain\ndH\n∂U\n∂f1\np1\n∂f1\n=\nd3p1d3q1 ln f1\n·\n-\n·\ndt\n∂q1\n∂p1\nm\n∂q1\n-\nd3p1d3q1d3p2d2σ|v1 -v2| [f1(p1, q1)f1(p2, q1) -f1(p1\n′ , q1)f1(p2\n′ , q1)] ln f1(p1, q1),\n(III.44)\nwhere we shall interchangeably use d2σ, d2b, or d2Ω|dσ/dΩ| for the differential cross-\nsection. The streaming terms in the above expression are zero, as shown through successive\nintegrations by part,\nd3p1d3q1 ln f1\n∂U · ∂f1 = -\nd3p1d3q1f1\n∂U · 1 ∂f1 =\nd3p1d3q1f1\n∂\n· ∂U = 0,\n∂q1 ∂p1\n∂q1 f1 ∂p1\n∂p1 ∂q1\nand\nd3p1d3q1 ln f1\np1 · ∂f1 = -\nd3p1d3q1 f1\np1 · 1 ∂f1 =\nd3p1d3q1f1\n∂\n· p1 = 0.\nm\n∂q1\nm\nf1 ∂q1\n∂q1\nm\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nThe collision term in eq.(III.44) involves integrations over dummy variables p1 and p2. The\nlabels (1) and (2) can thus be exchanged without any change in the value of the integral.\nAveraging the resulting two expressions gives\ndH\n= -\nd3qd3p1d3p2d2b |v1 -v2| [f1(p1)f1(p2) -f1(p1\n′ )f1(p2\n′ )] ln (f1(p1)f1(p2)) .\ndt\n(III.45)\n(The arguments, q and t, of f1 are suppressed for ease of notation.) We would now like\nto change the variables of integrations from the coordinates describing the initiators of\nthe collision, (p1, p2,b), to those of their products, (p1 ′ , p2 ′ ,b ′ ). The explicit functional\nforms describing this transformation are complicated because of the dependence of the\nsolid angle ˆ\non\np2 -p1|. However, we are assured that the Jacobian\nΩ in eq.(III.39)\nb and |\nof the transformation is unity because of time reversal symmetry; since for every collision\nthere is an inverse one obtained by reversing the momenta of the products. In terms of\nthe new coordinates\ndH\n= -\nd3qd\n3p1\n′ d3p2\n′ d2b ′ |v1 -v2| [f1(p1)f1(p2) -f1(p1\n′ )f1(p2\n′ )] ln (f1(p1)f1(p2)) ,\ndt\n(III.46)\nwhere we should now regard (p1, p2) in the above equation, as functions of the integration\nvariables (p1 ′ , p2 ′ ,b ′ ) as in eq.(III.39). As noted earlier, |v1 -v2| = |v1 ′ -v2 ′ | for any\nelastic collision, and we can use these quantities interchangeably. Finally, we relabel the\ndummy integration variables such that the primes are removed. Noting that the functional\ndependence of (p1, p2,b ) on (p1 ′ , p2 ′ ,b ′ ) is exactly the same as its inverse, we obtain\ndH\n= -\nd3qd3p1d3p2d2b |v1 -v2| [f1(p1\n′ )f1(p2\n′ ) -f1(p1)f1(p2)] ln (f1(p1\n′ )f1(p2\n′ )) .\ndt\n(III.47)\nAveraging eqs.(III.45) and (III.47) results in\ndH\n= -\nd3qd3p1d3p2d2b |v1 -v2| [f1(p1)f1(p2) -f1(p1\n′ )f1(p2\n′ )]\ndt\n(III.48)\n[ln (f1(p1)f1(p2)) -ln (f1(p1\n′ )f1(p2\n′ ))] .\nThe integrand of the above expression is always positive. If f1(p1)f1(p2) > f1(p1 ′ )f1(p2 ′ ),\nboth terms in square brackets are positive, while both are negative if f1(p1)f1(p2) <\nf1(p1 ′ )f1(p2 ′ ). In either case, their product is positive. The positivity of the integrand\nestablishes the validity of the H-theorem,\ndH ≤ 0\n.\n(III.49)\ndt\n\n- Irreversibility: The second law is an empirical formulation of the vast number of everyday\nobservations which support the existence of an arrow of time. Reconciling the reversibility\nof laws of physics governing the microscopic domain with the observed irreversibility of\nmacroscopic phenomena is a fundamental problem. Of course, not all microscopic laws\nof physics are reversible: weak nuclear interactions violate time reversal symmetry, and\nthe collapse of the quantum wave-function in the act of observation is irreversible. The\nformer interactions in fact do not play any significant role in everyday observations that\nlead to the second law. The irreversible collapse of the wave-function may itself be an\nartifact of treating macroscopic observers and microscopic observables distinctly.+ There\nare proponents of the view that the reversibility of the currently accepted microscopic\nequations of motion (classical or quantum) is indicative of their inadequacy. However, the\nadvent of powerful computers has made it possible to simulate the evolution of collections of\nlarge numbers of particles, governed by classical, reversible equations of motion. Although\nsimulations are currently limited to relatively small numbers of particles (106), they do\nexhibit the irreversible macroscopic behaviors similar to those observed in nature (typically\ninvolving 1023 particles).\nFor example, particles initially occupying one half of a box\nproceed to irreversibly, and uniformly, occupy the whole box. (This has nothing to do with\nlimitations of computational accuracy; the same macroscopic irreversibility is observed in\nexactly reversible integer based simulations, such as with cellular automata.) Thus the\norigin of the observed irreversibilities should be sought in the classical evolution of large\ncollections of particles.\nThe Boltzmann equation is the first formula we have encountered that is clearly not\ntime reversible, as indicated by eq.(III.49).\nWe can thus ask the question of how we\nobtained this result from the Hamiltonian equations of motion. The key to this, of course,\nresides in the physically motivated approximations used to obtain eq.(III.41). The first\nsteps of the approximation were dropping the three body collision term on the right hand\nside of eq.(III.30), and the implicit coarse-graining of the resolution in the spatial and\ntemporal scales. Neither of these steps explicitly violates time reversal symmetry, and the\ncollision term in eq.(III.37) retains this property. The next step in getting to eq.(III.41) is\nto replace the two-body density f2(-), evaluated before the collision, with the product of\ntwo one body densities according to eq.(III.32). This treats the two body densities before\n+ The time dependent Schr odinger equation is fully time reversible. If it is possible\nto write a complicated wave-function that includes the observing apparatus (possibly the\nwhole universe), it is hard to see how any irreversibility may occur.\n\nand after the collision differently.\nWe could have alternatively expressed eq.(III.37) in\nterms of the two body densities f2(+) evaluated after the collision. Replacing f2(+) with\nthe product of two one particle densities would then lead to the opposite conclusion, with\ndH/dt ≥ 0! For a system in equilibrium, it is hard to justify one choice over the other.\nHowever, once the system is out of equilibrium, the coordinates after the collision are more\nquite likely to be correlated, and hence the substitution of eq.(III.32) for f2(+) does not\nmake sense. Time reversal symmetry implies that there should also be subtle correlations\nin f2(-) which are ignored in the so-called assumption of molecular chaos.\nWhile the assumption of molecular chaos before (but not after) collisions is the key\nto the irreversibility of the Boltzmann equation, the resulting loss of information is best\njustified in terms of the coarse graining of space and time: The Liouville equation and\nits descendants contain precise information about the evolution of a pure state.\nThis\ninformation, however, is inevitably transported to shorter scales. A useful image is that\nof mixing two immiscible fluids. While the two fluids remain distinct at each point, the\ntransitions in space from one to the next occur at finer resolution on subsequent mixing.\nAt some point, a finite resolution in any measuring apparatus will prevent keeping track\nof the two components. In the Boltzmann equation the precise information of the pure\nstate is lost at the scale of collisions. The resulting one body density only describes space\nand time resolutions longer than those of a two-body collision, becoming more and more\nprobabilistic as further information is lost.\nIII.F Equilibrium Properties\nWhat is the nature of the equilibrium state described by f1, for a homogeneous gas?\n(1) The equilibrium distribution: After the gas has reached equilibrium, the function H\nshould no longer decrease with time. Since the integrand in eq.(III.48) is always positive,\na necessary condition for dH/dt = 0 is that\nf1(p1, q1)f1(p2, q1) -f1(p1\n′ , q1)f1(p2\n′ , q1) = 0,\n(III.50)\ni.e. at each point q, we must have\nln f1(p1, q ) + ln f1(p2, q ) = ln f1(p1\n′ , q ) + ln f1(p2\n′ , q ).\n(III.51)\nThe left hand side of the above equation refers to the momenta before a two-body collision,\nand the right hand side to the those after the collision. The equality is thus satisfied by\n\nZ\n\nany additive quantity that is conserved during the collision. There are 5 such conserved\nquantities for an elastic collision: the particle number, the three components of the net\nmomentum, and the kinetic energy. Hence, a general solution for f1 is\np2\nln f1 = a(q) -α(q) · p-β(q )\n.\n(III.52)\n2m\nWe can easily accomodate the potential energy U(q ) in the above form, and set\nf1(q ) = N (\n-q ) ·\nq )\np\nq )\n.\n(III.53)\np,\nq ) exp\nα(\np -β(\n+ U(\n2m\nWe shall refer to the above distribution as describing local equilibrium. While this form is\npreserved during collisions, it will evolve in time away from collisions, due to the streaming\nterms, unless {H1, f1} = 0.\nThe latter condition is satisfied for any function f1 that\ndepends only on H1, or any other quantity that is conserved by it. Clearly, the above\ndensity satisfies this requirement as long as N , and β are independent of q, and α= 0.\nAccording to eq.(III.16), the appropriate normalization for f1 is\nd3\nq f1(q )\np d3\np,\n= N.\n(III.54)\nFor particles in a box of volume V , the potential U(q ) is zero inside the box, and infinite\non the outside. The normalization factor in eq.(III.53) can be obtained from eq.(III.54) as\nZ inf\n\n3/2\n\nN = N V\ndpi exp\n-αipi - βpi\n= NV\n2πm\nexp\nmα2\n.\n(III.55)\n2m\nβ\n2β\n-inf\nHence, the properly normalized Gaussian distribution for momenta is\n\n3/2\n\nβ\nβ(p-p0)2\nf1(q )\nn\n-\n(III.56)\np,\n=\nexp\n,\n2πm\n2m\nwhere p0 = ⟨p ⟩ = mα/β is the mean value for the momentum of the gas, which is zero\nfor a stationary box, and n = N/V is the particle density. From the Gaussian form of\nthe distribution it can be easily concluded that the variance of each component of the\nmomentum is\npi\n2 = m/β, and\n\n3m\np 2 = px\n2 + py\n2 + pz\n2 =\n.\n(III.57)\nβ\n\nZ\n\nh\ni\n\n(2) Equilibrium between two gases: Consider two different gases (a) and (b), moving in\nthe same potential U, and subject to a two-body interaction Vab\n\nq(a) -q(b)\n. We can\ndefine one-particle densities, f1\n(a), and, f1\n(b), for the two gases respectively. In terms of a\ngeneralized collision integral\nCα,β = -\nd3p2d2Ω dσα,β\n|v1-v2| f1\n(α)(p1, q1)f1\n(β)(p2, q1) -f1\n(α)(p1\n′ , q1)f1\n(β)(p2\n′ , q1) ,\ndΩ\n(III.58)\nthe evolution of these densities is governed by a simple generalization of the Boltzmann\nequation to\n\n∂f (a)\nn\n(a)\n(a) o\n\n= -\nf\n, H\n\n+ Ca,a + Ca,b\n∂t\n.\n(III.59)\n∂f (b)\nn\no\n\n(b)\n(b)\n∂t\n= -\nf1 , H1\n+ Cb,a + Cb,b\nStationary distributions can be obtained if all six terms on the right hand side of eqs.(III.59)\nare zero. In the absence of inter-species collisions, i.e. for Ca,b = Cb,a, we can obtain\nindependent stationary distributions f1\n(a) ∝ exp -βaH(\na)\nand f1\n(b) ∝ exp -βbH(\nb) .\nRequiring the vanishing of Ca,b leads to the additional constraint,\nf1\n(a)(p1)f1\n(b)(p2)-f1\n(a)(p1\n′ )f1\n(b)(p2\n′ ) = 0,\n=⇒\n(III.60)\nβaH(\na)(p1) + βbH(\nb)(p2) = βaH(\na)(p1\n′ ) + βbH(\nb)(p2\n′ )\n.\nSince the total energy H(\na) + H(\nb) is conserved in a collision, the above equation can be\nsatisfied for βa = βb = β. From eq.(III.57) this condition implies the equality of the kinetic\nenergies of the two species,\np2\na\np2\nb\n=\n=\n.\n(III.61)\n2ma\n2mb\n2β\nThe parameter β thus plays the role of an empirical temperature describing the equilibrium\nof gases.\n(3) The equation of state: To complete the identification of β with temperature T, consider\na gas of N particles confined to a box of volume V . The gas pressure results from the force\nexerted by the particles colliding with the walls of the container. Consider a wall element\nof area A perpendicular to the x direction.

Comparing with the standard\nequation of state, PV = NkBT, for an ideal gas, leads to the identification, β = 1/kBT.\n(4) Entropy: As discussed earlier, the Boltzmann H-function is closely related to the infor\nmation content of the one-particle PDF ρ1. We can also define a corresponding Boltzmann\nentropy,\nSB(t) = -kBH(t),\n(III.65)\nwhere the constant kB reflects the historical origins of entropy. The H-theorem implies that\nSB can only increase with time in approaching equilibrium. It has the further advantage\nof being defined through eq.(III.42) for situations that are clearly out of equilibrium.

      "content": "Z\nZ\nIII.G Conservation Laws\n- Approach to equilibrium: We now address the third question posed in the introduction,\nof how the gas reaches its final equilibrium.\nConsider a situation in which the gas is\nperturbed from the equilibrium form described by eq.(III.56), and follow its relaxation to\nequilibrium. There is a hierarchy of mechanisms that operate at different time scales.\n(i) The fastest processes are the two body collisions of particles in immediate vicinity.\nOver a time scale of the order of τc, f2(~q1, ~q2, t) relaxes to f1(q~1, t)f1(~q2, t) for separa\ntions |~q1 -~q2| ≫d. Similar relaxations occur for the higher order densities fs.\n(ii) At the next stage, f1 relaxes to a local equilibrium from, as in eq.(III.53), over the\ntime scale of the mean free time τ×. This is the intrinsic scale set by the collision term\non the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation. After this time interval, quantities\nconserved in collisions achieve a state of local equilibrium. We can then define at each\npoint a (time dependent) local density by integrating over all momenta as\nn(~q, t) =\npf1(~ q, t),\n(III.69)\nd3~\np, ~\nas well as a local expectation value for any operator O(~ q, t)\np, ~\nhO(~q, t)i =\npf1(~ q, t)O(~ q, t).\nd3~\np, ~\np, ~\n(III.70)\nn(~q, t)\n(iii) After the densities and expectation values have relaxed to their local equilibrium forms\nin the intrinsic time scales τc and τ×, there is a subsequent slower relaxation to global\nequilibrium over extrinsic time and length scales. This final stage is governed by the\nsmaller streaming terms on the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation. It is most\nconveniently expressed in terms of the time evolution of conserved quantities according\nto hydrodynamic equations.\nConserved quantities are left unchanged by the two body collisions, i.e. satisfy\nχ(p~1, ~q, t) + χ(p~2, ~q, t) = χ(p~1\n′ , ~q, t) + χ(p~2\n′ , ~q, t),\n(III.71)\nwhere (p~1, ~p2) and (p~1 ′ , ~p2 ′ ) refer to the momenta before and after a collision, respectively.\nFor such quantities, we have\nZ\n\nJχ(~q, t) =\nd3~p χ(~p, ~q, t) df1\ndt\n\ncoll.\n(~p, ~q, t) = 0.\n(III.72)\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\nZ\n\n- Proof: Using the form of the collision integral, we have\nJχ = -\nd3p~1d3p~2d2~b |~v1 -~v2| [f1(p~1)f1(p~2) -f1(p~1\n′ )f1(p~2\n′ )] χ(p~1).\n(III.73)\n(The implicit arguments (~q, t) are left out for ease of notation.) We now perform the same\nset of changes of variables that were used in the proof of the H-theorem. The first step is\naveraging after exchange of the dummy variables p~1 and p~2, leading to\nJχ = - 1\nd3p~1d3p~2d2~b |~v1 -~v2| [f1(p~1)f1(p~2) -f1(p~1\n′ )f1(p~2\n′ )] [χ(p~1) + χ(p~2)] . (III.74)\n′\nNext, change variables from the originators (p~1, ~p2,~b ), to the products (p~1 ′ , ~p2 ,~b ′ ) of the\ncollision. After relabeling the integration variables, the above equation is transformed to\nJχ = - 1\nd3p~1d3p~2d2~b |~v1 -~v2| [f1(p~1\n′ )f1(p~2\n′ ) -f1(p~1)f1(p~2)] [χ(p~1\n′ ) + χ(p~2\n′ )] .\n(III.75)\nAveraging the last two equations leads to\nJχ = - 1\nd3p~1d3~p2d2~b |~v1 -~v2| [f1(p~1)f1(p~2) -f1(p~1\n′ )f1(p~2\n′ )]\n(III.76)\n[χ(p~1) + χ(p~2) -χ(p~1\n′ ) -χ(p~2\n′ )] ,\nwhich is zero from eq.(III.71).\nLet us explore the consequences of this result for the evolution of expectation values\ninvolving χ. Substituting for the collision term in eq.(III.72) the streaming terms on the\nleft hand side of the Boltzmann equation, leads to\nJχ(~\n=\np χ(~ q, t)\n∂α + Fα\np, ~\n=\n(III.77)\nq, t)\nd3~\np, ~\n∂t + pα\n∂\nf1(~ q, t)\n0,\nm\n∂pα\nwhere we have introduced the notations ∂t ≡ ∂/∂t, ∂α ≡ ∂/∂qα, and Fα = -∂U/∂qα. We\ncan manipulate the above equation into the form\n\nd3p~\n∂t + pα ∂α + Fα\n∂\n(χf1) -f1 ∂t + pα ∂α + Fα\n∂\nχ\n= 0.\n(III.78)\nm\n∂pα\nm\n∂pα\nThe third term is zero, as it is a complete derivative. Using the definition of expectation\nvalues in eq.(III.70), the remaining terms can be rearranged into\nD\nE\nD\nE\npα\npα\n∂χ\n∂t (n hχi) + ∂α\nn\nχ\n-n h∂tχi -n\n∂αχ\n-nFα\n= 0.\n(III.79)\nm\nm\n∂pα\n\n~\n\nAs discussed earlier, for elastic collisions, there are 5 conserved quantities: particle\nnumber, the three components of momentum, and kinetic energy. Each leads to a corre\nsponding hydrodynamic equation, as constructed below:\n(a) Particle number: Setting χ = 1 in eq.(III.79) leads to\n∂tn + ∂α (nuα) = 0,\n(III.80)\nwhere we have introduced the local velocity\np~\n~u ≡\n.\n(III.81)\nm\nThis equation simply states that the time variation of the local particle density is due to\na particle current J~n = n~u.\n(b) Momentum: Any linear function of the momentum p~ is conserved in the collision, and\nwe shall explore the consequences of the conservation of\n~c ≡ p -~u.\n(III.82)\nm\nSubstituting cα into eq.(III.79) leads to\nFα\n∂β (n h(uβ + cβ) cαi) + n∂tuα + n∂βuα huβ + cβi -n\n= 0.\n(III.83)\nm\nTaking advantage of hcαi = 0, from eqs.(III.81) and (III.82), leads to\nFα\n∂tuα + uβ∂βuα =\n-\n∂βPαβ ,\n(III.84)\nm\nmn\nwhere we have introduced the pressure tensor,\nPαβ ≡ mn hcαcβi .\n(III.85)\nThe left hand side of the equation is the acceleration of an element of the fluid d~u/dt,\nwhich should equal F~net/m according to Newton's equation. The net force includes an\nadditional component due to the variations in the pressure tensor across the fluid.\n(c) Kinetic energy: We first introduce an average local kinetic energy\nε ≡\nmc\n=\np\n-p~ · ~u + mu\n,\n(III.86)\n2m\n\nand then examine the conservation law obtained by setting χ equal to mc2/2 in eq.(III.79).\nSince for space and time derivatives ∂ε = mcβ∂cβ = -mcβ∂uβ, we obtain\nmc\n∂t(nε)+∂α\nn\n(uα + cα)\n+nm∂tuβ hcβi+nm∂αuβ h(uα + cα)cβi-nFα hcαi = 0.\n(III.87)\nTaking advantage of hcαi = 0, the above equation is simplified to\nmc\n∂t(nε) + ∂α (nuαε) + ∂α\nn\ncα\n+ Pαβ∂αuβ = 0.\n(III.88)\nWe next take out the dependence on n in the first two terms of the above equation, finding\nε∂tn + n∂tε + ε∂α (nuα) + nuα∂αε + ∂αhα + Pαβuαβ = 0,\n(III.89)\nwhere we have also introduced the local heat flux\n~h ≡ nm\n\ncαc 2\n,\n(III.90)\nand the rate of strain tensor\nuαβ =\n(∂αuβ + ∂βuα) .\n(III.91)\nEliminating the first and third terms in eq.(III.89) with the aid of eq.(III.80) leads to\n∂tε + uα∂αε = -\n∂αhα -\nPαβuαβ.\n(III.92)\nn\nn\nClearly to solve the hydrodynamic equations for n, ~u, and ε, we need expressions for Pαβ\nand ~h, which are either given phenomenologically, or calculated from the density f1, as in\nthe next sections.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles\nFall 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
