  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nSessions: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nDescription\n\nThis class teaches the understanding of poetry from the outside in and from the inside out. It is both an essay writing and a creative writing class. In the essay part students write one-page responses to a poem or poems. They then read these responses in class to focus class discussion. One-page because the emphasis is on concise expression of what students think and feel about the poems under discussion. Following this \"outside\" look at a given poet's work, students will write imitations of that work. The syllabus makes clear just what aspects of these poems are to be imitated but as students work from the inside they have considerable latitude. Imitations will be read and discussed in class. This version of the course looks at poems from Donald Allen's\nThe New American Poetry, 1945-1960\n. Allen chose poets who broke with tradition, and while several of them are now established figures their work is still creating waves in American poetry.\n\nReadings\n\nAllen, Donald, ed.\nThe New American Poetry, 1945-1960\n.

You are also required to attend two Poetry @ MIT events.\n\nConferences\n\nWe will meet for two conferences, but my office door is always open to you. Please email me with any questions about assignments or other class business.\n\nPlagiarism\n\nSamuel Johnson defined plagiary as \"A thief in literature; one who steals the thoughts or writings of another.\" In academia plagiarism is a serious crime punishable by failure of the course and withdrawal from the Institute. All of the work you present to this class must be your own and written for this class alone.\n\nT. S. Eliot famously wrote, \"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal.\" Theft in art raises a number of interesting questions many of which will be explored in class.\n\nCalendar\n\nWEEK #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroduction\n\nFavorite Poems\n\nCharles Olson's Poem\n\nPoetry response due\n\nOlson Imitations\n\nImitation due\n\nRobert Creeley's Poems\n\nPoetry response due\n\nCreeley Imitations\n\nImitation due\n\nBarbara Guest's Poems\n\nPoetry response due\n\nGuest Imitations\n\nImitation due\n\nPoetry @ MIT: Poetry reading by Alice Notley\n\nJames Schuyler's Poem and Letter\n\nPoetry response due\n\nSchuyler Imitations\n\nImitation due\n\nPoetry @ MIT: Poetry reading by Clayton Eshleman\n\nFrank O'Hara Poems\n\nPoetry response due\n\nO'Hara Imitations\n\nImitation due\n\nPhilip Whalen's Poems\n\nPoetry response due\n\nWhalen Imitations\n\nImitation due\n\nYour Own Poems",

      "content": "Courtesy of Megan Sherkow. Used with permission.\nResponse to \"The Day Lady Died\"\n\nInitially, \"The Day Lady Died\" was overwhelming due to the abundance of obscure\nreferences. When reading the poem, I continually encounter words which are meaningless\nto me, yet it maintains rhythm. The specific times at the beginning of the poem infuse it\nwith tension; whatever the narrator is going to accomplish in the gaps of time is limited\nbecause he is bound to a set schedule, and the reader feels this pressure. Likewise, the\nconstant flow of movement from place to place gives me the impression of not only being\nrushed but also supplies the tension of wondering where the narrator is going, where will\nthese errands ultimately take him?\n\nThe bareness of the language in this poem is striking. O'Hara adorns almost no\nnouns with adjectives, which helps the poem move seamlessly because the reader is not\nencumbered by ornate images. Instead, O'Hara places us in the poem's world through the\nuse of capitalized phrases. This technique is effective in that it distinguishes the words that\nthe narrator sees from the words in the poem but also because words in the world often are\ncapitalized such as street signs and newspaper titles.\n\nThe climax to the poem's string of action, after the narrator buys \"a NEW YORK POST\nwith her face on it,\" is beautiful. Here O'Hara's naked writing pays off. By writing \"her\nface\" without attaching any descriptive detail to it, O'Hara establishes intimacy. When the\nnarrator says \"I am sweating a lot by now\" and mentions \"leaning on the john door\" I am\npanicked, shocked, and dizzy as I feel my heart being faster.\n\nUltimately, this poem which at first turned me off ended up hitting me hard.\nSomething about the narrator's disjointed journey, his lack of connection with people such\nas Linda who he sees often but has no relationship with, and the culmination in a sacred\ncommunion of grief in which \"everyone and I stopped breathing,\" illuminates something\nprofound. I don't know who Lady is, but I don't think it matters. I might be able to figure it\nout with an internet search, but would discovering factual information about her make the\npoem more meaningful to me when I have no experience of her?\n\nCourtesy of Megan Sherkow. Used with permission.\n\nI can examine the little that I do know about the world of this poem. I assume that\nMike is Mike Goldberg from \"Why I Am Not a Painter,\" and I think Patsy is his wife. I read\nthe poem, I saw the painting, I heard the story. Did it add anything? I like the insider's\nview, but with it I trade off an element of curiosity, a world of gossip and intrigue open to\nmy imagination.\n\nIn any event, O'Hara's ability to find the holy in the mundane, to take the daily\nmotions we go through and create poetry touches me."

      "content": "Courtesy of Megan Sherkow. Used with permission.\nResponse to \"The Same Old Jazz\"\n\nThis poem seems to be more of Whalen's shtick: observations of his surroundings\nwhich lead to long trains of associations interspersed with philosophical ponderings.\nAlthough it is enjoyable to follow some of these trains, such as the weed branches to antlers\nto a menorah to the linguistic roots of the word menorah, at first glance I didn't think the\npoem offered much more than this, making the title ironic because the poem itself is \"The\nsame old jazz.\"\nI found other parts of the poem to be humorous as well. For instance, I was\nsurprised by his use of the word \"satyr.\" Maybe Whalen has some preoccupation with\nsatyrs because he also used the word in his poem \"For C.\" In any event, to me a satyr, the\nhalf goat/half man mythical creature, has little connection to a male cat. I think satyrs\nmight always be male and are known for seducing females, so I suppose seeing the\npregnant female cat is what triggered this odd association. However, Whalen's unusual\nchoice of words reveals the uniqueness of his thoughts, establishing his individuality, which\nis surprising considering that he rambles about the philosophy of selflessness.\nLikewise, the interplay between the two cats is comically rendered. Imagining that\none cat sniffing another's urine is a message from \"Sweet Papa\" to \"The White Queen,\"\nWhalen lightens the tone of the poem, providing a contrast between the earlier serious\nportions of poem where he mentions some of the common questions regarding the meaning\nof life such as, \"what if I never told any of this?\"\nThis leads me back to the repeated question, \"what's wrong with two?\" Originally, I\nthought that this question referred to some sort of profound spiritual connection, but after\nthinking about the parallel between the two cats and the narrator and Cleo, I came to the\nconclusion that perhaps Whalen is satirizing the pensive philosopher who sits and observes\nthe world, thinking deep thoughts. He indicates that the answers lie in the natural\nconnection between two people, in the physicality of \"some of [his] age [whirling] down the\nbathroom drain.\""
